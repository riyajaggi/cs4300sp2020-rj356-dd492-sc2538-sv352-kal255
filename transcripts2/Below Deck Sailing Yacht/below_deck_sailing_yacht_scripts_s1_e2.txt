 - Previously on "Below Deck - Previously on "Below Deck Sailing Yacht"... - This is a big change for us. The boat's still a little bit of a mess. For the past nine months, we've been in the off charter season. Paget was running the deck. And Ciara was running the interior. So I decided to put Ciara on deck. - Paget and I have never worked in the same department. - Paget, nice to meet you. - Adam. - We did have this family between

 Glenn, myself, and Ciara. I'm nervous about meeting the new crew. - Jenna. - Oh, Jenna. - Nice to meet you. I came up like a goddamned Navy SEAL. Everything should be perfect. - Is it a sh---show? - Yeah. - The boat is a [bleep]-show. - There's sh-- everywhere, but... - We had a lot of maintenance to do, so the boat's not charter-ready. There's still a little bit to do. - But the deck does that? - No, the interior manages it. - Well, that could change.

 - This is my first time working with anyone. - I'm pretty green to the yachting industry. - Okay, no worries. - I'm confident on smaller boats, but there's a lot of stuff on a super yacht that I don't know. Deuces. - We've got Alan and Jennifer Ward, their daughter, Emily, and her friend, Peyton. - They want to celebrate Emily and Peyton's graduation. - And their close friends. Alessia and Guy are getting married the day before the pick-up. We were expecting two more. - They're delayed. - They're not as nice as us. - Sail going up. - Yeah! - We're sailing. - This is best part. - Quite a bit of the sail is out of the track. - So the hot tub is not warm yet. Have you had steak knives on board? - Not that I know of. - [bleep]. The crew that's been on board for nine months didn't have anything prepared for this charter. - Hey, baby. [ laughter, cheering ] - Sorry we're late. - You guys have gear? - So let's do it right now. - Are you sure? - What's going on with these people? - Can you marry them? - I don't know. - I've had like four gin and tonics. - Only four? - Four doubles. - This is the main salon. - Do you guys have any tequila? - Yes. - Let's get this show on the road. - Oh, no, here we go. - Man overboard. - Between the boat being a complete disaster upon arrival... - Ugh. - ...and these guests blowing in like a drunk hurricane... - We've been drinking for three days. - We are off to a pretty sh--ty start. - Have a tequila. - One tequila. One. - Anything goes wrong after this, we can blame on the tequila. - I might even marry you, then. - It's night one, and I already feel like I'm drowning. - So how we gonna do these tequilas? - With enthusiasm. - That's how we like it. - Oh, how's that ice cream? Can I try some? - No. - Parker, you get eight hours of rest. Come back at 4:00. - All right. Let me go to bed. - Perfect. - Good to see you guys. - Better late than ----ing never. - Woo. - It's ----ing mayhem. They're wasted. - Oh, are they? - And they didn't get married. - Awesome. - This is what keeps the marriage working. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Being new to a larger-scale boat, I'm gonna be nervous for a while. I do want to ease myself into it, and make sure I don't [bleep] up for the guests to see. - Mama mia, all right. Officially ready. - I can't sleep. Oh, my God. - Barometer, 10 24. - Okay, log reading? - No. - Oh, I guess we're not, yeah. - Yeah, that's the log I read off to you. Prior to working on Parsifal, Ciara and I worked on a few smaller yachts. And I was the captain and Ciara was the sort of first mate role. We always felt equal. Put like a little anchor symbol. - I know, I like drawing. - Yeah. Now that she's working underneath me, it's a fine balance of trying to be the boss, but trying to be the boyfriend. - Cool. - Awesome. Thank you. - You're so ----ing beautiful. You know what? I want to marry you. - I don't have a dress. - Are you ready to start sitting? Adam, Adam, Jenna. Come in. - She is so ----ing cool. She's got really bad taste in men. But other than that, she's ----ing perfect. - So you're comfortable with turn down? - I'll have to be. - Yeah. Because I'm a control freak, I like to knock out service on my own. And I'm orchestrating the junior stews as my little puppets to carry out all of the little things that need to happen behind the scenes. - Adam, Adam, they are seated. - Copy. - For Adam, please. - Yeah, copy for Adam. He said he doesn't want to talk to you. - Then we'll get all of like their used towels, and we'll bring them up, and then we'll serve. - What are the shifts? I don't know what you are. - I'm late tonight. - So we're always overlapping so there's always two of us? - Early girl, normally you're like by yourself for like an hour. - Second stew means that you're essentially a chief stew, but you do all the bitch work of a third stew. Because you're almost like training the third stew. You'll have morning duties. Every boat's different. I'm just thankful that Georgia wants to learn. Thank God. Frickin' lucky charms up in this bitch. - All right, cool. - Yamas. - Yamas. - Madison, do you want to come out with the first course. - Copy, on my way. - Fries are for the girls. - Yeah. - All right, guys. This one can go. - Woop, there it is. - Au gratin potatoes, cream [inaudible], we got some French fries, chateaubriand, green beans, King Crab legs. Enjoy. Bon Appetit. - Bon Appetit. - Nicely cooked. - That is fantastic. - Wait, why you not in bed? What-- - Mainly because everybody that I don't get to hang out with during the day is down here. Like I want to hang out with the girls, and Adam. I don't want to miss out on anything exciting going on. Sleep is for airplanes, man. - I am. I just want to hang out. - Parker's a sweetheart. - You suffer from FOMO big time. - I do, too. - I have a really great job for somebody. You can juice the orange juice for the morning. - All right, bring them down, I'll do it. Whenever I don't have engineering work to do, I help out in the other departments. I could be reading a book or something in my cabin, but I want to be where the action is. - I took some mushrooms. And I was trying to get back to the beach. - Well, you're kind of a fun guy, right? - Okay, so that's a vanilla cake? - Vanilla chiffon. - Yeah? - Can I have something to put this orange juice in, please? - Ciara might know. - I do, but I don't know what Adam's thrown out and put in the bilge. I got a trash bag. - Okay. Definitely needs to be replaced. We need to get that. - Yeah. - There's only a big plastic pitcher. I normally keep it in the galley in that top shelf. It's a little bit frustrating having new crew come on board, move everything around, and then ask me where it is. - Yeah, I gotta do this for a sec. - Okay. - Happy graduation. - Happy graduation. This is a vanilla chiffon cake. - Awesome, thank you. - Wait, you're taking it away? - Yeah, now we're gonna eat it. - Come on, get naked with the cake. Come on, get in here. - This one is kind of one of the ones I used for juice. - What, we're just pouring ----ing orange juice out of a planter. - Yes. - How do you not have a glass bowl to put this in? Normally on a yacht you would serve juice out of a beautiful crystal pitcher. So if Ciara thinks I'm gonna pour orange juice out of a measuring cup, probably not going to happen. - There's that really tall, slender you wanted for water. - Okay. That's fine. Good? - Yeah. - Gonna have the graduation girl first. - Thank you. - Oh, this is so good. - This is good. - It's so good. - This is good cake. - Georgia, you can go to bed. You have to be up at six. - Good night. - Good night. - Thank you so much. - See you in the morning. - Hey, good night, you guys. - Good night. - Good night. - This is ----ing cool. - Stop swearing. - You're so crazy. - How are you both doing? - Good, Madison, good. - Do you guys need anything? - No, we're good. - You're okay? - We're so happy. - Good. - Bonjour. - Hey, you. - Can't you guys keep it in the shower? - It's a little hug. - Thanks so much, Jen. Amazing, huh? I forget where we're sleeping. Woo. [ alarm ringing ] - Good morning. - Could I possibly have some coffee? - Absolutely. - Morning, morning, morning. - Good morning. - Morning. - We were just gonna come talk to you about the day. I know you're keen to really have some watersports going on. And then we're gonna do a Greek night. - So we're just gonna throw a five-minute wedding in at some point. - Yeah, we can do something. - I think they're only gonna do it if we organize it, right? I mean, don't seem to be able to get around to it on their own. - Are you ----ing kidding me? - You want us to do it? Like-- - I mean, we can do it. - Sounds lovely. - Wedding day. - Coming up... - Okay. You have to get it back in. - The bolt rope is not feeding through. - Oh, sh--, I almost had it. Dude, I'm... I'm struggling. [bleep]. - We're just gonna throw - We're just gonna throw a five-minute wedding in at some point. - Honestly, if you want us to do it. - They don't seem to be able to get around to it on their own. - Okay, so we can inform them when they wake up that this is what's happening. - Yeah. - Okay. - I'm worried that the crew is not going to have enough time to pull off the kind of wedding that these guests are expecting. - Okay, now, I'm starting to get a little bit stressed. They're definitely doing this ----ing marriage thing. - Wait, they are? - And I have to plan it. - Oh [bleep]. When's the wedding? - What's the plan? - Well, I'm just gonna have to come up with it, I guess. - Give me like five. - Perfect. - Got to sort that laz out. - Okay, I don't really know what I'm doing in the laz. - I'll show you. - What time do you think they're gonna get up? - He had a few drinks last night. We'll see. - I need those tables out of here. - Are we doing it together? Or you're showing me what you want done? - No, it takes-- I'm starting to take stuff out, to help you. - I know what-- I know what stuff it is. - Look for it and there you are. There's two tables. - Are we taking it up to the-- - No, no. I want to get everything back here. - Okay, okay, I'm just asking what the plan is 'cause you haven't told me anything. - I did. I told you I wanted to come down here and organize. That's what I said. - God, that stuff is thick. - Oh, this looks dynamite. - Thank you. Looks good, feels good? - Yes. - I'm gonna go grab a sweater if I'm gonna sit in the shade. - They're gonna have breakfast now. - Yeah. - They want to do the watersports. Maybe some paddleboards would be good. - Good morning, ladies. - Good morning. - I've got a nice spread here. You can pretty much do any sort of continental breakfast that you'd like. Enjoy. - Thank you. - Thank you. - For me with a chef, if they're really good at their job, they're hot. - That bacon was good. - How is everything? - Delicious. - Just great. - Thanks. - Put it on the transom. That's a knee board? - That's a knee board, yes. I think knee boarding is sick. Does it say the size right there? - Medium to small, probably. - What's this? - That's the sail for the windsurfing. - Is there a rack under here it can fall on? - There's-- - Parker asks a lot of questions. Having worked with Paget a lot, I know that Paget doesn't give a [bleep] about questions. I'm just counting down the days until Paget comes to me to help manage Parker. - Let's get some mediums. - Do you have any idea of where they'd be? [ sighs ] - Morning. - Morning. - Sorry, we didn't have a clue what time it was. Wow, what a lovely day. How you doing? - I'm excellent. - What's happening? - Myself and your friends there we were discussing that captain's gonna marry you guys. - Ooh, pressure. Okay, I'm up for that. - Okay. What the [bleep]? - Darling, fancy getting married? - Is that a proposal? - Kind of. - I think that a proposal... - Captain's up for it. - A little bit more... - Romantic. - You gonna try to go in dry, or do you want to get wet first? - Try and go dry, and probably fall in. - Okay. - What do you have planned for the ceremony? - What kind of things are you thinking? - Maybe a dress, white shorts, and a white thing. - Yeah, I'm so nervous now. - Okay, so I'll start that for you. - Feta cheese. - I'm gonna need you guys to stay on service for a bit. I'm gonna start focusing on this wedding. - Okay. - I believe in us. - Stay in that stance the whole time. You got it. You're a pro. Bend your knees a little bit. There you go. - They have requested a dress. They're looking at she wants to go to a hairdresser and have her hair done. We've got about six hours. Why don't we see if we can get somebody who can source out ten different dresses, something like that. - Wow. - Bring them on board. - Good idea. Good idea. - And then have a hairdresser come on board. - I like your idea. - Perfect. - Where do you want me? - If you see fenders like that, we don't need any more. - Hi, there. I'm calling for a wedding ceremony that we're going to perform. We need a couple options for the bride to wear. It's much more casual. - There we go. - We're gonna do a Greek night. The guests would like to have some entertainment. - Then we'll put that on top of that, and then that on top of that. - We need a hairdresser. Thank you. Chat soon. - Margaritas, if we may. - Sure, how many would you like? - Uh... three-- - I'll bring all three up there now, okay? - Okay, perfect. But I'll have a tequila shot right now. - Yeah? - If I may. - All right, that's the spirit. - But don't tell anyone. I'm getting married at 8:00. So this is like my stag do, so. I actually now I really want to marry her. - For me, I'd love to be married. I'd love to have a go-to person. But I haven't found any guy that thinks that this is a good idea. - Cheers, thank you. - May the stag commence. - Need a hug? - Yeah. - It's gonna be fine. Working with Hannah, and working with Jenna, is like night and day. Hannah is a cold, long, dark night. - The sick woman is wondering if it's possible to get chicken soup. - Yeah, I'll just whip up some chicken soup real quick. - Can I get these heated? They're cold and dry, apparently. The guests are clearing the plates. - We need to... no. The desserts aren't even close to being ready. - I know, I know. - So you say no. - Jenna's like a beautiful morning with sun and chirping birds and spring flowers. Night and day. Now, get the [bleep] out of here, go. - Okay, you got any ideas how you want to fix that sail track? - Hasn't come out of the groove on the mast. It's just come out of the donkey bit. - Stop, stop, stop. Quite a bit of the sail is out of the track. - We have to get it back in. - Yeah, I'll go take a look. - I'll be right out. - Hi. - Margaritas. Yay. - She doesn't need a helmet if she's waterskiing, does she? - No, only for the wakeboarding. - Okay, I'm going to come down. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - What do you reckon? - Yeah, I wonder how flexible the head of the sail is? Have you got somebody a bit more competent with lashings than myself? - I can do it. - Okay? - Yep. All good. - Glenn is an awesome captain, because there's no jobs that he won't do. He'll take out the garbage or, he'll help with the washdown. - I might be able to just pull all the slack out of it. - I really respect that. - Give me a little bit of slack. - To be fair, Captain Glenn's not the biggest of guys. - True. - What's happening is the boat rope is in the track, but not in the donkey. - Let me just unfurl the main sail like two centimeters. - Okay. If there's a problem with the sail, we will look for any solution to keep the charter going. How many wraps you have? - Three. - Go down to two. If there's a major problem that we can't solve, that could mean the end of our charter season. And that's a big deal. - Hang on. - Okay, stop, stop, stop, because it's not feeding through, so I'm going to end up losing it all. Oh, sh--, I almost had it. Dude, I'm... I'm struggling. Ah! - [bleep] - Coming up... - You were getting-- - You're embarrassing yourself. - You guys okay? - No. - They're having a ----ing domestic. - What the [bleep]? - Dude, I'm... I'm struggling. Ah! - [bleep]. - You okay? Hang on. - Oh, sh--, I almost had it. People who come on board a boat like this, they want to sail. So if we can't sail, it's a big issue. I'm pretty much there, as soon as I can undo this. - Okay, I think we're done here. Whew. You know, all the easy jobs, they're always a little more complicated than you think they're gonna be. - That's why we get paid the medium bucks. [ laughs ] - Woo. [ cheers and applause ] - I was thinking for the-- you can fold it up into like that kind of thing. - Thank you guys for taking us. - Yeah, thank you. - Absolutely. - Thank you, Ciara. You rock. - I know. - All crew, all crew, let's get ready to get some sails up. - ...you feed around there. - Okay. - You guys pull the flag up? - I'm grabbing it now. - Thank you. - Sailing's gonna get pretty interesting. - This is the main genoa. - This is the main genoa. - I don't know what you're saying. - The genoa is the sail. - I thought you were talking about salami. - Are we gonna sail? - We are, yes. - Thank you, Georgia. You rock. - You say very cliche American things, don't you? You rock. Rock star. - That's just who I am, man. - Let's see if what we did worked. Here it goes. - Pag, be especially careful as the battens go past the donkey. - Oh, that's amazing. - Okay, let's go, men. - Can I push the button? - Yes-- - I -- I am sailing. - You're hoisting the main sail. - That's the main sail? - We want to get as many of the guests involved as possible. That's a big part of being on a big sailing yacht, rather than a motor yacht. - Yeah, I did it. Okay. - It's inside the donkey, still. - Yeah. - Okay. I'll probably do the last bit myself, if you don't mind. - Okay, thank you so much. - Paget, Paget, ready to come out on the genoa. - I need you pulling here. It's quite hard by myself. - I'm trying, okay? - We're going to try and go a little bit deeper. - Copy. We're going to try and go a little bit deeper. He's going to try and go a bit more downwind. - Have you checked the winches and everything? - You ask me now? - I assumed you would have checked this if it had a black mark. - Is it good? - Good. - You can stop assuming everything and trust me. I hope for the season that Ciara and I can come out the end of it unscathed, but I am nervous, because when Ciara and I worked together in the past, I had a hard time controlling my temper. - Okay, that's it. - I have to make a very concerted effort to hold myself in check. A little bit out more on this one. - You have more sailing experience than I have. - I sailed the main. - The main. - The main. - The stylist and the makeup artist are going to be coming in, so I need your help to clean the master and make it presentable. - Okay. All right. - All covered in juice. - Isn't this fun? This is fun. - Pull the trash. - This is not a fun mess to clean up. - You got the couch? - Got all of it. Ah. [bleep]'s sake. - Oh, my God, this is so cool. Look. - When was your last relationship and how long were you with her for? - Two and a half. We just went different ways. I wanted to do yachting. I was single. I knew I could. - Yeah. - Because I know that sh-- hard. That's why I'm so impressed by you. Ciara and Paget are a power couple. They're in love, and they work well under pressure. That's how you have a good relationship. Dude, when you gonna marry her? Come on. - Like [bleep]. You guys hardly even know us. - If you get married, I'll DJ your ----ing wedding on the boat, and we can throw a banger. - All crew, all crew, we're gonna get ready to start taking sails down. - You ready? - Okay, Glenn, I got a visual on the boat. - Okay, Byron, we're gonna go out to two. - Yeah, that's holding. - Madison, margarita people. - Hello, sir. - I think we're ready for a couple more margaritas. - Yeah. - Deck, deck, Glenn. The stylist and makeup team have arrived. - Welcome aboard. - Thanks. - Ah, here you go. - This is really strong. - Yes. - So, welcome. - Hi. - I'm Jenna. I'm the chief stew. - Keep them coming, yeah. - Would you like another margarita? - Totally. - Okay. - I'll have another tequila, as well. - So we have brought you a stylist and a makeup artist. - Yeah? Oh, my God. - And a hairdresser. - That's good tequila. - Oop, I don't think he needs a shot glass. - On a scale of one to blackout, Guy's already a drunk white bitch on the floor of a bathroom. - I'm not drinking, actually. I'm getting married today, so. - Oh, of course, of course. - I really like that. - That looks so good. - Oh, I like that one. That's a hard call. - That's very cute. - I like the other. look better, though. - Ooh. - That looks so good. - I like that. - Yeah, I think that'd be pretty. - Okay, it's a wrap. It's a wrap. - Perfect. - Done. - Yamas. - Yamas! - I'm getting married. - Okay, I'll have one of the what I ordered before. - The margarita. - I would start giving him placebo cocktails, but it's too late for that. - Hit it. - Chick peas from a can. Hell no. - How you holding up, good? - I am so tired. - And we need to organize all the stuff that has to come on board. - You gotta scrub it harder than that, yeah. - Oh, my God. I'm cooking. - Oh [bleep]. Now I just gotta make a Greek buffet. Excuse me. - All stews please change into your evening dresses. - Okay, so I have three bottle of white. And three bottles of red. - And when is the wedding? - Before dinner. - You guys okay? - No. - Get out of here then. - What's happening? - They're having a ----ing domestic. - Who is? - The newlyweds. - Okay, what... I need to be a part of this. - Like how bad? Screaming? - Yes, shut the [bleep] up. - You were getting-- - You're embarrassing yourself. Please. - What the [bleep]? - You were getting-- - You were getting-- - You're embarrassing yourself. Please. - Oh, they're having a problem? - Yeah, they're getting in some kind of an argument down there. - Okay. - I'm done! - You come too. [ knocking ] - Hello? Is everything okay? - I'm not drunk, actually. - You all right, mate? - I'll tell you what, why don't you get the [bleep] out of my room, then? - All right. Come on. There's no need-- there's no need for that. Yeah, I don't really want to leave you guys alone right now. You have had a couple too many. - Give us a minute, would you please? - Okay. We're gonna -- we're gonna go out and close the door. - Yeah. - Okay. - As a captain, I feel that it's definitely within my jurisdiction to deal with this any way I see fit. If it gets physical, we will physically restrain anyone on board who's becoming violent. And I'm hoping it doesn't come to that point. Can you just stay here and monitor? - Whatever you need me to do. - Cool. - Are they fighting? - Yeah, they're yelling at each other. Yeah. I just went down to try and calm them down. I don't know what to do. - He's obviously had a bit too much. - Yeah. - Parker's down there now listening. So, we'll just keep monitoring them. - Okay. - Are we good now? Kind of bored, yeah? - Oh yeah. - Did you know about their domestic fight? - No. - Oh. - I was wondering why everyone was so tense down there. - You're supposed to go on a break soon, though, huh? - 8:00. - Can I get you anything? Do you need anything? - No, I'm okay. I'm-- - Still getting your hair done? Sure. Get your hair done. - Parker, go down. - Thanks, mate. - Show me what you can do. - I'll probably do more browns. - So what's going on upstairs? - Alessia is getting her hair and makeup done, so, things are happening. - Right, is that for the successful marriage that's obviously gonna last forever? - I'm gonna go full plates, placemats, and silverware. - Okay, what are you serving? - It's family style Greek buffet. - Oh, no first course? It's just gonna be all at once? - It's all at once. - Okay, good. We're looking at 30 minutes. - 30 minutes. Whether or not Guy and Alessia actually go through with this whole wedding thing, they're getting a bitching Greek spread. This is the best cluster [bleep] of a charter. - There's olive branches. They're on the aft deck right now. Can you start making some crowns for us to wear? - Crowns, got you. - I'm just gonna try to get creative and put stuff on the table. - How long is it going to take to make some ----ing hummus? - Everything inside tonight. - Okay, so I can be cleaning out here while they're eating? - Yeah. - ----ing piece of sh--. - Are they the ones getting married? - I think they're the ones who were getting married. - There might still be a wedding tonight? - I haven't heard one way or the other. I'm not going to push because-- - Let's just let it play out. - Unbelievable. - Thank you. - We'll top you right up. - Deck, deck, Glenn. - Yeah, Glenn, Go ahead. - We have a boat pulling up on the stern any second now. Can we get those people on board? - Copy. - Did I do this right? - You can't do it wrong, babe. It's a branch. - Hello, how are you? I'm Jenna, nice to meet you. Guests can sit here. - How we do it in Greece, when the couple comes. - Yeah. - After the wedding. - Sorry, I should mention. - Yes. - That hasn't happened, and it might not happen. - Ah. But we're having the party. - We're having a party, but we're just not going to mention anything about that part, because it may or may not happen. It hasn't yet. - So we are doing a party, what for? Are we going to wish somebody or just. - Just happiness. - Okay. - Yeah. - You look like an office clerk, if I'm honest with you. - I didn't pick the uniform. - Let's go. Oi, oi, oi, oi. - There's nobody sitting there. - No. - So this is rehearsal? - This is what they're gonna do. - I don't think those people are getting married. - This is just like a love... Some people just ----ing get off on having drama. Like, oh, let's get married, and let me drown you. Just like this roller coaster thing. I think they love this. - Okay. - I knew sh-- was going down. - No guests are even up. Going down to check on guests now. - Thank you. - All right. Let's do this. - My crown. - Do I look all right? - You look amazing. - Thank you. - Ready? - Yeah. - Is there anything else you want me to do apart from rinse it? - Rinse it.. - I'm gonna just do... on there-- - Yeah, 'cause if you spray it, it's going to go everywhere. - No, I'm gonna scrape it off. - Cool. - That's beautiful. - No, that's not what I'm wearing. - No, it's beautiful. So is this still happening? - Okay, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. I just spent the entire day trying to plan a wedding. What the [bleep] is going on? Argh. - Coming up... - What kind of mood? - You're funny. You're doing your job well. And I enjoy looking at you. Oh, my God. - Don't push your... - Okay, so, you - Okay, so, you can start turn down. I'll be serving dinner. - Did you hear anything about if the wedding's still going forward? - She said he has to apologize. He's a ----ing asshole. I don't know. - The thought of marriage actually kind of gives me a rash. I remember, like, walking past, like, a bridal shop with my girlfriend, right, and like covering her eyes, and like walking her past quickly so she doesn't get any crazy ideas. Let me know. - I don't know, he just came into the room when I was getting makeup on, and he was like hi. And I was just like, ugh. - Adam, we're just waiting for Guy. - Thanks. Got your goddess hat on? Fit for a goddess? - Oh, my God, every time... my face just turns red. - Every time. I'm starting to think you're baiting me. - Oh, cool. - Yeah, isn't this so cool? - This is amazing. How impressive. - Where is Guy? Is he coming? - I just have to give Adam a little bit of a timeline. Are you ready to be seated? - Yeah, totally. - Adam, the guests are gonna seat. - Copy. - Look how pretty it is. It's amazing. - Okay, you can sit there, actually. It's usually like men, women, and... - You tell me. - We have a-- we have an unequal-- - Yeah, cool. Look how cool this is. - Ready? One, two, three. - I'm the queen, but you're not the king. - Okay, fine. - All right. - Just an asshole. But, um, yes. - What? So awkward. - Thank you. - Can you show me what-- how to level this bathwater. - These are tapenades . You can take the hummus. - Oh that looks so nice. - Here comes meat. - Adam's game is pretty strong right now, huh? - Awesome. - Wow. - And there he is. - Amazing. - So there is some lamb kabobs. We've got shrimp and octopus. Greek salad, hummus, tzatziki. - Yeah, max. ----ing awesome. - Enjoy, you guys. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Very good. - Very good. - Everything's so good so far. - Turndowns are so much better when you have two people. - Yeah. [ cheers and applause ] - Thank you, guys. - Thank you so much. - What's the story? Are we doing any-- same shifts as yesterday? - Yeah. - Makes sense. - Thank you very much, guys. - Thank you. [ speaking Greek ] - I'm kind of ready to retreat. - I am, too. - All right, take care, man. - I am so sleepy. - So are they getting married or not? - It's a definitive no. I'm so happy we did all of that work for literally no reason. I'm the most tired I've ever felt in my life. - What a day. - Good night. - See you in the morning. - How'd dinner go? - Weird. [ alarm ringing ] - It's a beautiful morning. - It is. - I think if I were gluten-free I would just come up with a different breakfast. - I'm not like a eggs person. - Yeah. Me, neither. - I'm not really a breakfast person, and that's-- - Me, neither. I don't really eat breakfast. - Yeah. Do you know literally everything we say we're like me neither. I'm the same way. You know when people are always like what's your perfect type, like, the reality is it would be exactly me. [ laughs ] - True. I'd love to [bleep] myself. [ laughs ] - I'm actually thinking of placing a bet on whether they ever get married at this point. - Good thing we didn't bring a gift, huh? - That would have been awkward. - How are you feeling for breakfast? - We were just thinking we're getting hungry. - Adam, Adam, Jenna. They want breakfast. - Copy. - Here we go. - It was very optimistic of you just setting the table for six. - This yogurt and granola is so good. - Everything is so good. Adam is such a good chef. - ♪ I don't have any room ♪ ♪ On my shelf ♪ ♪ Doing laundry for the crew ♪ - Yeah, that was like, really posh, you know. - It doesn't sound like that. - Yeah. - You know, we could do a full cook's jamlet after these people get the [bleep] off. I got into yachting because I'm trying to sustain this little dream of mine to just like be a musician. I think all of us are gonna become like a-- like a riverboat band or something. - A riverboat band. - First half of my year I spend in the city and I'm doing music, and I'm performing, and I'm recording in the studio. And the other half, I'm a glorified domestic worker, you know. So I'm just doing both until we see which one takes me further. Hopefully the music. - Catch you later. - All right. - Okay, Glenn, ready to weigh anchor with you. - Okay, thanks mate. - Anchor's in the pocket. - Cool. - Morning. - Morning. - Unbelievable. - Can I get you coffees, mimosas? - I normally drink at three. I'll have-- I'll just have a water. - A water? - Yeah. - How do you feel the first charter went? - I think we have a great team. ----ing lucky, man. This is exactly what I hoped for. - Should we go upstairs? - We can. - Don't you leave. - Is there an order you like to do? - So if the wind's blowing from the starboard side, I'll tell you to get on your starboard line first. - Paget, Glenn, are you guys ready? - Copy that, Glenn. We're standing by. Are you on portside, mate? Yeah. - I'll be on port. - Ciara, you're gonna be on-- - I'll be on starboard. - Packed and ready to rumble. - We're all done. - You're lined up pretty good there. Keep it starboard a little bit more. - 10, copy, 10. - Parker, you want to get your line on first? - This is my first official docking of the charter season. And I really want to impress Paget. - Okay, dude, throw your line. - [bleep], just give her a touch forward, please. We just missed our line. - [bleep]. [bleep]. - Okay, port line is on. Okay, starboard line is going on now with two minutes clearance from the transom. Pull it at your slack. - Copy that. - Dude, not four wraps, man. Just need a few wraps. Okay, guys, lock it off. - It looks straight. Very nice. This docking has been one of the easiest I've experienced in a while. We had no crosswinds. We had a decent spot to back into. But you know it's not always gonna be such a smooth docking. - All crew, all crew, the guests are getting ready to depart. Everyone up on the aft deck. Thank you. - Don't you with it was longer sometimes? - I do. - Okay. - Here they come. - Thanks so much, man. - Such a pleasure having you guys on board. - Thank you so much. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - Normally I hate to watch men leave, but I loved to watch Guy go. Get your crazy ass out of here, honey. - The sailing was amazing. - Thank you so much. - We chartered several yachts before. This is the first sailboat. And this is by far the best crew that we've ever had. - Thank you. - As a token of our appreciation, I'd like to leave that. - Wow, thank you very much. - Thank you. - Nice. - Thank you so much. - Bye Parsifal. [ ship horn blares ] - On to the next one. - Parker, Parker, Pag. Give me a hand scrubbing the rubbish down in the crew mess, please. - So here's the game plan for now. Going into the guest cabins, stripping the beds, folding up the blankets neatly. Everything should look really neat. - I'm gonna go out on on the side walk. - Okay. - All crew, can we get everybody into the main saloon for a charter debrief? - Copy that. - All right. One of the things I want to discuss is we were a little bit behind the eight ball getting started. And then all of a sudden, we have a wedding. You know, we have to plan for a wedding. And we also had a little bit of an incident. Someone had a little bit too much to drink. And you guys dealt with it amazingly. I'm very, very impressed. The guests were really happy, and so they left us 20,000. - That's a good tip. - 2,200 each. - Yes. Yes, cap, yes. - That's a lot of money, and I'm ----ing stoked. - Okay. - Okay, Byron. Thank you very much. You earned that, so I'd like to invite you out for dinner tonight. - Yeah. - Yeah. - That's what I'm talking about. - But just keep in mind it is a school night. Gotta get ready for the next one. - Given it's our first charter together, I think we knocked it out of the park. My mother would be proud. - Cheers. - Yeah. - Awesome work. - Yes! - All right, back to work. - It's just overflowing. - That was a good charter. - Yeah, I'll take a $20,000 tip all day. You look good in my galley. - Hey, what's up? Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - Get to work. - I'm blessed. - A common dynamic between the chief stew and chef is a couple rams on the side of a mountain. It's not pretty. But I don't see that happening with Jenna. As a chief stew, she seems like she's got her sh-- together. That was the ultimate form of delegation. - You're funny, you're doing your job well, and I enjoy looking at you. You know, my job just got a whole hell of a lot easier. - Coming up... - Let me in. - Rosé, hot tub, Greece. No. - What are you going - What are you going to wear tonight? - I don't know what I'm doing. - Mm-hmm. - Let's just finish drying like all the stainless and everything. - Yeah. - Just call it out when you guys are done, yeah? - Yeah. - Take a breather. - ----ing spent. Come on. - I'm gonna go shower. Is that cool? - Yeah, yeah. - Ladies, ladies. - What is-- - Ready for the walk of shame. - You look really hot, too. - Yeah, like, what the [bleep]. - Whoa, you clean up nice. - I didn't know we were taking our own bouncer tonight. - You guys ready to go? - Yes. - Let's go get a drink. - Best dressed pays the bills. - Yeah. - I'm in Europe for the first time in my life. I grew up barefoot, little kid running around in the woods, in the swamp, by the Chesapeake Bay. So I'm still adjusting to the decorum of the posh world of yachting. - We got a squad. - Can't wait until it gets dark. - Oh, dude, I look way better in the dark. - Dude. - That's a Grecian hallway if I ever seen one. This looks nice. - Captain, I believe this is where you'll be dining this evening. Let's mix up a little bit. - All right. - Hey, how you doing? - How you doing? - Any ideas for apps? - The biscotto. - Croquetas. - Just don't get me salad and I'm happy. - You're not one of those salad girls. - Deep fried or cobb. - ----ing... - Spaghetti with bacon. - Oh. - Tomato, onions, and chili pepper. - All you have to say to me is bacon, and I'm there. - You're like bacon? [ shudders ] - I'm not a flirt like I'm vivacious, okay? - Anybody got a chamois mop? - I'm gonna actually do the number 38. Yeah. - Penne alla vodka. - Beef filet. - Oh, that looks so good. - I'm gonna say that's-- that looks really good. - Octopus or squid, and I'm gonna love it. - Glenn, Ciara and I are sort of like a family, and I was a little bit nervous about having a new crew on the boat. - Parker, how is it? - Good. - It's interesting and different. - Yeah. - But as a crew, we united which has made me excited for the season. I'm excited to have some new people on the boat. - That's really good. - That's actually very nice. - Good. - Oh, no, we don't want that. - We don't. - That was delicious. I'm gonna get the check and we'll get out of here. - All right, guys. - Really good. - Should we make a move? - Yeah. - Yeah. - I'm not gonna lie, I'm kind of shaking 'cause I'm kind of cold right now. - Do you want my jacket? - No. - Where we going? - What kind of mood? - Staff meeting. - Staff meeting? - We have red wine in the crew mess. - See you guys in the morning. - Good night, Glenn. - I'm gonna take a little shower. - Rosé, hot tub, Greece, hello? - Going in. - Thank you so much. Oh, you guys are awesome. - It's you. - Chilling here with all the ladies. - You dog. - Come on, show me how to play the ukulele. [ cheers ] - Don't. - There you go, Pag. - All right. - Nobody's coming-- - I didn't see it coming. - ♪ Sitting half naked ♪ [ laughing ] - ♪ With my crew ♪ - ♪ Really love my friends ♪ - ♪ But I don't want to see their boobs ♪ - Or do I? - ♪ It's a little bit cold outside the tub ♪ ♪ So I'm gonna get myself in... ♪ - ♪ I'm very drunk and I know it shows ♪ ♪ But I won't let you know that my life blows ♪ ♪ I'm gonna drink a little more Rosé ♪ ♪ I don't care what you have to say ♪ - Yeah. - ♪ I'm gonna have some more anyway ♪ - Yeah.

No. - I think that's enough for everybody. Jacuzzi time's over. - That was the worst experience in my life. I hate... I hate this experience. - Why's that? - It's just... This is the worst. Oh, my God. - Don't push your-- - What just happened? - Jacuzzi's over. Everyone's out. - No, no, no. - Time to go. - This yours, Adam? - It's Adam's. - Okay. - Let's go. - It's us. - First night out, the chef and the chief stew are getting together? - Wow, look at this really nice place we get to sleep. - I've worked on a lot of boats, and if there's one thing I've learned, it's that this could be disaster. I've got front row seats. - Next on Below Deck Sailing Yacht... - We have Whitney Thompson Forrester. - Put all the sails up. - They're all up. - You gotta find the wind. - There's no wind. - Find it. - Jenna, get those cocktails going. Gotta earn that tip. - Oh, God. - I'm really ----ing mortified about last night. Umm... - What's in this raspberry? - Some of the bitchiness is starting to come up. - People suck. Most of them do. - I see nothing's been done. - It's not that nothing been done. You're only looking at the things that haven't been done. This is a completely different side of us. - Ciara, stop ----ing with me.
