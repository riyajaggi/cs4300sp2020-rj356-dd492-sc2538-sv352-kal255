 "below deck sailing yacht"... - So is this, like, a date we're going on? - Chris is great. That being said, I have a slight infatuation with someone who's in a relationship, so everything I do is gonna be wrong. - Kerry and dino are bringing their closest friends along to honor and celebrate her life and legacy. - Dude, I have stage iv cancer, so... - Right. - Yeah, so I'm, like, listen, do it now. - Yeah. [ crows cawing ] - oh, that's a bad omen, isn't it?

 - That's a really bad omen. - I got 24 knots of breeze up here. - Woo! - Oh, my god, that's a hydraulic leak. - Goddamn it! You push a boat to its limits, and you never know what's gonna happen. [ clattering ] - we need to talk. - I don't wanna change. What is this bullsh--? I don't ever wanna have conflict. - We get the [bleep] off of this boat, I hop in my van, and I drive away.

 - yeah! - Thank you, guys! - That was amazing. Your voice is rad. - Thank you. - That was hot. - I'm used to flying solo, and it scares me to wanna change that. - I don't take well to something like, well, this isn't what it should be like, so [bleep] it. So either we fix it or we've pissed all over something that I believe is there. - What do you suggest we do? - Thank you. - That looks great. - You're welcome. - I think I'm gonna go to bed. - You smell nice. - You smell like chocolate. What have you been eating? - Chocolate ice cream. - Okay. - I feel like I put you first in a lot of situations, and that's not always reciprocated. - Hm. - And I think that you can be quite closed off at times. I think that you do that because you're not used to supporting a partner. - Or having a partner at all. - Yeah. - You're probably right. I get closed off and I shut down. - Is there a reason why you're like that? - Maybe it has a lot to do with traveling so much as a kid. - You show me affection very readily, so it's there. But I need you to trust me, and I need to trust you. - Yeah, I have a hard time trusting people. - I know that. I have a huge ----ing issue trusting. I'm sh-- scared. - Same. I'm sorry for anything I said to you. Gimme a hug, let's work this out. It's hard for me to have emotional attachments, because my parents worked internationally my entire childhood. I was drug around in and out of schools. Make friends, goodbye; make friends, goodbye. Of course I want a great relationship. I just... Up until this point in my life I'm not convinced that I'm capable. - Yeah. [bleep] yeah. I know I'm the problem. I'm gonna make a valiant effort to not clam up. I'm sorry for that. - I'd like to go to bed. - Yeah. - I'll wake everyone up when I get up. - Tomorrow's your day. - Oh, it is? Thank you. - Yes. - I'm gonna go to bed. I love you all. - I don't know anything about their morning time routine. - Jenna, what's starting time tomorrow? Ooh, sorry... Um, as you were, yeah. - That was so bad. - ...Sitting on adam's lap. - Jenna and adam are so wrapped up in each other, they're not really paying attention to anyone else. - You little nugget. - And unfortunately, it gives couples in yachting a bad rep. - You silly nugget. - Trying this again, now that you've had time... 7:30 start? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay. Love everybody, night. - Good night. - Sweet dreams. - Sleep well. - Coming off? - Still the oil, mate. - Yeah. - Morning. - Good morning, how are you? - Oh, morning. - There he is. - Morning, captain. - Morning, how are you? - Good, how are you? - Love your shirt. - Thanks. - That's amazing. [ grunting ] - you hold the bucket, if I grab one of these things... - Yeah. - Byron, you think it's all drained out? - Yeah. [ coughing ] - oh, dude, don't breathe this sh-- in. - Can jen and I talk to you about what's gonna go on today? - Sit down, if you want. - Yeah, sit down. Oh, my god, this is a super kind of special circumstance that we're all together with kerry and everything, and it's probably not gonna happen again, if you know what I mean. - Sure. - So we just wanna make sure that we really get the most out of every single moment of this day and time here. So we wanna do, like, activities. - The toys and the banana... - The rope swing? - The rope. - It's a heart-wrenching situation. Literally these guests could ask for anything, and we're gonna find a way to make this the charter of a lifetime. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Deck crew, deck crew, we won't be sailing today, so let's get all the water toys out. - Rope swing. - Yeah, water toys... - Let's get to it. - The... Not the primary, the other lady with the dark hair. - Okay. I had a bit of a rough night. - Well... - I think I've been pretty objective, and, like, put the... His and my interactions aside. I know I was on adam's side, but I'm changing my vote. I've had, like... I've just been... - I don't need to hear that right now, so please don't go there, because I don't wanna deal with it. - Okay. I'm sorry, it's just flipping at you for not reacting the way he wanted to, the flowers, that sort of thing... - [ clears throat ] - since we've gotten onto this boat, I feel like jenna's half the person she thought she was. Adam has started showing his true colors, and she's still choosing to ignore it. This guy's gonna [bleep] her up later. - Hi, good morning. - Good morning. - How are you? - Good, how's it going. - Yeah. - What a festive shirt. - All right, they're all up. Georgia, georgia, jenna. The master is free. Ooh, that avocado toast looks delish. - I'm gonna start on this rope swing. - Oh, my god, that looks so yummy. - They're trying to starve us on this boat. Greek sausage... Delicious. - I was just gonna come to talk to you about the day. So we are gonna have waterskiing, tubing... - Awesome. - ...Wakeboarding, maybe do some cocktails on the beach in the evening. - Perfect. - You're just going straight on that padeye to that block to the winch. - You want that as well? - Yes, please. Spanking you very much. - Just spot-check, everything seems fine. - Someone's gotta do some work around here instead of just sitting in the ----ing galley. Literally I walk down all the time, and it's like... [ laughter ] - like, "oh, adam." - wait, hold on, I don't understand broccoli, tell me more. [ laughter ] - and then you're just, like, having all your little minions do all the work. - Yo. - Yo. - What's up? - Not much. - What are you guys ranting about? - Just life. Okay, I'm gonna go back upstairs and clear. - Clear all the stuff away... - Yeah. - ...And come up. - This sh-- makes me so uncomfortable. - You good? - Yeah, yeah. - I need a hand getting onto the nautibuoy. - No. Thank you very much. - Are you starting now? They'll probably do some tender activities. - Oh, is that... That's nice. Hit me. Chris has brought, like, a new lease of life to the boat. He's very spunky. - Ooh, that's a little bit too fresh. - Little does chris know, he has very small shoes to fill. Very small. - Oh! Ooh... Yeah, and then... No, just... - We're gonna jump off the side. - It's probably best to climb over. - Mm-hmm. - Um, they're all happy, they're just cool with water right now. - Cool, man. - Run, run, run! Keep going. - Okay, let go... There you go. - Georgia, you can go on break. Take two and a half hours. - Two and a half hours? - Yep. - Coming to sweep? - Sweep you off your feet. - Already gone. I'm already floating. - Hi. - Yeah, what would you like? - Two... - Absolutely, I'll bring them right to you. - Thank you. Where's the ----ing stews? Can I get two plastic cups, please, with vodka, orange juice... - Why did they tell you that? - Because you're not up there. - [bleep] - coming up... - Can I ask you a personal question? - Yeah. - You and chris... What's going on? - And later... - One of you guys is gonna up the rig. - It can be very dangerous going up the 60-meter mast. [ shouting ] - here you go. - Yeah, if they want anything, do you mind just radioing us? - Yeah. - This is so much fun, I wanna take one of these home. - Get the newer model, because they weigh a lot less. - Okay, I'm gonna lie down for an hour. - Are you? - Yeah. - Wanna lay with me for 30 minutes? - Yeah. - Because I got a little free time. - All right. - Are your minions laying down as well? - No, madison's on laundry, so I'm just gonna move her. Hello. - Hi. - Okay, I'm gonna take an hour break. Do you wanna be on service? - Kerry, can I get you anything? - Maybe I'll have a glass of sauvignon blanc. - You got it, girl. You got it, you got it. - Thanks. - My pleasure. - Madison, ciara. Can we get a vodka with ice and water? - Of course. - I heard "vodka." - will you check on your wife? - Yeah, what's going on? - Jenna's not in her bed. Adam's not in the galley. Bet you a burger and a beer she's with adam. I'm sorry, but we're here to do a job, not just, like, sleep on someone's [bleep]. - I just got put on full service and laundry so jenna could go take a nap with adam. - This is getting a bit, like, out of hand. When you're not doing your job properly, someone else is having to. And it's not fair on the rest of the crew members. - Mm-hmm. - I'm only one person. Oh, can you get my feet? - I know we only have one charter left, but still. - Whoa! [ cheering, clapping ] - yeah, girl! - It's astonishing to me that kerry's got cancer. She's still such a positive and vibrant person. - Bit high? - Just a little practice run. I'm just gonna give it a feel. - Yeah. - Woo, she goes for it! I've always been a positive guy, and it's just a reminder that no matter how sh--ty your life can be, there's always things to be happy about. - Yeah, girl! - How is it still not cleaned up from breakfast? - So this is what it's like to lay down in the middle of the day. - Mm-hmm. - It's nice. - I haven't felt like this for a long time. I've given the majority of my life to yachting, and I feel like at some point you have to be a little bit selfish. I feel like I deserve this feeling, and I'm just enjoying every minute of it. - Would you like a new one? - You know, a really weak one. - Madison, madison, ciara. One more vodka with the ice water. - Copy. - Madison, madison, ciara. Would you mind running down and grabbing drinking glasses and stuff, please, if you have a second? - I can do that, ciara. Tell her never mind. - Never mind, glenn's gonna bring them in. - Who's on service right now? - Madison. - I got this. - It's okay, it's okay. - You sure. - Thank you very much... - Mm-hmm. - ...For bringing these up. - No worries. - Glenn, thanks for being a third stew. - Okay. - Everything okay with the service and everything? - Not really. I actually wanted to talk to you about that. - What's happening? - Well, jenna basically has put madison on service and laundry... - Okay. - ...So she can go take a nap with adam. She literally just left the guests. - And right now, the guests are okay, or what's going on? - Yeah, right now, they're okay. - Nobody... - There was nobody on service. - All right. - To be honest, it's none of my business, but I'm not gonna lie about it. I've worked with glenn for a long time, so I'm gonna give him my opinion. I mean, he's asking for it. - All right, thank you. - May I have two more pillowcases, when you get the chance? - Oh, sure. Here we go, two pillowcases. - Thank you very much, darling. - It's a pleasure, sweet cheeks. - Chris, chris, ciara. The guests would like to use the inflatable hot dog soon. - I'm on my way. - Hey, doll, would you mind checking cabins before you start back on laundry? - Are they off the boat now? - Mm-hmm. - Chris, fast, full-throttle, pedal-to-the-medal, let's go. - I know, I just... - Are you guys kidding me right now? - Oh, my god, seriously? - Safety first. - What! - I need to clean this bar. - Madison, ciara was just saying something to me about not the right number of people to do your service. Is it a problem for you, or... - I didn't wanna say... Like, I'm not saying anything. I'm just trying to do my job. It's nothing that I need you to speak to jenna about, because I think we're grown adults and we can handle things. It's just annoying that it's happened a lot during this season. But we have one charter left after this. Let's just end on a good note. - All right, thanks. - Thank you, cap. - Hi. - Gimme a hug! Can't get enough of these lately. [ chatter on radio ] - shut up. - All right, let's do this. [ shouting, laughter ] - faster! - Man down! Man down! - Glenn? - Mm-hmm. - What's the weather gonna be like tonight? I'm just wondering where to set up this pj party. - It's not going to be windy. But I think it would be this or less than this. - Ciara, ciara, chris. Yeah, just on my way back to the boat. - Copy that. - So what's going on with today? - Cocktails in the beach, sunset. - Dinner on board? - Yeah. - I got it. - Oh, god, that was fun. - Do you wanna take a break? - Sure. - That was a blast. - I'm going on break. - The heaviest model that exists. [ grunting ] - oh, come on! As I'm lifting the seabob, I can feel my back just go like, straightaway. [ exhaling sharply ] - ooh ----ing hell this is... - I've spent my life playing rugby and working on yachts. Those are two of the worst things you can do for your back. But because I've dealt with a bad back for years, I'm used to just getting on with it. I'm in pain, but I've not got any time to stop. Oh. - I wanna just be in the water all day. - Yeah. - I'd like to go on the hot dog again, actually. - I wanna go on that hot dog. - Oh, I'm in so much pain. The life of chris... Constantly hurting himself. Oh! - Bottom line is, though, you're a role model for me here. Just taking it really... - I'm not a role model. - ...And a really positive, living for now, that whole thing. - Yeah. - Everybody should be in that. - Yeah, and sometimes it's a shame for me that I had to go through that to really wake up, to be honest. - What time are they physically gonna be on the beach? - 6:30, so one hour. - Oh, okay. Come on, chris, let's load the tender. - I need you to massage me. - Okay, so for this pj party, before they leave... - Yeah. - ...Can you ask mark to get the other pjs for the crew? They're in his cabin. - Okay. - Oh. Ugh. - It'd be nice to flame-broil these lobster tails. - Hi, are you finished with your break? - Yeah. - Fabulous. - Jenna's scoping out the beach situation. - Cast off the lines, chris, we're heading out. - These were purchased for you all. - Thanks! - And they're beautiful silk pajamas. - It's like christmas morning! - There's gonna be a contest of who wore it best. - Yeah, of who wore it best. - Oh. - Yeah. - Whoa. I'm in quite a lot of pain, but I've got quite a high pain threshold. Cheers, laddie. And as I say to other people, man up, princess. You've got a job to do... Get on with it. Kick some names and take some ass. [ grunting ] - oh, crap. - Yep. - Uh-oh. - Think we're pretty good. - Punch it, let's go. - [ sighs ] okay. Hi. - Hi. - I'm gonna send you to the beach party. - Okay. - What just happened? - I just spilled off the tray. - Okay, well, they're ready to go. - You guys are ready? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay, we're just waiting on you guys. - Okay, I just wanted to clean that up, because... - Yeah, just get going, because I'll clean it up. Okay, can you guys go? I'll clean this up. - I just need a minute. With jenna, it's, like, disrespectful, how she speaks to me. Her tone is very demoralizing. [ groaning ] - are you ready? - Yeah, let's do it. - Enjoy, we'll see you when you get back. - Paget, paget, chris. - Copy that, standing by for you. - I'm all stressing about this setup, like... - Why? They love you. They love the food, service is mediocre at best. [ laughter ] - yeah. - The last thing you wanna do is upset the stews, upset people that are face-to-face with the guests in the middle of the charter. But then I also don't want them to be freaking lovey-dovey in the mess. It's unprofessional, and it needs to stop. [ kissing ] [ shouting, laughter ] - so welcome to your private beach. - This is amazing. - Oh, my god. - It's our own private little island. - Should I play one or two songs? - Do you guys know how long we're gonna be here? - Oh, I thought we were starting a new life here. Isn't that what the cheese board's for? It's "the hunger games." - do you want a drink? - Have you noticed? - Like, every day. - Georgia. - Georgia. - Georgia. - Our shorts are now matching. - Yours are now matching. - You're on vacation, you're on vacation. - Well, you know, it's... It's... - I was comparing my shorts to yours. - Could you guys stop? The guests are looking. - I've had a better slap from a fish. - This is so beautiful. - Yeah. - Our pleasure, oh, my god. - Oh, lookit, everyone, a girl just came out of the bushes with a guitar. - No! - Come on, paget, sing and take your clothes off! - Come on, pag. - Okay. - Okay, so we're gonna do one of paget's songs. - Ooh! [ acoustic guitar playing ] - ♪ watching, waiting, anticipating ♪ ♪ what are you doing with my head again ♪ - I'm picking up on some flirtatious energy between paget and georgia. Yeah, mm. - ♪ at least I thought I was ♪ - wait, the boat's leaving! - Sorry! - Madison saved the boat! - I like it here, but I don't-- [ laughter ] [ grunting ] - should we go put our pajammies on, everyone? - We're ready, yeah. - Parsifal iii, on our way back with guests. - Cool. - Thank you, paget, thank you, georgia! - Definitely the most fun guests yet. - Yeah, I love these guys. - You know what... - I'm just undoing a knot, georgia. Your mind is in the gutter, it really is. - Was that good? - It was awesome. It was really special. - Can I ask you a personal question? - Yeah. - You and chris, what's going on? - Why are you curious? - Beg your pardon? - What? - Georgia, if you weren't wearing something, I would literally just throw you in the water. - Oh, yeah? It's difficult, because I find paget so endearing. - What about these? - Don't... Don't... ----Ing... Oh, there's an olive here. - I have these moments when I'm, like, how is it possible for someone to be so like myself? It's just been scary for me, because I haven't actually found anyone that I've had, like, a weakness for. Knowing that the season's coming to an end, this is kind of becoming torture for me. I've got no more left to give. - Oh, okay, that's how it is. - That's how it is. - Coming up... - For the interior, I think the service has dropped a little bit. - That's a problem, and it ends now. - Ow, [bleep]! - I like you better when you're stuck in there. - We're getting ready for dinner now, right? - We're gonna put on our jammies now. - [ grunting ] ugh! - Glenn, glenn, jenna. Could you do the table on the fly bridge? - Yeah, we'll get right on it. - That is a nice sunset. - Come on, georgia, step up the pace. You're on deck now, girl. - All crew, can you come and grab pajamas from the laundry? - The only way that would look better... - If it was on your bedroom floor. - Yeah. - Yeah, I know. - Ooh, hi. Sneaking up on me? - This is how I dress all the time, so I hope you're cool with this. - I'm cool with it. - Yay! - [ helium voice ] the weather report for the day... Looks like there's gonna be some showers in the north. - I love it. - Get the boobs kinda in there. - You guys are amazing. - Oh. - What's going on? You've been in, like, a grumpy mood all afternoon. - Just because I'm not perky today doesn't mean I'm, like, in a bad mood, I'm just... - Oh, my bad. - You look beautiful. - Perf. - What are you wearing? - Do I need a belt? - None of this matches! - Oh, my god, we're having dinner up here? - Oh, wow. - Oh! - That's so fun. - Oh, this is my favorite part of the whole boat. - You look like a twat. - You look like a toilet roll, mate. - Oh. - Okay, let's do it. [ laughter ] - yachtie or nottie? - Yachtie or nottie. - Oh! [ cheering, clapping ] - woo! - Woohoo! - Good job! - I'm just, like, cozy in these pjs. They're silky, smooth, flawless like the dreams. - Thank you. - So we're gonna have you guys start down there, and you're gonna have to take your walk. And then we're gonna judge you as you do that. And then the winner will receive a very special prize. - Okay, you guys get outta the way, don't steal my limelight. - Go, glenn! [ shouting, cheering ] - yes! - Oh, hottie, hottie, hottie! [ camera clicking ] - woo! - Who's staying up past her bedtime? [ camera clicking ] - woo! - Yeah! Yeah, good movement! Good movement! - Shake what your mama gave you! [ camera clicking ] - very top model. Oh, very debonair. - Oh... Oh! [ clapping ] - I think we have a wiener here. [ camera clicking ] - hottie! - Work it! - Hottie, hottie! - Yeah! - Oh! - Oh, hottie! - If you're gonna do it, you gotta do it properly. [ cheering, shouting ] - oh! - That's it, jump in the tub. - Oh! - Oh! - Getting wet and wild! - Did it hurt? Yeah, but was it worth it? A hundred percent. - Oh! - Oh, yes! - We have a clear winner here. The winner of this contest gets this beautiful robe. - Ooh! - The winner is... - Turn around. - Oh... [ laughter ] - and it comes with a cash prize. - Yay! - I won $200... Fantastic. - Woo! This can probably go on to a massage for my back. - That looks dynamite. - All right, let's hit it. - You gotta hit it to quit it. - Woohoo! - My risotto! - And it's extra-tasty, I promise you. This is saffron risotto. - I believe you. - Thank you. - Mm... Mm-hmm! - Wow. - Are you okay? You seemed a bit off earlier. - I was working, and then jenna decided to take a break to go lay... - At the same time as me? - Yep, to go sleep with adam. - Why does she keep doing that? - To go sleep with adam. - We're also at work. Like, you shouldn't be like this, like... - Mm-hmm. - ...In the crew mess. - Madison, madison, can you make your way to the galley, please? - Her ears burn every time. - Okay, sauce, and we go. - Ooh! - There's your surf-and-turf, woo! - Oh, my god, it's beautiful. - You got some lobster. That is chateaubriand. The jus is a demi-glace sweet potato puree. Enjoy your meal, thank you. - Thank you. - Adam's on fire tonight. - Mm-hmm. - When there's food that can shut this table up, you know it's good. [ sighs ] - when dinner's done, let's k2r the spots on the teak, give it a scrub-off. - Jenna, thank you for everything. - This was so good. - Of course, my pleasure. - You're the best. - Thank you so much. - Like, I might cry when I have to leave tomorrow, for real. - I know. It's just... - I might. - You know, and this is a special... - Yeah. - ...Gathering for us. - Yeah. - Truly. - Yeah. - Yeah, well, you can tell that there's a lot of meaning here. - Oh, yeah. - It's very nice to be part of that, honestly. - Thank you. - That's very sweet. - Thank you. - It's really nice to have this kind of atmosphere, so... - Thank you. - ...We really enjoy it. - I've never eaten so much food or good food in my entire life. - We're going to retire below. - She wants to go to bed. - I love you. - Good night. - Hasta mañana. [ coughing ] - [ groaning ] oh. - Four hundred or 600 milligrams? I'm gonna go with 600. That should do the job. Ready... - This is one of the oldest, heaviest models. How is your leg feeling? - Still numb. - [bleep] brilliant, brilliant. When I was trying to let it down... - Mm-hmm. - ...It jarred my leg. - Right. - And that's my left one, just gone, mm. [ groaning ] mm, that hurts. I'm trying to grab my radio, I'm trying to lift the seabob, and as I'm doing that, my hamstring, I just feel it go, like, ping. - How you doing, bro? - Stretched it. I'm getting too old for this sh--. - The ----ing seabob, it strikes again. I swear, this deck crew's been cursed. [ echoing crows cawing ] we've just gotta push through the pain, because if not, we're screwed. - Ciara's gonna be the only one left of us. - I'm gonna let him go, we go, you go. - Okay. - Synchronized. - Yeah, one, two, three. - I'm not going, I'm kidding. - I'll dry. - Part of that issue is the fact that there is clothes left in the washing machine. - Making more work for no reason? - Jenna and adam are, like, the kim and kanye of yachting. Are they very pretty to look at? Hundred percent. Do you wanna be in a room with them for longer than three seconds? No. - No one likes sour, moldy towels. - You know, I pulled my hamstring this morning. - With the seabob, my left one. - It really, really hurts. - One of you guys is gonna go up the rig. - Main mast, or mizzen? - Main, because I'd like to do a full rig check. Like, just a quick look at everything... - Mm-hmm. - ...All the way to the top. - I'd love to do that. That'll be great fun. - Since we've had this problem with the oil leak on the mandrel, I wanna make sure that we dot all our I's, cross all our t's. So I'm gonna send chris up the rig and just make sure we don't have any other thing that's gonna bite us in the ass. - Just gotta get it over my manly thighs, you see? - Is that what it is? - Yeah. It can be very dangerous, going up the 60-meter mast. - That's your halyard, that's your gang line. - You're putting your life in the hands of someone else. - And that's your safety. - If the other one breaks, this jams. - If the other one breaks, this jams you. - Yeah. - There's been a few people who have died recently from going up on one line, so. - There's a lot of potential for things to go wrong. - Cool, I'm gonna send you up. - Yeah, let's do it. - Going up. How's your back in that harness, okay? - Oh, it's golden, man. This is what I live for, yo. Should I be doing this? Absolutely not. But do I want to be doing this? Hell, yeah. You can take me up at a faster speed, if you want. - You want a fast one? Stand by. - Yeah, that's better. [ shouting ] the height of the main mast is 62 meters from the water, which is about 190-some feet. - We good? - Yeah. - Oh, it's a good view, man. That's such a good view. I feel most alive when I'm doing scary, fun, adrenaline-filled stuff. Oh, it's beautiful. That's the way life should be lived. She could do with a bit of polishing up here. - So then... - There's nothing actually at the top. That one looks good. - He says the mast looks good, glenn. - Cool. - So are you taking me to the third spreader? - Yeah, third spreader, port side. - Sweet, coming down. - Yeah, smooth as school. - Come on, keep up with me! - Okay, I can see one up spreader light not working. - Okay. - Uno momento, s'il vous plait. - Love your spanish. - That was french. Okay, turn lights on, and then turn them back off again. - Okay, stand by, chris. - Yeah, lovely, that one's working. - Nice one. - Oh, I can smell fuel up here, eh? - You sure you didn't fart again? - Cool. - Lovely, well done. - Deck, deck, deck, start putting away the swim platform, thank you. - Copy. - Breakfast is still at 10:30. - Yep. - Yesterday was really nice on that spot with, like, the guitar... - Mm. - ...When paget and I were singing. - Byron, glenn. I'm gonna fire up now. - Copy. - Let's go see what's for breakfast. - Oh, my gosh. Like I need to eat more. - That's anchor secure, ready to go. - Copy, thank you. - Nice! - Start moving food. - Ah, that's my girl. - You're welcome. - That is my girl. - Oh, look at that. - Wow. - It's the last supper. - I know. - [ grunting ] ooh. - All right, got it? - I've got it. Pain is weakness leaving the body. - Oh, yeah. It's like gold. - My favorite part was seeing you guys on the hot dog yesterday. Like, especially you in the front, going, "faster, faster!" - I don't think I've laughed that hard in a long time. - Okay, guys, I'm gonna start turning towards the dock and backing up. - Copy. - [ grunting ] oh. - Pag, am I clear on starboard side? - Ciara, keep an eye on the fenders there. - Touching fenders. - You can throw it, mate. - [ grunting ] - ciara, your line. Six. - Copy six, thank you. How close are we to the dock here? - Two meters. - Oh, god. - Byron, are you happy if I shut down? - Yeah, happy, yeah. - Thanks, mate. - Madison, madison, do you wanna come help with luggage, please? - I copy. - Jenna, do you need my assistance? This is georgia. - Georgia, I just asked madison to come. - We have signed up for it, so it is quite literally part of the job. Just because it's annoying, you just have to do the job. - Are you ready? - Yeah. - Awesome. - [ grunting ] ooh. - Thank you so much, chris. - Thank you for coming. - Aw, thank you. Life-changing, for real. - Life's not fair. You can be as rich as you wanna be, you can be as famous as you wanna be, but you might not be here soon. - Thanks, love. - Thank you very much for coming. - Mm, thank you so much. - And it should teach us to be... To live every moment like it's our last breath. It strikes a chord with me for sure. We have no excuse to not be grateful. - I would say our favorite part was making this one here so happy... - Aw. - ...On the toys, and... - Yes, the hot dog. I loved the hot dog. - ...I've never seen her so happy. - Yeah. - So, thank you. - They say laughter is the best medicine, and for sure, I did that... - Thank you. - ...So much. - You'll never know how much this means to us. - Thank you. - We're really glad you enjoyed. - Yeah, it was great. - This is something for... - Oh, thank you, thank you very much. [ laughter ] thanks. - Or a martini. - Thank you, we will. - Thank you so much. - Thank you! - Thanks, guy! - Bye, guys! - Bye! - Bye! [ ship's horn blares ] - oh... Pardon me! - All right, let's do it all over again. - I'll get down eventually. - Oh, yeah, so, glenn, I didn't actually tell you. Yesterday, lifting the seabob... - Mm-hmm. - ...I think I've thrown out my back. It hurts, but I'm still happy to work, because it's still... It's not affecting... I can still do my job. - Yeah. - I'm just a bit slower. - Yeah. You should probably go to the doctor and have a look. - Because there's not gonna be much time, we're gonna be straight out again, aren't we? - Straight out again. - It just sucks. In yachting, quite often there's no mercy when it comes to injuries. If you hurt yourself, you're off the boat. - I had something similar, ended up going to a doctor in palma, and he gave me a needle in that area. Keep an eye on it, let me know how it's progressing. - Okay, will do. - Madison, madison, go to the cabins and start making the beds. - All crew, all crew, can we get everybody together for a quick charter debrief, thank you. - Here comes the queen. - Here comes the hobbler. - Charter number eight, the penultimate charter, is in the can. Deck, it's probably been one of our most challenging charters, I think. Hydraulic fluid all over the deck. Chris, I know you've been working through some injuries. - Yeah, it's the back that's the issue. - The doctor's coming, so see the doctor. I think for the rest of the season I'm gonna retire that seabob. For the interior, I think the service has dropped a little bit, definitely compared to earlier in the season. So I wanna have a talk with you guys about that. - For the interior, I think the service has dropped a little bit, definitely compared to earlier in the season. So I wanna have a talk with you guys about that. But I wanna make sure that we iron out any issues that we have moving forward, so that we really finish on a high note for this next charter. That's really important. - Are you ----ing kidding me? That's just complete and utter bullsh--. The guests are always happy, and that's a result of my guidance. - We don't have a full turnaround, so we're back on charter tomorrow. So we need to flip the boat really quick. There's a lot to do. The guests are coming tomorrow, noon. So there it is... It's 12,700, which comes to 1,400 each, all right? - Awesome. - So I think that's pretty good. I'm happy with that. - I thought it was the sweetest charter. They put such effort into helping each other enjoy themselves. Like, I'd love to have a friend group like these people. They're my kind of people, for sure. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Another one in the books, huh? - Cheers! - Yeah! - Woohoo! - Cheers, cheers, cheers. - Let's go eat lunch and get back into it. Thank you very much, everyone. - I'm gonna drink my ----ing champagne. - Come, sit, enjoy. - I got a lot of sh-- to do. - So do we, but it's not gonna get done any quicker by rushing dinner. - But it won't get done at all if I don't get off my ass. I don't think jenna likes to accept responsibility for what's transpiring from this season. She should have been called out on her sh-- way long ago. - Hell, yeah. - Hello? - I need to request a doctor to come and see a deckhand of mine. - You're back in your hole already? - It's safer in here. - Hey. - What's the time? - It's, like, 3:08. Love you. - Where did it come from? Did glenn just notice that she wasn't doing her... - No, apparently ciara and glenn had a conversation, and then glenn came to me to talk about it. I just want us to have, like, a good last charter. - Mm-hmm. - Like, that... - What I'm just thinking is, like... - Well, I'm going... I don't know if madison plays the victim, or if she actually does think she's the victim. - Madison, you're gonna go now with them to the beach. - Oh, my god. I'm getting ----ing abused. There's, like, literally nothing I can do. I'm so frustrated. - Okay... We have to laugh about it. We've all been affected by jenna's behavior. She's not the only one putting up with this sh--. So the whole thing kind of just grates my tits. - I'm just so over it. There's a lot going on with us. Everyone's very worried about chris, paget's injured. - Mm. - Everyone's gonna have to pick up slack on the last charter there, and jenna's being very defensive. And we need to let her be angry, and then when she's calmed down a bit, see how she acts. - Do you have a minute? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Let's go have a chat. - When jenna made the choice to get involved with adam, she knew that her work life and her personal life would run together. And now it's affecting her job. I feel that service slipped severely this charter. That's a problem, and it ends now. A couple of things have been brought to my attention. We've got a big problem. - Next, on "below deck sailing yacht"... - That needs an mri scan. Until we see the report, he cannot work. - This is a serious injury that can affect me for the rest of my life. - When it rains, it pours. Here we go, the last charter of the season. - [bleep] yeah, it is! - Yeah, baby! - Nicole gary, from manhattan. - Living our best lives. - ----Ing beautiful. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - His eyes are rolling back in his head. - I would be very surprised if somebody flew to corfu with cocaine. If there are illegal substances on board... [ sniffing ] - I have to do something. - Do you have a second? He's in deep sh-- if there's drugs on board in his cabin.
