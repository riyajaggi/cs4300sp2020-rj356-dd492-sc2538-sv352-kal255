 - Previously, on "below deck sailing yacht"... You're like my knight in shining armor, dude. First impressions of chris... He knows a lot, he's got experience. - Jenna, stop flirting with my man. - Georgia's flirty, she's a little bit dirty. I like that. Would you like to come to a fish foot spa with me? - Of course I'd love to go to a fish foot spa. Oh [bleep]. [ laughter ]

 - okay, I'll do half, you do half. - Even though I have feelings for paget, I slam those ----ing feelings with lots of tequilas, because that's not okay. - And I'm such a ----ing ugly asshole. - Say again? - What? - Going out with an entirely coupled-up crew just blows dick. - Well, why do you have these random outbursts? I don't know why she's so insecure. - How's that feel? - Good. This is the first time in my life I have a total connection with somebody. - Jenna said she loved small gestures. - Oh, dude!

 - And I just wanna show her I'm listening. I went and found some flowers at the beach. - I was excited to give her flowers. I worked all ----ing day for it. I wanted to make her feel special. - With adam, things can spiral out of control quite quickly. But it's also, like, I know that I'm entering into territory that's not gonna be positive. - Yeah. Hey! - Good morning. - Morning. - Hey. - I get to go get my toes nibbled on by fish today. - Oh, is your date today, is it? - Mm. - Nice. - Yeah. - Nice. - Leave me alone. I'll find someone to marry me. - Hey, speak of the devil. - Hey. - Chris, I've got some bad news for you, buddy... Unless your name rhymes with "gadget," you're not gonna get anywhere. - Where did you sleep last night? - Oh. - What would you like me to start on? - Just gimme a hand on putting these covers back on. [ clucks ] - no... Stop putting stuff on my head. Literally cannot take you anywhere. - Please take me places. - What's going on out there? - In the world? - Yeah. - Oh, same old. - Hey. - Hey. - Um, so is this, like, a date we're going on? - I don't know. - Okay. - This morning is just sh--. I'm over the boat being all couples. - If you feel like it is, then it's a date. - Yeah, a little bit, yeah. - You're looking good, georgia. - You talking to me? - Yeah, are you excited about this date? - I am, actually. I don't really know what to do about enjoying someone's company, because... - Never know. - Hey, hey, hey... Look at you. You look very good. You smell good, as well. - My god, all these surprises. - Yeah. I think chris is waiting for you outside. - Is he? - I wouldn't see chris and georgia being, like, a perfect couple or a match. - Somebody probably for georgia's, like, match of a guy, they have to probably have similar interests, I imagine; probably something musical or somebody who can definitely take a joke, definitely understand her weird way of being at times. Hm. - Aren't you looking lovely? - Getting practical shoes on. Thank you, sir. - Mm. - Well, aren't you gonna buy me anything from the window? - Just window shopping today. - I don't think that's my style, to be honest, so you're off the hook. - You're one of the sentimental ones, eh? - Hi there. - Hi. - Hello. - Room for two? - Sink them both slowly, please. Get ready for the attack. - Hope you're hungry, little guys. - Ooh! [ laughter ] - so weird. - Why did you pick this? - Normal is boring. I feel like I'm sexy, but I'm also a niche. That's why I like to keep people on their toes. - Why do I feel like mine are more busy than yours? - They are all over you. - Hi. - Hi, can I get a soft drink? - What would you like? - Fanta, please. Most yachties are running away from something. Hearing about madison's sister last night really puts things into perspective. What happened? - Her sister was murdered. - It's an enormous ordeal for anybody to lose a sibling like that, especially in tragic circumstances. No wonder she fights so hard to stay positive. Thank you. - Are you used to being on charter boats? - Yeah, I'd like to run a boat, just me and a girl, a small boat. - The industry enables a lot of people's dreams. I think that's why a lot of us are in it. - Yeah. - Chris is great. That being said, I admit that I have a slight infatuation with someone who's in a relationship. So what the [bleep] am I supposed to be doing right now? Everything I do is gonna be wrong. - Great. - You guys need a nap now. - Bye, guys. - Thank you very much. - Bye-bye. - Bye! - Bye! - All right, back to the real world. - Yeah, [bleep]. - Bye-bye, fake world. - It was good while it lasted, right? - Yeah. - Hello, lovely kids. - Oh, hey. - Oh, hey. - Hi, guys. - We went and got that fish foot massage today. - Can I see your feet? - I've gotta say... - Wow, they look so much better. - Fresh, fresh, fresh! - Do they ever take, like, a chunk of good skin? - How was your date? - Incredibly invasive, but enjoyable. - That's chris... Invasive and enjoyable. - I need to slip away for a second, guys. I think I'm very overdue somewhere. - All right. - All right, see you later. - See you later, darling. - See you later, honey. - How's it going? - Real good. Real ----ing good. - I've gotta tell you something now. Last night, everyone was kind of thrown off by you being quite, um... Upset. - I'm such a ----ing ugly asshole. - Everyone was just asking what was wrong. It was definitely, like, I don't know, like, is there something that's happened in her life? And then they were like like what sort of trauma stuff. I answered that... - That's not your place. - I know, I'm sorry. - That's so not your place. - I know, that's why I'm just telling you now. I just needed to get it off my chest. I'm sorry. - That's really ----ed up, georgia. - I know that's it's ----ed up, that's why I'm telling you. - Whenever I have an emotion, to have it be about my sister is so beyond ----ed up. I'm so done with this sh--. My sister is not a thing. This is ----ing bullsh--. - I wasn't trying to make it about your sister. It was more to give a bit of insight so that people would back off a bit. - Jesus [bleep]. Last night had nothing to do with my sister. - I know it didn't. Well, you were really upset last night about... - I was not upset! I was annoyed that it was all couple, couple, couple. If I've had a trauma in my life, georgia, it's not your place to tell. - I know it's not. - This is such bullsh--. Oh, I'm pissed off. - Coming up... - We're doing 12 knots. - Whoa! - [ shouting ] ow! - Yeehaw! - This is insane. - I got this, I got this. - We're all gonna die. - I was not upset! I was annoyed that it was all couple, couple, couple. I'm sorry someone's sister getting murdered, that is not your place to tell. - I know. - Oh, I am pissed off. - I don't know the story. She told people about... - That my mood is because of my sister. - I didn't say that, madison. - [ scoffs ] ugh. - Mads, can I just say something? - No, dude, I'm, like, actually really ----ing annoyed right now. Like, I'm annoyed. Everyone else on the crew has someone. At least I thought I had georgia. But my personal life should be my personal life until I tell someone about it. So my trust is betrayed. - For sure. It's your situation... I don't know what her intent was. I don't think it was bad intent. I do understand, and I would probably feel the same. I don't wanna see you upset. I think maybe just everyone takes a breather and then can reassess in a bit. - Paget, jenna, adam, can you guys meet me in the crew mess? We're gonna do a preference sheet meeting. - Copy for adam. - Copy. - So here we go... We've got kerry mcreynolds and dino cresci, best friends of 27 years. Kerry is a retail sales manager, and dino is an interior designer who also manages restaurants in san diego. - Nice. - Kerry is battling stage four cancer and is no longer in remission. Wow. Kerry and dino are bringing their closest friends along to honor and celebrate her life and legacy. - You know, you've got weeks or months to live... Is this gonna be one of their last opportunities to do something like this? So you really wanna make sure that you go all-out, especially for her. - All the guests are looking forward to as much sailing as possible. On night one, the guests are requesting an upscale dinner party to celebrate mark's birthday with a birthday cake delivered "by a hot deckhand." [ laughs ] oof, who's that gonna be? On night two, dino and kerry would like to have a vintage 1960s-style pajama party. - On date two, the guests would like to enjoy water sports, some sort of beach event, cocktails in a secluded bay. We can do that. - Kerry doesn't like smelly seafood. Dislikes for jennifer, she is "emotionally allergic to mayonnaise." [ chuckling ] - what does that mean? - Good ----ing question. - She's just being funny. - That's awesome. We have the most important charter of the season right now. All I'm thinking about's jenna. Honest to god, today is not the day. I'm gonna ----ing lose my sh--. - I think we're getting better with every charter. - That's right. - And we just wanna keep that energy up and give these people the experience of their lifetime. - Sounds good. - Cool. - Let's move. - Thank you. [ sighs ] I would have something weighing on me if I didn't actually just say what I've done. But if it was me, it would really ----ing hurt. And I don't like that I'm accidentally inflicting that on someone. I don't like upsetting people. This is not... It's not the person I wanna be. - All right, getting there, getting there. - Getting there. [ laughter ] - quite nice snap. - Don't make me jealous, all right? I need a spank every now and again, too. - Pardon? - You can't leave me out, all right? No preferential treatment for the deck crew. - Hoo! - If you're gonna spank her, you have to spank me, too. - Careful, he will. - Oh, and I would enjoy it. I mean, what? What? Huh? - Hi. - Hi. Sorry. - It's just... Can you understand, like, I've gone through enough in my life. I don't need this sh--. - I'm pretty ----ing humiliated that I'm the idiot that's upset you that much, ever. - Can I have a hug? - I have no idea why. I really do love madison, and I know how much it's not fair. The situation shouldn't have really occurred to begin with. This is just embarrassing to me to drop the ball. - I love you too. Why do you love me? You're-- - personality and nice titties? - [ yawning ] oof. [ alarm buzzing ] - morning. - Morning. - How'd you sleep? - Good. - What are we expecting for these next charter guests? - No mayonnaise. - No mayonnaise. - What are we expecting? - The primary has cancer that's not in remission. - Mm. - So my suggestion is, you know, really striving for perfection. I want this to be the best trip of her life. - Hells yeah. - They've also requested to have a hot deckhand deliver a birthday cake tonight, so yeah. Yeah. - All crew, all crew, the provisions are on the dock. - Copy, coming. - What's up, guys? - Thank you, sir. - Yep. - [ grunting ] ugh. - What is that? No, no, no. Why would you even send me that crap? What the hell am I supposed to do with this? I have to have the tuna fresh, never frozen. This is frozen garbage. Why do you keep bringing me this? - Stop sending me sh--. It's ----ing garbage. I'm taking it anyway because I don't have time. [bleep]. ----Ing pathetic. Fresh off the ----ing truck... Awesome, thanks, guys. [bleep]. Fresh, never frozen. - That's for jenna, straight into her cabin. - I have an actual dick to deal with. - You're ----ing kidding me. Where's the vegetables? - Adam is throwing a tantrum. He's, like, fruit loop crazy. - [bleep] - why is he so grumpy? - Dunno. - I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with the food. We're sitting in a factory full of fireworks, and jenna's got a match. - It's ----ing two hours before guest arrival. That's goddamn bullsh-- and you ----ing know it. ----Ing what the [bleep] is going on? I'm ----ing pissed. My produce isn't even here. [bleep] ----ing momos. Suck a dick. That's goddamn bullsh--. ----Ing momos. - That's for jenna, straight into her cabin. - I have an actual dick to deal with. That's it for now. - I've worked with a lot of couples on board. I suspect adam is having some personal problems right now. - Put the frozen sh-- tuna in the freezer, where it belongs. - You know, I don't wanna get involved in their personal thing unless it's hurting the guest experience. So right now, I'm going to let him take a breath, because, you know, never in the history of calming down has anyone calmed down by being told to calm down. - Mm, yum, rock-hard baguettes. ----Ing garbage. [ glass shatters ] - few more scuppers... Covers off, scuppers done. - Hey, georgia? - Yes? - There still, like, piles of dust in this back corner. Otherwise everything looks good. - Dude, I had a freaking wicked nightmare. The boat was sinking and [bleep]. Gimme some good news. - It's nice weather outside. - And? - That's the good news. - Yeah. [ crows cawing ] - that's not good luck. - That's not good luck at all. - That's a bad omen, isn't it? - That's a really bad omen. - Guys, this is not a good time... - That's a really bad... - [bleep] get outta there! Go on! [ hissing, shouting ] - that's bad. - That's weird. And they, like, really flocked all of a sudden to our mast. - Glenn, glenn, pag. Just to let you know, we had a whole flock of crows on our mizzen mast. - Uh-oh. As far as superstition goes, crows can be a bad omen. You know, there's a lot of superstitions in sailing. One of the things you're not supposed to do is whistle on a boat. [ whistling ] - that's called "whistling up the wind," and you might get a storm. - [ whistling ] - you're not supposed to take bananas on a boat; that's bad luck. [ whistling ] - I think it probably comes from back in the day, when it was quite dangerous to go to sea. Like they say, the sea can be a harsh mistress. - All crew, all crew, let's get in our charter gear. Guests should be arriving in about 15 minutes. - [bleep] you're ----ing kidding me. - Let's get ready to charter! - Really scared. - About what? - The crows. - All crew, all crew, I think I see guests coming down the dock, so let's get everybody out on the aft deck, please. - This is amazing. - This is so beautiful. - Yeah, this is gorgeous. I can't believe this is our life right now. - Hi! - I'm kerry. - I'm captain glenn, nice to meet you. - Hi, captain glenn, how are you? - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Welcome aboard. - Adam, nice to meet you. - Byron, nice to meet you. - We'd just like to formally welcome you on board parsifal iii. - Cheers, thank you for having us. - We have a great few days planned. We're gonna do some sailing, lots of water sports. - Woohoo! - Jenna's gonna take you on a little tour of the boat. - Let's do it, jen. - Perfect. - All right. - This is the fly bridge. - This is rad. - This is a great spot for when we go sailing. - I like guests that bring luggage and not baggage. - We'll take you down to the guest cabin area. This is your master cabin. - Wow. - Quite spacious. - This is where the magic happens. - This is where the magic happens. - Yes! - Three, two, one... - Okay, byron, whenever you wanna start, take it up. - Copy. Four meters on starboard side and holding. - Both anchors secure. - Yep, cool. - Okay, glenn, our stern is clear of their bow. - Thanks, mate. - This is like... I have never been on a boat of this size in my whole life. - Look at these. - I feel like it's so fancy, the hardware and everything. [ sighs ] - all crew, all crew, we're gonna start getting sails up. - Copy, thank you, glenn. - You know, I'm gonna try and bring it out on... - The mizzen? - Sails are going up now. - Ooh! - I thought you had to do it by hand. - No, nothing is by hand. - Two of the best pleasures in life are by hand. - Let's go main. If you guys wanna start walking out the lazy sheet. - It comes out a bit faster than the other one. - This is all right, isn't it? - Okay, you've got, like, two meters to go. - Hold... Genoa coming out now. - Engine off? - Yep, you can switch off. - We are sailing... Nice. - So we're sailing... That's the engine off. - Woohoo! This is amazing. - Ship, ship, ship, we're starting to sail. - Cool, thanks for the notice. - That's amazing. Look at that. - It's so tense right now. Hm, interesting... I think they're fighting. [ snorts ] - oh, my god, there's good wind! - Oh, my god. - Rad! - This is so cool. - Oh. - We've lost the monitor. - Uh, that's important. [ whistling ] - because of the wind. [ echoing caws ] - hey, we're doing 12 knots. - Wow! - Oh, nice, nice. - The wind just came up right now, right? - Careful... - This is gonna be a really good sail, so I'd make sure everything's stowed really well. [ clattering, rattling ] - this is way more wind than was forecast. - [ shouting ] wait! - Yeah, we're totally, like... - Definitely a bit more breeze now. - Oh [bleep]. - Eighteen degrees. - Yeah. - Whoa. - Whoa! - This is crazy. - Ah! - Call this sailing? Come on. Surely you can bend this bitch over a little harder. - It's making me feel sick. - We're fine, just... - Woo! - I love sailing, but not when I'm working. [ whistling ] - yeah, we got 24 knots all of a sudden. - Oh, my god. Oh! - Oh, that's no good. - I got 24 knots at least up here. I need everybody up on deck. - Got it. - Ow! [ clattering ] - holy sh--. - Yeehaw! - Ride 'em, cowboy! - Oh, my god, this is insane. - We're about to go man overboard. - I got this, I got this. - We're all gonna die. - Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my gosh. Ow! - Holy sh--. - Yeehaw! - Please, this is insane. - I got this. - [bleep] - I got 24 knots of breeze up here. I need everybody up on the foredeck. When the wind picks up suddenly, you gotta be on your toes. [ laughs ] - keep turning down, if you can. - [bleep] - there's no way around it, so I've gotta go as close to the wind as possible. That reduces the heeling. - Oh, god. - It's, like, crushing me. - Doesn't it look like I'm, like, going uphill? - Yeah. - Yeah, but... - Like michael jackson. - I can't move... Oh. - That's a good angle. You can stop there. - Oh! [ cheering, clapping ] - yay! - Parsifal sails really well. We push her hard, and she lives up to the challenge every time. - Whew! - Oh, my god, that hurt so bad. - [ gasps ] look at this! - Yeah, that's amazing. - May I get you some more soda water? - Not right now, thank you so much. - No problem. - How long have you been in the charter business? - Eight years, on and off. I just like moving, and I do not like a 9:00 to 5:00. I could die tomorrow, this is what I'm doing. - Dude, I have stage four cancer, so... - Right. - Yeah, so I'm, like, listen... Do it now. - Yeah. Considering kerry's health condition, her attitude is so positive. That takes so much strength. I've had personal experience with my dad dying of cancer, and I will bust my ass to make sure this is the best trip of her life. My dad died of cancer, so I was in that same stage where it was like... - Oh, when? - Four years ago. Before my dad died, I got him a book. And one of the things in there that he had to fill out was, you know, what kind of legacy do you wanna leave. He wrote that he wanted to have made people laugh. I've always valued that in myself, that I love making people laugh. And that's what I would wanna leave. I think that sadly, once we're gone, your memory fades pretty quickly, and I don't wanna think so much about what I wanna leave. I wanna think about what I wanna do while I'm here. I think that honestly, the positive attitude helps so much. - Hundred percent. I wish I would have learned this lesson earlier. Unfortunately, it took me to have cancer to realize. - How's your day? How are things? How's life? - Eh, good, my back's hurting like a mother----er. - Me, too. Dude, I ----ing hate getting old. - ♪ just 10 more meals, so who gives a [bleep] ♪ - I'm gonna go wash up for lunch and stuff. - You go change into another outfit. - Change, yeah. - You ready? We're gonna drop these sails. - Okay. - We'll pull both main and mizzen down at the same time. - Okay, you're head to wind. - That's looking good. - Okay, you wanna drop anchor in there? - Uh, yeah. - Yeah, that looks like a pretty solid bite to me. - Oh, my god... That's a hydraulic leak. Everywhere, man. It's absolutely everywhere. - Glenn, we got oil on the deck here. - Goddamn it! - Sh--. - It's all down starboard side as well. Be very careful on deck, there's oil everywhere. Well, at this stage, we'll just try and stop it going overboard. - Ooh, that is a lot of oil, jesus. - Any idea where it's coming from? - It's coming out of the two caps there... - Yeah, the two caps. - ... Those stainless caps. - When you push a boat to its limits, then you never know what's gonna happen. - This could have been the bad luck thing from the crows. - The crows... You remember the crows? The ----ing crows on the mast. - Yeah. [ caw echoing ] this oil is already where it is, so let's keep one or two people on this, let's get the stern door open. - Okay, ciara... - Thank you. - Ciara, you wanna go back? - Madison, jenna. I need to start getting the lunch going. - Of course. - I had chemo, I got no hair. It comes all off. [ laughter ] - the bright side of cancer... You don't need to wax. - Brazilian. - Totally, yeah. - Really? Everything goes? - Yeah. - Chris, you should get cancer. - Waiting is the only fun part. - Where do you wanna sit? - I guess we can start taking stuff. - Thanks, chef. - We've got a whole bunch of food coming up. - Look at how amazing that shrimp looks. And I'm not, like, a shrimp person. - So how we doing so far? - Amazing. - This'll just get your palate warmed up here, literally. It's a thai coconut broth that's been made with all sorts of peppers. Sweet chili shrimp, sort of a chinese chicken salad. - Looks amazing. - Thank you so much. - Oh, the flavors are just popping. - Super nice. - I'll probably need the chair set up to go and investigate what's going on there. - Yeah, yeah. - So whenever you guys are ready, let me know, and we'll coordinate with the chair. - What's happening? - Pipe just burst. - God. So there's literally just thick oil all over everything. - That's-- - I'm telling you, it's those crows we saw this morning. [ caw ] [ whistling ] - madison, madison, jenna, can you come help me clear, please? - Yeah, copy. - She's a little windy. - Wow! [ whistling continues ] - thank you. - You're welcome. - It was really delicious. - Hi... You've seen many, many layers of my personality. - Yeah, you're like an onion. - Yeah. - Yeah. - That gonna make you cry? On that note... - Yeah, on that note. - I'll be thinking about you. - Je-sus christ. - That sounds great. - I wanna go on the bob. - Deck crew, deck crew, jenna. The guests are definitely discussing going into the water. - Copy. - I just don't know if it's safe for them to go swimming in this wind. - Get the tender set up, and bring them somewhere protected. - Yeah. So I've spoken with the captain. - Yes. - And I think swimming right here is probably not the best idea. - Okay. - Because of the current and the amount of wind we've got. So we can take you guys to, like, a little secluded bay, maybe a bit closer in to the beach. - That'd be nice. - Got it? - Okay, I'm not gonna do that sea bob. I'll let the young guys do that. - Okay, here we go. There you go. - Madison, glenn. Can you go with these guys? - Copy that. - Right here, right here. - Yeah. - Have fun! - It looks so good in here. - Woo-hoo! Every day is, like... - You and me both, kid. You and me both. - Life is so short. I don't like fighting, I don't like holding grudges. I do not wanna waste any time being unhappy. So I'm writing these little love notes. Hopefully he's gonna read them and we can go back to normal. - That was fun. - That was fun. - Tender, we are on our way back with guests. - We're good. - Copy that, thank you. - Okay. - Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. That looks really nice. - It will when I'm finished. - This is a series of love notes. - Yeah. - You can open approximately two per day until we're done this season. [bleep] you, adam. Coming up... I'm getting my confidence up. Taking the cake out in my underwear. I'm sh--ting myself. I'm actually shaking, wearing this, going out in front of these people. Do my cake proud. - Three, two, one... Stop. From an engineering perspective, heeling over to 27 degrees is not good for the machinery. When you're heeling over that far, a lot of sh-- breaks. A lot. - You see what it is, byron? - Yeah. - Talk to me. - It's a compression fitting on one of the hydraulic hoses. - Is what's up there fixable? - Yeah, totally fixable. Have you got a bucket? Thanks. - Mechanically, this isn't a big issue. The sail system still works fine. But cosmetically, this is a freaking nightmare. - Is it going into the bucket now? - Yeah. - He's fixed the problem, but he hasn't fixed the symptom. Now we've got oil all over the deck, all over the fly bridge. It's just a pain in the ass to clean up, and you need a lot of k2r to get it out. - Apparently, I have to serve the birthday cake. - Oh, yeah. - What do you mean, "oh, yeah?" why is everybody like, "oh, yeah?" you're the deckhand. - Yeah, but you're the hot piece of ass. - Um... - Do you mind if I go for my dinner and stuff? - I'll... I'll deal with byron. - Pretty slow, but it's still coming. - I hope you leave it up there for the night. - You've got guys working through the night, yeah? - Yeah, yeah. - My nieces, whenever they want something, they just go, "ama, ama". - That's what paget does when he wants boobs. - Oh, does he? - Oh, my god. - Fair enough. - There are some barriers that you need to not cross, which is your relationship with you guys being brother and... Like brother and sister. - We're not brother and sister. - Ah, well, I don't know. [ exhales ] - doesn't that look pretty? - Dino said bring these up and put them on the table? - Oh, that's pretty. - We're taking over, sorry. - No, do it. - A tiara. - These are really cute. - Oh, look at how cute the party favors are. - Paget. - Mm-hmm. - The other thing I'm gonna need you to do... - Mm-hmm. - Is take off your shirt for dessert, and deliver a cake with no shirt on. - I'm not a deckhand, I'm a first mate. I'm over this sh--. When I was younger in school I was a little bit chubby, and I was bullied for it. And I still feel there's maybe a part of that inside me. Like, as soon as I take my top off, I still feel really self-conscious, because I'm like oh [bleep] someone's gonna be like, "why are you doing that if you look like that?" - can't I work out a little bit before I go... - Sure. - ... And get a little bit of a pre-pump-up? - ♪ I'll make you love me ♪ ♪ if that's the last thing I do ♪ - no, continue. - Mm. - Mm. - Mm. - I'm just working my confidence up to the, um... Giving the cake out in my underwear. - What are you wearing? - Just gonna find something suitable to wear that doesn't show too much meat, and that covers enough sufficiently to leave enough to the imagination. - Um... - Um... - Moving on. [ laughs ] - you look rawr. - Rawr. - I like it. - We can go in two. - Okay. - Scuzi in the jacuzzi. - Are certain ones for certain people? - No. - No, go ahead. - That's for you, party princess. - You look beautiful. - All right, adam's ready for you. - Okay. - We're ready for him. - In celebration of kerry living her life to the fullest... - Fun! - Ah! - ...Tonight, I'm gonna pull out all the stops. - Yeah, you look cute. - I wanna make sure every minute of kerry's charter is absolutely perfect. - Yay! Bubbles! [ laughs ] [ cork pops ] - and more bubbles! - My favorite sound in the world. - Madison, madison, you can make your way down to the galley, please. - On my way. - Cheers, loves. - Okay, get these little ----ers and you can go. - Da-da-da! - Hello. - Beautiful. - Here you go. - Thank you. - So this is a roasted beet and goat cheese salad. Of course, the goat cheese is local. - Awesome. - Enjoy. - Thank you so much. Thank you. - Yep. - Mm. - How amazing is this cheese? - Yeah. - Oh, my god, the cheese melts in your mouth. - Yeah, well, they have a goat down there. - How... - Sauce, and we go... Go. [ whistling ] - here you go. - This is crispy-skinned branzino. - Oh, nice. - There's asparagus and cauliflower couscous. - Love it. - Okay? - Beautiful. - Thank you so much. - Mm... Mm-hmm. [ grunts ] - he's doing a really good job... - Mm. - ... Preparing everything on his own. - Paget? - Thank you... Whoa, what... - That's fine. He's going out to serve dessert. [ laughing ] - what? - Thank you very much. - This is how much food is left over, out of all those. - They can eat. - Yeah, man. - I like that. - Paget, are you ready? - Oh, yeah, sorry. - Ooh, yeah, looking good. - I'm sh--ting myself. It's bigger than people realize for me to go out and do that. I'm actually shaking, wearing this, going out in front of these people. - I'm actually shaking, wearing this. - Yeah, I mean, that's understandable. - Do my cake proud. - All for the tips. - Get it on video. - Okay, good. - How's everyone feeling? - I'm saving the best for last, are you kidding me? - I'll do some push-ups, man. - Ah-ha... Um... - You got this. Make sure to show your other cake, too. - All right? Should I go now? - Yes, you're the one serving the cake. - Go, go, you're serving it. That's the whole point. - Paget? - Have fun, bud. Knock 'em dead. [ humming fanfare ] - oh! [ cheering, laughter ] - woohoo! - Just what you wanted... A nice cake! - Thank you... Are you on the clock? - Uh, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah, I was-- enjoy the cake. - We did. - Yeah. - Oh, wait, one more cake... Can... I'm sorry... - Sorry... - Can you... Okay, thank you. - Yeah. - Yeah! - I'm just gonna cut the cake, and then afterwards, georgia's gonna sing for you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - I'm gonna go get changed. - Well, he's employee of the month. - Oh. - He went above and beyond. - That cake looks really nice. - Mm-hmm. - I feel like he's playing a game with me, and I hate it. - Send that. - We need to talk. - Thank you. - You're so welcome. - Mm. - Heavenly. - Very moist. - I'm proud of you, because I couldn't have done that. - Hope we get a nice tip. - I think we're gonna go inside. - Let's retire to the living room. - Georgia? Hey, can you cover service for me before you play? I've gotta go take care of something. - Okay. - I feel almost a little sick from too much food. - You wanna go somewhere? - Yeah. Fun, fun ----ing time. - Jenna requires a level of communication that I'm not used to. I don't wanna change, I want to do my work and focus on my life. Like, what is this bullsh--? Like, I don't... I don't have time for this right now. Is this about the fight we had? - Well, I think it's about a lot of things. - I don't like these ----ing conversations either, but I think we need to understand where we're both coming from in order to move forward. - I found it really odd that when we're finished being intimate, you go into a weird place and you always bring up a weird question. It's a big part of why we had the fight that we had. - I don't wanna have any conflict in front of anyone. - Well, here's my thing... I don't wanna ever have conflict. - I don't either. - So the fact that there's even any conflict is a problem to me. - Okay, so sure... - That scares me. - ...There is a problem. - And it makes me wanna run for the hills. - Okay, but here's the thing... You're not used to supporting a person in the way that is necessary for a relationship to grow. - I have to do a good job before I do anything else, period. So if I'm all buried into my emotions and trying to figure sh-- out, this isn't the time for that. And you know, that's probably why it's not a good time to get emotionally involved with anyone. - Yeah, I know, but... - So... - ...It ----ing happened. - There are a thousand ways we could have approached that. We took the wrong route. - Yay, georgia! - Hey, guys! - Thank you for playing. - Yay! [ clapping, cheering ] - brava! [ acoustic guitar playing ] - ♪ stretch out my hand under the sheets ♪ ♪ they are cold ♪ ♪ there ain't nobody to hold in my bed ♪ - all I wanted to do is get through this charter season. I wanna get the [bleep] off this boat. I hop in my van, and I drive away. [ exhales ] - ♪ ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ saturdays I am running ♪ [ crow caws ] - next, on "below deck sailing yacht"... - Can I ask you a personal question? - Yeah. - You and chris... What's going on? Do you seriously like him? - Knowing that my time with paget is coming to an end, this is kind of becoming torture for me. - Oh, come on... Lifting the seahawk, I can feel my back just go [ tocks tongue ]. I think I've thrown out my back. In yachting, there's no mercy when it comes to injuries. If you hurt yourself, you're off the boat. - I had a bit of a rough night. - I just got put on full service and laundry so jenna could go take a nap. - Interior, I think the service has dropped a little bit. Do you have a minute? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Let's go.
