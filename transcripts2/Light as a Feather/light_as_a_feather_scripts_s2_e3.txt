 Previously on Light as a Feather. The chrysalis doesn't just affect your body, it screws with your head. Do you hear what I'm saying, McKenna? I owe you. We'll figure it out. I... I promise. I'm here for you. What's going on? We're just celebrating Sammi's last day. Can I interest you in a tree? Maybe I can text you later? Text me. How the hell did you get out?

 Oh, McKenna didn't tell you? She did give you a heads-up about recanting her statement, though, right? If you won't tell me what's actually happening, - then I don't want... - This is my life, Trey! I don't owe you anything! You're right. So I'll give you space. Maybe it's best if we just take a break for now. Yeah, maybe it is. Hello? Are you okay? Oh, good morning, sunshine. - Where are you? - Uh... Someone hasn't calmed down from yesterday. I'm actually about to catch up

 on a month's worth of errands. By the way, can you send me your history notes from the past six weeks? I'm not in the mood. You're not holding up your end of the deal and it's getting worse. - What is? - Everything. The pain, the nightmares, these blackouts. Have you tried meditating? I can never tell if you're being serious. Yeah, it's my superpower. - Violet! - Okay, I'm sorry. Um, try a heating pad for the pain. It should take the edge off, but blackouts? I don't know. That's... that's a new one. You never blacked out? No, never. I swear. I keep waking up in these strange places, having no idea how I got there. Well, is your mom still tracking your phone? Maybe she could shed some light. No, I... I have to go. Hey, Trey. Is Alex home? What's wrong? You look ill. Do you need a banana or water or something? Um, no. Trey. Oh, God. Is everything okay? April. I'm just trying to be helpful. I am premed, you know. What's going on? I think McKenna and I are over. What? She said I was suffocating her or something, but I think it has something to do with Violet. Why did you get her out? Mack made me. She ambushed me and... she said some pretty mean things. - Why is she pushing us away? - It's what she does. When Jennie died, she ghosted for two years. Right. So if it's not Violet, it's me. What? No! This is not your fault. I'll try and talk to McKenna. I'll get to the bottom of it. - Emory! - Hey, Trey. - Yo! - Holy shit, it's Trey. - Oh... - Got your favorite, man. Beer! Not tonight. Dude, you holding? Uh, no. Sorry. - Have you seen... - Yeah. Heard you turned golden boy. Thanks for coming. So it's been a minute. I wasn't sure why you were reaching out. I thought I saw a ghost. I... I have this community service thing and there's this girl there and I thought... You thought you saw Jennie Brady. Exactly. Of course, then I remembered she had a twin and... - McKenna. - My God, the resemblance though. It's just... It's kind of how the whole twin thing works. Oh, right. Anyways, it made me think about you, and it just so happens that our guitarist bailed a couple weeks ago and... - And you want me to play. - Yeah. Oh, come on, dude, it's never been the same without you. Then maybe you shouldn't have kicked me out of the band. Uh, I didn't kick you out of the band. I broke up with you. Uh, why would I want to be in a band with someone who dumped me? That's a good point, but I should've just called bullshit on all those sappy love songs you were writing that were clearly not about me. Okay, yeah. Sorry. That was bad. Mm-hmm. I'm over it. So what do you say? Want to come by and jam? Ow. Okay. Fine. Jesus, McKenna. There you are. I've been so worried. It's almost 3:00 in the morning. Are you okay? Where were you? What are you talking about? If only you'd been there... It can't! You have to go big! - Okay, pivot! - Oh, wait. I'm trying. What do you think pivot means? Elf down. Wait. Hold up. Aren't you supposed to be a dancer? How'd you trip over your own feet? Yeah, well, I'm off the clock. Oh! Hmm. Okay, wait. So I thought we'd have a little picnic. Cutest picnic ever. Your place is great. Oh, thanks. Uh, so who's this? That's my brother. We don't really talk anymore. Um, messed up sibling drama? I'm very familiar with that. Hmm. Um, my older sister, she's like my parent's golden child. Oh, really? She an asshole to you? Thank you. No, it's more like a whole gaslight-and-destroy-my-spirit type thing. At least you guys still talk. I'm sorry, did I just, like... - No. - No, no, no. It's fine. Are you sure? Yeah, really. It's fine. Oh. Do you want some cheese? - Yeah. - Okay. - Thanks. - I forgot a knife. That's okay. McKenna! Come on, get up. It's almost noon. You slept in your clothes again? - It's noon? - Yes. Oh... - I must've... - Are you okay? This is not normal behavior, Mack, so I'm just gonna ask... Do you remember scaring the crap out of me in the hallway at 3:00 a. m.? I... Listen, you are going back to Dr. Schwartz, McKenna. Today. I had to tell her it was an emergency to get you in on a Sunday. No, I was probably just sleepwalking. It's fine. Listen, I know a dissociative state when I see one. Hey. Sweetheart, you've had so much loss. Jennie, Olivia, Candace. Your dad left, Henry's missing. You're not processing your grief. Please, I can't help if you don't let me. You can take my car. Leave a message for Dr. Schwartz. Dr. Schwartz, um, it's McKenna Brady. I know I was supposed to come in soon, but, um, I'm sick. I'm so sorry. I know that you made an exception this weekend, but, um, I have to go to the urgent care. Sorry. Hey, stranger. Violet? You're... Free as a bird. I've got to say, you're a hard one to track down, Mr. Salcedo. I made calls, texts, emails... Yeah, I've just been really busy. Christmas shopping? Me too. Oh, looks like you got a flat. Do you need to call home or something? I... my parents are out of town. Yeah, that's right. You had a rager, huh? I couldn't make it. You want a lift? Uh, yeah. I... I guess so. Isaac, I'm a little confused. About? Well, before you got sick, we were getting pretty close. At least I thought we were and now it's like you can barely look at me. What's going on? You really want to know? Of course. I've been telling everyone I'm all good, but I'm not. Ever since I woke up, I'm haunted by this giant hole in my memory and... all I know for sure is, you were the last person I was with. They say someone drugged me. Wait, and you think it's me? I don't... You make me nervous. Listen, Isaac, I feel weird too. The time last we were together, Candace was pissed at you for hanging with me. And now she's dead and... I really miss her too. You do remember that, right? Uh, I think so. I'm still here for you, Isaac, and I want to help you remember. Okay. Hey. Good job. Want some more? Did I get the time wrong? No. The other guys are just really unreliable. I miss your punctuality. It's one of your most attractive qualities. That and your mad music skills. Oh, come on. Tell me you don't miss band-ing with me. See, now this is the part where you would say something nice about me. I like your new hair. Really? That's all you got? And your... bird, pet thing. That's L. T. You named the bird Lieutenant? No, it stands for Little Trey. - You named it after me? - Yeah! I mean, he's cute, easily ruffled, and sometimes he flies off, but eventually he always comes back. - I think I'm offended. - I said he was cute. Okay, I get it. I was a dick the last time I saw you. Mmm, yeah, this is true, So let's make it up to each other. We, uh, got a gig Friday night. Come play with us. Come play with us. Come one, at least one song. I mean, we're trash. Come on! You're a garage band. You're supposed to be trash. I would just make it trash plus. What songs would we do? Whatever you want. You rusty? Let's find out. All right, listen up. They are pouring concrete today which means do not run down there and write your little names in as it dries. Pay attention to everything that's roped off. Safety first. Don't die, et cetera, et cetera. Get to work. Get to work! Sorry I didn't get back to you the other day. Shopping with my Nana kind of got away from me. No, it's okay. It's fine. Um, I was thinking, actually, about how she ended up in that coma, what happened to my mom and... what happened to your parents? My parents are dead. You know that. Well, no. I... I know. I'm just trying to find clues. You know, they died because of this thing. I already know the past. I'm more concerned about what comes next. You're Alex's sister, right? I am, and you're the one from the party? Yes. Peri. Um, we never got to officially meet. She's not with you, is she? Uh, no. She's working off her community service sentence. I'm sure she forgot to tell you. I mean, it is kind of embarrassing. You know, the whole breaking, entering, desecration, theft, assault thing? She mentioned it, actually. Really? And you're still in? Kudos to you. Hey, so your relationship with your sister is none of my business, but can I offer you some advice? - Actually, I... - Give her a break. Yeah, she screwed up. She's a good person. Maybe you should ease up. Please, you've... you've known her for, what? Ten minutes? And you certainly don't know me. But I know your type. Ms. Perfection. Right? Maybe you should let her lead her own life. And maybe you should stay away from her. Nah. But hey, I've got to get class started, so see you inside? Oh, man, this is some prodigal son shit right here! - You came! - And he brought his guitar. - Yup. - What's up? Wow. Let's go, uh, grab some Coors and let's jam? - All right. - Yeah. Do you even remember the last time we all played together? Got to be at least two years. ♪ ... inclined to be a part of the herd ♪ ♪ I feel from the get-go I wanna let go ♪ ♪ Jump down the bridge into the water ♪ It's... it's good to see you. I mean, come... come on! - This feels so right! Right? - Yeah, it... it does. - Uh, I, um... - Oh, sh... sorry. Sorry, it's just old... old habits and shit. - I get it. - No, it's fine. No, I mean, you probably totally have a girlfriend - or something and... - I... yes. I mean, I... I don't know. Uh, you don't know? Wow, lucky girl. No, I mean, I'm... I was with Jennie's sister. McKenzie? McKenna. That's who all those sappy songs were about? - Wow. - Yeah. Are you guys serious? I mean, I thought we were, but now I'm not so sure. Well, since you're wondering, I might have a little perspective on that. What do you mean? Okay, this is awkward. Um... my last day of community service, we all hung out, and we drank a bit and... she was there, and let's just say she didn't seem to be worried about kissing other dudes. I know what you're doing, you know. Paying my debt to society? I talked to Trey. You're pushing us away again. Um, I'm not gonna talk about this. Oh, I so hate you right now, but I'm not gonna let you do this! - Alex... - Hey... where the hell is my car? That was your car? Can... can you give us a minute? This is weird and gross. What happened that night? You straight up GTA'd my car. Which was after you punched me in the face, which was after you kissed me, by the way. So I... I really feel... Dude, where are you going? Hey, we're not done talking! - Hey, I said don't... - Stop! Holy shit. It was just like you said. Help! Oh, my gosh! Somebody call an ambulance! He's breathing. Hold on, I'm gonna... What happened? What's going on?
