 Last season on Light as a Feather. Have you ever played Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board? Light as a feather, stiff as a board. The slumber party game? Before we lifted each other, she told us a story about how each of us were gonna die. Olivia flew down the highway. By the time she saw the truck, it was too late. Trey told me what happened in that car. It was exactly the way she predicted it.

 Look, the game... it gets passed on from one person to the next like a curse. Five people play. Only one survives to play again. - What is that? - It looks like a cocoon. Candace was right. You're a psycho. I'll explain. If we know how she's supposed to die, we'd have something on her. We... we could get her to talk. Where is Henry Richmond? Honest. I don't know. He and Lena Regan are the only two people who know your death prediction, and now they're missing. I don't expect you to believe me. We both lost Jennie that night,

 but she's with us now, and she wants to make sure that we stay alive. How is she gonna do that? She's gonna play with us. McKenna and Jennie Brady shared everything, a birthday, a face, and even a soul. Can you help us? McKenna Brady could no longer live - without her sister Jennie. ‐ You're almost there. Stop saying that. You're gonna kill her. Sorry, Mack. Violet Simmons, keep your hands where I can see them. I've been wondering what this goes to. Actually, that's mine. I'll just hold on to it for you. Pinned down, helpless, immobile, the mounting pressure on his chest constricting his ability to breathe... And then, snap. Bone shards ripped through his lungs as the last of the oxygen escaped from his panicked lips. Chased by a warm, but bloody torrent, and as the final traces of life drained from the gentle, brown eyes of... Trey Emory. Are you okay, McKenna? You don't have to talk if you don't want to, but we are coming to the end of our session. $175 an hour makes for a pretty expensive silence, huh? I saw your bill. You were feeling so much better last week. What happened? Where do I even begin? I guess I'm just... overwhelmed. You're still grieving the loss of Olivia and Candace, not to mention nearly dying yourself. Healing takes time. What if I don't have time? Sorry. I guess I'm just... impatient. I understand. If you like, I can talk to your doctor - about upping your prescription. - No. No. Um, I'm... I'm actually wondering if my medication is part of the problem. I... I keep forgetting things. That's not a side effect I'm familiar with, - but again, I can talk to Doctor... ‐ No. I... I'm actually... I'm okay. Thank you. Dr. Schwartz, I wanna thank you for all of your help these past few weeks. You've made a lot of progress. Yeah. I've also decided today will be my last session. I'm sorry to hear that. May I ask why? I guess I just realized no matter what I do, nothing in my life will ever be normal again. Maybe if you give it more time. We've discussed your pattern of pushing people away. I've made my decision. I see. Well, trust me, McKenna. If you don't get my help, one way or another, you're gonna need it from someone else. I know. Nice outfit, little sister. April? Mom said you weren't coming till tomorrow. Nope. Finished my term paper early, so I came in last night. And you didn't say hi? Well, didn't wanna wake you. I figured you still needed recovery sleep after, you know, everything. I was so worried about you. Uh, thanks, but I'm fine now. Great, actually. Are you sure? Because your outfit's a little Keebler chic. It's for work. I'm... dancing in this holiday thing down town. So since I have you here, can you please explain to me what happened that night at the mausoleum? I mean that shit sounded insane. Didn't Mom tell you? Yeah, but her incessant crying... I just couldn't hear the details. Fine. SparkNotes version. Psycho bitch kidnaps girls, stuffs girl one in an empty crypt to die, before assaulting girl two with urn containing ashes of girl one's twin. Cops arrive. Psycho bitch arrested. Nosy sister minds her own business. Well, that was succinct. Shit. I'm gonna be late for spin class. I'll talk to you later. Love you. Love you too. Hey. How's the North Pole? Shitty and getting shittier. April's back from Stanford. Oh. Things still tense between you two, huh? Tense is a massive understatement. Well, it's only for the holidays. I know, but in the meantime, can I please come live with you? Guard Wilson, please report to the visitor center. Guard Wilson... Where are you? Um, I'm at the drug store, uh, just picking up something for my mom. Uh, hey, we're still on for Isaac's party tonight, right? Yeah, I will pick you up at 8:00. Cool, bye. McKenna Brady. I didn't think I'd see you again until the trial. Yeah. Me either. Looking forward to your testimony. I heard you and Alex have become pretty creative with the truth. And seeing how it's your word against mine. You know, But since I'm guessing you're not here But since I'm guessing you're not here to rub it in my face, what's up? Um... I guess I just have s... some questions. I've been thinking a lot about what you did, and... the terrible choices you said you had to make. I guess I'm just... I'm just trying to understand, um. Yeah? I don't... I don't really have anyone to... To what? Come on McKenna. You came all this way. Just say it. No. I shouldn't. I shouldn't be here. I've... I've made a mistake. Oh my God. You've got it, don't you? The chrysalis. I've gotta go. McKenna, wait. Excuse me. Hi. Sorry I'm late. You didn't go shopping without me, right? - You didn't finish it? ‐ Nah, just my grandparents. Fortunately, they're deeply into slippers. I got you something, too. ‐ Wait, really? ‐ Yep. No, I haven't gotten you anything yet. - Let me see. ‐ No, no no. ‐ Let me see. ‐ Not for another week. Fine. Oh, I talked to the detective assigned to Henry's missing persons case. Wait, really? Is there anything new? No. Just a few calls from people saying they swear they've seen him, but... so far it's all bullshit. You just keep hoping, you know. I mean, someone's gotta know something. Only one person to ask, and she won't tell. Yeah, well, Violet swears she doesn't know anything, so... How could you possibly know that? Um, well, with the DA, you know, they talked to the police and... seemed pretty convincing, so... She's a pretty good liar. Yeah, well, so am I. So is Alex. McKenna, come on. You and Alex told the cops exactly what you had to. Yeah, but it wasn't true. Most of it was. You know if you tried to tell the cops the specifics... They'd have us all locked up. Violet Simmons is exactly where she should be. I know. You're right. I'm sorry. Hey. Maybe I'll get you something in here. Come on. So I could totally hear it in his voice, you know? Tyler's back together with his old girlfriend. Bailey, come on. When are you gonna realize that you're better off without him? There, there, don't cry. Everything's gonna be okay. Really? Yeah. When have I been wrong? Never. God, what would I do without you, V.? You're a billion times better than the shrink they've got in here. Well, don't get too used to me. Why? Where are you going? Right, your trial's coming up. ‐ Four days. - You don't actually think you're gonna get off, do you, though? I mean, criminal assault, kidnapping... Um, sure, it's an uphill battle, but... Stranger things have happened. Can I help you? Uh, no thanks. I'm good. Well, I'm not. That's my purse. Please, there's no privacy between sisters. I'm just looking for my car keys. You mean my car keys? No, my car keys. If you recall, the car was my 16th birthday present. You're just using it while I'm away at college. Thanks for the reminder. No worries. Well, you should hurry. We need to leave by 7:00. We? What are you talking about? Isaac's party. I'm coming with you. Uh, no, you're not. It's a high school party. Don't you have anything better to do? I'm sorry, but, it seems a little pathetic. You know what's actually pathetic? Mom and dad are making me go, and do you know why? Because they don't trust you. Now finish getting ready. I don't want to be late. I swear, if someone told me two months ago that I'd be at a party with these people... We don't have to stay that long - if you don't want to. ‐ No, are you kidding? After everything we've been through, I'm just happy we're here together, even if it is at this stupid d‐bag party. Me too. Hey, I'm sorry, if I've been little weird. Um, sorry. Um... Who was it? It was just spam. Do you wanna get a drink? Sure. McKenna, I was hoping you'd make it. Hi. Hey. Troy, right? Sure, close enough. Um, I'm glad you're doing well. Yeah. I was pretty messed up. You know the doctors still don't know what happened. Do you know people were saying I OD'd? ‐ People are idiots. - Yeah, they are. Anyways, it's great to see you, Mack. Good to see you too. Are you okay? Yeah. Just a... just a head rush, I‐I'll see you guys later. That was weird, right? Are you okay? Um, uh, I'll be right back. ♪ I been chasing you ♪ ♪ I been going out my mind ♪ ♪ I been treating you ♪ Hey. Uh, I'm... I'm Peri. Oh, uh, hi. I'm, uh, Alex. It's nice to meet you, "um, Alex." Um, do you dance? Me? Yeah. Oh, yeah, all the time. In fact, I just started this advertising thing at Jolly Joe's Christmas trees. It's kind of cheesy, but... No, no, no. I meant, do you want to dance with me right now? Oh. Yeah, sure. Cool. There you are. Are you okay? - You just ran off. ‐ Yeah. Um, just needed to get some air. In a garage? Okay, fine. I just felt a little off, but, um, I'm better now. ‐ You sure? ‐ Mm‐hmm. Can't you tell? Come on. It's the holidays. Let's celebrate. What is in this? I don't know. It's blue. It's my favorite color. Since when do you drink? Um, since, right now. Ow. - Slow down. ‐ What if I don't want to? Oh, my God. McKenna, w‐w... McKenna? McKenna? Oh my God. McKenna! McKenna, what's wrong? What the hell do you want? Hello? Sounds like you're having a panic attack. That's perfectly normal. In fact, get used to it, because... the chrysalis doesn't just affect your body. It screws with your head. Do you hear what I'm saying, McKenna? ‐ Yes. - Good. I take it you started to see the butterflies already. That part is actually kind of cute. Just wait until your hair starts to fall out... teeth, nails, eyelashes. It's like you're the "Titanic" and your body parts are jumping ship, and make no mistake, McKenna, you are going down. I can't believe this is happening to me. And it starts to come for the ones you love. - Maybe your mom. ‐ Stop. What do you want from me? I wanna help you, McKenna. You know I can. That's why you came back. I gotta go. Shit. - ... Really nice. - Yeah, it does, right? So how do you know Isaac? Isaac? Oh shit. That's whose party this is, right? Yeah. Well, well, um, I busted. Actually, I crashed. - Wow. - Yeah. I was walking home from work and I heard the music, - and don't judge me. ‐ Hey, hey, no judgment here. Where do... where do you work? Oh, at the yoga studio down the street. - Oh, really? ‐ Started teaching a few classes since the semester's over. Where do you go to school? At Willow Falls Community College. Yep, but that's just until I save up some more money and I can go back to Berkeley. Yeah, how about you? ‐ Me? ‐ Yeah. ‐ Oh, I, um... I'm also working over the break. It's this Christmas tree thing. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You mentioned that. Yeah, but no, I meant, um, where do you go to college? Oh, I go to... ... uh, S‐Stanford. Stanford. Hmm. That's a good school. Yeah, it's okay, I guess. You guess? What? Okay, what's your major? There you are. Let's go. Kiddie time's over. - I have plans. ‐ April, kind of busy here. I could give you a ride home if you want. Um, not gonna happen. Our parents don't exactly trust her since she OD'd in homeroom. Homeroom? You're in high school? Um... Now Alex. Sorry. It was nice talking to you. Thank you. Hello? Mom. There you are. You wore that last night. Um, yeah. Must have been pretty tired. So you slept in Jennie's room? There's mud everywhere. Mack, what is going on? ‐ Um... - You know what? Let's just talk about this later, because right now, you and I have a much bigger problem. What are you talking about? Well... have you been to the juvenile detention center lately? Okay, look... I just got off the phone with the DA's office. Violet Simmons? Why would you possibly talk to that girl after everything that she's done? I... I can't talk about this right now. Yeah, well, you're gonna. I mean, this could jeopardize the whole case against Violet. - I mean, is that what you want? ‐ No, of course not. I just needed to talk to her. I had questions. There are things that you don't understand. Okay, well then explain yourself, please, because right now, you are really scaring me. My God, McKenna. She tried to kill you. I mean, this is unbelievable. - Shit. ‐ Here. Hand me that, please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let me just clean this up and I'll... Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom! Mom! They're blaming it on a fried extension cord. A freak accident. My mom almost died because of me. You're lucky she didn't. Yeah, this time, but what about the next? What if I'm not there to protect her? Honestly, you probably won't be. The butterflies, this thing on my back... I don't even remember how I got home last night. And now it's like everyone I love is slipping further and further away from me. I... I'm alone. No, you're not. If there's one person who understands what you're going through, it's me. And I know it looks hopeless, but there is a way out of this. McKenna, I believe that. I really do. Hey, look at me. We can beat this, you and me together. I can help. There's just one thing, though. I can't do it from in here.
