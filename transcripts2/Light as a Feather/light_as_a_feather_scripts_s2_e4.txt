 Previously, on Light as a Feather. The pain, the nightmares, these blackouts. - It's getting worse. - Blackouts? - That's a new one. - You never blacked out? - No, never. - This feels so right. - Right? - Yeah, it... it does. - I, um... - Sorry. This is Ridge, Luke, Nadia. We're actually going back to Ridge's lake house and maybe playing some games. Nope, sorry.

 Violet and I actually have someplace to be. You and Isaac were hooking up behind Olivia's back. She's crazy, and she killed Olivia! Stay away! You're insane! I'm haunted by this hole in my memory, and... I'm still here for you, Isaac, and I wanna help you remember. Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. - Alex... - Stay the hell away from me, both of you. Where the hell is my car? - Hey, I said just... - Stop! It was just like you said. Help!

 Speeding helplessly headlong towards his imminent fate with only mere seconds to ponder the recklessness that brought him to this point. And then, he felt it. The impossibly sharp point of a spear. He screamed in pain as metal ripped through flesh and viscera, penetrating the still-beating heart of Ridge Reyes. Light as a feather, stiff as a board. Light as a feather, stiff as a board. Light as a feather, stiff as a board. Light as a feather, stiff as a board. He's dying, he's dying, he's dead. He's dead. Holy shit. That was crazy. It was just like you said. I'm sorry, what? The way that guy died. It was, like, exactly the way you predicted it. The other night? "The other night?" Yeah, when you played that game with us. How could I have possibly played that game again? Did you know that this - was gonna happen? - No, no, of course not. No, just... just think. Try to remember what you did the last few nights. - I can't. - Why not? Because I just don't exactly remember. Because of the blackouts. This is impossible. I would never, - ever play that game. - Hey, just relax. Relax. Try to breathe, okay? The most important thing is that you don't talk to those other kids. Are you kidding me? No. Mac, if they find out, then they're gonna panic - and they're gonna tell everyone. - Please, just... just shut up. Mac, I'm trying to help you. Okay, well do me a favor and stop. Hey. What the hell? I saw you and McKenna talking after that kid Ridge died. - So what did you do? - What do you mean? I didn't do anything. I don't believe you. You said this was over. That we were free of the curse. - You are. - Really? Because there's no chance that that kid died in some weird, random way for no reason. This is about you. Okay, let me stop you right there. If you're suggesting that I had something to do with today, I have news for you. I'm retired. What happened to Ridge is exactly what it looked like. An accident. I don't know how you're doing this, but this is for sure all your fault. And at some point, everyone is going to figure that out. Why is it every time something horrible happens, everyone assumes it's me? Because it always is. I've lost McKenna. I'm done with you. - Thank you. - Yeah. Nadia, hi. Didn't know you worked here. Well, now you do. I'm... I'm McKenna, by the way. I don't think I ever... Yeah, we sorta covered that the other night. You left in quite a hurry this morning, McKenna. So, how did you know that guy was gonna die? Does it have something to do with that game? No, it has nothing to do with the game. - It was just an accident. - Really? That friend of yours didn't seem to think so. And the way you called it? I mean, come on. That shit was practically play-by-play. I don't remember. Oh. So, you don't remember what you said about me, then? That I'd get in a fight. Have my head bashed in. Honestly, no. But, um, maybe you could help me. How did we start playing that game? Um, all right. Well, you left the park and then you came back. We all went to that douchebag's lake house. - Ridge. - Yeah. I was gonna ghost, but he said his parents had a fully-stocked liquor cabinet, so... Did everyone go? No, it was just you, me, Ridge, that rocker chick, and that other guy. - I forget his name. - Well, think. - Who was it? - I don't know, some rando. - Was it Luke? - "Luke"? Yeah, that sounds right. It sounds right or it is right? Yo, chill, Nostradamus. I wasn't exactly there to make friends. I'm sorry, I'm just trying to piece things together. You remember how I said everyone else was gonna die? - No, I... I'm done here. - Wait, why? Because you're up to something, bitch. Listen, you need to tell me exactly what's going on or I'm gonna go find someone else to talk to. Like the cops. I'm sorry. Um, I just... I've never blacked out before... and I think I might have been roofied or something. I'm just kind of scared. Oh. I should go. McKenna! You're being straight with me, right? - 'Cause if you're not... - It's just a game, Nadia. That's it. I promise. Isaac. - Hey, what's up? - Hey. Hope I'm not interrupting or anything. No, I'm not... no. I was just thinking about your offer the other night. Just weird that I can't remember shit about what happened to me. Yeah, that's really messed up. I'm sorry. Maybe we can go over it again? You could jog my memory. You got a second? Yeah. Yeah, but I'm actually... I'm out running errands for my nana right now. I can come by, though. Yeah, that would be great. Okay, great. I'll be there in 15. Okay. I'm psyched to be playing again, even if it is just for one night. Yeah. Your set's never been the same since you left, so thanks for doing this. Yeah, no worries. Um... look, uh, about... about the other night... I'm sorry if I came in kind of hot with that kiss. - That wasn't cool. - You're fine. No, no, I shouldn't have. Look, I shouldn't have talked shit about your girlfriend. I mean, your... your ex-girlfriend. Whatever. Hey, let's just keep things about music, okay? - Cool? - Yeah. No, yeah, 100%. Um, I'm all about the music, yo. Wow, you got here fast. Yeah, sorry. Your mom let me in. - Should I... - No, I'm almost ready. Sit, chill. You know, we could have talked on the phone. I know, but I'm really happy to be here. I wanna help you remember. Cool, thanks. So you do remember... that day was pretty messed up? Unfortunately, yeah. Yeah. I was pretty freaked out after the Candace stuff, so you offered to walk me to my car. And, um... What? Well, you stayed with me for a little bit to make sure that I was okay. But then you needed to go check on Candace. But before you left... You kissed me. And you told me that no one was ever gonna hurt me again. That... can't be true. Why would you say that? Violet, if I kissed you, Violet, if I kissed you, I'm pretty sure I never would have forgotten it. I kind of saw... When did you become such an artist? I didn't. It's just something I started doing in the hospital. These are really good. Who are these people? I don't know. Just faces that come to me, I guess. Well, you definitely have talent. Hey, Brad and I are headed to Power Base and I need that pink cardigan I loaned you. Tell you what, you can have everything in my closet if you just kill me now. God, so dramatic. What's the catastrophe? College applications. I'm stuck on the essay. When's it due? Tonight. - At midnight. - Alex. Okay, fine. Come on. - Let's see what you've got so far. - No... That would be... zilch. Oh, come on. You can do it. Unless something else is bothering you. Fine. McKenna and I aren't speaking and... and I may have made a move on this girl I started seeing, and it turns out it was the wrong one. You mean Peri from the party. I saw her at yoga. - Did you talk to her? - Uh... Were you rude to her? "Rude" is such a subjective term. I mean, to be honest, I'm really not a big fan of her. Wow, you are unbelievable. But, of course, I shouldn't be surprised that someone who actually likes me wouldn't meet your approval. What can I say? High standards are the cornerstone to success. You know, that should be your theme. Do me a favor. Stop screwing up my life. Actually, Al, you are doing that all on your own. Good luck with that essay. Excuse me? Hi, I'm looking for Sammi Karras. McKenna? What are you doing here? Hi. Um, I'm sorry. You're playing here again? With my old band. I told you about them, remember? Bit of Decay, right. Wait, that was with... Sammi. That's Sammi. Your ex-girlfriend. Um, are you guys together? I... I'm sorry, let me get this straight: you're giving me grief for playing music with a friend? This, after you're supposedly making out with some random at a party a few nights ago? Who told you that? Was it her? Only matters if it's not true. Is it? Um... There's my answer. Why do you care? - We're not together anymore. - Exactly. Which is why I'm still trying to figure out what you're doing here. Yeah. Now that you mention it, so am I. Whoa! ♪ We watch ♪ ♪ Ouija board, spirit talk ♪ ♪ We creep ♪ ♪ Through the graveyard, we don't care ♪ ♪ Freeze our hearts with a stare ♪ ♪ Hold on tight, we're almost there ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Kill all the lights ♪ ♪ Swing on the heavy chains ♪ ♪ No fear when darkness breathes ♪ ♪ New time for freaky nights ♪ ♪ Kill all the lights ♪ ♪ Cat got your tongue? Like you saw a ghost ♪ ♪ Cat got your tongue? ♪ ♪ Now you're a bag of bones ♪ _ _ _ Are you kidding me right now? We need to talk. Okay, this isn't too creepy. What do you want? I saw those photos of you and all your friends on McKenna's Insta. Even the dead ones. Candace and Olivia. What's your point? Well, McKenna's being shady, so you wanna tell me exactly how two healthy members of your squad suddenly die within two weeks of each other? I don't know. Life sucks. Terrible things happen. - Look, I... - Don't bullshit me! I played the game, and today I almost got my head bashed in. Exactly like that girl predicted. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. You played Light as a Feather with Violet? Who's Violet? No, I played with your friend, McKenna. Tell me the truth. Am I in danger? - Let go of me. - Tell me now! Hey, a little help here? This isn't over. Gone for a week. Try not to burn the house down or OD on something. I need your car. I have a four-hour drive in front of me, so no. - What's wrong? - I can't tell you why, but I need your car now. Can you please just trust me on this? Is this about your college apps? No, this is way more important! More important than getting into a good school? April, stop! I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I can't tell you why, but I am asking you as your sister. Just please put all the crap between us aside and... be there for me. Okay, okay. Okay, fine. Go. Thank you. God, I'm still so pumped. It's like being up there onstage gave me a shot of adrenaline or something. It was pretty sick. I guess I didn't realize how much I missed it. Hmm. You know, I'm... I'm sorry I didn't reach out after we broke up. It's cool. I mean, I'm not sure I would have reached back. Kinda had a lot going on too. But, you know, today is a new day. Yes, it is. That was the best time I've had in a while. Thanks, Sammi. You know... maybe we could go back to the way things used to be. I mean, maybe we could make you being back in the band a steady thing. Hey, I promise to keep it 100% about the music. Cross my heart, hope to die. This is Violet. Leave a message after this. You were right. So if you wanna gloat about it, then fine. Go right ahead. I should have never talked to Nadia. I shouldn't have talked to any of them. It was a dumb idea to think that I could do this myself. Everything is a million times worse. You said that this would happen. That the curse would rob me of my energy and my hope. It has taken every single thing that I care about in this world, and I'm completely... I'm completely... You played again? McKenna. McKenna. Is it true? Oh, my God. Are you all right? Not really. It's okay. We got through this once before. We'll do it again. I wish I could believe that. It's gonna be okay. I promise. I'm... I'm sorry. _ Is everything okay? Somehow, yes. Alex, what am I gonna do? I'm not sure, but we're gonna figure it out together. Sometimes, you have to trust that the people who really love you are going to have your back. And I've got yours. Come on.
