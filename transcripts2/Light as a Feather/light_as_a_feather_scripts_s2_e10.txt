 NARRATOR: Previously on Light as a Feather...  SYLVIA: I didn't know if it would work, but nobody died. That is all I know. We got it. Let's go. HENRY: McKenna! [BREATHING HEAVILY] VIOLET: When did you become such an artist? ISAAC: It's just something I started doing in the hospital. Who are these people? I don't know, just faces that come to me, I guess.

 Pain is better, haven't been sleepwalking. Playing the game in the factory like Sylvia said... Yeah, I think it worked. VIOLET: I've had a really shitty day, okay? Someone stole something really important from me. - I got into college today. - What? Before I make a decision, there's something I have to do first. ALEX: Oh, I see. Then I'm going with you to New York. [LAUGHS] He's not over McKenna. MCKENNA: Even when it's over, it's not over. It was in Violet's last moments that she realized

 the substance eating her alive was...  [SCREAMING] MCKENNA: Acid. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] ♪ ♪ DOCTOR: Ooh, okay, well, the good news is, it looks way worse than it is. What's your name, honey? Violet. DOCTOR: Well, Violet, you want to tell me what you did to get a chemical burn on New Year's Eve? VIOLET: [GASPING] Acid. It's acid. DOCTOR: Okay, don't worry. We've given you some morphine for that and another drug called Zofran to control any nausea. You should rest. You've had a tough night. [ETHEREAL MUSIC] ♪ ♪ Superficial burns and no sign of inhalation. As long as we keep her stable, she'll be fine. OFFICER: Her shower head was unscrewed and we found traces of lye inside. We think someone set it so that when she turned on the water... She'd be showering in acid? Why the hell would someone do that? OFFICER: She won't say. Maybe someone from her family will know. DOCTOR: She asked us not to call anyone and she's over 18, so... LENA: As it burned through her skin, Violet screamed as she realized she was being eaten alive by acid. [MONITOR BEEPING] [DISTORTED WHOOSHING] [CELL PHONE BEEPING] - Isaac. - ISAAC: McKenna, sorry. I... I know it's early. I... I would have called Violet, but we're not exactly, you know...  No, it's... it's fine, just where are you? - What's going on? - ISAAC: I'm not sure exactly. A couple days ago, I stopped drawing faces and I started drawing other stuff. MCKENNA: What kind of stuff? ISAAC: This church, the same one over and over again, so I did my searching and...  [OMINOUS MUSICAL TONE] MCKENNA: Oh, my God. - It's... - ISAAC: Yep, same church, as if I drew it from memory, but I've never seen this place in my life. Something's happening, Mack, something evil. I don't know what Violet did to me, but...  No, it's okay. You just need to come home, okay? - We'll figure this out. - ISAAC: No, I can't. I'm too close. If anything, you come to me. Damn it! - What's wrong? - ISAAC: Nothing. - I just stepped in a... ow! - [LOUD BUZZING] - MCKENNA: Isaac? - ISAAC: Ow, ow, damn it! - Isaac? - ISAAC: [SCREAMING] - [LOUD BUZZING] - Isaac, what is that noise? - ISAAC: Help! Help! Help! - MCKENNA: Isaac! [PHONE BEEPS] [SHUDDERS] [ETHEREAL MUSIC] ♪ ♪ [MONITOR BEEPING] NURSE: Dr. Crowley to Radiology. Dr. Crowley to Radiology. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Lena! [BREATHING HEAVILY] [WHIMPERS] [WHIMPERS] [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC] NURSE: Code green. ♪ ♪ [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [MYSTERIOUS MUSIC SWELLS] ♪ ♪ Lena? I knew that was you. What are you doing here? JEFF: There you are. Don't you know you're not supposed to be out here? NURSE: It's okay, Jeff. Lena hasn't spoken since she got here. Come on, Lena. Come back to your room. ♪ ♪ [DEVICE BEEPS] ♪ ♪ VIOLET: Lena, wait. ♪ ♪ [OMINOUS MUSIC] ♪ ♪ MCKENNA: [SIGHS] Officer, just as I said to the last person, Isaac didn't say where he was. OFFICER: Did you try his family? Yes, I've tried calling his house, but no one's answering. Maybe you could track his phone? OFFICER: Ma'am, we would need a warrant. Please, there's gotta be something you can do. OFFICER: Look, maybe we can. You can. OFFICER: We'll see what we can do. Thank you. [SIGHS] [PHONE BEEPING] [LINE TRILLING] ALEX: This is Alex. Leave a message and have a fantastic day. - [PHONE BEEPS] - Alex, something's happening. Call me when you can. SAMMI: Uh, I think Brooklyn's pretty pricey, but, uh, what about Queens? I'm fine with anywhere except Jersey. I heard that place smells. Oh, so it's good enough for the Misfits but it's not good enough for pretty boy Emory? Come on, it'll give you cred. I have Willow Falls cred. Words no one's ever said. [LAUGHS] - ALEX: How did you not know? - PERI: Because I didn't see. - Crap. - What? ALEX: Trey and Sammi are here. Maybe we should go. No, no, no, no, or, or, hey, maybe we could invite them over. You know, that's kind of how these things work. ALEX: McKenna just told me she still has a thing for Trey. If we hang out with them, aren't we saying we're Team Sammi? No, I think we're saying we're Team Polite Human Being. SAMMI: [LAUGHS] Oh, too late. Be nice. [BIRDS CHIRPING] What are you doing here? MCKENNA: I'm sorry. Um... You're clearly busy, um, it's just, we played the game again like you said, and I think one of my friends may have died anyway. I can't tell my friends that they played this game for nothing, at least not until you tell me what we did wrong. SYLVIA: Sweetheart, I know what you're going through is hard. I've been there. I only have a few minutes. I'm leaving town for a bit, but why don't you come inside and we'll talk this through, okay? Okay, thank you. Let me just call my friends really quick. - [TASER ZAPPING] - Ugh! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] ♪ ♪ Thanks. VIOLET: Hi, Mrs. Brady. What are you doing here? VIOLET: Just a little mishap, but I'll survive. I figured I'd come say hey since I'm here and... I thought maybe you'd still be upset with me. "Upset" doesn't remotely do justice to how I feel about you. [ELEVATOR DINGS] Oh. I guess I just hoped since McKenna forgave me, you would too. I guess my daughter's a better person than I am. You need to stay away from both of us. [GASPS AND SCREAMS] DEB: Hey. Are you okay? Guess you and McKenna aren't as different as you think. [EERIE MUSIC] ♪ ♪ [OMINOUS MUSIC] ♪ ♪ [LOUD THUMP] [THUMPING] Hello? Oh, my God! [BREATHING HEAVILY] Henry? [DEVICE BEEPS] NURSE: Dr. Shore to room 402. Dr. Shore to room 402. VIOLET: So the nurse said that you haven't been talking here, but you were awfully chatty with me. You know what I remembered the other day? Do you remember at the Kenney School when Ms. Jeston banned hats? You remember that, right? Do you remember what Marc did? - He wore every hat he owned... - VIOLET: [LAUGHS] - LENA: 15 at once. - [LAUGHS] I still have a picture. I'd like to see that. Look, Lena, someone tried to kill me last night, and I think it's the same person who kidnapped you. Where were you? A woman took me. That's why my mom says I have to stay here. No one can know. They'll take me again. She's sure of it. Lena, you're Marc's sister. You know I would never let anything happen to you, right? I know. Like Henry. Like Henry? So you were with him. He's still alive? He helped me escape. From where? Come on, just think. Even the tiniest detail can help. We were in a house. There was a red rocking chair and a star on the door. Star on the door, okay. Is there anything else? I don't remember. I'm sorry. MCKENNA: [GASPING] Oh, my God. McKenna, how did you find me? I was trying to talk to Sylvia. Henry, please tell me you haven't been stuck in this crate the whole time. Shit, is that what this is? How did we get in here? I was kind of hoping you'd know that. HENRY: No, n... no idea. That woman's been keeping us in her house. She's so crazy, she... she probably drugged us. She watches us 24-7, and all she does is ask us questions about Violet. Wait, "us"? You... you mean you and Lena? HENRY: [THUMPS] Yeah, yeah, but Lena escaped... At least, I think she did. [BREATHING HEAVILY] You haven't seen her, have you? No. It's crazy. I don't even know how long I've been gone. Weeks, Henry. HENRY: [THUMPS] So much has happened. You have no idea. Who is this woman? Sylvia, Margaret, is that... is that who's been keeping you in here? [WHISPERS] I don't know her name. I was at the Regans' house and when I was leaving, this woman came up. Sorry to startle you. I was hoping to ask you some questions. I couldn't help but overhear a conversation you were having about a mutual acquaintance of ours, a Violet Simmons? I just want to know what you were talking about. HENRY: I started getting this really bad feeling about her. I think you better leave. Oh, no, just listen to me now, okay? - [CAR HORN HONKS] - [TASER ZAPPING] HENRY: But then that's kind of the last thing I remember. [TASER ZAPPING] Lena and I woke up in her attic, and we figured we wouldn't tell her Violet's death prediction or else she'd kill us, so we never talked to her. If she's been keeping you in her attic, what are we doing in here? [WHISPERS] I have no idea. PERI: I always wanted to visit Times Square. SAMMI: Yeah, me too. That's... uh, we're checking it out as soon as we get there. TREY: Yeah, Central Park, Empire State Building... Empire State Building. Aren't you always making fun of people who do touristy shit? PERI: [LAUGHS] Come on, Alex. The Empire State Building isn't touristy shit. I mean, that's history. Yeah, she's right. What about school? What if your credits don't transfer? Yeah, because that's keeping me up at night. You're really gonna drop out this close to graduation? PERI: I think what Alex is trying to say in her own very strange way is that she's excited for you guys. - Oh, really? - Yeah. 'Cause she's sounding a lot like the truancy police. Have you told McKenna any of this? I don't need McKenna's permission or yours to live my life. MCKENNA: We're running out of time. BOTH: [BREATHING HEAVILY] Sylvia tricked me into playing the game with Trey and Alex, and I have to warn them. HENRY: And we will. The good news is, whatever she's planning to do, she's gonna be back. That's the good news? As soon as she opens up the crate, I'll grab her and you'll run as fast as you can, okay? That's how I got Lena out. No, no, I'm not leaving you here. Shh. Do you hear that? Someone's coming. Play dead. [FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING] [CRATE THUMPS] BOTH: [SCREAMING] BOTH: [GROANING] SERVER: See you guys. Thank you. Was it just me or was that awkward? It wasn't you. Wow, thought you'd still be at home sleeping it off. Sleep's overrated. I have something to tell you, but... ALEX: No, say what you want, but Peri stays. You know what? No. Peri has to teach a yoga class in 45 minutes, so... - See you tonight? - Yeah. Okay. Paranoid much? VIOLET: I just checked myself out of the hospital so what do you think? If the acid had touched my face instead of my shoulder, - I would be dead. - Wait, acid? Yeah, someone's out to get me, Alex, and they know how I'm supposed to die. Doesn't make any sense. We lifted the curse. Well, I don't know, okay? I just need you to help me figure out who it is and I'll give you something in return. I have a lead on Henry. TREY: What? You know where Henry is? No, no, I... Violet... ALEX: Look, if there is someone after you, you need our help, so tell us what you know now. MCKENNA: [SOBBING] HENRY: Hey, it's okay. It's okay. We can bust out of here. [DIRT CLATTERS] - MCKENNA: Oh! - HENRY: Oh, shit. [WHIMPERING] No, no, we can't. [LOUD THUMPING] The game says that we're supposed to be buried alive. [SCREAMS] [SOBS] Sylvia's not trying to move us. She's trying to make sure we never get out of here. TREY: So you're saying Henry's being held hostage, but you don't know who has him or where. Why the hell should we believe you? Because it's the truth. How do you even know this? - Someone told me. - TREY: Who? I... I promised I wouldn't say. ALEX: [SCOFFS] All I know is that he's being held somewhere with a red rocking chair and a star on the door. Actually... I think I know where that is. Come on. HENRY: [THUMPS] You can't do this! [THUMPING] Let us out! Damn it! [GASPS] Come on. HENRY: [GASPING] The air, we're gonna run out of air. - Do you have a signal? - MCKENNA: No. And my phone's about to die. BOTH: [GASPING] MCKENNA: She's burying us. I just kept thinking about my parents. [GASPING] I can't let 'em lose two kids. Henry, I'm so sorry I brought you into this. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] It's not your fault. I just think we're almost out of time. [DIRT CLATTERING] No. We don't have a choice. [LOUD THUMP, DIRT CLATTERING] We have to get out of here. We have to. [SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] [COUGHING] VIOLET: Well, they were right about the rocking chair, and look. ALEX: I don't get it. Why would Henry be here? Last time we came here, Sylvia wanted nothing to do with us. Makes total sense if she's a kidnapper. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Damn it, McKenna's still not answering my text. That's weird, right? ALEX: Yeah. Wait, she left a voicemail. - [PHONE BEEPS] - MCKENNA: Alex, something's happening. Call me when you can. Guys, something's wrong. We need to hurry. [POUNDING ON DOOR] And that's our plan, pound the door until she comes out? SAMMI: If anybody's even here. VIOLET: Wait, look. Shit. That's Mack's earring. She has to be here somewhere. Let's check the back. [OMINOUS MUSIC] HENRY: [COUGHING] You need to calm down. HENRY: [GASPING] I can't. I fe... I feel... Henry, you need to breathe. Henry. Henry! [GASPING] Henry? HENRY: [GASPING] - [GASPING STOPS] - No. No. [WHISPERS] No. No. [CRYING] No. TREY: That's Mrs. Brady's car. ALEX: This makes no sense. Why would McKenna park back here? VIOLET: Well, maybe she didn't. Maybe somebody else did. SAMMI: Hey, hey, guys? Over here. Oh, no. MCKENNA: [GASPING] [CRYING] Hello? Hello? SAMMI: Wait, did you hear that? Sounds like McKenna. MCKENNA: [GASPS] [SCREAMS] Come on, hurry! MCKENNA: [SCREAMING] ALEX: Come on! [TENSE MUSIC] ♪ ♪ ALEX: Henry. Henry. ALL: [GASPING] ALEX: Are you okay? TREY: Thank God you're okay. Thank God. SAMMI: It's gonna be okay. What the hell happened to you guys? Henry said Sylvia started to move out after she met us, after she told us to play the game again. W... why? Why... why would she do that? TREY: Sylvia's been watching us for a long time. How'd you know Henry was here? I wasn't here for Henry. Isaac called. I watched him get attacked by wasps... [SHUDDERS] Just like his prediction. Is Isaac dead? I don't know. I can't be sure. TREY: Oh, my God. ALEX: So we played the game for nothing? We're all cursed again? MCKENNA: Sylvia lied to us. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] I'm so sorry. I messed up so bad. I messed up so bad. No, you didn't want to do this. I made you. [CRYING] ♪ ♪ Violet. ♪ ♪ I'm so sorry about Isaac. You should have told me.
