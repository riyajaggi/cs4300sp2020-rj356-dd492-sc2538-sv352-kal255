 NARRATOR: Previously on Light as a Feather. ‐ How could I have possibly played that game again? I just don't exactly remember. ‐ Because of the blackouts. ‐ I keep waking up in these strange places, having no idea how I got there. ‐ Well, is your mom still tracking your phone? ‐ That's L.T. It stands for Little Trey. ‐ You named it after me? SAMMI: Yeah. Maybe we could go back to the way things used to be. VIOLET: When did you become such an artist?

 ‐ It's just something I started doing in the hospital. ‐ Who are these people? ‐ I don't know. Just faces that come to me, I guess. ‐ So how did you know that guy was gonna die? Does it have something to do with that game? ‐ No, it has nothing to do with the game. ‐ You played Light as a Feather with Violet? ‐ Who's Violet? No, I played with your friend McKenna. This isn't over. [suspenseful music] ‐ Nadia Abrams always had a temper, but this time, it flared so bright,

 she couldn't even think straight. ‐ [screams angrily] ‐ She just wanted to get away‐‐ far away from this person she'd so quickly learned to hate. ‐ [panting] ‐ And in that brutal struggle... [glass shatters] That's when it happened. [objects clatter] ♪ ♪ In a flash... [eerie whoosh] ♪ ♪ The skull‐crushing impact that would end her life at the hand of her unexpected worst enemy. [blood trickles] Light as a feather, stiff as a board. GROUP: [together] Light as a feather, stiff as a board. Light as a feather, stiff as a board. [fading] Light as a feather, stiff as a board... MCKENNA: Oh, my God. I mean, I knew Violet's parents died, but from a gas leak on Christmas Eve? ‐ I can't believe you went there in the middle of the night. ‐ What? You think I can? According to my tracker, I haven't blacked out since, but... I mean, who knows when it'll happen again? Who knows what I'll do? ‐ Are you gonna be okay? I know your mom's working late. MCKENNA: Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Even if she wasn't, I don't need a babysitter. ‐ I know. I know. It's just, it's our first Christmas without Candace and Olivia, and... [inhales shakily] I worry. I love you. ‐ I love you too. ‐ What's that? [touching music] ♪ ♪ ‐ Oh, just something Violet gave me. ‐ "An upgrade." From what? ‐ My tracker. I mean, think about it: What's better than something that tells you where you've been? ‐ Something that shows you. [camera beeps softly] [mic rustling] [intriguing music] ♪ ♪ [crickets chirp] [mysterious music] ♪ ♪ [door clicks open softly] [objects rustling] [dark musical sting] ‐ What are you doing? ‐ [inhales sharply] What the hell is this? "House Fire Kills Teen"? "Local Girl Dies in Scooter Accident"? This whole thing is filled with this shit. What is it? Like, your trophy case? MCKENNA: Give it back. NADIA: Hell no! [both struggling and yelping] [dramatic music] [panting] [grunts] ‐ Ah! [both grunting] NADIA: [grunts] MCKENNA: [screams] NADIA: [panting] McKenna? [eerie music] McKenna! ♪ ♪ [ethereal music] ♪ ♪ ‐ [gasps, exhales] [breathes shakily] [winces] [unnerving music] [whispering] Oh, no. Oh... ♪ ♪ ‐ I don't think you're allowed to write in that until we buy it. ‐ Shh. I'm drawing your portrait. You're not the only artist here, you know. ‐ Oh, yeah? Let me see. ‐ Okay, fine. ISAAC: [laughing] Okay. VIOLET: See? Perfect likeness. ‐ Yeah, that's good. BOTH: [laugh] ‐ Oh, wow. Check it out. ‐ Whoa. $150? Who spends that on a notebook? ‐ Me. It's a gift. ISAAC: Oh, yeah. It's Christmas Eve. Kind of snuck up on me, with everything happening. ‐ Just think of it as a regular gift. I don't really do Christmas. ‐ You don't do Christmas? [cell phone ringing] [intriguing music] ‐ I ended up falling around here, but I don't remember anything else. ALEX: And there's no sign of the camera. ‐ For the record, I hate to say "I told you so," but... ‐ Violet, what do we do now? ‐ Whoa. Since when do we ask for her opinion? In fact, what is she even doing here? ‐ No. Nadia wouldn't have known anything was wrong if I had left her alone like Violet said. She knows how to handle this. ‐ Thank you. Now stop talking about me like I'm not here. What happened? ‐ The last thing I remember, I hit my head and I fell on the floor, but then I woke up in bed and the camera in my pocket was gone. ‐ Do you think Nadia took it? ‐ And how'd you get back in bed? ‐ I don't know. Without the camera, I have nothing to go on. ‐ Okay, so if we wanna find out what happened, we're gonna have to talk to Nadia. ‐ You want me to talk to the girl who just brutally attacked me? ‐ We can't exactly call the cops, and we're definitely not giving her another chance to hurt you. Oh, God. ‐ What? ‐ [inhales] I just agreed with Violet. [mysterious music] [door buzzer sounds] Are you sure this is Nadia's address? ‐ Yeah, I got it off the community service contact sheet. ♪ ♪ [dramatic musical sting] ‐ Nadia! Oh, my God! [gasps] VIOLET: Oh, God. ALEX: Holy shit. Nadia, no! VIOLET: How could this happen? ‐ Oh, my God. ALEX: No, stop‐‐ VIOLET: Mack, no. ‐ No! We have to do something! ‐ It's too late. Trust me. ♪ ♪ [object crunches] ALEX: What are you doing? ♪ ♪ ‐ This is my camera. What is it doing here? ‐ Better question: if it was on you, how did you get here? [car door slams shut] ♪ ♪ Oh, shit. There's someone coming. We gotta go. ‐ Wait. Leave? Are you kidding me? ‐ What? Would you rather stay here? Hang out with the cops? ‐ Okay. Fine. You're right. Let's go. ‐ Ugh, damn it. It won't play. ‐ Are you sure it's yours? ‐ Yeah, it's definitely mine, and I was definitely wearing it. So either I was here when Nadia was killed or‐‐ ‐ No. It's not possible, okay? She probably took it off of you after she attacked you. ‐ Or it fell as I was climbing out her window. Nadia said she was predicted to die after a fight, and look what happened. ‐ McKenna, this is what I've been trying to tell you. The curse makes you do things that you never thought you could. ‐ No! It's impossible, okay? We'll just get the camera fixed, and you'll see it wasn't you. ‐ No, we're gonna have to do that later. I still feel weird about leaving Nadia. VIOLET: Mack, there's nothing we can do. ‐ We can warn Luke and Sammi before it's too late. ‐ If you do that, it'll just be Nadia all over again. ‐ No, if we tell them how they're supposed to die, they can avoid it until we beat this thing. That's what we did. [long pause] ‐ Okay, fine. You talk to Sammi. I'll try to find Luke. ‐ Okay. ‐ 252 Greenacre Avenue. Luke Chiba, right? There's only one Luke Chiba in Willow Falls. Let's go. ‐ Wait! Just let me do it. ‐ So you can do something shady behind our backs? No way in hell. ‐ I need you to introduce me to Sammi. ‐ [scoffs] You're kidding, right? You actually want me to introduce you to the girl I'm seeing? ‐ Trey, I'm serious. This is important. ‐ How important? ‐ I played the game again. [eerie music] ‐ What? ♪ ♪ [musical sting] Oh, my God. Are you okay? ‐ I played the game, and two people are dead. ♪ ♪ And Sammi is in danger. ‐ Wait, you‐‐ you played with Sammi? Why? ‐ I don't know exactly. And I swear, I wanted to tell you... but the curse is supposed to kill people I care about. ♪ ♪ ‐ Wait. That's why you broke up with me? To protect me? You made yourself go through this all alone? ‐ I promise you, I will explain everything on the way, but Sammi is in danger, and we need to go now. ♪ ♪ ‐ I know that look. Heartbreak? ‐ Remember when I electrocuted you? Good times. Wait, wait, wait. This is it. ‐ What's wrong? ‐ Nothing. There's a light blinking on the camera. VIOLET: It's Luke. ‐ Hey. Don't I know you two? ‐ Um, this is gonna sound weird, but we need to ask about the game you played the other night. ‐ Light as a Feather. We know you played it at Ridge's lake house. ‐ Oh, yeah. I mean, I heard them talking about that slumber party shit, but I didn't play. ‐ You didn't? ‐ So who did? ‐ Uh, it was your friend McKenna, that chick Nadia, Ridge, punk girl, and then some dude in a red hoodie. ‐ [sighing] Do you know who it was? Someone from community service? ‐ I don't know. ♪ ♪ Look, I gotta go meet up with a friend. Sorry I couldn't be more help. ‐ Okay, if Luke didn't play, who did? ‐ I don't know. ‐ Why is that the answer to every question today? ‐ Maybe not all of them. [intriguing music] Let me see that camera. ♪ ♪ Okay, the light means it's connecting to Wi‐Fi, which means the footage should be uploading to the cloud. ♪ ♪ ‐ I have my laptop in your car. I know all of McKenna's passwords. VIOLET: Voilà. I mean, honestly, what did you guys do before me? ♪ ♪ ‐ [groans in frustration] [sighs] Ugh. ‐ [sighs] This is taking forever. Just let me. ‐ Yeah, right. ‐ What? After all this time, you don't trust me? ‐ You really want me to answer that? God, and to think, for a second, I actually felt sorry for you. ‐ What are you talking about? ‐ We read about it online, okay? We know all about the gas leak. About how your parents died on Christmas Eve. [stirring music] ‐ Oh, yeah. You know all about it? Like how I woke up and found them? ♪ ♪ Like I can still see my mom's dead eyes staring back at me? God, I feel so sorry for you and McKenna. You think you're so different, but you could wake up tomorrow morning and be just like me. Everyone you love could be gone, and you're all alone. ‐ Look, I'm sorry for what you went through. Really. But that's not why you're alone. Every chance you get, you manipulate and lie. That's why you're alone. [computer pings] ‐ Download's done. ‐ ...thing is filled with this shit. What is it? Like, your trophy case? MCKENNA: Give it back. NADIA: Hell no! [static hisses] VIOLET: What's wrong with the picture? ‐ The beating it took must have messed up the file. NADIA: McKenna? McKenna! McKenna! ‐ Okay, at least we'll see what happened after Nadia bailed. Oh, my God. She got up? [eerie music] Wait, where is she going? Is she leaving? [static hisses] ‐ McKenna really did black out. ‐ And she left the house. [door clicks open on video] SAMMI: That's insane. Okay? Either you guys are on bath salts or you're screwing with me. ‐ Look, I know it sounds ridiculous. ‐ Oh, what's ridiculous? That a middle school game I played is gonna kill me? [scoffs] Why would that be ridiculous? ‐ Sammi, Nadia and Ridge are dead. ‐ [chuckles] I take it back. You guys are way past bath salts. ‐ Hey, you need to listen, okay? ‐ Dude, what is your problem? ‐ Sammi, you need to take this seriously. ‐ I'm sorry; she's getting in my face, and you're defending her? ‐ I'm not defending anybody. ‐ [chuckles] Look, I don't get what your issue is, but it‐‐ MCKENNA: [gasping] ‐ Dude, seriously. What the hell? ‐ [panting] [crow caws, wings rustle] [static crackles] ‐ The picture just keeps getting worse. [static crackles] ‐ Oh, no. [static hisses] ‐ [groans] That's it? ‐ Okay, fine. So... [stammers] McKenna was there, but we don't know that she killed Nadia, do we? ‐ Yeah, but we don't know if she didn't either. ‐ I don't need a video to tell me that McKenna's innocent. ‐ Then what are you so worried about? ‐ I'm worried because if McKenna sees this, she'll blame herself even more. ‐ If she sees it. ‐ The cloud's synced with the camera. So if it's deleted here... it'll also be off the camera. She'll never know. [rustling paper sound effect] TREY: And then they found Nadia with her head bashed in. ‐ [exhales] So they... they all died in the exact way that she predicted. ‐ Yeah. ‐ [exhales] Th‐‐this is crazy. We should go to the cops. ‐ And say what? ‐ [exhales sharply] I don't‐‐I don't know. But w‐‐we‐‐ ‐ Listen. Listen. Nothing's gonna happen to you, okay? I won't let it. [crow screeches] [eerie music] ‐ No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What happened? L.T. L.T.! MCKENNA: I'm so sorry. NADIA: Don't touch me. [crying] Y‐‐you‐‐you did this. You‐‐you killed him.

They really cram it down your throat, don't they? ‐ Yeah. Look, I‐‐I‐‐I know you said you're not the biggest fan of the holidays, so... I got you this. It says "Eff Christmas." ‐ [laughs] [chuckles sadly] ‐ Hey, are you okay? ‐ Yeah, I'm... fine. Um... [silence] I don't talk about it much, but, um... my parents actually died a year ago tonight. ‐ Oh, my God. On Christmas Eve? ‐ I... I did everything I could to try to save them.

I mean, she could die because of me, and‐‐and‐‐and not just her‐‐ whoever was in that red hoodie. ‐ Mack, calm down. We'll figure it out, okay? MCKENNA: God, that camera must have really messed up. None of the footage saved. There's gotta be another way. ‐ [softly] Okay. Mack, listen to me. There is no way that you killed Nadia. ‐ How do you know that? ‐ Come on. You just spent all day trying to protect your ex‐boyfriend's new girlfriend. The girl who does that doesn't just go around murdering people. ‐ Yeah, but you heard what Violet said about the curse. ALEX: No. ‐ It changes people. ALEX: No. It doesn't matter if it's Sammi or me or your mom. You're always protecting everybody. You're one of the good guys, Mack. And the second you stop believing that, the curse wins. ‐ You're right. [Will Cookson's "Alone in the Dark"] [hopeful piano music] ♪ ♪ ‐ I hate to say it, but... Violet's right about one thing.
