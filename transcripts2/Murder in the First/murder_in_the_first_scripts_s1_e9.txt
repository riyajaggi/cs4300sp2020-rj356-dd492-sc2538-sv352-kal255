 Good evening.
 We're coming to you live tonight
in what is perhaps
 The most highly anticipated
interview of the year.
 For the first time since
 His stunning arrest
and subsequent acquittal,
 Erich maxwell blunt
speaks about his ordeal,
 His past,
and his future.
 Mr. Blunt, welcome.
 Thank you for having me,
larry.
 And, please,
call me erich.
 This makes me want to puke.
 It was just three days ago,
erich, when you were acquitted
 On all charges related to
the murder of cindy strauss.
 I thought we were here
to talk about
 Applsn's launch of holotech,
larry.
Shit. I'm -- I'm late.
 I'm sorry, guys. I -- I got to
meet hannah for drinks.
 It's going
to change the world.
 Eh, we got plenty of time to
discuss that new product launch.
 But first let's talk about
what's on everybody's mind.
 Tell us about this ordeal.
 What's it been like
to be in your shoes
 These last few months?
 [ sighs] it's been a trying
time, to say the least.
 But even
in the darkest moments,
 I never lost faith
in the process.
 We're lucky that we live
in a country
 Where the rule of law
prevails,
 Where we're judged
not by the prosecutor
 Or the district attorney
but by a jury of our peers --
 Regular, honest citizens.
 What were his exact words
to terry and hildy?
And I had the best team
in the world
 Representing me
led by warren daniels.
 "you were right.
I killed that dumb bitch."
so, in my heart
of hearts...
 I'm gonna go home now.
...I never doubted
that we would prevail.
 I'm gonna get drunk.
 I'm gonna poke my wife.
 Larry: How has it changed you,
erich?
Cheers.
 It's shown me who my
true friends are, as
well as my enemies.
 It's taught me
the value of honesty.
 But I think, more than
anything, that the trial
 Has made me grateful for all
the gifts that I have in life.
 I'd like to thank all my fans
from the bottom of my heart.
 Their support has meant
the world to me.
 I'm fortunate to have
 Some of the best engineers
and professionals in the world
 Working for me at applsn.
 But I can assure you, larry,
 That even during
the longest days of the trial,
 I never took my hands
off the wheel of the ship.
 You ran things at applsn
even during the trial?
 Absolutely.
I'm the founder of the company.
 And I believe strongly
that I'm the only person
 Who can truly lead applsn.
 Tell us about your relationship
with cindy strauss.
 [ sighs ]
 Cindy meant the world to me.
 Her death will be a tragedy
that lives with me forever.
 Are you angry at the
prosecution, the detectives?
 I'm disappointed,
absolutely.
 It's clear they hijacked
the justice system
 For their own political gain.
 Our city
deserves better.
 What's your opinion
of the d.A. Perez,
 The driving force behind
this whole prosecution?
 Well, from the moment
that I was arrested,
 Jackie perez made it clear
to all those around her
 She intended to ride
this trial
 All the way
to the governor's mansion.
 I need a drink.
 Let's go.
 [ scoffs ]
I'm supposed to meet my husband.
 Now, in a strange coincidence,
your biological father
 Was murdered only days
before your girlfriend.
 Wh-what was that like?
 Devastating.
 [ sighs ] surreal.
 Your father abandoned you when
you were just two years old.
 Is that correct?
 I was too young to even know
what had happened, larry.
 And anyways,
 For as long as I can remember,
I've always been alone.
 What happened
to your mother?
 She died of an overdose a few
days after I was abandoned.
 Have any memories of her?
 Sometimes I think I can remember
her touch,
 Her smile,
 The way she'd hold me tight
as a child
 And make me feel safe.
 But then I don't know
if those are real memories
 Or some kind
of psychological trickery
 I've conjured up
over the years
 To help me feel like
I'm less alone.
 Your mother's death has
affected you greatly.
 I wish I had the chance
to know her, to thank her.
 She was only 18
when I was born,
 And she went through a lot
just to give birth.
 [ sniffles ]
 I wish I could share my success
with her.
 I think she'd be proud.
 Oh, she'd be so proud.
Shut up.
 Do you blame your father
for your mother's death?
 I don't know enough
to blame anyone, larry.
 But I know she died from drugs
that she got from him.
 And I know that he was
the one who abandoned me.
 All right. That little prick
killed kevin neyers.
 We got to let it go. We can't
double down on a mistake.
 A mistake? What mistake?
We were right.
 We lost.
 We lost the strauss case,
but we can get him on neyers.
 Chris walton confessed
to that murder.
 No, but he's innocent.
And...And we're responsible.
 Terry, you're never gonna get
that genie back in the bottle.
 Yeah, but...I can try.
 All right, fine.
 If carter finds you sniffing
around blunt, though,
he's gonna lose his shit.
 It will be on me.
 All right.
 So, what if
walton didn't do it?
 Where are you gonna start?
 D-hop and franklin.
D-hop?
 Well, you know I obviously can't
get involved in that again.
 Not after the shooting.
 Management control
would crucify me.
I know. I know.
 I'll handle it,
and I will keep you informed.
 All right.
 Well, don't rush into anything,
okay?
 Sleep on it?
Yeah. Deal.
 Don't stay here too late.
 Peace.
 This trial has been one long
exercise in self-flagellation.
 [ car chirps ]
it's over.
 All we can do is lick our wounds
and move on.
 Yeah?
Well, start licking.
 [ elevator doors close ]
 Oh, my god.
 [ trolley bell dings ]
 You're full of crap.
You think
I'm full of crap?
 Yeah.
I'll bust your ass.
Watch me.
 Watch me.
Watch me, kid.
Cool it.
 Cool it.
I know where you --
 Hey, hey, hey.
Cool out. Cool out, yo.
 Your mother told me I might
find you around here.
 How come y'all
ain't at school?
 It hasn't started yet.
All right. Good.
 'cause I got to ask you
a couple more questions
 About that dude with
the, uh, with the bird tattoo.
 Remember him?
 Yeah.
'course we do.
 Dude who went to prison.
 Yeah,
thanks to you two.
We did good, huh?
 Just so you know,
 It's never good when
an innocent man goes to prison.
 Now, you lied
about who you said you saw
 In that building that night,
didn't you?
 We seem him in that building
all the time.
His name is chris walton.
 But you didn't see him
that night in that building
 At that killing,
did you?
 We didn't realize
he was gonna go to prison.
 Shut up, d-hop!
 No, you shut up,
franklin.
 I'm tired of lying
for you.
 Just grow up.
 So, then you didn't see
chris walton,
 The dude with the bird tattoo,
in that building that night?
 No.
You're gonna get us killed,
you know?
 Ain't nobody
getting killed.
 You don't have to worry
about that.
 I'm gonna protect you.
 I just need y'all to tell
the truth.
 All right?
You have my word.
 What happened?
 He put his gun
on our heads, man.
 First mine and then --
and then his.
 He cocked the trigger
like he was gonna kill us.
 He took us in to see
that dead man on his bed.
 He told us if we said anything
to anyone,
 He'd do the same thing
to us.
 He made us watch
the blood
 Run out of his head
down the wall.
 That's, uh...
 That's messed up.
 Yeah.
That's -- that's why we lied.
 What'd he look like?
 What kind of clothes was
he wearing?
 D-hop: It was dark.
 He looked kind of old.
 O-older than me?
 Um...I don't know.
 All right.
 You guys did good.
 Hildy: We can't rely on
these kids, terry.
 How many different stories
have they told us now?
 Terry:
I believe them.
 I mean, they were --
they were terrified.
 Look. Mark my words,
blunt is behind this.
 Whoever those kids saw,
blunt hired to kill neyers.
 Why? Why would blunt want
neyers killed?
 He barely knew the guy.
 I think neyers must have had
something big on blunt,
 Something that could not
get out.
 I think the only thing neyers
knew anything about was drugs.
Exactly.
 I mean,
who better to cop from
 Than someone
completely disconnected
 From your day-to-day life?
 But see then,
neyers flips,
 Blackmails blunt.
 Threatens to go public
right before blunt's ipo.
 The whole thing could have gone
off the rails.
 Blunt holds neyers responsible
for the death of his mother,
 So there's motive
right there.
 Well...It's a theory.
 [ scoffs ]
you got something better?
 All right.
 Let's say these kids all of
a sudden are telling the truth.
 Who's the old guy
who did the killing?
 Oh, when you're 12,
everybody's old.
 Okay. Well, we confirmed
that hertzberg and wilkerson
 And blunt were all in l.A.
The night of the murder. So --
 Whoever did this
was experienced.
 They had skill.
 You know,
at cindy's crime scene,
 The evidence was
all over the place.
 But at neyers',
it was clean.
 It was like this cat
knew exactly what he was doing.
 Whoever did this...Knew
what we look for.
 What, salter?
 The two of you have lost
your minds.
 All right.
Just verify your alibi then.
 Eight months ago
at 2:00 in the morning?
 Come on.
You know how this works.
Yeah, I know how it works.
 Am I being detained?
 The witnesses who fingered
walton came clean, all right?
 They admitted to lying.
 Then why did walton
take the deal?
 He didn't have a choice.
You do.
 If my mother wasn't
in her death bed down that hall,
 I'd kick your ass, terry.
 Just tell us
where you were.
 We'll get our of your hair.
Okay?
 This is not an investigation.
It's a vendetta.
 You think?
 Well, it's funny because when,
uh, the verdict came down,
 Erich blunt cornered us
on the way out
 And he told us
we were right.
 He told us
he murdered her.
 Bullshit.
 His exact words were,
"you were right. I
killed that dumb bitch."
 So you might want to
get in front of this
thing, captain salter.
 'cause when we nail him,
 He's gonna throw your ass
under the bus.
 I'll give you one question.
Make it good.
 Did you kill
kevin neyers?
 No.
 Did you help erich blunt
find somebody who could?
 No.
 Now we're done.
 Koto: We're talking about two
12-year-old copper thieves
 Who change their story more than
they change their clothes.
 Now, I don't care
what those kids said.
 The neyers case is history.
Understood?
 So we're just supposed to
let blunt walk?
 Even after what he told us?
Yes.
 That's exactly
what we're gonna do.
 Trust me, terry.
 I don't like this
any more than you do.
 But it's time
for this whole building
 To move on from erich blunt.
 Because if we don't,
we'll all be working security
 On the tourist ferry
to alcatraz.
 So this isn't coming from you,
right?
 It's coming
from above you?
 How the hell do you think
I heard about
 Your little stunt last night?
Huh?
 Jimmy salter told
david hertzberg
 Who went straight to the mayor
who was so pissed off
 He threatened to fire
the chief
 If he didn't get the two of you
under control.
 You're not on thin ice here,
you're through it,
 Treading water --
you especially.
 This is your last lifeline.
 If you don't grab it, this town
is gonna want you drowned.
 I know.
You don't have to say it.
 Koto's right.
 I should, uh, just let this go,
get over it.
 No, that's not
what I was gonna say.
 But if that's
how you feel...
 [ sighs ]
I feel like a chump, hildy.
 I feel like a sucker
for caring.
 Well, you're tired,
you know?
 We're all completely strung out
from that trial.
 I think we just need to give it
a few days.
 Everything's gonna get
back to normal.
 Normal means we're letting
this killer walk.
 Well, I don't know
what else we can do at
this point, you know?
 We talked to salter.
We've run out of names.
 What if it wasn't just a gun
for hire? What if...
 [ sighs ]
 What if the killer had
his own motives?
 Okay.
 But who else
other than blunt
 Would hate neyers enough
to want to see him dead?
 [ dog barking ]
 [ knock on door ]
 Inspector english.
 How are you doing, mrs. Harbach?
Is your husband home?
 [ television playing ]
oh, uh, mind the cord.
 Thank you.
Honey?
 Yeah?
It's inspector english.
 How you doing,
mr. Harbach?
 [ television shuts off ]
 Doc says being out
in the fresh air is good for me.
 I quit that chemo, I don't know,
a few months ago.
 Now it's just
a matter of time.
 I'm sorry, sir.
Don't be.
 I'm ready.
 I'm just worried about betty
here.
 Oh, don't worry about me,
james.
 We're gonna be just fine.
 She's in denial.
And I don't blame her.
 You ever watched somebody die
of cancer?
 Actually, I have, sir.
 My -- my wife.
 Oh.
 Well, then you know
what it's like.
 Sometimes I think
it's harder on the spouse
 Than it is on the patient.
 You know, I figured
that I was gonna see you again.
 But I thought it would be
before the trial, not after.
 I got to admit that,
uh...[scoffs] I'm glad you lost.
 We love our grandson.
 Other than my sister,
he's the only kin we have left.
I understand.
 I'm not here to talk about
that case, though.
 Actually, I'm here to tie up
a few loose ends
 Concerning the homicide
of kevin neyers.
 When erich blunt
would visit,
 Would you ever talk about
kevin neyers?
 Uh, his name was mentioned,
 But we didn't talk about him
much.
 Erich wanted to know
about his mother,
 What she was like
when she was a little girl,
 Young woman,
 Before she fell down
the rabbit hole.
 Do you remember
where you two were
 The night kevin neyers
was killed?
 Goodness.
 When was that, again?
 We were right here.
 Eight months ago.
You sure about that?
 Look at me.
 What are you getting at,
anyway?
 Do you own a gun,
mr. Harbach?
 No, I don't.
 Should I?
 When was the last time you saw
kevin neyers?
 I don't remember.
 We haven't seen him
since sarah's funeral
 Over 20 years ago.
Is that right?
 If she says so.
 After you met your grandson,
did he ever give you anything?
 Like what?
 Like money
or -- or a gun?
 Why don't you get off
my property, you asshole?
 James!
 No, go on.
Out.
 And don't come back
until you got a warrant, huh?
 What's gotten into you?
 Show the man
a little respect.
 Respect?
 He's accusing me of being
a murderer.
 Well, you said yourself you
wouldn't mind seeing him dead.
 And he is dead,
and I don't mind.
 But I didn't kill him.
 I may not be the best man
in the world,
 But I'm not a murderer.
 To do something like that,
to stoop that low...
 That'd make me
as bad as neyers,
 And I couldn't live
with myself.
 Now you get off of my property
before I lose my temper.
Yes, sir.
 H-he's on
a lot of medication.
 No need to apologize.
Thank you for your time.
 Mr. Harbach?
What?
 [ camera shutter clicks ]
 Okay.
I'll see myself out.
 [ scoffs ]
 [ sighs ]
I need a warrant.
 Well, we're not gonna get
a warrant.
 Apparently not.
 Thanks.
 It's just seeing him
there...Sick like that,
 Hooked up to the oxygen,
 Dying...
 It really messed
with my head.
 Well, I think
that's completely natural.
 I still think about her
every day.
 [ cellphones buzzing, ringing ]
 [ groans ]
 Yeah, this is english.
[ clears throat ]
 No problem.
She's right here.
 [ groans ]
 Okay. Pacific heights.
 Copy that.
We'll be right there.
 Louise.
 Hey, sweetie.
 I need you to get up, okay?
We got to go.
 I got to go to work.
Really?
 I'm sorry.
 I'm gonna grab
your toothbrush
 And stick it
in your overnight bag, okay?
 These murders
have got to stop.
 I know.
 Come here.
 Mm.
 [ police radio chatter ]
 Terry: Hey.
How come y'all aren't inside?
 Because this isn't
our murder.
 Hi. Hey. So, I'll take louise
over to mike's.
 How are you, sweetheart?
 I've been better.
Yeah.
 Hey, all right.
So, daddy's waiting for you.
 He's got your bed
all made up, okay?
 Okay.
All right.
Try to get some sleep.
 You're the best daughter
in the world.
 I love you, mom.
I love you, too.
 Good luck.
Thanks.
 All right, molky.
I owe you one.
 Thank you so much.
Get her home safe.
 No sweat. See you.
Bye, guys.
 Bye.
Terry: Bye, little one.
 All right. What are you talking
about, it's not your murder?
 I thought you guys were next up
in line.
 We were.
But koto passed over us.
 He wants you guys
on this one.
 Why?
Why do you think?
 [ police radio chatter ]
 Alieda ingalls, heir
to the packard cookie fortune.
 She and her husband were
active philanthropists
 And apparently
world-class drug addicts.
 They were arrested
in south london
 On possession charges
six months ago.
 According to her housekeeper,
 They'd disappear for months
on benders.
 Anyway, you'll want to talk
to the husband first.
 Hildy: Where is he?
Awol. No one's seen him
in over a week.
 I figured you two could use
a new case to dig into
 While you detox
from all things erich blunt.
 Her body's in there.
 I'll be back in a few hours
before you wrap up.
 Have fun.
 Thanks.
[ sighs ]
 Terry: How long's she been
in there?
 Couple of days,
maybe a week.
 She's got a couple of injuries
that look foreign
 But she's been underwater
a while.
 Makes it kind of tricky.
 Plenty of time for her lungs
to fill up.
 So, even if
she didn't drown,
 It's gonna look like
she drowned.
 Most likely.
We'll see.
 Okay.
 What's the latest?
 Narcotics everywhere,
cash stored in the walls.
 Enough food
for a nuclear winter.
 Where are english
and mulligan?
Bedroom.
 So, what do you think?
 Hildy: I think we need to find
this woman's husband.
 Where's your partner?
 Oh, he's out looking
for the victim's other family.
 He's working the case,
though.
 He's not out chasing blunt.
 The chief is
all over my ass, hildy.
 The chief or the d.A.?
 Excuse me? What the hell is that
supposed to mean?
 Nothing. Forget it.
No, no.
Hildy, tell me.
 I want to know
exactly what you're thinking.
 Can I speak freely,
lieutenant?
 You don't need
my permission.
 I just feel like lately
 It's hard to tell
where your loyalties lie.
 Are you a politician now
or are you still a cop?
 You visit more than
my lady.
 Well, then you need
a new lady.
 Pickings are kind of slim
around here.
 So, what's on the agenda
today?
 Well, I was hoping you could,
uh, help me connect the dots
 On -- on your relationship
with kevin neyers.
 Like what?
 Like when was the last time
you saw him?
 I guess it was earlier that day
before he was killed.
 It was quick.
We didn't talk.
 I just dropped off a package
for him.
 Was that the fentanyl?
 I'm not gonna be facing
any charges for this shit, am I?
 No, man.
 I'm the one who's trying
to get you out of here.
 Don't mess with me man.
 I-I don't need
false hope.
 I got you.
 Just, uh, tell me
about the fentanyl.
 Like, how much would he order?
Was it his drug of choice?
 No. No, neyers was
an old-school junkie
 Hooked on
mexican black tar.
 Then why do you think he wanted
the fentanyl?
 Maybe he had cancer.
 Or maybe he was ordering
for somebody else.
 More likely so given he had
the funds to pay for it.
 Neyers never had
any money.
 I mean, medical-grade opiates
aren't cheap.
 Anyway, I had to pay off a doc
at the v.A.
 He wanted his money
up front.
 And neyers had it?
 Surprisingly so.
 You never asked him
where he got it?
 [ chuckles ] green's green,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
 Let me ask you
one more thing.
 This cat look familiar
to you?
 No.
 Although it sure looks like
he could use some fentanyl.
 [ sighs ]
 [ school bell rings ]
 [ children laughing, talking ]
 D-hop!
 Man!
 [ chuckles ] relax.
Come here.
 [ sighs ]
I got to show you something,
okay?
 Take a look at this pic.
 You ever seen this guy
before?
 Come on.
You can tell me.
 N-no.
 Look.
You know I got your back, right?
 You know I'm not gonna let
anyone hurt you.
 You can trust me.
 Can you just look at the phone
one more time?
 Just tell me.
Have you ever seen this guy?
 That's him.
 He held a gun
to my head.
 That's him.
 Okay.
 Burnside: So, she didn't drown.
She overdosed.
 She just happened to die
in the tub,
 But death resulted
from respiratory depression
 And subsequent
cardiopulmonary arrest
 Consistent with
intravenous heroin abuse.
 You add that to the tox report
and standard stigmata --
 Recent puncture wounds,
adenopathy,
 Paraphernalia at the scene --
 All consistent
with an accidental o.D.
Hmm.
 But the cause for concern
 Is this constellation
of puncture wounds,
 Uh, in between
her shoulder blades.
 Now, they're consistent with
the needle tracks on her arms.
 They're the same size,
same shape,
 Same tissue damage, but --
 But she couldn't have
reached around and injected
herself in that spot.
 Right.
Yeah, that's very unlikely.
 Especially given the lack
of skin damage
 That you'd associate with,
uh, you know, wayward stabs.
 Mm-hmm.
 So maybe that's the place
where her husband injected her.
 Well, if you find him, that
would be the question I'd ask.
 Let me see.
 Where the hell are
molk and navarro?
 Out enjoying
their free time.
 Well, I got to say,
now you've got me thinking
 About nothing
but james harbach.
 Well, that's why koto gave us
this case -- to distract us.
 Well, it's not working.
 Talk to me.
All right.
 So, harbach befriends
kevin neyers,
 Says he forgives him
for everything that happened
 With his daughter.
All right.
 Says he's sick, has cancer,
he needs help.
 Neyers says, "fine.
Bring the money up front."
 And then he calls him
the day of delivery.
Right.
 Harbach drives into the city
to pick up the package.
 Mm-hmm.
Neyers lets him in.
 Harbach steps in,
looks him dead in the face --
and shoots him.
 Boom.
Yep.
 The only thing is
we're basing all this
 On the testimony of d-hop
and walton.
 Well, we got to follow
the money, right?
 Follow the money.
 Hey, boss.
Hey, man.
[ clears throat ]
 Just, uh, we're making
good progress here, actually.
 Everything's going good.
Headway here.
 Uh, let me see.
Neighbors two houses down
 Think they say mr. Ingalls
 Stumbling down the street
about two weeks ago.
 At the moment,
that's our last known contact.
 We canvassed the family
and the friends and, you know,
 Turns out everybody's
sort of written these two off
 As hopeless addicts.
 They would go on, you know,
benders for weeks at a time.
 Yeah. Family's tried
half a dozen interventions
 But, you know, when you're
an addict with money,
 The only way you can be stopped
is death or prison.
 Right. Which is exactly
why this guy's gonna turn up.
 I mean, rich guys don't really
last long on the lam, you know?
 He's eventually gonna use
the credit card and --
 Yeah.
Unless he migrates to bitcoin.
 What?
It could happen.
 It's possible.
 You didn't come here
to talk about
 The -- the ingalls case,
did you?
 When was the last time
you guys spoke
 To erich blunt's grandfather,
james harbach?
Why?
 Because he just killed himself,
bullet to the head.
 Officer: We found this
in his pocket.
 We ran the name
that he mentioned
 And found that the case
belonged to you guys.
 Anyway,
I figured you'd want
 To see the body
before we carted him off.
 Thank you.
 [ police radio chatter ]
 [ camera shutter clicks ]
 .357, antique.
 We'll let you handle
the ballistics.
 All right. Thanks.
 You book it.
We'll pick it up later.
 You got it.
Cool.
 What's the note say?
 It says he,
uh, swears he acted alone.
 Well, isn't that a prerequisite
for suicide?
 He's not talking
about the suicide.
 He's talking about
killing kevin neyers.
 I-I-it's his handwriting.
 Okay.
 Did he say anything to you
about any of this?
 [ sighs ]
 No.
 Did you know
he had a firearm?
 No.
 What about this morning?
 Was he acting differently
at all?
 [ voice breaking ] he said he
hadn't felt so good in months.
 He said he wanted to get
some fresh air.
 I should have been
with him.
 I could have stopped him.
 Is there anyone we can call
to come and be with you today?
 Like...Who?
 Friends or family?
 [ scoffs ]
 Our friends are all dead.
 And the only family I have left
is my sister.
 Well, you should call her.
 We'll stay with you
until she gets here.
 You'll be a while.
She lives in omaha.
 [ sighs ]
 You sure there's no other family
we can call?
 Uh...
 The only other family
I have left is erich blunt.
 [ sighs ]
 I understand.
 Don't be shy.
[ chuckles ]
 Just slide it in there,
nice and easy.
 Erich?
Sorry, we have a situation.
 Who the hell let you in,
leonard?
 I did.
 I just stopped by to say hello.
And goodbye.
 [ chuckles ]
sorry. What? What is this?
 I ran applsn during the trial,
erich, and I did it well.
 And it made me realize
that I'm ready to lead.
 [ scoffs ]
yeah, well, I'm sorry, ivana,
 But this is my company.
I'm the leader.
 Oh, as you should be.
But it's time for me to move on.
 We're starting
a new company, erich.
 Ivana is c.E.O.
[ scoffs ]
 Oh, no, you're not,
you backstabbing bitch.
 I'll blackball you
with every vc in town.
 It's too late.
We just closed a $20 million
seed round led by sf angels.
 I'm actually surprised you
haven't heard about it.
 I mean,
it's all over the blogs.
 You son of a bitch!
 What are you gonna do?
What are you --
erich!
 Erich, we could have just left
and notified you in writing,
 But I figured after
all we'd been through together,
 I owed you the respect
of telling you face to face.
 After you told the blogs?
Yeah, that's really respectful.
 Oh.
 I'm gonna destroy you.
 Relax, tough guy.
 You can handle a little
friendly competition, can't you?
 David, get salter.
 I want him to confiscate
their computers,
 Their phones,
everything.
 Don't let them leave here
 With one piece
of intellectual property.
 If you even think
about stealing my code --
 That's your move, erich.
Not ours.
 We already have
our own code...Right here.
 It's just business, erich.
 No hard feelings.
 Get out of my face,
you worthless whore.
 Ooh, classy.
 Take care of yourself,
erich.
 I'm sure
I'll see you around.
 Who's irrelevant now?
 File a lawsuit now.
 On what grounds?
 Figure it out!
 [ people gasp ]
 Oh, sh-- my phone.
I left it at the office.
 You all right?
Yeah.
 Why is the gate open?
 Oh.
I think edgar was fixing it.
 The lock was broken.
 What the hell, man?
 I need to talk to you.
 You're trespassing.
 Get off my property.
 James harbach is dead.
 Shot himself in the head.
 What?
 And he left a suicide note
saying he killed kevin neyers.
 Don't pretend
like you don't know.
 I have no idea
what you're talking about.
 You had your grandfather
kill your father.
 I know.
 Haven't put all the pieces
together yet, and I will.
 But when I do...
 I'm gonna get you.
 [ gate opens, closes ]
 [ laughter ]
 You okay?
 Yeah. Why?
 What'd you do
last night?
 Uh, nothing.
 Nothing?
Nothing. Oh.
 Could you read through this
write-up from yesterday, please?
 Sure.
 Daniels:
Inspector english.
 Uh, mr. Daniels,
what can I do for you?
 My client wishes
to turn himself in.
 Really?
 May I present
adrian ingalls,
 The widower
of alieda ingalls?
 Adrian: [ sighs ] the moment
I heard, I raced back to town.
 How do you do?
Good. Thank you.
 I'm terribly sorry
 For any difficulty you faced
in finding me.
 Sure, sure.
 Um, why don't we go somewhere
where we can speak privately?
 That won't be necessary.
This will only take a minute.
 Have you determined a window
for his wife's time of death?
 We have.
 And are you at liberty
to share it?
 We're not.
 I see.
 It's my understanding
that mrs. Ingalls
 Was last seen alive on the 7th.
Is that correct?
 No disrespect, mr. Daniels,
 But normally,
we ask the questions.
 Well, just think of this as
a refreshing change of pace.
 At this juncture,
we're simply here
 To confirm
mr. Ingalls' alibi.
 You found his wife's body
on the 17th,
 And you just confirmed that
she was still alive on the 7th.
 I have here
documentation
 That shows mr. Ingalls
checking himself
 Into the summit haven
rehabilitation facility
 In moab, utah, on the 1st
 And that he was under
24-hour in-patient surveillance
 From the 1st
until late last evening
 When I personally picked him up
to accompany him here.
 Hmm.
I believe
that should cover
 The t.O.D. Window
from the 7th to the 17th.
 Now, would you like to detain
the man or is he free to go?
 We will need to ask you
some questions about your wife.
 Which he would be
more than happy to answer.
 But unfortunately,
this isn't a good time.
 Yeah, I-I have an appointment
scheduled with a counselor.
 The, uh, outpatient program
I checked into.
 Uh, now that I'm back and sober,
it's really critical
 I get a strong support structure
in place.
 All right.
You're free to go.
 But we're gonna need
to speak with you soon, okay?
 Yeah, absolutely.
 I'll back later this afternoon
to reschedule.
 Do that.
 I'm sorry for your loss.
 Oh, uh, yeah.
Thank you.
 Good day, inspectors.
Good day.
 [ whistles ]
 What the hell
was that about?
 Koto: English, mulligan.
 [ sighs ]
 The ballistics
on harbach's gun came back.
 It's a match.
[ sighs ]
 It's the same gun used to kill
kevin neyers.
 You guys were right.
 Chris walton's innocent.
 Siletti's fast-tracking
his release
 With judge powell
as we speak.
 [ sighs ]
you guys got lucky on this one.
 Here's the thing.
 Uh, we think blunt paid harbach
to kill neyers.
 [ chuckles lightly ]
shakespearean.
 I like your imagination,
hildy.
 Terry: Oh, give her some credit,
lieutenant, all right?
 Just yesterday,
y-you were still convinced
 That walton was guilty.
 Okay, look.
 Do you have a single shred
of evidence
 Linking blunt to the murder?
 [ sighs ]
we're working on it.
 But I think we deserve a shot
to run with this thing.
 This isn't a democracy,
terry.
 I'm giving you guys
an order.
 Take your victory with walton
and move on.
 [ buzzer ]
 Walton, chris, cdc I.D.
1-1-2-2-1-4.
 Date of birth?
 January 30, 1976.
 [ keyboard clacking ]
 Woman: Congratulations.
You're free to go.
 Thought you might need
a ride.
 Thank you.
 Get in.
