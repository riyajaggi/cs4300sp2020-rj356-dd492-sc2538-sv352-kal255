indistinct conversations ]
 Mrs. Harbach.
 Hi. I'm jacqui.
I'm mr. Hertzberg's assistant.
 Oh, thank you
for meeting me.
 Of course. If you'll
just follow me this way.
 I-I was so sorry to hear
about grandpa's death.
 I-I'm still in shock.
 James had cancer, erich.
He was dying.
 I'm sure he was
just sick and tired
 Of being sick and tired.
 Yeah.
 Still, it must have been
quite the ordeal.
 My goodness, it was nothing
 Compared to what
you've been through.
 After we first met,
grandpa reached out to me.
 Were you aware?
 No.
 I think he wanted it
to be a surprise.
 He was waiting
for your birthday.
 W-what is this?
 It's a bank account
made in your name,
 Established
by your husband.
 David helped grandpa
set it up.
 He wanted to make sure
that you
 Were properly taken care of
after his death.
 But we don't have
any money.
 You do now.
Take a look.
 Half a million dollars?
 Thank you.
 [ gunshot ]
 Sammy's using
the water tub.
 [ gunshot ]
 So, this is our test bullet
 From the gun you found
on james harbach.
 This is the bullet
that was embedded
 In kevin neyers'
parietal bone.
 Same caliber, same lands,
same grooves, same gun.
 So you ran it
through clets?
 Twice.
The gun is clean.
 There's no record of its sale,
no listing in the database.
 It's ice-cold.
 As far as the federal government
is concerned, it doesn't exist.
 Hmm.
 It's the grips
that caught my eye.
 See that number in the corner
there? 1970?
 Let me see.
Yeah.
 1970. Four-inch .357.
 Now, is this the year
it was manufactured?
 That was my first instinct,
as well,
 But I ran the gun and the grips
against factory logs.
 They weren't manufactured
till '75.
 Yeah, my dad
had one of these.
 He used to scratch
his star number
 Into the grip
just like that.
 Oh, so that's not a year.
That's -- that's a star number?
 Yeah. But you said
this gun's cold, right?
 So, how would you get
an s.F.P.D. Weapon out
of the federal database?
 You wouldn't have to
if it was never in there.
 You see, when this gun
was issued,
 The s.F.P.D. Only registered
weapons internally.
 We didn't register with the feds
until the early '80s.
 [ telephone ringing ]
excuse me.
 Yeah.
 So it's got to be salter,
right?
 No, 1970 --
that's not salter.
 His number is 1900.
 How do you know that?
 He was my first sergeant
coming out of the academy.
 I had to write
his damn number down
 Every time I filled out a report
for like three years,
 So, unh-unh, I would know.
 1900 -- salter.
1970 -- that's navarro.
 Navarro: I got a beretta
as a rookie in '95,
 But after the recall was issued
a sig, just like you.
 Two guns. Both automatics.
That's it.
 Do you remember the last guy
who had your star?
 Howard...Something.
 Uh...I think he got fired.
 Howard toomey.
 Okay, yeah, he had it
from '76 to '96.
 Looks like he got it
from his dad.
 Steven toomey had star 1970
dating back to 1942.
 He made it to deputy
chief, ran the metro
division. Deceased.
 His son howard ran
the alcohol licensing unit,
 And you're right --
 Howard toomey was fired
in 1996 at age 49.
 Okay, so if he was 49
in '96, then...
 That means he's 67 now.
67.
 Didn't d-hop say that the guy
that killed kevin neyers
 Was kind of old?
Yeah, but, look,
 H-here's the problem --
according to the lab,
 Harbach definitely wrote
the note.
 I mean, it's his handwriting,
it's his pen,
 And james harbach's
suicide note says
 That he killed
kevin neyers.
 Did the lab find
any indents?
 Mm. Not that I'm aware of.
 All right,
maybe the note
 Wasn't the last thing
that harbach wrote.
 Hildy: Well, isn't analyzing
for indents
 Kind of
standard procedure?
 [ laughter ]
 There's nothing
really, uh, standard procedure
 About our
handwriting expert.
 Here we go.
Navarro:
Little miss molly.
 [ siren wails ]
 [ indistinct shouting ]
 Well, this is the address.
Looks like a halfway house.
 Sober living.
 Not every cop
lives happily ever after.
 Let's just hope
the guy's not drunk.
 Howard toomey?
 Depends.
 May I help you?
Yeah, uh,
 We just need to
speak with mr. Toomey
for a couple minutes.
 Absolutely.
 Gopher, why don't you
 Go help marcie
in the kitchen?
 Yeah, I drank like a fish
when I was a cop.
 My assignment didn't help.
 I ended up drinking myself
off the force.
 Back then,
that was no small feat.
 Everyone drank
all the time.
 And how long have you,
uh, worked here?
 As a counselor?
Yeah.
 Eight years.
 And you live here?
Five nights a week.
 I don't mind it, though.
 It's nice seeing guys
turn their life around.
 So, show me this gun.
 Okay,
as you can see there,
 The number's been scratched
on the inside handle.
 That's my number,
but that's not my gun.
 I was issued a six-inch
as a rookie, not a four-inch.
 Don't all rookies
get a four-inch?
 My dad was deputy chief.
 He pulled strings to make sure
I got the big gun.
 That six-inch .357 was
the only firearm I carried
 Until we switched
to automatics.
 So you don't think
there's any way
 That that could be
your dad's gun?
 Oh, no way.
He carried a colt .45.
 Any chance someone else
could have had the star number
 In between you
and your father?
 Come to think of it,
there was another guy.
 When dad retired, I had to
horse-trade him for the number,
 And he only had it
a couple of weeks.
 Please tell me
you remember his name.
 No.
 But I remember that he was
a real hotshot,
 And I remember that I had
 To give up this great number
for it.
 What was it?
 Uh...Oh! Turn of the century --
1900.
 That's salter.
 Jimmy salter.
That's the guy.
 So you stole the gun
from the department?
 How many guns do you have,
terry? Give me a break.
 Things were different
back then.
 The rangemaster was
a friend of mine.
 Everybody tried to keep
their guns.
 And you were
successful, right?
 So this is your .357? Yes?
 It used to be.
It's my rookie pistol.
 And now it turns up
as a murder weapon
 Used to kill
your boss' father.
 That's a hell
of a coincidence.
 I didn't say it was
a coincidence.
 I have no idea how it ended up
in james harbach's hands.
 I had nothing to do
with that.
 I got an idea who did.
 You're quitting?
What the hell? Why?
 Whatever happened to that gun
I gave you, erich?
 What gun?
 Come on.
That little four-inch .357.
 The gun that was used
to kill kevin neyers.
 You never gave me any gun.
 You're kidding, right?
 Jimmy,
are you wearing a wire?
 Would you do that to me?
Turn on me like that?
 I've been nothing
but good to you.
 It's been an adventure, erich.
That's for sure.
 Good luck, kid.
You're gonna need it.
 [ sighs ]
 [ horns honking ]
 [ bell dings ]
 All right,
so salter got the gun to blunt.
 Harbach used the gun
to kill neyers.
 So, at a minimum,
blunt is an accessory.
 Well, now when you've got
a four-year gap
 Between when salter gave him
the gun
 And when we found it
on harbach --
 I mean, even if blunt admits
he gave the gun to harbach,
 He could still claim it was
for home protection
 And that he knew nothing of the
old man's plans to kill neyers.
 I mean, individually,
every piece of evidence
 Could be explained away
by blunt.
 Well, everything
except the timing.
 I mean,
let's think about this.
 So, within a two-month span,
 Harbach meets blunt
for the first time,
 Ends up with blunt's gun,
 Kills blunt's
biological father
 Within a week
of applsn's I.P.O.
 Yeah, we just need more evidence
connecting those dots.
 Well, speak of the devil.
Here it comes.
 Hey, molly.
Huh. What do you got for us?
 He used a fountain pen,
so the imprints were settled.
 T-t-this one was clearest,
 Which means it
was probably written
 On the previous sheet
of paper.
 SeÃ±or.
 Excuse me.
Thanks, mol.
 Ah, "dear betty,
 "when you find this note,
call david hertzberg.
 "you can trust him.
He'll take care of you.
 I love you. James."
 The saga continues.
Right?
 Okay. Let's start
with mrs. Harbach.
 The moment we go to hertzberg,
we're going to blunt.
 All right, well, if betty
harbach's speaking to hertzberg,
 Anything we tell her
is gonna get back to him.
 Are we running this
by perez?
 We don't work for perez.
This is my call.
 Hey, mol. Ah.
 Uh, thank you,
miss molly.
 Betty: Oh, it's
just a security system.
 Terry: Well, I mean, you got
cameras, sensors, infrared.
 That's a pretty sophisticated
security system.
 I-I got the five-star electronic
home-bunker system.
 Top of the line.
 Looks expensive.
 Oh, they gave me
a good deal.
 I think
they felt sorry for me.
 I haven't lived alone
in 50 years.
 Can we come in? We just have
a couple questions for you.
 I-I-I-I'm sorry.
 I wish I could help you,
 But...My lawyer advised me
not to speak to the police.
 We know about the note,
mrs. Harbach --
 The one your husband left
instructing you to speak
with david hertzberg.
 Is he your lawyer?
 I-I-I'm sorry. I-I have
to close the door now.
 Okay. If you close
the door, we'll return
with a search warrant.
 [ sighs ]
 You can search
high and low.
 You won't find
anything in here
 Concerning any kind
of criminal activity.
 My husband would never put me
through that.
 Did you figure out
where he kept his revolver?
 No, I haven't.
 Like I said before,
I don't know where he got it,
 And I don't know
where he kept it.
 Well, he got it
from erich blunt.
 They warned me you might try
to do something like this,
 Get me to turn
on my grandson.
 Well, we're not trying
to do anything.
 We're just telling you
the facts.
 The gun they found
on your husband --
 The gun that killed
kevin neyers --
 Belonged to erich blunt.
 M-mr. Hertzberg told me
to call him
 In a situation
like this.
 Of course he did.
 His client gave your husband
a murder weapon.
 Why did your husband
want you
 To see mr. Hertzberg
after he died?
 [ sighs ]
 Because james left me
some money.
 Erich gave it to him to take
care of me after his death.
 Mr. Hertzberg set it up.
 When did they tell you?
 Day before yesterday.
 Did they tell you
how much money?
 Half a million dollars.
 They gave me this portfolio
with all the information.
 Thank you.
 [ clears throat ]
 Looks like this account
was set up back in may.
 Why would they have waited
so long to tell you about it?
 James wanted to surprise me.
That's what erich said.
 Did you spend any of it?
 Uh, $10,000
for the security system.
 I put it on the debit card.
 Well, there's another withdrawal
listed right here.
 Oh, the $1,300?
 I noticed that.
I don't know what that was for.
 The withdrawal was made
 Two days after the account
was first opened.
 That's a week before neyers
was killed.
 I'm not following.
 Do you know what,
um, fentanyl is?
 The pain medication?
Sure.
 It's the only thing that gave
james any relief toward the end.
 Terry!
 Hey, man.
 Thought you were trying to break
in to my pad for a second.
 Why? 'cause, uh --
'cause I'm black?
 No, 'cause you were rattling
on my window.
 [ chuckling ]
just playing with you, man.
 I'm just playing.
 That's a nice bike.
 Wait until I get
the engine fixed.
 It's a beast.
 Just hope it doesn't fall apart
on the highway.
 Where you off to?
Sacramento.
 Cool, cool.
 Gonna go visit your girl
or something?
 No, no, just family.
 I'm thinking of moving up there,
you know, starting over.
 My uncle's a foreman
at a battery factory.
 He got me a job interview.
 Look at you. Citizen walton.
All right.
 Yeah, thanks to you, I got
a second chance, you know.
 Doesn't happen every day.
 I ain't planning on wasting it,
you know?
 That's good.
 I got a favor
to ask of you.
 We're getting pretty close
on this neyers case.
 Wanted to ask you -- how much
did neyers give you
 For that bag of fentanyl
that you delivered
 The day he was killed?
 20 pops at 50,
 Plus a couple
of transdermal patches...
 $1,300.
 No shit.
 Cash up front.
 All right.
 My man.
Anytime.
 Chris.
 Take care of yourself.
 You, too, inspector.
 [ engine turns over ]
 [ bell dinging ]
 Koto: We need to update you on
the kevin neyers investigation.
 We're closing in
on an arrest.
 Well, unless you have proof,
you're wasting my time.
 We have blunt paying off harbach
and providing the gun.
 For what?
For killing neyers.
 Can blunt explain it
differently?
 Sure, but --
see, stop right there.
 When the answer to that question
is "no," come back to me.
 None of us wants
to get burned twice.
 But we have twice
as much on him here
 Than we did
in the cindy strauss case.
 And now we have something even
more important -- a pattern.
 Yes, we have -- a pattern
of arresting erich blunt.
 A pattern for murder.
 Perez: Not in the eyes
of the court.
 We lost that case.
Remember?
 Look, we were right then,
and we're right now.
 Erich blunt
killed kevin neyers.
 Siletti: Why does he want
this guy dead anyway?
 Who gives a shit?
He does. He hates him.
 He was blackmailing him
days before his I.P.O.
 Okay, so let's say
you're right, huh?
 He has motive,
and then he realizes,
 "why do it yourself
 When you can pay another guy
to do it for you?"
 But then you're saying he opts
against hiring a professional,
 Deciding instead
to roll the dice
 With a 72-year-old lung-cancer
patient from oakland
 Who he just met
a few weeks ago --
 A guy with no criminal record,
no experience, no gun.
 [ chuckles ]
that's erich blunt's
foolproof master plan?
 As opposed to your master plan
of being an asshole?
 [ laughs ]
I'm a lawyer, sweetheart.
 I get paid to be
an asshole.
 Great.
Jackie, come on.
 We've got more than enough
evidence to arrest this guy.
 I'm not interested in evidence.
I need proof.
 No alternate theories,
no other suspects,
 No slippery timelines,
no room for interpretation.
 I need 12 cameras
from 12 different angles --
 Undeniable, unassailable,
incontrovertible proof.
 The only way I am taking
erich blunt to trial again
 Is if we've already won.
 Thank you.
 Betty: Here. March 5th.
Erich blunt.
 That's the day
we first met.
 Okay. And you haven't seen him
since then?
 No, not till two days ago.
 Right, and your husband opened
up the account on may 23rd.
 Oh, see,
there's dollar signs.
 Oh, look at that.
 I thought
those dollar signs
 Meant we owed
the hospital money.
 But I didn't ask.
James kept our books.
 Now, would your husband go
to chemo by himself?
 Uh, yes, sometimes.
 I'm sure that's when he met
with erich.
 Okay, well, neyers was killed
around 2:00 a.M.,
 So don't you think
you would have heard
 Your husband get up and get out
of bed, leave the house?
 I take ambien to sleep.
 James could have led a marching
band through our bedroom.
 I wouldn't have noticed.
 Okay.
 Uh, I wanted to just ask you
about one other thing --
 This right here
on memorial day.
 What is that?
 Oh.
 A man came to the door
selling life insurance.
 Uh...James was out
of the house -- m.I.A.
 Okay, that's a week
before neyers' death.
Right.
 You know where your husband
went at that time?
 No, I don't.
Seems like
you were concerned
 'cause you underlined it
twice here.
 Well, y-you're right,
 But I wasn't concerned
about my husband's whereabouts.
 I was concerned
about the man on my porch.
 Who sells insurance door-to-door
on memorial day?
 Well, it's a good day
to find people at home.
 He said he'd researched
my husband's records
 And that he qualified
for a new gold-plated policy.
 James had already been diagnosed
with lung cancer.
 Did this insurance salesman
 Leave a card or a number
or anything like that?
 No.
 Soon as he heard james
wasn't home,
 He got in his shiny red
sports car and sped off.
 Yes.
 [ both panting ]
 [ computer beeps ]
 I'm gonna kill
whoever this is.
 Wilky. What the hell?
 I'm not done with you.
Wait upstairs.
 [ door closes ]
 Wilky, slow down.
You're spinning.
 Oh, you know,
I'm about to be charged
 As an accessory to murder.
 So I'm a little stressed,
yeah.
 What murder?
 Kevin neyers.
 The cops know about
the half-million dollars
 You gave
to james harbach.
 So what?
 Well, they also know that
you gave me salter's old gun
 To give to harbach two days
before he killed neyers.
 Jesus, man.
 And they're saying that you paid
your grandfather to kill him,
 And so now because I delivered
the gun to him,
 I'm an accomplice
in this murder.
 They're -- they're --
they're coming after us!
 First of all,
they don't know anything.
 They're just trying to scare you
into implicating me,
 Which you can't do because
I never gave you salter's gun.
 What?
Of course you did.
 How the hell
would I even have it
 If y-you hadn't
given it to me?
 You got it
from jimmy salter.
No, no, no, no, no.
 Don't -- don't you do this.
 You told me
that you wanted that gun
 For your grandfather
for home protection.
 You didn't tell me he was
gonna use it to kill a guy.
 [ sighs ]
 Take your clothes off.
 W-what? Why?
 Because you're
wearing a wire.
Oh, come on.
 Wilky,
take off your clothes.
 Do it.
 [ sighs ]
 Asshole.
 Those, too.
 You satisfied?
 I can't believe
you don't trust me
 After everything we've been
through together.
 You forgot to take off
your watch, wilky.
 You gave me this watch.
 I know,
and now I want it back.
 [ sighs ]
come on. This is nuts.
 Give me the watch, wilky.
 Oh, wilky.
 It's not what you think.
 Sure, it is. Look.
 It's a bug.
 [ grunts ]
 [ sighs ]
 You're pathetic.
 [ voice breaking ]
I had no choice!
 Wrong again, wilky!
 You chose to stab me
in the back,
 And after all I've done
for you.
 What exactly have you done
for me, erich?
 What?!
 Let's see.
You stole cindy from me.
 You sent my wife that video!
You destroyed my marriage!
 You've made me
an accomplice
 In a murder
that you bought and paid for.
 That's what you've done
for me!
 [ sighs ]
 Bill.
 Hey, bill.
 You're delusional.
You are.
 No, no, no, no.
[ sniffles ]
 We were ready to get the hell
out of here.
 We were gonna start
a new life together.
 [ sighs ]
we were.
 Well, then, it's a good thing
that I killed her
 'cause that would have been
a huge mistake.
 Cindy was carrying
your child.
 She was carrying
a fetus.
 I told her to get rid of it,
but she refused.
 [ scoffs ]
 Come on, I wasn't gonna have
a kid with cindy.
 That was never part
of the plan.
 So...
 I mean, so, what,
you just killed her?
 Look at it like this,
bill --
 2/3 of all human conceptions
 Are spontaneously aborted
by nature.
 10 million women die
every year in childbirth.
 I just nudged cindy towards
those probable outcomes.
 Right?
 [ chuckles ]
 It was sloppy,
but effective.
 Now, the way
that I killed my father --
 That was a work of art.
 You know?
 I made sure
all the evidence
 Was double-sided,
circumstantial.
 Salter gave me that gun
years ago for protection,
 And I gave it to you
to give to my grandfather
 Because, well, he lived
 In a shit house
in a shit neighborhood,
 And he -- he couldn't even
afford a lousy security system.
 And as for the money --
 His medical bills,
they just wiped him out.
 He was broke.
 I gave him the money
 So my grandmother wasn't thrown
out on the streets, penniless.
 Kevin neyers was a worm,
a virus,
 A glitch in the system.
 He had to be killed.
 So...
 You killed your lover,
 You killed your own child,
 Paid your grandfather
to kill your father,
 And then he took
the gun you gave him
 And turned it on himself.
 So...You killed them all.
 I didn't kill
my grandfather.
 That's not on me.
That was his choice.
 He was dying
of cancer, bill.
 He wanted to go out
on his own terms --
 One more final act
of defiance.
 [ scoffs ]
 If I was in his position,
 Doomed to a slow
and meaningless death,
 I'd do the same thing.
 [ chuckles ]
 Boy, you are...Insane.
 No.
I'm just evolved.
 Human life isn't as valuable
as you think it is, wilky.
 You know there
are seven billion people
 Walking around this planet?
 And we're growing exponentially
year by year.
 Humanity is on the vertical part
of the "s" curve.
 It's completely
unsustainable.
 We're gonna have to cull
the herd, pick the winners.
 People are gonna have to die
 For the rest of us
to survive.
 I'm just getting
a head start.
 Man: I'll give him a call,
thanks.
 [ indistinct shouting ]
 [ sighs ]
 Molk: Mr. Blunt.
 Hey, how you doing?
 Says he needs to talk
to hildy and terry.
 Yeah.
 Hildy,
someone here to see you.
 Found him
in the lobby.
 You're up early.
 Yeah, I, uh -- I learned some
information late last night
 About the death
of my father.
 I felt I should come in
first thing.
 Terry:
Mm. You beat us to it.
 We were, uh,
just gonna come see you.
 Would you mind
following us?
 Sure.
All right.
 Yeah, well, why would
salter and wilkerson
 Want to kill
kevin neyers?
Yeah.
 Well,
their entire net worth
 Was in applsn stock options
I'd given them.
 And according to bill,
when they learned
 That neyers
was blackmailing me
 And threatening
to derail the I.P.O.,
 They took matters
into their own hands.
 Why would wilkerson confess
all this to you?
 He was desperate.
 I mean, he's lost his marriage.
He's broke.
 I mean, come on, he was willing
to wear a bug
 Because he's so terrified
of going to prison.
 So, I told him
that he could keep his job,
 And I'd look after all
of his money and legal bills,
 But only if he told me
the truth.
 Are you done?
 I'm sorry.
 I'm just wondering
 How you expect us to believe
anything you say anymore.
 I'll take
a lie-detector test.
 Do you think you could get him
to confess again?
 You mean wear a wire?
Yeah.
 No. After last night,
I doubt that would work.
 Do you think wilkerson
and salter talk?
 Sure. Wouldn't surprise me.
 Hildy:
Hey, what do you think?
 You think we could get
a bug on salter?
 Salter?
 Blunt: I mean,
he's one of you.
 Wouldn't he, you know, smell
that coming a mile away?
 All right,
but what if it wasn't a bug?
 What if -- check this out.
I forget what page it is.
 There's an article in there, uh,
that talks about the n.S.A.
 Taking a regular smartphone
 And turning it
into a recording device,
 Uh, that you can use,
uh, by remote.
Uh-huh.
 Now, I'm not a techie
or a--
 But do you think that
that would be possible?
 Could we do that?
 Sure.
 Really?
Yeah. Why not?
 I mean, a phone is
just a computer, right?
Right.
 It can penetrated
just like any laptop.
 I mean,
all you'd need to do
 Is hack through the login
into the o.S.
 And drop a piece of n.S.A.
Malware into the system update.
 It's pretty simple.
 But wouldn't you need
a federal warrant?
 Oh, you mean...
 Something like this?
 [ clears throat ]
 [ sighs ]
 [ recorder beeps ]
 Blunt:
I just nudged cindy towards
those probable outcomes.
 [ chuckles ]
 It was sloppy,
but effective.
 Now, the way
that I killed my father --
 That was a work of art.
 [ recorder beeps ]
 Erich maxwell blunt,
 You're under arrest for
the murder of kevin neyers.
 Anything you say can
and will be used against you
 In a court of law.
 Get warren daniels
on the phone, now!
 You do have the right
to an attorney.
 If you can't afford
an attorney,
 One will be appointed
for you.
 Afford one?!
 I'm a billionaire.
 This is my house.
This is my game!
 [ grunts ]
 Game over.
 Woman: The san francisco
homicide unit,
 Led by lieutenant jim koto
 And inspectors english
and mulligan,
 Worked closely
with the medical examiner,
 C.S.I., and our crime lab...
 Man: Applsn stock
is in free fall since blunt's
stunning arrest this morning.
 Thank you, maggie.
 Shares currently trading
for less than a dollar
 As news of his taped confession
to two murders
 Puts the future of a--
[ remote clicks ]
 He wants to hire you.
 And I want to go on a date
with beyoncÃ©.
 Some things in life, david,
just aren't in the cards.
 The question is,
 Why are you still working
for this sociopath?
 Every man deserves a lawyer.
 No lawyer deserves him.
 Look,
if it's about money --
what money?
 He has no money.
 By the end of the day,
 The only thing he'll be c.E.O.
Of is his jail cell.
 You know the difference
between a c.E.O. And a criminal?
 Venture capital.
 [ chuckles ]
 You, my friend,
are living proof
 That inside of every cynic
is a disillusioned idealist.
 When we first met
in washington,
 Did you ever think
we'd end up here?
 Me, yes. You, no.
 You were chief counsel
 For the senate judiciary
committee at, what, 34?
Mm.
 I thought you'd end up
on the supreme court.
 [ chuckles ]
so did my mother.
 Justice daniels,
what happened?
 I discovered
I like money.
 [ chuckles ]
 You don't fly planes,
 Drive fancy cars,
take expensive vacations.
 What did you do
with it all?
 My money?
Oh, I keep it.
 Why?
 So I have it.
 So I can afford to say no
to men like erich blunt.
 I thought he was innocent.
I really did.
 I didn't,
not for a minute.
 He passed
a lie-detector test.
 He didn't pass
the lie-detector test.
 I just made that up.
 [ buzzer ]
 Is it true --
 What you said to bill,
 What they claim they have you
saying on tape?
 Of course not, david.
 First thing we should do
 Is file a motion
to throw this tape out.
 On what grounds?
 [ scoffs ]
 Illegal wiretap.
Whatever.
 Daniels will figure it out.
 Daniels is not taking
the case.
 [ scoffs ]
 Wait, what? Why?
 Why? Because you're broke,
erich.
 Your company is gone.
 Salter is gone.
Ivana is gone.
 Wilkerson is gone.
Daniels is gone.
 [ sighs ]
 Well, at least
I've still got you.
 No, you don't.
 I'm resigning...
As of right now.
 What?
 Just came in
to say goodbye.
 [ breathing heavily ]
 Why? Tell me why.
 I believed in you, erich.
 I believed in you.
 I don't anymore.
 [ buzzer ]
 We did good.
 Yeah. I guess.
 Uh, it feels weird to be
celebrating, though.
 [ sighs ]
why? We did our job.
 We were right.
 I know.
Just...That guy.
 I feel like...
 He's the closest thing
I've ever seen to pure evil.
 What he did is just not --
 Not human.
 [ sighs ]
 That's probably
what makes him human.
 What do you mean?
 [ sighs ]
 People like blunt -- evil --
 It's like a hunger,
you know,
 A hole that they need
to fill.
 I think it's their nature.
 They need it,
 Kind of like you and I --
 Like you and I need love.
 [ cellphone rings ]
 [ cellphone beeps ]
yeah?
 Oh, no.
 Blunt: [ echoing ] he wanted
to go out on his own terms --
 One more final act
of defiance.
 If I was in his position,
 Doomed to a slow
and meaningless death,
 I'd do the same thing.
