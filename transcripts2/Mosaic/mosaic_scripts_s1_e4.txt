 The state of Utah vs Eric Neill. The defendant has agreed to a change of plea, to the reduced charge of aggravated manslaughter. What could be the hand of Olivia Lake has been discovered a half-mile from her property. Why are you here now? I was wrong to think that you might not deserve this. I'm sorry! - No, no. You can't be here. - No. - Please! - All signs point to Eric. But in my gut, it just doesn't feel like Eric to me.

 - Ah! - Nate! Whoa, what the heck, man? Dude! Joel freaking Hurley. Here in Summit, Utah. Come here, man. - Come here. - Good to see you. Man, I never thought I'd see you here again. Well. And I'm gonna have to ask the two of you to step off this property, which is technically a crime scene. Which she should know, 'cause I've kind of, like, told her already three times. So, you guys know each other? Ah, more or less. Mostly less. But, yeah, if you... - Oh, hey! - Hey. It's all right, it's all right. It's just a nostalgia thing. You remember Joel Hurley. He used to live here. Looks familiar. - Alan Pape. How are you? - Good. I assume you folks saw the yellow tape bottom of the drive? We came, actually, the other way. Sorry about that. You were the detective in charge four years ago. - Do I know you? - No, we never met. So, guys, both of you, I need you off the property now. Yeah, I hate to be a hard-ass, but we got press crawling up out of the ground like worms. Folks up on the hill just trying to enjoy a modicum of privacy. - If you, uh... - Of course. Alan. Listen, don't worry about Alan. He's just doing his job. He knows where his bread is buttered. That doesn't mean it was smart to bring him up here. Joel, on a lighter note, you'll never guess who I literally just left to come up here. - Oh, yeah? - He's a Virgo, he hates long lines. He loves leisurely walks in the rain - and Italian cuisine. - Huh. Actually, I don't know if any of those are true. I don't even know if he's a Virgo. No fucking way! Frank! - Ahem. - Hey, Frank! Yeah! Okay. Ahem. - Hey, buddy! - Hey, no way! - No way. - Look at that beard. Look who I found trolling for hookers by the interchange. How you guys doing? You wanna sit down? - Heck, yeah, we're gonna sit. - Yeah, sit down. Just sitting by yourself? Yeah. - Oh, Frank, this is Petra. - Oh, we met a few days ago. She's been all over me about the night in question, the night we went to the movies... "Hobbit 2." Yeah, at Eastridge. Not as good as the first. Seriously, who names anything "Desolation of 'Smog'"? Smaug. - So, how's Laura? - She's good. - Yeah, it's a really good thing. - You guys got married. Said he saw it on Facebook. Yeah, we just tried to keep it small, just family. Hey, it's a clean break, I get that, man. It was super clear. Everybody's fine with that. Don't worry about that. It's fine. Well, I'm, uh... I'm kind of done here. Well, shit. I'll tell you the great thing about being manager now... the benefits are awesome. Like, I get to leave super late and I get to arrive super early. How long are you here? We've gotta hang out. Just a couple of days. Yeah, we should definitely hang out. You wanna make a plan now? Should I give you a call or...? We'll hang out now if you want to. Wanna hang out now? Or not. - If you're busy, I can... whatever. - Ahem. Whatever you want is fine. We don't have to hang out at all if you're busy. - I understand. - No, I'm... I'm just a little fried, but, uh, you taking off? Yeah. You want a ride? Yeah, that'd be good. - That good with you guys? - Great. - Great. - Good, yeah! - I'll give you a ride. - Like old times. Yes, oh, yeah. Well, I'll see you guys... see you guys later. - Yeah. Another day. - Another day. Another day. Let me, uh... I gotta settle up here. And I have a sour piece of news. - Hmm? - In my car and not in my pocket is... - Frank, Frank, come on. - ...my wallet. Thank you. - Get out of here. - I'll, uh... I'll text you tomorrow. Great. - Man. - Yeah, I know. - Get out of town. - I know, man. Is this nuts or what? It's been, what, four, five years now? Frank's subtle. Mm. So, what's the deal with Alan? Alan? Okay. Here's what you need to know about Alan. 30 years, he worked for the whole town. 36,000. Drove the same Chevy Malibu. Last three years, he has worked for 12 families and is on his second Porsche, which he just loves to drive around past us. I'm glad you're good, man. You look like the guy I met when you first got to town. - Well, my job is pretty physical. - Mm-hmm. A lot of that's the gym, though, too, isn't it? Isn't it? Come on. - Yeah, I supplement. - Uh-huh. But most of it's, you know, whatever. Whatever. You said you were working where, some kind of hunting thing? Yeah, my uncle has this, uh... he has an outfit. It's... it's nice. Uh, yeah. Clean air. Nice. And Laura's working for a doctor, is that right? Yeah. Big contrast. What are you getting at with that? Oh, nothing, nothing. Just... nothing. Have you met the guy? Is he a nice guy, though? I don't know. I mean, he flies to Bolivia and does cleft palates for free. Ah. So he does boobs and Botox to pay for his Mercedes, is that it? That sounds about right. Eh, I don't know what he drives. It looks like he had a very nice Christmas party, though. I saw it in a post Laura did. Office party, it looked like. I didn't see you in it. Yeah, I don't know. I think I had a work thing or something. I don't remember. Look, man, the Laura thing, it actually is kind of really great. The movies thing, that was... I get it. - No, seriously... - I get it. I get it. I didn't say anything. We were at the movies. Cool. It's just I never told Laura about her. I think it would kill her. He said we should stick to the story. That they're two separate events. That us lying about the girl has nothing to do with the murder and that we didn't even know about the murder until after we made the lie. So that's what just happened. So, yeah. - What was her name? - Who? - The woman he slept with. - I have no idea. He slept with a woman, you picked him up in the morning, and he never told you her name? Why do girls think all guys brag about their conquests? Girls brag way more than guys do. They tell each other everything and they have zero boundaries. What about an address? Frank, um, the morning of New Year's, where did you get him? In town. Across from, uh, the thing with the, you know. Okay, so you don't even know where she lived. Did you give her your job, too? Or just this particular investigation? It's not an investigation. It's just two curious people asking questions. Frank, if you never heard her name or saw a person and you never went to her apartment, how do you know there even was a woman? Okay. I want you to tell him that you told us about the night, - about the lie. - What? - Why? - Just do it tomorrow. I'll see if I can get a man on it. - I probably can't, not yet. - I'll follow him. - What are you, a team now? - Frank, seriously, bro. You lied. Forget just to a friend, but you lied to a friend who's also a cop. And I'm trying to sort through this. And I need some space from you because Joel also happens to be my friend. Now, here's what I want you to do. I want you to go to his hotel in the morning and tell him that you told us. If, after Frank leaves, Joel asks to borrow your car, call me. Stall him. Don't do anything but call me. How's Melissa? Melissa's his wife. They met in middle school. Her dad's a pastor at St. Luke's. What is your problem? This is ridiculous. Francis, I need you to focus. Ta-da! Lovely. Who knocks at their own house? I don't know. It's just, it's... a little weird bringing a girl home to meet your wife. It's stupid. I don't know. Oh, okay. I get it. - Hi. - Hi. And he's going on and on. "Don't worry, she's gorgeous. There's no way she has any interest in me." And what do you know, he's right. What can I say? - You can either finish that - I call it like I see it. or leave the table. Natey told me about your brother. - Mmm. - I, uh... I tell her everything. Not only is she my better half, but she's also a police officer, so. You know, everything stays within the cone. - Mmm. - And your dad's away for life, right? - He's David Neill? - My father is David Neill, yes. I read about his arrest. Yanked him out of the house on Christmas Eve. That must have been quite a game changer, family wise. It was a significant moment in my youth. Hey, eat your vegetables. And your mom, is she... She died a few months ago. - Oh, - I'm sorry I brought that up. She was the lady who I met back in the day. - No, it's fine, trust me. - Apologies. Sorry. I guess... I guess the Neill girls got all the good genes. Not so much with the Neill boys, so. Something like that. Nate. Yeah? - Oh. - We'll... we'll be back very soon. We're gonna need about 15 minutes. Please sit. Enjoy your dinner. We'll be right back, okay? Morgan? Official man-of-the-house hat on, okay? Why? She's pretty, she's smart, she's funny. She's lost. Are you kidding? She is the most focused, directed person I've ever met. Yeah, well, there you go. It's Alan. It's 10:45! But I... Can I just say something else? Uh, no, you have exceeded your quota of words for the evening. Well, then... let me just say I... I feel guilty. Like I'm being untruthful. - To Joel? - Yeah. There's a bigger strategy at work. You're serving a bigger truth. Oh, come on, Alan! He's gonna wake up Morgan. Hey, yeah, what's up? Yeah, what... what time tomorrow, though? Well, I kind of wanted to be up by the property by then. If... right, but if you... Yeah, okay, I can swing by there for a minute, yeah. All right, 10:00 a.m. If you wanted to... oh. So, how was that for holding my ground? Frick. _ Okay, so... last night, after I dropped you off... I went back to the diner... and I told them the truth about that night. I told them that you and I were not at the movies. - Frank, oh, fuck, man. - What's it even matter? - It's, like, four years ago. - What matters is... what matters is I admitted to you that I shouldn't have done it and I literally haven't done anything even like that again. Not even close, man! Okay. Okay, may I ask why? I just thought with everything else that happened that night, it's really important that the truth was out there, you know? And it would've been easy for me to admit it to Laura! I wanted to, I wanted to get it off my chest, but you know what, that would've been the selfish thing. Yeah, you're right, it must've been hard for you to keep this in all those years. Are you serious? Oh, man. No. No, man, it's not on you. It's on me. I made the choice, and... and I don't know if it was the right one, but... to keep it from Laura. To protect her. But it's all fine. Laura will be fine. - You and me, we're good? - Oh, yeah. It's... I mean, it's my fuckup. I'm just... I'm... I'm just glad we're good. - Thanks for coming by. - Yeah, it's no problem. _ Listen, I got to, uh... No, we got to the truth. The hand just confirms it. And when the body is found, it'll be even more so. You can lie to me, but don't lie to yourself. What this is really about, Nate, is you finally having a chance to go back - and rewrite the past. - That's not true, Alan. You didn't like what you perceived to be the way I took it away from you. And now you have someone... one person, finally... who stirs up that sense that you were somehow wronged by me. Alan, it's not about you! No? It's about me trying to do my job. Your job is about me. Lest you forget, when I retired, there were those who felt you were green, remember? And don't make me an idiot for going to bat for you. And don't make yourself an idiot for going to bat for the only person who has a vested interest in turning over the good work of you... yes, you... and all your peers. Now, I need to go. I got clients. And not just the O'Connors, but a bunch of them who have press literally climbing their walls, trying to shiv each other in the back for any version of a story. Are we good? Sure, Alan. We're always good. Okay. So, two days ago, I see my old gymnastics coach at Petco. Now this. Joel. I know. - Tia. - I know. And I assume, you know, if you remember me, you also remember that night. Yeah, I think that is fair to assume, yes. And so, the... the reason I'm here is... well, out of the blue... I'm in a... I'm in a really good thing. I'm married, - and, um... - Hmm. ...I don't know if you know this, but she and I, we were... we were in a thing then, too. Is this like a 12-step thing? No. Well... No, it's, um... I was thinking, um... I don't know if you're ever gonna get approached about this... but if you are and if you're comfortable with it, I was wondering if you would be okay with not mentioning that we actually slept together, if possible. I'm sorry, I... I don't understand. Why would this even come up now? There are some questions about that night. I mean, not that have anything to do with... whatever. It's... it's a long story. But things are... things are really good, and, man, I've worked through a lot with my wife. And if it comes up... Well, I'm not gonna lie. Right, look, I'm... I totally get that. And that's cool. I mean... Because we didn't have sex. Right. Gotcha. - No. - Thank you. No, no, we actually, seriously did not have sex. I'm sorry? I wanted to. I'm not saying I'm proud of that, but you practically fell asleep in my car. I was like, "This is a six-minute ride and he already can't keep his head off the window." And then once we got to my place, all you did was barf and apologize and pass out on my floor. So, uh... so we did not have sex? - We did not have sex. - Wow, that... oh, my God. - Mm. - That is incredible. I mean, holy shit, that is awesome. - Thank you. - Yeah. I mean, it's really me who should be thanking you, 'cause it's like they say, sometimes the best cure for a fantasy is the fantasy itself. Oh, really? I was like, "Here's this guy lying in his own throw up." Yeah, like a polar bear rug or something. And I was like, "Tia, you have created this reality. Mark this time... midnight, new day, new year, new life." So, seriously, thank you. Well, that was a recess for the books. - Yeah. - You know, congratulations on your marriage. - That's a good thing. - Thanks. Hey, Tia, sorry. Um... What do you mean by midnight? That's what time it was when we got in. But you said it was a six-minute car ride and I... I passed out right away. Yeah. But you picked me up at, like, 9:45 or 10:00. I mean, I actually remember specifically. It was... it was 9:46. I got you at literally three minutes to midnight, 'cause as we were driving away, we heard the people cheering. And you said we should kiss 'cause it's midnight, so we pulled over for a second and that was when you were half asleep against the window. So, we drove on, then at 12:08, you were on the floor of my apartment. I was like, "Do I wash his clothes? That's, like, 24 minutes, then it's 33 to dry, which brings me to just after 1:00 a.m., and I have to be at work at 9:00. So, yeah, our entire date lasted - 11 minutes, which... - Awesome. ...given its legendary status, is pretty awesome, right? - Awesome. - Yeah. Well, I really gotta go, so. And thank you. No, thank you. 9:46. I know it was 9:46. I know it was 9:46. Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you know specifically? Do you know specifically? I know it was 9:46. Do you know specifically? - I don't know. - Why the fuck did you come back here? What the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck is... Hey. Hey. Where are you? Uh, someone told me that Cameron had an uncle at the ski school thing. Uh... uh... uh, I... you know, it was early. I didn't wanna wake you, so I rented a car. You could've woken me. Nah, it's... it's all good. The irony is it turned out to be a false lead anyway, so. - Mm. - I'm up there and heading back soon. Um, yeah, well, we're meeting at the hotel at my room, so I'll just text you when we're over there. Okay. Sounds good. Uh, until then, anything I should do? Any... any leads I should follow? Just do what you're doing. Okay, I can do that. Hey, I know Frank told you about the girl on that night. Um, I should've said something. I was just fucking horrified that Nate was gonna tell Laura, and I'd feel bad about that, so... I'm, uh... I'm sorry. It was, uh... it was a tourist. Uh, we met at the bar in town somewhere, as you do. Um, from, like, Norway or something. Which is Helsinki? - Finland. - Finland. It was Finland. I remember I was like, "I don't think I've ever met somebody from Finland before. That's crazy." Yeah, no worries. Um, I'll text you in... when we're over there, all right? Yeah, sounds good. - All right. - Okay. Bye. Finland? Ilsa from Finland? Yep, Ilsa from Finland. I'm trying to figure out why he would lie about who he was with. Well, maybe who he was with will tell us. So, uh, where can I read one of your books? Oh, well, that's easy. Either you go forward in time to when I actually finish one or back in time to just before I completely unravel one and throw it away. I will totally leave that up to you. You... you have a very interesting life. Yeah, well, you're probably standing a little too close to it. So, is there any part of your pie chart at all... that has another person? You know what, Nate? I think when it comes down to it, - I'm just not a pie person. - Yeah. Hey, yo, Teach! We're here on official business. Yeah, I was like, "I think he knows we don't literally bring the kids home with us." Yeah. Uh, Miss B. is the boss of the lending library. Assistant boss. Tia. Petra. I had a feeling I was maybe gonna meet you today. Are you Joel's wife? Wha... no, no. No. Uh, is it okay if we talk inside for a moment? Well, he was worried about hurting his wife, so he wanted to make sure if I talked to someone, I didn't tell them we, you know, whatever, spent the night together. So, he was here? Literally there passed out on the floor. All night? I'm sorry, so you'll go on the record saying that you were with Joel from 10:00 New Year's Eve until... whatever, first thing New Year's Day, and you saw Joel there the whole time? God, he was all hung up on the 10:00 thing, too. I told him it was midnight. Oh, I'm sorry, say that again. I picked him up at midnight. 11:57, actually. Um, official hat here. Tia, it is very important that you tell the truth about this. It is the truth. I bail on the party. He's in the lot. I'm like, "You were my ski instructor." And he's like, "Yeah, what are you doing here?" So, as we're leaving, we hear people celebrating, and he's like, "It's midnight. We should kiss." But when I pull over, he's practically asleep against the window. Six minutes later, we come in, he throws up on himself and passes out at 12:08, which I know 'cause I was like, "Do I wash his pants? Do I not? It's a 22-minute cycle, and I have to be at work at 9:00." This isn't about protecting his wife, is it? Am I missing anyone? Oh, you know, put the previous renters. - Bakers? - Bethels. - Bethels. - Tom and Rachel. And also someone called Dave and Cynthia Warner. - E-L-S Bethels? - Yep. Here's a question for you. What is a girl like you who's smart, pretty, and funny... - Nate. - Tired of the question? No, he just pulled up. And, yes, tired of the question. Okay. Well, Melissa's decided to make you her new project. - She has a list. - Tell her thanks, but I'm good. You tell her. So, what exactly? Vehicular pursuit. February 3rd, three years ago. It's a Saturday. Approximately 4:17 p.m. It was a... it was an icy day. You tired of that question? No. It is what it is. Started off... the whole pain-in-the-butt factor was far outweighed by the... oh-my-God-you're-so-good- to-her factor. Then I was like, "Okay, I get it. I'm a freaking saint. Now, when can we get rid of the race car bunk bed in the master bedroom?" The answer is never. I can never... with my wife, I mean. The toughest part? Figuring out which kind of version of nice I gotta be to not piss her off. Thank you. And that pisses me off. And then it's, like, what kind of anger am I allowed to show? Because if I don't show any anger and... and then she says that I'm not being honest. And I'm not. Hmm. Okay. With Horacio, we're looking at nothing more than just a rushed frame-up. We have two dozen people placing him at a party at his own house for the whole night, so that leads us to Michael O'Connor. He owns the property up the hill. Ah! - Glad you're here. - Hey, Nate. Glad you could make it. Now, this guy Michael was at the party early with Olivia. He was laughing with her, even arm in arm. But he leaves for a dinner at 8:20. But a witness, Tom Davis, puts him back at the house the time of the murder, corroborated by the fact that Olivia called his cell, which tower pings tells us was at his house. The witness, Tom Davis, heard Michael's end of the call. Olivia was complaining about the men in her life, the same as the call that she made to JC, her friend, immediately afterwards. Mr. O'Connor then leaves the next day for Turks and Caicos. - And that's not suspicious? - Is what suspicious? He just takes off to Turks and Caicos? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. This guy takes the same trip every year for 11 years... same day, same flight. No, not a suspect. However, I know this is touchy, but we can't... we can't rule out Eric. On his hammer was found her blood, his prints. He was redoing her studio. What are you doing? Oh, Liv didn't tell you? This is gonna be an office now. It was found in his bag. Who puts a murder weapon in their own bag? Someone in a rush to leave? Or someone who's being framed? Nate, you said in your own case notes "Why is Alan fixated on Eric?" You didn't... you didn't think the case should close when it did. But we're getting off track. Uh, so, we have Eric. That leads us to Cameron. Cameron motive... the safe? Probably. So, check. Means... no idea. Opportunity... no idea. Behavior? Well, he dropped off the face of the Earth. Oh, good work with the maid's niece. There was a water bill that had a forwarding address... in Langer Plain. There's a name... Leticia Aguilar or Letty. I'm still waiting to get approval to go in. - Hey, we'll go. - No, no, no, I still need more time. No, we'll be fine. We can go right now. We're not done here. You were also on the property. Well, I worked there and I lived there, so of course I was there. No, I meant you were there. So, did you see anybody? Or do you know anybody who could be a possible suspect? When you left at 9:46, did you see anyone on your way out? We've got a list. We're just trying to figure out if there was anybody who owed her money or had beefs or anything. Well, I'll put some thought into it. She pissed a lot of people off, so. Can we talk about Ilsa? Or whatever her name is. Sure. So, uh, there's no easy way to say this, so I just will. I'm in a weird place here. Frank told me about your concerns, and, um, I'm not gonna say anything to Laura. I believe that's between you two to, um... whatever, to work out. But there's nothing else, though, is there? Nothing else what? That I need to know about, Joel. No. Okay. Okay, cool. - You sure? - Yeah. Okay. Okay, to Leticia's. Great. Oh, hey, Nate wanted me to ask you a question. JC said you owed her. I don't follow. Well, we were talking about people who owed her money back at the hotel, and I just remembered that JC said that... Look, tons owed her. In my case, it was murky. I mean, when I first started there, she was like, "Hey, you can work instead of rent." And then all of a sudden, she's like, "You owe me for 10 months." And I was like, "What?" But I wouldn't say I owed. Oh, you're gonna turn up here. So, what are you saying? This is written down somewhere? Well, what was written down is that she was gonna go into the new year... she and Eric both... clean, without owing or being owed. And JC said he found this out right before Christmas, so. Anyway, I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry too much about it. Wait. When? I just told you, before Christmas. No, when did you hear this? Various times over the last week. You and Nate spoke about this, and you and JC spoke about this? I thought you said you could not get anybody to talk to you out here? I said no one wanted to talk to me. _ - Leticia? - You're Joel? Hi, I'm Petra. - You got a minute? - Yeah. Cameron would constantly blab about the safe in the lady's studio and how it was always keeping cash. And then he said there were some art drawings for her charity, and he had did research, and they were worth $75,000. So, then he figured out the combination to the safe - and... - Wait, I'm sorry. He just figures out the combination? In the Sylvester Stallone movie "Escape Plan," they tell which safe numbers are used the most by how dark the keys are. And so, he goes to the studio and he was like, "Okay, 5 is darkest by a lot, and then the 7 and the 8." And so, then he Googles a whole bunch of stuff, including her birthday, which turns out to be May 7, 1958. 5-7-5-8. - So then he broke in? - I don't know. 'Cause then he was gone. Christmas Eve. My Aunt Flor was like, "I told you about him." How did she know him? I don't know. They were busybodies, my aunt and her friends. She worked for the rich people, so she thought she was so important. Then she left and she was suddenly just an old Mexican lady in Mexico again. That's another one I don't need to bother with. When did she leave? Somewhere around New Year's. We weren't close. I wasn't keeping track. You know how to reach her? No. Anyway, she got married, moved out of Mexico. I have no idea what her last name is now or what country she's even in. What is it that you keep looking at in there? Is that painting... by the window, is that a Xavier Martinez? I don't know. My uncle had it. You should have it looked at. Why? It's ugly. How much would you sell it for? A hundred dollars? You should have it looked at. Let's go. Thank you. So, clearly, Cameron tried to break into the safe. That's why he cut the security footage, and that's probably why I saw him there the month before that. The plan? Steal it on New Year's when everyone's distracted. But she... she surprises him. She goes back to the studio and catches him in the act. We know that the safe was banged up. We know that the money and the drawings were gone. I'm... I'm sorry. Is it rude of me to ask why you keep changing your sunglasses? Is it a looks thing? Well, not my looks. But I like to have at least some control over the way things look around me. Anyways, I'm checking with a bunch of kids' book art dealers, emailing a bunch to see if anybody's ever tried to fence one of her drawings. It won't prove anything. Are you kidding me? It will prove he stole them. We already know he stole them. But he was gone on Christmas. He left Leticia on Christmas. Maybe even made a big show of doing it, too... her, the landlord... so people would think he was out of town. Then he just sneaks back in on New Year's. The safe had already been robbed, which was why it was empty when the murder was discovered. You don't know that. It could have been robbed that night. Why would you break into a safe you already had the combination to? They found a body. Nope. No. You cannot be here, Alan. Is that her? Alan, what are you doing here? Tom Davis, he runs... represents the owners of the property. I'm aware of who he is, but right now, this property is under my jurisdiction. We're not going to get in anybody's way... You already are in the way. Don't you talk to me that way! I'm not doing this now. Dave? - Alan, it's all right. - It's time to go, Mr. Pape. - Get your hands off me. - Mr. Pape, it's time to go. - Alan... - Oh, good. No. Nope. Trust me, you guys do not want to be the technicality that gets this case shut down again. "Down again"? You mean it's open? Unofficially. I'm trying to get it reopened. And in light of the new circumstances, I think I got a pretty good shot. Well, that's... that's great. Yeah, as long as nobody screws it up and I get to do the job the way I need to do it. Is that why Alan was so angry? It's complicated. Alan is mad because he's not boss anymore and because he's trying to get information that I can't give him, - or to anyone! - Anyone? Yeah, anyone, meaning specifically people who are not involved in this case. I need you guys off the property now. Detective, a statement, please. Joel, please. Hey! Especially you. Look, I'm sorry, but things are different now. I... I can't communicate with you. - Are you serious? - I need you off the property now. Is it Olivia Lake? Would you secure this, please? Can you please give us some more information? No comment. Come on, Dave, John. No comment! Please, no comment. Um... excuse me, Petra. I... think I need to take a walk or something. Oh, sure, sure. Of course. I gotta... I gotta think about some stuff, too. Synced & corrected by -robtor- www.addic7ed.com
