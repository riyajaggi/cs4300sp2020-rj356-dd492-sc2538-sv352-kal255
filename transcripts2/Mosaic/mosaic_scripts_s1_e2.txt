 I looked over, and I'm like, "That's the face from a book I worshipped." Eric Neill. Hi. - Olivia Lake. - Yeah, of course. You might be the reason I became an artist. She's gonna show your stuff to people? This is huge for me. She makes me nervous. You got my name from... People familiar with your skills. The owner has an unhealthy attachment

 to the property. Get her to sell it. You know when you'll know when I'm moving on? When you're standing at my gravesite. - Okay. - Okay? What happens when he actually sees in? - It's all about... - Trust. - It's not much. It's 25K. - What is this? I dated it for a couple days ago so it doesn't seem like I wrote it just for this meeting. Sometimes with these money guys... take it from a VC guy, former VC guy... it helps to have skin in the game. If it makes sense in the mood of the room,

 pull it out, okay? What if this is one of those Dennis Klein kind of things? Wouldn't that be funny? - I know, right? - Right? Hi. Eric Neill. - Tom Davis. - Good to meet you. - Hey, Tom. - Olivia. Please. Thanks. Michael, this is a man named... - Eric Neill. - Eric Neill. Please, have a seat. - Hey. - Hi. How are you? So, what is this amazing pitch about? The idea is that since you guys were the initial investors, the seed angels, of Mosaic, we thought we should give you the first chance to get in on the ground floor of the expansion. Well, your thoughts and points are very well taken and we'll certainly look into what we can and cannot do. - We'll talk to our guys. - Of course. You look like the cat that ate the canary. It's just funny. Seriously. What, 30 years? This is the least I've ever seen you talk in one sitting. Well, you know, I've just... I've taken this really seriously and I don't want to blow it by doing what I usually do, which is saying one sentence too many or talking one minute too long, so... Uh, are you both...? We've put in 25K to start. He... he's put in, but, you know, I'm considering my options. Such as? Well, I mean, we've all been in this since the beginning, so, you know, things that were... previously considered immutable... You know, I have to think about it, but... everything... everything is on the table. Changes. - What do you mean? - Happening. Not just the studio per se, but the... the whole place in general. I don't know, I haven't really thought it through. I just... I don't like dishonesty. That, I have thought through. Okay. Just... I find it interesting that you never told me about your little girlfriend. The meadowlark. What, Laura? She's cute. She's bubbly, she's friendly. You know, I'm a big girl. I've been around. I know the track. All right, I still don't understand. Come on, you pretended you were infatuated with me when, really, you were just infatuated with what you hoped you would be, and you saw me as an avenue to get there. You know, don't pretend that you weren't throwing me all kinds of signals. I mean... I admit I fell for them, okay? But that was sneaky. You were sneaky. You're a sneaky, sneaky boy, okay? Oh, whatever. Oh. That's Eric. He'll be moving into the main house. You can help him get those drawers inside. - Hey. - Hey. He is... oof. Joel, come here and meet Eric. Joel, come on. This is the guy I told you about. - The boarder. - Oh. Who is here to help you as instructed. He is a sneaky, sneaky boy. I really appreciate your help with this. Yeah, sure. Where do we drop it? Just down here at the end of the hall, but... Yeah... okay. Oh, hey, Joel, that bench at the end of the trail, it's, um, off-balance. Would you put some of those, uh, un-off-balancers under it? - Got it. - Okay, thank you. The guy's got an odd energy. Yeah, pound puppies, you know. Never know when they're gonna snap at you. You know, $25,000... I don't care how much money you got, that's incredibly generous. It's all good. It's just money, right? You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. Who here goes to Pine Canyon Elementary School, and who just wet their pants? Oh! And who knows what this story is about? Awesome! That's so nice. All right, who wants to do the spinning? - Me! - Oh, I think we'd better let Miss Markel do it. Come on, let's let teacher go first. Oh, teacher first. Teacher first. Okay, great. Now, I want you to be careful here as we go by the workman. Okay, careful. Come on. That's good. Now, stop on the rock before here so that she can spin. Even tall, stupid, dorky, overgrown children can come with us today. What?! Don't you laugh at that! - Guh! - Now, what's this story about? - What animal? - A bear! That's right. Okay, now, if you know what this is about... - Hey, yeah. - ...don't be afraid to read along... This is really not a good time. I'll call you back. No, there's no ETA. The day after what? I can't say I can hit that. This is not a good time. I'll get you back. "the monster was blue." Great job. Now, who knows what glimpsed means? You wouldn't believe the hoops we've had to jump through. I mean, each state has its own... well, Wyoming thinks that charitable purposes means one thing and Arizona something entirely different. We thought we'd have the paperwork done by summer. We were being stu... uh, optimistic. Well, in theory, each spoke becomes a hub, and then the hubs kind of fan out and, well... you know, your son is brilliant. Uh-oh. - Oh, God. In vino, veritas. It means "in wine, truth." And I've had maybe a glass and a half too much vino, so you'll forgive me if there's perhaps a glass and a half too much of veritas. - Oh, my God. - Mm. Eric... you scared the hell out of me. At first. Spooked me. Because she fell hard fast. Which I'm used to. But she's always had this uncanny ability to sprout... whatever... bat wings and then... I believe the phrase "bat out of hell" was coined to describe your relationship to relationships. Hence my always available tub of Double Fudge Chunk. But I think this will be the first tub I finish myself. 'Cause for the first time in 24 years, no evidence of wings. So, those arms of yours had better fucking be strong and open and available. Wow... maybe it was two and a half glasses too much vino. Apologies. Oh, I loved it. Ho, ho, ho. Oh, thank you, darling. - Here we go. - Hey, man. Oh! One of those on the fire. Just dump the rest right there. Let's keep it warm. Thank you. Hold on a sec. Um... Uh, eh, you know what? - Merry Christmas. - What? Yeah, you work your ass off around here. Thanks, man. Holy shit. Hey, we're just about to have a toast. - You want a drink? - Oh, yeah. Hey, not too much. He's driving. One drink's not gonna make a difference. I'm from Minnesota. I think I know what that means. I'm sure you do. Just don't let the Hulk out. Yeah, what? Oh, yeah, sorry, it's been a crazy time. Yeah, well, it's 2:00 a.m. here. This was your drop-dead date, not mine. I told you it would take as long as it takes. I can't answer that. Because I just can't. I gotta go. I can't do this. I can't answer that. Because it's complicated. Who was on the phone? A voice from the past. Ugh. I hate those. Mr. Eric, she's here! Gracias. - Hi, Graciella. - Hi. How are you? Hi. Good. How was your day? It was pretty good. Yeah. What's with the candles on the floor? Ah, maybe you find out. Maybe I find out. - Okay. - Yeah. - What's going... - Hey. Oh, my God. Oh... You, uh... you wanna get married? Uh... - Yeah. - Yeah? - All right. - Yeah. Hey! How you doing? Happy New Year. I'm assuming you have good news for me. Well, I have big news. It's over. Olivia and I are engaged. Wait, I'm... I'm sorry? It's over. We're engaged to be married. Is this a joke? No, it is not. We had an agreement. You don't just get to decide this. Things changed. So here's the remaining money, a little over 53K. It'll more than cover your flight. What am I supposed to do with this? Keep it, give it to your client, I don't care. You don't understand. You're not alone in this. Hey, I flew here. I fuckin' flew here because... Because apparently you don't get your fee, whatever the fuck that is, until I deliver. Well, I'm not going to deliver, so this is as whole as you're ever gonna get. What you do with it is up to you. Is this real? It is. Huh, till she finds out the truth about how it all started. We'll find out in about six hours because I'm telling her tonight. About everything. If you're saying you would like me to include you in that story, I'm happy to. Otherwise, this is the last you and I will ever communicate about anything. Are we clear? Whoo! Hey, hi. Good to see you. - Bruce, hi. How are you, honey? - Hey, good to see you. - So good to see you. How's Nick? - Good. Good? Good. Hi, hi. Hi! - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! - Hi. How are you guys doing? - Great. - How's the business? - It's doing great. Is it? Good. Hi. - Great party. - Thank you. You guys having fun? Shelly, hi. It's nice to see you. - Marla, hi. - Oh, my gosh, this party's so fabulous. - Thank you so much. - Mwah. Good. - Hi, Brian. Good to see you. - Good to see you. You two... I figured I'd find you with two men in the corner... as usual. Hi, everybody. You having fun? - Hi! - Everything good? - Yes, great! - It's great. The food's good. - Is it? Good. Did you eat? - Yeah. He's so cute, you know? That's Betty's kid. And he's just been great. He's so lovely. - Oh, I screwed it up. - You did. Do you want me to make a shot for you? - Yes, please. - All right. - Whoo! - Oh! - I tried. - I know. I still love you, though. - Olivia, hi. - Happy New Year. Hey, Chris and Arden Clarke from down the hill. We met you at the hay ride, and you invited us to stop by. - Yeah, thanks for coming! - Thank you. - Okay. - Sorry, we were told that you never do this, but our daughter Stella would kill us if we don't at least ask. Okay. Human or bear? - Uh, I think a bear. - Bear? Bear for Stella, okay. I gotta go get that stuff and I'll... - Thank you. - Okay. Hey, psst. Can you get him to cover for you - so we can...? - Yeah, sure. - Kevin, you good? - Yeah, man. Just wanna talk to you for a sec. What's up? I need to come clean about a few things. Honestly, one of them is why you're here to begin with. - Okay. - All right, the theme of this conversation is moving forward, not back. Just... I think we should both look forward only, okay? All right, I'm gonna sell this place. I'm gonna let it go. All of the dreams that I had for it and myself are over, and I think that you should do the same, okay? I'm not sure I'm quite getting what you're saying. Yeah, 'cause I'm not really saying it. It's not really gonna happen for you, Joel. I'm sorry? Your work, it's... it's nice, it's... it's good. It's... it's proficient. I wish there was really more under it, but there isn't, and I don't really think there's... ever gonna be. Are you cool with this? Okay, go on. There really is nowhere else to go with this. I mean, I think that's really where we're at. Okay? You've hit a wall, Joel, and there really is only two ways to go. I mean, up and over it, which I don't really think is gonna happen, or back and the other way. Why have I been here, then? I mean... Because you were handsome, and I was afraid of getting old. I am afraid of getting old, and you looked at me like I was the thing that I was so desperately trying to recapture. And I appreciate that. But if we're honest, here... I don't think that that ever really existed, did it? So, I think we should both just square up the rent... - and move forward. - Wait, what? The... the rent that I deferred, the $1,500 lease. What are you talking about? Look, I don't wanna owe you, I don't want you to owe me. - I was working in exchange for the rent. - I think it's clearer that way. No, the rent was less because you were working. I got $3,000 - from the last tenant I had over there. - What are you talking about? Did you not read the contract? - I cleaned out your septic tank... - Did you just sign it - without even reading it? - ...ln the rains in October. - I know. - I was knee-deep in your shit. - I am aware of your work. - You lied to me! - No, I'm not paying you money that I don't owe you. - You should go back there. - You should look at the contract. - Don't fucking patronize me! Look into your heart and decide what you think that you should pay. You are a manipulative, selfish, narcissistic liar. - Well, that may be true, Joel. - You're only moving on - because you failed at everything. - You should read the contract. And you're trying to rationalize it by saying that giving up is moving on. Now you want me to give up, too, just so you can feel better about yourself?! - If you want to. - No. Oh, fuck you! - Fuck you! Happy fucking New Year! - Fine! Fine! Ooh. Hoo-hoo-hoo. Hoo. Hey. Hey. Uh... Well, that happened. Uh... I... do... are you... Can you... are you available to, uh... - I would love... - ...to talk? To talk to you. Okay. All right. - Okay. - Oh. Yeah, I gotta go get some paper and stuff for those people. - They want a bear. - Okay. Okay. All right. Well, then I'll just come... - Yeah. - Yeah. I thought we weren't drinking. We said in the new year, which is tomorrow. I just... I don't wanna go there. Go there? What... go where? Now I have two people telling me that I'm in a sinkhole? I didn't say that! Is... is that what she said to you? Oh, that I'm in a sinkhole and that I owe her eight months' rent. And, oh, yeah, what was the other thing? That I don't have a fucking shred of talent! God! Come on, have some. Joel, Joel, you're kind of scaring me. Joel, don't pour that for me. Let's just go to Nate and Melissa's... What, and have milk and fucking cookies? I'm 28 fucking years old, Laura. And Olivia Lake is a fucking bitch! Okay, Joel. I'm gonna go. I'll see you at brunch tomorrow... Yeah, I look forward to it! Happy New Year. Okay. Um... this discussion, what I'm gonna say is utter, rock-bottom truth. Okay. W-what you've done for me has never happened to me before, okay? You've changed me to my core, and I... I love you. I really, genuinely am in love with you. Given that you've already proposed, I just don't see this as news. Okay, yeah. Okay, okay. Fair enough, um... What I feel for you... I'm sorry, I know this is all over the map. What I feel for you is so real that I wanna start with that. Do you, uh, believe that? Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah, I do. Okay. The next few things I'm gonna say are gonna be hard. All I ask is that you wait tight, I... I get it all out. Dennis Klein. What? Dennis Klein. What about Dennis Klein? He was fake. What? No. Eric. Please, let me... I gotta go through the whole thing in order. I said to JC, I joked, you know, that Dennis Klein was a hell of a wingman. But it wasn't a joke, was it? Everything that we have right now is real. Really? Is it real? What's real? I mean, are you... are you real? Please let me just do this in order, okay? So you can just take me through the tube? I don't understand. Just ride me like a surfer. - Just manage my fears. - Oh. O-okay, I've always said you're perceptive, but, no, I just... I just wanna do this in the right... Well, this is no longer your conversation, Michael. Michael, oh. Oh, the... the $25,000 check, it's... Oh, I joked. I said, "Oh, what if this is like Dennis Klein?" And you... you said, "Oh, I know," and then you laughed. You laughed! Oh, you... What is his real name?! - Please stop. - What is Dennis Klein's real name? His real name is Casey Delacroix. I did something really dumb, but in a way it wasn't 'cause that's how I got to meet you. And I ended everything that brought me to this point. That's what you need to know now. I thought you fell from the sky. I'm a fucking idiot. But... but, actually, I'm the one who had the lucky basket. See? I'm the one... Oh, you're a missile. You're a targeted missile. Who sent you here? - Who sent you here? How did you get here? - Okay. - I got a phone call. - When was it? Who did it? Who did this to me? I got a phone call by someone who knew someone who wanted to buy your land... a lawyer. We met because of a fucking lawyer? I bailed on it, though. It's gone! I'm telling you it's 100% gone. Okay, yes, I was hired to pretend to be an investor because that seemed like a way to get you interested in me. But, no, no, no, no. But it's over. - It's all over. - I don't know what's happening. No. No, no, it's over. I'm still the same person. I don't even know who you are! I'm Eric! I'm still Eric! I don't even know if that's your fucking name! It's my name. I swear to God, it's my name. - Who the fuck are you? - I'm the same person. Where the fuck did you come from? What the fuck are you doing here?! - Listen, if you need some time... - I want you to take your shit - and I want you to get the fuck out of my house! - No, no, no! - I want you to get the fuck out of here! - No, I love you! - Get the fuck out... - I love you! - It's all real. - How the fuck can you say that? - I do. No, no, no. - Who does this to people? No. No, Olivia. - How could you fucking do this to me? - I don't know. I'm sorry! - I want you to... to get your shit. - No, I love you. - And I want you to get the fuck out of my house. - You need some time. - You just need some time. - I was in love with you. - I love you. - I loved you. - Don't you understand? - I do. - You get your shit! - No. No, no, no, no. - You get the fuck out of my house! - No, no, you just... - you need some time, okay? - Just get the fuck away from me! Get away from me! Get away from me! It was you, wasn't it? Eric Neill. You are not coming back here. I am calling you-know-who, and I'm gonna fucking bury you. Don't you dare come back here, and I am done. I'm done talking to you. If you can't say it to my face... - Oh, shit. - ...leave me a message. Oh, JC, when you call in for this, I hope it costs you, like, eight million pesos or whatever the fuck the currency is in Ibiza. Ibiza. Oh, shit. I am such a fucking idiot. I mean, my choices in men including and specifically you in this moment. I cannot believe that I let you go away this one New Year's Eve. I mean, you should know me well enough by now to know that I didn't mean it. I lost my train. Uh... men, yeah. Men, yeah. You know? Every goddamn one of them that I invite into my house are just a bunch of fucking... liars and con men and... fucking violent. I mean, one of them tonight, he just fucking had his fist, like, right up and was just screaming and spitting and his nostrils flaring and his jaw all clenched. And, I mean, honest to God, I just thought it was like... Oh, my fucking God. Look who's back. Ugh, fuck. - Hi. - Hey. So there's still no body? No, but it's pretty bad in there. - Okay. - Yeah. - Okay. - Get prepared. - Let's go have a look. - Okay. Yeah. So, yeah. Someone tried to clean this up and then thought better of it. Mm-hmm. Oh, boy. - Who found this? - That's the thing. Graciella... she's the housekeeper... called and I asked her who discovered the scene. And at first, she said she did, but then I asked again. It was actually the gardener who found it. Horacio Romero. Well, why didn't he call this in himself? I don't know. - Nate? - Yeah? - You wanna take a picture? - I'm trying. These are only a few questions. They're not gonna take very long. I apologize for the inconvenience. Do you think maybe... bambinos... do you think you maybe could, um... could get out of the room? No. No, it's... it's just this might be a little bit difficult for them. - This is a sensitive issue. - Oh, sí, sí. Thank... muchas gracias. Thank... thank you. Oh. One moment. This is my boss. Hey, Alan. Yes, it's me. I'm here. Yeah, well, to be honest... even so... I don't think the prints are real. What do you mean they're not real? They're footprints in blood from boots that belong to the very person you're speaking with, so take him in now. - Sir? Hi, Alan. - Yeah. Two things. One... forensics just confirmed only 20 to 30 pounds of pressure on those boot prints. They were faked, probably by hand. - The gardener was framed. - As Nate suspected. Two... this is Mr. Clarke. He's a neighbor. He was at the party. Olivia went to the studio to get a drawing for his daughter. We thought she'd want a bear, but when I texted her, she said she wanted a human, so I went outside to tell Olivia, and that's when I heard her arguing in her studio. With who? Well, she went out there with her fiancé. - She was engaged? - Yeah. And the valet saw him leaving in a rush right after. - Time? - The text to the girl is 10:10. - We have a name? - Eric Neill. Nate, come back here. Leave the gardener. I'll explain when you get here. Just get here. What's going on, Alan? I just drove 45 minutes in two directions. The boyfriend was overheard arguing with Olivia inside the studio just after 10:00 p.m. New Year's Eve. The valet guy saw him race out in his car right after. And just six weeks ago, she put him in her will. I'm sorry, who are we talking about? His name's Eric Neill. Had priors... con man. - We have to nail this guy. - Eric Neill. Okay, what about the gardener? No, find out where he went. - Off the gardener. - I can't leave here. Eric. Hey. Hey, Ma. You don't look good. Did... did someone hurt you? No, Ma. No, I, uh... I hurt someone. Hmm. Well, what I need you to do is to ask Clarence... he's the only good one in here... why my remote doesn't get DVDs. It's just... Your skin is pale. You look sick. Which... which reminds me, you've gotta tell your sister to get some other bulbs. I told her twice. These fluorescents, they're just ghastly. Laura's gonna freak. She's not gonna freak, dude. - No, she will. - She won't. Why would she freak if you were at the movies with me? Too bad we got a little buzzed. You had to crash at my place in your old room, which I still haven't fucking filled. Desolation of Smaug." Yeah, 10:20 showing, Eastridge Mall. "Hobbit." Okay. 10:20, okay, cool. You want me to tell you the plot? It's just more Hobbity stuff. She won't ask anyway. Whoa, whoa! What happened to your hand? Laura and I got in a fight. You hit her? No! Jesus, no. I don't know, I was pretty out of it. I must've hit a wall or something. Okay. "Desolation of Smaug." 10:20. All right, cool. So... do I get to hear who you were with? I was with... a mistake. Well, I do feel like we're in a cycle, and that cycle just keeps repeating. Do you remember my... my uncle with the boats? - Vern? - Yeah, Vern. Well, he said if you ever wanted to work for him, he's got that place, the alligator place. I mean, what... land is cheap down there. We could get a... a really nice piece of land, like a house with a wraparound porch. I've always wanted a wraparound porch. We could start fresh. Let's just go. Let's just get out of here. When? Now? I mean, seriously, there's nothing keeping us here. What about my truck? Sell it. Neill's driving a 2011 Range Rover. 22 highway... we assume he's on a highway. Last fill-up was two days ago at the Shell station on Bleakmoore and Summit. It's a 14-gallon tank. So, we should check gas stations within a, what, 300-mile radius? What about the ATM? Once outside Salt Lake last night, and again first thing this morning. Both 800, his max. Okay, so he's traveling. What about the cell phones? Last ping was just off Temple Square by the university, 18 hours ago. Which means what? - He's still there? - Mm-hmm. Or he turned off his phone. - Which would be smarter. - Right. How long was he there? The phone went off at 10:45 p.m., on again at 7:22, then off for good. Who'd he spend the night with? I think his mother is in Salt Lake. In hospice. All right. So... who's our guy at Salt Lake PD? - Sergeant Reeves? - Yes. - It's Charles, right? - Absolutely. - How are you? - I'm well. - Good to see you again. - My pleasure. Good to see you. - Thanks for waiting. - My pleasure. Neill's mother is just down the hallway. The desk said someone matching his description spent the night, left early this morning. His sister's in here at the moment. Okay. How are you? Well, let's say hello. Dr. Singh, call 3468. - Miss Neill, hi. - Hey. This is Detective Henry, Summit Police. - Nice to meet you, ma'am. - Hi, nice to meet you. - May we come in? - I'd... I'd rather you not. My mother is, um... she's sleeping and she's quite ill. Sure. What did Eric do this time? You happen to know where he is? Probably Truckee. We have a cabin there in North Shore Lake Tahoe, California side. What'd he do? It's very important that we speak with him. Do you happen to have an address for this cabin? Pickup at outpatient PT. Pickup at outpatient PT. Yeah. My friend, too much miles. But it runs really good, man. It always has. I'll tell you what, you take her for a test spin, you name the price. I drive? Start her up. I don't understand what's happening. I haven't slept one minute in three days. W-where's the other guy? I told the other guy the same thing. I-I don't understand what's happening. Yeah. Well... apparently, Detective Pape doesn't believe that you don't understand. So we're gonna do this again. And again. - I'm gonna offer you... - I don't want a lawyer. I don't need a lawyer. Do you understand the implications if you don't get... I don't want a lawyer. Okay. So, it's New Year's Eve. You tell Olivia the truth. She hits you, she threatens to call the police. Yes. You bolt. Yes. You realize that if she does call the police, you're effed. You have priors, so you come back. No. So, you came back into the studio. You tried to talk sense into her. No, seriously, that's not what happened. I never came back. I never came back. I never, ever, ever came back. I didn't find out that she was... until they came for me in Truckee. What I don't understand is why you changed your story twice in Truckee when the police came. Come on, man. We got your prints on the hammer. She had just put you into her will. She did? Oh, shit. Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry. This is super silly, but I have been tasked with tracking down literally 125 people and getting their literal whereabouts between 9:30 and 1:00 a.m. - Well... - Movies, right? - Yeah, movies. - With Frank. - Yeah, with Frank. - Right. We took El Camino to Arroyo Parkway to the Eastridge Mall and saw the 10:20 "Hobbit 2." Okay, all right. 10:20. Thank you. You are dismissed, laddie. Good accent. Let's go talk to Frankie. Okay. - Okay. - Your turn. My turn. I'll bring him right back, I promise. So, what'd I miss? Um, well, Mel was just saying there's this weird pressure to solve this thing fast. - From who? - Oh, my God, it's, you know, people on the hill to the DA to Nate's boss to Nate. I mean, it's all the way down. They're trying to send a message to the riffraff. Do we even have riffraff? Um, we had that shoplifter... The hand of children's book author Olivia Lake has been discovered in a stream
