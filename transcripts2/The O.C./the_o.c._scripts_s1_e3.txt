 What're you doing with my girlfriend? Kill me and quit talking about it. Dude, this place is on fire! We gotta go! Sorry. Ryan Atwood? We got some questions for you. It was an accident. Then we got some questions for you, too. We got to stop meeting like this. Some good news. Kirsten's company has dropped all charges. Which means-- pending your probation hearing-- you'll be out, no problem. When's that? 30 to 60 days. I could have you out sooner

 if I could release you into the care of a parent or a guardian. He gets to leave? Who? Luke? Well, according to both of you, the fire was an accident. He's got no priors. His record's clean. And he has someone to take him home. Ryan, you know, if I could... It's going to be okay. (scoffs) My mom ditched me. I burned your wife's house down. How is this going to be okay? We'll find your mother. And what if we don't? We will do whatever it takes. I mean, what if I don't want to find her? If only you'd come to me... instead of running away... Why? So I could end up in Child Services and foster care? You could have died in that fire. Look... you've done more than enough. I can take care of myself. Won't be that different from how it's been. We'll talk again before your hearing. Tell your... wife... thanks. Already did. (indistinct talking) Sorry. You ain't now, but you will be. S01E03 - The Gamble Now all we need are the Bellinis... and can you make mine a double? Wow. You're all set up for your Newpsie convention. Hey, when do... when do these vultures land?

You're lucky you're only grounded. Can I see him? Ryan? No. There's nothing I can do for him now. Yeah? You think he's okay? There's a reason why I like to try to keep kids out of those places. You can't get him out. You're not a good lawyer My hands are tied unless we find his mother. Then, why can't he stay here? I will not have this conversation again. Rosa, can you make sure that the scones go inside? If anything happens to Ryan, then, it's all on you. What I can't live with is if something was to happen to you because of him. Like I meet someone who doesn't suck We're not his parents. I'm not his mother. Good thing. Hey! Get back here. Apologize. (doorbell rings) Ladies. Sandy, hi. How are you? Are you holding up okay? That poor boy. He's locked up, yes? Yeah, temporarily. Well, nobody blames you for bringing him into the community. You're so trusting, Sandy. Hey, Julie, their house looks good. I thought it burned down. Oh, not this one-- one of Kirsten's developments. Luckily, she has so many. Well... I should be off. Got to find the next kid to jeopardize the community. Maybe a black kid. Or an Asian kid. Bye, ladies. How about a Bellini? ALL: Yes. Look at this food! Who's sorry now? You got a problem? You disrespecting me? As long as you're here, you best watch out for me, man. (panting) Well, I think it's an absolute embarrassment that the fund-raiser is two days away, and we don't have a theme. I thought it was Casino Night. I thought it was Monte Carlo. No, it's Vegas Night. See, this is a travesty. It can't be Monte Carlo Night. Cotillion is coming up. I mean, don't you remember our amendment? No two black-tie events in the same month. I'll be right back. Um, I have to go, uh... check on the thing. She's been through so much. Her son... was friends with that boy. Where do you think you're going? (sighs) What are you doing out here? I'm taking a Newpsie break. Where are you going? I'm not going anywhere. Seth. I'm going to Juvie to visit Ryan. No. No, you're not. No way. Okay, bye. Seth. I know that I am not the perfect Carol Brady mom, but I love you, and I am trying to protect you. I have dropped all the charges. I have hired somebody to find his mother. What more do you want? I would like you to go with me. (door opens) Kirsten? Oh, there you are. We're talking about the bunting. Is acetate okay? Sounds great. Okay. Give me 15 minutes to lose the ladies. Can I try this on? Summer, my dad's home, you know. You say that like it's a bad thing. Oh, gross. Your dad's always home these days. What's up with that? Hey, Luke, it's me. I just... wanted to talk, so call me. Um... please. Still hasn't called you back? He was in lockup. Maybe he's into dudes now. (laughing) God, he loves you. He got in a fight. And burnt a house down over you. That's hot. Do you need more? How about talking to me? Well, he'll get over it. He can't really think you're into that Chino kid. (sighs) So... how's your mother? Uh, just... married. Marissa? You've got company. Oh, my God. Sorry. Uh... Hi, Summer. Um, um... I'm Seth Cohen. I live... I live right next door. What's up? I... What? Yes. What is up? Uh... I'm going to visit Ryan. I thought, maybe you'd like to come. He'd love to see you. (speaking loudly): Uh, what, Seth? Did you say you need a ride to a Star Wars convention? A Star Wars convention? I'm sorry. Her top was off. You couldn't have said "X-Men" for me? Look. I can't go with you. I can't see Ryan. I mean, Luke's not talking to me as it is. So? Ryan's in jail. I thought we were all friends. It's just... It's too complicated. To visit him? I can't, okay? Yeah. Fine. Whatever. (door lock clanking) Let's just make this quick, okay? Uh, Kirsten and Seth Cohen. MAN: Here you go. Thank you. Hey. What happened to your neck? It's... nothing. You okay? Great. So, I'm sorry the plan didn't work. I thought I had it figured out. Thought you were safe. Hey, what's the matter, huh? Give me a smile. (sighs) So, Marissa seemed pretty weird when I tried to talk to her. What happened between you guys? You got a nice swerve on you, lady. You fine. Hey, leave her alone. Ryan, it's okay. You jokin'. This your little honey? Come here, bitch. I want to get a good look at you. Seth, let's go. Now. Uh, guard. I only need two minutes. Leave her alone. Seth, now! What you going to do about it, man? Guard! I'm going to kill you, punk ass. (grunting) You're dead! You hear me? You dead! Seth... what did we say? No video game. Oh. I never knew you to be an impulse shopper. I didn't know what else to do. You tell him it was permanent No, of course not. 'Cause we can't keep jerking th- pulling him out of Juvie, sending him to foster care, giving him hope, and-and taking it away. They were going to kill him in that place, Sandy. He couldn't stay there. But he can't stay here. We've got to find his mother. He doesn't want to find her. He's a kid. He doesn't know what he wants. So I guess I won't unpack. Hey. Hey. Help yourself to a wide assortment of breakfast cereals. So, Ryan, what, uh, what exactly happened that night with Marissa before Luke showed up? She came to see me. And? And I told her to leave. You asked her to leave? That's it? You two up there, alone, and you expect me to believe that. I thought I was taking off. It didn't seem right. Well, I mean, you're still here. She lives next door. I don't know. I said some things. So now's your chance to take it back. Hey, I'm off. They're waiting for me in the ballroom. Those ladies can't do anything unless I'm there. You should come. It'll be fun. Well, not fun, but it's for charity. No, thanks. Marissa, honey, enough moping. It's very sweet that you're so concerned about this boy, but he's in the system now. He's being taken care of. And he's not your responsibility because he's in love with you. He's not in love with me. Why not? He thinks he's too good for you? Actually, he thinks I'm too good for him. Well, he's right, but that's the past, and you need to focus on the future, which means Luke. You've invested so much with Luke, honey. Your relationship has too much potential to be squandered by some silly misunderstanding. So I want you to finish your hair, put on a nice top, and please come join me at the club, hmm? Okay. Thanks, Mom. It's what I'm here for. I've to make some calls, so if you could finish up in the kitchen, that would be terrific. Where are you going? I got an early court date. I'm in and out of the office. I have to set up for Casino Night. What about Ryan? I got two calls about his mother. Yeah, but what am I supposed to do with him? Take him with you. Spend some time together. With all those women there? Sure. They'll love him. Oh, hi, Julie. Kirsten, Seth. Julie, this is Ryan. I'm Julie Cooper. I've heard so much about you. Nice to meet you, too. There he is. Hey, Mrs. Cooper. Hey, Luke. Oh. Hi, Luke. Thanks for coming. Yeah, you know, anything I can do to help make amends for what happened. Luke, it's good to see you. Ryan, I forgot that he was coming. If you want to... No, I'm here. How can I help? Well, now that we have our big strong, strapping men, time for heavy lifting. Hey, I was hoping maybe we could talk. Which one of us did you want to talk to? Luke, come on. I'm sorry. I-I feel like, ever since I've gotten here, I've screwed everything up. No, I'm sorry. It's my fault, too. I mean, I never should have left Luke to see you that night. And those things you said before... I didn't... What I said... You were right. We're from two different worlds. I'm glad you're okay. What happened up at that house... I don't want to hear about it. You and I have nothing to say to each other. I don't know who you are or what you're doing here. All I know is you and me we're done. Okay, boys, Ryan, why don't you come with me? New project. Thank you. How dare they? This boy is violent. He's a menace. I mean, they may forgive and forget, but I don't. Who's to say he won't do it again? You're right. You are right. The police are taking criminals off the street, and Sandy Cohen is putting them in my backyard. How does she put up with it? Who? Kirsten? She's never home. She's always working, building her empire, whatever. I feel sorry for her. Dr. Phil did a show on mothers who avoid their home lives by becoming workaholics. It's so sad. I hope she has a vault and keeps her jewels locked up. She has very expensive brooches. Hey, ladies. Care if I join you? Ooh! Mind? So, I couldn't help but overhear. I... Well, I hope that you're not... Mad? Offended? No. I am disappointed. And, frankly, I'm a little surprised. This is a community that welcomes outsiders. I'm all the way from the Bronx. And you're from, what, Riverside, right? Which is not that different from Ryan's ... (cell phone rings) Hello. Yeah. Dawn. That's her. Uh-huh. Good job. Okay, bye. Thanks for the muffin. Can I have a napkin... now? What am I supposed to do with 120,000 pounds of concrete? Get a new mixer. Just call me when you know. What do you do exactly? Real estate or construction? Dude, don't ask. I tried to explain it to Seth once, and he fell asleep halfway through. Okay, but, uh... Yeah, that's pretty much true. Try me. Oh... My dad is in real estate development. He owns the Newport Group. Wow, you guys built the mall, the Pacific Auditorium, baseball stadium, stuff like that. Mm-hmm. And I'm in charge of residential development. So you deal with the contractor, planning and zoning commission. How'd you know? I worked construction. And I used to want to be an architect. What do you want to be now? 17. Me, too. Hey, I thought you were setting up at the, um... You will not believe what Sandy Cohen said to me. He basically called me white trash. He said I was from Riverside. Honey, you are from Riverside. It was his tone. He compared me to that boy who started the fire. Bringing him to our function-- Kirsten is out of control. What, she thinks the rules don't apply to her? How you ever dated that woman I'll never understand. I've a half a mind to call... Leave Kirsten alone. She's the one paying our bills. What are you talking about? You know that... problem I was having at work? Well... she solved it. You went to Kirsten for a handout? Jimmy, how do you think this makes us look? I really wouldn't call it a handout. Oh, really? What would you call it? (sighs) $100,000. That machine ate my change. Okay, okay. That one's always broken. Here you go. Try the next one over. Dawn Atwood? Sandy Cohen, Ryan's attorney. I'd love to talk to you. Can't talk. Stupid thing's stuck. It'll only take a couple minutes. Damn it! How is he? Why don't we grab a cup of coffee and talk about it? There's some great historical homes in the area. We can always go on an architectural tour. Yeah, they're awesome. Yeah, I'd like that. Hey, Ry. Thank you, Rosa. Uh... thanks. No, thank you, Rosa. So, Dawn, how long you been working at the Laundromat? Uh... not long. Just a couple weeks. What happened to the restaurant? Um... they were making cutbacks. You got fired. Well, it was for the best. They had rats, cockroaches. Disgusting. You seen Trey? Uh... went to visit him at the prison. He wouldn't see me. Where are you living these days? With friends. I-I'm between places right now. Why don't you stay here tonight? RYAN: What about A.J.? No. I broke up with him. We're through. No more. I-I put up with too much. He laid his hands on me and Ryan too many times. Mom? What? I-I'm just saying... he was a bad influence, you know... with his drinking and... A.J. was the problem? Hey, I haven't touched a drop since I dumped his sorry ass. The scum he used to bring into the house... his whole coke thing... Where you going? It was bad enough living through it the first time. Ryan, wait, sweetie. I... sorry. Will you at least talk to me? What're you doing here? I-I came... for you. Why? What do you want from me? (sighs) You left a note. A note. Okay. Let me explain. You abandoned me. You threw me out. You just took off. I know, honey. I was... and A.J. and... the drinking, and... It's going to be different now. That's what you said when we moved from Fresno after Dad got arrested. I'm going to be different now. We have a chance to start over, babe. I-I mean, we've never had people like them, you know, who-who wanted to help us. Right. So someone offers you a nice place to stay, and suddenly you're all about the mom thing. I didn't know what I was doing when I married your dad. I was too young when I had your brother. But with you... You were always the smart one. You know? The good one. When you got arrested... I knew I'd failed, and... you were my last hope. I should go. Wait. Are you ever going to forgive me, kiddo? Let's just go slow, huh? Okay. Whatever you want. I'm not going to lose you again. So, where'd they go, anyways? I don't know. Out. Alright. So we'll wait for Happy Hour to end... Seth, we need to be supportive. She seems like she's trying. Yeah, but how do you know? I mean, this woman abandoned him, and now all she has to do is show up? Mom, she should be the one on probation. Not Ryan. What do you want me to do Invite her to stay? Yes, that is exactly what I want you to do (laughing) (sighs) What a beautiful walk. The water's so warm. Not that Ryan would know. You used to love going in the water. Not with all my clothes on. I'm an embarrassment to my son. Welcome to my world. DAWN: Well... we should probably head out soon. Actually, I was thinking. Uh... you just got here, you have nowhere to stay, and, uh, we're all just getting to know each other. We're having a party tonight. Right. Not for me. Thanks, though. Vegas Night. Vegas, huh? Well, it's very kind of you to offer, but no. I don't have anything to wear. Oh, we'll find something. (sighs) -SANDY: Hey! Kirsten does the same thing-- washes the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. I never know whether they're clean or dirty. We never had a dishwasher. So, how's everything going? Okay, I guess. We had a good day. You know, you being with your mother doesn't mean we're not going to still see each other. She really likes it here. She talked about finding some place small, nearby, in the numbered streets. DAWN (sighing): So... How do I look? All their parties like this? Pretty much. (sighing): Well... Let's clean 'em out, kid. Kirsten! Another perfect event. Oh, hi! So... business is good? Yeah, it's good. It's good. I love your dress. You do? It's yours. Uh... Hey! How are you? Hi. Good to see you. Yeah. Would you like a drink? I'd love one. Okay. It's all fabulous, just fabulous! Oh, thank you. How much did you get for the hug? Betting kind of big, Mom? Well, it's for charity. Besides, the count's way positive. You're counting? It's not a single deck. Oh, honey, if I teach you anything in this world the count goes way higher with multiple decks. Blackjack. Oh! Whoo! See, honey? My luck's turning around already. Yes! Is that...? That's beautiful. I told you we could do it. (laughing): I told you, too. Aw, honey. Excuse me? Uh... tonic water and lime, please. (giggling) My boy. Lucky for him, he's got my brains. Go! Have fun... with your friend. I'll be fine. You don't have to baby-sit me. Hey. Hi. So, is that your mom? Yeah. She came back. So I guess that means you're going home. Yeah, I guess. Well, good luck with everything. You, too. Have a nice life. You should go. Hi, Summer. Seth Cohen. I'm superstitious. Blow on these. What? Blow. (screams) My God! Do it again. (screams) You're not going anywhere, Sid. Seth. Whatever. Okay. Blow. You can't just not talk to me. Watch me. It's not like you're totally innocent in all this. I mean, you didn't have to attack him. What was I supposed to do? You left me to go up there for him. It's not like that. It was a mistake. Hell, yeah. Hi, Sandy. Hey, Julie. I came to apologize, and say thank you. The check that you guys gave Jimmy. You never know who your friends until are in need. And we needed that hundred grand. It was our pleasure. You can't take it with you. (giggles) Hi. What do you want? Nothing happened... with Marissa and me. Now, I don't want to talk about it. No, listen. She chose you. You're the one she wants. Can I get a Seven and Seven, please? Nerves. Tough game of poker. Thank you. (sighs) Always does the trick. (screams) You rock, Stanley! Hey. Let's try again. Oh, crap! My damn luck, huh? Well, pony up, honey. Don't be shy. (chuckles) Oh. Ah. My new best friend. Thank you. Mmm! Um, don't you think you've had enough? Oh. You're right. I've just got to learn to celebrate without the sauce. Well, no one said it was going to be easy. Could we talk? It's important. Of course. Excuse us. Sure. You want to hear something so funny? Always. Sandy Cohen had no idea Kirsten wrote you that check. Imagine being so rich you don't tell your husband you're giving away $100,000. Alright, you know what? (clears throat) Who needs chips? You got Kirsten. What did you say to him? You don't even care-- that you went to her. I didn't have any choice. You didn't want to talk about it. I was trying to save us. Our family was in trouble. Looks like we're not the only ones. $100,000? It's more than I make in a year. It's just a loan. Of-of my money. It's not the money. It's that you never told me. I know. I-I don't know why. I've got a couple of ideas, I'll take you on a journey through my neuroses for the past hour or so. Sandy, I promise, it was a loan. There's nothing more to it. He was in trouble. Oh. He could tell no one else. So what's your excuse? Sandy, uh... I don't know what Julie said to you. I'm trying to have a private conversation with my wife. Two Mountain Dews, my good man. Thank you, Ryan. Greatest night ever, it's like one of those nights when the stars and the cosmos and the moon align, and it's just like, wow. Thank you. How's your mom doing? High rolling. She was made for this place. Yeah? Maybe this could work. Yeah? Maybe. SUMMER: Rabbit's foot? Vamanos. Ooh. By the end of the night, she might know my first name. Duty calls. (scoffs): Oh! Look, I'm sorry. (woman laughing) Oh. Hold up. Oh! Oh! (tray clattering) (laughing) Oh, God. What the hell is your problem? What's my problem? What's your problem? Back off! Uh... Ryan, I must have tripped. It's these damn shoes. Oops! (giggles) Hello. Here. Good luck. Dude, that lady is wasted. I bet you could bang her. (laughter) Hey, shut up. Why don't you just quit staring, and help me up, okay? Get me up! Help me up! Finally. Geez! Hey, sorry. Why don't you go get the car? What, you maybe had one too many? Well, I... What are you looking at? Where's Ryan? Hey. Ryan? Thank, buddy. I'm right here, Mom. Ryan, honey, I'm so sorry. I ruined it, huh? It's okay. We're almost there. No. no. You know, I ruined everything, huh? You hate me. No, I don't. I love you, Mom. Uh, it's... it's okay, everyone. Uh, it's just a... it's a little accident. She's with us. (sighs) You mind? Um... So... you caught me. You can't do this. You're his mother. I'm a mess, not a mother. You have a responsibility. I'm being responsible. I-I'm not wired for this. I-I can't care for anybody else. I don't have what you got. The way your husband looks at you. And your kid looks at you. Even my kid... Like, no matter what, you're going to make everything okay. You hold your family together. I... tear mine apart. You can't walk away. Why? This would be the first good thing I ever did for him. And... this way... he ends up with a real mom. Take care of him, okay? He deserves it. (door opening) Thanks. * Opened my eyes * Had a dream last night * That both my arms were broken * * Evening time * Help me now or hold me down * I feel my world is tumbling * Spiraling down... Hey. Hey. Where's, uh... ? Ryan's going to stay with us now. That's awesome. I mean, it's... that's... That-that's awesome, right? That's cool. Um... (clears throat) Let's go talk about stuff. Come on. I'll unpack later. Well, there's a no-return policy now. You know that. I love you. Oh. You know that? Are we okay? Yeah. Good. 'Cause we just got in way over our heads. * The rain comes down like a victory * * In sheets of shining memory... * So then she says, "Blow on these," and, clearly, she's talking about, you know..." * Over and over by paulonline
