 Previously on the OC. You and your daughter want different things. You don't know what she wants! I know what she doesn't. I wanna live with Dad. At least for now. Give me advice in the ways of women. Why're you helping him with Summer? Seth doesn't see me that way. We're friends. Is this all part of the plan? This is a policy-changing, career-making piece of litigation. -My wife's company is the plaintiff. -It's her father's company. -You're going to take this. -It's who you married.

 If your marriage can't survive this, what kinda marriage is it? I wanna make it work... no matter what. (breathing heavily) Ticklish. Sorry. What time do you have? Mm, almost 11:00. What time do you have to be back at your dad's? Mm, soon. (/mumbling/): How soon? Now? You can't call, say you'll be late? I'm already late. (chuckling) It's a school night.

 It's too bad you don't still live next-door. Yeah, but then I'd have to talk to my mom. You haven't talked to her? No. She keeps trying to call me, but there's absolutely no way that I'm... Hey. Sorry. Maybe this weekend we could spend a whole night together. You know, we could go out. We could, uh, do something. Finally have our first official date. No school, no parents, just us. Saturday night? (knocking) Hey, Ryan, Sandy's stuck at the offi... Oh, my God. I'm-I'm so sorry. Hey, Kirsten. Hey, Marissa. I-I didn't know that you had, uh-uh-uh, company. MARISSA: Yeah, well, um, I was just going to go. So, uh, see ya. Later. Good night. Drive safely. This never happened with Seth. (piano and acoustic guitar strumming gentle melody) S01E10 The Perfect Couple California, here we come Right back where we started from * California * California... * Here we come * Oh You walked in on him? Well, at least I knocked. Ryan and Marissa Cooper. I knew it. Didn't I tell you? No. No? Sandy, maybe you should... talk to him? About what? You know. Sex. Oh, sounds like Ryan knows what he's doing. I mean, sex in the house. Right, 'cause we obviously don't believe in that. We don't? Based on my recent experience, or lack thereof, I'd have to say no-- no, we don't. I'm not the one that's coming home from office at midnight. Oh, you're coming home at 11:45. Well, I might be coming home earlier if your firm wasn't suing my company. Well, look, maybe we'll get lucky and settle at the conference tomorrow. Maybe we'll get lucky tonight. Oh... I'd settle for that. What time? How about 8:00? Eh... 9:00? 9:30. If you are not home by 10:00... Yeah? ...I'm starting without you. Oh... RYAN: Morning. Um, hi. We're all very proud. Uh, thanks. And sorry. I just wanted to say... sorry about last night. Sorry about what, man? What did I miss? Maybe you should talk to him? RYAN: I appreciate you guys being so cool about everything. Ryan. Cool about what? So I'll see you tonight. We should get going, too. Hang on, I'm not going anywhere until somebody tells me what happened last night. Mom, would you please fill me in? Mom! I... Oh, I get it. I'm just here for the comic relief. So what exactly did my mom catch you guys doing? Nothing. Nothing, huh? So you guys haven't...? No, we haven't even had our first date yet. Last night doesn't count? No. Going out Saturday night. Good. Great. But you-you have before, right? Okay. Wow, that's what I thought. I just didn't want to jump to conclusions because my experience is sort of limited. And? And what? Was it awesome? Which time? Uh... (stammering) How many... how many times were there? Same girl or different girls? There were... different girls? How many... how many different girls w-were there? (sighs) I have to sit down. So, what happened? I want details. Nothing happened. What's his problem? There is no problem. I just don't know if I'm ready yet. But Luke already took care of that awkward, painful part. Yeah, and look how well that turned out. Look, Ryan and I, we're still getting to know each other. I mean, we're going on our first date Saturday. Well, that should be romantic. Sorry, Coop. It's just what does Chino know about a date? Where he's from, they don't even have a PF Chang's. So when you lost your virginity, I was... I was playing Magic the Gathering. You still play Magic. Yeah, but not as much. Hey. Hey! What are you guys talking about? Nothing. Ryan was just telling me about your-your big date. He's got a whole thing happening. Sounds amazing. Wow, there's a "whole thing happening"? Yeah, but shh- it's a surprise. It's gonna be the best date ever. Okay? I have to go. I'll walk you to bio? I can walk myself. Great, then you can walk me to it. Best date ever, huh? RACHEL: The ecological risk assessment backs up our claim that the land Caleb Nichol is planning to develop should be considered as wetlands. Ah... great, great. We'll get into that tomorrow. And what do you got tonight, a hot date? Yeah. Oh. Sandy Cohen, you are cheating on me-- with your wife. I'm trying. What is it, your anniversary? No, it's just, we haven't seen each other in a while, so we, we thought that we'd... Go on a date. Why not? Good idea. It's not like we have our settlement conference tomorrow where the fate of Orange County's environment hangs in the balance. Alright. The date'll even be better after the conference. Less stress. Dad, good news. Oh! I-I'm sorry, I didn't know you... Julie! Kirsten. Your father and I were just talking about you. This man just single-handedly saved the Children's Hospital benefit. I did no such thing. Oh, he's so modest. I had just lost the Buckley Yacht when he graciously let me host the event on his. The man just gives and gives. (chuckles) I-I didn't know that you were organizing the Children's Hospital benefit. Well, I wasn't going to, but then I thought it's time I stopped dwelling on my own problems and got back to focusing on the needs of others, right? So, must be off. Cal... I owe you big-time. Bye, Kirsten. Bye, Julie. (chuckling) She is something. Isn't she? She's that. You know, you are now the official sponsor of the Julie Cooper comeback tour. It's for charity. Besides, after all the bad press her husband's been getting us, it can't hurt the company to be involved in a good cause. So, what's your good news? We can have that working dinner after all. Sandy canceled your date? They've last-minute prep work to do on the meeting tomorrow. By "they," you mean, Sandy and...? Rachel, yes. And you say she's attractive. Dad... And he got in at midnight? I trust him. You know what they say the only man a girl should trust is her father. They're working together. That's all. I suggest we do the same. I'll see you later. Why you don't just take her to dinner and a movie? It's a classic combination. Because somebody promised her the best date ever. Ryan, I went ahead, and I did a little recon on your behalf. I was extremely stealth, and I spoke to Summer, okay? I asked her what would Marissa want on a date? What would she really enjoy? And she told me she didn't know. How helpful. But Summer's three favorite activities are shopping, tanning and waxing. Maybe there's something there, they're best friends. Use that. And here I thought Summer was superficial. I have no car, no money. Whatever I do, it's just going o disappoint her. What do you usually do on dates? Never actually been on one. Wait, hey, I thought you just told me that you... Yeah, I've hung out with girls. We just never really... went out. Oh, got it. Yeah, I'm going to go to class. I'll keep working on it. Yeah, you've done enough. Bye. Come on. Hey, what do you think Summer's three favorite movies are? Um, Battleship Potemkin, Seventh Seal and Shoah. Definitely. What? Can we just not talk about Summer for five minutes? We talk about her all the time. No, we don't. We talk about all sorts of things all the time. We talk about music. We talk about sailing. What? About how you named your boat after her, made her a burned CD with all your favorite songs with the word "summer" in it. Wow, I'm sorry. I was under the impression that we were friends, who, talk about our-our thoughts and stuff. We are. So, I guess you're finally hearing some of mine. I'm going to go back for dessert. Hey, Dad, I'm... home. Hi, sweetie. What are you doing here? Your mother was in the neighborhood and she thought she'd stop by and see how we're doing. How are we doing, Mom? Marissa, why don't you come here and talk to us? Come on over and sit down. I'm throwing a party. I'm hosting the Children's Hospital benefit this Saturday. They're trying to build a new wing for the children... and I'd love it if you'd both be there. Your father's already agreed. No. No way. Marissa, honey, this party is a chance for us to show the community that we still belong. That we're still a family. Yes, we've suffered some setbacks-- your father's business in particular. But it's important for us to let everybody know the Cooper family is back. Why do you care what other people think? JIMMY: Look, Marissa, no one has fewer nice things to say about your mother than me-- no offense-- but she's been pouring her heart out to me, and I think you're going to want to hear what she has to say. Marissa, I am so sorry for the way I handled things at the hospital. I was scared. And I was wrong. Everything I cared about was falling apart, and I was blaming everybody but myself. I just want us to feel like a family again. Now, I know it's going to take some time, and I'm going to need your help. Will you help me? (knocking) Wow, knocking. It's open. Bad news. I know you had Saturday night all planned but something's come up. Oh, that sucks. We're going to be spending a romantic night on a yacht for this charity event hosted by... my mom. Your mom? Your mom hates me. No, she doesn't hate you. She just doesn't know you. But now she'll have her chance. But we had a date Saturday night. I mean, there was a whole thing happening. I know, but my mom came by today and apologized to me and my dad, and it seems like she's changed. Hey, if my parents got back together and my dad found a job, then my life could go back to normal again. Maybe I should stay away for a while, give you guys... Look, first date stuff: candy, flowers, that's easy. Candy, flowers, right. But it's times like these when a girl needs her boyfriend the most. Boyfriend... Well, I mean... aren't we...? I-I guess. I've just never been a boyfriend before. But you've had girlfriends? Yeah... No, not girlfriends, just girls that, you know, I've... Your mom, Saturday night, I can't wait. Great. The fact is, yes, I admit it, I occasionally talk about Summer. Maybe I even talk about her too much, but it's not really the point, is it? Hi. So get this... Anna thinks all I ever do is talk about Summer. I mean, that's crazy, right? You want me to lie? I'm that guy? Dude, how can I be that guy? I hate that guy. Well, then no wonder Summer doesn't have any interest in me 'cause apparently, all I do... is I talk about Summer. Although, you'd think she'd like that. You're doing it again. Right. Sorry I had to cancel our date last night. What time did you get home? Almost 2:00. Mm. What was the last-minute crisis? As opposing counsel, you know I'm not at liberty to say. Is Rachel's boyfriend as understanding as I am? Rachel doesn't have a boyfriend. Mm, go figure. You know, some people who don't like their life, make work their life. Well, that's not me. And I'll tell you this, if our settlement conference goes well today, I could be home by 6:00. Is that a bribe, Counselor? Uh-huh. Hey! Did you have the talk? I like to lead by example. (laughs) You and Julie Cooper trapped on a boat, huh? Can't wait to see how that one goes. I don't really have a choice... since she's my girlfriend. What? Girlfriend? I thought that you didn't do girlfriends. I mean, you did 'em, but you know what I'm saying. I don't. And this is not a good way to start. At least you'll be there. No, I won't. Who'd I bring? I can't take Summer. Or I could... Do you think she would go? I don't know. I'm doing it again! Yeah. Or you know who you could ask? I could take a friend. Interesting. Okay, I'm never going to mention Summer's name to you again. Except for that. From now on, all you and I are gonna discuss are things that we both have in common, like how do you feel about Newport charity events, huh? I hate them. Me, too. So want to come with me to one? We'll hang out and we'll just quietly mock people. Hmm. Mm-hmm? Is Summer going to be there? I don't know. Who cares? If anything happens between me and Summer, you will not hear about it from me, okay? I promise. On our friendship. Okay. Obviously, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Ecological Risk Assessment asserts that the land adjacent to the wetlands should be considered wetlands as well. Well, why stop there, Counselor? Why not include the land adjacent to the land adjacent to the wetlands? Mr. Nichol, I'm sure your attorney has explained that it's only a matter of time before the state acquires the land by eminent domain. It took the state five years to purchase the Balboa wetlands. Let's cut to the chase, shall we? How much is the land trust offering me for Balboa Heights? Mr. Cohen, I was beginning to wonder about your involvement in all of this. Thank you all for coming. This meeting is adjourned. Where are you going? Well, I mean, that's it? That's your whole dog-and-pony show? I'm disappointed. What have you two been doing? I mean, Kiki tells me that you've been in the office alone together every night till 2:00 in the morning? Feel free to counter, Mr. Nichol. Why is she doing all the talking? Are you just here to insure that your firm makes the early edition again? "Father and son-in-law fight for the Heights." I gotta tell you, I've dealt with a lot of shady characters in my line of work, but I've never seen anyone stoop as low as you. You'll poison anything-- the air, the water, even your daughter's marriage, as long as you profit. You've been living off my profits. If you think I'm bought and paid for... you just wait till I get you on the stand. Don't let my silence here mislead you. I'm taking you down. Counselor. I think I hit a nerve. I forgot I had this dress. Happens to me all the time. My mom bought it for me. Seems appropriate. You know, I think your mom would understand if you told her you didn't want to do this. Except I do. Right, that's what I meant. Marissa, this event is important, and on a yacht, and whenever I got to one of these things somebody gets into a fight. You're going to be fine. (knocking) Ryan, hi. So nice to see you in your room again. You could sleep here tonight if you want. Uh, it's okay. But thanks. Just thought I'd ask. Oh, I love this dress. You remember when we bought it? We had that amazing lunch in Beverly Hills. We saw Catherine Zeta-Jones. Yeah, I remember. So much fun. Well, we should get to the ship and help out. Honey, will you check and see if Caitlin's ready? Uh... okay, sure. So I know that you and I haven't always seen eye-to-eye, but I want to say that I'm sorry. You've been there for Marissa. You really care about her. I see that now. And I'm hoping that this party will be a chance for us to start fresh. A celebration of a new beginning, hmm? I don't really like boats. Please? Okay. Thank you. Hey... Well, let's get to the boat, huh? Come on. The Lit mag won't publish my limericks. That's censorship. Oh... It's censorship. I'll organize a protest immediately. Fine. Something involving a bra burning. Ew. Cohen. Hey. What are you still doing here? Detention. You live a hard life, Summer. There was a Paul Franks sale. I figured that's more important than the fall of the Ming Dynasty. What am I supposed to learn, that opium is gnarly? Right. Because there is no lesson there. Are you making fun of me? 'Cause I can't tell. Oh, most of the time, Summer, you do my job for me. Again, not tracking. I... So, Cohen, I was wondering if you could catch me up in history tomorrow. Uh, I can't until Sunday. I have a charity thing tomorrow. The thing for the Children's Hospital? Yeah. You're going to that? We both are. Mm-hmm. You and her? Me and Anna. Which is my name, by the way. I'm going, too. Hey, well, alright then. I'll see you there. In fact, I'm going with him. Chip... hey. Hey. She's going with him? I don't care. Hey, there's pot roast in the, um... I ate. With Rachel? What was that today? I'm sorry. He just... If you've a problem with Rachel, you should come to me. Sandy, you're never here. Who am I to talk to if I don't to my dad? Seth? We're adults with demanding jobs, you don't go running to your daddy. If that's too hard, go give Jimmy a call. So nice talking to you. Don't ever get married. So, how's everything going with your, uh... relationship? Which I need to talk to you about at some point. Good, I guess. Good. It's just hard. Really? 17 years later, doesn't get any easier. It's her mom, really. In-laws. Mmm. Well, if you figure it out, let me know. Good luck. Thank you. Hey. I'll call you. Hey. Hi. I've just got to, uh, get my good pair of shoes. I know this isn't exactly the date you had planned, but I really appreciate it. You couldn't have done better with my mom yesterday. She's like... a different person. Who knows? I mean, maybe if everything goes well tonight then... I'm really happy, which never used to be an accomplishment. And not just about my parents. We're going to be late. Yo. What up, homes? Chillin' A'ight. What's that smell? Perfume. Smells like wood chips. In a rose garden. Roses. So, this is your crib. This is where all the magic happens? If by magic, you're referring to the card game, then sadly, yes. You have a hot tub Mm-hmm. Do you ever use it? Hot tub's for the hos, I usually hang in the grotto. Hey, guys. Hi! The girls' room, down the hall, right? I got to go, too. Right, 'cause girls can't be alone. (chuckles) What? It's Anna. I could have said "pop a squat" in front of her. Sometimes I think you talk just to make sounds. Well, sometimes I do. So, Anna looks good. Hmm. Tonight should be fun. There's going to be a raffle. The only thing more fun than a raffle is, is anything, really. You guys ready? The girls are, uh, peeing. Seth, don't say pee. Where's Sandy? Don't ask. Question. Hey. Early bird special? I'm going to soldier on. Try to get out of here at a decent hour. Not all of us have cocktail parties to go to on yachts. Right. Um... so Caleb won't sell. No surprise there. On to Plan B. What's Plan B? I'm working on it. Come to the floor, Sandy. Everything makes more sense on the floor. We have got pad Thai on the floor. We got work to do. Which is why we must refuel. You got any dumplings? I'm powerless before dumplings. Go with gravity, man. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. Nice to see you. Hi. You're here! Hey, Mom. How are you doing? Good. Hi, Caity. Hi, Caitlin. Hi, Ryan. Uh, Caitlin doesn't trust new people, but Ryan is very trustworthy. Marissa, sweetheart, Reverend Donahue wants to say hello. Okay, daddy. Can I get a photo of the Cooper family? Totally. That would be great. Come on, let's do it. Jules? Yes, of course. Riviera Magazine. It's very exciting. Ryan, why don't you join us? No. It's for your family. Say "Cheese." Oops. I didn't say "cheese." Hey, Kiki. Hey, Dad. Where's the sandman? Those earrings are hypnotizing me. I know, they're kind of making me seasick. There he is. Built like a pipe cleaner, but looking sharp. Hey. Same-same to you. I don't know what that means. Who's this little firecracker? That's my date. My, my, my friend... Anna. Clearly, she needs no introduction. Very nice to meet you, sir. Seth said you were scary, but I see an inner sweetness. I like your moxey. Suddenly, we're in a film noir. The ocean is like, so vast, like endless. I feel so... Insignificant? Go figure. You know, I'm thirsty. Do you want to go to the bar? Yeah, you can. Yeah, thanks. Excuse me. Hi, Ryan. Good party. Thank you. And thanks for not telling Marissa. She was pretty excited about you maybe getting back together with her dad. You may be okay with lying to Marissa, but not me. This is my life, my daughter. My girlfriend. Ryan, stay out of this. It's none of your business. (laughs) (sighs) Hey, how goes it with Chip? Well, he's surprised that the ocean is big. Smoke another beer, Chip. Wow, someone's in a good mood. What is Seth Cohen doing with Tinkerbell? She's from Pittsburgh. That's like the 909 of the East. Anna's cool. She's a little scammer. First thing she does is go after Caleb Nichol's grandson? Have you seen the way she looks at him? No, but clearly, you have. Well, only because it's like, totally obvious. Yes, it is, that you're jealous. You like Seth Cohen. Oh, no, Coop! You like him, you like him... Stop it. Seriously, stop! I do not like Seth Cohen. I mean, I can't like Seth Cohen. He's like, Seth Cohen. Well, that's too bad, 'cause he likes you. Hey. My parents are totally getting along. And if my dad could find a job soon, then maybe I could be your neighbor again. I could sneak over whenever I wanted... Parents are weird. I wouldn't count on anything. Right. You wouldn't. What does that mean? I'm just saying, if you don't understand how important this is... I get it. I get it, okay? Too well. My mom, my dad... Just 'cause that happened to you doesn't mean it's going to happen to me. My parents may get back together. No. They won't. Why can't you just be happy for me? Your mom is seeing Caleb Nichol. What? What are you talking about? I saw them together, in front of your house. I'm sorry. SANDY: At this point we go to the state for Proposition 50 funds and hope they've got a spare $200 million in the budget. Wait. I have the budget here somewhere. Oh, it's, uh... It's official Alex stuff. Oh, no, you put it with the land trust documents. (laughs) This feels like Twister. You know, when I was in college, that game got me in a lot of trouble. I can imagine. However, you and I, Counselor, are in enough trouble as it is. Yeah. Was it me or did your father-in-law basically accuse us of having an affair? Yeah. Yeah. Where'd he get that idea, right I mean, you know, we work together and we eat all our meals together, and... we talk on the phone when we can't actually be together. I got a boat to catch. Oh, goodness. Look at that piece right there. Get a northeasterly breeze, that toupee's going overboard. Well, good thing his wife has surgically enhanced floatation devices, because then she can jump in after it. Yeah, they're also fun to look at. Do me a favor and go tell that kid puberty started. I don't think that pencil-thin mustache is gonna make a comeback anytime soon. Hey, dude, embrace a razor, alright? Sounds like you're speaking from experience. Well, maybe when I was 13, my nickname used to be Magnum, PI. Oh, really? Yeah. Mothers can be so cruel. God, there are not people like this in Pittsburgh. You must hate Newport. I did, at first... but now, it's growing on me. Are you, um, thirsty at all? Feeling a little bit parched and I think I'm going to go grab a couple Mountain Dews, take the edge off. Sure. Okay. Be right back. Wow. Check it out. It's, like, totally dark, but totally visual. Yeah. Not understanding a word you're saying. Finish 'shrooming, I'm going to go get a drink. Excuse me, I hate to interrupt. Just a moment of your time. I'm Julie Cooper, the coordinator of this event. Thank you all so very much for coming. Through your generous contributions, we've raised almost $200,000 for the Children's Hospital. (/applause/) And don't forget, it's tax-deductible. Hey. Can we talk? Yeah, uh, okay. I have to say that we could not have done any of this without... Let's get out of here. So I should leave, and let her get away with this? Let's give him a big hand. Is that what you would do? Hi. Oh, God. No. Uh, uh, uh, wh-what's happening here? I like Seth Cohen. You, uh, you what, now? Nothing. I wasn't talking to you. But if you tell anyone what you heard here, I'll kill you. There's my beautiful daughter, Marissa. Please join us, honey. (applause) Come join us, honey. (/applause/) Thank you, now I'd like to ask my daughter Caitlin to pick the winner of the romantic getaway raffle. Marissa, would you like to announce the lucky couple? Thanks. And how about another round of applause for my mom? And for Caleb Nichol. After all their work on behalf of the Children's Hospital, if anybody deserves a romantic getaway for two, it's my mom and Caleb Nichol. I mean, aren't they just the perfect couple? They've been keeping their romance a secret, but tonight... the secret's out. Congratulations, you guys. Honey, take this. Don't start with me. Look, after tonight, I'm done with you. You're Caleb's problem now. Jimmy, don't... One more, please. Excuse me. And the winner of tonight's raffle is... Sandy and Kirsten Cohen. (applause) What the hell was that? You lied to me. You said you wanted us to be a family again. I do. I was going to tell you, but this is all new and I know you've been through so much. Marissa, honey, this whole party, this whole night was to show you that our life could be like it was. You could move back home. We could be a family again. And what about Dad? Honey, I will always love your father. But because of what he's done, we have no future together. Neither do we. SETH: Wait, okay. What? Julie Cooper and my grandfather? Well, then, do you know that if that worked out, that'd mean Marissa would be, like... she would be my aunt. I can't believe you missed all the excitement. Where have you been? I find raffles to be extremely upsetting. There's just too much suspense, so I don't go. Um, have you seen Pirates of the Caribbean? I trusted you. I told you things about my life and my marriage, and you used them against me. And you tell me nothing about you. (/sighs/) Well, if this is the way you're going to react, do you blame me? No. In fact, outside the office from now on, we have nothing to say to each other. Oh, and good luck with your new girlfriend. You're going to need it. I'm here. We're leaving. But I wore a jacket. I think this party's over. Do you want me to take you back to your dad's? I think I'm ready for our first date. I think we're way past that now. So, in theory, Julie Cooper could eventually become your stepmother. Don't even say it. I'm late to one event, I miss everything. Well, not everything. We won the raffle. A romantic getaway for two. If you can get away from the office? Oh, yeah. No, it'll be good for us. You know, spend a little time alone. Glad to hear it. So what are you doing now? You. Glad to hear it. (/heavy breathing/) This is a pretty good date. Yeah, I just wish it didn't have to end. It doesn't. Spend the night. We don't have to do anything. We could sleep. Really? Sandy and Kirsten are cool with that? Well, we haven't had the talk yet, so... Do you snore? No. Well, I don't think so. I've never actually slept with someone before. Yeah, me, neither. Usually climbing out the window back into the front seat. Okay, enough sharing. Yeah. Good night. I thought you said you wanted to sleep. Suddenly not so tired. Best... date... ever. by paulonline
