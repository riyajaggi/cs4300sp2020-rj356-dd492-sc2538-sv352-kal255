 Previously on The O.C. You got to have a plan. Yeah. Right. Who are you? I stole a car, crashed it, and then my mom threw me out. Mr. Cohen took me in. You brought him home? What'd you do around here? What do you think of Newport? I could get in less trouble here.

 You have no idea. Shouldn't her boyfriend be doing this? I'm sure they're not doing anything we didn't do. My dad's not here. It's just a thing with a client. Put him down! Hey, Ryan. Welcome to the O.C., bitch. I don't want this kid in my house anymore. * California * California * Is such a wonder that I think I'll stay in bed * * Big-time rollers * Part-time models...

 Guys, come on! Out of the pool! Dinner's almost ready. Dad, I know. I understand how important the model home is to the new development. We'll sell the lots by Christmas, I promise. Okay. Bye. (sighs) I wish there was more we could do. Honey, you're his lawyer, not his guardian. I know. I know, I know. In the morning, I'll take him to Child Services. What kind of mother just abandons her child? What happens if they don't find her? He'll go into the system-- foster care till he's 18. I mean, they'll try and place him, but... at his age, it'll be impossible. You know what I was thinking? I think that, this being your last night and all, we should do something special. I don't know what. Possibly get a couple of tattoos, or some hookers and lose our virginity. Right? Okay, dude, I don't know. There is a shark movie at the IMAX if that's what you're into. I just want to take it easy. Oh. How was your swim? It was great. What's that? It's a model home. I... I build them. Well, the real ones, not that one. Can you build me one? Sorry. Bad joke. Thanks. So... last supper, huh? Sorry. Bad joke. It's just a laugh riot around here. This all looks really good. It's too bad you're leaving. We never eat like this. That's not true. I cook all the time. (scoffs) Dad... I'm sorry, honey. (laughing) Let's just eat. We're not saying we want you to cook more. Oh... Hell, no. You remember the meat loaf incident of '98? That was brisket. Yeah, that's my point exactly. As your attorney, I'll co-sign these forms. They basically say that you don't have a legal parent or a guardian available. So I'm now property of the government. Nickname: 0382965. Hey, it' better than Death-breath Seth. Or so I would imagine. So we'll meet with your social worker in the morning, and, uh, she'll be the one to, uh... to take you to the group home. My contact at Child Services got you a room with only two other kids, which is good, because it can get crowded. Thanks. Appreciate it. And, you know, they do find foster homes for kids your age. Yeah, because everybody wants a brand-new teenager. I'm sorry if I'm the only one here that'll state the obvious. Seth. We have extra room. We have a pool house. Yet you guys are going to ship him off to a group home? Am I the only one who gets how much that sucks? It's okay. Really. Good luck with it. It looks perfect. Goodnight. Goodnight. (piano and acoustic guitar strumming gentle melody) * California, here we come * Right back where we started from * * California * California... * Cal... * Oh Hey. Got a little, uh... PlayStation. Perhaps... uh, are you running away? Go back in the house, Seth. Hey, hey, hey. You can't just run away. What are you thinking? What about, like, Child Services or my dad? Okay, then, wait. Hey, I want to come with you. What I've always wanted to do, besides sail to Tahiti, that whole Kerouac thing-- hit the road, stop at diner to diner-- the pancake tour of North America. No. Fair enough. Where you going? I don't know. New town, get a job somewhere, save some money. Great plan. Sounds like you've given it a lot of thought. You got a better idea? Actually, I do. Seth? (soft knocking) Hey... Can I talk to you? Dad? What? Is it morning? You were asleep? Yeah, I was. What's going on? Well, uh... I wanted to talk about Ryan. I know, it's cool. We don't need to discuss it. Well, I think we... we do. I know you're upset. Your mother and I are upset. But our responsibility is to...is to our family. Yeah, that's okay. No, I get it. This is a person's life, we need to leave it in the hands of the authorities. There's no need for sarcasm. I'm not being sarcastic. Well, it's hard to tell sometimes. Dad... It's okay. Really. When you want to talk about it... Yeah, I know. You're the one to talk to. Got it. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. (door closes) Come on, Seth. Okay, got it. I'll be there in, like, 20 minutes. Hey. Hey. I didn't think I'd see you again. Look, I wanted to say thanks for the other night. You always drink like that? I thought you left. I did. I am. SETH: Ryan. Ryan, we're all set. You ready? Hi, there, Marissa. What are you doing? Nothing. We're just hanging out. Oh, look, it's somebody's birthday. My invitation probably got lost in the mail. It's my friend Summer's birthday. Summer's birthday is not till Wednesday. That's what I heard. I don't know. That was a guess. You guys are up to something. Dude, what did you tell her? I didn't tell her anything. I think the black turtleneck in August tipped her off. Okay. I was going for stealth, and also it's slimming. We should really go. Have fun at your party. You should probably be off. Newport social scene awaits. Oh, yeah? Why won't you tell me where we're going? This is pretty far away. Oh, wow. Complaining. That's very interesting, considering nobody invited you. Before I came along, you were on a skateboard. (groans sarcastically) (music playing) You like them? Yeah, I guess. Well, what do you like? Everything. Well, I don't know. I don't really listen to music. Dude, that's kind of weird. Why? What do you like? Uh, right now... punk. I'm sorry. Avril Lavigne doesn't count as punk. Oh, yeah? Well, what about The Cramps? Stiff Little Fingers? The Clash? Sex Pistols? I listen to the same music as Marissa Cooper? I think I have to kill myself. Listen to punk, huh? I'm angry. That's it right there. MARISSA: Looks scary. Well, then, you can stay in the car. You recognize this place, Ryan? RYAN: This isn't... MARISSA: Where are we? Well, it's one of my mom's house developments. Her and my grandpa own a bunch of them. This is supposed to be the model home, but it never got finished. Why? Did someone die here, now it's haunted? Yes, that's exactly what happened. What did happen? I don't know. How do contractors just disappear? If we don't have a model home, we don't have a new development. It's been a month. I'm not waiting for you guys anymore. You know where to reach me. No luck with the contractors? Vanished. My father's never gonna let me hear the end of this. Did you, uh, did you talk to Seth? (sighs) I think so. But don't blame yourself. I'm not blaming myself. But how can I allow a strange boy to live in this house? Seth needs to know it's what any mother would do. I was talking about the contractors. So you want him to stay here? Well, I mean, I know the place needs some sprucing up, but... God, did I just say "sprucing"? So, Ryan, what do you think? I haven't really had time to think. But how much better is this place than some group home? And wait till you see the best part. (makes eerie sound) It's an empty pool. To some people. So, your mom... I mean, she has to come back, right? I don't know. My mom's... kind of a train wreck. So's mine. Well, I mean, what about your dad? Can you call him? Dad's in jail. Armed robbery. Impressive, huh? (sighs softly) My dad, he's, like, a financial planner. And I think he's in trouble. I don't have any stock tips. He stopped going to the office, these guys keep showing up at the door-- like cops-- but he won't answer. Look, I haven't told anybody about it. I can keep a secret. (cell phone rings) Hey. LUKE: Where you at, girl? It's time for you to get your buzz on. Nolan's so faded, he can't even feel his feet. There goes the left leg. I miss you, babe. You know it's not a party without you. Oh, you're sweet. What's up? You were supposed to be here an hour ago. Okay, I'll be there soon. Say hi to everyone. Alright. Love you. Love you, too. Bye. So how long you been with him? -Luke? Um... I don't know really. -I know. Fifth grade, when you two got your mack on during our class trip to the Museum of Tolerance, back of the bus. Classy lady. You know what? What's your problem, Cohen? What did I ever to do you? Nothing, Marissa. I've lived next door to you forever, and you've never done or said anything to me. Oh, my God. You're the one who never talks to me. You think you're so much better than everyone. I do? Well, if you're talking about Luke, then yes, because that guy shaves his chest! Hmm. He plays water polo. We know. Half the team tried to kill us the other night. I'm not too popular around here, and your boyfriend-- a little bit angry. You're telling me you didn't try to hit him back? Actually, I hit him first. Well, hard to believe you're not more popular. I thought this could be your room. I still don't know if it's a good idea or not. You should stay. Okay... for a little while So when she says it, you listen? (cell phone rings) Hey, Summer. Oh, hey, hey, hey. Is that Summer? Tell her I said happy birthday. Okay. Coop, where are you? We're coming to get you. Oh, no, no, no, don't. I'm coming. Tell her I said happy birthday. Seth Cohen says happy birthday. Who? She says thanks. Uh, look, I got to go. Okay, bye. I got to go meet my friends. My... other... friends. I should get back, too, and protect my cover. But wait, listen. We have to promise not to tell anyone about this place, okay? Now, Ryan's not going to, obviously, and I could get grounded, so that leaves Marissa. I can keep a secret. Okay. See you tomorrow. Me, too. We'll fix this place up. Cool. I'm telling you, Ryan, this plan is foolproof. Ryan? Hey, Ryan, you ready? Okay, the key here is not to panic. Do you have your supplies? Yeah, but there are cops at your house. I mean, do you think it's safe? I'll handle Johnny Law unless... Are you losing your nerve? Meet me in the driveway. OFFICER: He couldn't have gotten far. We'll search the neighborhood. Seth. I was going to get you. We got to talk about Ryan. Oh. Marissa? Look who's here. Luke. Hi. Hey. Mmm! Just grabbing a little grub before we take the boat out. Boat? Yeah. I thought we'd take my dad's DawnSea. Do a little water skiing, have a little lunch. So you have no idea where Ryan might have gone? I don't know. He did say something about going down to Mexico and-and gambling on cockfights. I don't know what kind of jurisdiction you guys... Quit joking around. Will you answer his question? Yes, I did. I really don't know. I do not know the guy. I never got the chance. Hey, there's eggs. Oh, I'm taking Caitlin to the stable, so I need to get that check. Does Caitlin really need a pony? In a couple months, she's not even gonna like horses. What?! I love China. She's the prettiest pony. We're not giving up China. Now go wait in the car, sweetie. Mommy will be right with you. Jimmy, this work is making you so tense. Look, I got, I got to... I've got to talk to you about work. Hey, you know I don't like to talk about work. Yeah, well, I, uh, I've made a... few mistakes, and, uh, I don't, I don't know really... Jimmy, you don't have cancer. No one is dying. Whatever it is, whatever you've done, I'm sure you'll fix it. Can you write that check? I don't want Caitlin to be late. (sighs) Suki is amazing. It doesn't hurt when she's waxing you, and it's really hard to get an appointment with her. Why don't you get a manicure? You could come with me. I mean, they're not just for girls. You go. We'll catch up later. Holly's having a... Holly's having a thing. Perfect. So you tell him anything? No, but if anyone asks, you're Suki. So you didn't tell them anything? Um... actually, I told him that you went to Mexico for cockfights. You know what, though? Even if they don't believe me, they'll never look for you here. Did you seriously bring a loofah? What's a loofah? Hey, you said bring whatever was around the house. But I meant, like, survival supplies like rope or muskets, and not... Kio's cucumber moisturizer. That's a pretty good call. That's nice, yeah. Hey. Here's a little bit of everything. Let your education begin. This place is perfect. Seriously, it's totally safe. Ryan... how perfect is this place, right? Seriously, what else could you need? Anyone bring any food? Food. Guess we're going on a mission. Faster! Go, Ryan! Whoo! (screams) (laughing) Whoo! Well, call me if someone meeting that description comes in. Thank you. Nothing at the hospitals. I'm sure he'll turn up. Not if he's smart. I think Seth knows where he is. Are you accusing him of lying? That'll be really good for your relationship. Let the police handle this. Oh, I wish you hadn't called the police. They don't have the resources or the manpower. Ryan'll just slip through the cracks. Sandy, how many of these cases have you seen? Or passed across your desk? (sighs) What is it about this kid? I thought I could help him... make a difference. I was this kid. If someone hadn't helped me... I wouldn't be here. (cell phone rings) Hello. How are you? I'm good. Listen, I hate to ask, but, um... I-I need your help with something. Uh... of course. China has alopecia. We need to call the vet. Are-are you free for lunch? Um... yeah. I-I have some stuff that I need to do for work, but, uh, lunch sounds great. So, you guys, I've been thinking about a plan. You know, uh, right now this could very well be the first stop on our pancake tour of North America. Hey, like in/On the Road. That's my favorite book. Mine, too. So here's the deal. My mom had this boyfriend. He hired me to work construction last summer. But then they broke up... he moved away... to Austin. In Texas? Said if I was ever out there, look him up, so... I mean, well, that's... really kind of far. We're thinking Long Beach or something, so we can hang out. I'll need a couple days of work to get a bit of travel money. Money? We can get you money. Well, I mean, you know, I guess, in a way, you're kind of lucky. You get to move to a whole new place, start over, be whoever you want to be. That's really not so bad. (laughter) Hey. (laughs)  What's it take to get a menu here? Okay, I'll handle it. I'll handle it. And ruin your popularity? You know what? Why don't you guys just sneak out the back? What's going on with you two? Hey. Mmm! How's it going? Hey. LUKE: How's the manicure...? Oh, it was great. It was really good. Front door. Hey, guys, so I figured we'd roll to Holly's at, like, 9:00? Cool. Sounds good. Awesome. So what'd you guys do today? Whatever. Hi. Hey, guys. How you guys doing? Like the food here? It's awesome. Shut up, queer. (laughter) Well, at least I don't shave my chest. What'd you say? Luke, come on. You look nice in a sweater vest. It was a compliment. Do you want me to break you, Co? Hey. No way.  Look who's back. You know, you're a little far from Eight Mile. MARISSA: Luke, don't! What are you, like, spokesperson for geeks of America or something? (laughs) You know what I like about rich kids? Nothing. (grunts) That was awesome! Let's go! You're dead! You know what I like about rich kids? Bam! Nothing. Hey, Ryan, you wouldn't consider/me/rich, would you? I'd be more upper middle class? What's up, fool? You didn't have to hit him. Sorry. The cashier called the cops. Look, I don't know why Luke does that. Did that. He's just... An ass? Protective. (car approaching) God. It's my mom. And... your dad. It's been a while. Figure out what kind of shape this place is in. Wow. Oh. That's what... Those contractors have been doing. This place is fantastic. You think so? You don't think it's too much? Too much? You're talking to they whose wife just imported ceramic shower-curtain rings from Morocco. It's gorgeous. The high ceilings and the, and the molding. It's, no, it reminds me of, uh... Your parents' house. On Elm Grove. Yeah, with the vaulted ceilings and those great beams, and... Remember that? Yeah. I loved that old house. Yeah. Yeah, I loved that place, too. I had my first kiss there. Me, too. So what's going on, Jimmy? Uh... Well. it's... I've just had a really bad year with the market and, uh... well, it's disastrous. And it's going to be a struggle just to remain solvent... How much do you need? No, it's, it's... it's a lot. It's, it's a lot of money. It's too much. Jimmy. It's $100,000. I'll call the bank. No, thanks. I can't. I can. I-I'll pay you back. But it's gonna take me a couple of months. I know where you live. This place is going to be perfect. I hope so. New contractors come tomorrow. Better get the job finished. New contractors. Sounds like a nightmare. Pretty much. (laughing) You okay? So the contractors start tomorrow. Guess that means I'm gone. One bus ticket to Austin. 8:00 a.m. tomorrow. Would you like to purchase? Hey. Hey. You're not knocking anymore? Sorry. What are you doing? Uh... just busy. You're always busy. That's the price of fame. I gotta go, Dad. They found Ryan. Or spotted someone who meets his description. There was a fight down by the pier. Really? Uh... Which means he's probably still in the area. We should try to find him before the authorities do. Before he gets into any more trouble. Yeah... Do you need me to go? I was going somewhere. Seth. Well... He's your friend. Yeah. Hey. Hey. So what's up? You've been all weird-acting lately. Yeah? I don't know. I guess... It's just... Do you wonder what your life looks like through someone else's eyes? This is what I'm talking about. What is up with you? Nothing. It's just... I mean... Fresh margs! BOY: This is some weak margarita. Whatever. You're the lightweight. Oh, ho, ho! Say it over here. Come here. I hope your parents never come home. Let's find that punk's trailer park and burn it to the ground. Who that?  That freak from Chino. He was all up in Luke's grill. Maybe he's on OxyContin. OxyContin is gnarly. I heard he's, like, a total psycho. He's a little bitch. I see him again, I'm gonna beat his ass. Yeah, run him out of Newport for sure. I gotta go. Alright, hey, wait-wait-wait up. Where you going? I can't be here right now. (groans) What's the matter? You don't know him. You don't know anything about him. He could be anywhere. Dad, I'm sure Ryan's fine. We should just try again when it's light out. Could be too late by then. Yeah, well, maybe he's better off on his own anyways. What does that mean? Okay, if we find him, then what? Then, then if he's very lucky he gets to go back with his mom? I would run away, too. Promise me right now that you never do that-- that you'd never run away-- no matter how bad things may seem. Your mother and I will always be there. Okay, Dad, please, take it down a notch. The minute you were born, I knew that I would never take another easy breath again without knowing you were safe. So I'm like asthma? I'm warning you. You run away... I'm coming with you. I guess we can keep looking. (music playing) This song reminds me of you. I thought you were with Luke. I was. I don't know why I'm here. I just wanted to see you. I mean... you're leaving tomorrow and... what if I never... we never...? Maybe I could spend the night. Just to hang out. You can't stay. If you stay... if-if you spend the night, I... I don't know that I could leave. Well, then don't. You go back to school in fall, and I'll just hang around here? Hiding like some ghost? Till the cops find me and I have to disappear again? We're from different worlds. That's not true. I'm not like you. Go. Please. Go. Hey, Allen. I-I-I'm good. Um... I know it's late, but I need to transfer some money. Sure, I can hold on a sec. (sobbing) (door opening) Seth, I'm up here. You get the bus ticket? Bus ticket? You're not going anywhere. What are you doing here, man? What are you doing with my girlfriend? Nothing. Didn't look like nothing. Tell me. Or I'll kill you. Then kill me and quit talking about it. Dude, this place is on fire! We gotta go! (coughing) Come on, man! (coughing) BOY: Let's go, man! LUKE: Run! I thought basketball season was over. No, this is ESPN Classic. They play all old games. It's the Lakers-Pistons. Right? 1986. The finals. Game seven. You remember watching this. You were pregnant... You were pregnant with Marissa when this was on. I remember. I was so swollen. Ugh! I hated Detroit. Isiah, Laimbeer, Dumars. But-But Worthy... James Worthy, he saved us. Shot the lights out. So fantastic. You know that thing that I was trying to talk to you about? Jimmy... No, I'm just saying that I took care of it. I knew you would. You did? Mm-hmm. I can't believe I'm old enough to watch people play basketball in those shorts. Hey, Marissa. Marissa? Uh-oh. I'll go. Here you go. (knocking on door) Hey. What's the matter? What's the matter? Come on. You can tell me. Hey. Hey... Come here. Give me a hug. Give me a hug. What's the matter, huh? Oh... You can tell me. We tell each other everything. Do we? (cell phone rings) Hello. I'll meet you there. (music playing) Hey. Hi. Hey, Marissa come back? Uh-uh. You smell like smoke. Yeah, we, uh... we hot- boxed Nordlin's car. And didn't invite me? Dude, that kid was messed up. He was breathing. Yeah, I hope so. I can't believe this. This house is cursed. You the owner? Yes, I am. What happened? Not sure yet. But it looks like somebody's been living here. What? It's my fault. You're okay. Disappointed? Where you going? Don't know. We both keep our mouth shut, they may never know it was us. What are you doing? You're giving me a ride. I don't know what happened, why the house burned down. What was he even doing there? Why didn't you tell us? Because he didn't want to go to a foster home. He didn't want to leave, and I didn't want him to leave either. It's, like, you force me to live amongst these- these pod people, and the first cool person I meet, you kick him out. I did the best I could. So did I. Come on. Police want to ask us some more questions. Just follow my lead. You and I need to talk. And this time I want the truth. (car approaches) I'm sorry. Ryan Atwood? We got some questions for you. It was an accident. Yeah? You were there? Yeah. Then we got some questions for you, too. Officer... I'm Mr. Atwood's attorney. Please don't ask him any questions unless I'm present. Ryan... keep your mouth shut. You, too. Sync and Edition by paulonline
