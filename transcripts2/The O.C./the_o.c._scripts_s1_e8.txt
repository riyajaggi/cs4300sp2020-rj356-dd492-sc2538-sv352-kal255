 Previously on The O.C. -You gotta have a plan. -Who are you? I stole a car, my mom threw me out, so Mr. Cohen took me in. -What's with this kid? -I was this kid. -Ryan's gonna stay with us now. -That's awesome. -Wanna do something tonight? -You're not, into him, are you? What are you doing with my girlfriend? Do you know what girls find sexy? Confidence. Might I remind you of something that I call: "The time that you kissed me at my grandfather's party." What are you talking about?

 I never should have broken up with you. -What I should do. -Let me know when you decide. Jimmy's been siphoning money from clients' to cover debts. -Daddy! -Keep feelings for him aside. He's one of my oldest friends. This whole community thinks you're a criminal, Jimmy. -You're getting a divorce. -I'm so sorry, kiddo. -What are you doing? -I didn't know. I'm sorry. -I have no one. -She's gone. -What -So are my stepmom painkillers. Wake up. Wake up. I have three sesame and one plain. I'm okay.

 Look, we're not gonna hear from the hospital for a while. You guys get showered and dressed. And you can't be late for your meeting with the dean. I'll take them to school. You can't be late, for your first day. Well, if we're not gonna eat, let's just go. [Telephone rings] Oh, hey. Hey. She just fell back asleep. But she was awake and aware. Thanks for calling the hospital. And finding her. If they hadn't airlifted her out, she... -When can she go home? -They said in a day or so. -They wanna observe her. -That's hospital policy. So I guess there's no need to worry, right? I mean, a teenage girl palms a dozen painkillers... ...and washes it down with tequila. That's perfectly normal, right? What are you doing here? I called them. What Marissa needs now is to be with her family. No visitors. Well, let's go. We should go. -If you need anything... -Thanks. Don't take it personally. Julie's just been through every parent's nightmare. -I'm sure she'll apologize. -You are? It's Julie Cooper we're talking about. Excuse me. Ryan, can I talk to you for a sec? I don't know what happened in Mexico, but what I do know: Since you showed up, Marissa's been a wreck. Comes home crying, doesn't wanna go to her cotillion... ...having problems with her boyfriend. And now you can add another shining accomplishment... ...to your list of achievements. In addition to stealing cars, burning down houses... ...and befriending would be assassins... ...you've almost killed my daughter. You can blame me all you want... ...but I would never do anything to hurt Marissa. Well, you're not going to get the chance... ...because you're never going to see her again. You even try, and I'll throw you back in juvie, where you belong. (piano and acoustic guitar strumming gentle melody) S01E08 The Rescue * California, here we come * * Right back where we started from * * California * * California...* * Here we come * Oh * I don't get it. Luke is the one she should be blaming. Not you. -She doesn't know that. -Why don't you tell her? I'm just glad Marissa's okay. I'm going to check in with the Events Committee, I'll catch up with you at the dean's office. -Alright. -Ryan, don't be nervous. You're going to do great. -This is school? -Mm-hmm. Ah, registration week, Ryan. It's my favorite time of year because our fellow students aren't around to ruin it. Except them. You guys have tennis courts and a swimming pool? I'm guessing you didn't at your old school? Well, we had a basketball hoop. Oh, hi, guys. Dr. Talley, Miss Camara, how you guys doing? Okay. My mom is more popular than me. That's a little bit pathetic, I realize. Hey, after your meeting, we got to get your photo taken... -...for your school ID. -Another mug shot? If you must be so cynical. Oh, yeah. That one's a keeper. When do we do the retina scan? -Friday. -I was joking. So was I. Good thing we didn't hire you for your quick wit. Well, God doesn't give with two hands. Come on. Time to meet your team. Okay, you'll be assigned a researcher, two paralegals, and a file clerk to do all the heavy lifting for you. Speaking of which, let me show you our state-of-the-art gym. -Oh, you guys have a gym? -You didn't at the PD's office? Well, we had a basketball hoop. Everything's going to be fine. It's just... ...at Chino Hills, you sort of showed up. No essays, interviews, tests. Ryan, the Harbor School is one of the best private... ...prep schools in the country. If you graduate, you can get any college in the UC system. Maybe even an Ivy League. I don't think I'm an Ivy League type. After a year or two here, you will be. -College, huh? -Yeah. What did you get? Uh, AP History, English, Calculus... ...and Physics and French IV. Good thing I don't have a life. What is wrong? Are you nervous? Seth, would you please tell Ryan that Dr. Kim is very nice? Oh, yeah, she is sweet. -Kirsten, how are you? -Hi. Nice to see you. Good to see you. Seth, always interesting to see you. And you must be Ryan. Why don't we step into my office? Well, this doesn't suck. That eloquence will serve you nicely on the stand. Like you guys ever actually go to trial. You're one of us now, Sandy. Better start wrapping your head around it. So, is your family all excited about your first day? My wife loves being married to a corporate sellout. Right, right, right, right-- wrapping my head around it. You got to be kidding me. Yeah. I figured you'd want to dive right in. Chemical peel gone awry-- fascinating. Bad Botox injection. -Noise complaint on a yacht. -Scintillating? In the purest sense of the word. -Don't be a snob. -Just defend them. Right. Rich people need lawyers, too. Weak grades, truancy, a notation regarding... ...some criminal activity.. It was a misdemeanor. Probation. Nonetheless, not exactly Harbor School material. Dr. Kim, Ryan's had a lot to overcome. Sandy and I feel that, in the right environment, he could really excel. There's no doubt that Mr. Atwood has extraordinary promise. I'm just concerned that he has not had adequate preparation... ...for the rigors of our curriculum. Or are you concerned about the pressure from parents... ...who don't want Ryan here? That's definitely a consideration, but not a decisive one. Kirsten, you know as well as I do... ...how bright and motivated our students are. Those that aren't bred for USC go off to Harvard and Yale. I just think a place like Newport Union... ...might be a better fit for a student with Ryan's background. My background? I can't change where I'm from, but I can change where I'm going. Ryan, you understand that, if you did fail, you would lose a year, not to mention self-confidence. With all due respect, Dr. Kim, if you think not letting me in is going to inspire self-confidence... Give me a shot. You got great test scores. I definitely responded to your personal essay. Your grades are borderline, but acceptable. If you could pass a placement exam. It's not an aptitude test. It measures your preparedness-- what you've learned, not how bright you are. Just tell me where and when. Summer. -Hey. -Hi. (sighing) It is so weird being in school right now, surrounded by all these people who have, like, no idea. I know. Have you talked to Marissa? I spoke to her mom. You? We went by this morning, but she was sleeping. I think she's going to be okay, though. I still can't believe it, you know? -I thought she was dead. -Me, too. Well, when she's feeling better, we'll, um... we'll take her out and cheer her up. Take her to a movie, or... Six Flags. I don't know. Yeah... I guess. Maybe before then, if you want, uh, me and you could go see a movie. You know... something. GIRL 1: Hey, Summer. GIRL 2: Hey, Summer, how's it going? Hey, guys. Look, Cohen, this year's all messed up. I mean, Marissa's in the hospital, I'll never speak to Luke or Holly again... -You and I... -No, I get it, it's fine. We're back in school now. Old rules apply. Sorry. Strong sedative, huh? Yeah, she needs to sleep. And we need to talk. Look, um, Jimmy... you and I-- we need to present a united front. It's hard enough, this forcing us to be in the same room. Thanks Jules, got a great bedside manner. Calling the Cohens this morning was completely inappropriate. You know I don't like that Brian. -Ryan. -I don't want him near Marissa. Marissa said it was an accident, okay? There's no one to blame. That's a convenient position to take, considering you're the one who let her go to Tijuana. Oh, so, uh, now it's my fault? You're the one who destroyed this family, Jimmy. You lied to us. You stole money from your clients and your friends. Why do you think she took all those pills? Oh... You cannot honestly believe that. I left her in your care for one weekend, and look what happened. Which is why I'm asking the judge for sole custody. Julie, come on. You can't. Getting them away from you is the only chance to give them back... ...some semblance of a life. And, if you fight me on this, I'll take you to court, and you'll be lucky if you even get supervised visitation. Well, you're gonna have to, I'm not giving up my kids. You may not have a choice. I'm going back to check on Kaitlin and the sitter. You should get cleaned up. You're a wreck. (sighs) It's a good thing I never throw anything away. The questions'll be different, you get the idea. That I'm going to fail. Hey, no, you're not going to fail, okay? You have to get in. I'll not spend another year at school alone. Please? Thank you. Study. Especially, though, if all it takes... ...is a couple of cheerleaders walking by, and suddenly, it's like, "Mmm, Summer and I, we just... we just didn't happen." Sorry. You study. Here's the thing, though, Ryan. We connected, right? We connected, and it was awesome. Especially the part where she kissed me. I do believe I... I have two hours until I take this test. Unless you plan on attending Newport Union High with me... Right. Got it. Less talking, more studying. (phone rings) Don't move. I'm gonna get that. You keep studying. Hello. Hey, Marissa. Hi. Um... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Sure. Hi. O-Okay. Alright, um... Okay, I'll be there. Alright. She's upset. Something with her parents. And her mom's going home for a little while, so... -What about the test? -I'll be there. I'll have to do the best I can. Not to bum you out, what if that's not good enough? Well, then Dr. Kim was right. I'm not Harbor School material. (sighs) Hi. Hi. This is for you. Uh... It's all they had left at the gift shop. I'll just, uh... I'm sorry. I was so dumb. What I did... Hey, hey, hey. Come on. (sighs) I didn't want to kill myself. I didn't. I just wanted to...escape. I know. JULIE: Excuse me, Nurse? When you get a chance? Lunch, please. You should... Oh, sweetie, you're awake. How you feeling? Your sister sends her love. My throat hurts. It's because they had to pump your stomach, honey. Where did that thing come from? Uh... I... I don't know. It's from him. He came here, didn't he? After I told him not to? After everything he's done ... He didn't. It... it wasn't his fault. Honey, you keep saying that but, before he got here, you were happy. You think I was happy? If you weren't, you never told me. -I tried, but... -I need to talk to the nurse. The security in here is appalling. I'm sorry about that. You know, about her. It's okay. I should go, and take this test, but I'll be back first chance I get. I don't know. With my mom... -Aw... -I'm not afraid of your mom. Well, I am. Did you ask Ryan what he wants for lunch? He doesn't want to eat. He's on a diet. -Why is he on a diet? -Why is he on a diet? I'm going to ask him, because I want to see how he's doing on his... Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom... uh, he's in a state of deep, deep Zen-like concentration right now. Well, he still needs to eat. He's naked, alright? He's naked. He studies in the nude. It's a Chino thing, okay? I think if you were to walk in on him, naked, and Dad was to find out, I think suspicions might be raised. A house divided will not stand. (doorbell rings) You and I still need to talk about your little surprise trip to Tijuana. Okay. I can't wait. Jimmy, hi. Is Marissa okay? Yeah, she's doing better. Thanks. Uh, it's Julie who's giving me the problem. Is Sandy coming home for lunch? Uh, no. He just started a new job today. Why? What's going on? Oh, she's suing me for sole custody, maybe even supervised visits. -Why would she do that? -Well, my question is: Can she? I need to know what kind of shot I have at joint custody, given what I've put my family through. I want to know what kind of case she has. Come on in. I'll get Sandy's new number. I'll just, uh... I'll wait out here. I mean... you know? Jimmy... we have been friends for too long... ...to let something like this... It was just a... It was stupid. It was... it was... it was monumentally... stupid, and I'm so... (sighing): I'm sorry. It's okay. I mean, it's-it's not okay, but it's-it's okay. I mean, you and Sandy are the only friends I have left. -I don't want to lose you. -You won't. (sighs) So, are you coming in or what? Hi. You've reached Jimmy Cooper. I'm not in right now, but please leave a message, and I'll get back... Security said they'd do what they can, but I don't know. This is exactly why I thought San Diego would be good for you. -San Diego? -Dr. Burke has a facility there. Who's Dr. Burke? Oh, well, uh... she's a psychiatrist-- highly recommended. She runs an institute for young women who are troubled. You're sending me to a mental institution. It's a recovery center. Oh, honey, I know you don't understand, but... I would rather have you hate me now... ...than risk losing you again. Does Dad know about this? Well, I think some time away from your father... ...would be good for you, too. Well, what if I don't want to go? That's for Dr. Burke to decide. She'll be here after lunch to evaluate you. Please, honey, just talk to her. Let her help you. Then we can get you out of here, and you can start to get better. Yeah. If it's okay, I just need to use the bathroom. Of course. Mm-hmm. (knocking on door) Not now, Mom. I'm studying naked. Ew! Summer? Come in. No way. -I'm not naked. -No, no, no, no, no! Okay. I don't get it. What kind of family do you have, Cohen? The kind where mothers and sons wear clothes. Always, even in the shower. (chuckles) What... is this? I don't know. Never seen it before. -Uh-huh. What's its name? -I don't know. Captain Oats. What are you doing here? (sighs) Coop just called. She's freaking out. Her mom's threatening to ship her off to the insane asylum. -Really? -Yeah, I'm serious. I've got to do something, Cohen. I need to get radical. -I need Ryan. -You can't have him. He's taking a placement exam. What's wrong with me, though? Am I not radical enough? Well, that depends. Are you ready to take on Julie Cooper? We need Ryan. (whispers): Yeah. -That's my bed. -Okay. -Just wanted you to know. -Uh-huh. -I have a feeling... -Okay, let's go. SANDY: No, it's a very fair offer, given the merits of the case. Okay. Well, think it over. Good-bye. My wife does that thing with the hands... ...when she's really pissed off at me. Your wife and I have a lot in common. You've been here half a day, and you've booked court dates... ...for five of the seven cases you were assigned. Do I win the free set of steak knives? Sandy, this isn't how they do things around here. And I could keep this off the partners' radar for now, but you got to understand... Understand what? I'm going to court. I'm taking them on, I'm bringing them down. Especially this bastard who won't let his neighbor... ...grow his hedges over his own fence. Look, you know how much time and energy goes into trying these. Yeah. If you settled, you could handle twice as many cases, and we're in volume business here. Like Costco. Look, you know, I thought the whole reason you brought me... ...here is 'cause you wanted a trial attorney, you know, who was committed and passionate and blah, blah. Yes, and when one of these cases actually deserves... ...to go before a jury, the courtroom is all yours. But, in the meantime, I need you to pick up the phone... ...and passionately negotiate some settlements. Come on. I put my ass on the line to get you this gig. Please? Do it for me. Hey. What are you guys doing? Dr. Kim's coming back. I know this isn't the best time, but we-- Marissa-- needs you. -Just... -Her mom's gone psycho. She's having her committed. KIM: What is going on here? -Hi, Dr. Kim. This is not what it looks like, but there's an emergency. SUMMER: We need to borrow Ryan. KIM: Ryan is not going anywhere. You two, out! Out now! -There's kind of an emergency... -Good-bye! Good-bye. We'll be out here. -Actually, I gotta go, too. -Have you finished the test? No, but I... Ryan, if this is too difficult, tell me. If the Cohens're pressuring you to go to this school... It's not difficult, and they're not. Then prove it. Sit down. Finish the test. I can't. If this is the commitment you plan to bring... ...to your studies at the Harbor School... I don't have time to argue right now. There is no argument. You walk away from this test, you walk away from the school. You're probably right. It wouldn't have worked out anyway. Sorry for wasting your time. Let's go. So your mother tells me you struggled with anorexia in the ninth grade. My mom's convinced it was anorexia. It was just tennis season. I was really stressed. That's all. And in tenth grade, you were caught shoplifting? It was just a lighter and a pack of cigarettes. Do you still smoke? Not really. Drink? Would you say you drink a lot? I guess. I mean, what's "a lot"? Have you ever had so much to drink that you blacked out? Tell me about this past year. Your dad's legal troubles, the bankruptcy, your parents separating. Home's probably the last place you want to be, right? Your mom mentioned a boyfriend. Luke? He's not my boyfriend anymore. Really? You want to tell me what happened? Anything I say you're just going to use against me... ...to prove to my mom that I'm troubled, right? I'm not here to judge. I'm here to listen and try to help. You're here because my mom would rather have me shipped off... ..to a mental institution than have to deal with reality. I'm here because, accidentally or not, you nearly killed yourself. You want to tell me what's actually going on... ...with you and your mom? How much time do you have? (sighs) This isn't good, man. Summer should have been here by now. She better be here soon. Well, what if something happened, right? Marissa's dad can't get her out of here. How're we supposed to be able to? I'm done waiting for Summer. Hi. We're here for Marissa Cooper. Uh... it's okay, Denise. They're with me. Good... Lord. What? I told you I was a Candy Striper. I thought you were kidding. It's for charity. All the girls do it. I should be hospitalized more. If you need any help... Okay, can you get us in the psych ward or not? -Just try to keep up with me. -Cool. Seth, You're on lookout. Hi, Gloria. I know it's my day off, I just can't get enough of sick people. These guys're gonna help with the sponge baths. Hmm! Dibs on that guy. I'm not saying that we need to keep her on suicide watch, but there are some underlying issues... ...she hasn't been dealing with. But you can help her? I can recommend further treatment. Psychodynamic therapy, group work. At the institute? At the institute or here in Newport. I see patients or I can refer you. No, no, I want her to get out of Newport. It's too chaotic here. She can't leave now. She's got school. She's got her friends. Uprooting her now would do more harm than good. She almost died, Jimmy. How much more harm can she do? Alright, you decide. I need to check in with the institute. JIMMY: Thanks. She's going to the institute. -She's not going anywhere. -Don't make me call my lawyer. (sighs) Go ahead. I'll call mine. I'm going to go talk to Marissa. Excuse me, Doctor. Marissa's father and I have discussed it. I've got a bag for her in the car, I can drive her down tonight. I'll make the arrangements. Thank you. (tapping phone keys) I know this may be difficult for you to hear, but Dr. Burke and I think it's for the best. Well, what about Dad? He wants what's best for you, too, sweetie. Now, Dr. Burke and I have to finish some paperwork, so you should get dressed, okay? I'm glad you're taking this so well, Marissa. Yeah, well, if it's for the best, right? Mm-hmm. I love you, honey. Okay. Get dressed. I'll be back. Alright. How'd I do? Almost had me convinced. Here. It's, uh... Summer's idea. It's for our, uh, cover. Sure. Summer's idea. Hey, no peeking. Hey.Madame Bovary. (admiring whistle) That Flaubert could really turn a phrase. I guess. It was kind of a bummer. I mean, I know Emma got her heart, like, totally broken, but why'd she have to go and eat arsenic? -You've read Madame Bovary? -Five times. It's Tom Shell's favorite book. Ooh, I should go check on him. He's two floors down. He's, like, incontinent. You're a strange and mysterious woman, Summer. (Summer gasps) -You... -Shh! Okay, wait... What does that mean. I wasn't in Panama. That means that you should... Just go, I'll run interference. Yeah, that's what I said. 10-4. (sighs) Hi, Mrs. Cooper. How are you? Hey, Summer. Are you here to see Marissa? Uh, yeah, well, I was just volunteering today. I thought I'd stop by. How is she? Well, she's going to be fine eventually. -Are you her doctor? -I'm her therapist. Now we're on way to see her right... Therapist?! Do you have a second? Because I keep having this dream, while I'm in the woods trying to find this restaurant, but I'm totally lost and so hungry. I have a reservation so I can't be late. Are you following? You ready? Yeah. -Go away. -I just wanted to see you. I'm-I'm so sorry about everything. Yeah, that's what you said in Mexico. -That was a mistake. -No kidding. What are you doing dressed like that? Oh, uh, hey, your mom and the doctor are on the move. You're running away? Look, Luke, please... Take the stairs. Are you sure it's okay? I mean, I don't want to interrupt if... His office said he was having "welcome to the firm" drinks... -..with a few of his... -Thank you. ...associates. -Can I have another one? -Sure KIRSTEN: Hey. SANDY: Mmm! Hey, hey, hey, wh-what are you two doing here? When I couldn't reach you on your cell phone, I called the office. Jimmy needs some legal advice. I'm Kirsten. Hi. I'm Rachel. -Oh, so this is Rachel? -This is Rachel. I'm Rachel. (all chuckling) Hi, Rachel. I'm-I'm, uh, Jimmy. Hi. So, are you suing a tequila company? Doing some research? Well, apparently, we don't sue anybody. Now, you say that like it's a bad thing. You're lucky to be married to somebody so hilarious. I am. (giggling) JIMMY: You know what? Um... (clears throat) I-I'll just take care of this myself. -I'm gonna go. -Jimmy... -Stop by the office tomorrow. -Uh, yeah, no. Tomorrow's, uh, going to be too late. Thanks, Kirsten. I'll see you at home when you're finished work. -It was nice to meet you. -Yeah. Hey, Dad. What... what are you doing here? I, uh... I checked out. Does your mother know about this? We're going to wait in the car. Yeah, yeah, right. You ran away? I didn't know what else to do. Sweetheart... Mom was ready to drive me down to San Diego. What? You didn't know? Oh, I should have guessed. Look, I don't want to go to San Diego, and I don't want to live with Mom. I want to stay with you. I want that, too. But I... I don't know... I don't know if that's possible. Your mom is suing me for sole custody, and after everything I've done, she kind of has me... ...over a barrel, kiddo. Look, if I do even the slightest thing wrong, I could never see you again. Okay? And I don't, I don't ever want to lose you. (phone rings) Hold on. Um, it's just, give me a second, okay? -Yeah. -Hey. Yeah, fine. Uh, no, she's, uh, she's here. I didn't have anything to do with this, Julie. Well... you were going to take her to San Diego... ...without telling me about it. Alright, great. I'll, I'll keep her here. What do you want to do now, Coop? -I don't know what to do. -What can I do? I could hide you in one of my mom's developments. -I'm kidding. -Mm-hmm. I mean, how is any of this even possible? My mom wants to lock me up in an asylum, my dad can't even do anything about it. Well, we'll figure something out. We better hurry because she just escaped... ...from a psych ward wearing a candy striper outfit. If they didn't think she was crazy before... Sorry, Coop. I'm going to go get another slice. As will I. Well...if you want to skip town, I guess I could go with you. My mom would love that. Look, if your mom's doing all this... ...just to keep me away from you... I'll stay away. I don't want that. So, what are we going to do? If I could just get her to listen... -Hey. -Back from work? I don't understand why you're so upset. I understand, but it's nothing. She works at the firm. She doesn't look old enough to be served in a bar. -Let alone a lawyer. -She's 33. She graduated Berkeley four years after you. -What's her favorite color? -Pink. (sighs) Aw, Kirsten... Sandy, I'm not saying anything's going on. Good. Because you spent the weekend painting Jimmy Cooper's house, and I didn't say a word because I knew nothing was going on. Right? Right. Of course. So what were you two doing together tonight? Jimmy's got custody issues with Julie. Well, I guess we're all having issues. So what are we going to do? I have to work with this woman. I trust you. Okay. I trust you. Okay. (phone rings) Hello. Hey. It's Ryan. Hey. What's going on? Uh.... I'm with Marissa and... I need your advice. Uh-huh. Well, if I've learned anything today, you don't want to go to court with this. You're going to want to settle. (doorbell chimes) What is going on? Come with me. I don't understand. What does this have to do with Marissa? Do you know where she...? Well, no surprise you're involved in all this. Where is she? I don't know. At a bus station. On a tropical island somewhere. Ryan... I cannot believe you're chaperoning this farce. -Julie, sit down. -No. I don't want to sit down. Alright. Let's all talk. Talk about what? What is there to talk about? Well, if you ever want to see your daughter... Watch it. Julie, I... I know you've been through a lot. But Ryan isn't the problem. What is that supposed to mean? You tell me where she is, and then I am taking her home. -She ran away from a hospital! -She ran away from you. Look... you're from Riverside, right? That's not too far from where I grew up. I am calling the police in, like, two seconds... I know this place has everything we never had. You're afraid you're gonna lose it all, everything you wanted. I'm done. What you and your daughter want are different things. -You don't know what she wants! -I know what she doesn't want. She doesn't want to go to San Diego. She doesn't want to live with you. I don't know what I'm supposed to say to any of this. Just say "Yes." -Oh, honey... -No, no. You don't mean that. Yes, I do. Look, I know you're only trying to help, but you're just making everything worse. You have no idea how scared I was. I'm sorry. But, look, I'm not going to hurt myself again, and I'll even still see a therapist if you want, but I want to do it here. And I want to live with Dad. I mean, at least for now. This isn't over, Marissa. I'll let myself out. You okay? So you still think that, after everything... ...that happened today, when we get back to school, you're going to be able to ignore me? Well... all I can do is try. I admire your will. Hey. Hey. How'd it go? Uh... it's over. Yeah? Summer, you should take Marissa home. To her dad's. Bye, Summer. Just a little thing we do. Okay. Now let's talk about that surprise trip to Tiajuana. It's pronounced "Tia-who-ana." That's how. You're so white. I've never heard you talk so much. I like to save it for when it counts. Good. I heard about what happened with your test today. Or what didn't happen. Well, you're suddenly not so talkative. Look, I get it. Marissa needed help; you were worried about her. Believe me, I understand. I'm worried about you. Aw... I'm okay going to public school. Be a hell of a lot better than where I went. Go to Dr. Kim and explain yourself. I don't think she wants to hear from me. Ever again. Ooh, you're afraid of her. You, who went toe-to-toe with Julie Cooper, the Dragon Lady-- You can take Dr. Kim. Talk to her. There's a problem... you'll have your attorney present. I got your back. So you and Summer seemed pretty chummy yesterday. Dad... "Chummy"? -It's okay. You can tell me. -No, I really... I can't. If you can't tell your dad, who can you tell? Gee, I don't know, uh, Ryan, Mom... that tree over there. You're going to miss me when I'm gone. When are you leaving? -What's the verdict? -He passed, he did very well. -Congratulations. -Congratulations. -Dude, you're a Pirate. -You guys are the Pirates? Yeah, I know, it's a bit minty. Yeah. Thank you for giving Ryan another chance. Mr. Cohen, I told Ryan that if he ever pulls a stunt like that again, he's going to need a much better lawyer than you... ...to get him out of it. Welcome to the Harbor School, Ryan. I'll be watching you. Argh! You thought juvie was tough. Hey, you ready to get your photo taken for student ID? Like a mug shot? So cynical. Hey, check out my new mug shot. -God! -What? Dad, those eyebrows are out of control. It's a sign of power. Then you must be the most powerful man in the world. Yeah, well, brace yourself, son. It's genetic. by paulonline
