 On Thanksgiving Day, Ryan ventures to his hometown in Chino to help his imprisoned brother, Trey, with some business he has, while Marissa tags along with Ryan to get a look at the neighborhood where he was born and raised, but it brings out some bad situations and unpleasant trips down memory lane for Ryan. Back in Newport, Kristen invites Caleb and Julie over for Thanksgiving dinner where Seth takes the player role of playing both Summer and Anna. But he does not play it well, leading to both of the girls running into each other and learning about Seth's two-timing act.

 Previously on the O.C.: Where's my brother? Trey's looking at three to five years. You like Seth Cohen. I can't like Seth Cohen. If you tell anyone, I'll kill you. CAL: What've you two been doing? Kiki tells me you've been in office alone together every night until 2:00 in the morning? MARISSA: Aren't they the perfect couple? They've been keeping their romance a secret. But tonight...

 the secret's out. Mom, Mom-- no, no recipes. Put them away. This is Ryan's first Thanksgiving in the house, and we're gonna do this as a family. Okay, seriously, where's Rosa? No Rosa. Just us. I, for one, am ready for this challenge. Dad, the take-out menus. Sandy? You sure you want to do this, honey? Mom, no, no. We're not ruining Thanksgiving. Who said we are? I wait for this event every year, Mom. Please. Thanksgiving is my favorite. It's my favorite holiday. Everyone knows this. My family was never really into the holidays.

 KIRSTEN: All the more reason to make this special. Are there pans? Are there any pans anywhere? You're not inspiring a lotta confidence. You know what I dream about. When I dream about Thanksgiving, which is often? I dream about eating so much deliciousness that all the blood rushes to my stomach, and I pass out at the table. Please don't deny me that. That's just weird. Well, I guess we should start with the turkey. Uh... um... Do I...? Aww... that's just how she held you as a baby. Sandy! Um... I guess we should just, um, start basting? I'll tell you what-- I'll baste. That's a good idea. Well, are you sure? Oh, I love to baste. You know that. Okay. Well, next up is cranberry sauce. Uh, I got it. I'm a big fan of cranberry. I'll peel the potatoes. You know what though? There are few things as therapeutic as peeling a potato. I'm sorry. So what am I supposed to do? Set the table. Yeah. Setting the table is important. ( phone ringing ) How about I get the phone? Or you can answer the phone. It's not gonna answer itself. You own the phone. Hello. Yeah. I'll accept the charges. Uh, yeah, he's, uh, he's right here. H-Hold on a second. Uh, Ryan, it's your brother. I'm just going to, uh... He's, uh... he's calling from jail. He's gonna be there for a while. He's got an impressive record. Hey, did you ever meet him? No. I've gotten used to Ryan in the family. You just kind of forget that he has one of his own. Hi, bro. Good, you? What, today? It's... it's Thanksgiving, Trey. No, yeah, I know, it's been a long time, it's just... Isn't Mom going to see you? Okay. No. I want to see you, too. It's been too long, so... You, too. Bye. How's Trey? Okay. He was hoping I could visit him. Holidays-- he doesn't want to be alone. Can you blame him? KIRSTEN: So, are you, uh... are you going to go? Well, it's only an hour away. I could help out here, go down, be back by dinner. Oh, great. That'll be great. Get to see your brother. ( piano and acoustic guitar strumming gentle melody ) S01E11 The Homecoming * California, here we come * Right back where we started from * * California * California... * Cal... * Oh. People actually make stuffing? What did you think? I didn't. You should probably be heading out soon. I got to finish the stuffing. Then there's the gravy and the candied yams. Yeah, and if you find enough cooking to last three to five years, then Trey will be out. He's just going to want something from me-- a favor, money. Maybe he wants to see his family on Thanksgiving. You don't know Trey. I know, you never talk about him. Well, not a lot to talk about. Well, he's your brother. If you want, I-I'll go with you. I'd like to meet him. No, you wouldn't. Well, legally, Ryan, we're all like brothers now, so I... Someone's gonna 've to keep your mom away from the food. Besides, you've got Anna coming over. Yes, I do. KIRSTEN: You think Ryan's okay? I think he'll be okay. He needs to do this. Okay, let me get in there, do some flipping. No, no, no, honey, honey, Seth really likes corn. How do you expect me to get better? I don't. I'm sorry, but the boys and I made a pact. A pact? A solemn promise. When? You were in the bathroom. Look, I'm all for you expanding your horizons, but not today, we have guests, who-who expect that food will actually be served. Speaking of which, did you tell Rachel about Jimmy? No. Did you tell Jimmy about Rachel? No. He's freaked out enough. First Thanksgiving without his wife. Well, I'll bet he'll have less indigestion this year, unlike your father, who will probably be in agony. I can't believe he is having Thanksgiving with Julie Cooper. 'Cause he's never had it with us. No complaint here. Mom, come on. You're uncomfortably close to the corn right now. Please, can we back up a little bit? MARISSA: I should've just gone with Caitlin to Grandma's. Because I really don't want to go to Mom's. I know, kiddo, but just for an hour. Why do we have to spend Thanksgiving with him? He's creepy. Caleb's not creepy, he's just... He's just... ...scary. He's dating Mom. I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm well aware. Well, isn't that weird for you? Look, your mom is... she's... she's moving on. But you know what, I got news for you-- so is your dad. Really? Well... not exactly. I mean, you know, there's the fraud charges and the whole bankruptcy thing and you know, I don't even have a job, so I'm not exactly a catch, but, uh... feel free to disagree. Look, I know it's weird, alright, but your mom is still your mom. She loves you. Mm-hmm. Come on. Alright, got to get on the road. Give me one second. Trey doesn't even read comics. Yeah, he doesn't yet, but that's because he hasn't seen the New Titans. Titans? What about Legion? That was kind of cooler. The guy is in prison, man. Have you seen Oz? I'm sure that will be fine. But, yeah, the New Legion is cooler. Hey, hey, hey, hey. ( coughs ) Easy on my eau de toilette, please. Since when did you start wearing cologne? I'm-I'm-I'm sorry for trying to step it up a notch. Since today. Oh right, 'cause Anna's coming over. What? Uh... no. Why would you...? I mean, why would you even... Where... Uh... Anna? Are you totally...? I don't... I don't... I don't... I couldn't... no. You like her. No. What makes you even think that? What's the problem? She's cool. She's into you. Okay. I need to ask your advice on something, but yo've to promise me... that you will not tell anybody, okay? Promise. Promise. The other night, on my grandfather's yacht, Summer attacked me with her lips. And she swore if I told anyone, she'd kill me. She's got an interesting take on romance. Yeah. Yeah, so the first 16 years of my life, I have no women, now I have two. Yeah. Yeah, I feel really bad for you. Oh, hey, thanks, buddy. Seriously man, tough, tough problem to have. I liked it so much better when you had no sense of humor. ( doorbell rings ) Happy Thanksgiving. Hi. Welcome. Good to see you. Hi. Happy Thanksgiving. You look nice. Thank you. Hi. Just wanted to stop by before I went to my mom's, see if you wanted to talk. Your pool house or mine? JIMMY: It's a twist-off, so that's classy, right? You've outdone yourself. Oh, yeah. So, Thanksgiving. Big day. Excited? Yeah. Yeah. New shirt? Uh, I guess. Yeah, it's... it's a tuck-in. Apparently. KIRSTEN: And you wore your hair like, uh... like this? ( stammering ): Yeah, I mean, I wasn't aware that I... Do I wear my hai any way? I mean... What, uh, what's going on? Isn't, uh... it's just us, right? Hey, I'm a fan of the tuck-in. And your hair looks good. Mm. I got to go. My mom's waiting. Okay. I'll be back in, like, an hour. Right. I should be back by 8:00. Where you going? To see my brother. Oh, I thought he was at... He is... but he called. He just wants me to drive down to visit him. You want company? No, it's okay. You don't want to, uh... No, I want to see where you're from. Where you lived. You should be with your mom. I feel like you have this whole life I don't know anything about. It's better that way. No. It's not. Yes, it is. Look, it's... it's not my life anymore. So, what does it matter, right? ( doorbell rings ) Rachel. Hi. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving. Thank you. That was so sweet. Oh, sure. Hi. Thanks for coming. Sure. Well... so this is the, uh, the-the summer cottage? The... for weekend getaways? Ah, that means "nice house" in Rachel. Hey. Hi. Um, I'm Jimmy. We met. Yeah, at La Rocha. Right. Right. Great. Jimmy, Rachel. Hey, w-why don't you both have a seat? Okay. ( Rachel clears throat ) ( chuckles ) Okay, well, uh, I have to check on something in the kitchen. As do I. ( laughs ) Oh, we suck. That was not very smooth. I told you this was a bad idea. No, you didn't. I don't want to know, don't care. Okay, so I'm going to take off. Hey... Just in case, why don't you take this? Are you alright? Yeah, yeah. Do you want anyone to go with you? No, no, I'm okay. Okay, uh, well, um, you should take the keys, and, uh, I have a little something for Trey. Don't worry, it's store-bought. Nice. Hey, later on, buddy. Alright. Ooh. What? Too much? Ooh. Ooh! Seriously, did I... did I put too much on? Did you guys hear that Ryan's funny now? ( weak laugh ) What are you doing? I'm coming with you. My mom said it was okay. She did? Yeah, well, she's trying to stay on my good side these days. Ah, I don't know. I do. Thanks. Hey, little brother. Hi. This is Marissa. Hi. It's good to see you, man. Uh, you know what? You guys talk. I'll, uh... I'll just be over here. Look at you, man. Sorry I haven't come by to see you. You've been busy. Mom said you'd done pretty good for yourself. How you been? You know. Not so good. What do you need? Don't say it like that, man. Can't I just see you on Thanksgiving? You tell me. Hey, forget about it, alright? I didn't want to have to call you, but... I'm in trouble. When we got arrested, I owed some people a lot of money. Money that I lost-- like, six grand. How'd you lose six grand? I'm an Atwood, bro. You know our luck. The people that I owe it to, they got friends in here that like to remind me about it. It's only going to get worse. I don't have that kind of money. I'm not asking you for the money. So what are you asking me for? You can't tell me where we're going? The bus station. You're going home. What? Ryan... I have to pick up a stolen car, okay? That I have to drop off at some chop shop to pay back a debt. A stolen car? Now you know why you're not coming. But if you get caught... He's my brother. If I don't do this... I've got no choice, okay? Me, either. I'm not leaving you. KIRSTEN: Can you believe Seth has a girl coming over? I know. How can I help? Hi. You must be Anna. Sandy Cohen. Nice to meet you. Uh, we're doing fine. We're just, uh, working away. Okay. If, by "we," you're referring to yourself, then somebody violated the pact. I'm merely opening the wine-- a skill I feel very confident about. No argument here. So, Anna, what's the deal? Huh? Your parents don't believe in celebrating the genocide of the American Indian? Hardly. They went back to Pittsburgh to have dinner. Oh, you didn't want to go? Uh... no. It's kind of challenging to sit at a table with the Sterns of Pittsburgh and still have an appetite. It's sort of an anathema to the whole spirit of Thanksgiving. Yes. Hey. Sweet potatoes and marshmallows and Corn Flakes. Suddenly... suddenly not so hungry. Well, then, all you'll be eating are your words. Seth, a little help, please? ( water running ) You're trying to set me up with Jimmy Cooper. Oh, that's crazy. Yes, it is. The man is a white-collar criminal. But a nice one. How desperate do you think I am? Don't answer that. Look, Jimmy's a good guy. He's a thief. And you're a lawyer. It's a perfect match. Hmm. You don't want to deal with what's going on between us. There is nothing going on between us. You know that. We're coworkers. We're friends. That's it. Jimmy's cool, he's funny, he's attractive. It's not happening, Sandy. Okay, admit it. Admit what? This whole thing is a... is a setup. Should I use orange candles or brown candles? Just say it. ( sports program playing on TV ) Hey. Hey. Um... Yeah, I-I didn't know about the... you know, the... Oh, me, neither. Okay. I just wanted... wanted to make that... Good. ...clear. Good. Okay. Okay. Oh, come on. Break that tackle, baby. Yes. Oh, no. Kill him. Kill him! Hit him. Hit him! He... could... go... all... the... way! Oh, man. Who-hoo-hoo-hoo! ANNOUNCER: Touchdown! Dolphins fan. Huge. What are you? You're a Cowboys fan? Obsessed. Oh. We've got a game here. Yeah, we do. Want a taste? I don't want it. No. 'Cause it... Why not? It's two-week-old gravy. It's really good. It's not. I just made it. This game is ridiculous. Do you ever watch ESPN Classics? Oh, my God. I love ESPN Classics. Something about it, you know... it's so... Soothing. Yes. It's so soothing. Yes. It's totally soothing. Totally. I don't know what that is. ( doorbell rings ) Ah! The gruesome twosome. That means, uh... "Happy Thanksgiving" in Sandy. Our caterer's truck broke down with our Thanksgiving feast. I wanted to tell Marissa that we're going out to eat. Except that she's not here. Or we could just eat here. You don't mind, do you, Kiki? No. Why would I mind? Football's on. I forgot. Cal, please. Make yourself at home. Why not? It's mine. JULIE: Well, I don't understand. If Marissa's not here, where is she? With Ryan? Uh... he went home. He left this morning. Julie. Jimmy. Rachel. Uh-huh. Rachel. Jimmy. What's the score? So this is your old neighborhood. * So you'd sing a lullaby * Ryan Atwood. Theresa. Hi. Arturo in? You're just going to ask for my stupid brother? You're not gonna tell me where the hell you been for the last five months? Uh... no. Yeah. Uh, uh... Who's this? Hi. I'm Marissa Cooper. So this is your new girlfriend? Oh. So you two were... Off and on. We grew up together. I was the girl next-door. So am I. Yeah. Arturo? I think he's here. I'll explain later. Uh-huh. Mom. Look who I found. Ryan! Where've you been? I haven't seen your mom in a while. Yeah, me, neither. And your brother? That's kind of why I'm here. So, you're here for the car? Hey, man. Hey, man, how you been? This is Marissa. Hey. Hi. His girlfriend. Come on, man, let's go. Might take us a minute to get the engine going. Yeah. You, uh, you want to come? You go. I'll hang out here. You can help us cook. Great. Mom, don't ask her to help. I'm sure she doesn't cook. She's got maids for that. I don't know where she is, Julie. So you lost her? She's supposed to be at your house. You lost her. Ooh, third and long. Big play. ( whispers ): They can't stay. I know. Julie's gonna blow our whole Jimmy-Rachel thing. All our hard work for nothing. Who does he think he is? Oh, you're leaving? Well, it was good to see you. Hey, Seth, how are you? Hey there, Gramps. You remember Anna? How can I forget? Alright. Kiki, I know you're upset with me. Perhaps we should talk. It's okay, Dad. I-I-I'm not upset with you anymore. No talk needed. Not so fast. Mr. Nichol, you own the Heights, right? The property above the wetlands? Not you, too? No. I was just wondering, how do you feel about building a huge development that'll only pollute and destroy hallowed ground? That's quite a message you're sending to the youth Cal. Has she read my report? Is she aware of the estuary we just announced we're building? Oh, everybody knows that doesn't go far enough. It's a Band-Aid for a bullet wound. Oh, really? Really. ( doorbell rings ) Oh, tell you what, I'll get that. Summer. Uh, hi. What-what are you doing here? Um, trying to have Thanksgiving. I was supposed to meet Marissa, Yeah? 'cause there was no way I was eating with my stepmom. Why does she need tryptophan? She's on Valium. Yeah. Some of the Coopers are here, but I-I don't know where Marissa is. Well, while I'm here, maybe we should talk. Yes, what should we talk about? About what didn't happen on the yacht. Oh. So are you going to invite me in? Uh... yeah. You know what, why don't we discuss this in the pool house? 'Cause that's going to work for me. Also, let's go around front because we put some new gardenias on the lawn. I think you'll be impressed with them. I want to show you. Huh. It's weird, 'cause-'cause they said those gardenias should have been in bloom by, like, Thanksgiving. Hey... Hey, what's going on? I just can't help it. Uh-huh. And I certainly can't explain it. You didn't tell anyone? No, of course not. 'Cause I'll kill you. No, I believe you. Could you do me a favor and wait, because I've got green beans that I need to check. You're passing me up for beans? ( chuckling ): No. Is this Ryan? You mean Snoopy? That's from the eighth grade musical, You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown. Therese was Peppermint Patty. And Ryan was Snoopy? He was so talented. Ryan did musicals. He quit when we got to high school. Wow, that's a really pretty dress. Yeah. That's when me and Ryan went to the winter dance together. That was a crazy night. We used to get in all kinds of trouble. He just left, you know that? He was there one day, next day his house was empty. I don't think he planned any of it. He could have called. You know someone your whole life, you grow up next to them. I guess I didn't know him at all. This car's hot, man. Gatas will be psyched. Your brother must owe him a lot of money. That dude's crazier than your brother is. Yeah. So why you back here doing Trey's bitch work? Look, Trey was my best friend, but the guy is trouble. I noticed. You don't have to do this. You could just go back to your new life. What's Trey going to do? Let's just get this thing running. You've been trying to get him to come to Thanksgiving for years. The only reason why he is here is because his food didn't show up and the game's on. You know, you might want to slow down with that. You're drinking on an empty stomach. Don't you tell me. Tell him to hit the bricks. "Hit the bricks"? Who talks like that? Don't you judge me. I have a family that won't let me cook for Thanksgiving dinner. I have a father who is using me for my candied yams, and we are out of Merlot. Do you want some privacy? Oh. I'll just... Hi. Anna. Why, hello there. Where you been? Ah... Hmm? No. Ryan just asked me to feed his sea monkeys while he was away. Ryan has sea monkeys? I love those things. Yeah, but you know what, though? You can't see them because they're dead. Oh. Yeah. Suicide. You know how hard the holidays can be, so... Well, um... the pool house is empty. Maybe we could take some alone time to hang out... Yeah. away from everybody. Yeah, let's do that. Let's do that in my room. Even better. Alright. Huh. So... this is your bedroom? Yes. Yes, it is. Hmm. Have you met Captain Oats yet? I don't think you have. Huh? ( sputters lips ) Seth... ...you didn't bring me here to introduce me to Captain Oats. No, I didn't. That's what I thought. I have cauliflower... steaming, so what I'm going to do, is I'm going to leave you here with Captain Oats to get acquainted and I'll be right back, okay? Thank you. So, the car's ready to go. ( cell phone rings ) Hello? SETH: Man, it's me, listen. Now, despite what the Penthouse letters might suggest-- two girls and one guy-- No, it's not really all it's cracked up to be. I know what you mean. Can I call you back when Marissa and I are out? Marissa's with you? Yeah, why? Uh, just... her mom's here looking for her, but just call me... call me back, okay? Yeah. ( whirring ) Hey, so, Marissa is with Ryan. What?! I said... I said Marissa is in Chino. I can't hear you. I said Marissa is in Chino! Wow, that actually happens in real life. What? What did you say? Yeah, no, I said that Marissa has my chinos. I love those pants. Looks like we'll be here a while. You ready to talk? Fresh margs? So... I'll see you again. Mm-hmm. Good luck. Yeah, you, too. And you know... sorry. Me, too. This place isn't as fun as it used to be. So how come you didn't tell me there was a Theresa? How come you didn't tell me about your mom? You're going to put this on me, too? I didn't put anything on you. Who do you think she's going to blame? I'll explain it to her. I never should've brought you here. You're not doing this alone. Are you my wheel man? Just go back to Newport, I'll take a bus. Ryan... This is not a conversation. You lied to me. What is up with this shirt, Cohen? Is it, like, childproof? Alright, well... why don't you let me do it? Cool. Way to take charge, Cohen. What, do I have lipstick on my mouth? No. Uh... no. ( laughing ): What? This is happening. Wait... Wait, what do you... what do you mean, this is happening? No, no, no, no, no. Cohen, no. Ow! No, you know what? Th-This can't be happening. Yes, it can. It just was. I was just expressing awe and delight, which now will be replaced with a severe bruise on my ass. Okay, I need to think... or eat something. I'm feeling-- can we go inside? No. Actually, um, I think that it's best, then, if I go inside, because I'm the host, and I bring food to you, and I think that's the polite thing to do. Also, you probably don't wanna go now 'cause my mom's cooking, and that's something nobody should witness. My dad, he's wearing an apron, so that falls into the same category. And my grandpa's talking about politics in there. Nobody likes politics, not when he talks about it. And it's pretty tense, and you don't wanna get all tensed out, so stay here where the relaxation is. I'll be right back. ( sighs ) This is your fault, because you allowed her to go with Ryan. I had no idea she was doing this. Well, that's encouraging. What father doesn't know what his daughter's up to? Oh, you're not serious? I may be anything but never a bad parent. Destroyer of the environment. Tyrannical land baron. You stay out of this. Don't know what you're doing here. Oh, she's our guest, unlike some people. Oh, so suddenly you have standards about who you let into this house. What does that mean? Marissa wouldn't be in Chino if she hadn't met Ryan. Ryan's not the problem. Right, it's the overzealous tree-hugger that brought him in. Or the irresponsible parent who's too busy trying to get laid on Thanksgiving. Excuse me for making up for lost time. "Well, excuse me"? Sorry, it was the heat of passion. Don't expect that to happen very often. Oh, people, please, feel free to share. Does anyone want another drink? Seth, would you run back out to the pool house...? Can't, Pop, I got to go. Hey, Anna. What's up? I'm beating Captain Oats at Jenga. I think it's his lack of opposable thumbs that gives me a certain advantage. It's getting a little weird in here. Well, you left me alone for so long, I guess I was going a little... crazy. You know, Captain Oats is a sore loser, anyway. Mm-hmm. Did I mention to you that Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday? Well, it is. ( giggles ) Aren't you kind of hot in this? Mmm, yes, it is rather balmy. Mm? Why don't you take it off? Why don't we? I was never a fan of it anyways. My mom picked it out, and I was, like, "Mom..." Oh, wait, that's not true, I dress myself, that's not true. I got it. Pull this up... Let go of my head. Don't worry about it. ( laughs ) Whoa! Oh... Seth. Okay, that's two bruises today. Two? Yeah, the... first one was from cooking. The sweet potatoes just aren't as sweet as they used to be anymore. Speaking of which, I've left them unattended. I'm very neglectful, so I'll be right back, what is that, Captain Oats? He wants a rematch. Do that. You want a rematch? Back so soon? 'Cause I was just.... Ew! Uh... uh... I mean, not "ew." You're very attractive. For a dad. Uh, distinguished, but... Oh, my God. ( door closes ) You Ryan? This is a hot ride, I'll tell you that. Hard to believe your brother could pull it off. 'Cause, uh, he's such a stupid son of a bitch. Yeah, well, what do you think? What, huh? What? What do I think about what? We good? You take the car, Trey's off the hook. Oh. Is that the deal? That's what he told me. Huh. You fellas hear that? I've been waiting six months for this, alright? And there's something called interest. I don't have anything. Yeah, well, interest needs to be paid! ( horn honks ) What the...? Go! What the hell are you doing? I followed you. ( panting ) Good idea. ( several shouting at once ) When was the last time that we spent Thanksgiving together? I've my work, you know that. ...a family, Jimmy, and don't act so innocent. I know, Dad, but it's not like I planned this, okay? I get it-- I mean, it's a difficult position to be in. You got Anna, who's so smart, and so funny. And very funny. She's adorable, but... Summer is... Summer. Yeah. ( shouting continues ) You can't lead these girls on. No, right, I know I can't. Be a man-- tell Anna you like Summer. Right you are. Except, well.. Oh. Okay. Well, then... tell Summer... you like Anna. Yeah, again, not so sure. Uh... something's burning. Guys, guys, I hate to interrupt you, but there's, um... Oh, my God, my turkey. ( gasping and groaning ) ( coughing ) Come on, Mom. ( beeping ) Where are the take-out menus? Oh! Is everything okay? Everything's fine. Let me meet you back upstairs. I thought I heard a smoke alarm. Summer? Anna? SUMMER/ANNA: Seth?! Holy awkward. This is weird. I want to explain everything to you guys. I kissed you. I know. I kissed you. So true. I always knew you were a late bloomer, sweetie. Thanks, Mom. Anna, will you not go, please? You don't want her to go? No. No? I mean yes. I mean, yes. SUMMER: Nice. That was awkward with her here now. Finally she's gone. Let me tell you something, Summer, I've... I don't feel very good. ( groans ) RYAN: The car is delivered, your debt's paid... but I am never doing anything for you again, you understand? I'm sorry, man. I could've been arrested or killed. I know. And I also know that no one else would have done this for me. But I get it. We're done. Well, I'll come back to see you. Don't. You've got a chance, little brother. You've got to leave me behind. Leave all this behind. Take care of yourself. Yeah. Well, you should jet. You got people waiting for you. * Yes, I had a dream I * Stood beneath an orange sky * With my brother standing by * With my brother standing by * I said, brother, you know... So, that was Chino. ( sighs ) I guess I never realized, when you left, you left people behind. I never want to do that again. You won't have to.
