 That's my money-- kids' tuition. Sorry! You son of a bitch! Daddy. Sorry! I just need to be alone right now. (pop music playing) What are we doing in front of this tank? Ryan, we're like two samurai, really, and we need to have respect for each other before meeting in battle. And eating lobster is a battle, as you will soon learn. Is that a new shirt? Yeah. Your mom bought me some new clothes,

 which she didn't have to. Because we all know you get lot of mileage out of a tank top. Speaking of which, you think I could pull off the wife-beater? You know, switch up my look? Gotcha. You got your style, I got mine. Yeah. You're dead. That was amazing. A lot of work, but amazing. So, what's going on with you and Marissa? Did you talk to her? I don't think she wants to talk. Everything with her and her dad-- it's just... You know what your problem is-- and I speak from experience, with great authority here-- is that you really need to be aggressive, okay? Her and Luke-- they're broken up, which means you should go after her. Tell her how you feel. What do we do? Where do we go? I have no car, no money. Got it. I picked up a couple of extra sailing lessons this week. Feeling a little bit flush. (sighs) Not you, too. I can't keep doing this. Since your parents took me in, they've been paying everything. I can't keep taking. They're parents. They work for us. They're your parents. They're your guardians. It's the same principle. Okay, what are you gonna do for cash, then? MAN: Get outta here! You can't fire me. I quit! Fine, but you're hooking me up with free lobster. (piano and acoustic guitar strumming gentle melody) S01E05 The Outsider This actually works out good for me you starting the new job-- because now I'm going to have time to do all I haven't since you moved here. Like, I'm gonna get to start my novel. I'll be back by 6:00. Yeah, I know. It's 9:00 now, which means I'm going to have nine hours of me time. You know what I'm saying? For me, Ryan. I'm going to do stuff like learn Chinese, study my Talmud. Know what I mean? Sink my teeth into it. You gonna be okay? Before you moved here, all I did was hang out by myself anyway so it's a return to form. Should we not go? Maybe we could tell Julie we're not going and go anyway. You guys, that's too mean. We can't do that. Can we, Kirsten? Absolutely not. We've had this retreat on the books now for months, and Julie's looking forward to it. Yeah, and some of us were looking forward to retiring early, before our husbands stole our money. Uh... Dad? What are you doing, man? I'm waiting for them to disperse. I...I left my briefcase in there. I...I need to get to work. Well, go get it. And talk to those women? I can't. He didn't steal. It wasn't like... She's our friend. I can't believe you're defending them. Jimmy Cooper's a thief and a felon. Those women are obsessed. Are you kidding? A scandal this big in a town this small. They'll be dining out on this for months. What are their kids gonna do? I mean, with their father in prison. Think he's going to jail? I heard ten to 20. Is that true? Jimmy stole a lot of money from a lot of powerful people. What's Marissa going to do without her dad? I don't want to go. I have to go. Trip's already been paid for. Besides, I don't show up, those women will spend the entire weekend gossiping about me. You're being a little paranoid. Oh, no, I'm not. I'm sure they probably think I masterminded this whole debacle. Honey, they're your friends. Please. They're the gatekeepers of this entire community. Community your daughters and I would like to remain a part of. My one chance to go before the firing squad and plead for a stay of execution. Well, I was hoping to be able to talk this weekend. This is your mess, Jimmy. You clean it up. When I get back, we'll figure out what the hell we're gonna tell our girls. SUMMER: Ugh! I'm totally crispy. Let's go do something. Shopping, get exfoliated, anything. I'll pay for it how? My dad's credit cards got shut off yesterday. Well, what about Luke? I mean, he can pay for you. He is your boyfriend, right? I don't know. (sighs) We left things kinda up in the air. You haven't talked to him since cotillion? Haven't talked to anyone except you. Okay, Coop, this is so not the way to handle this. I mean, you're gonna become depressed, and then you're gonna need medication, and then you're gonna stop feeling, like, anything. According to my step-mom. Uh-huh. Come on, let me buy you lunch. My dad gave me his credit card in case of emergencies, and, well, this is an emergency. (laughter) Okay. Alright, I'm gonna give you the rundown. This is garbage. It belongs in the garbage. This... belongs over here. And, uh, now for the advanced class. Hello, Mrs. Palmer. How are you today? Would you like another glass of merlot? Coming right up. Drunk. You been working here long? Oh, man, too long. Everybody comes in here's freak show. They like their $30 entrees on plastic plates, $60 bottles of wine in plastic cups, and their service with a big smile. ~Welcome to Newport, ~where things only appear to be casual. Of course, living here does have its upside. Hey. Hey. First day on the job. Oh. Wow. Well, the food here is... really good. Yeah. How's your dad? He's okay. How are you? SUMMER: Coop, starving. I should get back to work. Right. You want to hang out sometime? Go out? Like on a date? Not a date. Uh, just... I can't right now. No. Of course. Right. But thanks. See ya. Hey, Jimmy. How's it going? Aw... (laughs) Never better. Listen, I was thinking. How would you like some free legal advice? You want to be my lawyer? How long do you want to send me away for? I got too big an ego for that. Yeah, well, that's true. No. I wouldn't be representing you. I've got a friend who's a securities attorney. But I could help you put together a case. Why would you do that? You...you don't even like me. I'm a public defender. I represent a lot people I don't like. Wish somebody had told me he worked here now. Why? No reason. Oh. What do you know? Luke. What a coincidence. You invited him? Got to pee. See ya. Wait. Summer. Hey, man. (laughs) Hey, babe. Hey. I hate that kid, man. I...I seriously hate that kid. He walks in here like he owns the place. Let me tell you something. That Abercrombie & Fitch water polo-playing bitch wouldn't last two minutes in Corona. You from Corona? Yeah, man. Chino. Chino? That's a long way from home. Place is no joke, man. So, I'm sorry I haven't called you back. Oh. No. No worries. We don't have to talk about it. Maybe we should talk about it. Why? Talking about stuff's just gonna get us all bummed out. Let's... let's just do something. These Newport kids must make you sick, too. Sounds like you're a fan. I like the surf, I like the tips... love the girls. Plus, it's not all like this, man. There's some real people around here. Oh, yeah? I'll tell you what. Later, I'll show you what I'm talking about. Cool? Cool. Holly's beach house. Party. I don't really want to. Why not? It's weird. I mean, her dad beat up mine at my debutante ball. Yeah, well, you can't blame Holly for that. I mean, your dad stole all their mon... Nice. Normally, we don't tip out the trainees, but, uh, you did good, man. Thanks. Alright, now you buy me a beer. I'm gonna go grab my sweatshirt. Alright. Hey, what's up? Craziest thing, uh... just happened. I was in the neighborhood. Checked my watch. It's 6:00. Figured, come by, and celebrate your first day on the job. Yeah... So, kid you ready? Yeah. I actually... made other plans. This is Donny. He grew up in the town next to me. Donny, Seth. What's up, man? Wow. Hey. What's up? Well, then... Wow. You guys must have some catching up to do. We got some girls we gotta catch up with. The, uh... The blonde's a dancer. Ah, yes, the ladies. I feel ya. Well, uh, do you wanna... ? Donny, is it cool... ? No, no, no, no. Please, no. You guys, go. I... 'Cause I have the... I was going to do stuff. Donny, it was really good to meet you. Alright, man. Let's go, son. Yup. See ya. So then, I'll just see you at home. Uh, tomorrow, or tonight. Just, I don't know. Just go. You sure you don't wanna...? No, no. Just... Alright. Okay. Have fun. What are you reading? The new Legion came out Wednesday. It's Part Two of five. I liked Part One. I'll let you borrow it when I'm done. Thanks. How was last night? Fun. Cool. That's cool that, you know... met someone that's where you're from. You know, it's, it's just cool. I know he's not the most sensitive guy in the world. No one wants to see you with Luke more than me but what you're going through right now is gnarly. Luke's a boy. Maybe he can't handle it. Is it bad to burn on top of a peel? Uh...yeah. Put 30 on. Coop, your life will stabilize. Your parents will work it out. Your mom will go away this weekend, they'll miss each other, they'll have make-up sex. Ew! Summer! God! It's true. (chuckling) Marissa. Hi. Heading to the office. Yeah. Me, too. You know what...? I was just thinking... When I asked if you wanted to hang out, I was asking you out. I know. I wanted to clear that up 'cause I'm gonna ask you out again. Want to do something tonight? I have to baby-sit for Caitlin. But I will be cooking. Macaroni and cheese-- it's my specialty. So that's a yes? Alright. Won't these costs be covered by Chapter 11? Well, filing for bankruptcy isn't going to make this thing go away. The U.S. Attorney's office is involved in this now. They'll push for fraud, unauthorized transactions... So they fine me, I go back to work, and make it all back. $4 million. Unless you plan on going to the track and getting lucky... Look, if you don't wanna do this... You're going to lose your Series 7 license. It's important you understand the predicament you're in. Look... I get it from my wife every day. My daughters won't talk to me, I got my ass kicked in front of everyone at the most elegant event of the year. I get it, okay, man? I-I-I definitely understand. Well, look, you know, we're both tired. Maybe we should take a break. Go out. Wh-what do you want to do? Well, our wives are away for the weekend. We could... Well, what did we do before we got married? Put that thing away, Kirsten. Oh, I'm sorry. We put a new bid on a development, and the counteroffer is outrageous. We're here to relax. Just because you have a job... She's lucky she has a career. Well, I mean, it's not luck. You're a very hard worker. God knows I could use my own income right about now. Let's just say it. I better enjoy the weekend 'cause I won't be back for some time. Don't say that. It's not true. Jules, tell me, did you have any idea about any of it? How would I have known? (rueful chuckle) We have a deal. My domain is the kitchen and the bedroom. His is the office. I held up my end of the bargain. You poor thing. Believe me, if I'd known anything, I would have taken my girls out. It's them I'm concerned about. Having to live with the shame of what your father's done. Maybe we shouldn't talk about this. Oh, no, I don't mind. I mean, to be honest, I blame myself. I feel like I should have known. Like I should have sensed it. How could you? You had no idea. You can't beat yourself up. You're a victim. You're right. I know. It's just... What else can I do? I have the name of a great attorney. Oh, a good attorney could really help Jimmy. It's for Julie-- to divorce his sorry ass. Girls, this isn't helping Julie relax. Isn't that why we're here? Kirsten's right. I mean, you wouldn't get a divorce. Would you? (sighing) Hey. Hi. How do you feel about a little thing that I like to call... the IMAX experience? This town sucks, the best I could do. Uh... I can't. I'm hanging out with Marissa tonight. So, we'll get a third ticket. I really don't think it's gonna be sold out. Well, she's got her sister. Fine. Four tickets, then. I like Caitlin; she's nice, and she's smart for a fifth-grader. Actually, I, uh... was going to go over there. Help her... baby-sit. Oh. Nice-- the baby-sit. I see. Stepping it up, taking it to the next level. I can respect that. Donny, I'm gonna leave in a minute. Alright, man, I'm out of here, too. Can't believe we survived this shift. I'm so hung over, man. What are you going to do now? I got plans. Alright, man. I have an extra ticket to the IMAX, Donny. It's a shark movie-- hammerheads-- very violent. Shark movie? What are you, eight? You got a better idea? I got a house party in Long Beach. Six kegs, crazy honeys... Okay, yes, that is better. Want to come? Uh... is that... is that cool? Uh, let me just change out. Alright. I do enjoy the crazy honeys. You're not going. (cracks up) Okay, Mom, except that I am. It's a shady neighborhood. It's pretty hard-core up there. Dude, it's Long Beach, not Chechnya. Seth, guys like Donny-- you don't exactly know them, and they don't exactly know... kids like you. I shouldn't wear my ascot and talk about Grey Poupon? How you gonna get there? Got mom's Range Rover. I'll park it up the street. Look, man, Donny is a good guy, right? He's cool, right? So, then maybe this way we can all be friends. We can all hang out. You boys game, or what? Yeah, man. We'll go for one hour. Do you know how long it's been since I've had a steak? I live with three vegetarians. You know how long it's been since we had beer in the house? I am sick of Chardonnay and Merlot. Cheers. Cheers. (phone ringing) You wanna grab that? These are almost done. Oh, yeah. Hello. Jimmy? Did I dial your number? No, no, no, I'm...at your place. Oh, working on the case. Well, uh, we're taking a break, actually. With Sandy? Yeah. We're doing, uh, doing guy stuff. Oh. A-Alright. Well, uh, when you finish, uh, doing guy stuff, would you have Sandy give me a call? I-I just called to see if everything was okay. Is it? Uh, well... I guess. Uh, I don't know. You know, I-I've been really worried about you. Mmm. Thanks. I appreciate it. Well, I'll talk to you when I get back. Take care, Jimmy. Your concern for my husband is really touching. (women giggling) (loud rock music playing) She really is a dancer. (people whooping) DONNY: Yo, Chino! Come here! I want you to meet some of my boys. We have 45 minutes. Let's see if she wants to come to the house. Don't say "pool house." Right. Oh, dude! I thought you said you played before. Well, some people have a natural talent. Not me. I haven't played video games in... I-I can't remember the last time I played. Are we old? Because... if I didn't know better, I'd swear I was still 16. Oh, I'm still 22. It was the best year of my life. Yeah, why, uh, why 22? It's when I met Kirsten. And why 16? Oh, it's when, uh... I met Kirsten. (sighing) (phone ringing) Hello. RYAN: Marissa? Hey. Where are you? Yo. What did I tell you, man? How much better is this than Newport? I got dragged to a party, but, um, I'm leaving, I'm on my way. I just got to get Seth away from, uh, this dancer. "Dancer." It's a long story, but, uh, I'll be there soon. Save me some mac and cheese? Sure. See you. Seth, we're going. Whoa, ho, whoa. Uh, one second. Hang on a second, Ryan. Listen, I am really connecting with this girl. She just moved here with her sister from Uzbekistan, and they're saving for a condo, right? Nice. That hits here. Now, she does have a serious boyfriend, but you know what? She... Good luck with the condo. Some dude just demo'd a Range Rover. That car is messed up. So, this happened in the parking lot of the IMAX movie theater? (scoffs) Shark movies bring out a rough crowd. I'll call the insurance company, but you're explaining this to your mother tonight. Could get ugly. Yeah. (chuckles) So, did you call Marissa? Tried her again this morning. She doesn't want to talk. Hey, I'm sorry I salted your game, man. I got to get to work. So, I'll give you Richard's number when we get back. He's the best. He did Carol's divorce-- she got everything. Thanks. That'd be great. Are you really considering a divorce? Are you gonna call Jimmy and tell him? Julie needs to protect herself. I can't believe you're encouraging this, Karen. When your husband got caught with his assistant no one gave you the number to an attorney. Kirsten... that was very uncalled-for. No, what's uncalled-for is your $500-a-day coke habit in college. It was just sophomore year. What Jimmy did was wrong. Spare me. You have an entire Guatemalan family cleaning your house for less than minimum wage. I have spent this entire weekend listening to you women judge Jimmy. Yes, he made a mistake-- a big one-- but life is complicated and none of us is perfect not even you, Julie. What's that supposed to mean? He didn't buy ponies and jewelry for himself. How interesting that you should take his side. Shower time. Limo leaves at 6:00. He did all this because he wanted to give you everything and now you're gonna leave him? He lied to me, Kirsten. You lied to yourself! I know Jimmy. I know. I've heard. He still has your prom photo up on our wall. It's all in the past. Really? You think it's a coincidence that we ended up living next door to you? I'm the one who married him. This is my problem, not yours. Who knew that when he knocked me up it'd be the best thing that ever happened to you? Hey. Hey. Uh... your dad let me in. Seems like he's doing better. Yeah, I guess. (phone ringing) Do you need to get that? Oh, well, it's probably just Summer calling about another party at Holly's. Ah, yes, another one of those. So, how did it go with the dancer? Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Last night was totally my fault. Okay? Ryan was extremely bummed he didn't get to make his Blockbuster night and I know you're going through lot right now. The last thing you needed was to get stood up, so I apologize. Wow. That's very... thoughtful. Yeah, well, he's pretty mad at me right now so why don't you help a brother out? How about another date? Hmm? He's a good cook. I'll tell ya, one good swing... and I love this game. Nice drive. So, I talked to my friend, the securities attorney Working on the weekend? Working for you, to keep you out of jail. He's pretty sure he's gonna be able to make that happen. Excellent. It's contingent upon you making full restitution. You're gonna lose your Series 7 license and you'll never be allowed near another investment account but little or no jail time. So I got to pay back everything I lost? And, even then, there are no guarantees. But it's your only option. Yeah, well, that's... that's not an option. Where am I gonna find $4 million? Your house is valued at 3.2, you got 2.6 in equity. That's a good start. You want me to sell my house? (scoffs) Julie will... She'll leave me. Julie cares about you and the kids. She's not gonna care about giving up the house if it means keeping you. Whose wife are we talking about? No, we got to...come up with something else. This is it. This is a gift. Be grateful. Grateful? Did you think it was gonna go away? There were going to be no consequences? Who are you to tell me to get real? You live in a fantasyland. You married the richest girl in the county. You live in a house you never paid for. You get fired...Kirsten wouldn't even notice it. You've no idea what it's like to provide for a family. I think there's more to providing for a family... than money. You want to be there when Marissa graduates? You want to watch Caitlin grow up? You can start over. You can start a new life. I don't want a new life. I want-I want my old one back. But I guess that's not going to happen, huh? SETH: Hey. What's up? Seth Cohen, your friendly neighborhood pimp at your service. Had a little conversation with Marissa, it's totally handled. I'll be right back with your drinks. What are you talking about? Turns out I'm quite skilled at getting a date, provided it's not for me. You'll have the house to yourself. She's coming over shortly, and you will be cooking. What's up, man? Hey. What's the, uh, agenda for tonight? Any plans? Not really, no. Don't know of anything going on? There's a lame beach party-- typical Newport scene. You know what, man? We should go. No. Honestly, it's not for me. It's gonna be some water-polo guys and their girlfriends. I don't get the whole water-polo thing here. Nor do I. Just some dudes who enjoy wearing Speedos. What do these kids know about partying? I couldn't agree more. But the girls are hot. So, with the right attitude and a couple cocktails, could be fun. If it's not, we'll make it fun. Life is what you make it. That's very wise, Donny. Tell you what, man this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna go over there call a couple of my boys, drink their beer dance with their honeys, and have ourselves a good time. Alright. Alright? Alright. Enough with the whole moody scowl thing. Please, it's not a big deal. Taking him to the Newport party? Yeah, exactly. Now it'll be on my turf. I don't really have any turf, but if I had this would be it. And Summer'll be there. I don't know about this. I do. It's fine. It is not a big deal, I promise. Now, you got a date, okay, so you have to go. Make me proud. Put the sock on the door. Hey. I brought you some leftovers. That should go well with grilled cheese. My specialty. Ooh. Very fancy. Hey, don't knock it till you tried it. Dinner is served. (loud rock music playing) Kind of lame, right? I'm seeing...lots of potential in here, actually. Hey. Where's Marissa? She's at home. We're, uh... sort of taking a break. You are? Are you okay? Mmm! That was the best grilled cheese ever. Yeah? Well, your mac and cheese was pretty good, too. Yeah, well, it tasted better last night. Oh... (laughs) Yah! (laughs) Hey. But, hey, we're here now, right? Yeah. I'm glad... we are. So, how are you with everything? I'm okay, I guess. I mean, I still don't know what's gonna happen. My parents are fighting all the time. My family's not perfect... not even close, but... I just don't want us to fall apart. Let's do something fun. You can still have fun, right? I don't know. (whispers) What if you don't have a choice? What does that mean? (laughing) No. No, no, no, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Stop. Okay. (laughing) Oh, I'm taking you with me. (both scream) What's up, girl? You don't like to dance? Not with you. Uh, I'm trying to get to the bar. You're fine, you know that? Good one. But...aren't you, like, the busboy? (laughter) Ew! Random. Who is that guy? What's up? Somebody got a problem? Hey, hey. What's, uh, going on? Yo, these kids are mad-dogging me. Then why don't we go? I'm ready. Nah, I'm ready. Yeah, what? That's what I'm saying. Life is what you make it. Hurry up. I'm freezing. You've got goose bumps. I know. Towel. No sweatshirt? Can I borrow your tank tops so I look as cool as you? You wanna go back in the pool? (giggling) No. (phone ringing) Do you have to? Um... One second. Hello. Hey. It's Seth. Your friend Donny's kind of a psycho. Um, okay. Not really a good time right now. Dude, trust me, I wouldn't be calling if it wasn't serious. Just take my dad's car and meet me at Holly's. I'll be right there. Okay, so that was Seth. Uh, I got to go pick him up. He's at Holly's if you... I can't go there. Right. Okay, so... Sorry. I... Oh, it's okay. (heavy breathing and moaning) You know how long I wanted to do this? As long as I have? Oh, you guys should have broken up a long time ago. Oh. Chill, chill. Seriously, relax. What's up, bro? Hey. You want a drink? No, no. I'm cool. You sure? Yes. You want... ? It's vodka, very good. I'll do... What's up? (glass breaking) That sounded expensive. Come on. You go. I'll, uh... I'm right behind you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's my blender. Yo. Check it out. It's Abercrombie. Or are you, uh, Fitch? Jackass, what's your problem? You. Hey, Luke, I'm telling you.. Shut up, Cohen. How did you get in here, anyway? Look, I-I don't know who you are. You best be leaving. Or what? Hmm? What you going to do, man? What? You afraid I'm gonna mess your hair? Hey, Donny. What's up, man? Hey, what's up, Ryan? Should have figured he was your friend. Take him back to the trailer park? We should go. What'd you say to me? Alright. Let's go. You're done, man. What's up? What's up now? Who's the tough guy now, huh? How much you hate this kid, Ryan? The way he talks to you like you're trash. What about you, Seth? Yeah. He's definitely flawed. I'm sorry. I'm-I'm sorry, man. Look at the role reversal now, huh? Who's the bitch, huh? You scared him. Put it down, alright? I'm trying to have a good time. Trying to have fun. Yo, you boys having fun? (gunshot) I was just messing around. (screams) DONNY: Yo, we got to go. Let's go. Come on. Call an ambulance, somebody. (groans) You're going to be okay. TINA: I guess this is me. Thanks for a relaxing weekend, ladies. I'm off to fire my cleaning lady. Okay. See you at spinning. Bye, Tina. (sighs) (clears throat) Is it warm in here? Could you turn the air on, please? I'm sorry if I upset you. It wasn't my place. I remember, as a kid, if a saw a limousine driving, I always tried to see through the tinted window, wondering what kind of life the people inside lived. How glamorous and lucky. Who knew, right? You knew. You were probably in there staring back at me, which means I've been jealous of you since I was eight. When I met Jimmy, I had nothing. No money. I don't want to go back to being nothing again. You won't. You have a family, you have Jimmy. He loves you. Not as much as he loved you. But I knew that when I married him. I was winning the lottery. Great guy, great life. And he was doing the honorable thing. It's your turn, Julie. Don't abandon him. Hi. It's me. Yeah. No. Um... I'm sorry. I... I'm-I'm at the hospital. No. Everything's-everything's fine, uh, but, um... I think you're going to want to get down here. Hey. Hey. Hi. How did it go? Oh, not well. How about you? Mmm. Same. Sandy, what happened to our car? Seth will explain everything. Where is he? I don't know. He's out, I guess. You bought beer? Mm-hmm. I miss beer. (laughs) Mmm. Want a sip? I want more than that. Really? Mm-hmm. The boys might be out for a while. Hmm. (laughs) JIMMY: Hey. I didn't hear you come in. Pretty. So, how was your weekend? You win the lottery? (laughs) Funny. Uh... do you want sit or-or stand because I-I've got some news. It's not...gonna be easy. We've, uh... Well... you've got a decision to make. What is it, Jimmy? We can liquidate our assets, sell the house uh, and start all over with nothing as a family. Or we can declare bankruptcy, keep the house and I see you and the girls in about eight to ten years. It's up to you. Whatever you want to do... I'll do. SETH: The cops said Donny wasn't going to get far before they caught him. Well, if you wanna make some extra money I'm sure there's a job available at the restaurant. No, that's okay. I think it'd be good to take some me time work on the novel. Tonight would make a good chapter. Were you scared? Yeah. Hi. Hey. He's okay. He's with his parents, third floor. It's-It's just his arm. So, this guy, was he a friend of yours? Uh, no, no, not really. Um, well, thanks... for calling me. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I should go. I can, uh... wait. No, it's okay. I might be a while. Never thought the day would end here. I'm sorry, man. You were right. I never should have brought Donny to that party. No, it was my fault. If it wasn't for me, you never would have met him Luke wouldn't be in a hospital. I feel ever since I got here everyone's life's gotten worse. Not everyone. All I was thinking about in that ambulance was... I'm so gone. Back to Chino, or worse. Well, you're not going anywhere, so don't worry about it. I do think, from now on, though, we got to stick together because united we're unstoppable, but divided, it's like... People get shot. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. by paulonline
