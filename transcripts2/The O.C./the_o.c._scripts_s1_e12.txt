 Previously on The O.C. You know what I like about rich kids? Nothing. Let me meet you upstairs. Summer?! Anna? Ah, the gruesome twosome.

 * A long time ago * We used to be friends * Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah * Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah * Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah * Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah. ( groans softly ) Uh... do I have a fever? I think I might have a fever and/or the chills. Since when? Since recently. So, you're not feeling well? ( sighs ) No, I feel fine.

 ( coughing ): Just my head's a little bit achy, and my stomach's kind of weird. I'm okay. Come here. SANDY: Huh. You don't feel warm. What about cold or clammy? Maybe you've got the Summer flu. Yeah, it's November, but it's possible. Maybe you need some Anna-biotics. Do you not want to go to school? No, Dad, no. I want to go to school, okay? Okay. I'm just worried about infecting others. You're right, we can't take a chance. We should take you straight to the emergency room. ( sighs ) Just to be sure. Okay. Or I could stay home and-and-and try and sleep it off. Or you could go to school, face Summer and Anna and apologize. First of all, uh, no. Second of all, hmm, no. Why would I? Oh. The Summer flu-- I just got it. That was good. It's not my fault, they both tried to kiss me on Thanksgiving. What was I supposed to do, not kiss back? Say, "No, stop," risk hurting their feelings? Well, it seems to me you already did hurt their feelings. Yeah, perhaps I did, but what about my feelings, okay? Hello? I was the one who was assaulted. I am the victim here. How come you're not dressed? You're late. And so are you, or is that what ladies are wearing these days to Yogalates? Taryn called to remind you that today is the first day of your Yogalates workshop. Okay. Mom, Yogalates? ( groans ): Oh, I don't know if I'm going to go. I'm not feeling well. See? It's contagious. You know, you might still be a little hung over. From what? Uh, gee, I don't know, getting drunk and passing out on Thanksgiving? Hey, I had two glasses of wine. Whoa. Three. KIRSTEN: And I'm sure Julie Cooper has spread word around town that Kirsten Cohen now has a drinking problem. Which is why you have to go to Yogalates. 'Cause those chatty little newpsies will assume you're at home sleeping off another bender. And Summer and Anna will assume you're too afraid to face them. Hey, I'm not afraid of Summer and Anna, alright? Well, I'm not afraid of Anna. So you're going to school. And you're going to Yogalates. You just like saying that. Yogalates? I kind of do. Yogalates. You know what I want to know, Yogalates. Is why these two are so smug? Because for once, they didn't do anything wrong. That's true. Here's to ya. Back at ya. KIRSTEN: Enjoy it, boys, because, knowing the two of you, it won't last long. Yogalates. S01E12 The Secret * California, here we come * Right back where we started from * * California * California... * Here we come... * Oh. TEACHER: Your class presentations will account for one-third of your final grade, along with your term papers and, of course, the final exam. I'll be dividing the class into two-person teams. Each team will be responsible for presenting a detailed account of a pivotal event or period in European history. Now, I've already had quite a few partnership requests. However, in all fairness to the other students, I will select the teams myself at random, okay? Lauren and Kenny, the French Revolution. Ryan and Luke, the Spanish Inquisition. Stephanie and Bobby, the Protestant Reformation. Stephanie, are you listening? Stephanie? Miss Savage, please? You and Luke? I know. Holy unholy alliances. This is why I asked Mr. Bendis a week ago if we could be partners-- to avoid a situation like this. Why? Who did you get? Marcy Ross and I are doing Cortes and the Aztecs. I like Marcy Ross. She's got a good smile. It's innocent but it's knowing. You going after Marcy now, too? Hey, hey, I'm the victim here, okay? Don't tell me, tell Summer. And Anna, and, hey, eventually, you might want to tell, uh, Marcy, too. Mm-hmm. What are you and Luke doing? That was me ignoring you, by the way. Spanish Inquisition-- I'm supposed to meet him after school. You're going into the belly of the beast, into the heart of darkness? It's not gonna be bad. You guys might even end up being friends. Hmm! You think? No, it's too weird. My ex-boyfriend hanging out with my boyfriend? What are you guys gonna talk about? I can only think of one thing. SANDY: So, I talked to my guy at the SEC and to your clients, and they all agree that if you make full restitution by January 1... So that means selling the house. Well, it also means avoiding criminal prosecution, and jail time. I can't sell the house now. It's almost the holidays. I can't do that to Julie and Kaitlin. They don't have to move out now, Have the Realtor show the house when Julie's out and Kaitlin's at school What if she says no? She's got her name on it too. What choice does she have? She can't afford to live there if you're in jail. Not if she's got Caleb Nichol in her pocket. SUMMER: You had lunch with him? No. I had lunch with Ryan. Seth was just, you know, there. SUMMER: I cannot believe you. Coop, where is your loyalty? What did he say? Nothing. I'm not getting involved. Oh, that means he said something. What did he say? Nothing. I told you. Hello? What did he say? What'd who say? Seth. Oh... it's you. ( sighs ) You're, like, flossing... at school. Do you have any idea how much bacteria accumulates in your mouth between lunch and dinner? No, but the fact that you do tells me everything. Look, if you want him, you can have him. I'm done. Thanks. But that's okay. Right, because you couldn't possibly be interested in someone that's interested in me? No. Because I couldn't possibly be interested in someone who treats women that way. Oh. So, how much bacteria? Like, a lot? A lot. Thanks. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hey. I was hoping I would bump into you-- I wanted to... H-Hi, Summer... and Anna hanging out together. Wow. Wow, that's, uh... that's awkward. Not really. Well, I meant for me. Um... How are you guys? You guys good? You guys getting along? Yes. In fact, we were just about to go to the library, to do some... research. We were? Yeah. Uh-huh. The library. Mm-hmm. For books. Books. Yeah, and then we thought we'd go shopping, right? Uh, South Coast Plaza? Sounds good! Alright. Okay. Okay. That doesn't sound good... at all. Hey, guys. Kirsten! You made it. How you feeling, sweetie? Julie told us you were "under the weather" on Thanksgiving. She did? Yeah, well, the holidays can be so stressful. I could go for a little hair of the dog myself right about now. We'll see you out there. Hey, wait up, guys. Julie? Oh, Kirsten, you showed up. How are you feeling? So, did you tell everyone I was drunk at Thanksgiving? Well, everyone was wondering where you were, so... I was at the office, working. Hey, it's okay, I mean, we're all friends here. Well, if we're all friends, why don't you start acting like one? Hi... Ryan, isn't it? Hi. Luke just got home-- he'll be right down. Come in. ( boys arguing ) Guys, guys, this is Luke's friend Ryan. Ryan, this is Eric and Brad. Give it now! Who wants a snack? Me! Me! Me! Ryan? Hello. Daddy, you're home! Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! There they are! How you doing? Can we play some ball later, please? You know what, kids, I'm just home to drop off Mom's car. Uh, one of the belts was misaligned. I had them change the oil, too. Sorry, fellas. You remember Luke's friend Ryan? They're doing a school project together. Oh, yeah? What about? Uh, Spanish Inquisition. Oof. Not one of Western civilization's proudest moments. I was a history major at USC, now I sell cars for a living. Oh, don't listen to him, Ryan. He owns three auto dealerships. God, Mom, brag much? She's just being proud of me. Let's do this. We got work to do. Yeah, me, too. Gus is outside. I'll see you tonight. Ryan, keep him on his toes, please. Luke, SC-Notre Dame this Saturday. I thought we'd drive up about noon, tailgate? Yeah, cool. Ryan, I don't know if you're a Trojan man, but it's gonna be a good game. You're more than welcome. ( boys arguing ) Guys! ( Luke sighs ) So, how do you want to do this? Uh, I don't know. I was thinking... I got books from the library. I pulled some stuff off the Web. I was thinking we could do, a screen show on my PowerBook. My Dad's got a film scanner at the office, color laser jet, PowerPoint. We could just pull some stuff here and then head over there. You know, or not. Nah, nah, that-that sounds good. Yeah. ( phone line ringing ) ( sighs ) JULIE: Hello? Hey, it's me. Can you talk? Yeah. I'm just packing up some of Marissa's winter things. I was going to drop them by in the morning, if that's okay. Yeah, yeah, that's-that's... that's great. What's going on, Jimmy? Look, I, uh, I had a meeting with Sandy. And it looks like I have to pay everything back by January 1. Jimmy, it's the holidays. I don't have any other choice. What are we supposed to do? Where are we going to live? Your Mother or... Caleb's? No, no, we can't, and we shouldn't have to. This is my house, too, and Kaitlin's, and we're not selling. Julie... I could go to jail. ( sighs ) Maybe you should, Jimmy. Have you ever thought about that? Maybe you deserve to go to jail. ( dial tone ) Dad? Hello? Dad, you here? I don't know, must've gone home. Nice, huh? They're giving these away. Oh, nice. It's in. Check it out-- 450 horsepower, eight cylinder. ( Luke sighs ) Dude, you have to get in. ( sighs ) Wow, man. Stereo's insane. * Call you on the telephone * She's not there * You always leave me alone... Hey, is that your dad? LUKE: Oh, yeah, that's his business partner Gus. We should go say hey. ( alarm beeping ) If you tell anyone... I won't. Let's go! Let's go! Luke? ( alarm continues beeping ) No... Luke! Sorry I'm late. I slept through my alarm. Oh, yeah, it's okay. How'd it go last night? You didn't call me, so? We were working pretty late. Did you meet his mom? She's really great. She seemed nice, yeah. I'm sure his dad was out of town? Uh... no... he was there. Really? 'cause, he's never around. He's got these dealerships in other cities and he's always traveling. Oh. What? Nothing. Just, uh... need some coffee. Okay, I knew you guys were going to talk, so what did he say about me? Nothing. Fine, I'll go grab Seth. Wait. Something happened last night. But I told Luke I wouldn't say anything. Is it... is he okay? What is it? Ryan, you can tell me. You can't tell anyone, not even Summer, especially Summer. I won't, I swear. Because I'm not even telling Seth. You can trust me. I won't say a word. I promise. Well, apparently some of us are on Central Time. Yeah, sorry. So, how was your date with Luke, your new study buddy? It was fine. Something for the road? Yes, I'd like something for the road-- it's called gossip. Was there any cross burning, any goose stepping? Small Taiwanese family locked in the basement? What? Not so much. Fruit, bagel? Yeah, bagel would be good. Yes, so would some information. Dude, you went behind enemy lines, come on, the parents? What's the deal, cyborgs, supremacists, vegans? We just ended up at his dad's dealership looking at cars. You guys friends now? First, Summer and Anna, now you and Luke. They came out of the bathroom together, then they went off to the library... together. Together! Stranger things have happened. These are two people who hate each other, brought together by their even greater hatred of me. It's like Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader teaming up to destroy the Emperor. Hey, we should talk about... We got nothing to talk about. Our presentation. I'll finish it myself. Alright. What are you looking at, queer? Somebody writing you new material? Alright, go with what works. I got to get to Spanish. So, this means you and Luke are not friends, which I find oddly comforting. I promise. * Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah * Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah * Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah * Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah * Is it something I said... So, hey... big test. * ...Baby, I wasn't home... You know what? Don't. * And everybody knows * The rest of it's fine * And everybody knows * Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah * Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah... Hey. Want to... over there? Hey. Hey. Is this seat taken? It is now. So, did you study for this bio thing? Kind of. I didn't. Don't worry, all you have to remember is, kittens prefer cream or fish, generally speaking. Excuse me? Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. Wow, you're like really smart huh? Compared to what? Well, me. Summer, you're smart. Well, smart enough to sit next to you. What was that kitten thing again? Kittens prefer cream or fish generally speaking. Or, if you're not a cat person-- King Philip comes over for good sex. Definitely not a cat person. That's really good. Thank you. ( both laughing ) ( laughter echoing ) * A long time ago * We used to be friends... I am so sore. Are you? I'm fine. You must not have stretched properly. Are you okay? Sandy told me about the house. Nothing to tell. I'm not selling. Julie. Julie, if you and Kaitlin need somewhere to live, I can find you a house. My dad can find you a house. Not according to him-- not without compromising our relationship. He said that? I told him if that's true, we don't have to have a relationship. So, now we don't. I had no idea. I'm so sorry. Wow, you'd think you'd be celebrating. Go ahead, tell everybody that Caleb Nichol dumped me, my husband is going to jail, and I have no place to live. What are you waiting for? I told everybody about Thanksgiving. Now is your chance to get even. If you need anything, let me know. ( woman giggling ) My God! You guys, I just ran into Betsy on the elliptical trainer. She was getting her car serviced this morning... Okay, come here, come here. Okay, you can't tell anyone, but you are not going to believe this. ( clearing throat ) Okay. I've got to tell you, Jimmy, I've never seen you hit the ball like that. You crushed it. Creative visualization. Julie's head. Get a Realtor. Show the house. But she... Julie will change her tune. Once word spreads that the SEC is investigating her as a possible co-conspirator, forget about it. They are? I can make a call. Thank you. I'll get this one. Thanks. You know, I've got to say, you've just been incredibly cool with me. You know, considering everything. I really appreciate you not saying anything, and I know you only heard it from Kirsten's point of view, but I, you know, I want you to hear it from me. That whole thing is just a huge mistake. I'm really sorry. Jimmy, what the hell are you talking about? Kirsten didn't... didn't tell you? Tell me what? Um... Um... you know, when Julie kicked me out, I was lost. And Kirsten came over to help me set up my place, and, um... I... kissed her. She was totally mortified. You know, and I apologized immediately. She left. Like faster than that. And she didn't tell you because she didn't, she didn't want to... she didn't want to hurt you. It meant nothing, so she didn't want to hurt you over... over nothing. Which, now, I've done. Creative visualization, Jimmy. I'm trying hard not to see your head as something I should hit. Look, I'm really sorry. You know, I just didn't want there to be any secrets between us. ( phone ringing ) Mission accomplished. Hey. I have some news, but I'm only telling you. Oh my God. Coop! You're not going to believe this. Did you hear about Luke's dad? I haven't heard about Luke's dad. Hey, I have crazy news for you. About your women problems... No, it's definitely not. I heard his dad's favorite show is Dawson's Crack. I heard it was Ever Woody. Wait, Ryan... Hey, man, look... Who'd you tell? Listen, I'm sorry. You're dead. Everyone knows. Yeah, well, who'd you tell? What? I didn't tell anyone. Was it Summer? I asked you not to. Why assume it was me? I'm the only one who knew and you're the only one I told. I didn't tell anyone. I never should have told you in the first place. Probably not, since obviously you don't trust me. You know what? Find your own ride home. Hi. Hi. It's amazing about the Wards. How fast word travels. Sometimes. Well, I'd ask you if everything's okay. It's not. Which leads me to my next question. Oh, it's well-covered territory with us. Jimmy Cooper. I, uh...oh, I want to do my best not to sound too, uh, high school, but... he kissed you? He told you? He didn't want there to be any secrets between us. Apparently, you don't feel the same way. Of course I do. It's just that it meant nothing. Putting my own skepticism about that remark aside for just a moment, if it meant nothing, then why didn't you tell me? Because, I knew it would upset you. Thank you. Because I feel so much better having heard it from someone else. I'm sorry. All this time, all this suspicion and paranoia about me and my coworker, and you're sitting on this. Sandy. Sandy... it means nothing. It means something to me. Okay, it's just that after all the years of Luke calling me gay, I don't know I think it's great that the shoe is on the other, actually, it's on his dad's foot But you get the symmetry. It's not funny. It's the end of their marriage. Their life as they knew it is over. I heard Meredith is already filing for divorce. I was just over there. They seemed really happy. Yeah? By happy, do you mean gay? Seth. Cut it out. How could you be married to someone for that long and keep that kind of a secret? Oh, you'd be surprised. But eventually the secrets come out. And some marriages can handle the truth and some can't. Yeah, well, I'm sure everyone will be so accepting, seeing as we're such a liberal, tolerant bunch. That was at the expense of Orange County, not Luke's dad. His big, gay dad. What straight guy has arms like that? Not my husband. When Charles and I went to see The Lion King with the Wards, and Carson cried. Wept. ( laughing ) All these years I've known him, he's never made a pass at me. I feel so much better. ( laughter ) I can't be here right now. What do you have in mind? Fried food and beer. First round's on me. Alright, if everyone will take his or her seat, we shall begin. Anyone seen Luke? Okay, let's open our books to page 59, The Chesapeake and West Indian Colonies. So, we should come over, like, at 4:00? I've got Lit Mag after school, but I can come by after that. Okay, The flash cards should be done by then, so... Perfect. Hi, Can I speak to you for one minute, please? Because I owe you both an enormous apology. Actually, I guess, technically, I owe two apologies. Each one, tailored to the specific wrongs visited upon the specific person, since you two seem to be a package deal these days... Cohen? Right. Uh, I'm sorry. Okay, and I'm sorry. And I'm also sorry that I apologized to her first. It's just, you know, chronologically... Cohen. Stupid, I know. Let me start by saying nothing in my life, nothing prepared me for the events of that fateful Thanksgiving day. But I'm not going to make any excuses for what I did. I just want to say one little thing in my defense, which is you can't really blame me for wanting the company of either of you two. And, I know that I hurt your feelings and I feel bad about that. I do. But please believe me when I say that it wasn't intentional, okay? I would never do anything to ruin our friendship. Or 'ships. So, look, I know I have no right to ask. I just hope that someday you can both forgive me. Okay, so, yeah, thanks for your time. You know what? I never really liked flash cards. They've never really worked for me. You know, I think I study better alone. That's good because Lit Mag's going to go a little bit late tonight. Maybe next test. Maybe. Uh-huh. It's like they enjoy it. Well, I can't exactly claim that I didn't once see the fun in witnessing the fall of the rich and fabulous. Then I became homeless, and suddenly not so funny. I don't really think that my dad would let you go homeless. Yeah, well, when I even mentioned that I have to sell the house, he went into a panic. You'd have thought I was asking for a ring. That's so him. When I tried to explain... He didn't listen. Not a word. Can I ask you a question? Do you like that he calls you Kiki? Hate it. 'Cause he kept calling me Ju-Ju. Like that candy that gets stuck in your teeth. When he gets something in his head... It has to be his way. Always. It's just who he is. He just can't spend longer than three months with the same woman before he freaks. Oh, he freaked alright. I wish that I could tell him that I know what he's doing. He's trying to replace my mom. But he can't. And I just wish that he would stop trying and be happy. But you can't talk to my dad. No, I know. And the important thing is that he finds someone to share his life with, enjoy these years... I just don't know if he's ever going to figure that out. Hi. Hey. So, that apology-- aside from being the first I've ever received from a boy, was also the nicest. Oh. Well, I meant it, so, so, good. So, what are you doing Saturday? Hey, Seth. Hey. You going to Lit Mag? Uh, yeah. Want to walk together? Uh, do you? Yes. That was so sweet what you said earlier. And I could tell you really meant it. We both know sincerity's not your strong point. I'm working on it. I'd like to help. What are you doing Saturday night? Well, in the new spirit of sincerity, um... I have a date with Summer. Oh. Yeah, so... What are you doing Friday night? What am I doing Friday night? ( doorbell rings ) Hi. Why are you here? Same reason you are. Hey. You okay, man? ( woman sobbing ) Look, man... I owe you an apology. It wasn't you who said anything. My dad, after we saw him, he... came out to my mom and she wigged and called a couple friends and then everybody in Newport knew, so... Don't worry about it. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Hey, Mom. ( sobbing ) Meredith, please. Luke, could I, um...? Luke, please? My entire life has been a giant lie. Everything I thought I knew about my dad. I mean, all those business trips he took? Or how about when he missed one of my games because he was "working late." I don't even know if this guy was the first one, or if there were others. I can't even think about it. Look, I know it's hard. But after everything I've been through with my dad, we've never been closer. I mean, we're finally able to be honest with each other and talk to each other. And I don't know. Maybe you could have that. What he has to say I don't want to hear. I'm going to go grab a jacket. It's cold. Well, even if he wasn't honest with you, he still cared. He did make it to some of your games. Whatever. What does it even matter? It matters. Especially if you had a dad who didn't make it to any of your games, who didn't even know what sport you played or cared. Everything is just so screwed up. Isn't this romantic? A couple of harbor butt pirates. Is there a problem? Other than the fact that we kick your ass every year? No, dude. No problem at all. Didn't mean to interrupt your date. Fag. What'd you call me? Yo, dude, keep your hands off me. Save that for your boyfriend. Let's not do this. What about a black eye for the queer guy? Yo, why don't you just run to your daddy? Julie, hi. I just had to come over and say thank you. For what? I got home-- there was a message on my machine. "It's Caleb, call me." Whatever. Well... I know, but I call him, right? Just in case he's ready to apologize. Which, P.S., he's not. So, he starts in again with the excuses and the he's feeling pressured. Well, because it's all about him. Exactly, then I remembered what you said. So, I let him have it. You did? I told him he's scared, life's too short, spend it with someone you enjoy. You did? He doesn't think it came from you. He thinks I came up with it, the important thing is it worked. How so? Kirsten, he's buying my house as an investment. Jimmy's not going to jail. Kaitlin and I have a place to live, and who knows? Maybe someday your next-door neighbor will be your dad. I don't know what to say. Well, you might want to water that. Bye. BUGS: Hey, you look like a strong, healthy boy. Give me a hand. ( creature growling ) Hey, Seth. Ask your mother who was at the door. Uh, Mom, who was at the door? Julie Cooper, bearing gifts. Julie Cooper, Dad. Ask your mother what she wanted. ( clearing throat ) Um... Dad wants to know who, what, what she want... Better idea. Ask her yourself. Come on. Julie Cooper sold her house. Ah! To my father. Oh. Now, that I wish you hadn't told me. Hey. Oh, my God. Are you guys okay? I didn't do it this time. I'm going to get the first-aid kit. Come on, have a seat. Hey, what happened? I guess bad news travels fast. Have you called your folks? I'll call them. No. I'd rather not call them, if-if it's okay. Alright. He can stay in the guest room. Sure. I'm gonna call his dad. Okay. So, do you guys need a ride to school in the morning? You don't mind? Yeah, well, you were pretty great with Luke today. I never should have told you. Because I'll tell everyone, right? No, because he asked me not to. But, see, the unwritten rule of relationships says you're allowed to tell your girlfriend, because everything you say to me, stays with me, and vice versa. So then you didn't tell anybody that I went off on you yesterday when I thought you told. No. Well... I mean, just Summer. Will you tell Summer about this? No. This will stay just between us. Carson, are you sure that I can't get you anything to eat... Scotch? Xanax? No, thank you. He's not coming down. Well, he's half asleep. It would be better if you guys talked in the morning. He's not going to want to talk to me. I lied to him. I lied to everyone. I, uh... The truth is, I love his mom. I always have, and I love our family and I just didn't, uh, want to hurt anybody, and now, he's up there hurting. Hey... if there's anything we could do... No, no, I've embarrassed my family enough. I think the best thing I could do right now is to just disappear. Oh, I think that'd be the worst thing you could do. It's what you've been doing all along, you know? But coming out, and being honest with yourself and your family, in this town, it's the bravest thing you could have done. Look, it's just my opinion, but... you're the kind of father any kid would be proud of. Well, I should go. Dad. Just let me grab my shoes. I'll go with you. So... while we're being honest? Oh, God. There's more? That was a pretty impressive speech you made in there. Well, you know, I'm prone to impressive speeches. Right up until that line, yeah. So, from now on, are you going to tell me all your secrets? Are you going to tell me all yours? I don't think I have any. Really? You sure? I think. Nothing from your past? No secret fantasies? No hidden porn stash on the PC? No, 'cause obviously you already know about that one. There is no way you can know everything about someone. That's what keeps it interesting. Well, it hasn't been uninteresting. At a certain point, you have to trust the other person. That's what love is. Okay, so you'll have to trust that you can tell me things that you know, I, I may not want to hear, and we, we can handle it. Like... Jimmy Cooper kissed me? Trust me. ( teakettle whistling ) This is gonna be weird. Yup. Everybody's gonna be staring at me, talking. Yup. * Too young to pretend... Maybe I can just blow the whole thing off, go hit the beach, give everybody time to get it out of their systems. It doesn't work like that.
