 Previously on The O.C. My dad is in real estate development. You guys bought the, uh...the mall? Mm-hmm. And I'm in charge of residential development. You're here with him? We're not here together. We're done. Go after her. Tell her how you feel. Want to do something tonight? I'm taking you with me. You can start over. You can start a new life.

 I see you and the girls in eight to ten years. Who's the bitch? (screaming) Call an ambulance, somebody! You're going to be okay. Are we worried your dad won't love us if we don't feed him enough? Alright, starting now no more digs at my dad. Honey, that wasn't a dig. Seth! No. When he called him a heartless bastard, that was a dig. You sold me out. See, they're like puppets, and I am the puppet master.

 World domination to follow. Maybe you guys can make peace this weekend? Okay. Oh, oh, no, wait, we can't! Why? I'm still Jewish. Just getting it out of my system, I promise. Wonder what his new girlfriend's like. I am sure she is very well-paid. I am on fire. Look at you. You're wired. Seeing your parents should make you feel guilt, not terror. Don't forget, I'm also her boss. Dad! Speak of the devil and the devil, he doth appear. Shalom, Sandy. How long have you been here? Not long. The Leer Jet reached quicker than I expected. I used my key to get in. So, Caleb. Where's your new girlfriend? She's taking a swim. Where's my grandson? So, your grandpa, he basically owns Newport, right? Yes and much like yourself, he comes from humble beginnings. You guys will hit it off. I burned down one of his homes. But it was an accident. He owns a million of 'em. It's probably not even on his radar. Hey, seriously, do not worry about it. Okay, look. My mom runs the company now. He's got a brand-new girlfriend. He's very mellow. Seth. Hey. Hey. How you doin'? You're still not a football player. Oh, yes. No, but thank you. Uh, Grandpa, meet my friend Ryan. This is the kid that burned down my house. Come on. You ought to see my pictures from Spain and promise me you'll go to Barcelona while you're still young. Alright. You want to take those and put 'em around by the grill? Hey. Hi. Hi. I'm Gabrielle. I'm with Caleb. Oh, my God, that could be my grandma. (piano and acoustic guitar) * California, here we come * Right back where we started from * * California * California... * Here we come * Oh S01E06 The Girlfriend Is it twisted to find my potential grandma really hot? Not when she looks like that. CALEB: Gabrielle? Yeah? We're going to sit, drink some wine, catch up. Okay. Do you want me to, uh...? Hang out in the sun. Get some color. Try to stay out of trouble. Can I join you guys? Yeah! Yeah. Come on in... Ooh! It's warm. So, what's up? We were, uh... You... You were talking about... You were telling... Yeah, that thing. So, this birthday party for Caleb, it's... like, a who's who of Newport? Should be wild, huh? I'm being sarcastic. Ah, Yes. We don't get a lot of that here. So, who are you guys bringing? I'd say no one, really. Yeah, same. You're kidding, right? There are no girls you want to bring? Two young, hot guys like yourselves? Are you still being sarcastic? No. Her name is Summer. And? Did you invite her yet? It's not that simple. I mean... She can't say yes if you don't ask her. That is very wise, Gabby. What about you? (sighs) Did you ask Marissa? I haven't talked to her. I don't think she'll go. And why not? Uh... Her family's kind of falling apart. Uh... She's got this boyfriend she may be back with. It's a long story. They've been going out since fifth grade. Fifth grade? She needs to change it up. She's known that guy since he was eating paste. I think he still does. (knocking) Hey, babe, you decent? Hey. What are you doing here? Oh, I just, uh, came from the doctor's. Got my stitches out. Thought we could celebrate by hitting the beach. Don't you think it's too soon? You should probably go home and rest. Oh, no, no. That's all I've been doing. Luke, you got shot. Yeah, I know. I know how lucky I am to have a second chance. That's why I don't want to waste any more time. Well, what do you mean? I've been an idiot. I never should've broken up with you in the first place. And now, with everything that's going on with your dad... The thing is, you were there for me when I was in the hospital. And now, I want to be here for you. It's all just been so crazy. I just wish we could be together like it was. I... I don't know. Oh, you don't have to. I mean, we can take it slow. Tell you what. Let's just hang out here today. We'll sit by the pool, or, uh... or watch a movie or something. Whatever you want. Okay. Gabrielle-- she seems... She's 24. I'm sorry? Oh, she seems so mature for her age. These birthday festivities-- we're keeping them small, right? It depends what you mean by small. Well, just the family four of us, Gabrielle. Right. The four of us... Gabrielle, Ryan, and 150 of your closest friends. Cal, she's been working overtime on this thing-- the menus, invitations... on top of the mountain of work she's been buried under. Is it too much? No. Work's great. We're on track with new developments. After your boy out there nearly burned it to the ground. We've had a few setbacks. But the accident insurance more than covered the damages. And then, I hear that you've commissioned an architect that I never approved to do the redesign. I commissioned a design but I would never build without consulting you. Honey, you don't need my approval. After all, you adopted the boy without consulting me. I would've, called you about Ryan, Dad, but there wasn't enough time. I get it. I'm pushing you too hard. Things are slipping through the cracks, which is why I've decided to scale back your responsibilities. You're demoting me? I want to get more involved. Give you a chance to spend time with your new family. Your new son. Now, then, tell me all about Jimmy Cooper. Son of a witch lost $4 million? I took Kaitlin by the stables to say goodbye to China. Guess she won't be needing these anymore. You know, I think China was her best friend. China's a horse. Maybe to you. Hey, you know... I don't feel good about this. Well, you shouldn't. What do you... What do you want from me? I think I want a divorce. I'm sorry, honey. I just don't see any other way. Hey. I was on my way to work, um... and we hadn't talked in a while. I was going to call you. No, it's cool. So, Kirsten's dad's in town. They're having this... LUKE: Hey... Hi. Hey, how you doin', man? Uh, fine. Yeah, um... I never got a chance to thank you for... taking me to the hospital, and, uh... giving Marissa a call. Yeah. No problem. Hey, do you have some aspirin or something? My arm's killing me from the stitches. Yeah, check in my parents' bathroom. Thanks. Hey, take it easy, guy. So, what's going on? I was going to see if you wanted to... I was going to see how you were doing. You seem to be doing good, so... I'm going to get to work. Later. Hey. Oh, hey. Seth and Caleb are sailing. I've never seen two people more excited about boats. Seth said you worked here, and I could use a cocktail. Uh... I can't serve you. Right. You're not legal. (chuckles) Uh...how about a cranberry juice? That I can do. Alright. From the flight. I hate flying. You? I've never been on a plane. My first time, I was 15. My mother sent me to Japan all by myself to do some modeling. I guess she figured it was easier than her getting a job. I can relate. I've heard. So, uh, how'd the modeling thing turn out? Well, when you're a teenager, and you're living in a house with a bunch of girls with no parents, things can get a little insane. By the time I got clean, I was 22--retirement age. You must think it's weird, me with an older guy. I live in a pool house. Mmm. (clears throat) So how'd it work out with your girl? (sighs) Paste-eater? They have a past. Excuse me. Some more water. Oh, Kirsten, come on, honey. You could not have done more or done better. I just don't understand. I've-I've worked so hard for him. I've killed myself for him. The man is a bottomless pit of need. You think you can fill it? You can't. Oh... You're amazing. If he can't appreciate you, screw him. Quit. (whispering) Quit. You've never supported me working for him. You've never liked him. You're right. I haven't. Not since our wedding day. When I watched you walk yourself down the aisle. He was in Singapore. There was a monsoon. Oh, baby, we changed the date three times for his schedule. He makes the world revolve around him, including you. Sandy, he's my dad. He's ruining your life. Quit. I can't. So you're living in a pool house. And then...so what's next for you? What's next for you? A Lear Jet to London? Paris in the fall? Perhaps. Be right back. Hey. Hey. Got a minute? What's up? I wanted to talk to you before, but... Luke was there. Right. Um... he wants to get back together. What did you tell him? I told him I needed to think about it. Uh-huh. I don't know what I should do. I don't know either. I know. I just... Look, if you came here for me to help you choose... Of course not. Good. Why don't you let me know when you've made up your mind, okay? Okay. * We got more bounce in California * * Than all y'all combined * We got more bounce in California * MARISSA: If he just said something. I mean, I just wanted him to say anything. You can't expect him to choose. He comes from a place where they have knife fights drag racing, sex on the hood of a car. That's from Fast and the Furious. Well, that movie was based on a true story. No, it wasn't. Whatever. All I'm saying is, you have to do the choosing. Not him or Luke. * First in new directions * 'Cause Cali leads the way * We got more bounce in California * * Than all y'all combined * We got more bounce in California * * We like to party all the time * * We got more bounce in California * It's fate, it-it's destiny. Look, we both like burritos. You want to eat somewhere else? Who's winning right now, me or my hair? I'm going to get us some salsa. Okay. Hi, Summer. Seth Cohen. Could you give me a hand? Over here. Okay... I... I know you got to figure some stuff out. I get that. But, in the meantime, there's this party at, uh... well, it's for Seth's grandfather. I know. I'm going. Luke asked me this morning. Cool. Well, um... I'll see you... and Luke tomorrow, then. Yeah. See you. Two salsa verdes-- aggressive. Pico de gallo-- that's a classic. Holy jalapeno! Somebody came to play. Eww! Are there any napkins? No. Lick it. What? I just got my nails done. It'll ruin the polish. You lick it. I don't like picante. It's for Marissa. Thanks. It's good. Now, aren't you going to invite me to your grandpa's party? I'm sorry, Summer. Could you please repeat that? Your grandpa's having this awesome party. It's at your house. And I thought we were friends. Wait a second. Do you want me to ask you 'cause you wanna go with me, or just 'cause you want to go? Fair enough. I'll see you at 8:00. Hey. Hey. How was court? I was distracted all day. I couldn't help but think, if you quit, you know what we'd do? I'm not quitting. No, hear me out. We could find out who's living at our old house, buy it back. You loved that house. Seth loved that house. That house had bad plumbing and termites. It was a fixer-upper that we never got to fix up. (chuckling): I know. We moved 'cause your mom got sick. We never planned to stay. If you quit, we could do anything we want. We could go anywhere. No, we can't. Why not? Seth's been planning his exodus from here since he was six. Ryan wouldn't care. You could get that little gallery in Sausalito you've always dreamed of, or the Mission. You could put your art history degree to good use. I haven't thought about that gallery in years. So... Think about it. Think about it. Is this too slutty to wear to an old guy's birthday party? I don't want the dude to have a coronary. I can't believe you're actually going with Seth. Aloha. Caleb Nichol is like the Donald Trump of the West. Do you know how many hot, rich, 20-something banker-brokers are going to be there? A lot. And now I have someone to introduce me to them. Isn't that a little mean to Seth? To who? Kidding. That was delicious, Kirsten. Oh, thank you. I order from them all the time. With less time at work, more time for cooking. Yeah, because there's just no place Kirsten feels more comfortable than in a kitchen. What're you talking about? Mom can't make cereal. Thanks, Seth. I love you, Mom. I love you, too. You have a quick wit, Seth. Amazing you're not better at skirt chasing. Oh, well, if by "skirts" you mean girls-- in your outdated cowboy speak-- I have a little news for you. Turns out, somebody has a date to your party. And it's not a big deal or anything, but if you must know, Summer asked me. Well, Summer. Wow. Summer's hot. You did not just say that. Say what? Just go, please. You go. What about you, Ryan? Nope. Going by myself. Caleb seems to be in good spirits. He polished off his second bottle of merlot. Now would be a good time to talk. I don't know if I'm ready to have that conversation. What conversation? Got any grappa? Yeah. Are you adopting another kid? It's nothing. Well, actually, it's something. Didn't know my daughter needed someone to speak for her. Maybe you've never gotten to know your daughter. If you did, you'd know she's the best thing that happened to your company. You wouldn't demote her to the point where she'd wanna quit. Sandy! You want to quit? No... Kirsten. We were talking. About selling this house and moving back to Berkley. You're not serious. You're still smoking the weed, aren't you? KIRSTEN: Dad... Dad, you smoke weed? Out, now. Private conversation. Ryan, guess who's a stoner. Honey, don't be afraid of him. You keep your mouth shut. No one here cares what you think. Don't talk to me like that in my own house. Whose house is this? Who built it? Who paid for it? Dad... This is between you and me, Kiki. CALEB: You're gonna do what you want. Should we, maybe, go? ...marry who you wanted to, adopting juvenile delinquents... Maybe, let's just... Yeah, let's. KIRSTEN: You're making a much bigger deal of this. It was nothing. It didn't sound like nothing. In fact... thanks, Sandy, for letting me know how she feels. She would never tell me that. She never tells me anything. If you want to quit, that's fine. I'll expect your resignation in the morning. Now then, the grappa. So, Gabrielle, I heard Grandpa's taking you on the helicopter tour tomorrow. Yup. He wants to show me his Orange County empire. This game sucks. SETH: Let me see it. (sighs) Ryan, you've been playing the pirate game? That's a little bit minty. What else do you have? I'll go get you Pro Skater 3. It's good. Hey, we gotta go searching for my dad's bong later, alright? Hmm? So... he always yell like that? Pretty much. He's the boss, and every relationship is a business relationship to him. Even yours? He'll only ever really love one woman. And she passed away years ago. Now he's just looking to stay entertained. Keep from being bored. But aren't we all? I am so bored. D-Do you think...? Don't think. CALEB (yelling): Gabrielle! We're leaving. Now. Back to the office. How's Gabrielle? I don't know. Oh, really? Okay, Ryan, let me present Exhibit "A" to you. She opted to forego sailing to go to the Crab Shack? So? Not everyone likes sailing. Okay, let's take it to Exhibit "B" here. Intense. Some might even say "Smoldering eye contact at the dining room table." She was mad-dogging you. And, finally, the clincher: last night, in the pool house, she chose to sit on your bed even though there was an empty chair. Come on, boys, out of the pool. Caterers are here. It's time to get ready. Okay. I would like some answers. Yeah, okay. We hooked up. What? Isn't that what you're asking with the whole Exhibit "A"? I noticed some heavy flirting, yes. You hooked up with my grandma? Actually, that's kind of hot. How was it? No one can know about this. Your grandpa cannot find out. Yeah, I agree completely. How was it? It was good. Weird, but... good. Wh... Well, what about Marissa? What about her? Uh... '73 Dom. Yes, that's his favorite. Thank you. Is there cilantro in that? Great. He hates it. I can't believe you still went through with this whole thing. Well, I had no choice. Even though you tried to sabotage the entire weekend. Oh, honey, I'm sorry I jumped the gun last night. Ready? Mm-hmm. Hello. Hi. Dad, you made it. How you doing? Disappointed? No. Nice to see you. Sandy. Hey, happy birthday, Caleb. Thank you. Can I get you a drink? Absolutely. Dad, happy birthday. Thanks. Look, about the other night... Ah, just forget about it. Make sure that you let me know when you plan to give notice so that I can hire your replacement. MAN: Caleb. Quite a party. You look, uh... wow. You clean up good. You trying to get caught? Find me later. I wish Dad would come. Why? So you can break up another brawl? WOMAN: Julie! Oh, hi. How are you? Hey, Summer. Ah... you look... yeah. Hey, Marissa. Hi, Luke. Hey. Cohen, how you doing? It's good to see you. It is? So this is your place? It's beautiful. Oh, thank you. Marissa, something to drink? Sure. Okay, he got shot in the arm, not the head. Come on. Don't you want to show me off? MAN: I'm in private equity and portfolios. Really? Private equity and portfolio management. Sounds fascinating. It's a great party. Everybody seems to be having a good time. Almost everybody. Oh, look, look, I... I wish I could tell you I'm sorry, but I'm not. Okay, worst apology ever. You know I'm no good at those. Look, the important thing is it's out there. You spoke your mind. No, you spoke my mind. Oh, I thought we had an understanding. I thought this is what we both wanted. It is. It was. I knew it. You're backing down. He's been doing this for 20 years. My dad isn't the reason we stayed here. We are. We chose this. If you're telling me that all this time you've been unhappy, that this isn't what you want, then this is a much bigger conversation. How's that going? It's great. It's Jimmy. Excuse me. I told you not to come. What the hell are you doing here?! Hey, hey, I got a plan, okay? Just take it easy. A chance for everything to go back to the way it was. You built a time machine? Caleb Nichol employs thousands of people, none of them more experienced or qualified as I am. How big a leap can it be from investing in stocks to investing in real estate? You're not seriously considering asking him for a job. Why not? This whole community thinks you're a criminal, Jimmy. Caleb Nichol owns the community. What makes you think he feels differently? He loves me since I was a kid. He taught me how to sail. Junior high, tried to convince me to propose to Kirsten. Please, don't even think of talking to him. Look, I'm sorry, but if there's a chance that I can save this family, I'm going to take it. This party rocks. I cannot believe David Manpearl is here. Who? He's senior vice-president of wealth management division at Mckenna. You know, the venture capitalist firm. He manages wealth... as a job! I've been reading Forbes. I see. So, you chose Luke, huh? Chino didn't stand a chance. I told you Luke was the one. No, you didn't. Well, I meant to. You guys are all over each other. Did you? Did it happen? No. His willpower is amazing. The fact that you haven't had sex... Summer! Coop, what more do you want? He's beautiful, sweet, totally crazy about you. What are you waiting for? I don't know. Well, you better figure it out because he is not going to be able to wait forever. What are you doing? Nothing. Somebody's hiding. No, I'm just, uh... Bored. Me, too. I've heard. She's just a girl. I know. So why are you hiding from her? I'm not. I don't believe you. (moans) Still bored? Not so much. (door opens) Sorry. I... I thought... Sorry. Hey, babe, I was look... Let's go. Yeah, okay. We can go to my place. My parents went to Palm Springs. Yeah, sure. Great. (tires squeal) Pharmaceuticals? Isn't that the largest growing industry in North America? Remember the old days, Jimmy? Where has the time gone? Great to see you again. As always. Hey. Congratulations. Looks like you got yourself a job, huh? Oh, yeah. Caleb couldn't have been nicer when he said there's no way he could hire me. Well, hate to say I told you so. No, you don't. Where you going? To finish what you started. Happy birthday, Cal. Julie, thank you. I'll call you next week, huh? How are you? Oh, well, I'm sure you've heard. Kirsten's brought you up to speed. I'm really sorry... about everything. I really liked your husband. Soon to be ex-husband. You can't expect me to stay with him. Not after he's lied to me and left us with nothing. Nothing? Yeah. I suppose I'm gonna have to get a job doing God-knows-what. It's not like I have any marketable skills. Oh, I'm sure that's not true. You know, if there's anything I can do for you or the girls... Oh... you're very, very sweet. And very busy. I just wanted to say "Happy Birthday." I'm never too busy for you. We'll have dinner-- figure something out. I'd like that. Thank you. Hey. What are you doing? I need you to introduce... Okay, you know what, Summer, uh, no. What? This whole night all you've done is use me to meet rich guys. That's not true. Okay, maybe a little. Do you have any idea how pathetic it is to sit and listen to you babble about mergers and acquisitions while some guy stares at your boobs? Which guy was staring at my boobs? Who cares? Listen to me. The point is, if that guy doesn't know you, he doesn't care about who you really are. He has no idea that every day of third grade you shared lunch with that skinny squirrel who kept getting his nuts stolen by that fat squirrel. I hated that mean squirrel. None of them were there when you had to read your poem your hand was shaking because you were nervous, you cared what the other kids thought. Poem? What poem? Okay, I Wish I was a Mermaid. You remember that? That was, like, sixth grade. "I... "wish I was a mermaid and... "was friends with all the fish, "A shiny tail and seashells, that would be... ...my wish." Oh, I got to go. There's that investment banker from Woodward and McDonough. It's okay. I'll introduce myself. The greatest party ever. She has no intention of quitting. Didn't sound that way to me. I wish she would so we... could get the hell away from you. If you're looking for a fight... Save it. We both know the reason you're punishing her is 'cause she is doing so well without you. You're afraid she'll not need you to tell her how to run the company, or her family-- I got news for you. She's better than you at both. If you don't wanna lose her, let her keep doing what she's doing. You'll stay rich, she'll be happy, and I'll... I'll figure out a way to make it work. I need a corkscrew. Have a nice time. Great party, Kiki. Your mom would have loved it. Birthdays, holidays... she always loved a good party. She did. I miss her. I know. Me, too. Your sister-- you ever hear from her? Wanted to invite her, but didn't know where to reach her. The number I have is no longer in service. And then there were two. Aw, you could look at it like that. You're all I got, Kiki. And I'm running you so ragged you haven't got time to talk to me anymore. That's not true, and you know it. I love working for you. I just want you to be proud of me. Taking in a stray kid. That's the sort of thing your mom would have done. Yeah, except she would have done it just to piss you off. (both laughing) Don't be late Monday. Hi. Hi. So I guess she likes you, hmm? I guess she did. You look so sad. I... I'd give anything to be that miserable. 'Cause, if I remember correctly, that's what it feels like to be in love. (panting) I love you so much. Do you...? Are you...? Okay. Yeah? You sure? Yeah. I want to. Should I grab a...? Yeah. Okay. Do you want me to walk you in? No. Thanks. I love you. Love you, too. (sighs) You're too late. by paulonline
