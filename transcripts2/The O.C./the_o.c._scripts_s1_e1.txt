 Hands up! Get them up! On the dash where I can see them! Let's go! Ryan. Sandy Cohen. The court's appointed me your public defender. You could do worse. You okay? They treating you alright? Where's my brother? Uh... Trey is over 18. Trey stole a car, Trey had a gun in his pants an ounce of pot in his jacket, a couple of priors. I'm guessing, right now, Trey's looking at three to five years. But Trey's not my concern. This is your first time in lockup.

 I'm assuming you don't plan on coming back. Your grades... are not great. Suspended twice for fighting, truancy three times... Your test score is 98 percentile on your SAT I's? Ryan, 98 percentile, if you start going to class, are you thinking about college? Have you given any thought at all to your future? Dude... I'm on your side. Come on. Help me out here. Modern medicine is advancing to the point where the average human life span will be 100. But I read this article which said Social Security is supposed to run out by the year 2025, which means people are gonna have to stay in their jobs until they're 80. So I don't want to commit to anything too soon. Look, I can plead this down to a misdemeanor. Petty fine, probation. But know this: stealing a car  'cause your brother told you to, it's stupid and weak. Those are two things you can't afford to be. Two more things. You wanna change that? Then you've to get over the fact that life dealt you a bad hand. I get it. We're cut from the same deck. I grew up, no money, bad part of the Bronx. My father was gone, my mother was always working. I was pissed off. I was stupid. And look at you now. Smart kid like you, you got to have a plan. Some kind of a dream. Yeah, right. Let me tell you something, okay? Where I'm from, having a dream doesn't make you smart. Knowing it won't come true... that does. My office will contact you about the date for your hearing. I'll remember. Unbelievable! What kind of family I got, huh? What the hell did I do to deserve this family? You want to tell me that? Mrs. Atwood? I'm Sandy Cohen. I'm Ryan's attorney. You should have let him rot in there. Just like his dad's doing. Just like his brother's going to. Let's go, Ryan. Now, Ryan! I'm gonna give you my card. My home number. If you need somebody. if things get to be too much. call me. Let's go! Alright! I can't do this anymore, Ryan. I can't. I'm sorry, Mom. I want you out of my house. I want you out! But Mom, where am I going to go? You heard her, man. Get your stuff and get out. Hey, this isn't your house, man. Oh, you're a tough guy now? A.J., don't. Ryan, just get out. Why don't you worry about your own kids? Instead of freeloading off my mom? Hey! Hey! (theme music) (music continues) Hey. Can I crash with you tonight? All right. Fine. I need a place to crash tonight. I already tried it. I already tried it! I told you. You could do worse. This is a nice car. Didn't know your kind of lawyer made money. No, we don't. My wife does. (theme music continues) Um... you know, why don't you wait here for a minute? I'll be back. It's no fun if the key's in the car. WOMAN: You brought him home? This is not a stray puppy, Sandy. I know that, Kirsten. I knew it was only a matter of time before you started bringing home felons. Ryan's not a felon. Did you not meet him in jail? Yes, technically, but it wasn't for a felony. It was, but it won't be when I'm done. You're endangering our home. Did you even think of Seth? It's only for the weekend. Just till Child Services opens on Monday... What if it's all a scam? What if he's just using you to case the house? He's not a criminal mastermind. He's a kid who has no one and nowhere to go. When did you become so cynical? When did you become so self-righteous? I've always been self-righteous. You used to find it charming. He sleeps in the pool house. Where you going? To put my jewelry in the vault. Where do you think I'm going? The boy's going to need fresh sheets and towels and a toothbrush. (piano music) Who are you? Whoever you want me to be. Okay. Hey, can I bum a cigarette? (click) (music continues) So, what are you doing here, seriously? Seriously? I stole a car. Crashed it. Actually, my brother did. Since he had a gun and drugs on him, he's in jail. I got out, and my mom threw me out. She was pissed off and drunk. So Mr. Cohen took me in. You're their cousin from Boston, right? Right. Hi, Marissa. Hey, Mr. Cohen. I was just meeting your nephew. Oh! My favorite nephew. Ryan. All the way from Seattle. Seattle? Dad live there. Mom lives in Boston. Hmm. So we're all really excited about your fashion show fund-raiser for tomorrow night. Really? You are? No. (laughs) (song playing on car stereo) Come on. Let's go. Hey, you should come by, check it out... if you don't have other plans. See you. Goodnight. (song continues) Who's that kid? Let's go inside. Uh, there's no smoking in this house. So this is where you'll be staying. And this is the queen of the manor herself, my wife, Kirsten. Hello, Ryan. Welcome to our home. If you need anything Rosie here can help you. Thank you. Thanks very much. We'll see you in the morning. Make yourself comfortable. (footsteps fading) (instrumental music) (music continues) Hey. Hey. Do you want to play? Someone's trying to be a hero, but he got a little cocky. X-O, X-O-- it's an unbeatable combination. Oh! Oh! Oh...! What happened to your head? Where did it go? I'm sorry. Did someone die? You wanna play Grand Theft Auto? It's pretty cool. You can, like, steal cars and... Not that that's cool... or uncool. I don't know. Um... I see you two have met. Seth, why're you inside on this beautiful day? Why don't you show Ryan around? Okay. 'Cause it's so great around here. There's so much to do. I don't know, unless, what do you want to do? What do you guys do around here? (upbeat music) (Slightly Stoopid singing "Sweet Honey") * You see me laughin' Cause it's kinda funny to me * * The way she say she never give her lovin' for free * * She say she got a man why she lookin' at me * * Yes she want a lover with the sensitivity * * But wont you tell me that your loves from the heart * * Yes the type of lovin' that can tear a man apart * * Girl you got to realize before it ever starts... * I have, uh... this plan. I don't-I don't know what you'd think but, um, next July, the trade winds shift west and I want to sail to Tahiti. I could do it in 44 days. Maybe even 42. Wow. That... that sounds really cool, man. Yeah. Hit the high seas, catch fish right off the side of the boat. Grill them right there. Just total quiet. Solitude. You won't get lonely? Well, I'll have Summer with me. You're going to take this to Tahiti? (chuckles) Um... no. It's the girl the boat's named after. She must be pretty stoked. Yeah. She has no idea. I've never talked to her before. Hey, fellas. Thought we'd go to the fashion show at 7:00. Yeah. Have fun. Come on. It's a whole new school year, Seth. It's also the same kids, Dad. Why do they need a fashion show? Every day's a fashion show for them. Yeah, well, Ryan has to go. Marissa invited him. Marissa invited you? I've lived next door to Marissa since, like, forever. Her dad almost got married to my mom, even, and she's never even invited me to her birthday. That is not true. They did not almost get married. Eh. Hey, maybe Summer would be there. That's interesting. She is Marissa's best friend. 7:00? 7:00. 7:00. (soft music) (doorbell rings) Hello, again. My dad's not here. And when can we expect him? I don't know. Mm-hmm. Well, then, when you see your father, can you please remind him again how much we'd like to talk? Let me leave you another one of my cards. Have a good day. Hey. Thanks, kiddo. I just didn't have time to deal with those guys right now. Who are they? (sighs) Suits. Bureaucrats. "The Man." (laughs) But, I mean, everything's okay, right? Yeah, it's just... it's just a thing with a... with a client. Nothing for you to worry about, okay? (sighs) (tapping on glass) (door opening) Wow, look at that. Fits you beautifully. Where's your tie? I'm not going to wear one. Open collar-- it's a good look. I didn't know how to tie a tie till I was 25. Come on. Give me your tie. Button your top button. Alright, collar up. Now, the skinny side has got to be shorter than the fat side. How much shorter, it changes tie to tie. Sometimes, it's just a mystery. Alright. So you got to hang out with Seth? How was that? Was that...? Was that... alright? He's an interesting kid if you get to know him. He's cool. Cool, huh? Alright. There we go. Turn around. Look at you. Huh? Beats a jumpsuit. Oh, Mom, do you like my nails? Oh, I love them, Caitlin. Do you like my hair this straight or is it too Avril Lavigne? No, it looks good, Mom. Oh, Marissa, you look... Oh, honey, I thought you were gonna wear your hair down. Pulled back like that, it's a little harsh on your angles. Okay. Let's go. It's gonna be so amazing tonight. Are you gonna wear the Donna Karan, Mariss? I thought it was very forgiving. You look beautiful, kiddo. (soft music) Mushroom-leek crescent? Crab and brie phyllo? Welcome to the dark side. Oh! So, you must be the cousin from Boston, hmm? I don't know how you do it. I could just never live there. I hate the cold. (chuckles) Do you... like Seattle? I mean, all that rain. Isn't it depressing? Did I hear you were from Canada? Yes, you did. Hmm. Hi. Can I, uh, can I get a Seven and Seven? Sure. (music continues) Thanks. Thank you. I want my husband to be right about you. What's up? Lock it up, Norland. Lock it up, Luke. Hey, Luke. What's up? Hey! Hey. Yeah. Suck it, queer. My vacation was great, too. Thank you for asking about it. (indistinct chattering) Summer's right over there. Look. I'm sorry. Wait. Don't look. But I mean, you can look, but don't look like you're looking. Hey, Dad. Hey, guys. Who is that? Um... the cousin. The pool boy. (laughs): I don't know. Well, I'm going to find out. Is that Summer? You know, um, I'm going to, uh, sit. Way to salt his game, Mr. Cohen. Hello, Chester. Are these seats taken? Okay. Chester, are you looking forward to your next sailing lesson? You're making some really good strides. Okay, I'm glad we had this little chance to catch up, you know? (applause) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all so much for coming. Every year, we put on a fashion show to raise money for the battered women's shelter. It's such a good cause, you guys, and we couldn't do any of it without your support, and the support of Fashion Island and all their great stores. (upbeat techno music playing) Alright, enjoy the show! * All around the world * Hey, girl (applause) * Zippers and your pearls * When I walk through the door I'm a debutante * She's got Tahiti written all over her. (moans) * We jet to Ibiza, the people are shrieking... * Has anybody seen my Betsey Johnson dress? (indistinct chatter) WOMAN: Alright. Oh, no. Much too much makeup. Let's go. What are you doing putting my daughter in Calvin Klein? She was supposed to wear Vera Wang. She would if she had the chest to hold it up. It's called puberty, honey. It'll happen. Okay, girls, chop-chop. Show time. (techno music playing) Marissa, you're next. Look what I stole. Look what I stole. (gasps): Alright! Here. Thanks. * When I walk through the door, I'm a debutante * * When I come through the door, I'm a debutante * * All around the world * Hey, girl * Zippers and your pearls * When I walk through the door, I'm a debutante * * When I come through the door, I'm a debutante * * When I walk through the door, I'm a debutante * * When I come through the door, I'm a debutante * * When I walk through the door, I'm a debutante * * When I come through the door, I'm a debutante... * She's so beautiful, you guys.

(chuckling) You okay, Jimmy? Uh, yeah, I just, uh, it's... it's a little stuffy in here. Honey, I, uh, I'm going to get some fresh air, okay? Marissa wanted to wear these Prada Mary Janes, but I told her she had to wear the stiletto Manolos. (laughs) (latch rattling) (groaning) (Jimmy sobbing) * Hey, girl Hey. Hey. Where you going? My friend, Holly... No, well, her parents are letting us use their beach house as a gift, you know, 'cause of all our hard work for charity. If you need a ride... or... anything... I'm Summer. Hey. Hey, you ready to go? Yeah. We should go to that party at that girl Holly's place. Uh, yeah, no, that's alright. Summer... invited me. Really? She did? Us. Uh, she... she asked for you, actually. Really? She did? Come on! (girls whooping) That makes absolutely no sense, but, yes, we should go. We're going to go with them. Thanks, Gus.

(laughing): Oops. Hey. I'm wasted. So, what's your name anyway? Ryan. Ryan, you got to come, um... What are you doing? Hey, um... Excuse me? What are you doing? I named my boat after her. (laughs): What? Eww... Who are you? It's not what you think. She's a little drunk. Come on, Ryan. Seth, Seth, Seth. Don't touch me. Why don't you just go back to Chino? I'm sure there's a nice car in the parking lot that you could steal. (laughs): Chino? Eww. * And I can make love like paradise... * * I'm a player... (indistinct chattering) Go home, geek. Who invited you? You guys really wouldn't hurt me, 'cause that'd be so cliched. Ah! I guess you're fans of the cliche. Shut up. Hey, hey! Put him down! Put him down. (groans) (gasps): Whatsup? Put him down. Hey, what's up, dude? You got a problem? You tell me. (grunting) Whoa! (grunts) Ooh! (laughing) GIRL: Whoo! Welcome to the O.C., bitch. This is how it's done at Orange County. Well, I... I don't know what to say... except that you totally had my back out there. We're, like, in a fight club or something. I don't know. You know what I think? Ryan, I think that, if you were to teach me some moves, I think we could totally take 'em next time. That's what I think. A little bit of that. And a little bit of that and that. What do you think about that? Yeah. Oh, also, that wasn't exactly the way that I first planned to talk to Summer, but I am now on her radar. Do you think I should tell her about Tahiti? Do you? Not yet. That's what I thought. That's what I was thinking. I wanted to make sure, like, we were on the same page. Quite a little night we had there. I'm not going to forget it. Ryan, I'm not going to forget that one. (crickets chirping) (soft music) (crickets chirping) (giggling) I can't believe her. I swear to God, she is so retarded sometimes. Shouldn't her boyfriend be doing this? He's so worthless. Oh, oh! (giggling) Shh! (laughing) Coop, where are your keys? How are we going to find her keys? I can't find her keys. We can't wake her parents. Her dad'll go ballistic. I know, I know. Bye, Coop. (grunts) Call us. Shh. (giggling) (whispering): Hey. Get your keys. (piano music) (soft guitar strumming) * Still * Falling * Breathless and on * Again * Inside * Today * Beside me * Today Thank God. (sighs) What happened to your face? Mmm. I got into a fight. With who? Why? I don't really know. I don't really remember. Um... I was really drunk. Yeah. I think I still am a little bit. Let's go. House. Oh. Now! Later. Oh, honey, you should've seen the waves coming in. Six foot, and it was going off... Seth got into a fight. He did? That's what happens when you let people like him in and let Seth hang out with criminals. At least he has someone to hang out with. Don't salt his game, honey. What the hell does that mean? I-I... It... I don't know. I just know that I'd rather Seth hanging out with Ryan than some trust fund kid from here who only cares about getting a new Beemer every year. There's a whole world outside this Newport Beach bubble. You don't seem to mind living in this bubble. I-I know there's something else out there. You remember when we were 22? You said you'd never be like your parents. You'd never have their life. I was 22. I stank of patchouli. I lived in the back of a mail truck. And you were fun. And rebellious, and... and... you married me. I can't. I'm sorry. I don't want this kid in my house anymore. Where is he supposed to go? He has a family, Sandy. It's not up to you to decide whether or not they're good enough. Look, Ryan, I don't mean to play bad cop. It's nothing personal. Is that bacon? I usually make breakfast at my house. My mom's not much of a cook, so... I'm sorry. You seem like a really nice kid. It's okay. I get it. You have a really nice family. (knocking) Hey, man. Hey. Hi. So... I got to jet. Are you leaving? So... Mmm. So, what's up? I got to go back. Try to figure some stuff out back home. Okay. Well... cool. Or... not cool, but, you know... what I think I mean. Come here. I'll come down to Chino. You know, I'll visit you, and you can show me your world. Or your hood or... (laughs) Alright. Wait a second. Just wait one second. Um... Maybe there's someplace you want to go. It's pretty good for ideas. Ah! (chuckles softly) Okay. (guitar music) * Don't know why I'm still afraid * * If you weren't real, I would make you up * * Now * I wish that I could follow through * * I know that your love is true and deep as the sea * * But right now * Everything you want is wrong, and right now * * All your dreams are waking up * * And right now * I wish I could follow you * To the shore of * Freedom * Where no one lives * Run away * Run away tonight * Freedom * Freedom * Run away * Run away tonight... So, thanks. For everything. I'm going to make sure everything works out, Ryan. It's okay. I can take it from here. (slow-paced music) (music continues) Come on. Let's go.
