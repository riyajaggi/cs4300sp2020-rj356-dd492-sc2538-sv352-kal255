You were kissing her. Yeah, Beave, we saw ya. I was not kissing her. She was kissing me. It's the same thing. You better watch it, boy. Yeah, you better watch it, Beave. — Watch what? — Kissing married women. Suppose her husband found out. Yeah, suppose her husband found out —You mean he might not like it? — Might not like it? You see what happens in the movies all the time. [Cutting Noise] Oh, hi. Where's Wally? He and Eddie went to play ball with the big kids. Oh. Dad, what you doin'? I'm putting a new plug on the toaster. Your mother always pulls it out by the cord instead of by the plug. Oh. Dad, you're real smart. You know all about 'tricity. I know enough to stay just about One jump ahead of your mother. Dad? Mm—hmm. You're a married man, aren't you? Yeah, I think we're safe in assuming that. Uh—huh. And Mom's a married woman, isn't she? Oh, yes. Have you ever kissed any other married woman besides Mom? Well, now, Beaver, why would you ask a question like that? I'm just wondering. Well, actually, Son, no. I guess you were scared to, huh? Yeah, that's as good a way as any to sum it up, I guess. I guess a guy could get in a lot of trouble doing that, huh? Yeah, he sure could. Uh, Beaver, I've got to finish this plug, Son. Now, uh, you run on outside and play. I think I'll stay in the house for the rest of the day. Beaver, you go outside and play. Yes, sir. Yeah. Having a talk with the Beaver? No, he was having a talk with me. You know it's funny the way their little minds work. He wanted to know If I'd ever kissed a married woman. What'd you tell him? Well, I told him no. Ward. Mm—hmm. Why haven't you ever kissed any married women? Now you know why, honey. [Chuckles] I was scared to. Flowers? The little boy next door brought 'em over this morning. Oh, yes, I've noticed him. He's a cute little fella. He's about Julie's age, isn't he? Uh—huh. I thought if we're having Julie for the weekend, we might ask him over. That way she'd have someone to play with. Good idea. Listen, I'll be working outside. |f| see him, I'll tell him. You know, it's not a bad idea to get in good with the neighbors' kids. You know his name? Beaver. Beaver? Beaver. Beaver. Come here. I wanna talk to you. Harry. Did you talk to the little fellow? Well, I tried to, but he took off like a greyhound. I think he must be the shy type. Oh, dear. Well, did you call your sister about Julie coming over? Oh, yeah, she's so excited about meeting him. You know, I think the name Beaver kind of intrigued her. Why don't you call his mother? What about? Well, if he's so shy about girls, maybe we can ﬁnd a way to lure him over. You know, we would have won if— Hey, Beave, what are you doin'? Watching for Mr. Donaldson. He was gonna cut my head off. No foolin'? Yes. He came after me with the hedge clippers. — Uh—oh. — It's just like you and Eddie said, Wally. [Cutting Noise] I told you there was something creepy about him. But, Eddie, he wouldn't get jealous over a little squirt like Beaver. I'm not leaving this room fora hundred years. Hey, Eddie, we still giving him the business? Heck no. This is for real. You know how many guys get shot Every year by jealous husbands? How many? Couple hundred in California alone. Yeah? Beaver? Gee, Mrs. Cleaver, that's a nice dress. I know, Eddie. I know. Eddie, I'm afraid you're gonna have to go home now. Beaver has to take a bath. And then, honey, I want you to put on your best suit. You've been invited over to the Donaldsons. Oh. Hurry up, Beaver. You're gonna be late. Now remember, not a word about the Donaldsons' little niece being there. I promised Mrs. Donaldson. [Footsteps Approaching] Well, Beaver, you look very nice. Mom, do I have to go? What's the matter? Don't you feel well? Oh, I feel ﬁne, except my head sort of hurts. Why would your head hurt? I think I fell down at recess today. Beaver, today is Saturday. You didn't go to school. [Chuckles] Then I guess I didn't fall down at recess. Now, here's a present to take over to the Donaldsons. It's a yo—yo. For Mrs. Donaldson? Well, you—you just take it on over there. Now hurry up. You're gonna have a wonderful time. Mrs. Donaldson thinks you're a very nice little boy. |wish she thought I was an awful little boy. Beaver, hurry up. It's not polite to keep people waiting. Okay. Bye, Mom. Mm, good—bye, darling. Good—bye, Dad. Tell Wally I said good—bye. Well, you almost gave it away with that yo—yo. I know. I wonder where Mrs. Donaldson got that impression, I don't know. He doesn't know enough about life to be afraid of women. Psst! It's us, Beave. Come here, kid. Listen. Mr. Donaldson left a half hour ago. Now, I don't know what's going on in there, but you being alone with his wife, I just don't like the setup. Me neither. Do you think something's gonna happen? |don't like that Mr. Donaldson. [Wally] Look, as long as he ’s out, he can ’t do anything to ya. [Eddie] Anyway, we ’re gonna be right outside here. How am I gonna know you're gonna be right outside here? Look, every couple of minutes, we'll give you the old signal. Yeah, as long as the coast is clear, we'll give you the old signal. Gee, thanks. [Wally] Yeah, you’d better go in now Yeah, she'll be 'specting me. You think something's really gonna happen, Eddie? Happen? When that guy comes home and ﬁnds Beaver alone with his wife, he might pull a gun. [Doorbell Rings] A gun, Eddie? Sure. And there'll be shooting all over the place and bullets ﬂyin' and— Listen. I told my mother I'd be home. Call me up and let me know what happens. Well, Beaver, come in. My, aren't you a big boy in your gray suit? No, I'm not. I'm just a little squirt. My, what have we here? It's for you. It's a yo—yo. Well, Thank you. Aren't you gonna open it? Well, I think we can wait till later. Won't you sit down? Is it a birthday? No, no birthday. Where's Mr. Donaldson? Well, he's not here right now. We're alone. You mean, just me and you and the cake? Mm—hmm. What's the matter? I don't think I like the setup. Now, Beaver, I don't want you to be shy with me. After all, we're going to be neighbors. [Wally Wailing] What in the world was that? That's an owl. I saw it on the way over here. I had an itch. [Wally Wailing] What in the world was that? It sounded like an owl. It didn't sound enough like an owl to be an owl. [Wailing Continues] Would you like some taffy, Beaver? No, thanks. I already “losted” one tooth this week. Well, then perhaps you'd care for a mint. Okay. Thank you. How old are you, Beaver? Seven. That's why my teeth are falling out. Oh, I see. Is it true you don't like girls? Beaver, | asked you if— Well, aren't you going to give me an answer? Well, I, uh— What was the question? Is it true you don't like girls? I like Angela Valentine. Oh, you do? She has an extra toe. Oh, really? It doesn't have a toenail, but you can see it's a toe. Well, that's very interesting, Beaver. It certainly is. [Wailing] [Wailing Continues] May I ask what you're doing? Shh! Oh, uh, Dad. Well, I, uh— I come out to look for night crawlers. With a periscope? Well, they're kinda hard to ﬁnd. Wally, I'm surprised at you. Coming over here, bothering your brother just because you weren't invited to the Donaldsons. Well, I wasn't bothering him. I was just— —I think you'd better get on in the house. — But— Yeah, I think I'd better. Now, Beaver, suppose we just— [Horn Honks] Oh, excuse me just a minute. That must be Mr. Donaldson now. [Car Door Opens, Closes] You have on such a pretty dress tonight. Thank you. Theodore, I'd like you to meet— Well, that's strange. Well, he was here just a minute ago. He must have gone out this way, but he's not here now. Aunt Betty, what happened? Did the boy with the funny name “runned” away? Well, I can't imagine why he left, dear. Well, come in. Ward it’s the Donaldsons. Well, hello there. We're sorry to trouble you, but, uh, we're looking For your son. Oh, I sent Wally up to his room. Oh, no, we mean the Beaver. Theodore? But he's at your house. Well, he was at our house, but he's not there now. He— He seems to have disappeared. Ward, where could he be? Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back. His father doesn't look like a beaver. Wally, where's the Beaver? Dad, I haven't seen him all evening. I've been studying pretty hard. Yeah. All right, Wally. Wally, aren't those the Beaver's best shoes? Yeah, I guess they are. He must have left them there. He must have left his feet in them too. Hi, Dad. Beaver, what in the world are you doing? Now come on. Get on your feet. Look at your suit, for heaven's sake. The Donaldsons are downstairs looking for you. Now, I want you to come right downstairs and apologize for running away. I don't want to. |don't like that Mr. Donaldson. Well, why don't you like Mr. Donaldson? Well, I just, um— He probably has his reasons, Dad. Yes, I probably have my reasons. I don't wanna go down there. I don't want to. Well, now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Take it easy, Beaver. I'm not gonna force you to do anything you don't want to do. Look,just leave it to me. Now don't worry. Well, it was the most peculiar thing. One minute he was there, and the next minute he was gone. It isn't at all like the Beaver being shy. Well, I hope it isn't anything we said or did. Oh, no, of course not. After all— Oh, Ward, did you ﬁnd him? Oh,yes,yes. He's up in his room. Uh— I'm afraid he's not coming down. We||,we had planned a little party for him with little Julie here. Yeah,yeah, I know. Uh, but you know how children are. Sometimes they develop an aversion to— I mean, uh, sometimes they don't take to people right away. Well, if he's shy about girls, I can understand. Oh, it's not girls. It's, uh— [Chuckles] Well, as a matter of fact, it's you, Mr. Donaldson. [Chuckles] Me? Yes, well, uh, you see, it seems that you— I mean, Beaver seems to think that— You see, I don't know what went on over there, but right now he's upstairs under the bed. Ward, I'm sure it's nothing that Mr. Donaldson did. Oh, I'm sure it's nothing like that. No. Of course not. [June] You know how children are. 0h, Beaver hides under the bed lots of times. Oh, yes, lots of times. You remember when that English bulldog moved in down the street? He— Well, |— You know how children are. Well, I-I guess if he isn't coming down, we can go home. Yeah, well— Good night. Good night. Aunt Betty? Yes, sweetie. Do | get to eat his piece of cake? Well, we'll see about that. We'll see. Have you seen anything of the Donaldsons this morning? No. And I don't think we'll be seeing very much of them in the near future. No, I guess not. You know, I can't recall the Beaver's ever taking such a dislike to anyone. Oh, he'll get over it in time. Do you want more— Ward, come here. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Beaver. What, Mom? I thought you were afraid Mr. Donaldson. Oh, that was last night, Mom. It's all straightened out now, huh? Oh, sure. I was coming in, and he asked me why I was “a—scared” of him. And I told him. Uh— You, uh— You told him? Oh, sure. After| 'splained to him, he said I could kiss his wife anytime I wanted. Kiss his wife anytime. I think I'd better ﬁnd out what this is all about, huh? Just leave it. Just leave it.
