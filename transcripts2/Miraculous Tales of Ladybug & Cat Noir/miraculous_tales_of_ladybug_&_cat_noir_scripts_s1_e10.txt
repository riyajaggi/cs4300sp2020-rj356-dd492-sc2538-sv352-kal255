 In the daytime I'm Marinette, just a normal girl with a normal life, but there's something about me that no-one knows yet because I have a secret. In most fairy tales, the prince breaks the spell by kissing the princess. Who can tell us why? Because only love can conquer hate. Correct. Technically, this is only true in 87% of cases.

 Thank you, Max. Adrien, I hope that's about my lesson. What did I just say? The prince breaks the spell by kissing the princess because love conquers hate. Very good. Don't forget to finish Sleeping Beauty. Happy Valentine's day. I'll meet you outside. OK. Hi, Adrien. Sign here, please. You know I hate signing autographs. That's not what this is. It's a petition against cruelty to hamsters.

 Have you seen the sweaters they're forced to wear? Well, well, Marinette, looking for something to eat? Maybe she's looking for better clothes. Ignore them. They're not worth it. You're right. "Your hair is dark as night, Your pretty bluebell eyes. "I wonder who you are Beneath that strong disguise. "Every day we see each other, I hope that you'll be mine. "Together our love could be so true, Please be my Valentine." Wow, now that's a love poem. Who could it be to? "Hair dark as night", "Bluebell eyes"? Well... you. No way. There are plenty of girls at school with dark hair and blue eyes. Yes, but bluebell eyes? What does he mean by "strong disguise"? This is poetry. He means who you are deep down. He wants to get to know you. He's talking about you. Pinch me. Not literally! Operation Valentine's Day is commencing. According to my research of shopping sites, this jewel was ranked highest in popularity. Perfect. I'll hit a homerun with this one. Love is like baseball, right? You need a strategy. And if you aim right, it's a homerun. - Great metaphor, Kim. - Meta who? Wow, sparkly. Is that for me? No, Alya, it's for someone else, it's... Keep quiet. Scoop! Kim's got a crush. Who's the lucky lady? It's gorgeous, Kim. She'll be ecstatic. She's still gotta accept it. - What if she says no? - She won't. No way, don't hold back. Go for it. No regrets! Operation Valentin's Day is underway. Her route is in yellow, yours is in red. If you run at 10mph, you'll have a 4-minute lead on her. Wait here. It's the 3rd most romantic spot in Paris. - Go, go! - Thanks, guys. I know someone who's good at giving advice, but who can't take any. Let's go. You're right. It's time I told him. Say what? I'm gonna tell him my true feelings. Well, I'll wright them, on a card. Yeah. Yeah. OPERATION VALENTINE'S DAY! Wow, he's so cute. Keep dreaming, girls, but the boy is mine. "To Chloe, the most awesome girl in the world, and the love of my life" signed Adrien. She's not crying enough. "Dear, Adrien"... "Dear, Adrien" "Dear Adrien" I'm no good at this love-letter writing thing. I sound like a dorkasaurus. Only when you say words like "dorkasaurus". Relax, Marinette, I'm teasing. Think of Adrien and speak from the heart. Adrien's letter. Why didn't I think of that before? I'll answer his poem. Marinette? Check... it... out! It's perfect. Oh, thank you, thank you. Voilà. Don't forget to sign it. It's a good omen. Ladybug's are good luck, especially in the love department. Really? Yeah, you of all people should know about ladybugs. Wh-Why do you say that? "The ladybug is a symbol of love, "guiding hearts on the paths of devotion." It's on my blog. Didn't you read it? Yes, of course. So, she's got eyes, arms, legs... Big deal. How can you be in love with Ladybug? You don't even know who she is. You know nothing about love. Sure I do. I love cheddar, Swiss... and I love camembert. The poor boy's frustrated because he can't finish the poem for his masked sweetheart. I don't need a poem. I can tell her to her face. I love you. That's gross. You're making me lose my appetite. Almost. That's right, in a 24-carat frame. Deliver it to Le Grand Paris Hotel and bill it to daddy. I mean Mr Bourgeois. What are you doing here? I-I... You... you... Will you... be my Valentine? Don't move. Wait til people see this. No offence, Kim, my heart's saved for someone more awesome. Don't you just hate how harsh love can be? Valentine's Day, the day of love and the day of fools. So many delusions, so much disappointment. My evil Akumas, you are going to have such a field-day. Fly away, my little Akuma, and evilise him. Dark Cupid, I am Hawk Moth. I can give you the power to shoot your arrows, pierce love and impale friendships. But, there's something you must do for me in return. No love affair or friendship will escape my fury. No-one will love again! Stupid flowers. Get off me! Perfect. Soon, Ladybug and Cat Noir will show up to meet their doom. Candy-apples, girls? Thanks, dad. Come on, do it before you chicken out. I did it. Chloe? Since when did she start texting us? What a witch! And I was the one who told Kim to do it. I didn't know he was talking about her. I hope Adrien doesn't do that to you. I mean... What have I done? Girl, calm down. I was joking... kind of. Adrien would never do that. What is that? All hearts must be destroyed! Ayla? Hey, seriously? You're not my BFF. You're a joke! Adrien will laugh his head off at your lame attempt at poetry. Alya? What did he do to her? I've seen that jewel before. It's Kim's pin. He's been akumatised. This is... not good. We've gotta find him fast. Tikki, spots on! I never said 18-carat gold. The tones will never match my 24-carat toilet. Idiots! - Ladybug! - Stop, Kim. I'm not Kim, I'm Dark Cupid. I'll never stop. If I can't have love then no-one can. OK, I get it. Chloe burned you. You don't have to take it out on all of Paris. Yes I do. I won't stop til all hearts are crushed. Say adios to your loved ones, now you'll hate them. If you want to continue destroying love, bring me Ladybug's Miraculus. Or I'll remove your powers. Fallen for me already? - I need to talk to you. - It's gotta wait... I swore I'd tell you as soon as I saw you. Ladybug, I-I... Look out! Cat Noir? Ladybug, I... I loathe you! Cat Noir, snap out of it. You're nothing to me, Ladybug, I hate you. Ladybug, it's about time. Where have you been? Offer to help him in return for Ladybug's Miraculous. I can help you crush Ladybug but you must give me her Miraculus. No... problem. Yes... yes. Once I have Ladybug's Miraculus, taking Cat Noir's will be child's play! You have to leave. Kim's turned into Dark Cupid. He can't find you here. Me? But how could he have a vendetta against me? Who doesn't? It's because of this. Everyone would love to have it. That's Adrien, a super-hot guy in my class, and rich too. He's hot for me, of course. Not according to the poem. It's alive! Chloe, run! Well, well, Ladybug. I don't want to fight you. That friendliness is so revolting. You're not my friend. Why are you so full of hate? Because hate conquers all. I hate to burst your bubble, but hate doesn't conquer all, love does. The prince breaks the spell by kissing the princess. Only love conquers hate. You're just buying time... Fight! I'll do better than that. Come on, kitty-kitty, just a peck. Almost. Get back, you savage. Here, kitty-kitty, come here. You can't outrun me. Help. Happy Valentine's Day, Chloe. Now you'll get what you deserve. My hair! There's nothing worse than a bad-hair day. First, Ladybug wrinkles my jacket, second, you totally ruined my hair. Go ahead and change me. This day can't get any worse. I don't need to waste my arrow on you. Your heart is so dark and shrivelled there's no room for love. How dare you? Why are you just standing there? Help me up! You think I'd help someone as stuck up as you? Wait til people see this. No, no! I'm not looking forward to it either. I can't believe I'm doing this. How you gonna fight both of us now, bug-eyes? Cataclysm! I often wonder what my cataclysm will do to someone. Lucky charm! A candy-apple? What am I supposed to do with this? Think, ladybug. Hey. I've a Valentine's gift for you. Looks like you're in a sticky situation. Ladybug! And now for the pussycat. Cat Noir, her Miraculus. With pleasure. Finally, I'll find out who you are. Your secret will be out of the bag. Wh-What am I doing here? No time, the quiver pin, Cat Noir, now! Grab the pin! - No - Sorry, need that. Happy Valentine's Day. You shouldn't have... Woops. No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma. Time to de-evilise. Gotcha! Bye-bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! What the heck am I doing? What the heck are you doing? I-I have no idea. POUND IT! Woops. Wait, I gotta tell you something. Look, the kiss... I had to break the spell. What? A kiss? What kiss? I just wanted to say... Your ring's flashing. Yours too. We're about to turn into pumpkins. And I'd rather not see that. Blasted Ladybug! Blasted Valentin's Day! Hey, there's your chance to get your card back. - That was before. - Before what? I realised that even with all this hate, love still wins. If I wanna win-over Adrien, he needs to know the truth. This is a big day. Can you believe all the horrible, thoughtless things you said? You think it's funny? What's the big deal? You've got so many cards from all these lady-fans, just take your pick. Someone answered my poem? But I threw it away. "Your hair shines like the sun, Your eyes are gorgeous green, "I look at you and wonder, Your innermost thoughts and dreams. "Your Valentine, I will be, Our love will be so true, "Together for eternity, My heart belongs to you." Anyone who writes as sickeningly sweet as you must be your soulmate. It isn't signed. Could it have come from Ladybug? Oh, please. What? You don't remember? Did you sign it or not? I don't know. The ladybug came while I was writing, Then you were yapping about your blog. It's all a blur. I don't believe you. The girl didn't even sign it! I love you, but sometimes, you seriously bug. You know that, right?
