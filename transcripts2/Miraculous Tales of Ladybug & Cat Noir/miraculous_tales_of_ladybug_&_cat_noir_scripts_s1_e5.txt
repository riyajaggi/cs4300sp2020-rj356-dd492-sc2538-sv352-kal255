 Imagine that. Hey, Adrien. Would you like to... [spluttering] Exactly. I can't help it. Every time I see him, I get all clammy and I feel like fainting. So you have to be blindfolded to have a normal conversation with him? Pretty much. There is a simple solution. It's called a phone. You just need his number. I know who'll have it. I'm sure you've outdone yourself, Theo. It was my honor. I can't wait to meet Ladybug. I hope she signs my photo.

 I used it as the inspiration for the statue. It's nearly time. Ladybug and Cat Noir should already be here by now. We know improv's not your bag, so stick to this script. The teachers say I don't sound natural when I read Then memorize it. It's pretty simple. You can do it. Just don't improvise, got it? Forget it. It's never gonna work. Too late. It's dialing. [Ayla giggles] Hey, this is Adrien's voicemail, leave a message. It's gone to voicemail. Leave a message. Don't improv'. Hello, Adrien's voicemail... This is Marinette... who... has a message... for you, of course, because it's your phone, so... [she giggles] Call me, see you later, bye. What did you expect? "Hey, hot stuff. It's Marinette. "I'd ask you out "but I've got such a crush on you that the only way to talk to you "is over this stupid phone." Pretty ridiculous, right? To hear your message, press 1. To erase your message, press 2. Hit 2! Hit 2! Message saved. Goodbye. [she sobs] It's not as bad as you think. Ok, it's bad, but you had to tell him one day, some way or another. Think of it this way, no more secrets. The voicemail recorded my whole conversation. -Big deal. -I called him hot stuff. He can't hear that message, Alya. If he does, I'll die of shame. OK, I've an idea. If his phone went to voicemail, it means he's busy. That means you can get to it before he does. I wonder where he'd be? Of course. He's got fencing after school. That's why he didn't pick up. It ends in 22.5 minutes. You're insane. You know that, right? You have one new message. I gotta get a drink. Be right back. Plagg! You pig! [he burps] You have one new message. Move please, so I can check my voicemail. I don't recognize this number. Oh no, we're late! Time to transform, Plagg. [excited yelling] Yeah! Hey, everybody. They're unveiling Ladybug and Cat Noir sculptures today. I totally spaced. Me too. You never mentioned going to the unveiling. I'm not, I mean I am... I mean, I forgot? Listen, about Adrien's cell phone... What if we go after? After the ceremony, his fencing training will be over, and he'll have his phone back by then. Shoot. I gotta cover this event for the Ladyblog. I'm sorry, Marinette. Don't sweat it. I can manage... I think. -You sure? -Yes, yes, I'm sure. Cool, good luck. Stay out of trouble. And don't improv'. [car horn] Isn't Ladybug supposed to be at the unveiling? Yes, but Marinette needs to be at the school first. But it is a ceremony in your honor. And it's my honor that's at stake. I'll be in and out in 5 minutes. We can be at the ceremony in no time. Excuse me Cat Noir, but Ladybug's not here. Don't worry. She'll be here soon. I can handle it for now. I'm the one in charge anyway. I wanted to ask her to sign this photo. She's amazing. She's so brave... And smart... The way she saves everyone. Perhaps we should commence. It might bring her here faster. Just a minute more, Mayor Bourgeois. She is going to come. I can feel it. In there. [Tikki] Oh boy. Which one's his? Call him. His phone will ring. Nice, Tikki. [phone rings] It's only proper for Paris to pay homage to those who protect us. [Mayor] Ladybug and Cat Noir. Can I get some photos? [Tikki] Hurry, they're finishing up. [phone rings] Here it is. It's locked! Ta-da! These statues are amazing but one thing's off. I'm actually taller than her. Ladybug didn't show. I just wanted to... express my adoration for her. Let her know that everything I had went into her statue.. If she took time to get to know me, she'd see how much we have in common, our devotion to the things we love. Hey, don't mean to burst your bubble, but you know, Ladybug and I, we're a thing, you know. -Really? -Yeah, we're like this. What does Ladybug see in him? [phone bleeps] They're coming. Forget it. I haven't erased it yet. We're out of time. We have to get to the ceremony. That was rough. [Cat Noir whistles] "A thing"? You don't even take love seriously calling it "a thing". You don't deserve her. I do! [evil voice] Disappointed by Ladybug and jealous of Cat Noir, the perfect formula for disaster. Fly away, my little Akuma, and evilize him. Hello, Copycat, I'm Hawk Moth. Once you get rid of Cat Noir, you can take his place, and Ladybug will be yours forever. The very thought of it makes me purr. Where is it? What are you looking at me for? I didn't eat it, I swear. How do you listen to messages...? [phone rings] Adrien's looking for his phone. What if he tracks it? He'll figure out I stole it and I'll spend my life in jail and I'll never get to go to the movies with Adrien. You need to get your priorities in order. I know. Some days it feels impossible to balance being Marinette and being Ladybug. Hey, this is Adrien's voicemail, leave a message. It must still be at the gym. Don't mind me. Just stealing this painting. Go about your business. [alarm rings] Hey! [groaning] I gotta get this on camera. And in some astonishing news, there's been a theft at the Louvre. Amateur videos show that the thief is none other than the famous hero, Cat Noir. This painting is the cat's meow. The "cat's meow"? Not only is he a fake, he's a terrible fake. Thanks JD. Now for your weather. Of course Adrien owns a super-expensive hi-tech smartphone. I can't even figure out how it works. It would help if you took off those silly mittens. And risk leaving finger prints? No way. [phone rings] Problem fixed? Almost. I haven't erased the message yet but I'm working on it now. No way. You palmed his phone? Yes... No... I mean... I was planning to give it back. Where are you? I could use some help. No can do. I'm waiting for details on the Cat Noir robbery. What? Somebody robbed Cat Noir? No, girl. Didn't you hear? Cat Noir came in and stole the Mona Lisa, in broad daylight. Ladybug's gonna turn up, and I don't wanna miss it. Chill. I'll be over later. OK. Cat Noir is a lot of things, but he's no thief. Time to transform. Tikki, Spots on! Easy, tigers, you've got the wrong cat. That thief's an impostor. I'm the real Cat Noir. Let me check it out. I have a knack for finding clues, you know, animal instincts. Of course. Come with me. Thanks for your help. Hey. I'm the real Cat Noir. I'm way slicker than that guy. Kitty's in the slammer, I repeat, kitty's in the slammer. Mr. Mayor, this is ridiculous. I'm sure there's a simple explanation. Kitty's in the slammer, Ladybug. Don't think you're gonna... Now, now, leave it to the experts. We've got it under control. Thanks for the hospitality but I gotta split. So, I'll say this one more time. You've got the wrong cat! Cat Noir's getting away. If he's so innocent, why is he running away? If you were wrongly imprisoned, wouldn't you? [police sirens] Requesting assistance. We're in pursuit of the suspect. Cat Noir, what's going on? You know I'm innocent, don't you, Bugaboo? Stop calling me Bugaboo. This is serious. I'm gonna find the culprit and save my tail. I'll get back to... [police sirens] Give yourself up, Cat Noir! Aren't you gonna go after him? I'll leave it to the experts. Come on, let's get him. [adrien whistles] If you want my opinion, I'd say the thief was akumatized. That I figured. See that lollypop stick? The sculptor. How did I not see that jealousy coming? Yours or his? [sarcastic laugh] So funny. Gotcha, Copycat. [bleeping] Cat Noir, where are you? I've found his den. -Who? -My copycat. I'm not getting you. If you'd been there this morning, you'd know. Well, tell me where you are. No. This is between me and him. I got myself into this mess, so I'm gonna get myself out of it. Cat? Cat! [bleeping] "Cat's in the bag!"? Cataclysm! I don't get what Ladybug sees in you, a fool who so easily falls into my trap. Looking for this? Which one shall I pick up? My one or my one. [bleeping] Ladybug, hurry, I've caught the imposter at Theo's workshop. I'll be there in 30 seconds. Don't come here, Ladybug, it's a trap! Too late, Cat, Ladybug's on her way, which was my plan all along. She won't be duped. She knows me too well. I know you well, too. And, from now on, she'll love me, not you! Love me? You're right. She loves me. That's why she'll be able to reveal your true identity. Copycat, stop the small talk and get me Cat Noir's Miraculous! [he groans] [whizzing] There you are. [Ladybug] Cat Noir, he really looks like you. That's because I am me. -Where's his Akuma? -Inside his ring of course. Grab it. Ladybug's doing all the work for us, what sweet irony. [bleeping] He even has the same powers as you. Simply amazing, isn't it? If you don't believe I'm Cat Noir, ask him about our love for each other. Have I ever lied to you, Bugagoo? I hope you didn't tell him about us. What? That we're... you know... We made a secret promise. Yes... Of course. We never made a promise, Copycat! I love you, Ladybug. I'm way better than this mangy alley cat! Sorry, liars are losers. Cat Noir may annoy me, but he's never lied to me. Thanks for the compliment... I think. Do it now, take his Miraculous! If I can't have you... then nobody will. Cataclysm! Let's wrap this up. Lucky Charm! A spoon? What am I supposed to do with this? Excellent job, Milady. Where's his Akuma? Photo in his pocket. Let's make it snappy. [cackling] You're going to change back before me. He's pretty good. Don't rub it in. I told you I was better than him. But I'm better than both of you. -Hey, it's me. -He's lying. I'm the real one. Now you're both annoying me. Show me your ring. How many pads do you have left? [bleeping] [bleeping] Cat Noir, scratch attack! Gladly. I love a good cat fight. Time to go Akuma fishing. No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma. Time to de-evilize! Gotcha. Bye-bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! Nice catch. I'm glad you could tell the real Cat from the fake. Once I figured out which cat really loved me, it was a no-brainer. Better help him out. His crush just got crushed. That makes two of us. What am I doing here? Ladybug? Sorry I couldn't make it this morning, Theo. Can you sign it for me? Of course I can. You've got some real artistry here. You really captured my essence. Thank you, Ladybug. And don't worry, I know about you and Cat Noir, it's OK. Didn't find it. To hear your message, press 1. To erase your message, press 2. Your message has been erased. I'm gonna tell him I found his phone. That'd be a good way to start a conversation, wouldn't it? Then I'll ask him out. That's my girl. [Nino] Maybe you dropped it. Then whoever has it found it in the locker room. [Alya whispers] Do it now. I had it during fencing practice. What in the...? I already looked in here. You need some time off. I know, let's go to the movies. Hey, dudes, mind if a few friends tag along? Sure thing! Yay!
