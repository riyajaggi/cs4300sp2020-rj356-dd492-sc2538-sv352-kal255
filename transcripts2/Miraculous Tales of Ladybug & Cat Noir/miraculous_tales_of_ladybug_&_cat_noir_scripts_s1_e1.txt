 Happy birthday! [she stumbles and groans] Happy birthday! Happy birthday, Adrien. Happy birthday, Adrien. Plagg, get that filthy camembert out of my face. Don't forget to clean your room after school. Mom, it's Friday. I'm already doing something with Alya. Fine. I'll clean it but don't blame me if I find your private stuff like e-mails, your diary... OK. I'll do it. Have a nice day, sweetie. Happy Birthday! I mean... Have a nice day.

 Your schedule, Adrien. Thanks, Nathalie. Did my father get back to you about my birthday party? Well... he... doesn't think it'd be a good idea. Of course not. Happy Birthday, Adrien. [Nino] Dude, seriously? Has your dad always been such a downer? Doesn't he remember what it's like to wanna party. No, I'm sure he was a downer back then, too. At least I tried. It's your b'day, dude... insist. You can do it. You can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I'm gonna have a chat with your pops. Don't waste your time, he won't change his mind. I can't do it. I can't do it. [Alya sighs] No you don't girl. You've been stalling all morning. Now's the time. [she squeals] [she giggles] Hey. Hey. Wait. Am I seeing what I think? Don't tell me it's Adrien's birthday. [Chloe groans] Do I have to do everything? Seriously, what are you good for? I... I wanted to gift you a make. I mean, gift you a give I made, I mean... Out of the way. Happy Birthday, Adrien. Yeah, thanks, Chloe. [Marinette moans] Did you get my gift? [hesitantly] No. What? Those delivery guys. I bet it was too heavy so they had to get another guy to help. Slackers. I'll make sure you get it by tonight. [she hums] [Nino chuckles] Get back there. Don't be a pushover... literally. [Marinette sighs] -What did you get him? -I didn't... you did. And it better be amazing and it better not be late! [Chloe groans] [Alya] Come on. You can do it. [car horn beeps] Gotta go... Photo shoot. Why can't I just mean what I say? Say what you mean? Exactly. Looks like I've got some business to take care of with Adrien's old man [struggling] This mailbox won't budge. Ring the bell. Are you kidding? What if Adrien answers? Yes? Hi... I'm in Adrien's class and I... [she mumbles] Did I already say that? Put it in the box. Thank you. I hope he likes it. You signed the note, right? Girl, girl, girl. Who was that? A friend of Adrien's delivering a gift for his birthday. Did you buy one from me? Oh... but... you didn't ask me to. Of course I did! Yes, Mr. Agreste. I'll take care of it. Good. [she sighs with relief] [intercom rings] Yes? [he hesitates] Hi... He'll be here in a minute. Adrien's not home yet. I was coming to see you, du... sir. Me? Yeah. I know you don't want Adrien to have a party, but it's his birthday, dude... I mean sir. It's all he wants. No, that's final. But that's messed up. He does well in class, he does what you tell him, photo shoots, fencing, Chinese, piano... Nino, you're here? Anything for my best bud. Show some awesomeness, dude... I mean sir, please. Forget it, Nino. It's fine. [father] Listen, young man, I decide what's best for my son. In fact, I've decided you're a bad influence and you're not welcome here. Leave now! Father, he was just trying to do something cool for me. Goodbye. Nino, wait. I'm sorry. My father he's... pretty stubborn. It's just best to stay out of his way. It's not fair, Adrien... harsh, uncool. Thanks anyway, Nino. [child sobs] But daddy, please. No, it's not playtime. You've chores to do. Adults ruin everything, all the time. Desperate to help his friend but feeling powerless. How frustrating... It won't be long before frustration turns to anger. Fly away, my little Akuma, and evilize him! Hawk Moth is my name, and Bubbler is now yours. I will help you with these horrid adults. All you have to do is get something from Ladybug and Cat Noir. [evil voice] Yes, Hawk Moth. [bubbling] [whooshing] [bubbling] No more adults means total freedom. This is soooo sweet! [fearful cries] Help! [screams] Perfect. Adrien must have gotten his gift by now? What did you say? I can't wait to get back to school. Mom! Mom! [screaming] Dad! Hawk Moth must have released another Akuma. I've gotta find his newest villain ASAP. Tikki, spots on! And now... party time! [Bubbler] Hey, hey, hey, Today's your lucky day, dudes. The adults are taking the day off. Make the most of it. No chores, no homework, no more nagging, just fun, fun, fun. This is the Bubbler's gift to you. Don't worry your parents will come back. I'll see to it. Take care of them in the meantime. Yeah! Go Ladybug! [clock ticks] [sarcastically] Wow, that was a birthday lunch-break to remember. Yay. Nathalie? Father? Yay! Happy birthday! Hey, birthday boy! Guess what? Daddy's gone. While the cat's away, the mice will play. Nino? The Bubbler's brought all your homies for one single sole purpose to ce... le... brate! [cheering] -Let's get dis party started! -Yeah! [dance music] Come on everybody! I've brought you here to party! So dance... or else you'll join the adults in the sky. [wicked laugh] It won't be long before Ladybug and Cat Noir show up to meet their doom. [wicked laugh] [Plagg] What's your problem? Relax. You're getting the party you always wanted. Nino's been akumatized. I've gotta help him You may never get this chance again. Come on. Let's have a little fun while your father's away. Then we'll save Nino, trap his Akuma, and all will be good. OK. You're right. This might be the first time that I get to do what I want for once. It's you and me, Bubbler. Yeah! Hey, nice party... I guess, since it's my first one. I'm requesting a slow-dance. It's a bit early, isn't it? [Chloe groans] It's for Adrien. His first slow dance... Oh, you know it, girl. [romantic music] Is it me, or does everyone seem a bit weird? Forget about them. Let's go dance. Come on. There's no way this is happening. Lucky charm! A record? [she cackles] [funky music] [gasps] [giggling] [cheering] Dude, who just hijacked my mix? Yours truly. [bleeping] [she gasps] Better bug out quick before I change back. Spots off. Marinette! It was an emergency. Yeah, if by emergency you mean jealousy. Once you use your lucky charm, you only have minutes before... I turn back, I know, but I figured... The Bubbler... he's not going anywhere. We've time to get some food to get your energy back. Then, we'll get right back out there. I promise. [dance music] Gotta find a place where I can transform fast. Where have you been, girl? I was scared for you. Me too. I'm sure Ladybug and Cat Noir will save us. They've never failed us. Come with me, I have something for you. I have to do something first. [tauntingly] It's about Adrien. [reluctantly] OK. Marinette, the Bubbler. OK, OK, in a sec. Look... Now you can sign your gift. Yes. Hey, you. Why aren't you having fun? None of your business. Then I'm gonna make it my business. [he cackles] "Love, Marinette" There. [she giggles] We're good. Spots on, Marinette. I can't do it now. Alya's here. [Ayla] What? Hey... Go ahead. I'll meet you in the yard. No! You were right, Tikki. I never should have waited. Hey, Paris! How ya doin'? [crowd groans] [cheering] [Adrien] Ladybug? Sorry, Bubbler, party's over. Why you gotta be like that? You made all the adults disappear, and now you're imprisoning anyone who isn't having fun. You will not bust up my party! I think I've been a complete idiot. Plagg, claws out! Looks like I made it just in time. I had it under control... but thanks. Get their Miraculouses. I want those powers... Now! [he roars] [bubbling] [she gasps] [he cackles] [Marinette whimpers] [he laughs wickedly] Give me your Miraculouses before you run out of air. Dream on, Bubbler. Total party-poopers, just like adults. Kids need adults! False. Kids need freedom, fun, let loose and live it up. [Bubbler] Adults are bossy. [Marinette] But adults keep children safe. They care for their kids. They love them. Most adults do anyhow. You must bring the adults back. Nope, never... Know what? Since you care about them so much, why don't you go float with them? [they scream] What do you think you're doing, Bubbler? You're supposed to seize their Miraculouses! Use your Cataclysm. Couldn't you have said that 500 feet ago? We can't stay stuck in this bubble together forever. Cataclysm! [she screams] -Shall we see if you land on your feet? -No thanks. Your stick... there! Got it! Hang on! [they yell] Good thing cats aren't afraid of heights. We have to get to his bubble sword. That's where the Akuma is. [bleeping] We'd better hurry. Where is everybody? Get out here and party. Sorry to burst your bubble. -Ladybug! -Ladybug! Ladybug! No one wants to party with you anymore, Bubbler. What's wrong with you all guys? Why you gotta be such haters? [he roars] No! Outer space is the next stop for your precious peeps. And they're never coming back! [bleeping] I'm gonna switch back soon. Hurry! Lucky charm! Your... plumbing skills gonna help us out? Your aim needs work. [Cat Noir] Is that all you got? Got it. [hissing] [Ladybug] Cat Noir, cover me. Go on! [he roars] [Ladybug] Get out of here, you nasty bug. No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma. Time to de-evilize! Gotcha. Bye-bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! Who? Dude... Pound it. You can't run forever, Ladybug. And when I catch you, I will crush you. I will destroy you both! Nathalie? Did my son like his gift? [nervously] Actually... I was going to check right away. Good. [sigh of relief] A birthday present... from your father. [happily surprised] Oh... thank you. I mean... please say thank you to my father for me. [Chloe] What do you mean '"Not for a week"? There were no adults to deliver it. So what? Ridiculous, utterly ridiculous. Serves Chloe right. [Adrien] Hey, girls. Hey, that's my scarf. He's wearing my scarf. Hey, dude. Yo, nice scarf, Adrien. Off the chain. Yeah. Can you believe it? My dad got it for me? It's so awesome. He's gotten me a lame pen for 3 years in a row. Wow. I guess anyone can change. Adults can be cool when you least expect it. Speaking of adults, my father said you were a bad influence but... Don't sweat it. We're buds, always n' forever. You've gotta tell him you knitted the scarf. But he seems so happy about his dad. I don't want to spoil it for him. [endearing sigh] Marinette... You're amazing, girl. You know that, right? And someday, Adrien will figure it out too... promise. [school bell rings]
