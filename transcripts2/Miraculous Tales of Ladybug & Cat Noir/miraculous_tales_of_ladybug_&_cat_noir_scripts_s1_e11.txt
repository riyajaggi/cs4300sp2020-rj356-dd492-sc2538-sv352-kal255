 After it devoured my family, my friends, even my beloved dog, Sniffles? Never! I won't run... I no longer fear it. I'm going to face it... [shrieking] Cut! Sorry, Mylene. Mylene, that's like the 10th take, and it's only the 1st scene. [Alix] 14th actually, but who's counting? I'm sorry. I'm gonna do better on the next take, I promise. [he sighs] [Rose] Anyone want tea? You're in the special forces. You don't get freaked out. I know but...

 that monster mask is so realistic and scary. Just big old me, Mylene. Nothing to be scared of. He doesn't even need a mask. What a bratty snob. Put the mask back on. You're playing a monster. Mylene, we need you to stay in character. I need to sing my happy song. It always makes me feel better. ♪ Smelly wolf, smelly wolf Stinky breath and slimy... ♪ And the Oscar for best pathetic scaredy-cat, afraid of its own shadow goes to [cackling] Mylene! [whimpering] Chloe, seriously? Yeah, so what? [sobbing] Mylene! Anyone going after her? Mylene, wait! [sobbing] Don't listen to them. It's easy to judge when they're not in front of the camera. You're awesome. Come back, I'll roar more quietly. Here, it's from my favourite band, The Zombie Skull Crushers. Wow. That's really sweet of you, Ivan, but they're right, I can't act to save my life. [sobbing] Excuse me. [sobbing continues] [evil voice] A film shoot... Oh yes. So many emotions, some fake, yet others very... very real. [whooshing] Fly away, my evil Akuma, and overpower this young, misunderstood artist. Epic, Chloe, just epic! What do we do without our lead actress? Who needs her? She was totally lame. [Ivan] You're lame! Mylene's crying her eyes out thanks to you. [Chloe] Me, lame? Hey, everyone chill out. You're right. [whispering] Chloe is lame. But fighting won't bring Mylene back. I'm the producer and I'll do all I can to finish filming tonight. The deadline for the Short Film Festival is tomorrow in precisely 26 hours, 15 minutes and... 13 seconds from now. Thank you, Max. We still have editing, post-sound,... Who's gonna take Mylene's part? Me, of course. You haven't read the script. Of course I have... The first scene anyway. It ends with a kiss between Agent Smith and Officer Jones. [she shrieks] You wrote that? Hold up. I didn't write that. I wrote it. It was just a little tweak to move the story forward. What? You edited my script without even telling me? That's low! [she growls] You mean our script. [he sighs] -Juice? -Thanks, Rose. Who cares who wrote what? We've got to film this thing right? She's right. We can only use the school until 6pm sharp which leaves us 9 hours, 12 minutes and 12 seconds, 11, 10, 9, 8... [Max counts down] Adrien and Chloe kissing cannot happen... No way! It makes no sense story-wise anyway. The main character's... Hold on. We can't just let Mylene leave. It's wrong. We all chose her to play the lead female role and we're all in this movie together. She needs our support. I'm gonna find her and bring her back. Always trying to save the day, aren't you, Marinette? Good luck finding the filthy hole that scaredy-cat's hiding in. [Marinette growls] Why are you so intimidated and scared all the time? [sobbing] [evil voice] Horrificator, I am Hawk Moth. Up until now, you have felt fear. From now on, you will cause fear. And after you've shown them how they make you feel, you'll do something for me in return. [evil voice] Yes, Hawk Moth. [bubbling] [Marinette] Mylene! Mylene? [she gasps] [she sighs] [Alya] Marinette! Did you find Mylene? No. You'd better come ASAP. There's some serious lip-puckering about to get going on. Time for you to use your scare tactics, Horrificator... and thrive! Horrificator, take 15. Action! I'm not scared of that Horrificator thingy, Officer Whatever-your-name-is. Now kiss me. Cut! Marinette, what gives? We're in the middle of a shoot and I'm the director, FYI. I say "cut," no-one else, comprende? And I'm the producer. Mylene's supposed to be the star. We're out of time. And for what I can see, Mylene is MIA. From the top. Here we go again. Agent Smith doesn't need a man in her life. Sniffles just got munched on. Do you wanna finish this film or not? Let's make Agent Smith a nurse instead. That'll fix everything. Sorry, but how exactly? I don't know but I'll look amazing in a uniform. We're not rewriting the script again! "Alya" is not going on those credits! [Chloe] Nobody cares! [Ayla] What? Everyone calm down. This movie's a team effort. Your nurse idea is perfect, Chloe. Of course it is because it's mine. But Chloe, you don't have a uniform. Which is why that idea was never believable. You should go to the nurse's office and try on some uniforms. [fingers click] Kim, Max, come! You've been promoted to wardrobe and bodyguard. Nice going, Miss Producer, now we have no lead again. Yeah, but now we've got rid of Chloe. And now what? We go find Mylene. She's here somewhere. I told you, tick-toc, there's no time. -We need a lead, now! -Marinette can do it. What? No! I can't act. I'm the producer. But you wanna kiss Adrien, don't you? [she sighs] Yes, but not like this. A nurse's uniform, how brilliant am I? Even that dimwit, Marinette, liked the idea. [swishing] I'm only doing this as a favour. When Mylene returns she'll have her role back. Of course she will, chill out. And just think, after tonight, you'll finally have kissed Adrien. [Marinette squeals] Hey, wait a minute. Marinette never likes my ideas, I think you've all been duped. You guys take care of the uniform just in case. -Did you hear something? -No, what? Totally unbelievable. What's that? I said... It's got to be believable. Don't worry. You'll do fine. Ready to roll? Camera... Horrificator, take 16. Action! I'm not scared of that monster, Officer Jones. Cut! I knew it. What did I say about people saying "cut"? Well played, Marinette. All that speech on working together, Then you stab me in the back! Your stupid movie won't get into the festival if I'm not in it because my daddy is one of the judges! [horrific screaming] Did you hear that? If this is one of your silly ploys to get rid of me you can forget it, besides... [horrific screaming] I definitely heard that. We'd better scope this out. A snack for the road? Hey! Anybody here? Kim? Max? Where are you? I saw the same pink goo in the bathroom. That's Kim's. They've vanished. Or they're playing a sick joke. We should tell Principle Damocles what's going on. Nino, come on, stop filming. No way. This is just getting good. Looks like it's time to bring in the alter ego. Yo, Adrien, where you going? I left Officer Jones's jacket. She'll probably wear it in all the scenes. [snarling] [splodging] Time to transform, Plagg. What are you doing? [he gasps] They'll think I've disappeared too. [Plagg] And you say I stink of camembert. Plagg, claws out! Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK [knocking] Mr Damocles? Sir? [gasping] [Rose] Even Principle Damocles is missing. Time to transform. Tikki, spots on! Anyone seen Agent Smith? I mean, Marinette. [gasping] Oh on. This is Marinette's phone. [grunting] Quick, check the windows. Crazy. We're trapped. I'm calling daddy. Dudes, phones never work in horror movies. -No bars. -No coverage. Told you so. Boo-ya! [gasping] Is everything OK? Ladybug in my movie, this is legit. And on my Ladyblog. We've got to evacuate the building, OK? No... That's easier said than done. Double legit! I tried to cut through it but it's totally indestructible. So we're trapped inside for now. Stay put and try to relax. Let's take a stroll. We know Hawk Moth's taken another victim in this school. There's one way to get rid of this goo and free everyone... capture that Akuma. Exactly, I love it when you read my mind. We'd better find this thing first and its prisoners. Wow, you did it again. Don't mind me. Finding missing peeps, solving a mystery, with Cat Noir and Ladybug! This movie's gonna be so swank. Stay together, right behind us. You too, Spielberg. [snarling] [whimpering] [he squeals] Absorb their fear, Horrificator, feed on it! It will give you strength. And soon enough, you'll be giving me strength too. We're better off on our own than with the others. Why stay with them when we can hide on our own? There! Anyone recognise that shoe? That's Adrien's shoe. That's weird, there's no pink slime. Yes, there is. [snarling] [screaming] Everybody, run! Awesome. So awesome. [she chuckles] [disgusted sigh] What's your name, Drool-ator? Cat's aren't afraid of slimy toads like you. We'd better find that Akuma. I see nothing but miles of slime. Help! Fear, it's fear that gives it its strength. [she screams] [fearful cries] [screaming] It's taken Nath' and Alix. The more people are scared of it the more powerful it gets. By defeating fear, we defeat it. First we've got to get out of this sticky situation before it dries. [she squeals] Did you see how it left Ivan alone? Yeah, what's that all about? I think the monster is Mylene. Where are Sabrina and Chloe? We'll find them... If we can find a way out. It's a good thing I come up with brilliant ideas. No-one's gonna get through that barricade. We can relax and let them do the hard work. [Sabrina yelps] [growling] [screaming] We're too late. But look, we can track the monster. [Nino giggles] Oh, yeah, I'm so amped! -Turn you amp down, will you? -My bad. Their fear will make you powerful enough to defeat Ladybug and Cat Noir. Get their Miraculouses! Anybody here? Ladybug, it's me, Chloe Bourgeois! Don't worry, we'll get you out. Well hurry up already! Is everyone here? [muffled] Yes! -Mr Damocles? -Present. -Alix? Nathaniel? -Yeah! Adrien? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. [relieved sigh] What about Marinette? Yeah, we've got everyone. They won't budge. Get us out! Calm down. We'll get you out. [growling] OK, now this is getting scary. Lucky Charm! Guitar strings, are you kidding me? Guitar, music... Mylene's song. That's it. Enough is enough. Cataclysm! [crashing] OK, we're all going to sing. Sing? So that's your plan. The only way is to get your fear under control. Do you all know Smelly Wolf? Seriously? Smelly Wolf? Care to join us? OK, everyone, 1, 2, 3, 4, ♪ Smelly wolf, smelly wolf ♪ ♪ Trapped in a stinky hut ♪ ♪ Smelly wolf, smelly wolf I'm gonna kick your... ♪ ♪ Smelly wolf, smelly wolf Stinky breath and slimey drool ♪ ♪ Smelly wolf, smelly wolf You're just a silly... ♪ [calm growl] Wow, it's working. [excited squeaks] [purring] That's the button I gave Mylene. That's where the Akuma is. No more evil-doing for you, Akuma. Time to de-evilise! Gotcha! Bye-bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! Pound it! [Nino] Awesome. You don't scare me, Ladybug! I'll destroy you in the end, someday, somehow... I'll destroy you! What do you think, Mr Mayor? Off the hook right? We didn't make the cut. He said the monster was a horrible replica, no joke! Don't worry, this is how all movie directors start. Yeah, even if that final kiss wasn't quite what we expected.
