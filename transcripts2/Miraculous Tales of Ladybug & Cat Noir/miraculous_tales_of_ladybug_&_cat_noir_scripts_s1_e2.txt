 It is Adrien's birthday and Marinette is struggling to give him the present she made for him. When Adrien's father won't allow Adrien to have a birthday party, his best friend Nino becomes angry about how unfair he's being towards Adrien.

 will be judged by the great fashion designer Gabriel Agreste, the father of our student Adrien. Adrien will model the winning design. And now, this year's theme: derby hats. Derby hats? [Marinette] Derby hat? Derby hat? Derby hat? I don't have any derby hat design. I've got top hats, caps, two-horned hats. A beret? I'm your girl. A sombrero? No problemo. But a derby? It won't even matter, I'll probably make a fool of myself, trip on my derby, collapse on Mr. Agreste, give him a concussion and Adrien will hate me.

 I'll never be a great fashion designer. My life is over! For a derby hat? Let me see your sketch pad. There must be something in here. Forget it, I'll probably mess everything up in the end. [Adrien] Wow, Alya! Awesome designs. I didn't know you had such skills. Thanks, but I can't take the credit. These sick designs belong to Marinette. Off the chain, right? You're super talented. You have a good chance of winning. Well... um... yeah, I like designs that... go upwards? [they gasp] While stopping? I mean... thanks? Sure. Good luck, maybe I'll be wearing your derby at father's next photo shoot. You gotta get a grip next time. Did you hear? He thinks you can win. Did you hear how impressed Adrien was? Of course I heard. Her? Win the contest? As if. Adrien will convince his father to award me the winner. I'm sure he will, Chloe. You're a born champion. Yours is sure to be the best. Yeah, it is. As soon as I can get my hands on this sketch pad. [Alya] Nine hours until show time. Yikes! I'm off to my secret garden of inspiration. [groaning] I'm okay, I'm okay. [yelling] The time has come for us to find our next victim, my wicked little Akumas, and to prey upon Ladybug and Cat Noir. Their Miraculouses must be mine. It's hard to be creative under pressure. You save the world under pressure. Designing a hat is a piece of cake. A cake derby hat, stylish and tasty. [pigeons coo] [cooing] [Mr. Ramier] Happy day, happy day. Splendid is the afternoon. Edgar, you fancy one. Fantastic. Dazzling performance. Scram, winged rats. How many times do you need to be told Mr. Ramier? No... feeding... the pigeons! It's forbidden. They'll leave their waste everywhere! Who's going to feed my poor pigeons? Mr. Ramier, you're banned from every park in Paris. Leave or I'll call the authorities. Wait, I'm the authorities. Get out! I almost feel sorry for that man. [Tikki] What a unique character. He was like a human bird. All he needed was a feather jacket to complete the look. A feather jacket? Nice thinking, Tikki. [Hawk Moth] Poor Mr. Ramier. The feeling of injustice. Such easy prey for my Akuma. Fly away, my little Akuma, and evilize him. Mr. Pigeon, I'm Hawk Moth. Neither this police officer nor any other park keeper should stop you from taking care of your friends. What would Paris be without pigeons? What would pigeons be without you? [evil laugh] [he yells] [mad cooing] Yes! -That's a derby. -Thanks, Tikki. We're so awesome! We? Sorry, you're so awesome. When are we... you going to make the hat? And ruin these nails? Of course not. Daddy will pay someone. Ouch! -What are you looking for? -A feather. I don't have a feather for the hat. It has to have one. Yes! Sorry, Mr. Officer, Sir. [flapping] [he yells] Come on, can't we go any faster? [Driver] Sorry, we have a situation. You need to get off. This is weird. [car horns] [Announcer] Pigeons took over Paris. This is a matter of major concern for authorities. I've just been told that a "Mr. Pigeon" is making an announcement. Oh dreary day for Parisians. [he coos] Sorry to ruffle your feathers, but Paris now belongs to pigeons. Flap-flap! [he coos] [Marinette] Paris needs us. Tikki, spots on! Yeah! [loud cooing] This is weirder than weird. Birds of a feather flock together. [he sneezes] I'm allergic to feathers. -That's helpful. -Tell me about it. [he begins to sneeze] There's another problem. The park keepers are vanishing. What? We have to track down Mr. Pigeon. But how? I don't know where we can find him but he can find us. [whistling] [humming] Act natural or he'll never show up. What? I am acting natural. [cooing] Ladybug and Cat Noir. Job well done, buddy-boy. Pigeons will reign supreme. Power to the pigeons! [triumphant cooing] Where is he? He should have been here by now. [flapping] [Adrien sneezes] What the... [he sneezes] [Cat Noir] Where's that bird brain Mr. Pigeon? He's gotta be here. If you want to give Paris to the pigeons for good, you must rid the city of those two pests. [cooing] I feel like birdseed all of a sudden. [they both gasp] Any bright ideas? You're the cat, don't you eat these things? Look. [Mr. Pigeon coos] Chirpy day! I'm so ruthless. [Hawk Moth] Excellent. Take their Miraculouses. Your Miraculouses. Give them to me or face the wrath of my feathered friends. [cooing] [banging] On the count of three, my pigeons will open fire. You can save your sorry skins by handing me your Miraculous. One, two... Cat Noir, the bars. Cataclysm! [creaking] [he gasps] [Cat Noir] Well, well, the pigeon is a chicken. Me? I'm not flying away. I'm just killing two birds with one stone. [he coos] [flapping and yelling] [they gasp] [mocking yell] [mocking cooing] Merry Christmas! I'm not done with you yet. [mad cooing] [beeping] I've got to go before my identity is revealed. You wouldn't want to let the cat out the bag. Ha, ha, very funny. Ladybug, Cat Noir, I'm in great danger of losing money if my guests leave Paris. Get rid of those pigeons. Before we do, I have an urgent need. An urgent need? I see. Head to the Royal Suite. There's paper in there. Perhaps you'd prefer a litter tray? No need for litter. But could I have some camembert? Sorry, emergency. [knocking] -How do you like your camembert? -Runny. [knocking] -Unpasteurized Saint-Claquos. -Thanks. [beeping] [Plagg screams] The exhaustion. My poor aching body. I can't move a muscle. [Adrien] You wanna bet? [gasping] My gooeyness... Eat up, Ladybug needs help. I can get a much better view from up here. They're flying in the same direction. Better follow them. [Elevator beeps] -Ready when you are. -Let's go. That's where Mr. Pigeon keeps the park keepers. The Grand Palais. [he begins to sneeze] My pigeon radar is on alert. Either your radar's on the brink or the park keepers are unattended. Let's set the cat among the pigeons. Hold up, kitty. It's too easy. I've got a plan. [Mr. Pigeon] Perfect timing. We're ready to greet them. They're going to fall right into my trap. It won't be long before you get your Miraculouses. I can't wait, my dear Pigeon. [Ladybug] If we destroy that bird call, we'll capture the Akuma. You open the window, I grab him and you snag the bird call. Early bird gets the worm. [he sneezes loudly] [tinkling] So much for the element of surprise. [yelling] [cooing] [yelling and cooing] Diddle-dee-dee, come closer. I have a bone to "peck" with you. I'd be honored. [yelling] [Agent] Get us out of here. [evil giggle] Lucky charm! A coin? What am I supposed to do with that? [tinkling] You can't buy yourself out of here. Cat Noir! [Ladybug] Snack time, pigeons. [yelling] My bird call. No! Cat Noir, grab it. [he sneezes] [crashing] -Yes. -Ouch. [desperate cooing] No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma. Time to de-evilize. Gotcha! Bye-bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! [twinkling] [whooshing] What happened? Where am I? Pound it. Wretched pigeons, wretched Ladybug! I'll destroy every one of you. [he roars] I have less than an hour. [busy signal rings] Where is that girl? Hello, Mr. Damocles, I am Mr. Agreste's assistant. Hello Miss. Pardon me, but where is Mr. Agreste? I'm here. Ah... Hello Mr. Agreste, welcome to our school. Adrien, take Nathalie around. There's Mr. Agreste. He's coming this way. They have poured their hearts and souls into their projects. Where have you been? You got your hat? Yep, here. [she gasps] -What? -But it's the same as Chloe's. What? Hi, Mr. Agreste, I'm Chloe Bourgeois. You know my father, the Mayor. That thieving little brat! -Shall I take care of it? -I think I can handle this. Turn the tablet to Miss Bourgeois's hat. Is this a joke? No fair! Marinette copied my design. It's scandalous! [sobbing] I apologize for the situation. But I can prove that this derby hat is mine. Go ahead. Everything is handmade from the embroidery to the weaving and the stitching. Done by myself. And there's an element that only a true designer knows about. I signed mine. [Chloe cries] Exquisite creation. You have the laboring hands of a hat maker, Miss... Marinette. Congratulations, Miss Marinette. You're the winner. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Adrien will wear your derby. Awesome job, Marinette. [he starts to sneeze] [he sneezes loudly] [sniffing] I'm allergic to feathers. [he sneezes] Gesundheit. [he sneezes] Thanks. [cheering] [giggling]
