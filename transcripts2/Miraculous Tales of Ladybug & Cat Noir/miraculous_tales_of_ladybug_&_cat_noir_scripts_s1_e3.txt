 Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir (2015–…): Season 1, Episode 3 - Copycat - full transcript 
 After she attempts to ask Adrien out to the movies over the phone, Marinette accidentally leaves behind an embarrassing voice mail and rushes out to delete it before he listens to it. Meanwhile, an artist named Theo is releasing a statue in honor of Ladybug and Cat Noir. He happens to be in love with Ladybug and is excited to see her at the unveiling event, but only Cat Noir ends up coming. After the event, Cat Noir insinuates to Theo that he and Ladybug are in 'that' kind of relationship, leaving Theo envious. Sensing his envy towards Cat Noir, Hawk Moth influences Theo and turns him into 'Copy Cat', an exact replica of Cat Noir.

 Manon, please. It's not finished. You're going to ruin it. [Manon giggles] [she groans] [giggling] I'm voting for Mireille. She's the best. Hey, my phone. [Manon giggles] [frustrated groan] Why did I agree to do this again? [Tikki squeaks] Stay low, Tikki. Don't worry. If you can handle Manon for a day, any villain here on out will be a piece of cake. [doorbell rings] -[Marinette] Alya? -Hey, I got a huge scoop. Guess who's on a photo shoot in the park? Now? Adrien is in the park right now? As we speak. Oh gosh. What... What am I going to say to him? The same thing as usual... -I... I.... Wh... -Stop it. Who's she? I forgot about this little detail. And who's she? Manon, my mom's friend's daughter. I'm babysitting all day. [she gasps] Oh no, I can't go out. Let me guess, another you-couldn't-say-no favor? No... I just couldn't... say... no. Look, no problem. I'll look after your little detail. [Manon giggles] Thanks, but I'm responsible for her. Besides, I couldn't do that to you, she's... an absolute angel. [crashing] [Manon giggles] Manon, put that down! [she groans] Come back. [squealing] [crashing and giggling] [crashing and giggling continues] You're a pushover, Marinette. I babysit my sisters all the time, which makes me an expert in dealing with "angels". Who are you anyway? I'm a mythical unicorn from the world of Reespa, disguised as a totally fabulous human girl. I grant magical wishes but only to little monkeys who behave. [she giggles] No you're not... are you? [they both giggle] [Marinette gasps] OK, let's all go to the park. [Manon] Yay. [cheerfully] OK. This is the moment we've been waiting for! The viewers have made their decision. And the new Kidz Plus Weathergirl is... Mireille! [cheers and applause] She crushed you. Better luck next time. [she groans] What's the big deal? You only lost by half a million votes. [evil voice] The vibrations are so strong... I can feel the imminent anger and sadness... the moment of weakness of my next victim, such easy prey for my Akuma. [angry sighs] [elevator beeps] [sobbing] [angrily] I should have won. I had the talent, the star looks, everything! But she took everything away from me. They took everything away from me! [fizzing] [she squeals] [evil voice] So correct you are. You should have won, yes. [angrily] I should have won, yes! Stormy Weather, I am Hawk Moth. I give you the power to seek revenge on them as my Weathergirl. All you have to do is bring me the Miraculous. Can you do that? Yes. That's my Weathergirl. Show the world who the best Weathergirl really is. [camera clicks] Come on. We'll stroll over there, real cool, as if we just happened to be passing by. -Then what? -Then... I'll invite him for a smoothie after the shoot. Then, we'll get married and live in a beautiful house, have kids, a dog, maybe a cat... No, forget the cat. A hamster, I love hamsters. [she giggles] Let's start with "passing by" and see if we can get to that smoothie. [she giggles] Magnifico, super. I want to see hunger in your eyes. [Marinette] Remember... cool, just be cool. [Alya] We couldn't be more invisible. OK, let's start over. [Marinette gasps and giggles] [photographer chuckles] Did you see that? He waved at me. Yeah, I saw it too. Pretty normal since we're in the same class. [Marinette giggles nervously] [elevator beeps] [elevator beeps] [wicked laughing] I am Stormy Weather, the only Weathergirl who always gets the forecast right. And, unfortunately for you, there's a freak icy front moving in, right now! [zapping] Somebody get me out of here! Help! Help! [photographer] Bravo, that's it. Gimme ze smile of when mamma brings spaghetti. OK, now... Oh no, mamma dropped ze spaghetti. Now, eat ze spaghetti off ze floor. Yes, you're angry. [photographer] Show me angry... Yes, yes. Marinette, I want a balloon with Mireille on it. Can I? Can I? Marinette? Marinette! [he groans] Silenzio! Come on. Come on, I'll get you that balloon. No, I wanna go with Marinette. I'll deal with it. I am her babysitter. But what about Adrien? [crowd cheers] Mireille, Mireille! [she cackles] Where's Mireille? [frustrated groan] For all of you who voted for Mireille, I'd advise you to move indoors. It's going to get very blustery. Oh wait... too late. [blustering wind] [crowd gasps and screams] Come on. Let's go back. I wanna go on the merry-go-round. No, no, not right now. I've gotta get back to Adrien. You promised. You aren't going to break your promise, are you? Oh please, not the baby-doll eyes. You know I can't say no to... [caring sigh] [Manon giggles] [angry groan] [child sobs] Here's a new one. [camera clicks] No, no. Ze boy haz eaten too much spaghetti. We needz more energy... more romance. We needz... a girl. You, I need an extra. Who? Me? Si, to pose wiz Mr. Adrien. You don't want me. I... I'm having an allergic reaction to this apple. [speaking with a lisp] I know jutht the perthon. [puffing and panting] They need an extra to pose with Adrien. What? Seriously? Is that boy your boyfriend? What? No... I mean, yes... No. Go on. What're you waiting for? But what about Manon? You take care of Prince Charming, I'll take care of Miss Unicorn. You don't know how to control her anyway. No way! Marinette's my babysitter. Trust me. Unicorns unite. Let's go to Reespa and find some sad village kids and grant them those wishes. Yee-haw! Yee-haw! [Manon giggles] [screaming] Run! Time to transform. Tikki, spots on! Yeah! [crowd screams] [explosions] Help! [he gasps] [explosions] Plagg? Plagg! I'm not here. I'm sleeping. [excited cry] [he sighs] For your information, I can smell camembert in my sleep. It's one of my many talents. Great, but there's no time to talk cheese. Plagg, claws out! Why did I leave Manon? I should have never done that. No, Alya's right. She's in good hands. I must trust her. I'll get you out of here! Let's wire-cut this icy cake. [she groans] Or not... On to plan B. Don't worry. It will be OK. Where's Marinette? She hasn't forgotten you, Manon. How did you know my name? I... I... Marinette told me. She's coming right back, OK? [Ladybug chuckles] [explosions] Hey, Ice Queen. What's with all the terrorizing? Why don't you pick on someone your own temperature? My name is not Ice Queen, it's Stormy Weather! Listen, I'm feline more generous than usual, today. So cool down, and we'll call it quits. 'K? [blustering wind] [Cat Noir yells] [groaning] I thought cats always landed on their feet. Why thanks, M'Ladybug, but I had it covered. [she gasps] No time for your childish charm, Cat Noir, but you're welcome. We should be expecting lightning storms, like, right now! [zapping] [thunder rumbles] [they scream] [exploding] [they groan] [they gasp] You've just won yourself a catfight. Black Ice! [car alarms bleep] [she screams] Gotcha! [she gasps] [she groans] [blustering wind continues] [car alarms bleep] [car alarms bleep] [crashing] [zapping] [explosion] A little Cat Noir will take the wind out of her sails. [he groans] Wow, kitty-kitty, think before you leap. -You've got a plan? -Just follow my lead. Not you again. [blustering wind] [they scream] [screaming] [they groan] [crashing] [panting] [bus bell rings] [crashing] [bus bell dies out] [he groans] [she giggles] [Alya sings] Lemonade crunchy ice, hit it once, hit it twice. Freeze! Hey, no fair. You always win... [ice cracks] What was that? It's... It's the big Goblin King. He ate too much and split his shirt. [she roars] [giggling] [rumbling] Wanna hear a story? You've shown them all who the real winner is, my Weathergirl, but now is the time for you to fulfil your part of the agreement, and here's my plan. Maybe she's got anger issues. Or she failed her driving test. Hello, viewers. Here's the latest forecast for this first day of summer. Looks like Mother Nature had a change in plans. Summer vacation is officially over. Already? But I look so good in a swimsuit. The cat suit will do, thanks. At least now we know where to find her. Prepare for the worst weather ever with 10 ft. snowdrifts. Hey. That girl reminds me of someone. It's her. The Akuma must be in her parasol. In Stormy Weather's world, it's Winter Wonderland, forever! [they roar] It's a recording. [cackling] [zapping] [they gasp] This is all going wonderfully according to plan. Soon their Miraculous will be mine. [Hawk Moth] Bring them to me! [cackling] [Cat Noir] Frosty the Snowgirl's getting away. Do I hear a damsel in distress? [Ladybug] Some of us don't have night vision. No need to bug out. Just trust me. Then the cyclops monster picked the princess up and said, "Look into my eye." [Manon giggles] Then she stuck a finger right in it. As soon as she took a bite of the cursed potato, the poor princess fell into a deep, deep sleep. [creaking] [they gasp] [fearfully] Hurry up, Ladybug. [Ladybug] OK, I think I can manage to... [Cat Noir] Duck! [Ladybug] I'll follow your lead on this one [cackling] You airheads, you fell right into my trap. The time is now. Bring me the Miraculous! There's no way out! Party's over, fools. We're just... [he chuckles] We're just getting started, Stormy. Lucky charm! A bath towel? What do I do with this? Great. We're about to be obliterated but... at least we'll be dry. Just hold your whiskers. Hey! So what's the plan? My arm's starting to get cramp. See that sign? Check it out. Alright! Cataclysm! Hey, Coldilocks, is that all you've got? [she squeals] Get out of here, you nasty bug. No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma. Time to de-evilize! Gotcha. Bye-bye, little butterfly. Miraculous, Ladybug! [sparkling] [whooshing] [sparkling] [hissing] And after defeating the three-headed dragon... with taekwondo... the princess kissed her Prince Charming and... They lived happily ever after? [hesitantly] Sure... until they had little monkeys like you who drove them crazy. [Manon chuckles] [she gasps] What am I doing up here? [together] Pound it. Someday, your Miraculous will be all mine. I don't care how many enemies I need to throw at you to win, but I will be victorious! [panting] Hey, there's the photographer and Adrien waiting for you. It's not too late? Come on, Marinette, you saved Manon and the whole world for that matter. Have some fun. [Manon] Marinette! [giggling] I know what your secret is. Wh... What secret? Ladybug is your best friend. That's how you always know what the other one's gonna do. [relieved sigh] Can I have a lollipop? Can I? -Can I? Can I? -No, Manon. I've something to do. Alya, you'll watch her, yeah? I'm ready for the photo shoot. Wait. Who iz zat... angel? [photographer giggles] Angel... magnifico. [Marinette sighs] [photographer giggles]
