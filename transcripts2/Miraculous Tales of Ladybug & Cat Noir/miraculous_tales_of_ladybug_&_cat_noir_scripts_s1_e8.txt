 Go to the principal's office and show him that chicken scratch! Then you'll be really sorry. [gasps] [Marinette gasps] Look Sabrina, it's him as a superhero. Look who he's saving, It's Marinette. He's totally crushing on you, Marinette. Give me that. Enough, Nathaniel, go! [evil voice] Artists can be so emotional. I love it. [whooshing] Fly to him, my little Akuma. Draw him into our evil web. [whooshing] Are you tired of having your creative spirit crushed? Evillustrator, I'm your friend and patron of the arts. I'm here to offer you support but I don't give this power for free. I've some items that need retrieving. Just tell me what you want. [bubbling] The next particle physics presentation group is Nino, Adrien, and Alya. [enviously] So lucky. And Sabrina, Chloe, and Marinette. [gasping] So unlucky. Can't you add her to another group? We work better on our own. This is a group presentation, not pairs. Deal with it. [bell rings] I hate dealing with it. Could we trade groups? And deal with that twosome of terror? Sorry. But I promise to talk all about you. You're the best! [Chloe] Forget it, Sabrina. I've no time for dumb projects. Besides, now you have Marinette to help you. OK, that's fine. We'll do the work. Don't worry. [Marinette] What? Is everything OK? It's fine, Marinette. Why can't you help with the project? None of your business, nosey. Actually, since I'm part of this group, it is. It's OK. You and I will do all the research and the writing then Chloe can present it. That way it's equal. That's not equal at all. Is that how you two work? Yeah, ever since grade school when I started doing Chloe's homework. We've been BFFs ever since. You got a problem with that? Come on, Sabrina. Sabrina, Chloe's taking advantage of you. You don't have to do what she says. That's not how a best friend acts. [Chloe] Not only am I Sabrina's best friend, I'm her only friend. So she better do what I say, cuz without me, she has nothing. I'd rather have no friends than be friends with you. Whatever. I've more important things to do. My hair's a mess and Jean-Claude promised to work his magic. Later. [panting] Marinette! I can't believe you stood up to Chloe. It was so amazing. Well... yeah... What are friends for? I'm super excited to hang out with you and have a new friend who helps with the project We'll have the best time together. We'll do the presentation and tell the truth about Chloe, OK? [uncertainly] Sounds... great. Yay! I'll see you in the library, bestie. [Chloe huffs] What do you mean you're not doing it? Marinette's right. I-I'm not your slave. I never actually said that. But Marinette didn't buy a super cute beret. And I did. Perhaps I could lend it to you. Are you trying to bribe her into staying your friend... with a hat? [excitedly] A really, really adorable hat. That would look fantastic on me. No, excuse me, but you are trying to steal my friend from me with homework! [screaming] My hair! [violent blowing] [screaming] [violent blowing] Plagg, claws out! [Chloe] No, not the hair! Time to transform. Tikki, spots on! [frightened screaming] No! Stop! Run and hide! [Ladybug squeals] I got wind you were being blown away by a hairy situation. Fewer puns, more action! [Ladybug yells] That guy looks pretty sketchy. [they groan] Where did he go? I don't know but he sure illustrates his point. [Cat Noir] Chloe, this Evillustrator, he's targeting you specifically. Any idea why? No, everyone adores me. Yeah, because you're so adorable. Yay! Ladybug said I'm adorable. I totally need a picture of us together. [Ladybug huffs] That was unpleasant. I look great, but your smile's wonky. Let's take another. [Ladybug groans] Sorry, I'm a little camera shy. - Someone's got a fan. - Yeah, great. What's the deal? Why are you acting weird? You gotta admit that having her worship you is awesome. [groaning] Seriously? I'm over this. Let's go. Are you kidding? What if he attacks her again? Fine, you stay. Later. What do you mean, later? You want to protect her, so you don't need me. So... later! [Chloe] Ladybug, text me, OK? [cry of pain] Hey! Sorry, Tikki, Chloe just fires up this little red bug. Well, simmer down. A hot head won't get you anywhere. It's hard to keep my cool... especially in school. Oh my gosh, Sabrina, the project! Look like you have a new BFF. [she groans] [footsteps] [worried cry] [Marinette gasps] It's you... from the library. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. [confused] OK. But why did you attack Chloe? Chloe is cruel and selfish. Can't argue with that. [nervously] Are you... going to hurt me? You? You're Marinette. You're beautiful, sweet and perfect. I could never hurt you. [embarrassed] Wow, that's very... flattering... Thank you. [nervously] I just came to ask... It's my birthday today and... would you wanna come to my party? Oh... actually... it's not really the best night. I've got a presentation to work on and I have to call my friend so we can meet and... Please. It'll just be you and I. [romantic music] Oh, my gosh. [awkwardly] That's...me You like it? [hesitantly] I love it. So much that I'll be at your party... on one condition. Anything for you. You can't hurt Chloe anymore. I can't bear violence. For you, and only you. Meet you next to Notre-Dame at sunset. [whooshing] [she sighs] What are you thinking, Marinette? I'm thinking poor Nathaniel has a crush on me, and his alter ego, the Evillustrator, is gonna get crushed by Ladybug. But how is Ladybug going to crush this crush when you're going on the date with him as Marinette? Maybe some cool cat needs to crash the party. [Chloe whines] Sabrina is so selfish making me do this project myself. [whining] My brain hurts. [she gasps] Hey... Cat Noir, are you any good at particle physics? This cat's got particle physics in the bag. Great. Sit, kitty. Now, make it sounds purr-fect for my presentation. [she gasps] See that? I made a cat joke. I can be funny. [sarcastically] Yeah... hilarious. [phone rings] You can't just fly off and then make cat calls, Ladybug. Sorry, that wasn't cool, but you can leave Chloe. I need you to protect this girl. Her name's Marinette. Cute, isn't she? The Evillustrator is in love with her. He won't harm Chloe if Marinette comes to his party. While he's distracted, you take him down. What about you? I'm going on a secret mission. I'll catch you later. Can you handle it? [he chuckles] It'll be a cinch. You're out of danger. So, see ya... Later. [angrily] Later? What about my presentation? [she growls] [gasping] Sabrina... you scared me. Sorry, I was just waiting for you. Did you get my messages? Yes... Yes I did. And I was totally going to call you. You were? [excitedly] I knew you would... Eventually. So I did your geography homework. [surprised] You didn't have to. Since you're my new best friend, it's the least I can do. Thanks but I can't accept it. Really? [she sighs] OK, but just this once. Great. So, you wanna work on the project tonight? I'm so sorry Sabrina. I've something really important to do. Something important, really? That's fascinating. You know who else uses that excuse? [hesitating] No... Chloe. I'm beginning to see how similar you two are. You expect me to do all the work, like she did. Right? No...I-I don't, really. It's just... I can't believe I did your geography homework for you. [she sighs] I thought I was going to have to save you from her claws. Get it? Claws. I haven't even introduced myself. I'm Cat Noir. Yeah, I know. You save the day all the time and stuff. I'm Marinette. Why are you here? That birthday-boy date of yours is bad news. [she mimics him] But you're safe with me. That puts my mind at ease. But I am going to need help. Care to assist a superhero? What about Ladybug? Aren't you a duo? She's busy. [she mimics him] So you get to be my Ladybug. [sigh of repulsion] Cat Noir and I fighting crime together? Amazing. What do I do? Just get his pencil away from him. I'll take care of the rest. [she giggles] [bleeping] What a lovely little scene you're setting, but I don't get distracted, boy. I just want Marinette to love me. [angrily] And I want the Miraculous. So get it! Or else... [throbbing] [fearfully] OK, I will, I will. [Marinette] Happy birthday. [she giggles] [shyly] Marinette. Thanks for accepting to come. - It's so beautiful. - You like it? Well hold on. I'm just getting started. [he groans] Come on, you've gotta be kidding. Sorry... I didn't mean to startle you. I can't draw in the dark. Voilà! You're so talented. So why would you want to use your power to hurt people. Not all people, just Chloe. And I won't do it again. You were true to your promise so I'll be true to mine. I actually draw a little too. I'm not as good as you, of course. I'm sure you're great. Can I draw you something special for your birthday? [surprised] That would be amazing. [he gasps] Marinette, give my pencil back. I need to draw something... now. No... I'm keeping it. Cat Noir, now! Marinette? You're working with him? I'm so stupid. I thought you liked me but you're just like Chloe. Teasing me, mocking me, leading me on! Come on, seriously? Why is everyone comparing me to Chloe? And I'm taking back my promise. Chloe's going to get a lesson she'll never forget. We've been penned in, literally. [Marinette gasps] Cat Noir, put your stick like this, then extend it. - Great thinking. - Yeah, I'm a genius. Gotta go. A superhero's work is never done. Damsels in distress, ladies in waiting... I've more saving to do. You can thank me later. Me thank him? He should be thanking me. We'd still be trapped if it wasn't for me. [Tikki] Speaking of which... He needs help saving Chloe. [sobbing] I'm so sorry, Miss, but after what happened in the Library, I couldn't work on my project. It would have been too traumatic. Just look what it's done to my hair. [sobbing suddenly stops] Who's going to believe that? Even a stupid hairdryer couldn't make me look bad. [door rumbles] Cat Noir, is that you? [she gasps] [she screams] Chloe, where are you? Are you hiding? That is so cute. You're playing hide and seek. In the closet? [bleeping] [she screams] [he chuckles] [she screams] I win, Chloe. I found you. My designer dresses, my heels... You're a monster! You like to walk all over people but you don't like it when others trample on you, do you, Chloe? Do you? [she screams] Oops, broke your heel, better watch your ankles. Look what the cat dragged in. No cat dragged me anywhere, Cat Noir. I flew in all on my own. What was the secret mission? If I told you, it wouldn't be a secret. This is what's known as the final showdown. The thing is if you knew her, you wouldn't bother saving her. She's the real baddie! It's not true. Everybody adores me. Look out! [she whimpers] The light... - He can't draw in the dark. - Got it. Cataclysm! [crumbling] Here, kitty, a ball and chain to play with. Hey! Sadly, those who get in my way get erased. [he yells] [she gasps] [she whimpers] [ring bleeps] No, no, no...! [Hawk Moth] Cat Noir's Miraculous, take it, take it now! Before you go, you have something I want. Ladybug, this cat doesn't have 9 lives. Lucky charm! [whooshing] A bouncy ball? Just try and stop me with that, little lady. [she sighs] [tinkling] Gladly. [bouncing and smashing] [he yells] [whimpering] Hurry! No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma. Time to de-evilise! Gotcha! Bye-bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! [whooshing] [bubbling] [he gasps] Where am I? POUND IT! [angrily] No! Their Miraculouses were practically mine, and they will be! Once I have them all in my grasp, I will have absolute power! [Ayla] What happened when Ladybug and Cat Noir turned up? To be honest, they only made matters worse. They came barrelling in and started smashing things, throwing balls around. Balls? [she giggles] I hope you had a good time taking care of that thing... I'm really sorry, Sabrina, but I can meet you today to work on the project. Too late. Chloe and I are doing the project together. You mean you're doing it. Of course, after all she's been through. [Marinette groans] Nice new beret. I know. Chloe lent it to me. She really is my BFF. Chloe! Your geography homework's ready. [she sighs] Hey, I heard about your adventures with Cat Noir. - Were you scared? - Me, scared? It was a dream... I mean you're a dream... I mean in your dreams. [sighing] This is a nightmare. [uncertainly] OK... So what about Cat Noir, was he awesome? Sure, yeah, but not as awesome as you, because you're the most awesome of awesome. So... that's a yes? [bell rings] Do you realise you just blabbered on to Adrien about how you think he's awesome? He touched me. I'll never wash my jacket again. Girl, you have got to get better control of your emotions.
