 Some of you have stepped up. I do appreciate it. Let's move on to the next assignment. Is Marinette still in the girls' room? I don't know, Miss. [bell rings] I want you to read chapter three of "France: The First Thousand Years". Then answer this simple questionnaire. See to it that Marinette receives it. It's Marinette, leave a message. Marinette? Have you seen Marinette? No. [humming]

 [gasping] [whispering] Chloe's Ladybug? Marinette, ring me ASAP. We gotta talk. - Nino, wait! - Yeah? Come, I need your help. - So... - Shhh. It's Marinette. Leave a message. [she sighs] I hate when she goes AWOL. Where is that girl? Adrien's the exact same way. You get sly when Mr. Control-Freak is your Daddy-o. [phone rings] [TV announcer] Once again Ladybug and Cat Noir have saved Paris. I think I've just sniffed out who the real Ladybug is! [Nino sighs] Chloe. [laughing] Chloe? Seriously? She's too self-absorbed to save the world. You are cray-cray, Lady. [Alya] I am so not, you'll see. Time flies when you're saving the world. Day's already over. I missed an entire half a day of school and of seeing Adrien! Whoever is behind all this is keeping us on our toes. [she giggles] You don't have any toes. Alya brought back your schoolbag. - Hey, mom. - You seem so forgetful these days. You need some extra exercise for that growing brain of yours. Good idea, mom. I'll start tomorrow. Ladybug saved Paris from destruction, but who's gonna save me from my homework? What's this? "Call me, I know who the real ladybug is." No way. You think she knows? I doubt it. Alya always jumps to conclusions too fast. [Tikki] But just in case. No worries. I got it covered. [beeping] Dang. No signal. Sorry, Miss. Cell tower maintenance. No signal for the next hour. Try again later. Let's finish your homework. [she sighs] Hey there. Hi. You look totally fab. No, not you. It's still a month from Halloween. If she's a superhero, then I'm the Wizard of Oz. I'm telling you she's Ladybug. Can you prove it? What time is it? School starts in... An hour ago! Don't mess up your lines. [he groans and giggles] [he stutters] Ladybug! Look over there. [questioning sigh] What kind of lame joke is this? Wh-What I meant was... did you see Ladybug yesterday? Isn't she amazing? I wonder who she really is. Up too late DJing, Nino? Obviously, you didn't get your beauty sleep. [camera click] Chloe! Alya's looking in your locker. That's a lie, I so was not. Give it back! [he giggles] Who's the little liar now? She's guilty of invasion of privacy. I have proof! What? All I did was take a measly photo. I'm sorry, there's no policy on invasion of privacy. Then breaking and entering. I didn't break into her locker. It was open. Nothing was stolen? Only my very soul. My locker is my secret garden. He who enters uninvited burglarizes my inner being. [sobbing] Right. An hour of detention, Alya. Are my ears failing me? One miserable hour of detention to a heinous criminal? Sabrina. The rules state that any student guilty of theft shall be suspended one week. Yes, but she hardly stole... I'm not sure that my father would agree. [principal] Well... now let's not bother your father, the Honorable Mayor, with a minor locker situation. [he hesitates] What I mean is... [clearing his throat] You're suspended for a week. That is so unfair, I'm gonna protest this on the school blog. [Chloe hums] The school blog is suspended as well. [angrily] She's no superhero! She's super-psycho! [evil voice] School life... Such a science experiment. A Petri dish of cultivating secrets, lies and betrayal. A thriving vivarium for my evil little Akumas. [whooshing] Fly way, my little Akuma and evilize her. I'm late, I'm so, so late. [Marinette pants] [Alya pants] [Alya sighs] It's Marinette, leave a message. [whooshing] [Hawk Moth] Lady Wifi, I heard that you're seeking to unmask Ladybug. I'd like to help you if you help me, too. I'll expose the lies of anyone who covers up the truth. Sign me up. -Where is she? -She's been suspended. What! Marinette, would you come late discreetly? Sorry... What happened? Accused of breaking into Chloe's locker... I mean Ladybug's locker. What! Marinette, go to the principal's office! [she sighs] What are you talking about? Alya says Chloe is Ladybug, bro. She is crazy. [tinkle] Mr. Damocles? Sir? [she gasps] [stuttering] [fizzing] I'm Lady Wifi, Revealer of the Truth. Your principal would like to share a tidbit with you. So, Mr. Damocles, is it true you wrongly suspended a student named Alya? Yes, it is. So you were biased, unfair, totally unjust? Yes, I was. Oh no, Alya. Time to transform. You're going to fight your best friend. No, I'm gonna save my best friend. Tikki, spots on! Yeah! [lively music] Now, I'll be taking you to meet the girl who's been hiding behind the Ladybug mask. [Damocles yells] Stay connected. [Mrs. Bustier] Everyone go directly home, now. Don't forget to read chapters 4 and 5. If Chloe is Ladybug, Lady Wifi is gonna head for her house. It also means you have a crush on Chloe. [Plagg giggles] Plagg, claws out! [lively music] [bleeping] [Chloe yells] What? This can't be. [Ladybug] Who's being sneaky now? Oh, Ladybug... but... You don't actually believe she's the real Ladybug. Yeah, of course not. Who would believe she's the original Ladybug? She's just a diehard fan. A copy... cat. Right. [phone rings] [panting] Hello? [she yells] Well, hello there, Ladybug. [Chloe yells] We've got Wifi. Well, well, so my hunch was correcto-mundo. Everyone thinks Ladybug masks a little angel. Think again, people. [Lady Wifi] The real Ladybug is Chloe Bourgeois, everyone. Who are you? [mumbling] I thought you were Ladybug. Sorry to bust your news story. Next time double-check your facts. You'll be sorry. [Chloe yells] Alya? Alya's been disconnected. I'm Lady Wifi. Newsflash. Ladybug, let's find out who you really are. [zapping] Follow me. [Cat Noir] What's the plan? Her powers come from her phone. In the basement, there's no service. [Cat Noir] No service, no power. Nice one. We have to go lower. [Lady Wifi] I've got you, Ladybug. [she groans] Get ready. What do you do when you're not Ladybug? [she sighs] We're a bit busy right now. [fast footsteps] She's back in the hotel. [Cat Noir] She locked the doors. You realize we might know each other in real life? [Ladybug] I doubt it. It's locked. [Cat Noir] Not this one. [Ladybug] Get ready for an ambush. One, two, three! So much for the ambush. [Ladybug] Follow me. Where is she hiding? And what's up with all these phones? [whooshing] [cackling] How now brown cow? I thought it was you she was after. [he groans] [yelling] [Lady Wifi] You can't get me. Yes, I can. [gasping] No, no, no. Hold on in there, Ladybug! Of course, the service elevator. [banging] [she groans] Who is Ladybug? Is she a superhero or a super-weirdo? How can we trust the girl when we have no idea who she is? We have the right to know. [groaning] Why doesn't it come off? Because it's magic? [beeping] [Cat Noir] You're out of minutes, Lady Wifi. How romantic. Tomcat's come to save his lovebug. I am not his lovebug. We'll come back to that later. [zapping] [Plagg shivers] Oh, my ring. [Plagg pants] So chilly in here. [Adrien] Where is it? I could use help. [Lady Wifi] What am I gonna do with both of you? [Hawk Moth] Get her to use her lucky charm. She'll switch back, her identity will be revealed and the Miraculous will be mine. If you don't get him out fast, he'll soon be slush. [she cackles] Good luck with your cat-popsicle. I have other news to cover. [police sirens] [Mayor] Come on! [sobbing] [phone rings] [they gasp] [Lady Wifi] What's up, peeps? Listen everyone. I present you with an award-winning news story. [banging and panting] I'll get you out, Cat Noir. [shivering] Take your time. Ladybug is about to drop the bomb on her real identity. Lucky charm! This better be some lucky box. [clinking] Of course, the microwaves. Gotcha. Gotcha! Come on, micro-thingies, jam the signal. [fizzing] [shivering] [she gasps] You OK, Cat Noir? [bleeping] You used your lucky charm. There's not much time. Exactly. [Cat Noir] Zap open the door. We can't, the microwave's busted. [whispering] Here's what we'll do. Got it. [giggling] What is she up to? Don't let my Miraculous get away. Right. I'll jam the wifi antenna. Good luck. [elevator beeps] [gasping] [buzzing] Here you are. Cataclysm! Nice idea, kitty-cat but I won't let you cut me off so easily. [he groans] [bleeping] Hurry, Cat Noir. No! [yelling] Lost the signal. Give me that phone! [evil laugh] [groaning] No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma. Time to de-evilize! Gotcha! Bye-bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! What? Pound it! Ladybug, wow... and Cat Noir! Can I get a quick interview? I'll grab my phone. [bleeping] Gotta go. You've only got a minute. So... No, where did they go? [gasping] Stay. I won't tell anyone who you are, cat's honor. Nobody must know who we really are, not even us. [whooshing] [he sighs] [Tikki sighs] That was close. Tell me about it. [comic music] You were about to know who your love is. What were you thinking? That's the thing. I wasn't thinking. I followed my heart. Your mask will fall one day, Ladybug. Then you'll have to hand over your precious Miraculous. [Tikki] Is that true? You're gonna tell him? Is that what your heart says? Your heart tells you one thing, but a superhero listens to her head. [Alya] Got it! My new smartphone puts the old one to shame. Just look at these pics. What's with all these photos of Adrien? Well... with a mask and a costume... doesn't he look like Cat Noir? Are you out of your mind? He's tons more legit than Cat Noir. I happen to think that Cat Noir is pretty slick. Stop taking photos of Adrien... unless you give them to me. -Give it back! -No. Come on, what if you drop it? You're so clumsy. [they giggle] [cheerful music] [lively music]
