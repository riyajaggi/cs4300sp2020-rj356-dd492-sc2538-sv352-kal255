 You're sure it's not better without? Either way, you look perfect. It's not every day you celebrate your 20th wedding anniversary. [father] Marinette! Can you come here? Well? Well what? My moustache, I groomed it. Is it too short? Should I shave it off? Is it crooked? You look perfect, dad... Except for one thing. Thanks, sweetheart. No problem, dad. You're going to be late. Mrs. Chamack is coming to pick up her Eiffel Tower cake

 in 30 minutes. I'm depending on you. Yeah, yeah, no sweat, piece of cake. [questioning sigh] Married 20 years... pretty cool isn't it, Tikki? Time flies when you're having fun. Not when you're doing homework. [Tikki chuckles] Hey. They're Marinette's parents, a chick I hang out with. Yes, I remember. They make the best bread in Paris. Couldn't you have made more effort to dress nicely? What d'you mean? I took off my cap. But this is a special day. Well, it's only a birthday. [he tuts] No... This is a special birthday. This family heirloom was made by an ancestor many years ago. It's been passed down through the generations, on the fifteenth birthday, and today, it's your turn to inherit it. It's sweet, but I've already got a watch, synched to my phone. Sometimes, there's more to things than meets the eye. Let's just say our ancestor was... [twinkling] ahead of his time. Of course, I'd understand if you'd rather me buy you a new pair of rollerblades. No, dad, I'm stoked. It's awesome, thank you. [her phone rings] Are your friends waiting? Yeah, but I don't want to bail on you, it's cool. No, no, go ahead. Now take good care of it. Yeah. Come on, Marinette, you can do it. Just remember the formula. Think, Marinette. I might be able to if you weren't distracting me. Hey, Alya. What's up? The what? The bet between Alix and Kim? No, of course I didn't forget. I've made the banner. I know everyone's counting on me. In five minutes? No sweat. I'm on my way already. Be right there. But you have to wait for Mrs. Chamack. I've 20 minutes before she arrives. I told them I'd do the banner. They're counting on me. Besides, Adrien will be there. You'll never make it to Trocadéro in five minutes, it's too far. Not too far for Ladybug. Tikki, spots on! [whooshing] Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK That's beautiful. Impressive, Marinette. You've picked the wrong side. Alix hasn't even shown up. Probably too chicken to race an athlete like me. [Alix] Spoke too soon, Kim. Your ridiculous bets are over. I'm gonna leave you in the dust, meathead. You're no match for me. My neck's bigger than your thigh. Is that a good thing? Let's review the official rules. Two laps around the fountains, approximately 500 yards. The first over the line is the victor. If Kim wins, Alix will relinquish her rollerblades to him. If Alix wins, Kim will be prohibited from making any dares for the rest of the school year. We're through with those stupid dares. -Yeah, that's right! -No more dares! On your marks. Get set... Hold up! [he groans, the crowd giggles] Forfeiting already? Hold on to this, Alya. I don't want to drop it. Hold on, girl. I can't. I... Guard it with your life. It's a family heirloom. But... Marinette, take this. I gotta record the race for my blog. On your marks. Get set. Go! But she asked you to look after it. I've gotta hold the banner. Need any help? Wh...? Yep, thanks, Gotta be careful, even if you are amazing... At... holding things... in your hands. [cheering] Last lap. Amazing at holding things? Adrikins? Whatcha got there? Some super-old case or something? Careful, it's Alix's. If it's Alix's, it's probably worthless. Give it back to Adrien, Chloé. Yeah! I call a rematch. That false start threw me off. Did you do this? I had to record the race, so I gave it to Marinette. She had the banner so she gave it to Adrien. Then Chloé snatched it and dropped it. Then you skated over it. My old man gave me this for my birthday. This watch is totally a family heirloom. It was an accident. We didn't mean any harm. As if... I totally had nothing to do with this. You're all to blame! [she sobs] Alix, wait! -Marinette, what about the cake? -There's still time. Hide. [evil voice] Such disappointment, frustration, and negativity. How it fills my heart with exhilaration. Fly away, my little Akuma and evilize her. Bon appetit. [phone rings] It's Mrs. Chamack. -Hello. -Hi, I'm at the bakery, -but it's closed. I need my cake now. -I know you do. My daughter's home. She must be upstairs. I'll phone her now. Maybe we could fix it. This watch was sick, one of a kind. It can't be fixed! There has to be a way to get it back to how it was. Like, how? Go back in time and change the future? When you figure out how, lemme know! [phone rings] Oh no, this can't be good. Hello, dad. Timebreaker, I'm Hawk Moth. I'm granting you the power to retaliate against the people who've wronged you, and to go back in time to restore the future. But you must do me a favor in return when the time is right. You got it, Hawk Moth. Mrs. Chamack is outside waiting for her cake. I gotta go. Can't keep her waiting. She was listening to music. Run! Stop, Alix! What are you doing? The name's Timebreaker now. I'm going back in time to save my watch, using you punks to do it. Go back in time? What did you do? Why is he fading? I needed his energy. He was a pain anyway with all those bets. He deserves to disappear forever, and so do you. We've got to transform, now. Tikki, spots on! Yeah! Time out, Timebreaker. Please, help me. I'm messed up, please, please, No! [cackling] Sweet, Rose, always thinking of others before yourself. One minute. I gotta destroy her Akuma before everyone disappears. Where's is that Cat? Time to transform. Plagg, claws out! [she cackles] [bleeping] One and a half minutes. You won't be able to stop me where I'm going, Ladybug. Lemme guess, we're playing tag and you're it? Exactly! Don't let her touch you. Missed me. Just a second too late. No! Well she wastes no time, does she? The more people she freezes, the more minutes she gets to go back in time. Those kids are goners if we don't get that Akuma. Keep your hands to yourself. [Hawk Moth] Now, Timebreaker, grab her Miraculous, her earring! Cat Noir, No! Wow, six minutes in one go. Musta been those nine lives. Gotta go, the past is waiting. Timebreaker, the Miraculous! Take his ring before he disappears! Go ahead and try. Chill out, Hawk Moth, I have a sick plan. [Ladybug squeals] Wh-What just happened? [cheering] Go, Alix, yeah! We've gone back in time, haven't we? Watcha got there? Careful, it's Alix's. What is this? Some super-old case or something? If it's Alix's, it's probably worthless. Give it back to Adrien, Chloé. My watch! Chloé, put the watch down! No! Ladybug, this time it's your fault! I need more energy. I've gotta go further back in time. Ladybug, it's all Ladybug's fault! [evil voice] Could this be possible? Do I see double vision in my future? Or should I say "double villain"? Fly away, my devilish Akuma, and join this troubled soul. Everyone, get out of here! Don't let her touch you! Time to transform. [Marinette] Who are you? I don't have time to explain, but I'm you, from a few minutes in the future. She's right. I can feel it. She is you... from the future. Crazy! I know it seems unbelievable but trust me. I mean trust... yourself. And dad's gonna call me, I mean you, in two minutes. He won't be happy because Mrs. Chamack is waiting at the bakery. The cake... But I... I still have... Time? That's what I thought. She'll be early. Just leave now and take care of the cake. Don't worry, Ladybug can handle this. How do I get myself into these crazy situations? Cat Noir, I can't explain now but we've gotta capture Timebreaker's Akuma. Your life depends on it. Which life? I've got nine. I'm serious! The Akuma's in her rollerblades. [Ladybug] We've gotta release it. Am I seeing double? Another thing I don't have time to explain. The energy from these two will be enough for us to go farther back. I want my watch back. Let's do it. Whatever you do, don't let them touch you. Get the Miraculous, Timebreaker! If we were faster, they'd be no match for us. Then let's stock up on more energy first. Then we'll destroy them. Oh, hold on, here she comes now. It's fine, thanks. It's all good. Sorry again for making you wait. [Tikki] Mission accomplished. You mean Mission 1 accomplished. Time for Mission 2. Tikki, spots on! Yeah! We've got enough speed. Let's go hardcore on Ladybug and Cat Noir. Once we get their energy, we'll have enough to go back together. And get our watch! I thought we were chasing them. [they yell] Hey, need a hand? Thanks! They're insane on their rollerblades. Unstoppable on the ground. So... what if they're not on the ground? Two Ladybugs? I'm in heaven. We'd better go back now. There'll be less of them. I'm down. Don't fail me this time! [together] They're planning to go back in time again. [together] Lucky charm! [together] Any ideas? While you figure it out, I'll try to buy some time. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Of course. Cataclysm! Let's freeze her. [panicked cries] We're going too fast! We can't stop! [they yell] Now! [they yell] [together] No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma. [together] Time to de-evilize! [together] Gotcha. [together] Bye-bye, little butterfly. [together] Miraculous ladybug! [together] Pound it. Here, I think this is yours. Sweet! How did you fix it? Thank you. I shouldn't have given it to someone else to look after. It was my responsibility, my bad. Responsibility isn't something to be taken lightly. I should know. You're totally right. I'll be more careful next time. Thanks, Ladybug. I was getting used to having two Ladybugs around. Now you're going to get used to no Ladybugs around. I gotta split before I change back. She'll fall for me someday. It's just a matter of time. You slipped by me this time, Ladybug and Cat Noir, but one day, past, present, or future, you will be destroyed, and I'll have your Miraculouses! I will be unstoppable! [he cackles] Hey! So... did you have a nice anniversary? [father] We sure did. Although, it was a close call. Yeah. I'm sorry that I kept her waiting. Next time, please wait in the bakery, not in your room listening to music. Got it. I won't screw up next time. Good, cuz mom's right, there's only one Marinette, and we're counting on her.
