 Hey, you. No. We slept together, and I drank his contacts. I found these. My wedding rings? I guess your best man must have lost them. I, I didn't lose them. I can't believe you, Skobo. I asked you to keep something in your pocket. The caterer is an independent contractor, right? - Yes. - Good.

 Then, you're fired. How about you all come to the wedding? Everybody is invited. Now, I have to kill him. You can do this. You don't need anyone else. Lorna! Okay, okay. How about this? First I tell Mom how much money the cute doctor I invited makes. She'll be so happy for me, the other 40 guests you guys invited won't faze her at all. I know it won't work. I just like talking about my doctor. No. No one's going to tell her.

 Here's what we're going to do. You there. Yeah. Whatever you, you... You food people are doing here, do it for 40 more. Cut the steaks in half. Mash these baked potatoes, spread 'em thin and wide. Pile on some of these, these carrot sprigs. Whatever it takes to cover the plate. Just do it on the QT. A hundred dollars! Thanks. Should I tell the caterers or do you want to do it? Steve. As if Becca's extra doctor guest wasn't enough, the neighbors are now erecting a giant dragon, which is looming over our wedding. Yo, it's got a slide, too. Man, that's sweet. It's gonna ruin everything. Right. But another day. What is wrong with these people? I mean, we told them about the wedding. I even sent them a lovely certified letter, which included a list of charming hotels they could stay in for the weekend. All right. I'm gonna go talk to them myself. They won't listen. They hate you. That is ridiculous. Why would they hate me? Why? Let's review. You took down their Christmas lights last year. Please, it was January. You called the cops on them when their baby was crying and said that they had a gun. The police never come unless you say someone has a gun. You're right. I take it back. You're obviously the ambassador of goodwill we need to handle this delicate situation. And just what is that supposed to mean? I think you know. Here we go. Is this about me being overbearing? Because I have been hearing that tired, old bromide - all my life. - Why don't I go? They don't even know you. Well, that's probably why he should go. Yeah. Everybody loves Danny. Was it 14 or 40 extra guests? What? What part of QT didn't you understand? Any of it. I have no idea what that means. Extra guests, Steve? I'm dating a doctor. Good. We're gonna go talk to the neighbors. Okay. How do you wanna play this? Good cop, bad cop? Two Mormons on a mission? Homeland Security? Because with that bit, we don't need a warrant. No, thanks, Skobo. I got this. Is this still about me losing the rings? Because I have let that go. You know what? People are always saying that you're selfish and that you're inconsiderate, and I'm always defending you. But today... I'm... I'm a little sick of it. You're gonna go with maverick loner out for justice. That's classic, baby. Hey, I'm Danny, and I know who this guy is. Michelangelo's David. You just saved me a trip to Italy. If you're the clown we hired, I'm gonna need less jokes and more balloon animals. No, no. I'm the groom from the wedding next door. - And? - I couldn't help but notice your giant, fun dragon peeking out at us. You know, right where we're gonna have our actual ceremony. Don't get me wrong. I love dragons, Puff being my favorite. I'm not movin' it. Those people are horrible. The wife sent me a letter telling me not to flush the toilets on the right side of my house. Look... I'm sorry you've had problems with the Hopkins before, but I'm just gonna be here one day, just to marry their daughter. So if you could find it in your heart... Listen, you seem like a decent kid who is making a mistake. But today's my son's birthday. I promised him a dragon bouncy, paintball, a clown, and a Dance Dance Revolution machine, so... Yeah. Good times. Well, I get that. Yeah, I love kids. I run a camp, actually. Camp Kappawani. In fact if we could work this out, maybe I could arrange for your son to go, for free. - Is it expensive? - Ridiculously. And I'd make sure he got one of the clean mattresses. - Interesting. - Isn't it? Die! Die! What the hell? Gentlemen. Well, dragon is down. They just pulled the last kid out. Cookie? You know, if I knew that Skobo was just gonna take a knife to the thing, I would've had him cut down their horrible wind chimes. Now all I have is 40 more problems to solve with all those extra guests you invited. Come on. We can handle it. Can we? Because we need 40 linens, 40 shrimp forks, 40 wine glasses, and 40 personalized messages from the bride tucked into 40 fortune cookies. Can you make fortune cookies, Steve? Okay. Here's a thought. Our wedding planner. Apologize to Lorna. Get her to come back. Apologize. Wha... What do I have to apologize for? Well, let's face it, honey. You're a little... What? Now you, too? I'm... overbearing? Is that what you were gonna say, Steve? Is it? Well, is it? No need to thank me. Hey. It's what I do, baby. Okay? It's called taking care of business. I learned it from my father, you know? He always used to say, "Shut up, you kids, or I'll slit your throats!" I love that man. I told you to stay out of it. I was doing great with the guy. I was this close. Hey, all I know is that you had a dragon problem, and now you don't have a dragon problem. So it's down. - Yes, milady. I slew your dragon. - Yeah. And now the neighbor's mad as hell. You know, we had a small problem with this guy - that I was working out. - But you didn't work it out. I worked it out. Look, Dan-O, he got the message, okay? It's over. - Get 'em. - It's those kids! Run! Take that. This wedding is stupid. Damn it, Skobo! I suppose this is somehow my fault. This is where her assistant works. Now if anyone knows where Lorna is, it's Francis. Damn it, Jeff the Conqueror. If we douse the goblin's fire now, we'll never get the magic scepter. What do they teach you in the sixth grade these days? Excuse me. Are you Francis? How did you get in here? The steps. Good. Because I fixed them, and I wasn't sure. - I'm Jane Hopkins... - I know who you are. I thought you might be paying me a little visit. Hello, Steve. Hello... Francis. Cheese? How very nice. Steve, take one. Just take one. Francis, we were wondering if maybe... Brat? Thanks. I'm, I'm good with the cheese stick. Fine. So you've come about Lorna. Yes... Do you know where we might find her? I know a lot of things. Like the best way to clean furniture is with pantyhose. You know, Francis, we're in a bit of a hurry here. Here's where you'll find her. Not so fast, Doctor. Quid pro quo. There's something on my back. It's either a mole, a skin tag, or a tick. Got me right here. Yeah. Okay, please be careful of the walls, and don't touch anything with a monogram on it, or my mother will kill me. All right. Let's keep it moving, people. Serpentine! Serpentine! Well, Carl... You made it. Don't ask me to do it again. It's a killing field out there. Yeah, I'm really starting to hate kids. Mr. Giggles here. I heard someone has a birthday. I think you wanna be next door. I'm sorry. Hey, listen. Could I use your bathroom real quick? The kids are gonna be all over me the minute I step in the door. I won't get the chance. Sure. Upstairs is open. Who is that? That's the next door neighbor's party clown. He wanted to use the bathroom. The neighbor's birthday clown? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? That there's 15 more outside getting out of a small car? No, look. The neighbor promised his kid that clown, and we've got him. And we don't let him go until we negotiate a ceasefire. I don't know about you, but I want a beautiful and peaceful wedding. You want to kidnap a birthday clown? Well, what choice do we have? I think a lot. Come on. We're not gonna kill him, Alice. But we can't let him know that. Thank you. Don't worry. I, washed up before I... twisted it. Wait. Yeah? I'm getting married today, and now we're in this war with our neighbors, and it's ruining everything. I've been dreaming and planning for this day my entire life. Is there any way that you could talk to them? Tell them that we'll get them a new bouncy thing, and that we are so, so sorry. And then maybe you could, you know, just do that thing where you stick out your lower lip and rub your eyes like you're crying. I, I think that might really sell it. I don't know. It's... Please, Mr. Giggles. You're our only hope. Well... You helped me out. I guess I could give it a shot. Thank you! Sorry. Good news. I convinced Mr. Giggles to go apologize to our neighbors. First rule of kidnapping... Don't let the hostage go! Steve, she has a gun. I just have to say this. The smell of gunpowder makes me want you. Hello. I didn't see you standing there. I just come here to blow off some steam. I used to spin but... I find that this is a little more therapeutic. Go ahead. Tell her. I'm gonna grab some nachos and watch that gal with the Mohawk and the Uzi. Could we talk? Grab a gun. Listen, I know we have a history. But I'm dating a really cute doctor now, so... I hope things aren't gonna be weird between us. No, actually, I am glad you found someone. You deserve it. Okay, that was kind of sweet. Are you okay? Not really. I, I lost the wedding rings. I lost my sight. And... I used to think that I just treated women like crap. But apparently... I treat my best friend like crap, too. So... Are you trying to get me into bed again? You know, this isn't easy for me. I know that people consider me... Overbearing? The truth is I just care too much. Now, I just want good things for my family. I mean, I know I don't always go about it the right way, but I mean, I just want them to be happy. And to love me. I mean, is that so terrible? Wow. My! You were right. This really does help. All right, Lorna. The bottom line is... I'm sorry. But I can't apologize. It isn't my fault that I happen to be a forceful woman who knows what she wants. As am I. Yeah, and some overly sensitive people mistakenly consider me overbearing. Well, we're similar in that way. Maybe that's why we butt heads. I, I hadn't thought about it that way. Well, maybe we are two peas in a pod. It's very astute of you, Lorna. Thank you, Jane... ...I want you to come back. Please. I see. Okay. Here's what I want. I want the money you docked me. I want indoor bathroom privileges. And I want a centerpiece. My choice. Fine. And from now on, I want you to speak to me with... respect. You know I can't promise you that. Then two centerpieces and a bottle of champagne. - No. - Deal. It's been quiet for a while. Think Mr. Giggles convinced our neighbor to leave us alone? Carl. Hey, would you mind, running outside and bringing me that ashtray? Outside? You don't really want it, do you? No. I appreciate your honesty. All clear. Thanks, Carl. Looks like your clown came through. Hello? Look out your front door. What? That was the neighbor. He said to look out the front door. My God! Is that your wedding dress? But how did they get it out of my closet? The clown must have stolen it. The clown we didn't kidnap? You know... there's nothing else to do except call the police. Yeah, the cops will love hearing how we started it by destroying a child's birthday bouncy. Yeah. Maybe the doctor I'm dating will have an idea when he gets here. Becca, can you focus? We all know you have a date with a doctor. We're not calling anyone. He crossed the line. We're getting my dress back. How are we gonna do that? We're gonna play this just like capture the flag at camp. That neighbor picked the wrong bride to mess with. That was scary Alice. I remember scary Alice. I haven't seen her since I told her prom date she had herpes. I think capture the flag is a great idea. Now, I am the fastest and the most catlike and fearless. So obviously, I will grab the flag. - I don't think so. - Right. I'm an even better liar, so I will be the decoy. You can stay here and guard our flag. That's what we always told the dork with the headgear and the asthma to make him think he was included. I don't need any more help from you, Skobo. Come on, Dan-O. Where is this flag I'm supposed to guard? Here. My old prescription swim goggles. Before I got lasered. My eyes were pretty bad. They, they might be close. Wow. I didn't expect this from you. Well, guess I've matured since I started dating that... Even I'm getting tired of saying that. No, no, I'm not. My doctor! I have a doctor. It's not my fault that my parents are jerks, okay? I have always taken your side. Please, give me back my dress so I can get married and get away from these awful people. Don't I deserve to be happy? - Hey! - Crap! Run, Danny, run! Get the dress. Get the dress. Out of the way, clown! No, Danny! Don't let them shoot my dress! Danny! No! Skobo, you okay? Go, man. Save the dress. Thanks, Skobo. Hey. Earn it. I'm so cold. And after the ceremony, we will move 40 folding chairs into the tent. Any questions? All right. Go! Francis, how are we coming on those extra tables? Copy that. And we're gonna need to break into our emergency pÃ¢tÃ© reserve. You wh-what? Who eats three pounds of pÃ¢tÃ© in one day? All right. No more complaining to me about your gout. Thank God, she's back. Yes, of course. I'm gonna have to work twice as hard to fix everything she's doing. So what's happening with the neighbors? Well, it's been quiet, but that means nothing. I just saw those kids filling up bags with dog poo. Something's brewing. There's no end to this. I mean, it's... It's getting so I don't remember who started it anymore. It was me, dude. Hold on. I know how to make this right. You're a lot prettier than I remember. It's all over. Everything's gonna be great for the wedding, honey. Honey? I hate my dress. Who tracked paint into this kitchen? Lorna! She missed me, Francis. She really did. Lorna!
