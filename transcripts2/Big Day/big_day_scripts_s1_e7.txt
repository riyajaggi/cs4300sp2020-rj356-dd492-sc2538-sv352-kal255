 Wait! Wait, wait, wait. My... My contact lenses. - I drank your contacts? - I am legally blind without my glasses! You think I'm a bad influence on Danny? When you went to Mexico last summer, you lost him in a poker game! Hey, come with me to the hospital. It'll be the "take your daughter to work day" we never had. Did you ever take Alice? Just that time you pushed her out of the tree house. I just don't understand why the hospital would call you in

 on your daughter's wedding day. I know. It's my big day, too. My God. You never told them about this wedding, did you? You were too cheap. A man's brain is bleeding, Jane. All right, I can't get out. All right, this driveway should be kept clear at all times, people. Whose piece of crap is that blocking everyone in? That's me. Hey, if you're in a hurry though, you know, go ahead and take her. Just... you gotta coax her to start,

 so after you get the engine running, pump the gas a few times, let her sit for five seconds, then crank it. But if it's been more than five seconds - do not crank it. - You're driving, sport. Shotgun! No. I am not sitting in that backseat. Totally called it. I-I have to perform a delicate brain procedure. She called it, Steve. Lorna. Question. You've been doing this a while, right? What percentage of best men lose the wedding rings? I bet you it's a lot. - You lost the rings? - Shh! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! No! Shh, shh. This has to stay between us. Okay? If Freddy finds out, he's gonna totally spin this thing to make me look bad. He's been trying to knock me out of that best man position since the minute he got here. So... What do you want me to do? I just need your eyes - to help me retrace my steps. - Yeah. But wait... Can we trust your friend over here? That's a heat lamp. You are good. Thank you. That must be Brittany and Kristin. Brittany. My favorite bridesmaid. She was my Bloody Mary buddy at your shower. Alice! Jane! Brittany! My God! - What happened? - You were right. Too many Bloody Marys. But we got you a cab. Yeah, I know, and I should've gone straight home, but it was ladies' night at Boots & Spurs. I swear, if that mechanical bull had like a cup holder, I would've stayed on. But anyway, it's not that bad. I just have to wear this thing for six months. And it comes in pink. Cute, right? Yeah. Yeah, cute. - Hey! - Hey! My God, Kristin! I can't believe you're getting married! Well, I can't believe you had a baby. I know. Remember, I spent all of high school trying not to get pregnant? Yeah, but Molly is just so adorable. Look. See? What a beautiful face. - She's beautiful. - Thank you. And I don't have to breast-feed this weekend, so I can get wasted! Sorry, Brittany. No, that's okay. I can still drink. I just need help peeing. Remember, if anyone asks, there's no wedding. And that month I took off last year to play golf was Doctors Without Borders, got it? Dr. Hopkins, the ambassador's ready for you in 113. Thanks. I'd like you to meet Alice's friend, Danny, and my daughter, Becca. Becca, this is Barb. Hi, I'm Linda. I didn't know you had another daughter. All those pictures of Alice. Okay, I'm done. Thanks, Barb. Walk with me. You hear that silence? That's respect. Really? It seems more like fear. Respect. Fear. As long as they don't talk to me in the elevator. In my line of work, you kind of have to communicate or else the canoe just goes in circles. Yeah, look, nothing against your little camp. I'm sure you make summers fun. But nothing feels better than getting paid a pile of dough for making a difference in people's lives. There's one of my residents now. He's even younger than you. Already holding beating hearts in his hands. - Not really a goal of mine... - He's no smarter than you. Just really motivated. Think about it. I'll introduce you. Just... Be prepared. I'm his mentor. He's gonna make a big fuss over me. Dr. Zaks? - I'd like you to meet... - Danny? Zakster? Man. Dr. Hopkins, you know this guy? You know this guy? - Are you kidding? - Yeah, Evan was my favorite CIT when I was head counselor. - Yo, I run the camp now. - I know. I get the newsletter. My God! This is... Danny was the best boss I ever had. This is the guy that gave me the confidence to become a doctor. Wow. Hey, you still keep in touch with Booger? Yeah, yeah. He, just took his company public. What's this? This is a sterile environment, people. Someone pick this up! This isn't county! Robbie is such a good daddy. It's so weird to hear you call him Robbie. He'll always be Principal Gower to me. Hi, girls! I can't wait to see you in your dresses. Alice, can I steal you away for just a second? Alice... I think this is very selfish of you, making poor Brittany parade around in that dress after her theme-bar accident. How embarrassing for her. Mom, she's fine. And the wedding pictures, a permanent reminder of her tragedy. That's what this is about. You're worried about how she's gonna look in the pictures. What? Do you really think I am that petty? Well, since you're so concerned, I will have you know she's gonna be taking her brace off for the ceremony and suffering through the pain. Well, that's a relief. I love it. You don't notice the bruise, do you? OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn I'm sorry to have to tell you this... But... Your father didn't make it. Miss Stovekin... People deal with grief in many different ways. I'm not Miss Stovekin. - No? - No. I am so sorry! I am so bad at this! Yeah, you are. Your stethoscope's in my coffee.! Yeah. Sorry. That's... I've been up for 34 hours now. Head of surgery here has been working us like dogs. - Dr. Hopkins? - He's a real hard-ass. - He's my dad. - And an inspiration to us all. So sorry. That was a... I'm so bad at talking. How about you let me buy you a cup of coffee, and I'll... Keep quiet? Don't you have to tell the Stovekins about their father? He's not getting any better. Sweet. - What are you guys doing? - Nothing! Why? Do I need to be doing something? 'Cause I'm not. Okay. I don't think he suspects anything. - Fingers crossed. - Yes. Now the rings weren't on the lawn, where you wrestled the neighbor's dog. And they weren't in the bushes where you relieved yourself. Man, what a great night! Wait, this is Rebecca's room. What... What on earth would you be doing in here? Yeah, boy! Yes! Please tell me we're not gonna re-enact this like we did the dog wrestling scenario. Okay, I am a gentleman. So, first, I dim the lights, then I put on my slow jams... Then we started dancing... And then I nailed her on the beanbag. Let me get some gloves. I had to let the dress out a few times. I hope it looks all right. I'm sure you look fine. Pregnancy totally messes up your body. Wow, you look... great. Better than anyone could've predicted. Yay! Yay. So Zakster, he's all dressed up to scare all the campers. And they all scream like they're supposed to except for little Peter Rochowski, aka Petey The Puker. If anyone is interested, the ambassador will live. Great. Go on, Danny. You're almost at the best part. Right, okay. So anyway, so... So, Puking Petey, he gets right up in Zaks' face, and Zakster jumps out of the way, falls down all the mess hall stairs... I still have the scar. Hey, Dad. So what's the, scoop on Dr. Scott? He likes long walks on the beach, sunsets and grooving to the sounds of Neil Diamond. You know, maybe... Becca, do you like Danny? Sure. Why? Well, I like him because you don't, and everyone else likes him 'cause he's just a great guy. But he... Canoes for a living. Yeah, but that's not who he is. People are more than just their job titles, Dad. Now you sound like a nurse. I'm gonna go through the underwear drawer one more time. You've been pretty thorough there. Lorna. There is no time for romping around in here. Now what is the status of the new photographer? Well, I put in a phone call... Are we still talking about this, or are we doing something? I gotta go. What? W-w-w-whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. - What about the rings? - I'm sorry, but Jane said... I know what she said. I just can't believe you let her speak to you like that. Well, you know, it's just the nature of the client-planner relationship. Lornzie, you need to stand up for yourself, okay, baby. You need to be a firecracker. - Firecracker. - Hell, yeah. Jane needs to know that you are dangerous. You could blow her fingers off. I want to see you be a firecracker. Not now. After we find the rings. - But that's good. - Right, right. What? Why is there a turkey sandwich under the covers? That's right. That I raided the fridge, And then we did it again in the bed. They must be in the fridge. Skobo. Freddy. Where are they? Where are they? Looking for something? What? No. Just hungry. All right. Enjoy your snack. I will. Jane, Alice showed us the tent outside. It looks so good. Thanks, but we still have an awful lot to... My. Well, is there anything that we can do to help? No, no, no, no. I think you girls have done enough. Maybe you should go change. I mean, God forbid you should ruin those dresses and have to walk down the aisle in a parka. Excuse me. Sorry. Alice... First a cripple, and now a porn star? Mom, would you please stop obsessing over how my friends look? It is so not a big deal. Really? So... It doesn't bother you at all? No. Because I am not egotistical and shallow abou... Then what... are these? Whoa. Fine. Okay, you saw them. Okay, we didn't need a tent. We all could have taken shelter under Kristin's giant milk bags. Sweetie. You have every right to be angry. I mean, this is our day! I never wanted to be a bridezilla. You know, I wanted to be the cool, laid-back bride who glows and hugs. So, how do we take out boobs and bruisey? So I was in the parking lot, and I realized. I left my keys in Mr. Feinman. My God! But it wasn't till I opened him back up that I remembered... My keys were in my pocket. Look, I don't know what time you get off work... Would you like to be my date to my sister's wedding tonight? Absolutely. Wait. You have a sister? Man, I love you. Too soon? Cool. Okay. Kristin's allergic to peanuts. We spike her tea with peanut oil. Peanut oil that's good. Nah, that might kill her, or worse, make her boobs swell up even bigger. There's gotta be something. Shawls? You want us to wear shawls? Big, draping shawls. How can Kristin feel self-conscious? She looks great! You know, postpartum hormones. For six months after Becca was born, I used to stand over Steve with a pillow while he slept. So anyway, shawls... But won't that look bad? - Brittany's so self-conscious about that bruise. - Isn't her comfort more important than how we look? You're right. Are you gonna wear a shawl, too? No. It's what Brittany would want. - Becca, Danny, let's go. - All right. Hey, it looks like I gotta get going here. But hey, Arnie, good luck in the triathlon, all right? And um, Linda, hey, tell your husband to keep his head up. He's gonna find work soon. - Yeah. - He will. All right, and, Rog, fight the good fight, buddy. All right! - Bye, Becca. - See, you guys. Bye, Dr. Hopkins. I'll see you at the wedding tonight. What wedding? Lorna, I need you to find sateen shawls in platinum for all the bridesmaids. But it's day of. Platinum is a custom order. - I don't even know where... - Just do it. What are you waiting for? Mrs. Hopkins, I am so... I'm sorry. But I am working very hard to make sure that today is a magical day for you and your daughter. And I cannot waste time on a wild goose chase. And while we are having this open dialogue, I was hoping that we could incorporate just a little more respect into our client-planner relationship. Say something? You're fired. Didn't that feel great? You didn't invite any of us, did you? Please! No one likes going to co-worker weddings. I didn't like going to yours. - What? - I mean, come on... Destination wedding to Fresno? Wait, wait! This is all my fault. Um... I wanted to keep the wedding small. And, Steve, you were right. You know, these people, they are your family. And, I'm sorry I didn't let you invite them. Aw! Steve... This must've been so hard for you to have to hide from us. You said we were your family? Um... Yes? Steve! - Danny, you're getting married? - Right! - Congratulations! - Wow. That's so great! Thank you so much. Thank you. Looks like Danny canoed your butt out of a certain creek. He did. I guess I really owe him. You know, why don't you all come to the wedding? - You know what? Everybody's invited! - You, too, Rog! And now... I have to kill him. Team! Team! Could you hold the work, please? I have an announcement that I need to make. Now, I have tried to shield you from the dark underbelly lurking beneath the taffeta and the fondant. But it's time I pull the Italian-laced veil from your eyes. I've been fired. And now, she thinks... That all... This whole wedding can take place without me. And maybe she is right. But without all of us... What's left? Just the bride and the groom... And the minister... And some witnesses... A few subcontractors... Okay. Just a minute. Um, my whole point is... We are firecrackers, and the fuse has been lit. So let's blow this sucker out of the water? Who's with me? Sorry, Lorna, we're gonna need the chair. Yeah, sure. Sorry. Well, think about it. What took you so long? Sorry. I was saving a man's life. You know, Steve, I am getting a little tired of that excuse. Danny. Back from the hospital so soon. It was awesome. I met someone. A doctor. Divorced? Socially awkward? You can find out for yourself. I invited him to the wedding. What? Don't you do this to me, Becca. Lorna just quit on me, I am having issues with the bridesmaids, and now you want me to accommodate another guest? Yeah and while we're on the subject of extra guests, I think Danny has something to tell you. - Danny. - Yeah? Wow. Everybody's here. Well... I didn't want to make such a big deal about this, but I found these... outside. My wedding rings? I guess your best man must have lost 'em? I, I didn't lose them... - Okay? - No. Then why were they outside by the tire swing? Do you remember the tire swing? They'll be sorry when they read my blog. Lorna's gone. There's not gonna be any shawls. You're gonna have to be the bigger person. We have to double stuff. I can't believe you, Skobo. I didn't ask you to plan anything. I didn't ask you to do anything. I asked you to keep something in your pocket. So much setup left and so little time. But it's okay. You can do this. You don't need anyone else. This is your day to shine. Lorna!
