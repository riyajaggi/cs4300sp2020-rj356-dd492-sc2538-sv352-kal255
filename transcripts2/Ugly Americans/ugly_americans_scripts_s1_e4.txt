YO, JUST 'CAUSE I'M DEAD DON'T MEAN MY TIME AIN'T PRECIOUS! - LOOK, BLOB, I'M GONNA LEVEL WITH YOU. I HAVEN'T ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH MY CASE FILES, BUT YOU'VE GOT THE ONE THING THEY DIDN'T HAVE, A MOSTLY SOBER ME, AND I DON'T PLAN ON FAILING YOU LIKE I DID THE OTHERS. ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE START? pop! OH, I'M SORRY. I DON'T THINK OF YOU THAT WAY. - [gurgles] - FORTUNATELY, EVERY WIZARD HAS A BOOK OF MAGIC TRICKS UP HIS SLEEVE. MINE JUST SO HAPPENS TO BE  COSMOPOLITAN. - CAN I HELP YOU? - YEAH, I'LL HAVE THE ALL-AMERICAN. - UH...TELL ME, WHAT COMES IN THE STEW? - NOT BRAINS. - I SEE.

[gunshot] OH, MY GOD. - YEAH, THEY STILL GET SHOT OUT HERE. IT SUCKS, BUT I GET IT. JUST HEAR 'EM STUMBLE AROUND GOING, "BRAINS." [mumbling] THEY CAN'T EVEN SAY "BRAINS" RIGHT. - I DON'T BELIEVE IT. - WELL, IT'S JUST FOR SPORT, YOU KNOW, ZOMBIE TIPPING, ZOMBIE HUNTING. THERE'S "RIP THE ARM OFF THE ZOMBIE," "PIN THE ARM BACK ON THE ZOMBIE," "ZOMBIE SOCCER"-- THAT'S REALLY-- THEY JUST KICK YOU IN THE NUTS. THAT'S NOT EVEN A GAME. THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED "ZAPE," WHICH, BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS. - [moaning] [gunshot] - UGH. [upbeat hip-hop music] *  - YOU KNOW, GIVING YOU THE GIFT OF SPEECH MIGHT TAKE A FAR MORE GENIUS MIND THAN EITHER OF OURS, MY FRIEND. LUCKILY, I'M CONNECTED. SO YOU SEE, MR.

ALL RIGHT, COME OUT WHEN YOU'RE DONE. - DONE WITH WHAT? - HEY, DAD. - TALK TO ME DURING THE COMMERCIAL. - ALWAYS DUCKING OUT TO BE WITH HIS FRIENDS. NOTHING EVER CHANGES. MARK, SIT. I'LL GET THE PHOTO ALBUM. MAYBE WE COULD PULL ROGER AWAY FROM HIS HISTORY CHANNEL! - IT WAS THE '60s. WOMEN WERE BURNING BRAS.

LET'S SEE THAT BASTARD TRY TO REVIEW A MOVIE NOW. - OH, ROGER, IT'S JUST A THUMB. - IRONIC, HUH? YOU SPENT YOUR YOUTH FIGHTING ZOMBIES, AND THEN YOUR SON BECOMES ONE. - ONE WHAT? - NO, I'M SAYING IT'S ADMIRABLE THAT YOU CAN LOVE RANDALL THE WAY YOU DO DESPITE HIS BEING A ZOMBIE. [both gasp] THIS WOULD BE A GREAT TEACHABLE MOMENT FOR ONE OF MY GROUP SESSIONS. - HE'S SAYING RANDALL'S A ZOMBIE? - YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA GO SEE WHAT THAT COLD SACK OF FLESH IS UP TO. - WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT BACK THERE? - [computer voice] THE [bleep] IF I KNOW. - I'M ASSUMING YOU MEANT TO TYPE "TRUCK THAT I TOW"? - [computer voice] DON'T BE AN ASS[bleep]. - OKAY, THESE ARE GETTING HARDER TO MISINTERPRET.

I MEAN, HE'S BLOWN HIS HAND CLEAN OFF HIS BODY. HE'S TAKEN A LAWN DART IN THE NECK.

IF YOU KEEP INTERRUPTING ME, I'M GONNA FORGET MY SPIEL. NOW, OVER HERE, WE HAVE THE PINE BARRENS, WHERE THE FIRST-EVER CULTIVATED BLUEBERRIES WERE DEVELOPED IN 1916. - WHAT PART OF DEAD DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? - WAIT. WAIT. GO BACK A BIT. DID YOU SAY THE BODIES ARE GETTING MIXED TOGETHER WITH THE TOXIC WASTE? - [sighs] NOW I GOT TO LOOK AT THE BROCHURE. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS. - BY THE WAY, YOU'RE REALLY GONNA HAVE TO WORK ON YOUR PATTER A LITTLE BIT. LEONARD, IT'S MARK. LISTEN, I THINK I KNOW WHERE THE BLOB COMES FROM. - HE'S A WHAT? NO KIDDING. THE BYPRODUCT OF MOB SNITCHES? DON'T WORRY. I KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO. AH. BACK IN THE SADDLE. - HOW COULD YOU GO ZOMBIE ON US, RANDALL, AFTER ALL WE'VE DONE FOR YOU? - GO EASY ON HIM, ROGER. IT'S NOT A CHOICE. - UM...ACTUALLY, IT WAS A CHOICE. I WAS TRYING TO BANG THIS HOT CHICK, BUT IT TURNED OUT SHE LIKED WARLOCKS, SO I REALLY MISHEARD. - AND DID YOU THINK OF YOUR MOTHER AND I AT THAT TIME? - HONESTLY, I DID MY BEST NOT TO. - YOU'VE LEFT ME LITTLE CHOICE, RANDALL. - HONEY, MOVE CLOSER. YOUR FATHER'S NOT A VERY GOOD SHOT. - HEY, BLOB, COME. SIT DOWN FOR A SECOND. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. I'M GONNA SPEAK ROBOTIC TO BLOB. - GO AHEAD. - [computer voice] I LIKE YOU, BLOB, BUT I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME. - [computer voice] I HAVE TO TAKE A DUMP. - [computer voice] AND YET YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME EVERYTHING. - I FRISKED HIM. HE'S CLEAN. - HEY, THIS IS THE LUCKY COIN THAT BELONGED TO SAMMY THE SNITCH. - [computer voice] THAT IS RIDICULOUS, BUT FOR THE RECORD, I SAW CARMINE STEAL A MEATBALL FROM YOUR PLATE. [toilet flushes] - ROGER! SMILE BIG. - WAIT TILL MY ARMY BUDDIES SEE THIS. - HURRY UP, MA, WILL YA? MY KNEES ARE KILLING ME. [camera shutter clicks] - THANK YOU, SON. THAT'LL EARN ME SOME RESPECT FROM THE BOYS. I JUST WISH I HAD FOUND OUT THAT YOU WERE A ZOMBIE SOONER. I COULD HAVE BROUGHT THE PHOTO TO THE REUNION. - THIS IS A NICE COMPROMISE, MA. GOOD THINKING. - WE LOVE YOU, SON, FLESH-EATING CORPSE OR NOT. OH, AND HERE. YOUR EAR FELL OFF THE LAST TIME YOU CAME HOME. I KEPT IT IN YOUR SCRAPBOOK WITH YOUR OTHER STUFF. - YOU KNEW ALL ALONG. - A MOTHER KNOWS. ALSO, HERE'S YOUR NOSE. I FOUND IT IN THE SOFA CUSHIONS. - UH, THAT ONE'S NOT MINE. - EW. - LOOK AT THAT, CITIZENSHIP AND YOUR PICTURE IN THE PAPER. OH, I'D SURE LIKE A COPY OF THAT. OH, THAT'S GOING ON THE SUCCESS BOARD. - [computer voice] LOOK WHO'S A BIG [bleep] NOW. - AND MAYBE A LITTLE MUSIC TO DROWN OUT THE VULGARITY. [sound-alike to Journey's  Don't Stop Believin' playing] [bell on door ringing] - HELLO, CITIZENS. - MARK, GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US, 'CAUSE EVERY TIME A BELL RINGS, A WIZARD TAKES A SHOT. - I'M PROUD OF YOU, LEONARD. YOU HANDLED THIS ALL ON YOUR OWN. - MARK, MY FRIEND, I COULD HAVE ONLY DONE IT WITHOUT YOU. - OKAY. - I THOUGHT YOU WERE BRINGING YOUR ZOMBIE FRIEND. HE'S PARKING THE VAN. [metal crunching] - WHY DON'T YOU MOVE BACK TO JERSEY, YOU JERK? *  [bell ringing] *  [bell rings] [music stops abruptly] - HEY, WHO TURNED OFF THE LIGHTS? [gunshot] - AND STAY DEAD. HEY, THANKS FOR THE TIP, STEVIE. [wheelchair motor whirring] - THE PLEASURE WAS MINE. - [computer voice] EW, THIS IS ALL WET AND STUFF. - I JUST CAN'T STOP WONDERING WHERE THEY PLACED HIM. - DON'T FEEL BAD, BUDDY. THERE'LL BE OTHERS. - THAT'S SWEET OF YOU, MARK, BUT UNLESS THEY'RE TELLING ME TO GO [bleep] MYSELF... [sighs] THEY WON'T BE THE SAME AS THE BLOB. - WE'RE OFTEN TOLD TO STAY AWAY FROM FOUR-LETTER WORDS LIKE "[bleep]" AND "[bleep]" AND "JEW-Y." MAYBE IT'S NOT THE WORDS WE USE BUT HOW WE USE THEM. THEN AGAIN, MAYBE IT'S JUST KNOWING WHEN TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. [gunfire] - ALL RIGHT, POP, I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH PRACTICE FOR TODAY. - THIS IS GREAT. I LOVE HAVING A GAY ZOMBIE AS A SON. - WAIT, WHO'S GAY? [gunshot] [screams]
