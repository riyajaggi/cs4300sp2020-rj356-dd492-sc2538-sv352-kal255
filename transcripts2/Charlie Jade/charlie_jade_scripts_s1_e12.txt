 It's a mess. Must be the highlight of your week. One vexcor executive dead by broke neck. Probably it could look like an unfortunate accident. Except for those two. Both shot dead by a single 9 mm. No much trots. One of them is also vexcor's executive. And the other used to be a mumber the hard livings. Derex Skaifi What's he doing with the vexcor group? Even more stranger, he never got a shot. which means other someone shot both men. Then threw the woman off the catwalk. But why not shot her too. It's too perplexed. Well, try me, I'm orias. Or someone was watching them from there. Skaifi he comes out of there somewhere. Murders the women. But doesn't the man... Which means Skaifi was working with the vexcor man. Maybe the vexcor man took her here. So Skaifi can murder her. Could make it look like an accident. -So who ever is watching, cease the murder. -No. Shots both men, and leaves. You've been watching too much CSI. You wanna go have some fun? Do you remember 01 boxer? Well, it turns out he's hiding in his own club. He gonna take off. No, if you told me 01 boxer had connection... To the vexcor's explosion, it beginning interesting. All work are not play. Come on, I'm having fun here, are't I? See you later. Bye. I thought it was Gemma You gotta face it, she's gone. Come on. You've been searching for her for a month now. I mean, they're killing their own. Yeah, so what? I getting desperate. So, how do you know she's still alive? I don't know. But I owe to her to find out. Charlie, what are you fighting? what? Gemma saved you, because she thought you could... Do something about what happening here. You know what Kogger said. Charlie, there is a purpose to you being here. A reason. What are you talking about? Purpose? -Reason? -Yes. I'm not supposed to be here. 01 doesn't take Katie Grayle to cape city. None of these happens. It doesn't matter What you do here and now, that's what important. More important than anything... -You could ever do in Alpha. -That's bull shit. You know a god dam thing about what's important to me. I had a life back there. I had a woman who love me. You know what, I don't care. I don't care. A woman? If Krogg is right everything in this world... Everything and everyone is going to die. Yeah. I shouldn't come here, shouldn't come here. Go, go, go. Take those alphaverse bastards with you. Go, go find your woman. Her name is Jasmine. Verse alphaverse Verse betaverse I don't buy it. Sir. We have gone over krogg's report over and over. And we don't understand his worry. Doesn't that bother you that you don't understand. And what about the seepage? Lakes appearing and disappearing... Right near where the primary link blew up. We've adjusted our theoretical model to include the seepage. -That's without running the first test. -Then if you do... Run the test. You could... Destabilize the membrane. And this universe could collapse. We'll hold running a test on the new link. That will be all. You never believe Krogg's meno before. -Why are you choosing to believe it now? -Choosing? Don't tell me you've had a change of heart. What? Are you accusing me of it? Keeping the link shuts, you don't have to deal with home office. I could accuse you letting Charlie Jade walk out of here... Just to make me look incompetent. That's for our own security. You wanna bet that these make 6 o'clock news? The woman was ready to boat. We needed to send a message to the others. So it was supposed to be just her. And? Someone intercepted my team. -Nice job, stabilizing your work force. -I... I can't stabilize the work force till the link is back up. Then find me someone who can. -What the...  -Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Mostly enough. I'm so glad you called. Look, I know I chose this crusade. And you didn't. I also know what it is like to lose somebody. What if I can tell you a way to get back home? How do I know that you were just go back and forget all about it. You get a way to get me home? Maybe. All right. But... We know O1 can travel back to your world... Without the link. Right? And we know that he took Katie Grayle with him. So why he wouldn't be able to take you? People are asking about you. I hate to miss a good party. I will be so sad... If you ganna get arrested. Don't tease me. I hate being teased. You love being teased. Good evening, square. I told you I like your club. You will be detained as a material witness... of the murder of Janet Maresh. Open up. I said open up! I hear you're sick. Someone says you're dying. I'm not dying. I want you out of here. You find somewhere else to die. What do you think you're doing? I'm gonna be late for work. You don't think they gonna figure out who you are? You are in the belly of the dragon china. You'd better get out of there. Nobody knows who I am. Everybody knows who you are. Wait, wait. Maybe we could wait until he gets out on bail. No time. Now you're in a hurry save our world or your woman? Is there anyway to get him out of the police station. I don't know. Maybe we could... Wait till they transfer him to the jail... Hijack the transfer man. So what you're saying is... You have no evidence that I killed Janet Maresh. No witnesses. Nothing. Did you find the dead in my club? Would it help you that if I just took committed that I did it? We know. We know you did it. I can get you a deal. We are not gonna hijack the van, but maybe we could get inside. Turn the hijack to the trasfer process. Well, inspector. I am an innocent man. O1 Boxer has been detained by the police. I need to finish the job. You needed to do the job right the first time. I've had enough. You're not going anywhere. You will be detected as a material witness in the murder. Can I get some more water? Now he is in police custody. And the last thing we need is more attention from the police. What if he's be in Alpha verse. Then eliminating him won't help. Do you want to explain to Essa why we would kill Brion's son? Do you want to explain how Charlie Jade get into my office... And you let him go without my authorization? If you had eliminated Gemma Gitano he never would get to the building. You screw it up, you handle it. That's leadership for you. It must be hard delegating all those decisions? Before the link went down... All you had to do was passing along orders. Just get it done. Silently, invisiblely. Because as far as I am concerned... You're the one who give the order. Yeah. I'll be fine. So you were at site of Vexcor disaster? Are you a good witch? Or you are a bad witch? Do you know any of these people? Are you busy for the next policeman's ball? S.S.E's office. Yeah, this is detective Will Arthur... From North West police station in Cape Town. Returning the SSE's call. Please hold. Are you ready for this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Inspector Author? Yes, I received the fax from the ministry. You're telling me that O1 Boxer is a suspected terrorist? Oh well, we can't review the details But he used to link to the Al-Caeda Finacial Network. Well he runs a club in Cape Town. We are holding him for murder. Well just because you're a member of terrorist orgnazation... Doesn't mean you're not a criminal. Well, Sir. We'll be perfectly happy to make him available... For questioning here at the station. With all due respect to the S.A.P. We feel that we have an edge with our interrogation techniques here. You are on our side, or you're not? Against terrorist. I thought so. Nice doing business with you. Phone call and couple of pieces of paper. You went for it. You say terrorists these days everyone shuts their brain up. And remember, be superior. Explain as little as possible. Here, never take this off. Why? I don't know. It's FBI thing. There's no point running forward. That's your mistake running forward. You'll never fix what you've done that way. What am I supposed to do? You have to go back. Then it's easier. Go back. In time. Nobody can go back in time. Nobody can visit another universe. But you did. I didn't mean to do that. You pulled the triger. The consequences are at your door. Or all splattered around your house... In my case. I'm sorry about your head. You have to go back. Don't you blow up the reactor. But if I don't blow up the reactor. It will destory my world. Tell you a secret. The world is destroyed every single day. No, don't. It's already in order and we've get an e-mail from your boss, so... Wait here. You know. I just wanna say I think it sucks! The FBI going around the world... Acting like you run the show. Well, it sucks. Inspector. Whose side are you on here. What were you doing at the reactor site anyway. -We've done with him. -I'm not done with him. The FBI is here. It's their party now. What do they know about you that you're not telling me. At least let us know, cause you'll certainly wind up telling them -I've got a big weewee. -Come on. Where the hell is this FBI agent? Special Agent Anderson. Tom Anderson. your man is down at processing. I can take you there, but you need to check in your weapon first. That'll take about 15 minutes. Paper work, your know. Tell me about it. Would you like some coffee? No, actually I'm pretty well right now. Thank you. Since you work in terrorism, I was... Wondering if i could pick your brain a bit. We actually not liberally discuss details of our cases. It's a procedural question, actually. Please? I'll tell you what I can. So how long have you been with the agency? Pretty much my whole adult life, I guess. Since I got out of school. The toys you boys would get to play with. We've been come here across a lot these. I thought maybe you might be able to fill me in on aspect a bit. You can find them all over Cape Town. I don't know some kind of infestation. It's a bureau actually. what is? It's a bureau, not an agency. Federal Bureau of Investigation? You should've corrected me. They always do. You know what? I figure I'll go for that cup of coffee. The Vexcor explosion. What were you doing there? Who are you really? I was part of an anti-terrorist task force. Tracking her. Why does everybody think she is a terrorist? Information we picked up from encrypted cellphones. Usual you can tell. Mr, whatever your name really is. Anderson. Anderson. I've been a police officer for thirteen years. My father was a police officer. I've heard a lot of ridiculous stories. Some of them turned out to be true. Yours however. Is not one of the true ones. Yeah, your paperwork was impeccable. You reroute a call coming from this station on an optical line. There you are. Impressive. Are you a spy? No. See, now there I believe you. And what about these little mechanical bug things? Ectoderm scan devices. Mobile surveillance Units. -And who manufactures them? -Vexcor. Do you work for Vexcor? No. I'm a freelancer. Well, that's just between you and me. Let me see that. Urgent prisoner tansfer? Your captain called it in. -we are about to release him to the FBI. -Really? We've got nothing on him. -Why they pick up?  -Well, you tell me. Great! I'll be right back. So, why were you so anxious to spin 01 Boxer from here? Why we not go out for a coffee, then I'll tell you. You are not going anywhere. You in person act the offence of the law. Would it surprise if I told you... The Vexcor would like nothing better than... Coming down here and put a bullet in my head? Considering you've killed three of their employees. I am not surprised. Yeah, I heard about that on the radio. Their executives were dropping like flies. Do you remember Elliot Krogg? Their head of research. That's where all started. Vexcor is not a company. It's a criminal organization. Do you have any idea... What they worked on that facility before it blew up? Not really. You let me walk out of that door, I'll tell you all about it. You're perfectly safe here. No offence, but i'm not too... Terribly impressed by your security systems. Your partner was bet to let me walk'ut of here with a prisoner and a tail. Too shame. Some of these fingerprints here... -Have someone run them now and get back to me. -Yeah. Hey, come on. And good luck to you. Where is he going? Prisoner transfer. Now he is the central processing's problem now. He's rather popular, isn't he? Arthur, you don't find it all that someone else... Wants to transfer him out of our police station? Well, the captain called it in. Of course he did. Thanks for taking this criminal off my hands. It's our pleasure. Hey, if you find Van Tanda in central processing. Tell him I'm still up for that date. Will do. Van Tanda isn't a woman. Is anyone around here a real cop? Calm down, miss. Van Tanda is a woman. I thought you said she. Van Tanda is a man, baby. Take their weapons. How did he know? This is ridiculous, sir. Can I make a phone call. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Cover your ears. Come on. Thanks for being a mirror. What you expect. Let's get out of here! -The paramedics are on their way.  -I'm fine. -We're all gonna have to get checked out.  -I'm fine! Let's just assemble a team. Find 01 Boxer if we can. Maybe he can explain to us why they're so anxious to kidnap him. We are not going anywhere... until we get checked up by paramedics. Union rules. Besides, what's the point to go out anywhere... If we don't know what we are up against. Your ear. Maybe surveillance camera recorded something. Hey Karl Let me ask you a question. What exactly was your plan? We're gonna walk into that Cop Shop. Tell them your name is Nelson Nandela? Like I said. I was praying. Yeah. You've gotta have to try that some time. Works for me. Thanks. They want me to go in for a MRI tomorrow. Oh, thank god. I don't wanna go in for MRI. I wanna lift this guy's prints off the counting. Run it through the computor. We have evidence techies all over the place. Let them take care of it. Officer. What's the story with those liftprints We're lifting prints now. I'm sorry, inspector. The surveillance cameras are hunting no function... Throughout the entire incident. Why doesn't that surprise me? Let's get some sketch artists in here. Put their faces on TV. Are the news cameras still out there? On it. What about your new friend? Got his finger-prints. They don't show up in the database of course. But I'm going to find him... Sonner or later. He's going to answer all my questions. Well, well, well, look who's waking up. Morining, sunshine. Come on, man. What do you...what do you... -Guess you own my life. -Do you? Yeah. You know who those guys were? Who were they? Hey Miss Daisy. Would tell your driver not to interupt? Glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor. Uw...woosh, do that again. You're losing about a thousand brain cells a second hanging like that. So you wanna be cute. You go right ahead. Should we bring him down? No, let him stay until he passes out. You wanna a cup of coffee? Wakey, wakey. Just gimme five more minutes, dad. The crew in the station. You know them. I know you. You followed me that day at Cape City the day that reactor blew up. I had you checked out. What are you doing here, Charlie Jade? I don't know, why don't you tell me. Hey sugar. Can I get a coffee, make it black. Why don't you tell me what happened to you. We'll put two and two together. I love good bedtime story. Enough with the games. You know what Krogg was warning Vexcor about. Why don't you remind me. The universes... They collapse if that link goes up again. And that's way over your head, isn't it? What's that got to do with the little bondage fantasy... You guys got going on here anyways? Cape City. You can take me there. You can take me there. Sure. I'm 01, fly me. You took Katie Grayle, you can take me. Katie who? I'm not asking. Why are you so anxious to get back? The crime rate is really high there. Not to mention the rent. Do you know how many people you have to kill... To get one of those reservations by the waterfront? Not to mention... A high class hooker to be your slave. Jesus, Charlie. I'm sorry. Wasn't I suppose to mention the slave part? What the hell is he talking about? I think maybe you don't wanna be a part of this. -Charlie. -Why don't you wait in the car? -What the hell is going on? -Go wait in the car. Hey, why does she get to go? Hey I'm serious about the coffee. You know I promised my friend Karl... That I'm gonna kill you. -Really? -Yeah, I just pull you out of your misery. So. You wanna get back to your woman. Is that it? Yeah, something like that. You found out Krogg's big secret. And now you wanna run back to Cape City to be with your concubine. Classic. Well, who really cares about this universe anyways, chak? Not our universe, is it? The real question you wanna ask yourself is... Who's screwing Charlie's girl. Or should I said. Who isn't screwing Charlie's girl Let's talk about you. Let's talk about travel. How do you travel? Tell me about the water. Your're worse than I am. How was that? Well I may have killed a few people. I may have even enjoyed it. But you wanna walk away from ten billion people. Ten billion people. And they're all gonna die without your help. Which one of us is a psychopath? Last time. Can you or can you not... Take me back to Cape City. Can't do it. Then why don't you give me one good reason. Not to blow your brains out. How about I give you twelve? You. What are you doing here? What I always do. I'm here to tidy it up. Oh great, our whole project shot to hell. Yes, now your face is in every police station in the country. That's foolish fault, he gave me bad intelligent. I completely sympathize. But I don't make policy. I'm just a freelancer. What's going on? I need your car. You're letting him go. Yeah. I'll explain later. You're crazy. What did he say about Cape City? He can't take me there. Are you believing words he said? Some of it, yeah. What did he tell you? A Lot of things.
