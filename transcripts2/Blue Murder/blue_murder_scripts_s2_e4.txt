 PHOTOGRAPHER: Excuse me, sir. You were fixing the waste pipe? Yes. I was lying on the floor on my back and-- I could feel some water creeping up from behind. And I thought it wasfrom the washing machine. And then I looked, and-- there was blood mixed in. I was-- I was lying in her blood. Oh. JANINE: OK, OK, OK. Just sit down. You're all right. Yeah, yeah. Breathe deeply. Just sit. Deep. That's OK. All right. Yeah, yeah. I couldn't see it at first,but the door was shut. So I got up and followed thetrail and, well, there she was. What then? Um, I phoned the ambulance. JANINE: Not the police? No, no. I phoned them second. I thought she was still alive. Was there anyone else around at the time? No. No, there wasn't. Look, I know how this must-- look. SOCO: Boss. Yeah? You all right? Well, someone couldn't wait. Does she have a pet? No. JANINE: I want your lot workingthrough the night on this, and I want your preliminaryfindings for a briefing first thing tomorrow. Boss. - Good morning. - Boss. - Good morning. - Hello. Hello. Vicki Swift. BUTCHER: On [inaudible]. To our department, lucky girl. JANINE: Welcome to the family.- Thank you, ma'am. - Boss. - Boss. JANINE: Any worries, anyproblems, you come to me. Same goes here. Yeah, thank you, Shap. OK, attention please, everybody Thank you. Diane Waugh. 24, single, registered childminder, stabbed in the neck. Now there's a chopping board inthe kitchen, chopped carrots, but no knife. That'd be the murder weapon, then. That's what the boss just said. JANINE: Now, they can'tfind the knife in the house, so SOCO are doing an external. However, they did find a puddle of urine on the landing overlooking the hall. - Are you taking the-- - Don't. Now I need to know about Diane's last movements. Any children she looked after,any friends, any family. There's no sign of a forced entry, no sign of a struggle, which could mean she knew her attacker. Larry Clopley, landlord. He discovered the body. Now, Shap, Vicki, I need toknow more about this guy. Any previous? Do interviews with neighbors. Try and build up a picture. Richard, I think you and meshould get back to that flat, try and dig up something. Thank you very much, everybody. Diana Waugh. No, not W-A-I, W-A-U-G-H. No, she's not five months old. She's 24, or was. What? Only five months? How come? Diane Waugh? What's she called, this woman?RICHARD: Waugh. Diane Waugh. Says here she's called Diane Begley. Hrm? Childminder with two identities? You know, I'm knackered just watching? So which one's the sister? We could do this somewhere else. Here's fine. This sounds awful, but I'm not that surprised. That your sister was murdered? Diane was a bit of a wild one. Except where children were concerned. But then still was one, in a way. When was the last time you saw her? July the 9th, last year,7:30 PM, just as Corrie was starting. That's very precise. We had a row. Big one. What about? She stole my fiance, Will. Will Harmon. Go on. NATALIE: Will and I had plans, big plans. But then Diane came back from ayear nannying abroad, and, uh-- I wasn't always this fat. Look, we need to talk to him. Have you got a contact number? NATALIE: 0-77-0090-0482. It's seared across my heart. Do you know why Diane changed her name? I didn't know she had. Was she in trouble? Running from someone? Something? I told you I haven't seen her. Natalie, just one more question. Where were you yesterday afternoon? Shopping. RICHARD: Do you have any witnesses? A till receipt? Nothing. I couldn't find anything that fit me. [laughing] [inaudible] Did you get anything on the landlord? Previous tenants said he was a bit creepy. Always around. Hovering, as that one put it. What about the kids she worked with? There were several, but yesterday would have been Fergus Urwin. 12-year-old who had been aroundher flat earlier in the day. Just off to have a chat with him now. Great. Anything else? We sent a laptop off to IT for processing, but they've already noted that Diane went speed dating recently. SHAP: She met 25 men, 18 ofwhom wanted to see her again, and our emails show that she'd agreed to date with three of them. [music playing] I'll do the talking, love. Show you how it's done. Robert Urwin? It's Bob. What's this about? Uh, Bob. Diane Waugh. She looks after your son, Fergus? Mhm. Well, we've been trying to contact her. You know she left Fergus on his own, yesterday? I went round there and knocked. No answer. Wouldn't have been. Had to get Lonely Larry to open up. It's the landlord. That's what Diane called him. So you went into the flatbut you didn't see Diane? No. Called out, there was no answer. I couldn't believe it. What time was it? BOB FERGUS: Five. Usually Fergus would be here with Diane, but it's the builders. He doesn't like the builders. So did you notice anything unusual when you went into the flat? BOB FERGUS: Some litter in the hallway. And Fergus. The poor thing had wet himself. He doesn't like being left alone. Fergus had wet himself? Does he often do that? No. Not unless he becomes distraught. Call the boss. Get her over here. What's going on? There's a reason Diane didn't answer the door. She were dead. Murdered. And I think your son peed himself because he saw it happen. [music playing] BOB FERGUS: Sorry. MATILDA FERGUS: He can't help you. RICHARD: We'd just like toask him a few questions. It doesn't matter. This is a murder inquiry. BOB FERGUS: It doesn't make any difference. Fergus is autistic. He won't communicate. Not about anything. Anything at all. But he'll talk to you. What, nothing? Not ever? MATILDA FERGUS: No. Not a single word. CORONER: I found traces of carrot in the wound. She was chopping carrotsjust before she was killed. CORONER: Ah, that explainsthe murder weapon. Judging from the wound, it's standard issue. Millions of them sold. Knife entered the carotid arteryat an angle of 48 degrees, which suggests a tall attacker. And Diane's how tall? CORONER: 5' 5". Which would make her attacker? Six foot plus. What about time of death? CORONER: Can't be precise. Potassium levels in the eyes suggest we're looking at somewherebetween 1:00 and 5:00 PM. Anything else? CORONER: This is the weird thing. Maybe frightening is the word. There are no defense wounds. Usually you react, lift yourhands to defend yourself. But this was, well, one deadly act. Knife goes in, does the job, they immediately know she's dead. Any signs of sexual activity? Nothing. This was murder at its simplest form. Hey. Hi, man. Oh, by the way, I almost forgot. It's probably nothing, but Idid hear something last week coming from Diana's flat. Yeah, and? She had a visitor. A man. I heard them rowing. It was very heated. Did you see who it was? Sadly, I didn't. I only heard it, you see. If I happen to be in the kitchen, I can sort of hear everything. Any idea what there row were about? That is to say, it was just raised voices. As for his language, well. Did you hear him threaten her? Well, I didn't need to. It was in his voice. Hi, sweetheart. Missing you. [music playing] Only been gone a few days. JANINE: [ON PHONE] Well, Ican still miss you, can't I? Is your dad there? Out. Tina is looking after us. Boss? Darling, would you tell him I phoned? Yeah. Got to go. - Everything all right? - Yeah. Kids are having a great time. RICHARD: Oh, that's great. Listen, I've beenchasing up the ex-fiance. Lives and works inLiverpool, but get this-- last year he had a restriction order placed on him. - Diane Begley? - Spot on. He wasn't allowed within 500 yards of her. Bit of a boy, this one. Right? So she moves down here fromLiverpool, changes her name, settles down to a completely new life. Maybe he finds her again? [music playing] No smoking here, mate. Eh. I'm looking for Will Harmon. Yeah, you found him. So when's the last time you saw Diane Begley? Is that a trick question? Well, I'm sure you know Iwasn't allowed near her. Yeah, what was all that about? We were together three months. She had a lot of nice stuff at her flat. I collect rare 45s. We split up. I wanted my records back, only Diane says that they're her's now. I wasn't going to let them go easy. Next thing I know, she's got called a court order slapped on me. Says I'd been bothering her. Let's go back to the original question. When was the last time you saw Diane? Can't remember. Try. It was months ago. Did you know she changed her name? No, I didn't. What's that got to do with anything? Hrm. We're gonna have to know where you were at the time of the murder. [music playing] What I'm a suspect? Didn't come in to empty out bins, pal. All right, we foundtraces of blood in the hall and on the walls. Now what we can't figure out is, if she was killed in the hallway,why is there so little of it? Now, someone gave this wall a good scrub. You get stabbed in the carotid artery and it hoses out everywhere. Still not enough blood. JANINE: Well, at least weknow one thing for sure. He wasn't kneeling. The killer's tall. God, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting. Thank you very much for coming in. Anything to help. How can we get Fergus to talk? I'm afraid you can't. There must be some way. Believe me, we've tried. Fergus sees no reason tospeak, so therefore, he won't. He's quite happy as he is. I've got a young woman lyingdead in the morgue right now. And you're dealing with a boy who has autistic spectrum disorder. Part of that encompasses a selective mutism. Yeah, you see, the key wordthere for me is selective. It seems to indicate he doesand can talk when he selects to. To him, we're all just objects. No one really communicateswith an object, do they? Mr. Munroe, he is my only witness in a major murder inquiry. I've got to find a way ofgetting him to open up. It's virtually impossible. Fergus might not be able to talk, but maybe he can do other things. Such as? Well, let's find out. Richard? Had lunch yet? Erm-- My treat. I'm a bit busy at the moment, sir. No, no, it's all right. I can handle this on me own. Cheers. Cod nice? It's not bad. Richard, I don't know if I said this or not, but I was very impressed with the work you did while Janine was way. OK. In fact, I've heard that there's a position going with the NCS. And I was wondering if you fancied applying? National Crime Squad? Why not? You proved yourself. Anyway, if you're interested, I'd be only too happy tosupport your application. It may move me away. I know you like it here. Well, I've liked lots of places I've worked. Pity the wife didn't. Sick of the constant uprooting. Can't stay a DI forever, you know. Oh, I don't intend to. HACKETT: And at least this time you won't be leaving anyone beyond. No. [music playing] Fergus? I brought some people to see you. Fergus? Fergus, I've got some photos here. You might have seen one of these people. Can I show you? Do you recognize anyone? He barely recognizes photos of us. MATILDA FERGUS: Yeah. He uses these to help remindhim that we have some bearing of important to him. At least, that's the hope. Hang on. I know him. Richard? I've just had it confirmed-- Will saw Diane only last week. Get in on him. I'm on my way. Hadn't seen her in months, didn't know she changed her name? How many lies are you going to tell us? You disobeyed a court order. I just wanted my records. What you wanted was her. Do me a favor. You chipped your fiance for her. She must have beensomething pretty special. - She was all right. - Oh, come on, Will. She was more than that. You became obsessed withher, so it drove her away. Natalie said you were passionate. Now while sometimes passionis a wonderful thing, it's not great when itgets out of control, is it? You went there more than once, didn't you? Nope. You were there last Fridayand things got out of hand. No. JANINE: Yeah. You lost it with her. Not me. Got a witness. Doesn't matter, because I wasn't there. We were checking your alibi. You say you went out for a swim. Well, no one recognizesanyone in a pool, do they? That's not great, is it? That's your problem. No, no, it's very much your problem. Before I release your client on bail, I want hair and fiber samples. I'm not finished with you yet. [music playing] Should have held on to him, try to crack him. With what? Only person who can placehim there is Fergus. We need more. We need much more. You are the boss. What's that supposed to mean? [cell ringing] Nothing. PETE: [ON PHONE] It's Pete. Hiya. What is it? It's Tina. She wants to marry me. You know, I think the kids have grown on her. And she feels that she has, youknow, been accepted by them. And they won't mind. Oh, did a survey, has she? What should I do? It's not up to me, Pete. But I don't know what to. Well, you think I do? [cell phone rings] Leave it. JANINE: I can't. If you-- Sorry. Richard? [music playing] Will Harmon's been run off the road. An eyewitness said it wasa white or silver car. Looked intentional. Mute number two. Great. Look into every aspect of the last few days. Work backwards, sideways, wherever, but find out where he was atthe time of Diane's murder. What if Diane's killertried to off him as well? I want you to getmoving on this, all right? JANINE: You're OK? Yeah, I am, why? I don't know. You just seem a little-- What? Tense. No. Boss, Diane was killed some time after four. Cheers. Her phone records show she took a call from a double glazing companyabout five past four-ish. Thanks. And she was already dead whenBob called for Fergus at 5:00. Then we're down to maybe a 45 minute window for the time of death?- Yeah? Great.What about the speed daters. I've spoken to two of them. They've both got alibi's that check out. Right. They tell us anything about Diane? Well, the first one's a real charmer. It turns out he's married andhe doesn't want to say anything. But finally he admitted thathe wanted to take it further. But she was reluctant for some reason. Which is where the other one comes in. Said she mentioned an ex, someone she may have split from recently. Hadn't got over him. How recently? Months, weeks, days? Weeks at most. Neither of them saw her again? SHAZ: No. JANINE: What about the third bloke? He's on his way in. We got the impression that Diane had split from someone recently. Yes, she gave that to me as well. She didn't happen to mention a name? No, sorry. Got to ask this to you,but where were you on Friday between four and five PM? - Don't mind me. You've got your job to do. Well, I sell bathroom fittings,drive up and down the country. So it's hard to say exactly where I was. But I think I probably would have been somewhere on thePoet's Estate on that day. Why are you thinking that in particular? Those are retailers thatI go to the first Friday of every month, and that'sthe best way to get there. Anyone see you? There's a chance I might have stopped off for something to eat. But to be honest, my life's one long road. You forget where you are, sometimes. Stab me. Sorry? Stab me. - What with? - It doesn't matter. Just stab me. Yeah, a phone, OK. Nope. Can't spin like that. Blood would have gone everywhere. OK. Try again. No, that's not right. Um. Yeah, OK, come here. Come here. Yeah, OK, stab me there. Yeah, take the knife out. [music playing] That's our first splash of blood. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So she falls against you-- yeah, you stagger. Stagger back. Yeah, right into here. Yeah. That's where the blood's gone. Yeah. Soaking into the killer's chest. Yeah. Locks down her legs, dumped her here. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. You can stop hugging me now. All right. How did the killer get out? He's covered in blood and yet nobody sees him. It's unlikely. I'm guessing he didn't go very far. Where does that landlord live? Talk us through when you firstlet yourself into Diane's flat. Walked in, looked around-- um, what did I do? There was litter. Yeah, Fergus's dad said something about litter. Wasn't any when we were around. Yeah, I tied it up. I like a tidy man. I popped it in the wastebasket. Ever the helpful landlord. There wasn't a bag, though. Usually there's a plastic bag that prevents the basket from gettingdirty, but there wasn't one. Hang on. The killer's covered inblood, they were in a coat or a jacket of some kind. They need to get rid ofit and the murder weapon. This is the first bag they come across. They're in a hurry, they empty it out, they put the murder weaponand the jacket inside the bag. RICHARD: Bingo. Yeah, does it for me. RICHARD: I was thinking, if it wasn't Will-- Well, we can't see on that yet. Just go with me on this one. Yeah, all right, don't snap. RICHARD: I'm not. Let's assume there's a mystery man, someone else she split from. Who? Landlord. [laughing] What, Larry? He's no mystery lover. Why not? Well, have you seen him? He's lonely for a very good reason. Hello. [music playing] Girl like Diane wouldn'ttouch him with a barge pole. Doesn't mean to say he didn't kill her. Will didn't do it. Somebody else must have. Tenner says Larry did it. Yeah, all right, you're on. Let's get him in. This is one of Diane's previous boyfriends, and we wondered if you might have seen him. LARRY: No, no, I've never seen him. To be honest with you, it'sonly if I'm in my kitchen that I hear anything. Spend a lot of time in the kitchen? no more than most. We know she's seeing someone. Come on, Larry. We know he was tall. He was about your height, in fact. My height? RICHARD: Did she go for tall men? Well. RICHARD: What? What, Larry? LARRY: I-- RICHARD: Yeah? LARRY: I-- RICHARD: I think we all know. Do we? It was you, wasn't it? Me? RICHARD: You were seeing her. You were her mystery man, secret lover. Was I? Come on. You know you want to tell us. Yes. Yes, it was me. She and I, we had a relationship. RICHARD: Why not tell us this before? I just found my fiance dead. I'm-- in shock. Your fiance? I didn't see an engagement ring. Well, we we're going to buy it this weekend, throw a little party. We heard she just split fromsomeone, started speed dating. It was just a little hiccup. One of those things couples will go through. She was-- we'd be soon back together. So who was going to cometo this engagement party? Oh, you know, the usual suspects. JANINE: Oh, people like her sister? Of course. Well, top of the list. [knock on door] JANINE: Yeah? We've had a good look at the car. JANINE: Thanks. Hello, again. Hi. Are you really so lonely, you have to pretend to have arelationship with a dead woman. Pardon me? You don't even know thatshe fell out with her sister eight months ago. I did. We were going to use the engagement to-- To, to what? Get them back together? LARRY: That's right. Yeah, you're wasting our time. I'm not. Car's clean. Not a mark or scratch on it. - We're looking for a murderer.- We were in love. JANINE: Oh, go home, Larry. Take a bit of advice and stoploitering in the kitchen. Get out there. The world's not going to come knocking. You have to go and find it. Go on. Never bet against female intuition. So where does that leave us, then? The sister? No, I can't see it. Why wait eight months for your revenge? What kind of car does this guy drive? A Mondeo Silver. Got anything on him? SHAP: I just pulled up anincident when he was 16. He tucked a female teacher. Nothing else since. Boss. Checked the ex-fiance's bank statements. He made a transaction at this bank about a minute away from the swimmingpool he claimed he went to. CCTV photo and timecode provehe couldn't have murdered Diane. I'm impressed. Thanks. Taught her everything she knows, boss. Guess who's back in town tomorrow night? BUTCHER: We had a quiet word andgot access to the guest list. Tim's on it. JANINE: Speed dating? What's his alibi for the murder? We're still working on it. Boss? I was just thinking, conventional questioning didn't give us anything. Maybe we need to catch him out another way. Right? I could meet him at the speed dating. Get to know him. No, I don't like it. Forget it. Hang on. It's my call. RICHARD: I was justgiving you my take on it. JANINE: So I heard. I need to talk to Hackett. [toilet flushing] Sorry, I'm already spoken for. Heh, yeah. I want to set up a covert operation, sir. Our number one suspect is going to be there. I want to be there, as well. You're not suggesting entrapment, are you? No, no, no, no. I just want to get to know him. He's got form. He travels the country anonymously. He could be up to all sorts. Right. If that's what you think it's going to take. Sir? Richard has been a bitpreoccupied since your lunch. Hm. You'd have to ask him about that. [music playing] JANINE: There's a boy in thathouse who saw everything. Just one name. That's all it'd take. Something's up. What aren't you telling me? Am I losing you? Nothing's set in stone. Oh, great. Any news? No. How's Fergus? Fergus is Fergus. We're thinking of tryingto talk to him again. Have you got your man? No. Ah. Best get off to work. I don't think you'll find any answers here. [music playing] JANINE: Another silver car. RICHARD: Most popular color. Read it somewhere. JANINE: He heard me tellingyou to bring Will in! Back up. RICHARD: What? [music playing] JANINE: Back up now! What the hell? What's going on? I think I know what you bumped into. Forensics have matched thepaint on your car to Will's. Your wife told us you were out the night he was run off the road. To explain the dent, you said someone had backed into your car. Now which of those statementsdo you think we don't buy? Trying to kill someone is a pretty extreme reaction, considering she's just a girl who looked after your kid. JANINE: I mean, what ifshe meant something to you? I don't know, like-- like a lover, let's say? God, it must have been hard, bottling it up. Especially when you heard she was dead. You didn't crinkle. I think if it had beenme, I'd have fallen apart. We know that was a man in her life. I thought Will had killed her. I went into this blind rage. He wouldn't leave her alone. He was infatuated. Tell us about you and Diane. How'd you get together? We fell in love. That's it. No great mystery to it. No clap of thunder. Just fell in love. All right. So if you were in love,why were she speed dating? I'd ended it. I think she was trying to make me jealous. Oh. So much for love. BOB FERGUS: I still loved her. It was wrong, though. It's not fair on Matilda. You have no idea what it'slike living with Fergus. You-- you have a babytogether, it's the very best moment any couple can have. You look down at him and you wait for his smile. Only it doesn't come. We hold up toys and make funny noises. We grin until our teethhurt, and he does nothing. 12 years, we've been waiting for that smile. Friends tend to keep their distance because they think he's difficult. Relatives phone rather than visit. And then Diane came aroundand started looking after him, and she was so different. She was so welcoming, caring, patient. And after a while I saw a wayout, an escape route, with her. Will you tell Matilda? It'll come out anyway. JANINE: You might be gone to prison, Bob. You're sure Will didn't kill Diane? Yeah, we're positive. You know the real reason I ended it? Was I couldn't leave Matildaon her own with Fergus. Hard enough with the two ofus trying to cope with him, but I couldn't do that to her. Couldn't leave her with nothing. [radio static] Where's Bob? Matilda, we're holding himon an attempted murder charge. He's never done anythingwrong in his life. [music playing] Right, cards on the table, what we got? One unknown killer andone known attempted killer. Bob could be both. And then there's the wife, Matilda. Hell hath no fury and all that. Till you realize she's only5'1" and in no way tall enough. Which brings us to Tim, the sales rep. Or Operation Lonelyheart,as I like to call it. JANINE: Are you sure you want to do this, Vicki? Yeah, absolutely. Do you reckon he'll go for me? Listen, I hope youdon't mind me pitching in, but I really do think someoneshould be in there with her. JANINE: There will be. You. You never know. Might meet the woman of your dreams. [MUSIC - NINA SIMONE, "THE LOOK OF LOVE"] MUSIC: The look of love is in your eyes. The look your heart can't disguise. [bell ringing] Here we go. [music playing] Hi, I'm Vicki. Tim. Hi, I'm Richard. VICKI: [OVER MIC] Excuse the nerves. It's my first time. TIM: [OVER MIC] Same here. Someone's lying. TIM: [OVER MIC] I can't believe you're single. I wasn't-- until a few weeks ago. I thought I'd met the man of my dreams. Hey, see these shoulders of mine? They're yours. If you want someone to lean on, lean on me. Could you arrest someonefor using lines like that? [laughs] - You're very direct. TIM: Well, you got five minutes. Why waste time? Only-- I think we've got something going on here. I'm on the rebound. Little vulnerable. - Prey. VICKI: Sorry? Prey? TIM: [OVER MIC] To these men in here. You are. They'll see that. Take advantage of you, if they can. And you won't? No. [bell ringing] We were just getting somewhere. TIM: [OVER MIC] Nice to meet you. VICKI: [OVER MIC] That's it? TIM: [OVER MIC] Well, hopefully not. But you never know in these situations. Listen. What's she playing? Let's get out of here. [music playing] What? I never taught her that. VICKI: [OVER MIC] I thinkI need to be saved, Tim. Stick to the plan, girl. Just make another dateand leave the rest to us. Should we, er, make a move? Stupid, stupid girl. I love cities. I love being anonymous. I can walk around and do anything I like. What sort of things would they be? That'd be telling. VICKI: [OVER MIC] I have to say,I'm surprised you're single. TIM: [OVER MIC] That's theonly downside to a city. Teeming with people, yetno one wants to meet you. VICKI: [OVER MIC] No one? TIM: [OVER MIC] Well,there was a girl recently. Nice girl, but she hadthis thing about this guy. Why didn't she wait? TIM: [OVER MIC] Claimed he broke her heart. I offered to mend it, put it back together, but did she want to? No. Turned me down. Said she had this big idea toget him back, to make him her's again. Tell all, she said. [cell phone rings] You're really pretty. Thanks. Bit thick, though. Sorry? I mean, coming down here in the dark with a complete stranger? Well, that's just asking for trouble. Get off me! I'm arresting you! No you're not, you're not! Butcher's rang. He's not our man. That was one of the moststupid things I've ever seen. It was irresponsible, it was dangerous, and it wasn't part of the plan. I thought it was him. We are a team! We have our roles and we stick to them. I'm sorry. Sorry. That's a great word, that sorry. Might make you feel better. It doesn't help me any. Tim claimed that it wasdriving down the Poet's Estate, but that's speed bump hell. So what you do is you take ashort cut down Blackhorse Lane. Now guess what's on Blackhorse Lane? Black horses, eh? Mervin The Moose. It's one of them family pubs. They're running a specialat the moment for the kids. Get a balloon and your photograph taken with Mervin The Moose. Is this leading somewhere? SHAZ: The photos are digital. They get dumped onto a hard disk and then emailed to the families. And we took a copy of the day in question. Now it took somescrutinizing, but at the time Diane was being murdered, Tim was having his photograph taken. That's him there in the background. SHAP: Right we are. Good work, lads. What do I do with this? Just drop it off on your way out, love. Hang on. TIM: [RECORDED] She hadthis thing about this guy. Claimed he broke her heart. I offered to amend it, put it back together, but did she want to know? Turned me down. Said she had this big idea to get him back. Diane wanted Bob back. She had a plan. She threatened to tell his wife about them. What she didn't realize was, Bob couldn't destroy Matilda like that. Just couldn't do it to her. Maybe Diane told Bob what she was planning. Threatened him. Gave him an ultimatum. So he goes ballistic. This is a man who got angry enough to run Will off the road. Why would he try and killher ex-boyfriend as well? Because he's clever. How do you mean? We're about to find outhe's having an affair, right? So he thinks, why don't I go after Will, make it look like revenge? Then no one will think that I murdered Diane. Well, you're rightly on a roll now, mate. Yeah, it's possible. It's calculated enough. Very cool. [music playing] Maybe that was it all along. Murder in it's simplest form. One strike, one dead woman. Hey. [inaudible] OFFICER: Boss! Nothing in his car, but we got a murder weapon. Forensics is checking it now. Oh, great. Time to get the shift on. Already have. So, where's this new job gonna take you? London, East End. Oh. How's your rhyme and slang? At Butcher's. As in Butcher's and Shap? Eh, sounds like we've just about wrapped this one up, then. That's teamwork for you, sir. [knock on door] You're not going to like this, boss. They managed to get someprints off the murder weapon. And? They're not Bob's. Whose, then? They don't know. It's got to be in. He's got the motive, he's tall enough. Why don't you have another crack in him? With what? What about the wife? Go around there, rattle thecage, see what falls out. [phone rings] Hello? Eh, it's worth a shot. Do it first thing tomorrow. OK, send him up. I'll tell her. RICHARD: Pete's on his way up. He wants to see you. Oh, great. Probably wants to serve me with divorce papers. Listen, I've got to and see Hackett. He wants to buy me a drink.- Oh, right? Is it time to start at a whip-round? It's still up in the air. Richard? Hm? JANINE: It's time you were moved up. You're a good cop. [music playing] Hi. Hi. Oh, you smell nice. Tina bought me here. I've been thinking. Maybe I've been rushing things.About the divorce? Well you got to do it sometime. I know. But just don't want to do it now. Don't feel right, somehow. And I was thinking more aboutthe kids, how it'd effect them, and-- because I got carried away,I think I forgot about them. They won't like it. Not just out of the blue like this. They're kids. It's always the kids. JANINE: Fergus, was this personthere when Diane got hurt? This person? Actually, it doesn'treally matter what he says, does it, Matilda? When did you found out about the affair? The other week. Bob's mobile phone gave it away. He'd been ringing her everyday for the last three months, practically. So you went over there. Yeah. When I finally workedout what I wanted to say. Did she tell you it was over? No. Far from it. That's a shame. Because it was. Really? Yeah, Bob had finished it. But Diane said-- well, she stood there andtold me that he was hers now, that my husband was hers. She said that to my face. Can you imagine hearing that? [music playing] I was calm. Didn't raise my voice. I've learned patience,especially with having Fergus. I was quite proud of myself. I told her that she couldn't have Bob. How'd she find that? She didn't have mycontrol, that's for sure. Did she push you? Hard? Does it matter? She virtually attacked me. I mean, with all thethings she'd been saying, how I might as well put an adin the Lonelyhearts column, I should have taken bettercare of myself, given Bob more. I finally lost it. I saw the knife, grabbed it,and the next thing I knew, I'd stabbed her with it. She fell forward onto me, blood all over me. Coats upstairs. You'll find something on it. I've washed it, but there'llbe something there, I'm sure. You staggered back with her. Into the loo. The door was open, so I pushed her in there. I looked down at my coat,and it was covered in blood. I thought, how could Igo out with it like that? And I couldn't find a bag anywhere. And I noticed the bin in the hall. I can't believe you left Fergus there. I had to. Alone, though? Well, what else could I do? At least he wouldn't see her. And Bob would be coming back soon enough, so. Look, I'm not proud of what I've done, but you've got to understand itwas in the heat of the moment. And those things she said, they hurt. They really hurt. You might as well arrest me. I'm not gonna put up afight or make a run for it. I'm not that type. Yeah. Yeah, that practically matcheswhat forensics say happened. They go there. I'm guilty. There's just one of twothings still bothering me. The wound in her neck, coupled with the arterial spray, means she must have been facing you. That's right. Yeah. Only we didn't find any defense wounds. I mean, someone comes at you with a knife, up go the hands every time. I was quick. I surprised her. Even so, you're not tall enough. What? She was bending down. No, no, Matilda, weknow she was standing up. I must've jumped up. What, stabbed her? Yeah. With your right hand? Because from the way she was facing, it must have been your right hand. And that's what happened. Yeah, but thefingerprints on the knife are from the left hand. - Well, there you go. I'm left handed. You're not listening to me. Diane's attacker used their right hand. Yeah, well that's what must have happened. I mean, it was all a blur. I just picked up a knife and-- who cares what hand I used? Well, I care, as it happens. Because, um, you didn'tstab her with either hand did you, Matilda? Look, I killed her and that's that. Who else was with you? [music playing] No one. There was someone, wasn't there? Please just take my word for it. I killed Diane. This is what happened, Matilda, OK? This is what really happened. Diane was shouting at you. You stay calm. I mean, you said yourselfyou don't lose it easily, but my guess is she was really going for you. She raised her voice enough to bring Fergus to the top of the stars. And he sees his mom beingpushed around and gets agitated. So much so that he wets himself. Now we thought it was because hesaw the murder, but it wasn't. It was because he sawDiane having a go at you, saying that she was goingto take Bob away from you. So he comes halfway down thestairs and he sees the knife. He's level with her neck, he sees you crying, and the next thing you know he's driven the knife into her. No. She never saw it coming, nor did you. You managed to get her into the toilet. Pick up the knife, you wipe it clean. But when you shove it into thebag, you use your left hand. Hence the prints. They're not Fergus's. Yours. Did you do that on purpose? Mm, no. To protect him? Because when it all came out,we could only ever blame you? No. [crying] At the end of the day, wealways think of the kids. You've got it all wrong. Fergus doesn't react like that. He doesn't have any feelings. He doesn't recognize me. He doesn't even know howto smile at his own mother. So for him to know I was introuble and want to defend me, it's impossible. It-- it would be like admittingthat there is something there, and that we do have a bond, and that somehow he really loves me. And that can't be. But he does know who you are. You're his mom. [music playing] And he loves you. Matilda's confession can easily be disproved. It will never stand up, not for a second, and she'll never admit that Fergus did it. She'll cover and cover for him. The only person that knows the truth, Fergus, well, he can't tell us anything. And anyway, he doesn't evenknow he's done anything wrong. Well done, boss. Great result. Depends which way you look at it. RICHARD: How did you work it out? I was sure it was Bob. Oh, I can't give you all the secrets. You'll be after my job next. So what are we going to do now? We? Yeah, I'm not going anywhere. Let somebody else apply for that job. Hackett wasn't too pleased. Made me pay for all the drinks. Oh, well. Maybe next time. Maybe. We get all the finds off to CPS? Better than a prosecutor. Burger? I can't. I'm washing my hair. So that's it, then? Not so much as a welcome back? Why? You never went away. [music playing]
