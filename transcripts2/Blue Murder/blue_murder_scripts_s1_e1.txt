 Oh, I know, it's a kangaroo. It's not a kangaroo, it's me: Tom! (SHRIEKS) A sabre-toothed tiger.(GROWLS) Take it off while you have your breakfast, Eleanor. Why? It'll get soggy. Ooh, thank you. Michael, breakfast! An alien world. What makes wind? Beans. Phrrrt! (TUNES RADIO) Lunch box. Lunch box. Oww! Get dressed. Oh, great (!) Are you itchy?

 Oh, you've missed 'em, Janine. What time do you call this? Oh, Sarah, not again! I put yours out for you. Oh, thanks. Oh, why me? What do they do with them? Anarchy, chaos, meltdown. I'd report it, if I were you. That man at the town hall had a very nice phone manner. Oh, desperate. (GIGGLES) It's my go. It's not fair. Eleanor, come on. Michael, let her have a go. Mum, come and look at what I made upstairs. (PHONE RINGS) Phone! Look what I made upstairs. Michael? I've only just started. She's only a little girl. Let her have a go. He's lying. Michael. Hello. You're the Lemon, aren't you? Mum, it's the Lemon. Mr Hackett. Sir? Oh, Tom, inhaler. Good boy. Michael, come on...now. Can't we go to Dad's? Dad's not in. I'm sorry, I don't know for how long. The clinic told your dad it could be a year before they can see him. Mum, I'm sorry. If we have to, we'll go private, never mind the money. I'll give you a ring later. Give him my love. All right. Yeah? Sir? Lawson's on long-term sick. O'Halloran's got the airport thing and Cragg's got annual leave. He reckons his missus will walk out if he cancels. New Zealand, sir. They've family there. So I thought I'd give you a crack of the whip. Right, what is it? Right. Gorton Avenue. Allotments off Mauldeth Road West. Man found there by one of the other gardeners. We're treating it as suspicious. You can set up an incident room here, it's near enough. Dr Balloran's on his way and so are SOCO. Not quite sure who'll assist us yet. Right. Janine, I'd like you to report to me on this. So if you get any concerns, queries or cockups, you just bring 'em straight to me. Is that OK?OK. (Control-alt-delete, sir, it's the only way out.) Yes. Got you. Morning, Constable. DCI Lewis. Morning. Morning, ma'am. Right. It's just down the end there. Thanks. Morning, gents. From the beginning, constable. Nice and slow. I was on Mauldeth Road West when I heard the dispatch. I got here and a Mr Simon said there was a body, a Mr Matthew Tulley - he knew him - on the allotment, so I come down to have a look and check him for signs of life but there weren't none. Did you touch anything else? Only the body - the deceased - his neck and his back, when I was checking him, like. Right. Thanks. Chief Inspector Lewis. Is this your baby? Yeah, you could say that. WOMAN: No! No! Is this going to help?! No! Please. No more. Stop! Paula, look, um... I've had to go away for a bit. I'll er... I'll talk to you later. I love you, Paula. No visible sign of injury on the back. Doc's finishing off. We think we've got a shoe print. Went to wash his hands? Mr Tulley? Grassmere? Different tread. Excuse me. Richard. Hello, stranger. What are you doing on my patch? Whatever you say, boss. I'm at your service. I didn't even know you were back. First day. Never really felt at home down South.Different planet. Realised what you were missing? Summat like that. Come and see what we've got. On three. One, two, three. That's nasty. Very nasty. Thank God I skipped breakfast. There's blood spray on the wall, either side of the door and the floor here. We'll try for prints on the door frame, the gate, the door. The tap and the water were over there. Rough wood? Yeah. Not promising anything. Probably a knife. Oh, well spotted, Sherlock (!) Bereavement officer? She's on her way. Oh, I hate this bit. Having to break the news? Forked tongue, weighing them up. What's real grief supposed to look like, anyway? You do it very well, as I remember. Teacher. Deputy Head, St Columbus High. Wife Lesley, no kids. Not much else yet. Random attack?Or somebody who knew him, knew the allotment. I think we can rule out aggravated burglary. Someone after his mower doesn't quite cut it. Maybe not at home, at school. Trouble in the staff room. Mmm. Well, you've finally got it. Senior officer in charge. The Lemon didn't like it. Hackett. Suits him, don't you think? Still getting over my promotion to Chief Inspector. But we're shorthanded and he's being leaned on to meet minority targets and, despite my size, I'm a minority. And O'Halloran's still hanging on. Bully boy? Too right. Lemon won't touch him. I er - I heard, you and Pete... Tina. Latest home help. Helped herself all right. Did you know you were pregnant? Oh, yeah. Both been in deep shock for a few weeks already. Our first weekend alone, Barcelona - our 16th anniversary. Big romantic gesture, all a decoy. He was sleeping with her way back. Bastard. Anyway, too much rioja and, bingo, a special souvenir. I'd have settled for a pair of castanets. How are the kids? Tom's six. You're joking. It's been rough on them. Pete's still on air traffic control, shifts. They hardly see him some weeks. They miss him. And you? Oh, good days, bad days. It's not been long. I gave him a second chance, with the baby and all. But he moved in with her. What about you? Single. You and Wendy? Let's do it. Douggie, mate, where the hell have you been? And I love you too, Dean (!) You were switched off. It's the mobi' I got off the market. It only works half the time. Anyway, how's Manchester? Not good. Look, can you put us up for a bit? No problem. You wanna get yourself on the M60 - No wheels.Starter motor's gone. I'm in Oldham now. Where are you from the coach station? Mrs Tulley? Yes? I'm Detective Chief Inspector Lewis. This is Detective Inspector Mayne. Greater Manchester Police CID. Can we come in? Erm, of course. It's about your husband Matthew Tulley. Matthew? What about him? Please, Mrs Tulley, sit down. What's happened? Is he all right? It's bad news, I'm afraid. Oh, my God. Has there been an accident? I'm really sorry, Mrs Tulley. I'm very sorry to have to tell you... ..Matthew's dead. No. Oh, God. Oh, please, no. What happened? We're not sure at the moment... ..but we are treating his death as suspicious. Someone hurt him?We believe some sort of weapon was used. Is there someone you could call? Someone who could be with you? My erm...my sister Emma. We'll ring Emma in a minute. Any other family? His parents? They're both dead. There isn't anybody. We...will need a relative to identify him. If you don't feel able to - I'll do it. I want to see him. It's just a formality. We're sure it's Matthew. I'm sorry. I realise this is an awful, terrible shock. But I do need to ask you one or two questions. Can we get you a cup of tea? Just tell me if you need to stop at any time. Yo, Dean. All right, Douggie mate? Yeah, not bad. Are you all right? Gary, this is Dean what I told you about.All right. All right, mate. So what's the story? Look, me being here, it's just a friendly visit, right? No trouble. So not a word, OK? Yeah, all right. Are you all right, mate?I could do with some grub, something to drink. Got owt in? Tea, toast? I was thinking more like a few cans and a takeaway. But it can be arranged. When did you last see Matthew? This morning. He went off to the allotment. And what time was this? About nine, I think. And was that usual for a Saturday morning? Can you think of anyone who had a grudge against Matthew? Anything like that? (DOORBELL RINGS) I'll get it. Can you tell us any more? No comment. Thank you. Are there any suspects yet? Would it be possible...? Keep all your curtains closed, Lesley. Use your answer phone. Don't talk to the press. It's important they only use the information we release to them. OK? (MOBILE RINGS) Sorry. Has he complained? I can't tell how long I'll be. Mum, will you ring me if he gets any worse? Hello, Ellie. Well, just have fruit. No, she's not mean. She j... Look, I'll see you later. No, not the middle of the night. It would help if we had a recent photo of Matthew. School. Thanks. We'll need to take Matthew's diaries, check his recent E-mails. The money? Business is good. Gary and me, nice little number. It's no sweat. Anyway, you like a line as much as the next man. If you fancy earning some cash - No, Douggie. I've got to go to Manchester - Leave it. I'm not interested. What's going on? Emma. She didn't even ask where he was found. Neither of us mentioned the allotment. She knew that was where he was going. Yeah, but he could've been attacked en route. It's a rough area, more people about. REPORTER: Mrs Tulley, can I ask you a few questions? What do you make of her? How do you feel? Mrs Tulley...? Just with the cheese on, please. Cool. 45 minutes. Cool. Ta-rah. Thank you. 50p total? Richard, our Eleanor's sponsored skip. It's for a good cause. She'll do the lot, you know. A serious skipper. Right. Afternoon, everyone. Afternoon, boss. DS Shap, Butchers. All right. DI Richard Mayne, back from far-flung parts. He'll be my second in command. DC Chen. And Miss... ..Grassmere. ..from Forensics. Good to see you all. Right, what have we got? Victim: Matthew Tulley. Aged 42. Deputy head, St Columbus Roman Catholic High School in Whalley Range. Wife: Lesley Tulley, aged 28. Both live at Ashgrove, Barnes Lane. Last alleged sighting of Mr Tulley at home this morning, 9:00am. He left Mrs Tulley to go to his allotment. Deceased discovered and reported at 11:00am by Mr Simon, who has the adjoining plot. Where are the scene of crime shots? They're on the way. Printer's playing up. White heat of technology, eh (?) OK. Mr Tulley was found prostrate. Legs in the shed, head and torso out. We're waiting for confirmation of the murder weapon - some sort of knife. We heard it were a ritual killing, boss, that he were disembowelled. Bollocks. No, they were intact actually. The wound was large enough to release the intestine. I'm off tripe for the duration. What am I gonna do? I'm not going down again, Douggie. No way. It'd kill my mam. And Paula - Eh. Just come here, will you? (SOBS) It'll be all right. DS Shap and Butchers, stay on house to house. Back here tomorrow morning 8:00am sharp. 8:00am? I could make it earlier. Friends and associates, Inspector Mayne? Appointment in the morning with the headmaster.Good. We'll be getting a list from Mrs Tulley, establishing her movements. No known suspects at this point. Death, in all its glory (!) The Trafford Centre? Michael, I'm at work. Why can't you get the bus or try your dad? Y... Hello? Hello? (Seem to think their father's incapable.) Chief Inspector. These actions - Forensics alone are gonna wipe out the budget. I'm not even gonna talk about the overtime. You can't slap it all on a credit card either. Cut 30%, thank you. No bread left, Annie? No. Night-night. Thanks. Bye. Fancy a drink? I can't. Kids. Well, maybe we can go for a bite to eat some time. Yeah. Tomorrow. Well, depending on... Yeah, I'd like that. I'll er... What are you doing here? Someone's got to pick up the pieces. Oh, God. Are you all right? Why didn't you say? Mum, he was mugged. They tried to get his phone, Mum. You were busy. Come on. Coat. When are we going home? What happened? They tried to get his phone and they duffed him up. You should've just given them it. I was going to, then they just ran off. (MIMICS GUNFIRE) You should've rung me. My special gun. What's your name? Tom. What did the police say? Michael? Michael - I don't want to. Ooh! Killer. Love the fangs. Will Dad help pick the name for the baby? Erm...probably. Divine. Needs a bit more blood on the fangs, don't you think? Bad time? Depends. If you were to come bearing gifts... Red or white? Other children bring home gerbils, hamsters. 11. When I grow up, I'll invent a death ray for nits. One zap and they're dead. We'll be dead rich and you'll never have to work at the weekend. Sarah's got them too. The whole school's got 'em. Not just you kids. Occupational hazard. Staff room stinks of tea tree. (CHUCKLES) Done. Oh, and remember the present for Chloe.Yeah. It's me. I have to drop them early. No. No, she had them today. They want to see you, Pete. (God knows why.) Yeah. It'll be about half seven. Bye. I felt so flamin' helpless. And he won't report it. I kept thinking, if only I'd realised. If only I'd been home. If only you weren't such an awful mother (!) I'm a Detective Chief Inspector, leading a bloody murder inquiry and I can't protect my own kids. Can't even keep up with the shopping? Not baking your own bread (?) Seriously though, how do we all keep going? What's the alternative? And work? Murder. See the news? No. They didn't give details, but you know the saying hung, drawn and quartered? well, this bloke had been drawn. Enough to give anyone morning sickness. Janine, God! However, there is good news too. Well, I think it's good. Richard? Richard? Richard Mayne, DI. We were probationers together. I mentioned him to you ages ago. He transferred down South when Tom was little. He's back assisting me and he is seriously sexy. Mmm! Lovely eyes. Nice hands. Nice lips. Gorgeous lips, actually, really. Really. He's a good bloke too. You fancied him before? Oh, yes. Mmm.We were away on a training course together. Got as far as the bedroom, but I changed my mind. Pete and I were engaged. I left Richard all hot and bothered. You're blushing. Hormones. But there was something. That... But I realised too late. And I'd already said yes to Pete. Look where it's got me. Second time lucky. I don't think so. Although he has asked me out for a bite to eat, whatever that means. I think he was gonna book somewhere, but he sort of trailed off. This habit he has of not finishing his sentences. Must have missed that bit of literacy hour. Do you think he's interested? In me?Mmm. Oh, get a grip, Sarah. Bit of flirting, I reckon. Good for the soul. Besides, first shot at senior officer in charge of a rather gory murder, several months pregnant, romance isn't exactly on the agenda. Oh, here we go. Hello, welcome to the programme. First today, the body of deputy head teacher Matthew Tulley, aged 42, was found in allotments... Oh, my God. Do you know him? Know of him. Police cordoned off the area and... Through the union. He was disciplined for hitting a pupil. Then, last year, the lad he assaulted came back to the school and stabbed him in the playground. Sarah? Mm? Do you remember the boy's name? Yeah, Ferdie Gibson. Became a sort of shorthand for dangerous pupils. Anyone like that, we'd call it "having a Ferdie in the form." (PHONE BEEPS) What? First solid lead. You, lady. I'm buying you a new bin. Mummy! Jesus! Get dressed. And get your inhaler. And get Eleanor. Michael, if aliens had landed in the middle of the night and stocked the fridge, I think we'd have heard them. At least they'll feed us. I don't know what time I'll finish. Tom's a bit chesty. I think he'll be all right, but keep an eye on him. Daddy! Oh, and Eleanor's gone completely veggie now. Well, what on earth do I give her? Right. Ferdie Gibson. Why didn't we know about the stabbing yesterday? It's not on file, boss. It was never reported. Still have 9:00am as the last sighting. Witnesses got Matthew Tulley on his bike between his house and the allotments. All house to house accounted for by the end of today. Press camped outside the Tulley's house at present. They love a high-profile case like this - professional man, well known locally. We've an officer there, keeping an eye on things. One thing is puzzling me. Why didn't Lesley Tulley tell us about Ferdie Gibson? Shock. Husband's been killed. We ask if anyone's got a grudge. I mean, you'd mention it in passing, wouldn't you? If nothing emerges in the next 24 hours, Lesley Tulley's gonna make an appeal for information. Postmortem? Death due to a massive haemorrhage from the woundto the abdomen. Defensive cut on his right arm. Time of death between nine and 11. Also, the victim's fingers were clean. No compost or plant material under the nail. Not much of a fight, then? He'd not done much gardening. He died sooner rather than later. Dr Balloran concludes that the weapon was a sharp knife with a slightly curved blade. All-purpose type used by fishermen, gardeners, murderers... Thank you. Sorry, boss. Five inch blade. The attacker was right-handed. The victim was in good health and the report refers to a recent scar on his upper chest. Ferdie Gibson carving his initials, Miss Grassmere? Dabs still being processed. We've got a decent one on the tap. The trainer print here, by the water butt, right foot, somewhere between a 10 and a 12, from the look of it. Small tear on the outside heel and two puncture marks on the ball of the foot. The sort of thing that a drawing pin leaves. It's a dream. Lab's getting us t'make and model. Butchers, best eliminate Mr Simon first on the scene, before we go checking people's shoes. Right, back at five o'clock. Let's fill this wall. We'd like a word with your son, Mrs Gibson. What for? In connection with the murder of Matthew Tulley. Is Ferdinand in?He's got nowt to do wi' that. That's harassment. That man assaulted Ferdie. He's a disgrace. Deputy head and he's lamming into t'kids. Then Ferdie knifed him. Can't prove that. It never went to court. We need to talk to him. We could have a few words with him now or come back with a warrant. Go and get your warrant, then. Quarter of an hour here, 24 down the nick. I still don't know all the ins and outs. Michael's pretty shaken up. He's got a right shiner. We're investigating the murder of Matthew Tulley. I'll be wanting a brief, then. Oh, just an informal chat, Ferdie. Where were you between the hours of nine and 11 yesterday morning? I was here, in bed. Isn't that right, Mam? He never gets up in the morning. You were here all the time? I had my shopping to do, but he were in bed. Till when? Dunno. About one. Called for a mate, then we went to the boozer. Your watch not work? I didn't know it mattered. When was the last time you saw Matthew Tully? Months back. He punched me in the head, you know. Affects my concentration. I get panic attacks. Do you still carry a knife? It's illegal, innit? You used one on Mr Tulley. Never charged. This mate you called for, what's his name? Colin. Where does Colin live? Butchers, I want this Colin checked out now before anyone gets on their sweaty little mobile to warn him. Spitting distance, boss. I'm on my way. Mam, can we go to Nana's? I don't think so. Please. Can I go, then? Please. I can go on my own. You're not going on your own. It's not safe. You could put me on the bus. I don't even think we've got the bus fare, Jade. We could walk. Please, Mam. Please. Jade! Yeah. Yeah, Ferdie, I know what to say. I was there all morning and you came round at one. Yeah, I'll tell 'em. Colin? Detective Sergeant Butchers. Have you got a minute? Is the kettle on? Only got coffee. Two sugars, ta. Are you here on your own? Yesterday morning? What? Where were you, Colin? Here. Really. Ferdinand Gibson, a mate of yours, or so he says - What?What do you know about Ferdinand Gibson and that school teacher that's been killed? Nothing. Well, Ferdie had a go, but that was ages back. Good mate is he, Ferdie? Yeah, sort of. At the moment, he appears to be relying on you to back up his story. Did you see him yesterday? No. Yeah. I mean... Or do you need Ferdie to remind you what's what? You're not cut out for this, are you, son? Stress. It's a killer, you know. We can deal with Ferdie. You can help us out. Frozen peas. Sweet corn. (MOBILE RINGS) Sauce... Colin was in bed till one, when Ferdie called. They watched the match at the Parkway. And there's something else, boss. He was scared witless. He nearly did a runner when he opened the door and saw me. He's got something to hide. Check out his form. I'll get Jenny Chen to sort out obbos on Ferdie Gibson this end. Where have you been? Church: it's Sunday, isn't it (?) I've have thought you'd have cracked it by now.You've had your hair cut. Here, cop this. I'm going to t'shop. Get us a bar, then. Ferdie Gibson: what do you reckon? He's edgy. Alibi's a bit flaky, to say the least. If it was planned, he'd have come up with a better alibi. Then again, not the brightest button in the box, is he? Maybe it was opportunistic. Runs into Tulley, sees his chance, flips, ropes his mate Colin in to try to give him some cover. Give us a biscuit. All gone. They know something. They can't. Not unless you've put ideas in their head. I didn't. I swear. What if they come back? Colin, just stick to the story and everything'll be sweet. You don't know nothing, right? Still no joy? That's his car. Anywhere he might be staying? He's got a girlfriend. Black girl. Paula. They go to her place. She'll know Mr Tulley, she went to t'school. Do you know where she lives? No, but she works in town. One of them bars. Hang on... Steal, they call it. If you see Dean Hendrix, will you ask him to give us a call? DS Shap. Terrible. They say his insides are all spread out, like some voodoo thing. Headmaster. Arthritis, I'm afraid. Comes to us all. Yeah, my father's got it. Well, come along in. Terrible news. What can you tell us about Matthew? Bright, articulate, efficient. Had to be. We have an old tradition to maintain. Any problems? Ferdie Gibson. A terrible business. Do you know, I never dreamt he'd... Have you interviewed Gibson? Mr Tulley was disciplined? Oh, yes. We nearly lost him. Governors finally saw sense and the boy returned. No longer a pupil, of course, and attacked Matthew. But that never came to court. Matthew was exhausted. He spent the best part of a year being dragged through the disciplinary process. Then this assault... Refused point-blank to report it. Wouldn't press charges. Wouldn't even go to hospital. Just wanted to put it behind him and get back to normal. Were there any other incidents, like the one with Ferdie Gibson? Times where Mr Tulley lost his temper? We all lose our tempers, Chief Inspector. A room full of moody adolescents can be very tryingon a wet day. No. Will you be arresting Gibson? It's early days yet. Hey! Where's mine? Here. Come on. Get off. Right, Dean Hendrix not home. Got his girlfriend's details though. I'll pay her a call later and then we've cleared that road. All right. Where do you put it all? Big brain. (GIGGLES) What was that diet you all went on? Grapefruit one. Oh, yeah. Grapefruit and egg. Dire. The only thing that produced was methane. Listen, about tonight, have you booked somewhere? No. Do you think I should? Play it by ear. I've gotta get the kids. Yeah. Get some shopping. Right. Rain check? Oh, no. What do you fancy? Mr er...Vincent, is it? Is it about that murder? Yes. I saw him, you know. Young lad, at the back entry. Running, he was, like the hounds of hell were on his heels. Thanks. So did Matthew have any regular social engagements? Do you have any friends of your own, Lesley? I had. You know how people drift apart, once you all get married. It's even harder once people have children.Too right. And you don't have any of your own? I can't have children. I'm sorry. What about Ferdie Gibson, Mrs Tulley? He attacked your husband and you didn't mention anything yesterday. Sorry. I... Do you think...? We haven't ruled him out. Oh, my God. If you can just bear with us, it's usual in cases like this to establish the movements of the family members. I was in town. What time did you arrive? Not long after nine. You went shopping? Mmm. You'll have the receipts and the parking ticket? Thank you. Is there anything else you remember about the morning? No. Oh, I rang Emma, left a message. We will need to take the clothes you were wearing yesterday for our Forensics, to help eliminate evidence from the scene. I wasn't there. No, but your husband will have carried material from home, from you. We'll take them and we'll leave. How long had you been married to Matthew? Nine years. I'm sorry. I realise how intrusive some of these questions must seem. We have to ask them. I gave up college to marry him. And... ..how would you describe your relationship? We're nearly finished. He was a good man. Nine years. That's a fair while. Must have had its ups and downs. We were fine. Happy. I loved him. I loved him so much. Need to have another look later. (MOBILE RING TONE) Kids. Yes. Butchers, hold on. We've an eyewitness got a lad running from the scene of crime. Time's good and description fits Ferdie Gibson. Nice one. We can go for a line-up. Yeah. Let's see if Ferdie will come in tomorrow afternoon. Probably tell us where to stick it. He might see it as a chance to get us off his back. Butchers, see if tomorrow afternoon suits Mr Vincent. Well, tell them to treat him like cut glass. We don't want him pegging out before he gets to the station. Let the press know we're going for an appeal at 11 tomorrow - Monday. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Yeah? Yeah? No she doesn't. She is vegetarian. Fish is not a vegetable, Pete. Just deal with it. Receipts. Patchy. She didn't buy anything till after 10:30. Gaps after that too. Parking ticket? 9:20, like she said. Get that verified: CCTV. A bloody mess at the moment. Two suspects, got you running in every direction.Yes. I'm hoping Forensics will narrow it down and we've got the press conference and line-up, if we can get Ferdie - Janine, who's top of your list? Well, we've motive and a possible sighting for Gibson, but I'm not convinced, sir. Women's intuition? We've gaps in Lesley Tulley's account. So you reckon she nipped home, committed murder, and then popped back in to finish the shopping, yeah? It's not impossible. These injuries are quite horrific, Janine. Is a woman really capable of this sort of thing? Oh, you'd be surprised, sir. Boss? You might wanna take a look at this. Dean Hendrix. One of the residents, yeah? Denholme Avenue. Unaccounted for. Neighbours haven't seen him. And there's a girlfriend - Paula - ex-pupil of Matthew Tulley's. And Dean's got form? You could say that. He's done time. Three years, young offenders. Knife, GBH... He slit a victim's belly open. Victim nearly disembowelled. Oh, my God. He's done it before. Where the hell is he? I want Dean Hendrix found, top priority. Circulate a description. Get Forensics to put him in the mix. Tell them it's urgent. Shap's found the girlfriend. He's seeing her now. The Lemon's gonna love this, if he thought two suspects was excessive... Right, now, this could be a fluke. The lad's on holiday, not done a runner, but till we've got something concrete, we want to keep all our balls in the air. We keep after Mrs Tulley and Ferdie Gibson. Look sharp, Inspector. Time we started moving furniture. Paula, can I have a word? DS Shap. We're trying to get in touch with Dean Hendrix. What for? It's nothing to worry about. We're talking to everyone who lives on Denholme Avenue, see if they saw anything in connection with the murder. Matthew Tulley's - your old deputy head, yeah? So...Dean? I don't know. Not at your place, then? Is that usual, you not knowing where he is? His place of work? He's freelance. He's working, is he? But he'll be in touch, will he? Ooh, he's not dumped you has he, Paula? Paula. I were thinking, he'll have a mobile, won't he? I could get in touch with him direct.I'll tell him. Why are you searching here? We might find useful leads among Mr Tulley's personal effects. It's all right, Anna. Lesley, this press conference tomorrow morning, we'd like you to issue an appeal for help. Well, do they do any good? Oh, yeah. We get a significant increase in information afterwards. What about Ferdie Gibson? Have you searched his house? Have you questioned him? He has been interviewed. Do you know if your husband kept a knife in his shed at the allotment? I don't know. I never went there. The Lemon asked if I thought a woman was capable of such a thing. No imagination. Hello? Yeah. What did he say? Nice one. Cheers. Bye-bye. The message she left on her sister's phone is still there. Very precise. "It's only half-past nine." Neatly establishing time of day. Yeah. No motive. Condoms. He was playing away. Got a garden at your new place? Flat. Not even a window box. Ours isn't bad. Pete used to do the lot. Lawn's more of a football pitch now, Tom practising his flying tackles. Is Wendy still down there? Yeah. Sold up. She's got her own place. Bin. Yeah? Thanks. No joy from the Hendrix girlfriend. Take it away. Without a warrant. With Mrs Tulley's permission, though she'd be an idiot to have dumped anything in there. Christ, I hope Forensic's got something we can get our teeth into, or the eyewitness comes up with a positive result. If we could just put one of them there. Come on. Let's see what she's got to say about her dirty washing. Thanks, Emma. Lesley, we're eager to locate some clothing that was here yesterday in the washing machine. Sorry? Sports clothing. Yesterday morning's wash. I don't think I did a wash yesterday. Hiya, Ferdinand. It's Ferdie.Whatever. Saturday morning. I was in bed. Prove it. We want to hold an identity parade. See if our witness can pick out who he saw. Well, it wasn't me. So you will attend the line-up? Why should I? To clear your name, Ferdinand. You'd already gone for him with a knife before.He deserved it. He gave me brain damage and he's still 'king teaching. Not now, he ain't. Two o'clock, South Manchester nick. We'll all know what to think if you don't show. 'Dean, it's Paula. What's going on? Ring me. Are you all right? Will you just ring me, please?' You won't see that again, pal. Chenzy, fancy a flutter? Right. We all know we've had our magical 24 hours without a result but that doesn't mean we give up. In fact, we work even harder. Things are starting to open up. Three possible suspects. Lesley Tulley. Motive? Exactly. Nada. Nothing. Tulley claims the marriage was happy. No friends, barely any family. Married nine years. She can't have children, but there are condoms among Mr Tulley's possessions. Cherchez la femme? Could give us a motive. No rumours of another woman, but we're checking his E-mail contacts. Mr Tulley's diaries... nothing obvious. Some unexplained appointments. Other evidence? The clothes. Disappearing act. Lesley Tulley denies all knowledge. Mr Vincent, the lad he saw running, he was wearing sports pants - the type with stripes down the side. The sort my lad calls go-faster stripes. Inspector? Possible. I don't believe in telekinetics. They have to be there still. We're watching the place. Bins revealed nothing, not the initial search. Opportunity? Some gaps. Shap'll be checking CCTV. Ferdie Gibson. Unconfirmed alibi, unless you believe his doting mother sat and watched him sleep. Motive? Revenge. Ferdie never forgave Tulley for the beating he took.Yeah. Taken his time. Years since he last had a go. Evidence? Eye witness. Ferdie's got his invite for the line-up. Ferdie's mate Colin, he was well stressed when I questioned him. Mm. Our weakest link. I might have another bite at Colin. And now our third suspect: Dean Hendrix. Gone missing from home. Previous form. Same MO. Last victim survived, just. I don't want us assuming this is a series. Not yet. We keep working away at all three candidates. Tomorrow, press conference at 11. Plus Forensics should be back by then. (CHEERING) Yeah, thank you. Meanwhile, we'll keep doing what we do best. We want every house ticked off. Every resident accounted for. We go over what we've got and we keep looking. I'm sure there's a bet on already. I don't need to know about that. Just don't let it affect your judgement. That knife is out there somewhere. The clothes worn by the killer, out there. The person who owns that trainer, the one who left dabs on that tap, the person who murdered Matthew Tulley is out there. First 24 hours were crucial. The next, even more so. Don't let me down. TANNOY: 'Would all customers please note that the store will be closing in 15 minutes. Please go to the checkouts...' (MOBILE RINGS) Mr Simon, boss, the bloke who was first on the scene, it turns out he always wears slip-ons, never trainers. Ooh, OK. When we've got the make confirmed, we'll look at Ferdie and friend. And Dean Hendrix, when we find him. Should I check the other gardeners, boss? Butchers, they'll have been covered in house to house. We've established no-one used Tulley's tap or set foot on the plot. Not exactly. We asked if they'd seen owt suspicious, you know, but not exactly whether anyone had used Mr Tulley's tap. Oh, brilliant (!) So the dab and footprint could be some flower pot man filling his watering can? Good of you to share that with me, Butchers. Get back to all the allotment holders and see who took water from Tulley's tap and when. Yes, ma'am. Should I take prints for elimination, boss? No, Butchers, you shouldn't. You'll only have to do that if someone says they've used the tap. Christ! Do you favour one of the other gardeners for this? Know something I don't? No, ma'am? Sure? No-one getting a bit carried away with his fish, blood and bone mix? No, ma'am.Fine. Cos I have got a dead man on my desk, Butchers, and I want him off it before the maggots start to hatch. Just can't get the staff. Oh, shit. How's Michael? Haven't seen much of him. He went round his mates after lunch. Told me he'd be back at yours for eight. He won't report it. Not much point, is there? Oh, Pete. You thinking about him, Janine, or how you look at work? Oh, piss off. All right, do your belt up. Michael? I feel ill. You're drunk. What have you been drinking? Vodka. And cider. Upstairs. What's wrong with Michael? Now. I'm starving. (SIGHS) Mum, did you get the present? Oh, er, yeah. Oh, thank you. Thanks, Mum. Have we any wrapping paper? Richard, hi. Rain check time. I'm sorry. I've only just got back and something's come up with Michael, or is about to. Voila. What are you doing? Memories. I can't bear it. I just want bread. (GASPS) Oh, God! Went out like a light, absolutely rat-arsed. He's only 15. Oh, Janine. No, I worry, I'm his mother. Young lads and booze... Oh, they all do it. He'll be fi- Oh, my God. ELEANOR: What? BOTH: Nothing. So...Richard? Oh, I had to put him off. Ask him over for a drink. It's not that late. Ring him. No. Why not? I'm not ringing him. (PHONE BEEPS) Oh, all right, then. You just have. Yeah, hi, Richard. Boss. (Boss?) Erm...I just erm...wanted to know if you still fancied a... if you wanted a drink, you could come round here. Mm. Sounds great. About half an hour? Mrs Lewis? PC Durham. Are you Michael's mother? Yes. I'm sorry, I tried to call earlier, but Michael was involved in an incident at the Trafford Centre yesterday.I know. He told you? He didn't want to report it. No? Well, the other lad did. His victim. No, erm, Michael was mugged. They were after his mobile. Someone's got their wires crossed. If I could have a word with Michael- It's late and he's asleep. You go away and get your facts straight, then you can talk to him. Now, Mrs Lewis -It's Detective Chief Inspector Lewis, actually. Good night, Constable. What? I just heard. We got the knife. Yes. I'm seeing the bloke who found it first thing. Rough sleeper on the booze. Forensics said they'd give us a call as soon as they can, see if they can link it to any of 'em. But if Mr Vincent picks Ferdie Gibson out the line-up... Why would Ferdie wait till now? Try this. Lesley Tulley gets someone else to do the deed. The clothes are washed at her house. And she gets rid of the weapon. Motive? The someone was her lover, in go-faster stripes. Can you see her sleeping with Ferdie Gibson? Right. She hires him, then. A lump sum and he gets his revenge. Would you trust Ferdie with a mission like that? Why? Why would Lesley kill Matthew? The other woman? Aaah, we'll get there. It's a good enough team. Butchers is not exactly a bundle of joy. Not tonight he isn't. And Shap's all mouth and trousers. Butchers is feeling the pressure. Trial separation. You know what it's like. People outside the job can't relate. People inside are married to it. You and Pete. Me and Wendy. What if Dean Hendrix was the lover boy? 22? That's a bit young for Mrs Tulley. Well, it doesn't matter, does it? So you've not met anyone else since? Oh, give me a chance. Kids and work, work and kids. The job itself isn't exactly a turn-on. Oh, I don't know. That reaction you get at parties, like you've just confessed to drowning kittens. Remember Hendon? Oh, Rich - Mum? This is Richard from work. Hello. What's that manky smell? You're wearing perfume. And eyeliner. Let's get you back to bed. I'll er... Yeah. Go on. I er - Yeah, sorry about, you know - No. Night. Night-night. There, sweetheart. Michael, we're off now. Bye. Hello, Eleanor. Hi, Grandma. Your dad had a terrible night. Oh, Mum. Get a taxi. A taxi? It'll cost the earth. I'll pay. We'll manage. Gonna kick some butt. Tom. It's not a swearword. Three?Oh, good God, woman! The intention is to narrow down the list of suspects, not keep on adding to the collection. Sir. Janine, if this is too much for you, you know, in your condition... ..O'Halloran is just winding up the airport. He should be clear by midweek. So he can take over if you've not made significant headway. I need you to cut to the chase, Janine. We are committed to an 8% improvement in cleared up rates by the end of next month. One cockup and we're all under the magnifying glass. You've got 48 hours, so I suggest you get on with it. What's the problem, sir? This. This...performance review. Financial audit. Measurable bloody outcome, whatever that is. You, you, you - the job, everything, it's just all changed, Janine. Is that my fault? No, no, he can't keep it in his pants. A serial shagger. That's why Wendy dumped him. Owt in a skirt. A tenner says he'll have scored by t'weekend. Morning. Morning, ma'am. Two days. We've got two days, then he's bringing O'Halloran in, and your lives won't be worth living. Boss. Forensics are back. We've got a match on the fingerprint. One of them? Oh, yeah. Who do you reckon? Dean Hendrix. Gibson. Tulley. Inspector? Dean Hendrix, ladies and gentlemen. Now our most wanted, suspect No.1. But that doesn't mean we drop Lesley Tulley and Ferdie Gibson. But, boss, it's obvious - One fingerprint doesn't make a case. If we're looking at a serial offender -He's done it before. He was at the scene and he's gone into hiding. What more do we need?Motive. He's a nutter. Didn't even know his last victim. Picks a fight, the guy's juggling his guts. Hendrix is your man. He's got a taste for it, boss. He'll do it again. We've got to stop him. We've got to find him first. Yes, we go after him. But we work just at hard at our other leads. We've got two days. He's good for it. Listen, if we con-No. If we concentrate on Ji-Inspector? I'll allocate actions. I decide on priorities. We do the press. We do the ID with Ferdie Gibson. We keep after Lesley Tulley and we find Dean Hendrix. He may be top of our list, but there are three suspects on that board. It isn't over until someone's been arrested and charged. Got it? You're not getting anywhere. That's why you're messing us about. Anonymous call from a woman claims Matthew Tulley was a right bastard and that his wife should be glad he's dead. You've heard him saying he'd get Tulley. That was just talk. Was your husband having an affair? No. He'd lied about his first wife. Maybe he lied about this. I wouldn't know, then, would I? This is the last time I pull anything with you. Do you enjoy insulting me, trying to dirty my name? You're lying to me. How long do you think you can hide for? I said I didn't see anyone, and I did. subtitles by Deluxe
