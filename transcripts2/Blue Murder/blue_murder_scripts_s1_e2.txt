 Murder, Matthew Tulley. Deputy Head.
Stabbed to death on his allotment two
days ago. Got three suspects. One, Dean
Hendrix, local lad, fingerprint found
at the scene. Paula, look, um...I've had to go
away for a bit. I'm in Oldham now... Previous form. Mr Williams almost
killed him. Yo, Dean. Hendrix is missing.
We need to find him now. I'm not going down again,
Douggie, no way. Suspect two, nearest and dearest,
wife Lesley Tulley. In town, shopping, but gaps
in the paper trail. Checking CCTV.

 Denies the presence of washing
in a machine that morning. Devastated by his death.
Co-operative. No motive, though. Number three, Ferdie Gibson. Hiya, Ferdinandy. It's Ferdie.
Whatever. Ex-pupil of Tulley's. Clearest
motive he'd assaulted him before. According to Headmaster Bernard
Deaking, Gibson drove Tulley to
the brink. Seen Gibson? You still carry a knife?
It's illegal, innit? You used one on Mr Tulley. Never charged.
Denied everything. Attending an ID parade today. Flakey alibi.

 . It was in her back garden.
What was she burning? Holiday videos,
if you believe that. She must think we're stupid. Get samples. Tell the lab
to fast-track them. Mrs Tulley might just have burnt
her bridges. Look, about last night...
You're following up on the knife.
That's good. Boss...I think we might have
something here. Here she is arriving. Spot the difference. 10:28. Her ticket says 9:22. Well done, Shap. Please, if you know anything at all, anything that might help the police
catch whoever did this to Matthew, please call them now.
Any news about the murder weapon? A knife matching the one used on
Matthew Tulley has been recovered. Forensic tests will determine
whether it is the weapon. Why didn't you tell us
about the knife? You knew when we got here. Matthew was her life and you treat
her like she had something
to do with it. She's never had it easy! You're not getting anywhere, are
you? That's why you're messing us
about. Lesley... Lesley, what was the bonfire for? Cow! We'd been so happy. Holidays. I never thought about it. I'm sorry. If Matthew's killer was known
to him, we'd hope to find information
among his personal effects. Please, leave everything else
in the house as it is. Douggie's had a spot of trouble,
like, so I said I'd stay with him. What sort of trouble?
You don't want to know. Wrong. The police want to talk
to you. I want to see you, Dean.
I can come there. Er...no. Don't. Erm... Look, I'll meet you in Oldham. The coach station, at four.
Right. You should have cleared it
with me first. You know forensics cost a fortune. I think it's crucial, sir. Janine, we're trying to record
the news. Your dad can't get
the video working. It doesn't matter, Mum. But you're on the telly! Mum, really...
Press "Record." Have you got the tape in? I'll ring you later. The bonfire. I think that's how
she got rid of the washing that
was there on Saturday. You're squandering resources on
three separate tracks.
Narrow it down. Anonymous call from a woman claims
Matthew Tulley was a right bastard and that his wife should be glad
he's dead. Crank?
We're checking it. Boss.
Mm? Matthew Tulley's parents.
Mm-hm? Just got back from a weekend
in Paris, seen the news, want to know why we didn't try
and contact them. What with, a ouija board?
We were told they were dead. I said you'd ring them back. Yeah, I want to see them, as well.
Where are they? Er...Lymm. Right. I'm taking an early lunch. Parental stuff. Michael's school. Then we'll visit Ferdie Gibson's
friend Colin. We'll see what Mr and Mrs Lazarus
have to say after that. We're very worried about Michael's
attitude. His performance is disappointing, and now these allegations
of bullying have been made. Well, no wonder his work's going
downhill. You have an anti-bullying policy,
don't you? Mrs Lewis, Michael isn't being
bullied. Walk! He's doing the bullying. Michael?
Well, there are four of them, harassing two students in their
year, sending text messages. There may be some thefts too.
Mobile phones. Where's Michael? He should know
what he's being accused of. Michael isn't in school. It appears he left after
registration. Pete, is Michael with you? No. Why?
He's bunked off school. I've just been in. He's got in with the wrong crowd. Pete, they've been nicking mobile
phones, bullying other kids. So he got a taste of his own
medicine Saturday? Janine? I don't think he gave us
the full story. Police came round last night. Their version was that Michael
was the villain. Why didn't you tell me?
Christ, Janine! It was late. I thought they'd cocked it up and... Michael was drunk.
What? He's 15! How old were you first time
you got drunk? I was never a thief. Look, I expect he's with his mates.
If you hear from him, just... What? Just don't go mad at him. Any word on Dean Hendrix? No sign. It's you that's in trouble, isn't it?
Not Douggie. Paula!
Tell me what's going on. Look, I can't. Forget it, then.
Paula, please. If you don't talk to the police,
they'll come after you, Dean. You know something, don't you? That murder.
I've done nothing wrong, Paula. You've got to believe me.
Why should I? And they won't, will they?
You see? If I do... You're lying to me. I'm not going to sit around
waiting for you to straighten out. How long do you think you can hide
for? We're in business.
Ferdie's turned up. Mr Vincent? Yeah. You've been asked to pick out
the person you saw running from the allotments on Gorton Avenue
on Saturday morning, 22nd February. Take your time.
Walk up and down a couple of times. And if you see the person,
just tell me their number. Can you ask them
to look about a bit? Will you put your baseball caps
on back to front, please? And turn to the left. And to the right. And left. And right. And face forward. You see, he was running. Ferdinand Gibson. Ferdie's down the station now,
Colin, helping us with our enquiries. Thought you could help, too.
I told the other guy everything. Tell us again. Ferdie came round at about one. We went down to the pub.
One o'clock? Yeah, about then. You didn't see Ferdie earlier on
Saturday? No. I told you, I was in bed. Really? See, we know he'd attacked
Mr Tulley once already. Probably talked about
having another go. You've heard him saying he'd get
Tulley, haven't you? That's just talk. Everyone says
stuff like that. Yeah. But Ferdie follows through, though,
doesn't he? We've a witness, got someone
like Ferdie near the scene of crime. We're not talking taking
without owner's consent now, Colin. Murder. If Ferdie is charged,
and you've withheld information, you could be done for obstruction, or attempting
to pervert the course of justice. Better for you if you're straight
with us. Well? I was here. I didn't see Ferdie till
one, all like I said. Dead loss, your old codger,
Mr Vincent. Picked Andy from Traffic. (MOBILE PHONE RINGS)
A lot chillier today. Yeah? OK. Thanks. Line-up. No joy. When we spoke on the phone, you said
you hadn't seen your son recently. Not for years. We didn't even know
Matthew had got married again. He's got nephews and nieces
he's never even seen. He just didn't want to know. Matthew had been married before?
Awful business. They were divorced
before they'd even given it a go. They were far too young.
Still at college. When was this? 19...79. What was her name?
Laura. Laura Billing. Do you know where she is now?
No. He told this Lesley we were dead,
didn't he? And you've no idea who did it? What does that tell us
about Matthew Tulley? That he was a liar. Why pretend they're dead? And this first wife. Let's find her, see what
she has to say. Next lot of forensics is in.
Bonfire? Trainer. Hi-Tec, Walklite, tens. Get Shap to check out Ferdie
Gibson's shoes. We know how unreliable ID parades
are. Doesn't mean he's off the hook. Anything from Lesley? Hair and skin traces on his body
and clothes. Gives us nothing. They shared a bed. The lab say the killer and the knife
would have been awash with blood. Send Butchers back to Mr Vincent. Get him to take him through it
bit by bit in minute detail. Oh, God. An old classmate said Gibson made
personal comments about Tulley's
wife. That's when Tulley went ballistic. Jealous?
Could be. We need to dig around some more. Did Ferdie Gibson know Lesley
Tulley? And I want to press her on this car
park business and cutting herself up. Perhaps everything wasn't
quite so rosy. Mum. Oh, God. Which hospital? I'm on my way. It's Tom. He's had an asthma attack
at school. They've had to call an ambulance. Go for it. He's all right. He responded well. Oh, God...
It was... They want to keep him in overnight. You thought he was all right
for school? Sometimes it's hard to tell. And the job comes first. That's not fair.
Really? Michael's going off the rails.
He'll land up in court before long. Tom's left to fend for himself. I can't do it all on my own.
I'm having a bloody good try. You walked out on them.
That has a lot more to do with it. Oh, yeah. Back to that. Can you stay till tea time? Would you rather do overnight? Well, no, I can't... OK. I'll get Sarah to bring Eleanor home,
stay at ours. I'll bring Tom's things. I love you. If anything happens anything -
ring me. Ferdie, where are you?
You said you'd be here. Shit! There's someone at the door,
Ferdie! It's me, Colin. What? Open the door! Clown. They've been here. They didn't
believe me. Threatened me
with being an accessory and that. You didn't tell them anything,
did you? No, honest. Don't worry, then. That'll be our man. All right, mate?
All right? All right? Right... If you want a sample,
help yourself. Previously unidentified male is
Douglas Connor, known to Oldham
Constabulary. Oldham are running drug
surveillance. They've got this lad in their sight.
They'll keep us informed. Don't look now, but we are not
alone. OK, so Butchers is knocking doors
and you're back to Ferdie, yeah? Janine.
Sir? Problems with the family? Skeletons in the closet, sir. Apparently Tulley was married before and his dead parents are alive
and well and living in Lymm. Your family. Oh. Nothing I can't handle, sir,
but thanks for asking. Jade, hurry up and get down here. Now, he's not going to eat you. He just wants to ask us
a couple of questions. Hello. Now, you know a man's been hurt,
over on the allotments. Did you see anyone near there
on Saturday? She's not allowed down there. But, you know, you might have seen
something from your window. No, I didn't see owt.
I was watching t'telly. Hey, what did I do?
Frighten the children? Last night, we were getting on fine. Today I'm pulling a shift
with the ice queen. What?
Come on. Put me straight. Look, Richard, can we talk about
this some other time? I want to talk about it now. Oh, God, well... OK. You and Wendy.
You made out it was like Pete and me. Yeah.
She chucked you out, didn't she? After numerous affairs. What are you getting at?
Did she? Numerous. What does "numerous" mean? Yeah, she chucked me out. You chucked Pete out.
He had a choice. Just because you gave him
an ultimatum. That's not the point. You like to play the field. I have done. It's all right, Richard. Three kids, one on the way. I'm
flattered I made it to your list
in the first place. List? List? Right. I'll cross you off my "list", then! Good. Fine. OK. Yeah.
Right! Right! . What did Matthew tell you
about his family? Well, he hadn't any. His parents died in a car crash
when he was at college. He was an only child. Why? We've spoken to Matthew's parents. Have you any idea
why he'd tell you they were dead? No.
And they have a daughter, Matthew's sister, married with
children. I don't know what to say. I... Do they know about me? No. Matthew had been married before. No. We've verified the records, Lesley. He was married in 1979,
they separated a year later. No. Laura, she was called. He never told you? Emma said you'd not had an easy
time. What did she mean? Just... Sometimes I get depressed. And yet you claim the marriage
was happy? Did either of you have affairs? No! What time did you leave the house
on Saturday? About nine o'clock. You know this. So you arrived in town at what time? Twenty past. Where did you get the parking
ticket? From the machine in the car park. Your ticket doesn't correspond to
your actual arrival at the car park. The ticket you gave us was for 9:22. Yeah. That's right. Where did you get it?
From the machine. What did you do with the clothes
from the washing machine?
We'll find them. We can recover traceable fibres,
even from ashes. This is Matthew's diary. Last year. Turn to March 17th. See the asterisk there,
and the time? Eight o'clock.
Do you know what that means? St Patrick's Day. Can you remember what
your husband did that evening? No. Probably something
with the school or the church. No, we've checked.
June 7th, an asterisk again. 8:30. September 6th, November 29th. And this year, this coming Friday. Did your husband have any plans
for this Friday? No.
Maybe he didn't want you to know. We found condoms
among your husband's things. Why would he need condoms? I've no idea.
You can't have children. No. Was your husband having an affair?
No! You're sure?
Yes. He'd lied about his first wife.
Perhaps about this too. I wouldn't know, then, would I? Get the tin. Get the tin.
Get the tin. Go on. Go! Go! Hiya, Ferdie. Thought I'd find you
in. You must be Colin. DS Shap.
Just a couple of questions. Harassment, that's what this is. Next time you'll have to arrest me,
and then I want a brief. Yeah, quite right. Fair enough. Colin. Now, first off, Ferdie, what size feet have you got?
Ten. Why? Those got a size on 'em? 44. That a ten in English money,
is it? Dunlops. Got any other trainers? Not made of money, am I? How well do you know Mrs Tulley,
Ferdie? Don't know her. You sure about that?
She's a lovely-looking woman. Out of your league? You got
a girlfriend, Ferdie? Is that a no? You'd know her as Lesley
if you're on first-name terms. Don't know her. Bumped into her at school, maybe?
Open day? She ask you for anything, Ferdie? Ask you to do her a favour,
money in it? You're off your head, you are. Are you off yours? Colin! What size feet have you got, Colin? Tricky question. Phone a friend. Nines. Enjoy the rest of the day,
won't you, lads? (SNIFFS) He knows we've got some stuff.
Mucking about. Why didn't he do us?
I don't know, do I? Probably wants a cut, don't he?
That's all we need. Dodgy copper on our backs.
That's good, in a way, innit? If he's winding you up, maybe
they've stopped looking at you
for the murder. I thought he was going to charge you
when he brought you in here. You think I did it, don't you? I was with you all morning.
How could I do Tulley? Not till half ten. Oh, brilliant, great that, Colin. Tell you what, this is the last time
I pull anything with you. You're shitting yourself half the
time and dissing your mates the
next. Just divide the stuff up
and then I'm gone for good. Got it? I'd like you to try and picture him
over there by the gate. Looking about.
Try and keep him in your mind. What's he look like? Like I said. And he was out of breath. Panting a bit, from running. Was there any sign of blood? Didn't notice any. Was he carrying anything? Yes. In his hand. Something wrapped up, in a bag,
like. Right, Mr Vincent, I want you
to look at these photographs and
we'll see if he's here, OK? I don't know. Where's Gary? Gone to get petrol.
Busy week, innit? (BANGING AT DOOR)
Police! Open up! Hide it in the tank. OK, OK! I'm coming! Get your hands off, I'm telling you! There's a blade in there. Illegal weapon. Whose is this, then? Get him out! Got no-one to help you! Don't struggle, son. Gary!
Shit! Douggie! All right, son. Come on. Out of the car! Get out of the car! Good night. There's been an incident. Drugs
round-up in Oldham went sour. Main
suspect got run over. DOA, but they've got Dean Hendrix. They're transferring him first thing. Excellent. There's more, though. Guess who
Dean's mates were selling to? Tulley?
Ferdie. And Ferdie needed dosh to set up in
business so him and his mate Colin
went and took some. The off-licence raids. That's why Colin was sweating.
That's where they were on Saturday. And then there were two. OK, we know Dean was at
the allotment. We lifted
his fingerprints. Mr Vincent identified his photo. He also picked out the wrong face
from the line-up. Done it before, plus he goes AWOL.
All we've got on Lesley is a dodgy parking ticket
and some missing washing. He's no motive.
Nor has she. All right. They plan it together. Dean kills Tulley
and Lesley helps cover the traces. She takes the knife and burns
the clothing. I'd like to see her reaction
when she finds out he's in custody. You going to tell her?
Yeah, tomorrow. Oh, God. I must make tracks. How's Tom? Yeah, he's er...sitting up,
chattering. I'm on the night shift. If there's anything I can do. Ferdinand Gibson. Ferdinand Gibson, I'm arresting you on suspicion of possession of
a Class A drug, namely cocaine, with intent to supply,
and on suspicion of armed robbery. (READS HIS RIGHTS)
Who grassed me up? Colin...
(CONTINUES READING RIGHTS) Let me tell my mam.
We only live there. We'll tell her. Let me give her her shopping, then.
Get in, Einstein. TV: Please, if you know anything
at all, anything that might help the police
catch whoever did this to Matthew... Jade! You should have worn your black suit
for the telly. You looked funny. Your nose looked bigger. Well, thank you, darling. Your nose is the only bit of you
that never stops growing. That's something to look forward to. Oh, aye. I made this for Tom. Oh, that's lovely. He'll like that. Now...bath. Oh, no, damn! Packed lunch! I can do her packed lunch.
Just calm down. I hate dumping on you like this.
I'd never have guessed. I'll pay you back. You can
defrost my freezer. So, what's the story with lover boy? Oh... I don't know. It's daft, isn't it? It'd would be so nice, a bit of love
and affection. Having a baby on my own
and it's the loneliest place to be. Thanks. Bye.
Bye. I'm going back to the hospital now. Michael, I went into school today. Mr Corkland wanted to see me. Said
there had been problems at school. And last night,
a policeman came here. He said he wanted to talk to you. I don't know what's going on
but we need to talk about it soon. Don't push it, Michael.
Or what? You'll lock me up? Evening. Is Michael in? Yeah. Through here. Michael. About Saturday the Trafford Centre. You were involved in an attempt
to steal a mobile phone. Someone tried to rob me. Don't mess me about. You're in
enough trouble. How about you tell me what really
happened? We were just mucking about.
Just a bit of fun? That's not how the other lad
sees it. Not funny at all. He hasn't been sleeping very well
since then. Think yourself lucky, Michael.
You're not being charged this time. Next time, we'll have you lifted.
Do you understand? Yes. This is an official warning. You look like a decent enough lad. Sort yourself out. I don't want to meet you again. The other lad? Shaken. They roughed him up a bit.
A free-for-all. The security guards got there
quickly and this lot bolted. I'm sorry. Nah, I reckon he's learned
his lesson. They all need a bit of discipline
at his age. Hairy things beneath the bed. Hairy Big and Hairy Small. I'm glad I have...no hair at all. Hey, how are you doing, soldier?
I had chocolate cereal. Chocolate! What did they say? They'll discharge him. We're waiting. How long's that gonna be?
I don't know. And what then?
(WHISPERS) Stop it. What? Using this to pick a fight with me. You're so bloody selfish. If you take him home, I'll collect
him later. Sarah can get Eleanor. Tina thinks we need to sort out
fixed arrangements. Shame the pair of you didn't think
more about the kids in the first
place. Christ, Pete! We need some routine. I don't do regular shifts.
I do overtime at a moment's notice. And the kids, well...things happen. Life's messy. It won't work if you start being
inflexible. Yeah, it won't work for you.
For them! Mum! Dad! Pow, pow! So Dad's going to take you to his.
I'll see you later. Mum! Yeah, I love you too. Me llamo Ian. Buenos dias. Que tal? Me llamo Ian. Lardio, shift it, that's my plaza. . # And so we're off to sunny Spain # Spanish lessons. Yeah? And that's going to help you
score with the senoritas? You can see the difference already. Ta.
Thanks. The Gibson angle. Drugs. No link to Tulley. Ferdie Gibson and
friend were behind the robberies. They used the cash to buy cocaine
from a firm operating out of Oldham. There is a connection, though. Dean Hendrix chose the house
in Oldham to hole up in. Two crimes for the price of one? Never have got him without Oldham.
Hard to say, sir. Sheer fluke. Can't take any credit.
One of the suspects lost his life. Car drove over him. His accomplice. It's a bloody mess. Still, that Oldham's problem, innit? As for ours...I'd like your written
report on my desk by the end
of the day ready for O'Hallaran. He'll be taking over first thing
tomorrow. But, sir...
Sorry, I've got to go. Bag his clothes when he gets in.
If the trainers look likely, put
them through as a priority. I won't see him walk
for the sake of a few hundred quid. Any news on Mrs Tulley's bonfire?
No, boss. First wife, boss. Cited cruelty in the divorce. Also claimed that he was
physically violent. Mm, was he, now? Nothing on Tulley's e-mail
addresses, but something dodgy
on a phone number. This guy, Ronald Prosser. He don't live there any more
but the woman were suspicious.
Turns out he's doing time. Possession of a Class A drug.
Sentenced May last year. Connection with Tulley? Get more on that, Shap. I wouldn't
have had Tulley down for drugs. But that could be his connection
with Dean Hendrix. Will be good to see how Lesley
reacts to Dean getting nicked. Yeah, exactly. Hendrix was associating with known
dealers. Maybe a deal gone bad? Yeah. I'll be at Ashgrove if anyone
wants me. Come on in. Would you like some tea? No milk,
I'm afraid. Emma's gone shopping. No, I'm fine, you go ahead. There's been a new development.
I wanted you to know. We've arrested someone.
Who? Dean Hendrix. Do you know him? No. No, I don't. He's local. Maybe you know him by
sight. No. Matthew never mentioned
a Dean to you? What about a Ronald Prosser?
No. I'll be interviewing Dean Hendrix
later this morning. Is there anything you want to tell
me, Lesley? What do you mean? I think you know.
No. Do you enjoy this? Does this make you feel clever? Insulting me? Trying to dirty
my name? Janine? Richard. Dean Hendrix. We've made a mistake. We know he was there. But he can't use the knife. He's left-handed, Janine.
It can't possibly be him. Ferdie is out of the picture.
Dean can't have done it. Which leaves us with one suspect. Janine? What's wrong? Where are you? You're at Tulley's.
Yes. Can you talk?
No. Janine, get out of there now.
Janine? Janine? Bad news? You had problems, you and Matthew?
We were very happy. You had depression.
And you cut yourself, don't you? I've seen the scars. You're not happy. Was Matthew?
We were fine. Perhaps Matthew started looking
for something outside the marriage. You never had children? I can't. I already told you.
I had a hysterectomy. Maybe a cause of strain between you?
Matthew may have wanted children. (SIGHS) No. He loved me.
It didn't matter. But it was all lies, wasn't it? He lied to you about his parents.
They didn't even know you existed. Stop.
He lied that you were the first. He was already married to Laura.
No. He fooled you, didn't he? He kept it
all from you. It was a sham, your marriage -
a pack of lies! No! I'll be on my way. Headmaster.
Bernard Deaking. I've just come to offer my
condolences. She's still very shaken up. I'm fine! Alive and kicking.
Ooh! I'm being kicked! Are you? Can I?
Yeah. Can I? Where is it? Oh, yeah. (LAUGHS) Get back to work. Yeah. So, anything from the lab? No trace of fibres in the ashes,
just residue from the videotapes. I'm applying for a warrant. Search?
And arrest. The Lemon's given me
till the end of today. I hope Dean Hendrix gives us
something. Room One. And the trainer's a match. Plus, they've recovered a knife. Do you want a coffee?
Yeah. Right, so what have we got? We know Dean didn't use the weapon.
He's left-handed. But he was at the allotment.
Egging her on? Restraining Matthew for her?
Maybe it all went pear-shaped. He couldn't do it in the commotion
so Lesley stepped in. He could have got rid of the knife. And the one he had with him? Maybe they both had a knife?
Yeah... Lesley got to strike first. We know Dean likes to be tooled up.
Probably feels naked without one. Boss, the guy you wanted
the background on, Ronald Prosser. They were also looking at him
for distributing obscene material. Charges were dropped. He were released last week.
Drugs and porn? Can you see a link to Mr Tulley
with either of those? You can't tell by looking, though,
can you? Get us that coffee and a fudge...
And a fudge brownie. Can you tell us where you were
on Saturday morning, Dean? Oldham. At my mate Douggie's. Yeah, I was sorry to hear about the
accident. You were good friends? When were you at Matthew Tulley's
allotment? Never. Don't lie to me. We have forensic evidence that puts
you at the scene of a nasty murder. You should consider your replies
very carefully. What evidence? Evidence, Dean, only you
could have left. Do you know what also interests me? Matthew Tulley had had his belly
slit open from top to bottom. You'd know all about that, wouldn't
you? What that looks like. What it feels like
to carve someone up. I didn't do it. You were there.
Friday, not Saturday. What for?
Just to give Mr Tulley something. Go on.
A tape, that's all. So you knew Mr Tulley?
Only because of the videos. I'd collect them from him
and then bring back a master copy. He wanted his dirty stuff editing. Look at the tape, you'll see. So it was Friday. When I got to the allotment,
he wasn't there. He'd be teaching, wouldn't he,
Friday? Night. Friday night. About seven. No. No, you were at the allotments
on Saturday. All the evidence puts you there.
Fingerprint. Footprint. Witness testimony. And you ran away. Why the hell should we believe
a word you say? You helped Lesley Tulley,
didn't you, Dean? Why was that?
What was in it for you? What happened, Dean? Saturday
morning, you weren't in Oldham. That video we found in his stuff.
It's filmed at Tulley's place. Hendrix says he ran errands for
Tulley, getting tapes edited. Claims that's why he was there. The search and arrest warrants
have been granted. Maybe Lesley stumbled on
Matthew's home-made porn collection. Went for him in a fit of jealousy. Could explain the contact
with Prosser. Right, I think I'll leave this to you
lot. Easy on the popcorn. (SCREAMING) Matthew! Stop it!
Please! Stop it! Stop it, Matthew! That's Lesley Tulley.
Stop it! No more! Stop it, Matthew! Stop it, please!
Sweet Jesus! This is sick.
Is that Tulley? Stop it, Matthew!
The one with the knife? That will explain the scars.
She never cut herself. No. No, Tulley's the cameraman.
He's filming it. The bonfire. This is what she... Matthew! Shap, pause it! The hand. We've got our motive. Look at that guy's hand. I'm sure... It's Deaking. The headmaster? Yeah, I've just left him
at Lesley's house! Lesley! Lesley!
(SCREAMING) DEAKING: Come on, Lesley!
Where is it? Upstairs.
Tell me! Richard, down here!
Where is it? Lesley! For Christ's sakes,
tell me where the bloody tape is! I am arresting you for attempted
murder. You do not have to say anything... ..you later rely on in court.
Anything you do say... You're making a mistake. She was in
town. She wouldn't hurt Matthew! They're being processed now. We're taking Deaking first. The
search of the house is under way. Let them both stew for a bit. We'll have another crack at Dean. I want him to think
he is still centre stage for this. Maybe he'll admit they were colluding
if he thinks we'll go easier on him. Interview resumed, 11am. Lesley Tulley tell us about her.
I don't know her. Oh, come on, Dean.
Straight up, I don't. I'd never seen her before the
videos. You live just round the corner. It's quite handy for popping round
when Mr Tulley's at school. No. No, I never.
Mr Hendrix answered your question. He does not know Lesley Tulley. Even though he has a porn tape
of her? Let me tell you how I see it, Dean.
You can put me right. Mrs Tulley's a very attractive
woman. Perhaps she was lonely. I only go with my girlfriend.
What's your work? Freelance.
Freelance what? Odd jobs. Backstage at the Lowry now
and then, G-Mex, a bit of driving. Pay well?
No, not really. Hm! Quite tempting if someone
offered you a sizeable amount of money
for your services. Don't know what you mean. Mr Tulley was attacked with a knife
and bled to death on Saturday. A witness saw you running from
the scene. Forensic evidence proves you were
there. A knife was in your possession. You can see how someone might think
you were helping her. Perhaps getting rewarded for your
pains. Maybe you'd seen all the videos. Strong stuff. Can be addictive, can't it? That's enough!
It wasn't me. I didn't kill him. But you've done it before.
Mr Williams. No. A bit of a fight. Out comes a knife. It wasn't the same. Virtually identical.
It wasn't the same. What, you get a taste for it?
Gives you a buzz? No, last time...
Last time what? Last time...
He struggled more? No, he raped me! Poor bastard. He never spoke about it. Never used it in his defence. He was ashamed. He probably blamed himself.
Something he said, something he did. I reckon he'll give us the real
story when he's calmed down. Deaking should be ready now. Shall we? My client would like to make
a statement. He admits to taking part
in the sex sessions with Mrs Tulley which were filmed by her husband. But he strenuously denies
the charge of attempted murder. He was simply trying to find out if
Mrs Tulley knew where the tape was. By choking the life out of her? Always so normal, aren't they? The Deakings of this world. All that respectability and a shed
full of porn. He goes to buy a tape from one of his
regular suppliers and who's on it? Lesley. His deputy's wife.
He doesn't do anything, not yet. He waits till Tulley's in trouble. Tulley keeps his job
after the assault on Ferdie Gibson cos Deaking backs him to the hilt
in return for... A piece of the action. Was he really trying to kill her? He'd lost it. He was scared she'd
talk, give us the tapes. She wouldn't see him. Wouldn't take his calls. When Lesley said she couldn't find
the videos, he didn't believe her. Whatever he gets, he'll never pick
up a piece of chalk again. Add that to the Dangerous Substances
Register. Right, let's do it. Lesley, when we spoke earlier,
I asked you about this man. I'm showing you a photo of Ronald
Prosser. You denied knowing him. I don't know him. He's just out of prison for drug
offences but there were
lesser charges for pornography. That's how Matthew knew him,
isn't it? I've no idea. And Mr Deaking, we know all about
that now. We've got this. I'm showing Lesley Tulley
video cassette Item 439. We've watched the film. It's just a film. It's hard to watch. Unbearable. Violence. We know what Matthew made you do. What Deaking did. It changes everything. You can tell us, Lesley. I haven't got anything to say. What about Dean Hendrix?
How well do you know him? I don't. Only that you said
that you'd arrested him. Yeah, he's been very helpful.
He gave us the tape. Did you need a friend to share your
troubles? A lover?
No, I don't know who he is. The knife we recovered, the murder
weapon, turned up in town
Saturday morning. I'll tell you what I think.
You followed Matthew to the
allotments. You had the knife.
You hurt him. Badly. No. You went home. Blood on your hands, on your
clothes. Stop it. I loved Matthew. You cleaned yourself up,
put the clothes in the machine. We've got people searching
your house. Fine. You took the knife, you went into
town, took someone else's parking
ticket. I can't explain the ticket.
Maybe the clock on the machine... We have CCTV footage.
How did you get to the Triangle? Through Millennium Gardens.
Did you put anything in a bin? A sandwich wrapper. I didn't kill Matthew.
Why are you doing this to me? Maybe you had a friend to help you. Did you take Dean along to confront
Matthew? Was he there in case you couldn't go
through with it? This is completely crazy.
I don't know Dean. Maybe he'd watched the videos. Seen
some of the terrible things you had
to suffer. How long had it been going on,
Lesley? Months? Years? Did Matthew make you watch
the films with him? I didn't do anything. I didn't do it. I didn't... Please. So can I have your update? There have been a lot of
developments. Which I expect to hear from you,
not from rumours flying around
the office. Gossip about serial killers.
Drugs connections. The Tulley woman hiring an assassin. And you nearly had her corpse
on your hands. And you're digging up the garden at
the house. I'm confident that will turn up
the missing clothes. We've now got her involved in
production of pornographic material. I'm not talking blue movies, sir. The woman is being tortured
while her husband films it. Deaking was an active player.
He tried to silence Mrs Tulley. What about the serial offender,
Dean Hendrix? I'm on my way back now. He's opening up.
If he was in on it, he will own up. If you don't find these missing
clothes, what have you got? The attempt to create an alibi. Circumstantial, Janine.
CPS won't wear it. Then I'll get them to talk, secure
a confession. Communication skills,
sir. I've done the course. You prearranged to meet
Matthew Tulley at his allotment. Did you usually meet there?
Yes. Never his house?
No. You'd take the tapes
and return an edited version? Yep. You were there Saturday morning,
bringing him a completed tape. Yeah. Have you ever met Lesley Tulley?
No. Did you conspire to kill
Matthew Tulley? No! You don't have to be the one
holding the knife to be charged. Murder, Dean. It doesn't get any
heavier, and you are up to your neck in it. I've got you at the scene. You've got previous form
for an almost identical attack. You've got a porno film with a dead
man's wife in it. You do a runner. Why shouldn't I charge you with
murder? Because he was already dead
when I got there. What time was this? Half ten, near enough. How did you know he was dead?
There was blood on the ground. He wasn't moving. I tried to turn him over
and I saw... You know.
Where did you find him, exactly? He was lying on his front
by the shed. Sort of half in, half out. Why didn't you call us, Dean?
I freaked out. It was like before! The same... People would fit me up for it. I've already got previous for GBH
on Williams. You all thought it
was me! Your heading for the hills didn't
exactly help. Did you see anything else
at the scene? No. A knife?
No. Anyone in the vicinity?
Think carefully! And you washed your hands at the
tap. Yeah. OK. Thanks. No clothes yet. But they found a hiding place
in the dining room. Empty. We've not got enough to hold her. Send her home?
One more shot? Solicitor's asked for a break. It's your son, boss. Tom? Michael. He's outside. I'm locked out. I forgot my keys.
Shouldn't you be in school? Review day?
Oh, God! Michael, timing! Come on! Eh, Chen's going to win the bet. So, you reckon the boss is going
to nail our Mrs Tulley, do you? I dunno. 20/1 by teatime. Better her than O'Hallaran. Aye.
At least she's straight with us. I suppose so. She's having a fair crack at it,
in't she? Not bad. For a bird. Speaking of which... You want to have a look at these. Look at the castanets
on that senorita. You could show her your power tool. I suppose I could. Tell Inspector Mayne I'll be quarter
of an hour, no more. How was your review? Mr Corkland said your work's
suffering. You're a bright boy.
You've worked hard. Now this. These so-called mates,
where have they sprung from? We have a laugh, that's all. What? Stealing? Pushing people about? Sending nasty text messages?
As a family, we... What family? You want me to be just like you,
don't you? Do you know what my nickname is?
The Bill. They all think I'm a grass because
of you. I'm proud of what I do, Michael.
I'm not going to apologise for it. You ram it down my throat
all the time. So uncool. Oh, grow up! It pays the bills.
Puts food on the table. Takeaways! Whatever. People kill, I catch them.
I don't care how deeply uncool it
might be. It's a bloody important job.
It's all you care about. Now, that's not true. I care about you. I want you to be safe. I want you to be happy. You're not a bully.
I know you're not. Michael... I can't be... What made you do it? It was meant to be a joke. The messages. Seeing how people would react. I didn't think they'd... It just went a bit too far. And the thefts? Sort of a dare. Look, these lads. Do you like them,
really? Do you think they'll be good
friends? They're not doing you any favours,
are they? What will they be doing in five, ten
years' time? Picture yourself there. Sorry. It's been a rotten year, I know
that. With your dad and everything. We both love you,
nothing's going to change that. We're seeing Mr Corkland on Friday.
Think about what you're going to say. I want you to write a letter.
What? It's not me you're saying sorry to. Write a letter to that lad on
Saturday, say you're sorry. Turning things round, Michael.
It starts here. Putting things right. Now you can start your confession. I promised my mam
I wouldn't play down the back. And I went one day. Only for a bit,
though. Why does your mum not want you
playing down there? It's not safe. It's very important to keep those
rules. The ones that keep us safe. Are you sorry for what you did? Yes, Father. You won't do it again, will you?
No, Father. Good. Now, is there anything else? I told a lie to the policeman. I said I didn't see anyone,
and I did. See anybody? On the allotments on Saturday.
You know. Do you mean where they found
Mr Tulley? Yes, Father. You did see someone?
Yes, running away. Why didn't you tell anyone
what you'd seen? I was scared. I see. I think...it would be good if you
told the police what you saw.
Don't you? It could be very important. I'll have a word with your mum to make sure you don't get
in any trouble. How does that sound? All right. Search completed. They took the place apart. Nothing, boss. Let her go. It was the lady on telly. The one on the news that were asking
for help. What were the lady doing?
Running away. What else can you remember
about her? Someone had hurt her. They did. They battered her. She was all covered in blood!
Like a nosebleed. You're a diamond. Later. Shap. Kid at No.7 saw Lesley Tulley
running from the scene, dripping blood, Saturday morning. Why the hell didn't we have this
sooner? No-one was in on the first
house-to-house. When Butchers first interviewed
the kid, she lied. She thought telling us
would get her into trouble. (SIGHS) Heaven's sake! Time. Definitely before 9:25. She saw the end of erm... ..Digit? Diggin' It. How old?
Seven. She's a witness, though.
I'm getting Lesley back in. Is it enough?
It's all I've got. I'm not going to let O'Hallaran
take the credit. We've worked bloody hard on this. And we are nearly there. Yeah? You're the boss, boss. Yeah. Is there anything you wish to say,
Lesley? If I could help in any way,
don't you think I would? I loved my husband. Is that why you put up with his
perversions? The torture? A witness has come forward.
They can place you at the allotments, shortly after
9am. What? You were covered in blood
and running away. Later, you get rid of the knife
in a litter bin in town. We found that knife. So we can place you at the scene
and we can link you to the weapon. We can show that you consistently
lied to investigating officers and constructed a false alibi. And we've motive. You suffered horrific sexual
and physical abuse in your marriage. I didn't do it. Trouble, boss. But it's an eyewitness!
An eight-year-old. Seven. She gave us a detailed
description. Time as well. If I can just work at it. Janine! You've no clothes,
no forensics, no chance. Release Mrs Tulley. But, sir, I think if I...
Release her. They searched the drains.
There's nothing on the premises. It doesn't add up.
They were in the washing machine. The woman's had a police escort.
She's been nowhere. Why not burn 'em with the tapes?
Too obvious? The bonfire was hardly subtle!
Unless... she'd already got rid of them
by Sunday night. No. You said yourself she...
But wait! She did leave the house.
We took her. Oh, shit!
We're going to be too late. . I'm cleaning, love.
Have you done the bins? Eh? What? Keep Hackett off my back! We found them in the mortuary.
I don't know what you mean. I'm sure we'll get a conviction. The question is whether the act
was premeditated or not. You claimed you loved him, Lesley.
But his love had become... a monstrous thing. It was destroying you. It wasn't like that.
Please, Mrs Tulley, I advise you to take counsel. We had a row. A terrible row. He was hitting me and I thought
he was going to kill me. There was a knife on the table
in the shed. It's the knife. I was so frightened. I didn't mean to hurt him. What did you do? I didn't know what to do.
I was scared. And the parking ticket? Stranger. I asked him for his
ticket. So this row, what was all that
about? (SIGHS) It was about the filming. I wanted it to stop. He promised. He said I wouldn't
have to do it again. What were you doing at the
allotments? I went with him to help him out.
No, you're still lying to us. Matthew was seen arriving alone. You had no cuts and bruises.
It wasn't self-defence. You know what he did to me.
It was self-defence. Do you remember the diary? Little stars... Film night. Friday was the next one. Prosser was coming back. He was so... I can't have children. Matthew told the hospital
that I'd been depressed. I tried to abort myself. It was
really plausible. Do you know what
they'd used on me that time? You thought you'd get away with it. No. No, I couldn't think. I'd done a terrible thing and I felt guilty and Matthew... You followed him.
You took a knife and you killed him. There was a cut on his arm
where he tried to stop you. Nine years, Lesley. Why didn't you leave him? Because I loved him. Once, one time, I packed. I couldn't do it. I was terrified. That he'd find you? That I would lose him. So...why Saturday? Why not Saturday? He'd lied to me. He promised I wouldn't have to do it
again and he broke his promise. You could have gone to your
sister's. No, I couldn't. Why not? Because he'd get someone else
if I went! It would be easy enough to find another girl and teach her
exactly like he had me! Break her. So you killed him. I couldn't let him do that. (GASPS) I mean... Imagine that level of control. And she goes to identify his body with the freshly-washed clothes
in a bag right under our noses. Yeah. What must it do to you? Your head, your heart,
living like that? I know. I don't... What she's been through... Horrific. But you can't go round killing
people. She was clever. Clever enough to buy
her husband a new shirt an hour after
she'd killed him. Not clever enough to walk away. That's up to a jury now. With any luck they'll find
mitigating circumstances. O'Hallaran will kill you. Yeah. Not if the Lemon gets there first. Janine. Don't, Richard. Er, the Lemon wants you, boss. Right. Sir? "Release Mrs Tulley." Is there a part of that sentence
you don't understand? We've got the clothes, sir. And a confession. It'll fly if CPS like it. Right. Janine... I need all your documents:
evaluations, final budget. 5:30. . DC Chen, congratulations. All right?
Yeah. Same again? Erm... Yeah, go on. Nice one, boss.
Are you getting 'em in, boss? I might. Er, yeah. Can I have a coke,
please and... I could give you a call. Maybe we could do something
later in the week? I dunno. Not an outright no, then. I can wait. Night-night. ELEANOR: My dolly's not dead!
TOM: I like staying up late! Mum, the washing machine's leaking! Mum! subtitles by Deluxe
