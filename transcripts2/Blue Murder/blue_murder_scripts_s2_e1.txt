 I'm on my way. Tom? Tom? Anne Marie! No! Oh, god! Anne Marie! Oh my god! Somebody help me! - Yeah, ambulance? A little girl's been knockeddown outside Oak Lane Primary. It's-- Somebody call an ambulance! Detective Chief InspectorJanine Lewis reporting RTA outside Oak Lane Primary. Vehicle failed to stop, pedestrian injured. Blue Mercedes. Registration Victor 384 Zulu November Bravo. Heading south on Wilbur Road. Shit! How is she? They're taking her to hospital. Close to home. Yeah. Right. What, down here somewhere? Yeah, it's up there. Pulled her out of here. River authority guy reckons the body will have gone in upstream. Plus these two west. Right, OK. And that way is Stockport? That way is Stockport? OK, have we got a time frame?- Not yet. She's still reasonably intact, though. Only a day or two. Here. Looks like she was strangled. Bruising to the neck. The face is very badly damaged. From the water? - Don't think so. - ID? Nothing. No clothing. There's a wound to the upper right thigh. Surface skin removed. A tattoo? Or birthmark. So Janine, you'll check the rudder? Sir, I thought I'd be-- Yeah, I'd really liketo pursue the hit and run. No. The troops like to know who's in charge, Janine. You should lead on both. Now, obviously the murder is the priority. Oh, it was all right whileyou were on maternity leave. While you were off-- Yeah, well it's not you. I cleared three major cases-- It's him.Well, you will get there. He can't put it off forever. He was the same with me, remember? You will. You gonna stay here in a patty,or you gonna get on with it? Three-- Yes, all right! I'm gonna go to the postmortem. Get everyone in for two. [applause] Thanks very much. Afternoon, everyone. I'm DCI Janine Lewis. Some of you have worked with me before. I thought you looked familiar. Something's missing, though, innit? Still got yours. DI Richard Mayne. Sgts. Shap and Butchers. Any uncertainties about procedures, any questions, any problems, these guys are your first port of call. This will be our dedicated incident room. Right, what have we got? Unknown victim seen in the river at Cambrooke, just before 8:00 this morning. Now, our first priority is to find out who she is, our second toestablish where she was killed. It's likely the bodyentered the river to the west. So that narrows it down. We'll be searching all known access points of a 5 mile perimeter. Right. Post-mortem confirms she was in her early 20s. Malnourished as a child, and since. Pregnant. About two months. Signs of recent sexual activity. Cause of death, strangulation. Time of death, within 24 hours of her discovery. The trauma to the face occurredpost-mortem, as did the removal of the skin from the thigh. And I don't think he was collecting souvenirs. So someone wanted her incognito? Heavy rectangular object used on her face. Possibly a brick. The lab will do drug and toxin screening. We've also recovered some tissue from under her fingernails. We're doing DNA tests on that now. Anything else? - Yep. We've sent a detail throughthe system, missing from home. There's no matches yet. What about post-mortem? Anything that gives us a scene? No. A day in the river hasn't helped. Pathologists also noted some blue staining on the left ankle, knee, and hip. More tattoos? No. Here. It's too faint. There's no particular shape. A young womanstrangled, then mutilated. Who was she? Who wanted her dead? Now, I want a lot of helpfrom the public on this one. It's gonna be all over the papers, but you lot, discretion, please. I don't want you natteringabout this down the pub, or at the gym. And as usual, first 24 hours-- crucial. Thanks. RADIO: Stolen vehicle, blue Mercedes. Registration Victor 384 Zulu November Bravo reported on waste ground off Dunham Lane. Unit to attend. Uh, base? We got this. Oi. Sling it. Go on, get lost. Flambe. All this is going to be made up, innit? Better get forensics on it. They'll be lucky. They aren't getting prints off a cinder. Yeah, well, found your car, but it's a-- a write off. Aw, you're kidding? I'm only had it three months. I'm afraid your vehicle wasinvolved in a road traffic accident earlier this morning. Hit and run. What happened? A little girl got knocked down. She's in hospital. That's terrible. We're still trying of find the driver. Did you see anything at allwhen your vehicle was stolen? Not a thing. I was in the house when it happened, as well. The car was on the drive. Immobilizer. Crook Block. Everything. I couldn't believe it. - Boss? I think we got something on the murder. Several calls coming in about a woman who works works at the Top Cat club. Never showed up last night. I'll take a look. Bye. Place in town, owned by a Mr. Sulikov. Couple of callers wouldn'tleave their names, but we have one from another dancer there. Dancer? It's a lapdancing club. Come on. Somebody's got to do it. So what do you reckon? Boyfriend? Client? Someone who knew her, definitely. That's why he smashed her face up. You been here before? No. But they're all the same after a few bevvies. Yeah. What can I get ya? Mr. Sulikov here? No. This is his place? Yeah, but he's not here. The manager, then. Oh, god, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. They said they did everything they could. But it wasn't enough. It wasn't enough. Oh, god. Can I help you? Hello, hello. You two know each other? Detective Inspector Mayne, James Harper. Owner of the stolen vehicle involved in this morning's accident. Small world. Interview concluded already? Oh, just thought we'd wait for you, boss. Hiya, boss. I've got a name already. Rosa Milich. Polish. That's Mr. Harper. This is DCI Lewis. She's heading the investigation. Yes. Rosa. Rosa, Rosa. She didn't turn in for work yesterday. The description-- yeah. Could be her. I missed the news, butAndrea, one of our dancers, she rang in. Was Rosa married? Not that I know of. Can you put in a request to Poland? Dental records, ASAP. Can I have a look at her employment file? Yeah. The, um-- the girls are freelancers. They sort out their own tax,and that's the insurance. We pay public liability forthe premises, of course. Address? Um-- no, it doesn't seem-- mm. No. Sorry. Is that usual, to employ someone and not have their address? You don't own the business, do you? No. I'm just the manager. The owner's abroad. That's Mr. Sulikov. What's his first name? Conrad. So what else can you tell us about Rosa? Nice girl. Reliable. Turned up for her shifts on time. Never any problem. That's why it's so hard to understand. How'd you meet? Well, some of them, they get in a mess. Drinking. Drugs. Boyfriends. Or they're breaking the rules,putting themselves at risk. Top Cat's for dancing. Anything to make you thinkthere's a punter involved? I don't know what to think. All I'm saying is Rosa did her job. No fuss, no bother. Mr. Harper, I'm going tohave a word with some people. Have a look around. Give DI Mayne any detailsyou've got about Rosa. The last time you saw her,any regulars she danced for, any friends she had. See, death seems to be following you around. Did she have any distinguishing features? A tattoo on her leg. A rose. Her right leg. That's why I rang. Just-- well, it seemed to fit. Is it her? I think so. What was she like? Pretty quiet, really. Not shy. She didn't let people push her around, or out. Just never said much about herself. Did she have any problemswith clients, or anyone else? You were both working on Sunday? Yeah. Did you finish at same time? Who left first? I did. And you didn't see her again? Did she have a boyfriend? Do you know where she lived? No. Look-- we worked together. That's all. She were a nice kid, but I don't socialize with people from here. None of us do. It's just a job. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Always takes longer than I think. How are the kids? Fine. Oh, god. What a day. Well, it's hard to believe.Anne Marie. Yeah.Has Thomas said anything? You gonna tell him? Yeah. In the morning. They'll probably send a letteraround from school, though. How do you explain? I don't think I remember her. Yeah. Skinny, curly black hair. Her mother had a store at the summer fair. Oh, god, Pete. Could have been us. Tom. Right. Come on, you. Listen, this week's going to be all ours, and Connie needs her evenings off. It's not fair to ask you tolook after the baby all day long, and then be on tapfor babysitting at night. Well, I'm on done. What about Tina? Tina has her school. Harper's account checks out. Reported the car stolen at 10:00. Got a cab from home tothe Casino Royale in town, and had a meal in a restaurant there. I've been thinking-- Rosa, lack of records, no known place of residence? It's almost covering somethingup, like she's here illegally. Well, it wouldn't be the first time. Yeah. Waltz in off the street, gets a job. I'll get these. Cash in hand. Nod and wink. You know? Thank you. Ta. Yeah. Harper's passing the buck, blaming Sulikov. Who's also Polish. His only connection to Rosa. Have you spoke to Sulikov yet?- No. He lives over there. He might get shipped to us about this. Why couldn't he live in Turnery? - Boss. - Mm? We've had a witness on the hit and run. She saw two men get out and torch the car. Good descriptions. Age, height, and clothing. And one of them had red hair. Several possible matches, boss. Uh, Sal Hetherington. Clive Swann. And Lee Stone. Taken without owner's consent,carjacking, actual bodily harm, and sexual assault. Served18 months in Strangeways, and he got out last June. Known associate-- Jeremy Gleason. Monday, watched the box and went to bed. Tuesday? I got up late. After 10:00? Yeah, more like 2:00. And you, Mr. Gleason? Yeah. Yeah, what? I was here. We were both here. The thing is someone saw you. Both of you. Tuesday morning, not long after 9:00. On the waste ground, after the light. Can't. So you don't know anythingabout the theft of a Mercedes? Or the accident that resultedin the death of a young girl yesterday? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I saw it on the news. It's tragic. Yeah, can you put, um-- with sympathy? And you'll send this afternoon? Thanks. Bye bye. Yeah. Lee Stone. Guess what he works as? A designer? Hypnotherapist? A bouncer. That means he's good on the door. Oh. Is he, now? Butchers? Why would he steal your car, then? Search me. But if you do find out, you let me know. All right, love. That was great. I'll give you a bell. I'd book her. Rosa never turned up for work on Monday. What about Stone? It's his day off. But they both worked Sunday? Anything going on between him and Rosa? No. I'd have noticed. I don't like him around the girls. Why's that, then? He's a bit rough around the edges. Nasty mouth on him, too. They shouldn't have to put up with that. Anything physical? Once or twice, yeah. Harassment. Coping a feel. I told him, anymore of that, and he'd be out. Mr. Harper doesn'ttrust you with the girls. What? A gentleman like me? When did you last see Rosa? Sunday. At work. Did you ever have a relationship with her? No. She's not my type. I prefer 'em with big tits. Here are the records, boss. Yep. They're a match. Definitely Rosa Milich. At least we know we're talkingabout the right person. Thanks. Off pat, defintely shaking. Yours? Cocky. May I? Mr. Gleason, we've been having a very interesting talk to Lee Stone. Most helpful. Bit of a checkered past, Mr. Stone. You? You've never been in prison. Community service order, suspended sentence. We see a lot of that. You know, associates get dragged into things. Get out of their depth. What can you tell us about yesterday morning? Nothing. The car. The little girl. I don't know what you're on about. That little girl died last night. We won't stop till we've got a conviction. Case like this, feelings run high. Half eight, 9:00 AM. Where were you? At home. We've already got one witness saw you and Lee Stone running away from the car. There'll be others. Evidence, too, on the car. In the car. People make that mistake, don't they? They think, fire. All goes up in smoke. But the technology we've gotthese days is frightening. It's amazing. Who was driving? No comment. All you've got to dois look through the glass and see if the men you saw were there. You were happy to help us yesterday. That's all we're getting out you? No. I just don't want to get involved. But it's a little girl. Had to let him go. But they were good for it. They were seen leaving the car. But the witness won't stand up. We'll have to keep tabs on them. Put a couple of DCs outsidetheir place around the clock. Keep digging. Pull them in when I've got something stronger. We're getting plenty of press coverage. I'm sure someone will come forward soon. Meanwhile, I'm off to the Chinleys'. I'll come. Harper's not too pleasedto find Stone's down for nicking his car. What, he didn't put Rosa and Stone together? Well-- It's like juggling soot. Welcome back. Done a full day's work before I clock on. I knew I'd be stretched, but I didn't expect to be this full on so soon. How about dinner? My treat. First night we get free. Aw, Richard. Thanks. You'd have to stab me with afork just to keep me awake. My biggest ambition at the moment is eight hours unbroken sleep. Six. I'll let you know when shestarts sleeping through. Took Tom three years. [doorbell] Sit down. No, Chris. I'm, um-- I'm so sorry. Thanks for the flowers. Everybody's been brilliant, really. School. You got the car? Yeah. It's with forensics. And we're talking to somepeople who saw the vehicle, so we're making progress. Meaning? Chris. Um-- we've got some promising leads. What, you know who it was? It doesn't changeanything, anyway, does it? Even if they convict them, she still-- I want something good to come from this. Something good? What possible good? That bastard's still out there, drawing breath. You lot talk about promisingleads, and making progress, and-- - It's not just talk. Hey. We're on to something. Walkies. RADIO: Two men answering descriptions of suspects seen on Bradbury Streetnear Holden Lane Junction, heading west. Unit responding. Aye. Right, just fan out. Oh, sweet Jesus. No. If Stone did both killings, they've both very different MOs. Here we've got a very professional shooter, with no attempt to hide the body. With Rosa we've got a strangulation, then efforts to disguise her. Different motives. Yeah. Rosa-- maybe he lost his cool, and killed her over some sexual rejection. Whatever. Yeah, this is more like an execution. There is somebody else with a cast iron motive. Chris Chinley. Couple of hours ago, he wasseen near Gleason's place. Chinley? How would he know where our suspects were? Unless-- I don't have anything to hide. This isn't easy. Earlier this evening, youwere seen in northern moore. On Mullins Road. Can you tell us exactlywhat you were doing there? Just driving. Why there? What time did you get back? What's going on? During the course of our inquiry, we've been able to identify two suspects. They've both been kept under observation. They both live on Mullins Road. Now one of them has been killed. Well, it wasn't me. I was there, yeah. I went to the flat. I never even got out of the car. Who told you? You just sat in the car? Where the hell would I get a gun from, anyway? Who said it was a gun? It's been on the radio. A man with gunshot wounds. One you said. That's him, isn't it? Will you be prepared totake a gunshot residue test and provide your clothingfor forensic examination? And if I don't? Jeremy Gleason. Someone in this room leakedcrucial identifying information to a man half deranged with grief. We don't know yet who pulled thetrigger, but whether or not it was Chris Chinley, I willnever accommodate such a serious breach of discipline. We are a team. A stunt like this reflectson every other person in this room. I expect whoever jeopardizedthis investigation to have the basic guts to own up. You know where my office is. OK. We've got three cases. We'll take new informationon them one by one. Jeremy Gleason, murder. First suspect, Chris Chinley. He was in the area at the time, intending to go after Lee Stone. Claims he bottled out. He's agreed to a gunshot residue test, and his clothes are with the lab. Second suspect, Lee Stone. All forces are on lookout for him, and we're contacting all knownassociates, and checking places where he may have holed up. Next case, Rosa Milich. Murder. The DNA profile from the material under her nails should be with us tomorrow. Don't hold your breath. Rosa was an illegal immigrant,but still, someone should know where she was living. We're doing a paper search on Conrad Sulikov, the owner of the club. We also need to speak to LeeStone about this one, as well. He works at a club, and hasa history of sexual violence. Finally-- hit and run. Here we have sightings of the Mercedes, and there's a patternemerging, with the odd rogue report, which is out of sync. Where's that, Butchers? Um-- Burnage. [inaudible] Murkle would have been spotted everywhere from [inaudible] to Land'sEnd before we're done. But the fire damage to the car means that we've got nothing concretefrom forensics to place Stone or Gleason at the wheel. But we've got morewitnesses coming forward, and they're alldescribing those two men. OK. Stone's the key. Those of you with sources, find him. [knocking] Yeah? Boss, have you got a minute? It's about Ian. He should be here, not you. Tell him to see me himself. Boss, he can be a bit of a prat, but we both know he's straight as a dart. Everyone-- Shut it. I'm not interested in excuses. I just think, given the situation-- Yeah, the situation is he's a police officer. And his brother was killed in a hit and run, and they never got anyone for it. Discipline, Janine. If you lose that-- My team know where they stand. I'll be dealing with the culprit this afternoon. Who is it? Well, I have a pretty clear idea, but until I've spoken to the officer directly-- Not the most auspicious start. Maybe you're right. Maybe I should have let Mayne lead. Give you a chance to readjust. Have we finished here, sir? Lots to do. [knocking] JANINE: Yep? Boss? Did you really want to say Chriss Chinley charged with murder? Does it make anything better for you? For them? You should have told me. You should never have beenassigned to this case. Why didn't you say anything? If people can't trust us, thenwe might as well go home now. You don't know how lucky you are. Chinley's clear on gunshot residue tests. His clothes are fine. I left a note on error ofjudgment on your record, but you'll keep your stripes. Now, you pull a stunt like this ever again, and you're suspended. Thank you. I know it was wrong, whateverthe reasons, but I just-- thanks. [knocking] Yeah? Forensics on Gleason. Hang on. Hang on, there's blue marks on his knees. Match the traces found in Rosa's. Chemical analysisindicates industrial dye. The blue dye works in Lower Broughton. It's closed down now, butkids used to fall in the water and come out blue. Come out? It's a river. Kneeling here, to shove her in. Gets dye on his jeans. - Yeah. But on Rosa the stain is all down her left side. Ankle, knee, hip. Abrasions. Kind of like she'd been wrapped in bin liners, and they're torn here. There's no sign of a struggle. Nothing that fits with the state of her face. No-- she was brought here, not killed here. Let's have a look inside. Cheers. A tire print. Once that's clearly recent-- [inaudible] Maybe a match. But I know what my money will be on. The merc. Blood. Right. Now we need to find out if it's hers. Hey, Charlotte hasstarted doing bubble thing. Yeah? Yeah. I'd forgotten that bit. I think she's getting more like Michael. Moody and hormonal? Well, he spoke today. A whole sentence. Could I have some money? No, it was, um-- I need some trainers. I'll sort him out. I am ready for bed. Janine-- I've been thinking, and, um-- well, I seem to be spendingmost of the time here and, um-- well, things-- I know aftereverything that's happened, you probably don't, or you won't, but-- when all's said and done, 18 years, and-- I still-- Don't you think it's a bit late? Since we had Charlotte. I was there for the others. Nights. Everything. And-- well, it's not just missing them. It's you. And Tina. Maybe-- I was wrong. I'm sorry, Pete. I can't cope with this now. Tell 'em it's Friday at the cookery. - New technology. - What do you need? Connie's donut. It's in the fridge. [phone ringing] Yeah? Butchers, boss. The blood from the car-- it's Rosa's. Right. What if a punter wantsthat little something extra? Won't get it here. Oh, come on, Andrea. You got some fella hasslingyou, wants the full English. French. Polish. Whatever. I dance. That's all. What about the others? Some of the girls must want the extra cash. What about Rosa? She ever make any special arrangements? I don't know. I don't think so. And what if someone won'ttake no for an answer? Like you? Lee Stone on the phone for you, boss. Mr. Stone? Gleason. I didn't kill him. I didn't kill anybody. I need protection. A new identity. The lot. Where are you? Can you do it? Can you get me a safe house? Yeah, it's possible. You'd need to come in and talk to me. Where are you, Lee? You're tracing this call, aren't you? No, no, listen-- wait, please-- Shit. Lost him. He wants witness protection. He'll ring back. Andrea, we're not interested in soliciting or living on immoral earnings. Your friend Rosa's murder-- that's what I'm asking about. I never gave you it. It's all very hush hush. Now, your bog standard massage parlor, there'd be an ad in the paper,number in the phone book. What, so these are illegals? - Like Rosa? - Yeah. Stevie-- - Yeah? Can you get in touch with Poland? Try and find out some more on Conrad Sulikov. Criminal record, current activities? That sort of thing? Will do, boss. OK, what are we waiting for? The address. Oh. You can be our Trojan horse. Donkey. New client. After the full monty, hm? Well, give a lad a little privacy. Hello, I've got an appointment. It's, uh-- Richard. Has there been any trouble? Any bother? Anyone with a score to settle? Do you know this man? He brought us here. He drives the van. From Poland? No, here in the UK? Mr. Sulikov? Transport's arranged. I sent everyone down to the station. Soco's on the way. We're still trying to establish where Rosa was killed. She went out. She never came back here. Did she have a boyfriend? Only Mr. Harper. Harper? Rosa and Harper? Yes. He takes care of this place. Harper. I knew it. - Harper wants his solicitor.- Good. He knows we've got something. [inaudible] coming for Stone. You know? Yeah, someone must know where he is. - More on Sulikov. - Yeah? Polish authoritiescertainly know who he is. He started off his illustriouscareer as a teenager, smuggling cigarettes and alcohol. - Yeah. More money in human cargo these days. Yeah. I'll get Poland to have a look at his place. See if he's still there. Yeah. Emphasize we don't want him tipping off. Ask 'em for a photo. You've got rather a lot of explaining to do. Why don't you start with Rosa Milich? She danced at the club. Yeah, all right. You can cut the bullshit. We know about your relationship with her. We know you were her pimp. I liked her. We hit it off. She couldn't settle, though. Now, some of the girls, they-- they get used to being ontheir game, but she hated it. So I let her work at the club instead. But she still wasn't happy. She began to talk about going back. She had nothing over their. Family? I said I'd try and find a way. Smooth things over. And then on-- on Sunday night, she's on about it again, getting in a state. I told her-- maybe I could persuade Mr. Sulikov to let her go. Tell him she was seriouslyill, or something. But I needed some time. I told her to wait. I thought I'd got through to her. She was pregnant. Was it yours? She said it was. You were close to Rosa, but maybe a baby wasn't part of the plan? It's convenient for you, her disappearance. No, it wasn't like that. You were having sex with her,were the father of her child, yet when she's murdered, you say nothing. I was scared. She was dead. Why don't you tell us whatreally happened, Mr. Harper? You killed her, didn't you? No. I didn't touch her. I don't know what you want me to say. Well, the truth would be a start. What about something like this? You did see her on Monday. She came to you, you had sex. She told you she wasthinking of running away. You knew you had to stop her. You argued. You put your hands around her throat. How long did it take? You wrapped her in a bin bag. You broke her face. Her face? I didn't kill her. I wouldn't have hurt her.It wasn't me. Then who was it? I can't. It's not safe. - Who? My client has answered your questions. He's told me nothing yet! Who was it? I can't! Fine. OK. That's the way you want to play it. Interview terminated. All right. All right. It-- it was Sulikov. Sulikov. But I-- I can't-- it was a warning. Look, I'm sorry. I can't-- he'll kill me. What do you mean, a warning? It was a warning to the girls. To me. I don't know if he killed her,or if he paid someone else. He rang me up on Tuesday morning. Sulikov? He said I should have known better, helping myself to the merchandise. He said he'd taken care of Rosa. I didn't know what he meant at first. She hadn't been found then. She never deserved it. He said my-- my car had made a lovely blaze. Anymore problems, he said,and it would be my house next, with me in it. Your car was used to carry the body? To teach me a lesson. I didn't know any of this would happen. Honestly. For the tape, DCI Lewis is now leaving the room. Who killed her? Sulikov. And his bully boys. Now no one else will try to get away. What about Harper? He let her dance in the club, and she thought he was a prince. But he will never go against his boss. He's not a brave man. She loved him. And he just screwed her. Just like they all do. She was thinking of names. Little clothes. Could he have killed her? Harper? When you said bully boys? Lee Stone. Sulikov started out with a twoup, two down brothel in Leeds. He's got a bloody empire now. He's got places in Leeds,Liverpool, Birmingham, London. Clubs, escort agencies. He's bringing in girls every month. Some of them working, someof them paying more so they can disappear. He needs people like Stone. For muscle? No limits. This phone call after your car was stolen-- where was Sulikov calling from? His mobile. I don't know exactly where. Poland? No. No, he's-- he's been over in the UK this-- Where's he staying? Please. I can't. Now, your silence has done enough damage. Answer the question. He'll know I've told you. You've no idea what he's like. We'll be discreet. Discreet? He's a maniac. He'll kill me. We've got enough to arrest him. We'll put him behind bars. Now answer the question,or I'll put you there, too. Your choice. The Midland Hotel. He's probably left by now. Yeah, Mr. Sulikov. He checked in Wednesday evening.- Wednesday? Not earlier? Is he still here? - That's right. Polish gentleman. Is he in his room now? No. He must be out. We, um-- we need to see his room. Travels light. There's no point mulling about here. I'll wait downstairs, boss. He didn't check in until Wednesday. Where was he Monday night? The night Rosa was killed. Yeah. Nothing from the airport. Maybe he drove? We'll check the ports. Yeah. Get Harper's statement. DNA swab of [inaudible]. Return here tomorrow. The minute Sulikov gets in thatlift, I want to know about it. Yeah. She was due in for her developmental review today at 2:30, and I'm terribly sorry. I meant to cancel the appointment, but-- yeah. Would you press on my apologiesto Dr. Edwards, please? Yeah, if you could tell Dr. Edwards I'll make another appointmenttomorrow-- thanks very much. Start the car. And do exactly as I say. Hello. DI Mayne. Richard. It's Pete. Oh. Is Janine there? No. She's gone. She's not answering her mobile. Well, she left-- she left about an hour ago. An hour ago? She should be back by now. I'll put a call out. We'll find her. See ya. STONE: I'm not going down for murder. You'll have to have a word with them, and you'll have to get me some protection. It doesn't work like that. Now, I don't think you'vegot much choice, do you, lady? Please just put the gun down. I can't do anything untilyou put the down gun. Please. - Shut up. Put the gun down! [gunshot] Are you going to listen to me? Yeah. Sulikov said the girl had died of an overdose. We had to take the car and get rid. We didn't know he'd killed her. Damn. Well, a job like that-- putting her in the water-- got all wired up. Needed to burn some of the adrenaline off. We didn't kill her. You drove over Anne Marie. Just shut up and listen! When you let us out-- I rang Sulikov. We had to get right away. He just goes ballistic. He starts yabbering on in Polack. But he knew we'd beenogled hanging around here. He says he's going back to Poland. He said he'll-- he'll get us over the Channel. Now, there's some warehousesnear us, and this old tunnel. He said he'll meet us at the other end. We go all the way in. He's down the stairs at the other end, shouting for us to hurry up. Then he opens up, Terminator style. Jez goes down. I just legged it. Soon as he knows where Iam, he'll be after me next. You've got to get me protection. You'll turn queen's evidence? I don't know. It's a two way street. Yeah, but he'll get around it. You'll never get him into court. He'll drop out of sight somewhere in Europe. Then-- then where will I be, if there's no trial? No, no, no. No, we have testimony, thestuff we've got off Harper. We have a strong case. We know where he is. We've got to act quickly,but absolutely nothing happens till you move that gun! Do you know how hard itis to even think straight with you pointing that at me? Well, I don't know you'regoing to do what you say-- You don't! You don't! But I'm being straight with you. Now, if you give us the information you've got on Sulikov, then I will get you into witness protection. As long as it all adds up. So-- so what happens now? Now I'll take you in. Oh-- oh-- it's a set up! - No! No, no, no! Listen-- listen, let me talk to them. MAYNE: Janine-- - You set met up! No, I didn't! Richard! Richard! Back off! Back off! Tell them all to get out of here! Janine, are you sure you're not hurt? We've had reports of gunfire. Fine. Never better. Mr. Stone is coming in, but only as long as you call off the cavalry. MAYNE: But Janine-- We do not need an escort. Mr. Stone will require legal services and complete protection. We will be treating him was a valuable witness. Now clear the area! We'll have to cuff you. They won't let us in unlessyou're in restraints. Where's the gun? It's in the glovecompartment, in a nappy sack. Don't. Barry, glovebox. Right. How'd he get into the car? He's a professional carthief, among other things. He could get into anything. I'm all right, Pete. You'd better go. We can't. After everything-- It's too late. Kids. We've still got the kids, Pete. We're lucky. Janine, I'm so sorry. Bye, Ellie. Bye, Tom. Hey. Where are you going? Home. See you Sunday. Fly me, Dad. Come on, then. Hey. Sulikov rang here at 7:15 on Monday. What did he say? He said-- he said there was a problem. He said, um-- he said one of the girls had OD'd, and we had to get rid of the body. He said I could get the car, 8:00, near these units in Burnage. You got a car from Harper's, didn't you? No. No, it was Harper's car,but he weren't too pleased. You didn't get it from his please? I just told you, theindustrial units near Burnage. The keys were in the ignition,the docs was in the glove box, and the body was in the boot. Then what? Then we drove it to the old dye works, and got rid of the body. And there's a purple. And a yellow one for me. And a purple. JANINE: Oh, Tom. - Wasn't me. It was Frank. [phone ringing] Frank. Frank, you'll be in big trouble now. Yeah? Yeah, Richard? Have you got Sulikov? No, he hasn't been back to the hotel yet. But Stone's version stands up. Negative on the DNA. The skin sample from underneaththe nails doesn't match. Wasn't his. It must be Sulikov's. Something's a bit off. Stone says they didn't steal the Mercedes outside Harper's house. He claims they picked it upnear some industrial units in Burnage about 8:00. Sulikov told them where it was. Burnage? Wasn't there a sighting there that didn't fit? Yeah. That was Butcher's rogue report. JANINE: None of this makes any sense. Sulikov kills her, there's that[inaudible] with the bin bags, then what? He steals Harper's car,puts the body in the boot, and then leaves it for Stone to pick up? I mean, why on earth would he do that? Teaching Harper a lesson, like he said. Yeah, but why do it himself? He'd have to leave the body to go to Harper's to steal the car. Unless-- unless she waskilled at Harper's house. MAYNE: Maybe they're in it together? Frank, now, he's coming up.He's coming up. Frank, I'm watching you. Oh, god, Richard. The photo of Sulikov. Has it arrived? Right. Yeah. Conrad Sulikov. Born in-- yeah. Here. English mother. Polish father. Moved there when he was seven. Shit. Cheeky bugger. Harper's cleared out. Yeah. James Harper or Conrad Sulikov? Which one? 2110. Aw, shit. Delayed? How long? Everyone always dealt with him as Harper. Sulikov was just like, there in the background. But no one never met him. Might have all been hunkydory if the boys had got rid of the car straight away. But the hit and run put pay to that. Yeah, he wants sure Stone and Gleason-- well, Stone gets away. - Yeah. So that's when he triedto throw us off the scent, by booking the hotel room. We might have been sitting there still, like a load of wallies, waiting for him. The way he made us drag it outof him-- which he credited. Shap, Butchers, you stay here. You other guys cover that other exit, in case he comes out of there. Mr. Sulikov? Conrad Sulikov, I am arresting you on suspicion in the murder ofRosa Milich and Jeremy Gleason. You are such a show off. Well, if you got it-- didn't do so bad yourself. We need to seal his place off. See what we can find. A murder scene would be nice. DNA will clinch it. Oh, that can wait till the morning. He's gotta have his [inaudible] rights. It's more than I'll get. Why didn't he just let her go? Marta was right. He killed her to protecthimself, as a warning to her more. I mean, back home, with a baby? His baby? It'd be beyond his control. Do you think she ever knew? About Sulikov? No. How could she? He'd never have told her. No, she was just another girlwith a way of making money.
