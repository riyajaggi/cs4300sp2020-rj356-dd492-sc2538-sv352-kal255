 Sade: I don't know. (laughing) Guess we can cross my office off the list. Now the only room we haven't had sex in is the nursery. Guess little Charli is napping in the hallway tomorrow. (Sade chuckles) (contented sigh) I love seeing you all lit up. I love feeling all lit up. ♪♪

 I've always wanted to live in Paris. Ah. (speaking French) (continues speaking French) Get out. You, you speak French? Oui, je parle français. Yeah. How are you still single? I could ask the same of you. Well, my problem is when things get serious, I tend to freak out and pick fights to sabotage the relationship. Classic fear of intimacy issues. How about you? When I feel someone start to pull away, then I bail before they can bail on me.

 So our issues fit together like perfect puzzle pieces. That is... that is so romantic! (Sean laughs) Sean: This is great. Oscar: Oh, look at those beautiful teeth. Sean: You have a nice smile. Oscar: I was just thinking that about myself too. (Sean and Oscar laugh) Okay, tell me something I don't know about you yet. Um... oh, my father is Canadian. So I have dual citizenship. Oh my God, you are so lucky. You have the option to flee if that transphobic dumpster fire gets reelected. Sean: I'll just marry you and take you with me. Oscar: Oh wow. Sean: So, favorite travel destinations? If one could be with someone... ‐(Oscar laughs) ‐...to walk down a street. Elle! Elle, wait. Come here. Come here. Meet Sean! ‐Come here. ‐(quietly): Okay. Elle, this is Sean. Sean, this is Elle, my best friend. ‐Hi. ‐Sean: Wow! You are gorgeous. She also has an amazing voice, thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Well, I, uh, should go check the CDC website, to see if they have any updates. So it was really nice meeting you. Sean: It was very nice to meet you. Bye. (sighs) Isn't she beautiful? She's, like, my soulmate. Yeah. I'm starting to think I should be dating the both of you. Oh, are we, are we officially dating now or ... I mean, I'm not virtually seeing anybody else. Are you? No. (door closes) (handle creaks, shower running) (sensual music playing) ♪♪ (handle creaks, shower stops) ‐Oh. ‐(laughing awkwardly) ‐Hey. ‐Um... I w‐‐ I was just admiring your lemons on your tree! It's... It's a very prolific fruiter. (chuckles) What are you reading? Oh, um, it‐‐ it's called "The Course of Love." Alain de Botton. Yeah. You know him? Yeah. His book "On Love" is one of my favorites. ‐I'm Adam. ‐Elle. So, Elle, how's your quarantine going? You know, just reading a lot, catching up on some shows‐‐ Ogling your neighbor's lemons. What can I say? I appreciate a good lemon. Well, enjoy the book. Hey, maybe I can borrow it when you're done. Yeah. Yeah. Um, for sure. Okay, uh, have a nice day. Nice‐‐ Oh! ‐Are you okay? ‐Uh, yep. All good. Ahh! Okay. Seems... Oopsie. (breathing heavily, punching bag) (Velcro rips) (sniffs) ‐Hey. ‐Hey. Hope it's okay I put the bag back up. You look good. You look like you've lost some weight. Thanks. I've been doing Pilates. (chuckles) ‐That's new. ‐Well, you look good too. Thanks. I guess the breakup diet suits both of us. What are you working on? I am doing research on Venice. I'm writing a travel piece for Condé Nast. Congratulations. That's big. Thank you. It is. I'm really excited. I'm hoping it doesn't get canceled, though, because the numbers in Italy are terrible. Yeah, it's awful. When are you supposed to go? June. Well, I'm sure it'll be over by then. Ugh, I hope so. ‐I can't wait. ‐Yeah. It's a great way for you to jump start your career again. ‐It's amazing. ‐Thank you. Has Sophie left her room today? No, I don't think so. We should do something to cheer her up? ♪ Good God, she look good! ♪ (funky music playing) ♪ Gonna give 'em a little soul... ♪ What are you doing? We're having a dance party! Do you have any idea how lame you look right now? Come on. You used to love our dance parties! Yeah. When I was ten. Hey, you remember "The Whip"? ‐How about "The Nae‐Nae"? ‐Dad. ‐Dad. ‐ "Frozen Mannequin." ♪ Give it to me now! ♪ Hey, do you all still dab? (laughs) Dad. Please, stop. Some things are best left forgotten. Like, all of 2016. And... this. Come on, baby. ‐No. ‐Come on, dance! (music continues) ‐Hi. ‐Hey! You hungry? I can make you something to eat. I'm fine. I just ate. Thanks for letting me stay here for a while. I won't be long. You're welcome to stay as long as you want to. And while you're here, I could use some help getting the yard together for our 50th anniversary party. And your father's sculpture's been sheltering in place so long they can use some attention too. Yeah. Anything you need. Uh... Can you do me a favor... not tell Dad I lost my job? You should call your father. My father should call me. (melancholy music playing) ♪♪ Oh, I, I left you a mask back there. Thanks, Mom. How 'bout you, girl? You looking all sexy in your slip there. How's it going with Niles? Oh, he's so freakin' cute. I just wanna eat him up. Girl, he does this thing where he whistles through his nose when he eats. I know, it sounds weird, but it's so freakin' adorable. Mmm, enjoy it, girl. This is the honeymoon phase. That's the best part. I will say... the baby‐making phase... ain't bad either. Oh, tell me about it. Please. Well, you know, it's been an adjustment. I mean, with James being gone so much the last few years, this is the first time that he's been home this much since Charli was born. But it's good, right? Yeah, I mean... especially now that we get the chance to do this whole baby thing differently. I mean, I was alone for so much of my pregnancy with Charli and then after. We've being flirty and sexy, and I feel like we're more connected than ever. Ahhh! I love that! Thanks. Me too. Love it for you too, girl. Did I tell you Sean and I did a dance challenge? And he's actually really good. Oh, and I made him a mask just like yours. Isn't that cute? Ah! Oh, our kids are going to be so gorgeous. Maybe we'll, like, mix our sperm together. (gasps) Or maybe there's a way to merge the DNA from two sperms. I don't know, science will figure it out. Oh, and he speaks French. You barely even know him and now you're gonna get married and have babies and move to Canada? (slams door) (dishes clatter) Okay, Elle, I'm sorry, okay? I got, I got so wrapped up into Sean. I, I don't want you to feel abandoned because I met someone. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Why aren't you attracted to me? ‐What do you mean? ‐You said that lately you've been feeling sexually attracted to women. So... why not me? I mean, you're, you're my best friend. Well, I'm in love with you. And I want to be the one to... have babies with you and get married to you and go to Paris and move to Canada! (sighs) But of course. Of course. I think, I think ‐you're beautiful and‐and‐and you're sexy. ‐No, no. It's fine. It's really, um... You're right. We're best friends. And now that I've said it out loud, it does sound a little weird, you know. Like when you start saying the same word over and over again, it doesn't even sound like a real word anymore. Like orange. Or soap. Soap. ‐Soap. ‐(cell phone ringing) And look who it is? Sean is calling you. So you should answer. And... tell him I said hi. (cell phone continues ringing) (panting) (chuckles) Reporter (on phone): Another story unfolding. There's growing outrage over chilling video showing the deadly shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black man in Georgia. Two white men, a father and son, both with guns confronting him while he was jogging. We warn you, the video is disturbing. ‐(gunshot) ‐Oh! ‐(door slams shut) ‐(Elle sighs) (softly): I'm so stupid. (sobbing) Hey. Oh, hi! (laughs) You okay? Yeah. Uh... It's just a sad ending. You wanna talk about it? No. I'm fine. Um, here's the book. Sorry. I, I should have disinfected that first. No worries. Well, enjoy the read. Thanks. Oh! Look what we just got in the mail. Oh my God, it's Mrs. Aldicott. That's so cute. I didn't know you were still in touch with her. She was my favorite teacher. I know. She was my favorite too. I volunteered in Nanda's classroom long after you graduated from the elementary school. Paul: Can I see? Wow! Fifty years. Imagine that. How long have you guys been married? ‐Um... ‐We're... ‐Sarah: Twenty‐four... ‐Paul: Twenty‐five... ‐Paul: ...years this summer. ‐Sarah: ...last summer. Okay, so, you're almost halfway there. I thought Jordan and I were gonna get married someday. Both: Really? Now he's on Instagram acting like nothing ever happened. Well, I'm sure glad that Insta wasn't around when I was young and getting my heart trampled. ‐Insta? ‐Paul: That's what they call it. I should know. I'm on the "Gram." Oh, he's on the "Gram." (laughing) Apparently. Did anyone ever break up with you before you met Mom? Oh my God, of course! Once. (laughter) When Tina Goodman broke my heart in high school, I thought my, my life was over. ‐Sarah: Really? ‐Paul: Yeah. So I, uh, snuck in her backyard, I climbed up the tree. I wanted to knock on her window ‐and beg for her to take me back. ‐Sophie: Uh‐huh. But when I reached out to the window, I slipped and I fell, and I crushed her dad's grill. Oh no! I love that story. (laughing) Well, did she take you back? No. But she did sign my cast. Oh! What about you, Mom? Jamie Dewitt. ‐ "No wit." ‐(Sarah laughs) ‐Sophomore year of college. ‐Sophie: Mm‐hmm. He broke up with me right before finals. Yeah. And I called his mother, who I'd never met before, ‐and cried to her on the phone... ‐No. ...and told her that she had to convince him he was making a mistake and to take me back. Oh my God. ‐She hung up on me. ‐No! ‐(sighs) ‐That is brutal. ‐I know. ‐I, I don't think I could ever recover. Oh, I didn't think I would. But I did, and I realized that he was definitely not the person for me. So how did you and Dad know that you were right for each other? I don't know if it was... if it was one thing or one moment. We just... knew. (light music playing) So how was your day? Charles: (on laptop) Well, same as yesterday. But better now I'm talking to you. ‐(chuckles) ‐Charles: So, what's for dinner tonight, huh? My chicken and garlic mashed potatoes. Mmm. ‐I know how to hurt you. ‐Oh man. Oh boy, I sure miss your cookin', I tell you. I know you do. (chuckles) So what else you been up to? Just trying to get that yard cleaned up before the party. Don't go lifting anything too heavy, now. I won't. Dedrick is gonna help me. I've never known Dedrick to offer a hand. (chuckles) Well, things have changed. You should call him. He's your son. Well... my son should call me. Yeah. (strumming guitar) (doorbell rings) ♪♪ Adam: When life gives you lemons, make lemon martinis. Also, since you finished your book, I thought you might like this one. If you ever want to talk or discuss the book, give me a call or just shout out the window. Adam. Sade: Hey, girls. So I talked to my OB today, and she's already got me on prenatal vitamins. So... (chuckles) Guess we're doing this. Ah! (call ends) Oh. Here. Here you go. You spoke to Dr. Likari today? Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that she thought it was safe for us to be trying to get pregnant now. Sorry, should I have waited for you? I just got really excited. ‐That's okay. ‐Okay. Woman 1: (on phone) I'm so happy for you guys! You're making a baby. And what the hell else is there to do? You can say that because you don't have a three‐year‐old. New York, you see, there's 824 deaths in a single day. Just getting blasted by this thing. God, it's awful. I hear cases are up here too. ‐Mmm. ‐Woman 2: (on phone) Girl, I am so excited! I can't wait to be an auntie again. (chuckles) So I was thinking maybe we should move Charli into the guest room. Why? She loves her room. Yeah, well, when the baby comes, we'll want to have the nursery close to us. Unless we have them share a room, but I feel like that would be hard. Well, you know, the good news is we have, um, plenty of time to think about it. Charli's going to love her little brother so much. I feel like we're gonna have a boy! But, I mean, a girl would be great too. A sister for Charli. I love my sister. Are you okay? Um... exactly how many people have you told about this? (chuckles) Just my core group of friends and family, and my yoga teacher. You told your yoga teacher? Well, she's my friend, and she's also a doula. I'm just trying to wrap my mind around the fact that the whole world knows we might be... thinking about trying to get pregnant? Uh, we might be trying? I thought we were trying. I thought we were having a conversation about trying. A conversation without birth control? I'm just thrown off by you telling everybody. This was supposed to be our thing. Between us. Something intimate and sexy. A little dangerous. Didn't know it was gonna get added to a whole... to‐do list. Just puts a whole lot of pressure on something that could have been fun. So, are you having doubts? I just don't think you and I are on the same page about... Okay. Well, I don't want you to feel uncomfortable, so... um... maybe we should just table the conversation. And if I'm already pregnant, then... we'll just figure it out. I'm gonna go get Charli up from her nap. Why did we stop having family dinners? I guess Sophie got busy with her clubs and her friends and you were working all the time. ‐And you got tired of cooking. ‐No. I didn't get tired of cooking. There was just nobody at home to cook for. I think being forced to slow down and stay home isn't such a bad thing. You up for another bottle? Yeah. Sure. I'll get it. It's all right. You don't know where I keep the good stuff anymore. Ah. ‐(cell phone ringing) ‐Um... Hey, I, uh... I have to take this call. Sarah: Okay. (ringing continues) ‐Hey. ‐Are you sleeping with your wife, Paul? No. I saw the photo. Sophie wanted to sleep in our bed. What was I supposed to do? Well, what about our bed, Paul? The one that I'm in alone, every single night? It's a pandemic. People are supposed to be together. Unless of course you're single. But I'm not single. Yet I'm still alone. What do you want me to do? Tell your daughter that you and your wife have separated. It's not that simple. What do you mean, it's not that simple? It could not be more simple. She's 19, she can take it. Unless of course you're not sure you want to leave your nagging ex‐wife for your very hot, supportive girlfriend! Look, this whole pandemic thing, it will be over in a couple of weeks. You know what else might be over in a couple of weeks? Us. (call disconnects) (sighs) I found this amazing new local vineyard. I think you're gonna love it. ‐Hey... Sarah... ‐Yeah. ...uh, work called. So, um, I have some work I gotta do. Can we do a raincheck on the bottle? Yeah. Okay. Uh, dinner was great. Uh, I, I got the dishes. Sure. Thanks. You're welcome. (melancholy music playing) ♪♪ Who do you think she is? Kaia: (on phone) I don't know, maybe a friend from college? She doesn't look like a friend! We've been together since sophomore year, and now he won't answer my texts or calls. But he posts this? Instagram is pretend. You need to get out, girl. You know, Nate's throwing a Corona‐themed party tonight. He's gonna have AMFs in little syringes so we can give each other "the vaccine." You should come. I mean, what about quarantine? We're all gonna wear masks. Plus people our age, like, can't really get it. And even if we do, we just, like, get diarrhea. Which is like a natural way to lose weight. I don't think that's true. And besides, people our age can get it, and we can give it to our parents or grandparents. Then you can stay six feet away from everyone. Come on, this is a great opportunity for you to flex your hot single life via your Insta story and make Jordan jealous. That's true. Okay. Okay. But I have to wait till my parents fall asleep so I can sneak out. Awesome! I'll be the one in the Gucci mask! (cell phone ringing) ‐Adam: Hello. ‐Hey. It's Elle, your neighbor. Oh, um, there you are. (chuckles) Uh, I just wanted to thank you for the basket and the book. Oh yeah. I hope you haven't read it already. No, not yet. But lucky for you, I like to drink and read about sad people. So, uh, what do you do when you're not sheltering at home? I'm a singer/songwriter. And before you ask, "Anything I've ever heard?" No. Unless you've seen the Freedom Form YouTube sanitary pad ads which I proudly wrote the jingle for. Oh, that's you? Yeah, I love those. (laughs) Yeah, thank you. So, what do you do besides shower outdoors? Oh, uh, I flip houses, to make a living. Bathroom's under construction. But I'm also a writer. Or trying to be, anyway. Uh, before you ask, no, nothing you've read. I guess I'm still in the struggling stage. ‐I feel that. ‐I don't know, I feel like I should be, you know, using this time to write some great novel or something, but, I don't know, I've got major COVID brain. Yeah, me too! I have been trying to write this song for weeks, and I just can't get it out. Well, hopefully inspiration strikes soon. For both of us. Yeah. I hope so. Well, if you want to talk about the book, uh, you know where I live. And shower. ‐Yes. And shower. ‐(laughs) Well, yeah, uh... ‐...thank you again. ‐Careful with the‐‐ Right. Yes. ‐...patio furniture. ‐Thank you. (laughing) All right. Bye. (laughs) (theme music playing)
