 Hot shower guy. Unfortunately for me, I think he's straight. Elle: Thank you for the basket and the book. Oh yeah, hope you haven't read it already. When things get serious, I tend to freak out and pick fights to sabotage the relationship. So our issues fit together like perfect puzzle pieces. That is so romantic! I don't want you to feel abandoned because I met someone. Well, I'm in love with you. You're right. Now that I've said it out loud,

 it does sound a little weird. I'm writing a travel piece for Condé Nast. Congratulations. That's big. Jordan just broke up with me. I don't wanna sleep alone. Can I sleep with you guys? Sarah: Maybe we should just tell her we're separated and you don't live here anymore. James: What about Dedrick? Have you heard from him? I don't want him taking advantage of you and Daddy at this time. I sent out the last of the invites to our anniversary party. I wish I was there to help. Dedrick is gonna help me.

 - Let's do this. - Let's do what? Sade: Let's make a baby. Reporter: The deadly shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black man in Georgia. - (gunshot) - Oh. I talked to my OB today. Guess we're doing this. I'm just thrown off by you telling everybody. So, are you having doubts? James: I just don't think you and I are on the same page. Did you watch his TikTok? He, he saw her on her roof doing yoga, thought she was cute, so he sent a drone over with his phone number. So romantic. Why film the whole thing and post it on social media? So we could all salivate over this quarantine meet-cute! Duh! Or was it so that he could maybe get a million likes and boost his brand? Yeah. Sean, 2020 has been a dumpster fire so far. Please don't ruin this for me. What the world needs now are grand romantic gestures. Okay, I'm just not, I'm not a big grand romantic gesture kinda guy. Guess that sucks for me. Oh. Uh, morning. - Morning. - I made you coffee already. - Thank you. - (chuckles) How are you? Fine. How are you? - Good. Um... - Hey, Elle. Hi, Sean. Hey. So I understand that I have you to thank for swiping right on me for Oscar. I did it so I wouldn't swipe right on you myself. (laughing) But seriously, I think you guys are so cute together. I love it. I totally ship this. Yay! - Sean: Oh. Guys? Hello? - (mouthing) Are we okay? - Sean: Oscar, I think the... - (mouthing) Yeah. - Sean: Hello? - (mouthing) You're acting wei. Sean: Um... Oscar, hello. - I think it... - Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. My computer just fell right over. Um, you, you were just saying how amazing you think I am. (straining, grunting) Hold on now, Mama, let me do that. You're too old to be wrestling with big old pots and stuff. You did not just call me "old." And I thought you'd never ask. Whoo! Whew. We have got a lot of work to do in this yard to get it ready for the anniversary party. You're coming, aren't you? I'm sure Dad wouldn't want me there. That's not true. You just both said some things that you didn't mean. He was always harder on me than James. Well, he wanted you to succeed in life. Yeah, but he never believed in me. We were both artists, you know. If anybody should have understood me wanting to be a musician, it should have been him. Nanda: He did. That's why he wanted you to have some kind of contingency so that you would be able to pay the bills. I could have paid the bills if he had loaned me the money to get the space for a recording studio. But no. Instead you guys used your money to help James get his house. Because the golden boy can do no wrong. Well, James had a good job and a house is a good investment. And we didn't feel comfortable doing a loan for a recording studio. You mean Dad didn't feel comfortable. It's not like you ever took up for me. (melancholy music playing) ♪ (cell phone ringing) (chuckles) Carl, I was just gonna call you. I think we should ask for wine allowance. Carl (on phone): Hey, Sarah. Uh, unfortunately I just got word... Did they say "postponed" or "canceled"? Carl: No one rally expected this thing to last so long... No, there is absolutely no way to predict how long this thing's gonna go on. I understand. Carl: So, they're just pulling it. I'm sorry... No. Thank you for calling. Okay. Goodbye. Charli only likes the way Mommy makes her sandwiches. Don't waste it. - Are you gonna eat it? - Maybe. Okay. Well, you know where it is if you get hungry later. How many ways are there to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Ways without a crust. - Since when? - A while. Okay, so cut the crust off. She also likes it cut in triangles, so that's another thing. Does she still like milk? She won't drink it without ice. Where'd she get that from? Me. Since when? I have always put ice in my milk. Oh, and I'd know that if I spent more time at home, right? - I didn't say anything. - You were thinking it. I was thinking that you're gone a lot. And you miss things. I don't wanna miss things, Sade, but I have to work. I produce movies. Movies are shot on location. I know, James, and I am so happy for you but you cannot run away from us and then expect us to be standing in the exact same place when you get back. You cannot have it both ways. Believe me, I understand that more than anyone. You make the sandwich. Cut it in triangles. No crust. I'm gonna go to the garage. I gotta work. (door opens, closes) (beeping) (upbeat music playing) ♪ - Hey. - Hey. - Did you finish the book? - I did. - What did you think? - I loved it. It's so frustrating though that Marianne and Connell can't just communicate. Adam: Oh, I get him though. He feels so much, but at the same time he has no idea how to express those feelings, except for on paper. Marianne doesn't make it easy for him, though. She's so distrusting of men. Which I can relate to. - Why? - Uh, because most men suck. Especially good-looking ones who can have any girl they want. Like my dad. He, he used to cheat on my mom all the time, and eventually he left her for another woman. And now he has an entirely different family. I'm sorry. Uh, I hope you don't think that I'm good-looking. (chuckles) You are. You probably have a girlfriend or a boyfriend because I am only attracted to unavailable men. Oh. So you're attracted to me? Oh. Sorry. You kinda walked into that one. Yeah, I really did. (both laugh) Adam: Uh, for what it's worth, I have neither a girlfriend nor a boyfriend. And I'm not a cheater. Said every cheater ever. Well... maybe you'll let me prove to you that there are good guys in the world. (chuckles) So tell me about your deep, dark secrets. - Hmm? - You got bodies buried somewhere? So many bodies. I grew up the queerest of five boys. - Five boys? - Mm-hmm. That's so many smelly shoes. Oscar: (snickers) Tell me about it. And they're all straight and into sports and could not wrap their heads around why I wanted to try on our mother's clothing all the time. Like, they violently objected to it. I'm really sorry. Where were your mom and dad at? My mom tried. But she was outnumbered, and my dad worked a lot. Drank a lot. Basically your typical American family. So, then how did they take it when you came out? Obviously they know I'm queer. I just, um... I haven't told them I'm non-binary. I just don't really wanna watch their heads explode. Also, it sucks coming out twice. I think it's really brave of you to change your pronouns. Most guys kind of... find that to be a turn-off. Well, I'm not most guys. Ha! - Your turn. - For what? Tell me about your family. They're actually pretty great. Do you have any baby pictures? - Do you wanna see them? - Yeah. I need to know what my future babies are going to look like. (laughing) Okay. Oscar: Oh my God, you were so cute! What do you mean were? I mean, you were cute, and you are now... (sighs) ...super-cute. Oh my God, I really want to kiss you. Yes, but phone sex is really weird. Doesn't have to be phone sex. Maybe we could... meet up? Is that weird? We've both been quarantined for weeks. How do I know you haven't been seeing all those guys you talk about? I told you that I don't do that anymore. Especially not when there's a contagious, fatal virus running amok. I am just saying old habits are hard to break. Mm-hmm. Like picking a fight to sabotage a relationship right before things get serious? Oh, is this... Oh my God, is this the time that you bail? I don't wanna bail. But I would like to be close to you. Did you just roll your eyes? No, I literal... I... I took first year psych. That's called a Freudian slip, but it was physicalized. What can I say, I'm... extremely physical. Well, now I really want to see you. (groans) What are you guys doing? Trying to make Jordan jealous by going on a dating app. But I'm not sure which one. You should try "Pairallell." Sophie: What do you know about dating apps? Nothing. I just read about it, you know. - An article in a magazine. - Sophie: Hmm. (phone ringing) Hey! Have you heard of that dating app "Pairallell"? - You on the dating apps? - (door closes) Yeah. I've dabbled. Any successful dabbling? Actually... I met someone. (chuckles) Explains all the phone calls outside. I wondered when selling life insurance had suddenly become so funny. Does this "someone" have a name? Gigi. What does Gigi do? She's a Pilates instructor. Oh my God. Well, that explains your sudden interest in your core. Wow! You wasted no time. I'm not the one who wanted the separation. Yeah, I just didn't realize that you would... leave and suddenly come alive. Hey. I've always been alive. You were just too busy doing your own thing to notice. I was busy doing my own thing because you were working all the time! Maybe if I had been a Pilates instructor, you would have been more interested in having fun. Having sex. I wasn't having fun or sex because I was busting my ass trying to support our family! I would have loved to have it the other way around, where I taught art and you worked a thankless, grueling job. I taught art part-time to five-year-olds! And the only reason I did that was so I could be close to Sophie! Everything I did was for Sophie and for you. I put my career on hold. And finally, I'm finally doing something for myself, and bam! A pandemic hits. Well, what about the Venice trip? - It was canceled. - Oh. And the article. My editor just called. I'm so sorry. Yeah, me too. I've got a headache. I'm gonna lie down. Hey, so are you pregnant yet? I... (sighs heavily) I don't know. I kinda hope not. What do you mean you hope not? I thought this was the babymoon period? Yeah, so did I. But all of a sudden, James is feeling unsure about a baby, and there's all this tension now. Out of nowhere. As if that's what this time needs right now. More tension. Girl. It's out there everywhere. Have you seen the video? Mmm. Yeah. The man was out for a jog. I know. Girl, I feel you on James. Me and Niles' honeymoon period cannot be more over. That man has so many annoying habits. What, like that whistling through his nose thing? God no! It's hella irritating. I'm like, maybe if you would just breathe in between shoving food in your mouth, you could eat without wheezing! But you and James, y'all have a strong foundation. You're gonna be all right. It's just... all this time we've been dreaming of "when things slow down." "When things slow down," that's all we've been saying. And now... here we are, this is it. This is the slowdown and... if we fight when he's gone and we fight when he's here, what have we been dreaming about? You just gotta breathe, baby. Don't stress yourself out. - (knocking on door) - Niles: Are you in there? One minute! I'm pooping! (bright music playing) ♪ Charles (on computer): I sure do miss you. I miss you too. Charles, do you think we were too hard on Dedrick? He's over there putting you on a guilt trip. No. But I was just thinking maybe we should have helped him with his business. Maybe if we'd had more faith in him, he'd have more faith in himself. Look, I, I don't wanna be blamed for Dedrick's problems. I'm not blaming you. I'm just thinking maybe it's time to put this family back together. It's hard enough to be in this imposed isolation. We shouldn't choose to be isolated from people we love. (strumming) We're having dinner. Me, you, and your dad. - I... I don't want... - And you don't have a say. And neither does your father. You say I didn't take up for you. Well, I'm taking up for you now. He loves you and you love him. Enough is enough. We eat at 5:00 sharp. And change your shirt. Nothing black, I'd like to see you in something a little more cheerful. Okay. (scoffs) "Gigi. Pie, lattes, Pilates." Seriously, Paul? (cell phone beeps) Sophie! - What? - You were out partying? Where did you get that? I, I blocked you guys on Instagram. Uh... one of my friends follows you. And that's not the point! We're in the middle of a pandemic and you're out partying! What if you got sick? What if you got us sick? I'm sorry, okay! I wasn't thinking. I was trying to make Jordan jealous. You were thinking. About yourself. Like you always do. I'm sorry, Dad. - Are you gonna tell Mom? - Of course I'm gonna tell your mother. Just not right now. She's in bed. She's not feeling well. She doesn't feel well? Shit! You're sick? Do you have a fever or chills? - No. - Cough, shortness of breath? No. - Can you smell this? - Yes. You guys, what's going on? Sophie went to a party. - You did what? - I'm sorry. Are you gonna be okay? - Do we need to wear masks? - Yes. No... Sarah: I don't have COVID. I don't have COVID. At least I don't think I do. - Hi. - Hey. You look nice. (chuckling) And we can sit six feet apart. (sighs) Mmm. Hi. Nurse Maggie, It's Nanda. Is Charles ready for dinner? Maggie: Hey, Nanda. Charles is asleep already. Asleep? No, he was expecting us to call for dinner. Maggie: I tried to get him up, but he says he's too tired for dinner tonight. Is he okay? Maggie: Oh yes, he had a good day. Maybe he just overdid it. Uh, okay. Thank you. This isn't because of you. Uh, well, if we're not having dinner with Dad, I don't want to risk getting too close. ♪ I don't know. I mean, things have just been, like, really weird with Elle. Okay. Weird, how? (Elle laughing) (Adam talking indistinctly) We're used to spending all this time together, right? But now, now it's just like we're... roommates. Well, you guys are roommates. Right. I mean... Oh, and yes of course, I forgot "soulmates." - What's that, what's that tone in your voice? - I didn't have a tone. I didn't. I didn't have a tone. It... There was no tone. I, I've been thinking... No, I did think that, well, you know, maybe there's a little bit of co-dependence there. That maybe that's, that's part of, of why you're both single. And maybe why you've had a little bit of trouble creating some space in your life for another person. You sound like my therapist. Is that a good thing? No. I hate my therapist. Because she tells you the truth? Well, uh... Actually, I, I gotta go. Oh, come on, Oscar, don't get mad. - I'm not mad. - Sean: Don't do that. I'm, I'm not mad. Okay. I just, I... I don't think you really know me that well, and now you're telling me what my problems are. We've been talking for weeks largely about that. You don't think that I know you even a little bit? I just... I think the only person who knows me well enough to do that is Elle. Okay, great. Well, then it sounds like maybe you found the relationship that you were already looking for and I've been wasting my time. If that's how you actually feel, then you're probably right. Sean: Okay, bye. I forgot to hang up.

Hmm. So... I was going through old boxes of pictures in my office, and I found a bunch of you when you were pregnant. Bunch of you and Charli. They all had one thing in common. I'm not in most of them. Must have been hard for you holding it down all by yourself with a baby. Tell ya, this quarantine has made me realize, like, I gotta be around more. I can be of service to my family and learn how to make peanut butter and jelly that our child will eat. - (chuckles) - Triangles. No crust. Yeah. When things get back up and running... (clears throat) ...I'll make some real changes and be home more. If it's gonna take me away from this, it has to be extraordinary. Because you're extraordinary. And Charli's extraordinary. Yeah. Thank you. No, really, I appreciate that. It's... really all I've ever wanted. Just us, under one roof. All right, I'll leave you to it. You sound beautiful. Oh, um, by the way, I, uh... I got my period. Oh. - So... - Okay. Well... Where does that leave us? I mean, are we still trying? Um... I don't think I want to have another baby. Ever?

We are in a book club. Aww. Is "Fifty Shades" on the reading list? That "book" is barely considered literature. I should know. I read it twice. (laughs) So are you, uh, are you into him? No. No. (clears throat) So what's up with you and Sean? I'm surprised you guys aren't co-sleeping with your laptops. Ha ha! I don't know. I think you're right. I don't really know him. I think I was just projecting all the things I wanted him to be. - Do you wanna get drunk? - Always. - Yes! - (laughs) I'll just get the wine. Don't... flip out. Ha ha! Too late. I'm sure your mom's gonna be okay. Don't worry. Thanks. I just... I don't what I'd do if I gave her the virus, you know. How did your dad find out we went to the party? One of his friends follows me on Instagram, I guess. Then you need to do a follower check and delete that problem stat. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. - Do we know a Gigi? - I don't think so. Some Gigi girl has been commenting on all my posts. Like, "Jordan doesn't deserve you, girl!" Is that your dad's friend? I don't think so. She's kind of young. And hot. - Oh my God! - Kaia: What? My dad's having an affair! We missed you earlier for dinner. Dinner? Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah, because of the rain? - What? - Well, we couldn't get to the restaurant because of the rain. That's right. Um... (clears throat) So I've been working on the menu for the anniversary party. You have any request? Whose anniversary is it? Ours. Are we married? Yes. We were married in Atlanta almost 50 years ago. May 10th, 1970. In my grandparents' backyard. It was supposed to rain that day. But God favored us and the sun came out. My sister Annabelle was my maid of honor. And your army buddy John was your best man. And you were wearing a tan linen suit that made me lose my breath. You were so fine. And that was the day we made our vow to love each other for ever. In sickness and in health. Remember? (light music playing) ♪ (Elle and Oscar giggling) (Oscar talking indistinctly) Okay. Alright, alright, my turn. Don't look. Don't look. - Okay, sorry. - Excuse me. (clears throat) "Missy Stevens' party was so crunk! "I still can't believe she invited me. "She has a life-size cut-out of Usher in her bedroom. Do you think she'd notice if it went missing?" Okay, so that's two. - Drink up! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Two? How? Mention of a celebrity crush, - one. - Okay. Use of an outdated phrase, two. Outdated phrase? I was very ahead of my time. "Crunk"? Unless you are Lil Jon, that is unacceptable. Whatever happened to him? He's just so "Lil." I can't believe we've never read our childhood diaries to each other. I know. (chuckles) - Well go. - Okay. Okay. "Dear Diary, I think I'm in love with Hunter." - Aww. - "He's the bomb-dot-com. "I want to tell him how I feel. "But he's also my best friend. "I don't want to ruin our friendship if he doesn't feel the same way about me." - Mm-hmm. - (chuckles) Does anybody see a pattern here? Mm-mm. Did you, um, did you ever tell him? No. I was much wiser in my young age. Hey. I'm really glad you told me, okay. You're really beautiful and I miss you. And we already love each other. And you're beautiful. You said that already. Yeah, but what if we are meant to be? ♪
