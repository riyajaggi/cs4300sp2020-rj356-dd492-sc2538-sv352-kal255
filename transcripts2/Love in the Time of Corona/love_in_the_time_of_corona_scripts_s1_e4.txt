 'cause things were suddenly awkward between us 'cause, 'cause they're not. They're not. For me at all. Are they for you? No. No. I don't think so. (chuckles) Cool. So, um, I will... I'm gonna come right back. Elle: Okay. (cell phone beeps) (sighs) (chuckles) "I promise to always be your travel buddy, "to appreciate everything you do, and...

 to never give up on us." (door opens) How could you cheat on Mom? - What? - I know about Gigi! Does Mom know? (sighs) Yes, Sophie. Your mother knows. Knows about what? You're up! Are you feeling okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm so sorry! - For what, sweetheart? - Dad's affair. I'm not having an affair. Oh, so now you're denying it? Sweetheart... baby, your Dad and I separated. He moved out after the holidays. What are you talking about? We were, uh, gonna tell you when you came back this summer. But with quarantine and Jordan breaking up with you, we thought it was too much for you to handle. Well, you're right! It is too much for me to handle! Are you joking? I mean, as if a pandemic wasn't bad enough, my boyfriend breaks up with me, and then I find out my parents are sus as hell! Thanks. Wow! Baking? Sade Aldicott, I have seen it all. The last time you were making something in an oven, you were in grad school. Well, luckily, the directions are on the box. I am strong. I am capable. I can make biscuits. So I'm guess things between you and James are still... Shitty. Yeah, he told me last night that he didn't want to have another baby. Ever. Oh wow. That's, that's a full 180. Yeah. He's just retreating, emotionally, and I don't know why. How are you? - Um, are you home? - (Adaeh coughing) Why are you coughing? Okay, now don't be worried, but... - I've got the 'Rona. - What? What? How do you know? I went to urgent care and got a test. What do, what do you need? What, what can we do? Nothing. (sniffles) They said I just gotta ride it out, - that I'll be fine - Sade: I'm so sorry. What are your symptoms? Fever, chills, headache, exhaustion. No trouble breathing yet, but they said it could take a turn for the worse in week two. Kinda like my relationship did in week four. - What happened? - Girl, me and Niles, we just kept arguing like we had been married for 20 years. I mean, like, who quarantines their delivery boxes. Who does that? I do. Yes, but I'm not sleeping with you. Damn. I really thought I knew him. After three virtual dates? Mm. Don't do that, okay. It's not about how long you've known someone, it's about the quality of the communication in the relationship. Once that breaks down, then you're toast. Sean: (on phone) Hey, Oscar, it's Sean. Listen, I'm really sorry I was a jerk. Elle's your best friend, and of course you miss her. I, I understand that. And as far as meeting up goes, I'll wait until you're ready. However long it takes, okay. Just please... please call me. (sighs) ♪ I cannot believe that you made all of this. I, uh, I wasn't sure how you liked your eggs, so I made them scrambled and fried. And then I was worried you might not even like eggs, so I made pancakes and toast. And blueberry muffins. This is amazing. Thank you. Oh, and one last thing. Because you won't let me listen to any of your music until I let you read something that I've written, I, uh, hid something under the placemat. ♪ "Love in the Time of Corona." Guess I finally found some inspiration. (chuckles) Uh... Let me guess. You're leaving to go quarantine with Gigi? No. I wanna stay here with you. I like being part of this family. - Is Mom okay with that? - She is. Are you? What happened to you guys? I don't know. I think maybe for me... I stopped appreciating your mother at some point. I'm sorry I went to the party. You were right. I was only thinking about myself. I guess I do that a lot. Hey. You're 19. It's part of the process. I think it would be nice if we did something for your mother. Make something special. Like a bundt cake? Or maybe something a little more significant. I have an idea, but I need your help. I'm in. As long as it requires zero effort. I'm kidding. I'm just fine. I'm just looking forward to your father coming home. James: Ma, you know, I called him yesterday... and I don't think he knew who I was. Of course he knew who you were. He just gets a little confused sometimes. But I think when we bring him home, around familiar surroundings, he's gonna get much better. Hey, Ma, can I ask you something? You can ask me anything, except how old I am. I know how old you are. Nanda: Yeah, well, I'm going to deny it, okay. Did you, did you see that, um, that video of the black man being shot and killed? Ahmaud Arbery? Yes. Yes, I did. Is it ever gonna stop? We just have to hope that God hears our prayers. When, Ma? It's been 400 years in this country. God can't see? He can't hear? Nanda: There has been progress. We may not be where we're supposed to be, we may not get what we deserve, -but it's sure as shit ain't what it was. -Hey! - Language, young lady. - (Nanda laughs) How were you and Daddy not angry all the time? Nanda: Who says we weren't? But we had to claim our joy, son. That was our protest. Okay. But you had two black sons. Weren't you scared? Nanda: I mean, it doesn't matter that we raised you right. It doesn't matter that you're good, capable men. Nanda: If you're stopped by the police, none of that matters. That is why I put all my faith in God. Yeah, well... I wish I had your faith. But I am afraid for Charli. I don't know, Mom, what I'm gonna do. You get on with it, son. That's what you do. And, uh, by the way, Dedrick is here. Nanda: He's been staying in the guest house. He's been very helpful, and I want you to reach out to him. Talk about angry. Nanda: He's not angry. He's lost. Nanda: You wanna do something? Be there for your own brother. ♪ ♪ They say you should smile more ♪ ♪ Darling, show your eyes more ♪ ♪ Aren't you satisfied? ♪ ♪ I'm tired of trying to please someone ♪ ♪ Who doesn't even ♪ ♪ Care what's on my mind ♪ Adam: (on phone) So what did you think? I think you are not gonna be flipping houses much longer. You're an amazing writer. Thanks. That, uh, means a lot coming from you. ♪ Don't wanna be young and sad ♪ ♪ Another day longer ♪ You okay? Adam, there's something I need to tell you. I... have sort of been in love with my best friend, Oscar, for a long time. But I didn't think that we would ever be together uh, but then... last night... well... we, um... We're sort of together now. Adam: Oh. Uh... I don't know what to say. I didn't really see that coming. Yeah. Me neither. It sort of happened out of nowhere. Although we're so close already and we live together, it's kind of like we're already married. Um, I think being in a quarantine just kinda made it clear, you know. I'm sorry. No. Don't... Don't be sorry. Um... I'm happy for you. I am. Love is hard to come by. Especially right now. You're lucky you found each other. Or, didn't find, but got clear. Elle: Yeah. Adam: Well, take care. Bye. ♪ Don't wanna feel numb ♪ ♪ Or mad ♪ (door closes) ♪ Until I go under ♪ - (sniffles) - Babe, what's wrong? I... I ruined everything by telling my friends that we were trying to have a baby, and I ruined how good it was between us, and I ruined the biscuits! Well, I, I love burned biscuit. Barbecue! I'm serious! What if we're toast? Did you burn that too? I don't know. Did I? I just... I don't understand how you just changed your mind and we didn't even get to have a conversation. I still want to have another baby with you. And I wish that I hadn't told other people that we were trying. I wish that I had kept it just between us. But really, I don't... You just changed your mind because of that? Oh, baby, that's... that's not why I changed my mind. I'm, I'm sorry. I... Then what? Do you remember when I asked you to marry me? Your family was giving me the side eye because we'd been together for five years, but I was waiting. I wanted to know that I could be an equal contributor in this relationship. I'm not ev... I'm not even talking about providing, okay. I'm just talking about I wanted to know I was gonna be able to cover my half of the rent. I needed a, I needed a peace to fall on me about it. And then I got that great job with Spike. Right? And I had health insurance, and I had a paycheck coming in. And I bought your ring the very next week. And when we had... our beautiful daughter, things were so good between us. And we gave her my grandmother's name so that she would know she was loved. And it breaks my heart that every year, she gets older, she has to shed a layer of her innocence and take up a layer of armor just so she can survive out there. As her parents, we have to thread that needle between building up her self-esteem and protecting herself in a world that's not gonna always respect her precious little life. Her precious black life. Having kids means you gotta make peace with the world as it is. You gotta make peace, and I, I... I can't make peace right now. I can't. (sniffles) I can't do it. Okay. Okay. "At the very least, cloth face coverings will get you in the habit of not touching your face." I'm literally touching my face right now. I mean, I can't even talk about not touching my face without touching my face! (sighs) You never really read books, do you? No. No, but I read a lot online. But you don't read books online. No. Is that... Is that a judgment? No, it's just... - an observation. - Hmm. Well, you don't really keep up with the news. Is that a judgment? No. No. No. Just a... (chuckles) Just an observation. (sighs) So, should we talk about... what this is? Like... are we in a relationship now? (both chuckle) Yeah, I mean, I... guess so. So, now we are living together and in a relationship. Well, that, that was fast, huh? What are we, lesbians? (awkward laughter) (clears throat) We probably should still... have our own bedrooms, though. Oh. Totally. Totally. And we shouldn't feel like we have to spend every night together. - Exactly. - Like, maybe tonight we... - We can sleep in our own beds. - Yeah. I just don't want us to feel overwhelmed by all of this. Me neither. So, what did you tell Sean? Um... Yeah, I mean, I kinda... I just told him the truth, you know. We were... we were basically over anyway. Mm-hmm. (cell phone ringing) Hello. Hey, man. It's James. How you doin'? Dedrick: I'm all right. Just helping Mom out. ♪ Pretending not to be afraid ♪ ♪ Man: (on television) A few more announcements as well and then we'll get to questions. Together with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, you probably heard the news today, and this is big news, that we are extending the Safer at Home order until May 15th. This was based on the advice of Dr. Ferrer. I wanna thank her... ♪ It's shaping up out here, huh? Yeah. But no need to hurry. (sighs heavily) What's wrong? They have extended the Shelter-at-Home order until May 15th at least. There's not gonna be an anniversary party. Dedrick: I'm sorry, Mama. (sighs) You know, the truth is... even before the pneumonia, I was having a hard time taking care of your father. He would fall, and I couldn't get him up and... He would be cooking and leave a pot on the stove until it burned. And I'm thinking to myself, what if he gets confused and wanders off, like people with dementia do? I've just been kidding myself. I may not be able to bring your father home. (sighs) I tell you what... I'll take you to the nursing home on your anniversary. So you can see him, at least through the glass. You know, James called me. - Oh, he did? - (both laugh) Now, don't act all surprised. He told me you told him to do it. I didn't know he would actually do it. Well, he is the stubborn one. If you ask me, all the men in this family are stubborn. (both laugh) (laptop beeps) Hey. Hi. Look who it is. I thought you were ghosting me. Hi! Aww, you, you look so cute. Thank you. Um, what's going on? Where have you been? (sighs) I'm sorry. I got scared and when I get scared, I push people away. Okay. So I didn't blow it? No. No, I... I blew it. Um... I... I had sex with Elle. Okay. Oscar: She told me that she'd been in love with me for a long time, and... I don't know, it just, it just kind of happened. Okay. Um... It's just weird because you just... Because you accused me of, of hooking up with other people. Well, Elle... Okay, Elle is not "other people." She... She's Elle. Right. Are you in love with her? ♪ No. No! God, no. No. No, okay. I... (sighs) I think I might be falling in love with you. You were right. I mean, this scares the hell out of me. I just don't know what to tell her. The idea of, of hurting her or of losing her. So... I'm sorry. I just... I don't, I don't see how this is gonna work. Sean: Yeah. Okay. Even though I'm falling in... It's okay. Sorry, I, um... I thought that I... I heard something when I was... I was, I was listening at the door, but... - I'm sorry. I, I didn't... - Elle: No. No. But really, it's, it's okay. It's not right between us. And it has nothing to do with that we had sex or anything... Oh my God, does he know that we had sex? - Sean: Yeah, I, I... - Yeah, he does. Okay. The sex was nice. And... (sighs) I just think that we're better off as friends. Oh my God, I, I do too. I do too. - I do too. - Yeah. I also think you're better off as friends. - Okay, go. - I... Okay, I will... I'm gonna leave you two alone completely. - You can have privacy... - Goodbye. - Okay. Sorry. Okay. - Oscar: Thank you so much. - Thank you. - (whispers): Sorry. Whoo! Well, that was like... That was like a roller-coaster. - Wow. - Oscar: Um, what were we talking about? Oh my God, I said a thing. You were gonna say a thing. No, I don't think so. Sure about that? Yeah. Yeah. No, I, I wasn't... I wasn't gonna say anything. Hmm. Okay. Sarah: Okay, if you're ready, here I come! Ciao, bella! Oh! Buona sera! Benvenuti a Venezia. What did you guys do? (in Italian accent): Since you cannot go to Venice, we brought-a Venice to you. And you cooked dinner? I made-a the pasta. And I made the meatballs, with a lot of help from a TikTok. Video. - (laughing) Thank you. - Paul: Beautiful lady, it's customary to have the gondola ride - pre-dinner, huh? - (Sarah gasps) Come. Come. Yes, please. (laughing) - I don't know if this is a good idea. - Come on, lovely lady. Come on, lovely lady. - (Sarah screams) - Paul: Come on. (laughing) You can sit over there. Go on. I think somebody is coming for us. - Sarah: Yes. - We make an escape, huh? - (humming) - Sarah: Oh, be careful. You two, this is incredible. (Paul continues humming) Something good in Italian! Do you think all the gondoliers sing? Paul: Yes, they do. (Sarah laughing) Most kids had a stuffed animal or a blanket. You... had a soup ladle. (all laugh) You took it everywhere with you. - You even slept with it. - Oh. God, I was such a weird kid. No, you were adorable. Still are. You know, I, I'm kind of glad that Jordan broke up with me. 'Cause if he had quarantined with us, we wouldn't have this time together, you know? I know that you guys aren't together anymore, but can we still spend time like this? - Like a, like a family? - Paul: Hey, we'll always be a family. That will never change. I love you. I'm going to crash. I love you too, baby. Thank you, sweetheart. - I love you. - I love you. (light music playing) ♪ Thank you for everything tonight. - My pleasure. - It was so lovely. You know, I think, uh... it's a shame that this quarantine didn't happen a little earlier. Before we separated. I'm sorry that I was so busy trying to be Super Mom. I wish I had spent more time focused on us. I'm sorry I was being such a pain in the ass. You think that we could... try? (sighs) Yeah. I mean, I would love that. What about Gigi? Honestly... I hate Pilates. (laughing) ♪ I really do hate Pilates. (both laugh) Oh... You know how beautiful you are? Stop. How do you feel? (sighs) I'm fine. (sighs) Your parents, my parents, our grandparents... none of them had it easy. And we're still here. They still had us. They believed in us, James. And I do too. Yeah, the world is scary and... hard, but that's not a reason to stop. Let's finish what we started. Let's finish what they started. You know, and Charli, she would be such a good big sister. I'll give it some more thought. That's all I ask. These biscuits ain't half bad when you scrape the burnt parts off. - Yeah? - It's true. Scrape it off and... I... Stop... So tasty.

Yeah! That was amazing! Thank you. (laughs) It looks like you inspired me too. And, uh... Oscar and I decided that we're better off as friends. I'm sorry to hear that. (door opens, closes) - Okay, I, I'm outside. - Sean: Okay. Um... look up. Sean: Look up. (airplane droning) I'm in love with you, too! Oh my God. You made a grand romantic gesture! Sean: I really did. ♪ I remember when you used to say ♪ ♪ I didn't have time for you ♪ ♪ My baby ♪ ♪ I'm doing nothing ♪ ♪ I'm doing nothing ♪ ♪ Nothing at all ♪ ♪ Nothing at all ♪ ♪ So, baby, please, please, please, baby ♪ - Oh! - Nanda: Here I come. - Ha ha! - Charles: Oh!

(horns honking) Oh my God, this is wonderful. - Just... just wonderful. - Well, Mom, I've been thinking, if I stay living in the guest house, when this is over, we can bring Dad home. I can help take care of him. - You would do that? - Of course I will. (airplane droning) - Ah! - Mom, look. "You can't quarantine love." "You can't quarantine love." - Ain't that the truth. - Charles: Look at that! Oh, that's so wonderful.
