 Entourage (2004–2011): Season 1, Episode 4 - Date Night - full transcript 
 Ari wakes Eric with a phone call to remind him that tonight is the all-important opening night for Vince's movie. Immediately after Eric hangs up, Emily unexpectedly drops off fan mail, but with ulterior motives. Drama introduces the guys to his latest lady friend back at the house and then they discuss their plans for the evening over breakfast at a diner. Vince's major work for the day is a stop at Big Boy's Neighborhood, a local radio show. As a result of the appearance, Vince secures a date for himself with Justine Chapin. While everybody gets ready for the night's activities, Ari video conferences with Eric to tell him that matinée numbers for Vince's movie have been "less than stellar" because it is in direct competition with the latest Pixar feature. Kristen also calls to confess to Eric that she might still harbor feelings for him. Turtle resorts to desperate measures to get a date for their night of bowling, and it does not go unspoiled. After bowling, the large group makes a stop at a night club where, one by one, the boys find themselves alone. The night does not end on a bad note, however, and Ari arrives with some good news.

 ♪ Yeah, oh yeah ♪ ♪ Oh yeah. ♪ Drama, will you relax? Baby bro didn't come home last night, and he's not answering his phone. Don't tell me to relax. He probably stayed at Sasha's. No, more likely he went on a bender and he's facedown in a gutter somewhere, wondering why his friends and family aren't searching for him right now. - Let's not be overly dramatic. - Overly dramatic? Unless he's distributing, this is a large quantity of cocaine he's holding. That is kind of Tony Montana-style. Carlos, what I'm saying is I think Mark Cuban is reasonable

 so I think you need to apologize for how you spoke to him. Hello? He hung up on me. - Who cares?! - What's he saying? He's saying he's gonna raise the money to buy out his brother himself. - Then raise it! - How much does he need? - $20 million. - You can start by selling this. Can we please focus on my missing brother right now? - You still haven't reached him? - Nope. Well, what are we gonna do? Here you go, bend your knees. Your movie star isn't showing, is he? Take it easy. It's 10:30 and he was supposed to be here at 10:00. Something must have happened. He's usually very responsible. - Did you remind him? - Yes I did. You were there, honey, last night sitting next to me. Right! I forgot after all that happened. - Can we move past that? - No! Because everyone is looking at me! - I don't even want to be here. - You're here because of your son. And no one is looking at you... except for that Siegel kid's dad who always looks at you because he wants to bang you. - I am not comfortable, Ari. - Neither am I. Some of these people saw you let me walk out of that place alone. You think I was wrong to? You're supposed to support your husband no matter what. Even if you're making a complete jackass out of yourself? - Especially then! - I am very upset, Ari. - As am I. - Do not push me! Ari, is this movie star of yours going to show up or what? - 'Cause we need to get started. - Yeah, John, he's... - How are you, darling? - I've been better, thank you, John. - Daddy, is Vince coming? - We're working on that, buddy. Because Parker Siegel doesn't believe I really know him. Parker, he knows him, believe me, okay? Tell your dad to stop looking at my wife. - Yeah, Parker! - Seriously, Dad, my friends are gonna be really pissed too. Okay, you've now officially humiliated the entire family. - John, so nice to see you. - So nice to see you, darling. You're looking great. Really. She hates your guts. Uh-huh. I say we call every hospital in a 30-mile radius; maybe the police department, file a missing person's report. He hasn't even been missing 24 hours. That's what they said about the Lindbergh baby! You gotta jump on a missing person early or poof! You lose them forever. - Morning, Jennie. - Morning, E. - Oh hey, Jennie. - Hey, Johnny. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. What are you doing here? Um, I work here. - Yeah. - Drama! You can't bang my assistant. Why, you don't think I could get her? E, I know we hate each other, but this is about Vince. - What about him? - I was gonna call you this morning. - Speak, Scott! - Okay. - I think that Vince has a real problem. - Why? Because he showed up at my house at 4:00 in the morning, wanting me to hang out, looking for cocaine. - Oh God. - And when I said no, he went fucking crazy. Jennie, you gotta find Sasha Grey's number - and get her on the phone now. - I'm on it. It's gonna be okay. I'll call you as soon as I hear something. And please call me if you do. Okay. Bye. - That was Vince's mom. - She hasn't heard from him? Nope. She's freaking out. So is my dad. I just got off with him. - What's he freaking out about? - He spoke to Carlos. - What'd he say? - He was crying. - Carlos was? - Yeah. Avión's been Carlos's whole life, Turtle. It will kill him if he loses it. - I know. - So do something. Alex, I'm calling everybody I know who has money. I know. That might be Vince. Hello? - Man: Yeah, who's this? - Who's this? You called me. This is Ryan Howard. I was calling you back. Oh hey, Ryan, it's Turtle! I met you with Vinnie Chase at the World Series last year. Oh yeah, I remember you. You're the dude that was screaming out and calling me a pussy. Aw, don't take that personally, Ryan. You were playing the Yanks. When you were beating the Dodgers in the NLCS was there anyone screaming louder for you than me? Yeah yeah, whatever, man. What's up? What's up is you just signed a $125-million contract and I'm sure you're looking for ways to safely invest your money. - And you've got a way? - Yeah... tequila. No, man, I don't... I don't think so. - Don't you want to hear more about it? - No, not really. But, hey, tell Vinnie I said what's up and to give me a call later. I gotta go to work. Okay, I'll keep trying. - And call me if you find Vince. - I will. Man: Nice nice, beautiful. Wiggle it a little for me, okay? Okay okay. Okay, now make it pop for me, right down the aisle, right down that middle lane. That's right, hot! Okay, now turn to the left a little bit... yeah yeah. Oh, the other left. Right, nice. Okay, good. Good. - Can we break for a minute? - Yeah, just a minute. Look at you... hot stuff. What happened to you last night? C'mere, give me a kiss. - I woke up and you were gone. - I had to go home. In the middle of the night? I was worried. I couldn't sleep, I didn't want to wake you. You had a big day today. - Why are you wearing the same clothes? - I don't know, I'm lazy. - And freaking out. - No. Why would I be? - This is just the box cover. - I know, I'm here to be supportive. Which one is he? The douchebag on the left? - Stop. - No, really. I'm curious. Which one do you think? I have no idea. Why don't you just tell me? - Better yet, introduce me. - No. Come on, Sash, I'll be nice. Fine. Vince! - His name is Vince? - Weird, I know. - Vince, this is Vince. - What up? - Vince, big fan. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Too bad I can't say the same. - I haven't seen your work. - That's too bad. Well, I've seen all of yours. Even "Medellin. " What, are you being a fucking asshole? Okay. Huh? What? John, I planned this party for six months. I'm not canceling. I'm only suggesting you postpone for a couple of weeks. Do you really want to put your relationship on display when it's in this very fragile state? It's not in a fragile state. We had a fight, that's it. - Any word from Vince? - No, not yet. - Jesus. - Hello, John. Barbara. I assume you saw "Perez Hilton" this morning. Your scene in Wolfgang's got you a very nice headline. You read "Perez Hilton"? My girlfriend's 23, I have to stay relevant. Barbara: The article also said that while you were screaming like a raving lunatic at Amanda, Vince and Sasha were in the bathroom... - fucking. - What? This guy'll make anything up. I met my girlfriend in that bathroom. - Now look, Ari... - No. John, I am not gonna cancel the party. - End of story. - Maybe I'm not coming. - Why not? - The tension between you two is palpable. I mean it was very very uncomfortable at the baseball field. - For who?! - For whom? - Oh Jesus, come on. - For everyone, all right? And... I'm at a crossroads with my lady. - What crossroads? - Well, she wants to get married. John, you've been down that road three times already. Yeah, but she wants a kid while I'm still young. - You're nuts. - Look, the point is we do not need any tension around us, okay? There will be no tension. - I think you ought to go home. - Go home why? Look, you do not want your wife walking into a surprise party with all your best friends when the only thought she has in her head is about killing you! Go home. Go on. Yo, Drew, it's Turtle. I met you at the Super Bowl with Vincent Chase. Oh hey, Turtle. What's up, man? How's Vince doing? - Uh, he's doing. - So what's going on? How would you like to invest in a tequila company? Uh, I wouldn't. Even if I told you Mark Cuban wants to put 20 mill in real bad? Really? Now would I own it at the same price as him? No, see, what I want to do is raise the money myself and then kick Cuban out of this thing. - Turtle. - Yeah? You were the guy at the game with the hat on backwards, right? Yeah, probably. Hey, man, phone's breaking up. I can't hear you. I hear you just fine. Hey, man, yeah, I'll hit you back. Sorry. Drew! Hello? - The guy's a dick. - You're the one being a dick. - Really? - Look, he's just jealous. Oh, he's jealous? And tell me, what does he have to be jealous of? He's the one fucking my girlfriend. He's working and a movie star showed up? He's nervous. Oh, now he's nervous. So which one is it... - is he nervous or jealous? - It's both. He knows I don't care about him when we're fucking - but I do care about you. - Bullshit. 'Cause if you cared about me, you wouldn't do this movie. - Vince, we've been over this. - Let's go over it again! You do this movie, we're done. Fuck you. Are you fucking serious? I told you don't fucking tell me what to do! Like I'm crazy for trying to tell you not to do this? You knew what I did when I met you. - Well, it's making me sick. - Guys like you that go and fuck all sorts of girls just for the fun of it usually make me sick too. But I made an exception. I guess I fucked up. Go home, Vince. If I leave now, I'm not coming back. Goodbye then. Sasha, calm down, tell me what happened. He's such a fucking asshole. I'm in the middle of work and he shows up and acts like a fucking amateur. - I'll talk to him. - Don't bother, I'm done. - Do you know where he is? - No clue. He probably ran home like he did last night. He didn't go home last night. He went out looking for drugs. - How bad is he, Sasha? - Worse than I thought, I guess. I'm sorry. Call me and let me know he's okay. Okay. Drama! - Will you stop talking to her? - We weren't talking. - We were looking at "Perez. " - What's it say? Nothing good. We need to talk to him. - I think he's heading back to the house. - Good, let's go. - Hey, Scott! - What are you calling him for? - We need to call everyone. - What's up? - Come with us to Vince's. - For what? We're gonna have an intervention. You promised me you would get her to the party. I know I did, Ari. I feel so bad. I just can't deal with all the lying, given what's happening. Nothing is happening! Don't believe everything that you read. Ari, my husband is coming out of rehab next week. I have enough of my own drama. I can't take on yours. How am I supposed to get her out of the house? I don't know. I'm sorry, I just can't get involved. - Marlo! - Tell her I say happy birthday! Fuck fuck...! Hello? Hello. Baby, what's wrong? What's wrong? She married a scumbag, that's what's wrong. Marci, what are you doing here? I flew in to comfort my ailing sister. - She's not ailing. - Yes I am, Ari. - I'm ailing badly! - About what specifically right now? About the fact that she married a scumbag! Marci, I'm having a conversation with my wife. I'm sorry. Why are you at home? Because I want to spend the day with you. She is not interested. Could you just shut the fuck up and let... Do not speak to my sister like that! Okay, I don't want to speak to her at all. I want to speak to you. So speak. I'm sorry about last night. It'll never happen again. - Oh my God, bullshit! - Listen, I swear to God, Marci, - I will take a fucking frying pan... - And call her a whore? You're gonna bully some more women? - I'm going upstairs. - Baby... - Go, just go. - Hold on. Fuck you. Ken, please, can you just come over here and hear me out - one last time? - Turtle, the deal's done. We're gonna make Carlos a rich man whether he likes it or not. How many yachts can you waterski behind? Are you quoting "Wall Street"? Ken: Greed is good, baby! Mark, please, I can't come chasing after you. - There's something going on with Vince. - Is Vince okay? Hopefully he will be. I can't talk about it over the phone. Okay, we'll come by. Can't wait to hear what you have to say, Turtle. Thank you. Neither can I. There's no stress about eating with your father. I don't know what you're making such a big deal about. He is. It's not me. - How? - He doesn't want me there. - What? Why? - I don't know. He's being weird. My guess is he's gonna grill you about your plans for the bachelor party. Look, I'm not scared of your father. He and I get along great. We'll meet after for a drink. Uh, maybe you should have a drink before too. - Maybe. - Good luck with Vince. Thanks. Meeting up with Terrence for dinner. - Fun. - I heard he was as big a slacker as our boss when he was still in the business. I don't want to hear about it, Scott. - You don't want to hear what? - Anything about Murray from you. I need you here for Vince and if that's not why you're here, then I'll call you a cab. I think you think you're tougher than you actually are. I'm tougher than both you guys, so knock it off. We're here for Vince. Let's do this. - Yo, Vince! - Vince, you home? - He's not here. - Great. Now what do we want to do? We wait. E, you want to call Ari again? - Yeah, I'll call him. - You found him? - Yeah, we think he's heading home. - Thank God. - We need you here now. - That cannot happen. Ari, we think Vince has a drug problem. And if you're not here in a half an hour, I promise you you're never gonna see him again. Marci, I am so sorry that I yelled at you. Pfft. How about her? Have I ever asked anything of you? I have a favor to ask you now, please. - Uh... no. - Listen, I need you to get her out of the house and keep her out until 7:30. Why, do you have hookers coming over or something? Not everyone is like your ex-husband. Oh yeah, that's right. Because you just call women whores, you don't actually fuck them. Look, I have an incredible surprise party planned for her 40th tonight, okay? I got the caterers coming over here in less than an hour and I got Christina Aguilera singing her favorite song here. - Really? - Yeah. That's weird, because I'm just here by chance - and I didn't get a fucking invite! - Shh! I'm sorry, but we didn't think that you would come. You thought I would miss a chance to just watch you throw money at another problem? Look, I do what I do and I'm pretty good at it. And I'd spend every last dime that I have to show her how much I care about her. She wants a husband. She doesn't want a fucking party. - It's a grand gesture. - You're an asshole. You have been struggling ever since the divorce, right? Three kids and no help. Yes yes, you would think that since their father fucked the music teacher I could at least get free piano lessons. - Okay, I will clear your debts. - What? You get her out of the house and bring her back, I will clear your debts. I'll keep your kids in that private school you love... even the not-so-quick one who had to repeat the third grade. - Why? - Because I love my wife. And because this night is important to me and because your kids are important to her. None of you watch "Intervention" on A&E;? - All: No. - Phenomenal. What we need to do is we need to sit Vince down and tell him how his behavior has affected us. - How it's affected us? - Yeah. Turtle, you go first. You say, "Vince, your behavior has affected me negatively in the following ways... " Go ahead. Come on. Well, I didn't sleep last night, but that was because you wouldn't let me. - Are you kidding me? - Honestly. He's always been good to me even when he's high. I'm really worried, but I don't have anything negative to say about him. - Even if it's for his own good? - Isn't there another way? - I'll talk to him privately. - I tried that, Turtle. Exactly. We all gotta come at him together. - Well, what if it doesn't work? - It has to. Hey, yo, what are you gonna say? You know, I got some business to discuss with you too, E. - I know now is probably not the right time. - Speak, Scott. - Okay, I'm taking Murray down. - What? Yeah. Okay, I know that he is your girl's godfather and I know that you think you like him, but you do not. He is a wrap. - Bullshit. - No, it's not bullshit. I got most of the company with me. I was going to tell you... in fact I tried to tell you, - but with your fiancée and our tension... - Scott, listen to me. - That'll never happen. - It is happening, Eric. - With or without you. - Drama: Yo, baby bro's here! - Come on. - We'll see about that, Scott. - What's this? - Got myself a present. For what? For being me and for not having to answer to you. - What are you guys doing here? - We wanted to talk to you, bro. About what? What the fuck is going on? This is all about a bag of coke? It's a big bag, Vin. You guys are joking? I was having a party and I called our weed guy and I said give me a pound of both. I don't know how you order coke 'cause I don't really do it. - You're not that dumb. - Are you kidding? No, wait... we can sell that, bro. You know you forgot about my son's Little League game, right? Oh fuck. - I was up really late. - Yeah, you kinda went crazy on me. - Crazy? - What, you don't remember? No, I remember. I wanted to hang out, but you were being a pussy. - I wouldn't exactly call that crazy. - You kicked my truck. I did not. Vince, you know I came out here for myself, but now I see there was maybe a bigger purpose for my visit. The ex-addict who I invited into my home has come down from God to save me? From what? Oh, let's see. I forgot to go to your son's baseball game? I mean, why a movie star has to show up to an eight-year-old's baseball game is beyond me. But hey, I guess that's Hollywood, right? Did I wake you up last night? I'm so sorry. - And what did I ever do to you, Turtle? - Nothing, Vin. - Or you, Johnny? - Nothing. So why the fuck are you all here? Oh wait, let me guess. E orchestrated it. E's worried about me. E's always worried that his golden goose is going to implode. Take it easy, Vince. It was my idea. That's really disappointing, Johnny. Because I'm fine. I just had an argument with my girl and I'm a little upset, okay? That's all! - I know, I talked to her. - Really? And what did she say? She said you went crazy on her too, Vince. She doesn't want to speak to you anymore. Good. Because I don't really want to speak to her either. - Or any of you. - All: Vinnie... Vince, come on. No, I'm serious. I'm gonna go for a walk. And I know you all need me, but I'll call you if I need any of you. Ahem, well, Pete Berg's office called and he needs to be at the studio tomorrow for a camera test. So which one of you losers is going to make sure that he gets there? You're the most powerful agent in town, Ari. Why don't you make sure he gets there? - How is she doing? - Marci: She's a little better. But she's... drunk. - Drunk? - Yeah, and she wants to go to Vegas. Tomorrow she can go to Vegas. Tonight I need her here. Marci, get off the phone. You look like my douche of a husband. Okay. I'm doing the best I can. Do better and I will put your kids through college too. Bye, Ari. Johnny, I'm fine. I got a room at the Roosevelt. Bro, I'm sorry. It was all out of love. - Please come back. - I just want to be alone right now. I don't think you should be. I'll call you if I need you. Hold on. Man: Room service. Coming. Hey, Mr. Chase. Hey. What the hell is up with the music? Sorry about that, Mr. Chase. There's a party. - Oh yeah? Any good? - It's Eminem's. - Can't imagine it isn't. - Well, I'll probably head up there. - All right. - See ya. I'm sorry I couldn't say more and let's obviously keep the Vince stuff on the DL. Turtle, look, if Vince is going to be the face of Avión, then obviously we don't want to hurt his name either. No disrespect, but you guys are hurting everybody. This tequila is authentic because as corny as it may sound - it's made with love. - That's corny as shit. Maybe it is, but you know what? Carlos makes a great product and without him, we're just another brand. - I think he likes Carlos. - I think he loves him. I don't know if I like Carlos or not, but I think we need him. I think we could use him. He's a personality. And to be honest, he'll sell the product better than Vince will. Like Juan Valdez did for coffee. Like Aunt Jemima did for syrup. Like that "Where's the beef?" lady did for whatever the fuck she was selling. The only difference is Carlos is the real deal. - Juan Valdez. - Aunt Jemima? Turtle, this is about your girl, right? This is gonna kill me with her, Mark, yeah. That's a shame, because she's a keeper. - She's too good for him. - Thanks, Ken. Look, Turtle, I like you. I hate Carlos, but I like you. So I'm gonna give Carlos his $5 million to build his factory, no strings attached. And if he hits his numbers there'll be more money behind that. But if you fuck me, you know what's going to happen? Mark's gonna make Gordon Gekko look like Mary Poppins. I will never forget this. Neither will I, Turtle. You're not nervous, are you? No, why? Do I seem nervous? Yes. A little bit. I had a rough day at the office. It's the last thing you need, isn't it, for your star client to be strung out on drugs? Sloan told you about that? Yeah well, he's actually my best friend too, so I'm really more concerned on a personal level. Of course. Well listen, I've been speaking to your boss. - Who, Murray? - Mm-hmm. He tells me that you're quite an asset to the company. - Oh, I appreciate that. - Yeah! Listen. You've signed a few clients, Vince's brother, for instance. Yeah, we got him a cartoon set up. It should be pretty big. Looking beyond your friends, do you see any growth here? Yeah, I've signed a lot of good clients this year. Murray's worried about you. He... he's not sure quite how to keep you motivated. - He said that? - Mmm. - Murray's never even there, Terrence. - He's worried about you, Eric, - as am I. - What are you worried about? My daughter. Aside from the fact that she's blessed by my incredible gene pool, she's also blessed with an awful lot of my money. - Right? - Well, I'd hate for that money to give you any less incentive to really work hard. Terrence, listen, I'm not interested in Sloan's money. - I make my own. - This is great! - It's gonna be easy. - What's gonna be easy? I'd like you to sign a prenup. Everything looks nice, right? It looks nice. Ari, relax. It's smashing. Thank you. - Babe? - Mm-hmm? - Is there any absinthe? - I don't know. Ari? Uh, I will ask the bartender. And when is this party starting? - Ari? - Uh, any minute. Any minute. You're... you're really gonna marry her? She's terrific. The tension's getting to her. The tension is getting to her? What tension? Oh, the... "Where's the guest of honor" tension, that one. - Any minute, okay? - Are you sure? - Believe me I am sure. - Ari? - She's here. - She's here, okay. Places, everyone, places. As soon as we yell surprise, you start singing "Beautiful. " - Got it. - All right. Is there any way I could get you to listen to my demo? Uh, let's wait till after the surprise, okay? Surprise! Where is she? Can I talk to you in private? Ari, it's 9:15. You asked me to do an hour. Please play longer. I know I can't pay your fee, but I'll give you the deed to my house. That's still not going to cover it. I want your Lakers seats for the playoffs... all of them. Done. You give me a Grammy-worthy performance and I'll get Kobe Bryant to sing at your birthday. Uh-huh. I'll believe it when I see it. - What's going on? - She's not coming. - I had to tell her. - What, why? Because she was coming here to talk to you and I didn't want her walking into an ambush. This is a sign of love. This isn't an ambush. I'm sure that's her. I'm gonna get some of her things. Baby, where are you? I am so sorry, Ari. Honey, I'm sorry. Just please come home. I can't face all those people. I will clear them all out. It will just be you and me. Please, talk to me. I need a break, Ari. A break? From what? From us. I need some space. I'm going to pick up the kids at Stacy's and go to my mother's.

I'm doing a movie with Pete Berg and once upon a time he said we should meet. - Okay. - And here we are meeting. Nice to meet you. Excuse me, have you seen Vincent Chase? Yeah, he's around. Where you at, bro? Yeah, I'd love to, but I have a boyfriend. I have a girlfriend but she fucks other dudes... lots of them. So I figure I can fuck other girls. I thought we were gonna fuck tonight. Oh perfect... we can all fuck. You know what? Why don't you fuck yourself? Aw whoa, you don't have to be a bitch about it. Yo, bro, you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You don't look it. Hey, Johnny, do you want to party or do you want to be a bitch-ass pussy? - Come on, Vince, let's go. - No no no! Mr. Chase, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. - We were just leaving. Come on, bro. - No no. No we weren't. I'm sorry, wh... what did I do? - We've had some complaints. - I'm a guest in the hotel. - And this is a private party. - I'm friends with the band. - So why don't you go fuck yourself? - Yo, Vince. Vince, what up, man? What's the deal? What's up? You tell this guy I'm cool to stay. No, I don't think he's so cool. Oh, look who it is... Minka the tight-ass. - Fuck you, Vince. - Fuck you. - Yo, chill out, Vince. - Fuck you too. Fuck me? Yo, get this dude out of here before I fuck him up. Wow, what, are you too mainstream now to fight your own fights, Marshall? What the fuck's wrong with you, man? Fucking punk! Vince, Vince! Vince! Stop! You honestly didn't know anything about this? No! And I can't believe you would think that. I don't know what to think. And why did you tell him Vince was on drugs? He's my father! - Yet he didn't tell you this? - Eric. Sloan, he treated me like I'm some slacker. Like either of them should talk. They both built their businesses on other people's hard work. You're upset. Let's talk about this when you get home. Okay. Yo, Scott, it's Eric. Fuck Murray, I'm in. That's really good to hear, Eric, but we've been trying to call you. We? Yo. You're kidding. If it wasn't for Jordan Farmar and that guy Kevin Love, - I would have killed somebody. - Drama? Yo. Fuck! - No, I'm good, I'm good. - How's Vince? He's not gonna be on camera anytime soon. Oh my God. - Where are you going? - Out. What do you care? - Hey, bro, let us take you home. - Fuck you, Johnny. - Sasha: Vince. - Fuck you too. - What's your problem? - You guys are my problem. I was fine until you guys pissed me off. Now look, you got what you wanted... I am officially out of control. - Come on, Vince. - Sorry, Mr. Chase, - we just need to finish the report. - Call my lawyer.
