 Rosemary & Thyme (2003â€“2006): Season 1, Episode 3 - The Language of Flowers - full transcript 
 The Caldecott family is turning their estate into a health spa. Rosemary and Laura are asked to restore the decayed grand water cascade of their once famous garden. When the ill-tempered matron of the family is murdered, Laura and Rosemary attempt to expose the killer by reading clues left in the flower garden by its long dead creator.

 (PHONE RINGS) Vincent House Health Spa. 24 hours any day. I'm always available. Mmmm. I find women like to know it's always here if they want it. Mmm. Mmmm. Can you do the job or can't you? Well, it may not be possible to get the water flowing again. It depends really on what we uncover. I'm not sure. Well, either it is or it isn't. Mother, please! Oh!

 The spring might have run dry or changed course. We might have to get a dowser in. Ah, more expense, I presume? What if we clean out the pipe at the top of the cascade? Maybe it's leaking and the water's dribbling away. Could be. How long has it been like this? Oh... Years. You know nothing about it, Jeffrey. Since my husband died. 11 years. Ah. As long as that? I bet it looked terrific when it was working. I've only ever seen one other Fenella Goffe cascade. Yes, she was our head gardener when she designed that cascade. Oh, that was before she was famous. My husband chose the plants later.

 I never cared for them as a matter of fact. I want everything cleared and a completely different assortment planted. Everything? Everything. I'll leave the choice to you. Should they be up there? Oh, no! I say! You! Go back! You're not allowed down here! Don't move. I'll come up. Mrs Walsh, are you all right? Ah! It's broken! I've broke my ankle. I think it's only twisted. May I enquire what you bloody know about it? Those steps are lethal. We could've been killed. Move that stupid woman out! Ah. Nearly there. Nearly there. You'll be all right. Ah! Ow! This whole place is a disgrace. That quarry should've been properly fenced off! You'll be hearing from my solicitors. It...it...it's not a quarry... What's going on? Mrs Walsh slipped and hurt her ankle in the Dell. Badly? No, not really, but it could cost us. And Mother was no help. Oh, this is Laura Thyme and Rosemary Boxer. Of course. My sister, Kate Pritchard. How do you do? We're here to try and restore the Dell. Yes. About time. Before there's a serious accident. All right, all right. I'm going to see Mother. Business and family don't always mix. May I ask ... are you old enough to remember Fenella Goffe? No. Mummy sacked her before I was born. Some disagreement. Mummy's a very easy lady to get into a disagreement with. Oh, dear. Would you like to meet Maggie Goffe, Fenella's daughter? She lives in the village. Oh, yes! Does she follow in her famous mother's footsteps? In a way. She's a florist. She does all the flowers for the spa. Mmm. The Language Of Flowers. Edwin Caldecott? He's my dad. Oh. I found the manuscript in his desk after he died. We published it for Mummy's birthday last month. That's nice. We're all having dinner at Mummy's flat. We do it every week. Why don't you join us? Ooh, that'd be lovely. I'll see if Maggie Goffe can come. She and Mummy appear to have become great mates all of a sudden. The only thing is to offer these people a cash settlement right away. Before they ever get to a lawyer. Oh, rubbish! How long were they booked in for? A week. This was their fifth day. Then just don't send them a bill. They'll think they've died and gone to heaven. I know their type. If they sue, they'll win. The steps are dangerous. My dear Jeffrey, you are giving me a headache. They are not going to sue. I wish you'd let me make my own decisions occasionally. I never interfere with your decisions. Except when they involve my money. I like all my women clients to have at least one massage a day. I'm surprised it's only one, Gary, knowing you. Can we have water lilies? I love water lilies. Not if we get the cascade working. Water lilies like still water. Ah, yes, of course. Oh, look. Excuse me. Are you Maggie Goffe? That's right. We've just been talking to Kate Pritchard about you. We're the gardeners. You must be Rosemary and Laura. That's right. Laura, hello. Rosemary. Hi. Kate phoned to invite me for dinner. I do hope you can come. I'm sure I can if I get these deliveries finished. Pete? Yeah. The ladies want plants for Vincent House. Oh, right. Spending old Frances Caldecott's money? Not many people get a chance to do that. Pete! Come on, we all know how tight-fisted she is. It's not my business or yours either. I hope I'll see you tonight. Just let me finish this. What sort of plants are you looking for? Well, mainly water plants. We're trying to rejuvenate the Dell. Oh, right. Well, we've got a whole water garden laid out round the other side. Can you recommend a good B&B;? I can do better than that. I've got a cottage attached to the nursery ... holiday lets and that. The booking for this fortnight cancelled. I can't afford to have the place standing empty. Sounds good to me. Perfect. Another satisfied client, darling? Not everyone's wife's as tight-arsed as you, sweetheart. (CHUCKLES) You love squidging about in the mud, don't you? Yeah, I do rather. I hate to drag you away, but we ought to get cleaned up for dinner. Oh, right. I'll leave my squidging for now, then. If you squidge and run away, you live to squidge another day. There's an oak door. Aha! And a wrought iron bell pull. So you found it. Come in. Your directions were exemplary. Ooh, thank you. Ah, hello. Hi. Oh, hello. I was er, just leaving, actually. Do you know each other? We met at the nursery earlier today. I've er, put the plants and things out the back. Good. Thanks, Pete. You can find your way out, can't you? Yeah. Sure. I do the cooking for our Thursday dinners. One of the reasons for having them is to make sure Mummy gets one decent meal a week. I don't expect she bothers. Lives on tins of soup. (BELL RINGS) Oh, it must be Jeff. Oh, shall I go? Oh, would you, Laura? Oh, hi. Oh, hello. I'm not late, am I? My mother designed the water garden over at Hawkhurst Park as well. Yes, I know, I'm hoping to see it. Erm, she didn't leave any designs of the cascade here by any chance? Any drawings or plans? Not that I know of. I was only a baby when my mother died. Oh, I'm sorry. (BELL RINGS) Oh, I'll get it! I'm trying to get taken on as a butler. Mrs Croft has booked you again for tomorrow. She was most insistent we fit her in. Yes, she has a back problem. There's no way I'm covering up for you again, Gary. Get a life, Jeff. Oh. Oh. Have we come to the right house? And who's this lovely young lady? Well, this is very nice. Oh, sorry I'm late. Where's Mother? She's not down yet. I'll go and see if she's all right. Mummy usually has a nap in the afternoon. She hates it if you wake her. I hate being woken. She's not in her room. Have you looked in the bathroom? She can't be in the study, can she? Don't come in. Mother's dead. She ... she's been murdered. I couldn't sleep. Neither could I. I kept imagining her sitting there, strangled, while we were sipping champagne a few yards away. Do you want another cup? No, thanks. You're reading that book her husband wrote. Mm. Actually, it's quite interesting. What is the language of flowers, anyway? Apparently, it's a mixture of medieval love poetry and Christian symbolism. And this all got mixed up with a floral code that a Lady Mary something Montagu claims was used to send secret messages in the sultan's harem in Istanbul. Whoo! Then it became all the rage with Victorians, who used to send messages that Mama would not have approved of. All to do with sex, then? Romantic love. Sex. Anyway, whatever it was, I get the impression Edwin Caldecott was rather starved of it. Make sure you get a shot of the hand on the will and the letter in the background. Looks like one of those things you put round young trees, tie them to a stake. Do you want to have a look at this, sir? There's a built-in safe here. It's unlocked. Are all those jewel boxes empty? Why leave the empty boxes? Wouldn't put them in their pockets. Easier to take a handful. Oh, God. It's so awful. No, it's not. Can't you be honest, just for once? You can afford a divorce now. That's what you've been waiting for, isn't it? Is everything all right? Oh, she's fine. We came to see if we should carry on with the work now... Now the old witch is dead and Kate finally gets her hands on the money. The police seem to think that she was in the middle of changing her will when she was strangled. Interesting, n'est-ce pas? I suppose the estate goes to Kate and Jeff. Well, I suppose so too. They are the only children as far as we know. Yeah. Kate was pretty upset about that thing Gary said about getting her hands on the money. Wouldn't you be? It was a horrible thing to say. Right. Can't you get any more in the bucket? If I get any more in I won't be able to lift it. I told you you should eat your greens. He's a nasty bit of work, the husband Gary. Yeah. Mr Slime. I wonder if he's got a record. You are funny. Anyone you don't like, you always think they have a criminal record. Well, you'd be surprised. I might ring my son. Get him to check up on him. And another thing, I can't help wondering about Pete from the garden centre. Why? What was he doing at Frances's flat when we arrived? He was delivering plants. Yeah. And she was strangled with one of the black tree bands that he sells. I don't know. What had he got to gain? I dunno. Mrs Thyme? Yes? DI Taylor would like a word. Oh, right. Can you, er, tell me where you were between five and seven yesterday? My colleague and I were working in the grounds of Vincent House until just before six, when we came back, bathed and got dressed. You were together all the time? Apart from the bath, yes. This partnership with Miss Boxer ... it's a new business I believe? Yes. So? What did you do before? I was a housewife. Before that, I was in the police. Oh, yes? Why did you give it up? I was stupid enough to marry a DI. What was all that about? They think Rosemary and I are jewel thieves. What? Mrs Caldecott's jewellery is missing. And they think you did it? We're known round here as the daffodil desperadoes, apparently. Hi. I was just going up to see Kate. She's not in her office. I just looked. Oh, well, I was going to ask her, but I... I can ask you about the replanting in the Dell. Replanting? Yes. You know your mother wanted us to come up with a new scheme to replace the plants your father chose. Yes. Yes, I remember. Well, do you still want us to do that? Well, I ... I don't know. Yes, yes, I suppose so. Fine. Yes. Tell me ... I wondered, did my mother say anything to you yesterday? Say anything? What about? The police must have told you what they found. No. I'm a suspect, remember? They think Mother may have been making changes to her will when she was killed. She had the old will on her desk and was starting to write a letter to her solicitor. I just wondered if she'd said anything to you about it. Me? No, not a word. Why on earth do you think she would? I didn't really, but... Anyway, since she hadn't revoked the old will, it makes no difference. Hi, Kate. Oh! Shall we dance? Sorry. I hope that's gin in there. I beg your pardon? You look as if you need revving up a bit. Mr Pritchard, if I did need revving up, you would be the last person I would choose to press my accelerator. Have you got any more of these sandwiches? Ooh, oh! Come and see what I found. A lovers' heart. Years old with the letters EC and FC. Edwin Caldecott and Frances Caldecott. Ah. Mm. Mm. Being in love with your husband is not the done thing round here, let me tell you. What do you mean? I saw Kate and Pete up there earlier today. Pete from the nursery? Locked in passionate embrace. That throws a wild card into the works. I wonder if Gary knows. Oh, do we care? Oh, now, listen. Do you know this Dicentra Spectabilis? Oh, so... Dicentra Spectabilis in some areas is also known as Secret Love. Oh, that old load of romantic codswallop. No, no. I'm just looking up all these flowers in the book. Now, wolfsbane, Aconitum Vulparia, now that is known as vengeance. I just don't get it. I'm not saying it's true. I'm just saying it was used as a way of sending secret messages. Now, the campanula over here. The white cultivar of Campanula Carpatica is also known as Funeral Bells and that is used to signify death. Hang on. Are you saying Edwin's choice of plants is sending a message? Well, now you look at these... These little mauve flowers with scented leaves. Marjoram. Yes. Marjoram. Now Oreganum Vulgare. Sweet Marjoram, also known as Dittany... And this is the emblem of birth. So we've birth, love, death and vengeance. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, look the bark has nearly grown over. Look. FG. Who's FG? Fenella Goffe. (GASPS) EC and FG. Edwin Caldecott and Fenella Goffe. So, what if Edwin had an affair... With Maggie's mother! And if he got Fenella pregnant, no wonder Frances let this place grow wild! You can't conceive a child on the strength of a few flowers! No? Well, think about it. So Edwin leaves a secret message, telling the whole world about it? And it's all in this book. And Frances reads it and realised the story he left. A voice from the grave. Mmm. Love, death... birth, vengeance. Now she's dead, we should have approval of everything that's spent. It's not your money. I'm running a business. Kate should get the same amount. Half each, the will says. That's not the point. Of course it's the point. Mrs Walsh only had a twisted ankle. I just should have been consulted. Well, we can't stop the cheque. But when will you be paying what's due to Kate? I wanted you to know we've cleaned the pipes. Later we'll be seeing how the water flows down the cascades and thought you'd like to come and watch. Thank you. I'll come down, if I've got time. Right. Sorry to disturb you. Right. Right. No, it's no good. The water's still draining away. I'll go and turn it off. Maybe this bowl needs resealing. What do you think? Should we use concrete? No, no, the original was clay. It'd be nice to know how it was done. Ooh, fine, great! That gives me the perfect excuse to go and look at the cascade at Hawkhurst Park. Ooh, I'm sorry, I forgot. Matthew is coming here tomorrow. Oh, good. Why would he come here? Maybe he's got something on Gary Pritchard. Yes, but why... I've had a thought. Uh-oh. Do you think... Do you think that Maggie knows she's Edwin Caldecott's child? Come on, we're only guessing. Well, maybe we should ask her. Right! Excuse me, we wanted to check something. There are initials carved in a tree, and flowers ... All right. In a subtle way. I mean, look, if it's true she ought to know. She stands to inherit part of this estate. No, she might possibly have had a claim on Edwin Caldecott's estate, but that's long gone. Oh, you're always so bloody logical! Listen. What if Frances was trying to make things right with Maggie? What if she wasn't cutting Kate and Jeff out of the will, but putting Maggie in? (Jeff asked me yesterday if Frances had said anything to me about changing the will.) He wouldn't be too pleased about giving away a slice of his hard work. Mm-hm. Mm. (SIRENS WAIL) What's going on? We've arrested Mrs Pritchard for the theft of her mother's jewellery. Are you sure? Very sure, Mrs Thyme. Very sure indeed. ROSEMARY: This makes no sense. Why would Kate steal her own mother's jewellery? Some crazy scheme to run away with lover boy Pete? No, no, no. I mean, I think Kate might kill but she would never steal. That makes no sense. Killing's much worse than stealing. It isn't a question of worse or better. It's a question of character. Ah! Iridaceae Pseudacorus. Flag Iris. They'll grow anywhere. Hi, Maggie. Hello. For the Dell. What do you think? Nice. Yes, go on, then. It wasn't your mother who chose the original planting, was it? I don't know. It was Edwin Caldecott. Rosemary and I are having fun looking at the planting and trying to work out the message from Edwin's book. That does sound fun. How about letting me make some money here? Why don't we just stick to the simple classics? Water lilies, water poppies and rushes? We can't have water lilies. Well, you could have frog-bit, though. It's like a miniature water lily. Ooh, right. Yes. Great, they're out the back. It's such a...a sad place. You've been there? Not for years. Now we're getting it cleaned up, you must come. No, thanks. The place gives me the creeps. What made Frances let it go like that, I wonder? I don't have any family reminiscences. When my mother died I went to foster parents. Sorry. I didn't mean to pry. No, it's OK. They were lovely, but... Anyway, I've got to rush. It's nice to see you, Laura. Where is he? What? Right, you! I don't know what she sees in you. You're welcome to her. What are you talking about? You think I don't know about you and Kate? You think you're the first? You can have her. There's nothing going on. I've had it up to here with the bloody family. She doesn't look so high and mighty sitting in a police cell. Cell? You two just couldn't wait for the money. Wait a minute. Oh, you'll be next. They sussed her pretty quickly. You murdering... Is he saying they've arrested Kate? Yes. Was that what you call being revved up? Oh. No, please, please I was er... I was looking for Kate. Mrs Pritchard's been taken into custody. No! I knew it! I knew it. She has that look about her. In the police force we have to work on a bit more than looks, Mrs Boxer. Miss, miss. Call me Rosemary. So er, how did you nail her? Just plodding police work, Rosemary. It's not all glamour. I think you're being modest. And that police work led me to look at every last inch of CCTV footage from every camera in this building. No! That is so clever. Do you know, I would never have thought of that. So what did you find? Well... Look, I'll tell you what... It is rather extraordinary, really. Please. You just watch this. This is the camera outside the front entrance to the health spa. Do you recognise the woman? It looks like Kate. Ten seconds later she comes into her own office. And look what's in her pocket. I'll zoom in. Oh! Why would she be so stupid? She must know there's a camera in the room. After a while, they forget the cameras are there. In her mind, she's not committing a crime here. She's hiding some jewellery. It would never have occurred to her that anybody would look at this. Well, why did you look at it? Well, this a murder enquiry, Rosemary. We look at everything. I just don't see WHY Kate would kill her mother. Well, maybe Mrs Caldecott intended to cut her out of her will. Did Kate know that? I don't know. Maybe Mrs Caldecott said something to her or to her husband. When I find out, I expect to be charging Kate Pritchard with murder. I can't hold her in custody long for theft. Do you know something that might shed a different light on the investigation? You don't want to listen to me. I'm just a squidger. Squidger? Horticultural term, Inspector. Can I do you some eggs? No, I'm fine. I just don't see what Kate could stand to gain from stealing her mother's jewellery. That's easy enough. She wanted us to believe Frances Caldecott was killed in the course of a burglary. Mm-hm. I'm not convinced. What, do you think the police were faking the tapes? No. There's er, something funny about it, though. Is something the matter? You know what's happened, don't you? What? Nick and the tart have broken up. Nick wants to come crawling back. No, no. If your husband wanted to come back he'd have come himself. Oh, he hasn't got the guts to come here himself. That's why he's sending Matthew. Do you think so? Yes. Why else would Matthew come all this way? And how do you feel about that? He's going to get such an earful. Bloody cheek. I'll make sure that's the last you'll hear from that inspector. I thought I'd never see the old place again. Come on. I'll come in with you, just in case. No-one has seen him since our punch-up. Gary? Gone. Thank God. Hello, Mum. Matthew! You look well. Yeah, I'm fine. You? Yes. Yeah, fine. All right for a drink, yeah? Yes, thank you. Well. Well. Nice place this. Mmm. All right, isn't it? Taken your inspector's exams yet? Next year, maybe. Don't leave it too late. Don't worry, Mum, I won't. Listen, this Gary Pritchard. You were right, as always. He's got a record? Certainly has. Arrested twice. What for? Taking and driving away. Oh, is that all? And when was this? 1979. '79? How old was he? 14, 15. Not exactly Jack the Ripper, is he? Well... But er, thank you for coming all this way, anyway. Do you see much of your father? Not much gets past you, Mum. You don't get to be my age... I saw him yesterday as a matter of fact. Oh, yes? He wanted me to speak to you about something. It's about the house. The house? Apparently, the lawyer says that you haven't responded to any of his letters. There's some deed you've got to sign, so as he can sell it. I've got a copy of it here. I mean, he's had an offer on the house, Mum, but they can't wait around for ever... Pen. Just where it's marked with a cross. Wow! Puddling. Clay puddling. That's what you need to stop the leaks. That's based on aluminium silicate, isn't it? I've no idea, I'm afraid. Fenella Goffe probably used local clay. I'll have to find out. It needs to be well compressed. The simplest way is to stamp it down with a strong pair of boots. Thank you. Oh, this is lovely. I only hope we can make the Dell at Vincent House half as wonderful. Tragic thing but no reason to neglect the place, let it grow wild like that. What was tragic? You don't know? Terrible thing, terrible thing. Young woman like that. Same age as I was. Makes a big impression when you're young. What happened exactly? Fenella Goffe drowned herself there. No! Terrible thing to happen. You can feel it there, can't you? A very sad place. (SOBS) Oh! (SCREAMS) Kate! Kate, help. Help! Help, can you get me up? Help me. Help me! What are you doing? Ow! Laura! Rosemary! I'm coming. Stop her! Stop her! I'm coming, Laura. Ow! Hang on, I'm coming! Help! Maggie! I'm coming, Laura. Hang on! I'm coming. I'm here. I'm here. You're safe. You're safe. Kate! My God! I've got you. Just hold on. Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. What the hell's going on? She tried to kill me. Kate? Don't be ridiculous. No, not Kate. Maggie. Your half-sister. What? Maggie? What has she got against me? Maybe you were getting too close to why she killed Frances. Don't tell me you were right about all the hidden messages? I have no idea what's going on here. It's all to do with this book. It's only because it's been published that this has happened. So, when did you know that Edwin Caldecott was your father? Not until ten days ago. Frances told me the whole story. That when she found out Fenella was pregnant, she sacked her, driving her to kill herself. But she hadn't realised her own husband was my father until she read his book. Frances asked to see me. She wanted to say how sorry she was. She thought that would make everything all right. But what did I do? You saw me going in the house when I planted the jewellery. My disguise as Kate fooled you, but I knew it was only a matter of time before you worked out the message in the Dell from my father's book. Thanks to Frances Caldecott I never knew my mother. She drowned herself when I was a baby. Here in the Dell. I'd done nothing to hurt you, Maggie. Why did you steal the jewellery to incriminate me? I made use of a family resemblance. Why shouldn't I? But why? If Mother was going to leave you a share of everything in the will... Only if I agreed not to tell anyone who my father was. You think I'd touch her filthy money? You're under caution. I don't care. She drove my mother to suicide. I hated her. I hate all of you. Come on. Come on. That's enough. OK! Woo-hoo! Oh, yes! Bravo. Well done. Well done. Shame Maggie'll never see it. Not for a while, anyway. You know, I hope after this I don't see plots and conspiracy theories in every herbaceous border. I like flowers to be just flowers. Poor Edwin, I suppose he had no-one to confide in. It's sad that the only outlet for his distress was to leave a secret message in a garden in the hope that someday someone will decipher it. Oh, well, come on. I'll buy you a soda pop. Oh, I missed Matthew. How did you get on with him? Oh, er, fine. And were you right? Did he come with a message from...? Oh, absolutely. And I hope you gave him a flea in his ear. Yes, I certainly did. The biggest flea you have ever seen. Well, in that case I think you deserve a little more than pop. I do, I do!
