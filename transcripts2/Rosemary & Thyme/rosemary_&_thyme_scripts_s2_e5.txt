 -Now, my material of choice for any rock garden has always been tufa. But now, the experts at the studio tell me that tufa is ecologically unsound and I have to use something called harlequin. How it can be ecologically sound to important rock halfway around the world from Australia is quite beyond my poor brain, but answers on a postcard to channel 7. Anyway. Work out how much you're going to need. And if you got any half useful male under your feet, pack him off

 to buy the stuff while you prepare the site. Now the site I've got here is over hung by this rather ugly privet hedge, so, I'm going to trim it back a bit. Personally, I'd never be seen dead using one of these. All right, if you're ancient or disabled, but old fashioned shears are good enough for me. Ecologically sounder too, and you get a bit of exercise, so. -All right, cut! Quin, please. You can't say that. -Why not, Gavin? -You know perfectly well why not. Good and green are the sponsors of this program. -Oh, does that mean good and green dictate

 The program's content? -Of course not. Absolutely not. But it does mean we don't go out of our way to slag off their products. Nick, let's take a break. -She really brings it to life, doesn't she? I loved that book of hers. Almost made me want to take up sailing. Except for the scary bits. -How you doing with that compost, girls? -Won't be long, Gavin. Girls? Awe. -Awe. -Oh, well. Right. Now, three parts gravel to one part loam. -Why did we take this job? -Hunger. -Oh, yes. -I'll take the loam. You take the gravel. -Just a minute, just a minute. That means I'll be doing three times the work you're doing. -Good heavens, I never thought of that. -Rosemary, I need you. -Oh, it's nice to be needed. -You're a brave girl, aren't you? -No, I don't think so. -Oh, I'm sure you are. Listen, I need a favor. You know that commentary I do on the roof? -No. -I did it last week. Of course you weren't here last week, were you? Anyway, now they want me to do it every week. I got up to the top of that scaffolding by the house with a camera and do a resume of all the work we've done. -Right? -Well, I only found out when I did it, I've got acrophobia. -You're afraid of heights? -I nearly died. I had to grab hold of that poor cameraman and do it through chattering teeth. -But I saw you, on one of your trips, climb up a 40 foot mast. -Yes, but it's different at sea, somehow. Or, maybe I've just developed it. Anyway, will you do it for me? -Me? No. No, no, no. Wer-- we're just here in the background, not working. I mean, no. -No, it's all right. I've cleared it with Gavin. -Well, um. -Quinnie? -Yes -Rosie Fitzcarron from the Harold. Gavin said we could do an interview. Uh, yes. -We can make it start now, if you'd like. Is there somewhere a bit quieter? -Oh, yes ok. Gavin will explain it all to you. -Ah, yes but no. But i-- What? -You can't just pull out now. -Well, I'm sorry. -But you've signed a contract. -So sue me. -Look, Mr.fitzsemore, you and your wife both agreed to make occasional comments on film about what we were doing. -You'll have to do with that, that's all. You've got our garden, make do with that. I'm a busy man. -W-what about Crystal? My wife is even busier than I am. -Can't do this. What's going on here? -You're going to be a star. -I don't want to be a star. -Yes you do. Think of all the champagne and shopping. -You're only jealous. -No, what? -Well then, you do it. -No. They want you. Anyway, I don't like champagne. -Oh, it's not compulsory. -Oh, yes it is. Now you have to sign a thing. Look at that eucalyptus. -Rosemary, you're trying to change the subject. -No I'm not. They have them all over southern Australia. Mmm. I used to love the smell of them. Hello Crystal. -How are you? -Hello. Um, you haven't seen my husband anywhere, have you? -Oh, um, I think he's with Gavin. -Look, Gavin hasn't told me anything about this. -This is not my problem. I'm not doing interviews. Ask. I've got you and Crystal scheduled for this afternoon. -Vernon? I need to talk. -Look, 'cause Crystal's here-- -I need to talk right now. -Can we just-- -forget it. Alright? -Crissy? -Yes? -I've got a nice jacket in the bag somewhere. I haven't unpacked. -Oh, it's open. -No, I locked it. I know I locked it. -It's been forced. Look. They don't seem to have touched anything. -Yes they have. My laptop's gone. -It's a bit different from single handed yacht Racing, isn't it? -Well of course it is. -I mean, working with a team must be a new experience for you. Are you a team player, do you think? -There's a job to be done. I just get on and do it. -When Douglas Harrington left to go with the bbc, there was a tremendous reaction from his all his fans. Do you think and replace doug in their affections? -It's not a question of replacing Douglas. I'm a different person. The viewers will just have to get used to me. -So they can like it or lump it? -That's not what I said. -And now, he's saying he won't do the interviews. Not only that, but the Dorell woman is making me look a fool and I won't have it. She's-- She's only on the show because she's an alleged celebrity. She's totally unsympathetic, cold, she talks down to the audience. No, you listen. You know what she's doing now? She's knocking our sponsor on camera! Look. I've been making this program for eight years. I could have gone with Douglas when he left but you persuaded me to stay. You said I could have anything I ask for. Well I didn't ask this woman. I don't need this woman. And I want her off my program. Frankly, either she goes or I do! -If I were you, I wouldn't tempt fate like that. -What do you want? -What's that woman doing on the set? -I don't know what you're talking about. -Oh, don't pretend that you didn't know. -Know what? -That Rosie fitz-anyone. She's interviewing Guinnie Dorell. -That has nothing to do with me. -Hey, so it's just a coincidence, is it? -Ask the press office. -I intend to! -First of all, mention demolishing the gazebo and, Uh, clearing that whole area. -Is that comfortable? -Um, ah yes, that's I don't know. I think it's fine. Now look. What about my laptop? -I'll get on to the police. -Now, Guinnie will have already introduced you. We'll film that a bit later. -Yeah right. Ok. Now the thing is, I mean all my work is on that laptop. And it should have been safe. We parked it in the drive. -Sure. Don't worry. We'll get it back for you. Now, uh, if you'd like, you can have a board up there with all the main points written on it. -No. No, no, no. I'll remember. It's the, um, the gazebo cleared and, no. The gazebo demolished and the area cleared. -Yeah. -I can do that. -Say something about the whole shape of the garden becoming clearer, then move onto what you've planted this week. -We are not running away. -I'm not saying you should run away. -I will not visit some vicious little tart. -Hello. -Oh, hello there. You haven't met my son Zach, have you? -Oh, how do you do? -Hello. -Zach's going to med school in september. -Meanwhile, I'm ... I'm a porter at the local hospital. -Do you get danger money for this? -On the channel 7 show? You get a lovely view up here. -Probably have to redo last week's too. Quinnie was sweating so much, they won't be able to use it. She could've said she was scared of heights. -Well I don't think she knew, actually. -Hopefully you don't go the same way. -Oh, no, no. I used to do rock climbing. Now. -I thought you were doing an interview. -I had to stop before I killed her. -Why, what did she say? -Oh, just the usual. What does a poor ignorant sailor girl know about gardening? Haven't you got a nasty, cold personality compared with dear old Douglas Harrington? -Oh, that's awful. How's she getting on up there? -I don't think they've done anything yet. -So the, oh, the gazebo demolished, and this area cleared. -Are you going to point like that? -Yes, well I thought so. Is that all right? -Sure. -Um-hm, yeah. And then I thought, um, I would-- I would um, lean casually on the rail, like this. -You want to just run-- run it through for us, Rosemary? -Uh, yes, ok. Ok. Right. -Quiet please for a rehearsal! Go ahead, Rosemary. -As you can see, ah, the old gazebo is gone. And, uh, we have used some of the old stone uh, to extend The terrace here. Um, now you can, uh, you can, you can, um, you can see how The original garden used to be. -Ambulance! Get an ambulance now! Fetch the nurse! Go on! -Excuse me. Excuse me. My friend came in about an hour ago. Could you tell me what's happening to Ms.Boxer? -Are you a relative? -Uh, uh, business partner. -Well, she's gone up to theater. -What for? -She's got concussion but she's also got a broken tibia. -Is she going to be alright? -She'll be in here for a week or so. -Don't you just put plaster on it? -It's not a straightforward break. -Go on then. You find them. -How can I find them? -If they dropped out, they dropped down here somewhere. -If they were there in the first place. -Are you saying I didn't bolt that clamp properly? -Oh come on, pete. All I'm saying is that even if the clamp was bolted on, it can't have been bolted on properly. -And all I'm saying is, show me where the bolts fell out. It's been bloody sabotaged, that's what. -Rubbish. Look, the health and safety man's going to be here in half an hour. We've got to find some answers by then. -I've just come to collect some things for miss Boxer. She's in hospital. -Oh, yes? -Could I have a key, please? -Thank you. -Oh, you're with that film lot, aren't you? -Yes. -Could you give this to miss Fitzcarron for me? She left it on the counter here this morning. -Fitzcarron? -Lady from the Harold. Only it's her address book. I'll bet she needs it. -Right-o. -Oh, Laura. How's your friend? -Broken leg and concussion. -But she will be all right then? -Yes, yes. She'll be fine. -We have been so worried about her. Haven't we, Vernon? -Oh, geez, yeah. Really worried. -Right, well. See you later. -Bye. -I don't know how badly hurt she is yet. She may be able to do it tomorrow. -That leg didn't look too good. -Is anybody sitting there? -Sit down, Rosie. Well, let-- Let-- let's see if we can at least get the .... -She's not as tough as she makes out. -Who? -Well the wonderful Guinnie Dorell. For ten minutes, she was in full retreat. -Well done, you. -She called the whole thing off. -That's not much good. -I've got more than enough. Don't you worry. -No, no, no. No, Gavin said that I should phone just to check. I see. You didn't? No, no, no. Of course I won't, no. But the Harold, they hadn't, they hadn't arranged anything with you? Hmm. Yes, of course I know how influential she is, yes. Thanks, verity. See you soon. -Could you put all these sacks of regis over there? They're for the lowest strata. -Right. And, and what about these euphobia? -Uh, those go with the hebes. The stuff that's going to be more exposed on the top. I feel terrible about Rosemary. -Not your fault. -I was the one who persuaded to go up there. -You couldn't have known. Someone said there's going to be a Health and safety inquiry. -I'm not being paranoid am i? But if somebody tampered with that scaffolding, they were trying to kill me, weren't they? -No, no,no. -It was shear chance I wasn't up there when it happened. -But who would want to kill you? -Gavin Patterson. He's wanted me off the show ever since I got here. -He's not going to kill you though. -Well what then? If someone wasn't trying to kill me what? Someone knew I wasn't going to be up there and was trying to kill Rosemary? -No, that doesn't make sense either. -Gavin! Have a word, please? -Right. Uh, see if she's ready to finish off That shot, will you? We-- we'll do the hedge trimming on the terrace. We'll get a better view of the house from there. -Sure. -Yes, Penny? -I've spoken to verity in the press office at channel 7. It seems that Fitzcarron has absolutely no authorization For being here. What are you talking about? -I'm not having this, Gavin. I'm not having your bits on the side flaunted in front of everybody. I'm the associate producer on this production-- -don't give yourself airs. You're called associate producer because you're my wife and it keeps the tax inspector happy. -All right, chaps. Let's get his shot in the cam. Stand by everybody! -Need a rehearsal, Guinnie! -Um, I don't know where the hedge trimmer's gone. Where's the bloody hedge trimmer, nick? -It was there a minute ago. Someone must have moved it. It was there a minute ago. The cable's here. -Well what we need is the appliance attached to the end of the cable. -I do wish people would leave props alone. Oh my god! -She was here to do some interviews, wasn't she Mr.Patterson? -Yes, yes. Just the one with Ms. Dorell as far as I know. You'd have to ask her paper. What was she doing with a hedge trimmer? -It's possible that there was a third party involved. That's the hypothesis we're running with at the moment anyway. That she was pushed into the swimming pool and somebody threw it into the water after her. -Good god. I mean, how long is this going to take, inspector? -Well sir that's-- -I don't mean to be callous, but I've got a production to run here. Eh, ugh, god knows what the insurance position will be in a case like this. -This miss Dorell, sir. Quinnie Dorell, isn't it? -Yes, yes. It is that woman who sailed around the world and all that. -Ah yes, yes. Didn't she write a book about it? -2. Yeah. She's a wonderful person. A real professional. I mean, she does have her problems. They're seeing Gavin now. They want to question everyone. -They don't think it was an accident? No, they think someone pushed her into the pool and then Switched on the hedge trimmer and threw it in after her. It would electrocute her. They want to see you next. -Ah, Guinnie Dorell? -Yes. -Sit down, please, miss Dorell Guinnie, is that Um, short for something? -Quintilla I was my parents fifth daughter. My father was feeling beleaguered. What can I do for you? -We believe that you are one of the last people to see Rosie Fitzcarron alive. I don't know. I don't know when she died. -She came down here to interview you, yes? -Yes, that's right. Did you arrange that? -No, it was arranged through the production company. -Only we've been playing over the tape that she Made of your interview. -Yes? -Well, you broke the interview off after 10 minutes or so. -Well, yes I did. She was being impertinent. -You know, I think I'm the prime suspect with the police. -No, surely not. I um, gonna go back to the hotel. Do you want a lift? Nothing more to do here. -No. Ok. What was that you were reading so avidly? -Rosie Fitzcarron's address book. -Is it considered polite to read somebody else's address book? -It is if they're dead. -How did you get hold of it? -She left it at the hotel. Hmm, that's funny. There's a number here with the letters b q b, and a question Mark after it. -She wasn't sure she'd got the number right. -No, if you're not sure of the number you put the question Mark after the number, not after the name. This is very definitely after the name, look. What's bqb, anyway? Bank of quick bucks? British quilting board? -Search me. Look, I'll go and tell them I'm going back to The hotel with you. I'm in need of some sustenance. I'll see you at the car. -Penny! Penny! What the hell have you got us in to? -Oh, shut up, Gavin! -Don't you talk to me like that! -Let go! Is this the truth all coming out at last? -I told you, there was nothing between me and Rosie! -It hardy matters now, does it? -If you thought this was some sort of mad way of getting me Back-- -What? What are you talking about? -You murdering bitch! -You get! You are insane! There's something here. I need it down a bit. -That there? Is that the one? -Is this your first day up? -Ah, yes. It's amazing how quickly they get you up these days. -You hear what happened at the house? -The house? -I'm Zach. I live up there. Crystal Pitt-Seymour's my mom. -Oh, I see. Oh, I di-- I didn't know. -Some journalist got killed. -Yes, i-- I heard. Isn't it terrible? Fell in the pool with an electric hedge trimmer. Yes, I know. -See you later. -I need to make a phone call. -Of course. -So, how long do they think you're going to be in there? -Well, another week at least about. -Oh, I see. -Sounds awful. A journalist in the pool. -Yes, terrible. -Freak accident? -No. No, they think it was murder. -Well, who would want to murder her? Ha, almost everybody, From all I've heard. -Yeah, well that's true. Oh, I came across an article by her in a magazine today. By who? -Rosie Fitzcarron. No! -Talking about her travels in Australia. What, recently? -Well, I just thought that maybe, that's where she met the Pitt-Seymours. I'd be surprised. -Yes, I know it's unlikely, but-- ow! Are you alright? -Any news of my laptop yet? -No sorry. -Well, keep on at them, please. -Yes, of course I will. -I'm lost without it. -Quinnie thinks the police suspect her. -I don't think that's likely. -No, I don't either. -Well, she does speak her mind. -Well, she did say she wanted to kill Fitzcarron. -We all say things like that. -Can never tell. -I've got to go. Tranquilizer time. -Oh, all right. -Call me tomorrow. -Yep. I'll ring you tomorrow. -Bye. -Sleep well. -Bye. -Oh, Nick. Good morning. What's going on? -Nothing, as far as I know. We're not shooting today. I mean, look at it. Penny and Gavin are still at the hotel. -I meant to ask you, how well did Gavin know Rosie Fitzcarron? -Don't you start. Inspector thing badgered me about that. Hi, Vernon. Be like that then. Nah, the truth is, I have no idea. Penny is convinced they were hopping into bed with each Other everyone at every opportunity. That's why she wormed her way in as associate producer. To keep and eye on him. -He did seem rather chummy, Rosie and he. -They would. She was mad keen to get into television. She wanted him to produce a show with her as star. One of those investigative things, with Her being under cover. "Rough house with Rosie" or some such. -Was he going to do it? -He strung her along. Why not? Only Gavin hasn't got as much clout as She seemed to imagine. -Who would want Rosie Fitzcarron dead? -God knows. -Well, you for a start. -Darling, I learnt long ago to ignore the press. -Penny Patterson? Because she thought Rosie was having it off with her old man? -What a revolting thought. Anyway, why would Penny think that Rosie Fitzcarron was going to be on the scaffolding? -Forget the scaffolding for a minute. What was that the assistant director said about her being under cover? -Oh, she wanted Gavin to produce some crappy tv show for her. -Oh, is that what she did? Investigative journalism? Working undercover, pretending to be someone else? -I don't know. You could ask her newspaper. Perhaps someone here had something to hide. Was you she came to see. -What's that smell? -Oh, a eucalyptus tree. -Oh, yes. It's horrible. -I quite like it. It, ah, it-- it-- it reminds me of something. Now I can't remember. I'm off. -Where are you going? -I'm going to see Crystal Pitt-Seymour. Rosemary said Rosie had been in Australia recently. -So. -Maybe there's a connection. -Can I come? -Ah, yeah, sure. -I've got to clear my name, remember. -Come in. Come in. -Do sit down. So, how's your friend, Laura? -Oh, Rosemary. Well she's as well as could be expected I suppose. -Vernon I were thinking of phoning her, and then we thought, no. She probably needs her rest. -Yes, quite. And then all this dreadful business with the journalist. Rosie Fitzcarron had spent some time in Australia. Did you know her there? -Australia is a very big country. -That's a fairly meaningless answer, isn't it? -I beg your pardon? -Maybe your husband, might-- -Vernon? Oh, I wouldn't imagine so. But, he's in town at the minute. You can certainly ask him yourself when he get's back, but I think he would've mentioned it. When was she there? This journalist girl? -I don't know. Year ago. -Oh, well, there you are you see. Vernon and I haven't been in Australia for, um, 5, 6 years. -Have you read any of Rosie's columns? -No, I don't think so. Who did she write for? -The Harold. Well then no, we wouldn't have. We only read the broadsheets. -Aren't you going to wait around for Vernon? -No. I can see him tomorrow. I'm going to go and see Gavin about about town. -Right. I just remembered what that smell of eucalyptus made me think of. -Vicks vapor rub. -No. No-- I was talking to Rosemary, and she was saying how it reminded her of Australia. -And? Now, it be-- listen now-- Just at that moment, we bumped into Crystal. Crystal Pitt-Seymour. -Where do they get these names from? -She would have heard what Rosemary was saying. -And? I don't know. Can I say something? -Suppose I say no. -Are you coming with me to see Gavin? If he's the one who is trying to kill me, I think I've got a Right, don't you? -Mmm, well, when we talk to him, let's be very laid back, shall we? What do you mean? -Well you usually get more out of people if you're quite casual about things. You don't have to necessarily jump in right away and ask the question you really want to ask. -Like I did with Crystal. -Yes. Yes, yes that-- that's quite a good example as a matter of fact. -I don't think I do casual. -Don't forget now. Laid back. -Right. Laid back. -Insouciant. -I definitely don't do insouciant. -Come in. Just put it on the dressing table, will ya? -Oh, do buck up, Gavin. -What do you want? -Just a, social call. -Did you know that Rosie Fitzcarron had spent some time in Australia? -What's that got to do with anything? -We just wondered if you knew why she was there? -Writing her god awful column for her god awful newspaper, I presume. Of course, Gavin's the expert on Rosie Fitzcarron. -Penny. She was very excited about some book she was going to write. -About Australia? -Some financial scandal. She wasn't exactly forthcoming. Not what I heard. -So, you don't know any details? -No. -There's something extremely creepy about those 2, isn't there? Not exactly creepy, maybe a bit uncomfortable though. -The way he just lay there, all exposed. -At least he hadn't kept his socks on. -Hm, hm, hm. Do you think they were going to, um-- -Oh, please. I've just had lunch. -You know about that eucalyptus, about me saying Crystal Pitt-Seymour could've overheard Rosemary and me? -Yes. -Keeps nagging at me. What if she was expecting someone from Australia, and She heard Rosemary talking about her time there-- -What? She was expecting just anybody who'd been to Australia? -Well no, but someone she didn't know. -I don't see how she could be expecting someone she didn't know. -Oh my god, look! -It's a car on fire! -It looks like Vernon's car. -God, how did it happen? -I don't know. I just saw the smoke. The driver's still in there. -No, we were just driving along and, and we saw it. -You didn't see it happen? -No. -It was Vernon driving, was it? -Looks like it. We still haven't made a positive identification. But um-- -You sure she's going to be all right? -I'll get her home. -Crystal, Zach, I'm so sorry. -Have you still got that address book? -Oh, Rosie Fitzcarron's, yes. In my bag. -Can I have a look at it? -Sure. -Where's that loose piece of paper? -Ah, um, right in front there. -Yes, I knew it. This is the Pitt-Seymour's home phone number. -That's very clever of you. -No, it was on the call sheet for the film unit. -Of course. -So, why does it say b q b? -What is b q b? -Look! -Bqb! -Brisbane and Queensland bank, of course! That big fraud thing that happened about 10 years ago. -Oh, yes! -Someone who worked there, uh, some junior executive. He went missing with about 10 million quid. -Yes, that's right. Then he died, didn't he? -I don't think they got all the money back. -They got some of it. He transferred it to banks all over the world. Oh, what was his name? -Well, he's dead anyway. -But the money must have gone somewhere. Do you think the Pitt-Seymours could've been involved? -Come on. Gavin said, Rosie was writing a book about some financial scandal. Now what if it was this bqb thing? -What, and she linked the Pitt-Seymours to it somehow? -Yes. They somehow got hold of the money after John Lundgren-- John Lundgren! That was his name. -Of course it was. -Well, what if they, after he died, they Inherited the money? -There's no one home. Crystal and the boy left about half an hour ago. The police say they're going to be finished here by tonight. We'll just have to work sunday. May you live in interesting times. Old chinese curse. -We know they're not there. Oh, sugar! Double sugar! Rather you than me. -But you're so lissom. -Thank you. -No sign of life as far as I can tell. What exactly are we looking for? -We'll know it when we find it. -Oh, good. -What? -Bingo! Rosemary's computer! -No! Why would they steal that? -Well, they thought that Rosemary was Rosie Fitzcarron, And they wanted to find out what Rosie Fitzcarron was writing. Someone's been burning stuff. -Oh, anything interesting? -It's still warm. Ah, something here. It's a little book. It could've been a passport. -Oh, yes, it could. -Hang on a minute. There's a whole sheath of stuff here that hasn't burned properly. Alright, this ones a bill. Here's a letter. Dear old Maggie, who's Maggie? Blah, blah, blah-- The good news is that I'm now head of the pacific rim investment department. How about that? And den hargreves didn't get a sniff. Listen to this! -I am listening! -Oh, incidentally, we had an english journalist, Rosie something, sniffing around about the Lundgren affair recently. I told her to look you up as you knew the late unlamented Johnny, worked in his department, et cetera. -What did John Lundgren die of, do you remember? -No. Oh, wait a minute. They never found a body, did they? Something to do with a boat. -Oh, the Aurora. John Lundgren didn't die! -Vernon Pitt-Seymour is John Lundgren. -I'll tell the police. See you at the car in 3 minutes. -What? -Go! Excuse me! -May I ask a question? -Go on. -I mean, I don't wish to appear forward. -Ask away. Where exactly are we going? -Oh, um, we're going to find the Pitt-Seymour's boat. The Aurora. -But where? We're miles from the sea. -They may have moored it near the house. There was a notice behind Vernon in that photograph that said Bridmouth canal. And that takes you straight out to sea. -Clever. Wait! There's a lock! -Thank god the locks full. -Oh goody. Nothing worse than and empty lock. -Can we use that chain off the back of your car? -Um yeah, I'll get it. Here. -Thanks. Keep a look out for the Aurora. -Aye, aye, captain. -Up stream, you fool! There's a boat coming! -Is it the Aurora? -It could be. -Go and hide. -Are you sure? -Yeah. Go on. I'm nearly done. -There's only another 3 locks between here and the coast. What now? -Now, we become gongoozlers. -Oh, right. -What did you tell the police? -Everything. They're starting downstream and working their way up. -Thanks darling. -Now what happens? -They start to sink. -Open it up, Zach. -Now the fun starts. -Vernon, this ones chained up! -What do you mean, it's chained up? -It's locked! -Who the hell has done this? She'll get through that. -I don't think so. -Yeah she will. Come on. Get in the boat. -Can they make it through just one side? -I don't know. It depends on the beam. -Come on, come on! Thanks doll. Now, we can do it. We can do it! -We can't! -Vernon, it won't go! -Well it's bloody got to! Alright! Alright. Everyone off the boat. -That's as far as you go, Mr.Lundgren! -What the hell are you doing? -What am I meant to do? -Rap him on the knuckles. -Yeah, you wouldn't dare. -Try me. Warned you. -That'll do, now. -Whew! So, Crystal, real name Maggie Malard, got the letter from her friend at bqb a few days before. The remains were still in their fireplace. -That must be why she and Vernon had started to get nervous about having such a high profile, and decided to Quit the show. -That's right. And then she heard you talking about being in Australia and smelling the eucalyptus. -Oh, so she assumed that I was the real Rosie Fitzcarron-- -undercover. -I suppose the similarity of names clenched it. Rosie, Rosemary, so, she had to get rid of you. -Bloody hell. -Then, the real Rosie Fitzcarron turned up, Crystal Saw her mistake, and so she had to do it all over again. -But who was the body in the car? -Zach's put his hand up to that one. Stole a body out of the morgue here. -An example to us all. Here's to family values. -Standby, everybody. Roll tape. And action. -Of course there will be those troublemakers among you who will be asking why I haven't top dressed this rock garden with gravel or stone chippings or some such. Top dressing has its advantages in that it helps drainage and inhibits weeds. But it never looks right, does it? If you've used the right soil mix, it'll drain anyway. And if you're too idle to get down on your knees and weed, well you've no business watching this program, have you? See you next time. -And cut. Thank you, Guinnie. That's great. Really fantastic. That's telling them aye? -Well. Thank you, Gavin. -Hate it when he tries to behave like a human being. -I think he's realized which one of you is indispensable. -How's Rosemary? -She's fine. She's glad to have her computer back. I think we did rather a good job of this rock garden, don't you? Can I ask you one thing? -Um-hm, what? -What is a gongoozler? -Oh, that's narrow boat talk. A gongoozler is someone who loves to stand and watch hopeless land lovers try to cope with a lock. -Right. Only bit of nautical slang I know are three sheets to the wind, and come in, number three, your time's up. -All one needs really. -Oh, and um, splice the main brace. What do ya think? -Oh, yes.
