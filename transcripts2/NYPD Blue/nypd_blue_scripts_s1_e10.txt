NEVERTHELESS, YOUR FAILURE TO REPORT THE MARINO APPROACH WAS AN ILLEGAL ACT. HOWEVER, YOU HAVE COME FORWARD NOW. YOU HAVE REPORTED THIS APPROACH BY LINARDI. THE APPROACH WAS BY SOME GUY NAMED RICHIE. I THINK WE'RE SAFE IN ASSUMING YOUR CONTACT WORKS FOR LINARDI. I'VE DECIDED YOU CAN CLEAR YOUR BOOKS WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON THE MARINO MATTER... IF YOU COOPERATE IN DOCUMENTING THIS CURRENT SOLICITATION BY LINARDI, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OF HIS WHICH MAY COME TO LIGHT. YOU SAID THEY WANTED YOU TO RUN A PLATE FOR THEM. YES. CAN YOU DO THAT? DO YOU HAVE ACCESS AT YOUR STATION HOUSE? YEAH. DO IT. TELL THEM YOU WANT TO MEET. AND WEAR THIS. IT'S A TAPE RECORDER. [ CLOSES DRAWER ] UNLESS YOU'D RATHER WEAR A WIRE INSTEAD. I'D LIKE TO SET UP SOME BOUNDARIES, A TIME FRAME. ONCE THE INVESTIGATION'S BEGUN AND I KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING, I'LL BE BETTER ABLE TO RESPOND TO YOUR CONCERNS. BUT THIS ISN'T OPEN‐ENDED. I DO THIS LINARDI THING, AND THEN I'M DONE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID. NEEDLESS TO SAY, OFFICER, OUR ARRANGEMENTS AND YOUR ACTIVITIES ARE NOT TO BE DISCUSSED. I UNDERSTAND.

JAMES, IF YOU WOULD, MAKE SURE SHE GETS MET, ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. ANYTHING ELSE? NO, NO. MORE OF THE SAME. THIS IS DETECTIVE MEDAVOY, 15TH PRECINCT‐‐ HEY, HOW'S IT GOING? OKAY. MM. YOU SEE LASTARZA? YEAH. HOW'D THAT GO? I'M NOT GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS. BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO. JOHNNY‐‐ LIE TO HIM. LIE TO HIM. HE'S LYING TO YOU. I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO. I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? YOU'RE MY LOVER, AND I DON'T WANT TO GET YOU INVOLVED. OKAY. WHAT IF THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE TO ME? TRY IT. MAYBE YOU'LL GET THERE. [ KEYBOARD CLACKING ] ‐ WHAT DO YOU GOT, JANICE? ‐ THIS CAR'S BEEN PARKED ON MY BLOCK ABOUT A WEEK. I THOUGHT I'D CHECK AND SEE IF IT WAS STOLEN. WHEN YOU DELIVERED THE WATER, DID YOU CARRY IT THROUGH THE HOUSE? HOW LONG WERE THE SLOANS ON YOUR ROUTE? COULD I GET THE NAMES... OF THE DELIVERY BOYS‐‐ [ CONTINUES, INDISTINCT ] AND YOUR DATE OF BIRTH? HEY, UH, DID YOU KNOW THAT NEW YORK CITY TAP WATER... TASTES BETTER THAN BOTTLED WATER? THAT'S NOT ME SAYING THAT. THAT'S INDEPENDENT TESTING. THIS MORNING THIS BAG CONTAINED A LUNCH PREPARED BY MY WIFE FOR ME... NOT THE RODENT POPULATION OF THE 15TH PRECINCT. YOU KNOW, YOU OUGHTA GET ONE OF THOSE METAL LUNCH BUCKETS. I WOULDN'T HAVE TO IF YOU DIDN'T TREAT AND FEED 'EM LIKE PETS. IT'S YOUR FAULT THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY'LL STARVE.

NO SCARS OR DISTINGUISHING MARKS ON HIS FACE OR ARMS... BUT HE DOES HAVE A PIERCED SCROTUM. HE WEARS A LITTLE, GOLD BALL THERE. YOU GOT A GOOD LOOK? OH, YES, FROM ALL ANGLES. WHAT'D HE STEAL FROM YOU? ONE ITEM ONLY, MY OSCAR. MY ACADEMY AWARD. DO YOU BELIEVE IT? THERE WAS BACCARAT CRYSTAL, TWO FABERGÃ© EGGS‐‐ WHAT'S THE OSCAR WORTH? UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I COULDN'T GUESS. WHOEVER BOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE TO KEEP THE TRANSACTION SECRET, WOULDN'T THEY? NOW, DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT THAT WOULD MAKE THE PRIZE MORE OR LESS VALUABLE IN THEIR EYES? MR. RICKMAN, I'D LOVE TO SIT HERE WITH YOU TRYING TO FIGURE OUT... WHAT SOMEONE WOULD PAY TO WHIP HIS SKIPPY WHILE GAZING AT YOUR OSCAR, BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORKING ON A MULTIPLE HOMICIDE. SO, LET'S JUST PUT ITS WORTH AT MORE THAN $500 AND FINISH THIS REPORT, OKAY? FINE. YOU GOT A NAME ON THE THIEF? HE SAID HIS NAME WAS BRYCE. B‐R‐I‐C‐‐ UH, MY GUESS WOULD BE "Y." B‐R‐Y‐C‐E. LAST NAME? IT DIDN'T COME UP. UH, ANY IDEA OF AN ADDRESS? HE'S A TRANSIENT. SAID HE JUST ARRIVED FROM DENVER. YOUR BEST BET WOULD BE TO TRACK HIM THROUGH RAOUL. THE BARTENDER AT LOUISE'S. THAT'S A COME‐AS‐YOU‐ARE SORT OF PLACE FOR PERSONS LIKE MYSELF. THAT'S WHERE BRYCE AND I MET. THAT'S AT 48TH STREET ON THE WEST SIDE, HUH? OH, YOU KNOW IT. [ IRRITATED SIGH ] RAOUL TENDS TO GET ON TERMS WITH NEW BLOOD RATHER QUICKLY. HE MIGHT JUST KNOW WHERE OUR BRYCE HAS PITCHED HIS TENT. ALL RIGHT, HERE. WRITE DOWN YOUR ADDRESS AND YOUR PHONE NUMBER. I'LL GET IN TOUCH IF I FIND ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT? I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR ATTENTION, DETECTIVE. YEAH. I KNOW IN THE SCALE OF YOUR LABORS MY LOSS IS INCONSEQUENTIAL, BUT AS I SEEM TO BE RETIRED FROM THE WRITING BIZ, I DON'T EXPECT TO BE WINNING MORE AWARDS AND I WOULD BE PLEASED TO GET THIS ONE BACK. I‐I, UH, I LIKED THAT ONE BOOK YOU WROTE ABOUT THOSE COPS. DID YOU? YEAH, I CAN READ AND EVERYTHING. HEY, YO, OFFICER LICALSI. GOT THAT THING WE TALKED ABOUT? YOU WANT A RUNDOWN ON A LICENSE PLATE, YOU BETTER SATISFY ME. IT'S NOTHIN' HEAVY. DO BETTER THAN THAT, OR I'M GONNA WALK AWAY RIGHT NOW. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU MIGHT. YEAH, I WILL. IT'D BE LIKE THIS, OFFICER. A BOOKMAKER IN OUR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE MIGHT DEAL WITH AN INDIVIDUAL FREQUENTS A BAR, ESTABLISHES CREDIT THERE WITH THE BOOKMAKER TO BET ON VARIOUS SPORTING EVENTS. THE BOOKMAKER HAS NO HOME PHONE OR ADDRESS ON THIS MAN‐‐ MAYBE NOT EVEN HIS RIGHT NAME. SAY THIS INDIVIDUAL SUFFERS SOME BAD LUCK. INSTEAD OF PAYING OFF HIS DEBTS OR MAKING ARRANGEMENTS LIKE A CITIZEN, HE DISAPPEARS. CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE THAT, WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE BOOKMAKER'S CREDIBILITY, PUT OUR FINGER ON THIS MAN SO HE MAKES GOOD. DOING WHAT TO HIM? I WOULDN'T LET MY IMAGINATION RUN AWAY WITH ME. NOBODY COLLECTS MONEY FROM A CORPSE. ARE YOU SATISFIED, JANICE? YOU READ THE SPORTS SECTION? 'CAUSE YOU'RE ON THE TEAM NOW. TAKE CARE. I'LL BE IN TOUCH. RIGHT OVER HERE.

BUT THE SOONER WE FIND OUT EVERYTHING WE CAN, THE BETTER OUR CHANCES OF FINDING THESE PEOPLE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? [ SIGHS ] WE THINK WHOEVER DID THIS TO YOUR FAMILY HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAYOUT OF THE RESIDENCE. NOW, COULD YOU HELP US WITH PEOPLE WHO YOU MIGHT HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH... CAME TO YOUR HOUSE BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW REAL WELL? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. PEOPLE WHOSE SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC STRATA MIGHT BE DIFFERENT THAN YOURS. MY PARENTS TAUGHT ME NOT TO MAKE THAT KIND OF DISTINCTION. [ SIGHS ] REBECCA, HOW WE WORK A CASE IS WE GO BY WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD. NOW, IN THE REAL WORLD, WELL‐TO‐DO PEOPLE TEND NOT TO BREAK INTO HOUSES, STEAL THINGS AND MURDER THE OCCUPANTS. CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT TYPE OF ACQUAINTANCE? MY MOTHER'S SOCIAL STRATA? BLACK ACQUAINTANCES ESPECIALLY. YES, I HAVE BLACK ACQUAINTANCES WHO DON'T HAVE MUCH MONEY. ANY FROM THE BRONX? WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD THAT MAKE? [ EXHALES ] SEVERAL SIMILAR CRIMES... HAVE OCCURRED IN THE BRONX, IN RIVERDALE. PARTIAL WITNESS DESCRIPTIONS SAID THE PERPETRATORS WERE BLACK. I HATE THINKING LIKE THIS. REBECCA, THESE PEOPLE DID TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE THINGS, AND WE NEED TO FIND THEM. I'M NOT HERE PASSING JUDGMENT ON YOU OR YOUR FAMILY OR ANYONE YOU MIGHT HAVE KNOWN. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO GO ON. IS THERE ANYONE THAT COMES TO MIND? [ SHAKY BREATH ] I WENT OUT WITH A GUY LAST YEAR, LEWIS FUTREL. HE'S FROM THE BRONX... AND HE'S BLACK. IS THAT F‐U‐T‐R‐E‐L? YES.

YEAH, SIT DOWN. YOU KNOW WHY I REACHED OUT TO YOU, SAMMY? BECAUSE US GOING BACK THE WAY WE DO, NOBODY KNOWS BETTER THAN ME THE SENSE OF CIVIC DUTY YOU'RE PACKING. I ALSO GOT MY SISTER'S PUTZ KID RUNNING THE PAWN SHOP WHILE I'M OVER HERE. SO, IN THIS CASE, THE MORE HASTE, THE LESS WASTE. ALL RIGHT, I GOT A STOLEN STATUE, SAMMY‐‐ ONE OF THOSE MOVIE OSCARS. I ALSO GOT A MURDER THAT'S MAKIN' DEMANDS ON ME. I DON'T SEE MY RELEVANCE. [ SIGHS ] SAMMY, WHOEVER THAT STATUE STARTS OUT GETTING PAWNED TO, WE KNOW SOONER OR LATER IT'S GONNA COME AROUND TO YOU, HUH? IN OTHER WORDS, YOU PUNISH ME FOR BEING AN EXPERT ON COLLECTIBLES? NO, I PUNISH YOU FOR BUYING 'EM HOT. NOW, SAMMY, I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT US SWOOPIN' DOWN ON YOUR PAWN JOINT UNANNOUNCED, DOING AN INVENTORY CHECK ON YOUR LEDGERS, PUTTIN' HOLDS ON OUT‐OF‐PAWN ITEMS, DAMMING UP YOUR CASH FLOW‐‐ I'M GUESSING COULD THIS BE... AN OSCAR IN THE CATEGORY OF BEST SCREENPLAY, CIRCA SOMEWHERE AROUND 1958? AH, YOU SEE, YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MENTALIST. I'VE HEARD RUSTLINGS. VERY PRELIMINARY. A COLLEAGUE DIDN'T HAVE THE ITEM YET, BUT HE'D BEEN APPROACHED. HE WANTED TO KNOW A BALLPARK WORTH. YEAH, WHAT WOULD THAT BE? TWENTY‐FIVE. THOUSAND? YOU THINK THAT'S INFLATED? WHEN A MATCHBOOK JOHN LENNON WROTE "SCREW YOU" ON BRINGS IN 15? ALL RIGHT, SAMMY, YOU GET ME THAT STATUE, I'LL OWE YOU A BACK‐SCRATCH. I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED. 1991 PLAY‐OFFS. CORRECT.

YEAH, SHE'S GOT NO RECORD, BUT SHE'S ON TWO DIFFERENT STOP‐AND‐FRISK REPORTS, AND SHE WAS QUESTIONED TWICE DURING DRUG SWEEPS. FLYING JAMES. YEAH, I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING. MY NAME IS LEWIS FUTREL. I'M AN ARCHITECTURE STUDENT AT HUNTER COLLEGE. I LIVE ON 147TH STREET IN THE BRONX. YOU FORGOT YOUR RANK AND SERIAL NUMBER. BLACK MAN DATING A WHITE WOMAN. I GUESS THAT DOES MAKE ME AN AUTOMATIC MURDER SUSPECT. RIGHT NOW, MR. FUTREL, I CONSIDER YOU A MODEL CITIZEN. WHICH IS WHY I WAS HOPING THAT YOU MIGHT HELP US OUT. TWO NIGHTS AGO, I WAS UP UNTIL 3:00 IN THE MORNING STUDYING FOR A TEST. I HAVE WITNESSES. I'LL NEED THOSE NAMES. AND ASSUMING I GET THEM, YOU'RE NOT A SUSPECT IN THESE MURDERS. WHAT I'M MOST INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT IS... DID YOU DISCUSS WITH ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH REBECCA? HER LIFESTYLE, WHAT HER PLACE LOOKED LIKE. ANY OF THAT COME UP WHEN YOU TALKED WITH ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS? OH, I GET IT. I MAY NOT BE A CRIMINAL, BUT YOU GET ENOUGH NIGGAS TOGETHER AND SOME OF THEM MUST BE. MR. FUTREL, REBECCA SAID ONE OF THE REASONS SHE BROKE UP WITH YOU... WAS YOU HUNG WITH KIND OF A ROUGH CROWD. SO, I GO TO THE CRIMINAL NIGGAS, SAY, "GUESS WHAT, I'M BONING THIS RICH, WHITE GIRL. LET ME TELL YOU WHERE SHE LIVES, WHERE HER MAMA HIDES HER JEWELRY." THAT THE SCENARIO YOU ENVISIONED, DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ? MR. FUTREL, HAVE I BEEN DISRESPECTFUL TO YOU? THISIS DISRESPECTFUL. ME BEING HERE IS DISRESPECTFUL. HEY, PAL, YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING TO FIND SOME ASSHOLES BEFORE THEY MURDER ANOTHER INNOCENT FAMILY. IT SO HAPPENS THESE PARTICULAR ASSHOLES HAPPEN TO BE BLACK. NOW, HOW DO YOU WANT ME TO GO ABOUT THIS, HUH? MAYBE I SHOULD START EACH QUESTION WITH, UH, YOU KNOW, "I'M SORRY FOR THE INJUSTICES THE WHITE MAN HAS INFLICTED UPON YOUR RACE, BUT, CAN YOU PROVIDE ME WITH ANY INFORMATION?" OR, "I'M SORRY YOUR PEOPLE ARE DOWNTRODDEN FOR 300 YEARS, BUT, DID YOU DISCUSS THE LAYOUT OF THE SLOAN HOUSE WITH ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS?" YEAH, DO IT LIKE THAT. YEAH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I KNOW THAT GREAT AFRICAN‐AMERICAN GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER... DISCOVERED THE PEANUT, BUT, CAN YOU PROVIDE NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF THESE FRIENDS? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A RACIST SCUMBAG. OUCH. I NEED NAMES OF BLACK FRIENDS WHO MIGHT HAVE SHOWN SPECIAL INTEREST... OR VISITED REBECCA'S HOME WITH YOU. I NEED A PEN. DO YOU WANT A BEER? UH, NO. LOOK, THIS FOLLOWING YOU AROUND THING, OKAY, IT'S BECAUSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU, AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TELLING ME WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I TOLD YOU WHY I WOULDN'T. JOHNNY, I NEED YOU TO LOVE ME, OKAY? IT'S UP TO ME TO TAKE CARE OF ME‐‐ OKAY, LET'S STOP WITH THE WORD GAMES, OKAY? YOU ARE KIDDING YOURSELF. YOU LIE DOWN WITH A SCUMBAG LIKE LINARDI AND A LIAR LIKE LASTARZA. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I'M WORKING ON AN ASSIGNMENT. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU'RE TRYING TO GET CLEAN BY DOING SOMETHING DIRTY. THAT DOESN'T WORK. MEANWHILE, THEY ARE LEADING YOU AROUND TOWN BY YOUR NOSE. JOHNNY, DO NOT DO THIS. I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS. I DO TOO. OKAY, YOU'RE IN TOO DEEP. I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I AM. TALKING TO ME LIKE I'M AN IDIOT DOESN'T HELP THINGS. WHO ELSE IS GOING TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH? THE TRUTH? THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS IS MY LIFE. MINE. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. NOT WITH ME. WE CAN'T MAKE A LIFE TOGETHER, THEN YOU GO YOUR OWN WAY. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN HAVE A LIFE. I WAS IN TROUBLE ONCE FOR STOLEN CREDIT CARDS. THAT WAS THREE YEARS AGO. HOW LONG YOU KNOWN LEWIS FUTREL, LONNIE? WE GREW UP ON THE SAME BLOCK. YOU STILL TIGHT WITH HIM NOW? NAH, I'M NOT TOO TIGHT.

YEAH, MONEY AND ADVICE. THEN YOU ROBBED HIM. IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THAT. IT ALMOST SEEMED LIKE HE WANTED IT TO HAPPEN. I MEAN, HE WAS SO DRUNK, AND HE WAS SHOWING ME THE OSCAR. THEN HE PASSED OUT. YOU DIDN'T BEAT HIM UP? NO! NO. HE WAS ALL BRUISED UP LIKE THAT WHEN I MET HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK HE'S A VERY LONELY PERSON AT HEART, DESPITE THE SUCCESS AND FAME. BRYCE, [ CLEARS THROAT] I THINK YOU GOT A SHOT... AT AVOIDING A TRIP TO NEW YORK CITY'S FAMOUS RIKER'S ISLAND PRISON, WHICH IS A VERY VIVID PLACE INDEED. BUT YOU GOTTA GIVE ME THE RIGHT ANSWER TO THE NEXT QUESTION. THE OSCAR'S IN A LOCKER AT PENN STATION. THE KEY IS IN MY POCKET. IT'S IN A DEAN AND DE LUCA TOTE BAG, ALONG WITH A PAIR OF HIS SOCKS. WHOSE SOCKS? ARLAND RICKMAN'S SOCKS. [ LAUGHING ] THANK YOU. YEAH. THESE BIRDS ARE BOYCOTTIN' ME. I'M THROWING AWAY ALL THIS GOOD SEED. I WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO JOEY O'BRIEN. YOU REMEMBER HIM? YEAH, JOEY O'BRIEN. HIS CAR GOT BLOWN UP. YEAH, WITH HIM IN IT. I WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I THINK THE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING, OFFICER LICALSI, IS DID WE DO IT? THE ANSWER IS WE DID NOT. YOU GONNA CROSS YOUR HEART OR SPIT OR SOMETHING? OFFICER, YOU GOT CREDIT CARDS, RIGHT? TWO, THREE, FOUR, WHATEVER YOU GOT. WOULD YOU IMAGINE USING UP ALL YOUR CREDIT ON JUST ONE CARD, YOUR VISA, SAY? NO. IF YOU WERE FINANCIALLY IRRESPONSIBLE, DESPERATE, WHATEVER, YOU BURN 'EM ALL OUT TO THE LIMIT. NOW THAT'S WHAT JOEY O'BRIEN DID. AND WHAT'S OBVIOUS IS SOME LESS PATIENT AND REASONABLE PEOPLE... GOT TO HIM BEFORE WE DID. IT WASN'T YOU? IT WASN'T US. IS YOUR CONSCIENCE CLEAR NOW? TOMMY SAID TO TELL YOU THANKS FOR THE LICENSE PLATE. HE'S LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING YOU. TAKE CARE. I'LL BE IN TOUCH SOON. DON'T GET CANCER, RICHIE. [ PHONE RINGING ] HERE YOU GO. HEY, DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL ON THE RADIO HOW ARRESTS WERE MADE ON ALL THOSE MURDERS. COME IN TO CONGRATULATE US? I GUESS SOMEBODY WAS DOING SOME REAL DETECTIVE WORK... WHILE YOU STAYED BUSY HARASSING ME AND MY FRIENDS. I'M SORRY YOU TOOK IT THAT WAY. I WANNA HEAR YOU SAY YOU HARASSED ME. I WANNA HEAR YOU SAY THAT ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE NOT SUSPECTS. WHICH DETECTIVE ANDREW SIPOWICZ MIGHT FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE... SINCE HE THINKS WE'RE ALL A BUNCH OF LOWLIFE NIGGERS! ALL RIGHT, LEWIS, YOU'VE MADE YOUR LITTLE SPEECH. YOU'RE DONE NOW. ‐ NO, I'M DONE WHEN I SAY I'M DONE! ‐ I'M TELLING YOU, YOU'RE DONE. I WANNA HEAR ABOUT GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER AGAIN, YOU IGNORANT CRACKER BIGOT. EXCUSE ME, WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS HERE? THIS IS MR. FUTREL, LIEUTENANT. HE WAS QUESTIONED ON THAT SLOAN MATTER. HE WAS CLEARED. SO YOUR BUSINESS HERE IS FINISHED? YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE TO TAKE IT WITH YOU ONE ON ONE SOMETIME. WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR GUN AND YOUR FIRE HOSE AND YOUR BADGE. ‐ LET ME GIVE YOU MY CARD, HUH? ‐ SIPOWICZ. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION, MR. FUTREL. YOU CAN LEAVE NOW. THEY LETTIN' YOU WORK IN THE BIG HOUSE NOW, BOY? WHAT DOOR YOU COME IN? YOU CAN LEAVE NOW, MR. FUTREL. YOU BUSY TONIGHT? I GOT NO BIG PLANS. DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ, I GOT YOUR MESSAGE YOU FOUND IT. Y‐YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU? UH, YEAH, YEAH. COME ON. OH, THANK YOU. HERE YOU GO. WONDERFUL. WELL, I AM VERY GRATEFUL. WE GOT THAT KID IN THE HOLDING PEN. HOW DO YOU WANT TO HANDLE THAT? OH... WELL, I'M NOT INCLINED TO PRESS CHARGES. NO HARM DONE, AS WE SAY, EH? WELL, SUIT YOURSELF. D‐DETECTIVE, COULD YOU ABIDE A GESTURE OF GRATITUDE FROM AN OLD QUEEN? IT DEPENDS ON THE GESTURE. HERE IS THE BOOK OF MINE YOU SAID YOU HAD ENJOYED. WELL, I SIGNED IT FOR YOU. YOU KNOW, I BET, UH, WHEN YOU WROTE THIS... YOU WEREN'T HANGING OUT AT BARS MIDMORNING, PICKING UP DOUCHE BAGS LIKE THIS BRYCE CHARACTER WHO'D ROB YOUR MEDALS, HUH? NO, MY WORK HABITS WERE MORE RIGOROUS, YES. ANYTHING KEEPING YOU FROM GETTING RIGOROUS AGAIN? ONLY A DETERIORATING PHYSICAL CONDITION, PLUS THE GENERAL ROUT OF MY FACULTIES, AND A PERVASIVE SENSE OF DESPAIR. IN OTHER WORDS, UH, YOU'RE GETTING OLD. OH. WELL, I SUPPOSE IT DOESN'T MAKE ME UNIQUE. HEY, TAKE A SHOT, HUH? I'LL BET YOU CAN STILL DO IT. WELL, I GET MY OSCAR BACK AND A LECTURE ON FREE WILL. THAT'S WHY THIS IS A GREAT POLICE DEPARTMENT. [ CHUCKLES ] THANKS FOR THE BOOK. HEY, JOHN. HEY. YOU STILL ELIGIBLE FOR CONVERSATION? YEAH, SURE. I'M INVOLVED WITH THAT UNIFORM, LICALSI. WHOA, THERE'S A BOLT FROM THE BLUE. [ CHUCKLES ] AND, UH, ANYWAY, SHE'S INVOLVED IN THIS KIND OF COMPLICATED SITUATION‐‐ I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO THE DETAILS ABOUT IT NOW, BUT, I'M WORRIED ABOUT HER, AND SHE WON'T LET ME HELP HER WITH IT. SO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT SURE. I MEAN... I'D STEP IN, RIGHT? AND DO WHAT? I DON'T KNOW THAT EITHER. SO, YOU DEFINITELY GOT A WELL‐THOUGHT‐OUT PLAN, SHE JUST WON'T LET YOU PUT IT IN MOTION, HUH? YEAH. LOOK, UH... MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT, HUH, NOT LETTING YOU STEP IN? SHE IS SO FAR OVER HER HEAD, OF COURSE, THAT'S MY OPINION. BUT, THIS IS HARD FOR ME, MAN. YOU WANNA TAKE THE WEIGHT FOR HER? YEAH. [ DEEP SIGH ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU, JOHN. WHEN I WAS DRINKIN' AND MY OLD LADY WOULDN'T COOPERATE, MY ANGLE WAS I'D SMACK HER AROUND A LITTLE. PROBABLY THAT WAS THE WRONG APPROACH. PROBABLY. ‐ YOU READY? ‐ YEAH. GOOD JOB TODAY, JOHN. HEY, THANKS, LIEUTENANT. LIEUTENANT, THAT WASN'T ME WHO POPPED THE MAID FROM THE STOP‐AND‐FRISK FILES. THAT WAS MARTINEZ. HE'S GOING TO BE A GOOD COP, EH? YEAH. GOOD NIGHT. [ SIGHS ] [ CHUCKLES, SIGHS ] YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH, GO AHEAD. I'M FINE. HEY, THANKS, MAN. YOU GOT IT. I'LL SEE YOU, JOHN. YEAH. GOOD NIGHT. HEY, THANKS FOR THE HELP TODAY. YEAH, I'M GLAD IT WORKED OUT. GOOD NIGHT. HEY, LAURIE. [ CLEARS THROAT ] WAS IT, UH, WAS IT THE JOB OR NOT GIVIN' YOU ENOUGH ROOM THAT BROKE US UP? I DON'T KNOW. I DO KNOW THAT WHAT MADE YOU GOOD AT YOUR JOB... ALSO MADE IT HARD TO BE WITH YOU WHEN YOU WERE HOME. WHICH WASN'T THAT MUCH, RIGHT? WHICH WASN'T THAT MUCH. WHY DO YOU ASK? I WAS, UH, I WAS JUST WONDERING. TRY GIVING HER ROOM. GOOD NIGHT. YEAH. [ PEOPLE CHATTERING ] HOW'S YOUR FOOD? GOOD. YOU TRY THE SLAW? YOU GETTIN' YOUR JOLLIES OUT OF THIS, LIEUTENANT, HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU THINK I'M A RACIST. YOU'RE RUBBIN' MY NOSE IN IT HERE, A LITTLE BIT? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, LIEUTENANT. I'M ENTITLED TO MY FEELINGS AND MY OPINION. SO LONG AS I DO MY JOB THE RIGHT WAY. NOW, THAT INVESTIGATION ON THAT HOME INVASION WENT BY THE NUMBERS. I HAD A DESCRIPTION, FOUR BLACK MEN. ANDY‐‐ I QUESTIONED THE GIRL, DID SHE HAVE ANY BLACK ACQUAINTANCES? BECAUSE THAT WAS MY SUSPECT PROFILE. I GAVE THAT FUTREL GUY ZERO NOISE TILL HE GOT IN MY FACE. ANDY, I THINK YOU HANDLED THE INVESTIGATION PROPERLY. SO, WHAT AM I DOING HERE? I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ENJOY A MEAL. [ SPUTTERS ] YEAH, SURE. WHAT, YOU'RE NOT ENJOYING IT? YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. FOOD'S OKAY? YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. NOT EXACTLY WHAT I EAT. WELL, IT'S NOT WHAT I USUALLY EAT, EITHER. SOMETIMES, IT TASTES GOOD. YEAH, IT'S OKAY, HUH? SO WHY AREN'T YOU ENJOYING YOURSELF? LIEUTENANT, LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU GET DONE BUSTING MY BALLS. IS IT THE ATMOSPHERE, ANDY? OH, THAT'S POSSIBLE. SOMETHING ABOUT ME BEING THE ONLY WHITE GUY HERE. NOW, WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM? IS IT BECAUSE YOU FEEL THIS ISN'T YOUR PLACE? AND MAYBE SOME OF THESE PEOPLE THINK SO TOO? MAYBE A FEW OF 'EM JUST DON'T LIKE YOU. WHAT'S YOUR POINT, LIEUTENANT? YOU'RE BEING SERVED AREN'T YOU, ANDY? THEY COOKED THOSE RIBS FOR YOU. MAYBE THEY WANTED TO SPIT IN YOUR PLATE, BUT THEY DIDN'T. THEY SERVED YOUR WHITE ASS, JUST LIKE THEY WOULD ANYONE ELSE WHO CAME IN HERE. EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THEM HATE YOUR GUTS. SO, WHY WOULD YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE? YOU GOT YOUR MEAL. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHAT THEY'RE THINKING? THAT THEY DON'T LIKE YOU? HEY, THAT'S JUST AN OPINION. WHY SHOULD THAT BOTHER YOU? THEY'RE STILL DOING THEIR JOBS. NOW, WHAT IF THEY HAD GUNS AND BADGES? MY TREAT. EAT.
