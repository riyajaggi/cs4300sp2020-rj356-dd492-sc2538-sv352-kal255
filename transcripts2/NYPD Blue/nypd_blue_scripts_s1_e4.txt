 THIS IS GONNA TAKE SOME TIME, ANDY. COME ON, JOHN. PLEASE, I UNDERSTAND MY SITUATION. I SPENT A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BEING SAUCED. I NEED TO WIN BACK MY COLLEAGUES' TRUST. I'VE GOT TO EXHIBIT A CONTINUOUS POSITIVE APPROACH, EVEN WITH THIS DIM BULB HERE. SIPOWICZ, KELLY, ROBBERY, DOUBLE HOMICIDE. LIQUOR STORE OVER ON JAMES STREET. YOU GUYS WANNA GIVE ME A HAND ? ‐ YEAH, SURE. GIMME. ‐ OUR PLEASURE. UH, HERE'S THE ADDRESS. I'LL SEE YOU OVER THERE. THAT WAS POSITIVE, WASN'T IT? "OUR PLEASURE." FAIR. WHAT SHOULD I HAVE SAID? "OUR PLEASURE, ROOTY‐TOOT‐TOOT"? [ MEN CHATTERING ] CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE, DETECTIVE? YEAH. I'LL, UH, I'LL SEE YOU OUTSIDE, ALL RIGHT? YEAH, SURE. [ SIPOWICZ ] CATCH YOU LATER, TED. DID YOU GO TO YOUR DAD'S SERVICE? YEAH, I JUST GOT BACK. HOW'D YOUR MOTHER HOLD UP? OKAY. YEAH. I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR ME THE OTHER NIGHT. AW, IT'S ALL RIGHT. JOHN, I DON'T WANT IT TO BE OVER FOR US. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO TALK ABOUT IT. IT'S NOT LIKE YOU LET ME PICK MY SPOTS. OKAY. I ADMIT I HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU, BUT IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT FOR US. I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THAT. WE CAN MAKE IT WORK OUT. I GOTTA GO, ALL RIGHT? [ SIREN WAILING ] I'D JUST WALKED INTO THE STORE BEHIND THESE OTHER TWO GUYS. AND THIS GUY, HE COMES OUT FROM THE BACK ROOM WITH A GUN. HE MADE US ALL COME OVER TO THIS AISLE HERE AND LIE ON OUR STOMACHS. DID YOU GET A LOOK AT HIM? YEAH, PRETTY GOOD. HE WAS A WHITE GUY, TALL, ABOUT 50 YEARS OLD. HE HAD ON LIKE A BLACK TRENCH COAT, DOWN BELOW HIS KNEES. HE WAS LIKE SIX‐THREE, SIX‐FOUR. GOOD SIZED. ANY MARKS YOU NOTICED ON HIS FACE OR HANDS? ANY FACIAL HAIRS? YEAH, HE HAD A MUSTACHE, AND HE SMELLED LIKE HE'D BEEN DRINKING. HE CAME AND STOOD OVER US, AND THAT'S WHEN I HEARD THE CLICK... FROM THE GUN OVER MY HEAD. KELLY. THANK GOD HE MUST'VE USED UP ALL THE BULLETS‐‐ WHITE, 45 OR SO. AROUND SIX FEET TALL? ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THESE PEOPLE OVER TO THE PRECINCT. HAVE THEM TAKE A LOOK AT SOME PICTURES. MY GUY MAKES THE PERP ABOUT SIX‐THREE OR FOUR, 50 YEARS OLD, A MUSTACHE. LET'S GET 'EM OVER TO THE PRECINCT. HERE'S LICENSES FROM THE CARS PARKED OUTSIDE. OKAY. HEY, WALKER, WE DON'T HAVE TO HOLD HANDS, BUT WOULD YOU MIND... NOT TALKING TO ME LIKE I'M TIMMY, THE LAUNDRY BOY? YOU GIVE ME THE LICENSE NUMBERS FOR THE CANVASS. I SAID OKAY. ALL RIGHT. OKAY, FINE. IT'S MY MISTAKE. ALL RIGHT? YOU GOT A MINUTE, KELLY? LOOK, THIS IS NOTICE. I'M NOT TAKING ANY CRAP FROM YOUR FAT FRIEND. ‐ GIVE HIM A SQUARE SHOT. ‐ I'LL GIVE HIM THE SHOT HE EARNS. BUT I'M TELLING YOU, IF THAT DRUNK SCREWS UP MY CASE‐‐ YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION. HE HASN'T HAD A DRINK IN OVER TWO MONTHS. SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR ATTITUDE AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS? IS THIS SOMETHING THE WHOLE CLASS CAN APPRECIATE? WE'RE DONE. FOLKS, LET'S TAKE A RIDE OVER TO THE PRECINCT HOUSE, TRY AND MAKE A PHOTO I. D. [ SIREN WAILING ] HEY, DETECTIVE. HEY. [ MAN ] SEE ME ON YOUR WAY OUT. DON'T STOP TILL YOU DIE. OKAY, WE'LL TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS AND SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES. SEE IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY ANYONE. YEAH, ALL RIGHT. MRS. WAGNER. WHAT'S HAPPENING? MY HUSBAND TOLD ME YOU WON'T BE WORKING FOR US ANYMORE. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. UH... HOW'S THE EYE? IT'S FINE. PLEASE DON'T QUIT, MR. KELLY. MRS. WAGNER, YOU DON'T NEED A BODYGUARD FOR WHEN YOU GO OUT IN PUBLIC. YOUR PROBLEM IS A DOMESTIC SITUATION. MY ADVICE IS IF YOUR HUSBAND HITS YOU AGAIN, JUST FILE A CRIMINAL COMPLAINT OR MOVE OUT ON HIM. WHAT YOU SHOULDN'T DO IS STAY IN THAT BIG APARTMENT AND TAKE IT... OR TALK THE WAY YOU WERE THE OTHER NIGHT, WHICH SOUNDED LIKE YOU WERE SOLICITING ME TO COMMIT A CRIME. WHEN I SAID THAT I WISHED SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM, I WAS UPSET. I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BY IT. OKAY, MAYBE I MISUNDERSTOOD. BUT, MRS. WAGNER, A LOT OF WOMEN THAT HAVE HUSBANDS LIKE YOURS... CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP THEMSELVES. YOU CAN. YOU CAN MAKE A CHOICE. DO IT. YOU'RE INDULGING A PREJUDICE, MR. KELLY. AFFLUENCE DOESN'T ALWAYS PURCHASE OPPORTUNITY. TAKE A LOOK AT THESE. HEY, SIPOWICZ. WHAT? MY WITNESS JUST I. D.'D THIS GUY. HE'S GOT TWO PRIORS FOR ARMED ROBBERY. SHOW HIM TO YOUR PEOPLE. HEY, WAIT. THIS GUY'S FIVE‐NINE. SO WHAT? OUR STATEMENTS MADE THE PERP AT SIX‐THREE OR FOUR. MINE SAID AROUND SIX. SIPOWICZ, PEOPLE LOOK TALLER WHEN YOU'RE LYING ON THE GROUND. SHOW 'EM THE PHOTOGRAPH. NEW FACES. NO. [ SIPOWICZ ] ALL RIGHT, TAKE YOUR TIME. LOOK AT THESE CAREFULLY. THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FAST. WE GOT PLENTY MORE PICTURES. NO, I DON'T RECOGNIZE ANYBODY. NO! KELLY. I GOT A POSITIVE I.D. FROM ONE WITNESS. THE GUY'S NAME IS COLEMAN. HE'S GOT THE RIGHT PRIORS. I WANT TO PICK HIM UP. SIPOWICZ THINKS HE MAY BE TOO SHORT. NO, NO, NO, NO. LET'S PICK HIM UP. MAYBE HE WAS WEARIN' LIFTS. [ HORN HONKING ] YEAH, BENSONHURST, JOHN. IT'S A LIKELY LOCALE, HUH? GUY LIVES HERE, WANTS TO ROB A LIQUOR STORE IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN. ALL HE'S GOTTA DO IS MAKE LIKE, WHAT, NINE, TEN SUBWAY TRANSFERS? MAYBE HE HAD BUSINESS DOWNTOWN AND CAME BACK AND DID THE STORE THEN. YEAH, RIGHT. MAYBE HIS DOCTOR'S DOWN ON JAMES STREET, HUH? THE ONE THAT GIVES HIM HIS HORMONE INJECTIONS THAT PUMP HIM UP TO SIX‐THREE... WHEN HE'S ABOUT TO PULL A JOB... AND THEN SHRINK HIM DOWN TO HIS NORMAL FIVE‐NINE RIGHT AFTERWARD, HUH? [ SIGHS ] SO WHAT'S GOIN' ON WITH YOU AND THAT GIRL? WHICH GIRL? THE ONE WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKIN' ABOUT. LICALSI. NOTHING'S GOIN' ON. HEY, HEY, YOU'RE A DIVORCED MAN, JOHN. IT'S A HEALTHY URGE. IF SHE WORKED AT A TOPLESS BAR, I'D TAKE A SHOT AT HER MYSELF. NOTHING IS GOING ON, AND HERE'S THE GUY, ANDY. ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE THE BASTARD. IF HE DIDN'T DO THE LIQUOR STORE, MAYBE HE DID SOMETHING ELSE. OH, LOOK AT THIS, JOHN. WHERE'S HIS MUSTACHE, HUH? OUR WITNESS SAID HE HAD A MUSTACHE. PEOPLE SHAVE. POLICE OFFICERS. ARE YOU HOWARD COLEMAN? YEAH. WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR ACTIVITIES THIS MORNING. I DIDN'T HAVE ANY ACTIVITIES. I WENT TO THE DRUGSTORE. THAT'S THE FIRST I WENT OUT. YOU WERE SEEN ON JAMES STREET THIS MORNING IN MANHATTAN. I WASN'T THERE. YOU GET OFF MY PROPERTY. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE YOU IN FOR QUESTIONING. YOU BETTER HAVE A WARRANT... OR GET AWAY FROM ME! DON'T MAKE THIS ANY TOUGHER THAN IT HAS TO BE. DADDY, WHAT'S THE MATTER? GO BACK INSIDE. TAKE THIS. IT'S YOUR MEDICINE. ‐ COME ON! ‐ HEY! HEY, HEY! DADDY! TAKE IT EASY. ‐ STOP IT! YOU'RE HURTING HIM! ‐ [ SIPOWICZ ] NO, NO. NOBODY'S GONNA GET HURT. ‐ NOW YOU'RE UNDER ARREST! ‐ [ SIPOWICZ ] TAKE IT EASY. DADDY? DADDY! IT'S ALL RIGHT. ‐ SURE ACTS INNOCENT, DOESN'T HE, SIPOWICZ? ‐ [ FRUSTRATED SCREAM ] YOU DIDN'T ROB ANY LIQUOR STORE, RIGHT, COLEMAN? YOU ALWAYS CARRY 850 BUCKS AROUND IN YOUR POCKET. WHERE'D YOU GET THAT MONEY? I BET A HORSE YESTERDAY. ‐ WHICH HORSE? WHERE? WHAT RACE WAS HE IN? ‐ SOME HORSE AT AQUEDUCT. I DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME. NO ONE'S SAYING YOU WENT IN THAT STORE TO DO MURDER. NOW, WHAT HAPPENED THERE? TAKING THE PLACE OFF, AND SOMEONE TRIED TO GET VIOLENT WITH YOU? ‐ WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN? ‐ DETECTIVE WALKER. DETECTIVE WALKER, I WAS NEVER NEAR ANY LIQUOR STORE ON JAMES STREET TODAY. I WASN'T IN MANHATTAN, SO WHY DON'T YOU KISS MY ASS? WHAT IF I GIVE YOU A BROKEN JAW, HUH? YOU BETTER MAKE SURE THESE GUYS ARE HOLDING ME DOWN. HERE WE GO. THAT'S IT, WALKER. COME ON. ‐ THERE YOU GO. ‐ HEY, HOWARD, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR DAUGHTER? ‐ WHAT DO YOU MEAN? ‐ YOU TOLD HER TO TAKE SOME MEDICINE. IT'S FOR HER BREATHING. SHE'S GOT ASTHMA. YEAH? I HAD A KID HAD THAT. SO WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO DO, MAKE ME LOVE YOU? I WAS HOPING YOU'D GET SOME DEEP, WARM FEELINGS FOR ME, YEAH. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET BACK TO THE MONEY. YOUR EX‐WIFE'S HERE TO SEE YOU, DETECTIVE. UH, THANKS. SURE. HI. I JUST QUIT MY JOB. WHAT BROUGHT THAT ABOUT? THOSE CREEPS HAD ME IN FOR A "CARDS ON THE TABLE" CONVERSATION. "LAURA, WE NEED YOU TO BE MORE FORTHCOMING ABOUT YOUR PREVIOUS WORK FOR THE CITY. "WE NEED TO KNOW THEIR APPROACH ON OUR CLIENTS' VARIANCE APPLICATIONS. HOW DO THEY STAND ON PICHEON AND DEAN?" "EXCUSE ME," I ASK. "I GUESS THAT STUFF WHEN I CAME HERE, HOW IT WAS ME YOU WERE INTERESTED IN... AND NOT MY CONTACTS FROM MY PREVIOUS EMPLOYMENT, ALL THAT WAS A CROCK?" "LET'S BE ADULTS, LAURA." SO I TOLD THEM THEY COULD STICK THEIR JOB UP THEIR ASS. JUST YOUR WAY OF GIVING NOTICE, HUH? [ CHUCKLES ] YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY, "I TOLD YOU SO"? NO. NOT THE TYPE. ‐ YOU GOT PLANS FOR DINNER? ‐ YOU BUYING? PICK YOU UP IN A COUPLE OF HOURS. I'M GONNA BE TRUTHFUL WITH YOU, MR. SCHAUFFNER. THE WAY THESE LINEUPS WORK, YOU'RE NOT GONNA HELP ME ANY... IF YOU SAY, "THAT COULD BE HIM" OR "MAYBE THAT'S THE GUY." YOU GOTTA SAY, "THAT'S HIM. I RECOGNIZE HIM. THAT'S THE GUY." YOU FOLLOW? I UNDERSTAND. 'COURSE, I'M SAYING, IF YOU RECOGNIZE HIM. DON'T SAY YOU RECOGNIZE HIM IF YOU DON'T. RIGHT. NOW YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED, SO WE CAN GET STARTED HERE. KELLY. IT'S LINEUP TIME. WALKER JUST FINISHED TOUCHING UP THE BULL'S‐EYE ON COLEMAN'S FOREHEAD. ALL RIGHT, COME ON. HERE. TAKE A LOOK. [ WALKER ] TAKE YOUR TIME. I SEE HIM. WHICH ONE? NUMBER THREE. ARE YOU SURE? YEAH, I'M SURE. THAT'S THE GUY. I RECOGNIZE HIM. [ WALKER ] I LIKE THE GUY REAL GOOD, LIEUTENANT. HE DID TWO BITS FOR ARMED ROBBERY. WE GOT A POSITIVE‐WITNESS I. D. PLUS, WHEN WE PINCHED HIM, HE HAD 850 BUCKS IN HIS POCKET... HE COULDN'T SATISFACTORILY EXPLAIN. WHAT DO YOU THINK? LOOKS GOOD SO FAR. WE'LL WANT TO SEE IF CRIME SCENE LIFTS PRINTS AND SO FORTH FROM THAT LIQUOR STORE, BUT, YOU KNOW, LIKE HE SAYS. WORK IT UP, GIVE IT TO THE D. A. [ PHONE RINGS ] LIEUTENANT FANCY. YEAH, I GOT A COPY OF THE REPORT. YEAH, I READ IT. WELL, IN THE FUTURE, YOU CAN ASSUME‐‐ THANKS FOR THE HELP. YEAH. I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE SO IRRITABLE ALL DAY. NO PROBLEM. YOU SON OF A BITCH! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? LET'S GET YOU TO THE COURT. I GOTTA CALL MY DAUGHTER, LET HER KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. CALL HER FROM THE TOMBS. I'M TELLIN' YOU, JOHN, HE DIDN'T DO IT. LET IT UNWIND, ANDY. WE'LL STAY ON IT. YEAH, MEANWHILE, COLEMAN EATS PRISON FOOD. 4B. HOW'S IT GOIN'? FINE, DETECTIVE. DO YOU HAVE A, UH, A MOMENT FOR ME? YEAH, COME ON. SEVERAL MATTERS. FIRST, NEEDLESS TO SAY, OUR TENANTS' READINESS GROUP... IS EAGER TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS TOMORROW EVENING... BOTH ON THE BUILDING SECURITY AND PERSONAL SAFETY MEASURES. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO BY WAY OF ADVANCE PREPARATION? WILL YOU HAVE VISUAL AIDS AND THE LIKE I CAN HELP TO SET UP? NO, NO VISUAL AIDS. I'LL JUST BE TALKIN' FOR A WHILE. FINE. I'VE ARRANGED FOR SOME REFRESHMENTS AND THE LIKE. THE OTHER THING, DETECTIVE, CONCERNS... THE UPCOMING FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF MY COLLEGE GRADUATION. THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE HAS ASKED EACH MEMBER OF MY CLASS... TO WRITE A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHAT'S BECOME OF THEM IN THE INTERVENING YEARS. AND I FIND, SURPRISINGLY, LOOKING BACK, YOU KNOW, LEAVING HOME AND MOVING TO NEW YORK AND SO FORTH, THAT THIS INCIDENT OF GETTING ROBBED AND BEATEN UP... AND THEN DEALING WITH THE MAN SUBSEQUENTLY, IN A WAY TAKING BACK MY CITIZENSHIP, THAT WHOLE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN VERY FORMATIVE FOR ME. I WONDER IF I CAN ACCESS YOUR POLICE REPORTS SO I COULD WRITE THE EXPERIENCE UP. ‐ NO. ‐ NO? I COULDN'T RELEASE THEM INFORMALLY TO YOU. YOU'D HAVE TO FILL OUT AN APPLICATION. THAT WOULD TAKE A‐‐ I REALLY FEEL THAT THOSE REPORTS WOULD BE USEFUL TO ME. 4B, WHY DON'T YOU‐‐ WHY DON'T YOU CONCENTRATE ON YOUR CAREER HIGHLIGHTS, YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS? SEND THAT IN TO YOUR YEARBOOK. WHY WRITE ABOUT A PUNK WHO TRIED TO ROB YA? BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME. I THINK YOU'RE GETTING TIED UP IN KNOTS ABOUT THIS. I‐I DISAGREE, DETECTIVE. I FEEL AS THOUGH THE SCALES HAVE FALLEN AWAY FROM MY EYES. I FINALLY UNDERSTAND THIS CITY, YOU KNOW. WHAT IT TAKES TO DEAL WITH IT, HOW TO MEET IT ON ITS OWN TERMS, WHAT IT TAKES TO HELP OTHERS, HOW OTHERS, THEY‐‐ THEY NEED TO BE HELPED. THIS IS NOT HIGH NOON, 4B. I HAVE TO SAY THAT YOUR REACTION TYPIFIES... WHAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN CAN EXPECT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT. A‐A KNOWING, HAUGHTY INDIFFERENCE. I GOTTA GO, 4B. ME AND MY HAUGHTY INDIFFERENCE WILL BE AT THAT TENANT MEETING TOMORROW NIGHT. [ RINGS ] LAURIE. LAURIE? [ WATER RUNNING ] LAURIE! IT'S ME, JOHN. HI, JOHNNY. THERE'S A BEER IN THE FRIDGE. OKAY. I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE. CAN I GET YOU A TOWEL? I CAN GET ONE. THANKS. WELL, I JUST RAN OUT OF EXCUSES FOR COMIN' IN THERE. SINCE WHEN DID YOU EVER NEED AN EXCUSE? I COULD COOK FOR US HERE. I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA GO OUT. OKAY. YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY? NO, THAT'S FINE. I THINK I CAN GET WORK WITH SOMEONE I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH. JIMMY CRAIG. JAMES CRAIG WHO PROSECUTES NARCOTICS? YEAH, IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. YOU'RE KIDDING ME. [ CHUCKLES ] NO, I'M NOT KIDDING. ‐ ARE YOU NUTS, LAURIE? THOSE PEOPLE ARE SCUMBAGS. ‐ YOU DON'T KNOW JIMMY CRAIG. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT JIMMY CRAIG. I'M TALKIN' ABOUT THE PEOPLE YOU PROSECUTE. I DIDN'T REALIZE I NEEDED A NOTE FROM YOU. HEY, I AM NOT OUT IN THE STREETS SO YOU CAN WIND UP DEALIN' WITH CREEPS LIKE THAT. IT'S A JOB, JOHN. I'M NOT MUD WRESTLING WITH THEM. LOOK, I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I'M GOING TO DO IT. DON'T LOAD ME DOWN WITH TEENAGE FANTASIES ABOUT MAKING THE WORLD SAFE WHILE I STAY HOME AND BAKE. IT MADE ME CRAZY WHILE WE WERE MARRIED. AND THAT WAS JUST SEX? ‐ YOU GOT IN THE SHOWER WITH ME. ‐ DID YOU PUSH ME AWAY? [ SIGHS ] YOU'RE RIGHT. THIS HAS TO STOP. I JUST KEPT HOPING THAT WE COULD REMAIN CLOSE. I MEAN, WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN EACH OTHER'S BEST FRIEND. I WANNA STAY CLOSE. BUT WE CAN'T. IT'S TOO COMPLICATED. WE CAN'T STAY INSIDE THE LINES. [ BEEPING ] PERFECT. [ BEEPING CONTINUES ] [ HORN HONKS ] YEAH, THIS IS DETECTIVE JOHN KELLY OF THE 15TH SQUAD. I HAVE A SHOOTING VICTIM, D. O. A., AT 626 PARK AVENUE, 12TH FLOOR. NO, NO APARTMENT NUMBER. THE WHOLE FLOOR'S AN APARTMENT. YOU WANT SOME WATER OR SOMETHING TO DRINK? NO. YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED? HE WAS DRUNK. UH, WE ARGUED. IN FACT, WE ARGUED ABOUT YOU. HE HIT ME, I WENT INTO THE BEDROOM AND GOT THE GUN. I CAME BACK AND TOLD HIM TO LEAVE. HE HIT ME AGAIN, AND I SHOT HIM. WHERE'D YOU GET THE GUN? HE GAVE IT TO ME A YEAR AGO WHEN ANOTHER APARTMENT IN THE BUILDING WAS ROBBED. OKAY, SO YOU WENT INTO THE BEDROOM AND GOT IT... AFTER HE STRUCK YOU THE FIRST TIME? YES. OKAY, DID YOU TELL HIM YOU WERE GONNA DO THIS? NO, HE WENT TO GET A DRINK, AND THAT'S WHEN I GOT THE GUN. I WANT YOU TO TELL ME AGAIN WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF THE BEDROOM. I TOLD HIM TO LEAVE, AND HE HIT ME. WHILE YOU HELD THE GUN ON HIM. YES. WHERE DID HE HIT YOU? IN THE FACE. HOW MANY TIMES? TWO, THREE? SEVERAL TIMES. THREE. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? I POINTED THE GUN AND SHOT HIM. DID HE GRAB AT IT WHILE YOU TRAINED IT ON HIM? NO, I TOOK A STEP BACK AND THEN I FIRED. OKAY. ARE YOU SURE HE HIT YOU, MRS. WAGNER? [ EXHALES ] YES. I'M SURPRISED THAT YOU WOULD ASK ME THAT QUESTION. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD SAY ANY MORE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? NO NEW MARKS OR BRUISES ON YOU. THE PLACE IS CLEAN, NO SIGN OF A STRUGGLE. NO CONTACT WOUNDS, POWDER RESIDUE ON YOUR HUSBAND'S BODY... ‐ THE WAY THERE WOULD BE IF HE WAS SHOT AT CLOSE RANGE. ‐ I'M TELLING THE TRUTH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE TONIGHT, BUT YOU'RE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH, SO DON'T SAY ANY MORE. WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME LIKE THIS? BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO TAKE YOU IN, SO SHUT UP UNTIL YOU SPEAK TO YOUR ATTORNEY. [ SIREN WAILING ] [ SIREN WAILS ] HOW'S IT GOIN', LIEUTENANT? GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING, LIEUTENANT. GOOD MORNING, SERGEANT. HOW YA DOIN', SARGE? HEY, DETECTIVE? WE'RE THROWIN' A RACKET FOR HANSON TOMORROW NIGHT. THE KID'S GETTIN' MARRIED. ALL RIGHT, HERE. WHO CAUGHT THAT LIQUOR STORE HOMICIDE YOU WERE OUT ON YESTERDAY, DETECTIVE? WALKER. UH, LET ME SEE. SOMETHING COME IN? YEAH. AND THAT'S THE GUY HE COLLARED'S DAUGHTER. [ PHONE RINGING ] YOU ARRESTED MY FATHER YESTERDAY. THE DETECTIVE HANDLING THAT SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE. MY FATHER DIDN'T ROB THAT LIQUOR STORE. HE DIDN'T SHOOT THOSE PEOPLE. YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? YES. I CAN PROVE IT. UM, HERE. LET'S GO IN THERE. [ PHONE RINGS ] HE WAS AT HOME WHEN THAT ROBBERY HAPPENED. HE, UM‐‐ HE BOOKS NUMBERS. HE STAYS AT HOME TILL THE NUMBER COMES OUT. THE MONEY HELPS WITH MY MEDICAL BILLS. IT VIOLATES HIS PAROLE. ‐ THAT'S WHY HE HAD $850 WHEN WE ARRESTED HIM. ‐ YES. YOU WERE WITH HIM YESTERDAY, IN THE HOUSE THE WHOLE MORNING? NO, I WAS AT THE DOCTOR'S. I HAVE ASTHMA. BUT I KNOW HE WAS HOME. OKAY, THAT'S GONNA BE REAL HELPFUL. ARE YOU GOING TO LET HIM GO? WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA KEEP LOOKING INTO THINGS. WHY CAN'T YOU LET HIM GO? I TOLD YOU HE WAS HOME. YOU SEE, BEING AT THE DOCTOR, YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY VERIFY YOUR FATHER'S WHEREABOUTS. I'M BY MYSELF NOW IN THAT HOUSE. I'M ALONE THERE. WE GOT OTHER INFORMATION COMING IN. YOU KEEP A GOOD THOUGHT HOW THINGS ARE GONNA WORK OUT. COME ON. YOU GOT ANY PETS TO KEEP YOU COMPANY? NO. I'M ALLERGIC. UH... I'M UP LATE, SO... IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING, GIVE ME A CALL. [ SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE ] ANYTHING COME IN ABOUT THAT LIQUOR STORE CASE? YEAH. WE GOT AN ANONYMOUS TIP DURING THE NIGHT. OF COURSE, YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU, SIPOWICZ? SARGE TOLD ME YOU LOOKED AT MY MESSAGES. YEAH, I GLANCED AT IT. SOMEONE CALLS IN, HEARD SOMEBODY TALKIN' ABOUT PULLIN' THAT JOB, WE SHOULD CHECK IT OUT. AN ANONYMOUS TIP FROM A GIN MILL PAY PHONE ABOUT AN OVERHEARD CONVERSATION. SOUNDS VERY HOT. ALL I'M SAYING IS, WE SHOULD CHECK THAT BAR OUT, SEE IF ANYBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THAT PHONE CALL. LOOK, SIPOWICZ, WHAT DID YOU DO? TAKE A VOW TO MAKE MY LIFE MISERABLE? WE POPPED THE GUY WHO DID THIS. YOU DON'T COME, I'M GOIN' OVER THERE BY MYSELF. MAYBE YOU'D LIKE THAT. YOU COULD TOSS BACK A FEW SHOTS. WHO DRIVES? I THINK MRS. WAGNER'S PATIENCE AND COURTESY HAVE BEEN ABUSED LONG ENOUGH. I'M SORRY TO DETAIN YOU FOR SO LONG. WE HAD TO COLLECT THE CRIME SCENE REPORT... AND MEDICAL EXAMINER'S FINDINGS. NEITHER ONE SUPPORT MRS. WAGNER'S ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT. IN ADDITION, DETECTIVE KELLY STATES YOU MADE AN INCRIMINATING SOLICITATION... TO HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE. UNLESS WE GET MORE INFORMATION, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ARRAIGN THIS AS A MURDER. GENTLEMEN, I'M NOT GONNA TRY THIS CASE IN A DETECTIVES' SQUAD ROOM. LET ME ASSURE YOU, THE ABSENCE OF POWDER RESIDUE... DOES NOT PRECLUDE A CLOSE‐RANGE WEAPON DISCHARGE. NOR DOES AN APARTMENT FAILING TO SHOW SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE MEAN A STRUGGLE DIDN'T HAPPEN. AS FAR AS MRS. WAGNER'S OSTENSIBLY SOLICITING DETECTIVE KELLY... TO KILL HER HUSBAND, IT WOULD TAKE ME FIVE MINUTES TO CONVINCE A JURY... THAT WAS A CONFUSED AND ULTIMATELY INNOCUOUS REMARK. SO INNOCUOUS, IN FACT, THAT AT THE TIME, THE DETECTIVE CHOOSE NOT TO REPORT IT. MRS. WAGNER. TALK TO ME, DETECTIVE KELLY, AND ONLY TO ME. ON WHICH SUBJECT, YOU SHOULD ALSO UNDERSTAND... THAT SINCE YOU FAILED TO GIVE MRS. WAGNER HER MIRANDA WARNING, NOTHING SHE SAID TO YOU IN HER APARTMENT LAST NIGHT... IS GOING TO BE ADMISSIBLE IN COURT. SHE DIDN'T NEED MIRANDA. WHEN SHE TALKED TO ME, SHE WASN'T A SUSPECT. BUT WHEN SHE BECAME A SUSPECT, I ADVISED HER TO KEEP QUIET UNTIL SHE HAD COUNSEL. THAT'S A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WE'LL TAKE UP BEFORE A JUDGE. AND YOU'RE JUST DYING TO GET TO BAT ON THIS ONE, AREN'T YOU? ‐ PUMP UP THAT BILL. ‐ WHAT DO YOU THINK I SHOULD DO, DETECTIVE? HE'S NOT YOUR LAWYER, MRS. WAGNER. MRS. WAGNER, I CAN IMAGINE SOMETHING LIKE THIS‐‐ YOUR HUSBAND CAME HOME. HE WAS LOADED. YOU WERE AFRAID YOU WERE GONNA GET ANOTHER BEATING, SO YOU WENT INTO THE BEDROOM, GOT THE GUN. WHEN YOU CAME OUT, YOU ASKED HIM TO LEAVE, AND HE WOULDN'T. MAYBE HE STARTED TOWARD YOU, AND SO YOU SHOT HIM FROM ACROSS THE ROOM. IT'S NOT‐‐ DON'T ANSWER. SHE'S NOT GONNA ANSWER YOU, DETECTIVE. IF THAT'S THE WAY IT HAPPENED, YOU BETTER SAY SO NOW... BECAUSE THE D. A. CAN WRITE THIS UP AS MANSLAUGHTER. A LEGAL AID ATTORNEY CAN GET YOU EASY TIME, MAYBE EVEN OFF, LET ALONE A SEVEN‐FIGURE ACE LIKE THIS. YOU'RE WASTING EVERYBODY'S TIME. MRS. WAGNER, DON'T UNDERESTIMATE US. IF YOU LIE, WE WILL NAIL YOU. TELL THE TRUTH, AND I WILL TESTIFY FOR YOU. I WILL VERIFY THAT YOU'D BEEN BEATEN UP THE NIGHT BEFORE AND YOU WERE EMOTIONALLY DISTRAUGHT. DETECTIVE‐‐ BUT THIS SMART SON OF A BITCH... WANTS YOU TO STICK TO YOUR STORY. THAT'S GONNA LAND YOU IN CENTRAL BOOKING AND RIKERS ISLAND WITH THE WHORES AND JUNKIES. NOT HIM, YOU. SO YOU MAKE THE DECISION. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S GONNA BE DOING THE TIME. LIEUTENANT, I WANT HIM OUT OF THIS ROOM SO I CAN CONSULT WITH MY CLIENT. HOW'S IT GOING, GUYS? WERE YOU WORKING HERE LAST NIGHT? I COME IN AROUND 11:30, PICK UP RECEIPTS. IS THIS YOUR PLACE? YEAH, NIGHT GUY COMES ON AROUND 7:00 IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO HIM. WE GOT INFORMATION A PHONE CALL WAS MADE FROM HERE LAST NIGHT, MAY HAVE A CONNECTION WITH A ROBBERY‐HOMICIDE WE'RE INVESTIGATING. SOMEBODY OVERHEARD A GUY TALKIN' ON THAT PAY PHONE... ‐ ABOUT ROBBIN' A LIQUOR STORE YESTERDAY. ‐ IS THAT RIGHT? NIGHT GUY SAY ANYTHING TO YOU? ‐ ANYBODY TALK TO HIM ABOUT OVERHEARING A CALL LIKE THAT? ‐ NO. ‐ WHERE'D YOU GET THIS INFORMATION? ‐ LOOK, I'LL ASK THE QUESTIONS. HEY, PAL, WERE YOU IN HERE LAST NIGHT? DON'T INVOLVE ME IN THIS. IS IT A CRIME TO HAVE A BEER AND READ THE PAPER? HEY, HEY, HEY. WE'RE ONLY ASKING YOU. DID YOU HEAR SOMEBODY SHOOTIN' OFF THEIR MOUTH ABOUT PULLIN' A JOB? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I MIND MY OWN BUSINESS. I DON'T INTERFERE. AND I EXPECT TO BE TREATED THAT WAY IN RETURN. OKAY, WELL, WE JUST RECEIVED THIS HOT TIP, AND, UH, WE'RE COVERING ALL OUR BASES. UNLESS YOU GOT ANY MORE QUESTIONS. WAIT HERE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT? WE'RE GONNA WAIT. THAT'S OUR GUY AT THE BAR. THAT SKELL BY THE PHONE? YOU REALLY ARE IN WARPED TERRITORY NOW, SIPOWICZ. YEAH, RIGHT. YOU GOT A SERIOUS CASE OF DICK‐BRAIN. AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT SKELL AT THE CORNER KNOWS SOMETHING, HUH? HE'S LOOKIN' FOR US. HE'S BEEN SITTIN' THERE WAITIN' FOR US TO COME IN. GODDAMN YOU. I'VE BEEN WAITING HERE‐‐ THERE HE IS. HEY. HEY, PAL. HEY, YO. HEY, PAL. COME ON. I WANNA ASK YOU A QUESTION. WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHAT HAVE I DONE? I JUST WANNA TALK TO YOU. JUST WANNA ASK A QUESTION. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? DWIGHT. THIS IS LIKE THE GESTAPO, LIKE A WORLD WAR II MOVIE IN GERMANY. YOU PHONED THAT TIP IN, DIDN'T YOU? YOU LEFT A MESSAGE, AND YOU'VE BEEN SITTING, WAITING FOR US TO COME IN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. LISTEN TO ME, DWIGHT! YOU MADE THAT CALL. I KNOW IT. MY PARTNER KNOWS IT. YOU KNOW IT. SO LET'S STOP KIDDING EACH OTHER, HUH? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, AND I DON'T WANNA‐‐ SETTLE DOWN. BOY, YOU'D THINK A PERSON WHO LIVES ALONE AND KEEPS TO HIMSELF... WOULDN'T GET INVOLVED IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS. YOU ARE INVOLVED, DWIGHT, BECAUSE YOU MADE THAT CALL. TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW, AND WE'LL FIGURE THE BEST WAY TO KEEP YOUR NAME OUT OF IT. COME ON! ‐ ALL I KNOW IS THAT I WISH HE WOULD MOVE OUT. ‐ WHO? MOVE OUT OF WHERE? FRANK ARCHER. OUT OF THE DELAWARE ARMS. ON 46TH? YEAH. YEAH, WHAT? COME ON. WHAT IF I TOLD YOU HE FIRED A GUN OFF IN HIS ROOM THE OTHER NIGHT? HE SHOT A BULLET INTO THE WALL. I SHARE THAT WALL. I HAVE ADULT‐ONSET DIABETES. HOW DO YOU THINK I FELT? ‐ WHAT DID HE SHOOT THE GUN OFF FOR, DWIGHT? ‐ WHY ASK ME? I'M THE ONE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO SEE IF HE WAS ALL RIGHT AFTER I HEARD THE GUNSHOT. "IT WORKS," HE SAYS, AS HE'S WALKING DOWN THE HALL WITH A GUN IN HIS HAND. DRUNK AS A SKUNK. HE'S THREE SHEETS TO THE WIND. THAT WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST? YEAH. THEN LAST NIGHT HE WALKS INTO THE SHAMROCK, BIG AS LIFE, BEING A BIG SHOT, TELLING SOME WOMAN ON THE PHONE HOW HE ROBBED A LIQUOR STORE... WEARING A FAKE MUSTACHE, AND HE JUST CAME INTO A LOT OF MONEY. HE‐‐ HE SAW ME. HE KNEW HE NEARLY PUT ME INTO CARDIAC FAILURE BLOWIN' OFF THAT GUN. DO YOU THINK THAT HE BOUGHT A ROUND FOR ME? HOW TALL IS THIS GUY, DWIGHT? SIX‐FOOT‐THREE. TILL JUST RECENTLY, I WAS A TENANT HERE IN THE BUILDING, BUT TONIGHT I'M GONNA BE SPEAKING TO YOU AS A POLICE OFFICER... ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO MAKE YOURSELVES... AND YOUR BUILDING MORE SAFE. ON THE TABLE, I'VE PUT SOME LITERATURE... WHICH TALKS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT LOCKS AND BOLTS WE THINK ARE MOST EFFECTIVE... AND SOME OF THE PRECAUTIONS YOU CAN TAKE WHILE ENTERING AND EXITING... THE COMMON AREAS OF THE BUILDING. ELEVATORS, HALLWAYS, STAIRS, THINGS LIKE THAT. IN TERMS OF THE UNPLEASANT REALITY OF ACTUALLY BEING ACCOSTED, MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT MR. GOLDSTEIN OF APARTMENT 4B... JUST RECENTLY CURTAILED THE MUGGING CAREER OF A PERPETRATOR... WHO HAD VICTIMIZED SOME OF THE TENANTS HERE IN THE BUILDING. MR. GOLDSTEIN HAPPENED TO HAVE A GUN ON HIM... WHILE HE WAS DOING HIS LAUNDRY, AND THE THIEF ATTEMPTED TO ROB HIM. AND HE USED IT. AND ON THAT OCCASION, IT WORKED FOR HIM. BUT I MUST TELL YOU THAT WE DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. OUR RECOMMENDATION IS, GIVE IT UP. WHATEVER THEY'RE LOOKING FOR‐‐ MONEY, JEWELRY‐‐ GIVE IT UP. CALL US, AND WE'LL DO OUR JOB. NOW, HAVING SAID THAT, HAVING GIVEN YOU THOSE WARNINGS, I WANT TO SAY DON'T LIVE AFRAID. DON'T HIDE. DON'T BE ANGRY. AND DON'T GO OUT AND LOOK FOR VENGEANCE ON THOSE PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE LAW. THOSE ARE JUST OTHER WAYS OF GIVING UP YOUR FREEDOM... THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD IF YOU WERE VICTIMIZED BY VIOLENCE. NOW, IT'S EASY FOR ME TO‐‐ EASY FOR ME TO STAND HERE... AND SAY THESE THINGS AND TELL YOU HOW TO LIVE YOUR LIVES, TELL YOU NOT TO REACT TO THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU. AND I WOULD NEVER PUT MYSELF UP AS AN EXPERT... ON HOW TO NOT HOLD ON TO THINGS. MY, UH, MY DAD... WAS SHOT DOWN ON THE STREETS, SO... I, UH, I TEND TO‐‐ TEND TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFUL. MAYBE, UH, A LITTLE BIT OVERPROTECTIVE... [ SIGHS ] TO THE POINT OF, UH, MAYBE CRAMPING ANOTHER PERSON'S STYLE. ANYWAY, UH, MY POINT IS... THAT, UH, THIS IS YOUR CITY. THIS IS YOUR CITY, NOT THE BAD GUYS'. THIS IS YOUR LIFE. SO BE FREE. LIVE IT AS FREE AS YOU CAN, AND, UH, WE'LL BE THERE FOR YOU. AND, UH, WE'LL TRY NOT TO GET IN YOUR WAY. OKAY? QUIT PUSHING ME AROUND. COME ON! I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. NAH, YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

I WANT IT ON THE RECORD THAT IT'S AGAINST ADVICE OF COUNSEL. [ DOOR CLOSES ] I DID NOT PLAN TO KILL MY HUSBAND. WE WERE EXTREMELY UNHAPPY TOGETHER. WE'D BEEN UNHAPPY FOR A LONG TIME. AND I'D‐‐ I'D OFTEN, I SUPPOSE‐‐ I ACTUALLY DID OFTEN WISH THAT HE WOULD DIE. I REMEMBER SEVEN TIMES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS... THAT HE BEAT ME WITH HIS FISTS VERY BADLY. AND I DID FREQUENTLY WISH THAT HE WERE DEAD... OR THAT THE RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE OVER. AND I DID SAY THAT I WISHED HE WERE DEAD... AND THAT IF I HAD COME HOME ONE NIGHT AND FOUND HIM DEAD, THAT I'D HAVE BEEN GLAD, RELIEVED. BUT IN NO WAY WAS I ASKING DETECTIVE KELLY... TO KILL HIM. DESCRIBE THE EVENTS OF THE OTHER NIGHT THAT LED TO YOUR HUSBAND'S DEATH. HE CAME HOME, AND I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BEAT ME BECAUSE OF THE TONE OF HIS VOICE... AND LOOK HE HAD IN HIS EYES. AND‐‐ AND I WAS AFRAID. THE SIDE OF MY‐‐ [ SNIFFS ] OF MY FACE AND EAR STILL ACHED... AND RANG FROM WHERE HE'D HIT ME THE OTHER NIGHT. I WENT INTO THE BEDROOM, GOT THE GUN AND TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD TO LEAVE. WAS IT IN YOUR MIND AT THAT POINT TO SHOOT HIM? NO, IT WAS NOT. I WANTED HIM TO LEAVE. I JUST WANTED HIM... TO LEAVE ME ALONE. JUST‐‐ JUST DIDN'T WANT HIM TO HIT ME ANYMORE. TELL ME, THEN WHAT HAPPENED? HE STARTED TOWARD ME, AND I SAID, "PLEASE LEAVE. I MEAN IT." BUT HE NEVER PAID ANY ATTENTION TO ME, EVER, IN ALL THE YEARS THAT WE WERE TOGETHER. AND HE CAME FORWARD, AND I TOLD HIM TO STOP. I KEPT BACKING UP, GETTING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM HIM. AND HE LAUGHED AT ME. HE TOOK A STEP FORWARD, AND I SHOT HIM. [ SNIFFLES, EXHALES ] I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. WHAT DOES THAT SOUND LIKE? MANSLAUGHTER TWO. WHAT KIND OF TIME? THAT WOULD TEND TO BE THE JUDGE'S DECISION. YEAH, I KNOW, BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND. A GUESS? THREE YEARS. WHICH HE MIGHT SUSPEND. WHICH HE MIGHT SUSPEND.
