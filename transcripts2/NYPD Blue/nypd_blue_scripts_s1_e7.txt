 NYPD Blue (1993–2005): Season 1, Episode 7 - NYPD Lou - full transcript 
 A shady homeless man, named Lou, comes to the station thinking he's a werewolf and demands to be locked up into a cell before he kills someone when the night comes. However, things take a turn when Kelly investigates Lou when he may be a witness in the murder of a nine-year-old immigrant boy. Meanwhile, Sipowicz is visited by his long-estranged son, Andy Sipowicz, Jr. with his fiancée, Patty Constance, an older woman who Sipowicz discovers that she has been cheating on Andy Jr. Elsewhere, Giardella is killed in his hotel room by a Mafia button man dressed as a window washer before he can testify to a grand jury against his superiors and Laura finds herself the only witness to the murder.
