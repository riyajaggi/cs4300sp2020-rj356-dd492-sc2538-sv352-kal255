WE HAVE NO CASE UNLESS WE CAN GET HANLAN ON RECORD. ‐ HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WEARING A WIRE? ‐ I DON'T WANT TO. THEN WE CAN'T PROCEED. I SAID I DON'T WANT TO. I DIDN'T SAY I WOULDN'T. THIS GUY MADE AN OLD MAN DIE. HE PROBABLY KILLED AN OLD WOMAN TOO. HE ABUSED MY BROTHER. I DON'T WANT TO, BUT... IF IT TAKES WEARING A WIRE TO POP THIS GUY, THEN THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

CAN I OFFER YOU A LITTLE LIQUOR DRINK? SURE. COME ON IN. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR, JOHN? YOU WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR FATHER? I'D LIKE THAT. WELL, HE MIGHT HAVE MADE CHIEF OF DETECTIVES IF HE HADN'T GOT SHOT. YOU WANNA KNOW WHY? BECAUSE HE KNEW THE JOB. NOT THE MANUAL, THE JOB. SIT DOWN. BACK THEN, WE HAD AN IRISH DEPARTMENT. WE HAD SOME GUINEAS. WE HAD JEWS. WE HAD A FEW NIGGERS, BUT IT WAS AN IRISH DEPARTMENT. AND THIS CITY WAS LIVEABLE. HARLEM, BEFORE THE '64 RIOTS, YOU COULD WALK DOWN THE STREET. YOU COULD DO YOUR SHOPPING. YOU COULD TALK TO THE SPADES LIKE PEOPLE. THEY EVEN TREATED EACH OTHER LIKE HUMAN BEINGS. YOU'RE A YOUNG GUY, KELLY. YOU GREW UP IN A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT... IN A DIFFERENT CITY. YOU PROBABLY THINK I'M A RACIST. I THINK YOU'RE A LOUSY BARTENDER. [ SCOFFS ] I'M TRYING TO PAINT A PICTURE FOR YOU OF THIS CITY, THE DEPARTMENT YOUR OLD MAN WAS PART OF. HE, UH‐‐ HE SET A STANDARD FOR HIMSELF AND FOR THE PEOPLE ON THE STREET. EVERY SCUMBAG CRIMINAL OUT THERE KNEW THERE WAS A LINE. AND IF HE CROSSED IT, HE WAS IN TROUBLE. NOT TOO MANY CROSSED IT. AND IF THEY DID, THEY NEVER DID IT TWICE. HOW DID IT FEEL LIVING IN THE PERFECT SOCIETY? IT'S ALL RIGHT. JOKE AROUND. BUT IF SOME SKELL RAPED AN OLD LADY, HE MIGHT FIND HIMSELF THROWN OFF A ROOF. THAT WAS CALLED OFFICER DISCRETION BACK THEN. MY OLD MAN EVER THROW ANYBODY OFF A BUILDING? I WOULDN'T KNOW. THAT'S NOT THE POINT THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE. WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO WORK WITH HIM? I ONLY SAW HIM AT THE CRIME SCENES. WE NEVER WORKED ONE‐ON‐ONE. I WAS ON PATROL. HE WAS A DETECTIVE. BUT EVERYBODY KNEW WHAT KIND OF A GUY HE WAS. I THOUGHT YOU WERE BUDDIES. I SAID I KNEW HIM. WE ALL KNEW HIM. WE KNEW WE COULD COUNT ON EACH OTHER. [ SIGHS ] I GOT A PROBLEM, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I THINK YOU DID SOMETHING TO THE OLD MAN UPSTAIRS. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THAT OLD GUY FELL. THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT. NAILS WERE PULLED, FRESH SCREWDRIVER MARKS. YOUR PRINTS WERE ALL OVER THAT BANISTER. THAT'S A MAKABLE CASE. YOU'RE A BETTER DETECTIVE THAN THAT. IF THEY LIFTED ONE PRINT OFF THAT BANISTER, THEY LIFTED 50. OTHER TENANTS DESCRIBED A PATTERN OF HARASSMENT. THE OLD MAN IS DEAD. WHAT AM I GONNA DO ABOUT THIS?

DON'T MENTION MY FATHER'S NAME AGAIN, YOU MURDERING SON OF A BITCH. ‐ THIS WOULD MAKE HIM SICK! ‐ SHUT UP, HANLAN. GET HIM UPSTAIRS. [ GRUNTING ] EVERYBODY IN THE DEPARTMENT'S GOTTA KNOW...

ALPHONSE GIARDELLA? I'M JAMES CRAIG. THIS IS LAURA MICHAELS. MR. CRAIG, MS. MICHAELS. I ARRANGED FOR SOME REFRESHMENTS. OYSTERS. VERY SENSUAL.

I WANT YOU TO START WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DOMINICAN, AGOSTO REYES. I DON'T HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH KNUCKLE BOUNCERS. I DEALT SOME SMACK TO THE 'YOM IS ALL. HE USED MAYBE FOUR KEYS A MONTH, MAYBE THREE, FOUR PERCENT OF MY PIE. HE EVER MENTIONED HIS DEALINGS WITH JESUS AND RIGOBERTO COLON TO YOU? ONE MONTH HE PICKS UP HIS FOUR KEYS, COMES BACK FOUR DAYS LATER. I SAY, "NICE WORK, REYES. QUICK TURNAROUND." REYES TELLS ME IT'S NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL. HE SAYS HE FRONTED THESE COLON BROTHERS THE WHOLE FOUR KEYS, AND THEY COME BACK WITH A STORY ABOUT BEING RIPPED OFF. AT THIS POINT AGOSTO REYES TELLS ME‐‐ HE BECOMES VERY INDIGNANT ON MY BEHALF. HE SAYS, "I WHACKED BOTH THOSE SONS OF BITCHES." THOSE WERE HIS EXACT WORDS, "I WHACKED BOTH THE SONS OF BITCHES"? YEAH, YEAH, HIS EXACT WORDS. [ SLURPING ] [ CRAIG ] WHAT WAS YOUR RESPONSE? WHAT DO I CARE ABOUT HIS STORY? HE GETS TAKEN OFF, THAT'S HIS PROBLEM. HE WHACKS THE COLON BROTHERS, THAT'S HIS PROBLEM. OKAY, MR. GIARDELLA, THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL. YOU KNOW, AGOSTO REYES... [ CLEARS THROAT ] WAS ONLY ONE OF MY PEOPLE. I GOT A LOT OF OTHERS. YOU GOT ABOUT HALF OF 'EM IN YOUR JAIL. THOSE CASES BELONG TO OTHER PROSECUTORS, OTHER JURISDICTION.

DID YOU KNOW MARTINEZ IS REGGIE JACKSON'S MIDDLE NAME? NO. WE CUT UP A PIECE OF GRASS. HE'S STILL GOT THAT. HE TAKES CARE OF IT. I KNOW HE'S NOT GONE. THE DOPE HASN'T EATEN HIM UP YET. DON'T BE AFRAID TO REACH OUT TO HIM. YOU READ ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT TOUGH LOVE, LETTING 'EM HIT ROCK BOTTOM? DON'T BE AFRAID TO REACH OUT TO HIM. OKAY? OKAY. I WISH I COULD BE MORE HELPFUL THAN THAT. YOU HELPED ME PLENTY, DETECTIVE. REALLY. THANKS AGAIN. [ PEOPLE CHATTERING ] [ PHONES RINGING ] HEY, JOHN, COULD I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE? SURE.

D., YOU KNOW? [ CHUCKLING ] ANYWAY, UM, IF YOU'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HELP, I WANNA LISTEN. YOU'LL LISTEN, MEDAVOY, HUH? YOU COME UP, CLEARING YOUR THROAT... LIKE A SENATOR, SAYING YOU'LL LISTEN? HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SAY DICK TO YOU. ANDY. THE COP KELLY PUT AWAY KILLED AN 80‐YEAR‐OLD MAN. HE LET HIM FALL THROUGH A BALCONY AND BREAK HIS NECK. HE CROAKED ANOTHER LADY, SUFFOCATED HER WITH GAS FOR MONEY TO CLEAR OUT AN APARTMENT BUILDING. I SAID I WANTED TO LISTEN! I WANTED TO LISTEN. KELLY STOOD IN FOR A KID WITH TWO YEARS ON THE JOB WHO WAS GONNA HAVE TO WEAR A WIRE, AND THAT WOULD'VE PUT THAT KID ON THE RAT SQUAD. KELLY DID THE RIGHT THING. AND IF YOU OR ANY OTHER ONE OF YOU GUYS GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT, YOU CAN SEE ME IN THE PARKING LOT RIGHT NOW. ‐ YOU TOOK ME ALL WRONG! ‐ [ KELLY ] ANDY, THAT'S ENOUGH. YOU NEVER GIVE ME A CHANCE TO‐TO‐‐ TO EXPLAIN WHAT I'M SAYING. MEDAVOY, HOLD IT. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO SAY, OKAY, AND I APPRECIATE THE OFFER.

WHAT'S THIS? WHAT YOU STOPPIN' HERE FOR? I WANNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT ROBERTO. WELL, THIS IS A HOSPITAL. DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HIM? IS HE HURT? WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHAT'S GOING ON? HE'S SICK, PAPI. HE'S IN THE CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY UNIT. WHAT THE HELL IS A CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY UNIT? IT'S WHERE THEY HELP PEOPLE ADDICTED TO DRUGS. WELL, YOU GO IN. PAPI. LOOK, I DON'T LIKE JUNKIES, I DON'T WANNA SEE A JUNKIE‐‐ ROBERTO IS SICK, PAPI, AND HE NEEDS US! NO, NO, HE'S A JUNKIE. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? AND JUNKIES DON'T GET BETTER. YOU GOT IT?

WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER, OKAY? IT'S BETTER. OKAY. [ BLOWING ] HOW ARE THEY TREATIN' THE KID? [ SIREN WAILING ] IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. THAT'S GOOD. I'M THINKING, KELLY‐‐ I'M THINKING MAYBE THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE PROGRESS IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AFTER ALL. I REMEMBER 15 YEARS AGO A ROOKIE COP WALKS INTO A D. O. A. SCENE, SEES HIS PARTNER TAKING MONEY OFF A DEAD PERSON AND PUTTING IT INTO HIS POCKET. AND FOR GIVING HIM UP, THIS ROOKIE IS HUNG OUT TO DRY BY EVERY COP ON THE JOB. YOU CAN SEE HOW NICE IT WAS FOR ME... WATCHING YOU BUST YOUR ASS FOR THAT KID. I WISH IT COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT FOR YOU, KEVIN. YOU STILL GO TO THE EMERALD SOCIETY? NO. NO, I CAN'T DRINK LIKE THAT ANYMORE. I DON'T GO. NO ONE WILL TALK TO ME. THEY'RE ALL AFRAID THEY'LL GET DRUNK, CONFESS THEIR SINS AND I'LL ARREST THEM. YOU KNOW, I DON'T CARE ABOUT NO ONE TALKING TO ME. I KNEW THAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN I BUSTED THAT COP. BUT I ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY IN THE EMERALD SOCIETY PIPER'S BAND, AND NOT ONE OF THOSE BASTARDS WILL RECOMMEND ME. I'M THE BEST PIPER IN THE DEPARTMENT, AND NOBODY KNOWS IT... EXCEPT A BUNCH OF CROAKERS. YOU KNOW WHAT "PIOBRACHT" IS, KELLY? NO. WELL, LISTEN.
