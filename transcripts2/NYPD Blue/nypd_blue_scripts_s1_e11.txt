 NYPD Blue (1993–2005): Season 1, Episode 11 - From Hare to Eternity - full transcript 
 As Christmas draws near, the zone commander, Haverill, starts to come down on Lt. Fancy about his work skills and Sipowicz later intervenes and threatens Haverill to lay off Fancy or he will reveal some incriminating evidence about him being a racist. Meanwhile, Kelly and Sipowicz investigate the kidnapping of a doctor's daughter. Janice must pass some more information to the mob about the station's moves and wonders how she will get out of this situation. Also, Martinez and Medavoy question a woman and her young son who claim to have been robbed by a man who picked them up while they were hitchhiking in North Carolina. But Martinez later discovers that the woman, Kathy, is not who she claims to be, which leads to a hostage situation, involving Donna, at the station. Sipowicz reluctantly plays Santa as the precinct's annual Christmas party, and Martinez receives his gift from Lt. Fancy when he is promoted to detective, while Medavoy panics when the station's pet cat eats the Christmas rabbit, and Kelly visits his Alzheimers-stricken mother who resides in a nursing home.

UH, I GUESS HE'S WAITIN' FOR THE LIEUTENANT. NOW, YOU SEE, THAT MUCH I FIGURED ON MY OWN, MEDAVOY, ON ACCOUNT OF HE'S STANDIN' IN FANCY'S OFFICE. I WAS MORE WONDERIN', DO WE KNOW WHAT HE WANTS? ALL'S I KNOW IS HE'S GETTIN' TO BE A REGULAR. HAVERILL'S GONNA NEED A CAMPING PERMIT, HUH? I CAN'T MAKE THESE NUMBERS WORK. I DON'T SEE THE CASELOAD TO‐TO WARRANT THE OVERTIME YOU'RE PUTTING THROUGH. OBVIOUSLY, I DISAGREE. YOU WOULDN'T BE BUYING YOUR SQUAD'S LOYALTY AT TIME AND A HALF, WOULD YOU? CAPTAIN, THE LAST TIME, IT WAS MY CLEARANCE RATE. THE TIME BEFORE THAT, IT WAS CASE MANAGEMENT. AND BOTH THOSE CONVERSATIONS WERE AS BOGUS AS THIS ONE. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU THINK I'M SECRETLY PLEASED... WITH THE JOB YOU'RE DOING, AND I JUST DON'T REALIZE IT? I THINK ALL YOUR CARDS AREN'T FACE UP. YOU WANT A COMMAND SLOT TO OPEN, AND I'M THE CANDIDATE TO GET MOVED ALONG. IF YOU FEEL WE'VE GOT A PERSONALITY CONFLICT, MAYBE YOU SHOULD PUT IN FOR TRANSFER. UH‐UH, CAPTAIN. YOU THINK I AUTHORIZE TOO MUCH OVERTIME? YOU DON'T LIKE MY CLEARANCE RATE? GO ON RECORD AT THE BOROUGH, 'CAUSE I STAND BY HOW I COMMAND. YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS THE EASY WAY, HUH, ARTHUR? MOVE ALONG ON YOUR OWN STEAM. JUST DON'T PUT THIS ON STAGE. DON'T YOU UNDERMINE ME IN FRONT OF MY PEOPLE. TRUST ME. IF I WANT YOU GONE, YOU'RE GONE. YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T GET HERE EASY, AND I WON'T BE GOING EASY EITHER. WHAT DO YOU KNOW, ANDY? HOW'S IT GOIN'? MERRY CHRISTMAS. YEAH, SAME TO YOU. EITHER I OR DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ WILL PICK IT UP. DID YOU GET THE SPOT OUT OF THE FUZZY COLLAR? OH, THAT'S GREAT. THAT HYPOCRITE BASTARD HAVERILL KNOWS FANCY'S DOIN' THE JOB. HE JUST WANTS TO MOVE HIS OWN MAN IN THERE. PROBABLY THAT ASS‐KISSER MURPHY. HOW COME HE'S GOT SUCH A BIG SMILE FOR YOU? WHO KNOWS? SCREW HIM ANYWAY. MAYBE HE LIKES YOUR SUNNY DISPOSITION. YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH MY DISPOSITION? YEAH. I'M JUST WONDERIN' WHERE THE BIG MISTAKE'S GONNA HAPPEN THIS YEAR‐‐ WHERE I'M GONNA CREATE A DISASTER AREA FOR THE HOLIDAYS. WHO SAYS THERE'S GOTTA BE A DISASTER? [ SIGHS ] COME ON, JOHN. THEY SET CLOCKS OFF OF ME. LAST YEAR‐‐ TODAY'S PROBABLY THE ANNIVERSARY‐‐ I WAS LOOKIN' TO BANG MY GOOD FRIEND, LOIS THE WHORE. I GO OVER TO HER ROOM, I PUSH OPEN THE DOOR, I TAKE DOWN MY PANTS. OF COURSE, IT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE LOIS. I WAS IN THE WRONG ROOM. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT WASN'T THERE SOME ALCOHOLIC INVOLVEMENT IN THAT INCIDENT? LUCKY THE HOTEL WAS ALL HOOKERS, HUH? LUCKY I HAD THE 20 BUCKS. NO, ALL I'M SAYIN' IS THAT IT COULD BE DIFFERENT WITH YOU BEIN' OFF THE BOOZE, THAT'S ALL. YEAH, YEAH, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. I MEAN, I GET TO PLAY SANTA CLAUS THIS YEAR. HAND OUT THE PRECIOUS GIFT OF MERCHANDISE TO ALL THESE DEPRIVED KIDS. MAYBE SOME OF 'EM ACTUALLY DIDN'T TRY TO BREAK INTO MY CAR ON THEIR WAY TO SCHOOL. THEN MAYBE THERE'S SOMEBODY YOU CAN TALK TO ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY PROFESSIONAL. I'M SURE YOU MEAN WELL BY THAT QUESTION. [ FANCY ] HEY, KELLY? THINK ABOUT IT. WE GOT A KIDNAPPING. GO IN SOFT CLOTHES. OKAY. WHAT TIME DID YOU GET THE RANSOM CALL? RIGHT AFTER I GOT HERE AT 9:00 THIS MORNING. YOU RECOGNIZE THE VOICE? IT WAS MALE. HE SOUNDED PRETTY YOUNG. SAID HE'D CALL BACK IN TWO HOURS. I CANCELED ALL YOUR APPOINTMENTS, SPOKE TO LEONARD AT THE BANK. HE CAN HAVE THE MONEY READY IN A COUPLE OF HOURS. YOU WANNA TELL US WHAT THAT'S ABOUT, DOCTOR? THEY'VE ASKED FOR $100,000 RANSOM. UH, I'LL PAY ANYTHING. OKAY, WE CAN'T TELL YOU NOT TO DO THAT, BUT WE WOULD LIKE A CHANCE TO RECORD AND MARK SOME OF THOSE BILLS. LOOK, DETECTIVE, THESE PEOPLE ARE GONNA GET THEIR MONEY WHENEVER AND WHEREVER THEY WANT IT. NOW, I‐I DON'T CARE IF IT'S RECOVERED OR IF THEY'RE EVEN CAUGHT. ALL I WANT IS MY LITTLE GIRL BACK. WHAT TIME YOU DROP HER OFF AT SCHOOL THIS MORNING? I DID THAT. I PICK TINA UP AT 7:30 AND DROP HER AT SCHOOL BY 8:00. DR. SACHS GOES THE OPPOSITE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL. ‐ YOU DO THAT EVERY DAY? ‐ THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. IS THAT TELLING YOU SOMETHING? [ SIPOWICZ ] IT JUST MEANS THAT... IT WAS, UH, IT WAS AN EASY JOB. LOOK, WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME PICTURES AND A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT SHE WAS WEARIN'. OKAY, DOCTOR, WE'RE GONNA LEAVE HERE NOW AND WORK OUT OF THE STATION... IN CASE ANYBODY'S WATCHING THE OFFICE. WE DON'T WANT THEM AWARE OF OUR COMINGS AND GOINGS. THE PHONE COMPANY WILL PUT A TRAP ON THE PHONE TO MONITOR THE LOCATION OF ANY CALLS. ONE OF OUR PEOPLE WILL COME OUT AND PUT A RECORDER ON THE LINE SO WE CAN MONITOR... THE TIME OF THE CALLS. I DON'T WANT MY DAUGHTER PUT AT RISK. THIS WON'T PUT HER AT RISK. IF WE CAN PUT A TRACE ON THE CALL, THEN WE CAN PUT SURVEILLANCE ON THE LOCATION OF THE CALL. I AM GONNA PAY THIS MONEY, I AM GONNA GET MY DAUGHTER, AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO INTERFERE. ‐ DOCTOR, IS THIS YOUR FIRST KIDNAPPING? ‐ ANDY‐‐ YOU REALLY THINK THAT SARCASM IS APPROPRIATE HERE, DETECTIVE? NOBODY'S BEIN' SARCASTIC. ME AND MY PARTNER GOT MORE EXPERIENCE AT THIS THAN YOU DO. NOW SOMETIMES, PEOPLE PAY THE MONEY AND THEY DON'T GET THEIR CHILD BACK. I'VE WORKED THOSE CASES, LOOKIN' FOR A CHILD FROM A COLD START. ‐ OKAY, ANDY‐‐ ‐ I DON'T LIKE FINDIN' SOME OF THOSE KIDS. ‐ WHAT DO YOU MEAN? ‐ WHAT DO YOU THINK I MEAN? [ KELLY ] DOCTOR, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST US. WE'LL WORK WITH YOU. LET US DO OUR JOB. AND HOPEFULLY, SOMETHING WILL COME OUT OF THIS. DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. LIEUTENANT, WE'RE ALL SET UP FOR THE CALL IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE. DID HE COOPERATE ON THE RANSOM? THE BANK XEROXED ALL THE BILLS. THE F. B. I.'S BEEN NOTIFIED. THEY WANT US TO KEEP 'EM INFORMED.
