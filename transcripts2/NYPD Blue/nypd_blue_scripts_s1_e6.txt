 NYPD Blue (1993–2005): Season 1, Episode 6 - Personal Foul - full transcript 
 A minor skirmish on a basketball court leaves one of Kelly's friends dead and the other one in jail for manslaughter. Meanwhile, Sipowicz is convinced that a man knows more about his wife's death in a highway shooting than he is letting on. Laura feels as though she's being dangled in front of Giardella when Sylvia tells her to push on him harder. Janice saves Kelly's life during a drug raid and the event seems to bring them back together.

ONCE THE MEDICAL REPORT IS IN, I CAN TESTIFY‐‐ IS THAT SUPPOSED TO REASSURE ME? I CAN'T BE AT THE LATE ARRAIGNMENT, BUT I WILL DEFINITELY SEE NATHAN LATER. IF YOU GET TO TALK TO HIM IN COURT, PLEASE TELL HIM TO CALM DOWN 'CAUSE IT'S ONLY GONNA MAKE IT WORSE. HE LEFT YESTERDAY MORNING... TO GO PLAY BASKETBALL. I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

WE'RE LOOKING INTO EVERY POSSIBILITY AND MOTIVE FOR HOW YOUR WIFE GOT SHOT. I THINK YOU'D WANT US TO DO THAT. NOBODY'S SINGLING YOU OUT.

KELLY AND SIPOWICZ, YOU KNOW LICALSI AND LUCAS. HOW YOU DOING? LUCAS AND LICALSI WERE WORKING STREET CONDITIONS. THEY BUSTED A COUPLE A STREET DEALERS WHO ROLLED...

WHILE YOU'RE SUCKING FRESH AIR AND BRINGING ME FOOD LIKE A MONKEY IN A ZOO, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I'M SUPPOSED TO BEHAVE? SOMEBODY'S GOT TO. WHAT WAS THE POINT OF SLUGGING THIS GUARD? HE PUT HIS HANDS ON ME. THAT IS STUPID. THAT IS ACTING LIKE A CON. TELL ME THE TRUTH, JOHN. IF YOU HAD HIT LARRY, WOULD YOU BE IN HERE NOW? BETTER YET, IF I WAS YOUR BROTHER, WOULD I BE IN HERE NOW? NATHAN, I DID WHAT I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO ON THE BASKETBALL COURT. BUT FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, LET'S JUST SAY I DID LET YOU DOWN. IS THAT ANY EXCUSE TO THROW AWAY THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? MY LIFE HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN AWAY. THERE IS A LOT WE CAN DO. YOU NEVER MEANT TO HURT LARRY. YOU WERE PROVOKED. A GRAND JURY, NATHAN, WILL PROBABLY SEE THAT. IT'S NO SECRET LARRY WAS A LOUDMOUTHED DOUCHE BAG, MAY HE REST IN PEACE. PLUS, THERE'S THE GUARD. I'M GONNA REACH OUT TO HIM AND MAYBE HE WILL CUT YOU SOME SLACK. YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE OF THAT?

THIS TECHNIQUE IS KNOWN AS "IMMOBILIZATION PATTERING." RIGHT? IT REQUIRES COMPLETE CONTROL AND COMMAND OF YOUR WEAPON. THE IDEA BEING THAT YOU PEG SHOTS... AROUND THE BODY PERIMETER OF THE PERPETRATOR, CAUSING HIM TO FREEZE UP AND BECOME IMMOBILE. [ BOTH LAUGHING ] YEAH, IT GREW OUT OF WATCHING HATCHET‐THROWERS... AT CARNIVALS WHEN I WAS A KID.

THAT'S BEEN MY INCLINATION FOR A WHILE TOO. MY MARRIAGE IS OVER, SO‐‐ I'VE BEEN ALONE TOO MUCH, AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO... HAVE SOMEBODY TO BE WITH AND TALK TO. I KNOW. THE THING IS, WITH MARINO AND THE OTHER DEAD GUY ASIDE, MY PROBLEM IS‐‐ YOU APPROACHED ME BECAUSE HE TOLD YOU TO, RIGHT? OKAY. BUT WE WOUND UP IN BED BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE THERE. AND I WANNA BELIEVE THAT. BELIEVE IT. WHAT ABOUT THE TWO DEAD GUYS IN THE CAR? THEY TOLD ME TO KILL YOU. I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I HAD ANY OTHER CHOICE BUT TO DO WHAT I DID. I'M NOT SAYING I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WERE OTHER WAYS TO GO. BUT WITH THE SITUATION WITH MY FATHER, I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I COULD TURN THEM IN. I'VE GONE OVER AND OVER THIS, AND‐‐ ENOUGH. ALL RIGHT. I HEAR YA. I HEAR YA. I GUESS I COULD TAKE FOREVER TO MAKE MY MIND UP ABOUT US, HUH? MEANWHILE, OUR LIVES ARE GOING BY. YOU TAKE AS MUCH TIME AS YOU NEED, JOHN. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

NO WITNESSES OR INFORMATION THERE EITHER. ON GERALD ZIMMER, HE'S GOT DECENT CREDIT, NO APPARENT MONEY PROBLEMS. HIS INSURANCE‐‐ IF ANYTHING, HE'S UNDERINSURED. HE HAD A TERM INSURANCE POLICY ON HIMSELF FOR $200,000... AND $35,000 ON HIS WIFE. ‐ TOOK THOSE OUT IN MAY. ‐ HOW WOULD YOU PROCEED? IF SOMEONE MADE ME GUESS, I'D SAY IT WAS A RANDOM POTSHOT FROM ANOTHER VEHICLE. I SUPPOSE I'D WORK UP REQUESTING‐INFORMATION FLYERS FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE THERE'D BE TO DO. WORK UP THE FLYERS. GIVE 'EM TO THE UNIFORM FORCE TO DISTRIBUTE TWICE A WEEK. ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS, PUT YOURSELVES BACK ON THE WHEEL. GOOD, KID. START CATCHING NEW CASES. THANKS FOR THE HELP, MARTINEZ. NO PROBLEM, LIEUTENANT. I'M GOING OVER TO NATHAN'S GRAND JURY HEARING. I HOPE ALL THAT WORKS OUT. THANKS. MARTINEZ, YOU GOT THAT WORK‐UP ON THE HUSBAND? YEAH. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. YEAH. I WANNA AGITATE THIS GUY A LITTLE. ‐ WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? ‐ I DON'T KNOW. HE RUBS ME THE WRONG WAY. ‐ I'LL SEE YOU LATER. ‐ YEAH. AH, MR. ZIMMER. DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ, 15 SQUAD. YEAH, HOW YOU DOING? NO, I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THAT THERE WAS A BREAKTHROUGH. WE'RE JUST FOLLOWING UP ON A FEW THINGS HERE. LISTEN. WE SAW THAT YOU RECENTLY TOOK OUT AN INSURANCE POLICY ON YOUR WIFE. I WANTED TO ASK YOU WAS THERE A PARTICULAR‐‐ HEY, MR. ZIMMER, YOU WANNA EASE OFF ON THE PROFANITY? I DIDN'T SAY THAT. NO ONE IS ACCUSING YOU OF ANYTHING. WE TOOK NOTICE BECAUSE YOU TOOK OUT THAT POLICY ON HER PRETTY RECENTLY. UH‐HUH. AS A RIDER ON YOUR OWN POLICY, VIRTUALLY A FREEBIE. I SEE. WELL, I SUPPOSE THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN IT. HEY, HEY, MR. ZIMMER, I'M TALKING TO YOU IN A RESPECTFUL WAY, AND I'M MAKING LEGITIMATE INQUIRIES HERE, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING SO EXCITED ABOUT. YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO HIDE, NOW, DO YOU? YOU SEEM TO FLY OFF THE HANDLE ANYTIME ANYBODY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. NO. I DIDN'T SAY YOU HAD ANYTHING TO HIDE. I SAID IF YOU DON'T, I WONDER WHY YOU'RE SO IRRITABLE. ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M SORRY YOU FEEL HARASSED. HERE YOU GO. I'LL SAY GOOD‐BYE NOW. ALL RIGHT. YEAH. I'LL BE IN TOUCH. THE OTHER NAMED WITNESSES AND MYSELF WERE PLAYING IN A THREE‐ON‐THREE BASKETBALL GAME. MOST OF US ARE CLOSE FRIENDS AND THE GAME HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS. THIS DAY THERE WAS A DISPUTE OVER SOME CALLS. THE DECEASED BEGAN PUSHING MR. FOSTER... AND HAD BECOME VERBALLY ABUSIVE TO HIM. WHEN MR. FOSTER ATTEMPTED TO WALK AWAY, THE DECEDENT CONTINUED TO PUSH. FINALLY, MR. FOSTER PUNCHED HIM IN THE FACE ONCE. HE WENT DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND IMMEDIATELY INTO ARREST. HE WAS PRONOUNCED OFFICIALLY DEAD ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATER. DETECTIVE KELLY, DID YOU SEE THE DECEDENT ASSAULT... OR THREATEN MR. FOSTER IN ANY WAY... PRIOR TO MR. FOSTER STRIKING THE BLOW? THE DECEDENT WAS MAKING RACIAL REMARKS AND REPEATEDLY PUSHING MR. FOSTER. DID IT APPEAR TO YOU IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY... THAT MR. FOSTER WAS AT RISK OR FELT HIMSELF TO BE AT RISK BECAUSE OF THIS PUSHING? THAT HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO DEFEND HIMSELF. I DON'T THINK HE WAS AT RISK. I THINK HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO FEND OFF MR. KOHNSTAM. I DIDN'T ASK IF HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO FEND HIM OFF. WAS HE DEFENDING HIMSELF? I WANNA BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE... BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA CAUSE THESE FAMILIES ANY ADDITIONAL UNDUE GRIEF. THIS WAS NOT A VIOLENT OR VICIOUS CONFRONTATION. ONE MAN WAS BEING VERBALLY PROVOKED AND REPEATEDLY PUSHED. HE STRUCK A BLOW IN RESPONSE TO THAT. THE RESULT WAS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION WITH THE INTENT. I MADE THE ARREST BECAUSE THAT'S MY JOB, NOT BECAUSE I THOUGHT I SAW A HOMICIDE. BUT IN ANSWER TO MY SPECIFIC QUESTION, YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION IS THAT THE BLOW, WHILE IT MAY HAVE BEEN PROVOKED BY IRRITATION OR ANGER, WAS NOT STRUCK IN SELF‐DEFENSE. DETECTIVE. ‐ I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT. ‐ YOU'RE EXCUSED, OFFICER. HEY, GUYS. HOW'D IT GO IN THERE? WE'LL SEE. YOU SEND THE WREATH TO SEATTLE? YEAH. I SPOKE TO KOHNSTAM'S MOTHER. THEY GOT IT. WHAT WAS ON THE CARD? "HE ALWAYS HAD A BIG MOUTH." NO, WE JUST PUT "WITH SYMPATHY" AND ALL OUR NAMES. WHERE'S CURLY? WE NEED HIM. HE SAID HE'D BE HERE. WAS NATHAN IN THERE? HE'S GONNA BE AT THE ARRAIGNMENT FOR THE OTHER CHARGE. I'M GONNA FIND THIS GUARD HE HAD THE BEEF WITH, BUT PLEASE CALL CURLY. WE NEED HIM HERE. HE'LL BE HERE, JOHN. HE'LL BE HERE. CALL HIM AGAIN, WILL YOU? ALL RIGHT. MR. ZIMMER. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT'S GOING ON IS YOU'RE GONNA STOP BADGERING ME. WE'RE GONNA PUT AN END TO THE PERSECUTION... AND THE SUBTLE ACCUSATIONS AND THE INNUENDO. THAT'S A GREAT VOCABULARY YOU GOT THERE. WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? I'VE TAKEN A LIE DETECTOR TEST, DETECTIVE. I'M GIVING YOU THE RESULTS AND ASKING YOU TO LEAVE ME ALONE. NORMAN HOLMGREN GAVE YOU THE TEST, HUH? I'M TOLD YOUR DEPARTMENT USES HIM REGULARLY. YEAH, WE DO. HE'S A GOOD EXAMINER. UH, WHY DON'T YOU COME ON UPSTAIRS A MINUTE, MR. ZIMMER. NO, I THINK WE'VE FINISHED OUR BUSINESS, DETECTIVE. AH, COME ON. WE CAN HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE WHILE I LOOK THIS OVER. COME ON. WE'LL BE MORE COMFORTABLE UP THERE. ALL RIGHT? BOY, YOU ANSWERED THIS TEST WITH FLYING COLORS, DIDN'T YOU? YES, I DID. THESE NEEDLES DIDN'T EVEN BUDGE. "DID YOU KILL YOUR WIFE JOAN?" "NO." "EXAMINER'S OPINION‐‐ SUBJECT ANSWERED TRUTHFULLY." "DID YOU FIRE A GUN?" "NO." "ANSWERED TRUTHFULLY." "WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY WAY IN A PLAN TO KILL YOUR WIFE?" "NO." "DID YOU INTEND TO KILL YOUR WIFE?" "NO." "SUBJECT ANSWERED TRUTHFULLY." SUBJECT ANSWERED TRUTHFULLY IS RIGHT. CAN I GO NOW? YOU'RE FREE TO GO WHENEVER YOU WANT, MR. ZIMMER. SUPPOSE I SET UP A TEST NOW DOWN AT POLICE PLAZA? COULD YOU GO DOWNTOWN WITH ME? WHAT KIND OF A TEST? ANOTHER LIE DETECTOR TEST. WHAT FOR? DID YOU WRITE OUT THE QUESTIONS ON THIS TEST YOU JUST TOOK? THIS TEST WAS ADMINISTERED BY A REPUTABLE POLYGRAPH EXAMINER. YOU STILL INSIST ON QUESTIONING MY HONESTY? YOU INSIST ON HARASSING ME? IF IT WAS ME, I'D HAVE ASKED, "DO YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT YOUR WIFE'S DEATH THAN YOU'VE TOLD THE POLICE?" THAT ONE I DEFINITELY WOULD'VE HAD ON THERE. READ THE REPORT. I WAS NOT INVOLVED. WHAT IS TEARING YOU UP INSIDE, MR. ZIMMER, HUH? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WHAT DO YOU NEED TO TELL ME? I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU ANYTHING. NOW, LOOK, I'M NOT HERE TO JUDGE YOU, MR. ZIMMER. MAYBE YOU WERE FOOLING AROUND ON YOUR WIFE. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? DID YOU MAYBE HAVE A JEALOUS MISTRESS DID THIS... AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING THAT SHE HAD PLANNED? THAT'D GIVE YOU THE CLEAR POLYGRAPH TEST AND THAT'D MAKE YOU FEEL TERRIBLE NOW. OH, MY GOD. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? I DID IT! I KILLED HER! NOW, I'M INFORMING YOU RIGHT NOW THAT YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. BE QUIET A SECOND. IF YOU DON'T WANT AN ATTORNEY, I HAVE TO HEAR YOU DECLINE. I DECLINE AN ATTORNEY. I DECLINE. ‐ TELL ME HOW YOU KILLED HER. ‐ SHE BEGGED ME. SHE BEGGED ME TO STOP. I STILL KILLED HER. WHAT DID YOU DO? A MAN PASSED ME. HE CUT ME OFF. THIS IS ON THE F. D. R. DRIVE. THE SON OF A BITCH, HE CUT ME OFF AND HE GOT IN FRONT OF ME. SO I CAME UP ON THE INSIDE AND I CUT BACK IN FRONT OF HIM. I CUT HIM OFF THE WAY HE CUT ME OFF. AND THEN THIS KEPT ON FOR A WHILE. HE TRIED TO PASS ME. I SPED UP AND TRAPPED HIM INSIDE OF ANOTHER CAR. I GUESS HE GOT BEHIND ME AND I SLOWED DOWN AND TRAPPED HIM AGAIN. AND HE'S BLINKING HIS LIGHTS. HE'S MAKING OBSCENE GESTURES, AND SHE'S SCREAMING AT ME TO STOP. BUT I LOST MY TEMPER. AND HE CAME UP ON THE INSIDE, AND I SPED UP AND TRIED TO TRAP HIM AGAIN. AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW‐‐ YOU KNOW THE LAST THING SHE SAID TO ME? "YOUR WIFE AND THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD IS IN THIS CAR. WILL YOU PLEASE STOP?" AND THEN I HEARD A GUNSHOT, AND MY WIFE'S FACE IS COVERED WITH... BLOOD. CAN YOU HELP US WITH THE GUY? YES. I SAW HIM. I GOT THE LICENSE PLATE. I WAS TOO ASHAMED TO TELL YOU. [ KELLY ] YEAH. NO. YOU GOT HIM? THANKS A LOT. [ MARTINEZ ] GOT HIM. ‐ IS THAT THE GUY WHO WASTED ZIMMER'S WIFE? ‐ AND THE GUN. SO, HOW'D YOU MAKE OUT WITH NATHAN? GRAND JURY DIDN'T INDICT. MEDICAL EXAMINER FOUND A DISSECTING ANEURYSM. WHAT'S THAT IN ENGLISH? THE POOR BASTARD'S AORTA BLEW UP LIKE A CHEAP BALLOON. ‐ HE COULD'VE DIED COUGHING. ‐ SO YOUR PAL'S OFF THE HOOK. EXCEPT FOR THE ASSAULT ON THE CORRECTIONS OFFICER. [ PHONE RINGING ] KELLY. YEAH. OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. I'LL BE BACK. YOU KELLY? YEAH. I'M HARDWICK, CORRECTIONS. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
