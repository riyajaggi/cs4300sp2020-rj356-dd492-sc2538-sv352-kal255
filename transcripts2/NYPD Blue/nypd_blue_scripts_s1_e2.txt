TO ARREST THE DEFENDANT TREMAINE SAMPSON ON MARCH 7 OF THIS YEAR? ‐ YES, I DID. ‐ WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL THE COURT... THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH YOU MADE THE ARREST. UM, I WAS THE ASSIGNED DETECTIVE, UH, IN THE DEATH OF AN EIGHT‐YEAR‐OLD BOY, CURTIS DANIELS, WHO WAS, UH, SHOT ON AVENUE C ON HIS WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL. UH, THERE WERE NO WITNESSES TO THE INCIDENT, BUT DURING THE COURSE OF MY INVESTIGATION... I RECEIVED A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS FROM...

GIARDELLA'S A REALIST, GENTLEMEN. HE UNDERSTANDS THE SITUATION, AND HE'S PREPARED TO OFFER FULL COOPERATION. THAT MEANS COMPREHENSIVE DISCLOSURE OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES... INCLUDING TESTIMONY AT TRIAL... IN EXCHANGE FOR A PLEA ARRANGEMENT... THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE INCARCERATION. YOU'RE DREAMING. NO WAY YOU'D BEAT JAIL. I'M BRINGING A BIG PACKAGE. LIEUTENANT FANCY, I WANT TO HEAR WHAT'S ON THE TABLE. WHAT'S GOING ON? GIARDELLA'S OFFERING BREAKDOWNS ON ALL THE FAMILY CREWS‐‐ DETAILS ON THE JOBS THEY PULLED. HAVE YOU HAD ANY LINE‐OF‐DUTY INCIDENTS IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS? ANY CLOSE CALLS YOU DIDN'T REPORT? NO. WHY? GIARDELLA SAYS MARINO PUT OUT A CONTRACT ON YOU. HE THINKS YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HIT BY A COP, SOMEBODY YOU WORKED WITH. AND YOU BELIEVE HIM? THESE ARE THE COPS HE SAYS WERE ON MARINO'S PAYROLL. HE SAYS THERE ARE OTHERS THAT MARINO KEPT TO HIMSELF. NOBODY ON THIS LIST IS FROM THIS PRECINCT, BUT... I KNOW YOU'VE HAD SOME SHARED‐DUTY ASSIGNMENTS, SO‐‐ WHAT'S THE MATTER? [ FOLDING PAPER ] NOTHIN'. YOU RECOGNIZE SOMEBODY? NO. NO, I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY ON THAT LIST. I WANT YOU TO RUN A COMPUTER CHECK WITH THOSE NAMES AGAINST YOUR RECENT ASSIGNMENTS. OKAY. OKAY. YOU SEEN LICALSI? SECTOR PATROL. YOU JUST GOT A CALL FROM COURT. THE HOSTAGE SQUAD. WHAT HAPPENED? SOME CASE YOU WORKED ON. VICTIM'S RELATIVE'S GOT A GUN ON THE JUDGE. PERP'S NAME IS EPHRAIM DANIELS. HIS SON WAS MURDERED. I KNOW THE CASE. THEY WERE GONNA PLEAD IT OUT THIS MORNING. THE GUY WHO DID IT WAS ON FOR SENTENCING. DANIELS BREAKS INTO THE JUDGE'S CHAMBERS. WANTS HIM TO CANCEL THE PLEA‐‐ MAKE THE GUY GO TO TRIAL. SAYS YOU'RE THE ONLY COP HE'LL TALK TO. MR. DANIELS, IT'S DETECTIVE KELLY. JUST YOU. I GOT A GUN POINTED AT HIS HEAD. I'LL USE IT. DON'T PLAY WITH THIS GUY, DETECTIVE. THE JUDGE IS AT RISK AND I GOT A SHOOTER WITH A CLEAN ANGLE OUTSIDE THE OFFICE WINDOW. ‐ SHUT THE DOOR. ‐ CAN'T DO THAT, MR. DANIELS. YOU'VE GOT THE GUN. YOU'RE STILL IN CHARGE. GOTTA LET HIM GO, MR. DANIELS. [ DANIELS ] FOURTEEN MONTHS. FOURTEEN MONTHS... FOR KILLIN' AN EIGHT‐YEAR‐OLD BOY. I CAN'T LET HIM GIVE OUT THAT SENTENCE. I PROMISED MY BOY AT HIS GRAVE I WAS GONNA GIVE HIM SOME JUSTICE. MR. DANIELS, THERE IS NO JUSTICE FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BOY. AND I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU I AGREE WITH WHAT THE JUDGE DID. NOT LETTING THE GUN IN AS EVIDENCE... AND THE REST OF IT, I THINK THAT SUCKED. BUT NOTHING IS GONNA HAPPEN IN THIS ROOM THAT'S GONNA CHANGE ANY OF THAT. THE ONLY THING THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN HERE... IS YOU'RE GONNA GET IN ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE. ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME, MR. DANIELS? I'M LISTENING. I WANT YOU TO COME OUT HERE WITH ME. I PROMISE YOU...
