 NYPD Blue (1993–2005): Season 1, Episode 8 - Tempest in a C-Cup - full transcript 
 Kelly, Martinez, and the officers arrest Luis Hernandez, a baker, for a murder charge. But Detective Mike Roberts, as well as Detective Kelly, try to get him to confess to the robbery of four taxicabs so they can link him to the murder. Meanwhile, Sipowicz arrests a topless dancer for prostitution and she offers to help him get the owner of the bar who's laundering money for the mob. Laura questions Sylvia's ethics, who tries to protect her personal reputation and Sipowicz's verbal attacks on her. Also, Lt. Fancy and the rest of the squad welcomes the new administrative aide, a beautiful blond woman named Donna Abandando, whom the neurotic Detective Greg Medavoy finds irresistible.

I'M SUPPOSED TO TRUST YOU GUYS? FACTS ARE FACTS, RIGHT? ONE ARREST EQUALS ONE CONVICTION EQUALS ONE BIT IN THE JOINT. I CAN TELL THE D. A. AND THE JUDGE YOU COOPERATED.

HALFWAY TO PUERTO RICO. THAT'S STEP ONE. DETECTIVE, I KNOW I'M NEW TO THIS, BUT WE GOT THREE WITNESSES WHO'LL PUT HERNANDEZ RIGHT AT THE SHOOTING. WHY NOT CHARGE HIM WITH THE MURDER RIGHT NOW? WHY PLAY GAMES? OUR WITNESSES PLACE HIM IN THE VICINITY OF THE CRIME AROUND THE TIME OF DEATH. THAT'S NOT GONNA CUT IT. BY TRIAL TIME, WITNESSES DISAPPEAR, THEY GET SICK, THEY FORGET WHAT THEY SAW. WE WANT THE CONFESSION. WE GET THE CONFESSION, THEY NEVER GO AWAY. RIGHT. OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU IN THERE. THE TIME IS 11:18 A. M.

AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION... TO THE EVENTS OF OCTOBER 14 OF THIS YEAR, YOUR DEALINGS WITH A CAB DRIVER NAMED CHRISTIAN MFUME. JUST TAKE YOUR TIME, TELL ME EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED FROM BEGINNING TO END. OKAY. WELL, I GOT OFF WORK‐‐ WHAT TIME WAS THAT? I GET OFF WORK AT NOON. I CALLED THE LIBERTY CAB COMPANY FROM THE EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM. I TOLD THEM TO SEND ONE TO GREEN AND BOOKER. [ KELLY ] THAT'S THE LOCATION OF THE BAKERY YOU WORK AT? YEAH. IT'S LIKE A FEW BLOCKS AWAY. UH, WHEN THE CAB GOT THERE, I TOLD HIM TO GO TO REED STREET IN MANHATTAN. BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET THERE, SO I TOLD HIM. YOU TOLD MR. MFUME, THE DRIVER? YES. UH, HE DIDN'T KNOW DIRECTIONS MUCH, BEIN' THAT HE WAS LIKE AFRICAN OR SOMETHIN'. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? UH... WE GOT TO ELMORE STREET. I TOLD HIM TO PULL INTO THE ALLEY. BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO, SO I SHOWED HIM MY GUN... AND I TOLD HIM IF HE DIDN'T, SOMETHIN' BAD WOULD HAPPEN. [ KELLY ] WHAT KIND OF A GUN WAS IT? FORTY‐FIVE. UH... I SHOWED HIM THE GUN, HE DROVE INTO THE ALLEY AND I TOLD HIM, YOU KNOW, "GIVE ME YOUR MONEY, OR I'LL KILL YOU." SOMETHIN' LIKE THAT. I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY, BECAUSE THE GUN WAS JUST TO SCARE HIM. AND THEN HE GAVE ME THE MONEY. HOW MUCH MONEY DID HE GIVE YOU? UH... $72. I TOLD HIM TO STAY THERE FOR TEN MINUTES. "DON'T CALL ANYBODY ON YOUR RADIO, BECAUSE I'LL BE WATCHING." THEN I JUST RAN TO THE SUBWAY, 'CAUSE I KNEW THERE WAS A STOP NEAR THERE. OKAY. NOW I'D LIKE TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION... TO EVENTS ON OR ABOUT OCTOBER 18 OF THIS YEAR... REGARDING A CAB DRIVER NAMED WENDELL MCCOY. HEY, LAURA! WELCOME BACK. THANKS. YOU SURE YOU'RE READY TO BE HERE? YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. I NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK. IT'S YOUR CALL, LAURA. I MEAN THAT. I KNOW. THANK YOU. SO, I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY DROPPED THE REYES CASE. YEAH. SO ENDS MY UNINTERRUPTED ASCENT UP THE PROSECUTORIAL LADDER. IT WAS A GREAT WEEK. GIARDELLA GETS WASTED, AND OUR OTHER CHIEF WITNESS DEVELOPS MEMORY‐LAPSE. WHO DO YOU THINK GOT TO PEREZ? PROBABLY KIDNAPPED SOME RELATIVE IN LIMA. THE TRUTH IS, OUTSIDE THE D. A.'S OFFICE, NO ONE CARES ABOUT THESE GUYS ANYWAY, LAURA. READ THE PAPERS. "THREE COLOMBIANS." "FOUR DEAD COKE MULES FROM PERU." THEY GOT NO FACES. GIARDELLA HAD US IN THE GAME, STUFF HE WAS GIVIN' US. YOU GET TO PROSECUTE A GUY LIKE TOMMY LINARDI, THAT'S PROFILE, THAT'S GOT SOME FUTURE. IT'S TOO BAD GIARDELLA'S DEAD. YEAH. HOW LONG WERE YOU ALONE WITH HIM... BEFORE HE DIED? UH... TILL THE MARSHAL CAME IN. HOW LONG? MAYBE 15 SECONDS. THE MARSHAL WAS DOWN THE HALLWAY. HE WAS CHECKING THE MAID'S CLEANING CART. YOU WERE ALONE WITH GIARDELLA 15 SECONDS AFTER HE WAS SHOT? YEAH. WHY, JIMMY? 'CAUSE IF HE SPOKE TO YOU AS HE WAS DYING, IF HE ACCUSED HIS KILLER, THAT'S AN EXCLUSION TO THE HEARSAY RULE. THAT'D BE ADMISSIBLE IN COURT. EXCEPT GIARDELLA DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. HE CRAWLED TO THE DOOR, HE REACHED HIS HAND OUT TO ME AND THEN HE DIED. LAURA, WE KNOW WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT MURDER. "IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME, LINARDI GAVE THE ORDER." HOW MANY TIMES DID GIARDELLA TELL US THAT? HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE THAT ON TAPE? BUT IT'S NOT ADMISSIBLE. A DYING ACCUSATION... IS. GIARDELLA DIDN'T ACCUSE ANYONE, JIMMY. PEOPLE WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WERE RELUCTANT TO TELL THE POLICE. THERE'D BEEN INDICTMENTS, ALLEGATIONS COPS WERE ON THE MOB PAYROLL. YOU EVEN HESITATED TO TELL ME. IT'S PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE. JIMMY‐‐ LOOK! YOU WERE MARRIED TO A COP SIX YEARS. I HAVE A TOUGH TIME BELIEVING YOUR EX‐HUSBAND NEVER TOLD YOU ABOUT HELPING A CASE. WHEN YOU DIDN'T HAVE A WARRANT, SAYING THE PERP ASKED YOU INTO THE APARTMENT. SAYING HE CAME INTO THE HALL VOLUNTARILY. SAYING YOU DIDN'T BEAT HIM TO MAKE HIM CONFESS. NO, JOHNNY NEVER TALKED TO ME ABOUT THAT. WELL, MAYBE IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEONE PAID YOU THE COMPLIMENT... OF TREATING YOU LIKE AN ADULT. OBVIOUSLY IT'S YOUR DECISION.

GET HER SOME CLOTHES. CALL IN UNIFORM AND SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN. COME ON, ASSHOLE. LET'S GO. MY LAWYER'S GONNA HAVE A BALL WITH THIS. WHO'S THIS? I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE. I'M DETECTIVE ROBERTS. I'M INVESTIGATING A CAB ROBBERY LAST OCTOBER THE 24TH. THE DRIVER WAS ROBBED, THEN HIS CAB WAS TAKEN... AND ABANDONED ON THE 700 BLOCK OF FLETCHER. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT? I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE. I THOUGHT SO TOO. BUT THEN DETECTIVE ROBERTS HERE SHOWS ME THIS NEW CAB ROBBERY FILE. WHAT'S GOIN' ON, LUIS? THIS IS YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT. THAT AIN'T ME. IT'S THE SAME CAB COMPANY, SAME PICKUP AREA. NO, MAN. I AIN'T GOIN' FOR THIS. I THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL. THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK, LUIS, UNLESS YOU ARE TOTALLY CANDID WITH ME. I ASKED YOU ABOUT ALL THE CAB ROBBERY FILES, AND NOW I'M LOOKIN' THROUGH NEW ONES. LOOK THROUGH ALL THE FILES YOU WANT. I DIDN'T DO THIS ONE. THIS IS DEFINITELY YOU. TAKE A LOOK AT IT. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY YOU. [ SIGHS ] HEY, LUIS, I'M TRYIN' TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE. YOU THINK I SHOULD HAVE A LAWYER IN HERE NOW? THAT'S YOUR CALL. IF YOU WANT AN ATTORNEY IN HERE, I'LL GET YOU AN ATTORNEY IN HERE. HE'S GONNA TELL YOU TO SHUT UP. AND THEN THINGS WILL BECOME ADVERSARIAL. THE DEAL'S GONE. FORGET THE DEAL. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? US AGAINST YOU? KNOWIN' WHAT I KNOW ABOUT YOU? YOU WANT ME AGAINST YOU? I DON'T THINK SO. I WANT A CIGARETTE. YOU WANT AN ATTORNEY PRESENT? NO, I JUST WANT A CIGARETTE. [ SIGHS ] OKAY. GET THE MAN A CIGARETTE. GET HIM A FEW. [ CHATTERING ] HEY. HI, JIMMY. [ SIGHS ] YOU'RE ABOUT TO DRIVE ME BACK TO SMOKING. DON'T. I DON'T NEED THAT ON MY CONSCIENCE. YEAH, I'M HAVING A FEW PROBLEMS IN THAT AREA MYSELF. LOOK, I HOPE YOU DIDN'T GET THE WRONG IMPRESSION FROM OUR CONVERSATION THIS MORNING. NO, I DIDN'T GET THE WRONG IMPRESSION. YOU CAN SAY THAT IT'S ONLY TO HELP A CASE WE'RE SURE ABOUT. WE KNOW LINARDI KILLED GIARDELLA. UNDERNEATH ALL THE PARTY WRAPPING, YOU'RE STILL ASKING ME TO LIE. [ CAR HORN HONKING ] YOU WOULDN'T BE TAPING THIS BY ANY CHANCE, WOULD YOU, LAURA? NO, I'M NOT TAPING THIS. ‐ WANNA SEARCH ME? ‐ SORRY. I HAVEN'T SAID THAT I WOULDN'T BE WILLING TO HELP YOU. BUT I NEED TO KNOW THE TERMS. WELL, IF YOU WERE TO REMEMBER THAT BEFORE HE DIED GIARDELLA ACCUSED LINARDI, OR THE SHOOTER MENTIONED LINARDI'S NAME, THAT'D GET US THROUGH GRAND JURY. WE'D EXPLAIN YOU HELD BACK 'CAUSE YOU WERE FRIGHTENED, YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST WITH THE TRUTH. ONCE THE GRAND JURY INDICTS, WE'D HAVE SUBPOENA POWER. WE COULD ALSO USE OUR TAPED CONVERSATIONS WITH GIARDELLA. WE'D BE BACK IN BUSINESS, LAURA. TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T COOPERATE. ‐ WE'RE FRIENDS. WE'D FIND A WAY TO WORK IT OUT. ‐ TELL ME HOW. WELL, IF YOU WERE MORE COMFORTABLE NOT WORKING FOR ME ANYMORE, THAT'D BE OKAY. I MEAN, I KNOW IT MIGHT LOOK KIND OF AWKWARD 'CAUSE YOU CHANGED JOBS SO RECENTLY. ‐ YES, IT WOULD. ‐ IT'D LOOK LIKE LAURA'S "JOB OF THE MONTH" CLUB. YOU DON'T WANNA GIVE PEOPLE THE IMPRESSION OF INSTABILITY. LET ME SEE IF I GET THE PICTURE HERE. IF I WANT TO STAY, I HAVE TO REMEMBER... GIARDELLA ACCUSED LINARDI BEFORE HE DIED, EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THAT'S A LIE. OTHERWISE, YOU'LL HAVE ME TRANSFERRED FROM MY JOB AND SPREAD RUMORS THAT I'M UNSTABLE. YOU'RE PUTTING THINGS IN A PRETTY HARSH LIGHT. BUT ACCURATE. YOU LOST ONE CASE. DO YOU REALLY NEED TO SUCCEED THAT MUCH? WHAT I DON'T NEED IS PSYCHOANALYSIS FROM YOU. OKAY. FOOD FOR THOUGHT. WHICH IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR ACTUAL LUNCH. COME ON. NO, THANKS. I NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT. LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU DECIDE. I HATE WHAT I'M DOING. I HATE THIS. I WANT TO STOP. YEAH, WELL, MY EXPERIENCE IS, THE FEELING WILL PASS AS SOON AS YOU MAKE BAIL. YOU WANNA SIT DOWN OVER HERE? DO YOU KNOW WHY I STARTED WORKING AT THE CLUB? UH, TO PAY FOR COLLEGE? [ SIGHS ] HAPPENS TO BE THE TRUTH. YOU KNOW, AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GONNA BE FOR A WHILE, BUT‐‐ [ SIGHS ] WOULD IT KILL YOU TO BELIEVE ME, TO GIVE ME A BREAK? LOOK, MONIQUE, I GOT NO BEEF WITH YOU. BUT IF I LET YOU WALK, YOUR BOSS WALKS TOO. THINK OF YOURSELF AS, UH, THE FRIENDLY DOLPHIN GOT CAUGHT IN THE SHARK NET, HUH? CURRENT ADDRESS? 700 WEST 29TH. HOW ABOUT IF I HELP YOU NAIL FRANKIE? I'D SAY HOORAY, MONIQUE. BUT WOULDN'T YOU BE BUYIN' YOURSELF SOME GRIEF? DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, DOES IT? JUST TO BEAT A $200 FINE? MAYBE I REALLY DO WANT TO GET OUT, HUH, DETECTIVE? YEAH, MAYBE YOU DO. ALL RIGHT, BALL'S IN YOUR COURT. WE'RE A CASH BUSINESS. ‐ DO YOU THINK HE DECLARES ALL THAT CASH? ‐ PROBABLY NOT. I KNOW WHERE HIS SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES ARE. I CAN TELL YOU THE BANKS. SURPRISE, SURPRISE, HUH, DETECTIVE? LET'S GET IT RIGHT. I TOLD YOU, I ONLY DID THE FOUR. LUIS, DID WE OR DID WE NOT HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW GOOD YOU WERE DOIN' FOR YOURSELF? THE FOUR CRIMES COMBINED, THE POSITIVE RECOMMENDATION? REMEMBER YOUR WHOLE SUPPORT SYSTEM? DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? BYE‐BYE. ALL THE DETAILS YOU GAVE US ON THE FIRST FOUR, LUIS, THEY PUT YOU RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS THING. HEY, YOU ARE TAKING YOUR CHANCES ON THIS ONE, BUDDY, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE IF I HAVE TO POP YOU ON THIS, THIS IS A WHOLE SEPARATE DEAL. THIS IS A WHOLE NEW TRIAL. MORE TIME. PUT 'EM TOGETHER. I DIDN'T DO THAT ONE. OKAY. I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME, OKAY? YOU GOT THE ONE ROBBERY. YOU PUT IT WITH THE OTHER FOUR, AND THEN YOU HAVE AN UMBRELLA UNDER WHICH TO PLACE ALL THE FIVE CRIMES. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NO ADDITIONAL TIME, NO NEW CHARGES. COPS ARE JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE. YOU MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR US, WE'LL MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR YOU. THAT'S IT. [ KELLY ] YOU HEAR ABOUT PRISON OVERCROWDING? ANYTHING UNDER FIVE YEARS, THEY'RE LOOKIN' FOR AN EXCUSE TO SEND YOU HOME. ANYTHING OVER, THEY'RE GONNA FIND A PLACE FOR YOU. SO PUT 'EM TOGETHER. OKAY, LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T COOPERATE, LUIS. MY LIEUTENANT IS GONNA HAVE ME LOOK INTO ALL THE CAB ROBBERIES IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS. AND GUESS WHO DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA WANT ME TO CONNECT THEM TO? WHO DO YOU THINK? HUH? IT'S GONNA TAKE ME THREE OR FOUR DAYS, BUT I'LL DO IT. NO, THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE. LUIS, YOU'RE PROBABLY FEELING LIKE YOU'RE BEING JERKED AROUND, AND I'M PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE. I SHOULD'VE LOOKED INTO MORE FILES BEFORE WE TALKED. SO I'M GONNA MAKE IT UP TO YOU. I'M GONNA SWEETEN THE POT A LITTLE, OKAY? RIGHT. TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE CRIMES YOU COMMITTED. [ EXHALES ] BAD. I FEEL BAD. AND SITTIN' HERE, HEARIN' YOU SAY THAT, I BELIEVE YOU ARE SINCERE. SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS, WHEN YOU MAKE THE SECOND CONFESSION ON TAPE, AT THE END OF THE TAPE, I'M GONNA ALLOW YOU... TO MAKE A STATEMENT OF REMORSE TO THE JUDGE. THAT'S IMPORTANT, LUIS. THEY WANT REMORSE. YOU GOT MONEY PROBLEMS. YOU'RE DESPERATE FOR MONEY. YOU CAN'T MAKE YOUR RENT. RIGHT? THAT MAKE SENSE? THINK ABOUT IT. [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ] [ WILLIAMS ] SO, AFTER YOU BOUND THE DRIVER'S WRISTS WITH DUCT TAPE... AND MADE HIM LEAVE THE CAB, THEN WHAT DID YOU DO? I DROVE THE CAB TO 24TH STREET... 'CAUSE I KNEW THERE WAS A SUBWAY STOP NEAR THERE. I COUNTED THE MONEY. THERE WAS, UM, 55‐‐ NO, 58 DOLLARS. AND THEN I JUST LEFT THE CAB. YOU TOOK THE SUBWAY HOME? YEAH. NOW? YEAH, GO AHEAD. I JUST WANNA SAY I'M VERY SORRY FOR DOIN' THESE ROBBERIES. I KNOW THAT THEY WERE WRONG. I DIDN'T USE THE MONEY FOR DRUGS OR ANY ILLEGAL THINGS. THESE ARE THE ONLY CRIMES I'VE EVER DONE. YOU'RE THE MAN. NICE JOB. [ WILLIAMS CLEARS THROAT ] [ OFFICER ] HURRY IT UP DOWN THERE. DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ. YEAH. I DON'T CARE IF YOU EMBARRASS YOURSELF, BUT DON'T EMBARRASS ME. EXCUSE ME, COUNSELOR. I, UH‐‐ I'M NOT SURE I'M TAKING YOUR DRIFT. I'VE JUST COME FROM AN INTERVIEW WITH YOUR ARRESTEE, FRANK CANTOR, WHOSE TWO FAVORITE WORDS IN REGARD TO YOU ARE "ASSHOLE" AND "ENTRAPMENT." WHAT EXACTLY DID HE SAY? FOR OPENERS? THAT YOU SOLICITED A SEX ACT FROM ONE OF HIS EMPLOYEES. THAT YOU TOOK HER INTO A BACK ROOM, OFFERED TO PAY HER $100, AND NEVER IDENTIFIED YOURSELF AS A POLICE OFFICER... UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD "TAKEN HER FOR A TEST DRIVE AROUND THE BLOCK." FIRST OF ALL, A. D. A. COSTAS, THAT WAS A STRAIGHT‐UP, BY‐THE‐NUMBERS BUST. WHICH, NEVER MIND SECOND OF ALL, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THIS CONCEPT... OF YOU AND I ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A TEAM HERE? WHY IN THE HELL WOULD YOU TAKE THE WORD OF SOME SCUMBAG LIKE FRANKIE CANTOR OVER MINE? YOU HAVEN'T BANKED A LOT OF CREDIBILITY WITH ME, DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ. THIS WOULD BE WITH REGARD TO YOU HAVING TO PROSECUTE THAT THING WITH GIARDELLA'S CIGARETTES? AND HAVING YOU AS MY SOLE WITNESS. I DON'T DRINK ANYMORE. WATCHING YOU STUMBLE THROUGH TESTIMONY, NOT TO MENTION GRABBING YOUR CROTCH AND CALLING ME A PISSY LITTLE BITCH. I APOLOGIZE FOR MY BAD BEHAVIOR. ALL'S I'M ASKIN', BEFORE YOU KICK THIS CASE‐‐ HOW ABOUT YOU INTERVIEW THAT DANCER MONIQUE? I AM GOING TO INTERVIEW HER, DETECTIVE. AND IF SHE TELLS ME THAT YOU GOT YOUR ROCKS OFF, I'M DROPPING THE CHARGES.

I TOLD HIM TO PULL INTO THE ALLEY AND TO GIVE ME THE MONEY. BUT HE WOULDN'T DO IT. SO I POINTED THE GUN AT HIM, AND I TRIED TAPING HIS WRISTS SO I'D BE ABLE TO TAKE THE MONEY. BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE TRIES TO GRAB THE GUN. I MEAN, I WAS JUST TRYIN' TO SCARE HIM. BUT WHEN HE WAS GRABBIN' THE GUN, THERE WAS NOTHIN' ELSE THAT I COULD DO. SO YOU SHOT HIM. YEAH, BUT HE DIDN'T GIVE ME NO CHOICE, MAN. OKAY, LUIS. OKAY. NOW I'M GONNA ASK THOSE PEOPLE TO COME BACK IN HERE. AND I'M WARNING YOU, I'D BETTER NOT HAVE TO SEND THEM OUT AGAIN.

[ CLEARS THROAT ] SORRY. I SWEAT WHEN I EAT. YOU REMIND ME OF MY FATHER. IS THAT A PLUS OR A MINUS? PLUS. HE'S A... ENTHUSIASTIC EATER TOO. HE HAS FOUR BROTHERS. THEY COME OVER EVERY SUNDAY, AND THEY EAT A TON AND THEY DRINK EVEN MORE. AND THEY END UP IN FISTFIGHTS WITH EACH OTHER, AND THEY THINK IT'S FUN. OH, YEAH, WHEN I WAS DRINKIN', IT WILL CHANGE YOUR IDEA ABOUT FUN. OH, DON'T GET THE WRONG IDEA. THAT'S NOT ALL MY DAD. IN FACT, HE'S THE KINDEST, MOST DECENT MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN. HE TOOK A SECOND JOB TO PAY MY TUITION AT ST. JOHN'S. SAID HE WANTED ME TO BE ABLE TO CONCENTRATE ON MY STUDIES. AND WHEN I GRADUATED, HE WAS SO PROUD. HE SAT RIGHT IN THE FRONT ROW, WITH ALL MY UNCLES. THEY WERE ALL WEARING THESE GIGANTIC RED CARNATIONS. AND WHEN I WALKED BY, THEY WERE ALL SHOUTING, "THERE SHE IS! THERE'S OUR SYLVIA!" SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD MAN. [ CLEARS THROAT ] AND HE SWEATS WHEN HE EATS. YEP. [ CLEARS THROAT ] I, UH‐‐ I LIKE FISH. HOW COME YOU ORDERED STEAK? [ CHUCKLES ] NO.

I WANTED TO ASK YOU, WHEN YOU SENT ME OUTSIDE, YOU GAVE ME YOUR GUN AND SO FORTH, UH‐‐ I WANTED TO ASK YOU WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE, WHY THE GUY GAVE IT UP. YOU MEAN, DID I BEAT IT OUT OF HIM? YEAH. IF THAT'S WHY HE CONFESSED. I DIDN'T BEAT HIM. THEN WHY'D HE GIVE IT UP? BECAUSE HE'S GUILTY, AND HE KNEW I WAS WILLING TO BEAT IT OUT OF HIM TO GET THE TRUTH. SO IF IT CAME TO IT, YOU WOULD'VE BEATEN HIM? LET ME PUT IT TO YOU LIKE THIS. I NEVER RAISE MY HAND TO A GUY... IF I THINK HE'S GUILTY OR I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT IF HE'S GUILTY. BUT IF I'M SURE HE'S GUILTY AND THE CASE IS GONNA WALK UNLESS I RAISE MY HAND, I DO WHAT I GOTTA DO. EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE BREAKIN' THE LAW? OKAY, YOU'RE ASKIN' ME IF I BELIEVE IN THE CONSTITUTION. YES, I BELIEVE IN THE CONSTITUTION, AND I HANG ON TO THAT AS LONG AS I CAN. BUT IN THE CASE OF A MURDERER LIKE THIS, WHO'S GONNA WALK, I LEAVE MY GUN AND MY JEWELRY OUTSIDE, ALONG WITH THE CONSTITUTION. AND IF YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THIS GUY? WELL, THEN GOD FORGIVE ME. IF YOU, IF YOU WANT, I CAN MAKE SOMETHIN' UP PRETTIER THAN THAT, JAMES. BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. OKAY. NIGHT. NIGHT. OpenSubtitles recommends to be fit Reshape Weight Loss App: osdb.link/fit
