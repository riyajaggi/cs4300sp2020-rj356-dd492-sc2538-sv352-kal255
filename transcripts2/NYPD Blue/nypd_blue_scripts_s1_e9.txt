A NEIGHBORHOOD KID. I GREW UP WITH HIM. HE SAID HE WAS OVER ON 6TH STREET, AND MY FATHER FOUND HIM AND BEAT HIM UP, SAYING, "WHO SOLD DRUGS TO ROBERTO?"

HOW ARE WE GONNA ARREST THAT DRUG DEALER, POPPY? HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY DRUGS ON HIM, AND WE CAN'T PROVE HE SOLD DRUGS TO ROBERTO.

HECTOR MARTINEZ. YOUR HONOR, DEFENDANT IS CHARGED WITH POSSESSION OF A CONCEALED WEAPON. BUT AFTER DISCUSSION WITH THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THE CASE... AND CONSIDERING THE OVERALL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE, THE STATE WOULD NOT OBJECT... OF AN R. O. R. AND OF ADJOURNMENT CONTEMPLATING DISMISSAL. ‐ WE WOULD ACCEPT, YOUR HONOR. ‐ THE GUN WAS DISCHARGED? [ COSTAS ] YOU'LL NOTE IN THE ARRESTING OFFICER'S REPORT THAT IT WAS AN OFFICER... WHO CAUSED THE GUN TO FIRE IN THE PROCESS OF DISARMING THE SUSPECT. [ JUDGE ] AHA. [ COSTAS ] WE'D LIKE TO POINT OUT... THAT THE DEFENDANT HAS NO PRIOR RECORD AND STRONG ROOTS IN THE COMMUNITY, YOUR HONOR, AND HIS OLDEST SON IS A POLICE OFFICER. YOU'LL ALSO NOTE THAT THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED IN THE AFTERMATH... OF THE DEFENDANT LEARNING OF THE DEATH OF HIS YOUNGER SON. MR. MARTINEZ, I'M GOING TO RELEASE YOU WITHOUT BOND... AND IF YOU STAY OUT OF TROUBLE FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS... THIS INCIDENT WILL NOT APPEAR ON YOUR RECORD. DO YOU HEAR ME, SIR? ALL RIGHT. YES. CONDOLENCES ON YOUR LOSS. MR. MARTINEZ, YOU GOT A MINUTE FOR ME? WHAT DO YOU WANT? STEP OUTSIDE. HI.

I THINK YOU'D BE BETTER OFF CHECKING THE RESERVATIONS LIST AT DUBROVNIK'S, 8:00 TONIGHT. WELL, YOU ARE THE DETECTIVE. YEAH. OKAY. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION, THEN. HOW MUCH MORE DAMAGE YOU GOING TO DO TO YOUR FAMILY BECAUSE ROBERTO DIED? WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT? YOU LEAVE THE DEALER ON THE STREET AND YOU ARREST ME. THERE WAS NO WAY FOR US TO CHARGE THAT DEALER. WE BROUGHT YOU IN... BECAUSE WE WERE AFRAID YOU WERE GONNA DO SOMETHING STUPID. MR. MARTINEZ, WANT TO WIND UP HAVING YOUR WIFE VISIT YOU FOR FIVE YEARS ON RIKER'S ISLAND? TWO HOURS A WEEK FOR FIVE YEARS SEEING YOU... WITH THE JUNKIES AND THE PIMPS AND THE THIEVES. AND WHAT'S REALLY BAD IS HER KNOWING YOU BELONG THERE BECAUSE YOU THREW YOUR FAMILY AWAY. SOME LOWLIFE KILLED MY SON. DRUGS KILLED YOUR SON. ROBERTO PUT THAT SPIKE IN HIS ARM ALL BY HIMSELF, AND HE'S GONE NOW. FOR YOU TO GO SHOOT THE GUY WHO SOLD HIM THE DRUGS IS NOT GONNA CHANGE THAT. MEANWHILE, YOU GOT ANOTHER SON TRYING TO HELP YOU, AND ALL YOU DO IS SLAP AND INSULT HIM. JAMES LOVES YOU. YOU DON'T NEED TO TELL ME ABOUT MY SON. LISTEN TO ME. JAMES IS A GOOD PERSON. I DON'T KNOW YOUR WIFE, BUT AFTER SEEING JAMES, I CAN TELL SHE'S A GOOD PERSON JUST LIKE YOU. NOW, YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB WITH YOUR KIDS. YOU'VE HAD A HORRIBLE LOSS. GET PAST IT AND PUT YOUR FAMILY BACK TOGETHER. WE ARE DONE RUNNING AROUND LIKE A BUNCH OF SCHMUCKS... MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS OKAY FOR YOU, MR. MARTINEZ.

THE ICE CAPADES WERE THE COOLEST. BEAUTIFUL, PERFECT PEOPLE ZOOMING ACROSS THE ICE. YEAH? HOW DID YOU GET FROM THE ICE CAPADES TO LIKING HOCKEY SO MUCH? I GUESS THAT HAD MORE TO DO WITH THE PLAYERS.

ARE YOU GONNA BE LATE GETTING HOME? I AM GONNA BE SO LATE. BUT YOU GOT TO BE LATE ALL THE TIME, WORKING ON CASES. YEAH. THEN I CAN BE HOME LATE. OH‐‐ THIS WAS A GREAT NIGHT FOR ME. ME TOO. COME ON. I'LL WALK YOU TO YOUR CAR. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WHAT'S WRONG? IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE IN BED WITH US. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG. THAT'S A WEIRD THING TO SAY. IT'S A WEIRD FEELING. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU? I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL LIKE I'M BEING REVIEWED ON THE WAY I MAKE LOVE. MM‐MM. THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GET OUT OF HERE, JOHNNY? WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID WOULD HAPPEN IF I STAYED? OH, DON'T INTERROGATE ME. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU? YOU WANT ME TO TRUST YOU, AND I'M TRYING. BUT DIDN'T I SEE YOU GET ANOTHER PHONE CALL TODAY? HMM?

I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS AGAIN. OKAY. I WANT TO SEE THIS ASSHOLE. WHO? ‐ RICHIE. I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. ‐ NO. THEN YOU'D BE INVOLVED. ‐ JANICE, I AM INVOLVED. ‐ JOHNNY, I WANT YOU TO GO GET YOUR CLOTHES. ‐ I WANT YOU TO CALL HIM. ‐ NO. I WANT YOU TO GO GET YOUR CLOTHES, GO AWAY... AND LET ME FIGURE OUT HOW I'M GONNA DEAL WITH THIS. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T TELL YOU THE TRUTH. SO NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME THE TRUTH, BUT YOU WON'T LET ME HELP YOU. "WE COULD HAVE A LIFE," RIGHT? ‐ JANICE, DON'T GET IN BED WITH THESE PEOPLE AGAIN. ‐ I WON'T. OFFICER LICALSI. GOOD MORNING, INSPECTOR. SECURITY TELLS ME YOU LOGGED INTO THE BUILDING AT 6:30. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH CHAIN OF COMMAND. NO? LEMON CHEESE DANISH. YOU WANT SOME? IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO GET DOWN TO WHAT I CAME HERE FOR. I'M GLAD HE'S DEAD‐‐ ANGELO MARINO AND HIS DRIVER. THEY CHOOSE THEIR WORK, THESE PEOPLE, AND WHATEVER HAPPENS TO THEM, I CAN LIVE WITH THAT. OFFICER LICALSI‐‐ I KNEW THE SON OF A BITCH PERSONALLY‐‐ MARINO. YOU EVER MEET HIM OR HEAR HIS VOICE ON TAPE, MAYBE? YOU'RE IMPLYING YOU HAD COMMUNICATIONS WITH MARINO PRIOR TO HIS DEATH? PRIOR TO HIS DEATH, YEAH. NOTHING SINCE. I DON'T THINK YOU'VE FOUND THE TONE YOU WANT TO TAKE WITH ME YET. PROBABLY NOT. BUT I GAVE THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT BEFORE I CAME IN HERE. AND I GAVE A LOT OF THOUGHT TO ANGELO MARINO TOO‐‐ MORE THAN HE DESERVES, REALLY. MOST COURTS WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM JUST WHAT HE GOT AND KEPT HIM AROUND... IN JAIL FOR TEN YEARS BEFOREHAND WHILE HE BLED APPEALS. OFFICER LICALSI, LET'S ESTABLISH SOME GROUND RULES FOR THIS DISCUSSION. THE MATTER OF THE DEATH OF ANGELO MARINO IS CLOSED. IT IS A CLEARED CASE. ALFONSE GIARDELLA DID THAT MURDER. ALFONSE GIARDELLA CONFESSED TO THAT MURDER. NOW, YOU MAY THINK YOU HAVE SOME REASON FOR REOPENING THOSE DOORS. I'M TELLING YOU YOU DON'T. HEAR ME ON THIS, OFFICER, 'CAUSE I'M NOT SAYING IT AGAIN. I HEARD YOU. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOU. I'M INTERESTED IN LOOKING FORWARD, NOT BACK. YOU'RE NOT A FOOL. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT JUST FINE. DON'T YOU? SAY I DO. HIS DEATH TO ONE SIDE, THIS SAME MARINO REACHED OUT TO YOU? ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE HE WAS SHOT. HE SAID IN THE FUTURE... THERE'D BE SOMETHING HE WOULD ASK ME TO DO. WHY WOULD HE EXPECT YOU TO COOPERATE? MY DADDY WAS DOMINIC GENNARO, ONE OF THE COPS THAT GOT INDICTED. WHO JUST DIED. MARINO'S BLACKMAILING ME. HE SAID THAT... HE WOULD LET ON THAT MY DAD WAS ON HIS PAYROLL UNLESS I DID WHAT HE WANTED ME TO DO. WHEN THAT TIME CAME, WHAT DID HE ASK YOU TO DO? THE ONLY THING THAT I DID FOR THAT SON OF A BITCH WAS THAT THING... THAT YOU TOLD ME WE ARE NOT GOING TO DISCUSS. OKAY. WHY DID YOU COME HERE TODAY? I WAS APPROACHED AGAIN. BY WHOM? SOME GUY NAMED RICHIE. I DON'T KNOW WHO HE WORKS FOR. TOMMY LINARDI. PROBABLY. I DON'T KNOW. LOOK, I WANT TO GET OUT FROM UNDER. IF THAT MEANS LOSING MY JOB, IF IT MEANS GOING TO JAIL‐‐ WHO ELSE HAVE YOU TOLD ABOUT THIS? NO ONE YET. KEEP IT THAT WAY. IN THE MEANTIME, I'M GONNA NEED SOME TIME TO DIGEST EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAID TODAY. I'LL BE IN TOUCH WHEN I DECIDE HOW TO PROCEED. I'M SUPPOSED TO TALK TO THESE PEOPLE. THEY WANT ME TO RUN A LICENSE PLATE. I'LL BE IN TOUCH VERY SOON. YES, I REMEMBER YOU. I'M GLAD YOU CALLED BACK. MY SUPERIORS AUTHORIZED ME... TO RELEASE SOME CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO YOU. THIS IS ON A TOP‐SECRET BASIS. THEY WANT ME TO LET YOU KNOW... THE GRAVITY SHELF IS IN REMISSION. THE LASER DEATH TEAM GOT RECALLED. WELL, IF THE DEATH TEAM DISOBEYS ORDERS... FROM SHELF HEADQUARTERS‐‐ ALUMINUM FOIL. IN THE SMALL EVENT THAT OCCURS, JUST CRUMPLE TWO PIECES OF ALUMINUM FOIL... AND STUFF THEM IN YOUR UNDERSHORTS. IT DEFEATS THEIR SENSOR RAYS. DEFINITELY. THIS COULD COLLAPSE... THE EMPIRE OF THE GRAVITY SHELF. YES. THESE ARE GREAT DAYS. OKAY. GOOD‐BYE. YOU SAVED THE GALAXY. HEY, ROBERTS, YOU OWE 14 BUCKS...
