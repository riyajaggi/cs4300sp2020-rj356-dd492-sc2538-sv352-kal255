 Rachel, my God! You get younger every time I see you. Oh, shut up! Mmm, nice. Always the best for you, darling. Um, I'm sorry. I should've told you on the phone when we set up the appointment. My fee has gone up. Well, after all this time, you should know you're worth every penny. I want to see you.

 Yes. Show yourself. Yes. Harold, make yourself known. Rachel's here. She wants to talk to you. He's here. He wants you to know he thinks the new haircut is hot. Thirty-two years we're married. Now that you're dead, you like it short. Harold says he was stupid. He hated change. God, Harold. Not a day goes by I don't miss you something awful. He doesn't want you to grieve him forever.

 He wants you to be happy. I... I need to tell you something. I'm seeing someone. He's listening. Go on. We're taking it slow, but... I'm happy. He wants to know who it is. It's Kevin. Well, perhaps we should take a break. Or just stop altogether. No. You are not to cross. What's wrong? Stay back. You stay back. My partner? My friend? Harold? You had to go there? Since when? Did you wait till I... No, it's nothing like that! What's it like then? Does he like your hair like that? No! Get out of my body, Harold. Sit! Oh! No! You can be with me. We can be together again! I'm not gonna let you hurt her! I'd rather end it! You don't get another go-around, Harold. Get the hell out now! Well, I guess Harold still hates change. You can't run from me, Manfred. I'm not running. I'm paying you back. I just need time. Too late. I will find you. Gotta go. Hey, Grandma. You look terrible. Look who's talking. Don't tell me. Another hijacking? Only a second. I ended it quick. Couple of pills, headache's gone. This move will be good for you. You need to settle down. You need a home. I need to disappear. I can't think of a place better to disappear to. You'll be safe in Midnight. That'd mean a whole lot more coming from someone who wasn't dead. Mr. Snuggly, just wait a minute. I'm almost done. A musician. Pawning a trumpet? That's it. You nailed it. Don't cry. It won't be long. I don't want to die. You'll be an angel up in Heaven with God. We cast you out, every unclean spirit... - Every legion! - Wonders... My own children leave me here to rot! Go to hell! Company pull! Attack! Hey. You must be Manfred. You made good time from Dallas. No traffic the last five hours. No, there isn't. I'll show you your new home. Come on. The last tenant left the furniture. If particle board bothers you, you're welcome to come by the shop. It's fine. I like newer things. RV out front suggests otherwise. Hey, I gotta come clean, man. I checked you out before renting the house. I hope it's not a problem. That you're a psychic? No, just the opposite. I was gonna offer you a month's free rent if you could help me out. My fiancée, well... Aubrey, she walked out. And she's not returning my calls... Let me stop you. It's... It's not real. I tell people what they want to hear. I'm just really good at reading people. That's all it is. Well, no harm in asking. You got the place for a month. You need it any longer... I know where to find you. Thanks. Mmm-hmm. Does this look like a Walmart? No. I don't provide crayons. Amuse your own children. I'd like to place an order to go. You're Manfred. Bobo said he had a new tenant. I saw your RV, nice ride. I know. Real chick magnet. I'm Creek. I live behind the Gas & Go with my dad and little brother, Connor. Cool. Follow me. Where? The Midnighter's Room. It's where we sit. Except the Rev. He eats alone. Now that you live here, you eat with us. So if Midnighters eat there then... The rest of the folks are ranchers, folks from Davy. Well, I don't want to bother. You're not. It's usually more crowded. Folks are getting ready for tomorrow. It's the Annual Fall Picnic. You should come. Well, if you'll be there. You meet your neighbors yet? Sort of. You're the non-musician. That's Olivia. Lemuel Bridger. You eat beef? Wouldn't have moved to Texas if I didn't. Do you trust me? No. But I'll let you pick out my dinner. You'll like it. I promise. Don't let her father see you looking at her like that. I didn't mean any offense. If I'm interrupting... You're not. I live under the pawn shop, work the night shift. That's very nice. He's hot. And he's real interesting. He's interesting because he's here. No family, no friends. He's running from something. Then he'll fit in just fine. Apologies. For what? It's been a while since I've eaten. I'm weak, and I was worried. They look like they could be trouble, so I leeched energy. Leeched? What are you exactly? Vampire's one word for it. Seriously? Holy... What the hell? I'm beginning to take offense. Frankly, I'm less frightening than those sons of Lucifer. Here. You'll feel better. Told you. What's so funny? Usually I'm the freak in the room. So, none of this neck thing? Oh, that's always on the menu. Madonna's pot roast special. See, I told you you'd like it. If you want, I could stop by your place tomorrow and we could go to the picnic. I'm not sure. I had a big day of driving... I'm spent. You'll feel better in the morning. I'll have to miss it, but you should go. Midnight is very different in daylight. Fiji, why don't you jump him already? That's not what I was thinking. Yeah, I know what you were thinking. I was admiring his cooking techniques. And don't make that dirty. Why did she bring the new guy? 'Cause she's lonely. Don't worry. I made him cookies. Sand tarts. If he had bad intentions, he'd be tossing those cookies as we speak. Did you poison our new neighbor? It's not poison if he doesn't have poisonous intentions. Rasta! What is that stupid dog going on about? Rasta! Quiet. Rasta, what is it? So you want me to get you something? Oh, we'll come meet you in a second. So what do you think? You happy you came? Yeah, you were right to get me out. Gives me a new perspective on... Fiji! What's wrong? It's okay. I need to report a body. She's in the river. No, she's definitely dead. She's all bloated. No, I know her. That's Aubrey. Aubrey Hamilton. Deputies will be coming by your homes over the next couple days to get your statements. I don't want anybody leaving town without calling the department, getting our permission. Understood? Haven't seen you before. I'm new. Just moved to Midnight. You live here? Heck no. I live in Davy. Work with the Roca Fria County Sheriff's department. Midnight's just in our jurisdiction. Why Midnight? Why would you move here? It's quiet. And cheap. A reason for that. Truth is, I'm surprised this kind of thing hasn't happened before. Kind of thing? Occult murder. The kids in Davy, they dare one another to walk Witch Light Road on full moons. It's got a bit of a ghost town vibe, but people seem nice. Do they? Some folks say she's a witch. Or a lesbian. Could be both. Well, I wouldn't be surprised to find a skin suit in that pawn shop. Her next of kin? Me, I suppose. She's got an aunt. Raised her after her parents died. I don't know her name. So she was gone for two weeks. You didn't report her missing. I thought she walked out. Forgot her stuff. She didn't have much stuff. Couple suitcases of clothes. Why'd she leave? Well, we fought. And... And I got mean. You know, and I told her to get out. But, Sheriff, I didn't intend for that. Poor thing. He better shut up before he says something he can't take back. Even dead, the bitch is trouble. Aubrey, you don't belong here. I didn't give you permission. Go away. Go away! If it means you go away, fine, but my way. Precautions in place. Bobo Winthrop, I love you. Well, I'm here with my beautiful girlfriend and I was hoping that you would do me the honor of becoming my wife. Aubrey, marry me. Yes, I'll marry you! Yes? Yes, I'll be your wife! Yes! She said yes! Look, look! It's so beautiful. Honey, you are the most beautiful girl I have ever laid eyes on and thank you for making an honest man of me. Oh, fits perfectly. All righty. I love it! I brought you breakfast. I can't eat. How about I keep you company then? We don't have to talk. I'll just sit here. That'd be nice. Taking holy water? Yeah. Yes, I am. Reverend, I'm... Manfred. I know who you are. Sunday service starts at 8:00, if you're interested. She wanted four kids. Four? I told her she was crazy. But, you know, I'm open to compromise. Of course. We could get a dog. Sheriff Livingston. I need to talk to Bobo. Okay, I'll go. No, could you stay? Yeah. We got the coroner's preliminary report. Single gunshot to the abdomen. But the official cause of death was drowning. Who would do that? Who would hurt her? Aubrey wasn't, who you thought. Her real name, Aubrey Hamilton-Lowry. What are you talking about? That doesn't make any sense. She was engaged to me. She was married five years ago. Sons of Lucifer. So a white supremacist? Name's Peter Lowry. He just got out of Beaumont Federal. Served three years for assault. Let me guess. You can't find him. He's Sons of Lucifer. He's protected. He's got reach. You Midnighters, you like to take care of things yourselves, but in this case, don't. If he shows up here, you call us. Understood. Don't be coy. Stay on that side. What is it you need to tell me? Hey, whoa, whoa, slower. Slower. P. E-C-A. D. O. S. Pecados. A friend of yours? I was wrong. Made a mistake. I don't want to die. No, I called for Aubrey, not the rest of you. You're all unwelcome in my... This is my home. You have no right... Die. I made a mistake! I don't want to die! I didn't see you at the picnic. I don't eat barbecue. Did you know Aubrey Hamilton? Came in and prayed from time to time. But she wanted to talk to God, not me. She was a sweet girl. Even though she pretty much lied to you about everything? Well, what I meant was... I thought she was sweet until I knew she was duplicitous. Well, the crime scene was ritualistic... Animal remains, bones. I thought that was curious. Curious, no. It's wicked and sad. Witchcraft. That's your thing, right? Wicca. Lot of animal sacrifices in that Wicca? Bundy and Dahmer, Son of Sam... All of them started out with critters before they killed people, and not a Wiccan in the bunch. She'd always come in with some Pinterest board. Stripper trendy was her aesthetic. Okay, so when she did come in, did she ever confide in you? Talk about Bobo? You mean, like girl talk? Aubrey didn't talk. She liked how I did her nails. Damn it. Hello again. I need to take your statement, Mr. Bernardo. She didn't approve of our lifestyle. Didn't like the fact that Chuy was Mexican. So it was safe to say that you didn't like the girl? She judged me. I didn't like how that made me feel. So I didn't judge her. The Christian way, right? I just moved here. I have nothing do to with any of this. I'd like to take a look around, if you don't mind. Actually, I do mind. I mind a lot. Why? 'Cause you're acting weird. And you lie to people for a living. I don't. I can prove it. Does "Pecados" mean anything to you? Now, I've heard of departments consulting with psychics. I never put much stock in it. My grandmother did it all the time. I got a Magic 8-Ball. Maybe I should shake it, figure out who stole Levi's Subaru. Hey, we got something! Could your 8-Ball do that? I already have consultations scheduled in Phoenix... Cancel them. You're part of this investigation. Don't leave town. You said I'd be safe. Well, I thought you'd lay low, not conjure up angry ghosts. I conjured one ghost. Not a crowd of 'em. Certainly not whatever that was under that floor. Midnight's not the same as most places. Which is why I need to get the hell out as soon as... Possible. Olivia. You okay? I heard voices. You did. Me. On the phone. So, I'm surprised. I thought you were avoiding me. I was. Till now. Coming. It's late. I know. I'm sorry. I'm worried... What was that? Olivia, deal with your anger issues. Ugh! Help me get him up. Why exactly is he naked? I was checking for wires, GPS trackers. We live such different lives. This is unexpected. Oh, now that you're done sleeping in, how 'bout some help? Looks like I'm just in time for the fun. Hundreds of Podunk towns in Texas. Why ours? Luck, I suppose. Do you work for the police or a law enforcement agency? Were you sent here to find someone? Did my dad send you? Your dad? No! I'm getting bored and hungry. Okeydoke, this could go sideways real fast. I don't want that. You don't want that. I'm good either way. I'm here 'cause my grandma got a feeling. A psychic feeling that I'd be safe here. Her reads are usually spot-on but Xylda's also a pathological liar, so there's that. Xylda? Gypsy Xylda? You know my grandma? I do. How's she doing? Dead. Going on a year now. Throat cancer. After a run-in with someone who tried to kill me, Xylda said I should hide here. Who are you hiding from, and why do they want you dead? Really wants Xylda dead, but it's too late for that. I guess I'm the only one left to get payback from. Who'd want to hurt Xylda? She ran scams, removed fake hexes, curses, stole and spent more than $2 million. Still doesn't explain why he's so chummy with the sheriff. They showed up my door. I didn't want to give them my secrets. So I gave 'em Aubrey's. I'm done with the questions and getting punched in the face, thank you. So either end it already or let me get dressed. Untie him. He's one of us. Midnight has been a haven for people like us for centuries. Some, like Xylda, stop for a bit and move on. Others, like us, make this home. Wait, everyone here is... What are you? None of your business. Olivia's a friend. Her, Bobo, human, but open-minded. Your grandma wasn't wrong. If you can stand the summers and the neighbors, Midnight is pretty safe. As long as we're quiet, cops and regular folks tolerate us, but... The bitch dying isn't quiet. And with the police and media digging, torches and pitchforks aren't far behind. Question, you said people like us are drawn here. What's so special about this place? Well, Midnight sits on powerful mystical energy. The veil between the living and the dead is awful thin here. Oh. Oh, what? Oh, I get why Xylda liked this place so much. You want me to get some salve for your face? No, I just want to go home. Of course. Apologies for the little misunderstanding. This is usually a quiet and peaceful town. Looking for me? So you killed Aubrey because you found out the truth about her? You're not welcome here. 'Cause we know the truth about you. Where'd you hide the weapons, the money? They don't belong to you. Tell me that... Maybe you live to see sunrise. I think you misjudged the situation. I don't care either way. I didn't ask for your help, man. Well, this isn't just about you anymore. Aubrey is not worth dying for. Now you go on home. It's my shift anyway. You're welcome. Can you deal with that? Sure. I need a word. I'm gonna make you the same offer you gave my friend. If you tell me who sent you, then you get to live to see the sunrise. You want a war, old man, you got one. God forgives. The Sons of Lucifer don't. My brothers are gonna come through and burn this damn place to the ground. It's getting late. No sunrise for you, but a warm dinner for me. Hey. Hey. What in the world happened to you? I wish I had some sexy story to tell. It's just me, a box, and a high shelf. A heavy box, apparently. Very. Haven't seen you since the picnic. You okay? I can't stop thinking about it. That be all for you today? Yep. Take a break, honey. Great. Thanks, Dad. What were you talking to her about? Being neighborly. Pleasantries. That better be all. That'll be $12.50. Hello? I know you're in Texas. You were in Dallas. I'm getting closer. Hey. Hey. I stopped by your house, but... Yeah, lot of flies, bugs. I'll talk to Bobo if I decide to stay. Oh. Well, I just wanted to apologize for before. My dad's weird and I didn't want to get into a thing with him, so if I was cold to you, that's why. Yeah, no apology necessary. We're good. Oh, good. I'm glad we're good. Well, since you came all this way, you want to have a beer? I guess, yeah. I gotta admit, this place is nothing like I thought. Yeah, it's its own thing. Makes for good stories, though. Stories? You a writer? I write, but no. I'm not a writer. Someday, I'll go back to school. Once Connor's out of the house 'cause my dad would be real tough solo. Yeah, that can't be easy for you. He wasn't always like that. After Mom died, he changed. It's why we're here. He didn't want to live anywhere that reminded him of her. Going to high school in Davy sucked. I was known as the chick who lived with freaks. Okay, fine. Not that far off. Doesn't matter. After all this time, they're family. I know what Lem is. He's not the only one with secrets. Like Joe, from the tattoo parlor, he watches over everyone. You can always count on him to help. I wonder what brought him and Chuy to this place. Bobo never talks about family or where he came from, but he's sweet and kind. And you will never meet a more honest person than Bobo. The Rev, I still haven't figured him out. I've seen him pull a gravestone out of the ground with one hand and he's completely obsessed with his pet cemetery. I know Fiji's more than just a New Age cat lady, but she doesn't have a mean bone in her body. Rev's gearing up. Case you didn't notice. I'm busy. Whatever you're doing there, won't do no good. I'm telling ya. Aubrey left a heap of badness in her wake. Rancid smell of burning hair won't change that. Yeah, keep waving them feathers. You can leave now. All right, I'm going over there. And then there's Olivia. She's got more secrets than anyone. I understand it's a lot of money. Well, I still need to pass. Thanks. Just checking. How'd the disposal go? Good. No one will find the body. So, who was on the phone? Job offer. A simple hit. Nice payday. But since I have to call the police every time I want to leave town, I had to say no. You seem angry. That's an understatement. Perhaps I can take some of that from you. I was wondering when you'd ask. Midnight's weird, but it's home. Yeah, never lived in any one place for very long. There. Thanks. Well, you fit in pretty well here. You saying I'm weird? You are. I googled you, Mr. Psychic. It's a family business. I come from a long line of gypsy fortune-tellers. Yeah, you have the caravan to prove it. Yep. So are you for real? Sometimes it's real. Lot of times, it's theater. Do you want to give me a reading? No. Tell me my future? Okay. I'll go old-school. Just give me your hand. Okay. Your life line's long, varied. Will be an interesting life. You're going to see the world. And here, you'll meet your soul mate. You may already have. Someone who... Sees how special you really are. That's the theater part, right? Busted. Well, if you were gonna kiss me, now would be a good time. Bobo Winthrop, you're under arrest for the murder of Aubrey Hamilton-Lowry. I didn't kill her! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say... I did not kill her! ...can and will be used against you in a court of law. No, no! You've the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. Now do you understand these rights as I've explained them to you? It's not my first rodeo and I am telling you, I did not do this. We've got evidence that says otherwise. Back up! Let him go! No! Please! Back off. Everybody, go home. He would never kill her. He loved her! More than she deserved! Look, we have identified the murder weapon. It belonged to him. You've already decided he's guilty. I don't trust you with our friend. Well, I don't trust you either. You don't want to start a war. Clear the road. He's not going anywhere. Neither are we. Go home! Just clear the road! Go home. She's doing this. That's crazy. It's an earthquake or something. I told you she's a witch! There's no such thing as witches, Gomez. Then what is happening? Fiji, not this way. This won't help him. And tomorrow's a full moon. I'll be unavailable for a few days. We have got to be smart about this, Fij. Not angry. I'll help. However I can. And I think I can. Okay. I'ma crank the car. Hurry up. We're gonna get out of here. Hurry up!
