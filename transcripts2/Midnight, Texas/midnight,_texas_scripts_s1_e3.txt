 Previously on Midnight, Texas... The weretiger is me. It's Midnight. You don't need to pretend you're normal. Let your freak flag fly. Xylda said I should hide here. Gypsy Xylda? You know my grandma? Olivia, you seem angry. I can take some of that from you. What are you exactly? Vampires one word for it.

 Supernatural evil is being drawn here. The more that evil takes hold, the more the veil frays. Damn. Just curious... Is this about pissing off your dad? I'd say maybe two percent. I can live with that. I'm really late for dinner. I'm sorry. I hate to "you know" and run, but I-I have to run, all right? Abrupt end to an otherwise pretty good afternoon. Yeah. But, um, one of these days, it'd be nice to do dinner. Yeah, baby steps, all right?

 Have you seen my other earring? Um... It's fine. It's fine. Ah, never mind. I just... I got to go. What happens if you're late? Your dad comes at me with a shotgun? Yeah, that's one possibility. Um... So you and I... This is fun, right? Yeah. Okay, well, for it to stay that way, it means that my dad does not find out. Uh-huh. So we... We hang out, we have a good time, no strings... Is that what you're saying? Yeah, I'm pretty perfect, huh? Yeah. Yeah, you are. So at least let me walk you home. Last time we were out at night didn't go so well. Yeah, but it's not a full moon, and there's no weretiger, so I'm fine. And one overprotective man in my life is plenty. Hello to you, baby doll. What you doing all alone, sweetness? Walking home. And if I'm not there in three minutes, people are gonna come looking for me. Ah, is that so? I'm not scared of you. Oh, really? How about now? Zachariah? Lem. It's been a long time. What happened? Nothing. I'm fine. You don't seem fine. You look scared. I didn't mean to scare anyone. What did you do to her? Uh, everyone, calm down. Lem, you know these folks? Zach's an old friend. Yeah, nice friends. My apologies. We were just having a little fun. If I knew you were a friend of Lem's, I... Everyone in Midnight is a friend. I'm not looking for trouble. Then why are you here? Looking for you. We were passing through on the way to Mazatlan, thought we'd stop for the night. Place brings back memories... When we were all together. That was a long time ago. Too long. I live and work here. Ah, just as dusty and crowded as I remembered it. Eh, it's not as charming as your old bus, but I make do. Hey, don't knock it till you try it. Hey. Olivia, this is Zach, an old friend. Mmm. My pleasure. Vampire. Just like Lem here. No one's like Lem. She's feisty. And off-limits. Zach and I go way back. It's funny, he's never mentioned you. I'm not surprised. The last time we saw each other, we had a little falling out. As I remember, it was more than little. You're right. It cost me my closest friend. I'm asking for a second chance. I'm hoping we can put that bad blood behind us. Speaking of blood... Ground rules? No feeding on Midnighters or anyone in the county, for that matter. And locals are off-limits. I understand. We bring our meals to go. You've turned over a new leaf? Long time ago, you told me you got tired of the hunt. It took me longer to see the light. We don't kill humans to feed anymore. Well, in that case, welcome back to Midnight, brother. My man. So the old hotel's still open? Hotel's been gone a while, but the restaurant's still around. Let's check it out. We'll party like it's 1959. We'll join you there. Okay. Do you trust him? Zach is like a brother to me. You didn't answer the question. He says he's changed. He deserves the benefit of the doubt. Why? Because I owe him my life. Oh! Aah! Don't. If they find you... What will they do to me that they haven't already done? You'll be hanged. I'd rather hang. This is not a life. If there's a way out, I must try. Those are just stories, rumors. Come with me, Abraham. We'll be free. You're far from home, slave. I heard stories about you... That you can offer freedom. I can. But it's gonna cost you. There's no turning back. There's no turning back for me. Either way, I die. In that case... Oh. Mmm, mmm. A nest of vampires dropping in. This an everyday thing? Lem's the only vampire I've ever seen. Me too. Things are getting real weird here. Aubrey and the Sheriff getting killed. And the Rev getting out. Demons under your house. And, uh, vampires. Delightful. Vampires avoid Midnight. Lemuel's an energy leaching vampire. Olivia told me all about how she and Lem... Never mind. Go... go on. Lemuel can kill vampires, which is why they stay away. And Lem and Zach... They seem close. Come on, they're vampires. They kill and feed on people. He's right. Even though Lem vouched for him, we can't let our guard down. They said they'd be gone by sunrise. If anything happens, we'll gather here. The church is sanctuary. FYI, garlic, holy water, them needing to be invited inside... All lies. So how do you kill them? Silver's poison, debilitates them. But to end their lives, it's either sun or a wooden stake through the heart. Awesome. Making themselves at home. Well, this was their home once. Wow. This place is different. I remember the bar was over there, and the piano was in the back. Hey, I... Mm. Olivia, this is Pia. Another old friend? I like her. Lem always had good taste in women. Well, you guys all have a lot of catching up to do. I feel a migraine coming on. You don't have a migraine, do you? You guys have fun. I'll see you later. When they're gone. See you in the morning. Oh, wait, I won't. Olivia. What? Lem's friends, you trust them? I don't know them. I don't know you either. I know a grift when I see it. Takes a con man to know a con man? Maybe. But either way, those vampires are up to something. Yeah. You have my attention. I can talk to dead people. Vampires make dead people. If there are ghosts in there, maybe they can tell us what Zach and his friends are up to. I need a lookout. Unless you really think they're not dangerous. No vamps. Not sensing any spirits yet. Oh, God. A ghost? Worse. They bled her to death. Not quite. We need to get you out of here. Why? Look at where you are. You lost a lot of blood. I didn't lose it. I gave it. I hitched a ride back in Tulsa. I'm having a blast. You guys are doing just fine. You know Pia always gets her way. Mm-hmm. Remember Buenos Aires? Yes. You tried to stake me. Olivia, Manfred, what's up? You should know, that blood bag Zach's carrying... It's from a girl they're keeping in the back of their bus. They're draining her. You were snooping around our bus? You are in my town. It's okay, Pia. Can't blame them for being suspicious. We're used to it. Girl on the bus, her name's Tiffany. She's a groupie. It's true. It's a thing. A thing? Zach and Pia can't drain energy like I can. They need blood. Groupies are the most humane way, a willing food supply. Humane? She can barely move. A stop at the Waffle House, and Tiffany will be as good as new. It's a hard thing to understand, since you're not one of us. All right, then. Enjoy your reunion. I need a minute with Olivia. You hate them. Hey, I guess I don't see what you see, since I'm not one of you. I've been a vampire a long while. Most of that time, Zach was by my side. Well... Look who's here. I had to make an example out of Abraham. You cost me, boy. Now I own you. Oh, my God! Dinner's not over. Feel better? Yeah. Much better. All vampires are killers. Except for Lem? He's the exception. He always has been, but make no mistake, this nest is dangerous. You are food. Lem said they changed. People do change. Are you willing to bet your life on it? You have to protect yourself. Remind me again why you thought I'd be safe here. Midnight's safe. You just might have to fight to keep it that way. Hey. Come in. Looks like we're both worried about the same thing. Great minds worry alike. This is... Is for you. I adjusted it, so instead of arrows... You can stake one without getting too close. I just want you to be able to protect yourself. Tha... Thank you. What are you doing? Nothing. Don't worry. I saw Fiji lift a car, Creek. I know Lem's not exactly the same as us. Tell me what's going on. There's a nest of vampires in Midnight. Like Uncle Lem. No. They're nothing like Lem. So should we be worried? No. We should be prepared. Go get a knife. I don't think I've ever seen you in my church before. First time for everything. Chuy's in El Paso... NailCon. No one comes here for company. Sanctuary, confession, yes. I'm assuming it's the latter. The reason you haven't seen me here before... I'm fallen. I once was an angel. And now? Now I'm living a grounded life with someone I love. And it's a life I want to protect. And you think the nest threatens that. Vampires are just the beginning of the threat. I guess when an angel comes heralding a warning, I suppose I should listen. Fallen angel. I'm speaking to you as a neighbor and a friend. And a reverend, who will hear your confession and keep your secret. The veil that Midnight sits upon... It's fraying... And evil is being drawn here. You've felt it, haven't you? Last time I turned, the hunger was insatiable. So what do we do about this? There's no "we". Chuy and I may not be here much longer. And after we're gone, someone needs to know the truth, 'cause there will come a time when Midnighters are gonna have to make a choice... To leave or to fight. A pencil? You got to pierce the heart, pretty boy. They killed the hardware store guy. His name was Henry. He was a good man. They lied. They killed him, and anyone in town could be next. Waiting for sunrise, not that great a plan anymore, huh? We need to warn everyone. It's time for Mass. Poor Henry. At least we're safe. Uh, my house is inhospitable to the dead. It's why I never invite Lem for dinner. Hey, we need to be ready. Go on offense. There's a lot of vampires. We need more than crossbows and stakes. We need... Targeted weapons. What, like supernatural weapons? You're a witch... In a witchcraft store. We need to get creative. Creative... I can do that. Oh, I begged for months. Then finally, New Year's Eve, 1888, Zach caved. Mm, a rare moment of weakness. Mm. And that's how little Pia was brought into the family. You ever gonna turn Olivia? I'm not interested. Wait till you spot your first crow's feet. Would you two mind giving me and Lem a few minutes alone, please? Sure. I'll be in the bar. Must be nice being here. It's a cold world out there for our kind. We're always on the run. It's exhausting. Why are you here, Zachariah? You're not just passing through, are you? I forgot how special this place was. Energy here is more powerful than I remember. Midnight called to me. I feel like I belong here. We belong here. What are you asking me for? I'm asking you to let us stay. She's not answering. Why would they lie to Lem? Can't help it. Vamps are bloodthirsty and cruel. Lem said they were friends. Once. A lot has happened since. There's something you need to know. You've been a party pooper for months. We got you a gift to lift your spirits. Just close your eyes. It'll hurt for a second. Then it'll feel good. And then it's over. Still a slave... And this time to blood. I can't do this anymore. Wait until daylight. Then sneak out the back stairs. You'll be fine. You're letting me go? Yes. Maybe I'll join you, sneak into the daylight, put an end to this. You don't have to kill yourself. You can change. I chose my path a long time ago. It's never too late. Do you want to put this curse behind you? I can help you. Who are you? My name is Xylda. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Enjoy the girl? What did she do to you? She saved me. That gypsy girl made you turn your back on us. I gave you eternal life. I ran away from evil, only to become worse. If it wasn't for Xylda, I would've ended my eternal life. So instead, she gave you ultimate power. Power over us. I didn't want power. But you did. I made you. We're family. My family's here now. I'm sorry, but you can't stay. Mazatlan it is. Lem, it was good to see you after all this time. You know? Hmm? You too. Mm. Let's not end the night this way, huh? A drink, hmm? For old times' sake. What do you say? Right. To old friends. I'll miss you, Zach. I'll miss you. Mm. What are they doing? Zach's reminding Lem who he is. Blood's thicker than water. Yeah, safe travels. What did you do? He drank blood laced with silver. And I got something else for you. Ah! No! You're taking her place, bitch. Aah! Ah. Aah! Kill 'em all! First time we've gathered the town for Mass in a long while. Still waiting on Manfred and the Lovells. Nothing out back. It's quiet. Okay. Hang on. Whoa, whoa. It's me. I've been calling. Why? What are you doing here? The vampires, they're on the attack. Y'all need to come with me. You again. I don't want you coming around here. Dad, you need to listen to him. No, I don't. Sorry, there's no time. We need to get somewhere safe, now. If he didn't like Manfred before... I know. What's going on? Dad, just stay back. Hang on. He killed them. Turn around. They're vampires, Dad. Vampires? I'm taking you to the church, where vampires can't go. So shut up, sit down. You're welcome. Oh! Manfred! Oh. Change of plans. Hold on. Go. Go, go, go, go, go! What was that? Oh, right. Uh, Fiji made this place, um, inhospitable to the dead. Thanks, Fiji. Great. Oh, this quartz is sometimes called the sunrise crystal. With light behind it, it could emulate UV light, I-like sunlight. Sounds more science than magic. Well, who's to say they're not one and the same? I can make this work. I thought vampires couldn't get in. Me too. Ah! Get that out of my face! You're okay. Great! No, not great. I didn't make it to the chapel. There was too many of them. I knew your house would be safe. They have Lem. He can defend himself. Not anymore. They poisoned him. What? With silver. He's completely defenseless until it wears off. They're gonna kill him. Not if we kill them first. We got sunlight now. They're all over town. What if we lure 'em to one spot and blast 'em with this? We're gonna need a bigger light. Sorry it came to this, but you didn't give me a choice. You took everything from me. You chose the life you're living. I took nothing from you. It doesn't matter. The sun will be up soon. You'll be gone. Those humans you call friends, they'll be dinner soon enough. I should've killed you when I had the chance. She freed me. She can free you, too. You'll never have to kill another human again. Why would I want that? They're food. We could live a life without killing, without bloodshed. I like the killing, the blood. You love the taste of blood more than any of us. I'm happy the way I am. Then there's nothing left to say. Leave Midnight and never come back. This is our home. We're not leaving. I won't let you stay. Don't forget who you are. I made you. I can unmake you. Take care of him. Wait. That's what this gypsy girl gave you? Because I'll definitely take some of that. You had your chance. Now leave. Or I'll end you, too. Aah! Aah! We have a problem. Olivia's hurt. Manfred... Olivia can't bring the light. We can't just sit here and wait for them to die. You here to apologize? No. But upside for you, if this doesn't work, you don't have to worry about me anymore. Hey, Rev. We're gonna need that light. Manfred is willing to risk his life to save Lem. But for it to work, we need divine intervention. I have something for Zach. He wants the power that Lem has, I can give it to him. That's right. Back off. He's an idiot. He's also out there trying to save Lem. Zach! Come on out! I know what the gypsy girl did to Lem! I'm Xylda's grandson! I'll make you as powerful as Lem! Come on! Want to make a deal? Manfred, no! "Our Father, who art in Heaven, "hallowed be Thy name..." What do you want in return? Leave Midnight. That's not gonna happen. Well, how about letting me and the rest of the tow, Lem included, walk out of here alive? Fair enough. "Lead us not into temptation, "but deliver us from evil..." What is this? A grift. Then you're a dead man. Aah! Lem. Lem. Okay, here. I got you. I got you! Aah! I can't break them. You have to help me. Too weak. Okay. Okay. Here, here, drink this. Ah. Olivia got to him in time. Come on, man. It's safe? It's safe. I can give you a ride. How'd you get the light up there? Snuck in. You really stepped up, risking your life like that. Thank you. You saved everyone here. I never intended to taste your blood. I wasn't about to let you die. Even after you heard about who I was? Dark past? Join the club. Might want to clean up. For what? Hey. Hi! Hi. Oh, embarrassing. Yeah. Oh. Um, um, about that hug. I... Oh, God. Another embarrassing moment. Um... You know that I get emotional when I'm scared... And a little crazy. And I feel so comfortable around you and... Well, that's why I'm here. I want you to know that I do, too. You're my closest friend. Oh. Mm. Hmm... I know I can always count on you. Yeah. Hmm. Have you been sleeping with that psychic? His name's Manfred, and he saved our lives. No, I'm not sleeping with him. So stop looking for trouble where there is none. That guy is trouble. He's the definition of trouble. Keep away from him. He is going to lead you down the wrong path. Can I hitch a ride?
