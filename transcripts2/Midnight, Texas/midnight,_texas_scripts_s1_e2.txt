 and the dead is awful thin here. Aubrey, what is it you need to tell me? Pecados? [screaming] Hey, we got something! Aubrey wasn't who you thought. She was married. Name's Peter Lowry. If you were gonna kiss me, now would be a good time. You're under arrest for the murder of Aubrey Hamilton-Lowry. - I did not kill her! - She's a witch. Tomorrow's a full moon.

 [metal creaking] [dramatic music] [growling] ♪ Ah! ♪ Here. ♪ I think we lost it. How bad is it? [gasping] - Ah. - [gasps] Oh, my... it's not that bad. - Never play poker. - Sorry, sorry. I just need to apply pressure. - [gasps] - Does that hurt? - Less so at the moment. - Well, good. It's the least I can do. Just so you know, once I'm not bleeding, I'll try for that kiss again. Well, just so you know, a little blood doesn't scare me. ♪ [crashing] [screams] ♪ - Take this. - What? - Nothing with bullets? - I'm new to Texas. ♪ - Where is... - [metal ripping] [gasping] [growling] - Any ideas, Grandma? - Grandma? She's dead. I see her. Stop talking and run. - Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - -- www.Addic7ed.com -- _ [distant thumping and growling] [windows rattling] [faint screaming] Bad night? "Go to Midnight," you said. "Small, out of the way place. Nice folks. Just lay low, work, make money." - So that's a "yes." - That house is infested. Ghosts and whatever the hell's growling in there. Oh, and I just promised the town I'd help with... [phone buzzing] Hightower's been calling all night. Remember what you used to say? When the going gets tough... We live in a house with wheels. [laughs] I know... But that was before I died. You don't have me anymore, Manny. You need people. It's a lot more than I signed up for. It'll be worth it. Midnighters protect each other. Sure, great, kumbaya. You saw it with your own eyes. [exhales deeply] I don't know if I can handle going back in there. It's Midnight. You don't need to pretend you're normal. Let your freak flag fly. Tell 'em what's up. ♪ This is bad. The police came into our town and took one of us. I should've let you crush them. Stop. I made it worse for Bobo. You didn't show them anything they didn't already suspect. Bobo is going to have to face the consequences of our actions tonight. We scared the police, and that never goes over well. No, we need to get back off their radar... where we belong. And bring Bobo home. That shouldn't be too difficult, since he didn't kill Aubrey. I need help. That's an understatement. Here's the thing. My place is overrun with ghosts and all sorts of evil crap. Crap? - Can you be more specific? - Poltergeist. Demonic entity, maybe. Well, that should be taken care of. What makes you think it's demonic? The growling, for one. It's evil as... Sure you're not trying to weasel out of keeping your word? No, I want to get answers from Aubrey. I'm just saying, the chaos back at my place will make it hard. I need backup. The sun will be up shortly. I'm out. Whatever you need. I know my way around haunts. I'll go. I'm curious. You know CPR? Just in case it doesn't go well. You got the wrong man. Well, the gun that shot her was registered to you. Well, that might be true, but it doesn't change the fact that I didn't kill her. She was married to a skinhead. I didn't know until you told me. Okay, well, let's... let's say that you didn't kill her. Who did? Isn't that your job? It seems to me that your neighbors didn't seem to be too fond of Aubrey. What with the crime scene being what it was, dead animals, occult look... With all the rumors and stories, it's easy to assume the worst about Midnight. Folks tend to let their imagination run wild. Oh, did I imagine your little friend stopping and crushing my car with her mind? Did I imagine that? I got no idea what you're talking about. [exhales] Well... I got an idea. Just let me handle it. ♪ Sure you have nothing you want to say? Nope. [suspenseful music] ♪ Bobo Winthrop. Peter Lowry, Aubrey's husband, wants us to give you a message. ♪ [grunting, blows landing] ♪ [yells] [grunting] ♪ Oh! ♪ [grunts] I didn't kill her. So tell Lowry to stop coming after me. It's barely morning. The moon won't be up for a long time. Too many variables. Too many strangers. I'd rather be safe than not. There's no need to worry. It's taken me a lifetime to find a home where I'm accepted, so I worry. If anything happens, don't hesitate. Make sure no one's hurt. I feel dread. Something is different. We do this every month. I'll see you tomorrow morning. [chains rattling] [flies buzzing] ♪ [shudders] You were right. Some seriously bad mojo. Do you see any ghosts now? Yeah. [faint murmuring] My Goddess. [low growling] Whoa. You saw that too? That definitely feels like some sort of demonic spirit. [water gurgling] What is it? Aubrey's here. ♪ Are you gonna talk to her? Yeah, something like that. Just, uh, stay back. [flies buzzing] Aubrey? We need your help. [water gurgling] ♪ Bobo's in jail. So if he didn't do it, I need you to show me who did. [water gurgling and dripping] You can, uh... borrow my body. Show me what happened. ♪ [gagging] ♪ [screams] ♪ - [gagging and spitting] - Manfred! We need to get him out of here. Come on. ♪ [chimes tinkling] Drink that. You'll feel better. [groans] I haven't slept that deep in a long time. Your place is quiet. It's more than quiet. Inhospitable to the dead. I gave it a deep cleanse before I moved in. Mediums don't usually stay long in Midnight. I imagine it's got to be hard on you. Pawn shop's not my favorite place. Yeah. I saw the murder. A biker killed Aubrey. Sons of Lucifer? - You know them? - I see 'em around. White power jerks. Aubrey was married to one. I'm sorry, what? [laughs] Confused? Join the club. Poor Bobo looked like he got punched in the gut when Livingston told him. You need to tell the police what you saw. - I didn't see who killed her. - You know enough to point them away from Bobo. You really think he'll believe me? He might. You led him to the gun. It's a long shot, yeah, but we're neighbors now. It's what Midnighters do. Plus, you promised. Sure. - Sure, I'll be neighborly. - Great. While you're doing that, I'll get to working on your house. - With whatever that is? - It's a devil's net. Captures evil. Lets me measure malevolent energies. We have got to take care of your house ASAP. That thing under the floor? It's worrisome. You think by conjuring Aubrey, I... invited it in? You know, like I said before, Midnight's on a veil between worlds. Maybe you did. Regardless, we got to get it back on its side of the veil. How? An exorcism. Great. But I will need to prepare. So while that's happening, you talk to Livingston. ♪ I got to give Manfred a ride to the police station. ♪ Before you go... ♪ I found this... while I was doing laundry. Tell me you did not go flying. I went flying. Someone could have seen you. I know, but with Aubrey's murder, Manfred's arrival, I was worried. Worried about what? About the end of everything we know and love. I gotta go. We're finishing this conversation. I know. I love you. [chuckles] ♪ [country rock music] ♪ [whistles] Hey. What are you and Joe doing? Um, I saw something. I think it can help Bobo. Oh, well, good luck. You help him, everybody's gonna be really grateful. Yeah, I'm just trying to do the right thing. [laughs] Well, now you're just trying to impress me. Is it working? I don't know. Uh, I'm working tonight, but maybe later - this week we can... - See you, Joe. Have a nice day. Hey, Joe. ♪ Let's go to Davy. ♪ Had the Sons of Lucifer patch on the back of his jacket. And this face mask, like a skeleton. - But you didn't see his face? - No. She didn't get a good look. I was right about the gun. - That was very specific. - Okay, fine. Specific. The night Aubrey died, she was taking a walk, clearing her head. She didn't know what to do. She wanted to tell Bobo she'd lied, but she was scared. She didn't want to lose him. - And she said all this? - In a way. She... her spirit showed me what happened. What she remembered. ♪ A truck shows up. Right away she knows something's not right. She goes for the pistol in her bag, but it didn't help her. - [screams] - [gunshot] The guy jumped her from behind, took the gun, and shot her with it. After that, she was in and out of consciousness for a while. She remembers being in the back of the truck. She saw him toss the gun. And then she was dragged to the river's edge. Other things had died there. Aubrey realized she was being left there to die. It took a while. [gasping] Three days, to be specific. [sighs] Okay. It could be that her ghost told you all of this. There could be a simpler reason. ♪ I killed her? He wouldn't have come if he were involved. The gun was dumped in the river. Guessing that's not the only evidence he got rid of. You really want to find the killer, you keep looking. ♪ That was pretty badass. I hope it helps. I got faith. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Resume the search further downstream. Humor me. In case we missed something. Thanks. Back from the hospital? One's still in surgery. Knee's being rebuilt. The others are stable. Good thing they're Nazis, or I'd feel bad. Think this is funny? - [laughs] - It's not. You're suspended. - What? - Till further notice. Okay, so I pushed a little hard. Effective immediately. [tense music] ♪ Since I was a kid, I've known Midnight's all sorts of bad. Now we've seen it. Those Midnighters are dangerous, and you know it. ♪ "But now ask the beasts, "and let them teach you. And the birds of the heavens, let them tell you." ♪ [groaning, bones cracking] Or speak to the earth and let it teach you. ♪ You sure about this? Mirrors in séances can get messy. [laughs] You don't need 'em 'cause you can see the dead. I can't. The mirrors help me see the spirit realm. You know, glimpse other dimensions. Ooh. - Belonged to my grandma. - Feels powerful. Yeah, supposedly my ancestors fought demons and demonic possessions back in Europe. Grandma, packrat that she was, she kept a ton of stuff. Probably illegal. I'm intrigued. But that's for another time. Now we have an exorcism to perform. You ready? As ready as I'll ever be. [ominous music] ♪ - Whoa. - Bad as before? ♪ [faint screaming] Worse. Well, there's some evil present, for sure. ♪ [bright ding] Spirits who once called this place home, we need to talk. [overlapping whispering] They listening? Not so much. More like circling me. You're their ride back to the living. I can't compete. I need to be alone. They need to have no other options for leaving. You can be hijacked. I can't. Right, I'll just be on the porch if you need me. ♪ - [bright ding] - As I was saying. Spirits, we need to talk. ♪ [crashing, cat yowls] [gasps] [cat meows] God, I hate cats.

[upbeat country rock music] ♪ [growling] [gunshots] ♪ You let him out, didn't you? No, she did. ♪ So, if it bites you, do you... You're born a were, dimwit. Not exactly common knowledge.

Here, have Madonna take a look at it for you. ♪ [sighs] I need ammo. [door clinking open] ♪ We have to stop it before it hurts anyone else. Silver makes me sick, but if one of those so much as grazes the Rev, he's dead. Well, it's not the Rev we're dealing with anymore. ♪ Ah. It's the last one. [exhales sharply] [soulful singing] How do you know how to do this? Well, to live in Midnight, you need to know how to protect yourself, and the people that you love. And that girl over there is one of 'em. ♪ She's sweet on you. But so far, the only thing you've brought here is trouble. ♪ So don't make me regret sewing you up. ♪ - I won't. - Hmm.

I know what I did. ♪ Bobo. One of your neighbors came forward with some information. We followed it up. We found a Sons of Lucifer jacket downstream from where we found the pistol. There was a hair in the zipper. It matched Aubrey. You think her husband did this? Well, let's just say that he is a person of interest. Now, we're looking for Lowry. If you see him first... I'll call you. ♪ Thank you, Sheriff. - Hey, good luck. - Thank you. ♪ Deliver her from evil. Bid her soul eternal rest. Amen. Been a long time since I've killed. It's not your fault. Well... the weretiger is me. Before coming to Midnight, I spent a lot of time alone. Tigers are solitary, but humans... Not so much. It's hard, reconciling both sides. That's why I'm a reverend. I suppose I'm trying to find meaning in this duality. - Any luck? - Yes. Being a reverend led me here. This is my home, my purpose. And I don't want to lose it. You won't. We won't let that happen. ♪ Last night was different. Usually, a bull is enough to sate me. This time it wasn't. Something is different. And that scares me. Yeah. ♪ [deep voice] Fiji.

We're done here. ♪ I stayed for 40 days ♪ ♪ Evil is being drawn here. Human evil, supernatural evil. And it's just beginning. The more that evil takes hold, the more the veil frays... Until it breaks altogether. ♪ How do you know all this? A millennia ago, the last time it tore, I was here. So that's it? We wait for this to happen? Maybe not. There's a prophecy. An army will rise to battle the evil and seal the veil forever. That army will be led by a man with the gift of vision, who can bridge the living and the dead. The new guy? My combo housewarming and... "thanks for saving my ass" gift. - That's awesome, thanks. - Oh, yeah. Fiji told me what you did. Um... Aubrey, she... she wanted to tell you the truth. Her husband asked her to get to know you, but what she felt for you, that was... That was real. Thanks for that. But the woman I love, she didn't exist. [knocking at door] Bobo. Glad to have you back. Nice to be back. I'm just checking. How's the stitches? [hisses] Painful. - Mm-hmm. - But um... At least there's a good story with the scar. Hmm. Ooh.
