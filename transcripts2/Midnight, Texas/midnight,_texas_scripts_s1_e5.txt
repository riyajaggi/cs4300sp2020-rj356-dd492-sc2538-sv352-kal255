 If you want this thing between us to continue, my dad cannot know what we've been doing on my lunch breaks. Didn't hear Hightower's latest message? It'll be the last thing you hear. He wants my heart on a platter. He knows where I live. Would've been easy enough to shoot me when I opened the door, but he didn't. He wants to make you suffer first. Yeah, he's doing a pretty good job. Hon, I wish I never got you into this mess. Didn't even have the decency to stay alive to help me out of it. Truth is, I wanted that money as much as you. Do I meet him?

 No. You ask for help. Stop that, Mr. Snuggly. My goddess, you're rude. He'll warm to me. Everyone does, eventually. Eventually. Are you hungry? I can make us pancakes. Yeah, I'll have some. Stay here. It's a fire. What's going on? Some water. Get some water. Lem and Olivia are still in there. Come on. What? No, no, no, no, stay back, stay back. The Sons of Lucifer did this? Olivia! Lem okay? Yeah, he slept through it. He doesn't have to breathe. I do. I'll be right out. Just a big ol' distraction. Who's there? Down here, dimwit. Fiji's cat? Yep, and oh, my beeswax, the cat talks. Now that that's out of the way, we got to move on. They took Fiji. What do you mean they took her? I mean they came in the store, put a thingy over her mouth, and dragged her out, she's gone. She feeds me. Can't be away for too long. Bobo Winthrop. Well, this has been a long time coming. I suspect you know who I am. Peter Lowry. So, Winthrop, is there anything you'd like to say to me? Where's Fiji? I'm disappointed. I was expecting an apology. You know, "Sorry about Aubrey"? What? What did you do with Fiji? She's fine for now. She'll be fine as long as I get what I want. I want the weapons. I want the money. I want all of it. Done. Where do you want to meet? I'll get back to you. No, wait, let's do this now. I can be ready... Let's go. Hi. Hey. It's a slow morning. Apparently pipe bombs drive off customers. Makes sense. You ever think about leaving Midnight? All the time. Well, what if we did? Vegas, Grand Canyon. I've got a house with wheels. It's doable. Why are you running? I'm not running. It's this guy I owe money to. The one who shot you? Yeah, he sort of found me, and I thought... That he wouldn't find you in the Grand Canyon? Yeah. That. I'm not leaving my brother here alone with my dad. You know that. Can't blame a guy for trying. You don't have to run, you know? You could ask people for help. The timing's not great, what with Bobo's being bombed and all. That doesn't mean that folks won't help. Unless you want to run. Well, yeah, it's my instinct to bolt. It's what I do. It's what I've always done. Except that maybe for the first time ever I feel like I've got a reason to stay put. So, Creek, do I? You do. You stay put. Okay, good. Great. Can I borrow your car? Bobo? You here? These have been in my family for a long time. Some of it dates back to the 13th century. How much you want for all this? 20,000 dollars. Fifteen. I really appreciate it. You want a pistol? What makes you think... Oh, I don't know. Maybe. Might not be bad to have. Sorry about what happened. At least no one got hurt. Hello? Somebody. Please. Oh. Hey, there, Curly. I thought you were gonna sleep all day. You don't... You don't know what I'm capable... Right now, you're not capable of finishing that thought. And I do know. Heard all about your little trick with the pool cue down at the Cartoon Saloon. Very impressive. The drowsiness? That's the fentanyl patch. It's like morphine, but a hundred times stronger. It'll keep you from doing that voodoo that you do. You won't stop... Stop me. Okay, just keep telling yourself that. You... You won't... You... Who did this? Sons of Lucifer. It's me they're after, so let me take care of it. It stopped being just about you when they bombed Olivia's home. Tell me where and when. Service road off Ranchville Drive. Come alone. We see anyone else, Curly's dead. You understand me? Yeah. I understand. I remember when you first moved here. Offered to buy this shop in cash. I knew you were running from something bad. I didn't ask questions then. I'm asking now. What do they want from you? In case the bikers come back. Can I come in? I once asked you what you did for a living, and you said... People got problems. They hire me to get rid of those problems. Right. Manfred has problems. Oh. You're right. I was running. From my family. This belonged to your family? Yeah, my parents are wealthy, well-connected, and... White supremacists. Hmm... Hightower? I'm here. I've got money. They had big plans for this stuff. Once I found out about it, I didn't want it on my conscience, so I left. With their stuff? Story spread. This cache became a holy grail of sorts for the white power crowd. One of Lowry's guys must have figured out who I was. That's why he sent Aubrey. Manfred said that Aubrey's feelings for me were real. That's probably why Lowry killed her. Now he's got Fiji. Not for long. Let's bring her home. Lem, I got to go alone. If I don't, they'll kill her. I can't take that risk. I'm afraid that doesn't work for me. Safety's on. Why are you here, and how'd you find me? Creek asked me, and I found the note in the Manfred-in-a-box. I appreciate the concern. Don't appreciate you breaking into my RV. Either way, I got this. Do you? Look, I'm a professional. You rescued Lem from the vampire nest, so I owe you, and I don't like owing people. I don't want you to get hurt. I won't. So, this guy... Your grandma conned him? Out of $100,000. I got 78 with me. I'll front you the rest. Let's get this weirdo. It's okay. I got cash. I'm ready to settle this. Added bonus. you settle, and I don't have to kill you. Too late. What are you talking about? Oh, jeez. Violet. Not Hightower? No. That's his daughter. What else is she? Manfred, just tell her. Violet was... She and I were engaged. You walked out on her, left her at the altar. Well, that's not very nice. And it's also not why I'm here. A $100,000. I'll throw in interest. That work for you? No. Not really. Might've mentioned the whole telekinetic thing! That's black magic. It's bad. Yeah, I see that! Let's get out. Yeah. Manfred! You can't outrun me! Is everything settled? Oh, we're not even in the vicinity of settled. What's going on? Yeah, Manfred, what's going on? It wasn't just my grandma who stole. Xylda and I did it together. We ran a grift on him. Okay, so you stole money. More than that. It's personal. Psychics, mediums run in my family. A power passed on by blood. Hightower's a gypsy, but no abilities. Except for that glass trick that almost shredded us. He gave an eye for that. Hightower's old world, wanted to be patriarch of a powerful family, a magical family. Where is this going? Xylda made him an offer. I'd marry his daughter, Violet. And get magic in his bloodline. Wow. So, Violet is... Dead. Dad's carting her corpse around. Did you... No, no, no, I didn't kill her. I left her at the altar. Hightower paid Xylda right before the ceremony. We took off as soon as the wedding march started. A few weeks later, she killed herself. It's the worst thing I've ever done. I wish I could take it back. My break's almost over. I've got to go. I should've told you. No, I understand why you didn't, because it's awful, but the thing is that my dad has been telling me that you're bad news and nothing but trouble and why did you have to go and prove him right? Remember me? From the cell? I got everything Lowry asked for. It's all there. We're good. Now where is she? Not here. We'll take you to her. After. Payback's a bitch. Get him! Lem, where the hell are you? Are you with Fiji? Bobo? Call me back. Where is he? Check his house? Of course I checked his house, his RV. Then I don't know what to tell you. If you don't know what to tell me, would you know if... If I flicked my finger and pushed that fork down her throat... Enough. I know where he's hiding. Are you sure you want to do this? After you. No! No! No! Once you calm down, we'll talk. No! No! Thought you'd be taller. I did everything you asked. Where is she? She's alive... Which is more than I can say for my wife. What happened to Aubrey, that's on you. I suppose in a way you're right. Wish I never involved her. Aubrey was so sweet. I figured she'd wrap you around her finger, get the information out of you. I was wrong. I got what I want, but I don't have her. Anyway, let's find out what you brought. But if you hold out on me, you try anything, I'll bury Fiji alive, suffocate her slow. He's settling down. I'm going in there. It would be easier and less of a time-suck if you'd just let me end it. Xylda and I were wrong to do what we did, and Violet died because of it. I've been running from this for a long time. It's finally caught up with me. I need to man up, face it. This is about Creek, isn't it? I just want to get out from under this without more bloodshed. And yeah, it's about Creek. But, since Hightower was insane enough to sacrifice an eye for... I'll stand by. Yeah. You happy? Chaining me up like a dog? I'm not happy, about any of this. I'll be happy when I'm not looking over my shoulder every day. I saw you guys come up here. Manfred's with Hightower. Oh, well... He's good at talking his way out of things, so... He is. Right now he's trying to level with him, though. Mind if I stay? I can't defend what Xylda and I did. I can't. No, you can't. I can tell you I'm not the same man. I've changed. And I'm willing to do anything to settle this. Oh, you want to settle this, yeah? Well, let's see. What is it that you owe? Well, there's the money you stole. There's the suffering. And finally there's her life. So, suffering? You want a life for a life? If that's what you want, we're even. Right after I bailed on the wedding, like, a day later, Xylda got sick. We went through the money fast. Chemo's pricey. While she was dying, we joked that you finally got that power you always wanted, because... God, you cursed us hard. We both lost family. You lost nothing! You still see her. You still talk with her! You want to talk to Violet? No, no... I can make that happen. No. Torturing me, what's it gotten you? You feel any better? Killing me won't bring her back. It won't give you closure. Maybe talking to Violet will. Are we happy? We're real happy. Looks like you held up your end of the bargain, so I'll take you to her. You moved her? I didn't want to leave her out in the open. She's down there. What are you doing? Insurance policy. You do what you said you'll do, give me peace, closure... I'll let you leave. But if not... Well, then, you'll join Violet. Fantastic. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Are you okay? Hey, hey. Look at me, look at me. The patch. The patch. If you hurt her... Are you kidding me, man? If I hurt her, what? My God! You killed my wife. I didn't! You've been lying so long you're starting to believe them yourself. He doesn't lie. You don't know, do you? You don't know about his family? About who he was before he came to your freak town? Mr. All-American here? He was once one of us. No, no, no. I'll explain later. You gonna explain that church outside Atlanta? The one that got bombed? He was right there, ground zero. Let us out of here. Mmm, no. You're gonna stay. And don't worry about the weapons. We'll be sure to make your daddy proud. Oh, yeah. Not bad. Now, how about a moving target? What the hell are you waiting for? Bet you that's Lem. What is it? Air's feeling a little... Thin? Violet... We didn't know each other all that well, but you seemed nice. You can't be okay with this. I didn't do right by you, but... Your father's insane, and I need help. God, Violet. I'm so sorry. I never meant to hurt you. You left. You didn't think that would hurt? Well, yeah, but I... I didn't think you'd kill yourself over me. I didn't. So, where's my father? Are you praying? Gathering all the air we have. Come close. Again. Saving my life. We should save air. Ashes to ashes. How the hell is he still walking? Open fire! That hurt. Violet's spirit is with me. How do I know you're telling the truth? Help me prove you're here. The night before you ran out on me, my dad gave me a present. You gave her a christening dress for the grandchildren. You told her about her ancestors, how the Hightowers were once powerful psychics. You thanked her for bringing it back to the bloodline. Violet. It's you. Now where is she? She's right here. Violet, what is it you want to tell him? You tell my daddy... I hope he rots in hell! I'm sorry, Fiji. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Fiji. You okay? Are you? How about we talk once we're out of here? Come on. Sun's almost up. I'll be quick. You took everything. My men, my wife... For the last time, I did not kill Aubrey! Bobo. We should go. What did she say? What is my Violet telling you? Well, she's a little upset. Of course she's upset. You left her! I agreed to marry Manfred because of you! I wanted to please you! Your opinion's important to her. Tell him the truth! The past, Violet, that's another lifetime ago. We all did things we wish we could take back. Your father held you back. He still does. You're still tethered to this world because you're not letting go you need to forgive... I'm done being told what to do! It's the only way you'll get closure, the only way he will. I can think of another way. Daddy. Violet? My entire life, you controlled me. Forced me to do what you wanted. Tried to marry me off like chattel. I never mattered. I was always a means to an end! No. No, I... I am... I am sorry. If I could do it again... You can't! But I can. I killed the wrong person that night. Violet, enough! You do not get to use me. Violet, I'm done with people dying. Enough! Get out! Violet's gone. She said what she wanted you to know. Her spirit moved on. You okay? No. You promised me peace. I know. I'm sorry. So am I. Thank you. Can I just say... What were you thinking? Can we do this in the evening? Fiji was kidnapped, and you didn't tell me? Bobo made the call. Talk to him. I'm getting my stake, and I'm gonna stab the sh... You were worried about me. I love you, too. I need you to stop almost dying. I'm already dead. How are you? Better. I didn't know they were gonna bomb that church. I was 17, and my dad, he asked me to come with him. Said he was gonna teach me something. I stayed in the car, and by the time I figured out what was happening, it was too late. But I saw who they were. That night when they were celebrating, I left. Haven't seen my family since. Guess I figured they were... Dead. You never talked about them. This isn't about them. It's about you and me. I should've told you the truth. I was ashamed. Afraid of how you'd react. I thought I knew you. Like, really, deeply knew you. Sad thing is, you do. But I understand why you think otherwise. I need time. I'm here for you, Fiij. You made it out alive. Did he? Long story. I wasn't sure I'd see you again after... Your dead ex-fiancé fiasco? Look, if it's a deal breaker, I... It isn't. I'm impressed. You did everything you could to make it right. You tried. I'm sorry about what happened with your grandma. That really sucks. Yeah. It did. Can you stay a while? How about I stay the night? What are you gonna tell your dad? I already told him the truth: that I'm an adult, and he can't tell me how to live, and you and I are a thing. I mean, if you're still planning on staying. Now I am. So, I'm not running anymore. You're not hiding from your dad. This gonna get boring? Let's find out.
