 Previously on Midnight, Texas... My dad does not find out. Hightower's been calling all night. I know you're in Texas. Her real name, Aubrey Hamilton Lowry. She was engaged to me. She's married. Name's Peter Lowry. A white supremacist. I didn't kill her, so tell Lowry to stop coming after me. Shouldn't have let Bobo Winthrop out. Aubrey's husband is still out there,

 and as long as he is, this isn't over. Olivia... she's got more secrets than anyone. You seem angry. Perhaps I can take some of that from you. The veil that Midnight sits upon... it's fraying. Evil is being drawn here. What? No, I did not steal Daddy's Rolex. Quite frankly, I am offended that you would even think that. Huh? I'm losing you. You're cu...

 Mmm. Hi. Now, what's a sweet, young thing like you doing out here all alone? It ain't safe. How can some place so beautiful be dangerous? You have no idea. So why don't you hop up into my pride and joy here, and I'll take you anywhere you want to go. Come on, I don't bite. I really shouldn't. Well... I won't take no for an answer. Safety first. So, what brings you to Texas? I just felt this powerful pull to come here. I've been drawn to a lot of spiritual places... Sedona, Lily Dale, Glastonbury. But nothing like here. Uh-huh. It's the energy here. It makes me feel better than I've felt in a long time. Desert air's good. It's not just that. It's this land. It's ancient, powerful. It makes me feel things. What kind of things? Why don't you pull over? I'll show you. I've been meaning to ask you about that. Oh. Not much to tell. My... My grandma ran a scam on a guy, guy got mad. Is that guy gonna try and shoot you again? I'm working on paying off her debt. Oh, good. I'd hate for my dad to be right about you. Right about what? That you're a no-good con man who's gonna break my heart. Why would your father think that? I don't know. The online-psychic thing, the RV, the fact that it looks like you're running from something. Well, looks can be deceiving. Mmm. Not in this case, but they can. Well, what he doesn't know is that I don't care. I'm just using you for your body. Excuse me. I just figured after saving his entire family from vampires, the guy would have cut me some slack. Not even a little bit. So, if you want this thing between us to continue, it means my dad cannot know what we've been doing on my lunch breaks. Seriously. But if it makes you feel better, I think this whole sneaking-around thing's kind of hot. Well, it does feel less oppressive when you say it like that. I'm gonna text you after my shift. Hey, I brought you some... What's wrong? Investigation, my ass. They know who did it... Lowry, Aubrey's husband. Problem is they can't find him. They will. Well, I happen to know for a fact that Sons of Lucifer hangs out in the back room of the Cartoon Saloon. You're thinking about going there, aren't you? I don't know. Well, you should know. Don't. Just let the cops do their job and stay away from the Cartoon Saloon. He killed Aubrey... killed the sheriff. And you just got out of jail on suspicion of murder, and we risked our lives to get you out. And you going after Lowry's just gonna bring the cops right back to Midnight. That is not good for anybody. So you will stay out of it. You're totally right. Yep. You bet I am. I wasn't... thinking straight. You certainly were not. I'll stay clear of this whole mess. I... Promise. Good. Now, do you want to come over for dinner tonight? I am making shepherd's pie. I love your shepherd's pie. I know. Hello? I'll see you later. Okay. I need to speak to somebody who works here. That would be me. Did a guy come in here recently and pawn a Rolex? Did he drive a vintage red Caddy? Mmm. Ass-head. It's my brother. He's missing, and our parents are worried about him. He didn't happen to say where he was going? He didn't say. But I do think I know someone who can help you. I'm not sure moving here was a smart play. I thought you liked it. I've been seeing that cute waitress drop by. The online-psychic thing is fine, but I need to make some serious money. Hightower's not letting up. Well, how about your old clients? I bet those rich widows would love a little one-on-one with "The Great Manfredo." I doubt Bitzi Van Der Huff's gonna drive five hours to chat with her favorite dead husband in a crappy RV. You know what I'm saying. My A-list clients expect a certain level of pomp and circumstance... nice hotels, stocked mini bar. Makes them feel they're getting their money's worth. Don't fret, Manny. I got a feeling your luck's gonna change real soon. It better. That ain't gonna help. Actually, it does. You didn't hear Hightower's latest message. You remember that tune? It'll be the last thing you hear before I... He wants my heart... stopped, on a platter. Stop it. Hightower's old school. I'm worried this isn't just about money. He wants his pound of flesh. You settle this debt, he'll calm down. Yeah, easier said than... You the psychic? Depends who's asking. The guy at the pawnshop said you're the real deal. I need to find my brother. Not sure I believe in all this, but I got to try something. Yeah, well, finding a missing person's tough. Find him, I'll pay you five grand. And it's also my specialty. Please, step into my office. How long will you be gone for? Not long. Job's in El Paso. Why? I was wondering if you'd like to come over for dinner tonight. Oh, girls' night? And Bobo. Why would you invite a third wheel? This is your chance to get some of that. Bobo's single now. Olivia, he's still grieving. Please. The bitch was married... to a racist. He's not grieving. He's humiliated, and you're just the balm to soothe his broken heart. He's my best friend. I wouldn't even know what to do. Well, for one, no peasant skirts. But I like my skirts. Yeah. Men don't. Want to be more than besties? I could knit a sweater with those. And no sweaters. The only time Ted visits our parents is to beg for money or steal something, but now that he's missing, they're beside themselves. You ask me, he's probably holed up with some stripper again. I need something of your brother's, something meaningful to him... to give me a psychic impression, a clue as to where he is. Sure. Ted's pinkie ring. I took it as collateral last time I loaned him money. Will that do? I think so. Anything? What is it? Getting images. Does your brother work with heavy equipment? Ted doesn't even have a job. You can see me. Oh, yeah. Pats. Oh, Pats, you were right. I sucked as a brother, a son. It was all my fault. Should have never picked up that hot blonde. What hot blonde? See? I told you. Just at a rest stop. One minute, we're driving along. Next, something's eating me like a taco. And she stole my Caddy. Car won't start? Don't suppose you could give me a jump? I'll make it worth your while. Hell, yeah, I'll help. Maybe we should party first... then take care of the car. Mmm. You have been very bad. Well, I can be bad, too. Hey! Whoa. Take my wallet. I've already been paid for this. Wha... Wait! I'm here because you embezzled 401ks, pensions, college funds. Who sent you? A person who's life you ruined. Look, it's just money. It's just money because you have some. To my client, it was a house, a marriage, medical treatments. You destroyed a family's life all because you thought you could cheat. Now... the world is a better place without some people in it. And you're one of those people. Oh, my gosh. We should call 911. Oh, my God. Somebody... Do... I don't know. I'm looking for a hot blonde. Yeah, who isn't, buddy? She was maybe driving a vintage red Cadillac. Okay, then. Thanks. Hi. Why are you following me? I don't know what you're talking about. I saw you inside watching me, and now you're here... still watching me. No, I'm not. That's, uh, some sort of a coincidence. Yeah, but I don't believe in coincidences. Hey. Just changing my work clothes, and I'll be over. Well, no rush. Just setting the table. Well, I'll see you soon. Bye. Hey, babe. Do you mind getting my things in the trunk? Sure. Thanks. I see you brought your work home. Crap. You in there, Ted? ♪ This little light of mine ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ This little light of mine ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ Let it shine ♪ Let it shine ♪ Let it shine ♪ Oh, my. What's a girl to do around here? So many handsome men. So many naughty men. You're not my type. But you've been so bad. I can feel it. It makes me want to... Oh, this is tragic. Shut up. Shutting me up don't change the fact that you been stood up, my friend. You don't know that. Sure. But when you decide to face reality, how about putting a little of that shepherd's pie in my bowl? Hey, you running late? I hate to do this, but I got to cancel. Okay, um... Right. You know, I, I got to go. There's someone at the door. You busy? Nope, not anymore. I could use your help. More teeth. Yeah, but more... rows of teeth, mouth open like this gaping hellhole. And a spider web tattoo on the shoulder. And she was... Eating... people, yeah. Sounds like a succubus, which is odd. I haven't seen one around here in over a century. A succubus? Ancient supernaturals... hunters, rare. They usually lie low, and they have a perpetual glamour that lets them appear beautiful so they can seduce their prey. Prey? As in... men. Mmm-hmm. But they only feed on men who've caused pain. Wonder why she came after you? Yeah, why? So no... no one here has ever caused anyone pain? Fair enough. The real question is, why now? Why would a succubus show up here acting so recklessly? Why are you here? It's dinnertime. I'm hungry. Why are you acting so weird? Is Manfred in there? I'm being weird because you should be at home, and I'm at work. We... Look, I know you like Manfred, and we owe him. But Dad's right. You can't trust him, okay? He's a total sleazebag. What are you talking about? I followed him today. I saw him coming out of a strip club. He was looking for someone. I'm not worried, okay? So order something to go. This succubus is leaving a trail of bodies. And bodies will bring the law back here, and we can't have that. We need to stop her before she causes more damage. So how do we do that? Dragon's breath... according to medieval folklore. And Wikipedia. Okay. Short of finding a dragon, how do you stop a succubus? I think I know. Ross Wheeler. So, Ross... Please. You're not a cop. Why are you following me? I really think you got the wrong guy. Someone paying you to follow me? Frickin' crazy! Who hired you? No one! Want to tell me now? No one, no one. I swear. What? What's that? Your father! Your... your father hir... your father hired me. Yeah. Thought so. I'm making a tincture. It's really just a fancy word for potion. This will remove the succubus's glamour. Yeah. Without her looks, she will not be seducing anyone. See, it's really just basic chemistry. So we can slow her down, but how do we find her? She'll be looking for men. If a woman's trolling for guys around here, there's only one place to go on a Thursday night. Ow. My back. Can you just let me sit up? I'm not sure I'm gonna let you live, so you're back isn't of interest. So when did you start working for him? He hired me a month ago. Paying you a lot, isn't he? Yeah. Do you know why my dad is having me followed? I asked before I took the job 'cause I didn't want to get into a bad situation. Oh. Well, that didn't quite work out, now, did it? He just wants to know you're okay. I know you left, won't return his calls, his letters. He just wants to know how you are. How's everything going? You make a sound, and I will drown you in the toilet. You understand? You okay? Not by a long shot. Do you mind? No, never. Oh. You okay? I'll be fine. I'm heading out. Come. We could use you. Where to? It's ladies' night at Cartoon Saloon. I'll explain on the way. Well, he's not going anywhere. I could use the break. We just need to get a drop of tincture in the succubus's mouth. Then we have to get her away from people, somewhere private before anyone notices what's happening. We should split up. Blend in. Sure. Blend in. Really? Who is it? Pony Boy. I want to talk to Peter Lowry. I don't think I know the man. You enjoy the remodel? I know Lowry killed his wife and the sheriff. But he's the police's problem now. All I want is to be left alone. You make me sick, Winthrop. You're a traitor to your family, your race. You got so little pride, you'd rather pollute yourself by living with those... Bobo, we should go. Any of you set foot in Midnight again, I'll kill you. I'm sorry. For what... standing me up or almost killing a man right in front of me? Look, I'm not saying he didn't deserve it, but... but you coming down here by yourself is just plain dumb. Yeah, it was. You're right. It means a lot that you came after me. You look real pretty tonight. I didn't come after you. I came here with everyone. We have to... we have to find some hot blonde who's been killing men. I think that's her. Be careful. Hey. I should kick your ass. My... my bad. I thought she was... Tricia, my ex. I see her everywhere... when I wake up, when I'm driving, everywhere. I... I just can't really believe she's... she's gone for good, you know? She just walked out, and that's it. Five years. I feel you, brother, but you need to move on. You're good. Avoiding conflict, one of my skills. You need it growing up in a gypsy caravan. Wow. Vampires... now a succubus. At least you didn't expose yourself. You exposed yourself? The vampires were about to kill our friends. You can't keep taking risks like this. If they find us... Nobody's gonna find us. Right now we're dealing with a problem. You're here with me, okay? Okay. What are you drinking? Gave it up a while back. Sometimes I indulge... special occasions. But once I get a taste, it's hard to stop. Slippery slope and whatnot. Maybe you should 12-step it over to a meeting. Doesn't exactly work that way. Nope. Just a lot of ladies wearing cocoa butter body spray. Maybe she's somewhere else. Like, um... The Boobie Trap? How'd you know? My brother told me. He followed you. Okay, that's... that's creepy. He was worried about me. And you should have invited me. God. You really are perfect. Succubus? No. My brother. Connor? Sorry, don't fall for it. He's only 17. Go. Come here. I can't believe you followed me. Well, I was worried. Connor, I'm an adult, I get to take risks, and when you're an adult... You're so handsome. Connor, get in the truck. But I... Go. I mean it. Right now. Get in the truck. Go home. I don't live too far from here. Nice. Hey, cowboy, you want to get out of here? Mmm-hmm. Yeah? Come on. Go and unwind a bit. I would like that, yes. There we go. Get in there, pretty lady. Excuse me. What? You might want to think twice. Y'all are crazy! We need to get her out of sight. Got it. Is this normal? Transformations are always painful. Good job on the tincture. What have you done to me? I took away your glamour so you couldn't kill any more men. We had no choice. Supernaturals lay low in these parts. Indiscriminate hunting of humans will not be tolerated. She dead? Oh, God. You all expected that? No. That's a surprise. What do we do now? Creek! Help! That's Connor. Let's go. Everybody split up. Connor! What, do you see him? No. No, keep looking. I'll be right back. Where are you going? My RV. Connor! Connor, we're here! Connor! Wait, I'm begging you. Don't hurt him. He deserves it. They all do. Let him go. We know what you're going through. I struggle with appetites that I need to keep in check. Maybe I can help. Hey! Grab him. Stay back. Closest thing to dragon's breath I could find. Uh, quick thinking. Literally a hot mess. Speaking of which... Hey, Ross. I'm back. Now... What am I gonna do with you? Take care of him. Oh, God, please don't kill me. I'm not gonna kill the messenger... this time. She's feeling generous tonight. Let me tell you about your employer. He wasn't there when I was a kid. He left me with the woman he married, and she liked pills. But when her habit got out of control, he cut her off. But like I said, Dad was never around, so she found other ways to make her pill money... Me. There are a lot of twisted men out there, Ross, who will pay top dollar for a pretty girl. Your employer didn't worry about me then. He does not get to worry about me now. And if he sends anyone else, they'll die. And if I see you again, Ross... you'll die. Understand? Yeah. You're never gonna see me again. I'm sorry. I'll give you a minute to get changed. I fetched top dollar in my day, too. Oh, well, we have so much in common. And yet, all that pain gives you plenty to leech. I'm sorry for what they did to you. Don't be. You saved me. And the other guys? Oh, they're all dead. Here. What are you thinking? I'm just thinking about how that succubus scared the crap out of me. Well, it serves you right for following me. Let's go home. Would you do me a favor? Not that you deserve it. Don't tell Dad about tonight. I was gonna ask you the same thing. Her hunger was unstoppable. It's happening. The veil's affecting supernaturals. I think so. What if we can't fight the pull? What if I can't? Look, we've got plenty of time to be scared. Tonight we're okay. We're safe. Come here. Let's just worry about tonight. Sounds like a plan. Sorry about what happened to him. Yeah, well... we never would have found Ted's body without your help. Thank you. Hey. How's Connor? He's good. He's grateful. Wasn't a big deal. Shut up. Hey. Hey. Twice now. You made sure I got out of jail... last night with the skinheads. No matter what, you're always there for me. Of course I am, Bobo. You're my best friend. Huh. Is that it? Is that all you want this to be? 'Cause sometimes I think my life's been better since you've been in it, and... and I wonder if I shouldn't just...
