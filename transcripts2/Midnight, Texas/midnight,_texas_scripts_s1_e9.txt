 Previously on Midnight, Texas... It's not as charming as your old bus. You were snooping around our bus? I don't know who I am. That's something that I need to be alone to figure out. I love you. Okay. So there's a demon who's got a thing for death and a veil to hell, making evil run amok. Biting is not on the menu! Once you turn, you'll like it! Olivia, I'm so... Back off!

 There's a demon in my house. Fiji, when he rises, and you will be his. Who are you talking about? Colconnar. - That's his name? - Fiji... What is it? I hear him. Fiji... Fiji... Do I know you? You do. Colconnar sent me. He said the demon was gonna rise. That by offering a truckload of dead bodies, it would usher in the beginning of the end.

 I know, and I'm not surprised. The death and violence that's come to Midnight, all precursors of the veil breaking. What was it like last time? I wasn't here when it first opened. Bowie and I came later. By then, it was a war zone. Demons were everywhere, spreading death and suffering. Sounds like the apocalypse. Well, yeah. It is. Starts with your typical apocalyptic weather events, this world reacting to the veil fraying. What do you know about this demon? Colconnar? I wasn't on a first name basis with the demons. I was just trying to kill as many as I could get my hands... I won't go with him! I'll never go with him! Leave me alone! I won't go with him! - I'll never go with him! - Who's she talking to? You will submit. You will go to Colconnar willingly. No, I won't! I'd never! Fiji, you okay? Leave me alone. I won't go with him. I'll never go with him. Fiji, wake up. You've been lying this whole time. I know the truth about you, Fiji. You bring death to those you love. Don't say that! That's not true! I don't! You know it's true! You bring death to those you love! Stop saying that! Fiji! Fiji! Fiji? Fiji? You all right? Were you sleepwalking? No. No, it was real. He was real. The man you saw in your dream... Colconnar sent him. Well, maybe it was just a nightmare. I wish. While you were sleepwalking, you kept yelling, "Stop saying that." Stop saying what? He said I'd give myself to Colconnar. That's not gonna happen. Why is he after you? What's he want? I don't know. But I don't want anybody getting hurt because of me. Stop! You are the one who's hurting now. We're taking care of you. The man in your dreams, did he say anything else? No. I'm gonna go make some tea. I leeched her pain. There was a lot. It ran deep. Of course she's emotional. She's being stalked by a demon. So emotional, she almost set us on fire. Colconnar's not the only threat to Fiji. She's a threat to herself, and others. We need to keep an eye on her. I'm not going anywhere. Sun's almost up. I'll be back tonight. So, are he and Olivia better? Well, they haven't talked since the fight. He's sleeping in the back of the pawn shop. So no. If you want, I can call in sick. I'm fine. You barely slept at all. 'Cause I'm not sleepy. And if I get sleepy, I'll take a nap. Are you sure? Mmm-hmm. If there's anything that you need to talk about... No. I'm fine. Okay. See you this afternoon. Still no Starbucks. Oh, my goodness! Fiji! Aunt Mildred. It's been too long! What happened to that little girl who used to visit? Look at you! You're a grown woman. Remember Mr. Snuggly? He's still alive. Hey, be nice, Mr. SnuggleMcCrankyPants. I'm more of a dog person. Welcome. Yay. Make yourself at home. Don't worry, Aunt Mildred. I won't overstay my welcome. Oh, Fiji! Please. Thanks. What is it? What is it? Go on. I want you know I... I'm turning over a new leaf. Just gotta figure out what I want to do next. You know, finish college, get a job. Well, that's why you're here! So you can figure it out. Your mom said you set fire to your hospital room. Yeah, well, I was, um, not taking my meds. I don't really remember it, so... And you broke the windows at college? I was mad. My boyfriend broke up with me, and I lost it. My therapist calls them "rage blackouts." I don't think that's it. I think you're like me. I don't mean a crazy cat lady. I have abilities. And I think you do, too. That you can change the physical world around you with your intentions, or your emotions. I'm a witch. And you are, too. Cool. Xylda left me all my ancestors' demon-killing journals. Are they all in Romanian? I've been using an app to translate, but it's slow going. Okay, so you say that I'm destined to fix this, that I'm the guy with the vision who can bridge the living and the dead. That's the prophecy. Who sealed the veil last time? It didn't hold forever, obviously, but it was a shaman. Catori was his name. Weird guy. Tall. Covered in brands and tattoos. Didn't happen to tell you how he did it? He didn't survive. He went out to the crossroads alone. We found the body a day later. In pieces. Broken and burned. Where was he buried? On sanctified ground. Underneath the Rev's church. Well, let's dig him up. Dead bodies, I can work with. You better work fast. The veil's opening. Frances, here's your chicken. Pork. If you'll excuse us. I will be right back. You need to evacuate the restaurant. There's a sandstorm headed this way. Well, we have a storm cellar underneath. Creek, it's the veil. Rev and Joe are warning everyone in town to go. These people need to leave Midnight. And so do you. You're getting rid of me? You just got to town, and we haven't had a chance to talk, and... And there are demons from hell on the way. Lem, Fiji, Rev, Joe: all supernatural. Olivia, Bobo: they can be just as dangerous, but... I just... I don't want you to get hurt. Well, I don't want you to get hurt either. There's no way I'm letting that happen. You and I, we've got unfinished business. Okay. You fix this, and you call me. I will. Where's Creek? Still with Fiji? No. I told her to evacuate. She's strong. Survived more than most. She doesn't need to survive this. You're complicating it. You love her. Be with her. Thanks for the advice. Manfred better get answers from whatever dead guy he's digging up. And you should have called me last night! Lem was here. I didn't know if you two... I can be in the same room as Lem. Just not giving him the keys. He hurt me. Look at me. I'm covered in silver. I don't know... I hope you two work it out. You and Lem make sense. How are you doing? I'm fine. And I don't need you both here. Livi and I aren't leaving. Well, maybe... Maybe I don't want you here. You ever consider that? Maybe when you told me that you love me and I didn't say it back, maybe it was a hint. I see what you're doing. It's not gonna work. As long as you're in danger, we're not going anywhere. Oh, no! That... You're not ready. That's dark magic. Only to be done when you know what you're doing. Young lady, do not. At least, not yet. Bulbs are dormant in the winter. That's natural. But... When you're a witch, You can change the natural. Wow. How'd you do that? Powers come from our emotions. Make your feelings intentions. Like breaking windows? Let's try to be productive instead of destructive. Give this tulip a little nudge. Think spring and rebirth. Spring. Um... Flowers. Trees. Easter! Hay fever. Mowed lawns. No, not just words. Feel something. Okay. Sun's out, all warm against my skin. The air is sweet with night-blooming jasmine and... Fiji... ...the cool breeze... Fiji, stop! Did I do something wrong? No. No, but be careful. Your emotions, you need to control them. Bobo, Olivia, come here. You okay? He's out there! The man from last night, he's right there. What is it? No, I swear it, he was right out there. Let's go find him. Okay, stay here. Lock the door. There he is! I thought you said he was tall. There wasn't much left of him to bury. No... There has to be something left. Bones, clothes, anything. I'm afraid not. It's been a thousand years. It was a long shot. That was our only shot. What was that? What the hell are those things? Wraiths. Evil spirits heralding the arrival of a demon. Colconnar's coming. Great. So now what do we do? I've been shot twice. Stabbed. Nothing's burned like that. That feels nice. It's my own salve. Worked on it for years. You could have died protecting me. I'm sorry. There's nowhere I'd rather be. At least they're spirits. They can't come into this house. And Colconnar? What about him? He's not spirit. He's alive. Once he rises... We're screwed. She's right. We've got no way to stop them. No way to stop Colconnar. We're sitting ducks. Quite the motivational speaker, aren't you? No, I'm a realist, and my realistic self knows there's only one thing we can do. Get out. So you bail just to come back and tell us all to bail? I'm not saying we bail. I'm saying we get Fiji somewhere safe, we regroup, rethink, come back with a plan to kill the wraiths and Colconnar. Joe and I are gonna go to the garage. Careful. Well, before we leave, I need you to wake up a vampire. Mr. Snuggly, come on! Snuggly, where are you? We'll find him. He hides during storms. I'll look out back. Scat! Don't like cats? He didn't like me first. It's pretty cool what you did here. What'd I do? I know about Mildred being a witch, so I just assumed... Well, don't. You don't know me or anything about me, so... Wait. I... I didn't mean anything by it. I'm a Midnighter. We're good with weird. So if you're a witch, that's cool. Cool? I'm Jeremy. You got a name? It's Fiji. Like the island? Yeah, my parents, they liked to travel, but they didn't have any money, so they named us after places they wanted to go. I like it. Yeah. You do like weird. You two good? No. I'm up in daylight. Walking into the sun. Quit complaining. And move! You enjoying this? Payback? Ha! If this was payback, you'd be naked. And we wouldn't have arranged for the vampire bus. No sunlight. You're welcome. No, no, no. I can't, I can't, I can't leave... Are you crazy? We gotta get you out of here! I can't leave him! Give me your car keys. I'll get him. Okay. The cat carrier's by the door! Yeah, you go. I'll catch up. Mr. Snuggly! I don't want to hear it. What are you doing here? Later! Get in! A state of emergency has been issued for Roca Fria County. Dust storms have been reported throughout the county. If you're in your car and get caught, pull aside to stay alive. That's not an option. I really wish you hadn't come back for me. You stayed to save the cat. No. No. I stayed to make sure Fiji would go. Okay, well, if I hadn't showed up, you and Mr. Snuggly would be dead. Maybe. Probably. Thank you. Yeah. What happened? The cut on your forehead... I crashed the car. It wouldn't start, but just... The fuel pump inertia switch got tripped, but as I was driving off, I started to worry about you guys. I saw that the storm was moving in. I thought, you know, what if you guys had car trouble. Sure. That's why. I was worried about everyone. And you in particular. Dear God, get a room. Wait. What? Who said that? Olivia talked to Manfred. They made it out alive with Snuggly. We're all safe. I hope so. Is there something else? Something you're not telling me? No. In the hospital, they would bring by these little plastic cups of pills. Okay. That sounds fun, actually. No, not at all. You know, I would swallow, and I'd have to endure this mouth check by a very angry nurse, and then as soon as they'd leave the room, I would spit them out. So I got really good at keeping them between my gums and my cheek. That's a skill. Yeah, well... But then, they changed my meds. And one of them was a horse pill, and I got busted. Spent the next month in solitary. Yup, yup. Until I lit my padded room on fire. You could have hurt yourself. I didn't even know how I did it. Just was angry, and... And then, poof. Hey. And they told me that I blacked out doing it. I was terrified. But now, I know I'm not crazy. Just magic. I don't see what the big deal is. The big deal is, you are too powerful. You need to guard your emotions. I don't know him well. You don't know him at all. Please. Protect your heart. - Got clear roads ahead. - Great. I booked a row of rooms at a Knights Inn in Waco. That's a couple of hours away. Guys, behind us. Olivia! It's following us? Creek. Yeah? No pressure, but faster. Okay. We gotta get some distance. Well, we can't outrun it in a tour bus. We need to hole up somewhere without windows, - somewhere nearby. - Where? Take that road. I know the perfect place. Fiji! Fiji! So much for outrunning the storm. It's following us. No. It's me. It's... It's following me. Fij... There's something you're not saying. If you know why the storm is chasing you, it's time you tell us. I don't know why Colconnar's after me. You and I were there, that first time Colconnar showed. He threw me out. Went after you. Grabbed you. Get out of my way. He's been talking to you ever since. Has he told you something? Why he's after you and no one else? I said I don't know! Fij! What is going on? We're all here to protect you. You owe us the truth. What's... I'm a virgin! I'm a virgin witch, a powerful virgin witch, and that is why it wants me. Well, thanks for being honest. I... Yeah. Glad to know the truth. I'm not. What difference does it make? Virgin witches, especially older ones, we're rare. Powerful. That thing wants my magic. Well, it's not getting anywhere near... No, please don't! This is the most embarrassing moment of my life, so if you don't mind, I'm just gonna need a minute. The cat. You left out the best part. They don't need to know. Ooh! Happy three-month-iversary. Thank you. Mmm. Sweet. Yeah? I love you. Did you just say... I love you. Yeah. I love you back. You know I never, you know. Do you want to? Yeah. I... Are you okay? You're so warm. Jeremy? Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy! Feelings. Feelings become intentions. Feelings become intentions. Stop the fire! Stop it! Stop the heat! Stop it! Jeremy, you're not hot anymore. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Think, rebirth. Think, the sun, the sun is out. The flowers bloom, living things are reborn. Living... Fiji. Fiji, what happened? Living things are reborn. Oh, God! What did I do? What did I do? That explains the sweaters. I'm surprised that you came for me. Well, despite what happened, I love you. Lem, you asked me to give you a heads-up. I'm giving you one. As soon as Fiji's safe, I'm leaving Midnight. Because of me. Because of a lot of reasons. I don't feel safe. I never stay in one place too long. I don't want Dad to track me down, and... And I've stayed in Midnight a lot longer than I ever expected. That's because of you. Then... I consider myself fortunate. I've never known anyone like you, Olivia. And so, thank you for letting me spend the last few years with you. Same. Do you want me to leech, for old time's sake? I'm gonna have to get used to dealing without you. No pressure, but do you have any idea how to fix this? Not a one. I can't fix this. Well, I'm gonna choose to believe you can. Don't lose faith. It's not faith, it's fact. Fiji is a lot more powerful than I am, and... And... And leading sometimes means knowing when to delegate. These are some curses my ancestors used. To punish the wicked. To vanquish demons. Here, I, translated what I could. This is very dark magic. Meaning dangerous as hell? Then again, so is Colconnar. Gypsy dark magic, meet witchcraft dark magic. We were getting worried. Might still want to be worried. We combined a curse with an ancient witches' spell to get answers. Problem is, it's black magic. Meaning, it needs a sacrifice. Okay. An eye? Finger? A life. Answers given in exchange for a life. So that's a no. Take me. Don't be ridiculous, Emilio. I'm not. I've taken many lives. We all have. But saving Midnight can be my way of making amends. Everybody, just shut up. Take me. I'm sick of this life. Is that cat talking? He is. I'm really old. My bones ache. I've spent the last seven years without her. I want to see Mildred. You've been by my side for so long... But I never liked you. I know. Give Aunt Mildred a kiss for me. We offer this life for an answer. Hey, why am I not dead? Manfred? Manfred! Manfred! Move! No, no. No-no-no-no-no. This isn't happening. No, no, no, no. He was just supposed to get answers. He can't be dead. No. No, no. Oh, my God. - He's gone. - Oh, my God. No. He can't be dead. Please. No. Don't be dead. He's like ice. I'm just going to stay here... Because I don't believe you're gone. This is magic. And you said to say when I was ready to pick up where we left off. I'm ready. Come back to me. You're the shaman. Cato. Catori. And you are? Manfred. So this is, this is death? This is death. I like it here. It's peaceful. A lot more peaceful than Midnight is at the moment. Is Xylda around? Don't you have a question for me? Yeah. Sorry. How do I close the veil? How'd you know what you said? How? Jeremy? Colconnar sent me because he knew you'd listen to me. I never meant to hurt you. But you did. Come with me, and you will never hurt anyone else you care about. Neither will Colconnar. Go to him willingly, and he'll spare the others. But if you don't, they all die. You can't just die, Manfred. That's not cool of you... Hey! Your heart was stopped. What the hell? Fiji's spell. It worked. You got answers? Yeah. I met the shaman. Where's Fiji? Fiji! She's going to him.
