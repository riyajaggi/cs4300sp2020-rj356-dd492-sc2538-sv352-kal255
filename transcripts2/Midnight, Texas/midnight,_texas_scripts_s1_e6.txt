 VOICEOVER: Previously on Midnight, Texas... JOE: I was an angel. I'm fallen. The veil that Midnight sits upon, it's fraying. I'm speaking to you as a friend. And a reverend who will keep your secret. You don't know, do you? Mr. All-American here, he was once one of us. BOBO: I was 17. - I was ashamed. - I need time. You ever think about leaving Midnight? I'm not leaving my brother here alone with my dad. You know that.

 I know her. That's Aubrey. Aubrey Hamilton. MANFRED: The killer is still out there. You really want to find him, you keep looking. (SCREAMS) Calling all freaks and geeks here for the Midnighters' show! Full moon rising. (LAUGHS) Hey, guys, maybe we shouldn't be so loud. Why? Are you afraid they're gonna get you? - They who? - For one, the werewolves. (BOTH HOWLING) (BOYS LAUGHING) Hey, hey, let's go check out that greenhouse. Could be that witch is growing some dank weed... Excuse me?

 Now scat. We're gonna burn you at the stake, Sabrina the middle-aged bitch! I am not middle-aged. (PAINT SPRAYING) Cherry-popping time, Aerin. AERIN: You know, it's okay. You go ahead. This place kind of creeps me out. (EXCLAIMING) Hey, come on, let's jet. (CHAINS RATTLING) (TIGER ROARS) Yo, I heard that they have parties here where they drink each other's blood and feast on the hearts of children. Sounds delectable. Is that why you're here? Because I'm feeling a little hungry. RYAN: Hurry up, man, let's go! BOY: Come on! Ryan, Ryan! Stop, please, wait for me! Ryan, wait! Ryan, please, wait for me! Ryan, that was... No, please, just come back, and we can... There you are. (CAR APPROACHING) (CRYING) No, please, stop. (SCREAMING) (DEMON SPEAKING) It was just a nightmare. (EXCLAIMING) It's nice... You not having to sneak off in the morning. I could get used to this. What? Are you not in the mood? Not that, I just... I got a headache. You get a lot of headaches. Lately, yeah. Well, maybe you ought to see a doctor. It's not about my health. It's about me being a medium. When I see ghosts, spirits, it can make me feel, like, sick, like a hangover. The more I see, the worse the hangover. Lately, I've been seeing a lot. I do know a foolproof hangover remedy. (SPIRITS SHRIEKING) Good morning, Manfred. How was your night? Good, and yours? Mine wasn't great either. Yeah, full moon last night. My wereself... It's hungry. Every day, I see more and more spirits. Feels like something weird is going on. CREEK: Wow, you're alive. I started to doubt it 'cause you never answer any of my texts. I've been busy covering your shifts at the Gas & Go. That's on Dad. He did not have to fire me. How's it going with you and Dad? You announced that you're hooking up with the town con man. Guess how it's going. I'm not gonna apologize for what I did. Fine, don't apologize, but don't expect me to be excited about it. Thanks. See ya. Whoa, whoa, whoa! What happened? It's not important. Did Dad do that? You left. So please, just... Just leave it alone. Excuse me? My friend was in here last night... Aerin. Her mom called and said that she didn't make it home, and have you seen her? We're pretty worried about her. - I'm sorry, no. - Neither did I. However, I did see my cemetery was vandalized. You weren't here with your friend, were you? No, no, I... I don't know anything about that. Maybe my friend Manfred here could help. He's intuitive. No, stop, stop right there. Don't use that witchy crap on me. It was a mistake asking you people. - "You people"? - He's inconsequential. What is a problem is that there's another missing girl. Hopefully she's just out partying. Yeah, and not lying in a ditch somewhere. Still, we should try and find her. What if something else is going on? Something supernatural? Manfred, you've been seeing an uptick in ghosts, right? Seeing and hearing, everywhere. Psychic energy's off the charts. And I've been finding dead animals and bugs on Witch Light Road. Shouldn't we focus on finding the girl? I'm gonna head out to the ranches. Creek and I'll take the back woods. Bobo, you're with me. FIJI: Rev, you and I can look in town. Don't look too excited. You've known me a long time and... I've always been optimistic, able to see the light in the darkness. And you have a flair for prints. Well, thank you. Lately... I've been failing. It's... It's been hard. I haven't been sleeping. I hear this voice calling me. I feel something touching me. And I have this terrible feeling that it's not gonna stop until it takes me. You were just kidnapped. It's natural that you'd feel a bit shaken. It's not that. I feel like a demon is after me. Or I'm going crazy. You're not going crazy. Are these trees all beginning to look the same? It might look like it, but I know these woods pretty well. Connor and I would explore for hours when we first moved to Midnight. I think my dad is taking out his anger at me on Connor. I saw a bruise on Connor's arm. - Has he ever hit you? - No. Even after Mom died, as messed up as he was, he never laid a finger on us. What is it? Oh, my God! Is that her? No, no. She's been here a while. - (FLIES BUZZING) - It's another girl? Yeah. I think I've met her. If you're here, please make yourself known. Her name's Tiffany. Right. Tiffany. We met on the vampire bus. You were donating blood. She was killed a while ago. Yeah, a lot of things were killed here. Tell me what happened. We need to stop whoever did this to you. Oh, you poor thing, you were just dumped out here like garbage. (SCOFFS) Yeah, she survived a vampire bus for this. I'm not getting anything. Her spirit's not here, it moved on, which is a good thing, the natural order. Spirits that stay are unsettled, unhappy. - This is another Aubrey. - We don't know that. Yeah, I do. Lowry didn't kill Aubrey. I know I didn't. Someone else dragged her body to the river, left her here to die. Same person who did this. Should we call the authorities? In case someone is looking for her... No, Tiffany fell off the grid long before she got to Midnight. We need to find who did this. Deal with it ourselves. Which means what, exactly? We'll decide the punishment when we find out who's doing this. For now, let's just go look for the other girl. Fingers crossed we find her before the cops start digging. LIVINGSTON: You sure you didn't see her? No, but then again, I was down for the night before sunset. Well, that's early. Midnight's a sleepy town. I don't know why folks have to be so disrespectful. It wasn't that long ago Aubrey Lowry went missing. Found her dead by the river. Killed by her husband, as far as I understood. Still an open case until we find him. This girl, her mom's a judge in Davy, and she's scared, so we told her we'd search around. But, in 24 hours, there's gonna be a full investigation. They here about the girl? No sign of her out by the ranches. Fiji thinks she's going mad because she hears demons. Manfred is self-medicating because he sees spirits everywhere. I promised to keep your secret, but the others? They deserve to know they're not going crazy. Nothing I say is gonna stop what's coming. - Eventually, they'll know everything. - When? When demons start crawling out of the veil? I am protecting my family. At the expense of everyone else? I know you sent Chuy away. Why? Because the veil is so dangerous for him here? This is an impossible choice. I wanna help, but if it gets out that there's a fallen angel here, they will come for me, and, believe me, you do not want that in Midnight. But what I can do is keep looking for the girl. That's what I can do to help. OLIVIA: It's pissing me off. I can't figure out if the killer's human or supernatural. Does it make a difference? Not to the victims. Look, Lem's vampire buds said they felt Midnight call to them. Succubus pretty much said the same. It feels like every day we're dealing with a different supernatural coming to town, making noise. - Men can be just as evil. - If not worse. - You talk to Fiji? - I talk to Fiji all the time. She hate me? No, no. She thought you were perfect. She put you on a pedestal. And I fell off. Well, hey, there's nowhere to go but up. Look, she knows what I do for a living. She doesn't like it... She doesn't judge. So don't sweat it. Still hope. So you just wanna check on Connor? I just wanna let him know what's going on. Connor, you here? He'd call you if something was wrong. Yeah, or he'd keep quiet and protect my dad. It's the Lovell way. I'm gonna check out back. (SPIRITS WHISPERING) (SPIRITS SCREAMING) Oh, great. You? What are you doing here? Mr. Lovell, I'm here with Creek. Where is she? Starting early, huh? You come in my house, and I'm supposed to explain myself to you? Are you kidding me? You're hitting him now? - You okay? - I'm fine, yeah. - We're looking for Connor. - Well, he's not here. Just because I'm not here all the time doesn't mean I'm not watching out for him. Get him out of my house. There, I texted Connor. Warned him Dad's hammered. What are you thinking? I'm thinking I should have kept lying. I thought he could handle me having a life, but, boy, was I wrong. - Any luck? - No, we searched the river, fields by the Gas & Go, no luck. Fiji and I searched the town. Well, should we check the road to Davy? Hey, I'm seeing a lot of ghosts these days, so I'm not sure, but... Is someone out there? Connor! Oh, my God, what happened? He's disoriented, might be a concussion. Can I get you anything else? Connor... Um, you remember anything about the person who did this? I... I went looking for the missing girl, and someone hit me from behind. Same thing that happened to Aubrey. Are you sure it was human? What are you talking about? BOBO: What else would it be? - A demon. - (KNOCKS AT DOOR) I called Lem. I'm telling you, there's a demon. I've been hearing it in my house. Manfred saw it too, when I cleansed his place. We banished it back to the other side of the veil. Shouldn't we be getting back to the girl? FIJI: We thought we banished it, but what if that thing is what is doing this? Demons are malevolent beings not of this Earth. The attack on Connor was downright sloppy. Very human. Which means it's very solvable. Wait, wait, there has to be something making me see ghosts everywhere and Fiji see demons and... Rev? Emilio. I'm not here as a man of God. I'm a Midnighter and a friend. I'm doing something wrong for reasons I believe to be right, and I hope you will forgive me, but my conscience will not allow me to remain silent anymore. What's going on, Emilio? You need to know that the veil between hell and Midnight is fraying. Evil energy is seeping out of the veil, affecting all of us and bringing out the darkness in us, as well as drawing evil to Midnight. Why are we just hearing about this now? - I came to you. - I was protecting my source. FIJI: At my expense? There's a demon in my house, clawing me. Wait, clawing you? Are you okay? - Am I? - I don't know. So there is a portal to hell opening in Midnight, a girl missing and cops about to swarm if we don't find her. Connor was attacked over there. I figured maybe I'd get a read on something. What do you think about what the Rev said? I'm curious who gave him the information. I've been wondering why I've been so hungry lately. I'm not getting any readings. I am. (INHALES) I smell blood. (GROANING IN PAIN) You're not going anywhere. She's alive. What happened? Where were you? We found the missing girl. Your father was there with her. He found her? We think he's responsible for Aubrey. For Tiffany. For Connor. I mean, I... We don't know for sure. He's not saying anything. But he was there. Why? - Why... Why would he... - I don't... I don't know. I always wondered what drove a man to move himself, his two children, somewhere so small and isolated. Most people wouldn't bring their families somewhere so remote. But I imagine you loved it. We need to know for sure it's him. I found him with her. LEMUEL: You're gonna tell me how many. How many girls have you killed? You okay? You need to be honest with me about what happened. Dad did this, didn't he? You were protecting him. Manfred and Lem found him with the missing girl. Is she alive? She's in bad shape. But you're okay. You're safe now. I'm gonna take care of you. Where is he? The Midnighters have him now. I will drain you if you don't tell me how many people you've killed. Stop, we're not torturing Creek's father. Why not? He did worse to those victims, to his own son. And he brought law enforcement here. The man has endangered us all. Doesn't mean we can act as judge, jury, and executioner. OLIVIA: Oh, sure, we can. We're gonna do this the Midnighters' way, swift and simple. There's nothing simple about this. This man should be locked away. Or we do to him what we did to the succubus, and Zach and the other vampires. End him. Maybe it's the veil. You said the veil is making people give in to the darkness. - Maybe that's why he's... - The veil can't make someone evil. If he gave in to the darkness, it was already there inside him. Creek is devastated. She needs to know why. Is that why you didn't want me around her? 'Cause you know I see the dead and they tell me things? He's hiding something. Where are you headed? If he won't talk, maybe his victims will. (SPIRITS WHISPERING) (SPIRITS CLAMORING LOUDLY) (FEMALE VOICES SCREAMING) No! No! No! (VOICES STOP) No, she's definitely dead. Is it him? Is he the one who hurt you? I tried to run away. But he found me. You're safe now. I promise. He had a metal pipe. He hit me with it, and I passed out. But when he came back, I was ready for him, and I had a rock. And I hit him with it, hard, and then I just tried to get as far away from him as I could. I gave this to Aubrey. I need to tell Creek. I'll go with you. - You should be in bed. - I can't. I can't even be here in Midnight. I... I feel like I can't breathe. I know, I'm suffocating too. Dad brought us here to hide, keep his secret. I don't feel safe here. Not anymore. I need to go. Be hard not to strangle him with my bare hands. Creek's there. She's been through enough. Let's not make this harder on her than it has to be. I'll restrain myself in front of Creek. Creek? Creek? They're gone. (ON PHONE) This is Creek. Leave a message. Creek, it's me. Call me back. I need to know where you are. Call me. I need to know. Where would Connor go? Where would he take her? I don't know. I really don't. Eventually, we're gonna have to go back. Not yet. I can't face him yet. Me neither. My entire life, I've been living with a murderer. I was too stupid to even know it. It's normal to trust family. SHAWN: Creek never understood why we couldn't have pets, but it wasn't fair to them. It made me sick, but Connor said that it was... Fun. We took him to doctors. They wanted to put him away. I lost my wife. I couldn't lose him too. You put our home in danger. SHAWN: I never meant for that to happen. I'm here because it's isolated. You all, you can protect yourselves from him. How about the ones who couldn't? Like Aubrey, Tiffany? SHAWN: I tried to keep an eye on him. I found out about Aubrey too late. When I heard about the girl gone missing, I went out looking for her. I wanted to find her. He's got Creek. He wouldn't hurt her. You sure about that? I wonder if it started after Mom died. No, I bet he didn't change. I bet he was always wired different. Wired to kill innocent girls? They weren't exactly innocent. What's that supposed to mean? All I'm saying is, Aubrey was a white supremacist. The other girl, she was in the vampire bus. She was with the people that tried to kill us. Why are you defending him? There is no defending what he did. - He hurt you. He hurt them. - (CELL PHONE RINGING) I should just answer. - Just let it go. - He's just gonna keep calling. Hey, Manfred... Connor, what are you doing? Connor! Connor, answer me. I don't know what happened. He must have taken the phone from her. - Connor wouldn't hurt... - Shut up! You lied to us for years. I don't believe a word out of your mouth. He's a killer. That's who he is. It's his nature. She'll figure it out. What happens then, when he feels cornered? Manfred, where are you going? Creek's in danger. I'm not waiting. So you're just gonna get in your RV and start driving? - Yeah, until I find her. - Okay, you go south. - I'll go north. - What? They could be anywhere. It's a lot of ground to cover. Am I supposed to hope that Connor will kill a stranger but not his sister? Or just wait, just until we find her body somewhere? No. My goddess... Joe, what are you doing? I can cover more ground from above. Was I the only one not in the loop? - Nope. - Did not suspect that. Well, that explains a few things. - So he's an... - Angel. Joe is an angel. Connor, it's not Dad, is it? You weren't protecting Dad. He was protecting you. Don't look at me like that. - Like what? - Like I'm a monster. I'm no different from everyone else in Midnight. The Rev, once a month, he... He locks himself away. He makes sure not to hurt anyone else. Lem, he's a predator, like me and Olivia. You forgive them. No, you're wrong. They don't hunt. They don't kill for the sport of it. They do it for justice, to protect people... (SCREAMING) Okay, well, I'm different! I like it. Connor, we can get you help. I don't need you to fix me! Oh, God! You really don't feel bad, do you? (CREEK SCREAMING) - (CAR HONKING) - Stop the car right now! I'm not going back. Don't try and stop me. Connor, you're gonna get us killed! (GASPING) Creek, you all right? It was him. He did it all. We know. - Connor, you need to stop. - He doesn't care. He doesn't wanna change. He killed them all! You're okay. You're safe now. (SOLEMN POP SONG PLAYING) There's no scar. Got a trick or two up my sleeve. You gonna be okay? Yeah. Thanks to you. So you know, the boy who hurt you, he'll never hurt anyone again. We made sure of that. You know what people in Davy think? If they heard what happened here... They'd burn this place to the ground. I won't lie. I'll... I'll tell 'em that I got hurt and an awfully nice group of Midnighters found me. And they took care of me. (CAR APPROACHING) That's my mom. You take care. Thanks. You did a good thing, Fiji. One good thing in an otherwise awful, awful day. (CAR DOORS CLOSING) (CAR ENGINE STARTING) I feel like Midnight will never be okay again. Connor's gone. Can I explain? Explain what? How you made me feel like I had to take care of Connor? Like I had to watch over him? You made me complicit in when he did. I'm so sorry. Please... You're all I have left. You don't have me. You chose to be a father to Connor and to protect all of the evil things that he did. He was my son. What about all of the girls that he killed? There are parents mourning because of him, and you protected him. It didn't matter that other people's children died. We're all that's left. Please. I'm your dad. No, you were his father. You didn't think about me. So this is it. I don't ever want to see you again. I can't. FIJI: Fire destroys. It also cleanses. We honor the spirits that were torn from this life. Let us cleanse the pain... The suffering they experienced. From this hate, let love be found. And from this violence, let peace emerge. Farewell. And blessed be. (SOLEMN SONG PLAYING) Fiji said it would make you feel better. Unless it'll help me forget what happened. I'm sorry. Well... You must be angry with me. No, I'm not. If you hadn't done what you did, I might not have gone after Creek. I think you would have. Maybe... But I used my light to save her, which means they will be coming for me. I should call Chuy and tell him. Thank you, Joe. If you need anything, we're here. You've reached Chuy. Leave me a message. Chuy, it's me. You need to know that it's not safe for you in Midnight anymore. If they find out who you are, they'll kill me, and they will exterminate you, so please, stay away. War is coming here, and I need to stay and fight it.
