 What the hell? What do you want? You saw me miserable, but I was the Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council! The sacred idol! The Demon! MEXICO. AUGUST, 1940. Your keys. Thank you. It was nice to meet you. Wait. What was it?

 You're old enough to know such things. What? No! I wasn't talking about that. I... I saw him at the window. He was talking to himself. Was he hallucinating? Is he going crazy? People like Leon don't go crazy. They just see something we cannot see. We are ordinary people. You know what? Just for a moment today, I thought... I might see it, too. It's not a coincidence, you didn't come home. Hello, Jacson. What are you talking about? It was you who asked Frida to come. Told her to ask him to leave. You just didn't want to disturb them. He doesn't listen to you, but may listen to a young mistress. Tell him, and I will destroy you.

 Now I know why he loves you. Due to the duality of power, the Petrograd Soviet doesn't consider it possible to support any initiatives of the Provisional Government. All workers', soldiers' and sailors' organizations are strictly required to sabotage any orders of the Provisional Government, and Alexander Kerensky in particular. The Petrograd Soviet Chairman, Trotsky. Tell me, will Petrograd Soviet chairman Trotsky... PETROGRAD. OCTOBER, 1917 ...ever master the typewriter? Natalia, you know I don't get along with gadgets very well. Are we expecting someone? Zinaida, Nina. My dear girls! Two young ladies! Natalia, look who came! -Good afternoon. -Lev, Sergei, meet your sisters. Hello. -Hello. -Hello. Aleksandra. Hello, my dearest friend! Hello. Take off your coats. -We'll show you the rooms. -Let's go. This way. Hello. So, you will live with your mother? Yes, not far from here. Just a couple of blocks. We can meet every day. How is Granddad? Probably didn't want to let you go? You bet! Threatened to lock us in. But we insisted. You should have seen what Zinaida did. Of course. It's the revolution in here, life is in full swing. And there are only goats and sheep. And flour grinding day by day. And... Mom came back from exile... Granddad had no chance. It's a family reunion. I've never seen our grandfather. Can you... Do you want to go for a ride around the city? -Do you have a car? -It's not mine. It's for work. But we can go on a sight-seeing tour after my speech. Then we can watch the bridges opening. How about that? -Great! -Shall we see the Winter Palace? Sure. And the Taurid Palace. Even the Peterhof. Put some warm clothes on. Too bad the fountains are off. Enough talking. The pie is ready. Here is the pie... Please, eat the pie, and I have to work. Lev, Sergei, girls. Good morning, Frank. The door was open. I need to wash myself. Damn. You are an interesting woman, Frida. With all your free love thing... Your paintings... Primitivism... Scandalous behavior. Fixation on death. You know what is most interesting for me? -Why are you here? -You know Leon is attached to you? Nonsense. Leon is not attached to anyone. People have always been for him a construction material of history. But you are not just a man to him. You are much more. The judge. What did you see there? You see? It's the monarch butterfly. In spring and summer, they live for only a few days. For those of them born in autumn, God gives seven months of life. They spend winter in warm countries and preserve their kind. Isn't it funny? And unfair. Leon knows he won't survive the winter, Frank. After all, why are you here? To ask you to be a merciful judge, Frank. Damn, you are crazy. Those not planning to live long rarely deny themselves carnal pleasures. You talk about death even after sex? Sex and death have much in common. Want some? No, I don't like to intoxicate my brain. It's not for the brain, Frank, but for relieving pain. Is everything about pain for you artists? I was 18 when I had an accident. The bus I took collided with a tram. My leg was broken in 11 places. I had broken ribs, collarbone, and backbone in three places. And the rail of that bus ripped me like a skewer. It went out here, breaking all the pelvic bones. Isn't it stupid? Losing my virginity to a bus rail... It's not a game, Frank. I'm 33, and almost half of my life it hurts. Physically. And I will never have children. -Better tell me about Trotsky. -What for? You can ask him anything yourself. You asked me to be a merciful judge. The judge has the right to interrogate witnesses. Fine. What do you want to know? -How we became lovers? -No. It's not interesting. Tell me about his children. He really didn't love them at all, did he? Leon has never been a good father. But it doesn't mean he neglected his kids. His human part cared about them. I can't believe it. So many people came to listen to our dad. Do you remember how we saw Chaliapin in our childhood? It seems there were fewer people at the concert. You're a fool, Nina. Who is Chaliapin? A singer. And we have the revolution! Fedor, you look at those girls... Comrade Chairman, sign the order for weapons to workers. Kerensky forbade it, but ordered to disarm the Peter and Paul Fortress! And what does it mean? To give all the weapons to the Cossacks! Goddamn dual power! I wish Lenin were here! Vladimir Lenin prefers to hide in a safe house and write letters. What? And we heard he was abroad... I'm sure Comrade Koba could tell us where Comrade Lenin blends in. Dad! -We're here! -Dad, we're here! My girls! Isn't the revolution scary? Why should we be afraid, when Comrade Trotsky is with us? Dad, are we going for a ride? Sure, I've promised you. Leon, we will be late. Wait for me after the speech and we will go. Yes. Who rules the minds, rules the world. Today our minds are ruled by the revolution. Just a little bit, brothers! Sisters, just a little bit and the world will change forever! Hooray! Hooray! But... what do the toiling masses see at the moment? Firstly, they see the complete disorganization of the state, and secondly, the incessant robbery of the people by the capitalists. And in this situation, every worker has a psychological right to say to himself, if the country is still falling apart and capitalists are still robbing us, why should I remain silent? I will make as many demands as I can and I will take what I can. And this is an inevitable result of the state of things. But is this the result we all want? -No! -Down with the power! Down! Enough! We're done! Enough! Believe me, on that day, on that hour, when the country is ruled by such a power, in which each and every worker will see the expression of his own will, he will say, "Yes. This power will not deceive me, will not steal from me." And on this day and hour, a new state will appear. The State of Justice. Hooray! Unfortunately, there are still random people in the revolution, mediocre people, solving with its help their personal low-lying tasks. They tell us: "It's not time yet." They tell us, everything will happen naturally. I say, "No." I say, "Now... Or never." Hooray! Down with Kerensky! Hooray! Trotsky, brother, have a drink with us! -Thank you. -Dad! Dad! Tell him I will not sign this. Let him manage on his own. And no negotiations with Kerensky. Good speech, Comrade Trotsky. I remembered. I have no time to talk with you, Comrade Koba. -Someone is waiting for me. -And with Lenin? Do not be afraid, Comrade Trotsky. This is Comrade Lenin's personal guard. Why the cheap spy fiction, Koba? Where is Vladimir Lenin? Let's go. Fire! Where is Dad? How could he forget? Stop whining. He'll come back, I know. Nina! Nina! Bravo, Vladimir. Masking, personal guard, you definitely read too many new-fashioned spy novels. Your irony is not appropriate, Trotsky. It was you who did everything to force me to run, and you took over my party. -This is not your party. -Is that so? I wonder, whose? Is it not yours? This is the party of the working people. Nina! Wait! Nina! Nina! Nina! No! Nina! Nina! Have you ever asked yourself what comes after? -After? -After. Imagine, the revolution is accomplished. The power is with the Bolsheviks. The country is devastated. A civil war is inevitable. I'm not afraid of it. Yes, yes. Yes, I know. But when the euphoria of the revolution is over, how long will the Russian God-loving people tolerate a Jew as its leader? Trotsky, you have two choices. Either get over it and follow me, or get out, there will be no compromise. Show your discretion now. Then you will be busy and important. You will become the second person in the party. Think about it. What if I refuse? You would be just swept away like Kerensky. Your life is not worth a farthing. You know... I've thought it over. Go to hell, Comrade Lenin. Zinaida? Did something happen? I just wanted to ask, have you ever thought about us? I am sorry... It is such a moment... So many things are going on... You did not answer. I had a very important conversation. What? A conversation... While you had a conversation, Nina was almost trampled to death. Goodbye. Frank, do you remember? Be gentle with him. Please. I'll try. Hello, Comrade Trotsky. You know what a father feels, when his children die? He turns into a beast. Capable only of howling at the moon. Then, gradually, this beast comes out of you and the human part returns. But with... a hole inside. However, still thinking. This is the worst, because... when there are no thoughts, you just howl. It is easier. And here they are... They appear. Those obsessive, killing thoughts. Why were they born if they are gone before you? For what purpose? It cannot be like that. It just can't... It eats you from the inside. Sounds in your head 24 hours a day. Jukeboxes break that way. They loop the same record a million times. You're trying to stop it, but it's impossible. All the time the same melody. The same. I tried to hate you... But I don't feel hatred. Only pity. You never had children. You do not even know what I'm talking about. What a moralist. It's a pity... -I just wanted you... -Want to be sorry for someone? Be sorry for Sylvia. The poor girl is waiting when you ask her to marry you. While you are lying in bed with Frida. What? You thought I did not know? Frida told me that she was going to have breakfast with you. Believe me, I know what "a breakfast with Frida" means. Yes, you are right, I have no children. And maybe I won't have any. But I know there is nothing worse than children suffering because of a father who thinks he's a messiah. And yes, I'm sorry for you. Pity is the only thing you got at the set of life. -Do not touch me! -Why are you doing this to me? Sorry. This interview is driving me crazy. You don't visit me, I almost forgot when we slept together last... I'm not myself these days, he is the devil. He sucks my soul drop by drop. I can't sleep at night. I take sleeping pills and still don't sleep. I do not recognize you, you've changed. I'm afraid of you. Let's go to my place. Let's go. Come on! -I can't. Sylvia, don't... -Let's go. I have to finish this job! Maybe it's better to tell her about you and Frida? You do not love Sylvia. And there is such an excuse to throw off the ballast. Tell me more about your ballast. Comrade Trotsky. Why did you give up power when you already had it? Why do you think so? I did not give up anything. OCTOBER 25, 1917 THE ADMIRALTY. THE TELEGRAPH. THE FINLYANDSKY STATION. THE "RABOCHY PUT" NEWSPAPER. THE POWER PLANT. THE WINTER PALACE Comrade Trotsky, Kamenev called. He asked if you are to gather everyone here. Yes. We are doing it today. Doing what? The revolution. GRIGORY ZINOVIEV A REVOLUTIONARY Wait. Lenin spoke about the 27th, today is the 25th. We are doing it today. Gather the sailors. I have bad news, it's the Spanish flu. The virus is new, not yet studied. The mortality rate is 20%. Trotsky, listen, we can't. LEV KAMENEV A REVOLUTIONARY You are the Chairman of the Petrograd Soviet. You can't force us to choose between you and Lenin. Lenin. And where is your Lenin? Where is he? Damn it! Huh? No. He is not here. Fiction... Oh, letters, in the hands of the Georgian. Here's your Lenin. And you continue to blindly obey him. Natalia, when will Dad come home? I don't know. He's spent all week in the Petrograd Soviet. -I'll go get him. -Zinaida, wait! Natalia. I need a bowl of cold water. -Where are you going? -You are not going out there alone. Now you are here, you are the leader, but Lenin created our party. He led us to what we have. He led us over ten years. How long have you been a Bolshevik? -Six months. -Six months. You may become a part of history together with me today, or you will be on its roadside tomorrow. It's your choice. By forces of the Keksholmski Regiment take the Central Post Office. Trotsky. Act according to the plan. Report to me every 30 minutes. The 6th Battalion to take the Nicholaevsky Railway Station. Trotsky. CENTRAL POST OFFICE THE NICHOLAEVSKY RAILWAY STATION Sailors of the Guard Fleet to take the State Bank. Trotsky. BANK TELEPHONE EXCHANGE STATION To arrest the Provisional Government. Trotsky. Who's provisional here? Get up! Kerensky ran away, the Provisional Government was arrested. -Some people still resist, but... -Any losses? -Twenty people. -Only 20? -You don't seem to be happy... -Well, no. I'm glad... A kike from a small town... Had his mare down... He went to a rabbi For a piece of blabber... Trotsky, are you all right? Zinoviev, has anyone ever told you, the expectation of happiness is the real happiness? -What? -When you live with a dream, it gives you strength, great strength. When you make your dream come true, what should you live for? -Have you ever thought about it? -No. -Dad. -Why are you here so late? Sergei is very ill. He has Spanish flu. -What? -He feels bad. He may even die. The doctor said the mortality rate is 20%. I see. I'll be back in two hours. Gather them all, we should announce our victory. How to make the mare work... Let's go. What have you done, Trotsky?! The revolution, Comrade Lenin. -This? -This is not a revolution, it is a coup! This is a bank robbery, we are not in America, damn you! Take the car, take my children home, and then come back for me. Consider it done. -So... -Please, come home. Hello. Yes, it was a coup. But you will call it the revolution, anyway. If you want to save face. You will need it. You were right, Vladimir, Russia will never recognize a Jew as the leader. Never. But the revolution should have a leader. The choice is yours. I almost forgot... It's your birthday today, Trotsky. Congratulations. Thank you. Comrades! Comrades! Comrades! The revolution of the workers and peasants which the Bolsheviks have spoken about all the time, is accomplished! The floor is given to Comrade Trotsky. Trotsky! Trotsky! Trotsky! Trotsky! Trotsky! Comrades! We have dreamed of this for many days. And today our dream has come true. The proletarian revolution has won! And this revolution was carried out by the Bolshevik Party. Recently Vladimir Lenin did not often go to the Petrograd Soviet. He withdrew from his work. So it may seem at first sight. But it's not like that, comrades. We owe the victory of the proletarian revolution, first of all to this man. It was he who developed the plan for the revolution. Revolutionary sailors and soldiers followed his orders. He led the uprising! Glory to Lenin! Leader of the Bolshevik Party! Glory to Lenin! Natalia. Natalia. Have you heard?! Damn it, we did it! We won! Congratulations. Happy birthday, darling. How is Sergei? -Much better now. -What? You had been going after your dream for 20 years. Despising principles, drowning everyone in the way. Then you just easily handed all the power over to your opponent? What for? A Jewish leader wouldn't have ruled for a month in Russia. For the power, Lenin would split the party. And one by one we were doomed. Power has never been my goal. Next to Lenin, as a part of the ruling party, I could go on with my true and sole purpose. Yes, I know. "To blow the fire of the world revolution." And becoming the dictator of Russia, I would fetter my hands. The path to victory does not always mean going forward. We must be able to maneuver. Just stop and wait. Nonsense. Don't you disgust yourself? Look at you. You're some kind of a demagogue! A weak man! You aren't clever enough to set apart the real policy and demagogy. I do not believe you. You forced your family to suffer for the sake of revolution, and then put this revolution aside. Scared of responsibility. Your family suffered in vain. Your son could die in vain without seeing his father! He died anyway. They all died. NINA 1902-1928 Dad. SERGEI 1908-1937 ZINAIDA 1901-1933 I'M DYING OF DESPAIR LEV 1906-1938 So early? Do we have an occasion? Here it is. We have a new frame. Here. Dad! We still love you. You're our dad. Come here. My dear children...
