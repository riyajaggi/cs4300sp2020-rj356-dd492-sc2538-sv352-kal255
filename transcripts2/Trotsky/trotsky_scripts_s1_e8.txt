 Oh, damn. It's you. He's not very pleased. And when he's not... I need more time! It must happen today. Did you hear me? It must happen today. Yes. RAMÃ“N MERCADER NKVD AGENT -Frank. -Come on in. Hello. I'm sorry but no interviews today. -What happened? -Leon had a heart attack.

 He's fine now. But he needs rest. I hope everything will be alright. Frank! I was waiting for you! Come on in! What's the hold up? We don't have much time! I feel great, Natalia. Jacson, do you sleep at all? Barely. Why? Nightmares. How are you? Better than these doctors say. How much time did he give me? A year? A half? Or less? Never listen to any doctor.

 They just deceive you. Maybe you should rest today? We could go to the lake. Don't you worry, Natalia. Besides, we're almost done. Right, Frank? -Yes. -That's good. Let's not waste any more time. Well. Let's start. What's your brightest childhood memory? Ah! Let me think. I was about four years old. Walking in a garden with my nanny. She was a lady-cook's daughter. She saw a water snake and beat it with a stick. Turned out it was a viper. Nanny ran away, I couldn't. I was literally numb because of fear. I couldn't do anything. As if my legs were stone. Fortunately, the snake didn't bite me. It went away. What about the moment when you found out about the victory? Do you remember it? I sure do. I remember it clearly. I received a telegram from Tukhachevsky. He was dealing with Antonov, our last real opponent. I still remember the words. The rebellion was exterminated. Stop. The Soviet regime is established everywhere. Stop. RUSSIA. JULY 16, 1921. ...ESTABLISHED EVERYWHERE... This is a historical moment, Sermuks. Remember it. I want to speak to the people. Telegraph the nearest station. Gather everyone. Civilians, soldiers: everyone. LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTIONARY TERROR! We gathered everyone we found. THE ENEMIES OF THE WORKERS ARE DESTROYED VICTORY! PEACE! THE HYDRA IS FINISHED! LONG LIVE THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION FORWARD TO THE WORLD REVOLUTION! MOSCOW. 1921. -Spare a coin. -I have nothing. I haven't eaten for three days. I'm dying. Spare something. Sorry, I really don't have anything. SUMMERHOUSE OF MAXIM GORKY. 1921. -Please, forgive me. -It's fine. Thank you. PHYSICS COURSE BOOK So you study physics in your spare time? I don't study. I'm interested. I want to get to the bottom of it. To know how it works. That is the difference between you and our modern rulers. They think that they already know everything. They cut the reality to fit the theory. Who do you mean? Do you know who Gorky is talking to? Leon, in Russia, 30 million people suffer from hunger. Poor people suffer the most. The people for the sake of whom we're making these great social changes. The government is making every possible effort. I mean people. A friend of mine, professor Prokopovich, is a famous economist. He suggested we organize the charity fund for the starving. I don't think you'd be able to raise a lot of money. Whom will you ask? There's no money in the country. He seems to really feel godlike. He wants to change both social and economical laws. Why do you think he won't succeed? He's achieved everything so far. If you really want to know how everything works, you should enroll in the Higher Technological University. -I study there. -Really? -Mech and Maths. -I teach there. Economics. Sergei Prokopovich. -Sedov. Lev Sedov. -Nice to meet you. We are widely known in the West. And you should agree that their funds could be crucial. We'd buy food abroad and send it to the poorest regions. But it won't happen without your help! I get it. Anything else? I met Block the other day. He's severely ill. Doctors that could help him are no longer here. He needs to be sent to Finland but... the GPU doesn't allow it. After the personal order from Dzerzhinsky. I'll set up this question. Thank you, thank you, Leon. I believed in you. I agree with professor Prokopovich. America has a bumper crop. They burn their extra grain. They feed pigs with milk. They'd be glad to sell some to us. What about the political consequences? We'll seem vulnerable. Doesn't matter. If it helps to deal with the famine, we'll deal with the West anyway. You think we should take anything from the Western upper-classes? Sharing with the poor is the right thing. But if it is charity, it will be humiliating, that's true. We should pay or we would seem inconsistent in front of people. Common folks don't care about consistency. -They're dying. -We should use it then. Right now. When they eat human flesh, we can confiscate church valuables. We'll sell them. We'll meet some resistance. I hope so. The more priests we shoot, the better. I'm talking about peasants. Don't overestimate their value. Unlike us, the village is weak. We have to use it. So, comrades... If that's it... Comrade Lenin, I sent you a note. About Block and Gumilev. Have you read it? Block is a counterrevolutionary. We cannot let him leave the country. We don't know what to expect and what ideas he would spread. What are you afraid of, Felix? Squibs? Wanton aggression against poets would demonstrate our weakness. Wanton? Do you doubt the work that the GPU does? -I... -Enough! Forgive me. I don't feel well. Let's continue this later. -Leon. -Yes? Would you stay for a moment? -I don't know how much time I have. -Vladimir. Spare me your wicked pity, Trotsky. We've never been friends. But we know how to tell each other the truth. It's worth more than any friendship. Let's be clear. I must be sure that my life's work will continue by the right people after I die. Stalin is rude. He's not smart. He wants to lead. You, on the other hand, turned the whole party against you. Tell me, are you able to damp your ardour? To stop turning Dzerzhinsky against you? We need him. If I agree, what should I do next? Comrade Dzerzhinsky. Let's start. Any economic theory should be based on historical research. Professor Prokopovich? Come with us. I'm working. Allow me to finish. Oh, it's fine. What are you doing? Leave him alone! Quiet! I'll come for you too. Father. I've never asked you for anything. I took my mother's last name to make my own way. If your professor is innocent, they'll free him. -Please, help. -We've discussed it. Can you imagine him being an enemy? I believe in the GPU officers. I won't explain anything. And I won't make excuses. Leon Jr. is right. What? We've got our archivist arrested. He's 70. The Moscow intelligentsia is being persecuted. Writers, poets. -They're not terrorists. -Enough! Greetings, Leon. In case you are too busy to get the news, I'll tell you. Block died three weeks ago. Gumilev was shot yesterday. I don't blame you for their deaths. We are all guilty. We created a Moloch to destroy the enemy. We brought it up and fed it with the blood of victims. Now the enemies are defeated but it's still hungry. It doesn't care whether it deals with a friend or a foe, guilty or innocent. It's hungry. It wants ever more blood. It started with poets, because they are weak. But it'll grow teeth and get to the mightier prey. You defeated the oppressor. Don't become one. Show some mercy. Maxim Gorky. You were the second man in the government. Why wouldn't you stop it? The civil war was over. But the upcoming world revolution was still ahead. The most important battle for minds was yet to be won. You always justify violence by extreme circumstances. In reality you sent thousands of innocents to death row. How can you justify that? It was all for the future victory. Sometimes you have a setback. Yes, I sacrificed them all. But as a result I saved a lot more. -When? -At the plenary meeting. We'll stand against him together. He'll be expelled. Stalin won't give up easily. GORKI. 1922 Why, of course. He'll try to rebel. But with whom? People don't know him. All he could possibly get will be Dzerzhinsky and the Cheka. In that case I'll raise the army to the defense of the revolution. And destroy everything we fought for? Another civil war will wipe the country out. Do you want to rule over a desert? Dzerzhinsky went too far. There's no more need for terror. Yet jails are packed with prisoners. He doesn't even arrest the real enemies! He prefers professors! Poets first, professors now... Calm down, Leon. We're deciding the fate of the country. And the revolution. You think about some intellectuals. -Are you all right? -Don't pity me! Don't pity anyone! You should be... -Vladimir! -...strong and ruthless. It's the way to win! Nadezhda, I'm fine. I can see how fine you are. You should be resting, not working! Don't encourage him, Leon! -I called him! -I'll see him off. Please. Leave. Trotsky. Did you hear me? I did. Yes. Please rest. The front office, Fotieva. Oh, Lydia. Stalin. -Good day, Joseph. -Good day. Let me speak to Vladimir. -He went out for a walk. -Alone? With Leon, I think. Would you like to leave a message? Don't bother. Thank you, Lydia. SUBPOENA GPU HEADQUARTERS. MOSCOW, LUBYANKA. 1922. What a gesture. Comrade Ilyin. Have a seat. We have to chase your colleagues. But you came willingly. Quick understanding. I find it impossible to hide forever. Allow me to know the charges. -Does it matter? -But still. A refusal to cooperate with the Soviet regime. I didn't refuse to cooperate with your regime. "Your"? Isn't it also yours, Comrade Ilyin? Haven't we given you freedom from the slavery? You indeed gave people freedom of another kind. Freedom from clemency. Do you know how this building is known? The ship of the dead. Well... Welcome aboard. The restrictions to free speech are choking the system of independent education. As a result of arrests and chasing teaching staff of colleges and universities, we declare our total ongoing strike. We suggest to all of you, both students and professors, to everyone who cares about education in Russia, to join us. Down with the new tyrants! Down with the new tsars! -Down with the new tyrants! -Down with the new tyrants! -Down with the new tsars! -Down with the new tsars! -Down with the new tyrants! -Down with the new tyrants! Down with the new tsars! -Thank you, commissar. -No big deal, Comrade Trotsky. I understand. Youthful indiscretions. We've all been there. -I didn't make a report. -Thank you once again. Good bye. Let's go. What do you think you're doing? The thing you should do. Fighting for justice. What do you know about justice, boy? -Leon. -Don't interrupt. I'm talking to my son. You know my enemies would use that. You're stabbing me in the back. Destroying what I've created! What do you create? A bright future? Who would you lead if you destroy all nonconformists? A bunch of mindless slaves? I don't want that future. You're not a revolutionary! You're a liar, an executioner and an usurper! You're the worst! I loved you. You were my everything. But now I see your true self. And fear for your little world. I hate you. I don't want to see you. -Leon Jr.! -Let him be. Let him leave. Which one of them is most reputable? -Ilyin. -Charges? We don't lock up for no reason. -Answer. -Counterrevolutionary behavior. -Which is? -We're working on it. -Let me talk to him. -It's a waste of time. Yes, sir. -Do you know who I am? -Yes. Good. Straight to the point then. We want to terminate the inner dissidence, which is supported by you and your kind. But I want to give you a chance to avoid punishment. In return you'll have to... prove your loyalty. We need a collective letter, signed by your colleagues, with the public recognition of the Soviet regime. We need you. Your brain, your knowledge. We have to rebuild this country and make it the greatest one. In return you'll be provided with good living conditions for you and your families. It's impossible, I'm afraid. Why so? You're a liar, a thief, a murderer. What you call freedom... It's the greatest slavery. You killed more Russians than any previous war did. -And you ask me why? -You know what? Stop wringing your hands. You lost. Look into the future. The future... Your future is here. It's in these walls, look at this. All your achievements are the result of pain and fear. You force out the assurances of loyalty from your people by torture. Your stunts don't bother me. But it seems that you're quite honest in your motives. If we are the devil incarnate, why did the people support us? You were supported by the lowly. Not the people. Your revolution is in fact a criminal seizure of power. Others were frightened or tempted. Ideas of Heaven on earth... It's a trick of Satan. We were simply proclaiming justice. Your heaven is the Russian Empire of 1913. Tell them about it. Tell starving peasants and laborers, whom you controlled by bottle and ignorance. Tell Jews about it. They weren't allowed to live next to you. The world you destroyed... It wasn't perfect. It had its scum. But you... You've turned everyone into scum. You're either an executioner or an adoring slave. Your revolution is a profanity. A violent profanity. You rule with fear. It won't last long. If the people don't bring you down, you'll cut each other's throats. I see. Will you sign the letter? -No. -No? Very well. If you're so willing to die, it's up to you. But you send your colleagues to death too. No. You send them to death. KREMLIN. 1922. Professors' strike... It's like the Kronstadt rebellion. But with books instead of weapons and not on the battlefield. So I suggest we treat it in the same way. Stamp out the riot, not caring about expenses. We've arrested the most dangerous conspirators. Sixty-three of them. Their execution will sober up remaining professors and students. Others will be next in line. Until when? Excuse me? It's a doubt. Nothing but a normal thing. Only fools don't doubt. Neither do sneaks. If we continue to destroy the dissidents, what will that leave us with? I think Leon knows as well as we all do that these professors are ideological enemies. We can't endlessly turn a blind eye to their counterrevolutionary activities. True. But there is no reason to execute them. They took part in a conspiracy! Which was made up. By you. The whole conspiracy is a refusal to work in these conditions. By execution of the world-famous intellectuals, we'll push away the Western ones. A lot of them support us for now. Which means: no credits, no technology, no specialists. Without them, our industrialization will fail. Do you suggest we eat from the hands of the West? We will, if it helps us to surpass them. We are weak, forget about pride for now. We have to learn what they can teach. Ilyin. Out. Gentlemen. I assume my time has come. Farewell. Farewell. Hurry up, why so slow! Violence was justified during the war. Fear and repression are tools of a weak authority. Mercy, however, is a right of a winner. A privilege. Of a winner. By showing mercy, we show the world that we won. We are confident. We aren't afraid of the resistance. -I get it but... -Comrade Lenin... One moment. What do you actually suggest? That we tolerate their endless attacks? No. We can send them away as unwanted citizens. That would be a present. They'll continue their counterrevolution. It already exists there. The West is swarming with our enemies. Professors will just join them. But what we gain from that... It's a lot more. -What about losses? -Let him speak. So, what do we gain? People. The ones that don't believe us. For now. We'll show them that we're not afraid. You can bark but not here. Get out. We'll do without you. This is either a sign of stupidity or sheer counterrevolution. Felix, I think everyone gets both opinions. Let's vote. Only the Politburo members are voting. Felix, please abstain. So. Who is for Comrade Stalin's proposal? Sign. -I told you I won't... -Sign. Who is for Comrade Trotsky's proposal? Sign. You won't return to Russia upon the penalty of death, if you're set free. If the accused signs an agreement of leaving at his expense he will be set free on the condition of leaving the USSR in five days. Otherwise, he will be put in the special department. And then sent to hard labor. You heard that. Four votes against three. Trotsky wins. Felix, I'd like you to prepare the most dangerous elements for transportation abroad. Let's clean Russia. Leon. Mother told me everything... Dad, I... Karsavin! Lossky! Trubetskoy! Prokopovich! Frank! Berdyaev! Vysheslavtsev! Kiesewetter! It's not what you wanted. I know that. But they'll live on. Maybe they will return. When I fix everything here. Ilyin. Bakkal! Novikov! Yasinsky! Ugrimov! Tsvetkov! Metelsky! Protazanovsky! Sibirsky! GORKI. 1922. Vladimir, you should go to bed. You should rest. I don't need rest. It'll send me to the grave. -Don't say that! -You know what I mean. I feel good, really. We're almost done. In five minutes. Nadezhda, I swear. -I hope you're honest. -Go, dear. Thank you. We were exposed too early. Vladimir, we shouldn't let fear lead us. We've lost Dzerzhinsky, but most of the Politburo is ours. We'll be stronger at the plenum. We'll have to use my authority and your energy. Yes. It is time for a show-down. Tomorrow I'll be first to make a speech. Then Stalin, then you. I'll strike him first. Throw him off. He won't be able to react. He's a bad improviser. He'll mumble. Then you'll finish him! After such a beating in front of the party, he'll lose his authority. -Have you read it? -Short and deadly. Yes? I've never felt more alive. Lydia, here. Make a copy. I want a fight. Put me through to Stalin. Leon, an urgent telegram from the Kremlin. What happened? Read. Vladimir had a stroke. He's paralyzed, can't speak. The members of the Politburo decided in your absence not to cancel the plenum. Call it whatever you like. You lost. When you look forward, there's no time left... No time to turn around. It allows you to be stabbed in the back. Yes, Natalia? There's a courier from the Canadian embassy. He says that it's urgent. He has a letter for you. After that attempt, the Mexicans made an inquiry about the foreigners who were there. Jacson is not who we think he is. -I'll call the guards. -Don't. We knew that this day was about to come. No. -Please, I beg you. -Hush, quiet. I made my decision. It will be better this way. Trust me. Farewell. I love you. I've always loved you and only you. I know. I loved you too. I love you. Continue? Sure! After the stroke, Lenin retired. I was on my own. Like in a vacuum. Stalin put his men everywhere. That new kind of people with empty eyes. They were ready to obey any command of their Leader. And then it was over. As you know, the opposition led by Trotsky was agitating against Lenin. Keep calm. Trotsky can't be a communist! He is a speculator by his very Jewish nature. It's not a surprise that nowadays he's against Lenin's closest successor, Comrade Stalin. He doesn't believe in Russian socialism for he doesn't believe in the power of the Russians! Shoot him! Are you ready? Wait! Go no further! Let's go. Dad! Dad! People! It's Leon Trotsky! It's an outrage! Why are you silent? Trotsky's behavior was considered open counterrevolution. The party decided to send him away from the territory of the USSR. The last question. If you had an opportunity to go back... -To Russia? -To the past. If all that way had been ahead of you, what would you have changed? Nothing. What about your children? Father, friends... All the loyalists and victims? You didn't get a thing. You're stuck with details. I changed the world. No, no, you made an attempt. But you failed. You ended up here. Leading a life of fear and hatred. It will get worse. You will be rotting. You'll tell yourself you were right. But you won't believe it. Even suicide won't save you. Because it would be a signature of failure. Good bye, Trotsky. Jacson. Remember what I said about us being similar? Forget it. You're different. You're a coward. You have no strength to finish what you are supposed to do. I don't even mention the will to break the rules you were given. You ask me if I want to return? Oh, I will. But not in the past. In the future. I left the seeds. They will grow. Through the blood and pain I showed people a new world. They won't ask for the old one. Never. I set the world aflame. Can you smell it? That smell... Ashes. I regret not being consistent or cruel enough. I was soft where a firm hand was needed. I stepped back when I had to go forward. Without thinking about losses. But this world is already burning in the flames of a new war. Who knows what it will bring? Where would your Stalin be? I feel powerful! I feel the power. I'm ready to return. I'm ready! This war... It's a purifying fire! It hides a new fair world! My ideas are immortal. It means I am immortal. The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble. Book of Proverbs 4:19 LEON TROTSKY
