 - Hey, guys! - Yeah, Steven? You guys should take this online quiz I found. It tells you what... It tells you what character you are - from "Crying Breakfast Friends"! - Eh... why? It's just fun to see yourself as a cartoon character. Like weeping eggcup, who's neurotic and uptight, or pining grapefruit, the sensitive older one who wishes he was a better role model. Uh, maybe we can do that thing after we've fixed the van. Okay. I'll go find someone else! Do you understand that cartoon show? I don't understand anything anymore. Hey, Steven. Is there any more engine oil?

 I need it for this sandwich. - I...think that's for cars. - Well, is there any more of it? Dad's probably got some outside. Oh! But, uh, you got to take this online quiz. - Which Crying Breakfast Friend are you? - That show's really weird. Who wants to watch a cartoon about people crying? - I do! - Okay, okay! Uh... what's the first question? - Do you ever act without thinking? - Nope. Never. Are you afraid of taking risks and trying new things? Terrified. Amethyst, are you taking this seriously? - Of course I am. - Okay. Are you insecure about your relationships and how you're perceived by other people? N-N-No... Yes? Eh... - What's the right answer? - There is no right answer. You're just supposed to answer honestly. - Nah, I'm bored. - Wait ... I have loads more probing, personal questions to ask! Garnet! W-What are you doing in my room? I saw a corrupted gem. I followed it through the tunnel it dug in the rock. - Yeah, right. - Where did it come from? It's similar to Pearl's description of the creature she saw slinking through the temple. - You saw the Slinker?! - I thought we agreed there was no Slinker and that we weren't going to call it "the Slinker". Yes, we did. But now it's undeniable the creature exists - and that Steven's name stuck. - Yes! No! Look, why don't you just let me look for it? Because you won't. - How long's this thing been in here? - Ah! Look, Steven! I'm a pachyderm! Oh!  And there's a prize inside! Shhh! Keep quiet. Oh, Garnet. Stern but practical. Just like spilt milk. You're not still on about that dumb cartoon, are you? Oh, right ... the quiz! Do you get defensive when people ask you questions about the feelings you prefer to keep hidden? Don't get all psycho-logical on me, Steven. Uh... sorry? There! Whoa, mama! Did you get it?! No. Aw, man! I think my favorite round thing was in there. I'll get you a new round thing. Ugh! This is my stuff you're messing with! If it's gonna get ... Ugh! ... wrecked, I'm gonna be the one to wreck it! See?! That's how it's do... Amethyst got poofed! Slinker! G-G-G-Garnet? Steven, remember ... our bodies are only an illusion. Amethyst will be fine. B-B-But Pearl took two whole weeks to come back. And I already miss Amethyst so much! Don't worry. She'll be back before you know it. Literally. Amethyst's back! Amethyst's back! - Ugh. Huh? - Looks like you... grew a few feet since the last time I saw you! Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! That was fast. Even for you. Eh! It's no big deal. I didn't want to keep my biggest fan waiting. Ugh! Hmm. Okay, okay! We got a Slinker to slink! Wa-ugh! Hmm. Where would I go if I was a monster? Hey! Over here. - Your new form is really interesting. - Thanks, Steven. I didn't even know you could come back this different. - Thanks, Steven. - So, why'd you come back with four legs? - 'Cause I like walking! - Wow. I want four legs, too! No, you don't. Amethyst rushed her regeneration. - She should have taken her time. - Like Pearl? Yes. Pearl put a bit more... thought into how she came back. Pearl, Pearl, Pearl! You know I can hear you! I'm sorry I'm not like Pearl with her fancy form and her clean room with no monsters in it. Amethyst? Amethyst's gem! She got poofed again! This is a good opportunity for her. Now she can make a better form. She's coming back! You're right. This is much better! She's doing Pearl! Hey, Garnet. What do you think of my new look, Garnet? I'm more like Pearl now. Isn't it wonderful? Ha! I feel... practically perfect! We need to focus on listening for the creature. Oh, but I can't focus. All these rocks are different sizes. We'll have to organize them by shape and color. Didn't anyone tell nature how I want it to look? - Don't encourage her. - But I need encouragement, Garnet. I need everyone's constant approval. I need to loquaciously converse so I can show off... how smart I am. You can converse with me. Let's finish that quiz. Do you need to plan ahead before you act? - Oh, thoroughly. - Do you obsess over little details? - Completely entirely! - Wow, you're so method. Next time, can you come back as me? This is not a good choice for your form. Lighten up, Garnet. Can't you take a joke? It's not funny. You've made yourself ridiculous. - Ridiculous?! - Keep your voice down! The creature. Grrr! You wanted me to be more like Pearl, and now I am! Pearl would have taken her regeneration seriously! What do you care?! My form is my business! It's my business when it affects the strength of the team! So what?! I'm not strong enough? - Amethyst! - Are you saying I'm weak?! Is it weird I'm getting numb to this? Unh? Mnh! Okay! You know, I wasn't feeling this at first, but I think I might be coming around! Ha! Yo, Ste-Man. My seams straight? Does that new form... hurt you? No. Hey, Garnet. How'd you like to mix it up with this? Just a little somethin' I threw together. You know. This form isn't sustainable, Amethyst. But... you're the one who said I needed to be stronger! Okay, if it's my monster, then I'll deal with it. Raaaahh! Amethyst! Stay behind me! Amethyst! Hah! Amethyst! - Let it go! - No! Ugh. You wanted me to be stronger! I'm doing it! I'm being what you want! I don't want this! Huh? Well, what do you want?! Just tell me, and I'll do that! I can't tell you, Amethyst! You have to figure this out for yourself! She can't. She doesn't want to think about herself! What? Good catch. I knew that thing was real! When Amethyst gets back, we have to go find it. - How long has it been? - Four hours. Four hours?! She's never taken so long. What is she doing in there? I'm not sure. I was too hard on her. Oh, oh! She's coming back! All right. Everyone be supportive. - What? - Aw, you barely changed. Steven! It's perfect. Ehh, whatev. It's just what feels right. - That's why it's perfect. - It is a marked improvement. You finally fixed that shoulder strap that's always bugged me! - Welcome back! - Well done, Amethyst! Knock it off! Hunnhh! - We got to go find the Slinker! - No, it's hug time! Ugh! This is so dumb!
