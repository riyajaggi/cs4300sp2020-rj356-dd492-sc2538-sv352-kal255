 And Steven. Bah! Woof! Oh. Huh? Huh? Aaaaaaah! Aaah! Steven. Didn't you feel that? Feel what? The ground shook! This could be the start of the emergence of the cluster. Stage 1: Slight tremors every quarter hour.

 Stage 2: Full-scale earthquakes. Stage 3: The earth is destroyed! We're running out of time. We need to drill right now! No, it's Malachite! Malachite? What? I was on mask island. I was in a watermelon Steven. They have a lovely community, but Malachite, she was there. Lapis lazuli is losing control. Soon, Jasper will overpower her and Malachite will be loose. Who knows what sort of destruction an unstable fusion like Malachite could cause? All right, gems, Pearl, Amethyst, and I will walk to mask island. Steven, it's too dangerous for you. Stay here and watch after the drill with Peridot. Let's go, gems. To the nearest warp pad. To the nearest warp pad! Whoa. So, lazuli has Jasper trapped in a fusion? You're joking me. It's true! But Lapis must be getting tired from fighting Jasper for so long. Just being on a ship with Jasper made me tired. Whoa. Oh! Aah! I gotta help them! But they told me it was too dangerous. Why don't you just disobey them? Rebel. Isn't that like your guys' thing? Huh, you're right! Ooh, I know! I'll fall asleep and go into a watermelon Steven again. This way, I can help them and be safe, at the same time. Wow. You're a real anarchist. No one can tell me what to do. Wait! What do I do now? Don't just leave me here! All right, let's put an end to this. Give up! I'm impressed. You really held out. Malachi-i-te! They're here. Stop! Pathetic. Don't you see? We've been holding us back for too long. And for what? If we're going to be this thing together, why don't we have some fun? We don't have to fight. You're outnumbered. I may be outnumbered, but you're out of your depth. I can't wait to tear you gems apart. Rawr! Rawr rawr rawr! Rawr rawr rawr! Arr rawr rawr arr rawr rawr rawr. Rawr rawr rawr, rawr. Rawr rawr rawr. Rawr rawr rawr, rawr rawr rawr rawr! Rawr. Rawr. Rawr. Rawr. Rawr. Rawr. Rawr. Rawr. Rawr. Rawr. Rawr. Raw-aw-aw-r! Rawr! You know, you're right. There really is something more to this fusion thing. It's not just a cheap thrill. Aaaah! You've really shown me a whole new world of possibilities. Keep it together. Allow me to thank you. Oh! Sorry, but there's only room for one abomination on this measly planet. Rawwwwr! Huh? Aaaaaaaaah! Oh! Aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa- aa-aa-aa-ah! Huh? Unh! Unh! Argh! What is this?! You think you can hold me down?! Nobody can. Aah! Ah! Not anymore. Hey! Don't forget about me. Agh! Ooh! Arr-arr! You two should spend some time apart. Agh! Urr. I'm alive. Steven? Is that you in there? Thank you. We couldn't have done it without your help. Good job, melonhead. Thank you, all of you. You are truly brave. Awww! Aw. Uh-oh! It must be the cluster. Peridot was right. Steven, it's up to you. The world was destroyed. We don't make it back in time. Wake up. Get Peridot and start drilling. The earth needs you, Steven. We'll be fine. You can do this. We believe in you. You got this, dude! You know the drill. Be careful, Steven. Watch each other's backs. And, Steven, we love you. And, Steven, we love you. If you're done just lying there, maybe it's about time that we stop the world from ending! Where are the others?! They're stuck on mask island! We have to drill without them! Ugh! Am I the only one who understands the meaning of teamwork?! Okay, Steven, are you ready to drill down into the planet, to depths never before reached by your species to stop the cluster before it forms and save your world?! I don't know. Don't say that. Say we'll do it together and it's gonna be great! We're gonna do it together, and it's gonna be great! Liar! Ahh! Wah! Unh! Ready or not, we have a mission. Increasing speed. All right. Bracing for impact. It's actually two more hours to the cluster. Oh. Wish I'd brought some tunes. Uh, thanks. It's kind of freaky down here, huh? Why is that? It's just dark and cramped. I can't even... Stretch out. How did you think you were gonna get everyone in here, anyway? I don't know. They'd shrink or something. We didn't have a lot of time to plan. So, what is the plan? We have a drill. We're going to drill. Get ready. We're about to penetrate the asthenosphere. Whoa! It's all lava. Lava is what comes out of volcanoes. That's superheated Peridotite. Peridot-ite? Yeah. It's made of the same stuff as Peridots. You were made on homeworld, right? Mm-hmm. What was it like? I didn't exist, then I did. I don't have memories of it, just feelings. I know I can never go back to homeworld, but it's hard not to have some feelings for where you came from. But it's fine. I have something different now. W-what's that? You know... You guys. What's that sound? A gem mutant! They must have buried some prototypes with the cluster. They're all over us! They're attacking the drill! What do we do?! Pearl didn't think it was necessary, but I never leave home without a blast cannon. Something doesn't feel right about this. Then use the d-pad. No, it's just... These things, we can't just leave their gems out there. They're going to form again later. If I could just bubble them, then they'd be safe. Come on. We've got to help them. There is no helping them. They're too broken. The beings who used to be in those shards are so shattered they don't know who they are or what's happening around them. They just seek out other gems, looking for the missing pieces of themselves, trying to make themselves whole. These early experiments only combine two or three shards. The cluster will be a billion times bigger... an inseparable fusion capable of destroying worlds, starting with this one. We're hitting some denser rock. This is it! Recovery depth achieved. Target found. Is that... The cluster. What's happening?! It's too late! It's taking form! Steven, I'm sorry I couldn't save you or the billions of other life-forms who matter far, far less to me. Do you have any last words?! I love you, Peridot. Wow. Thanks. It's still struggling to take its form! This means we still might have time! There's still a chance! Just a little repositioning! Peridot, I don't think we should hurt the cluster. I don't think it knows what it's doing. It doesn't matter if it knows what it's doing, it's still going to do it. What?! Is the increased vibration causing damage to your head holes? I don't know! We're not even piercing the crust yet! I need to increase power! Are you going to be okay? Yeah, yeah. I think its just the noise... I think. Keep going. Affirmative. Activating triple-tip penetration mode! Runaway drill! There! Just got to keep balance! Okay. Aah! Aaah! I don't know if it's going to hold! I don't... Understand what's happening! What's wrong?! I don't know! Steven! Steven?! Peridot? Peridot?! Want to. Need to. You... Want to? Want to what? Form! Aaah! Please, stop! It's the cluster. I'm talking to the cluster? But how did I get inside your brain? Brains? Must, have to, want to, need to. Must, have to... Wait! Please, don't take form! Want to, need to... form! Form, form, form! Want form! Want form! Form! Maybe instead of forming, you could do something else? Form! Boy, you've sure got the one-trackiest mind I ever met! Need form! Aah! To be whole. Whole? Oh, you're shards. You just want to find the rest of your gems. But forming won't help you find the rest of yourselves. You'll just destroy the earth. No, no, no, no, no. But if you want to find other gems, there's so many of you right here. Look... shard, meet shard. Have to. Want to. See, you already have so much to talk about. Hello. Hi. This is great! You don't even need to form! You can just stay here! Want to stay. But... Can't stop! Going to form! Can't stop! Going to form! Help! Help! It's okay. If I just bubble you, you won't have to come out. It'll keep you safe. Here, look... like this! I can bubble you! I can bubble you! I can bubble you! Well, that's five out of... Oh, geez. I'm sorry! I can't do it alone! Whoa! Steven, wake up! It doesn't want to form! What?! We got to put it in a bubble! Bubble that?! There's no way! They're bubbling each other! I've got you! You've got this! We've all got each other! Whoa! You did it! We did it together, and it was great! Huh? Guys, you're back! Is Lapis okay? She'll be fine. You look happy! Did you destroy the cluster? - No, I talked to it! - What? It doesn't want to destroy the earth. It just wants company, and it's got it now. It's like a bajillion people! They'll have lots of time to get to know each other... Now that they're in a bubble. How on earth did you bubble that whole thing? We had a little help.
