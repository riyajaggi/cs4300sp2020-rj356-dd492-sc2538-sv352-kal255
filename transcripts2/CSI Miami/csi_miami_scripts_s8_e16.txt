 CSI: Miami (2002â€“2012): Season 8, Episode 16 - L.A. - full transcript 
 During porn king Tony Enright's satanic party, guest Leslie Stoltz is murdered and her friend Anna Kitson, his partner, drugged and raped. Alas Jesse planted a bug because of a feud from his L.A. days, which compromises the investigation, which points to Tony's even more arrogant bodyguard, former Dolphins star Cooper 'Coop' Daly. Horatio realizes it's time to clear Jesse, who apparently disposed of the key evidence in Tony's top-lawyer Darren Vogel's defense for the L.A. murder of Tony's wife. The DA's office insists on a neutral observer, Eric, while LAPD host captain Chris Sutter is suspiciously uncooperative.

It'll be fine, I-I swear to god. I know who you are... And I know what you did in l.A. You are referring to... Baseless allegations. I was acquitted of my wife's murder, And I had nothing to do with this. I noticed the ink on your hand. Very good, sir, very good. And? Clearly, the victim Was killed with a pen. Oh, please, I sign A lot of contracts and checks all day long. I run a major business from my home... You're a pornographer, mr. Enright. It's adult entertainment. It's a multibillion-dollar business. A very legitimate movie business. Well, then, roll credits, mr. Enright. I'm sorry. That's a wrap. Masks, hot air balloons, handcuffs... What kind of party was this? Well, the owner of the house is that guy tony enright. He's the porn king. All right, I'm gonna go back with the body, See if I can get something off the murder weapon. All right. Calleigh, hold up. Check this out. What does that look like to you? Some sort of a listening device. Oh, my god... Somebody was listening in on the murder. That's sick! Leslie starred in tony's films. She was my best friend. I'm really sorry. You know, anna, I, uh, I actually saw you one time before, when you came down To the precinct to give some evidence. You're jesse cardoza's friend, right? Jesse cardoza's no friend of mine. That guy stalked me all the way from l.A. Now why would he do that? 'cause of tony. so ink is ink. I guess you're gonna prove I got a lot of pens in my house. That's good work. Look who it is-- the guy that kills every girl he gets close to. Jesse... Hey, easy, cardoza, or I'll sue your ass for slander. I will take you through the courts Until your hair goes gray. Go ahead, sue me. I will sue you! Mr. Enright! Another word from you, I'll take you into custody myself. You better back it off, t.E. Don't do anything stupid. And you are? I guess you don't recognize me. Coop, please. I used to play for the dolphins. Coop daly's my name. I work for mr. Enright now. Yeah, it's okay, cooper. All right? I'm making conversation, that's all, all right? Now, lieutenant... You ask johnny hollywood here what happened out in los Angeles, okay? Are you talking about when you killed your Jesse? Wife in cold blood and got away with it? Is that what you're saying? Yeah, I'm talking about the time you tried to frame me. Frame you? Excuse me. Excuse me! What are you talking about, you scumbag?! Look, he can't control himself. He's a dirty cop! Mr. Enright! Shut up. Jesse... H... Don't let him get away with this. He's not gonna get away with anything, but this is not the way. Adios! Mr. Enright... Just remember what I said. How could I forget? Boa vista: Anna, is there anything at all That you can remember from last night? No, um, it was just a party. We were all having a great time. Um, tony gave me a glass of wine. And, um, Then it's just a blur. We ran a presumptive on anna's wine glass. It turned up roofies. You were drugged, anna. Get him away from me. Get him away from me! Just trying to help, that's all. Then tell your boss to leave tony alone. Okay, okay, we're good here. I've got it. Anna, I think we should get you to the hospital, okay? For some tests. Why? Because you were drugged, And anything could have happened after that. The strange thing is, Leslie wasn't roofied. Really? I found stomach acid In her mouth and upper esophageal tract. Well, here's my guess... She stumbled onto a sexual assault. Wrong place, wrong time. Cost her her life. What about the murder weapon? Fountain pen. Carbonate tube, sterling silver edge. The killer probably grabbed it right off the desk. Yep. All right, weapon of opportunity. That means he wouldn't have gloved up first. We all know what that means. It means there were prints. Your fingerprints were found On the murder weapon used to kill Leslie stoltz, coop. So, this is all about fingerprints on a pen. Are you serious? Yes, dead serious. You sure know how to be a killjoy, don't ya? Well, you would know. You did it. I didn't kill anybody, little man. Then why are your prints on that pen? Well, I guess you don't recognize me. I used to play for the dolphins When they were the dolphins. I sign a lot of autographs. I probably signed two dozen that night. I bet I must've used every pen in that whole house. That's... Your story? You're gonna stick with that? Not only am I gonna stick with it... But it's the truth, pint-size. I'm five nine. My pants are five nine. I know how these things work, And, uh... We're pretty much done, right? We're done for now. Don't go far, mr. Daly; you'll be back. I guarantee it. You're looking at a soviet-made Laser microwave beam dispersal unit. Great. Now this time in english? It's a transmitter for a wireless microphone. It's a very tricked-out bug. So I was right. Someone had ears on that murder. Is there any way of finding out Where the signal is transmitting? Well, high-tech as it may be, It should be able to be tracked like a normal cell transmission. Triangulating the satellites. Telescoping down. oh. Got a hit right there. Okay, am I Going crazy? The receiver's in our parking garage? No, you're not crazy. I'm gonna go check that out. You want backup? No. I got it. What are you doing, calleigh? Open the trunk, jesse. Back away from the car. Do it. Come on. Is that a recording of the murder? I assume it's on there. I was just about to link in. When did you put the bug at enright's house? Eight days ago. Breaking and entering - I tell you what, man, You are way off the reservation. No, I didn't break in. Enright was hosting a party; I walked in. What are you doing? This guy's a murderer. A murderer! Do you understand that? Well, I think about my wife tracy every day, And then I see his face. I wanted something to put him away. All right. I'll tell you what, if you're right, I'll help you. But you better be right. Woman Oh, my god. What are you doing to her? You shouldn't be here. You're sick! I'm calling the police! Oh, my god. What are you doing to her? You shouldn't be here. You're sick! I'm calling the police! Woman's voice belongs to our murder victim, leslie stoltz, And we think the male voice belongs to coop daly, Enright's security. I'm still working a timbre comparison, But I'm fairly certain it's a lock. Well, it's compelling evidence. Puts daly in the room. Unfortunately, you can't use it in a court of law. Can we float it to potential jurors? The takeaway will be, cardoza's still a dirty cop. Wait a minute, what? Murder case in l.A. , evidence didn't fit his theory, He made it disappear. Rebecca, accusations Were made - nothing was ever proven. Okay, but the cloud around it drove him here to miami, And so here we are again with cardoza's dirty evidence. My advice, horatio: Fire him. Out of the question. Suit yourself. But not only will I reject this evidence, I will reject all evidence That cardoza has anything to do with. He is compromising your lab. Well, then I have no choice but to clear his name. Thank you, walter. Sure thing, h. Horatio. Yes, ms. Nevins? Why go to all this trouble For just one csi? Because he is a member of my team. Oh, cop loyalty. Right. Okay, you get me new information on cardoza, I'll reconsider-- but one of my people goes with you. Based on my approval. Eric. H, hey. Oh, rebecca. So the s.A. Put me on the schedule to work The leslie stoltz murder. Fine. First assignment: Shadow lieutenant caine. Thank you, ms. Nevins. Mm-hmm. What's going on? We're going to l.A. L.A., huh? Lieutenant caine, welcome to l.A. Captain sutter, eric delko. So what brings you gentlemen to my town, Besides the weather, the women and the lakers? Jesse cardoza. How is cardoza? We're here about the enright case, captain. Bel air mansion. Tony enright sliced up his wife. Cardoza was the primary. And he had him nailed, till trial. How do you go from top cop to zero? That's all on the record. I need to see that file, captain. Gentlemen, that ship sailed. Double jeopardy's a bitch. Not for cardoza. Well, that doesn't sound like my business. It is now. All right, gentlemen, follow me. All this evidence says one thing: Enright murdered his wife brutally. The guy's a known wife abuser. Jesse found blood from the dead wife On enright's clothes and in his car. And then he walks. Yeah. Right in front of all the cameras. Real black mark for the department. Ah. You know what? Here. Here's the thing that brought jesse down. Homicide found a key piece of evidence At the murder scene. A cuff link was thought to belong to another suspect, Not enright. Cardoza photographed it... But it never showed up in the evidence locker. Why not? Paper says it went missing. Initials "a.T." Jury tv had gavel-to-gavel coverage of the whole trial. Uh... Yeah. This is from the day enright's lawyer grilled jesse. Attorney Ah, detective cardoza... Now, you took the photograph Of this bloody cuff link at the murder scene, correct? Yes, I did. Ah. And would you please read out for the court, Uh, the initials that are engraved on that cuff link? "a.T." Well, those don't appear to be The initials of my client, tony enright, now, do they? Was that a yes or a no? No. No. Thank you. Um, there-there appears to be Blood on this cuff link. Now, will you tell us, please, is that the victim's blood Or the perpetrator? I don't know. I'm so sorry, I'm... Going a little deaf in this ear. Could you, uh, repeat that a bit louder? I don't know. You don't know? He doesn't know. Well! But surely, This is very important evidence. I mean, mrs. Enright could have ripped it from the sleeve Of her perpetrator, right? All right, tell me, where is it? Where is this bloody cuff link that you photographed so ably At the crime scene? We've been unable to locate it. It disappeared... Just poof, hmm? I mean, evidence that could prove That someone other than my client Murdered victoria enright. Yes. So you wouldn't mind if they searched your house For that cuff link, would you? You're not gonna find it there. Why? Did you hide it somewhere else? That's not what I meant. No. What you meant... Was to be judge and jury, Hiding evidence that would vindicate my client. And you know what? You very nearly succeeded. Thank you. So... Who owns the cuff link... And where did it go, eric? We figure that out, we clear jesse, right? Or we sink him. Okay. Our forensic nurse found evidence Of forcible sexual intercourse. But there was no evidence of male contribution. What does that mean? It means that your attacker wore a condom. None of this makes sense. I know. This may be a little strange question to ask, But, um... Do you think that tony could've had anything to do with it? How can you even ask me that? Look, tony gets accused of things, But... People don't know him like I do. I'm just asking because I was married to someone like him once. And, um, I know what that can do to your self-image. It's not like that with tony and me. And I used to defend him, as well. And I paid a pretty heavy price. If, um... I mean, if you ever feel like you want to talk to someone, Here's my card. Okay, guys. We're now in a cisco webex meeting. Are we ready? Dave, is this line secure? Absolutely secure, h. The system guarantees it. Horatio, I'm sure I don't have to tell you, But I never touched that cuff link. I saw it and I popped off two-by-fives. Okay, I understand that, jesse. Now, can we run the cuff link through the database, gentlemen? Our cuff link has a unique appearance, So we should be able to run it Through image recognition software. I did a similar search Two and a half years ago, nothing came up. No, no, no. This is different, this is new. It's like facial recognition software. Compares shapes and features, then searches for Any comparable image anywhere on the web. Okay, did we get a match? We have a match. Westside platinum jewelers. I heard of that place. They must have taken their store online. Okay, eric and I are gonna check into that. Thank you, gentlemen. What can I do? Jesse, just lay low. H. Westside platinum. I got a batch of orders for the cuff links. All right, I'm gonna print out the company list, We'll go name by name. Wait a second. Right there. Darren vogel. That's enright's attorney. Yeah, vogel bought a pair of the cuff links A week before the murder. Think that's a coincidence? Not a chance, eric. Oh... Looks like we've got some babysitters. Have a nice day, gentlemen. well, what are you doing? What... What are you wearing? Get off the phone, please. bunny? Yeah. No, I'll buy it for you, I'll buy it. Excuse me. Uh, I think we've got a prospective client here. Yes, I-I've got to go. All right. Yeah, all right. I'll see you at 7:00. Yeah, love you. Now, you boys know that my billing rate is $2,000 an hour. But here's the good news: I take euros. We are not soliciting counsel. We're here about the tony enright case. Enright? Come on. That's old history, isn't it? He was acquitted. Until now. I'm in the acquittal business. Look, it's my life's mission to keep the wrongly accused From being incarcerated. Yeah, like, uh, like that little girl last year, right? Was accused of killing her brother. Yes! Thank you for bringing that up. One of my great trials. Hannah miller. Evidence against hannah was, uh, was overwhelming. Yes. Until they found a pair Of girl's glasses at the crime scene that didn't match. Now, obviously, that was left by the real killer. And the jury agreed with me. Yes. How convenient. Ah, well, you know, I'm good at finding holes in the prosecution's case. I mean, that is my gift. Your gift is planting evidence. Oh, wh-wh-wh-whoo. Careful. That's libelous. About the enright case. Fact remains that Those cuff links left a reasonable doubt, And you were the one that purchased 'em. We have proof right there. Oh, I see. This is proof. Is it? Well, this is fake. Huh. Oh. Oh, yeah, that's my credit card number there. Oh! Vexing, isn't it? Eh? The cuff link that I bought - very similar In design and style - winds up at a crime scene. Let's cut the bs. You planted it there to help your client beat a murder rap. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Is that your theory? That's not fact. There's no foundation there. Plant anything else, and I will personally drive you to chino. Yes, I believe you would. As a matter of fact, I've been contemplating retiring, anyway. That's your problem. You know, you can buy a sense of humor. We got to catch this guy, calleigh. We got to catch him. I just-- I know he did it. I think I may have found a way. Really? Well, I started thinking about it, And the print alone is not gonna sink coop daly. No, he's got, uh, that other explanation-- The, um, autograph defense. Exactly. So if the print won't do it, maybe what's inside The print will. Now you lost me. I'm gonna break down The chemical compound in coop's fingerprint. Within that, I think there may be something he can't refute. Dimethicone silicone - based lubricant, And cells consistent with lambskin. Lambskin? That's a condom. Exactly. Coop was wearing a condom. So was anna's rapist. This spectra has a unique chemical signature. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna run it against the spectra from anna's sex kit. So, um, what kind of condom do I use? What's my favorite? My brand of choice? I rarely use them. So it's kind of a, um, Personal question. Actually, it's evidence. Really? There were specific traces In anna kitson that we also found In the oil of your fingerprint. That print is the same as the one on the murder weapon. So, just to get this straight, you raped anna, You killed leslie stoltz, And we can tie you to both. You guys are pretty funny. I mean, you just crack me up. You really think you're gonna pin a murder rap on me... Based on a lambskin condom? I don't think anybody here Mentioned a lambskin condom, genius. That's knowledge only the killer would have. Ah. You know, mr. Enright told me That she'd be a willing participant. He told me that he was sick of the bitch. He gave her to me, as a bonus, Because we had a good year. You know, if she would've just relaxed and just... Stayed with the program, Everything would've been just fine. So that's when leslie tried to stop you. She came barging in. And everything kind of went, uh... Everything kind of went haywire. Oh, my god. What are you doing to her? You shouldn't be here. So you roofied anna Because she wouldn't cooperate. I didn't roofie anybody, pint-size. That was tony. Do you want her? You can have her. Ah, you're kidding, right? No, I'm not kidding, coop. It's been a really, really good year, okay? Now you, my friend, deserve a little bonus. Ladies, refreshers. You're under arrest, Mr. Daly. Get this animal out of here. See you later, baby. Well, it's about time. Do you mind telling me Why I have been here for over an hour, drinking this swill... With no access to a telephone? Well, I'll tell you what. You can borrow mine, mr. Enright. Use it to call your lawyer. Let him know we're booking you for pandering And possession of a controlled substance. And we've got a good shot at tying you in to leslie stoltz's murder. Oh, please. You people just don't get it, do you? You know, your good friend coop daly-- He sold you out. The actions you took led to leslie stoltz's death. That's felony murder. Well, I could just say one little magic word. What's that? Car... Do... Za. The judge is going to toss this case out right away, And you know it. You see, that's where you're wrong, mr. Enright. So, what are you saying? You going to do a better job than the world-famous lapd? If any of these crime scene photos would have shown Who took that cuff link, I think someone would have noticed by now. Somebody did notice. Eric, take a look at this. It's the same lady in every one of these photos. Yes. Watch this. Bang, bang, bang. That's her again. She's got... She's got a camera. Eric, she can help us. h, in a city as big as l.A., How are we going to find one girl? This is how. She's got a press pass. Olivia burch. Excuse me. Captain sutter. Enjoying your lunch, lieutenant? Yes, as a matter of fact we are. We're doing what we came to los angeles to do, captain. Then you know you're wasting your time. That's called clean police work. Are you suggesting I'm not clean? I guess we're about to find out, captain. Ooh, you getting what you need? Everything, uh, everything groovy? Got the grippers in place and all that? Yeah. So how...? I think it's that way. Okay, let me take... You don't know. Okay, I'll take it of you. Do the move. Great. Nice, billy, really nice. Ms. Burch. Ms. Burch. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is a closed set. I'm eric delko from miami state attorney's office. And this is lieutenant caine From miami-dade pd. Could we have a word, please? Take a break, billy. What can I do for you? The tony enright case. We have a photograph Of you at the crime scene from a few years ago. Oh, yeah. I was freelancing then. Thought I could sell a few shots to a news wire, maybe a tabloid. Did you? Two hours in the sun, three rolls of film-- Didn't sell a thing. Do you still have the photographs? Yeah, I have everything inside. Stuart, can you go grab my negatives for me? Copy that. Be right back, billy. What are you hoping to find? We're trying to clear a good man's name. These are, uh, these are all from the enright crime scene. Okay, let's scan those. All right. Let me invert the images. All right, there's jesse, there's the house, The front gate, more house. What else we got, eric? wait a minute. Eric, go back. Go back. What is he doing? Evidence marker number four, eric. Number four, that's the cuff link. That's the missing evidence. Right. Who is this? I don't know. It isn't cardoza. It's not jesse. Who is that? Let me clean up the flare on his face. Hitting the highlights. Clean up some of this mess. Captain sutter. Lieutenant caine. The beatles played on this stage. I know that. I was here. You come alone? Just like I said I would. Why here? I like my privacy. What's this all about, caine? Where'd you get this photo? You let jesse cardoza take the fall for something you did. What exactly do you want, caine? I want you to come clean. All right. We knew enright had murdered his wife. And we had him, too. Dead to rights. When I saw that cuff link, I knew that his slick lawyers would get him off, So I pocketed it. No harm, no foul. The right guy goes down. And that's the way it should be. But I had no idea Cardoza had already taken a photograph of it. So you allowed it to look like he tampered with evidence. I figured he was young. Get a couple weeks Desk duty, slap on the wrist. Yes, but it didn't turn out that way, did it? No. His wife was murdered - probably by enright. That's something I got to live with every day. Where's the cuff link? I keep it right here. Always. So I'll never forget. Slowly. Take it. What now? What now? I think you know what to do. In light of the new evidence that's been presented to us, I would like to extend A long overdue apology to jesse cardoza, On behalf of the city, this department And the district attorney's office. Mr. Cardoza, who is no longer a member of the lapd, Is a shining example of what this department And all its officers should strive for every day. Hey, sweetheart, sweetheart, hey, don't worry. I'm gonna be out of here by dinner. It's all gonna be fine. We can go to our special little place that we love To go to together. You remember that place? Remember that place? Do you remember that place, huh?! Just go to hell! Huh?! You little bitch! you're making a really bad mistake, sweetheart. Really, really bad mistake! My lawyer just flew in. Vogel will get me off. Oh, and there's super cop. God, you're so good, huh? You're really good. Come around and watch a movie sometime. Where was the missing cuff link found, That it couldn't be recovered two years ago? I'm unable to comment on that at this time. Suffice it to say that mr. Cardoza's name And reputation has been cleared. Well, that door's not going to open itself. Thank you. Lieutenant. You know, uh, Tony enright is never going to see The inside of a prison cell. Don't be too sure, mr. Vogel. Actually, I'm dead sure. I want you out of miami. Have you come to wish me bon voyage? By the way, if you're ever in the emirates, Don't bother to call. Don't worry, I'll get the door. Thank you. You would have done the same for me, jesse. http://www.simail.si - small open source e-mail client, with some unique features not found in any other commercial or oss client http://xcollect.sf.net - organize your movies, tv seris & games collections
