 [siren wailing] [car horns blaring] - Hello. - Hi. How are you today? You know how we do. - Mm. - Take some socks. - Thank you. - Take a condom. - Thank you. - Okay. Goodbye, sweetie. See you at the shelter tonight, lovebirds. [chuckling]

 Hey, you. You're gonna step over them and not gonna say nothing? Oh, sorry. Ugh. Okay. Mama, it happened again. - Aww. - I don't know what to do. Who was bothering you? - The fat one with the mustache? - [man whooping] I know him. I'll talk to him. You go to the shelter tonight, okay? Go, go. [man yelling] Excuse me. Pardon me. I'm looking for a woman named Ysela. Never heard of her.

 Er... I was told I might find her in these parts. Which part you from, dandy? Are you sure you have no idea who she is? Who want to know? I have a message for her from a woman named Anna Madrigal. Anna Madrigal? That bitch is still alive? Anybody want a drink? I could light a joint. [sighs] How about some food? Why don't we just feel our feelings? I'm not sure what to feel. Uh... I still can't believe any of this. Anna's always been a mystery, but I never believed she actually had anything to hide. No, the real mystery is why Anna would be willing to give up Barbary Lane just to hide something from 50 years ago. Keep your voice down. She's resting. Well, why wouldn't she just tell us the truth? Because she was ashamed. After all these years? - What has she got to be ashamed of? - Are you serious? So she took some shady money. That was stolen from her community. Anna was in an impossible situation that none of us can possibly understand. She did what she felt that she had to do in order to survive. That is exactly what I was trying to say. Guys, she had an affair with a cop. A trans woman in the '60s. - So, she deserves to be blackmailed? - Of course not, but I get why she wanted to keep it a secret. Okay, fine. But here's the thing. There would be no Barbary Lane, okay? We wouldn't know each other if Anna hadn't done what she did. - Have you heard from Shawna? - She sent a text. Said she was safe. That's all. I'm sure she's okay. We're all going to be okay. Anna's going to be okay. The truth is painful, yes, but at least now the FBI can catch whoever did this, no one'll have to leave Barbary Lane and everything can go back to normal. - Ugh! Maybe we should have that drink. - Yeah. - Thank God. - Can we talk about how somebody just blackmailed Anna Madrigal? - I mean, what the fuck? - I know she swears it's not, - but don't... - It's not that Ysela woman. - How can you be so sure? - Well... - Because she's 70 years old. - So? Well, why'd she wait so long? Maybe she was waiting for the market to peak. Okay, well, maybe it's not her, but when the FBI gets here... Oh, yeah. On that, they, uh... they said it would be... Thursday before they come around to take statements. Thursday? Well, 24 hours... ish. See? Being blackmailed's just like getting your cable hooked up. Did you explain that there is a crime in progress? - Um... - [door opens] [all] Hi! I always know when you're talking about me. We're just... We're concerned. How are you feeling? I want you all to know how much your... kindness in this time has... has meant. We love you, Anna. Always. [knocking at door] Ah. Your chariot awaits, madam. Are you sure this is a good idea? I have no idea, darling. But it's what I have to do. [sighs] [sighs] Shit, fuck! Sweet Jesus, Mary Ann. I mean, yeah, what Anna did, it's fucked up. ♪ She was down to fuck No fret, no fight ♪ ♪ She had good luck, I stayed the night ♪ ♪ Saw her every night that week Dinner dates, had lots to eat... ♪ But, like, it's super hard for trans people now. How do you know what you would have done back then? You don't. I don't. This is exactly why she couldn't tell us, right? Because she knew we'd all just be sitting around, judging her. ♪ You like us ♪ ♪ And we can be three ♪ ♪ We can be three... ♪ It makes me sad. Hm. I don't like being sad. [clicking sound] - Do you hear that noise, too? - [clicking continues] Or am I just really stoned? [clicking] What's going on? [woman] Get on with it. Let's go! Put the flyers... Come on, guys... What is it? It says Barbary Lane's being torn down. Tomorrow! Excuse me. Answer my question. - Lady, all I know is what's on the flyer. - But that's unacceptable! The deed to this property was signed over to a mystery owner under false and illegal pretenses. And therefore, whoever you work for has no authority whatsoever to tear this place down. I look like a lawyer to you? You see, I don't appreciate that. I demand to know who hired you. I do what the foreman tells me. You got a problem? Take it up with the boss. [Mary Ann] There. That must be her. - [Michael] Who? - The foreman... Forewoman. Oh, my God, I... I've seen her before. Where have I... [Debra yelling] I don't know... It was at Harrison's. She works for him, or he hires her, or something. Michael. Oh, don't even. - No, but what if it's Harrison? - No. - Just think about it. - It's impossible. Who knew about Barbary Lane this whole time? Mary Ann, wash your mouth out with soap right now. Who just came back into town recently to flip properties? Stop talking. I called the police. They said this is actually an FBI matter, so I'm back on hold. Brian, we have a theory. [Michael] No, you have a theory. I want no part in this. Do I even wanna know? [door opens] - [door closes] - [man 1] Flight to Florence, the whole time she reads a book. I said, "You can do that in Connecticut." [man 2] I always wanted to get to Italy, but we just never made it. [man 1] It's not too late. Now is the moment, and then you think, "What?" [Robert] Aah! There we go. The stone is made out of imported burgundy clay. It makes the crust... perfetto. [chuckling] Hey there, Rip Van Winkle. I see you found the Bloodies. I feel like I just slept for, like, six years. No, I'm glad you got some rest. Let me introduce you. - These are guys from the club. - Oh! - The club, yeah. - [all] Hi. This is Shawna. She's Mary Ann's, um... Casualty? [all laughing] Well, it's really nice to meet you fellas, but... ah, I forgot my boat shoes. - [laughter] - Long as you drink bourbon. Okay. - Maybe I'm into this club. [sighs] - [laughter] [men chuckle] So, which one is the foreman woman? - The scary lesbian. - [Debra] Steve. Yo! We got a problem. How do you know she's gay? Because... look at her. - Then you should talk to her. - Why, because I know the secret handshake? No. What if she recognizes me? Someone has to. The person who hired this crew is the person who's blackmailing Anna. We can't wait for the FBI. We have to find out who's responsible before it's too late. - [gasps] - What? That was so Jessica Fletcher, like, to the T. All right, I'll talk to her. Relax. Lesbians like me. Hi there. My name's Brian. We have to find a way to stall this crew. [Brian] Can you give us any information... I have an idea. Yeah, let's see them bulldoze us now. Wait, that's too tight. [grunts] Are you sure you wanna do this? Uh, hell, yes. This is for Anna. And our 300,000 followers. I guess the revolution will be livestreamed. Mm. Here we go. You're, like, really skilled with tying people up. I went through a phase, in the '90s. [chuckling] Yeah! [crashing] Okay, I got the info. It was easier than I thought. Turns out she's not a lesbian. Oh, well... Good for you, Brian. I'm kidding. Of course she's a lesbian. What did she say? Were you a little jealous just now? Brian, please. - Just, let's hear it. - Okay. Here's where it gets weird. [laughs] It was weird long before now. Fair enough, but here's where it gets weirder. She was hired by a company called Four Meditations on Darkness LLC. - Four... What? - I know. She said she never talked to an actual human. They did everything through email. Michael. - I need your computer. - Okay. - See? - [man] Oh, boy. Look, look. - What's the tattoo? - Exactly. Yeah, apparently it's a beetle, and it's her entire arm. Well, what'd you say back? What am I supposed to say? It's terrible. - [chuckling] - Look... if your 25-year-old daughter is sending you a picture of her first tattoo, she wants your approval. Nuh-uh. She wants me to be horrified. - [man] Mm. Yeah. - Mission accomplished. Okay, here's what you say. I'm dictating, Doug. - Ohh! - [chuckling] Okay, okay. "Very cool, exclamation. I love it, exclamation." That's it. Hit send. [all laughing] Would you come translate for all of our kids? Seriously, your dad must be lucky if he can just talk to you and not feel like he's stumbling around in the dark. - Yeah. - Like us. - Mm-hmm. - It's always different with your own family, you know. You know, most of us who are parents, no idea what the hell we're doin', just doin' the best we can. - Mm-hmm. - Sometimes the absolute best is... total shit, but... most of us are trying. - [all] Mm-hmm. - Mm. You want another? Uh... No, you know what? I think I'm good, but... thanks for letting me crash the party, really. - [phone alert] - Oh! Oh, hey, hey. Here we go, here we go. She wrote back. She says, "Who stole my dad's phone?" [raucous laughter] The first thing we have to do is we have to figure out what this Four Meditations thing - really means. - [phone alert] Oh, my God. What? It's a text from Harrison. - Here. Uh, you read it. - Mm-mm. What's wrong with you? It's a text. Uh, "Hey, bud, all set for you to move in here. - You deserve to be out of that drama." - Yeah. Then one of those emojis, like... - [in unison] Oh, God. - [scoffs] What if it is him? Hey, here's something. Uh... Four Meditations LLC... - It's a shell company. - Damn it. What if... Okay, what if... What if I just went to Harrison? What if I was like, "Harrison, I know it's you!" - [chuckles] - What? Too butch? [Brian] We can't just accuse him. We don't have any actual evidence Harrison's involved. [phone rings] - Oh, shit. - What, is it Harrison? No. It's Ben. Oh! He's reaching out. That's good. Don't talk to him. Unless you're ready. [exhales heavily] Hello? No, no, I'm not busy. Sorry to bug you out of the blue, but I got a box of your stuff here. I can just drop it off if you want. Oh. Yeah. Okay. [Ben] I'm outside. I dunno if you wanna come out and get it or... [Michael] Wait. Outside where? Hey. Thank you. I thought you were still angry with me. Hm. I thought I'd be angry with myself for a while, you know, try somethin' new. Are you sleeping? Not much. Not since she left. Okay. You know, I think I... I might have an Ambien in here. [chuckles] I got a new prescription before I left, so I think... You don't have to try and fix everything, you know? Guys, he's at Harrison's. Ben's at Harrison's right now. Hello? - I... I'm here. I'm here. - You... You cut out. I... I... I could leave the stuff here if you wanted. No, no. I... I mean, I... I'm not there. I never actually moved in, but that's not what I... Okay, this is, uh... This is really hard to explain, but, like... Remember that part in Murder, She Wrote when the python is in the closet? I'm in that part, in real life, right now. What? This is gonna sound bonkers. "How to practice darkness meditation." - [scoffs] - No. How about this? Four Meditations on Darkness. What is it? Well, it looks like an art piece, was part of a show of young artists. Well, does it list the name of the artist? Not that I could see. It says the show was funded by the San Francisco Arts Foundation. I'm gonna call DeDe. Mm-hmm. So you're saying that Harrison could be a psycho criminal mastermind? I know. So, I was right. It's just a theory. I mean, just like evolution is a theory, but... [door closes] Shit. - Ben? - Shit, shit, shit... Ben! Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm here. I'm here. Harrison just came outside. [car alarm chirps] Uh-huh. - He's going somewhere. - [engine starts] I'm gonna follow this bastard. No, babe... I mean, Ben. Just... uh... Please be careful. I will. - You've reached DeDe Halcyon. - Oh, she's not answering. - Please leave a message. - Shit. Shit, shit, shit. [horn blares] [Debra on loudspeaker] This is your official warning. Vacate the premises with your property, or you will be removed. - Oh. - Motherfucker. - [Debra] Whether you like it or not... - Ugh. If there's one thing I hate, it's an evil lesbian. It's such a trope. - We have to go. - What? Where are we going? [moaning] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [tapping at door] Oh, my God! [banging at door] - Oh, my God. - [sighs] Hello. Mary Ann, what do you want? I tried to stop her. I'm so... sorry. I'm sorry to bother. If... If I remember correctly, you sit on the board of the San Francisco Arts Foundation? There's a time and a place for philanthropy. I need a list of all the art the foundation's funded. I promise I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't urgent. Hi, Mary Ann. Margot. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh! I am so sorry. Too late, Mary Ann. Let's find what you need and get you on your way. [phone alert] Ben says Harrison just stopped to get coffee. Yeah. We're gonna blow this case wide open. [both chuckle] [groans] I accidentally called him "babe" on the phone. Well, at least you're talking. Do I tell him I fucked somebody after we broke up? God, no. It wasn't cheating. Ah, you know what? I don't know. So don't... So don't listen to me, man. I have no more advice to give. - I have fucked enough up already. - No, don't say that. You gotta give yourself a break. I know. She'll be okay. It's just that I can't stop thinking it's never going to be the same with us. - That's what I can't let go of. - [sighs] Okay. Here we go. This is... It's every art show, project, and artist that the... that the foundation funded last year, so something in here must lead us to the artist. - [phone alert] - What's the latest on Harrison? He got a cranberry scone with his coffee. Mm! [DeDe moaning] We should go. [moaning continues] I can't believe this is actually working. People are showing up. Is it bad that I sort of loathe these people? Hey! Hate them all you want, right now they're the only thing keeping the demo crew from cutting us loose. - Hashtag #savebarbarylane. - [Jonathan] Save Barbary Lane. - Save Barbary Lane. - ...Lane. [chanting] Save Barbary Lane! - [crowd chant] Save Barbary Lane! - Come on! Where's the second light kit? Hm... You... You wanted two? Yeah, remember when I asked you for two? No. Yeah. Copy that. Yeah. [phone rings] - Hey. - [Shawna] Hey. - Didn't expect to hear from you. - Yeah. I... I mean, I didn't, uh... expect you to pick up. I was gonna leave a voicemail. - Want me to hang up? - No. Heard you left town. Yeah, things kind of, uh... fell apart. [chuckles] Sorry to hear that. Look... I owe you an apology. I sh... I shouldn't have said what I said. It was cruel. I was hurt. I... I mean, I don't... I don't believe what I said. I mean, I guess we're all broken, but... I mean, I don't think we're unfixable. Well, an... anyway, I just wanted to call and say that. Okay. How's the documentary going? Uh, it's... it's coming together. Listen, I gotta go, but, um... Yeah, okay. Take care. Yeah, you, too. - [clattering] - [Lucas] Oh, shit. Uh... [laughs] Two light kits. Let's fucking go. Can I just tell you? This is the best day I've had... in a while. Same. [laughs] Oh, sorry, I'm not supposed to move. It's fine, it's just a sketch. Not yet. [phone buzzes] It's the third time he's called. Maybe you should take it? [sighs] What is it, Jake? [Debra] Get! Go! Let's go, out. Out! I know you don't really wanna hear from me right now, but I kind of need a favor. You need a favor? Not for me, for Anna. [Debra] Take your selfies and get out! [Margot] Where are you? At Barbary Lane. Shit's going down, Margot. It's fucking crazy here. What's going on? I'll explain everything. I just need you to call Body Politic. I don't get it. This is the gallery where they showed Four Meditations? According to the foundation's research. Maybe it's avant-garde? That's, uh, French for "bullshit." This cube of trash costs $12,000. Ahem! The artist of Four Meditations on Darkness is called Von Trapp. Von Trapp? Like The Sound of Music? I don't know what that is. Just to be clear, "Von Trapp" is a... is a fake name. Like Banksy. Yeah, like Banksy. Do you have any information about the artist's real identity? Identity? Isn't that what art's supposed to grapple with? [whispers] Okay. Just one sec. I'm about to grapple her. Guys, I just remembered, Harrison loves Sound of Music. Oh, yeah? Does he also love puppies and frozen yogurt? - I'm just saying... - Doesn't mean anything. Well, we have very little to go on. Hi. Hello. [chuckles] Can you tell us anything at all? About the artist, about the artwork? Anything at all? [scoffs] Uh... Von Trapp's pieces sold to one buyer before the show even opened. So, guess they have a fan. Maybe the buyer knows something. Wo... Wonderful. Can you tell us who the buyer is? Depends. Would you like to purchase something? [clicks tongue] Do you take American Express? You sure you're okay? Thank you, Sam. For everything. You just call me when you're ready to come home. I will. Anna Madrigal. The great lady of Barbary Lane. [sighs] Blackmailed at 90 years old. I suppose you only blackmail someone who's afraid to lose her dignity. That's always what you craved. Isn't it, Anna? Dignity? What a price you were willing to pay. Our dignity for yours. That's why I'm here. I waited... too long. Much too long. But here I am... to ask your forgiveness. Can you forgive me? I carried bitterness in my heart for you, Anna. I did. For a time. But my life went on. And I had love, too. And pain, and sorrow, and heartbreak. And none of it had to do with you. But sometimes, yes, I would think of you. Up there, in that house on the hill. But you made your choices. And I made mine. You want forgiveness? Not mine to give. Not anymore. Whatever you carry, this shame, this... pain... is yours alone. What should I do, Ysela? I've made a mess... of everything. Everything I've tried to do to make up for what I've done... Everything... seems to be coming undone. You haven't changed, Anna. Still willing to run from the fight. If you believe in the life you've lived... then don't let someone else... take it away. Take back your story... before it's too late. Hm. [Ida] Uh-huh. Look, all I can promise is that I'll ask the children. Okay. All right, listen up, queers. Just got off the phone with Margot. Apparently there's some shady shit goin' on up at Barbary Lane. People threatenin' to tear the whole place down. Margot wants us to come up there and raise our voices, but if we go... we all go together. Well, fuck, yeah, we're goin'! [all] Yeah! [Ida] All right, then. Put on your marchin' boots, bitches. We got some walkin' to do.

I hope that wasn't too weird. [both chuckle] No, I'm glad you came. I guess I just wanted to see where Mary Ann ended up. What she left me for. Where are you gonna go now? Uh, honestly, I don't know. I'm, uh... Maybe I'll stay in the city for a bit, but... I'm not even sure I like New York yet, so... You and Mary Ann never... had kids. Mm. - How come? - Ah, well... I don't know. I guess... Well, it was Mary Ann's decision. Most things ended up being Mary Ann's decision. I don't know if this is right, but... I think, deep down, she felt she failed the first time around. With you. I mean, that she failed you. I think... some part of her resolved that she didn't have it in her. That's probably true. No, it's not. [wavering] Mary Ann could have been a good mother, you know. If she'd given it a chance. [man on PA] Train approaching track one. Boarding train to Grand Central. Please have your tickets ready to show at the ticket desk. Can I have a hug? Holy shit, you guys. Ben just followed Harrison to Barbary Lane. - See? - Well, should we go there? Well, we just got here. [Michael] Whoa. The people who bought Four Meditations - live here? - [Brian] Mm-hm. All right, how should we do this? Well, how about we knock on the door and we ask them what they can tell us about the art? Yeah, see if they wanna trade. We can't just roll up in a pickup truck and explain everything. Why not? Because it's insane. - Oh. - We... We need a credible cover story. Oh! I see, this is how you and Shawna - ended up in bad drag that day. - [chuckles] Uh, well, I... I don't mean disguises. I mean, who are we? Why are we here? I agree with Brian. - But I also like role play, so I'm torn. - How about... How about this? Brian and I are a wealthy, art-collecting couple. - Yes, from Utah. - Yeah. - No. - You're supposed to "Yes, and." All right, look. We can be a couple, but who's Michael gonna be? I'll be your art consultant! There's gotta be something in here I can repurpose. Yeah, I was gonna say, you can just stay in the truck. Excuse me? Nobody puts Baby in the corner. Honey...

Thank you so much for taking the time. Oh, not at all. - Happy to meet with fellow art lovers. - [Michael] Sì, sì. - Our art consultant. - Stefano. Stefano is the one who spoke so highly of Four Meditations. Indeed? [in Italian] Can I lick your asshole? Hm? - Aah! - [both laughing] Right. Well, if you'll just follow me, I'll show you the piece. Easy does it, principessa. This is Four Meditations on Darkness. You know, I gotta say, I'm kind of shocked that you've even heard of it. Personally, I think it's abysmal. - You do? - Yeah. That's why I keep the rest of it in the closet. You wanna see that, too? Have them bring up the rest of it. This shit's ridiculous. You're gonna let us in. You ain't gonna stop us from getting into this courtyard. - Back it up. Back it up right now! - Watch it! You wanna watch something, bitch? Watch this. Hey, hey, hey! - Hey! - [crowd] Hey, hey!

Yes! ♪ Tell me how you want me ♪ [Mary Ann] Could you tell us more about the artist? Well, I certainly could. - Not sure what you want to know. - [phone buzzes] Scusi. Ben? What's happening? It... It's not Harrison. What do you mean? How do you know? 'Cause he told me and I believe him. You asked him? - Yeah, like a fucking idiot. - Are you sure? I'm sure. I'm sure, Michael.
