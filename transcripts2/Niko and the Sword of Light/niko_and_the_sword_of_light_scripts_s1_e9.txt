 Previously on "Niko  and the Sword of Light"... This is probably worth something. [screaming] Greetings, small creature. Mandok: I owe you. Here. This also covers any breakage back there in your boudoir. - What are you doing? - Demonstrating my loyalty. No one betrays Nar Est. He's still useful to me. Rasper: I planted a ping beetle on him. I believe these pools are broken.

 - Give it back! - No. - Give it back! - No! Do you have any idea how much a grackleflint egg goes for on the open market? I do not! [roaring] [screaming] [screeching] Woohoo! Whoa! [screeching] [screeching] [whimpering] Fine. Here you go, nice giant bird monster. Here's your egg back. - [screeching] - [screaming] [loud thuds] Niko: We are trapped! Whoa-whoa-ho! [creaking] We are not trapped. In what way are we not trapped? - Wait for it. - This does feel like  we are trapped! Wait for it. Lyra: You keep saying that. Wait for what? [screaming] I compliment you on this escape. Mandok the resourceful, that's me. And Mandok the penniless. That grackleflint egg was worth thousands. I bet it's worth more to its mother. I am wondering about something. Yeah? What's that? What happens when the water stops? [screaming] ♪♪ A ship. In the sky. When the water stops is when I save our lives. Welcome to the Cloudscape, kiddies. Lyra: This ship runs on clouds. This is the world above the world. Most people don't even know it's here, but Mandok gets around. Amazing. Has this always been here? Well, as far as I know. The Skyfolk dock their cloud clippers above geysers pretty often. It's a good spot to refuel and re-supply. And I can see by the colors this ship is flying... that we may not be strictly welcome. Why? These particular Skyfolk are touchy about visitors. They're kind of... piratical. Pirates? We're among pirates? [grunting] [screaming] [grunting] We prefer gentlemen of opportunity. And ladies. Right you are, Poofhilda. Gentlemen and ladies of opportunity, that's us indeed. Now, who's got the treasure? We don't have any treasure. Uh-- Bosun Billows of the great ship Thunderhead. No treasure, eh? Well, if you could pay, you'd be passengers, but if you've got no treasure-- They're stowaways. - Ahh, stowaways! - Stowaways, mate! Not stowaways. Visitors. That's us. We are on an urgent mission to defeat the darkness. [grunting] Poofhilda, what's the line on stowaways? Stowaways get a hop on the drop board. Drop board? You mean to drop us? Ah, no. We just watch you hop on the board for a bit, and see what happens. [laughing] Hop on the board. Yeah, the hop on the board. Hold it! I do, in fact, have treasure. How about marzipan cabbage seeds? Uh, pre-assorted fish pebbles? Ooh, I know, beast grease? Nobody likes a squeaky beast. No, I mean treasure, friend. Coins, jewelry, grackleflint eggs. [groans] Wait a jiff. Do I know you? Uh-- uh-- [Italian accent] maybe I've just got one of those faces. Love the accent. Did you have that a moment ago? Let's say I did. [clears throat] If we surrender our weapons, will you trust us to, um, parlay with your captain? [Italian accent] The captain? Is that absolutely necessary? Hmm... Lyra, I must not give up my sword. I suppose that's reasonable. None of you could be very dangerous unarmed. Except possibly that mysterious mustachioed  fellow. [grunting] Niko. [grunting] Hang on there. Where did you get that necklace from? All: Ooh. - My friend Man-- - Man, oh, man. "Hoomans" these days. Always picking things up here and there. Well, now you're definitely seeing the captain. Anyone who wears a sacred skywhale tooth is welcome aboard this ship. Great. [whimpers] Now they're in the sky? What happened at the pools? Peck 'em to pieces. [heavy sigh] No matter. They've come too far too fast. They're close, but I'm ready. Oh, yes. The thing that will end these brats is already among them. [evil laugh] [squawking] I beg you, be careful, Lord. It takes a great deal of power to transform this creature, especially at such a distance. [evil laugh] Starboard ballasters, shackles, steamballs, port ballasters. There's the engine and cloud uptick. When will you return my sword, pirate creature? Easy, champion. I think this is going our way. Eh, up to the captain, but I warn you, he's a harsh man. Meanest of us all. - Man: Billows! - [whistle blows] [creaking] Why aren't the crew at their stations? Visitors, Captain. Or stowaways. Meet Captain Nimbeard. Greetings. I am Niko. I am here to defeat the darkness. I don't know you. My name is Lyra, princess of-- Don't know you, either. But you. We have met before, no? The Cumulus Caverns? The Deluge Bazaar? The Sky Market? [Italian accent] Uh, no. I do not think so. Captain, see what this one wears around his neck. A skywhale tooth. The sacred secret symbol of the sky. I had a skywhale tooth necklace once, given to my by my own Captain Calumny when I was a first mate. [gasps] Calumny. Now there was a gentleman of opportunity. - He was-- - Let me finish. He told me to never, ever, ever, ever give this necklace to anyone who was unworthy. I would like to see your necklace, Captain. Is it like mine? Let me finish! Of course, I never gave the necklace away. A conniving creature stole it from me! Well, it's all well and good, this story about a devilishly handsome merchant who may or may not have taken your necklace-- Ahh, Mandok! Mandok the mendacious. Ha! Good to see you, chum. No, it isn't. He's the filthy vermin that stole my necklace! And that's it! [all exclaiming] Get the drop boards! [clattering] But on the plus side, we do give you your choice of board. [groans] Ladies first, of course. Captain Nimbeard, I assure you, you're making a terrible mistake. [grunts] Up you go, sonny. [nervous chuckle] One to a customer, old pal. Shame to see you go so soon. I was just thinkin' that same thing. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! Wow! [stammering] I beseech you, ladies and gentlemen of opportunity. Return my sword of light to me now! We must reach the Curse-d Volcano. Is that where you're heading, the poisoned sky? I think we're doing these three a favor making them hop the drop. [laughing] Any last words, folks? You don't have to say it. This is all my fault. It really isn't. Stole the grackleflint egg, led us into the Shattering Spring, got us mixed up with cloud pirates. Mandok, we'd never blame you for honest mistakes. You don't know. I'm the real traitor. [gasping] Nar Est, he captured me, and let me tell you, he is really scary. I had to say I'd be a spy for him just to get out of there! [all exclaiming] - What?! - You've been spying on us! No! Not really. Spying's a negative term. Okay, a little, maybe. [gasping] Hangin' around with you two, and seein' you lookin' out for each other, even lookin' out for me, I couldn't do it. All: Aww! So I double crossed Nar Est. [gasping] That's how bad I am. I am a double double crosser. Uh, this is very surprising, Mandok. But he has also proven himself over and over. Mandok is our friend, Lyra. I know it. You're right. And considering the circumstances, we forgive you. All: Aww. Well, that's a load off my back. Uh, Mandok, what's wrong with your back? [gasps] Ooh, a ping beetle! That's gotta be how Nar Est is tracking us. Get it off me! Somebody step on it. - Eww, eww! What's that? - That looks like a ping beetle. [grunting] Unwelcome parasite! [thunder rumbling] Now, my little tracker, rise! Rise, my Shiraggo! Rise and destroy them all! Fun's over, folks. Hop 'til you drop! [grunting] I will do neither, belligerent foes! [gasping] There's no need to cower. I wish your respect, not your fear. Uh, Niko-- I sense we are in danger. [screeching] [thunder rumbling] [screeching] Battle stations! Battle stations! Don't just stand there if you can fight. [indistinct yelling] Lose it in the clouds! ♪♪ [thunder rumbling] [screeching] Poofhilda! Hard up to port! [grunting] Down starboard! Get us away from that thing! [grunting] - Whoa-ho-ho! - Mandok, where are you going? Perhaps you've noticed the giant tentacles! Ooh! These pirates will never be able to stand against this creature. We must help them. Shatter blast! [screeching] [grunting] [grunting] [screeching] Captain, we can't let it get hold of the ship. Ballasters! Where are my ballasters? Ballasters ready, Captain! - Nimbeard: Open fire! - [canons blasting] [screeching] [screaming] [grunting] [yelling] [croaking] [grunting] [screeching] Hah! Tentacle detangler! It felt that. Poofhilda! Hard about! Get us out of here! - [thunder cracking] - [screeching] [steam hissing] Captain, another hit and the mast comes down. Ballasters reload and fire when ready! Repair crew, on deck now! [croaking] - You! - Captain, I know that we  are not on the best ter-- Let me finish! I want you on the rail, ready to fire that sword. We need to protect the mast at all costs! Aye-aye, Captain. [screeching] The mast! [grunts] Huh! [grunts] [grunting] Creature closing fast, Captain. Ballasters! Fire! [canons firing] [screeching] Hurricane force! Nimbeard: Again! He's gone under! [screeching] [screaming] Brace yourselves! [grunting] [screeching] [gasping] Nimbeard! Look out! [grunting] Mandok! I was diving for cover and you got in my way. [screeching] [indistinct yelling] Darkness, be gone! [screeching] I need to get closer! Hai-yah! Niko! No! - [yelling] - Yeah, that a boy, Niko! [grunting] Darkness, be gone! - [gasping] - Niko! Flicker! Just in the nick of time! And... you have grown. Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! [trilling] [grunting] But not quite big enough! [indistinct yelling] [gasps] [screaming] There! That's the heart of its darkness! We need to go up. Way up! [trilling] [screaming] The sword of light speaks! [screeching] Darkness, be gone! [screeching] [explosion] [gulping] Way to go, Flicker! [cheering] [cheering] [groaning] Ahh! Typical. It'll be okay, Lord. Why don't we put some antlers on an unsuspecting creature? Ahh. Yes. You always know how to cheer me up, Rasper. [croaking] [purring] Whoa. [chuckles] Good bug. You're really big now. Niko, my boy. You saved my ship. You can keep the necklace. And as for you, Mandok. Yeah, yeah, I know. Hop and drop. Can we just get on with it? Let me finish. Turns out, you're a good egg after all. Saved my life and all that. You can go on down to the hold, and take any little bit of treasure you like. [gasps] Uh, thank you, but the safe passage is more than enough. - Ohh. - Yes. Once you have taken us to the Curse-d Volcano, we will defeat the darkness. Once and for all! I won't take my ship into poisoned sky. One of Nar Est's beats almost scuttled me. But that is our mission. Why don't you join my crew? Thank you for the kind offer-- But we have plans to defeat the darkness. Eh! Ground lubbers. We've brought you as close as we dare. This lifeboat will get you the rest of the way. Favorable breezes, Mandok. No treasure? All four of us on this little dinghy that only runs on clouds? Good thing I'm not in it for the reward. - [trilling] - Oh! ♪♪ Noble skyfolk, farewell! [grunting] Honestly, Captain. What do you think their chances are? Slim to none, Billows. Slim to none. ♪♪ You know, I'd have left me behind with the pirates. No more of that talk, friend Mandok. Honestly, if I had known you'd been taken by Nar Est's servants, I'd have left you at the Tumbledowns. - See? - Let me finish. And Jackal would have gotten Niko's sword. Everything would have ended. Mandok, you've more than proven whose side you're on. [trilling, spitting] [screeching] [loud clank] That does not sound like a good kind of noise. [engine sputtering] We're out of clouds. Yes. It is a beautiful blue day. Our quest is sure to come out right. No, Niko. No clouds means no fuel. No fuel and this thing will drop like a-- [screaming] [grunting] [groaning] [grunts] At least we are much closer to the Curse-d Volcano. Yeah. And at least there is nothing in these parts that's trying to crush us. [growling, roaring] ♪♪ Chirp.
