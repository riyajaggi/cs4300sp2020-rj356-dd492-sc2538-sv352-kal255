 I hope so. - [growling] - Aah! Aah! Both: Uh-oh. ♪♪ [theme] I'm Niko, and this is my Sword of Light! I am here to free my people and defeat the darkness forever! "From the Sea of Suffering to the Faraway Shore." [growling] [burbling] Mm-mm! Mmm! Look, Cecil, drylanders.

 Hey, what are they doing, Norm? Mm-mm-mm! I think they want to play charades. Oh, drylanders dancing. Drylanders flailing. - Mm! - Drylanders drowning? Oh, you are both terrible at this. [gasp, exhale] [spitting] Say here! Personal space! [exhale] Sorry about that. Needed the air bubble. Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Ptoo! How rude! Niko, are you all right? [gasp] Yes. How did you know those fish make magic bubbles? We had puffer-huffers in the castle pool. These bubbles can last a week or more. Now let's see where we are. Mm. Which way do we go? [rumbling] [growling] Did you hear or see something? Something large and whooshy? [growling] Wherever we are headed, we must not linger here. Look. A light. Maybe it's a village. I just hope they're friendly. [knocking] Who goes there? Hello, curious undersea creature. I am Niko. Could you open the gates and let us in? Just let you in? I'm not falling for that a seventh time. Hey! Wait! Please. I'm Princess Lyra of Carondolet. - Princess Lyra? - Oh, Princess Lyra. You said your name was Niko. I can't let a liar through the gate, not for a fourth time. I am Niko. You just said your name was Princess Lyra. No. I'm Princess Lyra. He's Niko. What the-- How does anyone tell you two apart? Open the gate, Captain! It is Princess Lyra. ♪♪ [fanfare] See? That's her image on these shiny discs that the drylanders send us during storms. Why they sink their boats to do so, I haven't the murkiest. Princess Lyra, I am so deeply honored to meet you. Over here. How ingenious to spawn a twin to foil assassins! I, King Scampi XLIV, greet you. I greet you, King Scampi of the Shrimp Folk. Let our nations join in a friendly backstroke. [laughing] Princess Lyra you indubitably be. Ride on my throne coach, and the kingdom you shall see. Heh heh. Not bad. Ooh! Can we? And away we flow! Hyah! Kino: [whooping] [whooping continues] Yeah! Whoo-hoo! [groan] Coming through with royal apologies. Amazingness. Uhh. I may be sick if it gets any more amazing. Oh. We have a diplomatic bucket for that. Keep it as a gift. [groaning] King Scampi, if I may, we're on our way to the Pools of Destiny, but we've gone a bit off course. Can you tell us where they are? Lackaday, I don't know much about the drylander world. It's a little too, uh, dry for me. [laughing] That's very good. But my Dolphin Queen knows everything about the drylander world. Excellent, Your Excellence. We must speak with her at once. Unfortunately, she's gone, Princess. Years ago, my beautiful Dolphin Queen was taken by the Mantagore, an evil monster with gnashing teeth, fearsome claws, and the most terrible ear wax. Then we must save her. And so we shall, as I have a plan to do just that. After a dinner in the Princess' honor, let us chitchat. What a day. And we get to keep the bucket. Oh. Oh. I feel so little and runty. I can't wait for Nar Est to curse us again. Mandok: While we're sharing feelings, would you mind carrying me instead of dragging-- Oof! Ow! [grunt] Let us through! We have important business with Nar Est. Ah, you three are sketchy-looking, even for here. Listen, you, we're a terrible darkness-infused three-headed creature. Don't mess with us. [snarl] Ha ha ha! Well! Why don't you try to force your way in? All right, we'll go and tell everyone you were the reason Nar Est didn't get this incredibly valuable prisoner. - Mandok: Hey, will you-- - I'm sure he's real forgiving. [gulp] Yeah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Ha ha ha ha! [gurgling] Niko: [laughing] Keep your mind on the mission, Niko. But should we not pause from time to time on our journey to enjoy these wondrous sights? [sigh] Fine. Here's me enjoying this wondrous seaweed chair. Tell me, how do you know that swim dance? Have you been here before? No. And it's called a "swance." Father had me learn 90 million customs from around the world. He never guessed I'd be anything important. To him I was still his little girl. Yet he did make sure you knew that very dance we needed today. Ow! Let me go! Let me go! I also learned not to stick my hand in a mugger clam. [knocking] You have won this round, trickster mollusk! Pray I do not put you to the test a second time. [gurgling] Tell Princess Lyra her presence is requested at the banquet. You may also attend, lackey. I'm Princess Lyra. Unclam me, you beast! Have at you! In honor of our guests, a shrimp toast. We welcome Princess Lyra and her identical twin. If other people kick you out, we will always take you in. Ha ha ha ha! That's not bad. And now we dine. Delicious. Your Highness, how do you know the Mantagore has the Dolphin Queen? She went missing the very day the beast appeared. It was no coincidence, I tell you. Worry not. The rescue plan we've been rehearsing is quite foolproof-- at least to a fool like me. Ha ha! That's really good. Aw. Well, then, since you're finished, let me bedazzle you with our devious stratagem. The Dark Jewel-- my greatest treasure, my greatest hope, Once I have that missing shard, everything will be coming up Nar Est. And all the world will tremble before your might, Lord. Ha ha ha ha! Ahem. Uh, excuse me, Your Lord High Evilness. Uhh. Unbelievable. A gaggle of bumpkins can waltz through the catacombs and pass the guards just to chat me up? Is this what it's come to? Rasper, dispatch them. Aah! Uh, Lord Nar Est, this is the sidekick of that hoo-man you're looking for. The one with the glowy stick. And the sometimes floaty friend. Aah! [snap] The champion's sidekick. Is this true? Absolutely not. So since there's nothing I can help you with, I'll move along. Useless. You can eat that, Rasper. [chuckling] Hey! I called dibs! Did I not call dibs? Ow! Wait! Wait! Now I remember. I am the champion's sidekick. Oh, the sidekickiest of all sidekicks. Me, Lyra, Niko, we go way back. Hmm. Despite your slack-jawed appearance, you three have done well. Hear that, boys? This is where we get our reward. ...and 2. And 1 and 2 and 1 and 2. And left, right. Shake it, don't break it. And big finish-- jazz hands. And that is how we'll defeat the Mantagore. You move in formation well. That's a plus. I know. We do do that well. But what clever strategies have you planned for battle? Battle? I'm not familiar with the word, although it is fun to say. Battle. Battle. Battle, battle, battle. Say it, everyone! Battle! Battle! Battle means fighting, good King Scampi. Oh, no. We shrimp folk never fight. We live in peace, like the deep at night. The tide rolls in, the tide rolls out. The ebb and flow is what we're about. Ha ha! That's a good one. But how in the deep do you plan on rescuing the Dolphin Queen from a monster? By singing, of course.

You can train us to be victorious like your champions? Uh, the point is I can make you more effective. Then hurrah hurray! We're coming for you, my Dolphin Queen! So, uh, Lord Nar Est, [chuckle], seeing that we brought you the sidekick, we were thinking that we could get, I don't know, some kind of reward? A what? Long ago, you turned us into a vicious three-headed beast, but the nasty hoo-man uncursed us. We were way better before. Can we be remonsterized? Please? I thought I recognized you. Initiative. I like it-- to a point. [growling] [laughing] [laughing] [growling] - You're the best. - Thank you so much. Can we keep the poncho? Let's you and I talk, hmm? Kyra: Lunge! Block! Right claw! Left claw! - Tail whip! - Hah! Good! Do not relent! Aah! Aah! Aah! Oof! - [groan] - [squeal] You win this round, sneaky crustacean. Niko, take a look. Shrimp troopers, attention! Lunge! Block! Right claw! Left claw! Tail whip! And jazz hands. They insisted on leaving that in. Of course. Now let us save my queen. With your excellent tutelage, we cannot lose. Huzzah! ♪♪ [military drum beat] We shall distract the Mantagore while you rescue the Dolphin Queen from the beast's cave. Please remember what I've shown you. If there's trouble, you won't be able - to sing your way out of it. - Won't we? My shrimp troopers can be well nigh irresistible. That's the problem. Hail, beast! I, King Scampi XLIV, have come to reclaim my Dolphin Queen! Face me now! [growling] Something approaches. Let us hide. Raah! Steady on, troopers! Hold the line.

Only these ugly remains. - Speak for yourself, you sea ape. - Aah! If you're done being hysterical, could you get me out of here? Niko, help him. [grunt] Thanks, kid. Have you seen the Dolphin Queen? We are here to rescue her. What would she be doing in a place like this? I've been stuck here a long while, and it's just been the monster and me. I was too afraid to strike my light until you came.

Oh, my-- - Raah! - Oh, bother. It seems the tide will be rolling out today. You shall not harm the shrimp folk! Aah! Revolting sea beast, you will be destroyed! Turbulent tornado! King Scampi: Take aim! - Fire! - ♪♪ [harp chord] Raah! Don't forget jazz hands! Left claw! Right claw! And jazz hands! - [cheering] - Hurray for jazz hands! What news? Did you find my queen? I'm sorry. She wasn't in the cave. Impossible! She swam into the cave. Darkness fell, and then the Mantagore swam out! It's circling back! Aah! Wait. Did darkness fall like nighttime, or was it a sort of momentary darkness? Darkness fell into the sea and flowed into the cave. Is that important, Princess Lyra? Now you get my name right. Niko! Ohh! Lyra: The Mantagore's cursed! You can cure it! It would be my pleasure. Hi-yah! [roaring] The Sword of Light will quiet your howl. Darkness, begone! [squeal] [chattering] Oh! A thousand thanks! I am freed! [chattering] Huzzah! Huzzah! O little Scamp! My Dolphin Queen! She's back again! This time, the tide's surely come in. Niko, bringer of light, please accept this green conch. A small token of our appreciation. And now we celebrate. ♪♪ My happy little Scamp. A finer swancer has never swum the seas. Now that you're back, I have an important question. Do you know where the Pools of Destiny are? Do I? I can bring you within a day's journey of the Endless Expanse. The Pools lie just beyond. Yee-ha! Faster! Stupendous awesomeness! Lyra! Forget your worries and enjoy this! I always say, Niko, uneasy lies the head that wears the crown, even delayed as her coronation may be. I understand none of that. The princess wants to become queen, yet it was all delayed by evil intent. A coronation? Yes. Your father had set the day. Didn't you know? Lovely invitations. See? He did think you were ready for important things. Father, thank you, Your Highness. [twittering] Flicker! Oh! You found us. And you're bigger. The Endless Expanse lies that way. But remember, what you find at the Pools of Destiny is not always what you were looking for. Niko: Goodbye, great Queen! Thank you! We're a little closer now. Then we continue. Onward! Oh! Ow! No, no! Oh! Ow ow ow ow ow! - Get him! - Make him talk! - How's he taste? Pathetic vermin. You'd be doing us both a favor if you gave in. After all, the end is in sight. I will reign supreme, and the entire world will cower at my feet. Sounds great. May I live to see it? Tell me what you know! Okay, okay! Last I heard, they were headed to the Pools of Destiny. The Pools. Of course. Lyra wants to turn her stripling brat into a real champion. That must be stopped. Hyah! Yuck! You taste awful. Oh! Can I go now, please? Ha ha ha ha. Yes. After I improve you, like your friends. I'd say we're more acquaintances. I'm thinking tusks. Yeah! Can't beat a big pair of tusks. Hold on! I am so, so honored, of course. And as great as those three-- or one-- are, they're dumb as a bar of brake iron. Thanks. - [growling] - Ow! Go on. Now I'm just spitballing and in no way telling you what to do, but I could serve you much better the way I am, don't you think? Ow! Please let that be a goodbye peck. No. It means you're with us now. You will report back to me with this. From this day forth, you are my spy. [laughter] Ohh. Chirp.
