 [screaming] Settle! Settle! If we're gonna play a real game of rockby, we have to do it proper by the rules. Agh! Who is it who's got the ball? [screaming] We should be not here. What are these creatures? Hill giants. The ball? We cannot have the ball until we have the field. It best be a regulation field. The field will be the size agreed on in the ninth conference of stones. The ninth conference? You mean the disputed conference? - There was no dispute. - I didn't agree. You weren't even there! - [twittering] - We're never gonna get down if they keep going like this. I've heard hill giants can argue for years. If I could just get their attention. Excuse me! Up here! Can you let us down, please? Do you hear me! Hah! What? Who did that there? - Hello. - Non-players on the field! Can you let us down, please? In good time, me wee pebble. First, the pigfort must knock one another down. Go and rub your head, Angus. Havoc. [chuckles] Bread melon. Hey! Settle. Remember? If you can't agree on the old rules, why not start fresh? - Start fresh? - Lyra: You know, make up some new rules. Just for now. You know, you might be on to something there. - New rules! - We don't need new rules  to play rockby. No new rules. - [indistinct chatter] - [grunting] Ahh! Niko! See here, Fergus, you great hillock. Niko! Are you okay? No! It is ruined! The most perfect of bread melons. We might have to make a run for it. Ohh. Did you just turf-ed me? So I did! All: [chanting] Turf! Turf! Turf! - New rules! - [grunting] [screaming] Lyra! Niko! Time to go. Hill giant: Shut up! [indistinct arguing] [screaming] [grunting] [grunting] Niko? Mandok! We lost him. We'll find our way back to him. I hope. I sense danger. Uh, is the tree eating Flicker? No. It's a cocoon. Some creatures make them when it's time to grow up. Good bug. Yuck! Lyra: We'll come back for him once we get our bearings. I think I know where we are. It's darker than I expected, and the trail needs repair, Niko, but-- Niko? There is no point in hiding, whatever you are. If you serve the darkness or you are the darkness, I will vanquish you. Huh? [gasp] Lyra:  "Lonsero ivana cuda  beckmorro shoulda." My father's mark! I knew it. This is the Shoulda Coulda Wood. Shoulda Coulda? It's a place that brings regrets to life in the form of visions. What are regrets and visions? Are they war like? Must we fight them? Regrets are memories... of mistakes you made. Things you wished you'd done. Or should have done. My father used to come here to make peace with the choices he made. Ahh. You seem worried. There are whole centuries of regrets that I don't want to revisit. Stay focused, and walk right by anything unusual you see. It's not real. Lyra, what is this mist? Oh. Here comes a memory, I bet. Everything's fine. Nothing we see can... hurt us. This is madness, your highness, pure madness. Who is that man, Lyra? My king, Minister Nar Est has been dabbling in shadow magics, and it can't be allowed to go on. If I may explain-- Your experiments are dangerous. To spawn a shadow in our great jewel, Carondelet would be corrupted with darkness. You are a learned fool, Sargous. There's no reason to fear the darkness, sire. When properly harnessed, it can make Carondelet strong. Invincible! Nar Est, you are playing with forces you don't understand. Enough! My brother squabbling with my closest advisor. I'll sleep on this dilemma. I bid you all goodnight. No, Father. Wait! You can't trust Nar Est. I should have made you listen. Lyra, wait! You said it wasn't real! Ah, that is draining. Was that Nar Est, the vile sorcerer whom I must defeat? He does not seem very dangerous. He was a monster then, and he's a lot worse now. Bread melon! Odd. That shouldn't be here. A bread melon tree needs open spaces. Not a bread melon tree, it is the  bread melon tree. The same tree that got squashed. Oh, havoc, is that your idea of a regret? I felt terrible when the giants crushed this most perfect of melons, Lyra. What are you doing? You can't eat the visions, Niko. They're phantoms, not real. They seem real enough to me. And quite ripe. Catch! That's-- That's very strange. We shouldn't be able to touch a vision. And it certainly shouldn't be able to touch us. They're real. Hey, wait a minute! Something's wrong. We need to find Flicker and get out of here. Now! [distant screeching] Lyra? [screeching] Lyra? Where are you going? [panting] Wait! [groaning] Belatha and I know every cure, physical or mystic, that is to be known. Belatha: But even we cannot say what caused the king's sudden affliction. Lyra, did you see that? I'll never forget it. Come on. [bleating] [clucking] And so that's my sad tale of woe. And why I'm prepared to offer a king's ransom in exchange for an oyster jelly pie. A frectorian sneeze bauble? No? How's about a match set of skunkworm tallow earrings? Ooh, ooh, the tuning key for a terpsichorean bladder horn? Cash. You will give us your best combo plate. Don't make us get rough with you. - [snorting] - [groaning] [grunting] I hate being little. Mandok: Okay, half a pie perhaps? Lyra, where are you? Lyra. [grunts] [panting] Lyra. I always warned my father not to trust Nar Est. I didn't do enough. Belatha: Lyra, we have decided. With your father gone, the circle has agreed to act as regents until you are of age. You will make a fine queen. - Someday. - But not now. Lyra! You're letting the visions of your memory suck you in. Again! Brave girl. Then we all agree. No, we do not. I do not agree. You cannot deny me. I was the king's trusted advisor. A regency? The crown should be mine. Minister, you are at best a mid level functionary. You will never take my father's place. Never! Perhaps not, girl. But mark my words, I will rule. If you so much as touch the great jewel with dark magic, there will be consequences. - Seize them! - [gasping] You shall not take us so easily, darkened memories. [grunting] - [metal scraping] - [grunting] [grunting] Hah! You must end this vision, Lyra. You don't understand. We have to stop Nar Est. Forest blast! [whooshing] He's heading for the great duel. I have to warn Uncle Sargous. It is not really him. This is forest trickery. If you want to help her, give me the shard. Give it to me! This may have begun as a memory, but Lyra cannot have a memory of you speaking to me. Witness my reasoning skill. Yah! The sword of light exposes your true form, tricky forest feature. Lyra! Stop! This memory is a trap. [laughing] Greetings, good creature. What'll you accept in exchange for a snipe sausage? Cash! Do I detect the slightest hint of flexibility? [snorting] I'll take that as a yes. Hey, isn't that the little mangy thing we met before? Shh! That little mangy thing is the "hooman's" sidekick. If we get him to Nar Est, we could trade him. I follow you, Doris. Uh-- [stammers] I don't follow you, Doris. Lump, you knot head, Nar Est will be so happy with us, he'll put us back together again. Eye of cantone? Sees two tarn, no foolin'. Firebat feather? Impossible to burn. No? How about-- A bop on the head and a ride in a sack? [laughs] Excuse me? Oh! Shoulda took the firebat feather. We need to get to the top of the tower to stop Nar Est. Lyra! Wait! [gasps, grunts] Uncle! Stay away from our precious jewel! [screaming] Nar Est means to harness our great jewel to make himself all powerful. [indistinct] Ahh! [grunting] [gasping] How nice of you to come, princess. The rule of Nar Est begins now! [speaking ancient language] He's done it. His dark magic is corrupting the jewel. Bast bethood! And now, to bring the darkness into this world! [evil laugh] Finally, I will rule! I'd rather destroy the source of our power than let you corrupt it for evil! [grunting] [growling] [grunting] [cracking] [grunting] [screeching] My beautiful jewel! What have you done? [screaming] [gasping] [grunting] [groaning] My body. I'm just a phantom! You've compromised the jewel. For that, I'll doom your world! - [screeching] - [evil laugh] [evil laugh] [screeching] [evil laugh] [screeching] [evil laugh] [rumbling] What is happening to the city? I thought it might come to this. Listen, child. I've built a chrysalis chamber far from here. Nar Est will never find it, but it needs a piece of the great jewel to power it. Give it to me. My sword? Ha! I am amused, not fooled. It gives me the shard. Never! It gives it! [screeching] [thunder] Forest blast! - [screeching] - [laughing] [evil laugh] [evil laugh] [blowing] Carondelet. I've never seen this from the outside. All of humanity imprisoned. So small and fragile. I have your city, your people, and soon I'll have everything. You failed, princess. That little shard is nothing. You might as well give it to me. - Lyra. - Niko? You have not failed. No. No, I haven't failed, Nar Est. You never got this. Uh-- That! Just one sliver of light chases away a lot of darkness. That shard will defeat you. We will defeat you. [evil laugh] I'll be waiting. [echoing] Lyra, what happens when you stop regretting a regret that you regretted? - This. - [branch cracks] [screaming] [grunting] Great job, champ. We're free of the vision. [grunting] I sense we are not out of the woods yet. [laughing] Hah! Hah! It gives it. [gasps] You are the darkness I have been sensing. - [laughing] - It's the reason  these regrets are real. [laughing] Ahh! Ahh! - Ahh! - Ahh! [laughing] This path is no path at all. Lyra feara. Niko weako. [laughing] Skayma gave a show, but it didn't clap. Master will be cross. [growling] Master? You mean Nar Est. [gasping] We watch for four or two or three. With darkness, he will mold us. Milord says give them up to me. The albatross foretold us. Is-- Is that a clue or poetry or-- Princess champion! [screeching] Shard. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. [evil laugh] So true. You are the strangest sort of cursed woodland creature. A creature made of woodlands here to trap us with Lyra's many mistakes. - Hey! - But you cannot! She is wise and good. With pretty hair. It didn't clap. It must stay until master sends for it! Wah! [grunting] [laughing] Master will be pleased. I will not be contained! [chomping, spitting] Ouch! [grunting] And now I will cure this place. Darkness, be gone! Is Skayma here? Or is us everywhere? Where to strike. What to hit. How to cure a forest. [screaming] Where do I strike you? Shockwave! [laughing] Hoorah! A spray of petals upon it. Skayma, Nar Est is using you. He is my master, as I am your master. [grunting] It's no trick to control you. So many regrets inside you. [Niko grunting] You are helpless in a trap of your own making, princess. Sorry, Skayma. I've made peace with my regrets. I did what I could. And I'm not done! Hahh! [grunting] Come, Lyra. Give your father a hug. Father. Lyra! [groans] Almost got me, Skayma. This must be where your power is strongest. Niko, strike here! No, it tricksies us. [grunting] Darkness, be gone! [screeching] Kabloom. [screeching] Oh, bread melon. [giggling] Hah! [grunting] [groaning] You cured the forest. They really are just visions now. Aww. [twittering] Will we ever see Mandok or Flicker again? I hope so. Goodbye, Flicker. This is a good place for a buttermunk to grow up. At least, it is now. [twittering] - Ohh. - Oh... Okay. If only we could stay to see what Flicker becomes. But we must continue to the Pools of Destiny, and see what I become. [giggles] Or maybe we could make a cocoon for me. [gasps] Do you see her, too? Who is she? Another regret, Niko. Not important. We cannot very well have a rock battle until we have a field. More hill giants! Who said hill giants? [indistinct chatter] Enough. Oy! You! We're mountain dwarfs. There's a great difference. - Yes. - That's right. You look just like them. You both play rockby. Mountain dwarfs invented rockby! We play it classic mountain rules. With a rock! No, not classic. Classic abridged. With a rock. Abridged! Do you take me for a clay head? Oh, havoc. - Turf! - Turf! - [grunting] - Oy? Uh, hello! Hi! Before the fun begins, perhaps you could direct us to the endless expanse? What's that? Speak up, lassie. My ears are full of iron. The hill giants flung us this way. - They did? - Typical. Yes. We went miles in the wrong direction. Well, why didn't ya say so? - Ahh! - [gasps] [screaming] Scarpe, you great alp. That's not where she wanted to be thrown. Oh, don't take that tone with me! All: [chanting] Turf! Turf! Turf! [screaming] Both: Uh-oh! ♪♪ Chirp.
