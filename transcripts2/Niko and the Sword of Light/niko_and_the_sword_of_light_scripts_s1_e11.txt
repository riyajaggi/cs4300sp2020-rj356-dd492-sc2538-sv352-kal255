 Let's take these three down to size. - Darkness, be gone! - [screaming] [grunting] - [heavy footsteps] - Ohh! Hey, we've all been through a lot lately. Maybe we could work this out. By the way, the new tail. Very impressive. All the better to beat you with. - Ahh! - [trilling] [lasers firing] Meanwhile, I'll duck in here and see what I can dig up, to, uh, help. Sonic slay! [growling] Nice noise maker you got there. Noise maker? - [growling] - Lyra: [grunting] Heeya! Huh! I could do this for hours. But I won't. [screaming] - [grunting] - Lyra! - [groans] - You fight valiantly, Lyra, but their new bigness has increased their indestructibleness as well. Strategic withdrawal  anyone? [growling] - Flicker! - [trilling] [grunting] [growling] [panting] Wait! Ahh! Not in there. [growling] - We goin' after them? - Don't have to. They just dove into a colony of Exuber Ants. They're gonna be chewed to bits. Ha! They'll wish they were only gettin' chewed to bits. - [trilling] - [groaning] This is a terrible place to hide. [echoing] Excuse me, but when it comes to craven hiding, I am something of an expert. [whispering] And being very quiet is a key part of the whole undertaking. I don't hear any screaming. Guess the Exuber Ants ain't found 'em yet. Let's make sure they do. [stomping] [rumbling] What is that unpleasant noise? Not the boomy one, the scratchy one. Havoc. [chittering] Exuber Ants! Whatever you do, don't let them bite you. Mandok: Always my favorite option. This way. - [growling] - [grunting] Not that way. [Flicker screeching] [trilling] My thanks, faithful Flicker. You know that leads deeper into the nest, right? I shall clear a path. Shovel strike! [ants screeching] [growling] [screeching] Hah! Hah! - [screeching] - [gasping] - [grunting] - [screeching] [gasping] Lyra! - [grunting] - [screeching] [screaming] [groaning] Lyra, are you injured? The Exuber Ant bit me. More are coming. I must help you. No! Once the venom kicks in, I'm a danger to all of you. Leave me. I shall never abandon you. Flicker. Mandok. Help us. [trilling] [hissing] [whimpering] A sunlight flare will blind them. Yah! It won't work. They already can't see. [grunting] Yet, they have very good aim. Lightning strike! Lightning strike! - Lightning strike! - [screeching] [screeching] Fear not, Lyra. We shall escape, and find a way to heal that bite. No. Niko, there's-- there's no cure. The effect of the venom is permanent. Symptoms only get... worse. Princess, are you okay? Who, me? Never better. I'm great! Are you feeling any [distorted] effect from the venom? Hey! Champ, champ, champ! I got a great idea. Run this way. Huh? [screeching] Ha ha! Missed me! Too slow! The venom makes her love danger too much. Whoa! Is that even possible? Yes. They have words for it, like reckless, heedless, and impulsive. Gotcha! [screaming] [laughs] Oh, toughen up, will ya? We've got fightin' to do. [yelling] Ahh! You couldn't have done that before? Champ, champ, champ! Way to go. Those Exuber Ants can't follow us now! They don't have to. You said it yourself. They live down here. Ooh! And you know what else lives down here? The dreaded Diggantis. - Diggantis? - [gasping] Diggantis, fabled terror of story and song? [singsongy] That's the one. Hoarder of treasure? Eater of warriors? Treasure, warriors. You know the legend well. I know we should avoid this legend at all costs. [gasping] Oh, silly! We will defeat it in glorious battle. And seize the spoils of victory! She is more excited than usual. Perhaps that will prove useful when we reach the Cursed Volcano. [trilling] Yeah, sure, if by "useful" you mean "guaranteed to attract grievous and irreparable boo-boos!" [sniffing, grunting] Still not smelling the "hooman." Well, keep sniffin'. If the Exuber Ants haven't gotten them by now, then we still gotta get 'em. Mandok: Doesn't she ever slow down? See? Let's go after 'em. But we'll get bitten. [grunting, whimpering] Then grab some vines, make a rope, and we'll use that to snare 'em. Niko: She cannot have gone too far. That's him. Got him. Pull it up. Pull it up! [straining] - [screeching] - [screaming] Lump: Let it go. Let it go! Champ, champ, champ. Look at this. It's a nursery! [shouting] Lyra, use your tunnel voice. This is my tunnel voice! Woo! Lyra, you're not being like you. I know! Great! Now, let's go hunt down that Diggantis. Who's with me?! Lyra, forget Diggantis. We must focus on our mission. [gasps] Oh, mission. Right. I know it is hard, but you must find a way to think clearly. Clearly. Check. We must prepare to do battle with the villainous forces of Nar Est. Villainous. Boooo. It is the only way to save your people. Is that clear? Mm... mm-hm. Blah! Blah! Check me out. I'm an ant. [screams] Lyra! What are you doing? [laughs] You look like you sneezed. Where's Flicker? [trilling] He's cocooned himself again. [growling] [screeching] - [gulping] - Feeding time. Shhh. [hissing] [growling] Let it smell the goo. Shh. [growling] [chuckling] Whew. - Stupendous! - [gasping] Lyra's smeary trick worked! [growling] Shouldn't have talked, right? - [screeching] - Hai-yah! Lyra: [yelling] There they are. We'll flood 'em out. Now all we have to do is wait. Ha! [gasping] [screaming] [grunting] Ow. Whoa! [laughing] Wah! Woo! Lyra! Hold on! Uh-oh. Lyra: Wah-hoo! Woo! Ahh! [laughing] [whimpering] - [gasping] - [whimpering] [screeching] Niko? Princess? Oh! - [gasping] - [coughing] Wah-hoo! - [screaming] - Wah-hoo! [screaming] - Whoa-oh-oh! - Wah-hoo! [laughing] [screaming] [grunting] Ha-ha! Nice steering. I'm also happy that the water washed off that baby ant goo. I did not care for how it felt. Or smelled. Or tasted. Ooh! Look at that. Wah-hoo! Lyra! What is this wondrous place? I know! It's the lair of the dreaded Diggantis! Which we should definitely not disturb by being so loud. Legend says somewhere in that pile is a magic suit of armor which, if you wear it, makes you invincible. Invincible but not inedible. Now may we run? Not without that suit. Lyra, you have always been the wise one who sees all the angles. Hey, I see all the angles. Who sees and then chooses wisely. Oh. As you said, the life force of Carondolet fades even as we speak. That is why more than ever I need-- We need the old Lyra back. Okay! Good talk. Lyra. No. You might alert the beast. [grunting] It must be here somewhere. With the most awesomely invincible armor, we can't lose. Yet if Diggantis finds us going through his things, he might be enraged. [grunting] Mmm. [growling] [roaring] Diggantis! [grunting] Lyra mounts a surprise attack! [screaming] Uh, Lyra regrets her decision. I shall protect you. Fire blast! [roaring] [screaming] Lyra: Oh, that's not good! Come on, Doris. This ain't workin'. Yeah, we're still too big to fit. Either we go down there and get the "hooman," or we face the wrath of Nar Est. [grunting] ♪♪ [rumbling] - [laughing] - [screaming] Hey. Here they come. Grab 'em! [grunting] Why didn't you grab him? Well, I thought you had him. - Uh-oh. - Huh? - [screaming] - [grunting] Who's up for the wrath of Nar Est? - Whoa. - Aw, man. The big armor room? Oh, Diggantis has been running us in circles. [rumbling] Let me at it! Wah! Ah! Ahh! Silence, trespassers! Whaddaya know. It's talks. Now you'll pay for your impudence. Oh, I'll show you whatever you just said. [grunting] Ah! [grunting] [roaring] Watch out, Lyra! Searing torch! Uh... uh, Lyra? [grunting] That invincible armor's gotta be in here somewhere. Ahh! [roaring] [screaming] - [yelling] - [grunting] [gasping] New plan. [groaning] Huh? Attack its underbelly. That's its only weak spot. Lyra, no! The Diggantis is right. We are the trespassers. The ant venom has confused you, and put us all in danger. I got your danger right here! [grunting] Somebody needs a time out. [grunting] I am sorry for Lyra's behavior. I ask that you let us go in peace. Uh! You warriors never leave me alone. You break into my cave, you try to steal my treasure, and then attack me? Nuh-uh. No. Too late for apologies. Then I shall take another approach. [growling] What's he doing? What's he doing? I can't watch. [growling] [groans, growls] Go, Niko, go! Fight, fight, fight! Oh, it's crunching him like an overripe nectaroon. Hm-hm. Hm-hm. [chuckling] [laughing] Ah! Oh, stop! Oh, no! Behold. The opposite of attack. Tickling instead of tackling. Never heard of that. Diggantis: [laughing] I do what I must to succeed, even if it means not fighting. Now there's a first. With everyone else, it's hit, hurt, attack. I'm fed up with it, I tell ya. - [chomping] - Ahh! - Exuber Ant bite? - Mm-hm. Too bad. She'll only get worse. Lyra is my friend. I will never give up. There must be a cure. Oh, that's very touching. Noble, even. Okay. You, with the ears. - Hmm? - Fetch that bottle. One dose of that and she'll be good as new. We do not wish to battle you. Our only desire is to defeat the darkness of Nar Est. Ooh! You're gonna fight Nar Est, that evil so-and-so? Oh, then you need, uh, lemme see-- - [clattering] - Ooh, way over the-- No. Uh, yeah, you need the Armor of Eccles the Impervious. Ah! Come on! Gimme! Want it! Uh-uh-uh-uh. You may have the cure or the armor, not both. Oh! Armor! Come on, mini Mohawk! Get the armor! [shuddering] [coughing] Ahh! Ahh. Oh, no. Well, this is embarrassing. Well played, sir. So, you'll give him the armor anyway, right? One per victor, small edible creature, unless you want to try your luck. Uh, I think we're good. Thank you for curing me, Niko. But you should have taken the armor. It might have been useful, but I have learned that what is on the inside is what counts even more than what is on the outside. That is a very grown up choice. Huh! With you runnin' around like a knucklebird, what else could he do? It was an easy choice to make. We are a team. No, more. A family. Aww, you guys slay me. Not literally. Thank you for your help, large new friend. Now, could you show us a way back to the above ground? I'll even dig you a new tunnel. Lovely offer, except there's a certain three-headed creep crawling around up there waitin' for us. That is also true. So, may we ask you another favor? You think Nar Est's gonna be mad at us for not catching the "hooman"? Ah, no, he'll be fine with it. Of course he'll be mad! He'll tear our heads off. [rumbling] [growling] [screaming] Oh, no! No! It hurts! I can't feel my legs! Ow! [groaning] [spitting] [gasping] [gasping] Ahh! [gagging] Oh! Pain. Bones. Broken. Chewed up. I'm slipping away. Fading. Ohh. [grunting] Those who dare challenge Diggantis become my lunch! We're not scared of you. [roaring] But since you did do our work for us-- [nervous chuckle] - [growling] - [screaming] [chuckling] [grunting] Perhaps the larger creatures can lend a hand? Thank you, large friend. You make a very convincing devourer. Yeah, but my acting really sold it. Go in peace, warrior. Gee, it feels good to say that. Niko, I'm sorry that I wasn't more help through all of this. I'm the one who is sorry, Lyra. It is my fault that you were bitten. Hey. Maybe a little my fault, too. Bygones, right? Indeed. For now I know that I can be my own guide. And mentor. And win! Doris: We return in triumph, your Lordness. The "hoomans" have met a grisly end. - That's right. - We did good. So the Champion has been destroyed. Uh-huh. We saw it with our own 15 eyes. Ahh. Then how do you explain... this! Uh, we... can't. I thought as much! They're coming, Lord. Let them come. I'm ready. - [screeching] - [growling] ♪♪ Chirp.
