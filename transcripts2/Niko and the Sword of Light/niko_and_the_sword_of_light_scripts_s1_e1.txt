 Can't we talk this out? [snarling] I promise, you wouldn't want to eat me if you got to know me. - [growling] - Ahh! [whimpering] [snarling] Ahh! Oh! Oh! Ooh! - Ahh! - [growling] [screaming] [snarling] [grunting] [straining] Whoa.

 What kind of place is this? The craftsmanship. The luster. The ridiculous made up creature it depicts. Ooh, this is probably worth something. Maybe I'll take a souvenir. - [growling] - [screaming] [snarling] I'm usually more of a finders-keepers kind of guy, but in your case, I'm willing to share. [snarling] Ahh! [hissing] Fine. You can have it all. [howling, snarling] Ahh-haa! Ahh! [snarling] Ooh-hoo-hoo! Greetings, small creature. What is this place? [gasping] [panting] The champion has awoken. I must warn the elders. ♪♪ The champion has awoken. Princess, are you certain? I felt the chrysalis open, uncle. Let's get started. But this is too soon. Perhaps after so many centuries, the machine has malfunctioned. Trapped in here, it's more likely we'd lose track of time than my chrysalis would. No matter what has happened in the world, Princess, you must greet the mighty champion. Ready. Present this new hero with the shard. And should our champion fall, return with it to the safety of this castle. This time, we will win. So we have said, time and again. Yet Nar Est remains strong, and we are not restored. Good luck, your highness. Behold, champion. I am Lyra, princess of Corondelet. The hopes of all good beings in this fallen world are with you. I bear your sacred weapon. Champion? Did somebody loot the temple? Ahh! It wasn't me. It was him! [chomping] Greetings. I have partaken of these strange tree objects. They hang by their tails when they sleep. [chomping] Uhh-- [gulping] Whoo! Woo-woo-woo! What is that? No, uh, little boy. That's not for you. I'm looking for a warrior. Dressed like you. Can I hold it? No. At least I don't think it's for you. Are you... him? I am Niko. I have just awoken. And I must eat. [chomping] [sighs] What a mess. Elders, do you see what I'm seeing? It is chaos. Lyra, return at once. Um... Niko, don't move. I'll be right back. Any idea what she was talking about? Uh-uh. Me, neither. Mandok the Wise, at your service. Thanks for scaring off the Xerxes before. I owe you one. [distant howling] But we need to get out of here! But that floaty girl said to wait here. See, between the monsters and the floaty girls, it's not safe. Woo. [squeaking, chittering] Whew. It went the other way. [insects buzzing] [chomping] [spitting] These tree creatures are confusing. Don't eat fruit that's already on the ground. It is fruit! You are indeed wise. - Thank you. - And now we're even. So, what are you anyway? - I am Niko. - No, no, what are you? I mean, you look like a hairless Ungamunt. Only shorter. But Mandok doesn't judge. I am... confused. I know only that the darkness must fall. Whoo, you're tellin' me. It's a bad old world. I mean, this far away from the big volcano it gets livable, but, hm, less so every day. Yes! The cursed volcano. That is where I must go. Ha-ha, right. And I'll be carrying your banner right into the heart of darkness. Like a loyal sidekick. Oh. You're serious? [growling] - Ahh! - Run, Niko. Save yourself! - [growling] - [grunting] Nope. I misjudged the situation. Help! [growling] Be reasonable. Spare me and I am prepared to offer you a lint comb, three cubes of skunkworm tallow, and a decorative nodule. [growling] Okay, I'll throw in a skywhale tooth, only slightly cracked. [growling] Wait! I warn you, I have bad hygiene. - I'm probably-- - Hah! [growling] Fear not, Mandok! I will save you with my rotten fruit of reckoning. Huh? Hah! [cracking] Your thirst for woodland creatures will not be quenched today, odious beast! Run, you cluster nut! No one can beat Xerxes at feeding time. [growling] And it's always feeding time! [grunting] [growling] I see! We will circle back and sneak up on him using the element of surprise. Exactly. Except we're going to further confuse him by running in the opposite direction. [screaming] [grunting] [growling] We are fortunate to have escaped. What was that thing, anyway? Oh, your basic horrible pitiless creature. You can't throw a ring-tailed canoot around here without hitting a horrible pitiless creature. Don't tell me you don't know what a ring-tailed canoot is. How did you avoid getting your face eaten off? I do not know. So, uh, what about all that kickin' and flailin' around stuff? Is not everyone born with these skills? Nope. Irregardless, I owe you. Let me see... Here! This also covers any breakage back there in your boudoir. See ya! Good luck with the darkness! [growling] Maybe I can stick with you just a little while longer. The chrysalis has been shattered. This is beyond catastrophe. It is centuries old, Belatha. That isn't the princess's fault. She has led each champion to their doom, never coming close to defeating Nar Est. She is your sovereign. We rule in Lyra's name until she is older. She will not get any older. None of us will. With no way to create another champion now, humanity is imprisoned here forever. It's true I haven't won yet, but there's still one more champion. You would have us pin all our hopes on this child? Two children. I've been 14 for 768 years. Keep him hidden. Keep him safe. Do not tell him who he is. In several years, he might be ready. Good luck, princess. At once. Niko? Oh, havoc, where have you gone? A hundred to one. Is that all? I will hardly break a sweat. Hah! Hah! Hah! Juicy fruit foes  proved to be worthy opponents, but you shall never crush my will, army of under ripe  nectaroons! Hee-ya! [chomping] Even in defeat, you are delicious. Uh, you gonna share any of that with me, or do I have to beg? Apologies, friend. I propose you join me. Every warrior needs a sidekick. [chuckles] Sorry, kid, but I'm not exactly sidekick material. I'm usually running away from danger. [rustling] Something watches us. Ahh, just a frug beetle in the grass. [growling] No! I misjudged the situation! Huh! Hah! - What's it doing? - I don't know. Looks like a dancing mungbug after it's been stepped on. I am on a mission to defeat the darkness. Are you allies? [growling] Are you good? Oh, we're good, all right. Good and hungry. I'll just be over here doing some hiding. Perhaps a little cowering, too. [growling] How many times I gotta tell you two? You can't go around eating any old thing you corner. It's the cactu-rantula incident all over again. Both: Sorry, Doris. We share a stomach, remember? Come any closer, foul beast, and the only thing you will taste is the bitter sting of defeat. [laughing] Here's the plan. While one of us distracts him, the other two will sneak up and attack. Oh, that's good. Niko: [clears throat] You know I can hear you. [gasps] He knows the plan. Flab it! Chew him up! [growling] [grunting] - Hah! - [growling] Hah! [grunting] Hyah! Hah! - [grunting] - [screaming] [grunting] Beast, you are full of darkness. He's adorable. Please, can we eat him? - One bite? - Each? One bite. Then we wait a bit and see how he settles. [growling] Blah! [gasping] Be gone! I turn monsters into mush! Go and bother this boy no more. Blah! I don't want to be mush. Uh-uh. Leave the back legs to me. [screaming] And never return! The dumb ones are easiest to scare. Are you a ghost? Sort of. It's complicated. I'm Princess Lyra. Hey! Stop that. I'm your guide. A sort of mentor. [gasps] Like a sidekick? More like a babysitter. Well, it seems like you've got one sidekick too many, so-- Who is this creature? Hiya, sidekick. Mandok the unobtrusive. - [growling] - Ahh! On second thought, maybe I'll stick with you a little longer. These woods are full of unsavory elements. Come. Let our mission begin. Not a mission. Not yet. - [giggling] - Why are you  running through me? - Whee! - [sighs] Why are you not solid? And what is this interesting glowy rock thing? Definitely not for you. I checked. For now, we just go live somewhere. - Quietly. - Why? I found it best not to ask too many questions. Ahh. Lead the way, trusted sidekick. Hey, not a sidekick! When you address a princess, you need to-- [sighs] Just call me Lyra. Okay? - Come on. - Whee! - [giggling] - You're running  through me again. Now, last time I was out here, there was a nice, very safe forest over that way. Just beyond a bridge. Mandok: There used to be a bridge here. In my great-great grandfather's day. Lovely. We'll have to find another way-- - Hey! - [grunting] The decrepit structure is impassable for any. Except Niko! Witness my skill. [grunting] Whoa! I did not agree to this! - [grunting] - Niko, if you fall,  I can't catch you! - [grunting] - Whoa. [water splashing] [rumbling] Oh, havoc. Come on, you can make it. - [snarling] - Quickly! Ahh! [growling] My old enemy has returned. I will defeat you a second time! - [growling] - [grunting] Ooh! Eyes shut, eyes shut. Not your eyes, mine. Ahh, I peeked! [growling] You actually fought this thing? And lived? How? - We retreated. - Ahh. [yelling] - [growling] - [roaring] [growling] [clattering] [screeching] No, not him! Me! Oh, havoc. Niko! Elders, look. Belatha:  What have you done? I told you to keep him safe. [grunting] [grunting] I'm giving him the shard. Belatha: No.  He isn't ready. [grunting] [growling] [screaming] He needs it now! [grunting] [straining] Ahh! Niko! Huh! It is my weapon. [grunting] - Ow. - Not how it works. I sense that now. [growling] [cracking] [screaming] - Oof! - Uhh! [growling] Run, Niko! Save yourself. It's coming. Quickly. Activate your weapon. [grunting] [grunting] Hah! Hah! What do I do? I don't know. The other champions just did it. [growling] Ahh! [grunts] Ahhhh! [whimpering] - [growling] - [screaming] [growling] [screaming] Mandok! Help me! Lyra, I have it! Come on. I am Niko, and this is my sword of light! I am here to free my people, and defeat the darkness. Forever! [screaming] [sputtering] [yelling] Hah! Hah! [yelling] Shockwave! [screeching, growling] Wah! [screeching] Hah! Fireflash! Darkness be gone! [explosion] [screaming] [screeching] [twittering] Niko, my boy. You did it! [twittering] The Xerxes was a buttermunk. Not bad, champion. [groaning] [groaning] Uh... [growling] Hah! Hunger, take this! Hah! [chomping] [twittering] What is that creature? Is it a mutanasaurus? [chomping] [chuckles] No. Buttermunks can project your thoughts and memories. Very entertaining and delicious in soup. [twittering] [laughing] All right, no soup in the name of good fellowship. [twittering] [chuckles] He's grateful to us. You cured it, Niko. [twittering] Yet, I sense I have not defeated the darkness. [chomping] I have many questions, Lyra. If you like, I'll answer just one, but you need rest. Waking up and making one's weapon takes a lot out of any warrior. What did you mean by "other champions"? We're part of a centuries old struggle. At every third moon's  darkening, a champion is created to  defeat the evil sorcerer,  Nar Est. and every time,  they have failed. I failed them. [slurping] [yawning] I am the champion. We have to keep you safe until you're ready. In Nar Est's hands, your sword can destroy all hope. From now on, you'll have to do just as you're told. [snoring] [twittering] That is one pip of a bedtime story. [sighs] Push that off his face, would you? [ominous noises] Nar Est: Rasper, did you see that? [tapping] See what, Lord Nar Est? A shred of darkness just flowed back to me. One of my pets has lost his pizzazz. But that only happens when the humans are back. They're early. [cawing] What are my little prisoners up to? That stubborn girl has returned with another poor champion. So much devastation  on her hands. So many defeats. Does she really expect this time will be  any different? Let her try. I'll be waiting.
