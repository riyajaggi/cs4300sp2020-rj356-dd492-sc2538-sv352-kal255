 Previously on "Niko and  the Sword of Light"... Lord Nar Est, this is the sidekick of that "hooman" you're looking for. Ahh! Nar Est: You three have done well. - [growling] - Tell me what you know. They were headed to the Pools of Destiny. Lyra: Do you know where the Pools of Destiny are? Dolphin Queen: I can bring you within a days' journey of the Endless Expanse. - Ooh! - Dolphin Queen: The pools  lie just beyond.

 Nar Est: You will report back to me with this. - You are my spy. - Ohh. ♪♪ I am Niko, and this is my  sword of light! I am here to free my people,  and defeat the darkness. Forever! ♪♪ ♪♪ [thunder] Now that your princess has left with the shard, it won't be much longer until your pathetic magic runs dry. Darkness shall consume you once and for all. Will you stop that?

 One of these days it's gonna break. We have better ways to pass the time. The Champion. What are we gonna do about him, oh, great master of darkness? For now, not a thing. Our agent will see to that. And when he's through, that sword will be ours. The shard will be returned, and all the power of darkness will be mine! Don't you mean ours, Lord? No, Rasper, I do not. [wind blowing] Uh! Are you sure this is the way, Lyra? It is rather windy. The ovoid's brighter. This must be the path. The only way to the Pools of Destiny is across the Endless Expanse. And the only way to the Endless Expanse is through this canyon. What is this place? It's called the Tumbledowns. I've heard mention of it, but I've never seen it myself. It seems abandoned. No, we are being watched. [whispering] Listen carefully, Niko. - No sudden-- - Greetings, strangers. It is I, N-- [grunting] [muffled dialog] We are trying to get through this without any incidents, remember? [muffled] Sorry. [rumbling] Let me do the talking. Please excuse our trespass. We mean to travel to the Endless Expanse. [rumbling] Hey, you made it! - Mandok! - You found us! I knew my loyal sidekick would return. Sidekick? Let's not get carried away. Guide and companion. I'd even settle for exalted beacon of wisdom, if you like. May I introduce the Tumblebees. [overlapping greetings] - Howdy! - [gasps] This is Niko, the one I was telling you about. Greetings, good friends. [all exclaiming] Uh, and I'm Lyra. Actual princess. [all exclaiming] Ooh, they're anxious to meet you, too, your highfulness, but the Tumblebees  love a good story. What have you been telling people, Mandok? Until Niko is ready to battle Nar Est, we're extremely vulnerable. We need to keep a low profile. Ooh, I-- I really haven't told them anything at all. Is it true you defeated the Mugwhump? - And the Arachtaur? - And Xerxes? Uh, they're probably just jumping to conclusions. Lucky guessers. How do? Are you really the champion who will defeat the darkness? That is my quest, small prickly round creature. Well, I'm Dusty. This is my pa, Rusty, my cousin Musty, and my friends Bumpy, Rollie and Sticky. And that there is my grandpa Fred. Hey. How do? [chuckles] How do? These are friends, I assure you. Why, looky here at this cute little thing. [gasps] Let's give it a hug. Oh, you little snuggle bug. - Yeeha! - Oh! I'm glad you escaped those awful hill giants. Where did you go after that? Oh, therein lies a tale. Quite a story, actually. A real doozy. Remind me to tell you about it sometime. You want me to tell you about it now, huh? I want to hear everything. Well, I don't want to bore you with every little nugget. Let's just say I went to the Valley of Very Sadness. I-- I think that was the name. Maybe. There, inspired by Niko, I heroically rid the bazaar of marauding tent oysters. And there I heard it on good authority that Nar Est is sending someone after you. I knew you were heading for the Pools of Destiny, so I ran ahead to warn you. Nar Est has plenty of spies. Uh, exactly. Uh, we need to keep our sharp eye out for suspicious types. You can leave that part to me. Thanks, Mandok. We're lucky to have a friend like you. [metal clanging] Tumblebee: Oh, man. [chattering] Something is wrong? Night's comin'. We must get inside. - Quickly. - Listen to her. This is serious. - [gasping] - [laughing] [wind blowing] Friend Dusty. I sense we are hiding. Why is that? Every day at sunset, a foul wind blows in from the Endless Expanse, carrying with it the most cruel creature: the fearsome Prickletwister. [all exclaiming] Woe be to those who may get caught in its path of destruction and misery. - [all exclaiming] - Uh-huh. Sho 'nuf, man. [trilling] [trilling] Hey, watch it. Apparently, this twisting cactus snake has plagued the Tumbledowns  for generations. Hang on, cousins. Here it comes! Niko, stay back! But I wish to see this fiend. - [wind blowing] - [growling] There's someone out there. [gasps] He's right. Some poor traveler is caught in the Prickletwister's path. [growling] [roaring] [roaring] I must help him! Niko, wait! That is reckless. That is Niko. [growling] Shield of light! [grunting] - [roaring] - Yah! Huh? Yah! Lightning storm! Talon claw! Force blast! Look at him go. Rusty: That's some hero, all right. He's knockin' that twistery old thing back into the Endless Expanse where it belongs. Niko: Retreat, swirling fiend! [grunting] Get some light over here. Thanks, fellas. Niko! Are you hurt? I don't think so. Did we win? You battled the Prickletwister, and survived. [groans] This strange traveler and I make a good team. [gibberish] Perhaps my ears are broken. I do not understand these words. He's says, "Thank you for coming to his aid. "He would have surely perished alone." What can I say? I speak Howleese. - [gasping] - Well, that's  pretty impressive, - if I do say so myself. - He understood that. [gibberish] He says, "I appreciate the save, kid, "I'll be seein' ya." [gibberish] Okay, so he didn't say that. His people always repay their debts, so he humbly offers his services to you, brave warrior. [gasps] Like a sidekick? Well, no, not exactly like a sidekick. [gibberish] Okay, exactly like a sidekick. At last! My hero's wish has finally come true. You know, Niko my boy, I've been giving it a lot of thought, and I have decided I will become your sidekick after all. Apologies, small friend, but the position has now been filled. But you may be sidekick to the sidekick. I'll pass. Come on, Niko, let's not be too hasty here. We don't even know what's under that ominous cloak of his. - [all exclaiming] - Oh, adorable. Looks can be deceiving. Tell me your name, humble sidekick. He's a Howling, Niko. They don't have names. Is this true? Then I shall find you one! The perfect name. Uh... Danger Lord? Lightning Fur? Battle Hound? Hmm... Fluffy Hunk? The Prickletwister has been turned away. It'll be back. Oh, dry up, Cousin Musty. This calls for a celebration. [cheering] ♪♪ [indistinct chatter] Besides having my own sword, this is definitely the best part of being a champion. I've never seen an outsider so excited about our food before. Well, he is a growing boy. What will we be having? Breadmelon? Huskmelon? Nushberries? Go ahead, eat up. This is definitely the worst part of being a champion. [crunching] [trilling] Uh, excuse me, I'm scowling here. Now is really not a good time. I make my own schedule, you nit. Remember, the champion must not reach the Pools of Destiny, or you will pay dearly. All good, nothin' to worry about, gotta go, bye. - ♪♪[banjo] - [cheering] This is a song about a low down dirty varmint who got what he deserved. ♪ They call him traitor ♪ A despicable, miserable cheat ♪ ♪ They call him traitor [grunting] ♪ A backstabbin', horrible thief ♪ ♪ He chewed up our trust ♪ Smashed friendship to dust ♪ ♪ And mangled our goodwill to others ♪ [howling] ♪ He told us he'd changed ♪ And fingered the blame ♪ On evil that came from another ♪ ♪♪ ♪ They call him traitor ♪ A despicable, miserable cheat ♪ ♪ They call him traitor ♪ A backstabbin' horrible thief ♪ ♪ They call him traitor ♪ Traitor ♪ Traitor ♪ Traitor! ♪ Traitor! ♪ Traitor! ♪ Traitor! It's not my fault! [string pops] That your song is so wonderful. [cheering] [panting] [growling] The sword. - [growling] - Ah-ha! I knew it! You're just after the... deadly scorpion snail crawling up Niko's back. I'll let you get that one, Sidekick. [crunching, spitting] [gasps] He may be cute, but that is one tough hombre. ♪♪ Are you sure this quite possibly deadly climb is our only option? [grunting] - Ahhh! - [grunting] Ahhh! [growling] - [howling] - [screaming] - [grunting] - Thank you for-- Ahh! Cushioning our-- Ahh! Fall, prickly friends. [straining] [chirping] - Ohh. - [whimpering] Will you stop that? [grunting] [all exclaiming] - [screaming] - [grunting] Saved again. That is most fortunate. And sharp. [straining] [grunting] Whoa! Oh, thank you. That is just great. Leave me to get smooshed. [gibberish] Very funny. Why don't you get your own sidekick? There has to be another way through to the Endless Expanse. You could go around the mountains, but that would take weeks and weeks, and you'd have to get past the Stompin' Foothills. And the Smashing Boulder Bears. And the Sulfurous Tar Pits of Unending Agony. Maybe we should quit while we're ahead, and still have our heads. Who knows what could be waiting for us at the Pools of Destiny. And do we really need to go? How about the Hot Springs of Hallelujah? I hear it's very nice this time of year. We are finding a way through. Let's take a load off. Musty'll make us up some bumble-ade Can do-dee-do! ♪♪ Your city seems big for so few Tumblebees. Ah, the Prickletwister and others done took their toll. We're all that's left. ♪♪ ♪ Gloom and anguish ♪ Despair take hold of me Maybe not that number, Dusty. You know, Niko, we never had a hero around these parts until last night. You're awful lucky to have a champion for your people. Princess, I am confused. Am I not their champion, too? Technically, no. The champion's mission has always been to free our people. Human people. But everyone in this world suffers because of Nar Est. Should I not be the champion for them all? ♪♪ Lyra: You're right, Niko. Oh, I've been so selfish. All those years, never diverting from my mission. Think of how many we could have helped if I'd just bothered to look around me. Well, you're helping 'em now, aren't ya? I am. Thanks, Dusty. I shall be a champion for all the world! The light shall prevail! [howling] - Howly? - [growls] I will find you a name. This here's for you, Niko. A gift for our champion. I thank you for this small, round stick. [chuckles] It's a whistle, silly. There may not be a lot of us left, but if you ever need the Tumblebees's help, this'll let us know. - [no sound] - [all exclaiming] All: Too loud, too loud! Apologies, but I do not think it works. I think it works, Niko, but only they can hear it. [metal clanging] [gasping] We need to help these people. When the Prickletwister comes back through, I'll bet you can cure it. - I will not. - [gasping] But Niko, the Tumblebees need us. And we need the Prickletwister. - I have a plan. - You do? Oh, boy. ♪♪ [wind blowing] [gasping] Here it comes, Niko! I am ready! Dusty: Thanks. And good luck. And remember the whistle. Lyra: All right, now what? Strap yourselves in! - [grunting] - [trilling] [rumbling] [growling] [growling] [roaring] [grunting] Ahh! [grunting] [grunting] He needs help! What he needs is to give up this crazy idea. If anyone should be helping, it's that so-called sidekick of his. Where is he? Probably ran off to hide, and left us to our flying spike-filled doom. Ohhh. Sword splash! [grunting] Sidekick! Now! [howling] Yah! [yelling] [grunting] Oh, so you're coming too, then? [yelling] [screaming] Hang on, Niko! [yelling] Yah! I have it! [screaming] Yee-ha! - Ahh! - [howling] - [squealing] - Flicker! ♪♪ [cheering] Fare thee well, Niko! Don't forget to cure the Prickletwister! [screaming] You've got this, Niko! We're almost through. Yeeha! [whimpering] Please don't crash. Please don't crash. [gasps] So many stars. [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] Mandok, don't move! Wasn't planning on it. - [screeching] - [screaming] [grunting] Now your evil shall be dismissed. [grunting] There he is. This is our chance to impress the boss. We'll jump him when he least expects it. Ready. Set-- Darkness, be gone! I don't believe this. Curses. I missed. [grunting] [grunting] Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Whoa, whoa. - Uh, Niko. I am coming! [growling, screeching] [grunting] [growling] [screeching] Let the darkness be gone! Again! [screeching] There, small friend. Now you are free. Lyra: Niko! We're slipping! - [screaming] - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - [trilling] - [grunting] I have you! - [grunting] - [screaming] I think it's the other way around. - [screaming] - [grunting] [gibberish] If you are complimenting me on a most excellent battle, I say thank you, humble sidekick. I could not have done it without you. Actually, he says we're sinking. [gibberish] Lyra: You can skip the translation. I know this in any language. We're in slicksand! All: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! ♪♪ Chirp.
