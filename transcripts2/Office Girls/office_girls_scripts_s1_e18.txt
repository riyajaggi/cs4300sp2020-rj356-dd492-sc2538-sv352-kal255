 Xing Ren, you have to pay Mr. Chen a visit later. He's the one who made a complaint about the Food Court last week. I do remember, Mr. Shi. I've prepared a gift box. I'll head over soon. Very good, remember to take your assistant with you. What? I'm giving you a good opportunity. You better go and learn from it. Mr. Shi. In half an hour, the shop owner will take the Halloween decorations to the warehouse. Do you want to go take a look?

 All right. Hold the elevator. Mr. Shi. You're taking the elevator too? What do you think? Why me? Why do I run into you all the time? What did you say? Nothing. I thought you were talking to me. What's going on? Maybe the elevator malfunctioned? Why do bad things happen to me every time I see you? I'm afraid of the dark! - Don't be. - What are you doing?

 Well, I have a new toy. It's a mini projector. You can watch videos. Let me turn it on. You won't be scared anymore. Here. You see? Don't complain about me so much. I'm still useful sometimes. I guess. Now we can take our time and enjoy the video. While we wait patiently to be rescued. Enjoy this beautiful, romantic moment. I'll let you lean on my shoulder. If you want to cry, go ahead and cry. Even if you don't want to cry, you can still lean on my shoulder. Why would I want to cry? Fine. If you're still nervous, we can do breathing exercises together. Do it with me. Come on. Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe out. Mr. Shi! Have you no decency? Farting in the elevator is the equivalent of murder. Stay away from me. Poor me. You can come out now. Are you all right, Lele? I'm fine, aside from almost dying from your poisonous gas. Listen, you're terrible at apologies. Just watch me and do as I do. Fine. What are you doing? Qin Zi Qi, this is the pre-sale apartment that I booked. The construction is almost done. If I hadn't smashed those bottles of wine, me and my mom would be getting ready to move into that place now. I think my mom would really like it here. What a shame. Trust me, one day, I will buy you the place you've always wanted. Forget it. You can hardly support yourself. It's better to only count on myself. I will keep my promise. You just have to remember I said that. All right, it's almost time. Let's go. I'm not done folding the laundry yet. I'll take it downstairs for you later. This is for you. What are you up to. This is weird. It can't be good. Just open it. This can be modified. If you want a bigger yard, or if you don't like a window, or the layout, I can modify any of that. You said you were working on a craft project. Is this it? Yes. I know I don't have any money now. I also know I don't have the power to change anything. But even now, there's still something that can be done. I think you should have a concrete form of your Dream House. At least it's a start. At least, now you have this. You won't be disappointed anymore. Trust me, one day, I will buy you the place you've always wanted. I will keep my promise. You just have to remember I said that. I have a friend who happens to be the heir of a development company. If you want to buy a home, I can get him to give you a better price. I'm terrified that four years of hard work will vanish into thin air. From now on, we'll shoulder it together. The 22,500 you had to pay back, I'll let you make it back. This is for you. Seven and a half grand? Where's your watch? You sold your watch. I promise you I will eat broccoli. I will learn to ride a moped and take you to work. I told you I'd go get a driver's license. I did as I promised. When you fall for someone, can you really turn your feelings for them on or off? Why not? It's just being in love, right? Isn't it better to be up-front about it? Right, but when someone finds you annoying, it's hard to be up-front about it, okay? You can start thinking about what your Dream House will look like. Then... you can bring this to me and exchange it for a real house. Mrs. Shen can live there, too. Dream House is sturdy and it won't leak. You won't have to worry about typhoons anymore. You don't like it? I don't know. If there's anything you don't like, I can change it for you. Just like me. I didn't eat broccoli, but now I do. I wanted to resign after the first day. But I'm still doing my job. I spent 1,500 bucks a night. Now I can go through a month on 150 alone. So-- What? So, I think I probably-- Shen Xing Ren. I think perhaps I-- Shen Xing Ren, if nothing unexpected happens, maybe I-- Do you get it? I've already said so much. I don't get it. Why? I practically spelled it out for you. I just don't get it. You can explain it to me. I don't want to. Why are you getting mad? You don't get it? Or are you pretending? Qin Zi Qi, why aren't you sleeping? What do you-- If possible, I hope you won't have any more contact with him, aside from your work. Is that all right? I really don't get it. I don't understand why you would build this doll house for me. I also don't understand why you would say those things you just said. I just want to let you know, even though your looks are ordinary, and your figure is ordinary, to me, you're very special. So I think, maybe we could-- Hello? Xing Ren, this is your mother. I'm downstairs. Come get the door for me. My mom's downstairs. I have to get the door. Time to eat. Come on. When was the last time you ate? Why are you wolfing it down like that? Zi Qi, you seem even skinnier than last time. It pains me to see you like this. That's right. Shen Xing Ren wouldn't let me board with her. That's why your Zi Qi was always hungry. Shen Xing Ren, why are you so stingy? Our Zi Qi is already so skinny. You should make delicious food for him more often. Mom, how come you just showed up here? Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I meant to do that on purpose. That way, I can check up on you without you knowing in advance. I want to see if you're being nice to our Zi Qi. By the looks of it, you seem to be doing pretty good. - Not really. - Right. Zi Qi, have you been taking good care of my Xing Ren for me? Mrs. Shen, I'm giving it my all. That's good, then. Mrs. Shen, don't you worry, I'll definitely be responsible. What are you talking about? I knew I made the right choice. Xing Ren, Zi Qi is a good man. He's responsible, adorable, and handsome. I like him. Very much. What do you want? This one? Sure. Have some more. Thanks, Mrs. Shen. So cute. I'm stuffed, Mrs. Shen. Thank you. Don't mention it. Just come up here whenever you're hungry. Sure. Think of this place as your home. Come visit often. Sure. Mrs. Shen, I should get going now. Sure. Hold on. Mom, what are you doing? I want to take a look at Zi Qi's place. We already know each other so well. His place is just downstairs. And I've already come here. It seems a bit strange if I don't visit his place. Are you all right? Are you hurt? I'm fine. Mom, now you've seen his place. We can go. We can't do that. We have to sit for a bit. Have a seat, Mrs. Shen. I see, this is my Zi Qi's place. Sorry, Mrs. Shen. I haven't cleaned in, like, forever. Silly boy, don't be sorry. I should say sorry to you. Shen Xing Ren, it's not that I like to nag you. But this is your responsibility. Why don't you come down here and clean this place for Zi Qi when you have time? Why should I clean for him? I work too. I'm always dead tired after work. My Zi Qi isn't a stranger. You're going to be family soon. You're going to have to clean his place eventually. Why not do it now and start getting the hang of it? Don't you agree with me? Yes. Mom, what's the matter with you? Why do you keep siding with him? I'm your daughter. A daughter married off becomes someone else's daughter. My Zi Qi is half a son. Just kidding. I can't play favorites with you two. I love you equally. I'm not playing favorites. Don't be jealous. You're totally playing favorites. I'll get the door. Why are you here? You have a visitor? Can I come in? Hi, I'm a friend of Zi Qi. This is Mrs. Shen. This is Zheng Kai Er, the assistant manager in Leasing Department. How do you do, Mrs. Shen? Hello. Your assistant manager is so pretty. You're almost out of toilet paper. I just got you some. I also got you a microwave. When you're hungry, you won't have to trouble her anymore. Thanks for all your help, Xing Ren. Don't mention it. Now that he has a microwave. It'll be more convenient for him. Qin Zi Qi won't have to come upstairs and trouble us anymore. Your assistant manager is so nice. She came all the way to deliver toilet paper and a microwave for you. Mom, don't pry. Come on, let's go. Zi Qi, we should head back, since you have a guest here. What is it? Nothing. I'll put the stuff away. Mom, do you want to take a shower now? That assistant manager is very nice. She's so good to the employees. It's so late and she still bought a bunch of stuff for Zi Qi. She even carried a heavy microwave all the way up. What's the nature of their relationship? How should I know? It's none of my business. If you don't want to take a shower I'll go. - Mrs. Shen! - Lele! It's been a long time! What brings you here? It has been a long time since you came to visit me with Xing Ren. I'll definitely go next time. Mrs. Shen, you're still looking so young and pretty. Thanks. Lele, I have a question to ask you. What is it? Has anything happened between my Zi Qi and Xing Ren recently? You mean Qin Zi Qi? I thought they've been acting weird too. Well, what about that pretty assistant manager? You mean Ms. Zheng? That's right. You've met her? She came to see Zi Qi just now, and bought a bunch of things. What's the nature of their relationship? She's Qin Zi Qi's girlfriend. What's wrong, Mrs. Shen? My Xing Ren is going to get dumped. Don't cry, Mrs. Shen. Mrs. Shen! What's wrong? You seem unhappy to see me. No. I think we should just drink water. Let me get you some water. Can I lean on you? Just for a while. What's wrong? Are you feeling sad? Can I ask you a question? Am I unattractive? No. You're very attractive. But I don't have much self-confidence. I also think I'm terrible. I can't find anything good about myself. Can I ask you something? When you went upstairs that night, was it really just for stomach medicine? I know what I did was wrong. I knew it would upset you. But I care about you a lot. I'm jealous of Shen Xing Ren. I wanted to let her know, you're special to me. There's something I should let you know. You're really a great girl. You deserve better. I just want to let you know, I'm in love with Shen Xing Ren. What do you see in Xing Ren that I don't have? It's not about that at all. Xing Ren isn't as smart or as beautiful as you. Nor is she as decisive, efficient, or as strong as you. I don't really know why I-- Don't be mistaken. I'm not comparing you to her. I-- I know. I totally understand. Maybe we should-- Don't worry. We can be friends forever. Instead of being lovers, we can be friends for life. Isn't that better? To our friendship. Starting tomorrow, let's forget all the unpleasant things. All right? Good friend. I should head back. Be careful. Goodnight. Goodnight. Qin Zi Qi. Are you pre-occupied with something else? You keep looking at your watch. It's not me, it's Shen Xing Ren, she-- Are you kidding me? You'd charge me for food waste? You don't have to eat it, if you don't want to. Wait. Give it to me. Just eat up. What happened to your hand? There was a blow fuse at Xing Ren's place. I went to check her panel box and I accidentally got electrocuted. Shen Xing Ren, I'm hurt. Dress my wound for me. I'm in love with Shen Xing Ren. So you never fell in love with me. But I fell in love with you, Zi Qi. Come out here. I want to talk to you. Is it Zi Qi? No. Qin Zi Qi! BEAUTIFUL ASSISTANT MANAGER- ZHENG KAI ER I put on your shirt and went upstairs to give Xing Ren the wrong idea, because I really care about you. If I caused any trouble for you, I'm really sorry. I hope this won't affect our friendship. I'm sorry.
