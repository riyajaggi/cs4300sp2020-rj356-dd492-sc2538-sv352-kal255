 Hello! Qin Zi Qi, what are you doing? Just because Xin Ren isn't around, doesn't mean you can harrass me. Nobody wants to harrass you. Why have you turned yourself into Medusa? Are you going cray-cray? None of your stinking business. What do you want? I have an important thing to ask you. What? Where's Sheng Xin Ren's hometown? Give me the address. Why do you want the address? What do you think? I'm going to see her.

 What for? Why do you care? You don't want me all up in your business. Then stay out of mine. Qin Zi Qi, you're asking me for her address. Please stay away from her, all right? Don't you think she's been down on her luck ever since she met you? She's lost her job and four years' worth of savings. Please stay away from her, all right? I'm going to see her, precisely because I feel bad. Why? Because I broke one of the bottles. I can't let her take all the blame. I at least have to pay for the one bottle I broke. Where will you get the money?

 Don't worry about that. I'll figure something out. Yeah, right. Please. I beg you. I can give you some sacrificial offerings. It's the one at the very end. Thanks. Sheng Xin Ren. Sheng Xin Ren. Sheng Xin Ren. What a dorky hairdo. "Perfect attendance during all three years at school. Kept perfect attendance record for all three years at school. Sheng Xin Ren kept perfect attendance record for all four years at school. Sheng Xin Ren had perfect attendance for all six years at school." Why don't you change your name to "Sheng Perfect Attendance"? Your resilience is amazing. Don't you ever get sick? Bitter melon can cook with fermented soybean. And carrots can... Qin Zi Qi. - Hi. - What the heck? What are you doing here? I'm here to see you, of course. Who is this? Mom, he's a colleague of mine. Mrs. Sheng, how do you do? My name is Qin Zi Qi. Hi. Hi. He's handsome. - Is the fan blowing in your direction? - Yes. Good. Thanks. Here you go. How do you know where I live? I kept pestering Lele until she finally gave me your address. What are you doing here? Why do you think? It's for the red-- Red... Red rice. - Red rice? - Yes. The bottle of red rice pickled veggies Sheng Xin Ren brought back was so good, I finished it already and decided to buy it from you. You don't need to do that. If you like it, just call my daughter. She can bring it back for you. Or I can send it to you, too. Our place is a long way from Taipei. You didn't have to travel this far. Mrs. Sheng, it takes too long to send it by mail. It's faster for me to come here. Mr. Qin, do you really like my pickled veggies that much? Yes. Your pickled veggies are delicious. Can I call you the female version of Jamie Oliver? Qin Zi Qi, now you're just brown-nosing. Mr. Qin, if you like my pickled veggies so much, I'll pack more for you later. You can take them back and enjoy them. Sure. Mrs. Sheng, you can call me Jason or Zi Qi. Don't call me Mr. Qin. Mr. Qin, why are you kissing up to my mom? - I'm not. - Yes, you are. I'll go make food. You stay for dinner. Sure. Mom, um... He's not hungry. Not true. I'm very hungry. He came all this way to our home. We have to ask him to stay for dinner. You're rude. You're rude. Come with me. Qin Zi Qi, tell me honestly, what are you doing here? It can't be just about pickled veggies. Of course it's not. All right, I don't care what you do. But I'm giving you a severe warning. You cannot let my mom know about me breaking those bottles of wine and quitting my job. You hear me? Fine. I'm not that dumb. This is for you. What is it? $7,400 PAYABLE TO SHENG XIN REN Seven thousand, four hundred? What's this for? I'm paying back the bottle I broke. Qin Zi Qi, you're as poor as a church mouse. Where did you get all this money? What do you care? Just take it. You won the lottery? If I won the lottery, I'd never be this stingy. I'd buy the whole winery, I tell you. You borrowed from loan sharks? If I did, would I board with you? And eat food waste every day? You got yourself a sugar mama? Seriously? You really did? - How did you know? - Who is it? No way! Not with my family background! What background? Even though we're not very rich, at least we have integrity. I could never do that. If you don't tell me where you got the money, I can't accept it. Just take it. Where's your watch? I forgot it to wear it. You sold your watch. Qin Zi Qi, even when you were so poor, you didn't have money to eat, you still didn't sell your watch. Why are you doing this now? Whatever I am, I'm still a man. I won't let you pay for the bottle I broke. Your mom doesn't know you quit? Keep it down. Why won't you tell her? I don't want her to worry about me. If she found out I'm unemployed and I have to pay back so much money, she'd be super worried. Don't you forget, if you tell one lie, you have to tell even more lies to cover up the first lie, you know? Can you tell so many lies? OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT Sheng Xin Ren, are you done writing this month's joint promotional advertisement for food court? Sheng Xin Ren? Mr. Shi, Sheng Xin Ren already handed in her resignation. I've taken over writing the promotional piece. Is that right? Well, now it's your task. Are you done? Not yet. Not yet? What are you doing slacking off? How long are you going to keep me waiting? Until next year? Who made this document's font so small? I'll go blind after reading this. Sheng Xin Ren, go enlarge the font on this document, and translate it into Mandarin for me. Sheng Xin-- Mr. Shi, Sheng Xin Ren already quit. Let me do that for you. Am I the manager or you? I fired her. You think I don't know she's gone? You think I need you to tell me the obvious? Forget it. Mr. Shi, you seem to be having a hard time getting used to Sheng Xin Ren's absence. I don't know whether or not I'm having a hard time getting used to her absence. But if one day, you're no longer around the office, I think I'll get used to it very quickly. Why are you still standing here? You two useless pieces of garbage, don't you know this is a critical moment of survival for Operations? We're already short one person. You two are still slacking off every day. Go make the rounds. Yes, right away. Why are you still here? I'm still working on the promotional piece. I don't care. Do it outside. I don't want to see your face right now. RESIGNATION LETTER Sheng Xin Ren, interim team leader of Operations Department, her dereliction of duty nearly caused great damage to the company's image. After careful consideration and much thought, I've decided... to give her another chance. Mr. Shi, this document must be signed by tomorrow. Thanks. Give this to HR's Ms. Fon for me. What's this? This isn't a game of 20 questions. Just deliver it, as you're told. Grumpy much? Are you menopausing? Again? Lele. Ms. Zheng. How come I haven't seen Qin Zi Qi at the office today? Did something happen to him? Qin Zi Qi? He asked for the day off today. Asked for the day off? He went to see Xin Ren. He came to our home early this morning, asking me where Xin Ren's mom lives. He's really annoying. Anyway, I have to deliver documents. Bye, Ms. Zheng. Here you go. Thanks, Ms. Zheng. I'VE DECIDED TO GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE Mr. Qin, my mom was just being polite. You're really making yourself at home? Your house is really comfortable. All right, as long as you're comfortable. Listen, I'm going to get some coriander from the garden. Keep your mouth shut. Don't say anything you shouldn't. Fine. Dinner will be ready soon. Mrs. Sheng, let me help you. - You know how to do this? - No. Here, let me show you. You just pull away the fiber, like so. We'll wash and stir-fry them later. Like this? No, here. The fibers. We don't want to eat the fibers. Don't toss it in the bowl. Just put it on the side. My apologies, our place is so small. Please don't mind the shabby accommodations. Not at all. I think your place is very warm, very comfortable. Really? You're so sweet. No, Mrs. Sheng. I'm not just being polite. I think whether a house is warm has nothing to do with its size. It's not like the bigger the house is, it's the happier the people are inside. Of course. A house is not the same as a home. A house is just a cold structure made out of concrete and steel. A home is different. You have family members inside. It's the people who make the home. By the way, how many people do you have in your family? Just me and my dad. What about your mother? Divorced. I'm so sorry. That's all right. It happened when I was real young. They were always busy when I was a kid. Busy working, going on business trips. Busy with their career and everything. They just never had time for me. We couldn't even sit down and have a decent conversation. Don't think of it like that. I'm sure, even though they're busy, they still think of you all the time. Maybe. Mrs. Sheng, I'm quite envious to see how you and your daughter are so close. Actually, I'm quite envious of you, too, seeing how you and Xin Ren are so close. But that's how things go. A girl all grown up is destined to leave home. I'm going to have to rely on you, to take care of my Xin Ren in the future. Mom, what are you talking about? Who's going to take care of whom? Don't be shy. That's just the way it is. You're not like a celebrity or anything. Why are you afraid of letting people know? Being in love is natural. It's okay to admit it. It's not true. How can I admit it? I don't have much education, but I'm not blind. Nobody would come all this way just for a bottle of pickled veggies. I'm here because-- Fine, if you don't want to admit it, then I won't talk about it. I'm really open-minded, you know. It's only normal for young people to have friends. Zi Qi, you haven't told me what your parents do. Mom, I thought you wanted to make soup? I got the coriander. No, Zi Qi was just about to tell me-- Why don't you go make soup, all right? Go, I'm hungry. Go make soup. Here's the coriander. RESIGNATION - Xiao Qiao? - Yes? Take this to HR for me. Yes, Ms. Zheng. Ms. Zheng. I just went to confirm Wei Deng's mid-year sale events. They told me they already passed the information to Xiao Qiao. So? I'm in charge of Wei Deng. Not anymore. Food Court restaurant's leasing agreement has ended and won't re-new the contract. Go find new restaurateurs. Why? Because I'm the assistant manager. And I think you're incapable of the job. - Eat up, Mr. Qin. - Thanks. You're so skinny. You should eat more. I didn't have time to get better ingredients today. You should come back more often. I'll make you better food next time. Seriously? Of course. Qin Zi Qin, are you for real? You really would trouble my mother? Mrs. Sheng said so herself. Would it trouble you? So thick-skinned. Xin Ren, you should pay more attention to Mr. Qin's finer qualities. Don't be fooled by his nonchalant exterior. I know how to read people. I know he's a very warm, very considerate boy on the inside. Considerate? I haven't found any finer qualities in him since I've come to know him. Everyone has finer qualities. Don't belittle yourself. But my dad doesn't see any good in me. Maybe he hasn't discovered it. Not yet discovered doesn't mean it's not there. Not yet discovered doesn't mean it's not there. After all this talk, you haven't told me what your parents do. You must never reveal your identity at the company. Our family works in the food and grocery retail industry. What do you sell? A lot of things. So your parents own a corner store? A slightly bigger corner store. Mom, why are you prying into his family business? Are you doing a background check? I'm just asking. It's nothing serious. Are you worried he might feel uneasy? What? Why would I worry what he thinks? He's not anyone to me. You're my daughter, I can tell. You work together, and you live together. - Upstairs and downstairs. - Upstairs and downstairs Who wants to live with him? What kind of attitude is that? At least I come from a nice family with a simple background. I've even got an MBA degree. Really? That's incredible. You don't look very tall. The hoop is so tall, how do you get the ball in there? I didn't know you were so good at basketball. Mrs. Sheng, I mean MBA. Master's degree in business management. That means you're really good in school? My Xin Ren isn't quite like that. She was not very good in school. All she ever got were perfect attendance awards. Hey, perfect attendance awards are hard to get, too. It's one thing to be good at school, another to be good at work. Good at work also doesn't mean you have good people skills. So good at school doesn't mean you're a good person. But I think Mr. Qin is very polite and considerate. Most importantly, he's so handsome. Handsome? He can even "smize." Mrs. Sheng, what you just said is very unbiased. You have good taste. I admire you. Qin Zi Qi, stop polluting my mom's pure and beautiful mind, all right? I didn't do that. I almost forgot... You two take your time. I have to tend to the kitchen. Please enjoy. Ms. Fon, are you done signing the documents today? I'll let you know when I'm done. OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT Ms. Fon, you want some coffee? I can make some for you. No, I'd still like to sleep tonight. Thanks. Lele, why don't you return to your seat? You're making me nervous. I'll let you know when I'm done. Okay? Ms. Fon, let you rub your shoulders. You seem really tired. No, thanks. What about a massage? Would you like that? Lele, if you don't leave now, there's going to be a massacre instead of a massage. Sheng Xin Ren. Such a good employee. WILL NOT GIVE HER A SECOND CHANCE Xin Ren, hurry up. Mrs. Sheng, let me help you. That's all right. You don't know where the leaks are. You'll get all wet from the rain. Xin Ren, go get the mop and mop the floor. Zi Qi, this is probably the first time you've seen a house that leaks. Mrs. Sheng, it's pouring down. Don't you mind the noise? Not at all, just think of it as a concert. I've heard it for two to three decades. If I didn't hear it, I'd feel really weird. Mrs. Sheng, you're so optimistic. Sheng Xin Ren's probably gets her positive attitude from you. My daughter is a lot like me. Whether you're happy or sad, you still have to live through the day. So it's better to live in a way that makes you happier. Typhoon Tara made landfall in Taitung and will head for Northern Taiwan. Maximum wind speed will reach force ten. Estimated rainfall could reach 2 inches. Residents along the coastline must be ready for extreme heavy rain. The typhoon has already made landfall? I thought it wasn't going to affect Northern Taiwan until tomorrow night? That's right. That means this typhoon is moving very fast. How am I supposed to get back with this kind of rain? Are you saying, you're not going to leave? I want to leave, but how can I leave in this weather? No, if you make him leave now, what if he gets blown away by the typhoon? That's right. Mom! The hole is huge! Mrs. Sheng, let me go up and check it out. No. Mom, I'll go with him. Give him a raincoat. Okay. That's a huge hole! Be careful! What are you doing? Don't come up here. I'm going to help you. How will you manage on your own? Xin Ren, you guys be careful. Okay, we will. Go back inside. Be careful. Watch out. Hold this side down. There's a brick. Hold down that side. I finally understand why you want to buy a place of your own. Now you know? Ever since I was a kid, I've watched my mother work so hard to give me a roof over my head. I always wished I could do more. Finally, now that I'm grown and have the ability to do so, of course I want to buy a place for her to live comfortably. But now I've smashed the wine. I've lost the Dream House Fund. I will cancel the pre-sale apartment. Please relay my apologies to your friend. I'm sorry. It's because of me, you couldn't get the house you wanted. Why apologize? It's not your fault. It was me who smashed the wine bottles. It's my responsibility to pay it back. I managed to save up the first 30 thousand bucks of my life, That means I can save up to 60 and 90 thousand. Don't worry. I can definitely make it back. What are you looking at? Nothing. I believe you can too. Be careful, you. You be careful. I will. Qin Zi Qi! Are you all right? I only twisted my arm. I didn't break it. Why do you have to wrap it? It's so ugly. Not trendy at all. You're hurt. Who cares if it's trendy? I'm kind enough to dress your wound. What matters is taking care of the wound. Keep your opinions to yourself. What? I only got hurt because of you. Zi Qi. Zi Qi, come on. You got rained on and soaked through. Drink some ginger soup, so you won't catch a cold. Thank you, Mrs. Sheng. Poor thing, you're soaked through. Xin Ren, what are you doing with that gauze? What? I'm dressing his wound. Must you make it look like he's got a weird tumor growing out of his arm? Fine, I'll redo it. The weather is crazy outside. Zi Qi is hurt, too. Why don't you spend the night at our place? You can return tomorrow when the rain and wind die down a little. Sure. This towel is for you. Let me go get your bedding ready. Did you hear that? The weather is crazy outside. Go back tomorrow. Mrs. Sheng. What are you trying to do now? I'm redoing it. Don't mess with me. Apologize. Sorry. JING SHI DEPARTMENT STORE You want another day off? I think you just automatically gave yourself a day off because of the typhoon. Qin Zi Qi, you're too talented. I think it's a waste of your talent, staying in the Operations Department. You should really be working in the Human Resources Department. Two days off in a row? You're really living the life, aren't you? Mr. Shi, on my way to work yesterday, a dog jumped out in the middle of the road. He started chasing me. He kept chasing me. Then I rode my moped faster and faster until my moped fell over. So then I went to the hospital. Then they put me on an IV drips. After that, I thought, "Now I'm fine." So I went home. But I started to develop a fever after I went home. I kept thinking, that's not right. So I checked my wound. This really isn't as simple as it sounds. When I saw the wound, I realized, I did get bitten by the dog. So then I thought, what if I got rabies? If I showed up at the office the next day and gave the other colleagues rabies, it would be the most immoral behavior. So I secretly shed my tears and went back to the hospital for another checkup. Then they put me on an IV drip again. Half way through the IV drips, I started developing a fever, my temperature reached 104 degree. I almost passed out just now. I'm now using the last bit of my energy calling you to ask for the day off. I really didn't mean for any of this to happen. I don't care if you meant it or not. Don't you know that asking for a day off is troubling your colleagues? Don't they have to do your work for you? Mr. Shi, you heard it yourself. This is all an accident. A most unexpected accident. Please let me take the day off, all right? Fine. Knowing you, even if I said no, you still wouldn't show up. Anyway, just make sure you punch in on time tomorrow. Yes, thank you, Mr. Shi.
