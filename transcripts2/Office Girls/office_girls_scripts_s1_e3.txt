 I can't believe he threw you under the bus in front of Shi Te Long. Want me to talk trash about him in front of Deputy GM Fon? That's not necessary. Annoying as he is, Shi Te Long won't go easy on him. - Qin Zi Qi? - What's he doing here? Qin Zi Qi, what are you doing here? This is Sheng Xin Ren's package. Instead of working hard at your day job, you're also a part-time delivery man? What are you talking about? I live downstairs. You live downstairs? You're the "One No and Three Withouts" guy.

 You're the pianist with severe bipolar disorder. It's called talent. I signed for your package for you. It's 14,800. Hold on, let me get it. Wait. Let's check it out, in case he switched it on us. - I see, top-floor apartment is like this. - What are you doing? Don't come in. The rooftop is common space. I live downstairs. Why can't I go in? We rent out the top floor, which includes the rooftop space. - What? - Let me see. Qin Zi Qi, what's all this? What? How come it's a bunch of empty bottles? These are not mine.

 The group purchase order I made is for cosmetics. That's right. Where's our stuff? This is the package. It's even got your name on the delivery ticket. - No way! - No way! Give me my money, I'm leaving. Well? Did you find the seller? We're doomed. I think they closed the account. Call them. I just did. It's no longer in service. It can't be! We got scammed? I'm never this lucky when I buy lottery tickets. I think it's true. What should we do? What should we do? You spent money on a bunch of bottles. What's that got to do with me? You should pay me back. It's a bunch of empty bottles. Why should I pay you? Are you a con artist? I only signed for it on your behalf. How should I know what's inside? - I didn't ask you to sign for me. - I was being kind and helpful. You don't praise me for being kind and dependable, how dare you call me a con artist? What? You won't pay up? - What are you doing? - Video evidence in case you lie about it. Xin Ren, you go ahead. Qin Zi Qi, it's not that I won't pay you back. I'm buying this on behalf of a group of people. If I give you the money, what will I tell those people? That's your concern. You should have checked the content first. How should I know? I don't shop online. Even if you didn't know, you can't ask us to be responsible for it. If I were you, I would have checked. I only signed for it on your behalf. I never asked you to do that. I already paid for it. Please pay me back, all right? Not my money to give you. I ordered it for a group. - What are you saying? - Enough, already. I don't have money, but I can call the anti-fraud and scam hotline for you. So you won't pay me back? It's just a bunch of empty bottles. Why should we pay you? Fine, it's just my luck. Thankfully I checked the contents, otherwise we'd lose a bunch of money. But we can't really blame it all on him. He's kind of out of luck, too. It's not your fault. Unless you want to give him 14,800? That will be 56 total. - I did the math. It should be 47 bucks. - 47? It says on the rice ball package. The second one is 50 percent off. That's only if you use the store card. What store card? I... - Then I don't want the second one. - That's fine. That will be 36 bucks. Thirty... Five... Six. Thank you. Hello, Paul. Can you lend me some money? I'm sorry, I can't. You can ask Michael. Don't tell me whom to go to. Why don't you lend me money? I would, if I could. You know I work for my family business. I only get a monthly wage from my father. That kind of money isn't enough at all. You... Don't you have a Black Card? That belongs to my mother. I'm really sorry. Never mind. I'll figure something out. Will you lend me some money? I'll pay you back when I get paid next month. I'll get paid soon. JING SHI DEPARTMENT STORE You're something else. It's only been a few days, and you've already spent a whole month's pay. Didn't I tell you? Company issuing an advance to an employee, you're the first one and the last one. I'm also a victim here. Auntie... I know you're a person of principle. I am too. So I can only come to you for help. Please lend me some money. I've only got 14 bucks left. I can't believe you'd even say that out loud. You don't want to watch me starve to death, do you? - Is it that serious? - It is. - You're really going to starve to death? - Yes. I've got it. Here. - Here you go. - What's this? Coupons for the food court. You won't starve to death that quick. That's too much trouble. Why can't you just lend me money? If I could be your human ATM, I wouldn't have promised your father I'd help him with this, right? Auntie... Will you help me or not? Yes, I'll help you... - Really? - Help you call Mr. Chairman. You can talk to him. If he's fine with it, then I'll do it. No, thanks. I don't think he'll speak to a "vegetable" anyway. I'll figure something out. You... Jason. You... Qin Zi Qi? What's he doing playing basketball instead of eating? It's lunch time. Is he still a teenager or something? He's weird. Lele, I think he's really broke. I saw him buying stuff at the convenience store last night. He didn't even have enough money. I gave him a ride to work this morning. Stop, Sheng Xin Ren. Don't waste your empathy on someone like him, okay? Come on, let's go. I'm starving. Let's go eat. Come on. You spent money on a bunch of bottles. What's that got to do with me? I only signed for it on your behalf. How should I know what's inside? I didn't ask you to sign for me. I was being kind and helpful. You don't praise me for being kind and dependable, how dare you call me a con artist? What? You won't pay up? Qin Zi Qi. Qin Zi Qi. Drop the act. You only skipped one meal. You won't die. Can you please pay me back? I told you, it's not my money. Don't you understand? If I really died of hunger, it'd be your fault. Well... we're colleagues, after all. You're not the only one who's kind and dependable. If you really don't have money for food, you can come board with me. Seriously? Of course, it's not for free. I can let you keep it on the tab. You can pay me back when you get paid. How's that "kind and dependable"? Fine, let me see the menu. Do you have truffle, caviar, Matsusaka beef? The offer won't stand forever. Dinner time. What is this? What? You don't know what pickled cucumber is? Pickled cucumber with pasta? What kind of cuisine is this? Are you dumb or what? Xin Ren's mother makes the best pickled veggies. I'll trade with you. No way, no how. Xin Ren is kind enough to let the refugee keep a tab and pay her back. You should be content. How dare you complain? Dinner, 50 bucks. Sign here. This animal feed costs 50 bucks? What animal feed? Wait, I don't eat this. How old are you again? Still won't eat your greens? - How immature. - Who are you calling immature? - You. - You. I pay to board with you. Do you think you're feeding a pig? How dare you say that? I worked hard to make this meal. I'm eating the same food. Sheng Xin Ren, just because you work hard doesn't mean other people will accept it. I don't eat broccoli is an unchangeable fact, just like Yu Cheng Feng would never open a shop at a department store. Don't compare you being a picky eater with Master Yu's principle. Plus, I believe as long as I work harder, I will still succeed. That won't mean anything. He's a businessman. It's faster to show him the profit estimates. You think money can solve everything? You think working hard can solve everything? What if we're really sincere and work real hard to show him the profit estimates? Never mind. What will move Yu Cheng Feng? He's rich enough, so money won't work. So we must have sincerity. Sincerity is too abstract. Well... why don't we wait for him every day by his house? Can't you show a little creativity? We should target his personality. You're that guy's biggest fan. You should know what he's like. Famous designer, handsome, talented, and he never tries to pull strings to get into an establishment. - I didn't pull any strings. - I didn't say it was you. - Then why did you look at me? - I was talking to you. - You were totally talking about me. - I was not. - You swear? - Yes. Who is this man? He's so cute. - Yu Cheng Feng. - Yu Cheng Feng. Of course, I know who he is. I mean the one next to him. Listen to me. In order to avoid confrontation, you just sit here quietly later. Do not say a word. Why? Because I'm telling you to do so. You stay here. Lele and I... Eat your lollipop. - Hi, Michael. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. We've met before. - I'm from Jing Shi Department Store... - I know, you're the fan lady. - My name is Sheng Xin Ren. - I am Lele. The thing is, I'd like to give Master Yu this business proposal. I wonder if he's in right now? Mr. Yu isn't here. You can go back now. Excuse me, are you a designer? I'm Mr. Yu's assistant. You're so handsome and so well-dressed. You'll surely be a star designer someday. Please, let us see Master Yu. I'll tell you what, you can leave your proposal here. I'll give it to Mr. Yu, all right? If possible, I'd like to give it to him in person. Please, come on. Or let us wait for him in there, all right? Come on, pretty please? Excuse me. Hello? Mr. Yu. Yes. Where? Yes. Sure, all right. I got it, Mr. Yu. No problem. I'll contact them right away. Thank you, Mr. Yu. Bye-bye. Mr. Yu won't come in today. It's no use for you to wait here. Why don't you come back another time? You're more than welcome, as long as it's not work-related. He's not giving you the time of day. Why don't you get going? Bye-bye. This is my phone number. Now you know how good I am? I didn't know eyebrow pencil could be used like this. That's not the point. Who was that handsome stud? Do you know him? His name is Michael. He's drop dead gorgeous. He will surely become a famous designer in the future. It's possible, you never know. Should I buy something he designed, take a photo and post it online? When he becomes a big shot, everyone will think I've got foresight. None of that is important. You're running out of time. Do you want to find him or not? I'm not in charge of finding him, only here for the eye candy. I'm going to work now, bye. Qin Zi Qi, you head on over. I've got to go home and grab something. I'll meet you there. Hey! Would it kill you to praise me a little? Hello? Please hurry up, all right? Wait for me a while longer, I'll be right there. Your idol is about to leave. Hurry up. I don't care, you figure something out and hold him there for me. - That's all. Bye. - Hello? I didn't know Master Yu was into this. Want to play and see who wins? Sorry, not interested. You don't want to play or are you too chicken? Just like you're too chicken to start a shop at Jing Shi. You're afraid of competition from other businesses. I don't like meaningless competition. Plus, confidence is not something you need to compete to show. I hear your financial backer is Wei Min Na's father. You're afraid to start a shop, because you're the boss in name only. You don't have any real say, do you? Looks like you did some homework in your effort of trying to persuade me. Master Yu, do you remember this dress? In my high school senior year, all of my classmates agreed, we would wear our prettiest dress to the graduation dance party. But I didn't have anything to wear. My mom only gave me 500 bucks to buy something. Then I saw a really pretty dress at a shop. Do you like it? You can try it on. That's all right. I'm just looking. The truth is, I don't have enough money. This dress is my design. If you really like it, I can give you a discount. Really? But I only have 500 bucks. That's all right. Let's try it on. This dress looks really good on you. I thought you were lying to me. I thought something so amazing would never happen to me. This dress really does look great on you. If I hadn't run into you, I probably would've had to wear my uniform to the dance party. Your designs are really beautiful, but I can't afford them. I couldn't afford it then, I can't afford it even more so now. If you're willing to open a shop I will design an open space, to allow more people to see your designs. So more people like me, who can't afford your designs, will have an opportunity to see your work. Master Yu, I put in a lot of effort and I re-did the business proposal. I have outlined all the details inside. I know you're really hard-working. Unfortunately, I'm not God. I cannot fulfill everyone's dream. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. What did Yu Cheng Feng say? You think you can get away with this just by stonewalling me? I told you, if you can't handle this Yu Cheng Feng business, you can just pack up and leave. Mr. Shi, it really isn't our problem. It's Yu Cheng Feng's personality. Sheng Xin Ren did everything short of kneeling in front of him, yet he was still unmoved. He's definitely cold-blooded. Excuse me, did I hear this right? Are you defending her now? When did you two become such good buddies? Why don't you go to the city hall and get married already? Of course, as your manager, I'm not all tough love and no loving encouragement. If you can get Yu Cheng Feng, I'll promote you to Team Leader. Is that clear? It's up to you two, whether you want to tie yourselves together and jump off a building or ascend to heaven holding hands. Waste of my time. If Yu Cheng Feng is willing to open a shop here, I have to chance to become Team Leader. What good is becoming a Team Leader? At least I can get a raise. Then I'll get even closer to realizing my dream of buying my mom a place. I have to climb up, one step at a time. Climb? Where do you want to climb to? Sheng Xin Ren, you've been climbing for four years, and still a floor manager. Even if you make Team Leader, a bunch of supervisors will make your life hell. That's the way it goes in retail business. Accumulate your seniority and work hard. What else can you do? Then why did Zheng Kai Er get to be assistant manager at such a young age? She's beautiful, young, capable, brings in great business, and she knows a lot of the right people. Are you satisfied with the answer? At least you're honest. Here's your lunch. Do you really think I'm a pig? This is leftovers from last night. What leftovers? This is freshly made, from this morning. "Freshly made"? This is my bite mark. You can tell it's yours? Only this one isn't fresh. Lunch, 50 bucks. Please sign here. Are you kidding me? You'd charge me for food waste? "Food waste"? Don't talk to me like that. Choose your words carefully. You don't have to eat it, if you don't want to. Wait... Give it to me. Eat up. Green pepper, carrot, broccoli... You're messing with me? I told you, I don't eat this. Five vegetables per day. You might not get all your nutrients. You got more value and volume at the same price. How can you be so ungrateful? - Eat it. - No. - Eat it. - I'm going to explode. I don't care. I made it, so you have to eat it. - I already told-- - Mom says you waste food, you go to hell. - You'll go to hell for making me eat it. - Shut up. Just eat it. Here. What is it? Floor plan and maps. You have to memorize the names and locations of all the shops. I will test you in three days. Who can memorize all this? You really think you're a supervisor? This is part of a floor manager's responsibility. Which side is the front? This way. This side is the front. Read it like this. Where is this place? The floors are all labeled. Just memorize it chronologically. Ms. Zheng. You eat two lunch boxes? No, one of them is Qin Zi Qi's. You pack his lunch and you wash his lunch box? You must take real good care of the newer employees. It's not like that. I charge him for the food. Charge? He's boarding with me now. I take care of his three meals. If Shi Te Long fires me, maybe I can have a second career selling lunch boxes. Why would he be boarding with you? It's more convenient that way. He lives downstairs from me. He must be trying to court you, that's why he's asked to board with you. No way, that's impossible. He's not my type at all. Anyway, he ran into some trouble. Now he doesn't have any money for food. Since I cook at home and prepare my own lunch, I just make an extra portion for him. If I don't have any money, will you prepare an extra lunch box for me? You would never see that day, come on. You're the assistant manager. Quit joking around. I'll head back to my office now. Qin Zi Qi... What are you doing? Look, this mannequin is placed in a visually odd position. I have to adjust it. If all of our employees were as hard-working like you, we wouldn't have to bend over backwards to beg Yu Cheng Feng to open a shop. That's right. Finding a random person to open a shop won't necessarily boost our sales, right? You seem to have a lot of ideas for the company's operations. I have a lot of ideas, but no one wants to listen. Especially our supervisor. All he does is talk a good game. It's really a bore working for him. Do you need new blood at the Leasing Department? Don't laugh. I mean it. If you transfer me to the Leasing Department, I'll do my best and make the impossible happen for you. I like a newcomer with ideas. Let's chat some time. I'm curious about your ideas. Why not today? What time do you get off of work? I'll treat you to... I've made plans with a client tonight. Some other day, then. What's your phone number? Why don't you come with me to meet with the client? You can see what we do at the Leasing Department. I can also hear your ideas. Would that work? It would, definitely. Come see me at the Leasing Department after work. Sure. Sheng Xin Ren, did you hit the jackpot? There's meat and rice... Why did you buy so much food? You won the lottery? I've never won anything in my life. Then why are you making a feast? It's Qin Zi Qi. He's so old yet still a picky eater. Is that right? You guys are so sweet... Not at all. I don't want to keep hearing him complain I'm feeding him food waste, like a pig. You're so good to him. Aren't you worried he might fall for you? I think he's more likely to fall for you. That's what I thought, too. I like your honesty. Here's to you, for tonight. I didn't know Leasing Department's job includes eating feasts. We're going to host a Gourmet Week event. I've been eating like this for days. My weight is through the roof. Come on, you're so skinny. You should eat more. What are your ideas for the company's operation? I don't know about the other departments, but Operations Department has a lot of problems. What problems? It's a long story... Here's to you. You don't need to wait anymore. He must be out having a good time. Come on, let's eat. That's odd. He doesn't have any money. Where can he be off to? You can call him. Why should I call him? You seem to have special feelings for Qin Zi Qi. Not at all. Only because I felt bad about what he did. If he hadn't signed the package for me, he wouldn't end up having no money to eat. That's because he's dumb, all right? What are you looking at? Come on, eat up. Nice watch. Can I take a look? It's fake. A counterfeit. It's a perfect replica. Jason. You... QIN ZI QI FATHER: QIN MU BAI Qin Mu Bai. Mr. Chairman.
