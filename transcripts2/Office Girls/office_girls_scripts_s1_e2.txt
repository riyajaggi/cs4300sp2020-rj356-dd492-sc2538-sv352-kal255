 It's because of employees like you. You're either stupid, or take joy in other's misery. You're either only wise after the event, or prefer to do less than more. With people like you, sales will never grow. Excuse me, apart from criticizing and complaining, what else can you do? I'd love to do something, I just lack the opportunity. Of course you have opportunities. You can help Xin Ren take care of Yu Cheng Feng. Whoever caused the trouble should take care of it. It wasn't me. Lu Cha,

 I don't need the help of a rookie who only reads magazines at work. Thank goodness. I'm not too keen on working for a supervisor who only has seniority but no skills. - What did you say? - Can't you understand Mandarin? - Why did you touch my Yu Cheng Feng? - So what? I told you not to touch it. Yet you keep doing it. Mr. Shi, I don't want to take this case. Can't you find someone else to do it? Sheng Xin Ren, why don't you tell him rule number one for rookies? You're not entitled to think. You can only do your best. The thing is, I don't want to do it. Then quit your job. Sheng Xin Ren, I already told you. This guy is your responsibility. You must answer for his mistakes.

 Take this to Management. I have a meeting with a client. - Take it to Management. - Who knows where that is? Fine, I'll take this to the Management. You draft a proposal for brand leasing. Give it to me tomorrow morning. The proposal is done. BRAND LEASING PROPOSAL LIST WHATEVER CONDITIONS YOU WANT! Qin Zi Qi. Stop right there. What kind of a proposal is this? "List whatever conditions you want"? You call this a proposal? Yu Cheng Feng isn't just any random brand. He's the only Asian designer who has won three consecutive design awards in Paris. That's why I said, list whatever conditions he wants. Location, commission, interior design, whatever he wants, he gets. If he won't take these amazing conditions, it's no use trying. Don't try to argue your way out of this. Don't you know what positions we hold in this company? "List whatever condition he wants"? What if our bosses don't agree to them? Take it back, do it over. I don't want to waste time on meaningless things. "Meaningless"? You can't just get a designer to open shop and expect sales numbers to improve. Jing Shi Department Store needs a complete overhaul. Change the antiquated personnel model. Change the rigid thinking structure. Understand? "Understand"? You're just a rookie who can't even write a business proposal. Don't you find it laughable that you stand here and speak like this? Who do you think you are? Heir to Jing Shi Department Store? I know you don't understand what I'm saying, because your wage is like your ability-- so little and so poor. Yes, my wages are meager. But every penny I spend is a penny I earned. You're an egomaniac who doesn't know his credit card has maxed out. Who are you to lecture me? If you're so able, why don't you get Yu Cheng Feng to open a shop here? At the very least, you can write a well put-together proposal for me. It is well put-together. Never mind, I'll write one myself. If your female admirers all lined up, they'd circle the building three times. I don't want to get beaten to death. But... I'm only serious about you. Last time, I brought up the idea of collaborating and opening a shop... If I didn't see a possibility, I wouldn't have asked you to come. Let's go. That's so cruel. Your dad really wants you to start in an entry-level position? And I can't reveal my identity. The wage is 30 grand... NT Dollars. If I had known, I'd never have come back. So sorry for your situation. Jake's here. Kai Er, wait for me here. Two glasses of champagne, please. Who is that? She works at the Leasing Department at our company. What I told you is absolutely top secret. You hear me? Here you go. Thanks. Let's go. Paul. Jason, when did you come back? I got back today. - Kai Er, let me introduce you... - I know who he is. He works at our Operations Department. - When did you enter... - Jake. Come here for a second. Please, sit. Is he your boyfriend? He's a client. For luxury brands to open branches at our store, I have to maintain good relationships with those people. "Those people"? Sounds like you don't think very highly of them. They're worth billions of dollars. I'm just a regular office girl. I hope they don't think lowly of me. Don't you worry. Those people are kind to girls, especially a beauty like yourself. Is that a compliment? Kind of. I think it's kind of sad. A man's worth depends on his wealth. A woman's worth depends on her looks. Wealth can increase in value with time. Looks is the opposite. Don't you feel sad for women? What about you? The person you were talking to is Paul, heir of Dong Han Development. Jake is the heir and purchasing director of Delicate Jewelry. They look down on other people, never sit with people other than their own kind. I'm guessing you come from a well-to-do family, too. We are elementary school mates. They're rich. I'm not. Nice watch. Can I take a look? It's fake. A counterfeit. It's a perfect replica. If you like it, I can buy one for you. I'm just a nobody from the Operations Department. I have to get up early for work tomorrow. I best head back. I'll buy you one, next time. Father, I hate you. I'm home. You're back. I think there's a new neighbor moving in downstairs. Really? I wonder what kind of a person he is. Must be a "One No and Three Withouts" person. Why else would he move in here? What's "One No and Three Withouts"? Without a car, money, or house. No need to pay attention to him. Isn't that like us? Should we go downstairs and say hi? I don't even return any of my friends' "pokes" on Facebook. Let's say hi when we run into each other. Could our new neighbor be a crazy musician? More like a weirdo with severe bipolar disorder. You still want to go say hi? I'm taking a shower. The new neighbor's bipolar disorder does seem really serious. Sheng Xin Ren, it's already eleven o'clock. Where is Qin Zi Qi? I called this morning, but he didn't answer the phone. He didn't answer? So now this is my problem? Find him, or it's your behind on the line. - Mr. Shi. - What now? This is the proposal I worked all night on. Can you look at it for me? Why? What good would it do? Am I the one opening a shop? Take it to Yu Cheng Feng. Now? Of course, unless you want to wait until next year's Lollapalooza? But he has a fashion show this afternoon. Then go try to see him at the fashion show. But the fashion show isn't open to the public. You figure something out. If I have to do everything for you, why should I have you in my employment? Hurry and go. Sir, don't get so worked up. Would you like a cup of coffee? Caramel macchiato, large. No problem, coming right up. Hello? Qin Zi Qi, you finally picked up. Do you know what time it is? Where the heck are you? Guess. Qin Zi Qi. What is it? Hop on. I'll rip you a new one for going AWOL later. What are you looking at? Yu Cheng Feng's fashion show is about to start. This is a business outing. Why didn't you send a car to pick me up? Who do you think you are? You want a luxury bus to pick you up? Hop on. Can I get a different helmet? Fine, I'll hop on. It's just my luck. - Do you even know how to ride? - Sit still. What are you doing? A dog! - What the heck? - Do you even know how to ride a moped? Why don't you do it, then? Go ahead. I don't know how. What? You're a guy and don't know how to ride a moped? I can do four wheels. Can't help you much on two wheels. If you can't ride then quit complaining. Sit still. You... - Can you ride straight, please? - Sit still. - Straight line. - Quit bothering me. God, help me. What? You can't even ride. Quit blabbering. YU CHENG FENG - FASHION SHOW Please leave if you don't have invitations. We have invitations, we forgot to bring them. That's right. We're reporters. Let us take photos, so we can report back to our boss. I'm sorry. We got orders to only admit those with invitations. Please leave. Let's go. Come on. We can't get in this way. Why don't we just wait out here for the end of the fashion show. Come with me. What? What is it? What are you doing? Grab a flower basket. We'll sneak in by pretending to be delivery people. You're stealing. These flowers are for him, anyway. We're just kind enough to help them take the flowers inside. Can't we just wait out here until the fashion show ends? Are you certain you will be able to see him? If you don't deliver the proposal to him, I'm sure you know what would happen when you return. If you want to face that, I don't care. By the time you figure it out it'll be too late. Can't you be more at ease? Aren't you worried they'll find out we snuck in here? This is my first time at a fashion show, and it's Yu Cheng Feng's. I own every book he's ever written, every magazine he's ever been featured in. I've read them over and over, but I'd never seen one of his fashion shows. Ditz, work. Work. Very good. You can get all ditzy after work. Check out that chick, she's so hot. Ditz, work. Work. You're quick. Yu Cheng Feng! Thank you all, distinguished guests and members of the media, for coming. We will now take questions from the media. How come we didn't see Wei Min Na? Are there other questions? Wei Min Na is your brand, your top model, and your girlfriend. How come she's not here today? She had a pressing matter to take care of and couldn't be here. Thanks. What can be more important than your fashion show? Thank you all. That's all the time we have for our press conference today. Thanks. There are rumors going around, saying you two got into huge fights - and you've broken up. Is that true? - Sorry, please no pushing and shoving. You once said Wei Min Na is your muse. If you break up, would your creative well dry up altogether? That's just uncalled for. Today is Master Yu's fashion show. You should focus on the clothes instead of prying into his personal affairs. Master Yu's new collection has maintained his signature style. Combining different elements and hand-stitched sleeve seams, displaying a luxurious Eastern simplicity. How would you imply his creative well has dried up? That's just so inappropriate. Thank you for your interpretation. Which media outlet are you with? I... I'm not a reporter. I'm Sheng Xin Ren, from Jing Shi Department Store's Operations Department. We're here today to invite Master Yu to open a shop in our department store. Sorry, this is all the time we have today. Thank you all for coming, thank you. Thank you all. Wipe your drool and let's go. Why did you keep pulling me? Annoying. Assess the situation before you speak. There was no way he could say yes, under those circumstances. Why do you keep raining on my parade? I had to try. This is just a friendly reminder. Don't get too ditzy. The higher your expectations, the bigger the disappointment. I think we should be positive. The higher the expectations, the bigger the hopes are. I think this is a foolish way of thinking, trying to fool yourself and others. You're a fan of that jerk. You must know he's a difficult person. Watch your mouth. He's a master. You're a jerk. - If I say he's a jerk, he's a jerk. - He's a master. You're a jerk. What "master"? A master is like this... - A master is... Why should I go along? - Excuse me. I'm Mr. Yu's assistant. My name is Michael. Mr. Yu asked you to meet him for coffee at this place. He will be there in 30 minutes. Do not be late, no matter what. All right? Okay? Look, he invited us to have coffee. How come you're invited too? If only Master Yu had only asked me. What did you say? Yu Cheng Feng invited you to have coffee? Work hard and bring back some good news. Boss, they're here. Please sit. Would you like something to drink? - That's fine. - Double Espresso. And ice cream. Blueberry, thanks. Thank you for coming to my aid in front of the media. You also very clearly explained my design style. I've always been a fan of you, Master Yu. I really like you. I have every book you wrote and every magazine you appeared in. Thanks. This is our Brand Leasing Proposal. We'd like to invite... I'm sorry. I'm flattered by your invitation, but I will not open a shop in a department store. Do you want to read our proposal? We put a lot of effort into it. What's the point? If you don't want to open a shop, why bother asking us to come? - What are you... - It's true. You think I'm really here for the coffee? - Come with me. - What? My apologies. Let me take care of this. - Take care of what? - Come with me, let's go. I'll be right back. I can walk. What are you doing? We're here to ask him to open a shop, not to fight. - I was just telling it like it is. - Stay out here. Do not come in. Look at his attitude. You stay outside. Mr. Jason. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Jason is here. How do you like your new place? It has a door for me to enter, windows to let in some air. It has a toilet for me to crap in. I'm fine. Have you contacted Mom? So you snuck into the press conference? Yes. Sorry. That's fine. I'm glad someone appreciates my work more than the gossip about me. You know more about my work than the reporters present today. I asked you here to thank you. I'll also let you know, I will not open a shop at a department store. I know you only do direct retail stores, you don't do department stores. But we're really sincere in our invitation. You can list whatever conditions you want. Ms. Sheng, let me repeat myself. Thank you for what you did today. No, Master Yu, I really admire you. I even bought your clothes before. Thanks. You should go now. Why did you just come out of Mr. Chairman's car? Do you know him? I don't. You don't? That's odd. Why did you come out of his car if you don't know him? I got it. Your last name is Qin. Mr. Chairman's last name is also Qin. You can't be Mr. Chairman's... Sheng Xin Ren, I'm going to tell you something, but you cannot, under any circumstances, repeat what I'm about to tell you. Or you'll be the first one I fire in the future. - Is it that serious? - Yes. I'm Mr. Chairman's son. Talk if you must, but do not come so close. Come on, do you think I'd buy that? You should do some research if you want to fool me. Chairman's son had an accident last year in the U.S. and is now a "vegetable". Everyone knows this. A "vegetable"? That's right. He's the kind of rich heir that spends his father's money carelessly abroad. He's been studying for a few years. Who knows if he's even graduated? Why were you in Mr. Chairman's car? I'm the driver's relative. Driver's relative... Why did you have to lie? I don't mind you getting in by pulling some strings. People like that are everywhere. But I think you should work harder. Your parents begged Mr. Chairman to let you come work here. If you keep not showing up, how can you do right by them? How well I do or don't do is none of your concern. Qin Zi Qi! So emotional for a guy. Chairman's son had an accident last year in the U.S. and is now a "vegetable". Everyone knows this. He's the kind of rich heir that spends his father's money carelessly abroad. He's been studying for a few years. Who knows if he's even graduated? Xin Ren, you're back? How dare you call her by her name? That's too familiar. Call her Ms. Sheng. Wait, no, Specialist Sheng. Well? How was coffee? What's the situation? Do tell me. So I can prepare the documents for your promotion. He already turned you down. Quit hanging onto false hope. Mr. Shi, I'll try to talk to him again. He already said it's impossible. What good would it do? Sheng Xin Ren, is it true, what Qin Zi Qi said? Mr. Shi, I'll try harder. If you're incapable, it's no use, no matter how hard you try. You should've told me you can't do it. Don't play me for a fool. You got my hopes up for nothing. I have to be the last one to know? What? Are you messing with me? Think you're a big shot because you got four years of perfect attendance bonus? If I get punished because you can't figure out this Yu Cheng Feng thing, you will be surfing help wanted ads all day. You want to cry? With two clowns like you in the Operations Department, I should be the one crying. Missed. I sincerely apologize to you. I'm sorry. Mister, do you live on the fourth floor? I think so. That's great. This is a package for the upstairs resident. But I don't think there's anyone home right now. Can you please sign for the package for them? Sure. Thank you. Can you please pay for the package, too? No. Please, Mister. Just pay for the package and get the money from the lady upstairs. Otherwise I have to come back again. It's really far. Please, Mister. I'm sorry. Please, just pay for it now. You can ask Ms. Sheng Xin Ren from upstairs to pay you back. Sheng Xin Ren? - She lives upstairs? - That's right. You two know each other? No problem, I'll look for it right away. Right, you work on the report. Write it in the format I told you, then give it to me right away. Yes, one A4 paper size. Enlarge the font. Clear statements. Itemized main points. Yes, very good. I'm very busy. That's it for now. Bye. Sheng Xin Ren, how come you brought home a bunch of work again? Has everyone in your department died or something? They ask you to do everything. It's not like this is only happening today. I had no idea there would be endless work to be done. If you keep this up, you're going to die from overwork. I can't believe he threw you under the bus in front of Shi Te Long. Want me to talk trash about him in front of Deputy GM Fon? That's not necessary. Annoying as he is, Shi Te Long won't go easy on him. Qin Zi Qi? What's he doing here?
