 Mr. Shi, are you blind? Watch where you're going, all right? My goodness. I didn't mean to do that. I'll help you pick them up. You should respect me, I'm your elder. Nothing good ever happens when I run into you. What? You're the one who wasn't looking where you were going. Here you go. Creep! Sleaze bag! Disgusting, grotesque dirty old man! Lele, what's wrong? Xing Ren, he snuck up and kissed me! My lips are going to rot!

 No. It's just a coincidence. It's a misunderstanding. It's an illusion due to the camera angle. How dare you, germy man? Mr. Shi sexually harassed a female employee in broad daylight. We must call the cops. No! Yes, a man like him should be put in jail. He shouldn't be allowed out in society. Please, don't. Wait a minute. I'm totally innocent. What is this? A public trial? Disgusting, dirty cockroach! I despise you!

 Low-life! I despise you! Lele! Low-life! I despise you! No! Why are you against me, too? Help me think of a way to explain it to the other colleagues. You can't lie to those who already know the truth, Mr. Shi. You should pick up the documents, get rid of the evidence, flee the scene. Hurry! Mr. Shi! I can't believe you'd do that. I've always treated you like a big brother. You say that, but keep all the good things for yourself. Enough, already. You're an animal! Please! Just kill me now and end my misery. Low-life! I despise you! Why me? I've got Shi Te Long's germs all over my lips. Will my whole body rot and decay? Lele, come on, don't be mad. By the looks of him, I don't think Shi Te Long did it on purpose. Just think of it as charity. I must visit the temple when I finish work. Otherwise, I'll be doomed forever because Shi Te Long kissed me. Do you want me to go with you? No, I'll ask Michael to go with me. I'm going to rinse out my mouth. OLD YU Hello, Old Yu? Xing Ren, you called? What is it? Nothing really, I just wanted to see how you were doing. Not very good, actually. Sorry for making you listen to me complain so much. Don't be sorry. I'm really good at cleansing out negative energy. Don't worry about me. Min Na is actually a very kind-hearted, very straightforward person. She's very candid and very adorable. But she can sometimes be absentminded, like you. Yet she's very hard-working, otherwise I wouldn't have loved her for so many years. Then why did she come to Jing Shi Department Store and specifically ask for PB's shop location? She was just throwing a tantrum. Throwing a tantrum is her way of expressing her love. She cares about me. She loves me. So she was doing that to make me return to Paris with her. You mean, she threw a tantrum and acted against you, because she loves you? Are you thinking, how can these two adults be so immature? I don't believe a mature, dependable man like Master Yu would act like you. He won't turn into an idiot at the sight of a beautiful woman. You don't have to believe me. When people fall in love, they follow their heart, not their brain. Being mature and dependable mean nothing. Min Na is very important to me. But I'm also afraid, one day, I won't be able to stay with her. Shen Xing Ren, I think I probably do like you. Shen Xing Ren, I think, perhaps I do like you. Shen Xing Ren, if nothing unexpected happens, I maybe do like you. She's the one who's always been there to help me. She's always been my most intimate lover. But we seem to be growing apart. If you care about her so much, why don't you try talking to her again? Getting into a fight takes two people. I'm sure Wei Min Na is also upset right now. You're a couple that's envied. Maybe you should treasure each other even more so. All right, I'm done complaining. I'm drunk. I should get going. Master Yu! I'm sorry. I'm fine. Are you all right? What "Master"? You're a con man all along. Qin Zi Qi! Qin Zi Qi, what are you doing? I've put up with you long enough! Qin Zi Qi! What are you doing? Stop it! Why are you flipping out? What's the matter with you? Why did you hit him like this? He tried to force himself on you. What? Master Yu is just drunk. - He tripped and fell. That's all. - Who are you trying to fool? Why are you doing this? Why are you always acting so strange? I was trying to protect you. Who do you think you are? Did I ask for your help? Apologize to Master Yu. Never-mind. I should get going. I'll walk you out. What are you trying to pull, Qin Zi Qi? I have something to say to Master Yu. Good, I'd like to speak to you, too. Sit. You have something to tell me? You said you wanted to speak to me, too? Why are you so mad? That was a huge reaction. I'm thinking, if I were you, I would definitely stand up for her. But I wouldn't have reacted like that. I apologize for what happened. I accept. I should also apologize to you, because I hit you back. But can you tell me, honestly, what does Shen Xing Ren mean to you? Colleague, friend, neighbor. She boards with me and does my laundry. She gives me rides to and from work. - That's it? - What else? I think Shen Xing Ren means a lot to you. I don't know if you're just insensitive, so you haven't realized it, or you won't bring yourself to admit what your heart feels? Think back carefully. Every time you have an angry burst in front of Shen Xing Ren, what is it for? Everything you do continues to prove that you care for her very much. You're worried she might be mistreated. You're worried she might get bullied. That's why you always stand up for her and protect her. You keep to your Wei Min Na. Stay out of my business with Shen Xing Ren. You like Shen Xing Ren. Yes, I like Shen Xing Ren. That's why I'm warning you, you best stay away from her. Do you feel better now that you've said it out loud? She's a good girl. She's a good girl who deserves to be pampered and cherished. Be good to her. Why would I let Qin Zi Qi walk Old Yu out? I hope he doesn't go berserk again. Old Yu went home? Yes, your Master Yu has left us. You didn't hurt him again, did you? You're so weird. Why did you overact like that? You came up swinging fists without asking any questions. Thankfully Master Yu is a bigger person and forgives you. You're lucky. He's the one who's lucky. If you weren't in the middle, he'd be dead meat. Scoot over. Why? I'm going to dress your wound. You didn't know you got hurt? Don't you feel the pain? Now you feel the pain? You didn't feel it when you punched him? Be gentle. I am being gentle. Don't be a baby. Why did you hit me? Why did you kiss me? I didn't mean to. Do you want to die? I couldn't help myself. You... You're dead meat! How could you kiss me? Why would you do that? I'm dressing your wound. How could you kiss me? All right. It's not all right. Don't you know that no boy has ever kissed me besides my father? How could you kiss me? Why are you so weird? You couldn't help it? What a lame excuse! Shen Xing Ren, you belong to me. Then who do I belong to? Why did you sneak up and kiss me? Why? Tell me? You're bad. How could you sneak up and kiss a girl? You're a bad egg. What are you doing here? Why aren't you going to work? I was thinking, maybe we should-- Qin, are you trying to get Xing Ren to take you to work again? You're taking advantage of her again? Nobody's taking advantage of her. You're trying to save on the commute fare, that means you're taking advantage of her. When you have money, you take Zheng Kai Er to dinner and a movie. Xing Ren is so nice to you. She cooks for you, does your laundry, and she acts as your driver, too. Have you ever done anything for her? Have you taken her out to dinner or to the movies? Or have you given her an expensive, handmade dress like our handsome Master Yu Cheng Feng? I can't afford it now but that doesn't mean I can't in the future. Someday I will give Shen Xing Ren everything she wants. What? You don't believe me? Who would believe you? You should first pay Xing Ren back the debt you owe her. Everyone can make empty promises. Xing Ren, let's go to work. Mr. Shi. Are you regretful or remorseful? After that shameless, animalistic display, how you do feel now? Very anxious and worried. Can I take Monday off? Take the day off? Why? It's Lele's birthday. Why? I have to stand in line. I have to buy that new cell phone for her birthday present. Lele? Did you say it's Lele's birthday? Yes, hurry up and sign off on my day off request. Yes. Sorry, boss. However, Lele's birthday-- What's that got to do with you? Are you so sweet and considerate for your mother's birthday? I won't sign off on it. Not this year, next year, or the year after. - Why? - Why? Because we have to revamp the website. You will be very busy. But I already did that last month. Yes, because our customers reacted so well, you will be revamping the website every month. Go, get busy. But Mr. Shi-- Mandy, why are you laughing? I'm not laughing at all. Well, laugh now. Why are you laughing? Why did you unfriend me on Facebook? Am I not good enough for you? I think someone stole my account. I didn't unfriend you. So busy early in the morning. So annoyed. You're yawning? You got here later than I did. I should be the one yawning. Shen Xing Ren isn't here, either. Shen Xing Ren is Ms. Perfect Attendance. She would never be later than Mr. Qin. She's already making the rounds. It's all Liu Yu Le's fault. She was nagging me all morning. Otherwise I would've been here already. Qin Zi Qi, let's go talk outside. What is it? - Boy. - What? Can I ask you a question? I've been unable to concentrate since last night. I've got no vigor for work, can't focus when I drive. Can't sleep at night or wake up in the morning. Why is that? Why? Kidney problems. How did you know? You ran into evil spirits. Give me your hand. My assessment is-- Have you been spacing out a lot? Do you laugh and smile for no reason, like an idiot? Yes. You're in love. Open your mouth and stick out your tongue. From the depth of your throat, I think you have a crush on someone. Yes. I've been feeling like, like I got swept off my feet. Who had the misfortune of being responsible? It's that-- How dare you? You think you can walk all over me now? Are you itching for a scolding from me? I was opening up to you, man-to-man. How can you make fun of me? I'm so hurt. Who is it? It's-- I'm too embarrassed to say her name. You can't even say her name? What is she? Voldemort? How can you say my lovely goddess is Voldemort? You won't tell me her name. I don't understand your acting method. You're so mean. Haven't you ever been in love? Don't you know, when you're in love, you can't help it, you just blush whenever you think of your love interest. And I-- Who are you thinking of now? What a vixen. You've already got Zheng Kai Er. You still want more? Who were you thinking about? Mr. Shi, Zheng and I are really just friends, nothing more. Last time I got caught, I used that excuse for the reporters. Did they believe me? Seriously, though, who is it? I'm not going to tell you. I know who it is, even if you don't tell me. Shen Xing Ren. Is it that obvious? You think I'm blind? Anyone with functioning eyesight can tell. How come we haven't seen Qin Zi Qi and Zheng Kai Er having lunch together lately? Did they break up? How should I know? It's none of my business. Xing Ren, you've been acting weird since last night. Did something happen? Something with Qin Zi Qi? Not at all. I know something happened. I can tell by your expression. Qin Zi Qi and Shi Te Long, two dirty creeps. Why are they having lunch together? It is odd. Since when is Qin Zi Qi friends with Shi Te Long? What can they talk about? Two dirty germy men are having a party together. Who knows what kind of scummy things they'll talk about? I lost my appetite at the sight of them. Let's go. Lele. Boy, come here. I'm treating you as like friend. I'm telling you my deepest secrets. It's kind of odd, I've worked with Lele for so long, how come I don't know anything about her? Come on, do tell. What kind of person is she? Aside from being Medusa, she's quite all right. Why are you asking about Liu Yu Le all of a sudden? Well, no. I'm a manager, can't I ask about a fellow colleague? Why do you ask? Why can't I ask about her? You have a crush on Medusa. What a vixen. I really don't get it. Why would you fall for someone like Xing Ren? Maybe it's her silliness that makes her so attractive to you. What good is becoming a team leader? At least I can get a raise. Then I'll get even closer to realizing my dream of buying my mom a place. And your Dream House? I just have to start over. I believe, as long as I keep working hard, one day, my dream of buying a house will come true. What does Shen Xing Ren mean to you? I don't know if you're insensitive, and haven't realized it, or you won't bring yourself to admit what your heart feels? You like Shen Xing Ren. A penny for your thoughts. You got hurt? It's nothing. Just a mosquito bite. Must be a huge mosquito. Thinking about something? You can share it with me. Don't you think things have gotten a little complicated now? What things? Our co-workers seem to have the wrong idea about our relationship. What wrong idea? Even Shi Te Long thinks we're more than just friends. So? Does Xing Ren think that too? We are more than friends. Aren't we? I thought you think of me as someone more than a good friend. You are a good friend. That's fine, then. I should get back to work. Go on. No! Go on! I'm scared. Go on! I don't want to! You again? It's me, again. Lele, are you getting off work? None of your business. You-- I can give you a ride. Imported luxury turbo engine. No. I have plans with Michael. We're going to the movies. Lele, what do you see in Michael anyway? He's just a plain-looking boy. You're the plain-looking one. Michael is handsome. You're a dirty old man. Goodbye. She chose moped over twin turbo. True love. Right? Not at all. What's Michael's appeal anyway? He's just got a more prominent six pack. Slightly more attractive in the shower. I'm the guy who made the term "hunk" popular. When I shot sexy calendars, you were still in your diapers. Mr. Shi? What are you guys doing here? Car maintenance is really important. Got to check the oil and water. Especially when it's too hot. You guys go ahead. I'm heading home. See you, Mr. Shi. Wait, no. What? I'm going home with you. Why? You can just take the bus. I don't want to. You're all gone. How am I going to play all by myself? What? I didn't mean to sneak up and kiss you yesterday. What are you doing up here? What's for dinner? What? You go home and eat whatever you want. I've decided to keep boarding with you. Who said I'd agree to it? You can agree to it now. Why? Don't you know it's hard to live on a grand? I have to pay for utilities, rent, and everything else. I'll be broke before the end of the month. That's why I decided to keep boarding with you. Why? I'm not your nanny. Why do you come to me all the time? Even though your food isn't very tasty, the food you make has a certain Je ne sais quoi. What? It's love. You put Mrs. Shen's pickled veggies in your food. Mrs. Shen's pickled veggies are made with love. Are you going to let me or not? If you don't, I'll tell your mom. - Are you using my mom to threaten me? - Yes. What? Will you? Fine. I'll let you board with me. Shen Xing Ren, the very moment you said yes, I suddenly found you so hot, so pretty, feminine-- Take back "feminine." I'll keep "hot" and "pretty." Is it soy sauce pasta again? How did you know? You're so smart. Can't you change the menu? Like curry chicken? Or short rib? I don't think so. If you keep rambling, you won't even get soy sauce pasta. You'll just get blanched broccoli. Master Qin. - What? - You think this is a cooking show? If you have time, wipe off the table for me.
