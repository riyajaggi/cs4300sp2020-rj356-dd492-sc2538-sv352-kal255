 Maahox! Must you always be so creepy? I'm sorry, my Lord. It just comes so naturally to me. I see you've taken quite well to your Haggarium spa. Instead of your radiation and injections? Yes, this is a preferable way to absorb its power. I can feel myself becoming stronger with each bath... Which sounds strange now that I say it out loud. Strange is good, my Lord. Ah! Unfortunately, it isn't enough to erase the wound of Voltron.

 Increase my dosage! Yes, about that. Your preferred method of treatment is quite inefficient. We are running through our Haggarium supply far too quickly, and my other projects... You have projects deemed more important than me? No, of course not. You are my everything, sire. I'll just get more. Lots more. Could you also get me a refill? Of course, my Lord. Perhaps you'd like a neck rub as well. Evil is back.

 The Drule King Lotor has returned with a dark energy that can destroy the galaxy. Our only hope? The Voltron Force, a team of five heroic pilots that control five awesome robot lions. When Lotor's monstrous Robeasts attack, the lions come together to form Voltron, defender of the universe! I got ya! And then Daniel had to save me... Again. Oh, I'm sorry. Am I boring you? So, someone else is having trouble sleeping. Allura? What's got your brain running? It's sort of embarrassing. Why don't you take a stab? Well, it's just that... I've come to accept the fact that my power has made me an integral part of the team, and I need to be in the thick of the action. But, well, I'm still not sure... I'm brave enough for this role. How can you think that? You've proven yourself many times over. Have I? I feel like someone always needs to put themselves at risk to save me in every situation. That's why we're a team. We're all here to make each other stronger. Nobody needs to act alone. Allura, we need you in the control room, stat. See? The team needs me. Don't let this keep you up, Vince. You have nothing to prove. We've detected large traces of Haggarium moving through a remote part of the galaxy. Based on its path, it appears to be headed for planet Doom. It must be a shipment of some kind. Exactly. But the size is unfathomable. If Lotor were to get his hands on this massive quantity... There's no time to waste. If we leave now, we can intercept them here, near Poseidous. Sounds like a plan. What about the cadets? Should we wake them to bring them along? Let them sleep this one out. I know one of them needs it. No, I don't. What I need to do is come on this mission with you. You don't have to do this, Vince. Yes. I do. I'm the only one with the raw natural power to combat Haggarium if something goes wrong. The kid has some solid logic there. And logic is King. You can ride with me, if it's okay with you, princess. Looks like we've got a convoy of Drule fighters protecting the tanker. Well then, let's get rid of them, shall we? Wait! We can't risk damaging the tank's hull and releasing Haggarium into space. Pidge is right. The effects of a spill could be catastrophic. I'll take point on a "V" blockade formation. Remember, this is a containment tactic. Do not fire unless fired upon. This is commander Keith of the Voltron Force. We'd like to negotiate a peaceful surrender of your vessel's cargo. Commander, with all due respect, from one fleet leader to another... Hey, Keith, I respect you. Touching, Lance. Engage. Remember not to damage the tanker. We need to disable the Drule ships without firing our weapons. That's why we have claws and jaws. Yellow's hungry! Ha-ha! You're out! Sir, they have located us. We won't be able to hold them off much longer. I'd call you an incompetent fool, but there's really no need to kick you while you're down, commander Cossack. I appreciate that, Sir. As long as you know it's implied. Initiate our contingency plan so that the cargo isn't a total waste. Yes, Sir. Hey, Pidge? What would happen if the Haggarium spilled into space? Theoretically, it would form the equivalent of a soul-devouring black hole of evil, but we're winning this thing. Why do you ask? No reason. The probe pod! Vince, did you... Vince, what are you doing? Being brave, risky, and slightly disobedient. Sorry! What's going on here? The Captain is about to initiate the tanker's self-destruct sequence. How do you know this? That's not important. What is important is that I can stop it if I get direct access to the mainframe control terminal. This is reckless, Vince. You're being very Daniel right now. Exactly. Open wide. I hope all your systems are this easy to control. He really boarded it, didn't he? Vince, evacuate the ship immediately! That's an order! I'm really sorry, but I can't. I'd expect something like this from Daniel, but not from you, Vince. Vince, there's still time. Get out of there! Gotta deactivate the bombs. I almost got it... I'm going in for him. Come on, come on... Aw, snart. Vince! Vince is still inside that thing! Oh, this is all my fault. I should have never allowed him to come on this mission. I can't believe he's... Guys, I'm all right! Vince! Thanks, guys. Nice to feel loved, but I need to concentrate here. No, you need to evacuate! Now! If I can stop these explosions before the fourth bomb goes off, it won't breach the tanker. I just need a few more... Vince, you don't need to prove yourself to us. Actually... he does. There's not enough time to rescue him before the next blast. Vince, good luck. Thanks. Self-destruction mode activated. Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One... Self-destruct mode, de-activated. I-I... You did it! - Awesome! - Way to go, man! I did. And I think I just talked to the computer with my brain. Um, guys? No! Quick, after him! No! Come on... Princess! I'm sorry. Don't be. What you did was incredibly brave, and prevented a disaster. Don't worry, Vince. The others are on their way. I'll be right here with you, you got that? No! Allura! Vince! Vince, is he... I just couldn't hold on. Well, we're all here to hold on now. Let's keep diving. Maybe we're close to the bottom. Pidge? I'm not sure. Very little is known about Poseidous... Or the creatures that live in these waters. More importantly, nobody knows the depth of these oceans... If they have a bottom at all. Uh, Pidge? I can still hear you. Kind of freakin' out right now. You? Not helping! Vince, we still have you? Have you hit bottom yet? You mean the bottom that might not exist? No. Haven't found that yet. Hey, pal. I know you're probably on the verge of losing your mind right now, all alone, sinking hopelessly, maybe running out of air... Running out of air? Really not helping! Look, Vince, you're a logical guy, so you can keep a clear head by sticking to data, functions, things you can control. Talk things out. Now, let's start with the tanker's emergency protocols, huh? Okay. Good idea, Pidge. Looks like we're taking on water. Sealing off all compromised areas. Good. Keep talking it out. Now, let's check out the ship's vitals. Leaking air, mixed pressurizations, and on the verge of imploding. Okay, data not keeping me calm. Just keep talking it through with me, Vince... We'll figure this thing out... Pidge? Pidge! Pidge, come in! Allura? Keith? Anyone? Completely alone. Add that to the list... Okay, those horribly freaky sounds aren't some monster. They are just the ship's natural sounds... From the collapsing pressure. Not helping. All right, Pidge, not sure if you can hear me, but I'm gonna keep talking to you. The Haggarium hold is still intact, so, that's something... I think we just hit the bottom. Another for the plus column. Wait. This isn't the bottom. Aw, come on! What is that? Okay. Safe for now... As long as Haggarium isn't leaking into the water, we should be good. Anyone else having trouble seeing down here? Shift more power to your eye glow. Thanks, Pidge. Now I can see nothing much better. Seems like the systems and coms are getting a bit glitchy. Stay close, everyone. The lions have never been tested at these depths. They should hold up under the pressure, but... Where's Hunk? Pidge? Anyone? Do you read? There you are. I'm coming. Okay, not gonna freak out. Gonna talk through logic. So the ocean is through that door... And the corridor below is flooded with the monster in it. The communication satellite is still intact! Maybe I can boost my signal to contact the others and give them my location. Oh, come on! I need to get to the mainframe again! All right, option "A" sit here and hope they find me in a giant ocean before I drown a freezing death, or option "B" go in... There. Hello? Guys? My com still seems to be wonked. Can you hear me? That is not a lion! Hunk? Do you read? Come in! Huh, I think I might have something here. Yeah, found him. Are you guys all right? Now I am. There is one big monster down there. Like... big! Not that I'm scared of it... Now. Well, hopefully, we won't run into it again. We need to keep diving to get to Vince, so... New strategy... Our coms only seem to be working at short range. We need to stick to a tighter formation. You know, and I'm just spit-ballin' here, but we... The Voltron Force... Are sort of known for a particular formation that keeps the lions together. Underwater? Will that work, Pidge? Only one way to find out. Activate interlocks! And I'll form the head! It worked! You guys can praise my genius later. He's too heavy. We're sinking fast. We can catch up to Vince, so that's a good thing, right? Not if the systems don't have a chance to equalize. Quick, Hunk, Allura. Activate retro jaw thrusters. Lance, Pidge, you too! Whoa. Everyone cool? Pidge? I think we found Hunk's friend. You're not so big now, are you? Uh, I'm done talkin' smack. Let's see if I can do that again. This is disorienting. It's going to be harder and harder to pinpoint Vince's location. It's like playing action limbo in a mine field. Well, keep it up. If we don't provoke them, I think we'll be okay. What if they provoke us? Let them sniff us out. They're just curious. Everyone remembers what curiosity killed, right? Gotta reach the satellite. Maybe I can use this creature as an electrical conductor. It worked! Now, hopefully, they can pick up my signal. We're going to need to engage these pretty soon. We're invaders in their waters. We can't harm them. Guys, I've got him! Okay, Pidge got my signal. Now I wonder if I can ride this creature right out of here. Ho-ho! If Daniel could see this! Oh, no, don't touch that Haggarium! The pressure! We got you, Vince. Looks like we're just in time. I don't know about that. The aquatic creatures are becoming infected with Haggarium, and it's making them aggressive. Form blazing s... No! We can't harm this creature. It's not her fault. We need to neutralize her and this spill. Not sure this is the time to be an environmentalist. Vince, I know you've been through a lot. How much do you have left in your tank? Enough. Form blue center! You're the head. Show us what you can do. With your help. Very Poseidon... Or is it Neptune? Technically, they are quite similar, but one is Greek and the other is of Roman descent. However, considering the planet we're on... Not now, Pidge! Let's freeze these fish! My turn. I'll heal them with my power! It worked! Very cool, guys. But I think we need to think bigger. If the Haggarium reaches that swarm... Vince, you have to help us neutralize it. There's just too much. I need more time to gather the strength. And it won't freeze! Haggarium's freezing point is well below water's. Wait! I have an idea. I just hope Voltron has enough juice left to pull it off. Good call! Let's freeze the water around the Haggarium and trap it inside. It's working! Come on... Almost... Looks like we made a Haggarium iceberg. Let's get this popsicle up top. See? We save you, you save us, we save each other. That's how a team works... What now? That's what I was worried about. The freeze Ray drained too much power. I don't think we'll make it to the... My turn! Form yellow center! Haggarium has been iced. So, after that last transformation, I imagine Voltron is completely drained. And so is Vince. So, no power to neutralize the evil candy center, and no power to get home. So, what now? Uh, Pidge and I have been working on this "power issue." Pidge, take the honors. Voltron's gone "green." Not quite yet. I'm sure our brave, risky, and slightly disobedient savior will get us there soon enough.
