 Get a move-on, kids. The second sun's almost set! Whoa! What's the matter? Go! Go, go, go! I'm guessing... molten lava, not good for crops? Hunk, Allura, a little help here? I think we might be getting full. We need to divert this lava, and fast! Well, let's dig in! It's working... But red's sure gonna have heartburn tonight. Less wit, more people-saving. We have to seal up that mountain. Allura, not the time for a water break.

 Think about it. You've got fire, I've got water, and Hunk's got Earth... what does that make? A cool band name? I think she has something else in mind. Good ol' Voltron Force concrete! Is there any problem you can't solve? Feels good to play with fire and not get burned. Mission accomplished, Pidge. I wouldn't celebrate just yet... Something still isn't adding up. There are no active volcanoes anywhere near those farms. Well, something caused them to erupt like that. Exactly. I'm running a sat-com analysis of the area.

 I'm gonna need Lance to score me some soil samples to figure out what caused this natural disaster. Guys, I don't think it was exactly... "Natural." Whoa. Big hole. You can say that again. - What do you think made them? - "Them?" Uh-oh. I defer to my associate's scientific analysis... "uh-oh," indeed. Evil is back. The Drule King Lotor has returned with a dark energy that can destroy the galaxy. Our only hope? The Voltron Force... a team of five heroic pilots that control five awesome robot lions. When Lotor's monstrous Robeasts attack, the lions come together to form Voltron, defender of the universe! Okay, here's what we know. I ran an exo-scan of Arus' surface. It appears 23% of all mountains around the planet have identical holes to the ones near the farm. It's not just mountains. Something's hitting forests and lakes, too. Question is... what's doing it, and why? Could be a giant stray bowling ball. Well, maybe it's you, 'cause you stink at bowling. I got a strike once. On the wrong lane. Guys! Not important right now. Something is playing pinball with our planet, and we have to find out what this thing wants. It's us... Mountain, tree, lake... it's trying to locate the lions. Of course! It's systematically searching Arus for the location of the lions' dens. How long until it finds one? 22 and change. Doesn't give us much time to stop something no none's even seen. Wait. Maybe no one's seen it 'cause it's not on the ground. I'm widening my search parameters to include the planet's exosphere. Bingo! I'm still voting "bowling ball." Whoa... What is that? It's moving at hyper-mach 3! It's so fast, I can't even capture a clear image of it. But it's not faster than our lions. Actually, it is faster... Way faster. We've never even pushed one of our lions past hyper-mach 2. Yet. Thanks for joining us, boys. We just finished our flight-deck training simulations. Thought we'd come check out where the real action is. I'm already on it, kid. I'm taking red up. Need a co-pilot? Never. But you can tag along if you wanna watch me set a new lion-speed record. Okay, both of you, wait. We don't know what we're dealing with, let alone if you can even catch it... I can catch anything. Way I see it, there's only one way to find out what this thing is, and that's... hit it head-on! Oh... sorry. Blew your cool line. Shall we? Okay, we should be picking up this thing on the sat-scan by now. You see anything? Whoa! Yeah, not sure we need a sat-scan for that. That thing is fast! Well, so am I. Whoo! That thing moves like... Hunk on a buffet? I was gonna say lightning, but yours works, too. Lance! What are you doing? Just boosted my speed by rerouting all power to my tail thrusters. And away from your shields! You're completely vulnerable to an attack. Yeah, well, I'm also pushing hyper-mach 2, which I believe you said was impossible. Lance, you need to back off. You're already red-lining it. The lions have limits. How's about giving me a crack at the controls? Speed is sorta my department. I got it covered. Come on. I'm so fast, I'm already in next week, high-fiving you, 'cause we kicked its butt. Let's not forget, you're the one tagging along here. Last thing I need's a back-seat driver. It's banking back again! You need to re-route the power back to your shields. Not if I outrun him first. Maybe I can help? You saying I can't do this on my own? That I'm not fast enough, cadet? No. I didn't mean... remember, I was the red lion while you were still playing with your Voltron toys. Yeah... but my Lance action figure didn't get all snarty on me. Lance, come in! You can't keep pushing red like this, or your systems ... Come on, boy. Hold it together. Hold it. Hold it... Our systems are failing! Yeah, the sirens and flashing red lights kinda tipped me off. Guys, you've got a problem. According to our scans, your lion is emitting a low-frequency homing signal. It's tracking you as we speak. Whatever you do, don't go back to red's cave. Remember, this thing's trying to find out where the Voltron lions live. If it wants Voltron, let's give it Voltron! Pidge? You there? Red's fading fast. Don't worry! Your plasma cells can recharge when we form Voltron. Activate interlocks. Dyno therms: Connected. Infra-cells: Up. Mega thrusters are "go." Let's go, Voltron Force! Form feet and legs! Form arms and body! And I'll form the... Whoa! What was that? Speedy just disrupted our formation sequence! Where'd it go? Let's not wait around to find out. Activate interlocks! Dyno therms: Connected. Infra-cells: Up. Mega thrusters are... Look who's back! We have to form faster if we want to beat this thing. Regroup! How's about we skip the preamble? Form feet and... there's no way this thing's gonna give us the time to form Voltron! So what do we do when that happens? It's never happened. This is what you call a first! And it'll be our last, if we don't get back to the castle. - But... - no "buts." Retreat! How? How is it possible that we can't form Voltron? Well, from what I saw, it smashed into us over and over, and over... And then three more times. Oh, I can't believe this happened. With all due respect, I can't believe it hasn't happened till now. Daniel, shh! No. This is gonna be good. I'm just sayin'. Well, no one's askin'. Lance, let him finish. Look, I've been Voltron's biggest fan since I was a kid. I've studied every aspect of how you guys operate, even timed how long it takes for you to form Voltron. 36 seconds. That's kind of a long time, don't you think? Considering we're forming a... million-foot robot, that's not long at all. It is in the middle of a battle. You can't just expect your enemies to stand around. You really think the bad guys are gonna say, "sure, you go ahead, "and become the defender of the universe... "I'll just patiently wait over here for the next 36 seconds"? It is kinda crazy that no one's ever attacked you when you're at your most vulnerable, until now. Don't you think? All that matters now is finding a way to form Voltron faster. Pidge, any thoughts? That would require a substantial speed upgrade to every lion. That's a tall order. I need a lot of time. You have six hours. Hey, Lance. We need to talk. I can't talk. Busy fightin' Lotor. I know, but I was thinking... why don't you leave the thinking to the big boys? Okay? Pidge is on it. That's just it... the turbo upgrade he's looking for... What if it's... SIM, off. Look, I appreciate you wanting to help, but you're a cadet, and your seasoned superiors just got our robo-butts kicked by something we can't even see. - Well, maybe I can... - you can what? What can you do that our many years of experience can't? Pidge said it himself. He doesn't know how to boost the lions' speed. Ho-ho! So now you're faster than me, and smarter than Pidge? No! Well, maybe I'm a little faster than you. Okay. See this, cadet? This... is the line. This is you... crossing the line. Don't ever cross the line. Wow. I dig systems upgrading, but that's... a lot of math. All you have to do is recalibrate the thermodynamic generator and focus the resulting power to the mega-thrusters. It's a start... But not nearly enough to win the fight, don't you think? Vince? Note to self: The smart cadet doesn't like math. What the... - Shh! I need your help. Ever think of just asking? Maybe a simple "psst" or a wave? Sorry. It's just I don't want anyone else to know what I'm doing. Oh, a secret mission. Why didn't you just say so? So you'll help me? No, not today, man. I need to help out with the solution to the speed problem. You're looking at it. You don't want to know what I think I'm looking at right now. My Voltcom power is turbo-speed, right? Well, I have a theory I want to test out in the red lion. I'm thinking, if you help me link this into the cockpit... it might give it the speed boost it... wait... You're suggesting we take out the red lion, aren't you? You know what happened last time. Lance and Keith will go super-nova on us. I've always been there for you, Vince. Gotten your back. Now it's time for you to be my wingman. Come on. What do ya say? Okay. Red's up and running. How do I link in? Just like this... Now let's see what this cub can do. Okay, but go easy on the... This is awesome! We clearly have different definitions of the word "aweso-o-o-ome!" It's working. You were ri-I-I-I... a-a-ahh! I'm picking up a signal. Something's incoming... and fast! Not as fast as us! Let's open this lion cage and let 'em out. I thought we already did. You ain't seen nothin' yet. Come on, boy! Hold it together this time. Hold it... hold it! We're at hyper-mach 1. 1.5! Hyper-mach 2! Here comes the... Hyper-sonic-boom! Hah! Now we're talkin'. Stay on it, Daniel. I'm capturing a mag-res image of it now. Got it! Weird. It's... a giant eye. Okay, we know what we're dealing with. Let's head back to the castle. Sorry, wingman. Mission's far from over. I give you an inch... and I take a parsec... I know, I'm awful. Hey, eye. Did you see this coming? Oh-ho! How's that taste, buddy? Actually, you're the one biting down on it, so, technically, you'd be the one tasting it. Yeah, I get it. Yeah, you'd better run... eye! Daniel, that was amazing, man! Yeah! Okay. Now we can head back to the castle. Can't wait till my man, Lance, hears about this. You defied my direct orders. In my lion. What on Arus were you two thinking? No clever response now, huh, kid? Actually, I had a few. Just thought it was best to keep them to myself. Please stop talking. Please stop talking. What did I tell you? "Don't cross the line." Do you have any idea how far beyond it you are? Well, I did hit hyper-mach 2, so I'd guess pretty darn far? Maybe I should just go now? Stay! All of you. Hey, I've got it handled, Keith. Is that so? 'Cause if you ask me, you should be thanking the cadets, not lecturing them. Excuse me? Discipline issues aside, Keith's right. Daniel was the only one able to snap a clear image of the probe. Turns out... not a bowling ball! He also gave red a turbo-boost, which, in theory, means we may be able to form Voltron faster. Huh. Not to mention, Daniel even managed to wound it. That means, we know there's a way to beat this thing... Yeah, yeah. Kid's a real hero. Message received loud and clear. I was thinkin' hoagies for lunch? Thoughts? I should thank the kid? Unbelievable. I gave him direct orders, and he defied every single one. Sounds like someone else I know. Please. I was never that reckless. No... you were worse. You can't deny, what Daniel did was impressive. None of our lions have ever gone that fast before. Doesn't mean he can pilot red better than me. No one said he could. No one had to. But someone needs to remind that cadet that I'm the red lion. Lance, those cadets are here because their special abilities will enhance the Voltron Force, not break it apart. You know that. All Daniel wanted to do was help the man he admires most. You think I'm being a jerk. Your words. Not mine. Don't worry. Your time in the red lion is far from over. Lance! Come in! We're under assault by the giant robotic eye, and, yes, I'm aware how insane that sounds. Time to close the curtain on the drama and blacken this eye. The castle sure is taking a beating. How are we not rubble? That eye is able to bowl through mountains. Pfft. This place is way stronger than some puny mountain. Hunk's been upgrading our defenses for the last five years. Yep. That's reinforced super-steel alloy with sub-wexler enforced bracing. We can take a 9.9 earthquake and not spill our juice... Or soda... or milkshake... or... all liquids, got it. Just one problem... According to my calculations, we can only take an assault this intense for another hour, Max. We need to take down that evil eye before we become the bowling pins. Not a problem. We've got a secret weapon. Get ready, Daniel. Okay, team, just like our speedy protege planned... this bad boy won't know what hit him. Wait for it... Wait for it... flash-form, go! Yeah! Hah-hah! Whoa! Don't celebrate yet, kid. Let's keep our eye on the prize. After it! I liked him better when he was just an eye. Plasma cells are fading! Lion boosters! All you, Pidge. We're not even making a dent on this thing! Wait! I have an idea! We're all ears, cadet. I think it's time for that cyclops to see what happens when we sharpen our blade with a little speed. Way ahead of you. Form blazing sword! I can't seem to catch it. Daniel, whatever you got, do it now! Speed-boost! Yeah! All right! That's what I call cutting down the competition. Hah. You're also excelling in one-liners, cadet. Keep your fists up. Ahh! Oh... SIM, off. I guess I'm not as good as you. At some things. Listen, I like to think I'm a big enough man to apologize when I've been a... - Really big... - Don't make me regret this. You did good, kid. Really good. Well, in the future, I promise to ask before taking red out for a spin. Or at least super-charge it with your speed so I don't catch you. Scan of Arus' exosphere is complete. No sign of any more probes. So... it's over? Or it's just beginning. That probe's mission was to find out where the lions are hidden, and it may have succeeded. We need to find out who sent it, though. I think we can take a pretty good guess. I see you...
