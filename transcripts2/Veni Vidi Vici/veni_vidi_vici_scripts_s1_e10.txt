 Let's not get too worked up, OK? Of course! But this anger must come out. Shoot, boys! Shoot like hell! Why is there a man on our couch? That's a good question, considering we have a spare room. Sit down and eat. That's Vincent, my producer. We got home late last night and he preferred the couch. Dad is making a commercial for Nike. - Yeah. That's cool. - We'll see. We're pitching an idea, so we need to do some brainstorming. - That's why Vincent is here. - Right. The stud. - Now I remember. Nyhavn! - What? Nyhavn! You know, when Lotta and I were there

 and you came into the restaurant. It's him! - Vincent? - Yeah. He was standing outside with those porno actors. - I'm sure it was him. - That's impossible, Jonna. Vincent was in Aarhus all day. He was out scouting locations and stuff. It couldn't possibly have been him. - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. He sure looked like your friend. Yeah, but it wasn't him. That mustache makes him look like a porn star. [scoffs] - Kiss... - Bye- bye. [door opens, closes] Wake up. This is much too dangerous. You need to leave. Take it easy! The brothers won't ever come to Sweden. It's too cold in this shitty country. Denmark is on the other side of the water and is colder! - Is there any coffee? - Quiet. Come. - Is there any coffee? - Come here! [Angela] What the hell are you talking about? [Pinxo] All this talk about his films... You're a die- hard fan. - You have the hots for him. - Shut up. Shut up! - Shut the fuck up! - Fuck you! - You piece of shit. - Come on, let's do this. Hello? Hello? Hello! Anybody here? Vinny? Huh. What the fuck? [humming] They don't teach you to knock? - There's no fucking door to knock on. - What do you want? What the fuck is that? Hm. [music on headphones] - Yes? - Where is Vinny? I don't know where he is. - Do you know what happened to all the milk? - Yeah, the milk... The police came, but it's not a problem. Me and Topper, we, we... threw it all away- - Wait, wait. You helped who with what? Topper Harley, the director. We threw it all away... - [silencer fires] - Oh, shit. Shit. Right. Where's the broad? Who do you think you are? That's not your movie. Well... Who are you and what would you know? Without me, Cum- Tiki was a fucking yawning contest. OK? It is my movie. Now everyone knows. Thanks for that, whoever you are. Goodbye. - So... - What is this fucking parade? Where is Vincent? And where is fucking Topper Harley? I'm Topper Harley. [fires] That wasn't Topper Harley. If you keep shooting people like this, we're screwed, boys. Fuck- ups. - OK, how long will you be away? - One or two days. Or a week, at the most. Not more than a few days. We need you here. Jonna, it's an important campaign. It's fucking Nike! We need some peace and quiet. - OK, and where are you going? - Don't know, somewhere in Smaåland. - You don't know where? - Vincent rented a cabin. But I don't know where and for how long. But you'll be alright for a few days. Sure, but a whole week is too much. OK, I'll be back in a few days. Alright, darling. Bye. - [Vinny] Sausage. I want some sausage. - [Karsten] I want a new life. Stop complaining. What the fuck? Who could complain if not me? [Vinny] Some toilet paper. This could be a lifesaver. I still want sausage. I want Bullens hotdogs. You open the lid and put it right on top of the fire and boom! Dinner's served. To the king of the camping. Listen, we're not camping. We're going to Wille's place. I know where he hid his keys. So let's hide there a few days. Bullens hotdogs work everywhere, even in his apartment. As long as we're not camping. [phone rings] What's up? Uh- huh? Yeah? In Sweden? Cool, thanks. - What's up? - I think we found Vinny. Ah... Nice. It's really nice. - What a dump! - You're one to talk. What the hell... Fuck it. It will do, yeah. If no one took it, Wille's key should be right here. - He told you that? - Yes. [Vinny] Why? What? It's just weird. "Welcome to my place..." Someone's talking to me... Wow, you're like this close. Come here. Stop it! Tell Zlatan and Taåmmy to come. - How's it going? - So- so. AÅke wants to see us three in his office. - Now? - Now! You can play more afterwards. - Now, Zlatan! - Yeah... Don't peek at my cards. No cheating. He was on his knees and found the keys to Wille's apartment. - The Danish guy? - Yes. He was with some mustached horse- dealer type. - They entered Wille's place? - Yes. What does this mean? Does anyone have an idea? - Zlatan? - The Danish guy? Maybe he's watering Wille's flowers. - Wille's flowers? - Yes, or they'll die. If you don't give them water, they will die, right? I agree with Zlatan. He's watering the plants. They were good friends. I mean, if Zlatan dies, I think I would do the same thing. - Water Wille's plants? - Yes. No, Zlatan's plants. If he had any. I mean, why should they die just because Zlatan is dead? But Zlatan isn't dead, so there's no need. Goddammit! Are you completely brainless? He might be involved in Wille's murder. And now he's inside. Maybe to find or remove something that could tie him to Wille's murder. Good thinking, Taåmmy. Where are they? Before I say anything at all, I want something from you. What do you want? I want Vinny's part in the business when you're done with him. I don't trust you, you Nazi fuckhead. But I don't trust you, you lesbian fuckhead. - I'm not a lesbian! - Prove it. - Fuck me! - Yeah, that's what I meant. Come and fuck me. Shut up! OK. - What's it going to be? - OK, you can have Vinny's job. Alright. But first... [chuckles] ...you must admit that the Holocaust did in fact happen. - What? - The Holocaust. Admit that you Nazi scumbags killed over six million Jews. - No fucking way. - Do you want Vinny's job? - Yes or no? - Yes. Then we want to hear you say what the whole world already knows. - Except you Nazi scumbags. - This is fucking stupid. - This is fucking ridiculous! No way! - Say it. No... Fuck no, I refuse! I refuse. No way. - Say it, motherfucker! - Say it, fucking Adolf piece of shit! - Wait, wait, wait! - Say it. Say it! - OK, it fucking happened, OK? - What happened? The Holocaust, it happened, OK? We killed over six million fucking Jews, alright? Fuck! Who else did you kill? Did you kill gay people and gypsies too? We killed everyone, OK? We killed everyone. - Yeah, that's right. - [Pinxo] Respect. Fucking gypsies, gays, wheelchair people, circus clowns... We killed everyone, OK? - Alright! So right, guy. - OK, that's fucking good. You're good at it. - Whoo! - [sobbing] So, now... Where are they? Hm? They're up there. - Was he into birdwatching? - No, he was a butcher. OK. See if you can start the computer. - Let's check some dailies. - Dailies? Mm. I thought we could do some work. I brought a USB drive, so we can search for some bonus material. There are movie buffs who buy the DVD just for the bonus material. - That's fucked up. - [AÅke] What are they looking for? Oh, well... Who's that? Sorry, darling... Am I interrupting something? - [knocking] - Pizza delivery! Where the hell did I put it? Hey... Cut it out, there's no one there! Hello? Where the fuck are they? They went out the back. Fuck! [phone rings] - Hi, Jonna. - Hi, baby! This isn't a good moment. Should we go for baubles in gold or silver this year? - Yeah. Yeah. - Sh... - Karsten? Karsten? - [hangs up] Then it'll be gold. [pigs grunting] [humming "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?"] ♪ Who's afraid of the big bad wolf? ♪ ♪ The big bad wolf the big bad wolf ♪ Pinxo... Pinxo, please... Who am I gonna shoot first? Mm? - The genius? Or the fuck- up? - No... Fuck- up? Genius? Genius? Fuck- up? Fuck- up? Genius? Drop your gun. - Aren't we a team? - I won't let you do it. - I thought we were a team. - Drop the gun! - You're so predictable. - Drop the gun. So shoot. I emptied the magazine. It's not loaded. You're fucking with me. - [gun clicks] - Oh, shit. It's almost too easy. It's like shooting fish in a barrel. Wherever I shoot, I hit a pig! Huh? Please! [fires shotgun] Drop your weapons! OK. Drop your guns. Wait. Where are the brothers? Boys, drop your weapons. Look... This is very... How the hell do you say onoödigt? - "Not necessary." - Yes. Not necessary. [muffled shouting] [gunshot] [gunshot] [two gunshots] [yells] What's happening? Tell me what happened! Taåmmy? AÅke? [yelling] What happened? I'll fuck his mom! Who did that? Where are you? Let me go! You idiot! Let me go! What the hell is going on? Who are you? Are you connected to King Kong? Who the hell is King Kong? - What should we do with her? - What's your name? - Angela. - Listen now to me. Little Angela, I want to expand my business and I think you can help me with that. Would you like to work for me? Or let us put it this way. Either you work for me or I'll let my boys introduce you to my hungry pigs. - [Karsten vomits] - What do you say? For fuck's sake! What the hell is wrong with you? AÅke, I would really appreciate it... if you didn't tell Jonna what I've done. Mm- hm. I understand you. [laughs] Porn director! In Karsten's defense, I should say that he's an incredible director. Yeah, but it's still porn, right? Well, I guess. Jonna would be devastated if she found out what I've been doing. And disappointed. Like so many times before. Yep. Uh... This is what we'll do. I'll take control of the Belgian business. And you keep on directing and producing porn. But now it's my money you'll be laundering. Not Belgian money. Does that sound fair? Will you produce mother's milk? Well, I never say no to a good business opportunity. And this is a brilliant deal! [chuckles] OK. But what about Jonna? Jonna? She doesn't need to know. So everything will just go back to normal? - Exactly. - Sure. Why not? Huh? - I'm done with porn. - Karsten... That's not how this works. If I tell you to do porn, that's what you'll do. If not, I might give Jonna a call... and tell her what you're up to. Do we have a deal? Look at this as a family business, where we all work towards a common goal. - Mother's milk for all! - [AÅke chuckles] Make porn, not war. What do you say, buddy?
