 Last night I realized that I'll never see Oscar again. This had to happen. It's logical. We're in this shit show with you, you're not alone. When I wake up tomorrow, he won't have left the kitchen table covered in crumbs. Or the lid off the marmalade. His alarm won't wake me up at 6 am. He won't have used my towel to stand on when he gets out of the shower. The only thing I have left of him is a letter and a horse. Hey... If you like I'll come stay for a few days and leave crumbs on the table. Thanks. We're taking you home, okay? Right after you have a shower. You'll feel better. -I can't. -Of course you can. Come on. -I can't. -Come on. -Yes, you can. -Come on, I'll help you. Come on. -Find her some clothes, Ada. -Where, Mom? This place is a pigsty. -I don't know. -Upstairs. -It's like this because we were robbed. -What do you mean, "we"? -There's a suitcase up here. -Bring it down. How could she not be a mess? She's living here with her dead husband's lover. Sleeping in the same bed as her. This woman has the bed in the middle of the living room. -Well, it is a loft, Blanca. -No, it's a statement. Like a neon flashing sign. Do you have your cell to take photos? Ada... What's this? -It's full of photos of vaginas. -Give me that, Blanca. -I don't know why you're looking. -Do you have some clothes? -Yes, they're right here. -Bring them over. I know why Oscar wanted to stay here, now. You feel free here. Time stops. It's always summer. Verónica was the love of his life and I get that. You don't know that. Yes, I do. He had a normal life with me, a normal partner in me. Like millions of other normal couples. I'd have liked to be like her, but I didn't know how. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ALEX I'm making you some tea. Girl... You're going to be fine. We're in this shit together and the only thing you have to do is spit out those memories. Hi, it's Katia. Alejandra left her phone at my place. How is she? Fine. Good! She slept all night and now she's great. Katia. We have to sign with Satch and Trust today, I've pushed it back until 8 pm to give her time to reconsider. There's nothing to reconsider. If she says she has a better idea then she does. -I'll see you there in a few hours. -Katia... Are you okay? I'm fine, just very busy with Alejandra and the project. I'll see you later. Bye. Here. That was Big Boss. He's moved the signing back. You don't have to come with me, but tell me your idea and I'll sell them it. What idea? Your idea, Alex. The one you went into our boss' office and blocked a 311 million deal for. That was because you've had a better idea, right? No. And, honestly, I don't give a shit. Alex... It's taken us seven years to get this project going. Seven years. Would you like to explain why you don't give a shit or have another idea, please. Because I want to die. Martina? I brought you some chocolate. You know what I think? Going there has made her lose her mind. -Did you know she was living there? -I knew she went occasionally, when she said she was at the bank or sick. You saw it, they're sleeping in the same bed. You don't know if they were sleeping together or just sleeping. -The Grey heron? -She's pretending to be a biologist. -It's her alibi. -Her alibi for what? So they don't know she's Oscar's wife, to understand Verónica, to understand her own marriage, to try new things... -Sex with strangers... -Sex with strangers? -What's in her tea? -Don't change the subject. You knew my daughter was sleeping with strangers? She didn't sleep with him, he only ate her out. I caught them at it. Alright, alright. But that's it. She went off the idea with her panties round her ankles. -What? -I'd feel confused too if my husband had threesomes with fishermen. Oscar is bisexual? My daughter told you all this and you left her alone? In the state she was in? -It wasn't like that. -It wasn't? She's lying in bed, a total mess, and you, knowing she was running off the road, never stopped her, is that it? Blanca... I don't think any of us is helping like we said we would. -Hello? Alejandra? -Speaking. I'm Montse's assistant. Therapy? -Sorry... therapy? -Yes. -Which therapy? I go to a few. -Family members of suicide victims. We're starting the session at 4 pm instead of 6 pm, can you come? -Yes, I'll be there. -Great! Can you remind me of the address? My car's in the shop with it inside. -Yes, it's 67, French Avenue. -Thank you. Mom, what group? Where are you going? To speak to her therapist to get Alex out of bed right now. In the black shirt, five-time world champion, Fran Pacheco, and in the brown shirt, my husband, who has yet to win any world titles, but he's my husband! Guys, three, two, one... Go! Come on, honey. Run! -You cheated, you bastard. -No! You tripped. -What? -You always were the clumsy one. -Don't take the bait. -He pushed me! -Don't you two start. -You saw he pushed me! -Use your skills. -Rematch, right now. Hey, we're celebrating me not getting the job in Argentina. -Chickening out? -Really? Three, two, one, go! Fran, help me! -Mom? -Yes, it's me. How are you? You've always been so strong. You were a difficult child. Quiet... closed, but very strong. And you still have that same strength. If you're life with Oscar wasn't good enough... ...you have to start from scratch. From the beginning. A new life. Better. Is that the letter Oscar wrote to Alex? Alex has been holding on to this like a life belt. As her mother, I feel obligated to know what's in it. Blanca, you drugged her to get the letter and copy it for your book. Me? No! I take four Valiums any given day. Now, beyond your high-brow teenage righteousness, I'm curious about something. What are those photos of vaginas on your cell? -Well... -Are you a lesbian, honey? They're photos of my own vagina, which has a big following. -So you display them? -No, I don't. People ask for a picture of my vagina and I send it to them. With a dedication. Don't tell me you're shocked. Me? Shocked? With what I've lived through. And... Does it pay well? They're personalized photos. Every client asks for a certain shave, a specific dedication. In Chinese, Japanese. -You don't know how hard Chinese is. -I can imagine. Wouldn't it be better to sell generic photos from the internet? -That would be a scam. -Come on, it's a vagina, not a Picasso. -Nobody would realize. -What exactly bothers you? That you would debase yourself that way. That you sell your privacy to some Chinese perverts and they masturbate over your photos. That's what. Why does it bother you? Because they're Chinese? You know exactly what I mean and you know what? I'm calling your mom and telling her. We'll see if you can still go to New York. Seriously? While you're at it, tell her you're selling your daughter's privacy in a paperback. Me? -Hi. -Hi, how are you? -How are you? -Hi. What's this? A girls day? I guess this is a bad time to see Alex? No! Come in. A bomb could drop and she wouldn't know, but a bit of testosterone would do us good. I lost my self-esteem when my husband committed suicide. After some time, I began looking. When you feel like that you think that love can get you through and that desperation makes you cling onto just about anybody. Anyone who'll listen or responds to your messages. I confused the scraps of time this person gave me with love. I hit rock bottom and this time I decided to use an alternative therapy from Herman Jodorowski. And he told me that if I wanted to leave I should make love to him one last time and then afterwards defecate there in the room. So I stayed, we had sex and when he fell asleep... I started staring at the ceiling. I don't know if I was driven by the shame of doing it or the need to believe that he could change. And I thought, "What kind of woman do you want to be? What do you want to become?" So... I stood up and defecated on his rug. -And did it work? -Yes, I never saw him again. Thank you, Silvia. We're almost done. Anybody else want to talk? I'd like to say something. I've been coming here for three years to listen to stupid stories. Stories of self-pity and I'm done. I've reached my limit. I mean, Montse, is it okay to shit on somebody's rug? Really? What are you? A fucking Labrador? -Jesus. -Conrado, how do you feel? I feel like the king of the world. Ever since I stopped the meds, I'm great. -You were supposed to wean yourself off. -I did, little by little. But that isn't the point, Montse. You're not our mother. We're not little kids. How long are we going to keep coming here to tell our stupid stories and to be given a pat on the back. How long? It disgusts me to think I've been here three years whining, relating my misfortunes. Becoming a sniveling wreck. That wasn't me, it was me on meds. So thanks for everything, but I'm done. That's all we have time for. See you next week. -I'd like to talk, Conrado. -I have nothing else to say, Montse. -I appreciate it, but no. -As you wish. -If you change your mind, please call. -Thank you. Hi, I'm here to discuss a friend of mine who comes here, Alejandra Leyva. -Alejandra, of course. Take a seat. -Thanks. She won't talk. All she does is lie in bed. She says she wants to die. I'm at a loss. Sure. It seems she's finally grieving. Could you come with me? To get her out of bed or prescribe her something? We should leave her for now. The grieving process is natural and unavoidable. And it's all the more painful the longer ago the incident is. So it's a good thing that's she's finally there. -Light? -Yes, thank you. -What's wrong with your friend? -Her husband recently committed suicide. I... know Alejandra. I brought her here, I'm from La Albufera. What exactly do you know? I know that she lives with Verónica in La Albufera and... and that she's pretending to be a biologist called Martina. Right. How come you let her do this? Well, I guess that... I identify with her. And because when you're in that state you need to take it all the way. You stand by them and follow them to the depths of their fits and lies. Whatever it takes. -Hi. -Hi, Katia. How's the new idea coming? -Good, really well. -These people will be here in two hours. I need sketches, blueprints, anything you have for it, please. -It won't be ready in two hours, Yama. -Excuse me? This isn't an apartment refurb, we're talking about a skyscraper contract It'll pay your salary, your friend's and everyone else's. If she doesn't like it, she can do something else but tell her the one I commissioned is sold. She must come... sign... then... what... I won't let her sign something that isn't amazing. You've got a Michelangelo, so stop whining, dammit. -What Michael Angelo? -Michelangelo. Michael fucking Angelo, the one who designed the Sistine Chapel! Alejandra is Michelangelo. So let her finish her master piece. I'll talk to you later. Sorry. Tell me what you do in La Albufera. I'm a cop. Well that's... great. In the region of Valencia... there's a species in danger of extinction which is the focused architect, because she hasn't realized her husband has made her an awesome sandwich and she's not paying any attention. -We don't want to scare her. -What are you doing? But I'm going... You can't work this much, ladies and gents. -You can't work this much. -Do I get a bite or what? You'll get this building done like the champ you are, but right now we're going to stop working because it's Saturday. Shall we go to the beach? -Let's go. -You and I? -I love you so much. -I love you too. How are you? Alex... I loved Oscar a lot too. Remember when you and my mom went to the Shanghai Tower? I was 11 years old and I stayed here with him. He's the only man I've lived with. And that was the year I got my period. I was so embarrassed to have to tell him, but I had no other choice. I'll always remember the scared look on his face when I told him. He showed up with a box of tampons and waited outside the bathroom door. He said, "Ada, is everything alright? Are you sure you know how to use one or should I look online?" Typical Oscar. Alex... I was there every day when he called you at 1 am to say good morning. And I don't know if he went to see another woman when I was at school or on weekends, but I heard him talk to you every day from my bed and he adored you. Thank you. Were you scared? -You stalled again. -There's too much to remember. It doesn't matter. Start the engine. Put it into gear. We'll pretend you're overtaking. -You have to indicate. -Right. And you have to look in the rear view. -That way! -But we're going this way... Stop! Stop! Stop. You've run over another cone, honey. -Sure I have, there's no room to turn. -How isn't there? -No. -We're in the countryside. -You're putting me on edge. -If it's so easy for you, you do it. Alex... Alex, slow down. Don't look at me! -What are you looking for? -I saw it was Oscar's stuff and I was looking for his ID. I need it to effect a transfer of powers. I told him to look in there. I thought Oscar was fired five years ago. Well... He was working freelance for me. We moved capital for some companies. And have you been in love with my daughter all this time? Excuse me? -I don't know what you... -I mean how you look at her. Like a puppy lovesick over his best friend's wife. You're fantasizing and putting me in a very awkward position. -So, please... -When you came to use the pool, you'd take a swim, sunbathe, you'd bring her iced tea, devotion in your eyes, fascinated, in a way you never looked at your wife. -Well, you never looked at your wife. -Blanca! He can look at who he wants. Why are you bringing this up now? Why did you never tell Alejandra? Why didn't you tell her the truth about Oscar? Can't you even recognize your own feelings? Look what's left. A corpse. And a ruined woman. Here's Oscar's ID. Thank you. Hi. Blanca, this is Conrado. Alex? -What are you doing? -Happy birthday. -Don't film me. -I have to film you. -I'm half asleep. -And I love that. I want to remember this forever. I've made you an amazing breakfast. -I don't believe you. -I did! -Really? -Yes. Can I open the door? Mom, how many Valium did you put in my tea? One... or two. -What is it? Why are you here? -I bumped into Katia at therapy. Therapy? I came for some papers and to see you. -Are you feeling better? -Can we talk a minute... You need to see a proper therapist. In fact, I booked an appointment with Dr. Ferrer. Remember him? Can we talk for a minute, please? Just the girls. I'm sorry I went to your therapy, but we didn't know what to do. I'm sorry I left you to it all this time. I abandoned you and you lost control, but I promise I'm with you with any crazy idea you have from now on. Crazy ideas? You pretend to be me to take all of your shit out on Verónica and you call my ideas crazy? -You asked me to. -I asked you to help me! Not to make her feel how you do for screwing your boss. -What was your name? -Conrado. I'm the Police Sergeant in La Albufera. What is that woman to you? Your best friend? Or the most special person in the world? -Maybe she is, Mom. Maybe she is. -What's going on with your self-esteem? You're someone worthy, intelligent, highly gifted. -I'm not highly gifted, Mom. -You are. It came out in the results of Dr. Ferrer's tests. -Because you were sleeping with him. -It's not true. I think I'll come back, I don't think this is the best time. Fran. Nice to meet you. Want to know why I was a difficult child who spent all day studying in her room? -Why? -Because I couldn't bear your pain. The intense pain that you allowed to extend throughout the house. Your husband cheated on you, but he was also my father and you wouldn't stop until he was ruined. You used me against him. You made yourself out to be a cool mom who took her kid with her to every event she went to with her friends. I just wanted to go to the zoo. I wanted to ride my bike and be a normal kid, but you wouldn't let me. So I hid away and studied. To not be the performing seal at all the parties who showed the world how well divorced life suited you. The first person to ever let me feel anything and be the person I really am was Oscar. So I'm asking you all to stop judging my marriage and feeling sorry for me because we had an awesome relationship. Awesome. Okay, sweetie. You'll find your way. Everyone thinks their life is worse than it actually is. At some point... we all want to be someone else. Live in another city, have different goals... I don't know. I think the worst thing is to stay and fight whatever comes. He who perseveres, wins. That's why I'm always here. You want to win, huh? -What? -What do you want to win? -Do you want to win the lottery? -Stop! I'm ticklish. -Did you say the lottery? -You're so deep. -You little jerk. -I am, right? I love it. Mom! Mom? Martina isn't here. She's gone. Come here. Come here. Will she come back? I don't know, honey. She can do what she likes. But aren't you girlfriends? Why do you ask that? She sleeps where Dad did. Maybe we could be an all-girl family! Maybe we could. But what do you think if you and I use our hands to stop us feeling sad? Shall we draw something? Great, go get your paints. You'll see. I didn't want to leave without saying anything. Look... I know we live in a world where everyone has an opinion and tells you the best way to live your life. -But you're doing really well. -I'm not so sure. I've been drugged for the last three years, not behaving like what I am. A cop. That's why when you showed me all that evidence, I wasn't capable of seeing it. Seeing what? Well, it's like you said. Someone about to kill himself doesn't buy tickets for The Rolling Stones. And they wouldn't ask their wife for a baby. So? So I don't think Oscar killed himself. For now it's only a hunch, but... I think I know where to start looking. Anyway, that's what I wanted to tell you. I need you to keep something a few days. I have to see someone and can't take it. I'm on my way. Oscar, it's Vicent. Did you call? I need you to come for your stuff. I can't keep it anymore. Subtitles by explosiveskull
