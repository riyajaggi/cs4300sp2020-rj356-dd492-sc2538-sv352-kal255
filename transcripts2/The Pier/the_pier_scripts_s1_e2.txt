 I've seen them, they were taking everything away from me, they took away everything, the keys of the car, the wallet with all the documents, my phone.. I couldn't even to call my wife.

 And I've seen me out of the sea, with wet underpants, wetting the car and... and I said: "Well.. the most logical thing.. is that you take a bath naked." Man, I think everything you've done it's pretty logical. What's going on? Come on, come on, get in! Go, go! Get in! Go! Let's go! He wants to go. Take him, take him. Give him to me, it's ok. We're home. Come on. Come on, let's go. Come here. Let's go. Do you live here? I'll go find you something. It's big, okay? I think it'll fit you. Good. And I found these that.. Well, I do not know if it's your number. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Thank you. Do you want a drink? A glass of milk for the hangover? I think it'll be good for you. Eh.. okay, milk. Excuse me, where can I...? Wherever you want. Make yourself at home. Do you know that the fridge on the porch can get very hot during the summer? Yes. It gets a little bit hot actually. It can get hot. But hey, so I can use this more. Do you mean the porch? Yes. Otherwise... we forget too many times what we have, right? I mean, you can have.. a lovely terrace or a garden and, in the end, you only use it twice a year and.. and if a friend comes to dinner. That's why I put the fridge out here. and I use this all the time, every time I want to have water or.. a glass of milk. I have all of this just for me. All this is here.. and nobody use it. So.. This is the nicest room of my house. Do you like it? Thank you. Alex. What happened? Have you told her? What? What do you mean what? Well, that you're Oscar's wife, that you know she was his lover, that because of her fucking whim you can neither cry nor feel your husband death.. I do not know, what we came here for. No? No, no I didn't. So, what have you talked about? He told me they have been.. eight years together. But I'm much better now. Let's go. Are you okay? Yes. Let's go. Well, she's a very attractive woman, she is.. she's sensual, she's.. sensual. But what's the point now, Alex? Nothing, what... I say that I understand that she would attract him physically. But that's not the point, darling. I can feel attraction for urbanization men or of the gym and yet, I don't have double or triple lives with any of them. Mom, what I mean is that I know Oscar was in love with me, okay? He was in love with me to the core, he loved me, I see you in the rearview, mom, I don't care what little faces you do, I know what I'm saying, and you will not make me doubt that, the other had to be a purely physical matter. You know? It can be. It could be. You know, Oscar was.. He was one of those men who needed to make love three or four times a day. You know? Well, such as... Michael Douglas, do you remember? Yes, it is an addiction like any other, there are clinical studies on that.. But he also made love to you, explain it to me, I don't understand it. I do not understand it. Well.. Maybe making love with me he didn't do with me everything he did with that lady, Katia, that's why I tell you, it was just sexual. In eight years. Alex. Alex, darling. I'm worried, you.. you don't answer the phone. I'm sorry, mom. Are you taking anxiolytics? What? No, no, it's caffeine pills. It's just that I need to concentrate. How many hours have you been without sleep? Eh... Twenty-two, I do not know. Is just that... I found the.. the password to Oscar's mail. I printed.. all his emails and his WhatsApp messages, look. Here are the ones who were sent with this woman and here, those who sent me. And here... I have put all the trips, plane tickets and so on, trips that we made together and here, what he did with her. With me he always went to cities and with her, to nature. You see that.. Óscar liked hiking and also diving. Come, Come and sit with me for a while, Come here. Mom, if you're going to tell me I'm obsessed, I know, really. It's that you are.. But I need answers. I know. There is a Greek philosopher, Socrates, or the sophists, I don't know, it starts with that, Anyway, what they say is that, when you have a problem, you have to search first in yourself. What is that, a yoga phrase or something like that? It means that when a problem hurts you a lot It's because is part of your interior. Mom, I don't understand, why are you telling me this? Really... Come here. I'm telling you because you're trying to decipher a marriage of 15 years labeling your husband as if he wes a sexual addict, looking for Whatsapp, tickets, photos.. and so you won't solve any problem. The problem, mom, the problem is that I need to understand because if I don't understand it, I can't assimilate it. Uh? Look at this, for example: March 23, 2017. "I just got to the airport and I just want to go back and get in bed with you. I miss you already. " That, Oscar.. to me. March 24, 2017, the next day: He's with her in Greece, look at his face. He is.. He's in love. But this photo is two weeks later with me. Look at his face. He's also in love, he's.. he has the same face. You know? Look at this. Today... This day was beautiful. Really. Please! What's going on? Run! Oh. Thank God.. you bought this ugly jersey. It's horrible, honey, but it suits me very well. I'll put it on right now. Why do you look at me like that? Ah. Ah. What happened? Oh, I've hit myself. Don't laugh, It does not hurt. It hurts. Really? It hurts me. Let's do one thing: Look here, look at my finger. I want you to bring all the pain here, to my finger. But concentrate. Okay? Get ready because it will disappear. "We've been about to make love in the car, as if we were two teenagers. " And she replies: "Ha, ha, ha." And ... and many smiley faces. And he says: "It was the same fuchsia bra that I do know, but It has come to me something animal towards her. " Who speaks to his lover like that of his wife, mother? Who? And who is that woman that allows him to talk to her about me? It's just ... I just do not understand, I only have questions and questions. Don't nod, mom, please. No pitching. What would you do? What would you do? What would I do? Well, I would search, until the last corner of the planet, every bloody message that was written. At the same time, I would start drinking in the morning, In the afternoon in the night, I would take hypnotics to sleep, anxiolytics in the morning, mixed with caffeine to wake me up, at 7 or 8 weeks I would already be taking Prozac not to get depressed and kill myself every morning, surely in 2 or 3 months I would be admitted in a psychiatric hospital, luxurious, yes, dear, \ N very luxurious! Darling. I'm going to shower. Good. I'm going to work and I'm going to live.. normal. Better than good. Can you collect this for me? Yes, of course. I'm going to the interview. I'm ready to attack, wish me luck. You don't need luck. Your work is awesome. Also your best friend works in that study. You are completely plugged in. You leave me much more calm. I'll go. No I love you. Bye. Good luck. "Fran, man, I can't go to the lunch with those of Hong Kong." "Oh no fuck. Why? Did something happen?" "No, no, nothing, nothing serious." "Something with Alex? "Nothing with Alex, you look like my grandmother, fuck. I'm not feeling well, that's it". " "Okay." I'll go eat with these. "I'll stick with Blu Tack sticks to fingers so as not to make a fool of yourself. Whatever God wants." "Thanks, man, I owe you one." Hello? Hello? Hello. Hello. Eh.. Nothing, I just came to.. to return your clothes. Thank you. I had a work meeting near here and.. and I say: "Well, then I'm going and I'll give them back". You have put softener. You don't have told your wife to iron my clothes. No, I ironed them. I mean, I iron a few times and the others, my wife. Do you want to have a must with me? It's about 25 years that I don't take a must. Well, it's time. Well, this house is a luxury, huh? A luxury, do you think? Yes, of course.. Well. It is a way of seeing it. Although, in reality, La Albufera was always the opposite of luxury. Is that so? They ate rats here. Did you eat rats here? In the 50s, I don't know ... There was.. a lot of misery. Rice.. and misery, as my grandfather used to say. The yayo.. He was always telling us stories. Can you tell me any? Do you want me to tell you one of my grandfather's stories? Yes, sure. A story of your grandfather, I don't know. Okay. Well, there was one that told us.. of women who pick the rice here, and then they were going to wash the clothes to one of the bends that there is in La Albufera. Do you know where the herons are now? I do not even know what a heron looks like. Well look, Do you see those curves that are there, as hidden? There, to the right. There. Well, there. Imagine the humidity here in August. The poor could not take it anymore and they bathed right there, in the bend. Sure. Some in underwear, petticoats .. or whatever they were wearing other nudes, and the town's teenagers they knew this. Sure. Man who did know. So they went there to see how they bathed and to make straws like crazy. And in one of these, that were there, dale that you hit the crank, Visillas goes into shock and starts screaming: "Stop, fuck, stop, that is my mother, fuck, is my mother! I need to go. Okay. Come whenever you want. I'm always here. What, we keep discussing or we solve this? Let everyone say one thing, please. Fermín. Come on, vote. Okay, well.. I want condoms. Really? You will remove a site to the machine to put condoms? Don't remove it. Put the condom in your wallet and in a couple of years you take it out because it will have expired and you'll put another one. Alejandra. Welcome, how are you? Good. You? Good. Don't stop, please. I mean it, I need routine, work and this. What are you talking about? We're deciding what to put in Vending machines. Ah. Perfect. Eh.. Your turn. Yes, I want natural smoothies without added sugar. Now there are only refreshments. Agree, yes. Bethlehem. Apples. If they can be Granny Smith I would appreciate it. A little apple? Who get apple out of a machine? In your life. Have you ever seen someone do that? Don't be.. Roberto. Also apples, but there are also branded apples.. Katia. Let's go. Alex, what is this? I don't know, you tell me. Basketball, bike, fishing.. Do you think Óscar, apart from being the ideal husband and a great lover for this lady from La Albufera, I have no doubt, do you think that could also be the perfect father? Don't say nonsense, please. Who have pictures of a little girl on the phone if he's not the father? She can be that woman's daughter, only hers. They have been together 8 years, and this girl is no more than 8. She could have another husband, a lover, a niece.. And Óscar took photos of her niece on his cell phone? Eh? I don't know, Alex, I don't know! But look at her, look at her jaw. Look at her eyes! It's just like Óscar. Now it's enough! Here nobody has the jaw nor the eyes of anyone. You've gone to see that lady and you've left without telling her who you were and you've gone back to work, right? I thought you would leave the pot with the subject of the ashes, but here you are, here you are. So you're going to listen to me just for a moment and you're going to do what I say: You're going to take these pictures and you're going to throw them away, and you're going to move on. You will continue with your life, you alone, I'm here with you, but you alone. Okay? Yes Kati.. "Come in, Arturo." Shit, shit.. What's wrong? We have a meeting with the "big boss" in one hour and here there is a prison. Why? I just looked away and we know what that means. What does it mean? That is going to get it folded. But why? If we just sell the most expensive building from this site. That's right. Look, I know it is insensitive what I'm going to tell you, but listen to me. Yes. Are you ready to continue with our life? Yes, yes. Yes. Are you sure? Yes. Because we worked on this project for seven years and we have to take it to the end. Katia.. I need to work. It's good for me. So.. right now you and I will enter that meeting and we are going to turn it around. Hurry, I'll wait for you there. Oh, look. Hello! Hello! Blanca! What a joy! You're gorgeous.   Oh, thanks. You too.   Look, this is Paul. Hello. Nice to meet you. You too. "We have read your novel and we have discussed it" It's on the line   of your previous jobs. Thanks. But.. We believe that it doesn't fit   to the current market trend. Aha. But you are   my editors, you are the ones who tell me   when I have to publish and what. Yes, sure, sure. But the reader now looks for   something more emotional, in the line of leading novelists,   like Milena Busquets, Yasmina Reza..   Uh, wonderful novelists. Wonderful. But, you know, the leading novelists   can come and go, the same as the trends,   like the tide, they come and go.   Blanca.. I value your vision of reality. But if you don't want young   talents to get you on the car, You have to make an effort   and move forward with the times. Move forward with the times..   Move forward with the times.. But do you think writers   with concerns always want to write the same thing?   You are the publishers that ask us always the same novel. Or not? When you see success,   you want to clone it and clone, in a movie,   on a TV movie, in a series, in a novel..   to destroy it. Do you have something else? Of course I have.  I have had something else for two years. Well good, good. Tell us. Well, I have the story of.. a woman, a woman.. young, professional, strong, whose life is devastated   in ten seconds when she sees her husband   dead on a stretcher. And the problem it's not that  he committed suicide, no, no, that doesn't even hurt, she doesn't even have the strength   to feel pain with all that, there's another very strong reason, and the reason is another woman, another house, another life that he has lengthened   for eight years. This looks like a TV movie, right? We could see it   on a Saturday afternoon at home, but it's not like that,   because that other woman It is an untamable force   of nature. I do not know why I came   today too. I... I like to chat with you   and the landscape and.. I guess it relaxes me. It's like I'm watching   a movie. Well I'll have to start  charging you for the visits, and for the must too.   Of course. You want? No, I don't smoke. Okay. Veronica? Call Conrado. What?   Call the Civil Guard. But what do I tell them?  What are we doing? What's going on? Veronica, I don't know what we are..   Chis! Shut up. Get out. I said get out. I told you to get out! I'm going, okay, okay now. Let's go. Lie down. Get on the ground! Lie face down, now.   I haven't done anything. Oscar. What?   Point. Why are you here? Are you okay? Let's go.   Let's go live to.. to Frankfurt. To Frankfurt? Now Germany is fashionable. Let's go.   To Germany. What about our friends.. and the sun and the sea..?   I just want to be with you. I just want to be with you,   I don't care about the rest. But what are you saying, love?  You don't want to leave. You don't want to go to Germany, are you crazy? Hello. Hello, is there anybody? Arturo Meyer belongs to the new   generation of architects. He graduated Magna Cum Laude in the technical school   of Zurich Architecture and is a specialist   in large buildings and in managing large sums.  We are very lucky to have a talent like him in this studio.   Marvelous. Oh no, no, please, don't say that. I have been studying   your projects and I've seen the design   that you and Alejandra did. I must congratulate you.   Thank you very much. Well, since you know about us,   tell us something about yourself. The tallest building   you worked on? Well.. in Panama,   a 17-story tower. Wow. And did not you get vertigo? Come on, it's crystal clear   that what Arthur comes to do is to take care of the budget,   the paperwork management.. what is to lift the building, Of course, it will continue in your hands   and in Alejandra's. Yes, the thing is that you   concentrate on your work and I'll discuss   with politicians, investors and the budget issue. You talk a lot about budget. Is there any problem with it?   What offer did you make? Investors don't cover   the total cost of the project. It's funny: The building costs   311 million euros, and investors   have signed for 336 million. So, even if there is an extra cost, and in our study   we never went over budget, There are a few million left over. What pocket do they go to? I'd like to know   who we're going to corrupt and why, you know, just to know it. Arturo, would you excuse us a second,   please? Katia. Yes, sure. Where did you get that number? From the delegate of Such & Trust,   your British partner. Have you fucked the investment partner? No, actually he has fucked me. You are not jealous, are you? You make love with your wife   and we have never had problems. It is not the same.   No? No, it's not the same.   It's not the same. No.   Explain it to me. You're fucking a guy   the whole business depends on and you're putting everything at risk.   I didn't put anything at risk, I just had a bonk. So if you want to be jealous   incongruous, stupid and absurd   you should really stop it. I'm not jealous.   No? I'm not. It has nothing to do   the professional or the personal, I don't mix them. Listen..   Listen to me, Jaume: That skyscraper is Alejandra's,  Alejandra's! So if you have brought me this fucking Magna Cum Laude   of my ass to atone, to sneer or to try   to convince someone that something   of the project has to change, you are going to have it very fucked up. Very fucked up.. because I will not allow it. "Tell me."   Alex, where are you? "I had to go."   I know, but where did you go? "To find out things." You have to come here now. Something is happening   and I need you by my side now. "Tell them I had to go. I'm a widow, Katia.. ".   It's not that, fuck, They're screwing with us. "I have important things to do" How are you? I'm so sorry darling. Hello. Hi. What's up, Llum? Hey, Vero, how are you, honey?   Good. Oh, you're so strong. Fuck! Damn it. Have you seen it? Are you okay? All right? Careful, careful. Fuck, you're bleeding. Oh, forgive me, forgive me.   I have miscalculated. I'm so sorry.  Put this here. You are.. Martina aren't you? Martina. Veronica. Veronica, yes. Forgive me, really.   No, don't worry, nothing happened. Ouch.   Why don't you come home and we treat the wound? Can you drive? No, no. I don't think so. No problem, come on. Bring your things and let's go. Alex. Alex. Honey? You are not from around here, right? No. I'm a biologist. Ah. I'm doing a study   of the birds in the area. How nice. And what birds do you study? Ducks, Starlings.. everything. Well here, there are a lot of ducks. Well, I mean, we have them. Are you better? I'm talking about your husband. No, he wasn't my husband. He was married. Eight years. Wasn't it painful for you   him having another life? Has ever happened to you, to.. to really love someone.. and the only thing you want  is for him to be happy? And.. And everything that makes him happy,   well.. It makes you happy too. Hey, if you want..   I'll wash your blouse in a moment. Thank you.   You can't go like this, blood stained,   to study the ducks. Here it dries up in a moment. I'll bring it to you. What are you doing? But hey,   are you painting my nail? Come on, come on! Fuck. What's happening? Can I help you? Wait. The water is coming out of the washing machine I don't know why. Yes, thank you.   Pull. Come on. A little bit more. The other side, one.. two, three. There isn't. There isn't. There isn't. What's missing? The rubber tube. Hey, honey. Hi, mommy. Hello, my love. What happened? Well, nothing.. the water has come out of.. of the washing machine, you see   it's all on the floor. Hello. You have.. a wound. Do you know what happened? We had a   clash with the car, but it's been nothing. My love. Come on, I'll make you   a snack, okay? I'm coming. Does it hurt? A little bit. Come here, I'll cure you. Here. Let's see, you have to bring all the pain here, to my finger. Are you ready? Concentrate. Close your eyes. So? Did it stop hurting? Yes. It hasn't stopped hurting,   you're crying. Mom, can we call dad   to heal her? It does not work with me. Dad is.. working, darling. He's traveling.   And when will he come back? Well..   Do you know that.. that I study birds?   Oh, yes? And there are very nice ones around here,   near your house. In fact... I'm going to.. come and live here, I'm looking for a house for me. Well, you do not need   to keep looking. We have   a room upstairs. We can rent it if you want. [CAMI] :)
