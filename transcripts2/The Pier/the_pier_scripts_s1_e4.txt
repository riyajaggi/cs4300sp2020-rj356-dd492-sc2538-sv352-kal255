 I didn't come here to argue. Do you want to go running with me? I have a hangover.. No. Alex. Come on, I promise that next time I see husbands with a dog and unknown ladies, I promise to warn you. I promise to warn. I'm sorry. You think I'm the worst friend in the world. Well sometimes.. yes.. Not always,

 but I'm the only one you have, so.. you have to reconcile with me. Eh? I went out last night. But not to the Abufera. I went to a bar. Aha. And I hooked up with a man. What? Occasional sex, the one you like. Are you serious? Honey, you have to tell me everything, now. It was a little crazy. I was there alone, we just had a word and three shots later.. "I took it to the bathroom."

 You know, the situation.. I don't know, that.. that they could.. "find us, that they could ear us from the bathroom doors.." And he.. that. Did he go down on you? Well.. Into the bathroom? And how was it? Good. Then I saw my panties "on the floor and.." What happened to the panties? They were on the floor of a public bathroom, and.. I realized it and we stopped. "Wait a moment." A man is going down on you.. Lower your voice. Sorry. A man is going down on you in the bathroom, And you tell him to stop for the panties? " I don't understand. Well he understood it perfectly. Then we went for a drink and we chatted. He seemed like a very good guy. He told me that he lived half year in Amsterdam, that works.. Typical chat that one has: "We're almost going to fuck, but now stop it because my panties fell to the ground and they are going to get dirty". And what's wrong? Well, it's all wrong, Alex. If you're going to fuck with strangers, there are some rules. Sorry for not having read the manual 'how to have lovers'. I really don't know why I tell you anything. Do you know why I don't have a husband? Because I love my life, my freedom, and.. to be able to make my decisions, spend the weekends with my friend.. with no more bond than ours, No problems, no arguments, no worries. "But who is free?" "We are all prisoners of our fears, of our past and our arbitrary concepts of good and evil." "Freedom collides against reality constantly, like the spheres of Newton's pendulum, and that's what Orlando was going to realize one afternoon of spring, " "that freedom and fear live on the same landing." Hello, Llum. Hello! Veronica is here? She's over there. Until now. Bye. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? Well, I'm very interested in knowing how rice is grown. Is that so? Yes. Since when? Well since.. Do you want me to explain it to you? Yes. Okay. Look.. This is the rice with the skin. Being in the water, it germinates and the root comes out. This is the root. Now it has a little mud, but that is the root. Is this rice? Aha. This part. I'll show you a place. Come. To me this smell is the one I like the most. Have you ever made love at work? No. At your wife's work.. either? I'm pregnant. "Happiness always lives there, next to the guilt, next to the danger, next to the fear." Hi. Hi, Martina. Hello.. Do you want a juice? Yeah I know, it's all messed up. With the washing machine problem A lot of things piled up, you know? Thank God Vicent has come to help us out. I haven't introduced you, right? Look, Vicent, this is Martina. Room mate. Pleasure meeting you. What's up? Hey, well maybe he can help you with yours too. With mine? What is mine? You know. Vicent is a boatman. He walks the tourists and shows them the birds that are in the Abufera. He knows all the species that exist in the area. Martina is a biologist, you know? She has come to do a study of birds, right? Something like that. And what birds are studying? A little of everything. Right now I'm.. very focused on the gray heron, the black starling and the duck havelda clangula. Well, I'm trying because with the change of season, thousands of them leave in flock1n because they don't have offspring and they don't have to constantly return to the nest.. Anyway, the deterioration of the environment is causing a lot of species to stop nesting. Ok. Thanks for the juice. Are you leaving? Yes. I'll see you tomorrow. Behave yourself. Sure. Hey, sorry I came in like this, without warning. Next time I'll call you before. And why would you do that? Because I came in.. I'm going to say nonsense, but.. I entered and I saw that the bed was unmade and.. Yes? And I thought: "They have slept together", and.. Well, we slept together, yes. What? We slept together. Ah. Well, that, I interrupted a moment of intimacy and I shouldn't have done it. You haven't interrupt anything. Don't worry. I think it's a little.. weird. Why? Because you're like this, so hurt by the loss of Óscar and, suddenly, you sleep with.. I don't know.. Well, I know you say, that a good fuck can fix a bad day, but.. I don't know It seems like.. Look, Martina, that one thing has nothing to do with the other. Ah. Vicent and I are.. We're friends since we were kids. We've always slept together. We understand each other like that, is something.. natural, It.. It's just it, nothing more. And since when do you sleep together? Well I told you, all of our lives. In other words, you cheated on Oscar. No. I've never cheated on anyone. Well, then, what was it? An allowed fuck? Well yes, an allowed fuck. More or less. More or less. I just don't know what more or less means. Hey what's wrong with you? Why are you like this? I don't.. Are you okay? Yes. No, no, yes.. Look, don't listen to me because I'm saying nonsense. After all, you knew about his wife, so.. Nothing.. It's just that it's me that.. I have trouble understanding these things but.. Don't listen to me. Look, Martina, I have never cheated on anyone. And of course Oscar knew everything. At the beginning, well, He also had problems to understand, but then.. He sometime even stayed with us. Yes. Well.. I'm going to pick up Sol from school. I don't want her to come here alone. Sure. Are you okay? Of course I am. I really am. Are you sure? Yes. Okay. I'll see you later. See you. Who are they? Let's see.. What is this? Oscar's papers. It's just that I've been looking and I saw that there are very, very strange money movements. Look, for example, 1.2 million, 15 thousands.. all coming from different places. Look here. Cayman Islands, here Panama.. They're tax havens. These numbers are strange, I have never seen that money in my life. What are you looking for, Mrs. Leiva? Numbers. I'm looking for numbers, because this is.. Mrs.Leiva, What are you looking for exactly? I am.. I'm trying to understand who my husband was. Because, this one.. at this point, as you can see, I I don't really know if he was.. if he was the man with whom I.. I shared my mortgage and that was the love of my life, but that I, clearly, wasn't the love of his life, because he lived in the Albufera with a woman and her daughter, and he lived in flip flops. And now, I think he was whitening money for Casteleure? Casteleiro? Casteleiro SLU. And above all on Friday nights, he had threesomes with a boatman. He smoked weed, he liked marijuana, He.. he.. He seemed.. Mrs. Leiva, calm down. It's just.. I think you're having.. a panic attack. No, I'm fine, if that is what happens.. well, even if we went to nude beaches. Sit down, please. It's a little hot in here, isn't it? Try breathing, please. I'm fine, it's just that.. When.. when I wear the glasses I.. get dizzy and.. Drink some water. Yes, thank you. Try to breathe, Mrs. Leiva. It's a little bit hot. The.. the.. the joints.. the girl.. Try to breathe. Don't worry. The.. "Concentrate on breathing." "The joints.." Mrs. Leiva, look me in the eyes. What color are my eyes? What color are my eyes? Br.. Brown. Brown. And now, try to breathe. Slow down. "Don't worry." "Yes." Look at me. Are you taking pills? No. Are you sure? Yes. Good. Well now let's go to therapy we're going to ask the psychiatrist to prescribe you something. No no. It's just.. I don't want to take anything. Because I need to be focused. I need to know what happened and.. and if I have to be blamed for something, well.. it'll hurt. But I need that it'll hurt. "For me, the guilt is.." the guilt is that that stays there, floating, after a suicide. I felt that too. And.. I started to point at a paper trying to find all the reasons that I could think of to.. to feel guilty for the death of my wife. The guilt of having married a woman far above my possibilities, the guilt of.. of have been waiting for years to get tired of other guys hurting her... asking her to marry them.. the guilt of having allowed her to go out and have fun to enjoy life while I was on duty. so that she could be the whore that goes out without her husband, let her be the talk of all the people, in the domino, in every circle.. And I, the civil guard who did nothing when.. when they raped her at the exit of the Margarita festival. Nobody believed her. Not even the judge. And I thought: "What if they're right?" And I didn't do anything. I let people talk, smashing the face of someone, "That was pain." And I was unable to.. to give her a new life, unable to.. to ask for the transfer. And she ended up hanging in the garage. And I spent three years.. three years to understand that only the suicide victims are responsible for their own death. Thank you, Conrado. Well, we're done for today. Thank you all. Can we go? Can you wait for me at the bar below? I need to speak with the therapist. Actually I have to go back to the studio. Another day? Okay. How are you, Conrado? You have spoken very well. Yes, I feel better. I feel good. In fact, I was thinking about starting to stop my medication. Montse, I've lived with this for three years, and I think I got through it, so I think it's time to start living again, one step at a time. I.. I think you should continue for a few months more. Yes, Montse, but I want to do it, I need to do it, to face reality with its pain, with what it takes. Well, if you feel ready, let's try it. "You have to reduce the dose little by little." Take off a quarter for the first two months. and let's see how it's going okay? A guy gets out, all dressed, with his shoes, and says: "I'm the 'conseller'." He starts asking me questions, and other questions and other questions and, in the end, the man goes and says: "What I think is that a maritime unit is needed here." He says: "Maritime unit? Do we have a maritime unit?" I say: "Look." And there was the Vicent. Well, I've got Veronica pregnant. What are you going to do? I don't know, we haven't talked about it yet. Well, a child changes everything, Oscar. I know, I keep thinking about it. And will change her. Completely, come on. I know. I've been thinking a lot about this and I think I know why. Women have only one ovule per month, and we have millions of sperms, It's so fucking weird. Weird? Why? Because you don't have the same appreciation of something if you only have one and you know it's over. What the fuck are you talking about Vicent? We can't have the same sense of fatherhood than them, guys. How many times can a woman get pregnant? A few. Yes. What about us? How many women can we get pregnant? Infinite. Please, excuse me. What's up, Oscar, man? Did you miss me or what? "I've got Veronica pregnant, Fran." Hey man, come on. Congratulations. I'm really happy. Congratulations. How are you? Good. Well, a child changes everything, Fran. Well, of course, man. It was time to change it, right? Don't you think? Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I think so. Oscar, look at me. Look at me man. Alex will be fine, okay? And you will live with who you want, with Veronica, who is wonderful, and you're going to have a son, man, and that's a fucking wonderful. Yes. He's going to piss on you, he's going to shit on you, you're not going to sleep for the rest of your fucking life.. But that's fucking wonderful. Everything is fine. Okay? This is a fucking neon on the way, man. It really is. "Hello, Martina. We will make a tribute to Oscar, and I wish you could come. Kisses." You have four new messages. Oscar.. Óscar, I'm Vicent. Have you called me? Where have you been all morning? In the bank, they have kept me for two hours. you know.. Are you okay? Yes, you? How's going on here? Is there something new? Yes, there are some news, I don't know which, but there are. What happened? Big Boss is weird, I can tell. He doesn't seem like the other times. That gesture, that smile.. I tell you there's something going on. I'm going to find out. No, of a single block. Can I call you later? What happened? And don't tell me anything, because I know that smile and gesture are not normal. I left my wife. Why? Because we were not good. I don't know, I thought about it for a while, and after what happened to \ Alejandra, well.. It became pretty clear. -Seems like Oscar's death was a revealing for all. Do you think it's time to become impertinent? I'm sorry. Frankly, I wasn't expecting to be happy, but... "How are you? Do you need help?" What is said between colleagues, right? I'm sorry. How are you? Well.. Very good. One more thing.. You leaving your wife changes your relationship with me? It depends. Does it? No, I think it's good like this. "Sometimes, good news fall into our lives, with the same strength as the Hiroshima bomb, with an effect so devastating that it is difficult to recover " "This was the news of my pregnancy for my marriage." "That was the only time in our lives in which Orlando and I felt that the world was with us." Do you think Oscar had a child with Verónica because Alex didn't want to have it? Well, frankly, no. So? Then, I'll give you good news, my love. Do you know the only thing that men want in this life? Pollinate, their women, their lovers.. everyone. Pollinate, pollinate and pollinate. Blanca, don't be old. Nowadays there are men who really care for their children, they love them, they educate them.. Because they have to. They have to water them because their women are always ready to fight. Where does that remorse come from? Remorse? It's not remorse. That are statistics. Do you know how many women are being cheated on at this moment, in the world? The most part. Your mother, my daughter and I, of course, we could be the protagonists of this novel. You got over very well what happened to you 25 years ago. Get over? Nobody talks about getting over. We're in a fight. Look, I would find the novel much more interesting if you were talking about a man who really loves two people. Until the madness. "Until the madness." Until the madness. Ha, well, it's not bad. Until the madness. Hey, Adita, What would you say if I invited you to collaborate with me in my novel and will you pay 10% of our earnings? Well.. How much would it be? Would it reach 4,000 euros more or less? Why do you want 4000 euros? For a trip. A trip? I want to bring someone to New York. Someone ... older? I'll tell you. Okay. But don't let him pollinate you. Let's see, "The first time that Orlando thought about the idea of ​​being a father, He said yes and his wife said no." "A year later, at the same crossroads, Orlando lost his mind, he understood that if in 2000 years we couldn't take away the weight of the Judeo-Christian guilt ", "How was he going to take it off in 50 fucking weeks next to his lover?" # Siempre quise ir a L.A. # Dejar un día esta ciudad. # Cruzar el mar en tu compañía. # Pero ya hace tiempo que me has dejado # y probablemente me habrás olvidado. # No sé qué aventuras correré sin ti. # Y ahora estoy aquí sentado, # en un viejo Cadillac, segunda mano. # junto al Mervellé, y a mis pies, mi ciudad. # Y hace un momento que me ha dejado... # "I've been thinking about it about the child and.. " "Aha " And, well, I don't know, we should.. talk about it, right? Or.. or take some decision, maybe it's not.. It is not the ideal situation to have a child. Situation? And what situation is that? That of being born of an act of love so deep, like the one you and I have? Eh? No, come on. I mean, I am not here all the time and.. and between trips and work.. But we already knew that. I don't mean that. I mean, with a child it's.. is different. It changes everything. A child needs a father. And? A son completely change your life you can't even imagine, my love. Let him change us, it doesn't matter to me. Yeah, fuck, but I do. "What's wrong?" What's wrong, Óscar? Are you okay? Alejandra got pregnant a year ago. And I thought that it would be the solution to all this. That it was going to fix it, that it was a signal to stay there definitely and never come here again. But she aborted. And since then, I feel like shit. A son of a bitch unable to decide if he wants to stay there or.. or stay here or.. I don't want to hurt her.. and I don't want to hurt you either. I'm very sorry, but I can't have a child with you. I'm sorry, I can't. Do we throw the flowers? Put these. This is the last one. "From the wild, the absolutely savage we can not flee." "At least not us, those who have grown up in this lagoon, those who were born between shotguns and who learned to drive boats before riding a bike, the grandchildren of those who could only eat rats during the War, those that know that eels, if you don't leave them for two weeks in clear water, taste like the ground" Since when? Eight weeks. Have you done any tests, analysis or something? Of course. Two. So, are you..? I'm pregnant. And how couldn't you tell me, my love? When could I tell you? If you don't stop from traveling lately. And I needed to digest it to.. Listen. ..to be able to tell it. All that's over. All that is over, honey. No more meals outside, on weekends, the trips. all of that. No. "Listen to me please". I'll stay. Here. Always. My love, listen to me. I'm not going to be. I'll start the tower of Shanghai. But who cares about Shanghai? To me. That is not imp.. We're having a child. We talk about having a child, love. Yes, it's important. For me it is very important. It's a very important moment in my career. You go four days a week to Frankfort, I'm going to China for 11 months. We'll have it later. Or we can throw it all away and start from scratch. It's just.. Well, we started from scratch, my love, it's okay. How are we going to have it now? It's that ... Later.. Eh? Shanghai is not so cool. You can build here or in Castellón or .. or in Benicassim. Very good, you've drunk it all. Give Martina a kiss. Good night Martina. Let's go. Verónica... Óscar. I'm here. And this child is going to be with me. And if you can't realize that it already exists, it's okay. I'm not going to ask you for anything, I never did. But I can. I already love him. And this doesn't have to be part of your life, if you don't want to. Nor your feelings of guilt with your wife.. nor about the life of that other child who wasn't born, Óscar. "He is, simply, a person who is on the way." So.. you can prepare to meet him, if you want. Look, this has arrived. Tomorrow they open Oscar's testament. And I keep thinking that tomorrow... Óscar 's wife will find out from a notary that her husband has a daughter. This situation is crap. Yes, it's crap. It's just.. This is not fair, Martina. I can not let it happen. And what do you want to do? I don't know. Call her, send her an email..? Send her an "e-mail"? I don't know. Are you kidding? And what can I put in the "subject"? something like.. "I fucked your husband" or ... "Look, I have a daughter with him"? No. What I have to do is.. is going to talk to her. That's what I have to do. I.. well.. I, I think that notaries are there for that, You know? They charge you, not just to sign a paper, they're there to.. to solve This kind of situation, you know? Put yourself in her shoes. You're going to hear your husband's will, alone, fucked up, and suddenly, a man in a suit you've never seen, tells you that your husband had another life, and that's not it, Martina, because he has a daughter. What...? What will you do if.. if you need to scream or ... or if you need to cry, and you're there, in front of a man who.. who you don't know at all? What.. What would you do? Would you.. hug him? Fuck. I can't let it happen. She should be alone. So I have to go myself.. and tell her directly. I'm going to look for Oscar's ID. There has to be the address. Veronica told me that she will come to my house tomorrow to tell me everything about Óscar. I know.. I've been going to the Albufera, but then.. You're loosing control. Don't you see that this is a fucking insanity, that you are not living your life, honey? But what life, Katia? If all my life is a lie. I don't.. I don't have a real life. I don't have it, I've never had it. "It's a fucking madness, but, but when Veronica'll come to   you she'll discover everything and that's it. No, you don't understand.   Yes I do understand. You're completely loosing control. Óscar was fired   five years ago, right? Well, every month   money continued to enter in.. in tax havens. What was he doing?   I don't know. It's what I'm trying to find out, and there's a man, in the Abufera,   a.. a boatman, his best friend,   with whom he made threesomes.. Well, that's another story. But the important thing is that I think that   man is involved in his death. Listen to me. Wait. "Oscar, I'm Vicent.   Have you called me?" "Hey, I need you to come   to take your thing, I can't keep it longer. " What was he keeping? I don't know   but I need to find out, and the only way is for that woman   to still not know who I am. Okay, Alex, what are you going to do? I need you to go pretend to be me  when she comes to my house. What? Do you realize   what are you asking me? Please. I can't do something like that.   Yes you can. Álex..   Do it for me, Katia. Ask me whatever you want, Alex,   whatever you want, but I'm not going to do that.   I need.. I can't.   Come on, please. I'm asking you please, honey.   Alex. Please. "Are you okay?"  Yes, I'm already in Santo Domingo. In a couple of hours   I'll take the ferry to Panama. So in two days   you'll have the money, okay? [CAMI] :)
