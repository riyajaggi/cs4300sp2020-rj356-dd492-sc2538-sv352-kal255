Did I wake you? Not at all. I'm awake here, at the station. I was drawing until 3 am. I can't sleep. I can't think about anything else.

 -Do you really think Oscar was murdered? -It's just a hunch. Still just a feeling, but it's been a while since I had one. But first off, I need to get everything in order. I'll question the neighbors again, go over the evidence. Can I do anything, in the meantime? Help in any way? This is my job, Mrs. Leyva. I promise to let you know if there's any news. I'd tell you to go back to sleep, but I think you're like me. We could stay up talking on the phone for two hours, but it's better you try to relax and distract yourself with your drawing, and, most importantly, be discreet about this. It's the only way you can help me. Damn you can run, huh? Come on, listen. I'm the other woman,

 the home wrecker, and you're the crazy bird lady, so to each their own. You sabotage 336 million projects and I encourage you. Fuck Snatch and Trust. You and I are going to be chilled, so that's that. If you want someone to go down on you in the bathroom at happy hour, I'll get a mop and clean the floor for you. That way you won't mind taking off your panties. I actually have an idea. -For what? -The building. -Okay. -Sketches. -Sketches are good. -30 of them. Stop. I've been following you since Malvarosa and I can't keep going. Good Lord. -30 sketches? -Yes. -Shall we go? -Let's. The building is supported by a concrete and steel core, and the floors would come off it. They're like rings. Each is a different size, making the building twist around itself. It would be like a helix. It's alive, organic. It could even remind you of a pagoda, maybe. I don't know. I calculated it with 23 different types of window. The curved glass would be the most difficult and expensive part, but I'm sure we could do it. The most interesting thing, though, is that we would plant a forest on the roof. 2500 m3 of earth. I still don't know how many tons of CO2 it'd absorb, but what would be unique is having a vertical forest in the heart of the city. An Eco-friendly, organic, dynamic building. Unadulterated life. Do you like it? -Yes. -Come on! You know we're the worst runners in Valencia, right? Since when do you sunbathe topless? Since now? I just started. Damn. Well, I won't be the party pooper. There. What a buzz. -Verónica! -Goodness me. Where have you been? You're soaked. -Yeah, well... I've been fired. -Oh, no. Apparently I wasn't meeting the standards of the business' expectations and something else really important, I only went to Frankfurt eight times in two years. So you decided to celebrate taking a swim in your suit? -Yes! -Great. -Did you come in your car? -Yes! -So the seats are also soaking? -Soaking and covered in sand. -Fabulous. -Where's my girl? So what are you thinking now? I don't have the slightest clue. But I'm very happy. -I'm glad you're happy? -You are? -Yes. -I'm happy! There we go. I've spent half my life worrying about what's going to happen, what's coming, what's next, and I forgot about what's most important. -And what is that? -Well, this. Living in the moment. Everything that happens while I'm thinking about share values. Why do I care if the price of soya rises or falls in Argentina? I don't know. What I want to think about is Sol. I don't want to miss her growing up. And about you, hanging out the laundry. -Hanging out the laundry? Great. -Noticing how your neck tastes of salt. Oscar... It looks like we'll have to continue this later. I've made plans with the girls. -Hey! -Afternoon. How are you? How's it going, ladies? -You know how it is. -Leave her alone, you stud. -Give me that. -Look at his ass. I was going to leave her with Vicent, but seeing as you're here... -I'll stay with her. I'd love to. -Are you sure? -Come on then! -I'm coming. Shots, shots, shots! Have fun and drink to my health, a lot! Celebrate me being fired. Toast to the unemployed guy. Fancy a run? It's noon, you can't run in this heat, Mom. Thank goodness. You have no idea how stupid I feel in these leggings. You've got white wine, right? Delicious. You have such nice wine. Thank you. Is that all you have to say? Acting like nothing happened? I'm aware I was a bad mother, but your father's cheating destroyed me. I needed to get on with my life and you were the one who suffered. I was selfish. Extremely selfish. That's the first time you've been honest. Beautiful. I didn't give you the love you needed. And maybe that made you lean on... -I don't know, those happy memories. -Excuse me? I'm just saying that maybe it made you stop paying attention. Hang on... -Paying attention? -Well, yes. To the fact your husband had a lover and... Mom, are you really blaming me for Oscar having an affair? No, baby. I'm not blaming you at all. I'm not. But you didn't notice that and a few other things. -What other things, Mom? -Well... He was going to a strip club. When I was sorting boxes the other day, I found a diary where the good ol' douche wrote he went to a club every Wednesday. Here it is: The Lula Club, Kilometer 38, Sueca Highway. Not exactly a tennis club. One of the things you never want to hear from your mom is that your husband goes to brothels. The idea of him in one of those places overwhelms me. Apparently neither I nor Verónica were enough for him, so... I don't know what he wanted there. But what I really don't know anymore is how many more of Oscar's secrets I can actually take. Good afternoon. -Look who's here! -Look at her. -She just fell asleep. -She's such a beautiful little thing. -There you go. -Look at her. Could you warm this for 30 seconds, Tino? No more, no less. I'll charge you for the electricity. How come you're still with this old grump, Maru? -He's a great dancer. -You've never danced for me. She's the only one I managed to convince. Get me a beer. Hey, Vicent. How are the eels? -I haven't been fishing. -Why not? My eel trap got caught in some reeds. -I've been fixing it for two days now. -Oh, man. This little girl smells bad, you know. -I changed her just before we left. -Relax! -Uncle Vicent is here. -Will you change her? Yes. There, there, my love. -Here, take this. -Uncle Vicent will change you. -Help Uncle Vicent, Maru. -Heavens, what a stink. -She's still asleep. -I'll help, I don't trust him. Is there a little gift for Uncle Vicent? The same again, Tino. -And I'll get Oscar's too. -I'll bring it over. -Bring me some shrimp too. -Thanks very much, Andrés. I should thank you. I listened to your investment advice and almost doubled my money. That's great. A little bit of luck and intuition. Look, I'll get to the point. I want you to come work for me. I have some bars, clubs and other premises. I have a small hotel. I'll make you a business offer and you decide the conditions. -Seriously? -Yes, man. Well, my only condition is that it's here in La Albufera. Damn, if that's all you're asking for... What will I be doing? The accounting? Great. Well, well... The hell's angel rises from the ashes. You haven't ridden for a long time. I know. It's been a long time since I did a lot of things. I wanted to talk to you. About Oscar. -What about him? -Well, you know how I am. When something doesn't add up, I can't switch off. It goes round and round my head and... I don't know, maybe the first time I asked you you didn't understand or thought it wasn't important. The voicemail you left him a few hours before he died. What did you want him to urgently pick up? What voicemail? "Oscar, it's Vicent. Did you call? I need you to come for your stuff." I can't keep it anymore. What were you keeping? I already told you. We went fishing the day before. He left his rod and tackle here. I wanted to give them back. I'm not a storage unit. Okay. In that case, that's all. You tell me, "I don't want to look after a fishing rod that isn't mine. It's a dangerous tool, the hook could rip one of my balls off." And the stupid cop gets on his bike and rides away eating dust. The thing is, I keep going over it in my mind... What if it's different? What if I'm the one who rips your balls off and you're the one who eats dust? This is what we have to do. It has dynamic, moving curves. The symmetry looks like it's balancing itself. It's organic. Not that straight up and down shit. Oh, no. Not that one. Here are the sketches in pencil. I get you're annoyed we didn't come to the meeting, I'm sorry. But seriously, this is much better. For the next five minutes I don't care about the building. We're both here talking like we're just colleagues. We haven't been like that for four years. Three and a half. Three and a half years that we've slept, laughed and made plans together. You said it was great I'd left my wife, that nothing had changed, but now you won't return my calls. We don't talk anymore. So everything has changed. I just realized how many lies we'd told. And the damage we did. I see it in Alex. I can't go on like that. Like what? I left my wife, dammit. I did it because I'm in love with you. We had a wonderful love story. Amazing. But I destroyed your marriage. I ruined someone else's life, when they never did anything to me. I can't build anything on those ruins. I just can't. We'll start from scratch. We can do that. We already started from less than scratch. Dinners in the suburbs, Thursday nights in boutique hotels, weekends we stole from your wife. Don't you see? We both deserve a beautiful love story. A new start. A new story. We have to end this. We've all been to Asia. We all know it. Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, right? And we've all seen the same straight up and down buildings. Course lifelessness. Straight lines are of the past. The world is moving and that's what I'm offering to you: change, curves. The same enormous structure, with windows embedded in its skin. Where its inhabitants can virtually lie in the void. And on top? A forest on the roof. This has never been done, ladies and gentlemen. We've come this far with an amazing project, but sooner or later clairvoyance comes into play. And it's just come to my architects now. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the past. This is the future. He was in his office for 35 minutes. I thought he was writing up our dismissal, but he was sketching. He sketched it with the photos I showed him, called the investors, they came back and he sold them on it. They've invested. We have two months to redesign the project. -The strip club is on the left. -Where are you? At a strip joint off the freeway with my mom. -I'll explain later. -A strip club? Okay, talk later. Okay, bye. -Are you sure you want to go in? -Yes. -Did you want something? -A bitter lemon. -We don't have any. -What do you have? -Spirits, shots... -A shot of Sambuca, then. I'd like a white wine in a tall glass with lots of ice, please. Listen, girls, this is a brothel. -I think you're in the wrong place. -Not at all. I'm a hooker, I want to work here. I'm alright for now. Tell me, what is your name? -Amelia. -Amelia, how long have you worked here? -Four years. -Four years. I'm sure you met this gentleman in the last four years. No? He was a regular. A lot of people come in here. Could we speak to the owner? He doesn't usually come by. He has a lot of businesses, so if you... Listen, that man was my husband. And he died. We thought he'd killed himself, but it turns out he was murdered. Since he came here every week, you either tell me why and who with or I'll send the police to ask. Then I'll see you in court. -Oscar, ready? -Yes. -Hello? -One minute. I'm here to talk about my husband, Oscar León. He came here every week and I want to know if he was always with the same girl, or various or anything you can tell me. Alejandra, right? Yes. I'm so sorry about Oscar. You'll understand I couldn't go to the funeral. -Did you know him? -Yes. We were friends. Look... I get you have a lot of nighttime establishments and nobody asks for receipts, or anything. It's normal. But you have an excess of cash that you have to justify, otherwise it'll become dirty money. But I've heard about, what's it called? A Dutch Sandwich. -What are you talking about? -Look, all I want is for you to do what you do so things run more smoothly. Call it what you want, this is a crime. A crime is killing your dad or screwing your sister. That's a crime. If the authorities get wind of this, you could get six years, man. Six years. Look... I can recommend any type of investment, I'd love to help. But not with this. Not this. It's a question of principles. -Here. -Great. Thank you. I understand. You have your principles. I have mine. We're both honorable men. But you know what? Everyone has dirty laundry to air. Take me, for example. I have clubs where I put dancers in cages. And you? You sit in your Porsche, an amazing woman in the front seat, a joint in your hand and a baby. Hey! Look who it is. How are you doing, princess? -She ate it all. -Great, thank you, Maru. And your wife has no idea about any of this, because she's in Valencia. We all have two versions of ourselves. Public and private. That doesn't make us less honorable. Don't look at me like that. I'm talking about business for both of us. Good business. Come on, Oscar. Okay? Take a look at it. Hey there, beautiful. -What did you have? -Three glasses of wine, but the drinks in these places are really expensive. Well, the good news is Oscar was the accountant not a customer. Great! From financial engineer to accountant for a brothel, bit of a demo... -You have four new messages. -Quiet. You need to come. There are developments in the investigation of your husband's death. You need to take me to the police station. -What's happened? -Conrado needs to tell me something. Is it something to do with what you said in there? Is it possible Oscar was murdered, Alex? They don't know yet, it's just a line of investigation. I'll take you to the station, but I'm coming in. No, you'll take me and leave me there. -Not happening, sweetie. -You'll leave me there. -They've asked me to be discreet. -But I'm your mother and... Just for once could you not be the mom you want to be and be the mom I need you to be? This is about my pain, not yours. You'll leave me there. So, I can come to the brothel, but not to the station. -Not there, no. -Fine. This is the fiscal activity of the shell companies I found in Oscar's paperwork. As you yourself found, Oscar was moving various amounts of money in and out of the country, for the last three years. The truth is I'm glad to see you. Queen! In total it's a pretty serious amount of money. I still don't know the origin, but it clearly fits with what I've found. And what's that? It seems Oscar gave Vicent a package to take care of, containing rolls of money. And he didn't say anything until now? Maybe I didn't ask the right questions. Queen! The question is: where did he get all of this money? He was unemployed, so either he won the lottery or there's clearly something we don't know. -Are you okay? -Yes, it's just... I had a drink and I feel dizzy. -Should I get you some water? -No, I'm fine. I've also been investigating. I went to a bar called Lula. -You went to Lula? -Yes. I found out he went there and, like you, I imagined the obvious, but it turns out I was wrong. At first I was glad, but now I'm not sure I should be. And what did you find out? He worked for the owner. He was the accountant. That guy has several suits filed against him. For exploitation and money laundering. He's managed to have them thrown out, but I wouldn't be surprised if the money Oscar was moving came from there. So we could have a possible motive... ...for your husband's murder. In two hours, I've gone from thinking he was a john, to finding out he worked for a pimp and that he was possibly murdered. Could you order me a cab? I need to... There's no need. I'll give you a ride. Is something up? I made you a promise I still haven't made good on. Toni! Toni! Conrado... Thank you. For taking you out on a combine harvester? No, for believing me. For the investigation and what you said to me yesterday. No, look... When my wife died, the medication seemed like a good option. You know? Because with them, life slows down, it's... But you don't move anymore. You get used to living like the lions you see at the zoo. In a 5 by 5 cage, waiting for a scrap of meat to be thrown to keep you alive. That's how I was. Yesterday... Yesterday, I told you it's been three years since I behaved like a cop. But what I didn't say, is that it's also been that long since I behaved like a man. And... when I saw you in your nightgown with that energy and excitement, I remembered how exciting life can be when you're an untamed lion, you know? Because you... you've... You've awoken my instincts, you've awoken my... You know? Do you get what I'm saying? I think so, yes. That's why I should be the one thanking you. -Please, no. I'm really... -Yes. -But... -Do you want to make love? What? No. I mean... I'm sorry. -It's just... Oh, God. -Right... No, it's just I'm not ready. I'm not as strong as you. Okay? But when I'm ready, I'll give you a sign. Oh, right. Okay. -Is that okay? -Yes. -Hey. -Hi. -How's it going? -Hi. What did you do with Daddy all day? Where have you been? -Here. -Here? Did you have fun with Daddy? Yes? I'm not sure. Let's see that smile. -Why are you here? -I didn't know where to find you. I just got back from London and found out you were fired. Listen, Oscar. This won't stand. I'll do all I can, I'm going to speak to the president... -What are you laughing at? -You. -Why? -You're a fucking great friend. Come and meet my family. Verónica. -This is Fran. -Hi, nice to meet you. This is Verónica and this one here is Sol. This is Sol. Say hi, Sol. Martina! You came back! Hi! Well, I never actually left. -Well, welcome home. -Thank you. We're going to have dinner. Are you hungry? A little. Dinner time! -Good! -Let's eat. No! Tell her no. She's stealing them. Come on. -Goodnight, Martina. -Goodnight. You can fill the hole left by someone with happy moments, new people and a bit of willpower. And you can be okay, but infidelity and lies become embedded. What concerns me is the pain this novel could cause. I have women close to me who have been cheated on and who might feel offended by it. Right. I really appreciate you coming down here, Darío, but the truth is... -I'm not comfortable with this book. -How could I not come, Blanca. Carme calls and says our star writer won't publish with us. Have you had an offer from another publisher? God, no. I've been with you for twenty years. There's no other offer. I'll tell you something and I'm not paying lip service. This is the best writing you've ever done. I just finished it and can't get it out of my head. -It's very personal and deep. -Darling, I'm not deep. I'm not. I'm imaginative and playful. I'm superficial. We're nominating it for the Aphrodite Award for women's literature. And you know who organizes and pays for that award. Yes. Let me come up with another story. -You know I write quickly. -No, Blanca, please. Look, darling. You've been writing under pen names for years. This is the perfect time to come out and start enjoying the success you deserve. She's passed out. -Do you mind? -No. Thank you. Who taught you to enjoy life like this? I don't know. I guess I've always lived like this. Your family then. -Your parents or something? -No. Not them. Or maybe they did. What do I know? Sorry. You know Conrado pretty well, right? Why do you ask? He took me out on the combine harvester and he kissed me. Really? Fancy that. How does he kiss with that mustache? Then he asked if we could make love. You must have done something to snap that guy out of his trance. Conrado is a great guy. And that's the truth. Thank you. I wish he hadn't been through what he has. -His wife committed suicide. -I heard. He had a terrible time. She was raped and then she killed herself. What? And Conrado was in a kind of limbo. He couldn't sleep, but he couldn't be awake either. It was driving him crazy. Like a shark in an aquarium. Constantly tense. He even beat up a few guys. Anyway, he's a lot better now. He started taking medication and that was that. He's fine now. Do you like him? -Do you like him? -I don't know. I really don't know. Something's happening to me. But I still don't know what it is. It must be this place. I don't really get it. All I know is I feel good here. I feel really good. -What were you keeping for him? -What? -Money, goddammit! A lot of money. -Who gave it to him? No idea. I gave it back to him the day he died. What the hell is wrong with you? Have you stopped taking your pills? -Go fuck yourself. -Fuck you, bastard. Subtitles by explosiveskull
