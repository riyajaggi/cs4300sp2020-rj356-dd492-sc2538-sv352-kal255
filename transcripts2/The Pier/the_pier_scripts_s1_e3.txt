 Subtitles by explosiveskull Look, Vero. The smart looker. -Hello. -So, I was in Frankfurt. And I turned straight back. No flight to Valencia, only a red-eye to Madrid, so I flew to Paris. I had to change airports, flew to Barcelona, from there I took a taxi and finally made it here in my car. You're an outright Phileas Fogg. -And why all this? -Because I have to tell you something. I'm deeply in love with my wife... and with you.

 THE PIER I got my degree in architectural engineering in seven years. I like things to be exactly planned. That's why I specialized in high risers, there's nothing more rational, or more precise. So I know what I'm talking about if I say I'm out of control, shagging a stranger in the restrooms of a bar. ...and what a fight this is, it's Sol in the defense, she heads right, then a left... where... And she goes for the basket...! Very good! C'mon, Sol, school can't wait. Can you hold this for a sec? Come here. I used the chocolate after all. No? You won't give me a kiss?

 Alright, let's go. Oh, can I have it? -Thanks. -Martina! See you! So? Do you like it? -What? -The room. -Yes, a lot. -I'm glad. There's nothing but Sol and Oscar on them. I mean there's none of the family, the grandparents... How was he going to take her see his family? Right, and your family? Your parents? Do you have brothers? No. No brothers. -Are you OK? -Sure. Should I take care of his things, or do you want to leave it? Either way. No. I think I'll go look for another place, this is... No, listen, Martina... I want you to stay. It'll do me good having you around. And Sol loves you already. And if your guy wants to stay over sometime, not a problem. I don't have a boyfriend. I don't know why I wear it. He dumped me. Went for cigarettes, never came back. The usual. Why'd he go? A sexual attraction to another woman. A kind of addiction. -Why? Didn't you have a good sex life? -We did. Well... at least I think we did. It's hard to be objective in these things. Eight years making love to the same person, the same way... Not to say it was just routine, there was passion, but... -I understand. -But what do I know? Maybe you should've slept with someone else? Well... no. I was in love. So? I'm talking about sex, a simple fling. Nobody's business but yours. It's as natural as... breathing. It's a question of, you know... flesh, sensual attraction. -Sex is pure instinct. -I don't know... What? Of course it's instinctive. And I'll tell you something else: a good fuck can turn a terrible day into a good one. True enough. I've had my share of flings. But the only person I ever wanted to wake up next to... was Oscar. -What if we painted the room? -This room? It won't be like a fine fling but it could change the day, too. Sounds great. Let's go. Hey, rice picking lady... Let's get rolling together! When are you two done, so it's my turn? Rice with rabbit is served here tonight! -What are you doing? -Stand by. Where are you going? -Hi there... -C'mon, honey, right here.... Coming for your dessert...? What was that about "taking turns"? You make 'em wait in line at your door to have a go, right? You could sell tickets for the town fair, we'll be there! So why wait for the town fair? Why not right now? -Back off. -Nervous? Just one thing... I get to choose my dessert... Stop it, let me go! -Shut up or I'll rip it out. -Stop, stop! Will you keep calling me a bitch? -I can't hear you. -No, I won't, I won't! Veronica, I think I won't stay tonight. -Anything wrong? -No, just that I can't. -Well, come back soon then. -Sure. Are you crazy, Alex? What's crazy about seeing if Oscar had a child? What child? -How old? -A girl, six years old. A six-year old girl? How wonderful. So when he told you to abort, he had a daughter with her. It wasn't Oscar, we both decided it wasn't the right time. It wasn't the right time with you, but with her, yes. -Blanca, please... -I'd like to know one thing. What does this Veronica think of the whole matter? -About what? -For instance that Oscar was married? -It wasn't a problem. -And about your abortion, your pain? I don't know. -You don't? -No. I didn't tell her who I am. -Excuse me? -Because I need answers! Like what? How often they did it, how their orgasms were, or how they decided to have a baby? Blanca, get off her case. It's hard enough already. Then she needs to stop fooling herself. It's one thing to be married to an asshole, which I'm an expert on, and another to refuse take the blindfold off your eyes. She didn't know he went to the Albufera, had a daughter, neither that he was fired... -What do you mean "fired"? -Just that this letter of notice popped out of one of the boxes at your place which was such a mess. So I was cleaning up and saw it, it's about five years old. Five years? That can't be. Oscar went to work every day. Honey, this woman, forget about her. And forget about Oscar, too. It doesn't matter if he had a job. Forget about it all, it's no longer your life. -What will you do? -No idea. -With this girl? -No idea. Are you planning to be her auntie, her friend, her nanny? And this woman? You want to slap her in the face? -Or put forward a claim? -No, none of it. -So? -So... -So... I won't go back there. -Exactly. I'm staying right here, to live my own life. That of an independent woman, whom great things are happening to. Lots of things. After all, we just sold Valencia's highest building, girl! -Are we clear? -We are. I'll toast to that. -Toast? -Toast. To Alex' life. There you go. Ada, don't you want to take some sun? Those bikini lines are the biggest nuisance there is. You're writing a book on your daughter's life. Of course I'm not. Don't mix things up, please. It's not about my daughter. -It's a about a woman. Fictional. -Yeah, right. A husband with a double-life, who dies. What's next? Let me guess. -He has a daughter with the other woman. -I don't know yet. I'm still not decided. With all the bullshit you just put her through, how is it you forgot to tell her this? You know... The years make me forget how passionately you young ones know how to stand your ground. Where are you going with this? It's devastating, like a virgin's first orgasm. I need your help in this novel. I will not help you to write a book on Alex' life. -Are you a virgin? -What's this about? Sex. It's about sex. Oscar? Hello, Krueger, how are you, I couldn't make the trip. -Hello? -Wait a minute, Krueger. -I'm losing you. -When can we do the meeting? -Absolutely, next week is fine. -Are you there? -Can you hear me? -When... do... meeting? You don't have fiber, do you? Krueger, can you hear me? Veronica, there's no reception. -Fran. -How was the trip? Listen, I need a favor. Sure, what's up? It's a bit complex, you need to be discreet. I need you to get in touch with the Germans. -I'm not in Frankfurt. -Where the hell are you then? -In the Albufera. -Albufera... Again? I know, I know. Call these people and tell them to buy forests in Brazil. Brazil, Norway and Gabun, don't forget. And tomorrow you sell before New York closes, and... And then, rice. As soon as Chicago opens you go bullish. -All good, I'll call you. -Oscar, what's going on with you? I'll tell you later. What do you do for a living? Well, I buy and sell stuff. But you didn't come to such a nice place with no reception to work, did you? Well, the truth is.... no. So what do you do where there's no WiFi? How are you? I'm sorry I didn't call, I didn't know what to say. -I was still in shock. -Me too. I brought the Lisbon guide we borrowed. We went to all the places you marked, you and Oscar. Fran, did you ever notice he was in bad shape? Never noticed anything strange? We've been friends all our lives. We've been out and on trips together. Christmas and New Year's eve... And any of those times during those five years, you didn't think once to tell me that my husband had been fired? -I'm sorry. -What happened? He made a big mistake, a big investment went wrong and it all went down the drain. He thought he'd straighten it out. Maybe that's why he didn't tell you. He wanted to find a similar job, or he just didn't want to worry you. Want to know what I think? That they don't fire you for one mistake. They fired him because he didn't come to work for a single day in five years because he was with his lover. Which you knew about, and helped him and lied to me about. Right or wrong, Fran? Did you know he had a lover in the Albufera? Do you think Oscar loved me? -Yes. He loved you. -And her? Did he lover her? Also. He loved her too. I thought you were my friend. But you're only a bastard. He lied to you, not me. I'd never lie to you. I ran my car into hers. If I'd gone back just out of loneliness she would have thought I'm crazy. So I staged an accident. I told her I was a biologist studying the local bird-life. So I asked if I could rent a room in her place. She told me I should've had some flings with other men. I don't know why... My God, what am I doing? For sure, I gashed my head and dislocated my neck, so I probably need some medication. She needs to stop fooling herself. ...and that he had a daughter... ...that he went to the Albufera... Cool vibe here. -My little town fair... -Oops, sorry! Hey there! This Oscar. Oscar, Conrado. What are you having? It's on me. -Casalla. -OK, seven casalla shots it is! -You should play him. -But watch out, I'm good. Yes, sir, here we go! No harm done. -This is Vicent. -Give me a hug, man. Hi, Llum, give me a hug too... How' yo doing? Good evening everyone. What did Oscar do? Had to go to Frankfurt every week in the beginning. Later, he tried to work from here, online. But it didn't work. In the end, he just quit. He quit... And why did he quit? How'd you like to go away every week with all this here? So he quit and started doing the numbers for some neighbors. What a nice job you have. I like it. I'll go see who it is. If they bother you, I'll take them. Hey, what a surprise. What's it owed to? Nothing. I was in the area. And someone sent me a video onto my cellphone. And I thought you should see it. -Can I come in? -Sure. I get to choose my dessert. You didn't have to come for that. I'm doing you a favor. This kids' parents want to press charges. -Against me? Why? -Bodily harm. The kid has a hemorrhage. In his dick. The kid? The guy insulting me on the corner wasn't a kid. The one calling me a whore. -He's a minor, and you know it. -Oh, so now he's a minor! The guy waving his dick in the wind at me asking me to eat my dessert, a "kid"? That's not the question here... The question here is why people think they can judge and humiliate others who, according to them, don't fit in. And they tell you this waving their dick and calling you a whore. And why? Because they think they're better than you. You know what these people need? A nice, hard pain in the balls to get them off their pedestals they got onto only by some fucked-up moral code. -Am I right or wrong? -You'll lose everything! -Oh, really? -You gotta go and apologize. I will not. There's seven charges pressed against you. What do you think a judge will say to that? What's with Sol if you go to jail? Have you told her yet, that Oscar...? -Have you told her? -I just couldn't yet. Vero, you think I don't understand. But I went through the same hell. Listen, we'll be OK. Do you hear? You and I will be fine. More than fine. I have a roommate now. Her name is Martina. She studies ducks. -Seriously? -I'll introduce you. -Martina, come down for a sec. -Coming... This is Conrado, sheriff of the Albufera. And Martina, she's a biologist. Oh, really? She'll be staying with me here a while to study our birds. That's right. Pleased to meet you. So... fine. Anything you need, come by the precinct. -Thank you. -I'll show you out. -It's a nice day. -Yep. -I'll go to take some pictures. -Do that. I know what you think. This is like out of a Saturday afternoon movie, but I assure you, I'm not crazy. You want me to keep your secret. Why are you doing this? Because I need answers that you're not giving me. So ask. You knew Veronica and my husband had a long relationship, that he'd been here for so long... -Yes, I knew. -Didn't that seem important? Shouldn't you have told me from the beginning? It didn't seem relevant. I didn't want to add to your pain. What? You didn't want to add to my pain? You had to know I'd find all the stuff on his cellphone, now I'm buying books on birds only to try and find out if my marriage was a sham and he was happier with her than... Listen to me, please! This is what we'll do. I'll help you to find answers. But you have to come with me to a certain place. Grief therapy. But... Things like this happen to others too. I spent 500 euros on bird books. I'm studying them. I don't even like birds. But now that I'm reading up on them, I'm starting to like them. So I'm asking myself now if I maybe never enjoyed making love either. Maybe it was just because Oscar liked to. Or maybe I liked it but did it the way he wanted, not me, or maybe I never wanted it. I ask myself all these absurd questions and I can hardly stand myself. I think Oscar must've gone through this too. That he must've entered this zone, too. Which zone? The one where you lose control. The best was the way they all looked when you told them you didn't understand a word they were saying. And the face I made when you won three times against me at darts. -Oh, look... -Oh, that, well... Nevermind. I'll get you another one. -How about this? -Thanks. -You know each other long? -Who? -Well, that husky countryman... -Vicent? Exactly. The one who thanked you by kissing you. -Which is really nice by the way. -I've known him all my life. -And we were together for a while. -Really? -I'll say. -Conrado and me, too. Except that Conrado and me was a really long time ago. The sheriff guy? Not bad. Why? -Nothing. I like him. He's... -Do you really? He's a great guy. -Is he? -The type you like being near. -Water? -No. I know I shouldn't ask you but... I don't know if it's right but I need to ask you... Ask me what? Do you still go to bed with the fisherman, the sheriff, others? Well, yeah... It happens. A lot of guys? Some... I'm getting ahead of myself, it's all just a bit weird. OK, it all may seem strange. But don't you think it's a bit strange, too, that you came all the way here, crossing half of Europe by plane, train and car? Look at me. Just one question. Are you in love? With the fisher-guy, the sheriff, me? No. I'll head outside for a moment. -I need to think. -OK. Or maybe I don't know what I'm doing. No, I don't know what I'm doing. Ownership isn't for me. If I fall in love it's not to make you leave all behind and live with me. I like having you close by. For as long as you want to be here. That's all. But if it hurts you. If... If you can't deal with it... I don't want that to happen. I'm sorry, you came at a bad moment, I have a meeting. Is that so? With whom? You won't believe it, but a spectacular woman, sexy, intelligent, exciting... There's a lot of those. How will you recognize her? She said she'd be coming in some awesome violet, silk panties. You wouldn't, by any chance, be wearing some? No, actually, I don't remember. -What if I'm wearing no panties at all? -Good thought! Did you know 9 out of 10 dermatologists dis-advise from using underwear? They say it destabilizes the blood flow. Keep going, they'll go away. Katia, can you come out for a sec? -What's wrong, honey? -I spoke to Fran, he knew everything. -What exactly? -About Oscar and Veronica. The sheriff knew, too. Everyone knew, except me. He was his friend. How was he tell you? And you, as his friend, did you know too? Tell me the truth because I'll find out anyway. Look, Alex... I saw them once. But it was five, six years ago, walking the dog. He said she was a colleague. And you believed it? Who goes for a walk on the beach with a colleague and a dog? I'm not stupid, I didn't believe it. Later, I asked, and he said it was nothing. That it was under control. So I thought 'one night stand'. -Yeah, right! -People screw people, Alex! What's the big deal? You fuck to get things out of your system. -Hey, boss, what's your opinion? -What? I said, what's your opinion? I don't know, maybe... I'd say people take little infidelities in their marriages for granted. -Let's go and ask your wife then! -Hey, leave me out of this. -I've got nothing to do with it. -You knew too? What is this, a fucking two-timers club? Or maybe I'm the stupid bitch that doesn't screw every next guy! Cut the crap! Not getting involved can save marriages too. How do I know if you two had a deal? How do I know if you knew or not? What could I have done? You could've talked to me. Not with him. With me. You could've stopped this six years ago. And maybe we could've kept him from killing himself. Alex. Alex! Hey, honey, what's the matter? Sol? What's the matter, Sol? What's the matter, honey? It's OK.... A boy said that Daddy's dead. -Who said that? -One of the older ones. In the school courtyard. A blond guy, with hair like a girl. He said Daddy killed himself. It's OK, my love... It's OK, dear. Sometimes people... get really tired of everything... Tired of what? Well, of taking a walk, of all those sundowns, even of breathing. So, in the end, they get really tired of everything. Maybe that happened to Daddy. If he was tired, why didn't he just go to bed? Right, sweetie. He should have done that. But look... This doesn't happen to me, nor to you, right? No. See? It doesn't happen to us. No matter how much we run or how long the day, we never get tired. We smile. We smile away the problems. Let's see that smile. The way you know how to. That's right... So don't worry, my love. Because I'll always be here for you. OK? Can we go get Daddy out of heaven now..? No, love. No, we can't. Come here. I'll always be with you. I'll always be here for you. The mind always wants to be in control. It wants explanations. But some things are not of the mind, but come from the guts. To overcome pain, you'll feel pain. And that means losing control. Control is a bear trap. It's nothing but fear. But with fear, your life is only half-lived. It's a life half-felt, half-loved half-painful... The pain, the love, the happiness, the misery, and the tragedy: it's all part of life. Feeling is living. She's a little girl. She's six years old. And you tell her her daddy killed herself? We need to let the feelings happen, the good and bad. They need to come out, stir us... ...but not dominate us. If we let them flow, they go away. And we're free again. I'm sorry. None of this is your fault. I'm sorry. Subtitles by explosiveskull
