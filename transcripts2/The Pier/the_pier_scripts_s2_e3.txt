 - Why didn't you tell me what happened? - What for? - What for? - What do you mean, "what for?" Friends for 15 years and someone else has to tell me Oscar got you in trouble, and you were almost boiled alive because of him? Look, I know he stole 1 million. We can get a loan or I'll sell the horse he left me. What do I need a thoroughbred for? Really? - Why did he need it? - He had it to launder money. That horse is worth a fortune. Don't you worry about the money, okay? Vicent had it all along and we gave it back.

 The thing is, now they want something else. A blue notebook with their accounts in that Oscar apparently stole. - A blue notebook? - Yes. - Why would he steal a notebook? - I have no idea. I don't know why he wanted that money, I know nothing about Oscar! - Any idea where it could be? - No. No. Fran, do you think Oscar could have been planning to run with a third woman? There was a third woman? I don't know. There's a third apartment. In a town called Taracuellos in Castellón. I went there with the police. - What was Oscar doing there? - I don't know. Shit...

 Listen, I promise you that... I'll look everywhere for that notebook. Okay? Alex, promise me you won't tell the cops. Please. - Did you see who did this to you? - No, their faces were hidden. All I saw was... that one of them had a scar on their hand, that's all. Anyway, you didn't drag me out at this hour on a Tuesday to listen to my woes. Should we have some shots? - Yes. - Yeah? Tequila? Tequila! Excuse me... Two shots of tequila. Make it four. THE PIER - Hello. - Hi. - What are you doing? - What am I doing? It's 2am. - So, why are you awake so late? - I've been out dancing. I really wanted to dance. Then I called Fran and I've had about 25 shots. You had 25 shots? Well, it was more like three, but everything is spinning. Goodness. The best thing is to lie down and let everything spin. - Are you lying down? - Yes. You know what? I really like watching you when you're lying down. The little dimples that appear on your back? - I love those. - On my back? Well, where your coccyx is. I also really like the curve of your waist. How it dips down from your hip and then comes back up again. When I came back from taking Sol to the bus the other morning, I had to get back into bed with you. You give off so much heat in the mornings You came back to bed naked. And... I think I was a little aroused. Actually... a lot. Aren't you going to ask me what I'm wearing or anything? I actually called to ask you something. Shoot. Would you mind if I came to Valencia to see you? - Of course not. - Are you sure? Of course. Why would I mind? Hey. - Hi. - Is this a bad time? Not at all. I always have guests at 2 o'clock in the morning. You look nice enough to be receiving guests. So do you. Come in. This is some place you have. And the... views are beautiful. It must be amazing to wake up every morning surrounded by... glass and concrete. Plus there are loads of people to spy on. I couldn't sleep. And... I couldn't stop thinking about how brave you were for coming to La Albufera. To see how Oscar and I lived. And ever since I found out about all of his shady dealings, I've realized I didn't really know who he was, how he lived... or what he wanted. It's weird because when we were together, I didn't care about all that. I didn't need to know where he was or which side of the bed he slept on with you, but I think I need to know now... to be able to get him out of my head. Will you tell me a happy memory you have? About you two. I WANT TO SEE YOU WRAPPED IN CELLOPHANE It's weird because all I remember is one of my mom's birthdays. My mom doesn't like getting older so instead of inviting her friends, she invites mine. Don't ask me why. And I thought, the best is yet to come. The party, right? Excuse me, Blanca. This is a really important call. - Don't worry. - Forgive me. I have to get this... Marcos! How are you? - Hello? - I can't believe she's telling the story about the literary prize she was given at that brothel again. Unbelievable. I can't listen to it again. Listen, I need to make love to you right here, right now, in a public place. - That sounds like a great idea actually. - True. The problem is, I'm out of the office right now. - Let's go to the restroom, right now. - Any other time, I would have... I don't think I can, because I'd need to check the blueprints. I'll check the blueprints for you to find the emergency exit. Touch yourself. Touch yourself now. I'm watching you. I'm just going to go outside, it's real noisy in here. - That way we can talk... - Don't move. You doing it in front of people turns me on. Okay, just a second. Can you get me some water? - Water? - Don't laugh. Don't laugh! I didn't know you had sex in public places. No... we didn’t. Oscar liked to tease me because he knew I couldn't do it. I've never done it in a bathroom or a changing room or anything. - You haven't? - No, it's not my thing. What about you two? We didn't either. Thank you. You're welcome. It's 7am, Katia. I had to get out of the house before Ada woke up. I can't look her in the eye. If I do, she'll know I'm hiding something. Why don't you tell her? I need to plan how to tell her, it'll be a massive shock for her. If you don't tell her soon, she'll work it out for herself. So will Big Boss. I'm not worried about him, he knows I've been seeing other people. But what if he asks? You can't tell him it's someone else's. That doesn't make any sense, Katia. It's my child, because I'll be having it. - I won't put a gun to anybody's head. - A gun? What are you talking about? If I tell him, he'll be cracking bottles of champagne. He'll give us all vacations and leave Minerva. He'll get back with me. He gets all dopey about kids, you don't know him. Our story hasn't been a fairytale, but at least it was real. I can't be a millstone around his neck. Okay, don't get back together with him. But you do have to tell him. He's the father, girl. Can I go throw up? - Good morning. - Morning. I heard you talking and didn't want to intrude. - Congratulations, by the way. - Thank you. - Hey. - Hi. Got any more of these? I don’t think so. Okay, are you guys together or not? - Don’t be such a bore! - It wouldn't matter! We've all fooled around with a girlfriend. Go on, tell her. - Tell her what? - Who you fooled around with. Conrado. With the police lieutenant? Long live Spain, girl! Long live Spain! It's about time you had a good seeing to. Therapy's fine but a bit of a bore, right? A home-grown, experienced veteran. Not bad from time to time. Right, but in the spirit of honesty, I should also confess he's a good lay. What? It's true! Good. Anyway, I don't know... He probably also needed to move on from his grief too, right? I'm really glad, but I know you and you don't do one-night stands. Are you serious about him? I don't know, Katia. I like him. And he helps me stop thinking. One second. Shit! "The Qatari investors are on their way, where the hell are you?" - You pay while I get the car. - Okay. Absolutely not. This is on me. The check, please. Verónica... When you burned all of my things... did you also burn Oscar's? Some of them. Well, all of them. Why? Do you remember seeing a blue notebook? It doesn't ring any bells. There was nothing blue. Why? It's Andrés' accounting book. Fran told me that Oscar stole it. - Oscar stole it? - Yes and Andrés is looking for it. Why would Oscar do that? I don’t know, but it could be related to his death. We need to find it. Sure. I'll look for it. I'm going to begin by giving a summary of the project, then Arturo will detail the costs. And ladies, if they ask you anything, which they won't, only then may you speak. It's not sexism, bullying or anything like that. You know you're great, but if there's anything about the project, this studio, or our damn faces that this guy doesn't like, there will be no skyscraper or project, you got that? Yes, Jaume. We'll all keep our mouths shut. Just like podium girls. But the ones from Formula 1 who, in my opinion, are super-hot. Well, it's time. Everybody in their places. Artur, you're over here. Ladies, you sit there. The past is a straight line. This building, curbed and asymmetrical, is a sculpted forest. That's the future. It's the Martina Tower. A name chosen by the architect. This is a skyscraper. We'll have the strongest identity in the world. Inside there will be 420 prestige apartments. Oh, we want no apartments. Investment on it is way too high. Okay, the land is listed for residential use. Then it's got to be changed to commercial use. At this stage, we cannot change the use of the building. Do you know that the sale of apartments doesn't necessarily include its construction, right? Mr. Abdulah... May I point out I believe you're making a mistake? Everyone is looking for identity. When you dwell in a different environment to the rest you find identity. In this tower, every apartment is unique. That's why I think this is perfectly cost effective. You’re Arabs. Arabs are receptive to beautiful things: horses, art, astronomy... In the West, we are business oriented and corrupt. We like the sensitivity your culture has. And now you're telling me that you want in here to build movie theaters, malls, perfume shops instead of infusing life into it? I can assure you all those apartments will find a buyer. And your investment will bear a huge profit. 28 percent at least, actually. We should not be discussing this, but I will share this with you. We showed this project to at least six different people and all of them, all six of them, have already ordered an apartment. These are investors that have hundreds of investment opportunities. So why do you think they chose this building? Was it just because they find it beautiful? No. They like the exclusivity. So we'll set the selling price. Exclusivity is priceless. Trust us. What do you think? That we're fired. I think... Oh. Let's go. You bitches. We got it! Listen up, everyone make their way to happy hour. If I see anyone working or sober in the next ten minutes, they're fired! Is that clear? What is it? Are you okay? What is it, sweetie? Ada, what is it? This portrait of Arnolfini and his wife is one of the most significant in 19th century Flemish art. Now that's a work of art, man. Quiet! A double whopper and it's on Ada! - What do they mean by whopper? - It doesn't matter, Mom. Everyone knows! Everyone has seen the photos and knows it's me. Okay, just calm down. We'll go to school and talk to your teachers, problem solved. That won't solve anything. They already saw them and know it's me. I want to die. Just one second, don't even joke about that. - Don't even joke. - Mom... I almost took all the pills we have in the house. - What are you talking about? - I want to disappear. I want to be gone, I totally understand Oscar now... Listen to me. Promise if you ever think that again, you'll call me. - I called but you didn't answer. - Try again. - I called 20 times. - Well, call me 40 damn times! Or call Alex or Blanca till they answer. Damn it. Look at me. - You don't want to die. - What do you know? I do know. I'm your mother. But why? Because I'm a kid and know nothing about life? You're going to be a sister. You have two new messages. Lieutenant, I was going to send you a voice note, but as you don't have WhatsApp I'll leave you another voicemail. I hung up by accident. The music is because we're at happy hour. We're here to celebrate selling my skyscraper for the second time. I'm calling to tell you that... I don't usually go around sleeping with strangers. Though, when I think about it, I didn't really know my husband either. God, how embarrassing. Well, I'm not the kind of person to sleep with someone and then run out on them the next morning, so I don't know what this is or where it's going, but... I just needed you to know that. So... I'm sending you a hug. Or a kiss. Whatever you prefer. Mom! Why didn't you tell me before? I don’t know. Because I'm 40 years old and... the father doesn't know. And because I think about having a baby and it makes me really happy. Then you come in here saying you want to die and... shit! And motherhood's a minefield and I don't know if I'm ready. - I don't know. In fact, I'm not. - Mom... - I can't do it. - Of course you can, Mom. I'm not going to kill myself. Not anymore, at least. I'm not convinced. This is what we're going to do, okay. If at some point, I think of doing anything stupid I promise I'll ring Blanca, Alex, even the president himself if I have to, but I won't do it. I won't because we have to look after this baby here. Okay. Everything okay? I forgot my keys. Are you coming to party, Ada? Thanks, Jaume, but we're going home. Okay. Shut your mouth. Katia, you want to keep your job, right? Of course. A minute or two ago I told all of my employees to get down to happy hour. Hang on, didn't you realize my mom was joking? Mom, I'm going home to do my Latin project. I'll keep my cellphone on but if you show up in 20 minutes, I'll know you don't trust me. Okay. - I love you. - I love you too. - The novel. - What are you doing here, Mom? I decided not to publish it. I spoke to my editor and told her I can't screw up my daughter's life. I spent about an hour destroying 50 files on my computer... Being a mother for once. And then, because of this uncontrollable ego problem that I have, I had to finish it. I thought, "If Phillip Roth can use his own father's agony to write a masterpiece, how couldn't I write my daughter's story?" - Phillip Roth? - Yes, Phillip Roth. The only thing I can say in your favor is you showed me it first. Honestly, I thought you were going to give me the go-ahead. That you wouldn't mind so much and you'd be happy when you heard they were giving me a prize and making a series out of the novel. Don't use emotional blackmail, Mom. Your novel would be great if it was about someone else and not me. You're right. You're right! Gin and tonic? - Excuse me. - Two gin and tonics. What type of gin would you like? Listen, I want you to keep talking when I come back to the table and make an excuse, like you're sick, because we're leaving. I understand that you're in a hurry, but it's really not possible. I can't make it. - Everything okay, honey? - Yes. Blanca, sorry could you repeat that last part, I missed it all. Well, this is the story of when I went to a brothel for an award with those guys, right? - Are you feeling okay? - Yes. - I don't think that... - Mom. Mom! Sorry to interrupt, but we're going to have to go, I'm feeling a bit drunk. - Come on, darling. - You know me, I can't drink much. - She really can't... - Sweetie, I have to go. - Yes, we're going. - No, I have to go. For real. It's important. It's the Japanese stock market, Fran. I'm sorry, honey, I have to go. I'm sorry. Excuse me. - Hey. - Fran! - How's it going? - Good. - How are you? - Good, why are you here? I went to your office, but saw you'd already left, so... Yeah, we're here to celebrate selling my building. For the second time. Wow, that's great. - Right? The perfect day, in that case. - Yes. I just left my wife. What happened? I don't know, Alex. I suddenly realized that I don't... have anything real in my life, you know? And... I've always been living someone else's life. Oscar's life, Marisa's... It's like I've never been able to make my own decisions. So... I'm here to tell you the only real thing that I recall. And it's that I've always been in love with you, Alex. Always. Wow, in one go! I'm so sorry for being late, but it's really hard to find roses at this time of night. My goodness, what a lovely gift. Thank you so much. - Thanks. - You're welcome. They smell so good! - Smell them! - Pass them here. We couldn't go without giving her a gift. Let's go. - Let's. - We have to go, ladies and gents. Have a great time and we might see each other soon. Who knows. Enjoy! And... I can't take it anymore. I can't... I'm tired of looking for excuses not to make love to my wife, you know? I just had to tell you. - What's up? - How are you doing? - Where's Alejandra? - I think she's over there somewhere. - Thanks. - Sure. - Alejandra. - Hi! Hi. I hope you don't mind me showing up without calling. Of course not, I love that you came. Could you just give me five minutes? - Of course. - Yeah? Fran... Look at me. I love you so much, Fran. - So much. - Right. But I'm not in the same place as you. I've spent my whole life in a stable relationship, in a sort of normality and it was really great, but now what I need is... to come off the beaten track. You know? I need... I need to find my own path. Even if I don't know what that is or which way to go, I need... to explore the road not taken. You know? And... - And you... - I understand. I understand perfectly. I always seem to return to the beaten track. - I'm sorry. - No! No. - I don't know. - Thank you. For me, it has to be the pyramids. I'm sure that the Empire State Building is more beautiful, but from a civil engineering perspective, nothing beats the Egyptian pyramids. He's just the kind of guy you need. A cop? - A stud. - How do you know he's a stud, Mom? Just look at him. Look at how they're all drawn to him and the scent of his testosterone. In fact, the stud is an animal in danger of extinction. - Very sought-after. - You're right. You've no idea how happy that guy could make you in bed. He could raise the dead, girl. What? - What did I say? - The dead? Well, I didn't mean that. Do you know what that fish is made of? It's amazing. - Everything okay? - Yes, everything's fine. I mean with Ada? She had real panda eyes. That was nothing. Just teenage drama. - What about with me? - Everything is good with you too. Okay. You not wanting us at the meeting with the Qatari's was nothing to do with us splitting up, right? Katia, you're the most powerful woman that I have on my team. I don't want you out of anything. - Nothing at all, okay? - Okay, thank you. The way we left things was really ugly. I thought we could meet up and talk. - What? - You heard me. You saw me with Minerva. - We've met up a few times. - How's it going with her? She isn't you. But I thought about what you said. Having the right to a clean slate, starting over and... we're trying. I'm really happy for you. Fran, I need you to cover for me. Something bad has happened. Take care of Alex, for me. Thanks, man. Verónica. How's Sol? What are you doing here? I said it wasn't necessary. - How could I not, she's in hospital. - I told you it's not meningitis. - So, what is it? - The flu or tonsillitis maybe, but it's not meningitis. God, you scared me. Can I go see her? She'll be a while. They're still doing tests. I bet you didn't bring cigarettes. No, right? Oh, man. - Weren't you quitting? - Yes. But this didn't seem the best time. - Should I see what I can find? - It's fine. You should go. - I'm staying here with you and Sol. - Look, she's fine. She doesn't have a fever, I can survive without nicotine and if I can't I'll just bite a nurse. No, I'm staying. Weren't you in the middle of something? Go on then. Go. Come on. Go. I'll call you later. Go on. Don't worry. Go on. Get out of here! Don't even think about it. I won't let you quit. - But why not? - You'll get cravings at 2am and I'll be sent out to find cigs. - No, no, no. - But I want to quit. - I promise I really do this time. - I know that you do, but don't throw away any more tobacco. - Poor ducks. - Give it. What if I ask nicely? I still won't. What if I scream? If you scream, you'll scare the ducks. - Give it. - Not even if you kick me. I'll hide it and you'll have no idea where it is. - Give it! - No! No, no, no! - Where is it? Tell me! - No, please! - Okay, okay. - Tell me. I hid it so well, I don't remember where it is. Great. - I'm going to find it. - Sure. Wait.
