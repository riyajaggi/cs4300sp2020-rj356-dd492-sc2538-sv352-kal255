 Yes they're there. We've made it. We have succeeded. We've made it. I can't believe it. We are the whores you love! Repeat with me. We are the whores you love! With me! Take that, Calatrava! Oh my God! How many people there were inside, how many people! And who was the English oldie? That one of the British investment fund? With that of Such & Trust, no. Because the one from Such & Trust has given me two cards, one of work ... and the other of pleasure. Room 302? No, you will not go. No. You won't go! Is Oscar, is Oscar. "Alex ...". Honey, I'll put you on speaker. "How was it?" Well ... Well ... Your wife just sold a skyscraper of 311 million euros, Óscar! Your wife and her partner. "Fuck, yes!" "I told you, you want to spend the whole crisis making reforms". I told you! "Fuck, I'm very proud of you, fuck!" "I love you so much. Alex, to you a little more." Me too, honey. How are you? What's up in Frankfurt? Have you finished the meetings? "Yes, yes, I went down to eat something in the hotel bar ..." Oh, I'll leave you then. I hear people ... "No, wait." "Can you close the speakerphone just a moment?" Sure. Tell me, honey. Yes, honey. Of course I would. Me too. What did he say? Nothing. Let's go party! No, listen. We go to my house, we open a bottle of wine ... But what wine bottle? We're going to party! Yes? Is this the house of Oscar Leon? Yes it is. Who's speaking? Are you his wife? Yes, yes I am. Tell me. I'm calling from the barracks of the Civil Guard. We just found your husband's car. It's on a pier of La Albufera. "There's a corpse inside it and ... we think it could be your husband. Huh... What? We need you to come here to identify him. Eh ... No, look, it must be a mistake ... My husband is in Frankfurt. I've talked to him tonight, so.. No, it can not be. Even so, we need that you come to recognize it. Eh ... Well ... Yes, yes, of course, of course. "Hi, I'm Oscar León, leave your message." Hey, love, just call me \ N the Civil Guard is telling me that your car has appeared in La Albufera with a corpse inside. I do not know ... Call me, please. "Hi, I'm Oscar León, leave your message." I don't even know what hotel you are in. Call me. "Hi, I'm Oscar León, leave your message." Oscar, please stop sleeping, I have been called to recognize your corpse, call me, please! "Hi, I'm Oscar León, leave your message." "Hi, I'm Oscar León, leave your message." "Hi, I'm Oscar León, leave your message." "Hi, I'm Oscar León..." "Hi, I'm Oscar León..." Good morning. I am ... I'm Alejandra Leyva, they've called me to come to ... to identify a person. Mrs. Leyva, I'm lieutenant Conrad. Pleasure meeting you. Over here please. Thank you very much for coming at this hour. DoN't worry, call me anytime. Yes. Look, she's Mrs. Leyva, the wife of ... Pleasure meeting you. Mrs. Leyva. And when she uncovered the sheet, I saw it was him. He was Oscar. I was embarrassed to say it was my husband and go fast, so... I stayed there... looking for a while. Looking what? I do not know, in case there was something... that could you make me say: "It's not him." But it was. So I didn't say anything. He had a fingernail painted in blue... Light blue. What? I don't know. Mrs. Leyva... It's him. He's my husband. What... What happened? He has suffered a poisoning by carbon monoxide. Where? On one of the piers of La Albufera. An accident? No, I don't think so. Apparently, your husband placed a rubber in the exhaust pipe and then he introduced it \ N through the car window. We believe that your husband has committed suicide. But he was in Frankfurt. He called me last night, I heard people speaking German, he is in Frankfurt. Well... Look, if you have intention to take your own life, it's normal to lie. I'm really sorry. No. No, no, no, honey. I have to comfort you, \ N but ... I can't. Sorry. He was my friend too. Why the fuck did he do something like that? \ N I don't know. But when he called you, did he say anything strange to you? Did you notice something strange, something ...? No. Right now I'm just thinking the last time I saw him. I was showering and he was washing his teeth. Alex, I'm going to the airport. The tie. Do you know what's the last thing I told him? What? Your tie does not fit. To change his tie. Don't use this tie. Surely because it was horrible. Yes? He didn't pay anything for them. He kissed me through the glass. Oh honey... Do you want to see something? I help you finish it. The city boy has no idea how to fix a hose. Sir, could you fix it? Yes! The car. Last generation. Look. Let's see. We could eat it today. Maybe it's a little early, isn't it? No, it still early. Hi there. Watch out. No, don't put anything of his disconsolate wife or of "having received spiritual help " or anything like that. No, look, I tell you. Put: "Your wife will still love you, wherever you are.", Well, elegant and concise. Centered, large print, in bold ... Oh. No, do not put anything "we pray a prayer in your memory" not a cross in the middle or anything like that. We are Lutherans. Thank you. Please, to be published tomorrow, ok? Alex, I'm going to the airport. Are you better? Yes. You have to prepare a suit for Oscar to take to the funeral home Do you want me to choose it? No, I'll do it. How did I not realize that he wanted to die? Oh, sweetheart... What goes through the head of another is always an enigma, you know? Even if it's your husband and sleep with you, in the same bed, every night. It is impossible to know. I'm going to look for the shoes. What do you think of these, baby? No, those hurt him. Only when he walks a lot. With all this, I haven't told you that they have given me the skyscraper. Really? Could that be why they sent you flowers? "I'm very proud of you". "We're going to celebrate your skyscraper in Paris." "I bought tickets to see the Rolling Stones there, without schedules or phones, you and me. I love you, Oscar". Does not it seem weird someone plan a trip, send me flowers and then kill himself? Of course it doesn't seem the most logical. Look Eh ... Yesterday, several neighbors They saw your husband enter at the village bar. Apparently, he was drinking and then bought a bottle. This was about 8 o'clock in the afternoon. Everything points to that after your husband went to his car and there he drank more than half of the bottle. We have found her in the interior. No, it can not be, Óscar didn't drink... I mean, he didn't drink like this, he couldn't be him. He got dizzy with nothing, the other day we took Two glasses of wine and I had to take the car... They have not found injuries on their palate, so it seems that nobody forced him to swallow anything. There is also no presence of other narcotic substances in his blood, No sign of violence, struggle... You really don't understand, Óscar was not depressed. He was fine, he called me yesterday to.. to.. to tell me.. "Can you close the speakerphone just a moment?" Tell me, honey. "I would like to have a child with you" "You wouldn't like, at some point, that someone could say: 'Look at that skyscraper over there, my mom did it. '" Yes, of course I'd like it. A few years ago I aborted. We could not square our life with a child. But now we were fine. We were really fine. So how are you going to ask me to have a child and .. Did he plan to kill himself? It is not.. no.. It has no sense. You know? No. My wife wanted to buy a dog. But it didn't help. Look, don't try to find the logic of his last hours of life because.. because there can not be. I know what I'm saying is much harder that if it was an accident, I know, because here are questions. But, well, let's keep investigating, ok? I'm going to take first.. note the address of the florist, I will ask again for registration of the movements of the signal of your mobile and anything that you have or can remember, Please call me. Did he leave me a note or.. anything? These are the personal objects of your husband. My husband only had this phone. This is not his. It could be for work. Many people have a phone for work. I'm sorry, I share your sentiment. It was a tragedy that accident... Forgive me for coming like this. That bastard makes me be.. Alex. We're so sorry. Thank you. I'm sorry, Alex. I don't know what to say. It's fine, honey. Have you slept? No Ada, would you bring me a bottle of water from the aisle machine? Sure. Come here. What's going on? Oscar had two cell phones. The Civil Guard gave it to me. I haven't dared to look at it. Where are they? Here. Have you opened it? Password. He always puts the same just in case. Try it. Birthday, birth, anniversary? The anniversary, once he put the anniversary. Do you have the PUK? Katia, I didn't know he had this phone How will I have the PUK? No, no, no, Alex, what are you going to do? Alex, please... No, no, you can't go in there... She is destroyed. Let's give her a minute to say goodbye, please, a little bit of privacy. A little bit of privacy, please. Just move a little. Thank you. Go to last calls Who the fuck are all these people? I don't know. I'll see if there are.. photos or videos or something like that. "Good morning." "What are you doing? I'm recording." "Why do you record me?" "To remember what you are like before you become a wild animal" "Where're you going?" Alejandra, honey. I just wanted to say my condolences, I'm so sorry. Thank you. One moment, she is... she's a bit affected. "I'm pretty sure he was a hamster." "Leave it now, go. No." "Stop recording me just to record." There's your mother-in-law. Your mother-in-law. -Alejandra, honey. María Luisa. What happened? What has happened to my son's mind to do something like that? I.. I'll come back. "As an anniversary gift it has not been bad, right?" "Do you know you're very pretty after you cum?" "Oh really?" "Yes." "Your eyes sparkle a lot." "My eyes shine. Let's see" Let's see.. Your eyes don't shine. "Oh, is that so? No. Your eyes blush. Stop that now, Alex. No. It's not the time. When is the time? when they incinerate him? When? "You know there's something better than smoking marijuana before fucking?" "Oh really?" "Yes" "Do you know what it is?" "No, I do not know." "Smoke it, after." I can't believe it. Now Alejandra, his wife, has written a few words to dismiss my brother Oscar after this unfortunate accident. Alex. I remember... of your colored socks with giraffes and pandas, of your bracelets on the bedside table of worn leather that you almost never put on, of the Billie Holiday's album that played on Sundays, of the blanket on the sofa and when I was asleep and you painted me with marker... "I love you"... in the back, of the trip to France, when we ate sandwiches on tables.. hardwood and when you fixed the... the rear-view mirror with my stockings. All those memories are... the photos of our happiness. One moment, please, a moment. One moment, please. I want to clarify one thing.. because I heard this morning, several times, that Óscar has had an accident and.. and it is not true. No. Oscar killed himself. He has taken a rubber band, he's got it in the car's exhaust pipe and killed himself. Oscar killed himself. Come on, come on. I think it's important let them know. Let's go. Katia, they have to know. They have to know. Alex... "I'll put you on speaker" How was it? "Well ... Well ..." "Your wife just sold a skyscraper of 311 million euros, Óscar!" Yes! I told you! I told you, you want to spend the whole crisis making reforms. I told you!. "Fuck, I'm very proud of you, fuck!" "I love you". Well Alex, you a little bit more. Me too, honey. "How are you? What's up in Frankfurt? "Have you finished the meetings?" Yes, yes I went down to eat something in the hotel bar... "Oh, I'll leave you then." "I hear people.." No, wait. Can you close the speakerphone just a moment? Tell me, honey. I would like to have a child with you "You wouldn't like, at some point," that someone could say: 'Look at that skyscraper over there, my mom did it!". Yes, of course I'd like it. I love you so much. Me too. I thought you were not coming back. Where do you plan to go to throw the ashes? Alex. Far away, mom. Far away. Can we close the capote? So cigarettes are not consumed before smoking them. No, I need some air. Okay, fine, so I'll smoke it in two then. Do you smoke? How could the girl smoke, mom? Of course not. This generation eats lactose-free, gluten free and nobody smokes here, but I do smoke. Let me take a drag. Katia, over there. Do you really tell me that you want to go to La Albufera? I really do. Why, Alex? Someone will have to tell to that lady that her lover has died. What lady? Oscar's lover. But you don't have to tell anyone anything, what the fuck are you saying. I'll have to say it because she may be waiting for a call or they discussed or I do not know and she has the right to know it too. I can call her and tell her. How are you going to tell her on the phone? Well, as they told you, Why would a mistress be more considerate? If Alex doesn't know why he committed suicide, maybe she does. He had no problems with Alex, but maybe it's not the same with the lover. The same with Alex did have problems because he went every Thursday to fuck another... But don't you realize that you can't go! They give you clubs and you go for more like a fool. Come on, really ... Leave it now! Go straight and that's it. No, I'm going to turn around. No, you're not going to turn around. Right now. If you're going to turn around, stop! I turn around! For the car, fuck! Alex, where are you going? Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex go back to the car! Alex! Alex! Alex, I will not leave you alone! Go back to the car! Katia leave me alone! Where are you going? Alex! Alex! Leave me alone! Leave me! Leave me! Alex... I know that you have come all of a sudden, but you should try to overcome it without losing your head, please. And how is that done, Katia? Tell me. Because, as far as I know, my husband would never have committed suicide, but maybe that hippie that put me the horns and smoked joints, maybe he would have. You know? Because I... don't know who he is. Forget the horns, that doesn't matter anymore. It won't matter to you, you spend your life foraging married men, but I do care, because I was his wife. We are not talking about me right now. Do not be unfair. Well tell me something worthwhile, Katia. Because right now, I can only think that my whole life was a lie, you know? Who was Oscar? Tell me, you were his friend. Who was my husband? a "fucker", a beach flirt, a compulsive fucker...? Who was he? You liked women, right, Oscar? Well here you're going to be you son of a bitch. Very well. Seeing chicks in bikini, watching their tits to the guiris! Glued to the skin of their thighs! Fuck! Fuck you don't do this. You don't do this. Listen to me, you have to be strong, my love. You have to have all the strength, you will be able to. I have to talk to her. I have to talk to her. I'm a little tired. I'm going to bed. I need to talk to her. But what are you going to tell her? That Oscar has committed suicide. Because of her whim of fuck my husband, she has ruined me. This shit is so big that I am not even able to cry the death of the person that mattered the most to me. I want her to look me in the face.. and let her know that I was his wife. Are you ok? I'm sorry, it's just.. I was taking a walk through the reeds and I heard you screaming and.. I'm sorry. Sometimes I need to scream to unclog me. They gave me a shitty news and I wanted to.. take it out but.. but it doesn't work. It's stuck here.. and it doesn't go away. The love of my life has died. I guess I have to wait untill it leaves. What happens is that... I'm going to miss him a lot. We have been together many years. Tristán. I' sorry. How many years? Eight. Eight years. Sorry, I'm telling you all this and I don't even know who you are. Martina. I'm Veronica. What are you doing here? [CAMI] :)
