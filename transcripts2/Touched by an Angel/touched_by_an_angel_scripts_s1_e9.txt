 Don't you just love the way the sun pours through? But they got the nose all wrong. Well, they did their best. People have been painting pictures and writing songs and making movies about heaven and all, ever since they could breathe. And they never come close. Poor love. It gets so dusty up here. ♪ Mm-hmm, oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Mm-hmm, love that sky ♪

 Now, Serena's music, that comes pretty close to the real thing. Yeah, she and Johann Sebastian have a lot in common. You give them a little glimpse of heaven and they're off and singing. But some people, you can put heaven right smack in front of them and they still can't see anything to sing about. Thanks, Wayne, I forgot that. Think, Joey. Well, why don't you come with us? I have to go to work, you know that. But... Joey, I'll see you at 5:00.

 Well, come back before 5:00, 'cause it gets dark at 5:00. You got to stop this, you know it? Come on, Joey. We're going to be late. So he's afraid of the dark, huh? The only light in that little boy's life is his friend. But light is a powerful thing, baby. And the light from that little girl is going to reach into all the dark corners of Joey's life. It's going to strengthen his faith. It's going to illuminate his brother's soul. That light has got to shine brighter than it's ever shown before.

Ah, just keep going, I'll get everything. I can't keep going, fool. And we're not waiting on you, we're waiting on this old, broken down... Excuse me. We're from the Seraphim Organ Service. We didn't call any service. You should check with the pastor. Deacon Jamison, did Pastor Mike mention anything to you about organ service? Mm-mm. But this is covered by a service agreement. But this organ's 100 years old. Ah, but it was a lifetime guarantee. Well, you're too late. No, I hope not. It's going to be a beautiful Christmas pageant. Except now, there's no music. Oh, you just leave that to us. Okay, folks. Shepherds, back to the field; wise men, places. Uh, the shepherds were over here, and the wise men were over there. Back, by the altar. No, they were to the west of the manger, and Balthasar was in the front. Say what? There was Balthasar, there was Melchior and there was Gaspar. And the shepherds were just sort of... cowering right about here. Is this from your imagination or from memory? Honey, you'd be surprised what I can remember. Well, sister, if you think you know what's happening, then why don't you just lead the band? Well, if you insist. All right, uh, wise men go over there, shepherds come over here. And get closer together. Altos, not so high. Here, let me help you with that. These things can be tricky. Thanks. Oh, you're going to make a beautiful angel, Serena. I can't wait. Okay, you can go home now, Mommy. Why, sweetheart? It's a surprise. You can't see it until it's real. Well... Please, Mommy? Okay. When should I come get you? Can Serena come to my house? Yeah, I'll go home with Joey. Yeah, and we can make macaroni, 'cause she makes really good macaroni, and I promise I'll take really, really good care of her. I know you will, Joey. Say hi to Wayne for me. I'll pick you up tonight at Joey's. Okay. Places, please. Are you sure you've done this before? Oh, it's going to be just like being there. Give me the notes. Now, choir, we're going to do this a cappella until I can get this organ in shape. Better be in shape by Sunday night. Just give me the notes. ♪ Hallelujah... ♪ You can sit down. ♪ Hallelujah... ♪ Come on. You mean this is going to be at night? Sunday night at 7:00. And maybe you can get your brother to come. Come on now. ♪ Hallelujah ♪ Choir, we're going to have to have a little more feeling. And shepherds... I want you to think "awe." A heavenly host has just appeared before you. I want you to think "wonder." Think "awe." Awe. Awe. Yeah, yeah, that's good, that's good. Action. "And lo, there were, in the same country, "shepherds keeping watch over their flocks by night. "And behold, an angel of the Lord stood by them "and the brightness of God "showed round about them, "and they were greatly afraid. And the angel said unto them..." Fear not, for I bring you good tidings of great joy, that shall be unto all people. Serena? Serena! Serena! Harry, bring her down. I can't. That's it. That's it. You got her? Oh, piece of cake. Good job, Harry. I can't breathe. Oh, here, give her some air, give her some air. I was scared, Serena. I was scared. You're going to be all right, honey. You want me to call your folks? I'm okay. It's going to work, isn't it? Oh, sure. I'm not going to let you down, honey. I got to fly. She has to be the angel. Oh, you'll fly, honey, 'cause you're the only angel we got. Yeah. That rope scared me. I know, Joey. But I'll be okay. I don't think you should go onto that rope 'cause it's too scary. I have to, Joey. It's my only chance to be an angel. Well, you can do it next year. I'll be too big by then, Joey. I have to do it now. What do you mean the pipes are dirty? I mean they're dirty. A whole lot of hot air has been blown through those things. Serena, look what you forgot. Mr. Beans! Thanks. Is someone coming to give you two a ride home? Yeah, before it gets dark, 'cause I have to be home before it gets dark. It's not getting dark, is it? No, not yet. Wayne's coming to pick you up, right? I think so. I said, "I'll see you before it gets dark." Oh, I can't remember. What if it gets dark and he doesn't come? I have to be home before it gets dark. It's not that he's afraid of the dark, he just doesn't like it very much. Why don't I give you a ride home, Joey? And Tess can wait here just in case your brother shows up. You see that big, red boat over there? That's my car. And not everybody gets a chance to ride in that. Wow. It's hard, sometimes, Tess. Knowing the what but not always knowing the why. Knowing more than human beings, and less than God. When life keeps you in the dark, baby, that's when you start looking at the stars. Come on, Serena! Come on! Come on! Hey, Wayne! Hey, Wayne, I'm home. Don't pick me up. What are you doing here? I just beat the dark. I was just coming to get you. What if I'd missed you, huh? Why don't you ever listen to me? Well, Monica gave me a ride, Wayne. Thanks. Hi, Wayne. Hey, Serena. Joey and I are going to make some macaroni. Okay? Okay. Come on, let's go. Uh, would you like to come in? I'd love to. Could I get you something? Ah, no, thanks. Hey, Wayne. Wayne, the stable fell over. Can you fix it? 'Cause you got lots of wood and hammers and stuff. Come on, Joey. Let's go. Come on. I have a lumberyard in town. Uh-huh. You don't mind me asking, what are you doing around here? I'm working on the organ at the church. Oh. I hadn't been there in a few years. That old thing still pumping? Just barely. We're hoping to have it fixed in time for the pageant. Are you going? No, I'm not a Christmas kind of guy. Everybody loves Christmas. Well, we keep it kind of low-key around here. What do you mean? We don't make a big deal out of it. When our folks were alive, you know, our mom went all-out every year. But I don't have time for that stuff. What about St. Patrick's Day, or the Fourth of July, do you celebrate those? You know what I celebrate? Serena, you got everything you need? Everything's under control. I celebrate every day that goes by that Joey doesn't break something, or spill something, or rip something, or hug somebody too hard, or scream his lungs out 'cause it gets dark when he wasn't looking. That's what I celebrate. And when it happens, it usually doesn't last that long. Thank God for Serena. At least she takes him off my hands once in a while. She doesn't let anybody tease him or hurt him. She's probably the only person that can really handle him. And maybe that's something to celebrate. Wayne, I learned something about Serena today that I think you should know. Her heart, right? I heard about it. Some sort of defect. It's a viral disease. It's incurable. Do I put it in here? But I thought it was just a childhood thing you grow out of. Well, some children live longer than others, but in Serena's case... Joey is going to lose his best friend very soon. Just kidding. You tuning? I'm testing. Oh. Well, look, nobody touches that organ except me. My Grandma Edna played it, my mother Edna played it and this Edna plays it. It's an Edna thing. How can I fix this organ if I can't try it out? Well, you can fix it. I just don't want you lingering, you know what I mean. I have it on very good authority, that angels don't normally carry dolls. Mr. Beans is not a doll. Well, maybe Mr. Beans could qualify as a cherub. What's that? A baby angel. Mr. Beans is not a baby. He's older than I am. In fact, I promised him that he could fly with me. An angel keeps her promises, doesn't she? Always. I don't know about this pulley. It seems dangerous. Serena's got her heart set on it, you know? You can't give children everything they want, Harry. That's right, I can't give her everything she wants. I can't give her a healthy heart. I can't give her another year to live. I can't even give her another month. But I can give her Christmas. Hallelujah, hallelujah... ♪ That sounds horrible. Well, they're just rehearsing. In the end, it will sound... it'll sound better. Can't they sing "Silent Night"? That's my favorite. That's my favorite, too. We'll sing "Silent Night" at the pageant. Well, I'm not going to-to the pageant. What? Oh, Joey, you've got to come to the pageant. You've done so much to make it happen. Well, no one told me when it is. Don't you know when it is? You mean because it's going to be at night, right? Don't worry, Joey. We'll figure out something. Why isn't Wayne here? It's getting dark. I can't go outside when it's dark. Joey, what is it about the nighttime that frightens you? People that go out at night don't come back. Hey, Joey, ready to go? You're late. I'm sorry. I had a big order to get out. And I have to get back down there, so let's go. No, no; it's dark. I can't go. I don't have time for this tonight, now. We'll hop in the truck, we'll be home before you know it. Excuse me, Wayne, I think if you just give Joey a minute... Excuse me. I've been giving Joey a minute for years. We go through this all the time. Now, let's go, Joey. No! No! No, Wayne. Damn it. Come on, Joey. What's wrong with you? No! No! No, Wayne! No, I don't want to go! Please, don't make me go! Joey? Go like this. Come on. Come on. Now, you see? It's not really like, you know, night out there, or dark or anything. It's sort of like "Silent Night." ♪ All is calm, all is bright. ♪ Get it? All is bright. Okay, now hold on. Watch your step. You haven't told him about Serena yet, have you? No. I don't know what he'll do without her. Or what I'll do. I'm mad at my mind. It forgot to tell me to get glue. I need to get some glue and put it into my jacket so I can have some for tomorrow. Sure. Joey, sit down. We need to talk. No. Let's talk after we get glue. It'll only take a minute. I have to tell you something. No, no. We have to go. No, you have to hear this first. No... No, no, Wayne. What's wrong with you? Last time you said that, it was about Mom and Dad. Joey... They went out into the dark and weren't coming back and weren't coming back and you said, "Sit down, I need to talk to you." Sometimes things are hard to hear, Joey. But I need to talk to you again. No! No! No! No! No! Fine. ♪ King of kings ♪ ♪ And Lord of lords ♪ ♪ King of kings ♪ ♪ And He shall reign ♪ ♪ For ever and ever ♪ ♪ And ever ♪ ♪ For ever and ever, and ever ♪ ♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah... ♪ Cut it. ♪ Hallelu... ♪ Cut! Cut! ♪ ...jah! ♪ That sounded better, didn't it? It sounded good to me. How'd it sound to you out there? Stunning. Uh, truly, joyful noise onto the Lord. Oh, my narration sounded better, this time, didn't it, Tess? Did you like the little thing I added? Petting the cow? We're getting there. We're really getting there. So take five and I'll have some notes for you. Serena, can we go now, before it gets dark? Okay, Joey. Hey, silly, you forgot to take off your halo. I like it. It could be my hat. Hey, Joey, let's make angels. I don't know. It's okay, we'll be to your house before you even know it. Okay. Whee! I'm sorry about yesterday, Serena. I made myself embarrassed. That's okay, Joey. We're all afraid of something. What do you do when you're scared? I close my eyes, try to be very quiet. Serena? Are you okay? Are you okay? Okay, let's get you home. Hold on, Serena. Hold on. Hold on. Okay. Hold on. Almost there. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Wayne! Wayne! Help! Wayne! Take her in your room, put her on the bed. Okay. What do we do? What do we do? I don't know. You got to help her, Wayne. I don't know, Joey. Get out of here. Go to the porch and watch for her mom and dad. I called an ambulance, too. Help her, Wayne! Get out of here, Joey. Go! I don't know what to do. Serena? Serena? Come on, now, don't you die on me. Serena? God... what can I do? You know, I'm glad you two are here. I thought she'd appreciate a familiar face or two. Serena, baby. This is our friend Adam. He's come to take you to Heaven, very soon. It's going to be a beautiful trip, Serena. You won't feel any more pain. Yes, that's right. There's going to be some tough times between now and then, but your angels are here with you now and you will not be alone. Fear not, my little angel. Her favorite song is "Silent Night." ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ Dear God... ♪ All is calm... ♪ This is Joey. My heart wants to tell you something. Please, please, don't let Serena go into the dark... 'cause if she goes to Heaven, who's going to love me? ♪ Holy infant, so tender and mild... ♪ Please help. Love, Joey. ♪ Sleep in heavenly ♪ ♪ Peace... ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace. ♪ Honey... look who's here. Hi, Serena. Don't forget, Joey, we have to be very still and gentle. Okay, okay... Shh. Hi... How come you have a new bed? You don't have to whisper. How come you have a new bed? Well, I have to lie here for awhile. Your Mom says if you just wait awhile someone's going to give you a new heart and then everything will be okay. I don't think so, Joey. What? The other day, I saw angels. Monica and Tess, the organ ladies? They're real angels. No! Real angels?! Well, they don't look like angels. They did when I saw them. They're beautiful, Joey. I-I want to see the angels. You have to do something for me, Joey, okay? Okay. Promise? Okay. Okay, I promise. You have to take good care of Mr. Beans for me. Mr. Beans? Wh-Where is he? I think I... left him in the snow. Uh-oh. You have to take him to the Christmas Pageant tonight, okay? I promised him that he could fly. No, no. No. No, see, you're going to be the angel. You're going to take him up and fly like an angel. I'm afraid I can't do that, Joey. But you can. No... no, I can't. It's going to be at night. It's going to be dark there. I can't do it. You have to come with me. It's okay. But you see, I can't take you through the dark anymore, Joey. You have to do it all by yourself. No, no, no... You can do it. Fear not. Excuse me... Have you seen the angel? Have you seen Mr. Beans? Have you seen him? Have you seen Mr. Beans? No. No. Let's go! No... No, no. Dear... Dear God, This is Joey again, and, uh... I have a p-problem. I'm so scared. Serena is so s-sick. And I can't find Mr. Beans. I prom... promised her that he could fly. And the Christmas pageant is at night and I ca-can't go. That's an awful lot to be afraid about all at once, Joey. Are you an angel? 'Cause Serena says that you're an angel. Yes, I am. You don't look like an angel. Well, sometimes I do. I made a mess. Yes, you did. But I understand why. Wayne, he's going to kill me. No. I'll talk to him. Serena's going... to-to Heaven. Yes, she is. I'm going to miss her. Because I'm going to be all alone. Oh, no. No, you won't be alone. You'll have Wayne. Wayne hates me. Joey? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Wayne, before you say... What the hell do you think you were doing? Do you have any idea what you've done? You know what you've done? Wayne, please, would you just listen? Listen to her, Wayne. She's an angel. Shut up, Joey! It's a mess over there. You're lucky they're not going to arrest you. He was frightened. He reacted the only way he knows how. That's no excuse. Yes, it is. He's your brother. He needs some understanding. Who the hell do you think you are? She's an angel. This whole place is nuts. I'm sorry, Wayne. You don't leave this house. Do you hear me? And you, get out of my house. If I stay inside, I guess I can't go to the pageant. There's not going to be a pageant. I'm sorry, Wayne. I'm sorry. Wayne? We're closed. How's Joey doing? He's not. He can't sit still. He barely talks. He walks around the kitchen counting spoons. He's in a lot of pain. And he thinks you're an angel. It's true. No, it's not. And I'd appreciate it if you'd just stay away from Joey. Joey needs hope from someone. What the hell does he have to hope for? He has you. Don't remind me. Joey needs you. All Joey does is need me. He can't even button his shirt without needing me. When I get angry, I ask God for patience. Now, what did God ever do for me? He gave me a brother like Joey and then took my parents. So I'm stuck with him. Ask God for patience, huh? It was God who did this to me. That's not how God works. Really. Oh, yeah, yeah, I forgot: You're an angel. You know these things. Joey's my friend. Joey's everybody's friend. Trouble is, he's nobody's responsibility except mine. Responsibility is a privilege. You have been entrusted with a beautiful soul who loves you, who's loyal to you, who'll never hurt you. Why won't you love Joey? He thinks that you hate him. You know... when I was a kid, I used to pray for a little brother. And when I finally got one, well... every morning, I'd wake up expecting a miracle. Hoping I'd walk through the door, he'd be at the breakfast table all fixed, fine. But a miracle never happened and I stopped believing in them. Joey really needs you now, Wayne. He's losing Serena and he knows that an-and when he loses her, he-he's gonna lose the faith that has kept him going. You're talking to the wrong man. I got no faith left. You help Joey find his and I promise you, you'll find yours. Oh, hi, Wayne. Hello. Sorry about all this, deacon. Oh, well, don't worry about it, Wayne. The boy was hurting. The truth is, he did what most of us wanted to. You know, I was thinking that I could put a hand to those and get them fixed up for the pageant. That's sweet, but there's not going to be a pageant, Wayne. I mean, I think we were all just doing it for Serena's sake in the first place. Well, then isn't that a good enough reason to do it now? Maybe Serena can't be there, but promises were made. Shouldn't they be kept? Well, the organ still isn't fixed, you know. Did you hear that? Did I fix that sucker or what? Joey? I need to apologize to you. I'm really sorry. I know you're hurt inside and I know you're worried about Serena. She's going to Heaven. We don't know that for sure. Hopefully somebody's going to give a new heart real soon. I don't think so. You have to have hope, because she is your best friend. She's been a lot better friend to you than I have. She never tried to change you... and, Joey, I'm not going to try to change you anymore... 'cause I love you just the way you are. Where you going with-with your suit on? To the Christmas pageant. But I-I broke everything. I know it. But I put it back together. It looks pretty awful, but it's standing. Would you like to go? I know it's awful dark out there and... I'll just tell everybody you said hello, okay? Hello, Joey. Merry Christmas. Wayne is at church. I know. It's Christmas Eve and he's gone to the pageant. Why don't you come? No. No. I can't. I know that it's dark out here, but... you did make a promise, didn't you? Do you remember the promise that you made to Serena? But I lost him. I can't keep the promise, 'cause I lost Mr. Beans. Sometimes it takes a lot of courage to keep a promise. Serena knows that you have courage. You've already been through the darkest place you can imagine.
