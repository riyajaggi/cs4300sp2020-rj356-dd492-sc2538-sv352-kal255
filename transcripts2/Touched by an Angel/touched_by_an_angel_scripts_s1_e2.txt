 That's good. That's good. Just level it out. I think I'm getting the hang of it now. Oh, it just takes a little practice. Just relax and let go. Okay. Ah, shoot. Oh, don't worry about it. You'll have it when you need it. Are you sure this is how it's done?

 You are speaking to the angel who told the Babe which way to point. And you know who kept Kirk Gibson in that locker room till he was ready to hit that home run? Now keep your eye on the ball and line up your knuckles. Fire away. Yes! Yes! Yes! Way to go! Good stuff! Whoo! Heads up! Heads up! I got it! I got it! All right! Okay, come on. Hustle!

 Bring it in! Get around! Come on, Dink. Get off your heels. Come on, Dink. Take it to it. Come on, Dink. This isn't a putting green. You call yourself a ballplayer? Huh? Do ya? Do ya? Can't hear ya! Yes. Let's go. Put some pop in that bat. Drive that ball. Let's go. Come on, gang! Yeah, man, come on. Get some pop in that bat. Get off your heels, Dink. Let's go. Bring it home. Bring it home. Oh, for God's sakes. I can't take this. You're hopeless. If you don't care about the game, son, let us know. Don't put the rest of us through this. Come on, now. What are you waiting for, an invitation? They're expecting you. This week, you'll be substituting for the history teacher. He's on jury duty. Perfect. I'll simply reminisce. And you'll also be covering his extracurricular responsibilities. He's the assistant baseball coach. Assistant coach to him? Uh-huh. Reset! Heads up! Oh, hold it, guys. Hold it. How can he hit the ball if it's thrown like that? You see that white thing in front of him, huh? That's the plate. 17 inches wide. Do you think you can get that ball over the plate? That's the idea of pitching. Pitch the ball over the plate. Come on, now. What do you say? He's got a temper the size of Montana, this coach. Oh, but the wind is changing. A mighty storm is rising. And the rains are about to fall hard on that man. And he's going to need an angel to hold the umbrella. Me. Don't back up on it. Tess, I know him. Yes, you do. That's why you're the angel for the job. Well... Earl, it's nice to see you again. Heads up! See, I told you you'd have it when you needed it. You trying to kill somebody, Dink? Damn metal bats. I guess it's time to play ball, huh? ♪ ♪ ♪ When you walk down the road ♪ ♪ Heavy burden, heavy load ♪ ♪ I will rise ♪ ♪ And I will walk with you ♪ ♪ I'll walk with you ♪ ♪ Till the sun don't even shine ♪ ♪ Walk with you ♪ ♪ Every time, I tell you, I'll walk with you ♪ ♪ Walk with you ♪ ♪ Believe me, I'll walk with you. ♪ You all right? You okay? I'm really sorry. It's okay. I'm fine, really. What a catch. Lucky catch. I don't believe in luck. That's an awfully solid swing you have there. Oh, don't encourage him, lady. It seems to me that encouragement goes a lot farther with a person than yelling. Losers get encouraged. Winners get coached. Come on, guys. That's funny. I thought you caught a lot more fleas with honey. Flies. Flies. Well... you do it your way, I'll do it mine. Don't mind if I do. May I? Thank you. It's Dink, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Well, come on with me, Dink. Hey, guys, check it out! Which one of those sweet little boys is yours? You can spot a proud mother a mile away, I guess. It's Peter... Peter Enloe. And I'm Laura. My name is Tess, and that's my friend, Monica. If you could recommend a place in this town where an honest woman could get a T-bone steak, I sure would be grateful. Well, as a matter of fact, I run a sports bar right off the highway. Best steaks in the county. No! Isn't that interesting that I found you just in time? When you get frustrated, you take your head out of the game. And you have to keep it in. So, just relax... shoulders back. Keep your weight on your back leg. Nice easy swing. You know you're good. Just let it happen. Oh, and line up your knuckles. All right! The Dinkman! Base hit. Good swing, Dink. All right, Enloe, get in here. Now, don't think... don't relax... just do it. Ah! Yes! That one's going to need a passport. All right, let's see what the other ballerinas can do. Let's go! Are you a parent or a relative or something? No. But we've met before, right? Do I look familiar? Look, see... See, we get a lot of baseball freaks around here... People want to put their two cents in... And all it does is jam the kids' minds, so... don't interfere. This is a private practice, players and coaches only. I know. So... You know that new assistant coach? The one who's substituting for the history teacher? No way. What do you want me to say? I asked the county for somebody who was qualified in baseball and history and her name was at the top of the list. As a matter of fact, Earl, she was the only one available. It's unacceptable. Well, you're going to have to accept it. What's the matter with you lately? You're a lot meaner than usual. Big game Friday. We going to win? You know why you're not a coach, Artmeir? 'Cause you got to ask. Showers, guys. Come on, move it. Enloe... in my office. Yeah, Coach? This won't take long. Shut the door. I'm making you team captain. Wow! "Wow"? "Wow" is no answer. Come on, Peter. Be more articulate. Thanks, Coach. I can do it. Don't jerk my chain, son. You're the best ballplayer in four counties and you would've been ticked if you hadn't made team captain. It's a big responsibility... all those cheerleaders to fight off. But you can handle it. I can. One more thing. Sit down. Friday's game against West. We're gonna win, no problem. You have to do better than win, Peter. The baseball scout I told you about, my old buddy from the Army? He's scouting for Southern Colorado now. He'll be here Friday for the game. Oh, that's great! He's got a freshman spot available at Southern. And I told him all about you. Yeah? The problem is he's going to be checking out this kid from West High for the same spot. Whoever he likes gets the full scholarship and all that goes with it, so... you got to do more than win. Understand? Yes, sir, I do. You got to play like your life depends on it. 'Cause it does. Yeah! Yeah... Glasses here. Seltzer, soda, beer. You have worked as a bartender, right? Hmm... honey, you know the martini? You know the olive? You know that little red thing in the middle? That was my idea, the little red thing. Well, I sure could use the help. But the pay is low. You just keep cookin' them T-bone steaks. I am very happy. My husband loved those, too. Must be hard without him. It is. Especially the parent part. Sometimes I lie awake at night and wonder: did I say the right thing to my son? Should I have let him do this? Should I have said no to that? What would Frank have done? He would be doing the same things you're doing. I don't know. Truth is, I'm much too easy on Peter. I think he gets his discipline from baseball. You saw the coach today, right? Saw, heard, and experienced him. I know Earl's a lot to take at first. But he is the local hero. Captain of the varsity team the year we took state. First kid from this town to get an athletic scholarship. First guy I knew around here to actually have a future bigger than working the factory. Of course, a Purple Heart changed all that. He's turned pretty bitter losing his shot. But he still knows how to win. And somebody like that... taking an interest in my boy? Well, it gives Peter a chance, you know? Another round, barkeep! Two drafts and a cranberry juice coming up. Thank you. Well, if it isn't Tommy Lasorda. Good evening, Coach. You know, you don't strike me as the cranberry juice type. I'm in training. Really? You said you got a job, but a barkeeper? Well, she didn't need a stripper. Hi, Monica. Oh, hello. Have you told her? Not yet. I have an announcement to make. Cut the music! Can I stand up on this? Coach, after Friday, you can have that bench. Thank you. All right, I have a toast I want to make. Peter, get over here. Come on. Everybody raise 'em up. Everybody lift 'em. Here we go. Hey, Coachette, what the hell is that? It's the best I can do on short notice. What? What did you say? It's the best I could do on short notice. Come on, Earl. Make your toast. Yeah, tonight... I want to toast this great kid. Hard work, skill, determination... And great coaching. You're damn straight. Peter Enloe has accomplished what most of you losers here can only dream of. He's about to get a scholarship, and a ride out of this dead-end, one-horse town. Now, Friday, this kid's going to play the game of his life, right? Huh? And I want all of your butts in the bleachers to cheer him on! Here we go! Hold it. You got to drink what you toast, or it doesn't work. Well... oh, now, Coach, don't tell me you're superstitious? Malicious is more like it. Hey, Coachette, drink what you toast. It's a tradition. You're not going to be rude, now, are you? Bottoms up. Hold it! Step back. Peter... May the road rise before you, may your swing be straight, may the ball fly high and far, and may God himself bring you home. Oh, come on, Franco. This is baseball we're playing here. If you can't get that into that pea brain of yours there's an opening on the girls' flag team. Sorry, coach. Stand over there. Now, watch me. Here you go. Your weight back, your hands loose, loose grip, sit to hit. What the hell is this? It was the best I could do on short notice. All right, Coachette. Let's take some infield. May I? Bats are over there. No one uses that bat but the coach. His father gave it to him after he hit his first home run. He hit a grand slam with it in division finals, won a state championship with it. He's always got it. And he'll probably die with it. Here. Here's a good one. Thank you. All right, guys, look alive. Let's hustle. Third base. That's it. That a babe. Come on now. Damn it, Dink. You know, I'm going to change your name from Dink to Stink 'cause you stink, son. Then you stand there with that goofy look on your face. The play isn't over because you made an error. It's what you do after you miss the ball. Get the ball! Hustle! Peter! Yeah, coach? You're the captain. How many laps do you think it'll take Mr. Whitten here before he learns to hustle? I don't know. A couple? A couple, he won't break a sweat. Uh... five? Five, my grandmother wouldn't break a sweat. He was trying, Coach. He was. I saw him. Take it easy, Coachette. Now, you're not getting soft on Stinky here because he's your friend, are you? He's a man. He can take it. If you're a man, you can dish it out. Now, let me give you a hint. We're talking double-digits here. Ten. Ten! Ten, the captain said. Ten unforgettable laps. Hustle. Come on, now! Reset! Sometimes I hate him so much I could kill him. You pickin' daisies? Stand up. Let's get in the game! All right. He asks Peter... Peter-- To decide how many laps to give him. The man is impossible. I can't change him. Of course not. That's not your job. Will you go easy on that? I think I'm starting to like it. So what is my job? I mean, if he needs an umbrella, why doesn't it rain? Tess, why doesn't something happen? It's been raining all along. You just haven't noticed. The storm is on the inside. Hi, Coach. Here for dinner? Yeah, whatever you got. Coach. What can I do you for? Uh... Cranberry juice. Hitting the sauce a little hard, are we? Thanks. Can I ask you a question? Because it works. Hard on the kids because it works. It has to work or they lose. You know... they let down their guard for one minute or they get sloppy for an instant, that's the opening the enemy is waiting for and bingo, they're dead. But this is baseball. These are kids playing against kids. Not the enemy. No difference. Today it's baseball. Someday it'll be something else. The kids have got to learn to fight to win a in job, or... Or in a war? So that's how it happened... in the war. You got sloppy and you got hurt? Are you really trying to save these kids from the same thing? Or do you just need to make someone pay for it? Enloe? Yeah, Coach? Your friend do all his laps today? Yeah. Good. I expect him to do five more before tomorrow's practice. Unless that'll upset you too much. You got too much riding on Friday's game. So if Dink doesn't shape up, Captain, you're going to have to kick him off the team. "To be or not to be, that is the question "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind "to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune "or to take arms against the sea of troubles and by opposing end them." Now, who can give me an example from history of someone who faced this dilemma whether to fight back or not? Jennifer? The Boston Tea Party. Excellent. Dumping the tea to protest the king's unfair tax was a brave risk. It started the Revolution, not to mention the harbor smelled of Earl Grey for weeks. Another one. Rosa Parks... refused to move to the back of the bus. Good. Sometimes we have to stand up and fight for what we believe in, and sometimes it takes even more courage to stay put, to hold your ground and refuse to be bullied. That doesn't always stop it. No, it doesn't change the bully, but it changes you. Okay, that's it for today. Okay, let's go. Tomorrow we play West. They're good. They're tough. And if they win, guys, they go to division, not you. So I need a team of fighters, not crybabies. Come on, now. Stretch, Watkins, or you'll be doing laps like Stinky here. What? Did you do your five laps for your captain today, Dinkman? I didn't tell him. What? I didn't tell him. I didn't make him run. Get over here, Enloe. I gave you an order. Well, I'm the captain, and I say no. Well, I'm the coach, and I say ten. Both of you, now! I'm not going to be bullied. Fifteen! Why don't you kiss my... You watch what you're saying, Mister. Don't touch me! I'll do what I want. Peter! You're out of here, Mister. You can forget about Friday's game. The scout, the scholarship and the rest of your lousy life. Now you're off my team. Now get the hell off of my field before I show you what a real punch is. Now! Peter, no, no, don't do it. Coach... Get away! Coach! Are you all right? Peter, call an ambulance. Dr. Collins to Three West. Dr. Collins to Three West, please. How is he? I don't know. I... I didn't even think I hit him that hard. Is the young man here who punched Coach Rowley? That's me. Well, I won't go into the ethics of a young man punching out the coach, but I will tell you that, except for some redness and slight tenderness on Mr. Rowley's jaw, that's all you did to him. Then why did he fall down? I'm sorry. I can't discuss his condition with anyone beside family. He doesn't have any family. Well, I still need his consent. Then, can we see him? No, I'm sorry. He doesn't want any visitors. Maybe we should all go home. We'll see him tomorrow. I think that's a good idea. Ortho Tech to Pediatrics. Ortho Tech to Pediatrics. I'll catch up with you in a minute, okay? It's time, Monica. I've come for the coach. Tonight? Soon. I don't understand, Adam. He looked fine. Pancreas. Doesn't start to really show until the final phase. And he fought me the whole way. Started exercising. He stopped drinking. He just wouldn't give up. Man's a real fighter. Oh, I know. How you doing, Coach? That's a stupid question. Well, technically, it's meant to be a kind of a... an ice-breaker. You don't intimidate easily, do you? Could you cower a little just to humor me? It's okay to be scared, you know? I've been scared once in my life, and this is not it. I know. It was raining that day. When I hit the dirt today, I had this flashback thing. Before I went out, it all came back to me in one second. The rain, the war, the blood. We had taken terrible losses, and the rain was turning everything into mud. Then I heard this lieutenant say the most horrible word I ever heard: "advance." So, we charge up this hill. I'm shooting as fast I can, and, uh... this guy pops up in front of me not ten yards away... Same size, same age... Just in a different uniform, that's all. And I let my guard down for one second. For one second, I saw how ridiculous war is. And in that one second, he shot first. And I'm laying there in the mud... in the rain... bleeding to death. I start crying and, uh... "This is it. "I'm gonna die. Oh, God, don't let me die alone." And then... then, there you were, all in white. You're not getting wet. You're not getting dirty. You bandage me up, and you say... "It's the best I could do On short notice." You're... you're an angel, aren't you? So, what am I supposed to do now, thank you, is that it? What do you mean? What did you save my life for if I couldn't get to live it? I had a future to go home to. Baseball was my life. I was supposed to be somebody, and what am I? A limping has-been, never-was high school baseball coach. A big fish in a stinking little hometown pond. You want to know why I saved your life? Because there was something you were supposed to do with it. You were supposed to share it. You could have let your guard down every day for the rest of your life, and sent 100 boys to college. You could have let your guard down and put your arms around a thousand Dinks and told them they were okay. But what did you choose to do with the gift? Oh! You spent your life thinking about what you'd lost, making sure that you'd never let your guard down again. Never letting anybody in. Now it's too late. You see, because you're going to die even more alone than you ever were before. I told you he needed an umbrella, but I didn't tell you to hit him on the head with it. I know. I got angry. Well, anger's not so bad. You just got to be careful where you put it. So, now you're sitting out here contemplating the infinite, huh? And what it takes to run it. I can't see the plan, Tess. I know I'm supposed to do something, but I don't know what. He said so many awful things. You see, that anger is clouding your brain. Forget what he said. What did you hear? I heard fear. Fear that his life has been a waste. He knows that he's dying, and he knows that he's dying by himself. Oh, honey, we all die by ourselves. It's living by ourselves that hurts. What is he leaving behind that will last? I don't know. Some of our best living is done through the people we leave behind. Does he believe that? I don't know what he believes. ♪ The Lord moves in mysterious ways ♪ ♪ His wonders to perform ♪ ♪ He plants His footsteps on the sea ♪ ♪ And He rides on every storm ♪ ♪ But He is His own interpreter ♪ ♪ And He's gonna make it plain... ♪ Don't worry, baby. ♪ The Lord moves in mysterious ways ♪ ♪ His wonders to perform ♪ ♪ He plants His footsteps on the sea ♪ ♪ And He rides on every storm ♪ ♪ Mm-mm-mmm, the Lord moves in mysterious ways... ♪ Peter, you're back on the team, and you're playing tomorrow. But the coach... I'm acting on behalf of the coach. He's okay, then? He's going to be. That's wonderful news. To tell you the truth, I was pretty worried. I honestly didn't know what we were going to do if the coach kept him out of that game. But he'll be there tomorrow, right? We'll see. Is he okay? Don't worry. Go home and get some rest. I'll see you at home. What is Earl trying to do? Laura, the coach is dying. Oh, my God. Did Peter...? No, no, it had nothing to do with Peter. He'd been ill for months, but he kept it hidden. He is a proud man. Then he didn't put Peter back on the team, did he? That was you. Peter needs his chance. But the chance means nothing unless it comes from the coach. The coach has brought him this far. He's got to take him the rest of the way. Then you must go to him. Talk to him. Hello, Earl. Laura. It's not as bad as it looks. No, of course not. Monica's put Peter back in tomorrow's game. I'd have put money on that. She told Peter it was you. What difference does it make? The kid has his shot. Who cares where it came from? Peter cares. You two have had your problems, but whether you like it or not, you're the closest thing Peter has had to a father. Your approval still matters. And if you... If anything happens to you before my son can make amends with you, then winning that game tomorrow won't change Peter's life, but remembering your last words to him will. Hello. Oh, the angel of good cheer. I can't die alone if you're hanging around, you know. You told Laura, didn't you? Remember what you said, that your life was a waste, and that you were supposed to be somebody? This is not my idea of angels singing me to my rest. Well, you can still be somebody. You can. You can help that boy. It doesn't take a lifetime. It can take just a day. If you had it, would you take it, Earl? Would you? Adam... You'll have to step aside, Monica. I'm sorry. Ach, no. Adam, no. Please don't make this any harder. Mr. Rowley? Please, Adam, don't. It's not like this guy deserves another chance, you know. That's why he needs one. Tomorrow, then. You've got your chance, Coach. Now it's up to you. That's two for two! Got it! Heads up, guys. That's it! There you go! Come on! Come on! Second base. That's it! Tess, any last-minute pointers? Well, same thing I told the Babe: Hit far and run fast. That's it? Well, I never got any complaints out of him. Is he here? The scout? I will pray for his enlightenment. Okay, fellas, listen up. Today, we're really going to go out there a-a-and... a-a-and kick butt. But just in case we get kicked instead, I want each and every one of you to know that... that you're terrific. Well, that was inspiring. Play ball! Okay, let's go. Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go! Come on! Peter? He's a real bastard, you know that? I understand how you feel. I've never played a game without him here. Peter, that scout up in the stands is going to recognize your talent today. And you'll have to play 100 games without Coach Rowley. Today might just be the first of them. Batter up! Safe! He's outta there! Yes. Way to hustle, Peter. Great play! Safe. Nice try, Dink. Come on, come on! Go, go, go, go, go! Go home! You're out. I've lost it. Second base, second base! You're outta there! Go, baby, go, go, go! Safe! Ho-Hold up! Strike three. You're outta there. Come on, Peter. Time! Let's go, Peter. Bases loaded. Two outs. Run on anything. Play ball! Strike! The other boy the scout is considering? That's him. It's never simple, is it? Strike two. Take it easy, sweetheart. Relax, Enloe. You get frustrated, you take your head out of the game. Time, Blue? Time! I deserved that punch the other day. Yeah, I'm just sorry that I'm the one who had to give it to you. You know, I've been doing some thinking, and, uh, I've been pretty rough on you guys the last couple of weeks. I'm sorry. I don't want to hear it anymore. You do the right thing, you won't have to. Wait a minute. Give me that bat. Damn metal bats. Here you go, pal. Let's do it. All right, stick to it, Pete! Stick to it! All right! Here we go! Here, you're going to need a couple of swigs of this. Hot sauce... Pete, it's all yours! You got it. Let's play ball. Let's go. Nice and easy now, Peter. Swing! Yes! Home. Come on, baby. Come on. Stay, stay, stay! Home. Come home. Come home, kid. Bring it on home. Who loves you, baby? Safe! Yeah! Yes! Way to go, Peter. Did you do that for me, kid? Hell, no. Attaboy! Good boy you got there, Earl. Yeah, I told you so. You like Colorado, son? Yes, sir, I do. We'll see you in the fall. Thanks, Hank. Good hustle, Dink. Thanks, Coach. I do what I can. I didn't think I was going to make it without you here. Then I'm rounding those bases, the only thing I can hear is everybody telling me to stop. And then I hear you in my head telling me to go for it. Sorry about that. I'm not. I want you to know, every game I ever play I'm going to hear you in my head. Thanks for this. Yeah, hold on to that for a while, huh? I'll get it from you later. Charley Gehringer. Roger Maris. Tough to beat, but what about Ralph Kiner? Voice of the Mets. No, when he led the league seven years straight home runs. You're tough, pal. Hi. Hi. We're just getting acquainted. He's a big baseball fan, too. Ah, that doesn't surprise me. And I'm stalling for time, huh? You know, until last night, I was afraid of this... dying. Until last night, you weren't really living. Thank you, Monica. Batter up, Mr. Rowley. Earl Rowley, rounding third, heading for home. What do I do? Just let your guard down.
