 She'll be fine. Last season, the Old Etonians won the FA Cup because they were bigger than us, they were stronger than us, and they were faster than us. But we can pass the ball better than them. This season, I want us to use less forwards, more backs. We play a pyramid. Two fullbacks, three half-backs, and we keep five up top. We hit them on the break.

 But we always play six up front. There's no such thing as "always." Not in sport. Catch. Catch again. It's twice as heavy. So is a football when it's raining. Our game's about passing, but how can we do that accurately when the weight of the ball depends on the weather? We have to be able to adapt. So, let's practice with the ball both ways, and then we'll know how to adjust our game. You're a bloody genius, Fergus. Let's try it out against Brigg. Hmm?

 Let's play. Let's go wide. - Yeah, yeah. - I'm free. - And again, where's the man in space? - I'm open. There you go. Back in. Back in. Let's go, let's go. And again, let's go wide. Pass, move. Pass, move. Pass again. Man in space. Who's the man in space? We got space. - Make him some space. - Pass and move, boys. That's it! - Well played. - I'm open. Well played, boys. Keep that shape. Let's get that ball wide, boys. Let's get that ball wide. Fergus Suter's improved your team no end. Come to check out the competition? Anything to avoid the mill today. You saw cotton's taken another dive? It'll bounce back. Pass the ball, we move the ball. Very simple. Tommy. I hope you have better luck this season. Well played! Sir. The northern mill owners are on their knees. They're begging us to bail them out. Can we? The market is saturated. The price of cotton has collapsed. I don't see how we can expose our investors to such a risk. We need to understand the situation better. We need someone to go up there. Parker. How far north is it, exactly? I'll do it. I want to go. I'll stay with Monkey Hornby. He has cotton mills. He can be my guide. Hmm. Is there anywhere in the country where you don't have a football friend? Thank you, gentlemen. Mr. Stokes? I'm Mr. Parker, secretary to Lord Kinnaird. Right. How do? I do... well, thank you, but I'm afraid I can't find an appointment under your name. Oh, uh... I have no appointment. I see. - Parker. - Hold up. Mr. Kinnaird. I'm sorry, sir. Ted Stokes. I played for Darwen against your mob in the Cup last season. Oh, yes. What can we do for you, Mr. Stokes? Um... well... I need a loan. Um... I've done a proposal. Erm, I'm going to make shirts and sports jerseys of the finest Darwen cotton. As a footballer, I'm sure you would appreciate that, Mr. Kinnaird. I've worked it all out, numbers, figures, and the like. I know how it works. Yes, not perhaps entirely how it works. The thing is, I'm afraid I'm rather busy this morning. Oh, I see. Well, I don't need your answer right now. Did you come all the way down just to give this to me? I did, sir. We'll be in touch. Don't be unkind when you turn him down. You'd better pack evening dress. Ah, darling. We going somewhere? Blackburn. It's bank business. I shouldn't be more than a week. - I'm staying with Monkey and Ada. - I'll come with you. Darling, it'll just be endless meetings. I wouldn't inflict it on my worst enemy. Oh. Well, if you really... I'll be back before you know it. I'm ready to go. Let's hope we won't have to strike. We can fight these cuts. Good girl. Bye, love. Bye, Jenie. - Morning, Doris. - Morning. - Jimmy. - You will not believe how drunk I was last night. - Didn't even make it to my bed. - I noticed. I just fell asleep in there... on a chair. - Oh, did you now? - Oh, some post for you. Thank you. You gonna make an honest woman of her, Jim? What do you mean? How do you do it? How do you always know? Your voice goes all high-pitched and reedy when you lie. It never does! Yeah, but if we like a say in our lives, we must stand together. - We're stronger together than apart. - Yes. - We've got to show them we mean business. - Right you are, ma'am. With a five percent cut in wages, we won't survive. Otherwise, the bosses will take advantage of us. Ladies. They're trying to bring us to our knees. It's our right to belong to a union. It's our right to want representation. Right? Best way to bring folk together is by winning the FA Cup for them, right? Aye. That'd be one hell of a party. I don't want to strike any more than you, but our families are suffering. Apologize to Walsh for me. So you changed your mind about putting down roots, then? Have I? We'll see. We're being taken for granted. We must stick together. Mr. Walsh not mind you skiving off to walk me to work? If he tried to stop me, I'd quit on the spot. Get away. You'd never choose me over your precious football team. Aye, you're right. I'd rather win the FA Cup than walk you to work. But if it were more than just walking, - then I'm not so sure... - Stop it, Fergus. I've got to be careful. And not just for Jenie's sake, for mine too. Doesn't mean I have to like it. Don't pout. I'm not. And don't go getting... sacked by Walsh for skivving shifts. Now, go on. Get going. I'm late. - Betsy! - Don't say it. - I know it already. - Your shift started. Here, let me fix you. I know, I know. It won't happen again. Oh... you're showing. Go on. Without this loan from you, the mills will have to close. But if we extend the loan, what's going to stop us being back here in six months' time facing exactly the same problem? Perhaps your father could ask his political friends to enforce some price protection. - Thank you. - You exaggerate his influence. Besides, we support a free market. You must find ways to make new savings. Then, as chairman, I must propose another wage cut for the weavers. That will be the best way to make savings. Ten percent this time. No. My workers won't stand for it. If they're not happy, they're free to find employment elsewhere. Darwen is the mill. The football club and the mill, that's all there is. There's no place else for 'em. You have a real affinity with the working man, don't you, Walsh? You see, you say that as an insult, but I take it as a compliment. I propose another five percent cut. I'll need to study the figures. Members of the guild must abide by the majority decision. All those in favor of a ten percent cut. - Aye. - Aye. Aye. Aye. My sister's heard they're cutting our wages again. By ten percent this time. We don't even know it's true. She heard every word, clear as a bell. I'll do it. Is it true? Strike! Get those machines off! Off! Turn them off! They're cutting us ten percent! We're walking! Move! - Lads, we're with ya! - Come on, son. We're walking! Well, go on, lads. Go catch 'em up. You don't want to stand with me. Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike Strike! Strike! Strike Strike! I'm not going too fast, am I, my dear? I can't bear walking slowly. Well, Arthur's the same. I sometimes wonder if he doesn't get more from you than he does from his papa. Our sons spend the first half of their lives trying to be like their fathers, and the second half trying to avoid it. - How is he? - He's up in Blackburn at the moment. - You should have gone with him. - Well, I offered, but he said it was just work and there was no point. You mustn't blame him, you know. He's a man. And they can't deal with anything... messy. His father was exactly the same. You mean, you...? Suddenly... everything changes. What am I supposed to do if he keeps running away? Run faster. Where is everyone? Don't they know we've got a Cup match tomorrow? We're not going out of the Cup because of this. All right, Jack? I'm looking forward to this. Why weren't you lot at training? Watch out, Pa's angry. Don't you care about the match against Brigg tomorrow? I suppose he's still paying you. I want an answer, Tommy, I don't want a fight. 'Course not. 'Cause you'll be all right. Walsh'll look after you. What about the rest of us? The FA Cup comes around once a year. If we don't show up tomorrow, it's over. We'll have blown our chance. - You might be back to work next week. - And maybe not. Depends on how the meeting with Jackson's mob goes at the Cotton Masters'. How'll it look to the rest of these folk if I run out wearing Walsh's colors? - They're Darwen's colors. - Same difference. We stand together, or divided we fall. - We'd still like to win the Cup. - Not at any cost. No. We just want to keep what little we have. You have no idea what that's like. You don't need to worry that you can't provide for your family. You don't know the first thing about me. It's only football. No, it's more than that for me. Aye, you will. Run along. I'm sorry. I should've warned you, I know, but I wanted it to be a surprise for Arthur. I'm thrilled. You can save me from the endless talk about sport. I... I didn't know you were coming. Are you pleased to see me? Of course, he is. - Of course, I am. - I've missed you. More than you know. I'm afraid it's nearly time for that dreaded meeting. Oh, you don't have to dash off now, surely. I really should get ready. Shall we? Come on. Quickly. - I got you! - I really am pleased you came. Try not to be longer than you have to be. Then we could go for a walk before dinner. Yeah, if you like. Oh, we should take advantage of being away from London and... home and... everything else. I saw your mother yesterday. Oh? She told me to follow you up here. So we could talk. I'm not exactly sure what there is to say. I love you, Arthur. I can't imagine a life away from you. But I can't keep sitting at home, thinking about the life that might've been. I know we have to find a way through this. And we will, darling. We absolutely will. They've brought the carriage round. Oh, she's quite right. Look at the time. I should get going. Any plans to get up today? You don't need to knock to come into your own bedroom, Jimmy. You all right, Fergie? Aye, of course. Have you moved out for good, then? I think I'll ask her to marry me. What do they say about fools rushing in? Weren't you the one telling me to make an honest woman of her? Who's the letter from? What's in it that's so fascinating? It's from my sister. And it's what's not in it. Strike's holding. Aye. Tommy Marshall asked me where we stand. It's not for us to get involved. These people have became our friends. I feel bad. They're not getting paid. We still are. I know how this ends. We don't want any part of it. We're here to play football. Jimmy? What about the game tomorrow? The team won't play if they're on strike. They want to work, but they don't see they have any choice. Well, neither do I, but I'm bound by the ten percent cut the guild agreed. And you're gonna let them push you around? Look, I'm late. I'm expected at the Cotton Masters' Club. They ring the bell and you come running, eh? You know, Fergus, it wasn't easy getting where I am today. I was born with nothing. I had to make my own way. That's all everyone's trying to do. Do you think this is something I want? You think this is something I enjoy? These people don't just work at my mill, they are my mill. Then reinstate their wages, and they will call off the strike. Stand up to the guild. Without the bargaining power of the guild behind me, I'd end up paying far more for my raw cotton and it could ruin me. So, you're looking after yourself? See, if I go down... all those workers complaining about their wage cuts will be left with nothing. No work, no mill, no football... no Darwen. We won't accept ten percent. Agreed? We'd be satisfied with a five percent cut, but it couldn't be working the same hours we are now. And we wanna work fewer days. I'm sure you do, but I'm afraid that is not possible. We won't move from ten percent, and there'll be no change to the hours. Then why are we here if you won't even talk about it? We're here to listen. This is not a debate. What would be the benefit of a shorter week? - Wouldn't that mean lower productivity? - It would. - That's the point. - The trouble is oversupply. Reduce it and the prices go up. And the raw cotton? I don't know about you, Walsh, but I've already secured my supply. If it's not woven, it'll rot. Well, if the mills don't start running, a damn sight more of it'll rot. That's right. While the strike lasts, everyone loses. The workers don't get paid, and nor do we. And what's to stop them doing the same thing again next week? They always want more money and less work. What's to stop you lowering our wages for a third time? We will not be blackmailed, and we shall not give in to mob rule. If you want to see what a mob looks like, then you shall have it. I'd say that's meeting adjourned. Yeah. Come on, lads. - What happens now? - We wait. Their stomachs will be empty long before our pockets. Walk on. Both sides are talking. Neither of them are listening. - Come on. - And where do we go with this now? - Gonna have to be strong. - It's not enough. There's only one thing for it. I'll be taking the carriage on to Darwen. Arthur... Don't try and dissuade me. I don't know if the bank should give the mill owners their loan. I need to find out what's really going on up here. Meaning...? I'm only seeing one side of the story. Apologize to Alma. Tell her I'm not running away. Fergus, glad you've come to join us. I think I'll be off. See you tomorrow. I'll get some torches, stack 'em outside. What are the odds of this mess getting sorted out before the game against Brigg tomorrow? The guild are not gonna back down. So, the strike won't break? I don't think so. Look, they've tried talking, but if that doesn't work... Then what? I suppose there'll be a riot. That's what my brother said. - Okay, let's go. - Come on. Let's do it. Come on. What's that smell? Oh, you've not been cooking? Not exactly. Well, I tried. It's a pie. At least, it was until I cremated it. I'll see what's in the larder. - There's that toad-in-the-hole... - Doris. Doris... Will you... No, wait. I want to do it right. What's this all about? Hang on. I've got it somewhere. Will you pass me that wee box, from the side? Doris Platt... will you... Oh, Jesus. Just say it. Will you marry me? Of course I will. Oh. Come on! - Come on! - Yeah, including Stevens! Come on! Christ. Come on. All together. Come on, that's it. We tried talking. - But they didn't want to know. - No! Then we went on strike and nothing changed! Nothing! And why would it? When they only care about themselves and the profit they make from the sweat off our backs! - This is not a good idea. - He only wants to scare them. No one needs to get hurt. If we stand... shoulder to shoulder... then we don't have to be afraid of anyone no more. Fergie Suter showed us that last year when he stood up to the Old Etonians. He showed us... what we can do if we work together as a team. That's right! And he's gonna show us again tonight. Come on, Fergie. Fergie, come on, lad. Get up here. - Come on, lad, tell us. - Fergus! I usually let my feet do the talking, not my mouth. For good reason too. I care about Darwen. I care about the people that live here. - Yeah. - Aye. I hate to think they'd been walked over by anyone. See, that would make me angry to think about it. Sometimes that would make me want to get stuck into a good fight. But then what? What comes after? They'd fight back? Violence would only bring more violence. And that could cost you your lives. Our bosses will one day stand in judgment for the way they have treated us. I promise you! You can't promise us that. No! Mr. Kinnaird! What are you doing here? Have you got anything to say? No? You'd better make yourself scarce. You're not welcome here! The time for talking is over! Round up every good man, and let us take back what is rightfully ours! This way! Come on! After him! Martha, stop. Don't you see what's happening? We're not free to live our lives. Some of these men may be dead by the morning. And even if they're not, plenty will be in prison, with their futures ruined and gone, and how will that help the cause? - Lads, let's look down here. - He can't have gone far. Quick! Johnny thinks he spotted him! At 'em! Come here. Come on. Hurry. Will you come back with me? What business is it of ours what happens to him? Come on, love. I mean it. What did he ever do for us? Listen to it out there. Just listen. How's that going to make things better for any of us? Stokes! We're headed up to Jackson's place. Show him what for. We need every good man. Oh. Let me say goodbye to Anne. I'll be sure he comes along. You seen Mr. Kinnaird? No. Let's go. I should go. - You've done more than enough for me. - It's not safe out there. Those men are intent on attacking Colonel Jackson. I must warn him. I didn't stick my neck out so you'd wind up getting caught anyhow. Whatever you think of Jackson, him and his family don't deserve to be killed by an angry mob. - I'll go. - No, you will not! No one's gonna mind me. - I'll try and get ahead of them. - I can't let you do that. Go out there and you'll be lynched. You need to let me go instead. Please, you don't have to do this. Please. Lady. Arthur Kinnaird's a gentleman. Now that we've cut the workers' wages, I'm sure he'll recommend the loan. Stay there, Lady. Good girl. No, I'm sorry! - You can't come in! - What on earth is going on? - You need to get out! - Who are you? What's the meaning of this? You need to get out. They're coming for you. Please, you've got to hurry! Get him out of here! Here we are, Jackson! Show yourself, Jackson! - Jackson! - Come out here now! Now will you listen to us, Jackson? Come on! Let's start it off! There you are, Jackson! No to the ten percent! No to the ten percent! Come on down! No to the ten percent! Are you listening now, Jackson? No to the ten percent! No to ten percent! No to ten percent! - Come on, lass. - Police, stop! - Where do you think you're going? - No! Please, it wasn't me. - Shut that mutt up or I will. - No, please. Burn, Jackson! No! Do you have children? Um, no. I don't, no. Well, when you do... your child will face a very different future from ours. Mr. Stokes seems an enterprising man to me. What good will it do him? He'll never raise the money for that factory. Well, you should know that. You turned him down. No one'll take a chance on him. Where you going? I'm gonna find him. Bring him back. Uh, where's the mill? Over there. Thank you. Walsh? I need your help. Well, then you'll be disappointed. There's quite a few of your men who are lucky not to wake up in jail this morning. And what do you know of my men? More than you think. I'm afraid I may have got an innocent one in trouble. I hereby put you forward for trial for felonious riot, drunkenness, and attempted murder. You will face a sentence of up to 15 years imprisonment. That's a death sentence. We were having dinner when this man, one of the ringleaders of the mob, broke into my house. I came to warn you. And they shot my dog. You will be silent. I have two witnesses, my wife and my butler, Jenkins, both of whom have made written statements. I've read them, and I believe I've heard enough. Don't, please. Mr. Stokes, I hereby put you forward for... Your Honor, I must speak. If I may just say a few words. Mr. Walsh, do you know this man? I do, sir. This is Arthur Kinnaird, son and heir of Lord Kinnaird. Do you mean the footballer? Yes, Sir John. And it would do me a great favor if you let him speak. You may proceed. What this man says is the truth. I asked him to go to Colonel Jackson, and to warn him of the danger that he and his family were in. This man is completely innocent of all the charges brought against him. Who is this man to you? He is someone I trust. Someone who risked his own life in order to to save mine. Colonel Jackson and his family owe this man their lives. Your Honor, this man... Colonel Jackson, it is completely understandable that in the chaos of that dreadful night, you may have confused my business partner here with one of the rioters. Your what? My business partner. I'm investing in a shirt-making company that Mr. Stokes will open in Darwen, creating a great deal of employment. I trust Colonel Jackson's judgment, otherwise I would not have recommended the bank extend his loan. So, I have no doubt he will withdraw these accusations, and thank Mr. Stokes. Your Honor... perhaps I may have been over-hasty in pointing the finger at this man. I withdraw my accusation. And the thanks? Thank you, Mr. Stokes. Christ, Fergus. Where the hell are they? After last night's trouble, they could all be in jail. How long have we got? An hour. Where's everyone going? Where are they off to then? Your game against Brigg, of course. A run at the Cup is one of the few joys the people of this town have to look forward to. And you lot, as Darwen football team, are letting them down. You're taking that away from them, not us. Very well. This is the deal. We'll forget about the trouble you caused last night, and I'll give you five percent. Five days a week, you start back tomorrow. But the deal's off if you don't get to that match on time. Thank you, Mr. Walsh. There was trouble yesterday evening, I understand. I've seen a lot worse in Glasgow. John Cartwright, chairman of Blackburn, amongst other things. You're at the wrong ground. Maybe you are too. You're a good player, Mr. Suter, you'd have to be a fool not to see it. But you'll never realize your ambition with Darwen. I'm an ambitious man too. Darwen went from an average team to potential Cup winners when they recruited you, but potential... isn't good enough for me. I've got the finest players from all over the country, and you, Mr. Suter, are the finest of the lot. I guarantee... if you join Blackburn, we'll be the first working man's team to lift the FA Cup. I am ambitious. But I'm also loyal. To Darwen, to... Mr. Walsh. It seems they're not so loyal to you. They haven't even shown up for the match. How much did it take for Walsh to tempt you away from Partick? Two, three pound a week? Mr. Walsh employs me to work at the mill. I'll pay you 100 pound if you come and play for my team. Up front, and double whatever Walsh is paying you a week. Oh, very good, sir. Take care of yourself now. I'm not joking. Look around. How much longer is Walsh going to be able to hold this place together? One hundred pounds. Think about what you could do with money like that. Fergie. Come on, Darwen! What happened? We agreed, five percent. You went against the guild? Yeah. It feels good to be your own man. You better make it worth my while. Right, lads. Look lively! Half of them have been on the sauce all night. It's gonna take a miracle to get through this. Come on, Fergie! We've got a match to play! Come on!
