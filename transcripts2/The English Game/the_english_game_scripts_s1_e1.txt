 Keep the pack together! Come on, Arthur! Drive it forwards. Oi! Well played, Arthur. - Here he comes! - Are you sure it's him? Mr. Kinnaird, will the Old Etonians take the FA Cup this year? Can we have an autograph? What of your quarter-final opponents, Darwen FC? What do you think? Can they stop me winning another Cup?

 - Oh, no, no, no! Not at all, sir! - Never! You can quote them on that. Ah, it's a wonder your head still fits through the door. Fergus Suter, you and I are gonna make history. Darwen. This is Darwen. Come on. Let's go. I've seen how you play in Scotland. Your passing game is the future of football. Let's talk in my office. So... - How you both feeling? - Ready to get started. Hmm. So long as you keep your end of the bargain. Food and board's all arranged, as agreed.

 They're not gonna know what's hit 'em. Who are the new lads, then? No idea. Not from round here, that's for sure. They're not mill workers either. Why has Walsh gone and brought them here? Got our new jerseys, lads. Finished 'em up last night. And youse, captain. - There you go. - Ready for the big game Saturday? And one for each of the new lads. That's all there was, Mr. Walsh. I've only done 11. Jones, Harris, you don't mind, do you? I'd like to give Mr. Suter and Mr. Love a chance. Fergus Suter... and Jimmy Love? Not the Fergus Suter and Jimmy Love who play for Partick? They don't play for Partick anymore. They're Darwen players now. Mr. Walsh, with respect, sir, Jones and Harris helped us get to the quarter-finals. And these two are going to help us win the damn thing. Now, this is my mill. My team. Now, give 'em the jerseys. Good lads. All right. I've put you in here. This is nice. Mr. Walsh was most particular. Which of you is Mr. Suter? That's me. That means you must be Mr. Love. Guilty as charged. Does Mr. Platt work for Mr. Walsh? Uh, he used to. I'm a widow. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - Jimmy, for the love of God, no. - What? Keep your mind on the game. Did you know there were 43 teams in the Cup this year? And Arthur's is one of the last eight left in. Isn't that splendid? We're playing a mill team in the quarter-finals this Saturday, Papa. Really? The quarter-finals? Do the millhands often get that far? No, not usually. Will you go on with this once your child arrives? I hadn't given it much thought. Did you play much sport, Papa? Oh. I shot, of course. I never hunted. - I'm not against it... - But you are against football? No, no, no, no, no. I think it a healthy way for little boys to get fit. All aboard! All passengers! Train's about to depart! All aboard, please! Only gentlemen have lifted the Cup. Men from fine schools, with fine clothes, fine lives. Imagine what it would mean to see men like us lift it. That's the dream. Well, I want to wake up and find it's more than a dream. To find out it's happened. See, that's the reason I brought you to Darwen, Fergus. Wait here, lads. Stop, lads. Hold up. What do you make of this, lads? You'd think the Queen lived here. Boys. - Look at these lads! - Gentlemen. Little lads in suits! Welcome. I'm, uh... I'm captain of the Old Etonians. - You're Arthur Kinnaird? - That's right. I saw you play at Hampden a few years back against Queen's Park. Mm-hmm. You were good. Well, that's high praise indeed. Of course, the game's changed since your heyday. I mean, it has in Scotland, at least. Must be hard moving with the times. Well, now we've established that my best days are in the past, perhaps we should get moving. - I never meant... - What's your name? Fergus Suter. The Suter who plays for Hibernian? Partick. Well, I used to, at any rate. Now I play for Darwen. It's hardly a... hardly a local team for you. Jimmy and I wanted a change of scene. - Jimmy? - Jimmy Love. - He made the trip down, too. - Did he indeed? Uh, everyone, these boys will show you to your changing rooms. Hurry up, lads. Suit up and boot up. I've been through our Football Association records, and neither Fergus Suter nor Jimmy Love played for them in the previous rounds. There's nothing in the rules that say they can't switch team members. True, but why would two successful Scottish players leave Glasgow to join a tinpot mill team in Darwen? Clearly, they're being paid. To play football? But that's against the rules. Surely, no one would risk suspension from the Cup? It would explain why two players would travel from Scotland to join a team they have no connection with. - Now, how do we prove it? - We don't need to. We'll beat them today, and they'll be knocked out the competition. - Are we right, lads? - Aye. Now, remember, they're a rough team. They'll play as a pack and try to run through you. - Let's go then, boys. - Come on. Stick together. When we get out, I lead from the front. - Come on. - Fergie! You coming? What's all this to-do about? Playing in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. - Really? - Yeah. Just waiting on news from the match. Well, I've made it, Mr. Suter, even if my glory days are behind me. Right. Let's knock these posh bastards off the perch. Right. Go on, lads. Let's go. Is that it? I suppose he's the captain, Fergus. Stay tight. Yep. Come on, boys. Send them back. Play the ball. Come on! In tight! Take him! Come on now! Game doesn't seem to have changed so very much, Mr. Suter. Come on. Come on, boys. The Old Etonians have scored again! - There we go! - Yes! We got one back! - It's three-one! - Yes! Half-time! Half-time, gentlemen. That Kinnaird is a bloody hard man to get around. We need to fight fire with fire. They shove you, you shove 'em back. They hit you, you hit 'em back. - You can't win playing at their own game. - So, what do you suggest we do instead? At this rate, I'm gonna be coming out. I want five more goals this half, so we have something to celebrate at dinner. Yes! What makes you such an expert? I'm telling you how we play in Scotland, that's all. Would you listen to him? But Marshall's the captain. Well, Suter's the captain now. Lads, football is not complicated. We don't always have to run the ball forward. I'll stay behind, and I'll play it back. Jimmy, you know what you're doing, right? Tommy, this game is about space. I want you to go out wide on the left. You're the fastest man on the pitch. You're not getting a chance to show it. Let the ball do the work. We pass, we move, we pass again. Space. But that's not how we play. Wider. Right out onto the touchline. Spread out. - They've moved their formation. - Isn't that better? We'll run right through them. Come on, boys! I want the same again. - Same again! - Here we go, Darwen. Right on it! Yes! Yes! Get it over to him! Yeah! It's five-four! The ball's gone before you can put a tackle in. Just do whatever it takes. Come on! Come on! It's five-five! Yes! It's full-time, gentlemen. Full-time, thank you. We'll take a few minutes to get fresh air into our lungs and then extra time. Look, no extra time was agreed before the game. Since when was that a rule? It's not in Scotland. It is here. Come on, boys. I'm glad that's finished. That was more tiring than I expected. He said no to extra time. What's all this about? Why are we not playing extra time? Because he knows they're beaten. It'll be replayed next Saturday. These men have been up since before dawn and traveled for hours. You expect them to do it all again? We're here now. Let's finish it now. Look, we can refer this to the president of the Football Association, if you prefer. - Well, how long will that take? - Not too long. Marindin? He's the president of the FA? He's your bloody goalkeeper. We're all on the board of the Football Association. Do you have a problem with that? Don't you? I'm afraid extra time wasn't agreed, gentlemen. Those are the rules. And rules are made to be adhered to. We had you beaten today. You know we did. If you are right, then you'll beat us again... next Saturday. Come on. No, I just worry one day Arthur will come home with a broken leg. Well, if he does, you can be sure it won't be his own. What am I missing up there? Oh, Monkey's telling me about the game. Ah, Arthur's returning the favor at this end of the table. Have you told her how it ended? There's nothing to tell. Well, now I'm intrigued. Uh, it's not really my story. How strange. Usually, I can't stop you talking about football. Or cricket. Or rugby, for that matter. When it was a draw, Arthur wouldn't allow them extra time to settle it. So they must come back next week. All the way from Lancashire? In all the years we've been married, I believe this is the first time you've ever asked me a single question about football. But is it true, Arthur? We had to do what was right. It seems rather unkind. - Can I second that? - We must follow the rules. - Or why do we have them? - Absolutely. And if you'd agreed extra time, Darwen would've beaten you. Don't be absurd. Sorry, old boy, but I must agree. Another ten minutes and you would've been out of the Cup on your ear. Are you suggesting I acted in an underhand manner? Well, I think "underhand" is a bit strong. Shall we say, uh, the rules were very convenient. Do you really think we would've been beaten by a gaggle of... Of what? Mill workers? No. Professionals. Darwen team are fielding professional players. Paying two members of their team to play. But what's wrong with that? This is a game for amateurs and gentlemen. It's our game. Your game? - We invented it. - Who's "we"? The Old Etonians? Yes! As a matter of fact. Eton, Charterhouse, Harrow. Lots of schools played a part, but the point is we took a raggle-taggle pastime... with different rules wherever it was played, and we turned it into a proper game. For gentlemen. Heavens. Do gentlemen shout? Ladies... I'm catching your eye. Shall we leave the men to their port? Well, shall we talk about something a little less contentious? What? Like the Russian-Turkish War? ♪ There was owd yowe wi' only one horn ♪ ♪ O dear Johnny ♪ ♪ She made a living Among the green corns ♪ ♪ So turn the wheel so bonny ♪ I feel like a fraud. We're celebrating like we won. We didn't win, did we? We came nearer to winning than we ever have done before. And we may yet do it Saturday. Look around. You've given these people something to believe in. The game feeds the soul when they have nothing else that does it in their life. ♪ So pindar sent for his man one day ♪ ♪ O dear Johnny ♪ ♪ To pin the old yowe, if only he may ♪ ♪ So turn the wheels so bonny ♪ ♪ So along comes the man And he grabs the yowe's horn ♪ ♪ O dear Johnny... ♪ I'm gonna head back. - Come on, it's just getting started. - Jimmy, here. Don't drink too much. Fergie, come on, pal. Look, what's one more beer? Come on. ♪ So butcher was sent To take this yowe's life ♪ ♪ O dear... ♪ Well, I suppose I am allowed an opinion. Not on things you don't understand. I think I understand perfectly. You're afraid of them, aren't you? Afraid? You're afraid new teams like Darwen will take over your game. You and Alfred and all the others. You're scared you'll lose control of it. That's ridiculous. Is it? Arthur, you're a decent man, but this game brings out the worst in you. Makes you childish and defensive and petulant. Well, I'm sorry if I disappoint you. What? I want us to be good parents... and to set a good example for our child. We will be. Of course we will be. Why wouldn't we be? ♪ I'm a four-loom weaver As many a one knows ♪ ♪ I've nowt to eat And I've worn out my clothes ♪ ♪ My clogs are all broken And stockings I've none ♪ ♪ You'd scarce give me tuppence For owt I've gotten on ♪ I'm Fergus... Suter. Oh, I know who you are. People won't stop shouting your name. I'm Martha Almond. You should've sung in the pub tonight. I should get going. I could... I could walk you home, if you like. See, it's like this. I have a little girl. She's two years old. She has no dad. He's gone, but... I was never married to him in the first place. Do you still want to walk me home? Sure. Why not? We got off on the wrong foot. Let me buy you another. I shouldn't. But go on, then. I'm buying, though. No arguments. So what did Walsh offer to get you all the way down from Glasgow? Oh, my head! Feels good to have a man in the house again. I hope you don't mind me saying, but... you've got a lovely smile. - Sorry, I don't mean to embarrass you. - No, you didn't. What's coming next, I wonder? How about this? We best get going. Aye, we should. - Thanks for that. - Ah, pleasure. Oh, won't you have some breakfast? Oh, just a piece of bread. Gentlemen, the situation is no longer tenable. Our mills are struggling to turn a profit, and the banks are starting to call in their loans. It is regrettable that the only course of action I can see to protect our business is a wage cut. As chairman of the guild, I must insist that we present a united front on this matter. To do otherwise would only invite trouble. I propose a five-percent wage cut for every worker. - All those in favor. - Aye! All those against? Nay. Most of my workers have families. They can barely get by as it is. James, you know I don't like it, but the alternative is that the mills go out of business. How will they get by then? How many workers do you employ at your mill, Mr. Walsh? A couple of hundred? A hundred and seventy-seven. Across my mills, I have 3,000. Cartwright? Two thousand. Two-and-a-half. The motion is passed. Every member of the Cotton Masters' Guild will impose the same cut in wages. Do you ever worry... about whether you'd make a good father? Not really. I suppose I assumed... that it would be just as it had been for my father. And for his father before him. I don't remember seeing much of you when I was young. Don't be silly. You were brought down every evening. No. I was brought down every tea time. Or after tea, if Mama had guests, but I don't remember your being there often. I was here. You came and saw me sometimes when I was already in bed. But not much. All over this country... all over the world, there are children with no food and no shelter. You really cannot expect me to feel much sympathy for the childhood that you enjoyed. So, there's nothing you would have done differently? Don't over-complicate it. Your role is to provide. To be the man of the house. Don't tell me you've quarreled again. We were discussing fatherhood... as it happens. Oh, you surprise me. You wouldn't be surprised if you heard what he said. And you'll be happy to hear that I want to know my children better than he did. I am happy. I'm so looking forward to becoming a mother. - They've cut wages by five percent. - What? - And what's next, ten? Fifteen? - How will I feed my family? - I know. - What? - It's a wage cut, five percent. - They can't do that. The mill will reopen tomorrow. Go and spend the day with your families. - What? Why? - You've already cut our wages. It don't matter why. I'll get it sorted. What about pay? We gonna get paid for today? I can't pay you for days when the mill isn't working. I'm sorry. It'll all get straightened out by tomorrow. Please, go home. All members of Darwen Football Club, follow me. The bank called in a loan. When I couldn't pay up immediately, they foreclosed on the mill. Now, I can get the mill reopened tomorrow, but it'll take all the liquidity. What's this got to do with us? The train tickets to take the team back down to London, I need that money. I need it to get the mill reopened and get the men back to work. We're gonna have to forfeit the match. How much did you waste getting this pair in? What? He's paying 'em to play. - He paid 'em to leave Partick. - Wait a minute. - I saw the money you gave Jimmy. - That's none of your business. Now we're out of the Cup 'cause you've given away our fares. You can have it back. - Barely a quarter of what's needed. - Maybe not. But whilst our wages were being cut, you were paying them to play football. And what would've happened if we were found out? We'd be banned from the Cup for God knows how many years! - Enough. - You cheated. And you made the rest of us cheat without even knowing it. I said that's enough! So it's over? I'm very sorry. Come on. We don't know that Mr. Walsh won't find the money somewhere. We've given him all day. As it is, we'll be sleeping on the train. But I... I thought the OEs would beat us, and we would be sent home then, all right? With our tail between our legs. Don't pretend that you don't care about this place. I seen it last night when you realized how much this meant to these people. You care about them too. No. I care about the money. But we can't give up now! It's the FA Cup! It is finished, Jimmy. The mill's closed. We're not going south. And I can play football for nothing back home with my family. Pack your things. Stay. I can't. But you can. I can't. Fergie and I... We've always been together. He needs me. Stay till tomorrow at least. You don't want to travel at night. Are you coming or not? Give me a minute. I swear to God. You need rid of that hat before we get back. Folk'll have you down as a bloody Sassenach. I don't care what they have me down as. Jimmy! - You've got to come quickly. - What is it? You'll see. Come on. Come with me, both of you. This is our train. We're going home. I don't understand. Word got out Darwen would be forfeiting. The town won't have it. Tom Hindle came up with the idea. We're selling subscriptions. They can either pay weekly or all at once. The point is, we're going to the rematch. - Don't those people need that money? - Maybe, but they need football too. - We're proud of you, lads. - You're what Darwen's made of. Here you go. You're short three players. The match is due to start in ten minutes. Well, I'm sure they won't be much longer. You can use the dressing room if you'd like to be more comfortable. We'll be on the pitch. If you don't have a team on time, you forfeit. Or you play with what you've got. You can't expect us to play when there's only eight of us. To quote you, Mr. Kinnaird, "Rules are made to be adhered to." That is unless they happen not to suit you, of course. Ten minutes... or we claim the win. To whom will you claim the win? To the FA committee? The press. Then everyone will see what good sports you gentlemen are. Who does he think he is? If we don't have a full team, we ought to forfeit the game. What? Why? You heard him. We're supposed to be gentlemen. Two more minutes and the match is ours. They're here. All of them. Whatever he's paying you, make sure you earn it. We had them beat before. We can do it again. Where the hell have you been? You almost cost us the match. Now, come here. Now, we'll win this game, if we stop them playing their way. Alfred, stay on Love. Don't give him any time on the ball. - What about Suter? He's the real problem. - I'll stay on Suter. You leave him to me. - All right? - All right. - Time. - All right, gents. Gentlemen. Jimmy! Cross it, Jimmy! Did you see what Alfred did? It didn't seem quite right. Maybe not, but I'm afraid there'll be a great deal more of it. Foul! Referee! - Forward! - As a pack! Get off me! Come on, Suter! Front! Together! Together! I thought you youngsters were meant to be quicker than us older folk. Hurry up! At the ball! Heads up! Heads up! Full-time. Full-time. That was a good game. Did you even play? Or did you just shadow me to stop me playing? There's no need to be a bad loser. Kinnaird can have his Cup. Next season, it'll be ours. Yeah? If you'll stay. Do you want me to? Tommy Marshall thinks I'm a waste of money. Well, he's wrong. You're the only chance we've got of taking the Cup. Besides, people here, they love to watch you play. It gives 'em hope and pride and so much more. You're valued here, Suter. Come on, lads. Let's go home. Admit it, they won! Can I just say, well done us. Hear, hear! Speech! - Come on, Arthur, speech! - Speech! Come on. I won't pretend I'm not jolly pleased the way things have turned out. To have beaten Darwen, and to be once again in the semi-finals... Excuse me. I'm so sorry, I... I must leave you for a moment. - Shall I... - No, no, no. Please, sit. Enjoy the rest of dinner. And... And well done. All of you. Very well done. Excuse me. Please. Have they gone? They have, at last. Ada had to put Monkey in a fireman's lock before she could get him out. How are you feeling? Hmm? You any better? No, not much better, to be honest. No... No... No! No! - Can anybody hear me?! - No! Somebody send for a doctor! Now, we might've lost... but the town's still proud of you. Here's the man of the hour, Fergus Suter! Suter! Suter! Suter! Yeah!
