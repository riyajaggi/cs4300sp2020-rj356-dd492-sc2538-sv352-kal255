 How much is Cartwright paying you? Six pounds per week. When I bought you from Partick, you left without a qualm. I should have known one day someone would come along and buy you from me. I do appreciate the opportunity you gave me. - But not enough to stay when money calls. - My family needs it. I had to. Sir... Your last payment. You would've been a hero here.

 I hope it's worth it. - You should have told me. - I know I should. I spoke to Cartwright. He wants you as well. He pays a lot more than Walsh, Jimmy. You'll never have to work in a mill again. Just football. That's it. And if the FA asks how you earn your wage? We work in Mr. Cartwright's office. Except you don't! - Anyway, it's not about the football. - Blackburn is still in the Cup. We can win it together. We came here together. You went to Blackburn on your own.

 You left me. Darwen's my team and my family now. Hmm. I'm not sure I ever said thank you. I'm very sure you don't need to. Come on. I missed you. I don't know why. I never left. It may be sunny, but I'm frightfully cold. The only trouble with Scottish weather is there's so much of it in Scotland. I must head back down to Monkey's soon. Got a match against Preston coming up. What would you like me to do? Well, if you're really asking, I'd like you to come with me. Perhaps you could watch the game. I'd like that, too. And there's someone there I want you to meet. I think I owe you an apology. You don't owe me anything. Well, I am. I am sorry, anyway. I should be pleased. Darwen has a new villain to gossip about. You're no villain. Tell that to all the women who think that Jenie might be their husband's daughter. I had to say yes to Cartwright. I have responsibilities. Well, I hope you have a wonderful life in Blackburn. Watch your feet. I may play for Blackburn... but I'll be staying in Darwen. Why? Where else will I find a lass who cleans my shoes? There he is. Distracting the staff. Sorry. - I got lost. - Come with me. It's time to show you the future. I've had the pitch leveled and all of this is new. - Over here! - New facilities. - Go on, get it! - New stand. Cut! We get 2,000 or more most games these days. Big tackle. You're right. This is the future. That's it. Nice. Good going, Jack. - Is that...? - England International Jack Hunter. - But he plays for Sheffield. - He did. Like Burns played for Partick, and you played for Darwen. I'm assembling a team of the best players north of Eton. You found a place in town yet? I thought I might stay in Darwen. Something or... someone special there? Maybe. Keep your mind on football, Mr. Suter, on the Druids in the quarter-finals. I hope I get my money's worth. This is where these women choose to live? When they have nowhere else to go, Arthur. It's not a choice, exactly. It's just through here. And I thought the outside looked rather grim. I was told Miss Cronshaw was here. Miss Cronshaw? Mrs. Kinnaird. I wanted to see how you and your daughter were faring. Miss Cronshaw? Betsy? Thank you. I'm sorry. Don't be. How long did she live? She isn't dead. I gave her away. I see. There's nothing unusual in that, my dear. Miss Cronshaw had to think of her daughter's welfare. - Didn't you? - That's what they told me, and if I gave her up, I could start again, so to speak, without a black mark against my name. I daresay that's true. But when I met her... when I held her little hand in mine... You could've told them you changed your mind. Alma. They never even gave me a chance. It all happened so quickly. I never said goodbye. Not properly. I suppose I'm being punished for my sin. I'm not sure I see it that way. How do you see it? I see a brave woman having to endure something unendurable. I called her after you, ma'am. Alma. She'd never have been born without you. Darling, do you really want to disturb the arrangements? I'm not sure what I want. Mrs. Kinnaird, what a pleasant surprise. I hope you've not been waiting long. - Miss Cronshaw wants her daughter back. - Uh, I think... - what Mrs. Kinnaird means... - She deeply regrets letting her go. You must know that is quite normal for mothers who have given up their children for adoption. It seems so cruel. It is reality, Mrs. Kinnaird. What future do you think that child would have with a mother who'd been expelled from decent society? Then we shall give Miss Cronshaw an allowance - until she's able to find employment. - My dear... That is kind, but it wouldn't change anything. This way, the girl will grow up in a loving family, and... no one will ever know the stain of her birth. - Anyway, it's too late. - Why? Because the child has already been placed. Who's taken her? We never give out that information, but it's all very respectable. I am sorry, and I do understand how painful these decisions can be, but this really is the best course for everyone. Yes. Um, our apologies for taking up your time, Mrs. Cartwright. Yes, thank you. The manager told me a customer had asked to see me. Well, I thought if I said my name, you might not come. I wouldn't have. You look very well. I look tired. Jenie wakes early every morn and will not be told. I, uh... saw you with Mr. Suter. I know. I'm not sure he deserves you. I'm not sure I deserve him. I don't suppose you ever think of me? I think of you all the time. I think of you. Fifty times a day I decide to give it all up - and be with you. - And yet... I can't always wait for you. If I were to leave Lydia for a woman who bore my child, when that's the one thing she can never have... I don't think she'd recover. I knew what I was doing, John. My eyes were open. You're not to blame. If you are... well, so am I. But my life has got lost in all this, and I want it back. You've made your choice and... ...I think it's the right one, but... now you must let me go my own way. Mr. Walsh to see you, sir. Why am I here? The Old Etonians are playing Preston in a few days' time. I do follow the football. I've heard rumors. They're very concerned by reports of professionalism in the Lancashire area. And with good reason, as we both know. They may be asking around, and I'd appreciate your... discretion with regard to Fergus Suter. That boy had something special for Darwen, but you took him. You took the heart of our team. Just as you bought him from Partick. You showed me the way. A hundred pounds to compensate you for Suter, and I propose a match played here between my Blackburn and your Darwen next week. We'll split the receipts, which will be large. Rivalry's good for business. You don't have to cook for me. I know. I swear I'm going deaf from them machines. Cheers, love. I can get you free tickets to the match tomorrow if you like. The Druids are said to be seven feet tall with hair down to their knees. You've got to speak to me at some point, Jimmy. - We live together. - Well, maybe it's time you moved out. I suppose you can afford it. If that's what you want. Since when have you cared about what I want? Fine. He's your best friend. Without him, we'd never have met. I left my home and my team for him. And now he's just left me... left all of us to join our biggest rivals. And he was rubbish in the Cup, so we're knocked out. What kind of a friend is that? No friend of mine, that's for sure. Oh, I've almost done this lot, sir. I'll finish the other box tomorrow. No, Martha, I'm afraid you won't. I saw you earlier. Perhaps you think you can climb the ladder here by seducing men of influence. Well, Mr. Cartwright is a good man. A married man. - I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again. - No, it won't. We accepted you had a child without benefit of clergy, but I see now such behavior is habitual for you. I need this job, sir. I thought better of you. There's no place for your sort here. As I thought, all huff and no puff. Speaking of which, who's coming with me to see Blackburn play the Welsh Druids? - Are you going? - Certainly. If we beat Preston, we could be against one of them in the final. - I want to see them play. - I'll join you. I'm curious to see Suter make his bow. Suter? Has he left Darwen? When did that happen and why? Oh, Blackburn are building a team to beat everyone. Even the best. Well, the best aren't the best if they can be beaten. It's not right, all these players changing team willy-nilly. Scared of a little competition, Alfred? They're not competition, they're a sideshow. I shall enjoy seeing the Druids give them a good thrashing. - Are you feeling quite well, Alma? - Good. Sorry, my mind is... I'm fine. What am I to say? My brother gave them to me. That child will be far better cared for in a family with means. Surely, no one could love a child more than its own mother. Darling, I know you're thinking of Henry, and of course I would give anything to have him here now, but you must understand the circumstances of this case are very different. Why? Both Miss Cronshaw and I have lost a child. Your turn, Arthur, unless you've retired after your first dismal effort. Oh, Arthur won't give in that easily. He has to do much worse before he throws in the towel. Shut up. I'm getting the hang of this. Oh, my dear, I wish I could help. But you can, now that I think of it. In what way? I need an address. I have a feeling I'm going to regret making the offer. How are you finding married life, then? Not that different. Pretty much the same. But you feel sort of... trapped. Trapped? Forced to live with a goddess amongst women, in endless happiness. Mrs. Hornby. I'm sorry, no one told me you were coming in. No one knew. How can I help? I want to run through the adoption arrangements for the infants. But why? Nothing's changed. I just want to be clear about it. - Are all the babies put up for adoption? - Not all. We try to encourage it for the sake of the mother as much as the child but... some do resist. And who takes them? Ordinary people, for the most part, and, well, the rest go to agencies, really, who place the babies in their own time. And charge for the service? We do not charge them. What they do is their own affair. Mrs. Hornby, we cannot afford to keep the children here, unless Mr. Hornby were to increase his allowance. But what sort of places do we send them to? Respectable institutions. And it means that we can... clear the decks, so to speak, whenever we might need to. - Do we keep a record of these adoptions? - Certainly. I'm still not convinced this is a good idea. Promise me you won't do something daft. I won't do anything wrong. That's not quite the same thing. I take the central spot, you play wide. - But I always play in the middle. - You did. I'm captain here. Go on. Suter. Yes. Jimmy would've got to that. Suter! Over here! Wake up, Suter. He needed to come to the ball. Get your bloody head in the game, Suter. - Come on, Suter! - Not a dream debut so far. Suter seems lost. Men playing for money will never give as much as men playing for the love of the game. Hunter! Here! Here! Here! Hunter! Hunter! Hunter! Hunter! Hunter! Jack Hunter, as well as Suter? If Cartwright's paying them, I'll... You'll what? He must be paying them. Have you ever seen crowds this happy? I haven't. That's the point. This game means everything to them. You'll have to do better than that, my lad, if you're to make a life at Blackburn. Hunter! Hunter! Hunter! Hunter! Hunter! Hunter! What happened? You weren't your usual self out there. It's a new team for me. I'm still learning their ways. Are they learning your ways? In my experience, it'd be wise to do so. Do you miss Darwen? I miss people. A couple of people. But I'm here now. Well, speaking player to player, there's nothing better for your game than a settled private life, if you want to be the best, nothing worse than an unsettled one. Believe me, I know. Arthur, aren't you going to show us your factory? Coming. Look over there. That's Fergus Suter. They said you'd be up here. You're not working today? Not today. Not tomorrow. What happened? Waiting on men who get rich exploiting the workers wasn't for me. Don't you need the wage? I'll manage. How was your first game? You didn't miss much. What, Suter the Shooter had a bad game? What? A week or two ago, you had a big smile on your face. All that money, can't see a trace of it now. It's not as simple as you all seem to think. I've got responsibilities. My family depends on me. Your family is in Glasgow. Who have you got here? Everybody needs someone, Fergus. Don't be too proud to admit that. We've just installed three new machines. It's not exactly Savile Row. Also, Walsh gave us a good rate and that means profit. Well, profit requires product and sales. I'm sad to say, none of my contacts seem keen to look at our designs. I can't imagine why. Fortunately, Stokes here tells me he's secured orders from some local football clubs. Eleven shirts for Darwen FC, best team in the land. Also, shirts for Preston, Burnley, Bolton Wanderers, Everton, and Blackpool. We're on our way. I said we would be. You have been busy. I'm afraid I'm not bringing much to the table. You paid for the table and everything else. Say what you like about the north, they do know how to make a pie. Well, perhaps you should move up here permanently, Alfred. London would never forgive me for depriving them of Laura. Who says I'd come with you? How was Brockshall today? Any more dramas unfolding? - You went back? - I went. - Alma was good enough to keep me company. - Yes. - We haven't talked about the football yet. - No. Hasn't it been lovely? Poor old Suter. He must be kicking himself. And yet they still won. But at what cost? Marindin's looking for a team to make an example of. Warn off other professional players. I'm starting to think Alma was right. What does it matter? Oh! Don't talk like that. If you ask me, Marinidin's just worried that Blackburn might take the Cup from the Old Etonians. - He's always worried about something. - Blackburn don't stand a chance. All that absurd passing. Nonsense. Besides, you still have to beat Preston tomorrow. They're playing well this season. You might want to go easy on the port. You joining us? I can't. - I have to work, for once. - Hm. Laura, Alma? I'm sorry, darling, but we all know you'll win. I can't either. I've got other plans. What plans? Arthur, do you approve of this dereliction of duty? - Darling, what are you... - Please, excuse me. Alma? Excuse me. I thought... after Rossie and Henry's Wood we were... we were doing better. We were. We are. Is it the football? Do you agree with my father that I ought to let it go? Football will always be a part of your life. It upset you when that... woman at Brockshall gave up her child, but such things are not unusual. I know. Well, then, of course, you still... you still miss our baby, - and you always will... - Yes. I always will. You cannot protect me from that. But there's something wrong here. I don't think Mrs. Cartwright is exactly hiding anything so much as not facing it. And I mean to put it right. Please say goodnight from me to the others. What are you doing here? Doris told me where you were. What's that you're making? A bed... for Doris and me. The other one broke. Have you found a new place yet? I think so, but I can't move in till next week. I wish you'd come with me, Jimmy. Yeah, I'm not a Judas like you. I know I should've told you, but I was thinking of my family. Jimmy, I have to provide for them. I have to get them away... from him. Just think if it were for Doris. Do you remember when we met? Not really. Eight years old, and I'd been caught by Mrs. Barrie stealing apples. Pears. And you said it was you. You were sent home with a letter and beaten by your da. You didn't even know me. You are my brother, Jimmy, whether you like it or not, and I don't want to do it all without you. I heard you were rubbish yesterday. And you ruined my wedding day. I know. And I'm sorry about that. What Blackburn are doing, it's the future. We could be a part of it. We could be the first working class team to lift the FA Cup high above our heads at the Oval. Now, what would that do for the game, Jimmy? I need you with me. Just give it some thought. Whatever happens, you're my best friend. And I'm buying you a bed. We can't have the new Mrs. Love sleeping in that death trap, can we? Come on. We have to catch that train to Preston. - I'm sorry I'm not coming. - Are you? I hope you win. I mean it. Arthur! We don't want to be late for the quarter-final! Don't let her do anything silly. I wonder if I should have left her. It took many educated men more than a decade of squabbling to determine the rules of football, and yet it is far less complicated than the female mind. But do you think she'll be all right? Let's just concentrate on today's match, Arthur. You can have the carriage this afternoon, but I'm coming with you. No, you're not. My dear, you heard what Arthur said. I should never have helped you with this, but if you're going to get into trouble, I must be there to back you up. No. And I mean it. If there is trouble, I'm an outsider. You, on the other hand, are the patroness of Brockshall. An attack on you could bring the whole place into disrepute. No doubt that cost a pretty penny. The business of football is growing. Football is not a business, it is a game. They'd do well to remember that. Cartwright's selling boards around the pitch at Blackburn advertising local businesses. He's making a fortune. Over 3,000 went to watch them play against the Druids. Yes, because suddenly, Hunter has come from Sheffield, Burns from Partick, Suter from Darwen. It is a mockery, and if this continues, it'll only be the richest teams that win everything. Isn't that what happens already? - Perhaps this levels the field. - That's cheating. I'm going to watch Blackburn's next game against Darwen, an exhibition match played purely for profit... to fill Blackburn's coffers and buy their next player. I plan to find the evidence needed to expel them from the FA. Expel them? Were there really 3,000 people? Gosh, they do love their football here, don't they? Nothing in life is more important to them. Like you, Arthur. You put football before everything. Not before Alma. No? Well... good to hear. I wonder if she would agree. You coming, Arthur? Arthur? - Same again is it? - A round for the table. Cheers. There you go. You're not welcome in this establishment. This is a pub for Darweners. Well, that's lucky, as I still live here. You're not welcome in Darwen either. - There's plenty of room in Blackburn. - I'll bear that in mind. Marshall. I told you to go. Sorry I'm late, boys. Anyone want a beer? Fergie? He's not welcome here, Jimmy. If you drink with him, neither are you. That's a shame. I was gonna buy a round. - Um, I wouldn't say no. - Grand. Actually, I'm... I'm glad you're all here. Because, uh... I've got some news. I'm joining Fergus at Blackburn. What? We were together at Partick. We were together at Darwen. It doesn't feel right, me staying away from Blackburn. - You can keep your bloody pint. - Tommy, it's a job, that's all. You drink still with Stokes, though he's left the mill to set up on his own. Ted Stokes did not join the enemy! It's not a war. What did you say? You come down here, and we know you're paid to play and we're not, and we have to change our game and play your way, and just as we're getting somewhere, just as we're making a name for ourselves, you run off after more money, and take your friend, and we're back to square one. 'Course it's a bloody war! You'll see that well enough once when we get on the pitch. A Blackburn player now? We all know you embarrassed yourself at the last match. Couldn't have that happen again. Hello? Who are you? I am Mrs. Kinnaird. I apologize for calling uninvited, but I wish to speak to you about your new child. You mean you've come for a baby. A girl. She was called Alma Cronshaw when she left the refuge at Brockshall. Who gave you this address? I... found it out for myself. I didn't catch your name, madam. Is your husband at home? Cronshaw, did you say? Let me have a look. As you can see, we've got plenty for you to pick from. Here we go. Cronshaw girl's in number eight. Hello, my little darling. Hang on. Hang on. Money first. That'll be ten pounds. - What? - My adoption fee, ten pounds. But the refuge does not charge for the children. They need to get rid of 'em, I takes 'em off their hands. Rest is my business. These are precious human lives, not commodities to bought or sold. D'you want the babe or not? Only, I've other clients coming in later and they've asked for a baby girl. I'm returning this child to her mother. You can do what you want with her once you give me ten pounds. But I do not have ten pounds with me. Give me the child now and I'll send ten pounds later. Hand her over. No. You're not leaving here with that baby. Now, give it to me! - No, sir, you can't go up there! - Let me through. I strongly advise you to step away from my wife. Let's go, Arthur. What a terrible place. Terrible woman. We'll have it closed down. I'll talk to Monkey, see if we can get Brockshall onto a better footing financially. I don't think he or Ada knew what was going on. Oh, no. Of course not. I'm not convinced Mrs. Cartwright knew the worst. She wouldn't have allowed it. I'll see what can be done about getting the Kinnaird Foundation aboard. I think we can make a difference. I'm sorry about your ten pounds. Are you sure you're all right? I know you think I was a fool to go, but think... what would this child's life have been if I hadn't? But there are so many children. We can't help them all. Not all, no, but we can help a lot of them if we put our minds to it. I wonder if you're right. We should do more. We certainly can. I cannot believe Arthur Kinnaird missed the quarter-final... and for me. Were they very upset? I was needed by someone more important. Don't worry about the others. If they win, I'll be forgiven. - What are you doing here? You can't... - I heard about your job. I wanted to say you'll have it back or another one, I'll see to it. I can't keep taking favors from your hands. People will put two and two together. The manager of the club is almost there already. I'll have him sacked. No. That would only make it worse. I have no regrets, but we can't carry on like this, it's not right. - Martha, we can... - No! It's over. No more. Will you let me give you money then? She's my baby, Martha. I have a right to help. - Please. - I have to find my own path, for my sake and for Jenie. Goodbye, John. Betsy. Is that my girl? I've missed you. I've missed you so much. How long do I have with her? Just your whole life. Hey. You did something rather good here... I'd say. We did. John? Everything all right? I have something to tell you that I should've said a long time ago. Tickets, please. Tickets, please. It's something, isn't it? Feels strange. Things were simpler at Partick. This is the way things are going, Jimmy, at Partick and everywhere else. People want to watch this game. It's players like you and me they want to see. They've come to witness a war, just like Hindle and Marshall said. I'll catch up. We don't give them a second's peace. If they've got the ball, clatter them. If they've not got the ball, clatter them anyway. They might have some good players, but we're a team. None of us are paid to be here. We play for each other. - They won't stand a chance. - What about Suter? Fergus Suter is gonna wish he never left Scotland. - Sorry I'm late. - Where've you been? Where's ours? I haven't got my workers yet. I was up all night doing this one for our captain. New design, new cloth. It's impressive. Um, also, I wanted to say, um... this will be my last match for Darwen. You're joking, Ted, aren't you? We need you. This new opportunity of mine is exciting but demanding. I must give it all I've got. Am I to be cast into the darkness like Fergus and Jimmy? It's very smart, Ted. I'm honored to wear the first one. Let's show Blackburn who the best team around here is and make Ted's last match one to remember! How does it feel? It doesn't fit and it itches, but apart from that, it's perfect. Are you all set? Good luck, Mr. Love. Delighted to have you with us. Good luck, Mr. Suter. I pay you the most because you could be the best. Earn it. Traitors! - Boo! - D'you mind? That's my husband. No offense, ma'am. We'll shut them up soon enough, Jimmy. Is your head right today? Forget his head. It's his feet I'm worried about. I'm fine. I've been thinking of a way we can play together and get the best out of both of us. Tell me more. This is what happens when people are betrayed... - Judas! - Traitors! ...for 30 pieces of silver. I could do with 30 pieces of silver. Or 40, for that matter. It was brave of you to accept the challenge. It was brave of you to suggest it. That was a mistake. Fergie! That's more like it! - Yes! - Yeah! Judas! Emotions are running high today. Traitors! Jimmy! Stretcher! We need a stretcher! - Fergus, I never meant to... - You bastard! Jimmy? Let me through! - Jimmy? - I'm fine, Doris. It's just a wee knock. We should leave. Savagery. Total savagery. We need to get him off the pitch. - Where's my bag? - Here. Bit of a mess, am I? Is he gonna lose his leg? Maybe, if he doesn't lose his life first. We must stop the bleeding. It doesn't hurt so much. Jimmy, wake up. - Doris. - Here I am. I'm right here, love. I'm right here.
