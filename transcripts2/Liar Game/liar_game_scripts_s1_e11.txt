 Liar Game Hey, it's on. Why didn't you stay home to watch? Oh... I don't have to watch. I guess. You know what happens Hey, don't spoil it. Okay. A year ago, L Company... had the highest stock prices everyday at the time. I was trying to earn a lot of money.

 If only I hadn't gone into debt investing in that company... I tried to commit suicide by hanging. I tried hanging myself using a necktie on a hanger. But suddenly Da Jung... She didn't know anything. She straightened the necktie on me. By coincidence, I learned something interesting. Your father... becoming a wanderer in debt... is Ha Woo Jin's fault. Our staff verified Kang Do Young's words are true. Due to Ha Woo Jin's revenge, Nam Da Jung's father... Do you have to see the answer key to solve the question?

 Is that all you're worth, Ha Woo Jin? Who are you? What do you have to do with me and my mother? What happened at the orphanage? You still don't remember. Want a hint? If she only said such good things, why can't you remember that? What? You saw the true face... of your angelic mother. That's why you erased it... from your memory. [Liar Game] [Episode 11: Final Round I] What do you mean? What do you mean! It's not true, right? It's a lie, right? You... didn't do that to Dad. Right? It's true. How will the sad and shocking connection of these two continue in the last round? Watch and find out. [Lloyd Capital] Yes. I understand. I'm at the investment office. I'll meet and convince him. [The twisted fate of Liar Game participants. Is it really a coincidence?] It's not like you didn't expect this feedback. - It's too much. - That's why I prepared this. For now, in season one, make kind and stupid Nam Da Jung the winner. - In season two... - I don't need to know. About taking over the broadcasting station, we'll discuss it internally. Director. Let me meet... the Chairman and persuade him. Look here. I won't leave until I see him. Hello, Chairman. Yes, well... I hear you want to talk. Yes. If Nam Da Jung wins, I can win back the public. Or if Ha Woo Jin wins and gives her the prize money like he promised... Ha Woo Jin? Give Nam Da Jung the prize money? Director Jang. Why are you so naive? Excuse me? Do you know why Ha Woo Jin went to jail? He tried to get revenge on the guys who scammed his mother. Who said that? Kang Do Young? He's really smart. When I saw Ha Woo Jin on TV, I got so angry. That bastard told me and a bunch of others to invest in L Company. There's more than one or two who committed suicide because of him. Who was it? Nam Da Jung's father was scammed by Ha Woo Jin, too. From the get-go, he entered the game after conspiring with Kang Do Young. Those scammers. Then, how should we handle it? Just let Kang Do Young win the game. At any rate, that guy owes us a lot of money. There's no need to share the prize. That's why he wanted to do the show. What about the station acquisition? What happens? As long as the ratings are high, we'll proceed as planned. Thank you. However, toward the end, we'll need some scenes that'll spike ratings up. Like Nam Da Jung betraying Ha Woo Jin at a critical moment. Isn't that kind of thing the show's premise? Correct. Actually, I think Ha Woo Jin has some kind of past connection with Kang Do Young. We don't care about that. Just something to... ramp up tension in the climax. Use that. I understand very well. You can go. Yes. What should I do about JVN's stock? Once the fireworks are over, all that's left are smoke and trash. When we top ratings in the final round, sell it all off. Yes. Now that I see it, L Company and Lloyd Capital have nearly identical initials and logos. What's the significance? You seeing your mother's true face... What does it mean? I have no idea. Even meeting... Kang Do Young at the orphanage? What's this then? [Sungshim Orphanage] I don't know. Can you show me.. the materials? The USB. Why not? Do you suspect me now? PD. Da Jung. The broadcast... Dad... Where is he? What? You must have met him. Tell me where he is. I went back after the show aired. But I couldn't find him. - Even if you go... - I'll find him. Don't worry about it. I'm sorry. Don't say what you don't mean. Um... Da Jung. That's how shows work. They stick things together. Don't worry about it. Well... Have you talked to Professor Ha? I think... Professor Ha... didn't tell you sooner... I know. What if... your father became a fugitive in debt because of someone else? How will you feel? I'd hate that person a lot. Is that all? I'd want to get revenge. Since it'd be hard to forgive. He probably felt bad. Huh? Yeah... Right? He wouldn't have done it had he known. That's right. It's not his fault. Yeah... Right? Then... we're moving forward as planned? Ha Woo Jin wins and we share the prize money. Hey. You're here. You know... the reinstatement game will be recorded. The finals will be live. They said it's like Russian Roulette. Did you hear? Yes. Did you hear this, too? The three losers have joined forces to eliminate Kang Do Young. Aren't you proud? Hey. Where's Choi Sung Joon? No word? Not yet. Okay. Let's go to the set. Get ready. Yes. Before the game begins, the reinstatement game participant, Choi Sung Joon, is unable to participate for personal reasons. The kiddo... Is he scared? Who knows? Now... we'll begin the reinstatement game to select one person for the final round. The game in this round... is 17 poker. Like the names implies, A... J... Q... K... Each of the four suits making up 16 cards along with one Joker card. It's poker using a total of 17 cards. Each chip is worth $10K. Each person plays with 30 chips. Wow, $300K total. We should play Go instead. Along with a simple demonstration, the rules will be explained. First the dealer will mix up the cards. It's called shuffling. Then each player gets four cards each. Cut five cards. Did you see? Before the cards are distributed, say "cut," and the desired cards are placed in the bottom of the deck. The cards will be dealt from there. Right. If not, the dealer could be cheating. Verify your hand and bet. Everyone... knows the rules of poker, right? In this game, it's one pair, two pair, three of a kind, four of a kind. Only four scenarios are possible. To put it simply, the person with the most duplicate cards wins. Verify your hand. Will you bet? Starting with Bulldog. Betting means you raise. If you want to match that, call. If you want to give up, you fold. To start the pot, $30K. Call. Call. The important thing here is there's a chance to draw cards. Each card can be exchanged for a chip. Will you exchange? I will. After the exchange, you can bet once more. Will you bet? Let's say you did. Flip the card. I... have three Queens. The Joker can be used as any card. It's a wild card. In the practice game, with the Joker and three aces, Kang Do Young wins. From now, we'll play five games of three rounds making up a total of 15 games. The player with the most money wins the reinstatement game to join the final round. Let's begin. As a warning, since the cards may be folded or hidden... In order to prevent cheating, each game will be played with a new deck. It's similar to poker. Is it? This... is Liar Game. Don't forget that. Don't they have an advantage with two of them? In this round, they can't scheme, so we'll have to see. This game is... totally different than poker. They're playing with 17 cards. Due to probability, getting one pair is a given. In the end, if you get the Joker, like Kang Do Young just now, it's three of a kind. The person with the Joker wins. That probability is high. But that might not be all. Will you cut? One card. Oh, no... Goodness. After five games in the first round, Bulldog is leading. See you in the second round. Cut! Jeez, my stomach is in knots because I'm stressed. I'm going to the bathroom. Ow, my back. Where's the coffee machine? I'm gonna take a break. Kang Do Young is too quiet. What can he do? It's two against one. But they're not pro gamblers. It won't be easy to play by plan. I'll be back. What's up? The loan... Isn't that Da Jung's father? Where is this? I think I know. I'll be back. Alone? I'll go with you. No. If I don't come back, help Nam Da Jung win. Don't say that! The final round begins at 11. Don't be late. For sure! I'll kill you if you don't come. [Liar Game] Jeez, I'm so busy. Jeez. Ugh! I never... knew I'd say these words. I... have a way to win. Those are the same words. But it feels so different. What is it? I can see the Joker. Huh? The Joker? I may be like this now but I used to be an athlete. In 1994, I won the silver medal for middleweight boxing in China. Wow, really? So, what? My vision... is really good. Why didn't you keep boxing? I have a painful past. Don't ask. When the cards are shuffled, I can see the Joker. How many? Are you joking? Two. Don't believe me? Watch the next round. Before the dealer shuffles, he raises the cards slightly. The card at the very bottom is clearly visible. A card with nothing printed on the edge is an ace or the Joker. Let's say that's the case. I can't see though. Where'd you learn how to cheat at cards? There's a new deck for each game. I lost a few games and watched the cards carefully. It was the Joker. But you have to be dealt the Joker to get it. That's the problem. At... that time... Cut! Three cards. I call cut at the perfect time. I'll take care of the hands dealt. Shall we do it? Here. Exchange. Raise. $10K. Call. Jeez. Will you exchange? One card. Here. Jeez. Will you bet more? Maybe $10K more? Jeez, why go $10K more? Call. Call. Show your cards. What should I do? I have three aces. - Jeez. - Goodness, really. Thanks. The police aren't an errand service. Aren't we even after the car records I got you? It's a long story. We have to rescue him first. I have to know what it's about before I do any rescuing. Does it have to do with Reporter Goo's investigation? Related to Liar Game? Okay. Okay. Where do you want to go? That building. Where Mother died. Cut. Seven cards. Raise. $10K. $30K then? Wow, I got the Joker again. Three of a kind. Goodness. So sweaty... It'll be suspicious if only I do it. Cut. Four cards. Raise. $50K. All in! Oh, my, what do I do? Follow me. Jeez, this is troublesome. I'm sure it'll be a good card. What do I do? Whatever. I call $50K. Call. Oh, my... I got the Joker again! It's poker. Ugh! My nightmare is coming true! I'm going crazy. Sorry. It's a shock. Round 2 was swept by Bulldog who earned $800K. Goo In Gi has lost all his game money and is eliminated. Kang Do Young is in a tough spot with only $100K left. Hold on. I want to change the shuffling method. I think Bulldog... can see the cards. Change to riffle shuffling. Like this. Jeez, you're bringing up anything because you're losing. Am I Superman or something to see that? I was shocked as well. However, you got the Joker in four of the five games. To call it coincidence, it's too much. Jeez. That's how the game goes. It can happen. Yes, I suppose so. For a talented boxer... with exceptional vision. You were a famous boxer. Before you lost your title... due to fixing a game. Too bad for you. Right? Hold back. We'll change the shuffling technique in the next round per Kang Do Young's suggestion. Who will win and join the final round? Find out in the third round. [Under repair] [JVN Broadcasting Station] Let's begin the final third round. Per Kang Do Young's suggestion, the shuffling technique has been changed from the Hindu to riffle shuffle. Hold on. Bulldog might see again. Shuffle... ...once more. Cut. Eight cards. Then we'll get four cards each. And the Joker will be on top of the deck. Raise. $20K. Call. Exchange. One card. Exchange four cards. Four cards? Huh. Then... you only have $40K left. Raise. $40K. Call. It's three of a kind. I have four aces. Exchange four cards. Jeez, your cards must really suck. Raise $50K. Call and raise $50K. What? Call. Show your cards. I have three aces. Four of a kind again? I guess... luck is on my side now. Detective Cha. Detective Cha! Exchange one card. I'm going crazy! What's with my cards? I'm going mad. Exchange. Four cards. Again? Oh, my. I got four of a kind again. What? Go, hurry! Hurry. Raise. $80K! Should I tell you my cards? Four kings. If you don't have four aces, you should give up. Don't blabber. Follow me. Give up if you're scared. I call $80K. How much do you have left? Ah... Raise $100K. Will you go all in? It seems familiar here. Now that I see it, L Company and Lloyd Capital have nearly identical initials and logos. One... Two... It hurts. Hu Young. I have to go. It's not over. Let's do it again. What is it? What's this? This isn't real. The well... What? The... three of us were there. Give me the gun. Huh? Where are you going? I have to end it. Shockingly, Kang Do Young keeps getting four of a kind. He took the lead and the right to join the finals is in his hand. Hey. How can he keep getting four of a kind? Are you cheating? You two were the ones who cheated. You knew where... the Joker was. What are you blabbering? Well... I won't accuse you. It's no big deal locating one card. I know where all the... ...cards are. What? We used a new deck in every game. That means... all the cards started in the same order. I lost initially and... figured out the patterns. But... Let's say that's the case. But how can you locate the cards? It's not just one or two cards. I lined them up according to suits. Aces with aces and kings with kings. Four cards... ...in a row. What nonsense are you blabbering? It's possible. I didn't ask to change shuffling techniques because of Bulldog. I knew you'd see the Joker. Now after seeing the 17 cards. The right hand has 9 cards including the Joker and 8 in the left. What happens if you riffle shuffle these cards? Will you show us? I'll show you magic. King of diamonds. King of clubs. Queen of diamonds. Queen of clubs. Wanna see something more fun? Shuffle again. What is this? You were so focused on getting the Joker without being caught. You missed that the cards were arranged regularly. Since you cut the cards, you thought there wouldn't be a problem. But after you got the Joker, the cards remaining always were four of a kind. Goodness. The winner of the reinstatement game is Kang Do Young. Well... We're four to one. We won't lose, right? Why isn't Woo Jin coming? I know. It'll start in a few hours. He'll come. Did you find him? No guesses? You seem busy. Nam Da Jung's father... what did you do? If you ask the examiner the answer, will he tell you? Is a person's life a joke? I'm not joking. It won't be easy to go against you four. You never know. If I'm cornered, I might give you a hint. Professor Ha's here. He said he went to get some air. I just want... to play with the three of us. Like before. [Liar Game] The long-awaited last round of Liar Game is Last Man Standing. Each of you will participate in Russian Roulette to find out who will win and receive $10 million. Take your places first. [Player Position Selection] This is so heavy it seems real. It's just like a real gun, right? But it's a pre-approved toy gun loaded with blanks. You can rest assured. This gun is a .50 caliber revolver. It can hold five bullets. It will be loaded with one bullet. If you pull the trigger, the likelihood of firing is one in five. These are the game rules. From numbers one to five, you'll take turns going around. When it's your turn, you must push one of the three switches in front of you. Shoot someone. Or add a bullet. Or avoid. Spin the barrel. To the person you've chosen, pull the trigger. It's too bad. If the gun goes off with many bullets loaded, until it misfires, you must keep shooting. If three bullets are loaded, you can shoot three times. But chances are, two or one shot might be a misfire. Then... if you load five bullets, you won't fail. The opponent can avoid. If they chose to avoid, they can not only avoid all shots until their turn again, but they can choose one person ahead of them to take the shot for them. If the selected player also chose to avoid, the shot goes to the next player in line. The point is... you can't avoid more than three times. Moreover, before someone is shot, whether that person loaded or avoided, how many more avoidances they have left... You must consider carefully. Each player is given five hearts. Every time you get shot, one heart disappears If you have zero hearts, you die. You're eliminated. The dead person's gun goes to the person who shot them last. If four are left, the game starts over. When three are left, we'll move locations and find out who wins the game in a final round. There's four of us. You can't talk to each other from now on. Only when it's your turn can you talk. If you break the rules, you'll be eliminated. Oops. Each turn will take 30 seconds requiring a quick decision. Once a turn is completed, you have three minutes to prepare. Who will be the winner of... ...Liar Game? The five people remaining here will use the guns in their hands to decide the lucky winner. Let's begin the final stage of Liar Game! Standby. Five... Cue! Make your selection number one. [Round 1, First turn.] 20% with one bullet. The probability is too low. I'll save it for now. Right, Jo Dal Goo? With 20%, if all four of us shoot, won't one person hit? No question. I'll go ahead and shoot. [Shoot] [Confirmed] [Fail] I shoot, too. [Fail] You stupid idiots. Expecting him to be shot with a 20% chance is stupid. Just load. [Load] We're going to save our bullets. And shoot at once. I'll let you know when. [Round 1, Second turn.] Shooting at once. Good strategy. Do it. I'm going to avoid. Should I predict? When Ha Woo Jin tells everyone to shoot, I'll definitely choose to avoid. If I avoid, in order to make provisions for his death... according to rules, Dal Goo... Jamie... One of the two... ...will get shot. [Load] How dare you sell your drug? [Load] That won't happen. [Load] Three bullets. 60% chance... [Load] The first to go in this game has the advantage. We have to stop Kang Do Young from loading five bullets. We're all... going to shoot in the next round. [Load] Can he say that aloud? By chance, so he'll avoid? Yeah. If the person ahead shoots and succeeds, we'll see if Kang Do Young chose to avoid. If he chose to avoid, the rest can save up bullets. If he didn't avoid, we can shoot him like crazy. It's too tough for Kang Do Young alone. You think so? They can't discuss. Even if Ha Woo Jin orders when it's his turn, Do Young will hear it. If they... misunderstand... If I choose to avoid, [Round 1, Third turn.] you'll shoot each other and die. This will be... quite a sight to see. [Load] [Confirmed] Professor Ha. You can't just openly say it. I think he avoided. Whatever. Shoot. [Shoot] [Confirmed] [Fail] I'm sure Woo Jin thought of something. Shoot. [One shot success] He didn't avoid. You're caught. Shoot. [Shoot] [One shot success] Three hearts, three bullets. If we're lucky... You can't shoot. [Load] Why didn't he shoot? Ugh. The chances of three bullets being fired is too low. We'll all shoot... in the next round, too. Yeah. Make Kang Do Young avoid and slow the pace of loading. He's going to load five bullets first at this rate. I'll lose at this rate. [Round 1, Fourth turn.] This time... I'll avoid. Will you still follow Woo Jin's orders? Jo Dal Goo? [Avoid - Confirmed] Shoot. [Shoot] [One shot success] [Kang Do Young selected avoid.] You chose to avoid. Who will you turn the gun on? Yes. Dal Goo... ...himself. But we found out Kang Do Young chose to avoid. No need to shoot, right? Two bullets left. [Load] [Load] You're... ...not bad. [Load] Great. Ha Woo Jin got five bullets first because Kang Do Young chose to avoid. Now we just have to evade Kang Do Young's choosing to avoid. How much more will you run? Let's see you try. You avoid, Dal Goo. Everybody else shoot. Isn't that too passive? Jo Dal Goo only got shot once. Do they need to be so careful like that? No. If he doesn't avoid, they'll get hit by friendly fire and the casualties will grow. If he gets hit two more times, he can die from the four bullets in Kang Do Young's gun. If he avoids here and avoids damage, Ha Woo Jin's side has more people. They have an advantage. [Round 1, Fifth turn.] Oh, yeah. Your father... is there any word? Your father must have been shocked at the show. You can't answer, right? Ah... It must be hard anyway. You can't see your parent when you want to. It's painful. Mom letting go of her hand. I didn't do it. Kang Do Young was talking about himself. What is it? Did he find out where? Did you find him? No guesses? I do, but I'm not sure. The first to be eliminated can go find out. It should be me out of us. You stay, Professor Ha. It's good to test a stone bridge before crossing. But we don't have much time. The deciding move should be made. So the game will be over soon. Hmph. That moron thinks he's gonna lose. Right. It's no use dragging it on. I'll go. I don't know about probability cause I'm dumb. [Shoot] It's a good thing if I shoot and get rid of him, right? Shoot. [Shoot] [Fail] What is that idiot doing? I'll find out. Shoot. [Shoot] [Fail] Hey. The plan is messed up because you didn't follow orders. What do I do? If I don't shoot, we won't know if Kang Do Young chose to avoid. It's too dangerous for Ha Woo Jin to shoot with five bullets. But if I shoot and Kang Do Young chose to avoid, Jo Dal Goo will get hit. Please... Just one bullet. Shoot. [Shoot] [Two shot success.] [Kang Do Young avoids.] Now... Ugh! Jo Dal Goo. The probability that Kang Do Young with four bullets will hit Dal Goo ...is 60%. If so, [Avoid] [Confirmed] Don't worry, Professor Ha. [Round 1, Sixth turn.] Now... I'll send him off. Kang Do Young blocked Ha Woo Jin's strategy and has eliminated Jo Dal Goo. Jo Dal Goo's gun will be turned over to Kang Do Young. Everything will be reset for round 2. Don't worry. We'll do your part, too. You idiot, you ruined everything. Sorry! The orphanage. Orphanage... Acting cool when he's eliminated. What is this? The order will be reassigned. [Player Position Selection] [Round 2, First turn.] This time Kang Do Young and Ha Woo Jin's positions have been reversed. He's in a position to give orders to Nam Da Jung and Jamie. But in exchange, Kang Do Young has two guns loaded with a bullet each. If he chooses to load, he gets two bullets loaded into each gun and can shoot both. Let's start with Ha Woo Jin. I'm before Kang Do Young this time. If I load first, I can kill him for sure. I'll collect bullets. The two of you... make Kang Do Young avoid. [Load] [Round 2, Second turn.] Nam Da Jung, shoot Kang Do Young. Jamie, you load. [Shoot] [Two shot success.] Both of Nam Da Jung's bullets hit Kang Do Young. I got him! Good. Three shots and it's over. I want to shoot. But I can't kill him right now anyway. It's better to load. [Load] [Round 2, Third turn.] Shoot Kang Do Young this time, Jamie. Da Jung, you load. [Load] [Load] [Shoot] [Two shot success.] [Kang Do Young avoids.] Oh, no. Damn it. He avoided. Woo Jin has four bullets, so the chances he'll shoot and kill me ...are 40%. I won't avoid. Why not try it? Well? If he avoids, Jamie will be in danger. [Round 2, Fourth turn.] I'll lose bullets, too. Succeeding now... is improbable. If he loaded, he has three bullets in each gun. If he targets Jamie, the chances are 48%. If Jamie avoids, [Confirmed.] we won't know if Kang Do Young avoided. But... Yeah. If Kang Do Young has a 48% chance of succeeding, there's a 52% chance all his plans will go to waste. Nam Da Jung, Jamie, load. [Load] Woo Jin has probably finished calculating. Like I said, I loaded last time. Woo Jin determined I wouldn't try to win recklessly. You're right. If it was my normal self, that is. Now my chances... have gone up to 60%. Right now, probability... doesn't mean much to me. I can see it already in my mind. Us three. Facing each other. Listen up. Me and pickled radish didn't have a chance. I don't care that I died. You two... destroy that crazy bastard. This location has become a bloody battlefield. Let's move. Nam Da Jung, Ha Woo Jin, Kang Do Young. will begin the final round. See you in awhile. What is it? You should be quiet. I'm trying... to help you. There's something important you should know. What... ...is it? Don't trust Ha Woo Jin. What are you doing? It's the final round. Professor Ha is on. Is that a movie prop? Looks just like a real gun. The winner of Liar Game... and recipient of $10 million. The final round... Ha Woo Jin versus... Nam Da Jung versus... Kang Do Young. The final game begins! Ha Woo Jin... has a real gun. [Liar Game] It's time for us to take off our masks. Stop talking nonsense. You still don't get it? You're going to lose. And won't know anything in the end. Did I look like I wouldn't use the Joker in my hand? Trust me no matter what I do. I want to trust you, Woo Jin. I can see the end. It's no fun to drag it out. Make your choice. Did something happen? It'll be fun for you to hear. - You crazy bastard. - What hell I experienced... Stop it! Ha Woo Jin, you know!
