 Liar Game We will begin the Liar Game Round 5 Smuggling Game. [Smuggling Game field] This is the West Nation and that's the East Nation. The rest of the area is the border. But the problem is that each nation has deposited $5 million in the other nation's bank. If a war breaks out in this situation, that money will be held by each respective nation. Each of you will have a bag that can hold $1 million.

 Go to the other nation's bank. Collect your money and return to your nation. But you must avoid the eyes of the inspector. [Inspection Room] Now the inspector must decide if he'll inspect the bag brought by the smuggler or... whether to let it pass. If you suspect smuggling, say "stop." If not, you can say "pass." But if you say "stop," you must say the amount smuggled as well. In the case the amount predicted by the inspector is less than or equal to the amount smuggled, the smuggling is a failure. The total amount smuggled is given to the inspector as prize money.

 Let's say when "stop" is called out, the bag is empty. Then the smuggler was unjustly suspected. Thus half of the amount called out may be awarded for damages. But let's say the inspector called "Stop! $50K!" and the amount in the bag is more than that amount. ["Stop! $50K!"] In the case more money was suspected than actually smuggled, the smuggling is a success. You also get half of the suspected amount on top of that. [Half of $50K = $25K is awarded.] The final outcome will be determined by the funds smuggled and won in inspections, along with the funds leftover which were unable to be smuggled the team with more money wins. Da Jung, you're brave. Even though I can guess the amount, you brought money. Think as you like. Let me see. How much you brought. You'll get caught like that. Didn't Ha Woo Jin teach you how to fool me? N... No. How much do you trust Ha Woo Jin? Haven't you ever... ...suspected him? Why would I? By coincidence, I learned something interesting. I was wondering when... I should tell you. If the game ends like this, I might never see you again. I should tell you now. Your father... becoming a wanderer in debt... is Ha Woo Jin's fault. He didn't tell you, did he? What did you say? What are they talking about that it's taking so long? Do Young... You're a really bad person. What? Trying to make me suspicious with that kind of nonsense. Do you want to win that badly? Da Jung... you're funny. Stop. $50K. How can this be? It's $100K. Nam Da Jung succeeds in smuggling $100K from the iron fortress Kang Do Young. East Nation people, can you hear me? Kang Do Young being able to see the amount was just a trick. Nam Da Jung. If you give up your cards and let Kang Do Young do as he wants, you think he'll take care of you? That person wouldn't do that. You all know that! You can't use the mic, Da Jung. We're being tricked! Fight! We'll help you! What's she saying? Wasn't Nam Da Jung supposed to take $50K? Supposedly. Why did you do it? Huh? Why did you do it? Jo Dal Goo. [Liar Game] [Episode 10: Smuggling Game II] What are you talking about? Tell us. Why'd you do it! No way. The pickled radish betrayed us? Kang Do Young was never clairvoyant. After I saw him guess the amounts, I suspected he had an accomplice. Did you see that? Did you see what just happened? Look, look. Who the heck is he? Hey... I suspected it was either you or Jamie. Stop $100K. I didn't expect Kang Do Young to pick you over Jamie. You tried to hide your secret communications. Can you see how much? He guessed the exact amounts. But probably only told you the smuggling amounts. It was probably... through those windows. How much should I take? So, after deciding the smuggling amount would be $50K, I gave Nam Da Jung a note. To add more money. Then those fake signals or whatever... If anyone could do that, they would've already. [There's a traitor among us! Take $5000 more!] But the funny thing is, I told her to take only $5K more. But Nam Da Jung boldly took $100K. I got angry... at Kang Do Young for making us trick each other. What I don't get... ...is the reason. What proposition did you receive from Kang Do Young? Did you agree to give each other money? You wouldn't do that, ahjusshi. Right? I'm sorry. I can tell based on the expression now. How much money... will move that person. How much will move you? What are you saying? You think I'll move for a few bucks? It's not just money. Get Da Jung out of this situation. Enough money so she can... get out of debt and live happily with her father. You know, right? Why Ha Woo Jin is playing this game. What do you want to say? You wonder if innocent and kind Da Jung will get hurt. You're getting worried. You don't want her to keep playing either, right? Wouldn't it be better if she won prize money ...and forfeited? What did you say to me? This is what you do for Nam Da Jung's sake? Ugh, go out and die, pickled radish! I'm sorry. You did it for me, huh? What? Ugh, I can't get used to this environment. What's your fault? Kang Do Young is the evil bastard! Right. Jamie's right. I was tricked. I lost it completely. You stupid idiot. Idiot, idiot. Okay, that's enough. Professor Ha. We're finally... a team now. Let's go fight. Do you... have a plan? I have a way to win. We really smuggle. [Round 5 Smuggling Game field] In our smuggling turn, we take all four of our cards go to the other nation's bank and pull out all our money. Afterward, we hide it well. What's the use? We can't bring it back without passing the inspection room. We can bring it back. If the other side helps. How? We bring over someone to move the money from the East Nation. Then during their smuggling turn, they take the hidden money and pass the gate. Without passing the inspection room... If they come straight to our bank... Right. But that doesn't make it our money. That's why we have to deposit it again... ...into our accounts. Then we don't need inspections or whatever. The money just comes to us. Wow. It sounds good... but the money transferred is given to us in the end. Why would they do that? Why not? We'll promise to share the prize money. What's the big deal? Will they believe it? They will. We'll give them our cards. Then... We're going to give them all up? Wow. That's Nam Da Jung's style. Right. So, our winning card... ...is Nam Da Jung. Okay then. That should work. But why am I doing this for nothing? The targets for recruitment are Bulldog, Goo In Gi and Choi Sung Joon. All we need are three of our cards. We'll exclude yours, Jamie. That's not bad. But we won't have cards then. So all future smuggling and inspections will be done with your card. But... Who will recruit? It won't be easy. Who out of us would they trust most? M... Me? Like Nam Da Jung said, will we be taken advantage of by Kang Do Young like this? But MC Kang continued to succeed in inspections. Even if he got beaten once. Jo Dal Goo continuing to succeed in his inspections... Isn't it suspicious? I thought it was strange, too. What's going on? Da Jung was really lucky earlier, huh? Who knows? Oh, my... Why isn't it Jo Dal Goo? [Nam Da Jung] Will you get revenge, MC Kang? No. One of you go like we've been doing. Okay. We'll go then. Okay. Sung Joon. [East Nation smuggling turn] I'll get right to the point. Get out of Kang Do Young's dictatorship. Even if I want to, you and I are enemies. Even if the East Nation wins, it's obvious Kang Do Young will oppress everyone else. Think about it. Is winning that important? But in this round, I have to get some prize money. I already used quite a bit. If I fail, I won't have money to payback. When this game ends, do you think Kang Do Young will return your cards? Actually, I am a little nervous. I'll give up all the prize money, so join us. What? Wh... What do you mean? We're going to withdraw all our funds and hide it. Then during your team's smuggling turn, you take that money and deposit it into our team's ATM. Then, your team is sure to win. Right. The money you transfer... will go into that card. I'll give you that card. What if I tell Kang Do Young? This offer is being made not only to you, but Bulldog and Goo In Gi as well. If we confirm you haven't said anything to Kang Do Young by next turn, I'll take it as acceptance of the offer and give you the card. To all three of you. Then your team won't get anything even if you win. No way. If we win the game, the total prize money is $10 million. We promised to share that money. If you help us, you three are included. It'll be incredible if this succeeds. Will you help us? But Kang Do Young's feeling is right on target. He handles the cards himself. What if we get caught? After depositing the money into our bank, withdraw and hide it. What? Uh... Why? It's a hassle. So even if Do Young catches on later... He won't be able to do anything about it. Be careful he doesn't find out we're working together. Give us signs at the window letting us know if Do Young has caught on. Sign like this? Wow, this feels like a freedom fighter movement. Like a secret society. Cool. The recruitment is a success. Let's do it. When you were smuggling, I guess you had a lot to say. Not really. She kept appealing to my humanity. She kept asking for help so I just laughed. I'll be the inspector again. He hasn't caught on, right? We have to go out in the smuggling round to transfer the money. - I'm going crazy. - Me, too. What do we do? Kang Do Young came out again even though his clairvoyance was exposed. Has he caught on? There's no way yet. We'll be ruined if he keeps coming out. I'll go. I have a way to shake him up. Shake him up? I'm going to withdraw and hide the money. Give me your cards. Okay. Here. I'm going in. [East Nation] [Withdraw $100K?] [Withdraw $100K?] [West Nation smuggling turn] You're late. I wanted to try a fun experiment suddenly. Huh? Sudden momentary expressions or gestures... How far can they be controlled? Is it possible? I practiced in the restroom mirror. You must be bored. It was difficult. Even with long practice, it wouldn't be easy to hide them completely. They remain even if you empty yourself. Wounds and regret. Personal fears. If you're a person, that is. Go lecture at school. Oh, yeah. They won't accept you. What did you say to Nam Da Jung earlier? She was really angry. Was it something that didn't have to do with the game? That isn't a method you'd like. Well... as long as it's fun. Then I'm curious about something as well. During the President Game, in the first round, why did you eliminate Fortuneteller Pippi? Did you dislike her reading? A fortune where you'd kill your own parents? Kang Do Young, you were born with a good chart but you're a traitorous white tiger who eats his parents and owner. Voting for him will bring calamity. I don't really believe in superstition. By chance, are you... ...an orphan? That's no fun. What about this? The neighborhood you grew up in... was it Walden Two? I thought the name sounded familiar. I recalled an experiment I read in a thesis. Taking innocent young children and making them suspect, betray and hate each other. Ha Woo Jin. I thought it was a fake rumor. But I wonder if there was some truth to it. When I see you act like a ten year old child having fun while watching desperate people trick each other. Ha Woo Jin! What? I thought you were an empty shell. But now you seem human. Stop. $100K. Nice to meet you. Kang Do Young. [Liar Game] What's he saying? Didn't Kang Do Young immigrate with his parents who were professors? Who knows? Ha Woo Jin is probably taunting him. I don't know what it is, but it'll be quite a spectacle. Hey, what's up with him suddenly? I think it was really good I switched sides after seeing that. Why did he get so mad? He'll be back soon. Hey, good job. But what were you talking about? Huh? East Nation inspector, come forward. Why is my throat so dry? I'm going to rest. Whether smuggling or inspecting, you three handle it. Now it's up to those three. Give them the cards and tell them the plan. He's completely out of it. Thanks to that, we three will handle the smuggling turn. [West Nation smuggling turn] If you look near the bottom right of your ATM, there's a vent. All three of you need to transfer it without getting caught. It's around $1.7 million. It shouldn't be that heavy. But will we be able to move 340 money bundles in that time? We don't have many turns left and don't know when Kang Do Young will catch on. We only have one chance. Okay. Pass. The card... If all three of you betray me by chance and what happens if no one is there to report? These cards... Should I burn them up? M... MC Kang. Kang Do Young. Don't make the atmosphere too threatening. East Nation smuggler, come forward. I'm joking. What's with him? He was always arrogant but never that bad. Wow. Pass. Pass. How much did you move? Around half is left. What are you doing? But I moved more than him. Anyways, what will we do? We're in big trouble if Kang Do Young goes into the next turn. What would you spineless guys know? A man... ...needs power. Pass. That senseless Nam Da Jung luckily called "pass." I'm so mad. I'm back. What is this? Huh? Why did you give me someone else's card? Jo Dal Goo's, at that. Ah... I guess you have numerous cards. No, it's not that. Where's your card? I have it. Did it grow feet? How did it get to me? Let me see. If this card becomes useless, it'll be trouble. Th... That... I'm bewildered. Hey. You dumbass, why'd you fall for it? What's going on? It must've been hard for you three. Moving that money. Did you think I wouldn't know? There were two of you. I was in the restroom. Good going. I know. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Please be rational. Let's resolve it by talking. Jeez, holding the cards getting ready to burn them. I'm going crazy. Don't be scared. We moved all the money. Even if he wants to bring it back, how will he, huh? Yeah, that's true. It can't come back to this side. You're finished. Why would I bring it back? Jamie will help me. The money you hid sweating... I'll accept it gratefully. I'll be going out on turns now. Keep doing what you were doing if you get bored. The Betrayer Game. M... MC Kang. It's not that. It got quiet after a ruckus over there. It seemed like Kang Do Young lost his mind. They didn't get caught, did they? They were going to signal if they did. Betrayal isn't impossible. Kang Do Young rules that nation. We said we'd share our money. Why would they change their minds? We don't know yet. [Kang Do Young] Kang Do Young? I don't want to get bitten by a crazy dog. Then I'll go. I'll watch him foam at the mouth. What brings such an important person here? Have you regained your senses? Your strategy to win is... ...already ruined. Those stupid losers. Why does our strategy always fail? You should switch sides now. The money would've been yours even if you'd lost. What more do you want? Games are fun only if you win. I've never lost a battle. Put the money back. I'll give you two cards. It'll be double the amount if your team won. Crazy bastard. Do you see the answer? What do you think? It'll be hard to refuse this time. Wow, he's foaming at the mouth in the end, huh? Jamie's the best at pissing people off. Did you see that? Wow. They got what they deserve. We won, huh? It's all thanks to Woo Jin. No. You played a big part this time. Good work. Wow, Jamie. Did he say anything special? No. He's still like this. Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass. The game is nearly over. Aren't you bored? Want to see a fun magic trick? Come here. Ta-da. What's that? Magnets? Then... the cards... I'm sorry! For what? Oh, this? I wouldn't ruin the cards like that. It's all money. I told you it's magic. No! Excuse me. This is Goo In Gi's card. I think it's ruined. If your card is ruined, it'll be reissued, right? Reissued? Bulldog and Sung Joon, I think they're all ruined. Check and get them reissued. While it's nearly over, I guess he's even going to take what he promised Jamie. Do Young is very thorough. It's the last turn. East Nation inspector is Kang Do Young. West Nation smuggler, come forward. It's my card. So, I can finish up, right? Inside the bank vent, you'll find a pile of money. Move that. [West Nation smuggling turn] How did it go? Where's my card? My shoulder hurts. Did I dislocate my shoulder? You want more? Why not. For your hard work... Thank you. Did Woo Jin say something like this? "We won... ...Jamie." Old memories suck. I was really mad at Ha Woo Jin back then. It's pretty much over. Should we celebrate on camera? You're good at being despicable. I was going to anyway. That crazy bitch. What did I say? What did I tell you! Can you hear me? Good work everyone. Especially Nam Da Jung. Your activity was amazing. To think you'd give up all your prize money to win and actually do it... It was quite entertaining, thanks to you. What's with that crazy bastard? I want to keep playing, but I have to move onto the next round. [Liar Game] Kang Do Young won again? I thought he'd at least take care of Jamie. But he betrayed her after getting three fake cards. We'll have to wait for the Reinstatement Game. Only one will survive. How will he make it to finals after that? What? Let's see the camera feed. The center gate. Why is this here? What? What is? Didn't I... tell you to put it on our side? Oh, was that it? How could I move something so heavy all the way there? And... who rudely asks a woman to do that? What happened? Wow. In the end, Jamie... ...betrayed him. That girl... I never thought the day would come... ...that I'd like Jamie. She's the most attractive when she betrays. I adore her. Hold on. Now that I think about it... What? What is it? Did you think it'd end like this? There are three chances left to smuggle for the East Nation. Kang Do Young, return to your nation. Prepare for your last smuggling attempt. What is it? What's that? Tre... What does it say? [Commit treason.] [Commit treason.] [Commit treason.] What does that mean? You don't care if you're eliminated with nothing? You wouldn't give us money anyway. Stop threatening! Move, you wimps. What are you doing? Open up. Open up! Woo Jin must've known Jamie wouldn't betray. I thought they'd forgotten about the last turn. Well... Ha Woo Jin wouldn't forget that. Since ten minutes have passed, East Nation fails to smuggle. Second smuggler, come forward. Jamie. Why are you changing your character suddenly? It bewilders me. Who knows? I was really going to betray. But... I didn't know I'd do this either. Good work. Wow, Jamie. Did he say anything special? No. He's still like this. You're thinking of betraying us. Me again? Look at those three. What? They've been like that for awhile. Know why? They were caught by Kang Do Young. Really? They were supposed to signal. I don't know what Kang Do Young did, but I'm guessing they lost our cards. They were threatened. So, they can't send a signal. They are. Those three people's conscience. Conscience, my butt. Yeah, I betrayed you again. No, I will. What will you do? There's only my card left. Isn't it my choice whether or not I betray? Just try it. I'll break your legs... and get eliminated. You're going to stop me with force? Fine, go ahead. Go ahead! Ahjusshi, stop it. What! Leave. Leave. Only you can stop your own betrayal. So make a choice. When you walk out the door, what kind of person you want to be. Nam Da Jung, you little witch. She totally plays me. [JVN Broadcasting Station] Due to time limits, the East Nation lost all three final chances to smuggle. The Smuggling Game has ended. Everyone, good work. Especially... Kang Do Young. Yes. I'll reveal the results. The total amounts based on prize money and amounts unable to be smuggled are $3,412,000 vs. $588,000. The West Nation wins. Yay! This is all thanks to Jamie. Don't smile at me. I'll start to like you. Too bad for that asshole Kang Do Young. But in the end, I won... ...this game. The person who won the most prize money ...is me. The card I gave Jamie was fake. Your three cards are in my hands. 3/4 of it is mine. The rest of the people getting nothing is Da Jung's fault. You couldn't keep your promise to give the money despite your talk of truth. That truth is no different than a bounced check. What you're doing right now is called a mental victory. You never fight losing battle? You said money moves people, right? You have all that money. But where is everyone standing? Why aren't they moving toward that money? I don't want to say it but... you've come a long way, Da Jung. [Insert card.] [This card is invalid.] [This card is invalid.] I knew about the card reissue trick. Before you gave them to these three, I got them reissued in advance. Those are fake. These are real. Wow. I didn't mean to trick you all. I thought this might happen. So, I waited until the game was over. Here. The prize money as promised. You're really giving it to us? To go this far. Thanks. You were forced to cooperate after being threatened by Kang Do Young. It was tough, huh? I'm Bulldog. It was so hard holding back. Since you were bothered by your conscience, I was able to read you all and handle it. We started smuggling with the threat of war in 24 hours. In the end, it feels like the nations are united suddenly. This concludes Liar Game Round 5 Smuggling Game. In the end, you got here using Nam Da Jung. Didn't Anton Chekov say... "If there's a gun in the first chapter," "in the third chapter it absolutely must go off." Be careful. I planted a ticking time bomb inside Nam Da Jung's head. You be careful. The gun is beneath your chin. How are you getting home? I'm taking a taxi. Why? Isn't your bag heavy? Come with us in Dal Goo ahjusshi's car. Get in. Okay then. Ugh. Ugh, so heavy. What are you doing? How can a lady carry this heavy thing? Don't complain. What if I run away with it? Should I? Be quiet and let's go. Come here! Come in. You're the youngest, but you came the latest. I'll have to kill you. Stop it. Hey, did you store your bag safely? Why? What now? You think we schemed something? Did you two scheme something? Why don't you trust anyone? How long will you live like that? It's okay. I'm going to forfeit anyway. If we forfeit, Kang Do Young won't even have to play the reinstatement game. He'll automatically move on, right? Everyone's trying to pay back their mistakes in life and spent a lot of money. If we forfeit now, we can make up for the money spent. Don't worry. Everyone lives like that. Jeez... Why do I feel so empty? Are we really going to forfeit? I should've hit that little bastard Kang Do Young once. Yeah, Nam Da Jung trusted us so much. She even promised to share the prize money if she won. You heard it, right? But how can we quit now? The three of us men can't defeat Kang Do Young? We can't. Right? Idiots. What? You little bastard. Let's do it. Do it. Okay, let's do it. Okay? Let's toast. Here. Cheers! This is great! That was a good meal. Rest up until the final round, okay? I'm leaving. Aren't you leaving? Hey, I just remembered the car boiler, I mean the heater was left on. I'll be going first. Okay. I'll be going. Bye. Um... Let me use your computer. I want to check something. Okay, it's over there. I worked really hard finding this. I won't charge extra. But I'm going to quit. I have a bad feeling. Foreign investment company Lloyd Capital, rumored to consider purchasing JVN, is a hidden subsidiary firm of the major investment company Kang Do Young worked at on Wall Street. There was suspicion in the past the stocks shot up due to a rumor they'd take over L Company. His parents record is fake. His immigration record is fake. His records prior to high school are false. He was adopted into an American family twenty years ago? [Sungshim Orphanage] What picture is that? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to peek. It's nothing. There's only one round left. Yeah. Um... At the game field earlier, Kang Do Young said something strange. He said my father becoming a debtor was because of you. What? I can't figure him out, but... I didn't think he was a bad person. But why would he have said such nonsense. Did he want to win that badly? I planted a ticking time bomb in Nam Da Jung's head. Da Jung. I'll come to your cafe tomorrow evening. I want to talk. What about? About Kang Do Young... and... ...about me. Hello. Have you heard of Pandora's box? Don't you know what happens when you open it? Excuse me! Excuse me! Is anyone there? Help me! Help me! Do Young gave us this information on Ha Woo Jin earlier, right? Yes. But is it true? The company Woo Jin ruined is L Company that Nam Da Jung's father mentioned? Did you check the records? You'll show that, right? Well I... That is... What? Didn't Kang Do Young know it would be broadcast when he said it? If that's the case, yes but... What do you mean? With the final to come, what would be better to spark interest? But still... It's not the audio of the actual person speaking. The picture quality will suck if it's pieced together. There will be criticism saying we created controversy. Let's just edit it out. Why is there no audio? His voice was recorded. Even if the sound quality is bad, it seemed really genuine. Voice recording? If I just hadn't invested everything, I tried to hang myself back then. Does Da Jung know? Excuse me. Isn't that story incredible? It should be recreated and aired. Hey. Don't yell at him. Why are you acting like it's nothing? Watching Kang Do Young going crazy, do you feel like you should be alert? It's too late. Hey, it's on. Why didn't you stay home to watch? Oh, I don't have to watch. I guess. You know what happens. Hey, don't spoil it. A year ago, L Company... had the highest stock prices everyday at the time. If only I hadn't gone into debt to invest in that company... I tried to commit suicide by hanging. I tried hanging myself using a necktie on a hanger. But suddenly Da Jung... She didn't know anything. She tied the necktie on me. By coincidence, I learned something interesting. Your father... becoming a wanderer in debt... is Ha Woo Jin's fault. Our staff verified Kang Do Young's words are true. Due to Ha Woo Jin's revenge, L Company was ruined. Not only did Nam Da Jung's father go into debt, but he also tried to commit suicide. How will the sad and shocking connection of these two continue in the last round? Do you have to see the answer key to solve the question? Is that all you're worth, Ha Woo Jin? Who are you? What do you have to do with me and my mother? What happened at the orphanage? You still don't remember. Want a hint? Even after she said such good things... You still can't remember that moment? What? You saw the true face... of your angelic mother. That's why you erased it... from your memory. What do you mean?
