 But... what do these people do? They must need brains, too. A genius is hard to come by. Here he comes. Over there. That wasn't him. Hello! You know, from before... Don't you remember? Jo Dal Goo. Ah... When is Professor Ha coming out? Ha Woo Jin? He just left. What? Run! What's going on? Run! Run! Get him! Get him! Go! Professor Ha! Professor Ha! Why is he running? What? Professor Ha! I'm Jo Dal Goo! Move! Ow, it hurts. Dad... I'm doing well. Gosh, that hurts. Hey, where are you? I'll be right there. Hey. I caught the guy from earlier, but it's not him. By chance, did you see anyone come out after him? I'm sorry, but I have something to ask you. Did you just come out of prison? What is your name? Aren't you curious about the crime I committed? Violence, robbery, rape, murder... Which one do you think it is? I'm sorry if I offended you. I'm looking for someone named Professor Ha. I heard he's coming out today. I was wondering if you knew of him. Why do you want to find him? Well... I have a favor to ask him. Give up. I'm telling you since you seem like a nice person. It's better not to meet him. Do you know him? - Why can't I meet him... - It'll make you unhappy. That guy... killed someone who trusted and depended on him. Making a deal with the devil is better than getting involved with someone like Professor Ha. Oh, yeah... Professor Ha hates people like you. He really hates them. What kind of... ...person am I? Someone who thinks being stupid is being good. Did you find him? What does he look like? He's very handsome. But somewhat very annoying looking. Oh, yeah. You know that thing around the wrist. Beads or rosary? He always wore that. Ahjussi! Ahjussi, wait please! Ahjussi! Ahjussi! - Isn't that Nam Da Jung? - Who? Really? You're him, right? You're Ha Woo Jin, right? I heard a lot about you from Dal Goo ahjussi. I'm sorry to be so forward. But I have a favor to ask you. No. You didn't even hear me out. I know what you'll say. I don't want to. How far will you follow me? Until you hear me out. Okay. I can hear you out at least. Really? I have to use the restroom. Wait here. Okay. Agassi means young lady. Agassi, you're walking us out? Agassi. Where do you work? Here? What are you doing? I'm waiting for someone! Who are you waiting for at this hour? Look at this guy... She's waiting for customers. - Let's go! - Let go of me! What about playing word games sitting in prison? There's a police station at the end of the street. Or right here... do you want to go at it with me? Punk... Who are you? Me? The one she was waiting for. - That agassi was waiting... - Hey, hey, never mind! Let's try over there! Thank you. What are you doing here? What are you doing! You told me to wait. And you believed me? You should know when you are deceived if the person doesn't show up. Why wait until now? Are you stupid? Then when you asked me to wait, did you lie? Of course! No wonder you get taken advantage of by others. What? What did I do wrong? You're the one who told me to wait. Is it so wrong... for one person to believe another? Don't let it go. Mom, please... Don't let it go! Sorry, Woo Jin. Why are you sorry? It's all my fault. I didn't know you were struggling so much. About that time... I still don't quite understand. Is it so wrong... for one person to believe another? No... No... No... Mom! I... lost my $500,000 trusting my teacher. It's a TV show. I saw it. Well... I know it will be hard, but... can you help me get that money back? I'll compensate for... Do you know what you're asking? You're asking a prisoner released from prison today to take someone else's money. And go on a TV show. If you don't want to get hassled like earlier, go home immediately. Wait... ...please. Get lost! I don't want to help an idiot like you. Liar Game - Participant Contract Teacher! Teacher! Teacher! Teacher, please listen to what I have to say. I have nothing to say to you. Teacher! Teacher! Teacher! What do you want? Teacher! Why did you do that? You're not like that. You have to deceive each other to win the prize. Shouldn't I do my best since I'm in the game? I thought you were going to return the money bag like I did. Oh... That? As a rule... you get rewarded 20% of the money you found and reported. I saw the phone inside the bag, so I called. I thought I'd walk away with at least a few thousands of dollars. But guess what? $500K rolled right into my hands. Then... the reason you wanted to return the money bag... You still don't get it? We're on a show. Jeez... I was going to be satisfied with this originally. But if other contestants are like you, I think I can even go for the grand prize. What have you been up to? I'm sorry. With Nam Da Jung on the Liar Game and all... That show? It doesn't look like we can collect from her anymore. But it's still not over yet. If she wins... you never know. Yeah, right... Kiss the prize... ...good-bye. Forget it. Wh... what... what... Her life is over. Why... Why? You don't get it? All the creditors found out. What an idiot for getting on the show. Ugh... Once an idiot, always an idiot. Are you sure it's her? I confirmed everything. She's really his daughter? There she is. Hey! Where's Nam Hyun Sik? Where's your dad? I don't know either. Why not? Do you know what your dad did to us? Who are those guys? Turn off the camera! Hurry up! Hurry up and stamp your thumb print. What's this? A contract that says we'll have the first dibs on your prize money. Hurry up! Look, agassi, I heard you're getting $500K if you win. Go get your money. Hurry up and stamp. Stamp it. Hurry up and stamp it. How dare you without my permission... Hey! Who are you? She's mine. What use is stamping her thumb print on a piece of paper like that? You want your money back? Of course. Then bring an official contract like I did. Stamp your seal and get it notarized. The TV station people have pretty tight condition for claiming the prize. Be sure to confirm. I'm letting you know since we're in a similar situation. If not... this girl will probably sue you. Illegal collection. She looks lost, but... she's very vicious and manipulative. Did you record everything? They use that as evidence. Jeez... Be sure to get a copy of this tape from that guy. I have to take care of business with her. Give me the tape! Hand it over! Give it to me! Hey! Let me see your contract. Run. Look at them. Get them! Stop! How did you find out... ...where I live? Do you think your address is the only thing that's listed? All the details of how you'll be used to entertain the hungry viewers. And if you were to refuse that... you'll owe an enormous penalty. Your future will be more bleak. You didn't review the contract, huh? Or they didn't give you enough time to review. I reviewed it. This isn't just any regular show. Give up. I know somewhat. Hey, dork... What do you know? - If you're not careful... - You're the one who doesn't know anything. That money... Do you know what it means to me? With that money... I can afford to share a meal with my dad... ...once or twice a week. I must have that money... ...to even light a few candles on his birthday cake. It's just an ordinary life. Once I desire it, I can't give it up. I'll help you. I'll help you. I have a condition. If I help you this round, don't go back on the game again. Is that... ...all? There's more. I get half the prize money. What? Is that too much? It doesn't matter since I was going to split it with my teacher anyhow. More importantly, I have a condition, too. Promise me. You'll never betray me. How meaningful is this? It means a lot to me. Promise me. Satisfied? How about signature stamp and copy? Stop right there. But... why do you speak casually to me? You speak casually to me, too, then. I know I'm much younger than you... and I'm the one asking you a favor... How can you speak so casually to me from the get-go? Liar Game Recently, a TV station is creating controversy by putting a lot of money on the line to have contestants deceive each other to win. Even if our programs depend on ratings, these low quality programs will hurt the integrity of media... How is the reaction on the Internet? People are saying it's all set up and planned. I'm afraid to open up my browser. What do they say about Nam Da Jung? Lots of tension there. Some say they were annoyed that she acted so innocent. And some say they feel sorry for her and want her to win. What is she up to? She should at least squirm even if she gets stepped on. She wants to bring in a helper. Really? Did you get the profile on him? Here you go. Wow. He's good looking. But there's a problem... He got out of jail two days ago. For what? Murder... That's what he was charged with. But that charge was dismissed. Unfair trading... He's a financial economic offender. What should we do? The Director will have a fit. What else? He's a Seoul University graduate. Seoul University? He's not a student. A professor... Applied Psychology... He looks so young. He is. He's only 28. That's interesting. But once we air the show with him... It will be controversial. I'm just giving you my opinion. The decision is... ...up to you, PD. You treat me like a PD only at times like this. You're the one who sets up everything. You know the part about the helper on the contract... Did he... ...anticipate this type of situation? Not sure... Why don't you ask him? Forget it. Youngest Professor for Applied Psychology Department at Seoul University Human Survival Show, Liar Game $10 million hangs between trust and deception Does it bother you? I'll get used to it. I'm sure appearing on the show wasn't an easy decision. It's about money. Why would I refuse the money? You're the youngest person to become a professor at Seoul University. Why did you all of a sudden commit such a serious crime... and end up in jail? Then why would someone who is so well known in the financial industry... snoop around the TV station to eat off of what? Did you say you found it interesting to see people change in front of money? Here I am... Example of that. There has to be a motive. In order for people to... ...change suddenly. Did I come to the right place? Are we recording the "Human Story"? What's your strategy if you have one? Would you help me if I told you? Just like with Teacher Hyun? What makes you think we helped Hyun Jung Bum? You put them up against each other knowing their relationship. In order to bring about this picture. You're interesting. Ha Woo Jin. - Speak for yourself. - Why? Among the people I've come across, you wear your mask so naturally. Were you really a professor? What happened? I'll get going. You got paid by the show and everything. Eat before you go. Ahjussi says he'll come over soon. It smells so good! So good! Professor Ha. You leaving? You can't. Come, sit down. Eat before you go. Wow... Da Jung cooks very well. Did you buy some tofu? Here you go. You two don't look like debtor and lender. We don't work like that these days. Like a family. You're all talk. Wow, let's eat. What? Oh... You eat first. Tofu. Let's eat. I didn't think you'd help her, Professor Ha. What help? It's a deal. True, nothing's free. I'm happy with collecting debt. I'll meet my quota in one shot. We need your help with our work. Me? Help you? There will be too many limitations once we're exposed on air. You need to support us behind the scenes. Oh, wow... This ahjussi looks useless and you'll find out he's truly useless. Hey! Just because I was nice to you all this time... Really... By the way, this bean paste stew... How come it's so strong? This has MSG, huh? Huh? JVN Broadcast Station We're hearing all kinds of insults saying it's all a set up and commercialized. You want to bring in an ex-con to the show? I can hear the station website exploding! You think the media is a joke? You said the participants are weak. You told me to come on strong! There's a limit! You want to put a swindler on? The viewer ratings are going up to the 20% mark thanks to our show. Being the first ranked broadcasting station is... ...only a matter of time. How about this TV station's rock bottom image? We have to grab the viewership. We have nothing more to lose anyway. At the top level, I hear them say the show makes them uncomfortable. If we ever... get caught as an example... we'll go through the broadcasting and communications review... get audited... And our company that turned the corner? It'll be all over then. Why don't we record first... and decide after you view it? Let's do that. I'll cut everything out in the editing room. What? You have a complaint, Kang Do Young? It's too bad. He will exceed Nam Da Jung... and become the new grabber... ...for the show. What? Seoul University professor? A genius? He's nothing but a swindler. Who knows? That professor's position... ...could've been a fraud. That's quite interesting as well. How about this? If a young genius... ruined a successful company by manipulating stock shares ...for revenge? What are you talking about? Here you go. Where'd you get this? In the financial world, information is not only a team... ...but spells money. Is it reliable? Should I look into it further? If we're going to cancel his appearance... why bother... D-3 before the $500K game ends There are two things we have to do from here. Even with those things, we can get our money back. First... you declare war. Declare war? I'll get my $500K back on top of yours. Total of a million dollars. What are you doing? The second thing we must do is... ...watching him. Why must we watch him? The money should be in the bank safe. Near the end of the game, the team from the TV station will have to confirm. In order to retrieve his money, he'll stop by the bank once more. Oh, I see. Then get the money back when he retrieves it. How can he change like that? I can't believe it. Just focus on getting your money back. His name is Kang Do Young. His real job is, what... some analyst? His current job is the show producer and host. His English name is William Kang. What William, my ass... MBA... He must've played basketball, too. I thought a background check is basic in your line of work. Don't you get that info just by googling it? Just up to there. Look further. There's more detailed information in the back. It's in English. He did pretty good on Wall Street. His company became an issue in Korea for some time and... he was on TV several times. He had some important deals recently and... he experienced great losses. Is that why he's doing the Liar Game? How about what I asked? Oh, that? In the car. What will you do with all this? How about the other thing? Oh... Touch. First thing you want out of jail is the latest smart phone. Good job. Money. I'll pay you when we get the cash. - Her debt isn't her dad's. She had plastic surgery. - That's not it. You scared me! When did you get here? I told you to keep an eye on him. What is it? Oh, nothing. Give it to me. It's nothing. Give it. Really, it's nothing. So, give it to me. Really, it's nothing. - Give it. - It's nothing. Excuse me. Why? Can't I park here? Not that... There was a report that some suspicious people are roaming the neighborhood. How about enjoying your date at the park over there? The park? I didn't know. - Thank you. - Alright then. Thank you. He called the police. Teacher Hyun is in a rush. Go home. I'll keep an eye on him. Alright. D-2 before the $500K game ends But is there a point to this? All we ever do is watching him at his house. How would you feel if you were being watched 24/7? Come to think of it... he hasn't stepped outside his house ever since we started watching him. What we're doing is... cornering him psychologically. But the money is still sitting at the bank. What's the point? The fact that Teacher Hyun is sitting home all day. Isn't that strange? Well, that's... Teacher Hyun made a grave mistake. The $1 million we're looking for... it's in that house. What? Whether it's true or not... we'll soon find out. What's with the smoke? Are you okay? Who... Who are you? I came to help you. I saw the smoke from outside. I thought there may be a fire. Who are you to trespass in someone's home? Get out! I found this near the fan. Was it you? Playing around like this? It's a late introduction. I came into the game as Nam Da Jung's helper. I'm Ha Woo Jin. She's using the helper chance at this point? Well, that doesn't matter. Is that so? You'll protect the money on your own without anyone's help? What? I knew the money was here already. What are you saying? It's at the bank. If you're guarding the money 24/7 in the house, I'm sure leaving your house is nerve-racking. So, that's why you're home all day. Are you testing me... ...with such a lame theory? How about this one? What did you look at? There's no way the money's sitting there. Yeah, right. It's not that hard to find a briefcase like that one. The bank's secret safe was... bait to get Da Jung's money case... ...from the get-go. Get in. You probably replaced the money with something else. You prepared two cases of similar weight. In any case, you walked into the bank with them and... place them in the safe pretending they're real. Here, you keep the key. You gained her trust by giving her the key. But that safe can't be... opened by a key alone. The account holder must be present. What do you think? Am I wrong? I'll wager $1 million on the fact that you won't go near the bank until the game is over. Why? Because you're hiding the money in that room. Pretty good. But what should I do? You won't be able to take it even if you know where it's at. I don't care whether you guard me or know where my safe is. I just have to last until the game time is over. The money is mine. A safe? Isn't it too early to decide on your victory? I have a way to win. The $1 million inside that safe... It's ours. How dare he try to take my money? No way. Never! D-1 before the $500K game ends My dad bought it for me for my birthday. Give it to me. What? It's slow. Don't look away. I think the Teacher is becoming strange. It's understandable. He was confident enough to show us the safe. He got nervous by how confident I came across. He probably thought there's no way in the beginning. Then he gets more anxious. In the end... he starts to believe that I actually have a way to win it. Wait a minute. What do you mean you "actually" have a way to win? Bluffing. Sorta speak... ...just a lie. What? Then... you really don't have a way to get the money? Not yet. I knew the money was in the house, but not like that. But if we keep guarding the house, we'll see a crack. How much longer must we just sit and watch? We only have one day left. Are you saying you can't trust me now? That's not it. It's good to doubt like that. But you're picking the wrong time and person to doubt. You should've doubted Teacher Hyun in the beginning when he asked to work together. Finally, the first round of the Liar Game... end of the $500K game is tomorrow. Tomorrow at 5pm, our retrievers will find you. That's when the game will end. Once the confirmation of the serial numbers is complete, we'll conclude who the winner and losers are. He spoke so confidently, but... it was all a bluff. Right. It's all over tomorrow. Just endure a little longer. It's mine. It's my money. D-day ending the $500K game One more hour to go. The call cannot be completed... Teacher! Teacher, it's Da Jung. Teacher, please open the door. Five more minutes to go. Teacher! I apologize for guarding your house. I'm sorry, Teacher. Teacher! Four minutes. Teacher! Just this once... Please think it over. Three minutes. Teacher, please! Please think it over just once more. Two minutes. Teacher! Please Teacher! Please... One minute. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Who is it? Contestant Hyun Jung Bum. We're the Liar Game Retrieval Team. Liar Game Goodness. Welcome. The $500K game is over as of now. I'll retrieve the game money. Thank you. Teacher! Can you help me so I can pay off some of my dad's debt? Don't you remember threatening me to take the money away? That pretty face boy must've ran away. Jeez... Come on in. Alright. It's here. Please wait just a moment. Here you go. From now on... to verify... if this cash is identical to the game money we passed out we'll confirm the serial number. Ah, yes. Sure. Please confirm. But... will I be awarded prize money right away? Once the confirmation is completed, excluding the $500K already given to you, the rest will... ...belong to you. Ah, yes. Thank you. Thank you. Please confirm. Please. Yes, yes. Please confirm. You gain nothing by pretending to be good. I actually... got fired, not retired. For embezzlement. It's always that way. The victims aren't bad to start. They're slow learners. The ones who learn to rob to survive. Once this show is aired, my son will also find out what kind of man I am. I don't care. It's all for... him, so he can live a better life. Should I send in the Retrieval Team? No, wait. Did you find Ha Woo Jin? He's close by. Almost there. Who can it be at this hour? Who is it? We're the Liar Game Retrieval Team. Retrieval Team? The earlier team is working on it right now. They're almost finished. We're the only ones... ...sent by the station. How can that be? Those people there are definitely... Hey. - What are you doing? - Teacher Hyun. You lost. One of the guys we hired didn't make it. So, I made the show myself. Wow, I'm a good actor, huh? Was I alright? Dal Goo ahjussi. Nam Da Jung. You own this money now. What are you saying? I won. I'm the winner! Don't you get it yet? You just handed over the $1 million to a fake Retrieval Team. No. No. This is void. The game ended at 5pm. This would've never happened if you guys showed up earlier. As we notified you, we arrived at exactly 6pm. 6pm? You said 5pm for sure! I received the call. Hold it. This looks very familiar. Which one is the real phone from the TV station? No way... When I signed up for the show, I learned that all the notifications and reports are made by the cell phones. Touch. As I was watching you, I noticed that you always left the phone on the charger. The fake fire was planned in order for me to switch the phones. I was after only one thing. How would I deceive you about the retrieval time? In other words, this game is... Nam Da Jung's win. The winner for this game is Nam Da Jung. We'll take the $1 million of the game money and... as promised... we'll give you... ...the $500K. Wow... Wow... Take it. Hey, take it. Hey. Hey! Wow... Let's go. Da Jung. Thank you. I had no idea. It's okay. I lead it that way. I put it an hour ahead pretending to be adjusting your watch. So, you didn't tell me on purpose. The moment you believed the game was over, you really showed your despair. That's why Teacher Hyun was relaxed and confident about his win. Do you think you would've had that expression if you knew? Yeah, that's true, but... See... You really can't act, you know. I'll go now. Where are you going? Is there more? You won the game and you're the star. Supporting actor should go away. Hey. The extra will exit now. Here. The half of the promised prize money. Thanks. And the promise you made with me... don't forget it. Quitting the show? Of course, I will. Ha Woo Jin. I want to get an interview with you. Look. Don't you know you're breaking the contract if you leave like this? If you want to argue, talk to my lawyer. You have a lawyer? I'll find one if I have to. What is Nam Da Jung doing? I'm not sure. Professor Ha, Professor Ha, wait for me. Let's go together. Alright. Hey, wasn't my acting great? It's no joke, huh? Alright, we should do the calculation. Huh? Providing car, materials... Playing extra. I'm spending this money elsewhere. Where? Nam Da Jung doesn't know this well, but... she has to pay a penalty if she gives up the show in the middle. Half of the winnings. What's this? The moment she turns in that briefcase to keep my promise and pays the penalty, I plan on giving her this back to her. Professor Ha. Even though... my prison mates insulted you saying how annoying you are and how heartless you are... I still believed in you. Behind those icy cold eyes, there's a passionate heart that's beating inside. There's a brain behind the eyeballs. Right. A brain. Who are they? Do you know them? The ones in the back are from Nara Bank. The ones ahead of them are from One Kids. How can the competing group be working together? Da Jung. Can you help me out? Just like our original pact, even just part of the winning... Just a little bit, Da Jung. Hyun Jung Bum. Where's the principal? This is crazy. PD. Let's get out of here and call the police. Turn on the camera. What? Record it. Record it, man. Hey, ahjussi. How can you drive like that? Get out. Right. What are you... Ha Woo Jin. Get in. Around $70K? If you can pay $30K, that'd be alright. How about you? One big one. Why is your scale so large? Perhaps... is this your doing? How can that be? Wait! Wait! Please... Be gentle... Your son is so handsome. No! No, Min Kyu! Min Kyu, turn it off! No! No! Min Kyu. Mom, something's wrong with Dad. - Dear. - Is something wrong? Dear! You know the content, right? Contract to give up a body part. No... Since you owe so many people... It was a little vague to match the parts with the amount. We prepared it on one sheet. Min Kyu, turn off the phone! Please deposit it immediately. Before your husband gets hurt. Hurry up and turn it off! I'm here to persuade you. Not as a helper, but to join the show as a regular contestant. As you already know, if you win half of the winnings a helper can earn a place as a contestant. I'm not interested. If that's all you have to say, let me off here. Wait. Just a minute. There will be an interesting scene. Why don't you watch the rest? No, no! Stop it! Ugh, what's with you? You touch so naturally. Stop it. This is too much! Isn't it? The world is just too much anyway. Look at them. A person's life is... in shambles in front of their very eyes. But rather than stopping us, they're busy recording us. What's different about you, agassi? Will you... pay off his debt or something? Stamp it! - Stamp it! - No! How much? How much is it for you to do this to him? Total $250K. What a nice number. - Come on! - No! No, no! No! That money... I'll give it to you. This is what you were after. Did you already know Nam Da Jung will turn over the money to the teacher? Well... I think you misunderstood. I only gave them the original idea of the show and am hosting it. Forget it. Here is... Nam Da Jung's forfeit penalty. $250K. Ha Woo Jin, why are you paying the Nam Da Jung's penalty for her? None of your business. Is it because you remember your late mother? She liked to help others and... she helped people who were struggling without any suspicion. She even co-signed for them. Your mother. She was swindled and had lots of debt... ...and passed away. Mother... And there's angelic Nam Da Jung who's cornered by debt. What a twist of fate? Right? What is it you want to say? The incident from a year ago... Did you take revenge? The company you ruined... It was actually just a shell of a company. I heard the CEO died. Aren't you curious as to... who was behind that? What are you saying? Join the game. If you win, you'll find out the truths behind... ...your mother's death. Stop rambling! You'll be able to find out quickly, Ha Woo Jin. Whether I'm telling you a lie... ...or not. Rescuing Nam Da Jung and taking revenge for Mother. Which will you choose? Ha Woo Jin, it's up to... ...your choice. Liar Game Why did you do that? Well... Can we call it a day? You... are much more stupid... ...than I thought. What if they quit half way? No need to worry. People aren't that naive. I want to begin here. How I got to be here. Who I'm up against. I'll find out. What are you doing?
