 Liar Game From now on, [President Game I Introduction] I'll explain the rules of Liar Game Round 4, the President Game. The procedure is as follows. The candidates announce their campaign promises. Afterward, there will be a poll to determine supporters. You will have one hour to campaign. Afterward, voting will take place. When a winner is determined,

 the promises will be executed and the winner will eliminate a participant. There are two important points. The campaign promises and selection for elimination. First, the promises. Out of three promises made, one promise can be false. Before the candidate announces their promises, out of two buttons labeled "true" or "false"... If the "false" button is pressed, that promise doesn't have to be upheld. Starting now, the first voting results will be announced. In the first vote of the President Game, the results are... With seven votes total, candidate Kang Do Young becomes President. Yes! We did it! I'll distribute all the money...

 in the safe to my supporters. Ta-da. What is this? It was the same strategy as us. We'll start the elimination selection. Fortuneteller Pippi. I saw it! You have a traitor's fortune! The four of us are joining forces. You still don't get it after being betrayed by Jamie like that. - You idiot. - You wanna die, you stupid asshole? Jo Dal Goo and Bulldog, you'll be isolated until the voting begins. [Liar Game] [Episode 8: The President Game II] [Round 4 President Game Stadium] We'll begin the second vote. Hey, hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up and hold on! What do you think about my winning method? Ha Woo Jin. If you want to survive, you should be good to me. That's only if... your pathetic strategy worked. What? Aren't you all going to vote? How? Don't bluff. Even you can't have a way out. Hold on tight! I can... open that door. Hey, you. What the heck? This is... [Polling booth] You can't do that here. First... why doesn't Bulldog hyungnim go? H... Hyungnim? This... Why not? What's up with you? When did you join their side? I have standards. An evil role as an extra is a bit... ...so-so. Right. What are you doing, jerk! I'm dying! Jo Dal Goo, you asshole! Hey! You Bulldog son of a bitch! Ow, my leg. What's this? The first two promises Kang Shin Gyu made were true. The final promise is obviously false. It's over if he pushes "false" at the podium. One out of four will be thrown out. Will you be satisfied with a supporting role? Or will you play the... lead in turning the tables? The voting results are... 5 to 3. Jo Dal Goo wins the presidency. I'm... President Jo Dal Goo. Everyone... As promised, the contents of the national safe will all be... distributed to my supporters. Thank you. The safe... ...is empty. What? He said he'll distribute the contents of the safe to supporters. President Jo Dal Goo's promise will be executed. Yes! Yes! What do you mean the safe is empty? I don't know. But it's empty. It can't be. Excuse me. We want discussion time before the elimination. I'll give you ten minutes. What bullshit is this? During the game, they just acted like the money was deposited? Does that make sense? You messed me up inside. I trusted Nam Da Jung and voted. But I was tricked again. How can you betray me like this? Wow, there's no one I can trust here. I really don't know what happened. Why isn't it there? If you don't know, who does? Ha Woo Jin probably does. I ought to... Don't do it. I thought about it. This guy used a false promise in the first vote. That's true. Then you'll be eliminated now. The first promise was false and the second promise wasn't kept, so it's elimination. Elimination? Will Jo Dal Goo ahjusshi be eliminated? Hold on. That... How dare you betray us when we gave you a chance? What do you mean? The money Kang Do Young gathered isn't in the safe. What the... How dare you get mad at us? The slush fund... You can't say you don't know. What? Slush fund? In the first vote, Kang Do Young said he'd give his supporters the national safe funds. Since nobody got the money, we thought the promise was false. It was false. Nobody got money. No, it all went to one person. - What? - Is that allowed? He said he'd give it all, not share it equally. He hid all the money in one person's safe. Jamie. - She's messing with us. - Wow. Unbelievable. At any rate, the promise was true then. Isn't that you? What are you saying? Separate immediately! Damn it! I'm mad as it is. Want me to show you my safe? Yeah, open it. Just wait and see if it's not there. Let's go. COMMERCIAL BREAK There. Look! See that? How dare you get mad? Even Ha Woo Jin lost reason because of elimination. I have something to tell you all. Jo Dal Goo won't be eliminated. What? I ordered him to push the "true" button... ...in the first election. To lie outright in an atmosphere like this... I really... Don't be nervous. I'll explain why later. Push the "true" button. I did... as Professor Ha told me to. But that promise was nonsense. No way... you knew no one would vote for him? False promises are this game's biggest weapon. I thought it'd be best to save it for last. Due to Kang Do Young's slush fund strategy, it failed spectacularly though. But it's too much that you fooled Da Jung, too. Sorry about that. It's okay. If I had known, my anxiety would have showed. You're too nice. Let's just focus on the task at hand. We avoided elimination due to saving up the false promise. We took a hit, but we still have a chance to strike back. Their strategy was unexpected. But Kang Do Young is probably shocked to see us still in the game. Oh, my. Fists aren't everything. A mental fight is bloodier. But how do we counterpunch? Yeah. You said we have a chance to strike back. We have to find... the slush fund safekeeper and eliminate that person. Huh? The second person to be eliminated will be selected. Eliminate the safekeeper? Okay, if we eliminate them, the funds will go back into the national safe, right? Then focus on the... most important final election. Wait... How do we do that? In the first round, who voted for Kang Do Young? Us three, Goo In Gi and Bulldog. Along with Jamie and Lawyer Go. Oh, yeah. That's why you had me and Bulldog go at it. To confirm the safe, huh? It's not me either. Want me to open my safe? I know. There are two potential voters. Jamie and Lawyer Go. I get it. It's not us, so we opened our safes. But the one who's hiding the money won't open up. We might eliminate the wrong person. And the safekeeper will hold onto the money. They'll share that money with Kang Do Young in the end. Hey, don't underestimate Professor Ha. Now that I think about it, isn't it Jamie? He might expect us to think that and given it to the lawyer. There's a way to find out. We know Jamie or Lawyer Go is the slush fund manager. We'll tell Jamie we suspect her. And give her a chance to prove us wrong. We ask her to write on the ground. Jamie will obviously deny it. But in the lawyer's eyes... it'll look like Jamie's opening the safe. [It's not me.] Then we tell the lawyer... we've confirmed Jamie's safe is empty. We tell him we know he has the money. And ask if he has any last words before elimination. If so, the lawyer... will only have two choices. Open the safe and prove he doesn't have the money. Or beg. Save me. Kang Do Young made me do it. I'll give you all the money. Save me, Woo Jin. Woo Jin. Woo Jin, save me! Woo Jin! Woo Jin, save me! I'll give you everything! Save me! Woo Jin! Unfortunately... Lawyer Go has been selected for elimination. Now the remaining participants will prepare for the third campaign. The contents of Lawyer Go's safe will be transferred to the national safe. We'll take a short break before going into the ...final third election. Kang Do Young, that bastard learned all the evil tricks. Anyways, the $1.8 million has been transferred to the national safe. We did it, right? The exact figure is $1.85 million. What? Do you feel sorry for Lawyer Go? No. Like you said, betrayal should be punished. More than that, you're saying Kang Do Young made a true promise in the first election, right? But he didn't break his promise. We used up a false promise because we couldn't keep our promise in this round. Kang Do Young still has a false promise left. So, the third promise will undoubtedly be false. This is valuable information. In contrast, our third promise must be true. Make your choice... in the most important final election. Between truth and a lie. Which side will you choose? They found the slush fund hidden in Lawyer Go's safe. As expected of Ha Woo Jin. At this rate, Jo Dal Goo will win the third election and Do Young and Jamie will be eliminated. We'll have to wait and see what that guy... has up his sleeve. A slush fund? Jeez. You should've told me earlier. Sorry. It's okay. I acted out due to my misunderstanding as well. But why leave it with Lawyer Go instead of me? Don't you trust me? Or... Did you use me as bait since you knew everyone would suspect me? I wouldn't do that. Ha Woo Jin would've found out no matter what. It was my choice, so that I could... have you on my side. No wonder. But what now? The slush fund has been returned to the national safe. Lawyer Go was eliminated. Bulldog and Goo In Gi are on that side now. Is that so? Huh? Aren't you too relaxed? In the third election, come up with a good promise. Bring over at least one of them with sharp negotiations. Do you think the essence of the President Game is merely promises and negotiation? Huh? [Liar Game] Well... You survived, so it's not impossible. In the most important final election, show your leadership using these three as the focus, Congressman... That's enough. A politician... should release and gather funds precisely. It's time to step back and gather. What? The tide has already shifted to Jo Dal Goo. [Third election promise announcement] We have the final election to decide the winner of the President Game ahead of us. The final President can select two participants out of those remaining for elimination. Since the winner will also select teams for the next game... Please select with care. Let's hear each candidate's promise. Um... Voters... From... now on... I will relinquish... my candidacy... ...as President. Although my election is over, your election isn't over yet. When... I decide... which of the two... excellent... candidates remaining is better qualified... In order... to be a strength to that candidate, I will do my best without reward. You're going to get some money using the Congressional Assistant, huh? With Kang Shin Gyu's concession, there are two candidates left. But you know that concession doesn't mean losing voting power. Now... Candidate Jo Dal Goo, make your announcement. [Truth] I'm candidate... Jo Dal Goo. I... will share... all the money... in the national safe... equally to... each of my supporters. Since he said it'll be equally distributed, it won't be a trick like Kang Do Young. Thank you. Candidate Kang Do Young. If I'm elected, I'll give up all Presidential authority and go along with all of my supporters' opinions. If we vote for you, you'll do whatever we want? Don't lie. Candidate Kang Do Young has made an unusual promise. If he is elected President, to the supporters who voted for him, it can't get better than that. But this promise... is it... true... ...or false? Through a poll, we'll measure your reactions. [Kang Do Young] [No party affiliation] [No party affiliation] [No party affiliation] [Jo Dal Goo] [Jo Dal Goo] [Jo Dal Goo] [President Game Round 3 Polling Results] Why didn't Bulldog and Goo In Gi... They want as much campaign money as possible. Don't worry about it. What's this? Hey! Already? Hold on. Congressman. I... Do you know how much debt I'll be in? The money you spent for your campaign... if I'm eliminated, I have to pay back the broadcasting company. Look here. Don't you trust me? I told you the tide has shifted to Jo Dal Goo. They won't eliminate you if you vote for him. It's more important to earn as much as possible and advance to the next round. Earn? Act like you're on Kang Do Young's side. Then go to Jo Dal Goo's camp and ask for campaign money to secure your vote. Several times. Ten campaigns equals $100K. It won't be easy to act like I'm... on Kang Do Young's side. They won't stand by and just watch. Kang Do Young has requested an individual campaign with Bulldog. If Bulldog agrees, - See? - go into the booth. They've already started to move. Hurry up and join them. Hurry up! That thug has already earned $10K. Hurry up and earn money. Thanks for the campaign money. Whether it's nonsense, a lie or whatever, speak to your heart's content. $10K worth. I guess... you've already decided. Oh, my. Did it show? You should've picked who to betray more carefully. I don't let betrayers go. If there weren't cameras around, you'd be dead already. Betrayal? What did Ha Woo Jin say? Did he say I hid the slush fund in the first round? Maybe or maybe not. So, he probably said... I still have a chance to make a false promise. So... it's not true? It's the exact opposite. Ha Woo Jin... is really amazing. How did he think of a slush fund trick? Before I heard from Jamie, I didn't even know it was possible. Ha Woo Jin thought it up? What is that? I think Ha Woo Jin used the slush fund trick and is blaming it on me. Jo Dal Goo's second promise wasn't false. He hid away... ...the slush fund. The side who has a false promise left... ...is Jo Dal Goo. You're trying to confuse me. Hold on. It seemed like you showed him your safe. Did Ha Woo Jin... show you his safe? No. He probably put the money in Nam Da Jung or his own safe and put on an act. But I don't have any way to prove what I'm saying is true. It can't be helped. Even if you don't believe me, I can't help it. Except to pledge my honesty. If I do this... Long time no see. No one can hear from outside, right? What now? What are you going to do? I'm going to vote for Jo Dal Goo. Kang Do Young can't win. Betrayal is part of who you are. But... Ha Woo Jin, Nam Da Jung, Choi Sung Joon, Bulldog and you. Congressional Assistant and now me. Seven people is too many. Well, so? What was Jo Dal Goo's promise? The money has to be equally divided. The more people there are, the less profit. That's true. Forget the original members of Dal Goo's camp. Do something about Bulldog and the Congressional Assistant. What can I do about it? I'll pretend to vote for Kang Do Young. And you tell those guys to vote for Kang Do Young. Then you, me, Congressional Assistant and Bulldog can win with four votes. Why make it so hard? If those two go to that side, the number will decrease by two, right? Oh... As expected. Oppa, you're quick. Congressman Kang who said he'd share his power with the people... how does he see the state of affairs? He said the tide has shifted to Jo Dal Goo. Is that... ...the case? Is that how you see it? Do you remember the reason I said... I created... ...this show? To show the true face of people in front of a great amount of money. That's what you said. What do you think? Seeing the true face of Congressman Kang? The way I see it, Congressional Assistant... No... Bong Geun. You shouldn't work for someone like Kang Shin Gyu. The ability to read the signs and realizing an ideal... You're much better than him. Am I wrong? What do you want to say? I'm not asking for your vote. I'm telling you to make your own decision. Your third promise... is it true... ...or false? Will you believe me if I tell you? - I'd have to hear first. - I can tell you easily. But why is whether it's true or false important? What? Were elections ever about promises? Winning is important. But look at the big picture. This game is a race to the next game and winning the game overall. This is just the start. Who will survive? Think it over. I heard in passing. Goo In Gi told Bulldog that he'll vote for Kang Do Young. It's okay if that's the case. How come? Why is Goo In Gi saying that? He wants to earn as much as possible. What? Even if we win, we'll have to divide the funds equally. He wants to increase profits by sending some to the other side. No matter who turns their back on us, Goo In Gi is voting for us. We're assured of at least four votes. You can relax. People are selfish. Doing this, can we learn the truth? What do you want to say? Throughout the game, it's bothered me. Punishment for betrayal. Reward for trust. People aren't test subjects. Fearing betrayal and trusting to earn a guarantee... Is that real trust? Can't we truly trust each other? - If we show them real trust... - There isn't. The truth you're talking about is chosen by those who can't determine gains or losses or is a simple tool chosen by those who have something to hide. What is truth or a lie... What's the better choice... we have to make them realize it. The game is becoming disarrayed. Kang Do Young... I thought he'd keep his reputation as an MC. But he's trying to survive by showing his ugly side. So... Congressional Assistant is voting for Kang Do Young? Did your dear elder order you to say that? No. It was my decision. See? The tables are slowly turning. Did you hear as well? That Dal Goo is lying? What do you mean? Jamie didn't tell you, huh? I thought so. What is that bitch up to now? What is it? Kang Do Young... didn't even think of the slush fund trick. Then... The one who hid the slush fund wasn't Kang Do Young. It was that swindler, Ha Woo Jin. What? Look at this. We opened our safes, but... did Ha Woo Jin, Nam Da Jung and Choi Sung Joon open theirs? No. That jerk Ha Woo Jin hid the money in his or Nam Da Jung's safe and put on an act. If so, the promise to give everything was a lie in the second round. Right. Since Kang Do Young collected taxes and put it in the national safe, he used up his false promise. Then the third round... Kang Do Young said Ha Woo Jin... No, I mean Jo Dal Goo... - made a false promise? - Do you have any proof? Nam Da Jung didn't seem to be hiding anything. Ha Woo Jin might have lied to her. The way I see it... Kang Do Young is telling the truth. Why? He didn't tell me all that. He told me to choose because either side might be telling the truth. But... he seemed to be telling the truth. Truth... If so, think of how... honest Nam Da Jung has been. Da Jung, yes, but think of how much Ha Woo Jin... ...fooled us. - Really. - Oh, my. There's no way to know the truth for sure. Who are you voting for? Kang Do Young, huh? Oh... Um... Of course. What's this? That weird expression. It's not that. Um... Jeez, what's going on? What? It's dangerous. Why? Can you hear them? It doesn't look good. We need a surefire strategy. What's that? Show everyone... ...our safes. I request a group campaign. Candidate Kang Do Young has requested a group campaign. Everyone gather in front of the main stage. We're one step behind. Due to time limits, this campaign will be the last. Once the campaign is over, we'll go right into voting. Everyone is about to vote for the final President. I know you're conflicted. Now... Who should you choose? I want everyone to trust themselves. If a long, complicated explanation is required, it's probably not the truth. Why? The truth... ...is simple. Rather than saying truth is on my side with complicated explanations, I hope you'll join my side since you can determine the truth yourselves. He's a slick talker. No wonder the atmosphere seemed... We have to change the flow. Anything to say? It sounds like you're saying authenticity isn't important. Aren't you acknowledging your last promise was false? If so, Ha Woo Jin... do you have any way to prove the truth? I do. Open our safes and show everyone. If none of us have the slush funds, the one who's lying... ...is you. You could have open the safes a long time ago. Why during my campaign? I'm not trying to sway people. I want to give the opportunity to decide the truth to the people here. If the safes are empty, what changes? In the end, whether you share the money or not, you can't know anything besides the fact that the money is in the national safe. We can prove we didn't hide the slush fund. What's important now... is that the safe is full of national funds. That... belongs to the participants. Is it important who and how it got there? More than that, how will it be distributed? For that, all you need to think about is who you'll vote for. So, you're going to avoid it. Even if you open the safes, you'll just increase voter confusion. Moreover, I'll give you time. What do you think about using Da Jung to plead the truth? She can't lie. She's tender-hearted. Since she's rescued many participants, if she speaks... it might move the participants here. How about it? A close look at the truth... or pleading the truth... What will you choose? I choose the truth. Good. If so, I'll give you a chance. But wage a simple bet with me and only if you win. It's very simple. We can play this game with a coin. Let me borrow a coin. Lee Yoon Joo. Cut it off. There's no time. We still have plenty of time. Give it to him. The person who throws the coin attacks. The one who guesses is the defense. The attacker must decide whether it's heads or tails. They can tell the truth. Or a lie. The defender has to determine whether it's true or a lie. Easy, right? Everyone here knows that Ha Woo Jin's skill... ...is amazing. Ever since his days as a professor, he was called a human lie detector. The rumors were everywhere. He can tell whether someone is lying or not with one glance. If it's someone skilled like Ha Woo Jin, a simple game like this... will be easily won. What do you think? Will you do it? Woo Jin, I feel... You won't find out the answer like this. I told you. If you want to know the truth, win the game. The game will get harder because you broke the rules. The enemies will get stronger. Of course, it... might be more fun for me. I'll do it. [Liar Game] If the attacker succeeds, and the defender can't tell whether it's true or false, They get a point. But if the defender is correct, the score doesn't change but they become the attacker. They toss the coin. The first person to reach seven points... ...wins. Give up if you're trying to kill time. I'll end it soon. Go ahead. Will you go first? No. You're relaxed as expected. Then... My coin... ...is heads. I don't remember well. Was heads a picture? What was on it? A picture of a mask. Tails has the number thousand. False. The coin is tails. Indeed. What is this? My heart is clenched. It's my turn to guess. Heads. False. True. [Woo Jin: 1 Do Young: 0] Heads. False. True. [Woo Jin: 2 Do Young: 0] Tails. False. True. [Woo Jin: 3 Do Young: 0] This is more boring than I thought. That bastard should know who he's up against. Tails. False. That's right. My coin... ...is tails. True. Do Young barely got it right after four tries. Woo Jin always gets it right the first time. He must've thought he was a god or something. You got what's coming. I barely got the right to attack. You acted like there were no tricks to the simple game. But the game is more advantageous to the hider, not the guesser. I discover the lie quickly. But I can't get points that way. You probably wanted to kill time as the right to attack went back and forth. That kind of chance luck... It won't work with me. Is that what you think? What do I do? This time... I was relaxed, too. What? Until now, I was going easy on you. Don't believe me? Do I... look like I'm lying? Now. Let's... ...keep going. The coin I'm holding... ...is tails. False. Give it here. You're wrong for the first time. Now. Shall we keep going? This time also... it's tails. False. Oh, no. It's true. [Woo Jin: 6 Do Young: 2] [Woo Jin: 6 Do Young: 3] [Woo Jin: 6 Do Young: 4] [Woo Jin: 6 Do Young: 5] [Woo Jin: 6 Do Young: 5] [Woo Jin: 6 Do Young: 6] One point left. If I win one more point, I can overturn the game. Wouldn't you... rather rely on luck? It's heads. By chance, is he knowingly acting like it's a lie? He's manipulating his physical gestures? That's impossible. I can't see anything. Only one way left. True. False. [Woo Jin: 6 Do Young: 6] [Woo Jin: 6 Do Young: 7] You're obsessing on the game. You've lost your substance. People don't care about the truth. They believe what they want. Then it... becomes the truth. Around 30 seconds left. Even for Ha Woo Jin... figuring out true or false... is... hard for him. We might have... overestimated Ha Woo Jin. Now. The... time to make a decision is near. Remove yourself from the complicated trick of trying to tell truth from a lie. Just... think it over. The final President decides teams for the next rounds. Don't you want... to join the team that's more able and likely to win? Become citizens... of the winning nation. [Round 3 Voting Start] Hey. Who will you vote for? There are four kinds of elections. Regular elections, equal elections, direct elections... and secret elections. Don't you know? Aren't you going to step foot in Yeouido again? Don't you want to do politics? Not with you, Congressman. What? The results of the President Game Round 3! [President Game Round 3 Voting Results - Jo Dal Goo 3 Kang Do Young 4] With four votes to three, Kang Do Young wins. Kang Do Young! Kang Do Young! Candidate Kang Do Young has become President. Come to the front. You'll give up Presidential authority and follow your supporters' opinions. You made an unexpected promise. How will you go about it? Yes. Thank you. I want to thank my supporters... and simultaneously... ...apologize. My final promise... ...was a lie. The game money and the national funds will be confiscated. However, don't be too disappointed. I'll reward my supporters thoroughly. Bulldog. Yes! Yes! Goo In Gi. Yes. Congressional Assistant. Yes. Jamie. Come to the front. $600K. Please take care of me during the next game. Thank you! In Gi. Let's do well. Congressional Assistant. Thank you for your brave decision. Thank you. Jamie. This money... for playing the biggest part in my win... You don't have to be so formal between us. I'll give it to the eliminated lawyer. That's all. What? Hold on, hold on! What are you doing? There's still a lot left! I need to use that separately. What about me? What about me! I'll give you a bigger reward, Jamie. If you show greater loyalty to me in the next game. You... can't do this to me. Why not? Tell me. Can I go into the elimination selection immediately? Go ahead. The first to be eliminated... Congressman Kang Shin Gyu who showed us the current state of politics. The second to be eliminated... ...Ha Woo Jin? Don't look so depressed because you lost once. It's no fun. Kim Bo Geun. Yes? When Liar Game is over, what will you do? I'll... run in the... next election under no party affiliation. What? For which district? I'll run in the district... I know best... the same as the former Congressman Kang Shin Gyu. You jerk! Outstanding decision. To go against a veteran like Congressman Kang, you'll need election funds. I'll help you. I'll give you my remaining $900K prize money. And I'll... ...eliminate you. Watching the game as the host, I was deeply moved by Da Jung's decision, which gave the eliminated participants... a new path in life. So, I also want to give you a chance. Hey! Until now, you cleaned up my ashtrays! Hey! See you at the election. Take care. You ungrateful traitor! With the elimination of the Congressional Assistant and the Congressman, the President Game is completed. We'll see the contestants who have survived in the next round, the Smuggling Game. What's with that jerk? Being generous to prevent adversity? Does he really want to win or what? You knew in advance that Kang Do Young would join, huh? What are you talking about? That crazy bitch Jamie... The one who supported Jamie was you, wasn't it? So? Are you saying I'm plotting with Jamie to support Kang Do Young? Can you say that after seeing what just happened to Jamie? I just... wonder if... you and Jamie are both manipulated by Kang Do Young. I'm concerned. Director. I don't know what Do Young is up to with this game. But I'm not going to let him do as he likes from now on. This... ...is my show. Did I tell you? I've never lost a battle. It was fun. I'll look forward... ...to the future. Thank you. Sorry for being a bad candidate. No. It's not your fault, Dal Goo. Jeez! You... It's your fault, Professor Ha. You! You! Ahjusshi. I'll be going. Leave, damn it! You said you'd protect Da Jung. You said you'd win! Stop drinking. Why did you get taken in by that jerk Kang Do Young? Hey. Do you know how frightening Kang Do Young is? He's too drunk. I'll take him home. Get up. You jerk... Woo Jin. Don't blame yourself. You can't always win. We still survived. We'll have another chance. You... Don't trust me too much. Yeah. See you. Professor Ha, you... Don't trust him! You tell the truth. Nam Da Jung or Kang Do Young... Professor Ha. No... Ha Woon Jin. If you're using Da Jung for your revenge, I'll kill you. Okay? Why are you going this far... for Nam Da Jung? Da Jung? Didn't I tell you why I went to jail? As you know, I'm not the type to scam someone. I'd get scammed instead. Then... For someone else? There was a bad woman. She was my first love. She betrayed me after I went to jail for her. I decided then. To never trust anyone again. Severely. Live severely from now on. So, you became a loan shark. But the first person you met was Nam Da Jung? She is too kind. She's always tricked by others. It reminded me of... I want her to live well. In this shitty world, that dummy... I want her to be happy. Ugh. Ugh. I remembered about President Bae. What that asshole said. Kang Do Young, that bastard... ...isn't a human. He's... ...completely empty inside. I... only work with humans. That's what he said. That he's not human. That he's empty inside. It's strange. Fortuneteller Pippi went up to the mountains after selling her shop. But when I looked into the real estate records, it sold for much higher than market value. And Lawyer Go was scouted by a prestigious law firm. When I met him, he said he misunderstood the show. He looked into how the prize money had to be returned after elimination. The funds were handled by a foreign finance company. There was no illegalities. It smells fishy, right? Sunbae. Don't you care about your investigation? Kang Do Young's background information... Did you bring it? You said you saw it already. More than that, is something wrong? By chance, have you heard about a person [Micro-expressions: very brief facial expressions, lasting only a fraction of a second.] who can control their micro-expressions? That's... such a fast expression or movement. You can't control that. That's why only someone with training like you can see them. Kang Do Young can do it. No way. I've never seen it before either. But there's something there. Then... he's your rival. A natural enemy. While he worked for the Wall Street... He lived in a college dorm before. His previous address... What is it? Walden Two? Where is that? How could I have missed this? Why? Do you know it? Walden Two. There's no place like that in the US. What? No way. This isn't his real address. It's the name of an imaginary town created by psychologist B.F. Skinner. It's known in rumors. But around 20 years ago in the US it's the name of a hideous experiment. Walden Two Project. You spent a lot of your prize money, right? The money I won in this round... I'll give it to you. Meet your daughter. What you need right now, Director Jang... You called me, right? Your debt... Talk to me for a little while. Producer Lee has met Nam Da Jung's father. I don't think it's for the show. Really? Wait and see. [Liar Game] Damn it, that poor wench! If her father hadn't invested everything, L Company or whatever... Where did she invest? Da Jung's father went broke because of your revenge, sunbae? I'm going to look into it. How and why did I get here? Who am I up against? Aren't you curious, Da Jung? Why Ha Woo Jin is helping you? Have you ever heard about Ha Woo Jin's mother? You, me and Nam Da Jung have a connection, huh? You... know me, huh?
