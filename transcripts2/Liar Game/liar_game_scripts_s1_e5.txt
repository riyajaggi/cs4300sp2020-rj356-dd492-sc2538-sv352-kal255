 Liar Game Um... Da Jung. I thought about it. With your prize money, how about repaying that first? I know it's not an easy decision. I know the TV station will ask for it back if you get eliminated. But you can repay it slowly. They won't charge high 40-50% interest rates like us. Right? Are you sleeping?

 Okay. That scared me. Who is it at this hour? Professor Ha. Where are you? By chance, Nam Da Jung's house? I'm not a guard dog watching her house. I just stopped by. Why? I didn't repay the debt from the $500K game. I was wondering what it was. Why now? Forget it. Why do you think I called? I thought you called because of Da Jung. She earned money, but she was depressed. I figured you'd told her off. Are you a mind-reader now?

 A karaoke dog can sing a chorus after three years. Get going. Oh, yeah. Da Jung's sleeping, so don't call and wake her. I wasn't planning on calling. Just in case she wakes up. She collapsed as soon as she got home. You make it sound like she shouldn't wake up. Professor Ha, you should stop being so paranoid. Anyways, I'm busy. About Nam Da Jung's debt... Huh? Is your company saying anything? Telling you to bring her prize money? It's my responsibility to collect debt. Why would they? Really? You know how Da Jung is. She's so kind-hearted. But she goes through one difficulty after another. I explained her situation thoroughly. Since you're taking care of her, I guess I don't have to. You don't have to say all that. Forget it. I'm busy, so I'll call you later. Um... This... I'm not stealing this. No? Are you repaying the debt? Hey. The creditors will harass her while she's on the show. She can pay it off and tell the station she'll pay them back slowly. She doesn't have to pay them back either. She'll be sued for breach of contract. She'll probably have to pay a fine, too. Whatever. Whatever they do will be legal. Hey. It's still better than dealing with thugs. Get lost. If you want to improve your work performance that badly, do as you like. What? Nam Da Jung... it's too bad for her. It's not enough to struggle with her father's debt. Now she's going into bigger debt herself. What about you? You said you'd pay back her debt. What's the big deal about not keeping her promise to quit? That poor girl. Who's the one making her go on the show, huh? Ow. Damn it. Remember the creditors who came after Teacher Hyun? That was... Kang Do Young's doing. - Huh? - It might be way more... dangerous being indebted to them than being harassed by creditors. What if Da Jung loses? Help her, Professor Ha, okay? This is a survival game. Nam Da Jung and I have to each survive separately. How can she survive by herself, huh? Damn it! That poor wench. If only her father hadn't invested everything into that damned L Company or whatever. Why did he have to buy stocks with borrowed money into a corrupt stock scheme? What did you just say? Invested in what? What! Da Jung's father got information from someone. That the stock would shoot up. The name of that company is L... L Company. What's wrong? It's nothing. What's wrong! [Liar Game] [Episode 5: Layoff Game I] My money! Where is it? I almost ran with it. Take better care. Hello. It's Kang Do Young. Do you have time today? Is there a shoot? It's not that. I have to work later. - I skipped work often due to taping... - Alright. What was that? [I hear you can't come in today. Good luck. Fighting!] Huh? Good luck? Hello. How much time do you need? What do you mean? Where are we going? A photoshoot for a fashion magazine. Excuse me? The cover actress canceled suddenly. The magazine asked the TV station ...if you can model. But you never told me. I'm telling you now. It was urgent. You have to film as well. Why? Should I read your contract here? You're a star that our station invested a lot of money in. From now on, you have to earn your value. Thank you. Good work. You have another appointment. Let's go now. I'll change my clothes. There's no need. They look good on you. What? I told them already. These are you clothes, Da Jung. Thank you. Good job. Where is this? My house. I wanted to invite you to dinner. Why do I need to go to your house for dinner? Is that in the contract, too? Or... am I your slave? It's not that. Then what is it? Oh. Since I have to survive now without Woo Jin, should I kiss up to you and get a hint? I'm sorry but I'll do it on my own. I invited Ha Woo Jin, too. Our program becoming a hit had a lot to do with you two. I just want to thank you personally. Am I out of line? I prepared Chateau Chablis Blanc vintage 1947. Thank you. The bottle looks worn out but it's good. It costs more than $13K a bottle. Of course it's good. In 1947, there was a terrible heatwave in France. Over 15,000 homeless, sick and elderly living alone perished. But due to that heat, the sweetness of grapes rose. And the best wine was born. Why isn't Woo Jin coming? Who knows? Why don't you call him? So, Da Jung's father going broke was because of your revenge? Even if it weren't for you, the stocks would have become worthless. The one who invested everything with borrowed money is in the wrong. It's not your fault. What if Nam Da Jung and me joining Liar Game wasn't a coincidence? If it's a conspiracy, I have my own opinion on that. But how far back will you go? Since that guy Kang Do Young is used to handling huge sums of money, maybe he doesn't feel pleasure with just anything. Or he's a pervert. I can understand that. What is he? A god or something? He asked me... if I think my revenge a year ago was a success. If I join the game and win, I would find out the truth. Nam Da Jung What? What? Where are you? Are you sure you invite him already? Ah. I didn't think he'd accept my invitation. I'm sorry if I seem sneaky. The only one who moves Ha Woo Jin ...is you. Aren't you curious, Da Jung? Why Ha Woo Jin helped you? Who knows? I thought I knew before. But I don't anymore. By chance, have you ever heard about Woo Jin's mother? His mother? She was a respected charity worker and the director of a foundation. She ran several orphanages through the foundation. She helped many struggling people. If you summarize her reputation, there are many striking similarities... ...with you. With me? The ability to feel empathy for another's pain. Not everyone has that. Woo Jin's mother and you... both have that skill. The fact that you'd both go into debt to help another. You're very similar. One year ago, his mother was scammed by a potential investor. She committed suicide. Reading people's hearts is his job. But he didn't know the person closest to him was in pain. Woo Jin's pain must have been great. It wasn't enough to ruin the scammers' company. He even tried to kill the CEO. It's not like I don't understand why. That's why he went to jail. Woo Jin... might see... his mother in you. Seeing you ruined before his eyes would be no different than going through the same pain twice. I didn't mean to burden you. I shouldn't have said anything. No. Somehow... I understand a little bit. How Woo Jin must have felt. You're here. Why are you sitting here? I... Have a seat. What's going on? Were you talking crap about me? Isn't it typical for the missing person to become the subject of conversation? The station is benefiting greatly from you two. Please be understanding that I'm finally getting around to this dinner. We've barely completed round 2 in a survival game worth more than $1 million. The other participants would be furious if they knew about this dinner. I'm planning on meeting the others separately one at at time and making introductions. Let me ask you something. How were the participants chosen? Looking at age, gender, occupation and income, we narrowed it down from thousands of people who possessed the qualities ...we desired. What exactly were those qualities? Well? Being interesting? Like Da Jung. Among the people, there's no connection? If you're talking about Teacher Hyun and Da Jung, we found out in the process. It was a coincidence. If you must find a connection, the fact that everyone needs money. More desperate they are, the more entertaining the show will be. It wasn't enough to ruin the scammers' company. He even tried to kill the CEO. It's not like I don't understand why. Da Jung's father going broke was because of your revenge? If... your father running away in debt is because of someone's doing how would you feel? I would hate them a lot. Is that all? I think I'd want revenge. Because it'd be hard to forgive. [JVN Broadcasting Station] [Reinstatement Game Recording Day] What will happen today? [Goddess Nam Da Jung] He's a gentleman. He's so cool. Wow, are they in line to watch the show? Incredible. Ahjusshi. Ahjusshi, why are you cutting? Ahjusshi! Why are you cutting? Damn it. I went to the restroom real quick. Yeah, right! I've been in line for three hours now! Damn it! Were you the collector during Nam Da Jung and Teacher Hyun's $500K game? Hello! [Milky light Nam Da Jung] What's this? Milky light? Damn it. Have you seen her? Huh? No. I ought to... Give me that. Give me that. Human reality show Liar Game. I'm the show host Kang Do Young. I'll introduce the nine participants in the Reinstatement Game. Milky light Nam Da Jung! Nam Da Jung! Milky light Nam Da Jung! Don't believe it! Why are you tracking the whereabouts of those eliminated in Round 2? Nam Da Jung and I have a connection with L Company. I may look into whether the others have connections, too. Did you find out who couldn't pay back the prize money among the eliminated? Five out of the thirteen returned the prize money without touching it. Another five returned what they spent using bank loans or loan sharks. Three... haven't repaid. You can't reach them. They're missing? Who knows. They might have run with rest of the prize money since they couldn't pay it back. In particular, do you remember participant Lee Myun Jin who made it to the final of Round 2? She agreed to meet me but suddenly disappeared. She had something to tell you. Let's start with her. [Liar Game] Thank you. These nine people have advanced to the Reinstatement Game. What did you bring? It has stronger... ...energy than me. It's possessed by a spirit. Did the spirit tell you which participant to watch out for this time? In Round 2, Jamie's clever mind assessment skills were prominent. We found out you graduated from a prestigious university and had a promising future. I have a powerful destiny. Let's leave it at that. I'll stop there. Yes. Only one will be eliminated from these nine. We'll move to the game field shortly and begin the Reinstatement Game. Don't leave. We ask for your enthusiastic support. Kang Do Young will be at the game field from the start this time. At a shopping mall somewhere. What's the game about? I don't know the specifics. That's right. They told the participants they can bring whatever they want. [Round 3: Reinstatement Game field] Welcome to Liar Game Round 3 Reinstatement Game! As the name implies, the Reinstatement Game is a layoff game. As you know, a layoff occurs in a failing company for the sake of company advancement and survival, employees may be laid off. Let's say you're employees of this huge shopping mall. But due to longterm economic hardship, an order is issued from the top. Evaluate employees based on performance and productivity. One person... ...will be laid off. You will evaluate each other and the person with the lowest score ...will be laid off. A layoff? It might end simply. Right. It's just a popularity contest. I'll explain the evaluation rules. Please watch the screen. Nam Da Jung [Evaluation Choice] Each of you will assign stars for the person you want to survive. [Send] [Sent] Three stars must be assigned each time to someone other than yourself. After a total of ten rounds, the person with the least number of stars will be eliminated. [Elimination] All choices will be made through an app on the game phone. You will have an hour rest period before each round. They call it a rest period. But it's really for strategizing. Besides employee evaluation, you can make deals or contracts using game money. Turn on the app. [$300K] $300K? You have $300K, too? As you see, $300K in prize money has been added in advance. Think of it as a bonus for getting this far. Use it freely as game money in this round. Those who survive the Reinstatement Game will be exchanged for cash. Of course, in order to survive the Reinstatement Game, the game money must be spent wisely. I told you earlier anything can be brought to the game field, right? You can use the game money to buy and sell your items. [Trade] You can make contracts and purchase items in the mall. [Contract] [Purchase] [Trade] [Trade with] [Price] [Contract] [Contract with] [Contract terms] [Send contract] [Do you agree to the contract? Yes or No] [Contract complete] Contracts made in game will be sent to our staff in real time. If terms are violated, all prize money will be confiscated. Keep that in mind. If you utilize these functions well, aside from the $300K in game funds additional prize money may be awarded. Had I known about this, I would've brought valuable items from home. Should I sell my autograph? Director Jung, want to buy my bird for cheap? It's more skilled than me. Do I need to sell something, too? Goodness, that'll just be useless stuff. That place is filled with things worth buying. This might be a trap. Even if we avoid elimination but spend money here, it might affect the next round. Not buying is more important than selling. You think so? You'll be able to sell unthinkable items at a high cost. After one hour of rest, the first evaluation will take place here. Never trust... ...anyone. Damn it. My fingerprints will rub off. Here, Pippi. We gathered so early, you all probably didn't get a chance to eat. It's my treat, so eat up. Eat, noona. The spirit wants you to eat, too. [Nam Da Jung Reinstatement Game, $300K] Is this money really a bonus? What if we spend it all and get eliminated? We'll be down $300K. Prize money is confiscated if we get eliminated. It'll be bad if we lower our guard thinking only one person is eliminated. That's why I thought about this. There's a way for all of us to survive to the end. What? During the Minority Vote Game, we promised to divide the prize money and we survived. Right. Then from now on, let's all promise including Woo Jin. No matter who wins in the end, divide the $10 million equally. What do you think? How is that? How is that? Not bad. Was it your idea? Each person is... guaranteed over $1 million. It's worth a shot. Wow, Da Jung. How did you think of that? That may be true but will it ...be possible? Noona isn't trying to trick us. You don't have to think negatively. It feels right. We can start in the next round. Okay. Let's do it. What I mean is let's start in this game. Huh? Why? Didn't ... everyone decide who to lay off? Huh? We have to admit that the person to be laid off is already decided. The spirit... told me it's her. This is Lee Myun Jin's place? Yes. Due to delay in renovation, it's being sold for cheap. Does anyone live here? This neighborhood is weird. Live in jail if you get a chance. You learn things you can't find in books. There's no sign of a struggle. I guess she just took what she needed. As expected, did she run off in the night? She might've made it appear that way. It seems like she took good care of her dog. Why did she leave it behind? No way. I'm sure she took it. This dog... doesn't it look familiar? A neighbor heard her packing up and leaving urgently ...during the night. When was this? Last Saturday or so. It was around 11pm. Oh... It was around midnight. I saw surveillance cameras installed. Can I take a look? They're all fake. People barely come and go. Why spend money... for that kind of thing? If several men entered the home of a woman living alone late at night and kidnapped her, there's no way you wouldn't know. Since it's very unusual. What? Kidnap? You keep a record of cars going in and out, right? Can I see that? Hey, are you police or something? Should I call the police? I don't know how much they paid you off. You're an accomplice to a serious crime if she was kidnapped. Here, take a look. What do you think is there? From that night until the next morning, no cars ...entered. They probably came earlier and waited. They talked to this guy here during that time. A record of them leaving might be missing. This number 6993. It entered at 2pm that day but no record of it leaving. Thank you. Meet Detective Cha at Gangnam Station saying it's my request. Get vehicle information. Me? I don't get along with him. He owes me. He won't be able to refuse you since it's a missing persons case. [They gave $300K as bonus. Suspicious? Jamie is ostracized. Da Jung suggests sharing prize money.] Let me know where the game is being held. I'll go as soon as I finish here. I know you feel responsible for what happened to Da Jung. But in this round, won't Jamie be eliminated? After what she did. No. Jamie might have the greatest advantage. Hey. Isn't it boring? Time's passing too slow. Should we make speeches to pass the time? Everyone gather and talk about why they should survive. Why would we talk to the person being laid off? Don't talk to us. If I leave as the evil bitch, won't I have trouble adjusting in society? I'm not exactly a good daughter. But my family is watching me. Go easy on me, huh? Like Jamie says, why don't we talk briefly? Don't be fooled by her. Don't you know she's acting? You saw her last time. What's wrong with you all? You all get along now. But you'll have to fight in the next round. Shouldn't you know more about each other? She's driving me crazy. She's got a point. We've been a team until now. But we're enemies again in the next round. What? We agreed to join forces. We talked about the possibility. It doesn't cost anything. Let's take turns speaking. I'm embarrassed to say as a lawyer but... I was scammed. I have to close my office at this point. You all know but... when I was a rising star, I lost it all gambling. My mother is sick. I missed some work to take care of her. And I got fired. I have no way to pay hospital and surgery fees. I found out about this while contemplating death. Oh, my. So, you were really laid off? I was able to get her surgery. Actually, I should be with her now. You spent the prize money on surgery. She's been sick for a long time. It turned out to be a lot of money with hospital and whatnot. It's my turn. Hey. I'm going to be eliminated anyways, so I want to say something. I wasn't always a bitch. The deciding factor was meeting the wrong guy. I came to my senses after I lost all the money I earned by selling drinks and smiles. You can't trust anyone in the world. Sorry to the people I went after. Sorry. I... Oh. But... doesn't everyone know about your situation? Moreover, I'm curious about something. Can I ask? What's with you... ...and Ha Woo Jin? What? You seem to have a special relationship. Is it just me? Woo Jin just helped me. He was your helper, so it made sense initially. And after? In the Minority Vote Game, you and him worked together. Woo Jin says even enemies can use each other for help. Since he said he'd help? Ah. I'm curious about something else. I saw on the show that the creditor actually seemed to help you. What's with him? By chance, is your story about your father a lie? What are you talking about? It's weird. Why else would a creditor help you? What do you want to say? If you guys are going onto the next round with her, know this. Nam Da Jung... ...is really easy. We let you talk because Da Jung took pity on you. What? You're the one who's easy. Fine. I've been around the block. You can tell at a glance. What kind of woman she is. Damn it. What the hell? Isn't this from the photoshoot? Director Jang prepared something childish again. It doesn't matter. The game would've been too obvious otherwise. Now the game... might be fun. What's this? Aren't these... paparazzi pictures only stars are in? What a shot... Where were you two going at night? Yuck! How dirty. Why did you meet... Kang Do Young alone? It's a misunderstanding. What misunderstanding? The evidence is clear. Ha Woo Jin and the creditor weren't enough? Now you've pulled Kang Do Young in? Her acting dumb is just a concept. She's using her innocent face to manipulate men. Ha Woo Jin winning the Minority Vote Game was their scheme. Are they planning to divide the $10 million, too? Or will you split it three ways with Kang Do Young? Wow. I didn't expect this from you, Da Jung. I was nearly fooled. Her acting is no joke, huh? You should've been an actress. Do your own thing. We said what need to say. I'm disappointed. Wanna see? Yes, sunbae. It was unit 402. You never know. So, be careful. Thanks, Detective Cha. What's up with you two? You're not gathering news. What are you chasing? [Unit 402] [Liar Game] Lawyer. Lawyer, hear me out. I'm disappointed. Congressional Assistant, I'll give you my stars... You always go after someone. Handle it. Da Jung, you've become an outcast. Did I overdo it? There's nothing between us. Kang Do Young or Woo Jin. I know. What? You can't lie. I know you can't manipulate men. But I have to survive. What can I do? Everyone is out to get me. The only weapon I had left were those pictures I got somehow. But how could you lie like that? This is Liar Game. Everyone was acting so close. They changed their minds so fast. That's why you can't trust people. Did you come to pity me? I came to survive and save you, too. Actually, there's a way to win this game. It's simple. You and I join forces. In each round, give three stars to the other. If we get thirty stars in the end, we can't be eliminated. The rest only have 30 stars like us. That's true. If someone gets one more star to make 31, someone else will end up with 29. Look at them now. They figure either you or I will be eliminated because of the speech time. They have their guards down. They're probably not even thinking of a strategy. For now, during the first evaluation, I'll give you my 3 stars. Give me the 3 stars you can't use anyway. There's bound to be someone amongst them who only gets one or two stars. Then... since we can keep giving each other three stars, that person will be eliminated. Right. Even if they find out about our plot later, the person already in last place won't be able to make it up. With that, our winning strategy is perfect. Thank you. Whatever. I'm just trying to survive. No need to thank me. Jamie. I'm sorry... for suspecting you. Until the first evaluation comes out, be careful of others' eyes. Those pictures earlier... do you know anything? The camera angles seem forced. I can't deceive you, Producer. I gave Jamie those cards. What? Why? Why are you backing Da Jung into a corner like this? It's fun. Jamie would've survived like a weed anyhow. To let Director Jang play by himself, it's a waste. Yes. Yes. The first evaluation is coming up. After my phone call, I'll go to the field directly. We'll begin the first evaluation. Using your respective apps, please assign stars to other participants. [Nam Da Jung] [Choose evaluation participant] [Jamie] [Send] [Layoff Game] Take a look at the results for the first evaluation. [Layoff Game Round 1 Employee Evaluation Results] How? Jamie. Did you not give me stars? Huh? I gave my stars... to cute Song Joon. You promised me. I did. Why would I keep it though? Like you said, this is Liar Game. What happened with sunbae's case? The stock manipulation was detailed thoroughly. What happened with CEO Kim's murder? Right after Professor Ha ruined the finance company, the CEO got in a car to escape. But guess who was at the wheel? When the CEO woke up after being drugged, he was at the edge of a cliff... sitting bound tightly in a chair. That chair was being held up with a single rope. He must have gone crazy, right? He must have screamed for help. Are you saying... sunbae did something like that? I'm sure he wanted him to feel the same pain and despair his mother felt. [Layoff Game Round 2 Employee Evaluation Results] [Choose evaluation participant] [Goo In Gi] [Layoff Game Round 3 Employee Evaluation Results] [Layoff Game Round 4 Employee Evaluation Results] [Layoff Game Round 5 Employee Evaluation Results] [Layoff Game Round 6 Employee Evaluation Results] Da Jung. Are you okay? Director Jung. I'm sorry... ...this happened. You shouldn't feel sorry. I was tricked like an idiot again. Why does it have to be a layoff game? It must be hard on you. Actually, I can't help you even if I want to. You still don't know, do you? Why so far... you haven't even gotten one point. Well... Da Jung... you agreed to exchange stars with Jamie, right? Yes. She said it was a way to win. Actually, we thought of that strategy, too. The seven of us agreed to give each other stars. Then... either you or Jamie would be eliminated. But then... Are you planning to give stars to each other? Jeez. Get lost. Hey! Leave! You think you'll survive like that? Of course. Either you or I'm sorry to say, but Da Jung will be eliminated. One of you. Each of us will have 30 stars. But Nam Da Jung and I agreed to do that, too. Then what will happen? I ought to... So... what happens then? If just one star doesn't go to the right person... The game is a bust. Can you still trust each other? That oppa over there with the awful look... will probably come to my side if I give him money. You little... She's an expert. Even if it's not Doggie oppa, if I were to give $100K, are you confident no one will fall for it? Do you trust each other that much? Get it? Since you ostracized us, Nam Da Jung and I are partners. So, now one of you is sure to lose. Was this your plan all along? Noona's not finished talking. I came to make you a deal. No. With this, I came to sell something. What? Your victory. I'll rescue you guys. What? Rescue? How? I'll betray Nam Da Jung. The stars I agreed to give Nam Da Jung... I'll give them to you instead. Then Nam Da Jung is sure to lose with zero points. Got it? Buy my betrayal. With this. Who knew she would use her buying and selling power like this? So, each of us... agreed to pay $50K and bought Jamie's betrayal. But she didn't keep her promise to me. We wrote a contract using this. Breaking it means elimination. Anyways, that's why I can't help you. All of us are bound by contract. I told you not to talk to Nam Da Jung. Do you want to be laid off again? Forget it. I already won this game. Trust each other? Speaking bullshit like that in such an earnest and pretty voice. Nam Da Jung is in big trouble. Why aren't you answering? Damn it! In such a precarious situation, are you going to ignore my calls? Something came up. Like what? Did you get my text? This is High Square. Nam Da Jung is... See you there. Hello. Damn it! When you came to, you were hanging over a roof? That... is the same strategy I used. If someone took Lee Myung Jin, they know me. But why... didn't they kill you? They could have. It's a message. Not to step outside the boundaries. [Round 3: Layoff Game field] Shopping is boring, too. Hey, Nam Da Jung. Want to make a bet? I just want to be alone. Can you leave? Hey. It wouldn't be enough if you begged for rescue. You're approaching it wrong with that attitude. What's the point? It's over already. Grab twigs at least. Let's bet. If you win, I'll give you all my stars. Give me all your stars? Is that possible? Of course. The evaluations yet to come are under contract. But the ones I've received are mine. As long as the contract is valid, why not buy or sell? Right? Yes, it's possible. Depending on the contract, the stars can shift in the next evaluation. See? If you win, our situations can switch. What if... ...I lose? Give me half of your game money. The chances of winning are 50/50. How's that? What's the game? Don't be scared. It's totally simple. I brought it in case I got bored. Maybe it was a printing mistake, but there's a card like this in the deck. A card printed with only the back? With this... and this... A really easy game that can be played with just these cards. I'll show you how. Here. Pick one and put it on the table. With only one side showing. Now... if we flip it, it might be the Joker or it might be the same back. The chance is 50% I'll let you choose. Do you like light? Or darkness? Light. Okay. Then if it's the face card, you win. If it's the dark back, I win. Since it can't be face up as soon as you take it out, we'll redo it in that case. We'll keep playing until the person who wins ten rounds first is the winner. Simple, right? Ah... You're worried I'll deceive you. I'll shuffle the cards. You pick. Then it's totally fair. Okay? Fine. Since it's a 50/50 chance. [Contract terms] Okay. Flip it. It's the face card. I win, right? Yeah. One to zero. [Nam Da Jung - 1 Jamie - 0] You're making me nervous from the get-go. Here. There we go. It's 50/50. It's not easy, right? [Nam Da Jung - 2 Jamie - 3] [Nam Da Jung - 4 Jamie - 8] [Nam Da Jung - 6 Jamie - 9] Now... If... it's the back this time, I win the game. Of course, there's a 50% chance it might be the face card. Professor Ha. What's going on? Huge guys are guarding the entrance. They don't move. Or answer any questions. What do I do? We have to get in. [Liar Game] What happened? I hear you're losing. Spectacularly. I shouldn't have kept playing the game. Nobody cared about my way to win. I'll decide whether it's over or not. Do Young, you knew, right? Why didn't you tell me? You never know. A surprising turn of events might begin. I'll reveal the evaluation results. Nam Da Jung is still in last place. Have you given up already? I'll get payback for what I went through. I'm a dog. Nam Da Jung's faithful and vicious dog.
