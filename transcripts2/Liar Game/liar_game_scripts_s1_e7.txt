 The important thing is that the movement of funds within the game are reflected in the participants' funds. However after the game is over, the funds assigned are irrelevant outside of the game. [JVN Broadcasting Station] I'll change the question. What's... your connection with L Company? An analyst and a company that's disappeared from the stock market. You, me, Nam Da Jung and the other participants are connected, right? No? We weren't chosen coincidentally. You're so suspicious, Woo Jin. Trust me. Is it so wrong for a person...

 to trust another person? What? You... know me, don't you? [Liar Game] [Episode 7: The President Game I] Of course I do. You're famous now. It's not a coincidence Nam Da Jung joined the game. Nam Da Jung's father going into debt because I ruined L Company... You knew about it, huh? Nam Da Jung was just bait to pull me in. You were waiting for me from the get-go, right? You'll never find the answer like this. I told you. If you want to know the truth, win the game. The game will get harder because you broke the rules. The enemies will become stronger. Of course, I... like it because it's more fun. Is this fun to you? Now, now... The cameras are rolling. Enjoy it... ...my friend. Now, now, let's go again. PD. Standby. The last question is the one viewers are most curious about. Why are you helping Nam Da Jung to this extent? I need her. Nam Da Jung has power. The power to move people's hearts. That sounds like you're using Nam Da Jung. Can I interpret it that way? Do as you like. If you advance to the final round together, you'll turn your back on her? Of course. I'm going to win. As I hoped. But I'm going to give the prize money to her. Why? I want to see her wish... ...come true. That'll complicate things. The viewers will want to see you fight viciously for the prize money. What if the game gets boring because of Nam Da Jung? You wouldn't let that happen. You'll keep creating situations of betrayal and conspiracy. Overcoming that and seeing if the participants can trust each other and stick together, isn't it fun to sit back and watch? Woo Jin. What? Thank you. I wondered what you wanted to say. I had my own reasons. Woo Jin. I think you're a good person. It's obvious I'd be targeted for restraint. It's to my advantage to push you forward. Awhile back, Teacher Hyun borrowed money from me. - Right? - Here she comes. Hey! - Here she comes! - Here she comes. She's here. Hey, Da Jung! Da Jung! Hey, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Come here. Come here. Long time no see. Say hello. Some look familiar, right? Hello. Hey. We were just talking about you. Wow, did you see it? She can't lie because she's so kind-hearted. You saw the show. Her heart is so tender. She took care of all the eliminated people, right? Well... Goodness. I'll explain. Go inside. Have you heard of the Money Money Company? I've heard of it. My company is no joke either. But we're waiting. Jeez... They all left. I'm sorry. It's my fault. No way. I feel relieved after quitting. But those people are having a hard time. You quit? Huh? I meant that I want to. I'm hungry! Any food? Wait a little. Okay. You're on TV! ...is a big strength to those in need. Wow. Show your love. According to the news, your supporters have increased a lot. Really? I'm proud of you. Proud, got it? Professor Ha. Hey. Now? Wow, Professor Ha... A scamming scheme. Murder... - You're here. - Yeah. You... didn't wash up for me, right? I feel a little weird. Stop with the nonsense and sit. Goodness. Why'd you quit your job? Just because. It didn't suit me. The creditors were gathered in front of Da Jung's house. I got rid of them all. I'm no joke, huh? Standing on the opposite side for once... I wondered why I'd lived like that. They say people die if they change suddenly. Jeez, you always... Why'd you call me? Listen well. I'm only going to say it once. What? Me asking you... to help Da Jung... was already calculated? That's why at first... I suspected you. Me? I'm Jo Dal Goo! People made fun of my name, but... I'm not that kind of person! I know. But... Da Jung's father becoming like that... happened to be... He knew that? Who the heck is Kang Do Young? What's his grudge against you? Don't... tell Nam Da Jung yet. Darn it. I guess so. By chance, how did you get involved with Money Money Company? Ah... Someone introduced me after I was released from jail and bumming around. Who was that? A person I met coming and going. I don't really remember. What was his name? He said he knew the company president. He kept saying the company and job were a good fit for me. What about him? Money Money, Kang Do Young... and L Company's connection... You have to find out. [Day of Liar Game Round 4 Recording] I'll be back. Good luck. The game you'll play in Liar Game Round 4... is the... ...President Game. President Game? As you know, the President determines policy and runs the country on behalf of the citizens. It's a very important role. In the game, you'll have 3 elections. The president elected in each election gets a share of the prize money and has the power to eliminate participants. Also, the final elected president has the power to choose teams for the next round. They can rise to a very advantageous position. Then... how many will be eliminated total? Four people. Oh, my. How will the candidates be chosen? Not all nine of us can become candidates. The candidates... ...are not here. The participants must select a presidential candidate from the outside and bring them to the studio. The time limit... ...is 24 hours. Wait, you want us to go out and find candidates now? Is it okay as long as they're not a participant? What are the qualifications? Qualifications? Well... Tocqueville said this... In a democracy, the people... get the government... ...that they deserve. Did that help? Um... What if there aren't any candidates or only one? The game will become very simple. However... that won't happen. It's a chance to turn the tables. They won't refuse. Right. Especially that sly fox over there. That kind of look excites me so much. Whatever Jamie does, wouldn't it work as long as the eight of us stick together? We'll elect someone who feels like we do. President Bae? That loser didn't even change the lock. Look at this. You can tell I don't work here anymore. Jeez. What's this? Hey, look at this. Jeez. Where's the key? That little bastard. He sure is sneaky. There it is. You bastard President Bae... Hello. That trash Jo Dal Goo's cases... Give them all to Young Dal. Young Dal. Young Dal, you moron! Don't you know him? Mi Dal's brother, Young Dal, you stupid moron! Yeah. Bye. That moron... are his ears plugged? What are you doing? There's a door, you know. You'll hurt yourself that way. I didn't want to disturb your sleep. I'll be going. Jo Dal Goo. Yes? You came in as you pleased, right? But not when you leave. Guys! Yes, sir! Get up, asshole! You're dead, you moron. See you all later. I'm afraid of who that stupid bitch is going to bring in. Ahjusshi, don't worry about it. Let's go talk about it. The Congressional Assistant isn't out yet. Let's wait for him. - He's not coming. - What? Why not? Will he bring another candidate? That's obvious. Who do you think? The election is coming up soon. What are you doing on that trashy show? Are you going into the election empty-handed? Don't you want to do politics? Well... It's regarding the TV show... It'll give you media coverage and be a sensation. Even fundraising. Three things in one shot. If I win three times, the next next... No... the next election is yours. I'll do my best. Excuse me? Move, move, move. Be... Be quiet. Be quiet, asshole. Be quiet. Shut the mouth. You bastard. Close it. Should I take care of it? No. Wait and see. For now. Ta-da. This is on the house. Wow. Business is booming because of Da Jung. The operations manager... Oh, the operations manager? Then should we make him our candidate? Do you know his birthday? I have to read his facial features, too. No, let's not do that. Let's think about it seriously. If we're going to use Da Jung's winning strategy, what candidate would be best. No matter who wins, it has to be someone who'll keep their promise to share the prize money. It's nice to see you... ...unified. We learned it's to our advantage to trust each other. We can't make the same mistake twice. Yes. That's me. Dal Goo ahjusshi? What? What is it? It's the president of Money Money. If I don't settle the debt right away, he said he'll sell ahjusshi's organs to pay for it. Wait. By Dal Goo, do you mean that loan shark? Goodness. His situation is unfortunate. But why would you do that? Call the police. If I report it, they said I'll never see ahjusshi again. What do I do? A doctorate in math from Cambridge and is a pro gambler. He has star quality. Well... He looks smart. So? What do I get out of it? The guarantee of $1 million... and become a celebrity? That's it? 9 to 1... That's too much. Either way, you'll be eliminated in the final round if you don't do something about Ha Woo Jin. If you don't make him your partner, you can't win. Will this guy cut it? I think... my card... will go over better. You jerk. Why does this asshole keep blabbering? Did you give him enough medicine? It's no problem... to do my work. It better not be. You'll die if it is. Goodness. She's saying open him up. Repaying generosity like this. If it wasn't for those guys, I never would have used this guy. Huh? Those... - ...guys? - Yeah. Our number one. He delivers the debtors to me. Like you. You're a parachute. You didn't know? You jerk... Kang Do Young... Are you his lackey? Bastard... - Kang Do Young? - Yeah. - Kang Do Young? - Yeah. Dal Goo doesn't know what he's talking about. That bastard Kang Do Young... What? Speak louder, jerk. I will, jerk. You're dead, you stupid bastard! Open him up. Stop. Who are you? Who is this? It's Ha Woo Jin. Wow, you're handsome in person. Like a model. But... did you come alone? Oh, that's right. Do that thing. That thing. That thing. "I have a way to win." I sound just like him, huh? I should've been an actor. Ahjusshi! Ahjusshi. Ahjusshi, are you okay? Who the heck are you? Who the heck are you? What's that? Get it away! What is this? Starting today, Jo Dal Goo has become a participant in Liar Game. If he gets injured, this footage will be sent to the police as evidence. I'm so scared. I'm so scared! Do I look like a joke? Do you think I'll just stand by and watch? [Detective Cha] Yes, Detective. Ah. We're filming right now. How far are we from Seoul again? Really. I'm going crazy. Ahjusshi. Be our president. Huh? That little thing? Okie dokie. [Next day - Day of President Game Recording at JVN Broadcasting Station] Jeez. Wow. But... I really agreed to do this? I don't remember. Did you find anything out? Yeah. I know I heard something important. I heard it... But... Focus on the game for now. I'll do it if you say so. Goodness. Along with Nam Da Jung, six others have nominated as their candidate... Jo Dal Goo. Congressional Assistant Kim's presidential candidate Kang Shin Gyu. I'm Congressman Kang Shin Gyu. Please take good care of me. Yes, yes. Thank you. Presidential candidate Kang Shin Gyu is here. If there are no other candidates in the remaining five minutes, we'll complete the nomination of candidates here. Should I... ...pick someone? Jamie? That is... difficult based on the time remaining. Why? He's already here. For... presidential candidate... I nominate Kang Do Young. This makes no sense. You'll refuse, right? Of course. I'm the MC of this program. According to the rules, anyone can be a participant. There's no problem. But it's off balance. No. It does balance. For Ha Woo Jin's opposition, what better card do we have? What are you thinking? I'm going crazy. I thought you wouldn't refuse any role for the sake of ratings. The viewers will be in an uproar. Feeding the uproar and making a spectacle is both your specialties. We should at least have a viewer vote. To see what the response is. We don't have time for that. It's impossible for me to enter the game because of Jamie's selection. Maybe if the... other participants agree. Ask then. We'll make it a majority vote. What if he ends up participating? If those involved want it, there's less reason to refuse. Who will be the MC? We'll call up an announcer. Not just anyone can be the MC. They won't be able to understand the game flow. I do have someone who might work. An announcer. What? Kang Do Young? Have you... ...jumped ship? Jeez. You disappoint me. It's a chance to take out the thorn on your side. He gives up his MC position as soon as he enters the game. Even if he wins, he'll be condemned. He won't be able to get involved in the production or gameplay. It's a slam dunk. What about the MC? Who do you think? As expected, he fell for it like you said. Are you accepting... my proposal? Yeah. I think it'd be more fun playing with you than an old man. After discussion, the producers will leave the question of whether I become a participant to you all here. If there are more than five people against it, we'll treat this like it never happened. Now then. Let's hear... everyone's opinion. The presidential voting system is part of the three branches of power that prevent too much power distribution. I don't think it corresponds to this game. I'm against it. You sure make it hard. Who cares if it's fun. Shouldn't the competition be fair? I'm against it, too. More than the second game, the third... I think it'd be better to create a change. I don't really care for Dal Goo. You're too similar to me. It's annoying. In my dream last night, the spirit appeared for the first time in awhile. He said I'd meet an unexpected savior. I think he was talking about this. He wants me to agree. I'm against it. It's over then. There are already four against. Doesn't Woo Jin make five? I was nervous. It's a relief. I'm for it. But I have a condition. I forbid individual interaction with the staff. And all the information you have on the game... Announce it to us. Professor Ha. I'm... Jo Dal Goo. I'm... Jo Dal Goo. I'm disappointed. Damn it. Excuse me. Why did you agree to Kang Do Young joining the game? More frightening than Kang Do Young is an enemy inside. The participants who agreed would have betrayed you eventually. Give them an opportunity to choose. It's better to teach them they were wrong. Alright. I'm sure your judgment is correct. I'll explain to them. But is that true? I gave her the runaround. What? Why did you do it? How could you bring Kang Do Young in? Rather than leave him to manipulate us from above, it's better to wage direct battle in the ring. What if we lose? Do you think I'll lose? No. That's impossible. I know what you're worried about. But I won't let Nam Da Jung get hurt. As expected of Professor Ha. He did it to pick out the enemies inside. I guess that makes sense. But still... Kang Do Young... Nothing will change. Just stick together like we've... I'm going to... wait and see. I trust you, Da Jung. But I don't know about Ha Woo Jin. I'm sorry. Don't trust Ha Woo Jin too much, okay? Let's go. [Round 4 President Game Stadium] Hello... viewers and participants. I'm taking Kang Do Young's place as the new MC of Liar Game. I'm Director Jang Chul Soo. Nice to meet you. From now on, I'll explain the rules of Liar Game Round 4, the President Game. The procedure is as follows. The candidates announce their campaign promises. Afterward, there will be a poll to determine supporters. You will have one hour to campaign. Afterward, voting will take place. When a winner is determined, the promises will be executed and the winner will pick participant for elimination. It's similar to a normal election. There are two important points. The campaign promises and selection for elimination. First, the promises. Out of three promises made, one promise can be false. Before the candidate announces their promises, out of two buttons labeled "true" or "false"... If the "false" button is pushed, that promise doesn't have to be upheld. So, lying is necessary. If the "true" button was pushed, but that promise was broken, it automatically becomes false. If your "false" promise button was used already, that candidate is eliminated. The promise description... can include anything regarding the distribution of game money. And... ...for elimination. The President... can eliminate one non-supporter. But the president who wins the last election can eliminate two participants whether or not they're supporters. Including the candidates. The game money in this game will be deposited. Each is worth $10K. There are two kinds of game money. The money used for the nation will be installed in the local booths. In the national safe, as you can see is a total of $900K. Only the president can deposit it. And in your individual safes in every election $100K will be paid. In other words, like local district planning funds. Any questions? What happens if money is left over after the funds promised are distributed? It will be given to the last winner. Excuse me. About those eliminated... So... you can survive if you pick the right person, right? That's right. Um... How will the campaigns be run? As you know, campaigns require money. That money comes from the supporters' pockets. I'll explain the details... later when we go down. First, we'll hear each candidates' speech. Number one, Kang Shin Gyu! My... heart is warmed to be standing here today. When is your birthday? Jeez. Let's focus. I'm evaluating the candidate. Personal candidate information will be given later. Focus on the speech. I... Kang Shin Gyu... always... It seems like that guy is really here to solicit votes. We'll edit it. Um... I... am Jo Dal Goo. I will... You're a loan shark, huh? Yeah, I... No... I quit awhile ago. What's your relationship with Nam Da Jung? Huh? Relationship? Um... Well... He's someone I trust. Ahjusshi could have stolen my money anytime. But he protected me. If you trust him, he'll never betray you. That's right! When you talk... about loyalty... I can't be beat. Thank you. Everyone... How did I come to here? Of course, it was due to Jamie's nomination. But it's probably due to your fear of Ha Woo Jin as a powerful opponent. Look at Ha Woo Jin who supported my participation with open arms. He's the youngest psychology professor at a university. A genius swindler. That's right. We forgot momentarily. But he's a swindler who ruined a company. This is Liar Game! What's the truth and what is a lie? Does he really have no other motive helping out Nam Da Jung? When Jamie nominated me, I hesitated at first. But what I decided was that a criminal must be stopped from winning Liar Game and ruining the show. I trust... that everyone will make the... ...right choice. Thank you. We'll give each candidate 30 minutes to prepare their promises. Participants who support an individual candidate... Move to your respective candidates' election camp. For those who remain undecided, without a party... Remain here until the promises are announced. Take some free time for yourselves. I don't get it. But Da Jung's side... See? They're not coming over. No. It's because I didn't convince them well enough. We just have to make them trust us again. About the promises... I used my brain for the first time in awhile as a presidential nominee. What if we go with Nam Da Jung's style? What do you think? Not lie at all. What do you think? What? That's a good idea. But what about this? - Use up the lie first. - Huh? I thought you wanted them to trust us. Why lie from the get-go? No. It's not a bad thought. Circles... X... Circles... What's that? There are four possibilities. It's true that we can lie once. It's a double-edged sword. False promises are good for bringing in votes. But the voters will be suspicious even if we make true promises. That's why it's not a good strategy to never lie. Even if we say it's true, the voters won't believe us. Then the most advantageous strategy... is lying at the very end. In the most important last battle, guaranteeing the maximum amount with a false promise. But he doesn't have to keep it. On top of that, we can use the game money as we like. Let's go with this then. But what happens if the other two teams use this strategy? Won't it be pandemonium? That's right. No one can verify that their promise is true. So, instead we choose the safest method. First, we make an obviously false promise and confirm that our first promise was definitely a lie. Then... The voters will see that our second and third promises must be true. They'll be able to trust and vote. Hold on. If we make an obvious false promise, no one will vote for me in the first election. Sacrifice the first election and go with the most promising candidate in the latter half. What if I get eliminated? That's true. There's a foolproof way to avoid elimination. Do I look okay? To lie outright in an atmosphere like this... I really... Don't be nervous. Okay. We'll start with Candidate Kang Shin Gyu. Announce your promise. Do I have to push this? [Truth] If I become President, I will... divide the $900K national funds and give each of you $100K. Everyone... this is my steady political experience and sincere effort to create a nation! Candidate Jo Dal Goo... announce your promise. Um... If... I become President, I will give each of you $900K. Thank you. $900K? Yeah, right. Is that talking or barking? I can't trust you. Candidate Kang Do Young... announce your promise. To... the supporters who trust and follow me, I wish to give the highest compensation. So... if I win, from everyone... I'll collect... $100K in taxes. What? We could collect taxes? So, all the national money... I'll give it to my supporters. With that, we have completed the promise announcements. We'll begin polling now. The three colors signify each candidate's party affiliation. If you push the button, you will be designated by the color of the candidate you support as a party member. Party members can contribute to their respective candidate's campaign. [Jo Dal Goo] [Jo Dal Goo] For those who want to choose a candidate more carefully, push the white button. You will have no party affiliation. [Kang Shin Gyu] The color you select... [Kang Shin Gyu] will remain until the election voting. [Kang Do Young] I don't have money to spend on a campaign. [No party affiliation.] I'll keep watch for now. [No party affiliation.] No party affiliation. [No party affiliation.] Come scout me! I can see the trend. [The President Game] Campaigns will take place during the next hour. White non-party members can talk with anyone if desired. But party members or candidates... can only speak with their respective party. If... a party wants to speak with a different party or non-party member, you must use election funds. Individual campaigning must take place on an individual basis inside the booths. After calculation, an amount of $10K of campaign funds will be transferred from the supporter's safe. A group campaign will require $50K in campaign funds. You should've told me taxes could be collected. I didn't... think that far. I'm sorry. During the rules explanation, they said game money can be used in any way for the promises. So... if we don't vote and Kang Do Young becomes President... The prize money won't increase. We'll go broke instead. Congressman Kang's promise seemed okay in the beginning. But it's no contest now. He's going to give us $100K whether we vote or not, why vote? But what's with that loan shark's promise? The total prize is $900K. How can he give us $900K each? It's an obvious false promise. That means he's planning to win by telling the truth in the remaining elections. Oh... I see. We don't have enough funds. We should go with the candidate most like to win. According to my analysis... Request all of it. Elections are won with money. You reap what you sow. I'm already trailing. If I want to get elected... You'll win! You were born to be king. Not just here, but you'll win in real life as well. Thank you. How funny. She went on and on about birth dates. I guess she read his birth chart. Now, shall we begin to move? Professor Ha. Aren't we going to do anything? To show our promise was indeed false. We just need to prepare for the second promise. Hey, Assistant Kim! A request for a group campaign. - Bring Fortuneteller Pippi quickly. - A group campaign? Hurry! Yes, sir. I don't believe in fortune telling. I'll take the prediction that I'll become President as a compliment. It's not a bad thing... to heed warnings. Kang Do Young... You were born with a good chart... but you're a traitorous white tiger who eats his parents and owner. Voting for him will bring calamity. What about Jo Dal Goo? He's small. No fortune to be a public figure no matter how hard I look. This man was born to become President. If you vote for him, - you'll become popular. - Popular? If you vote for him, you'll get money. If you pick him, you'll get a girl. What the heck is that? Should we request a group campaign? No need. The game is over. Why do you think... Jo Dal Goo made a false promise? [Kang Do Young] [Kang Do Young] [1st Voting Results] Starting now, the first voting results will be announced. In the first vote of the President Game, the results are... With seven votes total, candidate Kang Do Young becomes President. The winner will receive the key to the national safe. Thank you. The role suits you. This was all part of Professor Ha's strategy. You moronic idiot. But... If that's the case, even though he gave a false promise, he didn't have to be eliminated. He used up his false promise with no possibility of elimination. That's right. I'll gather taxes from all voters... As expected of Ha Woo Jin. will be given to the supporters. Final calculations, please. Then how much money do we get? $900K taxes plus $900K in national funds. Wow, that's $1.8 million. If we divide that by seven... Along with campaign funds $1.85 million... So, each person gets around $264K. Over $200K! Yay! We'll start the elimination selection. Up for elimination... Two people who did not vote for candidate Kang Do Young. Congressional Assistant. Fortuneteller Pippi. My psychic abilities are waning lately. I spoke incorrectly. If you save me, I'll help no matter what! There's no point in saving him! Live or die, I'll vote for candidate Kang! The first participant to be eliminated... This sucks. is Fortuneteller Pippi. What the? Huh? Kang Do Young. Why didn't you choose your opponent's assistant? I'm curious why you picked Fortuneteller Pippi. She speaks too lightly. That kind of irrational and unreasonable voter shouldn't have the right to vote. I saw it! You have a traitor's fortune! You'll get butchered by the owner. You have a dog's fortune! After a 30 minute break, the second promise will be announced. We should also verify, right? Whether Kang Do Young's promise was true or false. What the... What is this? Where's my money? Jeez. What happened? I don't think we'll need to. Jamie. Did you know? Well... isn't that the nature of the game? Don't get too mad. All the promises... will be true now. Damn it! It was the same strategy as us. But the people feel betrayed. Won't they vote for us if we have the same strategy? Well... I guess so. It's time for the second election promises. We'll start with Candidate Kang Shin Gyu. From... those who don't vote for me... I'll collect taxes. I'll gather those taxes and distribute them to my supporters He copied Kang Do Young's promise to the tee. Jeez. If I win, I'll distribute... all the money... in the safe to my supporters. It has to be true. It's not bad. I'll share the money in the national safe evenly with the first three people. The first three? Each person gets at least $600K. Why only three? Shouldn't it be at least four? So... Lawyer Go... Goo In Gi... Bulldog... Choi Sung Joon... Those without a party affiliation... the three people who push the button first win. Did Jamie pick a party? Starting now, we'll begin polling. [2nd Polling Results] [No affiliation] What do we do? Kang Do Young's promises are true. With those three and Jamie... Won't he win with four votes? No. Look. Jamie has no party? So, you don't need to care about me anymore? Go ahead. I thought I was dead. But Jamie has no party. Kang Do Young went overboard while trying to win with promises. Overboard? Kang Do Young's promise was to decrease the number of people to share the money. It's the best way to secure votes with the highest amount of money. But he needs to secure a prerequisite. That Jamie can't betray. Due to Kang Do Young going overboard, Jamie has control of the game. Didn't Jamie vote for you? I'm just a bulldog chasing a chicken then. If I included Jamie, it would have been one-fourth. It wouldn't have differed from Jo Dal Goo's promise. I couldn't have secured your votes. Then... you weren't in with Jamie from the start? Tell Jamie. If she betrays me, she'll pay the price. - What are they talking about? - How frustrating. We can't even go in. I'm going crazy. Oh, I'm so scared. I won't win because I'm fixated on Kang Do Young. He's treating me like a piece of trash. So, what will you do? I'm voting for Jo Dal Goo. The three of them with Sung Joon will vote for Jo Dal Goo and my vote makes four. The second election will be won by Jo Dal Goo. Your $600K is just a hopeless dream. You'll be thrown away like me if you trust Kang Do Young. So... How about this? Form a new party with me. With us four, we can make any candidate win. Let's take over... ...this game now. Um... I think we should join forces with Jamie. What? What the... This is crazy... Why did you want to see me? How about joining us in the second round? I told you. I don't trust Ha Woo Jin. But you trust me. Believe in me and watch... Ha Woo Jin whom I fully trust. Let's try our best. Put on a show why don't you? What the heck are they doing? What are you doing? In front of someone else's camp? The four of us are joining forces. Can you see that if the four of us join forces, we'll win no matter what? We only have one condition. We'll make you President. In exchange, the third election will be ours to dictate. We'll decide as we like. You better not say something else when we let you win! You'll be eliminated immediately. We're going to end negotiations in ten minutes. Decide fast. Just because they've seen that somewhere. Jeez. You guys are so realistic. What do we do? It seems like they're already on Congressman Kang's side. Let's face it for now. I'm Jo Dal Goo. Hear our side out. You should've come earlier. We're already finished talking with this side. Hey... I came all the way here. You should hear me out. Are you deaf? The negotiations are over. Get lost. Do you hear a dog barking? I was talking to Jamie but I keep hearing "woof, woof." Don't make a mistake you can't take back. Forget it. I'm not going to accept any proposals. Get lost. You still don't get it after being betrayed by Jamie like that. You stupid idiot. There's no bigger moron than you. You sure talk amusingly. Ahjusshi, can he talk to us like this? No more conversation. You'll receive your first warning. What's wrong? I was talking to myself. I was cooing at the cute dog that was barking. Hey. It's annoying because our characters overlap as it is. You wanna die, you stupid asshole? Hey. Come here. What gang are you from? You Bulldog son of a bitch! Hey! - Hey, asshole! - Hey! Those lowlife jerks. Stop it, you crazy bastards! Come here, asshole! I'm dying! Get lost! Let go, asshole! You stupid little... Jo Dal Goo! Jo Dal Goo! Jerk! Really... I ought to... That jerk Jo Dal Goo. Jo Dal Goo, Bulldog, this is your first warning. You'll be isolated until the voting begins. What do we do? Your plan is ruined. It's not ruined. Do you think Bulldog was pulled out for no reason? That was part of Ha Woo Jin's strategy. He'll be on their side by now. So? You want to retract our agreement? No. The condition for the third election needs adjustment. Let's just say that's the case. There are four of them, too. Even if we join together, it'll be a tie. What will you do? We'll definitely win with four. I'll show you what true politics is. It's no joke, huh? Do you like me? We'll begin the second vote. Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up and hold on! What do you think about my winning method? Is this why you needed four people? To surround the voting booth? We just have to hold out until the voting time is over. Amazing. Are you joking? Move, I have to vote. Look here. After the vote is over, my supporters are just standing in a circle to get closer. But... if you use force to break them apart, it's use of force. Two warnings equals elimination. It's like Kang Shin Gyu says. You've cleverly manipulated the rule's loophole. Hear that? Good work using your heads to pull Bulldog out. But the game is over. What do you mean? Are you saying I changed my mind? Don't act like you don't know. You must've made an agreement outside. It's obvious. No, I really didn't! How dare you yell at a Congressman, you thug! Really. Can you speak so rudely? There's another vote left. What next vote? If I win, I'm going to eliminate you first. Hear that? What should I do about him? If that happens, I'll have four supporters. Three remain. That's how the next election will go. Ha Woo Jin. If you want to survive, you should be good to me. That's only if... your pathetic strategy worked. What? Aren't you all going to vote? How? Don't bluff. Even you can't have a way out. Hold on tight! I can... open that door. [Liar Game] Will you be satisfied with a supporting role? Or do you want to play the lead? We did it, right? I'll share the contents of the national safe with everyone. Do Young and Jamie will be eliminated. We'll have to see what he's up to. How dare you betray me when we gave you a chance? - Elimination? - I'll have to use a sure method. I request a total group campaign. I'll give you a chance then. Only... ...if you win.
