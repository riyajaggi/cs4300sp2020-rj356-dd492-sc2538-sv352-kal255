Three stars must be assigned each time to someone other than yourself.

 After a total of ten rounds, the person with the least number of stars will be eliminated. All choices will be made through an app on the game phone. You will have an hour rest period before each round. Besides employee evaluation, you can make deals or contracts using game money on the phone. Turn on the app. [$300K] $300K? As you see, $300K in prize money has been added in advance. Of course, in order to survive the Reinstatement Game, the game money must be spent wisely. I told you earlier anything can be brought to the game field, right? You can use the game money to buy and sell your items. You can make contracts and purchase items in the mall.

 Contracts made in game will be sent to our staff in real time. If terms are violated, all prize money will be confiscated. Keep that in mind. Nam Da Jung... ...is really easy. Da Jung, you've become an outcast. [Layoff Game Round 5 Employee Evaluation Results] [Layoff Game Round 6 Employee Evaluation Results] Hey, Nam Da Jung. Want to make a bet? If you win, I'll give you all my stars. Yes! Nam Da Jung... [Official notice: Nam Da Jung sending $150K in game money to Jamie.] I thought you were just dumb but you're unlucky as well. Professor Ha. What's going on? Huge guys are guarding the entrance. They don't move... ...or answer any questions. What do we do? We have to get in. [Liar Game] [Episode 6: Layoff Game II] Stop! Stop! Hey, a car! What are you doing? What? Can't I open shop today? Ahjusshi, stop your car. My driving is bad. I got my license but I never use it! Am I supposed to do this? [No entry. Staff only] Goodness, it's cute. Is this a parrot? Is this a parrot? - Can it talk? - Hey, now. - Hey. - Hey, now. Ugh. What now? What is this? What happened? I'll look into it. Team 2. Gather at basecamp. The maintenance team will be here soon. Make sure the participants aren't alarmed. Check on the equipment. Yes, ma'am. What's going on? Hurry up and prepare. They want to inspect your equipment due to the power outage. I didn't hear anything. Everyone's busy right now. I'll handle Da Jung. Alright. What are you doing? Have you given up already? What more can I do at this point? Get payback for what you got. - Woo Jin. - Shh... Don't look at me. Just act naturally. The game was momentarily paused due to a power outage. It's back to normal now. Participants, please continue with the game. For now, go to a place with no cameras. I'll follow. There are none here. How did you get here? I heard you're losing. Spectacularly. People will laugh at me when the show is broadcast. Like you said, nobody cared about my way to win. I just got betrayed. Jamie tricked me again. I shouldn't have kept playing the game. Why would the station put me on the show? Is it fun seeing me suffer? It is. Did you come to make fun of me? Too bad. The game's over already. I'll decide whether it's over or not. What happened? Let go of me! I got it already! I'll leave! I'll leave. I'll go, alright? I'll go. Let go. Let go. Wow, you're like a rock. You don't even move. If you keep doing this, - I'll have to call the police. - The police... Okay. Okay! I won't go in! I'll stay right here. So, one card had only back sides. But you played with two normal cards? You really think you lost due to bad luck? It's a game where the probability is 50/50. No. The game was rigged so Jamie would win from the start. But I'm the one who pulled the cards out. How? Your card was the normal face card, right? How did you know? Why did you pick that card? I'll let you choose. Do you like light? Or darkness? I just... thought light would be better than darkness. You got caught right there. Light and darkness. How many would pick darkness? Especially in a hopeless situation where you've been betrayed and are about to lose. Jamie knew you'd pick light. But it doesn't matter which card. Either card would give a 50% chance, right? What happens if the card you pulled is face-up? It would be returned and shuffled since you can't know which one from the start. Too bad. You could have won if it had been face down. Yeah. What about Jamie? Did she have to shuffle if the card came out wrong? There's no way it would. Jamie's card is the same on both sides. That was the trap. Get it now? There was no chance you'd win from the start. When you pulled a card out, you had a 50% chance of winning. Jamie also had a 50% chance. But in the case you pulled it out face-up, you alone had a 50% chance. Jamie had 0% chance. Then... My chances of winning... were cut in half. So, you and Jamie didn't each have a 50/50 chance of winning. It was 25% to 50%. A pretty big difference, but you think you might still win with luck, right? But the chances of you winning 10 rounds... ...is less than 10%. Oh, my... I didn't know. You couldn't win that game. I'm really an idiot, huh? I can't even take care of myself but asked everyone to join in. That's not exactly how it is. What you said last time wasn't wrong. The method was wrong. In order to gain longterm faith, you can't just trust the other blindly. Suspect in order to trust? No. You have to teach them... what the result of betrayal is. Jamie. Ugh. I lost because of you. What do you want? Wanna play? Play another game with me. Why? This is no fun. So... if I win, I'm fine with half your stars. But if I lose, I'll give you all my remaining money. Half of my stars would be 12. What will you do with that? I didn't think you'd play with me otherwise. If you lose again, you'll be broke. You know that? But it's a 50/50 chance. I might be able to win this time. I guess so. Okay, let's do it. Because I feel sorry for you. But we're keeping the same rules as earlier. Face card, you win. Back side, I win. Okay. The chances are 50/50 after all. Okay. It's 50/50. Nam Da Jung didn't learn her lesson and is playing again. Maybe she can't decipher being backed into a corner. When the lights came back on, didn't something change? Who knows? A shocking turn of events... ...may begin. Just play like before in the beginning. Jamie will take the lead naturally. It's a 50% chance. Why doesn't my card get picked? It's strange. It's not strange. You... just have bad luck. When her guard is down, the game will progress more quickly. She wouldn't want you to catch on to her trick. When Jamie's victory is at hand, we play the trick this time. [Nam Da Jung 5 Jamie 9] How? On Jamie's card, make a mark. Won't I get caught? Just make the mark where it won't be seen. Not the card's front or back... ...but on the side. It won't show but you'll be able to feel it. Make the mark halfway through. When Jamie has her guard down, use your trick. She'll start to suspect later. But it'll be too late. While you win the last rounds, the card with the mark will never be picked. So, that's why you told me to make a mark? And you say one thing before you win. [Nam Da Jung 9] We're evening the score because the odds are 50/50, right? Jamie won't be able to do anything. In the end, you'll win. I won! I won! What now? Ugh. What are you doing, asshole! You little jerk, what do you think you're doing? You stupid idiot, what the hell are you doing? Are you finished? But President... why are you insulting me when you're younger? You rude bastard. I'm not your employee anymore. You stupid idiot... Are you crazy? Who said you can quit, asshole? Starting today, jerk. If I tell you I'm quitting in person, you'll hit me again. I didn't say this until now, but you bastard... don't play games on the office computer, asshole! All the keyboards got ruined. That Q, W, E, R thing. The keys are ruined and I can't use it, jerk! I'm going crazy. Are you... ...talking shit? Says who? Are you finished talking? Nope. The flat tire on your import car... I did it, asshole! You asshole! Where are you? Where are you, asshole? You're dead! I'm hanging up, asshole! You young punk. Damn it. I'll reveal the results of the seventh round. [Layoff Game Round 7 Employee Evaluation Results] [Jamie] [Nam Da Jung] Hey. What happened? Huh? Stars can be transferred? I told you anything can be bought or sold. Jamie. What are you up to? What? I lost a bet. Nam Da Jung, your chances of winning are still zero. At this stage, that's true. I have to go to the restroom. Even so... Woo Jin. I can tell you won. It felt good but I think I aged ten years. It's not easy fooling someone. You still have more lies to tell. It's necessary for my way to win where everyone survives, right? If you must. But I can't win with Jamie's 12 stars. No. Because you took 12 of her stars, the road to win has opened up. What are the other participants doing? They're scattered since this round is over. Listen well. I have a way to win. [Layoff Game Round 8 Employee Evaluation Results] [Jamie 15] [Nam Da Jung 12] The results of the 8th evaluation. The person in last place is still... ...Nam Da Jung. Da Jung. You'll be laid off at this rate. Before you get laid off, shouldn't you do something? Um... Why does one person have to be laid off? Why are you making others choose? Da Jung. This is... ...a game. You created this game, Kang Do Young. Must we follow your rules? You chose this when you joined the game. Whether you win or lose, it's up to you. The ninth evaluation will take place in an hour. There's still time left. So, do your best. I'm going to the restroom again. How is it? The feeling of waiting helplessly for elimination? It'd be great if Ha Woo Jin appeared right now, huh? But he'd only be able to console you. Noona. Sorry. The weather's nice. Don't worry about me and go work. Aren't you leaving? They want me to watch you just in case. Mr. Basketball Player. Here. Have a seat. Huh? Why? What is it? You never know. I might leave if you tell me. Then give up and leave. Nam Da Jung is still in last place after the ...8th evaluation. Last place? I'm going crazy. Why! You scared me. Bong Geun... Hey. - That's Congressional Assistant. - Congressional Assistant. I have to tell you something. Sorry. But I don't think I can help. I know. Because of Jamie, right? Da Jung. Like you said, this show... ...is weird. But what can we do about the system? Change it? That can only be done after you win and people are focusing on you. "This is wrong." Well... I won't forget your sacrifice if I survive. I'll try and change things, okay? I'll give you my remaining $150K. Huh? So, I beg you. Listen to me. Since your situation is so sad, I can hear you out. Wh... What is it? I thought a lot about accepting defeat. But I can't forgive Jamie. Yeah. She's a scary woman, alright. On top of that, she stole $150K from me. She'll probably have the advantage in the next round, too. She took it? $150K? Yes. She tricked me. [$150K] See? Oh, my. It's true. If Jamie gets eliminated, we'll have leftover money. She's probably fearless right now. That conniving woman even has full control over the money? That's why I'm asking you. Take my $150K and give me nine stars. What? Give you stars? Yes. I got some stars from Jamie earlier by winning a bet. I want more stars but then I'd have more than you. [Round 8 Results - Congressional Assistant 27 Nam Da Jung 12] In the next evaluation, I'll have 30 if I receive 3 more. [Round 9 Results - Congressional Assistant 21 Nam Da Jung 21] If I take 9 away from 30, it'll be 21. If you add 9 to your 12 stars... Right. But... what will you do with nine? I'll get six more stars in the ...upcoming evaluations. But that's all for you. Hold on. Jamie has 15 stars right now. [Round 9 Results Jamie 18 Nam Da Jung 21] After the 10th evaluation, it'll be 21. [Round 10 Results Jamie 21 Nam Da Jung 21] She'll be tied with you. Right. That's why I'm asking for nine stars. If we're tied, I'm hoping for a tiebreaker round. You're going to fight to the end? By chance, even if I get eliminated, I hope you beat Jamie in the next round. So, I'm giving you all my remaining money. Okay. That's true. I need some room to take Jamie on. Will you... accept my request? Okay. It's a good deal. We'll begin the 9th evaluation. [Evaluation Choice Jamie] [Send] Well... I'm worried the game has become too simple. In this evaluation, I hope... something fun happens. What do you think, Da Jung? Fun? I don't know about that. But for some reason, I'm looking forward to it. Now... let's view the results of the 9th evaluation. [Layoff Game Round 9 Evaluation Scores] First place... ...Nam Da Jung! [Liar Game] Nam Da Jung has 75 stars! [Layoff Game Round 9 Evaluation Scores] She has a huge lead! What happened? What the... What's this? Da Jung. What's going on? Huh? Um... I gathered them. Each of you... gave me nine stars. Hey. You sold your stars for $150K? Oh, my. You, too? You, too? - Everyone? - We were completely fooled. Noona, you said you were only asking me. Oh, I call upon the spirits... Nam Da Jung came up with that? Nam Da Jung turned the tables in one shot! Let's take a look at the rest of the results. [Layoff Game Round 9 Evaluation Scores] I only have 21? So we're all tied? I gave you... three stars on purpose, Jamie. On purpose? Why? Why do you think? No way. You idiots! How can you give up stars so easily! She was going to give us the rest of her money. There was no reason to suspect. Show me the contract. I, Congressional Assistant, agree to give Nam Da Jung nine stars in exchange for $150K. Once the stars have been transferred, before the next evaluation, you will be paid. Nam Da Jung. You can't pay them all. Your prize money will be confiscated if you violate your contract. Kang Do Young! Am I wrong? Jamie. Yes. If she doesn't pay the money before the 10th round, due to breach of contract, all of her prize money will be ...confiscated. This is a classic contract fraud. She was fooled by her own trick. Why did you do it, noona? Acting all sweet and kind... her true face is revealed when faced with elimination. Why make a contract you can't uphold! She can uphold it. Does Nam Da Jung look like a liar? I told her to. He can't be here. Why is a non-participant in here? Isn't it against the rules? You can bring anything into the game. I'm only this participant... Nam Da Jung's personal belonging. What? Wow. Piece of work. Amazing. Give me a break, you're not an item! How much do you cost? Does it have to be an item? - What about that? - Hey. Don't call the spirit an item! I'm a dog. Nam Da Jung's faithful and vicious dog. I'll show you what happens if you mess with my owner. Hey. Why is he here? How are you managing security? I've been here... Call the PD. No, no. I'll do it. Do Young. Handle it. Do Young. Since she didn't exactly break the rules, we have no choice if the producers allow it. No way. This can't be. The viewers will be in an uproar. You shouldn't be the one to talk. She has an arrogant charm to her, that sly fox. Whatever, no way. Hey, host! Are you going to let this happen? This isn't the time to argue. Take a look at your scores. You're all tied for last place. Who will... be eliminated this time? Like Ha Woo Jin said, the situation is reversed. There's one round left. How will you entertain us this time ...Ha Woo Jin? Listen up. You're all in last place. But Nam Da Jung has an excess of stars. One round left. The number of stars equals... ...power. To repeat, whether you live or die, is up to Nam Da Jung. Let's begin an auction. If you want to avoid elimination, buy Nam Da Jung's stars. Who wants to live? Cut! We'll stop filming momentarily. Do Young. Let's talk. [Director Jang] What will you do about this? You knew, right, Do Young? Why didn't you tell me? It's fun. Like Director Jang says, doesn't it just have to be entertaining? Finally, the game pieces have realized their roles in the game. They're moving on their own now. We shouldn't get involved, but just capture ...the moment well. How do I explain to the Director? It can make sense or not based on how you interpret the rules. You decide, Producer. The partner I chose... for this show isn't Director Jang... ...it's you. [Director Jang] Buy stars? It's like Ha Woo Jin said. We're tied by contract. Every star is precious since we're tied for last place. Damn it. We don't know who will be eliminated. Isn't it best to exchange them for money? Hold on. Am I worried for no reason? Should we all refuse to buy? But then what if someone buys just one star? It'll become mayhem starting then. I think some of the prize money was spent. We have to win enough money to stay alive even if we forfeit. I can't be eliminated now. Who can afford to be eliminated now? I'll just forget it if I can't pay them back. I just won't pay it back. What can they do? Does this look like child's play? It's just a TV show. I've never paid money back in my life. I'm Bulldog. Once I bite, I don't let go even if I'm stabbed. That goes without saying when it's money. Will you be able to? The 13 eliminated in the Minority Vote Game, do you know what happened to them? Only five people repaid the prize money. Another five paid it back with bank loans or loan sharks. The remaining three... ...can't be reached. How dare you make threats? Remember the last woman eliminated in the Minority Vote Game? Lee Myun Jin? I went to her house. But she disappeared. She ran away? She left her precious dog behind. What is that? It's scary. No wonder... What? Actually, I met her after the Minority Vote Game was over. She came to my office. What did she say? Her situation was desperate. She spent more than half of her prize money. Even though she was afraid of legal repercussions, she was wondering if she should sue first. So? Giving the prize money in advance was part of the game for entertainment value. But it wasn't her money yet. I told her she would lose in court. And after that? She cut off contact. Her phone was off, too. Alright. After discussing with our producers, Ha Woo Jin will be allowed as Nam Da Jung's belonging. The game will continue. Does that make sense? Now you get it? Your lives... are hinged on the stars. Will this work? I think they're here. Da Jung. What I said earlier... I thought about it. But I guess I underestimated you. Getting such a good partner is a skill, too. That's right. You two are like the guys from The Three Kingdoms. What about letting me join you? We can work together for big money. - Next. - How much is one star? Wait, I was here first. I'm not being eliminated here. How much? $10K per star. I'll buy five, okay? You're in politics but you have bad sense. $50K each and no more than three. - What? - But... isn't that too expensive? Think about it. Nam Da Jung offered you $150K in the contract. Isn't three for $150K a bargain? - Is that how it works? - Let's call it even? You have to buy at least one not to be in last place. Forget it if you don't like it. Fine, I'll buy. I'll buy. I'll buy! Okay, okay. [Exchange Choice Nam Da Jung $150K] It's a consequence of your actions. The first offer you made to trust each other and divide the prize money was the safest method. But they didn't want to share the prize money hoping someone else will get eliminated. As long as it's not me... that selfishness caused misfortune. That's true, but... if we do it this way, how can I regain their trust? Trust isn't accumulated by blindly believing in someone. If you trusted but got betrayed, you have to make them pay. Compensate trust. Punish betrayal. That's what you do. It's the longterm method to realizing your way to win. - Sell it. - Each costs $65K. What? When? Then for a special price... - Each costs $70K. - What? - How can you do that! - Sorry. It just rose to $80K. Damn it. You son of a bitch swindler. Do you have to sell so high? Ending it like this is fine, too. Fine! I'll buy! Let's do it. You already bought earlier. That... Are you in danger because everyone else bought them, too? Isn't this too much? Why are you doing this? What about you? Why did you do that to Nam Da Jung? But the Director talked to me. That doesn't make a difference to me. I'm a dog not human. Buy or don't buy. Each $80K. $80K is too much. Da Jung. Can you do something? Woo Jin. Please. I don't have much money left. Give me a discount. Then give me the rest of your money. I'll give you as many stars as I want. Damn it. This is despicable. Sung Joon. $40K each. It's half the cost of Woo Jin's. - Really? - Of course. We have to buy now. [Contract Choice $40K] You're getting a bargain. Assistant! Did you hear? It's a jackpot sale. What jackpot? I'm not buying. Why not? Want a bigger discount? Okay. I'll give you a discount. Money's not the issue. Why would I buy that, huh? Since you just sold one, - you're in last place. - Huh? Hey. Hey! My mood swings are severe due to depression. Being a celebrity is hard. The numbers are calculated. Your choice is the only thing left. Will you really do it? Yes. The final 10th evaluation will be held in the studio. After the 9th evaluation, everyone rushed in and bought Nam Da Jung's stars. Depending who and how many stars were bought, the evaluation results will change. Only Nam Da Jung and Ha Woo Jin know the result. Who will become the final laid off participant ...in the Liar Game? It can't be me. Oh, that hurt! How many stars do you have? I told you I don't know! Did you decide who will be eliminated? It depends on who Nam Da Jung gives her final three stars to. We'll start the 10th and final evaluation round. Noona. Da Jung. We should go together. Save me! If you save me, your descendants will avoid calamity. If I get eliminated, I won't be able to act again. I'm Bulldog. I'm sorry. But I've already decided. [Layoff Game 10th Evaluation Complete] All evaluations have been completed. Now let's see the final results. First place... [Layoff Game Final Scores] Nam Da Jung... ...with 31 stars! Less than 29 stars will mean elimination. Tie for second place... all seven people leftover are tied with 30 points. Choi Sung Joon! Lawyer Go! Goo In Gi! Congressional Assistant Kim! Fortuneteller Pippi! Bulldog! Finally... I'm being eliminated in the end. [Liar Game] Jamie. So, the participant to be laid off with only 29 points in the lowest place has been determined... ...as Director Jang. Why? Why me? Why me again! Do... you look down on me? At home... I'm a bad son who couldn't even take care of my ill mother. I didn't have money for medical assistance. They fired me for missing work a few times! Since I gave everything to work, I skipped dinners... lost sleep... I lived for the company! I'm nothing to you guys! Are you throwing me away like trash! Director Jang. When everyone avoided me, you were the only one who talked to me. Thank you. Then why? Why did you eliminate me? Why! So, I could help you. What? On medical expenses, you spent much of the prize money, right? With the money I earned in this round, I'll make up for that. What you need right now... isn't prize money. Don't worry about repaying your debt. Return to your family. What? She's the Buddha. [Nam Da Jung, winner of the Layoff Game] Nam Da Jung took possession of nearly all the stars and game money distributed totaling $2.7 million. The amount Director Jang must repay due to elimination including the amount he already spent and the $300K he lost in this round totals $700K. She offered it. She received an additional $2 million. Even if she forfeits, she'll have a large sum left over. How will you spend it? If I keep all of it, everyone... will have spent $300K? Yes. It's not really my money. It's not everything. But I want... everyone to get $250K each. Does that... mean you'll... participate in the next round? Yes. I've thought about it while playing Liar Game. Was this show made to trick and be tricked? It's possible. But if you think of it another way I think it might be a test to see if we can really trust each other. I trust you all. No. I want to trust. So, I'm going to divide the money. So... I didn't give money to Director Jang alone. All of us... pitched in a little. Yes. You can see it that way. Director Jang. How do you feel after being eliminated? Director Jang? My name... ...is Jang Young Soo. The company gave me... the title of Director, which became... like a second name. I think... it's time to give up the title. We're all... ...in the same boat. Suspecting each other... and tricking a kind person like Da Jung was difficult and torturous. But... in order to survive alone, I didn't even extend a hand. I'm sorry... ...to Da Jung. And I'm grateful. I'm happy I can take care of my mother without worries. Personally... I'm... curious about something. Da Jung. What kind of future do you dream of? Future? Well? Not sure yet... Not too far ahead. Just five years... or ten years ahead? Charity worker or running a non-profit organization suits you. What do you think, Woo Jin? Liar Game Round 3... Layoff Game... [Layoff Game] ...is over. [JVN Broadcasting Station] Do Young. Is there something else I need to know in advance? What? No matter what people said, I believed your intentions were pure in creating this show. Uncovering people's hypocrisy that comes out naturally when faced with huge sums of money. Let's show a drama of human betrayal and greed as it is. But... I'm becoming suspicious. Is that... ...really everything? If not? Why do I feel like... you're obsessed with Ha Woo Jin and Nam Da Jung? So, you think I had a personal reason for creating the game? It seems... the Liar Game has started between us as well. Don't change the subject. Look at me when you're talking. I'll tell you. Were my intentions for creating this show pure? No. Pure doesn't cover it. It's more noble. Next to that, my personal ambition is too small and pathetic. Comparable to dust. Do you need... ...further explanation? Hey! You scared me. Are you slacking off because you're a celebrity now? Are you searching for news on yourself? No, I'm looking for something. Charity foundation director commits suicide. Why are you looking at that? Is it someone you know? Just because. It'll be exactly one year tomorrow. What? Since that woman died. The date is right there. That's true. COMMERCIAL BREAK Let's go together. Where? You're going to see your mother, right? I happened to come across a news article. Did you do a background check? No. I'm sorry if I offended you. I brought food. Your mother seemed like a really good person. How do you remember her? Let's go eat this. Is there anywhere we can go? Follow me. Where are we? The orphanage. Ah... The one your mother ran? It feels familiar here. That can't be. It's because you're easily swayed by others. Is that why? Did you come here often when you were young? With your mother? I'm asking too many questions, huh? My mom died when I was really little. I don't have many memories, so I was curious. Sorry. If so much as a bathroom tile broke, my mother came to fix it herself. I tagged along and played with the kids here. When she was really busy, we stayed for days sometimes. You weren't an orphan. But you lived in an orphanage. She always stressed whenever we came that all the kids were her children like me. Everyone called her "Mom." You must have been a little sad. Probably. Actually, I don't really remember the time I spent here. I guess I don't want to remember. I hated her then. I couldn't accept that I felt that way. How do you remember her as a mother? She trusted people easily. She was fooled easily. She got involved in others' affairs like they were her own. I got angry when I saw her. And worried if I didn't. She was that kind of person. Is that why you studied psychology? You wanted to protect your mother? You can't protect someone with that. You just understand them a little. I failed in that as well though. I don't understand you either. The money you won in the last game... you would have been left with close to $1.5 million left after you forfeited. I could have survived alone. But I didn't want to do that to other people. I'm stupid, huh? What you said when we first met, do you remember? I'm sorry, Woo Jin. Why are you sorry, Mom? It's all my fault. I didn't know you were having such a hard time. Back then... I still don't understand it. Is it so wrong for... a person to trust another person? My mom left me those last words. Is it so wrong... for a person to trust another person? I heard those words again right after I got out of jail. From a complete stranger like you. You're a burden to me. A really heavy burden. I'm sorry. No reason to be sorry. I'm going to throw you away if you don't win. [Day of Ha Woo Jin's personal interview at JVN Broadcasting Company] We're speaking with the main figure of the personal item controversy, Ha Woo Jin. He had the full support of the viewers along with Nam Da Jung. This time the viewers' opposition of you is great. I want to ask those people... when the rule that anything could be brought into the game, an opportunity for outsiders to join appeared. That opportunity... whether it was planned from the start... Why don't they suspect it? The responsibility for controversy lies with the station? I can't avoid the next question the viewers are most curious about. Why are you helping Nam Da Jung to this extent? Um... Can we take a break? Cut. Five minute break. We'll start from Do Young's question. Okay. How do you turn this off? Like this. By chance, do you know about L Company? I do. It was in the news last year for stock manipulation. How could I not know? Me, Nam Da Jung and the missing Lee Myun Jin... and the other participants... Are they connected to that company? What do you mean? When did they get so close? Turn on the audio. The mics are off. Really? Producer. I have to tell you something. I got a phone call. Is it a threat or a source? Can't you tell? It's strange. I think you should talk to them. It better be worth it. Sounds like a payphone. Producer Lee Yoon Joo speaking. You're the producer? I think I just said that. If you don't stop the show immediately, I won't let it go. If this show is allowed to continue, the station... I'm sorry. But I get over ten calls a day like this. Listen more. Especially my Da Jung... leave her alone. A person shouldn't earn money from tormenting a kind girl like her. My Da Jung... If you're done talking, I'm hanging up now. By chance, are you Nam Da Jung's father? I'll change the question. What's... your connection with L Company? An analyst and a company that's disappeared from the stock market. You, me, Nam Da Jung and the other participants are connected, right? No? We weren't chosen coincidentally. You're so suspicious, Woo Jin. Trust me. Is it so wrong for a person... to trust another person? What? You... know me, don't you? [Liar Game] The game will get harder. The enemies stronger. If you want to know the truth, win the game. What do you want? I have to find out... how Kang Do Young and L Company are connected. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Da Jung, you stick to Professor Ha, okay? Liar Game Round 4 is the President Game. You have to bring presidential candidates from the outside to the studio. I nominate Kang Do Young. I agree.
