 Liar Game Welcome to Liar Game Round 2! Introducing Liar Game Round 2: Minority Vote Game The game that I'm about to introduce is called Minority Vote Game. First, a participant is chosen randomly. The participant poses a question or statement that can be answered with a "yes" or "no." Question: If you find a bag of money on the street, you should find the owner. In the game, each player will receive two cards with their name printed. At the time of voting, one card with either "yes" or "no" must be inserted into the voting box. Once the votes are tallied, the side with less votes the voters on the minority side win, while the majority...

 Elimination ...are eliminated. In the case of a tie, a re-vote will be held. Re-vote The person who survives until the end is the winner. Winner If two people are left at the end, they divide the prize money in half. Indeed, who will survive until the end to win $2 million? There's a way to win this game. Form a team of eight people. Kim Bong Geun - male, age 30. Congressional assistant. Strengths: people skills. Lawyer Go - male, age 50. Lawyer. Strengths: Logical and analytical.

 Pippi Spiritual Guide - female, age 45. Fortuneteller. Strengths: confusing and tricking people. Goo In Gi - male, age 40. Actor and former gambler. Strengths: Talker and siding with the winning team. Director Jung - male, age 47. Unemployed. Strengths: Cautious and patient. Oh Jung Ah - female, age 27. Student. Strengths: Good personality, slightly crazy. Look. Divide the eight of us... Half votes yes and the other half votes no. What will happen then? No matter which side wins, four of us will remain. Then... of those... if half are divided again, two remain. One of those two... ...will definitely survive. That person... ...has survived. I guess it's him. Betrayer X. More than that, something's wrong. What? There are other teams besides ours. If Betrayer X is behind this, our way to win is already ruined. What? The next questioner will be selected. Choi Sung Joon I'm the notorious... ...Betrayer X. Liar Game Episode 4: Minority Game II JVN Broadcasting Station Another interesting question. Betrayer X. The subject of the rumors going around among the participants. Is Betrayer X really among us? Like Choi Sung Joon said, is he... ...really Betrayer X? You have one hour! Let the countdown begin! Question: I'm the notorious Betrayer X. You prepared too well. What preparations? He's an agile guy. It's not over yet. Wait and see. Did you tell the participant about the rules of the game already? No way. Moreover, how did the edited out pictures of participants leak? Do you have any suspicions? Who knows? If it's Ha Woo Jin, he can find Betrayer X, right? Who knows? At this point in the game, even if he finds out, there's no guarantee he'll be able to stop him. How exciting. Isn't the show in the Director's hands now? If he can't surpass that much deception, I was wrong about him. You were wrong about him? Nam Da Jung was the one who brought Ha Woo Jin in. That may be so... but when Ha Woo Jin joined the game, didn't we all realize it? He's a man... born for this show. Ha Woo Jin and Nam Da Jung are going toward the Security Room together. What are you talking about? What Betrayer X does has nothing to do with us. Follow quietly. Why are you watching our team? What do you mean our way to win is ruined? Look. Let's say someone among the 22 participants did exactly what we did and make up a team of eight people. But that guy is one step ahead. Instead... he formed... three teams rather than just one. Then... he'll survive no matter which team wins. Right. But that's not all. That guy will win for sure. Huh? How? What was the result of the first vote? 10 to 12. Do you still not get it? Then... What will the result of the next vote be? If... half divide and vote again... Oh, my goodness... the side with the black wins. Right. There must be 24 people to make up three teams of eight. But since the black stone is in each of the three teams, it's possible with 22 people. And his side will always have two less people. That's why it'll be 6 to 4. In the third vote, if two people each... vote "yes" and "no," The vote will be 1 to 3. The winner will be... the one included in all three teams. This guy. No way. Is that guy... ...Betrayer X? Probably. Then... he might win this way... but if all the other teams signed contracts he has to divide the prize money with all 21 of them. That's why it's probable that he's Betrayer X. You'd be right if it was a normal contract. But if he joined the game after betraying a participant as an assistant, it's easy for him to manipulate a contract. If that's the case, Betrayer X will win the $2 million himself. Hold on. So, if all three teams have signed contracts... Right. Betrayer X is among us... and still survived. Then... Director Jung... Congressional Assistant Kim... Jung Ah... It's one of the three? That's the worst case scenario. H... Hold on. Even if other teams do exist, there's no guarantee there are only three. Aside from our team, couldn't this result occur if there's just one other? There is a slight possibility. Then it probably isn't the case. It can't be one of the three. The picture of Betrayer X showed a young man. It can't be. I understand you want to trust people. But in order to trust, you must suspect first. I need to verify. Goodness. Now that I think about it... it was suspicious ever since he showed the picture. You watch over Bong Geun, Lawyer. I'll watch Director Jung. I'll watch Jung Ah. No. In Gi, you watch Jung Ah. You watch the CCTV here. But... I'll do it. Don't worry, honey. You rest up comfortably. What about you, Woo Jin? I'm going to meet Choi Sung Joon and verify. Whether he's really Betrayer X or not. Let's move. Security Room We can't use our phones. So, if X is among the three, before the next vote... they'll approach the other team members. Don't take your eyes off the screen until the next vote. I'm so tired. So tired. Uh? Jeez. Bulldog spread rumors about us. We should at least do this. No one's here. Have you heard of playing hard to get? No, right? What in the world... Why did you make that statement earlier? Everyone is already suspicious. It has nothing to do with you. I don't think you're X. I can help you alleviate the suspicion. Take off your sunglasses. Why? If you see me, you can figure out everything? Are you that amazing? You have teams, right? Think what you want. But... what you're guessing... remember, it's not everything. None of them were acting suspiciously. Okay. Did you meet him? I think he might be the one. What did I tell you? Let's decide how we'll vote this time. This time... speak up if you want. Even if the prize money is divided, the winner... can skip the next round. What do we do? That guy is definitely Betrayer X. But if I vote yes, I think everyone else will, too. No. So, I have to vote no. Jeez, I don't know. Right. I'm sure voting no is the right answer. I'll vote no. I'm voting yes. The spirits will get angry. Jeez. Should I believe you? I'll vote no. He's caught in the trap. The important thing isn't finding the answer. It's who you're standing next to. Have you decided, Woo Jin? I wonder... I don't care which side. I'll vote yes then. Me, too. I'm gonna vote yes, too. You told me earlier that I'm thoughtless. We have to split in half. Jung Ah said she didn't care. Can't she switch? Why? Do you think you'll be eliminated if you side with me? You got that right. Winners have a special aura around them. Losers have auras, too. Depressing... and they smell bad. Whoa, whoa. - You jerk. - What are you doing? Stop it. If we slip up, we could be disqualified. I'll switch my vote, so please don't fight. I just have to vote no, right? I'm not forcing you. Since we all agreed... For everyone's mutual benefit, I'll sacrifice. Sacrifice, my ass. It's decided then. Jung Ah and I will vote yes. You two will vote no. The voting will start momentarily. Everyone please gather in the Hall. More coffee? I guess I'm nervous. Stop. It'll be fine. Question: I'm the notorious Betrayer X. The voting will start. Those with a voting card... Please come to the front and vote one by one. Staff member, begin the counting of the votes. Choi Sung Joon. Yes. Kwon Ki Ha. No. Jo Sung Il, no. Lee Min Jin, yes. Bulldog, no. Oh Jung Ah, yes. Bong Chun Dong, no. Ha Woo Jin, yes. Congressional Assistant Kim, no. Director Jung, no. Winner The results are 4 to 6. Those who voted yes, Choi Sung Joon, Lee Min Jin, Oh Jung Ah and Ha Woo Jin have survived. They have the right to vote again. The four participants named should come up and get their voting cards. He survived again. Why do you think? Hey. You asshole. What did you do? How do you keep surviving? Wh... What do you want? You're X, right? You said it yourself. You confused me with your dumbass question. What are you up to? Bulldog. This is your first warning for using violence. After your first warning, you will be forcibly eliminated after the second. - I'm letting you know. - You stupid little dumbass. I'll be watching you. Be careful, okay? I'll uncover you! All! Hey! If I get eliminated... I won't just stand back and watch. Take a look! There was a momentary ruckus but we'll move onto the next game now. The questioner for the next vote... Um... The last... remaining person... ...will be me. I'll give you time to think. For the sake of moving things along, please meet back to vote in 30 minutes. Countdown... ...begins! Question: I will be the last remaining person. Since it's just us, let's decide here. I'll vote no. What will you do now? No matter what that person does, we won't lose. No. The person holding the key to winning... ...is still that guy. Jung Ah, drinking coffee again? It's time. We'll begin the third vote. In this vote that will decide the winner, I myself will lead the proceedings on location. The four participants with voting cards... Please come forward and cast your votes. Now. All four participants have voted. If the results are a tie, we'll go right into a re-vote. If the results are 1 to 3, that one person... will be the winner... and receive... ...$2 million. Who will that person be? I'll personally... ...find out. The first vote... ...is Choi Sung Joon. "No." If the remaining three votes are yes, Sung Joon will be the winner. He'll win $2 million. Can you tell us... ...how you feel? Who knows? You were suspected of being Betrayer X. If it really is you, why don't you reveal yourself now? Are you... ...Betrayer X? I'm sure you already know. I'll respond just like you did earlier. Who knows? We'll continue the tally. The second vote... Lee Min Jin. "No." With that, Choi Sung Joon and Lee Min Jin have lost... the chance to win. But Min Jin... you're more stoic than I would've expected. That is... Are you hoping for a re-vote? That's right. It's good not to lose hope. Now... we'll continue the tally. The third vote... Oh Jung Ah. "Yes!" Finally, we have a yes. If Ha Woo Jin has voted no, Jung Ah becomes the winner. Jung Ah... how do you feel? If the winner has been decided, and you... receive $2 million... what will you do? Um... Well... I don't know. I can only think of my mom. Say something... ...to your mother. Huh? Oh. Um... Mom. You had a hard time because of me, Mom. I'll... bring money... and be good to you. And... Um... I love you, Mom. Yes... How do you feel, Ha Woo Jin? You already... ...know the result. Will Jung Ah's... ...hope come true? We won. Jung Ah. Jung Ah. Are you okay? "We?" "We?" Like Nam Da Jung, I wanted to throw a pity party. I can't do it though. I told you. The winner would be me. As promised, everyone voted no thankfully. But what do I do? I'm going to take the $2 million for myself. I voted "yes" all by myself. Yes! L... Liar. We agreed to split the winnings. We did. With everyone here. So, what? Jung Ah. Don't call me such a country bumpkin name. Call me... ...Jamie. Understand? Identification Card Liar Game Film the participants' reactions and bring up the edited out footage of Jamie. One... Two... Who is Jung Ah? Now! My friend who participated in the first round of Liar Game. Stupid bitch. Even though she gave up all $500K to me as an assistant, she let me borrow her ID card because I gave her some money. So, I told the TV station... This is my strategy. So, don't broadcast it. That's why the contract is... ...null and void. Why? Because I didn't do it! Do you get it now? If you make teams, you can divide the prize money cooperatively. Did it ease your mind? How did you get this far by being so naive? There's... no rule that there can only be one team. The moment I made three teams... this game was over. I overheard Nam Da Jung and Ha Woo Jin talking. I got a hint there. If I do this right, I won't just survive. I can win it all myself. Me If I made three teams... and I'm included in all of them... the side I vote on is bound to win. Isn't it great? It was really hard pulling the team together in the beginning. But it was worth it. In Round 1, Nam Da Jung and Ha Woo Jin played the lead roles. But from now on, it's me. But we watched. That sly bitch. She's a better actor than me. Acting naive. How embarrassing. How do you feel, Angel Nam Da Jung? You hate me even if it's you, right? Don't you want to insult and beat me? Do it. Spit in my face. Go ahead. You can't do it on camera? Or play to your strengths of pretending to be pitiful and kind-hearted. Beg and cry for favors. It'll make a great picture if you beg and plead. The ratings will soar. Jeez. There's no reaction. How boring. Because I already knew. What? What did you just say? We'll verify the final vote now. If Ha Woo Jin voted no, Oh Jung Ah... I mean... Jamie... will be the winner. The final vote... Ha Woo Jin. Yes! It's a tie! What? What is this? You said you'd vote "no." You told me we won! I did. You revealed yourself as a result. How did you know? Since when? I sensed you were hiding something from the start. You were always under scrutiny. But I let it go for the time being. No one here wants to be revealed and kept their distance. It was hard to discern what they were hiding. When you stood up to Bulldog, it was genuine. You probably were beaten by a man in the past... or have a personal story there. At any rate, you pointed out Choi Sung Joon as Betrayer X. You raised suspicion. You simultaneously avoided suspicion that way. You were able to gain other teammates' trust. But when the first vote ended 10 to 12. And before the second voting result was 4 to 6, I was certain. Even if we agreed to divide the prize money equally, the winner could skip the next round. It's obvious to want to be the winner. Like those two. I don't care which side. I'll vote yes. But you said you didn't care which side. As far as I could tell, you were being honest. I'll switch my vote, so please don't fight. I just have to vote no, right? You weren't conceding. You were certain you'd win no matter... which way you voted. How could you know I was Betrayer X with that? Are you a fortuneteller or something? Wanna hear more? How you voted without contacting other team members? Since you were in three different groups, meeting members must've been difficult. So, with the threat that the plan could be exposed... In order for the remaining members to vote according to your signal, you had a plan set up. If you drink coffee, vote yes. If you don't, vote no. Am I wrong? It must've been tough drinking several cups on purpose. We're just back to the beginning. Everyone's in the same situation again. Even if you act like you're all that, you and I both have a 4 in 1 chance of winning. Am I wrong? You think so? Now... due to a 2 to 2 tie, we'll begin a re-vote. After the re-vote question has been posed, you may vote immediately. You'll be given ten minutes. If you don't vote within ten minutes, you will forfeit automatically. Please keep that in mind. Now then. The next questioner... ...is Ha Woo Jin! What question will you pose for us to enjoy? I'm looking forward to it. Woo Jin? My question is this... The most important thing in life... ...is money. I've already decided, so I'll vote immediately. My answer... as you can see... ...is no. As expected, Ha Woo Jin is exceeding all expectation. In this nerve-racking situation that may determine a winner, he has confidently revealed his vote which seems like it should be kept... ...confidential. Why is he showing that? I know. Hold on. No way... What is this? Damn it. How annoying! I don't think Jamie likes Ha Woo Jin's decision to reveal his vote. Anyway, the other participants will also have to decide soon. Ten minutes... is not... a very... ...long time. Question: The most important thing in life is money. Excuse me. Can't we do like we did in the beginning? Shut up if you don't know anything. I need to think. Congressional Assistant... What on earth is going on? Ha Woo Jin revealed his vote. What is she stressing about? I'm not sure. Use your brains. If Woo Jin votes no, what do they have to do to win? Vote yes, right? But if all three of them vote yes... then Woo Jin will win. Right. What should they do to stop Woo Jin from winning? Someone... has to sacrifice. Sacrifice! Right, right. The only way one of the three can win is to agree to divide the prize money and only one person votes yes. Is that possible? With those people? When you wanted to edit out Jamie's footage from Round 1, I was against it. I didn't know you were making me accrue debt. You've grown a lot. Five minutes left. Darn it. The one who revealed first is at an advantage. Hey. You, too. There's a way. The three of us need to form a team. I'm not lying this time. I'll write a real contract this time. Only one person vote yes. Divide the $2 million equally amongst us, okay? Sh... Should we? Are you kidding me? Jamie was faking it from the start. But we were being sincere. If one of us two wins, we agreed to divide the prize money. That's right. Until the end, you... So, what? Will you lose like this? No. We can't divide it equally. You take $40K. What? If we take you out and divide it amongst the remaining 14 people, it's only $140K per person. Is that right? That's right. Why divide it? If one of you two win, just divide it with that team. No. Don't do that. Just... ...support me. Then you don't have to split it. The three of us can get more money. $667K each. What do you think? What's going on? Since... the contract is messed up, they won't easily agree. What do you think? Before we divide it or whatnot, I don't want the same amount as this woman. Then you take 677K. No. 900K, 900K and 200K for you. Are you kidding... 200K? You're worse than me. One minute left. If you don't vote within that time, you'll forfeit automatically. Forget that for now. Let's decide how to vote before talking about the money. What do we do? Aren't you planning on switching your vote, so you win? Oh, my goodness. So... how can we trust her? No. Don't you get the situation? We don't have time! Fine. I'll vote for everyone, so there won't be any tricks. I'll vote no. Okay, okay. Pull out your yes card, bitch. Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One. I'll reveal the voting results now. Voting Results Jamie. Yes. Lee Min Jin. Yes. I should have won the $2 million myself. Because of that asshole. Ha Woo Jin. No. Choi Sung Joon. Yes. Ha Woo Jin! Ha Woo Jin! Ha Woo Jin! With the score of 1-3, Ha Woo Jin is the winner! Woo Jin. Explain to the viewers what happened with the... ...final vote. There was a rumor Choi Sung Joon was Betrayer X. After I met him, I knew he wasn't Betrayer X. You have teams, right? Think what you want. Touching his nose while talking... means he's not confident in his words... ...or lying. No matter what that person does, we won't lose. The person holding the key to winning... ...is still that guy. Meet that guy. What? Why me? He's been under suspicion this whole time. He's probably going crazy with anxiety and worry. If I mess with him while he's fully on guard, he'll run away. But still... how can I do what you can't? Being too kind is a disorder. But it's not completely useless. You... Ow! That hurts. I'm sorry. I tried to be careful. No. You don't have to be sorry. You look really young without your sunglasses. How old are you? Well... I'm... probably similar in age... ...to you. You're not X, are you? Just say you aren't. I was afraid and suspicious of you. They thought of it however they want. What can I do? All done. But... how did you know? That I'm not X. X is Oh Jung Ah. She suggested forming teams, right? If you want to stop Oh Jung Ah from winning $2 million by herself, we have to become a team starting now. We agreed to split the $2 million instead of Betrayer X. We recruited Choi Sung Joon to our team. We drew out the time and induced a re-vote. Switching the vote at the end... it was planned out. Ha Woo Jin. Nam Da Jung. According to your respective contracts, there are eight bags prepared. The opportunity for eliminated participants to be reinstated will go to those who won some money as you guessed. Except Ha Woo Jin who won this round, the seven people are... - reinstated to the next round... - What the hell is this! That's my money. I was part of the contract. It's my money. Mine! My money. My money! - My fingerprint was... - Jamie. You received your first warning for use of violence. Hey! Hey! Yes? Alright. We'll stop filming momentarily. Director! Kang Do Young. Reveal that Jamie's contract is valid. No way! Why not? She signed the contract. She was the one with the strategy. But it's not her identity. Who cares? In the game, we permit nicknames. She entered the game with the nickname "Jung Ah." Her contract as Jung Ah is valid. Shall I call my personal lawyer... ...for a consultation? Lawyer? No need for all that. It happened within the game. Director. That's a scheme! What scheme? This is entertainment! Why are you talking about legality and schemes when it's entertainment? People will talk once this is aired. So, what? Even if controversial things happen, bring me the people who criticize. By any means necessary, I'll cover it no matter what. What do you think? Well? Honestly, it'd be no fun if she left. What happened? Let's go. Liar Game Hey! Open the door! Damn it. Long time no see. I saw the whole thing. It was really fun. You took off your wig and glasses and ta-da. It was a total reversal. You saw? You bitch, you slyly approached me. You always talked about dividing the prize money. What did you say? I just had to be careful of Betrayer X. But you totally played me. What's wrong, oppa? Oppa? Fine. This oppa doesn't seem like he'll hit a woman, right? TV show or whatever... I'm going to have to teach you a lesson today. You're so impatient. You should wait a little bit before you teach me a lesson. Shut up! I will reveal the producers agreement now. The contract Jamie made as Oh Jung Ah with many participants... it has been deemed valid. Although a contract made under a false name isn't legally valid, in this round, nicknames were permitted. Since Jamie joined the game as Oh Jung Ah, there is no issue... according to our producers' judgment. That's some nerve. What about Sung Joon? Do we have to divide with that person? The spirits say no. Excuse me. Then I'll... - share with... - I'm the one who said I'd give you money. Take this. What? Nothing. You'll receive your share of the prize money and move onto the reinstatement game. Come to the Hall. You can't do this to me. Why! I'm going to save you. Hi! My money's here somewhere. Anyone seen it? What? Wanna smell it? You little... Sit. Here. The promised amount. Now then, I'll reveal the participants of the reinstatement game! The nine people with prize money... will play in the reinstatement game! Jung Ah. Jamie. Save me, too. Okay? Jamie! Lawyer Go, I can't go. Only Jamie got the prize money? Lawyer Go. Lawyer Go! Excuse me. Save me! Excuse me! Do you think it'll benefit them to continue? Hurry up. Don't leave! Save me! I thought... taking the prize money in the middle of the show would be better. This is a burden. By chance... did anyone already spend their prize money? Nobody touch their money. It's not ours yet. Jeez. Are you flirting with the money? Excuse me. Staff oppa. By chance... do you know what the reinstatement game is about? How many people will be eliminated? Um... I shouldn't tell you. Just give me a hint. I can't tell you anything. But I heard one person would be eliminated. Thank you. Can... ...we talk? I told you I would treat. Didn't you hear earlier? Not to spend your money. I can afford to buy a meal without the prize money. Forget it. More than that, what do you want to say? Actually... I wanted to ask you something. What? I thought of it when I saw those people begging to be helped. Why are we doing this? If we all agreed to share the prize money no matter who wins, there's no reason to fight... ...or be in debt. Wouldn't everyone be happy? You really thought hard with that brain... ...unnecessarily. Why? Isn't it right? It might be possible with ten people like you. But if just one person betrays, no... if someone even suspects someone will betray, it's over. In that situation, the last person who decides to betray is ruined. Worse than that... is what the person who decided to trust will experience. Can't you guess who that will be? But... isn't that a way to win? Trust one another instead of fighting and suspecting. Why are you always so negative? If that were easy, would the world be the way it is? Would people even gather to watch such a senseless show? So, I want to try. We can show everyone what is means to trust one another. Come to your senses. You'll be in debt going into the reinstatement game with that kind of attitude. Woo Jin. Why don't you trust people? You said you suspect in order to trust. But do you even want to trust? If it's not because of money, why... are you doing this? It has nothing to do with you. Forget about it and take care of your bag. Ahjussi. What happened? Really? $250K? Wow! Nam Da Jung! You're pretty good. Huh? It's all because of Woo Jin. Right? Stick close to Ha Woo Jin. Hold on. No, what I mean is... Just... don't stick too close... but stick to him. Okay. Stick? It's nothing. Since when did $250K... ...become nothing? Huh? Dal Goo. Jo Dal Goo. Move your hand. You'll get hurt. What the... hell are... ...you doing? Huh? What are you doing? You don't bring the money you were sent for... acting like that girl's knight in shining armor? Huh? Are you dating? Are you going out with her? Since you got out of jail, it's weird, right? Is it shocking? Come to your senses, man. This place... ...is hell. Damn it. Whew. My goodness... Whew? You didn't even lock your door. Are you crazy? You're relieved to see a creditor. Ugh. I guess so. What are you doing? You just won ten year's worth of my salary. Why are you so down? Did something happen? Did Ha Woo Jin yell at you? No. I'm right. What do you mean no? Smart guys are really rude. But... what happened to your face? This? I went to collect money. You're nicer than you look. I need to give up this work. Is the money bag a bike? Do you know how many bikes you can buy with $250K? That's why you're here. - Goodness. - Really? Um... Da Jung. I thought about it. But you know... the money you borrowed from my company? The interest has gone up. With your prize money, how about repaying that first? I know it's not an easy decision. I know the TV station will ask for it back if you get eliminated. But you can repay it slowly. They won't charge high 40-50% interest rates like us. Right? Are you sleeping? Okay. Liar Game Pitiful wench. Only if her dad hadn't made a bad investment... Where is it? Invested where? Is there anything I should know in advance? I'm getting a little suspicious. Da Jung, aren't you curious? Why Ha Woo Jin is helping you? Why isn't Woo Jin coming? Why don't you call him, Da Jung? Starting now... the game will officially begin. Damn it, in this urgent situation... are you going to do this, Jung Ah? Answer the phone.
