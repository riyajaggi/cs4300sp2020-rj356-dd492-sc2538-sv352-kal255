 According to research, most people come across about 200 lies. Three times in ten minutes. You can't believe it? If the questions I ask apply to you, please be honest and raise your hand. I've cheated on exams. Rolling your eyes to the left means you're trying to remember. Your body temperature increases and heartbeat speeds up. Your defensive behavior. Nervous? I've stolen money before. I have a crush on... someone in this lecture hall.

 Two in the back! With thirty people in this room, within a minute... total of nine lies came up. If I calculate ten minutes per person, three times... Do you acknowledge this? So, if we were to include white lies, most people lie more often. So... never... trust... ...anyone. This is what I want to leave with you at my last lecture. Your last? I killed someone. One year later Miss. I'm bad with directions. How do I get here? I'm really sorry, but I'm in a hurry. Really? I'm sorry. Oh, no... Ugh... What should I do... Excuse me. Ma'am. I'll help you. - I thought you were busy. - It's okay. Please be careful. It must be heavy. It's okay. It's my fault for not tending to your business. Oh, no. It's okay. I think it's around here. Miss, can you wait for me here? I have to... ...use the restroom. Ah, sure. Go ahead. I think it's around here. Ma'am. Ma'am. Sung Ja Yeah. Nam Da Jung, you're too much. Why are you waiting over an hour? She left her bag with me. It's probably her clothes and blankets. Just leave it there. Should I leave it at the police station? Hey, would she have left it with you if it was valuable in the first place? Why don't you open it if it bothers you? Alright. JVN Broadcasting Station Everyone wears... ...a mask. Good... evil... compassion... conscience... justice... Names of these masks. From time to time, we mistake those masks to be our real selves. But here, without any exception... we take off... ...all those masks. High... Cue. Your true self looking at this money... what would it be? I'm the host of this show... Kang Do Young. Liar Game Episode 1 - Half a million dollars game 1 100 dollar bills. $5000 bunch... ...98, 99, 100. Exactly half a million dollars. They're all new bills. What's all this money and who is that grandma? Why did she give me this money to a stranger like me? Phone bill, utilities, tuition, rent due. I have to find the owner. That's why I brought it here. Right... Right... Let's just stay this way for a minute. As soon as the sun comes up, I'll take it to the police. Hey, Nam Da Jung! Is Nam Da Jung here? Nam Da Jung! How dare you sleep in without depositing your interest? Uh... I still have two more days. Oh, yeah? Food. Food! Feed me! I don't have any. Did I hold food for you? I'm changing right now. See you later. You always make breakfast. Were you planning to run away and fell asleep? No way... Look at her... Look at her... Nam Da Jung... Nam Da Jung... Let me see you, Nam Da Jung... What are you doing? I'll report you for trespassing. Game over. Nam Da Jung. Nam Da Jung, you... Hey! Hey! - Hey! - Hey, hey... How dare you break into someone's home? Huh? It's my dad's debt. It's not mine! Huh? Hey, it's a frame. Wow... Wow... Hey... Put an egg. Did you give me food to keep? Jeez... What's this? Looking for a server. Server... Server... You, short timer... Look for a good job, not these temp jobs. Forget it. How did you find my emergency key? Oh, that? When I was in prison for a short time, there was this guy who was super smart. The odd thing about that guy was that he always read a book upside down. Was he illiterate? He'd glance right through and say it's not fun. He said he can see what he missed if he reads it upside down. Isn't that neat? So, I tried it out myself. I thought to myself, where would I hide the key if I were you? He had this famous saying. "People are complex, but..." "...that's why they are such simple animals." So awesome... Isn't that cool? Huh? He speaks so easily. Forget other people. You're really easy to figure out. Don't make me laugh. Hey... But... there's a bag in your room I don't recognize. It's not mine. Someone misplaced it. Someone asked me to keep it and disappeared. Look at you... You're too nice. Ugh... Hey, there's no kimchee. Do you have kimchee on the balcony? Hey, why did you bring that with you? You didn't even report it as lost and found. Well, I had to work. I have to go work now. What's inside? Not sure. Is it money? Hey! Nam Da Jung! Hey! Ow... Nam Da Jung! Hey, Da Jung! Wait for me, Da Jung! Where are you going? Taxi! Go to the nearest police station. How much? This is all yours. Hey, hey! Da Jung! Hey! That, that girl... Hey! Do you know what happens if you take it to the police? You'll get arrested for stealing evidence! The minute you walk in with that, you're condemned as a criminal. Got that? Ahjussi refers to a non-related male. Ahjussi, look ahead and drive. Hey, stop! I'm telling you, that's dirty money. Even if you report it, the owner won't get it back. It's none of your business. What do you mean? I... I... Look, look! I'm Jo Dal Goo! Don't follow me! Stop! Ahjussi, step on it! Hurry, hurry! Da Jung. Da Jung! Goodness... ugh... Why read? C'mon... Jeez... You'll turn into a bear. Professor Ha. Hey! Wait. Hey, Nam Da Jung. It must be a lot. She's crazy, crazy. Nam Da Jung, this isn't it. Nam Da Jung, this isn't right. This isn't right. This isn't right. Let go. Let go! I won't. I won't! Pay off your debt first if you want to restore your conscience. Let go. Right now! I'll call the police! You want it, honestly. Isn't that why you dragged it to your house? That's right. I wanted it, too. It felt great to sleep on top of a pile of money. There you go. What's there to worry about? Turn around and go home. Pay off that gross debt! Pay rent, tuition, pretty clothes. Get a brand name bag, too! And sleep on top of this pile every night. What's your problem? How can I? Would I sleep soundly that way? That old lady and her family... They'll go in debt because of me and lose everything in their house. Their daughter will have to give up her dream like me. Live like pouring water into a broken jar. Having numerous part-time jobs that pay $5 an hour isn't enough. How can I do that if I think of someone like you bothering me constantly? Wait. What's this? Wait, wait. Hello? Nam Da Jung, there's a reality show where you can win up to 10 million dollars. You have been chosen as a contestant for the show, Liar Game. What is it? If you want to have that half a million dollars in your hands, press 1. If you don't want to, just hang up. Half a million dollars. Liar Game Hello? Hello? I pressed the wrong button just now. Hello? Hello? Hello? What's going on? Is he... ...causing you trouble? No, it's nothing. I welcome you to... ...the Liar Game. Dong Bu Police Station Hair loss from stress. Sleep depravation. Chronic itch. Desk job. He could've been laid off recently. Obsessive personality and right handed. Fold mark around his sleeves. Who... ...are you? Am I dressed funny? Don't worry. I owe a favor to the detective. I'm here to help him. More than that... I heard you said you have nothing to do with the incident. You passed the lie detector. Why are you detaining an innocent person? Huh? Kidnap? You guys are making a huge mistake. You know? I think so, too. So, I'm about to change the method. Oh, no... From the fold mark around your sleeves, you normally pull it up. But you're wearing it down. Hiding your left arm looks suspicious. Looking at the size of the teeth mark, it's probably a girl around 7 or 8. Did you kill the child? You're fearful even though you didn't kill her. Are you afraid she'll die and your list of crimes will grow? Are you starting to worry about that? You taped her up and locked her up. In a small space. Somewhere there's not enough air... A car trunk? The possibility of asphyxiation isn't entirely out of the question. The car must be near where you got arrested. It must be a stolen car for sure. In a public parking structure... Basement? What type of car? It must be a monotone car... Black... ...or gray. Compact SUV? Or SUV? Right? Ugh, al... alright.. I'll tell you everything. What did he do before? He's a human lie detector. Jeez... I want to introduce you to the... JVN Broadcasting Station ...thirteenth contestent. First recording of the Liar Game Alright. Okay... Hello, Da Jung. It's nice to meet you. Were you... ...quite shocked? I'm still not sure about it. Whether it's a dream or reality. Of course, you are. You made it through an unbelievable chance of making it on this show... ...as a contestant. Excuse me. Let me ask you direction. Ma'am. Ma'am, I'll help you. Hurry. That old lady is an actress we hired. Until she met a nice lady like you, Da Jung... no one... ...bothered to help her. If inside that bag... people knew half a million dollars were in it, what would've happened? Probably everyone would've jumped to help... ...creating a chaos. When you first found out about the money inside the bag, how did you feel? "I should take it back to the old lady no matter what." Is that what you were thinking? Well, that's... Actually... There is no way you would've waited for her at the same spot for so long. We live in a world where money solves everything. Who else would've behaved like Da Jung? But... Da Jung decides to go home after waiting for six hours. Why did you do that? First of all... I was out of my mind. - I didn't have any bad thoughts. - Of course not. Such a huge amount of money... ...was in your hands. Late at night... rather than waiting in a dangerous open space, you thought it best to take it to your safe home and... as soon as the sun comes up, you wanted to take it to... ...the police station. Is that right? Y... Yes... Among 50 million people in Korea, only 50 people passed this test... to be on this show. Through a previous audience vote, 10 people were disqualified and... only 40 people have... ...made it to the show. Final 40 contestants This isn't the end? Da Jung. This isn't the end... ...but the beginning. If you're included as one of 40 finalists, you'll get to play the Liar Game. First round is for half a million dollars. The rule is simple. Deceive the other person... to win that suitcase with half million dollars in it. Forget your conscience. Everyone is... here... ...to deceive one another. What's wrong? Well... I'm not confident. Deceiving people and all... Are you saying you may not participate? I'm not smart enough to deceive anyone. Of course, Nam Da Jung... has a side to her... ...that's different than others. Being able to let go of a chance at the final prize of $10 million... That's not meant... ...for just anyone. That's fine. There's the audience voting results and... even if she's chosen, she has the right to contemplate her participation until the next recording. Our Da Jung has... more than... ...enough time. In order for her to walk away with the prize, she must deceive and be suspicious. Would it be good for her to participate in the Liar Game... or would it be better to give up like she just mentioned? We'll conduct an Internet vote... for viewer opinion... ...please. Let's wrap up now. Wrap up. Please move these over there please, you two. To the right. Okay. Excuse me. I want to say something. Sure. Um... Actually... I was momentarily greedy when I saw the bag. That's why I took it home. Please don't air the portion I was on. Nam Da Jung... You're really a good person now that I meet you. But you're really bad at math. The pay to appear on this show is quite high even without the prize money. The money you'll make working several part-time jobs for months... you can make it in one recording. You may not be able to pay off your debt... but you shouldn't increase it, right? Thank you for your concern, but... I won't be on even if I get picked. I don't want to take money for deceiving someone. What about deception? Are you sure you're not afraid to lose? I don't like to compete. You live your life with a goody two-shoes cosplay. No wonder you live the way you do. At the moment... you have every right to... ...say that to me. You're young, pretty and capable. Of course, you make a lot more money than I do. But don't think that... it's because you did your best and I didn't. The world you live in... was just a whole lot... kinder to you than my world was to me. Crazy, crazy! Ugh, really... Enjoy. Did I do that right? $5 is missing. Oh, really? "Oh, really?" Hey, we're losing an hours wage. $5 an hour. How long do I have to work to make $500K? What? Hey. Hey. Huh? Where's your head? What are you babbling about? $5... $5! Did we drop it? It shouldn't be missing. I found $5 here. Thank you! Teacher. I really didn't do it, Teacher. Yeah. I'm also aware you're not the type of person to do that. But why did the class president think that you stole it? Well... because I'm the only one who hasn't paid for the class trip. Hey, why did you do that? Just for fun. As you all know... I received a report something bad happened in our class. But... it turned out to be a misunderstanding. Just to be sure, I looked around... the field, school shop, even around the school. And... I found it in the gymnasium. Oh, yeah. Nam Da Jung. I found this near the gym locker, too. Everyone take care of your things. Oh, boy... I can't accept this. It's your money. I really found it. I found it on the side. More than that... Who would've known we'd meet again... ...this way? Is your father well? Actually... he left home wanting to make money to pay off the debt... it's been awhile since we lost touch with him. That's too bad. Money is always the issue. Even for me... I can't face my family until I pay off my debt. Why not? My wife and child are overseas. A teacher's salary isn't bad, but... I unknowingly accumulated debt. I retired now and... I want to stop living alone and... ...want to be with my family. I had no idea... ...about your situation. But isn't life interesting? I didn't know I'd compete with you the first round. Excuse me? Didn't you see the chart? Nam Da Jung vs. Hyun Jung Bum Oh, my... I heard you decided not to participate. So, I was thinking... what do you think about participating? Who knows? If you get your prize on TV, your dad won't have to run because of the debt. He may return. But I have to compete with you. Isn't that better than competing against a stranger? Fortunately, the TV station doesn't know you and I are teacher and student. So... let's go on the Liar Game. I'll lose on purpose. Excuse me? You'll be the winner. And... we can split the prize in half. First prize is half a million dollars. But that's... ...a deception. Right. I'm saying let's deceive the TV station that's trying to have us deceive each other. If we can trust each other completely, we can definitely walk away with half the prize. Well... since people can't trust each other, that's why they're lying and fighting each other. You and I becoming a team is... ...perhaps Heaven's will. What happens... ...if I forfeit? What else can I do? Just... think it wasn't meant to be mine. Don't be pressured. Liar Game Yes... um... you just watched the trailers for the Liar Game. From now on... What a sight. I thought they wanted to revive the station. Forget reviving... this will ruin us. Yes. You were on another station's show as a financial analyst and claimed danger of bankruptcy at JVN. How did you come to host the reality show? When I spoke of the crisis of some new broadcasters, it was a warning. And it's become a reality now. Fortunately, JVN management consulted me after hearing what I had to say. I personally recommended... ...this program. The most interesting thing about working with money is... watching people... wavering and... ...becoming honest. And I believe that will become an exciting entertainment for us. Next question please. If the final prize is truly $10 million, the production budget must be astronomical. How did you come up with such a budget in the current state of the TV station? As you know, I do have some money. Let's just say there are investors... who are interested in JVN's revival. By chance, are you betting on its disposal? Sort of speak... they call it "water bread." I see. This isn't a forum to reveal the company management philosophy... ...so I won't go there. I can say one thing for sure. I never compete in... ...a losing fight. In any case... you want to use money to raise the rating. Isn't the motive too obvious? Reporter. Your words are too harsh. You're right. Does anyone dislike money? I'm sure you all feel the same way. Ah, let me... ...make a suggestion. From now until midnight of the first broadcast, to the news who writes an article on our show and has the most hits, I will pay... ...$500K in advertising. I repeat, it's according to how many hits. Which means... as long as it's highly exposed, whether it's controversial or insulting, it doesn't matter. He's pulling out all the stops. Liar Game. The reality show at its worst playing with money. Liar Game - selling out your conscience over money. Liar Game Who knows? If you get your prize on TV, your dad won't have to run because of debt. He may return. Dad. Dad. I'm sorry. - You know her? - No. Let's go. Dal Goo. You know our client, Nam Da Jung. She still hasn't paid back the principal. Well... She's still a student and has a hard time finding a real job. She's working part-time jobs as much as she can... Jeez... What to do? Why not connect her to a bar? She'll get some regular customers with her pretty face. If not... I'll become her regular everyday. What a jerk... Look at him speak... What's with your expression? Nothing. Do your job right, okay? The economy is bad these days. Where would you go if you quit here with your criminal record? Don't get scared. I'll take care of it. Sure, go for it. You know... Did the TV station call you again? Why? No, just because... I was thinking, you won't find... Never mind. Is ramen ready yet? Wait. It's almost finished. "When the chamomile flowers bloom..." This place is... popular for their noodles. Is she a movie star? Let's eat... Thank you for the food. Ooh, hot. How much is my dad's debt including the interest? Why? How much is it? Jeez... Wait. Let's see. Nam Hyun Sik. A little less than $150K. You thief! How can $30K become $150K? Hey. There are others with more. How much does a place like this cost? Well? Even if it's real small... ...about $60-70K? Then let's say it's $70K. $220K to buy a house and pay off the debt. I'm still left with $30K. Even if I go back to school, I wouldn't have to worry about tuition. What are you saying? No, nothing. Eat. - Have some kimchee, too. - Okay. Wow... Round 1 [$500K game] First recording Through pre-voting by the viewers via the website, total of 40 contestants have been... ...chosen. The disappointing reality is that... Nam Da Jung forfeited as a contestant and was ranked on top with the most votes. Nam Da Jung (age 25, female) Unemployed Even though we're very close to begin the recording, she has not appeared to the show. Still a no show? A phone call? 3 minutes from now... No, 2 minutes and 58 seconds later... Just a moment please. Yes! Just now... Nam Da Jung just walked into the studio. Yes... The stars always show up late. Is it something like that? I'm sorry. Let's take a breath. Okay. Can I ask you how you came to change your mind? You did actually decide to appear at the last minute. So, we'll make it very dramatic. When the host starts the count down... you just wait and... run into the studio when I give you the cue. - And... - But... do I have to talk about my dad? The broadcast is... to attract viewers. It's a show. It's not like you're lying about it. Don't you want... your father to see the show? Don't overthink it. Just be genuine when you speak. Actually... I came on the show because of... one person who must feel bad for me. Cue. Dad... I'm doing well. When I win the prize... you won't have to run because of the debt. We can live together. I'll win for sure and get the prize money. Come home. Paying off the debt with the prize money. Wanting to live with her dad... That's Da Jung's wish. I'm sure... there are many who want... that wish to come true. Alright, from now... first round that sets the stage for the real thing... I'll explain the rules that goes with... ...the $500K. Inside the briefcase in front of each of you... you'll find $500,000 in cash. The rule is simple. You protect your own and... taking away... ...the other person's money. You have seven days. Whoever ends up with the most money wins. You can use any methods except for physical violence. The important aspect of this game is... by protecting alone... you can't gain anything. Then, how can you take the other person's money? You can mutually bet or gamble. Play trickery or... according to one's ability... you can even steal. So, the money you take away from the other person... is the prize money you'll receive. From this round alone... you can get as high as... ...$500,000. From this point on, our show's staff will notify you... with the smart phones you received... Everyone's whereabouts are... exposed to real time... by our camera team. Alright then... we'll begin the $500K game. Do not trust... ...anyone. Cut. Liar Game - Participant Contract Broadcast appearance contract Did you study the part about forfeiting penalty and contestant chances? Excuse me? I sent it to you in an email. Didn't you read it? Well... I wasn't clear. Forfeiting penalty means you have to return a portion of your prize money. Contestant chance means... Let's record for now and... read it later. I'll start the recording. You have been given total of $500K. Did you confirm? The game money you received has its own serial number. These serial numbers should match up at the end of the game... in order to verify your win. Good luck. Teacher. What should I do now? Yeah. We should keep our money... where we can both trust. For now, when they stop watching us... let's meet again. Will we be alright? Da Jung. I trust you. Remember that. In a week... we'll have $500K. Remember, half of that is yours. Sorry for not telling you sooner. You did good. Good. Much better than working stupid part-time jobs. $500K in one shot! You should grab the fortune when it's coming your way. Did you keep the briefcase safe? Hey. Jeez... It's not like that. I'm just worried for you. Don't worry, I put it away safely. Okay. Hey... You know... You have to take the other person's money. I gave it some thought. Use an expert. No, it's okay. Hey, listen. I told you before. There's an amazing trickster I met in prison. I hear he's coming out soon. So, get him and use him. I'll take care of it. Hey, what do you mean? You shouldn't be so naive about this. Hey. - You're too nice... - I said it's okay! Oh, yeah? Why get annoyed? Feed me. Teacher. Are you still recording? Yes. How long do I have to keep this briefcase? I'm so uncomfortable. Wait until dawn and... I'll call you. Bring it out then. Okay. Da Jung. Hurry up and get in. Where are we going? To the bank. Bank? Can we deposit it at the bank? No. Everyone would leave the money there then. I'm sure that's why they said the serial numbers should match. If you deposit it in the bank... it's still money, but... not the same game money from the show. Then... why are we going to the bank? There's a secret safe in the bank. We should place the money there until the show is over. What do you think? Do you think this is safe? Here, you keep the key. Me? Did you forget? You're supposed to win. The last day when you get it back, bring the camera team and open it yourself. I trust you. I can, right? Yes. It looks nice. It's expensive. It's my daughter's birthday gift. I can afford this. I'll buy you a nice suit when I make some money. Read another book and meet another boy instead of working your part-time job. But Da Jung... I'm sorry, but... I'll go away for awhile. Where? To make money. I don't like this, Dad. It won't take long. I'll pay off the debt and return. Who is it for? For my dad. His birthday is coming up. How about this? It feels really soft, doesn't it? Yes, it really is. It's the best of the line, so the price is a bit high. Would you like to see something else? - No, I'll take this one. - Okay. First day of the Liar Game broadcast Nam Da Jung (age 25, unemployed) Dad. I'm doing well. When I win the prize... you won't have to run because of the debt. We can live together. What's that? Goodness... I'll win for sure and get the prize money. This is all set up. Why bother watching it? Jeez... Why, why, why? You've been arrested five times for fraud. You still can't see through people? Look at her eyes! She starts tearing up. Does she look like she's lying? Oh, my... Does my face say "I'm a trickster"? Yeah. What a joke... It's been two days since the $500,000 game started. Other teams are figuring out their methods. Score change by one of the teams But here is a team who changed their score first. That team is... the one who's already receiving all of your attention... Nam Da Jung and Hyun Jung Bum's Angel Team. - No, I'll take this one. - Okay. Where did you go this morning? Where's the briefcase? Da Jung, did something good happen? Mid-score: Nam Da Jung $0 - Hyun Jung Bum $1 million What's this? This can't be! What's this? I knew it! That girl is too nice! No way... That teacher is such a con man. Really. What happened, huh? Professor Ha. Those two... They acted all naive, but they knew each other. Wh... What? What's this? This can't be! Mid-score: Nam Da Jung $0 - Hyun Jung Bum $1 million Nam Da Jung and Hyun Jung Bum's mid-score result. What really happened? What exactly... ...happened to these two people? The fact that they were teacher and student... We... ...already knew. But Da Jung had no idea. It was the... Nam and Hyun decide to keep the money at a bank safe easiest way... ...to get the $500K. Why can't I? I can't confirm the safe ownership with one key alone. The official person on the account should be accompanied. Teacher! Teacher, this is Da Jung! Teacher, open the door! Teacher! Please open the door. It's Da Jung! Teacher, open the door! Please Teacher! Da Jung. Nam Da Jung! Hey! Open the door! Hey! What's with that teacher, jerk! Hey! You can't be like this. You have to find a way. I'll give up now. What? That money wasn't mine to begin with. I'll quit. Quit now? Are you kidding me? I thought you were gonna pay off the debt and find your dad! Did you think it'd be that easy to win that money? What do I do then? There's no way. Ugh! Why not? You have to find a way! You're too nice! Aren't you angry he tricked you? Let's go find him. Let's go find him! Find him? Who? I told you! My prison friend. Genius trickster, expert liar. Professor Ha is being released tomorrow. Professor? Liar Game I... lost my $500,000 to a trusted teacher. Please... can you help me? He's applying as a helper. That's interesting. She has nothing more to lose anyway. What is your strategy? Would you help me if I told you? But... what's the point of this? You can't trust me at this point? You'll use a helper chance? I have a plan. $2 million? It's already ours.
