 Mommy! Mommy! Are you sure this is it? Yes, this is the address in the email. This is it. No, it can't be. It's... Pepito, yes, it's me. Surprise! I lied. Come in, come in. I don't want my monsters to get all wet. Let's see. Come, let me warm you up. That's it. That's it.

 Of course, monsters don't get cold. Always warm. Are you thirsty? I warmed up the glasses. Take a seat. No! No! Not there! So, Pepito, what do you need from us? Why did you make us come dressed like this? Stay right there so I can look at you. So, tell me... Were you all in the same egg? You know what? You could sit on her. And wiggle a little like this for warmth. Like this... Ah... this is so embarrassing. We just realized you're a pervert.

 You called us because you're a pervert. - We have to go. - But, no... wait... - Goodnight, Pepito. - Hey! What kind of name is Renaldo anyways?! - Enough. - Where is your "y"?! Enough. Renaldo! Why did you get so mad at Pepito? As you know, my name is Renaldo. But the name should be Reynaldo. That's a real name. But when my mom named me, forgetful as she is, she forgot the "y", and I've been searching for it my whole life. In school, the kids made me feel like a monster because I was missing a part of myself, until I saw Bianca Nova's movie, The Woman with No Eye. Then I understood that missing a part of me made me unique. I had never seen you as a kid. I like your little shoes. How long have you been working on that speech? A long time. Andrés helped me punch it up. - You forgot the last part. - Which part? "The kids made you feel..." Ah yes, the kids made me feel like a monster, so I embraced my monstrosity through horror. Please help us welcome Mark Stevens! What's up, mi gente? Make some noise! And give it up for yourselves for coming out today. My God! Are you ready to change your life and finally take control of your future? - Yeah. - Yes! Now, before Hierbalite, I was a waiter, making minimum wage and begging for scraps. Today, I run my own business on my own terms, helping people lose, gain, or maintain weight. I'm my own boss, setting my own hours, and paying myself what I'm worth. Wanna be me? All you have to do is buy cases of our nutritional products and try to sell them to your friends and family while also cold calling a list of vulnerable people from a list of names that you buy from us and try to convince them to do the same. Look where I'm gonna live with my boyfriend! Tati... Have you met in person yet? No, we're exclusively chatting online, but I know what he looks like. Besides, absence makes the heart grow fonder. Of course. Wouldn't it be good if you met in person? Meet up with the love of my life... I've never thought of that. - What are you looking at? - Well, after the Pepito incident, I think we should try to find our own gigs instead of just taking any gig that comes to us. Look. "Mayor Teresa Lobos comes to the city," "hopes to save her beach town from lack of tourism." I think a little horror could help this town. Come on, why are you bringing Frutsi here? Because he's not my problem anymore. I'm moving out. I'm part of a multi-level marketing company now where I help people lose, gain, or maintain weight. No, no, no, I've heard of this. - It's a bad idea. - Look. No, no, no. Listen to me, Beatriz. A few years ago, I did what any young artist type would do... a cemetery photoshoot. Are you sure you got permission to do this? Yes, I already told you. If I sell these photos, it will be good for both of us. More. A little bit more. Come on. The leg, the leg... - and Úrsula... - Hey! Shit! Let's go, let's go! Get off my son's grave! Julio! Hey, don't leave me here! I'm going to sue you for everything you've got! Grave defiler! Get off there! People will always want to take advantage of you. Hierbalite is a pyramid scheme. A corporation that will steal your soul's last breath. Trust no one. Well, I can trust corporations because Mark Stevens would never do that. He's a successful man, and rich people don't lie. Let me tell you a bit about my town. Our economy depends on tourism, right? And we had a big attraction for many years: a little owl with a wig. But the wig got lost. Maybe it fell in the ocean because it was not well secured with a bobby pin. Every time I saw it, I'd say, "Please pin it down securely!" But I wasn't mayor then, you know? So, when I was running, I made a big campaign promise to find the wig. In fact, my slogan was, "We will find wig!" But I haven't had any luck. I came to the city today to visit wig shops in hopes of finding an identical wig, but no luck. I'm gonna have to return to my town empty-handed, you know? It's not pitted. Now, you said that you have some sort of solution. I don't have a wig for your owl, but I can make you a new tourist attraction. Imagine rumors of a sea monster... We missed you at the ribbon cutting ceremony. Juan Carlos tells us you've been distracted with spooky things lately. What could more important than family or chocolate? Am I even a part of this family, or am I just a beautiful orphan baby you couldn't resist bringing home? Of course you're a part of this family, my love. I'm sure he's very excited for me... I mean, him, to be a part of the family business. Right, my darling? How great to have a boyfriend who can always speak on my behalf. Well, we have some business matters to discuss regarding our new "Charlie Wonka" chocolates. We received a cease and desist letter. It says "Charlie Wonka" is copyright infringement. They're just jealous. It doesn't matter. We still have "Mickey Moose" and "Harvey Potter" chocolates. Úrsula? A sea monster? He's so distracted lately. You have no idea how happy we are that you're in his life. Yes, and Valdez Chocolates is so happy to have such a closely ally in Juan Carlos Cookies. I think it's time to secure this alliance. And now, it's time for everyone's favorite segment, "Ask Gregoria." First caller, you're on the line. Hi, Gregoria! Is Satan real? And have you ever been in love? Satan is real. In fact, he calls the studio every day and I hang up! And yes, of course, I'm in love, in love with my viewers. Next call. Hi, Gregoria! Where are you from? - I was discovered on the beach. - Sure, okay. But I mean, where are you from? - I was discovered on the beach. - But what about before the beach? I am Gregoria Santos from Mira Esto. Andrés! Can I get a minute? Give me your little hands and listen to my voice. I know we've been fighting lately. We've been growing apart, and I've been feeling tension and resentment. So... I spoke with your parents, and we came to a solution. We have to get married. What do you think? Will you marry me? Good. I'll take that as a yes. The wedding will be very long. The vows will be very serious with no jokes. There will be a photo booth with a big flash and silly hats and mustaches for the guests to have fun in a designated area. Isn't this wonderful, my love? You and I genuinely falling in love? Valdez Chocolates and Juan Carlos Cookies becoming one. It's too big for my little hand. Okay, then you're gonna have to make a little fist at all times. Andrés, we have to go. Can you talk later? Can you give us a minute? We're discussing love and business. Juan Carlos, I've always wanted to know, were you named after Juan Carlos Cookies or were the cookies named after you? Don't be stupid. Of course I was named after the cookies. Goodbye, my love. See you later! So, you're engaged now? I don't know. I'm thinking about it. I told him "maybe." Dude, you're wearing a ring. Did you say "yes" or "maybe"? I was very clear. I told him "maybe" with my eyes, like this... You can't keep making important decisions with your eyes. Don't marry him. Sooner or later, you'll find out something awful about him. Everyone is hiding something. Just look at Tati over there being catfished by some weirdo pretending to be a prince. Úrsula, Tati's right here. She doesn't listen unless I say, "Listen". Yes? We'll talk tomorrow night when we get back. Tomorrow? How far is this thing? The beach is four hours away. We're staying the night. Four hours? I told my boyfriend I'd meet him in 20 minutes. Tati, really? I explained it in the email. You're the only one who replied and said "received, thanks!" I received it, but I didn't read it. You should have told me. Tati, even if this was nearby, there's no way we'd be able to pick you up, pick up Úrsula, pick me up, arrive at the beach, set everything up, do the gig, and be back in 20 minutes for you to make your date. Well, I'll ask him to wait for me at the table. Do you think they sell jeans here? Let's make sure to use the bathroom before we go. You can put it on my tab. - No, that's okay. - I insist. Well, thank you. - You can leave my tab open. - Of course. There you go. Thank you so much. My friends are waiting for me. That's too bad. Until next time then. MISSING Tati, look at me. Okay, it looks good. - Can you breathe? - Yes. - Remember, you have to... - I have to wave, yes, I know. Wave, but don't scare the tourists. - Okay. - We want to attract tourists. Yeah, I'll go like this: - "Bang! Come to the town!" - No! No! Okay. "Come to town," yes, "bang," no. - Bang! - No, no, not bang. - Okay, here it is. Ready, Tati? - Yes. One, two, and... - So now I go into the water or... - Three! Careful, Tati! That way. That way. Tell her to go that way. Renaldo, play the sea monster sounds now. Goddamned Frutsi. Hey, look! Look, look, look. Come! Hi, monster. I'm gonna tell everyone I saw you. What do you think, Tico? So... ...we have to wear these... sorta vests that have sparkles on them... No. What is... ...almost like a remote control. Miss, are you okay? Do you have a ticket for your car? Why do you want to see my ticket? So I can get your keys to bring you your car. You're obsessed with the ticket. - Have you been drinking? - Yes. I can't let you get behind the wheel like this. I'm gonna call you a taxi. No. Where will my car sleep? I'll drive you. - So, did you enjoy the movie? - No! People don't know how to make movies anymore. That's too bad. What kind of movies do you like? I used to make movies. Beautiful, terrifying, guttural movies. They just bled out of me till they sucked me dry and tossed me aside. You make movies... What is your name? Oh, almost here. Slow down. - Here's fine. - Here? Are you sure? Have a good night, fella. My name's Bianca Nova. Wait, wait, no! Don't jump! And why not? Because... Look, then we have to call someone to... to come and pick up the body, and then... that person has to wake up in the middle of the night and drive all the way down here, and... There's nothing left for me here. I'm a has-been. I haven't worked in years. No one remembers my movies. That's not true. My nephew loves you. He and his friends. They're obsessed with your movies. You're a huge inspiration to them, and they're a horror group. What the hell is a horror group? Do they do makeup? They do makeup and prosthetics and things like that, and monsters, yeah. Bianca, Ms. Nova, you have to do another movie. Perhaps your nephew's horror group could assist. SEA MONSTER TOUR Alright then! - What's this? - Uhh... our payment. Vouchers for Camaroncitos. That place, look. CAMARONCITOS A JUMP FROM THE SEA TO YOUR PLATE When are we gonna come all the way here to eat at Camaroncitos? - Well... - Go get us cash. I mean, the vouchers are money. Yes, but the thing is, we live four hours away... That's not a problem because they never expire. Right, but my friends and I were thinking we could use money to pay for gas and... You know, Camaroncitos is the best restaurant. The menu has ceviches, chicken fingers, pizzas, hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries, all kinds of sandwiches, chicken with rice, chicken soup, there's a "lite" menu with a Caesar salad with big chunks of chicken. There's also Jell-O, cheesecake, and much more! You're very lucky to have those vouchers. - Yes, right? - Of course. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Well? - Well... She says Camaroncitos is the best restaurant because they have pizza, burgers, soups. There's a "lite" menu with chicken, chicken burgers, chicken sandwiches... Fine, fine. - It'll be the same amount each month. - Each month? You can't expect tourists to keep coming if the monster shows up just once. Ah, yes. Sure, of course. You bring the smile, I bring the teeth. Awesome. Let's go. Where's the chocolate prince? He said he needed to contemplate and went down to the beach. Andrés... Andrés! Dude, let's go! Tati has a date! I can't believe I'm running 23 hours late. - I'll go fast, Tati. - Thanks. Red cape, white collar... okay. Tati... Tati! I'm sorry, you must be looking for another Tati. No, no. It's me, from the chat room. But you don't look like your picture. The cartoon prince? I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. I know I'm not a cartoon prince, but you liked it so much, I just went with it. I didn't want you to be disappointed with the real me. You lied to me. All this time, you pretended to be someone else. It's not like that. I'm not a prince, but... I am a duke. - He's too handsome. - No, you know what you are? A liar! No, Tati, let's talk. Listen to me, please. Are you Duke Felipe of Spain?! Yes, yes, beautiful, but I can't talk now. - Tati, please, let's talk. - Duke Felipe! Can we take a picture? Sure, sure. Thanks. Tati, please, let's talk. Listen to me. I'm not gonna give you another second. - In fact, I missed work for this. - What? Work? My God... I'm a human Fitbit, and at this point, I have no idea how many steps my client has taken. - Tati, please, let's talk. - Maybe five... or ten... Alright, what stories do we have? A spider at a tattoo parlor is weaving a web that looks like the Virgin Mary, so people aren't getting tattooed there because they think the Virgin doesn't like it. I heard it, and now it's truth. I'll report it tomorrow. I heard about a sea monster at the beach in Montepio. We'll cover the spider story! Gregoria, did you hear that? The beach... The beach... Mommy! Mommy! Gregoria! Did you hear that? We'll cover the spider story. And you're fired. Frutsi, hold on. Uncle Tico! So, you won't believe what happened last night. Something pretty crazy. I met that director you were talking about. - The one that you like so much. - Bianca Nova? I told her all about you guys, and she said she's working on a project and maybe she'll hire you if you come to LA. That's incredible, Uncle. How did you meet her? What's she like? She's great. She's... healthy and normal... and levelheaded. No drama. She said she's working on a horror movie and if I know anyone who wants to work on it, please let her know. Wow, Uncle! That's incredible. I'm gonna call my friends. Thanks, Uncle. Bye. Did you hear that, Frutsi? Bianca Nova! Dear valued customer, if you would like to add minutes... Goddammit! As you can see, there's a dangerous cavity forming on the lower left canine. This one. Actually, Dr. Ricky, it's the upper right canine. You put the X-ray backwards. Úrsula, can I ask you something? - Who's the doctor here? - You are. And who's the low-level dental assistant? I don't have to take this from you. Really? What are you gonna do? Quit? You think you're gonna find another job that lets you wear flats and act like this? That's what I thought. I quit. Ugh, Pepito! Tati. Tati! Tati! - Welcome home, sister. - What's all this? After the breakup, I decided to focus on myself and my future. I've been lied to once, and I won't be lied to again. Beatriz told me about this amazing opportunity to make money from home helping people lose, gain, or maintain weight through the teaching of Mark Stevens. Where did all this stuff come from? I buy it from Hierbalite and resell it at a premium. - How much did this cost? - Two hundred thousand pesos. What?! I got the money through their lending program. They were so sweet helping me borrow the money. And thanks to their flexible lending terms, I don't have to pay it back till the end of the month. Cheers! Mm, tastes like cheesecake. - Juan Carlos... my love. - Everyone hates me! It was just a dream. Everyone loves me. - What's up? - I just remembered something. Remember when you proposed? I don't think I ever said no. I got in the car and was like, "Wait, I don't think that was clear." So, I'm telling you, now, at 6:00 a.m., before I forget: - No. - You're rejecting my proposal? I can't believe you're giving up all the work we put into this relationship just so that you have more time to scare people. Good luck finding another gay guy. Hello, Andrés.
