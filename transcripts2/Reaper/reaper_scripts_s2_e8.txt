 You know what? I'm thinking of getting rid of my cell phone. You're gonna go BlackBerry? No no, I'm gonna go old school... pager and pay phone. You selling dime bags out of your mom's car again? I'm just sick and tired of people being able to reach me whenever they want. You know, it's like, "I want to talk about blah blah blah. I have a medical emergency." I don't care. I just want to get off the grid for a while, crazy guy style. - I'll catch you guys back at the house. - Okay. What the hell? Where am I? Great. No no, this is just great.

 See, I was supposed to be getting a hot stone massage, but instead I'm with my buddy. Wonderful. The Devil brought us here, you idiot. Oh, idiot. Nice. Real mature, bro. You're short. Yeah, next to a weird Frankenstein monster like you. What are you, like 5'4", 5'5"? - Screw you. - All right, fellas. Take it easy. Just take it easy. Everybody just breathe. Yeah, would you look at that, huh? Makes me sick. All the CO2 spewing in the air polluting our planet, choking our beautiful Mother Earth. Did you know that global warming is the biggest threat facing us today? Really? You care about global warming?

 Yes I care, 'cause it can destroy our planet. And if that happens, that jackass upstairs can count all the casualties as innocents. That means I won't get any of the souls. Zero. So yeah, man, I've gone green. Dad, if you want me to start driving an electric car, you just say it. I'll do it. You know what I would really love is if one of you would step up and prove yourselves worthy of being my second in command. But I can see that's not possible. So since time is of the essence, we're going to have a little contest. Two vessels, one escaped soul. The first one of you who brings this guy back to me in hell will become my right-hand man... my human representative in this realm serving at my side as we create hell on earth. The loser however will be cast out. No financial support, no clothes, no car. Just an eternity of endless toil as one of my minions. Put quite simply, your life will be garbage. My life already is garbage. Well, then we'll just have to find a way to make it worse. Good luck, my sons. - Hey, I'm here to kick your ass. - What? I don't care what I have to do to win, but I am going to catch this soul. I deserve to be by Dad's side. I couldn't agree more. No no, seriously, I want you to win. I'll even help you if you want. I don't know what mind-games you're playing, but I'm not buying it. Oh, one more thing. Oh, what the hell, man?! Ass-whuppin' Morgan style. Believe. Jelly is jelly, whether it's grape or cherry. - But I don't like cherry. - I just... whoa whoa. Why is there a small Mexican lady in our kitchen? - It's my grandmother. - It's what? - Also, she's not Mexican. - What? You're... - Not Mexican either. - You're not? So what are you? What, are you black? Ethiopian? You're not Asian, I know that's out. Don't tell me, American Samoan. We've been friends for how long and you don't know I'm Puerto Rican? Benjamin, I don't see colors, all right? No, seriously, I don't. I'm red-green color blind. It's called dichromasy. It's very painful for me. So what it boils down to is that no, I can't ever be a jet fighter pilot, but yes, I can have a commercial fishing license. And that's good, but it's no jet fighter pilot. Look at all this junk food I found in the fridge. You eat all wrong. How you doing, Grandma? You remember Sock. No. Hey, good to see you too. I'm going to plant some veggies so you can eat like men. How do you expect to find a decent girl when you don't take care of yourself, Benjamin? Actually, Benjamin has a pretty hot thing going with a nice young lady named Nina. Uh, my personal shopper. Thank you, Sock. - Sure. - Nina's my personal shopper. She helps get me my hats, shoes, assorted men's wear. What did you say you were gonna plant back there, Grandma? Because I'm actually into eggplant myself. You know, maybe you could take a look at the garden and see if maybe we could make a nice eggplant plant. Maybe. Vamonos, Chico. Don't forget you have your cousin's confirmation party tomorrow night. I hate Hector, Grandma, but I will be there. What's up? You don't want Grandma to know you're dating Nina? The woman can see evil, Sock. See it. Remember how she knew Sam had something to do with the Devil? You don't think she'd figure out Nina's a demon? Yeah, probably. But maybe she'd be proud that her grandson is railing a hot demon. A demon who is way out of his league, I might add. She would disown me. That seems a bit much. But I do know how you Mexicans have a spicy temper. Okay, so we're all set. Congratulations. Welcome to the Work Bench team. Oh, and... this is for you. Thank you so much. This is such a blessing. And let me promise you I'm going to work my sack off. Okay. Okay. - Hey. - Hey. So I was thinking that maybe we could drive to the cemetery tomorrow and look for Alan. I'm working a double shift tomorrow. Oh, well, I'm giving you the day off. Oh, okay. - What? - No, it's just... I seriously doubt Alan's gonna help me get out of my deal. - He's too afraid of the Devil. - Oh. Well, it's worth a shot, right? Yeah yeah, I guess it is. Okay, well, I think we should pretend to be mourners. It's less conspicuous that way. And there's a funeral that we can hit up at 4:00. We're crashing a funeral? Yeah. Don't you want us to get back together? - I do. - Okay. Good. - Okay, so how are we gonna do this? - I think we should split up. Ben, why don't you take the funeral and you can keep a lookout from there? Me and Sock can pretend to be mourning at the gravesites and, I don't know, why don't you go back to the work shed? - Okay. - Uh, actually, Andi, - I think maybe I'd better handle the funeral. - Why? Well, it's gonna require some real acting and I just don't think you have the chops, Benji. I find you to be over the top. Hey, go big or go home, dawg. - What is wrong with him? - I don't know. So do you like funerals or... How did you know her? She was my high school English teacher. Same. God, what I wouldn't give to be sitting in her classroom one more time. You know, just reading and learning and reading. I don't know if it'll help, but me and some other students are having a candlelight vigil. You should come. Definitely. That'd be awesome. I mean, yeah yeah. Yes. That will be very sorrowful. Alan. Alan, hey, wait wait wait! Hold on, I just want to talk. There he is! It's okay. It was her time. She was only 46. Shh shh. Shut up. You know what I mean, right? A prayer from Psalms. For we know that neither death nor life nor angels nor any other creature... ...shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. - Uh... - What's going on? Nothing. Just boys being boys, right? Read the... read the Bible. Hey, sorry. That was a really powerful service. - How's it going? - He won't talk. Well, maybe he just needs a little bit of encouragement. Know where we are, Alan? At the track. Look familiar? We know you were a gambling addict, Alan. Yeah, and you're out of hell on a technicality, so if you sin once you'll be sent back immediately. Now if I remember correctly, gambling is a sin. - Uh-oh. - So here's the deal. You tell us how you got out of your deal with the Devil or we open this door and we leave you here. Now maybe you march on home to your little cemetery there and everything is hunky-dory. But maybe, just maybe, you take this fresh $100 bill I got right here and these racing forms, hop on in there and see how the ponies are running today, huh? Place a couple bets just like the good old days. Whiffaroo. Hey, guys, it's not cool. All right? - Just take me home. - You sure? 'Cause the races are gonna start any minute now. - Please, I'm serious. - They got slot machines and keno. Wait, guys. Guys, wait. Video poker, scratch offs, twin quin. - Okay, Sock, stop. - Hmm? Hmm? - Come on, Alan. - Oh, go go! Just let me bet this race. I need someone to bet $100 on the sixth horse to show. It's a lock. Someone help me out here. Why are you people ignoring me? Hey, guys, thanks for the impromptu torture session. - It's a great way to break up the day. - Sorry to bother you. If you just told us what we needed to know, we'd leave you alone. - Not possible. - Why not? Because if I talk to you, I'll be back on the Devil's radar. He's be trying to tempt me back to hell non-stop. Although going back to hell would be better than living cooped up in this little postage stamp. Must be tough. What choice do I have? Hi. I brought Vietnamese food. I thought maybe we could go watch a movie. Flying later. Yeah, great. Thanks. You going somewhere? You got on your going-out chain. Uh, yeah. I have to go to my little cousin's confirmation. And I was gonna invite you, sweetie, but everyone's gonna be speaking Spanish there. There'll be all these strange people to meet. I knew you'd hate it. Be wicked boring. No, that sounds like fun. I'd love to go. That's really sweet. Thank you. Really. But it's okay. Do you not want me there? I do. It's not that. It's my grandmother. She... sort of has the eye. The eye? She can see evil. And since you're a demon, I'm not sure she'd approve. Well, you're a grownup, Ben. Why can't you just stand up to her? Because she's scary. That lady does Pilates every day. Her core right here, the lady is rocking a sixer. Benjamin, vamonos. - Is that her? - I won't be long, okay? So just stay here, relax, watch some TV, do the dishes. And we'll talk about it later, all right? Okay. Okay, ya voy. What are you doing? What are you doing? You can't let her be bullying you. Besides, I'm like 90% not evil. That's less evil than most humans. She's gonna love me. Please don't do this. Don't do this. Don't. Hi, I'm Nina. So nice to meet you. Abuelita, Nina is a friend of mine. And she was thinking of coming to the party. That thing is not going to my party. You keep her away from me. Far away. Listen. Look at me. I'm sor... I'm sorry. I promise this whole thing will work itself out, okay? I'll call you when I get back. Ahem! Hey, man. Sorry I slapped you. It was wrong. Even if it was incredibly satisfying. So you still up for lending me a hand with this thing? Helping me win this? 'Cause I'm having a teeny bit of trouble. I can't believe this. All right, his name is Bud Brown. Pretty bad dude... adultery, theft, murder. Says he owned a chop shop by the piers. Have you checked that out? Not yet. - What about his apartment? - Huh? - Oh, I didn't read that far down. - What have you done? What, I'm here, aren't I? Huh. What is he building in there? I don't know. Hey, let me see your vessel. That one looks different than mine. I'm pretty sure they're the same. All right, so the Devil didn't say that the winner was the one who vesseled him, just the one who sends him back to hell. So I'm gonna go in there and capture him. Then I'll give you the vessel, you drop it off at the DMV and then, boom, you get the credit. Good plan, man. Hi. Uh, I was just wondering if you guys bought spare auto parts, 'cause I have an old car I no longer use and it's got some pretty good stuff. Get out. I don't think so, Bud. It's not working. Hey! Yeah, so you can get us in at 7:30, right? Okay, great, but will you just make sure I get a window seat? Last time I was in the middle of the restaurant I could just barely hear myself think. No no no, thank you very much. All right. See you tonight. Hey, you're alive. What the hell did you do to my vessel? I broke it. And I gave you a real fire extinguisher. What? Why? - I almost got killed in there! - I know. Just figured once you were gone this whole competition would get a lot easier. Are you an idiot? I don't know how I can be any more clear. I don't want to win! Sticking to your story. Nice. No, Morgan, you've got to believe me. Boring. Seriously, we didn't have any bigger gloves than that? Hey, where've you been? Dealing with Morgan and this stupid contest. I'm trying to let the idiot win and he won't let me. I wish I looked like Morgan. He's such a handsome gentleman. Yeah, he's got the perfect body for clothes. Like the way the suit hangs off his broad shoulders He's got a barrel chest and little narrow waist. And it's subtle, but if you look closely you can notice all the awesome muscle tone underneath. Okay, yes, he's great. He's also incredibly lazy. That's why I want to make sure he wins. If the Devil is stuck with him for all eternity, the whole world is a lot better off. What are you guys doing? We have an idea about how to convince Alan to tell you the secret. I appreciate the thought, but I think Alan's a lost cause. We got it. Alan's sick of being stuck at the cemetery, right? But he's got to be there because the ground is consecrated. What if we send him to a city where every inch of the ground is consecrated? Yeah, where he can actually have a real life. Where the Devil couldn't find him. All right, Alan, we've made a little film for you. It's a little rough still. It's a bit spotty in places. But it'll give you a good idea of how fun life is gonna be in Vatican City. 'Cause it is. It's gonna be off the chain. So what do you think? We can help you with plane tickets, a passport... everything. - And in return? - You help me. You tell me what you did to get out of your deal with the Devil. - Let's do this. - Yeah! - Serious? - Yeah. I can't live like this anymore. It's driving me crazy. Okay, I'm gonna leave this with you. But if this winds up on YouTube I will sue your ass. Have fun, all right? Let's go. Uh, have we started yet? Not yet. Here. No need, I brought my own. Sandalwood. It was her favorite. How are you holding up? Are you okay? - I'm doing okay. - Yeah? - You? - Oh, you know. Baby steps. Actually, I was thinking it might be good to do something kind of fun tonight. You know, shake it up, get out of my own head for a while. I could definitely go for that. Oh yeah? What do you say to a little round of bowling? Uh, or not. Just an idea, a leisure activity. No, it's not that. It's just, you know, she just loved bowling so much. Wouldn't really seem right. Of course, bowling. I know, what an idiot. I'm sorry. I can't believe I forgot that. When she rolled that 300 last year, she was so proud. Yeah, I know. The elusive 300. Man, the lady could roll. So... I brought a poem. I thought maybe I could read to the gang tonight. You should save that for Thursday night. - What's Thursday? - We're having a memorial service for her. Another one? This one's gonna be more intimate. Just her closest family and friends sharing their memories and stories one more time. - A final goodbye. - Oh, I don't know. Maybe we could go bowling after that. What time does it start? You see Grandma out there planting some healthy food? Don't tell her, but I'm gonna throw those veggies in the trash. Come on, Chico, let's go in the living room and wrestle. Yeah. Hi. Maybe this is a bad idea, but I like your grandson way too much just to let this go. I'm not evil. You're not seeing me for what I actually am... a fallen angel. While I may know what hell is, I've also seen the highest reaches of heaven. And I can tell you honestly, that's where I'd rather be. - Have you met St. Peter? - I have. What is he like? Oh God! When you're around him you just... you feel this incredible sense of calm. It's quite amazing. You're so lucky. Uh, Nina, you probably don't want to do that. Ben, it's okay. We're fine. We're just having a chat. Chico, no. Abuela! Oh my God. Abuela. Hey, how's your grandma? Minor heart attack. But she's doing fine. She's gonna be there a couple more days. Minor heart attack, huh? If I go out, I'm going out huge. Double heart attack. Left ventricle all over you. - Have you talked to Nina? - No. She flew off right after it happened. You know, I specifically asked her not to talk to my grandmother. I had it under control. Does she listen to me? Not at all. In all fairness, the chihuahua did attack her. I don't know what to do. What do you guys think about my pants? - Are those pinstripe? - Yeah, it's a very subtle stripe. But still noticeable. Well played. Thank you. Going to a memorial service tonight. Got to look good. You still chasing after that funeral chick? Persistent. I know. I'm gonna convince her she's done grieving tonight. Think it's safe to expect a little tongue action after this memorial. Maybe during, I don't know. We'll see, who knows? I'm gonna head back to the hospital. Thanks, friends. No problem, Benji. Always here for you, man. Ahem. Hi, I'm here to honor the deceased. Oh, of course. Please sign in. Mmm-hm. Were you one of Mrs. Simons' students? I was, yeah. But I like to think that I taught her as much as she taught me. Ah. Well, I must say her students certainly loved her. Please go in and have a seat. Okay. Hey. Hey, Sock. How are you holding up? I'm pretty good, you know? Tell you what happened. I woke up today and I said to myself out loud, "Sock, you are done mourning." - Really? - I did, really. I've grieved... just grieved so hard and for so long. I just want to move on. I want to embrace life. I want to make out with strangers, you know? We all should. - Yeah, you're right. - Yeah. We should put this death behind us and live. You got it. It's what Mrs. Simons would have wanted. Mrs. S. I am so happy I met you. You are an amazing man, Sock. I am, I know. This is Nate, my boyfriend. He's really been crushed by all this. Yeah. Your what? Sock was just talking me through my grief. And it helped. It really helped. - Maybe you could help Nate too. - Mmm. We all really need each other right now. We can pull through this. Okay, I'm out. Excuse me. Before we begin the remembrances I have a very important announcement. As you know, Mrs. Simons was a philanthropist as well as a teacher. So her dying wish was to bequeath her entire fortune to her students. So all of you students who attended today's special memorial will receive $10,000. You'll then be asked to donate that money to a charity of your choice, any worthy charity, as a way of honoring Mrs. Simons' memory. Thank you. And I'm back. Hi, do you have any direct flights to Vatican City? Rome's the closest? Yeah, Rome is good. No, it's for a friend. His name is Alan Townsend. Order up. He'll call you back. Sorry, you were being rude. And given the fact that the two of you let the soul go, I should think you'd be a bit more ashamed. You fellas ready to order? Hi, yes. I would love the chicken... He will have nothing. I'll have a cup of coffee... black, two sugars. Dad, allow me to apologize. You have any idea how disappointed I am in you two? I mean, to think that one day one of you might actually help me guide mankind on a path to destruction. It just simply boggles the mind. - Right, but, Dad, let me explain. - No, let me. You know what I see when I look at you, Morgan? Hmm? I see a big lazy puppy dog with big puppy dog eyes and a little puppy dog brain. So eager to please and yet so incapable. Thank you, dear. And you. Such a whiny little baby. Yeah. You won't be laughing tonight when that soul finishes what he's been working on. - What's that? - A portal. Allowing his buddies, a bunch of degenerate souls... my hard-earned souls by the way... to escape from hell. He needs to be caught. Now. Whenever you're ready. Is that really how he sees me? A big lazy puppy dog? Come on, be honest, man. You really care what he thinks? Yeah, he's my dad. Yeah, but he's the Devil. He's never gonna be a real dad. He can't. It's impossible. He's all I got. I just want to make him happy. You know, I've lived my entire life trying to measure up and then failing miserably. You know, you want to do him right? Let me help you win this, okay? Morgan, you have to believe me. I don't like working for him. I don't like knowing him. I don't want any part of this. - You being serious? - I promise. Okay. Okay, good. Let's do this. Sorry, Bud. We're gonna have to put an end to your experiment. Sorry, boys. You're too late. Hurry up, get him! Get him! Sam! The vessel's not working. Not on these two. The vessel will only work on him. Go! I'll keep these guys busy. Morgan, run! Get out of here! Sam, the vessel is gone. Hey! Thank you for saving my life. Bud, the soul... you sent him back to hell. - You won the contest. - What? No. No, l... l... I didn't do anything. You did everything. I just... I gave him a little push. There's no vessel, right? There's no way to prove which of us sent him back. Right? I guess you're right. You're a good liar. We'll just lie and tell the Devil you won. - There's no proof otherwise. - I could do that. I do like lying. Nice job. You sure you're cool, man? Just say you run a charity that helps with the community or something. Sock, I got this. I know a lot about charities. Oh, good. Good man. Good. Hello, Mr. Wysocki. Hello again. Oh, hello. And you are? This is my associate Ben. He runs a nonprofit- based organization that I am very very passionate about. I will be donating the money to him. What type of charity is that? He reads to the blind people and delivers food to hungry orphans on Christmas. Sock, please, allow me. While it is true that I'm involved in various community activities, the most important thing that I do is work in my laboratory. You see... how can I put this? I'm creating a machine that will help the entire world. An invention that will help liberate... mankind. Please, do tell. It's a straw. A self-sucking straw. And it will help people who have problems using their jaw enjoy the wonders of using a straw. There you go. Sir, I'd like to call this invention the Straw-to-matic. A self-sucking straw. Okay, sounds good to me. I just needed something to put on the form here. Straw-to-matic. Good. There's your money. All the best. Thanks for everything. And I'm sure somewhere up there Mrs. Simons is smiling. Yeah. Yeah, probably. - Good day to you, sir. - And you too. A self-sucking straw. How long have you been sitting on this gold mine, Benjamin? I guess I thought about it when I was eight. You thought about this when you were eight and you didn't tell anybody until now? Well, I told my mom and dad, but they didn't get it. 'Course not, they're idiots. Now listen to me. We're gonna take that 10 grand, use it as seed money to build something that's called a prototype. After that happens, ka-ching. What do you mean living expenses? He's talking to Alan. You want a full row of seats to yourself? You know how much that costs? No, that wasn't part of the deal. All right, whatever. I'll call you back. - What? - He has a list of new demands. He's afraid of being tempted so he wants to fly in an aisle all by himself. He wants money for a one-bedroom apartment. No no no, he can't do this. He says the deal's off unless I meet all of them. We're talking thousands of dollars. Ahem, would you excuse us for a moment? Be right back. - Walk normal. Walk normal. - Okay. Just walk normal. All right, what are we thinking? - Honestly, I'm torn. - I know, me too. I mean, on one hand we got Sam's soul, and yeah that is important, right? But on the other hand you got the Straw-to-matic. I mean, that's a straw that sucks on your lips, Benjamin. Sucks on your lips. It hurts my brain how amazing that idea is. - It's a once-in-a-lifetime idea. - It's lightning in a bottle You know what? It's not like Alan's going anywhere. But somebody could think of the Straw-to-matic and beat us to the punch. - All right, here's what we do. - Okay. We make our millions and then we help Sam deal with Alan. Why is there an envelope full of cash out here? - Huh? That is... - For you. We wanted it to be a surprise to help you with Alan. How'd you know about Alan? Do you want the money or not? Yes. Thank you. Ah, there he is. Congratulations, man. I knew you'd win the contest. I knew it. Even bet my secretary that you would. Now she owes me a diner at Houston's. No no, Morgan won. He pushed the soul through the portal. I had nothing to do with it. Oh, come on, Sammy. You think I don't know what goes down in my own house? Enjoy it, man. You're my second in command. What the hell is going on here? Well, we're celebrating Sammy's win. Very impressive. No, I keep telling him that I didn't win. You did. Hey, drop the false modesty, all right? We all know you wanted this from the very beginning. You screwed me? You've been playing me since the beginning? No. No, I wasn't. I wasn't... You don't have to explain anything to him. He's a nobody. He doesn't even deserve your attention. But don't you worry. Even though you lost you get a nice consolation prize: 10 bucks and a bus pass. Enjoy. Please, I'm not taking your pity prize. Oh really? Even after you find out that everything else is gone? Your keys, your wallet, your clothes, your car, your condo... everything? You looking for these, buddy? You're a dead man. Dead man. Oh, that guy, huh? Lots of bark, no bite. Wow. I can't believe it. This is actually happening. I'll call you guys when I get there. Whoa whoa. Isn't there something you want to tell us? Oh, right. - Right. - Okay. Well, what most people don't know about the Devil is that he can't resist a competition. Okay, so what does that mean exactly? You know that whole "Devil Went Down to Georgia" thing? He challenged the guy to a fiddling contest. He's so incredibly vain he doesn't think that anybody can beat him at anything. For me it was poker. So I have to beat him at poker? No, you do what you're good at. Figure out what that is and challenge him. However, there's one more step to get the Devil to agree to the challenge. - Okay, what's that? - I can't tell you that right now. - We had a deal. - Why? No. Look, until I'm safe standing on consecrated ground I have to keep one ace up my sleeve. I promise you I'll call you as soon as I step foot in the Vatican. You have to believe me. I want to help you. I just wish I could be there to see his face when you do beat the bastard. Call me the second you land. Do you believe him? Yeah. Yeah, I do. You? Yeah, I do. - Hey. - Hey. - For your grandma. - Oh, thanks. - How's she doing? - Better. Doctor said it should just be a couple more days and she could go home. Ben, I'm really sorry about what happened. Sometimes when I get started I just lose control. I know. It's fine. Let's just forget it and move on, all right? Okay. But we still have to figure this out. I mean, did you talk to her yet about us? I did. And it's handled, baby. Good. What happened? I told her that I dumped you. So now we can secretly date and see where that takes us. It's win-win. Are you kidding me? I don't have another choice here. What do you want me to do? I want you to go to the hospital right now and tell your grandmother you love me and you want us to be together. - You serious? - Why not? Well, for one thing, visiting hours are over. - I couldn't get in. - Ben, you could get in. I don't want to put her under that kind of stress. I mean, not in her condition. You told me she was feeling better. - She's in the ICU. - Our relationship is in the ICU. Ben, you're letting her bully you. And now you're bullying me. You're not giving me any choice. I just want you to be a man, - have a backbone. - Backbone? You want backbone? How about this? It's over. Ben, don't say that unless you mean it. I mean it. You broke my heart once and I forgave you. But not this time. This time you're gonna wish you never met me. Tough bid, my brother. She's amazing woman. I would kill that ass. Alan just texted me. His flight's about to take off. I can't believe this. I'm going to beat the Devil. I know. How does it feel? I feel like me again. Does that make any sense? Yeah, totally. I did it. I beat the Devil. I'm done. Whoo! - Whoo. - Sorry. I don't care. It feels good. So... what are you gonna do with your newfound freedom? I might learn a new language. - Really? - No, I'll probably just nap a lot. Okay. Thank you so much, though... - for sticking with me. - Of course. Okay, sorry. Sorry. I just had to do that. Yeah yeah, we just kissed a lot. And I want to do it again. Me too. But, uh, we should, uh... we should wait until tomorrow. I'll be out of my deal with the Devil and then we can kiss as much as we want. All right, that sounds like a plan. Thank you. Hi, this is your captain speaking. We just got word from the flight deck that we need to go ahead and make an unscheduled maintenance stop. We apologize for this inconvenience. But the good news is we'll be stopping in Las Vegas. You will each receive $100 in casino chips to tide you over while we're on the ground. So please enjoy your time in the gambling capital of the world. Can I get you something to drink?
