 Reaper (2007â€“2009): Season 2, Episode 4 - The Favorite - full transcript 
 Satan pairs a reluctant Sam with Morgan, another one of the Devil's offspring, to help capture an escaped soul who has a legion of gold-made beetles to do his bidding. However Sam and Morgan do not get along at all because of the soulless Morgan's antics. Meanwhile, Andi discovers that Sock is sub-contracting his Work Bench shifts to ex-manager Ted, who naturally takes advantage of his new job to further flirt and ogle women customers. Ben becomes uncertain over where his romance with the demon Nina will lead. Later, Sam finally learns that his father is not dead... but rather undead.

 I'm back with groceries. - Finally. I'm starving. - You get everything on the list? Of course. I got your special potatoes. Yes. Got your special soy pizza pouches. - Ah! - Ah, that's for me. What's in there? It's private. It's my private food. - Sock! - No secrets, Ben. Cherry tomatoes, sourdough rolls and peanuts.

 Why is that so private? 'Cause I don't want people to know what I eat all the time, okay? - Ah, got scratchers. - Nice, Ben. - Oh! - All righty. Okay, come on, Papa needs a new jetpack. Zip. Aw, I never win anything! I think I won $1000. What? - I won $1000! - We won. We won! Yeah! That's so weird. I paid for that ticket with my own money. This is so great. I wanted to take Andi away this weekend. - I'm gonna go cash it out right now. - What?

 - I hate that guy. - That's my money. - Hey hey! - Let me check this out, huh? Ah ha ha. My lucky day. This ought to be just enough. - Give that back. - Hey. You shouldn't be traveling with this much cash. It's financially imprudent. Live and learn. That is my money. And we're going to use it to bail Morgan out. Police station... hop to it. Who the hell is Morgan? That's right, the two of you have never met. Wait till you meet him. You're gonna love him. God. All I'm saying is you're kind of being a pill. Know what they say about money and evil and everything? Shut up, shut up. I think I hear our boy. Jeremy, if your wife doesn't like how late you're working, tell her your girlfriend doesn't mind at all. Morgan, you are a piece of work. I'm terrible. Hey, you came! Sorry about all this. Look at you. - How you holding up, kiddo? - Great great. They let me sleep in a back office. Couch was comfy. What did you do? I just accidentally stole a limo. You believe this guy? Hilarious. So can I go now? You must be Sam. It's good to meet you. You know me? Oh, hey, I'm being rude. Let me do it properly. This is Sam Oliver, bounty hunter extraordinaire. This is Morgan, my son. It's nice to meet you. Dad's told me terrific things about you. You're his son? One of the good ones. Like you yourself, Sammy. Hey, I guess that makes you two half-brothers. Yeah. Hey, we're having a good old-fashioned family reunion here, aren't we? Look at that. - Hey, you make a new schedule? - Yeah, my first one. I put you on deliveries all week. Perks of dating the boss. Thank you. Wanna come? I got a Laser Tag gift card. I can't. I got all this work to do. I hate this new job's already interfering with our lives. Andi, how often does my job with the Devil mess up our plans? I was gonna take you away this weekend with the 1000 bucks I won. You won $1000? Yeah, then the Devil took it to bail out his stupid son. The Devil has a son? Oh my God, that is so scary. Is it? - It's not that scary. - There are little Devils running around. That doesn't give you chills? You know, it's not chilling. He's pretty normal... pretty normal guy... considering. So yeah, I'm gonna go do deliveries. Oh, thank you very much. - What is Ted doing here? - I don't know. It's like he's still working. He was fired but he just can't stop. - It's so sad. - Tragic. Excuse me, ma'am. Hi, we've had reports of a pervert harassing women in the parking lot today. Real psycho, so be careful. - All right. - Okay. - Thank you. - Have a good day. I almost let it slip to Andi I'm the son of the Devil. - Ooh, not smart. - I wasn't thinking. I hate lying to her. You're old-fashioned that way. Here we go, here we go. Excuse me, I was wondering if could... Ohh! What are you... Ahh! I'm not! I'm not! What are you... I know, I know! - Happy? - Always. Hello, how are you? Ohh. Do many people find those women attractive? Oh yes, I think they're beautiful. So for you, beauty entails injecting silicone into your chest cavity? Okay, ladies, enough fashion talk. Poblano quesadilla. No, thank you. I have a class. Cool. If you're done with that, can I read that? - Sure. - Thank you. Hot. - Mmm. - Mm-hmm. This is delicious. I'm starting to like human food. How's demon food different? Usually it's still squirming... or screaming. Check it out! A sex- and-intimacy quiz. We should take it. We'll score through the roof. "Do you feel emotionally closer to your partner after sex, or mostly farther apart?" - Closer, obviously. - Thank you. - What's your answer? - I don't know, it's hard to say. Come on, don't be shy. It's just for fun. Okay, that's fine. We'll go to another one. "How would you rate your overall satisfaction with your lover in bed?" Again, I have to give you a 10. What's your answer? Be honest. I don't want to do this anymore. Are you... unhappy with me? - No. - But in that way... the sex way... are you unsatisfied? It's not you, Ben, really. You're amazing. I've just never... I've never really been that into sex. It's not that important to me, so don't even think about it, okay? We should talk about this. Do you think Morgan would like these? Why would I care what that guy likes? Oh, am I detecting a little sibling rivalry here? Don't worry, Sammy, there's no real competition. I'm always gonna like him a little better than I like you. Wow, that really hurts my feelings. Oh, still, you know, I just can't help feeling a little disappointed about the kid. Morgan is that perfect mix of relative morality and selfishness. But there's something missing, you know? Something that makes me think that... he maybe just doesn't want to help me rule the netherworld by my side. - Don't care. - You, on the other hand, are a conundrum. For all your whining and complaining and lack of fashion sense, you always get the job done. You want to do the right thing. I hate that about you. But I guess that's the quality that makes you so effective. Are you giving me a compliment? No, mostly I just hate that about you. It's so damn perplexing. If could just take the best parts of you and the best parts of Morgan and squish them all together, I'd have the perfect son. Oh... - Is he dead? - Yeah. Killed by your latest soul, Edmund Fitzgerald. Big-time shipping magnate from back in the day. Real weirdo if you ask me. Lot of wild rumors about the man... and how he died. What rumors? They say on his deathbed he ate his gold so no one else could have it. There was a ring in this shop that belonged to him. Now he's back to collect what's his. And he will kill anybody who gets in his way. I think Morgan is gonna like these a lot. I'm parked at the far end over there. You could probably carry this the rest of the way, right? What? I'm just saying you look pretty sturdy. Thick ankles. I gotta catch my breath. Hang on. Oh my God. Ohh. Hey, Ted, Ted! Over here! Right here! - Hey. - What do you want, Wysocki? How much money you make today, Ted? Four hours, about $6.50. But I think things'll pick up though. I have a proposition for you. - What? - This lovely, sturdy lady would like some help carrying this box to her car. If you carry it and she gives you the customary tip of $5, although classy people leave $10, I will gladly split it with you. Shouldn't he get the entire tip if he's doing all the work? That is a business decision that you shouldn't have any part of, ma'am. Okay? But to answer your question, I am subcontracting the job. Therefore we should split it. And it's heavy, so $15, probably the least you should pay. I'll do it. Bert, I thank you. All right, watch your back. Knees... it's heavy. He's got it. All right. Andi, hey, I need extra shifts. - What? - I need extra shifts. I'll do anything... clean the toilets, garbage duty, late night, early morning, double shifts... whatever you got, load me up. Let's party. - Who are you? - All right, look. I've recently come into some financial issues that may or may not be online-poker related. Okay? More importantly, I know you're short-handed. Socket wrench is here to fix all your problems, boss lady. I'm afraid. Me too, because I'm gonna go sick-house on this job. The work will be done. It'll be better than done. The work will be good. You seem quiet tonight. I've just had some stuff on my mind. Just been thinking about things. Oh, well, stop it. Oh, okay, sure. Oh no. What? What's wrong? I don't want to talk to a certain person over there. Who was that? That was Brad, a demon I used to date. We just had a short thing. Uh-huh. Okay. It was a totally superficial relationship. Nothing like what you and I have. Entirely physical. - That's all. - Physical. Yeah, that's it. - As in sex? - No. Well... what? I don't... sort of. 'Cause I thought you weren't that into sex, that it wasn't that important to you. It's not, I just mean that... I just mean Brad was really shallow. No, Nina. No. Spit that out. We are talking about this. Oh G... will you get outta here? Morgan got himself arrested again. I don't know how I'm gonna get through to that kid. I don't have any more money, so you can forget about me bailing him out. I don't need your money, Sam. I just wish some of your good qualities would rub off on Morgan. Okay. Can I use the bathroom now? Special delivery. The next item Fitzgerald wants to reacquire is an old portrait of himself. It's in the Asher Gallery downtown. The address is on the back of this. I suggest you grab that portrait tonight. If it stays there too long, Fitzgerald will show up and reclaim it and more people will die. Since when did you care if people get killed? I don't. Good call. In truth, I have a small favor to ask. And by favor, I mean you don't have a choice. So training the son of the Devil? That was never in the job description, Samuel. I can't believe you agreed to it. The Devil didn't exactly make it optional, man. This son of the Devil, does he look like you? Wait till you meet him. You'll hate him... super tool. Ooh, he's pretty. Looked dead even when he was alive. - Evening, bitches. - Hey, Morgan. This is Sock, Ben. Guys, Morgan... son of the Devil. Hey, it's good to meet you guys. You help out your buddy even though you don't have to. - You're good friends. - Yeah, we are good friends, so... thank you. Devil get you that car? No, would you believe an ex-girlfriend? I'm not one to kiss and tell, but did she have a title, and was it "Princess"? Yes. Some people probably like that car. I... also do. All right, we need to get our hands on that painting before the soul does. There's a burglar alarm sticker on the window, so obviously there's a burglar alarm. - Good one, Sam. - Okay, great. Which one of you guys is surveillance guy? The tech guy? Fighting guy? So what you're saying is you have no plan, no real skills? Yes, I would say yes to that. Good eye. Good eye. - We still get the job done. - No, you do, you do. I can't argue with results. Hold one sec. Right? You see? See what I'm talking about? He's a dick. Yeah. Think he'd let us drive that? I bet if we ask him he'd say yes. - You guys are jerks. - I bet you're right. - See the suit he's wearing? - Looks great on him. You don't buy that off the rack. What the hell are you doing?! In my experience, you guys got three or four minutes before the cops get here. You'd better grab your painting. I'm gonna go to a party. If it's raging, I'll text you. Sam, the painting, come on! Sam, come on. Sam Sam Sam! Fly, you fool! So you're gonna unpack all these sprinklers... all 500 of them? - Yup. - Then you're gonna restock the paint - and ship out the damages? - You know it. I'm having a really hard time believe you're gonna do any of this. That is because you've never seen me in hustle mode, Andi. It is "insani-tay." Thing about hustle mode is I need to be alone. I get sweaty. I take off my shirt. I'm a little bit shy. So you go for now, come back later and be amazed. Go go! All right. So to continue... ground rules. You do not work for the Bench anymore. You work for me. - I'm the judge, jury... - Executioner. Boss man, all right? I get the shifts, you do the actual work. If Andi comes along, what do you do? - Run. - Run! Attaboy. Got it. Mmm. You smell that? - No. - That is a Work Bench scent. Industrial rubber, turpentine. - Lawn fertilizer. - Eww. It is wonderful, and it's home. - Okay. - I thank you for this. You don't know how much this means to me. I will do anything you say. Just let me be here... in the Bench. - I like your attitude. - Thank you. A lot, okay? Don't do anything to mess up and make me have to can your ass. - Huh-uh. - I'm gonna take a nap. Wake me up in four hours. Four. Four hours. Don't tell me the other two clowns got killed. No no, they're fine. I'm not here on official business today. I have a matter of a personal nature to discuss with you. I need your help. Speak. Okay, so I'm sorta in a relationship... - with a demon. - Are you now? Never would've pegged you for a horn hag. Yeah, well, she's a great girl. Everything's going awesome... except for one thing. Spit it out, kid. I'm on break in five. Right, okay. My question is, can humans satisfy demons, or can only demons do that? Yes, humans and demons can get it on. All the time, in fact. Oh... I see. Are you trying to tell me you're having a little trouble in the bedroom department? No. No, actually, no. I'm doing a little research. Look, if you want to know how to please a demon, I can help you. - Seriously? - Uh-huh. - 'Cause that would be great. - Of course. Drop by my place tonight. I'll give you a one-on-one tutorial, as they say. I like to make learning fun, so bring along plenty of plastic garbage bags. I think... I think no. Thank you, no. It sounds like something I'm a little uncomfortable with, but thank you very much for the kind offer. Fine, figure it out for yourself then. No, Gladys, please. Is there any advice you can give me that doesn't require actual touching? I guess she finds you physically repulsive. Have a nice day. This guy gives me the creeps. How much longer do we have to hang onto this? We gotta figure out a way to lure Fitzgerald out into the open. I say we advertise this painting as for sale, he shows up to claim it and then we trap him. - Ehh. - Maybe Morgan has some ideas. - Yeah. - Morgan? Why would we ask Morgan? Dude seems to know how to get things done. All he did was almost get us arrested. Why do you love him so much? I don't know. He's just got this aura. He's the kinda guy that walks into a room and people's eyes go to him. He's got it. He does not have it. Some people do. It's like that undefinable presence. Like Clooney. - Pitt. - Rickles. Yeah. I used to have it, like four or five years ago. I remember that. That was a really good summer for you. I was really into kale at that time. - Yeah. - Yeah, all right. He's the son of the Devil. You can't trust him. - You're the son of the Devil. - Do you trust me? - Not really. - Wanna hand me that dish? Oh, what the hell, Sock?! I'm gonna kill you! - Sock! - Look look look! - The soul, he's here. - What? Where? Oh God, get it off! Sam, get it off! - Don't let 'em in your ears! - Ben, Ben! I can't vessel them! Bathroom, run! Eww eww eww! Aahh! It's on me! It's on me! - Shh! - Shut up. What are you all doing in the tub? Oh, we were playing a game of... hide and seek. You were It and you found us! - Good job! - Really? Oh, you! - Sam. - Huh? The painting, it's gone. He took it back. So sick. I had the creeps all last night. It sounds awful. Now we have no idea how to get this soul. That painting was our only lead. What's he doing with all his stuff? What do you mean? He must have hundreds of things... thousands, maybe. He's gotta have someplace to put it, right? That's a really good idea. Someplace big, like a warehouse. You said he was in shipping, right? Who is that? - I can see you. - Can't. I know it's you, Ted. Listen, you can't be here. You got fired. I know I did, Judas. Okay, why am I Judas? I don't know. Why are you? I didn't fire you, Ted. You got yourself fired. Look at you, Miss Fancypants, all drunk with power. You have to leave. Sorry, talk to the boss. - That's me. - Nope. My boss. Sock. - Sock! - Ahh! Shush shush shush. - No need to yell. - You cannot subcontract your job to Ted. I promised you the work would be done, and it is being done in a top-notch fashion. - What's the problem? - The problem is the company fired him! I know that. That's why he agreed to work for 40%. I get 60, finder's fee, everybody's happy. Do I look happy?! All right, listen to me. I will cut you in, but it needs to come out of Ted's end. - Get rid of him. - No, Andi... oh, brother. Listen, are you honestly gonna fire Ted again? He's already been fired. Should've stuck the first time. Okay, do you know he comes here all the time? Just to be in the Bench presence. He loves this stupid place. It's like his whole life, his whole identity. To take that away, that would just be cruel. I didn't do anything wrong. Plus, he's got other things in his life. No, Andi. Think about it. This is all he's ever known. This is the only job he's ever had. He eats here, he sleeps here, brings imaginary girlfriends here. If you force him to leave again, you will destroy him. We think we found where the soul's hiding his stuff. There's an old shipyard Fitzgerald used to own. It's been condemned for years. I'm on it. My shift's covered. So which one is Fitzgerald's? I guess we'll have to search them one by one. - What? - Hey, did you call Morgan? No. How did you find us? Hey, Dad wanted me to meet you here, said you could use my expertise. I guess Fitzgerald's keeping his loot in this old container. I don't believe this. He doesn't help me with anything! You just gotta learn to work the old man. He's actually a little bit of a pushover. Man. Wowee. I can't believe he was able to get his hands on all this. Right. Guy's got impeccable taste, I'll give him that. - Yeah. - Biedermeier... - Limoges. - Limoges, good stuff. Venetian crystal. - Huh. - Wow. This stuff is worth a fortune. Look at this. Fitzgerald made a list of everything he ever owned. Looks like he got it all. Well, except for "Mary Ann." Who's Mary Ann? Maybe this is her. You think she's still alive? We should find her before Fitzgerald does. - Yeah. - Yeah. Come on, let's go. This is Sock's fault. He put me in this position. Now if I fire Ted, he'll probably die or something. Yeah, but ask yourself, is that a bad thing? - I don't know what to do. - What is Morgan doing here? He's here? Wow, that's not what I thought he'd look like. - He's a jerk. Try not to kill him. - Okay. Hey hey, you ready to get cracking on that soul? We're trying to track down his wife. Until we do that we're pretty much stuck. Yeah, Mary Ann. I got her address. Dad hooked me up. Hi, Morgan. Hi, I'm Andi. - You're Sam's girlfriend? - Yeah. Okay, good to meet you. How are ya? - Heard a lot of good things about you. - Thanks. You're a lucky lady. This Sam, he's one in a million. Just brave and smart. He's just an all-around great guy. Thanks. Yeah, I agree. Okay. You ready to get going? Got a good feeling about this. - Don't say it. - I'm sorry, he's not that bad. I told you not to say it. Nina. - Nina? - Babe, I'm right here. - Yeah. - Hey, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I just heard humans can please demons in bed. Ben, I told you this wasn't a problem. Yes, it is! Sex is an essential component in a strong relationship. It is the cornerstone of... something, I don't know. I read it in some female books. What exactly are female books? I know what it is, all right? You can't be yourself sexually. You change into human form and pretend to be something you're not. I want you to be happy. So... I'm gonna have sex with you in your natural body. I would simply ask you be careful your wings don't poke me in the eye. Also please be aware my skin is very sensitive. It chafes easily. Also please don't talk while we're doing it, your demon voice is a little mannish. Okay? I'm gonna have a cocktail first. I hope you don't mind. Do you have a glass? So you want this? I could drink from the bottle. I don't know what I can tell you about my late husband. If you're looking to get your hands on his estate, you can forget about it. He made sure there was nothing left. Um, actually, we're here to warn you. I know this is gonna sound crazy. It's just that... Edmund Fitzgerald might be back from the dead and might be trying to kidnap you. I would've been a little more delicate about it, but yes, it's true. He had this list of everything he ever owned, everything he loved. You're the last thing on the list. Now I know you're a couple of crackpots. Edmund loved only things... possessions. Nothing else mattered. No, he did. Mary Ann was on his list. That's not me, that was his boat. The Mary Ann. She sank to the bottom of the Pacific 50 years ago. But if Edmund's ghost is looking for that, he'll never find it. Serves him right, the son of a bitch. I feel compelled to point out you're attacking the dead, and to say there's nothing really wrong with having an appreciation of the finer things... Actually, we were just leaving. Wait, you're wearing his ring. What? You're gonna get us killed! Fitzgerald is gonna come looking for that. He's not even gonna know it's missing. - We have to take it back right now. - No. I like it. You are such a dick. Now I understand why the Devil is disappointed in you. - You're a moron. - He said that? He said he was disappointed? You don't care about anybody but yourself. You do whatever you want and it doesn't matter who gets hurt. Why would I care when the world's full of guys like you... responsible and ethical? I don't feel that. Never felt it. In fact, I've never felt anything for anybody. It's very liberating. Do you really think I'm gonna kill myself for the family business? Not a chance. But you... you spill your blood. You work hard and you do a good job. When the time comes, I can stand on your shoulders... or dead body if necessary... in order to get to the top. You are evil. I'm the son of the Devil. What'd you expect? I'm done with this. I'm done with you. After today, no more training. I think dear old Dad has some serious quality time planned for us. I don't think you're gonna be done with me anytime soon. Do you hear that? Huh, my lucky day. - Morgan, wait wait! - Oh, what was that?! They're inside the vents. They're inside the vents. - Run. - What? Run! Sam, back here! Wait wait, I am not the one you're looking for. I swear! I'm not the one you're looking for! Whoa! I'm not the one you want. I swear. - Morgan! - Sam, back here! Just give him the ring, that's what he wants! It's stuck! The pool... jump in the pool. It worked. Yeah, I know. - Got it. - What're you doing? Why did you do that?! Wait wait wait! I'll give it back to you. It's yours. You want me to put it in your mouth? Please don't bite me. Happy? Good. We get to keep those, right? I can't keep running away from you. Or shoveling food into my mouth, for that matter. So I think I'm ready to tell you the truth now. The truth would be nice. So you know I used to be an angel. Yeah, I know. Demons were angels. But what I didn't tell you is that you're not my first human. Oh, I see. Before the fall, some angels came to Earth and married humans. There were even children born. They were called nephilim. - Wow. - I was one of those angels. I didn't have a kid or anything, but I did fall in love. When God found out, he banished us from paradise and smote those we loved. So the guy you loved died. Yeah. So if you're feeling like I'm holding back from you, you're right. I have been... holding back in a lot of ways... sexually and emotionally... because if I ever lost you the way I lost him... Nina... I can't tell you what's gonna happen in the future, but I can tell you I'm crazy about you. And I'm not going anywhere. Is that enough for now? I think it is. And... I think I'm ready to be with you completely... heart and body. And when you say body, you mean this one, right? Without the tail and horns? I'm just checking. I'm just checking. I made my decision. Ted, only official employees can work here at the Bench. So I cannot allow you to continue taking Sock's shifts. Didn't think you had it in you, Andi. So cold. That's why I called home office. They're letting me hire you back on a six-month-trial basis. Yes. You are a benevolent and gifted leader. On one condition... you'll be hired back as a trainee. Trainee? Little girl, I was working in this store when you were experimenting with alternative lifestyles at summer camp. Take it or leave it, Ted. - Fine. - One more thing... our new trainee is gonna need a trainer. Uh... I don't think so. - No. - Oh, I do. If you want to continue working here, you'll agree. Besides, I think you'll make a fantastic trainer... conscientious, dedicated. You guys are gonna be a team, joined at the hip for six months. Touch?, Andi. Touch?. Who's the pretty boy? Hi, I'm Morgan. Nice to meet you. He's sorta the son of your boss. So's Genghis Khan. You expect me to be impressed by a Gap ad? These also came... a bunch of gold coins. I'm not sure what to do with them. Not a vessel, not my problem. I can't believe you. And you say I'm selfish. I did all the work and saved I your life. We are not splitting this 50/50. We never would've found the soul if I wouldn't have lured him to us with the ring! So that was on purpose? That was all a trap? - That wasn't you being an idiot?! - You're a jackass. Listen to this, fighting like two brothers. I'm getting all misty. Look at you, huh? The hero. You captured your first soul. I'm just trying to make you proud. You could learn a thing or two from this guy, I think. Unbelievable. Let me see those gold coins, Sammy. Now, Morgan, Sam has made quite the investment in you by bailing you out of jail. And after your well-deserved R&R; at my villa in the Caymans, I want you to start thinking about how you're gonna repay him. What?! Why does he get the gold? You don't want that. That's blood money. People died for that, Sam. You don't mind a little blood on your hands, do you, Morgan? No, I prefer blood on my hands, Dad. Then it's settled. Hey, that's not a very happy Sammy face. He did nothing to capture that soul. I saved his life. Don't worry about it. I'm trying to give the kid a little confidence. Don't want to demoralize him his first time out. You demoralize me all the time. - You can take it. - Whatever. Sammy, look, I don't have to reward you with trinkets and paltry pieces of gold that some soul has vomited up. You're much bigger than that. You are. In fact, I'm beginning to reassess this whole situation. Maybe Morgan isn't the one I should be priming. - Maybe the perfect son is you. - No no. - I'm not. Seriously, put it outta your head. - Yes. I don't know. It's becoming clearer and clearer to me that you are the one who will be sitting at my right hand. Morgan can have that job. I don't want it. Don't you see? That's what makes you so perfect. Wow, I am so conflicted now. I don't know who to root for. Morgan. You could root for Morgan. Hey, do you mind making one last delivery? It's a big freezer. - Sure. - Okay, good, because it's going to your mom's place. What does she need a giant freezer for? I don't want you to be afraid. Hey, Sam. Dad?
