 Madam... The Hellsing membership was almost completely wiped out, we have nobody left, so I had to call upon some mercenaries to replenish our ranks. Mercenaries? Can we trust them? Afterall, the only thing that motivates them is money. Yes. These are not simple mercenaries, they are professionals! They Will remain loyal and hard-working, provided they are well paid. They call themselves "The Wild Geese". Are those fuckers trying to kill our troop?!

 I bet those assholes are into incest! They probabily all have twelve little sisters each! And they Fuck them hard! On Holidays they do them two at a time! Don't cry, don't scream, don't be idiots, and don't get depressed. Huh? We're just lost numbers. They really don't count us, they only use us. If we lose any men, we can just find more. There are lots of guys who'd kill for money. Captain, We're having trouble holding our ground. Is that all? You just need to take charge of the offensive! When the apocalypse happens...

 The angels are just gonna leave us... I think there'll be a place for us... Where, huh? Wherever it is, I hope it's not too sandy. Well, now you're done. There's nothing for you to see anymore. Captain Bernadotte, what's the job this time? Huh? Are we raidin' some London police station? Or are we catoring to some rich fucker? Who just wants his own army? Nah, it's nothin' like that. I'll tell you guys, but don't be surprized... This time, our job's gonna be killin' monsters. killing monsters ? Haha! Quit shittin' us! It's the truth! Your enemies will be Vampires, and Ghouls, which do not age. True Immortals! We splash holy water on the little demons, stab a crucafix through their hearts. Their unclean souls fall to ash around the cross. This is what we do! For further information, please read the Bram Stoker novel. Are you kidding?! There's no such a thing as a "Vampire". You don't know the truth. No! Actually, it's more accurate to say we never let you know the truth. A century ago, a secret group, the Hellsing Organization was formed. We've always worked out of the public eye, our whole goal is to keep one secret from the normal civilians... That Vampires exist! And if that is not enough to make you believe, then look at that!! This is one of the enemy, the Vampire! What? You're...a vampire? Ha-ha... Well... ...I suppose I am... I knew they were going to laugh... Alright, then give them a demonstration. Police Girl. Ro- Roger! How do you do? If this little mignonette is a vampire... ...then I'm Frankenstein's monster! Ca... Ca-Cap... Captain..!? She's a freak!!! Did you See what she just did?! She just flicked her finger and knocked me down!! You really are a vampire aren't you?! Of course she is... Though she is the lowliest kind of vampire.... She still is, indeed a real vampire. What a pitiful, cowardly little group of soldiers. They look utterly useless! So very sorry Madam... I tried to stop him. These are the men charged with protecting my master... ....so I came to see what kind of soldiers they were. Oh yes Madam... We received this letter A letter? From The Vatican's Section XII... Head of the Iscariot organization... Enrico Maxwell! What time is it, Walter? 3:00 P.M on the dot! Our host appears to be late. Could it be that we've fallen into yet another trap? I don't see any soldiers. Besides, they wouldn't attack in broad daylight. We do have home-field advantage afterall. This place is truly splendid! They have such a beautiful collection! That was the first time I've seen that painting. Really? Yes. My my, it seems we're late. It does appear so. Good afternoon, sorry for keeping you- Don't come any closer! What business does the Vatican have with us? Furthermore, how dare they send some little pissant as representation of their murderous group! Don't you think you are overreacting? Madam? You certainly don't make me feel very welcome... Allow me to introduce myself. I am the Leader of Iscariot... Enrico Maxwell. It's truly a pleasure to meet you! You don't need to introduce yourself! What do you want? Calm down, Calm down. No need to get upset... I didn't come here to fight. You expect me to believe that?! You blatantly violated our Treaty! You sent Agent Anderson to Badrick to attack us! And he killed two of my agents! I was almost killed as well! Don't try to tell me you didn't know! So what?! What do you mean "so what?"?! What makes you think you can walk all over us when we have a short little moment of peace? I don't care if we killed two Protestants or two million! We would never deal with Heretics like you, if we were not doing so under direct orders from the Vatican! So I sugest you just shut up and listen! You pathetic, Protestant Swine! "Swine"? The little Iscariots, I can hear your cries even miles away! It never changes! You always push your laws onto other countries. Rome really has changed little in two millenniums! Nosferatu Alucard. Hellsing's Trashman! Their famed assassin! This is the first time I've seen you in person. It's Nice to meet you, Alucard. It's nice to meet you too, Maxwell... And Good-bye! You come here and call my Master a swine... Don't think you'll be leaving here alive... Because I'm going to kill you where you stand you bastard! Oh, I'm scared, I'm scared! How could we possibly talk with such a scary bodyguard here For the last time, I'm telling you we Just want to talk, we wouldn't come if it weren't important. But, if this is what you want, I guess It can't be helped! Anderson! Thou shalt break them With a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed ye judges of the earth Server the LORD with fear...  and rejoice mith trembling Kiss the Son... lest he be angry, and ye perrish from the way,  when his wrath is kindled but a little Arise O Lord; what!? let not man prevail:  No! Anderson! Stop it! let the heathen be judged in thy sight I shall purify all in one rigteous sweep! Stand before me! I want to know! What are Iscariot? What are the Vatican? If We can't stop you heathens? Oh How I waited for this! Come on! It's about time we got to know each other better! Oh Judas Priest! This time will be quite different Vampire! Stop! Stop right now, Anderson! Yes Folks!! This is the gallery! Everyone, this way! This way, this way! Please, This way tourists!! ...Tourists... ...Everone... ...This way... I don't feel like fighting anymore... Yes, me either... I'm going back to sleep. I'm leaving now... I'm going back to Rome. This really is a wonderful Museum! I'd like to bring the children here sometime. Ah..So.. sounds good Next time I'll kill you... I'll definately Kill you... It looks like both of our subbordinates are quite troublesome. Don't you agree, you swine? Still angry are we? Fine! Call me what you will! Let's go somewhere else to talk. Ok, lets. Really nice save! Thank you very much! We already know about the attack on your headquarters, and that it was almost destroyed when the ghouls attacked. And all your hope lies in a message they left that you have been trying to decipher, but you're unable to. Amazing, and what else do you know? The message is... "Millenium", right?... We have a set of documents...their very existence is a well kept secret. The interesting thing is, they are all marked "Millenium". You want to know what it really is? Do you really want to know? Really? Really? "Please". This is "Millenium". This happened over 50 years ago. During World war II. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, a large number of Nazi officers began to flee the country. Many new German organizations began to form. The purpose of them was to help the Nazi war criminals escape. Most of them fled to different parts of South America. Then it is that, "Millenium". Yes... This "Millennium" that we both know about was a big project. It was created as a special operation by a Nazi Detachment. You'd probabily like to know how I know all that right? Yes! Their primary support... Came from the Vatican! From us! They've finally begun to understand.... "Millenium". "Begun to understand"? Oh they've barely scratched the surface! You're enjoying this, aren't you Herr-Kommandant? Oh yes I am enjoying this, very much enjoying it! Think about it! This was an important point! When next we see them, there's sure to be lot's of blood and death! It's wonderful! Perfect, truely perfect! Did you hear? Yeah, I did. Funny, I never thought it would be those Nazis... To Think we'd hear the names of people we thought dead 50 years ago... Heh, really... I've had a feeling about this for a while. This feeling of gloom is a feeling I've had before. Oh? Why? "Why?" You're asking me "Why"? There are only 3 reasons that the undead would be used in combat like this. One is you guys... One is them... And one is me... And the experemental unit of the undead they had 50 years ago was completely and thoroughly obliterated. You and I killed them all, remember? Yes, that's right... You're right, I remember now. Aging really is a terrible thing, isn't it? Aging is somthing we truly enjoy. We John Bulls that is. Alucard... Don't take this lightly. They picked a fight with us out in the open. We aren't so kind as to let them run rampant. This is why there are so fewer John Bulls these days... Because most are like that. There's no use of being well off without pride. Alucard. Has Walter explained your mission? Nope. There's only one order: "Search and Destroy"! Over. Understood, my Master. I didn't know vampires drank wine, or that they even could! Vampires are a complete mystery to me. Anyway, I wonder how she's doing down there? Someone let me out please... Someone save me!! I'm the one who reserved the suite. Yes. You're Mr. J.H. Blenner, correct? Youre reservation is here You have the Suite on the top floor, Sir. This way, This Way! We're the Suite on the top floor. Roger... Hey! Over here! He says top floor! M..Mister... Customer Sir... S..sir..that... that luggage... It's far too large for you to bring into this hotel. I'm going to have to ask that you... There is no problem. Ohhh... But... Uum... no I can't allow that... For a..a.. Piece of luggage that big... it's too... There... is no problem. There... is no... problem... There is... no problem. There is... no problem at all. Let's go, hurry up and bring it up. What the hell did he do? Magic? Or maybe some kind of Sex-Beam? Huh? How big is this Room?! It looks almost 30 meters to me!! This isn't fair!! I'm stuck in some shitty little hotel in the city!! How unfair is this!! George Bull!! Joanne Bull!! Sometimes, being in a cheap hotel is better. Is that so? This is Red Glove calling White Sock. The "Customer" is in. I repeat "The Customer is in". Anyway, tomorrow we start our investigation. I'll come pick you guys up sometime tomorrow night. Night is the best time right? For you vampires. You should be looking forward to it more. It's looking more and more like it'll be fun here! I see... So that's how it is. We're stuck in the same situation as our enemies. It's going to be hard for you guys. Dealing with this. Making you do all of this... To make ammends for the mistake done some 50 years ago... Don't concern yourself with this any longer Your Eminence. Iscariot is at your disposal, use us as you wish... We shall have the sinners kill themselves. We'll even have them digging their own graves, and holding their own funerals. Hey Seras, wake up girl. Seras... Who are...you? I am your gun. The Spirit of the Harkonnen Nooooooooo!! Don't run! Don't run away, don't pull away! I'm here to tell you to do your best today! I just want to cheer you on! This spirit is here to help you, so ask me anything you want! Then Honorable Spirit, there is something I want to know... My Life is filled with trouble after trouble... Is it my destiny to never be happy? Uugh..... Yeah...... Wait Seras!! I was just kidding! Kidding, kidding! I'm really here to tell you that this isn't the time to be asleep. Something dangerous is headed your way right now. Huh? What're you saying? It's coming Danger... It's Really Coming! Wake up... Goo... Good morning... Get up! It's getting good, so get up quick! Huh? The lights? Helicopter? Wh..wh..what?! This is Julio Edwards of NKT Brazil. What? What? Live from outside Hotel "Rio" in Rio de Janero. What the hell's going on? Approximately 30 minutes ago, a pair of suspected terrorists, a man and a woman... Began to kill employess and guests in the top floor of the Hotel They currently Hold 10 Hosteges, and are holding their ground. Yes. Yes, that's what they're doing. They're sending soldiers into the bulding right now. Yes. I doubt something like that is going to happen. If you want your damn war so much... I'll give you your damn war! More nfomation on the Terrorist Actions in Hotel "Rio". Dance, dance you freaks! Make me see hell! It's time for the war! The snipers have taken position.

The hallway is secure! It seems the Police are planning to attack... What do you think Alucard will do to them? He sees those men as nothing more then a stepping block. If someone comes to fight him well, im positive you already know what he'll do. Even if they're human? He would do that, even to humans? I believe you're forgetting Madam. He is a true as day monster! The rear squad's preparations are complete! Diero unit is ready! Rush rush! Roger, commencing entry! Dogs... I see, you do have a great deal of power. But... A dog could never kill me. The ones who Kill monsters are always human! It won't open... You damn monster! I get that a lot... But what does that make you? A Man? A Dog? Or a Monster!? Ma- Master. Seras, we're leaving. Um... What's Wrong? Hurry up! Master... They were... humans... So what? They're humans! What does it matter Draculina?! Does it matter if the ones who shoot us and start a war with us are human or not human? They came here on their own!! They came to fight us, they came to kill us, or to be beaten, and be killed themselves! That is all! That's everything! Thats something that can't be changed Nobody can change it! Not God, not the Devil, and not you! But... I... No, That's all... That's all there is... Master... Let's go Seras! In spite of your fear... Follow me into the darkness, as far as you can. Master... Yes! A call from the special line? Could it be?... Who is it? It's your humble servant Integra. Give me an order my Master! What did you do to them? I killed them. I completely destroyed them. I didn't leave even One alive. Now Integra. Give me an Order! They're probabily controlling the Police. The very same ones that were ordered to attack me... The ones that I killed... And the one's I will keep killing! They're only regular humans! I can kill them! Without hesitating or regretting for even a moment! I can, because I am a monster! But what about You Integra? I'm the one who holds the gun... I take aim... I load the magazine, and cock the slide... I am the one who releases the safety. But. You are really what kills them. So what will you do?! Give me my order! Sir Hellsing! Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing!! Don't mess with me, Servant!! I gave you my order already!! It hasn't Changed!! Search and Destroy!! Search and Destroy!!

I'm just a simple butlter My Master is sitting right here. I believe now is a good time to make some tea... We've gotten some high quality Ceylon leaves I'm sure you'll enjoy. This is the top-floor unit!! Help us! Save us please!! He's a damn monster!! Damnit!! Headquarters, Headquarters! Oh shit... Damn it! This is hell! Damn, damn!! It ended up this way after all... This isn't how it ends. They will die, more of them will die!! That guy won't just end it here... Now what will happen? It matters not how many of those soldiers get Killed, but going like this, we'll go nowhere... Even worse, it's not Fun! A squirtgun won't do a thing against a raging inferno! Alert Tubalcain Alhambra! He is to attack!! He may use any means necessary! Retreat! Retreat! Hurry up, hurry! We're coming, run! He's coming! Close it! Hurry Up! You asshole!!

What the hell is that? Film it! What a beautiful war declaration! This makes me happy! This is war! There's going to be another war! Look at that! It's so horrendously evil it makes me shake with excitement! That's what we're trying to get! To dance on the line between Life and Death! Right on the bridge between being sane and being completely mad! He's as lively as ever! This unhuman calls us!! He calls from the darkness! That Undead man... Our Undead friend... That Vampire! I can hear the Nostalgia... That beautiful symphony! Along with its chous of painful screams! My oh my, if that wasn't a wonderful meal! It is what I'd expect though... From the famed Alucard... My name is... Tulbacain Alhambra But my friends have seen fit... To call me a "Dandy Man". So you're the one who sent me those pitiful souls? Those poor pathetic men? Those men are there, because their superiors wanted something more than anything... That, of course is Eternal Life What completely hopeless fools.. There's no such thing as "Eternal" in this world. Though fools, they were of some use to me... How many of your precious silver bullets do you have left? Alucard? Enough boasting, what happens now? "Dandy Man"? I intend to take your life! The time is neigh for you... To become nothing more than one of our samples... For Millennium! Of course, of course. What a completely hopeless lot... It was you people afterall. That means it's only natural for me to end up fighting you. You must not have learned anything... By only being killed once. Oh come on... You won't escape! The vampire Alucard is nothing! Tubalcain has started fighting! You're kidding!! If something happens to him, what about our deal? Relax, he'll- Maybe they should start paying me more... Oh well, time to find a chopper.

To go back to your true home... Back to Hell? What's so Funny? I'm so very happy! To think that fearsome fools like you still exist! Millennium?! Last Batallion?! I see. So it is that Kampf Gruppe of Unhumans, run by that insane Major... Even now, the world is still brimming with madness! Come! Sing, dance! Alhambra! And Squeal like a Pig! Squeal Like a pig?
