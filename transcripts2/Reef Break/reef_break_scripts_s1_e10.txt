 Previously on "Reef Break"... The Governor would like to put you on a retainer. I hear you're some kind of fancy fixer for the Governor now. Doing for him like you used to do for me. I just saw Doug O'Casey. -What is this? -It's only Adderall. They sell it in school like Skittles. Are you dealing? I can take care of myself. Are you okay being here alone with me instead of with Ana?

 There's still something there. Jake: Something's still there. But I'm exactly where I want to be. Let's tell the world that we're together. You're drunk. I'm happy. We're doing pretty well with our own little secret. Meet Kristy Ellis, Reef PD's one-woman intel department. It's her again. You have my, um... You have my full attention. I can tell. You've been avoiding me. Our little rendezvous was really hot.

 But, you know, that's all it was. I'm here 'cause I want to be with you. Would it hurt to have an adult conversation every now and again?

It's 3:00 a.m. Cat: What are you doing? I'm reading, uh, Thucydides' "The History of the Peloponnesian Wars." Oh. Well, that sounds... boring. On the contrary. The conflict between Athens and Sparta could not be more dynamically rendered. How about the dynamic between you and me and a bottle of 10-year-old bourbon? You're on the prowl again. You can never sleep after a caper. Let me in, and I'll tell you all about it. Well -- Well, it's late. How far away are you? About 10 feet.

So, uh, was it -- was it that night that you got me? ♪♪ I remember everything about that night with absolute clarity. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Are we really gonna do this? Oh, come on. It's been in the air since you got back on the Reef. Yeah. You don't have to... I don't think you sh... Are you gonna answer that for real? Oh, my God. Hi, Ana. Uh, uh, you're looking for Cat now? No. Uh, no. Uh, uh, I-I haven't seen her all night. Uh, is everything... Yeah? Okay, okay. You too. Saved by the bell. Yeah. Whatever it is that you can't talk to me about, she seems very anxious about it. I got to go. What? I got to go. Ah. Yeah. ♪ Got into a fight ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Well, I feel so broke up ♪ ♪ Want to go... ♪ ♪♪ Nice and sharp? You can read all the numbers? Yes, I can. You didn't make any copies, correct? Copies are extra. Let me ask you something. What is so important that you need illegally obtained photographs of a land-trust deed, anyway? Next to Carter Eastland, Thomas Freeman is the largest landholder on the Reef. He's proposing to donate a large portion of that land to become Freeman Park in exchange for an extensive tax deduction. Mm. But if his proposal is based on a phony appraisal, he's cheating the people with one hand while gifting them with the other. We can't have that. So -- Your quid pro quo... Yep. ...keys to the Governor's Lodge on Wood Mountain with unimpeded views of the volcano. Yours all weekend. Yes! And what about my money? It's been transferred to your account. Excellent. Nice doing business with you.

Here you go. Enjoy. ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪♪ Buy a cold drink from you? Why? They refuse you service across the street? I support independent entrepreneurs. I may be young, but I'm not stupid. Whatever your hustle is, take it somewhere else. What are you moving, Adderall? Yeah, SATs this Saturday. Those kids need to concentrate. They don't have rich parents who can bribe them into fancy colleges. Look at you, the little Social Justice Warrior, leveling the playing field one dose at a time. Are you done having fun at my expense? Just starting -- I hope. We're always looking for fresh blood. And we'll clear 10 times this by lunchtime. I'm Luke, by the way. Yeah, I know who you are. Think you're ready, just walk across the street. ♪♪ He called himself Luke? Yep. Hangs out on Bay Street? Mm-hmm. Stay away from him. You always say that. And you never listen. I'm not a kid anymore. Bye, Otter. You notice how the whole world wishes they were a kid, except kids like you?! ♪♪ Morning. ♪♪ Cup of coffee? Uh, sure. Hey, I hear there's a big raid planned for tonight at the Island Club. Two sugars, no cream? Yeah, thanks. So... there's a C.I. involved. Squeezed out of his nightclub by what's left of the O'Casey family. This detail, it's a mix of squads -- Detective, Vice, Tech. It requires a lot of coordination, and TJ needs a Detective-level supervisor with her on this. So Tolan gets to take the door with you, and I'm stuck here holding TJ's hand? This isn't personal in any way, shape, or form. I want to make that clear. And if you left me off the detail entirely, it might look that way. Thanks for understanding. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ So, "Luke"... what's the deal? A week's pay for 15 minutes' work. How does that sound, Warrior Girl? ♪♪ Aah! Hey! Get out of the way! Yo, Tony Hawk! Move your ass! ♪♪ -Yo! -Come on. Get up. Move. Come on! Pick her up and move her yourself if you have to. Yo! Man: Don't move! Yo, yo! Chill, chill! Aah! ♪♪ No, you can't go! Aah! You got no idea what you just did. Put her in the car. ♪♪ ♪♪ Hello? Hey, Cat. It's Regina. Remember me? Uh, Regina O'Casey? Doug's little sister? Yeah, I remember you. It's been a minute, huh? Want to say hi to your little pal Petra? Petra's with you? Uh, you know what, Regina? I don't really want to say hi to Petra. We're -- We're taking a break from each other for a while. Ugh. That's bad timing, Cat, because she helped steal something of mine, and if you don't get it back, let's just say I can't guarantee the kid's safety. ♪♪ Ana: Uh... You continue to be full of surprises. We had a Thai housekeeper when I was growing up. I learned a few words from her. My parents disapproved, so, naturally, I persisted. Ah. Well, without your persistence, we would not be opening the largest new public park on the Reef in 50 years. Thanks to the generosity of the Freeman family and Foundation. ♪ Two, no one really likes ♪ Oh, I just -- I got this codicil, or whatever word the tax guys use. It's Greek to me, but, apparently, they wanted to make some small amendments to that side of things. Now? The official announcement to the media is at 4:00. I presumed this luncheon was some sort of celebration. The truth is, Thomas, the Freeman fortune was built by illegally under-appraising your entire inventory, cheating the Reef out of tens of millions of dollars in revenue. Now you've overinflated the appraisal on this donation by some 400%, according to my people. I must say, uh -- The Reef taxpayers are not gonna foot the bill for your personal extravagance. ♪♪ Sign over the deed, and we'll work something out to keep you afloat. ♪♪ Do try these noodles. They are divine. ♪♪ Jake: It's Jake. Do me a favor. Don't leave a message. Hey, Jake, it's Cat. So, uh...I'm heading out of town for a couple days to the mountains, you know, to clear my head, and I... I thought maybe you'd like to come with me, see the volcano, you know? Call me back if you get this. Bye. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Who are they? Just tell me who they are and how I can retrieve my merchandise, then I'll let you get out of here in one piece. What do you say? You'd do that for me? Call me sentimental. I remember you now. Always trying to act tough and impress Doug, but he never paid attention. Oh! Is that tough enough for you? Take her downstairs to the basement. If Cat doesn't show up by midnight, then Miss Thing here turns into a pumpkin. Otter: Hey, you've called Otter. I'm not here. Bye. Hey, Otter. God, doesn't anyone answer their phone anymore? It's Cat. Listen, I'm heading out of town. I need you to do me a favor. Have Doug O'Casey call me, alright? ♪♪ Wyatt: Hey, TJ. How's it going? So far, so good. I'm establishing the live feeds to the Island Club. We'll be ready for the raid tonight. You draw short straw or something? Aw, well, Sergeant Ellis thought you needed some adult supervision. What happened between you and Kristy? I was shipping you guys hard. You were what, now? Buddy cops. Or something more? Okay. Riding together or grabbing a coffee, all "tête-à-tête" over there. TJ, Sergeant Ellis and I have a professional relationship. All goes well, they kick in the doors at the Island Club tonight. So... coffee with Sergeant Ellis tomorrow? ♪♪ You know how to help yourself, right? Spill your guts. Then we can both get out of this dump. Yo, junior, it's your friends or you. They're not my friends. Why'd you do it, then? I mean, what'd they promise before they ditched you? Who said they promised me anything? Well, if you did it for nothing, then you're dumber than you look. Maybe I did it to get Regina's attention. What, by getting caught? Wow. You're funny. Yeah, keep laughing. I'll have your job by closing time. ♪♪ ♪♪ Aah! Petra! ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hey, Red. Hello, stranger. How you doing? I'm good. Hey, you got mineral oil? Aisle 1, by the tissues. Right here. You know, you keep moving everything, Red. I got to keep busy. Alright. And... Ah. Wow. That's a lot of peppers. Yeah. So... nice Italian sub for lunch with a side order of tear gas? Yeah, well, Otter called me. We're gonna take care of some guys with something spicy. You want a bag for those? Uh, well, if you throw in the basket, I'll pay cash. You got it. Yay! ♪♪ I'm nervous. I hate talking to the media. Thomas. You're giving the people a beautiful park. No one will care if you stumble on a line or two of your announcement. Well, thank you. I... Excuse me. Jake. Hi. Um, listen, I can't... I can't really talk right now, but I just wanted to make sure you're okay. Never better. Is that right? Hey, I didn't see your message -- m-messages. My phone must've ran out of batteries. You sound like you've been drinking again. Hey, it's happy hour somewhere. This is about Cat. Isn't it? Why would you even say that? Because last night when I called, I heard it in your voice. -It's time. -I have to go. ♪♪ Otter: Let's see what you got. Luke: Names, dates, CVVs. Every one checks out. Go ahead and run one. ♪♪ How many? Every card's solid gold -- or platinum, right? Where did these come from? What do you care? Your job is to sell it, not smell it. Regina O'Casey runs credit cards on the Reef. So? Let's just say it fell off a truck, and we're too smart to spit fortune in the eye. Well, if that's the case, lucky for you I already have a buyer to take this off your hands. How much? You'll be blown away by her offer. ♪♪ -Aah! -Aah! Aah! Aah! You screwed over Petra! Otter, show these boys what happens when you mess with our girl. ♪♪ You want one? No. Or some food? I-I could get you a sandwich from the kitchen or something. It's 'cause you're young, right? That's why you get the crap details. You know, I-I see you trying so hard to be bad. I remember what it was like at your age. Yeah, well, when I'm your age, I won't be the loser who gets stuck in the basement. Well, at the rate you're going, you'll never be my age. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Jake: It's Jake. Do me a favor. Don't leave a message. Jake, where are you? It's me again. Listen, change in plans. I'm not going to the volcano. I'm at the Island Club, and I need your help. Call me back. Jake. Sorry. Wrong number. Doug O'Casey. I see you got my message. It made my day. You know, one call from you to your sister could end all of this. My sister? She's a pain in the ass. Why did you bother calling me if you're not gonna help me, hmm? Well...here I am lying in my lonely cell, surrounded by foul-smelling, noisy man. Take me away from here, Cat. I need to relax before I can figure out how to help you. What am I, a phone-sex operator? I'm a little busy right now. Yeah, well, I've got all the time in the world. Yeah? Well, thanks to your sister, I don't. ♪♪ Thank you, Governor. Yes, I-I think it's a very good deal for us and the taxpayers. Thank you, sir. That means a lot. Okay. Hey, Thomas. Yeah, I'm just outside now. I can't wait either. Okay. Stay close, Eddie. One drink, and I'm out. ♪♪ Whoa. Hey, it's Cat Chambers. Tell Regina I'm here. Hey, look at this. Why is Cat Chambers at the Island Club? What is she doing here? Do our guys know she's in the building? I don't...think so. Were the cards delivered? As soon as I get confirmation from our man inside. Why is she here? No idea. Find out -- now. On it. ♪♪ Regina. Long time, no see. Regina: Good. You've got my package. Give it to him. Sure. You look good, Regina. Oops. Dish towels? Oh, you trying to play me. Why can't you ever make anything nice and easy? Did you really think I was gonna walk in here and just hand over the goods, give up my leverage? I want you to bring Petra in here, let me see her, and then you can have your cards back, okay? I actually have a better idea. ♪♪ Kill her now. Oh, come on. You know me better than that. I know a bluff when I see one. Your brother, Doug, would never let you touch a hair on Petra's head. It's always Doug. People throw his name at me like a knife, but I pay the bills here now. The good news is you'll be right down the street from him at the women's maximum-security prison if you're dumb enough to kill a minor over 50 grand worth of credit cards. I mean, come on, Regina. This is small time. So when I see my brother, I'll be asking for his forgiveness, not his permission, if I don't get my freaking cards back. Okay. Bring Petra in here. I'll make my call. I'll get you your cards. That simple. Alright? Bring her in here. I need to go to the bathroom. There's no way you're leaving this room until she says so. Are you serious? You're gonna make me go right here? ♪♪ Don't do anything stupid and make me beat your ass. ♪♪ Over there. What, in a bucket?

No, I won't stop. You know why? Because I care that you make choices that are smart. I don't want you doing something you can never escape from. It's not a choice. It's who I am. You're 17 years old.

Whatever you think's going on here, it does not justify you being out of protocol. There were people with guns and bad intentions at that club. Cutting the juice maybe saved lives. Maybe.
