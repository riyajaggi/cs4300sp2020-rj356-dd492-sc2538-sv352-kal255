I thought I brought 'em with me. - See ya. Nice being home. - See ya. Take care. Bye. Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, hey, Alec? - Hi. - Hi. - Uh... - Waiter gave me those. Thanks. - Hi. - Hello. This is, uh, Christine Tackett. Uh, Cal Lightman. I work with Alec's wife. - You're State Department? - No, no. Just a friend. Uh... Okay. Well, it's nice to meet you. - And you too. - Thanks. - Might wanna invest in a spare pair. - Yeah. [Cell Phone Chimes] Those cops are criminals! They shot that boy in cold blood! - They need to be charged! - [Yelling, Shouting] Are we gonna let these police kill our young men? [All Shouting] No! Are we gonna let these cops kill our young men? [All Chanting] No! No! No! No! - [Chanting Continues] - Hey. - Hey. - I didn't realize we had a night shift. - This about the kid who got shot? - Dr. Lightman. I'm Corey Strong. I'm from the mayor's office. He's sorry that he couldn't come down here. - [Officer On Bullhorn] Please move back. - [Man] The hell with that! We ain't goin' nowhere! - Nowhere! - Let's move inside. [Crowd Chanting] No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! - No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! - [Glass Shatters] No justice, no peace! Eric Kuransky. Adam Duke. They are detectives in the eighth district. - Decorated detectives. - Oh, thank you, Captain Hoopes. - Uh-huh. - Anyway, they were chasing a drug dealer up on the roof... when they found this kid named Andre Ricks. Now, Andre's in the hospital with two gunshot wounds and a broken back. Duke and Kuransky say that Andre pulled a gun on them. - Yeah, because he did. - You were there? No, but I trust my men. - That's nice. - Andre's father says... these two are lying, and that his son never even owned a gun. - And, of course, we should trust the kid's father. - Maybe we should. - Was a gun found at the scene? - Yeah. In the alley a few feet from where Andre fell. And it wasn't planted there. It was the kid's gun. You got your head up your ass. Excuse me? You've got your head up your ass. [Hoopes] Great. Mayor brings in a guy to investigate, and he's already on your side. No, he's got his head up his ass too. There's only three people know what happened on that roof... the ones that were there. So, excuse us. We're gonna talk to someone useful. I've been on the job, uh, four years. Made detective a year ago March. - All right. - I'd never fired my gun at a person before. First time for everything, right? How are you feelin'? You look pretty calm. Uh, I guess it's not real yet. Eight years on the homicide squad in St. Louis. - Four years in Narcotics before that. - Oh. This was a good shoot. You ask what you gotta, but I'm telling you... there's nothing wrong here. Eric went out the door first. I was... Um... Sorry, no. That's not right. - I went out first. Eric followed me. - Did you identify yourselves? Absolutely. No question. When did you first see the gun? Uh, as soon as the kid stepped out. How far away from Ricks were you? Maybe 10 feet. - So, how far? - Fourteen, 15 feet away. - You're sure about that, right? - I know where I was. Well, I'm sure you do. How far is it from your bathroom to your bedroom? Twenty feet. You hear that pause? He had to think to measure a distance that he walks every day. Yet, when I asked him about how far he was from Andre Ricks... no pause. He prepared his answer. Look at this. - Did you plant the gun on Andre Ricks? - Excuse me? Did I plant the gun? No. No, I did not. Look, he said he didn't do it. What's the problem? Soft voice. It drops away when you lack confidence in what you're saying. - He's lying. - These cops are not lying. - Oh, you're half right. - I don't understand. You just said they were. No, I said... this cop's lying. This one isn't. As far as we could tell, Adam Duke didn't lie once. But they're telling the same story. - So how can one be lying and one be telling the truth? - I can't tell you that yet. But what I can tell you is whatever happened up on that roof... it's not what you guys think. - [Police Radio Chatter] - Get those interviews uploaded. Fine. Good night. [Camera Shutter Clicking] - [Engine Starts] - Stay with him. [Man] #Dream, send me a sign # # Turn back the clock # # Give me some time # #I need to break out # #Make a new name # #Let's open our eyes # # To the brand-new day ## ##[Alternative] ##[Man Singing, Indistinct] - Hey. - Hey. What time is it? Mmm, a little past 3:00. I'm sorry I had to take off earlier. - Lightman doesn't believe in office hours. - It's okay. I hope you don't mind I stayed. No. I'm glad you did. I need a shower. You know, I could, uh, make sure you don't slip or fall in there. Mmm. Mmm... [Sighs] Hey, um, somebody called. - They, uh, left a message. It didn't pick up. - Can you play the machine? - [Electronic Voice] One message. - [Beeps] [Eli] Uh, hey. It's me. - Loker? - I couldn't sleep. I thought you might be awake. Uh... [Exhales] - Okay. Sorry. - What's that about? - See ya at work. - He's a little freaked out. - [Machine Beeps] - He did something bad at work. And then he lied to our boss about it. - And now, I am his therapist. - Wait. So... he did something that could get him fired, and he told you all about it? He was scared. - He made you a part of his mess? - He just needed to talk to somebody. I mean, isn't that what friends do? Confide in each other? You know what a real friend does when he's got a secret? He keeps his mouth shut. So do you have secrets you're not telling me? Lots of 'em. Because I... am a very good friend. I was really hoping there would be some clarity by this morning. We're still trying to figure out what these men are telling us. Kuransky looks like he's lying. But he's also highly emotional. - I've seen fear, anxieties and paranoia. - Which means? He could be suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. You wanna tell me how? Because he didn't fire his gun. It can be brought on by repeated exposure to violent events. I mean, he's been a cop for over 10 years. I mean, he's seen a lot. Okay. So if he's got P. T.S.D., does that mean he's not lying? Nope. We need to establish a baseline. I wanna see what these guys look like when they're not stressed. I wanna see their service records... and I want video of them interviewing suspects. I don't have time for a psychological study. What I needed was an answer. Thanks for your help. I heard there was another anti police demonstration in the eighth ward. - How many arrested? - Eighteen. How many ended up in hospital? - Four. - All right. You get us what we want, we'll get you the truth. It's the only way to stop more people gettin' hurt, right? Fine. Look, there's a simple answer. Duke is telling the truth. The kid pulled a gun on him. Kuransky's lying to back up his partner. No, that doesn't explain why Kuransky's so agitated. There's something else going on with him. - Hey, it's time for that staff meeting. - That's yours. No, actually, it's yours. Wait. Since when do we have staff meetings? - [Chattering] - Hi. Uh, let's not spend too much time on this. - We're being sued. - Some of you worked on the Joseph Hollin case. He was the banker whose daughter ran a Ponzi scheme with his investors' money. They're suing everybody that was involved in the failed attempt to recover his assets. - And that includes us. - [Cal] So our lawyer's gonna wanna talk to you individually. Damages could run into hundreds of millions, which I don't happen to have. So, you know, do your best to answer the questions as truthfully as possible. All right? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come here. Come here. Come here. [Sighs] You know how to lie to the lawyer, right? - What do you mean? - Don't answer too quickly. Short response time... That's a dead giveaway. And, uh, remember something that you got wrong. Correct yourself. Don't look him in the eye too much. Include irrelevant details. Oh, and if you feel nervous, take a couple of these. - Muscle relaxants? - Lawyer should be pretty easy to beat. But you never know if Lightman's gonna look at the tape. I... I... I cannot believe you're asking me to cover for you, Loker. You're the one who blew the Hollin case. You lied about it. - You're the reason we're being sued. - It's not just about me. If what I did gets out, Lightman is in serious trouble. The investors will bankrupt him, and they'll turn this place into a day spa. So I shouldn't lie to save your ass. I should lie to save the company. Sarcasm aside, yes. You haven't been lying long enough for you to be any good at it. [Knocking] Mr. Ricks? Okay, what was Andre doing on the roof? He goes up there to smoke cigarettes. I don't allow it in the house, so he goes outside. Sometimes, he ends up on that roof. He likes it up there 'cause you can see the river. You're his brother, right? Antwon. How you doin', Antwon? Something you wanna tell us? - No. - [Mr. Ricks] No, the idea that... Andre just pointed a gun at somebody, it's ridiculous! I mean, that boy never held a gun in his life. I think Antwon would disagree with you there. Wouldn't you? Eh? What are you talking about? You got something you're trying not to tell us? - If you know something, say it. - He had a gun. He was gettin' jumped by the Collin Terrace crew. [Sighs] He got scared. So he got a gun to protect himself. Just because Andre had a gun doesn't mean he pointed it at Kuransky and Duke. Yeah, well, we can't dismiss the possibility. - We have to talk to Andre. - Well, is there any chance of that happening soon? Nah, he's unconscious. Uh, how's it goin' with the detectives? I've been looking over months of suspect interviews. Kuransky is lying everywhere. Places he's been, cases he's worked. Also, his anxiety, when he talked about the shooting... - that wasn't from P.T.S.D. - [Cal] Okay. There is definitely something going on with this guy. I just don't know what it is. Well, keep digging. I'll be back as soon as possible. All right? Dr. Lightman. Special Agent Owen Finnegan with the F.B.I. - We need to talk. Please get in the car. - Why? I'll explain shortly. Please get in the car. - Am I under arrest? - No. But I am authorized to compel you should you not choose to accompany us voluntarily. Please get in the car, sir. Dr. Lightman. You were given access to top secret material... when you were consulting with C.I.A. So I'm gonna trust you with some information you shouldn't have. - Sit down. - Okay. [Finnegan] You know Special Agent Kuransky? Ah, see, I knew there was something wrong with you. Kuransky's one of several special agents undercover in the Metro Police Department. - Why? - We believe a small group of terrorists... have infiltrated law enforcement in D.C. There's a network of sleepers... individuals linked to Al-Qaeda... inside the police force... who are helping to plan a strike. Adam Duke is a member of this network. His real name is Adam Matduka. He's Albanian by birth. And as you may know, Al Qaeda is believed to funnel money... through groups in Macedonia and Albania. He says he changed his name to break with his family, but that's not true. He's still in contact with relatives back home. We estimate three to five sleepers like Duke are inside the police force. That's why he hasn't been arrested yet. We want Duke to identify the others. I've been partners with Duke for 16 months. I'm inside his head. I will get those names. - What's your source? - We can't tell you that. - What's the target? - We can't tell you that. - [Chuckling] - But we do believe it'll happen soon... very soon, if we don't intervene. That's why you gotta back off the Ricks case. Everyone in the department knows you're lookin' at me and Duke. If the other sleepers think you're on to who Duke really is, they will kill him. - Then we have nothing. - If Andre Ricks recovers... if... he could go to jail for a crime he may not have committed. And you're telling me to back off because of a terrorist threat you won't even describe. - It's a bit of a joke, really. - No, it's not. This is real. These people wanna inflict major casualties on this city... and if that happens because you got in the way, that's gonna be on your head. All right, I've got a question for you. Did Andre Ricks have a gun in his hand... - when Adam Duke shot him? - [Kuransky] I told you that already. Yes. That shoot was good. You see, now, there's the problem. You're still lyin'. I'll see myself out. You know, the fact that Kuransky is undercover... could explain why he appears to be lying about the shooting. - How? - Well, sometimes undercover cops... can develop symptoms of disassociation. I mean, pretending to be somebody else can make them anxious... and paranoid, and it can look like they're lying even if they're telling the truth. Maybe he's just a bad liar. - I think we should keep diggin'. - I don't think we should be pushing it on this one. - What are you, F.B.I. now? - No. If they're trying to stop a terrorist cell... then yeah, I wanna be careful about getting in the way. National security is just their favorite bogeyman. This whole sleeper cell thing smells fake to me. Not every threat is a lie. You know, a plane flew into the Pentagon. My husband was there. I remember that day, Cal... and I would do almost anything to prevent that from happening again. Well, I'll tell that to Andre Ricks. I'm sure he'll feel the same way. - That is not fair. - It's not fair to him. - You can't take the government at their word. - Unless they're right. And if an attack is really being planned, then everybody's at risk. [Cell Phone Chimes] It's Torres. A gas station in Anacostia got robbed last year. This image was released by Metro Police from the security camera. - Recognize the face? - Andre robbed a store? Yeah, I guess he had a gun and knew how to use it. - Get that cleaned up. - Yeah. Hey, uh, paralegal's looking for you. The lawyer wants to talk to you. - Now? - Yeah, I guess so. [Man] I will, uh, just be a minute. Oh. I'm, uh, Wexler, by the way. - Martin Wexler. - Hi. Do you need to swear me in before we start? No, no. This, uh... This isn't a formal deposition. Okay. Uh, will there be one later? Not necessarily. Depends on what you say. Do you have a problem with that? No. No. - Are you sure about that? - Yeah. Listen. Ria, I'm just here for the facts. You give me the truth, we're good. If you don't, we're not. It's really that simple. Do you understand? There's no problem. - Can you clean this up? - [Eli] Yeah. Already doing it. All right, blow it up. Can you get it? - There we go. - That's the kid the cop shot. Yep. Yes, it is. It's an interesting case. - Uh-huh. - Let me know if there's anything else I can do. Well, you can talk less. What do you see? Um... nothin'. Exactly. No contempt, no fear. Not even pleasure. That's a face at rest. Doesn't look like the face of someone robbing a store, does it? Cops Photoshopped Andre's face on someone else's body? They're framing him? Nah, it's not the cops. That's, uh... That's done with some very good equipment. That looks like the F.B.I. to me. Cal! Good God! Could your posture get any worse? You're a walking question mark. How's tricks at the C.I. A? Less amusing since you stopped coming by. I miss your special gift for pissing people off. So, what's so important we had to meet right away? The F.B.I. said there's terrorists inside the D.C. Police Department. Is that true? Why would you wanna ask about that? 'Cause I think they're trying to frame a kid to shut down an investigation. Is this the kid that got shot by the two cops? - Yeah. - Who's trying to frame him? Special agent by the name of Finnegan. He falsified some evidence. I know Finnegan. He's the straightest arrow in the quiver. If somebody's doctoring evidence, it isn't him. What do you know about these sleepers? Cal, you need to steer clear of this one. You know better than to tell me that. Why are you so scared, Fletcher? I've read the intel. The threat is real. This isn't Hussein and his disappearing weapons of mass destruction. This is a network financed by people who wanna hit us hard. Half of Langley's stocking up on duct tape and plastic sheeting. - What's the target? - The theory is... they're going after government buildings. State Department, Supreme Court... Who knows? Maybe the C.I.A. So the F.B.I.'s telling the truth? Sleepers inside the police department? I don't know. But what I do know is that you should stay out of it. Whatever's gonna happen to this kid is nothing compared to what could happen in this city. People could get hurt, Cal. A lot of people. Just to be clear, you didn't like the fact that... your boss was making a deal with Joseph Hollin. Well, I thought it was the wrong thing to do. But that's not my call to make. That's Dr. Foster's. Right, right. And when exactly... did you find out that the deal had been blown up? Tuesday... Uh, no. Sorry. Wednesday morning. I saw it online just before I came to work. - That was the first you heard of it? - That's right. Yeah. Okay. Did you blow up the deal? - No. - Did you go to the S.E. C... against Dr. Foster's wishes? - No, I didn't. - You're a logical person. You already admitted you didn't want it to happen. Yeah, and the reason that you know that is because I just told you. Pretty stupid of me to do that if I blew it up, isn't it? Okay. Good. That's all I need. - That's it? - Yes. Thank you very much for your time. All right. Thank you. [Exhales Sharply] - The income projections you asked for. - Oh, yeah. And you got a call from Corey Strong in the mayor's office. - Said he couldn't reach you on your cell. - That happens all the time. [Chattering] - Stay in touch. - I will. Thanks. - Who's that? - Just an acquaintance. Hi. - Oh, yeah? - Where have you been? Talking to a friend about the terrorist threat. He says it's real. This could get complicated. I just got a call from the hospital. - Andre Ricks is conscious, and he's willing to talk. - All right. [Monitor Beeping] I still can't feel anything below my waist. - Doctors keep telling me to wiggle my toes. - Any luck? Not yet. Okay. Look, uh, I've gotta ask you a couple of questions, all right? - Andre? - Yeah. Okay. You own a gun, right? Yeah. All right. Where is it? I threw it away. It was stupid to get it. When you went up on the roof... did you have a gun on you? No. I told you, it was gone. All I had up there was my phone and my cigarettes. Do you remember what happened when you were shot? Not really. I remember people shoutin' from far away. Then I woke up here. Did you see the lip pout when I asked if he had a gun on the roof? He seemed genuinely hurt by the idea. Now, you wouldn't see that if he was lying, right? He could've denied owning the gun altogether. He didn't. No, he's telling the truth. I don't think he was armed when Duke shot him. We need to call the mayor. This kid could do 10, 20 years. Yeah, but if we do say something, what happens to the F.B.I. investigation? That's not our concern. You want me to lie to the mayor? No, but we have to consider it, Cal. A van pulls up in front of a building, and there's an explosion. I mean, your contact said the threat is real. There's always gonna be another bad guy. There's always gonna be another kid... they're gonna want to sacrifice. All right. Ricks was unarmed. He's the victim here. Yeah. Call the mayor. [Slurping] - Hey, uh, Loker. - Hey. - You know where, uh, Ria is? - She might be downstairs gettin' a latte. Uh-huh. Well, I got tickets to the Wizards game, but I gotta go to work. - Can you give 'em to her? - Yeah, sure. She deserves something nice. - What you mean? - Oh, nothing. Just she's good people. Solid. She did it, didn't she? She covered for you with that lawyer. - Um, I have no idea what you're talking about. - I told her... not to cover for your ass, but I guess she didn't listen. - That's a bit harsh. - Can I talk to you for a second? You don't get it, do you? If this thing gets out, you are both gonna get fired. Now, you're Mr. Ivy League, and you're gonna be okay... but Ria, she's going back to the airport. She's gonna be scanning luggage and taking it from passengers... with bad attitude all day long. She has so much more to lose than you that it's not even funny. But it doesn't matter to you, right? 'Cause you think she's "good people." Well, Eric went out the door first. I was... Uh...Sorry. No, that's not right. I went out first. Eric followed me. - Turn on the TV. - Hey, I don't see any signs of deception in Duke. - If he's a spy, I mean, how's he hiding it? - Turn on the TV. [Clears Throat] What we are saying is this is a cover-up, pure and simple. Why won't the authorities let Kuransky and Duke face their accusers? No, that's not right. No, I spoke to the mayor. Why isn't Duke in custody? The F.B.I.'s holding him. They won't turn him over to the D.C. Police. National security. Uh, as soon as the kid stepped out. [Ria] And how far away from Ricks were you? Maybe 10 feet. - What? - They're not gonna get anything out of Duke. Why? You said... Kuransky was suffering from disassociation... because of being undercover, right? Yeah, yeah. Being undercover is hard to take. All right. Was it a problem for Duke? - No, not at all. - Well, if he's a terrorist... he's been undercover longer than Kuransky. So his symptoms should be worse. Maybe they got it wrong. You know, maybe he's not a terrorist. I mean, that would explain why he didn't show any signs of deception. He wouldn't have been lying. I've looked at over a dozen interrogations... and there's no sign of deception in Duke. Here it is. This is the one I've been looking for. It's Duke questioning a neo-Nazi. I think this country is a whore bitch. Dechristianized, mongrelized, Obama-nized. The streets are sewers filled with human trash. The cities reek with moral decay... Look at Duke. See that contempt smile? - He's offended. - Yeah, if he were a terrorist... obsessed with attacking America, he wouldn't hate this guy. - He'd agree with him. - Well, maybe he's not a sleeper. The F.B.I. have been investigating Duke for over a year. How could they get it so wrong? Haven't you done enough? You already destroyed an undercover operation... we spent years putting in place. - It put the wrong man in custody. - Why? Because Duke doesn't have a personality disorder? Because he looked irritated when some skinhead yelled at him? Gimme a break. Well, you've been interrogating Duke. What have you got? Well, you've been on him for hours. You got nothing, right? You're startin' to worry, startin' to think you might have screwed up. I can see it in your face. You can't afford to make a mistake here. Damn it. - How'd we get it wrong about Duke? - You may have had some help. A Photoshop picture of Andre Ricks was given to the police. - I don't know anything about that. - I believe you. You got a bigger problem here than Duke. One of your people's gone rogue. Hey. Uh, sorry about the wait. What am I doing here? Finnegan just said show up. What is this? - Yeah, I want to talk. - Yeah, about what? Sit down. About spies. See, there's two kinds of spies, right? There's spies that gather good information... and then there's spies that spread bad information. Yeah. I think you're one of the latter. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you saying? Well, you said that Adam Duke was a terrorist. In fact, the whole case against him is based on what you've said. - He is a terrorist. - No, he's not. Which means that you're either incredibly stupid... or you're giving bad information to the F.B.I. You accusing me of working for the other side? You saying I'm Al-Qaeda? I got a picture of Osama in my wallet? - I didn't say that. - What the hell are you saying then? See, that's good. You're pretty good. I'm not seeing any fear. I'm only seeing anger. - Huh. - I mean, the photograph though that you sent to the police... of Andre... That was crude. That showed desperation. Look. You think I've been bought off, you check my bank account. - I got nothin'. - That's true. But you did have something. Didn't you? You used to have something. You had... a daughter. Specialist Jacqueline Kuransky. To hell with this. I'm not doing this. Hey, not until your boss tells you to. Sit down. On October 14, 2005, Specialist Jacqueline Kuransky... was killed by enemy fire while on patrol in Tikrit. Well, that's not true, is it? She was killed by friendly fire. We have the file. But you... Not that they'd admit it. I mean, what's their line? "Under investigation." Now, you're getting angrier. That's good. I can understand that. I mean, if somebody did this to my kid, I'd wanna tear their head off. - She deserves the truth. - Yes, she does. She died wearing her uniform. She deserves the truth. [Cal] Yes, she does. You wanna get back at the people you think killed your daughter. Now, I understand that. That is... basic. They lied. And they lied about everything. They lied about how long she would be there... what she would do, what kind of armor her truck would have. They even lied about how she died. [Chuckles] All they did was tell lies. Well... [Sniffles] I can lie too. There you go. Kuransky gave us four more sleepers. - Were they police? - No. They were E.M.T.'s. Paramedics. - Why them? - It was planned as a double attack. An initial explosion to produce casualties. And the ambulances would arrive driven by sleepers... and stuffed with more explosives. We would've waved those ambulances right in without thinking twice... because Kuransky had us convinced that the terrorists were police. He told the F.B.I. that I was a terrorist? What does this have to do with the shooting? Well, Kuransky's story depended on you being on the police force. And when you shot Andre Ricks, he knew you could get arrested. So he had to make the shooting look justified. Hey, that shoot was good. No, it wasn't. When Kuransky got down to the street... he saw Andre wasn't armed, so he put a gun on him. He had a gun on the roof. I was there. I saw it. No, what you saw was this. His cell phone. You saw a gun because you believed he had one. It-It wasn't there. [Kuransky] Put your hands where we can see 'em! Hold it! Listen to me, Detective. Before you say anything, you talk to a lawyer. [Exhales Sharply] How's the kid? The doctors say there's no lasting damage to his spinal cord. So he should recover. Tell him, uh... Tell him I'm sorry. [Sighs] Quick, in my office. Before you say anything, it was me. I blew up the deal. I- I went to the S.E.C. I lied to Foster about it. I still think it was the right thing to do. But no one else was involved. It was just me. I knew that. - You did? - Yeah. - Yeah, I've known that all along. - Why didn't you say anything? - 'Cause I decided to run a test. - What kind of test? The lawsuit. That was a test. You lied to everyone in the office so you could treat me like a lab rat? No. No, I was testing Torres. - Why? - 'Cause I could tell she knew what you'd done. I mean, there was no surprise there. But we have a lot of secrets here. So I wanted to see... if she could keep one under pressure. - Are you gonna fire her for not turning me in? - No. I'd fire her if she had. Loyalty's crucial here. But you, on the other hand, what you did is inexcusable. And involving her is selfish... disrespectful, and just plain stupid. I'll empty my office. No, you can stay. You can stay. But... from now, you'll be paid what you're worth, which is nothing. You're an unpaid intern. It's that, or you can leave. - So what's he gonna do? - I don't know. Didn't hang around to find out. Loker... isn't the only one who lied. Oh, yeah? That woman who came in yesterday... That's Alec's sponsor. He had a problem with cocaine... before we were married. But he's been in recovery since. A couple of months ago, he started using again. And he's just trying to stay clean. How's he doing? Some days are good, some... not so good. Well, if there's anything I can do... You didn't just happen to find Alec's glasses the other night, did you? You thought he was having an affair. No, I was afraid you were gonna get hurt. - You were protecting me? - Something like that, yeah. You know... the line we talk about? You know, the line we have to draw because we see things people are hiding. Things they don't want us to know. I think we should respect the line. I think it's best for both of us. Good night, Cal. ##[Alternative] Good night, love. [Man] #So long # # You went alone # #Holding on # # To what you'll never know # # Who were you pretending you should be ##
