 - ##[Man Singing, Indistinct] - I can't believe you're really here. - You should've called me first. - And ruin the surprise? No way. You tell Mom and Dad you were coming out? [Scoffs] Are you kidding? I finished my last final and took the first flight I could get. - They're gonna freak out. - Ah. They'll get over it. So, I figured since you couldn't be home for the holidays... - I'd bring a piece of home to you. - What are you talking about? Say hello to my little friends. Marcus, you can't bring that here. - What's the big deal? - Get rid of it right now.

 Oh, relax. We'll smoke it back at your place. Put it away. Put it back in your pack right now. - Why? - Just do it, Marcus! Don't look at them. Stay calm. Really calm. [Tires Screeching] What's going on? Who are these people? They're Yemeni military. Don't say anything. Keep your hands where they can see them. - [Shouting In Arabic] - They've got guns. What do we do? [Shouting Continues] - Don't say anything. - [Shouting Continues] - Marcus, don't say anything. - Nicole, what do we do? Shut up, Marcus! - [Groans] - Nicole, what do we do?

 - Don't say a word. - Okay. - Tell me what to do. - Shut up, Marcus. [Chattering In Arabic] - Hashish! Hashish! - [Shouting In Arabic] Nicole, what do we do? I... I disrespected the most holy laws. I do not deny this. I'm so sorry for my actions. I'm deeply, deeply sorry. I am guilty of my crimes. I do not deny this. I also apologize... and beg forgiveness. They sound terrible. Do you hear how terrible they sound? - Diane, you gotta let 'em do their job. - [Man] Listen, I told you... that we're negotiating with the Yemeni government to release your children. We're just having trouble getting a read on their negotiator. And that is why we hired the Lightman Group. We understand how hard this must be. We can tell you that last year the Lightman Group... - helped free several American hostages in Colombia. - You have to be patient. It's been 29 days, and my children... are halfway around the world having God knows what done to them. Don't tell me to be patient. You might've tried a little diplomacy with Mom and Dad there. Please. I don't have time to hold hands. The situation's getting worse by the minute. Why are the Yemenis detaining them? The brother Marcus was visiting the sister on spring break. Yemeni police pulled 'em over for speeding. They find an ounce of marijuana in the car. Under Islamic law, trafficking drugs is punishable by death. Nicole slurred a few words. Have they been tortured? Well, she might've seemed sleep-deprived. But Yemen is definitely not known for its humane treatment of foreign prisoners. [Eli] Is that their negotiator? Yep. The guy speaks in monotone, has an endless list of demands. And we have no idea what he actually needs to get a deal done. So if you can pick up anything in his speech or his body language... - Get a read on him. - We'll take a look at the negotiation footage we... I don't need details. Okay? I need answers. Nicole and Marcus are being sentenced in two days. If we don't start making progress, they're gonna be facing execution. [Man] #Dream, send me a sign # # Turn back the clock # # Give me some time # #I need to break out # #Make a new name # #Let's open our eyes # # To the brand-new day ## [Woman] Good afternoon. Lightman Group. - Dr. Buchanan. - Yes. - Hi. Ria Torres. - Hi. - Dr. Lightman's just finishing up a call. - Oh, great. You must be the new wunderkind he's told me so much about. - Oh. - How many times has he lied to you? - Excuse me? - Well, he said you're a natural. You must've caught him in some big fat ones. - Yeah, maybe one or two. - One or two? He's mellowed out. Back in the day, he was pathological. - Really? - Oh, seriously. The morning of my 25th birthday, I look out my dorm window... and there parked outside is a vintage Harley registered in my name. I have no idea how he pulled that off. - Come on. - I'm serious. That boy lied, cheated and stole his way through Oxford. - I never stole. - [Chuckles] So you say. - Hey. Ah, it's good to see you. - And you. - [Grunts] - You good? - Yeah, I'm good. - I trust Jeffrey introduced himself. - Yep. - Former U.S. Surgeon General. - Used to be quite an important man. - Don't let him fool you. I'm still quite an important man. [Chuckling] Yeah. - Something wrong, Jeffrey? - I need your help, Cal. [Woman] He's 27! Who has a stroke at 27? Mrs. Coleman, Ribocore will do everything we can to help you. Everything? What are you doing to track down the people who did this to my husband? - Well, we actually... - [Jeffrey] That's Erica Vandeman. She's the C.E.O. of Ribocore Pharmaceutical. Is that one of the companies that throws money at you? I only take their money if I believe in 'em. Erica was a student of mine at Georgetown. She's one of the good guys. Six weeks ago, someone broke into the Ribocore labs. Stole the formula for Priox. It's their new insulin pill. Recently... a cheaper knockoff version hit the market. And it's killing people, Cal. Drew Coleman is the third case we've found. They all took the knockoff. Priox is a complicated compound. Run the formula the wrong way, and the side effects can be lethal. Why don't you just call in the F.D. A? F.D.A. investigation would take months. Our I.T. guys say the data theft is an inside job. Only three chemists have lab access. They're all denying they were involved. If you could tell us who's lying... we can find out who's making the knockoff and shut them down. If we don't get this counterfeit drug off the market soon... we are looking at hundreds of deaths. Okay. The Ribocore theft took place at 2:27 a.m... in testing lab 290. And one of you disabled the scanner so it couldn't identify your key card. - I'm a chemist, not an engineer. - I wasn't even in the building that night. Now, you managed to avoid the security cameras. But... You know, this is ridiculous. I've worked for Ribocore for 15 years. But one of you, when you downloaded the Priox formula... left your fingerprint on the data port. Well, you can check mine. Come on. I use that computer all the time. So do I. I mean, you can't possibly think... No, I don't. So you two can go. - So... why did you steal the Priox formula? - I didn't. Go ahead. Check my fingerprints. - You didn't leave any. - I made that up. - What are you talking about? - [Cal] Our thief wore gloves. But you knew that, didn't you? That's why you leapt at the chance to prove your innocence. Now, only a guilty person would know that the fingerprint couldn't possibly be theirs. - [Sighs] - All right. Call Vandeman, tell her we found who stole the information. - It's not what you think. - No, see, it's not what you think. That formula you sold, your knockoff Priox... - it's killing people. - You're wrong. I didn't break into the lab to steal the formula. Why then? Two months ago, I came across a lab study... that said stroke was a possible Priox side effect. Vandeman had buried the full report. But it was in the database in testing lab 290. I was trying to build a case against the drug. The problem isn't knockoff Priox. It's the real drug that's the killer. - This is new. - [Chuckles] I asked Grace not to let anybody back here. I'm going on Larry King to talk up the new flu vaccine. So this is just, you know, saving time. Does your missus know how much you spend on makeup? And unless you want Larry King to know how you got drunk... and talked your way past White House security... - Never happened. - Oh, that never happened? Well, this never happened either. - I need to talk to you about Erica Vandeman. - Yeah. - Derek, just, um, give us a second. Thanks. - Sure, sure. You find out who broke into the lab and stole the formula? The chemist who broke into the lab wasn't after the formula. Really? "Early stage testing on Priox. "Blood clotting leading... to stroke." What? This chemist is pretending to be some kind of a whistle blower? No, a study says that the real drug is the killer. Cal, that doesn't make sense. Why would Erica hire you? Damage control? You hire us... - and you spin this into a story about a counterfeit drug. - No, not Erica. If she thought this drug was killing people, she'd be first to pull it off the market. Well, the chemist doesn't appear to be lying. - And the study indicates that... - Indicates what? What does it indicate? It indicates nothing. Maybe that lab was careless. Maybe they made a mistake. - So you think I should talk to them? - Cal. I have known Erica Vandeman for years. And you spent, what, five minutes with this chemist? I'm as worried about this drug as you are. So give me the name, and I will look into this. Okay. - Hey, Heather. - Gillian. What are you doing here? We're working with Peters on the Yemeni negotiations. Is my husband... He's at lunch. Well, tell him I stopped by. - You're here early. - I like to be prepared. Oh. Well, you're not billing me for it. - Where's the Chia Pet? - Loker? Yeah. That guy definitely needs a shave and a haircut. He's monitoring the closed-circuit cameras... so we can do stress analysis on the Yemenis. But I'm sure he'll appreciate the tip. - Very funny. - [Door Opens] Dr. Gillian Foster, meet Deputy Ambassador Hassan. It's a pleasure meeting you. I trust you've been briefed on our position? - She wouldn't mind hearing it again. - Very well. - We have several demands. - [Gillian] Yes, I'm sure. But, actually, I'd prefer to hear it from Deputy Ambassador Rafik. I'm happy to oblige. As Deputy Ambassador Hassan was saying, we have several demands. Well, you don't know what the hell you're doing. We have two days... and you wasted the entire session talking to Rafik? - The guy's a mid-level bureaucratic schlub. - Actually, he's not. Loker, can you pull up the Camp David video? This is Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak at Camp David. See how they're trying to shove each other through the door? [Eli] Yeah, in the Middle East, appearances are very important. The most powerful person is always the last through the door. [Gillian] When the Yemeni delegation entered the room... your man Hassan wasn't the last one through the door... Rafik was. That's why you couldn't get a read. Hassan's a puppet. He has no idea which demands are important. They wanted this to go down to the wire so they can get the best deal. They were trying to keep us in the dark. Okay, so did you get anything off of Rafik? Well, we got clear vocal spikes on the demands he cares about the most. Of course, he wasn't the only one. Yes, but obviously, it goes without saying... that any deal must secure the release of both... Nicole Braden and her brother Marcus. We hired you to focus on the other side of the table, not ours. Well, we catch the lies wherever they come from. And the vocal stress in your voice... is three times higher when you mention Nicole. You care more about getting her released than Marcus. Why? We can't do our jobs unless we know your priorities. I'm only gonna say this once. I want Marcus released just as much as Nicole. You got it? - [Door Closes] - "I'm only gonna say this once"? Classic qualifying statement. He wouldn't need it if he was telling the truth. Will you get a hold of Nicole and Marcus's confession videos? Let's see what we can pick up. - [Chattering] - [Woman] No, I agree. Hey. I just set up the meeting with Neeman Labs for tomorrow morning. - Yeah. Postpone it. - Well, I thought you wanted to talk to them... - about the mouse study. - Yeah. Jeffrey's looking into it. - Dr. Buchanan? - Yep. Told him about A'isha. Told him about the study. He said he'd look into it. - What? So we're just dropping it? - Yep, for now. - You think this one is ever gonna stop talking back? - I hope not. - Half day? - [Alec] Hope you don't mind. Had an hour free for dinner. Thought I'd steal her away. No problem. What? What now? You saw her covering, right? I mean, you saw how upset she looked. Yeah, congratulations. Once again, you've arrived... at the apparently foreign destination of none of your damn business. - [Sighs] Man, I don't get you. - Good. - Stop trying. - Fine. Pretend like you don't give a damn what's going on with her. I know you do. Sit down. Sit down. Look. In case you haven't figured it out yet... it's different when you're one of us. Everybody has things they don't wish to share. - She's your friend. - You're not listening to me. In this workplace... with everything that we see, we have to be very clear on the rules. You and Foster have rules? If there's something she wants to tell me, she will. Everything else... Everything else I see, I ignore. - I trust her to take care of it herself. - Wow. When did you get religion? You trust Foster. You trust Buchanan. You were there. A'isha Ward was telling the truth. - Jeffrey will get to the bottom of this. - He brought us the case. - Don't you think he's just a little biased? - Okay. How many people in this world do you trust? - How many? - I don't know. Ten. Six. All right. Well, when you get to my age, it'll be three. And when one of those people asks you for 24 hours, you give it to 'em. Dr. Lightman? Uh, Dr. Buchanan left you a message. - Well, can you get him on the line? - Yeah. But you might want to take a look at this first. Mmm. I guess he did get to the bottom of it. [Jeffrey] Really nice to meet you. Thank you so much for your hospitality. Tell Larry I'll come back anytime he'd like. Thank you. - Cal, what are you doing here? - You gave up A'isha Ward. And a good evening to you, sir. You went straight to Vandeman. - You didn't even bother to call. - Well, Cal... I didn't realize we were going steady, but I did try you at your office. Hey. There's serious questions here. I stopped investigatin'. Cal, you were not hired to investigate Ribocore. You were hired to investigate who broke into their lab. Drug's killing people. I have six lab reports on Priox, including a 9,000-person study. Priox did not cause strokes in any of them. Only the knockoff does that. Ribocore's issued a warning, and they're working with police to find the distributor. - You read through this study? - Vandeman walked me through them, yes. - Oh, really? - She also showed me this. The police did a little more digging. A'isha Ward had $500,000 wired into a savings account... from an offshore bank just before the break-in. That would be four times her annual salary. She stole the formula, Cal. She stole it. She sold it. Now she's trying to cover it up. I'm not easily fooled, Jeffrey. I know. That makes her one hell of a liar. [Cell Door Closes] What do you want? Well, I love being duped. It doesn't happen often. But, you know, I'm intrigued. So we can either chitchat, or... you can tell us the truth. I gave you the truth, and you ran right back to Vandeman. You're incredible. She's incredible. You're incredible. You know, it's not hard to find a good liar. But a truly great one... That's rare. I am not lying. Oh, your bank statement says you are. 500 grand wired to your account. Now, that sounds about right for the formula to a billion-dollar drug. So who'd you sell it to? - Doesn't matter. - Oh, so you admit it? - You sold the formula? - Sure, I sold it. But I didn't need to break into the lab for that. I knew the formula by heart. I sold it months before the break-in. - So why break into the lab at all? - I told you. I found the summary for the mouse study. I wanted the full report. Mouse study was an outlier. Just one bad test. Did you talk to Neeman Labs? That study's evidence that Priox is a killer. Yes, I sold the formula. But then I found the study, and... It tore at my conscience. I had to do something. So first, corporate thief. Then, whistle blower. That's what you want us to believe, right? Please. Someone has to get Priox off the market. The knockoff I sold is the same as the real thing... and the real thing is killing people. Go to Neeman Labs. They'll tell you. Thanks for seeing us at such short notice, Dr. Dembeck. Uh, no problem. It's, uh... It's a light day. - Huh. Very light. - I wanna ask you a couple of questions... about, um, some testing you did on a drug called Priox. Um, I have nothing to say. Why is that? 'Cause you botched the test? Ooh. Anger's real. No shame, no guilt. Maybe Ribocore didn't like what they got back in their report. So why did they, uh, just drop you as a client then? They fired us. Okay? They blackballed us... and gave the drug to a lab that would give them the results that they wanted... that would test it into compliance. - And then after that, there was no more testing on... - Priox. No. But I have heard rumors about some of the other studies. You know, I got into this business to do cutting-edge research... try to help people. Apparently, science and business just don't mix. - Have you seen Dr. Lightman? - He went down to the hospital. - D.C. General. - What for? Our Priox victim, Drew Coleman, he had another stroke. He's being taken off life support. - Oh, my God. - That's not all. I found anecdotal evidence online. Two more stroke cases linked to Priox. Both victims young, both in good physical shape. That's still not gonna be enough to get it pulled off the market. [Beeping] I'll be right back. Hey. Torres told me you were here. Is everything okay? Not for Mr. Coleman it's not. Maybe A'isha Ward was right. You don't have to do this. If you want to choose your friendship first... you can just hand this over to the authorities, let somebody else investigate it. Yeah, I'm sure they'd do a bang-up job. I'm just saying that... you can walk away. And what if the drug really is killing people? Eh? Come on. I need to show you something back at work. I'm so sorry for my actions. - I'm deeply, deeply sorry. - So like I told you... we think the State Department is more interested in getting his sister out. Well, there's nothing noteworthy here. Yeah, but check out Nicole. I also apologize... and beg forgiveness. At first, we thought it was just sleep deprivation. - But she doesn't look fatigued. - Yeah, no slouching, no leaning. I mean, I guess that could be adrenaline. No, she's not sleep-deprived. She's slurring her words intentionally. The U.S. should leave Iraq now. Saddam Hussein is a great leader. I don't understand. Who is this soldier? He's an American P.O.W. from the first Gulf War. But what's relevant here is that he's using... the same speech pattern in his confession that your daughter does. [Gillian] It's a code. The army teaches soldiers... to slur their words if captured or forced to give a confession. The enemy can't hear the difference. It signals that they haven't broken you. It's part of the military's survival, evasion, resistance and escape training. Military training? Neither of our children have any military training. The State Department files don't mention any. I'm sorry. What are you saying? - Diane, please. Would you just... - Don't do that, Robert! You've been telling me to be calm this whole time. Now, Marcus is a poetry major, for God's sake! What about your daughter? - This is a joke. - Mr. Braden? To my knowledge, Nicole's never been involved with the military. "To my knowledge." Are you telling us everything? - Robert? - [Gillian] Mr. Braden. I can't be effective without all the information. I can't give you all the information! Robert, what are you talking about? I can't tell you. I'm not supposed to know. I'd be breaking the law. She's U.S. Intelligence. She's a spy. What the hell were you thinking? - Uh, excuse me? - Our firm has a reputation for discretion. You have secrets, you tell us! Otherwise, we can't do our job! I still don't know what you're talking about. You know exactly what I'm talking about. Nicole Braden... is a spy. How was I supposed to tell you that? It's classified information. Get a lot of people killed, including Nicole. I wish I had known that earlier. Yeah? Well, maybe now you'll understand why I'm taking the deal. - Wait. What deal? - Rafik called an hour ago. He's offering to hand over one of the prisoners in exchange for their humanitarian demands. We're getting Nicole back. We'll do what we can for Marcus. No, that is a terrible call. It'll tear the family apart. Nicole will never be able to live with herself. Do you understand? That woman knows the address... to every C.I.A. safe house in the Middle East. And you're worried about her feelings? Rafik's demanding patriot missiles for Marcus. So it's a nonstarter. We're done here. I am getting Nicole back home... before the Yemenis find out who she is, and that is it. Dr. Foster. Mr. Braden. What are you doing here? The, uh, State Department hasn't been returning my calls. I didn't know where else to go. This is Miss McDermott from the Red Cross. One of their nurses was allowed to visit Marcus yesterday... and she managed to get these photos out. - What happened? - [McDermott] Apparently, he tried to escape. The Yemeni guards beat him severely. He has broken ribs and a concussion. He hasn't been allowed to see a doctor. Our nurse demanded that... Marcus be transferred to a medical facility for treatment. She was told there was no point in treating him. He's gonna be sentenced tomorrow. And then, they're gonna execute him. They're gonna shoot my son. Please. You gotta get him out. You need to raise the acidity if you want it to act as a compound. Oh! A scientist and a businesswoman. - No wonder Jeffrey was such an advocate. - Dr. Lightman. Miss Torres. - This is a pleasant surprise. - I'm sorry about the unexpected pop in. But I find the more time one has to prepare a lie, the harder it is for me to spot. Okay. Would you excuse us for a moment? - See you later. - So, what can I do for you? Oh, well, um, some of the pharmaceutical journals... found out I was involved in the case... and they called with a couple questions. So I thought I'd just run a few things by you. - Sure. - I appreciate that. Uh... Well, first then... the real Priox versus the knockoff drug. What exactly is the difference? Well, it's complicated. It has to do with the way that you run the compound. All right, well, try me. I was quite a chemist back at Oxford. There's certain proprietary information. Why don't you have the journals refer to me on that one? - Okay. - How about the mouse study Ms. Ward keeps mentioning? There's nothing to it. No other Priox testing showed any side effects. And all these labs, they're on the up-and-up, right? I am intimately involved with every one of those companies. I trust them all. Well, that's good. Because it's quite hard to find a company... one can trust these days, right? Hmm. So she bit her lip every time I went at her. - Incredibly anxious, that woman. - I don't know how we missed it earlier. Well, lie detection's all about asking the right questions. - What a shame. They were paying top dollar too. - [Cell Phone Dialing] - You calling reporters? - No. I made them up. Uh, Vandeman will be trying to track 'em down, which will buy us a little time. Time for what? Heidi? Yeah. Can you make an appointment with Jim Gunderson over at the F.D. A? Tell him it's urgent, all right? Yeah. I'm on my way back. It's mice, Cal. It's one study. Yeah, well, Vandeman's lying about the other tests. Well, even if you're right, there's not enough here to pull Priox off the market. I can start an investigation, but I can't do more than that. F.D.A. investigations take months. A lot of people could die, Jim. If you can prove Vandeman manipulated the testing, I'll recall the drug immediately. But without more hard data, my hands are tied. All right, well, uh, do you mind if I use your name? Throw it around, see if I can open a few doors? You should start with your friend Buchanan. He was a driving force behind the drug's approval. - Buchanan pushed the drug? - Yeah. I can show you about a dozen letters he submitted on behalf of Priox. You do know he's on the Ribocore payroll? But he's not involved in this. Jeffrey encouraged me to come and talk to you. I mean, he's as eager to get to the bottom of this as we are. "Jeffrey encouraged me to come see you"? - The walls of the F.D.A. have ears. - Yeah. Well, then I'm sure they could tell you were lying too. Hey, if Jeffrey knew what was going on... he would've come to the F.D.A. himself. The guy's on the payroll. He pushed the drug through F.D.A. approvals. - You can't really believe that. - You know, if it was someone in your family, right... how much proof would you need before you hung 'em out? - I... - Look, if Jeffrey knows about Priox, he's going to jail. But I'm gonna be damn sure before I send him there. All right? - Okay. - Good. I thought you said Peters was making the deal? Well, just because he's done doesn't mean we are. - He's almost comical with the sound off. - I'm trying to concentrate here. What? He's got the best posture I've ever seen. - He looks like Mussolini. - Well, he's trying to make himself look bigger. You know, men, gorillas, blowfish... You know, when they want to appear dominant, they puff themselves up. This guy's definitely compensating for something. Maybe you're onto something. Rafik really cares about appearances. He wants to look like a leader. That could be our leverage. [Gillian] Hey, I thought I heard you come back in. Where's Torres? I sent her off to talk to the labs... that tested Priox. You know, Jeffrey always loved the limelight. I can't tell you how many times... I'd come home, switched on the news, and there he is... in my living room... pushing some new drug or other. - Cal... - Merry-go-round of government, business and media. Enough money and fame to make your head spin, I suppose. Do you really think Jeffrey's guilty? I don't know. I don't know. You know, when my mother died... Jeffrey took the train back to London with me. And I'd only known him for about a month. But he skipped out of college and came with me just to keep me company. - So honestly, I don't know. - [Knocking] [Ria] Hey. I've got something you should see. So I went to all six Priox testing labs. I didn't get anything until I talked to the researcher at the lab... that did the 9,000-person study. - Did he show signs of deception leakage? - Yeah. He looked like he was about to hurl. So I came back... pulled a video of Vandeman talking about that study. Priox promises to help the millions living with diabetes. - An intensive 9,000-person study... - [Ria] Same lip bite. She does it every time she talks about that study. And given the depth and the breadth of this 9,000-person study... Just like today. She is totally freaked out. Yeah, well... she's not the only one. - [Ria] What? He's just staring at the floor. - Yeah, watch. [Cal] He looks at her when she's talking about the study... and then catches her eye, and then looks down and away. - Signs of... - Guilt. Yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. Where did you dig this up? I still remember you bounding into morning lab straight from the poker tables... having hustled some jackass out of a hundred pounds. Seems like a thousand years ago. Yeah, I could read you back then. Not as well as you thought. - What? - Spoke to Gunderson at the F.D.A. We know the 9,000-person study is a sham. So if you've got anything to say, you should say it now. - Cal, I have no idea what you're talking about. - She's selling a killer drug. We spoke to the testing labs. We watched her on tape. A'isha Ward was telling the truth about Priox. Vandeman's lying. Are you serious? Yeah. And I know you're helping her. - And you think that I would do something like that? - Tell me it's not true. - It's not true. - You're lying. I can see it in your face. - No, I'm not! - Yeah, you are. You're covering. - You are unbelievable. - I saw the guilty look you had when you watched Vandeman. You're involved in this. [Chuckles] There's no "this," Cal. Okay? Erica and I are having an affair. That's it. We're having an affair. Okay? You happy now? - You're cheating on Sarah? - Oh, you're gonna lecture me about marriage now? 'Cause you know what? That would be rich. You really had no idea she was manipulating the data? You know something? For somebody who's studied emotions their entire life... you really don't understand them at all. - You have to stay away from her, Jeffrey. - Okay. I mean it. This investigation's gonna get ugly. Erica's going to jail. You can't call her. You can't e-mail her. You can't be near her when that happens. I mean it. Stay away from her. Thanks for the friendly advice. Mr. Peters, I just got your message. I thought we had a deal. We have another proposal. There's only an hour until sentencing. Please, hear us out. I'm listening. In return for the pardon and release of Nicole and Marcus Braden... the United States is prepared to meet all of Yemen's humanitarian demands. This is an insult. Ambassador Rafik. To thank you for putting aside your military demands... we would like to show our gratitude. - What's this? - It's an invitation. - A state dinner. - Honoring the Republic of Yemen. Only leaders held in the highest esteem are hosted at the White House. The president's social secretary has a few dates in mind. And the chief of staff has assured me already that... you'll be seated beside the president himself. [Camera Shutter Clicking] - I almost forgot we had a date. - [Camera Shutter Clicking] We need to talk. - Jeffrey... - I think we should go to your office. Hey, how did you get Buchanan to go for this? You didn't tell him? I did not doctor the report. Then why is the 9,000-person study so perfect? Why are there no outliers? You and I both know every drug has side effects. But according to this, Priox has almost none at all. How is that possible? You doctored the report. We were behind. The drug had been promised to market. The stock price was falling. The board was all over me. What would you have done? Postponing the Priox launch... would've put Ribocore into bankruptcy. - I think we got enough, don't you? Shall we? - [Erica] We had two choices. Destroy the company, or put out the drug and hope for the best. - Hope for the best? - We have been working on a new pill. We've got the blood clotting under control. We're about to reintroduce Priox to market. If you can just buy me a few months... Buy you a few mon... Did you just say buy you a few months? What about Drew Coleman? What about the other victims? Tell me... I just need a few months. - [Door Opens] - [Man] Dr. Vandeman. - You're under arrest. - Sir, please step aside. [Jeffrey] Cal, what the hell's going on? You can drop it now, Jeffrey. F.B.I. have got what they want. I'm pulling Priox off the market immediately. Thanks for your help, Jeffrey. I prefer to get at the truth in person, but sometimes... you just have to make do. Yeah. Okay. [Clears Throat] [Cell Phone Closes] You should've told me, Cal. You should've warned me the feds were listening. I told you to stay away from her. What if I'd offered to protect her? What if I'd agreed? Nah. I knew you wouldn't. Oh, so now you have faith in me? [Chuckles] You know, I can count on one hand the number of people... I'd do anything for. You were one of 'em. I would've lied for you, Jeffrey. I wish I could believe that. [Male Announcer] And earlier this evening, the State Department... successfully convinced the Yemeni Government... to pardon and release Nicole and Marcus Braden. This is a proud, new step... in what we hope will continue to be... a productive friendship with the United States. [TV Shuts Off] Well, at least one of us had a good day. You saved his reputation. You kept him out of jail. Jeffrey will... come around eventually. I mean, you've known each other too long. [Cell Phone Rings] One second. Hi, honey. Yeah, I just got back to the office. Okay. Yeah, no, no. I... I... I understand. Do you want me to pick something up? All right. Well, just let me know if you change your mind. - Okay. - [Cell Phone Beeps] Alec stuck at work? We're almost on the right schedule. You know, I spend my days at the State Department, he spends his nights there. - You want to grab some dinner? - I'd love to. But I gotta take care of something. - Rain check? - Sure.
