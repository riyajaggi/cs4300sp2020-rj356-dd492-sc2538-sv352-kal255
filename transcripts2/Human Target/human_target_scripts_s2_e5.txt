 Human Target (2010–2011): Season 2, Episode 5 - Dead Head - full transcript 
 Winston is hell-bent on the team taking the case of an amnesiac John Doe, whom they call J.D., as he's threatened by a motor gang hired by dirty SFPD lieutenant Broward, who wrecked his own police career 8 years ago. As the investigation progresses, it becomes clear JD was a criminal himself and a coward, but he's the only way to hit Broward where it really hurts, his Caribean bribes and blackmail fruits bank accountant.

 This is ridiculous, running us all over the place like this. Let me tell you something-- this guy ain't here in the next five minutes, we walk. No, he'll be here. He's just spooked. Try the cannoli. I don't want to try the damn cannoli. I didn't want to try the sesame ball when he had us running all over Chinatown, or the empanada when he was supposed to meet us up there in the mission.

 Suit yourself, because the highlight of the day is the cannoli. You know, the guy wouldn't even tell me his name. And then over and over and over again about no cops, no cops-- that ain't a good start. You know who says stuff like that? Criminals say stuff like that. Look at it this way. If everybody went to the cops, we wouldn't have a job. The guy needs our help. He's nervous. You heard his voice. [Horn honks] What I heard was a guy running off at the mouth about everybody trying to kill him,

 from the Yakuza to the Russian mob to the street gangs... Sounds to me like a paranoid whack job. [Horn honking] Sounds to me like a client. What is your problem? Go around! Go around! [Winston chuckles] You believe this jackass? That's our client. He's wedged in there pretty good. I--I don't-- I don't know, I don't know. All right. [Grunting] Ah! It's not working. There's gas on the ground. We got no time! Hold it up. Come on, Chance. Hurry up. All right, don't move. Okay, okay. [Coughs] Come on. I'll get his leg. I got it. Let's go. (Man) They got him out! He's alive. You still think he's a paranoid whack job? Other than the head injury, he's physically stable. No broken bones, no internal injuries. We could discharge him, but only to a responsible party who can monitor his mental state. His mental state? Mm-hmm. Due to the head injury, his cognitive abilities have suffered. (Winston) Suffered, huh? He has what we call retrograde amnesia. You're kidding me. Can't remember anything that happened before the accident. Didn't even know who to call to pick him up. (Chance) How long till he recovers? There's no treatment. Only patience, therapy. Brain traumas are unpredictable. Could be hours, weeks, even years before he regains his memory. Can we talk to him? Mm-hmm. Sure. Wouldn't get your hopes up, though. Nurse. Hi, uh... Mr., um... Doe. We're the guys that rescued you from the burning car. Saved your life. My life. I'm sorry I didn't recognize you. It's just that I don't know who you are because I--I don't know who I am. I don't know where I live, if I'm married, if I--if I like jell-o. Actually, you know what, I'm pretty sure I don't like jell-o. But thank you for saving my life. So you don't know who's trying to kill you. Kill me? Someone's trying to kill me? That explosion wasn't an accident. - It was a car bomb. - A bomb? Someone tried to kill me? Who? Well, we were hoping you could help us with that. Wait a minute. What if they try again? I need some help. I need protection. Well, we know some people. ♪ Human Target 2x05 ♪ Dead Head Original Air Date on December 15, 2010 == sync, corrected by elderman == == for www.addic7ed.com == ♪ ♪ Here's the thing, John Doe. You mind if I call you "J.D."? - It's all right. - Okay, J.D. Here's the thing. Amnesia-- pretty hard to fake for a long con. You're gonna trip up sooner or later. I'm telling you the truth. I don't know who I am. Who would make something like that up? A criminal. Someone running from something, going to start a new life somewhere. My attorney has informed me that I've adopted an adult white male. When I'd laughed it off, he showed me some documentation-- signed. By me. At the risk of sounding like I don't know what's going on with my company, what the hell is going on? Well, you're actually a legal guardian. Technically, he's not adopted. No, see, we thought it would be best to get the client quickly to someplace where he'd feel protected. So the forgery was just the best way to get around all that hospital red tape. Yeah. Forgive me for mentioning the unthinkable, but instead of committing a felony, perhaps you'd consider the benefits of law enforcement? Oh, yeah, yeah, but see, before the accident, the client was very specific--no cops. That's the only thing we knew about him. All right. Oh, and, gentlemen, your paychecks. You'll note at the bottom my signature. Try and get it closer next time. I could be a good guy. People don't blow up good guys. I'm watching you. What are you doing? Nothing. Uh-huh. That the dead head? Just call him J.D. Okay. Hey, dudes. Hey. No hits on his prints. He's also not in the facial-recognition database, and the car he's-- rented to Dustin Hoffman. Yeah. Safe to assume that's an alias. But the car had a navigation system. J.D. over there spent the last couple days holed up in a hot sheet motel. Nice place to start. Any word on the bomb? Patience, brother. Car's still at the crime scene. If I can get a look at the blast signature, i can narrow down the threat list. Why is my full legal name printed on this envelope? Oh...Oh, see, that there is your paycheck. Paycheck? Mm. This some kind of joke? If you're referring to the amount, think of it as a signing bonus. Oh, and I still need that W2. No, it's not the amount. It's that this is not money. I only get paid in cash. I've never taken a check in my entire life. Look, men in my vocation can't afford being burnt by a paper trail. Do you know what this is? It's a license to steal. It's a map for thieves. Get your account number, they find your social. They find your social, they got you. Who are they, exactly? Well, uh, me... And men of my ilk. Well, as I've explained to your colleagues, I'm running a legitimate business here. So take your check. Deposit it in a secure banking facility. Report it to the Federal government, and... Wait for it... Pay taxes on it. Taxes? Taxes. You think I'm gonna-- S.F.P.D. Cops. To be continued. Hello, can I help you? Yeah, just need to ask a few questions. Why am I not surprised? [Buzzer] The police are here. I assume it's about my adult orphan. J.D. said no cops. I can hardly lie to the police. Why not? [Elevator dings] Lieutenant Broward, S.F.P.D. This is Detective Delgado. Ilsa Pucci. My associate, Mr. Chance. What can we do for you? Well, we're just following up on our bombing victim. I understand the hospital left him in your care. That's correct. We've taken guardianship of him. So you know him. Uh, who he is. (Chance) We're working on it. We were hoping you would have an identification on him. No, just following up. Routine. You mind if I talk to him? Yeah, we do. Our John Doe's been through a lot. We wouldn't want to risk getting him further traumatized. Winston... Been a long time. Not long enough, Detective Broward. It's actually Lieutenant Broward now. Whatever. Till a judge says otherwise, he's in our custody. No need to get territorial. Lieutenant Broward, let me assure you that if Mr. Doe remembers even the smallest detail, we'll inform you immediately. Do you have a card? It's a pleasure, Mrs. Pucci. All mine. Forgive me for prying, but there seemed to be more going on than just our client's protection. The guy's a crook. Okay? He and his team have been gaming the system for years. Money disappearing from drug busts, evidence gone missing. I knew the guy was dirty. Staked my reputation on proving it. I just never could. - So that was the guy. - Yeah. That was the guy. That guy cost me everything. My job, my reputation, my-- that close. Almost had him. Well, maybe you still can. He must want J.D. for a reason. We just figure out why and then we take him down. [Chuckles] (Chance) Okay, this is your last known address. Does it trigger anything? (J.D.) No, but it's not that bad. It looks like a good guy motel, doesn't it? Doesn't it? This place jog any memories? I guess I'm not the four seasons type. Whoa... J.D., what are you into? (Winston) Drugs, protection, banking. Any of this familiar to you? This doesn't mean I'm a bad guy. I swear, I don't remember doing a single illegal thing my entire life. I can still be a good person, right? (Ames) Tell it to the judge. (Winston) If you were a good person, Broward wouldn't want you so bad. Ames, you're the thief. Where do we start? No, if you really wanted to hide something, you'd put it somewhere no one else would look. When was the last time anyone staying in this motel used this? Huh? Anything? It's a key. I kno-- I got two damn eyes. Let's say we go to the office, check out the footage from the security camera. Yeah. Ames, keep an eye on him. And you...Try to have an epiphany, would you? Don't open that trunk. Step away from the vehicle, slowly. Who the hell are you? I'm the guy that's been chasing this sick bastard up and down the west coast. He always leaves a secondary device with a hairline trigger. I cannot chalk line any more corpses today, okay? Please? I'll let you work. Thanks. So you double up on caffeine today? I'm a little on edge. I just want to nail Broward, that's all. [Cell phone ringing] Talk to me. Hey, dude, I can't tell you who made the bomb, but the workmanship-- total amateur hour, dude. Listen, if we're thinking this guy's in trouble with the Russians or Yakuza... Doe would be dead. Those guys are pros. What about the Mongrels? They just got here. It could totally be those grease heads. I've got a couple contacts I can run down. Well, hit me back when you've got something. (Guerrero) Yeah, you got it, dude. Listen, when it comes to these guys, shoot first, ask questions later. Got it? Ready to go? Let's do this. Ames and J.D. are still in there. Room's in the back. Using an alias and renting some crappy motel room... Maybe I was a journalist or... Some kind of a whistle-blower. [Knock on door] Come on out. Yeah, you in there, come on out. J.D., if you were a meth dealer, now's the time to come clean. I'm not. I think.

I will shoot you! Drop it! [Police radio droning] I haven't seen you in eight years, and now it's twice in one day. Lucky me. Oh, you can't take him. That's my client. Heck of a job protecting him. This is a crime scene, and John Doe is under police protection. You remember the drill. I remember everything about the job. Don't worry, he ain't taking you. You know what, actually, I am worried. Which is why I've decided I'm going with the police. Be a little safer. See you around, Winston. [Cell phone rings] Yeah? Hey, dude. Ran into an old friend that runs with the Mongrels. Asked him why his buddies were after John Doe. He said they're not after him. They were hired to take out his protection...You. [Groaning] Dude... Do not bleed on the Eldo. Guerrero, hired by who? He claims he doesn't know. Three cracked ribs, I'm inclined to believe him. (Chance) Got it. Thanks. Somebody hired the Mongrels to take us out. "Somebody." It was him! Broward did this so he can grab J.D. Hiring a motorcycle gang to do your dirty work-- that's right out of Broward's playbook. If he wants this guy dead, nothing can save him. Let's just go get him. I can't believe I'm the one who's the voice of reason here. But...are you sure you want to do that? I've been waiting eight years for this. Let's go. Okay. (J.D.) First it's a car bomb, then it's a biker gang. I must have been on the cusp of exposing a major criminal enterprise. You can cut the act, old buddy. It's just me and you. You know who I am? Tell me. You really don't know who you are, do you? [Tires screech] Than I have no reason to keep you alive. What's going on? (Ames) Saving your ass again. Hiya. So I'm gonna need your car keys, your cell phone, and your gun. You're digging your own grave. I'm still a cop. Not for long. I'll get that badge off you later. You're going down, Winston. This time you're taking your whole team with you. Better keep your head low. There's a price on it. Put it on the bill. [Beep] Brilliant. Hello. How can I help you? Mrs. Ilsa Pucci, you and your associates are suspected of kidnapping a material witness from police custody. We have a warrant for your arrest. Could you just hang on a sec? I've got the kettle on. [Telephone ringing] Hello? You kidnapped John Doe from the police. It was really more of a rescue. Are the cops there? Yeah. The one from this morning. Mrs. Pucci, open the door now, please. He's with Broward. You need to get out of there now. Let them arrest me. My lawyers will have me out of there before my fingerprints dry. Ilsa, did you hear anything I said to you about these guys? These are not the regular cops, and they're not there to arrest you. They're gonna take you and hold you hostage, and force us to give them J.D. Get the hell out of there now. And what do you suggest I do? You wearing heels? Of course. Take them off. Mrs. Pucci... Mrs. Pucci! Miss-- she's in here somewhere. Find her. [Ding] [Phone line ringing] (Chance) Yeah? I'm out. Now what? Get yourself to a bus stop. I'm gonna have Guerrero come and pick you up. Ilsa Pucci's running from the law? So are we. (J.D.) I still can't believe that cop was gonna kill me. I want his name and badge number. I'm writing all this down in case I forget. Where'd you get this? At the motel. Why? "Store it Yourself Storage. Your extra clutter is our bread and butter." Wait a minute. Hold on a second. So that's what this key is for. Good. Maybe we can unlock some of the memories you've got stored over there. Whoa. Nice. (Chance) Looks more like a safe house. Derivatives... Credit default swaps... You understand any of this stuff? Who the hell understands that stuff? Damn it! The whole system's been wiped clean. Just like his damn brain. Jackpot! The odds of me being good are getting really bad, aren't they? J.D., I don't care what you did. No, this is a sign. You, me, a van full of cash, the open road... Hey! You want to, uh, roll your tongue back in your head, maybe step away from the van. I bet Broward would love to get his hands on this. We have a name. Everyone... David Jarecki. David Jarecki? David Jarecki... David Jarecki. David Jarecki. Hello, my name is David Jarecki. David Jarecki. David Jarecki. It's good to meet you. It's good to meet you. You can call me David. Dave...Davey. Big "d." D-man. D.J. All flooding back? No, no. It's my face and my name, but it means absolutely nothing. What is it gonna take for me to figure out who the hell I am? I'm gonna look myself up on the Internet. No, we could do better than that. We've got our own criminal search engine. [Cell phone rings] What's up, bro? Yeah, we're at the storage facility. Found a huge pile of cash and a name-- David Jarecki. Mean anything to you? David Jarecki? The laundry man? This guy's doing more than starching collars. No, no, dude. The laundry man. You're talking the most notorious money launderer on the West Coast. This guy can make millions disappear, then look legit days later. This guy's an artist. Thanks. [Man muttering] That could be you and me, girl. Get in. Not you, Hef. Well, it took you long enough. [Tires screech] (Pucci) Oh, God! I'm taking you someplace safe till this thing blows over. How about the ritz? I'll need a few things first. Shoes, for starters. No, no, I don't think you're fully grasping your situation here. You use a credit card, ATM-- you flash your I.D., that's like sending up a flare. No credit cards?  What did I tell you? Cash is king. Great. I suppose I'm gonna have to float you a loan now. A money launderer? Me? I just can't believe I was such a scumbag. That's why Broward wanted J.D., to wash his dirty money. Gets rid of J.D., protects himself. Mm-hmm. He's got something on Broward. If I can find out what it is, I can get him. Ames, I want you to tear this place apart until you find J.D.'s banking records. Where are you going? I gotta get something from my place. Whoa, whoa, you're not going home. The cops are gonna be waiting for you there. My old place. What, you're just gonna leave me here with a van full of cash? I trust you. How do you know the evidence we're looking for is still here? Because she's been trying to get me to take it out of here for I don't know how long. She? My ex-wife. Oh, so you were married. I told you. It was a long time ago when I--I told you. [Doorbell rings] You never told me. [Stammers] You know how you think you tell-- hello, Laverne. It's been a long time. Something tells me this isn't a social visit. Lovely home. Got it. Should have known you weren't back for your golf clubs. Thank you, Michelle. I thought you had thrown this stuff out. Sometimes it's best just to let things gather dust, instead of dragging them out again. Hey, something worthwhile, always worth a second chance. I'm finally gonna bring Broward down. Of course. Of course. Because it's comforting to know that people don't change. Hey, see? Look at this. Back then I used to write everything down. I always thought he might be funneling money offshore. I caught him online one time checking out a bank. See? First Barbados Federal. Problem was they don't give out their clients' names. They only use these anonymous account numbers, but-- if J.D.'S records match the bank's name and account number-- we get that dirty money. Laverne... Michelle... Cops just pulled up out front. (Chance) They must have followed us. Use the back door. I'll cover for you. [Doorbell rings] Thanks. Like I said, some things never change. I can't believe I haven't run off with your millions of dollars. Actually, it was over $10 million. $10,860,000, to be exact. You knew how much was there. You remembered something. I wish. No, I just added it in my head. Each stack of $100 bills is approximately 4/10 of an inch thick, and the pile was 18 inches high and three feet deep. It's simple math. Holy crap. You're a Rain Man. What? He had this super- photographic memory. He'd do, like, crazy math counting cards. And he was played by your alias, Dustin Hoffman. [Chuckles] At least I was good at something. Dude, do you know what this means? It means we're going to Vegas. [Chuckles] Tell me you got those bank records. Uh, bad news. There are no banking records. But the good news is we're about to go and drain the Bellagio of everything but its fountain. No records? What do you mean, no records? Are you sure? J.D. Has a photographic memory. A thing for numbers. He didn't need to keep records 'cause... They're in his head. You mean, they were in his head. He's got no memory now. So I've got no proof. I've got nothing! Nothing. This is my life. You understand? I spent my whole life going after this guy. Now you've just ruined it! (Ames) Lay off! It is not his fault! What are you doing? This isn't about him. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. I thought this was over eight years ago. And it's back now, and it's worse than ever now because I got everybody involved. And it's all for nothing. It's not for nothing. This is different now. Different how? You got us. (Winston) So what's the plan? Well... Broward wants the laundry man. Let's give him the laundry man. Um, no, just-- no, no, please, tell me you're joking. Keys to the Caddy? Thanks, dad. Listen... You are not a getaway driver. Your job is to make sure that we can walk out of there, and not in handcuffs. And as for the Eldo... One speck of pigeon crap... Nothing more needs to be said. You remember the plan? I bluff Broward into believing I remember who I am, and then I offer to pay him off. And? Bait him into giving me his offshore account number. We track the dirty money, then we nail him. The money better be in the bank. Trust me, Ilsa Pucci knows her way around a bank. Good afternoon. How may I assist you? I need to open an account. I'll be transferring money from my bank in Switzerland, and I need the funds to be accessible immediately. That's $2 million. There's a 24-hour hold on all transfers over $10,000. Standard protocol. Well, I'm not your standard customer. Perhaps this will expedite things. Of course... Mrs. Pucci. Rest assured that Grand Cayman Bank would love to assist you with all of your financial needs. But it's policy to put on a hold. Isn't there some way we can forget about all that red tape...Paul? You see, I plan on doing a lot of banking here. In fact, I can picture making this my central account. I can...Picture that. And imagine how impressive that would look if you were the one responsible for bringing in my business. Will not be a problem. Ilsa showed her I.D. They're running it through the system now. Flare's up. [Cell phone chimes] If he finds out I'm bluffing, I'm dead. Hi. Excuse me. I'm Christopher Chance. You're probably looking for me here. That all-points bulletin, all the points point to, well, me and my friend here. (Officer) Call the Lieutenant. (Guerrero) All right, the money's on its way. We're coming out, Ames. No, you're not. The cops just showed. Stay cool. The heat's outside. Do not let those cops get into this building. Yeah, what do you want me to do? I thought you could think in your feet, man. Do something, anything. I don't care. As long as you don't care. [Tires screech] Oops. I can't believe she smashed the Eldo. I'm so sorry. Put that away. Mrs. Pucci, hold it. You forgot your welcome packet. Tell me, Paul, you wouldn't happen to have a back exit, would you? Paparazzi. Oh... Right this way. Can I get arrested for this? Okay, you know what-- it was a total accident. [Beep, buzz] Gentlemen... Mr. Jarecki has regained his memory and would like to make a deal. That right, David? Here's my proposition. $2 million for my freedom. Secure transfer, immediately verifiable. Doesn't take a genius to figure out how long it would take to make that on the force. Why is he here? I'm just here to make sure he gets back alive. How noble. Well, it's self-interest, actually. The deal includes myself and my associates, so it's kind of a win-win situation. I can wire the money right now. I just need the account number. First...you show me the $2 million. See? There's the money. Come on, take it. Take it. Now just let me type in what account you'd like me to send it to. I can type it in myself. Come on. Take it, scumbag. [Tapping keyboard] Problem? You said you regained your memory, right? Yeah. So? Name the bar where we conduct business. [Chuckles] Of course I know the name of the bar. We never met in a bar, scumbag! Okay, take it easy. Okay, I don't remember anything. Those guys put me up to this. They wanted to set you up. We can still make a deal. I've got money. Real money. $10.8 million, cash. What are you doing? You're screwing up the plan. Cash. I'm listening. Where? In storage. I can take you there. All right. Let's go. Sorry, I had no choice. Clean up this mess. But keep it quiet. Okay, look, four against one? This is hardly fair. That's better. Put your hands up! Don't move! Freeze! [Man shouts] Oh, good, the police. All right. So are we good? I'm great. As for you, not one soul out there knows you, cares about you, or is gonna miss you. I don't know about that. Me and him, we kinda bonded. Show me your hands. See, the question is, who's gonna miss you when I.A.B. throws your ass in jail? Just like old times. Jumping the gun before you have enough to convict. I've got First Barbados Federal. That's all you got-- a bank name? You got nothing. Nothing? What do you say, J.D., nothing? Account number 5697124- 80155-94. I saw you type it on your keyboard. See, I got everything. Took me eight years. But now I've got enough to put you away for the next eight. And the next eight after that. Unh! [Gasping] Turn around, scumbag. Look at that. You see that? I told you I'd get that off of you. [Sirens approaching] Hear that? They're coming for you. Satisfied? No. I thought cash was king. You got any idea how much out of pocket I am? Your new shoes, your new suit. That lip junk you couldn't live a day without. Not to mention the damage to the Eldo. I could write you a check. Funny. Just add it to my next payday. Here. - I got you something. - Oh, a gift. How sweet. Paper? I figured if you insist on writing checks, you might as well be safe about it. Same paper the U.S. Treasury used to use. But not anymore. Uh, well, let's just say they ran into supply issues. How thoughtful. Thank you. You're welcome. So the cops aren't gonna arrest me? Well, we've assured them that in exchange for immunity and, uh, $10.8 million, that you'll cooperate with the investigation, and that, if your memory does recover... Well, yeah, I'd help in any way I can, of course. So you're free to be a new man. Well, not entirely. We agree that you should probably enter the Witness Protection program. Although Broward is locked up, some of your former clients may come after you. I could find another bomb in my car? I thought Broward was behind that. We tracked the purchase of the bomb ingredients to a hardware store. Yeah. Surveillance footage showed that you were the one that bought them. Me? [Chuckles] Why would I buy... It looks like you were planning on faking your own death. Just disappearing with your clients' cash. You hired us to protect you until you could make a dash. So I had to stay alive long enough to fake my death? But the bomb went off early. [Chuckles] Wow, I can't believe I was such a lowlife. I hate myself. No, you don't hate yourself. Come on, you hate the person that you used to be. I mean, with good reason. You've got a real opportunity here. Start a new life... Second chances don't come very often. You can trust us on that one. It may not mean much, given my history, but I'll never forget what you guys did for me. I hope. You back for those golf clubs? Michelle, I came here today to apologize to you. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry for everything that happened before. Before. When you stopped by a few days ago? Or when you checked out a few years ago? All of it. You remember what I went through eight years ago with Broward and all those dirty cops? Well, it really is over now. It's over. I got him. Thank you for helping me. I'm happy for you, Laverne, I really am. Oh, babe... I just know things would have been different between me and you if I'd have gotten him way back then. Laverne, if it wasn't Broward, it was a crime boss, some drug dealer, or some other bad guy you were consumed with taking down. You have a laser-like focus on whatever's in your sights. But that focus was never on us. I know. I'm sorry. You deserved better. We both did. [Rock music] ♪ ♪ ♪ oh, old man Chicago ♪ ♪ having his own fun ♪ ♪ living life if only... ♪ How'd it go?
