 Well, if it isn't the long-lost Ilsa Pucci. Hello, Connie. It's been almost a year... Not a phone call, nothing. Well, don't just stand there. Give your sister-in-law a hug so we can both go. Apologies for wanting to meet in the alley like this. Security, you know. And I'm sorry to drop in on such short notice. Oh, please. I'm thrilled you're here. And I hope you don't mind my asking to meet your new team.

 Of course not. You have every right to meet them. You're chairman of the board of my foundation. They're technically your employees. What? You're like a teenager who doesn't want daddy To meet her new friends. [scoffs] don't be absurd. I mean, these are men of skill, of--of character. They're professionals... Of the highest caliber. [elevator bell dings] [gun cocks] (Chance) okay, shoot me. Dear God.

 What are you doing here? What am I doing here? What are you doing? We just got some new body armor in the mail. I want to try it out. Try it out? Here? We can't do it outside. There's, you know, kids and stuff. Dude, we gonna do this or what? Yeah. Let's go. (Ilsa) didn't anyone Get my messages? That guy's not gonna call. Really? Five minutes. I leave you alone for five minutes. (Ilsa) well, hard to see How that could have gone any worse. Gentlemen, This is my sister-in-law Connie... Marshall's sister. She's treating me To the opera tonight. Connie, this is the team. How you doing? Hi. Hi. Good. Well, perhaps we could end humiliation there, Retire to my office. Listen, by the way, Mrs. Pucci, You still gonna need that security escort We talked about? You asked for an escort? I just had a scare a couple of nights ago. I thought someone was following me. You saw someone? Well, no. On second thought, Mr. Winston, That won't be necessary. I think I was just imagining things. You sure? Yes. Quite sure. Besides, Mr. Patrick From Connie's security detail Will be joining us. So I'm sure there won't be a problem. (Guerrero) wow. Sister-in-law's smoking hot. What? Boss lady seems kind of frazzled, Don't you think? Well, what do you expect After that... Incident... At her apartment with that Lopez maniac? And then she brings Her sister-in-law down here to meet all of us. And what does she get? You two taking target practice on each other. I can see it in your face, Connie. The board disapproves of what I'm doing here. Car chases and shootouts Don't exactly fit our mission statement. They're worried you might be out of your depth. So they sent you to check up on me? Nobody sent me to do anything. Do you know when the last time was that we saw each other? Not offhand. I mean-- It was Marshall's funeral. Even though he's gone, I still consider you family, Ilsa. And the only reason I'm here Is to make sure you're okay. I'm fine... Honestly. I'm in good hands here. How's it going? So is there any particular reason Why you're tagging along tonight? Come on, a little shoptalk. Someone hacked the firewall Around the Opera House security system last night. Really? You guys check that out? Of course. Ten-second breach-- Probably some paparazzi Trying to peek at the guest list. But after her brother's death, we don't take any chances. I'm sorry. You said it was a ten-second breach? That's right. You sure it wasn't fifteen? I don't know. Maybe it was. Are we done now? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Have fun. Guerrero, let's do this. [classical music] ♪ ♪ Well, what do you think? The concept is interesting. Ilsa, the chandelier. It's from Marshall's collection. We donated it To the production in his name. Doesn't it look magnificent? It does, Connie, truly. Are you sure everything's all right? I think I'm just a bit overworked. Then a night out is just what you need. (Ilsa) speaking of work, About earlier-- oh, Ilsa, relax. I expected your new employees To be somewhat unconventional. I'm glad to know they delivered. Especially Mr. Chance. I imagine he cleans up rather nicely. I wouldn't know. Well, uh, I suppose you're about to find out. Why in God's name are you here? Same reason you're here-- to see the show. Guerrero says it's fantastic. You know La Traviata? All right, I'm not gonna lie. If I have to sit through this baroque stuff, I much prefer Rossini. Will you excuse us a moment? I heard someone's Got box seats in venice-- Sweet. Love to join you sometime. All right, Mr. Chance, why are you really here? I want the truth this time. I told you. I'm here to see la tortellini. That's a type of pasta. Is it? Next, you'll tell me you have Mr. Winston outside In the surveillance truck And that Miss Ames is working the concession stand. Well, you're right on the first one. Ames called, says she's sick in bed. But I'm pretty sure I heard slot machines in the background. I want to know what's happening, and I want to know now. [sighs] look, it's nothing. Nothing? Well, it's nothing that I know of. I just got a bad feeling. Based on? Connie's security guy said there was a ten-second breach In the firewall last night. Ten seconds? Ten seconds. [scoffs] Sounds minor. Ten seconds is a perfectly harmless amount of time For a firewall to be down. Seconds-- That's something different. (Chance) in those five seconds, On this system, somebody who knew their stuff Could break in and make a copy of the whole mainframe. You do that, you hijack the security system, Shut down the cameras, open up any door, And take control of the whole place. And that's it? That's why you came along? Well, look, I know it's pretty thin, but-- Thin, Mr. Chance, is being generous. You may not be aware, But I'm under an intense amount of scrutiny at the moment. And while I appreciate your concern For my safety, given... Recent events, There simply couldn't be a worse time For you to indulge in this kind of rampant speculation. Everyone on the ground! [gunfire] Get on the ground now! [crowd screams] Get down now! [guns cocking] don't move! You heard me. Just do what I tell you! I hate it when I'm right. sync and corrected by www.addic7ed.com Human Target - Season 2, Episode 9 "Imbroglio" [devices beeping] What is that? Plastic explosives-- they're sealing us in. [whispers] Patrick, do something. I wouldn't. These guys are for real. So am I. This should be fun, dude. Hope you provide medical. (male voice over pa) ladies and gentlemen, I regret to inform you That there has been a change in the night's proceedings. Winston, you getting this? Oh, man, I hate it when you're right. (man over pa) among you are some of the wealthiest, Most influential people in the country, People whose families Will pay a considerable sum for their safe release. If you're wondering why we're here, You have your answer. I like to create an atmosphere of trust. Do as we say, and you will not be harmed. Resist us, And we will be forced to do this. [gun clicks] [people gasp and shriek] Consider this the dress rehearsal. Great. The next one will be real. Is the basement team in place? Yes. And on schedule. Separate the hostages. I'm going to go down there. Move. Move. What do you think? Kidnapping in bulk-- Not the worst thing I've heard. I'm just not buying the ransom thing. This place has an endowment, right--couple of million? More like $250 million. Why? I'm just thinking if you're smart enough To hack into the mainframe, Why not just figure out a way to steal the money And save yourself the trouble? If it isn't money they're after, What are they doing here? We're gonna find out. What does that mean, "find out"? (man) let's go, people. Keep walking. Stay with your group. (man #2) you heard him! Take the stairs now! (Chance) if we get stuck in here, we're not gonna get any answers. What are you thinking? Oh, man. I would keep your distance. Great. Ilsa, what's he doing? I don't like this. Relax, Connie. Relax? You saw what they did to Patrick. You're about to see why I hired this man, Why he's in a class of his own, and why no one-- Isn't that right, Guerrero? Oh, yeah. Why? What is he going to do? He's gonna puke. [vomits] Oh, lord. Ah. I wish to God someone would explain to me What is going on. Well, you know how some people have perfect pitch, Others can see well at night? Well... Chance can vomit on cue. Hey. Come on, let's go. Yes, but why, Guerrero? Why is he vomiting? Because now it's one-on-one. You get it? Yeah, go on. Move it. Let's go. [groans] ah, come on. Keep going. Unh! What the hell happened? [people screaming] Did you wash your hands first? Brilliant work. See? Nothing to worry about. (Guerrero) sorry, folks, It's gonna be a little longer. Just stay in your seats. Only if Mr. Chance plans to get us To the nearest exit as soon as possible. That is your plan, correct? No. Why not? 'cause the doors Are wired with explosives. Even if we could disarm them, There's a room full of other hostages. Well, his plan is to just sit here And do nothing? Not just sit here. We have to figure out what they want. Then we use that to leverage to get the hostages free safely. Winston, you with me? I've been listening to you heave For the last ten minutes. Why would I go anywhere? Look, I heard some radio squawk on the terrorists About something going on in the basement. That seems to be where the action is. Can you listen in on that? Let me move these mics around, see what I can get. [rhythmic noise] Oh, we got something. And I mean, if I can pick it up from here, It must be damn loud. The generator? It sounds more like drilling. [rhythmic noise] Maybe we're looking at this the wrong way. Remember the job you had in modesto? Uh-uh. No. No. He is not gonna set somebody on fire. No, no, no. The one before that. Yeah. Can someone please translate? Long story short, I had to get Something very valuable out of someplace very secure, And the front door wasn't an option, so-- So he rented the building next door. He dug underneath and then across. Yeah. It's one of my finer moments. The point being, maybe what they're after Isn't in the Opera House. All right, I'm just gonna look and see what's nearby here. Okay. We got apartment buildings. We got office towers, not really much to go on. I guess you know what that means, right? I got to go in the basement and see what they're up to. All right, hang on. Let me pull up a floor plan on my skydrive. Don't want you getting cornered. [banging on van] Uh-oh. What? FBI. Come out of the van with your hands in the air. Somebody call 911? Dude. What? [guns cocking] (man) hands where we can see them. Relax. We're being held by armed thugs. Why wouldn't I call the police? Hey, it's okay. We all make mistakes. (Chance) I'm just gonna have to find My way around the basement alone. Not necessarily-- I could go with you. What? I've been coming to this place for years. I know the layout well. Ilsa, what are you you thinking? I'm thinking about the best way to free the hostages. Look, I know there are risks involved, But the way I see it-- nobody cares about the way you see it. You're not the operative. You just have to stay here. And in light of recent events, I don't think you're up to this. Mr. Chance, I'm fine. And I'd prefer not to have this argument right now. Me too. She stays. Have a seat, boss. Is he serious? No. I'm missing the opera right now. You don't want to test me. Sit down. [gun cocks] You too, sweetie. [indistinct chatter] [sirens wailing] Just wait here. (man) I needed that team here an hour ago! Get those cars out of here! Chance, you there? Winston, you all right? Thought I lost you there for a second. Yeah, listen, I'm kind of in a bit of a fix. I'm gonna need your help. This the guy from the van? Why is he not wearing cuffs? Dhs? Yeah, that's right. You think I'm an idiot. This is a power grab. You want to muscle in on my operation. I don't know who sent you here. But whoever it was, I'm about to have their ass. I'm calling your supervisor. [chuckles] you think so. Let me tell you something, young fella. I'm about to have your ass. Who are you calling? Oh, you don't want to know. Oh, I see what you're doing. You want me to give you the name of that guy at DHS, right? That lunatic that everybody at the Bureau Is afraid of? Mm-hmm. Well, rest easy, pal. I'm here to help. You've always been there for me. Time for me to return the favor. Teamwork. Oh, yeah, I'll hold. Transfer me to the supervisor. Oh, what was that guy's name? It begins with a "c" or a "t." It rhymes with an animal. Get on with it, would you? Clea--cheaver. Yeah, this is Farrell, DHS. Get me Special Agent Cheaver, please. (woman) sir, is this, uh, Absolutely necessary? On second thought... Hang on. Uh, I'm sorry. What? Maybe we can work together on this. Oh, okay. I could clear you a desk. Oh, yeah, clear me a desk. That's good. That's good. Nice teamwork, pal. Thanks. So where are you, anyway? I'm under the Opera House. It looks like we were right. Terrorists hammered their way into the sewers. What about Ilsa and Connie? Are they okay? Oh, don't worry. They're in good hands. [people chattering softly] (Connie) "professionals of the highest caliber"? What if your professionals end up getting us killed? [soft chatter continues indistinctly] [breathing, grunting] [chatter on police radio] I don't understand. How can he hold a gun on you? I thought he was your employee. He's more of a freelance, really. What was that Mr. Chance was saying about recent events? Have you been in some sort of danger before this? Connie. Come on, Ilsa. I think I deserve to know the truth. Okay, well... There was this situation... Some maniac broke into her apartment. It was a random thing. Security caught him. It's not big deal. Maybe the board was right. Right about what? Earlier when I said they had concerns, I was being diplomatic. The truth is, they think you've completely lost sight Of Marshall's mission. They want to take a vote straight away To remove you as head of the foundation. All right, sounds like you guys could use a moment. I'm warning you, though-- keep it civil. Lost sight of Marshall's mission? But you don't honestly believe that. Is that why there's no sign of him anywhere in your office, Not even a picture? You do agree with them? I defended you. I said things can't be as bad as they looked. Turns out they're worse. Even if we manage to get through this night alive, You have got to promise me that you will sever all ties With these people. Otherwise you leave me no choice. Winston, I think I got something. [loud whirring] We were right again. They're drilling up into the surface. We got to find out what's nearby That's worth killing for. All right, give me your location. I'm about 150 meters northeast of the Opera House. That's underneath some-- some office buildings. Hold on a second. Hey, kid, do me a favor. N me a search on an address. 5566 Kearny Street. Vance, come here, would you? Why can't I see in that building? I think it's pretty obvious. It's a C.I.A. facility. We don't have clearance. Well, that's a problem. Well, I don't know what to tell you. We're blocked out. There's nothing I can do. Well, actually-- Sanford, don't even think about it. Hang on a second, would you? Go ahead, kid. I could run an intrusion script. Got it on my personal laptop. Get us through in a couple seconds. And break about five federal statut in n ehprocess. No, thank you. No way. Hang on a second. Now, I've been on this case longer than you have, Vance. And I got a hunch whatever these guys are after Is in that building. A hunch? Vance, in this job, Sometimes when you want to do the right thing, You're gonna have to throw out the rule book, okay? Now, you need to make up your mind. What do you want to do? You want to save lives, or you want to save your career? Go ahead. (Winston) here it is. "Special Prisoners Division." This is some kind of safe house. There's a phone number right there. You need to call it right now. Vance. You got a high-profile prisoner Two blocks away From this hostage situation at the Opera House. What more do you need? They're on the move. Clock's ticking, Vance. Come on. We're running out of time. They're patching me through now. [line ringing] [cell phone ringing] [cell phone beeps] Good to see you again... Brother. No answer. I think we're too late. All right, time for plan "b." (Winston) all right, listen up. We need to find out the name of that prisoner, Like, right now. Pulling up the file now. His name's Victor Rosko-- Ex-chechnyan army turned weapons dealer. Works with his brother Eli. C.I.A. caught them selling suitcase nukes, But Eli slipped away. (Winston) well, I guess we know Who's got the Opera House, then. Sir, can I talk to you in private? What is it? I called DHS to get temporary permissions For our friend over there. Guess what they told me. Agent farrell. Yeah. That is your name, right? Yes, Vance, why? Because according to your office, You retired six months ago... To Aruba. (man over radio) we're moving out of the tunnel now. [radio beeps] Hey! Get him! Get him now! What's happening? [distant gunfire] Not sure. [distant gunfire] Ugh! [crowd screams] Hold it. All right, fellas, Only gonna say this once-- Walk away now, nobody gets hurt. Winston, I've been spotted. They got me cornered. Ugh! (Eli) no more shooting! [Chance grunts] You have made too much noise as is. I'm terribly sorry To do this. But you have destroyed Our atmosphere of trust. Good-bye. Winston... We got a situation. I can't talk right now. Guerrero. Anybody there? (Chance) Guerrero. Where are you? (Guerrero) little busy, dude. What's happening? Chance is in trouble. Ilsa, what are you thinking? Stay here. Are you insane? You can't go out there. You want my decision. You have it. Give my regards to the board. Mr. Chance... I'm coming to you. Ilsa, no. Don't come down here. (man) come on. Give me a hand. This way. I'm sorry, Mr. Chance. It appears I'm all you've got. Ilsa, what are y doing here? What am I doing here? I'm helping you. I don't need any help. I can figure my way out of this myself, thank you. How exactly? That's not the point. The point is-- You're the operative, and I'm not. Can we please stop worrying about me For a change? Do you have any experience picking locks, By any chance? If I say yes, would it at least make you feel better? Throw out the rule book, huh? Hey, I'm the least of your problems. What are you gonna do about Rosko? We forced him back into the Opera House. He's trapped. Maybe he wants you To think he's trapped. You ever think about that? Sir, it's them. This is Agent Vance of the F.B.I. Who am I talking to? This is the man in control of the Opera House. [over speaker] I don't know How you managed to trap us, But I suppose congratulations are in order. In any event, I'm forced to change our exit plan. So here's what will happen now. You will deliver a helicopter to the roof of the Opera House. At the same time, I will move the hostages Down to the lobby. When my men and I are safely away, The hostages will be released. Sounds reasonable. I just have to clear it with my superiors. Fine, yes. Do I need to remind you that the explosives Around the Opera House are still armed? Any attempt To enter will cost you... Dearly. Trace the location of that cell phone number. He's playing you, Vance. As soon as the wagon arrives, Put him in it. You're looking considerably better. [man screams] what happened? My nose-- he bit my nose. Even tied up, you are a problem for me. What is your name? Guerrero. [whispering] Guerrero. Oh. [opera music] It seems that some of my men Are familiar with you. Perhaps you should consider that. Cut me loose. I, uh, think not, Mr. Guerrero. My production Is almost finished. And I think You have earned yourself... The starring role. Bloody thing. [metal bangs] What? I think somebody's coming. Okay, that settles it. Get out of here now. But you'll drown. What would you do in this situation? What do you mean "what would I do in this situation"? Just tell me as succinctly as possible How you would rescue you, And I'll attempt to do the same. What other choice do we have? I'd jump the guy. Jump him? Is that the best you can come up with? Yes, that's it. As far as I can tell, surprise is the only advantage you have. So grab something heavy and hide over there in the corner Near those pipes. When he walks by, clean his clock. He's likely to have a gun. Yeah, probably. What do you think the odds are-- Ilsa! [gasps] Hello. [gun cocks] There's really no need for that. Okay, Ilsa... I need you to pick up the gun. You have to shoot the lock. You can do this, Ilsa. That was so stupid! Stupid? It was your idea. And in case you haven't noticed, It appears to have saved your life. Well, you're not supposed to save my life. I'm supposed to save yours. What do you mean by that? Huh? Come on. We've got a room full of hostages to rescue. All right, move it, people. This is all about to end. You're all going to be leaving. Keep moving. That's the last of them. What's happening? Looks like they're getting ready To release the hostages. But why now? I don't know.. But I got another bad feeling. [chatter on police radio] Winston, are you there? Yeah, I'm still here. Just don't ask me to use my hands. We're in the lobby. All the hostages are here. It looks like the terrorists are trying to blend in with them. (woman) sir, we got a lock On that phone-- Top floor, northeast corner. Hang on. Are you sure? I'm looking right at them. They're just waiting there on the top floor. If those aren't the terrorists, Then who the hell are they? Guerrero. Guerrero. Tell the snipers to go weapons hot. We're gonna take them out. (Winston) Chance, this is a setup. They're trying to bait the F.B.I. Into shooting those hostages. Once that happens-- They're just gonna open up the lobby doors And walk right out with the rest of us. By the time the FBI realizes That innocent people have been shot, These bad guys are gonna be long gone. Winston, any way you can buy me some time? I'll do my best. Connie. Ilsa, thank God you're all right. Everything's gonna be fine. We're gonna be released. About that-- [gunfire and screams] Sorry, folks, nobody's going anywhere right now. Back up the stairs now. [gunfire] What is he doing? (Ilsa) I'll explain later. Right now I need your help. Anyone you recognize, Move them out of the lobby. (Chance) everybody remain calm. Everything's under control. We're all professionals here. (Winston) watch your back up there, Chance. Without those masks, You won't be able to tell who's who. (Eli) take him out. [crowd screams] [gasps] that was my husband! Okay, listen, folks, it's gonna be really hard For me to tell who I'm supposed to be fighting. So if you can do me a huge favor, Just raise your hand if you're a terrorist. [la donna e mobile playing] ♪ ♪ Sir, they've wired the building to blow. Protocol says we take the shot. I know the protocol. And so does Victor! Don't you see that? You're a part of his plan, Vance. You have been from the beginning. What are you talking about? Listen to me, Vance, use your head. What do you think is gonna happen When the smoke clears And you find out you shot eight innocent people And let the bad guys get away? Sir, we need your order. Wait, wait, wait. Look, look, look, look. What's he doing? That looks like Morse code. "don't shoot. "not terrorists. It's me, double wide." Who the hell is double wide? [mutters] wiseass. It's me. I'm double wide. It's my guy in there. Radio the snipers. Tell them to stand down. Sir, if those aren't the terrorists, Where are they? ♪ ♪ [gasps] Chance! Follow us, and they die. We will leave through the back alley. Hold on a second. Perhaps I wasn't clear before. Oh, you made yourself clear. My odds just improved a little bit. Sa, if this doesn't work out, I just want to apologize for what I've done To Marshall's memory. (Connie) oh, God. He's gonna do something crazy, isn't he? (Chance) Ilsa, now! (Eli) shoot him! Unh! Aah! [crystals clinking] Oh, Ilsa. It's over. [sighs] [Chance grunts] Okay, little help. Is there a ladder somewhere? [grunts] [overlapping chatter] Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Just doing my job. [cell phone beeps] Well, well, well, look at you. Don'y u look happy. Saved the hostages, caught the terrorists, And I got you. So who are you really? I'm just a concerned citizen, man. [keys jingle] Well, you saved my ass. A guy told me once Sometimes to do the right thing, You got to throw out the rule book. Wiseass. Are you sure you can't stay longer? I'm afraid so. I'm due before the board in the morning. They're waiting for my decision. Marshall once told me That you were the toughest person he'd ever met. You could do anything if you set your mind to it. Did he? He's right. Whatever I may think of your methods... You and your team saved those people tonight. You saved me. That should make a persuasive argument to the board. So you're standing by me? Like I said, you're family. I'm sorry for thinking you'd forgotten about Marshall. You know that's not possible. [button bell chimes] [elevator bell dings] Oh, hey. Oh. Leaving already? Afraid so. Thank you, Mr. Guerrero, for everything you've done. You bet. So we're on for Venice, then, right? [chuckles] Can't wait. So you heading home? Are you going for a jog? Yeah. It's a nice enough night out. You should probably know there's construction On market street. So I'll be taking 3rd Avenue tonight. Why do you think I need to know that? Mr. Chance, I know it's you Who's been following me home at night. But it wasn't clear to me until that moment in the sewer. You feel responsible for what happened to me-- For me being attacked. But you shouldn't feel responsible. It's not your fault. And the truth of the matter is... I'm fine. You're a strong person, Ilsa. Nobody's denying that. But taking someone's life Is something you can't just push out of your head. I know what it's like, And I know what you're going through. I know it's not easy. But I want you to know That you don't have to face it alone. Thank you. That means a lot. I can still follow you home, though. I need the exercise. No. You've done enough... Damage. Good. I don't like jogging anyway. Sync and corrected by www.addic7ed.com hank you. That means a
