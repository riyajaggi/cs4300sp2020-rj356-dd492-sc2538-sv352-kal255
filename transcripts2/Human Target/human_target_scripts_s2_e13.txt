 ♪ ♪ Marshall, are you having an affair? What? I've been calling for hours. If this is the end of it, just tell me and I'll save myself a trip to Africa. It's never gonna be the end of it. Sorry, but you're stuck with me forever. But I don't think you should come to Africa with me. Oh, don't be silly. I was only joking. Excuse me, driver,

 i think we should have turned right just then. Marshall, is everything all right? Marshall? Marshall, what's going on? Driver. Driver! Marshall? Marshall, can you hear me? Darling, I love you. Never forget that. You're not answering your phone. Marshall had an affair. Had I never seen that photograph, I'd never have known it. He and I had a good life together.

 We were happy together. I should be able to remember him like that, shouldn't I? Yeah, you should. And for what it's worth, you deserve a lot better than that. ♪ ♪ Uh, listen, I didn't-- It's okay. It's under control. Yeah. Good night. Good night. ♪ ♪ So does anybody other than me find any of this to be a bit strange? Yeah, with her dough, she's a little short on the caviar. I was talking about Ilsa moving back to London. She didn't talk about this with you? No, I think it's a great idea though. It's about time. Really? Yeah, she kinda wore out her welcome if you ask me. So did something happen between the two of you that I don't know about? What, you have another fight? I know why she's leaving. It's obvious. What, you guys need me to break it down for you? The man she loved was cheating on her, and we-- He botched the assignment, so... Excuse me? The girl was Marshall's mistress, flavor of the week. End of story. Maybe but you never found her. Was that not the gig, to find her? People end up gone all the time, bodies never found. Want me to educate you? Touchy. Sorry. I was just trying to clarify to the male element of this room why a woman would run away. And why is that? Love. It's usually because of love. Well, unlikely as it may seem, I think you might be wrong on this one occasion. The reason I'm going back to London is that I have to work full-time for the foundation there. Sometimes people can do more good when they're apart. Anyway, I would like to thank you all for your hard work and your courage and most of all for putting up with me. So... Cheers. Well, I'll be in touch. Is that it? No hugs? She just ups and leaves? Kinda cold if you ask me. Does anyone mind if I take the rest of this food in a doggy bag? Cool. She wanted us to ask her to stay. So why didn't you ask her? Let me rephrase. She wanted you to ask her to stay. She doesn't listen to anything I say. Plus she's got this charity in London. Seems legit to me. Mm-hmm. Something you're not saying? No, but there's something you're not saying. You do realize that just because we're men doesn't mean we can't talk about our feelings? Yes, it does. Oh, that's good then. Just keep it all balled up like a knot, just... Well, it's too late now anyway. She's already gone, caveman. Oprah. Why are you following me? I was gonna ask the same question. I'm Julia. Ilsa found the file on Marshall Pucci. Who's the woman? You mean, who's the mistress? I know who you are. What do you want? Protection. Mr. Chance, what are you doing here? We found her. Found who? Marshall's mistress. Good-bye, Mr. Chance. She knows who really killed your husband. ♪ Human target 2x13 ♪ Marshall Pucci Original Air Date on February 9, 2011 == sync, corrected by elderman == == for www.addic7ed.com == ♪ ♪ So you worked for Marshall's medical program in Africa? Couldn't find an aid worker? You're losing your touch. What happened? Marshall found a cache of guns in one of our shipments. So someone was using the program as a cover for illegal weapons trade. He traced the weapons to their source, took photographs. And they found out that we were gonna blow the whistle, and that's when Marshall was killed. We know how it ended. So who did it? I don't know who did it. They're on the pictures. I thought you found them, and that's why you came looking for me. We don't have 'em. Oh, not true. We did find a picture. Of you and Marshall at a bar. Not in Africa, but at the Lamont Hotel. That was the last time I saw him alive. I told you I'd make everything okay. And I am. Under the newspaper is a plane ticket to Prague. Take it. There's also some money. Stay hidden. I'll be in touch when it's safe. But they'll come after you. Think about your wife. Always. Ever since that day, I've been on the run. Moving every ten days, changing names, living in dingy motels and worse. And your relationship to my husband was... Purely professional? Are you kidding? Marshall loved you more than anything. He was the most decent man I've ever known. Don't you know that? Mrs. Pucci, I have a family too. I just want to go home. How sure are you she was Marshall's mistress? Less than definite. Both of our lives have been ruined by these people. We can't get my life back, but we can get yours. And that's what we're gonna do. Ilsa-- Mr. Chance, I know what you're gonna say. You think looking into Marshall's death is a bad idea. That's not it. You think I'm acting emotionally, that I should leave the missions up to the professionals. Closer, still not it. All right then, enlighten me. These people killed one of the richest men in the world, and they covered it up. Evidence vanishing, no witnesses, complete control of the environment. Isn't that your credo, take the fight to them and then you race in and do something breathtakingly heroic. It doesn't always work that way. Is this because you're worried about me? Be honest, Mr. Chance. Honestly, if we're going up against the people that killed your husband, I'm worried about us all. Listen, Julia's got a phone number. They've been leaving threatening messages. What do you wanna do? Call them and set up a meet. See, it doesn't matter what I say. She's got a mind of her own. Everybody in position? We're here, dude. Got eyes on Ilsa and Julia? Guerrero, do you have a visual? Yeah, I see her. Yeah, sure, now you see her. Do you want to speak to the last person that pushed my buttons? No. Good, 'cause you can't. Winston, you into the satellite feed? Yeah, I got eyes on Ilsa and Julia. They're sitting ducks on that bench, people. Everyone on alert. I'm really nervous. Are they gonna try and kill me? Well, that's what we're hoping, but don't worry. I'm not gonna leave your side, okay? Look, something just ain't right here. What? What is it? What? What are you seeing? The street musician only knows about two chords. These guys playing chess, either they don't know how to play or they're stoned. This bum asking for change has got a pretty good dental plan for a homeless guy. Good call on the chess. Those guys are imbeciles. Looks like they got the park covered. What do you wanna do? We're too exposed. I don't like it. Let's pack it in. Mr. Chance, is that really necessary? It's him. They're calling. Ilsa, no, do not answer the-- Mr. Chance, hello? What do we do? It's him, the man who killed Marshall. Ilsa, can you hear me? Do not answer the phone. Hello? Earwig is out. She's on the phone. Winston, can you get a trace? I keep getting bounce-back. Meeting spot's changed. Go down the Bart station behind you. I'll be in the last car. Winston? They have a firewall they're using. It must be high-level. Everyone in position? We're set. All right, they got two in the Cadillac, one in their office, one on the park bench. On my command, cue the bus, kill the rest of their communication. Yes, sir. Got it. Now. I just lost my visual. A bus pulled up. Chance! Winston, could you hear me? Come on. No, no, no, no! What should we do? If we don't show, he may never come back. Let's go. Mr. Chance, if you can hear me, we're going into the subway. Follow us. Damn it. What is she doing? Let's go. Cue the traffic light. Now. Hey, are you two all right? Ilsa! Ilsa, wait. What the-- shoot him. Mr. Chance, we're in the subway. Can you hear me now? We may have temporarily lost our protection, but you'll be fine, I promise. Too bad the same can't be said for you. Turn around and walk to the back now. Where are the pictures? I told you, I don't have them. Ilsa, if I thought that was true, you think you'd still be alive? So every word out of your mouth has been a complete lie. Don't worry, Marshall fell for it too. Now what do you know about my boss? Your boss? Is he the one who killed Marshall? You mean pulled the trigger? No. I did that. Ilsa, get to the other track! I can't move! For once listen to me. Don't move. You okay? No. No, I'm not. I don't get it. So that whole "I'm an innocent aid worker" thing-- that was a cover story, Ames. She conned us. Just like she conned Marshall, and then she killed him. Then who the hell is she? Seems like they knew every move we made. They cut off our communication. They hacked into traffic lights, dude. That's pro style. Are you two thinking what I'm thinking? We're in a world of hurt. We gotta get out of here. Sir, we've lost the feed. They're onto us. Bravo party, move in. Go, go, go. Go, go. Move! Everybody clear! They're not here, ma'am. Couldn't have gone far. Find them now! The CIA? No way. I don't understand. What would the CIA want with Marshall? Marshall discovered that they were exploiting his program. And so they killed him? It's not the entire agency. Julia was asking about her boss. It's a single rogue Agent. I want eyes on every airport, every train station, everyone who's ever associated with these people. Do they have family? Find their pressure points. Not a betting man, but I'd wager they don't see the sun come u up. So what are we gonna do? We run. What are we doing? We should be halfway to Mexico by now. The CIA is after us, all right? Have you ever heard of satellites? I can't believe that I'm going on the lam with you. Look, I want to go somewhere hot and not humid, 'cause my hair curls. And I really want to get a dog, 'cause then I'll have someone to talk to. Ooh, and a soaking tub. We gotta get something straight. We get out of the country, it's adios, kid. You're on your own. Well, I don't know anyone out of the country. Who am I gonna hang out with? Like, watch TV with? Eat with? Look, I'm not psyched about this either, but like it or not, you're stuck with me now. All right. Where are we going? Back to the office to settle this. The CIA is there! Hello, they're gonna kill us! Better than a life with you. Ugh. I can't believe this is happening. Now all of your lives are in danger because of me, because I couldn't leave well enough alone with that stupid photograph. Here, take this. It's not your fault, you were right. There was more to your husband's death. As for us being in danger, well, it's sort of the gig we signed up for. Not this. They can hunt us down anywhere. There's nowhere we're gonna be safe. Finally a fair fight. Now look, your husband had the evidence that could put these people away. If we find that, maybe we can get out of this mess. Plus they think you have it. I don't. He hid all of this from me. Why? I was his wife. Maybe he thought I couldn't handle it. I guess he was right. Okay, listen to me. I don't think I've ever met anyone quite as strong as you are. It seems to me that Marshall is a pretty smart guy. I can only assume he felt the same way. Why didn't he tell me? Maybe he did. You just didn't realize it. Ilsa, I need you to tell me everything about your relationship with your husband. What you're asking me to do is gonna be very difficult. Come on, it's just me. That's why it's gonna be difficult. Look, I went heavy on the canned fish, and I don't wanna hear any crap about Mercury from... You two. Uh... I'm gonna go out to the van and check on those mics, and maybe I can recalibrate them or something. Okay, who's got the files on these other losers? This is crazy. I thought you told Ilsa you'd stop spying on everyone. It's like you don't even know me. Criminals and a has-been cop. Wasn't there another guy? His name's Guerrero. Some pretty scary reading. Wow. We're doing society a favor putting this freak out of his misery. Says here he has a kid. See? That's what I mean by a pressure point. Oh. Ames. I knew about the kid. It's cool. Ames, take the Eldo. Where are you going? I don't run. Okay, this doesn't make any sense. Let's go over it one more time. Look, I have told you everything I can remember. He warned you, right? You said that he hired a bodyguard, he thought he was being paranoid. He's concerned about your safety, but the one piece of evidence which could have protected you, he hides. It just doesn't add up. Do you want another drink, a snack? We've got cashews, a variety of canned fish. No, I don't want a snack. I was in Geneva. He called, he told me everything was fine, but he didn't want me to come to Africa. Two days later, he's dead. That's it. That's the last communication I had with him, apart from the letter, but he made no mention of the CIA! Whoa, whoa, whoa, what letter? A personal letter he left in his briefcase in Geneva. It was nothing. Just last words from a husband to a wife. Ilsa, I need to read that letter. Could be something you missed. Now where is it? Well, there's two things that are clear in this letter. He knew he was gonna die, and he loved you very much. I know. But there's just one problem. It's not written by your husband. It's signed by a Mr. Ross. Oh, here we go. Oh, it's silly. Every month we would meet in the hotel bar at the Lamont and pretend to be strangers and spend the night together under a false name, and he was Mr. Ross. The photo of Julia and Marshall was taken in that bar, which is why I thought he was having an affair. I think I will have that other drink. Did you always stay in the same room? Good evening. My name's Mrs. Ross. My husband and I rented out a suite for the year, but unfortunately I seem to have misplaced the key. Of course, Mrs. Ross. I remember you. You'll have your key in just a moment. Thank you. Chance, I'm tapped into the hotel security feed. Something tells me I'm not the only one. Okay, everyone on hold. Let's see where they go, what they're looking for. Either way, they don't leave the hotel alive. This lobby's a little bit too crowded for my taste. She's got the key. Holding. Everyone stay in position. Okay, we got 'em. Tenth floor. Move in now. Once we recover the photos, capture and kill. Now! Get your hands in the air! Freeze! Hands up, Mrs. Pucci! Now turn around slowly. Right now! Please, please, don't shoot. It's not her. Repeat, the target is not here. God! Good, good, good, good. Ilsa, they took the bait. You're up. Hurry up, find the photographs and get out of there. All right, I need eyes everywhere. Find them! What do you want me to do? Kill her. We need backup on the tenth floor now. Chance, they got reinforcements heading towards you. How are we gonna get out of here? What? I don't do the thinking. That's your job. Ilsa... Speed it up and get outta there. Very clever, Mr. Ross. Winston, I've got it. Good, good. Now get the hell outta there. Julia's on her way up. She's headed right for you. Ilsa, what are you doing? What are you doing? Chance. We got a huge problem. Hold on. Ilsa's not leaving. And she's got a gun. Ilsa, go downstairs. Ilsa, listen to me. Ilsa! Chance, Ilsa has just taken Julia hostage. Looks like she's headed up to the roof. Listen, when they come in through that door, you go in through a window. Do not stop running until you get to Winston and you get the hell outta here. Where are you going? I'm going up there to get Ilsa. I need the security feed on every floor, every stair-- what the hell just happened? We just lost the connection. Get this thing back up and running. They're here. Find them. McNally, talk to me. What do you see? I'm in the loading dock. Someone got into the power box. Let me see if I can rewire-- Hobbs, get over there now. He's on the loading dock. Hobbs? Hobbs? Mrs. Pucci, you're making a big mistake. I don't know what you're hoping to accomplish with this. I want answers. I found this. Is this what you're looking for? Well, it's over. So talk, whatever your name is. I want to know why. I want-- I want to know everything. I want to know-- I want to know Marshall's last words. I want to know every detail. Does it matter? He got in the way, he needed to be eliminated. As simple as that. Fine. Then I'm going to eliminate you. Simple as that. Ilsa! Could you have picked a lower floor? You're not supposed to be here. You could say that for the both of us. Don't try and talk me out of this. I'm here to tell you to hurry up. There's a dozen agents on their way up here to kill us. So just go ahead and pull the trigger. Whoa. Hey. She killed Marshall. She deserves to die. Listen, nobody deserves to die. This just isn't you. Go, go! Stay where you are! Don't move! Drop the weapon! I said, drop the weapon! I don't think they share my views regarding death. Right there! What now? Well, they're probably gonna shoot us. Listen, we'll always have Geneva. What? Geneva? Mr. Chance. No, Chance! I was on that mission. I actually know what you guys are talking about. That's where they jumped off that 17-story-- Oh, no. I mean, that only works if there's a body of water below, right? Geneva was a once-in-a-lifetime silly, silly thing. But it sure was fun. Mrs. Pucci, I'm going to need that microchip, please. Trust me. Ready? Yeah. Who are you? I'm the freak. Call it off. Everyone stand down. It's over. Drop your weapons. Yeah, drop 'em. Okay. Did they really jump? Winston? Please don't let me go. Never. All right, Bill. Look, it was nothing personal. It was just business. I just couldn't have you out there knowing what you know. You understand? I understand. That's my issue, Bill. You found my pressure point. He's my world. You understand? That's my kid. Nothing personal, dude. Just business. ♪ Seen through your eyes ♪ ♪ seen through your eyes ♪ ♪ there by the Grace of God go I ♪ ♪ I don't know what they mean ♪ ♪ I don't know what they mean ♪ ♪ and I say ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ooh ♪ ♪ ♪ I'm gonna make sure that this thing gets into the right hands.

Keep it. You never know when you may need to play a billionaire again. Seriously? It's mine? Can I hock it? Really? It's yours. Do what you like with it. Well, good-bye, Mrs. Pucci.

You coulda said good-bye to her. Oh, Ilsa, she left already? I thought that wasn't until tomorrow. Right. Okay, what's the point? She's leaving anyway. Ow? I known you a long time. First time I ever seen you scared. She's-- yeah? She's an impressive woman. It lives. Continue. Well, that's it. Come on, what's the point? Somebody just ends up getting hurt anyway.
