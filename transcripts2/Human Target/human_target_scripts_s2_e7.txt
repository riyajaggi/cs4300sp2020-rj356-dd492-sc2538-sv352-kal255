 He's over there all by himself. Go over there. He's alone. You're hot. How about if I can tell you what you do for a living, you buy me a drink? Sounds like a fair deal. I should warn you, what I do is pretty obscure. Okay. That was clue number one. Do you wear a suit? Only when absolutely necessary.

 Is it dangerous? Occasionally. Okay, I got it. You're a day trader. High risk securities. Am I that obvious? What are you drinking? Bourbon. Never younger than 15 years. Never lighter than me. Just like you. You can leave us now. Uh, a rain check. I'm really sorry. Whatever.

 Maria Gallego. What brings you to San Francisco? Old flame. Hmm. Anyone I know? I don't think so. Strong, macho type. Has a thing for diving in front of bullets. Know anyone like that? He sounds like a nut job. I'll keep my eye out though. So it's a long way from South America. I heard you had a new boss. Couldn't imagine you working for someone. Had to see for myself. She's not really a boss. It's more like a business partner. Didn't know you were for sale. If I had known, I would have made an offer. So you're free to do as you please? Ah, here it comes. What'd you have in mind? I think I'd rather tell you in private. I think we should get another round. I don't want you to think I'm that easy. Mr. Chance got the email about this meeting. We discussed it twice today. Mr. Guerrero's absence I can understand. In fact I expected it. But Mr. Chance is showing a blatant disregard for my leadership. Maybe that's the problem. He don't exactly see you as a boss. He sees you as more like a partner. So he's protesting? That's a bit childish, isn't it? Hey, you know, what about me? I'm here. I had stuff to do tonight. You're right. You've both generously given up your time to be here. We'll begin without him. Oh, better late than never. All right, what the hell is this meeting about? Mr. Guerrero, I'm rather stunned that you're here. I'm not reading anything, I'm not signing anything. If this meeting takes more than five minutes, you and I got an issue. I got someone waiting in the car. In the trunk. Right, okay, well, very quickly then. You're all doing a wonderful job. I just need you to be a bit more conscientious of your methods. Meaning what? Seven lawsuits. Not to worry, I have a team of lawyers handling it. In fact I think they rather prefer it to the pencil-pushing work they usually do. The problem is it puts my foundation in jeopardy. Well, see, this is what we do around here, Ilsa. Things get messy. Understood, which is why, at the risk of inciting Mr. Guerrero here, I need you to sign these documents. It creates a subsidiary unrelated to the Pucci Foundation, putting Mr. Chance as the head. I of course will retain ownership. It was the sort of gesture I was rather hoping would bridge the chasm between us, but-- what a sweet thing to do. Feel free to sign my name anywhere. I use a big, black "x." I'm gonna get this guy some air. Perhaps I should have put your name as the figurehead, Mr. Winston. Ilsa, I really respect what you're trying to do here, I really do, but there are two things i've always loved about this job. One, we get to shoot bad guys, and, two, there's no bureaucracy. You, uh, have a good evening. You know, if you just want to put my name as the head, that's cool. Ooh, would that mean that I was in charge? I'm going to be honest with you about one thing. That's one more thing than I'd expect outta you. I've missed you. Well, apparently not that much. A lot has happened this past year. My country is in turmoil. I don't even know where to begin. We could start with talking about the black SUV that's been idling outside for past five minutes. Fake license plates, only five digits. Or if you prefer, we could talk about the gentlemen on the bar stool over there. It's a little brisk outside. But most people take their jackets off, unless they're keeping their heat on the inside. Damn it. I love that you're always one step ahead of me. When you show up, trouble does tend to follow. If you want to leave now, Chance, I understand. There's an exit in the back. And miss the fun of a visit from you? You packing? Mm-hmm. On three? One. Two. Wait a minute. Did you come here to see me or because you're in trouble? Because I'm in trouble. I always want to see you. Slut. ♪ ♪ Thank you. Shouldn't I be thanking you? Nah, my life was getting a little boring there for a while. Glad you're back. ♪ Human Target 2x07 ♪ A Problem Like Maria Original Air Date on January 5, 2011 == sync, corrected by elderman == == for www.addic7ed.com == ♪ ♪ She's in pretty serious trouble. That girl is serious trouble. She always has been. Okay, Maria may color outside the lines, but it's always for a good cause. Yeah, like that boatload of gold you left her with in the jungle. Chick's bad news, dude. You should cut her loose. See this? Don't do this. Don't put me in a position to be agreeing with him. I'm sorry, guys, but she's in trouble. She was almost killed last night by agents of Victor Escalante. Ah, Mr. Chance. How good of you to show up for work today. Good morning. Sorry I missed the meeting yesterday, but got a friend in town. Friend? She's actually part of the movement against Victor Escalante in Baldova. Oh, that scoundrel. I've tried to have him deposed for years. She just got some news about one of her colleagues a couple weeks ago, Diego Garcia. Oh, I know him. He spent several years working for our organization in Sudan. He's a wonderful man. Yeah, he's being held at one of Escalante's country estates right now. Soon he'll be transported to the capital for execution. Tomorrow, Escalante's having a party at the same estate. It might be our last chance to-- so your friend needs our help to get Diego out of there? Hang on a second. Did you say tomorrow? Well, if you gentlemen have plans, you might want to bring that up. No, of course not. That's what we do. My contacts at the consulate may be able to secure invitations for Escalante's party. That would be fantastic. Yeah. One thing though. You sure this is a good idea? What's your concern, Mr. Winston? On that note, I'm outta here. I've got business down at sanitation. No, wait, wait, wait. What's going on here? Please speak freely. What Mr. Winston is trying to say is that my friend, Maria, can be complicated at times, but I can handle her. Define complicated. Maybe not the best choice of words. She's passionate, driven. She's a handful. Hola! Hola. Ugh. Winston. It's been too long. I was just saying that to Chance. And you must be Ilsa Pucci. I've heard so much about you. Chance was just telling me last night what a wonderful boss-- oh, well, actually it's partner. Forgive me. What a wonderful partner you have been. It has been quite a learning curve. Ilsa has been generous enough to offer us entrance to Escalante's party tomorrow. Thank you. Oh, I am forever in your debt. Oh, please, it's just a phone call. It's not me that puts my life on the line. Mr. Chance, are you sure you can rescue Dr. Garcia with all the complications? No problem. We'll get him. That's all I needed to hear. I'll have them ready my jet. Jet? Yeah, we travel well these days. Party's gonna take place on the main level of the estate. Diego is being held in a room in the basement of the property. Well, once we disable the security cameras, we can get into the basement. And we grab Diego. Yes, but not we. This is my job. You can't expect me to sit in the car while you have all the fun. Don't worry, you're going in there. Just not with me. See in order to gain entry to the security feed, we need an access card. The only one in play is with the guard supervisor, and he's gonna be inside the party. You go anywhere near that party, you're gonna get spotted, and we're all screwed. I go in with the guests, gain access to the card, disable the security feed. You slip in and get Diego. So if I'm not Mrs. Soros, then who is? What? Why are you all staring at me? Thank you, thank you. Stop fidgeting. Seriously, I've never shown less skin in any outfit ever. Feel like I'm going to a barn-raising. All right, I need you to stay focused. Don't drink, and for God sakes stand up straight. Oh, some fun date you are. Watch and learn. You guys in position? In position. Let's pull up the security feed and start-- I know what I'm doing. Here's the plan. See the guy in the sash? That's Victor Escalante. Steer clear of him. Now we need find out who has the access card. I got it. Hold on. We got a problem. That's Hector and Eladio Lopez. Okay, that's not good news. Last I heard, they were in Sao Paulo working for the Polanco family. Well, they're either making a jump up or down. Depends on how you look at it. I'm sorry. Does anyone want to tell me who these guys are? They're private security with a vengeance. Yeah, like a deranged vengeance. These guys did a job in Caracas once. Boss shorted them a hundred bucks, probably by mistake. Boss disappears. Every year on his birthday his girlfriend receives a body part, special delivery. Well, if anyone has the access key to the security room, it's Hector Lopez. Gracias. All right, count to five, then meet me in the other room. One Mississippi, two Mississippi. Three Mississippi-- Buenas noches. Hola. Mi nombre es Julio Escalante. I'm Victor's brother. Oh. Incluso en un cuarto de cosas hermosas usted se destaca por completo. Gracias. What'd he just say? He said in a room full of beautiful things she stands out. How come your name is Guerrero and you don't speak Spanish? None of your business. I don't talk about my private life ever. I didn't realize your name was so private. Why do you and Winston dislike me so much? Can't speak for Winston. Look, I believe when emotions get involved in the work we do, things go bad. I agree. Chance and I are just old friends. Yeah? You're kidding, right? You seen the look on his face since you showed up? Guy can't stop grinning. It's off-putting. We care about one another. That's--that's all. Do me a favor, make sure he never sees that look on your face. At least when his life's on the line. Lose him now. You meet me outside, ten minutes. I'm gonna give you the ride of your life. Hola, hermano. Comandante Escalante. A nuestro amigo, Alberto Sanchez. Viva Sanchez. Viva la revolution. Ames, now or never. Anybody got a lime? Who's got a lime? Aqui! Gracias. Alto. Viva Sanchez. Viva Sanchez. Viva Sanchez. Winston, we got the access key. Where do we go now? Hector Lopez has me on tractor beam. There's a stairway off the main room on the right. It's clear. Bottom of the steps to security. Got it. Better make it quick, dude. Hector Lopez is on your tail. All right, Winston, we're in the security room. Load the video feed. Okay, security feed looped. Four minutes start now. Maria, you're up. Wish me luck. Don't blow it. We're only here 'cause of you. Perimeter access doors unlocked. Nice. Thanks. All right, Chance, your girlfriend is in the service entrance with Diego. Okay, she's not my girlfriend. Please, even I can tell you like that chick. She's got Garcia. She's headed your way. She's gonna need some help. Your turn. Okay, we have to go now. Dude's pretty nicely dressed for a prisoner. Wait a minute, that's not Diego Garcia. That's Julio Escalante. He hit on me. Tenemos un problema. We just kidnapped the dictator's brother. Maria, what's going on? Diego Garcia is already in the capital. The only way to get him back is to trade him for Escalante's brother. Kidnapping? You're telling us this now? Why'd you lie to us? It's complicated. Yeah, well, tell us on the way. We gotta go, come on. Get in the car. What the hell's going on here? I told you, I need to make a trade for Diego's life. I don't like liars. You want to see who's a better shot? Guerrero, put the weapon down. And if anyone's gonna kill her, it'll be me. So why'd you do it? Why'd you lie to me? I'm sorry, I had one opportunity, one small window to get Julio. I couldn't be sure that your new partner would approve of kidnapping. Yeah, she's got a point there. You didn't lie to Ilsa. You lied to me. I had to. No, you didn't. I would've done anything for you. Now you're on your own. You don't understand. Good luck negotiating with the Lopez brothers. Chance, Diego Garcia is my husband. Uh-oh. That's cold. Chance I'm sorry. Diego is your hour husband? I wasn't sure you'd help me if you knew the truth. Thanks for thinking so little of me. They're going to kill him tomorrow. Please, this was my only play. I'm sorry. Get in the plane. Come on. Listen, I know you warned me. We all have our blind spots, bro. There's this girl in Osaka. Enough said. Are you serious, man? We're gonna play this out? We're gonna trade Julio for Diego? Only if you're cool with it. Whatever you need, bro. But I ain't doing it for her. Understand. All right, I'll stay here and reach out to the Lopez brothers, propose the trade. You sure? Yeah, I got a history with them. And I'm comfortable in the world of violently insane. Call you when it's arranged. Ames, get off the plane. What? Why me? Just in case it gets really scary. I might need help. So you can translate, genius. You know what, you can mock me all you want. I ain't the one that can't speak Spanish. Women. I'm trying to remain calm here. Professional. So please, before I jump to any unnecessary conclusions, can someone explain to me why there is an innocent man handcuffed to a chair in my conference room? No thank you. These ain't for you. We need to trade him for for Diego Garcia's life. It's the dictator's brother. What? And this was the plan all along, kidnapping? And you kept it from me? Winston! Not the original plan. So what happened down there? These are for you. Remember that handful I told you about a while back? Maria. She lied to us. Well, she lied to me. Why? She lied because she's married to Diego Garcia. Oh. I'm sorry. It's not an issue. We'll deal with it. 'Cause I got a plan. Well, I've heard that before, and it didn't end well. I'm gonna have to take matters into my own hands. Starting with giving that poor man some food and water. Good thinking. I'm so, so sorry about this. No problema, senorita. Can I get you anything? You got any scotch? Well, he's got a certain charm to him. Doesn't he? Hope you're enjoying this. Don't flatter yourself. Pay attention. When we go in, don't say anything more than you need to. Lopez brothers use violence as a means of first resort. They enjoy torture and dismemberment. Sounds like someone else I know. Listen, no personal information, all right? Unless you want to move, get facial reconstructive surgery, shred your fingerprints. That's assuming you make it out of there. I can handle it, Guerrero. No, you can't.

I'm gonna call the State Department. They know all the players and can negotiate a settlement before anyone's killed. Ilsa, wait. Ah, miss Gallego. Excuse me if I don't stick around and chat. I have to go and clean up your mess. Ilsa, don't call the State Department. They can't handle this. Oh, and you can? I got a plan. That him? Yeah, Guerrero, you got a deal? A couple of small hitches. Like what? Well, first off, turns out Victor Escalante doesn't actually want his brother back. He wants Maria instead. Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. What's the second hitch? They have two more hostages. Looks like I'm gonna have to revise my earlier plan. Ilsa, stop. We tried it your way and ended up with half our team captured and an innocent man kidnapped. Well, if we do it your way now, everyone ends up dead. Mr. Chance, do you work for me? Yes. No. Because we're partners, right? Right. Well, you've had your turn. You backed Maria, and it was a colossal failure. Now it's my turn. I have a better idea. Escalante's been looking for me for ten years. Do what he wants, trade me for Diego and your friends. Escalante sees you, he's gonna kill you. Fine, I'm willing to trade my life for theirs. As much as I disapprove or your methods, miss Gallego, I won't have your blood on my hands. Well, if I don't go, you'll have their blood on your hands. Let's try a way where nobody gets any blood on their hands. We arrange an exchange. When they think they're in the clear, we set up an ambush, we get everybody back. Sounds like a foolproof plan. It's the only way to get everyone back alive. I hate to be blunt, Mr. Chance, but I'm the one who keeps the lights on here. If you want to keep it like that, then you'll let me handle this. Partner. You getting all this? Yes, sir. This is all my fault. They're going to kill them all. You're right, it is all your fault. You shouldn't have lied to me. You put my friends in jeopardy. And after we get them back, I don't ever want to see you again. After? Okay, contact Escalante and let him know we're coming. Don't thank me. I know I've been just kind of sitting back watching this thing unfold, but I got something to say now and you ain't gonna like it. I think Ilsa has a point. I think the State Department can help us. We can't take a chance that they screw it up. So I say we take the Kevlar vests and the P90. Hold on a second. Think we should bring the M4s? No, what I think we should do is take a minute to consider the ramifications of all this. We all get killed. I've considered it. It's not very enjoyable. I'm not talking about the rescue now. I'm talking about this. All this. We go up against Ilsa, win or lose, you know this is over, right? Ilsa just doesn't understand. We survived on our own before. I mean, sure, we were poor, but we were happy. I don't make a move without you. Say the word, we let Ilsa handle it. Promise me one thing. If this is it, if this is really the end... I get to use the rocket launcher. This dress is unbearable. Do you have any idea how uncomfortable this thing is? Yeah, 'cause you haven't shut up about it. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just feeling a little claustrophobic. You know, what, with the dress and the cell and the shoes-- claustrophobic? I think maybe you should be a little bit more concerned about the malaria or the plague-infested rodents. Maybe the fact that they're preparing to kill us even if Chance turns over Maria. Do you have any good news? Yeah, we won't be alive long enough to eat the slop they call food. Diego? Si. He said "yes." Estas bien? Estas herido? Escucha. Vamos a ser asesinados. All right, enough. Start talking English before I rip somebody's tongue out. I hope Maria is not foolish enough to come here. Of course she is, dude. You married her. I heard the guards talk. They're going to kill us all once they have Maria. What? I told you. Yeah, and I just thought it was your usual doom-and-gloom prediction. Will you buck up? Chance will think of something. Well, I hope he's very clever. More importantly, he's very crazy. I understand it may seem slightly unusual, keeping a man restrained in the office, but it was an extreme situation. The hostage has been treated with the utmost dignity. And if he wants to press charges of any kind, we totally understand. Hello? Where is everyone? Julio. They said it was okay to make lunch. Yes, yes, of course. Where did the others go? Hey, so she was really serious about sacrificing herself, huh? She's got her faults, but she will not hesitate to take a bullet for something she believes in. Yeah, I don't know anyone like that. You hungry or something? Uh-uh. Thirsty? Oh. Yeah, I guess. There's something I need you to hear. Now seems like the best time since I have you trapped at 36,000 feet. I'm listening. You're not the right man for me. Well, I'm glad we've had this talk. You always run away. And you're not the type to settle down. And to be honest with you, you're a little too crazy for me. That doesn't mean I'm not in love with you. Always have been. What about, uh, what's his name? Diego's a good man, doing important work, and I care for him deeply. But? But he's not you. I need you to know this just in case things don't go according to plan. Don't worry, things never go according to plan. Whoa. What's going on? We're turning around. Hey, what's going on? Hello, partner. Did you really think you could take my plane without me knowing? Of course not, but you left in the middle of a conversation. Well, let's finish it in person. We're practically there. We're not coming back. Oh, yes, you are. I've instructed my pilot to return to San Francisco. I'll see you in a few hours. Oh, and don't bother trying to get in the cockpit. The door's bolted. Chance, what is happening? What are you doing? Uh-uh. Hey! Female voice: Warning. Loss of cabin pressure. What did you do? We don't have enough oxygen to get back to San Francisco. Female voice: Oxygen levels critical. Are you crazy or something? I've been hearing that. Warning. Loss of cabin pressure. You know, just between us, you oughta admit one thing. Things have gotten a little out of hand. Yeah. I can see the airfield. Don't worry, like I said, Chance has a plan. We're going too low. Things are gonna get bumpy. Maybe he doesn't. What's he doing? Vamos. Vamos. You know what you're doing? You kidding? I've been waiting all year for a cousin Carter. Chance. Hey, don't worry. We'll get him back. Sorry about the landing. We had a pressurization problem on the descent. Where is Maria Gallego? Oh, yeah, uh... I'm hoping that you're going to honor our agreement. My cousin Carter would. How many relatives you guys got? A lot. Cover him. From what? Oh, yeah. All right. Hebrew? Instructions are in heb-- she buys secondhand artillery? You got Maria. Now release the others. Okay, I was hoping things would be moving along by now. It's starting to look a bit much like a firing squad for my taste, bro. Also hoping we'd see cousin Carter by now! What the hell am I gonna do with this? How hard can it be? All right, good. Oh, good, touch screen. That's good. Down! What can I say, better late than dead. Oy, pretty boy! Chance! Oh, here we go. Maria! Aah! Chance! Maria, hold on! Maria! Hang on! Ahh! Well, at least you got to fire the rocket launcher. Put it on the ground. Can I say it now? Sure. Thank you. Don't mention it. Is this him, the man I owe my life to? Well, I was just in the neighborhood. Then I guess I'm a very lucky man. You're right. You are a very lucky man. I hope you will return soon, when this is a free country for everyone. I'll give you two a moment. Okay. Uh, Chance-- let's not drag this out. We both know what it is. Okay. Well, I'll see you. Just give me a sign. A wink, a nod, anything, and I'll come back with you. I meant what I said on the plane. Maria, have a nice life. I'm going to miss you, Chance. Could've told you that. Good riddance. He should run off with her. What? They got good chemistry. It's hard to find. Should've shot her when I had the chance. Well, there goes trouble. Yeah, and here it comes again. Oh, please tell me this isn't who I think it is. Mrs. Pucci. Nice to see you again. A word with you, Mr. Chance. Shall we stay? Yes. No. Forget for a moment whether or not I'm your boss. Partners don't treat each other like this. You stole my plane and you completely disrespected me. That was not my intention. Well, what was your intention? To save their lives at all costs. If that meant hijacking a plane, it isn't the first time. But it is your last. That's it, we're leaving. Okay, look, I know I ruffled your feathers a little bit, but in this world the ends justify the means. It's the business we're in. I know the business I'm in. What I've discovered is I don't know the person I'm in it with. Slow down there, hoss. What? I want to hear. What are you, goofy? The last place in the world you want to be for the next nine hours is on that plane. Are you coming? You know what, we'll just fly commercial. Don't worry. On our own dime. Yeah, later, dude. They have champagne on that plane. And we've been in a prison cell for the last 12 hours. All right, dude, that's it. I'm not flying anywhere with her. I'll find my own way home. I'm gonna go with them. You and I need to have a conversation. Resolve some of our issues. A little help, please. You made your bed, pal. It's gonna be a long flight. I need to fly to Tokyo first. After you. Look, I don't want to fight with you, Mr. Chance. Finally, we agree. I just don't think our professional relationship is working. I don't think that we've been in this much agreement since we started working together. In that case, I suppose there's nothing left to say, except we're done. Fine with me. We're as done as dinosaurs. For what little time is left of our relationship, assume I'm able to keep up with your infantile vocabulary without the need for metaphor. Okay, listen, if you don't appreciate my word choice, then we might as well say nothing. You won't hear a peep out of me. Me neither. You always have to have the last word, don't you? No. == sync, corrected by elderman == == for www.addic7ed.com ==
