 Sam? Sam! Come back to us. How's he doing? He's doing fine. - Who are you? - I'm your worst nightmare. What are you doing? What are you... I'm going to kill you, Tyler. No! Stop! No! You on strike? Hands off your ding-a-ling, we've had another shout.

 Well, seeing as how you broke my door down, I take it it's big. As Shelley Winters' arse. Tyler! My name is Sam Tyler. I had an accident and I woke up in 1973. Am I mad, in a coma, or back in time? Whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet. Now, maybe if I can work out the reason, I can get home. This is the third violent attack in two days. The bloody press'll be all over us. Move it, you bastards! Inspector! Inspector! Ray, if any of these swine put a toe on the bus, break it. - Snap out of it, Gladys. Job to do. - Come on. Give us a break! DCI Hunt, any comment...

 Got a journalist chained in your basement for random beatings, Guv? Don't have a basement. That lot should stay off me back. Yeah, well, they're asking for results and we're not obliging. Looks like the attack was vicious. Couple of blows at least. First one struck the window, the second hit him square in the jaw. Obviously, a blunt object was used. Crowbar, hammer. That's weird. Take his money, but leave his gold rings. DCI Hunt! DCI Hunt! I know you can hear us up there! Guv. Look at them. Bloody parasites. Blood on the streets for a second night, Mr Hunt. A shortage of results on serious crime. What's going on? I am trying to do my job, and you limp-wristed Sallys are in me way. - Chris, Ray? - Let us do our jobs. Shoo. Good doggies. This is just the beginning, Tyler. Hurts, don't it? I'm enjoying this. - You're all skin and bones... - Skin and bones! Rag and bone! Rag and bone. Let go of me arm, you're hurting it! Your sarge is about to give me a good kicking! He's a DC these days. We find it suits him better. Right, listen up. These violent attacks are totally unacceptable, and this department is dedicated to bringing the culprits to justice, swiftly and fairly. What exactly are you doing to curb this crime spree, Mr Hunt? Well, we're, erm... We're, erm... - We're doing all we can. - Yeah, we're doing all we can. Found it, Guv. The arches. Ray, what do we say when we see a piece of evidence on the ground? Wait for Forensics. What sort of man steps up behind a bloke on a bus and puts that down on his head? I want you to nail this fast. So we preserve the scene, we dust for prints... You've seen it out there, Sam. People are scared. Pull in someone from the "we don't like you" list, put their dabs on the hammer, charge 'em, whip it past the beak. Loads of scum out there deserve another spell inside. It'll buy us more time. You want to wear the sheriff's badge, Guv? Well, it comes with responsibility. By the book. Cobblers. The world's getting tougher, the police have to match it. The people want it done, they don't want to know how. Too right. You don't want a mirror at the dentist, do you? -Inspector! -Inspector, a word! - Harry. - Hello, Gene. Bastard of a week, eh? Not for me, thank you, sir. He only likes the ones from a sweet shop. - Not missing tea with the mayor? - Less of that, Chief Inspector. But I'm probably missing tea with some bugger. - So, you're the boy wonder. - Inspector Tyler, sir. Chief Superintendent Harry Woolf. You're a lucky man. You've got the best here. I weep with happiness every morning, sir. He's not so different from you when you were my DI, Gene. Minus the looks, of course. So, we got problems? I'm saying it to all divisions. The city needs to feel safe, Gene. Point is, this is under the glare, so make it clean, make it count. Yes? So that would be by the book, then, sir? Yes, that's it. By the jolly old book. Let's get this party started. I want a match on those dabs inside of two days! Oh, my Lord. Take a look at this. OK, fingertip search. Off you go, lads. Like I showed you. In a line, slowly. In a line! Now hands that do dishes can feel soft as your face... - Piss off! - With mild green Fairy Liquid Ray, bring in Andy Eddows. He's a mugger, Guv, but he's never used a weapon. He might have got wind of who's behind this. Oh, you're going to bang heads. Let joy be unconfined. I am searching for evidence. Running prints past Scotty Yard. Interviewing informants. Thorough... and by the book. - Who cordoned off the scene? - I told them it was on your say-so. Come on, we've got a bus to catch. Right, go slow, Annie. Take your time. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. What was all that about? You're as white as a sheet, you are. I didn't sleep very well last night. Nightmares. I was dreaming about... You know, where I come from. You mean "Wooo, Hyde". - There was someone... - What's that? Don't touch it. I saw this on "Man in a Suitcase". Except Richard Bradford wasn't using a pair of eyebrow tweezers. I'm going to talk slowly so you understand. This is not the Magna Carta. Just put an X. - Come on, Askey! - What's going on, Phyllis? Trying to sign him into the funny farm. - Just sign. Come on! - Chris, where's the Guv? You don't understand, I've been seeing things. Get off me! No one believes me, but it's true. I see things. I have visions. Hey. Hey, hey, just calm down. It's horrible. 'Cause I know the truth, and no one else does. Just chill out, OK? The world isn't what they think. How do you think that makes me feel? So alone. I'm so alone! - Come on, lad. - Get off me. Let me speak to him! Come on. Get him out of here. - Come on! - Help me! Let me go! Don't half make it easy when they're space rangers. No briefs, no statements, no dull stuff. Call the quack. End of story. - He sees things. - Yeah, poor messed-up sod. Oh, we got an ID on the bloke on the bus. George Rills. 51, no record. I need to see Hunt. Oh, he's having a little chat with that mugger he's pulled in. Black suits you, Eddows. Do you want an eye in the same colour? I was at me father's funeral. - It could be yours next, pal. - Guv. Who's mugging folk with a claw hammer? Don't know. No! Dad! Tell the truth, or I'll kick the crap out of your old fella. Do you want to tell the press how we started this enquiry by committing GBH on a pot of human remains? We need solid leads. - How about the casino? - Not now, I'm working. Boss. List of belongings found on the victim. Listen up, you lot. Rills and the others were probably mugged after a big night in the casino. If this was a straight mugging, why didn't they take his jewellery? Rills's son said he was wearing a gold fob watch. They took that. Maybe they couldn't get the rings off his fingers. Or the bells off his toes. Morgue report, Guv. George Rills died of a heart attack induced by stress. Funny what a hammer to the skull can do, isn't it? Guv. Plod found Rills's bus ticket. The fare stage is Cedar Road. 300 yards from the Wild Card Casino. Right, we'll swing down there. I know the owner. Good work, Raymondo. I'm bumping you back up to DS. This time, make it stand for Detective Sergeant, not Dog Shit. Guv. The press are already calling us incompetent. This is not the time to start dishing out promotions. I need a new sarge. Great. OK. Whistle "She'll Be Coming Round The Mountain", he'll make you an inspector. All right, Daphne. Want to improve the team? Find me a new DC. - I didn't ask for plod. - I did. I need statements taking from all the staff. This'll save time. - Good evening, ladies. - Oh, piss off! I've got a tingling in my tummy button. Job at hand, Chris. Job at hand. Private club. Special pass. Mr Hunt. How are you, Gene? You're not here for the roulette. Tyler. - Tyler, this is Mr... - Crane. Tony Crane. Sorry, I've had too much Cinzano. Do we know each other? We will, one day. I mean... no. We're here on business. I presume you've read about these attacks. Well, a bloke was killed last night. The last thing he did was visit your club. Have you got a book of members? No problem. No one was acting suspiciously in here last night? We fully comply with the city law. 48-hour wait on membership. George Rills is not in the registration book. Then he weren't here. He caught a bus right outside your club. And we found this... near his body. Never use Crown chips. We use Star. How long have you had your gaming licence? I had two pinball arcades in Bolton. Got this place seven month ago. How'd you raise the cash? Backstreet gaming dens? Inspector. Government have closed a lot of places down. Industry's gasping for air. We don't need our clients being mugged as well. - Beers all round? - Double Diamond works wonders. - Not for me. - Poof. I can get you every member's address, bank details. - You might find a lead. - Very good of you. Fellas. I'm not a clergyman, but I am legit. The more people like me grow up, the better it'll be for the industry. Oh, you will grow, Tony. I'm glad you think so, Inspector. I want to have a look around. Mi casa, su casa. Routine interviews, and you're giving Crane the third degree. Somebody like Tony Crane does not rise so fast without getting blood on his hands. - And as for where he's heading... - Sounds like a vendetta. Tell me, was he boffing your mother up the Harris and eating all your cream horns too? I know Crane. Well, I know somebody just like him. Ended up running a gaming empire. No one could stop him. Well, almost no one. Guv, don't you ever look at somebody you're sending down and... and wish you'd done it years ago? Crane's legit, Sam. We'll visit the other casinos in the morning. Start afresh. Now I'll have a go on the blackjack table. Never waste a night out. Oh, my God. You staying till the uniform boys are done, or can I tempt you to a hand of blackjack? It's you, innit? You're doing this to me. Look, Inspector. I don't know what your game is... You're sat next to me, aren't you? You're sat next to my bed in the hospital room. - Are you feeling OK? - Don't you touch me. Who do you think I am, Inspector? Sir, do you want us to start with the working croupiers now, or... Sir? Sam! Sam... Oi, what are you doing? -Oi! -You can't do that. Leaving so soon, Inspector? Can't we tempt you to stay? I had him on remand. I had witnesses ready to testify. CPS said it was watertight. Calm down. Talk sense. How could he be out, Annie? My case was sound. I go to hospital and suddenly the whole thing falls apart? They must have thrown the case out for some reason. And now Tony Crane has found me and he's getting his revenge. He's torturing me. Well, just remember, you can't get at him from a padded cell. Leaving so soon, Inspector? Can't we tempt you to stay? Can't we tempt you to stay? You used my wife to testify against me. But you couldn't protect her. Eve's blood is on your hands, Tyler. And what did it get you? I'm out, and you're locked in there. Eve. - And what do you want, Inspector? - Eve Crane. Eve Olawi, actually. - Not forever. - Excuse me? I should have known it was you as soon as I saw you. Look... I owe it to myself to say this to you, OK? Leave Tony Crane. Just go far away from him. He's going to ask you to marry him and will make you a business partner. Is that what this is all about? Does it bother you that much? A coloured bird with a bit of power? Look, I know this is going to sound mad, but... Tony Crane will destroy you, Eve, and he'll take his time doing it. That is why you will betray him in 30 years' time. Just save yourself the pain of a miserable life and leave him now. Not that it's your business, but he loves me. You have no idea where all this is heading. Nobody ever does. - Eve. - Annie. No, she runs the business with him. She went to the police about him. So he beat her to death. Right, so we're talking about a man committing a murder in the future. I was meant to be protecting her. I was trying to get her to safety. Before I could, Crane killed her. But now I can save her. I've been given the chance every copper dreams about: stopping a killer before he kills. You can't convict a person for something they haven't done yet. Tony Crane is behind those attacks. He is behind the murder of George Rills. We can get him life for that. We can stop him from becoming... I'm going back to the scene. There's work to be done. Work you started. Boss? Bloody hell, you look like something out of "The Addams Family". - Up all night. - Oh, aye? What was her name? - Migraine. - German bird? Where's the Guv? Here you go. These are the candidates from Uniform for the DC job. PC Chapman's in his 80s, in't he? Give over, he's 45. You must give me the name of his personal trainer. Oh. Man in medical need of a Scotch. There's a man who will destroy people's lives, Nelson. I've got to stop him from becoming a killer. Tall order. He's a monster. Will be one day. Can you really know what a man will become? You don't understand. I see things. I had a vision... A vision. No one understands. You so sure, mon brave? Sam, sometimes you have to look again at who you have around you. You might find the strength you need. No fancy hunches. By the book. You started this and now I'm sticking with it. Both Rills and the other victims may have won heavily at Crane's casino. - Chips don't match. - We only have his word for it. We pull him in, we put the squeeze on him. Why is that so hard for you to agree to? Because I am policing in the full glare of the public bloody eye, the Chief Super is taking an interest, and we have no flipping evidence! And I can't believe I just said that! I know what this man is capable of. You after my sheriff's badge? You always have to fight me. Even when I'm doing it your way. Tony Crane is rotten to the core. It is in his blood. Tell Askey to shove over. There's room in that padded cell for two. Shut up, DC Carling. - DS. - Whatever. Leave Tony Crane be. Double-check all statements, go through all the door-to-doors again. Chase up the dabs. We'll build this case again from ground level. Party time. Wagon Wheel, strawberry milk. Works every time. Not this time. Headaches, upset stomach... You're not looking after yourself. You see, Crane here was almost convicted of blackmail in 1971, but the claimant suddenly dropped all the charges, because he got to him. That's what happened with my murder case. I bet you. He intimidated the witnesses. See, that's what he does. That's his style. CPS had no choice. Tonight. You and me. Snazzy night out. Alvin Stardust. Bop till you drop. I saw her, Annie. I know what's going to happen to Eve. I know what kind of life is waiting for her with him. Believe me, there's plenty of others he's going to destroy as well. If Crane is behind these attacks, then eventually the investigation's gonna take you to him. No, CID won't listen, it's a waste of time. Well, if it's so awful, then why are you still here? Believe me, I wake up every morning and I ask myself the same question. You know why you're here. And I do too. You're lucky, Sam. At least in CID you have a chance to make a difference. And you do. - Do I? - Yeah. And to me, you do, too. What is it, Sam? Is he all right? It's all right, he's OK. He's fine, it's just a stomach upset. I'll get you some water. -His airway was disconnected. -Well, he's stable now. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Doctor. You were lucky that time, Tyler. Now your life's in my hands. And your luck is running out. Who were you ringing, Sam? Hey. Wait a minute. Crown chips. Look. In the picture. Crown chips. He said he'd never used Crown chips. - Maybe he forgot he had them... - It gives us an excuse, doesn't it? It gives us an excuse to start kicking doors down. Come on. You're such a div, Chris. - It's shit. It'll never work. - Never, ever. - All right, boss? - What do you call these again? - Stringer. - Stinger. And these stop cars, yeah? You're a right Caractacus Potts, aren't you, boss? I didn't invent it. Oh, actually, I suppose I just did. Anyway, come on. Car. Now. Oh, that's right. Leave the plonk to tidy up. We should square this with the Guv. We don't have time to go round every boozer in town. - We don't even have a warrant. - It's never stopped you before. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Easy does it. Where's your boss? Well, I've found the... Guv. What the hell's going on? I'm thirty nicker up! Where's Crane? - What's going on now? - Ray? Tony Crane, you are under arrest. You are barking up the wrong tree. It's gonna fall on you. He lied to us about the chips he used. They're the same as the one on the murder scene. Mr Hunt? We'll continue this down at the station. Chris, cash in for me. I'll call me lawyer. He might get held up. - Boss... - Hey, let him go. Just tread carefully, Gene. The press are breathing down our necks. Ah. Work together on this one, eh? Good lad. Crane knows the law. That's why the Fraud Squad could never get him. Fraud... Squad? Since when? The Yard checked the prints on the hammer. Weren't proper prints at all. It's a blank. So no link to Crane. He lied about the Crown chips. - He's guilty! - Doesn't add up. That young Turk bumping off everybody who has a cracking hand at baccarat? We have to nail him. You forced me up onto a pedestal for everyone to see. The press, the public, Harry Woolf. Now you're throwing eggs at me. Lean on him, Guv. Just lean on him. This is the brief. What do you want us to do to him... er... do with him? I lied about the Crown chips. I should have done this sooner. I've got to hand it to you, Crane. That's one hell of a bribe. Silver strip looks like tinfoil. Paper's too rough. Fake. Been running through our books for three weeks. Someone's using the casino to launder. What, and you've only just noticed? Cashiers picked up on the early notes, but, er... then it got harder to spot. All right. OK, look. George Rills were at the club the other night. I lied in order to buy myself time for... an internal enquiry. How grown-up of you. Tell me, what were the findings of this enquiry? Police know there's funny money about, they start kicking in doors. I need to keep my business running. So these forgers panicked when they realised there were a lot of toy notes getting out. Then they went after the punters with the big wins. Like George Rills. I've done as much as I can to find these fellas. It's up to you boys now. You're a liar. Heavy night, boss? Why don't you just go and count some paper clips, Phyllis? - You all right? - I'm all right. Hey. Be seeing you. I was happy to put some scrote down to buy us time. And I thought YOU were the one who had the principles. Oh, yes. I'll be seeing you. Tyler. What's wrong with you? We're gonna put in a forger. Follow the fake cash. Where are you going? Tyler! She begged me to stop. - Are you gonna do the same? - No! - Come on, Tyler, beg for your life. - No... Just like she did. Sam? Hey, watch it. - I'm blind. - How can you be blind? I'm blind! - Can you see anything at all? - Just a blur. My head's splitting. It's a migraine. Oh, wait. Oh. Oh, you're back. You're back. How can I save Eve if I can't even save myself, Annie? You know what your problem is? You think you can do it all. I don't have a choice. Right, McKee, are you saying there are no forgers working in this city? I'd stake my life on it. That leaves you, then. Now hang on... What's in your garden shed these days? - Lawnmowers. - Magic lawnmowers that print money? - I'm retired. - We'll take a look, shall we? Sam? Crane has fed you a sidewinder. You waste your time with this forger if you want. I know what I've got to do. Oi! You're coming with me, and that's an order. - Piss off. - We follow the money. While there is breath left in my body, I am going to try to save Eve and all the others that he is going to kill one day. Judge wouldn't agree, jury wouldn't agree, press wouldn't agree, Super wouldn't agree. I don't agree with you. My budgie wouldn't agree with you! You have nothing but your bloody ego. You should be cock-a-bloody-hoop! We're doing this the Hyde way. Do you want to know about Hyde? Do you want to know where I really come from? This team is a joke. Go on, walk out. Give me an excuse to kick the crap out of you! I've wasted enough time already. - Don't touch me. - Look at me. Look me in the eyes and tell me that you don't doubt him sometimes. Come on. You see it, don't you? The darkness in him? We all have a dark side, Inspector. He treats you like a princess and he shows you love and dignity, and so you take the rough with the smooth. But as time goes on, it gets worse, and... and the dark side gets darker, so you drink and you take pills to blot it all out. I don't take anything. What kind of freaky... And your precious life goes down the toilet one pill at a time. And then one day... ...far from now, when you're tired and drained and you're rattling like a chemist's shop, you see one horror too many and you call me. And Tony Crane brutally rapes you and then batters you to death. If I can save you, then who knows, maybe I can save myself, because he's going to get me too. We're in this together, me and you, Eve. You are insane. This is just like the one stolen from George Rills. - Put this in Tony's desk drawer. - Why? So that when I lead a police raid in about an hour, I'll find it. You'd fit him up? I would never fit anybody up who didn't... ...who didn't deserve it. No. I won't do it. Do this one thing for me, Eve, and I promise you, your life is just beginning. Bastard. No, not a bastard. Just a copper. Hello, Inspector. Planting evidence? Printing money and laundering it through your own casino. Was it McKee? But he's getting old, isn't he? His stuff's not quite good enough. So when George Rills walked out with a wedge of it, you panicked. You're the one should be panicking. You're finished. What's funny? You like cards, Tony. Why don't we put them on the table? You know, don't you? - Know what? - Come on. - D'you want me to say it? - That'd be nice. You know that I'm lying in intensive care, 30 years in the future. You see, I had a car accident and I woke up here. But you, the rich, powerful, 21st-century you, is sitting by my bedside tormenting me. You'll turn off my life support and have me found dead by the nurses. Now, is this ringing any bells? You will forgive me if this sounds like you're clutching at straws. Clutching at straws is a career option these days. OK, maybe I'm not in a coma. Maybe I'm just mad. But at least I can try to save Eve. And all the others that you are going to kill. - I'm not a killer. - Oh, come off it, Tony. You were born a monster. You just don't know it yet. What are you gonna do? Arrest me for a crime I might commit 30 years in the future? Your DCI'll throw you out. You think we're the Boy Scouts? We're the police! We can have you serving life so fast your feet won't touch the ground. Hunt won't go along with that. Then you don't know Gene Hunt. Well, it's a crying shame, because I actually liked him. It's me. Get the copper as well. Phil. Show the Inspector out. Please, please, no, no! Once we're out of this pickle, we'll arrest everybody. You, too, Boris! I didn't say owt. He just wanted to look in the shed! - Somebody help me! Stop! - Don't! - Stop! - Don't do this. Lads! Please, please. No, no! This is not like George Rills. This is premeditated. Step away! No! You were right. Maybe I won't kick ten types of shit out of you later. - If you'd backed me, maybe... - I bloody did! We would have got evidence to lead us to Crane eventually! It was done by the book until you rewrote it! What choice did I have? I was on my own. I'm always on my own! Oh, it's my turn next, is it? Oh, lucky me! We thought you'd like to die together. Wait, wait, wait, wait! I'm dying for a smoke. How about a cigarette, lads? A last request and all that? Er, cig... cigarette. Cigareta? Please, please. You're going to have to bury us soon. It's hard graft. Not in any hurry, are you? Eh? Top pocket. OK. You'll both be dead soon. Thank you, thank you. Sorry. Oi, come on. Those things'll kill you. Crane! Tyler, what's wrong with you? I can't... I can't, Guv. Just go. Go. Come on. Come on. Come on! Shit! Ray, you beauty. When you didn't show, we thought we'd better have a look over here. Good call, Sergeant. There's 38 stone of Hungarian laid up there. No sweat. We'll cuff him ready for Uniform. Phyllis, give me an eyeball on a green GT6, L reg, heading west into the city from Cedar Road direction. Now where? It's over. You're no longer the hero. Look at you. You're powerless. You couldn't save Eve and no one will save you. This is it, Tyler. Alpha One to Romeo Foxtrot. Over. Go ahead, Phyllis. Green GT6 spotted entering the textile district. I need all the cars you've got. We have to close him down. Should be entering from the Drake Road end. Right, we're on it. We're in Ash Road. We'll cut him off by the gasworks. I'm pulling in officers off the street and I'm re-routing all our units as fast as I can. This is it, Tyler. What's up with you? I'm dying. Rubbish. I feel like you do every Sunday morning. Right, you lot. Close off that street. I don't want anyone getting through. Right you are, Guv. Stop. What are you doing? What are you doing? No! - You're nicked. - Get out. - Stringer. - Stinger. That's the one. He's still got us by the short and curlies. We've got no evidence. We could cut the henchmen a deal if they finger Crane. We're in the public glare, so I have to make this watertight. - Excuse me, sir? - Not now, love. Grown-up talk. I heard him order the attack on you and McKee. - At least, I took that to mean... - No evidence. Excuse me. Can you not see our lips moving, sweetheart? We rack up the pressure on him, hold him on remand... What with? No evidence. Excuse me. I did some work. On the crime scene. Might help. Er, Heather... WPC Jones helped me. I just thought that seeing as one of Crane's henchmen used an inhaler... Insert for a disc breather. For asthmatics. Oh, I'm being stupid, aren't I? Proper little Nancy Drew. There's a link between the muggings, the counterfeit racket and Crane. We won't get him on first-degree murder. But we can imply a link to manufacture and laundering, so we could get him for accessory to manslaughter. - That's not good enough. - Ten years. Good enough for me. He'll plea-bargain. He'll get six, be out in three. He's got the money to make it happen. We haven't stopped him becoming a killer. I need him in for life, Gene. Are you listening to me? Life! From the murder scene. Hungarians must have been behind the whole operation. - You know, forging the money. - In your casino? You have nothing that ain't circumstantial or circumspect. A jury'd rather believe us, pal. Not when they hear your DI were trying to fit me up. I have a croupier who'll take the stand on that. A man was murdered on your premises. I'll bet a few have died here. It don't mean you arranged it. You're looking at a ten-stretch, Tony. Oh, this case is a leaky vessel. But I'll tell you what'll sink it. Your DI is insane. Oh, yes, he is totally loco. Go on, Sam. Get it off your chest. You know you want to. What's he on about, Sam? Sam Tyler is from the future. Oh, yes. He's a time traveller, sort of. Go on, tell them the truth. They know you're not right in the head. You can't hide it any more. Tell 'em. I'm from... thirty years in the future. He has a car accident, he wakes up here. And there's another Tony Crane. He's in the future and he's trying to kill him. Tyler destroys my incredible empire, so I find him in a coma and I decide I'm going to torture him to death. I mean, that is bloody good, that. It gets worse. I made all of you lot up. You're all a figment of my imagination. You people, a fantasy created by him. So... ...my DI told you all this? Actually... Mr Crane told me this. Don't start playing games, Tyler. 'Cause you are clinically insane. That's enough to get this thrown out. Where did he get all these ideas from, Sam? You're telling me you don't know he's cracked? Come on, you know he is. Come on. Mr Hunt, get a doctor's report on him. Should I? Sam? Well, Guv, if you believe what Mr Crane is saying about me, then by all means release him. You have evidence to assemble a case and go to court. On the other hand, it would take a seriously disturbed individual to... to come up with such a bizarre excuse ...in order to discredit the arresting officer. Speed this up. I'm in a hurry to post bail. Mr Hunt, DI Tyler thinks he's from the future. Cuckoo. Mr Crane. I think you need to take a seat and wait quietly for the doctor... Hey, you can't! This is assault! No, it's clinical detention, for your own safety. - Under... - Section 9 of the Mental Health Act. - Get the doc in here with a big... - Bastard big. Bastard big sedative. Once the doc's satisfied you need treatment under... - Section 12. ...you'll go to a secure hospital. - No doctor'll sign that. - They always do when I tell 'em to! - Come on! - No! I'll be out of there! You can't stop me! Wait! I just did. Bastard! You bastard! I know the truth. I know the truth! I'm going to round up the press and make a statement. Cartwright. - It's not fair on my patients. You may be able to prevent death, Richard, but you can't stop me falling in love with you. I'm going back to my wife, Judy. It's for the best. Oh, don't cry. I do hate to see you cry. I don't know how he got in. He attacked the equipment. Sam was disconnected for 15 minutes. It's amazing he managed to hold on. Who was it? Psychiatric outpatient. Institutionalised since 1973, apparently. Don't you stay locked away that long, Sam. Come back to us. Find a way to get rid of whatever's holding you in there and come back. I can't come back to you now, Judy. My mind is made up. He wasn't perfect. No one is. Go make yourself a great life. OK? The casino security team have been arrested in connection with two murders. We're currently investigating Tony Crane's involvement in a counterfeiting racket. I can't say any more at this stage, on the advice of Mr Crane's doctor and quack... What? Psychiatrist. Needless to say, this was very much down to a team effort. Nancy Drew couldn't hold a candle. OK, everyone. I want you lot to know that today I was proud to be a part of this team. And the team's about to grow. I've found our new DC. Bring 'em in, then. Oi, oi! Shut up, you lot. WDC Cartwright. Nice one. Get out of the uniform, then. Nice arse, love. Like suet in a bag. Give her till tomorrow teatime, then offer her her uniform back. She'll bite your hand off to take it. Won't you, love? - Tyler. - Sam? I know you can't talk to me right now. - I just wanted to say... - I hear you. I can always hear you. I know you can hear me, Sam. But I need you to listen. What? Wait, how... how can we be talking? - I need you to get me out of here. - We will. I understand your frustration, Sam. The job's almost done. - Don't blow it now. - Job? If they find out why you're really there, you'll never make it back. Once we've dealt with it all, you can come home, Sam. - Operator. - Yes, this is, er... DI Tyler. - Who was I just talking to? - One moment, sir. You were connected to Hyde 2612. Is that all, sir? Thanks. So... this is our team, is it? Yeah, this is our team.
