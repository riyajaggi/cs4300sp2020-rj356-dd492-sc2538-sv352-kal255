 Vital signs are stable. You scared us, Sam. We thought you were losing the will to live. Give me your hand. This is just my mind, trying to keep me here. I'm here. Help me. What should I do, Annie? Stay. Real. Unreal. Real.

 Unreal. - Get back here! - Right behind you, boss! Sorry, love. You're under arrest, Trent! What were you gonna do? Jump in the canal and swim for freedom? Get off him! He's got a verruca! Kim Trent, I'm arresting you on suspicion of armed robbery. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your... No, that's not it, is it? You have the right to remain silent... You're nicked! There's no badge down there, Sammy-boy.

 Mind you, does tickle open a few doors, eh? Come on! My name is Sam Tyler. I had an accident and I woke up in 1973. Am I mad? In a coma? Or back in time? Whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet. Now maybe if I can work out the reason, I can get home. Give us me clothes, a brew and a bun, if you'd be so kind. - Nice play, guv. - This is an abortion of justice. Chris, get on the blower to C Division, D Division, tell 'em all that Hunt says they couldn't catch a cold. We got ourselves Kim Trent. Might pin a medal on your chest. Never thought of that. Enjoy it while it lasts, boys, 'cause this is fantasy time. - Phyllis, where d'you want this one? - Number two. You can't put him in there. Two pints of vomit in there this morning. Oh, didn't know you were running the desk, Nelson. Come on, you can't put him in with the carrot chunks. He'd be delighted to go to interview though. Cell two. Right. Sam. Oh. Yeah. Sorry. Okay. Bookmakers in Baker Road, two days ago. ?836 taken from the safe. Tasty haul. Best of luck to them, whoever they are. Not me. I'm just back in Manchester to visit relatives. If you were Pinocchio, you'd have just poked my eye out. You've been spotted recently with your known accomplices. Gordon Bricks, aka "Brixter", and Freddy Wilson. Now, we have reason to suspect you three carried out the Baker Road job on Saturday. I like your manners. You think this is funny? Look at these. These people were beaten and kicked. This woman is in her sixties. This bloke was whipped with knotted rope while he unlocked the safe. We know you did it, Kim. So who were you meeting at the baths? Wilson and Brixter? Planning one last blag before you go? Doing the front crawl ain't a crime, Mr Hunt. - You were born, that's the crime. - Where's the next robbery? Just tell us. Look. I admit it. I got form. But honestly, boys, I'm just up here to see my auntie. Liar. Can you account for your whereabouts last Saturday? Cookery classes. I'm having it off with Fanny Craddock. Snooker tournament! Feeding the ducks! Pictures! You got nothing! We found this about your person. Bookies always keep a big float on a major race day and they get the bank to mark the notes, don't they, Kimmy? We know you pinched this dough. There you go. What a surprise. Didn't see that coming. I've never seen that money before in my life! Guv? Can I have a word? What are you playing at? Those notes aren't from the bookies. Worth a punt though. Look. When Trent and his boys hit the city, it's always a couple of jobs, bang bang, in, out. They've done one, we can stop them doing the other. - Great, a fit-up. - Cells! I'm just trying to keep things mov... does it matter?! I'm not going back in that cell, it stinks. - Put us in another one. - I'll tell you what. I'll have a little think about that while you think about where Freddy and Brixter are hiding, okay? Nothing puts things right quite like a punch, does it? That's the second time this morning it's slipped off. I can't tell Frank it doesn't fit. Gorgeous though, isn't it? Can one of you clean out cell two? It's disgusting in there. We don't do cells, WPCs do cells, sorry. Yeah, of course not. Thanks. Well, I might be able to splash a bit of Dettol in there later. Is that alright, sir? Yeah, that's.. - You're a diamond. What's your...? - June. I'd take that back to the jeweller's if I were you. Well, that was fun. What shall we do later, take a cattle prod to his testes? Alright, he called our bluff. The money didn't work. You could try nailing him with some real evidence. You wanna see evidence that will secure us a real conviction? Aladdin's cave. There's 200 quid's worth of drugs here. We plant them on him, watch him grow into a big flower of justice. For God's sake, guv... - Let's not resort to this. - Gotta charge him today, Sam. Gotta keep that bloke off the streets. - This place is like Guantanamo Bay. - Give over, it's nothing like Spain. I'm not letting Trent go. No, the judge'll do that, at the trial. Don't have much faith in us, do you, pal? Gary Cooper nearly come down then! You want to kick a ball about, do it in the corridor! Sorry, guv. Go on then. How do you do this where you come from? Where I come from? Yeah, Hyde, your old division, you brain donor. Well, in "Hyde", we don't traditionally keep acid and knocked-off bling in our offices just so we could get home early. - So you wouldn't have pulled him in? - Not without evidence. Not even if you knew people out there were in real danger? People are always in danger, guv. One minute you're going about your business, the next, bang! taken out by a speeding car. Well, I've taken that speeding car off the road. For good. Have you got a lawyer? See you back here tomorrow. When we've got more evidence. Tatty-bye. It was an unsafe conviction. I'll level with you, guv. I don't know how long I'm gonna be here. But while I am... But when we get him, it'll be watertight. And I tell you, I'll be the first to crack open the Scotch. Are they all like you in Hyde? Must be a bloody dangerous place. Can we do this somewhere else, boss? Ignore them. Chris. Look at me. I'm still your DI on this. Now, we're gonna re-interview the staff in the bookies at Baker Road, so, make a list of who we're seeing before. - Drag 'em back in, right? - "Dragging" is not necessary. We'll talk to them there. "Talk.. there." If you bring people into the station, they just freak out, they don't think clearly. But we don't want them thinking clearly. We wanna trip 'em up. Chris, these are not suspects. These are witnesses to an armed robbery. Yeah. "Witnesses... not... suspects". There. Big letters. And get IDs on Trent, Brixter and Wilson. Get the faces out to stations, bus depots... even airports. You know, go national. Heathrow. - Where's that? - Heathrow? London. London Airport? But that's not in our district. Just get the faces out there. What? Why've you put tapioca pudding on your beefburger? Thought it was horseradish. Tyler! Blag in progress, jewellers, Bitman Road, move it! Where's plod? Oi, oi, oi, drop it! Get on your knees! Get down! - See a car? - No. You breathing? - Almost, yeah. You? - Yeah. - Oh god. - June... Keep hold of my hand, love, just keep squeezing, that's it, good stuff. June, it's not as bad as it seems, I promise. Be careful with her, will you? Her BP's plummeting. She's lost a lot of blood. Breathing's shallow. Think she'll need saline. Did you hear what I said? I'm not a doctor, chief. I'm the ambulance driver. I want this mess tidied up tonight. And I want this cleared away. I don't want any of her left lying on the street. Get rid of all these people. Alright, move away! There's nothing to see. I'll wait until... forensics... Here. Slipped right off her finger. She came to the jewellers to get it... Clean it up! I want you to clean it up! She works at the station. She's one of us. I want to be able to look her dad in the eye and say you cleaned up every drop of her precious blood. Get off me! This entire place is cracked! You can't blame me, you lunatic bastard! You were wrong! I didn't do this! They did it! The diamonds they took were only in the safe for one day. They had to hit it today. I had Trent today, and you let him go to prove a point! We had no evidence! I'm better than any of this! Says you. He moved! Probably an involuntary muscle spasm brought about by dehydration. ...what course of action to take. These cases are very complex. The body takes time to adapt. But not nearly as much time as the mind. - Take his blood chemistry. - Yes, doctor. He was given saline yesterday. It should have taken effect by now. Miss Johnson. Barbara. Won't you at least consider coming with me to Canterbury? You know how I feel about you. Why does it have to be now, Nelson? Why this particular year? - What you saying, mon brave? - '88 was a good vintage. Year I graduated from the Force. Colour television. Central heating. It was like bloody Star Trek compared to this. Can I change it? I'll have 1988 please, quick as you like! I don't mind staying, if that's how it's gotta be, but please can I have a year that's AD, as opposed to BC! Game on. These cuts are getting worse, you know, man. Mr Heath had better sort himself out. Gimme a Scotch. Double, massive. Half a bottle. Sam, you can't stay here. Great. No worries. Send me back. They're coming down here to get bladdered. Gene finds you, mood he's in, he'll... What's he gonna do, put me in a coma? Perhaps it's best you went. You've got to make the best of things, my friend. I've made the best of things. Give us a bottle of house red, take away. - They're coming. - Best go the back way. Sam! Nelson, deck of cards and a bottle of blended. Coming up. Are you upset? I'm more than upset. I'm comatose. I think you should go home. Love to. - Can't. - Give over! If we're back to that again, then prove to me that this is all rubbish. That I'm rubbish. Nothing but a stupid fantasy. Go on, throw yourself under a bus. Don't! Well, thought about it. What about what just happened? June... That fake? She not real? Suppose right now, that'd suit you... Shut up. Let me take you home, Sam. Back to your... fake flat. You know what I was thinking? I was thinking about what I'd do if I went back in time. Oh, great. You could put bets on things, couldn't you? Annie, I was four. I was still playing with Tonka toys. I know you're trying to sort things out, but hiding in here, drinking wine, isn't gonna do it. You have to go back to work. Give it a day or two, talk to DCI Hunt. - I've got nothing to say to him. - You went against him. I mean, if he had his way, - from what I hear... - What? I'm not blaming you. You made a decision. And June's lying in an 'ospital bed because I didn't listen to Gene Hunt, is that what you're trying to say? I know people here are tight with each other, but... they have to be. You have to believe in the people around you. That would be nice. Goodnight. What are you smirking at, Mona Lisa? I'm sorry you're lonely, Sam. Are you really lonely here? No no no, I'm not listening. Don't you think it can be lonely out there too? In the white room that's too warm? - Stop it. - Life goes on. But does it really go on for the sleeping man? - I'm not sleeping, I'm here! - And isn't it better here, where you can be busy? Look, just.. just get out! Do you not like me with my clown? I can see I make you frown... When on earth will all this end? I'm your friend, your only friend. Get out! It is a bit big, innit? If you've come to interview her, guv, she... Oh, that feels better. What on earth is going on? - Police officers. - Police officers. Oh, you are joking me. I love this city. Its mess. Its noise. Prozzies. Drunks. Stray dogs, little old men. Buttered crumpets for tea. You're a right smart Alec and all, not squeaky clean, nor's this place. Rest of this country couldn't give a threepenny bit about this town. The orphans take whoever they can get to look after them. That's me. So you want me out now. Are you joking? You got to put this right. - I only know one way to police. - So do I. She's not giving up and nor should you. Come on, gentlemen. On your way now. Right you are, Matron. - Come back when she's stronger. - Yes... When her mum and dad come to visit, tell them not to stop talking to her, okay? Come on. I don't believe this. Right, let's pull in anyone who was in Bitman Road around 1 o'clock yesterday! We have no ID on the getaway car, but I want you checking out wasteground, breaker's yards, landfill sites, looking for a vehicle that's very recently been dumped. Come on then, what are you waiting for? Shake this out! Thank you for your help, sir. I won't be keeping you. I know you wanna get back to your shop, - a lot of clearing up to do. - I have rather. Thanks very much. Talked to everybody on the street, but it's like Whitby fish market out there. - What? - Lot of clams. Who's that? Tits in a jumper. May be a result. Guv, this lady has got an office overlooking the shop. Hiya, love. Now, I don't want you to be scared, but... get it off your chest. I told you, I saw nothing. I can't see what good I'm doing here? Listen, love, I'm the policeman, I'll decide if you're a help or not, ok? And we need witnesses. How else are we gonna get... abreast of the case? Well, as they were running out, the first one tripped. That's all I saw. Was he the one holding the bag? - I think it was, yeah. - Can you remember which hand? Right. Okay. Thanks for your help. Come on, love, we'll get you on a bus. Chris, any joy with forensics? Well, it's tied up at the lab. Sod it. Start threatening people with obstruction. - Usually jogs a few memories. - That's likely to make people even more scared of coming forward if they do know something. Come on then, Brainiac. Surprise us with your new way of policing. That woman just said the first one to leave the shop slipped. Now, do you know why that's important? - No. - I do. Because the manager said the raider holding the bag took off his left glove. So he could zip it up. What? Stop! Where do you feel like putting your left hand? - Suppose this pipe. - Don't touch it. Need to get it dusted for prints. But forensics are tied up at the moment. Can't get down there for another 3 hours. Hey, you fancy a 99, boss? Just.. get the prints, Chris. If you can't take Mohammed to the mountain... How many prints have you put on that pipe between you? - Bugger. - Yeah. Right. Hang on, where're you going? I'm gonna pull Trent in. His lawyer will throw the book at you, guv. I'll plant a blood-stained dagger on him. I'm gonna nick him for every outstanding crime in the division, including the Maple Lane Poisonings of 1883. Alright, beat a confession out him. It won't be worth the bus fare to court. I've never fitted anyone up who hadn't deserved it. Sorry. Hang on, police. Hold it there. Oi, he said stop right there, deaf-aid! What's happened to your cart? Cart? Nothing. You were here yesterday at the time of the robbery. What's your name? - What - is - your - - Leonard Pit! Did someone run into your cart, Leonard? Is this car paint? That's recent. What's that noise?! Ruining my cuppa! Oh, don't fret, Phyllis. It's him. Lieutenant Uhura. Well, rip it out of his ear before it ruins our radios. Annie, could you get Mr Pit a cup of tea? He's a key witness. So could you treat him like a person, Phyllis? Do you remember people? - You used to be one. - Not bad for you, boss. - There you go. - Thanks. Okay, you were in Bitman Road, at around one o'clock. - A car draws up... - Just relax, lad. No one's gonna come in and blow your brains out. Leonard. Please, okay? A black car, yeah? Ford. Granada. Registration? E... Don't know. Sorry, was that like, you saying the letter E, and you don't know the rest, or was that like you saying "Ee, I dunno"? Did you see the men in the car? No. Wow, you are dead impressive, Leonard, you know that? No, you are, you're... ...not wor... Give it a... Take your time, Leonard, take your time. Now, there aren't any skid marks on the road, so if these guys were going fast enough - to lose control... - Look, I've heard enough. Okay, listen. A girl was shot, she's critical. They hit you. They hit your cart deliberately, didn't they? Was it a threat? A warning? Talk to me. He didn't have his mask on. He was talking to the other two. I saw his face. Now, I know some of you don't like the way I do things, and I know some of you blame me for yesterday. But if we all pull together, we can put Trent and his gang away forever. We have a witness who can ID Trent, and place him in the car. So let's pull him in. Piece of scum bastard scum! Dare you! Dare you treat me like this! You filthy, stinking, pig-sucking, rotten, bleeding filth! You're filth! Rotten, bloody filth! Your mum's filth, and your kids are filth! Mrs Trent, why don't you just tell us where we can find your nephew? - Piss off! - Look, if you help me, then I can call him off. Oh dear. You filthy pervert nonce pig! Why don't you just give us a name, love, eh? Pub called the Coachman! - Coachman. - Smashing. Thanks for your help, love. You're a set of bastards, both of you, do you know th... Shut up. White dog shit. Takes me back. I've got 20 people who swear I was in that boozer all day yesterday. We'll see, laughing boy. Don't break his arm, Ray. Well, don't lose your bottle again, boss, eh? Or we'll all be in the shit. Ray doesn't like me, does he? It's just, he was going for Inspector, and then when you turned up, it sorta... No, he hates your guts, boss. What about you, Chris? Do you think I'm going about things the right way? Dunno, I suppose. Right, he's ready. Okay, Leonard. This bloke won't be able to touch you. You'll be standing behind special glass, so he won't even be able to see you. Take your time. Don't you move. None. What? - It's none of 'em. - Leonard! Special glass? If you give me a bit of time with him, - I think I can gain his trust. - Gain his trust? What does he think he is? No, I'm gonna throw the book at the little gobshite. See how he likes being banged up for obstructing the course of justice. What's the point in terrifying him? He needs to feel secure. - It's okay, Leonard. - Never trust a copper! What you on about? "I'm gonna throw the book at the little gobshite"!? You can lipread. - Sorry you had to hear that. - He didn't. He saw it. Nice one, guv. So he wants to feel all nice and safe, well, tough! He's witness to a robbery. - What if we offer him immunity? - From what, measles, mumps, what? Witness protection. Right now, the only person he needs protecting from is me. I need to know what you saw. Now, you're gonna have to trust me, okay? I'm not like the rest of them. I wanna go home. Let me show you something. Take a good look. This is what he did to her. She's still critical. Now, if you can formally identify Kim Trent as the man in that car, we can arrest him, and his accomplices, and then that's it. They'll be inside. I can guarantee you total protection. Now, will you help me? Good man. Now, I need you to take a ride with me and see if we can find Trent and identify him. - No! - Relax, relax. I'm talking about travelling incognito. I just point? You don't even have to point. If you see Trent, just tap the side of the van. That's a formal identification. - Can I have an ice cream? - And me! Annie! Leonard is our star witness in the Bitman Road robbery. He needs looking after tonight. Oh, aye? Don't like the sound of that. Just look after him til morning. I'll stick a CID car outside as well. It'll only be a few hours. Then, first light, bring him in to the station. Double bubble? Double time, yeah. Why me? I need somebody in the house I can trust. Annie's gonna sit with him tonight. Eh, Leonard! Fanny in the flat. Nice work. Thanks, Annie. He may be a laughing stock to you, but he's all we've got. Now, we'll try again tomorrow. You're betting on a handicapped who'll bolt before he gets to court. I told him we'd stick a car outside. You're taking the mick. I mean, Witness Protection? That's only used by blokes who testify against the Mafia. He needs to know that we're true to our word. What about Chris and Ray? Load of cars we've got, at least stick 'em outside. Guv? Wish I were bloody deaf! Alright then. But they won't like it. Delta Four. Are you there, Ray? Yeah. Parked up outside his flat now, boss. - Happy? - Cock-a-hoop. Just make sure you're visible at all times. - You off? - Pub. 'Course. Silly me. Big darts match tonight against C Division. Chris and Ray are outside Leonard's. Right, fine. Annie Cartwright's inside the flat with him. Isn't he a well-protected bunny. - It's worth it. - Nah, 'course it is. So, big match? - It's not your bag. - Probably not. Fine. Super-duper. 920 to Alpha One. It's probably nothing, but there was a noise round the back of the flat. Can't see anything, but stuff's been kicked over out here. Tell her to go round the front. 920, check the street, over. Going round there now. Call Ray and Chris. Alpha One to 867, come in. Nothing. Alpha One, I'm in the street and there's nothing out here. Annie? You again, eh? Checking up on us, sir? Where's DS Carling parked? Ray? I don't know. They're in a car right outside. They should be right near you now. No cars out here at all. Are you sure? Hasn't been a car out here for the last hour. Bastard! If you give him babysitting jobs, don't expect him to hang around. This is bloody Hunt! I'm going back inside. Leonard's a bit rattled. Leonard? - Annie! - 920, Annie, love? Urgent assistance required! Back-up... I need back-up! Leonard, wait! Alpha One to 920. Annie, what's happened, love? I need all units. Do it! This is a call to all units. Officer in urgent need of assistance. 56 Diduick Road on the Charter Estate. All units respond immediately! I need officers mobilised to key positions. Boss? Don't know where the key positions are. I can't read this, it's all changed! You need the guv. He knows these streets like the back of his hand. You were supposed to be protecting Leonard. Oops. Fair cop. They've got him. And Annie's there. On her own. I've sent Ray and Chris straight there. Where are you now, love? Phyllis, you're not on the phone to your sister in Blackburn. 920, state your location. I can't raise her, sir. We're gonna lose her in that estate. It's too big. She's gonna go east. That's the quickest way out of the estate. We can get bobbies to cover the junctions leading out. Keep trying. Annie, give us your position. Over. And tell all units they were last seen driving a black Ford Granada. - Three IC1 males. - Three what? - That code? - No, three white blokes. Almost certainly armed. All units to the Charter Estate. Be on the lookout for 3 white men, possibly in a black Ford Granada, armed. God, she shouldn't be out there alone, slip of a girl! No, she shouldn't. Phyllis, get all units into that estate. No. Response directives have to be clear and precise. - This is an emergency. - Especially in an emergency! The units know what they're doing, they're covering the exits. If you send them into that maze, willy-nilly, you will lose all cohesion. Look, if she goes east, where does that put her? Anywhere out here. I'll try and get hold of her and Leonard. Get uniform to hold back. And keep those exit junctions covered! Your number's 870. Wait for my signal before you move the other units in or you will lose Trent. Yeah, alright, but take one of the unmarked cars. 870 to Alpha One, I'm outside the old waterworks now. - What's happening? - I think they're inside. - Any sign of Annie or Leonard? - No. Her radio's still dead. Are you holding the units back? I said I would. Okay, the last thing we need is Trent feeling cornered, especially if he's got Annie and Leonard. I'm going in. Shit! Are you alright? Are you hurt? Didn't know what'd happened to you. The battery's out on my radio. - Where's Leonard? - I lost him. They might have got him. They've got all sorts of weapons and they mean business. Leonard's smart. If they haven't found him, he'll be hiding. We need to get to him first. What if they have got to him? Wait! Leonard! Oh, God, you had us worried! Turn your hearing aid down. - You alright? - Okay. Go! Down there! Sam! Round them up, Brix. We're in the waterworks. Send all units. Guv! Brixter?! There's a way out! Come on! Drop the gun. Or what? You're gonna arrest us? You, the bird and the spastic? Yeah. For armed robbery and attempted murder. Place is surrounded. By who? They've left you on your own. And from what I've seen, your DCI'll be glad to get shot of you. Bet you wish you'd left us in that cell now. No. Leonard, stay behind me. We'll protect you. Face down! You know what, Mr Tyler? I'm gonna be leaving you till last. That way, you get to see what happens. - You're nicked, Trent. - Drop it! Get off us! Come on, let me go! You don't have to say anything, just point. Bloody power cuts. You didn't have to do that. You said you'd protect us. And you did. You all did. Which one are you? All three. Look, I was thinking, guv. I know having me here is difficult for you. What if I went back? To Hyde? Is that possible? I'll get on the blower. You can do that? Send me back to where I came from? Hello, is that the Wizard of Oz? The Wizard'll sort it out. It's because of the wonderful things he does. You were transferred here, Sam, at your own request. I didn't ask for you. You wanted to come. And the doctors say you're off the critical list now. You'll be out in plenty of time to enjoy that wedding of yours. Is that urine? I'll get someone. Damnit. Hello? I can't open the door. Can somebody help me? - What've you done? - Nothing. Then why's his life support's shut down? It's not my fault. My God. Who's that? Look. Here's his catheter. It's leaked down the bed. It's gone into the electrics. Help me! Somebody open the door! I need to get out! He's in distress. Get the doctor! This is what happens when he's left on his own too long. Please, somebody help me! Open the door. - Hold on, Sam. - What? What? Let's get this back in for you. I need to get out, help me! Help! Gene! I'm switching it back on. There! Hey, pilgrim. Give me a Scotch. Don't fancy going out there tonight. Stay in here a while, man. Shake yourself down. Be cool. You deserve it. You've been busy. You in, Tyler? 50p gets you a chair. I'm gonna take a leak. Sure you're in? Deal me.
