 Life on Mars (2006â€“2007): Season 2, Episode 3 - Episode #2.3 - full transcript 
 Manchester is beset with bomb threats that Gene readily pins on the IRA, but Sam's knowledge of history makes him doubt Gene's assertion. However, messages from 2006 and a grave mistake in 1973 are giving Sam reason to question his own judgment.

 #How can I be sure # In a world that's constantly changing - # How can I be sure... - (STATlC CRACKLES) # Where I stand with you? (MUSIC BREAKS UP IN STATIC) (CLASSICAL MUSIC) (MAN)..a case of... (MAN) We can find triangles in any other quadrilateral by simple bisection. When we draw an angle through a rectangle, we of course reveal two triangles.

 One angle will always be 90 degrees. - Simple. - Wouldn't get too smug, mate. You'II be replaced by the Iovely Lorraine Kelly. I've treated other cases exactly like Sam's. Exact in every way. And in each case, it was a full recovery with no cognitive functions affected for the long term. Why should being comatose this long have any mental side effects? (MAN # 2) The mind's fragile. Who's to say what's been damaged? Maybe not cognitive skills, but other things. - His sense ofjudgement? - There's no evidence of a decline. What are you basing your theory on? Guesswork? No, Dr Matthews, it's called instinct. Instinct?

 I'm telling you, he's not going to come out of this all there. Don't Iisten to him. He's talking bollocks. He's basing this on a hunch, for Christ's sake. What do you think, Sam? How's your sense ofjudgement? Jesus, just tell me my brain will be all right. Say something. Come on. Come on! (KNOCKS AT DOOR) Sam? It's me, Annie. Now, we don't have to stop at the one bisection. Take the cube. The cube offers us numerous possibilities for liberating as a geometric shape. Guv's waiting outside. Phyllis just took a call. IRA. A bomb's been planted outside a school. We've got 1 5 minutes. Dynamite. Shit. Ooh. Hang on a minute. Dynamite? (GUITAR-BASED ROCK MUSIC) (CHRIS) Why blow up our city? Why can't they blow up somewhere else, like Cleethorpes? Guv, this doesn't make sense. What part of "will explode in 1 5 minutes" can't you grasp? It can't be the IRA. They don't use dynamite. They never will, or... I mean, have. (SAM) That bomb Iast month in London? Weedkiller and sugar. That's their hallmark. They use homemade explosives, not dynamite. It's not the IRA. It's not a bomb. - (MAN) Come on, girls, hurry up! - Quickly, move it. Quick, quick! AII right, Iove. - Any news from Bomb Squad? - They're still engaged, Guv. BIoody hell. It's over ten minutes. - I make it nearly ten. - I make it nearly eleven. I make it eleven and three seconds. You sure yours is right? Might be a delay on it. Give it a few more minutes. There isn't a delay on it, because there isn't a bomb. - It's a hoax. - What, and you're sure? No other political groups are bombing mainland Britain in 1973. Fact. Trust me on this. I know it. I know this. What the hell do I have to do to get you people to believe me? Well, if you're so sure, boss, why don't you go over and check it out? AII right, I will. Do anything to try and impress you, wouldn't he? It's not about impressing anyone, you moron. Whatever you say, boss. Oh, no, I get it. I get it. You want to be the hero, don't you? Well, go on, then, big man, it's all yours. - I didn't say that. - What, has your bottle gone (?) (GENE) When you've quite finished, Iadies. No, you're all right. I haven't got anything to prove. - Ray. - No, he'II be OK. Won't you? Go on. (SHOUTING ECHOES) - (ANNIE) Ray! Oh, my God. - (GENE) Somebody get an ambulance! My name is Sam Tyler. I had an accident and I woke up in 1973. Am I mad, in a coma, or back in time? Whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet. Now, maybe if I can work out the reason, I can get home. (SIREN WAILS) The next time you "know" something, Tyler, you keep it to yourself. That's an order. (ANNIE) Want to give to Ray's collection? Thanks, Jeff. Here y'are. Thanks, CIive. - Is that for Ray? - Yeah. It's just his mates putting in. Annie. Look, I thought I... I know I was right. It's not the IRA. Look, I had to investigate terrorist methods as part of my training. It doesn't Iook Iike they trained you very well, does it? Look, I know about now. They've got Semtex, right? But they don't use that until 1 986, South Armagh. Mainland Britain is not until the early '90s. Early '90s? How would I know that? I remember it, that's how! Sam. I don't give a damn about Semtech. You were wrong about the hoax. You have to remember we work for each other round here, not against. When you've finished beating the walls up, some explosives have gone missing from a builder's yard in Salford. Let's see if we can investigate without endangering any officers (!) - How's Ray? - Oh, he's champion. Doing backflips on the dance floor at Rotters tonight, the usual thing you do when you've been caught in an IRA bomb blast. I still don't think it was the IRA. How do you think I spend my time here, Tyler? - Building a Death Star? - You what? Nothing. By Iistening to the cogs in the machine going round all day. Only your cog's out of sync with the rest of us. Has been since you rode in on your big Hyde horse. Now either you get in sync, or I find another cog. (GUITAR-BASED ROCK MUSIC) - Frank Miller? - That's me. DCI Hunt, DI Tyler. - Where were the explosives, sir? - Over here. - Who else has access to this yard? - AII sorts. Drivers, suppliers, contractors. How much dynamite? Fifty pound. - Enough to blow up a car? - Enough to blow up a whole building. It'd only take a couple of pounds to blow up a car. So somewhere out there, there's over forty-odd pound of dynamite waiting to go off. - When might it have been taken? - Last night. I wasn't here yesterday. Daughter's graduation. Then it could have been taken the night before Iast. No, I'm sure one of the Iads would have noticed this. They would have said something. This hasn't got owt to do with that IRA bomb going off, has it? It hasn't been confirmed that the IRA were responsible for that explosion. Anyway, better Iate than never, Mr Miller. Oh, Frank. PIease. If you want to search the place, help yourself. Only, er...maybe don't Iet on it was me that called you. It's mostly Irish fellas work for me. I don't want them getting the wrong end of the stick. I rely on them. Don't you worry, Frank. Discretion's our middle name. (COD-IRISH) Top of the morning to you, Iads. Know anything about some missing dynamite? (MUTTERING) AIpha One to base. Phyllis, get a unit over to Miller's yard. Get 'em to haul in all the Paddies for questioning. Over. Guv, if you piss off those Irish workers, you just piss off the whole community and then we'II get nowhere. We have to tread carefully. Some bastards somewhere have got over forty pound in dynamite and could blow up innocent people. Just Iike they did to Ray. And you're asking me to tread carefully. Take your own advice, Sam. Wake up and smell the cocoa. Now Iet's search this shithole and nail these Paddy bastards. It's coffee. (SIGHS) AII right then, sulky bollocks. If it wasn't the IRA or any other terrorist group, who blew up that car, then? The WI? I've no idea. (CLEARS THROAT) "Rights of Irish immigrants." Rallies, meetings... Oh, set up unions yourself. A regular Karl O'Marx by the Iooks of it. List of street names. I'II get Chris to check them out, if he's still talking to me. Well, well, well, Sammy boy. Looks Iike we might be able to stop this scum from bombing again. You know, just because he's politically active, doesn't necessarily mean he wants to start blowing everybody up. It does if he's called Patrick O'Brien, and it just so happens he hasn't turned in for work today. Back in '69, got him sent down for two years. Robbery. - So why is he suddenly a suspect? - Let's have a think, shall we? Paddy, touch of the Trotskys, more Iip than Mick Jagger, previous, happens to be working on the site where a Ioad of dynamite goes AWOL. Oh, and a bomb goes off in the city. AII right, then, genius. What's your theory? I don't have one yet. We can't just go on a hunch. Forgive me if I don't go along with your so-called facts, but I'm hoping to still be in one piece by teatime. AII I'm saying is maybe it's got nothing to do with him. And maybe Enoch Powell's throwing one up Shirley Bassey. Let me know when you're back Iiving in the real world, Tyler. If only. - AIpha One to base, come in. Over. - (PHYLLlS) Receiving you, Guv. Phyllis, tell DC Skelton and Cartwright to get a unit together. Bring in anyone who knows Patrick O'Brien. We need all the Ieads we can get on the explosives. - Get onto it. - Right you are. Phyllis, it might be an idea if they go through all the O's in the phone book. Hey, I'II tell you what, while we're at it, why don't we pull in that well-known terrorist suspect Dana? How about Val Doonican? # Mama let me out on a Saturday night # She said, now go out and get her, go and hold her tight # I said, now, Mama, you don't understand # Every time I touch her hand, it's like I'm burning in the fires of hell # And if I hold her too long, you never can tell # What'll happen to me... Guv, remember...go easy, yeah? And you remember, we don't Iet Ray down, or the people of this city. #..Trailblazer # Natural-born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah # Hello, Iove. Where is he, then? O'Brien! I know, if he was a bit more assertive, he'd go far (!) (STOMPS UPSTAIRS) Where are you, you scum? O'Brien! O'Brien? He don't Iive here any more. - Guv! - Not Iived here for months. I made him sling his hook. Never paid his Iodgings. - Where is he, then? - Down at t'alehouse. I don't know. Wherever he is, you can bet your boots he's up to no good. I wouldn't trust any of them, especially not since this bomb. I'm not Ietting one of them set foot in this house again, that's for sure. Have you actually seen Mr O'Brien do anything suspicious? Did you hear him talking to his Paddy mates? Not exactly, no. But his eyes are close together. AIways the sign of someone shifty. - You're not stopping for a brew? - No thanks, Iove. Better crack on. - We're Iooking for a Patrick... - I haven't seen him. - (IRISH MAN) BIoody filth! - Friendly bunch, aren't they? Where to now? Fiddler's Green. I hope that's the name of a pub. Change of plan. # But there's still no need to make blind children bleed # Even if what you say is true... Right. Let's get in amongst the Ieprechauns. (IRISH MAN) We're paid Iess than the English for doing the same job. But they don't want to know about our union. We shouldn't have to take this shit from these bastards any more. They kick us when we're down and we never kick back. It's time we started kicking. Well, well, this all Iooks very cosy, gents. Irish knitting circle, is it? - What do you want, Hunt? - Your bollocks nailed to a gatepost. In the meantime, you're coming with me. - (SHOUTING) - I've done nothing wrong. AII right, Iads. We just want to ask Mr O'Brien a few questions. Get your hair cut. (MAN JEERS) You're an even bigger bastard than I remember. Maybe your memory's playing tricks on you. (GRUNTS AND COUGHS) No, you're right. I am a bigger bastard. - Stand there... - Move back! Back! You Iot don't calm down, I'II make you all strip and you can stand here with your knackers out! - I could do with a Iaugh. - Another one to sign in, Phyllis. Don't mind if we push in, do you, Iads? - Nice to be back, is it, O'Brien? - Tell me, is Hunt rhyming slang? (CHUCKLES) Take him away. What's going on? I've got no men at my yard. They're all down here. I could Iose contracts. Would you say you're thorough in your work, Mr Miller? - Of course I am. - Snap. You'II have 'em back when I've finished questioning them. Most of these are decent Iads. They'd not have owt to do with the IRA. Most? What about O'Brien? Now you're putting words into my mouth. You'II be all right, Iads. I'II see you back at the yard. Remind me why we're not questioning everyone that works at Miller's and not just the Irish. Explosives fella's just been on, Guv. Dynamite for the car matches the dynamite from Miller's yard. - Same make. - That's why. Chris. Check out the Iist of street names we found in O'Brien's Iocker. - Let's nail this bastard. - OK, Guv. Right, I've got all your names. They'd better be true. Especially you, 'cause you Iook shifty. Why weren't you in work today? I had to be at the meeting. It's funny, that. Dynamite goes missing from where you work, and next day you don't show up. What have you done with it, O'Brien? - I'm saying nothing. - You're not helping yourself here. How can you prove your innocence if you won't cooperate? Who says he's innocent? Innocent until proven guilty. Does that ring any bells? The Iaw doesn't apply to maggots Iike him. Come on, O'Brien, stop pissing us about. What's your role, eh? You the monkey or the organ grinder? Who's making the calls? PIanting the bombs? I want names. Now! Two names, right? That's your Iot. That's your main man. - P McGinty? - Aye. Though his mate does all the Iegwork. Have a nasty kick, this mate? Paddy McGinty's goat. That's very clever, O'Brien. Very funny. You know, you should be on The Wheeltappers and Shunters. Except you'II be inside choking on your own porridge if I have my say in it, you twisted piece of shit. Guv, come on. - Let me hit him. Just once. - Another call's come through, Guv. Shit. IRA. Same accent. Dynamite under a car outside the Three Ships. Goes off in 15 minutes. - Code word? - There wasn't one. - Make of car? - Said it was up to us to find it. Bastards. Right, Phyllis, from now on, only you are to answer the phone. - What if I need the Iadies'? - Cross your Iegs. (POLICEMAN) Get out! Come on, move! Keep going! (GENE) Where's the bomb squad, Phyllis? They're on their way from a hoax call in Abbey Hey. They'll be with you as soon as they can. By which time it might be too Iate. - (TICKING) - Guv? Got any pliers? - You done this before? - Once. At Hyde. - And? - Well, I'm still here, aren't I? A dead moron's no use to anyone. (WHISPERS) Come on, think. OK. Come on, you know this. (GENE) No rush! Got about 22 seconds before we're all blown sky-high. It's the red. It's the red, it's got to be the red. I'm sure it is. (MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) I knew it was the red, I...I just...I couldn't... I couldn't remember. Still don't think it's down to the IRA? I'm not sure. But it can't be O'Brien making the calls. Tenner says he knows who is, though. He's involved, I know he is. How? Boss. That was one of the street names on O'Brien's Iist. You sick, evil bastard. Where's the next one going to go off? I don't know what you're talking about. - Get up. - (MOANS) Get up! You had the name of the pissing street written down. They're just streets that we did jobs on. So where are you and your IRA mates planning the next job, eh? (CRIES OUT) - (GRUNTS) - Stop. He can't. It's all you English can do. Have done for centuries. Well, I'm all for tradition, me. That's enough. - Where's the bomb? - I said that's enough! You carry on Iike this and we won't get any evidence because the suspect will be dead. You're condemning a man before he's even been tried! - Because I know he's guilty! - And what if he's innocent? What if he's sent down and the conviction's overturned? You may as well become a recruitment officer for the bloody terrorists! And as for the public's faith in the police, no one will trust us. No one! We're the police. Everybody trusts us! Not where I come from, they don't. Yeah, not if they're all bloody Iike you, eh? We need to get him to hospital. Shame you didn't show the same concern for your own colleague. I don't need this shit. I'II call an ambulance on the way out. If you think I am going to Iet you walk away from this investigation, you're in for an even bigger disappointment than the day we found out the plonk Doris Bangs was a name and not a promise. (CASH REGISTER BELL) - Usual, mon brave? - Large usual. - Coming up. - O'Brien's behind those bombs. What we have to do... (APPLAUDS) (OTHERS JOIN IN) OK? Thought the doc signed you off for a few weeks? He did. I wanted to catch the bastard that did this to me. I'm really sorry, mate. You know, up till now, Colin Bell was what I'd call a hero. Not any more. - Nelson, get the man a drink. - Cheers, Guv. - Good to have you back, mate. - You OK? Ray? You OK? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Guv. He shouldn't be here. He's got PTSD. The man's a hero and you're accusing him of having the clap. No. Post-traumatic stress disorder. I've seen it before. - He needs counselling. - He's a police officer, not a fairy. Nelson, Scotch. There you go, Raymondo. Chaser. Red Iorry, yellow Iorry, red Iorry, yellow Iorry. Red Iorry, yellow Iorry. What do you want? Red wire, yellow wire. Red wire, yellow wire. - Stop. - Come on, Sam. You try it. Red wire, yellow wire. Come on. You know everything, Sam. So clever. - Just Ieave me. - You're always right. Pick one. You pick the right one, it proves you were right. It's OK, Sam. I know you'II pick the right one. Go with your instinct. - Bang! - Jesus. You're dead, Sam. Oh, dear. You and how many others? - Don't you ever knock? - Why? Got a bird in here? - Where you going? - Back to the start. - What for? - I've no idea. Forget it. Now, do you want the bad news or the bad news? - O'Brien's missing from hospital. - Shit. If that isn't a sign of guilt, I don't know what is. - What's the other bad news? - Call just came through. IRA. Said the next one's the big one. 2pm on the dot. - Bastards didn't say where, though. - That's four hours from now. The IRA don't give that much notice. There's been no code words. Something about this doesn't feel right, Guv. A bit Iike it didn't feel right when the hoax bomb nearly killed Ray? We find O'Brien, we find the bomb. Shall we? - This is going to make things worse. - Not if we find him. Everyone's in a panic. Everyone's scared 'cause they're dealing with the unknown. Scared? Not my Iot, Tyler. Least of all the man in the back here. Eh, Ray? Ray? - Sorry? - You up for it? - Too right, Guv. - See? Bollocks of steel. (DOCTOR ON RADlO) What do you think, Sam? What do we do? Did...? - What do we do? - Take it easy, mate. Just, er... Why don't you give me the gun? What? The gun. We've got to go in hard and fast. When we're inside, we split into two teams. DC Skelton, you're with Cartwright. Ray, you stick with DI Tyler. - OK, good Iuck, Iet's go. - AII set? Let's go. Ray. Just do as I say, right? We don't want any mistakes. - Someone could get hurt. - Yeah, they could, couldn't they? (MUFFLED CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) Enough of the blarney! We're pulling you all in for questioning! Come on, Iads, take them away. Where's O'Brien? Come on, one of you must know where he is. (MAN) BIoody filth! (SHOUTING) (GENE) Come on, Chris! Go and get him. - PIease, follow me. - This way. Ray. (OFFICER) Get 'em out! Get 'em in the back! I'II cut him off. (CRIES OUT) Ray! It's not O'Brien! It's not O'Brien. I don't think he's armed. - Got him in my eyeline, boss. - Do you read me? - What do we do? - Wait! - No! - (CRIES OUT) Shit. 8-7-0. We need an ambulance to the Irish Centre now. I tried to warn you. I said he wasn't armed. You said you thought he wasn't armed. I said wait. - What the hell happened? - I had to shoot, Guv. I told you to wait. What else was I supposed to do? At Ieast I did something. Well, maybe you didn't hear me? BIoody hell, it's Iike the blind Ieading the deaf. Who do I believe? Believe who you want, Guv. Trust who you want. Like I trusted DI Tyler before I got caught in the explosion. Right, we've got just over an hour. We search every house in the area. Only that Iowlife O'Brien knows where the bomb's going to go off. Where are you going, Tyler? No idea. You are not walking away from this investigation. We need to get him now or people are going to die. I'm not walking away, I'm... I just...I just need time to think. You haven't got time to piss about thinking. Come on, you Iot. (DOOR CLOSES) I'm, er... I'm not really what you'd call a religious man, Father. I don't go to church, don't pray. I can't stand CIiff Richard. This isn't even a confession. This is just... It's just...right now I'm Iost. There's nobody else I can talk to. Thing is, Father, I shouldn't even be here. For now, anyway. (SIGHS) An innocent man was shot today. My instincts told me that he wasn't armed but I went against them again. And now I'm sure I'm right about somebody else who's been accused of something I don't think they've done. Trouble is, I'm the only one who believes he's probably innocent. I can't prove it. So what do I do? Go with what I know, the facts? Or take a chance and trust my instincts? (IRISH MAN) If it's any help... ..my instincts have never been wrong. I knew you were a complete nut job the first time that I saw you. But at Ieast you're a nut job who might be on my side for a change. I knew you didn't take those explosives. What makes you so sure I didn't? Apart from your instincts? It just doesn't add up. The IRA don't give the police a few hours' notice to find a bomb. There were no code words used. The Iock-up at the yard, anyone could have broken into that. Yet somehow you became the prime suspect. Maybe somebody wanted us to think that. Like who? No idea. If I can answer that, maybe I can prove you had nothing to do with it. Tyler. Did you really think you were talking to a priest before? Sorry. Smell of the whisky gave it away. You haven't met our priest. Look, how can I trust you that you won't tell Hunt where I am? 'Cause I'm all you've got. And right now you're all I've got. But, just in case... No offence, Father. Right, we widen the search. AII units stick together on this. We've got 40 minutes to find the bomb. I want that bastard found. He's the key. Annie? I'm following up another Iead. - What Iead? - Miller's yard. It's more of a hunch, really. Will you come with me, please? I need someone to help me. Annie, you're coming with us. - Are you coming or what? - Yeah. See you. Mr Miller? Frank? Jesus. I thought you were Miller. - Thought you'd be here. - Great minds. The Guv told me to find you. You'd better get back. Or else what? He said something about tearing out your scrotum and shoving it down your big smug gob, but don't Iet that sway you. OK, Annie. Listen to what I've got to say. And if you don't believe me, I'II come with you. Now, just give me a minute and I will explain. Thirty seconds. Frank Miller's up to his eyeballs in debt. You wouldn't think it with the car that he drives, suits that he wears. Kids, they're all in fee-paying schools. What's Miller being in debt prove, though? Look. I found this. We were right. O'Brien did work at that school where the first bomb went off, but so did Frank Miller. Look. He's marked it on the map. He kept it Iocked in a drawer where he thought nobody would find it. Come on, Iet's see what else we can find before the Guv calls us. These two are on O'Brien's Iist. The bomb outside the school, the one outside the pub. CIay Street, also on there. So why is Kennel Road marked? That's not down here. He's doing something there. From these building plans. Underground tunnels on Kennel Road. Maybe Miller planted that Iist in O'Brien's Iocker. Maybe he wants us to think that CIay Street is the next target, when actually it's Kennel Road. What's worth bombing in these places? A few offices on CIay Street, er... a few shops on Kennel Road... Wimpey bar...a bank. He knows these tunnels. Every access point, because he helped build them. He needs dynamite to blow the bank vault. Who'II suspect him? He does it for a Iiving. He must have been planning this ever since the IRA bomb in London. Bit sick, in't he? PIanting a bomb near a school. He needed to know we'd take his threats seriously. I know what I'd Iike to seriously do the bastard. Call in. Same Irish accent. - IRA, says it's gonna go off in... - CIay Street. - You psychic, boss? - Let's go. No, wait. Guv, Guv. The Irish bloke is Miller. He wants us to think the bomb's going to go off in CIay Street. Think about it. It's perfect timing. It's due to go off in the middle of Iunch hour. Miller thinks half of Manchester's coppers will be in CIay Street, waiting for an explosion that won't happen. While Miller's right over the other side of the city. It takes about 20 minutes to get from CIay Street to Kennel Road. That gives him time to get in, get out, Ieave no clues. - There's no CCTV to track him, so... - CC what? I..it's a security system we used in Hyde. Anyway, the point is, he Iets the IRA take the blame. He's right. O'Brien's the perfect scapegoat for Frank Miller. How do you know? Look, Iook, you know when I said I wasn't wrong? Well, I was. But I was right about this not being the IRA. I was right to follow my instincts. Like you said, go with your gut feeling. I'm just taking your Iead. So I'm right. We both are. - Right. - Right. Just as Iong as I'm more right than you. OK, Iet's get to the bank on Kennel Road. Phyllis, get a unit to CIay Street, get the area cleared just in case. (TYRES SQUEAL) In there. Here. He's broken the Iock. We'd better get to him before he presses that button. I'II wait out here if you Iike, keep an eye out. Get in there. (CHRIS) How far down does this go? (GENE) Shut it, you nelly. Come on, then, Marco Polo. Which way? It's this way. (GENE) We've got about five minutes. Here we go. What are you doing, you dipstick? There's dynamite and you're Iighting a ciggie! Sorry, Guv. According to this, it should be about 50 yards that way. It should just be up here. Ooh. Bingo. OK. Aha. I'II Iead. (CLATTERING, METAL CLANGS) - (GENE) You OK, Ray? - Yeah. Yeah. - (RENE) Where's Ray? - Ray? Don't come any closer. Any of you. - Put the gun down, Miller. - No way. Come on, Miller. This is not the right thing to do. It's too Iate now. Put your guns down or I'II shoot him. He's bluffing. He might be in debt, but he's not a killer. I'II do it! Go on, then. Come on, Miller. Give us your Irish accent. - You gone shy on us? - I'm warning you. Come on, Iet's have it. Five. Four. - Three... - Guv. - Two... - Guv, please. One. Don't, please, Mr Miller. What would your daughter say? You shouldn't be in this Iine of work, Iove. - It's too dangerous for a Iass. - (LIGHTLY) You sound Iike me dad. Just think how proud you were on graduation. That's why you're doing this, isn't it? It's not about the money. It's about your family. She's right, Frank. Guv. PIease. But this is the wrong way to go about it, Frank. If you care that much for your wife and kids, you'd stop this now. You wouldn't want to hurt them by shooting a copper... ..blowing us all up. Is that what they deserve, Frank? - How old's your boy? - He's ten. How's a ten-year-old ever going to understand what you're doing, Frank? He won't. He'II think somehow this was all his fault and that will be in his head forever. Is that what you want for him, Frank? Is that what you want for your family? What do I do, Frank? What do I do? 'Cause my instinct's telling me that someone who Ioves his family that much won't go through with this. And d'you know what? I trust my instinct. Why don't you give me the gun? Come on, Frank. (WHISPERS) Trust me. Just give me the gun. That's it. (GUITAR-BASED ROCK MUSIC) Patrick. I think DCI Hunt has something he'd Iike to say to you. - Have I? - Yeah. Yeah, well, you know, O'Brien, we all make mistakes, eh? - Sorry. - It's a bit Iate for sorry. - Yeah, well, no hard feelings, eh? - No hard feelings? I've been falsely accused, had the crap kicked out of me. - Now I have no job! - Look on the bright side. Still got your health, so, you know, every cloud... A hundred years ago, my grandfather, he worked the bogs in Connemara. He came over here to try and make a better Iife for his family. No one trusted him or wanted his family Iiving next door to them, but it was all right for him to do all the shitty wee jobs the English didn't want to do. That's why I came here. Try and make a better Iife. What, by taking part in a robbery? I'd no job! I'd no money, I was desperate. Like your man Miller. Except I'II never get to run me own business, send me kids to the best schools, drive a fancy motor. Do you know why? 'Cause all our kind are good for is shovelling shit and making bombs. D'you know something, big Iad? I'm sick of shovelling shit. - Right, boys? - You tell them, Patrick. # In Mountjoyjail one Monday morning... Know his trouble? Not so much a chip on his shoulder, more the whole sodding chippy. Yeah, well, I wonder why? Oi, oi, oi! Where you going with that? My new house. On your way. A bit parky to be out in just her nightie. - (MUSIC: "WHEN THE CITY SLEEPS") - I'II take it to the front room. # In the shining sun # My images, they run # Confusing all I've done... - Nice one, boss. - Not bad, Tyler. Well, I did have a bit of help from DC Cartwright. Credit where credit's due. The way you're going, you'II end up Commissioner. Steady on. You'II have her running the flaming country next. Well, maybe we'd be better off if a woman did run the country. She couldn't make a worse job of it than the fellas have. I've got a feeling you might regret saying that one day. There you go. From all of us. Hang on, not quite. (OTHERS EXCLAIM) Cheers, boss. I don't know what to say. Mine's a pint of mild with a whisky chaser. Nelson. A pint for me and the boss, and get one for yourself. Coming up, mon brave. I said, mine's a pint of mild with a whisky chaser. Cartwright's flashing her knickers. Behave. Well done, Sammy boy. 'Course, he Iearnt from the master. No point keeping all that expertise to meself. - Absolutely. - (ALL) Cheers. (GENE) See, the pub, it's the one place the IRA would never touch. - (MUSIC: "HOW CAN I BE SURE?") - Oh, I Iove this one. It's common sense. I've never met an Irishman who didn't Iike a drink, - They won't bomb their own... - (PHONE RINGS) No, you're right, Guv. Did you say bum their own or bomb their own? - Bomb, you donkey. (LAUGHS) - # Whenever l # Whenever I am away from you # I wanna die # 'Cause you know I wanna stay with you... Hello? (MALE DOCTOR) Sam. Sam, despite our fears, you've demonstrated evidence of healthy brain activity, but the mind's a fragile thing, so you must continue to believe and trust in yourself, Sam, Iike we believe and trust in you. We hope you're strong enough to come through this. (DISCONNECTED TONE) Cheers. Cheers. Listen, I forgot to say thanks. I owe you one. - For what? - For helping me. KitKat'II do nicely. Tell you what, seeing as it's you, I'II make it a Chunky one. Chunky? No... # How can I be sure? # I really, really, really wanna know # I really, really, really wanna know # How's the weather? # Weather or not, we're together # Together we'll see it much better # I love you, I love you forever # You know that I can be found # How can I be sure? # (GENE) Five years ago, this was a frightened city. Five women raped and murdered. We know one of the victims knew him, possibly intimately. And we know he's into holding these discreet sex parties. You all put your car keys in a bowl, the wives pull out a key. - I met your daughter, Mrs Williams. - Is she in trouble? We think she might be, yeah. - Denise? - Piss off. (SAM) Don't put yourself at any unnecessary risk, OK? We're here to catch the murderer, not offer him another victim.
