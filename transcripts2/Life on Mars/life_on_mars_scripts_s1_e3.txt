 Oi, keep it on the road! I'll come round your house and stamp on your toys.... Sam? Are you listening, Sam? I know you can hear me. We've been monitoring you closely. Say again, Alpha One? We know you're still in there, Sam. You're right, I'm here, I'm still here. But your levels of responsiveness have decreased recently. You can't give up, Sam. Whatever life-blood is left in your veins, use it.

 You must keep fighting. Keep fighting, Sam. 870, respond? 870! 870, come in, will you! Phyllis, is that you? No, it's Jane Fonda on the hunt for men. I've got a reported stabbing. Stabbing? Where? Crester's Textiles, Queen Mary Road. Uniform's already on the scene. Queen Mary Road? Alpha One, we're all over it. This is a one-way street, so just take a left and... Right nasty one in there, guv. I didn't know folk had that much blood in 'em. I know, it's a shock, isn't it, eh?

 She found him. And it's horrible, Inspector. - I don't believe it. - Sam? I live here... I will live here. - Derek. - It's alright, Tina. Dad, it's Jimmy Saunders. Oh, aye? Are you coming, or what? Garage was over there. There were like, four apartments on this floor. This is all gonna be flats in thirty years. This is just unbe...lievable. Trouble at mill. Loom operator. Jimmy Saunders. Shocking stuff. The only shocking thing is that this didn't happen sooner. Under my kitchen table. He's in my flat. My name is Sam Tyler. I had an accident and I woke up in 1973. Am i mad? In a coma? Or back in time? Whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet. Now maybe if I can work out a reason, I can get home. It's warm, eh? Throws you a bit, dunnit? Hundred years of toil that. The heat just bleeds through the brick. Makes it a living thing. Living things need to keep working on the inside. Once the inside stops... It's just a shell. Anyway. What if you don't catch him? We will. Collected enemies like stamps, did Saunders. Why? If the mill's gonna survive into the next century, it has to modernise. Saunders was the only fella ready to adapt. How do you mean, Mr Coynes? We're planning to pull out the old looms. Upgrade 'em. The new ones do the work of three men. - That means the ones that wanna stay... - Have to prove themselves. The immigrants, well, they're a little brown army. Happy to work triples. But our lads... different story. Too gobby since the unions merged, see. Saunders thought they were holding everyone back. So by working triple shifts, he was defying the union. He could see the way the future lay. What, and someone killed him for that? - So, what happens now? - Well, we close you down, We catch the baddie, open you up again. Sort it quick, won't you? It's supposed to be payday today. They'll go mad. Place is a powder keg as it is. You leave it with me. Take no time at all, sir. Oi, Mary Mary, shift yourself. You're in the way. Let him do his job. It's a right messy one, this. - Chris? - Yeah? I want you to record the shape of this blood on the floor. Blood pattern analysis? By D.H. Cromby. I'll wait for the film, thanks. Oh, you'd like the book. It's got pictures. Right. Wounds are at the front so he was facing his attacker. No bird would be capable of taking on a big fella like this head-on. Killer's male. Great. That really narrows it down. I try and teach him and he just doesn't learn, does he? No, guv. Sorry, boss. No, guv. Cases like this follow a certain pattern, boss. Sure as bacon follows eggs. Limited number of suspects. We know it's a bloke, so it's not a crime of passion. Unless he's a kinky bloke. This is a factory, not a town hall. No, this is a union bloke with an axe to grind. And here's the clincher. Golden rule in these cases is, the first one to speak did it. It was robbery, you know. There's plenty of lowlife out there who knew Saunders had dough. They did it for the cash. Is that right, Mr...? Bannister. Ted Bannister. Let's bring him in and put him in the canteen. Morning, gents. Seen the press? Just thought you'd want to see it. Well, it makes nice headlines, don't it, Litton? Regional Crime Squad actually preventing a robbery rather than shooting everyone dead. Fair's fair, Gene. I just thought your boys could do with a little morale boost, is all, something to aim at. I can see it's a bad time. RCS are holding a celebratory do tomorrow night, if you can make it. Au revoir. Right. We've got a juicy murder and we're gonna nail it today! Chief culprit is Ted Bannister. I want him in custody by teatime. - What, because he spoke first? - Because he's guilty as sin, and he's a Commie bastard. Sorry, it's bollocks. It's total rubbish. You're just itching to get your blood spillage book out, aren't you? You're making him prime suspect, based on what, a hunch? Ray. How many murderers we banged up in the last two years? A dozen. How many times did I know the killer on first sight? - All of them. - Thank you. Except that old dear with the squint. Blimey, that was a turn up, weren't it? No. You what? Sorry, we have to build up a... I'm gonna say this, and I know you're gonna throw things at me, but we need to build up a forensic profile. It's... No way. This won't get solved in the lab. I'm pulling forensics out. Look, think about this logically. Ted Bannister is twice the victim's age and clearly unfit. So you're telling me he could stroll across a deserted factory floor and attack Saunders without Saunders even trying to defend himself. - You think he's innocent? - Yes he is, he's innocent. - Cobblers. - Tenner says he did it. - I'm not playing. - Ten and a Party Seven. If you think I'm gonna reduce a murder enquiry to the level of a playground bet... Cowardy cowardy custard, couldn't cut the mustard. This is just... No fight. No fight? No fight? I want this prepped for mass interviews. Build a profile of the mill community. Who hates who, who sleeps with who, you keep a totally open mind at this juncture. What, a gang of 'em all linked in together? Could be a gang. Could be a gang of trained eagles. Could be ninjas for all we know. No way, boss. Not ninja style. Annie. Blokes at the mill. Cagey lot. We might get somewhere with the women. Try get chatty with'em. All girls together? Play the solidarity card? But don't push it. See what happens. I've squared it with your sergeant. Under you now, am I? Thing is, Tyler, Crime Squad only solve about three crimes a year. We, on the other hand, are always on the go. This is Dodds. - Second rate fence, aren't you, Dodds? - Don't know what you mean. Plod stopped him for running a red light. Found these in his boot. Chalk up another for the boys. Bang him up, Ray. This is all very interesting, but can we stick to the job in hand? Yes! Let's go and make mincemeat of these Bolsheviks. Right, have I done you lot? Names then, one at a flipping time. - Who's grubby paw is this? - Alright, alright! What's your name, love? Think you've underestimated the scale of this investigation. We'll take the bulk of the statements today and I'll brief the department first thing tomorrow morning. Hang on, what do you call "first thing"? I'll also have a resume document ready at the end of each day. You're not giving me stuff to read? Think of it as a back-up in case you lost your sixth sense. You like paperwork, I'll show you paperwork. Who killed him? Come on. Who killed Jimmy Saunders? A fiver to the one who tells me. Come on, who killed him? It was him. Aye, alright then, I did it. And this bugger my accomplice. Thanks for your help. Take these men into custody. You're joking! I never joke about a confession, sir! Now, this is not a game! Jimmy Saunders was brutally hacked to death last night, and the killer might well be standing in this room. In fact, you know you are. Mill's dying. We could all be out anytime. But at least we're sticking together. Triple shifts? Saunders was like management's dancing bear. I don't know nothing. I don't see nothing or hear nothing. He used to call us mugs. Said we couldn't see the future. He didn't give a threepenny bit what hours he did. Ted was right to lay one on him. I wasn't even there. It was Derek. There was a fight in the pub last night. Dad had a set-to with Saunders, so? He were always scrapping. Saunders had to make the eight o'clock shift. He left, me and me dad sunk a few more, then I left about tennish. - Your dad hated him. - Everyone hated him. Dad always said there's two types of enemy. The ones above you, management and government. The one to fear is the other kind: the enemy within your own ranks. Why bother? Textiles is doomed. What's the point of fighting it? Sometimes the fight's the thing. Without it, you go under. You're Father of the Union Chapel. Saunders was a scab. You hated him. I've never denied it. Do you deny having a bellyful of air and then attacking him in a pub last night? I didn't attack him, we came to blows, together. Did you threaten to kill him? "You're dead, pal." My exact words. How many times have you heard people say that? It's been said by men who've toddled off and done just that. Killed someone. - What time'd you leave the pub? - Just before eleven. I went home. Are you a fit man, Ted? I boxed in my prime, but my prime's way back. I hear Saunders used to go running up on the moor. - Do you do much running? - What do you think? - Bloody hell. - Several wounds. One to the left shoulder, one to the chest and two to the right arm. Have you estimated time of death from blood temperature? Sorry. Pathologist's at a wedding. It shouldn't pose a problem. Air temperature's was pretty consistent in there, weren't it? Oh, that's pretty. You should send that to the gallery on VisionArt. They can't promise to return it, but they do give a prize to all those they show. The way this is sprayed suggests an attack carried out at speed. The size of cut suggests a long blade. Like one of them machetes the coloureds use? Ray. Can we please call them the "immigrant workforce"? Who, the coloureds? There's a lot of Sheiks in that mill. Well, they carry ceremonial daggers and all that, don't they? Some bloke could keep it in his locker. Bannister gets his hands on it, Bob's your uncle. Could we put together a forensic profile before you start expanding on this gripping novel any further, guv? - We're gonna carry out a fingertip... - Turn the place over, Ray. Dig holes. I want to see a lot of holes. Talk to the Sheik boys. Anyone lost a dagger? - Find me that blade, Ray. - Consider it done. What about me, guv? Make DI Tyler a potato print. - I'll go then. - Hang on. We'll go through the night shift statements. But they get to look for a big knife! Anyone can run around like an 'eadless chicken, but nothing beats the satisfaction of a thorough investigative process! Alright, come on. Snap out of it! Motivational speaking now, okay? We will get results! Say it. We're winners! Now roar like lions! That was a joke, that, you don't have to do that bit. Bingo. Got one. Martin Ellis, lorry driver. He was waiting for a fabrics pickup at 2.30 this morning. Spotted "a thickset man running out of the loomhall". Chris. Have you ever seen anybody who looks like that? Best we could do. It's a doddle then. We're looking for someone with hamster's cheeks, a nose like Audrey Hepburn and two foot of forehead. These are the body parts they give us. Is there anybody in this station that can draw? What about PC Mallows? Oh yeah, he does cartoons of people at the Christmas party! Okay. Get Mallows and Ellis together. Where are you going? I'm gonna go and check that the guv... isn't planting a dagger in Bannister's locker. Can I ask you something, boss? Why do you do it? Why do you deliberately get his goat? I need to fight, Chris. Annie. I'll just be a minute, girls. He's lost his voice. Got any gum? My mouth tastes like a pub ashtray. Excuse me. Why would anyone turn a factory into a block of flats? It's supposed to look nice. Factories should be factories. Houses should be houses. I mean, things are built for a purpose. It's ridiculous. What would them fellas say if you told them? Look at this! Guv! No! Here he comes, smile. At least keep all the activity to the sides! Trampling over everything like an 'erd of elephants here! Why's it so damp here? What are you doing now? Listening for Indian drums? There, look. Yeah, I can see it. Machine oil. Stops moisture drying on the floor. - This blood's still fresh. - Hey! How did we miss this! It's 'cause you let forensics go too soon. Calico. Soak up the prints. There's loads of it over there. Looks like a size eight, I'd say. What's that marking? Annie, radio the station, tell them to hold anybody not yet processed. We need shoes sizes. Look at you, eh. Proper little CID girl. There's wet patches all over. The killer's obviously tried to cover his tracks, but he's missed a bit. See? Gay-boy science has its place. Here, boss. Check this out. Why are we looking at drawings of... Ted Bannister? ID from the witness. You see? Radar's really wrong. Done and dusted by pub opening. What's going on here? - Hey! What're you doing? - Get off him! What are you doing? Get off me! - Get off him! - Same marking. Right. I'm arresting you for murder, Bannister. Leave him alone, I'm begging you! We're looking for a large blade. Turn the place over. You can't just come in here like... Shut up and we'll start again, shall we? What's going on? That is lovely. Come on! - Keep the kids inside. - Get out! Dad! What's going on, he hasn't done anything! Get off me, you bastard! If he's innocent, there's nothing to worry about, is there? Just a few lazy coppers looking for an easy collar! Easy now, son. Say sorry. Say sorry to the man, Derek. Sorry. Good. Now say "Sorry my dad's scum". Come on, guv. Sorry my dad's scum. "Thanks for getting him off the street." Thanks for getting him off the street. We're dead grateful. I'll get that tenner off you later. It's not over yet. Mad gallop for the finish, is it? You wanna watch yourself, Sammy-boy. I play it rough. I was told to move this on to DI Tyler and unless you want a thick ear... We're in the middle of a murder enquiry... I'm not in mood for this. I've got rotten trapped wind! What's going on? I was told to give you the arresting constable's statements in connection with Eric Dodds. The bloke with the shooters in his boot. Guv thought you might like something else to keep you busy. Is it a problem, boss? Chris. Get a list of Dodds' regular suppliers and accomplices. But we're in the middle of something. I'm gonna say two words to you and they will change your life and put you on the fast track to Inspector. Multi. Tasking. - What you doing? - Get the guv. - Interview conducted... - Is that legal? Trust me, it's better than writing it down. Interview conducted Wednesday 16th of March. Present in the room: Detective Inspector Tyler, Detective Constable Skelton. The time, Chris? - Fourish. - Precise time. Just after four. Five, er... ten past. 4.07. - It's closer to ten past. - Thank you, DC Skelton. Buggeration! One at home always chews up me girlfriend's Elton John. DCI Hunt has just entered the room. DC Skelton concurs. Blood on your boot. The same boot that left a print at the murder scene. I stood in some blood. So what? Look, these things play out the same way so often, it just gets boring. You hated Saunders 'cause he was a scab, you got tanked up, you had a fight and threatened to kill him. You went to the mill and carried out a frenzied attack. Always sounds good in the papers, that, doesn't it. "A frenzied attack". But, on the plus side, I'm up ten quid and a Party Seven. You left the pub just before 11 p.m., then you went home. Can anyone verify that? Ted? It's really stacking up against you, here, mate. You've gotta give me something. The immigrants, they knuckle under. They do the triples. Fair enough, they're grateful. But Saunders, he betrayed us. He broke ranks. The enemy within. The future's desperate for us. The whole community could go down if the mill closes and there's a chance. But I believe if we stick together, we've got a chance an' all. There's hope, that Crester's could go on for another 20, 30, 40 years from now. But we need to fight shoulder to shoulder. - You make it sound like a war. - Yeah, well, maybe it is. - Worth fighting for. - Worth dying for. Worth killing for? How did you kill him, by the way? I told you, I went home. Liar. Liar! I want to see some sort of lawyer. - A liar? - A lawyer! Do you want a glass of water? You know you were eyeballed running away from the mill around the time of the murder? And that's not all. Under the boards in your garden shed. Say goodnight, Gracie and sit down. I said sit down! You've got to open the mill, we can't afford to lose this order. The mill stays shut until our enquiry is over. - For God's sake! - Sit down or I'll sit you down! Now! What? I did it. I killed him. Like he said, I was drunk. - How did it happen? - Went for him. - What with? - A knife! What did you do with it? I threw it in the canal. - But not the bloodied shirt. - That's right. So where should we be trawling, Ted? whereabouts in the canal did you throw it? I told you! I did it! Okay, so you got rid of the knife, but not the bloodied shirt. - That's right. - Now, before you go any further, I want you to think seriously about what you're saying. I want you to think about your family. I am. I'll sign your statement, your confession, whatever it is. Just bring me a pen. Fountain or biro? I tell you what, boss. These tape machines have come in dead handy. Get some cups, Raymondo, and a couple of screwdrivers. Let's get this one cracked. Cheers, guv! Lytts, do me a favour. Run this shirt down to forensics. See if it's a match for the victim's blood. Right, boss. Pity. All those fancy ways, and you still can't admit... Evidence isn't conclusive. The confession isn't sound. He was fuzzy about the details of the killing and about what he did with the murder weapon. And I don't believe his pysch profile would fit that of a killer. So... The bet stands. I know that smell! What the hell are you playing at, Litton? Dodds is ours! Stolen shotguns fall under Crime's jurisprudence. That's a big word, can you spell it? Why didn't you call me? DI Tyler's handling this one personally. Alright then, Inspector. Cat got your tongue? You know the guns are fake, don't you? - Yeah, 'course you do. - Sorry, what? Fake? Yeah. They're wooden guns. Toys. Toys?! I agree that departmental protocol suggests we hand the case over to RCS... in as much as the evidence thus far obtained, however diluted from its original perceived significance, would indeed benefit from... investment by a police body more experienced and equipped to process it through to court. Yeah, I was gonna say that. You could have told me this sooner. Is that Blue Stratos? Paco Rabanne. That was better than the telly. The bet stands, until the bloods are back, on Ted's shirt. And you, Dodds, have got some talking to do. You said they were fakes. Access through the carpark. Bogs are outside. Hey, I've got better things to do, you know. So've I. You'd better not be yanking our chain here, Dodds. The pick-up's in the cafe toilets, yeah? Don't worry, Mr Tyler. It was all arranged. It better have been, or I'll hand you over to DCI Hunt, who will put you on remand for the first unsolved crime he has on his books. Which in this case, happens to be multiple buggery, with menaces. Now, you don't know who the guns are for? I swear I don't. All I do is drop-off. They're blag-slags. No previous form. Okay. You drop the bag, pick up the money. We'll move in when they pick up. I'll tag you. Give me a police radio. Come on! Police! Is my name Coco? What? Why are you trying to make me look like a clown? Litton's gonna have a field day when he finds out you out let four untraceable shooters out there. This isn't about Litton. And don't blame me for this. You dumped it on me. You said you could multi... storey, task, whatever. Can we just focus on what's really important? - Yeah, the bet. - No, Ted Bannister! We're still waiting for the blood match results and time of death. What is your problem, Sam? My problem would rock your world. I'm not giving up on this one. I'm gonna fight it. Ted Bannister is not our killer. I'll show you Ted Bannister. You hungry? Well, I told them not to feed you, you murdering swine. Get in here and say that! Get in here! Come on! You saw him. Is he guilty? He's locked up. He's scared. Snap decision. Guilty. Yes or no? It doesn't work like that. Have you ever been somewhere, and you just know it's about to kick off? That's primeval. When you first saw Bannister... I thought he was hiding something. But I've talked to the man. Your clocks on it was wrong. That's why you're a copper and not a train driver. Sometimes the job is this. And all your fancy science and tape machines... useless without it. - I'm not giving up. - Yeah? Well, if you want to take me on and win, you're going to have to do better than this. 'Cause everything's pointing towards Gene Genie getting his beer. These are all the informal statements from the factory girls. Nice girls actually. Got any Satchawan chicken? I got a meal B. I love making tapes. Lose all Saturday night doing that. Lose a whole statement if you rely on this lot to write it down for you. At least you got a result. No. Your gut feeling tells you otherwise? It's not a gut feeling, Annie. His confession was all wrong. When I mentioned "family", I saw the look of fear in his eyes, and it was real fear. But not for himself. Here you go. Tina Reed. Derek Bannister's girl. She's carrying his baby. She was shaking like a leaf today. Broken nails... she was definitely scared. What if... Ted is confessing... to protect somebody? And what if Tina is scared... because she's covering up for somebody? Who have they both got in common? You're gonna nick Derek Bannister? No, I'm not gonna nick him. I'm gonna bring him in. If Ted is covering for Derek, I reckon I can force the truth out of both of them. Little psychology, Annie. Right up your street. Go to Tina's house. Bring her in. Don't tell her why. Paul, Sarah. Come on, we'll finish this later. - I need your help. - I don't see why. You've got me dad in prison and me mum upset. You're doing fine on your own. Your dad's still at the station. He's terrified the mill's never gonna open. If Crester's goes to the wall, that'll be 800 blokes chasing 20 jobs. I just want the truth to come out, Derek. The truth is, my dad believes if we stick together like... some cotton army, then the factory'll be saved. You seem smart, Derek. Yeah? Three O Levels. Makes me a genius. I'm smart enough to know when my kiddy comes along, there's no one on this earth I'd trust to put food in his mouth but me. He'll have a future. And he won't be kidding himself like me dad. - And he won't be afraid. - What, like you're afraid? What's he doing here? - Go home, son. - Why are you doing this to us, Dad? - Take him home! - Everyone knows you didn't do it! - Yeah, well, I did. - You know that's rubbish, Dad, - they'll throw away the key! - Why'd you bring him here? Come on, Derek, talk to your dad. Get if off your chest. - What's happening at Crester's? - The coppers won't open it. But you've gotta do, you've got your man! - Have we? Have we, Derek? - What about the wages? That's a week's wages for the whole of the factory! No one can get at 'em. Dad, tell me what to do! There's nothing you can do. There's something you can both do. Tell the truth. Dad? - I killed him. - No! Yes! I had no choice! Oh, God. You know why you're here, Tina. Look, if I'd'a known what I know now, it'd be different, I swear. I've got a baby to think of, haven't I? And you can't blame us, because we had no choice. It's not even happening now. It's not. - Can I smoke? - Yes, you can smoke. - Just tell me... - Forensics! Love it! Always loved it! He's here as well now, look, I was told nothing... We're in the middle of something here, guv. The blood match from Ted's shirt. It's Saunders'. Every little drop. You're joking. ...the back, to pick up the bag, I've always been thin like Twiggy, well, not exactly as thin as Twiggy... No one can touch the Gene Genie. That's all I know, that's where it ends, end of story. Get her out of here, Cartwright, she's using up my oxygen. - Tina, love... - End of story. Yeah. End of story. I'm taking you home. What, that's it? I can go? He said you can go. - I'm not in trouble? - No, you're not in trouble. You got some lonely shape, my brudder. Why so? It's over, Nelson. I'm fighting to stay strong, but I feel like I'm losing. You're strong. No doubt. But you got to pick your fights, mon brave. Who you fighting? Mr Hunt? He really your enemy? I don't know. You're fighting cos you're scared. Maybe fear is enemy. It's not over for you, Sam. - What do you want? - I told you. I'm your only friend. I'm here to help. Do you feel helpless? - Yeah. - Unappreciated? - That's a big word for a little girl. - Scared? Scared... I'll stop fighting. If I stop fighting, then I'm scared I'll die. You poor thing. - What can I do? - Give up. Lie down. Close your eyes. And sleep. And sleep. No more nastiness. Just sleep. Just sleep. Forever. Sleep. No! Time of death. Tea, one sugar. Bourbons. See? Multitasking. - Hand it over. - Here you go. The report, Chris. Shit! Ted Bannister left the pub at ten to eleven. Derek left at ten. Saunders was murdered before nine. Which means... both Ted and Derek were still in the pub drinking when it happened. Who the hell killed him, then? Look, we know you didn't do it! I've told you, you've got it wrong, I've signed a confession! Well, we're all at sea here, because this is making zero sense! Now, you'd better start helping us out! Start talking, cos I'm thirsty. Yeah, well, I've told you! I did it! What are we looking for? The bloods on that shirt carried oil traces. Well, it's a work shirt. You didn't read the forensic report, you, did you? There was oil in Saunders' wounds. There's oil everywhere, it's a factory. Hang on, this is the loom he was using when he died. - No, this oil is a red herring. - Hang on, I've got a feeling. Oh, so it's alright for you to have feelings, is it, Gladys? - What's wrong with this machine? - I dunno. It's the wrong colour. It's giving you a shifty look. Mr Coynes...there's no dirt, or oil, on this belt. It's a brand new belt. It's not dirty because it hasn't been used as yet. But it was being used. By Saunders, the night he died. So, that means somebody has replaced the belt, after his death. - Bloody hell. - Yeah, well, you lost me. Why would somebody replace this belt? They can snap. And what happens when they snap? Jimmy Saunders wasn't murdered. This belt drives the drums behind me. Two inch wide leather, at tension, running at high speed, and bound with staples. Now, these belts, they can wear down. Shear. The belt snapped Flew out the loom, like a whip, straight at Saunders. Chris, can you step up please? Now, he saw it coming. Nothing he could do about it. The wounds... ...were here, here and here. Four separate wounds, right? Chris, put your arms up, try to defend yourself. Without the Boris Karloffs. See, if you line the wounds up, they form a single straight line, right across the body, and around the shoulder. Hang about, Sherlock. We've got an ID of Ted leaving the scene. So you went to the factory to have it out with him. To finish what you'd started. He was dead. - I panicked. - You tried to clean up. You replaced the drive belt with a new one from stores. Why do that? If it got out, it'd be a death knell for the factory. Dodgy floor joist can close a mill. What's a fatal accident going to do to us? It took you a long time to clear up, though, didn't it? Half two by the time you left. You were spotted by Martin Ellis, truck driver. You'd do that, just so they could keep their jobs. Just for the chance they could keep their jobs. Sorry. Why? Right, get out of my station, get out of my sight. I should bang you up for just wasting my time. It doesn't matter. Only my family matters. It's good though. Nobody goes down for life. Community goes down for life. You don't know that for sure. We were going for that drink. Sorry. Got to finish the report. But that's when they asked us to do it. That's where it ends, that's all I know, end of story. Ray. I was told nothing. Go through the back, pick up the bag. I've always been thin like Twiggy, well, not exactly as thin as Twiggy... She didn't half go on, that one. Hang on a minute. I was told nothing. Go through the back, pick up the bag. I've always been thin... "Go through the back and pick up the bag". Meaning? Outside toilet. I picked up the guns. But Derek wasn't gonna use 'em. Not even with no one at the mill. Ted says you've gotta fight. Does he know? Ted? 'Course not. It's a wages job. Alright, love. We're picking up your boyfriend, and I need the addresses of the other blokes involved. They're not there. The factory's gonna open tomorrow, innit? They're doing the job tonight. Right. Dirty Harry. We should call Litton and the RCS. Okay. Then we can call the Mayor and he can give 'em another award. Look, I haven't done target range for a while. It's okay. Blokes are a lot easier to hit than paper targets. You want it or not? Probably end up turning it on us. Yeah, but can you hit anything? You should see my Playstation scores. Drop your weapons! You are surrounded by armed bastards! Up yours! Put it down! Police! Stay where you are, where I can see you! Drop it, laughing boy! Get away! - Drop it. - Shoot! You know you want to, so drop it. I'm on him! Derek. Think about it. - Put the gun on the floor. - I can't do that. Yes you can. You've got a baby on the way, mate. That's why I'm doing it. I'm the only one who can, you know that. It's a war. Now, drop the gun. Put it down. Last warning. You can't hit me 'fore I hit him. For God's sake, don't throw him down a wager. Your turn. "I'm sorry I'm scum." Say it. Sorry, son. - Doesn't work that way. - Say it! Come on, Derek. Is this really the best life plan you could come up with? - Stealing from your own? - Or what? Meant to stand shoulder to shoulder with them? Your dad was willing to give up everything to stop this place from closing. He didn't want to kill anybody. He wanted to save everyone. Look, I know how you're feeling. You feel like the walls are closing in on you and you're trapped and terrified of what's waiting for you out there. You see, Derek? You think you got problems, I have to work with him! - Shut up! - Derek. It's not fair! Now listen to me. You're looking at... first offence - five years. Now... I'm gonna pick up my gun, and I want you to put yours down. - Uh, Sam, no. Alright, Derek? Chris, Ray, ambulance, now, quick! You okay? See, I told you. I'll do you a deal. I'll listen to your little tape machine, now and again, okay, so long as you, just sometimes, listen to this. 'kay? He was quite badly injured. And, Ted... he's under arrest. You alright, son? Dad. I was scared. I couldn't see a future for us. But you could've come to me. It was down to me. I had to fight. Oh, you stupid boy. I mean, you've got your workmates, your mam and dad, your family. You're not on your own. Nobody is. Not unless you want to be. He's right, what he said. It is a war. At least I know what I'm fighting for. You want a drink, Litton? 'Fraid we haven't got any Babycham. You knew those shooters were the real deal. Bloody hell, you really are a detective. That's very good. Now, when are you gonna get it into your thick skulls that armed blags are mine? Do you mind? I nearly had my brains blown out tonight! Would you have noticed? If you were going for heavy blood loss, Gene, should have shot you in the gut. Hey. Mr Litton, I think you'd better swallow it down. We had a result. One nil. Right, the chosen vintage of the CID. What are you thinking, dare she ask? I've been thinking... about what's important. Oi, Romeo. We gonna open this bogwater or what? You open it. No, I can't. It needs two. - Eh up, here we go. - Go on then. Subtitles: Nathbot www.seriessub.com
