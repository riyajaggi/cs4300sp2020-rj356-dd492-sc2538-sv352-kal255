Adelita's been delivered safe and sound. She's now resting comfortably at the 32nd street naval station. - Medical workup? - Both mother and child are fine. - Oh, that's something, isn't it? And, uh, what magic... Have our friends in la policía estatal conjured up? - Nothing. They couldn't get anything off the car. It was burned to the bone. - Course it was. - Someone intercepted that car, figured out adelita was behind door number three. - Policía said that when they got to the scene, adelita was just... Standing there. The other car was too far to pursue. Must have been someone who was spooked by the sirens. A local crew, a random carjack? - Are 1989 crown vic wagons topping the most stolen vehicle chart these days?
