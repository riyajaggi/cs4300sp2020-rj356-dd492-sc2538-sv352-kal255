 Previously on "Mayans M.C."... The irish have nowhere to bring their guns. I'm sorry to be droppin' all this shit in your laps right now but... you wanna bring them south. Aye. We have contacts in tijuana. The vatos malditos. Bad blood with you and the shot caller? - Palo. - Something like that. I think it's in our best interest to avoid retaliation. If riz had died,

 if what happened to you was permanent, I wouldn't hesitate to strike back. Forgive me. - Riz didn't make it. - We're going to war. Why is potter texting you? He's threatening to deport my dad.

 they match entries I found in a household ledger. Same dates, same amounts. - Dita galindo. - It's miguel's mom. - It wasn't miguel. - Dita ordered the hit. I'm so sorry. - Good morning. - Morning. Pop. Thanks. You sleep at all? What do you think? Yeah. You were right, angel. This obsession buried me nine years ago. It's doing it again. I should have let it go. What happened nine years ago should have never landed on you alone. I should have been there with you, ez. That night... I'm fucking sorry, bro. I should have believed you. Fucking helped you. No. Your mother's dead... Because of what I did. My sin. It doesn't matter anymore, pop. Yes, it does. I'm gonna talk to dita today... Get the truth. Why don't you take that? It's been ringing all morning. Hey. We lost riz last night. Shit. We figure this shit out together. Understand? - Yeah. - Don't do anything without us. ♪ Mother of exiles ♪ ♪ the torch of hope ♪ ♪ in the toss of the tempest ♪ ♪ threw us madison's rope ♪ ♪ but the brazen giant ♪ ♪ with limbs astride ♪ ♪ blocks the golden door ♪ ♪ to the u.S.

Thank you so much. Oh, my god. - Yeah. - Okay. When? Hey, everything cool? Yeah. Stayed at my pop's last night. How's she holding up? Rough. Riz was her only family this side of the border. Uh, just talked to the hospital. They have to hold on to the body for a few days. Autopsy. Insurance stuff. Rough morning. Yep. Take your time here. We'll wait for you at the clubhouse. - Wait for me? - Why? Riz is dead. You know how this shit is going down. The vatos pay. Shit is blowing up, bish. Other charters caught wind of your call. - It's not good. - I don't give a fuck. This is san pa's business. We handle shit our way. Bish, we just wanna talk to bishop the king. Make sure he knows the ramifications of what bishop the president is about to do. You all right, prez? Yeah. Why are the kings still here? Paperwork. You ready for the vote tomorrow night? I'm ready. For the groundbreaking? - Yeah. - Just some notes. I'm gonna go to city planning, talk to ileana. See what people actually say at these ceremonies. How is ileana? Losing her... her house, her staff. So much trauma and suffering. She could probably use a fresh start. No, she's fine. I guess you were right. It all worked out for the best. Your mom has dr. Luna today, so I'll have paco drop her off, wait until she's done. - Great. - Thank you. I know what's at stake. But you can't force my hand on this. You're right, carnal. But you need to know what's going down. Portland and spokane have been waiting two years for the gun business. They set up buyers from vancouver to montana. If we blow this vm deal, they're ready to defect. - What? - Split off. Wear a fringe patch, take the gun business themselves. They're already talking to chibs. And you know what happens to an m.C. If that shit goes down. Rocks the faith, brother. Inside and out. We lose the unity. We lose everything. Fuck. Just talk to palo, one-on-one. Hear what he has to say. He knows he fucked up. Good. Thank you. Where? Between tj and tecate. Palo's abuelita's. He's there for a few days. Guess it's her birthday. I'll take hank. Don't say anything to my guys. Not until I know what this looks like. Of course. We'll be at vicky's. Let us know when you're back. That ain't good. Trying to get bishop to change his mind. Recant the payback. It's fucked, bro. Dondo said portland's threatening to split. You serious? What does that mean? It doesn't fucking matter. Dude, portland's the second biggest charter. They wanna bail, let them. We're the ones living in the fucking jungle, man. Risking our asses every day. Those coconut-ass norteños want shit handed to them? - Fuck that. - All right, we get it. You don't get shit... this just can't be about the money. I had that life, and I ain't gonna live it again. This shit happened for a reason. The next right thing is an eye for an eye. Think about that, boy scout, think about what this means and why you want it. And if the reason ain't something that you can feel in here, then do yourself a favor. Move the fuck on. Get the fuck out of my way! - I'm so sorry. - You okay, chucky? Oh, I should have been more alert. Always in the way. Don't be in the way! Be the ball, chucky. Stay out of the lane, stay in your lane. Hey, brother. I'm sorry. Come on. It's crazy. Crazy couple of days. Crazy's the easy part. It's what happens after crazy that fucks you up. - Hey. - You moving offices? I took another job. What? In san diego. To be closer to my sister. As a city planner? Housing authority. That's not what you do. Ileana. Did someone force you to take this? - It was the right move, emily. - No, no, no. You don't have to do this. I... - it's too late. - It's done. You and your husband got what you wanted. What? - What did miguel do? - Really? Jesus christ, just leave me and my family alone. - Hey. - Thank you for coming. Everything okay last night? Dropping you off? Yeah, it was fine. Is felipe doing all right? Um, I don't know. The information on potter. She was a witness potter was involved with. They had a kid. I wrote it down, everything miguel told me, and it is enough to knock potter a few rungs down the ladder, and at the very least, declaw him. Jesus. Ez, promise me nothing happens to miguel. I... I promise. If we use it, nothing happens to miguel. Thank you. Where'd galindo get this shit? Palomo. To use against potter to get adelita back. Why'd emily give it to you? I got one of potter's texts last night. Emily saw my reaction. I told her potter was blackmailing us. Using pops as leverage. She gave me this and said I could use it to free pop if I promised not to hurt miguel. We use it to free pop, galindo won't be able to use it for adelita. - It's your call, angel. - Fuck no. Yes, it is. I know how you feel about adelita, how much you're gonna love that kid. Just say the word, hermano, and I'll shred all of this. We'll let galindo play it out, use it to get adelita back. But I had to bring this to you, give you the choice. No more secrets. I'm gonna go check on pop. Let me know what you wanna do. Call potter. Set a meeting. Yeah? Okay. I trust all went well with lioness and cub. No complications. Hmm. The circle of life continues. - Have we drawn blood? - Yes. If there's a match, we should know - by end of day tomorrow. - Good. Then we move luisa espina into the interrogation wing. Hola, amor. Marisol. Did you have her killed? Did you hire someone to kill both of us? Miguel had just made his first development deal. Jose and I came out to celebrate. We went to the local festival. You saw marisol and me. Dita, why? Almost 20 years had passed. It was mostly about miguel. I couldn't lose him, too. And now he was in your backyard. I knew you suspected he was your son. I was afraid you would try to connect with him, but when I saw you with isabel, even after all those years, I hated it. I could see how much you loved her. Jesus christ. - There was nothing to share. - Nothing. That part of my life was over. It's time for me to go, felipe. Not by an act of nature. That failed. It has to be you. Ride okay? Yeah. Turns 90 tomorrow and still works like she's 25. Talk inside? Yeah. Sure you wanna do this? We don't have to do this if... yeah, we do. Haven't told me why. After that day in the desert, when adelita sent me away... sent us all away... I don't know, man, it fuckin'... Split me in half, you know? Like something changed. I finally saw who she was. A little bit of who I could be. So now any time I feel lost... Fucked up, sad and shit, I ask myself what she would do... And what she would say. She'd tell you to help pop. Yeah, and she'd be fucking proud of me. And then there's also the real possibility that if we use that shit to free her, she would fucking send us home again. I'm proud of you, angel. - Tch. - Shut up. Can't we just shoot this guy in the fucking face? That's plan b. The gentlemen bikers. Fate continues to steer, and all roads lead back to us. I trust the contents will be worth my commute. Yeah. Everything about your favorite latina and all the dirty little secrets. Remember her? What is this? It's fate, motherfucker. We know she was a witness for prosecution. Capital murder case that you won. We also know you were sleeping with her. Then this shit happened. We send this to your superiors in the doj, I'm pretty sure knocking someone up is considered manipulating a witness. Your career is fucked. Or maybe we just visit mama. She's pretty hot. I'm sure it'd be worth the commute. Hey... sir! Back... The fuck up. Back up. Sir, is everything all right? Just a momentary flash of passion, agent smithers, stand... stand down. Everything's fine. I'm waiting. You're gonna drive back to your fifth ring of hell and you're gonna throw out anything you have on ignacio cortina. He didn't exist. You understand? Then you're gonna enter felipe and marisol reyes into the cis database and make them us citizens. You got 24 hours. Even I can't restructure the immigration process... if there is not a letter from immigration services on my old man's doorstep by tomorrow night, this shit lands on the d.A.G.'s desk. And you can hang on to those. We have the originals. You've fucked with me and my family enough. It's over. Thank you, grandmother. Happy birthday. Bring the offer to the kings. Figure out how to compensate my guys. It's the best thing for both clubs. Yeah. I'll reach out to charming. Let chibs know we're moving ahead. So how'd it go? Uh, I played it the way I had to. Yeah. Kings gave you no choice. - You talked to grandma? - Yeah. She's excited about her party tomorrow. Pop? Hey. You okay? - Yeah. - Sit down, please. What's going on? I talked to dita. She confessed. Fuck. She knew it'd come down to this. Come down to what? She wants to die, son. Thinks the fire didn't kill her because that's what I'm supposed to do. She's fucking crazy. Probably. You can't do it, pop. I've been trying to hide from ignacio cortina for 30 years. But the things he did, the violence, the betrayal... That's truth that couldn't be ignored. So felipe reyes has to pay the price. Y... you're not making any sense. Go with your brother. Do whatever you need to do. Let me deal with the sins of the past. No. Don't argue with me. I told you, I can take care of this. Now go. - We're not going. - Stop it! Don't disrespect me. My decision. I'll do what I need to do. Now get the fuck out of here. Leave me to it. Both of you. ♪ Your breath is sweet ♪ ♪ your eyes are like two jewels in the sky ♪ everything okay with galindo? I wasn't with galindo. We were on the other side. - I sat down with palo. - I fucking knew it! You caved to the... you interrupt me again, I'm gonna gouge your fucking eyes out myself. ♪ Your loyalty is not to me but ♪ let ramos and canche know we're back. Table. Now. Mamá, permiso? Yes. Thank you. Good night. Te quiero, miguel. Te quiero, mama. It's not how I planned it. But the shot caller crown... It shines a light on the choices I make. So I navigate the best way I can. I know you hate doing it this way. Feels like you're betraying the patch. But we'll figure it out. I promise you that. Ramos and canche are out there, waiting. Please... Play it smart. Don't blow shit up. You motherfuckers got what you wanted? We take the bullet, the rest of the m.C. Take the prizes? Fuck you! Fuck you, huh? Betrayal! Fuck you! Coco! - Fuck you, homie! - Straight up fuck you! Stay in your lane, stay in your lane. Hey. Hey, chucky, wait. Hey... Hey, I'm sorry about what happened. - No, that's okay. - No, it wasn't. I fucking love you, chucky. We all do. You made the right call, carnal. Yeah, I did. Your crew will come around. Safe trip. Yeah, thanks, brother. You sure about this, jefe? Nope. Si, senora. you gotta be fucking kidding me. That's how we feel about the santo padre agra park. It's not just about revitalizing the valley's agriculture. It is about reinvigorating hope. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you, mayor. Thank you. Hey. - You talk to pop? - I called. No answer. - Let's head to the shop. - Yeah. Hey-o. From a lovely woman. Older, soft-spoken, very nice hair. Thanks, chucky. Hmm? Oh, yes. Si. Uh... uh, yes. Thank you. Yes? I got dna results back from cali corrections. Mm-hmm. There was a match. I double checked. It's his kid. She's awake if you wanna talk to her. No, that... that won't be necessary. After the meal is over... Take the baby. What are we doing here? I know this is difficult for you but it's the right thing. No, it's not. Psychotic. I'm not gonna kill you, dita. - I can't. - I know. I realized that yesterday. - What are they doing here? - I asked them to come. The fuck did you do? Nothing's gonna happen here. Go back to your bikes. Ez. The fuck do you want from us? Karma. One of you reyes men has to help me right a wrong today. A mother for a mother. Jesus. I left notes for the people I love. They'll think it's a suicide. No blame will fall on anyone. - I'll do it. - No. - She's got a can full of gas. - She wants to burn. - I'll do it. - Ignacio could. Felipe cannot. - It's okay, mi amor. - He's not your love. I was the one that pulled this thread. I have to end this. Ez, this is not you. Yeah, pop. It is. Take him to the truck. Come on, pop. I'm deeply sorry... this isn't about you or your fucking karma. You destroyed my family. Amen. Look at me. Look at me. He's definitely made things a little more interesting around here. Had a rocky start, but finished strong. That's not a comment on sponsorship. Yeah, it is. Anyone else? Pros or cons? I didn't want this for him. That's why I was a shitty sponsor. Ez was supposed to be the one who got the fuck out. Fuck, man. He had it all. But now... He belongs to us. This family. We need him. I need him. Ezekiel reyes... has he earned the right to carry the macuahuitl and take a seat at la mesa del guerrero? Come on. What happened? Sorry, bro. Take off the kutte. On the table. Congratulations, ezekial. Welcome to the tribe. Sew that on. We got a party to go to. We good? Yeah. This is who we are now, bro. - You understand that? - I do. It's not what I wanted for you.

I was gone, like, 20 seconds. I didn't even know she could drive.
