Didn't mean to interrupt. - Oh, you're not interrupting. I got this from montserrat palomo. Information about potter. - It's a woman? - A woman he loved. And their child. - Are you going to threaten them? - No. No, it turns out this woman was a key witness in a capital murder case. One of potter's first big wins while working with the mexican government. - Sleeping with your witness? - Mm. - They'd throw out the case and overturn the verdict. - That's why he kept it a secret, even after his son was born. - That would fuck with his mexican tenure. - Oh, he'd be done in this part of the world. - Why are you telling me this? - Because. I'd use this leverage to help adelita. And I don't want any more secrets about her or anything else. Look, you were right, em. I lost sight of what's important. You. Cristobal. My life on this side.

Your vote sways the majority. - [exhales] obispo, this is why I split the power of the mayans between three kings. Handed the lead chair to you. It's not the same club I started, primo. It's bigger, sophisticated, much more profitable. The way mayans is growing, in a few years, you'll rival any syndicate in the country. - I guess we're not just motorcycle enthusiasts anymore. - We never were. You up for the challenge? - Yeah. I am. - Good. - You miss it? - Every fucking day. I'm sorry I couldn't make it to medina's funeral. - I know. His widow, she appreciated the gift.

The fires, everything going on with the feds. - I can imagine. Something wrong, el padrino? - You tell me. First, miguel's mother gets lost in downtown, ends up at your father's shop. He drives her home. - Well, I didn't know that. I've never met miguel's mother. Wouldn't know her if I bumped into her on the street. - Right. But then emily shows up at your father's shop and it was closed. - You'd have to ask emily. - Yeah, problem with that, ez, is that for one reason or the other, emily isn't saying much about anything to anyone. Agra park win, her friend at city planning, the day clerk. So many loose ends. It's got miguel worried. - Yeah. We have history. I care about her. If she came to me for help, I'd help her. - So did she? - I'm afraid only she can answer that. [tense music] ♪ ♪ - I like you, son. You have a future here. You're smart, ambitious.
