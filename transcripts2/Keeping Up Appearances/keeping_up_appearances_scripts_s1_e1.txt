 ANYTHING WRONG,  HYACINTH? HE'S MISLAID MY LETTERS AT THE SORTING OFFICE. THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED WITH MY FORMER POSTMAN. YOU WILL REMEMBER,  ELIZABETH, THAT YOU'RE INVITED THIS EVENING TO MY CANDLELIGHT SUPPER? IT'S ENGRAVED ON  MY MIND, HYACINTH. TELEPHONE, DEAR.  YOU'RE WANTED ON  THE PHONE. I THINK IT'S URGENT. I'M NOT OFFERING AN OPINION.  THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID, URGENT. PLEASE DON'T SHOUT  IN THAT EXCITABLE MANNER  OUTDOORS, RICHARD. I DON'T LIKE YOU GETTING EXCITED OUTDOORS. ( dog barks ) MORNING, MAJOR. BY GOD, WOMAN. YOU COULD DRIVE A MAN MAD  LOOKING SO ATTRACTIVE SO EARLY IN THE DAY. OH, MAJOR. YOU'LL NOT FORGET  MY LITTLE CANDLELIGHT  SUPPER THIS EVENING? 19:30 HOURS. I'LL BE THERE, YOU MINX. YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL BREEDING. THE PHONE, HYACINTH. IT THINK IT'S URGENT. IT'S ABOUT YOUR FATHER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EMULSION THIS CEILING. WE'VE JUST DONE IT. IT'S NOT A FIT CEILING  TO BRING A MAJOR UNDER. IT'S YOUR SISTER, DAISY. SHE'S NOT COMING,  IS SHE? NOT IN THAT AWFUL COAT. AND HE'S NOT BRINGING HER.  NOT IN THAT RUST BUCKET  OF A CAR. - I WILL NOT HAVE THEM--  - I THINK IT'S URGENT. IT'S SO THOUGHTLESS  TO LOOK AS POOR  AS THEY DO. DAISY, HOW ARE YOU, DEAR? DADDY ILL?  HOW ILL? IS IT OF A SEVERITY  NECESSARY TO CANCEL  MY CANDLELIGHT SUPPER? WHAT WAS HE DOING AT HIS AGE ON A BICYCLE? OH MY GOD. HOW MUCH TO DRINK? YES, HYACINTH. WHAT DID SHE SAY? SHE SAYS NOT TO GO  OVER TO HER PLACE.  SHE'S COMING HERE. THAT'S ALL WE NEED,  A ROYAL VISIT. I WAS HOPING SHE'D GO  STRAIGHT TO THE HOSPITAL. THEY WON'T LET ANYBODY IN UNTIL VISITING TIME. DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN HAVING THAT BREAKDOWN ON ACCOUNT OF MR. CRABTREE? WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO MR. CRABTREE? I SWORE I'D  NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN. AND FOR A WHILE  I CUT IT BACK RUTHLESSLY  TO EVERY OTHER TUESDAY. DOES BORIS KNOW ABOUT YOU STILL SEEING MR. CRABTREE? OF COURSE HE DOESN'T.  DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID? I DON'T KNOW  HOW YOU KEEP  THE PACE UP, ROSE. IT'S NOT EASY. IF YOU RELAX FOR A MINUTE  THEY'RE GOING BACK  TO THEIR WIVES. I ENVY YOU, DAISY. ME? IT MUST BE WONDERFUL BEING MARRIED TO A BUM LIKE YOUR ONSLOW. SO YOU CAN LET YOURSELF GO COMPLETELY. I WOULDN'T SAY COMPLETELY. NEAR ENOUGH,  COMPLETELY. GET A SHIRT ON, ONSLOW.  HYACINTH'S COMING. HOW NICE. SHE'S GOING TO WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL HER. I DON'T SEE WHY  I SHOULD HAVE  TO TELL HER. YOU'LL HAVE  TO TELL HER BECAUSE... I'LL BE TOO BUSY  TIDYING UP. I HATE TIDYING UP. I'M UNDER THE DOCTOR FOR BEING DIZZY. I'M SURE IT'S TIDYING UP. IF YOU ONLY GOT DIZZY  WHEN YOU TIDIED UP YOU SHOULD HAVE THE CLEAREST HEAD  IN THE AREA. YOU'RE GOING TO PARK IN THE TURNING AREA? THERE'S NO ROOM IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE, IT BLOCKS THE ROAD. HOWEVER, I'M GAME IF YOU ARE, IF YOU WANT TO BLOCK THE ROAD. IT'S JUST THAT I WISH  YOU WOULD CONSULT ME. I DON'T LIKE YOU MAKING  DECISIONS UNILATERALLY. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO LOCK THE CAR? I THINK SO.  DON'T YOU? WE'RE PRACTICALLY  IN BEIRUT. ONSLOW. ( whistling ) DICKY.  HYACINTH. WHY DO YOU LET HIM CALL YOU "DICKY"? HOW CAN I HELP IT IF HE CALLS ME "DICKY"? ( Onslow whistling ) QUEEN MOTHER'S OUTSIDE. GIVE US A HAND, ROSE. I'M EXPECTING A CALL. I GAVE BORIS THIS NUMBER.  THE SWINE PROMISED HE'D RING. LEAVE--  LEAVE IT. ( car squeaks ) - RICHARD!  - NOW WHAT? YOU SHOULDN'T BE  STRETCHING YOUR LEGS  LIKE THAT AT YOUR AGE. IT'S NOT FITTING  IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, IN FRONT OF PRYING EYES. ( gunfire, yelling on TV ) ( can opens ) Daisy:  HERE WE ARE THEN. THANKS, DAISY. DRINK UP. TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENED. DAD'S NOT BEEN-- WELL LATELY. WHY WASN'T I INFORMED? IT'S NOT BEEN THE KIND OF "NOT WELL" YOU'D WANT TO BE INFORMED ABOUT. WHAT KIND HAS IT BEEN? IT'S A BIT EMBARRASSING. EMBARRASSING?  DADDY? - HE'S A DIRTY OLD MAN.  - SHUT UP, ONSLOW. RICHARD, GO AND KEEP AN EYE ON THE CAR. I THINK I'LL GO  AND KEEP AN EYE  ON THE CAR. WHAT DOES ONSLOW MEAN? HE MEANS... DAD'S TAKEN TO GOING OUT  AT NIGHT ON HIS OWN LATELY. IN THE NAUGHTY.  ( laughs) ( cup clangs ) BUT--  BUT, BUT-- WHY WOULD FATHER BE  IN THE NUDE? HE'S IN LOVE WITH THE MILKWOMAN. DON'T BE SO RIDICULOUS. YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT SO IF YOU'D  SEEN HIM PEDDLING AFTER HER STARK NAKED ON HIS BIKE. HE CHASED HER FOR A MILE,  DOWN BY THE CANAL. BUT THE MILKWOMAN DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR THE CANAL, DOES SHE? SHE DID LAST NIGHT. HE CAUGHT HER ON HER WAY TO BINGO. WELL... YOU KNOW HOW FOND HE IS OF DAIRY PRODUCTS. I EXPECT HE WANTED TO ORDER EXTRA CREAM. WHY WOULD YOUR FATHER HAVE BEEN NAKED? I DON'T BELIEVE IT. AND KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN. IT'S BAD ENOUGH  WITH HIS CLOTHES ON. DADDY WOULD NEVER  BE NAKED. WHY WOULD DADDY BE NAKED  WHEN HE'S GOT HIS NAME DOWN FOR A NICE  OLD PERSON'S BUNGALOW? THIS WAY, MRS. BUCKET. IT'S "BOUQUET." HOW ARE YOU FEELING MR. OXLEY? ( chuckles ) BETTER THAN HIM. DADDY. I'M AFRAID HE WON'T BE AWARE OF VERY MUCH, MRS. BUCKET-- "BOUQUET." HE'S QUITE COMFORTABLE  BUT HEAVILY SEDATED. OH, DADDY. SHOULD HE BE IN A WARD WITH A PERSON WHO WEARS HIS HAT IN BED? I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH YOUR FATHER. DOCTOR... WHAT CONDITION WAS MY FATHER IN WHEN HE WAS ADMITTED? DRUNK AS A SKUNK. I EXPECT HE WAS FLUSHED FROM EXCESSIVE CYCLING. CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT HE WAS WEARING, DOCTOR? VERY QUICKLY. VERY LITTLE, REALLY. TO BE HONEST...  NOTHING AT ALL. THERE MUST BE  SOME MISTAKE. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.  IT WAS QUITE  A CHILLY EVENING. HE'D BEEN IN THE CANAL. HE WAS THAT PLASTERED,  HE WOBBLED OFF INTO THE CANAL. THAT EXPLAINS IT. MY FATHER WAS CYCLING  ALONG THE CANAL WHEN HE SAW  SOMEONE IN DISTRESS, SO HE REMOVED  HIS OUTER GARMENTS AND DIVED IN TO SAVE THEM. OH, BRAVE DADDY. VERY COMMENDABLE. HE MUST'VE REMOVED MORE THAN HIS OUTER GARMENTS, MRS. BUCKET. "BOUQUET." WHEN HE WAS PULLED OUT HE WAS ABSOLUTELY NAKED. POLLUTION. WHAT HE'D BEEN WEARING WAS  OBVIOUSLY DISSOLVED BY THE POLLUTION. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I MUST ATTEND TO MY OTHER PATIENTS. WHY IS HE SEDATED  AFTER SUCH A PLUCKY ACT? HE WAS HIGHLY EXCITED, AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE INJURY. FROM THE MILK BOTTLE? POOR LAMB. WHERE IS THE INJURY?  YOU MAY TELL ME THE WORST. - UH, MRS.--  - I DEMAND TO BE SHOWN THE EXTENT  OF HIS INJURIES. VERY WELL. WHERE IS THE INJURY? NEVER YOU MIND. HOW ARE THINGS? I'M TOO DISTRESSED AT THE MOMENT, ELIZABETH. MY FATHER IS RECOVERING FROM INJURIES SUSTAINED IN THE COURSE OF A VERY PLUCKY ACTION... WHICH HE MODESTLY FORBIDS ME TO DISCUSS. OH, WELL, IS THERE  ANYTHING I-- JUST GIVE ME TIME TO RECOVER MY COMPOSURE, AND THEN COME AND TAKE TEA WITH ME AT 3:25. 3:25?  NOT 27? ( doorbell rings ) OH, IT'S YOU, ELIZABETH! A TINY BIT EARLY, PERHAPS, BUT DO COME IN. I THOUGHT IT WAS 3:25. - NOT QUITE, DEAR.  - MY WATCH SAYS 3:25. OH, THAT WATCH, YES.  I EXPECT IT WOULD. SHALL WE GO THROUGH  TO THE KITCHEN? I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WON'T LET ME THROUGH YOUR BACK DOOR. I THINK IT'S SO COMMON, DON'T YOU, USING BACK DOORS? NO, THE PROPER WAY  FOR MY GUESTS,  I ALWAYS FEEL, IS THROUGH  THE FRONT DOOR. AND THEN STRAIGHT INTO THE KITCHEN? WELL, YES. UNLESS, OF COURSE,  IT'S SOMEONE SPECIAL. NOW I KNOW YOU'RE SAYING  TO YOURSELF, "HOW IS SHE BEING SO BRAVE?" WELL, YES, I AM BRAVE. MY FATHER WOULD WISH IT. I ADMIT I MISS MY SHERIDAN  AT TIMES LIKE THESE. HE'S SUCH A COMFORT TO HIS  MOTHER AS WELL AS BEING TERRIBLY GIFTED. DO SIT DOWN, ELIZABETH.  MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME. OH, NOT THERE, DEAR.  I LIKE TO FACE THE WINDOW. LEMON? W-- MY WORD, DOESN'T SOMEONE LOOK SMARTER THAN SHE DID EARLIER? SOMETHING NEW, DEAR? NO, NO,  I'VE HAD IT AGES. OH, YES.  I CAN SEE YOU HAVE NOW. I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE THE NICER CHINA. OH, THANK YOU,  HYACINTH. THEY'RE SOMETHING OF A FAMILY HEIRLOOM. OH, GOD, DON'T GIVE ME  ANYTHING SPECIAL. YOU WILL BE CAREFUL,  WON'T YOU, DEAR? BISCUIT? ( cup rattles ) THANK YOU, HYACINTH. I USED TO HAVE SIX OF THESE UNTIL ONE FELL INTO THE HANDS OF MY BROTHER-IN-LAW ONSLOW ONE CHRISTMAS. I COULD'VE KILLED HIM. OF COURSE, ONE CAN'T MAKE A FUSS ON FESTIVE OCCASIONS, BUT HE CERTAINLY GOT  THE SHORT END OF THE TURKEY,  I CAN TELL YOU. DID THEY TELL YOU WHAT  WAS WRONG WITH YOUR FATHER? SOMETHING MILDLY  EMBARRASSING. ONE OF THOSE MINOR  GERIATRIC COMPLAINTS. I COULDN'T CATCH THE MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY. OH. - AAAH! NO, YOU CANNOT HAVE  A NUMBER 24, NOR A DOUBLE PORTION  OF 37. THIS ISN'T  THE CHINESE TAKE-AWAY. THIS IS A PRIVATE SLIMLINE WHITE TELEPHONE WITH NO CONNECTION  WHATSOEVER TO ANY BUSINESS OR TRADE-- ESPECIALLY NOT ONE  OF FOREIGN EXTRACTION. OH, HYACINTH,  I'M SO SORRY. NOW DO STOP  WORRYING, DEAR. WE'RE NOT GOING TO FALL OUT  OVER A CUP AND SAUCER, EVEN A VERY OLD, IRREPLACABLE CUP AND SAUCER. OH, IT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME. BELIEVE ME,  I DO UNDERSTAND. IT CAN'T BE EASY TO BE DAINTY  WHEN YOU'RE ALL THUMBS. THERE, I THINK THAT WILL DO UNTIL I CAN AFFORD A LITTLE MORE TIME. - OH, DEAR.  - WE'RE NOT GOING  TO WORRY ANYMORE ABOUT A BIT  OF EXPENSIVE CARPET AND A CUP THAT'S  BEEN AROUND FOR AGES. WHICH REMINDS ME,  DID YOU SOIL  YOUR DRESS, DEAR? OH, NO!  NO, NO. NO, SURPRISING IT DIDN'T. I'M FINE. THAT'S AMAZING. - WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER  CUP OF EARL GREY? - NO! THANK YOU. - IN A BEAKER, PERHAPS?  - NO, NOTHING. THANK YOU, NO. WELL, IT'S ALL OVER NOW. ALL OVER EVERYWHERE. DO SIT DOWN AGAIN,  ELIZABETH. HAVE YOU HEARD  FROM GAIL RECENTLY? YES, SHE RANG  AT THE WEEKEND. THAT'S NICE.  I THINK A DAUGHTER  ALWAYS SHOULD. GAIL'S VERY GOOD THAT WAY. SO'S MY SHERIDAN. I TREMBLE TO THINK  SOMETIMES WHAT HE SPENDS  ON PHONE CALLS  TO HIS MOTHER. NOT THAT HE CAN'T  AFFORD IT, OF COURSE. THEY GAVE HIM A VERY GOOD  GRANT AT THE POLY, YOU KNOW, TO STOP HIM BEING TEMPTED  BY OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE. GAIL'S STUDYING HARD. WELL, IT'S A STRUGGLE, ISN'T IT, WHEN THEY'RE NOT  ACADEMICALLY GIFTED? OUR GAIL IS ACADEMICALLY GIFTED. IS SHE? OH, WONDER WHO I CAN BE  CONFUSING HER WITH? PERHAPS IT'S THAT BOY  SHE'S LIVING SO OPENLY AND UNASHAMEDLY  UNMARRIED WITH. I HARDLY THINK SO. HAROLD IS A VERY NICE BOY WITH A FIRST-CLASS BRAIN. - IS HE? - YES, HE IS, HYACINTH,  I CAN ASSURE YOU. YOU'D NEVER KNOW  TO LOOK AT HIM, WOULD YOU? ( phone ringing ) I HOPE THAT'S NOT DADDY  GOING SEPTIC. THE "BOUQUET" RESIDENCE,  THE LADY OF THE HOUSE  SPEAKING. OH, IT'S YOU, VIOLET. IT'S MY SISTER, VIOLET. THE ONE WHO MARRIED  THE TURF-ACCOUNTANT. HE BUILT THAT BIG HOUSE  WITH ROOM FOR A SAUNA  AND A PONY. YOU'VE HEARD ME SPEAK  ABOUT VIOLET. FREQUENTLY. SLOW DOWN, VIOLET, DEAR.  YOU SOUND VERY EXCITED. I KNOW IT'S BEEN  A SHOCK ABOUT DADDY. WHAT ARE YOU  EXCITED ABOUT? VIOLET, THAT'S NOT A WORD  I EVER EXPECTED TO HEAR YOU USE  ON A TELEPHONE. BRUCE? WHAT ABOUT BRUCE? I DON-- OH, D-- WELL, I'VE NEVER LIKED HIM  WHOLEHEARTEDLY ON ACCOUNT OF THOSE  ICE CUBES HE SERVES IN THE SHAPE OF NAKED LADIES. WHY SHOULDN'T HE  BUY A WHIP? I EXPECT HE GOT IT  FROM A JOCKEY. WHAT DOES HE USE IT FOR? VIOLET, WOULD YOU RING BACK, DEAR? NO, NO.  ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I'LL STAY ON THE PHONE. - HOLD ON. THERE'S A PERSON  AT THE FRONT DOOR. ELIZABETH, WOULD YOU SEE  TO THAT FOR ME, DEAR? KINDLY INFORM WHOEVER IT IS  THAT I AM AT HOME AND THAT I WILL  RECEIVE THEM MOMENTARILY. NO, DEAR, IT'S ELIZABETH  FROM NEXT DOOR. THAT'S RIGHT, THE ONE WHO'S ALL THUMBS. YOU MET HER ONCE AT ONE  OF MY CANDLELIGHT SUPPERS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU COULDN'T SEE ANYBODY? OH, YES,  SHE'S FINE. SHE'S JUST BROKEN  ONE OF GRANDMOTHER'S CUPS. IT'S A SECURITY LATCH. THERE'S A LITTLE BUTTON. RICHARD HAD IT INSTALLED... TO PROTECT ME  FROM ANYONE DESPERATE. THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE. AH, ELECTRIC. - HAVE YOU BEEN NEXT DOOR?  - YES, THERE'S NOBODY IN. I KNOW, I'M HERE. - I'VE LEFT YOU A CARD. - OH. IT'S THE ELECTRIC MAN TO READ YOUR METER. IS IT THE ONE WITH THE FUNNY MUSTACHE? TELL HER YES. HE SAYS YES. MAKE HIM WAIT THERE  TILL I'VE LOOKED AT HIS FEET. VIOLET,  I HAVE TO GO, DEAR. I'VE GOT THE ELECTRIC. OH MY GOODNESS. I'M SO SORRY. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT MY SISTER. SHE SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A RATHER ACTIVE HOLIDAY. OH, THE SHOES. YOU REMEMBERED  OUR PROCEDURE  FROM LAST TIME. VERY WELL. LEAVE THEM OUTSIDE AND DO COME IN. THANK YOU, DEAR. YOU'RE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT ON THE ONE I HAD BEFORE. HE USED TO BRUSH  AGAINST MY WALLS. OF COURSE I RANG  HIS SUPERIORS. I SAID I WILL NOT HAVE  ELECTRIC MEN BRUSHING  AGAINST MY WALLS. ELIZABETH, CLOSE THE DOOR, DEAR. THE HEAT'S ON. - AH!  - OH! FINGERS. 8321. CORRECT. IS YOUR ELECTRIC  AS CLEAN AS IT WAS,  DO YOU THINK? MY HOPS?? ARE SOMETIMES VERY DIFFICULT TO CLEAN. CLEANEST FUEL THERE IS. IT GOES TO SOME  VERY FUNNY FAMILIES. WOULD YOU HAVE MINE CHECKED TO MAKE QUITE SURE I GET IT FIRST? LEAVE IT WITH ME, LADY. BECAUSE I WON'T HAVE IT  IF IT'S ALREADY BEEN TO SOME  OF THOSE OTHER PLACES. RIGHT-O, MADAM. MUCH OBLIGED. IT'S ONLY ME. SHOULDN'T THAT BE,  "IT'S ONLY I," DEAR? ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE SHOUTING IT WHERE  THE NEIGHBORS CAN HEAR. I'M NOT SURE. NEITHER AM I,  SO YOU MUST BE CAREFUL. HOW'S YOUR FATHER? I RANG, THE WARD SISTER ANSWERED. SHE SAYS HE'S SITTING UP  AND BEGINNING TO TAKE  AN INTEREST... - THAT'S GOOD.  - ...IN THE PHYSIOTHERAPIST. HE THINKS HE'S IN LOVE  WITH THE PHYSIOTHERAPIST. IT'S PROBABLY  JUST THE DRUGS. AND THAT SWINE BRUCE  WANTS MY SISTER TO WEAR  SOME AWFUL LEATHER OUTFIT. OH, IS HE GOING TO TAKE HER MOTORCYCLING? NO, IT'S NOT MOTORCYCLING. IT'S SOMETHING HE PICKED UP IN SPAIN. WHAT, BULLFIGHTING? NO, I DON'T THINK  IT'S THAT EITHER. ANYWAY, DEAR,  ENOUGH OF MY PROBLEMS. - DID YOU MANAGE  TO GET THE PARSLEY? - YES, IN THE KITCHEN. - YOU'LL NEVER GUESS  WHO I BUMPED INTO.  - GOOD. WOULD YOU POLISH  THOSE GLASSES FOR ME, DEAR, AND THEN GIVE ME A HAND  WITH BUFFING UP THE CRUET? ( phone ringing ) SHERIDAN. HOW SENSITIVE OF YOU  TO CALL, DEAR. WHAT A CLOSE PSYCHIC LINK  WE HAVE, YOU AND I. WHAT DOES HE WANT? WANTSANYTHING. HE'S JUST RINGING  HIS MOTHER. YOU NEED HOW MUCH, SHERIDAN? FOR WHAT? YOU'VE JOINED AN ORGANIZATION. THAT'S NICE, DEAR,  MAKING FRIENDS. WHAT KIND  OF AN ORGANIZATION? IS IT LIKE A CLUB,  A GOLF CLUB? NOT A GOLF CLUB. I SEE. JUST A GROUP OF FRIENDS. YOU CALL YOURSELVES  WHAT, DEAR? "THE SWORD OF THE PEOPLE"? DO BE CAREFUL, SHERIDAN. MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT  TOO SHARP. ALWAYS WEAR A MASK. YOU DO WEAR MASKS? OH, THAT'S VERY SENSIBLE. YOU'LL PAY DADDY BACK WHEN? WHEN YOU'VE ROBBED  YOUR FIRST BANK? SHERIDAN! LOOK, DEAR, COULDN'T YOU FIND SOME NICE  PHILATELIC SOCIETY TO JOIN? NO, WE WILL NOT  SEND A CHECK. RICHARD, THAT'S SHERIDAN  ON THE PHONE-- - OHH. NOW LISTEN, SHERIDAN, YOU'VE UPSET YOUR FATHER. OH, MAJOR, I'M SO SORRY. I WAS EXPECTING  ANOTHER CALL. YES. OH, YES,  MY CANDLELIGHT SUPPER  IS STILL ON. OH, IT'S BEEN A FUNNY DAY, BUT WE HAVE TO PRESS ON. WOULD I LIKE SOME FLOWERS  FROM YOUR CONSERVATORY? HOW VERY KIND. YES, I'LL POP ALONG NOW. THAT'S VERY CIVILIZED  OF YOU, MAJOR. BYE. WHAT ABOUT SHERIDAN? DON'T SEND HIM  ANY MONEY. OH, ISN'T THIS DELIGHTFUL? THIS IS SO KIND OF YOU. I'VE CUT SOME  PRIME BLOOMS FOR YOU. OH, LOVELY. OH, YOU GREW THEM ALL YOURSELF. ESPECIALLY FOR YOU. OH... I MUST RUSH.  I'VE LEFT THE OVEN ON. Hyacinth:  I DIDN'T KNOW  YOU WERE SO ATHLETIC. - AAAH. OOH.  - OOH! WHAT'S WRONG NOW? NOTHING IS WRONG. AS FAR AS ANYONE IS CONCERNED, NOTHING IS WRONG. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE  A CANDLELIGHT SUPPER. IT'S GOING TO BE  THE USUAL SUCCESS. I SEE NO REASON FOR TRAILING OUR PROBLEMS IN FRONT OF OUR FRIENDS. IS THE MAJOR COMING? YES, RICHARD, I DO BELIEVE THE MAJOR WILL BE COMING. AND IT'S A GOOD JOB  HE IS A MAJOR. IF HE WAS A SERGEANT  HE WOULDN'T GET A FOOT  PAST THE DOOR. ( theme music playing ) www.tvsubtitles.net
