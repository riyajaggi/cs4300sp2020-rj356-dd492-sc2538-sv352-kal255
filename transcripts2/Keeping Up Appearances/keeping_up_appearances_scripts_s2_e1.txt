 MORNING,
MRS. BUCKET.
 IT'S "BOUQUET."
 I NEVER KNEW THAT.
 TRUST ME.
 TO ME, PEOPLE ARE USUALLY
JUST A NAME ON A NOTE.
 I WILL NOT HAVE
MILKMEN
 REDUCING ME
TO A PIECE OF PAPER.
 IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
MRS. BU-?
 "BOUQUET"?
 IT SEEMS ALL RIGHT.
 BUT IN FUTURE
I WANT YOU TO BE QUITE SURE
 THAT I GET
MY OWN BOTTLES BACK.
 I KNOW THAT MINE
HAVE BEEN PROPERLY WASHED.
 AND I CAN'T BE QUITE SURE
ABOUT OTHER BOTTLES.
 SO PLEASE INFORM
THE PEOPLE AT THE DEPOT
 THAT I WANT
MY OWN BOTTLES BACK.
 ALL BOTTLES
ARE STERILIZED, MRS. BU-
 "BOUQUET."
THE MILK'S PASTEURIZED.
 IT'S A MATTER OF COMPLETE
INDIFFERENCE TO ME
 WHETHER IT'S STERILIZED,
PASTEURIZED, IMMUNIZED OR PRIVATIZED.
 JUST INFORM
YOUR SUPERIORS
 THAT I WANT MY OWN
BOTTLES BACK!
 THERE'S A MAN-NEXT DOOR-
IN ELIZABETH'S HOUSE.
 SORRY, I DON'T SEE
THE SIGNIFICANCE.
 A MAN.
 YES, I HEARD THAT.
 BOLD AS YOU PLEASE.
 IF SHERIDAN WERE HERE
HE'D BE APPALLED.
 STEADY ON, MAYBE SHE'S
GOT THE DECORATOR IN.
 DRAPED IN A TOWEL?
 WELL, AT LEAST
HE SOUNDS CLEAN.
 HYACINTH, PERHAPS HER HUSBAND'S
COME BACK FROM SAUDI ARABIA.
 IT IS NOT
HER HUSBAND.
 I WARNED HER AGAINST
WATCHING CHANNEL 4.
 SHE'LL COME TO NO GOOD IDENTIFYING
WITH THE CONTINENTAL CLASSES.
 ONSLOW.
 WHAT IS IT?
 IT LOOKS LIKE
A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
 HOW NICE.
 WELL IT IS.
LOOK AT IT.
 IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
 RIGHT-GOT IT-
BEAUTIFUL DAY.
 WE HARDLY HAVE
ANY CONVERSATION THESE DAYS.
 EVEN WHEN WE MAKE LOVE
YOU RARELY SPEAK TO ME.
 ESPECIALLY WHEN WE MAKE LOVE
YOU RARELY SPEAK TO ME.
 YOU THINK DOING
TWO THINGS AT ONCE
 IS A FORMULA
FOR SUCCESS.
 IT'S JUST THAT-
AT TIMES LIKE THAT
 A WOMAN LIKES
A LITTLE CONFIRMATION
 THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY
SOMEBODY THERE.
 IT'S THAT MEMORABLE,
IS IT?
 I'LL TELL YOU WHY I DON'T LIKE CHATTING
 WHEN I'M
MAKING LOVE TO YOU.
 BECAUSE THE LAST TIME,
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THINGS,
 YOU SAID TO ME,
"ONSLOW,
 IF I'D HAVE DIED
IN CHILDBIRTH,
 WOULD YOU HAVE
MARRIED AGAIN?"
 WELL, WOULD YOU?
 MARRIED AGAIN? I COULDN'T
EVEN FINISH MAKING LOVE.
 YOU FORGET,
YOU WOMEN,
 IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY
MAKING LOVE TO PEOPLE,
 ESPECIALLY
WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED.
 AND THEN YOU COME UP
WITH A QUESTION LIKE THAT,
 IT AMOUNTS TO OVERLOADING
THE SYSTEM.
 ARE WE GOING
TO GET UP?
 YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO TO PIECES
 JUST BECAUSE IT'S
A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
 WOULD YOU PUT SOMETHING ON,
ROSE? YOU'LL BE UPSETTING ONSLOW.
 NO SHE WON'T. NOT THIS
TIME OF THE MORNING.
 DAD'S GONE AGAIN.
HE LEFT A NOTE THIS TIME.
 "CONDITION RED,
ENEMY AIRCRAFT APPROACHING.
 DON'T GET UP,
I'LL HANDLE IT.
 HAVE YOU SEEN
MY RATION BOOK? DAD."
 NOW WE'LL
HAVE TO GET UP.
 I'LL KILL YOUR FATHER.
 HOW COULD SHE-
 NEXT TO A HOUSE
OF THIS CALIBER?
 HAD I KNOWN,
I'D NEVER HAVE GONE
 TO THE EXPENSE
OF DOUBLE GLAZING.
 THERE'S NO POINT
IN GETTING UPSET.
 THERE'S PROBABLY SOME
PERFECTLY HARMLESS EXPLANATION.
 HOW CAN THERE BE
A HARMLESS EXPLANATION
 TO A STRANGE MAN
IN THE HOUSE?
 INFORMALLY DRESSED
WITH A DEBAUCHED EXPRESSION?
 AND OBVIOUSLY BEEN THERE
ALL NIGHT.
 YOU DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S
BEEN THERE ALL NIGHT.
 IF HE'S THERE
DRAPED IN A TOWEL
 WHEN THE MILK ARRIVES,
HE'S BEEN THERE ALL NIGHT.
 YES, IT'S
A REASONABLE CONCLUSION.
 I MEAN,
JUST IMAGINE,
 IF SHE KEEPS HIM, WE COULD
BE SHARING MILK BOTTLES.
 I WILL NOT SHARE MILK BOTTLES
WITH AN ILLICIT LOVE NEST.
 IT'S REALLY NONE
OF OUR BUSINESS.
 OF COURSE IT'S MY BUSINESS.
ELIZABETH IS MY FRIEND.
 I JUST CAN'T STAND
IDLY BY
 WHEN SHE'S SINKING
INTO MORAL TURPITUDE.
 I CAN'T SEE LIZ
 SINKING INTO
MORAL TURPITUDE.
 I WON'T ALLOW IT.
 WE MUST SAVE HER
FROM HERSELF.
 I CANNOT HAVE
MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR
 TURNING HER HOME
INTO A HOUSE OF ILL REPUTE.
 HYACINTH!
 JUST THINK WHAT IT COULD
DO TO THE PROPERTY VALUES.
 ONSLOW,
AREN'T YOU UP YET?
 I'M THINKING.
 IT'S NO GOOD
GOING OFF
 HALF-COCKED
IN THESE LITTLE EMERGENCIES.
 SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO KEEP A COOL HEAD
 AND DO THE PLANNING.
 THERE'S NOBODY SEEN HIM
IN THE STREET.
 HER AT THE SHOP HASN'T SEEN HIM,
AND SHE NEVER MISSES A THING.
 IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRACK HIM
DOWN THE FIRST THING TO DO
 IS FIND OUT
WHAT HE'S WEARING.
 RIGHT.
 SEE WHAT I MEAN ABOUT
PLANNING? A COOL HEAD.
 ALL HIS STREET CLOTHES ARE THERE.
HE'S NOT WEARING ANY OF THEM.
 SO NOW WE KNOW
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR-
 AN OLD MAN
IN PAJAMAS.
 WRONG.
 OH, NICE.
 WE'LL HAVE TO MOVE!
 MOVE?!
 I SHALL MISS
THIS HOUSE.
 OVER THE YEARS, I HAVE MADE IT
A CENTER OF CULTURE AND TASTE.
 WHY SHOULD WE
HAVE TO MOVE?
 IF THIS AREA IS HEADING
FOR A MORAL DECLINE,
 WHAT CHOICE HAVE WE?
 I WILL NOT RAISE SHERIDAN
 IN A CONTINENTAL
ATMOSPHERE.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE
ELIZABETH'S INVOLVED
 IN ANYTHING
CONTINENTAL.
 WELL, I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT, EITHER.
 HOW FORTUNATE
YOU ARE, RICHARD,
 TO HAVE A WIFE OF IMPECCABLE
MORAL RECTITUDE.
 WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CUP OF TEA,
 HAVE A FAG AND DECIDE
ON A PLAN OF OPERATION.
 ONSLOW'S VERY GOOD
IN EMERGENCIES.
 I SHOULD THINK SO.
THE WAY HE LIVES-
 LOOK AT THE PRACTICE
HE'S HAD.
 HERE IT IS-
 PLAN "A."
 I'LL STAY HERE IN CASE HE COMES
HOME, YOU TWO GO AND LOOK FOR HIM.
 OH, I CAN'T GO.
 I'M EXPECTING A PHONE CALL
FROM MR. BICKERSTAFF.
 WHO'S MR. BICKERSTAFF?
- WHO'S MR. BICKERSTAFF?
 HE'S ONLY THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.
 A CHANCE
TO START AGAIN,
 TO BUILD
ON THE SECURITY...
 OF SOMEONE
WHO CARES FOR ME.
 I THOUGHT THAT WAS
MR. CRABTREE.
 DON'T SPEAK TO ME
ABOUT THAT SWINE.
 YOU SAID
YOU LOVED HIM MADLY.
 IN FACT, WE COULD
HEAR YOU LOVING HIM MADLY.
 THAT WAS
A TRAGIC MISTAKE.
 I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT LOVE WAS
 UNTIL ALONG CAME
MR. BICKERSTAFF.
 I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE
UNTIL I'VE HAD HIS PHONE CALL.
 HE'LL PANIC IF I'M NOT HERE
TO TELL HIM I LOVE HIM.
 YOU GO WITH DAISY!
 IF A BICKERSTAFF RINGS,
I'LL TELL HIM YOU LOVE HIM.
 I KNOW YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME, RICHARD.
 I HAVE TO GO
TO WORK, HYACINTH.
 NOT UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN IT
WITH YOUR OWN EYES.
 ELIZABETH HAS
A MAN IN THE HOUSE.
 I STILL FEEL
IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.
 THE TONE OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY BUSINESS.
 IT IS NOT WITHOUT ENORMOUS
EFFORT ON MY PART
 THAT THIS DISTRICT HAS ONE OF THE
MOST SOUGHT-AFTER POSTAL CODES.
 I CAN'T JUST
GO OUT THERE
 AND STARE
AT ELIZABETH'S HOUSE.
 NO, OF COURSE
YOU MUSTN'T STARE, DEAR.
 WE'RE NOT
ONES TO PRY.
 NOW, I SHALL PRETEND
 TO SEE YOU
OFF TO WORK.
 YOU WILL TURN AND WAVE
AS YOU NORMALLY DO.
 DO I NORMALLY
TURN AND WAVE?
 YOU WILL TURN
AND WAVE, RICHARD.
 THIS WILL GIVE YOU
AN OPPORTUNITY
 TO CAST YOUR EYE OVER ELIZABETH'S HOUSE.
 WELL, WHAT IF
I DON'T SEE HIM?
 THEN YOU WILL PRETEND THAT
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING.
 AND YOU WILL RETURN
TO THE HOUSE.
 AND THEN WE'LL
DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.
 OFF YOU GO, RICHARD.
 I'VE FORGOTTEN
SOMETHING.
 I'VE FORGOTTEN
SOMETHING AGAIN.
 LIZ,
 WHO'S THE IDIOT
NEXT DOOR?
 OH, THAT'S RICHARD.
 OH, HE'S RATHER
A DEAR, REALLY.
 A BIT FORGETFUL,
ISN'T HE?
 THAT'S THREE TIMES HE'S
BEEN BACK TO THE HOUSE.
 BEING MARRIED
TO HYACINTH,
 IT'S A MIRACLE
HE GOES BACK AT ALL.
 NOW DID YOU SEE HIM THAT TIME?
- I COULDN'T SEE A THING.
 OH, WHY IS IT
MEN NEVER NOTICE THINGS?
 I NOTICE I'LL BE
LATE FOR THE OFFICE.
 DON'T INTERRUPT ME
WHILE I'M THINKING, DEAR.
 IF HE WON'T
SHOW HIMSELF,
 WE MUST
FLUSH HIM OUT.
 TEAR GAS?
 RICHARD?
 I WILL GO ROUND NOW
TO ELIZABETH'S HOUSE
 ON SOME
INNOCENT ERRAND.
 I'LL INVITE HER TO ANOTHER
OF MY CANDLELIGHT SUPPERS.
 YOU WILL STAY HERE
 AND KEEP WATCH.
 AS SOON AS ELIZABETH
HAS LET ME IN
 THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR,
 10 TO ONE, YOU'LL SEE THE
MAN SNEAK OUT OF THE BACK
 SCURRYING AWAY.
 IT'S TIME THAT I WAS
SCURRYING AWAY.
 SHE'S NOT LISTENING. HOW DOES
SHE MANAGE NEVER TO LISTEN?
 I WISH I COULD
GET THE HANG OF IT.
 RICHARD!
WE MUST WARN HER
 AGAINST THE DANGERS
OF STRANGE MEN.
 ME?
 YES, YOU, DEAR.
WHY AREN'T YOU LISTENING?
 AND YOU MUST
DO IT TACTFULLY.
 WHILE I'VE CORNERED HER,
YOU MUST MAKE YOUR APPEARANCE
 AND BEGIN TALKING CASUALLY ABOUT
HOW YOU'VE SEEN IT IN THE PAPERS.
 SEEN WHAT?
- THE DANGERS OF GETTING INVOLVED WITH STRANGE MEN.
 SHE'LL THINK
I'M THE STRANGE MAN.
 OH, NOW DON'T
BE SILLY, DEAR.
 I AM RELYING ON YOU,
RICHARD.
 DON'T FAIL ME.
 LET'S RESTORE
THIS AREA
 TO A PLACE FIT FOR SHERIDAN TO LIVE IN.
 GO ON,
TO YOUR POST.
 JAWOHL.
 GOOD MORNING.
- OH, GOOD MORNING.
 HELLO, CAN YOU HANG ON
A MINUTE, PLEASE?
 I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
 OH, IT'S YOU,
DAISY.
 NO, SHE'S JUST
POPPED NEXT DOOR.
 WHICH REMINDS ME,
HANG ON.
 I DON'T EXPECT SHE'LL BE LONG.
IS IT URGENT?
 OH, YOUR FATHER,
YES.
 NO, I'LL TELL HER. I'VE GOT
TO POP NEXT DOOR MYSELF.
 YES, BYE.
 YOU SEE IT
IN THE PAPERS.
 TERRIBLE.
WOMEN LIVING ALONE.
 GETTING INVOLVED WITH
STRANGE MEN. VERY UNWISE.
 SOUNDS BARMY.
 YOU CAN'T OPEN
A CONVERSATION LIKE THAT.
 HELLO, LIZ. HAVE YOU
SEEN IT IN THE PAPERS?
 WOMEN LIVING ALONE GETTING
INVOLVED WITH STRANGE MEN.
 OH, I CAN'T
SAY THAT.
 ON THE OTHER HAND,
HYACINTH WILL BE
 STANDING THERE
WAITING FOR ME TO SAY THAT.
 I CAN SAY THAT.
 HELLO, RICHARD.
 ELIZABETH, HI.
 WHAT IS IT?
- ELIZABETH, I-
 YES, RICHARD?
 I HAVE
TO SPEAK TO YOU.
 OH, WELL,
COME IN.
 FORCES OVER WHICH
I HAVE NO CONTROL
 ARE INSISTING THAT I SPEAK TO YOU.
- YES, RICHARD.
 HAVE YOU SEEN IT
IN THE PAPERS?
 HAVE I SEEN WHAT?
 ABOUT STRANGE MEN-
- RICHARD! RICHARD!
 YOU HAVEN'T MET ELIZABETH'S
BROTHER, HAVE YOU?
 BROTHER?
- ELIZABETH'S BROTHER!
 OH, I'M SORRY.
 I'VE JUST BEEN TELLING
EMMET ALL ABOUT YOU.
 EMMET, THIS IS RICHARD.
RICHARD, MY BROTHER EMMET.
 HELLO, RICHARD.
- HE'LL BE STAYING HERE FOR A WHILE.
 I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW GLAD I AM TO HEAR THAT.
 THAT I SHALL BE
STAYING HERE FOR A WHILE?
 NO, THAT YOU'RE
HER BROTHER.
 WELL, HYACINTH-
 NO! NOW STOP
BABBLING, RICHARD.
 IT'S TIME YOU GOT BACK
TO THE OFFICE.
 HE HAS VERY LARGE
RESPONSIBILITIES.
 I DON'T LIKE HIM BEING
LATE FOR THE OFFICE.
 HYACINTH, YOUR SISTER'S BEEN ON THE PHONE.
 OH, MY SISTER VIOLET.
 SHE MARRIED A TURF ACCOUNTANT.
THEY HAVE A VERY LARGE HOUSE,
 A SWIMMING POOL
AND ROOM FOR A PONY.
 NO, DAISY.
- OH, DAISY.
 EXCUSE ME, DEAR.
 EMMET.
 AND LATER ON
THERE'LL BE
 A LITTLE CANDLELIGHT SUPPER
SOMETIME, TO LOOK FORWARD TO.
 EMMET.
 JUST A SMALL
SELECT GATHERING.
 LIVING NEXT DOOR TO US,
YOU'LL SOON LEARN
 THAT YOU'RE
AT THE CENTER
 OF THE CULTURAL HUB
OF THINGS ROUND HERE.
 I MUST BE LEAVING FOR THE OFFICE.
- AGAIN.
 AS THE FRENCH SAY.
 TE44TE-AOO-TE44TE
 YE GODS!
 IS THE WOMAN ALWAYS
LIKE THAT?
 IT WAS HER BROTHER
ALL THE TIME.
 HE'S LOST HIS HOUSE
IN A MESSY DIVORCE
 AND HE NEEDS
SOMEWHERE TO LIVE.
 I KNEW ELIZABETH
WAS BEYOND MORAL REPROACH.
 I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU PUT THAT
IDEA IN MY HEAD IN THE FIRST PLACE.
 YOU DON'T IMAGINE I COULD HAVE
BEEN FRIENDS ALL THESE YEARS,
 WITH A PERSON
OF LOW MORAL FIBRE?
 IT WAS SHORT-SIGHTED
OF YOU, RICHARD.
 ACTUALLY,
IT WAS YOU WHO SAID-
 YES, I DID,
DIDN'T I?
 AND YOU SEE
HOW RIGHT I WAS.
 I MUST GO
TO THE OFFICE.
 COME INSIDE
FOR A MOMENT, RICHARD.
 THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.
 IT'S QUITE EXCITING.
 TELL ME HERE.
 I THINK CHATTING
IN THE STREET
 IS VERY COMMON,
DON'T YOU?
 HYACINTH-!
- NO, NO, NO!
 WILL IT BE LONG-
- SHH! SHH!
 I'M TELLING YOU-
 EMMET IS
A MUSICIAN.
 HE TEACHES MUSIC.
 A CLASSICALLY
TRAINED MUSICIAN.
 DON'T YOU REALIZE
WHAT THAT MEANS?
 ABOUT ?25 AN HOUR,
I SHOULD THINK.
 CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT AN ASSET HE'LL BE
 AT MY LITTLE
MUSICAL SOIRE!ES?
 OH, THOSE,
YES.
 DOES HE KNOW THAT YOU GIVE
LITTLE MUSICAL SOIRE!ES?
 NO, DEAR,
NOT YET.
 BUT I'M NOT ONE
TO PUSH MY TALENTS FORWARD.
 I'LL LET THAT JUST EMERGE NATURALLY.
- YEAH.
 BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
THE BEST BIT.
 REALLY?
 HE PRODUCES AND DIRECTS
THE AMATEUR OPERATIC SOCIETY!
 IT'S A WONDER HE FOUND TIME
TO GET DIVORCED.
 SO YOU MUST BE
PREPARED, RICHARD.
 AS SOON AS HE
HEARS ME SING,
 HE'LL START PESTERING ME
TO PLAY A LEADING ROLE.
 AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT
TO ASK YOU, DEAR.
 WILL IT BE FAIR
TO SHERIDAN,
 A MOTHER
ON THE STAGE?
 WHERE DID YOU PUT
MY BRIEFCASE?
 BECAUSE I'M HAVING HIM ROUND FOR
COFFEE AND THE QUESTION MAY ARISE.
 DON'T FORGET TO RING
YOUR DAISY.
 OH, YES, DEAR, YES, I WILL
WHEN I'VE GOT A MOMENT.
 AH.
- WHEN I'VE DECIDED THE DETAILS OF MY DEBUT.
 DADDY'S NOWHERE ROUND THE BLOCK!
- NOBODY'S SEEN HIM.
 DID OUR HYACINTH RING?
- NO.
 DID MR. BICKERSTAFF RING?
- NOBODY RANG.
 ONSLOW, YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE CAR
OUT, LOVE. WE HAVE TO GO AND TELL HER.
 WHAT IF
MR. BICKERSTAFF RINGS?
 YOU CAN PHONE MR. BICKERSTAFF
AT OUR HYACINTH'S.
 ON A WHITE SLIMLINE
PUSH-BUTTON TELEPHONE.
 GOODBYE, DEAR.
 HAVE A NICE DAY.
 WHAT'S LEFT OF IT.
 WHY ARE YOU SINGING?
- HMM?
 OUT HERE
IN THE OPEN LIKE THAT?
 RICHARD,
WHAT A QUESTION, DEAR.
 YOU KNOW I LOVE TO SING.
 OH, ELIZABETH, DEAR.
 DON'T FORGET
COFFEE AT 10:45, WILL YOU?
 * ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT... *
 MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
PUT ON A SHIRT.
 NOBODY SAID
IT WAS FORMAL.
 I'LL DIE
IF I MISS MR. BICKERSTAFF.
 Both:
OH, SHUT UP, ROSE!
 COME ON, EMMET,
SHE SAID 10:45.
 IT HAS TO BE
EXACTLY 10:45?
 BELIEVE ME,
IT'S EASIER.
 AH, THERE YOU ARE.
 AND ALMOST ON TIME.
 COME IN.
 * COME IN. *
 AND THERE'S SHERIDAN AT SHERINGHAM
IN HIS LITTLE SAILOR SUIT.
 SUPER.
 AND THERE HE IS DAWDLING
ON A DONKEY AT DAWLISH.
 BLESS HIM,
HE WAS FEARLESS.
 THEN WHY IS HE CRYING?
 WELL-
 BECAUSE THE DONKEY WAS CARRYING
HIM AWAY FROM HIS MOMMY.
 WE WERE ALWAYS VERY CLOSE.
 ANOTHER CUP OF AROMATIC
NUT-ROASTED SPECIAL?
 NO!
 NO, THANK YOU.
I'M FINE.
 ELIZABETH,
YOURS MUST BE COLD.
 NO, NO!
THANK YOU, HYACINTH.
 I'M ALWAYS A BIT UNEASY
WITH YOUR BEST CHINA.
 NO, I'M QUITE HAPPY
WITH MY BISCUIT.
 GOOD, BUT JUST WATCH
THE CRUMBS, WON'T YOU?
 MY ROYAL DOULTON
HAND-PAINTED PERIWINKLE
 IS NOT REALLY MY BEST CHINA.
 IT'S JUST MY EVERYDAY BEST.
 MY REALLY BEST BEST, I
SHALL KEEP FOR ANOTHER TIME.
 WHEN YOU COME
FOR A MORE FORMAL OCCASION.
 PERHAPS A LITTLE
MUSICAL SOIRE!E,
 FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE
CANDLELIGHT SUPPER.
 NOW, I'VE GOT
ANOTHER ALBUM SOMEWHERE.
 WELL, THANK YOU
FOR THE COFFEE
 AND THE TOUR THROUGH YOUR
ALBUMS, BUT WE HAVE TO BE GOING.
 NO, YOU CAN'T GO NOW!
 NOT NOW.
NOT RIGHT NOW.
 NOT UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN
THE OTHER ALBUM.
 DESOLATE AS I AM
I NOT TO SEE ANOTHER ALBUM-
 EXCUSE ME, DON'T MOVE!
 JUST SIT THERE.
 I'LL BE BACK.
 WHATEVER YOU THINK!
 OH, LET'S GO.
 I DON'T THINK I CAN FACE
YET ANOTHER ALBUM.
 NO, SHE SAID
DON'T MOVE.
 WE CAN'T EXACTLY
BE UNDER HOUSE ARREST.
 CAN WE?
 GO AND FIND DADDY IMMEDIATELY.
- WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT.
 CAN'T I MAKE A PHONE CALL
TO MR. BICKERSTAFF?
 NO, ROSE.
 NOT TO ONE OF YOUR GENTLEMEN FRIENDS
ON MY WHITE SLIMLINE TELEPHONE,
 THE INSTRUMENT THROUGH WHICH
I HAVE TO SPEAK TO SHERIDAN.
 SUPPOSING THERE WERE
A CROSSED LINE
 AND HE PICKED UP SOME
RESIDUE OF YOUR CONVERSATION?
 YOU MUST GO AND FIND
DADDY NOW.
 WE THOUGHT
HE MIGHT BE HERE.
 DADDY WOULD NEVER
COME HERE
 LOOKING FOR HIS
RATION BOOK.
 NOT IN HIS LONGJOHNS.
 NOW, GO AND FIND HIM
IMMEDIATELY.
 WILL YOU GET
INTO THE CAR, ONSLOW?
 NOW, ONSLOW.
 SHE COULD DO WITH A DROP
OF WATER FOR THE RADIATOR.
 THE WATER HERE
WOULDN'T BE SUITABLE
 FOR YOUR KIND OF RADIATOR.
 THAT'S IT.
THAT SOUNDS FINE.
 OFF YOU GO, ONSLOW.
 BUT HYACINTH,
SUPPOSING DADDY-
 GOODBYE, DEAR. GIVE ME
A RING IF YOU FIND DADDY.
 POOR DADDY.
 OUT THERE SOMEWHERE,
 LUFTWAFFE.
 WE'LL HAVE TO BE GOING,
HYACINTH.
 EMMET HAS WORK TO DO.
 NEVER MIND, DEAR.
 THERE'LL BE MANY
OTHER OCCASIONS.
 OH... SPLENDID.
 DID YOU SEE THAT?
 WHO IS HE?
- IT WAS DADDY.
 MY FATHER'S A LEADING
COMPETITOR
 IN THE OVER 70s
BICYCLE RACE.
 I EXPECT HIS NUMBER
FELL OFF IN THE EXCITEMENT.
 WHY IS HE WEARING LONGJOHNS
AND A STEEL HELMET?
 FANCY DRESS-
FOR CHARITY.
 BRAVE DADDY.
 RISKING THE ELEMENTS AT HIS
AGE FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES.
 THE OLD SCHOOL,
YOU KNOW.
 COMING, DADDY.
 I MUST REFRESH HIM
WITH ORANGE JUICE
 BEFORE HE TACKLES
THE NEXT 100 LAPS.
 YES, THE OLD SCHOOL.
 IT'S HIS KIND OF SPIRIT
THAT KEEPS ONE GOING
 WHEN EVERYTHING APPEARS
TO BE COLLAPSING.
 * THERE'LL ALWAYS BE... *
