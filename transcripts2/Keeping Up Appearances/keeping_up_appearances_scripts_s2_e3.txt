 Keeping Up Appearances (1990â€“1995): Season 2, Episode 3 - The Candlelight Supper - full transcript 
 After a haughty complaint about passing garbage bins, Hyacinth inspects the garden and issues command-invitations for another widely feared candlelight supper. It's a nightmarish first for Emmet, who still harbors futile illusions of resistance, soon squashed by experienced Elizabeth, who somehow survives another coffee visit. Meanwhile Rose arrives, followed by her present rival suitors, who flee when they hear the racket (even from outdoors) while inside musician Emmet endures the hosts' toneless recital.

 THE "BOUQUET" RESIDENCE,
THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SPEAKING.
 YOU ARE WHOM? ACTUALLY, I
THINK THAT SHOULD BE WHO.
 WHO?
 THE DEPARTMENT
OF REFUSE SERVICE OFFICES.
 OH, YOU MEAN
THE RUBBISH PEOPLE?
 YES, I AM THE LADY
WHO'S BEEN RINGING
 ALL WEEK
WITH A COMPLAINT.
 YES, THANK YOU FOR FINALLY
RETURNING MY CALL.
 MY COMPLAINT IS ABOUT
YOUR DUSTBIN LORRIES.
 ALL RIGHT,
YOUR COLLECTION VEHICLES.
 THEY WILL KEEP
PASSING DOWN MY AVENUE.
 NOW I DON'T MIND THEM
COMING ON TUESDAY
 BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN
I PUT MY DUSTBIN OUT.
 BUT I WISH
YOU WOULD FORBID THEM
 TO PASS DOWN MY AVENUE
ON OTHER DAYS.
 IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION
THAT I SPECIALIZE
 IN SUPERFLUOUS
AMOUNTS OF GARBAGE.
 OH, I KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING,
 THEY'RE TAKING
THE SHORTCUT
 AND I'D LIKE YOU
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
 WELL, IF THAT'S
YOUR EXCUSE
 I WOULDN'T EVEN PUT IT
IN A BLACK PLASTIC BAG
 AND STUFF IT
IN A DUSTBIN.
 HELLO? HELLO?
 HELLO?
 BOLSHIE BIN MAN!
 OH, YOU FEEL LIKE DOING A LITTLE
GARDENING. THAT'S PROGRESS.
 BETTER THAN STAYING IN
AND MOPING ABOUT YOUR DIVORCE.
 I'M QUITE GOOD AT GARDENING.
- GOOD, THAT'S SPLENDID.
 THERE'S PLENTY OF IT
OUT THERE WAITING.
 WHAT I WASN'T
GOOD AT WAS MARRIAGE.
 THAT WAS HARDLY YOUR FAULT.
SHE RAN OFF WITH ANOTHER MAN.
 WHO WASN'T EVEN
GOOD AT GARDENING.
 OH.
GO ON, OFF YOU GO.
 AHHH!
 WHAT'S WRONG?
 IT'S HER-
HYACINTH!
 SHE'S OUT THERE-
IN HER GARDEN.
 YOU CAN'T STAY INDOORS JUST
BECAUSE HYACINTH'S OUT THERE.
 I CAN.
I REALLY CAN.
 OH, EMMET,
DON'T BE SILLY.
 SHE'LL SING AT ME.
SHE ALWAYS SINGS AT ME.
 SHE WANTS YOU
TO GIVE HER
 A PART IN YOUR
AMATEUR OPERATICS.
 IF YOU START A CONVERSATION WITH HER,
 SHE'D HAVE
TO STOP SINGING.
 THEN SHE'LL
TALK TO ME.
 BEING TALKED TO BY HYACINTH IS
ALMOST AS BAD AS BEING SUNG AT.
 TELEPHONE,
HYACINTH.
 RICHARD,
 DON'T SHOUT, DEAR.
 IT'S SO COMMON.
 TELEPHONE, HYACINTH.
 HMM?
 IS IT MY SHERIDAN?
 NO, IT'S
YOUR SISTER VIOLET.
 OH, MY SISTER VIOLET
 WITH THE LUXURY BUNGALOW
AND THE SWIMMING POOL...
 RICHARD,
I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
 THAT SOMETHING'S POOPED
IN MY POLYANTHAS.
 HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO INTERPRET THAT?
 DOES SHE WANT IT
CONFIRMING OR REMOVING?
 I'D BETTER ASK.
 SHH.
 I'M SO GLAD YOU RANG,
VIOLET,
 BECAUSE IT SAVES ME
MAKING A CALL
 TO INVITE YOURSELF AND BRUCE TO A
LITTLE CANDLELIGHT SUPPER THIS EVENING.
 WHY CAN'T YOU COME?
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'VE NOTHING TO WEAR?
 VIOLET, YOU'VE A WARDROBE
OF BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES.
 BRUCE IS WEARING THEM?
 WELL, HE CAN'T BE
WEARING ALL OF THEM.
 I SEE, HE'S VERY
POSSESSIVE ABOUT THEM.
 VIOLET, REALLY,
YOU MUST BE FIRMER WITH HIM.
 I DON'T CARE
HOW DISAPPOINTED HE'LL BE,
 YOU MUST NOT START
CALLING HIM BRENDA.
 NOW LOOK,
TAKE A FIRM STAND.
 IT'S TIME YOU BEGAN
WEARING THE TROUSERS.
 OH, YOU ARE WEARING
THE TROUSERS.
 IT'S ALL
YOU'VE GOT LEFT.
 WHAT'S WRONG?
 IT'S BRUCE AGAIN.
 HE'S WEARING
ALL VIOLET'S CLOTHES.
 OH, NOT THAT
KNITTED TWO-PIECE.
 I CAN'T BEAR HIM
IN THAT KNITTED TWO-PIECE.
 POOR VIOLET.
 I KNOW HOW SHE
MUST HATE IT.
 ESPECIALLY AS HE'S STARTED
TO LOOK BETTER THAN SHE DOES.
 WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT, ONSLOW?
 I WAS WONDERING,
 IF THERE IS A FORCE
BEHIND THE UNIVERSE,
 ON BALANCE, WOULD YOU
CLASS IT AS "A" ALIEN,
 OR "B" FRIENDLY?
 I WISH YOU'D STOP
WATCHING "OPEN UNIVERSITY."
 MAN HAS THIS RESTLESS URGE TO UNDERSTAND.
 TO UNDERSTAND WHAT?
 FOR A START, WHY YOU KEEP
YOUR KNEE IN MY BACK ALL NIGHT.
 DO I KEEP MY KNEE
IN YOUR BACK?
 IF IT'S NOT YOUR KNEE,
SOMEBODY'S WEARING BOOTS IN BED.
 YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE
IF I DID WEAR BOOTS IN BED.
 YOU NEVER NOTICED
WHEN I GOT THAT NEW NIGHTIE.
 LET ME GIVE YOU A TINY
WORD OF ADVICE, DAISE-
 NOW YOU'LL NOT FIND THIS
IN YOUR ROMANTIC NOVELS,
 BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO WEAR A
SEE-THROUGH NIGHTIE, DON'T WEAR A VEST.
 A PERSON COULD
FREEZE TO DEATH
 NOT WEARING A VEST
WAITING FOR YOU TO WARM UP!
 WE MADE LOVE
ONLY RECENTLY.
 IT WAS MARCH.
 WAS IT MARCH?
 GOOD GRIEF, DOESN'T TIME FLY
WHEN YOU'RE ENJOYING YOURSELF.
 HE'S COMING!
HE'S COMING!
 IF IT'S THE INSURANCE MAN,
TELL HIM I'LL SEE HIM NEXT WEEK.
 IT'S NOT
THE INSURANCE MAN,
 IT'S MR. HELLIWELL-
MY MR. HELLIWELL!
 HE'S COMING TO PICK
ME UP HERE LATER.
 I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED-SOME
ATTENTION FROM MR. HELLIWELL.
 I DON'T WANT HIM
PICKING ME UP HERE!
 I MEAN, LOOK AT THE STATE
OF THE PLACE.
 YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO TIDY UP.
 IT'S YOUR LOVE LIFE,
YOU TIDY UP.
 I'VE ONLY JUST
GROWN MY NAILS BACK.
 LET MR. HELLIWELL COME EARLY
AND HE CAN TIDY UP.
 BUG OFF, ONSLOW.
 OH, NICE.
 WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
 YE GODS, HYACINTH.
 GOOD MORNING, EMMET.
 JUST THE PERSON
I WANTED TO SEE.
 I'D LIKE YOU AND ELIZABETH
TO COME THIS EVENING
 TO MY LITTLE
CANDLELIGHT SUPPER.
 THANKS, BUT I WAS
PLANNING TO-
 I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO ENTERTAINING YOU.
 I MEAN, ORDINARILY
I'D BE ONLY TOO HAPPY TO-
 JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD
A BAD DIVORCE,
 YOU MUSTN'T KEEP YOURSELF
CONFINED TO THE HOUSE.
 I RATHER LIKE
BEING ALONE, ACTUALLY.
 YOU MUST GET ABOUT,
EMMET, AND MEET PEOPLE.
 AND YOU'LL MEET
ONLY THE BEST PEOPLE
 AT MY LITTLE
CANDLELIGHT SUPPERS.
 I'D BE THERE IN A MINUTE
IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT-
 GOOD, THAT'S
SETTLED THEN.
 DRESS INFORMAL-
LOUNGE SUIT AND TIE, OF COURSE.
 * I'VE GOT
A WONDERFUL FEELING *
 * EVERYTHING'S
GOING MY WAY. *
 WHATEVER'S THE MATTER?
 SHE'S BEEN SINGING
AT ME, LIZ.
 I TOLD YOU SHE WOULD.
 OH, IS THAT ALL?
 NO, IT IS NOT ALL!
 WE'RE INVITED TO A CANDLELIGHT
SUPPER TONIGHT.
 WELL, THAT WAS
INEVITABLE.
 THERE COMES TO US ALL
IN THIS AREA
 NOT ONLY THE CERTAINTY
OF DEATH AND TAXES,
 BUT PERIODICALLY,
 ONE OF HYACINTH'S
CANDLELIGHT SUPPERS.
 YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO GRIN AND BEAR IT.
 DON'T GRUNT WHEN YOU
POLISH, RICHARD.
 I CAN HEAR YOU
BREATHING, DEAR.
 I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE NICE
TO HEAR PEOPLE BREATHING.
 YOU'D THINK BY NOW
EVOLUTION WOULD'VE
 REPLACED OUR UNFORTUNATE
BODILY FUNCTIONS
 WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE
MORE TASTEFUL.
 I SUPPOSE IT WAS
PERFECTLY ADEQUATE
 FOR PRIMITIVE PEOPLES,
BUT REALLY.
 WELL, WE ARE MERELY
MAMMALS AFTER ALL.
 RICHARD,
 WHAT A THING TO SAY
TO SOMEBODY
 WITH A SOLID SILVER,
SELF-CLEANING SAUCE SEPARATOR.
 NOW I KNOW
THAT THIS EVENING
 IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER
HUGE SUCCESS.
 I SHALL USE
MY ROYAL WORCESTER
 DOUBLE-GLAZED AVIGNON,
OF COURSE.
 I USED IT THE LAST TIME
BUT NOBODY NOTICED.
 THIS TIME,
RICHARD,
 YOU WILL WAIT FOR A LAPSE
IN THE CONVERSATION
 AND THEN YOU WILL INTRODUCE
THE TOPIC CASUALLY.
 WHAT TOPIC?
- THAT WE'RE ALL DINING
 FROM MY ROYAL WORCESTER,
DOUBLE-GLAZED AVIGNON.
 I PARTICULARLY WANT EMMET
TO APPRECIATE IT.
 EMMET'S RECOVERING
FROM A MESSY DIVORCE.
 DO YOU REALLY THINK HE'LL BE OVERWHELMED BY
YOUR ROYAL WORCESTER DOUBLE-GLAZED AVIGNON?
 HE'LL FIND IT
A GREAT COMFORT TO REALIZE
 THAT HE'S IN CIVILIZED
SURROUNDINGS, DEAR.
 OH, THAT'S NICE.
VERY NICE, DEAR.
 JUST WIPE YOUR FINGERMARKS
OFF THAT, WILL YOU?
 WHY ME?
 WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO GO
TO HER CANDLELIGHT SUPPER?
 I'VE SUFFERED ENOUGH,
LATELY.
 OH, EMMET.
 IT'S NO WORSE
THAN A BAD DREAM.
 A COUPLE OF HOURS AND IT'S ALL OVER.
- A COUPLE OF HOURS?!
 THERE'LL BE OTHER PEOPLE-
EQUALLY STUNNED.
 YOU MIGHT MEET
SOMEONE YOU LIKE.
 WHAT'S THE USE IF SHE'S
GOING TO BE SINGING AT ME?
 WELL, STICK WITH RICHARD.
RICHARD'S NICE.
 HOW DOES HE
LIVE WITH HER?
 I'VE OFTEN WONDERED
ABOUT THAT.
 I EXPECT HE'S
USED TO IT.
 I THINK THAT'S AWFUL-
 THAT ANY POOR DEVIL
SHOULD BE USED TO IT.
 AH, THERE YOU ARE!
 I THINK
YOUR LITTLE DOGGIE
 DROPPED SOMETHING
HERE, YESTERDAY.
 FROM HIS COLLAR?
HE STILL HAS HIS DISK.
 NOT HIS COLLAR, NO.
 I'M SURE IT'S YOURS AND I'D
LIKE TO RETURN IT TO YOU.
 THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT.
 COME ALONG.
 I'LL SHOW YOU.
 OH.
 TSK-TSK-TSK.
 THANK YOU.
 WELL, ARE WE GOING
TO TIDY UP?
 ASK ONSLOW.
HE'S MASTER OF THE HOUSE.
 ONSLOW, MR. HELLIWELL'S COMING!
 DON'T YOU THINK
WE OUGHT TO TIDY UP?
 GIVEN THE TRANSIENCE
OF LIFE,
 BIOLOGY'S AWESOME POTENTIAL
FOR INSTABILITY,
 AND THE POSSIBLE MEANINGLESSNESS
OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE,
 I DON'T THINK
IT'S WORTH THE BOTHER.
 I'M WITH ONSLOW.
 COME ALONG IN, ELIZABETH.
- THANK YOU, HYACINTH.
 WIPE YOUR FEET, DEAR.
 YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
BOTHERED TO INVITE ME
 FOR COFFEE, HYACINTH,
WHEN YOU'RE SO BUSY.
 OH, I HAVE EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.
 A WELL-REGULATED HOUSEHOLD
OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FIND TIME
 TO MAKE A CUP OF COFFEE
FOR A NEIGHBOR,
 HOWEVER GLITTERING
THE OCCASION THIS EVENING.
 DO SIT DOWN,
ELIZABETH.
 NO, NOT THERE, DEAR.
I LIKE TO FACE THE WINDOW.
 PERHAPS EMMET WOULD LIKE
TO POP IN FOR A COFFEE.
 NO THANK YOU, HYACINTH.
I THINK HE'S BUSY.
 OH, WELL THAT'S NICE.
 KEEP HIS MIND
OFF HIS DIVORCE.
 HE MUSTN'T FEEL
THAT HE'S ALONE.
 I DON'T THINK HE DOES,
HYACINTH,
 NOT SINCE
HE MET YOU.
 HOW VERY KIND.
 NOW,
 WILL YOU HAVE MY BETTER CHINA, ELIZABETH,
 IF YOU PROMISE
TO BE CAREFUL-
 OR A BEAKER?
 A BEAKER, HYACINTH,
DEFINITELY A BEAKER.
 I THINK PERHAPS
THAT'S WISE, DON'T YOU?
 WHO ELSE IS COMING THIS
EVENING? ANYONE I KNOW?
 PERHAPS?
 THE ONE WITH
THE SWIMMING POOL?
 WELL, NO ACTUALLY.
- OH, SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
 WELL, IT CAN'T
BE HELPED YOU KNOW.
 BRUCE ISN'T AT ALL WELL.
 NOTHING SERIOUS,
I HOPE.
 WELL, I THINK HE COULD
JUST DO WITH A CHANGE.
 THAT'S PROBABLY
THE TELEPHONE.
 RICHARD'LL TAKE IT.
 IT MIGHT BE SHERIDAN.
 HE LOVES TO RING ME AND TELL
ME ABOUT HIS NEW FRIENDS. MILK?
 NO, THANK YOU.
 HE'S MADE SOME VERY NICE
NEW FRIENDS. SUGAR?
 NO, THANK YOU,
HYACINTH.
 NICE FRIENDS ARE SO
IMPORTANT, AREN'T THEY?
 BISCUIT?
 NO, THANK YOU.
 AND I DON'T MEAN THE HEARTY
SPORTING CROWD EITHER.
 ALL SHERIDAN'S FRIENDS
ARE VERY ARTISTIC.
 HELLO, LIZ.
 TELEPHONE, HYACINTH,
YOUR SISTER VIOLET AGAIN.
 OH, VIOLET,
YES.
 THE ONE WITH A SWIMMING POOL
AND ROOM FOR A PONY.
 PERHAPS BRUCE IS
COMING AFTER ALL.
 HE IS NOT!
 WHAT IS IT NOW, VIOLET?
 NO, I HAVEN'T A GIRDLE
THAT MIGHT FIT BRUCE.
 I DON'T THINK
IT'S AT ALL-
 NOW, LOOK,
I RESENT THE IDEA
 THAT I'M THE ONLY ONE
YOU KNOW WHO HAS A GIRDLE.
 I WILL NOT PASS
MY DISCONTINUED GIRDLES
 ON TO BRUCE.
 WELL, IF HE'S SUDDENLY
ASHAMED OF HIS TUMMY,
 WHY DOESN'T HE
LOSE WEIGHT?
 OH, WHY DO YOU
PAMPER HIM, VIOLET-
 I MEAN, APART FROM THE MONEY
AND THE MERCEDES?
 ONSLOW.
 YO?
 DO YOU THINK THE UNIVERSE
IS MEANINGLESS?
 I MUST SAY I WAS INCLINED
TOWARDS THAT THEORY
 WHEN I SAW YOU WEARING
THAT SEE-THROUGH NIGHTIE
 OVER A VEST.
 BUT WHAT ABOUT LOVE?
 NOT RIGHT NOW, DAISE,
I'M BUSY.
 DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT?
 DON'T YOU THINK IT GIVES
LIFE A SORT OF MEANING?
 I ASSUME YOU'RE NOT
JUST TALKING ABOUT SEX.
 I'M NOT.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SEX.
 I'M TALKING ABOUT
COMPANIONSHIP, AFFECTION-
 FOR BOTH OF WHICH,
IT'S OKAY TO WEAR A VEST.
 MIND YOU,
SEX WOULD BE NICE.
 THEY'RE OFF.
 IF YOU WON'T DO IT,
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO!
 OH, I DON'T KNOW, THOUGH.
 I'LL TELL MR. HELLIWELL
TO PICK ME UP AT OUR HYACINTH'S.
 YOU CAN'T JUST GO SWANNING
ROUND TO OUR HYACINTH'S.
 WE'RE SISTERS, AREN'T WE?
- SHE WON'T LIKE IT.
 I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SEEING BORIS TONIGHT.
 OH, BORIS CAN WAIT!
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.
 I'LL GET PICKED UP
AT OUR HYACINTH'S.
 NOW, NO PEEPING.
 NOT UNTIL I TELL YOU.
 WHOOPS.
- MIND THE FURNITURE, DEAR.
 NOW!
OPEN THEM NOW!
 THE TABLE, DEAR!
- OH, THE TABLE.
 YES, HOW DOES IT LOOK?
- OH, IT LOOKS VERY NICE, HYACINTH.
 VERY NICE.
IS THAT IT?
 IS THAT THE EXTENT
OF YOUR ENTHUSIASM?
 IT LOOKS QUITE
EXCEPTIONALLY NICE.
 OH, RICHARD.
I SPEND HOURS
 ON THE AESTHETICS
OF MY TABLE.
 I WANT PEOPLE TO WALK
THROUGH THIS DOOR,
 AND STAGGER BACK
IN ADMIRATION.
 I HAD A LITTLE STAGGER. YOU MAY NOT
HAVE NOTICED IT, BUT IT WAS THERE.
 RICHARD,
I TRY TO USE YOU
 TO GAUGE OTHER
PEOPLE'S RESPONSE
 AS THEY WALK
THROUGH THAT DOOR.
 AND IF THEY DON'T DO BETTER THAN
YOU, I'VE WASTED THE AFTERNOON.
 IT'S TIMES LIKE THESE
I MISS SHERIDAN.
 I'LL COME IN AGAIN.
 I'VE GOT A REPUTATION
TO MAINTAIN, DEAR.
 I'M KNOWN
FAR AND WIDE
 FOR THE TASTEFUL
ACCESSORIES OF MY TABLE.
 I WASN'T LOOKING PROPERLY
LAST TIME.
 BUT THIS TIME,
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT.
 DO YOUR BEST, DEAR.
 OH-HO!
 OH, NEVER MIND.
I'LL GET ELIZABETH.
 SHE KNOWS HOW
TO APPRECIATE A TABLE.
 AND JUST BE CAREFUL
OF MY PAINTWORK, DEAR.
 YES, YES OF COURSE
I'LL COME ROUND, HYACINTH.
 YES, YOU WANT
TO CHECK MY REACTION.
 LIKE WE DID LAST TIME.
 AND THE TIME BEFORE.
AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT.
 NO, NO, IT'S VERY KIND
OF YOU TO VALUE MY OPINION.
 WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
- I'VE GOT TO POP ROUND AND LOOK AT HYACINTH'S TABLE.
 WHY DO YOU HAVE TO LOOK
AT HYACINTH'S TABLE?
 SHE WANTS TO CHECK
MY REACTION.
 SHE'S BEEN WORKING
ALL DAY ON HER TABLE.
 WHY DON'T YOU GO AND
TELL HER-? - EMMET!
 IT'S EASIER THIS WAY.
 EMMET, HOW DOES
THIS LOOK?
 OH, HYACINTH!
 OH, DEAR.
 DAMN.
 I'VE JUST POPPED ROUND-
- I KNOW.
 SHE'S IN THE DINING ROOM, WAITING.
- I'LL DO MY BEST.
 LIZ, MIGHT I SUGGEST
A LITTLE STAGGER?
 STAGGER?
- BACKWARDS.
 A LITTLE STAGGER
BACKWARDS. OH!
 TRUST ME.
 OH, HYACINTH!
 NO, BORIS,
 I'M NOT GOING OUT
WITH YOU THIS EVENING.
 NO, BORIS, YOU NEEDN'T
BOTHER COMING ROUND EITHER-
 I SHAN'T BE HERE.
 THERE WAS A TIME
 WHEN WE USED TO SIT
ON THE SETTEE TOGETHER,
 AND YOU USED
TO NIBBLE MY EAR.
 NOW, ALL YOU EVER
NIBBLE IS CRISPS.
 NO, BORIS...
 WEREN'T TOO MANY FLAVORS
IN THOSE DAYS.
 IF YOU MUST KNOW,
BORIS,
 I'M GOING OUT
WITH A MR. HELLIWELL...
 AND I DON'T CARE
FOR LANGUAGE LIKE THAT
 WHEN I'M WEARING
MY BEST EARRINGS.
 BE HONEST,
 SOME OF THE FIRE'S
 DEFINITELY GONE
OUT OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.
 NOTHING PERSONAL,
DAISE,
 IT'S JUST-
WOMEN GET OLDER QUICKER.
 I KNOW IT'S NOT FAIR
BUT THE FACT REMAINS
 THAT US MEN
STAY ATTRACTIVE LONGER.
 ...BECAUSE HE TREATS ME
LIKE A LADY.
 I'VE NEVER KNOWN HIM
TAKE A LIBERTY
 WITHOUT REMOVING
HIS HAT.
 NO, BORIS, IT'S NO GOOD
YOU COMING ROUND, DEAR,
 I SHAN'T BE HERE.
 I DO HOPE THAT'S NOT
ANOTHER CANCELLATION.
 YOU'D THINK PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT
TO COME TO MY CANDLELIGHT SUPPERS.
 THE "BOUQUET" RES-
 YES, I'LL ACCEPT
THE CHARGE.
 SHERIDAN,
YOU REMEMBERED.
 HOW SWEET OF YOU
TO RING
 AND WISH MOMMY EVERY SUCCESS
FOR HER SOCIAL ENTERTAINING.
 WHAT DOES HE WANT?
 WANTSANYTHING, DEAR.
 HE'S JUST RINGING HIS MOMMY
TO WISH HER ALL THE BEST FOR-
 YOU NEED A CHECK
FOR HOW MUCH, DEAR?
 ?70?
 YOU'RE NOT SPENDING IT
ON GIRLS, ARE YOU DEAR?
 YOU PROMISED MOMMY.
 WE AGREED,
NOT UNTIL AFTER YOU'D
 FINISHED
YOUR EDUCATION.
 OH, YOU AND TARQUIN
AREN'T INTERESTED IN GIRLS.
 WHAT A COMFORT THAT IS
TO A MOTHER'S HEART, DEAR.
 OH, YES OF COURSE,
DEAR.
 YOU RUN ALONG AND HELP
TARQUIN FINISH THE IRONING.
 AND DADDY WILL POP
THE CHECK INTO THE POST.
 GOODBYE.
 MUST WE GO NOW, LIZ?
COULDN'T WE DELAY IT A BIT?
 SHE SAID TO COME EARLY.
- IT'S NOT A ROYAL COMMAND.
 YOU WANT TO BET?
I FIND THE EASIEST WAY
 IS TO GO ALONG WITH THINGS
AND GET THEM OVER QUICKLY.
 COME ON.
 SHE'LL SING AT ME.
- SHE'LL BE ENTERTAINING,
 HOW CAN SHE
SING AT YOU?
 SHE'LL FIND A WAY.
I KNOW SHE WILL.
 SHE'LL SING AT ME.
 I WANT EMMET
TO HAVE A LITTLE TASTE
 OF MY
MUSICAL TALENTS.
 YOU WILL
BRING THEM IN HERE
 WHERE I SHALL BE DISCOVERED
AT THE PIANOFORTE.
 NOW I'M RELYING ON YOU,
RICHARD, TO LISTEN FOR THE BELL.
 I'LL LISTEN, HYACINTH,
WITH EVERY NERVE AQUIVER.
 GOOD.
 AND DON'T
FORGET THE ICE.
 OH, THE ICE.
- THE ICE.
 THERE'S THE BELL.
 * FOR TONIGHT *
 * LET ME DREAM OF
MY DREAM OF DELIGHT *
 * TRA LA LA
TRA LA LA LA LA *
 * LA LA LA LA *
 * AND PURCHASE OF SOUL *
 * A MOMENT'S RESPITE *
 * OH! *
 WHAT IS IT, RICHARD?
- THERE'S SOMEONE AT THE DOOR.
 IT'S YOUR SISTER, ROSE.
 HELLO, HYACINTH.
 ROSE, DEAR,
HOW NICE TO SEE YOU.
 RICHARD,
THE ICE, DEAR.
 I'M NOT STOPPING.
 I'M JUST BEING PICKED UP
HERE BY MR. HELLIWELL.
 COME ON.
 RICHARD, OUR GUESTS
HAVE ARRIVED!
 ARE YOU
EXPECTING COMPANY?
 IT'S JUST ELIZABETH
FROM NEXT DOOR
 AND HER BROTHER EMMET.
 OH, I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE HAD A BROTHER.
 YES, HE'S RECOVERING
FROM RATHER A BAD DIVORCE.
 OH, DIVORCED IS HE?
 HELLO, HYACINTH.
 OH, I AM-
 OH, I CAN SEE
HE'S SUFFERED.
 SOME WOMEN
CAN BE BITCHES.
 RICHARD, HAVE YOU
CRUSHED THE ICE, DEAR?
 NOT REALLY.
- HURRY UP, DEAR.
 WE'LL NEED IT FOR OUR
FRAPPE!E MINT JULEP.
 RICHARD, ANSWER THAT,
WILL YOU?!
 ARE YOU HELLIWELL?
- WHAT'S IT TO YOU?
 ROSE IS MY BIRD!
- THAT'S A MATTER OF OPINION.
 ROSE IS MINE.
- ROSE BELONGS TO ME!
 WHERE IS SHE?
- ROSE, TELL HIM I'M YOURS!
 IT'S FOR ROSE.
 ROSE, COME OUT HERE!
 GET RID OF THEM, RICHARD!
- I'M NOT GOING OUT THERE!
 HAVE YOU SEEN THE SIZE OF THEM?
- OH, IT'S JUST MUSCLE.
 THEY MUST LEAVE AT ONCE.
- DON'T WORRY, I'LL GET RID OF THEM.
 I'VE GONE OFF BOTH
OF THEM, ANYWAY.
 I'M GOING TO STAY HERE
AND HAVE SUPPER WITH EMMET.
 IS RECOVERING
 FROM A PAINFUL
DIVORCE, ROSE.
 HE NEEDS ALL THE HELP
HE CAN GET THEN, DOESN'T HE?
 EXCUSE ME, RICHARD.
 TELL HIM WHAT?
 IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
HYACINTH?
 OH, YES.
 EVERYTHING'S FINE.
YES.
 FRESHEN EMMET'S DRINK,
WILL YOU, RICHARD?
 I HAVEN'T
HAD ONE, YET.
 WHAT DID HE SAY?
- HE SAID HE HASN'T HAD ONE YET.
 OH, THAT'S GOOD.
YES.
 ELIZABETH, HOW'S YOUR DAUGHTER
DOING WITH HER STUDYING?!
 QUITE WELL,
THANK YOU!
 DID YOU HEAR THAT?
- I EXPECT EVERYBODY-
 EVERYBODY HEARD.
 DON'T SHOUT,
DEAR.
 I'M SO GLAD THAT SHE IS-
- Boris: TAKE THAT!
 OOH, BORIS!
 IT WILL BE SO NICE
FOR SHERIDAN
 TO HAVE SOMEBODY
INTELLIGENT TO TALK TO
 WHEN HE COMES HOME!
 OOH!
- OW!
 YOU KNOW, I DO BELIEVE
I FEEL A SONG COMING ON.
 A SONG!
 EMMET, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND,
WON'T YOU, DEAR?
 WHEN THE MOON DICTATES
 WHAT WOULD ONE DO
 BUT JUST ANSWER
THE HEART AND SING?!
 SING-SING. SING.
 * ROSE OF ENGLAND,
THOU SHALT FADE- *
 I THINK I WILL HAVE
