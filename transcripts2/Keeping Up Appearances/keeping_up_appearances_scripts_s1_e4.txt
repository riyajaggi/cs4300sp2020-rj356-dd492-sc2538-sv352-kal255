 Keeping Up Appearances (1990â€“1995): Season 1, Episode 4 - The Charity Shop - full transcript 
 Hyacinth's ambition for Richard includes grooming him in such crucial matters as wearing a bow-tie, while she networks by volunteering herself and Elisabeth to work a day in nastily haughty Councillor Nugent's charity shop, but when Daisy calls daddy has a woman, Hyacinth goes to great lengths -literally, actually most conspicuously- to avoid even Liz knowing how poor that family branch lives. Alas the woman claims she was the one taken advantage of, and her son is unwilling to come and get her even when tracked down, until exposed to man-eater Rose ...

 IS THAT FOR ME?
 IT SAYS BUCKET
ON THE ENVELOPE.
 IT'S "BOUQUET."
B-U-C-K-E-T. "BOU-QUET."
 THE ACCENT
ON THE SECOND SYLLABLE.
 WELL, IT'S FOR
THIS ADDRESS, ANYWAY.
 WHAT'S WRONG NOW?
- I NEVER LIKE TO HANDLE THESE THINGS TOO FREELY
 UNTIL I HAVE SOME IDEA
WHO IT'S FROM.
 BUT DOES IT MATTER?
- IT MATTERS ENORMOUSLY.
 SOME TOTAL STRANGER MAY HAVE LICKED
THIS ENVELOPE, NOT TO MENTION THE STAMP.
 THERE MAY BE SOME PREPARED
TO GAMBLE WITH THEIR HEALTH,
 BUT I THINK A CERTAIN RESERVE
IS CALLED FOR
 AGAINST THE TONGUES
OF STRANGERS.
 IS THIS ALL?
 ARE YOU SURE THERE ISN'T
A LETTER FROM MY SON?
 NOTHING ELSE.
- BUT HE'S ALWAYS WRITING TO HIS MOTHER,
 AS WELL AS RINGING ME
REGULARLY.
 SHERIDAN IS EXTREMELY
THOUGHTFUL.
 MAYBE HE'S TRYING TELEPATHY.
 IF THAT'S AN EXAMPLE
OF POST OFFICE HUMOR,
 THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO KEEP
PUTTING THEIR CHARGES UP!
 OH, JUST OFF, DEAR?
 YOU KNOW, I WONDER
SOMETIMES ABOUT A BOW-TIE.
 WOULDN'T SUIT YOU.
 FOR YOU, DEAR.
 I NEVER WEAR BOW-TIES.
 WELL, YOU SHOULD. YOU'RE STILL
ONLY THE DEPUTY IN YOUR DEPARTMENT.
 PERHAPS IF YOU WORE A BOW-TIE,
YOU'D BE THE CHIEF.
 I DON'T THINK THE PROMOTIONS
SYSTEM IS BASED ON BOW-TIES.
 YOU'RE TOO NAIVE, RICHARD.
THESE THINGS MATTER.
 YOU'D STAND OUT MORE
IN A BOW-TIE.
 ESPECIALLY ONE THAT SPINS
AROUND AND LIGHTS UP.
 NOW DON'T BE SILLY.
 YOU SHOULD DO IT FOR ME
AND FOR SHERIDAN.
 SHERIDAN DESERVES A FATHER FULL OF
EXECUTIVE STRESS-WEARING A BOW-TIE.
 AND WHERE'S YOUR BRIEFCASE?
 I HAVE NOTHING TO CARRY.
 THAT DOESN'T MATTER.
 YOU SHOULD ALWAYS LOOK AS IF
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO CARRY.
 HYACINTH...
- THEY ALWAYS PROMOTE PEOPLE
 WHO LOOK AS IF THEY HAVE
SOMETHING TO CARRY.
 RICHARD.
 WHAT NOW?
 HAVEN'T YOU FORGOTTEN
SOMETHING, DEAR?
 SEE YOU THIS EVENING.
 MORNING, LIZ.
 OH, GOOD MORNING, RICHARD!
 GOOD MORNING, ELIZABETH.
 MORNING, HYACINTH.
 CAN YOU SEE HIM
IN A BOW-TIE?
 WELL, NOT FROM BEHIND.
 HE'S THINKING
OF WEARING ONE.
 HE WANTS TO LOOK MORE
AGGRESSIVELY MANAGERIAL.
 IT WON'T SUIT HIM,
DO YOU THINK?
 DON'T ASK ME.
I HATE MAKING DECISIONS.
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO, DO YOU?
YOU LIVE NEXT DOOR TO ME.
 BE READY AT 9:30.
- FOR WHAT?
 FOR THE CHARITY SHOP.
 IT'S OUR DAY
FOR THE CHARITY SHOP.
 OH MY GOODNESS.
I'D FORGOTTEN THE CHARITY SHOP.
 BEST FOOT FORWARD.
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT DAY.
 WE SHALL BE SERVING
WITH MRS. NUGENT.
 COUNCILORNUGENT.
 ONSLOW.
 ONSLOW.
 THERE'S A WOMAN
IN DAD'S BEDROOM.
 DON'T TELL ME.
 HE'S AWAKE.
HE BROUGHT HER IN.
 SHE WASN'T THERE
LAST NIGHT.
 HE MUST HAVE SNEAKED OUT AGAIN
WHILE WE WERE IN BED.
 WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO ABOUT IT?
 I'M JUST CONSULTING YOU.
 I THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT HUSBANDS ARE FOR.
 YOU'RE GOING TO BE SORRY
ONE OF THESE DAYS
 WHEN YOU'VE OVERLOADING ME
WITH RESPONSIBILITY.
 SHE SAYS SHE'S HIS FIANCE!E.
 OH, WELL, THAT'S
ALL RIGHT THEN.
 CLOSE THE DOOR
ON YOUR WAY OUT.
 OUR HYACINTH IS GOING
TO GO MAD.
 YOU HAVE NOT BROUGHT
THE CAR AROUND YET.
 OH, THE TELEPHONE.
 IT'S PROBABLY SHERIDAN.
 HE'S ALWAYS SO THOUGHTFUL,
 SO CONSIDERATE OF HIS MOTHER.
 COMING, SHERIDAN.
 I'LL BRING THE CAR.
 SHERIDAN!
 OH, IT'S YOU, DAISY.
 I WAS EXPECTING SHERIDAN.
HE RINGS ME INCESSANTLY.
 DADDY?
 DADDY'S MOVED WHAT
INTO HIS ROOM?
 JUST STAY THERE,
I'M COMING.
 THAT WAS MY SISTER
DAISY.
 DADDY'S DEVELOPED
A LITTLE PROBLEM.
 I'M SORRY.
 I PROMISED HER
I'D CALL ON OUR WAY.
 OH, YES, OF COURSE.
 IS IT SOMETHING
HE PICKED UP?
 I'M AFRAID IT SOUNDS
VERY MUCH LIKE IT.
 I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN YOUR
SISTER DAISY'S HOUSE, HAVE I, HYACINTH?
 NO!
 NO, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE.
 IS IT A NICE HOUSE?
 WELL, I'D REALLY RATHER
 WE WERE GOING
TO MY SISTER VIOLET'S.
 YOU REMEMBER VIOLET? SHE
MARRIED THAT TURF ACCOUNTANT.
 HE BUILT THAT BIG HOUSE WITH
A SAUNA AND ROOM FOR A PONY.
 YOU'VE HEARD ME SPEAK
OF VIOLET?
 FREQUENTLY.
 YOU'D LIKE VIOLET'S.
- MAYBE I'LL LIKE DAISY'S.
 WELL, POSSIBLY YOU MAY,
Y-Y-YOU WELL MAY.
 WHAT KIND OF A HOUSE
IS DAISY'S?
 ACTUALLY-
 IT'S QUITE LIKE
ONE OF THESE.
 YES. IN FACT, IT'S VERY LIKE ONE OF THESE.
 COME TO THINK OF IT,
IT IS ONE OF THESE.
 YES, HERE IT IS.
 NOW, YOU STAY THERE.
 AND DON'T MOVE.
- OH, ALL RIGHT.
 I WON'T INVITE YOU IN, IN CASE
DADDY'S CONTRACTED SOMETHING UNSIGHTLY.
 GIVE MY REGARDS TO DAISY.
 HMM? OH, I WILL!
 YES, THANK YOU.
 I WILL.
 EXCUSE ME.
 I DIDN'T HEAR A CAR.
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?
 MY NEIGHBOR ELIZABETH
GAVE ME A LIFT.
 WELL, LET'S BRING HER IN!
- NO, NO!
 SHE SENDS HER REGARDS.
 I DIDN'T SEE A CAR.
 SHE'S JUST AROUND
THE CORNER... WAITING.
 MORNING, HYACINTH.
COME FOR THE WEDDING?
 WHY IS IT ONE ALWAYS SEES
SO MUCH OF ONSLOW?
 DOES HE NEVER
COVER HIMSELF ENTIRELY?
 HE LIKES TO KEEP
HIS ARMS FREE.
 WHY? HE NEVER DOES
MUCH WITH THEM.
 I WONDER WHERE THEY'RE GOING
FOR THEIR HONEYMOON.
 IT'S NOT FUNNY, ONSLOW.
- IT'S NOT BAD FOR STARTERS.
 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SIT
THERE WATCHING TELEVISION
 WHEN DADDY IS THE VICTIM
OF A CUNNING PLOT.
 WHO IS THIS
UNSCRUPULOUS FEMALE?
 I'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE FOUND HER.
 POOR DADDY.
 WHEN HE SHOULD BE ENJOYING
HIS DECLINING YEARS.
 I THINK HE IS ENJOYING
HIS DECLINING YEARS.
 IN HIS BEDROOM.
 YOU HAVEN'T LET HER
INTO DADDY'S BEDROOM?
 SHE'S JUST SITTING THERE
IN A CHAIR.
 HE'S FAST ASLEEP.
- IT'S GOOD, THIS.
 WE MUST GET RID OF HER.
- SHE WON'T GO.
 HAVE YOU SPOKEN
TO HER FIRMLY?
 I TRIED THAT.
 I EVEN USED THE ULTIMATE
THREAT. I SENT ONSLOW.
 "WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME?"
I SAID.
 "BUG OFF," SHE SAID.
 WE'VE GOT TO GET HER OUT
OF DADDY'S BEDROOM
 BEFORE IT RADICALLY AFFECTS
HIS PENSIONABLE STATUS.
 SHH.
 WHAT'S GOING ON?
 NOTHING.
 SHE'S JUST SITTING THERE
WITHOUT MOVING.
 FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT
IT WAS ONSLOW.
 IT'S REMARKS LIKE THAT
THAT OUGHTA COOL
 THE FIRST FURIOUS FIRES
OF OUR MARRIAGE.
 DON'T START ARGUING.
WHAT'S DADDY DOING?
 HE'S STILL ASLEEP.
 THERE'S THE ANSWER.
 SHE FORCED HERSELF ON HIM
WHILE HE WAS STILL ASLEEP.
 POOR DADDY.
 I AM HIS OLDEST DAUGHTER.
 I HAVE BEEN CONSULTED
IN THIS MATTER,
 AND IT HAS BEEN DECIDED
THAT YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.
 HE OFFERED ME MARRIAGE.
 DADDY HAS NOT BEEN WELL.
- I'VE GOT WITNESSES.
 DADDY IS SOMETIMES
NOT ALTOGETHER LOGICAL.
 HE OFFERED ME MARRIAGE.
 LOOK, YOU CANNOT TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF AN AILING OLD MAN.
 HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME.
 HOW?!
- WHEN?!
 NEVER MIND.
 I GOT WITNESSES.
 I THINK YOU MUST
HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD HIM.
 OH, I UNDERSTOOD HIM.
 HE OFFERED ME MARRIAGE.
 HAVEN'T YOU GOT
A HOME TO GO TO?
 CERTAINLY.
 IT'S HERE.
 WE'RE GOING TO NEED
A BIGGER TEAPOT.
 YOU'LL NEED NOTHING
OF THE KIND.
 THIS LADY IS GOING.
 I CAN'T JUST LEAVE HIM.
 I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF BASIS
IS THAT FOR A MARRIAGE?
 HE'LL PROBABLY HAVE FORGOTTEN
ALL ABOUT YOU WHEN HE WAKES UP.
 HE'LL WANT TO PLAY
WITH HIS TRAINS.
 TRAINS!
 OH, I LIKE TRAINS!
 I CAN PLAY
WITH TRAINS!
 WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?
WON'T THEY BE MISSING YOU?
 I'VE ONLY GOT A SON.
- AH, A SON.
 I HAVE A SON, TOO.
 YOU CAN'T DESERT HIM.
THEY NEED US.
 HE'S 45 YEARS OLD.
 A VERY TRICKY AGE.
 I HAVE TO GO.
ELIZABETH IS WAITING.
 AND MRS. COUNCILOR NUGENT.
 IT'S MY DAY
FOR THE CHARITY SHOP.
 WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
WITH THE WOMAN?
 SHE COULD MAKE IT
FOUR FOR BRAGG.
 I'VE GOT THE SON'S ADDRESS.
 I SHALL CALL AND MAKE SURE
HE FETCHES HER HOME.
 NOW, I MUST GO.
 SHE'S A REAL ORGANIZER,
OUR HYACINTH.
 SHE'S A REAL-
- ONSLOW.
 I'M SORRY
TO KEEP YOU WAITING.
 WAS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
 HMM?
- HOW WAS YOUR FATHER?
 REMARKABLY RELAXED.
 JUST TURN LEFT HERE.
 I HAVE A CALL TO MAKE.
- HERE?!
 THIS IS THE ADDRESS.
 MY CHARITABLE DUTIES
BRING ME HERE.
 SOMEONE YOU KNOW?
- NO, NO, NO.
 A TOTAL STRANGER.
 MR. DUXBURY?
 DUXBURY?
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.
 HAVE YOU HEARD OF A DUXBURY?
- NOT AROUND HERE.
 HE'S NEVER HEARD
OF HIM EITHER.
 YOU SHOULDN'T BE
ASKING US ANYWAY,
 WE JUST HAPPEN
TO BE HERE DELIVERING
 THESE BOXES OF WASTE-PAPER
FOR RECYCLING.
 BUT I GOT THIS ADDRESS
FROM HIS MOTHER.
 MOTHER? SHE'S GONE OFF
TO BE MARRIED.
 NO, SHE HASN'T!
- SHE RANG ME THIS MORN-
 SO YOU ARE THE SON.
- YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.
 YOU FORGET THINGS.
 WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU?
 YOU CAN GO AND GET HER BACK,
THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN DO.
 BACK? BACK? I'VE ONLY JUST GOT RID OF HER.
 YOU'LL FIND HER
AT THIS ADDRESS.
 I EXPECT HER TO BE GONE WITHIN THE HOUR.
 YOU CAN'T COME BETWEEN
TWO LOVERS.
 SHE'S TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF A SENILE GENTLEMAN.
 IT'S JUST WHAT SHE NEEDS.
THEY'D BE GREAT TOGETHER.
 WITHIN THE HOUR.
 MRS. COUNCILOR NUGENT,
SO SORRY WE'RE LATE.
 JUST A LITTLE FAMILY
HICCUP.
 THIS IS MY NEIGHBOR,
MRS. ELIZABETH WARDEN.
 YOU'LL REMEMBER ELIZABETH.
 SHE'S ALMOST ALWAYS
AT MY CANDLELIGHT SUPPERS.
 I HAVE NO TIME
FOR SOCIALIZING.
 NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S QUITE TRUE.
 MRS. COUNCILOR NUGENT IS FAMOUS FOR
HER DEDICATION TO SOCIAL SERVICE.
 THAT'S NICE.
 I HAVE TO TRY AND BRING A LITTLE
HAPPINESS TO PEOPLE'S LIVES.
 NOT TOO MUCH MIND YOU, OR ELSE THEY
START TAKING THINGS FOR GRANTED,
 NEVER KNOW WHEN TO STOP.
 NEXT THING YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
BEHAVING IN A DISGUSTING MANNER,
 ENJOYING EXCESSIVE
ROMANTIC BEHAVIOR.
 MRS. COUNCILOR NUGENT
IS A FORCE IN THE COMMUNITY
 DEDICATED TO THE SUPPRESSION
OF EXCESSIVE ROMANTIC BEHAVIOR.
 REALLY?
- I WON'T HAVE IT.
 THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN BEING
ALL DOLLED UP FOR THE OPPOSITE SEX.
 SEX, YES!
I DO SO AGREE.
 I'VE ALWAYS WARNED
MY SHERIDAN AGAINST FEMALES
 WHO FLAUNT THEMSELVES
AT THE OPPOSITE SEX.
 IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'LL JUST
GO AND CHECK OUR WINDOW DISPLAY.
 HYACINTH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- JUST KEEP WALKING, ROSE.
 WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T BEND DOWN.
 I FORBID YOU EVER
TO BEND DOWN IN THIS VICINITY.
 I BROUGHT SOME CLOTHING
FOR THE SHOP.
 THAT'S SO KIND OF YOU.
 IT'S MUCH APPRECIATED.
- LET ME TAKE IT.
 BUT WHY CAN'T
I TAKE IT IN FOR YOU?
 ALL RIGHT, TAKE IT IN.
I DON'T CARE.
 I DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYTHING.
 I FIND LIFE VERY BLEAK
IN THE ABSENCE
 OF A VERY SPECIAL
MR. BLANKENSOP.
 I THOUGHT IT WAS
A MR. HEPPLEWHITE?
 DON'T YOU MENTION
THAT CREEP TO ME.
 HE WAS SHALLOW.
 YOU WERE GOING
TO COMMIT SUICIDE OVER HIM.
 BUT THAT WAS BEFORE
I FOUND OUT HE WAS SHALLOW.
 AND THAT WAS BEFORE
I MET THE REAL THING.
 I REMEMBER YOU THREATENED
TO COMMIT SUICIDE
 OVER A MR. HEPPLEWHITE.
 YOU WANTED MOMMY'S WEDDING
DRESS TO BE BURIED IN.
 IT WOULDN'T
HAVE FITTED ME ANYWAY.
 I WOULD HAVE LOOKED
DREADFUL.
 AND NOW IT'S
A MR. BLANKENSOP.
 YES.
 I WARN YOU
- YOU'RE STILL NOT HAVING MOMMY'S WEDDING DRESS.
 WHO ASKED YOU FOR IT?
 OH, DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT
GOING TO DO ANYTHING STUPID.
 I'M FINISHED WITH MEN.
 I WISH YOU MEANT IT.
 I DO MEAN IT.
 THEY'RE NOTHING
BUT HEARTACHE AND TROUBLE.
 I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
 I CAN NEVER GET RICHARD
TO FOLD HIS PAJAMAS.
 THEY'RE NOT WORTH IT.
 I'M DETERMINED-
 I'M GOING TO SPEND
MY LIFE ALONE.
 I THINK THAT'S
VERY WISE,
 BUT YOU'LL NEED
A LONGER SKIRT.
 NOT MEN.
 I'VE GIVEN UP
WORRYING ABOUT MEN.
 THAT'S WHAT'S IN
THE BAG.
 ALL MY BEST CLOTHES.
 THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU.
 NO, LET ME TAKE IT IN
FOR YOU.
 I'M SURE THERE'S SOME POOR
SOUL WHO'LL APPRECIATE IT.
 NOW, RUN ALONG HOME
 AND TELL THEM I'LL FIND
SOME WAY OF SAVING DADDY
 FROM A FATE WORSE
THAN SENILITY.
 ROSE.
 COME HERE.
 THERE'S TOO MUCH INTEREST
IN THE OPPOSITE SEX.
 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF IT
THAT GOES ON.
 I MUST SAY, I'VE NEVER FELT
OVERWHELMED BY IT.
 JUST A LITTLE CHARITABLE GIFT
FROM A WELL-WISHER.
 OUR FOREFATHERS MANAGED. THEY PRACTICALLY
WENT THROUGH THEIR ENTIRE LIVES
 WITHOUT ANY INTEREST
IN THE OPPOSITE SEX.
 THEY MAY NOT HAVE
BROADCAST IT.
 THEY LIVED PLAINLY. THAT'S THE SECRET OF LIFE
- LIVING PLAINLY.
 NO FRILLS OR FRIPPERY.
 FINANCE
AND GENERAL PURPOSES.
 OH, HYACINTH.
 YOU SOUND UPSET.
 I HAVE TO SAVE
YOUR FATHER FROM WHAT?
 MARRIAGE?!
 AT HIS AGE?
IN HIS CONDITION?
 WON'T IT INTERFERE
WITH THE MEDICATION?
 I CAN'T DROP
EVERYTHING AND GO.
 ALL RIGHT!
 CANDROP EVERYTHING AND GO.
 I'LL USE MY LUNCHTIME.
 HE CAN'T BE MARRIED
BEFORE LUNCHTIME.
 SHE WANTS TO STAY.
 WE HAVEN'T GOT
A BIG ENOUGH TEAPOT.
 I THINK YOU SHOULD
RECONSIDER.
 TAKE HER HOME.
- I CAN'T TAKE HER BACK NOW.
 SHE'S JUST FOUND HAPPINESS.
 IT BREAKS YOUR HEART,
DOESN'T IT?
 WE DON'T WANT HER.
 THEY'RE IN LOVE.
 HE'S STILL ASLEEP.
 I'VE GOT WITNESSES.
 I CAN'T COME BETWEEN
A MAN AND HIS FIANCE!E.
 WELL, IT IS.
 AND SHE WANTS
TO STAY.
 THEY CAN WRITE.
- SHE'S GOT WITNESSES.
 I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU DRAGGED ME INTO THIS.
 LET HER BE HAPPY
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
 I DEMAND YOU BE FIRM.
 LET'S FACE IT,
YOU'RE FIRMER THAN ME.
 I"?
 Onslow: HE'S AN OLD MAN.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
 DAD'S BEEN ACCUSED
OF BEING ENGAGED.
 SHE'S GOT WITNESSES.
- THIS IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.
 WE SHALL TAKE
LEGAL ADVICE.
 WHAT'S IT GOT TO DO WITH YOU?
- SHE'S MY SISTER-IN-LAW.
 HARD LUCK.
MOTHER KNOWS HER RIGHTS.
 IS THIS YOUR MOTHER?
- YEAH.
 BROKENHEARTED.
- I CAN SEE THE RESEMBLANCE.
 YOU'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME
POWERFUL PROFILE.
 LET'S NOT
STAND OUT HERE
 FOR THE BENEFIT
OF THE NEIGHBORS.
 LET'S GO INSIDE.
 TO THINK THAT I
SHOULD FALL TO THIS
 FROM THE PEAK OF MY
CANDLELIGHT SUPPERS.
 I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE.
 THEN LET ME MAKE YOU
A CUP OF TEA.
 NOT IN THAT KITCHEN.
 WHAT'S THE MATTER?
 IT'S MRS. COUNCILOR NUGENT.
 I HOPE SHE DIDN'T SEE ME.
 BETTER LET ME ANSWER
THE DOOR.
 NO. WE CAN'T LET WORD GET
THROUGH TO THE COUNCIL CHAMBER
 THAT YOU'VE EVEN BEEN
SEEN AT THIS AREA.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?
 I AM A FOREIGNER
IN YOUR COUNTRY.
 I WANT TO RETURN THIS LOAD
OF SHAMELESS SEE-THROUGH,
 EX-CERTIFICATE
UP-TO-NO-GOOD UNDERWEAR
 THAT WAS LEFT IN ERROR
AT THE CHARITY SHOP!
 IS THE RIGHT ADDRESS,
 IN THE BAG.
 GET ROSE. FETCH ROSE.
THEY'RE HER UNDIES.
 WHY NOT PLEASE TO PUSH THEM
THROUGH THE LETTER BOX?
 THE KEYHOLE!
 IT'S MRS. NUGENT. SHE'S BROUGHT YOUR
- UNDERTHINGS BACK.
 OH, GOODIE.
 I NEVER THOUGHT I'D NEED THEM
IN THE ABSENCE OF MR. BLANKENSOP.
 LOOK, I'VE GOT
TO BE GOING NOW.
 YOU GET RID OF
MRS. COUNCILOR NUGENT.
 WAIT HERE.
 AND IF SHE ASKS AFTER ME,
I AM NOT HERE,
 I HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE,
AND BESIDES WHICH,
 I'M OF FOREIGN EXTRACTION.
 RICHARD!
 IS IT ALWAYS A MADHOUSE
AROUND HERE?
 WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
 I BELIEVE YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING FOR ME.
 THESE ARE NOT THE KIND
OF GARMENTS WE FEEL
 COMFORTABLE WITH
AT THE CHARITY SHOP.
 AND THAT'S YOURS TOO!
 SHE'S RIGHT.
 CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME.
 AND THIS PRACTICALLY
WILL BE YOUR HOME
 IF YOUR MOTHER STAYS
WITH MY FATHER.
 MOTHER, ARE YOU COMING?
 MOTHER.
 I COMMAND YOU, MOTHER.
WE'RE LEAVING, NOW!
 Daisy: I WONDER IF DAD WILL MISS HER.
 Onslow: HE'LL HAVE FORGOTTEN
SHE'S EVER BEEN HERE.
 I HOPE SO.
 I'D HATE DAD TO THINK
WE'D BROKE ANYTHING UP.
 YOU'RE A SOFTIE.
 WHY DO THEY HAVE
TO EMBRACE IN THE STREET?
 IT'S THEIR STREET.
 AT LEAST MAKE HIM
PUT HIS SHIRT ON.
 WE MUST BE GOING.
 ALL MY UNDIES BACK
FOR NO PURPOSE.
 I WONDER OF I OUGHT
TO RING MR. BLANKENSOP.
 I REALLY MUST GET BACK
TO THE OFFICE.
 AND I TO
THE CHARITY SHOP-
 WHERE SHIRTS ARE AVAILABLE
AT GIVE-AWAY PRICES.
 OH, YOU CAN GIVE US
A LIFT THEN.
