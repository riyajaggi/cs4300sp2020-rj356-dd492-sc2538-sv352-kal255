 ONSLOW? WHAT? WHY DON'T YOU  GROW A MUSTACHE? YOU WANT  A MUSTACHE? WHY DON'T YOU GROW A MUSTACHE? I'D JUST LIKE  SOME LITTLE SIGN YOU WERE TRYING TO EXERT SOME ATTRACTION OVER ME, ONSLOW. A WOMAN LIKES TO BE WOOED. SHE SHOULD LIVE IN AN ATMOSPHERE THAT CRACKLES WITH SEXUAL TENSION. - ( phone rings )  - OH. THE "BOUQUET"  RESIDENCE, THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SPEAKING. OH, MRS.

I BELIEVE YOU CAUGHT HIM  ONCE IN CHURCH. OH! I THINK OUR ROSE IS HOME. ( pounding on stairs ) IT MUST BE TIME TO GET UP. HOW CAN YOU LIE THERE WHEN I'VE BEEN BETRAYED AND ABANDONED?

COULDN'T I JUST SAY, "GOOD MORNING, MRS. FORTESCUE," AND WEAR A LARGE LABEL SAYING, "POWERFUL IN LOCAL AUTHORITY CIRCLES"? I DON'T THINK  THAT'S VERY AMUSING, DEAR. I HOPE YOU'RE NOT  GOING TO SPOIL THINGS  WITH LOWER-MIDDLE-CLASS HUMOR. NOW CONVERSATION. WHAT DO YOU USUALLY  TALK ABOUT IN THE CAR? I THINK YOU'LL FIND  THAT USUALLY YOU TALK  AND I LISTEN. THEN LET'S NOT TAMPER  WITH A WINNING SYSTEM. WHAT ON EARTH  IS HYACINTH DOING? YOU COULD POP OUTSIDE  AND FIND OUT. I DARE'NT GO OUT THERE. THE MINUTE SHE SETS EYES ON ME  SHE BEGINS TO SING. I THINK SHE'S AFTER A PART  IN YOUR AMATEUR OPERATIC GROUP. APART, THEPART. THAT'S TRUE. WHAT THE DEVIL  IS SHE DOING? CLOSE THE DOOR. NOW COME TO THE FRONT DOOR. NO, NO, NO, DEAR. SHOULDERS BACK, HEAD HIGH.  NO, DON'T BE SILLY, DEAR. THAT'S A BIT  BETTER, YES. IN CASE  ANYBODY'S WATCHING. THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME.  SOMEBODY MIGHT BE WATCHING. I DON'T MEAN HERE.  I MEAN AT MRS. FORTESCUE'S. - OH.  - SHE MIGHT BE PEERING  THROUGH HER WINDOW WAITING FOR US  TO ARRIVE. SO I'M AT THE DOOR, NOW WHAT? RING THE BELL. OH, GO ON,  RING THE BELL. ( bell rings ) OH, NO, NOT LIKE THAT,  RICHARD. THAT WAS ALMOST  A TRADESMAN'S RING. KEEP THE INDEX  FINGER STRAIGHT. ( bell rings ) FOR MY SAKE, RICHARD,  PLEASE PRACTICE YOUR RING. IT SHOULD BE FIRM  BUT FRIENDLY. NOW LET'S  MOVE ALONG. YOU WILL TAKE  MRS. FORTESCUE GENTLY  BY THE ELBOW... OH. AND ESCORT HER  TO THE CAR. TAKING CARE TO AVOID  HER WALKING STICK.

I TOLD YOU. * BEHOLD... * ( phone rings ) THE "BOUQUET" RESIDENCE,  THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SPEAKING. OH, IT'S YOU, VIOLET. IT'S VIOLET.  MAKE MY EXCUSES  TO ELIZABETH AND EMMET. TELL THEM IT'S MY WEALTHY SISTER, THE ONE WHO MARRIED  THE TURF ACCOUNTANT-- LARGE HOUSE, SWIMMING POOL, ROOM FOR A PONY. NOW, VIOLET, I HAVEN'T GOT  LONG TO CHAT, DEAR. I'M GOING INTO TOWN WITH THE RELATIVE  OF A BARONET. SHE DOES RATHER RELY ON ME, YES. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR HUSBAND, DEAR? WHIMS AND FANCIES.  ( chuckles ) THEY ALL HAVE THEIR WHIMS AND FANCIES. IN WHAT WAY  IS BRUCE GOING STRANGE? ( laughs ) I'M SORRY, VIOLET, BUT I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THERE YOU SAID HE WANTED YOU BOTH TO DRESS UP AS ROBIN HOOD AND MAID MARION. YES.  ( chuckles ) OH, HE DOES WANT YOU BOTH  TO DRESS UP LIKE ROBIN HOOD AND MAID MARION. WHAT DO YOU MEAN I HAVEN'T  HEARD THE WORST PART? HE WANTS TO BE  MAID MARION. - Hyacinth: WE TURN LEFT HERE. - I KNOW WE TURN LEFT HERE. WELL, ARE YOU IN THE RIGHT GEAR, DEAR? WHICH WOULD  YOU PREFER? WATCH THE CYCLIST. I'M WATCHING  THE CYCLIST. SHE SHOULDN'T BE  RIDING A BICYCLE WEARING SKIRTS  AS SHORT AS THAT. KEEP YOUR EYES  ON THE ROAD, DEAR. BUT YOU JUST TOLD ME TO WATCH THE CYCLIST. JUST WATCH  THE ROAD, DEAR. WHAT DID VIOLET HAVE TO SAY THAT'S PUT YOU IN SUCH A MOOD? - WHAT?  - YOUR SISTER ON THE PHONE? WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? ( sighs )  IT'S BRUCE. HE'S GOING OFF AGAIN. OH, WHERE TO THIS TIME, TENERIFE? SHERWOOD FOREST  BY THE SOUND OF IT. WATCH THE ROAD, DEAR. WHY SHERWOOD FOREST? HE WANTS HER  TO PLAY ROBIN HOOD. HE'S STILL TAKING THE TABLETS, IS HE? I THINK SO. PROPERTY. HER LATE HUSBAND  WAS EXTREMELY FORTUNATE  IN BUSINESS. DON'T FORGET  TO COMPLIMENT HER  ON HER SHRUBBERY. I'LL BE AS NICE  AS YOU LIKE, AS LONG AS SHE DOESN'T  ATTACK ME WITH THAT STICK. IT'S UP TO YOU  TO KEEP AN EYE  ON THE WALKING STICK. - SHE IS AN OLD LADY.  - SHE'S A DAMNED   AGILE OLD LADY. PERHAPS I SHOULD STAY IN THE CAR. NO, NO, PERHAPS I SHOULD  MEET HER AT THE DOOR. THEN AGAIN I DON'T  WANT TO LOOK TOO EAGER. STAY IN THE CAR. NO, NO, NO! I THINK THE BEST THING  IS FOR YOU TO RING THE BELL AND WHEN SHE ANSWERS THE DOOR SHE'LL FIND ME  ADMIRING HER GARDEN. A SUBTLE COMPLIMENT  WITHOUT GOING TOO FAR. IS YOUR TIE  ALL RIGHT? - NOW SHOW ME A SMILE.  - WHAT? YOUR SMILE. SHOW ME THE SMILE  WITH WHICH YOU WILL  GREET HER AT THE DOOR. OH, GOOD GRIEF,  HYACINTH. NOW DON'T BE  OBSTRUCTIONIST.  SHOW ME YOUR SMILE. YOU'LL HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT. SOMETIMES I CAN  UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE  TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL AND PLAY ROBIN HOOD--  I REALLY CAN. WELL, GO ON.  GO AND RING THE BELL. I'VE GOT TO FIND SOME WAY OF FINDING OUT IF HE LOVES ME. HE SAYS HE DOES BUT YOU KNOW  WHAT LIARS MEN ARE. DO YOU THINK I SHOULD WEAR MY HAIR IN A BUN? IF HE IDOLIZES ME  LIKE HE SAYS, HOW COME I CAUGHT HIM  WRAPPED SNUGLY ROUND MRS. BAILEY? ONSLOW, DO YOU THINK I SHOULD PUT MY HAIR UP IN A BUN? YEAH, GREAT. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I SAID! - YEAH, GREAT.  - SEE! HOW CAN YOU TELL  IF SOMEBODY REALLY LOVES YOU? LOVES YOU? I MEAN, WAKES UP  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IN A PANIC  BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE DEAD? HAS VISIONS OF YOU LYING IN YOUR COFFIN, IN SOMETHING BLACK  AND ATTRACTIVE? THEY DON'T EVEN NOTICE  IF YOU PUT YOUR HAIR UP  IN A BUN! OH, I WANT TO KNOW  IF HE LOVES ME! DOES HE LOVE YOU SMOKING OTHER PEOPLE'S CIGARETTES? BUG OFF, ONSLOW! OH, NICE. SMILE, RICHARD.

TRY TO BE SOCIABLE, DEAR. HOW ARE YOU KEEPING,  MRS. FORTESCUE? BORED SINCE THEY  TOOK AWAY MY LICENSE. DAMN FOOLS! I KNOW  WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. IT WASN'T  "DRINK AND DRIVING."

I'M GOING TO HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM, ONCE AND FOR ALL. I'M GOING TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH HE REALLY CARES. YOU CAN'T EMBARRASS HIM  WHILE HE'S AT WORK, ASKING HIM  IF HE LOVES YOU. IT WOULD EMBARRASS HIM MORE IF I ASKED HIM AT HOME. HIS WIFE  WOULD BE LISTENING. IS THAT RICHARD'S CAR? OH, GOOD. HE CAN GIVE US A LIFT. - ISN'T THAT DAISY AND ROSE?  - HMM? IT IS. IT'S DAISY AND ROSE. DON'T STOP. - IT LOOKS AS THOUGH  THEY WANT A LIFT.  - DON'T STOP. WE'LL HAVE TO STOP, THEY'VE SEEN US. WE CAN'T CRAM THEM IN THE BACK  WITH MRS. FORTESCUE. OH, WE'LL MANAGE.

WOULD YOU SHOVE UP, PLEASE? HOW FAR ARE YOU GOING? THAT'S WHAT I INTEND  TO ASK MR. HARIWELL. DON'T YOU FIND  LOVE A TORMENT? WELL... I CAN'T SAY I HAVE  FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS. MAYBE I SHOULD'VE  WORN MY HAIR IN A BUN. TOTALLY-- EVERY WEDNESDAY. I'M SURE MRS. FORTESCUE ISN'T INTERESTED IN YOUR ROMANTIC AFFAIRS, ROSE. ON THE CONTRARY, IT'S FASCINATING.
