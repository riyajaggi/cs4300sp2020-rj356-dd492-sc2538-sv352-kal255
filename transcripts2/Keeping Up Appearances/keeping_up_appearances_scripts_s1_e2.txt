 Downloaded From www.AllSubs.org ( theme music playing ) HELLO, IS THAT  THE WHOLESOME BAKERY? NOW TELL ME-- AND I SHALL  KNOW IF YOU'RE LYING-- ARE YOUR FRESH CREAM CAKES  REALLY FRESH? THERE'S NO NEED  TO TAKE THAT ATTITUDE. THIS IS A SERIOUS CUSTOMER INQUIRY. MY NAME IS "BOUQUET," B-U-C-K-E-T. NO, IT'S NOT BUCKET, IT'S "BOUQUET." I WISH TO PLACE A LARGE ORDER,  A VERY IMPORTANT ORDER.

 I HAVE THE NEW VICAR  CALLING THIS AFTERNOON FOR TEA AND LIGHT  REFRESHMENTS. HOW SOON CAN YOU DELIVER? YES, I KNOW  IT'S SATURDAY, AND I'M VERY HAPPY THAT YOU'RE BUSY. I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU  DON'T DELIVER JUST ANYWHERE, THE NEW VICAR COMING FOR TEA  AND LIGHT REFRESHMENTS, AND I WANT SIX  FRESH CREAM CAKES. THAT IS A LARGE ORDER. HELLO? HELLO? HOI POLLOI.

 ( groans ) I WISH YOU WOULDN'T RAISE YOUR ARMS LIKE THAT, RICHARD, NOT WHEN YOU'RE OVERHEATED. IT'S VERY COMMON OUT OF DOORS. IT'S WARM WORK,  HYACINTH. TO PERSPIRE, I WISH YOU'D GO  INTO THE BACK GARDEN, SO AS NOT TO DISTURB  THE PEOPLE WHO RESPECT US  SOCIALLY. I DIDN'T INVENT THE HUMAN COOLING SYSTEM. WE MUSTN'T ABUSE IT, MUST WE, DEAR? WHY ARE MY ROSES NOT AS BIG AS THOSE NEXT DOOR? MAYBE THEY'RE A DIFFERENT VARIETY? I DON'T LIKE OUR ROSES  NOT BEING AS BIG AS  THOSE NEXT DOOR. ARE YOU NEGLECTING THEM, RICHARD? I WANTED THE VICAR TO BE GREETED BY A BLAZE OF PETALED GLORY. THIS TYPE ONLY GROWS TO THIS SIZE, HYACINTH. I'M SURE IF YOU  TRIED HARDER. I KEEP THINKING  YOU'RE OUT HERE GROWING  THESE HUGE ROSES, ALL THE TIME I SUPPOSE  YOU'RE GOSSIPING  WITH PASSERS-BY. FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT, YOU KNOW WHO PASSED BY EARLIER THIS MORNING-- MY GOODNESS! IS THAT A DEAD LEAF? WHY ARE YOU COLLECTING OLD DEAD LEAVES, RICHARD? I'M GONNA  CORNER THE MARKET, THE ENTIRE WORLD MARKET. THEY'RE GOING TO BE BEGGING ME FOR OLD DEAD LEAVES. MMM? GOOD MORNING,  ELIZABETH! GOOD MORNING, HYACINTH. DO COME IN AND WE'LL  HAVE A LITTLE REHEARSAL  FOR THIS AFTERNOON. REHEARSAL? SURELY YOU HAVEN'T  FORGOTTEN YOU'RE HAVING  TEA WITH THE NEW VICAR? AND LIGHT REFRESHMENTS. OH YES,  FOR LIGHT REFRESHMENTS. I'VE HAD THEM BEFORE.  DO WE NEED YOUR REHEARSAL? I NEVER LIKE LEAVING  THINGS TO CHANCE. IT'S THE MARK  OF THE THOUGHTFUL HOSTESS. OOOH! RICHARD! SORRY. DO SIT DOWN,  ELIZABETH. NOT THERE, DEAR.  I LIKE TO FACE  THE WINDOW. OH, DEAR. TSK, TSK, TSK. I'M REALLY RATHER BUSY, HYACINTH. OH, THAT'S NICE, DEAR. NOW, WITH REGARD TO WHAT TO WEAR, I THINK ONE OF US  SHOULD LOOK ATTRACTIVE  IN SOMETHING TASTEFUL AND SUMMERY FLORAL. WHAT WILL YOU WEAR? WELL, I'M RATHER EXPECTING YOU TO TELL ME. I WOULDN'T DREAM  OF INTERFERING. BUT JUST REMEMBER,  THE IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO CLASH  WITH MY SUMMER FLORAL. SINCE WE LIVE NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER, THE LEAST WE CAN DO  IS COORDINATE. I'LL PROBABLY WEAR MY TAN TWO-PIECE. OH, I SEE. NOT MY TAN TWO-PIECE. I THINK SOMETHING A LITTLE  MORE CHIC, DEAR, DON'T YOU? WELL, ALL RIGHT THEN,  MY GREEN PRINT DRESS. ISN'T THAT A LITTLE  REVEALING? MMM. MY ELBOWS, POSSIBLY,  BUT THAT'S ABOUT ALL! YES, I KNOW, DEAR. BUT ARE WE QUITE SURE  WHERE THE NEW VICAR STANDS WITH REGARD  TO NAKED ELBOWS? I DON'T THINK MINE WILL DRIVE HIM WILD. - EXCUSE ME. THAT'S PROBABLY THE WHOLESOME BAKERY RINGING TO APOLOGIZE. WHAT'S WRONG  WITH MY TAN TWO-PIECE? THE "BOUQUET" RESIDENCE,  THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SPEAKING. OH, IT'S YOU, ROSE. IT'S MY SISTER ROSE,  ELIZABETH. SHE'S INCLINED TO BE TALKATIVE AND EXCITABLE, SO DO HELP YOURSELF  TO A BISCUIT, DEAR. AND MIND THE CRUMBS! WHAT IS IT NOW, ROSE? ROSE, YOU WILL NOT  COMMIT SUICIDE, I FORBID IT. NO ONE IN THIS FAMILY  HAS EVER COMMITTED SUICIDE, AND I'M SURE WE'RE NOT  GOING TO START ON THE DAY I'M  HAVING THE NEW VICAR FOR TEA AND LIGHT REFRESHMENTS. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR  ROMANTIC ENTANGLEMENTS ARE, YOU CANNOT HAVE DEAR  DEAD MOMMY'S WEDDING DRESS-- ESPECIALLY TO BE BURIED IN. - I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT  MR. HEPPLEWHITE! WILL YOU  KEEP IT DOWN, ROSE? I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT MR. HEPPLEWHITE-- NOT SINCE THE TRAGEDY. WELL, IT'S WHAT HAPPENS  TO ALL MEN IN THE END, HE'S GONE BACK  TO HIS WIFE. I HAVE TO DIE! I THREATENED HIM I WOULD. WHAT DO YOU FANCY  IN THE 3:00? RAINBOW LADY. HYACINTH! I WANT TO BE BURIED IN MOMMY'S WEDDING DRESS! YOU'VE GOT A BLOODY CHEEK  BEING BURIED IN WHITE. I DON'T SEE WHY YOU  SHOULD HAVE THE DRESS, ANYWAY. SHE WAS MY MOTHER TOO! THE LEAST YOU CAN DO  IS HAVE A LITTLE  SYMPATHY FOR YOUR SISTER  WHEN SHE'S DETERMINED  TO DIE! HAVE YOU SEEN  MY LIBRARY BOOK? HAVE YOU LOOKED WHERE IT USUALLY IS? UNDER THE SETTEE! NO, HYACINTH! NOT THE WEDDING DRESS! OUR DAISY'S  LIBRARY BOOK! WHO'S MR. HEPPLEWHITE? SHE MET HIM LAST WEEK. OH, HE'S LASTED  NEARLY A WEEK THEN? THOUGHT IT WAS  THE REAL THING THIS TIME. AND WHAT DOES BORIS THINK? OH, SHE DOESN'T  TELL BORIS. WHAT'S THE POINT  IN HURTING BORIS? SHE'S VERY THOUGHTFUL, YOUR ROSE. SHE'S GOT A GOOD HEART. A PITY SHE HASN'T GOT A HEAD TO MATCH. ( humming ) - PSST!  - ( humming ) PSST! PSST--  ( spits ) DEAR, GOOD MORNING! IT'S A LOVELY DAY, ISN'T IT? MIND YOU, I SHAN'T  SEE MUCH OF IT. DID I TELL YOU I WAS HAVING  THE NEW VICAR TODAY FOR TEA AND LIGHT  REFRESHMENTS? SEVERAL TIMES. SHE'S PLAINLY SEETHING  WITH ENVY. - MORNING.  - RICHARD! I WILL NOT HAVE  YOU WAVING IN DIRTY  GARDENING GLOVES. THEY GET DIRTY WHEN YOU'RE GARDENING, HYACINTH. CAN'T YOU KEEP ONE PAIR  FOR GARDENING AND ONE PAIR  FOR WAVING? I'VE BEEN STANDING  IN THAT DOORWAY  FOR TWO MINUTES TRYING TO ATTRACT  YOUR ATTENTION. - I WAS WORKING.  - YOU'VE NO RIGHT  TO BE WORKING WHEN I'M HISSING AT YOU.  I'VE GOT ROSE ON  THE TELEPHONE. SHE'S GOING TO--  ( silent ) ( mimics knife ) NOT AGAIN. - WHO IS IT THIS TIME?  - I THINK SHE SAID  A MR. HEPPLEWHITE. THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN. NOBODY EVER COMMITTED SUICIDE FOR SOMEBODY CALLED HEPPLEWHITE. WILL YOU KEEP  YOUR VOICE DOWN,  RICHARD? I'VE GOT ELIZABETH  IN THE KITCHEN. I DON'T WANT  HER OVERHEARING  FAMILY SCANDAL. I WANT YOU TO GO INSIDE  AND ENGAGE ELIZABETH  IN CONVERSATION. I DON'T WANT  HER LISTENING WHILE I'M TRYING  TO CALM ROSE DOWN. NOT IN YOUR  GARDENING SHOES,  RICHARD! GO ROUND THE BACK! ( chuckles ) YES, OF COURSE  I'M HERE, ROSE. I'VE BEEN HERE  ALL THE TIME, DEAR. NOW PULL YOURSELF  TOGETHER, ROSE. WHAT CAN POSSIBLY HAPPEN ONCE A WEEK ON WEDNESDAYS TO MAKE MR. HEPPLEWHITE  SO NECESSARY TO YOU? RICHARD! ARE YOU TALKING  TO ELIZABETH? I'M TALKING! I'M TALKING! ROSE, I KNOW I ASKED  THE QUESTION, BUT I'M NOT STANDING HERE  SURROUNDED BY EXPENSIVE WALLPAPER TO BE GIVEN  DETAILS LIKE THAT. IT'S NOT  AN EXCESSIVE YEAR FOR GREEN-FLY. WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING,  ANYWAY. THEY ARE THERE, BUT NOT IN EXCESS. OH, THAT WAS ROSE. SHE TURNS TO ME FOR ADVICE,  ALL THE FAMILY DO. "RING HYACINTH," THEY SAY. "SHE'LL KNOW." IT GETS VERY WEARING. THANK YOU, DEAR. - ANYTHING WRONG?  - WRONG?! NO, NO! WHY SHOULD THERE  BE ANYTHING WRONG? NO, IT'S JUST SISTER TALK. I LIKE WEEKLY REPORTS ON DADDY'S CONDITION. - HOW IS YOUR FATHER?  - OH, TRAGIC. A BRILLIANT I.Q. STRUGGLING WITH SENILITY. I'D LOVE TO HAVE HIM HERE BUT HE DROPS FOOD  EVERYWHERE. NOW, RICHARD, DON'T JUST SIT THERE. WASH YOUR HANDS, CHANGE YOUR SHOES, THEN I WANT YOU TO GO TO THE WHOLESOME BAKERY WHERE YOU WILL SPEAK TO THE MANAGER ABOUT THEIR DELIVERY POLICY. AND THEN YOU WILL RETURN HERE WITH SIX SUPERIOR FRESH CREAM CAKES. OH, UH, WHAT ABOUT  THEIR DELIVERY POLICY? INEPT.  POINT TO THE FOLLY  OF THEIR NOT UNDERSTANDING CUSTOMERS OF  OUR SOCIAL STATUS. BE SCATHING, RICHARD. CRUSH THEM. ( electric razor buzzing, stops ) SHOULD I WEAR A SUIT  OR SOMETHING CASUAL? CASUAL MIGHT GIVE  THE WRONG IMPRESSION, DEAR. IT IS SATURDAY. EXACTLY!  NEARLY SUNDAY. THE NEW VICAR PROBABLY HAS HALF HIS MIND ALREADY ON TOMORROW'S RELIGIOUS DUTIES. IN WHICH CASE, RICHARD,  IT SEEMS HARDLY FITTING FOR YOU TO COME SLINKING IN, DRESSED FOR FRIVOLITY. FRIVOLITY? 30 YEARS MARRIED, I CAN'T REMEMBER A SINGLE FRIVOL. ( phone ringing ) WEAR A SUIT, DEAR. AND ANSWER THAT, WILL YOU? IT'S FOR YOU,  IT'S ELIZABETH. FROM NEXT DOOR? GET SOMETHING ON. YOU SHOULDN'T BE ANSWERING  THE PHONE TO LADIES  IN THAT CONDITION. ELIZABETH! YES, CERTAINLY I'LL GIVE YOU  THE BENEFIT OF MY OPINION. YES, I LIKE THAT.  I'VE ALWAYS LIKED THAT. I HAVEN'T HAD IT  ALL THAT LONG. IT'S VERY SUITABLE, DEAR. YOU'LL BLEND BEAUTIFULLY  INTO THE BACKGROUND. AHH... THIS SUIT? GOOD GRIEF, RICHARD,  WHY DO YOU ALWAYS ASK ME? I DON'T DETERMINE WHAT PEOPLE WEAR. DO I TAKE IT  THAT'S A YES? CAN'T YOU FIND  A MORE RELIGIOUS TIE? YOU LOOK VERY NICE,  ELIZABETH. THANK YOU, RICHARD. YOU TOO.  VERY SMART. CASUAL WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE. RICHARD! DUTY CALLS. FREQUENTLY. YEAH? BUY SOMETHING, SIR, FROM A GYPSY WOMAN, AND BE LUCKY. YOU BE LUCKY.  HOW ABOUT BUYING FROM ME? I'LL BET YOUR OLD MAN'S GOT  A LOT MORE IN HIS BACK POCKET  THAN I HAVE. I COULD LET HIM  HAVE THAT OLD WRECK  IN THE GARDEN. NOT THERE,  I MEAN THE CAR. BUY SOMETHING FROM THE GYPSY,  MISSUS, AND BE LUCKY. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'VE GOT ANY CHANGE. SHE HASN'T. I'M ABLE TO TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE  "A," I'M PSYCHIC, AND "B," I'M THE ONE THAT  GOES THROUGH HER POCKETS. IT'S BAD LUCK  NOT TO BUY SOMETHING. WHAT'RE YOU SELLING ANYWAY? RIBBONS AND LUCKY CHARMS. JUST WHAT I'VE  ALWAYS WANTED. HAS SHE GOT ANY  LOVE POTIONS, OR-- OPEN RAZORS? TELL YOUR FORTUNE, LADY. SHE KNOWS HER FORTUNE,  SHE'S BEEN MOANING ABOUT IT ALL DAY. WILL YOU GET OUT  OF THE DOORWAY,  ONSLOW? LET THE GYPSY IN. - WHERE'S SHE GOING?  - I'M NOT STANDING OUT HERE HAVING  MY FORTUNE TOLD. YOU'RE VERY FUSSY FOR SOMEONE  WHO'S ABOUT TO COMMIT SUICIDE. I CAN SEE YOU'RE TROUBLED IN LOVE. OH RIGHT. MAKES YOU WONDER  HOW THEY DO IT. IT'S BAD LUCK NOT TO BUY SOMETHING FROM A GYPSY. BAD LUCK? WHEN WE LIVE LIKE THIS,  HOW CAN YOU BE SCARED  OF BAD LUCK? NOW... I THINK  WHEN THEY COME, I'LL SIT YOU THERE,  ELIZABETH. I'LL HAVE THE VICAR HERE,  NEXT TO ME, OF COURSE. AND WE LEAVE THAT ONE  FOR THE VICAR'S WIFE. AND RICHARD WILL SIT NEXT TO HER. RIGHT? OH! SORRY, VICAR. NOW, TOPICS  OF CONVERSATION. MUST KEEP EVERYTHING WHOLESOME. NOTHING CONTROVERSIAL. RICHARD, I THINK I'D  HAVE OUR HOLIDAY SNAPS  AT THE READY. AND WHEN THEY BEGIN TO PALL, I SHALL REGALE THE VICAR WITH TALES OF SHERIDAN'S ACADEMIC PROWESS. - I HOPE THAT'S NOT  A CANCELLATION. HE MAY HAVE BEEN CALLED AWAY FOR A FUNERAL. HOW INCONSIDERATE OF PEOPLE  TO DIE AT THE WEEKEND. THE "BOUQUET" RESIDENCE,  THE LADY OF THE HOUSE SP-- NO, YOU CANNOT HAVE THREE OF 22  AND A PORTION OF 19 WITH CHIPS! THIS IS NOT  THE CHINESE TAKE-AWAY. THIS IS A PRIVATE, SLIMLINE,  PEARL WHITE TELEPHONE, WITH NO ORIENTAL ASSOCIATIONS  WHATSOEVER! THAT WAS AT MIDDLETON. - AH.  - WRONG NUMBER. THE CHINESE TAKEAWAY AGAIN. WE OUGHT TO CHANGE  OUR NUMBER. CHANGE OUR NUMBER! I'VE WRITTEN  TO BRITISH TELECOM INSISTING THEY CHANGE  THE CHINESE NUMBER. I'VE TOLD THEM.  I WON'T STAND HERE LISTENING TO PEOPLE BREATHING SOYA SAUCE  DOWN THE TELEPHONE. - OOOH.  - I THINK I HEARD A CAR. ( car approaching ) OH NO. YOU TELL HER. ME? TELL HYACINTH? ONLY TWO THINGS WRONG WITH THAT-- ONE, SHE NEVER  LISTENS TO ANYBODY; AND TWO, SHE CERTAINLY  NEVER LISTENS TO ME. THAT MEANS I'LL HAVE TO TELL HER. SHE'S YOUR SISTER. SHE'LL GO MAD. THAT COULD BE  AN IMPROVEMENT. - THEY'RE COMING IN.  - OF COURSE THEY'RE COMING IN. - I WANT YOU TO GET THAT CAR AWAY FROM THIS PROPERTY. I WANT THEM AND IT OUT OF THE AVENUE. I JUST CAN'T  SEND THEM AWAY. I WANT THEM OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE THE VICAR COMES. ( doorbell rings ) HYACINTH, ISN'T THAT  YOUR DOORBELL? OH!  ( chuckles ) IT DOES THAT SOMETIMES. IT'S PART OF A VERY EXPENSIVE  TEST SYSTEM. YOU HAVE TO SEE THEM,  HYACINTH. THEY CAN HAVE TWO MINUTES ON THE DOORSTEP! DAISY, ONSLOW,  WHAT A SURPRISE. HOW NICE OF YOU  TO CALL ON THE WAY  TO TOWN. - LET ME WALK YOU TO THE CAR.  - WE'RE NOT GOING TO TOWN. NOT GOING TO TOWN  ON SUCH A PLEASANT  SATURDAY? OF COURSE,  I'D LOVE YOU TO STAY, BUT I'M EXPECTING  THE NEW VICAR FOR TEA  AND LIGHT REFRESHMENTS. - YOU SHOULD HAVE TELEPHONED.  - WE TRIED TO TELEPHONE, - BUT YOU WERE ENGAGED.  - I WAS DEALING WITH  A WRONG NUMBER. SOME DAMN FOOL THINKS  I'M A CHINESE RESTAURANT. TELL HER! TELL ME WHAT? - IT'S DAD. - DADDY? WHAT'S WRONG WITH DADDY? NOT A LOT, APPARENTLY.  ( laughs ) BE QUIET, ONSLOW. TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH DADDY. HE'S MISSING. MISSING? OF COURSE HE'S NOT MISSING! I EXPECT  HE'S JUST MISLAID. HE'S RUN OFF  WITH A GYPSY. KEEP YOUR  VOICE DOWN! HOW COULD HE  HAVE RUN OFF  WITH A GYPSY? ON HIS BIKE  FOR STARTERS. WE HAD A GYPSY AT THE HOUSE. SHE WAS TELLING ROSE HER FORTUNE. WHEN SHE LEFT-- DAD MUST HAVE FOLLOWED HER. DADDY WITH A GOLDEN EARRING. IT'S UNTHINKABLE. - SHOULD WE CALL  THE POLICE?  - NO! NO POLICE.  WE DON'T NEED  ANY SCANDAL. - YOU MUST GO AND FIND HIM.  - WHAT'S GOING ON, HYACINTH? RICHARD WILL GO WITH YOU. IT'S DADDY.  HE'S BEEN KIDNAPPED BY GYPSIES. NOW, RUSH TO DADDY'S  ASSISTANCE. I THOUGHT TRADITIONALLY THEY ONLY KIDNAPPED CHILDREN? BRING DADDY BACK  TO ME, RICHARD. AS FAR AS DAISY'S,  ANYWAY. ( engine sputtering ) ( sputtering continues ) ( engine starts, bangs ) ( car departs ) ( door opens ) - WHAT IS IT, HYACINTH?  - IT'S DADDY. HE'S BEEN  KIDNAPPED BY GYPSIES. OH MY GOODNESS! WE MUST RING  THE POLICE! NO! NO POLICE. WE CAN'T. DAISY'S WEARING SLIPPERS,  ONSLOW'S GOT BARE ARMS. WHY WOULD THE GYPSIES  KIDNAP YOUR FATHER? I EXPECT FOR RANSOM. THEY'LL BE AFTER MY VERY EXPENSIVE ROYAL DOULTON CHINA WITH THE HAND-PAINTED  PERIWINKLES. WHY WOULD HE  RUN AWAY WITH A GYPSY? LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY, JUST HOPE YOU CATCH HIM BEFORE HE GETS MARRIED. I THOUGHT  HE WAS IN BED. I COULD HEAR  HIS TELLY. HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED  TO ANTICIPATE YOUR OWN FATHER SNEAKING OUT UNDER  THE COVER OF TELEVISION  IN PURSUIT OF A GYPSY? HAS HE ALWAYS FANCIED THE ROMANY LIFE? HE NEVER SAID. - ( taps )  - WE'RE RUNNING DRY. GOT ANY  PETROL MONEY? I DIDN'T BRING  A PURSE. DOWN TO YOU, DICKY. I'VE CHANGED MY CLOTHES. I'VE LEFT ALL MY MONEY AT HOME. NOW... I WANT YOU  TO SIT HERE, VICAR. I'VE HAD MANY A RELIGIOUS INSPIRATION ON THAT SOFA. OH! ( laughs ) AND IF YOUR CHARMING WIFE  WOULD LIKE TO SIT HERE, WHERE SHE'LL BE WITHIN  EASY REACH OF MY TASTY, HOMEMADE CANAPES. IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU  TO INVITE US, MRS. BUCKET. IT'S "BOUQUET," VICAR. OH, I'M SORRY. IT'S OF FRENCH  ORIGIN. I BELIEVE MY HUSBAND'S FAMILY IN THE DISTANT PAST WERE "HUGUENICKS"  OR SOMETHING. NOT THAT THERE'S ANY FRENCH BLOOD IN HIM NOW OF COURSE. YOU MAY REST ASSURED,  VICAR, YOU'RE QUITE SAFE, THERE ARE NO  FRENCH HABITS HERE. ( laughing ) ELIZABETH, IF YOU COULD  PASS ROUND MY ROYAL DOULTON WITH THE HAND-PAINTED  PERIWINKLES? MUST I, HYACINTH?  I'M TERRIFIED OF DROPPING ONE. IT IS LOVELY CHINA,  MRS. BUCKET. UH-- "BOUQUET!" IT IS SOMETHING OF A FAMILY HEIRLOOM. I-- LOOK, I THINK IT REALLY  WOULD BE BETTER, HYACINTH, - IF WE ALL HELPED OURSELVES.  - YES! WE CAN DO THAT. YES, JOLLY GOOD IDEA. ( Hyacinth stuttering ) I DID HAVE IN MIND  SOMETHING RATHER  MORE ORDERLY. ( car backfires ) IF THE ASSEMBLED COMPANY WOULD PLEASE EXCUSE ME. SOMETHING'S  JUST COME UP. OOOH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING  BACK HERE? WHY DID YOU BRING THEM BACK HERE? I WANT SOME PETROL MONEY.  IT'S IN MY OTHER SUIT. GET THEM OUT OF SIGHT! AS SOON AS  I GET THE MONEY. WHY DON'T YOU-- GET IN THE CAR, ONSLOW? I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO RAIN. YES, THERE IT IS. I CAN FEEL IT NOW. RAIN. CAN'T FEEL A THING. ANY MINUTE NOW-- THERE IT IS. RAIN. IF WE CAN'T FIND DAD, WE'LL HAVE TO RING  THE POLICE. I WILL NOT HAVE THIS FAMILY INVOLVED WITH THE POLICE. HEY, THEY'RE ALL RIGHT WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW THEM. TO KNOW THEM! ISN'T THAT OUR ROSE? OH MY GOD. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN BLACK?  - I'M IN MOURNING. - WHO FOR?  - FOR ME! NOBODY ELSE WILL. ( sniffles )  MR. HEPPLEWHITE DOESN'T CARE. ROSE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'VE COME FOR MOMMY'S  WEDDING DRESS! - I'VE TOLD YOU,  YOU CAN'T HAVE--  - IT WON'T FIT YOU ANYWAY. IT'LL DO TO BE BURIED IN. YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.  THE VICAR'S IN THERE. OH GREAT! HE CAN READ ME THE BURIAL SERVICE! OH NO! WHO'S FUNERAL  IS SHE GOING TO? SOMEBODY SHE'S VERY CLOSE TO. ( door opens, slams ) YOU CAN'T JUST BURST IN.  THEY'RE HAVING TEA AND LIGHT  REFRESHMENTS. YOU CAN'T BEGRUDGE A PERSON A VICAR WHEN THEY'RE ON THE BRINK OF THE GRAVE! YOU'RE NOT ON THE BRINK, YOU'VE HARDLY SET FOOT IN THE CEMETERY. HAVE YOU ANY IDEA OF THE LOVE I BEAR FOR MR. HEPPLEWHITE? YOU'RE DROPPING PETALS  ON MY LACQUERED WOODBLOCK. THIS IS THE LAST TIME I SHALL INCONVENIENCE YOU. DON'T TRY AND STOP ME! IT'S CRUEL TO ASK ME TO LIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART! ROSE! - HE'S VERY YOUNG!  - YOU-- YOU NEVER SAID  HE WAS YOUNG. - YEAH, I-- ROSE!  - IT'S VERY WICKED  OF YOU, HYACINTH. - KEEPING HIM  ALL TO YOURSELF.  - ROSE! ( phone ringing ) THE "BOUQUET" RESIDENCE, THE LADY OF THE HOUSE-- OH, SHERIDAN, HOW WONDERFUL  TO HEAR YOUR VOICE, DEAR! WHAT A CLOSE PSYCHIC BOND  BETWEEN YOU AND I. ?50? WHY DO YOU NEED ?50,  DEAR? WHY DO YOU WANT CURTAIN MATERIAL? A FLAT? WHOSE FLAT? SHERIDAN, YOU'RE NOT MOVING IN  WITH SOME DESIGNING FEMALE. OH, IT'S NOT A GIRL'S FLAT,  IT'S A BOY'S FLAT. AND YOU'RE MAKING  YOUR OWN CURTAINS?  HOW INVENTIVE, DEAR. YOUR FRIEND ALWAYS MAKES  HIS OWN CURTAINS. I SEE. ( engine sputtering ) DON'T WORRY. - BLOODY THING. YOU SHOULDN'T BE MUTTERING  THINGS LIKE THAT, ONSLOW. NOT WITH A VICAR  IN THE VICINITY. BY ALL MEANS SEND ME  A SAMPLE OF HIS EMBROIDERY. IT'S A LIFELINE  FINDING SOMEONE  YOU CAN CONFIDE IN. - ROSE. ROSE!  - WHAT A PITY YOU  DON'T DO CONFESSIONS. YOU COULD HAVE A BALL  WITH MINE. ROSE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THE VICAR? SHERIDAN, DEAR, WILL YOU  HOLD JUST A MOMENT? I'M SURE SHE'S NOT GOING AT HIM. SHE JUST NEEDS A SHOULDER TO CRY ON. SHE DIDN'T LOOK AS THOUGH  SHE WAS ABOUT TO CRY TO ME! SHE WAS DOING EVERYTHING BUT BITE HIS NECK. SHE'S VERY EMOTIONAL, DEAR. THINK OF IT AS A HORMONE IMBALANCE. WE DO-- WE ALWAYS THINK OF IT AS A HORMONE IMBALANCE! IT'S VERY KIND OF THE VICAR. HE MAY HAVE SAVED MY SISTER FROM A DESPERATE ACT! WHERE'S MY HUSBAND?  WHICH WAY DID HE GO?  WHERE'S MY HUSBAND? - REALLY, I MUST STAY.  - OH, BY THE WAY! DAD'S COME BACK  WITH A STACK OF RIBBONS  AND LUCKY CHARMS. COME ON. WHERE IS HE GOING? WHERE IS SHE TAKING HIM? - WHERE IS HE GOING?  - HE'S PROBABLY BETTER OFF  DOWN THERE THAN LISTENING  TO WHAT ONSLOW'S  SAYING. ( horn blowing ) DO FEEL FREE TO POP IN AT ANY TIME, DEAR. THERE'LL ALWAYS BE A WELCOME FOR YOU AT THE "BOUQUETS'." WHAT A DISASTER TO MY TEA  AND LIGHT REFRESHMENTS. I COULD MURDER SOME  LIGHT REFRESHMENTS. IF IT WASN'T FOR SHERIDAN'S GOOD NEWS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS DAY WOULD HAVE BEEN. GOOD NEWS FROM SHERIDAN? HE'S MOVED IN WITH A VERY SUITABLE FRIEND. THEY'RE MAKING  THEIR OWN CURTAINS. APPARENTLY HIS FRIEND'S VERY GOOD WITH A NEEDLE. HE HAS PRIZES  FOR EMBROIDERY. YOU BETTER COME IN AND HAVE SOME TEA AND LIGHT REFRESHMENTS. ONSLOW... BEFORE YOU COME IN, JUST SHIFT THIS WRECK NEXT DOOR, WILL YOU, DEAR? "PRIZES FOR EMBROIDERY"? LET'S MOVE THE CAR,  SHALL WE, ONSLOW?
