 IT'S JUST THAT HE'S SURROUNDED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PEOPLE. WELL, THEY'RE  YOUR FAMILY, HYACINTH. THERE ARE BLACK SHEEP IN THE BEST  REGULATED FAMILIES. GETTING READY  FOR INSPECTION,  RICHARD? HELLO, LIZ.  YES. HYACINTH FANCIES  A RUN IN THE COUNTRY. I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'D  LIKE TO MAKE UP A THREESOME. NO! THANK YOU,  BUT I'M GOING TO BE  VERY BUSY. VERY KIND  OF YOU TO ASK. - GOOD MORNING, ELIZABETH.  - MORNING, HYACINTH. HOW RELAXED  AND CASUAL YOU LOOK. PERHAPS I OUGHT TO BE GARDENING, TOO,

 BUT RICHARD INSISTS ON TAKING ME ON AN OUTING SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY,  SOMEWHERE EDUCATIONAL,  NATURALLY-- SOAK UP A LITTLE CULTURE. I FEEL I OWE IT TO SHERIDAN. - WELL, HAVE A NICE TIME.  - THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM,  IF YOU'D CARE TO-- NO!  THANK YOU. I THINK I BETTER WAIT HERE  IN CASE MY HUSBAND TELEPHONES. IT'S NICE WHEN THEY  TELEPHONE, ISN'T IT? RICHARD ALWAYS TELEPHONES ME  WHEN HE'S AWAY AND SHERIDAN RINGS ME  CONTINUALLY. WHEN WAS I AWAY? HAVE I EVER BEEN AWAY? I DON'T REMEMBER  THE PRECISE OCCASION, DEAR. BUT I DO REMEMBER THAT YOU TELEPHONED. FUNNY. IF YOU'D HAVE ASKED ME, I'D HAVE SWORN I'D NEVER BEEN AWAY. NEVER BEEN AWAY. VERY NICE,  RICHARD. OUR REGARDS TO YOUR HUSBAND WHEN HE RINGS FROM THE FAR EAST. TELL HIM  WE OFTEN ASK AFTER HIM. I WILL, HYACINTH.  THANK YOU. THINGS LIKE "WHY DOESN'T HE COME HOME MORE?" IS THEIR MARRIAGE HAPPY  DO YOU THINK? GOOD LORD YES, HE LIVES ABROAD MOST OF THE TIME. WHY DOESN'T HE  COME HOME MORE OFTEN? I DON'T SUPPOSE  HIS FIRM ALLOWS HIM. IT COSTS MONEY. WHEN HE DOES COME HOME,  I DO HOPE HE WON'T BE RIDDLED WITH  TROPICAL AILMENTS. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WE'LL HAVE TO BE VERY AWARE WHICH GLASS HE DRINKS FROM AT MY CANDLELIGHT SUPPERS. ( engine starts ) DRIVE VERY SLOWLY  PAST NUMBER 23, I WANT HER TO SEE  MY HAT. Richard:  NOW, WE CAN GO  THE LANGLEY WAY OR THROUGH RIDLEY. WHICH WAY  WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO? I WISH YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME, RICHARD. ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE THE "B" ROAD AND WE'LL GO  THE LANGLEY WAY. I'D MUCH RATHER  WE WENT THE RIDLEY WAY. I LIKE  THE RIDLEY WAY. ON SECOND THOUGHT, I THINK WE'LL GO THE RIDLEY WAY. I'LL TURN ROUND IN THE GARAGE. ( bell rings ) YOU KNOW, I REALLY OUGHT TO VISIT DADDY FIRST. TURN LEFT FOR DADDY. ON REFLECTION,  I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER  TO SEE DADDY ON THE WAY BACK. TURNING ROUND. ( bell rings ) NO, MY CONSCIENCE  IS PRICKING ME. I MUST PUT  DADDY FIRST. LEFT AGAIN. ON SECOND THOUGHTS, I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GO TO CARLDON HALL FIRST, BEFORE IT BECOMES  TOO CROWDED. SECOND THOUGHTS. ( bell rings ) ANYWAY, I NEED TIME  TO PREPARE FOR ONSLOW. I CAN'T STAND  THE SIGHT OF ONSLOW LOUNGING ABOUT DRINKING BEER IN HIS UNDERSHIRT. WATCH THE CYCLIST. I'M WATCHING THE CYCLIST, HYACINTH. MY EYES ARE RIVETED TO THE CYCLIST. AREN'T WE GOING TOO FAST?  THIS IS A BUILT-UP AREA. I'M UNDER THE LIMIT. WELL, YOU WENT PAST  NUMBER 23 TOO FAST. FAR TOO FAST. SHE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY  TO SEE MY HAT. AND WATCH THE LORRY. WHICH LORRY? THERE YOU ARE, YOU SEE.  YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE LORRY. - WHERE IS HE?  - PARKED OVER THERE. WHY SHOULD I WATCH A STATIONARY LORRY PARKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A DUAL CARRIAGE-WAY. I DON'T THINK I LIKE YOUR TONE,  RICHARD. CHANGING TONE. ( tires screech ) - NOW WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?  - IT'S NO GOOD. I CAN'T GO BLITHELY  OFF INTO THE COUNTRY. I MUST VISIT DADDY. I'D BETTER NOT PARK OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.  IT BLOCKS THE STREET. HOW COULD MY SISTER  MARRY ONSLOW? CONCEIVABLY  SHE LOVED HIM. DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.  HOW CAN YOU LOVE AN ONSLOW? HE SINGS  ON COACH TRIPS. I JUST PRAY I'M NEVER  SEEN HERE BY PEOPLE OF OUR OWN SOCIAL STANDING. I HATE KEEPING  DADDY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. - IT'S WHERE HE WAS BORN.  - THAT'S NOT THE IMPRESSION  I CARE TO CULTIVATE. I EXPECT PEOPLE TO ASSUME  THAT I WAS BORN INTO THE CANDLELIGHT SUPPER CLASS. DON'T YOU SCREAM AT ME. I NEVER TOUCHED  YOUR HUSBAND. I WOULDN'T TOUCH HIM  WITH A SIX-FOOT POLE! I WISH I COULD FIND A SIX-FOOT POLE. A SORT OF...  YOUNGER LECH WALENSA. I CAN'T HELP IT IF YOUR HUSBAND  THROWS HIMSELF AT ME! HE WAS NOT ENCOURAGED. IF HE CAN'T KEEP HIS HANDS OFF ME,  THAT'S HIS PROBLEM. SAW ME WITH HIM  DOING WHAT? WELL, SHE'S LYING. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU FOUND IN HIS CAR, THEY'RE NOT MINE. ( panting ) WHAT'S THE MATTER?  ARE WE ON FIRE? I'VE JUST SEEN  A CAR PULL UP.  IT'S OUR HYACINTH. - OH, GOD!  - WELL, NEAR ENOUGH. I'LL HAVE TO GO. I'LL FIGHT WITH YOU LATER. I WONDERED WHERE I'D LOST THAT PAIR. HELP ME TIDY UP. WHAT'S OUR HYACINTH  DOING HERE? I EXPECT SHE'S COME TO VISIT FATHER. I WISH SHE'D  GIVE US SOME NOTICE-- LIKE ABOUT  THREE MONTHS. PUT THE KETTLE ON, ROSE. - MAKE A CUP OF TEA.  - IS ONSLOW GETTING UP? OH, YOU KNOW ONSLOW. NOT UNLESS  IT'S WORLD WAR III. OH! LEAVE IT.  LEAVE IT. ( barking ) YOU'VE WOKEN THE DOG. GOOD MORNING,  ONSLOW. DON'T SAY  GOOD MORNING TO HIM WHEN I'VE JUST BEEN  SAVAGED BY HIS DOG. LESS NOISE,  YOU DAFT BITCH. AND THAT GOES  FOR YOU AS WELL, DOG. ( laughing ) ( aluminum can crunches ) AREN'T YOU SMOKING  TOO MANY, ROSE? IT HELPS KEEP YOUR FIGURE. IT'S AMAZING HOW MANY FELLAS SHE KEEPS IT FOR. SHUT YOUR FACE,  ONSLOW. ANY MORE TEA?  OR MORE TO THE POINT, - ANY MORE BEAKERS?  - YOU CAN HAVE THE REST  OF THIS. TA. - WELL, HOW IS DADDY?  - DAFT AS A BRUSH. - BE QUIET, ONSLOW.  - WELL, HE GETS BARMY. - DOES THE DOG  LIVE IN THE CAR?  - SHE LIKES THE CAR. - YEAH, SO--  - I'M TALKING ABOUT DADDY. - SORRY. - I WISH HE'D  LIVE IN THE CAR. WHO'S A LOVELY  GIRL, THEN? WHICH IS MORE THAN COULD  BE SAID FOR YOUR HYACINTH. WHERE DID SHE  GET THAT HAT? THE HAT?  STRIKING, ISN'T IT? I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COPE  DAY IN AND DAY OUT. OH, YOU...  GET USED TO IT. THAT'S TERRIFYING. THAT'S THE MOST  FRIGHTENING THING  I'VE EVER HEARD. HOW LONG HAVE YOU  HAD THE DOG? OH, SHE ADOPTED US LAST WEEK. I THOUGHT SHE'D SLEEP WITH US ON THE BED BUT SHE PREFERS  THE CAR. YOU'VE NEVER  HAD A DOG, DICKY? NO, HYACINTH CAN'T DO WITH THE MESS. YOU KNOW, WE OUGHT TO GO OUT AND HAVE A DRINK SOMETIME, YOU AND ME. WHERE ARE YOU HEADING FOR TODAY? HYACINTH LIKES TO VISIT  THESE STATELY HOMES. WE'LL PROBABLY END UP  IN CARLDON HALL. CARLDON HALL? THAT SOUNDS  REALLY BORING. PROBABLY WILL BE. USUALLY IS. ( car engine running ) ( whines ) RIGHT. WHERE IS THE BITCH?! SHE'S INSIDE, LOVE.  UPSTAIRS. I'LL KILL HER! I'LL PLUCK HER EYES OUT! WHO IS SHE? IT'S USUALLY THE WIFE OF ONE OF ROSE'S BOYFRIENDS. ( screaming ) NEVER MIND WHO I AM! TO SORT YOU OUT! NEVER MIND WHO YOU ARE?! YOU COME BURSTING IN-- COME BURSTING IN! A DROP MORE TEA, HYACINTH? TEA? HADN'T WE BETTER DO SOMETHING? THERE'S A MAD WOMAN ATTACKING ROSE UPSTAIRS. OH, NO.  ROSE WILL BE FINE. SHE'S VERY EXPERIENCED. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE TROUBLE. POOR DADDY LYING SICK IN THE NEXT ROOM, LEARNING THE SINS OF HIS YOUNGEST DAUGHTER AT FULL VOLUME. WHAT DOES DADDY MAKE OF ALL THESE SCENES? OH, HE NEVER BOTHERS. YOU KNOW FATHER. HE'S IN A WORLD  OF HIS OWN. BY THE WAY,  BEFORE YOU GO, DO YOU MIND  IF I TRY YOUR HAT? ONSLOW HATES ME  IN A HAT. ( laughs )  NO. NO, I TELL A LIE. ONSLOW WOULD NEVER NOTICE ME IN A HAT. HE CAN HARDLY RAISE A GRUNT THESE DAYS FOR YOUR BEST EFFORTS IN BRA AND BLACK STOCKINGS. WILL ROSE BE ALL RIGHT? ROSE WILL BE FINE.  ROSE CAN HANDLE WIVES. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING  SHE HANDLES MORE OFTEN AND THAT'S HUSBANDS. ( television starts playing music ) ONSLOW, THERE'S SOMEBODY CLIMBING DOWN YOUR DRAINPIPE DRESSED IN A BALACLAVA AND A FANCY CAPE. - ARE YOU BEING BURGLED? - NO, THAT'S NOT A BURGLAR. THAT'S YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW. HYACINTH'S DADDY? WHAT'S HE DOING? THIS WEEK HE'S BEING CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT, SWORD OF JUSTICE, STRIKING TERROR  INTO THE HEARTS  OF ALL EVILDOERS. BUT IS HE ANY GOOD AT DRAINPIPES? ( crash ) NOT A LOT. HE'S GONE DOWN  THE STREET. HADN'T WE BETTER GET AFTER HIM? - PERSONALLY, I'M  INCLINED NOT TO BOTHER. - REALLY? HE'S ONLY GONNA RESCUE HER  AT THE POST OFFICE. - WHAT FROM?  - A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH,  I THINK HE SAID, AT THE HANDS OF SOME TOTALLY HAIRLESS GREEN PEOPLE FRESH FROM OUTER SPACE AND DESPERATE FOR  A WHITE WOMAN. I DON'T THINK  WE SHOULD TELL HYACINTH. I'LL GO ALONG  WITH THAT. BUT HOW WILL WE  GET HIM BACK? - THEY'LL GET A COUPLE OF  CUSTOMERS TO BRING HIM BACK.  - REALLY? IT'S THE POST OFFICE. THEY DELIVER. YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT. IT COULD DO  WITH A COAT OF PAINT. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET THE DECORATORS IN. CAN'T ONSLOW DECORATE? MY ONSLOW?  ( laughs ) OH, NO. HE'S MORE...  YOUR BIG IDLE SLOB. OH, WE WARNED YOU, DAISY, WHEN YOU MARRIED HIM. I KNOW,  YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM  MARKS FOR CONSISTENCY. - LISTEN. - I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING. THAT'S JUST IT-- I CAN'T HEAR THEM ARGUING ANYMORE. IT'S GONE QUIET. DEATHLY QUIET. I DON'T LIKE IT. I WARNED ROSE THAT HER WAY OF LIFE WOULD ONE DAY LEAD TO TRAGEDY. NOBODY CAN SHOW  THAT AMOUNT OF LEG AND EXPECT TO BE  GUIDED SUPERNATURALLY. I CAN'T EVEN HEAR  OUR ROSE SMOKING. OH, MY GOODNESS.  YOU DON'T THINK-- OOH! ROSE ISN'T  USUALLY VIOLENT. Hyacinth:  NO, BUT WHAT ABOUT  THAT OTHER WOMAN?! ( sobbing ) - MEN!  - THEY'RE ALL SWINES! IT'S US WOMEN  THAT SUFFER. SHOULD THAT BE "IT'S WE WOMEN WHO SUFFER"? - WE'LL MAKE HIM PAY.  - OOH, I'D LIKE THAT. IT WILL BE A PLEASURE. I'LL HAVE TO GO GET HIS DINNER ON. AND YOU, LOVE. THAT ROSE, SHE KNOWS  WHAT SUFFERING IS. YOU'RE A SWINE TO YOUR WIFE, YOU MISERABLE, NO-GOOD-- HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE  A SWINE TO YOUR WIFE? I'LL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW--  BECAUSE SHE'S JUST LEFT HERE. OH, I BET THAT'S  JUST MADE HIS DAY. DAISY, DADDY'S NOT  IN HIS ROOM. WHERE'S HE GONE?  HE SHOULDN'T BE  OUT ON HIS OWN. HE WON'T BE ON HIS OWN. HE'LL BE IN THE GRIP OF A COUPLE OF CUSTOMERS. - MMM?  - PROBABLY WOMEN. OH, HOW CONSIDERATE. I EXPECT HE'S HELPING THEM BOTH SAFELY ACROSS  A BUSY ROAD. AND YOU CAN TAKE  YOUR ILLUSTRATED  EROTIC BOOKS BACK! HOW YOU CAN SPEND MONEY ON-- WOULD YOU LIKE  A DROP MORE TEA,  HYACINTH? I THINK NOT,  NO THANK YOU. - RICHARD--  - I DON'T MEAN THE BLACK  RUBBER CLOTHING SECTION! THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION YOU SHOULD BE OVERHEARING. YOU WEREN'T ALL  THAT TERRIFIC ANYWAY. BOOKS OR NO BOOKS,  WITH YOUR BUILD YOU'D NO CHANCE OF GETTING PAST PAGE 22. AY! JUST LET'S GO. I'VE HAD ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY. BAD ENOUGH DAISY MARRIED TO ONSLOW, BUT TO LET HIM DRINK OUT OF HER BEAKER. AND AS FOR ROSE, I SUPPOSE ONE  OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT AT LEAST SHE'S MISBEHAVING  WITH SOMEONE LITERATE. WELL, YOU'VE DONE YOUR DUTY. YOU VISITED YOUR FATHER. I CAN'T BELIEVE  HE TRIES TO FORCE HIMSELF ON THE POSTMISTRESS. WELL, AT LEAST  YOU KNOW HE'S FIT. MMM? NO, I EXPECTED  SOMETHING QUITE SIMPLE. PROBABLY THE EFFORT  OF LICKING HIS STAMPS SENT THE BLOOD  RUSHING TO HIS TONGUE AND HE STUMBLED TOWARDS HER.  POOR DADDY. IT'S DICKY I FEEL SORRY FOR. SHE'S GOT EYES EVERYWHERE. I REALLY BELIEVE  OUR HYACINTH CAN SEE THROUGH  LAMINATED SURFACES TO THE GRIME  UNDERNEATH. I'M GOING TO HAVE  TO CLEAN THAT KITCHEN. IF WE ALL GOT "STOOKEN," WE COULD SOON  CLEAN THAT KITCHEN. TALK TO YOURSELF,  DAISY. THERE'S YOUR FATHER BEING TAKEN HOME NOW. DO YOU WANT TO STOP? NO, IT'S TOO EMBARRASSING. HE SEEMS TO BE HAPPY. THAT'S NOT THE KIND  OF BEHAVIOR ONE EXPECTS  FROM CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON. 50p FOR THE CAR PARK, PLEASE. OH, CAN'T WE PARK IN THAT LITTLE SPACE NEARER THE HOUSE? THAT'S RESERVED  FOR THE FAMILY, MADAM. I'M NOT SAYING  I AM FAMILY, BUT I HAVE  WRITTEN TO HER LADYSHIP  FROM TIME TO TIME FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES. I'M SURE SHE'D REMEMBER  MY PERSONAL EMBOSSED WRITING PAPER-- SAFFRON WITH MATCHING ENVELOPES. YOU'LL HAVE TO PARK IN THE PUBLIC AREA, MADAM. IT ISN'T AS IF  WE BELONG WITH THE MASSES, I HAVE A SON  AT UNIVERSITY. I'M SORRY, MADAM. MY HUSBAND IS AN OFFICER  OF A LARGE LOCAL AUTHORITY. I WISH YOU WOULDN'T INVOLVE ME, HYACINTH. ENORMOUS SUMS OF MONEY  PASS THROUGH HIS HANDS. I'D REALLY RATHER JUST SIT HERE IN NEUTRAL. - YOU'LL HAVE TO PARK  IN THE PUBLIC AREA, MADAM.  - I DON'T THINK-- HYACINTH, IT'S NOT WORTH UPSETTING HIS LORDSHIP. VERY WELL, DEAR. THANK YOU. DRIVE ON, RICHARD. WHY DO WE ALWAYS  COME TO THIS ROOM? BECAUSE IT'S NEAR  THE FAMILY QUARTERS, DEAR. ONE OF THESE DAYS I SHALL CATCH HIS LORDSHIP'S EYE, OR BETTER YET, HER LADYSHIP'S, AND I SHALL STRIKE UP AN ACQUAINTANCE. AND THEN WE'LL SEE  WHO CAN PARK IN THE LITTLE  PRIVATE AREA. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE  THROUGH THERE YET. DO BE PATIENT,  RICHARD DEAR. THE IMPORTANT THING  TO REMEMBER ABOUT  THE ARISTOCRACY IS THEIR  IMPECCABLE MANNERS. ONCE WE'VE ESTABLISHED  EYE CONTACT, WE'RE ALMOST HONOR BOUND  TO BE INVITED TO TEA. IT'S NOT VERY LIKELY, HYACINTH. ANOTHER THING IS THAT THE ARISTOCRACY ALWAYS RECOGNIZE  QUALITY. WHY AM I WEARING  THIS HAT? - LET THESE PEOPLE PASS,  RICHARD.  - NO, NO, NO, AFTER YOU. NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE'RE WAITING FOR HIS LORDSHIP. OH. I AM SORRY. I THOUGHT  YOU WERE JUST VISITORS. I KNOW. PEOPLE KEEP MAKING THAT MISTAKE. ( booms ) YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BELIEVE THIS. - HOW MUCH YOU GOT, ROSE?  - 20. 50p PLEASE, SIR.  SEE IF YOU CAN FIND US A BIT OF A SLOPE TO PARK ON. ONLY THIS OLD BITCH ISN'T TOO CLEVER AT STARTING AGAIN. - I CAN BELIEVE THAT.  - ( Onslow laughs ) HERE, HAVE YOU HAD A WELL-POLISHED CAR THROUGH HERE, DRIVER LOOKING SHELL-SHOCKED? WOMAN WITH A BIG HAT? SHE WAS MURDER. THAT'S THE ONE. ( engine roars loudly ) WE OUGHT TO MOVE ON  A BIT, HYACINTH. NOW DO BE PATIENT, RICHARD. ABSORB THE PICTURE. I'VE BEEN ABSORBING IT  FOR 10 MINUTES. 10 MINUTES? THESE WORKS OF ART ARE PAINTED TO BE ENJOYED FOREVER. IT'S BEGINNING TO FEEL  LIKE FOREVER. WE'LL LEAVE WHEN I'VE HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE FAMILY. WHAT'S THE POINT? THE POINT IS TO BEGIN BUILDING UP A RELATIONSHIP. THAT'S THE POINT. THEY DON'T KNOW  YOU FROM ADAM. LIKE ATTRACTS LIKE. THEY'LL RECOGNIZE  BREEDING WHEN THEY SEE IT. ISN'T THAT  A LOVELY PICTURE? I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I MET HER LADYSHIP. WHEN?  WHEN DID YOU MEET HER? WE MET, OF COURSE, THE FIRST TIME WHEN SHE OPENED THE GARDEN PARTY. YOU WERE IN THE CROWD,  THAT'S ALL. SHE KEPT LOOKING IN MY DIRECTION. I BELIEVE MY DEPORTMENT IMPRESSED HER. I SUPPOSE THE LAST TIME WE WERE TOGETHER MUST HAVE BEEN AT THAT DINNER AFTER THE GALA PERFORMANCE OF SWAN LAKE. SHE KNOWS THE FAMILY. THEY'RE FRIENDS  OF THE FAMILY. OF COURSE HER  LADYSHIP AND I HAVE WORKED TOGETHER  FOR CHARITY. - WHEN WAS THAT?  - THE GARDEN PARTY. OUR FAMILIES, HER LADYSHIP'S AND MINE, ARE NOT WITHOUT THEIR LINKS. MY FATHER, TOO, IS NO NOVICE WHEN IT COMES  TO CARRYING A SWORD. Onslow: ARE YOU UP THERE, DICKY? ( Onslow continues ) ONSLOW. - DID YOU TELL HIM?  - TELL HIM WHAT? - YOU MUST HAVE TOLD HIM.  - TOLD HIM WHAT? - WHERE WE WERE GOING. - I MAY HAVE MENTIONED  SOMETHING. FANCY DOING THAT. YOU PRACTICALLY INVITED HIM. HYACINTH,  HE'S HERE NOW. WE JUST CAN'T  KEEP RUNNING. I WILL NOT BE FOUND  ON STATELY PREMISES IN THE COMPANY OF SOMEONE WHO DRINKS BEER  IN HIS UNDERSHIRT. ONLY WHEN HE CAN  AFFORD IT. Daisy:  I DON'T THINK HYACINTH  WILL WELCOME IT WHEN WE DO FIND HER. WHAT ABOUT THAT CAR PARK ATTENDANT? - I RATHER LIKE  THAT CAR PARK ATTENDANT.  - OH. I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WANT  TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON  WITH HYACINTH. I DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON WITH YOUR HYACINTH. IT'S YOUR FATHER WHO'S SENILE, NOT ME. WE'RE HERE TO RESCUE POOR OLD DICKY. HE'S THE ONE  I FEEL SORRY FOR. I JUST THOUGHT SOMEONE SHOULD RESCUE HIM AND GET SOME BEVYS DOWN HIM. WHAT THE HELL DO CALL THAT? IT'S ART. ART? I WOULDN'T WRAP  MY CHIPS UP IN IT. HERE, ROSE, WHAT DO YOU RECKON OF THIS? AHHHH-- HIDE. THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY. COME ON! RICHARD! PSST!  PSST! CAN I HELP YOU? THIS IS NOT A PUBLIC AREA, YOU KNOW. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M A FRIEND  OF THE FAMILY'S. HER LADYSHIP AND I ARE OLD ACQUAINTANCES. SO IT WOULD BE  VERY UNWISE OF YOU - TO START GETTING OFFICIOUS.  - OH, YES BUT-- WE'RE MERELY HIDING FROM SOME UNACCEPTABLE PERSON WHO'S TRYING  PURSUE US. THERE ARE SUCH ODD PEOPLE ABOUT. I'M SURE  YOU UNDERSTAND. Hyacinth: HOW WAS I TO KNOW THAT THAT WAS HIS LORDSHIP? HE LOOKED  LIKE THE GARDENER. HE MUST BE VERY LOW DOWN  ON THE ARISTOCRATIC SCALE IF HE LOOKS LIKE  A GARDENER. I THINK IT'S  IRRESPONSIBLE. HE'S NO RIGHT  TO LOOK LIKE A GARDENER. ( theme music playing ) www.tvsubtitles.net Downloaded From www.AllSubs.org
