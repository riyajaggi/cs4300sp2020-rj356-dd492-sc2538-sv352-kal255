 Death in Paradise (2011–…): Season 3, Episode 1 - Episode #3.1 - full transcript 
 A quartet of Poole's university friends comes to the island and, whilst they are playing charades, Poole is murdered. Shambling inspector Humphrey Goodman arrives from England to lead the investigation and does not impress the locals with his clumsiness. He is surprised when the four suspects claim they did not know Poole worked on the island but then lawyer Angela Birkett confesses that she planned it as she had always had a crush on Poole, though he preferred Sasha, now married to abrasive James Moore. The other suspect, hard up Roger Sadler, bears a grudge against the victim from over a quarter of a century ago. However, using old photos of the group from their student days, Goodman wins his spurs and solves the case - though he is stunned when his wife rings to say she is leaving him.

 Here we go, gang! A little Kir Royal. Lovely! Well, here we are! Hello, everyone! Oh, here he is! Sorry, the, um... Well, the door was open, so I just... so I let myself in. Well, this is fun! But it's possible? Right? He could be having a... you know, a good time. At a party?

 Mm! Ah! Right then, Rich. What are you drinking? Any chance of a cup of tea or...? I'll get you one. Thank you. Put a sparkler in it, Sasha. 'But it's a reunion!' So? So it's his old college friends. And? And they'll be talking about the good old days, you know? When they were young and crazy and... And... And... 'And what?' 'And the stuff they did and the fun they had.' I really can't believe you're here. Sorry, could you excuse me, just for a moment? 'We could go up there and rescue him.' 'How?'

 Drive up there and say there's an emergency. Tell him that we found his sense of humour! 'I know, everyone!' Roger? Yup? Richard? Let's all play charades! Yeah! I'll get a paper and pen. Actually, I've, um... I've got a bit of a headache coming on. I think I'm going to just stop out here. Oh, come on, RP! Don't be such a bore! Come on, man! You can't sit outside all day! Dinner? Er... eat? Um, consume? Mud? Some brown... Mound? Chow? Scoff? Hill? Hill? Look, you're never going to get it. Angie's brain isn't wired the same as ours, is it, me old duck? Er, pancake? Look! Cutting... Er... er... Mound? Wiping it? Jamie's right. Ange, Ange, what is it? It's a pie! A pie? What was that bit? That bit was the lid of the pie, the pie lid, the pastry pie lid! Which film is pie? Life Of Pi! I got it ten minutes ago! Then why didn't you say something? And miss you swinging your arms around like a demented windmill? That was far more amusing. Thank you, Ange, but that is quite enough charades for me! Got a good mind to join old misery guts on the veranda there. He's been out there for an hour. He never liked party games. But still, it's not much of a reunion, is it? Even for RP, sitting on your own, reading a damn book! Come on! Who wants a cocktail? Ooh, I don't think I should. They're so strong. For Christ's sake, Ange! Lighten up! Come on, Ange! We owe it to our younger selves to get totally wrecked! What about Richard? He's missing all the fun. Nothing new there, then! Look, we've... We've taken him out some food and some drink. He'll be fine. Do your worst, barman! Certainly shall. Roger's making more cocktails. Would you like one? Mm! Where's the ice pick? It was here a second ago. Richard? Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. No, we still don't know when the body will be released. No, no, no, no. Of course not. And we will. I promise. OK, bye. His parents? Do we have anything new? Nothing from the door to door. And no-one could have approached by car because I checked the traffic CCTV camera at the bottom of the hill, which leads up to the house. We've got the chief's cab going up there at 4.50pm and then coming back down empty ten minutes later. The next car to go up there was ours. What about you guys? I'm going through the chief's current caseload. Nothing so far. And I'm still trying to see who's just been released from prison. Prison? Caseloads? We're wasting our time! Excuse me? I'm telling you. There's no way the killer was an intruder from outside. Come on! We've all seen that villa. The whole place is perched on the edge of a cliff. The only way out onto that veranda is from inside the house. OK! So we're back where we started again. Yes! The four people already at the house. University friends he hadn't seen in 25 years. Makes no sense. Good morning, team. Sir. Sir? So... I imagine it's difficult to think straight in the circumstances. A little, Sir. Yes. It, um... It occurred to me that you may need a little help. Any extra officers you can get over here... How about just one to begin with? Your new inspector. London speaks very highly of him. Hello! Hello! Morning. Commissioner. Morning. Well, at least I think it's morning. Are we in front or behind here? Er... Anyway, sorry if I'm late. Or... Or... Or early. Thank you. Team, may I introduce Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman? Dwayne, Fidel. Help the inspector in with his luggage. Yes, Sir. Thank you. This is Detective Sergeant Camille Bordey. It's a real pleasure to meet you, although I'm sorry it's not in better circumstances. This must be a terrible time for you all. Yes, it is. Sergeant Fidel Best and Officer Dwayne Myers. Sergeant Bordey, perhaps you will bring the inspector up to speed? Sir, it... Yes, sir. Inspector, if there's anything you need.... Thank you, Sir. Sir. Commissioner. Right. Er... This is me, is it? Um... Ah. Um, actually... This'll be great. Yes. Lovely. So where are these friends now? We moved them to a local hotel so we could preserve the crime scene. Excellent. OK. So we have Angela Birkett. She's a lawyer currently living in Bristol. Unmarried. Then we have husband and wife James and Sasha Moore. He's a financial advisor... ..and she ran her own computer software company. Ran, past tense? Yes. She sold the company seven years ago for a small fortune. And finally, we have Roger Sadler. Here alone, but married with three children. He's an estate agent. They all arrived on the island five days ago. And all of them went to university with the inspector? Yes, Sir. And you found the body where? Hot, isn't it? Could you bear to talk me through it? Um... The other guests were inside that room, playing games, according to their statements. Inspector Poole come out at 5.20pm with a book. He sat here. With his back to the house? Yes, Sir. Right. About an hour later, Angela Birkett came outside to ask if he wanted a cocktail. It was then that she found him, with an ice pick in his chest. OK. Forensics? The only prints we've managed to lift from the murder weapon all belong to the witnesses. All four of them? Yes, Sir. They all used the ice pick at one time or another. Anything else? Yes, Sir. We have an empty tea cup and an empty bowl with remnants of potato chips he was eating on the table. And the book was on the floor, which is a bit of a puzzle. How so? It was in French. The inspector didn't speak French? No. Mm. Right. You said they were playing games? Um, yes. Charades. Cocktails there. Cocktails. So Inspector Poole was pretty much in full view the whole time he was out there. And we're sure there's no other way out onto the veranda? Nope. You've got to come through the house. Ah. So in effect, any intruder would have had to pass the other guests as they played charades. And who took the statements? I did. Firstly to Sasha Moore, the lady in the blue... Where him gone? Right? Yeah, I was just... Carry on. OK, right. Um... I, er... I'd like background checks on those, er, old friends. Yes, we've done that. Police records, financial checks? Yes. Good, excellent. Er, you can fill me in later. Right. I think it's time we spoke to Richard's old chums, don't you? Thank you. Am I seeing things or did he fall out of the window? Um... yes. Yes, he did. The hotel is just around the headland. Right. Gosh, that takes some beating! What does? You're so beautiful. Sorry, IT is so beautiful! Not you, you're not. God, no! IT is. Beautiful. The sea and everything, palm trees, sand, the whole Caribbean vibe. Am I talking too much? Yes. Sorry. I do that a lot. It's the silence, you see. I always think it's my fault. Sally, my wife, says I have a pathological need to fill it. She's right, of course. She always is. She generally just puts a finger to my lips or says "Shut up", you know, so feel free to... either. You really don't want me here, do you? No. I'm not here to take his place, you know, Camille. I'm not here to be him. I don't expect anything, any consideration. I'm just here. And while I'm here, I promise I will do everything I can to find out what happened to your friend. Because that's what he was, not just your colleague. I'm sorry for your loss. I truly am. But the thing is, I have a feeling I may need some help, and a great deal of it. You can decide if you like me afterwards. And if I don't? Ah. Good point. Don't really have an answer for that. There's a whole list of things I'm not very good at. But I am a good detective. And right now, more than anything, I want to catch the person who murdered your friend. So maybe, just for now, it's enough that we both want the same thing. You're wet. Yes, I am. It will dry as we walk. Hello. Good morning. I'm sorry to put you through this again, but I'm DI Goodman. DS Bordey you already know. We just want to ask you a few more questions. Um, when can we all go back to the villa? And you are? I'm James Moore. And this is my wife, Sasha. Er, the villa is, er, still a crime scene, I'm afraid. We're moving as quickly as we can. I don't want to go back there. Angela? Roger Sadler. Look, um, we've given our statements. I'm not sure what else we can tell you. I take it you're not suggesting we're involved in any way? We haven't ruled out anything yet. Come on! We haven't seen the man for 25 years! I mean, I know he wasn't everyone's cup of tea, but why would any of us want him dead? We didn't even know he was on the island. But I thought this was a reunion. Yes, it is. Um, well, we always said we'd do a little something for our 25th anniversary. So why wasn't DI Poole invited? Well, none of us have really kept in contact with Richard since university. 'Until, that is, we were in your local market the other day, 'and there he was. Richard bloody Poole! I mean...' What are you all doing here? What an amazing coincidence. Yes! Wasn't it? Um... Then could I ask, er... Who organised the holiday? I did. And, um, out of all the possible holiday destinations in the world, why on earth did you choose Saint-Marie? Someone mentioned it to me when I was trying to set up the reunion. Was it you, James? You'd been here on a golf trip? Me? No. God, no. No, I'd... I'd never heard of this place. Oh, it must have been you, then, Sasha. Didn't you say you had your cosmetic surgery here? No, that was St Lucia, darling. And please don't give up a girl's secrets! Do you know what? I must've read about it, then, in a holiday supplement or something. Anyway, it stuck in my mind for some reason. So... So you bumped into Richard, invited him to your villa? I mean, it was a reunion we were having and, well, we didn't know he was here, but once we did, well... Well, how could we not? Indeed. So how come he ended up sitting alone on the veranda? It's no mystery. We wanted to play charades and he didn't. Got a bit of a headache. Oh, come on, RP! Don't be such a bore! 'And then over the next hour, I understand that, um, 'some of you went out to the veranda to see him.' 'I went to check that he was all right.' 'And he asked me for another cup of tea.' 'And then I think I took him out a bowl of crisps.' 'Then I took the tea out.' I'll just take the old boy this. 'How long were you outside for?' Half a minute. Just delivered the tea, really. Speak to him at all? Er, yes. I asked if he wanted to come and join the game. He, er... He said he'd rather not and, um... and then I went back inside. I think I was probably the last one out there. 'Yeah, I was doing the barbecue. 'I went out a couple of times to see if the coals were hot.' 'Did you talk to Richard?' 'No, no, anywhere near him. I was by the barbecue 'the whole, whole time.' You know, the truth is, the rest of us were always in that main room. There must have been an intruder. Someone must have got into that area unnoticed, somehow. Despite the fact that you weren't expecting to meet him here, once you had, I take it you all got along OK? Of course we did. Yes, yes. OK. I think that's all for now. Thanks for your time. Oh, just one more thing. That book he was reading, where did that come from? He brought that with him. He showed it to you, didn't he, Sasha? Yes, that's right. Ya. He, um... He said he picked it up from a book shop along the way. Strange thing to do, don't you think? Bring a book to a party? Well, not for Richard. Thank you. 'So the question is, ' what are the odds of booking a holiday 4,000 miles away, and a reunion, no less, then when you arrive, you discover someone you all happened to go to university with? Where are my notes? Ah! Thank you. So the point is... ..if any one of them knew Richard was in Saint-Marie, then it suggests that his 'murder was premeditated.' They wouldn't have sent him if he didn't know what he was doing. Fidel, we're talking about a man who fell out of a window! Yes, but... Yes, that is true. Well, look. You weren't too keen on Inspector Poole when he came out, either. We should just give him a chance. That's all I'm saying. Well, he's no chief, not in my book. Dwayne, no-one is going to take the inspector's place. Not for me. And if he was here, I know what he'd say. Me too. "Turn up the air con!" No. He'd tell us to be as professional as we can and to help the new inspector because that's why we're here. We're police officers. Mm-hm. We can grieve in our own time. Mm-hm. And to turn the air con up. You know what's really funny? What? And the new guy's just as... I think we have to rule out an intruder. If someone had managed to reach the villa unseen and they also somehow managed to commit murder in plain view of four witnesses and then escape, I don't believe it. Agreed. So we're left with four friends. Then if you haven't set eyes on someone for 25 years, how could you ever have a motive to kill them? Maybe they was all in it together. Possibly. But then I find the notion of four old university friends conspiring to travel all this way to murder someone after all this time, is just as unlikely as our ghostly intruder. Fox, goose and a bag of beans. I beg your pardon? The puzzle! Fox, goose and a bag of beans. Once upon a time, a farmer went to a market and he bought a fox, a goose and a bag of beans. But to get them home, he had to cross a river by boat. But the boat was so small it would only carry him and one of the things he bought. If he took the beans, the fox would eat the goose. If he took the fox, the goose would eat the beans. So how did he get them all across the river? Yes. Now, in our version, Angela Birkett went out first to ask him if he needed anything. He asked for a cup of tea. Then Sasha took him out a bowl of crisps. So assuming that Sasha would have noticed him being dead, we therefore have to accept that Angela didn't kill him. Then the crisp bowl being empty clearly suggests that he was alive to eat them after Sasha had left. So we must assume that she didn't kill him, either. Next out was her husband, James, who took him the cup of tea. Which was also drunk, so that means James didn't kill him, either. Unless Richard didn't drink the tea and the killer threw it away. No. Forensics showed traces of Richard's saliva in the cup. So he drank the tea after James left, leaving only Roger as a possible suspect. And yet, he's the only one of them who never went near Richard at any time. Or so he says. True. And then there's the damn book. Yes! Take the goose! You take the goose because the fox won't eat the beans! Yes. But then if he takes the fox out next, the goose will eat the beans. No, that's not right. If he takes the fox out next, it will eat the goose when he goes back for the beans. If he takes out the beans next, the goose will eat them when he goes back for the fox. The bottom line is none of them had a motive. It makes no sense. Ah. Oh, um... It was a long flight. I could really use a change of clothes. Does anyone know where I'm staying? We treated it as a secondary crime scene, so everything of Richard has been taken away. You know, I really wouldn't mind booking into a B&B; or something. It must be quite tough, having someone else stay here. A little, yes, but if you stay on Saint-Marie, this will be your home, so... Yes. Will your wife be coming? Sally? In a week or so, I think. Er, yes. She's had to hang on. We're renting out our house in the UK, so she's dealing with that. Yes, a bit of a loss without her, really. You must be. Er... There's an immersion heater for hot water. The switch is just beside it. Anything else, just ask. Quick shower and a change. Half an hour? I'll be outside. Better? Much better! There was a lizard in the bathroom. Harry. He comes with the house. Ah! Sitting tenant? He likes bugs smashed up with fruit. I'll do my best. This French novel Richard was supposedly reading, do you know it? Yes. Le Rouge Et Le Noir. We studied it at school. Le Rouge Et Le Noir. It's the story of, um... of a carpenter's son, Julien Sorel. He rises up through French society in the 19th century. It's a satire. Can you think of any reason why that would be of interest to Richard? No. And even if it was, he couldn't read French, so the book would have been useless to him. Then why take it to a party? Bonjour. Oh, hello. La poste pour Monsieur Poole. No, don't worry. I'll... I'll take it. It doesn't say who it's from. It's from the UK. Yeah. I wonder who sent it. Oh, Sir? I've had a preliminary report back from the pathologist. Ah. Right. Yes. It confirms what we already suspected. The ice pick entered the body through the third and fourth ribs. It punctured the right ventricle of the heart. Death would have been pretty instant. And the, er, background checks. You said you'd done them? That's right. We have. Now, Angela Birkett has her own law practice. She appears to be doing very well out of it. Roger Sadler is an estate agent based in Kent. He seems to be the least well-off. Now, Mr and Mrs Moore are worth a bomb. She sold her software company business in 2007 for 18 million! The Moores moved to Spain seven years ago after Mrs Moore was involved in a road traffic accident. Really? A bad one? Sasha Moore was fine but her sister, Helen Reed, was driving and she was killed. This is interesting. What is? It looks like his university album. Look, there's Sasha. The gang. Richard and Sasha again. There's James. And there's Richard. Angela Birkett is behind him, look. Hm. It's... I can't see Roger Sadler. Yes, it's their graduation photo. But why is it all here? Maybe he wanted to show his friends. Who sent it? Um... his mother. "Dearest Richard, hope what you're looking for is here. Love, Mum." "Hope what you're looking for is here." What was he looking for? Looks like his diary. Ah, well, that could tell us something important. I should read it. Sir, I've got something! There is a series of deleted e-mails to and from the UK from Angela Birkett. It looks like she's inviting him to their reunion, look. "Perhaps, if you don't want to come to the UK, "maybe I can persuade the others to come to Saint-Marie." So there was no coincidence. She knew he was here all along! She lied to us. Because I loved him. He was never interested in me, no matter how much of a fool I made of myself. With respect, doesn't explain why you lied to me. The others didn't know that Richard was here. It was bad enough at university. They were always teasing me, saying I was obsessed. They called me "Richard's little bunny boiler". If they knew I'd brought them all out here, just because... Well, it wouldn't have been a proper reunion, not without Richard! Um... Could you excuse me, just for a moment? 'You're saying you were never in a relationship with him?' 'He only ever had eyes for Sasha.' Sasha Moore? He helped her with her dissertation. You know, they were... They were rarely apart. Must have been quite some reunion when she saw him. Actually... 'I thought she was rather cool with him. 'I suppose it was probably for James's benefit.' James used to get a little bit jealous now and again but I think that's why he kept sniping at him. You know, he was arguing with him. Oh? The day we bumped into Richard, we... we all went to this place for lunch. 'I couldn't hear what they were saying. 'James said it was because Richard insisted on leaving 'a tip, even though the service was rubbish. 'But I... I just feel it was bound to be something about Sasha.' I'm sorry I lied. I didn't mean any harm. I really did love Richard. I couldn't have done anything to harm him. I really... I couldn't. You OK? It's so sad, you know, reading about someone's dreams, how they see their future, knowing that most of it will never happen. I miss him. I know. Ah! Dwayne said I'd find you here. Yes. This is my mother, Catherine. Maman, this is our new inspector. Humphrey. Enchante. Welcome to Saint-Marie. Thank you. And this is my mother's bar. Can I get you anything? Oh! Tea? Tea? Heavens, no! It must be 100 degrees! Um, I would like, please... Surprise me. May I? Of course. Thank you. Is there, er, anything in Richard's diary that might help us? Well, it seems that Richard was in love with Sasha Reed. They were just friends, right? That's what Angela Birkett said. Yes, they were. But it's clear Richard wanted more than that. And she also has a boyfriend. James Moore. Who hates their friendship. But Sasha always sticks up for Richard. And makes James hate him even more, I'd imagine. Sasha's sister, Helen, was a year below them. When Richard left, she told him he wasn't being fair with Sasha. He realised it was true and he decided he'd never see her again. Ah, Catherine! Thank you. Er... What is it? A rum made on the island. The locals swear by it. Mm, excellent! Um... No, your first drink is on me. Enjoy. Thank you. Well, bottoms up! No, you should... Camille. Sir. Yes, Fidel? So I spoke to the staff at the Palm Court, and there was a waitress who said she saw the argument between James and Richard. Go on. Well, the way waitress put it, um, James was being very aggressive and she heard the name Sasha. I think we need to speak to James Moore again, don't you? People really drink that? Well, I do. Right. Hello. Oh, for heaven's sake! How many times do we have to do all this? Only as long as it takes for you to tell us the truth. We have a witness who overheard the argument you had with Richard at the lunch and it wasn't about the tip, was it? Yeah, and while you're thinking about that, you can tell us about the relationship you had with him at university. Look, what is all this, eh? You resented the time he spent with Sasha. How the hell do you know that? Are you saying it isn't true? You know, he was like a fly. He was always buzzing around her. She wasn't remotely interested in him, of course, but the damn fool was infatuated with her. And it never went any further? Like I said, she wasn't interested in him. Then why, even after 20, 25 years, were you still jealous of him? That's what the argument was about, wasn't it? Sasha? I didn't take kindly to the way he was looking at my wife and I told him as much. Is that what you wanted? It's a start. All right. I admit it. I get twitchy when men look at Sasha. And when we all met up, I thought Richard was being over-familiar with her. It was like being back at university and I... I just snapped. You just leave Sasha alone! You seem to be an intelligent man, Inspector. Do you seriously believe that I would murder a policeman because of the way he was looking at my wife? I don't trust him. Nor do I. Doesn't mean he's our killer. Yes, then who is? I saw you talking to James. Yes. He's a good man. He just gets angry sometimes. And jealous? OK. Richard and I... Richard was... ..funny. You know, eccentric. He was one of my best friends. But I never felt the way he did. You know, it's funny. It's only now that he's gone... ..that I realise how much I've been missing him. Anyway... ..I just wanted to tell you about James. Crisps. Cup of tea, cup of tea, tea. 'Hi, you're through to Sally. I'm not here right now 'but please leave a message and I'll get back to you.' Hello, my darling. Here safe. At least I've hit the ground running, so there's no time for jet lag yet. People are nice and, er, it is very beautiful. Love you. Bye-bye. OK, well, thank you very much for that. That was the dean's secretary at the university they all attended. It bugged me as to why Roger Sadler is not in the graduation photograph, so she pulled his file for me. And? Simple. He never graduated. Roger was thrown out of university. What for? Cheating in his exams. And it gets better. He was reported to the dean by Richard Poole. You looking for me? Yes, we are. We understand that you were thrown out of university for cheating on your exams. It's a matter of public record. Why bring it up now? You didn't think to tell us? I hardly see how it's relevant! It's relevant because it was Richard who reported you, wasn't it? Is that true? You really expect us to believe you didn't know? Well, I didn't. Well, it was... 25 years ago. I honestly had no idea. Now, if you don't mind... You're lying! I beg your pardon? We've got Richard's diary. He's written about how you cheated, how he confronted you and you begged him not to tell, didn't you? I can arrest you and you can read it for yourself at the police station if you prefer. Yes, all right, all right! Richard wouldn't listen. I... I pleaded with him not to, but he went to the dean anyway. And in that very moment, my life was ruined. When I was booted out of Cambridge, I felt my life had come to an end and maybe I'd have happily killed him then. But that was a quarter of a century ago. I've moved on since then. Look, if you really think I'm the killer, then arrest me. But first you going to have to prove to me how I'm supposed to have done it. I've got three witnesses who say I never went near him in his bloody chair all night! None of that was actually in Richard's diary, was it? No. Rouge Et Le Noir... ..Speak French... It's getting late. You should get some sleep. We're so close. We have to be! And yet, WHY did he have to die? Well, good night, Sir. Yes. Good night, Camille. 'Hi, you're through to Sally. I'm not here right now 'but please leave a message and I'll get back to you.' OK, everyone. We are missing something. Means. All four of them had access to the murder weapon. Doesn't help. Opportunity. Um, they all went out onto the veranda at one point or another. Doesn't help, either, but at least neither means nor opportunity rules any of them out. Which brings us back to the one thing we keep coming back to. Motive. Yes, but do we really believe someone waited all that time to kill him? We don't believe there was an intruder, either. No. Then something must have happened after they arrived in Saint-Marie, something that provided a motive. You know what really confuses me? Why kill him at the villa? And why that night? The man lives in a shack on a beach, miles from anyone. Why not kill him there? You're right! He was murdered at a party. It's as though the killer felt they had no choice, that Richard Poole had to die that evening! Why? Perhaps he was about to expose one of them. Yes! That's it! That's it! A ticking clock! He knew something, didn't he? Or, at the very least, suspected it. That's why he sent home for these things. He believed that something in here would confirm what he discovered. But what? Come on! Right. There's a flight into Paris leaving at three and a connecting flight into London. They've got seats if we want them. What about the police? Well, we've answered all their bloody questions. They can't stop us from going home. Come on. Ange? Come on. I've just spoken to a clerk at Angela Birkett's law practice. Took a little bit of the old Dwayne love dust, but she told me that Angela hasn't been in any kind of relationship since she started there eight years ago. What is the "Dwayne love dust"? Don't ask! The police report from the traffic accident that Sasha Moore was involved in, Sir. Seems like a lorry had a puncture, swerved into two lanes. Her sister was driving, but there was nothing she could do. Helen was killed instantly. OK. Thanks, Fidel. And only Roger Sadler and Angela Birkett had social network sites. Bit about the reunion but... OK! Enough of the information overload! Let's keep it simple. The mementos. Why did he need the stuff he sent for? And the book. Come on! Why take a book to a party? What was he up to? It's like he's testing us. Yes, well, you know, that would be the chief all over, Sir. 'And the book was on the floor, which is a bit of a puzzle. 'It was in French.' Testing! It looks like things from his time at university. 'Haven't seen the man for 25 years!' He helped her with her dissertation. But no, of course! Of course! Testing us! Honore Police Station? Bloody hell! You got something? That was the hotel, the reunion party's checking out. What?! We need to stop them! Yes! Stop them! Fidel. Look at this. What am I looking at? Name at the top. Got the who, just need the how. Where's the Jeep? Huh? There's no Jeep? Camille took it. What do we do, then? Oh... no! Splendid! Lovely. Splendid. Got it. What are they all doing here? This is the part where you expose the killer. In front of everyone? It's how Richard did it. Really? Yes. Look, can someone tell us what the bloody hell is going on, because we all have a plane to catch. We've answered all your questions. Ah, no, you've answered some of them. Some I haven't asked yet. Sorry. You know, bizarrely, I'm the only one who never met Richard Poole. But during this case, I... I feel as though I've got to know him... a little. Mostly by the effect he had on those around him. But it seems we all forgot one very crucial thing... he was a detective. A good one. I think he made a discovery, had a theory about what he discovered and then sent home for evidence to corroborate that theory. And in doing so, he has in essence... solved his own murder. You know, the biggest problem we had was establishing a motive. Why kill someone you haven't seen for 25 years? It... it simply can't be any of us, we were in sight of each other the whole time! Apart from Roger when he went out to light the barbecue. Now... now hold on a second, I didn't bloody kill anyone, I didn't go anywhere near him. No, you didn't. What? I said you didn't kill Richard Poole. Oh, right, good. Thank you. Then there were three. I can't bear this! I've told you all I know, I wouldn't have hurt Richard, you all know that! I-I-I... I loved him. And I believe you. And then there were two. You see... it was a little like the goose, the fox and the beans... working out who did what, when... and in what order. First, Angela checked he was all right. Why don't you come in, Richard, it'll be fun? She asked him if he wanted another cup of tea. But when she left him, we believe he was still alive. Then a little later, you took him out his bowl of crisps. Remind me... who was it who suggested playing charades that night? It was you, wasn't it, Sash? It might have been. Why? Why, because it was well known Richard hated playing games, so how better for his killer to isolate him from the group. Yes, you needed him to be on his own away from the others, didn't you? So that you could murder him. No. No! That can't be right. Richard was still alive when Sasha came back inside. H-H-He drank the tea, he ate the food. Not quite, cos Sasha had an accomplice. James. What?! Angela... ..when Richard asked you for another cup of tea, did you take the old cup back into the house? I don't think so. Cos you did, didn't you? When you took him out his crisps. And you didn't take him out a new cup of tea, did you? You took him out the old one. I'll just take His Lordship this. All done to establish an alibi... for your wife. You see the "how"...was reasonably easy, once we knew that one of you committed the murder, but it was the "why"...the "why" that was the most elusive. Why would anyone kill an old friend they hadn't seen for 25 years? In fact, by this logic, Sasha was our least likely suspect. After all, she and Richard were best mates in college. But that's how... that's how I knew it had to be you who wielded the ice pick. Richard Poole wasn't killed by an old friend as we've been thinking all along. He was killed by a relative stranger. What are you talking about? Because you're not Sasha Moore... ..you're Helen Reed... her sister. Only one year separated two sisters, Sasha and Helen Reed. Both attended the same university. In the police file from the road traffic accident you were both involved in, there's a police report showing an earlier conviction for shoplifting. Which was around the time Sasha founded her computer software company. Unlike her, you were unemployed, you had no money. And even years later, after your much more successful sister sold her company for a small fortune, you were still struggling. What happened after that car accident? Two sisters both injured, one fatally. Was there some confusion about who was who? Did someone ask you if you were Sasha? Was the opportunity just too good to miss? Had the affair with her sister already started? Or did it begin once she got control of your dead wife's fortune? This... is the real Sasha. Full of life and joy, about to marry her college sweetheart, James. And this is you. You already looked a bit like your sister, but helped on with a touch of cosmetic surgery... Didn't you say you had your cosmetic surgery here? No, that was St Lucia, darling. None of you had seen each other for years, so when Angie called up and asked you to attend the reunion, you thought you'd be able to get away with it. Until you bumped into Richard. What are you all doing here?! Yes, Richard, not only a detective, but someone who knew the real Sasha better than all of you. I think he was on to you from the start. It's no wonder you were cold with him, you hardly knew him at all. And when you lost your temper with him, you were not being jealous, you were simply trying to prevent him from speaking to Sasha. In the end there are two pieces of damning evidence. This is the book Richard brought with him that night. You said you hadn't read it. I haven't read it. Which is rather the point. This is a photograph taken from the box Richard sent home for. I believe it's a photograph celebrating Sasha's dissertation. It's very hard to see with the naked eye, but... if you look closely, you can see a copy of the finished dissertation in front of Sasha. Le Rouge Et Le Noir. Which is why Richard was holding a book we know he couldn't read, he brought it with him that night as a final test to confirm his suspicion that you were not the Sasha he knew. Found it in the market. Do you know it? No... I don't know it. When you realised Richard Poole was on to you... He knows. ..you decided to kill him. Trust me, he knows. I'll do it. All of which... I suppose, may be regarded as circumstantial... ..until we see this. Helen Reed's shoplifting conviction. The prints on this match the exclusion prints you gave us after the murder, leading me to make only one conclusion, which is why Richard had to die and he had to die that evening. You had to protect your secret. Richard? Sorry about that. Brilliant! Madame. Nice one. Thanks. He'd still be alive, wouldn't he, if I hadn't brought her here? Well done, sir. Well done to all of us, Fidel. I'm sure the Inspector would've been proud of you. Yes, I'm sure he would have. There is just one thing still bothering me. Yes? The fox, the goose and the bag of beans. Ah! Well, you see, you take the goose over first and then go back for the beans... Yes, but then won't the goose eat the beans when you go back for the fox? No. And here's the clever bit. When you go back for the fox, you take the beans with you. I'm sorry, you take the goose with you. I think. Well, I'd better start writing up my report. Ah, erm... where are all my bits of... paper and stuff. Erm... I put them on your desk, Sir. Oh. Good night. Yes, er... yes, good night, Camille. Only the Chief could have solved his own murder. Just so you know, his body has been released, they'll fly him home tomorrow. He was a good man. Well, if he's going home, I say we have a remembrance service right here tonight. I'm going to remember him till I fall over. Taxi! To the Chief! Where you going? It's the Commissioner's round! I'll be back! Sir. We were having a drink... come and join us. That's really sweet of you, but er... I shouldn't. Why not? Well, you all need to spend a bit of time to say goodbye to Richard in your own way. It'd be a bit awkward if I was there. I need to unpack. If I can find a taxi. OK. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye, Camille. 'Hello, Humph, it's me. 'God, I usually hate these things, but now I'm rather pleased you're not there. 'Look, The thing is, Humph, I... Well... I'm not coming. 'I never was. 'And I know I should have had this conversation before you left, 'but I'm a terrible coward and this just seemed... 'Look, the thing is... I don't love you any more, not really. 'So there, I've said it. 'And I'm so sorry, I truly am! 'And this... this may well turn out to be the biggest mistake of my life, but it's how I feel. 'You'll be OK, won't you, Humph?' Action! The day she's satisfied is the day she dies. Right. Thea! Call an ambulance! A stand-in was killed after only a few weeks on a film set. It's my fault she was out here. This is not the not the act of a writer. Your wife... she arrives tomorrow. Yes, of course. Stop the car! Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru.
