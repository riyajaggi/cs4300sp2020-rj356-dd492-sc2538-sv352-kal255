 Did I wake you? Thank God you're alive. I've been wanting to do this for months. See they don't let you do your nails up in Manticore either. No respect for the girlie arts, that place. I had to torch it. No doubt. So Manticore and 'em got all irate, cos Eyes Only put salt in their game? - Oh, yeah. - And they sent you to take the brother out? But instead you burned the place up and let everybody out. - Needed some get-back. - Right. So what's with this virus they put in you so that you and Logan can't touch?

 - They're just mean like that. - No, boo. I think they sent you to kill Logan cos he's Eyes Only. - Logan? Please. - Straight up. Now it all makes sense. - You two were always doin' stuff on the DL. - You got it all wrong. Sugar, don't front. You been creepin' with Eyes Only. - Gimme some. - You can't say anything though. I already forgot. You got Original Cindy's word. Many people want him dead. I almost got him killed. It's going to be aiight. It's all good. It doesn't feel all good. It doesn't even feel a little bit good. Somehow, someway, it's all gonna come correct. Cos you and Logan just got it like that. Nothing can keep you two apart. You're home, you're safe, you're strong. You kicked Manticore to the curb for good.

 They can't hurt you any more. They can't hurt anyone any more. We need to keep movin'. If Manticore's under attack, they'll be lookin' for us to remobilise. Right there. There it is. The rendezvous signal. - I don't know about this. - We're supposed to regroup. But the other night, the fire... No one let us out of the barracks. Maybe they were busy defending the facility. Manticore was under attack. Command is someplace or there wouldn't have been a signal. - But the TACs, they were shooting at us. - They were protecting the perimeter. I mean, sure, we took some friendly fire, that's all. Come on. We've still got ten clicks to cover. There they are. We're goin' home. X6-314 reporting for duty, sir. At ease, soldier. They designed her to be the perfect soldier, a human weapon. Then she escaped. In a future not far from now, in a broken world, she is haunted by her past. She cannot run. She must fight to discover her destiny. Police suspect foul play in a fire that claimed as many as 100 lives last Friday. Authorities won't release information on the fire's origin and any loss of life. We can't even get music in this damn place. Why can't we just go back to LA? Because LA is full of freaks and weirdos and psychos. Look out! Whoa. - What are you doing? - Goin' back to LA. So, what should I tell everybody? Let a sister handle this. Original Cindy's gonna get out in front of this thing. Hey, everybody! Look who's back from the dead. All right. Max. Almost scared me to death. This is a joyous turn of events. Now, what happened? Well, well, well. Look who's here. What can I say, Normal? Rumours of my death had been greatly exaggerated. - Hot run - Everclear. - Got my name on it. No. No, your name is mud, missy-miss. I've heard some lame excuses for missing work, but faking your own death for a three-month sabbatical is a new low. I did not fake my own death. I had a medical emergency. - Would you care to explicate? - A heart transplant. Ah, that's good. Have you got a note from your doctor or a prescription for cyclosporine perhaps? Because I'll need some more proof before I buy that... That's a nice big, uh... scar you got there. Yeah, well, enjoy it while you can, cos it's fading fast. - Can I use your phone? - What about the package? - I'll get to it. - It's like she never left. Me, hittin' you back. What's up? Embers cool and the death toll rises after Monday's tragic blaze - at Mountainside Veterans Hospital. - Have you seen this on Channel Three? Hey, Sketch, hook me up on three. Channel Three News has learned the inferno was the result of arson, traced to rogue terrorist group S1W. - Manticore. - Only they're blaming S1W. Is that a bad thing? And what's the S1W? It's a progressive group fighting the good fight. They're into direct action, so the government paints them as terrorists. Better people think some crackpots torched the VA than the freaks got out. The S1Wheld hostages in a VA facility last month. This is so bogus. Eyes Only said that hospital's a front for that Manticore place. Mountainside burst into flames... They claim a lot of people died in that fire. The S1W is being framed for murder. Nothin' I can do about it. And why do you care so much about this S1-whatever? Some friends of mine are involved. Done stuff for Eyes Only. Look, forget I mentioned it. It's my problem. Can you come over later? Given the givens, I'm not sure if it's a good idea. It'll be OK. Just come. I've got some information for you and I'm still putting it together, but... it could be important. I'll swing by. The death toll is expected to rise. Ooh, mutants on the loose. The genetically superior walk among us. They said that everybody died, fool. We thought Max was dead too, and yet here she is, good as new. Gotta jet. - Gotta make Eyes Only get the truth out. - I can't make him do anything. They're pinning this on us cos of the job we pulled at the VA office. That was a favour to you. Now I need a favour. Talk to him. This is so cool. Does it say how much you cost? A lot more than you, sweetheart. - Is it a gang thing? - Now you guessed my secret. So how come you're not out gangbanging, then? Oh, cos sometimes a guy can have a lot more fun on his own. - Mm, so you're on the lam. - Oh, you're so intuitive. Hey, why don't you go grab us something to eat? - Will ya? - OK. OK. - I'm starving. - Me too. If I don't get something to eat soon, I'm gonna kill somebody. They're not gonna give us food - not without money. I'm goin' in. A bar code? What does it mean? Means it's ours. Hey, where'd you guys get those? My friend has one just like that. That's it. Let's go. Hey! Hold it. I said, hold it! Get the money! Do it! Great. That's just great. Possible sighting Echo Golf 4-2-7-8. - How many? - Six or seven. All right, send a unit to check it out. White. Handle it. We don't want local law enforcement. The idea is to keep this mess under wraps. Well, tell them they can shove their jurisdiction, that this is a federal matter. Tally on the signalling operation. 38 showed up at the rendezvous point over the day. Not bad. Keep the signal running every night till they stop coming. Sir. - What is that? - Something made to fight in the desert. Skin's designed to retain moisture. Even has a second eyelid, probably to protect the cornea against sand and grit. I hate to think how many of those rolled off the assembly line. - They bring it in? - X7s, sir. - Manticore uses them to guard the perimeter. - I read the reports. They've got some kinda hive-mind thing goin'. - Communicate ultrasonically, in digital code. - Ship it out in the next transport. I want Forensics to take it apart for analysis. Get it outta here. Them too. Get it out! It's about time. Share your rations. Slow down. Daddy's home. - X6-787, sir. - X6-809, sir. Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. What are you bozos thinkin' - knockin' over a quickie mart? - Sir? - I had a very sweet deal goin' and you blew it. - What's that doin' here? - He escaped the attack with us. - The attack? - On Manticore. Command's re-established. We saw the signal to regroup. The rendezvous is six clicks from here, south-southwest. - We were about to move out. - I hate to say this, but Manticore was not attacked. They tried to barbecue us. Sir? They're trying to kill us. The signal's bogus. It's a trap. If I may, sir, that doesn't make any sense. We're valuable military assets, representing billions of dollars in R&D.; - Why would Manticore try to get rid of us? - I want to get rid of ya, and I just met ya. We should go. They're waiting. OK, what part of "They're trying to kill you" did you not understand? Sir, officers of rank superior to yours left orders to regroup when instructed to do so. Far be it from me to violate the chain of command. - Fall in. - You're really gonna do this? - Didn't you hear me, soldier? - He heard you. He just can't believe his ears. I'm gonna have to report you. Both of you. You do that. Left face. Quick march. Hey. - Hey. - You said you had something for me. Yeah. Come see. We shouldn't get too close. The virus. Apparently there's a massive military action in the woods around Manticore. Same thing happened in '09. By the time they got their act together, we'd gone. There's a difference. You escaped because you wanted out. They ran for their lives. They may not even realise Manticore wanted them dead. This mean anything to you? Got it from an informant lives out that way. Real conspiracy buff. - Obsessed with UFOs. - It's a signal from Manticore. We were trained to look for it in case the facility was compromised. - What does it say? - Regroup. Echo Golf 4-2-7-9-5-2. Friday. Today. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you goin'? - Logan, they tried to kill them. - Now they want to finish the job. - They could be shipping 'em to a new facility. - See? That doesn't work for me either. - Fine. You wanna go out and save the day, what's the plan? - Don't know yet. - Max. This is happening because of me. I forced them to go. That's my family. Some are screwed up. Some don't look like anything anybody has ever seen before. But I'm responsible for them just the same. - Hey. - Careful. Now, see, you took the word right outta my mouth. Run! Hey, weird kid. Want some hydrogenated, imitation-pork product? All right. More for me. - Sir, you were right. It was an ambush. - They shot at us. If you idiots let them follow you... - Oh, great. - Is it them? I wish. Give me something to tie his leg off with. - What are you doing here? - Was about to ask you the same thing. I'd kick your ass, but we don't have time for that right now. The bullet went through. We must cauterise. - Why were they shooting at us? - He's going into shock. - Get something to keep him warm. - I think I'm gonna be sick. Bet that one flunked Field Med. - Go. - I won't lie. This is gonna hurt like hell. Agh! Hang on, hang on. It's almost over. OK, it's done. Hey, you're gonna be OK. Yeah, so long as we get him and the rest of these kids outta here. What do you mean "we"? This is your party, not mine. Help me to understand how a girl on a motorcycle got the drop on you and all of your men. It's hard to explain, sir. It all happened so fast we... Sorry. I thought you'd want to see this. It was retrieved from the Manticore site. - Belonged to Director Renfro. - On the desk. A database. Good. - Well, well. - What is it, sir? The DNA workup of an X5. Not bad-lookin' for a freak. Sir. Sir, that's her. That's the girl on the motorcycle. - You sure? - Yes, sir. Don't just stand there. Find her. All right, people, fall in. There's been a change in your mission status - extreme and unforeseen. You've been betrayed by your command. What do you do? - Redeploy. - Correct. How? We have no training with regard to that circumstance. - Do you know what that means? - No, ma'am. All your training goes out the window. Starting with your blind obedience to Manticore. - Yes, ma'am. - Which means, stop calling me ma'am, - and start calling me Max. - Yes, ma'am. Yes, Max. That's my name. And now you're in the real world, you all should have names too. - Oh, for the love of... - Shut up. You must stop thinking of yourselves as soldiers and think of yourselves as people. - But we are soldiers. - You mouthin' off to me? Because I've zero tolerance for that. Zero. And to commemorate this special moment, that's gonna be your name. Zero. Get out on sentry duty. - Saw you messin' around with that radio. - I excelled in Diagnostics and Repair. - I was trying to fix it. - Fixit. That's gonna be your name. And that's what you're gonna do with that ol' pick-up over there. Fix it. You're the girl that threw up? You could always call her Ralph. Ralph. I like it. - It's a boy's name. - I still like it. Ralph it is, then. Go check on Bullet. - Who's Bullet? - The kid that got shot. - That yours? - I'm in the bugle corps. Bugler it is. - What's my assignment? - Getting some sleep. - It's not lights out yet. - It's OK. Let's find a place for you to bunk down. What about him? Doesn't he need a name? I'll leave that to you, since you two seem to be getting along so well. - Where's White? - Sir, this is a restricted area. Tell him Lydecker's here to see him. - I'll have to ask you to wait here a moment. - Sorry. This is urgent. Command, there's someone here from Manticore. Name's Lydecker. He identified himself? What the hell was he thinking? Damn it! - Hello. - It's Lydecker. - How did you get this number? - Never mind that. I need you to help me get in touch with Max. - What for? - I can't tell you that. Do you know where she is? - Somewhere in the woods outside Manticore. - He'll be lookin' for her. - He? Who's he? - If you hear from her... tell her to get outta there as fast as she can. Satellite's in range, sir. - Try to take your weight off it. - I'm fine, Ralph. Would you cut it out? X8-621 is ready to commence training, ma'am. Your name's Bugler, remember? And there's not gonna be any training today. - There's not? - No. Not ever again. Really? Really. See, you don't have to take orders any more. Not from anyone. - Not even you? - Especially not from me. Well, when the goin' gets cute, the tough get goin'. You're really leaving? Afraid so. Figures you'd forget the one good thing they taught us: "Never abandon your unit." Well, thanks to you, there is no more Manticore. You made this mess. Not me. Are you sure this girl was with 'em? See for yourself. Let me position the mike. OK, they're downloading. The computer's translating the ultrasound signals, reconstructing a sonic image relayed to them by the X7 inside. Now we convert the sonic image into a visual one. Let me see if I can enhance it. - That's pretty much what she looks like. - That's her. Take her alive if you can. OK, Zero, hit it. Nice work, Fixit. Just give me a few more minutes to adjust the timing. Max! Soldiers outside. Get away from the window! You too! Someone's been talking out of school. Tie him up. We're leaving him here. Fixit, we gotta go now! What the hell? Why use smokers? I thought they wanted us dead. Me too. Come on, hurry up. I want all units to advance. Approach pattern - Omega 13. As soon as it starts, get the hell out. That's an order! Go. You heard what she said. Move it! Foxtrot One to Command. We have her, sir. - Say again, Foxtrot One. - We have X5-452. Sorry. I, uh... didn't know somebody else was in here. You don't look so hot. Probably need some sun, huh? Bet they had you all hooked up back at Manticore. Nice sandy barrack. Heat lamps. Sorry. Ugh! I hate those things. You want it? Yes? No? Nice move. Having a little family reunion? You must be the new bad guy in my life. You know, 452, you're much prettier than in your picture. Gee, miss the old bad guys already. I had a chance to peruse the DNA workup done during your recent stay at Manticore. Let me guess. My insurance didn't cover it and you want me to go outta pocket. Are you familiar with the term "junk DNA"? Layman's terms for base pairs that don't contain viable genetic information. Doesn't do much more than fill space. Kinda like that grey, squishy thing in between your ears. Would you be surprised if I told you that you didn't have any junk DNA? It seems every single base pair is coded for some specific genetic purpose. Now, the money question is, what does it mean? What is it that your genes are coded to do? Kick ass, mostly. After that, wouldn't know. Well, not to worry, cos we're gonna find out. I can't believe we left her there after all she did for us. She gave us a direct order. She told me we don't have to take orders any more. Not from anyone, not even her. - That's good enough for me. - Me too. - I'm in. - Let's do it. They're headin' the wrong way. Hey, you're headin' the wrong way! Typical. - Satellite's in range, sir. - Line her up. Let me guess. She got herself caught saving your butts. Pretty much. All right. Well, let's get this over with. Keep at it. I'm gonna find out what the hell's goin' on. - Alec. - To the rescue. You still wanna kick my ass? Maybe later. Hurry up. Him too. - Are you kidding? - Do it. - All right. - It's gonna be OK. We're gonna get you outta here. Go, go. - You're welcome. Come on, let's go. - Wait. The laser show's still going. You wanna be the hero, you can't be half-assed about it. Let's go. All those stars kinda make you feel small and insignificant, huh? We got a security breach. The perimeter has been compromised. - What is it? - That's not the signal to regroup. - It's a signal to scatter and go to ground. - White to all units. Disable the signal now. It's done. Trash it. Come on. We gotta get outta here. Go, go. IDs and passports to get you across the border to Canada. Are we ever going to see you again? Promise. Now, I'm gonna drop a little wisdom on you grunts, so pay attention. First time I got out in the world, I lost track of all the kids I escaped with. Spent the next ten years tryin' to find 'em. Don't let that happen to you. Stay together. You're family. - I'm outta here before the waterworks start. - Hold on. We have one last thing to do. - As soldiers. - And what's that? Pay our respects to those who didn't make it. Attention! - Thanks for comin' through on their papers. - No problem. You did a good thing, Max. Not just for them, but for all of 'em. They'll figure it out. So, you headin' back into town? Yeah, I'll take a ride. Clear my head. I look at Logan and I wanna take my own advice and stay together. But how are we supposed to do that, when his life depends on us staying apart? Who knows? Maybe we can beat this thing. I guess we'll just have to see where this road takes us.
