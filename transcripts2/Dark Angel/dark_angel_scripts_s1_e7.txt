 Dark Angel (2000â€“2002): Season 1, Episode 7 - Blah Blah Woof Woof - full transcript 
 Now that Lydecker has seen her face, Max is on a Wanted poster all over town for a murder she didn't commit. The temptation of the big reward leads even her own boss, Normal, to give her up to the police. Zack and Logan help her escape to Logan's cabin located outside of Seattle. However, when Max learns that Logan's condition has worsened and that he's undergoing a very dangerous surgery, she risks her life to come to the hospital. Logan has lost a lot of blood and the blood bank runs out of AB negative blood. Max gives Logan a transfusion as she is a universal donor, something Manticore had given her and the rest of her brothers and sisters. The transfusion works but she is soon captured by authority. Just as all hope seems lost, Zack shows up and takes responsibility for the murder. She is freed but he is taken back to Manticore.

 Finally. She beats a retreat in the face of the Sicilian gambit. Check. Nuh-uh. It's not checkmate. It can't be. 'Fraid so. OK. So, uh... that's four games to you? - Five. - Right. Five. Isn't it against the superhero code to use your powers to take advantage of mere mortals? Yeah. And I'm not done taking advantage either. There's a stunt contest at Crash tonight.

 Thinkin' about pullin' a Linda Blair, ridin' my bike on the ceiling or somethin'. - Wanna come? - No. Thanks. Oh. I forgot. No fun for Logan Cale. The world's comin' to an end. Fight the power, protect the downtrodden... Blah blah, woof woof. See ya. Raise the forehead a little bit. Thin out the eyebrows. Make the cheekbones a little rounder. Not so defined. And the lips... fuller. - Fuller? - You heard me. Perfect. This reward you're offering. It's a hell of a lot of money. Mr Vogelsang was a valued operative. We'll do everything we can to find his killer. - What if the girl goes to ground? - I don't think she will.

 She'll run if she's smart. She'll try and get the hell out of the city. She'll have to get past our checkpoints. This is where my men are. I'd like one of these on every wall, every window and every lamppost in the city. With this kind of money involved, every nutcase in this town is gonna be more than happy to turn in his nearest and his dearest just for his cut. Besides, this is gonna take a lot of extra manpower. But, you know, with the financial straits that the city's in... The agency appreciates your predicament. Thank you, sir. Uh... then you understand where I'm coming from. Completely. I think I can help you. You tryin' to elicit a bribe from a federal agent? - No, sir. - Good. Because sometimes, when you grease the palm, it makes the fingers slippery. Sir, you have the complete cooperation of my department. It's 100 per cent at your disposal. All right, then. You're dismissed. That was one badass endo you spiked last night. - How much did you win, anyway? - 75 bucks. Damn, girl! Next time my paper's on you. - Hey. - Hey, take it outside. What did I say would happen if I caught you peepin' again? I can't help it, Max. You so the bomb. Kaboom. Pervo. No roughhousing on the premises. We're not insured for it. - South Market Street? - Yeah. I hope you're packin'. - Wanna have lunch? - Yep. - Meet you here at noon? - Cool. ID? - Hey, Jerry. - What's up? - Look at this. - C'mon, guys. - Girl's trying to earn a living here. - Yeah, it's forged. Definitely. - Jim. - Yeah. - You're going downtown, pal. - What do you mean, downtown? - I got the damn pass downtown. - Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I'm just saying it sorta looks like her. That paper speaks of wicked things. Max is a righteous woman with no malice in her heart for no one. I know my girl. She's a badass, straight up, but not a killer. I'm not sayin' she killed anybody. Just that I see a resemblance. No, no. What you think you seein' is the 50 large reward in your pocket. But you better get your eyes right or you'll see Original Cindy puttin' the smackdown. Hey, let's go, people. Lots of lovely packages here cryin' out for a home. Move. Where the fire truck is Max? I ain't seen her. Probably wouldn't recognise her if I did. - What are you hidin' back there? - Nothin'. Get outta my sight. Come on, Logan. Answer. - Hey. - Here, Sam, let me start you off. "Logan, I've got some bad news." After the shooting, we didn't remove one of the bullet fragments. - It was lodged so close to your spine. - It would've been too risky. Unfortunately, the fragment has migrated. That's what's causing the spasms. It's impacting on your spinal cord. If we don't get it out of there, it could keep moving and cause more damage. - Worst-case scenario? - You could end up quadriplegic. Maybe even on a respirator. - Looks like I'm going under the knife again. - Operating in that area, it's risky. You've got three major arteries, they're right there, so there's the chance of bleed-out. Removing that fragment could result in nerve damage as well, though probably not as severe as if we do nothing and further migration occurs. So... - Let's do it. - OK. I'll set it up for tomorrow morning. - Thanks, Doc. - Get some rest. Yeah, she's a killer, all right. - Check it out. - Hey, baby. You got the time? Cos I got the place, you know what I'm sayin'? Now, don't be shy. I was... Hey. Yeah, you. - Come here. - What is it, Officer? Oh, no. Not her again, man. She's been dissin' me all day. I got stopped twice already. Come on! She doesn't even look like me. Look how thin she is. Can you say "eating disorder"? - Whoa! It is her, man. - Boo! This is Kirby, downtown zero-seven. She's on South Market. - A confirmed sighting on South Market. - How confirmed? She took out a policeman with no sweat. All tac units, this is Command. Target is known to be in South Market. Establish airtight perimeter, and start site-to-site search. Box her in... and box her in fast. Step back! To the storage area! Get out! Move! Yeah, he coughed up the juice. Had to break his thumb first, but hey. Hey, hold on. I gotta whiz. He's gonna have to call you back. Sketchy, get over here. I need you to man the desk. - Me? - Yes. I have something important to do. - You got a nerve, showin' your face. - Where's Max? She didn't come back from her morning run. Imagine that. I had high hopes for you, but you turned out to be like all the rest - just a great big fat goose egg. - Cindy. - Well, what have we got here? - I'm looking for Max. - Welcome to the club. - Yeah. - It's me. Max. Uh! - Max, it's Zack. - Who? - What are you doing there? - Never mind. We gotta get you out of town. Would somebody tell me what's goin' on? Knock, knock. You shouldn't leave your window open if you don't want visitors. So I've been told. What brings you back to Seattle? Think I'd let Max take the rap for somethin' I did? Control, this is Delta 4. No sign of her yet. Roger, Delta 4. Turn the place inside out. Evacuate if you have to. I want her found. Logan, no need to convince me. You say she didn't do it, fine. - But I can tell you no one has picked her up. - Great. So what's the situation down there? Every crank in the city is angling for the reward money. Last I heard, they're closing in on a suspect in South Market. OK. See if you can run interference for me. I'll try, but I'm just one guy. Appreciate anything you can do. Let him through. Have you seen this woman? Have you seen anyone who looks like her? - Good luck. - There's no such thing. Success depends on a well-thought-out plan that's executed with precision. Right. Until further notice, all places of business and vehicles are subject to search. - Mr Ronald? - Yep. That's me. I just wanna say I admire the work you fellas do, keeping the streets safe for average citizens. - I understand you have some information? - Right. Got it. Business at hand. Yes. Uh, I'm reachin' out to do you guys a solid on this female perp. - Excuse me? - This skell, who works for me. - Jam Pony, and her name is Max. - Let's not tell the whole world. - Not with 50 large on the line. - Hey, I'm not doin' this for the reward. - How much did you say it was? - Maybe you'd better come with me. All set? Would I have come back here if everything wasn't all set? It's a figure of speech. Hold on. Safety pass. Open the hatch. Come on. Come on. Showtime. - You're free to go. - Thanks. Hey, there she is! Stop! Stop! - Hold your fire! - Take her alive! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! - You OK? - Yep. Used to play this game at Manticore - Escape and Evade. You were always good at it. - You OK? - Yeah. Fine. - You don't look so good. - I was up late. My family has a cabin about 30 miles north of here. You guys can stay there tonight. We can cross the border into Canada and never look back. We have it confirmed that the suspect is no longer in South Market. - What? - She got over the perimeter fence and jumped into some kind of vehicle. Find her! So. What makes you think this girl's the perp? The female's striking physical resemblance initially caught my attention. I didn't wanna believe it was her, but the more I thought, the more I realised it was possible. She has a real bad attitude and quite a temper, which she demonstrated this morning, as a matter of fact. I just felt it was my civic duty to step forward before she kills again. What if you're wrong? What if she didn't do it? Well, she walks. No harm, no foul. I'm getting the sense that you are not a man to be taken lightly. Am I right about that, Mr Ronald? Are you not a man to be taken lightly? Uh... yeah. I mean, no. Uh... Uh, yeah. I most certainly am. Not. That's what I thought. That's why I brought you in here. The fact is, Mr Ronald, if you know this girl, and if you can identify her, your life is in great, great danger. I'm serious. - What are we listening to? - Sibelius. It's sad. Yeah. It's anarchy out there, man. I call out runs, and they just ignore me. I mean, I never thought I'd say this, but, uh... Normal's got it tough back here. Maybe I ain't man enough to fill his shoes. Um... you can take comfort in the words of the great Bob Marley. "Me don't swim too tough, so me don't go out in water too deep." That just didn't help me out at all. Come, give I and I a package, man. - Thanks, man. - Peace. Here we are. Here you go. - Thanks for helpin' out. - I'd wish you good luck, but... He's a fun guy. You should see him get his drink on at the X5 reunions. - You're gonna be OK, you know. - Oh, yeah. I'll be better than OK. It's the way I'm made. It's you I'm worried about. I'll miss you. You could always ditch it all and go on the lam with me. Great way to visit exotic places, meet new people. - I'd just slow you down. - That's OK. I have to go back. Someone has to watch out for the downtrodden. Blah blah, woof woof, right? Right. - Take care of yourself. - You too. Just go. I'm makin' tea. What's your preference? Belladonna. Mandrake. Anything in the opium family. Might wanna think about gettin' some rest. Got a big day tomorrow. I can't sleep. Miss her, don't you? It's that obvious, huh? Get this surgery behind you, maybe you can go raft up with her. No, it was the right thing to do. Let her go. For a thousand different reasons. And I always do the right thing. Right? I thought you'd wanna get moving? Bang over the border into Canada before dawn? We've got a secure night's lodgings. Might as well take advantage. Here's to you finally doing the smart thing and getting out of Seattle. Right. I remember the morning of the escape, getting into Cheyenne around 7am. The streets were just starting to fill with people. Not soldiers or doctors, just regular people on their way to work. It scared the hell out of me. As far as I was concerned, they were all the enemy and I was completely outnumbered. I know the feeling. I climbed up onto the roof of an office building in downtown to lay low, just as the sun was coming up. It was my first morning as a free man. The whole world looked different. It was like it was in colour all of a sudden. I know I've been hard on you, Max. - But I'm just tryin' to keep you safe. - I know. You're gonna miss him, aren't you? You think that's stupid? No. Part of me wants the same things. Friends, a place where I belong. Someone to care about. I thought it was a sentimental lie. Even I have my moments of weakness. I appreciate your concern for my safety, but I've been locked in here for a long time and I gotta go to the bathroom very, very badly. Very badly. I've got good news. We've looked into the suspect. Our fears you were in danger are unfounded. Better safe than sorry. I'll be runnin' along. Not so fast. There's another matter we need to discuss, Mr Ronald. - Another matter? - Don't play games with me. You know what I'm talkin' about. Unpaid speeding tickets from two years ago. They've gone to warrant. There's gotta be some mistake, cos I don't own a car. Well, I don't know what to tell you, Mr Ronald, except that you are under arrest. Oy-oy! Listen. If you think you can squeeze my shoes like some dirtbag skell, you're a hump goin' sideways into a big-time jackpot. But it's your world, Detective. For the love of Mike. Terrific. Logan? Oh, my God. - What happened? - I found him unconscious. No head trauma. - He's tachy. What's his pressure? - BP's 80 and falling. He's gotta be bleeding. Get him to OR. Team one to ICU. ICU. Team one to ICU. ICU. - Hello? - Bling? Why have you got Logan's phone? - Hey, Max. - Is he all right? Can I talk to him? - He can't talk right now. - What's wrong? - Dr Clark needed in ICU. - Why are you at a hospital? - Turn. - Tell me! He's been havin' some problems lately. He collapsed this morning at home. - They're operating on him now. - What hospital? Metro Medical. Listen, Max... - Where are you goin'? - Max? - I'm going back. - No way. - I need to be there for him. - The mission is to get you over the border. - Yeah, well, I'm changing the mission. - Don't be crazy! Lydecker's got the entire city lookin' for you. Out of my way or I go through you. What's it gonna be? You gonna take me on? Huh, Maxie? Go ahead. Go ahead. You need to get your head in the game, soldier. Think I'm not in the game? Think again. OK. Do what you want. But don't think you're gonna make it back out of there! You're throwin' away your freedom. Consider it a moment of weakness. - I need suction. - Yes, Doctor. Whoa. We got a bleeder! Clamp. - Sponge. Hang another four units of AB neg. - We're already on our last two. Somebody get on the phone right now to the blood bank. We need more. Clamp. Oh, God... Blood pressure's still dropping. Give him ten of morphine. Keep him comfortable. - I'm sorry. You can't be in here. - Is he dying? - We can't discuss that right here. - Just tell me. Is he dying? He lost a lot of blood. He won't live without a transfusion. - So transfuse him. - It's not that simple. The blood banks are out. Logan is AB negative. It's the hardest type to find. I'm sorry, there is nothing we can do. Why don't you take a minute? I'll be right outside. Lucky for you I'm a universal donor. The people at Manticore figured it'd be handy if their killing machines could swap blood in a pinch. If you die on me, I'll kick your ass. - Dance with me. - I can't. Sure you can. Mind over matter. See, my problem is I can't walk. I'm not asking you to walk. Just dance. Whose dream is this, anyway? - Yours or mine? - Don't ask me. - You OK? - Yeah. - Just a little dizzy. - Wanna stop? No. Don't let go. - I won't. - Promise? I promise. Logan. Don't leave me. I'm gonna need you to stand up very slowly and put your hands in the air. What the hell's goin' on here? - My God. What are you doing? - Did it work? - BP is 110 over 90. - What? Did it work? Did it work? It's Captain Swanson on five. Says it's important. Lydecker. What sort of good news? I'll be right over. - Whaddaya got? - We got your killer. - Ah. Where is she? - He's in a holding cell. - There must be a mistake. - No mistake. He gave us details from the crime scene and he produced the murder weapon. - Where is he? - This way. Call off the 10-0-7 on the girl. OK, let's go. Everybody out. - What's goin' on? - The perp confessed. You can go. Let's go. Just go. There's a chopper at the airport to take him back to Manticore. Not what we hoped for, but not a bad day's catch, either. What about the girl? Swanson called off the search. We've worn out our welcome with the Seattle PD. Besides, she's long gone. Ah, he sacrificed himself for nothin'. I thought I'd taught him better. - Hey! - I have never been so glad to see someone. Yes, well, I have to say I'm glad to be here myself, actually. Let go of me. Let go of me now. Thank you. OK, I did the best I could. But these people are a bunch of slackers, bums and weirdos. - All right. Tell me about it. - I don't know how you put up with it, man. Right. Neither do I. Back in the pit with the rest of the cretins. 729 Campbell. Where the fire truck is Max? - Hey. - Figured you'd be napping all day. So I ate your lunch. Hospital food. One thing even the Pulse couldn't manage to make worse. How are you feelin'? Pretty good, considering. It must be all this supercharged Manticore blood I got in me. I still can't believe it. That he'd let himself be taken back there on my account. He cares about you. And I don't mean like a brother. I gotta get back to work. That's the music. From... the car? Right. From the car. You know, about what happened... After the car. I was real emotional, with all that was going on. I know. - It's not like... - Me neither. - I mean... - Exactly. - So long as that's clear. - I'm glad we talked about it. Me too. - See ya. - Later. Well, well, well. Look who decided to come in today. Don't bust my chops, Normal, or I might snap and kill again. We interrupt this programme to bring you news of a fatal air accident. The helicopter came from Seattle airport and was rumoured to be carrying a prisoner wanted on a federal warrant. The cause of the accident is being investigated. There is a report of gunfire at the scene of the crash, but police say no survivors were found... He always said he would rather die than go back to Manticore. Maybe I'm conning myself. Maybe I just know who Zack is and what he's capable of. But I can't help feeling that he survived somehow and that he's out there. So here I am, back in this broken city. And as long as I'm here, he will always know where to find me.
