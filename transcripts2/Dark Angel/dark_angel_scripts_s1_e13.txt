 - Whenever you're ready. - I don't recommend it. It's too soon to use psychoactives on him again. His system hasn't had time to recover. Your concerns are noted. Now let's proceed. Just give me a day or two to stabilise his condition. Maybe you don't understand what's at stake. He knows where the X5s are. He's got it locked in his brain, but I'm gonna get it out. - You're not gonna get anything if he's dead. - I'll take that risk. Do it. Do it, or I'll find someone else who will. Where are they, Zack?

 Where's Jondy? Where's Max? Tell me, and all this will be over. Zack. Max! How... how did you...? Sh. I'll explain later. We gotta get outta here. - Max, you shouldn't have come here. - After what you did for me, I had to. Can you make it over the perimeter fence? If I can't, you go on without me. The guards will be changing shifts soon. We'll make a break for it then. Did you tell them anything? About me or... the others? - If they've been compromised... - I didn't. - Tell me where they are so I can warn them. - I didn't say anything. You sure?

 - What's the matter, Zack? - I don't know. You tell me. - You're not Max. - Zack! - Who are you? - Zack! No... Leave him alone! Leave him alone! I'm tellin' you, he can't take this. I'll... never... tell... you... anything. - Hey. - Hey. - Check it out. - Haven't seen one of those in a while. Scored it at the market. Thought Logan might whip up one of his culinary miracles. He around? He went for a walk. - A walk? - Down by the waterfront. Hey. No trespassing. Can't you read? Take off your shoes and come here. I left you a little present back at your place. - A fresh chicken. - Oh, wow. I see a poulet chez Cale in your future, with a bottle of pre-Pulse Nuit-St-Georges. Say around... eight o'clock? I was hoping you'd say that. It's beautiful, isn't it? And it's funny. For the first time in a long time, I feel like anything and everything is possible. Aren't you cold? Freezing. But it feels great. This is a restricted area. This is a restricted area. I hate those things. Yeah. We'd better go. I guess so. See you tonight? - Eight o'clock. - Sharp. - I should get to work. - I gotta head home. - Bye. - Bye. Wrong way. How many times have I told you? You don't have a signature, you don't get paid. - 225 Carrington. - Signature. - Right there. - Robert Marley. That's more like it. - Doesn't seem fair. - It's not fair. But what could Original Cindy do? They turned off my electricity, heat, even my water. Uh, you're late. Back off, or I'll put a smackdown on your ass. Hey, cut her a little slack, man. She just got evicted from her apartment. I'm really sorry, girl. I can't help feelin' responsible. Not your fault you've got some hopped-up killin' machines gunnin' for you. I can't believe they killed your super. Me neither. Not that he didn't deserve it. I mean, he was a slum lord and a weasel. I can't blame the folks for wantin' me outta the building for bringin' in a bad element. First you lose yourjob because of me, and then your crib. Gig was a bust, crib was a dump. Original Cindy just gotta stay strong with the struggle. - Why don't you crash at my place? - Thanks, but I don't wanna impose. You're not. Kendra moved into her cop boyfriend's love nest, so there's plenty of room. - You sure? - We'll move you in at lunch. Just one question. Those superfreaks still lookin' for you? After the way I kicked their butt? What about those black helicopter boys? That whole situation's pretty much chilled out. - A'ight. I'm in. - Cool. At lunch. - Everything all right? - Yeah. - Why? - Tearin' through like you lost somethin'. - Just tryin' to find somethin' to wear. - Where you goin', anyway? - Over to Logan's. - Oh. So you got a date? It's not a date. She's just comin' over for dinner. Uh-huh. - We have dinner all the time. - Yeah, but things are different now. The... gun is loaded. If you know what I mean. No, I don't know what you mean. I've seen the way you two look at each other. With him up and around, - Maybe you two can do somethin' about it. - We're not like that. Besides... Just because I was in a wheelchair, doesn't mean I couldn't have gone there if I wanted. I understand. But it doesn't matter if the obstacle between you and him gettin' busy was physical or psychological, it's gone now. And your point is? That it's a whole new ball game. Which is why you're a nervous wreck. I'm not nervous. Ow! Yeah, right. This is just one more reason I'm glad I'm a lesbian. We don't put ourselves through all this drama. After the second date, we move in together. We're just friends gettin' together for dinner. Anything more than that is a sure-fire way... to ruin a nice friendship. Whatever you say. But I'm clearin' out of here just the same. If you're not comin' home, could you just call, so I don't worry? Are you all right? I'm sorry. It was the only way to get you out. Here. Put these on. - Why are you helping me? - So maybe I can live with myself. I'll get you to the state line. Then you're on your own. Just take it. Run! Run! Get out! Halt! Halt! Go! Go! All teams, he's on foot, headed southeast from rally point seven. - Hey. - Hey. Come on in. - Yeah? - Max? Who is this? So... So... Dinner. Oh, no! Chicken tartare? Oh, that's... That's so wrong. - Can... can you get that? - Yeah. - Turn the oven on. - OK. - Hello. - Max! Zack? I need you. He's hiding near Manticore. I have to get to him before they do. No. Those woods will be crawling with Lydecker's men. I'm going, Logan. I owe it to him. OK. Say you make it past the sector checkpoint. Say you even get to him. You think you can slip out through a Manticore dragnet? We did it once, and we were just kids then. What if it's a trap? What if Zack's been turned? Zack, turned? You don't know him at all, do you? - I am not letting you do this. - Nobody's gladder than me you're walking. But-reality check - I could still kick your ass. Contraband check. Shut her down. We gotta search the whole rig. Zack! Zack? - Zack! It's me. - What are you doin' here? - You're hurting me! - He sent you. - What are you talking about? You called me. - You're trying to trick me. I'm not trying to trick you. Lydecker's men are all over. We gotta get outta here. He sent you to bring me back, but it won't work. You were turned. You're a threat to the others. Zack! - Don't move. - I knew it. I knew you were one of them. If that were true, this'd be the part where I call in a TAC team and turn you over to Lydecker. But it's not true. I'm here because you asked me to come. Max. Shhh. It's OK. Everything's gonna be all right. We'll stay here till it gets dark, then I'm gonna get you outta here. What did they do to you? I didn't tell them anything, Max, about you or any of the others. If they used psychoactives on you, you can't be sure of anything. I couldn't have said anything, Max, because I don't know anything. I made myself forget, the way that they taught us to. No one can resist torture indefinitely. Not even you. The mind is infinitely pliable. You will tell what you know. - 54974235694... - Memories can be buried. Obfuscated. - 73711... - You can learn to forget what you know. - Your own name. Your bar code number. - 54974235694... By deliberately filling your mind with disinformation, you can so confuse your memory that you can't reveal the truth. Is this your bar code? Answer me! I made myself forget... to protect you. To protect all of you. - It's OK. It's over. - No. No, it's not. I'm the only one who knew. The only one. I've gotta remember so that I can protect them. You will. You called me, right? You remembered my number? - It's not the same. - Yes. You can do it if you try. No, it's different with you! I mean, how could I forget... a single thing about you? How could I? Better check it out, make sure we're OK in here. You stay put. It's me. It's been a long time since I've been able to let my guard down long enough to sleep. Probably wouldn't bother you. You never slept much anyway. Me and Jondy. We must have shark DNA in us or something. Just don't need to sleep. It's why she doesn't mind working nights. In a bar. In Portland. No, wait. That's Tinga. Jondy lives in San Francisco. - Go on. - She lives right near the Golden Gate. What about Tinga? You said she lives in Portland. Works at... a bakery. You should see how long her hair's gotten. - It's like she hasn't cut it since the escape. - Zane? Where does he live? In LA. He's a mechanic. He's got a dog. A German shepherd. Scary-looking. Like we had back in Manticore. But sweet. Keep going. You're doing great. The subscriber you're trying to page is out of service range. - Still can't get ahold of her, huh? - No. I'm heading to the market. You need anything? No thanks. Tell me about Krit. What's he up to? Krit? - I don't know. - It's OK. - I... I can't remember. - It's all right. It'll come back. I saw Brin back at Manticore. We're gonna get her out of there someday, you and me. You should get some rest. It won't be dark for a while yet. Thanks, Maxie. For comin' to get me, I mean. It's the least I can do after what you've done for me. Lydecker tried to trick me into thinkin' you came for me before. What do you mean? Trick you how? Shot me up with God knows what. Sent someone in pretending to be like you. Really messed with my head. - So tired. - It's OK. Sleep. I'm gonna head up the road. There's a gas station nearby. I'll get us some food. If I don't come back by sundown, keep going. Find the others. We're in position and standing by. Still no sign of her. - Has she shown yet? - Negative. What do you think he'll do when she doesn't show up? He'll do as he should do. Assume she's been captured, Move along and try to find the others. - What's wrong with the audio? - Shouldn't break up. I'm still gettin' a strong GPS signal. - He's movin'. - Any sign of her yet? - Negative. - This is takin' too long. Something's wrong. All units, this is Command. We're bringin' them in. He's movin'south, along the stream. He's stopped. Delta, this is Control. Target is south of your position, 175 degrees. Roger, Control. We're movin' in. Control, this is Delta team. We're in the target area. No sign of them. - Over. - That's impossible. He's right where you are. Sir? - The transmitter. - Say again. He's ripped it out of his head. Used it as a decoy. Max. They were listening to us the whole time... They heard about where the others are. - We've gotta warn them. - We've gotta get outta here first. It was a trick. Lydecker let him escape so he'd lead him to the others. I compromised the others. I jeopardised everything! What do you mean? How? By opening... my big mouth. It's a long story. Works at... a bakery. You should see how long her hair's gotten. It's like she hasn't cut it since the escape. He's gonna try to warn 'em. Let them know they've been compromised. We're gonna have to move on this, and we're gonna have to move fast. You said Tinga worked at a bakery in Portland. Which one? - I don't know. - What about Zane? Where did he work? - How did you stay in touch with them, Zack? - Contact number. I set up a voicemail box so they could check in with me. - And if you needed to reach one of them? - I'd call. Jondy. Did you call her? - What was her number? - I don't know. Think, Zack. Her life depends on it. Don't you think I know that by now?! - Give him time. - We don't have time. It could already be too late to save them. Sorry. It's not your fault. It's just... - There has to be a way to warn them. - Maybe there is. - What's up? - What happened to your knee? - I fell chasin' the guy. - Yeah, right, you sissy freak. Arrest him already. He's a reprobate. Don't you turn your back on a police officer, you weenie. - Do not attempt to adjust your sets. - Agh! This is a Streaming Freedom video bulletin. This cable hack is being beamed to you right across America. It cannot be traced. It cannot be stopped. This is a message for those known as X5. You have been compromised. You are in danger. Hand me that three-sixteenth. - Your locations have been compromised. - Zane? - You know what to do. - Zane? This message will repeat every hour on the hour until each of you has checked in. Now we wait to see who calls the contact number. - Eyes Only just made another enemy. - It was gettin' a little quiet around here. This Eyes Only is a pain in the ass do-gooder. But smart. But the question is, why is he trying to help my kids? I don't know. It's not the sort of thing he usually gets into. When all this is over, I want you to find out who this clown is. Zane, Syl and Krit have all called in. They're already on the move. Thatjust leaves Tinga and Jondy. You sure I didn't blab about the others? Believe me, I'd remember. How come you didn't give me this contact number so I could find you if I needed to? - You know why. - I wasn't a good soldier, following orders? Somethin' like that. Guess I won't be invited to the next X5 reunion. You're too reckless, Max. I couldn't risk givin' it to you. - What if you got caught and Lydecker got it? - I'm too much of a liability to be trusted? If you wanna get on board with the way I do things, it's not too late. First step, though, is leaving Seattle. I didn't think so. Especially not now. - What are you talking about? - I'm talkin' about Miracle Boy over there. We got a lead on the girl in Portland. Good. Have 'em send us a chopper ASAP. I'll take care of this one myself. A message from Tinga. Lydecker's on to her. She needs help. Come on, come on, come on! Move it! - What's the secret? - She was seen heading here. We've secured the area and I've got men along the perimeter. - She's here somewhere. - Do you know what she looks like? From when she applied for work at the bakery. All right. I want a point-to-point search, with Tasers only. I want her alive. Come on, Zack. Where are you? - We're lookin' for this girl. - Uh-uh. - Seen this girl? - No. I haven't seen her. - Do you recognise her? - No. All clear. There she is! She's movin' west! Delta team, converge on target. Alpha team, establish a perimeter. Alpha team copy. - Delta team to Command. - Go ahead. - We have the subject in sight. Will subdue. - All right. Just remember I want her alive. Is everybody in your family a thief? Hit it. - How much in the tank? - Three-quarters. Oughta be enough to get us to the Canadian border. Should I even ask? Let's go. - What about you? - She's goin' back to Seattle. - You're not coming with us? - Don't bother. - Lydecker... - I said don't bother. You take care of yourself, baby sister. You too. Thanks for gettin' me out. Guess this makes us even. I guess so. Let's hope miracles come in twos, because you're gonna need one to keep from gettin' caught. Still smokin'? - You lost him, Deck. - It was a calculated risk. The information we got on the other X5s more than made up for losing him. - If you say so. - They were underground. We got them out. Made 'em go on the run. No one on the run can avoid leaving a trail. Not even my kids. The committee has decided that the X5 situation needs to be resolved. You're hereby authorised to use whatever means necessary to see that it is. Am I to understand that you include using deadly force? - If that's what it takes. - We wanted them alive. The committee wants this situation resolved. You know I'm gonna have to go up the line on this? Don't bother. She signed the directive. She asked me to pass on a personal message. Do you have a problem executing the order? She'll find somebody else to do it. That won't be necessary. I didn't think it would be. She looks just like I remember. I wish I could have spent more time with her, though. Find out what her life's been like, what she's been up to. Maybe after everything settles down you two can hook up. - How? - Last number dialled. Zack's contact number. Oh! I can't believe it. He usually covers his tracks way better than this. - You'd think, huh? - Thanks. You got anything to eat? Why don't you go see for yourself? You got a half a poulet chez Cale, leafy green stuff, mashed potatoes. What do you say we have that dinner? Promise I won't bail on you this time. Uh... I have to take a rain check. I've got some work to do. Oh. OK. You can take it with you if you want. No, I'll get something on the way home. OK. Night. The number you have reached is not in service at this time and there is no new number. Please be sure you have checked the directory for the right number, and you are dialling correct... I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I mean, it's like I said. Zack usually covers his tracks pretty good. I just didn't think he'd cover them from me. Must be a guy thing, cos Logan can cover pretty good, too. Maybe it's me. Maybe there's something in the way I'm made that turns people away. All I know is, it was easier before, when I just didn't give a damn about anything. Yasmeen Khan ENGLISH SDH
