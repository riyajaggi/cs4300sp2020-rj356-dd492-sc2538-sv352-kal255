 Terminal City is a 20-block no-man's-land in the heart of Seattle. Closed ten years ago after a massive toxic spill, it is without power or water, and it is a felony to go beyond this security fence behind me. Terminal City is far from empty. It is home to rats, stray cats, a few homeless humans, and according to many reports an increasing number of transgenics, some of them far from human. Local citizens have begun setting up flaming X's, like this one, outside the fence, as a warning to the transgenics inside. - Go back where you came from! - Hey, freakazoids! Two million years of human evolution and this is what we get.

 You morons. - Did you get that? Tell me you got that! - Freak! - Hey, Mole. - Hey, Max. How'd it go? Ever notice how drug dealers have no sense of humour when it comes to money? That'll keep us in beer for a while. Good, cos we got a lot of new people around here. We've got X5s, X6s, even a few 7s. We got transhumans, Nomlies, pregnant females. It's turned into Grand Central Station around here. We're gonna need gas for the generator, iodine tablets ASAP, blankets, bedrolls, Sterno for stoves. We're gonna need food. We're gonna need weapons, bullets, ammo, guns, grenades, anything you can get. - I'm gonna need more cigars. - There are only so many hours in the night. - Evenin'. - Hey, Max.

 Some people are calling you vigilantes. Nah, we're just concerned citizens. Kinda like a neighbourhood watch troop. We want our streets safe from these mutant freaks. Should we wait until they break into our houses and take our daughters? Believe this pudknocker? They need to go back wherever the hell they came from. - Get outta town, egg-sucking freaks! - You're right on, Charlie. You heard 'em. Looks like it's back to Manticore. Things are tense at the gates of Terminal City. - Hey, Joshua. - Hey. - What ya doin'? - It's a flag. It's our flag. We'll need it when our transhuman drill team is marching in the St Paddy's Day parade. - Don't forget half-time at Seahawks games. - Hey, cut it out. An unknown woman on a motorcycle went over the fence... This is you, me, even them. It's all of us. This is where we came from, where they tried to keep us. - In the dark. - Secret. This is where we are now because our blood is being spilled. And this is where we want to go. - Into the light. - Light. You understand bringing in this team compromises my cover at the agency? Your position has served us well. The Conclave feels that... With all due respect to the Conclave, bringing in outside muscle is not the solution to this problem. Hardly "outside muscle". The Phalanx are the best we have. The elite of our warrior breeding line. The tip of the spear. They come by direct order of the Conclave, so discussion is pointless. I bow to the wisdom. Fe'nos tol. I'm Thula, team leader. Fe'nos tol. I've heard a lot about you. I'm surprised you couldn't handle one girl on your own. Your target's a little more than a "girl". You defend your failure by flattering your enemy? 452 is a threat to everything we've worked for throughout the generations. Her death is our highest priority. Don't worry, Brother. We'll clean your mess up for you. They designed her to be the perfect soldier, a human weapon. Then she escaped. In a future not far from now, in a broken world, she is haunted by her past. She cannot run. She must fight to discover her destiny. - You seen my girl? - No. - Do I need a touch-up? - No, you're good. Hey, guys... Check this out. It's a hat. With a fully rotational brim, so you can always represent. Yeah. Represent your massive stupidity. That's one opinion. All right, babe. Sky. - Normal, what's the good word, buddy? - # sings "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow" - The man's finally lost it. - Many happy returns there, buddy boy. - It's not my birthday. - It's right there on your application form. Oh, yeah, yeah. Boy, nothing gets by you, does it, Normal? I made that without eggs and butter. I know you look out for the physique. Go ahead, blow it out. If you see your colleague Max, tell her she's fired. She gonna be here, like, any minute. Do you think I buy your lies for, like, a nanosecond? Man is like a steel trap. Keep covering up for her, you'll be outta here. Ya promise? Basic CDC procedure. Yeah, to protect you against your biohazard girlfriend. - I didn't mean that last part. - It's OK. - This is awkward. - For me, too. But I figured you should check these out before they faded. - When did they appear? - Last night. So, any luck on translating the stuff? Hold still. I'm making progress, but... some of it's still missing. Maybe not. Sorry. - Hm. - Hm what? Just hm. If Sandeman put these in your genome from day one, like your bar code, - then it's part of a plan. - Instead of making my skin a Jumbotron, why didn't he give me something I could use, like x-ray vision or something? Maybe he did. Maybe it just hasn't shown up yet. I gotta jet. Yeah. Could you zip me? I'm way beyond late, and I still gotta go home and change, so... Thanks for this. Yeah. I'll give you a call if I turn up anything on these. OK. Yeah. You sure this is the right way? I think so. It said south on 7th. I figure we got another half a click or so. Can you make it? I'll make it. Hey, hey, come back. Hurry. Hurry, come. In. In. In. Go, go! - Hey, I'm Gem, X5. This is Dalton. - X6. Joshua. - You're having a... baby? - Yeah. When's the baby due? Last week. Keeping my legs crossed until we reach the promised land. Terminal City ain't exactly the promised land, but we got guys with medical training. Watch out! - Is everyone fine? - Yeah, I think so. You all right? - Yeah. - Bastard backs out without even lookin'. We need to go. - We need to go. - Yeah, yeah. Hang on. It's not starting? This is not good. We got company. We gotta blaze. We gotta blaze now! Man up, dog. You're the one who wanted some action. - Uh-oh. - Hey! Punk-ass! Look what you did to my truck! - Punk-ass? - Uh-oh. You mean Mr Punk-ass, don't ya? - Damn. It's one of those freaks. - Now, that hurts. I'll say one thing for ordinaries. They know when to run. - Maybe we should run, too. - We don't run, we fall back. Let's go. - Go for Max. - Little fella, everything's gone sideways. It's FUBAR, people screaming... Gem is trying to keep her legs crossed so the baby won't pop out. - What? Where are you? - I'm at South Market. You're right around the corner from Jam Pony. Find Alec, he'll get you a car. OK? - Joshua. - Max? Max? Battery died. She said Jam Pony, then battery died. - Which way? Come on. - Come. Go, go, go! Out of the way. Out of the way! - Freaks! - Look at that! Suspects in sight. This way. I'm in pursuit! - Alec, I'm so glad to see you. - Uh-huh. This is Gem. She's having a baby. Oh, so you stop by Jam Pony in broad daylight. Max said to come see you and get a car and then... Don't turn around. Keep walking. You in the hood... drop your weapon! Drop the weapon now, put your hands on your head! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whoa! Get back or he's dead! I said stay back or he's dead! - Play along. - Yeah, no problem. Oh, this should be interesting. - Jumpin' George W. - Don't blow my cover. This cannot be good. - Got a back door? - Yeah. All right, nobody move. They've got my boy! No, no. Go back! Freeze! I said freeze! Get back! Hold it right there, freak show! You're bleeding. Bullets'll do that to you. OK, you're safe now. No. I'm safe now. No one leaves! Nobody move! CeCe's one of 'em, too. Cool. CeCe, call base. Tell 'em we're in trouble. Joshua, take the front. Mole, you got back? - Got it. - Your name? - Dalton. - Why don't you keep an eye on the street? - My golden boy's a mutant. - We prefer "genetically empowered". - Take me, Jesus. - Careful what you wish for. You in the building, this is the Seattle Police Department. The building is completely surrounded. Throw your weapons out and come out with your hands visible, and you will be treated fairly under the law. Throw your weapons out and come out with your hands on top of your heads. Hey. Who ordered a pizza? - My watch. - It's all yours. - What's that? - It's a hole in my body made by a bullet. Been there, done that. Check the news. - Hey, how's Gem? - This girl is havin' a baby. I can still move, if you need to displace. It's turning into a damn pig farm out there. Who said you could get up? Uh... Bathroom. Hey! No more pictures. Go. Uh... Go. - Who put you in charge? - These people are not the enemy. Don't be so sure. I always knew you were a wrong number. You never had me fooled for a second, miss. Yeah. Transgenic Central right here under your nose. Shut up. Listen up. I know things are really tense right now... Gee, I wonder why. If you'll sit tight and be patient, we'll get out of here before you know it. I got a hot flash. Me and mine are gonna get out now. Let's go, people. Bip bip bip. Go on, take your best shot, frog boy. Nobody's shootin' at anybody. Now, sit your raggedy ass down. Not only are you a daughter of Sappho, you're one of them, too? No. What I am is a friend to Max and Alec and CeCe and the rest of 'em. We walk outta here now, they're toast. - I don't have a problem with that. - Well, I do. And I'm guessin' so does anyone else here who is down with my girl. So how about we take a minute, figure this bitch out, so that nobody else gets hurt? Aiight? Armed transgenics and transhumans have barricaded themselves in this building, the offices of the Jam Pony messenger service. Already angry crowds have gathered, shouting anti-transgenic slogans. Just moments ago, an unknown woman commandeered a Hoverdrone. She rode it over the police cordon and into the building in which the suspects are barricaded. Police believe the woman is a transgenic, apparently coming to the aid of the suspects inside. Yeah. - Good news. We've found our target. - Excellent. The bad news is she's sitting smack in the middle of Seattle PD, sector cops, my agency people, and every news crew in the city. - This complicates things. - I think we can hit her under their noses. I need a little bit of time to heat things up. Be ready. Always. - Get the mutant freaks out of our city! - Stay behind the barricade! Where's my phone? A secure line should have been here. Get that news team behind that barricade. Next camera I see, the guy goes for a ride. Special Agent in Charge Ames White. Nice badge. Picture looks just like you. Appreciate you securing the area. We'll take it from here. I'm so pleased. Now I won't have to miss my son's recital this afternoon. Get this idiot outta here. You're out of your league. Ask your men to stand down. Not until those hostages are out in one piece. Where's my freakin' phone? You're not dealing with punks who boost TVs for a living. They're trained, genetically engineered killing machines. As far as I know, no one's dead yet. I intend to keep it that way. I need you and I need your lady friend behind that barricade, so I can do my job. - You force me to go over your head? - Do what you gotta do, Special Agent. Just do it someplace else. - Where the hell is my phone? - Kill the freaks! The economy is bad enough. You want 'em taking your job? You want 'em living next door spitting out their mutant half-breed kids? These mutant freaks are an affront to nature. Who's taking care of this? Nobody! These freaks are running rampant. They get to do whatever they want. These things aren't natural. They don't deserve to live. They should be lined up and shot like the rabid dogs they are. These freakoids smashed up my truck. That's taking bread out of my mouth... Really FUBAR, little fella. We just gotta hang tough. It's gonna be OK. I don't know. The way upstairs people look at me... I don't know if it'll ever be OK. I say, kill the freaks or send them back to whatever cesspool they came from! Yeah! If it's a package, get a number. ...to deal with this transgenic threat. Start talking. Detective Ramon Clemente of the Seattle PD. Who is this? Let's keep it simple and you call me 452. OK, 452. I want a van with a full tank of gas. Before you give me your Christmas list, why don't you let those people come out? Not until I get my transportation and a guarantee of safe passage out. You have a wounded man and a pregnant woman - who, I'm sure, need medical attention. - Just the van. We'll take care of our own. If I agree to your terms, when do I get my hostages? Half when the van arrives. Half when we get to our destination. - Which would be where? - It's not far. They'll be home for dinner. You're dreamin' if you think they'll let us drive off into the sunset. Get it through your head. The only way they want this to end is with us dead. There's no point in discussing human rights since they're not human, so they don't have rights. They don't even have souls. It's worse than that, because animals don't have souls, but they were meant to be here. These things were never even intended by God to exist. They are an insult to everything in his creation. I was hoping you might be interested in having me interview you about your life as a hot transgenic female on the run in post-Pulse America. No! - But it is known that they are armed... - Sorry, dude. Whatever. Please tell me that he is not the baby daddy. He was another X5. We were breeding partners. - That sounds real romantic. - It wasn't. ...taking innocent people hostage. - What you got? - A headache and I got your vehicle. Now send out the hostages. It's on. Get our people in position. Stand clear. Behind the barricade, people! - How's it look? - I don't know, it's dicey. Got shooters on the roof, bus door's on the exposed side. Yeah, it looks pretty messy. All right. You're gonna have to use the messengers as shields. OK. Clemente, I'm gonna need the snipers on the roof pulled back, or no deal! Sniper team, pull back. Pull back. All right, you're clear. Wish me luck. First group's comin' out! OK, guys, come on. Keep your arms in the air and go slow. All right? Be careful. This way. Keep your hands in the air. Come towards the barricade. OK, 452. The keys are in the vehicle. Your ball. They won't shoot. We got a kid and a pregnant girl. They don't know which ones are transgenic. A couple of us, they got a pretty good idea. - Come on. - They saw you flying over their heads. I got you. - Thanks. - They don't know about me. - Then help me protect my girl. - All right, let's file in, guys. Come on. This is my cover story, man. Let's do this. Wait for my command. Take the shot. Max! Go! Get back! Cease fire! - Cease fire! - Move, move, move, move! Fall back! Cover the door! Anyone else hit? - No. - No. All right, get down. I want everybody on the floor. Now! Stay there! Stay down! They killed her. Go take care of Gem. Why did they do this? We did everything they wanted. This is on you. I told you not to trust the cops. It wasn't the cops. It was White. - White is out there? - Yeah. White's guys did this. They killed CeCe. They screwed this up on purpose to escalate the situation. Yeah, well, it worked. What difference does it make who fired? They all want to see us dead! Calm down. - I won't wait around for them to try again. - What are you doing? Until we get safe passage, we kill one hostage every hour. - Let him go! - I don't take orders from your kind. - You take orders from me. Let him go. - No. We gotta show them we mean business, or we're dead! That's a good idea. Shooting people. That's what White wants. - Prove you're the monster that people think. - Shut up! You're not one of us! No, I'm not. But I'm standing right here with you, aren't I? All right, people, listen up! If we don't stick together, we don't get out of here alive. You understand that? OK. OK. But if they come near the building, I start taking them out. Come on, Joshua. Joshua... Joshua! Thanks, guys. That was close. - Kill the freaks! They all should die! - Yeah! You fed son of a bitch. You get off my scene right now, or I swear I will kick you to the curb myself. Seems your snipers got carried away. - Those were your men and we both know it! - Is that what we know? I don't know that, but what I do know is that this was faxed in from the governor's office. So you got friends in high places? I draw your attention to the part where I'm given overriding jurisdiction. - You screwed up, Lieutenant. - Yeah, when I voted for this nimrod. My tactical team is gonna go in. We'll get this done. And you are gonna stay out of my way. But thanks for coming out. It wasn't your fault. This is all my fault. I let these people loose in the world, but there's no place for us out here. There's no place anywhere. You gave them freedom, Max. And the thing about freedom... It's never free. Push. Push. That's it, girl. Keep pushing. The situation is extremely tense... Yes. Push. Push. You can do it. No. Wrong. Ca-ca. Don't you know anything about birthin' babies? Pushing is exactly what she should not be doing now. Listen, I want you to breathe and relax, OK? All right, just breathe and relax. Breathe and relax. That's it. OK. OK. OK, you're fully dilated. You're in late second stage. It's not gonna be long now. I want you to breathe from your diaphragm, OK? - And you know this how? - My dad was a dairy farmer. I know my way around the inside of a heifer better than you do. OK. - I need a weapon! - You're out of this fight, soldier. Me and my baby are getting out alive. You get that baby into this world. We got your back. OK? I say we kill 'em like cockroaches. Burn 'em out, before they spread, before they breed. Clemente, this is White. I'm inserting my team now. Remember, zero interference. It's your world. - What is this? Who are these people? - They're on loan from another agency. - What agency? I don't understand, sir. - Let's keep it that way. You're not cleared for this op. Now, move the men back and secure the perimeter. Walk away. Do it now. Look at them. When we carry her out in a body bag, they'll be clappin', cheerin'. They'll never know she was their only hope. - It's me White wants. I'm going out there. - No way. He wants this thing to end badly. I won't let that happen. - Max, you're not goin' out there. - I have to. - OK, take a breath. - Max, listen to me. After you left, I translated the new runes on your skin. - Is that the message from Father? - That's right. I think it's complete. The symbols have multiple meanings, but the gist is: "When the shroud of death covers the face of the earth, the one whose power is hidden will deliver the helpless." What does that mean? It means something really, really bad, like maybe biblically bad, is gonna happen. And you're the one who's gonna stop it. Look, if all of this is about White getting Max, specifically Max, then she should go out there. - Forget it. - She runs for it. - Lets him see her. She's fast. - No. - He'll leave us alone because she's gone. - No. No. Out of the question, Mole! Wake up, chimp! We're out of options here. No, you wake up. If she is the key to saving millions of people from some kind of apocalypse... Your people or my people? People! Human beings, like you and me. They're coming. They're coming. Carry Gem. Come on, let's go. - I don't hear anything. - Joshua, you carry Gem. - We're clear. - Don't argue. Dalton, let's go. Come on. I need everybody upstairs right now. Let's go. Follow me. Hang on. Come on. - Remember, our primary target is 452. - What about the hostages? Let's show the viewers at home what the mutant menace does to innocent people. Take out the hostages, the freaks, the kid. Take out anything with a pulse. Come on, guys. File in. Stay low. All the way to the back. Hey, Sketchy, keep them quiet and keep them down. - Stay down. - Take cover behind the desk. Come on. Hurry up. Keep her behind the desk. - Mole! - Go, go, go. Move it. Take cover. Wait for my signal. We hit hard, we hit fast, and we don't back off. This is for all the marbles, people. Shh. Shh. Quiet, quiet. - 452... - Just bring it. OK. OK, listen. OK, it's time to push now. Come on. Push, push, push with all your might, all your might. All right, it's coming. It's coming. The baby's coming. I can see the head. You gotta bear down. Really bear down. Time to push now. Bear down hard now, honey. Bear down hard. That's it. Good! Go! Push, push, push, push, push, push, push, push! - You all right? - Yeah. One more big push. Really crank down! Really crank down! Stay down! - Max, clear! - Clear! Joshua, no! Joshua, no! - Joshua, no! - He deserves to die! - He killed Annie. - No, he deserves to die a lot! If you kill him now, the only thing people will remember is how some transgenic killed a human being in cold blood. And then they'll never stop hunting us. Bring around your muscle queens any time. I'll be happy to kick their ass. - We are not finished. - Fe'nos tol, bitch! Oh, there you go. Oh, what a dear little sweet soul. - No bar code. She doesn't have one. - Then she's free. Not yet, she ain't. Weapons down, hold your fire, team coming out! Let's go! Federal agents - step back! I need you back! Move, move! We may have a biohazard here, people. Make a hole. Make a hole! Move, move! Let's go! Agent White wants your people in there to secure the crime scene ASAP. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! We're gonna need to commandeer this ambulance. Agent White is not a man who likes to be kept waiting, Detective. We'll take over from here, unless you wanna be stuck with a six-hour decontamination hose-down. Clear the barricades! Clear the barricades! Clear the barricades! Clear 'em! Let's go! Nice and easy. Let's move it. Move! Move! Let's go, let's move it! Move, move, move, move! Out of the way! - Where are we goin'? - Just drive! - Can I turn on the siren? - Just drive, fool! All right, let's get in there. We're clear. - Yeah, baby. That's what I'm talking about. - It's all good. - Yeah. - All right! We rock! - That chick was kicking your ass. - I had it, I was just setting her up. All right. Head for Terminal City. - Anyone hurt? - No, we're OK. But you better go look upstairs. Special Agent in Charge White. What? The transgenics taped you up and took your uniforms? No way. ...son of a bitch. And you want me to go after them? That's a good idea. ...son of a bitch. We got company. Stop your vehicles now, or you will be fired upon. Pull over now, or we will use deadly force to stop you! Don't stop. Keep moving. - What should I do? - Keep driving. - Follow Max. She knows what she's doing. - OK. - Go straight through the gates. - Hold on. You're gonna make a right, a left, then straight up the ramp. Straight through the building. End of the line. Throw your weapons out and let me see your hands! - So what's your plan now? - Max? Throw your weapons out now! You heard the man. - Well, this sucks. - I fought the law, and the law won. Throw your weapons out and put your hands where I can see them! Throw 'em out! Do it! Step away from the vehicle and keep those hands up! Do it! Put your hands up! Keep 'em up! Keep those hands up! Step out of the vehicle and keep those hands up! Get down on your knees and put your hands on your head! Get down on your knees now! Do it! - 452? - You can call me Max. - I think you better get down on the ground. - Actually, I think you should probably go. - I'm not gonna tell you again. - I'm not gonna tell you again. On your left. You can try to arrest us all, but you guys might wanna call it a night and go have a beer. All right. All right, everybody, let's back it up. Let's back it up! Outside the fence! Back it up! Come on, let's move! You kept today from being a bloodbath. I respect that. - You held up your end, too. - But you haven't won anything. This is gonna get ugly and it's way over my head now. These people's lives depend on the decisions that you make right now. I pray you make the right ones... Max. Escape and evade. We divide up into teams, pick an azimuth, and go to ground. No, we stay here! In a couple of hours, that perimeter will be locked down. Tanks, National Guard, every cop within 100 miles. We'll be digging our own grave. Mole's right. We move now, they'll never be able to catch us all. Where are we gonna go? I can't stop anyone, but I'm through running and hiding and being afraid. I'm not gonna live my life like that any more. Aren't you tired of living in darkness? Don't you wanna feel the sun on your face? To have a place of your own, where you can walk down the street without being afraid? They made us, and they trained us to be soldiers, to defend this country. It's time for them to face us and take responsibility, instead of trying to sweep us away like garbage. We were made in America and we're not going anywhere. So they call us freaks. Who cares? Today I'm proud to be a freak. And today we're gonna make a stand right here. Who's with me? What the hell. Right on. What are these creatures like? Is it true you delivered a transgenic baby? Yes, I did indeed, and a beautiful bouncing baby girl she is. You're saying they're not all monsters? Monsters? No. No more than you and me. Hey! Let's go there, Sparky. Not a country club. Bip bip bip. Move! As dawn breaks on this, the third day of the siege at Terminal City, the situation is tense but unchanged. While hundreds of transgenics remain barricaded inside the restricted area, police and National Guard stand an uneasy watch at the perimeter, each side seemingly waiting to see what the other will do next. Now look what you've done.
