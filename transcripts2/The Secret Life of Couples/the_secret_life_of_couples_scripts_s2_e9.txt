 It's ridiculous that the authorities allow these fake therapists to practice. The woman's a bitch! It's clearly group sex. You need to check out that Tantra Institute thing. Who put you up to it? Your accusations are as twisted as what's being said about Tantra. You two can only talk with my approval and in my presence. Whatever troubles me and hurts me, I fix another way. Christian! Get off of me! Get out! Go somewhere else!

 You can't go out like that every night. Be more discreet. If I have Cristal or moonshine, they talk about me anyway. Mom. We're home! I'd love Pedro to move back in with me. We could all live together. - Is it that awful to see me? - What is it you want? I just want to see you. Call this number to be one of them. - You're in if he likes you. - I've been around. A huge toast to Serapião! Good evening. I don't have much experience. I can be your teacher, and if you're a good student, you can win a special prize. Now I hope we can lock up that dirty old man.

 - What do you know about Praxis? - Nothing. Supreme Court President Serapião Mendonça was found dead today. Praxis takes full responsibility for the trial and death of corrupt judge Serapião Mendonça. Today, Praxis has launched the era of true justice. What does it have to do with me? Was I a part of it? I always said you'd only know what you needed to know. We never mentioned killing. Did you guys do it? Is that the movement you keep talking about? The first thing we learn here is that nobody knows everything, only our part in the mission. You agree with that? I think we're important in this game, but Praxis is much bigger than we are. I just went to get a file! But killing somebody? It has nothing to do with you. It sure doesn't, because I'm quitting this movement. I will not be an accessory to any crime. The very first time we spoke I said we were at war. All wars have casualties. That's why your sister died. The difference is that Praxis doesn't kill innocent people. That guy, that guy's responsible for this whole war. He can't do that, Sofia. By decreeing the death penalty, Hermes is as much of a criminal as they are. I know that. It's crazy, but this guy is totally off the grid. It's an entirely underground movement. I haven't told anyone about Daniel's video, but you and I know about it. Hermes is involved with Praxis, we need to report that immediately. Report what? An avatar who we don't know? No, a criminal who will be caught. I don't know how to get to him. I haven't a clue. I can't even contact him. He'll contact you because he wants the password. Intelligence will find him through you. Luis, my life is already a living hell with what's going on, the Tantra scandal, my implication with Daniel's and Otero's deaths. Have you thought about, or figured out the consequences of linking me to Hermes, or Praxis, or to this crime? This madman must be stopped. No one can stop him, no one. He'll do whatever he wants in spite of us. We can't stop this movement. We need to stay out of it, Luis. But we're already in it. I want out. I'll have nothing to do with it. I want to forget all about it. Sofia, I haven't said anything to protect you, but now I'm lying at work. What do you mean? It's my duty to report everything I know, and I haven't. Your duty? To report it to whom? What I'm about to tell you stays between us. I work for ABIN, a government intelligence agency. That crime, the death of a judge, the Supreme Court President, is a national security issue. So as of today, everything I decide not to report will make me a criminal too. What kind of organization is Praxis? It makes no sense that none of us ever heard of it. A movement like this can't come out of nowhere. It's a plan. All my guys are working on it, but Zairo needs to alert ABIN and the feds. This is an emergency. That letter to the public has inside information. Some insiders are in this. This is a left-wing thing. It's the communists. They're terrorists. They should be shot. It's the only way they learn. Only the military can deal with those bastards. Has anyone called Zairo? He won't pick up. He's locked in with the military. What do the feds say? Who is this nutcase? No, no feds this time. They're dangerous too. They're out to get us. This whole thing sucks! The opposition's choking us, the cops are out to get us, and now these extremists, what's the name again? Praxis. It means action in Greek. Practical activity as opposed to a theory, an idea. The Marxist philosophy of the transformation of reality. I told you it's communism! This is all coming from a place we've neglected, guys. Navarro, we need to find out who's behind all this to get rid of this movement. I agree with you, Edgar. But Zairo needs to respond with brute force. A weak administration will bury all of us. I address the Brazilian people following these alarming news in these tumultuous times. Charges will be filed against our detractors for this shameless fabrication of fake news in an effort to destroy our democracy. An investigation has been launched regarding the death of the Supreme Court President and we are reviewing in the most thorough way possible all of these accusations of corruption. Congress... The guy's exonerating himself. What a dirty trick. That's politics. I'm fed up. Wherever I look there's crime. Impunity. Obstruction. It's such a waste of time. I feel so powerless. I'm here for you, okay? You, me, and a few others. What can we do? Nothing. It's just a few of us against so many of them. No, of course not. There are so many of us against a few of them. There are 200 million of us against just a few crooks. You're not alone. You're not alone. I'm here with you. Okay? Roberta, stop it, stop it! Please stop. Hold on. Stop it. Giordana: I'm on my way up. Sorry. I didn't know she... I didn't know. I'm sorry. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine and you? Good. I thought you were alone. - She... - I was just leaving. We were just reviewing the recent nasty local events. I guess you're very familiar with all that, right? Familiar in what way? People in power get used to some very disgusting things. But that's our reality, so... I don't even know you, but I'm sure your reality and mine are very different. Definitely. Thank God. Bye, Roberta. Zairo. - I wasn't expecting you. - You're going out again? Is there any supper at least? No, you didn't tell me. Sure I did. I sent you a message. I'm sorry, honey. I must've been in the bathroom and missed it. But don't worry. Celeste will fix you something. Where are you going? To one of those benefit dinners you love me to go to. Whose? The ladies that raise funds for homeless kids. I'm making a donation and I need to be on my way, you know nothing gets started without me. I'm the First Lady. The star, right? All by yourself? I let Antonio off because it's late. I'll be right back, okay, honey? Don't worry. I'll have her make your supper. There's too much pressure. We can't wait any longer, Janeluce. What a mess, Jander! I'm no fireman to put out all these fires. You'd rather burn at the stake? It's just for a few days, honey. You'll go sightseeing. Sightseeing in Liechten...? Liechten... That shitty town whose name I can't even pronounce. Why not the Caribbean? The Cayman Islands, or the Virgin Islands. I already said no. Those places are all monitored. I transferred everything to Liechtenstein. It's not on anybody's radar. They're expecting you, they'll welcome you over there. Put everything in a safety deposit box and stay a few days, take some trips, go sightseeing. Take some trips? Go Sightseeing? In that boring place! I like Miami, honey. Miami... Some other time. This is an emergency. But it's so risky! Have you thought about the risk I'm taking? I could get caught with all this cash. What am I going to say? I'll be imprisoned, honey. No way, honey. There are protocols to follow. It's a private jet, you're rich, all the jewelry's yours. You're so beautiful! They'll respect the wife of a member of Parliament, baby. What a mess! We're here in front of the Senate waiting for Tarso Galhardo. Damn it! Please comment on the soya deal, Mr. President. Mr. President, a comment, please. What is the real deal here? Any comments, sir? Mr. President, please. Mr. President, are you involved? That's enough. Stop it. Stop it. The soya deal... Damn it! You nearly let me fall! Do your job! You need to protect me from that hoard of morons. You work for me! No. I'm the people. It's you who work for me. Thank you. "You said you don't want to talk. And I accept that. So here's some advice. A bed can be the perfect place not to talk." I told myself, if you got upset and tore it up, I'd leave. But I'd stay if you smiled. I did not smile. Discreetly, with your eyes. No, I just looked down and from where you are... I was watching you, I felt the vibes. Marco. You look so serious. You're not like that. You're much more fun. How do you know what I'm like? I read you. I'm literally reading you. It's very good. You should practice what you preach. I think you're going too far. We need to live this now. We feel this intense desire, this chemistry. It's what I want. Don't you? - It's complicated. - Everything is complicated. But I'm in a situation that's... I'm in a complicated situation. That's fine with me. Marco, I'm not a free person. I'm not a common person. And it isn't fair to get you involved in it. We carry this burden. This snail's shell on our backs. Let me carry it for you. Okay, okay. I know you don't need anyone. You need no one, much less me. But did you know on our skin we have marks we can read? If you look at every line, every pore. Here, for example. This line is me entering your life. And you might want to fight against it, you might want to deny it, but you can't run from the fate that's written on the palm of your hand. So, I got married and it was over in less than two years. We were very immature. It was a casual relationship, we were always so carefree. We went out and had fun. It was never too serious. That was when she got pregnant, she wanted to get married, so we did that. Then we had Ian, who lives with his mom out of town. He has his grandparents and he's very happy. I go to see him every two weeks and that's how it goes. Marco, you can't stay. Is it something I said, Sofia? Is it something I said? You can't stay here, go away. - Is it something I said? - No, just leave, please. Fine. SEX SCAM: SEXOLOGIST BLACKMAILS PATIENTS. TWO DEAD. That's her car. It's her. Sofia, give us a statement. Sofia! Sofia! Are you involved in Otero's death? She is not giving any interviews. She has nothing to say right now. Please show some respect. Is it true you guys have group sex? It's a den of orgies. You guys want a scandal? I'll give you a scandal! You guys know nothing! You don't know how important this job is. You're ruining the lives of the people seeking treatment! - Enough, Sofia! - You're just haters and bigots! You despise freedom! That's enough, Sofia! One more question. Just one more. Are you insane? Have you lost your mind? Are we going to keep quiet? Can we possibly keep quiet? You can't behave like that, like some maniac in public. They scare us into doing whatever they want. Calm down already. That's what I'm here for. Don't you see, Sofia? You just triggered thousands of stories and articles that will go viral and get taken out of context. Do you want us to lose everything? Destroy everything we achieved, tell them they're right, that you're totally incapable of controlling yourself at a time like this? You lost it, Sofia. You're giving them exactly what they want. Can't you see you're proving how incapable you are of being a therapist or helping anyone, let alone have any judgment? Plus acting like a madwoman! It's wasn't that bad! It's normal to react like that against a bunch of buzzards. But that was terrible for Tantra, for me, it was something... I can't allow myself to be so careless. You did what anybody else would do, Sofia. No, it's not just about me. There's so much at stake here. There's a whole process, so many people involved. Sofia! Sofia! Sofia! Stop it. Stop it. That's it. Breathe. Just stop. Just stop. You shut the door, and left it outside. I won't let you do this. I won't...! I won't let you do this. It's just you and me here, okay? Calm down. Hug me. Come here. That's it. I'm here with you. Take it easy. We can change all of this. Good morning. You must be Pedro. I'm Marco. Nice to meet you. Hi. I'm preparing breakfast. How about some juice? Where's my mom? She'll be down any minute. Is that guy living here? No, of course not. - Is he your boyfriend? - Not exactly. So it's just sex then? - Pedro, it's my life. - No, Mom, it's not your life, because your life affects mine, just like my life affects yours. Lower your voice. Damn it, Mom! With what's going on at Tantra, you won't let Dad move back because of that guy? No, that's not it, Pedro. Plus, he's so young! It's unacceptable! Pedro, Pedro, come back. Let's talk about it. I should never have come back, or moved back in with you. Giordana, with all that's going on, you should stop coming here. You won't treat me anymore? It's my dad, right? Did he pay you to get rid of me? He corrupted you too? No, Giordana, no. I don't want to get you involved in this scandal. They haven't identified you, but you come from a well-known family. If they find out, if your name gets involved, they will burn you at the stake. I've been through worse things. Giordana, I will not expose you like this. If I go down, it's unfair to drag you down with me. You won't see me anymore because of this infamous thing. You won't treat me anymore? Is that it? Giordana. I think we've come to a point where I can't help you anymore. You've locked up something deep inside you which I'm not sure I can unlock. No, you're mistaken, Sofia. You reached a place inside me where nobody, not even I, had the courage to go. I'm making a radical move here. I think you should do the same. I'm not treating you anymore, Giordana. Listen up, guys. This is Giba. - Hi. - We started together. I joined the movement and then I moved on. Giba's great at detecting flaws in any system. My specialty. Nice to meet you. Now we're helping him leave the country. Sit down, Giba. Giba used to work for a security company. You tell them, Giba. We protected Totterman's computer room. Then one day we realized someone was hacking the files. So I notified Major. Major? He's a sort of gofer working for Navarro. A real jack-of-all-trades. Giba realized someone had hacked Totterman's system, they tracked the location, and it was your sister's IP. She broke in openly with no kind of protection. We detected it quickly. Navarro sent Major and a gorilla to find out who it was. I didn't know who she was, let alone the consequences this would bring. I'm so sorry. Giba, right? I know you did your job, and you didn't know what they could do. But you're not leaving the country without making a statement. We need to catch them. He needs to disappear. He has to go. What? He needs to go. After I found out what happened, I couldn't stay, so I left. I know too much. They must be looking for me. - Hello. - May I speak with Sofia? I'm glad you came. He spoke a lot about you. Where is he? In his room. I'm glad they got to him in time. Was it intentional? I don't know. You need to ask him. Christian. Is it her, or am I hallucinating? No, I called her. - Did you get some sleep? - I don't know. Maybe a little. My mind goes wild suddenly. You're here, and I'm not even presentable. I see you're okay, so I'll just leave. No, no, no, stay. Don't let her leave. I need to take a shower. - Stay, we need to talk. - Christian, it's too late. This is an emergency. We need to talk. I'll pay you a month's therapy. Just stay! I didn't mean it that way. I meant to say I'd do whatever it takes, but I need to talk to you. I'll be right back. It's them, they've always worked for Navarro, ever since his first deals, they go way back. That's Major. Navarro's right-arm and gunman. The thug next to him is known as Diller. Knowing who these guys are won't help much. - We need proof to catch the culprits. - I'm doing what I can. It's a race against time to leave ASAP. - We need your statement! - I can't do that. You're our only hope to catch these guys. I do that and I'm dead. My sister died and you're running away? - Don't you want justice? - These guys control everything! The government, the money! We are nothing! We're powerless. They're so much stronger. We'll be conquered by fear. Hermes says governments should fear the people, not the other way around. But I saw how it works on the inside. - Messing with these guys is risky. - Screw that. I'm not quitting. After all that happened, you're here? All alone with me, at my place? Christian, do you realize that you could've died? You once said that I was very self-conscious. Remember? I think I got so stoned to blur that... crazy clarity with which I see everything around me. I owe you an apology. What I did to you was awful. Actually, everything I do is awful. You being in my apartment... is worse than a slap in the face. But even so, just you being here is so soothing. I feel so much at peace with you. Thank you. Did you try to kill yourself? With my tendency to ruin... everything I touch... it's only normal for me to do that. Don't you think? Christian, do you want to die? Ladies and gentlemen, the million-dollar question. I always get what I want. Whatever I see and desire, whatever I want has to be mine. Do I want to die? No. I'm good at whatever I do. If I wanted to die I would've succeeded. Christian, how can I help you? Do you forgive me? I'm here because I already forgave you. Now it's you who need to forgive yourself. Marco, you're still up? Where were you? I called you all night. I left my phone in the car. How convenient, right? Marco! This makes it complicated. I had to see a patient. It was an emergency. Some guy had an emergency on a Friday night? He's my patient. His therapist prescribed antidepressants with dangerous side-effects. It got ugly and he had no one else to go to. Damn! Totterman's Jorge Navarro is part of the scheme. I know who killed Renata. If I get upset and let you see I'm jealous, you'll think I'm immature, and you'll analyze my behavior. But you just vanished without saying a word. Forgive me. Am I alone in this? Excuse me? I'm always telling you how I feel about things, but you don't. There's so many things, all this that's going on. I'm not talking about that. I mean this, us. Whenever I touch you, I feel you're with me. I feel this is real. But it seems like you're running away, you're holding back, sabotaging your feelings. No, Marco, it's not that. I told you I wasn't ready. Honestly, I hear you saying all these things to me, with so much intensity, that I really don't know how to deal with it. Deal with passion? Have you by any chance asked yourself what you're feeling? You're not totally with me. Marco, we... We're living on different levels. You showed up with this fantasy that I'm quite unable to realize. This is all I have to offer at the moment. Then I'm leaving. I can't do this. You either devote yourself to me and we do this together, or I'm calling it quits. Apart from the scandal, Sofia Prado is involved in two murders. We need to sue them for spreading these lies. Sofia Prado's ex-husband, Jonas Bartelli, describes his stormy relationship with the sexologist. That bastard is talking! I'm going to kill Jonas! I'm in a total state of shock about what's happening to my ex-wife. Everything that's been said is totally unfounded. Sofia is a serious scholar who sacrifices her own life to help others. Her work is very important. - What's going on here? - Unbelievable. You either leave us alone, or I'll tell Sofia everything. - Look how I'm shaking. - You should be shaking. And you can take off your sheep's skin because I know the wolf in you wants blood, and I won't let you toy with Sofia again. You won't let me? I'm toying with Sofia? You actually seem to believe this part you're playing, the protector, the loyal friend. Look at yourself, honey. You really think you're that powerful? Think again. Who's in control here? Take care. You're a little upset. Excuse me. You slept with Jonas? When? Were we still married? No. Towards the end, you were getting divorced. You went to that conference in Amsterdam, remember? I stayed with Pedro and Jonas... I don't want to hear it. Don't tell me anything. I was in such a mess dealing with so many issues, trusting you with so many things, while you slept with my husband? Forgive me. I don't want to lose your trust over that. I want you to trust me again. I want you to trust me again as you always did. Trust, Miranda, is only lost once. I didn't betray you. I betrayed myself. It was such a huge mistake that I lost all my self-respect. I opened up a wound that... That won't heal. If you ever can, forgive me, because I will never be able to forgive myself. Every single day, I hear stories, complicated stories, problems, issues, terrible things. And I share their pain. I get attached. But listening to you... was more painful than any of those stories. And... for the first time in my life... I simply can't understand. Why? Why, Miranda, why? I've asked myself that a million times. I don't like men. You know that. I've only been with three. Two as a teenager and Jonas. So the reason why is very complicated and many years of therapy never found the answer. It wasn't Jonas' seduction games, I can tell you that. It wasn't out of love or lust, or a crush, nothing like that. That's precisely what hurts me! That it wasn't... It wasn't any sexual weakness. It was deliberate betrayal. The person I most trusted in the world betrayed me. I didn't betray you. I wanted to be closer to you. Unconsciously, I wanted to feel you through him. Forgive me, Sofia! Cassandra, did you take some cash from the safe? Yes, honey. I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you. 370 thousand dollars! I had to pay for that diamond and aquamarine set. What do you mean? Didn't you get those aquamarines a couple of months ago? Those were sapphires with something else. Our wedding present. No, no, this is too much. It's too much money! But I got a discount of more than 100,000 dollars! And you heard them say what a great investment it was, even to leave the country. We can't go just anywhere with all that cash, but we can with jewelry. Plus it's all in the safe. At least I can use the jewels. No, you can't use them. All of that attracts attention. And how do we explain it? How do we explain how we got it? Zairo, you are this country's most powerful man. Who's above you? Explain what to whom? It's not like that anymore. Those were different times. It's different now. Everybody's watching me. The feds, the media, the Treasury. They're all watching me, just waiting for me to slip, to come after me. You've got the whole country eating out of your hands, right? So... do you like my dress? Are you going out? It's Vilma's birthday party. I said you had a meeting. You hate this kind of thing. I'm exhausted! For the love of God, come home as soon as you can. You have several events to attend tomorrow. I can't take this anymore. These events are such a drag. It's the same thing every day. Visiting hospitals. Kids with cancer. Paraplegic old people. Soup kitchen inaugurations. Winter campaigns. It's so depressing, and I have to act like Mother Teresa of Calcutta, smiling, taking pictures. Please tell them to leave me alone. - I can't. - I can't take it anymore. It's important, it's fundamental for you to do your job, to become established as the First Lady. You need to show them all the social work you do. I know. And I do, don't I? I do, because it's important for your image. So I post tons of pictures online smiling at everybody. But you know what? It sucks! It sucks! And I've had it! You have no friends. Nobody tells the truth. People think you're nuts. They know. You ruined your career. Nobody can save you. Not even you. You can't get out of this. There's no way to escape. Nobody tells the truth. You ruined your career. People think you're nuts. You're not a good mother to Pedro, you never were, and you never will be. You can't look after your son all by yourself. Mainly because you don't know, you don't what you're saying. I had a... I had a hunch. It's just that... Nobody can save you, Sofia. I did it right, I tell you. I did it right. Your life affects mine! I can't stand it because it's not true. But I'm seeing... There's no way out. I see it, and I won't let you in. Sofia, just a moment, Sofia. Who knows what I know? Nobody knows what I see! You've never known what it's like to lose control of yourself. Because people are bad, evil. And looking like a madwoman! I said let me go! Get your hands off of me! Drop the gun or she dies. I'll have to kill both of you. Right? - Nobody can save you. - Look what you did! - You have no friends. - People think you're nuts. Look at what you did! - You have no friends. - People think you're nuts. That bitch! Long time no see, Sofia. You look great. I look great? Here I am dragging myself around, talking to an illusion. Because I know you're an illusion. Because I'm no fool. You know what I do when everything around me is falling apart? I grow wings! And I start flying. I levitate. I learned how to levitate. Come, let me show you. Let me show you how I can fly. I spread my wings like this and fly. I spread my wings and learned how to fly. Fly. I grew my wings. I spread my wings to fly. Fly. I grow wings. And I start flying. Those who were seen dancing were considered to be sick by those who couldn't hear the music. The voices. The visions. They are blessings. But it can also be a curse. Your fear of losing control is what makes you lose it. I levitate. I learned how to levitate. I don't want you to be hurt. I spread my wings and fly. I learned how to fly. To fly. I spread my wings... And learned how to fly. Your gift scares you. Accept your power, Sofia. Embrace the force of your psychic power. Trust your intuition. Come, Daniel, come with me, let me show you. I'll show you how I can fly. Okay then. I didn't have the time when I was leaving... I'll call you back. You're still up? You're... You're late. Honey! I'm sorry. I lost track of the time. I had a few cocktails too many. My God, they were so good! So good! You know what? We need to have fun, make the most of it while we're young and pretty. The least we can do in life is to be happy, right? It's not like I was born to be cooped up. I've had it with these social commitments and all those boring and annoying people. A bunch of useless events that do nothing for anybody. They played your favorite song. You don't dance with me anymore. Do you, Zairo? Everybody asked me about you.
