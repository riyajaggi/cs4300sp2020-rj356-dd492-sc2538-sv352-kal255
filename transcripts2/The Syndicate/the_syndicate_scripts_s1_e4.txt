 That don't even look real. I'm thinking of moving. You've won the Lottery. You should be shouting from the rooftops. It's not that simple. What about Stacey's dad? We never hear from him. It says "Leah", but I think they spelled your name wrong. Sorry to keep you waiting, ladies and gentlemen. What's your name? We are very proud to announce... How long have you been in a syndicate? What's your name, love? Leanne. Leanne what? Just Leanne. Are you married, Leanne? None of your business. What will you buy, Stuart? Two Ferraris.

 No, he's joking. A nice house for me and my family. Have you got a boyfriend? Any kids? I've got a daughter. Why? Our readers like to know these things. What's her name? I'd rather not say. Big smile please, Leanne. Look like you're enjoying yourself. Where in Wales are you from? North. Who are you going to share it with? I don't know, my family. Do they live in Wales? No. Can you ask someone else a question, please? STRING QUARTET PLAYS MAMBO Which room is it? Lady Windermere. It's just down there on the end. right. We'll clean your teeth in the morning, sweetheart. I hope she'll be all right. I don't know if I should leave her. It's just like leaving her upstairs in a house.

 But what if she wakes up? They'd hear her and come and get you. That's what a baby listening service is for. Come on, just for half an hour. The party's nearly over. Come on. You all right? Yeah. Oh, it's our Jamie! What are you two up to then? As if I need to ask. We've just put Stacey to bed. Right(!) We have. Don't, Leanne, he's off his face. Piss off! Anyway don't bother me what you get up to. I'm not your missus. All that sniff's given you brain rot. Tosser! Do you think she'll be all right? Yeah, don't worry. It was nice when Bob proposed, wasn't it? Yeah, I just hope he's all right. Hiya. I'm going to bed, cos I'm cream crackered. Stacey's in there, she's fast asleep. I'll try not to wake her. Where's Rodney? I don't know. He said he was coming upstairs to fetch his camera, but he never came back down. He must've gone to sleep. We've left the phone off the hook, cos there's a listening in service. Don't worry I'll put it back on. Hey! You don't think this is haunted, do you? Cos I've heard some of these old posh hotels have got ghosts. No. Doubt it. I won't be long anyway, I'm just going for one more drink. I'll be fast asleep anyway. Don't worry about me. Night. Night, Denise. See you in the morning. Bet he's still dancing, Bob, isn't he? Yeah, probably. We won't be needing the listening in service after all. No problem, I'll cancel it now. And have you got any rooms left? I thought you were booked in. I was going to drive, but I fancy a drink now... All our rooms are taken, sir, but we do have the Bramham Suite, if you're interested? Yeah. All right. Denise. Oh, Rodney, I thought you'd gone to bed. I wouldn't do that without saying goodnight. I rang work to make sure all the dogs were settled for the night and I mistakenly took my shoes off because my feet were hurting and now I can't get them back on. Oh, right, yeah. Mine do that as well. I think it's the alcohol. I've had them soaking in the bidet, but they don't seem to want to go back down. I was wondering if you fancied a nightcap? What sort of nightcap? They've left some sachets of hot chocolate. And some home-made little cookies. They're delicious. I don't mind if I do. Wow! Bloody hell! Would Madam care for a juniper cherry brandy or a Dusky Crow? Madam wouldn't like to mix her drinks or Madam will throw up. In that case would Madam care for another champagne? Now you're talking! Oh, hiya. Can I have a bottle of champagne, please? Yeah, Dom whatever would be great. Cheers. This suite's bigger than my whole flat. We're millionaires, Leanne! We're multi millionaires! Multi millionaires! We've won the bloody Lottery! I know! I can't believe it! Yes! Do you know something? This is the best I've felt since we won. Yeah, me too. KNOCKING Your champagne, sir. Bloody hell, that were quick. The suites have priority. Good evening, madam. Evening. Thank you, sir. Would you like me to light your fire? In the sitting room. Through here. Oh, my God! Imagine living somewhere like this. And having servants to light your fire. I can't get me brain around living in that house. Do you know I've been all day without a cigarette? Maybe it's because you're happy. I've got two nicotine patches on though. It's great about Bob going to South Africa, isn't it? Yeah, at least he stands a chance now. You never talk about you, do you? I've nothing to say. I just lead this boring life. Don't give me that, I bet you have blokes after you all the time. I haven't. I can't remember the last time I went out with a fella. What happened to Stacey's dad? He was a bit of a nutter. We used to have these big rows. The slightest thing'd set him off. He'd shout and... I don't really want to go into it all. Were you scared of him? Yeah, I suppose I was. Bastard. Does he ever ask about Stacey? I'm not in contact with him any more. We're better off without him. Too right. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret of mine. Go on. I've decided that I'm not gonna let you move away. Really? Mmm. Why? What you gonna do? I don't know. I'll think of summat. Like what? Like make you fall in love with me. You don't have to make me do that. What? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. What did you mean? No. I was being stupid. Nothing. I shouldn't have said anything. Just forget that. I don't want to forget it. Please don't move away, Leanne. I have to. Why? Why? Leanne, where you going? Leanne! Why did you suddenly race off? Because the only reason I'm still here is because of you, Stuart. Stacey? Stacey? Stacey, where are you? Denise! Stacey! Stacey! Stacey! Stacey! What's the matter? It's Stacey, she's gone. Denise... She's not there, they are not in the room. She won't be far. Stacey! What's up? I thought you were going back to the room. Is Stacey with you? No. No? Oh, my God. Where is she? Where's she gone? Rodney asked if I wanted a nightcap and... Why didn't you tell me, you idiot? I would never have left her like that. We'll find her. I'm sorry, I didn't think. What am I going to do? Where is she? They've taken her. Who's taken her? Leanne! Stacey! Stacey! Have you seen a little girl, fair hair, about this big? No. Did you tell them what room she was in? I don't know who you're talking about. Stuart. Check everyone's rooms. Right. I'll do me best. Stacey! Have you seen a little girl? Nobody in here, love. Oh, God, no! She can't have got far. We'll find her. Stacey! Oh, please, God, don't let them have taken her. Who are you on about? People that know I've got money, I've won the Lottery. They've kidnapped her. They're gonna... Leanne, nobody knows you were here. Oh, my God, she might have fallen into the lake. Stacey! Excuse me. I've got your daughter. Oh, my God. Stacey, where have you been? We found her wandering down the corridor. I woke up and I couldn't find you. But you're all right now, sweetheart. No thanks to you. Peter tried ringing you but it just rang out. Oh, God, I must've left it... Thanks for looking after her. That was so good of you. Oh, God, I shouldn't have left you. I don't know what I was thinking of. I'm sorry. Come on, let's get you back to bed. What can I do? Nothing. She'll be all right in the morning. Yeah, but I feel like I've really let her down. It's not your fault. But she trusted me. Where am I going to sleep tonight now? You'll have to sleep in my room. It's all right - there's a sofa. Come on. I'm sorry I left you. It was only for ten minutes. I promise I'll never do it again. It's all right. You get some sleep now, my little angel. 'I forgot to give you this. It came to the shop.' Phone. Cheers. Are you all right? I am now. You said the only reason you were still here were cos of me. It was the champagne. Forget it. Right. OK. No-one's gonna take your daughter, Leanne. How do you know? Cos I do. You can't carry on living your life thinking that. I'm going to bed now. I'm tired. I'll see you in the morning, Stuart. Morning. Morning. I thought you be having a lie in, what with not being at work any more. No, I want to get back home, get things sorted. What are you doing up so early? Work. It's Saturday. It's Denise's last day. She's having a drink afterwards. I won't be going. Right. I'm going to ballet when I get home. Well, aren't you lucky? Can I come? No, silly. Big men don't go to ballet. That's where you're wrong, because I do a mean pirouette. So how you getting back? I've ordered a taxi. I can give you a lift, if you want. No, it's all right, it's coming now. Morning. Morning. Hiya. Morning. I'm really sorry about last night, Leanne. Can I give you something towards the hotel room? No, it's fine. You're still mad, aren't you? Sugarwell Hill, please. I'll ring you, yeah? I feel awful. I think she's pissed off with all of us. She's got this thing in her head that someone's gonna take Stacey. Take her? Yeah, kidnap her for the Lottery money. Is that why she won't go anywhere without her? Cheers. Keep the change. Thank you very much. Come on, Stacey. Come on. Stop looking at him. Is that man following us? Come on, Stacey. Who is he? I don't know. Stay there. He's coming. Quick come on, come on. That's £7.10, please. Do you want a Lottery ticket or scratch card? Yeah, go on then, I'll have a Lucky Dip. Why not. This is the shop to do it. Some of your good luck might rub off. You never know. That's £8.10 then, please. I didn't think any of you would be still working here. There'll only be me after the end of today. We finish at end of month, so I'm gonna stick it out. £1.90. Cheers. So Leah's left, has she? Who? Sorry, I think you know her as Leanne. Oh, right, yeah. Why, do you know her? I'm married to her. I don't think so. Nearly nine years now, mate. Only she was Leah Powell back then. I saw her in the newspaper celebrating your win. Yeah, well, this ain't her. It is. She's made a good job at changing her image, but I'd know her anywhere. I don't think she wants to know you. Amazing how people come out of the woodwork when... I'm not looking for money. I just need to make contact. I sent a letter but she hasn't got back to me. Have you got a number? Oh, like I'm just gonna give it you! She's 35 minutes late now. What you gonna do, sack her? My number's on the back. Ask her to give me a call, please. It's really important. Cheers. If I wasn't short staffed, I'd tell Denise not to bother coming in. She's doing you a favour. She's got nearly £4 million in the bank. She didn't want to leave you in the lurch. I don't care how much she's got in the bank. What did he want? Just some bloke asking for Leanne. Not another one. We had a bloke in last night asking where she lived. You didn't tell him, did you? Did I hell! I don't know her number. I just said flats at top of Sugarwell Hill. I wasn't sure which. You are such a wanker. I beg your pardon! So let me get this straight. You told a complete stranger where an employee lives? She's not an employee any longer. You've worked for Right Buy U for what, 20 years? 22. Do you wonder why they haven't given you a store? Because I'm more useful to them as a floater. Yeah, one that won't flush down the toilet. I think you'd better take that back, young man. You owe me an apology. What's up? Well, where are you? Excuse me, I'm talking to you? You walk out of this shop now, you needn't bother coming back. Come on, we've got to go. What's the matter? There's someone looking for you. What? He came into the shop. You must have just missed him. Me car's round the back. Give us that. It's ever so good of you to have given me a lift home. My pleasure. Thank you for inviting me to such a splendid party last night. Oh, no, you don't have to get out of the car. Of course I do. You all right? Yeah, it's just a bit of sciatica. I could've slept on the settee. CAR HORN What's he doing now? He should be in work! I'd better go. Denise, about last night. I'm a little bit late and they're short-staffed. Yes, I'm sorry, I won't keep you. I just wanted to say I knew you were upset and I didn't want to take advantage of the situation, that's all. No, thank you very much for giving up your bed for me. Not that I wanted to... I mean not, not give up my bed for you... I mean I would've loved to have taken advantage... I'm sorry, I'm not very good at these things. Are you saying you like me or you don't? Of course I like you. But you're not attracted to me? No, I am! Is that a yes or a no? Yes! Just didn't want to appear too forward, that's all. I'm sorry if I've made you later than you already... No, it's all right. It's my last day. I'm having a drink after work in The Bridge. You could join us if you like. It'll be just a couple of us. I don't know if Leanne's coming now. I'd like that very much. I'll see you after seven. And what the bloody hell time do you call this? Leaving time! Look, I know that you're short-staffed, so I can either stay and help you, or I can go home, take me dogs out for a walk, put me feet up and watch telly. Choice is yours. Stay. Please. Please. I'll put me tabard on. What you going on first? I am going to go in there. Have fun. MOBILE PHONE RINGS Amy? I can't deal with her right now. She'll just want to bollock me for not coming home last night. Who was the man outside your flat? I've no idea. Think it's anything to do with yer husband? What husband? The one that came into the shop. I'm not married. You are. His number's on the back, he wants you to ring him. Don't lie to me, Leanne. If nothing else, I'm your friend, You can tell me anything. I'm not ringing him. Don't, then. What do you think he wants? Money? To get me back? I don't know. Do you want me to ring him? No! I just want him to go away. That's why I've got to leave here. That's why I didn't want to go public about the win and have my picture plastered all over the papers. SHE SIGHS I wish to God I'd stuck to my guns and said no. Well, it's too late now, innit? I need someone to go to the flat and get my things. And then what? I'll get on a train somewhere, start again. So you'll run from him all your life? I'm not running from him. You are! You're gonna take Stacey out of school, move away from all your mates, all because he knows where you live? You don't understand. No, I don't. There's something you're not telling me. Is it Stacey? What do you mean? Has he got visiting rights? He's got no rights. He doesn't care about her. He's her dad. No, he's not. I thought... You thought wrong. That's part of the problem. Sorry, I didn't mean to... Look, I'll take you to our house then I'll go and get yer stuff. I can go in a hotel. I'd rather you be with me. I mean, it's better you're with people in case... What will Amy say? She won't be happy, but then she never is. I wouldn't worry about it. I'll just buy her another handbag. Look at the size of the houses! This is our house. Oh, my God. It's like a mansion. What the hell's he doing here? Are we going to live here? No we're just staying here tonight. Hello! Anybody home? I thought you were at work. Oh, hello, love! Hiya. You remember Leanne from the shop. Course I do. And this is her daughter, Stacey. Hello, sweetheart! Hello! Where's Amy? Gone back to bed. She's been throwing up. She came in at five o'clock this morning, plastered. Then she set the alarm off and woke us all up. I'll just get the little one a biscuit. Our Jamie's here. So I gathered. Come through. Hey! Get your own house, you pillock! Don't want me own house, shithead. I've got a pad above the club. And what are you doing wearing my dressing gown? I've just been in t'pool and didn't want to drip on your floor. There's a good girl... Hey, Leanne, how you doing? All right. She's staying here for a bit. Oh, yeah? Her flat's flooded. Good do last night. Bob was on form. Yeah, considering. Say thank you. You got off early. Debbie were doing me head in. Hey now, cowboy, you been a good boy for nana? Apart from being woken up in t'middle of night and that weren't his fault. If you hadn't set the bloody alarm... We could've been robbed... You did it on purpose, you knew I were coming back. What are you lot all doing here? Shall we go into t'room? Been phoning you all morning. What's the point of having a phone if you don't even use it? I were serving. I'm more important than the bloody shop! Don't know what you're still working there for anyway! I might not be now. Think I've just been sacked. Oh, Hallelujah! It wasn't 'cos of me, was it? Why would it be to do wi' you? You did me a favour. I needed an excuse to tell him where to stick it. Excuse me? I asked a question. I asked Stuart if he'd help me. Do what? We need to talk in private. Bit difficult, cos this house is becoming like a drop-in centre! I think I'll just go... No, you won't. Mam, make her a brew. Come and sit down, love. Don't look so worried. She's always a cow when she's hungover. Amy. I'm not stupid. I never said you was. So why didn't you come home last night? Because I wanted a drink... You didn't even ring me. I knew you were out! If I find out you've been messing me about... I'm not! What's she doing here, then? I said she could stay for a bit. Just in case you hadn't noticed, I live here, too! Her husband's found out where she lives and he's hounding her. You know something? You're a crap liar. I'm not lying. Look. He came into t'shop, looking for her. He wants to get back in touch with her. His number's on t'back. She looks completely different. So, if he don't know how to get in touch with her how can he know where she lives? Cos Jimmy told him. Look, it's just till we get her sorted. What's that mean? I'll go and get all her stuff and if it's all right with you, I'll bring it back here. Do I have a choice? Course you do! Are we going to ballet, Mummy? I'm not sure, darling. Maybe. Oh, please! I always wanted a little girl to take to ballet, but I got two boys instead. Cheers, Mam(!) I like your gun. Is it real? No, he's got a better one than that. Go get the one Aunty Joan bought you for Christmas, Jack. He's mad about guns. So, what you bought with your money so far? Oh, er, nothing really. Few clothes, that's all. I'm going to buy a house when I get settled. Every week I think about what I'd spend the money on if I won. Yeah, I used to do that. It's weird, it's more fun thinking about what you'll spend the money on than when it really happens. It must be nice having two rich sons to treat you, though. I haven't seen a penny off either of 'em yet! I'll buy you a holiday and driving lessons - what more do you want? I best get off. Have you got a door key? If you drop me off at St Michael's, I can take Stacey to ballet and check the train times for tomorrow. You shouldn't wander around Headingley on your own. I'll be OK. You could pick us up after. I've got my phone on me. There, look at that! You'd think that was real, wouldn't you? Yeah! I thought I'd taken them off him. He wanted them back. I don't like him having guns. All lads play with guns. We had guns. You want to try having one shoved in your face! Stuart! He were just playing! Why you making a big thing of it? It's just a toy. Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Got you! As you can see, he's white and about your build. There's thousands of blokes that are thin like me. I'd know if it were my own brother. I'm sure you would. Swear to God, come two years, me brother'll be stone-broke again. Sunk a million into a lap-dancing club. Got a Ferrari, a Porsche, and he's back on Charlie. Is that what he was in trouble with the police for? Yeah, but other stuff. He's always in debt to someone. You don't think he had anything to do with the robbery? What, at the shop? Yeah. No. He's an idiot, but he's harmless. I don't mean like he did it but he could've told someone that we had money in the safe. Nah, he wouldn't do that to me. He left first and he said he was going out straight from work. When Denise told you about the lottery win, he was still in his uniform. He changed his mind. I think a lass rang him. Why didn't he tell the police that? I don't know. D'you want me to wait for you? No, it's all right. I've got to go in and explain to her teacher she won't be coming again. I'm not going to ballet any more? We'll find you a new ballet class, sweetheart. So where shall I meet you? Back here in about an hour. Right. I'll go get yer stuff and drop it off at t'house. Thank you. It's all in the hall, by the door. Two big suitcases and some bags. Everything else, just leave. It either belongs to the woman I rent the flat off, or I don't need it. So you were all packed up then? Yeah, I'd, I'd given notice. I was leaving anyway. Come on. Where you going with that? I'm putting 'em in t'sauna to dry. You're not! Put 'em in tumble dryer. Costs a fortune doing that! Sauna's already on. I don't want them in the sauna. Please yourself. Put 'em where you like, but she's running out of vests. I'm making some soup if you want some. Great. What are you still doing here? That's a nice way to talk to your future brother-in-law. I'm checking me and you are cool. Why wouldn't we be? MOBILE PHONE BEEPS That's a first. Dumped by text. Thought you said Debbie weren't your girlfriend. Obviously she thought she was. Was she pretty? Not really. She had great tits, though. That's her dancing' at... Oops! Better not show you that one. What is it? Nothing. Come on. Is it dirty? No comment. There's nothing you could show me that'd shock me. I think this would. Really? Yeah, cos it's your old man. Stuart? I'm kidding. Let me see. Hmph! Give it here Jamie. I'm serious. Hey, don't drip on my phone! What are they doing? I'm saying nothing. Excuse me, is it possible for you to drive me to Scotland? Scotland? Or Cornwall, if it's easier. Cornwall?! I'll take you wherever you want, love. Get in. Not now. Tomorrow morning, if that's OK? This is my mobile, yeah? Cheers, thanks. Scotland! HE LAUGHS When did Stuart drop all this stuff off? About ten minutes ago. You were in the shower. Don't know how to work these blooming Aga things. So if I pass me test, you going buy me a car? You've got two sons, mam. If I buy you lessons, our Stu can get you a car. Our Stuart's been good to me. I've got my own room and I can have anything I want. Don't have to pay rent or anything. Cos you look after their kids. You're a cheap nanny. Anyway, I've bought into t'club now, so I need me money. I'm yer mam. I've had a lot to put up with all these years, bailing you out of trouble, having me doors kicked in. What do you want, a medal? I want a car! When I was getting ready to move here I was clearing everything out and I found something at the bottom of your wardrobe. Porn DVD? Drugs? What you talking about? Be careful, little ears! I thought it were a shoe bag for your posh trainers at first and then I looked at it carefully and it dawned on me what it was - a cash bag. Right. I'm off. A little red Mini with a hood would be nice. You can pay for the tap separately or pay for them together, which we prefer. If I give you 80 now, can I give you the rest next week? I'll make a note of it. All right, OK. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. Do you know where Stacey is? Yes, she went about five minutes ago with her daddy. What?! He said you asked him to pick her up. My God, why didn't you check? She seemed very happy to go with him. What's the matter, where's Stacey? He's taken her. Who? Gareth. He's changed his number. Where's that photograph? I don't know, I gave it to Amy. What for? I need it! Ring her! Oh, God! I knew something like this'd happen. We should ring the police. No, no, I don't want that. It's against the law. You can't just take a kid. How did he know she was at ballet? No idea. RINGING TONE PHONE RINGS Mam, can you put Amy on? All right. It's our Stuart, he wants to talk to you. What do you want? Got that photograph? What photograph? The one I showed you with t'number on back. What do you want it for? 'Just give me the number.' Why should I? 'Cos I'm telling you to.' 'You lied to me.' What you on about? Are you with her? I'm trying to help her. What's she saying? I've looked on the internet. There's things you should know about lovely Leah. I need that number, Amy! Tough! SHE SLAMS DOWN PHONE What's happening? Has she gone to get it? It's all right. PHONE RINGS That's my phone! Stuart? Yes, yes. Leave it to me. Right, madam. You either give me that number or I'll tell our Stuart you were messing around with someone in t'pool at five o'clock this morning. Oh, very nice, very nice! And we also go to ballet after school. Ballet? Wow, that's fantastic! Do you know what? I am a brilliant ballet dancer! I didn't know you were my daddy. You were only two when you left. When's Mummy coming? Looks like she's here now. Mum! How many times have I told you never to go anywhere with someone you've just met? He is my daddy. Well, he isn't. What are you doing? Stuart, get off! Why are they fighting? Get off him! Don't! Stop it! Don't look, don't look. But he took Stacey! No, SHE took Stacey! Please, not in front of... What's that suppose to mean? Look, I don't care what you did! That's all in the past! I've been trying to contact you since I saw you in the newspaper, cos I need you to sign these divorce papers. My girlfriend's pregnant. We want to marry before the baby's born. You're going to have, you're going to be a father? Yeah. So you see, it wasn't my fault. I never said it was. Will someone tell me what's going on? There's a man that's been hanging around the flat where I live. Yeah! Someone my solicitor's been in touch with up here. He's been looking for you for a week. He was supposed to serve you the papers, but... Who told you where Stacey was? Some woman rang me. I didn't catch her name. If you just sign the papers, I'll go and you'll never see me again. Oh, cheers. Bye-bye, Stacey. Are you not going be my daddy any more? I was just a pretend daddy, darling, but you know what? You're really lucky, cos you've got a great mummy to look after you. Thanks, Gareth. I'm glad things worked out for you. You too. Have you told anybody where...? No, not a soul. I'm sorry I let you down. You didn't. Just wasn't right for me. I don't get it. What did you do? Can we go and see the butterflies? Yes, why not? We tried for two years for a baby. We had IVF and everything. It just, just didn't happen. So we decided to foster first, and if that went well, we were going to try and adopt. You and Gareth? Yeah. They explained things to us, and I thought I could handle it. We talked about it. We had a little cottage. Gareth had started up on his own as a plumber, getting plenty of work. We thought we could give a child a break and help the parents. So is Stacey adopted? They rang us on the Monday night and told us they had a brand new baby that needed fostering. The mother was an addict. She already had three children that she couldn't manage. We collected Stacey from the hospital the next morning and... What I didn't bank on, was just... the feeling I got when they put her in my arms and she looked up at me and I just... It's all right. You don't have to tell me. I'm sorry, I do. I have to tell someone. I can't keep this to myself any longer. We'd had her for nearly two years. We'd nursed her through teething, croup, everything. It was three weeks before the final hearing and we'd been told if it went well, we'd be able to adopt her and then just... Just out of the blue, the birth mother asked to see her again. I mean, I really tried to be strong, but I just... I couldn't. I couldn't give her up. On the morning I knew they were coming to take her, I just grabbed some things and I left. Without Gareth? He couldn't do it. And I've been on the run ever since. Mum, it's on my finger! There's a fantastic house on The Avenue. It's got a tree house in the garden. Can we see it? We'll see. What the bloody hell's going on? That's all my stuff! We'll need to... What's Leanne's things doing on the drive? Threw them out. I don't want them in the house. Now then, Stuart. What's up? This is Philippa Fentham. She's a social worker from the family unit. Right, what's she doing here? Do you know where Leah Powell is? No idea who you're talking about. He's talking about Leanne. Little Miss Perfect(!) She's Leah Powell. She took someone's baby... Amy! She's a kidnapper! We don't know that. Says on t'internet. Shut yer mouth! No, I bloody won't! Her husband told me she did a runner with the kid. She's a criminal, needs locking up! Could I just get a word in edgeways? So, I've told the police everything. Until we interview Mrs Powell... Don't believe a word she says. She's mental, she's making it up! I'm not! And another thing, I don't want that bitch near my kids! Excuse me! Can I speak? What if she kidnaps Daisy or Jack? Do either of you have any idea where Leanne, Leah, whoever, is? I'm here. Was your former name Leah Powell? Yes. I'm arresting you, Leah... What? ..on suspicion of child abduction. I don't believe this! Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Jesus Christ, are you happy now? Got what you wanted? You have no idea what you've just done! We've contacted the South Wales police and they're on their way. In the meantime, we'd like you to accompany us down to the station. What about Stacey? That's why Philippa's here. I don't want to leave her. We could take her to a residential home... I don't want that! Or if you have any relatives that live nearby? I don't have anyone. We can look after her. No, we won't. It's not up to you. Me and me mam'll do it between us. You going to choose her over me and yer children? I'm not choosing anyone. You make me sick! Is it all right if she stays with us? We'll have to do some police checks first. Me mam's a dinner lady and she's had all that stuff done. Stacey, would you like to stay at... Stuart. At Stuart's house for a little bit, while Mummy helps us answer some questions? It won't be for long, darling. Are you having a sleepover, Mum? I don't know, I might be, but I'll... Hey, you could stay in Daisy's room, it's got fairy lights. Do you want to come and have a look? I'll see you soon. Always remember...I love you. She'll need a solicitor. Hiya. Is that Peter? Hiya, I met you last night at yer dad's party. It's a Joyce Bradley. It's Stuart - I used to work with Bob. A dinner lady at Sugarwell Hill Primary. Stuart! Can you just hang on a minute? ..I'm up here, Mam! What's going on out there and who's she? I'll tell you in minute. Look after Stacey while I take this call? Yes, and check her son and his partner... Sorry about that. I was just talking to me mam. I had your number on me mobile from when you rang about the party. It's me friend, she needs a solicitor and I don't know anybody else except you. Come and see what we've bought. Well, she needs one straight away really - we've got money, so we can pay for the best. It's a Welsh case, so it's nothing to do with us. What if the Welsh police don't arrive until the morning? She's distressed because she's not with the child, the child's distressed cos she's not with the mother. What if she bolts again? She's got money. She can get on a plane with the kid and fly anywhere. She hasn't any previous, she's never been in trouble in her entire life, she's going to get section 47/3 bail tomorrow anyway, so... Fine, it's their call, not mine. Look, I like the girl, I feel sorry for her... But you're going to keep her in a cell overnight? Well, I'm not inviting her home for tea. What you looking at? Somebody I don't know any more. I'm the mother of your children, that's who I am. You've changed, Amy. Oh, and you haven't? Well, the Stuart that I know and fell in love with would never have shagged someone else. I haven't shagged anyone... Don't give me that, your Jamie's got a photo of you and her sneaking into a hotel room. You're lying. Ring him, he'll show you. Well he's just trying to mix it between us. Anyway you were the one that didn't come in till five o'clock this morning. You mean while you were out shagging the child snatcher? I don't want you in this house any more. Well tough, cos I'm not going anywhere. This is as much my house as it is yours. If you don't want to be with me, you can piss off. Remember you don't have to say anything, in fact it's probably better if you wait for my colleague, he's a specialist in child custody and it's not really my field, but... So Leanne, I've decided that we'll start the interview when the Welsh team get here. I'm afraid our accommodation's a bit grim, but for now it's all I can offer you. We'll try and get you out tomorrow. That will depend on the CP and Inspector Owen. Can I speak my daughter? She's entitled to a phone call. Please. He's not answering his phone. He shot off earlier, didn't even say ta-rah. Yeah, cos he knows I'm going to kick his head in. What's he done now? Causing trouble as usual. He took a photo of me and Leanne at the hotel and showed it to Amy. PHONE RINGS Hello, are you all right? Yeah, just a minute. HE SWITCHES TV OFF Stacey, it's your mam. 'Stacey?' Stacey, are you there? Stacey, it's Mummy. Talk to me, Stacey. Are you coming to Stuart's house to pick me up? I might have to stay here for a little bit, angel, but Stuart and his mummy will look after you till I get back Now. Your pyjamas and your toothbrush are in your wheelie case, OK? And your reading book and your DS, they're in the front compartment. Can you hear me, Stacey? Are you still there? Don't be cross with me, sweetheart. Stacey, I want to be with you, I'd give anything to be with you now, but...I can't. Mummy's got to go now, OK? So don't forget to clean your teeth. And I love you. I love you, too. SHE KISSES PHONE I got it - night-night, babe. Night-night. Thank you. Will you watch them, while I go out a bit? Don't go looking for our Jamie. I won't. It's Denise's leaving do, I said I'd go. I'll have to let her know what's going on. Come here Jack, give us a cuddle. Night-night. It'll be all right, Stacey. I think it's bed time, kids. Don't worry, we'll try and get you interviewed first thing and then hopefully you should be out of here by tomorrow lunchtime at the latest. Well it seems like DCI Owen's driver must've put his foot on the gas, cos she's here, so we'll continue the interview if that's OK? It's up to you. The sooner we get it over with, the sooner we get you back to Stacey. Let's not jump the gun and raise her hopes, we don't know if it'll be possible. What do you mean? What? They may decide Stacey should be returned to her natural mother. She doesn't know her! It wouldn't be in the interest of the child. All I'm saying is we can't second-guess what's going to happen. The birth mother is a known drug user, she couldn't manage the children she had. Now, I'm pretty sure that neither DCI Owen nor the magistrate will want another Baby P on their hands. I'm a student, I am just waitressing to earn a bit of money through uni. Right, well we don't get many students in here. I'm part owner of this place, so what I'm really after are some quality.... You outside! Piss off, I'm talking. This is a designer suit, you tosser. Did you show Amy a photo of me and Leanne on yer phone? Did you?! I don't know what you're talking about. Show me your phone. What for? Cos you're a lying bastard, that's why. You do anything like that again and I'll kill you. I've told you three times, I went to Swansea Station and I got on the first train that was leaving. Even though you knew what you were doing was wrong? You don't have to answer that. I thought what I was doing was right. Stacey always got upset if I had to leave her, even if it was with my husband. She's a mummy's girl, and I just knew she'd scream the place down and I couldn't stand to.... OK, my client's been answering questions now for over an hour and a half. It's clear there was no pre-meditated intent, it was a moment of maternal instinct to protect the child that she'd nursed and nurtured for the best part of two years. Right now we have a distressed child. It would be in the best interests of all concerned to return the mother as soon as possible. So bearing that in mind, I'd like to suggest bail pending further investigation. I just wanted to explain why she was so wound up last night. I'm glad you did. That explains it all, don't it? Why she wouldn't leave Stacey with anyone else and why she always kept herself to herself. Yeah, well, she's going to need as much support as she can get right now. Yeah. Are you sure I can't get you another drink? No, it's all right, my mum's got the kids, I'd best get back. Thank you I just wanted you to know before you found out from anyone else. If you need any help at all, I'm only doing two days a week at the dogs home. Can I ask you something? Course you can. Did you vote for me to get the Lottery money? Course I did. It were me and you that started the syndicate. Honestly, Stuart! MOBILE PHONE RINGS It's basically a difficult one - she's been accused of abducting a child... Stuart! Leanne! Come here. Are you all right? I think so. I'm so sorry, Leanne. It's me that should be saying I'm sorry for all the lies I told you. No, I understand why you couldn't tell us the truth, but we'd have been there for you, wouldn't we, Stuart? 100%. I thought you'd think I was a terrible person. No! We'd never think that. We're your friends. I just don't understand how you managed for all of those years? I just took one step at a time, I rented a flat and only went out when I had to. But what did you do about work? I've always worked from home or somewhere they didn't ask questions. Didn't Bob ask for your National Insurance number? I made it up. You made it up? I kept expecting him to get back to me, but he never did. Oh my giddy aunt, wait till he finds out about that! So what's going to happen? I'm out on bail. Will you take me to see Stacey? Yeah, course. Hi, mate. These are your bail conditions, Leanne. So you're all right getting home? Yeah, I'll take her. Car's outside. Thanks for everything, mate. No problem. I'll be in touch soon as we've a date for the magistrates. I'll give Nigel Crawford your details, he's the best barrister I know. I can't thank you enough. Don't be silly, it's my job. I'm glad Stuart got in touch. I didn't know anybody else. Next time you see my dad, put a good word in for me will you? Of course. Did he get his flight all right? Yes, they'll be still in the air actually. I'll keep you posted. See you later. Bye. I've got to report to a police station every day until the court hearing. Our Jamie had to do that. I'll come with you. I've got to go now cos Rodney's in the car waiting. I'll call you. Yeah, do. All right. Bye. See you, Denise. So Stacey can stay with you, yeah? For now. I had to give them an address that I could be bailed to, so I gave them yours. I hope that's all right? Yeah, course it is. Mummy's back, my little angel. So you've chosen her, have you? Stuart, did you hear what I said? I don't want to talk to you right now. Well, I want to talk to you. I didn't stay for a sleepover after all. For heaven's sake, Bob, it is not going to be your last day, so get that out of yer head. My God, I'm going to lose her. Want a lift? Yeah! You think you're invincible now you've won the Lottery. There's a business opportunity that's sailing our way. One I'd like to share with someone who wants to invest. You knew they were waiting for me. You couldn't give a shit, could you?
