 (narrator) Long ago, Earth's greatest ninja sacrificed himself to keep the universe safe from the monster Galvanax. Ten years later, the Rangers fought many battles to protect the legendary Ninja Power Stars. Finally, Galvanax was defeated. But the ruthless Madame Odius survived and rose to power, determined to take the stars for herself. Only one team of heroes can stop her. It's Morphin' Time! (narrator) They are "Power Rangers: Super Ninja Steel."

 (Tynamon) Here's the plan. I'll combine six skullgators into a mega monster using your magic mallet. And the Ranger's Fusion Star? And they don't know it's missing. Too slow! Aah! (grunting) Finders keepers. (with German accent) Your plan will never work! She's just jealous. I'm gonna destroy the Rangers and get you the Power Stars. Very impressive, Tynamon. That truly is a brilliant plan.

 Yes, I know! But Badonna is right. What? Why wouldn't it work? You should know that their Ninja Stars respond to their voices. Their voices? Yes, only their voices. But don't give up. You know our deal. You'll get your secret little wish when you get me results. Ha! The chances of that are teeny-weeny. Just watch me, missy. If I need a Ranger's voice, then I'll steal one. Ta-da! This is the Super Star mode star. It works with your gold energy when you add it to the Super Star blade that Sarah made. (Levi) Nice! Wow, a new mode for me? Yes, siree. Cool. Give it a try. All right. Ninja-- (high-pitched beam) (Brody) Levi! (Tynamon laughing) Tynamon used some kind of spell on you. Are you okay? (with Tynamon's voice) I'm fine. Aren't I? Wait. My voice! What did you do to my brother? (laughing) (with Levi's voice) Isn't it obvious? Oh, don't I sound great? I've got the voice of a Ranger. (laughing) He sounded just like you. Tynamon must have switched my voice with his. ♪♪ ♪ Go... go ♪ ♪ Power Rangers Ninja Steel ♪ ♪ Crushing evil with all my might together ♪ ♪ Ninja Steel ♪ ♪ Never give up without a fight together ♪ ♪ Ninja Steel ♪ ♪ Ninja rangers fear no danger ♪ ♪ Go, go Power Rangers ♪ ♪ Go, go Power Rangers ♪ ♪ Go ♪ ♪ Standing up for what is right together ♪ ♪ Ninja Spin ♪ ♪ Watching your back day or night together ♪ ♪ Ninja Steel ♪ ♪ Ninja Rangers fear no danger ♪ ♪ Go, go Power Rangers ♪ ♪ Go, go Power Rangers ♪ ♪ Go Ninja Steel ♪ ♪ Go... go ♪ ♪ Power Rangers Ninja Steel ♪ ♪ Go, go Power Rangers ♪ ♪ Go, go Power Rangers ♪ ♪ Go Ninja Steel ♪♪ I just don't get it. Why would the monster mess up your voice? Well, the Ninja Stars respond to Ranger voices. Without his voice, Levi can't work. So, it's one less Ranger to fight. Plus, I sound awful. My singing career is toast. Don't say that. Preston... Mm-hm? You said Tynamon put a spell on me. Is that right? Yeah. Well, you can do magic. So, how about reversing it? Uh... I need my voice back. It's not that simple. I don't know what spell to use. So it's harder for me to undo it. Will you, at least, try? Please? Yeah. Sure. I'll, uh... I'll check my spell books. Thanks. Man, I sound ridiculous. (Vic) Ridiculous? You can say that again. (laughing) You-- you sound like a chipmunk. Very funny. (high pitched voice) Man, that's screechy. Somebody get this man some oil. (mouthing) Stop it. Guys, Levi is... sick. He has... Tynamonitis... of the throat. Oh, no. Is he, uh... contagious? Oh, yeah. Very contagious. Smile and back away. He could infect the whole school. I don't want to catch it. I know just what we need. Come on. Ah! Ah! Hey, Mick. Uh, well? Can you get my voice back for me? Um, here. I found the spell in-- in my work, but... dark magic is really powerful. Preston, please. Just try it. I can't stand listening to this screechy voice. Okay, okay. (Preston) All right. (clears throat) Let's hope this works. Evago tarandaba... Help Levi speak once more, put him back to how he was before! Oh! Ah... Oh, no! Oh, yes! He is back to how he was before. Like, ten years before. Oh! Preston! I'm a kid. Hey, at least we can still see you. Remember Preston? You turned me invisible. I--I-- I don't know what went wrong. Try another spell. (Levi) No way! You'll probably turn me into a pumpkin. (laughing) Okay, don't worry, Little Levi. We'll help Presto go through the books. Yeah, we'll find the right spell to fix you. Yeah. Of course we will. Someday. So, I guess for now you are my little brother, huh? Yeah, very funny. (alarm blaring) (laughing) Oh, no! What is it, Mick? Uh, buzzcams detected in the city. Let's go, guys. It could be Tynamon. Oh, Levi. You should probably stay here until you can morph again. Hey, uh, maybe Redbot can read you a bedtime story. (all laughing) Very funny. Sorry. Would you really like me to read to you? No, it's a joke, Redbot. Oh. I'm gonna go out and get some air. (Levi) See you later. (with Levi's voice) Welcome, Rangers. Are you ready? It's time to begin. Hey, that's our Ninja Fusion star! Where did you get that? You should remember, because you're the one who dropped it. What? No way! I just can't wait to use it. The star will never work for a monster. Will it? Yes, it will. Because he has Levi's voice. Ninja Fusion star, lock in! Turns out Tynamon is a genius. Let's give him a bunch of skullgators! (buzzer) (cheering) Skullgators, combine! Ninja Spin! (Calvin) Oh, no! (growling) Megamauler, ready! Oh, this is bad. Really bad. Oh, this is bad. Really bad. Oh, yes, it's bad. And it's beautiful. I'm Megamauler and I'll flatten everything. Not us. (all) Ninja Spin! ♪♪ (grunting) Ninja Steel Megazord combine! Ninja Spin! (Brody) Ninja Steel Megazord ready! Ninja Super Steel mode, ready! (grunting) He's coming right at us! Oh! Ah! Oh, woha! The Megazord it's becoming unstable. It's gonna break apart! (all) Ah! (laughing) (Hayley) He blew right through our Megazord. There's no way we can beat a monster that was created by the Fusion Star. Preston, you have to find a way to break Tynamon spell a get Levi's voice back. Right! I'll do my best. Let's get back to the base. Hey! Where the Rangers go? (Tynamon) You let them escape? You fool! Oh, yeah? How's this for foolish? I'll crush you instead! That's enough! I better shrink your ego down a size. Oh, no! What's happening? How dare you shrink me down? Me? You're the one who let the Rangers get away. You're worthless. You belong in the trash. Ow! Ah! Oh! I've had enough of you, old man! I'm outta here! You won't get away that easy. (distant thunder) Uh... Yo, can you kick the ball to me? (with Tynamon voice) Sure, here you go. (laughing) Dude, you've got the weirdest voice. Did you guys hear that? Yeah. (mockingly) "Sure, here you go, I'm a weirdo." Leave him alone, Casey. So what if he sounds different? Yeah, right. Whatever. You okay? Those guys can be pretty mean. I'm fine. That was really nice of you. I just have this... cold. I'm uh... Aiden. I'm Rosie. I know how it is. People tease me about my red hair all the time. Plus, they never let me play ball with them. But I don't let it get to me. Really? What's your secret? Simple. I just remember the words to my favorite song. ♪ When times are tough and words are rough ♪ ♪ What's inside is the key ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ I'm happy to be me ♪ That's my song. I mean... That's my favorite song. You like Levi Weston too? Oh, yeah. He's, uh... ...great. I've sung those lyrics lots of times. But now they mean even more to me. You know? Yeah, they mean a lot to me too. You are to listen to Levi's music more carefully. You're right. I should. (cell phone chiming) I gotta go. My dad just texted me. It was good to meet you, Aiden. You're cool. Thanks, you're very cool too. Bye. Hope you feel better. What on Earth are you wearing? Oh, these are custom-made biohazard suits. With these on, we're perfectly protected from the plague that's sweeping through this school. Oh! Yes, the plague. (coughing) (Monty) Oh! (coughing) Victor, let's get out of here. (coughing) (laughing) Ah... Nothing in here. Me either. That's it. (Preston) That's all the magic books I have. I'm sorry, Levi. We haven't found a single spell that can help you. Uh, you know... maybe that's okay. I've been thinking. It's not the end of the world. I've been a kid before and I can do it again if I have to. And as for my voice, well... There's more to music than just singing. Oh, what's gotten into you? I was feeling really mixed up. And then I heard one of my songs. It made me realize that... no matter what changes on the outside, I'm still me on the inside. And I'm really happy to be me. Wait a second... What is it, Preston? You said you were feeling mixed up. Maybe you were mixed up, and so it's my magic. It got tangled with the spell Tynamon used. Ha-ha! (Levi) What is it? The Separation Spell. Will that work? I hope so. Are you ready? Delepseed epna, et tara pes. Seedaneek, otpo... seegam! I think it worked. It did work! My voice is back! And you're big again. (grunting and singing) (with Levi's voice) What's that horrible sound? Ha-ha! There you are, Megamauler. I've been looking all over. (voice changing) How dare you run away from me? Wait, my voice! Ha! They must have broken your spell, fool. Without Gold's voice, the Fusion Star won't work. We'll have to destroy the Rangers the hard way. Wait a second! What makes you think I'll help you? Why wouldn't you? I mean, you don't want folks to think you're scared of the Rangers, do you? How dare you? I'm not afraid of anything! That's not how it looks. Then I'll show them. I'll crush those rotten Rangers! Hm, that was easy. It's good to have you back, bro. (alarm blaring) Not my motherboard! I'm detecting monster activity on Third Avenue. We'd better go. Ooh, ah, Levi. Maybe you could test out the new Super Star mode for me. Sure thing, Mick. We'll monitor things from here. (screaming) Just in time, Rangers. So Preston's spell changed your voice back too. Well, it's a good thing you're all in one piece. Before we destroy you. It's Morphin' Time! Power Stars... (all) Lock in! Ready! Ninja Spin! (battle-cries) (Megamauler) Watch out, Rangers? I'm about to get the word "destruction" new meaning. Speaking of new, time to try my new Ninja Star. Super Star Mode activate! Ninja Spin! (all) Woah! Check it out! Levi's new mode is epic. Storm Star, lock in! Storm Star, tornado mode! Ninja Spin! Defeating you it's gonna be a breeze. A little wind doesn't scare me! It should. (grunting) Super Star Storm Slash! Final attack! Aah! What? No! (Calvin) That was amazing, bro! I'm just warming up. Here it goes! Lion Fire Red! Come on, let's help him out. Yeah! Let's go! Yeah! Yeah! (battle-cries) Heads up! (grunting) That one hurt! Yeah! All right! This will teach you not to steal people's voices. Lightning mode! Ninja Spin! (electricity crackling) Super Star, supercharged! Oh! Lightning Slash! Final attack! Aah! Oh, no! My brilliant plan is falling apart! Hey, looks like you dropped something. Our Fusion Star, nice. I'll get you for this! Well, he's gone. But we got the Star back. (Cosmo Royale) Tynamon is a loser! But shall we give Megamauler a second chance? (cheering) All right! Gigantify! I'm back, folks! You know how I roll. (grunting) Here comes Megamauler again. Better call our Zords. Blaze Zord Stars... (all) Lock in! (all) Activate! (all) Ninja Spin! Combine! Ninja Blaze Megazord, ready! Ninja Super Steel mode, ready! I'll flatten you all! Not so fast, buddy! Ugh! (grunting) He's too strong, we gotta try another approach. Any ideas? Block his roller! No, I'm stuck! (Sarah) It worked! Wait a second. The monster surprised us by combining skullgators. Maybe we can combine something surprising too. Like the Blaze Megazord and the Ultrazord. Great idea. (all) Zord Stars, activate! Ninja Spin! All right, team, let's hope this works. Ninja Ultra Star, lock in. Ninja Blaze Ultrazord, combine! Ninja Spin! (Brody) Ninja Blaze Ultrazord, ready! All-new combination! This is amazing. Great idea, Brody. Let's try it out. (grunting) I'm rolling again! He broke through the block but we're ready for him. (grunting) (grunting and laughing) Blaze Ultra Strike! (grunting) (screeching) (cheering) This thing is so fast! (Megamauler) Back off, Rangers! (grunting) Blaze Ultrablitz! (grunting) And again! Ooh! Ah! All right, yeah! Let's finish this guy. Levi, take this. Thanks, bro. Going up. Ha! All right, Megamauler, we're gonna make this quick. Begin final attack! Ninja Spin! (grunting) Ninja Super Steel Blaster! Energize! (all) Ninja Blaze! Fire Zord! This isn't good! (screaming) (cheering) We got him! Show's over. Ninjas win. So, Levi, how does it feel to be back to normal? You know what? The only difference is that I look like this guy's big brother again. (laughing) Hey, wait, this is her. Hey, your name is Rosie, right? Oh, my gosh, Levi Weston? Nice to meet you. I hear you're a fan. You gave some good advice to, uh... ...a friend of mine. He's a kid with sort of a funny voice. You mean Aiden? Really? You're friends? Yeah. We're uh... We're very close. So... I was wondering. You wanna play ball with us? Yeah, that'd be great! Okay. Ooh, wow! Nice. Come on, Preston. Wow. That's Levi Weston. Excuse me, Mr. Weston. Can we play with you? What do you think, Rosie? Can these kids play with us? Mm... I guess so. That a girl. Come on! (all) Wow! Nice kick! (chuckling) These suits are golden, Monty. With them on, we'll always be clean and safe. Ah! My mask! Ah! Ah! (Vic) Oh, no! (Vic) They're in my mouth! (Monty) It's in my mouth too! We're doomed! Oh, no! ♪♪
