 - Either you're lying to me or you don't remember 'cause you've said it. - About the vow renewal, Shannon's supposed to be there with John and all six of their kids, and I want that. - You're wasted all the time! Goodbye! - I'm 30 days sober today, bitch. I'm sorry. - I would like to just start over. - I would love that. - Don't judge me by what I do. In fact, just don't judge me at all. - Cheers to bad choices... then making better ones. - Those who live in small houses

 should definitely throw stones. - Life is full of beautiful curves... New hip! And so am I. - I earned my money the old fashion way... Marrying it then making more. - I've closed the old Beador and opened a new one. - Thank you for my flowers and my necklace. It's beautiful. - You like 'em? More where that came from. - Oh, good. Keep it coming. - Yeah. - Are you excited to move? - I am. - But right now, something is keeping you in New York. - His job. - Yeah. - I know when Rick is delivering the news, when he's looking at that camera, he's really looking at me. - I want to do stuff for you. - I want to build things for you and arrange things... hang stuff for you on the walls. - I want to make you happy and comfortable and take care of you. - Rick has taught me what real love is about. - Somebody who's committed, somebody who has your back - Is a ride or die. - I love you. - I love you more. - My baby. - It's not only up here that I like about Rick... - It's about down there. - I'm lucky to have you. - Damn straight. - I know it. - President Trump addressed the nation on the effort against the coronavirus and insisted an outbreak in the US is not inevitable. But this morning, there is a new case in California that's raising concerns. - Is she gonna make us walk up this hill? - Oh, I walk up this hill, like, five times... - Oh, my God. - Every time I work out. - I don't wanna do this at all. - It's brutal. - Good morning. - Hello! - This is Gina, my friend. This is Paulina. - I'm just, like, really... I was... used to be really fit. - Exhale going up. Good job. - And I'm just, like, really out of shape so... yeah. - You've come to the right place. - Being in this healthy relationship, I feel more comfortable in my own skin. And I'm just kind of like more like you, you know? I don't care. I'm gonna eat that... ing cookie. - First thing I'm gonna have you do is we're gonna start with the warmup. Arms up, elbows by your ears. That's to make it burn more. - It's already burning. My ass is on fire. - That's what I like to hear. - Me ass is in fuego! I already feel like I popped a glute. - 14, 13, perfect. - 98, 99... I'm dying and I haven't even reached the hard part yet. - What's the hard part? - My body doesn't understand though. - Abs of steel. Go, go. Three, two... - And one, you guys. - Whoo! - It really has. - It changed everybody's life. - Go get some water. Rest, ladies. - Let's sit down and take a water break. - Thank God I have this jacket on. It's squishing all my fat rolls. So you had a birthday dinner for Sienna, right? - So last night, we had a birthday dinner. - How'd that go? - I'm just like really proud of my family right now. - Hi. - What? Hi. How are you? - Hi. - Hi. How are you? - Good. - Good to see ya. - So his trial's coming up for the DV. Or is it a closed meeting? Is it closed? - I don't know. These are questions that I'm glad you're my friend 'cause I'll ask them. - Okay. - I just wanted him to accept responsibility for it. I don't wanna impact his life forever if he's working on himself, he's going to anger management, he's doing well. - On one hand, I understand that Gina probably doesn't want him to have a felony on his record. But on the other hand, I think Matt is a classic narcissist who uses guilt to make Gina feel badly about everything she does. Are you testifying? - It's such a weird position to be in because it's like, what happened there... - You're saying you're afraid to do it 'cause you don't want to upset him. - I don't wanna mess with what's going on now. - Or make him mad and upset. - Yeah. - You know what though? I feel like you should do it. Because that's your chance to say how it affected you. - Will you go with me? - Of course I will. Absolutely. Uh, is our water break over? Your water break is over. - Lay on your backs. It's time for abs. - Oh, okay. - Chin up towards the sky. - Oh, my God. Those hurt so bad. - I'm like good 'cause I've been putting in some work in the bedroom. - Okay, Kelly. - Just give me a second. I'm like the worst... I am so bad at parking. - There's my bougie bitch. - You can't be bougie in a minivan. - How are you? Give me a hug. - Hey, babe. - Good to see you. - You too. - Garage will shut automatically. Bye, honey! Oh, he's gonna miss me. - I'll get on your right. - Thank you for doing this with me today. I appreciate being asked out in public. - So yeah. The party was a little bit different, you know? - Honestly, I probably shouldn't have even gone to that party. I was already in just such a not good headspace. I wasn't ready to say the words "I'm an alcoholic... - Right. - 'Cause you say those words, you can't come back. - Just so you know, Braunwyn, my dad was an alcoholic as well. - I know you've dealt with your sister too. - Correct. Seeing Braunwyn at that party go crazy reminded me of my sister. She's a 40-year-old drug addict. Everyone's like, "Oh, Elizabeth. "You have all this money. Why don't you help your sister?" Let's go right here. - Yeah. - I can't help my sister, but I can help Braunwyn. Even if it's in the littlest way. And I'm gonna try. You know, they kept wanting to party the rest of the night. And I cheers'd after you left with them and I should've have. Here's to putting drama aside and enjoying ourselves. - Cheers! - That was really wrong of me. I wanna own up to that and I apologize. - I am realizing very quickly who my friends are and who are people that aren't. And I thought Shannon and I were friends, and now I know we're not. We have two very different stories of what happened. - I only have what I heard. And... - But you didn't hear it correctly, Braunwyn, because I didn't say it. - I've never held my ground against any of these women ever. And now I'm just... I can't. Walking into Shannon's party, there was a lot of tequila there. - Are you tequila... - Oh. - Are you a tequila drinker at all? Or no. But we have everything. - Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. A good friend would have called you and given you a heads up. I honestly think her doing that was a big eff you, Braunwyn. Oh, you know what? You're gonna call me a liar? Well, look what I'm gonna do for you. Try to stay sober now. I had been putting myself first for the first time in a long time. - Doesn't it feel good? - It doesn't all the time. - Oh. - Sometimes it feels really... ing bad. Right. - Hm, self-reflection. - No, for real. - No, no. - For real. - But I mean that... - It's like a mirror to your face. - When my ex... When I was with him, all it was was yes people. So I need some people to give me the reality of the bullsh... - And you know what? And you do have a lot of yes people in your life, so you want real people. - And then like, all my girlfriends, I took them on trips. Flew them on a private jet to Nantucket. Got 'em on my yacht. They were naked, and they were having fun, and we drink champagne, and we'd go through the Panama Canal. I mean, I paid for all of it. And the minute I didn't have all of that... - They were gone. - They were... ing gone. - Yeah, they weren't your friends. - I was shocked. - I'm here. Like, that's what I do. I do real. - I learned pretty early on that most of your friends are fake when you get a lot of money. But I don't look at money as if that should define me. Because for years, that's how I did look at it with my ex-husband. Has your mom been in this at all with you or no? - She's known I struggled with drinking. But we literally haven't talked. It's been a while since I've seen my mom because I don't feel like I can trust her. She found my weak spot that would hurt me the most and boom. I cannot believe my mom called Tamra and told her that I quit drinking. I physically felt like I was punched so hard, I couldn't breathe. And it was just right back in my face. "I can't trust you." - What kind of mother does that? - Mine. - Oh, my God. That is really... I'm sorry, but I'm a mother. - But I guess... - I love our mothers, but that is really inappropriate. Is she coming to your vow renewal? - Yeah. My mom will be there. My stepdad, my brother, my sister, my grandma, my grandpa. I'm going up the day before. We're gonna go to my mom's house. So we did this for our ten-year anniversary. And so on our ten year, we said let's do it every ten years. - Okay. I have a feeling it's gonna be a good moment for you. - I haven't... - Almost a new beginning. - Like, I just want a nice, pleasant day. Is that too much to ask really? - Coming up... - Amazon is sold out of hand sanitizer and wipes. - Because you bought it all. - You look pretty. - Parents' night out. Aww, thank you. You're so nice. - I can be nice. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. We're here. We're meeting friends. - Okay, perfect. - Yeah. - For Elizabeth? - Elizabeth, yeah. - Right this way. - Thank you. Hi! - Oh, hi, Gina. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? Good to see ya. - How are you? Good to see you. - Hi! - Hi! Oh, your hair. - Hi! - Hello! What's up? - Good to see ya. - Good to see you. - It just feels nice to be able to bring somebody to a double... triple... Whatever date. - Why don't the three of us go out to dinner but bring the guys? - I would love that. I have a date. And that feels good. - Did you order cocktails? - Get this woman a cocktail! - Get her a shot. - Get her a shot! - Can I have a Casamigos Anejo soda with a little lime juice? - I want the same thing but a splash of grapefruit. - Yeah. - Just a Ketel dirty martini. - Hummus? - I love hummus. - Can we get a hummus? - And the hummus? - Yes. - You got it. - And a poke. - You got it. - Wait. Do you know what I did today? - What happened? - What? - I stockpiled. - What does that mean? - For coronavirus. I'm so tired, wanted to go home and take a nap. But we had to go, like... clean out Trader Joe's. - Trader Joe's. I have four freezer drawers, and now two of them are full with all frozen meats. - Oh, God. - And then I thought, "What if the electricity goes out?" I gotta get the canned meat. I got canned chicken, canned beans. - We got all the colors of canned beans. - I got a bunch of canned goods. - We got so much water. - Why? - Shannon really reminds me of that type of person that has a secret bomb shelter. I am actually surprised that she hasn't had a secret underground bunker this whole time. - You guys buy a generator? - No. We didn't go that far. - Not yet. - Amazon is sold out of hand sanitizer and wipes. - Because you bought it all. - No, I didn't buy any! - Cheers, you guys. - Okay, cheers. - Hey, nice to hang out. - Cheers. Good to be with you. - To new friends, old friends. - To new friends! - And to no coronavirus. - Whoo! - No coronavirus. - No corona. No virus. No nothing. - So Gina went to an AA meeting with Braunwyn. - I did. - What happened? We all got quiet, like... I... I... I... - That just changed the mood. - I feel... I knew. I know and I'm sorry. I feel really bad for her. Like, my whole perspective of her has been completely changed. - Did she share? - She did share. And she shared a lot about her personal anger and, you know, she was not proud of the fact that she had misappropriated her anger, and that, like, it was easier for her to be angry at someone else than to accept and be angry at herself for, like, having this disease essentially. And she was clearly taking it out on me and Shannon. And... - Yeah. - She admits that. She was really vulnerable. I'm telling you. Like, and that's scary. - Acceptance is very difficult. - Vulnerable in front of me? - Yeah. - I'm ready to rip her head off. - That's big. - It was big. - I had a little moment with her. We rode bikes. She did open up as far as being sober. So I'm glad that, you know, she had that breakthrough with you where... - Yeah, I think it's just like, how can you be angry at somebody who straight up, like, acknowledges that she was totally... - Braunwyn didn't straight up acknowledge anything to me in my phone call. - She didn't? - Nope. - And she's adamant about her position on the words that I know I didn't say. So I feel as though I've been a good friend to her, so it's just hurtful to me. But I'll get over it. - No. Don't just get over it. But give her a little time. - I know. I... I'll get over it. - Sean is very supportive of her, which is awesome. But he also has to be supportive as far as not being enabling. - I know. - Did you see the party when she went up, "Sean, she said this!" And I was like... - Did I see the party? He yelled in my face. - Gina, that was rude and inappropriate. - Sean. - Thank you. - No. No, no, no. - You can have a discussion before you yell. - He's put in terrible, compromising positions 'cause he's supporting her. And she's doing it to him! - But he's not supporting her. He's enabling her. - No, he's enabling her. That's what I'm saying. We can't be mad at him because he's like trying his hardest. - He doesn't know what he's doing. He has seven... ing kids. It's gonna take them a lot as a family to come together and fix that. And, like, I'm not going to make that worse. Screw that. - Completely big of you, by the way. - It's good to hear that Braunwyn, who was gunning for Gina, stopped. But if being sober means that you concoct stories in your head, like, things aren't getting better on the Shannon Storms Beador side. Are you guys both going to the desert? Yes. - I'm gonna go to the vow renewal. - So you are gonna go! Good. - I'm gonna go. Yeah. - Are you gonna go? - No, I'm not gonna be there. - Why? - He has his kids. - I have my kids. - I won't go if Travis doesn't go. - Wait, you're going. - No, I'm not if Travis isn't. - You're going. - I have a partner meeting so I'm gonna drive separately. - Get with him. - I'm gonna drive separate. - She said her trigger is tequila, so she's not gonna have tequila there. - Oh, really? Okay. But we're all going and we're all making the effort and I think it's important for her sobriety that we all are there for her... - Yeah, to support her. - So I think it'll be good. I mean, we may have a little sippy cup with some alcohol, but... I am going to be drinking at the vow renewal. If I'm on vacation and away from home, I wanna enjoy myself. Am I gonna do it right in front of her? No. - Would you guys like another round of drinks? - Yeah. Oh, why am I only having the next round? What's going on with you? But I think that Gina and Elizabeth may be taking it too far. Get going, get going, get going. - Okay, okay. - Get going! - You are the worst one. - Are you gonna be Braunwyn's sponsor, 'cause... I'm sorry. - Coming up... - Now that I'm not drinking, no one wants to hang out with me. - You're not nearly as fun. - What's going on? - The new desks, all the new furniture for the new front office is gonna come over here. What else do you want in here? - A TV. - TV? Okay. - 'Cause Rick's always like, "Watch me. I'm on." Since investing a $1/4 million into Positive Beverage, it has grown from the little startup company to now getting into Target. So to all my haters that didn't think I could be a success... - Kelly, you are not a businesswoman! - I am! - Nobody is going to you for business advice! - Look at me now. Whoo! Wait. Tell me about Expo West and how what? We just lost $100,000. - Yeah, our whole booth is loaded in. It's completely built. We're all ready. And then literally last night, they made the call that they're not doing it. - 'Cause it's coronavirus? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. - Yeah. - So are we gonna get our money back? Are we gonna get... - No, of course not. - Last year, we got a lot of business doing Expo West. - Give me your pitch! - It's vegan. It's non-dairy. And it gives you calcium boost. That's what sets us apart. - Yes! Good. What's the glasses for? - Future's so bright, we have to wear shades. We spent a lot of money on our space, refrigerators, and it's just poof, gone. Shannon Beador, she's gonna do some kind of water. And I'm like, "Oh, God." - Are you seri... - What a joke. You don't even know what it entails. - It's so much more work than anybody could possibly comprehend. - Good luck. I'm not quite sure what Shannon's water line is. All I know is that she was telling me she was doing some kind of beverage. - It's like, based off the lemon cleanse. It's called Lemon-Aid. It has lemon, cayenne. - Anti-inflammatories? - Yeah. So it's coming soon. - I have a drink. Now she's got a drink. She can compete with me all she wants. There's no competition. - Dude, this is so good. - Isn't it? - It does like lemonade. - But it's prickly pear. So it's got a little bit of like that kick to it. - What's prickly pear? - It's a fruit. - It is? - Yeah. - I know that a pear is a fruit but what makes it prickly? - Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. That's what it is. - Those purple red things that grows on the cactuses? - Yeah. - That's a prickly pear. - Oh. That's funny. - There you go. - Whoa! Hey. - - My goddess. - Hi. - Hi, baby. Oh... - Hello. - Hey, you. - Hey. - Big Marley. - The things with my mom are old and they're deep. But whatever issues I have with my mother, they're between me and her. And that's my kids' grandmother. I don't want tomorrow to be weird. We need to get this first interaction out of the way. - You guys wanna see the garden? - Yeah, I really do. - Yeah, I do. Sure. - I have only been here once for like two minutes to pick the boys up. - I'ma take you up to the Zen deck. - Oh, yeah. - We're still working on it, you know? It's a work in progress... - Yeah. - Like all of us. - My mom, Brian, and Marley and Mikayla, they bought that piece of property up in the hills with the beautiful views a decade ago. Brian graduated from doing his years of residency. He got an amazing job, and they've been building their dream home. Is that where you put the papers where you let go of stuff? - Yes, yes. - Like... yes, okay. - It's a good thing to do. Letting go. - This is a beautiful home. But this isn't my home. This isn't where I grew up. This isn't my place. The Ritz Carlton is right down the street, and they always have availability. - Those are called the Shadow Mountains. - It's beautiful. - You look clear. - Thanks... what? - Can I touch your hair? - Yeah. - Thanks. - I know. That's funny. - Some of it. - I pay for really good hair. - Look at him. - He brought out a serving tray. Thanks, Marley. - Thank you. - Thanks, Marley. - How's Kelly? - Good. - And Shannon lives close to you. - Shannon, I could throw a ball and hit her house. - Which we're not talking really right now, so that's super uncomfortable. - But, uh, Gina's coming. - Mm-hmm. You know, I've met her but I don't know. She just always... I don't know... She's not interested in me. - Mm-hmm. - I think now that I'm not drinking, just no one wants to hang out with me except for Gina. I mean it sucks. It sucks. - But you're not nearly as fun. I'm saying that's what they maybe were thinking. - Yeah. Mm. I don't think my mom could say a worse thing to me. I mean, I've been called Boring-Wyn for an entire year now. - She has a nickname for you. - Waters. - Boring-Wyn. - Maybe Braunwyn is boring. Boring wine. - I don't drink wine. I don't even drink wine. - You whine like... - Ugh. - Put that... put that coat on. - It's okay. I'm good in this. - Are you sure? 'Cause it's super cute and super warm. - My mom has been using my addiction as a weapon for so long. "Look at Braunwyn. "She doesn't know what she's talking about. "She's drunk. Look at Braunwyn. She is broken." - You guys are so cute. 20 years ago. Oh, God. - We love that. - He was really cute. - If she were to look at me right now and say, "You know what? I'm really proud of what you're doing," that would just... I'm gonna go eat now. - That's a good call. - Here's to good choices. - Here's to good choices. - Oh. Did you change the sign... - No. - In your downstairs room? - We kept it down 'cause no. 'Cause that room is for bad choices. - Coming up... - Braunwyn's not having tequila at this party. - I'm a diabetic. I'm not gonna have any freaking cake at my party. Can we just go to the liquor store? I'll have it in a flask. - Hey. - Hey. - How are you? Come on, Archie. - Oh, my God, this rain. - Did Rick go to New York? - Yep. - Is he freaking out about the corona thing? - No. - No? - But everybody else is. - I know. I'm starting to a little bit. Like, I'm not gonna freaking be a statistic for corona... ing virus. Ugh. - Hi, hi. - Hi! - What's going on? - What about the weather? - Not much. - What about the weather? - It sucks. - Yeah. - Hi. - Oops. - It's raining. - Is she getting married outside? Not anymore. I don't know. - I mean, was she? - I don't know really. - They already said "I do." So what do you say, "I did?" - I think every time you have a threesome, you have to renew your vows. - Oh, my God. - You had a threesome? - Yeah, all the time with me. - Yeah, with Kelly. - I'm just kidding. - Yeah. Kelly punched me in the face. That was a threesome. - I said, "Stay there!" - Then went out. - "Stay down!" - Hi, Archie. - Hola. - Hi. - Okay, ladies. Let's rock and roll. Bye-bye, Archie. You be a good boy! Ooh! Then we got the fancy van. - I am gonna get super car sick. - I have to sit in the front. I throw up. - Yeah. She throws up. - As much as I enjoy being in the company of all these ladies, what happened? Why am I the only guy? - You're the lucky one. - You're the lucky one. - I am lucky. - Where's John Janssen? - He's driving with the kids. - That makes sense. - You're trapped now. - Are we almost there yet? - Hi. - Hi. - It's his first time here. - Yeah. I haven't been here before. - I've made many a bad choice here with my girlfriends. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Thank you so much. Enjoy your stay. - Take care. Thank you. - She says the car's not there yet. I'm gonna call them, Braunwyn. We need our kids. - Do you have to have fake boobs to go in there? - Well, I don't know. - Yeah. - She's funny today. - Oh my gosh this is beautiful! - Oh, wow. - Happy anniversary. - Mm. - Whoo! - I want a cocktail. - Oh, wait. I asked for some. - Let's cheers to Braunwyn's 20th anniversary. I think the only one that's been closest to that is you. You beat us to the marriage. - I was 17. - Oh, was that what it was? - Yeah, 17. - Yeah. - Oh, wait. Shannon, have you met David's fiancé? - No, never. - Still no? - I don't know. He just likes to keep things quiet. - Sneaky. - He doesn't wanna talk to me. He doesn't want me to meet her. I just wish David would return some of my texts. All I wanna do is be a good co-parent. Now it's so awkward, you know? Because it's like, I can't keep going, "Hi! How are you?" I just don't get it. If someone's living with your kids 50% of the time, and you haven't met them, that's just weird. I wouldn't be mean. All I care about is that David's fiancée is kind to my kids. - Doesn't he have Instagram? - I don't look. - You don't look? - Nope. - I know, 'cause she still has me blocked on Instagram so... - Emily checks nightly. - Oh, my God. - When is the last time I even posted? - I wouldn't know, Shannon. Can you unblock me so I can have a party? - All right. Let's make it official. - I'm gonna comment all over everything now on your feed. - I pushed unblock. - Whoo! It only took three years, a new hip, five shots. There should be like, confetti coming down. Look at this. This is amazing. - Knock knock. - Hi! We're here. - Come in. Mwah. - I brought food. Sorry. - Oh, no. - Our room's not ready yet. So we're gonna eat in her room. - Perfect. Shari is my best friend. - Yes, boo. This is way bigger than ours. That's why we're trying to get a new room. About a month before I got sober, I had asked for help. She was the one making those calls while my husband would say, "No, Braunwyn's fine." She knew I was an alcoholic. She was like my guardian angel. I was with my family last night. I went to my mom's house. - Are they all coming? - Everyone but my grandfather because he's quarantined himself. - Oh, that's right. - Oh. - Because he's an urgent care doctor, and he's like, "I just can't be around people and get coronavirus." Like, it's gonna... At this point, I'm just doing the "Serenity Prayer"... Accept the things I can't control. The weather, the virus. - And no booze. You're just like, rolling with it. - Oops. Dang it. I just sent my ex-husband a heart emoji. You did? - How do you do that by accident? - Do you like double tap? That way? - How does that happen? - Ha ha. - You can undo that. - I had a nine-hour deposition yesterday. I'm gonna try and be good for Braunwyn but I kinda feel like having a drink. After my deposition. - I really just think Elizabeth lives on another planet. She can't talk about the divorce but only talks about the divorce. - It is what it is. - It's not a wedding. - We have been married for 20 years. I actually vividly remember standing up there with Sean and thinking how easy marriage was gonna be. - Well, I feel like that's what everyone thinks. - So Braunwyn's not having tequila here at this party. - You lie. - I swear to God. - So Shannon, you know there's no tequila at this party. Just warning you. So don't order a margarita. - Why? - That's her trigger. - Okay. I'm a diabetic. I'm not gonna have any freaking cake at my party. - Look at Kelly to just... - Why should you punish everybody because you're the alcoholic? - I'm sure in your room, the minibar has tequila. - Can we just go to the liquor store? I'll have it incognito. I'll have it in a flask. I am not a quitter. - There's a liquor store here. - They'll have it. - Yeah, let's do that. They'll have it. - Yeah. - She's like, as sensitive as a porcupine, that Kelly Dodd. She just... she just don't got it in her. - Okay. Let's go get this tequila. - No. We can't go empty-handed. - All right. Take your time, ladies. - Coming up... - Elizabeth was just telling me that she wanted to do artificial insemination... - Yeah. - To, like, have a kid. - But then what's she gonna do with Jimmy? - Right! - I'm gonna ask her. - Momma! - Momma. - Hello. - Hi. I was just coming here to meet the girls too. Oh, no. Don't touch my hair. - You look great. - Thank you. I have a team of people making this happen. - Well, it looks good. - Tonight is so important to me. I have friends flying in from the other side of the country. But I need to show myself that I can have fun, and I can be okay without drinking. - This is Julie's favorite place. - She likes it here? - Yeah, always stay here. - They have Hermès soaps in here. - Oh. - Just to let you know. - Okay, I'm like, clinking. Thank you. - Hi! - Say hi. Mwah. - How are you? - I'm so good. - Hi, you. - Hey! - Hey, how are you? You look pretty. - Thank you. I've been getting ready for last couple hours. And your boys are here. - I know. I see that. - I'm not very excited to see Braunwyn. - I missed you. So much. - My last encounter with Braunwyn didn't end so well. But I am respecting Braunwyn's sobriety by asking the bellman to take my bottle of tequila to the room. - Hi! - Hey! - How are you? You look so cute. I have some tequila here that I'm not supposed to show you. I didn't know that was a trigger. Sorry. - That's okay. - I'm not Kelly Dodd walking in saying, "Nobody likes a quitter." - All right, you guys should go, like, relax, eat dinner, take a break. - Okay. - All right. - 'Cause I really have missed you. - I was like, looking. I was like, "Oh, maybe there's like a meeting in the morning." But I know you have all the babies and it's crazy... There is, at 7:00. - I'll go with you if you're gonna go. - Okay. I'm gonna go. - Okay. Then I'll go. - This is Villa Bin. After you. - Nice. - Wow! - Wow. It's beautiful. - Gorgeous. - Super nice. - "Welcome to The Parker. Enjoy your stay." - "Notice persons have currently active diarrhea" should not be allowed to enter. - And who's monitoring this? - I mean... yeah. How do you let them know? That you're leaking out as you swim? It's your mommy. Hey, little rat. I miss you, baby. You look like Joe Dirt. What's up, El Dirte? You look pretty. How's school? - Mom, I have to go soon. 'Cause I have to study for finals. 'Cause I have finals this week. - All right. - Mm-kay. - I'm glad that your nose hairs aren't hanging out. - Mm-kay. Goodbye. - I got off the bus, and I saw Braunwyn. And she's like, "I missed you." And I was like, "Aww." 'Cause I kind of felt the same way. Like, we've come a long way. - It's not about you, Braunwyn! It's not about you! - I know. - That's great. - Silver companion. - Cheers, babe. To our little stay-cation. Wait. How do you do this? - I don't know. Give me a kiss. - You always ruin that. - What? - You don't know how to drink. - Let's just try it. - No. Let's try it. - No? - That's now how you do it. Let's do that one over again. - I can't open this. Can you call the room service? Ooh. So all the arthritis... - But you're so... - You're faking the arthritis. - No, I'm not. I just used, like, super-duper... - Do that one and do that one. - Oh, my God. I'm gonna punch you in your head. - Hello. - Let yourself in. - Don't worry. I brought my own meal. - What does she have? - Yeah, what'd you order? Ice cream? - I got a French onion soup and a salad. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - I appreciate it. You too. - Thank you. - Um... What did you think of the bus ride? - It got a little dark when you said there was gonna be no tequila at the party. - I know. Like, Kelly just made some insensitive comments. - Have you met Kelly? - I know! But it's like, my God. Like, this is a really big deal. - Well, the difference is you're making jokes about someone that has a real struggle or challenge. - Yeah. I'm actually surprised at Elizabeth. Is she drinking or isn't she drinking? She said she wasn't. - I don't know. Sometimes I can't figure out what she's saying. - I don't know. - Elizabeth and I went to the sauna the other day. - Mm-hmm. - And she was telling me that she wanted to get her eggs frozen 'cause she thought she might wanna have a child. - Right. - But, I mean, she's with Jimmy. And she introduces Jimmy as, like, her boyfriend. So then I'm like, "Well, does he wanna have kids too?" And she said, "No. I don't think so." - Do you have kids yet? No? - I don't. But I've never really had, like, a really strong desire to have children. - Okay, well, then he doesn't wanna have kids. - I mean, to each his own. - So then she was talking about, like, artificial insemination... - Yeah. - To, like, have a kid. - But then what's she gonna do with Jimmy? - Right. So is he a boyfriend, or is he just like? - There's a lot of weird stuff going on there. - Well, Kelly told me they don't have sex. - I know. It's so weird. You have to have sex to have a baby. You gotta do it to make the baby. I'm gonna ask her. - When it comes to sex, you're like, "I just ask right away." - I like to ask the question. - Wow. You look amazing. Look at Momma's wow. - People say that soulmates are not real. But I knew the minute Sean walked in the door that we were gonna be together forever. And here we are 20 years later, and I'm just now figuring out who I am. It's sort of like almost like we're giving birth to a whole new phase of our life, and I am excited. - Mommy's a wow. Mommy's a wow. - What time is it? - It's 6:00. - What time does it start? 6:00. - Okay. We're gonna be late. - Oh, my God, you guys. Whoa. Give me two minutes. The dress has to be lower than the jacket. Oh, my God. Call me the fat ass. Oh, my God. Is my neck too fat? - No! - No, you just gotta move your finger. - This is called fat back then. - Don't. Stop it. - Don't you wanna have a coat? - No, I'm good. - One more sip. - Mom, don't fall. - Okay. Where's the umbrella? - Pull your dress down, Sophie. - The Beador-Janssen crew are coming dressed for a funeral, Kelly! - Oh, my God. - Why do I feel like pieces of... ing trash? - You're actually not invited. - Get back in the bus. - Look at this. Voilà. - So it's gonna be blackberry vodka, lemonade, club soda, and a coat of sugar. - Oh! I love that. Love that. Some people think that having a vow renewal is a curse. - You may greet each other with a fresh kiss. - Amen. - Oh, Shannon, I love you. You are the rock of my life, and I can't wait to spend the next 50 years growing old with you. - So better hope for Braunwyn and Sean. - Wow. - Hey! - Oh, my God! Where were you? - How are you guys? - I just did Bohemian black tie. - I like that. Hey. How are you? You look sharp. - In the flesh. - You look great. - How are you? - Oh, mwah. We're doing the air kisses. - I know. - Oh, my God, there you are. - Hey, question. Shannon Beador looks like a mortician. - It's so frustrating to be apart from Rick. But I have Zach here with me, and he is like my second gay husband. They all look like they went to a funeral. Hey, Shannon. Tell Zach about your water that you wanna do. - What are you talking about? - Coming up... - Do you vow to always love Dad when he gets really famous and bounces off with a 12-year-old American model? - Shannon, tell Zach about your water that you wanna do. - What are you talking about? It wasn't a beverage. Mine isn't a beverage. - No, no, no, no. But it... - I thought you said you were doing amino water. - No, I'm doing a tincture like a health supplement. - Oh! - Not a water. No. Hi! How are you? - She told me water. I'm not lying. - The powder you came up with, I want some of that. - Oh, it's a tincture. - Right, yeah. - Okay. - A what? - A tincture. It's a supplement that has... - A tincture? - A tincture. - What the hell is a tincture? And why would you even say that? It sounds like sphincter. - I told Kelly about Lemon-Aid. And she went and told her partner I'm starting a water company like I'm trying to go after her. I'm not... are you... ing kidding me right now? I am an ethical person that has morals. So I would never infringe upon someone's product. For Kelly to assume that I would, that's hurtful. - It's a tincture! - How long have you been doing this for? - 36 years. - Wow. - Babette Schwartz is an amazing drag queen. Larger than life. She happened to mention that she was an ordained minister so who better for this stage in our life? We have a son that loves drag. We have me that's just coming into her own to say, "Hey, guys. Let's have a fabulous time!" - Where are we supposed to sit? - I'll sit on your lap. - I need everybody to take their seats please. - Here, I'll... here. - I'll just lay across the women. Oh. - Why would she do that? It's completely inaccurate. I'm doing a nutritional supplement. I am floored by that. I would never do that. She freaking plants that into everyone's head? Why would she do that? Are you... ing kidding me? Honest to... ing God. - Everyone that way. - Come on. - I am Babette Schwartz, and I am gonna be your officiant this evening. What I would like to do now is I would like to bring out the Braunwyn and Sean family! We have Bella, Curren. We have Rowan, Caden. We have Jacob, Koa. We have Hazel. - She's picking 'em up. - Here they come! I give to you.... Braunwyn and Sean. - You guys did so good! Yay! - We're gonna have fun tonight. I'm thinking some of you are a couple cocktails in? And the rest of us need to get caught up. - Although the officiant's makeup is completely on point, she is extremely tone deaf. - Do you have anything you wanna say to each other? - I just wanna say the last 20 years with you have been amazing. Through everything that I've been or have become, you have been right there with me. And also, I have a gift for you. Sean loves a good statement necklace. - Sean just can't have too many statement necklaces. I always think of "Survivor," like he won the Immunity Idol. He's not getting kicked off the Island today. He's safe for one more round. - Wow. - The fish hook is a sign of being a provider. You've been such an amazing provider. On our first date, I said I never wanna work. I wanna have five kids. Most men would run. And he didn't. And he's like, "Okay. That's cool." - Yeah. - And here we are, and he's taken such good care of all of us. - So thank you. Stop making fun of him now. - Whoo! - Thank you. A crazy 24 years. The ups and down, the hard times, everything, I would do it again. And I did get you something special too. - Aww. - Yes! - So this ring that I had made. - Beautiful. - So every one of these gem stones represents each one of our kids' gemstones. - Aww. - Of our entire family. And I hope it fits. - She's like, "Give it to me." - Thank you. - Thank you. - Okay. - Do the children want to include vows to your parents? - Dad, do you vow to always love Mom even when, uh, she... embezzles all of your money and runs away in an Apache attack helicopter at 12:00 am? - If I can find her, yes. - And Mom, do you vow to always love Dad even when he gets really famous one day and bounces off with a 12-year-old American model? - What is going on here? - It was going so well. - I know. They need to quit while they're ahead. - What I said wasn't funny. - Okay. You're cut off. - Okay. - No. - Do you wanna say anything, Bella? - Uh, sure. You guys always keep your love so alive, and I honestly just find it so inspiring. And I can only dream of having the love that you guys have. Aww. - Yeah. She's the good one. Yeah. - It is amazing to be able to stand here and commit to Sean fully present. And to know that I mean it and I am fully here for it. - Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you again Mr. and Ms. Braunwyn Burke! - I gotta go tell Gina something right now. - I know. - You need to what? - Hey, Gina. I don't know when I told Kelly, but you know I've been working on my food line? - Mm-hmm. - And I've always been working on a supplement for a year. Kelly goes, "So, did you tell Zach about the new water line?" Are you... ing kidding me? What the? - I don't know even know. I had just come in and I heard... - No, like... - Well, she said... - Get your... ing facts straight, Kelly. I would never do that to you. I'm doing a... ing tincture. - Those are two completely different things. - What's going on over here? - Talk to her about it. - I will. - What's going on? - Next time on "the Real Housewives of Orange County"... - Your dad and I drink tequila, and she didn't wanna have tequila here. So out of respect, I'm gonna have one in the room. - Her kids have lice. - Who has lice? - Braunwyn's kids all have lice. - I was touching them! - I know! - Do you and Jimmy have sex? - No. We don't have sex. - Is it you that doesn't wanna have sex or him that doesn't wanna have sex? - Both. Why am I so... ed up in the head? What the? - I promise you this will kill you. - Get in there! - Whoo! - Oh! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
