 Human Resources will process your application, and call you if they need you. - When will they call me? - When they need you. But here it says immediate openings. What do you want me to do? Next please. GLORIA HAIR SALON - Charito. - Are you ready? How are you? I'm ready. Do I look younger to you? You look pretty good. You'll find a job soon, you'll see. I don't know.

 Things would be different if you hadn't dumped me for that thing. Stop it. Please, you're like a broken record. What do I owe you? Charging you would make you my customer, and I want something else. - Stop it, stop it already. - Okay, okay. What do see in that woman? Answer me. May God repay you. "I LOVE YOU. ANA." You were in charge that afternoon, Dominga. Everything points at you. Why did you do it? Tell the truth. Don't make matters worse. I needed money. Sofia paid me, and I helped her break out. Who helped you, traitor? Who else was with you? Nobody. I acted on my own. How much did Sofia pay you? Where's the money? There's nothing left. I spent all of it on my mom's operation. I put all my trust in you, Dominga. I did it because I believed in your loyalty. I'm so sorry I put this... scumbag in charge, sir, but I'm at your entire disposition. Officer Moreno, take her away. You can count on me for anything. Get up. Wasn't that a little too easy? You didn't question La Negra? You need to trust me, Teresa. Why didn't you question the head of security? She let somebody escape. What are you waiting for? All in due time. She broke out, right after the family visit. She simply walked out the main entrance. Has the press said anything? The usual, just the police blotter. Is Victor Hernandez involved? He practically lives in Capadocia. Here's his file. Before becoming a detective, he commanded a special forces unit, but he was framed, and got sent to Ciudad Juarez, where they shot at his house with his wife and son inside. The house was empty when he went home. They left him. His wife and his son. He was left all alone. And security will be tighter from now on. Visitations are now limited. There will be headcounts 4 times a day. Gatherings of more than 5 inmates are prohibited. We had nothing to do with the breakout. These are temporary measures. I need your cooperation, Magos. How is Sofia? She died this morning in hospital. Officer Moreno. Go back to your cells immediately. Inside. Inside. Inside! Close number 12. Number 8. Seven. Four. Inside. To me this prison is a rehab center. Seems absurd in this country's penitentiary system, but it's the only utopia I have left. Ruth, honey, I'm working late. Some important things came up. Dad isn't back either, but I wasn't alone one second. The bodyguard won't let me. Can you tell them to leave? No honey. Please be patient. Patient? I have to go feed my new parents, the bodyguard and that girl. Say hi to my sister. Bye You have a reason to wish for a better world. My daughter is only 14. Her sister is in jail. They tried to kill her dad, and her mom is here dealing with you. New shift. New shift. Why did you say Sofia was dead? To protect her, so they won't try to finish her off at the clinic. Finish her off? It's a possibility. Silence. Silence. Has anybody else broken out? Of course not. They helped Sofia escape. Nobody gets out of here just like that. Is it true you cut off that guy's dick? It wasn't me. It was his wife. Whatever. He still can't use it. What are you in for? Videos. How do I get some smokes in here? How do I get some smokes in here? Lorena rules in this joint. Just 1 smoke costs 10 pesos. A girl's got to make a living, Tona. I don't belong here. I miss Nayeli. Where's my baby? Nayeli! This isn't cool but... Thanks. Bed time. Put out your cigarettes. Brush your teeth Yolanda, and go to bed. Go to bed Magos. Hey. Will they let us say a Mass for Sofia? Sure, I'm taking you all to the basilica tomorrow. Cut the crap out, and go to bed! Cut it out! Now! What's that matter with you? Cut it now! Cut it out now! You girls need to calm down! Cut it out I said you bitches! Cut it out! Now! Cut it out! - Lorena! - Cut it out I said! Quiet! Quiet! You're only making things worse. Things will get ugly if the girls don't get their drugs. This place is a hellhole. Make them shut up! Do something! Shut up already or else... Party's over, bitches! Now will you go to bed? Or should I sing you idiots another lullaby? Silence. Silence. Hi Carmen. I'm glad you're back. The kid has another bad fever. What do you mean by another? - He's had a fever all week. - Hi honey. I told you so. He needs to see a doctor. Let me see. Did he take anything? I gave him a pill for the fever. Should I stay with him all night? Yes. Yes Carmen, I have to be somewhere. I just came home to change. Can you? Of course. I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. He'll be alright. It's nothing serious. I hope so. Get some rest honey. Alright? Thanks Carmen. Carmen. Did Susana call? No. Alright. "More drug lords fall. Castello dies." "American woman murdered." "Capadocia inmate dies in breakout attempt." "Singer slain in Capadocia." "Dead drug lords". "Santiago Marin seriously wounded." I have something very bad... very serious to tell you. What is it Teresa? The stash we found in Capadocia, hidden in Cautiva brassieres, I have all of it. But... I thought it had been seized and destroyed. Why didn't you tell me? You were in the ICU, and then in rehab. When was I supposed to? Where is it? In Capadocia. Do you know what you've done? The danger you and... And Andrea, Ruth, and you are in. I thought it was all over, but after they attacked you, they killed Felipe, Brenda, and Joel. I think their deaths are connected. They're looking for the drugs, Teresa. But who's behind all this? In Capadocia, La Negra's always there. Fernandez del Real put her there, and he took over Exo when they killed Cristobal. Why didn't you give up the drugs, Teresa? A drug cartel was supplying the European market from Mexico's first private prison. A project you supported, Santiago. A prison run by me. It's a trap. A trap Andrea fell into. How did you expect me to defend our daughter, without knowing any of this? Who else knows? Lorena. Lorena who? Lorena Guerra, she killed Bambi. Mom. Mom. Juli. Just tell me you love me. I love you very much. Juli, Juli, come back. Lorena honey. Did you have a bad dream or what? Sir, your guests are here. What's up? Where are you? Who am I? Your man, you idiot. What? Didn't you say you were coming over? No. Where? What bar? What's it like? Are there any hunks? I don't know, I'm tired, but I'll see you there. Just tell me where you are, and I'll meet you there. Alright? Okay. Bye. Your time's up, Federico, and my stash is still missing. It's not out there either, so it's hidden somewhere. I don't where the hell it is! Somebody stole it. The thing is, nobody fucks with me. So I suggest we stay here together, until we find out who did it. Okay? Are you sure this poison works? Sure, try it on that thing you call a woman. How come she works nights? Is she a hooker or what? This is it bitch. That'll fix you. Who, me? I'm way past fixing. Stop it, Caito. You'd better leave. Before Tita gets here, and all hell breaks loose. She needs to know about us. Get out. You're starting to get on my nerves. If I were just that strong, I'd kill you, but I don't have the strength to catch you off-guard, and stick this knife in you ever so slowly, until you say you're sorry. I've said I'm sorry lots of times. It doesn't work like that. One more time. One more time. Just one more time. Just once, and you'll never dump me again. Get out. Here's my brother's number. If you want that job, just call him and it's yours. Good riddance, scumbag. I wish I had never met you. Thanks. - Someone's here to see you. - I'm not expecting anyone. Are you coming or not? She's so annoying. Visitor to see Lorena Guerra. Visitor to see Lorena Guerra. There she is. I came because I'm sick. What's wrong? I'm sad because of you. Visiting hours are over. Return to your cells. Visiting hours are over. Return to your cells. I made Lorena a carnation with some Cautiva fabric. You like it? Let me see. It's beautiful. But I told you she doesn't love you. And you're a princess. You can pick and choose who can have you, and who can't have you. Yeah right. I'd be good to you. I'd love to do something for you. Something important. No, Blanquita, nobody can do anything for me. Who's the gringo scumbag that turned you in? I swear I'll have his head squashed. Really? - You're staying in Mexico. - You son of a bitch! Yeah, rip his eyes, and his tongue out. His fingernails and his hair. Fuck him up real good, just like he fucked me up. Tell me his name. Okay, but I want him to end up like my husband Carlos. The bastard used to sweat like a pig. What's the bastard's name? I hate him as much as you do. I'll tell you. But... Yes? If you kiss me... real good. Who is he? THE WOMAN YOU ARE Miss. Who are you? - Hi. - Good morning Carito. - How are you? - Fine. - Come. - I'm in a hurry. - Just for a moment. - I'll be right back. Anita. What's this? It's just... "something different. Do you want me? I don't just want you. I adore you. I got a job. Oh honey! The Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death, amen. Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death, amen. Rosaries are for the dead, not for the living. He's going to kill me. He's aiming at me! What's going on here? - It's okay. It's okay. - Help me! Help me! - Calm down. - Please! What's the matter? She's hallucinating. I think she's high. Sandra. Tranquilizer. He wants to hurt me! Why do you say that? Who wants to hurt you? We're here with you. Call Andrea please. Call Andrea! Call Andrea! Will you calm down if I call Andrea? - Yes. - Okay, I'll get her for you. Please. Calm down, it's okay. We'll get Andrea for you, and you'll be just fine. Here, Sandra. They killed my grandma... on my wedding day. Don't worry. He killed her. That was long ago. You're okay. He killed her. He's a Gringo with the DEA stationed in Mexico. Tell the emerald dealer lady I did my part. You still need to deal with the Colombian. Don't worry. I'm working on it. Any news about my case? "Judge to rule on Blanca Alfaro's appeal." The judge has your appeal, and the other stuff, when you do your part. Visiting hours are over. Visiting hours are over. I should've done this a long time ago, Moreno. What's wrong ma'am? You're no longer Capadocia's head of security. What? But why? Here's your notice of termination, signed by the mayor with a copy to Mr. del Real. You're fired, so get your stuff, and get the hell our of here. What happened? I fired her, I'm controlling the situation, which you should've done when you got here. You should've told me. I'm not consulting any of my decisions with you. You made a huge mistake. Please come with me. It's ready sir. Take a look. It looks real, right? But somebody tampered with it. It's a perfect job. The color changes a little between frames. We're trying to prove it. But... The best way to investigate Moreno was with her here, letting her feel safe, and unthreatened. Why didn't you tell me? Because you don't trust me. You think I'm a scumbag. Alright. Very nice work. But my daughter, my family, and I aren't your pawns. I fired that woman because I had to. If you want to win this war, and you're on my side, you need to work with me, not behind my back. Come here, you bastard. Bastard. Move it you bastard. New shift. New shift. What are you doing? Negra. - I'm turning this in officially. - Are you okay? Open up. Open the fucking gate! Nice costume. Lorena. What's going on? The fucking bitch fired me. I'm not head of security anymore. Don't you dare tell her I gave you drugs, because I'll kill you, and your kids. Got it? They sacked La Negra. You'll be sorry. They sacked the head of security. Goodbye! - They fired her! - Goodbye and good riddance. Benjamin. Yes? We've got your husband. In 30 minutes be at the corner of Alhambra and Emperadores. Come alone, and watch it, don't do anything stupid. From the emerald dealer for Santamaria the Colombian. What? Let's take a ride, Negra. Benjamin. Benjamin. This is all I've got. Let him go, don't hurt him. It's all I've got. Well, well, well. I got something you really care about, right? She brought you a little present. Where did you get all this money? Selling my goods? The same goods you couldn't find? Who did you sell it to? And where? I don't have your stash. I didn't sell it. So where the fuck did you get all that money? I could kill your husband right now. You stole the stash. Did you sell it? No, that's not it, no. No! I was paid to kill Brenda Yamilet. Really? Who paid you? Politicians, to avenge the attack on Santiago Marin. Maybe he did it himself. Well, well. I see La Negra has her own contacts, right? I don't believe her. I know she sold it. That's why you didn't find it. I don't have your stash. It vanished. Maybe the person that has it is Capadocia's warden, Teresa Lagos. And the prisoner Lorena Guerra. I swear. I wasn't there 24/7. I don't know where it is! I swear! I swear! How is Monse? Recovering. She's asleep. Poor thing. She had a panic attack. I'm on the verge of having one. Mom; how much time will I do if I plead guilty? - That's not happening. - How much time, mom? Probably 40 years. You're getting out. Your dad and I will prove you're innocent. But I'm not innocent, mom. I did little things I thought were unimportant. Andrea, please don't give up now. Mom, I slept with your student. I didn't know he was your lover. I took the mask off while robbing the jewelry store, saying I hated you, but I don't hate you. I was just confused. Andrea, I was the one that was wrong, not you. I spend all my nights asking myself why I never told you the reason why your dad and I got divorced. Why I didn't tell you the whole truth. I know my arrogance got you in here. One thing led to the other. Am I never getting out of here? You are getting out. I don't know how or when, but you're getting out. You'll have everything you've ever wanted. You'll have a life out there. You have my word. I promise, honey. Don't you want to talk, Lorena? I don't have to. No you don't, but it's free, so why don't you use it? Okay, you don't have to talk, so here's what we have so far. I understand you're here for killing your husband's lover, your best friend. You want to hear my secrets? Tell me yours first. Why are you here? How many mistakes have you made? Don't leave the house, Negra. We'll be watching you. Wait for our orders. What about my money? Your money? You already lost it you fool. Please, Benjamin. Go inside. I don't know who you are. You're an animal. A scumbag. Don't say that. Drugs? Drugs, money! Murders! - I only love you! - I don't want to see you again. - You're the only man I love. - I don't want to see you again. No, you can't leave. You're all I've got. You can't leave me. Let go of me! Let go of me! You lying piece of shit! My life, my love. Let go of me! You killed a woman. Only God knows what else you've done. They almost killed me. Let go of me! I'll kill you if you leave. And then kill myself. I may be a scumbag, but I did it for you. I wanted us to leave together. Free, just you and me. Fuck you. What did you do to me? Who did you kill? - No. - Why did you come back? No. Fuck off, Bambi. I'm not Bambi, I'm... Valeria. My name is Valeria Molina. I already killed you once. I'm sending you back to hell. Dream. I'm in a cell at Capadocia. Lorena Guerra assaults me. She thinks I'm Bambi. Possible transference. The inmates' frenzy relates me to this woman. Aurelia Sosa, La Bambi. Aurelia Sosa, La Bambi. As soon as I saw her picture I myself felt... No. No. Possible transference. That's all. End of report. Benjamin. Benjamin. Benjamin, what...? DEA AGENT MURDERED What is this? Fuck! The shrink! No, girl, it can't be that. No! - Are you okay? - Yes. Here's a little something for you. What? "Robert Spacy was murdered..." against Ana Moreno de Nunez, alias La Negra, suspected of murdering her husband, Benjamin Nunez Quintana. Inmate Ana Moreno de Nunez walk the red line. Move it. Gate. Right there, Negra. You know the drill. Move it, Negra. We don't have all day. Okay. Lights on. Lights on. Sofia, your statement is very important. I know you can't talk. But I need to know who helped you escape. Don't be afraid. I'm sure that neither you or your husband shot at the police. If you give us a statement, then... You don't ever draw a line, do you? Joel?
