 You sure about that? Go away. Don't be ridiculous. I live here. You're dead. Go away, bitch. This is just how I wanted to see you. You're dead, dead, dead, dead. - Shut up. How are your kids? - You're dead! They say the inmates' kids suffer a lot out there. I wonder. You've already forgotten your three kids, you little dyke? I'm watching them. Aren't you going to work? Yes, yes, of course I am, baby.

 I'll get dressed and take you to school. It's too late. They won't let us in. Where's Carmen? She left, yesterday she told you she'd take her kid to the doctor. You're a big boy. I've lost a tooth. I left it for the tooth fairy. Let me see. Come here. Come here. Let's see. Okay, go wait for me with your brothers, okay? Mom, help me please! Mom, please don't leave! We need to finish the sweater, Andrea. [Mom] Mom please don't leave! Mom! Mom! Don't leave me Mom! Mom please! Mom! I need to finish the sweater Andrea. Ruth. The hotcakes are burning. Remind me to explain to you again the complex procedure of turning the stove off. You're washing the skillet. Are you taking me to school? No honey, I'm not well, sorry. Sigfrido's taking you. What about dad? I'll give him a call to see what he says. You talked all week. Exo's CEO, Alvaro Fernandez announced that ten more privately run prisons will soon be opened thanks to the success of the Capadocia experiment, as part of the federal government's effort to curb crime in the country. Good morning. Don't pick it up, Tomas, please. I just spilled it. You look great. You're doing great. Right. I'm doing a lot better. They don't need to feed me anymore. Now they just take me to the toilet. The party's chairman asked me when you would take that job he offered you. Being a burden has it's advantages, right? Your enemies make peace with you. Excuse me? Please go away. Yes sir. It's the hospital. They're discharging Santiago. So what? The investigation was closed a while ago. Who's going to remember him? Marin? Please. The nutcase that shot him is more famous than he is. Only that crazy bitch can link Exo to what happened. That's one more thing Cristobal didn't take care of. Why did he ever accept to be Exo's CEO? The bastard. Because you made me deputy chairman, and saved yourself, me and Exo, before it all went down the drain with that idiot Cristobal. "Where are the goods?" What's wrong? I have to run. Federico. I'm counting on you. Bitch. You thought you'd get away with it? Take that, bitch, and that. Take that, bitch. I came here to make you pay you fucking bitch! That's what I'm here for, bitch! Wipe your mouth girl. What? You're drooling over the Colombian. Like a cube of sugar with flies all over. Why haven't your parents gotten you out? If I were your dad I'd fly you out of the country. - Exactly. - He tried to but I refused. - What? - What? I didn't want to go. You know what? You look bored, all of you. I think you need a show! Stop it! We've had it with your dumb shows. I've got some new songs, new choreography and costumes. That's a sock. Shut up, I'm rehearsing my new show for when I get out. You're never getting out. You are never getting out! Why don't you kill her? I mean, she put your dad in a wheelchair. You'd have your revenge and we'd get rid of her. What? I didn't shoot that jerk. Shut up asshole. - You shut up. - I said shut up! Andrea, please. Sit down. Eat up girls. Don't let her provoke you, my child. That won't help you in here. Well? You're ready, Montse? I'm ready, and I'm also so excited. Sure you are. You look real pretty. You look like a beauty queen. Do you love him? Sure I do. Look at him. He's so cute, my Nuro. Isn't he a little too old for you, Montse? No he is not. Plus he's so good to me. So, have you done it already? Don't be so nosy. Help me change. Which song are you dancing? Let me show you. Excuse me. Let's see. I know. You do? I can't accept your resignation, Felipe. This is a really bad time. I need you here. I'm sorry Teresa, but I agreed to cover Burian temporarily, and I've stayed much longer than I thought. Give me some time to find a replacement. Alright, just make sure it's as soon as possible. I promise. So, Blanca? What's taking you so long? You think it's easy to fuck Lorena's girlfriend? That's not my problem. All I want is to find out who killed my brother. I need more time. You've got some nerve. You want time now? I've given you time, money, a lawyer, protection in here. I mean, what else do you want? Are you planning to screw me or what? I'm not stupid enough to mess with the likes of you. I don't see why not. You betrayed your country and your company to work with the enemy. What can a poor emerald trader like me expect? You got 15 years, right? Look, I can get that sentence reduced to 6 months, and get you two million dollars. If you keep your part of the deal. Don't worry. I'll get you that name. And I want the Colombian dead. Don't forget that. Go on, work out. I've told you a thousand times, I had nothing to do with the missing drugs. Look, sweetheart, those candies cost Exo's CEO his life, and a Supreme Court judge, and a drug lord to boot. So if they don't show up, what can you expect? I swear to God I have no idea what these damn broads did with your drugs. Then find out. Or else I'll tell the new boss you stole them. You son of a... You wouldn't dare. I wouldn't? The cash your... candies were sold for is already in the bank. That's better. I've had it with your little games. Let go. - Talk. - Let go. - Talk. - What? - Talk. - About what? Tell me you're dying to be with me. For me to have my way with you, right? No, don't you mess with Lorena. I want you. I want you so much. It can't be Bambi. It just can't be her. What's wrong? You're burning up. Put me in here again and I'm spilling the beans. Calm down, calm down. - Get me out of here. - Calm down. Right now. They should let me use this for my conjugal visits, Tona. Tona, she's not feeling well. Santita is having another fit. Get it out of there. Get it out of there. It's poison. It's evil. Get it out of there. Teresa has to get rid of it. There will be tears. And gnashing of teeth for everyone to see. What's going on? What's wrong? Teresa. Get rid of it. Get rid of what? The serpent's egg. Get rid of it. Get rid of it! - Take her to the doctor. - Get rid of it. - Calm down. - Gently please. It's evil. Get rid of it. Get rid of it. It's evil, evil, evil. It's evil. Get rid of it. Get back to work. Lorena has a fever. She says she saw Bambi. Several other inmates too. It's just mass hysteria, that's all it is. Like the Chinese school kids? Or there are ghosts in Capadocia. Yeah right. Montserrat Olmos, do you take Nuro Vega as your lawfully wedded husband? I do Father. Nuro Vega, do you take Miss Olmos as your lawfully wedded wife? I do Father. May I have the rings. In that case please repeat after me. I, Montserrat Olmos take you Nuro Vega as my lawfully wedded husband, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, until death do us part. Please repeat after me. I, Nuro Vega take you, Montserrat Olmos, as my lawfully wedded wife, to love and to honor, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, until death do us part. What God has joined together let no man put asunder. This must be the fifth time that priest is marrying him. I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. Nanny. Nanny. Congratulations. God bless you my son. Thanks Nanny. Take good care of her. I sure will. Congratulations my dear. Thank you, Mama Nati. Come and say hello. Nuro, Mamé Nati wants to say hello to you. How is the cutest poppy grower in town? Happy to see my little girl in her wedding gown. - I have a surprise for you. - What my son? I bought Zurdo's land and put it under Montse's name. Really, Nuro? Have I ever lied to you? Or cheated on you? So that land you cultivated for so many years is now Montse's property, which means it's yours. Thank you Nuro, thank you. Thanks, Nuro. Let me take care of something. - Yes? - Yes. Mama Nati! Emiliano, I thought you weren't coming. And miss my future partner's wedding? I can't be the partner of a guy whose goods got stolen. No, no, what do you mean? They stole it from Carlos, God bless his soul. I always knew you were better at this than Carlos. Prove it to me and then we'll talk. God bless his soul. He's sitting at my table. Take care of him. Make sure he's comfortable. There's the Gringo. Take him to city hall. We'll talk there. Here's your money. Just put it on the floor. I'm ready to transfer the rest of the 100 million. It's 125 now. You said 100. Well now it's 125. Take it or leave it. I need to make a call. Make it snappy. I have a wedding to attend. A hundred and ten. Deal. Tell them to take the stash to McAllen. They'll be taken across the border. To watch it here. You'll answer with your life. I know. Transfer the money, Gringo. Done. Okay, Gringo. See you. That damn Nuro. The serpent's egg? Pliny the Elder wrote about some serpents that came together, nested together, to form an ovoid. Thus the serpent's egg. I don't think our Santita has read Pliny. What do you think? I don't think so either, I think what she means is that the serpents egg is here in Capadocia. Report for shift two of sewing. Felipe. Did Brenda tell you something... during her therapy sessions about Santiago? Did Burian tell you about his therapy sessions with his patients? Well, no, it's just that I'm sick and tired of everybody turning their backs on Santiago. The Attorney General said he'd reopen the case, but up to now the official story is that Brenda acted alone. What options do I have? Forget it. As soon as Andrea is freed, get out of here. And let them get away with it? Where's the justice? There is no justice. Not in this life. So, I heard you lost it. Stop snorting that shit. I don't do that anymore. Did you switch the stuff in the brassieres, Lorena? Are you insane? You're the one in charge of that. Federico swears the drug's still here. That it wasn't stolen from the truck. That's not true. How does he know that? They tortured and killed everybody that had anything to do with it, Lorena. Help me out here. And I'll help you escape. I swear I will, by the only thing I love in the entire world. The place reeks of cigarette smoke. And my mom tells me to wait for her. So I wait for her. But I'm paralyzed with fear, I don't want time to go by, I don't want her to come out. I don't want her to. Why not? Because after her, I'm next. But she does come out. And she makes me go inside. And I can't even think because that man grabs me. He disgusts me. He leans near my ear and whispers, "Close your eyes, remember you'll be famous." Is that why you shot Santiago? No, I shot him because he's dangerous. He's a danger to the country! He's very dangerous. Who told you to say that, Brenda? You're going to know everything, aren't you? Will you? Yes, yes, if you tell me. Hi Negra. - What are you doing there? - The door was open. What do you want? The director needs a file urgently. I'm in the middle of a session. Please close the door. I don't care what the director wants. Why are you crying? You won't tell anybody what I just said, will you? Because if you do I won't get my TV show. No, no. I won't say a word to anyone. But you still haven't told me. Why did you shoot Santiago Marin? Are you in the same business as Nuro and his buddies? Is this one of those little computer gadgets? - That's right. - It's cute. Can I have it? Sure, let me have your address and I'll meet you at your place. Okay? Okay? Okay. Clear the dance floor. We're going in. Stop fooling around. I'll fire any security guard I catch drinking. Go tell the others to stay put. Montse, don't forget to toss me your bouquet. No, toss it my way. Please have a seat. The boss wants to dance. Everybody say, "Dance, dance." Dance, dance, dance. Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance. Let's dance. Alright. Dance, dance, dance. Dance, dance, dance, dance. - Which song do you want? - Our song of course. Get down, Montse! - Montse! - Mama Nati! Montse. Montse! Get down! Get down! Mama Nati - Montse, I said come here! - Mama Nati! Montse, come here! Fuck this! Let's get out of here. My child. Baby. My baby. Darling. Calm down, calm down. Federal police. You're under arrest. Hi. I missed you. Me too. I got you these. Ruth, let's get the bags. Welcome home. No, let me do it. I need the exercise. I need to practice with this. This is much too big. Don't you think it's too big for us? I guess so, but it's part of the aid the government granted us because of the attack. How is Andrea doing? So so. She'll be out of jail in a few months. And how are you doing? I'm fine. Just fine. Capadocia has turned into just another prison. They use the inmates. They violate their rights. The Utopia is corrupt. They're opening ten more prisons. You're such a pessimist, my love. They're only building ten more because you were so successful. Do you know how long it's been since you called me "my love"? Since the day we promised not to call each other sweetie pie. Darling. Honeybunch. Lamb chop. And above all, never ever, under any circumstances, "my love." You know what scares me? Being a burden. But you aren't, and you never will be. You being here will do us a lot of good. Okay lamb chop? "and I hereby order "Montserrat Olmos Valverde to remain under custody "for the crimes of illicit gain, "conspiracy to commit a crime, and violation of the health code." "Montserrat Oimos Vaiverde, illicit gain, conspiracy to commit a crime and drug trafficking." Walk down the red line. Move it! That way. Get in there. Over there. Fill out that form. They'll search you now. Move it. That way. Quick, quick. Take your clothes off. Didn't you hear me? Take your clothes off, asshole. Don't you dare lay a finger on her. Get scarce. No, no, don't be afraid. I'll protect you. Now please change into those clothes. What's the matter? I'm in a hurry. Where's your boss? I am the boss here. Don't be ridiculous. Back home, I've got more than 7 million addicts who need their daily fix. But due to the problems between you guys, I can't supply them. I need you guys to stop fighting. Or the Russians will sell them Asian heroin, and we'll be out of business. So what do we do? I propose a ceasefire. We need to define some very clear boundaries which you will respect. What about us? I'll give you a bigger slice of the pie. I can't do business with the son of a bitch that made a mess of my wedding. I didn't send those guys to your wedding. But you killed 12 of my men, you bastard. Plus you burnt a ton of my cocaine. You were the first one to break the rule of not hurting our families. That was you, you fucking coward. My wife is in jail because of you. But I'll get you for that. The cops got your woman, not me. That mess was your doing. I'll kill your whole family and you too. This is exactly what I mean, gentlemen. If you don't cool it, the Russians and the Chinese will eat us alive. This little game of yours is a waste of time. I've got a lot of money, white girl, much more than you ever thought. So I'll just wait until these two fuck up each other's mom. Money is just paper, Cortez. You've got money. And I've got power. Don't mix them up, they're not the same thing. Money is power. Power? I'm not letting some fucking broad tell me what to do. Assholes. What about you? What do you think? That's fine with me. Section B, meet your new roommate. Shut up assholes, I'm talking. Her name is Montserrat, and I'm warning you, she's off limits. What, is she a nun? Who is she? Montserrat is Nuro Vega's wife. That's right, him. Mess with her, and you get what you deserve. Magos, look after her. Watch it, that old bitch is a dyke. Zip it, Yolanda! If your husband is Nuro Vega, you're walking pretty soon. If money's the issue, Cristobal and Carlos would be alive. It's all about honor. I'm not losing a stash that big. Cristobal took the secret to his grave, what can I do? You see those cameras? They cover all of Capadocia, every nook and cranny. It's not in the street, so it's still in here. Find it. There you are, Teresa. Meet my business partner Emiliano Trevino. This is Capadocia's director, Mrs. Teresa Lagos. How do you do. Nice to meet you, but you can't be here. Hey, he's with me. No, the lady's right. Thank you for understanding. See him out. This way please. We need to talk Federico. What is Nuro Vega's wife doing here? She was kidnapped, not arrested. She uses her vast estate to grow poppies. She is clearly just a front. I don't know that. It's a favor they asked Exo for. You don't know what you're getting into. You know what? I've had it with your hysterics. I'm not to blame. You're just another employee and if you don't like it here, feel free to quit, and make my day. I'm so worried, I haven't seen a cent yet. Don't worry honey. They're holding it for when you get out. They are? Sure, and how is your therapy going with that doctor? Great, we talk a lot. He's my buddy. Your buddy? What do you talk about with your buddy? About when I was a kid. The Vina del Mar festival. What it's like to sing on television. Lots of stuff. Lots of stuff? Now you tell me. How many albums have I sold? A million, baby. I'm sorry, Mercedes, I can't keep you in here any longer just for smuggling. I don't care, I'm not leaving until that woman is dead. Let Blanca do it. That's what she's here for. I want her to know why she's going to die. I'll tell her so myself. You do your job. I need more time. I thought Blanca was going to kill me. But she kissed me instead. She kissed me, and I've never been so wet in my life. That's bad, right? Why? Why is that bad? Because I love Lorena. Gosh Doc, could you explain something I still don't get? How do you, if you love somebody, get all wet for someone else? Well, it's an involuntary reaction on your part. It's a... a human need. It is? Give me something to cure me, doctor. Please, I beg you. Give me something so I'll only get wet for Lorena. And get rid of all the heat I stir up between my legs, when I touch myself here. Right here. I just can't take it. Take a look. Come here. Come here, come. Come see how I get. Come here Doc, come. If the doc doesn't come to you... you go to the doctor, right Doc? Come here. Be gentle. Very gentle. Gently like that. That's it. Easy, easy, easy, that's it. That's it. That's it. Yes, Doc, yes! God that's good! Where's dad? Getting accustomed to the house. Is he going to walk again? I don't know. Please ask him to come and see me. Sure. Check that out. Did you do this? This is awesome. It's a surprise. He'll love it. Mom get me out of here please. I can't take it anymore. Then guess what that jerk said. He wanted to buy off my entire territory. Then he brought a Gringa in to control our business. What a jerk. What about the shipment to L.A.? Don't blow it this time. And Meza gets all of this. The Gulf Coast could be yours too. Great Diane. Briton or Brighton? Doctor, I'm here because... I need to talk about the profession's limits. The limits... of passion. The limits of desire. The limits of guilt. Today, I had sex with a patient. And I'm on the verge of... I'm on the verge of violating our doctor-patient privilege. But we would all benefit. This could help Teresa. It could help Teresa Lagos. As for me... Capadocia is suffocating me. Capadocia is killing me. - You like it? - Yes. This cellphone is yours. This is our little secret. Don't tell your brothers now. If you ever need me, just press 1, and the green button. Repeat that. - Who takes it? Me. Dad. Are you going to leave us all alone? I have to go to a meeting at the office, baby, but I won't be long, I promise. That's what it's for. If you or your brothers need anything. Off to bed now. It's late. He's not answering. Be quiet please. Teresa, it's Felipe. I need to tell you something. You and Santiago. It's very important. It's about a patient. Don't leave Capadocia. I'm on my way. Wait, wait. - But why? - Beats me, I got paid. Good morning. That song, compatriot... - What? - Brings memories. No way. Bad memories. They played it at my wedding to that bastard, and he loved it. He loved it? What happened to him? They killed him. What a shame. I wanted to do it myself. Was the guy that bad? What? He was a criminal. A DEA son of a bitch made a total fool of me. So he just killed him. Those DEA bastards. What's the name of the bastard that did you the favor? No, I talk about the deed but not the doer. Mercedes Santamaria. Some guys are here to see you. Who are they? Get dressed. - Hi there. - Hi. That looks so good. You did this? Me and Mom. - I need a favor. - What? Take me to school. I always go alone. Come on. There's a condition. - What? Right. You're just lazy. Sit down. It's good. How are my kids? Are they alright? The truth. Is Patrick behaving? I'll bring them here if you want. Well, let me know if you hear anything. Visiting hours are over. Visiting hours are over. What's going on here? Please tell them they can't just drag me out of here. There's nothing we can do. What do you mean? I'm not going anywhere. - Tell that to the judge. - I have nothing to tell him. We tried everything already. Well try again. I'll get you for this. Why don't you do your fucking job? Visitors must leave now. Visitors must leave now. Crazy bitch. Let her in. Mrs. Teté, I need to tell you something. If it's another case of mass hysteria, tell the doctor. It's about the doctor. He was murdered. But I have a... When? Last night. It looks like a mugging. Thank you. Teresa, it's Felipe. I need to tell you something. You and Santiago. It's very important. It's about a patient. Don't leave Capadocia. I'm on my way. Wait, wait. - But why? - Beats me, I got paid.
