 - Please, please, mom. - It's up to your dad. Dad, all my friends have sleepovers I'm never allowed to go to. Just this time, please. I would need to talk to his parents. - Julián is my best friend. - But we don't know the others. That's enough, okay? That's enough. I'll be waiting for you outside your school. Behave yourself and don't soil your sweater. Yes mom.

 - Bye mom. - Take care. - I'll be home early. - Bye. You let the Colombian get away. Don't expect me to take the fall for you. If they find out you let her out, Isabel, you're the one that's going down. I'm sending Teresa Lagos a full report about this, and I'm copying the Governor, then I'll quit. In my opinion, and that of the media if they find out, it's your fault the Colombian escaped from Capadocia. I can prove I wasn't in Mexico. I was never involved in any kind of corruption, so you can't blackmail me. If I go down, I'm taking you with me.

 Is that a threat? No, I'm just telling you how it is. They'll hunt her down as soon as they know she's gone. Allow me to remind you that you did all of this to save your dad's hide. Now you're saying you're willing to take the blame for this? Just remember your dad isn't as good as you are. The General murdered an innocent man, and he'll pay for it in prison. That man wasn't innocent. He wasn't?, so I guess I misread the report, and all the evidence I was shown. Let's go back a bit Isabel. There was a trial and your dad carried out a death sentence. But there's no death sentence in Mexico, isn't that weird? If he's tried, your dad will get the maximum sentence. How old is he? Sixty, seventy? He'd rot in jail, Isabel. Your dad, General Clavé, the pride and joy of the Mexican army. Your report needs to say the Colombian's in hospital. So thank you for coming. Go back to work now. Give my regards to the General. The cafeteria supplier's agreement, and this quarter's reports. Thanks. Do you know why Consuelo Ospino is hospitalized? I asked why she missed her 10 o'clock appointment. They said she was hospitalized. Bambi is in solitary confinement, and both events seem to be related somehow. Liliana, please get the number of the hospital Consuelo Ospino is at, thank you. Could you see Bambi? I can't stand that woman. - Is there something else? - What are you looking for? Is it that deep, or can't you look at me? I already saw you Burián, and I have a lot on my mind. I'll call you as soon as I hear something about Consuelo. Thanks Liliana. How are you doctor? I know that, I just need to know how she's doing. She needs an operation. She has a few cysts in her ovaries, so we need to operate. What? That's what this job is like. We have to expect the unexpected at all times. I suppose in yourjob you've had to face these... imponderables. Of course doctor. Thank you, and please keep me updated. Yes ma'am. I have news for you about Consuelo, she's fine. She needs an operation, but she's fine. Yes. Right. Do you really think I'd believe that? What are you doing to my woman? Where is she? Shut up, you hear me? Say something stupid like that to me or anybody else, and face the consequences. Is that clear? I told her she had to pay me. She made me work all night, iron five dozen items, and then tried to stiff me, what an abuse. I need to go to the bathroom. Just remember. Behave. Don't do anything stupid. Understood? - Yes. - The gun's right here. Alright. Come on. Some people are like that, you know. This way, this way. Here we are. Turn around and sit down. Here? Yes. That's it. Did you sleep well? Yes. Don't worry. You'll be out of here soon. When? Soon, very soon. When? As soon as your husband shows up with the money, you'll be out of here. So don't worry about it. You'll be fine. Now I'll let you relax for a little while. Give me your hands. Don't try anything. Easy, easy, I'm almost done. Now you can rest a little. Can I see that one? No, not that one. The other one. That one, that one. This is so nice. How much is it? That's 1500 pesos. It's really nice. I like this one. I'll take it. What is this? This is so nice. How much is this? That's 3000 pesos. Three thousand? I'll take it. This one too? Yes. How much is everything? - That'll be 4500 pesos. - 4500? God will provide. These are really nice. Thank you ma'am. Thank you. Have a nice day. Dr. González, please come to the operating room. The number you are calling is out of coverage. Strip. Please get me some bandages. What for? Let me see. Incredible. What about down there? You are a woman from head to toe. Strip. - Please get me some bandages. - I said strip. - Can I help you? - Yes, I'll take these. Allow me. Never mind. I'm definitely taking these. Right. We need to talk. We're in trouble. I'm on my way. Thanks. Bye. Did you see them take the Colombian to hospital? Yes, why? I needed to confirm that with you, and the infirmary's report. She collapsed on her way back to her cell from the mess hall. The nurse thought it was best to send her to hospital. See for yourself. This is her being taken away. Bambi's in solitary because she hit her? She went ballistic when they took the Colombian away. She assaulted the guard and started shouting that someone takes her away at night. Can you believe that? Why would she say that? I don't know, Bambi is very violent. I think she is delusional. She might even hear voices. Who knows what else? But aren't you the expert? What do you think? I'll work on it... if you don't mind, that is. Of course not. Quit pacing. You're making me nervous. Your putt sir. It looks like the earth swallowed the bitch. My men will find her pretty soon... for your sake. As you will surely understand, Sister Marion's situation is a very delicate matter. I know that. If she can't be interrogated, there's very little we can do for her. I understand you ordered them not to. Our therapist says she can't be interrogated, but I'm glad the church is so concerned about her. The church is very concerned about Sister Marion. But also the media. Nobody wants a scandal, neither us nor Sister Marion, or the Governor. And I'm sure you don't either. We need to wait until she feels better. That's all I can do. I'm sure you wouldn't want her to be tortured. It's just an interrogation. Why would they have to hit her? Psychological stress is another kind of torture. Mrs. Lagos... I am sure Sister Marion needs confession badly. Also spiritual guidance. May I do that for her? Lalo, it's Consuelo. How are you doing? Long time no see. I need your help. I broke out of jail. Where are you? Don't tell anyone, Lalo. Alcántara will kill me if he finds out. Nobody remembers any of that. We're buddies, tell me where to pick you up. No, you know what? Just tell me where to meet you. Remember where Wini's bar is? Pepito's place? I do. I remember. I'll be there. Meet me there at 10 p.m. But listen, Lalo, please don't snitch on me, okay? I wouldn't dream of it. I'll be expecting you. We found her. Didn't I tell you we would? Really? My God. I didn't get a wink's sleep last night. If not, we're screwed. "We" is a lot of people. I told you I'm in Rome. Didn't I make myself clear? Get out of my way. Don't step on the turf. Don't stand behind me. What did he do? She... or he was convicted of embezzlement. But he used the money for a sex change surgery. This is amazing. He's a woman. That's why it took so long to catch him. But the point is, imagine what they'll do to him in a men's jail. Then he'd really be in trouble. I knew our holy mother the church would not forsake me. Thank you for coming, Your Eminence. You are in big trouble, but you're not alone. Thank you. You've implicated everything you claim to care about. You have sinned against God and the church, broken the laws of man, and put many people in danger. My kids. Are my kids alright? Your kids have no one now, thanks to you. You committed a very serious offence. A terrible one. Father, my kids weren't only dying of cancer. They were starving. I had to give God a hand in order to save them. You will not take the name of the Lord in vain, much less to justify your crime. I could make sure that your kids get the kind of care they need. But you must do as I say. If you don't, people will be suspicious of the church. And I'll be forced to excommunicate you. No Father, not that. Then you will observe your vow of obedience. Tell me the truth. Is Father Jorge involved? Who else? The interrogation is over. This is not an interrogation and you have no right to interrupt me. I let you see her to give her some sort of spiritual guidance, but you have abused my trust, so I have to ask you to leave. You did what was expected of you. Thank you. It's alright. Are you okay? Are you going out? Are these mine? Yes. I just have to tell him where to drop off the money. Her husband is cooperating. Don't worry, honey. It's alright. We've done this before. You need to be patient. I'm scared our friends could find out. Don't worry about it. We'd never make enough working for our friends. Not like this. This is the last time. Don't worry honey. Hang in there. Nothing's going to happen. I will call if I need you. Sorry, doctor, my orders are not to leave her alone. I will call you if I need you. Thank you. You assaulted a guard yesterday. Why? Why ask me? Pull out my file. If that's what it says, that's it. You've got a lot of spunk, haven't you? You feel powerful. The criminal genius. You're smart. Not as much as you are. They locked you up for a minor offence. Then you killed two guards, which made sure you'd be here for the rest of your days. Congratulations. Yesterday's outburst... You'd better go, before I have another fit. Why do you claim Consuelo is smuggled out of the jail? Don't play dumb, Doc. You know what goes on in here. We can prove she was admitted at the hospital. Can you really? You're so full of it... Dr. Burián. I could care less. They must've brainwashed her like the rest of these jerks. This model penitentiary stinks like hell. What do you think is wrong with it? Have you seen that Colombian? Sure you have. Everybody in here has seen her. Did you screw her? She's is so hot, right? Where do you think she is? What? You screwed her, didn't you? They smuggle her out of here so somebody can screw her. - Get against the wall. - Okay, okay. One wrong move and I'll Taser you. - Shut up. - You heard me. Okay. What happened? Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm okay. What did she say? She swears they smuggle the Colombian out, and I don't think she's lying. No, I don't think Isabel would allow it. I don't like her methods, but she is disciplined and irreproachable. Easy. Put that down. I'll do that. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of her. We're taking you home. I've told you a million times not to be nice to them. Please don't gag me again. Shut up or I'll kill you. Okay, okay. I'll take care of her. I won't talk to her anymore. Go back to work, it's getting late. It's alright. Your husband loves you. He will do as we say and we'll let you go. You just need to cooperate. Don't make things any worse than they are, and you'll be fine. Francisco Antonio Benítez. Move it. Cool it boys. Cool it I said. Cool it, cool it. Faggot. Please don't put me in there. I have to be by myself. You'll be fine. Come here baby. Please don't leave me in here. You'll be fine. I hope we get there in time. It all depends on traffic, which is unpredictable in this city. We're still on time. Lorena. I spoke with your lawyer. We will appeal as many times as it takes. Don't give up yet. Excuse me. Get back to your cells. Get back to your cells. Hello. The movie is at 6. We have lots of time for a drink first. I'm still at work. I admire your tenacity. Unlike you, Lorena gave up already. Was I supposed to sit there and do nothing? Don't get mad at me, I just want you to know how much I admire your sense of justice. I need to set a precedent. In spite of the issues it's causing you? Let's go. - Hello. - Yes? It's Daniel. What are you doing? My stupid homework. All hell broke loose at dinner after you left. I can imagine. Would you like to go out for a coffee or something? I could pick you up. Sure. Hi Antonio. Teresa Lagos. - Hi. - José Burián. Hi. I'm sorry, they won't let me take my hormones. We're here to chat with you. Yours is a very complex case. Your file says you got a sex change with some money you embezzled. I couldn't afford to make my body look like who I really am. I couldn't take it anymore. It was either that or losing my mind. Yes but you committed a crime. Didn't it occur to you? I didn't get caught because of my crime. I got caught because I'm dumb and pretentious. Tell us about the last two years. What was your life like after the surgery? It has been just that, a life. My life. Before, I just dragged a body around that wasn't mine. The first thing I did, was rush out of the clinic to get deflowered. And I loved it. You have no idea how I loved being a woman. Then I made myself pretty. I met the man of my life. But I stole some panties, and that was that. That's two years in a nutshell. Please, you have to help me. Get me out of here. This is no place for a woman. Please get me out of here. Get off of me. You little slut. Get out of here. What can you do for us? You know better than anyone else the huge issues we face on account of the overcrowding of our prisons. I can't isolate an inmate. If that's what you want, I'm sorry, I can't do that. This inmate faces a lot of danger. But he is a man, Teresa. All of his papers say he's a man. So if they try to rape him, he just has to wave his ID at them, and they won't molest him? I promise he'll have a special guard to protect him. That won't do. What about one of the cells you reserve for those who can afford certain privileges? White collar offenders, for example? That doesn't happen here in my prison. Really? That's great. Then you won't mind if me and my Human Rights friends come to pay your prison a little visit? I'll see what I can do to help this... this inmate. I hope so. Goodbye. Alright. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Okay, okay, I can walk. They've got me cornered, dad. Isabel, you should never have done something like that. You've put your career at risk, and you did from the day you took that job. You helped someone smuggle an inmate out? I had no choice dad. I don't know how, but Cristóbal Saenz has pictures, and testimonies of Ariel's relatives. Look. He is obviously very well connected. He has a tape of someone who claims he saw you that night. And proof that you killed him. What else could I do? That damn judge set the bastard free. You stood up for me, dad. There is nothing to feel guilty about. You're paying for something I did, and I will not allow it. I'm going to put a stop to this once and for all. Dad, please, I just came to warn you, before things get worse. Hi. Where's Jaime? Don't get mad at me, Roberto. I let him sleep over at his friend's. Pick him up first thing tomorrow and stay at your mom's place. Why? They're dropping off the money tomorrow. I don't want you to be here when I take her away. Thank God it's finally over. How about some nice tacos for dinner? I'm not hungry. I have to talk to her. Her husband had some questions to make sure she's okay. Don't forget to wear the ski mask. I took the blindfold off so she could watch TV. And don't be too hard on the poor woman. Alright. What's a hot chick like you doing in such an unsafe place? You need a bodyguard, baby. I'm okay. Somebody's expecting me. I could wait for you in case he doesn't show up. No, don't worry about me. No thank you. You're still here, Mrs. Lagos. I'm so sorry I can't see you today. - We'll talk on the way. - We have nothing to talk about. You pulled a lot of strings to get Mrs. Guerra convicted of murder. I will do you a favor and forget you were ever here. That won't bring your daughter back. Or is this another of your bouts of abuse of power you so frequently use? I urge you to watch your mouth madam. Your impertinence could hurt your husband. Don't you threaten me, judge, it could backfire on you. I hope you can prove that. Because I'll sue you for defamation if you can't. I will appeal right up to the supreme court if I have to. Lorena Guerra will be freed. Not all our courts are filled with corrupt judges. Trust me. Get my car. Marion. Marion. Marion. Marion, Marion. Are you alright? Yes, yes. Are you a real nun? Yes I am, but I don't know if I've been excommunicated. That must be tough. How long have you been a nun? About forty years. I took my vows when I was fifteen. I'm glad you're here with us. I mean, sometimes we really need to pray, and it's good to have a direct link to God. There's a devout follower of Holy Death, but it's not the same. All followers of Holy Death are demons from hell. They are damned. My God. But your saints are of no use to us. They turned their backs on us a long time ago. You are damned too. Are you sure I shouldn't wait for you? We can go dancing or something later. - No, thanks. - How about dinner? Keep the change. Come on baby. I'm all fired up here. Move it, move it. Get me out of here. Yes? You idiots. Keep looking. Go to the hospital. Tell the doctor to find someone to replace her. He will refuse. Of course not. And stay there. If we don't find her by tomorrow morning, make sure the woman doesn't leave there alive. Sure. The Colombian died during surgery. What a shame. She didn't make it. Thanks boss. - You're safe, baby. - Yes. Good. You feel safer now, right? You promised me a good time. So let's do it. Come on baby. God you're hot. Listen up idiot. Don't make me get mad. If I don't get my money by tomorrow, I'll start sending you your wife in bits and pieces. Don't try to make me talk to trace my call. Just do your part of the deal. Good evening, I'm here to see Dr. López Vega. Good evening, he is in surgery right now. Can I take a message? How is Miss Ospino doing? The prisoner? She's in the operating room. There he is. - Are you Dr. López Vega? - Yes. How do you do, I am Dr. Burián, I work at Capadocia. How is Consuelo Ospino? I'm sending her to the ER. Her condition is serious. - May I have her chart? - Yes doctor. Could you please help me? - What's wrong white girl? - I need to get out of here. Why do you want to leave? Come here, don't be afraid. The anesthesia had a bad effect on her, probably because of her substance abuse. How is she? We don't know for sure what'll happen, but her condition is critical. This says she was conscious when she was admitted, but it doesn't say why she collapsed. Do you have any idea why? The cyst could've been too painful. Was she delirious? No she wasn't. Please excuse me. It's been a long day. Thanks. What happened to you, my friend? Some damn woman did this to me. A white girl? Yes, and she's pretty hot. She was just here. We'll help you look for her. Let's help our friend. - Thanks. Let's go. - Let's go. You startled me. Why are you up so late? I checked out a noise I heard and then I went to the bathroom. Want some water? Try to get some sleep. Where are you? We'll get you bitch. Hello. Cristóbal. Forgive me. Forgive me. They're going to kill me. Where are you? I don't know. All I know is it's a deserted warehouse, in front of a gas station, please get me out of here. I repeat: A deserted warehouse in front of a gas station. Don't worry, honey. Someone will be right over. Hurry up please. They're going to kill me. - Where are you? - Hurry up, please, please. Right now. We'll get you bitch. Hello. Federico, cancel the job on the substitute Colombian. Yes, she showed up. I can't sleep. - Are you ill? - No. Do you want me to read you a story? Don't be ridiculous, mom. I'm not a baby. But you're so busy maybe you haven't noticed. My life is very complicated, but I do love you. Your daughters are a part of your complicated life, that you've always neglected. I know it's tough. But just imagine, if I didn't do what I'm so passionate about, I would be on top of you guys all the time. And a bitter woman would make a horrible mom. You'll understand when you grow up and have your own career. Will you stop lecturing me? Don't try to turn this around and scold me instead. - Where is your sister? - I have no idea. She's the one I'll scold for leaving you all alone. Mom, I don't need a nanny. Good night honey. What are you doing here? What's your problem? Those keys are only to bring your kids home. Judge Cedeńo is furious. How dare you threaten him in his own chambers? Is that what he said? Leave him alone, please. I don't want any more problems. That woman... What about her? I don't get it. Why do you care so much? She has been sentenced, she's just another inmate. None of them is just another inmate, much less when it's so unfair. Her trial was riddled with incongruities. And he is the victim's father. What a coincidence. She killed a man. She pushed the victim in a fit of anger, accidentally causing her death. She caught her husband in bed with another woman. You're stirring up a hornet's nest. Judge Cedeńo broke the law in order to convict her. Don't you know how powerful Diego Cedeńo is? Of course I do, and a few years ago, you too would've been outraged. What, are you trying to cut a deal with him? It won't work, Santiago, unless you'd do anything to be reelected. Don't be ridiculous, Teresa. You know perfectly well I'd never include a corrupt man like him on my platform, as if you didn't know me. That is my point precisely. You think you know someone but you don't, because of the secrets, lies, and cheating. Things you'd never imagine of that person. What are you talking about? If you have something to say to me, just say it. Thanks for taking me to the movies. You're welcome. I'd better go, dad is here, and mom must be hysterical. Call me tomorrow, okay? Okay. You never said why you wanted a divorce, and you refuse to say what offended you so much. - You know what you did. - What did I do, Teresa? Go right on fighting. Don't mind me. How about some music to cover up your yelling? Do you know what time it is, young lady? Calm down dad. It's not that late. Good night. Good night Teresa. Good night honey. You'll take me far away from here, won't you honey? Let's go to Miami, or anywhere you want. I'll make you happy. What a shame, you used to be my favorite plaything. Take her away. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Go. Daughter. You look weird. Are you alright? Apart from the fact that my life is over, and my kids don't recognize me, I'm fine Mom. You've gotten so cold. Don't let this place change you. I can either change or die. Which do you prefer? Are you feeling better? Let me take a look at you. How did you get here? What happened was... my stomach started hurting like hell and... And I blacked out, and then... That's why they rushed me to the ER. And when I came to, the doctor said he had to operate right away, to remove the cysts in my ovaries or something. I don't really remember. That's all I know. He also said that you came to see me. Was the dislocation before or after your surgery? I don't know. I blacked out. I don't know, I really don't. I'm so tired and I can't remember. I'm so sorry, but I'm exhausted. You can tell me if you're being molested. I'm fine. No, I'm fine. I'm tired, but I'm fine. Don't worry. Soon you'll be back at Capadocia. Why do we have to go back to the stationer's? Is this every afternoon? I need a pad for my math class, mom. Okay, go change before we go to grandma's place. Yes mom. Jaime. IJaime! My God. Wait for me outside, alright? We've got your wife. Did you hear that, you idiot? What's so funny? Nothing. Ajudge agreed with me, and granted Lorena a retrial. You got what you wanted. - This calls for a celebration. - Let's have dinner together. - Okay. - Let's go. He beat me up all the time. Son of a bitch! I'll kill you! Get off of me! I'll kill him! Get off of me! - It was her idea. - Liar! She says you're an idiot. Admit it, we planned the whole thing together. No Juan, he and his wife kidnapped me, I swear. Juan. iJuan! Hi princess. I'm here now, my love. You'll be fine as long as I'm with you, Consuelo. It's over. You will... You will protect me, won't you?
