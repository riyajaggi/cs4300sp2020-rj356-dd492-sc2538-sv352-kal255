 with good thoughts. With good deeds. And may He forgive you your sins. Amen. Aren't these funerals infuriating? Such a brilliant young doctor, with such a promising future that suddenly comes to an end. He must have had just 100 or 500 pesos on him. What are you looking for? Can I help? No thanks. I'm packing Felipe's things to send them to his family. Right. Alvaro is in your office. He needs to talk to you. Can you come with me? Sure, in just a minute. You go right ahead. Alright. Okay. What do I do now that they took her away? The deal's the same. Your freedom and 2 million dollars for doing what Esmeralda asked you to. How do I know you'll keep her part of the deal? How much do you think someone like me charges to defend someone like you? >From now on I am Esmeralda's eyes and ears in here. You'll give me her brother's killers. It's true. The lawyer told me so. How many? - I even painted it here. - A million? I swear. My attorney said so. I've been on the charts for three weeks. You're nuts. It's not on the radio. Because these bitches filter everything we hear. Teresa Lagos who hates my guts banned all my songs in here. She can't do that. Sure she can. She's the warden. She'll have a fit when I win a Grammy when I get out of here. You're never getting it out so have it sent to you. Pay no attention to her, girl. Sure you'll get out. Eat your dinner. - Hello. - Come over here Montse. And now Magos is there, looking after her. What are those two marks on her face? Those are her killings. - Her what? - The women she killed. I'm sorry, but as far as I know, the appointment of the head of psychiatry is not to be decided by Exo or its vice president. Let's get straight to the point, madam. Since I became Exo's CEO, I've had the impression that you don't like me. And that's important, since I have exactly the same impression about you. To be honest with you, I've never liked the idea of having the warden of the country's first privately run prison who is also the mother of a criminal. You can afford to have corrupt executives, what's the big deal? That's enough Teresa. You're in no position to criticize anyone. Some of the directors want you to resign. I'd expect a little more dignity on your part. It is precisely out of dignity that I refuse to resign. Neither of you have the right to ask me to, much less to fire me. Then I'll have a word with the mayor. Do whatever you want. You shouldn't mess with Alvaro. You're only making sure you get sacked. I almost forgot, some workers will be here tomorrow to check the gas and water connections. No, it's not that easy, Federico. I need to plan what to do with the inmates. No problem. Send them out to the yard. I'll inspect everything myself. I'll be back in a moment for the memo, thank you. I had a bellyache all night, I couldn't sleep. But of course, he was the only guy we had, and now he's dead. He didn't like you either? That damn shrink. I hit on him like a thousand times and he never even touched me. Girl! What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I'm a little sad, but I'm fine. I think you did him. That's what's bugging you. Of course not. What are you saying? He was a gentleman, and I don't need any of that. So why did they kill the shrink? - They killed the doctor? - Are you deaf or what? This jerk only hears herself. Why did they kill him? For snooping around. Dinnertime is over. This one did him for sure. - Body of Christ. - Amen. Juan. Juan. Juan. What's going on? What are you doing here? Come with me. Hello. How are you dad? I'm fine, honey. How are you? Are you eating? Yes. Take care of yourself. I'm holding... the relief sculpture you made me. He's even balder than I am. He looks just like me. - I miss you a lot. - Dad. Yes honey? Please get me out of here. I can't take it anymore. Dad. Are you okay? You know everything. Why is the shrink dead? Get back to work. Negra, please. Why did they kill him? - Keep your trap shut. - Please Negra. Warden! Would you like a week in the punishment cell? What's going on? Nothing, Warden. There's been a minor case of insubordination, but I've got it under control. Right? Look over there. They're talking to you. You said you had it all under control. And I did. I don't know what happened. What happened? Your nutcase, your artist talks too much, and now we've got another corpse on our hands. I warned Cristobal. I told him it was very risky to think some nutcase could get rid of Santiago, and see what happened? Nobody's linked the shrink's death to Brenda Yamilet. No, but for how much longer? How long are we to wait for that to happen? Until that madwoman talks to someone else? Then what'll we do? Kill everybody she tells her little secret? I'll ask Sergio to talk to her. You'll do no such thing. >From now on, I want all your people out of there. Nobody's to contact her. Give me another chance, I promise... I promise... Exo... is opening ten more prisons. You think I'll risk such a huge investment for some nutcase? Are you insane? And? And... I'm in charge from now on. What else? Hi dad. What's wrong? What is it? Nothing, I'm fine. Mom told you not to read this. You know it's bad for you. I'm fine. She told you not to. It's bad for you. Leave me alone, damn it! - You need to watch it with her. - She's okay. Yes but her husband is who he is. And with those people, you have to be careful. Why talk to her if you're so scared of her? I'm way past good and evil. If that Nuro guy has my head cut off, I don't care. But you my child... Why take that risk? Be careful. Shift two now begins at the workshop. - See you later then. - Alright. Just stay put in your cot, alright? How about a moreliana? They're nice and fresh. I just got them from Durango. Okay. What flavor are they? These are milk candy with nuts. Come, sit here. I got her five years sir. Fuck that. Five years? The poor girl did nothing. The judge admitted the district attorney's evidence, snapshots of your wife in the poppy fields. Plus her profession. Fuck the district attorney and his mother too. Just bride the judge. I tried too, he said no. Doesn't the jerk know who he's dealing with? I'll send that judge a message. Sir, I don't think that's a good idea right now. If I get the judge, the attorney general... I pay you a ton of money, counselor. And don't you forget it. Yes sir. Gangster attorneys. Did he talk yet? He did. The idiot resisted some but he talked alright. You were right. It wasn't Mendez who attacked us at the wedding. Who then? The Gringa, Diane Brighton. That fucking bitch. Do I kill him? No. Let him die on his own. - This stuff will make us fat. - They're so good. Don't worry, I'll have them send us some more. So, does your mom really run this place? So why are you here? Why won't she get you out? She's just the warden. She doesn't decide who goes in or out. You must've done something really bad, right? I robbed a jewelry store. You needed money? I was mad at her. I did it to get back at her. Guess why I'm here. For growing flowers and falling in love. You grow poppies. What's wrong with growing flowers? Poppies are so pretty. You should've seen my wedding. There were lots of poppy arrangements. My great-grandmother made them. Everything was fine until those bastards came. They killed everybody. They started killing the kids and then they killed... the women, my best friend and Mama Nati. I know Nuro will get them. That's my only satisfaction. He'll kill those bastards nice and slow. What? Don't you want them to nab the bitch that shot your dad and make her pay? Am I forgiven for being such a jerk? You're not a jerk. Yes I am. I'm a bitter, pathetic jerk, who can't even think because of the rage inside of him. I spent half of my life seeking... a way to... To do something I've always believed in. I wanted to be president because I had plans for this country. But they got me out of the way. And they destroyed an entire life's work. And a lot of people who believed in our plan. Like your mom. And that hurts. It hurts a lot more than being in this wheelchair. But I promise... to keep all that rage to myself. You can take it out on me anytime. I love you dad. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is Father Nicolas' girlfriend. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. Shut up. That's a lie. - Juan is the priest's girl. - That's a lie. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. That's not true. That's a lie. Shut up. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. That's a lie. That's a lie! Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. I'm sorry my child. I have to lock up now. Wait. Don't mind me. You don't kick anyone out of the house of God. I think I've seen you a lot, around here maybe? Yes. I came to see if I can have a word with you. What about, my child? I've lost my faith Father. Take holy communion every day. Nourish your soul with the flesh of Christ. We can't live without believing in someone or something. Can you help me? Yes, my child, yes. Come in then. Did you talk to Lorena? I already told you she knows nothing. Federico, I would know. Your ex boss stole the drugs and took the secret to his grave. That jerk didn't have the balls to pull that off. Find it or else. I'm not kidding you. What about her? I need time. Don't tell me you need more time. Do it today Negra. Today, today, today. Is that clear? Sergio, where are you? I know you're there. You promised to get me out after the elections, and they're over and I'm stuck in here. Now it's important that you get me out. Please pick up the phone! - Okay. - Name. - Burian. - Burian. Fifty. - Country. - Buenos Aires. That's not a country, stupid. She hasn't been anywhere. You get zero. I get 100. - Object. - Bars. Kiss. A little kiss. Kiss me. She's your new cellmate. Inmate Lorena Guerra report to the office. - That's not your cell. - You're coming with me. Watch my card. - I've got 500, you 450. - I know. I know. - So? - So what? You like me being here? What do you want? I want to do some dirty stuff with you. Why are you so scared of me? You look at me funny. Because I like you. Why else? Seriously, stop it. Leave me alone. If Lorena finds out I'll be in trouble. She doesn't love you. But I love her. Love is a two way street. It's dumb otherwise. She looks right through you. That's fine with me. The people that loved me only got me in trouble. Don't talk like that. That's so sad. Why do you think I'm in here? Because of a guy that loved me a lot. Poor thing. I feel like pampering you even more. - No, please stop it. - Yes. Yes. - No. Stop it. Stop it. - Yes. Yes. Yes. Federico's having the maintenance crew inspect the prison. You're just a kid here. - Having trouble, Teresa? - Yes and I need your help. We hid it real good. They'll never find it. Federico's going to look real good too. I told you to get it out of here. Security is so tight not even I can do that. I know you don't give a damn. But I have a lot to lose. My family even. Forget about them. You'll sleep better. Don't be so cynical. I know Carmen takes care of your kids. You don't think they'd be at risk too? Alright, I'll help you out, but you owe me more than ever. When do you plan to tell me what you want in exchange? There's no hurry, for now all I need is to get out of my cell when they get here, and go down to the basement. Alright. I'll handle Negra. Fine, when will they be here? That can change, honey. You'll trade Romelia for me? Sure you can trade her. She's a lot cuter. Sure, I know, but... You're leaving with her? - With her? - Let's elope. Don't be like that. I was just about to say yes. Don't be like that. Shut up. Andrea. They're talking about your dad. The conspiration theory is still being... Please stop this ridiculous story. Marin was shot by a crazy... I'm not crazy! Get out of the way, idiot. What a jerk. I am not mentally disturbed. I'm Brenda Yamilet, I saved the country. The conspiracy theory is still believed to... You should thank me. I saved this country. Do not intervene. Stop it! Get out of my way. Andrea, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Calm down! Calm down! Stop it Andrea! I said stop it. Why didn't you stop her? She's your daughter, ma'am. The guards didn't dare to stop her. And I was too far. Take her to the doctor. - I'm going to kill you. - Stop it. I swear I'll kill you. What's going to happen to Andrea? The rule is that... I know what the rule is. Take her to the punishment cell. No mom. No mom! Teresa! Teresa, don't! Teresa! Teresa! Back to your cells. The show is over. All inmates go back to your cells. Go back to your cells. All inmates. For four years he raped him. >From five to nine years of age. He said Mass after he raped him. My little brother hanged himself at ten. From a beam. So you see Father? That's how I lost my faith. I see how tormented you are my child. God is just testing you. But your reward will be even greater as long as you past the test. You think so Father? I am totally convinced. Pray, pray, my child, for God to renew your faith. And for Him to forgive your brother. He committed the mortal sin of suicide. I need to forgive the priest too? Although he ruined the lives of so many kids, driving them to madness, suicide. He ruined entire families that trusted him. Must I also forgive the priest? The priest has his own devils to deal with. His appetites which are so human are the test that God sent him. But if he truly repents, he can be forgiven. You think so, Father Nicolas? Pedro, my child. My name is Pedro. No, Nicolas Valtierra Nunez, from Taguacan, Puebla, ordained on May 3, 1974. I studied Catechism with you from November to January 1979. They almost hanged you from the flagpole. My family had to move away while you stayed here, saying Mass as if nothing happened. - You're mistaken. - No I am not. You're alive because of the bishop. Then you went from parish to parish. Ten pedophile charges, Father Nicolas. Nobody knows how many kids you molested. I don't feel well my child. No, my child, no. I don't know what Father Nicolas you mean. How do I make you see this is no game, Andrea? So many women are sent here for a year and end up spending the rest of their lives here. I try to get a reduced sentence, but it just gets harder. I'm only doing this to protect you. Protect me by locking me up in a hole? Yes, if that will get you out of here, I'll keep you in here the entire six months. I know it's not easy. It's so easy for you mom. You're in your office all day. I have to live with that woman. The woman that shot dad. I swear I want to kill her. I'm not like you. I can't put up with all the crap they throw at me. You're right. I have to take tons of crap every single day. You know why I do? Why I don't explode and send all this to hell? For you. Because I won't let you destroy your life. Guard. Mom. Mom. Don't leave me in here. Mom. You can't leave me here. Mom! Mom! Mom, let me out of here! Mom, don't leave me here. Mom! Mom! Lights out. Lights out. Go to sleep. Silence. Silence. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep everybody. Juan. - What was my brother's name? - I don't know. I don't know. What was his name? You're mistaken, my child. I don't remember. You do remember what you did. No, 1, 1... I... I committed no sin of the flesh. What was my brother's name? Juan. His name was Juan. Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy... My son! Major Augusto Mateos. It's a routine procedure. What's going on? I have a warrant for her arrest. She is an American citizen. It's a matter of national security. Why? - Why? - Yes, why? For this. And this. And this. I'll call the embassy. I need you to search every nook and cranny. You all know what we're looking for. >From Mario to you go to the basements. The rest of you move it. Gate. I hope this search of yours doesn't cause a chaos. That's why I put you here. To handle any kind of chaos. What about the files? I looked for them all night and found nothing. I don't think your bloodhounds will find anything either. No? Well I hope they do for your sake. Get these women to behave. Gossip, gossip. They're all in the yard. Should I make sure the workers don't steal anything? No, I need you with the inmates. - Everything okay? - Yes. Come, keep talking. Stay out of it. Send Lorena Guerra and Consuelo Espino here. Lorena, Colombian, upstairs. Move it. The warden called. That's enough. Stop it. - Move it. - You gossip. Gate. Take them upstairs. That's enough. Somebody's coming. Come on, come on. There you are. Did you miss me? - Look who's there. - Hi there, big guy. Come over here and join us, baby. Her name is Diane Brighton, a top executive of an American stockbroker. When were these taken? Two days before Mendez, Cortez and Castelo were killed. The cartels were about to sign a peace agreement. What was she doing there? She doesn't look like it, but Blondie is responsible for all the drug distribution in northwestern USA. We finally identified the top American drug lords. Diane Brighton. And these pictures aren't a setup? No Victor, they're not. Who gave you such an awesome present? I think it's payback, sir. She killed all three bosses. It wasn't Nuro as we thought. What've we got? She's in custody, won't talk. The Gringos are pressuring me to let her go but... I'll have somebody run a background check in the States. Meanwhile with all this proof we can file charges, right? The problem will be keeping her safe. As soon as the capos know we have her they'll try to kill her. And that's where you come in, Victor. I'm sending her to Capadocia where Nuro's wife is, to keep an eye on her during your investigation. Yes sir. Okay. Thanks. The money's in the bank. The debt's settled. The drug's settled. But not the debt. I'm not responsible for Cristobal Saenz' mistakes. He was in charge of the drugs. Not me. Cristobal and Carlos aren't here, but we are. Our agreement can't terminate by imprisoning or killing any of the signees. What else can I do? Look don Alvaro, I understand. We're in the same boat here. I'm paying for my predecessor's stupidity. You know how a leader differs from a simple boss? A leader is willing to deal with other people's b.s. And I'm willing to deal with Carlos' b.s. I ask you again. What more can I do? I know what you can do. You're opening ten more prisons. You and I can do some very profitable business. I'll increase my shipments to Europe, you won't just be freed of your debt, you'll also make a huge amount of money. We're talking about lots of millions, don Alvaro. Millions. Look, Emiliano, right here in the company I've handled deals for more, many more millions. Why do you think I'm Exo's CEO? Because of my good looks? Of course not. Well? Nothing at all. They found nothing. You can't blame me for that. Can you? The idea at Capadocia was to treat inmates who could respond to rehabilitation. But what have I got? The wife of one of the most dangerous local drug lords. Drug dealers, murderers and on top of that, a woman more vicious than the Mexican drug lords? For a short time, until she can be extradited. That's what top security prisons are for. Mrs. Lagos, I need your help. I'm sorry, Mr. Attorney General, it would be much too risky for Capadocia. You know I'm under pressure to fire you. Are you threatening me? No I am not. I just want to cut a deal here. Help me keep Diane Brighton in there, and I assure you that Brenda Yamilet will be transferred. How about that? Diane Breehton, awaiting extradition, walk down the red line. Take a left. Come here. Fill out that form. Put your things in that box. Take your uniform and go see the doctor. Take your valuables off. Get out. Come on girl. The warden says you're fine. Come and take a nice shower. You too? What did you snort? Look here, girl, just because I like you I won't tell your mom you're flying like a kite. Come, you need a shower. That way. Good girl. You startled me. You majored in psychiatry in Vienna. Why do you want to be cooped up in here? We're all prisoners here. My main interest is... I'm sorry. Yes? I'll be right there. Thanks. Your qualifications are more than adequate. Welcome to Capadocia. - Thank you. - Someone will let you out. Thanks. Who the hell did this? Moreno went to register the new prisoner. She found her.
