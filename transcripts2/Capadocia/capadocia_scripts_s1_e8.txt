 How many cards? Your card, miss. What'll it be? Winner gets all. I'm out. Four of a kind. I win. Excuse me. Excuse me! I need more credit, Valentín. Teresita, you're a great client, but your credit limit is totally maxed out. I've always paid my debts.

 I know that, but we're talking about a lot of money. I still have my jewels and my truck. What about the house? Shut up. Shut up. I said shut up. Mom, Andrea's reading about virginity. Shut up or I'll hit you. Please stop it. It's nobody's business. "Make your very first time a dream come true." Mom. "Tell your companion to be gentle to avoid any pain." Where did you get that?

 "Do not be embarrassed. He will love seeing you naked." Did you hear that, mom? Mom. Mom! Did you enjoy it? I wouldn't be here if I didn't. It's always good to know. I like seeing you like this, especially after it's been a few weeks, or even months. That either means you don't love me. Or this is all you want. So do you. Love is... just an arrangement, in which each of the parties get what they want. That is so unromantic. But it's true. Go back to Teresa, get elected president, and make love to me... whenever I ask you to. Is that a request? That's an order. Yes ma'am. Ma'am. Get out of here! I didn't ask you to get me anything. I didn't ask you to get me anything. What's that? Get out of here. Leave me alone. Get out. Look. I did it myself. It's pretty good. You could get a huge infection, María. My uncle Pedro sang that to me when I was a kid. Mi friend Uncle Pedro. He was so nice to me. Pedro Vasquez, the guy you assaulted? Yes. I bit his ear off. All the money they paid him for me, wasn't enough to get it sewed back on. Do you want to talk about that? Do I? I never closed my eyes. Not with the first guy. Or the second. Or the third. With none of them. They're all in here. Right in here. Their faces. Years later you disfigured Pedro and two other guys. The first one... and the third. They claimed they had never seen you. I guess they forgot me. None of the others remembered them. None of the others remembered them. But I did. I remembered everything. Gate. Inmate Zaide Luján, follow the red line, up to the door at the end and hurry up. I saw you on the news. You are the best-known whore in all of Mexico. They get all of you sooner or later. You'd better not go in there with this on. They'd cut your finger off to get it. This way. Come. Strip. My letters to the Human Rights Commission must go out today. The reports of the experts that reviewed Lorena's case. - Did you send them to the judge? - Yes, Mr. Burián is outside. Tell him I'm... Can I have a minute of your time? How can I help you? I'd like to make something clear, once and for all. Tell me I'm a son of a bitch and an idiot, go on. You are a son of a bitch and an idiot. There, that's that. We have to work together. Unfortunately. I already apologized. Why get our personal lives involved in our work? If I knew how to separate my personal life from my job, I wouldn't have gastritis, migraines or insomnia. Apart from my stupid remark, we got along quite well and you know it. What about Isabel? Have you spoken to her? I don't feel like it. You can't avoid her all your life. I could swallow my pride or tell her what I think of her, but I'm not supposed to lose control of myself. Take the afternoon off and let's talk about it. Yes Liliana? Put him through. How are you Alberto? I don't know anything about that. Santiago? Yes but why? Alright. I'll be here. Bad news? I hope not. You have a visitor. Come in. Good morning Colonel. I'm Ana Moreno, remember me? I was at the otherjail. Federico told me to come here and report to you directly. Nobody told me anything. That's weird. I thought he did. He said to report to work today. Hello. What are you up to Federico? There's a jailer here who says she now works here? Right, La Negra. I'm in charge of hiring our security staff. Then try her out and if things don't work out, we'll just send her back, but she's already hired. I am a good worker. You can check my record, after ten years of service at the other jail. I know Bambi. Federico says she's been difficult. I know her weaknesses, and I assure you she respects me. I am extremely strict with all the staff. No problem. Just tell me what to do. Report to Lieutenant Suárez. She'll tell you what to do. - Very well. - Go on then. That girl! We won! We won! We won! We won! Get out of here. I'll be right back. Negra darling! Cool it Bambi. What are you scared of? Don't worry. Who do you think brought you here? Things are exactly the same as over there. Come here. How do you like your new home? Did you bring any stuff with you? You'll have it as soon as I get the chance. Meet me at the visitors' toilet in a couple of hours. Say I sent you. Fine. Good. Welcome to Cacadocia. Alberto. You don't have time for your buddies anymore, just like at college. - Have a seat. - Thanks. I can't wait to see what it is. You won't like it. It's about Santiago. It's one of those tabloids rich old ladies love. It's called: "The Governor's Girlfriends." There are pictures of you of course. When were these taken? This weekend. I'm sorry, I just thought you should brace yourself for it. Santiago is a public figure, and possibly a presidential candidate. These things happen. Are you alright? Yes, yes, I'm fine. That's it. Thanks. - See you. - Bye. Am I to sleep here? What did you expect, honey? A suite with an ocean view? Take the top bed. The other one is taken. I need to talk to somebody. This can't be. Here, it's worth a fortune. Just take me to the director. I need to see her. Take it, it's yours. Were you together for a while? Just a while. Did it hurt? Sure it did. I know that face. Not much. Did you come? Really? So it's not that it feels great from the beginning. No. But it's great. He must know how. He's been with a lot of girls. He's a lot older than you are. I don't care, I want my first time to be with him. So what are you waiting for? You'll lose him. I'm preparing everything very carefully. I'm getting that nice two-piece we saw. Your call is being transferred to a mailbox. Leave your message after the tone. It would be nice of you to take my calls. I wanted to take you to a movie or dinner, you know, those dumb things couples do. Forget it. I just wanted to say hello. I put you on the list for tomorrow. You're coming, right? Zaide Luján, who was charged with white slavery, is now an inmate at the new private penitentiary. The Madame dealt mainly with young women from all over Central Europe. Her victims were enslaved and treated with the utmost brutality. That's a lie. They worked for me of their own free will, because they needed the money. The second sewing shift is now open. I'm sorry, ma'am, she says she needs to see you. I only brought her since you never say no. - Alright. Yes? - Can I see you alone? Sure. This way. Thanks. I'm sure you know who I am. Of course. I'll go straight to the point. How much is a private cell, away from the others? What? This is a private institution, in other words, a business like any other. I'll pay whatever you want to have my own cell. I fear for my life. I'm sorry but we don't sell privileges in here. Money can buy anything in here. I've sent lots of girls to the Villareal prison on the holidays. I have a lot of contacts out there. Many cabinet members are my personal friends so... I will pretend I didn't hear that. The cell you are in was assigned to you, where you'll be just as safe as the other inmates. Dominga. - Yes ma'am. - Thank you. We're blending the drugs tonight. You saw your husband with another woman. You were shocked. What did you do? How did you feel? I felt nothing. Mom. Mom. Why are you crying? It's nothing, honey. I'm fine. I'm always alright. I can deal with anything. I always move on. Even if the man you shared your life with betrayed you? You got out of the shower. Then I helped the girls get changed, and we went and celebrated my husband's victory. All night long I wondered if she was still there. Who she was. I couldn't remember anything specific about her, except that tattoo. Santiago was b beaming. Did you sleep with him that night? Sure, we were celebrating, weren't we? What did you discover? That he would never know how I felt. That his little victory would not affect me in any way. You are so full of rage. And that's not all. I have a 24-year-old lover. I run a broken prison. I write about and give lectures on ourjustice system, my two daughters can't stand me, and I haven't had an orgasm in ages. Didn't you have one with me? After 14 years of marriage, I slept with another man... you. You said so a few days ago and you were right. You were the instrument of my revenge. Was I really that corny? I don't remember the exact works, but I think that's what you meant. So did this help you at all? This isn't about me. We all have something to hide. I got you your favorite. You must've worked for the drug lords before you ended up in here. Did you take your kids with you? Or did their nanny look after them? I never had to work. You don't say. So what, you were in the fashion magazines? My thesis was about drugs that reverse the effect of cocaine and opiates. You think you're great, right? Hurry up. The cells close in 20 minutes. You heard her. Make it snappy. Let's go. She can stay and finish. Dad, did you get me those CDs? I haven't had any time, honey. You never think about us. I have been too busy to do anything else. What about your dinner? I'm not hungry. Ignore her. She always does that. Can you loan me some money? What for? To take her boyfriend out to dinner. Shut up stupid. Ignore her. She's always making up things. She keeps telling me how much she loves him and... What's going on? Nothing, dad. I told her I like a guy at school and she made the rest up. It's for a nice dress. Please, dad. Alright, as long as you stop acting like a spoilt brat. I promise. What's the matter? Stop acting like this. I wanted to talk with you. Teresa, I know I already told you, but I'd like you to give it some thought. I think we can save our family and our marriage. I still love you. "Santiago Marín and his girlfriends." That's the next issue. You have us working together. You have forced me to see her every day, without giving a damn how I feel. Let me explain. I don't want to hear it. Think about what you'll say to your daughters. You and your family values. Calm down and let me explain. That woman... That woman, Isabel Clavé, has been your lover since we lived together. Don't you dare deny it, because I swear... Alright, I admit that while we were still together, we had a relationship, but it was nothing important. I swear you are the only woman I care about. That's enough. Think about what you'll tell your daughters. I hope you're man enough to be truthful, and now get out, I can't stand the sight of you. I'm not going in there. You heard the director, so get in there. Hi there. I'm your neighbor. I'm glad you came. I was so lonely. Now I have someone to chat with. It's getting to you, isn't it? We all went through that the first few days or months. Some even take years to get accustomed. It feels like a blow to the stomach, or like you can't breath. I even got a rash the first time. Splash water on your face. That will help. That's a bad sign. Whenever Saico starts humming, she's in a bad mood, and you need to watch out. Aren't you going to tell me about it? There's nothing to tell. Get back in your cells. Get back in your cells. What are you and Bambi up to? She's dangerous, Lorena. If I were you... Don't tell me what to do, Magos, please. Your card. Miss. Poker. That's it. Just sign here please. Hello. Hi. I just wanted to thank you for our conversation earlier today. - Did it help? - It helped me a lot. Good night then. Who the hell are you smiling at? - She's a nice person. - Nice person my foot! Move over. Keep that crap up. Are you Barbie? Barbie's your goddamn mother. Bambi, idiot. I'm sorry. I was told you could help me. I need protection. I need a chopper to get out of this dump. Money is no object. Some of these women are out to get me, please. You name it and it's yours. Come in. I've been wanting to talk to you, but I haven't had the chance. What is it? I think we need to isolate the new inmate, Zaide. She tried to bribe you too for a private cell? No, and even if she did, you know me better than that. There are no privileges for sale in here. Some of them are out to get her for what she did to them or their kids. So do your job and keep an eye on them. That's not enough. What do you want Isabel? To turn this into a jail like all the others, where the rich buy privileges and comforts? You brag about your security system. So prove it. Have you got something against me? An issue of some sort? Should I? See you later. Are you taking your pills? I'm so concerned about you. Why did you do it, Carla? Because I was mad at you. You totally ignored me, Juan. All you did was work. It was like I didn't exist. I thought that if you felt you'd lose me, things would be like they used to. I was stupid. But please understand how hurt I was. You were hurt enough to fake a kidnapping, and get in the sack with that guy? I swear to God me made me do it. I love you Juan. Drop the charges. Drop them so we can be together again. Juan. Juan. Are you looking for anything special? She's getting ready for her first time. Shut up. You came to the right place, we have some really cool stuff, like these condoms, there are several flavors, but these are the coolest. Call me if you need me. - Try this on. - Shut up, that's awful. I like that. Do you have your high school uniform? - You're nuts. - Why not? Could you please lower the volume? Hello. - Hi honey. - Hi dad. After school... Where are you? - Here. - Where? At school. Come over after school today. I need to talk to you. Not today dad. I really can't today. Andrea, only the president says no to me. Could it be later, like this evening? Please dad. I'll pick you and your sister up at 8, and bring you over here. Alright. I don't deserve this. It's not fair to lock me up for what I do. You weren't charged with prostitution, but with trafficking and exploiting human beings. I exploited no one. The women are all grateful to me. You think it was for a good cause? I never thought I'd end up like this, without my things and all alone. Do you have any idea how irresistible you are doctor? Do anything you want. Anything at all. I know you're longing to make love to me here, now. Forget I'm your patient for a moment. Don't be such a hypocrite, doc. I want it too. Stop it. Get dressed. Get dressed. Guard. I'm done with this inmate. Your next session is tomorrow afternoon. I hope to see you then. Thank you so much for today, doc. I don't need any therapy. All I need is you. We made a deal. A short vacation. José Burián, don't be such a wet blanket. You told me to enjoy life when you were my therapist. Who needs shrinks anyway? Or therapy? Or any of that? Eugenia. Eugenia! Please, I can't take it anymore. I miss you. Talk to me please. Juan. I love you. I need to see Lorena Guerra. Mrs. Lagos wants to see you. Watch it. We appealed and there is a good chance that you'll be freed soon. Why are you trying so hard to help me? I have personal reasons to sympathize with your case. I've been there. I understand, believe me. I know you didn't kill her, but I would understand if you did. Patrick is the one I could have wanted to kill. He swore eternal love, faithfulness and all that crap. I understand. I don't want to get my hopes high again. You don't want me to withdraw the appeal, right? I don't want to go through that again, hearing a judge say I can't get out of here. Your chances are very good. Don't trust me so much. Maybe I'm not worth the trouble. This explains all the attitude. What are you doing here? I'm not involved with your husband. I hate lies. I can't deal with them. That is why I'm a lawyer, because I believe truth and justice go hand in hand. Your falsehood is an affront to my dignity. Nobody's faithful anymore. Thank you. And now, please excuse me, I'm very busy. What a bitch! Daniel, it's your mother. I think we should have dinner on Sunday. I haven't seen you in ages. You don't even phone us anymore. Lots of kisses. I hope to see you then. Bye. Coming. Hi. What are you doing here? I sneaked out to bring you a present. What's that? Come. What's that? That's edible underwear. This is to tickle each other. These are chocolate flavored. And phosphorescent condoms. You're crazy. We'd better stop this. What? You are too young. I'm almost 18, Daniel, and you're not exactly old. Your mom is my teacher. This isn't right. My mom? You remembered my mom just now? Are you for real? What does she have to do with this? She even screwed up the biggest moment of my life? You're such a jerk. I don't care. I don't know what to say. So mom is your teacher. Idiot. Find out what's going on. Now what have you done, you idiot? You damn cannibal! My God! I asked you to isolate Zaide, and now someone almost bit her ear off. It was your job to have her permanently guarded. Let's not get crazy here. You didn't let me do my job, just to get back at me for my relationship with Santiago. If you want my resignation, just say the word. But we can't go on like this. SUBPOENA. What is this? You lost the house to the casino over a bet? What were you thinking, you dumb bitch? Bastard. What have you done, you scumbag? You faggot. I saw all your filthy stuff. Everybody's going to hear about this. Get out of here. When I'm done with you, everybody will know about it. Your parents, your boss, everybody. You lost the house, you little faggot. Shut up, bitch! And it will be all over a magazine, that publishes all kinds of lies. Plus, you will even see some pictures, which are fakes. You mustn't pay much attention to what they say, or believe any of it. Will you please remember what I said? Yes dad. Those reporters made up all that rubbish. But I need you to be totally sure that the only woman in my life, the only wife I have, is your mother, although we're separated at the moment. Lovely. I'm sorry, I needed to talk with them. I see how upfront you're being with them. Yes, they had to know the truth. Don't apologize to her, dad. This is your home too, right? And you respect your kids, right? Don't make this any more difficult for me. Teresa makes everything more difficult. All she wants is to screw up our lives. That's enough Andrea. Go to your room, Ruth. I'll be right up. How much longer must I be the bad guy? When are you going to get real? Calm down, let's talk about it. No, I can't take it anymore. I'm giving up on everything. On you and Capadocia. So you're definitely leaving? Can I help you? No, I'm not thinking straight anymore. I need to get out of here before I slip up even more. - Allow me. - No, thank you.
