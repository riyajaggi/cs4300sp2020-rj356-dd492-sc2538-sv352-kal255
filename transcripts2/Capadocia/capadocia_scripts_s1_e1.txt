 16 HOURS BEFORE Anybody wants towels? Nobody? How about you? Please, could I have another one? I knew it. Two for you, then. What about you? I don't need one. If so, that would be a miracle. Here... I have your stuff. I hope you have the money. This is just one day's supply. You over there!

 It hurts, doesn't it? Put on a bandage to stop the milk flow. No, Margos, I'm not gonna do that. You mean... tonight? I know I promised you... I know. But I'm leaving in two days and I still have to pack. I haven't even started. - Mom, I need your brown boots. - I'm using them, Andrea. I have nothing to wear. That's weird, you haven't packed a thing. At least, pack your own bags. Hello... Yes, I can hear you. The pancakes are burning.

 Alright, see you later. No, I'm not being cold, I'm just in a hurry. Alright, bye. There's nothing here, mom. Listen, ladies... do you realize we're flying to Paris in two days? We're not going to Cuernavaca... but to Paris, France, Europe. Are you gonna get ready or what? I hate Paris, mom. Can't you get a PhD somewhere else? - The pancakes. - Oh, my! - Patrick! - Yes? Breakfast is ready. Where's my bunny? The bunny's outside, baby. One last spoonful. Isn't that yummy? One more. Tote is not invited for breakfast. A little more? Morning, honey. Hi. Look! Look at this little man. We've got to fix this hair. Yes... good pancake. Let me help you. Patrick, two or three for you? Just one. Very well. - Lorena. - Yes? I can't go with you guys to Teques today. How come? It's inventory time. Mom, can you cut this for me? - Yes, honey. - Let me help you. We should be done by Saturday, I'd get there on Sunday. We can wait for you. It's not necessary. The kids need some fresh air and sunlight by the pool, right? Do you agree? Don't feel sad. I'll make it up to you next weekend. OK. - OK? - Alright. Take your hands off me. - Stupid bastard. - Let's go. Stop pushing! If this asshole touches me again, I'll... You'll, what? You come to me as I request, Federico... and pick up the phone when I call you. The jail privatization bill is being discussed... at the House of Representatives. What have you done? - Well... - I want results. Son of a gun! - You owe me 50. - I'll pay you as soon as I can. OK. What's up? This is broken. Really? It's broken alright. Freaking Negra, we are hungry. Don't mess with me, bitch. Here. Thanks, Negra. What do you want? - You know what. - Show me the money. That's not enough. Bocinas, whatever you have will do. You look like hell. Wash up. Do you want me to brush your hair? Come on, it's all tangled up. I said no. You're so stubborn. May I? Come in, Bambi. Good morning. Are you letting Bocinas sell on her own? Of course not, Regina. Then... nail her. I got it. Regina knows you're drug dealing. - But you told me to... - To what? Nothing. Nothing. Stupid. Come on! Find something to do, you idiots. Our investors will take advantage... not only of the revenue of a five-star hotel... which is fully booked all year round... but also of a factory that uses 21st. century technology... with 19th. century labor conditions. No sick leave, no strikes, no unions... no benefits, with labor force guaranted. So this is something we can all benefit from. Especially Mexico, right? Yes, of course, this is what I mean. To make this happen, I need your parties to vote for this deal. We don't even need to talk about money... that has never been an issue. We've always agreed on the amount, right? Yes, by the way, man... those two bottles of brandy you sent me are awesome. Why should we care about their rights... and disregard the victims, Professor? Some are guilty of premeditated crimes... others are here for other reasons. You see that girl sitting at the table? Guillermina Camacho. She was being raped, defended herself, and ended up here. The girl with long dark hair is Fernanda Castrejon. She was a secretary, and did her job as she was trained to... she did exactly what her boss requested her... and signed a document that involved her in fraud. She got 22 years. - Did you bring my daughter? - This way. I'm her attorney. Sign here please. Carmen, are you sure you want your daughter to live here? She'll be better off here with me. I'm not saying they're all innocent victims... but many of the women who are in jail... ended up here because of some bureaucratic error... flaws in our legal system... or because they can't pay a 1,000-peso bond. Carmen? - Counselor. - I see you got your baby. - Thanks to you. - Sánchez. Give me only a minute, so that she can see my baby. She is so gorgeous. That's another cold blooded criminal. Carmen Sánchez was convicted of shoplifting. Guess what her crime was. She went to a supermarket... stole a carton of milk and a bag of diapers. They're disrespecting you, Regina... and neither of us can allow that to happen. If you don't get on your toes, I'll get on you. Warden, we had a fight with Bocinas... she was selling stuff all on her own. But Bambi took care of her. So who's going to take care of Bambi? Focus on your inner self, the rest will flow by itself. That's it... very good indeed. Do you like my drawing? Let go of me, bitch. Don't think I'm stupid, you asshole. Come on, apologize. You tried to fool me, didn't you? She is all yours. Stop it. That's enough. Get out of here now! Get out, you bitches! Take her to the doctor. Very well, this is our last class... so I'd like to give you something to think about... until you graduate from law school. It is a historical fact... that societies punish women harshly. We do not forgive our mothers, sisters or daughters... instead, we do forgive the males in our families. Societies place huge responsibility on women... something we never asked for. The world expect women to be submissive... selfless... women should deny their desires... because a man decided... that families are the structure of society... and women are the foundation of all families. If you take out the foundation, what happens to the structure? Questions? The twins will be up any time now. You should work for General Motors, Lorena... you're so well organized. I can't get anything done, I have no husband, no children. Please tell me you're frigid at least. So you've heard about it, Maite. Juli is back from school. Thanks. I'll be right back, alright? What did you learn today? Another song? What's that song? Did you behave well? Say hello to Maite. You have a message. Hello, honey! Nice kid! The message is from Patrick. Does he send messages to your cell phone? Have a look. Honey... You lucky girl. You and Patrick in bed are like the Cirque du Soleil. Watch what you say. Juli is here. Do you want to come to Teques with us? Patrick can't come. I'd love to, but you know Judge Cedeńo. I can't miss Sunday lunch. You know how my dad is. What a shame! - I'd really like to go. - I believe you. The new convoys are ready, Santiago. The new convoys are ready, Santiago. - What about the union? - No problem, we have a deal. Try to invite Arnulfo to the inauguration. - How are you, Governor? - Fine, thank you. - Hi. - How are you? Good. We're a little worried, you know... about what's going on... Hi, Santiago. And what about you? I was saying... Please come with me. I'm sorry to insist... but The House of Representatives is a concern. I am not rushing into things. Federico, I told you to focus on the humanitarian aspects. That was Teresa's advice to us. I followed her advice. The congressmen had a different opinion. They didn't pass the bill to privatize the jail system? There's nothing here. Who else is in the gang with Bambi? What about Saico? Leave her alone. What? You didn't see anything. Nothing happened here. Governor, if I could have just a moment alone with you... Don't you dare bribe me, please. Well, the penitentiary is ready. You could inaugurate it tomorrow, if you want. I am sorry, but that was our deal. Your deal was with the previous administration... not with mine. Why didn't you review Teresa's recommendations... before investing? We did, but businessmen are not Mother Teresa from Calcutta. Before we get into something, we evaluate the profits... that's the way it is. Well, your idea of profitability... is turning the inmates into slaves. Article 88 allows you, in emergencies, to veto any bill... that has passed any of the two houses. Well said... in emergencies, not at somebody's whim. The only way I would approve your project... is if Teresa works on it full time. I am not interested in that. I and the girls are moving to Paris in 2 days. See you later. Excuse me, Governor. Teresa, we need to talk. Please, we have discussed this a thousand times. Don't try to convince me that penitentiaries are labor camps. And I won't convince you to invest money in... How did you call them? Hippy havens? Your Utopia needs my money... and I need your Utopia to make money. Thank you, I'm not interested. Damn it! Hello. I need to see you now, Negra. We have a situation. Yes, sir, right away, no problem. Quiet down there! No, don't do that. Take care of your mom, OK? Are you coming with us? I'd love to, but I can't. I've got to work. See you later. Sit down. See you later. But I promise... we're taking vacation when you get back. - Let's go. - Without mom. You have frozen dinners, your shirts are ironed... and pay the gardener tomorrow, will you remember all that? Honey, I have to go now. I hope to survive without you for two days. - I hope so, honey. - I hope so, too. Quiet down, kids. Drive carefully. - I'll miss you so much. - I'll miss you too. Everybody ready? Here we go. Let's go. I don't know what to do. I've tried negotiating, bribing, threatening her. That's the problem, you just threaten her. Carry out your threats if you want results. She can be just as stubborn as me. No, please, there isn't room for two of you in town. Look who's talking. This is your fault too. Andrea is the one that's more like you. What does Ruth say? Does she hate Paris too? She doesn't care. She isn't as active as Andrea is here. Are you sure you don't want to work with ECSO? You've always dreamed of improving the jail system. - You said two minutes, damn it. - What's wrong? What's this? Why so much? Remember what we talked about? - Yes. - It has to be today. Today? I can't pull out a big operation in one day. Can you do it or not? - I can. - Very well. Today is your lucky day. This is a gift from heaven. Tonight, I am off. Do as you please, I'll turn a blind eye. When we get out of here... we'll look for your dad in The United States. In Cerritos, California, we'll get to see the sea... but we won't be able to swim, they say it's cold up there. But it's beautiful. People say the trees there are huge... they were born on the same day as the Lord Jesus. That's what is said. - Mommy! - What is it, dear? My Tote, my Tote, my Tote! - Where is your monkey, baby? - I left it at home. My Tote, my Tote, my Tote, my Tote! I hear you. All right! I hear you, I hear you. We'll go back for your Tote, honey. Consuelo, don't go... stay with me. Stay with me! Consuelo, don't leave me. It's show time! It's time to kill! Let's rock, everybody! I won't do this again, OK, honey? I won't be long. Stay right there. Keep an eye on your bothers, please. Tote, Tote, the things I do for you. Please, let me explain. Let go of me, for the kids' sake. What are you talking about? Let me go. How could you? How could you, Maite? Kill them all! No... don't touch her. My kids! Let go of me. Are you crazy? They'll see her! Let go of me. Lorena, they'll see her. Let go of me. You... stupid bastard! You... bastard. You're a big son of a gun. Whatever! What are you doing? Bambi's in charge. What do you say? Will you write me? Yes. I've always wondered... if what we had was more than just... If it meant the same to you as it meant to me. Goodbye. What's it gonna be, Bambi? Find the Colombian girl. Come on, let's go! You too. Let's go! Go ahead. Feds, this is Ana Moreno, from Femenil Oriente. There's a riot going on. I need full back up. I'm in charge until you get here. - Blondie Tello... - Yes... She says Alberto is pretty wild in bed. - Is that right? - Yeah. Oh, my, he's so boring, even passive. Don't make things up, Federico. For you, all pretty guys are gay. Really? Didn't I have sex with him during the Tennis Open? Is that true? Look, he's right there. Hi! How are you? I'm fine. - Long time I don't see you. - Yes, right? Have you met? How do you do? - How is everything? - Fine. Excuse me. What's up, Negra? Sir? All hell broke loose. Well done. But it's got out of hand now. I'll take over. Good evening, ma'am, may I speak with your newscast editor? I don't know how it happened... it was so sudden. She slipped down the stairs. I can't explain it. Where are you taking my mom? Get in the car, ma'am. I'll see you again. In the car. I love you so much. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Not in here, Colombian. Negra, where is the Colombian? You've gone too far, Bambi. Isn't that what you wanted? Where is she? You bitch. Run to the maternity cell! Damn it. Find her, Negra. God damn it! Get back, everybody, get back. Listen... Get this under control, I want a full report ASAP. Alright. Let's go! Check it out! On the floor! Get down now! Do as I say! Get down, right now! Who are you? Ana Moreno, head of security. Report? The leader of the riot is down the hall, to your left. She took four or five kids and a baby, as hostages. She's armed. Get your gun. We'd better ask for back up. Bambi. Stay put! Turn yourself in. The Feds are here. Calm down and do as I say. Come with me, the kids too, come on. Keep moving. Don't worry, you'll be fine. Good evening. Watch it, somebody's coming. Open that door. Be careful. Easy, easy. They're just a bunch of rats. Put it down, Bambi. She's eight months pregnant. Let the kids go. Keep on shooting and I will kill them all. Negra! She's got hostages. Turn yourself in or I'll make sure you get 20 more years. Twenty years would apply to you, for being corrupted. Come on... let's get out of here. One by one. Let's go... very carefully... slowly. Put your hands on the back of your neck. Easy, easy... one at a time. Very slowly, that's it. Slowly. Keep calm. Don't shoot. Is she down? Is this how you expect me to turn myself in, you bastards? Mr. Governor, this is the first riot ever in a women's penitenciary... any comments? Don't worry, we'll keep you updated. What is the report? It started at 8:30 p.m. There are several dead and wounded people... including two inmates. The SWAT team is doing their best. How many people are in there? There are 400 inmates and 50 guards. Any children? Yes, unfortunately. The leader is holding them as hostages. Let's negotiate, damn it. What is it that you want? First, show some respect, bitch. I want Cinderella's castle, I want Barbie's car. Are you gonna give them to me? Nobody's going to hurt you if you give yourself in. Yeah, right, how much is 50 plus 114 years I already have? - How much? - That's 164. Sure, I'll be right out. I want three things, listen to me. First... I did not plan this mess. Second, as of tomorrow... I want everything Regina had, including the Colombian. And third... I'm fed up of talking to you. Call Teresa Lagos, if you want the kids alive. Mom, your inmates are on the news... and your other daughter had all the milk. That's all. Adriana Pérez... you can make your statement now. - How old are you? - I'm 25. - Occupation? - Housewife. I just heard, Santiago. What are you doing here Teresa? I know them well. Maybe I could help. We can get to the hostages through the roof, do we go in? For the kids' sake, we have to move fast. Are you going to expose kids to the guns? There's a bloodbath in there. The SWAT team has to stop it. The gang leader wants to negotiate... but she'll only talk to Teresa Lagos. I'm ready. I'm here, Bambi, it's Teresa. If you come out in peace, I will intercede on your behalf. I don't want this to get any worse. I swear to you, by my daughters... I'll negotiate your immunity with the governor. We're going out there, slowly. One at a time, very slowly. No panic at all. One after the other... very well. Everybody... stay calm. Very quiet. The hostages are getting out. Awaiting for command. Do you copy? Action! Don't shoot. Get back! Put the gun down. Easy now. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. Good girl. - Right in there. - Thanks. Lorena. What did you tell them? Why did you say you pushed her? It was an accident. You said what they wanted to hear. You confessed. You confessed, Lorena. Now we have to say you were put under pressure... or you were drugged, or that I pushed her. But you can't be here. She was my best friend. After six hours of anguish and uncertainty... and once the minors were rushed to safety... the Secretary of National Security... authorized the SWAT team to enter the facility. The riot started approximately at 8:30. The riot is now under total control. The leaders have been apprehended. In your opinion, what caused the riot, Mr. Marín? Corruption... drugs, overpopulation... and lack of funding. How many inmates died? Eighteen. Since this is such a huge tragedy... isn't that a sarcastic answer? If you want, I could say nobody died... fire one of my agents... and then hope that sometime, in the future... a bigger tragedy takes place... to make us all forget what happened tonight. Facing all evidences, there is no room for lies. I will not lie to you. A very difficult decision faces me ahead. By the authority vested in me... under Article 88... having in mind the interest of public safety... I announce that a privately run penitentiary will be opened. Are you going to exploit the inmates? No. We're looking into agreements with the private sector... in order to guarantee the improvement... of the interns' living conditions. A group of private investors... will be in charge of running the facility... but supervised by two government representatives... Coronel Isabel Clavé... and the human rights specialist and criminologist... Mrs. Teresa Lagos, that's all, thank you. You have always been a human rights activist... is this your great moment? Just one more question, please. One more question. Santiago. How could you use me like that? You should have discussed it with me first. Is that a no? I have plans. Tomorrow I'm moving to Paris with your daughters. Alright. So you have plans. Then Capadocia opens with or without you. This is just one example of what happens when you think you're above the law. Nobody is above the law. We know who the leaders of the riot are. They'll spend 60 days in solitary confinement. Who wants to join them? Sit down all of you. Right now! Your punishment will be carried out in silence. Pee if you need to. Shit if you need to. But there's no food. Lorena Lucía Guerra Maciel... stated that she caught her husband... Patrick Lanz Cardozo, having sex with the deceased... Maite Cedeńo Garmendia... who was her neighbor and friend. That infidelity affected her seriously... she lost control of herself and started punching them. The now dead woman attacked her... Lorena defended herself... and Maite fell down the stairs... hitting her head and fracturing her skull. Therefore, Lorena Lucía Guerra Maciel... is hereby ordered to be detained... and formally charged with murder. She will be deprived of her freedom... until she is sentenced in a court of law.
