  subslikescript horizontal links top  
 
 
 Let me introduce you to your new cellmate, Bambi. Consuelo... Ospino. "The Colombian". With 18 women dead and dozens wounded... it is the first riot of this scale... to be seen in a women's prison. Welcome to the program. Thank you for having me, Veronica. What can you tell us about this huge number of casualties? Believe me, Veronica, like the rest of the country...

 we consider this riot a very sad event indeed. Indeed, but without a doubt... this tragedy also helped you open your new private jail. No, not really, it would've been inaugurated anyway. The fact of the matter is that this riot has again confirmed... the huge flaws of the Mexican jail system... flaws which we are certainly going to correct. The basic problem is the inmates' idleness. Taxpayers are tired of funding prisoners... who do their time as if it were a vacation. All International Human Rights Commissions have declared that big, well-know companies only exploit the inmates... with workdays in excess of 16 hours... at ridiculous wages.

 Those damn women. I'm sick of the bad publicity the riot got us... and fixing your screwup in public. We both agreed that the riot was a necessary evil. The riot was one thing... but all that bloodshed was quite another. The assembly plant is having second thoughts... about Capadocia... because of your incompetence. Do you realize the amount of dollars here? I think everybody's upset right now. We need to wait a few days until things cool down. All that matters is that Capadocia is opening. Not without an assembly plant. You have two days to find someone to hire the women. Two days, Federico. Listen up everybody. As of today... Bambi's little business... will sell you only 200 pesos worth of stuff per week. Anyone I catch dealing on her own will answer to me. Have I made myself clear? Bambi, I'll ask the spirits to protect you. Bambi, please, I need a fix right now. Please, I need it now. I'll pay you later. I've had enough of you. Shut up already. She's desperate. Charge her twice the regular price. Shut up. Rlease hear my prayer. We offer you our freedom in exchange for our safety. Do you know why I confronted Regina? Because of you. So you'd have a real woman to look after you. Wasn't it worth it? Colombia - 1980 - You can't come, dear. - What? - Why not? - She's too ugly. Hurry, they won't let you in if you're late. I'll wait here. Come in, this is your place too. Mom. El Góber Rrecioso is taking us to dinner at a great place. Do not call your dad Góber Rrecioso. Since we didn't go to Paris... dad's taking us out to dinner next Sunday. What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in school? I forgot my civics textbook... and my sports outfit. Hurry or you'll be late. I'd rather you didn't make Ruth think nothing's changed. We're not a family anymore, Santiago. That's because you don't want us to be. Rlease don't start that again. Nothing's going to change between us... so please don't use the girls to blackmail me. I assure you I didn't mean to. Are these the inmates going to the new jail? Yes and it's pretty tough to decide who gets to go... so I've chosen the ones who can be rehabilitated quickly. The non-violent, low-profile ones... to avoid any corruption or power struggles. That's good. Just remember that the judges will decide... who to send to Capadocia. Capadocia... like the city of the Amazons? That's how ECSO named the new jail. It doesn't sound bad. It's better than: "Private Run Women's Prison". Or even: "Government Approved Female Exploitation Center." I need your report, Teresa. They have to be transferred next week. Next week? ECSO hasn't even said what their jobs will be. There isn't a decent infirmary, much less a psychiatrist. We just have to do it, Teresa. I accepted the deadline and that's the way it has to be. You're letting them have their way with you. At this rate, Capadocia will be just another prison... the only difference is that on top of everything... they will be ECSO's slaves, great! Please calm down Teresa. I'm under a lot of pressure. Everybody's all over my back. Capadocia is opening and it has to function properly. Dad. Let's go, daddy. Bye, Mom. Come on. What's wrong? How are you feeling? What the hell did Bambi sell you now? Come here. Let me check... I think you have a fever. You need to quit that crap. It's killing you. What do you care? Get the hell out of here! Get your filthy stuff out of here. Calm down, it's not my fault Teresa got my sentence reduced. To hell with Teresa! To hell with the judge! To hell with everybody! Get the hell out of here. You're not the one that has to rot in here. Stop it, stop it. Please don't go. Don't go. I'll try to help you. Liar. You won't give a damn about me once you get out. They'll let you out too, and we'll be together again. Why would I want to be on the streets again? Listen, listen. Please don't go. Please, please, please, don't go, don't go. Okay, you dykes. Your honeymoon's over. - That's it, get up. - No, please. - Move it. - No, please. Stop it. That's enough. Let go. Stop it. No, please come back! Can we talk? No, there's nowhere to talk in my house. Wait until I get to the office. It can't wait, the company didn't sign the Capadocia deal. Why should I care? You know Lina, one of the owners. Help me convince her. I didn't know Lina was interested. Yes, she is. Plus, just think about it. It's the perfect job for the inmates. It's clean, easy work... like those occupational therapy workshops you like so much. Why should I bail you out? What else do you need at Capadocia? I need decent medical attention... including a psychiatrist to start working right away... and a rehab center to treat their addictions. Take my hand, go on. You're going to school, come on. We're going to school. Take each other's hands, please. Hold hands, Juli. Hold hands, Juli, come on. I'm sorry, Patrick, your kids can't go inside. - Why not? - Why not? Why not? What's the problem? Because... the other parents are concerned about what happened. Please, the kids had nothing to do with it. Please, Patrick. Come in, everybody. Rlease close the door. What's wrong? Come here, Juli. Come here. Take your brother's hand. Come on, we're going home. I want to sit all by myself next to the window. Some other time, baby. Come here, Juli. I want to sit by the window. By the window. So you're leaving us. You're free as a birdie, aren't you? - So what? - Move it. Nobody moves a finger in here without permission. And don't you forget it. Welcome. Get over there. Lorena Lucía Guerra Maciel. Well, well. Homicide. Why did you just kill her? Why not your husband? I know the feeling. You should've gotten a medal. Strip. Where? Right there. Take it all off. If I may say so... If I may say so... you're letting the tabloids get to you. You think so? But of course. How much do you pay a worker per hour, 50 pesos? More or less. The inmates would cost you less than half of that... with no social security payments, pension funds... accident and disability insurance to worry about. Really. Just think of the possibilities... imagine all those inmates working for us. American private jails are stock exchange listed. Did you know that? Don't insist, Federico, I already told you. There's no way I'm letting them touch my clothes... much less after that riot. What if I proved that most of them are victims... not psychos, like the media claim? Teresa. - How are you, Lina? - I'm fine. - Sorry I'm late. - No problem. I guess Federico has told you about all the economic benefits. Yes, he has. Then I'd like to talk to you about the humane side of it. Why don't you come with me and see for yourself? Get in. Shut up you animals. Calm down you animals, calm down. Not here. Further down. Let me have her. Looks like you've never seen a woman before. Your suite, madam. Settle down. Welcome home. That attorney lady is coming over with a visitor. Get them busy and fast. The inmates can't be idle. Move it, everybody. Get upstairs to the workshop. Move it, move it. Get out, get out. Form two lines. You too. Come on, move it, get against the wall. Get against the wall. Behave yourselves. We've got company today. We're going to the workshop. Come on, move it. You too, Amy. Get in line, quick. Go, go, go. Don't get any ideas about that stuck up bitch. What do you mean? I'm looking at everybody. You're nuts, baby. And don't drag your feet. I'm watching you. - You too, Colombian. - Coming. MAGDALENA RIVER. COLOMBIA, 1986. Ricardo's here to fetch the girl. Come here, Consuelo. I haven't been crowned, dad. Come with me. God bless you. Calm down, nobody's going to hurt you. Sheer desperation and poverty got most of them in here... either that, or an ugly twist of fate. If I ever happened to be in their shoes... I would want someone to give me a second chance. I won't let you down. I promise. And your image is safe. I have quite a few good ideas. I hope so. I think you did it. When can we expect some more stuff? I don't know what you mean. Don't worry about it. Nobody knows a thing in here. But they get all worked up without their medication. What's in here? The art studio. Would you like to see it? Sure. She is gorgeous. Consuelo Ospino. She was convicted on drug related charges. She's better looking than my models. THE MAGDALENA RIVER BANK COLOMBIA 1992 Consuelo. How are you, my child? You don't need to ask her that. Can't you see how lovely she is? What about a kiss? You bastard. Why did you bring me to this hick town? To see those geezers? I thought you would like to see your parents. I want to see them alright, but six feet under. Goddamn it! I am such an idiot. Let's get going to Cartagena. This is the first group we're transferring to Capadocia. Is 2:30 alright? We took care of the logistics. They leave on Monday, at 3 p.m. Do the inmates know that? On Monday, they'll know who's leaving and who's not. They have the right to know, to prepare themselves. I'm in charge of the transfer and security is my priority. I know these women very well. The longer you take to tell them, the stronger their reaction will be. That's all. I didn't know they're sending new inmates. It's just her, she killed Judge Cedeńo's daughter. It's the same old story. The wife catches the husband cheating and... I know. I'd like her file. I can send it over... but there isn't much you can do for her. There's Teresa. When can we have visitors again? When can we watch TV? You can't punish all of us for what a few did. Are you taking some of us to another jail like the jailers say? - What jail? - Who's going where? Be quiet or line up. All I can tell you now... is that we're trying to make things better for everybody. You have my word on that. - We've heard that before. - Liar. That's enough. One line. I said one line and shut up. Move it. You'll need sunblock to stand in the sun for six hours again. - You're such a bitch. - Cool it. Why haven't you come to see me? Get rid of the gum or I'll stick it where you like it. Hi, there. How do you like your new home? You've stirred up the henhouse, haven't you? The girls say you're hot... but let's see how long... that cute face of yours lasts in here. Give me those earrings. Now. Move it. Hurry up, down here where nobody can see them. Who said you could go? You need permission for everything in here. Leave her alone, Bambi. Why should I? Because I like her. She's a nice girl, right? Plus we're friends. Go on, my child. Tell her you'll be good and you won't ever mess with her. Right. I'm only doing this because I like you. Just remember I did it for her. Let's see what happens next time. It's alright, girl. - I need to talk to you. - What about? What do you mean what about? Where's that guy that brings us our stuff? Nobody's getting anything until the new jail opens. - Come on. - Are we being transferred? We're not going anywhere. I know that. It's just that this place gives me the creeps. I keep remembering Regina. What's there to remember? Let her out. Go to the rest area. That ought to help you forget the bitch. Remember my foot! I want to have the list today, Negra. Thanks. I'm not in the mood, Carlos. Are you still mad at me? Who says I'm mad at you? I just don't feel like it. What's that? Your present, Consuelo. Maybe that'll cheer you up. We got rid of those idiots. They're dead and gone... just like you wanted. I'm working on this new line with some finer details. I think we could start with this. And of course... nobody needs to know the inmates did it. I think it's quite the opposite. Everyone should know the inmates made your outfits... and how altruistic you really are. It's a huge campaign with network and radio coverage. Teresa could help you... with a speech about the women's social adaptation. One more thing, Lina. It doesn't have to be this one, but how about this logo? I like it. Listen up, everybody. These are the names of some of you... who are going to be transferred to Capadocia. Line up here in the hall, right away. Fernanda Castrejón. Alejandra Vega. Cristina Cobos. Ana Diaz. Yolanda Torres. Amy Robinson. Carmen Fernandez. Guillermina Camacho. Dolores Sanchez. Oh Angel of Death, protect us. Margarita Rueda. Protect us today. You can't take that. I can't leave my offerings to the Angel of Death. Alright, take it with you, but don't say I let you. When I first got here, I didn't think I'd last a week... and it's been 18 years now. And here I am. Take care of yourself. You'll be fine. Move it, to the patio. Teté, the attorney, must like you. She put you among the chosen ones real fast. Don't bawl. Get your things. Claudia Pérez. Daniela Martínez. Consuelo Ospino. - What have you done? - Nothing. I swear I did nothing, Bambi. I did nothing, I swear. Who did you sleep with, bitch? Get up, get up. Who did you sleep with? Who, who? - Nobody. - Who? - Answer me. - Nobody. - Don't lie to me. - Nobody. Let go. Let go! Calm down. I'm going to cut you. You won't be so pretty over there. I'll cut your breasts too, you silly bitch. You won't be so pretty over there, idiot. You hear me? You bitch! Shut up. Shut up. Calm down. Calm down I said. Move it ladies. Form two lines. Take the door to the right. Move it. Move it. That way, that way. Move it. All the way down. Move it. Move it, move it. This way. Move it, move it. Move it. That way. Stop sniffling, Colombian. Move it. Move it. Move it, Colombian. I hadn't seen a dog in eighteen years. Consuelo Ospino. Well if it isn't the famous May Queen. Seeing the sights here in Mexico? Show me your badge. I'm with the DEA. In exchange I want my green card. First let me see what I'm buying. God, these gringos don't trust anyone anymore. That's the drop-off. Tonight at 7 p.m. Okay. Carlos Alcántara will be there? Yes, he always takes care of the big shipments. How can I be sure... that you are really willing... to betray your lover? Let's see. Killing my parents... isn't that a good reason? Pick me up at 7 p.m. at the Hotel Reforma, okay? You're staying here... until I confirm what you said is true. Governor. Governor, please. Governor, what can you tell us about Capadocia? When can we see the new prison? There'll be a special presentation for you in a few days. Would you care to comment the naming of your ex wife... as director of the new prison? Would you call that nepotism? Governor, do you think Capadocia will give back the inmates their dignity? Of course. You will have all the information you need in due time. Mr. Governor, please answer the question. Please answer the question. Please don't avoid the question. Straight ahead, to your left, right now. One line, please. Move it, move it. All of you, one line only, to your left. Welcome to Capadocia. Move it, move it. Move it. Move it. Faster, faster. Move it, faster, faster. Move it, move it, move it. Quit straggling, move it. Move it, move it, move it. Move it. You. Name. IName! What's going on? What are you stopping me for? Nothing's happening. Move it, move it. Move it, move it. What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. Move it. Move it, move it. Nothing's wrong. Move it. Move it, move it, move it. Sign. Sign. Does it hurt? Does it hurt? Move quickly, please. Come on, let's go. Move it, move it. Follow the red line. Halt. Everybody get closer. That's far enough. Welcome to Capadocia. You get one shot at this and that's it. We've got a lot of work to do together. Take them to their cells. Your cell numbers are in your transfer cards. Six feet in front of your cells. Six feet in front of your cells. Your cell numbers are in your transfer cards. Six feet in front of your cells. One whistle means pay attention. Two whistles mean I want you lined up in front of your cells. Be at the showers by 6 a.m. Breakfast is at 7 a.m. Lunch is at 2 p.m. Dinner is at 8 p.m. Make sure you're back in your cells by 8:30 p.m. Take her to the infirmary right away. Get in your cells. Get in your cells. Every square inch of the prison is monitored. The alarms in any given area emit different frequencies... to ensure the prompt arrival of the right staff members. This is truly impressive, Federico. It is, isn't it? Very impressive indeed. As you can see... rioting in here is practically impossible. How are Isabel and Teresa getting along? Let's just say they're doing their best. I'd like you to help me out with that. I want both of them in Capadocia. You can count on it, and thank you. I need to see Teresa. I can take you there. No, no, just tell me how to get there. Go this way. Her office is down there. Thanks. Isabel seems to be doing okay, right? Yes, but don't forget... she put their lives at risk during the riot. Isabel says things didn't get out of hand. Sure, for Colonel Isabel Clavé, things don't get out of hand unless somebody gets killed. You're exaggerating, Teresa. Yes, sure, that's all I ever do... but if that's how she plans to run Capadocia... I'd be really scared. Don't worry. I promise to have a word with her. Thanks for taking the job. I didn't have a choice, did I? Thanks anyway... for everything you've done for me. No problem. May I? Come in. What are they doing to her? Those are withdrawal symptoms. No drugs are allowed in here. What is she up to? Stupid bitch. Nobody out there can ever know about this. Damn it! What's wrong? Marta Trejo slit her wrists. How could you bring a junkie in here, Teresa? She is just one of many, Federico, in case you don't know... quite a few inmates get addicted... to the junk sold here, in prison. How could that be? We've got a suicide attempt on the very first day. That's because nobody cares about these women. Where is the psychiatrist you promised me? And the detox programs? I'm working on it. You're working on it? No, Federico. I didn't mean tomorrow or in six months. We said two weeks ago. You got yourself into this didn't you? Well this is it, suicide attempts, desperation... fights to the death over a pack of cigarettes. This is the only place where a pack of bastards can get away with exploiting their misery. Is this the way you think? Be aware that you are responsible for this place. - How is she doing? - She needs blood urgently. Take her to the hospital. I need a psychiatrist to see her tomorrow without fail. When is mom coming home? Soon, Juli. Soon. What's up? Do you know any shrinks? What is this? Somebody's here to see you. Right there. Talk to her. What? What do you mean what? Thanks to you I'm stuck in this hellhole. Take me to Capadocia or I'm blowing the whistle on you. What's with this idiot? She's got us by the shorthairs. She told her attorney everything... and now she's threatening to tell Teresa Lagos. Listen, lady... I can't do what you want. Don't give me that crap. Find a way to do it. We could work out something else though. I do not negotiate with sellouts. Take me to Capadocia or you're done. I need time. That's better. Don't even think of whacking me in here. My friends out there know all about you. Anything you do to me will cost you real bad. Jerk. Yes, Isabel? When did they bring her in? Alright. How is she? Very well. I'm on my way. Lorena Guerra has a visitor. Lorena Guerra has a visitor. Lorena. Was Juli on the school event? Yes. Are they eating properly? Yes. Are they with my parents? I've hired another lawyer, Lorena. We'll get you out of here soon. There are certain mitigating factors... and if that doesn't work, we'll just bribe them. Don't worry about it, I'm getting you out of here. I swear to God I'll get you out of here. Haven't you done enough already? Haven't you done enough already? Don't come back here. Get off of me. Here's the psychiatrist you asked for. Allow me to introduce you. Mrs. Teresa Lagos is our director. Colonel Isabel Clavé is in charge of security. - How do you do? - Hello. Dr. José Burian. Yes, I've read your work. I need Marta's file before seeing her again. Come with me to my office. I'll give you her file plus the PIN you'll need. Come with me. Welcome and thanks again for taking the job. You're welcome. Excuse me. What's the matter? You don't look too convinced. Don't you like him? I think he's the best there is. - No tortillas? - Move it. What is this stuff? This is airline food. You can always starve, if you don't like it. Shut up. Do you have any kids? Then eat for your kids' sake, child. Your husband's a nice guy. He's not my husband anymore. We separated two years ago. He's nicer than the guy I saw doing those press conferences. Why are you doing this? I didn't want to at first... working for ECSO is like selling your soul... but the pay is good. Why didn't you approach me at the law school? Is there a problem? I need to know if you don't want to work with me. Not at all. I welcome you to Capadocia. I can't do it. I just can't. You have to try, child. Constipation is bad for you. We all went through the same thing. Turn around. It's embarrassing. Mind your own business, Yolanda. Sensitive bitch. Okay, as long as you promise not to laugh at me... when it's my turn. Shut up, I can't sleep. Want some? In Spanish. I don't speak English. You have nothing to worry about. We'll take care of everything, everything. - Are you sure? - We'll take care of Carlos. This is so good. MEXICO CITY, 1999 Hi, Roberto. Long time don't see, my friend. I haven't heard from you in ages. I was up in the sierra. That's top quality. I have something you'll like. Have a seat. I haven't seen tequila this good in Cali lately. I have something you'll like even better. IPolice! iFreeze! IBastard! You're really good at this. No wonder you moved up the ladder so fast. See you there. Congratulations, baby. You're a widow, a widow. What's the rush? You said I could go when it was over. No, I said I'd do what I could. What do you mean? The Attorney General... refuses to grant you immunity. You're grounded in Mexico. Son of a gun! After being tried and convicted in a court of law... the defendant is to be incarcerated... for possession and traffic of illegal drugs... and for introducing them into the country. Consuelo Ospino is hereby sentenced... to 15 years in prison. LIGHTS. Where does this go? That goes in the corner. Put it there too. All I wanted... was a little cellphone. My boss asked me to sign some papers. So I signed them. I just wanted my baby to be quiet. I want to share my optimism with you today. Our project will be so meaningful and significant to you. Take full advantage of all these new benefits. They were developed for your total rehabilitation. I have very good news for you. Soon you'll be able to see your relatives... have your conjugal visits... and your sentences will also be reduced. A new venture will soon be implemented... which is all about you ladies. There will be new jobs available to you... for which you will be compensated. I just wanted to be a beauty queen. "I want my Tote. I want my Tote. I want my Tote. I want my Tote. My Tote. My Tote. My Tote." Juli wanted me to pick up his Tote. Thanks. How are you doing? Be careful with these pins, don't swallow them. Is everything okay? That's very good. You're doing great. Access will be restricted. No one can approach the inmates for security purposes. Even so, I'm not too sure this is the best way to present Capadocia to the media. Me neither, but of one thing I am sure. Nobody will remember the riot in the old prison ever happened. Mom, they cut off the phone since you didn't pay the bill... and Marcela is spending the night. Hello. What fashion show? Hi, counselor. Isn't this a teaser? Opening Capadocia with fashion shows... which are so agonizing for women? Thanks to that whiz kid over there. This is Judge Cedeńo, he would like to meet you. How do you do counselor. I heard my daughter's killer is among your protégées. They are not my protégées... just inmates who can be rehabilitated. Can we talk? What's wrong? You are violating every rule of the prison system... even the most basic security measures... but above all, the inmates' rights. You have no idea what a great... You have 30 minutes to stop your little bash. I heard there was a jail around here. Have you seen one? Julian, I'm not in the mood for your wisecracks. We'll talk later. My dear friend. Isn't this awesome? A bit too awesome if you ask me. Teresa. Teresa. - What's going on? - She is mine tonight.
