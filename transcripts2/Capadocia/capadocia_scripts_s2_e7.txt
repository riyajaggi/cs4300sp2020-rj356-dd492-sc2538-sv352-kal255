 LORD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME? Your mail, ma'am. - Thanks. - Sure. "I haven't forgotten. It was a Monday". Hi, this is Andrés Soto. It's a nice day, so I'm taking some pictures. Leave a message. I haven't forgotten either. It was a Monday, a year ago. How are we going to celebrate? Call me. I'm open to suggestions.

 Kisses, my love. These balls are even older than me. Can you believe they were at the other jail? They're all banged up, Magos. Like everything else in here. Don't get sad on me. I'm in a bad mood. Christmas in jail is just pretending to be happy. Hey, are you okay? Are you okay? Yes. I've got stomach cramps. The food is worse every day. I'll take you to the infirmary. I'm fine. Keep working girls.

 - You're okay? - Yes. It hurts a lot. Come with me. Go with her. Keep working. It'll be really nice. Lorena. Let's go. Where to? Just come, don't ask. Gate! Don't put them all up. Leave some for your mom to hang up tonight. Hey. Don't the lights go in first? - Ruth. - Go get them. You were in a hurry to hang the balls up. You didn't say a thing. What do I know? That's not my job. The first cheesy thing we do, and it turns out bad. - Not bad, in a hurry. - Bad. You'll be okay, baby. I was just careless. Daddy's stupid carelessness. But you'll be okay. I promise. You'll be okay. You'll see. Wake up to see Tote. I brought him over to keep you company, to hug you. I'll take care of your transactions. I need a list of new clients, and here are the transfers the boss wants. - Adriana. - Yes? I have a problem with the Acervex account. I need to change the zip code. - To transfer money? - No, just change the zip code. You've been here for years. That's so easy. Type in your PIN number, and... that's it. Good. How about lunch, Adriana? - Lunch? - Yes. Thank you, Aaron, but I have a lot of transferences to do. Seven million, four banks, 25 clients. That takes a lot of time. It's the suppliers' checks. I can barely handle my three accounts. - It's just a matter of practicing. - No, it's a matter of knowhow. I can't argue with that. Don't forget that when you're the boss. I won't. See you. You startled me. No wonder. You're late again. What can I tell you? Don't tell me anything. The boss is the one that could ask for you. What did you tell him? Did you cover for me? Not this time, but I can't lie to him whenever he asks where you are. It's been 3 times this week. I'm running out of excuses. I'm sorry I got you involved in my problems. No problem, but tell me, what was it this time? My fights with Inaki are worse than ever. It's awful. We might get separated. Two years, girlfriend. Two years down the drain. What happened to him? Did he fail and hurt himself? Nothing like that, Lorena, it's just that Juli was at home, with his dad and... And Patrick is really losing it, Lorena. He's doing things I don't know how to tell you. Yes, yes, he's losing it, and... Carmen. Are you there? So you're my wife's informer. Calm down, Patrick. I can explain. I was just talking about the kids. What do you tell her? When I use the bathroom? What time I eat? What? What? The mistakes I make? Is that it? I had to tell Lorena because you'd never dare to tell her Juli is sick, and that's not fair. Get lost, Carmen. I'm not leaving the kids with you. - Get lost. - I'm not leaving the kids. Yes, I understand. Yes. Thank you. What's the matter with my son? He's intoxicated. Intoxicated with what? With cocaine. Look, it's La Negra. It's La Negra. Here's a little Christmas present. Behave, girls. Go decorate the tree, Negra. I'm dreaming of a black Christmas Get back to work! Get back to work all of you! What's wrong, Negrita? Smile. Welcome, Negra. Give us a smile. These bitches are dying to get their hands on you. Are you going to let them? There's one of them. Smash her face in. You heard her, Negrita. Get to work. Hang this little ball on the tree. Smash her face in. What's your problem? Nothing, that bitch Negra jumped on me. What are you doing? Let her go! Stay away! Where are you? Come in here! I can't be in Capadocia. I can't! - Where are you taking her? - To see her kid, he's very sick. Her kid? How sick? Very sick, and I can authorize an inmate to see her kid. Any problem? Mrs. Lagos! La Negra! Ana Moreno! She's making trouble. Does the new head of security know? She tied her up. Take her to the van, and wait there. - Security. Security. - Move it. Lt. Juarez, to the observation tower. Shut up! Shut up! Do we proceed, ma'am? No. Put your guns away! Put them away! She jumped on me. Get me transferred. I can't be in Capadocia. I can't! You know what to expect if you keep this up. Negra for gay queen Negra for gay queen Get me out of here now or she fries right here. I'm not negotiating with you, so don't make matters worse. Don't make matters worse? What does that even mean? I'm no inmate. Look at me. I am a chief of security. I didn't kill my husband either His body was next to me when I woke up. Now I grieve for him while these idiots try to kill me. It's called karma, Negra. What goes around comes around. Negra for gay queen Let her go! Negra for gay queen Negra for gay queen Drop it. Drop it. Drop it, Ana. Don't do it. Don't do it! - Don't do it Negra. - Stop. Stop! Ana. Ana. Negra, talk to me. - To your cells. - Take her to the infirmary. Shit! - I can go with Lorena. - Thanks. What is it? It's a blackberry. Covered... with marmalade. - What kind? - Bitter orange marmalade. - You're cheating. - No. Yes you are. You're jealous my taste buds are smarter than yours. You think so? Let's see how good. Let's see. What's this? Well? What is it? It's a tough one. Hold on. Hold on. Let me think. It's... It's a blend of lips. Some tongue and... an intoxicating beverage. Yes? What intoxicating beverage? I need another taste. - You do? - Come here. One more to go. No cheating. Promise not to peek. What is it? What're you doing, Andrés? What are you doing? Can this be a little more serious? Counselor, doesn't my husband pay you enough to get me out? I admit we've done very little legally, but I need you to listen carefully, Monse. Remember Grandma Maria? Sure I do. Is she sick or what? Would you like to spend Christmas with her? Why do you ask? Because you could. I have to go now, but here are these sweets. Your favorites, from your husband. He says it's very important to have them today. He said that? Yes, he said that. To have them today without fail. Carmen. How is he? What did the doctor say? - He's okay. - He's okay? - Yes. - And the twins? At my sister's. He's okay. Please calm down. What room? Room 2004. It'll cheer him up to see you. - Where do I sign? - Thank you. Be careful with Patrick. Lorena. Listen to me, please. I'm his attorney. - Go to hell. - You can't go in there. - Let go. - Stop. You know better than laying a hand on her. - Let go. - Follow her. You're a jailer, right? I'm much more than that. Take a risk and find out? You'll be okay honey. You've only got a few minutes. How old is he? Seven? I have a seven-year-old. Once he fell from a second floor. I thought he'd broken every bone in his body. The doctor at the hospital said not to worry, that they're made of rubber at that age. I felt like hitting the doctor. And myself for being so careless. But he was okay. The doctor was right after all. At that age they're like rubber. We're the delicate ones. We're the ones that suffer because we love them so much. You have 20 minutes. - These match with the dress. - Lovely, and the others? - This way please. - Okay. This fabric is Spanish. It's gorgeous. I'll take the other one. I made an appointment. See you. - Fine. - See you. So long. Hi honey. Where's the dress? - It's bad luck. - Just a peek. - No way. - How did it go? No, I told you it's bad luck. Come. I told Eloy I'll pay him. Put that away. One week. Not a day more. Are you okay? End of shift. End of shift. Hi. Hi. Can I have one? Hop on. What's wrong? Nothing, I thought lawyers had other things to do, not just carry sweets around. Maybe it's not his fault. Lawyers sometimes have to wait. Courts move slowly. Maybe Nuro knows he can't keep his promise, so he's sending his girl sweets to keep her happy, and not think about getting out. Yeah, right. When we're as old as Magos. That's the only way we can be friends. It's different out there. How come? Andrea, please. The warden's daughter and the drug lord's wife? Best friends? How does that sound? I don't care whose wife you are or whose kid I am. We're friends forever, okay? - Grandma. - Baby. It's so nice to see you. I'm so happy to see you. My child. How are you sir? Thank God for bringing you home safely. - I got your Christmas present. - Really? We're bringing Monse over here. Really? But she's a little ill, and needs a room to rest. Right away. You boys must be starving. It's all ready, son. Let's have something to eat, boys. Come. How'd it go? I couldn't tell her a lot. There're cameras everywhere. Plus a guard just to keep an eye on us. - Bastards. The dogs. - Right. But they're screwed, I'm not showing up. Chalo will tell you what we plan to do, and you tell us if there's any legal issue. No problem. Come with me. Boys, get some beers. Baby Jesus. Thy will be done. Hear my prayer and let Monse come back, and let there be peace in my house. I know how tough it is, but all the prisoners have problems. Maybe you need to talk. Let's talk about your husband. You say you didn't kill him. How could I kill someone like Benjamin? He was the only good thing life ever gave me. I shouldn't have given my heart to that guy. He was the wrong guy. I shouldn't have given it to someone as good as him. Who could kill someone like that? Anybody, ma'am. People like Benjamin get blown away by the kind of people the world is full of. Who protected you while you were in charge? You want names? Demons. Bastard. I'll kill you. I will kill you! Your violence caused all of this. Let go. I'll show you violence. You're totally nuts, and you judge me? Forgot something, officer? Yes, I forgot to ask you how such a little kid got so high while his dad was with him. Unless his dad is the one that was high. And didn't know what was going on. Or didn't mind doing drugs in front of a kid. I only hope that dad has the guts to stay away from the kids he can't deal with. She's coming with me. What? I can't believe you threatened to kill him. I have nothing to lose. You reminded me I'm in jail. I uncuffed you so you could hold your kid. You didn't have to threaten him. He can use it against you. Can't you figure out your priorities? Or control yourself even when your kid is sick? I'd kill Patrick in a heartbeat. It's in me. You said so yourself. I can't control it. My kid doesn't deserve this. The doctor says he could be addicted. You can get your kid back. But not with threats, through legal channels. Understood? There's a blacklist of undesirables. Gambling addicts the casinos won't let in. You know who lists them? The addicts themselves. I gave them my name. I begged them not to let me gamble. And they did, they kicked me out of all the casinos in Madrid. I thought I had left all that behind. I have no idea how they found me. How much is your debt? 200 thousand Euros. Forgive me. For what? Please. For not saying anything. For thinking I could sweep all the dust under the rug. We'll get a loan. With what? I'm broke. What could I get for my beat-up old car? 50,000 pesos? I'll leave the country. No, Andres. There must be another way. There's no other way. There's no talking with them. You saw what they did. I won't forgive myself if you got hurt. I'll apply for a loan. I've worked for them for years. I handle huge accounts. I'm always there if they need me. Adriana. They won't lend you 200,000 Euros just like that. And I won't let you get in debt for me. I have to do something. I can't just sit here and watch what's going on. You can do something. Yes you can. I need you to do two things. First, forgive me. Please. And secondly, don't take the ring off. So I won't feel I've lost you when I'm far away. Promise? Yes. We did it! One! Two! Three! Girl. You're nuts. How could you Taser yourself? Gate. Return to your cells. Return to your cells. - I think that's good enough. - The star's missing. - Here's the star. - How will we get it up there? - Hold me very firmly. - Okay. I'll fall on the tree if you let go. And ruin everything. What's wrong Monse? What's wrong? Andrea, help me. I don't know what's wrong. What's wrong girl? Help! I don't know what's wrong with the girls. Security. Security. A doctor! We need a doctor. Andrea. Monse. What's the matter? I'm sorry I asked you to come on such short notice, but now I'm the one that needs a shoulder to cry on. No need to apologize. What's wrong? I... Well... There's someone. For a year now. A guy? Yes, a guy. Who else? You're a sly one. Why didn't you tell me? That doesn't matter anymore, you see... We broke up anyway and I feel awful. So where do I come in? It doesn't matter. Who is he? What's his name? Remember we went salsa dancing about a year ago? Andrés. Andrés Soto. I don't remember him. Never mind. If you want to be secretive and mysterious about it, fine, but I'll give you some advice that might help you. If you love him, fight for him. Don't let anything get between you two. How has this girl been doing? It's okay. It's okay. Magos says they had these last night. Who the hell brought them? Monse's attorney gave them to her. Pump their stomachs now, and send them to a hospital. Nuro. Nuro's expecting me. Get me out of here. Nuro! Wait for me. You'll pay the 200,000 Euros, and we'll take 300 more somewhere nobody knows us. What's going on, Monica? Two inmates are seriously ill and in the infirmary. We informed Logistics we're taking them to hospital. Who? Monse and Andrea got sick from these sweets Monse's lawyer brought her. Back to your cells! Move it. What new crap is this? You too Lorena. Hello. Where were you? - I got lost. - Lost? I'll be right back. Hi. All work and no fun? I'll be done in a second. Can you do me a favor? - Sure. - Can you get me a drink? - Sure. - Thanks. TRANSFER DONE Here you are. Thanks. Will you be with your family? The family, uncles and aunts, and you? With my family too. I was wondering if you'd have dinner with me, or just coffee, whatever you prefer. Yes, sure. Sometime next week. Great. Merry Christmas. - Bye. - Bye. Adriana. I'm surprised we weren't notified earlier. You know don Manuel. It's a surprise for our staff. Profit sharing and bonuses, all in cash. Excellent, I would only do this in person. Don't worry. Don Manuel will appreciate this. - Happy holidays. - Same to you. - Thanks. Bye. - Bye. Honey, why don't you go upstairs and pack? I can't go back to my place. No, I don't want to be separated from you. It's better this way, trust me. I'll pay them and be back in 2 hours. Why don't we just leave? They'd find me again. Is it all there? Yes, well, that's half of it, I deposited the rest as we said, in your two accounts in Miami, so it can't be traced as fast, giving us time to get to London. - I need to fix this now. - I'm coming with you. Of course not. I won't let you get hurt. I don't want you to get hurt. Look at me, honey. It's all right. It's all right. They just want their cash. Okay? Do you love me? I love you. I love you. I love you. I LOVE YOU. S. Hi, this is Andrés Soto, it's a beautiful day... Wait, I can't be here. I can't be here. Teresa, wait. How are they? Monse's better, but Andrea is very ill. There's no time to lose. Take Monse back to the infirmary. Yes sir. Have the ambulance take the new highway instead. It goes all around town. We're in a hurry. - I don't care. Do as I say. - Yes sir. Wait for the other ambulance. - I don't think so. - Those are my orders. It's on you if she dies. Okay, get her in. But you need to take the squad car. Yes? Guess what your daughter wants for Christmas. Shut up, Santiago! You're such a gossip, Santiago! Daniel Radcliffe! - You're such a gossip. - Teresa. Hello. Why did your own lawyer poison you? Payback... for betraying Nuro. Betraying Nuro? Victor, let her rest, she needs to stabilize. I'll call another ambulance if she doesn't. You'll have to leave if you can't do as I say. Are they at the hospital? Not yet, due to the new route, but they're reporting back every minute. Have they located Montserrat's attorney? He won't take our calls. Andrés. Andrés. Andrés? What have you done? I don't know how to help you. The cops are going through our hard disks, somebody transferred a lot of money from here. Yes, I... I... I did it. I opened a new account. I stole the money. And now, now there's no money... There's nothing I can do. Move it! Move it! Good job, motherfuckers! Good job, motherfuckers! Good job! Everybody get up there! Move it! Hi. Remember me? Clarissa, the doorwoman. We haven't met. Your Christmas present. Did you bake it? Yes, I hope you like it. It's my first cake. I've only cooked soups and rice. I'm sure it's delicious. Okay then. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. And good luck. Thank you. See you. What's Adriana Ponce's apartment? - She's in 201. - Thanks.
