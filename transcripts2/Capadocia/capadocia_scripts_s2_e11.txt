 AND ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN Of all the sacraments, the one I like most is holy matrimony. That's the one that ensures the survival of the species. That union confirms our faith, and renews our commitment to God, to our community. To the church. In the love between a man and a woman

 is the renewal of that first amazement which allows to see others as divinity sees them, said a blind man. You are a lucky man to have a bride like Gala, Jamal. I know. Then if there's nothing left to be said, let us toast to the future couple. Let us toast to the happiness of Jamal and Gala. That must be Esteban. Wait. Hello. I'm not joking, bitch.

 I don't like getting hung up on. Nobody hangs up on me. My eyes are so sore. Can't we wait a little? We've been at it for two nights now. Tell me what it's for or I'm out. Trust me. I'm tired of giving trust without getting any. I'm tired of loving without being loved back. Colombian, our freedom depends on getting this done in time. Our freedom? Right. Just shut up and trust me, okay? Do you? Of all the scum I've dealt with, you're the worst. But you I love. - Continue. - What else? NEW PRISON OPENED I can't believe you couldn't see the DA. I didn't say I didn't see him. Well nothing's happening. Exo's business is flourishing. Teresa, you have to trust me. Don't do anything without my consent. Yes? We've got the body of a Ms. Margarita Jimenez. You need to identify her. I'm on my way. Gala, he's a hunk. How could you not believe in arranged marriages? Ask your dad to get me one. He's mine. I'm in the restroom. - What's with her? - No idea. You got a job for tonight. Here's the address. Be there on time. I beg you, leave me alone, I'm getting married. Nobody forced you to do this. I swear to God, I'll kill myself. I'll blow my brains out. That's enough! Let's make a deal. What? This is your last job. After all, you're of no use to me dead. Be there on time. Let's talk clearly. I'd like to know exactly how much we're talking about. I mean shipments, merchandise, ports of load. Agreeing on a percentage, a good percentage, of the goods that are exported, and the arms that are going to be imported. What do you think? I like your vision. That means we got a deal? That means I'll think about it. Meanwhile I need you to be at a party. I'm a very busy man. I have a lot of things to do. I'm sorry. Come on, you can't miss this. It's one of those pathetic, dirty little parties, totally deviant. The very best example of the decadence of our times, with no limitations other that your own. Cause of death is cardiac arrest due to exposure. In other words the cold weather killed her. Natural causes. Natural causes? We can't hold the body any longer. Hasn't her daughter come? No, all we have is a letter and her personal belongings. You need to authorize the burial in a common grave. A common grave? It's the procedure. I can't remove the body just now for security reasons. I need a few hours. Sewing shift one. Sewing shift one. Listen, Negra, I'll screw anybody you want, kill anybody you want, I just need a fix. Are you signing that statement? Yes or no? Move it, less talk and more work. What's with Lorena? Is she high? I don't know. But I don't think she should leave tonight. Who cares what you think? I want the Colombian too. Lorena. The Teibolera. And virgin face. Do you know what'll happen if this is made public? Sure I know. Your son would be in big trouble. What's his name? He's cute. I guess you met Bertha's kids out there, Azucena? Have you thought about how they're doing without a mom? They are usually adopted in these cases, you know. They do okay. But... not the kids. That's tougher. And Bertha's and Tatiana's kids are out there. Here, take this. Your case would be a lot easier if you knew what happened. May I Teresa? Please. Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and blessed is... I'm sorry, I had to tell you. Can we talk? I know what it is. Take her away. REST IN PEACE Continue. Holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death, amen. Lorena. Are you okay? Magos knew me a lot better than Patrick. Or even my mom. How can you love a mom that killed her kids? I was in the dark at the time. I thought I knew him. But I didn't. I knew who he was when I saw what he did to my kids. That was unforgivable. No matter how drunk you are, you don't do that to a child. Much less your own. Mom, I don't want to go to Father Nicolas. Why not, baby? Yes you are. - No. - He's a good priest. No he's not good. I thought about killing just him, but then I wondered when I got thrown in jail, what would happen to my kids. - Father Nicolas is so good. - No, he's evil. You look great. What can you expect from others if their dad does that to them? That's why I wanted us to go to heaven together. But the poison didn't work on Irene and myself. It's my life, my body, my virginity. It's my choice, not dad's. You know how much some guys would pay for deflowering a nice girl like you? Is Federico here yet? Call him. Tell him I'm here. Totally Bosque de las Lomas. Her family is loaded. What do you think? How do you do it? They come looking for me sometimes. I'm just a pretext. She's getting married tomorrow. It's a vital business alliance between us and the Middle East. If you still want the actress on that mag cover, I can get her too. I don't care if Victor is there. I've been waiting for an hour. Get them here now or else. Bye. Everything okay? Yes, my mom is a little sick, but it's not serious. Get Margarita Jimenez's body out first thing tomorrow. Yes sir. Okay, move it. Move it, move it. Hey, forget it. You'll have to deal with me. Gentlemen, gentlemen, we are going to begin this evening of pleasure, and this hot desert flower you see here will be the evening's first prize. If you please. And the lucky winner is... Mr. Flavio. That's you. Congratulations. Enjoy. Smile. Smile. Thank you very much. Our next guest will have the pleasure of meeting this exciting woman. Desire to the highest degree. And the lucky winner is... Jorge Ahumada. If you please, sir. This way please. Enjoy. Enjoy. What are you looking at? Are you guys up to something? Are you talking to me or not? Lorena. Emiliano. We need to talk. Cool it. Cool it. Gentlemen, this looks like a wake. What is this? I give you Colombia and Mexico, gentlemen. - What? - No kissing. Come on, why not? Why no kissing? Come here. Emiliano says I can do anything I want to you. And you will, you will. Thank you, thank you. Hold on a second. Your drugs for my freedom. Tell me where it is first. How do I know you'll keep your word? How about a diplomatic Guatemalan passport? All it needs is a picture. Plus you get your kids back. You know where they are? If you keep your part of the deal, I'll take you to them. It's at Capadocia. Here's the blueprint of the basement, the red line is the access route. You haven't kept your part of the deal yet. Excuse me. Yes? Okay, give me a minute. The hookah is the sister of those that use her. It unites them. Add some opium... and the union is sealed, forever. You know why? Because they both get to know heaven together. Want to go to heaven with me gorgeous? Women can't do that. It's a sin. I'm downloading the account and contact data in Cadiz and Morocco. Delete everything. Good. - I need to go to the restroom. - Where? - The restroom. - Don't take long. I'll be right back. - Hi there. - Hello. Where's my cute friend? She left with Emiliano. Who? - The cute one. - She's busy. Where? Hi there. What's up? How am I breaking out? Hurry, you have to get back to Capadocia. You promised. You said you were a queen. That you pick and chose who to sleep with. And now you know different. Son of a bitch! Don't be stupid Lorena. You are nothing, nobody. I just lied to you to get some. But we can do this the hard way. Just try. Joel. Is it you? What's wrong Sofia? Why did you go away? Why did you? Calm down baby. You're laughing? I'm in jail because of you. I killed our baby for you. You're nuts. Nuts? You bitch! Look what you did! You stabbed my leg! Get this crazy bitch off of me! Emiliano! You're not going anywhere. What? What happened? What did I tell you? What did I tell you? I said no junkies! They're prisoners, not nuns. No talking back, idiot. Fucking whore. Get them out of here before I kill all of them. Where's Lorena? Where's Lorena? In my room. Get her. You left her alone? Get them in the car now! It's here. Get it out of here. Get the party going. Gentlemen, everything's fine, let the party continue. Music. - Did anyone leave? - No sir. - You sure? - Sure, I've been here all the time. I've heard a lot about you. Same here, we have thousands of reports on you. What do you want? An agreement that benefits both of us. Why should I trust you? You could be a spy. They'd get you if they wanted to. Whenever there's a raid they call if off because of orders from the top. Or you always vanish 10 minutes before we arrive. Put yourself in my place. I'm risking the same thing with you as with the good guys. Bullets do the same thing to you, all that matters is... What you can get. My family. The State doesn't kidnap them, or threaten to kill them and you do. Secondly, what you said. With you I'd make in a week what I'd make in 30 years of service. I'd have the best of two worlds if I play my cards right. And so would you. She hasn't left, but I can't find her. Search the house. Let nobody leave. What are you doing here? I need to test your loyalty, Victor. Kill him. Kill him. I want you to kill him. They all do that. Okay, okay, okay. You never saw me here, Federico. Go find that woman. She can't get out of here. Lorena Guerra is a Capadocia inmate. She says the stash Cristobal stole from me is there. You need to find it. Get rid of all the witnesses, including Lorena. Whatever you say. We have her sir. Where is she? Did you think you could run, you idiot? Who do you think you are? Get in there! Gate. Gate. Look what I got. Hello. Yes it's me, aunt. It's late. How can I help you? I'll be right there. You're leaving me behind, aren't you? I'm here, right? Yes but you're leaving. I know. If anything happens to me, give this to Teresa. Nobody else. Anything like what? I'll be fine. Just in case. I only trust you. You do? Even if I don't trust you? Even if I don't love you? Even if I hate your guts? I still trust you. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. Juan is the priest's girl. You'd betray me? This is my payment for my freedom. I had to switch the real drugs for fake stuff before you called the cops. Who were you going to give it to? The owners of all this. The guys behind Federico, Exo. Who are they? Who owns Exo? We need to hurry before they get here. Stop that, I'm calling Victor Hernandez. Victor can't know about this. He's with them. He was at the drug lord's house. He almost killed Federico. No way. No way! What do we do now? Take your kids and go away as far as you can. What about you and your kids? Me and my kids are dead if I leave now. You know where they are? You'd help me find them. Thanks, girlfriend. Bye, mom. Make love to me. No, Gala. I'll wait until we get married. Because if it's so good to sleep at your side, I can't imagine what it'll be like when you give me your virginity, and I give you mine. Men like you don't exist anymore. What did you think when you first saw my photo? Honestly, I thought you were starving. You were so skinny with those big ears. I'll be right down. Can I help you, miss? Are you Margarita Jimenez's husband? You could say so I guess. What do you want? I'm a social worker and the state has an insurance policy on the deceased lady for her next of kin. Deceased? Didn't your daughter tell you? Magos passed away. Dear God. Come in. Thanks. Here's the paperwork sir. All we need is your okay. Everything okay? Did you check inside? I did it myself and everything's okay. But if you want... Take her away. This way please. Gate. - I have to go. - Teresa Can we talk? I have a date I can't miss with my kids. Just a few minutes. I'll call you when I'm done. I can't forgive her for what she did to my kids, but I wish her well. Let God be the judge of that. That's right. Can I ask you a few questions? Of course. Do you have any dependents? My daughter Irene and my grandson. It's for them I'm taking the money. Your son or grandson? Where do I sign, miss? Right here. Lorena. What do you want? To help you find your kids. What do you want? What do I want? Tell me why you did what you did. I did nothing. That nutcase Magos made it up. I was drunk. I didn't know what I was doing. Were you drunk when you married your daughter? When you had a baby with your daughter? She's my child, right? My daughter. I gave her life, I can do anything I want to her. I fed her and I dressed her. She's mine, you hear? Mine! - Here. - Thanks. What do you think, dad? Hello. That's her. Come with us miss. You're under arrest. What's this, dad? You belong to a band of prostitution. We arrested your boss, Antonio Garcés. He squealed on you. Dad, don't do this to me. What are you doing? What is this? Let go of me. Let go. Please. Ready, Santiago? - Yes. We haven't been to the gym in ages, why now? Your dad needs to work out and we some family time. I'm not going. Play the happy family game with Ruth, she buys it. Andrea, this is not a game. Come on, please. Your passports. Here. Pay attention. Whatever happens, with our without us, you must get on that plane. - You're not coming? - Where are we going? Canada, we want to go too, but no matter what happens, listen to your mom and get on the plane. Come, come, come. One of my best men is in jail for extortion and procuring. And all his people with him. What were you thinking? That you'd get your photos back just like that? That you're so powerful? Answer me you idiot. Well, we've locked horns, you know who I am now. And don't you forget it. Your name is on it. Where are you going mom? - To the toilet. - But we're taking off. What happened to your plan for your kids? Kids, you know. Last minute cancellation. So can we talk? Sure, if you need to. I need to do something. Go to my office. I need Lorena in the restroom now. Thanks. Why did you come back? Because I'm either stupid or crazy. Or because you make mistakes when you think with your heart. Here. Welcome to Capadocia. Walk on the red line. Move it! I don't have all day! Move it. Gate. Gate. This way. Your belongings. Follow the line. Lore. Lore. - Hortensia. - Yes ma'am. - How are you. - Fine thanks. Gate. These files have certain irregularities. I'll get that ma'am. - I'm sorry Hortensia. - No problem. - Can you do that? - No problem. Go home. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Lorena's gone! Lorena's gone!
