 Only Fernando should've blown them out, because it's his birthday. You'll all have your chance to blow out your candles on your birthdays. What if I don't have any more birthdays? God wants you to have a lot of birthdays, honey. That's why you're having your operation like Fernando. Let's sing Las mańanitas one more time. I can't believe what you've achieved with these kids. It wasn't me, father. You ruined our lives, you son of a bitch.

 You took my daughter away from me. You bastard. You worthless scumbag. You'll rot in hell. But first I'll see you writhing in pain. Bastard! What you've done is unforgivable. Magos, Magos. Magos. Are you okay? He raped all of them, Lorena. Irene, my eldest daughter, got pregnant. That's why I tried to take them to heaven with me,

 to stop their pain. I didn't know what to do. All I could think of was the rat poison. I made some soup, and we had it. God took the youngest. But He decided to spare Irene and me. She lost her child. Mom. That's beautiful. Let's see how it looks on you. Stop making fun of me. Tell my teacher I can't make it. Why? I'll look stupid and you're busy. A corny mom like me wouldn't miss it for anything in the world. This time nothing will stop me from seeing you as a jarcha. I'll look stupid. We'll look stupid together, what's the problem? You can use your car to take your sister from school to her rehearsal and straight back home. - But mom... - Take it or leave it Andrea. He's had enough, Elsa. Go back to work. He's still hungry. Isabel will punish you if you're still here when the social worker comes. Why is she still here? He won't eat. Babies do that sometimes. But she'll leave soon. You have ten minutes. Amy, you have good taste. What do you think? Is that an S? Yes, why? - I thought it was a C. - A C? That doesn't matter. It's very nice. Yes? So you like it? Look. That's beautiful. - It is, isn't it? - Yes. This is awful, one more balloon and I won't be able to talk. Just blow and keep quiet and we might just like you. I can't wait to see my kid. She's in primary school already. But my mom hardly brings her to see me. You're lucky to have a girl. I have two boys and there's no controlling them. How can a witch like you have kids? What? Politicians have kids, so why can't I? I never get to see them. Last time I saw them they were very little. But you know what? I would do it all over again if I had the chance. I just wouldn't get caught this time, no way. Stop whining. All that matters is that you'll see your kids. It's going to be a very nice occasion. That's all that matters, so stop whining. - Who's whining, Magos? - On Mother's Day? We need to make the effort to make everybody happy. Think about how great it is to be a mom. Right, cooped up in here it's really great. Come right in. Have a seat. Good afternoon. How can I help you? You are Irene, right? I'm glad you came. Magos will be pleased to see you. What makes you think I'm here to see that old hag? So why are you here? I want my money. "Capadocia inmates to have salaries". Only the inmates can decide where that money goes. Part of that money is mine. You know I'm the only child she has left. Here, I want my money. Nobody has come to see Magos in fifteen years, and as far as I know, she's heard nothing from you. Will you quit lecturing me and give me my money? I'm in a hurry. The social worker is here. I'll be right there. What about me? I already told you how it works. Are you ready, child? Yes father. It's just that these poor saints look shabbier every day. It's so obvious they make them with no love whatsoever. They don't even put eyelashes on them anymore. Don't worry about that. They are our livelihood. They help us help others, and that's all that matters. Now go get your things. You'd better be on your way. Now go get your things. You'd better be on your way. Father, I'd like you to hear my confession before I go. What do have to confess? What sins could you possibly have committed? Please father. Okay, I absolve you. Go on. God is very, very close to you always. He has reserved a very special place for you. Don't make this any harder. We have to do this. He's better off with me than in a foster home. The social worker is here now. It's not when you say. Give him to me. Elsa, give him to me. Guards. Let go of me. Get off of me. Let me go. Let me go. Give me my baby back. Calm down Elsa. They're taking my baby away. It's all your fault. Calm down, we discussed it and you agreed to this. Please give me my baby back. You know we can't have babies in Capadocia. Give him back to me. Give him back to me. Take him away. Let go of me! Take her to my office. Get off of me. Let me go. Just wait until you lose a child. You'll see what if feels like. Let me go. Look, Lorena. I made this for you. What's the matter child? You've been avoiding me. What did I do to you? I don't see how you can be so happy on Mother's Day. You think you know everything, don't you? You must think I'm just a heartless crazy old hag. You gave birth to your kids once. First I brought mine into this world. Then I sent them to heaven. They are fine where they are. They are fine. Magos. Irene was here today. She wants 30 % of your salary, which a family member is entitled to. I told her it was up to you. But now I'm not sure I should have told her so. How is she? Is she healthy? Is she too thin? Has she forgiven me? Maybe one day she'll come to see you. Everything has to be just right, Federico. If you can't do it, I won't take the deputies over. No problem. Tears will come to your eyes. Even the deputies will need their hankies. We'll have tons of contracts after this. I hope so, this experiment is costing us a fortune. Don't forget about tonight. That's getting a bit tangled. Isabel is getting wary about letting the Colombian out. I need to see her at 11 p.m. sharp at your place. Now what? It's me, sir. Bambi is desperate to get out of here. Tell her I'm on it. I tell her so every day to no avail. What do I care? Make up something. Tell her I'm abroad, or that the judge said no, just keep her quiet. She's threatening me. If we don't do as she says, she'll snitch on me and you. I'll get her some drugs tomorrow to calm her down. Damn it. How do I feel, you idiot? How would you feel if they took your baby away? Do you have any kids, doctor? Let's focus on you for now. You know what really makes me mad? That pitiful look on your face. You guys have kids at home and you call them by their names. I couldn't even name mine. And you know why? So I wouldn't get attached to him. He was just my baby, my little boy. But I still got attached to him doctor. You agreed to breastfeed him until we found a home. You chose to put him up for adoption. Haven't you ever made a mistake you regretted all your life? It's so easy for you to give away other people's kids. It's not fair, doctor. I couldn't even christen him. It's not fair. I agree with you Elsa. It wasn't fair for your dad to beat you up as a kid. It isn't fair that nobody ever gave you a chance in life. But it is also unfair that because of your fit of anger, a woman will spend her life in a wheelchair. Now you want to change your son's life. And you think that's fair? You've never been alone, have you? You don't know what it's like to be ignored and scorned. Is that why you had your baby? To have someone close? Elsa, it wasn't wrong to do that. I know it won't be easy, but eventually, I will help you feel better. There you go, kids. Hand me those plates, Irene. Lets have our soup. Then God will come for us. Is he getting off the cross? Yes, but then we're going to a very nice place. Is dad coming too? No. Not him. We're going somewhere he'll never find us. Let's see if you like the soup and who finishes first. What is it, Magos? Is this seat taken? I'm Sofia. You have nice hair. Is that the real color? The others are really scary, but you're different. You'll be out soon, like me, right? Yes, right, sweetie. That's what we all say. We'll be out soon. You think your husband is sad? He's with another woman. - My husband is not like that. - He's a got a dick, right? Leave her alone. You're scaring her even more. I wouldn't like to see her get cheated on, like you. Shut up Yolanda. You shut up, I don't care if you're Magos' little girl. Do you know when she's getting out? That's not how it works, kiddo. It's tough. Some cases take even months. Some even years. But I think we can convince a few people. You know what I mean? I gave you all my savings. I have nothing else. I'm not asking you for anything. I'm just telling you how it is. And I'm telling you my wife has to get out of there. I killed that woman, not her. Don't complicate things. Just imagine. She'd be charged with perjury and manslaughter to boot. Let sleeping dogs lie. You know what I mean? That would cost much more. Careful. - Thank you. - You need help? No thanks, goodbye. They're just a little chipped. We can fix that. Maybe a little paint is all we need. They're so inconsiderate with people's luggage. I know. How lovely. Do you make these, mother? No, they're from my hometown. Somebody ordered those, but I do have some just like them. This one is handmade too. That's nice, but I'll take this one. Look at the craftsmanship. I like this one. Aren't these some weird statues? What's this? Hold it. Get the nun. Look where you're going, nun. - Mom will get you for this. - Don't be ridiculous. Take me to school now or I'll be late. Stop pretending you want to go to school. You don't want to go to the festival and you'll look stupid in that dress. Where are you going? Shut up and stay put. Daniel. Hello there. Hi Daniel. How are you? Your mom isn't here. That's only on Tuesdays. Now what do I do? What's wrong? I'm working on a paper on human rights, and I thought she could help me out. I can't see her at the prison and she's never at home. I could help you if you want. We'd have to go somewhere a little quieter. - Sure. - Here's my number. - Here. - Okay. - Thanks. - No problem. The platform's here, the inmates will be here, and our special guests, the deputies, here, and with the performers we hired, it will be a huge success. Our special forces will escort the performers, and stay near the stage. No, this is a special event. You'll just scare everybody. When we first discussed this, we talked about something simple. This is too much. But if you want to throw money away, I can think of lots of better ways. Don't worry about it. The money isn't coming out of your pocket, or from Capadocia's budget for that matter. It won't cost you a cent either. I don't understand, Teresa. You say you want the best for your inmates and you're against their Mother's Day celebration? It's the best Mother's Day they'll ever have. How touching, Federico. But you forgot to mention all the publicity your little show will get you. It's another one of those evenings. I'll pick up the Colombian by midnight. How much longer is this going to continue? You think I know? Have you any comment sir? How long have you been doing this, mother? Somebody's protecting you. Who is protecting you, mother? Answer me. These sacred objects were sacrilegiously used to transport the drugs. The question is whether the Church has anything to do with this heroin scandal. Santiago, we meet at 5 with the historians and architects regarding the restoration of the historical center. These are the plans of the buildings to be renovated. Okey, get ready for the meeting with the businessmen. Let's see who's interested. Hello. Yes. I'll be right over. Take your lunch break Tomás. We'll meet here at 3. Tell the secretary and the guards to do the same. What about you? I have some things to do around here. Santiago, thanks for seeing me. Monsignor. I hope nobody saw us. Don't worry about it. So what can I do for you? A nun was arrested this morning and charged with drug trafficking, and of course, the press blew it up out of all proportion. So I had to speak with the attorney general to speed up the process and have her sent to the new women's prison. Only a judge can decide who gets sent to Capadocia. I have nothing to do with it. You could make a few calls. We're talking about a federal offense, Monsignor. We're also talking about a poor helpless nun. We need to put her in a place where she will feel safe enough We need to put her in a place where she will feel safe enough to give us the names of my religious colleagues who have also fallen into temptation. We all need one another, Santiago. Probably not now, but sometime in the future. You can't run a city all by yourself. Alright, Monsignor. Let's say I do make those calls. Would you be willing to stop your people from interfering with your voters' opinion in the next elections? I'm not asking for your endorsement. Just stop attacking me from your pulpits. I think we need to keep her under observation for the next two to three days. She could hurt herself and others. She also needs medication for her depression. I need your authorization. She just lost her baby and all we do is drug her? That won't stop the pain. Many of them get pregnant knowing they can't keep the baby. You're not in charge of their lives. I know, I've seen this one time too many. I know you're against the use of drugs. But it's what's best for her. I took her baby away the day before Mother's Day. You took nothing away from her, Teresa. These women live on the edge. You need to learn not to get emotionally involved. Do whatever you think is best. Please get undressed. You will now be searched. Is there someplace I can change? The procedure is the same for everybody. Nobody gets any special treatment. For God's sake. I beg you, don't do this to me. Get out, all of you. This is a prison. Nobody's religion or anything else matters in here. You are just another criminal. So get undressed like all the others, you hear me? - Hi. - Hi. Have a seat. I just had it done. Isn't it great? But I can't tell mom. She'll yell at me. I guess she'll ground me again, but I don't care. Where's Andrea? She's studying with someone somewhere. Well I'm sorry for you, but you'll have to put up with me all by yourself. What's wrong mom? Nothing, I just need some TLC from my daughter. I told you us moms are very, very very corny. So human rights agencies stand up for us in cases of abuse of power. It's not like people think, that the powers that be can do whatever they want. So if my mom gets silly, I could charge her with abuse of power? Your mom is a great woman. All daughters think like that about their moms. No, you see her in front of the chalkboard, the bright attorney and all that, but I live with her and I know all about her. She only thinks about herself. Ask my dad if you want. Is she still interested in him? The poor guy is desperate. Why did they separate? I don't know, one day Mom kicked him out just like that. I think she got bored of him, that's all. I'm not scared of you anymore. What's more, if that ever happens again, you're the one I'd kill. Talk all you want. You've always been scared of me. You tried to kill me but you failed. You should've had the soup. You'd be rotting in your grave. Rotting in hell. Fear. That's all our kids ever knew. But you can't touch them now, you bastard. Too bad my poor Irene didn't die too. And now she hates me. Go to bed you crazy woman. Come. Come on. Hi honey. - Do you know what time it is? - Sorry, I just wanted to say hello. Daniel, I've told you not to call me at home. I know, but I have something important to tell you. Hold on. Where were you? With some schoolmates. A paper's due tomorrow. You switched your cellphone off and I've told you... I know but we were in the library, and we had to switch off our cellphones. I swear I'm not lying. I'm not scolding you honey. I just care about you, that's all. Sorry, that was my daughter. What is it? How much longer are you going to punish me? I haven't seen you in weeks. I miss you. Can we talk about this some other time? Okey, tomorrow. Maybe Saturday, but I can't promise anything. I have to go. There's another call. Hello. Hello. I'm on my way. I like how you put it on and take it all off. I can take it all off again if you want. No baby, I'm exhausted. You know what baby? If you get me out of there, you have no idea. I'd make you the happiest man in the world. Just the world? You're not exactly humble. Maybe I could. Really? So what are we waiting for? Okey, but it's late and you have to go back. - You know what time it is? - I'm quaking. Right. I'm fed up of being this bastard's pimp. - Cool it. - What do you do to him? The hardest part was shaking off the press. But nobody knows we brought her here. The Attorney General called. He wants her to be isolated until she's interrogated. When were you going to tell me? There is a screening process you know. I had to, Teresa. Are any priests involved? Any nuns in your parish? I want the names, mother. I don't know. I just did it for the kids, to help pay for their treatment. These are the priests that christen the kids of the Gulf cartel in your area. Who is your contact? FatherJorge Alvarez? Is he your contact? No. Father Alvarez is a saint. He wouldn't hurt a fly. So how come you are so nervous? Dear God have mercy on me. Blessed Mother of mercy, Mother of hope. Take a good look at them. That crap you buy and sell killed all of them! Do you want to kill more people? Murderer. Murderer! Talk to me. Who gave you the drugs? Who, who? - Stop it. - I didn't kill anyone. You will refrain from torturing anyone here while I am in charge. I'm sorry, the Attorney General... He knows this is highly irregular. She has already signed her statement. Now it's up to a judge to decide, so please leave. I killed nobody. Dear God, please help me, help me. - I killed nobody. - Call Julian. I killed no one. I killed no one. I killed no one, mother. I killed no one, mother. Dear God, dear God! Hi. Hi. Got a cigarette? And a light? Thanks. You like it rough, right? Bambi wants you to know she's tired of waiting. Send her to that new jail or you're dead meat. I'm sorry I phoned you last night. I hope I didn't interrupt anything. Nothing important, just a little orgy. About that nun, whatever they did to her last night is more than she can bear. Yes, and they will continue pressuring her to talk. I can't authorize it, not in her state. Don't worry, I'll just keep putting it off. And again I'm sorry I interrupted your party. - Did she take her medication? - All of it, doctor. - Call me when she comes to. - Okay. Please follow me, Juli. Please follow Juli, Santi. Stay close to me, boys. I'll take that. I'll take that, baby. Juli. Juli, Juli, listen. I can't walk if you grab my leg. We're going to see mom, so stay close to me. You can't run in here. Okay? We're going to see mom. Come, Santi. Come, Juli. Thank you. Come, Juli. There's mom. Juli, give mom her present. Say hello to mom. How are you? Juli, tell mom what you learned at school. Facing you, right? Yes, go ahead dear. Nobody knew where he went. Nobody saw him at home. Then we heard the frog go: I miss you so much honey. I miss you too honey. I can't bear to think you're in here. It's not that bad. Do you know when I'm getting out? Yes. Soon. Very soon. I hope I didn't get you in trouble. I'll find out tomorrow. Thank God everybody is with their mom today. I have to go to the party. Let me talk to Ruth. Hi Mom. We're on our way to school. She looks like a walking pińata. Shut up. Did you hear that, mom? Don't mind her, honey. When we get home, I'll show you pictures of her as the Flower Queen. - Queen of the pumpkin blossoms? - Shut up. Stop acting like you're toddlers, girls. Don't stand me up, mom. No, honey. I swear I'll be there before the show starts. I love you very much, baby. See you later. Irene. You're so thin my child. Aren't you eating properly? You have to look after yourself. Don't think I like being here. The director says you need to sign some papers, so I can claim what's mine as your... your relative. I need the money. My dad is sick. Your dad? Irene, don't tell me you're living with him. That is my problem. Child, please, get out of there, get away from him. That bastard doesn't deserve you. So... are you going to pay me for what you did to me? For the miscarriage you caused? Yes or no? Twenty-five female jailers work three eight-hour shifts. The special forces team is on duty 24/7. Nothing can take us by surprise. Everything is covered. Riots and jailbreaks are totally unthinkable here. And we monitor the entire place from there. I've become so attached to my little boy. I love him so much. My little baby, the one that will suck my breast and help me carry on. Now what? You're on your own now kid. After all, wherever my baby ends up, he could have enough to eat, or not. He could be mistreated, or not. He could be raped, or murdered. After all, who cares? You gave him away. Congratulations, mom. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. I think none of the moms out there can appreciate as much as you do, how important the well-being, the health, the freedom and the happiness of your kids might be. You need to be very tough to bear to be separated from them in here, and in spite of your loneliness and your sadness, to still afford them all your love and your support. And to continue being the center of your families, in spite of your own adversity. I would like to make a commitment to all of you, I want us to do it together. I want us to work hard so that in the near future, each one of you can go back where you belong, back home to your families and your kids. Happy Mother's Day. And now, we have a wonderful surprise for you. Mrs. Denise de Kalafe. Welcome. Thank you very much. Thank you. Nice speech. Thank you doctor. - Madam. - Yes? I just want you to know that you can give the money to Irene. Let's get down to business. One... two... - Where is Elsa? - In the ward. - Who is with her? - Nobody. Nobody? - Are you okay? - Yes. Encore! Encore! - Thank you. - Elsa. Thank you so much. Encore! Encore! Hello. Father. I need you to take my confession. What about Ruth? She understands. She was great. She looked beautiful. Sometimes, some inmates touch us in a special way... rather than others. If someone had told me a few years ago that I would run the first penitentiary reform project of the 21 st. century, I would have thought that a god had heard my prayer. But the gods work in very strange ways, sometimes even with a dark sense of humor.
