 Mrs. Lagos. I'd like a word. Let her in. I want to do what you said. Plead self-defense in Bambi's death. You can help me for good conduct. - Good morning ma'am. - Good morning. Come in. Sit down. So you need my help. Alright. Let's get something straight first. Where is the secret exit you talked about? Answer me, where? Or should Hernandez interrogate you?

 I made it up so you'd take me with you. I don't believe you. I've pored over the blueprints for days, looking for such an exit, with no success. Don't you think I'd use it myself? I need your help. My kids are at risk. Patrick is an addict. I can't stay here. Help me. You do drugs too, Lorena. I went looking for you and you were conked out. I didn't want to. It was forced on me. BY Whom? I can't tell you. See how I can't trust you? You owe me big time, Teresa. You're not in any position to call any favors. Guard. End of shift. End of shift. What's wrong Magos? Are you okay? Move it! Move it! Quickly! End of shift. End of shift. Return to your cells. Return to your cells. Move it Magos. Return to your cells. Come on, Magos. Return to your cells. - Are they all in their cells? - Yes Victor. They can't know she's here. Understood? - Yes sir. - Hold it, officer. Sofia. You'll be okay. Don't worry. Go ahead. So what? Do they need something, anything? I need to get them some textbooks. I can get them tomorrow if you like. What? Do you think I'm lying? That I keep the money? No, mom. I'm just trying to help you out here. This is all I have. I'll get more tomorrow. This will do. It's enough. What time does my kid come home? She's having supper at a friend's place. But why? You knew I was coming. Why do you want to see her? To be with her for 20 minutes and go whoring again? Mom, she's my kid and I want to see her. Don't you get it? She gets upset when you're around. It's not her fault she has a mom like you. But if that's what you want, fine, I'll pack her things, pick her up and she's all yours. Can you give her this? You can tell her you got it if you like. Listen. Guess who's in the infirmary. I'm not interested in idle gossip. Sofia's back in Capadocia. Sofia who? The one you're thinking about. They lied to us about her dying. She's alive and kicking, Negrita. The gossip wasn't so idle after all. Sofia, we'll make sure to keep you safe. But you need to help us too. How are you feeling? You're nervous and afraid. You're worried. It's okay. It's okay. Can I see your arm? Does it hurt? It's no good. It's dead. Look, Sofia. The doctor took a look at it. It's perfectly okay, no broken bones, or ligaments, or pulled muscles. It's perfectly okay. It's dead. I'm not lying. Tell us what happened the day you broke out. I did nothing. My arm hurts and it hurts a lot. I think she can't remember. Or she's pretending and we need to know why. Nobody can pretend like that. What do you think, Valeria? I think she saw the man she loved die horribly. I don't see how you can say she's pretending. I just think it's possible. There's no clinical evidence to support that. She's blocking her memory, hence the anxiety, the physical manifestations, the arm thing. The clinical term is posttraumatic stress disorder. Not knowing what happened means we can't know who or what to protect her from, or avoid a trial for the death of 2 police officers. Can we help her remember? Sure, but we need time and she needs therapy. And I'm sorry, but you need to let me do my job. According to Valeria's evaluation, Sofia isn't mentally capable to face trial. It's inevitable. All I ask for is a little time to get her memory back. The judge has been very understanding, but he won't grant any more extensions. Sofia has a right to a fair trial. It's clear that the bullets that killed the officers weren't fired from the car she and her husband were in. I know that, Teresa, but in the eyes of the law, she has to be tried for killing two police officers. I know and the hearing is very soon. If she doesn't produce any convincing evidence, they'll crucify the woman. I'll ask the D.A. to get the judge to grant another extension. Thanks Victor. Excuse me. Don't worry, Emiliano. Everything's just fine. The new prison's workshop is always busy. So what's the problem? There's no problem, we just need some more time, maybe two weeks more to fill your order. I don't want to disappoint you. Your order's shipping when it's ready. You won't disappoint me. Don't worry. Alvaro. Yes? What do you think about that one? She's hot, right? She's as trashy as they come. Princess, my friend needs to relax. - I said I wasn't interested. - Come, Mercedes. What's wrong with you? We don't want to end up dead like Cristobal, right? So cool it and cooperate. As I was saying, Alvaro, this girl right here is one of the hottest here. Don't be shy. Go with her, please. He gets stressed out, but we'll be fine. Federico, can I treat you to a girl too? Of course. I suppose not, right? Let's go, I promised Gina I'd be back early. What a party pooper. He isn't even married and he's pussy whipped. Okay, but just a nightcap. - This one's hot. - I really like this one. You're drooling. No! Please! Forgive me! Move it girl! Next time don't bring me to these lousy strip joints. Check this out Alvaro. What? What? You think you're better than me? You can't kill me, asshole. I asked you a question. Are you better than me? I am important. Are you better than me? Okay, let's get this straight. You are a big fat nobody. I run this business. I can find 20 little pawns like you guys, with as much prestige and gladrags as any of you. So? So who's the boss? Who is the boss? You are the boss. Will my shipment be in Spain in a week? Yes, I swear to God, you'll have it in a week. You could be next. But you I would drop. Are you okay? Son of a bitch. He's fucking nuts. Ruth, why are you still up? Waiting for you. I can't sleep as usual. Have they taken down the tree at Capadocia? Yes. But I saved your sister's fat papier-mâché angels. What a cheesy fool. Only she likes these things. Don't you? No, they're just pagan symbols capitalism exploits to boost sales during Christian holidays. Shut up, come here, give us a kiss. Monse. You look great, Monse. You look really pretty. How are you? I miss you so much. Andrea. You got me killed. Andrea. Andrea. Andrea. Andrea. Andrea. You got me killed. It's the third time this week, Paola. What the hell is wrong with you? Nobody noticed. They always notice. You go blank when you have a seizure. I'm sorry Rubio, I've just been a little nervous, but I'll control myself. I hope so. Because I won't tolerate anymore of that. Is that clear? You have a private lap dance. Work hard baby. - Right. - Smile. - He's back there. - Thanks. - Ready for me, baby? - I'm ready. No touching. No touching. You're so hot. I've never felt like this with a woman. I'm just doing a lap dance. Yes, but I feel a very strong connection. Let me get to know you baby. I'll wait until you're off and we'll go out and talk. - Look, this is how it works. - How? You pay, I dance. The music stops, and we each go our own way. I'm a nice guy, really. Let me buy you some drinks, or dinner, you name it. And we'll talk. I'm Miguel. The music stopped. Wait, I'll pay you again. But don't leave. No whore leaves me. One is enough. Fucking bitch. Ten minutes, sir. What've you got for me? So, you finally show your face. Look, Negra, it's not easy for either of us, we just have to cooperate, got it? No, Federico. You get this. You and your bosses have everything to lose if I decide to talk. You want me to tell Teresa Lagos who paid me to organize the first riot? Or about Emiliano's drugs? You have no proof. I do have proof. I have enough proof to put you away for good for having Brenda Yamilet murdered. So tell your bosses that it's up to me to let their prison business keep working. Is that so? What proof do you have? I recorded you telling me to go ahead with the riot. Do it today, Negra. Brenda Yamilet's lawyer, telling me to kill her, and mentioning very clearly, your name, and your boss' name. All of that is in a very safe place in case something bad happens to me. I'm no idiot, Federico. I'd never get involved in this business without life insurance. What do you want? For the moment, protection in Capadocia. All the drugs I need to keep these bitches happy, just until you guys get me out of here. You know it's not as easy to smuggle drugs in as before. You know that perfectly well. Things have changed for the worse. That's your problem. Didn't you hear me, you whore? Hey! Wait! Wait! Don't run away from me. - Leave me alone. - Wait. Let go. Paola! Paola! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I told you. No whore ever leaves me. Mommy. Daddy's here, baby. Daddy's here. It's going to be okay. I promise you it's going to be okay. Forgive me. For what? For what I said about your baby. I shouldn't have hurt you like that. Kids are a blessing. And you deserve one. Thanks. - May I? - Sure. Exit your cells now. Exit your cells now. - Hi Magos. - Good morning. Good morning. Your dad and your sister sent you a huge kiss. I can't stand to see you like this. You should see Valeria. I'm okay. You still have nightmares, so you're not okay. I should've died, not Monse. Andrea, please. That was an accident. It was no accident, mom. I'll be in here all my life. She had a chance to be happy. I wish he'd killed me. Listen, Andrea. It's okay to grieve for her. It's okay to be mad at whoever you want. But you can't give up now. Your dad and I are struggling to get you out. But it won't make any sense if you don't do your part. No matter how painful it is, you must move on, honey. Let's put your knapsack on. That's it. Very good. Let's go. You look great baby. Thanks. - What's your teacher's name? - Viridiana. Well isn't that the cutest name? Yes. The judge denied the extension. He understands our dilemma, but the police department is pressuring him. They want someone to pin the blame on. Sofia's hearing is in a few days. We're in your hands, Valeria. Sofia has to testify. All I can think of now is hypnotherapy, which helps bring out any repressed memories, but I can't guarantee she'll remember the real events. That's something to start with. We need the tiniest clue. I need to be there with you. That's unethical, Victor. I can't allow it. I wouldn't allow it in any other situation, but it's our job to make sure she doesn't get life in prison. Maybe Victor can help. Oh please, Negra's just bluffing. You think that idiot has the brains to do that? Sorry, but I've known her for a while, and I wouldn't be too sure of that. We could have her dealt with like we did with Alzati. Yes, but Emiliano says we can't touch her. I don't take orders from that jerk. Understood? Your left arm is just fine, you can move it, there's no pain. What do you see? I'm outside. With whom? With Joel. We're together. Then what happens? Joel. Give them the envelopes. Let them go away. Let them go away and leave us alone. Who, Sofia? I don't know. - Take a good look. - Don't interfere. Joel, why are we armed? Why are we armed? Joel, it's a trap. A trap! You're in a safe place, you're protected. They're shooting at us. They're shooting the cops. Joel, please hurry. Describe them. Listen to me and wake up at the count of three. One. Two. Three. Are you okay? What does he want? - Are you staying? - I'm her legal counsel. What do you want? Ma'am, my client is willing to make a deal. If you agree, my law firm will handle your case, and I guarantee you'll be free in a few years. Plus you'll be entitled to a huge settlement, which will allow you to live quite well. Just sign here. Five million pesos? Five million pesos, exactly half the joint assets we earned together working. Your client is most generous. You gave up those assets when you were convicted. My client is willing to give them back to you. In exchange for what I wonder? Her parents will withdraw their claim to the kids' custody. No way, this man is a threat to my kids. Look, Lorena, I love my kids, and they need me. What happened was a mistake... A mistake? Juli almost died! It wasn't my fault. No? Look at you. You're an addict. - I'm no addict! - Yes you are! Control your client or I'll have him removed. Calm down, Patrick. I hope last year's Nativity actors come back. The chief demon was just drop-dead gorgeous, I could be all over him like a book. I swear when I see one of those I thank God I'm a woman now. Don't thank God, Tona, thank the doctor that sliced your dick off, and sewed those tits on. This is just the frame. God made me a woman inside where it matters. Right, Magos? Magos, are you okay? You're so pale. I'm fine. Are you sure? Magos, what is it? Get a guard, hurry. Magos. Magos. Are you okay? Magos. You can't just jump in my therapy. I'm just doing my job. I can't do this. It's so disrespectful. She almost went into shock. But she didn't, and she could avoid a double-homicide trial. Excuse me. I can't do this. Victor just wants to help. He just wants to help? She's just police work to him. To me she's a person that's hurting a lot. Someone that saw a loved one die, plus the whole situation she was already in. I hope you're not taking it personally. It's not personal, I just need to work like I always have. I just can't work like this. Mateos, I need a favor. Hi daddy. Come draw something. No, baby. In a little while. In a while. Hi. These are for you. He's a fine customer. Be nice to him baby. Sure. "Please have a drink with me. Miguel." Fucking bitch! That's for being such a jerk. Did you switch the camera off? - Yes. - And the nurse? Having coffee. I'll distract her. Sofia is sedated. You have 5 minutes until the next patrol. Negra, if you get caught and you rat on me, you're a dead bitch. Get off her! - It was her! It was her! - Freeze! It was her. She killed Brenda! She helped me escape. She killed Brenda. Take her away. Move it! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Hello. Teresa. My plan worked. Andrea's getting out. Thanks, Victor. What's going on? Who was that? The nightmare is over, Santiago. Andrea's coming home. Eat this. No, Lore, I'm not hungry. You need to get your strength back. I'm never getting up from here. Don't be ridiculous. You'll be fine. Give us a minute, Lorena. No, ma'am. Whatever it is, ma'am, let Lore stay with me, please. It's pancreatic cancer. It's pretty bad. The doctors say... That I'm dying. I've been holding it off for a while now. Isn't that something? I had to be at death's door for you to touch me again. We came to get the boys, Patrick. We have a court order sir. The judge gave custody to the Guerra family. I suggest you let us in. Juli. Boys, where are you? Come. Come with grandpa and grandma. - We'll have fun, honey. - We're getting ice-cream. Where are we going? Who are those people? They're friends, son. We're going to grandpa's place. - Isn't daddy coming? - Later. I just spoke with Ismael Santoyo. He won the case. Your parents have custody of your kids. Thank you so much. They picked them up. We won. We won! - Cheers. - Cheers. In the restroom I heard Brenda Yamilet say, Hello Negra, and I taped everything. With your honor's leave, I'd like to file this evidence, the cellphone the witness used to tape the crime. The phone that was found at the deceased Joel Miranda's house. It will be entered as evidence. The guy you paid to kill Sofia confessed. Who ordered you to kill Brenda Yamilet? Nobody. I whacked her because she couldn't sing. Do you want to continue blaming yourself? Risking being killed in here? I'd like to see them try. Forget it, boss. As screwed as I am, you're not getting a word out of me. Officer. Take her away. General population. Thanks Sofia, for getting me out of here. No problem. All that matters is you're out. We'll miss you. Be good, I don't want to see you in here again. - Never again. - We have to go. - Don't forget us. - Of course not. - Come see us. - I will. - We'll miss you. - We have to go honey. Take care. - I'm going home, Juve. - God be with you my child. Thanks, I promise to come and see you. - Really? - Yes, I'll miss you. Me too. God be with you, bye. - Are you leaving? - Yes. Finally. Take care now. - I will. Behave. - No, you behave. - Let's go. - Just a minute. Take me to my cell. Great, Negra's back! Take me to my cell! You gave Magos a hard time, right? Stay away from me. You think you're so tough! We're gonna beat the crap out of you! How did you like all my cheesy stuff? I loved it. What's up with this Christmas tree? Its February. Your sister wanted you to see it. And I'm the cheesy one? Come here. You can kiss me all you want. We asked all your friends over to welcome you home. - Isabel and Pilar too? - Everybody. Thanks. For the attempted murder of Miguel Aguilar Garcia, Paola Céceres Beltrén is hereby ordered to be... Paola Céceres Beltrén, attempted murder. Walk the red line. Move it! Move it. It's almost 11. They're not coming. I knew they'd shun me.
