 ATONEMENT Will they be here soon? Remember, don Nuro, every minute counts. Let's get something straight, Doc. I got you everything you needed to save her, so tell me if you need anything else. Drugs, equipment, anything. That's not the point. Time is of the essence, don Nuro. They're here, son! They're here.

 Come, they're here. Come, Doc, come. That smells good, grandma. Well it's machaca, son, with molcajeteada sauce just as you like it. Great. Hi. Did Monse get hit? No, just Pancho in the belly and a bullet grazed Damian. The doc should see Pancho. - No, Monse's first. - What about him? The doc will see him in the cellar. Help them, Mario. Where is my wife? Where the hell is my wife?

 Who the hell is this kid? - Cool it. How should we know? - What's that? - I told you the plan was flawed. - What? Forget the plan! Who got her off the ambulance? I did, Nuro. Didn't you realize it wasn't her? We saw all those people in the vans, but, but... But what? But what? - She has a mask on. - Please! - Give me your gun, Pato. - Well... - Give me your gun. - Give me another chance. You were a better lawyer, Pato. You suck at this. You idiots! I can't believe this! Calm down, buddy. Nuro. - Sorry I'm late. - Look at the time. I'll take over now. They didn't bring my wife back. The last time I saw her she was dressed in white, grandma. Baby. I'm sorry, buddy. I failed you. It's my fault. Sir, the ambulance should've been empty, but Teresa Lagos took her daughter out before we got to her. The convoy wasn't enough. That's enough, Victor, you screwed up. I want answers. All my men are checking out Nuro's known hideouts. We can't let Nuro leave town after planning this sting for so many months. Please, I don't want another mess-up. Understood sir. Rescue Andrea, and capture Nuro. Not necessarily in that order. Nuro is our first priority. Sir? I'm not glad either, but we're not here to make anyone happy. We have a job to do, that's all. Andrea is our bait. Yes sir. What the hell do we do now? Go find my daughter! What do you suggest, Victor? Talk with the media and tell them that Andrea Marin Lagos was in the ambulance. Are you insane? If we do that, Nuro will kill my daughter the instant he finds out who she is. I'm sorry to say so, but there's a slim chance she's alive. How can you say that? You're talking about our kid. And even if she weren't, she's a person. Go to the media. Tell them who they took. Tell them how they butchered these guys. Maybe when they realize it isn't Monse they have... Maybe they'll demand a ransom, and give us our daughter back. Even if she's dead. Yes? I got Andrea's test results. Hold on. Go on. I got Andrea's test results. The sweets contained the chemical ethylene glycol. She needs ethanol applied intravenously, and a dialysis urgently. The cops found Montserrat's lawyer. Samuel says they found Montserrat's lawyer. Well... If they have him we can talk to him before... Before releasing Andrea's identity. I don't think so, Santiago. There's very little time. You heard her. So interrogate him quickly, immediately. We can't miss this chance. My child isn't a pawn. Santiago, this is urgent. You need to hurry. Victor Hernandez had no business calling you. I don't want you guys in here, dad. If you plan to sue Patrick for the kids' custody, you'll need us. Dad, I haven't needed you all this time. Trust me, I don't need you now. They are our grandkids. Your mother and I can't bear the thought of leaving the kids in that cokehead's hands. How is mom? Struggling with her diabetes, and she says the best thing we can do is accept the fact that we're getting old. Can't you see you can only count on us to save your kids? I know that. My child, stay out of trouble. Don't let him provoke you. For your kids' sake. I'll do my best, dad. Dad. Yes? Thanks. Look, Enrique, if you want to leave me, go ahead, but not with my baby, you horny bastard! Not with my baby, you bastard! You fucking horny bastard! My kid needs a mom. "Pursuant to the evidence in file against the defendant, "and considering that such evidence "is aggravated by both betrayal of trust and forgery, "and pursuant to the provisions "of the previously mentioned code, "you are ordered to serve 15 years in prison "and repay the money obtained by such embezzlement and fraud." What do you want? What do you think? I don't have any. Take care of business, girlfriend. Or hand it over. To you? Why not? Come back later. What about me? I said later. Now, scram. End of shift. End of shift. Return to your cells. Return to your cells. I'm not answering any more questions, on the contrary, I demand that you transfer my client to a place where she isn't drugged, poisoned, not to mention Capadocia's crummy security. The ambulance thing was the last straw. You are right. Nuro's a smart guy. What will he think when he knows you were here? He won't believe you didn't spill the beans. I'm not saying a thing. Get your hands off of me, or I'll sue for brutality. This attack occurred on Christmas Eve itself. One of the paramedics on the ambulance is in critical condition. He stated that one of Capadocia's inmates was apparently poisoned or overdosed. It's okay, grandma. We're here at the spot where a group of gunmen... - We're ready. - Hold on. The authorities are about to hold a press conference. Rest, my child. You'll be fine. Monse. How is Monse? Monse? You know my Monse? How is she? Tell me. - Doctor. - Come outside, grandma. The ambulance was heavily guarded. Who was in it? The prisoner's name is Andrea Marin Lagos, daughter of Capadocia's warden and ex-presidential candidate Santiago Marin. Don't you think all this was orchestrated so the girl could escape? They helped her escape. The ambulance was an act. That was no act. My daughter was kidnapped. And I'd like to take the opportunity to tell the people that have her, to contact me. I speak to you as a father. Give me my child back. Let's negotiate. Happy holidays, baldy. Happy holidays. Careful, doc. Keep her alive. How come? She's leverage. What? I need to go to the restroom. Vicky. Go with her, and keep an eye on her. Hurry up, Negra. MERRY CHRISTMAS MOTHERFUCKERS Clear! Looks like they had her here. If she's alive, and they know who she is, they'll contact us soon. The person closest to her, right? Her mom, Teresa Lagos. I'll have her followed right away. No, not yet. We'll let Nuro's guys make their move first. Watch the neck. Alright. Do you mind, ladies? Has she calmed down? - A little. - Alright. Ana. How are we? Better? You can come to therapy three times a week. How about that? Do you really think that'll work? Why not? You think I'm one of those idiots? Whose emotions you toy with? By making them miserable, making them cry? Stripping them of their dignity? What makes you think you're any different? You're like anybody else. Vulnerable. You tried to kill yourself. - I'll give you some therapy. - Easy, easy. To make you stay out of my life! - Get her sedated. - Let's go. We've all got demons inside, and so do you! Your wife's phone. We tapped it. Thanks. I have to go back to Capadocia. I don't want to be alone. Don't worry honey. I'll be here. I want my sister back. Your phone's ready. - Got any Christmas change? - I don't have any, baby. - There you go. - Run! Run! Hello. Look at your watch, Teresa. You've got 24 hours to save your daughter's life. I tell you! It must really hurt to be backstabbed by everyone after being the baddest girl in the hood. And after what happened to your man. I wonder who whacked him? Probably those guys that brought you to Capadocia to search for the stash like an airport dog. Sniff over here, sniff over there. Sit there, bitch. I'll fuck them up. I'll get them for this. All of them. Negra for gay queen Negra for gay queen Are you done being crazy? Leave me alone. You should've looked cute with your feet hanging in the air. Move it. You're out for now. The house belongs to Maria Concepcion Soto, Nuro's grandma and... So that's who this is all about. Nuro, not my daughter. Your daughter is part of this, Teresa. Now I get it. Monse at Capadocia. Taking her out of the ambulance. Andrea was the bait. The scapegoat. Teresa, Nuro is a national priority. We understand your concern but... Concern? You practically delivered her to Nuro! Nobody wanted this to happen. An empty ambulance was supposed to be the decoy and another one with your daughter. The second one never showed up. Alright, alright, but you never seem to want to listen. Believe it or not, we're all concerned about her. You want Nuro? Go get him. I want my daughter, so don't count on me. I know what'll happen, they'll kidnap you, and try to terrify you as much as they can, until you decide to do everything they say. Please don't do that. Trust me, Teresa. You can't trust those guys. You won't save Andrea like that. Remember what you said, that she's probably dead anyway. Guess who will pay for those damn cops snooping around where they shouldn't. I knew nothing, I... Shut up and listen. We're patching up your kid, but guess what. I think we used up the antidote. Cut that shit out. Listen. - It's your fault she's in pain. - Please, don't hurt her. So... You're crying? What? Please. Please. You're begging? The model prison's warden is begging. Cut out the drama! Look, Teresa. It's your last chance. Yes, yes, yes. The clock's ticking. Why are you here, Carmen? I told you to stay away from us. The doctor brought you the results. Here. Fortunately his body got rid of most of the cocaine, but there's an intestinal complication, if he isn't operated on in less than 12 hours, that'll be the end. Alright. I'll tell the doctor to proceed. What about Lorena? Doesn't my daughter have a say in this? When did you resurrect your daughter? The minute I realized my grandkids live with an irresponsible cokehead. I'm taking the kids away from you. We'll see about that. In case you're interested, they could operate tomorrow at 9 AM. It's up to you, Patrick. Capadocia wishes you a happy Christmas dinner. So, crazy lady? Lorena is right, we can't smuggle any drugs without protection. We'll do it if that bitch refuses to. I don't know. What are you looking at, asshole? Lorena isn't keeping you girls happy? Scram, asshole. Shut your trap. Mind your own business. I always knew she'd give up. Shut up already. You're not in charge anymore. What are you going to do? Beg her to please give you your medicine? If I were you, I'd give her a good warning. In fact I'll do it if you like. For free. I can't stand the sight of that bitch. Pay attention. I'm saying this once. Spend the night at Capadocia. I could care less about your Christmas dinner, so write a letter to Santa or the Magi, or whoever the fuck you want to, but by yourself. We've got somebody in there watching every move you make. Do anything stupid, the slightest indiscretion, we'll know about it, and your kid will pay for it. Here's the deal. Monse for Andrea. We'll switch your daughter for Monse. You need to get her out of there without telling anyone. We don't care if you have to bribe somebody or run from the law, just get her out of there. You're the warden. In other so-called maximum security prisons dangerous prisoners have escaped. They let them out to kill people and come back. Use your power, Teresa. It's not that hard. Pay attention. Tomorrow, Christmas Day, at 10 o'clock, be outside with Monse, and don't screw up. We're watching you. Remember that. We're watching you. Capadocia wishes you a Merry Christmas. Are you ready? Listen, what you ask of me is impossible. I can't get a prisoner out of here. - Yes? - Mrs. Lagos? - Yes? - They' re operating on Juli. - What? - They just left for surgery. Who are they? The actors for the Nativity scene. Do I call it off? No, it's better to keep the women distracted. He was diagnosed with intestinal ischemia. I won't lie to you. It's very serious. Then I need to go to him and be there. Get me out of here. I can't get you out again. Why not? It's urgent. You're the warden. I'm sorry. You're sorry? You think I'll take that for an answer? Get me out or I'll tell Hernandez where we hid the drugs. Do as you wish. Do you expect me to wait here, while my kid could die during surgery? Alright, I think you'll understand this perfectly well. I'm expecting someone to call and tell me where to take Monse and rescue my kid, and I haven't a clue about how to get her out! Then we're in the same boat. Our first priority are our kids. I know how to get Monse out, if you take me with you. Yes? You're needed at the watchtower. Okay. Thanks. What did you say? It's not the main entrance. I know another way out. What way out? You'll find out if you take me with you. Take Monse with you, and drop me off near the clinic. Make up your mind. I'll be in your cell in five minutes. No tricks, Lorena. Don't linger. Guard! How is she? Much better, but I need to run some tests. Get ready to move her at any time. - What? Now? - That's an order. She's always in a bad mood recently. What's with her? I hope you thought it over and decided to help, because to save your kid we need to work together. They didn't phone Capadocia or your place, so they must've contacted you some other way. What's your rescue plan? Please don't become defensive. We're trying to put together a very sensitive operation. Just give us a hand here. Did they contact you? No, they haven't contacted me. Obstructing justice is a felony. I'm offering you the government's assistance, no strings attached, please, ma'am. I'd love to say otherwise, but I can't. However I know exactly what you goal is. Finding Nuro. National priority, right? But all I care about is my daughter. Merry Christmas, mom. Merry Christmas, honey. We need to talk. Can we talk, Santiago? We know they contacted Teresa. You need to be on my side. You know what'll happen if you don't. Teresa's going straight to the jaws of death. Forget about them. You have my word. Nuro isn't who I care most about. It's your kid. But you need to help me. What do you say? How can I help? That's a GPS tracker. You know what to do. Move it, ladies! Leave your cells now. In an orderly fashion. Move it. Move it, Negrita. Come on, get out, out! Out to the patio! Hair brushed, looking neat, maybe you'll learn something. Move it, move it. Move it, Lorena. Move it, princess, move it. That's it. Move it, this way. LEE go! So you don't forget why you're here. Go, go. Shepherds, shepherds, the Son of God is born. The Son of God is born. Get up, follow the star. - Are we going to Bethlehem? - No, to Iztapalapa. What's up, my shepherds? We're here to party. Come on. Gorgeous. Hi baby. There's enough to go around. Juli. Lorena, where is that damn secret exit? Juli. Guard. Take her to the infirmary. Come. Careful. Gate. I'm taking her this way. What's up baby? See anything you like? Why not stay and see what we got? I'll go, Teresa. You get Monse out. It's easier now that everyone's watching the show. Get her out. I'll do the rest. No, Santiago. If I don't go, the deal is off. I'll be there with you anyway. I'll do that, Claudia. Don't worry, ma'am. I'm coming too. I know where we're going and who we're meeting. Gate! Initiate tracking. Blanca, where are you? Blanca. I really hate these silly games. You startled me, idiot. Hi princess. Don't be afraid. Let's see. Let's get your heart going. Yeah, right, mamacita. We didn't do it last time, mamacita. - You never give up do you? - Never. That feels good. That guard ruined the farewell I had in store for you. Yeah, I know. So what happened? What's the big secret? They took you over there, and you got more time? You know why? Because of you. Yeah right, me. Remember your DEA buddy? Yes? The emerald dealer had him killed. Because you wouldn't fuck his brother. Come here bitch. - What are you going to do? - Cut you, you fucking bitch. Cut your throat, bitch. Let go, bitch, get your hands off of me. - What's this? - I'm worse than you. - Let go. - Okay. Okay. Take her to the hole. Move it! Move it! Not for long, you whore. Not for long. You fucking bitch. I don't think so, Blanca. Some guys are here for you. You're going to an American jail. What? You speak English, Blondie? - Move it. Move it. - Get your hands off of me! We lost track of Teresa. What now? Teresa, your kid has very little time left. It's a good thing you cut that deal. Give me the phone that kid gave you. - Chalo. - Yes, white girl? We're almost there. How much are you getting? Shut up, I don't feel guilty, so don't even go there. There's a life at stake. Two. Two lives. Your daughter's and the one I just got. So don't get me nervous, if all this goes well, you'll have your kid and Nuro will have his wife. You told me to trust you. That this would work! - I need you to leave. - Let go of me. - Calm down, calm down. - Take a look at this. - The woods south of town. - Stick to the plan. - How is she? - She's not responding. What? Lorena. Lorena. Wake up. Come here, Monse. Andrea walks too. We do things my way. We're not in your jail. Here you're just another dumb broad. Nuro, let Andrea leave with her mom. And I'll go with you. Don't run or I'll shoot. Friends forever, right? Remember our deal. Get that bitch! Police! Move in! Hands on your head! Sir. Yes? Daddy? I'm sorry, Blanca. They got my number from my friend's phone. They had me cornered. What do you mean? What friend? Are you sticking to your story? It's her. She forced me to. She threatened to kill me if I didn't do it. I acted under duress, and I can prove it. You fucking bitch! Let go! Let go! I'll get you for this, you slut! You messed with the wrong person. - Stay still! - Let go of me! This is so sad. You're the only one that can't see me. The only one I care about. You know how long I've waited for you to see me, hear me? An eternity. My sweet Colombian. Why can't I kiss you like I used to? It's mine. Ours. Say it. Say it. Say it, even if it's a lie. Where I'm at, truth and lies are the same thing. Help! Somebody help me please! I don't feel well! Inmate Andrea Marin Lagos. Gate. Gate. Go to the checkup room. I think she didn't want to die. I guess it's for her kids. Get some rest, doctor. I'll call if something comes up. Yes I should. Thanks.
