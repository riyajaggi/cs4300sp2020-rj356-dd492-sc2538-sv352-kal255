 - Well? - No. - Are you coming? - No. - Come on. - Not tonight. Satisfaction guaranteed. It's your loss. Alright, you're not my type anyway. What are you doing here José? I need that textbook. Tell your teacher I'll get it for you next week. Alright. Don't be mad at me.

 What's up José? You get cuter every day. Stop it Rosa. Take José home. The cops! Take my son home. José, José, José. José. José, José. Let go of me you bastard. I've been waiting for you. We can't forget June 10th. Right. - Did you bring flowers? - Of course. Has your doctor said something about your cough? I'm fine José. Please don't start. It's bronchitis. That's what the doctor said. I'm taking my medication.

 You're lying as usual. Priests never lie. Don't you know it's a sin? Here's my mom. You've been in here long enough Lorena, get out. This one's going to hospital. Lorena. Lorena, Lorena. I like you now that you got rid of Bambi. Don't forget about me, honey. Come, you need a bath. These cavities on each side can hold approximately 25 ecstasy pills and 50 of the other stuff. In other words, twice as much in each of these great bras. Not bad, right? We could cover the entire Spanish market in a year, as long as you keep up with demand. Quantity is not a problem. - Great. - Don't worry about it. But how do you plan to distribute the drugs in Spain? We did a market research. She is an internationally acclaimed designer, and the fact that our inmates assemble the items is a plus. So here's the deal. We ship the goods out, you unload at Barcelona, where your people switch the contents, and ship the bras to the stores where they sell like hotcakes, and we rake in the profits. What about you, Cristóbal? What do you think? You don't seem too convinced. Of course he's convinced. I already told you, right boss?, that Carlos is an expert in design drugs, so we couldn't be in better hands. But once... you're in... you're of no use to us... on the outside. It was nice meeting you, Cristóbal. - I'll see you out. - Sure. Are we going to have a drink or what? Remember the day you stole my consecrated wine? Of course I remember. My but ached so much I couldn't sit for two weeks. Good-for-nothing. You still find it funny. I had to say evening Mass with grape juice, while you and your buddies got drunk in the backyard. How could we get drunk? That wine was almost like water. Try this mescal. I just got it from Oaxaca. Have a shot. It's exquisite. We didn't have such a bad time after all, did we? Not bad at all Father. I am going away for a while, José. What? I'm going on a retreat. I need to exorcize quite a few demons. That's what those good-for-nothing priests do. You know you need to work with the people against Satan, instead of praying to a wall in a dark room. I guess I've slacked off a little. I had to tell you so you won't come looking for me, because you won't find me. Is everything okay Father? Sure and please don't start interrogating me, or you'll ruin my mescal. Tell me something that will make me happy. How are things with your lawyer friend? I think he has acid reflux. - Burián said so. - Right. Who's looking after him today? He's staying with Jacinta. Poor thing. I'll stay with him. And who's going to school? Jacinta? Yes. Hello. Is it time for the baby's drops? Yes, is that why you called? Lorena's to be sentenced today for killing Bambi. So the judge finally had his way. I'll call you later. That's it. Let's go. Are you taking the bag or what? All the way down the red line to the gate. Welcome to Capadocia. Move it. Poor Bambi didn't have a soul in the entire world. Her family rejected her even now that she is dead. What was Bambi's real name, Colombian? I really don't know. I don't know. I ate her so many times and I don't even know her name? Yolanda. Eat something child. That was Bambi's problem. She never had anyone. No wonder she was like that. It's just not right. Nobody answered the messages they left her family. As soon as Lorena gets out of solitary, she will have Bambi's bitches to deal with. If nobody claims her body, she'll end up in an unmarked, common grave, like a dog. Wait a minute. Tell Bambi's bitches to watch it. If Lorena was capable of killing Bambi... She is not the same anymore. There she comes. Ojitos, take this one to Sofía's cell. And take the pillow out before she kills somebody. Move it you two. Number 27 is your suite, ladies. Tell that Indian what the rules are. Only the jailers tell them what the rules are. Shut that gate. We are surrounded by some very bad people. You're scared, aren't you? You can have any bed you want. We'll get along just fine. You don't know what I'm saying. I will help you. I'll teach you Spanish. What a drag. This is such a drag. Your therapy is of no use to me. I think you're the one that needs to see me. Can I call you José, Doc? Here's the deal. One thing for another. Let's play "forfeits". If you get rid of yourjacket, what do I get rid off? Your fear. I can't. Are you here to punish me too? I'm not here to judge you. I've heard that before. Men fear the real whores. The ones that really enjoy it terrify you guys. What about you? Are you scared of us? Of us loose women? The ones that give in to our lust? The ones that enjoy all kinds of penetration? Tell me Doctor. We've been through this, Zaide. It didn't work before and it never will. So you are scared of us, you poor thing. But why? What's your story with us whores, Doc? Repe. Pepe. Come Pepe. I brought you some meatballs. Sit down. When is Mom coming home? Very soon. You said so two weeks ago. Stop it. Stop whining. We have to be patient. Yes this is your home too Andrea, I just don't have time. That is nothing new, dad, my sister and I are accustomed to it. Growing up like trees, all by ourselves. It hurts me to hear you say that. You could've fooled me. You have time for the woman in the magazine. It's not like what you heard in the press. I'm not judging you dad, all I ask of you is, please don't treat me like a stranger while I'm here. Of course I won't. You can stay as long as you need to, all I ask of you is to make up with mom. I can't do that, dad. Mom doesn't understand me and besides, I feel so alone around her. You are not alone Andrea. You'd better get going. It's late. - Teresa. - Yes, Isabel? Are you coming back? No, I'm working on the case of Guadalupe the Indian. Be nice to her. Yes of course. No problem. It would be better if you came back. The inmates seem to trust you more than they do me. And as I said, I'll quit if you want me to. Do you really think that's why I'd come back? Admit it, you just can't stand to work with me because of your husband's affair with me, which I find ridiculous. You are right, if you put it that way. It does sound stupid, but you have nothing to do with it. And thanks for offering to sacrifice yourself like that. Don't worry about it boss. Your company will keep growing with our new business. I never thought I'd be involved in drug dealing. I didn't say that. These aren't a bunch of murderous Indians. He's a nice white boy. He could pass for one of these executives' son. It's easy for you to hide drugs in those bras and panties, when I'm the one sticking my head out. I'm the CEO and I'll go to jail if anything goes wrong. That's the beauty of it, boss. The designer is responsible for all the clothes that's assembled at Capadocia since she is the owner, and the Governor is responsible for whatever goes on there. Everything is going to be just fine. Who would ever suspect any wrongdoing with clothes coming from a private, government approved prison? Think of all the money you'll make, boss, millions. Your new mom? Your new mom? You were conceived inside of me. It's that simple. Now you have a new mom? Am I replaceable as a mom too? Or as a wife? Or as a lover? Or a friend? Nothing matters anymore. Lorena. They're here to take you to the courtroom. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Right now you'd be getting ready to go home, and now you'll get forty more years, I'm sorry. Stop crying. Everybody that has ever loved me ended up dead. I don't love you, Colombian. I see. I'm such a fool. Maybe Bambi's the only one that loved me. And now she'll be buried in a common grave, because nobody claimed her body, and she's rotting at the morgue like a dog. These cases have one thing in common, people that acted on an impulse. These were decent, law-abiding people all their lives, until that precise moment when they broke the law, and turned into criminals. I want you to pick out one of these cases, and tell us how you would go about defending her, focusing on what triggered that impulsive behavior. Alright? Thank you. You know what my impulsive reaction would be? I'm in a hurry Daniel. I'd grab you by the neck and give you a piece of my mind. This is what your kind of impulses did to me. - What are you talking about? - About using people like me. It's a shame things can't be different between us. Don't tell me he's better in bed than me. You don't care if your kids see you together. Stop it Daniel. I've had enough of this. Don't look for me, spy on me or talk to me. And above all, stay out of my private life. - Just like that? - That's right. "There are no messages in this folder." I told you he wouldn't answer. He's so jealous. At least you tried. It's his loss if he won't see you again. Forget about him. You can still count on Bobby to lose your virginity. - It's not about that, Patricia. - Okay. Lorena Lucía Guerra Masiel is found not guilty of manslaughter in the case of Maite Cedeńo Calderón. She was found not guilty and is therefore a free woman. For the crime of first degree murder committed against Aurelia Sosa, the defendant Lorena Lucía Guerra Masiel, is found guilty and sentenced to thirty years in prison, pursuant to the corresponding section of the penal code. Look, isn't that divine? Two stories, an ocean view, and a spot at the marina in case we get a boat. - Yes, that is beautiful. - It is, isn't it? Mrs. Lagos. Justice is a very funny thing, don't you think? You ruined your good name for that killer, what a shame. Wait. Why did you do it Lorena? There's nothing to discuss. We can do something if it was in self defense. If you want to do something, get Bambi a decent burial. I killed her. It's over. What's wrong? Why are you crying? It's nothing. I'm just a little emotional. Continue. I can't. I'm here making love to you, and then you'll be all alone. I can't do it, I just can't. Don't worry about me. I just want you to be okay. Don't let go. Call the Colombian. The boss wants you. Even from the grave, Bambi had her way. She'll be buried tomorrow. Really? Where? In a regular cemetery first thing tomorrow. Nobody's going to the burial, but it's not a common grave. I wanted you to know that. Thanks. They're burying Bambi. - They're burying Bambi. - They're burying Bambi. They're burying Bambi. Don't tell me he's better in bed. Hi dad. Hello. Teresa. Hello stranger. What did I do? Have you given the baby his drops? Yes I did. What time do you go out for bread? What bread? Come on honey. José, Ruth and the baby are asleep. - See you in ten minutes. - No José. I mean it. You are so stubborn. Mom. - How are you? - Fine. - Are you eating properly? - Yes. - Really? - Are you coming home? Go get a quesadilla. I'll be right over. What did they tell you, Pancho? We need 5000 pesos to get you out of here. What? Where will I get all that money? Give it to them, Pancho. I'll pay you back little by little. I'm not running a charity here, honey. My job was to give you the message. Let me know when you get the money. Pancho. Please wait. My son is all alone. Please help me out here. I swear I'll pay you back. Please help me. - I don't have it. - Pancho. Come on José. Say goodbye to your mom. You can't give up now. Many of those women have a chance. Yes but it's very frustrating when it doesn't happen. Look at what Lorena did. What Lorena did is of no importance. These women have families and children. And a future. What's the matter? What is it? Nothing. You'd be another person if we had met 30 years ago. Thirty years ago you were a kid. Amanda would be alive. My God. A woman of your convictions can't give up like that. What Lorena and Amanda did is of no importance. All that matters is, what we can do out in the streets. Such as make sure justice is done. You're good at that. Are those pajamas? How is my wife? Just fine. "Get me out or I'll kill myself. Carla." Did you really tell him you'd kill yourself? I tried everything else you told me. Now he'll get me out of here. I know. I bet you he got a lawyer to drop the charges. I hope so. You'll see. You're bad! Me kill myself? I'd have to be nuts. Why are you leaving? The baby won't be here forever. He can stay until he's 30 for all I care. Have you seen my black sweater? You're breaking mom's heart. That's too bad because I could care less. Besides, dad and I get along just fine. Are you going away forever? Put that baby in bed and give me a hand. I'm trying to avoid mom. I'll get the rest later. Daniel. Hi. Did you get my e-mail? Yes. Are you going on a trip? No, I moved in with my dad. I came to get my things. I'm so glad you came to see me. Right. I'm glad I did. We can hang out if you want. Where's your mom? She can go to hell. She finally got a new baby and a new boyfriend. Follow me. Where are we going? Just follow me. Let me close the door real quick. Hello. Hi Cristóbal. This is the Colombian. I told you not to call me. I know but I need a favor. Come on, for old time's sake? Alright, what do you want? I need to be at my woman's funeral tomorrow. She'll be buried in a regular cemetery. What time? Tomorrow morning, and I need to be with her. - I'll take care of it. - You'd better. I've never done any of this before. I've longed for this moment. - Are you nervous? - Yes. No. Take it easy. Just let go. Switch the lights off. Hello. Teresa. Andrea is gone. Gone where? I'm glad you came. I didn't know what to do. I can't believe the governor's child is missing, and he doesn't know what to do. None of this would be happening if we were back together. Looking after our kids. Bringing them up properly. Andrea's defiance has a lot to do with our divorce. Where were you, Andrea? Couldn't you call and let us know you're okay? Where were you? Out screwing. - See you. - Thanks. Hello. She's back. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Hello. Andrea, were you really... Really... Of course not dad. I just said that to bug mom. So this is how you drive your mom crazy. You either behave or I'm sending you off to boarding school. Would somebody explain why you guys had me, if you didn't want me? Please don't start with that again. No, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being so stupid. I just realized how very convenient it's been, sending your mom you guys' tuition fees, and phoning once in a while to see how you're doing, and saying I'm glad you're fine. But now that you've moved in with me... I'm in your way, right? No, that's not it, honey. That's not it at all. I don't know what to do with you. I don't know how. You need to make up with you mom. No dad, I hate her. I don't ever want to hear you say that again. She gave birth to you. She's always been there for you. Don't say things you don't mean. Hate is a very strong word. How can you stand up for her when she kicked you out? One day she decided she had had enough of you. It's not like that, Andrea. Do not blame your mom. A marriage is between two people, and sometimes... you hurt each other. What hurts you so much, dad? What did she do to you? Nothing. I was the one that let her down. Teresa asked me to leave, because I was stupid enough to... Because your mom saw me... with another woman. I'm the one that screwed things up. And if Teresa hasn't forgiven me yet, she has every right not to. Now that you know the truth, I hope all your ridiculous resentment just stops. How are you José? Come in. Did you forget you asked me over? I'm sorry. Last night was just awful. Bad news? Not really, Andrea didn't come back home, and Santiago and I waited up for her. Why don't we talk about work instead? Sure, the husband of the woman Guadalupe allegedly killed showed up at last. - Coffee? - Sure. I'll get it. Have a seat. - Why is dad leaving, mom? - Because he has to. - But you're kicking him out. - He's leaving right now. Hi Andrea. Where were you? I haven't been able to reach you. Were you crying? Of course not. It's quite the opposite. I'm very happy. It doesn't seem so. A lot of things have happened to me, Patty. Dad just told me he cheated on mom, and I've hated her all this time. Really? And I slept with Daniel last night. Really? Really. And it was wonderful. I felt things I had never felt before. Now you two will be much closer. I just want to be with him, and do it a million times. I love him. I love him. What was it like? How did it all start? I have something to do before class. See you later. Yes Andrea? How are you mom? I'm here at work. I need to talk with you. I'm serious. So do I. Urgently. Why don't you come over tonight? Alright. Listen, I'm sorry. Tell us what happened. I was abroad all this time. I came back a couple of days ago, and I heard what happened. It happened a week ago. Didn't anyone contact you? Didn't you call your wife? The District Attorney's assistant should be doing the interview. My client is the victim here. His wife was murdered while he was abroad. With you perhaps? Excuse me? Another comment like that from Mr. Burián, and I'll have to ask him to leave the room. Continue, sir. I'm going to miss you, you hear? There's picture of the Blessed Virgin, to accompany you on your trip my love. Lorena Guerra, there's someone to see you. We'll meet again. I know Guadalupe did not kill your wife. Then please find the killer. Nobody suffers her loss more than I do. It must be terrible. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Excuse me. Those two are in a torrid love affair. - Are you sure? - Yes. - What a bastard. - I know. I need you to sign the divorce petition. I don't need to do this. I could get a divorce at any time without telling you anything. But I want to do things right. You do? You should've thought of that before. I'm moving out of town. I'm taking the kids away from the Federal District, to a school where nobody knows them, with nobody to remind them where you are, or what you did. We could take the case to court, if that is what you want. - That won't be necessary. - Good. - I'll sign. - Please. Goodbye Lorena. Will I ever see my boys again? Never again. Never? What a word. Help them forget all about me and start a new life. I'm dead as far as they're concerned. You'll be fine. I'll be fine. A piece of advice. If you plan to cheat on your wife, don't do it at home. Much less with her best friend. This is the last time you can pay me in pesos. I need dollars next time, because that's the good stuff. - It's the last time. - I hope so. - Me too. - Take me to Bambi's cell. Thanks for letting the Colombian go to her woman's burial. I made an exception and I warn you, it's the last time, at least while I am here. You're not going anywhere. Now that Teresa's gone, only you can run the prison. Teresa will be back. This place was her idea and we need her here. Just a minute. Let's not jump to conclusions. We're here to make you an offer that would benefit everybody. Federico, please explain it to her. We want to start exporting. Shipments will go directly from here to Spain, and from there to the rest of Europe. Does Santiago know about this? We need his permission. We're depending on you to convince him with your female charm. And Teresa? We don't need Teresa, she quit already. We need you to run Capadocia, and Santiago's permission to do business. We're going to update the equipment and... Let's get one thing clear, Cristóbal. I haven't the slightest interest in being Capadocia director. I could get Santiago to authorize the operation, since it could benefit the women. There are lots of benefits such as the overtime, which means more money for their families. Exactly, think about it. Politically speaking, this is a huge break for you. You'd be running a prison where the women live like royalty. Just imagine. So think about it. You're a smart woman. So think about it. It's business as usual, Lorena. We need to pay the boss for all those drugs. You sell it, before one of these women do. I can't see you now Isabel. Andrea is staying with me and I have a lot of work to do. It's not a personal matter. Cristóbal was here. It's about Capadocia and it's urgent. I'll see you tomorrow then. I have to go. Take care. - Hi. - Hi. Teresa, I'd like to fix things between us as best I can. I'm here to say a few things to avoid any confusion. First of all, I'm going back to Capadocia. That's great news. Secondly, we are never ever getting back together. That won't solve the crisis the girls are going through. I don't think I need to hear number three. And thirdly, these are the divorce papers we've putt off for so long. You just need to sign. We were going to get married. I had my engagement ring and everything. His name is Gerardo. We loved each other a lot. Return to your cells. Don't you feel well? Do you want me to take you to the doctor? I'm not sure. I think I'm pregnant. You too, Sofia. Go to bed. Wait. Carla has been released. So, Carla, we'd be heading for another gate, if your husband hadn't cut a deal with me. Hello. - Dr. Burián? - Yes? Father Agustín is very ill. We need you to come here. How bad is it? He is very ill, doctor. He is dying. Rlease come. I got you something. - You did? - Yes, open it. I have a lot of hope. You should too. I want you out of here soon. I have no idea where you got your brains, with a nitwit mom like me. That's right. Son... I want you to stay in school, and make a huge success of yourself. But to do that, you need someone to look after you, and I can't anymore. Mom, don't start. Listen to me, son. Look. I don't think you... I don't want you to be all by yourself, out there like a stray dog people feel sorry for, with nobody to care for you. So... I want you to look for a guy who will look after you. But you're getting out of here. No buts. Just listen to me. When he hears you're my son, he will understand. Are you Father Agustín? Yes my son. Should I hear your confession? I am Amanda's son. My mom said that... She died a few days ago and before she did... Amanda is dead? Yes. She said that you... I'd better go. No, wait, wait. Have a seat. Did your mom tell you I'm your dad? In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen. He didn't want you to see him like this. He loved you so. Your sister will be here soon. We need to pamper her to see if she'll come back home. I hope so, although I needed some time away from her. We're going to talk about some girl stuff. Are we going to stay up late? No we're not. You are going to sleep while I talk to your sister. Hello. Your dad? My God. Please calm down. Can I call you back in a minute? - Hi. - Hi. - I cooked dinner. - Lord have mercy on us. - Idiot. - Shut up. Hi honey. I'm so glad you came. Hello. Don't cry. I'd love someone to cry for me one day. I care a lot about you, did you know that? Try to understand, mom, it's tough to be you guys' child. How can you expect all your lies not to drive me nuts? I just wanted to save you the pain, and all the disappointment. I was disappointed anyway. Now I'm not interested in getting married, or having kids, or any of that. But I want to talk about something else. About what? About growing up, mom. I'm not a virgin anymore. But it was great and I'm very happy. So who... Who did you do it with? With Daniel, your student.
