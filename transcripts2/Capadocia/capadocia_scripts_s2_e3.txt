 TAKE THIS CHALICE FROM ME Turn that crap off. I said turn that crap off. Can I come? I want to go to the barrio too. No way kid. The other question is why do we commit crimes? It may seems absurd to ask you that question, but we commit crimes for many reasons. Out of love. Out of passion, out of vengeance or as a means of escape.

 Lots of times we commit crimes to do justice. My job here is to guide you along in the process of recognizing what brought you here. Not for the system or your victims to forgive you, but for you to forgive yourselves. Let your fucking mother forgive you. Be quiet. Be quiet! I need you to cooperate with Dr. Molina so she can do her job. Thanks Teresa. That's all girls, thank you. Shaving your head is a good idea. Maybe now we'll see those bright ideas.

 You're nuts. What about those jerks? Leave them to me. What are you looking at? Your Cuban Mafia is negotiating with the bosses. Right. Fuck them. Here, asshole, you negotiate with the gang. We already gave them all the money we had. We paid those guys... Shut up bitch. To take us to Miami. The bosses are keeping the money, and there's nothing left for the barrio. If they want these Cubans back alive, the ones that want to go to Miami, the sons of bitches will have to pay, to show them what divine clay we're made of. Make sure she does her part. I can't open warden Lagos' office for you. I'm not authorized to. I don't care who you are. I go by the book. I'm in charge of security here. My orders are to search the place. And you are? Officer Ana Moreno, Captain Victor Hernandez. Special federal agent. A murder was committed here, with you in charge of security. Open up. Are those files open? No they're... I don't know. I need copies of all your computer files, including inmate files, all the guards, and the entire staff. Come with me, officer. I want the entire place searched. Security code 070. Cut off the air and water supply and clear all cells. I'm on my way. That's the victim's cell. Search it. - Hortensia. - Yes sir. I found this. Drugs. These are our inmates. What's with you? Why are you so scared? What's with you? Dominga. Take her away. That's Andrea Marin Lagos, daughter of Santiago Marin and the warden, that's her cell. Search it. - Yes sir. Why? I found something. What? No, that's not mine. It's not mine. It's not. No, that's not mine. She was killed with a knife like this one, from the autopsy report. What have you done, Andrea? That's it. You're screwed. That's not mine. I did nothing. I need an office to take her statement. - Second floor. - Bring her. No, leave her alone. Magos, I did nothing. Tell them. I did nothing. Nothing! I did nothing, nothing! Let go of me. Let go of me! I did nothing. I need Diane Brighton's extradition urgently. The American Embassy is concerned about her safety. I demand that you get her out of there, and let me protect Capadocia. I already did. Send me your confirmation. What about that woman, Nuro's wife? - She'll be out soon, - That could be too late. What's wrong Teresa? We're here about the singer's murder. I suppose you've got a lot of information about that. All I know, Mr. Attorney General, is that she was dead before she got to Capadocia. She's part of a conspiracy to stop Santiago's presidential ambitions. They killed her to silence her. It's as simple as that. That's the unofficial version if I'm not mistaken. Very well Teresa. I promise to get to the bottom of all this, no matter what and no matter who's involved. - It wasn't my daughter. - We'll prove that. She didn't kill her, and she could be next. I want her protected, and the State's assistance. And yes, get to the bottom of this no matter who falls. You gave me your word now keep it. Yes I understand. Thank you. They're blaming my sister, aren't they? No, honey, come here. Come here. Nothing is going to happen to your sister. We won't allow it. She'll be just fine. Hey. Who's that? - Who is she? - Probably spying on us. - What? - What? What? Who sent you here, girl? Nobody sent me. I came here on my own. I'm Noemi. What do you want? Nothing. I just wanted to see the barrio. Yeah? I want to join 18. I want to be part of your gang. - Why? - What's that? My vida loca. You've got to be kidding me. Noemi is your name? That's right. Don Federico Marquez sent you this. The same pro that did those scandal tapes did this. You know what to do. Tell Federico Marquez Victor Hernandez is also a pro. We're taking a huge risk. Don't be afraid. Nothing's going to happen. My money. You'll be paid if you get the job done. Any questions? Take your shirt off. - Do I put it here? - Yes. Sit down and sit up nice and straight. We need a passport look. Listen, we only... Shut up, idiot. I'm not even here, okay? Don't even talk to me. Be quiet, okay? Sit up straight. Shut up. My family is over there, in Miami. Shut up, idiot. You just don't get it, do you? Shut up, idiot. Just shut up. I want a passport look. - Please. - I want a passport look. Well, well. It's a match. You're in trouble. Did you kill her? Sewing shift two starts now. Sewing shift two starts now. He's been interrogating her for three hours. Why wasn't I informed? - I don't know. - Where? - Cubicle 3. - Thanks. You got back at her for shooting your dad. There was a knife in your mattress. How long did you plan your revenge? You can talk to me. It'll be easier if you cooperate. You could do less time. I'm not talking without my attorney. Who are you, and why are you here? Special Federal Agent Victor Hernandez. I'm investigating the crime that was committed here. What were you doing with my daughter? She is the prime suspect of murdering Brenda Yamilet. We believe this is the murder weapon. Excuse me. "A sign of the end of time "shall be the arrival of a false prophet. "For behold, "Satan will cast several of you into prison "so that you may be tested. "And your tribulations shall last ten days. "And those angels were unleashed... What is it? "who were ready for the hour, day, month and year. Shut up you crazy bitch! In order to exterminate one half of mankind... I pass. Okay. I want to be initiated. I want to be initiated. To get into Barrio 18, apart from being initiated, you need to rape, and kill some jerk. It's not easy. Once you're in there's no getting out. Who says I want to get out? They framed our daughter. That cop will bury her. No Teresa. He can't do that. We are lawyers. We believe in the justice system. Justice is for the powerful. They're going to sacrifice our daughter. I won't let you, even for a single instant, lose faith. Not in us. I won't let you give in, or give up or doubt even, because I know we're getting our child out. That's more like it. Whores. My grandma would've said, "Flush them down the drain". It's better to inspire fear than pity. I hope you didn't screw up with that cop. I'm not like you or your killer husband. You're right. We're not the same. You're an aristocrat. I'm a peasant, and it's a lot of work harvesting and scraping plants to make gum, and all that for what? So they can take it over the sierra in soda trucks? To make somebody rich? They call it corn, but grandma and I, we don't. We call it what it is, poppy, and when I get out and have Nuro's daughter, that's what I'll call her, Amapola. "Famous singer murdered in Capadocia". It's done, we even have the shrink's files. And Negra? Negra? She did a great job. She's still cooperating. She helped frame Andrea Marin. That's done. Will that close the case, Federico? Let's see. There's a new guy in Capadocia, a fed by the name of Victor Hernandez. He has access to any prison he wants. Is he on our payroll? Well, no, not yet. But not to worry, we're investigating him. Here. Negra's dough too. Hers too? Anytime, sir. With your leave. Did you love her? Well, yes. Yes I loved her. But I was more scared of her. Very scared. And I still am. But she's dead Consuelo. She can't touch you. No, she's alive and in here. They've seen her. Who saw her? Calm down. No, no, please. I have to go now. - Take it easy. - Please. Go ahead, Consuelo. I need more drugs. These crazy women need their stuff to stay sane. Calm down. That new cop doesn't know about you yet. Finally. He's cute, right? But I'm loyal. You owe me. I'd take you out if we were free... gorgeous. I'd get you a bunch of flowers and then I'd jump all over you. I'd take you somewhere where we'd be alone. To close our eyes and dance, slowly just you and me, no orchestra. You'll get old. What's this? What's going on here? What? Go back to your room. I can't stand you! So leave me. I'd be a lot better off alone. Getting high all the time. I don't have anything to explain to you Susana. Dad, my little brother... Dad. I promised you nothing. Yes baby, I heard you. Go back to your room. Juli, come. You're not their mom so don't act like you are. Go to hell and get as high as you want. Get out! Go see what's wrong with your brother. Come Juli. Gate. Hi honey. Andrea, have you any idea how that knife got here? Are you blaming me? No Andrea, please. - They kill women here. - Be quiet. - They do drugs. - Calm down. And lots of other things you don't know about, and now you're blaming me for this? Shut up! That's why you're here. Because of your temper. Gate. You're good to go. Everybody's looking for these Cubans. They're even on the news. We can only do business with the bosses. If they don't pay up in time, we kill them. I don't want to know. - What about the visas? - Tomorrow. Can I go now? I need money for bread and milk and... And your mom's beer? And a new doll for Noemi? Okay, okay. So? - So what? - You want to be initiated? Sure. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen! What's so funny, stupid? I'm happy. I'm happy because I'm in your gang now. Listen. La Kapi. Welcome to Barrio 18. Now comes the worst part. Welcome to Capadocia. Ruth chose that one because it looks like a bikini. I hate Sundays. I didn't kill her, dad. I do admit though, that I felt like it, but I didn't kill her. You believe me, right? Of course I believe you honey. Who's looking after you? Lorena and Magos. Do as they say. Please stay out of an adult conversation. Mom still burns the hotcakes. Now I'm really scared, dad. How are you? One half of me is okay but not the other. But that's enough to get you out of here. I'm done. Plus his woman left him. - She did? - Tossed him like a used napkin. Patrick's still snorting coke. I do the best I can for the kids, but Patrick's a mess, a huge mess. So many things happen when a woman ends up here. We're like the foundation, when we break, all hell breaks loose. I'm covering for you. Don't worry about your kids. I look after them. I need to see him. I'll Ask Teresa for help, a visit, something. Well done, Negrita, well done. Don't start flashing money around. Wait a while to spend it. And don't go to a bank no matter what. You think I'm that stupid? You do? Well fuck you. Say thanks to Federico Marquez. Sure. I can't see how a classy woman like you distributes that garbage in your own country. I'm innocent. They'll decide that over there. Here's the extradition papers. Liliana, send a guard. Counselor, let me make a phone call. I have a right to. This isn't a high security jail, but it is for you. Just one call. Take her to solitary. But why? To keep you alive. Yes man. I have them. I have all of them. No, no, you don't get it. We brought these fucking Cubans from Merida, and if you don't pay up, not one of them leaves alive. What are you doing here? Go home. Those fucking Miami mobsters already know that. You've got 8 hours. You know where. We checked the tape. It seems to be real. The knife was in Andrea's mattress. And she tested positive for drugs. Tell me the truth, Victor. What do you think? I have my doubts sir. But the facts point at Andrea Marin. It sure looks like a conspiracy. What the hell are we going to do? How are you princess? Not good. Something happened. - Are you okay? - No, I need you to come. What's wrong Sofia? Can't you talk? I can't talk. You startled me Negra. What is it Negra? - Calm down girl. - What? You suck at singing. What did you tell the shrink? Nothing. I need you to come here. Please come. Okay, okay. Good evening. Good evening. Captain Victor Hernandez. I know who you are. You were at my prison. Your prison or your business? You seem to be very interested in expanding your project. Ten more prisons are big business. That is precisely why I'm so interested in clearing up that girl's murder. So you won't mind answering a few questions. Yes, Mr. Attorney General, the feds are taking her away as we speak. - Yes sir. - Move it. Here I am, sweetie. Let's get going. What time is it? Get dressed. Open up, dummy. This is one classy drug lord. I can see he's studied, traveled, and well-read too. What? He's no drug lord. No? What then? Is he Marin's grandson? Marin doesn't have any grandkids. Now you know I always keep my word. Your little present must be back in her cell at 5. Good night. Have fun. Dressed or undressed? Whatever you say. I could careless. You're so hot. You're a gorgeous woman. Having second thoughts already? Not like this. This is too real for a night like this. Federico, get her out of here. Sorry, I didn't mean to ruin your evening. All my life I was convinced you needed to have a hot hot body, huge boobs, and all that stuff, but no, they only use you and then kick you out. Beauty is a curse. Tell me what you did. You don't have to. I sold out my husband to the DEA. Why did you rat on your husband? Because the son of a bitch did me a favor. One day I told him something I didn't really mean, one of those things you say when you get mad, I told him I wanted my parents dead. And the son of a bitch killed them. He killed my parents. Poor thing. He even showed me a snapshot of them dead. You don't do that shit. You pay dearly for that shit. So what's the guys name? Hey. You ask a lot of questions. Stop it. - Hey. - What? - What the hell? - What are you talking about? - Noemi. - She asked for it herself. Get the guys together in pairs. Okay? I'm going out there alone. If they go crazy, we waste them. They go crazy, we go crazy. Look what I got you. Where did they take you? Out. Was he worse than Cristobal? Yes, worse. Poor thing. What do you want? Out, out. It's okay. It's not 500. It's 250. You need to work for us to stay in business. I don't think so. You have nothing. No clout, no power. Besides, you don't control the area from here to the north border. Look, let me take the Cubans to Miami, and we'll do business as usual. Here's the deal. As planned. That's it. That's it. You're all dead. - I don't give a fuck. - Don't kill me please. Noemi. I'll give you anything you want. Please don't kill me. We'll get the money. I swear. My family is in Miami. Come on. We need to fight for the barrio, right? Show them who we are. Make them respect us. - Please no, no. - Whose balls are these? Here's a piece of info. The 18 gang is in Buenavista. The Kapi. Welcome to la vida loca. Noemi, sister, come. The cops are coming. We need to go home. Take it easy. - Freeze! - Freeze, bitch! Don't move, asshole. Don't move. Freeze. Police. Move, move, move! Run, go home. Go home. - Freeze. Police. - Get on the ground. Sir, sir, it was her. I saw her. She killed the Cuban. They kidnapped me. Look what they did to me. It was her. I saw her kill the Cuban. I saw her. Where's he going? Captain. Sir. Thanks for the outfit. So. The lady says I'm her servant. No. No, Nuro. Can we talk? Can we make some kind of deal? We already had a deal. Let me go. You have no idea what you're getting into. Don't be stupid, Nuro. I'll do my time, but I'll get out, and the market will be all yours. All yours. It's all mine anyway. With or without you. That's not your problem. You ruined my wedding. My wife is in jail. My cute baby Montse. You're such an ingrate. What can I do for you? What can I do for you? I'll do anything. Anything? Are you sure? The thing is I don't like you. Excuse my accent, but fuck you. This just got here. What is it? What is it? The summons to Andrea's hearing. For the crimes of kidnapping, human trafficking, arms trafficking, criminal conspiracy, premeditated murder, drug trafficking and forging official documents, Janet Maria Gomez Herrera is sentenced to serve... Fourth pad. Write your name and sign. Give her a box. Put your personal effects in there. Fourth pad, stupid. You'll be given a uniform. Then you get to see the doctor. And I need to take pictures of those crappy tattoos. This too? Yes? That too. An investigation is hereby officially opened for the murder of Brenda Yamilet Sanchez Espino, for which Andrea Marin Lagos has been formally charged as the person responsible for said crime. I didn't kill her. Dad, I didn't kill her. I swear. I swear. I did nothing. I didn't kill anybody. Mom, I didn't kill her. I didn't kill her.
