 BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT I'll kill you if they don't let her in. I told you to hurry. You should've gotten up earlier. Sure, I didn't have to work until 3 AM while your royal highness was fast asleep. It's not my fault your boss exploits you. Why doesn't this fucker step on it? Stop cursing in front of the kid. She doesn't understand. Right honey? Right daddy, it's okay. - Stop. - What?

 We'll miss our stop. Tell him to stop. Stop. Be good, baby. Hello. - Sorry, I can't let her in. - Please let my kid in. It's the third time she's late. Please let her in. I'm so sorry. I have a supervisor. Come, baby. First thing tomorrow, they're taking La Santita to a mental hospital. Who examined her? I don't think that's a good idea. There isn't much more I can do for her. It took me months to convince the judge

 that due to her condition she should never have been convicted. La Santita has no one to look after her, and the woman that helped her fled after being charged with fraud. You think an autistic person will be better off in a mental hospital? I don't know, Valeria. I know the doctor. I think she's in good hands. Come, baby. Here we are. Your lunchbox is open. Get up there, honey. Go on. Have something to eat if you like. Please keep it closed. Stay put, I'll be right back. Omar, she didn't get in. I need you to stay with her. Then ask for the day off. What's the problem? Can't you do me a favor for once in your life? It's your kid, damn it! Lucy. Lucia. Lucy. Lucia. Hello. What's going on? Lidia. Hello. You look tired, Lore. Didn't you sleep well? When did your nightmares about your kids stop? I never dream. When, Magos? Never. If things are okay, and with a little luck, I dream... they're alright. But it gets worse every day, right? What if I could get out of here? Get out? The good way? Or the bad way. What are you up to, Lorena? Breaking out... You want them to kill you like they killed Sofia? You can help your kids from inside, but if you break out and get killed, what then? They'll be all alone. Really alone. You just want me to stay here. You think I don't know that? You got my stuff? - Three hundred. - Holy crap! Are you insane? - Take it or leave it. - Alright. Pay UP- YOU OWE me the razor. None of your candidates seem adequate. I can't recommend them to the mayor. I just don't get it. One of them has more than 10 years experience in high-security prisons. Another was trained by the Israeli army. And another has anti-terrorist training. I don't see what the problem is. My only problem is my experience with Moreno. Exo recommended her to replace Isabel Clave, because she was perfect, and look what happened. Well, nobody knew what would happen. Exo isn't responsible for Ana Moreno's marital issues. Marital issues? She killed her husband. And I got tired of telling you guys she was dangerous and unscrupulous. Sewing shift one is now open. Teresa, Mr. Fernandez is quite willing to reach some sort of agreement with you. He knows how delicate your situation is, so... I heard Exo's suggestions and I'm not convinced, so I will make my own proposal to the mayor. We'll find out who it is. We will, right? Monica Acosta. I'll send you her file in due time. Now I'd appreciate it if we could end this meeting, because I need to question Ana Moreno right now. How ironic. Monica Acosta? Fine. I'll take my proposals with me. I'll take them to the mayor myself. After all, it is his decision, and only his. Lucia! Lucia! Go on. Stop pouting, okay? Isn't this nice? Eat all of that. Mrs. Elba? Yes, what do you want? I have something you'll like. Okay. I'll be right over. You need beige, baby. - What is it, Magos? - La Negra. My God! La Negra! La Negra in prison? Looks like your friends deserted you. I'm doing all I can to have you transferred. I don't want you here. Whatever. Lots of people want me dead no matter where I go. - Do you mind? - Not at all, sir. You're accused of murdering Benjamin Nunez. Your husband. The medical report says it was a very cruel crime. He was stabbed several times all over his body while he was asleep. But you stated that you remember nothing, that it wasn't you. Several witnesses saw you arguing. You don't knife the person you most love. The man you share a bed with. The man you make love with. The man you live for. The man for whom you'd do anything. So who killed him? You claim you were framed. Framed by whom? And why, Negra? Why are you here? What do you mean? I'm keeping an eye on my company's workers. If what you say is true, I can imagine how you feel. I feel the same way about the guys that got my child convicted for a crime she didn't commit. Are they the same guys? Answer me. I don't know. Who paid you to frame her? What is this all about? You're not the D.A. I'm not accused of any of that. I don't belong here. Names, Negra, names! Who killed Brenda Yamilet? Who planted drugs, and a knife on my kid? You can't do this. Mrs. Lagos. Did your husband die because you wanted more money? Mrs. Lagos! Officer, take her to solitary confinement. That's the only place she'll be safe for now. What are you doing? What you should've done a long time ago. You got what you deserved, you mean bitch. Say hello to Bambi when you see her. - Have you seen this kid? - No. Sorry. Thanks. Have you seen this kid? No. When is my mom coming? She's too old. But she's so cute, and she's a good kid. Any couple would definitely want her. You know very well they prefer newborns, a year old at the most. She is too old to place her in a family. You're not taking her with you? First I need to see where to place her. - What do I do meanwhile? - I don't know. I don't want any trouble. Here, feed her well, and take care of her. Don't even think of spending it on your crap, and don't let her get sick, or the deal is off. I heard La Negra was robbing them blind. The money's what matters the least. She got our poor Sofia killed, so getting jail time is the least she deserves. That's right. We're not stupid. She's the one that helped her break out. Really? The gates of heaven haven't opened yet for Sofia. I don't know about that. All I know is she's dead and gone. Santita. - Come with me. - It's okay, I'll be here. The trimming, the trimming. Mercedes is getting impatient. I need to be sure they'll keep their promise. Everything's ready, as soon as you do your part, I'll get you out of here. We'll send you to Miami while things cool down, and send you the rest of the money. Why there? Pay me here. I'll find a place to go. Paying you over there is less risky. Unless you take longer than Monday, because the emerald dealer won't be interested any more. Tell her to watch it. I know a lot of things. Don't do anything stupid. Your case is still pending. Don't push your luck. What do I tell her? I'll do it on Monday. This book is for my client. Left line for conjugal visits. Left line for conjugal visits. - I'll take it to her. - Thanks. Do it by Monday, and don't do anything dumb. I won't. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. What does that mean? It means something to you. An eye for an eye. An eye for an eye. Things are going to change for you, Adelina. I know that. I'm leaving this place today. Did one of the guards, or a cellmate tell you this? A limb for a limb. Whoever kills a person... We'll try to make your departure as nice and easy as possible, Adelina. How can you help me? Your burden is greater than mine. What've you drawn? Put to death. Whoever kills a person must be put to death. An eye for an eye. An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. A limb for a limb. Whoever kills a person must be put to death. Whoever kills a person must be put to death. I'm sad over you, mommy. You got a minute, Lore? What is it? I'm pregnant. Please! Please don't be mad at me. I beg you. I swear it was just that one time. I fell for a guy, that's all. I messed with De la Lama, God rest his soul. I swear to God I don't care about anyone, not Blanca, not the shrink, I only care about you. You're wasting your breath, Colombiana. Don't be like that, come on. How can you say that when you and me... You and me? Come on. We just share a cell in this hellhole. I'm such an idiot. I thought about my cute little belly, you taking care of me and a bunch of other crap. I'm such an idiot. It serves you right. Are you really having it? Of course. My sister will take care of it. What about when they take it away? What about when he grows up without you around? What will you say when he comes to see you? That you did some bad things, and got locked up for the rest of your life? Filled with resentment and hate? Get rid of it while you still can, before you get too attached to him, or put your life and hope in someone you can't have, or the pain gets so bad you'd rather die on the inside to stop it. Because honey, no matter what you do, the pain of being separated from your child never goes away. What a bitch, right? How old is your girl? She's five. Mine is a boy. He's 7. They took him from me 6 months ago. We were on the swing in the park. He wanted ice-cream, and I pamper him so much I went to get some, and when I came back he was gone. Six months? I hear kids get stolen, and sold to rich people who can't have kids, but some poor kids have a hard time. Bad people kidnap them to rape and kill them. But have no fear, these guys do a great job. The other day they returned a kid to a lady. They called me so I think they found my kid. They'll find your girl, you'll see. Mrs. Sanchez. Yes? Have you found him? I'm sorry to inform you that your son is dead. I'm sorry. Aren't you glad? It doesn't seem so. I know, you're sad because I'm getting out. I'd take you with me if I could. You won't tell me if you had the Gringo killed. It was you, right? It was divine justice that's always done sooner or later. But why? I promised you I would. And I always keep my promises. So, have you thought about it? I understand there are other candidates. They're all Exo people, Monica. Women who will merely act in the firm's best interest. There have been a lot of irregularities, Monica. In fact we now think our daughter was framed, incriminated by the ex-head of security. There's a fiesta tomorrow. I could be with Nuro now in New York. At least I'd be back home, helping Ana Maria organize the fiesta. Back home this time of the year, we have parties with music, fireworks, and honey fritters. Nuro promised to get me out of here. But he didn't, and I'm stuck in here for good. No, Monse. Look, you only got five years. After that you'll go back home to your Nuro. You only got a year, and now you're facing 40. Silence. Silence. That's what'll happen to me. We'll get old in here. Nobody will remember us. You lying piece of shit! You killed a woman. What else have you done? I loved you. Who's there? You don't scare me, you fucking bitches. What's the matter, Negra? You've got a dirty conscience. Poor Benjamin was such a nice guy. The only idiot that paid any attention to you, and you killed him. "I didn't kill him, Mrs. Lagos. I didn't kill him." You made a fool of him, didn't you? You ugly bitch. I loved him. I didn't kill him. I'm innocent. Now what are you going to do? Make some calls? Send your goons to screw the other goons? You're really screwed, Negra. They're going to kill you. You don't exist. It's that simple. I don't want you to touch her. Why would I want to hurt that woman? Do I really have to remind you what Ana Moreno did for you? No, she didn't betray you. But I'm no fool. I don't buy her story. Politicians had Brenda killed as payback for attacking Santiago Marin? Come on! What do you care what happens to her? Do you really think I need to explain to you what I do, and why I do it, don Alvaro? You'll pay with your life if you lay a finger on her. Okay? What? Here's your supper. I said here's your supper. I want my mommy. Yeah? And I want you to eat. Cat got your tongue or what? I've had it with, I want my mommy! I want you to eat. Come here. You want me to go for you? Is that it? You want me to spank you to make you eat? Is that what you want? We'll find you a nicer mom, with a big house. No? Gringo parents with lots of dollars, to take you to Disneyland to see Mickey Mouse? Come here. Have you found her new parents? Maybe, first we need to run the usual tests. Come here. Stay still. Has she eaten? She won't eat anything. She's sad. Stay still, okay? Don't move. It hurts if you move. Blanquita, lend me your toilet. Mine's clogged up. Sure, baby. Thanks. Will you miss me when I'm gone? Obviously. You'll forget all about me. That's my number in case you see her, thanks. Sir, thank you. Miss, I'm looking for my little girl. That's my number. Thank you. That's my number in case you see her, thanks. Missing since 11/17/09. Cali this number if you see her. Shift number one, move it! Move it. Move it. Move it. Hurry UP! Sewing shift one now starting. Hurry UP! - Come here, baby. - I have to go to work. Go to the restroom at 10:30. I have something for you. What? A present that's pretty like you. Sure. Alright. A visitor, Negra. I'm talking to you, damn it. Move it. Who are you? Salvador Meneses, your new lawyer I don't have any money to pay you. Somebody did it for you. We're getting you out. We can prove you are innocent. So why am I still here? My client lost something and he thinks it's here. Find it and the next day you're out of this pigsty. So that's why they killed my husband. To get me back in here. I don't know what you mean. I'm just delivering a message. Motherfuckers. Tell your client I'm talking, that I'm saying what I know to screw him up. Bad idea, Ana. Your only chance to get out is by obeying his orders. Find my client's property, and it's all over. The mayor has Monica Acosta's file. I'm sure she'll be appointed on Monday. Yes? I'm on my way. I found a blank DVD, but look what it says. "The patient admits a man convinced her to kill Santiago Marin." Who? "The same man who abused her as a kid with her mom's help, by promising to make her a famous singer." - He wrote it the day he died. - Yes, look. - That's why he called Santiago. - They spoke that day? Teresa, it's Felipe. I need to clear up something. I need to tell you and Santiago something important about a patient. Don't leave Capadocia. I'm on my way. Stop! Stop! No! Felipe knew someone was behind the attack. He tried to tell Santiago and they killed him. Isn't that too much of a coincidence? Put a stakeout on Carlos Alzati. Be discreet. He can't leave the country. Alzati? He launched Brenda Yamilet to stardom as a kid. We investigated him, and came up with nothing. That crap about you being the baddest bitch in here is pure bullshit, you dumb bitch. - What's wrong with you? - I'm talking to this bitch. Leave her alone. Leave her alone. Cool it lady. - She's nuts. Are you okay? - I'm fine. They're starting to disrespect you. Watch it. Watch it. You're in no position to toy with us, Moreno. You're not talking? Okay, then I'll tell you what happened. Brenda Yamilet had the bad idea of confessing her crime to Dr. De La Lama, telling him all about the man that made her shoot Santiago Marin. You found out and warned the people you work for. They ordered you to kill her, and you did so immediately. Then you doctored a tape to frame Andrea Marin Lagos. Who did you give the missing pages from Yamilet's medical file to? Those pages are missing. You had Dr. Felipe De La Lama murdered. I don't know what you're talking about. You're sinking deeper and deeper. Who are you protecting? The guys that put you here? The guys that betrayed you, and won't lift a finger to help you? If you're accusing me of something, I want to see my lawyer. It's just an unofficial chat, Moreno. But it may get worse for you if you don't cooperate. You could at least be charged with conspiracy to murder Dr. Felipe De la Lama. Brenda Yamilet's murder. And conspiring to kill Santiago Marin. Someone had to be behind all this. Tell us who it is, and we might be able to cut a deal. You need protection, Moreno. The guys you worked for could have you murdered too. You know why we're talking here, and not in front of the D.A., right? Because you have no proof. I'm no fool, you know. You're casting your nets to see what you can catch, but you got the wrong girl. That's it? Should I torture her until she confesses? Of course not, but you can't let her go so easily. We don't have enough evidence, Teresa. You know her case won't hold up in court based just on circumstantial evidence. Yes? I'm on my way. Give her the bottle. Hello. - Write this down. - Hold on. 607 Campeche and Roma. Yes? - Mr. Carlos Alzati? - Just a moment. We're taking you in for questioning regarding Ms. Brenda Yamilet. Where's the warrant? Get my coat. Move it. Move it. I went through Monica Acosta's file, and I don't like it one bit. We need to pressure the mayor. One of our guys has to be head of security. What's wrong? They arrested Alzati. He's being interrogated. I have a terrible bellyache. Can I have 5 minutes to go to the restroom? - You know I can't. - I have to go. Five minutes. The Colombian. Come with me. I'll just be a minute. - Are you Ramona? - Yes sir. We were getting worried. Right honey? Yes. Is this the girl? Can I hold her? - Go on. - Come here baby. Don't cry. You're so cute. I'll make you a very happy little girl. Get in the car, honey. Ms. Elba says she paid you already? Yes sir, she did. So, are we done here? - Yes. - Thank you. You're welcome. Don't leave me! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! Shut up already you fucking kid! Follow that car. CHILDREN'S HOME AND HOSPITAL Where are you going? - I need to see somebody. - You can't go in there, sorry. If this is an interrogation, I'm not talking without my lawyer. No problem. We'll wait for your lawyer. Marla Santibanez, am I right? What's going on? The judge is increasing your sentence. Mine? My lawyer's getting me out very soon. She can't do a thing. Believe what you want, but you'll soon be getting another 40 years. For the Ojo de Agua case. 80 illegal aliens killed by the drugs they had in their stomachs. Ring a bell? What do you want? Cooperation. Names. Details. Useful information. We can get your sentence reduced in exchange for information leading us to the cartel. In other words, their heads for mine. I'll think about it. You know I need to protect you. Don't you dare isolate me you bastard. Return to your cells now. Return to your cells now. I can't keep her in there any longer. Do you feel guilty about your feelings? What do you think I'm feeling? Ana was involved in the death of someone close to you. Felipe was a good man. He didn't deserve to die like that. Come, Negrita. Where to? A regular cell. They can't do that to me. They can't transfer me. Those bitches will kill me. I just follow orders. Move it. - I'm not going anywhere. - Move it. - I'm not going anywhere. - Come on, you'll be fine. Ana has lots of scores to settle with those women. And I don't think there's much she can do about it. Lorena. Help me out here. I've always helped you. Really? Didn't you threaten to kill my kids? You know I'd never do that. I didn't mean it. You owe me 40. Lore. Hi gorgeous. It's our turn now. Take it easy, girls. Take it nice and easy. What's up precious? Don't you dare to come any closer to me. You have a lot of debts to pay, Negrita. Leave me alone! Stop it! Nobody lays a finger on her. Is that clear? Lieutenant Monica Acosta is our new head of security, as of today. - Welcome lieutenant. - Thank you. Exo welcomes you to Capadocia. We hope you do a good job. Let me introduce you to your jailer team. Gonzalez. Hortensia. At your service. - Lopez. Amira. - Neri. Leonor. Rivera. Socorro. - Lobera. Beatriz. - Mendoza. Monica. Okay, let's get to work. I suppose everything's ready? Yes, the surgeon is waiting for her in the operating room. What do you want us to hold on to? The kidney, of course. It ships out today. Let the doctor harvest whatever he needs. And you know what to do with the rest. It's so late already. Miss, what are doing here? What are you doing? Help! Help! Security! Security! Security! Stop her! He was so scared He was so scared he confessed after just 2 hours of interrogation. Just like that? We had him cornered. Dr. De la Lama's files are all the proof we need. Didn't he mention anyone else? It couldn't be the work of just one person, and Alzati's in advertising, why would he want me dead? There's someone above him, we're getting a name. It's not going to be easy, but I promise we'll make him talk. I wanted you to know that. I have to leave now. Excuse me. I think I owe you an apology for not believing in you or your investigation. Don't worry about it. People don't usually trust us cops. This is just the first step. When we discover who's behind the conspiracy to kill Santiago Marin, it will be easier to prove Andrea's innocence. I'M SEARCHING FOR MY DAUGHTER The State has produced sufficient convicting evidence against Elba Pérez Borja for the crimes of trafficking human organs, and kidnapping minors, therefore she is hereby sentenced to be incarcerated for a period of 45 years at Capadocia penitentiary. Gate! Put your personal belongings in the box. Don't be afraid. Welcome to Capadocia. Gate. The kids. - What? - The kids. Yes, I think you're right. Let's go to my room. Come.
