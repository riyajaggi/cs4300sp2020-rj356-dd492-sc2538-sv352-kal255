 THE SALT OF THE EARTH To me, acting is making an offering of my body and soul to give life to a dream. I am... I am a filter, through which flows the most absurd ideals. The most extreme passions. Love, terror. Crime. I embody the desires of others. That's why they admire me. And fear me.

 Gonzaga, we're ready to ship 2 tons out to you. Good, how about customs, and the permits? Federico. It's all under control. We've got the customs permit for the lingerie, and the treasury's classification as a low-risk exporter, and all sanitary permits, so nothing raises suspicion. How many shipments? Just one. Any problem? Barajas airport is covered. I'd have to confirm the date and time. You'll be notified 2 hours in advance. That's very little time. I'm not risking it. Any other problem?

 We hear a lot about Mexico. The boss is worried about all the busts there's been. There's been a lot of stings lately, but none of our guys are in jail. We bribed a lot of top guys. Okay, but for how long? As long as it takes. We don't want anything getting lost on the way. I'm telling you, Gonzaga, there's no problem. I'm doing my part, you do yours. I'm shipping you the stash, you just make sure everything goes well over there, okay? I'll be expecting your confirmation. Okay. What's wrong? Whenever we lose a stash, Federico, Gonzaga's feelings of insecurity is the result. My credibility with don Angel depends on this deal. I want everything, everything to go well. I want all our shipments to be made from Capadocia again. I'm not losing any more money. Is that clear? I asked my colleagues for a sample of the finished product from Exo's new prison. They're producing lingerie now, and stuffing them. Not only Cristobal was trafficking, Alvaro Fernandez del Real is exporting drugs to Spain, directly from the prisons. That can't be. He's being supplied from Capadocia? Of course not, I check all the shipments myself, and Monica searches them too. I'll have to tighten security. I don't know if I should tell Victor Hernandez. I think we can trust him after what he did for Andrea. We're too implicated, Teresa. Santiago, Andrea is free. And we have proof. Let us report all of this, even if I'm tried for hiding drugs in Capadocia, even if you're charged, Santiago. No, Teresa. Things aren't that simple in politics. Don't be so naive. You want justice to be served? That's okay. Do you want us to risk our lives for this? I want to have a clear conscience. There you go. I think it's dry. I'm taking it off. Tell me if it sticks. Ready? Here we go. So? Is this me? Whatever you want to be. That's the joke about masks. They're said to unmask whatever's inside of you. You'd love what I've got in me, gorgeous. Masks fall off pretty fast in here. We're all who we are. - Let's paint this. - Right. Magos, the warden wants to see you. Go for it. Hey Luis. I've got a proposal for you. How about a conjugal visit? Will you think about it? There's nothing to think about. It's possible. I know you have some stuff you keep for yourself. You're nobody, Lorena. You've had it. You're dead, bitch! Don't ever touch me again. - Let go! Let go! - Move it. Let's clear the set. Let's clear the set. Why are you surprised? I always get good reviews. And this heading is what I liked best. "Actors are madman who become sane when they give life to a character." This is wonderful, but you should've said actresses. You think so? Of course. You look just divine. Look at this. Stop talking and let me see that. "The actress of the moment." Disgusting. I hate them. I hate them. Why don't they protect me? Why don't they? I'm just the star of Eternal Love, that's all. I'm this network's ratings. I am the ratings. Good morning. I'm your new makeup artist. Azucena. Sorry, I didn't know she was here. Azucena? This, honey, is my dressing room. Nobody comes in here before I do. One more thing, Azucena. You will address me as ma'am. We are not equals. Get out. I'll call you if I need you. Get out! Are you deaf or just stupid? - My baby. - Get this crap out of here. Baby, come to mommy, alright? Here's your cell phone. And today's breaks. Some flowers. A message. Something to show he cares. Why can't he do that? Is it that hard? You look beautiful. Good morning. Are you ready for your mike, miss? Unbelievable. A deaf one and now... Now this blind one. Are you blind? Are you blind? Come closer, take a good look. I'm not dressed. This isn't my costume. Get out. I can't stand you! Out! Get her out of here! I can't stand the heat. I need some water. PRE-RELEASE ORDER I don't get it. Due to your illness, Magos, you're being freed before serving your sentence. Really? - When? - As soon as tomorrow. Are they kicking me out so I won't die here? I want you to get treated. You need to be free for your chemotherapy. I've made arrangements. You can start right away. Magos, this is your chance to beat this. To make up with your daughter. My sweet little girl. These are the papers the clinic will ask you for. I'm free? I don't even know what that is. Gate. What is it? Are my boys alright? Patrick picked them up at school a few days ago. Why didn't you tell me earlier? We didn't tell you earlier because your mom and I thought we could find him, talk him out of it. Dad! We reported him to the police. They told us to wait a few days. What did the cops say now? Patrick left the house and his job. They say he could've fled the country. Did they talk to Susana, his girlfriend? We did, she knows nothing. Baby, baby, for God's sake, I did what I thought was best. There was nothing you could do in here. You don't know what I could've done, dad. Baby. Gate. Gate. Enough. Enough! I can't take this anymore! Enough! Where's Tatiana? There she is, in the back. Good morning. Production. Grace, you look lovely. What can I do for you? Tatiana. You have a list of people who can approach me? Yes. This morning a makeup artist was in my dressing room. This is the last time I'm giving you a list of those who can approach me, or talk to me. And nobody's to be at my rehearsals, nobody. Get rid of anyone that's not necessary. Fire them. I don't care. Do it. Come, come, come. - Security, please! - Tell me when you're ready. Come in. I'm not going to bite you. Don't be afraid. Have you got my stuff? I did it as a favor. I expect to be repaid. You guys owe me big time for my husband's death, Federico. Didn't you talk to your lawyer? Did he tell you... who's defending you and why? We'll know soon enough if that stash is here. This will help. These bitches will go crazy when they can't get a fix anymore. Then what? Then Teresa Lagos won't know what to do. Anything could happen. I feel safe. I'm not scared. You live in fear. It's all over your face. You've got so much to lose. I don't anymore. I've got one thing left. My dignity. And my freedom, of course. Return to your cells now. Return to your cells now. Back to your cells. Back to your cells. What can you do to make Patrick come back from wherever he is, Lore? I don't see how from in here. Hey. Now that I'm leaving... maybe I could help you from out there. What is it Magos? Hold on. Eva Maria! Are you okay? Thanks. It's just that... I have a seizure when... When I think about leaving this place. Why? Aren't you happy? You can't... wait to get out of here, but me... I want to stay inside. This is my home. You guys are my family. Magos, no, never. A jail is not a home. When that gate opens... Where do I go? To the left? To the right? I'm kidnapped! Yes, kidnapped in this set! Sixteen hours a day, for months! I don't have a life! I don't... Stop it! I don't have to tell you. You know exactly what I mean. I don't know. These people are so slow. Let go! Don't touch my dog! Get out, you're fired! Get out! He was chewing your costumes. Here, screw the costumes. Get out! Get out! And don't come back! I'm sorry. They touched Tito. On the phone, Hector? You're breaking up with me on the phone? Go to auntie, baby. Are you okay, baby? Can we rehearse now? No rehearsal. Let's just do it. Sorry to butt in, but I need to rehearse. No rehearsal! I'm quitting this soap if we don't start right now. We do things my way. Start shooting! Look at me. Look at me. I'm ready. Adlib it, son. Valentin. - Don't worry... - Start shooting! Damn it! - Take her cue, to hell with it! - Lights! - Prompter! Please! - Lights. Auntie? Fucking bitch. Please leave if you're not in this scene. Lights off in ten. Return to your cells now. Return to your cells now. Putting on your nightgowns? Go to bed. Go easy with that. I'm your supplier from now on. God help you if you buy any from Lorena. Of course not, Negrita. And you work for me now. La Mara and La Negra. La Negra's my girl. "We are all stars of our own destiny. "I don't want fame. "I just want to be an actress. Ferreira." Okay, Maguitos. So you won't forget me, dear. Here's some money from all of us to help you out. Take care of yourself. Take care, and come to see us on Sundays, you promise? Sundays? Sundays are lonesome days. Yes, I'll come to see you. God bless. Thank you. You too. Look after Lore. Whenever you say, Magos. BYE, baby. Behave. I'll go as far as I can. I'll see you outside when I get out. I'll never forget you. Hurry up and get out. I need you. God bless you my girls. Magos. Come, Magos. Silence. Silence. That's it Lorena. It's time. Come. I'll try to convince La Negra to let you help her. I need to know if she killed her husband. I don't know what you're thinking, but if she tells me, it's a professional secret. I get that, Valeria. But I need your support. For what? I'm almost sure she's in here for a reason. That she didn't kill him, and she's back in here for some other reason. All I ask of you is to be alert, that's all. I'm always alert. Good. Magos. If you need anything, please, call me. And remember, you're not alone. You're not alone, Magos. Let's go, Magos. Gate. Gate. - You think they'll take me? - Of course. - I'm so nervous. - Don't worry. Let's see how it goes. - What school? - Medicine. Classes begin on June 7. You need 125 of 150 points to be accepted, pay the fee at the bank and... Is this all? Yes. Your background check is missing. I thought it wasn't a requirement at this college. Most colleges including this one, miss, reserves the right to admission. We need that document. Well, you see, I have a criminal record. But I want to make things right, I want to study. I'm sorry, you can't take the test. You don't understand. I can afford the tuition, I'll sign a letter of good conduct if necessary. You can't study here. Go elsewhere. That's not fair. I need you to leave. There're people waiting. I want to study, not kill people. Come, Ruth. Off to your therapy, sir? Yes, my wife and kids will be here soon. No problem. Lorena. Sewing shift 2 now opening. Lorena. Officer, give us a moment. It hit you hard that Magos left, right? It's always like that when someone leaves. Patrick took my kids out of the country. Everything's bad. What do you want sir? I want to help you. Get me out of here. You see? There's nothing you can do. - Is this the Santa Ana bus? - Hop in ma'am. - Here? - Right here. - How much is it? - Three pesos. DON'T MAKE ME DO THINGS THE HARD WAY Yes? How do you like the package? Don't worry. This time it's just to warn you we're close. Your son is okay, but you need to help us or the next finger will be his. You'll get your orders soon. Very good. Thank you. She'll do it, don't worry. As soon as she does, we'll start stuffing lingerie in Capadocia again. What about the warden? She will have to make up her mind. Stand up, damn it. Well, well, Sofia. It's payback time, and you're screwed. Well done, Negrita. Your first customer. Come in. Why don't you check your e-mail? Your ex-wife is cute. It's Lourdes, right? What's your son's name? It's a good thing they moved on in life, and it'd be a shame for you to put them at risk again. That's not necessary. No, I'm no gangster. I'm just a businessman in search of collaborators, who are clean and unbribable like yourself. Take the money or take a bullet, right? Don't let appearances deceive you, Mr. Fernandez. Cheers. To your future. Grace is so abusive because nobody stands up to her. Grace is so abusive because nobody stands up to her. Are you going to let her fire me like that? Tatiana, I was there, all Bertha did was stop the dog from ruining her costumes. Right, Azucena? Yes. Bertha, there's no way I'm letting you go. Just stay away from her, please. You know what she's like. I'm sick and tired of this. That's not fair. There are so many of us. I don't know, but now that she's marrying Hector, things will only get worse. - Hector Montalvo? - What? Didn't they break up? They made up, and now there's a huge wedding. What? Dear God! And that's not the worst of it. They're the producers of the next three projects. - What? - You'll lose your job, Tatiana. If she's like this now, imagine her with all that power. She's not getting any more power. We won't let her. Either the nice way or the hard way, because I'm not backing off. Okay, okay, okay. What can I get you? Here you go. So what can I get you? Have a seat ma'am. Thank you son. Hi Victor. - Come in. - Thanks. It's about something very serious. Not even Santiago knows I'm here. But I trust you. I'll try not to disappoint you. Drugs. The fillings can produce up to 400 doses. They're packed in our prisons, and shipped directly to Spain. The question is who allows this to go on. They would need a lot of people. Adequate infrastructure, raw materials. Who lets tons of pure ephedrine enter the country? Who signs the permits at City Hail, the Treasury, Health, Customs. Who does Fernandez del Real take orders from? The Attorney General knows this? No, I wanted to tell you first. Is this all the proof you have? Victor, I'm willing to get to the bottom of this. I expect you to do your job. - Joaquin. - Hey. - Are you coming? - No, I can't. - Is lunch ready? - Yes. Wash your hands at least. Pass me the plates, Irene. Let's have this soup, and God will come and get us. If I could go back, you're the one I'd kill. Yeah right. You're too scared of me. Aren't you? That's why you couldn't kill yourself. Help yourself. - I'm eating by myself? - I won't be long. Baby. What are you doing here? I'm out. I'm a free woman. Irene. Just a minute, daddy. You still call him... daddy? Stay out of it. Don't judge me. You of all people. You can't stay here. Go away. Go away or I'll call the cops. You broke out, didn't you? You didn't do 40 years. They let me out because I've got cancer. Good. Rot in hell for what you did. I still remember everything perfectly well. No, baby. You don't remember everything. The man you have for a husband, gave me three kids. He raped them. He didn't care that they were just kids. He got you pregnant. That's why I did... what I did. But what for? You're a woman now and he still has you. Irene. Who are talking to? Nobody. Come and eat your stew. Right line for conjugal visits. Right line for conjugal visits. Let's go. Any news about your kids? No, my parents are doing what they can, but I don't know where Patrick has them. Any news about my case? It's moving along but slowly. Don't get desperate. But I called you for something else. I reported the drugs. There will be an investigation. You need to take a back seat to avoid hurting your case. My case could take years. I don't have time. My kids are in danger. That's exactly why I need you to take a back seat. I'll probably be charged for it, but my defense is better than yours. So it has to be our secret, alright? Here, take Tito with you. So I come in here and hear what they say? Exactly. Your lines? I know mine. Grace, do you want to practice your lines? Of course not. - Gabo. - I'm ready when you are. - Cameras? - Ready to roll. - Shoot when I get to the cabin. - Yes sir. Let's go. Your cue is when I say, I want to be with you. Getting ready to shoot. Quiet everybody. Federico, it's me, Lorena. We need to talk urgently. Great. - The gun's been checked. - Okay. Here, here, and here? To the chest and the stomach. It's totally safe. Okay. Great. Ready up there? - Ready. - Start rolling please. - Does she have the gun? - Yes. - Fuse caps hot. - Fuse caps hot sir. Control room ready? Roll sound. Roll cameras. Five. Four. Three. Two. Sebastian, my love, would you do anything? Of course I am. - That's it. - Perfect. - My love, I'm sorry I doubted you. - No, don't go. Don't say a word. Damn you! You're hitting on him like a slut. And you? Coward. Judas. - That's it. Shoot her. - That's it. - Calm down. - Take it easy. What have you done? What've you done, Romelia? Honey, Luisa Fernanda. Please wake up. That's it! Cut. That's a print. Great. Great acting, guys. Just great. Grace. Grace. She's been shot! She's hurt! Get help! What? What? Run. Get help now! - She was shot. - That's impossible. No, no, I didn't do it. It wasn't me! It wasn't me! What are you doing here? Taking a walk. This is so pretty. Really? Go walk somewhere else. Move it. Move it! You know you can't be here. This way. I'm so glad we understand each other so well, Monica. So very well. I won't be here for long. I'm applying for a transfer. The problem is once you're in, there's no way out, unless it's in a coffin. What do you want? See? That's so much better. Politely. I'd like to talk with you, but not here. That cop doesn't like me to be in here. Anyway. Meanwhile, what I need at this very moment, is Lorena for a little while. Want some advice? Don't question anything. Don't make a fuss. That's a bad place to go. My bed, my sister. We're a family. I don't think you should worry about not being admitted by that school. You can study abroad. No mom. I don't want to leave you, dad, or this fool. You had to go to jail to like me? Yes, I learnt a lot of things inside, one of which is I love you very much. Alright. - Don't stay up late. - No. Sweet dreams. - No kicking. - Don't be so delicate. Go to your room if you don't like it. Switch the light off. Are you okay? Yes. Would you like to have dinner? Wine? Just a glass. When they laugh like that, I feel like stopping time. Don't worry, I'll tell him. Be nice to him, okay? - You like him or what? - Please. There she is. She wants to talk to you. She's very nervous. She knows something. Hi. I've always said that you are a very unnerving woman, too much I'd say. I have your stash. Where? Not that fast. We need to cut a deal. What do you want from me? Get me out of Capadocia and you'll have your stuff. How do I know you have my stuff? Fétima Carbajal, Azucena Montiel, Bertha Carranco and Tatiana Garcia, charged with first degree murder. Welcome to Capadocia. Take the red line and stay apart. Move it girl! I'm in a hurry. Gate. Gate. Your stuff. Walk on the line. Move it.
