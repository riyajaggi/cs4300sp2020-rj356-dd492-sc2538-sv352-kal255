 THE THIRD PART OF THE SEA BECAME BLOOD Get down! Now! Now! Shut up! Down. Get down, get down! Don't move. Freeze, freeze, freeze! Come here. Come here. Get on your knees. Now. Now. And stay there. They're letting them go? We're just as surprised as you are, Mr. Ramirez, but the judge says the evidence is inadmissible. How can it be inadmissible?

 They were caught shooting Edna, in the act! Please calm down sir. We're trying to stop the release order, but we can't trace the cash you paid for your wife. Plus the detainees' testimony is all we have, we need more solid proof. Don't count on me. I did exactly as you said, and all for what? They cut off my wife's finger and she's a pianist. I'm going to the media with all the proof I can get. That won't help you, the judge hasn't ruled yet, and another case is in the headlines. Fourth, that the defendant, Teresa Lagos Mancera, is formally charged as presumably guilty as charged

 of the crimes of abuse of authority, conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit a crime. Gate. Mrs. Lagos, please. Stay away from me. Thanks for loving me so much, Colombian, you Judas. Just a minute. You're the Judas that made me sew that stuff 2 nights in a row to get us out of here. I couldn't take you. I had to get my kids. Now I'm back because of you. I'm sorry Lorena. I didn't do it on purpose, I swear. The USB. What? The USB. Did you give it to her? I'm going to kill you Colombian! Let her have it, Colombian! Shut up! All of you! Look who's here. Let me know if you need anything ma'am. Thanks Monica. What about me Monica? Shut up Negra. You shut up. That dumb bitch is nobody in here now. Welcome to hell. You're screwed. Because we're all equal in here. Right? Are we all equal or not? Stay away from her, Negra. Look, Colombian. Look who stole your girlfriend. I'll give this bitch a warm welcome. Where is it? What? My USB. Where is it? Where's my USB? What the hell are you talking about? If you're going to kill me do it you bastard, but if we're going to do business... I'll put a bullet in your head if you don't tell me where the hell my USB is. What's so funny? Answer me. You know what I'm worth, Emiliano. Is what you've got in that damn thing worth killing an infiltrator of my rank in the Mexican government, on some stupid suspicion? Think about it. If I had that damn thing, you'd be the one on your knees. Son of a bitch! Don't you dare! Come here. Over here. She has it. Sure. What? Lorena Guerra. The Capadocia inmate I told you to kill. We were together. We argued. She has it, and you're getting it back. Get Federico to do it. It's a special favor. Get my USB back, my stash that's in Capadocia, and kill Lorena. After Teresa's scandal Capadocia's the center of attention. I don't care. Santiago Marin was also the center of attention and look at what happened. Nobody investigates anything in this country. - Good afternoon. - Where's don Joaquin? - Haven't you seen him? - He didn't go to Toluca with you? No, that's weird. Dad. "It would be better for him "if a millstone were hung around his neck "and he were thrown into the sea, than that he would cause one of these little ones to stumble." Luke 17-2. Hang a millstone around his neck and thrown into the sea? What the hell is this? That is Luke 17 - 2. The Jerusalem Bible. He was a priest involved in a pedophile scandal. So? It's interesting that some of his victims were Valeria's patients, that she herself helped send him to jail. But a judge let him off. Then he was found dead all of a sudden. Valeria's bad luck is following her around. How interesting. What about her private life? What about her mating habits? Boys or girls? Right now there's nothing. Seriously, she seems to be as asexual as the angels. Return to your cells. Return to your cells. Capadocia's warden? But Mr. Attorney General, I... The previous warden tried to help an inmate escape for reasons I know of, but I need someone I can trust. Somebody Teresa can trust. Yes but I don't know if I'm the right person. Victor Hernandez ordered me to isolate you for your own good. - We need to talk. - Hold on. What is it? Looks okay. They didn't put us together to protect us. I stole Emiliano's USB after I saw Victor Hernandez at his house. I gave it to the Colombian. But we're dead if he has it now. Why didn't you tell me? I planned to use it as leverage. I never thought you'd be back or the Colombian would betray me. Victor could've killed us when he caught us. He had the perfect excuse, so why didn't he? Maybe he doesn't have it yet. If Victor finds out what we know about him, we're dead. You've got a friend here if you need to talk. Thanks but I have nothing to say. Colombian, get this. It's not that Lorena doesn't love you, it's just that Teresa Lagos is so convincing. Why do you think they're not here? They should be having a great time in bed. She hit me. You tried to rip an eye out. Liar, this bitch provoked me. She hit he here. "The warden sold drugs and escape plans." Who would ever think Mrs. Lagos could be our best ally? You son of a bitch. That campaign you orchestrated was just perfect. Well she had it coming the damn fool. So. How do you like the new warden? I like her. I don't know what you think. She hasn't the faintest idea how to run a prison, or have the political background necessary for the job, but that could be an advantage, right? Where would the company be without a man of your insight and initiative, my brother, damn! I ask myself the same thing. See you. I need to pay for those headlines. They're not for free. Question. - What's more likely? - About what? That a prisoner that's fed up of the way she was treated, kills Mrs. Lagos. Or that she herself, riddled by guilt and remorse, decides to kill herself? I answered all their questions and signed my statement. This is off the record. You tried to kill yourself when you were arrested. And now you're walking. You got a great lawyer, Romina. Very expensive. A girl's luck. If you preferred to die than get arrested... your bosses must be very powerful. Question. What will they do to you out there? Help me here, Romina. Avoid being dumped in an alley after a week of torture. Or getting beheaded. You know better than me what to expect in these cases. You guys killed my boss in the raid. He was their contact. Romina, tell me the truth, not this pack of lies. It's all in there. They took the lady out of the clinic. Out of the operating room, while she was sedated. Then they took her to a safe house in a van. They just paid me to look after her. I didn't shoot her. I understand you had to escape to find your kids. But why is Teresa involved? What was your plan? I know all about your night trips outside. I know you went to see a big cartel boss. I've never left Capadocia. It's no use denying it. My informants saw you at Emiliano Trevino's place. I really want to help, Lorena. Victor, I need proof of your loyalty. Get rid of any witnesses, including Lorena. As you wish. Don't touch me you bastard. You're making me do something I didn't want to. You piece of shit. - There's nothing here, sir. - Keep looking. You fucking piece of shit. She's clean. I told you so pig. Give us a moment. What now? A death blow like with Federico? I know everything. You work for Emiliano. If anything happens to me or Teresa... Believe it or not, it's all for you. You and your kids could die if you don't give it to me. I don't know where Emiliano lost whatever it is he lost. How and when did they kidnap Mrs. Villalobos? From her room right before her face lift. A commando broke in an hour earlier firing everywhere. From her room an hour before? Yes sir, and they almost killed me too, since I was just about to get the patient ready. Fortunately for me the phone rang. When were these repaired? This week. They have pictures of what this looked like. I've lost a lot of clients since Edna was kidnapped. We might need you to cooperate with us, doctor. Sorry, I might go back to Spain. The security here really sucks. Edna wasn't just a patient, she was my friend look how she died, and the cops keep interrogating us. That's it. Why don't you get to work? You have Julieta's statement. Leave us alone. Excuse us detective. Do you understand the trouble you're in? You can expect 30 years in prison for this, unless you can give me something credible. I know nothing and I have nothing to say. What else do you know about the guys that pack drugs in the men's prison? I know nothing about any drugs. And if you insist, I need my lawyer. Cut this crap out Teresa! The guys you're protecting could've tried to kill your husband. I'm willing to face the consequences. Why were you a call girl if you're so rich? I was stupid. I didn't want to marry a prince I didn't know. To get back at dad, really. You damn thief, Negra. Where's the drug? What's going on? This is why we need more drugs. These women are losing it. Gentlemen, we're looking for hard drives, DVDs, CDs, storage devices, especially a gold USB, move it. Why are you hiding that in there? Give it to the cops and put her away as she deserves. I didn't betray Lorena. I didn't want to lose her. Yeah right. Love is a bitch, right Colombian? Of all the dumb things I did, the one I regret most is loving you so much. I never loved you Bambi. I feared you. But not anymore. Not anymore. Shut up. Shut up! You love me. The one you should fear is that insipid little thing. And falling for a traitor. That's what. What's wrong? The usual problems. The staff isn't happy. They want more money. Again? Those people don't get it. In a way they're right. No way honey. You're the boss. You pay them. And they work. That's how it works. Forget about it. It's not worth it. We're going back to Spain anyway. I already told you I don't want to. You want to stay here? It's not safe. How many threats did you get this week? I know but I don't want some bitch ordering me around. So you prefer to take orders from your friends, your brothers? What did they tell you? Stay here and get killed. Look what happened to Edna. Nobody orders me around. Much less I who love you more than anything. They'll kill us out there, Aldo. Let us go back to Madrid. We'll run your business from there. Have reports sent to you. Say something. What do you think? Don't push me Julieta, I warn you. I called the cops. They'll investigate the threats. The terror of not knowing if they'll kill you, or cut off a limb even. The point is they're walking out of jail. They'll reorganize. After a few days they'll go after someone else. What do you want? Please leave. Edna's not saying anything. The judge can't close the case with her statement. She's safe. Nobody knows she's alive. You said that was to avoid retaliation, not for her to talk. I won't let her get involved. Ivan. This won't happen again if it's up to me. What's going on Amira? - Yes? - The screens went blank. SYSTEM FAILURE We have only 2 minutes, that's it. Security. Security. Backup. 80 seconds. Security. Security. SYSTEM FAILURE Security. Security. Security. Why would that idiot Cristobal rob this from Carlos? Where's the USB? - Lorena doesn't have it. - She does. A nurse checked her, scanned her from head to foot. I searched every inch of her cell, she doesn't have it. It can't just vanish into thin air. Why don't you ask your men? That's precisely what I'm doing. And guess what. Nobody knows anything so far. I need that USB. I have a feeling Lorena has it. I'd rather you stopped scanning her and rip her open. And kill Teresa too. Those two know too much. You can leave now. I got you this. Thanks. Come here. Sit here with me. Go on. You like me, right? You know what I'd do for you, in exchange for a little favor? A very little one. I'd do a lot of stuff to you. You'll love it. What the hell were you thinking? You made a huge mistake by exposing Victor. I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking. It was so humiliating. How did they get it out? Who had access to that exit? Federico and the head of security. Monica? - Sofia. Sofia. - Let go, I need my medication. What medication? Should I call the doctor? No, I can't go to the infirmary. I need a fix right now! - I don't have any drugs. - Please, anything, anything. Calm down Sofia. Here take this. Negra! This is all I could get. Don't be silly Federico. This can't control all these crazy bitches. You want another riot? That's it. Take it or leave it. I have a job for you. Do it and you'll have whatever you want. Send it over tomorrow please. Sure. Thanks. I know you're not interested, but your papers are ready. Stop ignoring me, Aldo. Say something, damn it! Now what? Julieta Puig, you're under arrest for kidnapping Edna Villalobos. - You're nuts. - Shit. Let go of me. Aldo! Aldo! HEY, hey, drop it. Drop it. Are you sure about this? I've seen it done a lot. I know how. That's how they reduce coke in Tepito. This isn't coke. These bitches don't care. There won't be enough unless it's mixed. That's rat poison. You'll kill them. Who rules here? Answer me! You do, you do. Cook it and don't stop stirring it. To think Andrea was in here too. Just like me. I think I'll never see her again. Giving up already? I feel like dying sometimes, but I can't. I can't leave my kids all by themselves. Butter. Daddy. - What? - Can I fly? You're a kid, not a bird. Why? You feel like flying? I do. They rent paragliders near here. I promise to go flying with you very soon. Okay? Go to sleep. No, Patrick. I don't want to. I don't, I don't. She sedated me for the operation. I was in the safe house when I woke up. Who cut your finger off? She did. Julieta Puig. They kept me sedated thinking I couldn't see anything. But then she... She made sure it wasn't infected. I'm sure it's her because of the accent. She's been paid. Is he one of them? They say he's the boss. He distributed the money. She picked the victims. They argued in front of me, when the other kidnappers demanded more money. What are you doing here? Right line for conjugal visits. Left line for social visits. How are the girls? They are in Canada. They're okay. You shouldn't have come. My only hope was that you were all safe and far away. What about me? How can I possibly be okay with you in here? I'll go to the DA, the president. You can't talk to Javier Cordoba, or anybody else. What am I supposed to do? Watch you sacrifice yourself for Lorena Guerra? She was about to get in trouble because of my mistake. I don't give a damn! We are the only people you should think of. Me and your kids. You deserted us, Teresa. You deserted us. What do I do now? What can I do for you? Do you want your medication? Yes or no? I signed all that crap you told me to, regarding Federico's parties, everything, but don't be silly, Negra. Why don't you ask Yolanda to do that? Who accused me of killing Brenda Yamilet? It was you, idiot. You're doing it. Go to the shooting gallery tonight, do the job and you can have your stuff. How can I kill... - Sofia. What did you do to her? - I did nothing. Security. Security. - Stay here. - Okay. Security. Security. I'll call you back. I didn't let you in because I'm busy. Don't you know what's going on? We can nab Emiliano tomorrow as he loads his stash on a ship. It's not the right time. I can prove he's a killer, bribes the police department, ships drugs out of Exo's prisons, runs a prostitution ring there with Federico. What do you mean it's not the right time? Just like you heard. It's not the right time. When will it be the right time? When he kills me? When we get Teresa and Lorena's corpses? Since when do I report to you? I said nobody touches Emiliano and that's the way it is. It's a national security issue, period. Shove your national security. I quit. You quit? Nobody quits just like that and you know it, Victor. You got yourself in this and you're in to the very end. You'll continue to work undercover until further notice. Is that clear? Get out of here, I'm very busy, and find Emiliano's USB. It's all true, but don't I have an option? No, doctor, you could get 60 years with that kind of evidence. Sign here please. Extradition? Why? She confessed to several fraud charges in Spain and elsewhere. She confessed everything, names, dates, even her aliases. What's the sentence going to be? Ten years max. No way. That can't be. The extradition process isn't complete. I'll make sure she doesn't leave the country. Lorena gave you information about Emiliano Trevino's cartel. Both your lives depend on you giving me that information. I know nothing. But if I did, why should I trust you? Because I want to protect you. But especially Lorena. Gate. Five minutes. Gate. I came to give you this. Return to your cells. Keys to the gate Emiliano uses to take us to his parties. I didn't rat on you. You're the person I've always loved the most. And I screamed out of fear, that's all. Because I thought I'd die without you. I didn't want to hurt you. You'd understand if you ever loved someone. Tell me you loved me even if it's a lie. Gate. Gate. Handcuffs. Why didn't she go elsewhere? This is the only prison her gang hasn't infiltrated. Every jail in this country is. We can't take another prisoner. It's just until they decide to try her in Mexico or abroad. This isn't a hotel. Great, the real vida loca. Take them to their cells. What about me Negrita? I'm next right? No way. What about that job? Stop toying with me. I can't do it without a fix. Only after you do your job. They can't be seen here. Get them out of here, move it! - Move it. - Damn it. - Move it, bitches. - Get out of here. Lorena, I'm coming to get you. Get out the same way you got in. You already paid. All of you, it's the same way out. Move it, bitch. God damn it. - Move it bitches. - Move it. Move it. You need to sue them. It's unthinkable in a democracy. Who do I sue, Veronica? The guys that did this? And the guys that tried to kill me? Put me on your newscast. Please let me talk on your newscast. It's my only chance to save Teresa's life. Not bad. Look what Victor sent you. He found it in Capadocia. After this shipment we can discuss some real deals. Send those to the container. Hold it. I need to check this out first. After I verify the amount and the quality, then we can talk all you want. What the fuck? This stuff is lime jello. Get that bastard Victor. Don't tell anybody. Understood? You can do it. Yes sir. What good will that do? As long as Monica and Victor are protecting us, we're stuck in this cell. We could get sick. I don't know. Get out! Get out! Let's Move it Teresa! Monica. I got you a sandwich. Thanks. My son liked these. You have a son right? Who told you that? Federico? What does Federico have to do with anything? Open all gates. - They left us some clothes. - It's a trap. I'd rather die outside than in here. - Get out of here. - Let go of me, damn it! I said get out! Shit. The cops. Where are you going? Get down now. Who's there? I have a gun! It's me. Where's mom? I cried so much my godmother brought me. God! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. They're here for the bodies. There are 15 of them. I have the hospital's report on the 5 survivors. They think it's rat poison. You're still here? It'll only get worse. You Capadocia rat. I'm sick of this place and everybody in it. If you're so sick of me, go look for Magos' husband, or that priest you tortured for hours instead of me? Shut up. You're dead. Tell your little brother that. You know he can't rest in peace. Why did you come here? You could've gone to a nuthouse instead. But you came here. You know why? Because you don't want to be cured. You want to be punished. Shut up. You're dead. Not even the dead get out of Capadocia. Let's go!
