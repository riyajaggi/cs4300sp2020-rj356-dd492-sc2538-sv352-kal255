 Outsourced (2010â€“2011): Season 1, Episode 9 - Temporary Monsanity - full transcript

Fearing defeat, Todd works his employees extra hard, only to find his efforts thwarted when the power goes out due to a torrential downpour. Meanwhile, Charlie tries to redeem himself after losing to Manmeet and Gupta at the Indian version of billiards by challenging them to a game of laser tag.

 All right, guys. Let's really push this Thanksgiving stuff. All right? In a week, it will all be on clearance. Can I suggest our signature turkey-butt gravy boat? Yeah. It pours out the backside. Look. I'm a Pilgrims and an Indian. Burn the witch! Sir? I am confused.

 Why is he fully clothed for winter, but she is dressed for prostitution? Because the Pilgrims hadn't taught them to be ashamed of their bodies, yet. They are an odd couple, these Pilgrims and Indians. Yeah. They kind of had a complicated relationship. It's quite simple, really. The Pilgrims came to a land which was not their own and subjugated the Indians so the white man could run the call center. I mean, the country. All you've got to remember is that the Indians helped the Pilgrims survive the winter. So, that's why we have these huge feasts and we give thanks. So, if the Indians gave the Pilgrims shelter, what did the Pilgrims give the Indians?

 Less land to worry about? Actually, they prefer to be called Native Americans. Why? Well, they find the term "Indian" derogatory. All right, people. Tomorrow is Black Friday. You know what that is? Martin Luther King Day? No. Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving. It's America's busiest shopping day of the year. And I don't think you guys realize how intense it's going to be. I want you to watch this. Now, this is a couple of years ago. It's 5:00 a.m. People have been standing in this line for hours waiting for this sale. You see how out of control it can get? Out of control? I go through worse getting on my train in the morning. But if you think that's horrible, I might be late tomorrow. No, people were seriously hurt. It started a riot. As riots go this is rather tame. I see no tear gas, no batons, no one set on fire. I could riot circles around those people. All right. So, you guys are better at rioting than us. But when it comes to shoppers spending beyond their means, we are still number one. As long as the Chinese let us. But, Todd, we just take calls. We won't have to deal with these mobs of yours. Mobs. Well, yeah, you will. Come on. The only difference is they're going to be on the phone. Guys! Guys! Come on. This is our Super Bowl. All right? So, come ready to play or don't come at all. No. No, you still have to come. It's just, just an expression. Sir, you forgot to mention the incentive memo. You went through my trash? I had no choice. You keep changing your email password. I think we need to be more aggressive. This Black Friday sales incentive says the assistant manager could win a new high definition TV. Yeah, and I could win a trip to Hawaii. But it's never going to happen. Corporate dangles these amazing incentives every year, just to get us to work harder. But if we did work hard enough... No, you don't understand. They set the sales bar so high, it's virtually impossible to win. False hope. How cruel and manipulative. Workers! If anyone can break the sales record, they will receive full health insurance for themselves and their entire family. Huh! They don't even have that in the U.S. Thank you for calling Mid America Novelties. How can I help you? Whoa! Still getting used to your hellos. Just making sure that we're still on for tonight. Yeah, absolutely. Good. Mmm. You better watch out. I'm going to be getting you back tonight, and payback is a bitch! Hey, guys! Crap, it's Charlie. What, you still haven't told him about us? No, I don't want to upset the guy. He's a hard-core hunter. He claims he killed a moose and slept inside it. Ew. Said he would have slept in until noon if it hadn't been mating season. Hey, Todd. Hey. Happy Turkey Day, Tonya. Charlie. Charlie. Are you going camping for Thanksgiving? Nah, this is survival gear. You guys saw the weather forecast, right? Uh, yeah, it's supposed to rain. This ain't no little thunderstorm rolling through the plains. It's a monsoon. Roads get flooded. Power goes out. I sleep here. I've got an air mattress in my office. Big enough for two. I've got a fair idea of how I'll be riding out this storm. Did you see that? She's playing hard to get. It's not that hard. I've had women try to pull this on me before. There's a gal in California right now trying to rope me in. She even went so far as to marry another woman, and they adopted a kid. Not buying it for a second. Did you see that? Thank you. What's this? Chinese checkers? No, it is carom. Looks stupid. I got next. Bam! Oh! Damn it. Two out of three. No. Yeah. Damn it. Three out of five. Oh! Oh, no. Manmeet. Now, you're going to see some carom. Gonna show you how it's done. Damn it. All right. We're going to play a real game. An American game. A man's game. Gupta. Come on, man. Breathe in. Go. Stop it. Tomorrow morning, the battle is joined. You get shot five times, you're dead. Why is yours so much bigger than ours? Why, indeed. Todd, honey, it just wouldn't be Thanksgiving if we didn't get to see you. MR. DEMPSY: I can't see him. Oh. Dad, you've got to lean down. Oh! Hey. You're blurry. I would say call tech support, but you're in India. Why don't you just go out on the street and grab somebody? I just hate to think that it's Thanksgiving, and my little Todd is all alone. Oh, don't worry, Mom. Little Todd is not all alone. Can I meet your mom? Hey, little bro! What's up, buddy? "B-B-B". Big Brad news coming your way. I broke the company sales record. Ho! MR. DEMPSY: That's my boy. And the prize is a ski package at Breckenridge. And I thought, what better gift to give these two for their 30th anniversary? I'm going to give it to you guys. Oh, my goodness. Breckenridge? That's in Colorado. It is, Mom. Yeah. And why don't we just say it's from me and you. Right, Todd? Huh, buddy? Well... Actually, I already got you guys a gift. It's pretty amazing. Yeah? What did you get them? Well, I wasn't going to say anything but I won a trip to Hawaii. And it's all yours. Hawaii? We've never been. Yeah. You know, I broke my company sales record. So, uh, happy anniversary. Oh. Really? You broke a sales record? Yeah, Dad. Why are you always surprised when I win something? Here he goes. Okay. Boys. Boys, we're proud of the both of you. Okay. He did something good. We're trying... Well, congrats, buddy And I think it's best that you give Mom and Dad the gift, anyway. I mean, you're going to go to Hawaii by yourself, huh? Well, actually, I'm dating someone. Really? Is this like Mary Snyder in the seventh grade? The girl who didn't exist? You just carried around a little pink sweater and went, "Oh, I think she's in the bathroom." I'm real, Brad. But I could use a sweater. Oh, my God. You didn't have to do that. But that was pretty awesome. You didn't tell me you broke a sales record. Guys, we have a new sales goal. We have one day to hit this number. One day? That's impossible. Mmm-mmm. Not if everyone stays focused and up-sells. Failure is not an option. I think what Mr. Dempsy is saying is that if you fail, you will bring great dishonor on yourselves. I will build a wall of shame and carve your likeness in it. Decades from now, your children's children will look upon your image and cry hot tears of embarrassment. Way to inspire the troops. I just said what was in my heart. Where the hell are Gupta and Manmeet? I feel like a street cleaner from the future. Yeah! This shouldn't be too hard. Our target is a giant, sweaty white man in a flashing red vest. Oh. Uh... "Two out of three. Damn it. "Three out of five. Damn it. "Eight out of six. Numbers hurt my head." I'm hit. Wait. I may not be so good with numbers. Ahhh! But I can count to five. You're dead. Save yourself, Gupta! Run, Gupta, run! Run, Gupta, run! Manmeet, where have you been? Charlie challenged us to laser tag. Laser tag? Why would you even admit to that? Get back to work now. How ruthless, sir. My compliments. May I ask why the sudden professionalism? I just want to hit our goal. You know? And I think we can do it if we eliminate breaks, personal calls, and have everyone work through lunch. Are you allowed to bring a guest with you to Hawaii? Because I think I'm falling in love with the new Todd. What? No. No! Come on! Not now. Oh! Sir? Hmm? Who said that? It's me, Madhuri. We haven't had a break all day, and we're hungry. Can we go to the canteen to get food? No, I need everyone here for when the power comes back on. You know, if we don't hit the ground running, we're never going to reach our sales goal. Okay. Who wrote "Todd sucks"? I don't know who wrote it, but I know we're all thinking it. Todd, we're tired and hungry. And you're acting like a total Rajiv. Okay. You guys have to stay here, but I'll get food. Would Rajiv do that? Oh! God, Gupta, do that at home. I'm charging my flashlight. I don't care what you call it. This is a pantry. There's food in there. No. It's one of our motion powered lights. Why are you in here, anyway? I'm hiding from Charlie. Give me that gun. Oh. No, but I need my... Come on. Help me get some food for everybody. Oh. Okay, but, uh... Gupta. Did you eat everything in here? I'm being hunted. It's very stressful. Well, since you ate all the food, why don't you go to the canteen and get some snacks for everybody? But it's dangerous in the dark. Perhaps if I had protection? Say, a laser gun? Just take your jack-o-lantern. Charlie? If you're here, I'm getting food for my co-workers. And it's a humanitarian mission. Keep it together. Ahhh! Hi. Just the wind. Remember to breathe. Oh. How can I be hungry again? Oh, no. Come on. Come on. Why is it taking so long? Hmm. So, they do it, too. Come on! Before you finish you, I'm going to finish you. Oh, no! No! No! Charlie, I do not have a gun! Hey! Huh? No! No! MRS. DEMPSY: Happy Thanksgiving, honey. Uh, hey. You, too, Mom. This really isn't the best time. I'm at work right now. Oh, you're at work? Well, I want to see your office and meet everyone. Okay. Okay. Hello, Madam, My name is Rajiv Gidwani. Todd did not inform me he had such a lovely sister. Oh, I like him. He's like a cappuccino Tom Selleck. Okay. Uh, now, this is everybody else. Hello. Nice to meet you, Madam. Hi, Mrs. Dempsy. Oh! Aren't you pretty? Todd, what about her? Okay, Mom, that about wraps her up. Nice meeting all of you. And I wish you a happy Thanksgiving. Thank you. Thank you. Or whatever your holiday is. Were there people in your country before you got there? I googled an image of Mr. Tom Selleck. And may I just say, thank you. It's rare to see another man with a mustache on this level. Oh. Oh, my goodness. Oh, I almost forgot. Todd? I saved you a turkey leg. And I'm going to put it in the freezer. For when you... For when you come... I don't know when you're going to come home, honey. Oh. Come on, Mom. I'm going to double bag it. Oh, God. This nonsense has gone on long enough. Come back. I'll get you a job. I have a job. It's quite a career. Selling fake puke and rubber chickens. Hey, I manage an office, and I have a team of workers who take what we do very seriously. Oh. Hello! Todd, it's time to grow up. Start a real life like your brother. I have a real life. All right? Maybe you'll take me more seriously when I win you that trip to Hawaii. I thought you said you'd already won it. Well, you know, I... There's a time difference, I already won it here. But back home, you guys are, like, eight hours behind. So, it makes... That's great, Todd. Happy Thanksgiving. Where the hell did we go wrong with that one, Sharon? Game over, Gupta. Oh, no. Now, the game is over. You underestimated me. People have been underestimating me my whole life, and that is a mistake. When I put my mind to something, there is nothing that can stop me. Do you smell cookies? I think I do. That's cookies. Here. Dry yourself off. Oh. Thanks, man. I didn't even know we had towels. We don't. Those are the world's largest granny panties. I'm all right. I just needed to get some fresh air. Feel the rain on my face and the dead rats bouncing into my shins. Do we have any tetanus shots in the first aid kit? We do not have a first aid kit. If someone gets hurt, it is cheaper to hire a new worker. Monsoon season is the worst. It is. You know, last year, I got stuck at work and missed my brother's graduation. My parents were so angry. It seems unfair that they push me to work hard and then, blame me when I do. You know? Sir? My parents always thought I could do nothing better than work in a factory. But, then, I got this job, and now, I support my entire family. Sometimes, parents are wrong. When I was 8 years old, I shared a chocolate bar with my dog, Kiki. She ate it greedily and died within seconds. To this day, I cannot help but to think that I may have been at least partly to blame for her demise. What are you doing? We're trying to cheer Todd up. Oh, I just thought we were sharing. You killed that dog, man. Aw, guys, really. I'm going to be okay. Thank you. Todd? I just wanted to say I know how you feel. My parents are pressuring me into getting married. And I'm... I don't know why I never tried some of these Indian desserts before. They're not bad. Deep fried dough is deep fried dough, no matter what country you're in. Sorry I went overboard and hunted you like a deer. But you are brown and eat mostly vegetables. It's okay. Yeah, it doesn't matter now. Look at us. An Indian and a white man breaking bread together. This is just like your Thanksgiving holiday. Hmm. You're right. I don't know if they ever told you what happened right after Thanksgiving. But it went something like this. Pilgrims two, Indians zero. Deep fried dough. So good. Listen up, everybody. So, there's only a couple of minutes left in the day, and it looks like we're going to fall short of our sales goal. But that's okay. You know, we tried. I would like to buy ten farting Santas. I wish to purchase 100 Federal Bikini Inspector badges. I will buy 200 Doodoo Darts. Oh, guys. I appreciate it, but I can't have you spending all your hard-earned money. Oh, thank God. That's a month's salary, man. But what about the bonus trip for your father? Won't you be shamed? I don't care about that anymore. You know, my dad was so convinced that me coming here was a mistake, that he almost had me believing it. You guys proved him wrong. All right. Have a good night, guys. Sit back down. You are not dismissed. Oh, come on, Rajiv. It's been a long day. They've worked their butts off. Let's just call it a night. No, they must maintain their positions. It's still a work day. The power could return at any moment. You see, sir? No one is moving. When I speak, people listen. Because I am not their friend. They respect me and fear me. That is true power. Go, go, go!
