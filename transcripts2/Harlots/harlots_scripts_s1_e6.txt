 Hello, you know what we want! We want some cunny! We want cunny, we want cunny! All right, calm down. I want her. I want her! Emily Lacey is laughing at your fate. Mumma, she can't have known what would happen. She would have killed you stone dead if it had suited her purpose. Let's forget she was ever here. You do that, my treasure.

 What if she finds out where I am? No one here's going to tell her. I left her son swimming in laudanum. She's going to scalp me and skin me and make me into a wig and gloves. I was afraid of that harridan once. But Dame Quigley's like the shadow of a monster. You turn around and face her, you might find the shadow's nothing but a flea. She cannot be seen. Let no one in. It gets easier. Forgive me. I thought you sad.

 I've never had this. It's my own money. It is a solace. It's hope that I can buy back my children. When were you freed, Mr. North? I was born a free Englishman. Foundling. I'm sorry for assuming... This is the trinket my mother left, to know me by when she returned. Only she never did. We must do what we can for Harriet. I feel for her plight, but I must settle my own debt with Mr. Lennox before I can do anything. It galls me that I've got to pay him back so soon. What news, Mr. Lennox? Your country's 122 million pounds in debt. I find that strangely comforting. Your boy may sit over there. Come now, Mr. Lennox, I sit where I please. Mr. North is his own man. I'd have him sit there. Now. Here's 50 pounds of my own national debt repaid. I suggest a weekly repayment of 25 pounds, at a rate of interest to be agreed. There's little to keep me here since my father died. If I have no amusements, I'll go home to Virginia. The interest is continued repayment in kind. Our girls won't have you. I'm sure we can come to some arrangement. It galls them... that you keep your brother and sister as your slaves. Do you presume to lecture me? Come now. Let's take our coffee in a civilized manner. How is it civilized to sit here with a primitive? If you were on my estate, I'd whip the flesh from your back for showing insolence to me. If you weren't such a milksop, I'd do the same to you, right here. Will! I do not accept your terms. I want my money in full this afternoon. Mr. Lennox! You're angry. No... I'm proud of you. But you're angry. I can't get these laced at all. What is it? She has a baby in there. Fanny! You must go to Mrs. Wells. She won't have a baby in the house, you know that. She'll kick me out. Quigley the same. Any girl begins to show and... gone. The way she turned Emily away, it was cruel. And she'll do the same to me. What? Nothing. Are you gossiping spite about my mother? You'd be fucking in the gutter if it wasn't for her. You want to wash your mouth out. And you want to wash out your crack. Don't you dare speak to me like that. Take your breakfast and go to your room. This is my house. Well, your mother's left me in charge and I say go to your room. Leave your cares on the threshold and enter our house of revels. Harriet and Marie-Louise are with culls, two more await. I can take one, but why can't Lucy take the other? She gave me a mouthful of vexatious language and I sent her to her room. Where's Fanny? She's out. Buying condoms. Stop vexing Kitty, you bad shrimp. I need your answer for Lord Fallon. Will you make me have him? No. Of course I won't. Won't never get such an offer again, though. What will happen if I say no? No good will ever come out of being Mrs. Quigley's creature. I'm glad to hear you say it. We'll leave as soon as you're able. We cannot. God will provide. She holds me in pincers. She has me writhing on the lies that I have told. And in my fever, one thing became clear: Only the truth will free me. What lies? I have drawn a veil across my past. I am a sinner, child. We are all sinners. No, no! I was once an obscene and shameful... I was once a... The things I did! Oh, Mother... God scourged me. This mist He sent across my eyes. No amount of crying will ever wash me clean. You were once a harlot? Your father could be one of twenty men. I've lied. I've lied, I've lied, I've lied, I've lied! It doesn't matter. God sent me a daughter. You've saved me. Emily Lacey's sheltering at mine. I won't help her. You have money now. You can pay off her debt to Quigley. No, no, no. You have to, Mags. He warned me not to kick that nest. Advice I should have taken. We both know what it's like to be immured at Quigley's. We fought her off, two green girls. She should do the same. She's alone. We had each other. I need your help. Oh, Nance. That girl's not worthy of your care. Quigley'll kill her. When we escaped, we talked into the night about the kind of bawd it might be possible to be, and you said... I've tried to be that bawd, you know I have. ... you said we should sustain and defend each other. We do. You have the standing now to properly oppose that woman. You have five minutes of my time, madam. What do you want? I can see how it's gone. One zealous Spartan squeezes too hard, feels a thrilling power, and a girl dies. He wants the others to share his crime, and truth be told, there are one or two with a thirst to try. So another girl must be found, and then another, until they are united... in their deed. They have me trapped. I cannot free myself. I have the most perfect girl for them. The Spartans are in for some very fine sport. Do I understand you correctly? They won't be able to restrain themselves. And they won't need to; this girl deserves her fate. Lydia, let us be very clear. 'Tis their murder, not ours. These men have formidable power. Yes, and we're offering them godlike power, the power of life and death. Discreetly provided. Our price must be knowing who they are. I can't have it, I'll be thrown out. Well, why didn't you come to me sooner? This baby's almost ready to be born. It can't be, that's not right. Here's its head. And there's its back. Who can help you, Fanny? You got a mother or a sister? I can't have it! There's no more denying it, my love. Your baby's coming. What's the matter? Have you lost your dazzle? I'm out on my heels, Nancy. I can't get another keeper. Well, go home to your ma. She'll help you. I'll get nothing but tribulation from her. She'd do anything for you. Damn peculiar way of showing it. Well, are you looking for a start at my place? Maybe. Just go to your ma. I wanted you to know, my lord, what she was like. Out of my sight. I contended daily with her lustful onslaughts. Brutus! Traitor! She goaded me with wanton proposals whenever your back was turned. She was like a succubus upon my soul. My loyalty is to you and your house. It was not readily I fell. You need to eat, or the gin'll corrode you. I want nothing from you. You suck wormwood from Quigley's dugs. You should learn who your friends are. Then you might survive. Sir George. We're honored. Get me the Wells mother. My ties and obligations to Charlotte Wells are cut. She's a wild and reckless girl. I've often told her so. I want Lucy. Well. I'm sure she could comfort you. Allow me to prepare a room. I want her for my mistress. The town will see how little I care for Charlotte Wells. You'd be Lucy's keeper. Yes. Now. This is most unexpected. Bring her. When we've agreed on my terms. I've had a fat and fruitful offer from Lord Fallon for my Lucy. What's your price? A hundred pounds on her head, another at the week's end, a stipend of 400 yearly. And should you ever tire of her, a pension for the same. Lucy is exceptional. She'll adorn your arm by day and treasure you at night. I was the first man ever to touch her. Do you agree to my terms? I do. Then she's yours. I'll go and tell her the happy news. I want to. No, I must. She will need time to compose herself. Are you deaf? Look who I've brought to see you. I have joyful tidings. You belong to me. Sir George wants Lucy as his mistress. What of Charlotte? She's arming against him. Lucy's made. I like your simplicity, your willingness to gratify and honor me. You're a girl I could form in the flame of my own will. Is Charlotte... Don't mention her name again. Am I to leave here... and live in your house? Yes, of course you are. You're moved, I can see it. I've changed your fate in a single stroke. Like an idol, like a god. Abandon yourself to me. No. Yes, you must. I'm now your master and your lord. Don't affect coyness. I want my mother. Your modesty's out of place. Do not refuse me. You may not ever refuse me. No! Mrs. Wells! Mrs. Wells! What did you do to her? I didn't touch her! What'd you do? Nothing I didn't pay you for! The harlot stuck me, she's mad! You must have hurt her. I didn't touch her! Oh, god! Get her out. Go with Pa. Why did you not tell me she's mad? Let me see to your wound, sir. All will be well. Get me out to my coachman. If you exert yourself, the bleeding will worsen tenfold. Be still, be calm. Kitty, go to Wardour Street and fetch Dr. Rodney. I'm going to go and get you some water and something for the pain. Please don't move. Kitty! You can't get a surgeon. You can't get anyone. No one must know. He'll bleed to death. You might save him, Kitty, if you go. But Lucy, she'll be lost. They will hang her. I'll clear the house of culls. No. Everything must go on as normal. Go and tell the coachman Sir George has decided to stay for the day. Make sure he leaves. The surgeon is sent for. Kitty is running like the wind. Please, you must rest. I want my man Haxby. You'll be right as a gun in no time. Just rest. Send the coach... I want Haxby. I'll ask Mr. North to go directly. Lucy, I must go. Your ma needs me. Mr. North, I... I need to speak to you. Not now. What's wrong with her? She cannot tell you. Sit with her. Are you feeling guilty for being a nasty slit? This'll help with the pain. How is he? Strong as an ox. All will be well. What keeps the surgeon? Let's find out, shall we? I never sent for one. You'll let him die? I must save Lucy. She'll be charged with murder, not just wounding. They'll hang her for wounding him anyway. He attacked her. Pleasure is this way, sir. It's his word versus ours. She's still a child. Justice will have mercy. She's a harlot, and they will hang her anyway. If we don't save him, Lucy will be damned. Her soul will burn for murder. You must go. Go! I've come for my girl, where's my girl? We paid our debt for the girl and now she's ours. Not the French piece, Emily Lacey! She came to us in a dreadful state. Said you'd beaten her obscenely. So Margaret Wells has been foolish enough to take her in. We gave her some comfort and sent her on her way. I told her I wanted no conflict with you. So leave my house, or conflict there will be. Look at your neck. You'd always blotch red when you lied. I speak truth. Your skin is florid with deceit. She is here. Get out. Emily Lacey, I'm coming for you! Get out of my house! Even if I knew where she was... and I don't... I'd rather cut out my tongue than give her over to you. She tried to kill Charles! I'm sorry to hear that. But I tell you, Emily Lacey is not in this house. Consider yourself under siege. Apologies, sir, if your pleasure's been disturbed. This way. I'm sorry. You should be manacled and branded. Lucy, Lucy! Mrs. Wells. Constable. I've come for my Fanny. Where's my surgeon? He's very close. Now, you must take something for the pain. Not too much, now. Mother. It's Mrs. Quigley. I can tell by the smell of rotting lilies. What happened? Who did this? You did. You poisoned the girl against me. He wanted Lucy as his mistress. You sold him Lucy? How much did you get? What does it matter? It is done. How much money? I did it for Lucy. This is your doing. Curse you. Howard! I hope you die in anguish. You are vile. Charlotte! I need you. Do you not think I'm scourging myself? He blames me. It's my fault. You nor Lucy will take the blame. I need you to get Nancy for me. Please help me. There is no surgeon. You'll sit and watch me die. No. No! No, my lord. Shh, shh. It's my murder now. It'll be me who'll burn. We need to burn the linen, clean the blood from the room. Do as you want. I'm asking for your help. Now? When it's too late? I weighed everything you said. Go your own way, Margaret. You always will. I did it for Lucy! We'll hang, both of us along with her. We'll hang for this. It's Ma. Go! I've come for my money. Wait there. I'm going home to Virginia. What of my children? You may purchase them until tomorrow. How? I sail on the evening tide. Benjamin, please. I implore you in the name of God, give them to me. They are your own blood, I beg you! What an exhibition you are. Mr. North. Pay for my children. Don't let him make them slaves. For her children. Please. When my mother was still dying in her bed, you whored yourself to my father. He sent me away because of you. Take the money, Mr. Lennox. Your mongrels are mine by law. You are a monster, a monster! Do nothing you will regret. He longs to destroy you. Go after him, don't let him take them! I'll do all I can. Help me, please! I will, I promise. But now, be calm. The business of the house must go on. I cannot see culls, how could you think it? Harriet! I give you my word, he will not take your children. But now, I need you to help me. Please. I can sense your despair. I can smell it. You're an awfully tedious whore. Oh... I have been blessed by God. I am soaring with joy. I'm free. There are no secrets between my daughter and I. So I quit your service... as of now. Your daughter is indeed a very fine girl. She is an angel. Do you not fear for her? Such a pretty thing out all alone on these dangerous streets. Of course I fear for her. I hear of abominable things happening to girls just like her. Even you would not be so low as to threaten my child. As long as you remain in my employ. Oh, what a wonderful helpmeet you are for your mother. I'm sure she'd be inconsolable without you. I am your servant, Mrs. Quigley. He'll stiffen soon. We must remove him, as soon as it gets dark. What are you doing? Taking my fee. We'll make it look like he was set upon by thieves. Lucy, look after your mother. She just killed a man for you. You don't seem your usual self. In truth, I like you better than any other man. Mr. Armitage... You're a balm for sore spirits. You all right? The offer you made me, to start again on another shore, was it real? Are you in earnest? You once told me that a harlot did nothing but pretend. I can't pretend, I want to leave. To leave London? With you. The way you sit, watching her house. Your obsession with her eats you. What is it born of? You took Margaret Wells when she was a child. How can it be hate that drives you? It is love. Enough of your impertinence, you sightless wretch. If you care for your mother, you will watch that house all night. I will do nothing more for you. And when she discovers that you kissed tongues with black harlots at brothel masquerades, what then? Watch for Emily Lacey. Howard's dead, I'm sure of it. You need to be far away from here before circumstance imperils you. We need money. I wasn't lucky at the tables tonight, how much do you have? What I'm in. But where are your savings? The gifts and the jewels, the wages from all the nights you spent with him? I don't have any. You took nothing with you? I couldn't. But he owes you! We can't arrive in America with nothing. We're going to take what you're due. No. I'm not watching you gnawing with hunger or selling yourself to every brute of New York. If you're in earnest, we need money. The whole street will witness him leave. Deep in his cups. A fine night was had by all. Are you trying to get my property out? I don't know where she is. Stop lying, little Maggie. Give me Emily. She's at Nancy's. That's my good girl. You always tell Mumma the truth... in the end. Who was it? Scanwell and her daughter. I told her to go and preach up my arse. Covent Garden. Very good, ma'am. Two shillings! Bobby! Leave me alone. Bobby, I miss your dirty whore-pipe. I want it up my sweet nutmeg cunny. I can't be seen with you. There are eyes everywhere watching. Well, then let's do it in a bed. Jacob. You cannot take the boy. We need a link boy to light our way. Everything must look normal. I've come for my things. You do not live here anymore. Let's go. The lady's come for her property. "Lady"? I see only a trollop. It's a mortal sin to defraud a workman of his wages. Charlotte, get your things. Let's go. It doesn't matter. I hope she gives you pleasure, as she willingly gave me. Whatever will become of you, Betsey? You're a mayfly. I worry that you'll only live for a day... Yes, yes! Oh, don't die. Don't die. No, Betsey! Tell your cull to help! Betsey! Please! No! No... how did you find me? What hag told you I was here? Your dear friend Margaret Wells. No! Help me! So. We have nothing. That's not quite true, is it? You're right. I've found a treasure. A cheap one. I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to mean it. How to be true. There's no money in the room. That should make it simple enough. Is the man asleep? Yes, fast asleep. Synced & corrected by Monkeymannn
