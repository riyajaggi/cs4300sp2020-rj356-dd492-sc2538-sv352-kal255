 I was forced to sell her. I needed the hundred pounds for our move. This has always been Lucy's future. She was rushed into it. That Lydia bitch Quigley. She's heard about my Greek Street House and she's trying to keep me down. It's a huge leap; a vast expense. We're down to two girls. This move is too much risk. Lydia Quigley has her girls sucking the law, the clergy,

 and the whole King's bench! If she kicks me, I'll bite her back. So what brought you to London? I was in the navy. Might've known. Were you in the war? Tail end of it. In Guadeloupe, Havana. West Indies. What did you see? The inside of a ship, mostly. Green islands, land I never walked on, and fish.

 The fish were profoundly amazing. How? That's it, the hour's up now. You must pay for another to hear about the fish. You're learning, Mr. Marney. You'll make a harlot of me yet. I'm not buying. Thank you for your company, Ms. Wells. Charlotte, before you say a word... it was an error! You're referring to my sister? Did you deflower her? Yes. And it wasn't an error until after? It was a direct result of your behavior towards me yesterday! I'm going to pack, you can order me a coach. Charlotte, it was nothing. I spent the whole time thinking of you! Oh, please. I'm deranged with love. Don't leave me. I'd look a fool in front of the whole town! Is that what troubles you? I know I can't make you love me but stay with me. You can have anything. I only ever asked for your trust. You have it, you have it. I trust you! Please. You've roused the serpent. The serpent has been bad, I don't want to see him. He's a very sorry serpent. He wants to tell you so, in person. What will he give me, to prove his contrition? A ring... of pearl and gold. Is he going to pay my gaming debts? Yes, all of them. Then he may have some fruit. George! Lydia Quigley. She could attack me again, that citadel of quim in Golden Square. Do you really want to kick that nest? You know? A host of wasps may rise to sting you. How old is that fish? It's turning my stomach. It ain't the fish making you sick. You were just like this when you put Charlotte on the town. Lucy must have Repton. I sold her twice. Don't know how to tell her. Only twice? Shut up, Filth! Her renown might be her weakness. Quigley's? Well, you could attack her reputation. I could have a notion that would hurt her custom. Do you remember Mary Cooper? She was a shining star at Quigley's. You snore like a piglet. I've got every right to snore. I was tupped in half last night. I'm on my way to earning myself a fortune. You've got this to pay for first. Quigley puts it on your debt. Your meals, your room. She takes it from your money. We think "Oh yes, I will get rich..." but Mrs. Quigley, only she gets rich. Count Heinrich was thrilled with Miss Lacey last night. I think she'll earn her body-weight in gold. I'm glad you're thinking. It's a good activity for you, my dear. I pray you'll indulge in it more often. Justice Cunliffe. Mistress Lydia. I thought your only current mistress was the law. I am in need of a girl. Ever the overkeen schoolboy. Take one. Not that kind of a girl. I have some new friends. They're looking for something more... immaculate. A sweet, untouched hanging risk? Why would I need that kind of peril? The peril is the adventure, surely. You mistake me for a gull. I have told my new friends that you are unsurpassed. They will pay whatever you ask. Impress them. And doors would open for you, as they are opening for me. What becomes of her after? I have no concern for after. Still a peach... under all that powder. Up, up! You got gainful employment. My cunny needs a cursed rest. I want feet, not cunny. I want eyes. What for? You ever heard tell of Mary Cooper? Mary Cooper, Mary Cooper She's had every Lord and Trooper Kisses scorch, her waps are super I heard she'd fallen on hard times. You go find her. Your very first lover. How are you? It was nothing. Did we get enough? For the new house? We very... very nearly did. So we didn't? But fortunately, when the baronet made his bid for you, I had already accepted one. From Lord Repton. So that's twice for your maidenhead. For you. Garters, we made them. To welcome you to the ranks. You always remember your first time, Lucy. Well, you'll never know what it means, to have a woman like Charlotte Wells. Such bliss is only for the chosen few. Well, here are some of her promissory notes. Pay them. There's more than fifty pounds here! Yes, she's a very poor gambler. My lord, the chosen few... may not be as exclusive as you think. What do you mean? The Irishman who escorted her home... it wasn't exactly a kiss that I saw. Do you know God? Has He knocked upon your heart? And in the hour of your beauty, did you turn Him away? You need Him now, don't you? Say a prayer for a poor harlot? Crime of impurity is certainly deep down. Here. Just ask yourself... You are loved. "How can I commit this sin against God?" Any of you wretches know Mary Cooper? Mary Cooper? Who's Nathaniel Lennox? A friend. He went to America, must be 20 years. Asking for you in the tavern. Nat Lennox? So he's back? Must be down on his luck. He was telling the assembled company of his fine plantation and his thousand slaves. Well... Strange you never mentioned him. I've been sitting here desponding, Will, thinking how we gonna find enough money? And sometimes, God just fills your glass, doesn't he? Here, look, it's Mary Cooper. Is she dead? Touch her. You touch her. Excuse me, sir, I'm looking for work. This is the place, my dear. There's always housekeeper looking for staff. Next! I'm here to find work. A housemaid perhaps. Forgive me. If you were not a stranger here, you would know that woman is an infamous bawd. Oh. She would feast on your innocence and force you into a life of depravity. London is full of perils, my dear. I have a vacant position for the right maid. I wonder... are you she? Perhaps you are! Is your master in? I am the mistress of this house. Must have the wrong door. I'm looking for Nathaniel Lennox. Mr. Lennox is my husband. Oh. Come sit down, come on. Mr. Lennox has often spoken of you. Really? Harriet knows all about us. I never thought I'd see you again. You are in trade, Mrs. Wells, are you not? I have a boarding house for young ladies. How admirable. I have plans to expand. Oh, you always had plans. Got my eye on a fine house in Greek Street. You might find it an intriguing prospect. A business prospect. Maggie, I want to see you for pleasure. When might it please you? Maggie, stop that! Abigail, take them upstairs. Lovely children you have. I have a boy just like. Tomorrow I want you to meet my eldest son. He's a bit... I think your house might suit him. You're welcome too, Mrs. Lennox. No, Harriet won't come. She knows me, don't you, my love? Mr. Lennox has educated me extremely well. Who have you left behind? Just my sister. Oh! No sweetheart? No. Because I'm most particular about the kind of girls I employ. There's no one. I'm not like that. You're innocent, aren't you? Just as I was once myself. Now without further ado, I shall go and get my gentlemen and they'll explain exactly how you are to be employed. Intact. I pledge my fidelity. I solemnly swear my loyalty to you. Alas, I've some wearisome news. What is it? My Aunt Beatrice once revealed her breasts to me while I was attempting a Latin translation. They were like cow's tongues. She's dead. My mother commands my presence. You're leaving me, again? I must, in case the hag has left me any coinage. Haxby will escort you while I'm gone. I've told him not to leave your side. I don't like Haxby. I won't tolerate that servile prig spying on me. And I won't tolerate you slobbering over Irish louts on my doorstep! Follow her like a faithful dog, whether she wants it or no. So, you're my dog. Here boy. Here. Sit. Will I get a treat, Miss Wells? I don't think you're a dog at all, Mr. Haxby. I think you're a bitch. Lord Fallon, Viscount Grayling. Between them, they own Berkshire. My mother delights in little secrets, so find out whatever you can. I say. It's French. And where are you from, Missy? The gutter. They've polished me up, but I'm still exceeding dirty. Let's see, get her up. Come up, Mary. Shining star, my ass. Oh, you're all right, we'll get you in now. Come on, bring her in. Little gift for Mags. Mary Cooper. You are not bringing that in here. See what Quigley does to her girls? Got rid of her as soon as she got ill. It's the French Pox, Will. You'd have to fuck her to get it. Tuppence. No good will come of this. God himself would approve. He may, but I don't. Help yourself, gentlemen. I'm going to eat your fruit. You look absolutely divine, my dear. Thank you. You are a delight. Sugar pigs! Mumma. Grayling is borrowing from Fallon. Who found it out? Emily Lacey. She's utterly bedazzling. So my beloved Emily has gone? Lydia Quigley's got her. That's terrible. How can I afford her in Golden Square? Your distress should go beyond her price, Mr. Holland. This is what happens to Quigley's girls. "Mary Cooper spun straw into gold "for a well known widow of Golden Square." Say "kidnapping pimp," not "widow." And say "Lydia Quigley." I cannot name her directly. Well, then call her "Dame Death." But make it clear that Mary caught the French Pox under her roof. Do we know that to be true? Use your arts! How hard is it to pay for washing? I'll be with you just now, handsome. We're so busy. Can't you help? Not allowed. I have to keep myself pure for Lord Reptile. Your maidenhead's gone on that baronet's maypole. What's pure about you now? Kitty! You said you always remember your first time. What was yours? One of my father's... friends saw I was alone and forced himself upon me. That's my memory. I didn't mean to antagonize you. There are so many ways in which you are a stupid, stubborn woman. Will, Quigley must be stood up to! I must strike back! If we attack Lydia Quigley, she will retaliate with all the power at her disposal! So think hard... before you make that dying girl your weapon. "Infection was Mary's reward, "for disease respects nor rich nor poor. "It lingers when the sport is done "and may still hang like a pestilent mist "over the heartless madam's pleasure house in Golden Square." "Ejected by this fiendish madam, "who we can only call 'Dame Death,' "Mary was taken in by M. W., "a kindly widow of Covent Garden, "who is comforting her in her final hours." M.W.? Margaret Wells, ha! Blimey, Mrs. Wells took her in. Well, I never! Miss Lacey. She didn't get the pox here, did she? I don't want it. When I want fatuous, dull-witted commentary, I will buy a parrot. So you're using me in a fight with Mrs. Quigley. No one uses me... unless they pay. I beg your pardon? You'd have died yesterday if it weren't for me. I want more gin! I want laudanum. Now listen... I want five pounds and I want a roast chicken! Do not make demands. Or I shall walk out on that street and tell all London how I love good Lydia Quigley. I wasn't even ill 'til I left her house. I caught this pox on Cheapside. Say nothing. Are you a virgin? Are you a harlot? They say you only remember your first time. Would you like to remember me? You'll have to pay. I need it for food. What's your name? Jem Curran. I am Lucy Wells. Famed courtesan. Give me your money and I'll make you a man. What use is moaning? I've saved you from a life of drudgery. One day you'll be grateful. Look how much money the gentlemen paid, more than you'd earn in a year as a housemaid. Oh, enough whining! I'm having a dreadful day. Stop that noise! Now... this lady will take you to your new place of work and give you a nice room and a pretty dress. Thirty! Twenty. Thirty, or may cancer strike you. "When I want fatuous and dull-witted commentary, "I simply talk to my son!" You insolent jade. Oh, don't be vexed; we were just idling, for lack of custom. All of you, leave us. Now! I've been your champion since you got here. Hm. I feel villainous. And I deserve every bit of your righteous passion. Oh, oh yes! Oh, Mr. Quiggy! You're my man! Oh yes! Oh, Mr. Quiggy! Mumma! Chariots of hell. There's no custom, Mumma. The Prussian Embassy sent a card. They're not coming. What are you smiling about, Missy? Ooh, mind your pockets! Where does this filthy labyrinth lead? To my sister, Mr. Haxby. This is my home. Hello, sprat. I've come to see how you are. Not a sprat any more. Oh? Charlotte! Where have you been; get in! How are you, Pa? Where's Sir George? This is Mr. Haxby, his spy. We'll have no spying here, sir. This is a decent cunny house. We must impress this client. He's on his way. Betsey, Violet, no mere pintle-grabbing; you're not on the streets now. When we get in there, everyone witty and reclining. Where's my cursed laudanum, you cunny-licking witch? I want my poppy! I beg you, take your spy in there and keep this trollop quiet. Get her our of sight. Mary, remember me? Oh, Charlotte, what does a whore have to do to get some poppy in this dump? Mary? You've had some adventures since I last saw you. You mean I look like a bunter? Mr. Haxby, this is Mary. Oh. She was my friend. You got any poppy, mister? No. Are you Charlotte's cull? No, he's just a little drudge. Tupping his overlord. So what's that like? I've known it worse. Well, I haven't; I can't get a cockless leper. Welcome to the sanctuary. Leave your worries and woes on the threshold and enter our house of recreation. Oh, I like that. This must be why you have sent for me. My daughter read it to me and I presume you're feeling libeled. Never presume to know how I'm feeling. God has made me a vessel for truth, and I must speak it. You live in my property rent-free! I am your God now, Mrs. Scanwell, and you will speak your truth for me! I have taken your house for the sake of my daughter... and I will do your bidding... but you will always hear God's truth from me. You're a scorpion, Mrs. Scanwell; that's the only truth that matters, and I've asked you to sting Margaret Wells. Such things take time. The time is today. You can find your own way out. Can this really be the place? It's a common cathouse. When I was your age... That's the only one worth taking. I'll have her. That is my very own daughter, Lucy. And she's currently promised to another But here is Miss Fletcher. She is very similar of age and demeanor. I'm also available. Get in there, Fanny! Oh! Forgive my modesty. I was a virgin until yesterday. The girl smells of stale liquor. The black's your choice, isn't she? What did you say? Have they all got manners as foul as yours in America? Don't be offended. My father's always favored a savage kind of whore. One more word and I will send you out of this room like the child you are! I've a little sister who'll grow up just like you. Get out, Benjamin. Out! Boy gives me indigestion. I like your house, Maggie. Your girls are cut from your cloth. Imagine how well we'd do, if we had a bit of silk? You should take one of them upstairs. Miss Carter would suit you, she's an angel. Maggie, it isn't Miss Carter or Miss Anyone-else I've come here to see. Surely you know that. It's you. He wants me. Fuck. I haven't been with another man since 1758. Have you come to ask me if I mind? Give it back, you fuckin' weasel! I'll punch you... How goes the play, my lord? Badly. Emily Lacey is, at this moment, playing with her perfect breasts waiting to be skewered on your pointed weapon. The Ledger says there's a French Pox in your house. That's a lying rag; our girls are clean. I swear, Quigley, if I pick up anything from one of your whores, I'll choke you on a mercury cure. Time's done its work on me. On us both. I was so in love with you, Maggie. Tell me... was it only my money? When you went away... I was inconsolable. This whore is condemned by God. Her sins are dragging her down. How can you speak so brutally? I speak true. All harlots are damned. You're right, Mary, he is the devil. So how much you gonna lend me then, for my new house? Don't let him take me! Mary Cooper, fuck off! This lady's been waiting to see you. I trust there is no trouble with our business. None. Then what in the name of all sense brings you here? A vile attempt... to blacken my name. I fail to see how this concerns me. Margaret Wells is behind it. You could have had her whipped and transported but you left her at liberty. Justice cannot stoop to a pointless vendetta between two bawds. What exactly did justice stoop to when it asked me to kidnap an innocent girl? This is a trifling matter, madam. Take your scandal sheet and go. Forgive me. I do not have the superior force of male reason willing my actions. As you and your powerful friends do. O God of Spirits and of all flesh... who hast trodden down death and overcome the evil one... You had the trick of making everyone look your way. Take, O Lord, the soul of this sinner, Mary. 'Tis within the power of your grace to save her from perdition... You can stop now. She's dead. What do you want? Tell Dame Death Mary Cooper's dead. Get out. Tell her not to show her face in Covent Garden 'cause there's a lot of girls who want to rip her eyes out. What is it between Mrs. Wells and your mumma? I'm very busy. How? Seein' as we've got no culls. Tell me the tale of Mrs. Wells. It's none of your business. You don't know it, do you? We should put some powder on her. Let's not hide what life did to her. God preserve us all from a fate like Mary Cooper's. Narrow is the path we tread and grave are the dangers. Mary Cooper reminds us of how brief our dance in the candlelight can be. The Lord has punished her sins! May He punish those who sinned against her! May He punish Dame Death! Yes! Margaret Wells. Whoremaker! Girlseller! Childspoiler! The annihilating angel is coming for you. You're damned. As surely as the husk of depravity you carry to her tomb. Mary Cooper lit up this town like a flare! Yeah! And for those who damn us, us, I say be damned! Mary Cooper! Mary Cooper... Mary Cooper. She's had every Lord and Trooper Mary Cooper, Mary Cooper Leaves her lovers in a stupor Ridin' high, no man can dupe her London's Venus, Mary Cooper My first harlot's coins, Mary. My pleasure, ladies. I looked down into the waters and saw fish... so bright they hurt my eyes. Little jewels, some smaller than minnows, some bigger than pigs. It was another world down there, a green and blue Eden. This life is full of wonder, Charlotte Wells. Feel the scourge of remorse. Abase yourself at God's feet. Implore him for forgiveness and in His mercy He may save your filthy soul. Come on, Bets, stop your acting. Hatred, strife, murders, and drunkenness will follow you, every day of your life! I love you too. Shame on you! God have mercy on you. Once a bobtail, always a bobtail! I thought I could walk away this afternoon but... I can't. I always knew you were grasping my money. Nat. You want me to invest in your house? Then I shall. Come and see me tomorrow afternoon and we'll talk. Show me what you've got and I'll show you what I've got. How's that for you? Violet tells me there's not a soul in Quigley's house tonight. Place is like a morgue. Give the man money, Mr. Haxby. A coin for a gentleman! I will not. Oh, come on then, show us what you've got. What's in your britches? Nothing but the Book of Common Prayer. You are shamefully drunk! Your hat, Mr. Haxby. She was a proper fucking minx, that one. May the pox strike her down. I once made the mistake of treating Margaret Wells like my own. I took her into my home. She betrayed me. Had me arrested on a vindictive charge; kidnapping. I could have hanged. That woman is pure menace. Calling at this hour. Out of my way! Synced & corrected by Monkeymannn
