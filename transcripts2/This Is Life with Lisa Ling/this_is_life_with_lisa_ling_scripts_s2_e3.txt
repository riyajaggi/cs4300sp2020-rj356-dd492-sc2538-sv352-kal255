 I'M IN EAST LOS ANGELES SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF MEN. HA! LAW ENFORCEMENT CALLS THEM A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION. THEY ARE A NOTORIOUS GROUP WITH A VIOLENT HISTORY. WE DEMAND RESPECT. WE DON'T TAKE FROM NOBODY. AN OUTLAW BIKER CLUB THAT'S AT WAR WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY'RE TRYING TO DECIMATE ALL 1% MOTORCYCLE CLUBS. THEY ARE HIGHLY SECRETIVE. I THINK I'D JUST RATHER NOT SAY.

 NO COMMENT? OKAY. AND THEY'VE NEVER LET THE MEDIA INSIDE THEIR WORLD UNTIL NOW. NICE TO MEET YOU. THESE ARE THE MONGOLS. THEY WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW WHO THEY REALLY ARE... HONOR, LOYALTY, AND RESPECT! OOH-AH! ...SO THEY'RE GRANTING ME UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS TO THEIR CLUB. THIS IS LIFE WITH LISA LING - SEASON 2 EP 3 - Inside Mongol Nation WE'RE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS OUT OF WACO, TEXAS, WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A SHOOTING, WE'RE TOLD, BETWEEN BIKER GANGS. AT LEAST FIVE MOTORCYCLE GANGS GATHERED

 AT WACO'S TWIN PEAKS RESTAURANT. NINE PEOPLE ARE DEAD, MORE THAN 170... ON MAY 17, 2015, HUNDREDS OF BIKERS CONVENED AT A RESTAURANT IN WACO, TEXAS. NINE PEOPLE DEAD... BEFORE LONG, THE GATHERING GAVE WAY TO THE DEADLIEST BIKER BRAWL IN RECENT HISTORY. IT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY HOW IT STARTED, BUT MANY BULLETS WERE FIRED, SOME BY POLICE. WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARED, ONE MEMBER OF THE BANDIDOS MOTORCYCLE CLUB AND EIGHT MEMBERS OF A RIVAL CLUB WERE DEAD. LAW ENFORCEMENT IMMEDIATELY HEIGHTENED SURVEILLANCE ON MOTORCYCLE CLUBS NATIONWIDE. PARTICULARLY ON THOSE KNOWN AS ONE-PERCENTERS... AN ELITE GROUP OF BIKER CLUBS THAT CONSIDER THEMSELVES THE TOUGHEST AROUND. THE GOVERNMENT CLASSIFIES THESE CLUBS AS CRIMINAL GANGS. THEY INCLUDE THE BANDIDOS, THE HELLS ANGELS, AND A GROUP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN AFTER FOR YEARS... ...THE MONGOLS. THIS EAST L.A.-BASED CLUB DENIES ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY'RE CRIMINALS, AND THEY WANT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. ONE-PERCENTER CLUBS ALMOST NEVER GIVE INTERVIEWS, BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, WE'VE BEEN INVITED TO EMBED WITH THE MONGOLS. THEY'RE CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND BADDEST CLUBS OUT THERE, BUT THEY WANT US TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE REALLY ABOUT NOW. SO, THE FIRST THING THEY'VE INVITED US TO IS FAMILY FUN DAY. POTATO SACK RACE, MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE SOCCER FIELDS. FROM WHAT I CAN SEE, FAMILY FUN DAY IS EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE... WIVES, KIDS, POTATO SALAD, AMUSEMENTS, AND A FEW HUNDRED HARD CORE BIKERS. YOU GUYS WANT SOME? THAT'S A REAL BIKER RIGHT HERE. DAVID SANTILLAN IS THE MONGOLS' NATIONAL PRESIDENT. NEARLY EVERYONE IN THE CLUB IS GIVEN A NICKNAME, AND HIS IS LIL DAVE. WHEN YOU DO NORMAL EVENTS, YOU'RE NORMALLY NOT DRESSED IN SHORTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT, RIGHT? RIGHT, WE'RE USUALLY, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ON OUR BIKES, SO WE'RE WEARING JEANS, BOOTS, AND OUR VESTS WITH OUR PATCHES ON. AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO NOT SHOW YOUR COLORS ON A DAY LIKE THIS? WE'D LIKE TO SAY SO WE WON'T ATTRACT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ATTENTION, BUT AS YOU SEE, LAW ENFORCEMENT'S STILL HERE. IS THIS TYPICAL? AT TIMES, IT IS, BUT RIGHT NOW, IN LIGHT OF WACO, TEXAS, AND WHAT HAPPENED, I GUESS LAW ENFORCEMENT'S AT LIKE A HEIGHTENED LEVEL. BUT, REALLY, AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE NO THREAT. EVERY TIME WE GO TO AN EVENT, WE POLICE OUR OWN PEOPLE, WE CLEAN UP AFTER OURSELVES BETTER THAN THE NORMAL CITIZEN. THEY'RE JUST WASTING THEIR TIME. I MEAN, THEY SHOULD BE OUT THERE CHASING REAL CRIMINALS. YOU KNOW? DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS JUST BE PLAGUED BY YOUR PAST? THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE THAT STIGMA HANGING OVER OUR HEAD. WE'RE THE MONGOLS MOTORCYCLE CLUB. THE MONGOLS CAME ON THE SCENE IN 1969 WHEN A GROUP OF LATINO VIETNAM VETS WERE ALLEGEDLY DENIED ACCESS TO THE NATION'S MOST INFAMOUS BIKER CLUB, THE HELLS ANGELS. THOSE VETS STARTED THEIR OWN CLUB, AND LIKE GENGHIS KHAN'S MONGOL ARMY, THEY REFUSED TO LET ANYONE STAND IN THEIR WAY. THEY JOINED THE 1% OF BIKER CLUBS THAT LIVE OUTSIDE THE RULES OF THE AMERICAN MOTORCYCLE ASSOCIATION AND PROUDLY CALL THEMSELVES OUTLAWS. TODAY, THE MONGOLS HAVE CHAPTERS ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND ALTHOUGH THEY'RE UNDER CONSTANT SCRUTINY FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, THEIR MEMBERSHIP CONTINUES TO EXPAND. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN PART OF THE CLUB? I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THAT MEANS I'M FIGHTING TO EARN MY WAY IN. AND SO WHAT KINDS OF... CAN I ASK WHAT KINDS OF THINGS YOU DO AS A PROSPECT? PICK UP TRASH, SERVE BEER. DID YOU DO THAT, AS WELL? WERE YOU A PROSPECT? YES, I DID. YEAH, YOU DON'T JUST COME IN FOR FREE, YOU KNOW? AND JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, WHY THE MONGOLS? I WAS IN IRAQ '07, '08. JUST THE BROTHERHOOD THING IS SOMETHING THAT I ALWAYS WANTED WHEN I GOT OUT. ARE THEIR SIMILARITIES BETWEEN A MOTORCYCLE CLUB AND THE MILITARY? I COULD POINT OUT ANY BROTHER HERE RIGHT NOW, AND THEY'VE GOT MY BACK 100%. SAME THING AS THE MILITARY. I MEET ANOTHER YOUNG MEMBER WHO INTRODUCES HIMSELF AS "DEAD MAN." HOW DID YOU GET THE NAME DEAD MAN? 'CAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY NOT YOUR BIRTH NAME, RIGHT? NO, NOT MY BIRTH NAME. UH, I THINK I'D JUST RATHER NOT SAY. I'LL JUST KEEP THAT ONE TO MYSELF. BUT, YEAH, THAT IS MY NAME. GOT IT. HOW DID YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE MONGOLS? SOME OF THEM HAD TOOK ME IN LIKE A FATHER FIGURE. I DON'T HAVE A FATHER, SO THAT'S WHAT IT CAME DOWN TO... WHEN THEY TOOK ME IN, LOVED ME, TREATED ME, YOU KNOW, HOW SOMEBODY SHOULD. SO WHEN IT CAME TO JOINING, IT WAS NOT ISSUE. I ALREADY KNEW. AND AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP WITHOUT A FATHER, WHAT DOES THIS BROTHERHOOD MEAN TO YOU? I CAN COUNT ON SOMEBODY OTHER THAN MYSELF NOW. YOU'RE HERE. YOU SEE US. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS? I MEAN, THIS IS... IT'S GREAT, RIGHT? YEAH, IT'S A GREAT FAMILY BARBECUE. YEAH, AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO EVERY SUNDAY AMONGST OUR OWN CHAPTERS. WE KNOW EACH OTHER'S KIDS, OUR FAMILIES. WHAT ELSE COULD YOU ASK FOR? THE POLICE AND EVERYONE ELSE WITH THE STUFF THEY'RE DISHING OUT FOR US, THAT DOESN'T DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM ANYTHING. THESE MEN SEEM LIKE FAMILY GUYS WHO JUST HAPPEN TO BE FOND OF HARLEYS AND TATTOOS, BUT I KNOW THERE'S MORE TO THE MONGOLS THAN FAMILY FUN DAY. IN 2008, NEWS BROKE THAT FEDERAL AGENTS HAD INFILTRATED THE MONGOLS AND ARRESTED MORE THAN 75 MEMBERS ON CHARGES RANGING FROM RACKETEERING TO DRUG AND WEAPONS TRAFFICKING TO MURDER. AMONG THE CONVICTED WAS THE CLUB'S NATIONAL PRESIDENT AT THE TIME, RUBEN "DOC" CAVAZOS, WHO LAW ENFORCEMENT ALLEGED WAS THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. HE'S SINCE BEEN EXCOMMUNICATED FROM THE CLUB, AND LIL DAVE HAS STEPPED INTO HIS ROLE. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS, HAVE THEY REALLY CLEANED UP THEIR ACT? HI, DAVE. HOW ARE YOU? I'M HOT. GOOD TO SEE YOU. AND IF SO, WHY DOES THE FBI STILL CLASSIFY THE MONGOLS AS A VIOLENT GANG? - OH. - HEY! HERE COME MORE GUYS. FOR MY FIRST GLIMPSE DEEPER INTO CLUB LIFE, I CATCH UP WITH LIL DAVE AND A FEW OF THE GUYS AT A LOCAL BIKE SHOP. HI. HOW ARE YOU? I'M LISA. TOMMY... TOMMY GUN. NICE TO MEET YOU. PLEASURE. WHAT'S UP, BRO? HOW OFTEN DO YOU ALL GET TOGETHER... YOUR CHAPTER? AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. IS THERE LIKE AN OBLIGATORY WEEKLY MEETING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? YEAH, I MEAN, EVERY NOW AND THEN, YEAH. GETTING THESE GUYS TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS ISN'T EASY. I MEAN, DOES THE TRUTH REALLY EVER COME OUT? I NOTICE A COUPLE OF THEM ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SHOOT-OUT IN WACO. OUT OF CURIOSITY, HAVE YOU BOTH BEEN IN PLACES WHERE THINGS LIKE THAT HAVE HAPPENED? LIKE, FIREFIGHTS OR MELEES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? NO. NO COMMENT? JUST WONDERING. I MEAN, CAN YOU... WHAT DO YOU DO IN THOSE SITUATIONS? DO YOU JUST... NO COMMENT? OKAY. STILL NO LUCK. WHAT'S UP WITH YOU, MAN? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL. I KNOW, LOOK AT THIS STICK. BUT THE NEXT DAY, I CATCH UP WITH DEAD MAN AND ONE OF HIS BROTHERS, SOLIDER, WHO ARE MORE WILLING TO OPEN UP. SO, SOLDIER, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO INTRODUCED DEAD MAN TO THE CLUB? YES, I DID. I ALWAYS SAID I WASN'T GONNA BRING NOBODY IN THE CLUB, BUT ME AND HIM GOT HISTORY TOGETHER. YOU ALWAYS SAID YOU WEREN'T GONNA BRING ANYONE IN? YEAH. WHY IS THAT? IT'S A BIG RESPONSIBILITY. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOU GOT TO VOUCH FOR SOMEBODY THAT MAY NOT MAKE A LIFETIME COMMITMENT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I TAKE THIS AS A LIFETIME. IT'S EITHER DEATH OR PRISON, YOU KNOW? I'M NOT GOING NOWHERE. THAT'S KIND OF SERIOUS... DEATH OR PRISON. THAT'S HOW I LIVE MY LIFE FOR THIS CLUB. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IF I COULD DIE FOR MY BROTHER TO LIVE OR GO TO PRISON FOR A BROTHER THAT CAN'T HANDLE GOING TO PRISON, I'LL DO IT. I'VE ALREADY BEEN THERE, DONE THAT. YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU'VE BEEN IN PRISON. CAN I ASK YOU WHAT FOR? WAS IT CLUB RELATED? NO, IT WASN'T CLUB RELATED. I WAS CULTIVATING A LITTLE BIT OF MARIJUANA. MUST HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT? A LITTLE IF YOU WENT TO PRISON. JUST A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? NOTHING MAJOR. SO, DO YOU THINK... WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SAME SIZE MARIJUANA OPERATION NOW UNDER DAVE? NO. DAVE DON'T PUT UP WITH THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? RIGHT NOW CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ISN'T EVEN A PART OF CLUB LIFE. WHY DO YOU THINK YOU'RE SO OFTEN REFERRED TO AS A GANG? WELL, THAT'S NOT ALWAYS BEEN KOSHER, YOU KNOW? IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING, LITTLE BUMPS IN THE ROADS HERE AND THERE. SO RIGHT AWAY, THEY HAVE TO LABEL US AS A GANG. ONE KIND OF SIMILARITY THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE WITH GANGS IS THERE ARE WARS OVER TERRITORY. LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, IF SOME HELLS ANGELS CAME INTO THIS BAR... ...WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? I'M JUST CURIOUS. MAYBE NOTHING MAY HAPPEN. MAYBE THEY MIGHT BUY ME A BEER. I DON'T KNOW. BUT I WOULDN'T TAKE IT. I'D PROBABLY SPIT BACK IN THERE AND GIVE IT BACK TO THEM. SAY, "HERE'S YOUR BEER. THANKS, BUT NO THANKS." WHICH WOULD PROBABLY START SOMETHING. HEY, IT MIGHT HAPPEN. BUT I DON'T... THEY WOULDN'T COME IN HERE, THOUGH. I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD. IT WOULD BE FOR THEIR BEST INTEREST. THERE'S CLEARLY SOME HOSTILITY BETWEEN THE MONGOLS AND THE HELLS ANGELS. WHAT I WANT TO FIGURE OUT IS WHAT STARTED IT AND HOW SERIOUS IT IS NOW. HEY, BROTHER, WHAT'S GOING ON? OKAY, COOL, YEAH, 'CAUSE WE GOT A BUSY NEXT TWO WEEKS TO GET EVERYTHING DONE BEFORE NATIONALS. IN TWO WEEKS, THE MONGOLS MOTORCYCLE CLUB WILL HOLD ONE OF THEIR NATIONAL RUNS... AN EVENT THEY'VE BEEN HAVING A FEW TIMES A YEAR SINCE 1969. THANKS, BRO. ALL RIGHT, LATER. HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WILL RIDE IN A PACK FROM LOS ANGELES TO PALM SPRINGS, THEN SPEND THE WEEKEND PARTYING AND TAKING CARE OF CLUB BUSINESS. THE NATIONAL PRESIDENT, LIL DAVE, IS KNEE-DEEP IN PREPARATIONS. JUST KIDDING. JUST A LITTLE BIKER HUMOR. SO, I'M GOING TO PICK UP SOME PATCHES FOR THE RUN. AND WE'LL BE PATCHING IN SOME BROTHERS THAT HAVE EARNED THE RIGHT TO BECOME FULL-FLEDGED BROTHERS IN OUR CLUB. AT THIS NATIONAL RUN, A FEW PROSPECTIVE MEMBERS WILL RECEIVE A PATCH THAT SIGNIFIES THEIR FULL ACCEPTANCE INTO THE MONGOLS. I ASKED DAVE FOR MORE DETAILS ON HOW THE PATCHES WORK. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PATCHES ON THE BACK OF VEST? IT'S THE MONGOLS TOP ROCKER, THE CENTER PATCH WITH THE GENGHIS KHAN RIDING A MOTORCYCLE, AND THE BOTTOM ROCKER THAT IDENTIFIES THE STATE THAT THE BROTHER'S FROM. AND DO YOU HAVE TO EARN THOSE? WELL, I MEAN, YOU EARN THEM IN STEPS. IT'S A THREE-STEP PROCESS. A PROSPECTIVE MEMBER FIRST EARNS THE BOTTOM ROCKER, THEN THE CENTER PATCH. AND WHEN HE FINALLY EARNS THE TOP ROCKER, HE BECOMES A FULL-FLEDGED MEMBER. SO, EVERYTHING'S IN HERE THAT I NEEDED? THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE PATCHES RUNS DEEP. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANING IS FOR YOU? FOR ME, IT'S TOTAL COMMITMENT TO THIS CLUB. I'D BE WILLING TO TAKE A BULLET FOR A BROTHER, AND A BROTHER WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE A BULLET FOR ME. SO, YOU GET INTO A JAM, A BROTHER'S THERE TO HELP YOU OUT. PEOPLE HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED FOR THE PATCHES. FOR SURE, RIGHT. YEAH, BACK IN THE DAY, I MEAN, WE WENT TO WAR WITH ANOTHER ORGANIZATION FOR THAT PURPOSE. DAVE'S TALKING ABOUT THE HELLS ANGELS. THE MONGOLS STARTED WEARING THE CALIFORNIA BOTTOM ROCKER. THAT'S CORRECT. AND THE OTHER CLUB WASN'T HAPPY WITH THAT. RIGHT, 'CAUSE THEY FELT THEY WERE HERE FIRST. IT WAS A BIG WAR. THEY WERE BLOWING EACH OTHER UP. THEY WOULD DISRESPECT US AND SHOOT US OR TRY TO BLOW SHIT UP AT FUNERAL HOMES WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO BURY OUR BROTHERS. THERE WAS LIKE NO RESPECT OR HONOR. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE WEREN'T GONNA LET NOBODY PUSH US OR BULLY US AROUND OR RUN US OUT OF TOWN. WE WERE HERE TO STAY, AND WE WEREN'T GONNA GO NOWHERE. IS IT OBLIGATORY WHEN YOU COME ACROSS BIKERS FROM A RIVAL CLUB TO BATTLE IT OUT? I WOULDN'T THINK SO. I MEAN, MAYBE BACK IN THE DAYS. BUT NOT ANYMORE. SO, YOU COULD KICK IT WITH A HELLS ANGEL? I WOULDN'T BREAK BREAD OR DRINK BEER WITH SOMEBODY FROM THAT ORGANIZATION. I HAVE ENOUGH BROTHERS TO DO THAT WITH. AND AT THIS POINT, OUR FIGHT IS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. THE MONGOLS ARE FACING A LANDMARK LEGAL BATTLE. FEDERAL PROSECUTORS ARE SEEKING FORFEITURE OF THE TRADEMARK ON THEIR PATCHES, ARGUING THAT THEY THE EMBLEMIZE A VIOLENT CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. DAVE INVITES ME TO A HEARING. I SEE THAT HE'S TRADED IN HIS LEATHERS FOR A SUIT. MORNING. MORNING. DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE YOU. OH, IS THIS YOUR ATTORNEY HERE? HI. HOW ARE YOU? LISA. JOE YANNY. LISA. VERY NICE TO MEET YOU. GLAD TO MEET YOU. HEY, JOE. HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY? PRETTY GOOD. HEY, GUYS. SO, WHAT COULD HAPPEN TODAY? THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE I GUESS. YOU KNOW, IT'S A CHANCE TO MAYBE GET THIS THING THROWN OUT, PUT AN END TO THIS PERSECUTION. YOU KNOW, THERE WERE ROUGHLY 80 MEN ACCUSED BACK IN '08. AND THEY HAVE EITHER SERVED THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY OR THEY'RE CURRENTLY DOING IT. WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO NOW IS GO AFTER THE OTHER 700 MEN THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THOSE MEN DID. SO, THIS IS POTENTIALLY A VERY BIG DAY. VERY... HUGE DAY FOR US. BEEN UNDER INDICTMENT FOR LIKE THE LAST SEVEN YEARS NOW. YOU KNOW, YOU'D THINK ENOUGH'S ENOUGH. LADIES FIRST. THE JUDGE DOESN'T ALLOW OUR CAMERAS INSIDE, BUT I SPEND A FEW HOURS IN THE HEARING. THE CASE DOES NOT GET DISMISSED. AND I'M A LITTLE SHOCKED BY SOME OF THE THINGS I HEAR. I MEAN, WHEN I WAS SITTING IN THAT COURTROOM AND THE JUDGE WAS READING OFF THE DIFFERENT ACTS OF THE INDICTMENT... RIGHT... HE MENTIONED MURDER... SURE... AND DRUG TRAFFICKING... RIGHT. ...AND ROBBERY AND MONEY LAUNDERING. RIGHT. YOU'VE BEEN IN THE CLUB FOR A LONG TIME. RIGHT. YOU HAD TO KNOW THAT SOME OF THAT STUFF WAS GOING ON. THE DRUG TRAFFICKING, I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK ON. THOSE WERE INDIVIDUAL ACTS. IT'S NOT AS A WHOLE, AS A CLUB. BUT AS FAR AS LIKE THE MURDERS OR THE ATTEMPTED MURDERS, THEY WERE SELF-DEFENSE. WHAT I TELL MY BROTHERS IS, AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND YOURSELF BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE. BUT JUST SOMEBODY SAYING SOMETHING OR GETTING IN YOUR FACE, AIN'T ENOUGH TO JUMP. IF SOMEBODY GETS SHOT OR STABBED RIGHT FROM THE GATE, OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA DEFEND YOURSELF. YOU'RE NOT GONNA SIT THERE AND LET YOURSELF GET MURDERED OR KILLED. IN COURT, PROSECUTORS REFERENCED A DEADLY CLASH BETWEEN THE HELLS ANGELS AND THE MONGOLS THAT TOOK PLACE IN 2002. SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS RECORDED THE INCIDENT AT A CASINO IN LAUGHLIN, NEVADA. THEY CAME TO US. WE DIDN'T COME TO THEM. THEY DREW THE FIRST BLOOD. UNFORTUNATELY, TWO OF THEIR GUYS DIED AND ONE OF OUR GUYS DIED ON THE FLOOR OF THAT CASINO. IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT, LIKE MANY. YOU KNOW? BUT THAT WAS A CLUB ACT OUT OF SELF-DEFENSE. WE WERE MINDING OUR OWN BUSINESS. THE GOVERNMENT ALSO ALLEGED THAT IN ADDITION TO THE MAIN PATCHES ON THE BACKS OF THEIR VEST, MONGOLS CAN EARN PATCHES FOR OTHER THINGS. I SAW THAT THERE IS A PATCH... SKULL AND CROSSBONES... MM-HMM. ...FOR TAKING OUT A TARGET. IS THAT TRUE? I MEAN, HERE'S THE THING... 'CAUSE IT'S ONLINE, SO YOU CAN... I MEAN, TELL ME AS MUCH... IT'S PUBLIC RECORD. I HAVEN'T SEEN IT ONLINE. I MEAN, THAT'S NEWS TO ME. I CAN PULL IT UP RIGHT NOW. UM... YOU KNOW, IN A SELF-DEFENSE SITUATION, MAYBE A BROTHER WAS AWARDED THAT. BUT I CAN'T GET INTO A WHOLE LOT REGARDING THE PATCHES. IT'S JUST... BUT IT IS IN THE INDICTMENT AND... IT IS PUBLIC RECORD. IT IS IN THE INDICTMENT. BUT ON THE PATCH SITUATION, I JUST WANT TO KEEP FULL ANONYMITY ON THAT. OKAY. PART OF THE REASON WHY PEOPLE I THINK ARE SUSPICIOUS OF MOTORCYCLE CLUBS IS 'CAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SECRECY INVOLVED. THERE IS SECRECY, BUT IT'S NOT AS SINISTER AND EVIL AS PEOPLE WOULD PERCEIVE IT TO BE. AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I'VE OPEN UP MY HOME AND MY CLUB TO TALK TO THE MEDIA... FOR THAT REASON. DAVE MAY NOT BE WILLING TO TELL ME EVERYTHING, BUT HE'S ALREADY OPENED THE DOOR FURTHER FOR ME THAN FOR ANYONE ELSE. IN FACT, HE AGREES TO DEEPEN MY ACCESS BY ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK WITH A PROSPECTIVE MEMBER. I'VE HEARD THAT GETTING INTO THE CLUB CAN TAKE MONTHS, EVEN YEARS, OF HARD WORK. BUT THE PROCESS HAS REMAINED LARGELY HIDDEN FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD UNTIL NOW. TODAY, THE MONGOLS HAVE ARRANGED FOR ME TO MEET A PROSPECT... SOMEONE WHO'S TRYING TO EARN THE CLUB'S COVETED PATCH. HI. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. I'M LISA. NICE TO MEET YOU. I'M JUNIOR. YOU'RE JUNIOR? YES. NICE TO MEET YOU. IS YOUR DAD HERE? YES. HI, HOW ARE YOU? HI. YOURSELF? I'M WELL. MIKE IS A FORMER MARINE WHO HUNG AROUND THE CLUB FOR SEVEN YEARS BEFORE THEY INVITED HIM TO BE A PROSPECT. SO, YOU'RE A PROSPECT, AND YOU HAVE THREE KIDS? CORRECT. NOW HE'S TRYING TO PROVE HIS COMMITMENT TO THE CLUB WHILE WORKING FULL TIME AS A CARPENTER AND TAKING CARE OF HIS KIDS. YOU MIND IF I JUST CHECK IN REAL QUICK? WHO DO YOU HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH? WITH MY SARGE. GO AHEAD. SO, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S OBLIGATORY? CORRECT. PATCH-HOLDER. CHECKING IN. ALL RIGHT 10-4. All right? OKAY. SO, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO PICK UP LUGGAGE? IT'S WHATEVER THEY NEED. WHATEVER THE PATCH-HOLDERS NEED. ARE YOU ON CALL 24/7? PRETTY MUCH. IT JUST SHOWS YOUR DEDICATION TO THE CLUB. IS THAT HARD WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE HERE TO JUST HAVE TO LEAVE? NO, IT'S NOT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I WANT, AND THIS IS WHAT I'LL PUT FIRST. I KNOW THAT WHAT I GOT TO DO, SO IT'S MY MENTALITY. AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A PROSPECT? 189 DAYS... 6 MONTHS. AND HOW LONG COULD YOU BE A PROSPECT? AS LONG AS THEY WANT YOU TO BE. SO, WHEN YOU GOT THAT CALL FROM LEADERSHIP SAYING IT WAS OKAY TO TALK TO US... CORRECT. ...HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? UH, HONESTLY, I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO DO IT. I'M A PROSPECT, AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING WRONG OR TO OFFEND ANYBODY FROM THE CLUB BECAUSE THIS IS EVERYTHING TO ME, THIS IS MY FAMILY. WHERE DID THAT PASSION FOR THE CLUB COME FROM? JUST HOW THEY TREAT ME, HOW THEY EMBRACE YOU. EVERY ONE OF THEM MAKES YOU FEEL LOVED. AT THE RUN TO PALM SPRINGS... CORRECT. ...I KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE PATCHING IN SOME PEOPLE. DO YOU KNOW IF YOU'LL BE ONE OF THOSE MEN? NO, I DO NOT. I'LL BE PATCHED IN WHEN THEY FEEL I'M READY. BUT I DON'T ASK. IF AND WHEN YOU DO BECOME A FULL-PATCH MEMBER, HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'LL FEEL TO BE WEARING THAT MONGOL PATCH? ON TOP OF THE WORLD. ON TOP OF THE WORLD. SEEING HOW MUCH MIKE IS WILLING TO SACRIFICE TO BECOME A MEMBER IS HELPING ME UNDERSTAND WHY FULL-PATCH MONGOLS ARE SO DEDICATED. DREW IS PRESIDENT OF THE SANTA FE SPRINGS CHAPTER AND OWNER OF NO REGRETS TATTOO SHOP. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR MEMBERS OF BIKER CLUBS TO HAVE TATTOOS IDENTIFYING THEM WITH THEIR CLUBS? FOR ME, IT'S PRIDE AND LOVE I HAVE FOR MY NATION, FOR THE CLUB. ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT MIGHT CALL YOU A GANG BECAUSE YOU KIND OF LOOK THE PART? UH, YEAH. I CAN SEE WHY EVEN OTHER BIKE CLUBS WOULD CALL US, YOU KNOW, CHOLOS ON WHEELS, GANGSTER BIKERS. AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE DIFFERENT BETWEEN YOU ALL AND A GANG IS? YOU HAVE TO BE A BREAD WINNER TO BE IN THIS CLUB. THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS WE ASK IS, "DO YOU HAVE A JOB?" YOU KNOW? I HAVE MY BUSINESS RIGHT HERE. HIS FAMILY, THEY OWN A STREET SWEEPING AND A GRAFFITI REMOVAL COMPANY. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T JUST BE A DEADBEAT AND JOIN THIS CLUB. IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN. WHAT'S UP, DAVE? WHAT'S UP, DREW? HEY, DAVE. HOW YOU DOING? GOOD. JUST WATCHING SOMETHING THAT LOOKS PAINFUL. YEAH. SO, WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT FACE THAT YOU'RE TATTOOING? IT'S PRETTY MUCH OUR CENTER PATCH, OUR DEPICTION OF GENGHIS KHAN. CAN ANYBODY WHO'S A MONGOL GET A MONGOL HEAD TATTOOED ON THEIR BODY? NO, IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. THERE'S A CHAIN OF COMMAND YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH. SO WHAT IF I DID? YOU GOT TO ASK LIL DAVE. YOU HAVE TO CUT IT OFF ME? CUT IT OFF YOU. WHAT WOULD YOU DO... SERIOUSLY... IF SOMEONE... WE'D ASK YOU TO EITHER REMOVE IT OR COVER IT UP. YEAH. NICELY. YEAH. WHAT IF I REFUSED? NICELY. THAT'S AS NICE AS IT GETS RIGHT THERE. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW YOU EARN THEM? NO. THAT'S A TOUCHY ONE RIGHT THERE. SO, CAN AT LEAST TELL ME WHO OKAYED YOUR TATTOO, SWEEPER? HE'S DOING IT. SO, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A ONE-PERCENTER? YOU KNOW, BEING A BIKER. THE BAD SEED, THE BAD PART OF THE BIKER WORLD. YOU KNOW, WE DON'T TAKE SHIT FROM NOBODY. YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY'S GONNA COME AND THEY'RE GONNA STEP ON OUR FEET AND NOT APOLOGIZE, THEN THEY'RE GONNA GET OFF. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT'S THAT SIMPLE. IT'S LIKE WE DEMAND RESPECT. RESPECT IS A BIG THING IN THE WHOLE BIKER WORLD. THE MORE TIME I SPEND WITH THESE GUYS, THE MORE I'M SEEING HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS BROTHERHOOD IS IN EACH OF THEIR LIVES. THERE'S SOMETHING PRIMAL AND TRIBAL ABOUT IT. THESE GUYS ARE WILLING TO DIE AND KILL FOR EACH OTHER, AND THERE AREN'T THAT MANY OTHER OUTLETS THAT ALLOW MEN TO FEEL THAT KIND OF ALPHA WAY. AND I GET IT. I'M NOT A MAN, BUT I GET IT. I DOESN'T GET MORE ALPHA THAN HUNDREDS OF MEN WHO CALL THEMSELVES BROTHERS RIDING ON THE OPEN ROAD. AND I'M GOING TO EXPERIENCE IT FOR MYSELF. DAVE HAS INVITED ME TO JOIN THE MONGOLS ON THEIR NATIONAL RUN TO PALM SPRINGS. BEFORE YOU LEAVE, I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING. ARE YOU GOOD WITH THAT? YEAH. COOL. COME ON. SO, I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GO ON A RIDE WITH US REAL SOON HERE, AND I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU YOUR FIRST HELMET. A JOCKEY HELMET, NOVELTY HELMET, STILL WITH THE TAGS. IT'S NOT USED. NOBODY ELSE HAS USED THIS. THANK YOU FOR THAT. SO, THIS IS YOUR HELMET. SHOULD I BE NERVOUS? NOT AT ALL... YOU'RE WITH US. AIN'T NOTHING TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE WELCOME. AS SOON AS I PULL OUT, I PASS A MONGOL WHO'S BEEN PULLED OVER ON HIS BIKE BY A COP. THE GUYS HAVE TOLD ME LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THEM UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE, READY TO BUST THEM FOR THE SLIGHTEST INFRACTION. IF THIS ANY INDICATION OF WHAT IT'LL BE LIKE ON THE RUN, MAYBE I SHOULD BE A LITTLE NERVOUS. ESPINOZA'S. IT'S THE DAY BEFORE THE MONGOL'S NATIONAL RUN TO PALM SPRINGS, AND ESPINOZA'S LEATHER SHOP IS THE PLACE TO BE. WHAT'S UP BROTHER? WHAT'S UP BROTHER? WHO ARE YOU? GOOD. INDIE, THE WAR VET WE MET AT FAMILY FUN DAY, IS ONE OF THE MANY CLUB MEMBERS HERE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO HIS VEST. ALL RIGHT. PUT THE "EAST L.A." ON THE INSIDE. OKAY. AND THEN TAKE THE BANDANA OUT. OKAY. SANTOS, WHAT'S UP BRO? DAVE IS HERE TO GET HIS WIFE, ANNIE'S, PATCH SEWN ON TO HER NEW VEST BEFORE SHE JOINS HIM ON THE RUN. YOU'RE GONNA FIT IT JUST LIKE THIS. THIS IS GONNA BE PERFECT. I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STATUS OF BIKERS' WIVES AND GIRLFRIENDS. NOT ONLY DO WOMEN WHERE PATCHES DECLARING THEM PROPERTY, I'VE ALSO READ THAT MEN ARE AWARDED WINGS FOR PERFORMING CERTAIN SEXUAL ACTS. THERE ARE A LOT OF RULES EVEN FOR WOMEN WHO COME AROUND THE CLUB. THERE'S UNWRITTEN RULES. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO ACT RIGHT AS A WOMAN, NUMBER ONE. IT'S NOT A DISRESPECT, TRUST ME. FOR ALL YOU WOMEN OUT THERE. I SOME OF YOU ARE FEMINISTS. I'M BEING CALM ABOUT IT. IT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT TO GET IT ACROSS THAT THIS IS THE MONGOLS MOTORCYCLE CLUB. IT'S NOT OUR OLD LADIES' CLUB. HOWEVER THEY HANDLE HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CLUB, DAVE AND ANNIE ARE CLEARLY DOING SOMETHING RIGHT. THEY'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR 21 YEARS, HAVE 5 KIDS, AND THREE GRAND KIDS, AND CO-OWN A LUCRATIVE BAIL BONDS BUSINESS. HOW DIFFERENT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR WIFE OUTSIDE OF THE CLUB? WHEN IT'S JUST ME AND HER, I'M JUST DAVID. I DON'T HAVE TO BE LITTLE DAVE, THE PRESIDENT. AND I'M GOOD WITH THAT. I'M SURE THE LIFESTYLE HAS PROBABLY BROKEN UP A LOT OF RELATIONSHIPS. UNFORTUNATELY, IT HAS. I HAD A BROTHER RECENTLY THAT BROKE UP WITH HIS WIFE AFTER 35 YEARS. AND SHE BASICALLY GAVE HIM AN ULTIMATUM... "IT'S THE CLUB OR ME." HE CHOSE THE CLUB. STILL PLENTY OF WOMEN CHOOSE TO BE WITH BIKERS. AND I'M CURIOUS TO GET THEIR PERSPECTIVE. IF YOU THINK GETTING THE MONGOLS TO AGREE TO BE ON CAMERA WAS DIFFICULT, GETTING THE WIVES OF MONGOLS HAS BEEN EVEN HARDER. BUT A SMALL GROUP OF THEM HAVE AGREED TO COME AND MEET ME AT THIS RESTAURANT, INCLUDING LIL DAVE'S WIFE. I DON'T KNOW HOW FORTHCOMING THEY'RE GOING TO BE, BUT THEY'RE HERE. WELL, THANKS FOR COMING, LADIES. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US. HOW ARE Y'ALL DOING? FANTASTIC. ARE YOU ALL PREPARED FOR TOMORROW, FOR THE BIG NATIONAL RUN? WE'VE BEEN. SO, WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE MARRIED TO MONGOLS? EXCITING. IT'S EXCITING. AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO DO ALMOST EVERY WEEKEND. CHICKEN. THESE WOMEN ARE ALL WORKING PROFESSIONALS. AND YET NONE OF THEM SEEM TO MIND BEING LABELED AS SOMEONE'S PROPERTY. SO, WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WEAR THINGS THAT SAY "PROPERTY OF"? I FEEL POWERFUL IN A SENSE. I LOVE IT. IT'S JUST ANOTHER SYMBOL OF RESPECT FOR OURSELVES AND FOR OUR MEN. BUT DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL OWNED? OWNED? NO. NO. NO. I'M PROUD OF MY PROPERTIES. IT'S LIKE HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU PUT YOUR WEDDING RING ON? PROUD. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE CLUB, ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE SUBMISSIVE? SUBMISSIVE. THAT WORD... IT'S LIKE IT SETS US BACK LIKE IN THE 1950s. AND IT'S LIKE SAYING THE DOG IS SUBMISSIVE. I MEAN, WE RESPECT OUR HUSBANDS, AND WE RESPECT THE CLUB. AND I THINK OUR ROLE IS A CHOICE. YEAH. BUT AS A WIFE, DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE CLUB COMES BEFORE YOU? I REALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THAT. YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE THAT DAVID WOULD TRY TO PROTECT US ALL EQUALLY. I DON'T FEEL LIKE MY HUSBAND PUTS ME ON THE BACK BURNER OR THAT I'M LESS THAN. I'VE BEEN THE POSITION WHERE I FELT LIKE THE CLUB DIDCOME FIRST. AND, "WHERE ARE YOU GOING?" "DON'T ASK ME." "OKAY." BUT WITH TIME, IT EVOLVED, AND NOW IT'S LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, GET YOUR BAGS READY, BABE. WE'RE GOING HERE." YOU KNOW? AND WHEN YOU'RE AT CLUB FUNCTIONS, DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN JUST SPEAK OPENLY AND FREELY? YOU KNOW, I'M WITH MY MAN, I'M JUST QUIET. AND I NEVER WENT UP TO OTHER GUYS BECAUSE A LOT OF IT'S COMMON SENSE. YOU JUST DON'T DO IT. IT'S JUST DISRESPECTFUL. YOU DON'T ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS. IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. IT'S NONE OF OUR BUSINESS. I'D BE A TERRIBLE OLD LADY, THOUGH. WHY? BECAUSE I JUST NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING. CURIOSITY. YEAH. SO, HERE'S A QUESTION. ARE YOU EVER CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR SAFETY WHEN YOU'RE PART OF CLUB THINGS? I FEEL THE SAFEST. NAH, MY MAN'S A HARD ASS. I LOVE HIM FOR THAT. YEAH, I LOVE IT, TOO. I LOVE IT. THEY ARE KIND OF THE ULTIMATE BAD BOYS. THE NEXT MORNING, THOSE BAD BOYS ARE GATHERING IN A PACK OF HUNDREDS FOR THEIR NATIONAL RUN. TODAY'S THE DAY OF THE NATIONAL RUN. HUNDREDS OF MONGOLS WILL RIDE AS A PACK TO PALM SPRINGS. MEDIA HAS NEVER BEEN ALLOWED TO DO THIS, AND I AM, UM, EXCITED BUT A LITTLE NERVOUS. SO, LIL DAVE, WHO AM I RIDING WITH? YOU'RE GONNA BE RIDING WITH MY V.P., SANTOS. HEY, SANTOS. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. BEFORE THE RIDE BEGINS, DAVE ASSEMBLES THE GUYS TO SAY A FEW WORDS. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE BROTHERS FOR COMING OUT TODAY. WE GOT THEM OTHER DUMMIES, THE OTHER TEAM, ON THE ROAD, TOO, THIS WEEKEND. SO, KEEP YOU HEAD ON A SWIVEL. I THINK DAVE IS USING CODED LANGUAGE. I THINK "THEM OTHER DUMMIES" AND "THE OTHER TEAM" ARE THE HELLS ANGELS. IF SOMEBODY BREAKS DOWN, I WANT FIVE BROTHERS WITH THAT BROTHER. DON'T LEAVE HIM BY HIMSELF ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. NOBODY STAY BY THEMSELVES. THIS WHOLE WEEKEND, IT'S GONNA BE HOT. HUH! AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON DAVE IS ASKING THESE GUYS TO BE ON THEIR BEST BEHAVIOR. AFTER THE INCIDENT IN WACO, POLICE EVERYWHERE ARE ON HIGH ALERT. BE COURTEOUS, RESPECTFUL, AND DON'T UP. I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU AGAIN. NOW, LISA LING, SHE'S RIGHT HERE. PRETTY LISA LING. SHE'S NOT TRYING TO BE NOBODY'S GIRLFRIEND. SHE'S NOT TRYING TO BE NOBODY'S GIRLFRIEND FOR THE WEEKEND, SO BE RESPECTFUL AND NICE. THAT'S THAT. HUH! POLICE, HELLS ANGELS, HUNDREDS OF MEN LOOKING FOR A GIRLFRIEND. SURE, I CAN HANDLE THIS. I'VE EXPERIENCED A LOT OF THINGS IN MY LIFE, BUT I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS. I'M AT THE HEAD OF A PACK OF HUNDREDS OF BIKERS WHO'VE TAKEN OVER A CALIFORNIA FREEWAY. THE PRESIDENT OF THE MONGOLS, LIL DAVE, AND HIS WIFE, ANNIE, ARE AT MY SIDE. I CAN'T STOP LOOKING BEHIND ME TO SEE THIS ENDLESS FORMATION OF BIKES. EVERY MONGOL I'VE TALKED TO HAS SAID THERE'S NOT FEELING LIKE THIS. AND I GET IT NOW. I GET THE RUSH OF BEING PART OF THIS MASSIVE GROUP OWNING THE OPEN ROAD. THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. THIS IS WHAT THESE GUYS LIVE FOR. I'M RELIEVED THAT WE HAVEN'T RUN INTO ANY RIVAL MOTORCYCLE CLUBS. BUT POLICE ARE EVERYWHERE. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, THEY PULL SOMEONE OVER. IT SEEMS TO BE TOTALLY RANDOM. THEY CHECK THE GUY'S LICENSE AND SEND HIM ON HIS WAY. THE POLICE PRESENCE IS DEFINITELY INVASIVE, BUT IN SOME WAYS, IT'S PART OF THE THRILL. WE STOP FOR GAS, AND I HAVE A CHANCE TO CATCH MY BREATH. OH, MY GOD. MY HEART IS IN MY STOMACH. I WAS SO NERVOUS. I'M STILL SO TENSE. AND IT SEEMED LIKE WE OWNED THE FREEWAYS BECAUSE I THINK CARS ARE AFRAID TO COME UP. IT'S INTENSE. IT IS. I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS. AFTER TWO HOURS ON THE ROAD, WE REACH OUR DESTINATION... PALM SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA. THE MONGOLS HAVE BOOKED AN ENTIRE HOTEL FOR THE WEEKEND, AND WE'VE BEEN INVITED TO JOIN THEM. HUNDREDS OF OUTLAW BIKERS FLOOD ON TO THE PROPERTY. AND I'M CURIOUS HOW THE HOTEL STAFF IS HANDLING IT. WHAT ARE THEY LIKE AS CUSTOMERS? THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED THAT THEY ARE VIOLENT, THEY ARE RUTHLESS. THAT'S NOT THE CASE, THAT WHAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED. THEY ARE SO KIND AND ABSOLUTELY THE MOST WELL-BEHAVED GROUP THAT WE EVER GET. ARE YOU TRYING TO BE A MONGOL, AFTAB? AS YOU CAN SEE, THE POOL AREA IS PRETTY QUIET AND SEDATE, AND THAT'S BECAUSE ALL OF THE FULL-PATCH MEMBERS ARE IN AN OBLIGATORY MEETING THAT WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ATTEND. SO, WHILE WE MAY HAVE UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS, WE DO NOT HAVE TOTAL ACCESS. BUT WHEN THE MEETING LETS OUT, THE PARTY RAMPS UP. THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE. 90! THERE ARE MANY MOMENTS WHEN I FORGET THAT THIS CLUB IS UNDER INDICTMENT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO FAR, YEAH, YEAH. OH, OKAY, OKAY. OH, DID YOU? THANK YOU. BUT THERE'S ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO AREN'T JOINING IN ON THE FUN. PROSPECTS ARE WORKING GRUELING 12-HOUR SHIFTS RUNNING SECURITY, CLEANING THE GROUNDS, AND WAITING ON FULL-PATCH MEMBERS. THEY DO THIS BECAUSE THEY DESPERATELY WANT TO BECOME MONGOLS. WHEN EVENING TURNS TO NIGHT, THE MONGOLS CONGREGATE. AND I CAN TELL SOMETHING BIG IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP. HEY, WE'RE GONNA PATCH IN A BROTHER RIGHT HERE. WE'RE AT THE MONGOLS' NATIONAL RUN, AND THIS IS THE MOMENT EVERY PROSPECT WAITS FOR... THE MOMENT HE GETS HIS FINAL PATCH AND BECOMES A MONGOL. IT'S A SERIOUS AND SACRED RITUAL THAT NO ONE FROM THE MEDIA HAS EVER BEEN ALLOWED TO DOCUMENT. IT'S HERE THAT I SEE MIKE, THE PROSPECT I MET AT HIS HOME A COUPLE DAYS AGO. HE'S FINALLY GETTING PATCHED IN. SO, DESCRIBE THE FEELING RIGHT NOW. JUST OVERWHELMING. EXCITEMENT, JOY. THIS IS ONE BIG FAMILY. AND THE TIME YOU PUT IN WAS ALL FOR YOUR BROTHERS. OUR TIME WITH THE MONGOLS IS COMING TO A CLOSE, AND I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST BEGINNING TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE. I CAN ONLY DRAW CONCLUSIONS FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN ALLOWED TO SEE. THIS BROTHERHOOD IS LIKE A FRATERNITY... A UNIQUE KIND OF FAMILY FOR ITS MEMBERS. THERE'S NO DOUBT THEY HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS NO MATTER WHAT. AND AS FOR THE REST... LET'S BE CLEAR, THERE ARE MONGOLS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES. THERE MAY BE MONGOLS WHO ARE STILL COMMITTING CRIMES. AND THEY MAY ENGAGE IN SOME SECRETIVE RITUALS THAT COULD BE PERCEIVED BY THE PUBLIC AS BEING UNSAVORY. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT AS AN ORGANIZATION THEY ARE CRIMINALS. THE ONLY THING I WOULDN'T DO IS WITH THEM BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE PROBLEMS. WHO THE ARE WE?! WE ARE MONGOL RIDERS! THE BADDEST OF THE BAD! - WE'RE BAD SONS OF BITCHES! - YOU BETTER FIGHT! WHO THE ARE WE?! MONGOLS MC!
