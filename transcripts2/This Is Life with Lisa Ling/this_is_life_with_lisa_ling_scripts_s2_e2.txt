 A V.I.P. IS BEING FLOWN IN BY HELICOPTER. NOT A MOVIE STAR OR A POLITICIAN BUT SOMEONE WITH A WORLDWIDE FOLLOWING. NICOLE MOUDABER IS AN EDM DEEJAY, AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT EDM MEANS, JUST ASK ANYONE UNDER 30. GO MAKE SOME NOISE FOR GRAMATIK, PEOPLE! YOUNGER GENERATIONS JUST IDENTIFY MORE WITH TECHNOLOGY-BASED MUSIC, MUSIC THAT SOUNDS LIKE ROBOTS MADE IT. ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC ISN'T JUST A NEW POP GENRE.

 IT'S A CULTURE, ONE THAT OFFERS A PLACE FOR LONELY TRAVELERS AND A CARNIVAL FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO PARTY. THE ATMOSPHERE, THE PEOPLE, THE FRIENDS... I LOVE IT. BUT THE MUSIC IS WHAT MAKES IT HAPPEN. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO EDM, AND IT'S A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS ONE. IT HAS TO DO WITH A PARTY DRUG CALLED MOLLY. THERE IT IS RIGHT HERE. IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE, YOU BETTER KNOW THE RISKS, BECAUSE IT COULD KILL YOU. AND FOR THOSE WHO TRAVEL IN EDM'S DRUG WORLD, SMUGGLING CONTRABAND INTO FESTIVAL SITES IS A TOUGH GAME WITH HIGH STAKES. IS IT WORTH THE RISK? ABSOLUTELY.

 I HAVE BEEN WILLING TO RISK GOING TO PRISON FROM THE BEGINNING. MYSTERYLAND, WHERE THE YOU AT?! IN THE '90s, WE CALLED THESE RAVES. AND I WAS A PART OF THE SCENE. NOW I WANT TO FIND OUT JUST HOW MUCH IT'S CHANGED. THIS IS LIFE WITH LISA LING - SEASON 2 EP 2 - Electronic Woodstock EDM EVENTS ARE NOW A GLOBAL PHENOMENON. BUT THE MOVEMENT ISN'T NEW. IN THE '90s, THEY WERE CALLED RAVES, ALL-NIGHT DANCE PARTIES THAT TOOK PLACE IN WAREHOUSES. WHILE MY DAY JOB PUT ME IN THE SPOTLIGHT... AND CHANNEL 1 NEWS ON TAPE. ...MY SECRET RELEASE WAS THIS UNDERGROUND SCENE. BACK THEN, RAVERS ENHANCED THEIR EXPERIENCE BY TAKING A SYNTHETIC DRUG CALLED MDMA, ALSO KNOWN AS ECSTASY. AND LET'S JUST SAY, I WAS NO STRANGER TO THAT, EITHER. THEN THE GOVERNMENT CRACKED DOWN, AND THE SCENE DRIED UP. MANY ASSUMED IT WAS DEAD. BUT IN THE LAST DECADE, EDM BOUNCED BACK... ...IN A BIG WAY. AND TODAY, IT'S HUGE AND TOTALLY MAINSTREAM. I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS SCENE AND WHY IT'S RESONATING WITH MILLENNIALS. SO, I'M HEADED TO UPSTATE NEW YORK TO ATTEND AN EDM FESTIVAL CALLED MYSTERYLAND. HERE AT THE CONCERT SITE, 50,000 YOUNG PEOPLE WILL ASSEMBLE ON THE GROUNDS OF THE ORIGINAL WOODSTOCK FESTIVAL. MY FIRST STOP... A MOTEL NOT FAR FROM THE CONCERT. EVERYONE SAYS THAT THE DANCE-MUSIC COMMUNITY IS REALLY WELCOMING, SO A LOT OF PEOPLE COME ALONE TO THESE EVENTS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE GONNA FIND ACCEPTANCE HERE, AND RIGHT NOW, WE'RE WAITING FOR A WOMAN WHO'S DRIVING IN FROM MASSACHUSETTS AND STAYING OVERNIGHT IN THIS INN. HEY. ARE YOU VERA? HI. YEAH! HEY, VERA... LISA. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. YOU HAVE SO MUCH STUFF IN HERE. YES, I AM PRETTY MUCH LIVING OUT OF MY CAR. WHY? WELL, IT'S A LONG STORY. I WAS WITH SOMEBODY. WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MOVE TO JACKSONVILLE TOGETHER, AND HE BROKE UP WITH ME. IT'LL BE FIVE WEEKS ON SATURDAY. AND MY LIFE KIND OF TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. SO ALL OF MY STUFF'S IN MY CAR, AND AFTER MYSTERYLAND, I'LL ACTUALLY BE MOVING TO COLORADO. LIKE MANY YOUNG AMERICANS, VERA IS BURDENED BY DEBT, OFTEN WORKING TWO JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET. ADDING TO HER WOES, AN EX-BOYFRIEND WHO PLANS ON ATTENDING MYSTERYLAND. HE MATCHED MY VIBE, AND NOBODY ELSE HAS, AND I'VE MET SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY LIFE, AND THERE IS NOBODY LIKE HIM. SO... YEAH, I'M NERVOUS. I'M NERVOUS, BUT IF THE UNIVERSE WANTS US TO BE TOGETHER, WE'LL BE TOGETHER. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO ONE OF THESE THINGS ALONE? I'VE NEVER BEEN TO ONE, PERIOD. AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE BEEN ALONE DOING ANYTHING IN MY LIFE, SO THIS IS A HUGE DEAL FOR ME. I DON'T WANT TO BE A CAGED BIRD ANYMORE. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO HAVE THE TIME OF MY LIFE AND NOBODY JUDGING ME. SO I'M JUST GONNA GO WITH THE FLOW. IT'S FRIDAY MORNING, THE DAY BEFORE THE MYSTERYLAND CONCERT BEGINS. AT A LOCAL WALMART, FESTIVAL-GOERS STOCK UP FOR THE WEEKEND. CHRIS AND GIL ARE ARMY VETS TRAVELING WITH THEIR WIVES, FRIENDS, AND FELLOW SOLDIERS WHO HAVE RETURNED FROM WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY'RE HERE FOR THREE DAYS OF EDM R&R.; - GOT DENVER IN THE HOUSE. - RIGHT. GOT NEW YORK CITY IN THE HOUSE, L.A. IN THE HOUSE. CHICAGO IS SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE. L.A. RIGHT HERE. OH, L.A. RIGHT THERE? CALIFORNIA LOVE. CALIFORNIA LOVE. OH, YOU, TOO? WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS FESTIVAL? IT'S A BREAK FROM LIFE. IT'S A BREAK FROM BEING AN ADULT. WE ALL HAVE SERIOUS JOBS. YOU KNOW, WE WERE IN THE ARMY. HE WAS IN THE ARMY. I MEAN, LIFE'S SERIOUS, AND SOMETIMES IT'S TOO MUCH THAT YOU NEED A BREAK, YOU KNOW? WHERE WERE YOU DEPLOYED? AFGHANISTAN. FOR HOW LONG? 11 MONTHS AND 18 DAYS. DID YOU SEE SOME OH, YEAH, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF HE GOES TO COUNSELING. LET'S JUST PUT IT THAT WAY. EVERY FRIDAY, I GOT TO. THIS IS YOUR FIRST... FIRST TIME. ...FIRST FESTIVAL. YES. WHY DID YOU WANT TO COME? 'CAUSE I KIND OF NEED THAT AIR BALLOON TO GO UP RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE I GOT SO MUCH WEIGHT RIGHT HERE, YOU KNOW? ANYONE WHO'S IN THE MILITARY NOW CAN ATTEST TO THE SAME THING. WE'RE TYPE-A PERSONALITIES, AND WE ALL GOT TO BE THE BIG DOG ON THE BLOCK, AND BEING ABLE TO KIND OF LET GO OF THAT PERSONA FOR A WHILE AND NOT HAVE TO BE, YOU KNOW, THE ONE THAT EVERYONE COUNTS ON, IT'S JUST... IT FEELS GOOD. CHRIS AND GIL AND THEIR CREW ARE PART OF A FIRST WAVE OF FESTIVAL-GOERS GIVEN ACCESS TO THE CAMPGROUNDS A DAY IN ADVANCE. BUT ENTRY COMES WITH CONDITIONS. MYSTERYLAND'S PROMOTERS HAVE A NO-DRUG POLICY, AND THEY ENFORCE IT. DO YOU HAVE ANY WEAPONS, TOOLS? GLASS CONTAINERS? NO GLASS. EVERY CONCERT-GOER MUST PASS THROUGH A GAUNTLET OF SEARCHES. HERE, FIND IT. TOTALLY. THERE'S A BLUE BOX RIGHT THERE. JUST DUMP IT IN THERE. SECURITY IS LOOKING FOR ANYTHING ILLEGAL BUT PARTICULARLY MDMA, KNOWN ON THE STREET AS ECSTASY OR MOLLY. ANYBODY PERSONALLY HAVE ANYTHING ON THEM? IT'LL BE, LIKE, MOLLY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU LOOK A LITTLE NERVOUS. THESE MEASURES CAN BE EFFECTIVE. THIS MAN HAS JUST BEEN BUSTED FOR POT. YOU'RE GONNA WALK RIGHT UP TO THAT BLUE BIN, OPEN IT UP, AND DUMP WHAT YOU GOT IN THERE. BUT FESTIVAL PROMOTERS CUT HIM A BREAK. RATHER THAN TURN HIM OVER TO LOCAL POLICE, HE'S ALLOWED TO GET RID OF HIS STASH AND ENTER FESTIVAL GROUNDS. SO, THE ORGANIZERS OF MYSTERYLAND SAY THEY TAKE SECURITY VERY SERIOUSLY, AND AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE ARE OFFICERS CHECKING EVERY SINGLE CAR. THERE ARE DRUG-SNIFFING DOGS. A PERSON COULD GET CHECKED UP TO THREE TIMES BEFORE THEY EVEN GET IN. WE, HOWEVER, HAVE TALKED TO A COUPLE OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET THEIR DRUGS IN ANYWAY. ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IS ODIN, A 27-YEAR-OLD EDM FAN FROM PORTLAND, OREGON. HE'S ARRIVED AT A SECOND CHECKPOINT WITH HIS MOLLY SECRETLY STASHED. IN SPITE OF A THOROUGH SEARCH AND FRISK, ODIN'S PLANS FOR PARTYING THIS WEEKEND REMAIN THOROUGHLY INTACT. BUT OUTSIDE THE TENT, THOUSANDS OF FANS LINE UP TO BE SEARCHED, MANY CARRYING PARTY DRUGS OF THEIR OWN. IT'S FRIDAY AFTERNOON. AN ARMY OF FESTIVAL-GOERS HAVE CLEARED SECURITY AND DESCEND ON MYSTERYLAND'S CAMPGROUNDS. THEY'RE TRANSFORMING THIS MOUNTAINTOP INTO A MAKESHIFT CITY FOR 15,000 EDM FANS. TONIGHT, THEY'LL BED DOWN AND AWAIT THE START OF THIS WEEKEND'S EXTRAVAGANZA. SATURDAY MORNING, CONCERT DOORS OPEN AT 1:00. AND RIGHT ON TIME, FESTIVAL-GOERS FLOCK TO THE GATES. MYSTERYLAND STARTS TODAY... TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PARTYING AND DANCING FOR TWO DAYS STRAIGHT. IT'S BEEN LIKE 20 YEARS SINCE MY LAST RAVE-LIKE ENVIRONMENT, SO I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE NOW. THIS IS LIGHT-YEARS AWAY FROM THE UNDERGROUND RAVES I WENT TO IN THE '90s. THIS YEAR'S SIZE SAYS IT ALL. EIGHT STAGES, 150 DEEJAYS, AND 50,000 FANS DANCING HARD ALL WEEKEND LONG. IT'S A UTOPIA FOR 20-SOMETHINGS, A CHANCE TO LET GO OF THE REAL WORLD AND EMBRACE WHATEVER HAPPENS. - KATHEL. - HEY! HOW ARE YOU? HEY. THIS IS CRAZY IN HERE. YEAH. THERE'S LIKE THOUSANDS OF TENTS. HOW ARE YOU? GREAT. IT'S A LITTLE METROPOLIS IN HERE. ONE PERSON EXCITED TO BEGIN THIS ADVENTURE IS 23-YEAR-OLD KATHEL FROM NEW YORK CITY. SHE'S PART OF A GROUP AT MYSTERYLAND WHO CALL THEMSELVES PLUR WARRIORS. THEY'RE A KIND OF SUBCULTURE WITHIN A SUBCULTURE. OH, WOW, YOU HAVE A NICE TENT. YOU ARE A PLUR WARRIOR. YES. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? BASICALLY, IN THE TIMES THAT WE ARE IN, WE NEED SOME CHANGE. SO, WITH PLUR, IT'S "PEACE, LOVE, UNITY, AND RESPECT," BUT WE ARE ALSO IN A TIME OF WAR, SO WE HAVE TO BE WARRIORS. PLUR WARRIORS... WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS SAY, "HEY, YOU'RE MY FRIEND. I'M YOUR FRIEND. WE'RE FROM TWO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND THAT SHOULDN'T MATTER." AND THESE KINDS OF FESTIVALS ARE JUST EXPLODING ALL OVER THE WORLD. WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS CULTURE MEANS TO YOUR GENERATION? I THINK WE HAVE THINGS LIKE 9/11, WE HAVE ALL THE WARS GOING ON, AND WE HAVE SOLDIERS COMING BACK NOT THEMSELVES, NOT THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE, AND WHEN THEY COME TO AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE THIS, I THINK MORE PEOPLE ARE REALIZING THAT THIS IS REALLY A PLACE OF LOVE, AND THEY'RE GONNA GET FULFILLED WITH THE LOVE THAT THEY'RE MISSING FROM THEIR DAILY LIVES. FOR KATHEL AND HER FRIENDS, PLUR ISN'T JUST A SLOGAN. IT'S ABOUT CHANGE AND PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION. FOR KATHEL, IT'S ONE THAT COMES WITHOUT DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. EVERYTHING AROUND YOU CAN CHANGE, BUT WHEN I GET ALL DRESSED UP, PEOPLE CAN STILL REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE JUST BASED ON LOOKING AT YOUR EYES. THIS IS THE ONLY THING I CAN REALLY CONTROL RIGHT NOW. IT'S LIKE A PEP TALK, LIKE, "HEY, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL TIME." TONIGHT, IT'S AN EXPLORATION OF SO MANY NEW PEOPLE TO MEET AND A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD TO EXPLORE. AT SUNSET, THE PLUR WARRIORS EMERGE. THEY'RE A TRIBE UNTO THEMSELVES, READY TO SPREAD THEIR MESSAGE OF PEACE, LOVE, UNITY, AND RESPECT. HOW ARE YOU? ON THEIR WAY TO THE STAGE, THEY MEET FANS AND FRIENDS AND TRADE BEADED PLASTIC JEWELRY CALLED CANDY... HOMEMADE SYMBOLS OF CONNECTION. CAN I GIVE YOU A SINGLE? YEAH. WHENEVER I GO TO TRADE WITH SOMEONE, WE'RE BOTH EQUAL. READY? THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS GENDER, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS RACE BECAUSE WE'RE ALL THERE FOR THE SAME EXACT REASON. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. FOR KATHEL AND HER FRIENDS, PLUR IS WHAT BINDS THEM TOGETHER. BUT IT'S THE MUSIC THAT KEEPS THEM COMING BACK FOR MORE. IN THIS NEW WORLD OF EDM, THE ROCK STARS ARE THE DEEJAYS, MAESTROS OF TECHNOLOGY WHO'VE DEVELOPED MASSIVE FOLLOWINGS OF THEIR OWN. ONE OF THE RISING STARS ON THE EDM SCENE IS A DEEJAY NAMED DENIS JASAREVIC, A.K.A. GRAMATIK. 40 YEARS AGO, ROCK STARS... YEAH. ...WERE THE BIGGEST CELEBRITIES IN THE WORLD. NOW... THEY STILL ARE. ...DEEJAYS... YEAH, BUT DEEJAYS ARE... WELL, YEAH. LIKE, WHEN I GO TO VEGAS, ALL THE SIGNS ARE FOR DEEJAYS. IT'S GETTING THERE. IT'S DEFINITELY GETTING THERE... YEAH. ...BECAUSE THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS JUST IDENTIFY MORE WITH TECHNOLOGY-BASED MUSIC, MUSIC THAT SOUNDS LIKE ROBOTS MADE IT OR WHATEVER, YOU KNOW? 'CAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE... ARE LIVING IN THIS, LIKE, TECHNOLOGY-INFUSED WORLD. EXACTLY, YEAH, AND THAT... I THINK IT CONNECTS TOGETHER, THE LIFESTYLE THEY'RE LIVING IN, WHICH IS VERY TECH-SAVVY. THEY'RE SPEAKING BINARY LIKE IT'S THEIR SECOND LANGUAGE, AND I THINK ELECTRONIC MUSIC, IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MUSICAL PRODUCT OF THAT EVOLUTION. I'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WITH ATTENDEES OF THIS FESTIVAL WHO SAY THAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH A LOT OF PRESSURE IN THEIR LIVES, HAVING A HARD TIME MAKING ENDS MEET. YEAH, EXACTLY. IT'S COLLEGE STUDENTS, YOU KNOW, TRAPPED IN COLLEGE LOANS, AND SO THEY COME HERE TO ESCAPE, TO BE INSPIRED BY MUSIC 'CAUSE LIFE IS HARD. THERE'S NO MYSTERY ABOUT THAT, YOU KNOW. SO MUSIC PROVIDES SOME SORT OF RELIEF FOR THAT. TONIGHT, I GET TO EXPERIENCE THIS SCENE FROM A NEW PERSPECTIVE... BACKSTAGE WITH GRAMATIK. INSTEAD OF PACKING INTO UNDERGROUND LOFTS LIKE WE USED TO DO, EDM AUDIENCES TODAY FROLIC IN STADIUM-SIZED VENUES LIKE THIS ONE. FROM CENTER STAGE, DEEJAYS LIKE GRAMATIK DELIVER THE GOODS... ...ELECTRONIC BEATS AND BREAKS BUILDING TO SOMETHING CALLED THE DROP. IT'S THE SONG'S CLIMAX. AND LIKE A SONIC TIDAL WAVE, IT SENDS THE AUDIENCE INTO A STATE OF EUPHORIA. THESE FANS ARE UNLIKE ANY I'VE EVER SEEN. THERE'S NO SHOVING, NO FIGHTS, JUST YOUNG PEOPLE CONNECTING TO THE MUSIC AND TO EACH OTHER. WHEN YOU GO TO MOST MUSIC FESTIVALS, YOU MAY HAVE SOME DRINKS, YOU MAY DANCE A LITTLE BIT, BUT THIS SHOW, EVERYONE WAS DANCING FOR HOURS ON END, AND PEOPLE WERE DRESSING OUTLANDISHLY. THIS IS THE FIRST GENERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO BE TOLD THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE MAKING AS MUCH MONEY AS THEIR PARENTS, AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THIS IS REALLY AN ESCAPE AND THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE GETTING A RELEASE FROM THE DAILY STRESSES OF LIFE BECAUSE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS MUSIC REALLY RESONATES WITH THIS GENERATION. NIGHTTIME, MYSTERYLAND. EIGHT STAGES CRANK OUT BEATS TO JOYFUL CROWDS. A GIANT DOME CALLED THE INCENDIA SPOUTS FIRE. FROM A CARNIVAL SWING, AIRBORNE FANS CHECK OUT THE SCENE. IT'S A TRIP. AND FOR MANY HERE, THE EXPERIENCE IS ENHANCED BY ONE KEY INGREDIENT... A DESIGNER DRUG CALLED MOLLY. THAT'S THE CASE FOR ODIN, FOR WHOM FESTIVALS AND MOLLY GO HAND IN HAND. I'VE BEEN TO FIVE OR SIX FESTIVALS AT THIS POINT, SO I'M PRETTY USED TO THE ROUTINE, AND I DON'T WANT TO BURN OUT EARLY IN THE FESTIVAL. THAT'S WHY I'M CHOOSING THE LAST DAY TO ROLL. IT'S A LOT TO PUT YOUR BODY THROUGH, AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND, SO I'VE LEARNED TO BE VERY STRATEGIC. I JUST WANT TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THE EXPERIENCE. ODIN HAS EXPERIMENTED WITH A NUMBER OF DRUGS, BUT HE BELIEVES MOLLY HAS IMPROVED HIS LIFE BY EXPANDING HIS HORIZONS AND OPENING HIS MIND. A LOT OF WHAT YOU GO THROUGH WHEN YOU COME TO A FESTIVAL IS A REBIRTH, IF YOU WILL. YOU FEEL LIKE A KID AT RECESS, AND DRUGS ARE AN AMPLIFICATION OF ALL THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT A PARTY, ALL THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT MUSIC. IT TAKES ALL THE BEST ELEMENTS, AND IT MAKES THEM THAT MUCH SWEETER. YOU THINK THESE FESTIVALS AND EVEN THE OCCASIONAL USE OF... OF, YOU KNOW, PARTY DRUGS LIKE MOLLY HAVE CHANGED YOU AS A PERSON? IT HAS GIVEN ME ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVE THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE WITHOUT HAVING TAKEN THE DRUGS IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT I THINK I DO SPEAK FOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HERE WHEN I SAY THAT WE WANT TO ENJOY THESE DRUGS HERE IN THIS SETTING, BUT WE'RE NOT JUST POPPING THESE THINGS EVERY WEEKEND. SOME PEOPLE ARE, AND THEY'RE GONNA BURN OUT PRETTY QUICK. SOME FESTIVAL-GOERS LIKE ODIN MANAGE TO SNEAK THEIR DRUGS PAST SECURITY. OTHERS WILL BUY THEM ON-SITE FROM DEALERS. THIS MAN AND HIS PARTNER ARE PREPARING TO SMUGGLE THEIR STOCKPILE OF CONTRABAND PAST SECURITY. YEAH. THESE MEN RUN A TIGHT-KNIT ENTERPRISE. HERE'S HOW IT OPERATES. STEP ONE... WRAP UP YOUR STASH IN LARGE PLASTIC BAGS, THEN STORE IT AWAY UNTIL SUNDOWN. STEP TWO... WHEN NIGHT FALLS, HEAD TO A DROP SPOT NEAR MYSTERYLAND TO TRANSFER THE GOODS TO A PARTNER OPERATING INSIDE. MY THOUGHT IS THAT WE WILL PULL OVER UP HERE A LITTLE BIT, AND IF SOMEBODY ACCUSES US OF TRESPASSING, WE WILL STATE THAT THE CAR BROKE DOWN AND WE WERE TRYING TO TAKE A SHORTCUT TO THE EVENT. STEP THREE... MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT ALL THE RIGHT TOOLS... YEAH, I GOT IT. ALL RIGHT, THANKS, MAN. ...INCLUDING A GOOD PAIR OF HIKING BOOTS. WE'RE GOING TO MEET DALE. HE'S GONNA TAKE THIS AND BRING IT TO OUR MAIN CAMPING AREA, AND WE DISTRIBUTE IT TOMORROW. HEY, WE'RE... WE'RE STILL ABOUT ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES, SO... ONCE YOU GET TO THE DROP SITE, UNLOAD THE STASH, THEN... FLEE THE VICINITY SURROUNDING MYSTERYLAND. AND FINALLY, STEP FOUR... WHEN DAYLIGHT BREAKS, WORK TO INCREASE SALES BY SOLICITING CONCERT-GOERS CAMPING NEAR THE FESTIVAL SITE. GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOU. THERE YOU GO. OH, LOVELY! WE'RE AT A CAMPGROUND OUTSIDE OF THE MYSTERYLAND VENUE WHERE HUNDREDS OF ATTENDEES ARE STAYING, AND THERE IS A VIGILANTE HERE WHO IS LITERALLY APPROACHING PEOPLE AND OFFERING A PRODUCT TO THEM THAT HE BELIEVES IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE EDM EXPERIENCE. ALL RIGHT, SO, SHOULD WE SPLIT THEM UP? HOW MANY... THAT VIGILANTE IS NAMED ADAM, AND WHAT HE'S SELLING AREN'T DRUGS. THEY'RE DRUG-TESTING KITS. IT'S A SIMPLE PRODUCT THAT CAN DETERMINE THE MIX AND POTENCY OF ILLICIT NARCOTICS IN SECONDS, AND LAST NIGHT, ADAM AND HIS PARTNER SMUGGLED IN ENOUGH KITS TO CONDUCT OVER 15,000 DRUG TESTS. ADAM'S OPERATION IS CALLED THE BUNK POLICE. HE BELIEVES DRUG USE IS INEVITABLE AND THAT HIS KITS HELP TO SAVE LIVES. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GET TO A FESTIVAL SITE? HAND OUT FLYERS AND TELL PEOPLE WHERE TO FIND US. "WHAT THE THIS SHIT IS BUNK!" SO, HOW IS THE RESPONSE TO THIS? EXCELLENT. YEAH, EVERYBODY'S BEEN, YOU KNOW, HAPPY THAT WE'RE HERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW ABOUT US. HOW DANGEROUS IS IT FOR PEOPLE TO BE BUYING DRUGS FROM RANDOM DEALERS OUT HERE? EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THOSE CAME FROM. THERE ARE QUITE A FEW DEATHS EVERY YEAR FROM ADULTERATED SUBSTANCES AND PERMANENT INJURIES THAT OCCUR, SO WE KNOW THAT THIS PREVENTS SOME OF THAT. SO, AT A FESTIVAL LIKE THIS WHERE YOU HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, WHAT PERCENTAGE WOULD YOU SAY WILL BE DOING DRUGS? DEPENDING ON THE FESTIVAL, AT LEAST 50%. THE DANGERS OF MOLLY AND OTHER NARCOTICS HAVE A LONG HISTORY. A WAVE OF 400 OVERDOSES IN THE LATE '90s LED TO A GOVERNMENT CRACKDOWN SPEARHEADED BY ONE MAN. I'M THE GUY THAT WROTE THE DRUG-COURT LEGISLATION THAT IS IN THE LAW RIGHT NOW. AS A SENATOR IN 2003, JOE BIDEN CONVINCED CONGRESS TO ENACT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION POPULARLY CALLED THE RAVE ACT. UNDER THAT TOUGH NEW LAW, EDM PROMOTERS ALLOWING OR APPEARING TO ALLOW DRUG USE FACED STIFF PENALTIES, EVEN JAIL TIME. THESE ARE OUR SECOND BATCH. THAT'S ONE REASON ADAM IS BANNED FROM SELLING HIS TESTING KITS ON MYSTERYLAND'S GROUNDS. THEIR PRESENCE COULD BE CONSTRUED AS CONDONING DRUG USE. WHEN I FIRST STARTED DOING THIS, WE WOULD REACH OUT TO FESTIVALS, TRYING TO GET THEIR APPROVAL, AND WE WOULD GET IGNORED, AND THAT IS ALL BECAUSE OF THE RAVE ACT. SO, BECAUSE OF THE RAVE ACT, YOU AREN'T ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR KITS FREELY? THAT'S RIGHT. FESTIVALS ARE SCARED OF THE LIABILITY THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY BRING TO THE SITUATION BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT OUR PRESENCE MEANS THAT THEY ARE ALLOWING DRUG USE TO OCCUR. SO, YOU ARE NOT AGAINST DRUG USE? IT'S NOT THE BEST IDEA IN MOST CASES. WE JUST KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST TRYING TO TAKE STEPS TO MAKE IT AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE. EVEN THOUGH ADAM IS NOT PRESENTLY ON MYSTERYLAND'S GROUNDS, HE CONTINUES TO OPERATE ON THE DOWN LOW WITH NEW CLIENTS. THIS IS OUR MARQUE TEST KIT. SO, HERE IS OUR SPECTRUM... OUR REACTION SPECTRUM. THIS YELLOW ONES RIGHT HERE ARE THE MOST COMMON ADULTERANTS, MOLLY, OR MDMA, LIKE MDPV, METHYLONE, MEPHEDRONE. BREAK OUT THE LITTLE TRUNK HERE. MOLLY IS OFTEN MIXED OR SUBSTITUTED WITH TOXIC ADDITIVES THAT CAN TRIGGER LETHAL REACTIONS. IS THAT ENOUGH? THAT'S PLENTY. BY TESTING A SMALL SAMPLE, ADAM'S KITS CAN DETERMINE THE PURITY OF SYNTHETIC DRUGS. TO SOME EXTENT, YOU KNOW, YOU WANT IT TO BE A KIND OF PURPLE AT FIRST AND THEN CHANGE TO BLACK OVER ABOUT FIVE SECONDS. A YELLOW REACTION INDICATES POTENTIALLY LETHAL IMPURITIES... A WARNING TO DRUG USERS TO AVOID A BAD BATCH. A BLACK REACTION IS PURE MOLLY, OR, AS IT'S CALLED BY EXPERTS, MDMA. WHAT DO WE GOT? IT IS TURNING PURPLE TO BLACK RELATIVELY QUICKLY, SO THAT MATCHES UP WELL WITH AN MDXX SUBSTANCE. MDA OR MDMA. YEP. AWESOME. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. IT'S AFTERNOON AT MYSTERYLAND. AFTER A LONG NIGHT OF HARD-CORE PARTYING, THE MEDICAL-CARE STATION ON-SITE IS SEEING A STEADY FLOW OF VISITORS. MOST OF THIS IS WHAT YOU'D EXPECT FROM AN OUTDOOR FESTIVAL... SPLINTERS, SPRAINED ANKLES, SUNBURN. BUT I'VE ALSO WITNESSED AMBULANCES TRANSPORT THE MORE SERIOUS CASES TO LOCAL HOSPITALS. OUTPOSTS LIKE THESE ARE NOW FIXTURES AT EDM FESTIVALS AND FOR GOOD REASON. MOLLY IS THE STREET NAME FOR A PURE FORM OF THE DRUG ECSTASY. IT'S BELIEVED TO HAVE CAUSED AT LEAST TWO DEATHS IN JUST THE PAST WEEK. THE CLARK COUNTY CORONER SAYS AUSTIN TOM DIED OF AN OVERDOSE OF ECSTASY. BUSINESS WAS BOOMING AT THE QUINCY VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER AS ONE AFTER ANOTHER, CONCERT-GOERS STUMBLED IN AFTER PARTYING TOO MUCH. PREVENTING DRUG-INDUCED DEATHS IS THE JOB OF DR. ANDREW BAZOS, WHO RUNS MYSTERYLAND'S MEDICAL UNIT. WELL, I THINK WITH THE WIND CHILL LAST NIGHT, WE WERE IN THE 30s. WAS THERE ANY HYPOTHERMIA? WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON DRUG-RELATED INJURIES THAT YOU ENCOUNTER? CERTAINLY, THE ONE THAT GETS MOST OF THE PLAY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IS MOLLY, BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE TOO MUCH OR IF YOU GET A BAD BATCH OF IT, IT CAN REALLY DO THINGS TO YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM, AND THAT'S WHERE YOU RUN INTO THESE OVERDOSE, SERIOUS PROBLEMS. DRUG-TESTING KITS ARE NOT ALLOWED INTO VENUES LIKE THIS. COULDN'T THEY HELP GIVEN THAT DRUGS ARE GOING TO GET IN DESPITE HOW RIGOROUS THE SEARCHES ARE? WE WORK WITH EUROPEAN COMPANIES THAT HAVE THESE FESTIVALS, AND DRUG TESTING IS VERY COMMON THERE, BUT WE STOP SHORT OF ON-SITE DRUG TESTING. BECAUSE OF THE RAVE ACT, YOU'RE REALLY CROSSING THE LINE, BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GIVING THEM A PRODUCT THAT USES AN ILLEGAL PRODUCT, YOU CAN MAKE THAT EXTENSION TO CONDONING IT, AND WE DON'T WANT THAT INTERPRETATION OUT THERE. NONE OF US CONDONE ANY DRUG USE WHATSOEVER. THE RAVE ACT WAS DESIGNED TO PROTECT FESTIVAL-GOERS, BUT SOME BELIEVE THE LAW IS SO FLAWED, IT PLACES YOUNG PEOPLE IN JEOPARDY. ONE SUCH CRITIC LIVES HERE IN RURAL VIRGINIA. HER NAME IS DEDE GOLDSMITH. WHERE ARE WE HEADED? WE'RE HEADED TO SHELLEY'S ROOM. WE'RE CALLING IT THE GUEST ROOM NOW. BUT IT'LL ALWAYS BE SHELLEY'S ROOM. IT'S JUST HARD FOR MY HUSBAND TO KEEP CALLING IT THAT. TWO YEARS AGO, DEDE AND HER HUSBAND, ROB, SUFFERED THE ULTIMATE LOSS. THEIR ONLY DAUGHTER, SHELLEY, DIED AFTER TAKING MOLLY. SHE SPENT A LOT OF TIME HERE. THIS IS WHERE SHE STUDIED. SHE REALLY WENT THE EXTRA MILE TO BE INFORMED, AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON I FEEL LIKE HER DEATH IS... JUST POIGNANT TO THE MESSAGE THAT IT CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY. STAR ATHLETE, SCHOLAR, SHELLEY WAS A CHERISHED DAUGHTER WHOSE TRAGIC DEATH BECAME HEADLINE NEWS. UVA HONORS STUDENT SHELLEY GOLDSMITH WAS ALSO 19 WHEN SHE, TOO, COLLAPSED AFTER A CONCERT AT ECHOSTAGE BACK IN THE SUMMER OF 2013. BUT WHEN SHELLEY DIED AT A D.C. NIGHTCLUB, THEY HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS TAKING MOLLY... OR EVEN WHAT IT WAS. THEY'VE SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS PIECING TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED TO HER, LIKE SHELLEY, WHO USED TO MAKE HER OWN JEWELRY, ONE BEAD AT A TIME. SHE GOT INTO JEWELRY MAKING IN A PRETTY SERIOUS WAY. MM, THAT'S NICE. YEAH. YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW... I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, BUT CANDY CULTURE... YEAH. ...IS A BIG PART OF THE EDM SCENE... ISN'T THAT INTERESTING? ...AND PEOPLE SPEND SO MUCH TIME MAKING THINGS LIKE THIS. THAT'S THE THING ABOUT EDM THAT STRIKES ME. IT'S JUST KIDS JUST WANTING TO BE KINDERGARTNERS AGAIN AND JUST PLAY AND HAVE A GOOD TIME. DON'T HAVE THE WORRIES OF THE WORLD ON THEIR SHOULDERS, AND THEY CAN JUST LET LOOSE. A LOT OF THESE EDM FESTIVALS AND EVENTS, THEY ARE THE SORT OF ATTEMPT TO CREATE THIS UTOPIC KIND OF... IT IS... UTOPIAS. WHAT CAN THE PERFECT WORLD LOOK LIKE? AND SHE WAS LIKE THAT FROM A VERY EARLY AGE, AND SHE HAD IT ALL GOING ON, EXCEPT THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DANGERS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MDMA. AND I COMPLETELY FAILED HER. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MDMA. BUT YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE, YOU BETTER KNOW THE RISKS, BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY OF THEM, NOT LEAST OF WHICH IS, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONCENTRATION IS. IF YOU'RE IN A BAD SETTING, IT COULD LEAD TO HYPOTHERMIA, CARDIAC ARREST, AND MAYBE KILL YOU, WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED TO SHELLEY. ROB AND DEDE WANT CONGRESS TO REVISE THE RAVE ACT SO THAT PROMOTERS CAN OFFER FREE ACCESS TO WATER, COOL-DOWN STATIONS, AND READILY-AVAILABLE MATERIALS LISTING THE DANGERS OF MOLLY. THEY'RE CONVINCED MEASURES LIKE THESE WILL PREVENT MORE TRAGEDIES. I THINK WE NEED THAT ASPECT OF THE COALITION BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL WORKING TOGETHER, AND WE WANT TO ADVOCATE FOR HAVING SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF MEDICAL PERSONNEL. BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED SINCE THEN, DO YOU THINK THAT SOMETHING COULD'VE BEEN DONE TO PREVENT YOUR DAUGHTER'S DEATH? YES. HAD SHE KNOWN ABOUT THE RISKS, SHE WOULD'VE KNOWN NOT TO DANCE HOURS ON END IN AN OVERHEATED ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD LEAD TO HEAT STROKE, AND HAD THE FACILITY OFFERED COOL-DOWN SPACES WHERE SHE COULD GO AND COOL DOWN OR HAD ADEQUATE PERSONNEL TO HANDLE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES, FREE WATER. I MEAN, THERE WERE LOTS OF THINGS THAT COULD HAVE SAVED HER LIFE. MDMA, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF HER DEATH. IT CERTAINLY WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO HELP MORE PEOPLE, MORE KIDS SURVIVE RISKY BEHAVIOR. WE'VE GOT A BAD DRUG POLICY THAT IS TRYING TO TAKE DRUGS AWAY FROM KIDS AT THE GATES, AND KIDS ARE STILL USING, SO WE STILL HAVE KIDS THAT NEED HELP RIGHT NOW. TONIGHT, I'M MAKING THE ROUNDS WITH CONNOR AND MIKE, TWO MOBILE MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL STAFF. SO, CONNOR, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR WHEN YOU GO OUT? SO, WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR ANYONE WHO JUST LOOKS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW? THEY'RE SORT OF, YOU KNOW, LAYING DOWN, OR THEY'RE JUST NOT LOOKING QUITE RIGHT. SO, WE WANT TO GIVE OUT A LOT OF WATERS, MAKE SURE THEY'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME, MAKING SURE EVERYTHING'S GOING ALL RIGHT FOR THEM. HEY, HOW'S IT GOING? EVERYTHING GOOD? EVERYTHING OKAY? YEAH, YEAH. ALL RIGHT, TAKE CARE. THESE AMBASSADORS, AS THEY'RE CALLED, CHECK IN WITH ANYONE APPEARING TO HAVE PARTIED TOO HARD. I'M MIKE. I'M A PARAMEDIC. EVERYTHING OKAY? OH, YEAH, I JUST HAD SOME DRINKS EARLIER. DRINK A LOT OF WATER. YEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. SEE YOU LATER. IT'S PART OF MYSTERYLAND'S PROACTIVE EFFORT TO CARE FOR FESTIVAL-GOERS WHO GO HARD THEN SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES. HEY, HOW ARE YOU? YOU WANT A BOTTLE OF WATER OR ANYTHING? BUT FOR CRITICS LIKE DEDE AND ROB, THESE EFFORTS FALL SHORT OF MORE EFFECTIVE MEASURES THAT COULD SAVE LIVES BUT, IRONICALLY, ARE ILLEGAL. IT'S MORNING AT A CAMPGROUND JUST OUTSIDE MYSTERYLAND. VERA, WHO I MET FLYING SOLO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEKEND, IS GETTING READY FOR ANOTHER DAY AT THE CONCERT. I WAS REALLY NERVOUS IN THE BEGINNING AND GETTING BUTTERFLIES. THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW ARE MY EX, HIS CREW. THAT'S IT. BUT I NEED TO GO ON THIS JOURNEY FOR ME, AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY STOPPING ME. VERA TOLD ME HER DECISION TO COME ON HER OWN TO THE CONCERT HAS HELPED HER CONNECT WITH NEW PEOPLE. MIKE?! - DID YOU EAT? - I HAD A HOT DOG. DO YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME? YEAH. IS THAT COOL? HER NEW FRIEND MIKE HAS BECOME NOT JUST A FESTIVAL BUDDY BUT A CONFIDANTE. SO, I CALLED MY EX. HE'S LIKE, "YOU'RE NOT STILL GOING TO MYSTERYLAND, ARE YOU?" I'M LIKE, "OH, OH, YES." VERA'S JOURNEY OF SELF-DISCOVERY IS ENTWINED WITH THIS CONCERT'S ICONIC LOCATION... THE WOODSTOCK MUSIC FESTIVAL. THAT PIVOTAL EVENT INSPIRED VERA AND MANY OTHERS WHO'VE COME HERE ON A QUEST FOR ANSWERS... ABOUT WAR, THE ECONOMY, AND THEIR FUTURE. AND FOR SOME, THAT INSPIRATION INCLUDES ANOTHER LEGACY OF THE '60s... MIND EXPANSION. WE'RE SITTING ON THE SITE OF THE WOODSTOCK MUSIC FESTIVAL, PROBABLY THE MOST ICONIC FESTIVAL EVER. YEAH. DO YOU FEEL THAT IN THE AIR? THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE COME TO BE OPEN, TO BE ACCEPTING, TO RE-EXPERIENCE THE JOY OF FRIENDSHIP, AND, ALSO, YOU TAKE DRUGS HERE AT A MUSIC FESTIVAL BECAUSE THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE AROUND PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR. WHAT KIND OF WORK DO YOU DO? I WORK IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY. SO, ARE YOU A DIFFERENT PERSON DURING THE WEEK? I HAVE THE SAME GENERAL ATTITUDE. I DEFINITELY HAVE A FEW LESS DRINKS, BUT THIS IS THE WEEKEND. THIS IS THE TIME TO PARTY. AND CAN I ASK YOU WHAT KINDS OF RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES YOU'RE GOING TO BE PARTAKING IN TODAY? ECSTASY. THAT'S THE PLAN FOR TONIGHT. IT SHOULD BRING OUT THE CONTOURS OF THE MUSIC, AND WE WILL DANCE ALL NIGHT LONG, I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT. FOR ODIN, TAKING MOLLY TONIGHT WILL BE HIS WAY OF ENDING THE FESTIVAL ON A HIGH NOTE. HEY! HEY, WHAT'S UP? BUT FOR CHRIS, GIL, AND THEIR CREW, THIS WEEKEND IS NOT JUST A CELEBRATION BUT A TIME TO PAY RESPECT TO THOSE WHO'VE SERVED. HAVE YOU EVEN THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT YOUR LIFE OUTSIDE OF THIS PLACE? NO. LIKE, I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT WORK ON TUESDAY. THE ONLY THING ON MY MIND IS THAT TOMORROW'S MEMORIAL DAY. HE'S FROM THE SAME BATTALION AS I AM... 214 INFANTRY, 2nd BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM. WE LOST THREE SOLDIERS. TOMORROW'S MEMORIAL DAY, SO WE'RE GOING ALL THE OUT FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE HERE. AND IT'S NOT ONLY FOR THEM, THOUGH. IT'S FOR EVERYBODY. IT'S ALL THE MEN. IT'S ALL THE SOLDIERS. WE GOT FIVE RIGHT HERE. SO, THERE ARE FIVE VETERANS. YOU WERE DEPLOYED IN AFGHANISTAN. SO WAS HE. HE'S GONNA GO NEXT MONTH. OH, GOD. I MEAN... IT'S HIS SECOND TOUR. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU TO HAVE THIS PLACE WHERE LOVE IS BEING SPREAD GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE DEPLOYED NEXT MONTH? I'M KIND OF USING, LIKE, THIS EXPERIENCE AS, LIKE, MY LAST TIME TO HAVE, LIKE, AN ACTUAL GOOD TIME 'CAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? HE MIGHT DIE. IT'S, LIKE, MY LAST TIME TO HAVE AN ACTUAL GOOD TIME WITH MY BUDDIES. SOLDIERS, HIPSTERS, BROS, AND BABES. MYSTERYLAND HAS A DIVERSE MIX OF CLANS AND CULTURES, ONE THAT'S UNIQUELY RED, WHITE, AND BLUE. I THINK THE SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN FESTIVALS IN AMERICA IS MORE INTENSE. IT'S MORE COMMITTED TO THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE AND THE CULTURE BECAUSE IT STARTED HERE, YOU KNOW? DO YOU NOTICE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE ONSTAGE WHO ARE HIGH OR ROLLING? WELL, YEAH, I NOTICE THEM, BUT SO FAR, IT'S NEVER BEEN LIKE, "OH, WOW, THIS WHOLE CROWD IS DRUGGED OUT." WHY DO YOU THINK MOLLY AND ECSTASY ARE SO PREVALENT AT ELECTRONIC SHOWS? BECAUSE THEY DO SOMETHING TO YOUR BRAIN THAT THE CHEMICAL RELEASE MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE, "I LOVE LIFE, I LOVE THIS MUSIC, I LOVE EVERYBODY AROUND ME, AND THIS IS REALLY AWESOME," AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S REALLY POPULAR. PROBLEM IS, WHEN YOU BUY DRUGS ON THE STREETS AND THEN YOU GET NON-PURE DRUGS, PEOPLE END UP IN ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE BECAUSE OF IT. NIGHTTIME, MYSTERYLAND. THE SCENE IS ALIVE WITH COSTUME AND COLOR. FOR THOSE ROLLING ON MOLLY, THE EFFECTS ARE ESPECIALLY MESMERIZING. IT'S TIME TO MEET ODIN. HE TOLD ME HE'D BE TAKING MOLLY TONIGHT AND TO MEET HIM BY THE CARNIVAL SWINGS, BUT RIGHT NOW, HE APPEARS TO HAVE LEFT THE FESTIVAL GROUNDS. THE BEST PART OF TAKING DRUGS AT A MUSIC FESTIVAL IS THE FEELING OF WEIGHTLESSNESS. IT FEELS LIKE FLYING. WE ALL KNEW WHAT THAT FELT LIKE ONCE, BUT WE LET PROBLEMS CREEP INTO OUR LIVES, AND IT TAKES A MOMENT OF CELEBRATION TO FORGET ALL THOSE PROBLEMS, TO ENJOY ALL THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU, AND TO SHARE THE LOVE. ODIN! HEY, HOW ARE YOU? LISA! I'M ECSTATIC! NO PUN INTENDED. OKAY, I JUST HAVE ONE, ONE, ONE QUESTION FOR YOU. YEAH. HOW ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW? I AM ON CLOUD NINE... NO, CLOUD 99. BETTER THAN YOU WERE TODAY? BETTER THAN EVER. I'M HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE. I'M WITH THE BEST FRIENDS YOU COULD EVER ASK FOR, AND THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT YOU WAIT FOR. THIS IS... HEAR THAT? HEAR THE DROP COMING? THIS IS WHAT I FEEL RIGHT NOW... THE RELEASE. IT'S THE BEST. AWESOME. TAKE CARE. ODIN IS JUST ONE OF MANY HAPPY, HIGH CAMPERS HERE, A LIST THAT INCLUDES CHRIS AND GIL, BOTH OF WHOM ARE DOWN AT THE MAIN STAGE, ROLLING HARD ON MDMA. WHEN YOU'RE ROLLING, IT HITS YOU LIKE A BRICK WALL. IT'S INSANE. IF THERE'S A GOOD TRACK PLAYING AND I'M ROLLING, I CANNOT STAY STILL. I HAVE TO DANCE. I HAVE TO GRAB MY FRIENDS BY THE HAND AND SAY, "HEY, BRO, LET'S GO DANCE, MAN. LIKE, LET'S GO GET CRAZY." FOR PARTYERS LIKE CHRIS AND GIL, MOLLY AND EDM ARE ONE AND THE SAME. BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE FOR EVERYONE I'VE MET HERE AND CERTAINLY NOT FOR VERA. SO, HOW'S IT BEEN? IT'S BEEN AWESOME. IT'S... THE VIBE IS GREAT. THE MUSIC'S BEEN GREAT. IT'S JUST OVERALL FREAKIN' AMAZING, INCREDIBLE TO BE AT WOODSTOCK. IT'S AWESOME. WHY IS IT SO AMAZING? JUST... LOOK AT ALL OF THIS. LOOK AT IT. IT'S... YOU COME IN. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW... LIKE, I'VE SEEN PICTURES, BUT THE PICTURES DON'T EVEN DO IT JUSTICE. AND ARE YOU... ARE YOU ON ANYTHING AT ALL? NO, I'M COMPLETELY SOBER. COMPLETELY? COMPLETELY SOBER. NO WEED, ALCOHOL? NO WEED, NO ALCOHOL, NO NOTHING. I SEE THAT YOU'RE HANGING OUT WITH A GUY A LOT. WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? I ACTUALLY MET HIM WHEN I PULLED INTO CAMPING, AND HE'S SOLO, TOO, SO... BUT IT'S NOT ROMANTIC OR ANYTHING? NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. OH, MY GOSH, NO. IT WAS JUST FRIENDLY VIBES AND JUST HANGING OUT. I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT MYSELF. I HAVE MET WAY MORE PEOPLE THAN I WOULD HAVE IF I CAME WITH A GROUP. IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE. I'VE ALSO BEEN ON A JOURNEY HERE, RETURNING TO A SUBCULTURE WHERE I CAME OF AGE AND ENCOUNTERING A NEW GENERATION WHO, LIKE ME BACK THEN, ARE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT LIES IN STORE FOR ODIN, CHRIS, KATHEL, AND VERA, BUT TONIGHT, NOTHING REALLY MATTERS... EXCEPT THE MUSIC, THE MOMENT... AND THE DROP. WELL, MYSTERYLAND IS OVER, AND I HAD A GREAT TIME. WHILE I SPENT A LOT OF TIME AT RAVES IN THE '90s, THESE FESTIVALS ARE AT A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL. MORE THAN ANY OTHER MUSIC GENRE, THIS ONE WELCOMES EVERYONE. AND EVERY KIND OF PERSON IS THERE HAVING A GOOD TIME. AND I REALLY HOPE THAT THE EXPERIENCE THIS WEEKEND WAS EVERYTHING THAT THE PEOPLE WE SPENT TIME WITH WANTED IT TO BE. FOR TWO NIGHTS, THESE YOUNG PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. THEY DIDN'T THINK ABOUT HOW HARD LIFE AND WORK CAN BE. THEY DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THE STRIFE IN THE NEWS. THEY JUST HAD THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES AND DIDN'T HAVE A CARE IN THE WORLD. THEY JUST DANCED. AND THEY DANCED HARD.
