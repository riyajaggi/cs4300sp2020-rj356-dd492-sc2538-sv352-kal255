 Titanic (2012): Season 1, Episode 4 - Episode #1.4 - full transcript 
 After RMS Titanic strikes the iceberg passengers and crew face a life or death situation. Paolo desperately tries to save his brother who has been locked in a cupboard with the Italian stewards. Mabel Watson is locked in a stateroom while she is desperately looking for her book. Jim Maloney finds himself having to rescue one of this children. John and Muriel Batley cling to life on wreckage after the ship goes down as do many other of the passengers. Only one of the life boats returns to rescue those in the water. For the most part, they are too late. Most of the passengers will die, though a few will survive, some by their bravery and some others through deceit.

 (Rumbling) (Indistinct conversations) How did you manage to get rid of the dreaded Rushtons? I just didn't invite them. Sometimes the old ways are the best. Besides, if anyone had chucked, we'd be 13 at table. Wouldn't risk that in the middle of an ocean. Nor me. I'm far too superstitious. Why was the captain so surprised by our Italian waiter? They're all Italian in here. But this is an Italian restaurant.

 The first-class dining room is not. What does it matter? How funny we are, with all our little rules for everything. Don't you think people are getting tired of it? I don't just mean rebels. Normal people. Like you, you mean? (Laughing) Yes. Yeah. Your mother has invited us up to Newport while we're in America. Do you think they're trying to match-make behind our backs? Not behind my back. I told her to invite you. I hope you don't mind. (Indistinct conversations)

 (Indistinct conversations) Have you given up your card game? No. I'm the dummy. Ah. I find that very hard to believe. Only for a hand of bridge. And don't you forget it. (Chuckles) Oh. That tiresome Mrs. Rushton been giving you a hard time? I'm afraid the passenger list doesn't meet her high expectations. Nor does her own background, if you ask me. I thought Americans weren't aware of such things. Oh, we're aware of them. We just don't care about them. Well, there speaks the voice of the future. I hope so. Or can't I say that? You can say anything you like to me. - ANDREWS: Miss Gibson? - Hmm? We made four spades. It's your deal. Duty calls. I wish it didn't. Your partner played a very good game. Something of an upset... Evening, Mrs. Brown. Good evening. There you are. You looked kind of lonely in the dining room tonight. Should have come over and joined us. Oh, no. We were quite happy by ourselves. Weren't we, Joseph? But that's kind of you, Mrs. Brown. Thank you. Is it your first trip to New York? For me, yes. But my husband is quite a traveler. Me too. I've been most everywhere. Heavens. What does Mr. Brown say about that? Not a word. He isn't with me any more. JOSEPH: Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, don't be. He's not dead. He's just having fun someplace else. Thank God he's got enough money. Neither of us has to go short. (Laughs) How reassuring. I thought everyone knew my story. - Is it a long one? - Nope. Jim started out on a dirt farm in Colorado. Next thing you know, he's discovered gold and we're loaded. Gives one faith in fairy tales, don't it? It certainly does. Why didn't you go to Gatti's with the rest of your table? Well, we didn't... We weren't invited. Ah. Their loss. Really. It's like being forced to talk to some streetwalker from Drury Lane. And why did you have to tell her we weren't invited?! Oh, because she asked. (Sighs) I'm going to bed. I'll see you later. There's no point in sulking. JIM: I'm not sulking. I'm angry. There's a difference. Well, either way, it won't do you much good on board a ship. You knew he was trouble, didn't you? Right from the start. I did. I knew he was trouble. But to kiss you like that, against your will. When he and I had talked together, drank together. He'd better not try anything like that again, or I will not be held answerable for my actions. He won't kiss me against my will. That I can promise. All right. I'll drop it. Mary. In a few days, we'll be in New York... with a completely different life ahead of you. Are you excited? Don't say that. Why not? I don't want a completely different life. I want my life. Our life. I do. Just hold me. What are we running at now? Just over 21 knots. Captain will be pleased. I'm not convinced he's right. You heard Ismay. White Star deals in luxury, not speed. Ismay's an old woman. But why take a risk when there's no need to? What risk? This sea's like a millpond. Exactly. That means no foam at the base of a rock or an iceberg. And they've no binoculars in the crow's nest. I think it's damn stupid. I should watch whom you say that to, Mr. Murdoch, or you'll find yourself in the brig. It's too late. He won't want to be bothered. Oh, yes, he will. He will. Come. Mario! We were coming to find you. You don't bring a girl like that near my cabin. Perhaps not. Miss Desmond. I guessed. I told him it was too late. It's not. I'm happy to meet you. You make quite an impression on my impressionable little brother. I do speak a bit of Italian. The answer is he has asked me, and I haven't said yes. But you haven't said no. You've come to meet me. I take that as a very good sign. It may be a good sign, but it's also bad discipline. So I'm off to bed before I get caught in this part of the ship. Good night, Mr. Sandrini. Pleased to have met you. (Man snoring) What's the matter now? I keep thinking about Suki. She's fine. She's not fine. She's in a cage. All alone... in the dark. She's also a dog. You've heard the phrase "it's a dog's life." - It's never been my dog's li... (Bell ringing) (Ringing continues) What did you see? Thank you. Iceberg right ahead. Hard a starboard! HICHENS: Hard a starboard, sir. (Clanking) How is hard a starboard, sir? Turn, will you? You just damn well turn. (Rumbling) (Scraping) Find Captain Smith and tell him what's happened. What did I say? How bloody... bloody stupid. (Moans softly) Oh, can you turn that off? JOHN: I think you should wake up. Why? What's happened? We've hit an iceberg. At... At least w-we've scraped along one. I was on deck, and... and suddenly it was there, right next to the ship, just towering over me. Everything towers over you. I'm serious. Well, what do you expect me to do about it? There's nothing anyone can do. (Door opens) - EMMA: Madame! Madame! (Speaking French) The ship is sinking! We have no time to lose! (Speaking French) - Giglio, is this true? I'm afraid so, Mr. Guggenheim. So I suppose Sagesser is right and we should get up? It's very inconvenient, but I don't think there's any way around it. (Speaking French) GUGGENHEIM: Giglio, escort Madame Aubart and her maid back to her cabin. It would not do for a steward to find them here. And if I drown, I do not care to feature in a newspaper story. (Speaking French) And, Giglio? In future, let's never be in a disaster with foreigners. I am a foreigner, sir. (Indistinct conversations) It's not even half full! Stop! LADY DUFF GORDON: What can we do? We can't bring it back, my lord. Where's Miss Watson? She went back to her cabin for a book. Though why it's taking her so long... Oh, my. You should have gone. I should have made you go. So you can make me do things now, can you? I wish I could. Start bolting them all. We may have steerage passengers through here before the night's out, and I don't want any looting. Might as well go to the thieves as the fishes. That's exactly the kind of talk we neither want nor need. Yes, sir. (Keys jingling) (Latches clicking) (Rattling) Hello?! Hello?! Can anyone hear me? (Knocking) Hello! Is anyone there? Help! (Indistinct conversations) GEORGIANA: Harry! Harry! - Harry! - Are you all right? You must get to a boat straightaway. They're full back there, or at least there's a queue that'll fill them. But there are some at the end that are still taking on women. I was coming to fetch my mother, but Father says she's already on one of these. We're going to wave her goodbye. After that, I'll come and look for you. I just hope I don't find you. Why? Because I want you to be safe. Georgiana, if I don't make it... Don't say that! Men will get through this... in first, in second, and in steerage. They'll live. Just make sure that you're one of them. Please! Well, if I'm not, I want you to know that if there was any truth in what we're taught, I'm gonna make you lucky all your life. So every time that you catch that train and every time that you find something you thought you'd lost... it'll be me. I love you, Harry Widener. You're the first man I've ever said that to. I hope I live to be the last. But if I don't, be happy. Or I'll want to know the reason why. Georgiana, come on. I refuse to say goodbye. Me too. But if you want to please me, just get on a boat. Georgiana, come on. (Rattling) (Gasps) BARNES: Miss Watson, are you in there? Mr. Barnes? They've locked the door! Don't worry. I have the key. No, no! It's no good! Stand back! Hang on a minute! You can't do that! Yeah. You watch me. (Grunts) (Keys jingling) Wait! I shall have to report you for spoiling White Star property. For spoiling it? Your proof will be 100 fathoms deep. Now, come on, man! (Gasps, sobs) - Miss Watson. That doesn't make it all right, you know. You shouldn't have gone off like that, not without telling me. I went for my... my book. It was stupid. - I thought it was in my cabin... - I have your book. I was going to give it to you later. I've mended it, and you can hardly see the tear. That was very kind. I... I'm sorry for making such a fuss about it. You don't have to apologize to me. You would never have to apologize to me. Not in this world. Don't talk as if this is goodbye. Yeah. Well, it may be. And I don't think we need to argue about that. Now, come on. We have got to get you into a boat. This is folly! What chance do the dogs have down in the hold? - Now, get on the boat! - GRACE: No! (Dogs barking) - Suki! (Gasps) Thank you! Get on board. Joseph. Give her to me. I'll see your wife gets her. Thank you. Go. Go. No dogs on the boats. Oh, for God's sake. - MAN: That's enough! - JIM: Get your hands off her! No! He's helping! He's helping! MURDOCH: Women and children come through first. HUGH: Get your children. MURDOCH: Stand back. Stand back! HUGH: Let these children through! - MURDOCH: That's enough! - HUGH: Let them through! MURDOCH: We're full! We're going to lower! You will not! Now, let them through! Get them on. Here we are. Get them on. MURDOCH: Hart! Hart! Get in there and take charge! Yes, sir. MURDOCH: Stand back, I tell you. Hart! We must lower now. Any more and the boat will split! It's gonna break! The boat's gonna break! No, darling. Of course... (Gasps) Theresa! Theresa! We must get off! We can't leave without my child! Stay with the others! I'll find her! - Don't worry. - MURDOCH: Stand back! Stand back! Theresa! (indistinct shouting) Help him! Please help him find her. MURDOCH: Lower away. Mary, remember me. Theresa! (Breathing heavily) Theresa! Darling? We should split up. You try the dining room. Go. (Shouting in distance) The boats from here have gone! Get back! The boats have gone! (Crowd screaming) (Gunshot, screaming stops) Now... remove to the stern and wait for rescue! Fat lot of good that'll do. Come on. Let's see what we can find. There's no point hanging on here. There's no point in doing anything. Come on! - HARRY: Georgiana! - Harry! Oh, my God. I hoped you'd gone. I prayed you'd gone. No. We've been unlucky. - Widener? - Hurry. They've got one of the collapsibles onto a davit, and they're loading it now. It may be the last boat to get away. Good. Come on. HARRY: It's through here. Left. HUGH: Darling, come along. Up you go. Miss Watson, I wonder if I may have a word. You'd better make it quick, Mr. Barnes. They won't go without you. What is this? It's a letter to show my appreciation. Don't open it now. I've got to go. We will meet again soon. You'll just think of me sometimes. That's all I ask. YOUNG MAN: Jack! Jack Thayer! You didn't get off on a boat? No, apparently not. I was too old for "women and children only," despite my mother's spirited attempts. They were taking some men on this side earlier. - Well, they didn't take me. - So what are you gonna do? Swim for it, I guess. I think it's safer if we climb down one of these ropes. There's nothing safe about it. When the time comes, I'm jumping out as far as I can. Lady Manton, the boat must go! GEORGIANA: Please, Mama. Come with me, please. She needs you. She hasn't needed me since she was 10. Well, she needs you now. You have to go. I will take care of her. Your other daughter. I will take care of both your daughters. I promise. I love you. GEORGIANA: (Crying) Mama, get in the boat! Mama, please. We need another man. MURDOCH: Officer Lowe. You go. I don't have to, sir. Get in. Aye, sir. MURDOCH: Lower away. (Indistinct conversations) MAN: Keep her level, now. That's it. Ease her down. Keep her level. Keep it steady. Keep it steady. (Shouting in Italian) Help! Mario! MAN: Theresa?! Here! Help! Help! Please. Please help me. I beg you! I beg you! Please help me. Help me. Help me! Paolo! Paolo! Do you have you a piece of wire? A buckle? A key? Something? Wait. (Men shouting) What's that? Something I was given to open a lock that didn't need it. Let's hope to God it works on this one. (inhales deeply) (Exhales deeply) - Any good? (Shouting continues) The pressure is keeping it closed! Mario! Push it out and keep it open until the pressure evens! Mario! Mario! Thank you. Thank you. You're a good man. - Thank you. - No. No, I'm not. At least if you die now, you go straight to heaven. Not many would agree. But good luck. The last boats have gone, sir. They've launched one of the collapsibles, and they're trying to get another into the davits now. (Shouting in distance) You should go. There is no obligation to go down with the ship, sir. Isn't that for me to judge? Mr. Ismay got away. He stepped into the boat just as it was going down. Lowe and I could have grabbed him out, I suppose, but we didn't. I'm glad of it. Let Ismay be the coward of Titanic, whereas I'm just the fool who sank her. You're being very hard on yourself, sir. You should get going. And if you manage to get out of this, please don't think too harshly of me. And tell Mrs. Smith my last thoughts were of her. Theresa! THERESA: Da! Da! Theresa? THERESA: Da! (Grunts) Oh, my God. Don't cry. I'm here now. Daddy's here. But what will we do, Da? (Grunts) I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to sit here and hold each other tight. But what happens then? Doesn't matter what happens then. We're together now, my darling. Everything's gonna be all right. Your daddy loves you so much. (indistinct shouting) LIGHTOLLER: Everyone lift on the count of three. One, two, three. Lift! Come on! Harder! Come on! Lift! (Grunting) Come on! (Rumbling) What is that? (Rumbling intensifies) I love you. JOHN: Keep hold of it. John! Muriel! - Muriel! - John! (indistinct shouting) - Loraine! (Crying) Hold on to Mama, darling! (Screams) - MAN: Oh! Here goes! (Splashing) (Gasping) (Shouting in distance) Widener! Is that you?! Is that you, Widener?! Widener! Just hold on! The boats will be back in a moment! (Metal clanging) (Shouting in distance) (Creaking) Paolo! Paolo! Up you come, mate. You're all right. Paolo! Paolo! Paolo! (Metal creaking) (Shouting in distance) (Shouts in Italian) Paolo! (Gasps) No. Paolo! Paolo! (Screaming, crashing in distance) MAN: Help me! Help me! (Grunting) (Screaming continues) (Woman sobbing) (Water splashing in distance) Well, Francatelli, there goes that beautiful nightdress you were so proud of. (indistinct shouting) (Gasps) Muriel. Muriel? Muriel! I'm coming! I'm coming! (Gasping) Muriel. Muriel. (Gasps) Muriel. And don't worry. They'll be coming for us soon. (Shouting in distance) GEORGIANA: We must go back! Of course we must go back. WOMAN: We'll be swamped! It will sink us for sure. We can't! We mustn't! Do I understand, madam, that you've left no husband behind? Officer, take us back at once! I will go back, but I must make some space in the boat to take survivors. LYONS: How? You ain't gonna chuck us overboard. Row towards the others. We'll make a pontoon, and we'll empty one of the lifeboats. No more room here! Clear off! - It's the second officer! - Well, I can't help that. Take my hand, sir. (Grunting) (Shouting in distance) Are you refusing to go back? I am. But this is outrageous. Do you have any idea of what would happen if we did? There'd be a hundred people trying to climb aboard in less than a minute. I doubt there'd be a hundred still alive by the time we got back. Why don't you pipe down? WOMAN: How dare you. Don't you know you're speaking to a countess? I don't care if I'm speaking to the king of Zanzibar. I'm not going back, and that's that! Muriel. Don't go. Muriel, don't go. Not like this. No. We should try. It's not right if we don't even try. What do you feel, my dear? I don't think we should. We're all upset enough as it is. HAWKINS: That's not the point. There's hardly any of us in this boat. We must go back. I don't agree. It could be very dangerous. I think we should just wait and see what happens. We know what will happen. They'll all drown. I tell you what. If we get home, I'll give every one of you a fiver. How's that? Do you think that was wise? Well, I've said it now. LIGHTOLLER: Steady. Easy. Easy. Easy. Left. - All right. Balance out. - MAN: Right. LIGHTOLLER: Right. - Right again. - MAN: That's it. LIGHTOLLER: Come on! Right. Easy. Easy. Balance. Easy. (Breathing heavily) There's no room, son. WOMAN: Easy. Oh, be careful. Can I ask you to transfer into this boat please, madam? I don't think I could do that. I'm afraid I must insist. Oh, for heaven's sake, we're not dancing a minuet. If he asks you to get out of the boat, you get out of the boat! Well, I'm not accustomed to being spoken to in that manner. Come on. Hurry. Officer, this is taking forever. Sir. Sir, you must get started. You... You too, madam. Madam'? (Breathing heavily) This one's dead. Then let him down... gently. (Breathing heavily) Should we say a prayer? We must be quite a mixture when it comes to worship, so what about the Lord's Prayer? Any objections? No. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation... We're going back, and I don't want to hear another word about it. We are not. And nor do I! Come on. Who can row? Mrs. Widener? - WOMAN: I will. - WOMAN 2: We can. - Move! - I won't allow this. I'm in command here! I advise you to get out of the way unless you want to be thrown overboard! I'll take the tiller. LOWE: Can anyone hear me?! Is there anyone alive out there?! Make a noise if you can! Can anyone hear me?! What's that? Steady. Hello? Can you hear me? JOHN: Yes. (Grunts) It's... It's my wife, you see. I don't want to leave her. I think she'd understand. MRS. BROWN: Don't worry. It's all right. That's it. We'll bring you in. I think he's dead, sir. LOWE: I saw something. Pull him in. LYONS: Come on. Come on! One, two, three! (Grunting) (Indistinct conversations) D-Did you find anyone? LOWE: Only three. One's already dead and another may not make it. (Gasps) Oh, my God. Papa! Paolo! Paolo! Paolo. He's gone, I'm afraid. There was only a flicker left when we found him. Did you know him well? I-I was going to marry him. I just hope to God he knew it. (Georgiana sobbing) I'm very sorry, Lady Manton. No! Not yet. He's so cold. Isn't there anything we can do to warm him? DOROTHY: Wait. Wait. Wait. I have brandy! Look! Hang on. Hang on. Wait. - Here. (Cork squeaks) Come on. Just what I brought it for. (Coughs) (Women gasp) (inhales sharply) LOUISA: Thank God. Thank God. I'm... so sorry, my dear. There's a boat! Ahoy there! LOWE: Mr. Lightoller? Is that you? It is, but hurry. GRACE: Mrs. Astor? I've got Kitty for you. BARNES: Dear Mabel... If I may... I have taken the liberty of enclosing my will, which you see has been properly witnessed by two of the passengers. I don't believe it matters whether or not they survive. I haven't much to leave, but there is a small house in Reading, presently let, which I think should see your father out of difficulty. It comes with my best wishes for your continued health. Yours respectfully, Kenneth Barnes. What's that? GEORGIANA: What? What is it? That light. Didn't anyone else see a light flickering on the horizon? Mr. Lightoller, didn't you see it? Mother! Mother! Jack? I told you I'd be fine. And I am! I'm perfectly fine! (Voice breaking) Jack. What do you think, Lowe? You're right, sir. I think you're right. That will be Carpathia.
