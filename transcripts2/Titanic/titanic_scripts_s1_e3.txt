 Titanic (2012): Season 1, Episode 3 - Episode #1.3 - full transcript 
 Second-class passenger Peter Lubov is an anarchist and a wanted man. Theresa Maloney is instantly attracted to him and they kiss, only to be caught by her husband Jim. Paolo got his position on board as a steward courtesy of his brother Mario who got one of the regular employees drunk. He has a dream of living in America where everyone has the opportunity to improve himself. He and Annie become close. Mabel Watson admits to having taken a brooch from her mistress' jewel case. After the iceberg hits, Lubov and Jim put their differences aside to ensure that Theresa and the children get safely aboard one of the boats. When Mario tries to intervene and open the doors for second class passengers, he finds himself locked away.

 - MAN: Mr. Churchill. - CHURCHILL: Well? MAN: We've found the bodies of two of them. Svaars and Solokow. And what about the others? I must have the leader. - Peter Piatkow? - Yes, Peter Piatkow. Peter the Painter. Policeman-killer-in-chief. Where is he? No sign of him, I'm afraid, sir. We're not even certain he was in the house.

 Some of the men thought they saw him, but we can't be sure. He was in here, all right, and I want him found. I've brought the army out onto the streets of London for this, and Parliament will be baying for my blood if all I've got to show for it are two accomplices. I don't care how long it takes or how much it costs. I want him found. 40,000 eggs. Yes, sir. (Men arguing) 2,500 onions. Yes, sir. MAN: ...that man is not getting onto that ship. Do you understand me?

 Pitman! Take over here. MAN: Mr. Lightoller is extremely busy. He doesn't want to speak to you. Go about your business. You can see for yourself, just use your eyes. - The man is very busy. - Lowe? What's the difficulty? I have a brother, sir. I'm leaving the ship in New York, and I was hoping he could travel with me. We are trying to make a new life in America. What do you mean "travel with you"? I've heard you are missing a steward. My brother is a steward. Are we missing anyone? LOWE: We are short of a steward, as it happens. Tom Richards, in the first-class dining room. Though I can't think how he knew. You don't want to be shorthanded, sir. Not in first class. LOWE: But he's Italian, sir. All the Italian waiters are in Mr. Gatti's a la carte restaurant. Those in first class are English and Irish. But it's not a law. If Richards turns up with a good story, your brother disembarks. - Of course, sir. - LIGHTOLLER: All right. If the uniform fits, the job's his. - What's his name? - Paolo Sandrini, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Paolo! Thank you, sir. LIGHTOLLER: Yes, yes. Now, get aboard. On this ship, they'd prefer the boilers to be understaffed than the first-class dining room. (Indistinct conversations) (Giggling) LIGHTOLLER: Who's he, do you think? He looks like the wandering prophet. Peter Lubov? Take the next gangway. This is for second class. Sorry, excuse me. Permisso. Sorry. (Silverware clattering) I would like to see the tickets, sir. I had them just a moment ago. Oh, come on. Let's leave them to it. Come on. HART: Sir. Just give me a minute, sir. I'm thirsty, Ma. Just wait one minute, darling, and we'll go and look for a drink. But I'm thirsty now. I'll take her. Come on. Excuse me. Dad, I don't like it. You don't like what? I just don't like it. There's too much water underneath. Theresa darling, I'd be worried if there wasn't enough, all right? Now, let's find you a bottle of pop. There we go. PAOLO: Is this your first trip to New York? Oh, no. I've worked the White Star Line for quite a while. And you've never been tempted to stay there? Is that your plan? To live in America? Put it this way... I'll never drink out of a glass like this if I stay in Europe. (Laughs) And everyone in America eats off porcelain and drinks from crystal? At least there's a chance that they might. MAN: Sandrini? May I inquire why you are half-dressed? His uniform wasn't properly fitted, and he wanted it right before a passenger saw him. Thank you. I'd better be off. Will I see you later? Maybe. When we've finished serving dinner, I'll be in the servants' dining room. Unless I'm not. (Chuckles) I don't know your name. If I have to come looking for you tonight, I have to know who I'm looking for. Well, I won't have gone far. Not on a ship. Annie. Annie Desmond. Paolo Sandrini. Will I see you later? My guess is you won't see anyone ever if you don't get back to work. Do you think we should have stayed and tried to change things? I have done enough of all that. So you've given up? And I don't care who knows it. Let the downtrodden cringe from the lash of their masters. I'm off to the New World, and I won't be back. - Cheers. (Rattling) LUBOV: You dropped this. Aren't you gonna thank him? Thank you. This is Peter Lubov. This is my wife, Mary. Mrs. Maloney. Well... JIM: That's not like you. What's the matter? Nothing. Sorry. Sorry. I couldn't make it. I had another run-in with the chief. He made me tidy every cupboard on the ship. What caused the run-in? Something and nothing. Oh. Well, I was here as I said I would be, and now I must go. But it's early. You have time for a walk. It's not early, and I've no time for anything. PAOLO: Where are you going? To settle my ladies in second class. Can't they manage without you? I hope not. If they could, I'd be out of a job. Can I come with you? What? Into their cabins? PAOLO: No. But I can walk you there. Along the boat deck, maybe. And how would the boat deck lead to second class? By a rather circuitous route. (Indistinct conversations) Traveling alone? And if I am? Just making conversation. David Evans. I'm on my own, too. He travels fastest, travels alone, eh? We seem to be going at the same speed as everyone else. (Chuckles) What's your line? This and that. EVANS: I was an army man. Scots Guards. Till I stopped a bullet and they kissed me goodbye. But I'd a packet of leaving pay, so I'm not complaining. Why were you looking at me? Was I? You seem familiar. That's all. Well, I'm not familiar. Not to you. I must get on. I should not be in first class, anyway. You're a bad influence. You can't come with me. I can try. BESSIE: It's time to go in. Don't you think we've had enough of a stroll for one night? I'm attempting to walk her into submission. Would you like some help, madam? I'm fine, thank you. It's getting cold. We ought to go inside. Can I come through? Not without an officer's permission, miss. I need to get into second class. Well, then, you shouldn't be in first class, should you, miss? Please. I'll be late. You ought to have thought of that before, miss. PAOLO: Hey. First class, second class. What about your own class? Have you no loyalty, man? Just this once. Don't try this again. Would you like me to turn down the bed, madam? MURIEL: Come in. She didn't mean to be unfriendly. You saw how she looked at us when he invited us to tea. She couldn't have been more shocked if we'd spat in her face. (Clears throat) MURIEL: Could you help me with this? You exaggerate. MURIEL I do not. And why, in the name of God, did you agree to attend an Anglican service? "Of course, Lord Manton. My pleasure, Lord Manton." I thought it'd be interesting. MURIEL: And the necklace. The clasp is a bit stiff. You have to squeeze it. Thank you. Who does she think she is? JOHN: She thinks she's a countess. And she's right. (Chuckles) Would you like me to turn down the bed, madam? WOMAN: Yes, please. Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus in Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. - Amen. - ALL: Amen. (Indistinct conversations) I think I might stretch my legs up on deck. LUBOV: Not me. I'm off for another dose of religion. Anglican, this time. JIM: Why? Because it's in first class. I'm curious. Aren't you? JIM: I wired this ship, remember. I know every nook and cranny. But don't let me spoil your adventure. That's it. I'm always ready for a new adventure. What did he want? He was saying he's going up to the Anglican service, although he doesn't strike me as a churchgoer. People are full of surprises. He says he wants to take a look. I might go, too. What for? It's a chance to see first class. The Lord will smite you. I don't think God will damn me for a little curiosity. Suppose he turns out to be the God of the Old Testament? I'll have to risk it. Well, go on, then. Right, you're all coming with Daddy. (Indistinct conversations) Don't be frightened by the strength of your feelings. What are you doing? I've only got two tonight. Why? The Wideners are giving a dinner party for the captain in Gatti's restaurant. They've asked the English lord and his family, the Astore, the Gordons, and the actress. So there's only the Rushtons left. Makes you wonder what they've done wrong. Should I push them together instead of spreading them apart? I shouldn't ask that question in a crowded bar. (Chuckles) (Sighs) Oh, I'd love to work in here. All the gentlemen so smart. Ladies in their fine dresses and sparkling tiaras. Do you ever ask yourself why they have so much and you have so little? I don't think I've got so little. I don't believe in envy. It eats you up from the inside. Besides, wherever you go, there's always haves and have-nots. Maybe. But I can name a place where it's easier to cross from one group to the other. America. So they say. In America, a man can go all the way, right to the top, if he's not afraid of hard work. What about a woman? I'm not afraid of hard work. Can't I go to the top? What about a couple? Both ready to take a chance on a new life? What couldn't they achieve? Is that your dream? I've got a lot of dreams... ...but maybe that's the heart of them. WATSON: Excuse me? I was wondering if you could help me. I was told this was the way to third class, but the door seems to be locked. Well, that's 'cause it is locked. The... The clasp on Lady Manton's jewel case is jammed. I thought there might be somebody in steerage who could mend it. I'm sorry. You can't go into third. Call your steward. He'll sort it. I didn't want her ladyship to find out. She'll think it's my fault. Bit of a tartar, is she? You know what they're like. I certainly do. I'll pay whoever mends it. Well, all right. But if I get into trouble, I'm blaming you. (Keys rattling) Paolo? (Indistinct conversations) Is there a locksmith here? The lady has a job for one. It's just the lock of a small case. I'd be so grateful. I'll look at it if you like. Thank you. I thought you could use this. And you'll need some light. I can see well enough. WATSON: No, no, you can't. Take it over there. To the light in the corner. I can't find anything wrong with it. The key turns easily. How strange. It was... It was jammed before. I've got six pence here, somewhere. Keep your six pence. What are you doing here? I saw you come down. I would have got down here sooner, but the sailor wouldn't let me pass. What was that about? WATSON: Meaning? There was nothing wrong with that case when you took it out of the purser's office. Have you been spying on me? Look, what's the matter? I don't know what you're talking about. If you're in trouble, I'll try to help, but I can't do anything if you won't tell me what it is. Hey, come on. (crying) Come on. It can't be as bad as all that. It is. It's worse. I told you my dad was poorly, but he's more than that. And without his wage, there's no money for medicine, there's no money for food, there's no money to live. What have you done? I took a brooch. (crying) It were only a little one. She hardly wears it. She won't miss it. When I think of how many times you've told me off for having no standards. Hey. HEY... Ah. You found her, then. Yes. Thank you. She, uh, she doesn't look too clever. Uh, Miss Watson's just having a bout of seasickness. LIGHTOLLER: Well, then she has my sympathy. It'll pass. I still don't understand what you're doing down here. I wanted a man to take the case somewhere out of sight. I gave him a piece of wire so they could see him trying to work it. I thought then I could blame him for the loss when her ladyship noticed it were missing. You'd let an innocent man go to prison? Of course not. But they won't know it's gone till we're back in London and it'll be too late to arrest anyone. No, no, no, no, no. You cannot be sure of either part of that. Where is it now? It's in my suitcase, in the hold. "Not Wanted on Voyage." Oh. What? I thought if her ladyship did notice, they'd search my cabin and it wouldn't be found. So suspicion falls on that poor fellow and one of you goes to jail. (crying) - No! - Come on, calm down. Hey. It's all right. It's all right. Now, here's what we'll do. You're going to dress her ladyship for dinner. And then... And then, while they're eating, we'll go down to the hold, we'll fetch the bally thing, and you can put it in with the other jewels when you take the case back to the purser. No, no. She'll wonder why I've got the case out at all. I normally only bring what she's going to wear on a jewelry roll. Then give it back to the purser now and slip the brooch into the roll with the rest. She'll never notice. Come on. Can I interrupt? Yes, do. My diners finished early. Two of my servants missed theirs, and I don't like to send them to bed hungry. I will find you something in a minute. So, did they all go up to Signor Gatti's restaurant? Yeah. All except the Rushtons, which Mrs. Rushton did not like. God knows what it cost Mr. Widener. Why pay money when you can eat in first class for free? No answer to give you. Why did they miss their supper? I don't know. Doing something for their employers, I suppose. Go on with what you were saying earlier. What was I saying earlier? About your dreams. What about your dreams? I don't think I have dreams. Not like yours. Mainly, I wait to see what happens and try to make the best of it. I believe in making things happen. Well, so do I, of course. When you've got chance to. Then... Will you marry me? (Chuckles) Hadn't you better finish clearing the table first? I'm serious. (Laughing) No, you're not. But I am. I know we are right for each other. At least, I know you're right for me. Mr. Sandrini, we have only just met. Some things you know. Well, I'm sure that makes sense in Italy, but I'm from London, me, and we're a little less impulsive. Won't you take a chance? Couldn't we just get to know each other first? Like normal people. No. Because if we part when we get to New York, if you go back to England, we'll never meet again. MY eye. Is your whole life so dramatic? Take a chance on me, please. You won't regret it. I promise. I must get back. Has your husband got a job to go to when you get there? We'll be all right. Jim'll always find something. You sound more hopeful than he does. Not really. He talks gloomy, but he always expects to land on his feet. I sometimes think I'm the other way around. So he's a pessimistic optimist, and you're an optimistic pessimist. Maybe. If you like. How about you? I only want to get away from Europe. I've no plans beyond that. Was Europe so bad? For me. But that's over now. Europe made me angry, and I don't want to be angry any more. I sometimes wish I'd been angrier. There's a part of me that envies your fight. Even if it was bloody, even if people died. I don't mean I haven't been happy, because I have. But I suppose I've never put myself in danger for something I believed. Perhaps you're in danger now. Perhaps I am. I thought you hated me. No, you didn't. You knew exactly how I felt from the moment I saw you. Jim! Jim, for God's sake, stop that now! Aren't you going to fight back? No. You coward! - Did he hurt you? - Of course not. There's no "of course" about it. Jim, for God's sake. He was drunk, and he stole a kiss. You're the one who put us into steerage. What did you expect? What's the matter? Why have the engines stopped? (Hissing) - What's that? Sounds like steam escaping. (Hissing) Jim? What's that? Stay!... I'll go and see. You're all right. Go back to sleep. It's all right, girls. Lie down. Go back to sleep. It's all right. Quick as you can! Let's get these boilers shut down before they blow! (Alarm ringing) Get out! Go! Get in! Go! Go! Sandrini, go! Go! (Shouting) Quickly! Sandrini! Go! Billy, I don't think we're going to get out of this. We may as well make use of the time we've got, then. Come on. (Indistinct conversations) What should I do, sir? Get as many as you can of the second-class women and children up on deck. And for heaven's sake, make them wear their lifebelts. Sir? She is going down, then? Looks like it. Right, sir. And put on your own. Just put it on. Annie! How can it hurt? Annie! They won't wear them. I have to get my jewels! Your jewels are gone. Just put this on and go up to the deck. No! No, I must get the jewels! There's no point in this. Let's get to the boats. Put it on and go to the boat deck. Make your way to the second-class boat deck. Put it on and go to the boat deck. Madam, put your life jacket on. Annie! Sir, please put your life jacket on. Can we not go up? Not yet. All in good time. When will be a good time because I'm not gonna keep 'em down here for much longer. Don't worry. There's no danger. Are you sure? This is Titanic. She's safer than dry land. What about the children? Couldn't you just take them? Couldn't we? What? And be followed by a pack of screaming mothers? As if. The children will be taken care of. Don't you worry about that. MARY: They'll be a boat along to take us off in the shake of a lamb's tail. They're only waiting for it to arrive. Could you see anything? Not much. They're getting the boats out. They say there's no danger. They're lying... Stay calm. We could charge them. MAN: Come along, ladies. Take my hand. Watch your step. Madam. Come on, Francatelli. Get in. But it looks so unsafe, my lady. Don't be a fool, Francatelli. This boat isn't sinking. That one is. We don't have much time. Come along. There must be more women. Well, there are no women here, so let some men get in. Cosmo! Mr. Lightoller was very clear. Women and children only. But if there aren't any... Well, I'm getting in if no one else is. Come on, chaps. If they're going, so are we. Wait a moment. You need someone to crew that thing. Right, then. Lower away. You can't lower it with so few people! There's room for far more! Officer, please give the order to lower the boat! At least take her. No, no, I can't leave yet. Not yet. Well, there you are, then. We tried. Lower the boat! Lower away. MAN: Right. Lower away. Steady. (Shouting) What on earth is going on here? Who are they? Waiters from Gatti's restaurant. Of course. Exactly what I was afraid of. Well, we can't allow this sort of racket to go. I'm not sure what we can do, sir. Maybe not, but we'll have to do something. Quiet! I'm not having this lot running riot all over the ship, screaming and shouting and upsetting the ladies. (Speaking Italian) This boat is gone. Go the other way. The other way. This boat is gone. HUGH: But it's not even half full. Stop! LADY DUFF GORDON: What can we do? We can't bring it back, my lord. Lower away. (Shouting) That's enough! Stand back! Keep back! Let my wife and children through. Stand back! Hey, hey. What's that? I said... stand back. Mary, go! - Go! Go now! - Go! Go! Go! Go! JIM: Go, children! Mary! Sean! (Keys jingling) This way. Is there another way out? Follow me. Where will this take us? I know who you are. It's come to me. What the hell does that matter? I was at the Siege of Sidney Street. They gave out wanted posters. You're Peter Piatkow, aren't you? Peter the Painter. You're crazy. No, no, no. I'm not crazy. It's been preying on me since we left Southampton. Peter the Policemen Killer. How many was it you murdered, eh? Four? Five? Half a dozen? We are on a sinking ship. We have other things to worry about. Oh, no. Don't think I'll let it go, because I won't. I can't. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure you are. (Cracking) BESSIE: I can't find my baby boy. I know his nurse has him safe somewhere, but I can't find him. But where can he be? I'd better go with him. We have to keep looking. MAN: Come on, miss. I hope you find him. Come on. Officer coming through. Excuse me. Please keep order. Thank you. (Shouting) What happened to the Italians? Safely under lock and key, sir. Was that really necessary? Best that way, sir. Then don't forget to let them out. What's the point of keeping them down here? It's company policy. Move on. No! There are women here! And children! They'll be allowed up in good time! Let them go up now, for pity's sake! Let them take their chances like everyone else! - Go away. - MAN: Listen to him! By what right are you holding us here! Let us pass! Come with me. They're losing control. We can get through. Why would I come with you? There's no time for that now. Come, and we can see her and the children safely aboard boat. Then we can fight to the death. If that's a promise... Yes! Don't wait for them to let you go! Don't stay here! Don't stay here to drown! No! No! (Shouting) Get the gate! Close the gate! (Indistinct conversations) But they can't be loading third class from here, before all the first class have gone? Mama, what difference does that make now? Please let my children pass! Aah! Pa, help her! Get the children onto the boat! HUGH: Give me your hand! Get your hands off her! No! He's helping! He's helping! Get your children. Up you come. Come on, children. Let's go, children. Come on. Let these children through! - That's enough. - Let them through! We're full! We're going to lower! You will not! Now let them through. Come on, children. Through the window. That's right. Get them on. Here we are. Get them on. MURDOCH: Hart! Hart! Get in there and take charge! Yes, sir. Come on. Stand back. Let me to talk to my wife. It'll break! The boat's going to break! Therese! Therese! We can't leave without my child! Stay with the others! I'll find her. Don't worry. Theresa! I said this would happen. I knew it would happen! They can't be gone. Hey! Where I can find a boat? The lifeboats have gone, but they've lowered a collapsible from a davit at the far end and they're trying to launch one more. If they manage, that'll be the last. Come on. Mrs. Allison, come with us. They're a boat loading at the far end. We'll be there. Just as soon as we find our baby. Can I take the child? Please? Please let me. Don't worry. We'll be there. It ain't gonna wait for us. Come on! Annie, come on! MAN: Children to the front, please. Allow them through. You next. Lady Manton! No, I'm not going. Get in. The women need you. You heard him. Get in. Make it easier for me. Please, please. No time for this. Come on, up. Take my hand. That's it. Any more ladies? I never kissed you. Kiss me in New York. LYONS: We need a man to crew it, sir. A stoker, but I know how to steer. Did Mario Sandrini get out? Have you seen him? He got out of the boiler room. But I heard they locked him away with the other Italians. PAOLO: What? JOHN: They're lowering a boat. Is that boat full? They're lowering it. We're too late. Hey! Do you know where they put the Italians? The ones they locked up? Why? Are you anxious to join them? Where are they? Where are they? Round that corner, last door at the end. But you won't get them out! The door's locked and it'll stay locked until it hits the ocean bed! Mario! Mario! Paolo! Paolo! Mario! Mario! No! Mario! Help! Help!
