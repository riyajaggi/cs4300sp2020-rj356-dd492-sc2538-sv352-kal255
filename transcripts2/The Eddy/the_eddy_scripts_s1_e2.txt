 You know, I could just come and work at the club if you need me. 'Course you could. Do you? Have a good day. Bye, Dad. Good morning. Hurry, please. Some of our new students choose to wear a name tag, so everyone gets to know them quickly, but it's an optional thing. OK. I'll opt out, please. Ah. OK. Um... I have papers for you, your schedule, and... a brochure. Hi.

 Hello. - Oh, you're American? - Yeah. I'm Beatrice. Welcome. This school's an island of mediocrity in the greatest city on earth. Want someone to show you around? No. OK. Then I guess I'll see you. Eighteen... twenty-one... and died in 1867. So, Charles Baudelaire, if you'd please write this down... When we talk about the spleen today, we're talking about the fact that beauty doesn't last. Beautiful things are fragile, sensitive, and somehow tend towards death. Tell me what we have here. We have to put the same elements all together. - F with F... - And the G with the G. Yeah, that's right. The derivate of F multiplied by G... can be defined as... Yeah? The limits when H reaches zero, of F, G of X plus H. - Hi, Mom. - Hello. - How are you? - I'm great. How are you doing? I'm good. And school? Yeah. We're learning about Baudelaire. And we're running around in our little ties, with all of our hopes and dreams and aspirations. It's fantastic. And you're making friends? Yeah. Uh... I ate lunch with this girl, Beatrice. This Irish girl. How's Elliot? I mean, you know, after Farid? Elliot is doing fine. Because, you know, I don't want what happened in New York to repeat itself. OK? Mom, one day I'm gonna have you write down what you think happened in New York and then I'm gonna write down my own account, and then we'll compare and contrast the fucking two and see that there's absolutely no fucking similarity. Don't you curse, young lady. Not to me. You understand? No cursing. Cursing is not the problem, Mom. Why am I echoing? Am I in a bathroom? - Julie. - Yeah? - You're on a toilet aren't you? - No. Why would you think that? Oh, I know you're on the toilet. Tell me. I have to go, Mom.

You just need to calm down, man. Can you hear? We're playing good. No, y'all are playing what y'all want to play. We should keep it the way it is. We're always transposing, like we're machines. Sim. What do you think? Me? What do you think? - It's good. They're great. - Thanks. But... It's maybe a little banal. What do you know? Aren't you here to take drink orders? Try it again.

You're very aggressive. I know that... - Something happened. We know. - Something happened? Yeah. Maya, please, this has nothing to do with that. It has to do with me sitting back there, suffering, because you will not sing the song that I wrote! I understand, yeah. "Been zendazeen" to you too. Maja... What is the problem? - What is the problem? - You are my problem! - I'm your problem? - Yes! - I'm the problem? - Yes! My problem is that you don't know the words, won't sing the words... You won't even try. You say you want to be great, but you pull this bullshit. That's what I'm talking about. We got to get it together. You play like... Where you going? I'm leaving. - Where you going, man? - Calm down, calm down... Come on, Jude. He will go to her. What's funny? What are you laughing at? Is this a game? - Sorry. - This is not a fucking game. We do not have the time to waste on jokes, man! And on games, and on this fucking bullshit. Where you going? - Kat! - Nobody's having fun. Music's supposed to be fun. Snap. I'm sorry, guys. Shit... You want to have fun, why don't you have fun somewhere else? It's not fun for me. All right? This is all I got. You understand? This is it. And y'all are bullshit! Every last one of you are bullshit. And you're better than that! She is, and all of you are. Sick of this shit. Should we get coffee or what? Coffee? Seriously? Always coffee. Well, then I'm leaving too. What do you think of that? Ciao! ♪ Kiss me in the morning ♪ ♪ And yet you always seem To get it right ♪ Good? Thank you, thank you... You never saw that. Hello. Hello. We said we'd swing by at 11... Remember? Ah! Yes, of course. Do you have any news? We're making progress... But I need to take a look at your books. What are you looking for exactly? Pay slips, list of suppliers... All your paperwork, essentially. Who handled the books? Mr. Youssfi or you? Farid. Normally... I just write music. Is that everything? That's everything. Was it as bad as you thought, school? Yes. Did you make any friends? Uh... Let's just not talk about it. How tired are you? Pretty fucking wiped. Hey. Hi. No, I'm with Adam right now. I can't... I'm sorry. I know, I know. I'm sorry. But... - we have to talk. - Yes. But I can't now. I'm with my son. I know. I know. But... Look, Julie... Julie can look after Adam. I'm house trained. Mostly. Please. OK, then. Thank you. That's all I know. And why do I have to know? You don't want to? No. Farid was involved in something, and I'm worried that they might try and do something to... - I can't tell the police. - You can't tell the police? No, I can't tell the police. If Farid was involved in something illegal, which I guess he was, they'll shut us down. No. I can't hear this. Not me. I can't. Amira, I'm scared. For me, for you, for Julie... I'm being followed. So call the police! Fuck that club. - There are people that... - Screw the club! There are people depending on that club. You don't care? - Yes. - People who Farid cared about. Farid? Where is Farid? All of this pity food! I remember when my brother died. So much fucking cake, I got fat. Just don't get fat because it doesn't help. Um... Yes! Cool. Chicken wings. You're gonna love 'em. It's gonna be awesome. Just gonna light this baby up. Perfect. And then I think you just, like... Yeah. That'll work. How you feel won't get better. But, you can choose to make it better. If you're not a fucking idiot, like me. Do you understand? Great! OK. It usually, like, takes a second. We just have to wait, I think. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Shit! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's fine. Excuse me. - It's nothing. It's OK. - I'm sorry. - What were you making? - Chicken with honey. So now you like honey? Go in the living room. Guys, stay focused. Take it easy! Go blue! Good job! Come on, guys! You need to play as a team. OK. So that's basically yesterday, right? In terms of history. So, what happened in 2018? Any idea? - Commemoration? - Mm-hmm. No, I talk about commemoration. Commemoration... Julie? For instance? - No. - No? You never read the news? Mm... sometimes. OK. You should, though. It's really important. In 2018, OK... The French government finally recognized the use of torture in Algeria. Hi. - How's it going? - Good, and you? Good. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? High school. Hence the uniform. I think I found my look, no? Fashion woman. - What's this? - For the job. OK. Sandwiches? Yep. I'm a Renaissance man. And you finish your school? Class? I. uh... I quit. - You quit? - Don't tell my dad. So, you help me? I work here. You come? I pay you with ice cream. - OK. - Let's go. Hurry up. - Hello. - Hello. Careful. There. Now for some music. Your phone? We need music. Faster, faster. OK. Thank you. OK, so... No, no... Oh! No. In your ear. Same music in my ear. And you will begin in three. One, two... Hello, everyone! Would you like a little sandwich, a coffee, some chips? No? Nothing at all? Have a nice day! Ma'am! Would you like a coffee or sandwich? No? Hello, people. You want some water? Or some... new water? No? Hello, people. Do you want some sandwich, chips... Candy, apples... I have everything you need. Hello! Hello, everyone! Would you like sandwiches? Coffee or chips? - You? What do you want? - We have a winner! A winner! A sandwich! - Chicken? - Chicken! We have a chicken winner! Five euro. I say, one, two, three, four, five! Who would like to be like this shining example of a man? Yeah? You want some sandwiches? Whoa! Hey, ma'am, it's your lucky day. Doritos to go with it. - See you later! - Goodbye! PLEASE CLOSE THE DOOR. THANK YOU. You're fucking slow! Shit... Hello. Nice day, huh? - My... stepfather? - Yeah. Stepfather, well done. I was not very popular with him. Or I was, but not in the way that you should be, with a man who's supposed to be your father. What do you mean? He wanted to fuck me. - He want to fuck you? - He wanted to fuck me. And so, I basically made the decision to get naked and get into his bed. Get naked? Why? I wanted to see what he was. I wanted him to show himself to me and show me what the fuck he actually was. And as a result, he told my mom... and basically made her choose between me and him. - And she chose him? - Yeah. And, uh... Yeah, it fucking sucked. I mean, I was in everybody's good books at the time. Everyone was so proud of me, for, like, being so brave because I'd had this problem... that I'd gotten over, you know? - "Problem..." - Drugs? - Yeah. - Mm. And everyone thought I was "so brave," and then I went and just... yeah, fucked it all up, essentially. - So what about you? - Hmm? What about your childhood? Spill. - Spill? - Spill. Tell me everything. - It's an English word? Spill? - Your childhood. - Spill! - Oh. OK. My childhood. Well... It's a French... normal childhood. You know? - My grandmother raised me. - Yeah. And she's really cool. Sometimes it was complicated. Bad moments. But... I'm lucky. I'm sorry you're not. So is selling sandwiches your dream job? Not a dream job, but... I just have to do it. For money, you know? You, your dad gives you money. Me? I give me my money. I have to eat. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm a... How do you say... ...asshole? No. It's OK. You're not too "asshole." - You're not beaucoup asshole. - Yeah, I am. - It's OK. - OK. Fuck! Rehearsal. Rehearsal! - Your what? - Rehearsal. - Rehearsal. - Rehearsal? - Yeah. - Oh, shit! So... - Can I come? - Um... no. - Please? - No. Please? - Hello. - Hello. Hey. This is Julie. Julie, my grandmother. - Nice to meet you. - You good? Sim. Very bad man. - No! - No, I know. I can't get rid of him. Can you take him off my hands, please? I... I told him... I like you. Thanks. If you say so. - Yeah. - So? Ready for marriage? No! Knock it off! She tell lies! Say no, please! Show him what we did earlier. I got a call from your school. What's wrong with the place? Nothing. It's fine. Some of the kids give you a hard time, or something? I'm not the sort of girl kids give a hard time to, Dad. Huh? What? I'm not the sort of girl kids give a hard time to, Dad. - Well, then what was it? - I don't need to go to school. OK, well unfortunately, you can't just decide not to go. Well, I did, so... Julie, come on. - Come on, what? - I don't need this right now. Oh, I'm sorry that, as always, I'm an inconvenience to you. - No, don't play that. - Don't play what, Dad? The self-pity thing? Don't play that? - What did you just say? - Nothing. Hey. You don't know what you're talking about. - Do I not? - No, you don't know. You lost one kid, then you didn't know how to deal with the other one, so you just cut her off. - If that's one act of fucking self-pity... - Watch your mouth! Don't tell me what the fuck to do. In this house you're not going to speak like that. I'm your father and you will not speak to me like that. - Oh, you're my father? - Yes, I am. I am your father and I loved you. You're talking in the past tense, you fucking dick. I love you. Hey. You hear me? I'm not going to any school and that's the fucking end of it. Thank you. Julie. I can't be here. I can't be here. I'm the boss's daughter. Right? So, I'm sort of the boss myself. Let's go. Come on. Ugh! Fuck. - You want some? - No, no. Is this yours? No. What is that? I don't want that thing. - It's yours. - I don't want it. - You play that? - No, I don't play it. Liar. - Are you hot? - Hmm? It's hot in here. You should take this off. OK. Your dad plays the clarinet? - Your dad? - Yes. He plays everything. Unfortunately. I play this. My brother plays better than I do, but... Touch me. You want to fuck me? Come on. I've done everything. I've done everything you could ever imagine. What? I want to feel you inside. It's gonna feel really fucking good, I promise. Do whatever you want to me... - Huh? - Do whatever you want to me. Come on. Jesus Christ! Is it that hard? - I want to feel normal. - Julie... I just want to feel normal. Please! - You've drunk too much. - Shut the fuck up, please. - This isn't normal. - Do you not like me? I like you. You don't want to fuck me? No. You're drunk.

If you fucking hurt her... Huh? Look, she came on to me. She told me I could do anything I wanted to her. - But… I told her no! - What the fuck are you talking about? That's the truth, I said no! OK? She left, she was offended. She left. That's the truth! - If you fucking hurt her... - If I hurt her? Me? I'm telling you the truth. Sim? Sim? You come here, act all tough. I'm not afraid of you, OK? It's nothing. Seriously, it's nothing. Don't worry. - How's it going? - Good. All good? - Who's she? - I have money. We just found her. She's high, she wants weed. Here. I don't want this. I want coke. What are you doing? Coke. - Snow. - Either take it or fuck off. - You taking it? Want it or not? - You don't have coke here? You talking to me? Take it or fuck off. Can I have my money back then, please? You talking to me? Take it or fuck off. - Give me my money! - What are you saying? If you're not going to give me coke, give me my fucking money back. - Let's go find Dez. - Go on. She's crazy. Sit down. - Give me my fucking money back. - Sit down, I said. Sit. Are you kidding? Are you kidding me? Fuck! She's not anywhere? You didn't see her? I've asked all over the place. Nothing. - Hey. Anything? - No. No one's here. - You're at the school? - Where do I try next? Go back to the club. I'll call you there. Fuck! Hey. I've lost her. I've lost Julie. What do you mean? She goes missing all the time. But she doesn't have her phone. She doesn't have anything. OK. Start from the beginning. I swear, if something's happened to her I don't know what I'm gonna do. Just tell me what happened. What's happening? You're not getting me coke, huh? That's a no. Can you just let me go? I don't want the money. Please? - Evening, sir. - Good evening. - Captain Keita, please. - Wait a second. Security measures. Why do you want to see Captain Keita? My daughter is missing. I need to speak with... - Captain Keita is not here, sir. - I understand. - It's 3:00 a.m. - She'll want to see this, OK? It's very important. Please, will you just call her? - Evening, Damien. - Hi. - Evening, Captain. Mr. Udo. - Good evening. Hey. My daughter is missing, and I think... I should have showed you this before, and I didn't. - These guys, they're Eastern European... - Take a seat. They're the guys that beat me up, the guys that I believe killed Farid, and I know that they've been following me and my daughter. The club apparently owed them money... - The club owed them money? - Yeah. I've been looking through these books and can't make heads or tails of it. You co-manage this club but you have no idea whatsoever... Listen to me... These guys, they know where my daughter is, all right? Please help me. I'm scared. Do you have a photo? Uh... Yeah. Send it to this number. OK. - Got it. - That's it? We'll look for her. OK. So, you didn't mention any of this because you were afraid of the consequences for the club? Yes, that's right. Or, another theory. You're involved. Excuse me? I don't understand. May I suggest a different answer than "I don't know anything"? - But I don't know anything. - Right. You were stealing money from the club. You borrowed from the wrong people. Mr. Youssfi found out. Listen to me. I didn't keep the books, OK? Now this loan, or whatever it was is Farid's... - He's the one that... - He's dead now. So you hired them. Right? - Or they were involved with you. - No. - What are you talking about? - We tracked your mobile. And when he was killed you were nowhere near Le Relais. In fact, you were near your club. - And you've been clearly in a fight. - I told you about the fight. And you hid evidence from me even though I warned you. I lied to you, right? To protect the club, not to protect myself. I just wanted to try and figure out what it was that Farid was up to. But listen to me, my daughter is missing. She is out there somewhere. And I know that these guys have something to do with it. So will you please just help me find her? Please. You need to stay here for a while. We're going to keep you for a while. Stay here for what? Where are you going? Excuse me. Excuse me. What are you going to do to help me find my daughter? - I'm doing it. - These guys had something to do with it. Hey, get off of me. Get the fuck off of me, man! Hey, where you going? Where you going? Hey, we're talking to you, answer us! Who are you? - Come on, let's go. - Are you with Dez? - Julie, let's go. - What are you doing here? - You with Dez? - Yeah, I'm with Dez. Come on. - Let's go. - Where's Dez? - Get out of my way. - Are you with Dez or not? Do you speak French? I told you, it's under control. Why you acting so tough? You got a problem? What are you gonna do? Huh? - Come on, Julie, let's go! - Want me to smash your face? - What? - Want me to smash your face? Come again? Say that again. - Julie. - What? Go. - Where's Dez? - Go on, get outta here. - We'll see you again anyway. - Fuck off. - I'll fuck your grandma. - Your breath stinks. I don't know why they thought they had to do that. American girl, asking for cocaine? You just scared them. - In New York I can go anywhere. - Whatever. You seem to be pretty fucking comfortable around here. What do you mean? You work with those kids. Right? Do you not? I mean, it's fine. Just, like... Don't act all holier-than-thou. "This neighborhood is so unsafe..." You think I'm a dealer? - What? - You think I deal? Yeah. It's fine. I mean, I use, so it's fine. Just, like, don't give me a fucking lecture about it. You know what? Go back to your dad now. OK? You're the same. You don't get it. What? You still don't get it? Look at you, you're fragile. - What? - You're weak! - You understand English. - What the fuck did you just say? - I'm weak? - Yeah. - Fragile? - Yeah. I'm not fucking weak. Don't you get what I just did? I called people. You understand that? I told them you'd disappeared. I went out there. I sent your picture to friends. I was ready to fight. Shit. Sorry. I knew you'd be in some shithole. Just because they look like me, does not mean I work here. Oh, my God! Are you calling me racist? That's not what I mean, it's... I don't need you. OK? I don't need you. Too much bullshit. Got it? I can't do it. OK? Here. Taxi. Dad? Dad? Dad, hey, it's Julie. I'm at home. I don't know where you are. As per usual. Um... So just let me know... where you are. I'm here. This is Julie. Your daughter. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
