 I miss school. I want to go back. - Do you miss school or Anaïs? - Tough question. You go back Monday, that's soon enough. You're awake too? What were you watching? Nothing. I was watching videos of Dad. Can I watch too? Come here. How would you feel about breakfast in bed? I mean, a real breakfast, not some little... A real one. With scrambled eggs, pancakes... The works. And we stay in bed. - There's all that? - Yeah. - Can we order anything we want? - Choux puffs! Wait, I'll go first. Choux puffs, hot chocolate, and apple juice as well, pain au chocolat, and I'll take three croissants. And five choux puffs. - You won't eat all that. What about you? - Look who's talking. - I'm not hungry. - I'll get you something. If you don't want it, give it to me. Always. You're always scrounging! Everything you can. That's him. That's him, right there. Can I please have my phone? I need to call my daughter. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Thank you. I... I need to call my daughter. Please? I had a man in here, accused of his wife's murder. He was swearing he was innocent, as you are. He had massive gambling debts. And he couldn't face his wife's judgment so he killed her. Your club has debts. Your club has big problems, and I think you were desperate. - No, I was not desperate. - Yes. And so you were angry with your friend. Farid was my closest friend in the whole world. - What I think... - In the world! Why would I ever do something like this? You think I'm afraid? Don't forget I'm the police. OK, so you listen to what I'm saying. I believe you left your club, you went to Le Relais de Belleville, you waited there till it was closed, you returned and confronted him, and then you lost control. - No? - You're wrong. Farid was my best friend. If he was your friend, why did you know nothing about him? Let's go get your things. Have a nice day, sir. Goodbye. Hey, you've reached Julie. I probably won't listen to this. Hey, Julie. I'm glad you're OK. I'm headed home. I'll see you soon. Mr. Udo? I forgot to tell you... The Cabaret Unit is shutting down your club. - Sorry? - Noise nuisance. It's been going on for a while, so... Here's the notice. - You're shutting us down? - It's not me, it's the Cabaret Unit. Different department. But it will work itself out. Have a nice day. We follow procedure! If he has no ID, we call the police! He could be an alien. You're handsome even when you're sulking. - Stop it, Mom. - It's true. I'm sure all the girls at school are in love with you. Don't say that. I hope you tell them you only have eyes for your mother. That's right. Or I'll get mad. What? Am I right? Is that a smile? Have some. Just a bit. - I'm not hungry. - Have some and I'll stop. Mom? Please tell me the truth. I'm lost. Tell me the truth about Dad. Hello? Yes. - Mom... - Speaking. Shush. Wait. I'm on my way. See you soon. Who was it? Mom? - Hey, Amira. - They're releasing the body. We will bury him today. I need you to organize which friends come. T-Today? I will text you the address. We have to bury Farid today. You OK? I tried to call you. I tried to call you. I hope you have a black dress. We're burying Farid today. Peace be upon you. Let me take that. - Aren't the children here? - Yes, they are. Adam? Inès? Is that you? Inès... You've become a young woman. Adam... - Hello, sweetheart. - Hello. You are so handsome. Say hello to your grandpa. Greetings, my son… Here. Put that over there. We've taken care of everything. Our imam will bury him. OK. The cemetery is sorted too. Good. We've arranged catering afterwards. At our home. As you wish. I want him buried quickly, that's all. Will his friends be there? Yes. It's what he would have wanted. Where is he? - Through there. - Come. Honey... Sweetheart... Your grandma is asking if you want to attend the ghusl. It will be tough to see him like that. - If you don't want to, it doesn't mean... - I want to be there. I'll be downstairs. Hello! Hello! Hey, green is sexy. All right? Wow! All right. Uh... I guess that's one way to do it. - Are they protesting? - I-I-I don't know what they're doing. That can't be comfortable. Not at all. Can I ask where you were? What you were doing? Um... I was just wandering around and then I got lost. Go on, son. Adam... Adam, if it's too hard, you can leave. No, it's OK. Come on, Adam, give me that. In the name of Allah the Merciful. Go on, son. Adam... In the name of God. You can talk to him, you know. Think about... about three memories that you have of him. They don't all need to be good memories. I don't care about your memories.

Pray for Allah the Almighty to have mercy on your brother, Farid. We ask you, Allah, to award him your contentment and a place in your heaven. Forgive his sins and have mercy on his soul. Spare him and guard him. I told you not to come. - I liked Farid. - Well, he didn't like you. - You're my baby sister, I love you. - I don't have a brother, fuck off. And Inès has grown. Stay away from my kids. And fuck off. He was human, like the rest of us. We are not angels. You will depart as you came into the world. Naked, with no belongings, no possessions.

Goodbye, Daddy. Thank you. Kind of you. Yup. I'm disappointed by the buffet. I expected more since they work for us. Don't worry, it's fine. Your brother's here. - I hope he behaves. - I asked him not to come. We need to talk about Adam. What about him? His future. - Meaning? - We could take him in. Find him a good school around here. You know what happens when you don't study. Farid never wanted you to look after the kids. I don't see why that would change. Hey. - You have a little... - What? Oh, wow. Look at that. Crazy. Take it. It's for the taxi. Come on, take it. OK. There you go. I messed up really bad and I'm really sorry. That's just the way you are. - This doesn't feel like Dad. - What? All this. It's not his style. I think your grandparents wanted this. This is bullshit. It's their style. You can do better by him. The club? Uh... - It's... It's been closed by the police. - What? Why didn't you tell us? Today wasn't the day. - You decide that? - Jude, stop. - Do you have your house keys? - Yes. In half an hour, take your mom home. Insist on it, OK? Shush. Our secret? Good. Inès could stay. No, we're all going home. And my tummy hurts. I'm not sure it's up to you. You're right, it's up to me, and we're going home. As a family. Anyway, thanks for everything. I think it was a beautiful way to remember him. Yeah. - Hello. - Hello. - You're such a bad actor! - So bad. - That was so lame. - "Oh, my tummy hurts!" - It was lame, right? - Yeah, totally. Your grandma won't forgive you. Well, I'm hungry. Shall we order pizza? Huh? What do you say? You assholes! How are you? Good? - It's nice, yeah? - This was your idea? My grandfather was a chess player. At his funeral everyone set up chess boards and played. It was beautiful. He was an alcoholic too, but that's another story. Thank you. Your dad, he will never be good at what you need him to be good at. So if you need me, I'm here. ♪ Hey! Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! Hey! ♪ ♪ Hey! Hey! ♪ - ♪ For Farid!

Are you going to say a few words? Do you want me to? Of course I do. Elliot, we have our differences, but you and Farid were important to each other. So, it's important you say something today. I know. I'll try. You have no choice. You haven't left yet? What are you doing here? - For the kids, maybe you should... - Since when do you care? - Dad would have wanted me here. - Dad would be ashamed of you! Fuck off. Fuck off! Don't come back here. This is my home. Hey! Hey! What the fuck is this? If you hurt my daughter... Hey, hey! You got a picture of my daughter? What's wrong with you, man? If you hurt her, I'll kill you. Hear me? I just wanted you to come. Calm down! I just wanted you to come. I don't have interest for your fucking daughter, OK? Because of you, police think I killed Farid. - What? - You make picture of me. What is this? I don't kill. I make money. - What are you talking about? - Chemical dye paint. I make money. Counterfeiter. And you make trouble. - Counterfeiter? - But I have solution. Now listen to me. You see this man? Ukrainian, close enough. You tell the police you see this man. Wait, wait. - You want me to tell the police... - Elliot walk down street... See the man who killed Farid. This man. See killer. Where? Seventeenth. Rue Saint-Ouen. Do this. - After all over, Zivko, no more. - And what about this guy? Huh? - What about him? - Happy. No problem. Paid. Go. She go in good school. Super nice. Private school. I like it. Go. Farid, you were proud. And a bit of an ass. Music was your life. It was... It was visceral. It was vital. You meant... everything to him. Your music was... It was a pain in my ass. It annoyed me because it was... and still is, too irritating, too snobby, too... I mean, it's no Céline Dion. You can say that again. If you diss Céline, get out of my house! And... let's not forget that when he founded The Eddy with Elliot, well, he wasn't here, I had no husband. Um... But he was happy. He said it was great. That it would change his life. I gently reminded him that he had a wife and two beautiful kids. But you were his biggest achievement. I'm telling you. And eventually... I was won over because... because I started to enjoy your music. I ended up loving your music because... I understood that... that it had saved him. So, let's play for him. And let's keep remembering him... with a smile.

Farid always used to tell me to work on my French. Because one day... I would really need it. Well, that day has come. And I'm... I'm still not prepared. So, in English... Here's what you need to know about Farid. When we were younger men... Not so long ago... Thank you, thank you! We decided after a big night out, on a bit of a whim, that we were gonna go to Marrakesh. Did he tell you this? And, uh... After a series of, uh, missed flights and missed connections, we somehow found ourselves in Dusseldorf. For those of you know don't know, Dusseldorf is not in Morocco. And it is not a particularly happening city, if you know what I mean. But, uh... I was exhausted, of course, and more than a little bit pissed off, and... Farid looked at me and with a straight face he said to me, "E, why don't we start off with the Koutoubia Mosque, and then maybe finish up at the Sultan's Palace? Sound good? I said, "How am I going to tell Amira that her husband has completely lost his mind?" But off we went. And we found ourselves visiting these horrible, horrible malls, and pretending that we were in spice markets. Eating this terrible German sausage, and, uh... He said, "Oh, E, this is a local delicacy." We spent two days in that cold, cold German city and not once, not one time, did he admit that we were completely lost. Adam... I want you to know, your daddy had a way of making everything magic. He never met a stranger. And even when things didn't go his way, he... He could somehow just... turn it around and make it OK. I lost my son a few years ago. And I was lost. Still am lost. Brother... I love you dearly. I'm going to miss you so much. Thank you all. Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. Good speech. Thanks. You know something pretty cool you used to say to me, right after Fred died? What's that? "Joy comes in the morning." You remember that? - Is something going on? - Hmm? Are you OK? You left, earlier. Oh. Just a business matter, that's all. Hmm. Business. They left? The singer asked everyone to leave to give you some space. But you stayed? I stayed for the kids. Where's Inès? Playing in the garden, having fun. And Adam? I don't know, he's in his room with the door closed, so... video games, porn, I have no idea. Funny. Didn't I ask you to leave? Why are you still here? Why do you talk to me like that? Huh? What did I do to you? You went off to live your life. I stayed. You stayed because you had nowhere to go. You were a bum. I took care of our parents. And now they're dead. - And you've been ignoring me since? - Yeah. I get it, but... now you need me. You have no one left. What, I need a man? No, no. But you need someone to help you with the kids and everything. Think about it. You're all alone. Trust me. For once, just trust me. And why would I trust you? Huh? "Why would I trust you? Huh?" - Cut it out. - Cut it out. Hello. POLICE - Evening, Captain. - Evening. Mr. Udo. Mr. Udo... - Please. - Thanks. What brings you here? - Um, I have something to say. - OK. Right... So, the man who did it... Who I believe did it... I saw him today. - You saw the man? - Yeah. - Yeah. Today. And, uh... Yeah. - Today? Where? Avenue de Saint-Ouen. Seventeenth. OK. - Should I reopen the report? - Yeah, go for it. There. - That one. - OK. - OK. - And could you identify him again? Hmm? - Could you identify him again? - Ah, yes. Of course. OK. - This doesn't mean your club is reopened. - Yes, I know. Yeah. How lucky! Hmm? You go out, you walk the street and, boom, you see the man. What? You think I'm lying to you? Well, it would be a very bad idea to do so. Of course. Today, I was walking down the street in the 17th. Avenue de Saint-Ouen. It was the day of my best friend's funeral. And I saw the man that killed him. ♪ In all this time I know I do complain ♪ ♪ At everything that I'm Finally understanding ♪ ♪ Just what we had Want it so bad ♪ ♪ I want to be part of your dream ♪ ♪ I didn't know That all the days were numbered ♪ ♪ I let it go And on and on I stumbled ♪ ♪ Don't run away What will it take? ♪ ♪ All I can do Is reach out to you ♪ ♪ And not a day goes by ♪ ♪ That you're not crossing my mind ♪ ♪ I try to follow you ♪ ♪ But all I do is get lost And fall further behind ♪ ♪ And not a day goes by ♪ ♪ That you're not crossing my mind ♪ ♪ I try to follow you ♪ ♪ But all I do is get lost And fall further behind ♪ ♪ And not a day goes by ♪ ♪ That you're not crossing my mind ♪ ♪ I try to follow you ♪ ♪ But all I do is get lost And fall further behind ♪ Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
