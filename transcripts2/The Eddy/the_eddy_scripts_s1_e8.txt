You haven't done it yet. We need that. Maja. Please hit the F at the end of the second verse. Don't miss it. Otherwise... Otherwise, y'all sound pretty damn good. I think you're ready for tonight. Yeah, yeah! Elliot, we're ready. Are you? You owe me an ice cream. No, no. You say you want a pain au chocolat. I never said that. I said I wanted an ice cream. You forgot about our agreement. No, you say that with your American sexy accent, you know? No, I didn't! I said "ice cream." Julie, not so loud. One second! OK, I really need to see you today, to protect me from my mom and my step-dad who are visiting me. What? I'm going to meet your mom? Maybe. If I ever see you. Julie! I have to work today. - So, you can't see her? - Yeah, I can't. OK, I'll tell her. Bye. He can't. Julie, I worked all night and when I come home, all I hear is "blah, blah, blah". I'm sorry. - Your mom is coming today? - Yeah. And your dad is playing tonight. Do you want a coffee? I can make you one. - I doubt it. - Let me see. I'm sorry about the noise, sometimes I just, like, get excited and then I forget about decibel levels and... Julie. Julie, it's OK. - I think I got it. - No, no. It's fine. This will be faster. Orange juice. All right. Fuck this. Adam is not too happy on the sofa. Oh. - You are welcome here, but... - But you need me to go? It's OK. I get it. You guys are going through a lot. No, are you crazy? No! No, I just think it's... sofa time, for you. It's OK? Yeah, it's fine! - What? - I thought you were gonna kick me out. OK. - A lot of people have done that? - Mm-hmm. Well, not me. OK? This is your home. You stay as long as you like. But... - Respect... - Respect your rules? Respect your rules. Respect your rules. Got it. I really appreciate it. You are a tough-ass bitch. - It's a compliment, yes? - Mm-hmm. OK. Thank you. You're welcome. Hi, how's it going? Come in. No, I'd rather talk to you outside. - Plus, the cigarette. - OK. Julie, you're babysitting Adam. - Adam, keep an eye on Julie. - Sure! You scored with the Astérix Park trip. They won't stop talking about Uncle Paplar. Cool. - Otherwise they're OK? - They're OK. During the day, they're fine. The nights are harder. Inès is wetting the bed again. What about you? Are you OK? No. No. No, I'm not OK. I don't do shit. I feel alone. I resent him for not being here. And the club? How's business? Since when do you care about the club? - I don't know. I've heard talk. - Meaning? Zivko's death is a problem. You know, Farid owed a lot of people money. With Zivko gone, there's a gap. Why are you looking at me like that? I'm doing this to protect you. I don't want something bad to happen. Something bad? - I don't know, they're... - Who's "they"? You mean Sami? Sami? I don't know who that is. I don't know if that's why he came or if... He kept telling me to watch out. To watch out for myself, to watch out for my kids. He seemed sincere. My brother has always lied to me. Always. - Since we were kids. - But? But I don’t think he's lying about this. - What are they talking about? - Her brother came this morning. - What did they talk about then? - I don't know. Couldn't hear. Hey. Maja, you want to join us? Hey, just... Just one minute. He came over and started talking, he talked about the money. - You think this is connected to Sami? - I asked him. - He said he didn't know him. - And you believe him? I have no idea! I don't know. I don't know anything. Listen, Amira... I think your brother's a front for somebody else. We need to figure out who. How? He's your brother. OK. - You'd forgotten. - No, Franck, I didn't forget. - I just got a thing I gotta do. - Just go through it once. You promised. - At least give us a level. - Once. Thank you. Dad? Dad, we have to go. What are you doing? Elliot, what the fuck? What are you doing? - Franck, I'm sorry. I'll be back. - You promised. Come on, just five minutes. Tonight. Elliot. Elliot! I've got press coming tonight for the live recording. Don't let me down. Come on. I won't, Franck. Sure? You haven't even told me what you're gonna play. Your comeback song. It's not a comeback song, Franck. It's a one-off performance, and you'll find out when everybody else does. Elliot. You can still play, right? If it's stage fright, just tell me, it's fine. I can still play. What's that? Just some lyrics. For tonight? Uh... Possibly. Cutting it close. - Thank you for the support, Julie. - You're welcome. There they are. First class is not what it used to be! There was a man on the plane wearing a bathrobe. Well, thank God you put me in coach. Oh, well I was too angry for my own good. Hi. - Haven't we done that? - No. Oh, my God. Hi. And this is really nice. Thanks. - Hello, Elliot. - Hey, Allison. Scott. Elliot. Julie. Well, I'm starving. The food on the plane was shit. Let's go to lunch. Hello! - Are we meeting there? - Yeah, unless you want to ride with me. - I'll meet you there. - Cool. PARIS LOVES YOU Here. - You think this is some fucking joke? - No, it's all you left me. You think I buy that? Here, take it, and get the fuck out. - Nothing changes around here. - When were you last here? No, nothing changes. Hey, you wanna come by? - You've kept everything. - Well, yeah. Even the wallpaper. I like it. It's original. They don't make it anymore. Yeah... Is that what your friends say? That it's original? Nobody comes here. What have you done with my room? You're a musician now? I got it cheap. Meaning you stole it. Do you use it at least? I wanted to, but I never have the time, so... Why did you come here? Because Elliot thinks you're lying to me. - Elliot? That asshole? - Watch it. Farid thought so too. And don't tell me, I know he thought the same of me. He says it's Sami. Everything. Sami? It's not big enough for him. So now you know him? - I... - You work for him? I'm just trying to do what's best for you. No. No, I'm an idiot. You're a buffoon. You don't work for him. But you made him believe you could work with us. We were your way in. Are you still lying to me? After all that happened, still lying? What did you say this morning? I came to say he's dangerous. That's what I wanted to tell you. What's he planning? Fucked-up things. Worse and worse things until you agree to work with him. The guy's insane. How did Farid end up in this mess? He was desperate. He thought he'd be a good liar. Did Sami kill Farid? Probably. In any event, he killed Zivko. And you tell me that now? You have no shame. There's bones. Oh, God. Want me to send it back? You're probably perfectly capable of sending it back yourself, Mom, huh? Oh, no one bosses me around quite as gloriously as you. Do you miss me? I do, of course I do. That's why we want you home. We want you home. I thought you'd be happy. Look, we've known for a while now, this isn't the right environment for you. You haven't even been living in one place since your dad threw you out. - I didn't throw her out. - You've been schlepping all over town. Now you're living at Farid's widow's house? Come on, sweetheart, this isn't good for your education, or frankly, your soul. OK? So come home. Let me look after you again, just... You've done your time. You've learnt lessons, it's over... What are you talking about? "Done her time"? What? You make it sound like it was a jail sentence or something, like a punishment, being with me. Don't make this difficult. Who was holding her hand at our son's funeral? - Who was it? It was me. - Please, please... Where were you? I'm sorry I wasn't the man I needed to be, all right? But I love her. I cherish her, and I do not reject her. I love you. Your father and I have had our problems for a long, long time. Just ignore them. None of this is to do with you. Why did you send me away, Mom? Don't make it about that, OK? Allison, come by the club later if you want to, I'm playing... I'm playing something I think you might like to hear, all right? But this business about taking Julie away, it's not happening. I'm sorry, Mom. Did you mean that? I meant every word. Good. What do we do now? Well... You... could come home? OK. OK. Let go of me! Where's the register? I emptied it! Are you ready for tonight? Uh... Did you finish those lyrics? No? What are you gonna do, get up there and freestyle? I got... I got something. Just... It's not finished. No disclaimers. Let me see. - It's not, you know... - Let me see them! I can't figure out what it is. OK. Maybe I can help. Well? These are beautiful. Thank you. What's the melody? You can read music. - Are we doing this? - We are doing this. I'm having flashbacks. OK. Do you... Have you played this before? A long time ago. - It's pretty. - Hmm. It's not me. That's... That's the Duke. - Duke Ellington. - Mm. You should do this. Yeah. When? All right, stay there. I'm on the way. - What's wrong? - We gotta go. I'm the owner. Two minutes. What can I do? Do you know who did this? Not yet. I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. All right, listen. We'll change the rotation. You'll never be alone at the club again, OK? It's OK. I've seen worse. Sim, are you OK? What's going on? - Don't worry, it's nothing. - Who hit my brother? It's OK, don't worry. Wait for me inside. I'll explain. Sir? - This wasn't random, was it? - I don't know. I don't know. I thought all this was over with, but apparently it's not. I don't know what's happening. - Thank you. - We'll keep you posted. Thank you. Come on, guys. We're open in one hour. Jude, Ludo, can you sweep? Please. Come on, guys. - Come on. - The tables. We don't have a lot of time. Hey, Jowee. Put this back here. See? Can you give me a hand? Elliot's up first, so move the microphones. How are you doing? Fine. Just... a lot going on. Like, your club was robbed and you're performing for the first time in four years? We can change something if you want. The band can start. No, no. The equipment's all set up. I'll start, go ahead... and get it over with. You will be amazing. You always were. And still are. I'm not the same man I was when I was performing. I like this man better. Really? And if you get scared, imagine everyone... - Naked. - Yes. And fucking each other. Whoa! You got a dirty mouth. I know. Good luck. Thank you. Hello. I'm Randy Kerber. I'm the pianist in The Eddy. Thank you. Thank you. I'm here to introduce... a true hero of mine. He hasn't done this in quite some time, so please... be kind. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the great... Elliot Udo. Thank you. Uh... Thank you all for coming tonight. It, uh... as... Randy said, it's been a very long time since I've been up here. And... I won't lie, I'm more than a little bit nervous. So what I'd like to play for you is... a melody that's been in my heart for a very long time. It's a song for my daughter. Because she... Uh, Ludo? Ludo, would you mind... coming to give me a hand? Ludo, ladies and gentlemen. Try that again. Um... Sorry. I just... Hey, are you OK? I don't... I don't know. You can do it. I don't think so. You want me to do it with you? Would you? Yeah. Cool. I'll probably need that. Thanks. A little change of schedule.

She's with her mom. - I need to make sure everybody's OK. - Don't you see we're not safe here? Look what just happened! That's not enough for you? - We need a solution, now. - OK. What does he want? Does he want to destroy us? It's the club, Amira. He wants the club. So give it to him. - Amira... - What? Give it to him? You know I can no longer picture Farid the way he was? I see him dead. I see his face bloody. I see his wound here. Because of this madman. I want to hurt him. We can hurt him. I just need to figure out how. I trust you, Elliot. - You OK? - I'm fine. - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. Well, you've had an exciting evening. It was a Molotov cocktail. Easy to make. They threw it into your office, but they knew you wouldn't be there. They didn't intend to kill you. - My daughter could have been in there. - What do you want me to say? Yes, she could, and you'd have been responsible. - I want to destroy him. - Who? You know who. He's the head of the G-19 or whatever. - And he really likes jazz. - Sami Ben Miled. I've wanted him in jail for a long time. All right, so let me help you. No. You've given me no reason to trust you. Come on! You put me in jail, first chance you could. I need you to trust me now. OK, so this is the last time we'll meet here. And one condition, because this is my operation: any concern, any idea you have, you come to me first. Fine. I have a condition too, though. If I'm in trouble, the first thing you do is find my daughter and you get her safe. Do you understand? Fair enough, yes. OK. It's good that you came here. You did the right thing. I don't know what's right. What do we do now? You go to him tomorrow. You tell him that you need his help, you need his protection. - I'm going undercover? - Of course not. You're not an officer. You'll gather information. You'll gather evidence for me. - Do I need to wear a wire? - They'd find it. All right. - Hello. - Hello. - I'd like to speak to Sami. - Who? Sami. He works here. Sixth floor. No. He doesn't work here. Come on, get in. Quite the view. All this is going to change. The port, with a tiny bit of help, has got permission to bring refrigerated items through. Before now, it's been mostly low level shit. What are you gonna be bringing through here? I'm sorry I had to be so unsubtle with my messages. No need for sorry. It worked. Convinced us. That you need me? No drugs. - I already said no. - And no violence. I don't shit on my own doorstep. Paplar is our contact. He'll protect his sister. He's an idiot, but OK, fine. And we agree you will be a silent partner. You'll have no influence whatsoever on business transactions. You want a lot. I also want the same money. Maybe the deal has changed. We need it. We have a club to repair. Somebody put a bomb in it. OK. I accept all your conditions, and I have no conditions. I'm excited. Good. Don't look so scared. You're not eating with the devil. In fact, I'll keep the devil away. We're gonna do this? Elliot Udo. I'm getting into bed with the great Elliot Udo. And he smells nice. You can make your way home, right? I need Paplar with me. NEW MESSAGE TO AMIRA Hey, Elliot, as you can see I made it to Iceland. And I'm about to run up a glacier. But I wanted to tell you that I love you, brother. Nothing dies. Not truly. You know, Fred will always be with you. I wish I could be with you, brother. But, um... I know you'll get through this. Over and out. Hey! - Hey, man! - Hi! Hi! Hey, man. He's calling you with melody! That's the boss. - What's up? - You gotta catch up. You OK? Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right. You? I knew if we took Julie hostage, you would come. Bam! What happened with the club, bro? It's closed. Structural damage. Do you know who planted the bomb? I don't know who did it. Police are working on it. They'll figure it out. What you guys all doing here? We love playing together. And you put us together. But now what do we do? Yeah, I need to make a living. We can worry about money later. I can get wedding gigs, man. I'd rather play on the street. Yep. That's actually a great idea. I'm joking, Jowee. Seriously, we could play in the street. What do you think, Elliot? - The street? - Which song we gonna play? You should maybe play "The Eddy." Yeah, "The Eddy" is nice. - But what about "Sooner or Later"? - Oh! ♪ Sooner or later ♪ No, we should play "The Eddy." - We should play "The Eddy." - Randy? - Do you know the lyrics? - Some. I don't believe you. ♪ Vortex of sound Revolving around ♪ If even Jowee knows, we can sing! We can go inside and get the horns if you want. Let's do it. - Yeah, we're back! - To the street! Yeah!
