Franck Lévy was here tonight. In the club. He was listening to... Hey, guys, why did Franck Lévy come? Because he was hearing buzz about you all over Paris. So stop pouting. He came tonight, I talked to him, he was listening to you. He didn't want to talk 'cause he was having fun listening to you. Show some team spirit. When I say you were good, I mean it. Sleep on that. Tomorrow you come back and do the same as tonight, but better. Bye, guys. - We're good. - Kat, don't leave! That's the good news. Alright, guys? Night, guys. Get some practice in. Maja, when you're singing, forget Elliot. Get him out of your head. - He was staring at me. - I know. I know it's complicated but... I know you. The audience didn't notice, but I know you can do better. OK? Forget him. Think about yourself. You sing. - It's what moves you. - Thank you. - Go on, you too. - The two brothers... See you tomorrow.

We'll get you paid. - Hey. - Hey, hey. Hey! Maja! Hey. Maja! - Hey. I here for money. - OK. - Where is the money? - Farid is not here. Come back tomorrow. Where is the money? - What's the matter with you? - Where is the money? Elliot? You OK? You're bleeding. Hey! Elliot? Elliot! Hey! Farid! Farid! Hey! I've got kids trying to sleep here! - What's wrong with you? - Where's Farid? What happened? - Will you...? - Come in. Quiet. Farid's not here. I told you it would sting. - Ready? - No. Come on! It could leave a small scar. You could look sexy. Hmm? Like a... cowboy. Old... cowboy. Old, old... Really, really old. I feel old. So how did it happen? Hmm? - What was it? - Don't worry. Where is Farid? I don't know. You should know. - He tells me the band is almost great. - He's wrong. Tell me more. Tell you what? It's a club. It's OK. It's OK? That's all you and Farid ever say. Either you say nothing or you say it's OK. - I don't understand. - Mm. You don't understand French when it suits you! You know, Elliot... ...we've put everything we have into this. So have I. No offense, but we have more to lose than you. Shit. Don't look at me like that. This was your fault. - What happened? - What happened? Hey, wait for me! I'm talking to you. I was closing up last night. Dude comes in saying we owe him money. - A buddy of yours? - He was looking for me? - Yes. Where were you? - Meeting a guy about new speakers. At two in the morning? They're probably hot, but nobody'll know. Don't worry. Man, what are we, crooks, now? I gotta get beat up every time I leave the club? Don't worry about that guy. Listen to me. Truth is, I bought some cheap booze from him and... I didn't pay him back. How much do we owe him? Five. Thousand. Man, come on! You're interested in our finances now? Come on, this'll be fun. We'll talk grants, payroll, taxes, permits... You realize that running a club takes a lot more than... Hey! Just tell me, man. Are we in trouble? No, don't worry. Franck Lévy called me. He's calling you, not me? Yeah. They won't sign us just yet. But you'll see, with time, it'll happen. It will. ♪ With time, with time, with time ♪ Of course it takes time, my brother. Hmm. - Something new? - Might be. What do you think of it? Go major. Try it faster. Faster. It's nice. - Hi. - Hi. Please, come in. Haven't we met before? - Have we? - I think we have. - I'm not sure. - We have. I don't remember. It was a summer evening, along the river. You two make me sick. I brought lunch. - Lunch? - Mm-hmm. Shit. I gotta go. - What was that about? - I don't know. Naturally. Something good? - Hey, hey! - Hi. - Come here. - I stink! It's nice to see you. Is it? Did you carry your clarinet on, or did you check it? - What happened to your face? - Don't worry about it. - Maybe I didn't bring it. - Julie, Julie... - That's a good instrument. Don't check... - Dad, I just landed. Hi. Hello. How about a hug? Hmm? Hmm? Come on, come on. All right. Let's get out of here. OK. Please tell me you didn't bring that dumb bike to take me home. Hey! - Hey, fuck you, asshole! - Hey, hey. Fuck you! I like it when you wear stockings. And it's convenient. You always say the sexiest things. I'll wear them more often. Did you talk to him about Maja? That's none of our business. Did you talk to him about the club? That's our business. Oh, sorry. - Katarina, it's fine! - No! - Come in! - No! - Now they know we're sleeping together! - That's not it. It's embarrassing. You told me no one was here. She's out there. - It's not funny. - Katarina, come! Stop it! - I'm not coming back. - OK. - I mean it. - Farewell. Farewell. Eat. Maja! Maja! I broke down. Julie. Julie, come here. Hey, you, uh... You remember Julie, right? She needs a glass of water and a shower. Hi. Please? - It's all I've got. - Thank you. How was your flight? Oh, God, it was terrible. The guy beside me kept farting. Every time he farted he looked at me because he felt bad about it. So I couldn't hate him. He kept looking at me with this look on his face. Like... Like this. Like, he was like... And I was just, like... "Um, I'm sorry..." OK, that's enough. Thanks, Dad. What's the story here? No story. No story? OK. Time for my shower. The blue towel is clean. - Thank you. - Welcome. What happened to your face? You don't like it? You come to my apartment and you act like I'm making you uncomfortable? - Thank you, Maja, for taking us in. - I took her in, not you. I've been working on something. Want to hear it? - What happened to your piano? - It was your piano. - Yeah, I know it was. - So I sold it. I had to call my mother this morning, for... money for my rent, and she gave it to me, but she says... she always says, "Maja, you made great money in New York, why do you do this to yourself?" And you know what? For the first time I couldn't answer the question. Invite her to the club. Let her hear you sing. You think I want her here when I'm like this?
