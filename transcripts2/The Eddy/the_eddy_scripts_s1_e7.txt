 What was your relationship to Zivko Bodovic? He was... He was a supplier, and I... You can't even remember which lie you're telling. I do remember and I'm telling you, I had nothing to do with his death. You have nothing to do with the physical act of killing him but the games you're playing, they are absolutely the reason why he's dead. Why else would they leave the body outside your club? Let me help you. Otherwise, you too will be found dead. He was a counterfeiter. Running notes through the club. Farid was helping. Some of the money is missing. - And they had a dispute? - I don't know. I don't know. I just know it didn't end well for either one of them. Why did you lie to me? Believe it or not, I just wanted to keep the club open. Right. Let's go back to the beginning, and you tell me everything you know. You're late. Don't push it. You guys ready to go? Almost ready. We need something for a bridge. - Where's Elliot, man? - How the fuck do I know, bro? Hey, do we have a drummer or what? He will come, no worries.

No. - You're sure? - I don't think so, no. OK. If you see any of them, you call me. Understood? Understood. OK, you can go. That's it? For now. OK, no big speeches from me. But we're gonna do four songs today and then four songs tomorrow. And then we'll do solo overdubs for most of the tracks. Quit the phone. Who let the phone? We're in a studio here! OK.

Hey. - A boy's waiting for you downstairs. - What? - A boy's waiting for you downstairs. - Now? Yes, now. No. So, are you two dating? No. No, no. Just friends. But... Listen, Sim, I'm really, really tired. I worked all night, I had to wash a dead body covered in vomit. So I need you to be clear and precise. - So, Julie... - Mm? Tell me about her! I don't know, tell me... Tell me how you feel when you're with her. Well... Well, I don't know. What I want is to start over. With a clean slate. But as friends. Remember... Didn't I just tell you? I need you to be clear. And right now, you're not. OK. I'm nice... ...with her, with most people. And I'm a musician. I work hard. And... and we like the same music. And I make her laugh. Sometimes. Just sometimes, not always. What else can I say? I approve. You have my permission. Hi. Oh, I'm such an idiot. I like your hair. Thanks. Katarina Kovacevic. - That's me. - Please. OK. You want us to reconsider your father's rights? I need a disability card. He's completely disabled. We need more help. We can't pay for him. It seems his payments were stopped due to fraud. Yes, but that was six months ago. I was told his case would be reconsidered. You used a fake social security number to obtain health insurance. Yes, and I was fined. I'm paying it off. But it was an emergency. He needed treatment. I'll schedule you for another appointment. Can it be soon? I'm booking you another appointment even though you committed fraud. It will take a while. Please. My sister and I, we're working so hard just to... Sounds good. Yeah. How's Balmont? What did the police say? I told them the truth. She warned me that things might get bad. Hurry, I'll punch you in. Hurry. OK, listen up. We're still having problems with the smell on the second floor. As for the mop heads, management hears you. It'll take a week or two. Silence! Shut the fuck up. And you're still using too much bleach. We're getting complaints about the toilets. The floor is cracked, it can't be cleaned properly. It must be cleaned properly. OK, that's all. Get to work. I drove past you coming into work. I told you, you have to be on time. You weren't on time. You are not me. Anyway, today you work three hours. - I'm supposed to work six. - No, three. And the toilets on five. I think... we... happened in the wrong order. We happened in the wrong order? Oh, you mean, me climbing on top of you right after we met? - Yeah. - That part. You know, we meet, we talk, we like each other, and then you accuse me, you say I'm a dealer. I'm sorry. Then your dad comes to my house and goes crazy. Yeah. Hot mess. Next we see each other at a funeral. Where you tell me to go fuck myself? Then we go walking with a gun. The gun, you remember? I can't forget that. - You get expelled. - Mm-hmm. So worth it! Are you, like... Not into it? A little too crazy for you, or something? Do you want to come on a date with me? You're asking me out on a date? Yes. Are you courting me, young man? You are in Paris, you know? Romance is... the most important. You already wrote me that corny-ass song, so you don't have to take me on a date. OK. We call it a "day." - Our day. - Our day? You will spend the day with me? Yeah, I'll spend the day with you. - Yeah? - Yeah. Took you long enough.

Good? Yeah, it's all right. I'm fine. Just gonna have to check the headphones and a few stuff. I like your feel, man, so take your time. - All right. - Get as many takes as you need. - We'll start with "Barfly." - Yeah, yeah. Cool. I really appreciate you doing this, OK? - OK, Elliot? - All good. I'm waiting. Check the sound. - What are you doing here? - Sami sent me. Sami? Who... Who the fuck is Sami? My boss. Not Zivko. Sami want to see you. No. I've done that before. Not with Sami. No. You want to know what happened to Farid? You come. Sit down. You put this on? Me? No. I hate jazz. You want coffee? Coke? Sprite? Elliot Udo... Sorry for everything, interrupting your work. Were you working? You look tired. Can I get you something? Coffee, Coke, Sprite? Andrej, could you bring two Cokes, please? For me and for Mister Udo. The music, huh? Wow. B-sides, Village Vanguard. Live, 1996. "Udo at the Vanguard." I love it, this record. Very... dope. Is that right? "Dope"? Please. I don't know where to start. Maybe with the drums? Who's your favorite drummer of all time? - Really? - Buddy Rich. My dad took me to see him as an 11-year-old. He was astonishing. He did a ten-minute solo. - Made me lose my mind... - Did you kill Farid? No. That was Zivko. And Zivko? Did you kill him? I ordered it. Zivko worked for me. He was a liar, and careless. I don't like liars. They make mistakes and problems. Zivko was my problem. Problem solved. I never said to kill Farid. I don't have your money. If that's what you're looking for. I've looked everywhere and it's gone, all right? The counterfeit, you mean? That's what I mean. No. Also Zivko. I don't owe anybody? I'm sure you still owe somebody that money. It's just not me. Elliot. Please. Can I call you Elliot? I make... I make investments. Silent, mostly. With my businesses, I try not to get involved in the day-to-day. I would like to offer you my help. The band is full. Sorry. Five hundred thousand euro. An all-cash investment in the Eddy. Half for you, half for Farid's widow. It is the least I could do, since Zivko killed her husband. What, drug money? Drugs would be nowhere near. I'll own a third of the club as your new silent partner. We'll install a state-of-the-art bar. We'll get some better soundproofing. And this new album you're making, the money will help with marketing, to give it the push it needs. Not only here in France. Worldwide. Isn't that what you want? What Farid wanted? I think he would have jumped at the opportunity. Did you know Farid? I can help. I can help you clear out all this shit, and give you no shit. All I care about is jazz. Stable finances, guaranteed. Guaranteed income. For your band, for your staff, and for Amira. You could focus on your own work. Like the old days. Andrej, Mr. Udo is ready. You give it some thought, OK? Hey. I need to talk to you. - Yes? - Can I come in? We missed you today. And yesterday. - How... - You need to tell him to be careful. - Who? - Elliot. I saw him leaving the club today. He got into a car. I know where they went. He shouldn't have. He can't. Don't worry. He's just managing things, and Zivko is gone. Are you people fucking crazy? With Zivko gone, it's not good. Now he's meeting Sami. So how is this any fucking good? Calm down. Sit down. He told you, right? About me, and what I did? Katarina... Who is Sami? Boss of a big crime organization. A gang called G-19. Farid was terrified of him. How do you know that? Just tell Elliot. It's important, OK? I saw you hired Balmont. Yes, we did. I like Balmont. He's good. Yeah. Just tell him to stay away from Sami. Bye, Maja. Yeah, that was all right. - What? - Comme ci, comme ça. What about you? - Fine? - Not bad. What? I forgot. I forgot. I found something. - Checking out Tinder? - No. I googled you. - You googled me? - Yeah. You and your dad. You googled me and my dad? Creep alert! Do you know how to use an iPhone? It's a little buggy. Oh, here it is. This is it. What is this? - You haven't seen this? - No. Some of you may know this... some of you may not. I, uh, have a daughter. Who recently turned two years old. Very difficult. She's definitely a handful. Terrible twos, they say. But honestly, you know, my daughter is... She's incredible. When she gets upset with us, with my wife and I, and she cries, her voice perfectly ascends the A-major scale. It's incredible. And she's started fooling around with some instruments that we have laying around the house. A horn, an old guitar. And she just has this incredible... curiosity in her eyes. And all my life, nobody ever told me that the most beautiful thing in the world is watching a child discover their own imagination. He said you're beautiful. Now, I'll tell you, you try putting that little monster to sleep. Yeah, you got your hands full. But there is this... There's this one tune I play that always seems to do the trick. So I'd like to share it with you, OK? It's an old classic that I rearranged. And you all, feel free to fall asleep if you want to. This one is for Julie. - Hey. - Hey. You have a good day? - A phenomenal day. - You have a good night? Yes, the best night. - Shush! I'm trying to sleep! - Hey, you wanted to sleep on the sofa. - So there you are. - Sorry! - Good night, dear. - Good night. - Good night, sweetheart. - Good night. Hello. I'd like to ask you a few questions. May I? Come in. Thank you. Did you know him? Is he a friend of yours? An acquaintance. He died outside your club. It's not my club. And I no longer play there. OK, he died outside the club where you used to play. What was your relationship with Farid Youssfi? He was a friend. Zivko Bodovic was using the club to launder counterfeit bills. You introduced him to Farid. Can you explain? I know nothing. You've got a record. - No. - Yes, you do. You were arrested and charged. Aggression against your father. Assault. You claimed he abused you. That was a long time ago. And now you look after him? Yeah. Right. See you soon. A detective? It doesn't matter. About Zivko? No. - About Dad? - No. - Are we in trouble? - No. ♪ Days go by without you ♪ ♪ I can be discreet ♪ ♪ Never talk about you ♪ ♪ Never miss a beat ♪ ♪ Can't stay away ♪ ♪ For very long ♪ ♪ Can't stay away, stay gone ♪ ♪ I know they say that this is wrong ♪ ♪ I belong, can't stay away ♪ ♪ Think I've lost this yearning ♪ ♪ Hoping I am free ♪ ♪ Till I find myself turning ♪ ♪ Left onto your street ♪ ♪ Can't stay away for very long ♪ ♪ Can't stay away, stay gone ♪ ♪ I know they say that this is wrong ♪ ♪ I belong, can't stay away ♪ We tell these people no, and there will be consequences. - I know. - I'm sorry. It's OK. But we can't go to the police 'cause there will be consequences for that too. So we tell no one? Yeah, but we've been telling no one for a long time and it just gets worse. Hey. Hey. I'm trying something new. I see that. I like it. Yeah? I'll leave you alone. Oh, that's OK. I was just, um, gonna say hey. Catch you later. Yeah, sure. So what do we do? Say no to this guy. Don't go to the police, and we wait. We don't know enough to decide. I need to see Sami. I need to see Sami. Please. May I see Sami? You recognize this? - Are you wearing a wire? - No. No? I said no. - Does your mom know where you are? - Why are you here? None of your business. Hey! I'm not wearing a wire! I introduced Zivko to the club. Elliot knew nothing of it. Please, have a seat. I know who you are. And I can talk to the police. Because you like to talk. Because I have this. I hid the rest of the money somewhere safe. And I left instructions. If there's a problem... if I disappear all of a sudden, they'll trace it to you. So you win. That's... That's impressive. You came here just to tell me this? I want you to stay away from Elliot. That's not for you to decide. You don't scare me. You play the drums, right? And you were fired, right? Perhaps I'll crush your fingers, and break your wrists. It's not like you need them anymore. You know how much I make off this fake money? Not enough to worry about. But a man died because he couldn't find these stupid bills. And that I cannot forgive. Almost finished with your recording? Not quite. Still a few tracks left. I heard you... went on a date. - You did? - That's what I heard. I did go on a date. - And? - It was nice. It was nice. We got burgers. Mm? - And we walked through the park. - I'm listening. Yeah, it was nice. You and Sim Shady, huh? What? Nothing. I'm just looking at you. Maybe it's the hair, but... You look more and more like your grandmother. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Miss Juliette Roberta. Your namesake. I sure wish you'd gotten to meet my mom before she passed. Yeah, me too. How does it feel? Your hair. You like it? Feels good. Feels really good. Feels like I'm... not fighting myself anymore. - Thanks for the book. - Yeah? Yeah, there's plenty more where that came from. You know, there's a whole history of us in this place. Bricktop. Arthur Briggs. - Josephine Baker. - Yeah. I've definitely heard of that person before. Hmm. I used to... Used to fight myself too. When I was in school they told me, "Play the classics." And I did, but... I didn't realize that they meant their classics. And... one day I woke up and saw that I had left myself behind. And I got used to leaving people behind. I'd like for you to come home... Juliette. I'm... almost ready. Just not yet. OK. Hello? Sami... Yeah. I heard. I tried to settle with him. This is who he really is. I have the money. What? The money. Zivko, 150,000. You stole it from the club? No, I didn't. Just listen to me. I... I... I know your father is very sick, Katarina. - But if you needed money... - No, that's not it. - And I would have tried to figure... - No, Elliot. - You didn't have to... - Fuck him! My father was not a father to me. Or my sister. We take care of him because we have to. And that's all. I don't understand. I know you don't. You can't. Some things are better that way. Farid told me to hide the money. I did it for him. I did it to protect you. And the club. He was involved with people... He had no idea. People far worse than Zivko. You mean Sami? His gang, G-19. They feed on people like parasites. With the money gone, I thought they would think that Zivko stole it and just leave us alone. Then it got worse... and worse, and then... I still... I still said nothing. It was... It seemed better to live in the lie. I know. I know what that's like. - But Elliot, he's gone! - I know. Hey, don't cry. - I'm so sorry. - It's OK. - I'm sorry. - It's not your fault. - Listen to me... - He's gone! Listen to me. It's not your fault. I'm sorry. It's OK. Did you send the files and back them up? Hurry up, Pierrot's picking up the stuff in ten minutes. We have the album. It's gonna be good. Hey, we need to re-record the drums. - Balmont was fine. - The drums were off, and you know it. We need Katarina. - You fired her. - Yeah, and I re-hired Katarina. She's on her way here now. No. Hey, stop it. Stop it. Please. We're not releasing this album without Katarina, OK? The album's already been sent off for mastering. - Then bring it back, Franck. - Back? Who's gonna pay for this? - Can you? I can't? - Well, what will it take? You, playing on the album. Then at least I'll get some press and sell a few copies. You know I can't do that. OK, so we have no problem with his drums. Let's hurry it up, guys. All right, fine. I'll... I'll do it. Really? Just give me a few days. - I'll give you everything you want. - But we do the drums now. Right now. OK. I'm sorry, there's been a change of plan. We're going to put it all back. Repatch and re-cable everything. - We're redoing the drums. - Oh, no! It's not the end of the world. Can you call Pierrot? We're canceling. Get with the program, man. Get with the program. I know what we can do. That gives me an idea. You're gonna love this. You especially. OK, ready? - No, no! - Oh, yeah! Come on, Randy! Yeah! Guys, guys, guys... Here. Sit. I leave and you become gentlemen? Right... Let's see if you guys have fucked up the songs, then. Well, we'll let you... get to it. It's good to see you. We missed you. Thanks. OK. "Barfly." OK. We will start with "Barfly." Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
