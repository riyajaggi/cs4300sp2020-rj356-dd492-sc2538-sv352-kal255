 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES What... are you doing here? Ever heard of privacy? We closed early. With Eid al-Adha tomorrow, the cabaret was empty, so... - You're bored. - Yeah, I'm bored. Grandma? Grandma? Grandma? Grandma? What time is it? It was 5 a.m. two minutes ago when you asked me.

 You need some coffee? - I want to sleep. - Then sleep. - How are you still awake? - I think I'm starting to figure this out. In May, May of last year, there were sudden injections of cash. Now I don't remember us getting any busier during that time, do you? I don't remember what was yesterday. You promised to help me sort this mess out, yesterday. I hate yesterday. I need to pee. Hey, it's Balmont. He'll play. - You have to explain to the band. - We have no choice. - We need someone great for the album. - Good luck! Holy shit.

 There's cameras. Come, come. - I don't give a fuck. - Shh! Come here. I've got some help, now. I'm retracing his steps and that will lead me to the money. I just need some time. I have no time, OK? My boss is mad. I need this money. You have till midnight. OK? OK. Elliot. Go to the police. Shit. You want breakfast? No, thank you. You want to make me breakfast? It won't be edible. The rules here: One, no smoking and no drugs. Two, no sex. Three, the toilet always clean. And four, no one in the house from 9 to 6. OK? Yes. I work nights, so I need to sleep during the day. So you want me to leave, right now? Yes. - Quickly and quietly. - Like, you want me to evacuate the house? If you prefer, you can go back to Maja. Or to your dad. No problem for me. So? OK. Your keys. Thank you very much. Hey, it's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK. You came to our wedding, you know? You walked behind Farid and me, like... How do you say it again? A bridesmaid. A little, little bridesmaid. Now, I always remember your father's smile. I don't. For a spot in paradise, support the construction of the mosque, my brothers! By the grace of God! Good of you. Hey, how are you? Hey, kids, all good? Sim, how are you? Any spare change for the charity? You work for them? Sorry, bro, I have nothing. - No worries, next time. - Yeah. - How's your brother Tarif? - Good. - And your grandma? - She's cool. - Tell her I said hi. - Sure, will do. - I like her. - Who doesn't? MEN ♪ Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar ♪ ♪ So pray to your Lord And offer sacrifice ♪ ♪ Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off ♪ ♪ Allah is great ♪ Allah is great. ♪ Allah listens To the one who praises Him ♪ Allah listens to the one who praises Him. ♪ Allah is great ♪ Allah is great. - Hey, guys. - Hey, what's up? Uh... listen. So... Katarina is not coming back. She's leaving the band. - What? - Yeah. Wait, you're joking. She'd never do that to us. Why? - She needs something new. - That's bullshit. No, no. This is about her dad. She needs help, man. She's drowning in this. Where does she live? I know it's not easy to hear this. But I think we should just stay focused on the album. I do. - We record in a week, so... - Yeah, without a drummer? No, Balmont's gonna help us out. - Éric Balmont? - Éric Balmont, yeah. He's gonna help us out, how? He's gonna record with us, and if it goes well and if you guys of course all agree, then he may stick around and play with us permanently. So that guy knew about Katarina... before us. He did, because I wanted to find a backup plan before I brought you guys the bad news, OK? Hey... Balmont is good, no? - He's good. No? - He's all right. - Balmont's good. - All right. He's stopping by later to rehearse. I made a few changes to the scores. You guys can go ahead and get started without me. I gotta go meet Franck Lévy. But... yeah. - Hello, Mrs. Denfer. - How are you? - Well, and you? - I'm all right. - "Kha." - "Ha," not "kha." "Ha, ha, ha." "Kha." And try the "ha." "Ha..." - "Ha." - "Ha." "Ha," like "Eid." - "Eid." - "Eid." - You're a disaster! - What's Eid? It's like Christmas for Muslims. But we sacrifice a sheep, not a turkey. That's much more interesting than some basic-ass American turkey. What are you doing here? Hi. Surprise. You look really nice. Oh. What are you doing here? I'm stalking you. Just kidding. I listened to the song you sent me. Oh. Cool. Can you wait for me downstairs? What's going on? Please. Uh, sure. Thank you very much. I will be practicing my "Ha." - "Ha." - "Ha." - All right. - No hope for you! You can wash your hands. - OK. - OK. - What's with the attitude? - The Pilgrimage. It's just a flyer they send to old people. It's nothing. Stop... You requested a form. Anyway, it's not possible. It's in two months and they want 4,000 euros right away. Short of winning the lottery... Grandma? The brochure was free. This is my last chance. Yes. So, are you on Instagram? Or like, any other social media? - Yo. - Happy holidays, bro. Hi. Took me 40 minutes to come see you. You don't even give a fuck. Wait! - Julie, wait! - What? What's going through that weird little head of yours? It's just... I'm stressed about tonight. - Why? - There is a concert for Eid. Why are you stressed? I may sing. - You're gonna sing? - Mm-hmm. - The song that you sent me? - Yes. That's why I wanted your thoughts on it. I came 40 minutes, to come see you, to tell you what I thought of your song. I thought it was fucking good. Thanks. You're welcome. OK, come. Everything is good with changes? No problems? - We're good. - Jude? Jude. Oh, you're the boss, now? Balmont will come soon. We are ready? Just because you fuck him doesn't mean you are the boss. I'm not fucking him. I'm not fucking him either. - Éric, hi! - Hey. Randy... - Hello, Randy. I'm Éric. - Hey. - Nice to meet you. - You too. - Jude. - Hello, Jude. Generally he's great. - Ludo, Jowee. - Hi. - Ludo. - Hey. - Hey, Jowee. - What's up? Bless. This is cool! - The pleasure is all mine. - Come on. Us, too. It's our pleasure. Be nice. - No concert tonight. - What? Look. Fucking hell! What happened here? They took everything: the computers, the printers... We put all our equipment here last night. THERE IS STRENGTH IN DIVERSITY How much was the gig going to raise? Uh, including ticket sales and subsidies, I don't know, around 7,000 euros. If I find your stuff, will you give me half? Sim, you know it's not my money, right? It's to help people from the neighborhood. But I'm from the neighborhood too. I need help too. Wait, are you scamming me? - Did you steal the equipment? - Listen. I didn't steal anything, OK? But I really need this money. What was that? Trying to make money off of a charity who just got robbed? I can't explain, but it's fine. Well, OK. Are you OK? You don't understand. I have a meeting. OK? I can't stay with you. Go home. I can't go home. - I think it's better you go home. - I can't go home. I call you. Wait! What's wrong with you? I can help you! - I call you later. - Fuck that! Hello. Yeah, I need to see you... I need to see you. Was he for real? He'd actually burn my place down? My house? Listen, it all started around May of last year, at least... At least, I think it did. I don't know. Do you remember any shift or any little change in him? Anything? You know very well he always pretended to be fine! He could have two broken legs, and he'd make you think he could walk. Shit. We need to find that money. - Hello. - Hello. If you want to stay, order something. OK. Um... - A lemonade, then. - A lemonade? What kind? - I don't know. - Any kind is OK? - Yes, sounds good. - OK. Here, I'll throw in the shorts and the glasses too. Cut it out, I'll take just the polo. Just the polo? All right, how's ten bucks? - I'll pay you later, OK? - What do you mean? - You already owe me... - You know about the stolen stuff? Bro! You interested? - You sure? - No, thanks. Our equipment's been stolen. - Why would I know about that? - Because you're Mr. Connected. They'll ask you to resell it. I'm Mr. Connected? - Yeah. - Connected to what? Look, Paplar, I need your help, OK? Just tell them to return it. But what's the problem? The charity is insured, the guys make some cash. It's win-win. No, but the insurance only covers the stolen stuff, not the gig! I see. It's close to your heart, huh? You still got your cart? It's a two-way street, bro. You need help from Mr. Connected? He needs yours too. - Yeah, I got my cart. - There you go. Found anything? No. I don't even know what to look for. A clue. Something to help me find this money. - A clue? - Yeah. Farid would have been ashamed of this mess. You know it. He would have hidden the money where we couldn't find it. All this is pointless. Go see the cops. Go tell them everything. I don't care about the album or your club or any of that shit. They're insane, Elliot. Look what they've done. - What's in the fucking box? - Shit! Sorry. Shit. I'm sorry. What's in that box? Bread for my sandwiches. So Amira's brother is a baker? Yeah, he's the best. You don't know the baguette of Paplar? I must go. I must go... Tell me what's in the box and I'll leave you alone. What are you doing? You're acting hard. It's weird. It scares me. Stop it. I don't like it. Are you OK? Are you in trouble? - It's just some iPhones, OK? - Are they stolen? - No, they're fake. - Where do you have to deliver them to? Does Tarif know about this? Hey! Let me come with you or I'm gonna tell your brother and your grandma. Mr. Udo, hello. You're late. We're getting nowhere. My boss thinks you're lying to me. I said, "Yes, he's lying, but one day photos will tell the truth." I'm not lying. - Who is this man? - He's a supplier. Alcohol. Good. You have his number, then. I'd like to talk to him. - OK. - What happened to his face? I couldn't tell you. Looks similar. Don't you think? Not the same man. I know who he is, where he lives, who he's connected to. If he tells us that you are mixed up in his business... I'm not. I'm not. Aside from him supplying us alcohol... At 5 a.m.? Supplying alcohol? - We start early. - Bullshit. You just can't stop lying. You're not the first to tell me that. But you're wrong. - Can I go? - Yes, you can go. Have you been writing for a long time? Sim? Have you been writing for a long time? No. It's my first song. OK? Can you stop it? You're really good. The part where you talk about... how you feel like you've known her forever, and... The song is not about you. It's about my grandmother. Really? It's very sexy for a song about your grandmother. - It's not sexy! - It's very sexy. - No, you don't understand the words. - Yes, I do. And I know sexy. Oh, shit. - Hold this for me, please. - Yep. Oh, shit, the wheel... Shit... Shit! What? - Forget it. - What the fuck? Keep moving. Keep moving. I didn't know. You didn't know? ♪ Night will fall On my head again ♪ ♪ Alcohol is all I let in ♪ ♪ I'm not going anywhere soon ♪ ♪ I'll chat with that cat in the moon ♪ ♪ I've been bruised in the game of love ♪ ♪ So abused in the name of love ♪ ♪ All that romance was a bust ♪ ♪ I don't know... ♪ I need to talk to you. - I need to talk to you right now. - It sounds good. Hey. - Listen... Please. - I'm having a hard day, man. Please. - What do you want? - Listen to me! That guy, your guy... Listen to me. He's a great drummer. I agree. But it doesn't work. Katarina is not coming back, OK? She ain't coming back. This is a great opportunity. We're gonna sound like shit, man! Do me a favor, man. Please, please make it work. OK? Come on. Come on, man. Hey! This isn't an iPhone! - Well, no. - I should have tossed it in the river. - I'll toss you in the Seine. What's wrong? - What? You got balls? Huh? Tell me. You know Mr. Connected? Well, you owe him. You're not Mr. Connected. You're just a piece of shit. You fucking clown. You know your stolen equipment? I found a customer, you asshole! - Are you OK? - Why did you open that fucking box? Huh? I'm sorry. I just want money to send her to Mecca. Who? My grandmother. She had cancer before. Now, it's second time. Can you ask your parents for money? My father, he left when I was six. He acted tough. He was violent. A druggie. My mother, she's gone. So... Where is she? I don't know. Marseille? No idea. My grandma and Tarif... they're my only family. They're all I have left. And my grandmother, she need this. And I cannot give it to her. What if we found the equipment somewhere else? Would that work? - You're late. - No. - They've cancelled the gig. - What? Are you serious? - I'm trying to come up with a plan. - Since when do you come up with plans? Your mate who does the markets, could he lend us his van? What are you doing? The police, Maja, they know about Zivko. What do they know? They know he was here, they know he's the man I identified, and they want to talk to him. I need to find this money. Listen, Elliot, downstairs, the situation is going to explode! - Elliot! - I don't have time, Maja. I have less than six hours. Why save the club if you have no band? - Since when does she want to go to Mecca? - Since we went to the doctor. Oh, yeah, right. You weren't there. Seeing as you left, bro. You've been gone two weeks. Two weeks! What are you saying? Forget it, just keep on pretending everything's fine. Hey, guys. - Where do we go in? - You can't. - They don't know we're coming. - Are you fucking kidding me? You pressured Awa, carried a gun around, and now you wanna steal from a school? We're not stealing. These people have money in the Cayman Islands. I think they'll be fine without a drum set for one night. It's cool. Promise. OK. There's a space out back. You guys can wait there. RECEPTION Hey! You told me there'd be nobody. Yeah, I forgot about the Saturday classes. - How did you forget? - Just act normal. It's fine. That's not normal. Like a person. What are your hands doing? - I'm trying! - You know where you're going? OK. I'll meet you up there. - Are you looking for someone? - Sylvia! - Hey, how'd you do that? - Blowjob. To the watchman. What? A blowjob! - Seriously? - No! Kidding. Jesus Christ, you think I try to sleep with everyone? Just you, buddy. Just you. OK. What else? What? - Mics. - Mics. I'm gonna go get a cart. - The cart? - Yeah, I saw it by the emergency exit. OK. This is what a breakdown looks like. - Your drummer's leaving. - What? Your drummer's leaving. I thought you should know. Hey, Éric. Éric, wait. Wait, wait, wait. - What's going on? - Hey. Look, man. I love your music. But holy shit, your band... It's not gonna work. Éric, please. Good luck, man. Please. Please, listen. Hey... Sim? "It is the east... and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon!" What are you doing in here? And who is he? Um... But I didn't feel what we just heard. I didn't feel it. See? That's another point, now. Well done, guys. Well, well fucking done. - What? - Has he gone? Shame. Hey, Jude, where were you when I found you? - Elliot, don't do that. - Where were you when I found you? And what about you, Jowee? Where were you? None of y'all were anything. - You don't mean that. - Yes, I do mean that. Who the fuck do you think you are? I just told you who I am, man. I'm the one that made this fucking band. And you all are fucking up my chance, our chance, to make an album together. I don't need you, man. I don't need you. - It was about Farid, man. - I don't need you. Then go! Go, then! Go! The door is right there. Go back to your bathroom stalls. Stop, Elliot! - Don't call me, bro. - Stop! - I said... - I'll stop when I'm ready to stop. You got two minutes to say something that'll make me stay in this band. - Exactly. - The band? The band is done. - What? - The club is done. Elliot. Yeah? Elliot! What? Shit. Be right there. Take care of yourself, Mr. Udo. Well, you're expelled. That's what you wanted, right? What did Sim put you up to? - No, Dad, it was my idea. - It was... Why? - His grandma has cancer. - What? Sim's grandma has cancer. She wants to go to Mecca. Sim doesn't have the money to send her and he needed equipment. Sim is just going through a really hard time right now. And it's really not fair. And I understand what it's like to be in that position, and I just wanted to help him. Because I try to help people. I do. And I don't abandon them. It's not who I am. You're 16 years old. You do not have to know who you are just yet. - Hey, can you... - You want me to go in the dressing room? Please. Whatever's happening here, she's right. Nice club. No band. Only ghosts. You like that? It was bullshit at the airport? I meant everything I said. But still destroy everything. Yeah. Yeah, I do. So call them back and tell them the truth. Now. You call Jowee and Ludo, I'll call Randy and Jude. No, you call everybody. How long you know that? About the forgeries, I knew since Farid died. About Katarina, I found out the other day when she left. Why didn't you tell us anything, bro? I thought it would be easier. I was wrong. I'm sorry. How can we trust you, man? You've been hiding everything from us. And now here we are, again, man. What's going on? Joweee, you're right. And I'm sorry. And if I were you I wouldn't trust me either, man. I understand. - So what happens now? - I don't know. I'd like to open the club tonight. Can you play without a drummer? We can.… We can try. Yeah? I say, let's do that. After you, there's somebody else I'd like to have play on the stage. If that's OK. And after that... I'm gonna call the police. I don't know if they're gonna shut us down for good. But let me say this. I hope this is not the end of our band. Because I really... really, really love making music with you all. OK? OK. OK, man. OK. Hey, are you OK? Yeah. Did your dad kill you? It's complicated. Julie... - Thank you for today. - It failed. - I must go. - Wait, Sim. My dad wants to open the... I've been looking for you. Tarif came to see me. I'm sorry. I wanted to help you go to Mecca. But I can't. I don't care about Mecca. You and your brother are my Mecca. I don't want you to die. I know, it's shit. I love you. Pick up. Pick up. Julie... I can't talk right now. OK, shut up and listen. Can you come to the club tonight?
