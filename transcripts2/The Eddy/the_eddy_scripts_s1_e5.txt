 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Stop, stop! It's great, but try it a bit more ethereal, breathier. More like Marilyn, you know? Give it a go. From the top. Fantastic. Um... Make love with the snake. - You know what I mean? Just imagine... - Yes, of course. From the top. But it's great. Fantastic. That's great. That's the one.

 - Who on earth enjoys a drum solo? - Me. No, you're just impressed by a drum solo, that's different. Listen, let's forget about jazz. Come work with me. - Work with you? That music is... - Shit. - Shit! Big shit. - Shit, yes. Yes. Shit that sells, though. You know, I'm no Taylor Swift but I have a lot of fans and look, I make them happy. That's the purpose of music, right? - I'm not a backup singer. - I don't want a backup singer. I'm going on a little European tour for two months, leaving Friday. On the 4:35 p.m. flight to Barcelona. So?

 How did you get my passport number? I forgot to tell you something. I'm not gonna try to sleep with you. I'm not creepy. Yeah, stop, that's good. What do you think? Yeah, not bad. Shift it to the right a bit, please. Perfect. - Maybe widen up the angle a bit? - How's it going? I know, I know. I'm late. - Hello. - Hello. I was working. You were working? OK. I'm glad this band is a hobby for you. Take it easy. Ignore him. He's just nervous because the guy with the turtleneck is coming. - Franck Lévy? - Yeah. Elliot is still trying to get us a music deal? Yeah, he's still trying to get us a music deal. - Absolutely, yes. - It's a no-brainer. Try it again. ♪ Dupin's blue ♪ ♪ Dupin's blue ♪ ♪ Dupin's blue He won't say a word ♪ ♪ And somebody heard His talking bird ♪ ♪ Never tweets, never eats ♪ ♪ Just repeats The silent treatment ♪ ♪ Dupin's blue, he won't come outside Everybody's tried, he won't confide ♪ ♪ Or say a thing, not happening Lets his phone just ring and ring ♪ - What are you doing here? - Zivko sent me. - What? - I work in the bar. - No. - Hey, hey. - No. - I cost nothing.

But let's be clear, I can only cover part of the cost. That's OK. Profit share is fine by us. Listen carefully. I need you to pay for half the recording. Ten thousand. You think that's possible? - I wish it could be less. - It could be less, Frank. We deserve your full backing. You'll get my full backing. But you know, the fucking Euro... Economics. Yeah, yeah. If you can't get it, no problem. We will be released on your label? You'd be treasured by my label. Give me a smile. See you later. Hello, hello. There she is. You... You were pretty fantastic tonight. You were not there. Not really. Oh, I was there. And you were really, really good. Franck Lévy thought so too. He wants to record us. OK. What's wrong, Maja? I'm trying to understand, what am I doing here? I'll tell you what you're doing here. Singing in a great band, that's what you're doing. You tell me, "Sing the song." I do. You tell me, "Come to Paris." I do. - What are you talking about? - It's my fault. I'm not blaming you. Maja, maybe you didn't understand me. Listen. Hey, hey... Franck Lévy... wants to sign us. Our band. Right? Now, this is good news. Come on, we should go out and celebrate. With some champagne... What are you... What are you doing? Hey. Wait a minute. You're leaving? Yes, I'm leaving. And like I said, I'm not angry with you. I'm angry with myself. I... Hold on. Wait a second, wait a second... Do me a favor. Give this to Julie, please. - Give it to her yourself. - Please. Hi. - You don't sleep? - No, I can't. Just been scrolling. For hours. Looking at hair tutorials. It's from your father. - From my dad? - Mm-hmm. What is it? I'm going to bed. Do you have any weed? - Are you in love with him? - Mm... Big question. Another big question: Are you in love with my father, and what... is your favorite pizza topping? Mushrooms. And... No. Interesting. Do you think he's in love with you? It's kinda weird to think about, 'cause I feel like he doesn't love anybody. So why did you come to Paris? Another big question. I had no choice. And have you been to the Upper East Side? Because it's WASP town, USA. Plus... My dad... needs me. So... You stay here for him? Mmm. Maybe. I will give you some advice. Tell people what you feel. I feel... like mushrooms are a terrible pizza topping. Not if you're high! Damn it! I didn't turn this fucking phone off. What time is it? I woke you. I'm sorry. FaceTime, why? I just wanted to see your face while I repeat my offer. That's... That's creepy. No, no. Not creepy. No worries. So? Why me? You know what it's like to sing the same songs for 30 years? A total bore. But what fascinates me are the musicians I work with. My guitarist, for example, I discovered in a club in Johannesburg. My drummer, I met in Rio. When I find something exciting, I pursue it. I don't want to sleep with you. You know, I'm almost flattered you find me so repulsive. Anyway, you have tomato on your face. Yes, I had pizza last night. Bye-bye. CAPTAIN KEITA Police? - Club reopened. You find my money? - Not yet. Just... We're doing better. Give me time and I'll repay you your 150,000. I have a boss. He don't give a shit about me. - I don't give a shit about you. - Did your boss kill Farid? Hey. Did your boss kill Farid? You have three days. No joke. OK? Last chance. Yeah. - OK? - Yeah. Hey. Hey, just looking to see if my new sticks came. Do you... You know the guy in the car? Which guy in the car? Shit. - It's not what you think. - Oh, no? Did you introduce him to Farid? - Was it you, Katarina? - I was just trying to help. - To help? He's dead. - Zivko had a reputation. It's Farid. He asked me to help him find dealers to work in the club. I thought it's better... Dealers? What are you talking about? You have no idea, do you? No, I don't. Yeah, because you're never here. You were supposed to be his partner. He was drowning. No, don't put this on me. - Don't put this on me. - You think I didn't ask? I said, "Go to Elliot," and he said you can't help. He said you won't help. He was fucking frightened. You couldn't even see this. - You're fired. - Then fuck you! I resign. I'm just asking you to think about it. No, you're telling me to agree. You gave him my passport number? - It's good money. - I'm not a backup singer. Oh, yeah? Unlike Whitney Houston, Sheryl Crow... - John Legend, Cher? - I don't care. Maybe they had no choice. I have choice. Franck Lévy wants to record us. And you know who's paying half the fees? Elliot Udo. You'll never get paid. I didn't know. And, to be perfectly honest, you're not getting any younger. Thank you. OK, listen. You're either the lead singer of a band no one cares about... or the backup singer for one of the most-loved French artists of his time. What's the dilemma? You were having quite a conversation. He's a music producer. Franck Lévy. Are we gonna do this every day? Sorry for wasting your time. I told you it's somebody I don't know who's behind all this, OK? Exactly. That's why we need to eliminate who we can. OK. You want to eliminate, let's eliminate. I know him, know him, know him, know him, don't know him, don't know her. Him, he works with me as a matter of fact. How's that? - When did you start employing new people? - Since we got busy. Well, maybe next time you tell us. I don't see how me hiring somebody, especially a pimply-faced kid, is of any interest to you. OK, let's start over. Tell me who's who. You work with us now. Not the other way around. Yeah. Hey, Randy. Pick one. I love card tricks. It's a new trick. I forget the card! Hey, guys, listen up. Fred is going to join us on the sticks tonight, OK? Ted. - Hmm? - My name's Ted. All right. What's happened with Katarina? Listen, Ted knows the music so we're all good, OK? Is Katarina OK? Yeah, yeah, she's just... She's not feeling too well. But make... make Ted welcome. - Have a good show. - Hi. - Great pants. - Thanks. - You know the music? - Yes. All the songs. Yes. This the one? Randy? Uh... Second round. Evening.

Must have been a long time ago. No, you were extraordinary. I tried to sign you for my next record. I was told I couldn't afford you. You still can't. - Really? - Yeah. Thank you very much. - Is that Daniel Perrin? - I don't know. Maybe. The drummer is a bit enthusiastic. - He's just sitting in. - Really? ♪ Morning comes to the seaside town ♪ Did you write the lyrics? Yes. Nice. It's much better than the jazz I'm used to. It's, uh...

Just kidding, I didn't buy them. They were delivered by a young strapping man who also didn't buy them. But the card said... "You were magical tonight. Daniel." I'm sorry, I opened it. So you're fucking around on my Dad now? So, this, uh... Daniel. He's a fan who sends you flowers? He wants to work with me. - He wants to work with you? - Mmm. You know you're not the first woman who's heard that line, right? I sing. It's all I can do. You're really good. Thank you. You're special. Did you ever see your... dad play? - No. - Huh. He, uh... wanted me to see him when I "understood" and then he quit before the age of understanding could arrive. He was special. When you see really incredible people like Elliot... it can destroy you. Well, I'm not good at anything, so I guess I don't have to worry about that. That's not true either. You know what is true? When you sing... you sing to him. Thank you. - Yes? - Hello, darling! Mom? What are you doing here? That's not the reaction I was expecting. Give me a second. Oh, God! Why are you acting this way? Every time I see you, there's some drama. You show up unannounced and I'm dramatic? I just wanted to see you. I'm supposed to buy that? Why are you really here? - Can I stay on your couch? - No, it's taken. Hmm! The guy who bought you those beautiful flowers? What did you do for him? You can't stay here. We can share a bed. - God... - Like we used to. Because we were evicted and living in a shithole, remember? Where's the piano? I think it was here... Then you sent me to live with your sister, remember? - What happened to the piano? - I sold it! - So... - What? I thought your place was bigger. - It's the same... - Screw it, I'll sleep in the tub. No! Calm down. Sweetheart, I don't want to waste money on a hotel. I've wasted enough on you as it is. I paid your last month's rent. Fuck! How pretty. You can stay, but I leave tomorrow. I hope you'll be gone by then. Wonderful! Let me freshen up, I'll take you out. All right? ♪ The light will imbue ♪ ♪ An indigo hue ♪ ♪ The horn blowing blue ♪ Stop, stop. Stop. Can you handle this?

Who's this new drummer? - He's just here for a few days. And what are you doing? Where is Katarina? I call her, she doesn't answer. Randy call her too, no answer. I fired her. - What? - Mm-hmm. Why? She lied. I'm glad you're here. I need to talk to you about Julie. What did she lie about? I'm not blaming you for this, but I did get a call from the school, saying that Julie disappeared yesterday at lunch time and didn't come back to class until late. Do you know anything about that? No. I had no idea. No idea? She's staying with you, Maja. Please. If you know something, tell me. Why did you fire Katarina? If Julie is not in school, then she's out on the street. If she's out on the street she's not safe. Understand? Are you even listening to me? Katarina is not your business. Not my business? Hey. I'm looking after your daughter, your band. Don't talk to me like that, OK? Please get off my fucking back! Damn it! I've taken a new job. I'm leaving the band. Yeah. Yeah, right. Drummer, singer, both out. Bravo! Hey, you know, you truly pick the best moments, you know that? - What are you punishing me for? - I'm not punishing you. I'm leaving you. You are always, always so fucking superior. Even when you're the one who's late. You're the one who's unprofessional. - You're the one who fucks around. - But you don't care. You don't care! Hey, hey, come here. You won't fuck me, you won't look at me, and I must love you? Come here. Come here. Don't do this. - What am I? - Don't go. What am I to you? You don't love me. You make me feel like shit! Is that white wine? Chardonnay? How about another one? The next one? No need to be scared. I'm scared, I'm scared... Blah-blah-blah... Your problems, my problems. - You just want me to get lost or...? - Yes. - Hey. - Hey. What time is it? I have to tell you something. Mm. OK. Come on. Come on. OK. Your mom is fantastic. My school friends loved her too. She gave them vodka... Drugs... She fucked my boyfriend. That's fucked up. Listen. I have a new job. I'm leaving the band. Leaving Paris. You can stay with Amira. She's happy to have you. I have to do something where I mean something. You're a wonderful girl, Julie. You will be a wonderful woman. I've really liked staying here. I liked to have you stay. I have to take shower. Hey. Hey, what are you doing? - He said you'll understand. - No, no. He said three days. You told him police not watch the club. But I see cameras. You fucking liar! - Are you running from me? - No. - From a guy? - No. - Are you pregnant? - Cut it out. - You always run away... - That's not true. Every fucking time. I always have an excuse to come, and you, to run. Will you kindly explain why you're here this time? Because of a guy. Why are you leaving? You're the one who always told me to leave. I want to make a bit of money, change my life, earn some respect. Because this is a shithole, right? It's a mess. I couldn't tell you much about being respected. - Who will look after your place? - Airbnb. And Mom, I suggest you go home too. Look after yourself, please. I'll look after myself and we'll find some peace. As always... - Sympathetic as always. - You fucking deserve it. - Let go of this grudge! - I have no grudge. - You're not like me, if that's your fear. - Fortunately! - No, you're cold! - Thank God I'm not like you! Pack your bags and leave me all alone, as usual! Your blackmail no longer works on me. Go on, cry! Cry! Let me see. Not this time, I see. Enough, that's enough. I've had enough, fuck. I'm sick of this shithole, of you... of Paris... of everything. You're supposed to dab, not scrub with carpet, usually. Hey. Hey. Shouldn't you be in school? It smells like gas in here. I'm moving. To Amira's. Because Maja's leaving Paris. Did you know about that? She got a job. Some guy named Daniel. Perrin. - He wants her to sing... - Backup. I thought you might want to know that information. You should call her, if you care. And I know you care. Will you come home to me? It's not really about us right now. She's leaving from Orly airport at 4 o'clock. - Today? - Mm-hmm. Probably enough time for you to catch her. It's good to see you again. Yeah, OK. - There you go. - Thank you. Ma'am, the VIP lounge is on your right, after security. - Have a great flight. - Thank you. - Excuse me, sir. - Hello. I'll give you 20 euros to watch my scooter. I can't, sir. I'm working. - Please? - Thirty euros? - Twenty. - OK. Your attention, please. Air France flight 009 from New York JFK expected in Terminal 2E is now transferred to Terminal 2A. I get it. I get it. You don't trust me. But trust this, Maja. I know you. - I know what your talent is worth. - Fuck you! This is me. OK, well then stay for the club, OK? Stay for the band. I don't know what else to do. You, you, you, all the time, all about you. Never honest, never real, just bullshit you. - Help me. - Sorry? Help me! I can't do this without you. And I'm sorry, but I can't do this with you. Listen to me. Every time I touch you, I... I-I-I think of him. It's like all I... all I can think about is him. My son. I can't... feel anything. But... when I couldn't play anymore, I could write for you. And when I came here, that's why I knew I had to have you with me. Now you and I, I don't know what it is. But I know that I can't do it without you. Now, I'm a selfish man. I know that, I admit that. But you, Maja, you... you... You're my hopes, my... my future. You, and Julie, and the band is... I want to do whatever I can to be a part of your future. And it doesn't have to be about sex or whatever, but just... I want us to be... partners. In that future, together. Not good enough? I see you're trying. OK. OK. OK. All right. Well, if you gotta go... At least go somewhere where who you are means something. Because for me, you are extraordinary. Homey! Yo! So? - Your mom told you? - Yes. I got to lend you my bed. Listen, you mess with my underwear... - I'll kill you, understood? - Yes. - Understood? - Understood. Let's go. Hmm... What took you so long? Well, they clamped my bike. - Mm. - Mm-hmm. Extraordinary. You meant it? I meant it. Promise me it will be better. Promise. I don't believe you.
