 Sorry. I need to get Julie off to school. Would you mind? She's confused enough as it is. So can you... Be... invisible? Stay in here until she's gone, all right? She's confused enough as it is. Confusing time for all of us. Hey. You got school. Hurry up. Gotta get out of here. - Hello! - Hey! - How's it going? - Fine. Julie. I didn't want it to be awkward. Yeah, there's nothing awkward about this. How are you feeling? Do you feel awkward? I'm very disappointed in you. - Don't talk to her like that. Let's go. - Don't talk to who, like what? - Talk to who like what? - Let's go. It's time for school. Talk to who like what? I don't see anyone. So weird. You need to cut that out, you understand me? - Well done! - You see what I'm dealing with? I mean, how hard is it to just go to school? Less than a month and already they're threatening to kick her out. - How much school did you do? - I went to enough not to get kicked out. - Be gentle. - I am gentle. I'm always gentle. What? - She's 16. - I know. Her mother abandoned her. And you're her father. Julie, darling? We have an appointment with the principal and we can't be late, OK? I just wanted to see you, you know. I wanted... I didn't even want to talk to you, just see you. I'm getting married. Today. To who? His name is Omar. You have to go. Lots to do, I imagine. Right? Go on. It's a small wedding, you know. We'll find two strangers outside City Hall and pay them a few bucks to be our witnesses. You taking care of yourself? I'm fine. - Are you clean? - You're not allowed to do that anymore. I said I'm fine. Mind your own business, focus on your wedding. Wait, I'm sorry. I have... I have an idea. Could I be your witness? You can't be my witness, don't be silly. And why... why not? Why not? Of course I can. It should be someone you care about. Someone who cares about you. That would be me. What time is this thing? Two o'clock at City Hall in the 12th. Right... See you later. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Good news. They're gonna give you another shot. What? Why? Why? Why? Because I worked it out. Don't look so happy. Wait. What's the condition? There's no condition, Julie. Just show up, that's all. Kids go to school, all right? See? See? Have a good day. I told you to stay away from her. Stay away from her. Hey. I like schoolgirls. Wow! Very nice! Whoa, whoa... I like the dress. - We have a new problem. - We don't have a problem. You have. Farid was hiding counterfeit money for me. - He had 150,000. I need it back. - Hey. I am out of this. Out! You gave the police the face I told you? Yeah, yeah. Because you said it would be over. I lied. So now, if the police catch me, I say you help. You, jail. All done. Understand? I need this money. Counterfeit. Find it today. For your daughter's safety. I go see the... Britney Spears. August 23, 1980. - Please take a seat at desk four. - OK. Thank you. - Hey, Jude. How are you? - Hey. Yeah, fine. Remind me your date of birth? - November 11, 1982. - Thank you. So, metha... OK, 40. Take a seat at desk two and my colleague will bring you your methadone. - Hey, Lola. - How's it going? Don't hesitate. We have consultations to see a doctor if need be. And how are your applications going? Thank you. - Let me have your date of birth. - January 16, 1990. - Hi, how are you? - Fine. Um... I'm having a hard time finding some paperwork. I was wondering if you'd mind if I just... take a look. You want to search my home? Please. That's the kids' stuff. It's the kids'. Jude! - Sorry. - No worries. This is Omar. Jude. I hear you're the best bass player in Paris. - Honored to meet you, Jude. - Pleased to meet you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Shall we? - Yeah. This way, ladies and gentlemen. Elliot, you're scaring me. What are you looking for? What is it? Is this about what we discussed? Elliot, I'm talking to you! Hey, cut it out! What's going on? It's nothing. - It's your fault, or Farid? - It's nothing. It's nothing. In the name of the law, I declare Mr. Omar El-Sayed and Miss Habiba Menad united in marriage. By the power vested in me by the Republic, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Congratulations. You may now kiss the bride. What's up? I didn't want your pretty dress to stink of cigarette. You know... I know that was hard for you. - I'm sorry. - No worries. No worries. Anyway, you looked happy. This morning, I thought you came to see me to... To what? - I don't know... - Stop. Really, there's no point. There's no point? Remember the little blue booties? You told me you were late. That's when I thought maybe it's time to... get clean. And then, that was it. You miscarried. You seemed relieved. That's not true. - You were relieved. - No, I wasn't. Hey. I thought brides ran off before the wedding, not after? I'm right here. - I'm not going anywhere. - Yeah. - I'm not going to run off, OK? - Yeah. - What are you doing now? - Well, we have all day, so we'll see. - We'll go for a stroll... - Where? - I don't know, we'll see. - I have a plan. - No, it's cool, we... - It's a great plan, I swear! - A great plan? - I swear, but you have to come with me. Be my guest. You know that? Shall we? So, is this cool or what? - Yeah. - Honestly, it's beautiful. Oh, yeah! Thank you. - There you go. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Make yourselves at home. - The Eddy! - Hey. Hey! You good, bro? Hello, dude. - All good? - Right on. - Hey, ninja. - You know it. Thanks. Can I sit? Thanks. - Chouquette? - No, thank you. - Sure? - Mm-hmm. They're really good. Freshly baked. I'm good, thank you. Look, over here. Look, quick! Oh, my God, look! That was gross. Don't want to mess up your hair. There you go. There. So how did your dad manage to wrangle you back in? I mean, that was some trick. He kissed someone's ass, probably. I'm guessing it's money. I mean, they go mental here for money. He's broke. Oh. Well, it won't be that, then. What is this part? That's the blues. Oh, my God! Hey, hey, hey! Beautiful people, how we doing? Randy... - What? - You were fucking someone. I saw. OK, it's a day of love, today. - And I'm supporting that. - Who is he? He's some guy. He got us the gig. His name is Quentin. He's a lovely man. And I gave him a present. This is how we get gigs, now? I get gigs however. You got a gig. We got a gig, right? Where's the set list? Um... Forgot to ask. Little busy. - Little? - No, bigger. Bigger. Bigger kind of busy. Let's go. So what are we gonna do, guys? Let's just play our regular wedding song, you know? "Can't Stay Away." - "Can't Stay Away?" - Perfect. ♪ Days go by ♪ ♪ Without you ♪ ♪ I can be discreet ♪ ♪ Never talk about you ♪ ♪ Never miss a beat ♪ ♪ Can't stay away ♪ ♪ For very long ♪ ♪ Can't stay away, stay gone ♪ ♪ I know they say that this is wrong ♪ ♪ I belong Can't stay away ♪ ♪ Days go by ♪ ♪ Without you ♪ ♪ And I can be discreet ♪ ♪ Never talk about you ♪ ♪ Never miss a beat ♪ ♪ Can't stay away ♪ ♪ For very long ♪ ♪ Can't stay away ♪ ♪ Stay gone ♪ ♪ I know they say ♪ ♪ That this is wrong ♪ ♪ I belong ♪ ♪ Can't stay away ♪ Quentin!

Sure. - Can you do it now, please? - Yes, I have the list. That's enough elevator music. Randy, can you stick to the set list, please? "Mika." We gotta play Mika. "Elle me dit." Hey, yo. I'll take the verse. Come on! Come on, people! Come on, guys, come on down! Jude! Thanks for coming. The woman. It was Habiba? Are you OK? I'm always OK. The club will be open soon. Everything will go back to normal, you'll see. Hey, your money. Jude! Take care. INTERNATIONAL CAMPUS - See you soon, OK? - Yeah. - "No condition"? - What? "No condition"? - What are you talking about? - A big check from Mom? - Let's go. - I don't know what's worse. That Mom threw her money at you because she doesn't want to deal with me, or that you took it. Now is not the time. Get on the bike. Let's go. How much was it? Hmm? How much did you donate? Dad? Dad! How much of Mom's money did you take, for them to keep me? Hmm? Come on, right? You wanted to stay in Paris, right? Paris... No. Who is that? - Your invisible girlfriend? - Please. Yeah. Yeah, Sim. I'll come down. Sim? - Sim is here? - Yeah. - He has to pick up a guitar. - Why? He's a musician, Julie. Musicians need their instruments. Hey. Come on in. - You good? - Yeah, yeah. It's just in here. Hey. - Dad, can we talk, please? - Guitar's over there. How much did she give you to keep me away from her? Hello? Are you gonna answer me? - Hey! - Can we talk? Please? What are you doing? This is all too much, Julie. You've been unhappy since you got here. You don't like the club, home, school... You don't seem to like anything, so you know what? Maybe the best thing is to go back with your mother. Maybe she can do a better job. 'Cause clearly I am not the person you need in your life right now, OK? So you're giving up on me? I'm not giving up. I want you to try. That's all I'm asking. Fucking try. Please! Watch your language. You want me to try, but you won't go to school? - You won't even go? - I don't want to go to fucking school! You know what... - I'm not made for school! - I can't do this. I wish you could try to get to know me, then you could know that! You know what? I'm done with this. - What are you done with? - All of this! How do you think it makes me feel to have to beg your mother for money to get you back into school? I don't give a fuck how it makes you feel. Exactly. And that's the problem. You don't care. You don't care about anything except you. That's it. That's all you ever cared about, is yourself. - You're selfish. - No, Dad, that's you. Where the fuck do you think I got that from? That's you. Because you don't give a fuck. Watch your mouth, you understand me? - There are bigger things going on. - You never cared how I feel! Much bigger things. - What did you say? - I said there are bigger things at play. That's what I said. "Bigger things?" Bigger things? Oh, my fucking God! Oh, my God! - Bigger things! - Hey, hey! Hey, hey! You calm down. Fucking stop it! Let her go. What do you think you're doing? That's enough. That is enough, OK? Cut it out. Cut it out. Cut it out. What are you playing at? Julie! Julie! Mr. Udo, where are you going? What's going on? Come on. You get inside. Get inside now, OK? Why did you lie about the guy on avenue de Saint-Ouen? You know murder gets you at least 15 years? You got nothing to say? OK, buddy, we'll see about that. Hey, Julie! Hey! - Julie, listen to me. - Leave me alone. Fuck off. Leave me alone. What's going on, Agnès? I found myself a nice American boyfriend! - OK, whatever. Olivier! - He's so sexy. - His name is Elliot and he's my boyfriend! - Can you deal with her? Yeah, OK, calm down. Come on, pronto! Let's go find your boyfriend in the drunk tank. Sorry about that. Did she bother you? I googled you. You're famous. A very good musician. I need to get this club back open, and I know you're the one that's keeping it closed. The man you gave us was not in Paris on the day you said you saw him. And his DNA was not on Farid's body. Your DNA was also not on his body. Martin, can you hand me the files, please? Forensics indicate a gang hit. These are the kids killed in the projects last year. - Please. - Look! This one must be 14 years old. And I can't catch the killers, OK? Because no one gives a shit. So, your case, Farid... will allow me to get started, to understand what's going on. I can reopen your club. Tonight, if I want to, OK? I'm willing to help you. But I need your help too. If you reopen, they'll try to clean up their mess. So, I need cameras in your club. I want to know what's going on. I need intel on who's coming and going. You want to put cameras inside my club? No, I want you to tell me everything and let us put cameras inside your club. Otherwise I'm afraid the 28 days will be extended. Hey. We're offering you a way out. Think about it carefully. You need to understand, you need to say yes. We need those cameras. Hey, you've reached Julie. I probably won't listen to this. You deserve your reputation. It's true, I enjoyed your band. When you're on stage... And I'm not a jazz fan, you can ask her, but that... We don't usually play that stuff. I'll be right back. Why did you need to see me? Why did you need to dig all that up? Because... You're right. I did feel relieved. We couldn't have done it. We weren't ready, Jude. I was happy it was... a false alarm. I was too afraid. You're a mess when you're not playing music. And I can't deal with that. I loved you. I love you. I love you, you know. Forgive me. I'm sorry. I know, I shouldn't have. It was cruel. Forgive me. Please forgive me. Forgive me. Jude... Jude, forgive me. I'm all alone. But not forever. Please wipe your tears. All good? - All right, let's do this! - Go for it! For the lady! All right! ♪ La, la-la la, la-la la ♪ ♪ La, la-la la, la-la la ♪ Let's do it! Yeah! Bravo! PUBLIC RESTROOMS You really like talking to the police, huh? I don't have the money but I'll get it. You look in his house? Yeah, it's not there. It'll be in the club. - Once I get it re-opened I'll find it. - Why it's closed? - Why closed? - Noise violation. Hey, Jude, it's not a good time, OK? What? OK, wait there. I'm on my way. I'll burn your club, man. I'll burn your fucking club, you understand? I burn your fucking club! Jude? Hey, Jude. It's me. - Take that shit away from me! - OK, OK. OK. Hey, hey... Hey. Hey! It's OK. Look at me. Look at me... It's OK. It's all right. You hear me? This is not fair. This is not life. This is not the life you always think when you are a kid, man. - Jude, hey. Listen to me. - It's not fair. Look at me. You are brilliant, brother. No, you are. You're brilliant. You're everything every musician strives to be. You hear me? You hear me? I don't have money. I don't have a house. I have nothing. - I have nothing. I have nothing. - You've got us. You got me. Wait here. I'll be right back. Yes, it's Elliot Udo. I'll do it. OK. - We're on for the cameras. - No way. Good job! You hate me? No. I have nowhere to go. Can I stay with you? Sure. Come in. Mm-hmm. Does she seem OK? Are you sure? OK. Thank you, Maja. Thank you for your help. You and Julie? Not good. Glad I'm the one you called. - Really? - Yeah. I think I needed it. I needed it too, man. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
