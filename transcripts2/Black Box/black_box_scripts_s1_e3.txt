 Previously on "Black Box"... If anyone has a medical condition that can harm patients, they must come forward. This is a firing offense. You know, I can't stop thinking about last time. [Both breathing heavily] It will never happen again. Reagan: You can't call her when you're manic or depressed. You're supposed to be the grown-up. She's my daughter. You have somewhere else to turn for love and support.

 If we love each other, we can deal with the truth. I slept with someone in San Francisco. [Sizzling, utensil tapping] [Utensil scrapes] [Sizzling, tapping, scraping continue] [Pills rattle] [Bottle thuds] Oh. I don't deserve this. You don't. You cheated on me in San Francisco. But I'm glad you told me the truth. I'm staying on these. Good.

 I want to know how they work. What is this? Oxcar... Oxcarbazepine. It's, um... [bottle opens, pills rattle] It's used for epilepsy. You'll see. Sometimes, um, prescribed for mood disorders. You know what lithium is? This one... [Chuckles] Helps with the mania. What about olanzapine? It's an antipsychotic. Sometimes used for tourette's. For me... [pills rattling] Musical hallucinations. - Do you have those? - Mm-hmm. Hmm. [Sighs] I'm gonna miss them. [Chuckles] You know, but the meds... they can, um... They can numb me, you know? Sometimes it's hard to concentrate. But do they change who you are? No. They allow me to be me. [Glass thuds] Without the crazy, which is a good thing... mostly. Mmm. [Chuckles] This is incredible. Okay. Which is the real Catherine... The unmedicated or the medicated? You know who I am... Just as well as I know who you are. Really? Yeah. You think you know me that well? Well, I think so. Know that new hostess at the restaurant... Delilah? Young, pretty? Very young. She's 20. Very pretty. Sexy. I slept with her. Synced by emmasan www.addic7ed.com [Siren wailing, indistinct shouting] We're here waiting for Gabriella Mozza. [Camera shutters clicking] Hey! Come on! What about the baby?! Hey! What about the baby? [Shouting continues] Is the baby gonna pull through?! Let them through! - Gabriella! Gabriella! - Let's get the cameras. Paramedic: 32-year-old pregnant woman, 36 weeks gestation. Lost consciousness due to choking on food. She has a head injury. Witnesses say she hit her head on the floor. The Heimlich wasn't done because the wife is pregnant. The husband was afraid it would hurt the baby. Stand back! Let them through! Gabriella! Gabriella! Lina: What was going on down there? Dr. Bickman performed an emergency cricothyroidotomy on a world-famous opera singer during breakfast at the Carlyle Hotel... With a steak knife. Anyone seen Gabriella Mozza? She'll need surgery for the head injury. They rushed her into the O.R., Dr. Bickman. And he didn't use the Heimlich maneuver because...? - Maybe she had previous chest injuries. - No. He didn't use the Heimlich because it's not flashy enough to get him on TMZ. The man is a publicity whore. Who? Bickman? My God. Loves his P.R. Have you seen the amount of press outside? Jabbing a steak knife into somebody's throat for P.R.'S sake? Wait. He did what? He's... he's a gifted surgeon. He's a psychopath, which, frankly, is not all that surprising. A huge percentage of neurosurgeons are functional psychopaths. They have to be because of how many patients they kill. He saved that woman's life. He's a hero. You know, if you want to know whether or not Bickman is really a dreamboat or a clinically deranged psychopath, you should test him. - [Gasps] The RPTC? - Yep. I love it. I'm in. - The what? - The Rosengard psychopath traits checklist. It's a list of personality traits used to assess whether or not somebody is, indeed, a psychopath, but if you ask me this morning... All men are. [Pen light clicks] [Door opens] - Both pupils are equal and reactive to light. - [Door closes] Now, Mrs. Temko, can you stand up for me? Um, yeah. Hello. I'm Dr. Black. Hi. Maddy. Her daughter. All right, I want you to walkin a straight line towards me, heel to toe. Great. The patient had an idiopathic syncopal event, Dr. Black. EKG, TTE, and CMP were all negative. Hi, Mona. Hi. So, what this means is that you fainted and we don't know why. So, I see it happened this morning at a zumba? Yes. That's my dance and fitness regime. It's a... a combination of hip-hop and salsa and merengue. Very, very invigorating. Mom. What? Oh. She's always criticizing my style... Although her father, my ex-husband, remarries a 27-year-old, and I'm the one who needs to be reminded to act her age. She also had a car accident the other day. She drove into a wall. It was the parking garage at Neiman's. There was a sale. People were driving crazy. Do you know today's date, Mona? Oh, yeah. It is "D" day. Tomorrow's her birthday. Well, happy birthday. 39. Wow, you look fantastic. But I'd like to send you for a C.T., just to be on the safe side, okay? All right, well, as long as it doesn't take too long. I have a lot of organizing to do. I'm throwing myself a party. Somebody's got to. Well, we'll have you out of here in no time, okay? Leo, will you take Mona down to radiology, please? This way. Ian: Gabriella Mozza. Small subdural hematoma, about 6 millimeters, no midline shift. She probably won't need surgery, but we'll monitor her ICP. Did you know, she hit her head when she fell? Really cracked the sucker. Should have heard it. Mm, the poor husband. Carlotta said he's been sitting by his wife's bed, crying. I'm not really an opera fan. It's pretty much the one genre of musicthat doesn't do anything for me. I need to go scrub. Cold-hearted and lacking empathy. Check. Who's the hottie? Hey. I'm on my way to get results from the C.T. and blood work you ordered. Okay. Let me know straightaway. How random that the life you spectacularly saved today happened to be Gabriella Mozza. Well, she's lucky I was there. Oh, I'm sure if she pulls through, you'll be the first to tell her. Thank you. What were you doing at the Carlyle at 7:00 A.M., anyway? Sex life... Impersonal, trivial, and poorly integrated. Check. [Door closes] Reagan? They told me I could wait in here. Is everything okay? Has something happened? Everyone's fine. No. I came to tell you that... I'm lifting the ban on you and Esme seeing one another. Oh, thank you. You don't know how much this means to me. Conditionally. Esme has an assignment from her new school. She has to create a video documentary that serves as a self-portrait. Her, uh, premise statement is, "at 15, my own self is mutable. My identity comes from my family." She's so smart. She's already interviewed me and Josh, and she'd like to include you. It's very kind of you to allow it. As long as you don't undermine me. I won't. I'd never. I'm so grateful. Good. So... Here's my condition. She idolizes you. Me, she judges. No. She's a teenager. They're always toughest on the ones they love most. Appreciate you saying that. What I want is for you to work harder to make it clear to her who I am... Her... real... Her... only... Mother. Understood. Oh, completely. Oh, shall we dance? I'm sorry. I, uh... I just had some good news. I'm sorry I'm not a better dancer. I-I think I might have more good news for you, though. Mona Temko... The blood work and C.T. are both normal, except for this... A tiny region of hypodensity in the right parietal lobe. It's nonspecific. Okay, this is not good news. I was hoping for a diagnosis. Mm. Her daughter thinks it's a stress reaction. She's turning 50 tomorrow, trying to look 30. I bet she just can't deal with getting old. Okay, I find that insulting, especially coming from a younger woman. Touchy. I am a younger woman, sure, but... No, not you! Her daughter. Anyway, you're barely younger than me. Mm. Eight years. That's just short of a decade. But, I mean, like, who's counting, you know? I'm not. Are you calling me old? I'm teasing you. You ever heard of it? It's a highly technical term for when one person playfully needles another, - no malice or... - Oh, whatever. I just hope that I look as good as Mona Temko when I'm 50. That's all I'm saying. Since we're already in the city, we might as well pick up the cake. We'll save on the delivery charges. Excuse me. Can you just sign here? [Sighs] And if we could find a nurse, I would really love a little something for my headache. Mom, she's right here. Just sign here, and I'll find you some Tylenol. I really think you should cancel this party. You are not well. Do not make me out to be a crazy person, Madeline. Your father used to do that to me. Mom, you're supposed to sign on the line, here. Where is that nurse? Oh. Um... I'm sorry. Oh, my. Poor girl. Could you imagine going through life with a face like that? Can we go now? Mom, the elevator. Mom. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Kate: So, the point of our study is to investigate the cause of capgras delusion. So, what is capgras? Capgras delusion is a disorder in which a person believes, with unshakeable conviction, that a friend, spouse, parent, or other close family member has been replaced with an identical-looking imposter. Correct. And, Ali, you're gonna be doing the intake. So, what does intake involve? Well, um, first I need to screen the participants to rule out disorders with similar symptoms. And the differential diagnosis is...? Um... Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, multiple sclerosis... - TBI. - TBI. Substance-induced delusional disorders, and also mood disorders with delusions such as mania and dementia. Okay. And now, what is Lina doing? Ali? She's... hooking up a cool-looking imaging device for the study. That's right. [Intercom beeps] Lina, what is your cool-looking device? This is the omore, an optical scanning device that uses infrared light to map the subject's brain activity so we can watch what happens when the fusiform face area becomes disconnected from the amygdala. Took the words right out of my mouth. [Chuckles] [Intercom beeps] You are a nerd. [Heartbeat] Pratt, all I need you to do is monitor the fetus while I fix the bleed in the mom's brain. Clear? I got it. Do your thing. The fetus's vitals are stable. Good. Drill? If we can relieve the pressure on Gabriella's brain, with any luck, she can carry this baby to term. I'm inserting the drill. How many weeks until the baby's due? It's viable now, so I can do a C-section if necessary. Not necessary. We're here to fix the mom's bleed. That's the priority. I'm inserting an EVD to monitor the ICP. How fast should we run her I.V. Fluids, Dr. Bickman? Restrict the fluids. No more fluids. Too much can make her brain swelling worse. That's the opposite of what I'm trying to do here. But the systolic is down. Did you hear what I just said, Pratt? Giving her more I.V. fluids would be dangerous. I disagree. I'm thinking about the baby. - We need to start a fluid challenge, stat. - [Rapid beeping] She's spiking. Nimrod, what you're doing is gonna harm the mother. I'm not losing the baby! Pud-whack, if her pressure goes up any more, that baby will have a vegetable for a mother. Now get this douche bag out of my O.R. So I can save both of them. Get off me! Get away from me! Draining cerebral spinal fluid. You know, in 25 years as head of obstetrics in this hospital, I've never been called a nimrod, pud-whack, or a douche. __ [Heartbeat, steady beeping] [Rapid beeping] You got to be kidding me. Man: The EFM is showing recurrent late decelerations, Dr. Bickman. All right, page nimrod. Get him back here to do an emergency C-section. Woman: Dr. Pratt, please report back to the O.R. Dr. Pratt to the O.R., stat. Dr. Pratt, please report back to the O.R. Dr. Pratt to the O.R., stat. - [Rapid beeping] - Man: B.P.'S dropping. Dr. Bickman, the fetus is becoming acidemic. Dr. Pratt, please report back to the O.R. Dr. Pratt to the O.R., stat. Ian: All right, we're gonna have to do this. Prep her. I'm sure Dr. Pratt will be in here any minute. Clean the abdomen. Scalpel. Dr. Bickman, I really think you should wait. Dr. Pratt, please report back to the O.R. Dr. Pratt to the O.R., stat. [Rapid beeping continues] [Squishing] [Baby crying] Ah. That, to me, looks like a boy child. Record that Dr. Bickman delivered a viable, four-weeks-premature infant. Noted. Condition of mother... stable. [Monitor beeping, baby crying] Man: Stop procedure. Hank: A neurosurgeon performing a C-section unsupervised?! Oh, you're insane. You are insane, taking such a risk, Bickman. Ian: Oh, come on. It's only childbirth. It's not brain surgery. [Soft jazz music playing] [Indistinct conversations] Hi. You're a friend of Will's, right? I think I've seen you here before. Actually, I'm his girlfriend. Oh. Dr. Black. Delilah. I know exactly who you are. Hey. [Utensils clatter] So? What was that? Marking my territory. So, I guess we're even. Even? Seems like I don't know you as well as I thought, huh? [Chuckles lightly] It's a good thing you can keep surprising me. Well, let me tell you something else. I could live with a few less surprises. Ali: Anna Garcia and Claire Tymoschuk? You must be Claire. - I'm Anna. - Uh, I'm... Claire. No. She's not. Uh, well, thank you both for volunteering to take part in our research study on Capgras syndrome. I'm thinking that Anna's the one diagnosed with the syndrome? Brilliant deduction. [Chuckles] I see you two were married in September of last year. Congratulations on that. Uh, can I ask for a little background on Anna's diagnosis? Well, for starters, we have LBD. LBD, is that a disease of some kind? LBD is "Lesbian bed death". Oh, uh... "Lesbian bed death, a phenomenon said to occur between lesbians "wherein their sex life ceases over the course of a long-term relationship." - All you do is cuddle. - Mm. Um, I'm sorry to hear that. But what does that have to do with... Um, a little while ago, Anna was in a skiing accident in Telluride. She suffered a mild concussion that lasted for a couple of hours. [Inhales deeply] Weirdly, it cured our LBD. We now have, like, totally hot sex pretty regularly, which is great, except... Anna's been getting really upset because she thinks she's cheating on me. Since she doesn't think I'm Claire, she believes she is having casual sex with a stranger. Capgras delusion. She doesn't believe you're Claire, - even though you look just like her. - That's not Claire. I know my own wife, and that woman is an imposter. [Indistinct conversations] [Sighs] Just tell me when you're rolling. Uh... First, stop snapping the rubber band. It's a nervous habit. I'm gonna point it out every time I see you do it. [Camera whirls] Uh... rolling. [Camera beeps] I am standing in front of the neurological research and treatment center, known as the Cube, where my aunt, Dr. Catherine Black, is the director. She's been called the Marco Polo of the brain. She's pretty awesome. My aunt's a role model for me. [Indistinct conversations] Hi. Hey. So happy to see you. - Reagan. - Hey. - You look amazing. - So do you. I-I love this shirt. - It is so cool. - You're sweet. They make me dress up for work. Reagan? Is it all right if you pick her up around noon? I've arranged for some colleagues to speak with her. Yeah. Make sure to do what we talked about. Have the person you're interviewing - restate the question for the camera. - Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll pick you up before lunch. [Smooches] Come on. Thank you. Okay, so... The first person you're gonna interview is Dr. Owen Morely, okay? - He was my mentor and first teacher... - Oh, come on! No paparazzi! How's my hair? Kate: This is my niece, Esme. Esme, this is Dr. Bickman. He's our new ob/gyn. Enchanted. [Smooches] [Giggles] Well, if you lovely ladies will excuse me. [Whistling] Hey! Esme: Whoa. Uh... that's... that's kind of freaky. Okay, sweetie, you can't video my patients. Mona: Dr. Black. Dr. Black? I-I really need your help. So, we're gonna start with a few very simple tests. I want you to copy each of those three drawings. That's all. Hemispatial neglect. The patient insists that she copied each of these drawings exactly. Mona has lost perception of the left side of her world, and she's unaware of the absence. It simply doesn't exist for her. I also asked her to copy this. So, she knows that there are supposed to be 12 numbers. Her brain compensates and puts them all on the right-hand side. This is how she sees the world. We did a C.T. We have two images, one from presentation and one more recent image. Her original screening head C.T. was nonspecific. This new one with contrast shows a moderate-sized ring-enhancing lesion in the right parietal lobe. It's impinging on the temporal parietal junction, and it's caung the hemispatial neglect, but what is the lesion? Well, that's what we don't know. It could be a primary brain tumor. It could be a metastasis. It could be an infection. That's why I'm holding off on biopsy. Any functional impact? Okay, so, this is a video taken on her 50th birthday party. She only blew out the candles on the right side. She also had a car accident the other day. She drove into the left side of a parking-garage entrance. And when she arrived at the Cube today, this is how she presented. So, as you can see, she's decompensating. All right, we need to find out what this lesion is. Ali: Okay, so, Dr. Lark is attaching omore, a helmet rigged with fiber-optic cables that'll let us map Anna's brain activity while you talk to her. This is a two-way mirror. You can see Anna, but she can't see you, but when I signal, she can hear you. Come on. [Intercom beeps] Um... Anna, it's... it's me. Anna: Claire. Uh... where are you, baby? Look. There's change in her amygdala when she hears her voice without seeing her face. [Exhales sharply] That's Dr. Black's theory. What's happening? The part of Anna's brain that recognizes faces is out of touch with the part that processes emotions. So, she can still recognize you by your voice, but it all goes haywire when she sees your face. Just keep talking to her. You'll see. [Intercom beeps] Anna, it's... it's Claire. - Do you know me? - Of course I know you. You're my wife. But where are you? I'm... I'm right here. I'm... [intercom beeps] No, don't go in there. Claire: I am right here, baby. [Door opens] Get away from me. Claire, where are you? I heard you. I heard you. Come back. Okay, wait. No. It's a good thing because... What could possibly be good about having your wife look you in the face and not know who the hell you are? No, I know. Claire, please come back. Claire, where are you? [Door slams] Come back. [Breathes deeply] Can I pet your dog? This is not my dog. He looks exactly like my dog... Same hairdo, same collar, same bushy tail. But I know my dog, and this is not Marvin. - He's an imposter. - [Dog whining] Honey, I'm so sorry. I've been working. Oh, that's okay. Um, I interviewed a lot of your colleagues. I got some great stuff. You did? Good. Well, you better go. Your mom's gonna be waiting. It's 12:00. I do not know you. [Dog growls softly] I don't get it. What is it exactly that makes that man not recognize his dog? So, there's a part of the brain. It's called the fusiform gyrus. It's, uh, what connects what we see to how we feel. So, if that's damaged, you might recognize a face, but you don't have the emotions that you usually have when you see that person, so it makes you think that they're an imposter, okay? So, "my mother is not my mother." Maybe I have that. - I always have that feeling. - What do you mean? My mother's not my mother. I think maybe I was adopted. Wait. You listen to me. I watched your mother stay up with you all night when you were 2 years old and you had croup. I listened to her agonizeabout where to send you to kindergarten. I heard her worry about you and talk about you with all the love in the world. There is no one that matters more to her than you. Okay? And one day, when you're older, you're gonna remember all the things that she did for you, and you will know beyond a shadow of a doubt that she is your mother. - Okay. [Chuckles] - Okay. Thanks. Okay. Thank you. [Both speaking indistinctly] This one's from your zumba classmates. "We hope your day is perfect, "full of comfort, "pillows plumped, all relaxed, "with furry prayers and wishes made just for you. Get well soon." "'R' day. Fort umped." "Fort umped." "'R' you." Hmm. [Sighs] How is she? - Can I talk to you? - Yeah. It's getting worse. Look at her. She was sweating all night. She has a fever of 102. All the tests we've done so far are inconclusive, but now we're gonna do a biopsy. This is why I've asked the head of neurosurgery, Dr. Bickman, to... Mona? Hmm? You have to go to her right. Mona. Ian. Hi. How are you? Why didn't you tell me you were here? I didn't know this was your hospital. Wait. You two know one another? Oh, we met through the neighborhood coalition. He has been to every one of our shelters. Shelters? Yeah, the neighborhood coalition is a network of homeless shelters. Mona: He is one of our most devoted volunteer doctors. He is our angel. A homeless shelter? You? We have our big event coming up in a month. You are gonna be there, right? Wait. You... you spend time in a homeless shelter? - See? She can't believe that I... - No, no, no, not you. Mona. Tuberculosis. It's... It's endemic in the homeless population. We need to do a lumbar puncture and then place a PPD. Mona, I'm testing you for tuberculosis. I am willing to bet that this mass in your brain... It's a tuberculoma. - Isn't that really serious? - No. It can be. It can be if it's left untreated, but TB Is treatable. I owe you lunch. [Indistinct conversations] Kate: [Sighs] So, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. What's that? You failed Lina's test. - What test? - The RPTC. Turns out you're not a psychopath after all. They usually don't volunteer in homeless shelters. - Man: And with taramosalata. - Thanks so much. Catherine. What a funny coincidence. Do you work around here? Yes, she does. Oh. - Hey. - Hi. Isn't she the, uh, pretty girl I saw on your phone? Y-you have a picture of me on your phone? No, no, no. She was looking at your bio page on some restaurant website. Was she really? Huh. I'll bring you your lunch. Okay. What the hell are you doing here? Uh, I'm getting some lunch. Why? At a university campus? From a food truck that happens to be right where I work? I-I don't get your point. [Chuckling] You don't get... Running into me is no accident. This coming from a woman who's Internet-stalking me? You're paranoid. No, I'm perceptive. What I see is a stupid little girl trying to turn a one-night stand into a lot of trouble. What one-night stand? Oh, you mean with Will. Uh, that was a lot more than that. I mean, it's not just anybody you can do it with for hours and hours and again and again and ag... [Gasps] [Exhales sharply] You're crazy. Maybe I am. Don't come near me again. Not a problem. What are you doing up still? I had a little visit from your favorite waitress today. And you threw a smoothie at her. She deserved it, okay? She started to tell me in great detail how the two of you got it on. Yeah, I spoke with her, and that's not what she said happened. And you believe her? [Glass thuds] You believe her over me? Is that what's happening here? Did you take your meds today? - Come on. Calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down. I'm not crazy. I'm not off my meds. And don't ever, ever ask me that. Okay. Now, you cheated on me, and now you're defending the girl that you cheated with. You cheated first. Remember that. - I retaliated. - I wasn't myself. I didn't do it to hurt you. You did it deliberately to hurt me, on purpose. And you can't handle it. You can't handle me. I can handle you. Stop it! - I can handle you fine. - Will. I can. You know why? [Sighs] Because I know you. I know what you want. I know what you need. And I'm not going anywhere. [Breathing heavily] You're still here. I love you. Who? You. I love you. One second. [Exhales sharply] Mm. Really? Yeah. - You want it? - [Chuckling] Yes. I said yes. [Chuckles] Don't ever take it off. I won't. Oh. Yes? - These are for Mrs. Browning. - Okay. Mona: What is he doing now? We want to start the treatment as soon as possible. That's why we're performing the lumbar puncture... Just to confirm the mass is a tuberculoma. - And that's important? - Yes, very. The drugs to treat TB can cause permanent liver damage, so we don't want to administer them without a diagnosis, all right? It's okay. Hold my hand. Ian: Now, Mona, hold still. Oh, God. [Vomits] All right. Get her upright! Help me out! [Groaning] All right, Mona. [Shakily] I'm seeing two. I-I'm seeing two of everything! Okay. It's all right. I've got you. Okay. [Shivering] All right, she's cross-eyed. It's not good. Uh, get a head C.T. Check her osmolar gap. Give her mannitol. We need an EVD in her, stat. Man: Right away. Okay, gurney now! - Owen: What's happening? - She's crashing she has a sixth cranial nerve palsy, - cranial pressure from her lesion. - Can we tap her? If we try, she may develop transtentorial herniation. She could die. Okay, we got to start treatment for TB right now. Wait. Without a firm diagnosis, that's a lawsuit waiting to happen. We've got to do it now. Are you overruling me? No. I'm just hoping that you're gonna come around to my decision. That's all. [Mona shivering, groaning] Mrs. Temko's awake, and her vitals are stable. - Her PPD? - Checked it this morning... 15 millimeters. You were right. It was TB. - Fine? You gonna eat it? - Fine. I will have a bite of it. Okay. Ah. Mm. It's terrible. It's good. I eat this stuff all the time. How are you? Well, I would be doing a lot better if my daughter wasn't making me eat pudding. Might as well just apply it directly to my thighs. - We're getting you back on your feet, mom. - Okay. Okay, well, the good news is that we're treating the TB. We're gonna get this thing under control. You'll be able to get back to your exercise routine before too long. Thank you. So, she's definitely improving, but she still isn't fully using the left side of her body. Okay, well, we're looking into finding a rehab facility for her. But because your mom's kept herself in such great shape, she stands an excellent chance of making a full recovery. Mona: I can see you both fine. Do not talk about me like I'm not here. Have I mentioned that I love you? I love you, too, baby. Kate: Hey, I heard there was a problem. Is everything okay? Anna: Ali fixed it. Claire: Yeah. We understand that there's no cure for Capgras, but, um, now we've found a way to live with it. Ali: Thanks for joining our research project. - No, thank you. - Thank you. Claire: Close your eyes before you turn around. I got you. Okay. What did you do? Ali took a page from the Dr. Black book, figured out how to make the problem into a solution. See, Claire and Anna had two issues... The Capgras and lesbian bed death. I realized you could use one to solve the other. Go on. You know how some people really get off on illicit sex? Yeah. Well, apparently, Claire and Anna have super-hot sexual love when Anna thinks she's cheating on Claire with a stranger. And voila... no more LBD. And when Anna hears Claire's voice without actually seeing her face, she recognizes Claire as her loving, devoted wife. So, they can totally have their cake and eat it, too. So to speak. [Chuckles] Well done. You helped them live with a problem that's not yet curable. That... that is a rare skill. Ready? Yeah. Is this your documentary? Yeah. Yeah, you should see the stuff about Auntie Kate. My day at the Cube was amazing. Don't forget your sheet music. Uh, mom. Where'd you get that shirt? I thought you'd like it. [Laughs] Not on you! Look, I'm sorry. You can't really pull off that kind of thing at all. Just take it back. Seriously. It's kind of embarrassing. [Exhales sharply] I think you look hot.
