 Previously on Black Box... Man: I'm honored tonight to introduce "The Marco Polo of the brain", Dr. Catherine Black. I study extraordinary brains so I can learn about normal ones. Normalizing does not doom you to mediocrity. It allows you to live long enough to do your best work. I'm bipolar. We can deal with it. I have a tendency to go off the meds. I've been wanting to meet you ever since I read your first book.

 Nice to meet you too. Party time. - Aah! - Stop. - Come on. You're not yourself. - Yes, I am. I came to apologize to you. You and Esme are gonna take a break. You are a kind, intelligent, normal guy. Maybe I'm not as normal as you think. What you did to me that night... I liked it. And I want to do it again. Let's see. What else do we need? ♪ ba, ba-ba ba-ba-ba, ba-ba, ba ♪ - Honey, can you please sit down? - * ba, ba-ba *

 Oliver, I need you to sit down, honey, or I'm gonna tell your mom... Oliver, that's not very nice! Do not throw food, okay? - No, let me go! - [Cellphone rings] I want peanut butter! I want peanut butter! Oh, hello, Mrs. Frank. Where are you? Carrie, Oliver has a play date in half an hour. Uh, well, w-we're still at the market, ma'am. - Does he have his sweater on? - He sure does. We need eggs, the free-range ones with extra omegas. He can't stand in the cart. He has to sit. Carrie, he can't stand in the cart. - That's very dangerous. - Oh, he's... He's not standing in the cart. No, no, no! I do not like what I'm hearing, Carrie. Please put Oliver on the phone. Oliver, your mom wants to talk to you, honey. Oliver! Oliver, that is not very nice! Oliver! [Singsong voice] You can't catch me! Na na na-na-na. Oliver! Come back here! That's not funny! Oliver, come back here this instant! Oliver! Where are you?! Boy, you are in so much trouble! Oliver! Oliver, come back here this instant! Oliver, where are you?! Ol... [Train rattling] Synced and corrected by biamussolin www.addic7ed.com Oh. Hey. Aah! Hey, that hurt. Wasn't that the point? It's not what I want. [Sighs] Like this, okay? And like this. [Grunts] Stop it. Will! [Sighs] [Sighs] I did this. What? I ruined it... what we had. Hey, hey, it's okay. Come on. We're just playing. Well, not that game. This... this is what I want. This is what I need so much. I love you no matter what... But I don't understand who you are. Please don't say that. We've been together almost a year. You kept secrets. You lied. You never showed me a whole side of you. I didn't want to lose you. I'm still here... But if there are any more secrets, other things you're hiding from me... You told me when you go off your meds, sometimes you do very bad things. What happened in San Francisco? Will, leave it. Why can't we be completely honest? If we love each other, we can deal with the truth. What I can't deal with, is lies. Were you unfaithful to me in San Francisco? [Moaning] [Panting] No. But I could have been. When you're manic, you can become hypersexual. It's part of that fire in your brain, and when I'm in that headspace, I can't control it. But what you need to know is, that person isn't me. This is who I am. So, you lied to him again? Of course I did. I didn't want to hurt him. And you plan to go on lying? Is there a woman alive who wouldn't have lied in that moment? How often do you lie? Hourly. So do you. So does everyone. "You know what? I love your haircut." "You haven't changed a bit." "That dress, it's beautiful." Relationships are built on trust. Without truth, there's no trust. Without trust, there's no love. It's a nice theory, but here's mine. Relationships are built on love, sustained by constant, mutual affection, attention, and respect buoyed on a cloud of puffy, little white lies. For example? "Yes, I had an orgasm." I think that's a dangerous lie. Sit down. [Sighs] Do you lie to me? No. That could be a lie. It could be... but it's not. - How would I know? - 'Cause you're the one person who knows everything. You're the only person I want to know everything. So, you showed the worst you had to will to find out if he can join our... little circle of trust. No, I showed him because I'm an emotional, impulsive, self-destructive lunatic. [Voice breaking] And if I could take it back, I would in a heartbeat. I got to go. - I still have another half-hour. - I know. I got to be back at the cube. I should have rescheduled, but, you see, I-I-I need a tune-up. - A tune-up? - The meds. I need to re-balance. You can see how I am. How are you sleeping? Barely. See, I was just thinking a... Sprinkling of zolpidem... A soupcon of quetiapine. Mnh-mnh. You're maxed out already on both. I want you to try behavioral changes first. You cut out the coffee. Get to sleep at a regular time every night. Get more aerobic exercise. You know, medical marijuana might be all I need. Its benefits for stress relief have been well-documented. No. I want you to make better choices. Mrs. Frank: What happened to Carrie? Is she okay? Can I see her? Who are you exactly? I'm her employer. Carrie is my nanny. Do you know how to reach her family? No. Uh, I got her through a service. I know she's from Georgia. She's only been here about a month. - You say she fainted? - EMTs brought her in. She's been starving herself lately trying to get stick thin. I'm sure that's probably all it was. I think it's a bit more complicated. I heard a really loud noise like a train was coming right at me, you know? And then my brain just blew apart like a grenade went off inside my head. Sounds incredibly frightening. What makes hallucinations so powerful is that they seem completely real, and this was a very powerful hallucination. The EMTs said that she blacked out, fell, hit her head. She complained of nausea and headache, which would indicate... possible concussion from the fall. - Kate: Does your head still hurt? - Not as much as you might think, - since it freaking blew up. - Cool. I could feel it happen, but I could see it happen, too, like I was outside myself watching a movie. And there was blood all around and bits of my brain splattered everywhere. Differential? Some kind of drug reaction... Hallucinogen like pcp or mushrooms. Have you taken any drugs recently, Carrie... - Prescription or... - No, no, no. I would never, not even aspirin. Her tox was clean. Any other possible causes of hallucinations, Ali? Let's see. Uh, it depends on whether they're auditory or visual, - recurrent or is... - Great stalling. - Leo. - Schizophrenia, delirium, any retinal pathology, migraine, seizures, neurodegenerative disease, peduncular hallucinosis are all possible. And the obvious... Exploding head syndrome. - Good one. - It's real. Look it up. Leo puts on a good show because he has hyper-memory, which means he can remember everything that ever happened to him. And I'm willing to bet you that he can tell us the color of the shirt he wore on his first day of kindergarten. Blue with a graphic of papa smurf and a ketchup stain right, uh... Don't care. But knowing a lot of facts does not mean that you can put them together. Why does exploding head syndrome not work here, Ali? It happens when you sleep. The explosion wakes the patient up. And you were wide awake, so now we know what it isn't. Let's find out what this is, okay? ♪ take a look at my pretty girl ♪ - [camera shutter clicking] - * through these lovers' eyes * ♪ oh, yeah, you smash my world ♪ ♪ a pain I won't disguise ♪ - [knock on door] - * oh, broken broken, oh, my soul * - Dr. Black sent us. - * you crucify my heart * she has a fascinoma for you... 21-year-old female who thinks her head exploded.

Kate: Hey. Esme texted me. She wants to talk. She shouldn't have done that. Is something wrong? Nothing's wrong. It's just the opposite. Esme probably wanted to be the one to tell you this, but... She won an audition to the high-school program at the avalon academy of performing arts. Oh, my God, Joshua, that's fantastic! I know. It's huge. And it comes with a scholarship, so if she gets it, you don't have to pay anymore for her fancy private school. And there's some kind of audition? And you're going, and Reagan, too? Yes. But I can't come. I'm sorry, Kate. What do you want me to do? I-I'll do whatever you say. Oh, nothing. I mean, I don't want to... I don't want to come in between you and Reagan. I know this sucks. I mean, you gave her her first piano. Given what happened last week... that freaked Reagan out. Look, Reagan just isn't ready to lift the ban on you and Esme seeing each other. No, I, uh... I totally understand. I do. So, just give Esme a hug for me, will you? And tell her, um... [Clicks tongue] Well, you know what to say. I do. And I'm sorry. I love you. [Door closes] Dr. Bickman. Can I help you? [Gasps] You know, I can't stop thinking about last time. [Sighs] Well, it was a mistake. It will never happen again. - It just did. - No. No! It did not. You just assaulted me. Delicious, wasn't it? Almost as fun as when you assaulted me? You know, I'd swear that you were high that time... High as a kite. Excuse me? I was not high, okay? I do not do drugs. I do not ever do drugs. Is that what I think it is? It's none of your business. [Gasps] Dr. Black, you are a very bad girl. I hope you'd never consider smoking this at work. [Door opens] Oh, good. I've got both of you. Come with me. I need you in a staff meeting about physician misconduct. These images were taken last month. As you can see, this is our former colleague, chief of neurosurgery Dr. Reynaud. Now, Dr. Reynaud is preparing to use LITT, or laser interstitial thermal therapy, to remove a thalamic tumor. Now, just as he turns the laser on, at the most crucial moment, Dr. Reynaud suffers a grand mal seizure. The laser, unmanned, injures the brain stem of the patient, who died as a result of this preventable error. Okay, this is horrific. It is. But I have known Reynaud since I interned under him. He had an undiagnosed brain tumor. It caused the seizure. If he'd have known, he would not have been operating. He did know. The patient's family hired investigators, who discovered that Dr. Reynaud went out of state on his vacation three months earlier and was biopsied and diagnosed. Should have stopped practicing immediately. The lesson from this disaster is simple... If anyone has a medical condition that can harm patients, they must come forward. And if anyone knows of a doctor hiding such a condition and does not bring it to my attention, they, too, will be held accountable. This is a firing offense. Am I clear? [Beep] This will take 15 to 20 minutes unless you move. Then we have to start over, so please don't move, Carrie, okay? Just try to relax. Okay, baby docs. Give me some cool differentials. - What's Carrie got? - [Beep] Glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, oligodendroglioma. A brain tumor would explain all her symptoms. Vasculitis is certainly in the mix, or maybe meningitis. Ooh. Last guy we had in the cube with that, he was 33... Dead in week. Stop! Stop! I want to get out of here! I want to see Dr. Black! You twerp! That's the Mike switch! She heard every word. - [Beep] - Okay, Carrie, you're all right. No, I'm not all right! I'm dying! No. No! [Body thuds] Carrie? Can you hear me? She can't move. What's happening? I don't know, but she's paralyzed. What's going on? So, Carrie freaked and crawled out of the MRI, and then she collapsed. She is hemodynamically stable... Normal B.P., normal pulse... but she's completely unresponsive. What the hell are you doing? I'm not gonna post it on Reddit or anything. All right, put it away before I jam it down your throat. Got it. All right, she's slipped into a metabolic coma. We're gonna need a cbc, serum electrolytes, LTFs, creatinine, lactate, ABG, P.T., and a PTT. Did you find anything? The MRI was motion-degraded, but I did see micro-cortical ischemia in the occipital and temporal regions. All right. Get Bickman in here for a consult while I check the films. Woman over P.A.: P.A. Clark, transfer to line 6. P.A. Clark... Well, she's awake and alert. She seems fine. Fine? She was paralyzed. She came around on the way to the icu. - I sent her back to her room. - What? She remembers everything that happened to her when she was paralyzed. She told me one of your short coats tried to take her picture and you threatened to jam his cell down his throat. She remembered that? Yeah, so, it couldn't have been a metabolic coma. - No, the blood work... - It came back normal. Have you seen the MRI? She's had numerous tiny strokes. In the occipital and temporal regions, which could be causing the hallucinations in combination with the side effects of drug withdrawal... Probably from a stimulant like cocaine. I'm sorry. Come again? The cocaine caused the ministrokes. The tox was clean. The hallucinations come from drug withdrawal. If she's trying to kick coke, you wouldn't see it on the tox. It clears the system in 48 hours. And you just pulled the idea that she's an addict from thin air? No, from patient history. Her employer said she's been trying to lose weight. - I'm thinking she's doing it the old-fashioned way. - No, you're wrong. She told me. She promised. In fact, she swore. She doesn't do drugs. - And it never crossed your mind she could be lying? - No. I mean, people have been known to lie about their drug use from time to time. [Yawns] How are you? How am I doing? I'm terrified, and my head just blew apart again. Boom! And there was blood everywhere, and my brain... little bits everywhere. - You seem tired. - I am tired. I-I'm tired all the time. I can't stay awake. Okay. Carrie, I don't care if you lie to anyone else, about you have to tell me the truth. If you lie to a doctor, you do not get the right diagnosis. Without the right diagnosis, whatever's going on here is gonna get a lot worse. I always tell you the truth. The imaging shows you had a lot of strokes. This is highly unusual in someone your age unless there's a history of drug abuse. Now... have you been using cocaine? Good lord, no. Dr. Black, I'm a church girl. I would never use drugs. What about A.D.D. medication... dextroamphetamine? No. No way. [Yawns] Get some rest, Carrie. I'm gonna be back later. Bickman's right? I hate to say it, but yeah. The yawning, the tiredness... All symptoms of cocaine withdrawal. She was so adamant, so convincing. All addicts lie. They get to be very good at it. What's this? A patient of Bickman's wants a consult. It's our former neurosurgeon, Dr. Reynaud. I think you'll want to take this one. [Door opens] Hello, old friend. Hello, Catherine. [Sighs] I'm so sorry. Well, thank you for seeing me. Most of the other doctors aren't talking to me. Well, that's inexcusable. You're not to blame for what happened. The tumor impaired your judgment. I never should have been operating. When I was 10 years old, my father told me, "you have a surgeon's hands." - He was a doctor? - Oh, yeah. I hoped my son would be one, too. But Peter teaches third grade in Harlem. He never wanted anything to do with this. And you've spoken to him about your diagnosis? No, no, no. I'll never speak to him again. My only child has not taken my calls for the last three years. Well, you shouldn't be alone right now. I can call him for you. It's... It won't work. Oh, I hurt him. I was never there for him growing up. I gave up everything for medicine... My marriage, my family. I missed Peter's wedding. A surgeon... that's all I am. And what do you want from me? I want your advice. Well, in terms of treatment, you go for the chemo and you go for the radiation. And, yes, you have the surgery. You remove as much of the tumor as possible, and with luck... What if I don't want to live? Catherine, I killed a patient. What if what I want is for Bickman to make one small slip of the knife? - No. - That's why I asked you here. Could you talk to him for me? You're not serious. My prognosis is bleak. The treatment is a nightmare. It's a slow descent into hell. I'll lose control over my body, my mind. You could live for another year. I don't want another year. I don't... I don't want another day. I want to die. No. You have to fight this thing with all you've got, okay? You have to buy as much time as you can, and then you spend it with your son. You repair what is broken between you, and then you make something good come from this. Okay? That is my advice to you... fight. Fight. [Sighs] [Ringing] Hey, you've reached Esme. Leave me a message and I will call you back. [Sighs] It's beautiful. Is this for tomorrow? - Yeah. - I... I love that color on you. It's perfect. I can't decide if I want my hair up or down. I... let me see it down. [Sighs] I love it both ways. But do you think if you put it up maybe it won't get in your face when you play? - Yeah. - You're right, mom. Thanks. [Cellphone rings] I don't believe this. You're calling her cellphone? This is exactly the kind of thing you promised not to do. It hasn't even been a week. Hello, Reagan. - We had an agreement... no contact. - I know. So, your word means absolutely nothing? Please, listen. Something happened, okay? Something bad. I wanted to hear Esme's voice. I just saw a doctor I've known a long time, a colleague, a friend, and he's dying, and his son won't talk to him, - and I just... - I don't want to hear it. You can't call Esme when you're upset. You can't call her when you're manic or depressed. You can't call her for comfort. You're supposed to be the grown-up. You're right. Absolutely right. Just forget this ever happened, okay? I can't. Helen: Tell me how you're feeling. I'm angry... At myself mostly, but also at her. She's right, which is super-annoying. Why did you call her? Because I don't want to end up like Reynaud. If anyone at the cube finds out about your diagnosis, you could lose your job. Yes, I worry about that, but that's not why I called Esme. I called her because I don't want to end up alone. She's my girl. She's my daughter. You gave her up long ago. Why did you do that? You know all this. - Will you tell me again? - [Sighing] Oh, my God. Because I did not want her to have the kind of childhood Joshua and I had, okay? Because I was afraid I would be a mother like my mother. Let's talk about what kind of mother she was. When she was well, she was dazzling... Warm and loving and compassionate. - No, that's not right. - And then, inevitably, she would ramp up. [Muttering] [Objects clatter] - Stupid. - Joshua! Energy became mania. Mania became fury. You did not know that. You did not know that. And then the monster would appear. Aah! Clean it up! [Door slams] Helen: When Esme was born during your first manic break when you were 16, you gave her to Joshua and Reagan to raise up as their own child. Yes. You wanted her to have what you never had... A happy childhood. There's no greater gift. Do you want to take it back? You have somewhere else to turn for love and support. Could you give will the one thing you can't give to your daughter? Love?

What did he say? He told me to marry you. Well, you tried. And I will try again. If I stay on the meds. I know. And I promise I will. What happened last time, it won't ever happen again. I'm not an idiot, Kate. I've done the research. The meds don't work all the time. You can't control this. Absolutely right, but I'm a doctor. - If they start not to work, I can fix it. - How? I get out the prescription pad and self-medicate. - That's illegal. - Technically, but it's done all the time. - Wow. - Hey, stop. What do you want me to say? Not whatever you think I need to hear. I want the truth. You know why honesty is so important to me. - Your father. - Yes. A lifelong drunk who died in a car accident, blood-alcohol level through the roof. And when I heard he was dead, I didn't even cry. I was relieved because I had grown to hate him. I couldn't believe a word he said. How many times did he promise he'd be there for me at a ball game, a science fair, my birthday? He was never there. He never stopped drinking, and he lied and lied and lied. I'm not your father. I can handle anything... anything but lies. You have to tell me. Is there anything else I should know? Anything you're hiding from me? I slept with someone in San Francisco... A total stranger. I didn't even know his name. Will. ♪ [beeps] [Beeps] [Beeps] Hey. Carrie? Carrie. Mm. Let's get you back to bed. Mm. [Dialing] [Ringing] Peter: Hello? Pete. It's your father. [Click] Kate: She warned us that she didn't want to live anymore, but she said that 1,000 times. Karina: [Crying] Listen to me. I'm your mother, and I want to die. Reynaud: I don't want another year. I don't want another day. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. [Flatline] Reynaud! [Panting] [Alarm blaring] Code blue! Code blue!

Charge to 160j biphasic. Clear the table. Clear! - [Flatline continues] - Okay, it's recharging. Shock again. Clear! All right, give me one milligram of epi. Check the rhythm. [Heart monitor beeping] We have a pulse. [Sighs] [Exhales deeply] If you'd come one minute later, he wouldn't have made it. Good work. It's not what you think. It's not mine. It's a friend's. Carrie, I asked you not to lie to me. Stop lying before it's too late. You know cocaine caused strokes in your brain? I'm not addicted. I can stop any time. I haven't used in days. This stuff could kill you. I take it to stay awake. I was tired before. I was tired all the time, and I couldn't do my job, and Mrs. Frank has me working such long hours, and I go to night school to get a better job, and I can't do it all without a little bump every now and again. If you keep it up, the hallucinations will be the least of your worries. Okay. I get it. But pl... please don't tell Mrs. Frank. I have no place to go without my job. [Voice breaking] I can't go back to Georgia. There is nothing for me there now that my mom's gone. [Sobs] We can help you beat this. Let me take care of you. I swear I'll stay clean from now on... But on my own. I can't do a program. I have to go back to work, and you cannot tell Mrs. Frank. Please promise me. Please. All right, it's late. You need to get some rest, okay? We're gonna talk about this more in the morning, okay? [Sighs] ♪ How's it going with singles in the sciences? A lot of lonely nerds out there, and apparently I'm a geek magnet. I have my first date tonight. - Oh. - He's a gerontologist. They're all looney-tunes, which I like. Hey, weren't you on the floor all night? - Why are you still here? - Uh, I saw something weird happen with Carrie. I'm waiting for Dr. Black to come in so I can tell her before I leave. As if there's anything you could tell Dr. Black. [Scoffs] Hello, Peter. This is Dr. Black at the cube. - I'm an old friend of your father's. - Peter: Hi. - He's in the hospital. - Oh. I'm afraid he tried to kill himself last night. He has a brain tumor. He's terminal. But he could live for a year or more if he has the treatment. - Okay. - I'm hoping that he'll go through with the surgery that's scheduled for today, but... he may not... Because he says he wants to die. Look, Dr. Black... I was thinking that maybe if you came to see him, it would make him feel more hopeful and... I'm sorry. I'm out of town for a conference. Okay. I see. I understand. - Okay. - Goodbye, doctor. - Thank you. - Bye. Yeah? Dr. Black? Um... I can see that you're busy, but I think this may be important. Something happened with Carrie last night. I know. Bickman was right. It's cocaine. She was lying all along. No, it's something else. Carlotta said that Carrie was up and down a lot last night like she couldn't sleep, but when I checked her, she was asleep in a chair. I couldn't wake her up. - Go on. - It was like she passed out. I was going to call for help, but then she opened her eyes like nothing happened, and I got her back to bed. Where is she? She left sometime in the middle of the night. - Easter 2009. - Sunday, April 12th. What day of the week did Bill Buckner drop the ball in the world series? It was game six. 1986. October 25th... a Saturday. And he didn't drop the ball. It went through his legs. We got to get Carrie back. Can you find a number for her? Leo, what happened to Carrie before she hallucinated again? Did she close her eyes? Come on. Think carefully. Use your hyper-memory. No, I'm not all right! I'm dying! Yes. She closed her eyes. Nice work, Ali. What's going on? Carrie has narcolepsy and exploding head syndrome. Impossible. E.H.S. only happens when you're asleep. Right, but narcolepsy makes you fall asleep anywhere in an instant, even on your feet. Once asleep, she had the hallucination of her head exploding. - The small strokes? - Incidental. The cocaine was a clue, but she took the coke to stay awake. - She got hooked. - And the paralysis? - Cataplexy. - [Scoffs] Side effect of narcolepsy. In a cataplectic state, the patient is awake yet paralyzed. - Nice catch. - Thank you. Okay, we got to find her. This thing could be dangerous. I have her cell number and her employer's house number. Great. Try her cell first. So, iron man is red, right? Yeah. Ba-da. [Yawns] M-Mrs. Frank, this is the hospital calling. We're trying to find Carrie. It's an emergency. - [Cellphone ringing] - Oh, okay. I just need to rest for a little bit, okay? [Ice-cream truck music plays] - Ice cream! Ice cream! I want ice cream! - No, no, no. - No, no, no, no. No ice cream. - Please, please? [Ringing continues] [Tires screech] Oliver! Aah! Oliver, stop! [Horn honks] [Heart monitor beeping] A sleep study will give us final confirmation. Narcolepsy doesn't show up on any other tests. That's why nothing we did before helped us with the diagnosis. - The treatment is modafinil. - Yes. It's great stuff. Fighter pilots use it. Yeah, they're not the only ones. Carrie. You okay? I'm so sorry, Dr. Black from now on, things are gonna be different. I know they will. [Knock on door] Yeah? - I knocked. Polite? - Very good. Don't push it. I came to apologize for my crap consult. No worries, Ian, your theory made perfect sense. You want to watch Reynaud's op? I promised I'd see him before he goes under. Did you reach his son? Yeah. There's a lot of anger there. It's very sad. - Is he coming? - You know, I don't know. He didn't say he would. Do you want children? - You know, it's none of your business. - I don't. When they're little, they're needy little brats. They yell and barf and poop their pants. Then they grow up and hate you for not being a good enough parent. Where's the upside in that? Somehow, I don't think you'd make the best father. And I don't see you as the mother type. You're probably right about that. So, I don't suppose you want to grab a drink later. You're incorrigible. It's one of my best qualities. I never give up. Hey. - How are you doing? - Okay. I should be angry with you... But I'm not. Today, I saw... a beautiful sunrise. I'm so glad. [Chuckles] Peter? [Voice breaking] You look... You look wonderful. You look like hell. Mm. [Indistinct conversation] [Laughter] Forget about everything but the music. Hey, the outcome doesn't matter. Just lose yourself in the moment. Whatever happens, we're so proud. [Chuckles] We love you. Man: Next audition, on piano, playing number one... Okay. All right. Esme Black. [Applause] [Sighs] [Slow-tempo music plays] [Laughs] Ian: Turned out, it wasn't really his brain. [Laughs] [Cellphone ringing] [Slow-tempo music plays] [Up-tempo jazz music plays] [Slow-tempo music plays]
