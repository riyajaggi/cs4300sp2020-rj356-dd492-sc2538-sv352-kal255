 Previously on "Black Box"... I'd like to propose a-a toast to the brilliant woman who I'm now going to be spending the rest of my life with. What happened between us... It was meaningless sex. Why do you want me to touch you again? - I don't. - You do. Know that new hostess at the restaurant... Delilah? I slept with her. If you could get away with it, you'd do it again in a heartbeat. Got a date.

 - Great. - Okay, girl. Pucker up, diva. - Holding the smile. - Here we go. Perfect. - Genius. Magnificent, Frankie. - Yeah. - Nobody uses color like Frankie. - Come on. Nope, not the lips. Not the lips. Great. Now I want to see that wave movement backwards again, all right? I want to see this beautiful makeup. Turn to me again. Stay facing forward, but look at me, okay? Thank you. Great, looking great. Now hold that. - Now just wave to me. - All right. Each one to their own direction. Okay. How about let's get together? Stay to the camera. Perfect. - Hands at your side, everyone. - My leg is numb. Oh. Someone partied too hard last night. Perfect. Let's try to get a crazy angle. How about that? Frankie! - Frankie? - Frankie! Synced by emmasan www.Addic7ed.Com Johnson with another beautiful three-pointer! Whoo! Get in there, Johnson! Mom, I think I just spotted dad way up in the 300s. I don't know why he didn't ask me. I could have gotten him seats on the floor. Okay, everybody listen up. I made a binder so you guys can be organized about this. You have a lot of decisions to make. All right. Budget, decor, photography. - Wow. - Josh and I got married at city hall. So I never got to do this. I hope you don't mind. Are you kidding? It's fantastic. In fact, I had an idea about the venue. You know the Galapagos Art Space in Dumbo? No, that's way too big. We're gonna need room to dance. Please tell me you're gonna have one of those goofy, prefab dance numbers. Oh, come on. You know we are! Pow, pow! Come on! - Come on. - Right? Whoa! Oh. Nice. Hey, h-have you thought about what kind of ceremony you want? Yeah, simple. Right, babe? I mean, on my side, I'm thinking just my mom and stepdad. Catherine's meeting them Friday night. They're having us over to dinner. Well, that's exciting. Yeah. It's exciting... and nerve-racking. They're gonna love you. W-what about you, Catherine? I know Esme's your maid of honor. I'm not asking Hunter, if that's what you're getting at. - I really wasn't. - He's not invited. It's fine. It's your choice. Do you want to talk about photography or... or wedding colors? You want to choose your colors? Wedding colors? Is that really a thing? - How about we talk about the food? - U.N. human rights workers - have been kidnapped in Aleppo... - Now, Carlos, my sous-chef... He was saying that we should do a communal table... Where the opposition to the regime of Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad had been battling a deadly air offensive. There are three Americans in the party, including pulitzer prize-winning journalist Miranda Archer. - Archer is a veteran war correspondent... - Oh, my God. Who's Miranda Archer? She's this amazing photographer. She... she had an exhibition at the Whitney last year. She photographed all these underage girls in Yemen who were forced into marriage. Hmm. Great photographer. Don't think she'll be doing your wedding. Rebels fought back to defend the camp but not before the U.N. Workers were taken. Earlier this week, a dozen U.N. Workers arrived in Aleppo to provide aid - to refugees at a rebel camp. - Well... This administration does not need another Benghazi. The administration's probably in on it, you know... Just like they were those chemical-weapons attacks. Here we go. Bring on another conspiracy theorist. Manuel is a proud member of the lunatic fringe. He also believes that the tooth fairy is a big... Expecting company? Hey. Sit down, nurse. Hi. Hi. I'm looking for Dr. Black. My friend Frankie has an appointment. Well, I would be more than happy to help. - What was your name? - Cara. Cara... What a beautiful name. I'm Dr. Ian Bickman, chief of neurosurgery. And, uh... I'm Dr. Morely. I'm chief of staff. And a neurologist, like Dr. Black. So, you must be Frankie. - You hear that. - Mm-hmm. Mr. Fordham suffered a bilateral PCA stroke five weeks ago. He was immediately rushed to city presbyterian... and admitted to the stroke unit. - You're lucky. - How's that? Well, strokes are treatable, but every minute counts. And the reason why you're recovering so well is because they got you to the hospital so fast. I see that you've been to the doctor a few times recently. Now you're here. Why? None of them could figure out why I'm not okay. Nothing is right, you know? Tell me more. I was a joyful person. I loved my life. I loved my work. I loved going up on the roof and watching the sunsets. I mean, spring was my favorite time of the year because all of the new blossoms were coming out. When I saw the piet oudolf gardens for the first time on the high line, I wept for joy. And since your stroke, you no longer feel this way? The color has gone out of my life. Good morning, Delilah. Good morning. Carlos, que pasa? That needs a splash more muscadet. You can tell just by sniffing? Yep. Toss these. The oil's evaporated. Use the Panamanian beans. Where did you learn to do that? I've always been able to do it, but now I know what it is. I have a condition called hyperosmia... Increased olfactory acuity. Excuse me. Is it contagious? This is what happens when you're engaged to a neurologist. The way your brain is wired becomes the explanation for every ability you have. Sounds dull and analytical to me. I assure you, life with Catherine... is anything but dull. Hey. Can you back off, please? Excuse me. Perfume's getting all up in my olfactory bulb. Whatever that means. The imaging is consistent with two strokes, one on each side of the head, which shows us... Oh, hey. Are those the imaging results for that Frankie fellow? Just curious. You're just curious? Really? What's surprising about that? Oh, uh... I'm glad you're all here. I was wondering if there was any information that I could convey to Mr. Fordham's lady friends, who are very eager for information. Is Frankie Fordham some kind of dignitary or something? Ali, why don't you explain to Lina why Dr. Bickman and Dr. Morely are so interested in Frankie's brain scans. Well, I believe it's because Mr. Fordham's lady friends are very... tall. Okay. Well, I was about to say that the MRA shows a bilateral occlusion in the PCA, and then the MRI shows restricted diffusion at the site of both lesions. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, well, if you... wanted to tell them, that's fine with me. Oh, no, I mean, if you're... If you're interested, I... Well, I was going that way, but... but, you know, I mean, if you wanted to tell them... I don't... You b-be my guest. - No. I... no, you go ahead. - No, no, please. Boys, you don't need to fight. Bickman, why don't you tell the ladies that strokes can cause sensory damage? And, Owen, you can tell them that I'm gonna perform some tests on Frankie. Well, I'm... I'm happy with that. I'm happy with that. Tell me what you see. A bunch of dots. Okay. Do you see anything within the dots? A picture? Letter? Number? Nothing. Okay. All right. I think I've figured out what's going on here, Frankie. Shall we go see your friends? The stroke you had damaged the cerebral cortex in your brain. Now, this caused a condition called cerebral achromatopsia, which... is a type of color blindness. Now, most people think that you see through your eye, through your retina, but the retina basically sends pictures to the brain, and the brain processes them. But because of the stroke, your brain is unable to interpret color now. But if Frankie was color blind, why wouldn't he just say so? Most people with this kind of sensory damage after a stroke, they're very confused and not understand what's going on. They will often say things like, "the world is... is dull," or, "it's gray." In fact, that's exactly the words you used, right, Frankie? You said "colorless." Look, don't worry, Frankie. You realize that he works with color? - I do. - And his career depends on it. This condition can be transient. But as of now, there are no known treatments. There are great rehab facilities that will help you deal with the loss of color vision, Frankie. This hospital, in fact, has one of the finest in the country, - and I give you... - Are you saying I'll never get better? Well, if he's depressed, he should see Dr. Mahmoud. I want to try to help him first. It's just color blindness, nothing else? No, it's not just color blindness. Morely. Color is vitally important to this man. But it's not life-threatening, and there's no cure, so he's just gonna have to learn to live with it. Put him through. Exactly, that's where we have to help him... Learn to live with it. Yes. Uh... oh. That's terrible. That's terrible news. Uh, I'll... I'll tell Dr. Bickman. Our entire facility will be at the ready. Okay, this hasn't hit the news, and it's not for public knowledge, but Navy seals attempted a rescue in Damascus. They were ambushed, and one of their party were seriously injured. - Miranda Archer. - Yeah. Piece of shrapnel from an I.E.D. embedded in her skull. They're flying her from Ramstein. She'll be here tomorrow. You are the only neurosurgeon they'll let operate, so get your team prepped. And I will let the chancellor know what's happening. Make sure the D.O.D. Send the C.T. from Ramstein if they did one. - Owen. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. We didn't finish discussing my patient. Catherine, you chose neurology. You should know not all of our patients can be fixed. A world without color. I can't accept that for this patient. I can't accept that there's nothing I can do for him. If I had to fix every patient who came into this room, I'd be a miserable person. This patient, Frankie, grew up with nothing. But he had this gift, you see, and he used that gift to make his world beautiful. Without it, what made him special is gone. I have heard you use those same words about yourself. You mean when I come off a manic episode? Or sometimes when you're about to embark on one. You think I'm gonna come off my meds? Huh? Well, it wouldn't be the first time it happened. Maybe I should. Maybe it's a good idea. Maybe if I came off my medication, my mind would sharpen, and I would come up with some brilliant solution. - Catherine. - No, don't worry. I won't. I am worried. You're under a lot of stress. And on top of that, tomorrow, you're meeting Will's mother and stepfather. I'm looking forward to it. - You're not at all anxious? - As anxious as any girl would be meeting her fiancé's parents for the first time, sure. You're not any girl, Catherine. And I think you're anxious. I am. I am anxious. I'm anxious for my patient. There's curing, and there's healing. Maybe it's the time for you to turn your focus to healing Frankie. You sound just like Owen and Bickman. "You can't do anything, so move on. Next. Next patient." I can't do that. I can't let it go. It's not how I'm wired. What about a book? I don't think you should get your future in-laws a book. Why? It's impersonal. And you don't know what interests them. Thank God I have you. Hey. Are you stalking me? Hi. What are you doing here? An afternoon meeting with a colleague? Uh, yeah. Yeah, something like that. Uh, you remember Dr. Bickman. My niece, Esme. Oh, right, yeah. I'm taking her shopping. She's looking for a gift to take her future in-laws. She's meeting them for the first time tomorrow night. Well, congratulations. Thank you. Hey! Hey, what would you take to meet your in-laws, Dr. Bickman? Well, thank God I've never had any. Uh, excuse me. I've got to get back to surgery. Have fun shopping. Oh, I know! What about that special apple tart from that bakery? - The one around the corner? - Yeah. You know, someone brought one as a gift for mom once. S- he totally loved it. That's a good idea. - I got to take this quickly, sweetie. Sorry. - Okay. Hi. I had a thought. I attended a TED talk... mm... a couple of years ago by Daniel Tammet. Do you know who he is? Yeah, of course. He's a mathematical savant. Took part in a bunch of research on memory. Why? Doesn't he also have the condition that causes a person to experience things in more than one sensory pathway simultaneously? Synesthesia? Yeah. In fact, we're about to do some studies on it. Lina's already begun. You mean for Frankie? Well, I just wanted to pass it on. I'm not sure what you do with it. That's your territory, not mine. Uh, Dr. Hartramph... Yes? You couldn't let it go. Hi, Frankie. I'm Dr. Lark. Can you tell us what you've been working on? Okay. So, you know there's this rare neurological condition, synesthesia, where the senses cross? Okay, think of it as hearing color or seeing music. So, I built a synesthesia machine to translate Iron Butterfly's "In-a-gadda-da-vida" into color and shapes. Your friend Dr. Black here came up with the idea of reverse-engineering it to transpose color back into sound. Cool, huh? Okay, load up the images. Do you recognize these? I'm sorry. I know this must be upsetting seeing your work right now. But I needed you to see images that you were familiar with so you could recognize the colors. Will you put this headset on? Okay, and we are streaming. Now, do you remember what color you painted Cara's lips? Red. Good. Focus on it. That is the sound of red. Red is at the bottom of the visual spectrum, so it has the lowest frequency. Violet, however, is at the highest. Can we put up... yeah. Now, look at the Violet on her eyes. That's Violet. So, what do you think? It's not the same. No, it's not. You're right. It's very different, but it is a way of seeing color with your ears. I-I've loaded a whole file of images for you. Dr. Bickman, please report to the helipad. Dr. Bickman to the helipad... stat. Will you just experiment with this just for a little while? I'll come back and see you. Dr. Bickman, please report to the helipad. - Okay. - Thank you. Dr. Bickman to the helipad... stat. She's landing now. Copy that. We're ambu-bagging through the E.T. Get the vent ready. We'll take her straight through to imaging. Put radiology on call. Page everybody now. Go! No. Got to stay back, though. Clear the O.R. Have all key personnel on deck. I want extra security. Absolutely no press gets through those doors. 37-year-old woman. Shrapnel fragment from an I.E.D. penetrated and lodged in the left head. GCS was 11 at the scene. She was given propofol and roc and intubated... Let's hope Bick can work his magic. Start hypertonic saline and lift the propofol so I can examine her. Alert O.R. she's 10 minutes away from first incision. Got it, doc. Tell radiology I want a C.T. with iodinated contrast. - Radiology, we're 10 minutes out. - She's slipping, Dr. Bickman. Her O2 sat is down. Heart rate is dropping. - All right, catheter. - Catheter. - Okay, scalpel. - Scalpel. All right, check her. Good breath sounds on both sides. Lina, get me that C.T., then get her back to O.R. Yes, doc. All right, let's move. Here we go. Frankie. Are you leaving? - Yeah. - All right. How many colors were you able to distinguish? None. It's not color. It's sound. Dr. Black, please report to radiology stat. Okay, I know what it feels like. Dr. Black to radiology stat. I know what it feels like to be told that you might not experience the one thing that gives you a thrill, that gives you pleasure and joy. I know that. You might not believe me, but it's true. Dr. Black, they need you downstairs in radiology stat. Okay, I'll be there in one second. Just do me a favor, will you? Just take these home, practice a couple hours. If it doesn't work, throw them in a garbage. We'll find something else. Dr. Black. - Take her to the prep room. - Yes, doctor. - Catherine, - Yeah. I need you to look at Miranda Archer's scan. Look. There's something unusual. But the metal artifact's making it hard to decipher. I don't want to miss anything. Well, that's shrapnel, isn't it? Yeah, it's lodged close to the right frontoparietal cranial suture. The good news is that it doesn't seem to be impinging - any vessels or cranial nerves. - Show me the scalp. - I don't really know what shrapnel's... - Show me the scalp. - Supposed to look like. - Okay. What is that? I don't know. That... looks like some sort of cartridge, doesn't it? Mm. Is that air at the tip? Are the scans up? They're loading now, Dr. Bickman. Everybody, back away from her! She has a live round of ammunition in her head! It's unexploded! Don't touch her. Don't touch her! It could detonate anytime! All personnel must vacate the hospital immediately. This is not a drill. Hey. Can you... All patients for transfer, please exit. Code black. Code black. Code black. - Isaiah. - Yes, sir. Everybody in the vicinity, please. I need these corridors cleared. U.H. Is setting up a temporary ward. Power everything down, Dr. Morely? - Everything. - Even mobile devices? Especially mobile devices. Yes. Electricity can trigger the explosive, so everything. Everything. Yeah, shut it all down, man. - All zones, yeah. - Bring it forward. - Are you captain Duffy? - Captain Duffy. We've cut power to the O.R., but the radiology suite is just below that. So I need your permission to print out a C.T. scan of the patient. Afraid not. It's not gonna happen. Are you telling me my chief neurosurgeon is going to be removing a live explosive from the patient's head without a C.T. scan, without instruments, and without a monitor? That's right. Bick. Are you sure you can do this? Pitch-black, no monitor, no scans? There's no other option. Let me assist you. What? No. - I saw the scan. - No, no, no, no. - I saw the C.T. - Absolutely not. I know where, I know how the fragment is lodged. No. Bick, I have knowledge of the scan. I know the anatomy inside out. - He cannot operate on someone... - It's crazy. No. With a penetrating brain injury without any scan... - Look, I am not going to lose... - ...without any knowledge in the darkness! My two most gifted doctors to one stupid maneuver. No. Absolutely not. You got another flack jacket? I have one more suit, but it's not made for females. - Fine. - What are you doing? If you let me assist, you stand a better chance of not losing any doctors or any patients. Okay, good. What's that for? The inhalational anesthetic. If it's gas, it's too volatile. It would make an explosion worse. All right, we'll take her off the sevo, put her on propofol. You use the pump for propofol, and... we've turned the pump off. All right, 50cc over 30 minutes is how many drips per minute? - 10 drips per minute. - Right. Count the drips. The fragment is lodged close to the frontoparietal suture. There's no visible damage to the brain tissue or hemorrhaging. Scalpel. All right, clamp. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Hold on. Hold on. You can't use metal instruments in the live ordnance. Well, how do you suggest I get it out? With your fingers... Very carefully. The round is impact-detonated. The slightest excess manual pressure could set it off. The tip of the cartridge is close to a feeder off the A.C.A. Okay? If you advance a millimeter more... It could rupture. Back off a second. Go to the lateral side. Easy. That's it. Angle it away from the midline. Good. You've got it. Easy. Who needs imaging? Oh, Ian. You mind sending... A few of those lesser mortals in? I'm not used to picking up my own drill. Whoo! Oh, my son is the best. He knows I have been looking all over for a dollywood snow globe. Oh, look at me. I am so excited. You probably think I'm cuckoo. No, Will told me all about your collection. - Mm-hmm. - Well, it must seem trivial. Tell us about your work. You're so young to be a neuroscientist. Neurologist, mom. No, neuroscientist is fine. I'm... actually, I'm both. But I got you something little. Can you believe it, Charlie? You must have had to go to school a long time. Ooh, look at this. Apple pie. This is my favorite. Ruby doesn't eat sweets 'cause she's diabetic, but I'm certainly gonna enjoy this. Where's pops? I want Catherine to meet him. Uh, he's, uh, watching TV. Pops! Pops, come on, man! - You didn't tell me she's diabetic. - I did. Don't worry about it. It's the thought that counts. - Come on. - He's down 20.5 inches - in just three months. - Dad. Dad, Will's here. And he brought someone special with him. Hey, pops. - This is Catherine. - The woman who's planning to spend the rest of her life with our boy. You know, she looks pretty good, but he ain't gonna be able to get rid of that gut. We're having company, dad. Sorry, that's... that's my pops. I've just got to call... Check on a patient before dinner, okay? - Yeah, no problem. - Dad. Come on, dad. - We told you this morning. - Don't you bother me when I'm watching TV. Come on, now. I told you before. Owen, what's going on with Archer? Bick felt the best way to reduce risk to her brain was to perform a decompressive craniectomy. What? That's too risky. He must be exhausted. Well, you know Bick. He's invigorated. - Should I come back? - No, no. You just, uh, enjoy your evening. Make nice with the new in-laws. See you tomorrow. Green stuff doesn't belong in meat loaf. Wouldn't let my woman try to sneak it in there. That's why you don't have a woman. Delicious, Mrs. Gibson. Thank you. Please call me Ruby. Or, if you want to, you can call me mom. It's my special recipe. I have a whole binder full of recipes. Of course, Will has no use for them. But now I'll have a daughter-in-law I can finally share them with. I went to Kinko's and made up a binder for you. My gosh. That's so kind of you. - Thank you. - Matching. I'm a little intimidated. I-I'm not much of a cook, I'm afraid. Well, maybe you'll start cooking more once you get married. Will needs someone to cook for him. He works so hard cooking in that restaurant. He shouldn't have to cook when he comes home. - Right. - Uh, Catherine works hard, too, mom. Maybe she'll start to work part-time. Especially after you have kids. Excuse me. Um, I have to take this. I'm sorry. You know, we're still kind of working out, you know, planning the wedding and whatnot. - Hey. - Getting ready to open the dura. I just wanted your opinion about where to store the skull segment I removed. Would it be possible to send me a picture? Sure. Here. Take a picture. Trying to get her to go to Bermuda. Yeah, well, he did that with his first wife. I'm not gonna do the same thing you did with your first wife. I'm not doing that. Gabby Giffords' bone was stored in a freezer, but, uh... I think I like the belly for this. Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking. We store it in her belly for six to eight weeks and keep it sterile and nourished. - Good. - Thanks. Okay, bye. Okay. Oh, baby. I'm sorry about that. - Everything okay? - Yeah, everything's fine. You're a busy lady. It's okay. Don't apologize. I was just telling mom that we haven't exactly decided what kind of wedding we're having yet. But no matter what, she and Charlie will be part of the ceremony. Of course. If I may take a liberty, dear, I want to give you some motherly advice. Now, today, you might think you want a... A small, modest affair. But someday, when you bust out the albums - to show your grandkids... - Mm-hmm. You're gonna be happy you went all-out. Just go for it, honey! It's mine. Now... Now I know why my son is so taken with you. He told me you were smart and pretty, but, oh, my heavens. Oh, stop. You're... you're too kind. I'm the lucky one. He's a... He's a catch. - Yes. He is. - Yeah. So, I do hope you are as crazy about him as he is about you. My son deserves a wife who thinks he is the sun, the moon, and the stars. Yes, he does. I got a powerful suggestion for you. Oh, take it easy, little fella. I can't understand about the pancakes. I made them according to the directions on the box. Do you mind if I join you? Well, it says here, they should be "feather-light, golden cakes that melt in your mouth." Well, naturally, they have to say something like that to sell the stuff, Harriet. What's the verdict from dear, old dad? Well, evidently, you haven't been counting, or you'd know that dear, old dad took on about five pounds of pancakes this morning. 2 cups of flour. 1 cup of sugar. Now I add the pineapple juice. Count the drips. 50cc over 30 minutes is 10 drips per minute. I'm off to work, sweetie. - I might be a little late tonight. - Okay. Honey, will you pass me the scalpel, please? I need to cut up the pineapple. Thank you. Stop that. My husband is quite a catch. He is the sun and the moon and the stars. My husband is quite a catch. He is the sun and the moon and the stars. My husband is quite a catch. He is the sun... and the moon... and the stars! Don't forget you're, uh, dropping me off at the Cube. Yep. Carlos and I are leaving for the farm at the crack of dawn to pick our vegetables for the weekend, so maybe we should just stay at our own places tonight. Okay, sure. Are we gonna talk about this? About what? About the fact that you had a horrible time tonight? I didn't. You were distracted and disinterested. You must have walked off five times - to take phone calls, text messages. - I'm sorry. I have a patient in crisis, okay? Anyway, I'm not the only one who took texts during dinner. Mine wasn't a work text. It was from Delilah. Okay. She sent me a picture. What now? Oh, great. A perfect end to the perfect evening. What is it? Carlos says there was some kind of fight or something outside the restaurant. They broke a window. I have to get over there. I was just checking in on her before I head home for the night. Yeah, me, too. Everything went really well. Yeah. We lifted her sedation briefly, and she moved her limbs voluntarily and localized to pain. Bick did it again, huh? Well... he couldn't have done this one without you. What you did today, that was extraordinary. It's nothing compared to what Miranda does. Good night. Owen. Bick went home, right? Well, uh, I'm not certain, but I think he might be up on the roof. Oh. Hi, there. I was just about to text you again. You stole Carlos' phone? Stole? That's a little dramatic. I borrowed it. Get out. Come on. Get... out. Fine. I don't know why you're smiling. This is just sad. Aren't you even gonna offer me your coat? Thank you. Good night. __ How was dinner? You were extraordinary today. Yeah, the surgery went perfectly. It was a pretty basic procedure. Took a little longer than I anticipated, but we'll know more in the coming days. So... How was dinner with the in-laws? It was lovely. Fine people? They were, in fact... The most kind, lovely, adorable, close-knit family that I never had. - You were bored to tears. - It's not boring. It was... it's just more complicated than that. Yeah, well, it would have been for me. Every dinner party I've ever been to, no matter what the occasion, I'm bored out of my mind. Bored by the normal, bored by the happy, the unhappy couples, and bored out of my mind by families, good, bad, or indifferent. You must have had a family once upon a time. Well, what were they like? Who cares? You don't like to talk about yourself, do you? - No. - Makes you vulnerable. No, I already know all there is to know about me. So why hash over it again? Right. There is only one thing that interests me. Want to take a stab at what that is? And, no, dear. It's not you. It's this. What is there at a dinner party, a gallery opening, a movie, a novel, a Broadway show that could even compare to the case that we had today? Everything else is dull, without color. You know what I do when I'm not here? I mark time... I drink, I screw, and I sleep. You know where I live? No. In the Hotel Mirabella, where I bumped into you and your niece. And when I get bored of that, I'll move to a different hotel. No obligations. No strings. Every morning, I wake up, and the day is there before me... The job, the work. It's incomparable. You know, it's a charming hotel with a quiet bar. Join me for a drink. Synced by emmasan www.Addic7ed.Com
