  My name is liv moore,  and i died, sort of.
  I had a promising career  and a great fiance.
  Then i went to the world's  worst boat party  and got turned into a zombie.
  Now i work at the morgue  for access to brains,
  But brain eating  has side effects.
  I take on the victim's  personality traits
  And have visions which i use  to help solve their murders.
  I work with a detective  who thinks i'm a psychic
  And my boss,  the medical examiner,
  The only person  who knows my secret.
  I'm a crime-fighting zombie.
  Previously on izombie...
  Getting brains on the job.
  I was hoping  you might be so inclined
  As to help a brother out.
  What the hell?
  You need to go.
  -(yells)  -(screams)
  (laughs) you're too easy.
  What a wuss.
  Jackass, that was  quality b-roll.
  Hey, think that'd make  a good shot?
  Picture it, serial killer  sneaks up behind the barrel.
  -(thudding)  -(laughs) nothing but net.
  (sighs)
  (clanks)
  Clank.
  Whatever. Two out of three.
  (grunting from below)
  It's getting late.  Maybe we should...
  Now who's a wuss?
  What are you doing?
  (growling)
  There's a hobo in there, man.
  We can cut him into the movie.
  Or maybe it's a serial killer
  And he can cut us  into stupid virgin stew.
  What if this place  turned him into a mutant,
  And he's got  hermit crab hands?
  Then i'm about to have  three million  instagram followers.
  (growling)
  (theme song playing)
  I'm hungry. Are you hungry?
  Okay, this is interesting.
  I set up a google alert  for the search terms  "seattle, zombie."
  Me, too. No. Uh, i signed up  for z-date.
  Hmm. You joke,  but this could be as close
  As we get  to an early warning system.
  It got a couple of hits.
  Oh, dawn of the dead  is showing at midnight  on friday.
  Uh, undertakers' bar  in capitol hill
  Added the noxious zombie  to the cocktail menu.
  And a teenager posted  a picture on his facebook.
  Claims it's a zombie.
  Is it me?
  Check out the location.
  Abandoned shipyard  on the shore  of lake washington.
  Well, less than a mile  from where you got turned  into a zombie.
  We should at least go  take a look.
  There are already two zombies,  me and blaine.
  Now, there may be a third?
  Two's company,  three's a horde.
  But with great power comes...
  Do not. Seriously.
  Fine! We'll go zombie hunting.
  Solve murders, find zombies.
  Why don't you ever  suggest anything whimsical?
  So how are we doing  with our hit-and-run victim?
  Pretty straightforward.
  Cause of death is probably  the cerebral edema,
  But i need to drain the blood  from the pericardial sac
  To check  for heart lacerations.
  (cell phone chiming  and vibrating)
  (groans)
  (sighs) what's going on?
  You keep getting texts  that disappoint you.
  They're not the texts  that i want.
  I hate to pry...
  Said the man  who keeps asking me
  For my urine samples.  (chuckles)
  It is in search  of a cure, liv.
  Don't cheapen it.
  And you shouldn't feel  compelled to share  your personal...
  I hit on my ex-fiance.
  You have an ex-fiance?
  Yes, who i broke up with  because i'm partially dead.
  I didn't wanna risk  giving him the big "z."
  But then i ate the brain  of seattle's most  sensual painter,
  And i tried to jump  my ex's bones.
  Which is pretty hard  to explain
  When you can't tell him  that you're a zombie.
  For him, i just dumped him  and then hit on him,
  Like the world's  cruelest tease.
  So i texted him an apology  and he hasn't responded.
  -That's awful.  -Yeah.
  You texted your apology.
  It seems to beg for  a face-to-face conversation,  don't you think?
  Uh, i am too hungry right now
  To work out  if you're joking or not.
  Your skull just turned  into a giant animated ham.
  All righty, then.  Let's see. (sighs)
  Marvin webster here,  family man, two kids, suburbs,
  Owner operator  of sea-tac bug whack
  Until someone ran him over  in the whole lotta lotta  car park.
  Should be a pretty safe  brain to eat.
  Said nobody. Ever.
  (whirring)
  Liv: In my old life,  i was a lot of things.
  A doctor, a fiancee,
  A fan of pilates.
  Now, i'm only one thing.
  I'm a stomach,  hunger incarnate.
  When i'm hungry,
  I forget my lunch  used to be a person.
  When the hunger's bad,
  I forget i used to  be one, too.
  That's hot.
  I think i saw that exact pose
  In the centerfold  of zombie playboy.
  Liv: You shouldn't  be here, blaine.
  Why'd you stand me up  last night?
  You were bringing me  some of your bountiful  brain supply, remember?
  I guess you got busy  and forgot.
  You know, since that's  the sort of thing  that slips people's minds.
  Buy milk,  take out the garbage,  feed the starving zombie.
  Who can keep track?
  I didn't know how to reach out  to tell you i wasn't coming.
  Is that your way  of asking for my number?
  Uh...
  I have to get back to work.
  Right. Work, here in  a bottomless buffet of brains
  Ripe for tupperwaring.
  This thing right here,  does it have a name?
  It's a bone saw.
  You use that  to cut into skulls, huh?
  Think for a second
  What you'd do  to get into a skull
  If you didn't work here.
  How would you do it?
  An ice pick's no good.  You have to stab it 100 times.
  A handsaw works,  but it takes forever.
  The best thing  i found is a rock.
  You made me this thing.
  I don't trust you.
  I may not think  you're a murderer,
  But i think you're likely  still the same  drug-dealing knob
  Who groped me on that boat.
  Oh, that's pretty clear.
  So it's every zombie  for himself, huh?
  I guess so.
  Hey.
  Hey.
  Is that a bottle of champagne?
  Wow, look at you,  all cop-like.  Nothing's getting by you.
  -Are we celebrating?  -I hope so.
  Otherwise, i'm gonna  get really hammered  two-fisting this.
  And what are we celebrating?
  The wally walker murder case.
  High-tech whiz kid  mugged and murdered  in a park. Heard of it?
  Nope, but here's  to wally's untimely demise.
  Oh. Uh, check this out.
  I wanna thank don watts  and freddy brown
  For helping to find  my husband's killer.
  Okay. So, that is  wally walker's widow.
  And, uh, that eye candy  is walker's angel investor.
  He offered a reward  for any information leading  to the killer's arrest.
  Oh, and, uh,  that compelling fellow
  Is freddy brown.  He collected the reward.
  Wait for it.
  Oh, my god! It's you!  In your power suit!
  (laughs) hell, yeah, it is!
  Ah. My first murder case.
  I... I'm officially on my way.
  The da is putting  a lot of faith in me. So...
  Can you help me prep my cross?
  Like old times, hmm?
  You get to play gus williams,  the murderer,
  A cold, detached loner.
  I think i can dial that in.
  Mr. Williams, when the police  picked you up,
  You had mr. Walker's wallet,
  Credit cards and shoes  in your possession.
  Is there a question?
  Oh, just the obvious one.
  How did these items  come to be in your possession?
  I was in the park  looking for a place to sleep
  And i stumbled upon his body.
  I took his shoes  and his wallet.
  It didn't seem like  he needed them any longer.
  Was this the man  you stumbled upon?
  Wait a minute, okay?  The money's coming!
  I swear to god,  i'm gonna pay it all off!  Just tell him!
  Tell him the money's coming.
  Marvin: That's what  they always say.
  (gasps)
  Uh, liv?
  I killed him.
  Hey, now, i'm not that good.
  So, wally walker trial  starts today.
  Big win for the cops, huh?
  Beloved tech innovator  mugged and murdered
  Just before his company  goes public.
  But the city's finest  get their man,
  A drifter with a record.
  The city is safe,  everyone's happy.
  It's not my case.  I'm working the hit-and-run,  remember?
  The poor schmo  that got run over  in the parking lot?
  Yeah. Here's the thing,
  The drifter didn't kill  wally walker,
  The poor schmo did.
  Marvin webster,  our hit-and-run victim?
  I had a vision of him  murdering wally walker.
  This is important.
  When you had the vision,
  Were you holding  an apple bong,
  Or did you just smoke  an old-school spliff?
  I'm not  screwing around, clive.
  I'm just wondering  if this vision also contained
  Winged horses  and a dancing pizza.
  I'm not saying  you didn't see it,
  But no psychic bats 1.000.
  You're going after  the wrong guy.
  And from what i could gather,
  He's done it before,  like, a lot.
  How is this guy  even connected to walker?
  Something to do with debts.
  You want me to go to my boss
  And tell them to stop  a high-profile murder trial
  Because the morgue medium  said so?
  The victim was shot  downward in the head
  From point blank range  while on his knees,
  That's not a mugging,  that's an execution.
  The drifter had  walker's dna all over him.
  He was wearing  his frickin' shoes.
  A homeless drifter  who needs to steal shoes
  Doesn't usually pack a glock.
  I saw the murder weapon.
  He used a suppressor,
  More commonly known  as a silencer,
  Invented by hiram  percy maxim in 1902.
  Fyi.
  Listen, our job right now  is to find the person
  That ran over marvin webster.
  It's up to the courts  to decide
  If gus williams is innocent.
  He is innocent.
  What more do you need  than, "i saw somebody else  commit the murder"?
  I need evidence.
  I can't go to  the powers that be with this.
  You absolutely can.
  You just don't want to.
  You'd rather send  an innocent man to jail
  Than rock the boat.
  Well, i'd rather  sleep at night.
  Don't worry, i'll man up  for the both of us.
  Liv: I just asked clive  to commit career suicide,
  And then i questioned  his manhood.
  And i genuinely don't care,  like, at all.
  Marvin webster had quite  the superiority complex.
  And zero empathy  and was a hit man.
  Son of a bitch.  I ate the brains
  Of a sociopath.
  A term eliminated by the dsm
  In 2004 along with psychopath
  And combined  into one broader category,
  Antisocial  personality disorder.
  Void of compassion.
  Full of factoids.  This brain is gonna suck.
  Hey.
  How's it going?
  Okay.
  So you haven't seen it?
  -Oh!  -Woman: Oh!
  (people laughing)
  -(jenga pieces clattering)  -(people gasping)
  I only saw it  because she tagged him
  And he liked it.
  Which i didn't realize  would sound so sexual.
  Sorry. (clears throat)
  Regardless,  this is social media
  For "we're an item," so...
  Did you know  that december 11th
  Is the most common day  to get dumped on facebook?
  I don't really know  what's going on right now.
  Uh, are you, like,  in shock or...
  No, i'm just...
  Nothing.
  So, you don't wanna mention  that her laugh is annoying
  Or question why  they're this frickin' excited  about jenga?
  Not really.
  Wow. That's impressive.
  Yet concerning.
  (cell phone ringing  and vibrating)
  -Hey, are you sure  you're okay?  -Sure.
  Hello?
  Liv: It's been  almost six months
  Since i called off  my engagement
  To the man of my dreams.
  And now, the day  i've dreaded is here.
  He's moving on.
  I should really  be feeling something.
  I guess i still  have my curiosity.
  That's something.
  Liv: If we're lucky,  that zombie photo
  Is just a dumb  teenage prank.
  Better safe  than the apocalypse.
  "the rising world  of waters dark and deep."
  It's milton, on lakes  and what hides inside them.
  There are nearly  8,000 recognized lakes  in washington state.
  This one's second biggest.
  It's... It's very interesting,  thank you.
  So, how's this brain  treating you?
  Like the lone contestant  on bizarro jeopardy.
  Aside from that,  i'm totally numb.
  Things that should upset me  just bounce right off.
  That could have its upside.
  It's actually  kind of disturbing.
  It's not like apathy,  it's colder.
  This is the brain of someone  who could kill people  and not care.
  (rustling)
  Wait. Did you just  hear something?
  Like someone moaning  the word "brains"? No.
  If you heard aimless  shambling of the undead,
  That might've just been me.
  You don't shamble.
  (grunting and rustling)
  We need to open this up a bit.
  You know, many hit men  have an antisocial  personality disorder.
  That's what makes them  good hit men.
  Yeah. Kind of makes me  long for the days
  Low blood sugar made me  a little bitchy.
  (snarling)
  There's something in there.
  (grunting)
  Marcy?
  (grunting)
  You know her?
  This is unbelievable.  Look at her, she's real.
  Liv: She looks  like a melted candle.
  Well, she's been in here  for months and she's alive.
  That's open to debate.
  Marcy was a fellow resident  at the hospital.
  She invited me  to the boat party
  Where i was turned  into a zombie.
  I went to her funeral.  Her mom was a mess.
  Are you sure it's her?
  Liv: I recognize the necklace.
  Her grandmother's pearls.
  Marcy wore them every day.
  I can't imagine  how awful this must be,
  Seeing someone  you knew reduced to...
  Just...
  Did you just throw  a rock at her?
  Stop that!
  Liv: Why? She doesn't care.
  Still! I know  your system is swirling
  With hit man brains,
  But let's remember  to "do unto others."
  Because that  could be me, right?
  We don't know for sure.
  But we're both thinking it.
  If i went too long  without eating brains,  that'd be me.
  Or maybe we can fix her.
  I'm guessing that  isn't chicken noodle soup.
  What if the deterioration  is reversible?
  I mean,  what happens if a zombie
  This far gone gets to feed?
  Marcy! Lunch time!
  (growling)
  That is what  we in the biz call
  An encouraging  parasympathetic response.
  Right.
  When we come back,
  Hopefully we find  a very confused  cardiac resident.
  Sound good?
  Liv: I can't control  what happens to marcy,
  But i can solve this case.
  And if marvin's brains  blot out the memory
  Of the girl who wanted  to be my friend
  And the ex-fiance  who still hasn't responded  to my apology text,
  I say bring on the sociopath.
  Some new information
  Kind of fell in my lap.
  Wally did have  serious gambling debts.
  Come help me  lean on his bookie.  Don't make me beg.
  I'll say it again,
  The wally walker murder  is not our case.
  The marvin webster  hit-and-run is.
  Whoever ran down marvin
  -Probably hired him  to kill wally.  -(sighs)
  Two murders, one case.  Come on, work with me here.
  You're making  quite a leap here.
  You got a name  for this bookie?
  Frank smith.
  What?
  Frank smith,  former seattle cop.
  Current owner  of smitty's bar & grill
  And bookmaker to  half the cops in the city.
  Great. It's a cop bar.
  Everyone'll have badges.  We'll blend right in.
  (jovial music playing)
  Welcome to whitey whitesville.
  How do you think  we're blending so far?
  I remember this place.
  We had our mu theta zeta
  Night in ibiza  electric wonderland
  With the omega sigs here.
  You should see this place  when the foam drops.
  This guy knows  what i'm talking about.
  Uh, low profile.  Let's go find smitty.
  Clive: Uh, is smitty around?
  Who wants to know?
  Detective babineaux, homicide.
  I'll see if smitty  feels like chatting.
  (crowd cheering)
  Welcome, masters!
  Trivia masters, that is.  (giggles)
  Get out your pens.
  -It's trivia tuesday!  -(crowd cheering)
  I dream of jeannie.
  Can you believe she was  the idealized female
  For these guys?
  When she got uppity,
  Just shove her back  in the bottle.
  What was the first western
  To win best picture  at the oscars?
  Good luck, masters. (giggles)
  It all comes back to being  called "master," doesn't it?
  Cimarron, 1931.
  Yeah, i'm horribly offended.
  Are you cool with me  naming our trivia team
  "piggy and the brain"?
  -Smitty'll be down in a few.  -Oh, thanks.
  Male dayak fruit bats  are unusual in what regard?
  "they can lactate."
  I'll be right back.
  Trivia genie: Your wish  is my command,
  If your wish  is for more trivia!
  -(all cheering)  -(exclaiming)
  Yeah, wally walker  owed me money, a lot of it.
  He died owing me money.
  Now, you mind explaining me  why this is your  frickin' business?
  Sorry about this.  You must be smitty.
  Well, let me guess,  you're babineaux.
  And the winner  with a perfect score is...
  -Piggy and the brain.  (giggles)  -(applause)
  We were hoping  you could tell us when you  last saw wally walker.
  June 8th, the night he died.
  He came in here and asked  for more time to pay.
  Cash flow issues, he said.
  Was that unusual?
  It wasn't the first time  he'd been in deep.
  But i knew he was good for it.
  He was gonna sell  his company for fast cash,
  Told me that  if i gave him two months,
  He'd double my vig.
  So, the man owed you  a lot of money
  And ended up dead  later that night?
  Congratulations.
  -Say cheese.  -(camera shutter clicks)
  -Hmm!  -Not now.
  Don't they have this guy?  Didn't he go to trial today?
  We're just going over it  one more time.
  Suzuki's your lieutenant, huh?
  He likes to get a few bucks  on the seahawks  from time to time.
  I should check in with him.
  Let him know  what a thorough job  you're doing.
  -Let's go, liv.  -(laughs)
  You know  he's stonewalling, right?
  He obviously knows something.
  Stop, clive.
  -You can throw away  your own career.  -Look.
  Look who won on june 8th.
  Clive: Marvin webster.
  He was here the same night
  Wally came to ask  smitty for more time.
  And he followed him out  when he left
  And then murdered him.
  Where do we go from here?
  (knocking on door)
  Yeah?
  Mrs. Webster, we're with  the seattle police department.
  We're investigating  your husband's death.
  We have reason to believe  the person who ran him over
  Might've been someone he knew.
  We're hoping  you might let us look through
  Your husband's  personal effects.
  It's about time.
  If this were my home office,
  My thoughts might turn  to murder as well.
  6,012 unusual facts,
  You and marvin  would've had a couple things  in common then.
  Mrs. Webster  was sure cool with us  poking around down here.
  Mrs. Webster doesn't mind us  going through his stuff
  Because she feels  like he has nothing to hide.
  She has no idea what he was.
  Or he was just  a mild-mannered  pest control expert
  And we're wasting our time.
  Nothing here.
  See if that lamp  has a three-way bulb.
  Maybe it gets brighter.
  -(bulb breaks)  -(sighs)
  -Guess not.  -Hold on.
  -(tires screeching)  -(marvin groans)
  (marvin screaming)
  (gasps)
  Clive: Liv?
  I saw the hit-and-run.
  It was definitely intentional.
  It hit him once  and then backed over him  to finish the job.
  The car that ran over marvin  was orange.
  I caught the first few letters  of the plate.
  I've got something, too.
  Look what marvin keeps  in his tool chest.
  It's glock, with a suppressor.
  The gun  that killed wally walker.
  How do you feel about telling  your lieutenant now?
  The car had  one long taillight,
  But i'm starting to believe  that there isn't such a thing.
  With the color  and the partial plate,
  I've still got 79 cars  that could've run over  marvin webster.
  Which is why i'm looking  at pictures of cars
  Just like they'll force me  to do if i wind up in hell.
  Hey...
  How about doing a sketch  of the taillight
  And i'll run with it?
  Kind of annoying that  we didn't come up with that  an hour ago,
  But i'm on it.
  Talk to you later.
  You're home early.
  Yeah, well,  your detective buddy  blew up my case,
  So there wasn't much to do.
  They released gus williams.
  Well, he was innocent.
  I have a pile of evidence  that says otherwise.
  Someone else  had the murder weapon.
  The gambling angle  was never fully investigated.
  You read my files, didn't you?
  My confidential file.
  You want me to feel bad?
  You would've sent  an innocent man to jail.
  No. (stuttering) you've been  a slug for months,
  And this... This is the thing
  That gets you off of your ass?
  Not your family,  not your fiance,
  Proving me wrong!
  It has nothing to do with you.
  No, no, no,  but it does! It does!
  (scoffs)
  I get that you had to do  what you think is right,
  But you could at least  feel bad about it.
  You just massively  derailed my career
  And you don't even care,  do you?
  Yeah, you don't.
  These brains i'm on  are the worst.
  My closest friend  in the world,
  And i couldn't even  muster up an apology.
  I was such  an unbelievable bitch
  And i don't even care.
  Well, you sound like you care.
  Because i know i should,  but i don't.
  The whole world's  behind 50 feet of glass.
  You could always eat  another brain.
  Mrs. Marian evans,
  Asphyxiation  in a nursing home.
  Sold.
  But i feel duty-bound  to remind you
  About wally walker.
  You eat her,  no more marvin visions.
  And whoever hired him  to kill wally  likely gets away with it.
  See, i know you're right,  and i'll rally, but, nothing.
  These brains scare  the hell out of me.
  I'm afraid of the person  that i'm becoming.
  You're cognizant enough  to worry.
  To me that says  you'll be okay.
  And it's not just wally  who needs you,
  I wanna go to the tank  tomorrow to check on marcy.
  I'm working on a safe way  to gather samples.
  And then, we search  for any sign of improvement.
  And if there's none?
  Oh. There's every chance  there will be.
  I'm just wondering  what plan b is here.
  Liv, i need your help.
  Jerome and i  have been upstairs  for the past two hours
  Getting a master class  in being ignored by the cops.
  I'm sorry i haven't responded  to your text message,
  -But things have...  -It's fine.
  Why do you need a cop?
  Tell her.
  My roommate  took his skateboard out,
  Said he was going  to the park  for a couple hours.
  That was four days ago.
  Major is a counselor  at helton shelter,
  A halfway house  for teen runaways,
  Delinquents, addicts.
  Yeah, addicts are the key  to a good party.
  Jerome's roommate at helton,  eddie cisco,
  Disappeared four days ago.
  He reported it to major  and now they're here.
  No, we're not just here.
  We've been riding the police  for the last three days
  Who've done  absolutely nothing.
  Did you file  a missing persons report?
  Yes. There have been  no follow-ups,
  They didn't even call  the hospitals.
  I've got to ask,
  Are you sure  eddie didn't just take off?
  He wouldn't be  the first shelter kid to jet.
  He was doing really well.
  His ipod is still  in its dock, okay?
  If you knew eddie, you'd know  he didn't plan on leaving.
  Is there anything else  about him to help me out?
  Like, places he'd hang?
  Eddie's a skater.
  He'd go to nine trolls,  this skate park near helton.
  He started  going less, though.
  Some scary dude  was hanging around.
  Eddie said people  called him the candyman
  'cause he was  passing out utopium  like they was jelly beans.
  If you were willing  to follow him back
  To his child molester van  or whatever.
  All right.  I'm gonna walk this over  to missing persons right now,
  Get eddie  to the top of the pile.
  Nice kicks.
  Section 8 of the flag code  states that the american flag
  Should never be  used as apparel,
  Although enforcement  of the code
  Conflicts with your  first amendment right  to freedom of speech
  As laid out  in the 1990 supreme court case
  United states v. Eichman.
  You didn't say  you was marrying siri.
  We should get going.
  You really think you can do  better than my boy here?
  Jerome.
  I'll see you around.
  -Yeah.  -I don't get it, man.
  You may hate looking at cars,
  But you're decent  at drawing them.
  1978 landau.
  Note the taillights.
  That got us down to one car.
  I found it listed  in the local car trader,  and guess what?
  The owner sold it the day  before marvin was murdered.
  Who did he sell it to?
  That's our guy.
  Are you sure it was my car?
  I can't believe the guy  i sold it to killed someone.
  Any information  you could give us about him  would be helpful.
  Well, that's the thing,  he was very specific about
  Not wanting to give his name.
  He wore sunglasses, a hat.
  He paid well over  what i was asking.
  The funny thing was,  i already recognized the guy.
  The guy's been  all over the news lately.
  There was another picture  of him in the paper
  A couple days ago.
  I brought it with me.
  Clive: This guy?
  The guy  who collected the reward
  For turning in gus williams?
  No, not him.
  -Him.  -Liv: Don watts?
  That's wally walker's  angel investor.
  He offered the reward.
  The car is probably  at the bottom
  Of a lake by now.
  The car still has  lojack on it.
  Does that help?
  Seattle suit factory,  am i right?
  Ever been to luly yang  in the fairmont olympic?
  She does women's high fashion,
  But she'll make  an exception as a favor.
  I could make a call.
  Let's talk cars, instead.  Yours.
  I have lots of 'em. Which one  you wanna talk about?
  Your 1978 landau.
  '78 landau?  Doesn't sound like me.
  We caught a teenager  joyriding in it.
  He claimed he found it  with the windows down
  And the keys in the ignition.
  It had marvin webster's
  Blood and hair  on the bumper.
  Who's marvin webster?
  Clive: A contract killer.
  We believe he murdered  your business partner,  wally walker.
  We know that this was the car  that ran marvin webster over.
  And we know that  you paid cash for this car
  The day before the murder.
  The man who sold it to you,  one patrick edward,
  Saw your picture  in the newspaper.
  And your dna is in the car.
  Liv: Hair follicles.
  You gotta watch those.
  Oh, that '78 landau.
  My client appeared here  as a courtesy.
  If you had anything  to charge him with,
  You'd do it. Let's go, don.
  I don't know. I...  I kind of wanna hear  how this story ends.
  Wally walker  was a genius programmer,
  But his gambling debts  were gonna sink the company.
  He needed fast cash  so he was gonna sell out
  To the boys in redmond
  Rather than wait  and go public,
  Like you wanted.
  You took care of the problem
  And made tens of millions  of dollars in the process.
  I do remember  the tens of millions.
  After marvin did  your dirty work,
  You decided to tie up  the loose ends.
  Cell phone records show  you were called
  From a disposable cell phone
  45 minutes before  marvin webster was run over.
  What was that call about?
  How would i know?
  I'm sorry, did you say  you found this  disposable phone
  On this hit man?
  No, i guess not.
  (sighs) but let's say  i did hit someone.
  -Don...  -I got this, harry.
  Yeah. Shut up, harry.
  I bought that landau  to restore.
  It's a classic, you know.
  The '78 landau.
  But maybe i did hit  something that night.
  Maybe i hoped it was a deer,  but i wasn't sure.
  Maybe i wasn't  thinking clearly
  And just walked away  from the car.
  But this  marvin webster business?
  Never met the man.  Good luck proving that.
  We'll be placing you  under arrest
  For vehicular manslaughter.
  You said he was  a murderer, right?
  Did you know  that i'm on the cover  of ranier magazine?
  I have a copy of it  on my desk.
  I was hoping  to get you to sign it
  Before we send you down  to walla walla.
  If i did run over  this marvin webster,
  It's just another example
  Of my tireless work
  On behalf of the good  people of seattle.
  This arrest may get me  elected mayor.
  How many days  do you really think
  I'll spend behind bars?
  Be honest.
  I'll give you a hint.
  It's a round number.
  I'll have you out  within the hour, don.
  Liv: Is he really gonna walk?
  If we can't prove a connection  between him and webster, yeah.
  Wait.
  I have an idea  how we can put them together.
  Get your vision cap on.
  You have no right  to be in my husband's car!
  You know what you can do  with this impound notice?
  My husband was a good man!
  And you've made him  into some kind of monster!
  She's lovely.
  Here goes nothing.
  (engine revs)
  All right.
  "my destinations."
  The last place marvin drove
  Should be where he was killed.
  That's where it happened.  It's a match.
  All right. So here's  where he was before that.
  Professional hit men  don't do business
  Over the phone.
  If he set up a meeting  after the first call,
  It could be any of these.
  Let's check them out.
  Liv: The last thing  i wanna do is
  Have another flood  of psychopathic thoughts
  Bringing out my inner bitch.
  But when popeye faces bluto,  out comes the spinach.
  If it'll up my shot  at a vision,
  Then let's pop the top  on the leftover cerebellum.
  Lots of dog owners,
  But so far no one  who saw don, marvin
  Or his bug whack mobile.
  How's it going here,  any good vibrations?
  Not yet.
  Uh, keep at it.  I'm gonna keep asking around.
  Somebody might have  seen these guys.
  Excuse me.
  (jovial music playing  on ice cream truck)
  (jovial music playing)
  You gave me a price, i met it.  We're paid up.
  Marvin: Anybody gonna miss you  when you're gone, son?
  (knocking)
  Sanitation worker: Gentlemen,  can you take this elsewhere?
  Truck's coming through.
  (gasps)
  Clive!
  There was a witness,  a garbage man.
  I couldn't see his face,  but if we can find him,
  We can prove that watts met  with the exterminator.
  All right. I'll track down  the sanitation crew
  That worked this street  that day. You free to join me?
  I can't.
  I promised ravi i'd help him  with some research.
  And no rest  for the wicked, right?
  Liv: I'm cold,  all the way through me.
  And the closer  we get to marcy,  the frostier i become.
  She may well be better.  (panting)
  You always feel better  after a good brain.
  Liv: I can see ravi's hope  for what it is, fear.
  He can't deal  with what it means
  If marcy hasn't improved,
  What we'll have to do.
  -But i can.  -Maybe she's fine.
  Because marvin was a hit man.
  And i can't help feeling  that's what this  chilly emptiness is.
  This is how marvin felt  before a kill.
  -Ravi: Marcy?  -(grunting)
  I'm here with liv moore.
  (stuttering) she worked at  the hospital with you.
  You were a resident there.
  Marcy?
  Liv: It didn't work.
  Well, we have  to keep trying to...
  (grunting)
  We have to kill it.
  Her. She's a person.
  She's a time bomb.
  What if she'd scratched  that kid who took the photo?
  What if someone stumbled  in here and fell in?
  What if someone lets her out?
  We'll transport her.
  To where, the morgue?
  The morgue  at the police station?
  You are talking  about killing somebody.
  What if that were you  down there?
  I'd hope someone would put me  out of my misery.
  This isn't you!
  This is that sicko  in your head!
  Do you remember  your hippocratic oath?
  "i will prescribe regimens  for the good of my patients
  "according to my ability  and my judgment
  "and never do harm to anyone."
  You're a doctor. You should...  (stutters)  where are you going?
  I'm looking for a big rock.
  Liv, come on.  (stuttering)  just let me do this biopsy.
  Come on...
  (grunts)
  (growls)
  (screams)
  Ravi: Liv?
  -A little help? (gasping)  -(growls)
  Liv! Liv!
  Throw me the pipe!
  Liv, it's the brains!  They're making you...
  (ravi screams)
  Liv!
  Liv!
  (yells)
  -(growls)  -(gasps)
  (choking)
  -(yelps)  -(growls)
  (panting)
  You're all right.
  You're all right.
  You're all right.
  -You can get your sample now.  -(panting)
  Ravi: All right.  We'll have to burn it all.
  The blood could be  a contaminant.
  I almost let you die.
  Yeah, but you didn't.
  Liv...
  I'm fine.
  You saved me.
  All that sociopath swimming  through your system,
  And you still found  your way through.
  This brain...
  It's not who you are.
  (cell phone vibrates)
  It's clive.
  He needs us both.
  Okay, i'm back.  I'm recording this.
  I wanna have a record  of your ridiculous allegations
  When i sue you for harassment.
  Fair enough.
  You wanted to get rid  of wally walker
  So you hired  marvin webster to kill him.
  And defamation.
  Clive: Wally's death  made you a fortune.
  Marvin likely figured out  how much you were worth,
  Got greedy,  demanded more money.
  So you killed him,  tied up the loose end.
  Who is this marvin webster  you keep talking about?
  The dead man who called you  on two occasions
  Just before you ran him over  in your newly purchased
  1978 landau.
  From a disposable phone  that you don't have.
  That's some  weak tea, detective.
  You might be right.
  And i'll need things,  like the address
  Where you and marvin met.
  Stone trail dog park.
  The kind of car you were  driving at that meeting.
  Silver, luxury, electric.
  Might even help if i knew
  You were wearing  a blue button-down shirt.
  Seems pretty specific.
  It is.
  But probably the most  helpful bit of information
  Is the conversation  our witness overheard.
  What witness?
  The witness who picked  both you and marvin
  Out of a photo lineup.
  From the witness' statement,
  "you gave me a price,  i met it. We're paid up."
  (door opens)
  He's here.
  Thank you.
  Do something, harry.
  Let's walk out, don.
  Don't you wanna stay and hear  how this story ends, don?
  It was garbage day, remember?
  Peyton charles,  assistant district attorney
  I'm authorized to offer you  this one-time only plea deal.
  Thirty years  for each homicide,
  But you'll serve them  concurrently.
  Get up and walk out, don.
  One-time only.
  With good behavior,  you could still have some  quality years on the outside.
  But if you walk out  of this room right now,
  I promise you will never  draw another free breath.
  The story ends, don,
  With you signing  that confession.
  (sighs)
  I have to say,  this is surprising.
  I never knew  orange safety gear
  Would be so flattering.
  I look positively rugged.
  You were totally convincing.
  You held that  coffee cup with real
  Blue-collar machismo.
  Now, that was thrilling.
  I'm almost glad  the sanitation officer
  Couldn't remember anything.
  So, how are you feeling?
  The brains are wearing off.
  I'm starting to feel  like my old self.
  That's good.
  I'm not so sure.
  Liv: Marvin webster's brains,
  The worst i've ever had.
  I've been a zombie for months,
  But i never felt  like a monster  until i ate marvin.
  But now that he's almost  out of my system,
  I'm desperate for another hit.
  Because when marvin's gone,  my feelings come back.
  And after  what happened to marcy...
  After what i did to marcy,
  Do i really wanna feel that?
  One bite will make it  all just float away.
  (breathing heavily)
  (garbage disposal churning)
  But i can't let it float away.
  Whatever i feel,  won't be a fraction
  Of what marcy went through  alone in the dark.
  Marcy was real.
  She was alive.
  She was a person.
  Oh. (gasps)
  Liv: And i killed her.
  (indistinct talking)
  That's the thing  about pain, isn't it?
  Really feeling it  doesn't make it stop.
  It just shows you  you're still alive.
  Jerome: Hey, have you guys  seen my friend?
  -No.  -No?
  Sorry.
  (woman laughing)
  -Hey, have you...  -No.
  Hey, uh, have you guys  seen my friend?
  Don't think so.
  Hey, uh,  have you seen my friend?
  Brother, i just saw him.
  -(stutters) are you serious?  -Yeah.
  Where is he?  (stutters) is he okay?
  Whoa, whoa, easy.  (stutters) he's fine.
  He's at a house party  a few blocks from here.
  -I'll walk you over,  if you like.  -(sighs) yeah.
  -Yeah?  -Yeah.
  -Is anyone waiting on you?  -No, it's just me.
  We'll have you  to him in no time.
  Thank you.
