 Psych (2006–2014): Season 1, Episode 10 - From the Earth to Starbucks - full transcript 
 Inspector Lassiter is depressed enough to seriously consider resigning on account of an old case he feels unable to crack as isn't even officially ruled a murder. Shawn decides to save his nemesis by solving it and cuing Lassiter enough to believe he can claim credit. The victim is an astronomer, the observatory project partner of Hugo. Shawn uses pa's gardener plant expertise to find foul, then infiltrates as (utterly inept) planetarium guide, teasing Gus whose secretly admired girl actually works there. Suspects include a stealing janitor and anyone who could know about Hugo's great ambition.

 Shawn: I need 80 cents.
 No, you don't. You need
to put back two of those
extra candy bars
 that you just picked up.
 Dad, you don't
understand.
 I can't put back
one of these.
 That would be like saying
one of these candy bars is
less worthy than the others.
 And I can't play
those kinds of favorites.
 All right, fine.
Enjoy your dilemma.
 In the meantime,
don't drag Gus into it.
 Thanks, Mr. Spencer.
 Henry: No problem.
 Switch places with me.
 No.
Why not?
 Because then
you'll try to take
whatever money I have left.
 And when have I tried
to do that to you?
 Wednesday and Saturday.
 Monday.
 Gosh, you guys
have scary memories.
 Next in line, please.
 That's you.
No.
 Shawn, come on. That's you.
 Okay, so, all of these?
 (ALARM BLARING)
 Oh, my gosh!
It happened here?
 The one-millionth customer.
 I'm sorry.
 Don't be sorry, kid.
You won!
 He won? He won what?
 All kinds of things.
Gift certificates,
that cool bike up there.
 Ladies and gentlemen,
we have it!
Our one-millionth customer!
 Can I use one of my
gift certificates now?
 Sure.
 Cool!
Isn't it awesome?
 Isn't this cool, Gus?
How lucky am i?
 Amanda: Thanks for doing this.
 Shawn: Oh, don't be silly.
Are you kidding?
 Go out spur of the moment
with a sexy gal
 who likes quirky dive bars
as a starting point
 (LAUGHING)
 But then is also
open to seeing where
the night goes, you know?
 You could've thought
I was weird asking you out
 because you walked
by my counter.
 I don't call that weird.
 I call that blind, dumb,
stupid, awe-inspired luck.
 (CELL PHONE RINGING)
 I'm gonna get drinks.
 Two vodka sodas.
 I've just decided
I am going to
experience life.
 You know, try new things.
 I signed up for
a painting class today.
 You know, they make
the kind of paint
you can eat now.
 And I'm giving
new focus to my job.
 So...
 can I ask you a question?
 Anything.
 Did you just get out
of a relationship?
 How did you know?
 Just a wild guess.
 Was it
 today?
 Yesterday.
 Are you sure
you should be out
dating already?
 Yes, of course.
 He was cheating on me.
 Cheating?
Yeah.
 And the stupid thing is
I thought everything was going
really well, you know?
 And then he just started
getting all weird
the last month.
 Lying, going
through my stuff,
 my address book, my jewelry.
 Finally, Friday he tells me
he's going to watch
the game at a friend's.
 A co-worker of mine
spots him over at
the Eastland Center.
 He may not accept
it yet, but we are
definitely finished.
 Thank you.
I hope you don't mind
being a rebound.
 Oh, I usually prefer it.
 But not in this case.
 Why not?
 Primarily because
he's not cheating on you.
 Look, he took your jewelry
because he's trying
to figure out your ring size.
 He took you to tiffany's
to buy that fancy necklace
 because he's really trying
to scout out what kind of
stones and settings you like.
 What about last Friday?
 Oh, come on.
The Eastland Center?
 There's no bars
or clubs there.
He wasn't there with a chick.
 He was probably
in the north side
of the parking lot
 at Robbins Bros.,
picking out the ring.
 My address book?
 Called your parents
to ask for your hand.
He's doing it right.
 Do you think
I should call him?
 I'll let you be
a psychic on that one.
 Ray? Yeah, I need you
to tell me the truth.
 If you lie to me,
we will never speak again,
do you understand?
 About Friday.
Who were you with?
 Take your time.
 Lassy?
 Spencer. Why am I surprised?
 Why are you wasted?
 Hey, do you
like scotch? Miss!
 (INAUDIBLE)
Carlton: Can I get two more
of these, please? Thank you.
 Listen, there is
something I have got
to get off my chest.
 Is it your shirt?
Please say no.
 You
 astound me.
 Come again?
 It's beyond astounding.
 It is some of the most
impressive reasoning
I've ever seen.
 Is there a punch
line coming?
Let's get to it.
 I don't know how you do it.
 I mean, it's not psychic-ness,
we both know
that's a crock of crap.
 But you, sir, are unstoppable,
 guaranteed arrest.
 What's happening here?
 Can I tell you a secret?
 I wouldn't recommend it, no.
 Listen,
 you know how everyone thinks
my wife and I have been
separated for nine months?
 Yes.
 Two years. Two years tonight.
 And I'm the one
who keeps trying
to fix the thing.
 I mean...
jeez.
 ...counseling, therapy,
acupuncture, you name it.
 I have tried to
try to try it.
 Well, I'm gonna
let you go.
 Don't drive.
 You know,
I used to be a good cop.
Seriously.
 Stunning arrest record.
It was one of the best
in the department.
 I caught the
back bay killer.
 Yes, you did.
I remember it well.
 Although I had a tip.
The blue sedan.
 Yeah.
 That was you?
 It might have been.
See what I mean?
 Come on, you still had to
put it all together, right?
 Look, Spencer,
the blue sedan was
the key to the whole thing.
 It was the murderer's car.
 Yeah, but who had to
run the plates?
 And all those numbers
and letters could have
confused many a cop.
 Spencer, stop, okay?
I am done.
 Here, I want you
to have these.
I don't need them.
 I am over.
 All right, just stop this.
This is nonsense.
 You're not over.
 Look, you're a
striking man with
strong features,
 eyes that women
want to do
cannonballs into.
 You have great posture
and penmanship
the likes I've never seen.
 No, I have officially
hit rock bottom.
 A month ago,
I got this case, right?
 A healthy 42-year-old
astronomer dies.
 Doesn't drink, doesn't
smoke, spends all day
 in an ergonomically-designed
chair, charting the night sky.
 Natural causes,
that's what the coroner
comes back with.
 Does a full autopsy.
No red flags. Nothing.
 I know he was murdered.
I just can't...
 what? What?
What is this?
 ...prove it!
 The department won't even
let me pursue it.
 Come on, you'll
figure it out.
 No, I won't. I can't.
And I've accepted that.
 All right, look, lassy...
 Carlton,
 I believe in you.
I really do.
 You just gotta trust
your instincts.
 (SHRIEKING)
 (LAUGHING)
 I just got engaged!
 Oh, my god!
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!
 (BOTH SCREAMING)
 I got engaged!
 (LAUGHING)
 Shawn: I'll never, ever
see you again. Bye.
 (THUDDING)
 Stick with it, lassy. You...
 you can solve this thing.
 You're halfway there already.

Gus: What?
 Hey, lassy.
 What is it, Spencer?
 How you doing?
You okay?
 All right. I'll bite.
What's the joke?
 Just want to make sure
you got home all right
last night.
 From what?
 From the bar.
What bar?
 You were at a bar?
No, I wasn't at a bar.
 I don't drink.
 You don't drink?
 Well, okay.
Wine at weddings.
 Occasional snifter
of brandy.
 Maybe a single-malt scotch.
 Sounds like drinking to me.
 Spencer, why don't you stop
making up stories, okay?
They're obviously bogus.
 Okay, so you were not
at Tom Blair's's pub last night?
 I don't even know
who Tom Blair's is.
 Mmm-hmm.
And how'd you get that sweet
bruise on your forehead?
 I had an altercation.
 Yes, with a table.
 Carlton: With a suspect.
 If we're done,
I would really like
to move on with my day.
 I get it.
 Yesterday was
 a tough anniversary for you.
 What?
 Who've you
been talking to?
 Nobody.
 I'll get out
of your hair.
 Okay. We gotta solve
that case.
 What case?
 The one Lassister
can't solve.
 He's gonna hire us
for a case?
 Oh, god, no.
He'd never do that.
 So, we won't get paid?
Exactly.
 And we're just
doing it for the glory?
Nope.
 We give Lassister
all the credit.
 In fact, I don't even
think he can know
we're helping him.
 Dude, that's
a good idea, Shawn.
 I ditch out of work
on the day we release
three new products
 to spend time
on an unsolvable case
 in which we won't get
paid and someone else
gets all the credit.
 That, quite honestly,
is some of the best
nut-shelling I've ever heard.
 We made a deal.
Yesterday.
 We're equal partners.
That means we
collectively decide
 which appointments to make,
which cases to take.
 We have to live by that,
at least for a day,
especially today.
 You're right.
Thank you.
 It's gonna be a
problem, though.
Why?
 'Cause we've already
got a meeting
with the dead guy's widow.
 When?
Ten minutes.
 Ten minutes?
Look, don't worry.
 I'm gonna do it
in the chief's office.
 Just need you to stand guard
at the door, make sure
no one catches us in there.
 It's gonna double
the excitement.
Maybe triple it.
 Now, come on, who's in?
 Don't fool around.
 You know I can't
hold my hand like
this for very long.
 Gus, I get very
poor circulation to
the limbic regions.
 And now my
pinky's going numb.
 I guess everything started
to change at the beginning
of last summer.
 He partnered with his
old friend, Hugo,
 and they finally
got accepted
for eight months
 on the new digital telescope
at the Space Center.
 Everything was normal
for two weeks and then,
 suddenly, Bryant
started to work
really long hours.
 I see.
 What do you think of this?
 I like it.
 It was a gift. A friend.
He's a glass blower.
 Would you say
that's when he started
feeling sick, Mary?
 Not sick,
just a little off.
 Oh! We did cancel
our Fourth of July trip,
 so I guess it was
around that time.
 I'm sorry,
something is really
bugging me.
 Your name is Lassister, too?
 Yes, that's correct.
Carlton Lassister.
 But you're not affiliated
with the detective Carlton
Lassister who I met before?
 Not in any way,
shape or form.
Different department.
 Matter of fact,
I spell mine with a "k."
 Two of them.
 Mary, is there anything
you're leaving out?
 Maybe something that's
slipped your mind,
 something you're
not telling me because
 it may embarrass
and/or shame you.
 It could be vital.
 I know this probably
isn't true, but I started
to suspect that he...
 was cheating on you.
 Well, yes.
How did you know?
 A shot in the dark.
 The long hours.
He was consumed
with his work.
 He was different. Distant.
I don't even like
to say it out loud.
 Please, don't.
 Bryant wasn't really the type.
We were planning a future.
He wanted to try for a baby.
 He was a good man.
 Thanks again for
coming in, Mary.
 No problem, K Karlton.
 If we uncover any...
Carlton?
 Yes, Karlton, with a "k."
 Two "k"s.
The second one
is silent.
 May I speak to you
privately in your
office, K Karlton?
 Certainly.
 We'll be in touch.
Thanks.
 What are you doing reopening
the vallery case?
 Reopening? Come on.
That word has
so many syllables.
 That case was determined
not to be a case,
 despite detective Lassiter's
best efforts.
 Shawn!
 Now, I need a
whole lot of an
explanation from you,
 because, although you do
make me laugh occasionally,
 impersonating an officer is...
 impersonating an officer?
Please.
 I told that woman
I was in accounts payable.
 Shawn, come clean.
 I would like to solve
this case for Lassister.
 He'll never allow it.
 That's why he can't
know I'm involved.
 I figure I can
guide him through
this thing, right?
 Build him up,
get him back
on his feet again.
 You're serious?
Yeah.
 Why?
 I just feel like
he really needs this.
 I mean, look at him.
 Okay, I'm in.
 You're what?
 What do you got?
 My dad is not answering
his phone.
So?
 So, he's always home,
and he always answers
his phone after two rings.
 This is actually
somewhat troubling.
 Why?
 Why? Fish derby is on.
 What is this?
 It's the Bryant vallery case.
 The one from this morning?
 And the rest
of the week.
 I predict we will solve it
Friday at 10:01 p.m.
 And then maybe
watch some cable.
 Sounds great.
 And did you find
a partner that's willing
to do this with you?
 Jules is in.
My dad is clearly
missing, or something.
 Dude, that leaves you!
 Gus, you get to step up
in a big fat way.
 You have one job.
I have two jobs, Shawn.
 I have presentations
to memorize
on three new drugs.
 And while you were out
drinking last night
and taking on free cases,
 I was up half the night
dreaming about
 whether the gel caps
are more effective
than the tablets.
 First of all, tablets.
Always tablets,
that's a given.
 Secondly, I've been having
this reoccurring dream
 where I'm flying over Auckland
on the back of a swan
made primarily of cocoa.
 His name is clem.
 But your dream was
pretty interesting, too.
 And thirdly,
I guarantee you that
after you hear this reason,
 you will definitely want
to take this case.
 I doubt it
but give it a shot.
 The victim was
an astronomer. Yeah.
 The guy died while he was
working the night sky
at the observatory.
 (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
 What would make you think
that would matter?
 Oh, come on!
I know you go down
to the Space Center.
 That's preposterous, Shawn.
Thursdays.
 I'm never down...
in the afternoon,
usually around 2:00.
 Have you been following me?
 Maybe. Sometimes.
 To sharpen and refine
my tailing skills, yes.
 This is exactly
the sort of thing
I was talking about, Shawn.
 Okay, I apologize,
Gus, I do. But
it's all good.
 So you like astronomy.
I accept that.
 This conversation is over.
 Okay, don't go all
Vincent Gallo on me.
 We're just getting
started, man.
 Look, some guy dies
at a Space Center that
you frequently sneak off to.
 We gotta get down
there and we gotta do
some serious space digging.
 No, we don't.
As a matter of fact,
 now that I know
that you're tailing me
while I'm at work,
 get ready to get
lost in my dust.
 Okay. Dust?
 What, are you
going off-roading?
 I'm gonna be un-catchable,
like a jackal.
 Like a jackal?
 How about I just tail you
to the observatory?
 Consider me stealth, Shawn.
 That's weird.
It's like you're
a bobble head.
 (TIRES SQUEALING)
 (CAR ALARM BEEPS)
 Excuse me,
I have an annual pass and...
 (GASPS)
 Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
 Didn't see you standing
there, you know,
being so stealth-like.
 (INTERCOM BEEPS)
 (OVER INTERCOM)
The jackal has arrived.
 Gus: What are
you doing, Shawn?
 What are we doing.
Dude, we're undercover.
 We are not
undercover.
Sure, we are.
 I'm the employee,
you're the customer.
 I am the customer.
 See? You're already
in character, like
don Cheadle!
 I'm not involved
with this case.
 I only need you
for a minute.
 Like when Kenickie
needed Danny Zuko.
 And you get to be Travolta
in the analogy.
 Tomorrow, they're training me
on the motion simulator.
 Tell me you've never wanted
to take a ride on one
of those things buck-naked.
 No, I haven't.
 Sure you have.
 I'm only here for
a few minutes, anyway.
 That's all I need.
 Shawn: Look, there's
this creepy janitor
that lurks about.
 I want you to distract
him while I grill
planetarium girl.
 You are not
grilling Jessica.
 She's just interning
here until she gets
her college units.
 Jessica?
Yeah!
 How do you know
her name is...
 (GASPS)
 Oh, Gus.
What?
 You haven't been coming
here on Thursdays
to study the stars.
 You've been coming
here for her!
 Do you love her?
Shut up, Shawn.
 You're in love with her.
Shut up, Shawn.
 I'm gonna go
hook you guys up.
No, Shawn.
 She is my co-worker
and I have the inside track.
 Listen, there are ways
to go about doing this.
 You don't just
walk up to somebody at
their place of employment
 and start working them over.
You've got to have a plan.
 Do you have a plan?
Of course I have a plan.
 Well, would you mind
clueing me in, please?
 All right, listen.
 She's been through
a lot lately.
She just had...
 broke up with
her boyfriend.
 How'd you know that?
It's my curse, apparently.
 Well, since she's just
off a break-up,
I gotta move gradually.
 Just go over there
and ask her out.
Get her digits.
 Shawn, this is a quality girl.
That means I got to put in
quality time, okay?
 Oh, here she comes.
Act natural.
 Hey, jessie,
 do you know Gus?
 Yes. Gus is
a regular.
 That's right.
 You know,
I went to high school
with him.
 Of course, I didn't hang out
with cool kids like Gus
in high school.
 He was a C.I.F.
wrestling champion
back then.
 Really?
 True as toast.
And in college,
he was a Heisman candidate
 till he blew his knee out.
 Don't act all surprised.
We were all following you
in the newspapers, man.
 You're kidding.
 Well, he is, actually.
I don't kid, ever.
 I idolize this guy.
The coolest dude
I have ever known.
 Wow, Gus, it seems
there's a lot
I don't know about you.
 Well, there is...
hey, you guys
should totally talk, you know?
 Share stuff and whatnot.
 But don't let this guy
grill you too much.
 (FORCED LAUGHTER)
 Yeah, well, I'd love to,
but I have to start
the planetarium show.
 Yes, she has
a planetarium show to start.
Oh, can I do that?
 Have you been trained
on the show?
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, jess,
I just did the checklist,
like, an hour ago.
 Perfect score. Uh...
 question 18 has a typo.
 Okay, great!
Go ahead then.
 Are you serious?
 Oh, this is great!
Great.
 All right, I got it.
No worries. No worries.
I got it.
 Thanks, Shawn.
 That guy.
You heard about Pluto?
 It's messed up, right?
Mmm-hmm.
 Here's the
Bryant vallery file.
 The what?
Wait... the astronomer?
 Yes, and I just finished
the follow-up with Mary,
the widow.
 You what?
You asked me to.
 I did?
It was in passing.
 And wow,
did it ever pay off!
 You were right
about the affair.
I was?
 Yeah, the wife
totally suspected it.
She what?
 That he potentially was
having an affair.
 Well, isn't that interesting?
 I want to re-interview
everybody.
 And get me a copy
of the coroner's report.
 I told you there was
more to this case.
 Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
 I will be your narrator.
 My name is aurora borealis.
 There are over 400 stars
 in our galaxy.
 Maybe more.
No one knows for sure.
 Many have said that
the universe is even larger
than the Indian Ocean.
 And that is why it is called
 Infinitum
 Staroctopusium.
 Ah, yes.
 Our glorious constellations.
There they all are.
Take a look.
 Over here we have
one with a guy
 holding some sort of thing.
 Over here, our beloved
olympic rings,
all seven of them.
 And here...
 here's one with a fish.
 You gotta name them.
 Notice straight...
 straight above you,
the hammer of Jeff.
 And over there
in the south...
 north.
North,
 you will see
monkey with rash.
 The Egyptians used to set
their clocks by him.
 Oh look!
There goes an asteroid.
Comet.
 Comet! It's what they named
that cleaning solution after.
 I know it may stink
when you leave it in the sink
 but, boy, oh boy,
does it clean!
 Is there a reason
you're standing
so close to me?
 Just looking.
 Yeah, well, that's
the great thing
about looking,
 you can do it from
far, far away.
 And now, ladies and gentlemen,
 I implore you to enjoy
 the majesty of the heavens.
 (EXCITED MURMURING)
 Hey.
 You work here?
 No, I just happen to own
my own Space Suit.
 (LAUGHING)
 A smart-ass.
I like that.
Get over here, kid.
 Do me a favor.
 Keep your finger
on the space bar
while I adjust this.
 Like this?
Uh-huh.
 You're gonna trust me
with this?
 I don't have
a lot of other options,
do i, Space man?
 I gotta be honest.
This seems like
a job for two, no?
 Sometimes it is.
 But once
the scope is in place,
all you got to do
 is watch the monitor,
hoping to catch things
that nobody else has.
 You know,
if you got a partner,
you can switch off,
 you know, rest your eyes,
maybe make calculations
on what you've seen,
 or just break up the silence
of staring into the unknown.
 So, where's your partner?
 Yeah, well that's
the bad part of it.
 He passed away
not too long ago.
 You know,
the buddhists have
this saying about moving on,
 honoring the work...
but I don't remember it.
 What I do know is that
I realize I'm too old to be
doing this stuff all alone.
 So, you're
continuing the work, huh?
 Bryant would return
from the grave if I didn't.
 You know, we petitioned
for five years
for use of this scope.
 And we got lucky.
No, no, no.
No, no. Don't touch, no.
 I mean, once you get
in here, you gotta find
what you're looking for, fast.
 We had eight months.
Bryant saw six.
 Eight months seems like
a good chunk of time.
 Not in astronomy.
 See, once you find it,
you gotta track it.
 Okay? And then it's
not a discovery
until you chart it
 and then it goes around
again and then you prove it.
 Must get lonely.
 I let you in
here, didn't i?
 Look, I just talk. You know?
I've got the gift of gab.
 Jeez, I'll talk
to anybody, I suppose.
 So, you still haven't found
what you're looking for, huh?
 No, but when I do,
you'll read about it,
believe me.
 You'll read about it.
 Jessica: My real goal is
to become an astronomer.
 See something no one else has.
 I don't even need to make
a big, flashy discovery,
or name a star,
 or become famous like
most of these guys want.
 Yeah.
 All I've ever really
wanted is to know
I made a difference.
 That's great,
knowing what you want to do
since you were a kid.
 That's a gift.
 Thanks.
 You know,
you're a great
listener, Gus.
 Oh, well, it's easy
to talk to you, Jessica.
I mean, it's...
 is something wrong?
 They've been in
there 45 minutes.
 So?
 It's a four-minute show.
 And that,
ladies and gentlemen,
is precisely why
 time travel is
not only possible,
but may have already happened.
 (ALL MOANING)
 (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
 Shawn: So, I met the
other astronomer.
 Nice guy. Chatty.
Hiding something.
 Something nefarious?
 I don't know yet.
How'd you do?
 Please, Shawn.
How do you think?
 (GASPING) digits?
You know this.
 Nice!
We're going
out tomorrow.
 It's all coming
together, man.
 Juliet called.
She ran our dead
guy's phone records.
 We gotta meet her
at the station.
 You bet, let's go.
Whoa! Not now.
 5:00.
Why 5:00?
 Gus, I can't just
leave willy-nilly
whenever I want.
 I have a job to do here.
 I don't care what the
coroner says. Healthy
hearts do not just stop.
 But you know what?
I got a golf buddy
who's a cardiologist.
 I'm gonna run
these by him.
 Mind the store,
I'll be back.
 (WHISPERING) hey!
 Okay, so we ran the home,
the work, and the cell phone
records of Bryant vallery.
 We got nothing
on the home phone, a few
strange hits on the work line,
 but when we ran
the cell phone,
we hit the jackpot.
 We found a number
that he calls, only
from his cell phone,
 all hours of the night,
way too often for business.
 Unless it's
monkey business.
Sweet!
 So we contacted
the cell phone company
for the name.
 The number is 555-019...
 where is it?
 Oh, here it is.
 555-019...
nine?
 Wow, that's good.
 Not really.
 Shawn: So, she had an affair
with a married guy
and probably lied about it.
 That doesn't
mean she's guilty.
 Shawn, you're confusing me.
You're the one who loves
to jump to conclusions,
 and you're not
even hopping
towards this one.
 Hopping?
It doesn't track, Gus.
 Why would she kill him?
She broke up with a guy.
 It's him.
He dumped her.
 So, why doesn't she
mention to you
 that her ex-boyfriend
just bit the dust?
 What's she gonna say?
"Hey, how's it going?
My boyfriend just died.
 "He might have been killed.
Maybe it was me."
 (IMITATES CHORTLING)
I doubt she chortles.
 Damn, she was so
damn good-looking.
 And she still is, Gus.
 Even if we have a who,
we don't have a clear motive
 and we certainly
don't have the method.
 We can't give up
on our other suspects.
 What we need to do
 (BEEPING)
 Is keep looking.
 You're gonna
set off the alarm.
 Clearly, I have
a security pass.
 They gave you
a security pass?
 They gave dave
the cheddar corn guy
a security pass,
 I merely stumbled
upon it by happenstance.
 And by happenstance,
you mean?
 I swiped it
from his gym bag
 while he was shaking
a milky way loose
from the vending machine.
 Damn it! I...
 what are you
doing, Shawn?
 What I don't
have is a key.
 Stallings: That's not right.
What?
 I'm sorry.
I just... i...
 I left my pogo stick
in there and I just...
 no, I mean you're
not doing it right.
 You gotta move upward
if you wanna get the
latch to disengage.
 Let me do it.
 Uh... don't you have
a key for that, or...
 for this room? No.
 Big bad Bryant took
it away a few weeks
after they got here.
 Why?
 A few small items go
missing and suddenly
everyone gets suspicious.
 Items such as?
 A watch. A comb. Some mail.
 Whose mail?
 The dead guy, Bryant.
 Did you read it?
Well, of course I did.
 You know, he became
quite a jerk. I don't know
if Hugo knows this or not,
 but he was dissolving
the partnership.
 Apparently, he had
some big plans for
himself. I don't know.
 Correspondence for jobs
he didn't seem qualified for,
 heading university
departments, nasa...
 nasa?
 Now. Who are
you guys again?
 We think something bad
went down in there.
 Yes, something bad
did go down in here.
 Shawn: Did you
see anything?
 No. But you know,
the dead guy, he changed.
 They were friends
at the beginning.
 Hugo was always
being nice to him,
you know?
 In fact, Hugo's the only one
around here who's nice to me.
 Brings me coffee
in the mornings,
 although he brings
it for everybody,
 all four of us.
 Three of us.
 Stallings, I'll be
nice to you,
just do me a favor.
 Stop stealing the gum
out of my locker. Okay?
 (CHUCKLES)
 You spotted that?
Sure did.
 Hey, do you know
how these books work?
 Oh, they switch up
every couple of hours.
One looks, one writes.
 Yeah, they do it
from dark till dusk
all the time.
 Hugo's here.
 How do you know that?
 He gets here
at the same time
every day.
 You could set
your clock to it.
 Hey, you should hurry.
You don't have long.
 Thanks, dude.
Uh-huh.
 Gus, come check this out.
What?
 Look, there's a page missing
from this logbook.
 I noticed it
the first time I was here.
 Look.
 June 21st.
 Gus: What does
the book track?
 It's like stallings said.
It's like, every manual
adjustment they make,
 who does it, which
guy was on the scope.
 See, it looks like they
switch shifts about
every two hours. Right?
 So, why remove this page?
 It goes from 8:39 with Hugo
to 10:42 with Bryant.
 So the question is,
what happened between 8:39
and 10:42 on June 21st?
 Some bad juju.
 We gotta get out of here.
 Why?
Why?
 Gus, someone finds
me in here,
I could get fired.
 Why do you keep
running like that?
 Jessica: Hey, you guys.
 Hey. What's up?
 Gus, about tonight...
 oh, if you have
other obligations,
that's cool.
 No, I just wanted to
see if we could go
at 6:30 instead.
 That's perfect.
That's even better.
 Look, I need to borrow
your motorcycle tonight.
 You can use
my little blue car.
 Oh, yeah!
Do that, Gus.
 I get a little nervous
on motorcycles.
 Settled! Bye, jess.
 Bye.
 Hugo: Think you
want this one.
 What's that
in his case?
 Tracking readouts.
 Dude, it's just a bunch
of paperwork. I saw it
at the observatory.
 Why does he keep it
locked up like that?
 That's a
good question.
 Morning, gentlemen.
You up already?
 I had to check
the timers on
the crab spray.
 You need any help
with that giant thing?
 Nah, I can manage it.
 Only got two more weeks
of this before my time's up.
 Might as well follow it
through to the end.
 You know
what that means.
 I have no idea
what that means.
 That means he's
not at his house.
 So?
 Shawn: Rainier's not exactly
a high roller, huh?
 Gus: No.
Look at that.
 It should say,
"welcome to camp something."
 Huh!
 Stargazing isn't the
most lucrative field.
 Well, you can make up to
a hundred grand a year on
the lecture circuit
 if you're a name.
 (GRUNTS)
 You're gonna break that.
 (GRUNTS)
 I don't think so!
 Whoa!
What?
 Oh, boy!
 What is this
awful purple stuff?
 They're flowers.
 Flowers?
It's a garden.
 It's a vegetable garden.
These are flowers,
weird flowers.
 What are you doing?
 Well, I gotta
check this out.
 Let Lassister do that.
 Gus, Lassister has
to come here on his own.
 And he has gotta be right.
 So, who you gonna get
to check that out for us?
 Well, who else do
you know who spends
all day in his yard?
 (GROANS)
 Shawn!
 Oh, you shouldn't have.
 Dad, we need to
talk business.
 You're not answering
your phone. What's going
on? Did you even check it?
 My phone's been fine, Shawn.
 I'm just a little
busy right now.
 Busy with what?
Things, Shawn.
 I have things.
 Woman: Henry, where
are the towels?
 Yeah, I'll tell
you in a minute.
 (STAMMERING) was that a woman?
You have a woman in there?
 What do you think?
 Where did you meet a woman?
 Are you really interested?
 (STAMMERING) it's a question,
dad. It's an enquiry.
 On the internet.
 Shawn, look, she's
a very nice lady.
Her name is Sylvia.
 She runs a catering
business, has two kids.
 Would you like to meet her?
 Oh, god, no!
Are you kidding?
 Good. Can we pick
this up tomorrow?
 Yeah, I'd be glad to.
 Good.
 (EXCLAIMS)
 You must have thought
your dad dated again.
 Honestly, Gus, I haven't
given it a lot of thought.
 It's been 15 years.
 Yeah, you know what?
It's fine. It's great.
Good for him.
 You wanna
talk about it?
 No.
Good.
 You left your plant there.
 I know.
Wanna go back
and get it?
 No.
 Okay, June 21st is
missing from the logbook?
 No, I'll check on
that right away.
 Sweet. So, does
Lassister need any more help?
 No, Shawn, he is on fire.
 He's already had the autopsy
test rerun, and he's contacted
every relative he had.
 Is that a personal
call, O'Hara?
 Yes.
Wrap it up.
 I think I'm onto something.
I think he was killed
by someone he knew.
 I gotta go.
 Bryant vallery opened
a safety deposit
box account in June.
 Was it around June 21st?
 What was June 21st?
 I don't know.
Didn't you say something
about June 21st yesterday?
 I've said so many things
in the last few days.
Refresh my memory.
 Dude, you look sharp.
Thank you.
 I've got one more
thing for you.
 What's that?
 You want me to wear a wire?
 Just this little
baby one.
 Look, in the event that
she actually did it, right?
 She's not gonna suspect you.
 Forget it, Shawn.
I'm gonna sit down with
her for 30 minutes,
 ask a few questions
and keep it cool,
just in case.
 Just in case she
didn't kill the guy.
 All right, here's
a compromise.
 Let me follow you.
No.
 Come on! From a
safe distance. It'll
be like, 30 yards.
 Consider me stealth, Shawn.
 Hey, be careful.
 You know, we have
a mirror in the bathroom.
 You seem jumpy.
 Me? Oh, no.
No, no. I'm excited.
 So...
 tell me about
this guy you just
broke up with.
 Exes? Ooh!
 Don't you know the
number one rule of
first dates, Gus?
 I'm very comfortable
talking about anything.
 Well, there's not
much to tell, really.
 Mmm-hmm.
 About a month in,
I find out he's married.
 Right.
 Just my luck.
 And then he kept calling.
 He actually thought
I'd be okay with the
whole dirty scenario.
 He just...
he wasn't the guy I thought
he was, in a lot of ways.
 (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
 Wow, that's...
that's great.
 Why?
 I don't know.
 Hey, I'm sorry about
having to go earlier.
 It's just everything
changed at the observatory
 and I gotta get to work
early tomorrow, so...
 what's going on?
 Well, don't tell
anyone, but
 Hugo and Bryant may
have discovered a planet.
 Get out of here!
Yeah!
 An extra-solar planet.
 About six months ago, I think.
 Bryant kinda clued me in
the night they found it.
 He was so excited.
 They had to track their
data, wait for the planet
to come around again
 and complete its orbit.
Right.
 So, it must be verified now.
 I mean, you don't
just call a press conference
for nothing, right?
 Hugo is over the moon.
 Yeah, he's gonna
be famous forever.
 Do you have any idea
how huge this is for
someone's career?
 Um...
of course he does.
 Shawn?
I was in stealth mode!
How did you find me?
 You knew he was
following you?
 No, not at all.
 Jessica, this is
a good thing.
 It means we don't
suspect you anymore.
 "We"? Suspect me of what?
 I didn't think you
killed him, Jessica.
Killed?
 And I hope this
doesn't create trust
issues for our future.
 We just needed to
establish motive.
 Dude, we totally
established motive!
 Well, congratulations,
Gus, whatever you are.
 You've got your motive,
whatever that is, but you
no longer have a date.
 No.
Shawn: Jessie!
 (GRUNTS)
 Jessica, hold on a sec!
 Gus!
 Man, that's twice!
 ...and to the Santa Barbara
space Center
 for the use of
their facility.
 I dedicate this to
my departed comrade,
Bryant vallery.
 (ALL CLAMORING)
Professor! Professor!
 When was the discovery made?
 The 21st of June,
 9:55 p.m., during a routine
changeover between
my partner and myself.
 While readjusting
some coordinates,
 I inadvertently made
what is certainly
the discovery of my lifetime.
 Which one of you
made the actual discovery?
 It was me.
We traded off chairs
every two hours.
 This was completely
by accident.
 Woman: What about a book?
Surely you'll have
a lot of book offers.
 (WHISPERING) Gus, you
know what this means?
 It's murder.
It's...
 no, it's motive.
 That's what I said.
 No, you said,
"it's murder."
 It's the same thing.
Motive, murder,
it's the same thing.
 No, motive is the
reason for doing it.
 It's in the same
family, Shawn.
 Shh! Shh!
Hugo: Now, this planet
 has everything required
for an earth-like structure.
 It has proximity,
it has the right orbit,
 (CELL PHONE RINGS)
It has its own
energy source...
 you've got to change
that phone setting.
 (SIGHING) jeez. Hello.
 Shawn, what the hell
do you think you're doing?
 Look, dad, I can't talk
to you about your love life,
okay? I can't do it.
 My love life?
You still on that?
 I'm talking about this
foxglove you left on my porch.
 Foxglove?
 Your little plant with
the dirty roots. It's all
over my welcome mat.
 That was foxglove?
What the hell is foxglove?
 Some neighbor's cat
could have wandered in,
 chewed on it and croaked
right in my front yard, Shawn.
 Some foxglove has
a chemical called
digitalis in its leaves.
 What, is it, like, poison?
It's a medicine!
 And you know how I feel
about dead things in my yard.
 Look, dad,
I'm sorry. I gotta go,
 I can't have two people
solving my case at once.
 Shawn, we should talk.
(SIGHING) okay, fine.
 I'll be at Tom Blair's's pub
on Friday. Come by.
 I got a date on Friday.
Can you do Saturday?
 Never mind.
 Digitalis is prescribed
for heart conditions.
 I don't see how
that helps us, Gus.
 It can cause toxicity
in someone who doesn't
have a heart problem.
 Wouldn't that show up
in the autopsy?
 That's the problem.
You have to test
for digitalis specifically.
 No one would consider it
if someone doesn't have
a history of heart problems.
 Shh!
 Hey, what are
you doing here?
 We just got our
motive for murder,
Spencer.
 Hugo found out that Vallery
was gonna take all the credit
for their discovery himself.
 Cut him out of it entirely.
 Because he was
on the scope when
they made the find?
 Yes. Maybe.
 What are you doing here?
 Well, we heard
you had the motive,
 so we rushed down here
to volunteer our services.
 Thanks, but I'll take
this one myself.
 Okay, well at least
tell me about the poison.
 What poison? I didn't
say anything about poison.
 You most certainly did.
I heard it.
 Clear as day.
Must have slipped out.
 I have been thinking
about poison as a method,
but I can't figure out how.
 Would you like me to
read your innermost thoughts?
 Like deep, deep, deep ones.
 Knock yourself out.
 Okay, I just
want you to relax.
 Breathe normally.
Close your eyes.
 (EXHALES)
 Can you feel it? Can... can...
 (GRUNTING)
 You want to check
the house, Hugo's house.
 (MUFFLED) I am in the process
of getting a warrant.
 What did he say?
 He's in the process
of getting a warrant now.
 The garden, check the garden.
 It's buried there?
 Something's growing.
 Oh, I'm getting something.
I'm getting...
I'm getting...
 oh, oh, oh... prince!
 No.
 The artist formerly
known as prince.
 (GRUNTS)
 Shawn! Wrong again.
 It's prince after he was
known as "the artist
formerly known as prince."
 It's purple.
Yes!
 Yes! That's it!
You're amazing.
 Oh, the caverns
of knowledge
in that thing.
 Here's the problem.
We ran the toxicology report.
 There's no trace of poisoning.
 Of course.
Thank you, detective.
 So what you're saying is,
he would've had to administer
it very, very slowly.
 Yes. That's exactly
what I'm saying.
 How do you poison
someone slowly?
 He brings me coffee.
Although, he brings it
for everybody.
 All four of us. Three of us.
 Coffee.
No, I'm good.
 Tea.
Well, if you're going.
 It had to be the tea.
The leaves wouldn't
stand out in the tea.
 Hugo poisoned his tea.
 Every day for six months.
 Digitalis would cause
arrhythmia in a healthy heart.
 Which would disappear
as soon as someone died.
 Solved it!
Shawn: No, you didn't.
 Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.
 Oh, that's right.
You did.
 O'Hara, call the coroner.
Tell him to check for even the
slightest traces of digitalis.
 And get me a new
pair of handcuffs.
 I've gotta be off.
 (ALL CLAMORING)
 Carlton: Hi. Thank you.
 Thanks.
 Just part of the job.
 Spencer, a moment
of your precious time.
 Are you sure
we should be in here?
 That night in the bar,
 I mentioned
my wife, didn't i?
 Yes.
Oh, crap.
 What did I say, exactly?
 That she wants you back.
 No, no, I don't
think I said that.
 Maybe I sensed that.
 You didn't sense it either,
but thanks for trying to help.
 To tell you the truth,
I think I got some help
on this case.
 Really?
Yeah.
 Well, hey, man,
we all get help
sometimes, right?
 It's the truly great
ones that know
how to accept it.
 And if I may add one
more thing, detective,
 you astound me.
 Second half to that joke?
 No.
No?
 The press is asking
for you outside.
 Tell them I will
be right there.
 To tell you the truth,
Spencer, sometimes
I astound myself.
 How's the knot?
Tight.
 Great.
 (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
 All alone, huh?
 That would appear
to be the case.
 It's a Friday night.
What happened to Sylvia?
 Would you believe
that I didn't want to
hurt your feelings?
 Sit down. Have a drink.
