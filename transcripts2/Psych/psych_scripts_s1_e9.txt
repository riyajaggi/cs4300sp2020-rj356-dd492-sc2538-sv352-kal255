 Everyone stay
together, please.
 Our next stop
is the primate habitat.
 You hear that,
Trish?
Monkeys.
 We're going
to visit
your family.
 Knock
it off,
Shawn.
 Now, some people believe
that the next animal
we're going to see
 is the ugliest creature
in the whole
animal kingdom.
 Does anybody
want to guess
which animal that is?
 It's definitely
got to be
Trish!
 I hate you,
Shawn Spencer!
 Shawn!
 BOY:
I wonder what it is!
 (OSTRICH SQUAWKING)
BOY: Whoa.
 Miss Bodansky,
I think the ostrich
might be choking.
 (CHOKING)
 Oh, I wouldn't
worry.
 I'm sure
it's just eating.
 Yeah, that's...
 That's how
they swallow
their food.
 I'm pretty sure
that's not food.
 A tennis ball,
Shawn? What are
you thinking?
 What are you doing
throwing a tennis ball
at an ostrich?
 The thing could have died,
and the zoo would have
made me pay for it.
 I don't even know
what an ostrich costs.
 I didn't do it.
I didn't throw the ball!
 Stop lying, Shawn.
You're only making
things worse!
 Maybe he's
telling
the truth.
 Are you, Shawn?
Are you telling
the truth?
 Yes, sir.
 Did you see
who did throw it?
 No, sir.
 But I think it might have
been an accident. I think
they meant to hit me.
 I believe him.
He's telling the truth.
 With all due respect,
Captain, you call the shots
at work, not here.
 You deal with your kid.
I'll deal with mine.
 You, scoot over.
 I believe you, Shawn.
 (CHILDREN CHATTERING)
 SHAWN: Gus!
What?
 Gus, Gus, Gus, Gus, Gus!
Come here!
 What?
Look at this.
 isn't that...
Trish Connors?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah,
and her dad.
 Whoa!
 Wow, she looks...
 Hot!
 I was going to say
vulnerable, maybe
a little upset, but...
 I mean, she was cute
in high school,
but she sure has grown.
 (EXCLAIMS)
 I wonder what Trish
and Captain Connors
are talking about?
 Why don't I just
read her lips?
 'Cause you can't.
Sure, I can.
 Shh!
 (IMITATING WOMAN'S VOICE)
''I'm sorry, father.
 ''I can't fight
it any longer.
 ''I love Shawn.
 ''I'm in love
with Shawn.''
 ''Stop pretending
to be insane,
daughter.''
 Daughter?
He calls her,
''daughter''?
 ''You know you
belong with Gus!
 ''He's smarter and funnier,
plus he has abs
like Bruce Lee.''
 Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa!
 Okay, okay.
 If we're gonna do
the lip-reading game,
 we have to say things
that are at least
remotely believable.
 I am.
''Abs like Bruce Lee''?
 Dude, they're
coming in!
 Act natural.
 TRISH: Hello?
Is anybody here?
 Oh, hey!
 Shawn?
 You probably
don't remember
me...
 Don't speak!
Oh!
 I'm seeing
a face...
 A face from
the past.
 We know
each other.
 Yes, we do.
 I said
no speaking.
Oh, sorry.
 We were
 classmates.
 Yes! Sorry.
 Did we ever kiss?
 No.
 I'm sorry.
 That image may very well
be coming from the
not-too-distant future.
 I'm getting
a name.
Connor!
 Trish?
 Trish Connors?
Wow!
 Look at you!
Oh, my God!
You look amazing!
 (LAUGHS)
What are you
doing down here?
 Wait.
 Why am I sensing
your father?
 Dad!
 (CLEARING THROAT)
Yes.
 Captain Connors,
it is so good
to see you again, sir.
 Please,
come in, guys!
 Sit down
in our cushy
chair!
 Dad, you remember
Shawn and Gus, we went
to high school together.
 I know who
they are.
 That's
Henry's boy.
 You don't have
to speak to me
as though I'm a child.
 Now, the
reason that
 we came
to see you
 is that there
is a...
 Um...
 Dad, do you
want me to hold
something or...
 No, no,
not now,
please.
 I have to just...
Oh, damn it!
 Nobody breathe.
I'm seeing something.
 Gus.
 There was
violence.
 Murder.
 Yes.
There was a murder.
 Yes, exactly!
 A murder,
a 187,
and I solved it.
 You bet your ass!
 So, what
do you need
us for?
 Because, damn it,
I can't remember
who's been killed!
 Or who
the killer was.
 Did you go to the police?
Oh, they're useless,
all of them.
 Without evidence,
they won't even
speak to you.
 Thirty years
I spent on
that force.
 But they still refuse
to believe me
when I tell them
 that there was
a murder, and that
I solved it!
 But I'm having
trouble
remembering...
 Actually,
remembering
anything.
 That's why
I'm here. To see
if you could...
 Maybe you could
look into my head.
 See what
I can't find there.
 But you believe me,
don't you?
 Yes, sir.
 I believe you.

 So, your Trish
says that this is where
her father comes
 every morning
for his coffee.
 He was here when
he thought he
saw the murder.
 So?
 So, maybe we'll
see something that
led an ex-cop to believe
 a murder had
been committed.
 Plus, double-chocolate
mango-pineapple scones.
 Apparently
made fresh daily.
 What I'm saying, Gus,
the morning is essentially
a win-win.
 Oh, no!
 What?
Little ''i''s.
 Gus, little ''i''s,
little ''i''s.
We gotta go!
 What?
Little ''i''s!
 What about Connors?
What about the double-
chocolate mango-pineapple?
 Forget the scones.
 There's only one
person I know
who makes the...
 Don't rush off
on my account!
 Dad!
 Shawn, you remember
my old captain,
Brett Connors.
 Of course.
Captain Connors,
 how are you, sir?
 Look at you fellas,
all grown up! How
long's it been, huh?
 About a day.
Less,
actually.
 Excuse me?
 Yes, can I help you?
 I don't know.
My name is
Sabrina.
 Vito.
 Sabrina Vito.
 And I think that
my boyfriend might
be missing.
 He hasn't called
and he won't
answer the phone
 and I'm a little afraid
that something might
have happened.
 So, l've been putting
these up all over town.
 It's okay.
Why don't you come over
here and sit down?
 Okay.
 Oh, that's right,
that's right.
 That's right, this chick
was sunbathing naked
in the plaza.
 No!
 You should have
seen your old man
 chasing her
with the cuffs.
 This gal was so covered
with suntan oil,
 every time he grabbed her
she squirted right out
of his hands.
 (ALL LAUGHlNG)
 CONNORS:
And that reminds me
of that 502
 that we picked up
that New Year's Eve,
over on Olive Avenue.
 How do you remember
all this stuff?
 Ah, it's easy.
Like it was
yesterday.
 Speaking of
yesterday, Captain,
 is this the table
that you
always sit at?
 Because I'm getting
something here.
 The murder?
 The murder?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you were sitting here
when you saw the victim.
 Shawn, what are
you talking about?
 Shut up, Henry.
I solved a new murder.
 And your boy here's
the only one
who believes me.
 Now, let the kid work!
 (STAMMERING)
I'm seeing a man...
 5'9'', 5'10'' tops.
 Shaved head.
 Yes! Yes!
 Yes, yes...
 His name...
 (STAMMERING)
Mif... Mif-you...
No.
 (STAMMERING)
May? Mick?
 Mike!
 His name is Mike!
 He was arguing
 over in the park
 with that
bastard
Mort Crocker.
 A mountain lion...
 He pinned it
on a mountain lion!
 Now, if l
can just
prove it...
 All right, look,
why don't I play psychic
here for a moment?
 It wasn't a young man.
It was a young woman.
 She's pretty.
Brunette hair,
nice figure,
 she liked to
play Scrabble
with her friends.
 Her name was Zoe.
 Yeah,
 you're right.
 That's who
was murdered.
 They said it was
a mountain lion,
but they were wrong!
 Dad, you're
amazing!
 Maybe my
psychic gift
is hereditary.
 Shawn, Zoe Sharp
is a young woman
 who was found dead
20 years ago, mauled
by a mountain lion.
 Connors and l
worked the case.
 So, she was murdered?
 She was in
the wrong place
at the wrong time.
 A tragedy, yes.
 A murder? No.
 Not then,
and not now.
 Okay, okay,
let's forget Zoe Sharp,
may she rest in peace.
 But Connors still
saw the guy on
the ''Missing'' poster
 arguing with
Mort Crocker
in the park.
 What?
 Shawn, we have no idea
what Connors saw
or what he didn't see.
 The man is ill.
Early-onset
Alzheimer's.
 His mind, the past,
the present,
it's all screwy.
 It's all the same to him.
So, he sees Crocker
standing there in the park.
 It triggers an old
memory of Zoe.
 Next thing you know,
he's living
in the past.
 Dad, this guy's your friend.
He came to me for help.
 Shawn, leave him be.
 He doesn't need your help
to make him look
like an old fool.
 He deserves
better than that.
 Shawn!
 Run, little alien!
Run!
 Shawn!
 What?
You're gonna want
to see this.
 See what?
Look!
 Uh...
 Coincidence?
 I don't think so.
 So, when my dad said
he solved a murder,
 you think this is the guy
that was killed?
 Well...
 It seems like
a simple question,
doesn't it, Trish?
 I'm afraid the
answer is a bit more
complicated.
 You see, as a psychic,
it is important that l
elicit the proper...
 (lMlTATES WHlP)
 I'm sorry. Raise your hand
if you want to know how
my amazing gift works!
 Gus, you're so
much better at this.
 Why don't you
tell Trish how
it works.
 l've got some
stuff I need to do.
 Sure.
 The answer to your
question is yes, we do
believe that is the victim.
 Please.
So, what's
the next step?
 Well, being that
the authorities believe
 he was killed
by a mountain lion,
 Shawn is going to
 attempt to elicit
 a psychic link
with this suspect,
 in order to establish
his guilt or innocence.
 And by suspect,
you mean...
 The mountain lion, yes.
 Amazing.
 Not really, it's...it's...
It's fairly common
for a psychic
 to be able to read
different species
of the animal kingdom.
 No, not that.
 What?
 The way that
he's sitting there
so quiet.
 I mean, in high school
he was always so loud,
 and needed
attention
constantly
 and needed
to be noticed.
 And he just
would not shut up!
 He was so annoying.
He drove me nuts!
 But now...
 I mean,
look at him,
he's so...
 Calm,
so unobtrusive.
 And the way he let you
just step in and
take over like that.
 I think he's
really matured.
 Yeah, yeah, he has.
 Dad!
No! No!
 He was mauled
by a mountain lion.
 You don't find that
the least bit
coincidental?
 Of course it's
coincidental, Shawn.
 But it doesn't
make it murder.
 No, it makes it an episode of
When AnimaIs Attack.:
Santa Barbara.
 Yes, well, mountain lions
do attack in
Santa Barbara.
 In fact, you watch
the news, right?
 That's your source
of psychic information?
 It happens.
 Connors came to me.
He says,
''I solved a murder.''
 Shawn, Connors
was a good cop.
 And the thing
that made him
a good cop
 is that he never
accepted the
easy answer.
 But that doesn't
mean that he was
always right.
 Obviously somewhere
in his mind,
 he's confused something
that happened
20 years ago
 with something
that's happened
today.
 Okay, fine.
 Talk to me
more about
20 years ago.
 How does Zoe Sharp
connect to
Mort Crocker?
 (SlGHlNG)
 Mort Crocker founded
the Mort's family
restaurant chain.
 He was the CEO.
 At the time, Zoe Sharp
was his assistant, and
there was a rumor...
 A rumor!
 That they were
having an affair.
 Nice, that's
good stuff!
 And Connors
knew about it?
 Of course he knew about it.
 Every good cop makes it
his job to know about
things like that,
 but there was
never any proof,
Shawn. No proof!
 And even if there was,
somewhere in some
corner of his mind
 there is a memory,
a lingering memory,
 searching
for closure.
 But then he sees
Mike here arguing
with Mort Crocker.
 Connors is not the most
reliable witness, Shawn.
 Dad, he's onto
something.
 One mountain lion,
two mountain lions!
 Mountain lions!
You're right.
 You should talk to
a mountain lion.
 (GROWLING)
 Whoa!
 (IMITATING JAMES EARL JONES)
Simba! I am your father.
 I don't think
Mufasa said that.
 Ah, Mufasa, Vader,
I'm Not Rappaport,
 it's all James Earl Jones.
 I'm Not Rappaport
was Ossie Davis.
 It still works.
 We're not even
supposed to be
in here.
 Relax. I love cats,
and it's been proven
that cats love me.
 Well, this cat
likes to eat people.
 Here,
kitty, kitty, kitty.
 You're not going
to eat anybody...
 (ROARS)
 No!
 What's going
on here?
 Who authorized you
to be in here?
 Uh...
 (IMITATING SWEDlSH ACCENT)
Please, excuse us.
 I am
Dr. Hans Jorgenson,
 and this is my very
distinguished colleague,
Dr. Mc...
 (MAKlNG CLICKING NOISES)
 Tock.
 I am so sorry.
I wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.
 Yeah, we have
arrived early.
 Well,
I'm happy
you're here.
 I'm Joan Walker,
the zoo director.
 Oh, let's see.
 Oh, look!
Dr. Hans Jorgenson.
 Look what they
have done for us!
Dr. Mc...
 Dr. Mc...
 (MAKES CLICKING NOISES)
 Tock.
 Dr. Mc...
 (MAKES CLICKING NOISES)
 Tock.
 Mmm.
 Oh, what?
 Oh, it is nothing.
 You see, the Kosov
language is very
difficult to master, yes?
 It seems you have, uh,
inadvertently uttered
a vile Kosov obscenity.
 Oh, I am
terribly sorry.
 Don't worry.
 My colleague only speaks
the English at a very
pre-school level,
 and he is very
forgiving of others.
 For instance, yesterday
I poured a hot cocoa
over his genitals,
 and I say,
''I'm sorry,''
and it's fine.
 Now, is that
the man-eating lion
 that we have
read so much about?
 No, no.
He's not
a man-eater.
 No, no, if he attacked,
it's only because
he was malnourished.
 So, tell us.
Why is the cat
so malnourished?
 I really don't know.
I mean, we had record
rainfall this year.
 There's an abundance
of foliage for his prey
to feed on.
 He should be fat,
but he's underweight.
 Perhaps it is because
everyone in California
is on the diet?
 Yeah? All of the
surfing boys and
the model girls.
 I mean, someone, anyone,
please give them
a sandwich, yeah?
 (PHONE RINGING)
Meatball,
uh-huh?
 What is that?
 The cat doesn't
look like it's
eaten in weeks.
 Doesn't make sense.
 Yes, this is Joan.
 Oh, well,
where's Dr. Zamfir?
 Actually, no, no,
stay right there.
 I might have someone
who can help us.
 Seems we have
a bit of a situation.
 One of our warthogs is ready
to give birth, but our vet
is away on an emergency.
 Could you please ask
Dr. Mc... The doctor,
 if, as a
distinguished
veterinarian,
 he would please
help us bring a new
warthog into the world?
 Please excuse
while we confer.
 (BOTH MAKlNG CLICKING NOISES)
 Meercat...
 (MAKlNG ANlMAL SOUNDS)
 (IMITATING BABY CRYING)
 He would be
honored, yes.
 So, just
lead us the way.
 Thank you, thank you.
 What are you doing?
 We don't know anything
about delivering
warthog babies!
 Oh! A baby is a baby,
you just pull it out
at the right time!
 The real question is,
are you allergic
to placenta?
 Oh, God! My eyes!
My eyes!
 (SPLUTTERING)
 Again, Mr. Crocker,
thank you for coming in.
 I know how hectic
your schedule is.
 Don't mention it,
Detective Lassiter.
 I'm never too busy
to help Santa Barbara's
finest.
 Why don't you
tell me what
this is about?
 Did you see this
in the paper?
 Yes, I did.
Sad.
 We have information that you
were seen with the victim
 the day before
his body was found.
 No, it wasn't me.
 Why don't we just
cut to the chase?
 It was that detective,
Connors, wasn't it?
 20 years and he still
can't let it go.
 I really can't say.
 Mike's body
was found
on this trail.
 It's closed.
Now what?
 Just hold on,
let me think
a minute.
 Okay.
 I have a plan.
 It's a
little crazy,
 but it might
just work.
Okay.
 What?
 Dude,
we totally made it.
We're in!
 Shawn, in case
you're confused,
 ''closed'' means,
''go away.'' ''Stay out.''
 Yes, in the negative
language dictionary,
 which is clearly
the only edition
you own.
 But in the positive
language edition,
 closed means, ''Come in,
step over the chain,
 ''there's so many less people
to trample all over
what you're looking for.''
 You really think
you can track
the animal?
 Perhaps you've
forgotten about my
extensive experience
 with the Native Americans,
a proud and solvent people.
 Working at the
Flaming Tomahawk?
 So, you
do remember.
 Shawn, you were
a greeter in
the casino, for a week.
 The only non-Native American
to be awarded
an eagle feather.
 Always remember
that, Gus.
Oh, please!
 Black lab! Akita!
 Lizard.
 Okay, now you're just
making stuff up.
 Flamingo.
 What if we do find these
mountain lion tracks?
What then?
 Well, we clearly follow them
to the kill zone
and look for clues.
 What kill zone?
 What?
 Feline concoIor.
It's Latin for
mountain lion.
 (SNIFFS)
Let's follow them,
and see where they lead.
 This is it!
What?
 The kill zone.
 The kill
happened here.
 Except...
Except what?
 Except the drag marks
are coming from
that direction.
 The lion tracks
we followed are
over there.
 If this lion dragged
and killed its prey,
 the tracks and
the marks
should match up.
 They should
come from
the same direction.
 Gus, you know
what this means?
 The murder
didn't happen here!
 Exactly.
 This cat was framed.
 I guess you
guys can't read.
This area is closed.
 What are we
doing here?
 I'm burning up
in this thing.
 No you're not.
Yes, I am.
 You've been wandering
lost in the woods
for two nights
 and you're
suffering from
extreme hypothermia.
 Now, shiver!
 How are you
feeling? Better?
 Oh, Ranger De Soto,
this soup is amazing.
 Gus called it
a chowder, and I'm
tempted to agree.
 Do you think you might
have any crackers
to go with it?
 Perhaps those
little oyster kind?
 l'll check.
 You're too kind.
 Crackers? Really?
 For someone who supposedly
drinks his own urine,
 your palate is
suddenly very
sophisticated.
 Let's get out of here!
 We can't.
 We've got
work to do.
 I think there's more
to this gun-toting ranger
than meets the eye.
 Like what?
 Well, for starters...
 He just happens to know
the infamous Mort Crocker
and his wife, Edna.
 Coincidence?
 Shawn, it's
a fundraiser.
 The Crockers
probably posed with
everybody in there.
 What about
the giant cage
outside?
 What about it?
 I suspect that
at one point,
 our man-eating mountain lion
was kept in that cage,
and sustained a small cut.
 Yeah, when they trapped him
and took him to the zoo.
 Sorry, all I have
is saltines.
Is that okay?
 Oh, believe me,
when you're starving,
you'll eat anything,
 including the poop
of indigenous beasts.
 Speaking of which,
when we were
lost out there,
 Gus here was
little-girl-scared
 that we might be
eaten by some
kind of wild animal.
 Does that sort
of thing ever
really happen?
 Well, it's not unheard of.
 Fact is, we had a guy
killed by a mountain lion
just a couple of days ago.
 Does that
kind of thing
happen often?
 Oh, a few times
in the past 50 years.
 I thought mountain lions
were afraid of humans.
 Generally, but if
they get hungry enough...
 We've had a really
dry year, that means
reduced vegetation,
 and reduced vegetation means
fewer deer and the like
for the lions to feed on.
 You can't really
blame the cat.
 It gets hungry
and it wants to eat.
 You mind if I ask you
a question that's
completely unrelated?
 Sure.
 Is that real
mahogany?
 Now, what
do we know?
 We know there was
plenty of rain
this year,
 no reason for a mountain
lion to be malnourished.
 Why was
Ranger De Soto lying?
 Why do people
usually lie?
 He's hiding something.
 Henry Spencer
back from lunch yet?
 Henry Spencer?
 I'm sorry,
who are you?
 Never mind.
 Just tell him
to come and find me.
 We need to go over
that Zoe Sharp file again.
 Whoa!
Excuse me, sir.
 You can't go
back there!
 What the hell
is all this?
 Captain Connors?
 Yeah.
 May I help you?
This is my desk.
 Look, son. I don't know
who the hell you are,
but you're confused.
 This is my desk.
It's been my desk for years.
 Now, you can either help me
find the Zoe Sharp file,
or take a hike.
 You know what?
 Maybe there's
someone we should call.
 Hey, look, I don't have time
for all this crap.
l've got work to do!
 Sir, please.
Don't make
this difficult.
 Hey, you wanna
dance, pal?
 You just name
that tune.
Come on!
 I don't know,
Shawn.
 Accusing Crocker
of murder's a
pretty big deal.
 It doesn't bother you
that we're missing
things like motive,
 where the murder
took place, or any kind
of evidence or proof?
 News flash, Gus,
the cops think
I'm a psychic.
 I just have to get
a feeling at
the right time.
 Shawn! Gus!
What are you
doing here?
 My father,
he's disappeared.
 MAN:
Hey!
 Come on.
 Where?
 (GRUNTS)
 All right, now you are
starting to piss me off,
old man.
 Come here!
 It's time
for you to go.
 Henry! Henry!
 Tell them
who I am!
 Um...
I think he's
talking to you.
 Oh, God, please tell me
I don't look anything
like my father.
 You could be his twin.
 Look at the back
of my head. Is my hair
starting to thin at all?
 Shawn!
Henry!
 I think we all
know who this is.
 This is
Captain
Brett Connors,
 one of the
finest cops
in the SBPD,
 someone I'd
be happy to share
a squad car with.
 What the hell
is going on,
Spencer?
 This man happens
to be my friend,
now let him go.
 He's your
responsibility. Get
him out of here.
 Let's go,
Captain.
 I should report
them all to
Internal Affairs.
 They should be
brought up
on charges.
 I couldn't agree more.
You head home, l'll draw up
the paperwork.
 That's
the girlfriend.
 I'm sorry
to disturb you.
 Was his
name Mike?
 Yeah, it was.
 How did you know?
 Shawn Spencer,
police psychic.
 I know that this
must be a very
tough time for you.
 Sabrina.
Sabrina...
 I am so sorry
for your loss.
 You know, he'd
come all this way.
 Lived so much, and his whole
life can be condensed
into a few items in this box.
 Mike wasn't
from here, was he?
 No, no, he was visiting.
 Yeah, that's right.
We were both from
Pennsylvania.
 Mike came out here
to search for his
birth parents.
 I am sensing
a longing.
 He was so sad
the first time
he called me.
 He just found out
that his birth mother
had been dead
 for almost
20 years.
 And that would
explain the sadness
that I'm feeling.
 But then a few days
later he called to say
 that he thought
he had located
his birth father.
 I'd never heard
him more excited.
 Did Mike bring another
pair of shoes with him
on this trip?
 No, no.
Just what he
had on him.
 It was pretty sudden,
this trip out here.
 I see.
 Sabrina, I'm feeling
that Mike does not
want you to be sad.
 Can you tell me,
 did Mike get to meet
his birth father?
 He said he was
a really wealthy man
and difficult to get to.
 Yes.
 Yes, he did.
 A biotin deficiency
can be hereditary.
 It's not exactly
a paternity test,
 but let's see if
Crocker has the
same prescription.
 If so, we know
Connors is right.
 This is
a fortress.
 We need a plan.
 I don't think we can exactly
just ring the buzzer
 and ask to peek
into Mr. Crocker's
medicine cabinet.
 Why not?
That sounds perfectly
reasonable to me.
 Why can't we be
from the state board
 of medicine cabinet
inspectors?
 I don't know, Shawn.
 I know I'm right
on this one.
 Let's think
this through.
 No, Gus. Come on,
let's go in
without a plan,
 flying by the
seat of our pants.
 It'll be so much
more fun, trust me.
 See, look, man.
There's some kind of
commotion happening here.
 Planning a party.
It's a piece of cake.
 They're never going
to notice us.
 Excuse me,
where are
your badges?
 Oh, I don't need
a badge, I'm the
event planner.
 The event
planner's
a woman.
 Yeah, I'm her
assistant.
 Also a woman.
 To the
assistant.
 I'm calling
security.
 No, no, no, no!
You don't need
to do that.
 Don't tell me what
to do. The rules are
very strict here.
 Really? You're going
to let your bosses
run you around like that?
 You're gonna
let the man
hold you down?
 These freak bastards
with their rules
and regulations?
 You're a human person!
 You need to rise up
and tell them all
to go to hell.
 We can all
do it together!
Let us empower you.
 I'm Edna Crocker,
 and you are one minute
away from a
squad car ride.
 Probably ought
to let this one go.
Yeah.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 I'm here to pick up
a prescription
for a Mr. Crocker,
 Mort Crocker.
 One moment, please.
 Thank you.
 See, you should
listen to me
every once in a while.
 That's not fair.
 I don't have access
to medical files
and doctor's names.
 Shawn, I called
two pharmacies,
 while you were
being interrogated.
 I don't have anything
for Mr. Crocker.
 (SNIFFING)
 Are you sure
about that?
 Yes.
 Um...
 Can I just
get back there
for a second?
 I'm sorry,
we don't
have anything,
 and someone has already
picked up all of his most
recent prescriptions.
 Is it that bastard,
Jimmy Derukie?
 Shawn, please.
 l'll tell you what,
before I go
a little nuts,
 why don't you just
give me the name
 of the prescriptions
and we can get
out of here.
 Okay, okay, see,
it's a long-standing
prescription.
 It needs to be renewed.
No one's gonna
go nuts here.
 (CLEARING THROAT)
 (STAMMERING)
Okay, no, I do
have something,
 but they picked
that up over
two months ago.
 Really?
 What was that?
The penicillin?
 No, it was his
regular dosage of
something called...
 Biotin.
 Yes, is that what
you're looking for?
 Yes. Thank you.
 All right, Spencer.
 You said you found
an eyewitness for
Mike McMillan's murder.
 Where is he?
 Okay, Mike.
Go ahead.
 Tell the detectives
exactly what
you told me.
 You're kidding
me, right?
 And we're
out of here.
 Mike says he was in town
searching for his
natural birth parents.
 If you don't believe him,
you can ask his girlfriend.
 That's true.
She told me.
 Did she also tell you
that he found
his birth father?
 Well, what about his
birth mother? Did Mike
say if he found her?
 No, no.
He didn't
say anything.
 See, he can't.
 He's a picture on a piece
of paper, and dead.
 You should be
ashamed
of yourself.
 Mike said his mother
was killed 20 years ago,
 right after
he was born.
 Her name was Zoe Sharp.
 I knew it.
 That son of a bitch.
 He killed her and now
he got rid of the baby!
 He protects his business,
his reputation,
 and he doesn't have
to share his wealth.
 Sounds like a motive
for murder to me.
 Really?
Yep.
 Then how do
you explain the
mountain lions?
 Huh? You're so smart?
How do you explain that?
 Lassi, why are you
asking him?
 He was just a baby
when his mother
was killed.
 In fact, he wasn't
even there.
 Summer of '86
was hot and dry.
 There were
a lot of fires.
 Lions were all
going hungry.
 I remember some of them
came right into town
looking for food.
 Crocker killed Zoe
and dumped her body
in the hills.
 He didn't know
about the lions,
that just happened!
 They ate the evidence
and covered his tracks!
 He just got lucky!
 What about
this time?
 With Michael,
he just got
lucky again?
 No, not this time.
This time he had help.
 Ranger De Soup...
(QUIETLY)
De Soto!
 De Soto
provided
the lion.
 De Soto?
I know that name.
 I just can't
remember why.
 Sir, it's okay.
 Well, I got to
hand it to
you, Spencer.
 This is a
terrific story.
 There's just
one problem.
 Sir, it's nothing
that Mike can't help
us work through.
 What is it?
Crocker has
an airtight alibi.
 He was in Chicago
when Mike was killed.
 Oh, he's lying.
 No, I checked
it out myself, sir.
 He spoke at
a symposium in front
of 200 other people.
 No, no.
 Not again.
Not this time.
 Hey, Dad!
 Sir!
 Daddy?
 He wouldn't do
anything stupid,
would he?
 Define ''stupid.''
 Go up to
Crocker himself?
 Trish, come on!
 MAN: Children, no running!
 Jane!
So nice to see you.
You, too.
 How do
you do?
 Mort Crocker,
you're under arrest
 for the murder
of Zoe Sharp and
Mike McMillan.
 Mr. Connors,
I'm so glad
you could make it.
 Why don't you help
yourself to a drink?
 No, no, no, no.
 You might fool
all of these people,
but not me.
 Is everything
all right,
darling?
 Everything's fine.
Please go
back to...
 Captain Connors, sir,
why don't you let us
take you home?
 Pardon us for
the disturbance.
 Oh, crap!
 Hey!
 Connors!
 Oh, come on!
Stop acting
like a child!
 Dad?
 Bless you.
 Thank you.
 Shh!
 He was here.
 Well, of course
he's here. We saw him
come in, Sherlock.
 No, no.
Not Connors.
Mike.
 Mike McMillan
was here.
 What?
 But you sound
all muffled.
 What are you
eating something?
 How can...
 Right, right, right.
 My bad.
My bad.
 He was muffled.
It was my fault.
 There. There,
that's so much better.
 Please get
out of here now.
 I don't allow
anyone inside
my greenhouse.
 Well, that's
not exactly true,
now, is it?
 You let
Mike McMillan
in, didn't you?
 I mean, this is
where you killed him.
 You see, when Mike's spirit
started talking about Crocker,
 I thought he meant
Mr. Crocker,
but it wasn't.
 He was talking about
Mrs. Crocker.
 Well, for your sake,
you had better be
right this time.
 He came
to see you, but
you weren't here.
 What?
 Mike, you know
I don't speak
Italian.
 Shoes. He wants you
to check the shoes
 that he was wearing
that day. The soles.
 You'll find potting soil
in the tread that matches
that stuff.
 Edna,
what's he
talking about?
 Edna?
damn it!
 That's why
I know
the name.
 Before you
were married, your name
was Edna De Soto!
 And you and your brother
John, the park ranger, were
in this together.
 He used the lion
to cover your tracks.
 You're not really going
to believe this old fool,
are you?
 Watch who
you're calling...
What?
 I'm sorry, that was my fault,
I just wasn't paying
attention to you.
 Are you serious?
It's in a
bird feeder?
 No, l'll say it.
 There's a surveillance
camera out front.
 Apparently
it's in a bird feeder.
 If the tape wasn't erased,
 you'll be able to see him
arriving on the day
he was killed.
 Please, Edna,
tell me
you didn't.
 What was l
supposed to do?
 Someone had to protect
everything we've worked
so hard for!
 You would have
given him half
of everything!
 Just like you would
have his mother.
 He was my son!
 Detective,
arrest this woman,
 and while
you're at it,
 issue a warrant
for the arrest
of John De Soto,
 for the murder
of Zoe Sharp and
Mike McMillan.
 Officers,
you heard
the captain.
 Get them
out of here.
 Dad, I'm so
proud of you.
 Showoff.
 Good for you.
 Yeah, thanks.
 It's a real honor,
you know.
 I thought these days
were long gone.
 Does that mean
you're coming out
of retirement?
 What, are you kidding?
 I'm lucky if
I come out
of the fog.
 Well, you gotta keep
your brain stimulated.
 Try the crosswords.
 Nah, I like that
Sudoku.
 Well, we could always
go after cold cases.
 Nah, best leave it
to the young guys, huh?
 Thanks for giving
him this day.
 I hope he remembers
it tomorrow.
 He couldn't
let go and move on,
you know?
 Shawn?
Yeah? What?
 I'm sorry, l...
 A little... Little lump
in my throat.
 Speaking of lumps...
Yes?
 The ostrich?
The tennis ball?
 What?
 You know what?
It's not a big deal,
obviously.
 But it always
bugged me a little.
 Why didn't you
say anything, Trish?
 Like what?
 Oh, I don't know.
 ''I threw the tennis ball
into the highly restricted
ostrich area,
 ''and I let you
take the fall
for it.''
 You're serious.
 It's not too late
to make it right.
 Right is right.
 You really still
have not grown up,
have you?
 Wow.
Goodbye, Shawn.
 Gus.
 (CHUCKLING)
What?
 Hey! There she is!
Hey!
 No, no, here.
 There, are
you happy?
 Yeah, actually,
I am.
 Good.
 Good?
 You really want me to believe
that you put your foot
in your mouth deliberately?
 Please.
 Go get the girl.
 It's your move.
No.
 Listen, would you go...
Shawn, I told you.
 I do not need you
to lay back for me
to get a girl.
 Get over there.
No.
 Show her the abs.
 Show her the abs.
 Not until you challenge me
straight up!
 Fine.
 I will be
kissing Trish
 in 10 minutes.
 Not if I get
there first.
