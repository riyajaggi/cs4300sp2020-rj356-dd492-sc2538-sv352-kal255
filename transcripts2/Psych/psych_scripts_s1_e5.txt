 Psych (2006–2014): Season 1, Episode 5 - 9 Lives - full transcript 
 Shawn senses at once a dubious suicide may be covering up a serial killer, even before Gus is convinced by a series of parallel cases, albeit all with different MO and no common victims profile. Shawn pretends to be a medium inspired by the first victim's cat. He suspects the link is a suicide phone charity, but works out the truth just in time to prevent naive ever-helpful rookie Buzz McNab's wedding preparations turning into tragedy.

 This isn't happening to me!
 What is happening to you,
Shawn?
 Only the worst thing ever!
 A missing captain delicious
magic mood ring!
 Dad, this is a crime.
Can you have them arrested?
 First of all, Shawn, no,
this is not a crime.
 Can't you just haul them in
for questioning?
 Lay into them a little?
And who is "them"?
 You know, the cereal people?
 Oh, the cereal people, huh?
 Well,
i'll tell you what, Shawn,
you can spend a lot of time
 calling 411 to get the number
for your cereal people,
 they're gonna stick you
on hold forever,
 listening to bad music.
 Finally, you're gonna get
some dimwitted secretary,
 who's gonna
take your message,
 and then she's gonna
throw it in a waste bucket.
 Or you can use the skills
I taught you
 and you can outsmart them.
 What am I missing?
 Where is the ring?
Well, it'd be at the bottom.
 Not in this box, you're right.
 The big old bad cereal company
messed up.
 So, you grab another box,
tough luck.
 Where's the ring now?
 At the bottom.
Now I got to eat
the whole box.
 And where's the ring now?
 At the top!
 That's right.
You see, sometimes, Shawn,
you don't have to dig so deep.
 All you gotta do is
turn something upside down
to make it right side up.
 And then...
 you get your prize.
 Thanks, dad!
 Explain to me again
why we couldn't sit
in a restaurant
 and eat
like civilized people.
 Moving is good, Gus,
it helps the digestion.
 Plus, you and i
never do this anymore.
 What? Eat and jog?
 No, talk. Just talk.
 Check in with each other,
as men.
 I wanna know
how you are.
 I wanna know
how Gus is.
 Really? Like you're
really asking me?
 Yes, I'm really asking,
because I care.
 Wow, okay.
 Well, we've been
working cases nonstop
for a month.
 To be honest, I'm burnt.
 I just want to take a nap.
 I couldn't agree
with you more, buddy.
 I think we should
lay low for a bit.
 No more cases.
Oh, I'm so glad
to hear you say that.
 I was kind of worried
about telling you.
 Don't be a silly goose.
 Now, we've had a good talk,
I think we both felt it,
 and look at this.
Here we are.
 What is this, Shawn?
 Okay, here's the thing.
 The police may have
found a body,
 which I may have picked up
on my police scanner,
 which I may have
brought with me.
 No cases, Shawn.
 No cases. We go in, we see.
We say hello. And we leave.
 Say hello?
This is a crime scene.
You can't just walk in there.
 McNab. Nabby!
 Buzz.
 Buzz? Seriously?
 That's his first name.
Don't you ever talk to him?
 Why would I talk
to anybody named buzz?
 Shawn! My man!
 Pow!
 Okay with... yes.
You look trim.
 Somebody made
their wedding weight.
 Five more pounds. I'm close.
But I still have a month.
 You'll get there.
You remember my partner?
 Sure, yeah. Matt, right?
 Gus.
 Right.
 So, what do you got
going on up there?
Don't hold out on me now.
 Looks like suicide.
 A guy from the phone company
found the victim
in his apartment.
 Been up there
for a few days already.
 Few days?
 You mind if we head up,
take a look,
poke around a little?
 Oh, I don't know.
Lassiter's up there
and he's in a mood.
 Yeah, we just, uh,
got his coffee.
 Wanted to bring it by,
make it right.
 Oh, that's nice of you.
 He asked me to get it,
but this is perfect.
 Hey, did you just sip that?
 You don't taste
Lassiter's coffee
before you give it to him?
 That surprises me, buzz.
 He's so particular.
No cream, no sugar...
 it's three creams,
four sugars.
 Yeah, it is.
 Sharp as a tack.
You!
 And fit!
 (PEOPLE CHATTERING)
 We found a note.
 The body's been here
at least three days.
Maybe more.
 All signs point to a 11-44.
 Three 11-44s
in four months?
 There must be something
in the water.
Uh-huh.
 All right, ladies
and gentlemen, listen up.
You know the procedure.
 I want this done right.
I do not want any mistakes.
 Hey, blowie,
 I know you're new,
but next time if you want
 to get your spit
all over the evidence,
 why don't you
just lick it?
 Clearly he doesn't need
any more coffee.
 Okay, there is the dead guy.
Can we go now?
 Relax. We just got here.
Have some mee krob.
 How do you just eat
when there's a dead guy
laying there?
 What, is that rude?
Am I supposed to share?
 Forensics.
 Act natural.
 (GASPS) that's it!
 What? What do you see?
 Red pepper flakes.
 Is that a clue
or something?
 No, it's a delicious spice,
 and it's exactly what
my mee krob needs.
I told you this.
 What are you doing?
This is a crime scene.
You can't touch stuff.
 What?
 Seriously, check this out.
 A marinating steak?
 What, you want
to eat that, too?
 No, but don't you find
that a little odd?
 That a man
would eat a steak?
 No, that a man
who was ready
to kill himself
 would take the time
to marinate a steak
for a future meal?
 Dude,
 this was not suicide.
This was murder.
 The door latch
is still intact.
 Now I ask you.
If you were gonna
kill yourself,
 wouldn't you want
the door to be locked
 so that no one
could barge in on you
right in the middle?
 What? I don't...
what is it? I don't...
 what in the name
of sweet justice
 are you two doing
in my crime scene?
 Your crime scene?
That's funny.
 I didn't see your name
on it anywhere.
 (MOCKS) get out.
We are.
 Just thought you might
wanna know that this thing
here, not a suicide.
 Great.
 Thanks for that. Really.
And thanks also for bringing
a snack to the crime scene.
 Oh, boy. Oh!
 (GASPING)
 I'm sensing a...
 I'm sensing
there was someone here.
 Someone here in the room
with the victim when he died.
 Someone with
a sliver of grease
 on his or her shoe.
 No, I'm not sensing
a struggle. No struggle.
 The door.
 Did you have to break down
the door when you got here?
 No, it was open. Why?
 No, no.
Don't encourage him.
 Get up! McNab,
 I want you to escort
these two men
out of here now!
 Come on, let me
read the witnesses.
You know, due diligence.
 Spencer, we did
the due diligence.
 It was a suicide.
There is no crime.
There are no witnesses.
 You're wrong.
There is a witness.
 There's a cat.
 I wanna talk to that cat.
 As soon as he's finished
licking himself.
 (PURRING)
 Wow, I'm jealous.
 ♪ ♪ I know, you know
that I'm not telling the truth ♪ ♪
 ♪ ♪ I know, you know
they just don't have any proof ♪ ♪
 ♪ ♪ Embrace the deception

 ♪ ♪ Your worst inhibitions

 I can't believe
you took that cat.
 Gus, they were gonna ship him
off to an animal shelter.
 What choice did I have?
 Plus, this cat
is the lead witness
 in a major
murder investigation.
Wanna hold him?
 Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not touching that cat.
 You took the cat,
you carry it.
 We are right on
this thing now.
 I didn't have
anything substantial.
 A steak,
the chain on the door,
a stain on a carpet...
 I wouldn't have believed me.
We needed an in.
Now we have one.
 Plus, he clearly likes you.
Give him a snuggle.
 You know what?
I'm actually gonna enjoy this.
 You having to carry
this cat around,
 pretending you can
communicate with it.
 I'm buying
a disposable camera
 for when you have
to clean out
its dirty litter box.
 Let me tell you something.
This cat here is a gift.
 A conduit for us
to save lives.
 And he has more integrity
in his furry little hand...
 paw.
Paw.
 ...than most people have
in their whole appendages.
 Appendages.
 What?
 All of them.
 Than most people have
in all of their appendages
 combined.
 (MEOWING)
 Oh, yeah? I think he wants
to sleep on your chair.
Isn't it cool?
 How long are you
gonna keep this up for?
 Until we solve the crime.
 Don't you or your cat
get mad at me,
 but I don't think
there was a crime.
 Oh, really?
You don't think so?
 No.
Try telling that to
this poor little guy
 who is traumatized seeing
his owner killed. Tell him.
 (HISSING)
 I'm just saying
 I can kind of get
where Lassister is coming from.
 A few suicides
is not uncommon.
 Gus, did you look
at the sky today?
 Blue, clear.
 And did you feel it
out there? Warm. Nice.
 Statistically,
people in mild climates
 are far less likely
to kill themselves.
 Now, if we were
in Vladivostok,
we could talk.
 Point is,
at the end of the day,
 this was a 50-year-old man
living alone with a cat.
 (MEOWING)
 Do you want down?
You can get down.
 (SIGHS)
 You're probably right.
 I know I'm right.
 It was probably a suicide.
 Thank you.
 That was big of you to admit.
 I'm just... I'm unclear
on one little thing.
 What's that?
 How do we explain
the second body
they just found?
 Dispatcher on radio:
Deceased is in the car, over.
 (POLICE SIREN WAILING)
 Detective O'Hara.
 What, you're here
all by yourself?
 (COPS CHATTERING)
 Ah!
 (COFFEE SPILLING)
 Damn it all.
 Could have happened
to anybody.
 Talk to me.
 Well, victim is a female
in her late 20s,
Gloria Starks.
 We're waiting
for forensics to confirm,
but appears to be a suicide.
 Carbon monoxide poisoning.
Asphyxiation.
 Oh, I'm afraid
the cat doesn't think so.
 Turn around
and walk away.
 This cat can tell us
if the killer has been here.
 All I need is 30 seconds.
 Watch this. You ready boy?
Huh? You ready?
 What? What, over here?
Where? Wait.
 (CAT MEOWING)
 That is...
that is very thoughtful.
I'll tell him.
 He says the fact that
you take three creams
 and four sugars
in your coffee, dangerous.
 Is that true?
 Do you really take
three creams
and four sugars?
 So what?
So what?
 Carly, that is a heart attack
waiting to happen.
 You're still a young man.
 That was amazing.
How did you do that?
It was a lucky guess.
 Don't you get tired
of saying that?
 Now, with your permission,
 I'd like the little boy cat
to sniff out the car.
 Absolutely not.
 (GASPS) oops!
 What did I just say?
 Just relax and
let him do his job.
 He might find something.
 He's peeing.
 No.
 No, he's drawing your
attention to the evidence
in the back seat.
 By peeing on it. Nice.
 Come here, kitty,
kitty, kitty.
 Yes, did you make
good pee-pee?
 Did you make
good pee-pee?
 Yes, you did. What?
 (MEOWING)
 What. That's a...
that's a little inappropriate.
 (LAUGHING)
 I'm sorry, that's rude.
 He was just saying
that he would have
done the same thing,
 if he'd killed himself.
 He would have swung by
the dry cleaners and grabbed
the pantsuit first.
 Maybe she picked up
the dry-cleaning days ago.
 Did the cat
ever think of that?
 What is he doing
right here?
 He is measuring the amount
of carbon monoxide emitted.
 Uh-huh. Okay. I knew that.
 Shawn: Yeah, you did.
 (ENGINE STARTS)
 (HEAVY METAL PLAYING
ON CAR STEREO)
 Whoa!
 Now, does she strike you
as the type that would go
for heavy metal?
 Any number of people
could have changed
her radio station.
 Now, Mr. Spencer, if you
and your new partner
 are finished urinating
on things, I believe
your work here is done.
 Check out the dry-cleaning.
I'm on it.
 Look, I don't care
what Lassister says.
 The cat is not
my new partner, Gus.
Don't be ridiculous.
 Then tell me again
why the cat gets to ride
shotgun?
 He gets carsick,
and you know this.
 Do you want him
to throw up again
back there?
 Is that what you want?
 It's not funny, Shawn.
 Here, lay these down.
 He's doing fine, aren't you?
 This is a company car, Shawn.
 That means I have to return it
in like-new condition.
 Lay these down.
 Whoa, whoa! Look at this!
What?
 "Seventy percent off
of storm doors
and window panes."
 "Everything must go."
Gus, flip it over.
 It's her.
 "Struggling actress
lands big break in
Santa Barbara play."
 And then kills herself?
I don't think so.
 Okay, you might be
onto something.
Yeah.
 The play is called
dazzle and stretch.
 Dazzle and stretch?
 (KNOCKING ON FILING CABINET)
 I was wondering if
I could ask you a question.
 (STAMMERING) I could
really use some advice.
 Yeah, all right.
Get on in here.
 What can I do for you, McNab?
 It's just that, well...
you're still married, right?
 Are you trying
to piss me off?
No, sir, no.
 I just have a question.
 On your wedding night
did you feel any,
 well, any added pressure
to perform?
 Excuse me?
It's just that my Francie
 is going to be expecting
a lot on our first night
as a married couple,
 and I was wondering
if you had any tips for me.
 What the hell kind
of sick bastard are you?
 Thank you very much, sir.
I appreciate it.
 Karen: So, what you are
trying to tell me is
 now it's the cat
that's convinced
these weren't suicides?
 Yes.
 Do you really think
I'm going to open
a bunch of closed cases
 just because
a cat tells me to?
 (MEOWING)
 This is it.
 (CAT MEOWING)
 (Shawn MEOWING)
 Yes, this is it.
 The girl that was
found in her car,
 Gloria Starks, she's here.
 She's here with us.
 (IN GIRL'S VOICE)
Oh, despair!
 I fear that you will leave me.
What choice do I have?
 (SINGING) I dazzle
 and I stretch
 I dazzle
 and I stretch
 what the hell
is going on here?
 (SHUSHING) Mr. Spencer,
this is telling me nothing.
 He can't hear you right now
'cause, see,
he's channeling the cat
 who's channeling Gloria.
 I dazzle
 well, then
what are we looking at?
 Bad acting.
 Gus: I think she wants
you to see
something in the paper.
 Gloria's trying to
tell you something.
 Dazzle and stretch
 "seventy percent off
on storm doors
and window panes.
 "Everything must go."
 "Struggling actress
lands big break in
Santa Barbara play."
 So what.
Gus: So what?
 Does that sound like a woman
who would kill herself?
 Please,
all actresses are crazies.
 I know, I dated one
in college once.
She had a nose ring.
 (GROANS)
 Good work, little buddy.
 Whoa!
I don't know.
 This is something.
Something?
Oh, come on, you guys.
 That's the biggest thing
that ever happened
for that girl.
 Now you need to stop
waiting around
for another suicide
 and start looking
for a serial killer.
 Spencer,
 get off my lap.
 What does this mean?
 I have no idea,
but I've seen it
on numbers all the time
 and it seems
to work for them.
 You ready to give up?
 Four separate suicides,
two of which occurred
before we came on the case,
 and I don't see
a pattern of any kind.
 Different ages,
different sexes.
 Different
socio-economic levels.
 Different methods of death.
 No duplicate weapons,
locations.
 Man, what have we got?
 First we have a jumper,
second, an oven, third, pills,
fourth, carbon monoxide.
 They all have to be
connected somehow.
 And what I see is
whole lot of nothing.
 (SCOFFS) nothing.
 You see, sometimes, Shawn,
you don't have to dig so deep.
 You just need to turn
things upside down
 to make them right side up.
 And there's your prize.
 Wait a minute.
 Gus: What are you doing?
 Turning things upside down
in order to make them
right side up.
 And there's the prize.
 Gus: This is the prize?
 Going to the first
dead guy's place
and what?
 Talk to a dead guy?
 No, we talk to
the dead guy's brother.
 The dead guy's brother
lives at the dead guy's place?
 (BUZZING)
They were roommates.
But that's the point.
 He's getting rid
of the apartment.
 (BUZZING)
 And we're here to rent it.
 We're what?
 Why can't we for once
just talk to somebody as us?
 Because, Gus, I don't
want him to be on guard.
 If he thinks we're
investigating something,
he'll clam up.
 Wes Hiltonbock?
Yeah?
 Hey, Shawn Spencer.
I talked to you on the phone
about the apartment,
 and this is Gus.
It would actually
be for both of us.
 Yeah, okay, come on.
 Thanks, man.
 Just so you guys know,
the utilities are included,
 but I would require
first and last month and
a sizable security deposit.
 Oh, that's not a problem.
You take cats?
 Yeah, I guess so.
 You two guys have a cat?
 We do, actually.
He's sort of like our child.
 I see. How do you guys
know each other?
 We're partners.
 Got you.
 Oh, no, no, no.
No, it's fine.
Really, I'm totally fine.
 No, we're partners
in a private...
relationship.
 Believe it,
it's been a while.
 We finish
each other's sentences.
 So, tell me, Wes,
 why would you want
to give up such
a handsome apartment?
 Do you...
do you not like it anymore?
 Ooh, Gus,
 good news, shower for two.
 Actually I just have
some bad memories here.
I used to...
 I used to live here
with my brother,
but he passed away.
 Oh, I'm sorry, man.
Was he sick, or...
 he killed himself.
Oh, good lord.
 I'm so sorry.
 Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.
 We were real close,
you know.
 God, was he depressed?
I mean, were there signs?
Did you...
 what am i... I'm sorry,
you don't have
to answer those questions.
 No.
 Actually, I had no idea
anything was wrong, you know.
 I mean,
he had so much to live for.
 He was a great guy,
you know.
 Smarter than me,
more talented.
 He was a great singer.
 He was really going places.
 So look, are you guys...
you guys interested
in the place or...
 what do you think, honey?
 I think it's great.
I think it's perfect.
 All right, then.
Well, I got another couple
coming by a little later so...
 but i'll let you guys know
either way.
 Shower for two?
 That was so I could see
your face when I said it.
 You know,
you enjoy these things
more than you should.
 I suffered through
that for no reason.
We learned nothing.
 Yes, but I grabbed this
while we were up there.
 You took his mail?
 It's not like I took his
sports illustrated.
Dude, it's a phone bill.
 You can't open
someone else's mail, Shawn.
It's a federal offense.
 Gus, he's dead.
So what?
 Well, maybe i'll
hold it to my head
and read it psychically.
 Hurry up, Shawn.
Gus, who's gonna see us?
 Hurry up.
 Wait, there's like...
 there's like 16 calls here
to some 1-800 stress line.
 Including the last call
he made.
 I've seen the ads for that.
So what?
 A depressed guy
calls a stress line.
 And I bet you a hungry guy
calls a pizza place.
 That doesn't
tell us anything.
 Yeah, but it might
give us a link.
 I'm gonna run
the other victims'
phone records.
 With what?
Your do-it-yourself
phone record running kit?
 The next best thing.
 The answer is in
the phone bills.
 I need you to run
the victims' phone records.
 What, no cat this time?
 Julie, I'm very serious
about this.
 I have a strong sense
about a stress line
 and I know the link
is in the phone records.
 I don't know why
you would think I would do
something like this for you.
 Some have said it's the hair.
 Really? Who says that?
 Oh, guess what?
We already ran
the phone records
 and checked out
the dry-cleaning.
 Turns out
the pantsuits were picked up
over a week ago.
 What kind of
dog and pony show
do you think we run here?
 Gus, you wanna
take this one?
No.
 Let me put an end
to this non-case
right now, okay?
 Yes, all the victims
called the 1-800 stress line.
 Not just once,
many times over.
 Detective Lassister and i
have combed everything.
 We've gone to
the bone on these.
All the way to the bone?
 I know this is hard
for you to grasp,
 but these people did have
something in common.
They were troubled
 and they were depressed,
 and as sad as that is,
they all committed suicide.
Case closed.
 We've clearly
wasted your time.
 It's not over, is it?
Of course not.
 They all called the same
help line and they all
killed themselves? Come on!
 Shawn, that's what
stressed people do.
 Strange how
he gave up so easily.
 Yeah, it is.
 Maybe we should take
a closer look
at that stress line.
 Gloria Starks
only called that line
 'cause she was stressed
about an audition.
 You call a help line
and they find you dead?
That's not very helpful.
 What if someone there
is killing the callers and
making it look like suicide?
 Gus, we go to the stress line,
I think we solve the case.
 Come on.
 Ta-da!
 What is this?
 You're looking at
our new business.
Mazel-tov.
 Are you out of your mind?
You rented office space
for this?
 Gus,
don't be a crazy hooligan.
I rented a sign.
 Now, let's go say hello
to our new neighbors.
 Hello, everyone!
 Who wants pineapple?
Be honest.
 Ah, you guys
can slice it up,
fight over it later.
 I'm sorry, gentlemen,
may I help you?
 I'm terrance,
I run the line here.
 Terrance, hello.
 I'm Shawn Spencer,
this is my partner Gus
"silly pants" Jackson.
 Just came by
to say hello.
 We've opened up
our own little 1-800 thingy
down the hall.
 Not as big as you guys.
More of a closet, really.
 Your own 1-800 thingy, huh?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's called dial-a-psychic.
 Maybe you recognize us.
 I am the lead psychic
for the Santa Barbara
police department.
 McCallum murders.
 Edmond robberies?
 Over there, you?
Nothing? Nothing?
Wow, really.
 What, do you guys
live in this room?
 (ALL LAUGHING)
 So, you can
know stuff about me
just by looking at me?
 Yeah, pretty much.
 Do it.
Do it?
 Go ahead, show us.
 Looking for a little demo.
 Well, for one,
they don't like pineapple.
 (ALL LAUGHING)
 I don't know guys. I don't
think big t wants us
to take up any more...
 oh, no, no, no.
Go right ahead.
 Half the lines are down,
phones are being worked on
right now.
 We have time
for your little trick.
Oh, yeah?
 Let's see what i
can come up with.
 Loose flowing stanzas,
bobby frost.
 Are you a poet, by chance?
 Yeah! Yeah, I am!
 (ALL GASPING)
 Wow. How did you know that?
 I guess you could say
I'm a bit of a psychic poet.
 Oh, please, stop.
 'Cause I'm like,
I'm freaking out here!
 Do you see his eyeliner?
 Guy could be the drummer
from the cure.
 Wow, I can see why
you come out here to eat.
It's beautiful.
 Sound of the seagulls,
the smell of the ocean,
the salt air...
 hmm. I never noticed.
 What do you got there?
 What you asked for.
 I ran the sheets
on all the volunteers
at the stress line.
 Do you mind?
It's police business.
 Scram.
 Let's see what we got here.
 Well, lookie there.
 It's a picture
of an old friend.
 Hmm.
 Hey, Rory.
 Where the hell
have you been?
 I've been sitting
on this mop bucket
 in this tiny closet
for the last hour and a half
waiting for you to show up.
 I'm all cramped.
Well, get up, man.
 Do some pushups or something.
I need you light and limber.
 Do some pushups?
Sure, like Clint Eastwood
in escape from Alcatraz.
 Sure, he spends
the whole movie
in a tiny little cell, right?
 But he's in the best shape
of his entire life.
 Give me a little
piece of tape.
 What happened to
the big ticking time clock?
 Gus, what do you think
I've been doing all day?
 My work happens here and here.
 What are you doing?
 I am trying to
create a pleasant
work environment.
 I can tell by looking
at your little area
that you don't care.
 We don't work here, Shawn.
 We do until
we solve these murders.
 But don't worry,
I have a plan.
 You are gonna call
the stress line
and pretend to be depressed.
 No, I'm not.
Yes.
 And I will go down the hall
when you make the call,
 ask for Rory, so that
I can see him in action.
 Why don't you call him?
 Gus, please be serious
for one second.
 No one's gonna believe
that I'm depressed.
Come on.
 I got an idea.
Why don't you have
the cat make the call?
 He's like your new partner,
right? Where is he, anyway?
 Gus, he's far more comfortable
in your car.
 Plus, I need him
well rested for when
he identifies the killer.
 Now, wait exactly two seconds
and then make the call.
 Oh! I have no idea
what I'd even say.
 (SIGHS)
 Here's a good opener.
"Hello, my name's Gus.
 "I have a deep-seated jealousy
for a tiny little boy cat."
 Why would you put them
on speakerphone?
 See, because I think
that tends to undercut...
 big t! Look sharp!
 What is it now, Mr. Spencer?
 Just wanted to
pick your brain
for a second.
 How many lines
you got going here?
 I have 12 lines,
but I'm adding more
all the time.
 I get it, I get it,
the more lines,
the more green, am I right?
 I'm a non-profit operation.
The calls are free.
 I'm not in this for the money.
 Really, that's weird.
 See,
I'm thinking of charging
four bucks a minute.
 (SOFTLY) Rory.
 Rory!
 Hey, Ror.
 Hey.
You really do love
your music, huh?
 You kidding?
Music inspires me.
 Yeah, you know,
you don't really strike me
as the...
 charitable type?
I was gonna say sensitive,
but sure.
 Actually, I'm here as
part of a community service
 on this assault beef,
you know.
 I got into it with this guy
who didn't like my poetry.
 So, 250 hours.
 (PHONE RINGING)
Two-fifty, wow,
that's intense.
 (GRUNTS)
 Rory, that's line 6!
 I'll let you
get back to work.
Sorry.
 Hello, stress-line,
 the extra s is for
extra stress. This is Rory.
 Uh-huh.
 Right, so you're experiencing
some stress.
 Career and personal?
 Well, yeah, I suppose.
 I mean my career's not exactly
where I would like it to be.
 No. No, I don't have
a girlfriend right now.
 It's been awhile.
 Right.
 Right, that's not good.
 Does it make you
have dark thoughts?
 Like how dark are you talking?
 Like, "wanna be dead" dark?
 Okay, easy,
I just wanna say this,
 like, right off the bat,
suicide is not the answer.
 Who said anything
about suicide?
 I just said maybe i
should find a new hobby,
like coin collecting.
 Or something
at the beach.
 I like water activities.
 Like drowning?
 What? Drowning?
 I don't want to drown!
 No, no, of course you don't.
 That's awful, okay?
 But I don't care
what you say about
 suicide in a lake
being poetic,
 you know, like,
your body floating to the top
 of the pristine, serene waters
 and your final breaths
rippling out in
 an ever-widening circle,
you know,
like the circle of life.
 But you have to stop
that kind of thinking.
 You have so much to live for.
 You're damn straight,
I have a lot to live for!
 Of course you do.
 You see, I can tell,
this phone call is
helping you already.
 (MOUTHING)
 Dude, what the hell was that?
 Was he trying to help me?
Cause I feel
really creeped out right now.
 Dude, he put you
on the creepy train
 headed for creep island
where the natives
drink creep nectar
 out of creepy
coconut shells...
Shawn, it's horrible.
 Yeah, I'm sorry.
He's nuts, Shawn.
 Yes.
And worst of all,
 he actually made
some good points!
 I mean, pharmaceutical
sales, not sexy.
 You are my only
non-work friend.
 There's got to be
something wrong with that.
 Hey, hey, hey,
what is this?
 What?
 Hang in there.
 He's right,
I need to start taking
some more risks.
 Does that mean
we can go cliff diving
in Zihuatanejo?
 No. I'm being serious, Shawn!
 Look, would it make
you feel any better if i
told you Hiltonbock called?
 We got the apartment!
What would make me
feel better
 is if we called the police!
This guy is dangerous, Shawn.
 Let's call Vick.
Maybe get him arrested.
 Gus, Gus!
What?
 The only thing
this guy is guilty of right
now is being a bad poet.
 You know how this game works.
 We cannot just pick up
a phone and beg the police
to come and save us.
 (MUTTERING ANGRILY)
 Look, just...
 just stay away
from the water for now.
 Final decision, we wait.
 (ELEVATOR BELL DINGING)
 (WOMAN TALKING)
 No, it's this way.
 You sure?
Yes.
 Now, was that so hard?
 Maybe you'd care
to explain this.
 My eyeliner pencil?
 So, you admit it's yours.
 Funny how Gloria Starks'
suicide note
 was scrawled across her
windshield in black eyeliner.
 Yet no eyeliner was found
at the crime scene.
 You, my friend,
are looking at exhibit a.
 Bag it, O'Hara.
 You like your music,
don't you, Rory?
 Yeah, I do.
It's my inspiration.
 I bet.
 I bet it inspires you to kill.
 That's why you
couldn't resist
 playing your big-haired,
drug-induced death music
on Mortimer Tilden's stereo
 while you forced him
to swallow all those pills.
 Or on Gloria Starks'
car radio
 while she slipped into
unconsciousness.
 And even now.
 Let's have a little listen,
shall we?
 (UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING)
 What, you think
you can pull
a fast one on me
 switching out your
head-thrashing crap
for this noise?
 This crap is
all I listen to.
 I hate metal music.
 I use the details
that I get from callers
 to write better poems.
 I am not a killer!
 Yeah, I know,
you're a poet,
 but you're also an assaulter,
aren't you?
 Who do you think arrested you
on that assault charge?
 Oh, a guy from
the phone company
found the victim.
 I didn't kill anybody.
 Get him out of my sight.
 (ALL MURMURING)
 What?
You're not taking notes?
 How could you
let him do that?
 Now Lassister gets credit
for solving the crime
and we won't get paid.
 Oh, we're gonna get paid.
How do you figure?
 Lassister didn't
solve the crime.
 Rory is innocent.
He didn't do it.
 He didn't?
No.
 Then who did?
 (MEOWING)
 Just grip the spike
with your little foot
and climb! Come on!
 (Gus GRUNTING)
 Why do I gotta go first?
 'Cause you're
a climbing machine, Gus.
Just, you know, be careful.
 Grip the spike
with your foot!
Okay, oh, okay, okay.
 Grease.
 Dude, dude! Dude,
I know who the killer is!
 Can I come down then?
No, no, stay up there.
 I have to figure out
where he's headed.
Who is it?
 Well, put it this way,
 I don't think
taking the apartment
is such a good idea,
 unless you think
it's cool that our
would-be landlord
 is a serial killer.
Hiltonbock?
 There was a pattern.
 See, all the murders
coincide with dates
 that Hiltonbock
was servicing
the phone lines.
 That's when he had access.
With this?
 Yes. Yeah, yeah,
send that down.
 Perfect!
 See, this device stores
all the incoming
and outgoing calls.
 My guess is that
wherever number
he dialed last,
 that's where
Hiltonbock is headed.
 And whoever that is,
is probably his next victim.
 (PHONE RINGS)
 Buzz on answering machine:
Hello, you've reached
buzz McNab.
 I'm not in right now,
but please
do leave a message
 and I will get back to you
when I get in.
 Oh, no.
 Who are you calling?
 (PHONE RINGING)
 Hello, chief?
Hey, Shawn Spencer here.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look,
I'm getting a vibe right now
as big as a buick!
 Whoa, whoa, whoa,
no, you don't.
 Stay, boy cat!
 Hey, McNab,
so this is the place, huh?
 It's nice. It's really nice.
 Drop it!
Don't come any closer.
 Put it down
or I will drop you!
 I swear to god
I'm gonna shoot him.
 Drop it!
Everybody breathe,
just breathe!
 Get out of here.
 Well, the other ones
must have gone a lot
smoother than this,
 huh, Hiltonbock?
 Though, comparatively,
it was probably pretty easy
 to get Mortimer Tilden
to swallow those pills.
 You wanna die, old man, huh?
Eat them!
 Because you are not really
a cold-blooded serial killer.
 Are you?
No, but he threw his
own brother off a building!
 I didn't push him
off the roof.
 No, no, no. No, you didn't.
You didn't do that.
 Shawn: But you were there.
You saw it.
 You saw the whole thing.
You saw him
jump off the balcony
 of the apartment
that you shared.
He was weak.
 There's a lot of weak people
out there, Hiltonbock.
 Are you gonna
track them all down,
huh, one at a time?
 Punish them
for their weakness?
 You wanna get back
at your brother so badly,
 you don't even care
who these people were,
 just that
they called the line.
 And look, you're gonna kill
McNab here just because
 he had a few
pre-wedding jitters.
 (STAMMERS)
I was just looking
for a little advice.
 Nobody else would talk to me.
 Shawn: It's okay, buzz.
We all have stress.
 All of us.
Right here in this room.
 I mean,
take a good look, Hiltonbock.
We all have problems.
 Who else deserves
to get shot or hung?
 Maybe it's Gus.
 That's enough, Spencer.
No. Shoot him.
 What are you doing?
 Yeah, maybe I should.
 Don't listen to him.
 He's a crazy person,
he's crazy.
 That's right, I am crazy.
 So maybe
you should shoot me.
 Okay.
 Here's the best part.
It doesn't matter
what I think,
 because you have a problem
that's a lot bigger than me.
 This guy.
 The man with his gun
trained on you is not only
a fine human being,
 with a strong Irish hairline,
 he is an exemplary
public servant
 and arguably the finest
detective mind
 in the lower Western
Santa Barbara county area
 over the age of 35.
 And right now,
while I'm speaking,
 he is devising a swift
and stealth-like tactic
 that is going to disarm you
 and blow your freaking mind!
 Anytime you're ready.
 Shawn: All right,
we gotta make the move.
 (MEOWING)
 (SCREAMING)
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
 That was adequate, Spencer.
 Don't thank me.
 Thank the little boy cat.
 (GROANING)
 There you are.
 There's my big guy.
 There's my big guy.
You are a hero.
 You are a hero today. Yes.
 Speaking of heroes, McNab,
I was gonna get you
 something off
the registry online,
 but it turns out
the chief already got you
the asparagus steamer.
 So, instead I give you
this little guy.
 (MEOWING)
 Yeah.
 If you take him in the car,
he likes to ride upfront,
shotgun.
 You know, there's
something beautiful
 about the color
fruity puffs turns the milk.
 I think it's
the most beautiful thing
in the whole world.
 You know, I've been thinking.
 You're not
the only one who lives
a charmed life, Shawn.
 I got it pretty good, too.
 Yes, you do,
and it makes me glad
to hear you say so.
 I mean,
the other day at work,
 this dermatologist,
Katie Finestatt,
 commented how i
looked handsome
 carrying my sample case
into her office.
 Finestatt said that?
Yes, she did.
 And she is fine.
 So, it got me thinking,
 maybe pharmaceutical sales
can be sort of sexy.
 There are times
when I have to stand
a few feet away
 because you're
literally sizzling.
 You see what I'm saying?
I mean,
 you may be my only
non-work friend,
but you're my best friend.
 And how many best friends
does one guy need, really?
 That's my point.
 It's all in
the attitude, Gus.
Exactly.
 Not sweating the small stuff.
 Life is too short.
 Too short.
 Changing my attitude, Shawn.
 Where the hell is my prize?
 Where's my ring, Shawn?
Easy now.
 No, no, I've timed
the bowls out perfectly,
Shawn.
 Me, then you,
then me, then you,
then I get the prize!
 What happened to
"not sweating
the small stuff?
 "Life's too short,"
all that?
 Did you open
the bottom of the box?
 Now, why would I do
something like that?
 That's my ring.
 You know I would kill
for that ring, don't you?
 Oh, you're upsetting me.
 You just changed
my mood from an orangey
yellow to a muddy brown.
 You need to say
something sweet. Quick.
 Gus!
 That's so childish.
 I'm gonna eat yours!
