 Psych (2006–2014): Season 1, Episode 3 - Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Piece - full transcript 
 Attorney general Maxwell demands a discrete investigation into the theft from a hotel safe of his family's heirloom ring just before his son Dylan's wedding with possible gold-digger Bethany Cadman. Shawn can't resist volunteering his services, accepted by the couple, not Carlton Lassiter, yet his suite is invaded as base for an inquest Gus is suckered into because of the state-of-the-art safe. Shawn discovers a missing hotel executive's bloodily murdered corps and brilliantly works trough wedding party suspects while joining bachelor - and hen parties.

 Hey, Shawn, what in the world
do you think you're doing?
 Hide and seek.
I don't think so.
 But you said we could.
Not like that.
 That's how you play.
 Not in my house.
Shawn, you can't tail
a suspect like that.
 Look how loud you are.
Your perp is gonna hear
you coming from every turn.
 Those things smack
every time you take a step.
 Now, if you're gonna
wear them when you compete,
you gotta keep...
 compete?
 (WHISPERING)
On the balls of your feet.
Balls of your feet.
 And you take deliberate steps.
 You don't know where he is.
 He shouldn't get to know
where you are.
 He's invisible,
you're invisible.
 Now, you've leveled
the playing field.
Can I go now?
 No. You're going to learn
to do the little things right.
 For instance,
 when you peer
around a corner,
 I want you to stay
down low 'cause, you see,
 they're expecting you
up here at eye level.
 When you walk down a hall,
 check the grains
of the carpet.
We just vacuumed, right?
 And never, ever again
do I ever want to
hear you slam a door
 when you can
pull it closed.
But we're just playing.
 Well, play right, Shawn,
or don't play at all.
 Shawn,
 (WHISPERING) he's not in here.
 Carlton: I don't need to
tell you how vital it is
 that we maintain
the utmost secrecy
on this heist.
 The attorney general
does not want his son's
wedding disrupted
 any more than
it's already been.
 How will we explain
our presence to the press?
 We don't.
Just let them stew.
 Well, that's one approach.
 But, if I may suggest, I once
wrote a paper regarding press
releases and such and...
 sorry, your idea sounds great.
 (DOOR OPENS)
 Get the board.
 What are you doing?
Dude, I'm onto something big.
 Tailing cops?
In a police station?
 Some monumentally expensive
ring just got stolen.
 I'm gonna get
us on the case.
 We just got a case
five minutes ago.
 Yeah, a lame one.
Stolen computers
from a high school.
 Come on, like,
you were falling asleep
during that meeting.
 This is an heirloom.
It's worth $5 million,
 lifted from the hotel where
they're having the wedding.
Wedding's on Saturday.
 (EXCLAIMS)
There's an open bar.
 Dude, we're so there.
Are we looking
at the same thing?
 I told you to wait
in my office.
I had a premonition.
 Something sparkly.
Just over five karats,
 perfect clarity,
slight inclusion.
 Is this ringing
any bells for you?
 Solve the case I gave you.
Then we'll talk.
 In the meantime,
I have a lot of work
to complete.
 It's the secretary.
 Pardon?
The secretary.
The secretary did it.
 Now, what can you
tell me about the ring
I'm envisioning?
 But you barely even
looked at this folder.
 It's in the papers.
Where?
 The signatures,
it's in her handwriting.
 Look, she's faking her
own signature, and later
there's evidence that it's...
 I feel it in the ink.
 Very bad vibes.
 Strong squidish vibes.
 We'll check it out.
Until then, I trust you
can find the door.
 But what about the ring?
Not until this one is done.
 Hey, let me gather some
information, all right?
Make a little headway.
 Then i'll have a psychic
episode that blows the
ears right off their skulls.
 Shawn, I'm in
meetings all day.
 I barely had time to come
down for this. We're doing
what the chief says. Period.
 Shawn: So sorry to have
kept you waiting.
 I am Shawn Spencer,
chief psychic here
at the department.
 Thank you so much for helping.
This whole thing
has been devastating.
 My hands are still shaking.
 You're doing fine.
Okay, I only have a second.
 I'll need you to tell me
everything I have to
know about this case
 as quickly as humanly
possible, okay?
 What about this guy?
What's going on
with the best man?
 I don't know,
he's not answering
his phone or his door.
 Dylan: This day
has just been
completely unreal.
 Guys, it's going to be fine.
 You're in good hands.
I have never failed a case.
 I know who you are.
I read about you in the paper.
 You did?
 You're the sister
of the groom.
 And the maid of honor.
 And the wedding planner?
Correct.
 That is so many hats.
You should see my closet.
 I am hoping to.
 But not until
I find this ring.
 Well, the wedding's tomorrow.
How fast are you?
 That depends entirely on
how much cooperation
I receive.
 Why don't you come
to the wedding?
 Yeah. No, no,
I couldn't possibly
impose on you. No.
 Please, you're
saving us here.
 You find this ring,
we'd owe you everything.
 What in the hell
is going on here?
 I just dropped by
to say hello.
 Guys, this is head detective
carlton Lassister and his
lovely new partner, Juliet.
 His last one turned out
to be his girlfriend,
so she was transferred.
 I'm not sure if that was
the only reason. I'll let you
decide for yourselves.
 Shall we?
Sure.
 If this is some sort of hazing
ritual, where we're gonna end
up naked in a river somewhere,
 i'll need to arrange
for a ride home.
 Listen to me, Spencer.
 The department's
reputation is on the
line with this one.
 If I catch you anywhere near
this case, I will throw every
book I can find at you.
 What if you find the bible?
You going to throw that, too?
 Seems a little sacrilegious
to me, don't you think?
 Ow.

 Burton guster, central coast
pharmaceuticals.
 Shawn:
Dude, I got a suspect...
 i'll call you back
later, Shawn.
 No, no, you can't.
I left my cell phone
in your car yesterday,
 along with a tuna sandwich.
 I seriously hope
you found that.
 Later this afternoon, Shawn.
 No, no, Gus, this happens now.
The wedding is tomorrow.
 Is he coming?
 Not yet.
But we're getting closer.
 Thanks, stabber.
 Mandatory briefing.
Magnolia room.
15 minutes.
 Excuse us, please.
Attorney general maxwell.
 Detective, I trust
we're making progress.
 Carlton: I am right on
schedule, sir.
 I've booked myself a suite
to use as a command center.
 Maxwell: Why?
 I'll stay the night
if I have to.
Keep an eye on things.
 The city's not paying
for that, is it?
 No?
 That ring has been
in my family
for 200 years.
 My mother agonized over
the decision to give
it to my son.
 I'm not letting it
get away now.
 Sir, we are checking
every person who came
through that door.
 Every employee.
Every guest.
 Nobody checks
out of this hotel
 until we're just short
of going through every
piece of their luggage.
 Way ahead of you, sir.
No, you're not.
 What?
 Can I help you, sir?
 I'm just
 listening.
 For what?
For what?
 Lyme disease.
Lyme disease?
 Lyme disease, rickets,
avitaminosis, legionnaire's,
bubonic. You name it.
 I want you to
listen to something.
 Do you hear that?
Mmm-hmm.
 We have spores in the wall.
 Spores?
You know
where else they are?
 In the planter. You know
where else? Everywhere
in the entire hotel.
 Who called you? Mike?
 Mike? Is this
a big joke to you?
 I don't answer to mike.
Have you seen mike lately?
Mike can kiss my ass.
 I was called in by
the state inspector himself.
 Are you at all aware
how dangerous this is?
Hell, yes, I am!
 Good. I'm glad.
 I need access to
this whole place,
elevator shafts, air vents,
 the safe room, obviously.
 The safe room
is a crime scene.
 This eucalyptus
will be dead by lunch.
 The safe room will be
a triage unit if I don't get
those spores out of there.
 Understood.
Can we let the cops finish
up in there first?
 Tell them to hurry.
 Oh, man.
 (SNIFFS)
 Thirteen minutes after
midnight, members
of the wedding party
 enter the safe room,
placing the ring
into a safety deposit box,
 which was slid into the safe
and closed for the night.
 No sensors indicate
that either the safe door
 or the lock box
was opened again
until the following morning.
 Please note, he has activated
the time lock, which prevents
the safe from opening.
 No one walks into
that room again
until the following morning,
 when the ring is
discovered missing.
 So it definitely didn't
disappear during the night?
 Or so they would
like you to think.
 However, if you look
closely, there are nine
glitches on this tape.
 I'm sorry, glitches?
 Seams, static bursts
in the image.
 Someone could have tapped in
an alternate video feed of
this room while it was empty.
 Or, more likely,
as I believe,
 someone built a scale
replica of this room.
 (MAN LAUGHS)
 Who laughed?
 Nobody?
 (MAN LAUGHS)
 If somebody disagrees
with my theory,
I'd like to know.
 It does seem
very elaborate.
 And just a bit far-fetched.
 Are you a detective?
Why are you here?
 Buzz: You asked for
all of us to come.
 Oh, well, officer,
since you're such
an expert on fetching,
 why don't you fetch
me a cup of coffee?
 (LAUGHS)
 Moving on.
 All the employee alibis
check out. Except this one.
 Dietrich mannheim.
 Currently
the facilities manager.
 You may remember him
from the security video.
 He was in the room
when the ring was placed
into the safety deposit box.
 During questioning,
he was nervous, evasive,
 and contradicted himself
more than once.
 His work computer history
reveals that he recently
visited websites
 for boats and expensive
cars, and he failed to
show up for work.
 Questions?
 Is this your only lead?
 His responses
to my interrogation
were hostile at best.
 Clarify "hostile".
 Use my tone now as a guide.
 Detective O'Hara,
all alone?
 Well, not anymore, apparently.
 Work troubles?
 I'm sensing work troubles.
 Here, let me read your palm.
 How about just one finger?
 Come, now, let me see
if I can be helpful.
 Why are you here?
 The maxwell wedding.
 Honestly. I was invited.
 By whom?
 Beth. Bethany. The bride.
 Little baby b.
The b sting. Love her.
 God, dylan is so
lucky to have her.
 She grounds him in ways
that he needed grounding,
don't you think?
 She's a good sport.
 Air supply, really?
 Kidding. Just kidding.
Relax.
 This is work-related.
 You thought this place
would be different,
 but nobody respects
your opinions.
 They all think
you're too young?
 Always.
 Always.
 You know, I think
you and I could
help each other.
 And how would that be?
 Oh, I know things.
Things about rings.
 Oh. I thought you were
here for a wedding.
 I am... ish.
 You first.
 (STAMMERING)
I just got a message for you,
mr. Guster, and,
 well, I'm afraid
it's about your cat.
 My cat?
 The poor thing is in
the animal hospital.
They think her leg is broken.
 I'll get down there later.
 You're not going?
 I'm very busy.
 But your cat needs you for
moral support. The vet said
it could be the difference.
 Later.
 You have to go.
 Mr. Guster, I know
that you're in shock.
 Don't do anything you're
going to regret forever.
 I don't even...
he's not going?
 Oh.
 So, now I have a cat?
 An orange tabby. Last
Christmas, you made her a tiny
Santa hat. It was adorable.
 Fantastic.
I can't even have a
make-believe boy cat.
 Gus, a boy cat wouldn't
serve my purposes
nearly as well.
 The next time I need you,
pickles is having kittens.
 Pickles?
Mrs.. Pickles is her full name.
 Though, I'm not
actually sure cats can
marry outside of Boston.
 Yeah, well,
in a related issue,
 I'm blocking your number
on all the phones
in the office.
 If you think that will work,
I think it's endearing.
 In the meantime, aren't you
the least bit curious
 about who was there
when they put the ring
in the hotel safe?
 Wait a minute.
 This is a safecracking case?
 Did I forget to mention that?
 What kind of safe?
 The hydra 700.
 The 700 is out?
 That's impossible,
nobody could crack that.
 I haven't even told you about
the wall sensors.
 Can we be done by 3:00?
 Yes.
 The safe room,
right behind that door.
 What is all this?
I thought this was
a safe job.
 Oh, Lassister
has this insane idea that this
in an elaborate heist, right?
 Like on par
with Ocean's Eleven,
or Thomas Crown,
 or... oh, the one
where they kill
Donald Sutherland
 in the first ten minutes,
remake...
 mr. Spencer, mr. Guster,
what a surprise.
 Chief. Looking good.
You're probably
wondering...
 I sent an officer down to the
high school to take a look
at your secretary suspect.
 She cracked.
He didn't even get
the first question out.
 Really?
 'Cause I envisioned
that being harder.
 Yet I don't recall
asking you to come down
here to the de la cruz.
 Well, we have
reason to believe
 this case goes in
a completely
different direction.
 Huh.
 Let me be perfectly clear.
 I didn't see you
and we didn't talk.
 Call me if you have something.
 I love her.
Yeah.
 He knows you?
 I had to lay some groundwork.
He doesn't believe in
psychics. This is plan b.
 Chief inspector Shawn,
how are you?
 (SHUSHING) I'm undercover.
 Not even the
American police know
I'm in on this.
 (STAMMERING) I'm sorry.
I blew it again, didn't i?
 And after you brought
me into your confidence.
 Bobby, it's fine.
Believe me.
 These other Interpol guys
are very appreciative
of what you're doing here.
 (RULE BRITANNIA PLAYING)
How long will you need?
 Just as discussed,
five minutes, tops.
 You're my man.
 Interpol?
 That's right.
Missing ring division.
 I believe I was recruited
out of North Africa
when I was 15.
 You could at least
use a British accent.
 (IN BRITISH ACCENT) oh,
please, Gus, I started with
a British accent,
 and then seamlessly
slipped into my
fake American one.
 Bobby gave me
some pointers.
 Apparently you Americans
say "howdy" a lot.
 Howdy.
 What are you doing?
 List. List. I made a list of
suspects after attending
Lassiter's briefing.
 He let you in his briefing?
 (LAUGHS) he does when
you're in the airshaft.
 All your suspects
are in the
wedding party?
 Look, the only ones who
knew they put
that ring in the safe
 were at the rehearsal dinner.
 So, it was an inside job?
Looking like it.
 Gus: You're making keys?
 Gus, how else
do you expect me
to get in the rooms?
 Shawn, you can't do that.
 Of course I can,
I worked at the
Hampton inn
 for that three-day weekend
in Austin when we were 19.
 I know you remember that.
Gus, this is so easy.
 Try making a key.
 Dude, I rule.
 Nope. Innocent.
Let's move.
 What are you talking about?
We haven't even
stepped foot in there.
 Gus, do you need
the remedial course, really?
 Uncle Leo left
his wallet on the table.
 Criminals are sneaky,
jaded, suspicious people.
 They're smart
and defensive.
 This guy has a reason
to be trusting.
 Can we go now?
 (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)
 Shawn?
 Guys, hey,
your door was open.
 Oh, it was?
 Yes, and I was worried that
something horrible
had happened. You're okay?
 Yeah, yeah.
 (LAUGHS)
 I told you we didn't have to
come in here. They're fine.
 Everybody's fine.
This is my associate, Gus.
 Just call him peter panic.
 How are you doing?
 So, you're a psychic, too?
 Well...
Gus here is
a safe expert.
 Yes, he subscribes to
the safecracker,
 a safecracking comic book.
 It's an online magazine.
And it's a trade publication.
 Excuse me for saying so,
but how exactly do you figure
into this legal family?
 I started my
criminal law degree.
 Then I came to my senses,
went to Europe, painted,
slept, ate, sank a boat.
 (GASPS)
 Disappointed?
Besotted.
 We'd like to speak
to the best man,
if possible.
 So would we.
 Any ideas where he is?
 We haven't seen him
since the night of
the sixth.
 Which is the night
the ring disappeared.
 The florist quit.
 So, after we dropped
the ring off at the safe,
 we had to wrap bouquets
all night in our suite.
 Everybody except jack.
Do you think he's a suspect?
 No, we just
think he's lazy.
 Dylan: Hey, dad,
this is Shawn Spencer.
 He's the psychic
I told you about.
 I know. Let's talk.
 Son, I'm very comfortable with
the current direction
of the investigation.
 So, let's let the real
police department
do their job.
 Sir, believe me,
I am only here to help.
 In fact, I was actually
hoping to discuss...
 I'm glad you understand.
 The guy shook my hand like
I stole something.
 You see?
That's why I can't
do this job alone.
 (LOCK CLICKING)
 Wow. That is about
as orange as you can get.
 Which suspect's
room is this?
Lassiter's.
 The head detective?
He has his own room?
 Perhaps paid
for by the city.
 No. No. This is
going too far.
We're not staying.
 Gus, we need these
witness statements.
 It's not exactly like
we're being overwhelmed
with cooperation here.
 Oh, Lacey.
 Lacey, you can
sink my boat.
 Toss me the remote.
 (EXCLAIMS)
 Man on tv: It's the bottom
of the eighth inning
and so far it's been...
 what do you got?
You got anything good?
 I hate to say it,
but yeah.
 The attorney general
has an insurance policy
on the ring.
 He'll collect a cool
$3 million on it as long
as it still belongs to him,
 which it does only until
these two are married.
 Well, well, well.
 (DOOR OPENING)
 (STAMMERING)
I'm supposed to knock.
 Forgive me, detective.
 Detective?
 Head detective. Sorry.
 I was told you wouldn't
be here until 6:00 tonight.
 That's right.
6:00 tonight.
Head detective.
 I changed my plan.
Please don't tell anyone.
 Absolutely, sir.
 Thanks. 6:00, huh?
 Is there anything
I can do for you
while I'm here?
 As a matter of fact,
yes, there is.
 We'd like a room
service menu
delivered immediately.
 In Lassiter's photo,
there didn't appear to be
a mark on that safe.
 I don't care
how good you are,
 you don't crack a hydra
without leaving some sort
of visible residue.
 We need to see that safe.
 That's going to be
a little difficult.
 How close you
need to be?
 Is there a secret back door
through the kitchen?
 No, we're gonna
take the air vents.
 Unfortunately, both my access
points are blocked
by Santa Barbara's finest.
 You think i'm
going in there?
 You know you want to.
Not in this suit.
 Gus, do you wanna see
the safe or not?
 Look, this will be easy.
We take this dumbwaiter
up to the grate,
 pop the screen,
crawl right through
the shafts.
 Three rights and a left.
We check our progress
through the vents.
 (EXCLAIMS)
 (WHIMPERS)
 Isn't it kind of weird
how the body's just
shoved in here?
 No, what's weird
is there's a dead guy
in a dumbwaiter
 and we're standing here
staring at it, waiting for
somebody to find us. Let's go!
 This is Lassiter's suspect.
 Shawn, close the hatch
and keep your voice down.
 I don't want to explain
how we got here.
 I just need to
see one thing.
 (CELL PHONE RINGING)
 You answered it. Hello?
 Three days, Shawn.
 Dad, hey, gonna
have to call you back.
 No, no. You were supposed
to call me yesterday.
 You were supposed to call me
the day before.
We need to handle this now.
 Dad, I'm a little
busy right now.
 Shawn, just tell me when
you are going to come by and
pick up the box of trophies?
 Really tough to be sure.
 Last week you were
all gung-ho about
getting this stuff back.
 I went upstairs,
I brought it down for you,
 it's sitting in the
middle of my kitchen table.
 I need my kitchen table,
Shawn.
 You're right.
Can I please call
you back, dad?
 How about you just
give me an answer?
 (STAMMERING) tonight.
No. Tomorrow.
 Tomorrow, wonderful.
 Otherwise,
I am putting it outside,
and that's where it's sitting.
 Now how hard was that?
 So easy. Anything else?
 No, unless, of course,
you need something.
 Nope. I'm good.
Well, actually, wait,
I do have one question.
 Go ahead.
 How long does it take
before a dead body
starts to smell bad?
 (LAUGHING) oh, god.
 Did you wipe
our fingerprints off?
 Of course I did.
We were never there.
 We need to call
the chief soon.
 If Dietrich was
a part of this,
he's not anymore.
 Why is it the attorney
general has to call me
 wondering why some civilian
is wandering around grilling
his entire family?
 Wait a second.
The attorney general
has your number?
 What are you guys, tight?
 Give it up.
What's the story?
 He also told me to keep
you out of here
by any means necessary,
 which opens up an entire world
of exciting possibilities
for me, personally.
 Ow!
 (GROANING)
 Gosh!
 Gosh!
 Oh, it's too much!
It's too much!
 You're not going
to shoot him, are you?
 I haven't decided.
 Oh, my ear.
Gus, my ear.
 Oh, for the love of mike,
you are not gonna escape.
Would you just give it up?
 Give it up!
 Check the dumbwaiter.
Open the dumbwaiter.
Detective O'Hara!
 Oh, my god!
 Lassister. Lassister.
 Lassy... get over here!
 Carlton: Let's go. Get him
in the van.
 Come on.
 You two, out.
 No. Don't we get to wait
around for the autopsy?
 No, we'll call you
if we need you.
 Detective.
 Sir?
Shut this down.
Keep it quiet.
 Nobody in the wedding party
is to know about this.
They've been through enough.
 Yes, sir.
 Maxwell: So, this is it.
 Well, that ought to keep
them busy for a while.
 Can we at least watch
the tape in another room
besides Lassiter's?
 Gus, he's not coming back.
Are you sure
about that?
 Yes, didn't you
check his messages?
 Are you gonna
have some cookies?
No.
 Do you wanna finish
my banana?
 I want to leave.
 Shawn: Look at the best man.
He's smashed.
 And look at his hair.
It's horrible.
 That's it?
 We have to watch it again.
 (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
 It's open.
 It's open?
What are you doing?
 Oh, what am I early?
 Big Dyl,
you're right on time.
 Did I forget to mention
that we're hosting
the bachelor party?
 No, thank you.
 He says, "uh-oh.
I thought you said you wanted
it inside the piñata."
 (ALL LAUGHING)
 Eat. Eat like men.
 You're really mad?
 We have less than 12
hours to solve the case,
 and you're throwing
a kegger in a police
officer's room.
 Why would I be mad?
 Gus, his best man was
a total washout, he wasn't
gonna plan anything.
 We have to dig information
out of suspects,
and you're wasting time.
 Dylan!
 Dude. You, wow!
 Yes, wow!
 Gus here has some
questions for you,
you flaxen-haired argonaut.
 Anything for you two.
I love you guys.
 I've found that they're
particularly forthcoming
 with information
while in this state.
 For example, i've
eliminated every
suspect here.
 Although there is
a guy stealing cable
 and another refilling
his minibar bottles
with shampoo,
 but I don't think
those are gateway crimes
to a jewelry heist.
 Seriously. Gus, come on,
give me a kiss.
 No, no, nothing weird,
on my cheek.
 Get me out of here.
I think it's
your turn to dig.
 Do you know
who stole the ring?
 No.
 And to be honest,
I don't care.
 I didn't even want
the damn thing.
 Okay. The night
that we announced
our engagement, no,
 my dad stops dinner right
in the middle of my speech.
 So, he goes and gets
my grandmother's ring.
 What am I supposed
to say? No?
 So, now it's not about us,
it's about him again.
 I mean, forget that
I just chose the person
 that I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.
 I don't wanna seem ungrateful,
 but if it were up to me,
 I'd sooner just stop looking.
 Cross him off.
 Dylan, how is dad?
 I mean, financially,
would you say everything is...
 (GROANS)
 Okay.
 So much for that.
 Dylan was the only
shot we had in this
room, but that's okay.
 We have other suspects
in this hotel.
 At least take a traveler.
 (ALL CHEERING)
 (EXCLAIMS)
 Sweet nectar.
 Yeah. All right.
 Crazy running into
you guys here.
What are the odds?
 You got anything?
These girls
are not criminals.
 It was worth a shot.
 You wanna get out of here?
 Yes, I do.
 So, how are you
holding up?
I'm good.
 My dad brought in all
this extra security
for some reason.
 Can he afford that?
What do you mean?
 I don't know, it's just... it
was a tough year financially
for a lot of people...
 what are you
getting at?
 I'm just making
random conversation.
 (GASPS)
Here's my bouquet.
 Oh, it's fantastic.
 Well, it's sub-par.
I was rushed.
All that craziness.
 I wish I could fix it.
 Well, let's just take it out.
 It's locked.
 They lock up flowers?
 I bet you could open it.
You have good hands.
 (ELEVATOR BELL DINGING)
 Shawn!
 Excuse me.
 You left me there!
 Yes, I did. And
you're very welcome.
 I just got a lap
dance from
Patrick Swayze!
 What do you mean?
Like an impersonator?
 No, I think it was
actually Patrick Swayze.
 I'm going home.
 We're done. All we've done
is eliminate suspects.
We're back where we started.
 Oh, Gus, we're fine.
 We've got the whole
wedding ceremony tomorrow
to solve the case.
 Oh, oh, okay. So, we
can do what an entire police
force can't in two hours?
 Hmm.
 Okay, you're right.
 We should totally get
there half an hour early.
 (EXCLAIMS)
 You are the most
beautiful bride
in this room.
 Oh, thank you.
 Does anyone need help?
 The bouquets
still aren't here.
 We might as well
not even have the ceremony.
 Okay, you, relax. Breathe.
 Think happy thoughts
like puffy clouds,
 mac and cheese,
Lou Diamond Phillips.
 Look, it worked.
 What are you doing?
Helping.
 No, those bouquets
are very specific.
 They look
identical, ma'am.
 It's my wedding,
shouldn't I be the one
freaking out?
 Oh, there'll be plenty
of time for that later.
 Where is it? Where?
Where's my bouquet?
 She's really a very nice
person under normal
circumstances.
 Lace?
Everything okay up here?
You all right?
 Yeah. Sorry. I think i'm
having sympathy bridezilla.
I'm good now.
 Great.
 Emma doesn't wanna
wear the flower
in her hair.
 But these are
magic flowers.
 (GASPS)
 Do you want one now?
 I don't know what
to tell you, sir,
but these are the charges.
 $1,600 for a
junior suite?
 With a queen bed?
 Well, the room was
a small portion.
 However, it's all your
room charges that drove
up your bill.
 I was hardly
even in the room!
 I'm sorry, detective Lassister,
but that's what it says here.
 This isn't
detective Lassister.
 I beg your pardon?
 Oh, he's a shorter guy.
Brown hair.
 Suede jacket. Helped
him fill the jacuzzi
with champagne last night.
 Really? If I brought
this man here,
could you identify him?
 Oh, absolutely.
In fact, I can tell
you where he is.
 He's over at
the Maxwell wedding.
 The chapel is just
outside the east lawn.
 I'll be right back.
 "I, Dylan, take you Bethany."
 I, Dylan, take you Bethany.
 "To be my wife."
To be my wife.
 Minister: "confidant
of my heart."
 Dylan: Confidant
of my heart.
 "That you will
be a faithful friend."
 That you will be
a faithful friend.
 "And a true and
loving companion."
 And a true and
loving companion.
 "I give to you my
sacred vow."
 Excuse me.
 I give to you
my sacred vow.
 I think we should
wait until
the ceremony's over.
 Fine.
 Nice suit. Where'd
you get that from?
 Gus, don't
underestimate me,
or my wardrobe.
 You might want to
remove...
 don't pull that off!
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
 Just slide it...
 they're here for you.
Not if I solve
this case first.
 Good plan. You got
about five minutes.
 I already know
who did it.
 No, you don't.
How is that possible?
 Between all that,
when you said
your girlfriend
 just had an aneurysm
because she got
the wrong bouquet,
 you had time to put
all that out of your mind
and solve the case?
 Gus.
What?
 And now for
a moment of silence.
 Gus, I seriously
do have a guess.
 Probability of
being right?
 I don't know,
high sixties.
 Close your mouth.
But the person's
in the room.
 (SHUSHING)
The thief could
potentially escape.
 Shouldn't i
stop the wedding?
No.
 Under no circumstances
are you allowed to
stop this wedding.
 If there's any reason
why these two
should not be wed,
 speak now or forever
hold your peace.
 I have something.
 It's not necessarily
marriage-related. I hope
that's not a problem.
 Sir, please.
 I know who
stole the ring.
 You cannot do this, Shawn.
This wedding has taken
over a year to plan.
 What are you doing?
 Radioing the chief.
 Shawn: I can see it.
 Chief Vick?
I can feel it.
 I can now feel the ring.
 It's in this room.
It's in the room.
It's in this room.
 They wouldn't bring
a stolen ring
to the ceremony, you moron.
 They would if they
couldn't get to it
till today.
 Lacey, I'm so sorry.
 And believe me when I say,
I really, really, really
wish it wasn't you.
 Me?
 Are you crazy?
 I'm the one who's
done all the work.
 Yes, you are.
 And we're all very impressed,
but it was also an
excellent cover, wasn't it?
 You are crazy, Shawn.
 And, by the way,
we're officially off
for next Friday.
 (CROWD MURMURING)
 Oh, boy! I can see it now.
 Shawn:
You're at the dinner table.
 They're announcing
the engagement.
 You're thrilled, of course.
You and Bethany have been
best friends forever.
 Dad... dad has a surprise
for the happy couple.
What could it be?
 Wait a minute.
 You didn't know the ring
was going to Dylan.
 You were always your
grandmother's favorite
 and you're the oldest girl.
That ring should
be yours, right?
 Right.
 You were counting
on that ring.
 It was your future.
 Oh!
 (GASPS)
 Sorry.
 I can see you plotting.
 I can see you plotting
right there at the
dinner table.
 But dad...
dad throws a curve ball.
 No, it was a slider.
 He's overly cautious
because sometimes
engagements end.
 Not you guys. It's okay.
 They're not letting go
of the ring
until the wedding,
 which means you have
a very small window
within which to grab it.
 Does all this have anything
to do with why these two
shouldn't be married?
 No, sir. No.
It doesn't at all, actually.
 (CLEARS THROAT)
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
 Oh, boy!
 Of course, you insisted it be
used during the rehearsal
 so then you had your chance.
 While everyone else
was fawning over the ring,
you made one final adjustment.
 It looked like you
just straightened it out
and put it right back,
 but you never did, did you?
 No, Lacey,
 because you have magic hands,
 which I was really
looking forward
to on Friday.
 Everyone was fooled.
 Everyone was fooled,
 except Dietrich Mannheim,
 who hadn't yet discovered
how to use this information
to his benefit.
 This is first-rate
fiction, Shawn.
 Unfortunately,
there's no evidence.
 There would have been
no evidence if you could have
gotten away that night.
 But there was a problem.
 (GROANS)
 Yes, you were called away.
 (SNIFFING)
 The florist.
 The florist bailed on you.
The bouquets.
 You got a last minute
batch of materials,
 and the bouquets would now
have to be crafted by hand.
 There was no other
time but now.
 You looked for a way out,
but there was none.
 You had a $5 million ring
that was about to be
discovered missing any minute,
 hidden in your palm,
 and you were gonna have
to pull an all-nighter in a
room with eight other people.
 You thought you could
get back into the cooler
later and grab it,
 but they kept
their flowers locked up.
 So, you had to have
your specific bouquet,
or else.
 Lacey, you're not
an unreasonable person.
 You're just a thief.
 (GUESTS MURMURING)
 Or at least you were a thief,
 until Dietrich Mannheim
called and told you
that he was on to you.
 He wanted a piece of
that action, too.
Or he was going to the police.
 You tried to talk him down,
but he got rough.
 It got ugly.
 It was all spinning
out of control.
 Eventually, they were going
to find that body, so you
started laying out clues.
 You sent the police off
in all directions
 because you'd grown up
hearing all about
crime scenes.
 I would say that's fortuitous,
because you knew just
what to leave, didn't you?
 I have worked 18 hours
a day on this wedding.
 I have sacrificed
my weekends.
 I will not be
treated this way.
 Then show us
your bouquet, Lacey.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
She's running?
In those heels, really?
 We have to chase her, too?
 But we have no evidence
except for that ring!
 (LACEY SCREAMS)
 Dude, you're next.
 Come on. You're still
angry, even after i
solved your crime?
 Is this the man?
 No.
 This guy was
not in my room?
 I've never seen him before.
 You got a room?
 Why?
 We should have a party.
 Get out of my sight.
 (IN BRITISH ACCENT)
Thank you, Bobby.
 Interpol appreciates
both of your efforts.
 (SIGHS)
 I love weddings.
Don't you?
 I didn't exactly think it
was appropriate for
you to give the toast.
 Well, the best man
was unprepared.
Someone had to step in.
 Besides, it was
like a practice run
for your wedding.
 You are not gonna
be my best man.
 You bet your ass I am.
 I've already picked out
which song I'm singing
at the altar.
 Really?
 You still like
Ted Nugent?
 Remind me to show you
your vows.
 They're going to
make you cry.
