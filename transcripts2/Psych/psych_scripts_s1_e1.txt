 Dad, why do those people
get better seats than us?
 WITNESS: Your Honor,
It's not that I...
 Shawn, those people aren't
just watchlng the trlal.
Those people are the trlal.
 They're the jurors,
 and they're the most
Important people In thls room.
 They are?
 The thlng about
the jury Is, Shawn,
 you gotta learn
how to look at them,
how to read them.
 For Instance, take a look
at juror number flve.
 He's the guy In the front row,
second one from the left.
 Tell me what you see. Go.
 Brown shlrt,
Ilttle hole In hls collar.
 Hls coat Is too tlght on hlm.
 He's got rough hands,
he's looklng down mostly
and noddlng a lot.
 Good, good.
 All rlght, let's take
that hole In hls collar.
 Now, would Mom ever
let you leave the house
looklng Ilke that?
 Never.
 You belleve It.
 So, that tells us that
he's probably not marrled.
 That's called
deductlve reasonlng.
 LAWYER: Your Honor,
the people call Detectlve
Henry L. Spencer to the stand.
 All rlght, watch closely, kld.
 One day you're gonna walk up
the steps of thls courthouse
 and you're gonna make
your old man proud.
 Gus, they Impounded
my motorcycle wlthout warnlng.
 I'm pretty sure the warnlng
was the $900 worth of
parklng tlckets you racked up.
 Stlll, man, you can't take
a man's means
of transportatlon away.
 It's, Ilke, unconstltutlonal
or somethlng.
 I'm pretty sure
It's not In the Constltutlon.
 Oh, don't be so sure.
 I thlnk It says, "Thou shalt
not somethlng,
or covet somethlng.
 "Don't mess wlth Texas
or the rlght
of transportatlon."
 You're thlnklng
of a commandment.
 That's even better.
Can we just pay thls tlcket
 so we can get out
of here, please?
 You gotta be klddlng me.
We came all the way over here,
 and now you're not
gonna walt In the Ilne?
 Gus, dld you see It In there?
It's a tlcket payment Ilne,
 not Space Mountaln.
Hardly worth It.
 Plus, I don't walt In Ilnes.
What do you mean
you don't walt In Ilnes?
 Everyone walts In Ilnes.
That's what we do as people,
we walt In Ilnes.
 I don't.
It's not In my nature.
 (CELL PHONE RINGING)
That makes no sense, Shawn.
 You remember the story
of the scorplon and the frog?
 (SHUSHING) Burton Guster.
They're both on the rlverbank.
The scorplon's Ilke, "Hey"...
 The polnt Is I shouldn't
have gotten any tlckets, Gus.
 I was uslng
my ambassador plates.
 Ambassador plates?
You're not
an ambassador, Shawn.
 Impersonatlng
a government offlclal
wlll land you In jall.
 I am an ambassador,
of sorts.
 I am a goodwlll ambassador
to Paraguay.
 To where?
Paraguay.
 It Is an honorary tltle
that I recelved
 after overseelng
all sand castle constructlon
at a South Amerlcan Club Med.
 You never worked at Club Med.
 Ooh, turn that up.
 Someone we know,
someone we love,
 someone we invited into our...
 I just saw that woman
at the courthouse.
 That's Sandra Panltch,
the fourth grade teacher
who murdered Jackson Hale.
 Don't you watch the news?
I can't watch
Channel 8 anymore.
 Lloyd Lanslng wears a toupee.
It's Ilke every newscast
starts wlth a Ile.
 I can't stand thls guy.
Somethlng about hlm
just Irks me. Llsten to hlm.
 Sandra Panitch went with
weatherman Jackson Jale
to his Channel 8 news studio,
 engaged in sexual relations
with him,
 and then stabbed him
in the heart
with a letter opener.
 She fled the scene,
but not without leaving behind
 a mountain
of physical evidence,
 including a trail
of the victim's blood,
 and her fingerprints
all over the murder weapon.
 This is why the state
is going after murder one.
 But she dldn't do It!
What?
 Gus, I'm gettlng
a very strong feellng here.
 I thlnk that woman
Is Innocent.
 I do watch the news,
and I've been
followlng thls case.
 They have a mountaln
of evldence agalnst thls lady.
 Look, they call her
the "School Marm Murderer."
 Okay, flrst of all,
there's a questlon mark
at the end of that.
 They call her the
"School Marm Murderer?"
 Even the news people
aren't convlnced.
 And today at the courthouse,
In the mlddle
of a conversatlon,
 I saw her bend over
and plck up a plece of trash!
 Oh, I see.
So because she plcks up
somebody's KltKat wrapper
 means she dldn't klll anybody?
That makes sense.
 Gus, she dldn't
have to do that.
 The woman Is about to be
on trlal for her Ilfe.
 She takes tlme out
for common courtesy?
 That Is not the mlndset
of a cold-blooded murderer.
No!
 Thls Is what I know.
She looked at me
rlght In the eyes.
 Now, there are a lot of tells
that people have
 when they are trylng
to appear not gullty.
 The way that they slt,
crosslng thelr legs,
uncrosslng them,
 crosslng them back, eye Ilnes
to Inanlmate objects,
twltchlng, Itchlng, rubblng.
 All of these affectatlons,
I am an expert on all of them.
 But there Is one thlng
that you cannot change
no matter how hard you try,
 and that Is the tent
on the wlndows to the soul.
 (REPORTERS CJATTERING ON TV)
 Adam Jornstock,
attorney for the defense.
 Sandra Panitch
is a victim of circumstance,
 of being in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
 I know.
Look at thls poor guy.
 Look, he's hunched over,
he's not maklng eye contact.
 Look at the handkerchlef
In the left pocket, there.
 It's not decoratlve, Gus.
That's crumpled and stalned.
 That's used for
dabblng sweat, a lot.
 Her lawyer's a beaten man.
 Whether he knows It or not,
Adam Hornstock needs us.
 What are you talklng about?
 Dude, we're golng to be
legal consultants.
 It's awesome.
 (SINGING) I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth
 I know, you know
They just don't have any proof
 Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend
 Your worst inhibitions
tend to psych you out
in the end
 (ALL CHATTERING)
 Ooh, let's get In there
and grab seats.
 How? You thlnk
that court offlcer Is guardlng
the door for hls health?
 Just roll wlth me on thls.
 Excuse me, people.
Comlng through!
 Shawn Spencer here. Spencer.
That's S-P-E-N-C-E-R.
 Thls Is my partner,
Burton Guster. G-U...
 Look, I know I've been
reluctant to go on record
 about thls trlal
up to thls polnt...
 I'm sorry, who are you?
 What Is thls,
Journallsm 101?
 I glve my statement,
you berate me wlth your
rudlmentary Q and A later.
 In fact, you two
swltch places.
 Come here. Excuse me.
Come on, don't be shy.
 He puts hls pants on
one leg at a tlme.
I do.
 As I was saylng,
thls trlal Is not about
a partlcular case.
 It Is about our rlghts
as cltlzens.
 No one, and I mean no one,
should ever wake up
and I don't know, let's say,
 flnd that thelr motorcycle
has been taken away from them.
 As thls trlal moves forward,
I'll have more to say.
That Is all. Thank you.
 Motorcycle? Whose motorcycle
are we talklng about here?
Dld...
 Guys, please.
Please, glve them space.
Please.
 Are we ready yet,
Mr. Hornstock?
 Oh, yes.
Just one moment, slr. Ah!
 You know, I was pre-law once.
Maybe I should have
stuck wlth It.
 You were never pre-law.
Well, I was pre-pre-law.
 Slxth grade,
but It was
an accelerated program.
 I won a mock trlal
of Tortoise v. Jare,
you know.
 The hare dld It.
Of course he dld.
 The court wlll take
a short recess,
and then perhaps,
 Mr. Hornstock, we can
get golng wlth
these proceedlngs.
 (BANGS GAVEL)
 Dude, we're so hlred.
We are?
 Watch thls.
 Excuse me,
Mr. Hornstock?
Rlght?
 You don't know me.
My name's Shawn Spencer.
 I'm the lead psychlc detectlve
at the SBPD.
 Yeah, I'm a Ilttle busy
rlght now.
 I can see. You're dolng
a bang up job.
Please don't stop.
 I just... I thlnk maybe
you should be
a Ilttle careful.
 Of?
Juror number four.
 Juror... Oh, yeah?
Why Is that?
 Somethlng about you
really bothers her.
 And somethlng about her
bothers me.
 I mean, she's been frownlng
at me the whole tlme,
 and I haven't even
gone up yet.
 Here's the thlng.
She's a fashlon maven.
 She has a problem
wlth your appearance,
 and untll you change It,
I don't thlnk she's gonna
Ilsten to a word you say.
 My appearance?
The manner In whlch
you appear.
 Your look.
 I don't know exactly
what the problem Is,
but let's check It out.
 Why don't you glve me the...
Glve me the 360 cat dance
real fast, huh?
 (CLAPS)
 Excuse me?
Just twlrl It up for me,
and then twlrl It rlght back.
 (SCOFFS)
There It Is. And back.
 Sult, pleated. I would have
gone wlth a three button,
 maybe somethlng
In a wool-cotton blend,
 but I don't thlnk
that's the problem.
 Sldeburns? Check.
Halr, bold,
Strokes, Hlves.
 I don't thlnk
that's the problem.
 The shoes, not a splt shlne,
but Ilke you sald,
you haven't gotten up yet,
 so I can't make
heads or... Whoa!
 What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
 I thlnk It's the tle.
What? My tle?
 What's wrong wlth my tle?
Well, It's a Ilttle blt...
 Well, look, It's not
Ilke my favorlte tle...
 I'm so glad
to hear you
say that.
 Gus?
What?
 (WHISPERING) Qulck,
glve me your tle.
I'm not glvlng you my tle.
 It's a good tle!
Glve me your tle, please.
 It's a Thomas Plnk tle.
One second.
 Why don't you
glve me the tle?
Just once wlll you...
 Come on, Shawn!
 Look hlgh, reach low.
Got It.
 Now, we're also
golng to take thls.
 Prlmarlly because
It's covered In sweat,
 but also because It reads
crulse shlp walter to me.
 Crulse shlp?
Go get 'em!
 And so, I wlll demonstrate
to the court
 that Sandra Panltch
Is an upstandlng cltlzen
wlth no crlmlnal record,
 and the dlstrlct attorney
has rushed to the prosecutlon
of an Innocent woman.
 Are you flnlshed now,
Mr. Hornstock?
 Hmm? Ah! Oh, yes.
Yes, Your Honor.
 Brllllant.
 Well, thlngs are
flnally movlng along.
 Court wlll recess
tlll after lunch.
 Dld you see that?
That was amazlng!
Dld you see that?
 That was a whole 180!
 Well, It's a pretty
amazlng tle.
 Hey, strong shag,
strong tle,
strong person.
 You know, guys,
I would hlre you In a second.
It's just...
 Well, I, I don't
have the authorlzatlon.
 My flrm doesn't really
belleve In...
 Wlnnlng?
No.
 Mermalds?
No.
 The Mlnotaur?
No, me.
 Yeah, at least not anymore.
 No, there's no buts here.
 A lot of the cases
my partner Gus and I take,
we do for free.
 It's called pro bono.
 Gus?
What?
 A Ilttle decorum,
we're In a courtroom.
 Congratulatlons,
you got yourself a couple
of legal consultants.
 Wow.
Oh, boy.
 Dld he just grab your flst?
And then he shook It.
 Well, well, well,
what do we have here?
 HI, Jules.
 Please tell me you're not
one of those
courtroom grouples
 that bounces
from trlal to trlal?
 Walt a second, was that you
at the Mlchael Jackson hearlng
 wlth the sequlned glove
and the shlrt that sald,
 "Please free the man
In the mlrror"?
 That's actually
really funny, Shawn.
 Detectlve Lasslter Is the one
who actually made
the arrest of Sandra Panltch.
 See, that makes It my case.
 What a colncldence.
It's also our case.
 Yeah, we just slgned on
as legal consultants
to the defense just now.
 And you wlll sell your Ilttle
sldeshow act to anyone
who'll Ilsten, won't you?
 Just don't screw thls one up.
 "Don't screw thls up"?
 Hey, Lassy, that really
wasn't much of a put down.
 In fact It was
somewhat Insplrlng.
 Las, let's roll that back!
 I don't know.
It feels a Ilttle welrd.
 I mean, you should really
be slttlng here.
Thls Is your offlce.
 Yeah, thls Isn't my offlce.
 You dldn't Ilke mlne.
Thls Is Carter Jareckl's
offlce, one of the partners.
 Actually, he's the guy
who took the case
In the flrst place,
 but then dumped It on me
when he declded
It was a lost cause.
 You see, that's exactly
what I'm talklng about.
 Why dldn't you stand up
to that guy?
 For the worst reason posslble.
I actually belleve
thls woman Is Innocent.
 (SIGHING) Now, can we please
go before Jareckl gets back?
 Carter Jareckl just left for
a nooner wlth hls mlstress.
We have at least two hours.
 Maybe an hour and a half.
 Hornstock, I thlnk
you have the potentlal
to be a fantastlc lawyer.
 You just need confldence.
After all, that's your name
on the door. Now come on!
 Oh, no. No. None of those
Hornstocks are me.
 The flrst one
Is my grandfather,
he founded the flrm.
 The other one Is my father,
then my brother.
 Wow. A whole
famlly of lawyers?
 Yeah, even my slster.
 Well, there you go.
She dldn't make the door.
 She's Blederman.
It's her marrled name.
 Well, we're gonna need
to take a look
at your wltness Ilst
 and your deposltlon
transcrlpts.
 Oh, yeah. Well, I prepared
all that for you.
 I have... Here are
all the forenslc
and arrest reports.
 And I deposed several
of Hale's coworkers
from Channel 8,
 mostly to refute tlmellnes
and for character testlmony.
 Can we see those?
 Oh, sure, yeah. It's...
 (CHUCKLING)
 Oh, yes.
 And maybe, later on
we can read the phonebook,
just for fun.
 Hornstock, I've gotta do
what I do.
 That's not the way I do It.
 I need to see,
feel and smell people
 In order to flgure out
what happens.
 Smell them?
 So, thls Is where the...
The crlme took place.
 So, just feel free
to have a look around,
 and do whatever It Is
you do.
 Okay.
Thank you.
 Let's walk the crlme,
shall we?
Yeah.
 He probably came In from
that same entrance we dld.
Rlght.
 Found thelr way over here
to the Channel 8
anchor desk area.
 Of course, the body
was found here.
 It was a short walk.
Yeah.
 Prlscllla, what are these
green walls for?
 Oh, well we do It all
on green screen.
 Really? Can you show me
how that works, please?
 Sure, I just need someone
to slt In front.
 Gus, go slt over there.
 I'm not golng to slt there
just 'cause
you tell me to, Shawn.
 Flne, I'll...
I'll play anchorman.
 I got It. I got It.
 (SHAWN CLEARS THROAT)
 Okay, so we've just have to
go to the control room.
It's just thls way.
 Okay.
 (DOING VOCAL EXERCISES)
 You know when we're watchlng
the weather guy,
 and It looks Ilke he's got,
Ilke, ralnfall behlnd hlm?
Yeah.
 Or snow or hall?
Yeah.
 How does that work?
Well, the green
background works
 as a blank slate.
Then I just run It
through the board
 and presto!
 A composlte
of the two Images
Is made.
 Oh, oh! Can we
get sound In here?
 Yeah, yeah. Sure.
 (GUS DOING VOCAL EXERCISES)
 In local news,
 a pharmaceutical
representative
again provided
 the key piece of information
in a baffling police case.
 But ran screamlng
from the scene,
 Ilke a Ilttle glrl before
he could make a statement.
 That was one tlme, Shawn!
One tlme!
I don't Ilke dead bodles!
 I told you that.
Now stop brlnglng that up!
 Hello, thls Is
your local news.
 (DOING VOCAL EXERCISES)
 Thls next offlce
was Jackson Hale's.
 I've got to tell you guys,
everybody's been actlng
a Ilttle welrd
 slnce It happened.
It's just not the same.
 Oh! Ruben, thls Is
Shawn Spencer
and Burton Guster.
 They're worklng
on Jackson Hale's case.
 Thls Is Ruben Leonard,
he's a lab meteorologlst
on Jackson's team.
 RUBEN: Was.
 I was just sortlng and packlng
 some of hls more
Important thlngs
to send to hls famlly.
 It's the least I can do.
 That's very thoughtful.
 Thank you.
 That reminds me
of a hot, little
seÃ±orlta I met there.
 She was serving
fried jalapenos...
 Would you excuse me?
Sure.
 Sure.
Thanks.
 JALE: So,
if you'll notice that...
 Dld you work
wlth Jackson Hale long?
 Slx years. He was a great man.
 I had a lot
of respect for hlm.
 He was just so good
at what he dld.
 Take your umbrella
because I guarantee,
 it's raining cats and dogs
out there.
 A broadcastlng treasure.
 Anyway,
take a look
at Thursday here...
 (WHISPERING) Dude,
 Ruben's In there
destroylng Hale's awards.
 What?
Yeah.
 Unless he's really
offended by the shoddy
engravlng on the plaque,
 that guy hates Jackson Hale.
I'm not saylng he dld It,
but reasonable doubt, anyone?
 Okay, Mlss Panltch.
Please, walk us through
the nlght of the crlme.
 Well, I never met Mr. Hale
before that nlght.
 I just moved here
from Wlsconsln.
 It wasn't Ilke
I was a fan of hls.
 I only vaguely knew
he was a weatherman.
 So we talked,
and he was charmlng...
 So the scratches
on Jackson Hale's back
 and hls skln under
your the flngernalls,
 thls all happened
durlng the sex,
 as well as the brulses
on your arm?
 It got passlonate.
 I don't remember anythlng
untll I woke up
the next mornlng.
 Wlth hls blood on you?
 And then you fled
to the parklng lot?
 Look, I was scared.
 I, I know how bad
all of thls looks, I do.
 But I swear
I dld not murder anyone.
 Do you guys belleve me?
Do you?
 Of course we do, Sandra.
Don't be rldlculous.
 Counselor?
Yes?
 Would you please retlre
wlth me to the hallway,
 where we can exchange words
In hushed tones?
 Okay, what are you dolng?
What?
 You are supposed to be
demonstratlng confldence
and swagger for Hornstock.
 Instead you're poklng holes
In our case, and you're
scarlng our defendant.
 Here are the facts, Shawn.
All we know about Sandra
Is what she's told us.
 I thlnk we need
to do some Investlgatlng.
 I belleve her.
Hornstock belleves her.
What else do we need?
 We need proof, Shawn.
 Look, rlght here In thls book?
 Corey v. Bulevic In 1955.
The key plece of evldence
were half-melted candlestlcks.
 We need evldence!
Where are our candlestlcks,
Shawn?
 Maybe you just
jumped over them?
 What?
Be nlmble. Be qulck.
 You're not golng to glve me
anythlng for that?
 Now can we please...
 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Check out the judge.
 He's grabblng hls back.
No wonder he's so grumpy.
 He's not grabblng hls back,
he's grabblng hls kldneys.
 He probably
has a kldney stone.
 Dude, nlce!
Thank you.
 Please state to the court
what your relatlonshlp
wlth Mr. Hale was.
 It was professlonal.
He was my boss.
I was hls receptlonlst.
 And as the Channel 8
receptlonlst, Mlss Osterman,
 If people were to call
Jackson Hale,
you took those calls?
 I dld.
 And dld you recelve any calls
from the defendant,
Sandra Panltch, at any tlme?
 Oh, not to my knowledge. No.
 But other women would call?
 Sure.
 Was Jackson Hale
sleeplng wlth these women?
 Objectlon, Your Honor,
hearsay.
 I'll allow the questlon.
 Well, I can only say that
I flelded many calls,
 and sometlmes I helped
to juggle these calls.
 He was a handsome man.
 He certalnly was.
 Thank you, Mlss Osterman.
 JUDGE LELAND:
You may step down,
Mlss Osterman.
 Thanks.
 Your Honor, the state requests
a moment to prepare
for our next wltness.
 "He certalnly was"?
What happened?
You were rolllng!
 I don't know, I don't know,
It sounded good In my head.
 You have a great
support system, you know,
 It glves you
that easy confldence.
 But, you know,
my father hasn't been
In the courtroom once.
 Not one of my trlals.
 You've been here one day,
and your father's
already here.
 What are you talklng about?
 Oh, I met hlm outslde.
He's a really nlce guy.
 (CLEARING THROAT) Your Honor,
the defense would Ilke to call
for a recess.
 Excuse me. Who are you?
 I'm sorry, Your Honor.
My name Is Shawn Spencer.
 I'm a psychlc legal consultant
on thls case.
 Objectlon, Your Honor. We were
not made aware that a psychlc
was hlred on thls case.
 Approach the bench,
all of you.
 Sweet.
 Your Honor, the people
questlon hls valldlty.
 Okay, flrst of all,
that's hurtful.
 Look, I know you're
the blg bad prosecutor
 wlth the sweet head,
but Is thls tone
really necessary?
 No. Look,
I'm a legltlmate consultant.
 I've been hlred often
by the Santa Barbara
Pollce Department,
 and there Is a hlgh-ranklng
detectlve In thls very
courtroom rlght now,
 who wlll vouch
for my valldlty.
 And who Is thls?
 He's rlght there. The wlspy,
yet commandlng Irlsh fellow,
 who looks Ilke
he's been sucklng on
the Sour Patch Klds.
 Wlll you stand
and state your name
for the court?
 Carlton Lasslter,
Santa Barbara Pollce
Department, Your Honor.
 Head detectlve,
11 years thls May.
 Perhaps you'd Ilke to
Inform the court of your
favorlte color as well.
 The polnt Is,
do you know thls man?
 I do.
 And has he worked on cases
for the department?
 He has.
 There you have It.
There you have It.
 And he was helpful?
 Absolutely.
 Dld he just say absolutely
wlth a Ilttle half smlle?
 I'd Ilke that
prlnted out, please.
 I'm thlnklng of shellacklng It
on a nlce plece of maple,
maybe a Ilttle decoupage.
 Your Honor, as you can see,
I'm responslble
 for breaklng many cases here
In the state of Callfornla.
 Well, guess what? I don't care
who you are, or what
you've done for the state.
 I don't belleve In that
psychlc mumbo-jumbo and It's
not welcome In my court!
 "Mumbo-jumbo"?
 (GASPING) Oh!
You poor, poor man.
 No wonder. You're...
 (WHISPERING)
Passlng a kldney stone
can be very stressful.
 Who told you that?
I never told anyone.
 You tell me If
I'm overstepplng
my bounds here,
 but I'd Ilke to suggest an old
home remedy that dld wonders
for my Aunt Dolores.
 She slmply gargled
wlth some mlneral water,
 followed It up
wlth some raw greens.
 Me, personally,
I'd go wlth asparagus tlps,
 that way, later on,
when you're maklng water,
 you'll know that It's worklng.
 Let's proceed wlth the trlal.
 Okay, you got me?
I'm startled.
What are you dolng here?
 Well, maybe
we're both psychlcs.
 I am serlous.
 Occaslonally,
I come down here,
I slt In on a trlal.
 Today, I get a phone call.
 Guess who's practlclng
law now?
 Walt a mlnute.
You come down
here regularly?
 Thursdays, usually.
Today was just a bonus.
 My God, you just
can't let go, can you?
 You retlred too early.
Not my fault. I dldn't ask you
to turn In your badge, Dad.
 Shawn! Shawn! Shawn!
I'm In there
trylng to do somethlng...
 You seem to forget whose name
you've got at the end
of your letterhead, kld.
 When you use my name,
It Is my buslness as well.
 Glve me my phone.
 Took you long enough
to flgure out
the kldney stone.
 Let It be noted that
the wltness Identlfled
the defendant, Sandra Panltch,
 as the woman he saw runnlng
through the parklng lot
on the nlght of the murder.
 Has It been authentlcated?
 Hey, what would Phelps need
to get authentlcated?
 (SIGHING) I don't know.
 Hls Ilttle collectlon
of green army men?
 H-Stock, dld you just
make a joke?
 Hmm?
I thlnk you dld.
 (CHUCKLES)
 Your wltness.
Does the defense
wlsh to cross-examlne?
 Your Honor, the defense rests.
 (COUGHING) No. No, It doesn't.
 Your Honor,
the defense may rest.
Why am I not restlng?
 I have a vlbe
that's very strong.
 Hatred, jealousy.
That guy wanted to be
a serlous weatherman.
 He has no sympathy
for Jackson Hale whatsoever.
 Walt. What?
You thlnk he dld It?
 No, I'm pretty sure he dldn't.
 But we can plant a seed.
 Johnny Applestock.
 Your Honor, the defense
does not rest.
 Mr. Leonard,
you are a meteorologlst,
are you not?
 Yes, I am Indeed.
 But not on the alr?
 No, not on the alr.
 Hmm.
Maybe because you don't have
a meteorologlst name.
 RUBEN: I don't follow.
 Well, correct me If I'm wrong,
 but Leonard Isn't a term
for any klnd of weather?
 No, It Is not.
 So, If I was to look up
Leonard, In say,
a weather glossary,
 there would be no deflnltlon?
 No, there would not.
 Excuse me,
where Is thls golng?
 Yes, Mr. Hornstock,
where are you golng wlth thls?
 I'm sorry, Your Honor,
It's just that every
successful weatherman
 that I know of,
has a real weatherman's name.
 Johnny Mountaln, Dallas Ralns?
 Oh, Jackson Hale, for example.
 Hey, flrst of all that
wasn't even hls real name.
 Preclsely.
 Have you ever consldered
golng by the name
of Bolt Llghtnlng?
 No.
 Cloudy McMlllen?
No.
 Wendy Mornlng Dew?
 That's a woman's name.
Okay, look, I have a degree
 In meteorology from
the Unlverslty of Vlrglnla.
 I wrote my thesls
on Bernoulll's theorem
 of Incompresslble level flow,
 and I was a junlor tornado
safety captaln
for seven years.
 Jackson Hale
has a degree In what?
 Physlcal educatlon
from a junlor college.
 He was an embarrassment.
He was worthless, all rlght?
 He was worthless to anyone
who was a real meteorologlst
Ilke myself.
 He should have been stabbed
In the heart long ago!
 Objectlon, Your Honor.
 (LELAND BANGING GAVEL)
 It's a Ilttle late for that,
don't you thlnk, Counselor?
 That's the klnd of confldence
I'm talklng about.
 That's what I'm talklng about.
 We are on our way
to wlnnlng thls thlng.
 Told you. She's klnd
and she's Innocent.
 Just because we had
a small vlctory In court
yesterday
 doesn't mean
we're out of the woods.
 Son of a bltch!
 JULIET: Alllgator pumps!
I swear, I should arrest
that weatherman.
 He clearly stated
It was not golng to
raln today.
 You see, that's the problem
wlth what I Ilke to call
"group thlnklng."
 We don't Ilsten
to group thlnkers.
 Nope.
 In fact, we don't Ilsten
to weathermen at all.
 If you excuse me,
I've really got
better thlngs to do.
 Dlnner wlth your cat?
 O'Hara, are you comlng?
 You go. I'll catch up
wlth you In a sec.
 You know, Shawn,
for a psychlc,
 you are mlsslng somethlng
rlght In front of your face.
It's too bad.
 You mlght actually learn
somethlng about Lasslter.
Maybe you don't want to.
 He waxes hls back?
 I'm gonna go now.
 Shawn, I don't care what
anyone else says.
The plnk shlrt Is worklng.
 Okay, that was cryptlc.
 Not really. I'll be damned.
 Who's Detectlve Assl?
 Lassy. It's Lasslter.
He must have sent some sort
of memo to Phelps.
 The questlon Is
why would Lasslter
 send a letter
to the D.A.'s offlce?
 Don't you ever watch
Law and Order?
 They tend to work
together sometlmes.
 Rlght. So... So, go ahead
and check the flles,
 and flnd me that letter.
 Phelps recelved It
on the seventh.
 I've been through all of them.
 There are no memos submltted
Into evldence,
flled on the seventh.
 So, It dldn't get flled.
But there Is a memo.
 So whatever's on that memo
Is clearly worth hldlng.
 And she told you
thls dlrectly?
 Yes, when I questloned
the defendant,
 she admltted to havlng
sexual relatlons
wlth the vlctlm.
 But not to stabblng hlm
wlth a letter opener?
 Well, she appeared at the tlme
to be confused
and had memory gaps.
 She clalmed never
to have seen or touched
the weapon.
 Even though her flngerprlnts
were all over It. I see.
 Thank you, Detectlve Lasslter.
Nothlng further.
 Your wltness.
 You sure about thls?
 Yes, I have a very strong
feellng about thls letter.
 Flrst rule of trlal law,
never ask a questlon
you don't know the answer to.
 Hey, have I steered
you wrong yet? Come on.
 Detectlve Lasslter,
dld you send a letter
 to the D.A.'s offlce
on the seventh of August?
 Yes, I dld.
 And what dld It say?
 I... Objectlon,
lack of foundatlon.
 I'll allow It. Go ahead,
tell the jury what It sald.
 It questloned
the defendant's motlve.
 That It was
very strong, you mean?
 No, It questloned
whether I belleved
the defendant had one at all.
 (SCOFFS)
 The prosecutlon never
submltted thls letter
Into evldence.
 So, at thls polnt,
Your Honor, the defense
calls for a mlstrlal.
 (CROWD MURMURING)
 Man, thls Is fun!
 Approach the bench.
 We may have
recelved the letter.
I... I can't be sure.
 We dldn't knowlngly
wlthhold It.
 My offlce Is
wall to wall papers.
 Then go to Staples
and buy yourself some new
flle folders,
 but untll then,
you are warned.
 Any new evldence
must be submltted to
all partles Immedlately.
 Do I make myself clear?
 Yes, Your Honor.
 And In the splrlt
of that rullng,
 I would Ilke to submlt
a new plece of evldence.
 If thls Is that wllly-nllly
plece of evldence
that you trled to get In,
 In pre-trlal,
I'll tell you one more tlme.
 I wlll not admlt any
audlo-vlsual evldence unless
It's been authentlcated.
 We're talking about
playing it to him.
 It's a vldeotape.
 Hmm?
 We just got our
authentlcatlon papers
from the lab In Sacramento.
 It Is a vldeotape
of the defendant,
Sandra Panltch,
 murderlng the vlctlm,
Jackson Hale.
 (CROWD MURMURING)
 Judge, I argue that thls tape
should not be admlsslble.
 On what grounds?
 Well, we're cltlng
unfalr surprlsery.
 I... I stlll don't understand
why he Is In thls room.
 He's nothlng but a dlsruptlon.
 Maybe someday, Phelps,
when you're a judge,
 whlch I hlghly doubt
wlll happen,
 then you can declde
who's welcome
In your chambers.
 Your Honor, these guys
are a part of my team,
and I want them here.
 Why? You used to be
a good lawyer, Hornstock.
 But let's face It, If you've
gotta resort to hlrlng
thls Idlot psychlc
 and hls Ilttle sldeklck...
 I'm nobody's sldeklck, you...
 Whoa! Gus, Gus.
Come on.
 Forget you.
 Gus, we are all grown men
here. Let's just take a beat.
 Let's...
Let's take a step back.
 Let's take a step back.
 (GRUNTS)
 Mr. Hornstock, havlng now
seen the vldeo In questlon,
 I don't thlnk I need
to tell you
how damaglng It Is.
 I strongly suggest
at thls polnt
 that you conslder acceptlng
a plea bargaln for murder two.
 Your Honor, I wlll
have to revlew the tape
and confer wlth my cllent.
 PHELPS:
I tell you what,
Hornstock.
 I wlll leave murder two
on the table
untll tomorrow mornlng.
 Conslder that
my glft to you.
 (MO ANING)
 She doesn't reallze
she's belng taped.
 No, I don't thlnk thls
Is hls flrst barbeque elther,
 If you know what I mean.
 Thls hlgh-def plasma
really makes a dlfference.
 I see the beads of sweat
on hls neck.
 Look at hls halr!
 That's horrlble!
 (SIGJING)
 JALE: Yeah.
 Oh, wow!
 (BO TJ MO ANING)
 Do any of you
make nolses Ilke that?
 Hls or hers?
 (JALE SCREAMING)
 (CLEARS THROAT)
 When she sees thls,
she wlll certalnly
take the deal.
 I'm not golng to
take the deal.
 If you don't take the deal,
you could go away
posslbly for Ilfe.
 You do reallze thls?
I don't care.
 I'm not gonna admlt
to somethlng that I dldn't do!
 Okay, I belleve you.
I belleve you.
But I watched that tape.
 And as your attorney,
I am begglng you,
take the deal.
 Don't take the deal.
 What are you dolng?
 You're supposed to be
on my slde.
 Hornstock, I am on your slde.
 I mean, not technlcally,
because of the
shape of thls table.
 Imaglne a round table.
I would have sat
somewhere In the mlddle.
 Okay, tomorrow mornlng
when the jury
watches thls tape,
 we wlll lose thls case.
 Thls tape Is not
telllng us the whole truth.
There's more.
 I need to take thls tape.
You just work
on your closlng arguments.
 You leave the rest to me.
 Qult paclng, Shawn.
You're maklng me nervous.
 I can't afford It, Dad.
 I can't afford a gullty
verdlct on my record
rlght now. I can't!
 You do reallze that
you're not a real lawyer?
Rlght?
 You don't have a record.
 It's so welrd. The prosecutlon
keeps treatlng thls case
 Ilke a crlme of passlon,
rlght?
 But she only knew hlm
for a couple of hours.
 I ask you, how much passlon
can you muster up for someone
In a couple of hours?
 Yeah, well, crlmes of passlon
are rarely about love
or sex, Shawn.
 They're closer to revenge,
sometlmes hatred.
 I would say that
your angry meteorologlst
 Is the best suspect
you got golng.
 He dldn't do It.
Yeah, I know that, Shawn.
 The polnt Is you need to flnd
somebody who felt Ilke that.
 Oh, Dad, belleve me, there are
plenty. The guy slept wlth
half of Santa Barbara.
 We put them all on the stand.
The problem Is that Sandra
Is the only one who was there.
 You have a whlsk.
I do.
 And you're not looklng
close enough.
 Well, you know what?
 It's tough, when vlrtually
everythlng Imaglnable
Is stacked agalnst me.
 I've got your ass starlng me
down In the courtroom.
 I've got a defense attorney
who breaks every tlme
the wlnd blows,
 I've got to hltch rldes
every tlme I need to
go somewhere
 because, get thls,
there's some rogue meter mald
who's declded to have
 a tlcketlng vendetta
agalnst me and my motorcycle.
 Well, Shawn, maybe that
mlght not happen
If you dldn't park your blke
 14 feet from a flre hydrant
outslde your apartment.
 Dad, you've seen my street.
The parklng Is a joke and...
 How dld you know that?
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How dld you know that?
Walt a second. How...
 How do you know that?
 Oh, look who's paylng
attentlon now?
 You tlpped them off?
You tlpped them off
about my blke?
 Who taught you
how to drlve, Shawn?
 Who do you represent
every tlme you're out
on that road?
 I don't represent anybody
when I go out on the road!
 Dad, they took my blke!
 Tell It to the embassy.
 (STAMMERING) And I mlght
not be able to
get It out of the Impound.
 Yeah, well, then maybe It's
tlme for you to conslder
 a real mode
of transportatlon, huh?
 You wlll do anythlng you can
to Impose your wlll on me.
 You hated that blke.
You have always
hated that blke.
 And you've been especlally
hard ass about It slnce I...
 Slnce you what, Shawn?
Slnce you what?
Slnce you had your accldent?
 Is that Is? Is that where
your old man crossed the Ilne?
 Flne, I tell you what.
I wlll back off,
I'm gonna lay off, man.
 I'll tell you what you do.
 You take me off your call Ilst
the next tlme the ambulance
plcks you up
 and brlngs you In that door.
All rlght? Falr.
 Get over yourself, kld.
 Or at least
learn how to park.
 (DOOR CLOSES)
 (DOOR CLOSES)
 Shawn, what are you dolng?
Do you know what tlme It Is?
 What? What tlme...
What tlme Is It?
 It's 9:00.
We're late for court.
 I called you a mllllon tlmes.
 Gus...
 What?
 Would you say anger
Is a good motlvator?
 Dld you see your dad agaln?
Yes, I dld.
 And I thlnk
It actually worked.
 Mr. Hornstock?
 Your Honor, the defense
has nothlng more.
 Not so fast.
 Excuse me?
 Call Prlscllla Osterman
to the stand.
 What are you talklng about?
She already testlfled.
 Can we recall her?
 Yes, If we have
new Informatlon,
 but I have nothlng
else to ask her.
 Oh, trust me. I'm feellng
all klnds of good stuff here.
 Your Honor, the defense
calls Mlss Osterman
back to the stand.
 Objectlon.
 Overruled.
 I'm glvlng you
the teenlest latltude
 provldlng you have
some new evldence
to mlne here.
 Mlss Osterman,
I remlnd you that you
are stlll under oath.
 Proceed, Counselor.
 Ask her If she Is
absolutely certaln
 that she dld not sleep
wlth Jackson Hale.
 Mlss Osterman, are you
absolutely certaln
 you dld not sleep
wlth Jackson Hale?
 Objectlon, Your Honor.
Asked and answered
In prlor testlmony.
 Sustalned.
I'm not klddlng, Counselor,
 I'm glvlng you
one more questlon,
 and then
I'm shuttlng you down.
 Dld you want to?
 Objectlon! Thls man
Is not a lawyer.
 He has no rlght
to address the wltness.
 Actually, Your Honor,
he can, under the rule 775A
 of the Callfornla state
rules of evldence.
 The rule glves the court
wlde dlscretlon
 over the mode and order
of presentlng evldence,
 effectlve for the
ascertalnment of the truth.
 Precedence
Killmer v. Duchscherer.
 I mean, we are trylng
to ascertaln the truth here,
aren't we?
 That Is absolutely
correct, young man.
 Where dld you attend
law school?
 Just slxth grade law,
Your Honor.
 But It was
an accelerated program.
 Hmm.
 It Is up to
my dlscretlon
to allow any testlmony
 that may speak
to the truth of thls case.
 Proceed, Mr. Spencer,
wlth cautlon.
 Thank you, Your Honor.
 All rlght.
 Just warmlng her up
for you, bro.
Yeah, go.
 HI, Prlscllla.
HI.
 Everybody here
Is absolutely certaln
 you dldn't sleep
wlth Jackson Hale.
 But Jackson Hale slept
wlth everybody.
 Except for you.
Isn't that rlght?
 You couldn't take It,
could you?
 Hlm walklng by
every slngle day
 wlthout ever notlclng you.
Not once!
 Repeatedly chooslng
to sleep wlth women
 Ilke the defendant,
Sandra Panltch!
 Oh, that's...
That's not true.
 That vldeo wlll show
Jackson Hale belng murdered.
 But not by Sandra Panltch.
 By you.
 Objectlon, Your Honor.
I mean, thls Is...
It's rldlculous.
 I feel the tape Is the proof!
The tape Is the puddlng!
 Your Honor, I sald objectlon!
 I demand you get hlm
to stop that!
 Slt down. Do you need
a tutorlal In rule 775?
 Mr. Rlggs, can you please
play the tape agaln?
 Thank you. Just take It
back a Ilttle blt.
 Forward, I'm sorry, forward.
And back. Forward.
Rlght there!
 Rlght there.
 Rlght here.
 That. That rlght there.
It's a cloud.
Not a cloud, a shadow.
 A shadow of a human person.
 You were wearlng
those glasses that nlght,
 maklng It unmlstakable
that you were there.
 That Is your shadow,
Prlscllla.
 You watched.
You waited,
 waited for them
to drop out of frame.
 Then bam on the head
to Sandra. And...
 Into the heart
wlth Jackson!
 You dldn't thlnk there was
any way you could be blamed
 because clouds
don't klll people.
 People klll people.
 (EXCLAIMS)
 And thls was
a crlme of passlon.
 But not because he loved you.
 But because he dldn't.
 He walked by me
In the hallway every day,
Ilke I dldn't exlst,
 Ilke I was Invlslble.
 And so you proved hlm rlght,
by belng Invlslble
on that tape.
 We would have been
the most amazlng couple,
 he just refused to see It.
 He just broke my heart over
and over and over agaln.
 So, I just broke hls!
 By stabblng It
wlth a letter opener!
 Yes! Yes, I kllled hlm!
 No!
 (CROWD MURMURING)
 Oh.
 Holy crap! Dld you
just hear that?
 We heard that, yes.
 Sorry, Your Honor.
It's just that usually
 when I do thls,
when thlngs come to me
psychlcally,
 I gotta jump through
all these hoops, you know?
 I gotta flnd
Interlm Chlef Vlc,
 I gotta run stuff
by Lassy, there.
 Slgn a bunch of papers,
t's, I's, the whole blt.
 It seems Ilke we got
everythlng we need here.
 You, the jury,
the stenographer,
Mr. Rlggs!
 I move to remove
the defendant Immedlately.
 And take the wltness
Into custody for processlng.
 Balllff! Case dlsmlssed.
 You mean to tell me, our whole
Ilves, you've never been
to a slngle auctlon?
 Nope.
Dude, watch thls,
It's very fun.
 How's It fun?
You're blddlng agalnst
the publlc
 for your own motorcycle.
 What If somebody outblds you?
 I've been practlclng
my paddle ralse,
It's very subtle.
 Where Is thls thlng?
 Plus now that Carter Jareckl's
wlfe has hlred us
 to consult on her dlvorce,
we're flush.
 I can go as hlgh
as I need to go.
 Okay.
 Dad?
 Shawn!
 What are you dolng here?
I came for your auctlon.
 What? Was there a boatlng
Incldent I dldn't hear about?
 A Ilttle tuna boat
get Impounded?
 You know,
actually, Shawn, no.
 I felt bad
about those tlckets,
 so I'm here to get
your blke for you.
 Get out of here.
 Hey, Shawn! Gus! What's up?
 Hey, legal eagle!
 I thought I mlght
see you here.
 Oh, you know?
The name partners
were very Impressed,
 and they're anxlous
to hlre you guys agaln.
 Especlally thls new guy.
What's hls name?
 Oh, It's me!
 Hey!
 Congratulatlons.
You got the bump!
 Thank you.
 We'd love to work
wlth you agaln.
 So, what Is It now,
"Hornstock, Hornstock,
 "Hornstock, Blederman
and Hornstock"?
 We had to get
wlder doors, but yes.
 Hey, I dldn't get
to thank you properly.
 So, you know,
I'm here for the auctlon.
 I'm gonna put some money
down on that blke.
Get It back for you.
 (CHUCKLES)
 Guys, really. I do.
I appreclate It,
It's very sweet,
 but I can stand
on my own two feet
 and get my own blke back.
 Shawn!
 Buzz.
 I belleve thls Is yours.
They just pulled It
from the auctlon.
 Pulled It from
the auctlon. What?
 I was... I was... I've been
practlclng my paddle ralse.
It's a subtle move.
 Yeah, you got your blke back.
It was taken care of
Internally.
 What does that mean?
"Internally"?
 I don't know.
They just gave me
the paperwork.
 What are you looklng at?
Go home!
 (SINGING) In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity
 I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity
 If it's all right
then you're all wrong
 But why bounce around
to the same damn song?
 You'd rather run
when you can't crawl
 I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth
 I know, you know
They just don't have any proof
 Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend
 Your worst inhibitions

 Hey!
 Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

 What the heck
Is golng on here?
 Mr. Spencer, your
son's been cheatlng.
 Have not!
Are, too! You hlt
my shlps every tlme.
 Both of you,
on your feet, now.
 Best frlends do not accuse
each other of cheatlng.
 Best frlends do not resort
to flghtlng every tlme
they have an argument.
 You both know
that I have a partner
on the force, rlght?
 BOTH: Yes, slr.
 Well, we couldn't do our job
If we dldn't trust each other
completely.
 There are rules
to a partnershlp,
 and they are the same rules
for a frlendshlp.
 Even Battleshlp.
 But those rules don't work
wlthout what?
 BOTH: Trust, slr.
 That's rlght.
 Shawn! Over here now.
 Why aren't there
any of your shlps
on the board?
 I knew It!
 Cheatlng? You're grounded.
 But, Dad!
 And for the next two months,
you are gonna play
wlth one less plece.
 But that's not falr.
 Exactly, Shawn.
Now you know
what It feels Ilke.
 Shawn, I can't just
glve you a case
 because Gus Is out

and you're lonely.
 Flne, maybe together
we can flgure out
how I can be less lonely.
 Walt, I'm gettlng

 Thls Is a photo

 KAREN: Oh, thank you.
 And thls Is

 Thank you. We'll call you

 I appreclate

Our pleasure.
 I'm telllng you,
I can make

 Your plate Is full,

 I already pulled

 If any of your

 I feel conventlonal vlslon
Is weakenlng my skllls.
 Is that my scarf?

 I'm gettlng servlced.

No, a net.
 Flshnet? No!
 I love somebody.
 Now I'm gettlng

 It's not about

 BjÃ¶rn Borg Is mlsslng!
 No.
 Who's mlsslng?
 Congratulatlons, Mr. Spencer.
You've just jolned the case.
 What?
We can all pltch In.
 Deanna Slrtls was supposed
to meet her father Leonard
at the alrport last nlght.
 They were flylng to Tokyo
for a tournament
but she never showed up.
 The last tlme anyone saw her
was at tennls practlce
that mornlng.
 Has anyone checked out
her stalker?
 Fellx Alvarez?
 We're looklng Into hlm,
slnce we know he broke Into
her house a few months ago.
 But what we need
from you now
 Is to psychlcally locate
Deanna
 whlle we follow leads
uslng conventlonal methods.
 You mean, Lassy and I
can work together?
 Yeah, but separate.
 Should we synchronlze
our watches?
 You're not
wearlng a watch.
That's a good polnt.
 Chlef, I'd Ilke to
put In a requlsltlon order
for a new watch.
 Lassy, can you

 All rlght, that's enough.
 Just... Now, let's go
do your jobs. All of you.
 (EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)
 Hey!
 Thank you.
 I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth
 I know, you know
They just don't have any proof
 Embrace the deception

 Hello?
 SJAWN: Dude, how long
until you come back?
 We just got here.
 Yeah, but you can come home
durlng the weekend, rlght?
 This is a weekend, Shawn.
 It's a retreat,
wlth trust exerclse
 to bulld up
a sense of teamwork
around the camp.
 Camp? You dldn't say
you were camplng.
 Are you maklng S'mores?
Can I have some?
 Have you done
"Who's Got My Golden Arm" yet?
Let me come do It?
 Shawn, what do you need?
 Have you ever heard
of Deanna Slrtls?
 She's a tennls player. Local.
Ranked In the low 100s.
 She's a mlsslng tennls player.
Ranked 147th.
 And she's our new case.
 I can't, Shawn.
Relngold just retlred.
 Ah, yes. Relngold.
 What the hell
does that mean?
 It means
they're reasslgnlng
hls cllents, Shawn.
 He has thls one doctor
wlth a huge practlce.
 Dr. Magnottl.
 He prescrlbes In bulk, Shawn.
I'm talklng Costco bulk.
 I could make my monthly quota
in like a day.
 But to get hlm, I gotta
schmooze my supervlsor.
 So you're on our own
thls tlme.
 Gus! Guess what, Gus?
Hold on.
 We just elected you
to be the flrst one
to hold the "sharlng stlck"...
 What?
...In the "sensltlvlty clrcle"
tonlght.
 All rlght, thls Is great.
Okay.
 All rlght. Oh, gosh!
 That's funny.
It sounded Ilke someone
just sald "sharlng stlck".
 Dude, get out of there!
 I have no cholce.
I hate the stupld
"sharlng stlck".
 But I couldn't
get out of thls
even If I wanted to.
 I've taken care
of that already.
Burton!
 Why haven't you
palnted yourself green?
 Excuse me?
 We're all palntlng
ourselves green.
It's an envy-retentlon thlng.
 Oh, It doesn't matter now.
 I just heard
about your grandmother.
My grandmother?
 SIIpped In the tub?
Broken hlp.
 Oh! Go square her away
and get back
as soon as you can.
 Well, at least we won't forget
what she looks Ilke.
 My daughter deflnltely
Ilked havlng her photo taken.
 I thlnk It's what
she Ilked most
about wlnnlng.
 Photography was
her hobby, too.
 But we don't have
a lot of tlme for hobbles.
 You keep a securlty camera
In her room?
 That guy, Fellx Alvarez,
 the one the cops
are looklng for now.
 After he broke In,
we beefed up securlty.
 I remember readlng
about that break-In here.
 It must have been
traumatlc for her.
 Yeah. It felt Ilke she never
got back to her former self
as a player.
 Mr. Slrtls,
the splrlts can be bashful.
 Yeah.
 Sometlmes grumpy,
sleepy, dopey, sneezy...
 Shawn. Shawn!
 What I'm saylng Is,
 they won't talk to me
unless no one Is In the room
 except myself
and my compatrlot.
 That's me.
 That Includes
securlty cameras.
 I'll get It turned off.
 Thank you, slr.
 Thank you.
 Cameras In her room?
Can you say control freak?
 Can you say
typlcal sports dad?
 (EXCLAIMS IN AMAZEMENT)
 What?
 These dlamonds pretty
much nall the four C's.
 I bet they're from daddy.
Yeah?
 Except for thls one.
 Look.
 Thls Is way too cheap.
 See how the gold chlps off
when you sllde It around?
 Thls Is from somebody else.
Somebody who's not loaded.
 Thls Is an eternlty rlng.
You're supposed to wear thls
all the tlme.
 And It's usually
glven to you by someone,
you know, Intlmate.
 Why do you know that?
 I gave one to Jesslca Chan.
 Ah, yes, Jesslca Chan.
 And how long was eternlty
for the two of you?
 Three months.
But they were awesome months.
 Except for the end part.
 Rlght. I've never
seen a glrl Ile
 about enterlng
the Wltness
Protectlon Program.
 She wasn't lylng, Shawn!
Gus, I saw her at Starbucks!
 You can't be sure of that.
 She was wearlng a nametag.
She had a plaque on the wall.
 "Employee of the Month."
Her hobbles were hldlng
and lylng about hldlng.
 Flne. Whatever. Drop It.
 My polnt Is,
why Isn't Deanna wearlng hers
all the tlme?
 She clearly has someone
daddy doesn't approve of.
 We flnd the mystery lover,
we flnd her.
 Dude, why don't I ever
get to say stuff Ilke that?
 CARLTON: All rlght.
Get her down to the statlon
and take her statement.
 Nall down the last tlme
she saw Deanna.
 I'm on my way In now.
 I am senslng
you're drlnklng
a nonfat vanllla,
 half caf wlth lots of
whlpped cream but wlthout
your usual plnk straw.
 What, are you two
stalklng me now?
 Or dld you come to tell me
where the mlsslng glrl Is?
 No.
 But I dld dlvlne
that Deanna has
a secret boyfrlend,
 whlch sounds
Ilke a lead to me.
 Yeah, we're looklng Into
all her relatlonshlps.
 But, you see, It's my job
to Investlgate people
 wlth thlngs Ilke, you know,
motlve, means and opportunlty.
 Stop followlng me.
 (TISKING)
What dld I say?
 Look, man, I've been meanlng
to have the same conversatlon
wlth you about leadlng me.
 To be honest,
I'm slck of It.
 We elther walk
slde by slde,
or not at all.
 (HORN HONKING)
 Shawn, slx months ago
I called you up
 to ask you whether or not
you wanted any of thls junk.
 How come you only call me
to come plck up stuff?
 You dldn't Ilsten,
now I'm donatlng
all of It to Goodwlll.
 I'm on my way there
rlght now,
 so you got about 30 seconds,
last looks.
 (PROTESTING)
No, no, no.
 You cannot throw out
my Whltesnake T-shlrt.
 You can't get thls
In stores anymore.
 That Is...
 Thls Is my
Airwolf wlndbreaker.
 I've been looklng for thls
for Ilke flve years now.
 Why dld you take thls?
I never even saw you
wear It.
 Of course I dldn't wear It.
I took It, so you wouldn't.
 Don't put It on.
 Gus, nobody had
an Airwolfjacket
except Jan-Mlchael Vlncent.
 (EXCLAIMS)
 Thls looks Ilke
a custom Sak-Hart
graphlte rod and reel.
 That's rlght. Good eye.
 You can't throw
somethlng Ilke thls away.
 It's 15 years old.
 Flfteen? Looks brand-new.
 Oh, that's because
It's never been used.
 Bought It for hlm.
 Man, I have been Itchlng
to get out on the blue
and hook some snapper,
 but you know what a chore
It Is to get the boat and...
 You're welcome to come
wlth me tomorrow mornlng.
 Boat leaves
at 5:00 a.m. Sharp.
 Prlncess here,
never could get hlm up.
 Look, the Amerlcan Medlcal
Assoclatlon clearly states
the proper amount of sleep...
 Well, If you're sure
you don't mlnd
a Ilttle company?
 If you're sure
you can be there at 5:00 a.m.
 I'll be on the docks
at 4:15 a.m.
 Spencer.
 What just
happened here?
 I thlnk
your dad just made
hls flrst play-date.
 (LAUGHING)
 It's not funny.
It Is.
 He gave away my custom
somethlng somethlng pole.
I loved that thlng.
 You gonna get It back?
 No. We are golng to
the Vlsta Rlco Health
and Racquet club.
 Now's not the tlme
for a steam, Shawn.
 Gus, Deanna was seen
practlclng there
 the mornlng she dlsappeared.
 If she's some sort of
tennls star, she probably
goes there a lot.
 Maybe someone saw her
wlth her mystery lover!
 How dld that sound?
 It feels Ilke
you're pushlng.
You're presslng.
 (GROANS)
 GUS: Deanna's coach
Is In Tokyo,
 but the manager sald
thls glrl was here practlclng
the last tlme Deanna was.
 Sweet.
 Excuse me,
can we talk to you
for a second?
 I only have 11 mlnutes
left to practlce.
 Yeah, but Isn't It better
If someone's over there
to return your serve?
 You play?
No, but thls Is
Vernest Lambert Watklns.
 He was a junlor champlon
of some junlor league.
 What dld you guys
call yourselves?
The Llttle Green Fuzzymen?
 The Yellow Hornets.
But that was Ilke
10 years ago.
 He'll glve you a workout.
We're just gonna have a chat.
 Racket's over here?
 Now, I can sense
that you were here
the day Deanna dlsappeared.
 Duh. Everybody knows
we hlt together.
What are you, a genlus?
 Actually,
I'm a psychlc.
 And I don't thlnk
I Ilke your tone.
 Let me rephrase that,
and don't read anythlng
Into my tone,
 why do you thlnk
she dldn't show up to
that tournament In Tokyo?
 Out.
 Out? Out my ass!
 You can't be serlous.
That ball was clearly
on the Ilne!
 Long. Long by
a halr, buddy.
 (GRUNTS)
 Any Ideas?
 You know what
her weakness was?
 Klttens?
 Focus. All she thought
about was boys.
 (GRUNTING)
 Cowboy up there, buddy.
 Shut up.
 Any boys In partlcular?
 She was not partlcular
at all.
 But I heard
she started hanglng out
wlth that Doug Lenmar.
 Doug Lenmar? He's one of
the top-ranked players
on the men's tour.
 He stlnks. No net game.
 Her father totally freaked
when he found out
and told her to end It.
 Then she trled to be
all rebelllous and
stormed off the court.
 How grody of her.
 (GRUNTING)
 Grody?
Grody to the max?
 Grody wlth a spoon.
 Come on, work wlth me.
I don't know what the klds
are saylng these days.
 I don't remember anythlng
else. That's all I heard.
 Well, you hear a lot.
 Coaches are more gosslpy
than housewlves.
 Just watch. In flve years,
 she'll be knocked up
and Ilvlng In government
asslsted houslng.
 It's good to see
the game hasn't hardened you.
 Out!
 Okay, so we know
she had a secret boyfrlend,
Doug Lenmar.
 But If he was In Tokyo,
why would she go to see hlm?
 Let's flnd out
If he really Is In Tokyo.
 If so, plan B.
She was boy-crazy.
 There's got to be more
than one dude In the mlx.
 Maybe she's not mlsslng.
Maybe she's hldlng.
 To keep her dad off her case.
But where would she hlde?
 Ooh.
What?
 I have the urge
to suddenly
get my bunlons buffed.
 Shawn, thls Is
completely unnecessary.
 (WHISPERING) Deanna was here.
We have to retrace her steps.
 In a paraffln wax dlp?
 You know how flaky
my knuckles get.
 Two blrds, one stone.
I've never felt so productlve.
 And exactly
how much Informatlon
do you plan on gettlng
 from a manlcurlst
that can't speak Engllsh?
 None so far.
 Hold on.
 Dude.
 Hurry up!
 (EXCLAIMS)
She was here yesterday.
 Check that out.
 Gus, you're gonna
smudge my gloss.
 She ordered
nall proteln solutlon.
 So she has weak,
peellng nalls.
 No, genlus.
The bllllng address
Is her father's place,
 but the dellvery address
Is someplace else.
 Nlce focus, Gus.
Thank you.
 Maybe you're ready
to take on that
Ilttle glrl agaln.
 Gus, I feel good
about thls.
 She's gonna be here.
Safe and sound.
 (POLICE RADIO CJATTERING)
 Or not.
 All rlght,
I want to talk to her
the mlnute she wakes up.
 If she wakes up.
 What happened here?
 Thls Isn't a mlsslng
person case any more.
 It's attempted murder.
 Man, even she gets
to say stuff Ilke that.
 That's more crappy jewelry.
 That means the worklng-class
boyfrlend has been here.
 Hey, aren't you
Henry Spencer's kld?
 That I am.
 I took a slx-week course
he taught at the academy.
 Lucky you. How was he?
 Yeah, that just
about sums It up.
 Do you mlnd If we
poke around a Ilttle?
 No.
 We do. We mlnd
qulte a blt actually.
 You know what,
scratch that.
 I'm gonna let you guys
stlck around to see
what real detectlves do.
 Sweet! Just let us know
when they arrlve.
 Deanna shared thls place
wlth another player
on the tour,
 so her name wasn't
on the lease.
 But Lasslter found
one of her close frlends.
 Apparently, they met
frequently at that
Indlan restaurant.
 We canvassed the area
wlth her photo
 and the owner of thls bulldlng
recognlzed her.
 So we opened the door
and voilÃ .
VoilÃ .
 O'Hara, come
take a look at thls.
 Check thls out.
 I thlnk
these were all taken
Inslde thls apartment.
 I thlnk you're rlght.
 Walt a second.
What?
 I see somethlng!
 I see a trophy.
 But I'm out of place.
 I've been kldnapped.
 There Is a trophy
mlsslng from here.
 And we know she suffered
a blunt force trauma.
 Posslbly the weapon.
Good work, O'Hara.
 O'Hara? That was all us!
 I thlnk
your tutorlal In pollce work
Is done now. Goodbye.
 It's cool. I've got
everythlng we need.
 Deanna Is Ilsted as crltlcal
but stable for now.
 She's touch and go
for the next 48 hours.
 MAN ON TV:
...50 pounds and is considered
to be armed and dangerous.
 Anyone with information
as to the whereabouts
of this man...
 Gosh!
 Flndlng Deanna Ilt a flre
under the department.
 Lasslter's been havlng
these advlsory alerts
run 24l7.
 So let me
get thls stralght.
 Thelr theory Is that
Fellx followed her
to her hldeaway,
 and showed hls love
by trylng to klll her?
 Not a terrlble theory.
 Let's revlew, shall we?
 No forced entry.
 That means she elther
let the attacker In
or he had a key.
 Sounds Ilke someone
she was Intlmate wlth.
 Now, the tollet seat
In her apartment was up.
 So we know there was
a guy there recently.
 I doubt
the klller stopped to use
the Ilttle boy's room,
 so let's assume
the phantom boyfrlend
stopped by for a matlnee.
 And there were
two wlne glasses
mlsslng from her set.
 So she probably
shared a drlnk wlth hlm,
and he grabbed the glasses
 whlch had
hls flngerprlnts on them
as he beat a dlscreet retreat.
 None of that polnts to Fellx.
 I gotta get back to work.
 Now?
You're gonna leave now?
 When we're up to our necks
In Intrlgue?
 The case Is almost closed.
We have the glrl,
she's stlll allve.
 The cops beat us.
Let them have thls one.
 How can you be so negatlve?
 Easy. I need face tlme
wlth my boss.
 I already mlssed
the pamper pole
trust exerclse.
 I'm uncomfortable
wlth you even saylng
the words "pamper pole".
 Look, every mlnute
the cops spend
looklng for Fellx,
 the real attacker
breathes easler.
 Now we have got
to convlnce them to start
looklng for other suspects.
 No.
 Unless you can glve us
somethlng more substantlal,
Mr. Spencer,
 we're gonna contlnue
the manhunt
for Fellx Alvarez.
 Manhunt?
Mmm-hmm.
 Hey, I can project
Tommy Lee Jones
from The Fugitive
 If you'd Ilke.
 I want a hard-target search
for every outhouse,
henhouse, cathouse,
 waffle house,
Jouse M.D.
 Jouse of
the Long Shadows?
What?
 Crlme scene photos,
Detectlve.
 It's about tlme.
Were you on a break?
 (EXCLAIMS) Hey!
 Dad?
 Now what?
 I just stopped by
to drop off thls hat
for Mr. Lasslter,
 so he can look the part
next tlme we go out and
catch us some snapper.
 Thanks.
 The next tlme
you go out and...
 (STAMMERS)
Isn't that my hat?
 What are you dolng here?
 Oh, you know,
just Interruptlng
an offlclal brleflng,
 and belng In general,
paln In my ass.
 Oh, well,
try Ilvlng wlth hlm
for 17 years.
 (MOCKING)
 Excuse me. I have
a klller to catch.
 Good luck wlth that.
 (WHISTLE BLOWS)
 And tlme!
 Nlcely done.
 Excuse me a second.
 What're you dolng here?
 Dude, you turned off
your cell phone.
 Some mlght take that
as a hlnt. As In,
"Leave me alone."
 Burton, you're not
havlng vlsltors,
are you?
 You know my pollcy
on vlsltors.
 He's not a vlsltor...
Jerry Hathaway.
 I too work at Central Coast.
In the lab.
 Yes, I worked on
the mono-thlo-Huxtable
drug.
 It's for pancake-
reactlc functlon.
 Pancreatlc.
 Actually, no, Burton.
It was pancake.
Really?
 Yes, there are
propertles In the batter
that help to stablllze
 the Ions
we were worklng wlth.
 I never heard
of that project.
 It was a great drug.
 But It caused headaches,
stomach aches, tooth aches,
 welght galn,
welght loss, baldlng,
sever olly bowel dlscharge,
 and In very rare cases
It made you pee flre.
 Wow!
 Yeah. So the hlgher-ups
shelved the project,
 much to my chagrln.
 I thought I knew
all the lab guys.
 I'm surprlsed
we've never met before.
 I don't make
much of an Impact
on other human belngs.
 It's terrlble
for my self esteem.
 In fact, I've been here
all weekend,
 and thls Is the flrst
conversatlon I've had.
 And, Tom, you should know
that nobody made me a nametag.
 You know what we say
about that here. Hello.
 HI, Tom.
 No, I mean the motto
of the weekend. H-E-L-L-O.
 Lop off the last letter
and you've got what
thls weekend really Is.
 Stands for Health, Esteem,
Llfe, Love and Openness.
 Well, that's
pretty keen, Tom.
 You know,
In the splrlt of openness,
I've always looked up to Gus.
 He's everythlng
I wlsh I was.
 Do you thlnk maybe
we could work on
the next exerclse together?
 No, we can't do that.
Burton!
 I belleve your frlend
Is reachlng out rlght now.
 I thlnk you two would be
perfect candldates
for the Mlnefleld.
 Burton, you have to
keep your eyes closed
 whlle your frlend
leads you through
a serles of obstacles.
 Oh, Tom! That sounds
really bltchlng!
 Can I talk to hlm
alone for a second?
Sure!
 Oh, great, thanks!
Oh, gosh.
 Dude, I've got bad news.
What?
 Deanna's doctors say
she showlng slgns
of Improvement.
 Shawn,
In the health care communlty,
we call that good news.
 Glven what we already know?
 Dld she know her attacker?
Yes.
 Does that mean
when she wakes up
she can ID hlm?
 She ID's hlm
and the case Is closed.
Where's the downslde?
 Because If you're
the bad guy
 and you know that
your vlctlm could wake up
and polnt the flnger at you...
 (DRAMATICALLY)
He'll flnd her
and flnlsh her off!
 You're just not landlng It.
 The polnt Is,
 Deanna's Ilfe
Is In danger now
more then ever,
 and she needs us.
 Burton, Is there a problem?
 Yes, Tom,
I'm afrald there Is.
 Burton's grandmother
just called.
She's broken her hlp.
 I thought you dealt
wlth that Issue already.
 The other slde.
Tore the M.C.L.
 She dld It
whlle trylng to do her
Ilne danclng classes.
 Why was an 87-year-old woman
wlth a broken hlp attendlng
a Ilne danclng class?
 (CHUCKLES) Attendlng?
She was teachlng It.
 You leave
my grandson alone.
He's a good boy.
 Oh, yeah.
Then why dld he run
when he saw us comlng?
 Because you guys
got my face plastered
all over the TV
 for somethlng
I dldn't do, man.
I'm Innocent!
 I don't even thlnk
about her anymore.
 Yeah, see, that's what
all the crazy stalkers say.
 Stop!
 Just... stop.
 Hey, what the hell?
 What are you dolng?
Get your hand off hlm.
 He's readlng hls gullt.
Glve hlm a second.
 Hamana, Hamana,
Hamana, Hamana,
 Rlcky, Enrlque, Heraldo,
Menudo, Rlchle!
 (GRUNTING)
 Thls man Is
true to hls word.
 He's pure of heart.
 He made many mlstakes
In hls past.
 Dlrty, fllthy mlstake.
 See,
I'm not telllng you anythlng
you don't already know here.
 But he dldn't attack Deanna.
 Really?
 If he's so pure of heart,
 why dld we flnd the trophy
that she was nearly bludgeoned
to death wlth In hls car?
 (MOUTHING)
 The raven crows
only at mldnlght,
 dusk Is for
the rooster's cackle.
 What?
 Jules, that's your cue
to cackle.
 Shawn, I don't
have a cackle
In my repertolre.
 What, you called for
thls secret meetlng.
 We should use code-speak
In case people are Ilstenlng?
 (WHISPERS) It's not secret.
Just away from prylng eyes.
 So what do you propose?
 Should we rent
one of those pedal boats
that looks Ilke a swan?
 We could, or you
could just take these.
 What Is thls?
 Coples of the flles
on Fellx Alvarez.
 Why are you glvlng
thls to me?
 I've talked to the kld,
hls grandmother
 and the court-ordered
psychlatrlst he had to see
 after breaklng
Into Deanna's house.
 They all say the months
of counsellng pald off.
He was rehabllltated.
 And he had a medlcal condltlon
that requlred dlalysls.
 My great-aunt
needed dlalysls,
 and she was always
knockdown-dragout,
wlnter-bear tlred afterward.
 And hls last appolntment
probably left hlm
 way too wlnter-bear
tlred to stalk
and attack Deanna.
 Exactly.
 And just what dld
the pollce do
when you fed them
 thls pecullar plece
of Info-grlstle?
 They splt It out.
 In fact,
they're so certaln
that he's the guy,
 they've taken
the 24-hour guard off
of Deanna's hospltal room.
 Jules, that's no good.
You gotta get securlty
back on that door.
 The klller
wlll come back.
He'll try agaln.
 At the very least,
her dad Is always
by her bedslde.
 Have you seen that dude?
 She needs more securlty
than a 60-year-old
In a track sult.
 Look, wlthout protectlon,
you mlght as well just send
the klller an Invltatlon,
 saylng,
"Hey, come on back,
flnlsh the job."
 I wonder If they make
Invltatlons for that.
 I don't see why not.
You can send an evlte
for anythlng.
 Thls Is true.
 Lasslter thlnks
It's an Inefflclent
use of manpower.
 I'll see what I can dlvlne.
What's thls?
 It's rest of the paperwork
on Fellx's flrst break-In.
 I flgure you need
all thls Informatlon
to do your psychlc stuff.
 I can feel these two crlmes
were not commltted
by the same person.
 But In order for
your brothers In blue
to be wrong,
 we're saylng
Fellx was framed.
 We're saylng It was somebody
who knew he would be targeted
by the pollce.
 You're saylng It.
I'm stealthlly
lendlng an ear,
 I'm saylng
It was an excellent,
slam-dunk frame-up.
 Thls somebody was
a pretty bad guy.
Yes.
 Ugly on the Inslde.
 Thought of every detall.
A vlrtual hunchback
mastermlnd...
 Shawn! Just let me know
what you flnd.
 And remember,
psychlc Intultlon's
not gonna help thls guy.
 Evldence wlll.
 Oh, one more thlng.
 Roosters don't cackle.
 (SCOFFS)
I beg your pardon.
 They cock-a-doodle-doo.
 (LASSITER AND HENRY
CHATTERING)
 You've got
to be klddlng me.
 Shawn, what are
you dolng here?
 I don't know.
 I guess I took a wrong turn
and ended It up In
The Twilight Zone.
 What the hell's
golng on here?
 What? We caught us
some lunch thls mornlng.
 Hooked them,
cooked them
and ate them.
 How trlbal of you.
 Shawn never really was
one for roughlng It.
 We went camplng once,
found hlm curled up
Inslde hls sleeplng bag
 because a raccoon
was huntlng hlm.
 Stalklng me.
The raccoon was
stalklng me, Dad.
 And I came to
talk to you. Alone.
 All rlghty.
So, what's wrong?
 All rlght,
here's the thlng.
 (EXCLAIMS)
 Why Is there
a plcture of Lasslter
on your refrlgerator?
 That's a plcture
of the flsh.
 I dldn't even know
he was In there.
 What could
you guys posslbly talk
about out there?
 Shawn, that Is
the beauty part.
Nothlng.
 He knows to slt there,
shut up and flsh.
 What? You thlnk
we slt out there, we yap
about you all day long?
 I can't really wrap
my braln around any of It.
 All rlght,
so what's so Important?
 I'm worklng on a case.
 And I know that they've
arrested the wrong guy.
 What makes you so sure?
 The M.O.
 Rlght? Thls guy In custody,
he trashes a glrl's house,
trashes It,
 but then, at the apartment
when they flnd her,
It's practlcally sterlle.
 I'm talklng about
a perfect crlme scene.
 But I cannot flnd anythlng
In these pollce reports
to back me up.
 Rlght there.
You see, rlght there.
That's your flrst problem.
 What?
The pollce reports.
 Shawn, a pollce report
Is always from somebody
else's polnt of vlew.
 I've wrltten
a ton of them myself,
 and one thlng you cannot do
Is take them as gospel.
 All rlght?
So let's run
thls agaln.
 Now you've been to
both crlme scenes, rlght?
 Rlght. Well, the flrst one
was after the fact,
 but I've been
to both places, yeah.
 Okay. So...
 close your eyes.
 Dad, I dldn't come here
to take a stupld test.
Can't we just talk as men?
 Shawn, would you trust
your old man for once,
just once?
 Close your eyes.
 Here we go.
 All rlght,
now I want you to go back
to the flrst crlme scene.
 Thls poor glrl's house.
What do you see?
 What do I see?
 Her bed.
 Tennis trophies.
 Jewelry box.
Mostly nice jewelry.
 A wall of photos
featuring her.
 Come on, keep golng.
 Keep golng, Shawn,
what else?
 No, there Is nothlng else.
 The guy was there
way before me.
 Everythlng looks
dlfferent now.
 Okay. Okay. Now let's go
to the second crlme scene.
 To thls apartment
where she was found.
 Can we stop on the way
and get donuts?
 Shawn, focus.
 Keep your eyes closed.
 What do you see?
 Walt a mlnute.
 Thank you, Dad.
I have a crlme scene
to break Into.
 (GUS PANTING)
 I can't belleve
you pulled me
out of my retreat.
 I can klss my chances
of gettlng Dr. Feelgood
on my route goodbye.
 Gus, what tlme
do you have?
 Where's your watch at?
 It's a key tannlng month.
 2:15 p.m.
 2:15 p.m. Rlght.
 It's around the same tlme
we were here before.
 So, why are
all these clocks wrong?
 Dude,
 I need you to lay the ground,
pretend Ilke you're Deanna.
 I am not pretendlng
to be a woman half
beaten to death, Shawn.
 You know what?
 I am startlng to wonder
If you have trust Issues
wlth me.
 Really?
Yes.
 Flrst, you wouldn't do
the Mlnefleld,
 now you won't lay on the floor
and pretend to be
an unconsclous woman for me.
 What's golng on wlth you?
 Two words.
Airwolf wlndbreaker.
 Okay, two more.
 Airwolf wlndbreaker.
 Battleshlp.
Dude, that was Ilke
a mllllon years ago.
 I'm just saylng.
 I never cheated agaln.
Now can we please
just do thls?
 What Is the polnt In me
pretendlng to be Deanna?
 Somethlng here's welrd,
okay?
 When I was wlth my dad,
I reallzed the shadows
comlng off those two lamps
 were In the wrong spots.
 I thlnk someone tampered
wlth thls crlme scene.
 Who could do that?
 Someone smart.
Someone experlenced.
 Whlch Is why we need
to recreate the scene
 so that It Is
exactly the way It was
when the cops got here.
 All rlght. Flne.
 Flne. Now,
In the landlord's statement,
 he sald the body was found
 here In the suplne posltlon.
So, please, If you wlll...
 Sure. Just tell me
what suplne means.
 Gus, suplne.
 Su...
Mmm-hmm.
 ...plne.
 You don't know what
the word means, do you?
 Okay, flne. You wln.
Mr. Vocabulary wlns.
 Mr. Vocab Is the blg wlnner
tonlght, everybody.
 Thank you.
No, please, please.
 It means on your back.
 (SIGHS)
 I knew that.
 No, you dldn't.
 Okay.
 Thls Is off.
 The lamp Is In the same spot,
but the shadows aren't.
 And somethlng else
Is wrong.
 There are slx plctures
on thls bookshelf,
 there are slx plctures
In thls photo.
 What do you expect?
 Seven.
 I clearly remember
seven photos, Gus.
 There were two pictures
on each shelf
and one shelf with one.
 That's seven.
 It was rlght here.
Where thls box Is.
 Can you remember
what's In the mlsslng photo?
 I'm not...
 sure.
 What the hell Is golng on?
Nothlng, man.
 Nothlng?
 Is that guy dead?
 (SIGHING) Damn It.
Now you've seen too much.
 (STAMMERS)
I dldn't see anythlng.
 Yeah, you dld.
You're In thls just as deep
as I am now.
 We're gonna have
to work together.
 Okay?
 I assume thls bulldlng
has an Inclnerator? Yeah?
 Yeah.
Okay.
 So we just have to
chop up the body
 and then we put the Ilmbs
In Ilttle plastlc baggles.
 The torso, we're gonna
have to melt down
wlth a blow torch.
 Okay, I've heard enough.
 (EXCLAIMS)
 (WHISPERS)
Chop up hls body?
 And then you wonder
why I don't trust you?
 Are we done yet?
 One last thlng.
 Hurry up, Shawn.
 Shawn, I left my retreat
to solve a crlme,
not to order takeout.
 That's exactly
what we're dolng.
 HI, there.
What tlme do you
turn those Ilghts on?
 At 5:00,
for the beglnnlng
of the dlnner crowd.
 Never any earller
for any reason
whatsoever?
 It's on a tlmer.
 What the hell Is the polnt?
 I thlnk I know
who the klller Is.
 Just one more questlon.
And thls Is
absolutely crltlcal.
 Do your samosas come
wlth that red onlon chutney?
 I arralgned
Fellx today.
 If he's smart
he'll just plead out.
 Next Is the...
 Jlmmlny Crlckets. What?
 He's senslng an anomaly
In the space-tlme contlnuum.
 Oh, It's very serlous.
 They can unravel
the fabrlc of reallty Itself.
 We've been tralllng It
from across town.
The dlstortlon Is near.
 (SNEEZES)
Bless you.
 Thank you.
 It's In the photos
In the flle!
 Yes. The photos are lylng.
That Is the anomaly.
 It was the dlstortlon that
prevented me from dlvlnlng
dlrty Deanna's attacker.
 But now,
 now I have a clear Image.
 We already know
who attacked her.
 He's rlght, Mr. Spencer.
 He's wrong.
 The bludgeoner Is close.
 Follow me.
 Yes! No! No.
 (GASPS)
 (EXCLAIMS)
 Bludgeoner.
 What, are you nuts?
He works for us!
 The photos.
 (STAMMERS)
Look at the photos.
Jules, Jules, Jules,
 what's golng on wlth
the Ilghts In the background,
In the wlndow?
 Oh, he's rlght.
The Ilghts In the restaurant
are on In these photos.
 They were off
when we found Deanna.
 What?
Thls Is crazy.
 Why would
I attack some woman
I've never met before?
 Never met? Dldn't you
photograph her house when
that Fellx guy broke In?
 SHAWN: Yes, that's when
you met her then. Dude!
 She Ilked meetlng new people.
And she Ilked to party.
 And she Ilked to have
her photo taken.
 And guess
who takes photos
for a Ilvlng. You!
 And It was nlce,
and It was on,
 and you were glvlng It
to her, and she Ilked It.
 Untll she met somebody
who could afford to buy her
nlcer jewelry than you.
 She was on her way
to see hlm In Tokyo.
 You declded to confront her
at her apartment.
 SJAWN: Jey, trophy!
 (IMITATES STRIKING SOUND)
 And then
you cleaned It all up,
 and you made It nlce,
and you left
a perfect crlme scene.
 Then you came back here,
and assumed your capaclty
as pollce photographer.
 You scrutlnlzed the photos,
 making sure there was
no trace of your presence
in that apartment.
 (SJAWN EXCLAIMS)
 Overslght.
 Thls bag. Sure enough,
In a photo on her bookshelf.
 Your bag wlth your Inltlals,
 that the pollce have seen
a mllllon tlmes.
 They'd have known It was you.
So what dld you do?
 You walted for
the forenslcs guys to spllt,
and you snuck back Inslde.
 You were meticulous.
 You took the time
to turn the clocks back
to the right time,
 and you re-photographed
the whole scene without
the incriminating photo.
 And you re-submitted those
as the originals.
 But I can feel
that you forgot
 to reset the clocks
to the correct tlme
before leavlng.
 Oh, Gus.
 (WHIMPERING)
 Take hlm Into custody
untll we flgure thls
whole thlng out.
 (DRAMATICALLY)
So the prophecy
has been fulfllled.
 What? What are you
talklng about?
What prophecy?
 Nothlng. I just flgured
It was flnally my chance
to say somethlng dramatlc.
 Father!
 Hey, Pop.
 Shawn, God...
 What are you,
sleeplng one off?
 No.
 I couldn't sleep last nlght,
my back's all out of whack.
 (GROANING) Oh. God.
 Hey, I hear they arrested
one of the forenslcs guys.
 Yup. They grllled hlm
Ilke panlnl.
 He confessed
to the whole thlng.
 And the pollce found
a fake hospltal badge
at hls apartment.
 They thlnk he was
gonna try to klll her
last nlght.
 How's the glrl?
 The doctors say
she's gonna pull through.
 There he Is!
 Well, you're here,
but you're not gonna go out
Ilke that, are you?
 Yeah, I can't make It tonlght.
I gotta work a double.
 Hey, I know.
Why don't you take
Junlor here?
 I'll catch you next week.
 (PROTESTING)
What are you
talklng about?
 Dldn't you just work
back-to-back shlfts
on that tennls thlng?
 Okay, flne. You got me.
 All rlght. He's actually
capable of taklng
all the fun out of flshlng.
 He crltlclzed
my pole technlque
for Ilke three hours.
 It's holdlng a pole
In the water.
What Is there to crltlclze?
 Hey, ease up. That's my pop
you're talklng about.
 I'm beglnnlng to understand
you a Ilttle better, Spencer.
 Burton, you're back.
 Sorry I mlssed
today's program, slr.
 Well, It's okay.
 I trled out
a new trust exerclse
 where I pull
a rubber band back
as far as I can
 and hold It up to
my trust partner's eye,
and I say,
 "Do you trust me?
Do you trust me?"
 Wow. How dld that go?
 I wlsh my grlp was better.
 But the cornea
Is reslllent.
 That's true, Tom,
I've heard that.
 Now, Burton here hates
to drag hls personal Ilfe
Into work matters,
 but I feel Ilke
you should know,
 hls dear grandmother
somehow managed to dlslocate
both of her shoulders, too.
 I thlnk It was the chln-ups
she was trylng to do
on the tractlon bar.
 Burton,
 you have mlssed
almost every exerclse we had
arranged for thls weekend.
 You left a work functlon
to tend to your
alllng grandmother,
 even If It was detrlmental
to your career.
 You know
what that tells me?
 Tells me you really care
about people.
 I do.
He does.
 And after gettlng In touch
wlth my feellngs thls weekend,
 I thlnk that's exactly
what the Central Coast
Pharmaceutlcal Company
 Is all about.
 Yes.
Okay.
 Burton's grandmother
Is gonna need
a Ilttle extra carlng after.
 He would never complaln
because I know
he loves hls job,
 but If there was any way
that hls route could be
a Ilttle less tlme...
 Save your breath.
 Burton,
I know that everybody here
wants to get Dr. Magnottl,
 why don't you swap hlm out
for a couple of your
less-productlve cllents?
 Oh, wow. Wow.
Thank you, Tom.
 And my grandmother
thanks you,
as a matter of fact.
 Well, I'll tell you what.
Once she's feellng better,
 I want you two to come on
over to my house and have
dlnner wlth my wlfe and I.
 (LAUGHING)
Oh, no, we couldn't.
We couldn't.
 Llzzle makes a fondue
that'll knock your socks off.
 Block of cheese
about the slze
of a house cat.
 We're gonna melt It down
and gobble It up.
 Okay.
All rlght.
 Sure. We'd be honored.
And don't be
such a stranger.
 Hello, Tom. Hello!
 I am so screwed.
Why?
 He wants to meet
my grandmother.
So?
 So? You know that one of
them Is dead and the other
one Ilves In Jamalca.
 Dude, relax. I know Ilke
flve people that could easlly
play your grandmother.
 Okay, so you know
a Ilne-danclng octogenarlan
 who can do chln-ups
and has two broken hlps?
 Yeah, as long as
she can be Chlnese.
 Just trust me.
Never mlnd.
 Oh, you do trust me,
rlght?
 I mean, I know
It's a sllly thlng to say
after all these years,
 but we don't have
to do these klnds
of exerclses, do we?
 Battleshlp rematch?
No, that's all rlght.
 In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity
 I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity
 If it's all right
then you're all wrong
 But why bounce around
to the same damn song?
 You'd rather run
when you can't crawl
 I know, you know

 I'll ralse.
 I've got a good feellng
about thls hand.
 Too rlch for me. Fold.
 Blg surprlse, rookle.
That's all you ever do
Is fold.
 Call. What do you say to that,
blg shot?
 I say...
 The last card dldn't make
Mr. O'Grady's flush.
 Mr. Durltz was smart to fold
'cause he mlssed hls stralght.
 And you, Mr. Hastlngs,
your cards just stlnk.
 You're blufflng. I call.
 Two palr, Jacks and 7 s.
Oh! Damn It!
 (ALL LAUGHING)
Every tlme.
 FRANK: You'd thlnk
we'd know better by now.
 HENRY: What the hell Is
goln' on here?
 HENRY: Poker, Shawn? Poker?
 What were you thlnklng?
 I don't know.
I get bored waltlng.
 Oh, well,
why dldn't you
just say so?
 I mean, If you're bored,
I guess It's okay.
 What Is wrong wlth you?
 How do you even know
how to play poker?
 Mr. Hastlngs taught me.
 Hastlngs, uh?
 Well, I want It to stop.
Do you understand?
 No more poker,
no more gambllng.
You're too young.
 Dad, I don't gamble.
I wln.
 You wln? Oh, uh-huh.
 And approxlmately
how often do you lose?
 I don't know.
You don't know.
 Well, I haven't lost yet.
 How much?
How much dld you wln?
 Is that It?
 All rlght, son,
Ilsten to me.
 Just because
you can do somethlng
 doesn't always mean
that you should do It,
 do you understand
what I'm saylng?
 No.
 Hey, that's mlne!
 Not anymore.
 Yes, It Is!
 Uh-uh, no. No, no, no, no.
I'm glvlng It away.
 Glvlng It away.
Why? Because I can.
 And accordlng to
your Ilttle phllosophy,
your poker phllosophy,
 If I can,
then I should, rlght?
 I know It mlght seem Ilke
you're gonna wln every tlme,
Shawn,
 but no matter
how good you are,
 there's always somebody
who's better.
 And there's one rule
In gambllng,
 the house always wlns.
Eventually.
 Do you understand
what I'm saylng?
 Don't gamble.
 Not for money.
 GUS: I got 10 bucks says
you can't make thls shot. Ooh!
 (GUS EXHALING)
 Gus, I can't take your money.
 That's rlght.
'Cause you can't
make the shot.
 I could easlly
make the shot,
 whlch Is why
I can't take your money.
There's no sport In It.
 I say you're all mouth.
 I'm all mouth?
Yep.

 How do you do that?
It's the sweetness.
 So, thls Is how
you spend your days.
 Oh, my God!
Dad, what are
you dolng here?
 Nlce. Is that the way
you greet all the people
that come through your door?
 That's exactly
how I greet everyone.
 Maybe that's why
buslness Is down.
Hmm.
 Are you gonna Invlte me In?
 Oh, yeah, please...
No!
 Thls could be a trlck.
 What's the rule wlth vamplres,
don't they have to be
Invlted In?
 What are you talklng about,
Shawn?
 Gus, you've seen
Lost Boys 14 tlmes.
What's the rule?
 You're on your own.
 Is thls all there Is?
 Actually, thls Is
the, uh, satelllte offlce.
 Maln headquarters Is
In an underground Ice cave
 Gus and I sculpted
last wlnter.
 What about your Ilcense?
 Ahem, my pllot's Ilcense?
It's out back In the Cessna.
 Or perhaps you're referrlng
to my Ilcense to klll.
 Revoked. Problems
at the Kazakhstan border.
 I could glve you
the detalls, but then
I'd have to klll you,
 whlch I can't do because
my Ilcense to klll
has been revoked.
 I'm talkln' about
your prlvate eye Ilcense.
 Well, you need one, don't ya?
 Psychlcs are exempt
from the requlrements.
 Oh, well,
hurray for loopholes!
 A Ilttle dark.
 Probably could use
a couple more lamps, you know,
probably kllllng your eyes.
 That outlet... Ah, yeah,
looks a Ilttle overloaded.
 Yeah, I thlnk that plasma,
you'd probably do better
by puttln' It on that wall,
 you'd have less glare
comln' In through the wlndow
In the afternoon.
 You know what, Dad,
I really appreclate
you makln' the long drlve down
 and Feng Shul It up
sweet for us,
 but we're klnd of
In the mlddle
of somethlng here.
 What would that be, Shawn?
Would that be NBA
 garbage can hoops,
or trlvla super challenge?
 Belleve It or not,
we have an 11:00.
 So maybe
we should wrap thls up.
 Yeah, It's a Ilttle too late
for that, Shawn.
 I am your 11:00.
 I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth
 I know, you know

 HENRY: Blll Peterson.
He owns Peterson Motors.
 Met hlm about 20 years ago
when I grabbed
a couple of punks
 boostlng tlres
off of hls lot.
 Shawn, shouldn't you be
wrltlng some of thls down?
 Why would I do that?
Wlll there be a qulz?
 Just shut up
and pay attentlon.
 I got a call
from hlm yesterday.
He's got a kld, Brandon.
 He's just a Ilttle younger
than you.
 He thlnks hls son mlght be
mlxed up In somethlng.
 Llke what?
Well, he'll flll you In
when he gets here.
 The polnt Is, he doesn't want
the cops Involved.
So, he called me.
 And you sald...
I sald I'm retlred
 and he should deflnltely
Involve the cops.
 Sweet. You came all the way
down here to tell us that.
Awesome.
 No, Shawn. He doesn't want
hls son In trouble,
 and I mlght have mentloned
to Peterson accldentally
that, you, uh...
 You mlght be able to help.
 Whoa, tlme out!
Flag on the play!
Dld you vouch for me?
 No, I wouldn't say
I exactly vouched for you.
 Gus, Henry vouched for me.
I dld not vouch for you!
 You were bragglng on me.
You have a dad-crush on me.
 Shawn, I was not
bragglng on you.
 I merely restated stats
about your track record
that are In the newspaper.
 Let's hug It out.
Put your arms down.
 Glmme a hug.
Put your...
No, I'm not gonna glve you...
 If I'd known that
Peterson was gonna
Inslst on hlrlng you,
 I would've blasted
your character outrlght
 and I would've mentloned
your unnatural fear
of polnty thlngs.
 Ah!
Dlstaste for polnty thlngs.
 Please,
just do me thls one favor.
 Would you Ilsten
to the man's story,
tell hlm you can't help?
 Send hlm to the cops,
and whatever you do,
 don't do It wlth all that
rolllng your eyes around
 and all that floppy crap.
 What Is thls?
 Flrst of all,
I don't flop around
all the tlme, okay?
 My game Is predlcated
on flnesse.
 How dare
you crltlclze my job?
He's here, he's here.
 Okay, don't tell hlm
I came by.
 You got a back way
out of thls place?
You came through It.
 Oh, rlght.
 (PETERSON CLEARING THROAT)
 Excuse me, you Shawn?
 Yes, that's correct,
Mr. Peterson.
 Wow, that Is my name.
 Don't be
too Impressed, Blll,
 I could have gotten
that Informatlon anywhere.
 After all,
Peterson Motors Is glgantlc.
 Yeah, well,
I'm sultably Impressed.
 Don't be. Burton Guster.
 Pleasure to meet you.
 Look, I'll get rlght to It.
I have a son, Brandon.
 Up untll a few weeks ago,
he worked for me.
Now he's dlsappeared.
 What happened
a few weeks ago?
I flred hlm.
 He was lazy,
dlrectlonless.
 I thought I could get hlm
to buckle down,
focus In on somethlng.
 How dld that go?
 Well, he's been evlcted
from hls apartment,
hls cell phone's been cut off
 and he forged a check
from my account
to the tune of $30,000.
 I need to flnd my son.
Can you help me?
 Well, Mr. Peterson,
thls sounds Ilke a case
for the pollce.
 Let me get you a number.
 Gus, don't be a gooey
chocolate chlp cookle.
What?
 Thls Is preclsely
what we do here, slr.
 We flnd people.
We'll flnd your Brandon.
 Okay, make sure
we are not dlsturbed.
 I need flve mlnutes
unlnterrupted.
Make sure no one comes In.
 Yeah.
 VICK: What's wlth
all the secrecy, O'Hara?
 I've got a real mlndbender.
 Problem wlth
the rallway theft?
 No. It's a detectlve.
 Is thls somethlng
for Internal Affalrs?
 It's Detectlve Lasslter.
 What's the problem
wlth our Head Detectlve?
 Well, It's hls blrthday.
 Oh, that's not a problem.
 Yeah! It Is!
He seems qulet.
 He Is qulet.
That's who he Is.
 Look, O'Hara, I thlnk
It's nlce that you care
for your partner,
 but he Is a grown man.
He'll be flne.
 I just thought
It would be nlce
to surprlse hlm.
 Oh...
 Detectlve Lasslter
does not Ilke surprlses.
 Of course he Ilkes surprlses.
Everybody Ilkes surprlses.
 Detectlve Lasslter
has a very partlcular
comfort zone.
 And you don't even wanna
know what we now call the
Secret Santa Debacle of 2005.
 I just wanted to do
somethlng nlce for hlm,
 but nobody seems to know
what he Ilkes!
 Well, you're hls partner,
shouldn't you know?
 Well, we don't really talk.
 I mean, he doesn't.
 He nods and responds mostly.
He never really
poses a questlon.
 Although sometlmes he asks
If we can rlde In sllence.
 O'Hara, your heart
Is In the rlght place,
 but I am very sure
that you're gonna have to
do thls yourself.
 Okay, flne.
 Shawn, what are we doln' here?
 Brandon's dad sald
he was evlcted.
 Gus, let me
ask you somethlng.
 When's the last tlme
you were evlcted
from your apartment?
 Never!
 Exactly.
You wouldn't understand.
 Thls Is my world.
 So the landlord keeps
Brandon's stuff as collateral.
 Brandon comes back,
the landlord gets pald,
 Brandon doesn't,
there's a garage sale.
 Well, the buzzer upstalrs
says that hls Is 227.
 227? Marla Glbbs.
Reglna Klng.
 JackÃ©e!
Hal Wllllams.
 Hal Wllllams?
Hal Wllllams
as Lester Jenklns.
 Yeah, rlght.
 Looks Ilke somebody
took a screwdrlver
to thls thlng.
 Lemme see.
 Okay, so Brandon needed
somethlng Inslde here,
but he couldn't get In.
 If you were In hls shoes,
what would you do next?
 Flrst of all,
I'd feel very
ashamed of myself.
 Tell me about It.
 But then,
 I thlnk I'd come back
wlth some sclssors.
 (SHAWN GRUNTING)
 Let's see If we can flnd
what he's reachlng for.
 Yeah, lemme reach.
My reach Is better.
 Excuse me?
What?
 When exactly dld we have
a reachlng contest?
 My reach has always
been better.
 But my arms are slender-erer.
Slender-erer?
 What?
Slendererer...
 Sklnnler?
Yes.
 You know what? You're rlght.
My blceps probably wouldn't
flt through thls thlng anyway.
 I knew you'd fall for that!
 (GRUNTING)
 Let me see.
 Hmm. Flnal notlce,
flnal notlce, flnal notlce,
plus an evlctlon?
 Gosh, thls kld has
some serlous
cash flow problems.
 No wonder why
he stole from hls pops.
 What do you got?
A bunch of pawnshops.
 Whoa! Walt a second.
 If you're a guy
wlth an apartment,
 what's the one thlng
you deflnltely don't have?
 I don't know. A horse?
 A horse, that's true!
 (IMITATING BUZZER)
 Answer we were looklng for
was yard or garden.
 I would have accepted
both yard and garden.
 I was joklng, Shawn.
 So If you're a guy
wlthout a yard or a garden...
Shawn!
 ...why would you have
a buslness card
for a garden supply store?
 What Is R-R-L-R-L-L?
 Rrlrll. Rrlrll.
 Of course. Rrlrll.
 No, no. Rrlrll! Rrlrll.
 What does It mean?
 We should probably
flgure that out, huh?
You thlnk?
 GUS: How long are we
gonna slt here?
 Brandon mlght not even
show up.
 When I suggested
we do a stakeout,
you were, Ilke,
 "No, no, we need to do
somethlng actlve."
 I am dolng
somethlng actlve.
What?
 I'm preparlng to try
and enjoy thls chalupa.
 Odd.
 No, what's odd,
the customers that keep
drlvlng Into thls place.
 Look at these cars.
They're rldlculous!
 They're all fancy
and what not.
 Not exactly what you'd use
to plck up shrubs
and fertlllzer.
 Let's see what
these people are up to.
 Let's go!
 SHAWN: Ah!
 Wrong turn.
 What the...
 Dude, It's a maze.
 What is "R-R-L-R-L-L"?
 Shawn, what are you dolng?
 Rlght, rlght.
 Dude, the letters on
the back of that card
were dlrectlons.
 Follow me.
All rlght.
 Rlght.
 Rrlrll...
 Rrlrll, rrlrll.
Shawn!
 Rlght.
 Left...
 Left...
 (SIGHING) Yes!
 Whoa, walt a second.
Walt a second.
 Maybe we should
take a peek and see what
we're gettlng Into, Shawn.
 Ooh, you know
what thls Is, Shawn?
 It's one of those
underground poker games.
 My poker buddles
talk about them.
 SHAWN: Slnce when do you have
poker buddles?
 My onllne poker buddles,
Shawn.
 I'm good.
I'm up $7 mllllon dollars.
 You have $7 mllllon dollars
and you falled to mentlon It
to me tlll just now?
 It's not real money, Shawn.
That's Illegal.
 Rough luck there agaln, huh?
 Yeah, a blt of bad luck.
 Dude, you should get
In thls game.
How?
 These games are tlght.
You gotta know somebody
to get In.
 Well, let's just throw
Brandon's name around,
maybe they'll let us In.
 Uh, yeah, one more hand,
I'll get It.
 It's just not worklng out
for you today, Is It?
No. Not rlght now.
 I'll tell you what.
Why don't you stand up here?
 I'm just gonna...
Come on. Come here.
 It's okay. It's okay.
 Okay.
Just relax now.
 Put your hand up
Ilke thls.
Why?
 Just hold It up.
There you go.
 Now, maybe next tlme,
you won't force me
 Into such a barbarlc form
of retrlbutlon.
 Good news, there appears
to be a seat openlng up.
 Stlll, I thlnk our best
course of actlon would be...
 Get the hell outta here!
Go!
 Go! Go, go!
 I want you to know
I cannot hear
anythlng you say!
 Shawn,
what the hell Is golng on?
 What the...
Shawn, what are you dolng?
 It's hls ongolng
sensory-deprlvatlon
experlment,
 sharpenlng one sense
by denylng others.
 In thls case, he can't hear,
whlch only ampllfles
hls sense of smell.
 What?
Amazlng!
 That's one word for It.
 I need complete
and utter sllence.
 What do you need
sllence for, Shawn,
If you can't hear anythlng?
 Shh!
Please! Henry,
let the boy work.
 I smell chlps!
 Potato, po-tah-to!
 Let's call
the whole thlng off!
 Mr. Peterson,
I want you to grab my arm.
 Both hands,
Ilke you're dolng a pull-up.
 Feel the burn.
 I wlll now become a condult
to your son's thoughts.
 Please, clear your mlnd
and your nasal passages.
 Thlnk of nothlng but Brandon
and those chlps.
 Gus, present spuds!
 I'm gettlng somethlng.
 It's not clear.
 That's a shocker.
 Oh, ah, I'm wrong!
It's not potato!
 Gus, lose the spuds!
 Chlps! Ponch! John!
 Strlker! Cracker! Poker!
 Poker? I hardly know her!
 Shawn.
Poker chlps!
 Well, what the hell do
poker chlps smell Ilke, Shawn?
 They smell
Ilke butterflles.
 Poker chlps...
 And playlng cards.
 Ah!
What?
 What about the poker chlps
and the playlng cards?
 Ah! Gus, It burns!
 (GRUNTS)
 (PANTING)
 The Ilnk has been broken.
 I'll have to read the cards,
 see what they say.
 Shawn!
 There's your son.
 Notlce there are no dlamonds
around hlm.
 Well,
dlamonds represent wealth.
 So Brandon lost hls wealth
playlng poker?
 That's correct, Gus.
 Yeah, well,
what do all these clubs
around hlm mean, Shawn?
 Clubs, clubs are Ilke
 clover.
 He's been playlng poker
In a garden.
 Wlth thls guy.
 We need a name.
 Has he mentloned
any of the guys
he plays poker wlth?
 DumbLuck2.
 That was hls onllne

 Here, you can have Brandon.
 Thanks.

 If you get hlm shot...

 Personal questions?
 You're not a cop.
 Thls Is some klnd of

 You'll want my Social Security

 Well, suck lemons, Cooklepuss!

 SHAWN: What are you dolng?

 Hmm.
Looks Ilke a full house, huh?
 How dld you know that?
 You went...
 I don't do that, Shawn.
 I dldn't do that!
 Two palr.
 I'd call. And ralse.
 You're slttlng
on pocket rockets.
 You're not gonna do
any better than that.
 Serlously,
how do you do that?
 It's a good thlng you're not
a real poker player, Gus.
 You'd lose more money
than Brandon.
 I'm a stellar player, Shawn.
And don't thlnk...
 Walt a second.
What?
 He's on now! Brandon.
 Great! Brlng hlm In.
 Brlng hlm In how?
 Say, "Hey, Brandon,

 Perfect. Scoot over.
Glve me some room

 Baltlng the hook? How?
 You can't do thls, Shawn!
Thls Is my account!
Shh, relax.
 Don't you tell me to...
You don't have a proflle.
 They don't know
If "Blg Kltty" Is a man or...
I'm a man!
 The players I play poker wlth,
chat wlth,
know that I'm a man, Shawn!
 That's funny,
 'cause It appears
Brandon thlnks
that you're a...
 A cheerleader?
 "Where does a glrl

for fun and games?"
 Stop It, Shawn! Get the...
 Relax!
I can't transfer

Polnsettla?
 That's a plant, not a flower.
 And It's out of season.
Perfect.
 We'll see just how badly

 (SHRIEKING)
 Ah! He's punctual.
 I Ilke that In a date.
 Whoa, guys,

 We know.
Fellcla.
 Yeah, how do you know...
 Huh. She's not comln', Is she?
 He's Fellcla.
 And I'm Fellcla.
 Great! Yeah, I knew It.
 All hot Internet women

 Of course, you're two guys,
whlch makes It doubly welrd.
 Sorry, Brandon,
but your Dad's

 SHAWN: That's the rub.
He hlred us.
 Oh, yeah?
Well, the joke's on you
'cause I'm outta here.
 Hey, we just wanna talk.
 What's goln' on?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
 You, uh,

 So how's It goln',

 Oh!
 You were saylng?
 Well, It looks Ilke
your dad's not the only one
who's lookln' for ya, huh?
 All rlght, look.
You guys gotta glve me
a break, okay?
 I stole $30,000 dollars
from my dad
 and then I lost It,
and more, to that jerk,
J.P. Berger.
 So I can't go home,
not untll I wln enough
to pay everybody back.
 What'd he say,
you've got tlll Monday?
 Yeah, he dld,
but see, the thlng Is,
 I'm a better player
than he Is. I am much better.
 And yet he bent you
over hls knee
 and spanked you
In front of
the whole class.
 But he shouldn't have!
 I just... I just gotta
flgure out how he dld It.
 Look, Brandon, It's slmple.
 You go to your dad
and convlnce hlm
to glve you your job back.
 And then you flgure out a way
to pay thls Berger back
hls money.
 Yeah,
that sounds really great.
 But, guys,
I can't go back to work
for my dad.
 Nothlng I do Is ever
good enough for that man,
nothlng Is rlght.
 You have no Idea
what that's Ilke.
 Look,
here's some brutal truth.
 We're the only reasons
you're not In jall, or worse.
 Your dad's done.
 It took someone cashlng In
a very old favor
to get us Involved at all.
 Now, you are not gonna
be able to play your way
out of thls hole, baby boy!
 So pack It In!
Pull the plug! Shut It down!
 Leave the dead meat
In the freezer
and put on your Sunday best,
 'cause It's Arbor Day, baby!
 Okay. Falr enough.
 Let's get thls over wlth.
 Take me to my father.
 BRANDON: What'd I tell ya?
 Mornlng tlll nlght,
the old man
never stops selllng.
 Want some advlce?
 Yeah, sure.
 When you owe a man
$30,000 dollars,
 I'd be careful about
crltlclzlng hls work ethlc.
 That's a good polnt.
 You want us
to come wlth you?
 No. No, you know what?
 I screwed up on my own,
I am gonna face hlm
on my own.
 That's very
Cameron Frye of you.
 It's Cameron who?
 Wow, are we that much
older than you?
 What's that?
 That's nothln'.
It's a good luck charm.
 I mean, used to be.
But you know what?
 Here. I don't need It.
 I've glven up cards,
I got no use for It.
 Whoa! No, thanks.
Not really a jewelry guy.

Ah-ha!

 HENRY: Well, well.
 Don't you look Ilke hell.

 Everyone who gets up

 Wlth the posslble exceptlon

 Mr. Peterson,

Somethlng wrong?
 No, no, Shawn,
everythlng Is great.
 That's why I woke your ass up,
had you zlp down here

whoa, whoa, whoa.
You found hlm?
 Well, yeah, we dld.
 When was thls?
Yesterday.
 I'm sorry, slr,

 He dldn't come In?
You never saw hlm?
 Oh, we saw hlm, all rlght.
 I got the reunlon rlght here.
You wanna see It?
 PETERSON: There he Is,
there's my boy.
 Guess he couldn't face me,
so he walted untll
after I went home.
 Not the safe?
He's breaklng Into
your safe?
 Breaklng In? No,
he dldn't have to break In.
 He's too smart for that.
 He knows the comblnatlon!
 There you have It.
Not qulte the reunlon
I Imaglned.
 So tell me, psychlc,
 where's my son now?
 SHAWN: Somethlng's
botherlng me, dude.
 I'm never wrong!
 You're always wrong,
what are you talkln' about?
 That thls kld should be
a better poker player, Gus.
 That was a pretty good bluff.
 Oh, dude, look!
 What?
Rlght there.
That necklace thlng.
 That's horrlble.
 He wears hls rldlculous
good luck charm Into battle
 the way that Superman
wears hls cape,
 or Rocky Balboa
wears hls belt.
 I bet you he's on hls way
back to the maze
to take on Berger.
 No, Berger's not gonna be
at the lawn and garden center.
Not thls weekend.
 Why not?
 There's a tournament goln' on
where the wlnner gets a buy-In
to the World Poker Derby.
 You know where that Is?
 Of course I do!
Phew!
 Ooh! Phew! Ah!
Oh, It's fllpplng!

to get hls attentlon.
 May I have that DVD, please?
 (SHAWN EXCLAIMS)
 No.
 Excuse me?
Shawn!
 Not yet.
 Why?
 Let's glve hlm another chance.
 I'm senslng there's

 He's actually

 Not wlth my money
he's not.
 Let's go.
Oh, God.
 We're outta here.

 Would you rather

 I know,
I'm sorry about all that.
 No, Brandon. Let's go.
 No, Dad, Dad,
I'm In more trouble here

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

But keep In mlnd

 What do you thlnk, Henry?
Can he wln?
 Dad, I don't gamble. I win.
 Yeah. He can wln.
 So, what's the deal?
 GUS: Shawn and Berger
drew opposlte tables.
 The only way for hlm

everyone at hls table,
 makes It to the flnals,
and wlns.
 Check.
 God, must be rough.
 Sorry?
 You plcked the wrong week
to qult smoklng, dude.
 There's a tournament

 You thlnk you can mess

 Here's the thlng,
I'm a psychlc.
 So If I had to guess,

 Yes, I can mess wlth your head

sandwlch In your halr.
 Well, you know what?
I'm not playlng
wlth a psychlc.
 It's agalnst the rules.
 Agalnst the rules?
No, guys, guys,
I checked the rulebook.
 I looked In the Index
under "P".
 It mentloned polygamy,
pancakes, and pterodactyls.
 Who knew pterodactyl started
wlth a "P"?
 I bet you dld. You dld.
 It's not agalnst the rules,
Ronnle. It's cool.
 No, It's not cool.
 Look at your stack, man.
 Everythlng's here.
Everythlng's here.

 Walt, walt, walt.
 The chlps demand

 Shh! I can't hear them
If you're talklng, Berger.

 Chlps say

pumpkln-eater!
 (SHAWN LAUGHING)
 Is that rlght?
SHAWN: Yeah.
 And how do they know that?
 We're really supposed to
belleve that you're psychlc
or somethlng!
 If you were psychlc,
I wouldn't be cleanlng
your clock rlght now.
 Cleanlng my clock?
What does that mean, Berger?
 What, you'd take tlme out
of your day to clean
another man's tlmeplece?
 And If so,
that would be a bad thlng?
 No, I would be graclous.
I would say, "J.P., dude,
 "thanks for
sprltzlng my watch."
 Besldes, It doesn't matter.
 Doesn't take a psychlc
to flgure out that
these cards are marked.
 You know what,
If you had been
paylng attentlon,
 you'd reallze that
the decks were all sealed.
 Shh! He's saylng

What do you got for me?
 Well, come on, guys,

 Check the...
 Oh!
 For shame!

 Ah-ha!
 SHAWN: Face card.
Face card.
 Well, how's that posslble?
These are brand-new decks.
 We got spotters

 Okay, I'm on the dealer.

 (PEOPLE CHATTERING)
 In between the lines
there's a lot of obscurity
 I'm not inclined
to resign to maturity
 If it's all right
then you're all wrong
 But why bounce around
to the same damn song?
 You'd rather run
when you can't crawl
 I know, you know
That I'm not telling the truth
 I know, you know
They just don't have any proof
 Embrace the deception
Learn how to bend
 Your worst inhibitions
tend to psych you out
in the end
 I know, you know
 I know, you know
