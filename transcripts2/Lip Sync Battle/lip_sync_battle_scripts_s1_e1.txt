But I love you. I love you, too. Chrissy, you've seen them both. What do you think? I don't know if anyone has ever uttered this before, but Jimmy left me breas... breath... [Sputters, laughs] [Laughter] Breastless! Breastless? Nobody has left me breastless ever. Oh. Okay, okay. Sorry, y'all. No, Jimmy left me breathless. But I wasn't looking at... Chrissy's breath. - Breath, yes. - You weren't? You promise? No, I mean, it's cold in here, you can to see a lot of people's breath, but I wasn't looking at her breaths at all. It's cold outside. We understand. - [Audience cheers] - So, uh, coming up, get ready to see Jimmy go to church. Dwayne's going back to the '70s. Stay tuned for more "Lip Sync Battle." ♪ Shake it off ♪ ♪ I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake ♪ Welcome back to "Lip Sync Battle." Now it's time for both stars to stop talking the talk and start walking the walk. We're moving into round 2. [Cheers and applause] The lip-sync battle royale... with cheese. [Laughter] Jimmy had to put in some real work in this. He put in 10,000 hours of rehearsal time. No pain, no gain. And now let's take a look at how he prepared for the battle. There's a lot of things you can do to prepare for "Lip Sync Battle." I mean, sometimes, just talking to people, I just... Just put in a little extra lip movement. I don't know if you saw it. I just snuck a couple in there. You know? I'm so good at lip-syncing, I can even lip-sync words backwards. I can talk backwards. [Speaking backwards] That is "I'm ready to come and beat the Rock and conquer and leave with the belt." I don't want to embarrass him, but if it happens, it happens, you know? And he's just got to be a big boy and put his big-boy pants on. Of course, I'll never say any of this to his face. 'Cause when I see him, I'll be like, "Hey! Hey, Dwayne." "How are you, man?" You know what? I got to get in my zone right now. You can come with me. This is what I have to do to find my inner peace.

[Laughter] We go out, we go everywhere together. [Laughter] Jimmy, obviously you were divinely inspired. I appreciate that. Yeah, I was. I felt I had to get in there and let people know how much they mean to me. You're all like a child whispering to me. [Laughter] Now, Dwayne, Dwayne... Yes? How are you still here?! I am still here. - You should go home. - Still here. I feel bad for you, 'cause... Yeah. This is tough. But, look, see that belt up there? Yeah. It's not going home with you. [Audience ohhs] But I have a belt that you can take home. I had this made. Here you go, dude. [Laughter] There you go, man. [Audience awws] Well, thank you so much. [Cheers and applause] How'd you like that? But, Jimmy, what's he gonna put that around? [Laughs] Wait! Let me have that. Next up, my man Dwayne Johnson will have a chance to redeem himself.

Now let's see how Dwayne prepared for his face-off with Jimmy. [Audience cheers] I'm cool, just like Bruce Lee. I've flown all the way up to New York City. It's my home away from home. I told you I was coming to win the title, Jimmy, and I'm not backing down from that, because, at the end of the day, there's a reason why they call me the jabroni-beating, pie-eating, trail-blazing, eyebrow-raising. I told you I'm gonna come in, I'm gonna take the title, and that's exactly what I'm doing. My game is on fleek. I love saying the word "fleek." Now, did I hire a lip-sync trainer? That's not the point. [Laughs] The point is, I came here to kick ass, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do. I'm the mother[Bleep] Rock. I'm gonna be a bad mother[Bleep] up there... boom... and lip-sync at the same time [High-pitched voice] on fleek.
