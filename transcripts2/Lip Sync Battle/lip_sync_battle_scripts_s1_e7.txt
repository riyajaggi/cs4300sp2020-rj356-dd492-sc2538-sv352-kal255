 You've seen it on TV, you've seen it online, you've seen it everywhere, so you know the game is simple. Two stars lip-sync two songs. The audience decides who did it the best, okay? [Cheers and applause] The songs the performers picked are aimed to psych out their opponent. They picked songs knowing the audience is looking for a degree of difficulty, style, lip-sync ability. We clear? [Cheers and applause] Right now, here to help me out is our color commentator, my girl Chrissy Teigen. [Rap music playing]

 She'll be throwing down her totally uncut reactions tonight. Go, Chrissy. So, at stake is more than pride, bragging rights, and showing you have lip-sync swag. The winner will take home the ultimate trophy... the lip sync championship belt. Chrissy, can you show them the grand prize? Look at this thing. Is that not amazing? Have you ever seen a belt like this before? [Cheers and applause] Yeah, get it, yeah. Shine it up. You guys ready for a battle? [Cheers and applause] First up, she's a TV star, a movie star. She's an amazing actress. Malin Akerman. [Cheers and applause] Let's meet Malin's opponent. He is the 1998 English lip-syncing champion, who has come out of retirement for this one-time match. Everybody, look way, way up in the sky at Stephen Merchant. [Cheers and applause] Yeah, right there. Oh, wow. [British accent] Good luck, sweet cheeks. Good luck. - Good luck, sugar bum. - Oh, my goodness. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh, a little gamesmanship. - Don't call me "sweet cheeks." - Just chill. Just chill, sweet. [Laughter] Okay... I like the fake British accent. It's great. Thank you. Now, Stephen demanded that he goes first. Stephen, have a seat in the lounge. [Laughter] The V.I.P. lounge. Malin, come on over. [Cheers and applause] So, Malin. Yes. What is the story? 'Cause I heard it's an intense story. What is the story behind your first pick? Well, you know, it's funny, because I was on the plane with Stephen Merchant years back, and, you know, we were sitting beside each other, and he had a couple drinks in, and he got a little saucy, and he started talking [Bleep] to me. Mm. And in the middle of our conversation, he goes, "you know, I want to pour some sugar on you." I was like, "you want to what?" Stephen's a freak? [Laughter] To be fair, I was drunk. I was drunk. [Laughs] So, what song, exactly, are you gonna do for the people? Def Leppard's "Pour Some Sugar on Me." [Cheers and applause] [Intro plays] ♪ Love is like a bomb, baby, come on, get it on ♪ ♪ livin' like a lover with a radar phone ♪ ♪ lookin' like a tramp, like a video vamp ♪ ♪ demolition woman, can I be your man? ♪ ♪ Your man ♪ ♪ razzle and dazzle and flash a little light ♪ ♪ television lover, baby, go all night ♪ ♪ sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet ♪ ♪ little miss innocent, sugar me ♪ ♪ yeah ♪ ♪ yeah ♪ ♪ come on! ♪ ♪ Take a bottle ♪ ♪ take a bottle ♪ ♪ shake it up ♪ ♪ shake it up ♪ ♪ break the bubble ♪ ♪ break it up ♪ ♪ break it up ♪ ♪ pour some sugar on me ♪ ♪ ooh, in the name of love ♪ ♪ pour some sugar on me ♪ ♪ come on, fire me up ♪ ♪ pour your sugar on me ♪ ♪ I can't get enough ♪ ♪ I'm hot, sticky, sweet ♪ ♪ from my head to my feet, yeah ♪ [Cheers and applause] Thank you. This is not fair. It's really not fair at all. But I was... I didn't realize we were allowed to use our sex appeal. [Laughter] You still got your chance. You still have your chance, Stephen. You can do it now. Some of that, frankly, young lady, was pornographic. Yeah. Your mother's backstage, woman! I saw her. She taught me everything I know. - She... - Oh, yes. Did you want to pour sugar on her? Actually, I have... I have everything. [Crowd cheering] Well, I like it dirty. My dream came true! - Don't slip and fall on your sugar, now. Stephen, Stephen, Stephen, Stephen, Stephen, Stephen. Stephen, Stephen, Stephen. We're gonna get arrested. Yeah, we... no, you're gonna get arrested. Good luck, Stephen. You was throwing a lot of sugar around there, big boy. I thought this was a classy show, ll. I was under that impression, too. I didn't realize we were dealing with vulgarians. Stephen... I could have brought a one-piece catsuit. Excuse me. [Chuckles] Your pride is on the line, all right? A little freaky, a little kinky. Yeah. What's your first song? Well, as Malin's already hinted, when people look at me, they think of sex symbol. Yes. And they think of my deep, rich, olive skin. Yes. So what better choice than Enrique Iglesias' "Hero"? [Cheers and applause] [Intro plays] Let me be your hero. ♪ Would you dance if I asked you to dance? ♪ ♪ Would you run and never look back? ♪ [Laughs] ♪ Would you cry if you saw me crying? ♪ ♪ Would you save my soul tonight? ♪ ♪ I can be your hero, baby ♪ [Cheers and applause] ♪ I can kiss away the pain ♪ ♪ oh, yeah ♪ ♪ I will stand by you forever ♪ ♪ you can take my breath away ♪ ♪ quiero ser tu héroe ♪ ♪ si pudiera ser tu dios ♪ ♪ porque salvarte a ti mil veces ♪ ♪ puede ser mi salvación ♪ ♪ you can take my breath away ♪ ♪ I can be your hero ♪ [Cheers and applause] Teigen: Good. Good. Good. Look at him now. The lights were in my eyes. I was singing to a woman, right? [Laughter] No, actually, it was this dude over here with the lumberjack shirt. [Laughter] I mean, you really are a Latin lover. Thank you very much. Why do you know that? Uh, well, you know... Have you been reading my journal again? Absolutely, I've been all in your journal. [Laughter] Malin, was that not amazing? Yeah, it was not amazing, yeah. [Crowd booing] I'm just joking. [Laughs] Stephen and Malin are both off to a great start, but that's just how I saw it. Miss Chrissy Teigen, what'd you think? I mean, on one end, we have the stripper song of the century. Malin, that was fantastic. Oh, with the sugar? Somebody in here has heard that at a strip club. That's not just me. [Laughter] I didn't even know... one of my biggest weaknesses is a Brit speaking Spanish. Ooh. And I thought it was pretty good. All right. See you later, mate. [Laughter] [Cheers and applause] Come on. Okay. LL Cool J: Okay, so, it's game on between Malin Akerman and Stephen Merchant. Stay tuned for more.

Malin's up first, so let's check out how she got ready for action. _ Because Stephen Merchant in real life is a [Bleep] asshole. He's always talking about all his, like, "Flashdance" moves that he's got. And I was like, "you know what, Merchant?" We're gonna bring it, and everyone's gonna see what a dick you are "and how your 'Flashdance' moves are not so flashy after all." Those fake British people. [Chuckles] _ - _ - _ _ _ Oh, god. Oh, god. Hey, Stephen, you fake [Bleep] Brit, I'm gonna [Bleep] bring you down like a mother[Bleep] brick house, boy. Oh, my god, it's starting, it's starting! Teigen: LL Cool J.

You know that I am one of the most fierce lip-sync competitors. I know. And a veteran of the game. But fair is fair. I felt Malin there gave you a run for your own hip-hop flow. [Cheers and applause] That's why I'm the host. [Laughs] When it's over, it's over. [Laughter] Chrissy, what did you think? She's, like, the most adorable gangster I've ever seen. She looks like if American Girl dolls made, like, a thug Samantha. [Laughter] I love it. Well, Malin, you go over there with Stephen. Tell him where he can buy some illegal guns at. [Cheers and applause] That was dirty, dirty good. Stay tuned for more Stephen Merchant and Malin Akerman on "Lip Sync Battle." ♪ Talk dirty to me ♪ Welcome back to "Lip Sync Battle." The world is about to find out who gets to win the most coveted championship belt in the universe. Stephen is about to break out the performance of his life. Let's see how he plans to one-up his lovely opponent. Right now, I'm at intensity level 4. But when I hit that stage, I'm gonna be 4 1/2. I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. But I'm gonna use that nervousness as an energy that I can feed off, like a giant tyrannosaurus rex devouring the rotting corpse of... anxiety. Does that metaphor work? I feel like it got complicated. Merchant, you've got this. Don't think about her. Just think about yourself. Don't think about all the kids that laughed and pointed at you at school and said, "oh, look, here's the giant, lanky freak." Don't think about what your mother said... "oh, Steve, you'll never amount to anything." Focus, enjoy, 'cause it's your time. Malin, watch out, because I dance like a butterfly and I sting like a butterfly.
