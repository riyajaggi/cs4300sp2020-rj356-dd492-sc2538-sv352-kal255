 Here to help me tonight, as always, is our color commentator, the lovely, the talented, my girl, Chrissy Teigen. [Rap music plays] [Cheers and applause] Yeah! Go, Chrissy! Go, Chrissy! The stars know why they're here... to win. And what do they want to win? The lip sync belt. Chrissy, can you show them the belt? Look at this belt. I mean, it's pretty fantastic. I got to say, it's heavy as [Bleep]. - [Laughter] - Yeah, there you go. Are you ready? [Cheers and applause] Let's welcome our performers. First up, a two-time champion on "Dancing With the Stars"... [Cheers and applause] ... Julianne Hough! [Cheers and applause] Unbelievable. And her opponent, a five-time champion on "Dancing With the Stars"... Derek Hough! [Cheers and applause] Look at that look, that mean mug. Unbelievable. He's focused, ready for war. Look at her. She is serious. Okay. This is gonna get ugly. All right, so... so, we asked Derek who should go first, and, like the gentleman he is, he graciously said he should. [Laughter] - Typical. - Yeah. [Chuckles] And so it begins. Julianne, you can have a seat, of course. [Laughter] [Cheers and applause] This is your chance for a little sibling revenge. What's your first song? My first song is a song my mother used to sing to me as a child. And what song would that be? Macklemore, "Can't Hold Us Down." Aww. It's a beautiful song. It's beautiful. She... she does a way better job than I do, but I'm gonna try to do a good job for her. All right, well, fake rapping his way into America's hearts is Derek Hough with "Can't Hold Us"!

LL Cool J: Move over, Ryan Lewis! [Laughs] How do you think you did? Um, perfect. You did perfect. No, I'm just kidding. [Laughs] Yeah, yeah, I thought instead of the drop mike at the end, I'd just do a face... face drop instead. [Laughter] It was good. It was pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. - That was excellent. - Thank you. Yes. So, Julianne, what do you think about your big brother, here? Well, I feel like you pulled out all your stops with your pelvic thrusts and all of that stuff. That's your move. That's not even fair. It's my move. This is a lip-syncing contest. There was a lot of pelvic thrusting, and a lot of... - Derek, have a seat over there. - Yeah. Yeah. That was a long stare, bro. That was weird. No, no, look. All right, all right, hold up. Trust me, it wasn't that long. [Laughter] Julianne, come on over. [Cheers and applause] Julianne. Yes. Pretty tough act to follow... I mean, you know, backflip to the face? No, I got to be honest, I don't think I can do that in this skirt, so... [Chuckles] Pretty impressive. So, what song did you choose? What song? Well, I picked a song that both men and women can speak to, because we all like to do a little shake, shake. And, you know, I, uh... I thought it'd be really appropriate for me to do this in front of my brother, so... [Laughter] ... I'm gonna do Meghan Trainor's "All About That Bass." [Cheers and applause] It's a'ight.

[Cheers and applause] [Laughs] Wait, first of all, how'd you pull this off? [Laughs] You're supposed to be lip-syncing, - and you brought out the real... - I know! How lucky am I, by the way? - Holy cow! - Hey, guys. [Cheers and applause] Meghan, what did you think of Julianne's performance? I couldn't keep up. I was like, "whoa, we're doing this now. Okay." She's amazing. She's perfect. She's a superstar. I just got to get the booty, though, so I just used that. - It was cute. - [Laughter] Meghan Trainor, ladies and gentlemen! Hey, thank you. Thank you very much. I love you. Derek, what did you think of little sister's show? - What did I think? - Yeah. It was wildly inappropriate. [Laughter] And I'm... I just call disqualification. I mean, it's... you know, you can't do the real thing. Meghan, I thought we were friends. She came... she... yeah. [Laughter] Well, Julianne, have a seat in our almost-V.I.P. lounge. Almost. Okay. It's the very important pretenders when I'm in it. All right. Now, Chrissy, you saw it. - I did see it. - What's your opinion? As a female, I enjoyed watching... Julianne. [Laughter] No, no. I'm just kidding. No. My husband's here, so I didn't want to say it, but, Derek, I liked the thrusting, okay? I liked the thrusting. Thank you. I just love that they're so sweet-looking, and I just got bass and... and... Treble. A little treble, little bass. ... thrusts and treble... everything. Midrange ain't bad, either.

Now, it's all on the line in round two. One Hough will have a championship belt and bragging rights for the next 50 years. Now, Derek... he spent years becoming a great dancer, but it's nothing compared to his preparation for tonight. Let's check it out. Focus. Ooh! Ow. For years, I've been training as a dancer, but tonight, I am a lip-sync competitor. Yeah. One of those times when you realize, you're like, "what did I get myself into?" [Laughs] You're like, "wait, what am I doing?" I'm a little nervous, no lie. Don't even know the words to these songs. But it doesn't even matter, because that's how good I am. I'll go out there, and I'm just gonna be like, "watermelon, watermelon, watermelon." _ And you'll be like, "whoa, he's... he's just perfect." It's not just about the mouth movement or the syncing of the words you're singing. It's the connection with audience, and it's the way you look at the camera. You felt that. I know. [Cheers and applause] ♪ Party girls don't get hurt ♪ ♪ can't feel anything, when will I learn? ♪ ♪ I push it down, push it down ♪ ♪ I'm the one "for a good time, call" ♪ ♪ phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell ♪ ♪ I feel the love, feel the love ♪ ♪ one, two, three, one, two, three, drink ♪ ♪ one, two, three, one, two, three, drink ♪ ♪ one, two, three, one, two, three, drink ♪ ♪ throw 'em back till I lose count ♪ ♪ I'm gonna swing ♪ ♪ from the chandelier ♪ ♪ from the chandelier ♪ ♪ I'm gonna fly ♪ ♪ like a bird through the night ♪ ♪ feel my tears as they dry ♪ ♪ I'm gonna swing ♪ ♪ from the chandelier ♪ ♪ from the chandelier ♪ ♪ but I'm holding on for dear life ♪ ♪ won't look down, won't open my eyes ♪ ♪ keep my glass full until morning light ♪ ♪ 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight ♪ ♪ on for tonight, on for tonight ♪ ♪ 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight ♪ ♪ oh, I'm just holding on for tonight ♪ ♪ on for tonight, on for tonight ♪ [Cheers and applause] So, is "Chandelier" your new anthem? Yeah. Oh, man, it always has been. [Laughs] It's been in my head for a long time. I'm finally glad she came out with it. [Laughs] Yeah. So... so, Julianne, i... if you win, how many years before Derek, you know, lives this down? [Laughing] Even if I don't win, he's never living this down. That was the greatest thing I've ever seen. - [Crowd cheers] - All right. Will Julianne be able to dance her way to the top, or has Derek permanently hijacked the lead? We'll be right back on "Lip Sync Battle." ♪ I'm gonna swing ♪ Welcome back to "Lip Sync Battle." We in the middle of round two. Each star got a blank check to create the most showstopping number ever. This is their final shot to conquer their opponent. Let's take a look at how Julianne prepared for the biggest competition of her life. I got to be honest. [Coughs] [Laughing] I just picked up a mike. What was that? Performing and actually singing is way less terrifying than lip-syncing in front of these people. _ _ _ Winning this competition, for me, is probably the most important thing in history because the rivalry between Derek and I... I judge him on "Dancing With the Stars." He says it's because those who can't do judge. [Laughs] Are we good? We're done? Cameras off? Cool. Yeah, I'm gonna kick his [Bleep] [Bleep]. He is so going down [Bleep]. Ballsack. Yeah.
