I watched these two gentlemen rehearse, and they are in it to win it. And I'm a little nervous 'cause they're friends, and they might not be after this. [Laughs] Yeah, yeah, yeah. There was a little tension. There was some tension. We had to separate their dressing rooms. Like, they were close to each other. We made them further away. Yeah. They didn't want to hear each other.

[Laughs] Ladies and gentlemen, the man, the myth, here's John Legend. [Cheers and applause] Oh, that's nice. We asked Chrissy if she wanted her favorite singer to go first, and, of course, she said yes. Common! [Laughter] So, John, have a seat. Common, come on over. You go first. [Cheers and applause] Yeah. Okay. So, what's your first song? My first song is something... something real special for y'all. It's the Jackson 5 "I Want You Back." [Cheers and applause] Here with "I Want You Back," Common.

[Cheers and applause] That was the first concert I ever seen, was the Jackson 5, so I got to do that on this stage tonight, - on "Lip Sync," yeah. - Ahhh! John. John. We were back there doing a little back-up dancing. Yeah, man. I was having fun, man. I forgot I was in a competition, man. I was helping him too much. [Laughter] This happens to us all the time, honestly. He's too nice. I try to fight with him, and he will not. - Ever. - [Laughter] Like, I try to get it. He won't do it. Say something mean, John. That was terrible! [Laughter] You... Well, Common, you deserve a first-class seat right over there. Thank you, thank you, thank you. John, come on up. [Cheers and applause] Round of applause for John Legend. [Cheers and applause] Hey! What's your first song?

John hasn't been talking smack to me, 'cause when he see me, he looking scared. He looking like he ain't ready for what I'm about to deliver. I don't know if his name will be "John Legend" no more. He might just be "John Present" for one day. It ain't gonna be legendary, you know? [Laughs] If you watch this performance, you gonna feel, like, the vibrations of me singing.
