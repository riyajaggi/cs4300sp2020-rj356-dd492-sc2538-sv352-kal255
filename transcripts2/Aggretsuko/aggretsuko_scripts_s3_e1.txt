 Hey, are you ready yet? Sorry, I still don't know what to wear. Come on! Normally, it's girls who make boys wait. I want new clothes. Did you know the latest update comes with new outfits? I'm sure you'll like them. You'll purchase them for me, right? PROCEED TO PURCHASE PAID CONTENTS? Aw, Seiya, you're so good at convincing me! - How's this? - Yes, please!

 - And this? - Get it! - Should I extend my horn? - Definitely! It'll be 10% cheaper if you buy 20. I'll buy them all! TOTAL SAVINGS RAGE Just count to ten and I'll be a model employee. Good morning! Good morning, Retsuko! Morning, Retsuko. Oh, good. I made it in time... What's with your face? Is it that bad?

 Yeah. My alarm didn't go off this morning. There was no time for makeup or even a look in the mirror. That's not what I meant. I'm gonna do my makeup in the bathroom. I'll be going! That was close. I hope she didn't notice. Retsuko's been rather cheerful lately. Maybe she has a new boyfriend already! I'm not sure... ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT Hmm? Your makeup is quite thick today. Is that so? Maybe you're imagining things. So about that social mixer next month... Are you going? The admission is 5,000 yen, isn't it? Yup. Hmm... I'll pass. I've spent too much money this month. What? You're not going, Retsuko? Why not? Did you go on a big shopping spree? Well, you know, it was just... stuff. Like clothes? Yeah, something like that. What about you, Haida? I think I'll pass, too. I thought so. Did that mark go away? Yeah, somewhat. Correct me if I'm wrong, but here's my theory... After your romance with Mr. Tadano ended, it left a big hole in your heart. To fill that void, you found a virtual boyfriend. You became a loyal spender and dozed off with your goggles on last night, which brings us to today. Well? Huh? How did you come up with such a ridiculous story? Don't be silly! 20,000 yen? Just yesterday? For clothes you can't wear? It was actually 18,000 yen after the 10% discount. That changes nothing! You're on track to screw yourself over with such reckless spending. Don't worry. I'm doing it within my means. You're being a sucker. I know that. No, you don't! I won't take any more risks. Huh? I don't have any special talents, so I'll live with my feet on the ground. I'll just accept my place in life and not aim for more. I'm just going to work so I can live a mediocre life. Okay... But... even you couldn't stand such a dull life, could you? That's why I pay money for one dream-like moment! It gives me strength for the next day! Is that bad? And spending money on a bum like your virtual boyfriend isn't dull? Don't you dare talk bad about Seiya! Oh, you're in deep. It's nobody's business how I spend the money that I earn. Right, Seiya? You're on track to screw yourself over with such reckless spending. In short, it all comes down to will power! If I decide not to do it, then that's the end of the story. I won't buy anything today! It's settled! Oh, Seiya, I'm home! Aw, you're wearing the clothes I got you. I'm not buying anything for you today. Not today! I'm not buying anything! What is Retsuko doing? She's eating bread crusts. I thought so! The ones that bakeries give away, right? Hey, Retsuko. What's wrong? Are you alive? 200,000 yen. 200,000 yen? What? You wasted 200,000 yen on in-game items to win a luxury prize? You didn't win, but you were listed as a top-paying user, and Seiya praised you? Are you stupid? TOTAL SAVINGS WOMEN'S CHANGING ROOM I was stupid. Yeah. But I might buy one of Seiya's albums. What's super rare is that you get a real CD, not just a download! Isn't that amazing? Do you have a CD player? No... If you're forced to eat bread crusts, why don't you borrow from Anai? What? Apparently, he's going to publish a book. A book? Why? He's good at cooking, right? He posted his lunch recipes online every day and was contacted by a publisher. Wow, that's amazing. A side hustle, you know? Making the most of your talents outside of your main job. He's making a little extra money, so maybe he can help you out. I have enough to pay the rent, so I'll survive. If you say so. I haven't fallen so low that I'd need help from a junior. Oh, you've fallen low enough. A side hustle, huh? That's great. I don't have the skills or energy for that. Retsuko, do you want to invest? Invest? What's this, all of a sudden? She's been super into her side hustle lately. She's starting a company with a programmer friend to develop an app. You have a side hustle, too? And developing an app is such a serious business! I know. It's still in the trial stage but... Ta-da! GORI'S MARRIAGE COUNSELING What's this? It's a matchmaking app. I've lost hope in this country's matchmaking scene. Age, income... What's the point in matching up numbers like that? What's important is a fateful encounter with your soul mate! This is my revenge on the matchmaking industry. With years of experience as my weapon, I'll change this country! And I'll use this innovative app to do it! So how is it innovative? Well, that's next on our list. You look like you're enjoying yourself. It's really fun! I get to discover my own potential! Don't let it affect your day job, okay? I know! So, do you want to invest? Well, um... I'm sorry. I... don't have any money. What in the world is Retsuko eating? Probably something worse than bread crusts. BREAK ROOM What? A virtual boyfriend? Yeah. Funny, right? You shouldn't flaunt people's embarrassing secrets like that. I thought I should tell you. This could be your shot. A chance to sneak into that hole in Retsuko's heart. I don't really like to take advantage of people like that. Are you trying to make yourself look good? So you're still gonna wait, huh? Do you think she'll come to you because you're acting nice? - I... want to play it fair, like a man! - Play it fair by doing what? By asking her out for drinks as a friend, just to get rejected again? You're being naive. Someone's going to be single again this year! ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT What are you doing? Typing up a draft. A draft? It's a column for my upcoming book. It's okay to be passionate about your side job, but don't neglect your real job. I've finished all my tasks. I see. You seem kind of... different. What do you mean? Do you... have a girlfriend or something? Yes, I do. Oh... I see. I haven't been eating properly the last few days. MOM Hello. Retsuko? How are you doing? Are you eating well? I'm at work right now! I see. Anyway, I know this is short notice, but can you drive me to the hot spring? The hot spring? OX RENTAL CARS I was counting on your father to drive, but he has to attend a funeral all of a sudden! I've already booked a place, so why don't you come instead? Is that okay? I'll pay you for your time, of course. I'll gladly do it! White rice! So tasty! What do you normally eat? The blessings... of life. You don't want to come in? No, I want to return the car before it gets dark. You're so boring. Well, I can't help that. Well, then, take this. It's not much, but... Whoa, there's 20,000 yen here. Thank goodness. Now I can survive the month. KEEP IT TOGETHER! - MOM All right, I just have to return this car to the rental office, and then I'm done! Another of life's blessings. What was that? Oh, it's just a wheel stop. Phew! I was really worried there. Let's try going forward. Why? Why? A painful mistake... Um, I'm sorry. Are you all right? Quit mumbling... and get out the car.
