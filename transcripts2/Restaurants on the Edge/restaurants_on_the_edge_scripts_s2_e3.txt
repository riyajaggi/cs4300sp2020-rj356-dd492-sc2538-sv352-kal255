 [classical music playing] [Nick] We've been invited by restaurants on the edge of the most beautiful views imaginable. [Karin] Who really need some help keeping their business from going under. [Dennis] There's nothing more inspiring than celebrating a community on the plate. But far too often, the better the view, the worse the food. [Karin] This is about reviving not only the restaurants... Everything's at stake for us. For us, it's... it's life. ...but also the owners' belief in themselves. - [woman gasps] - [man whoops]

 This means the world to me. Oh, my God! [chuckles] It's like a part of us here. [Dennis] So together, we're traveling the world in search of inspiration to transform these restaurants into authentic hot spots that paint a picture not just of that restaurant, not just of that chef, but of that community. I'm telling you, my brother, you all changed my life. [Karin] What isn't there to love about Finland? The people are beautiful. The people are happy and friendly. There's nature everywhere you look. It's just a really, really gorgeous place. [Dennis] Home to the midnight sun and some of the happiest people on Earth, Finland is bordered by Sweden, Norway, and Russia.

 Our destination is the medieval town of Turku, which is now a vibrant modern city, considered a capitol of culture. [Dennis] One of the incredible things about Turku is it's surrounded by the Archipelago islands. There's 20,000 islands here. So, you get from island to island by boat. [Dennis] We're on our way to Maininki, a restaurant inside a century-old heritage building that's also home to a yacht club. The menu seems okay, but it's missing that X factor you need to entice new customers to make the 15-minute trip from Turku. [Nick] The restaurant is dealing with a perception problem. Locals assume it's for yacht club members only, but it's not. New owners, Marina and Turo, want the people of Turku to understand that their restaurant is open to anyone willing to make the trip by car or boat, because their business is falling flat. [Karin] Turo and Marina have left the interior from the previous owners, but it feels completely boring and institutional. They need help adding a modern touch to the building's already-amazing history. We wanna honor the building's heritage, but we really need to attract a younger generation. [Karin] What an interesting, old building. Lots of beautiful natural light coming in here. But it's got a little bit of a... kind of a museum feel. [Nick] Walking in Maininki, it's very quiet, very dull. The opposite of feeling the way a restaurant should feel. What's super cool about this is the round restaurant gives you complete access to this gorgeous view. It's a beautiful place, but at the same time... I need a little bit more something. Yeah, I don't know what the vibe is. I don't know, looking at this restaurant, what they serve for food here. - Feels kinda sleepy. - [Dennis] Yeah. [Karin] It could be fresh. It could be modern. It could be super cool. This architecture, the wood ceilings, these columns, I mean, I think this has a ton of potential. - [Nick] Yeah. - [Dennis] The bones are here. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Marina. - Marina, I'm Karin. - Welcome. [Karin] Marina and Turo. What a chic couple. You can tell that as soon as you meet them. They just have a quality and an air about them that is so sophisticated. We need more customers, and I hope you can help us with that. Of course, we have this spectacular view, which you cannot make it even better. - [laughs] - [Dennis] That's true. We definitely don't wanna touch the view. [laughing] [Turo] Well, we are in the Island of Ruissalo. The whole island is a natural park. I love this place. It has a soul. I can't explain. It just has a soul, somehow. If we go back 30 years ago in time, my father used to have a yacht club restaurant in Helsinki. So, it feels like I'm coming home. [Turo] So, I have also kind of, like, my own attachment to this place. We used to have a sailing boat in this yacht club, when I was young. I used to come here every single summer, many, many times. [Marina] I worked here all last summer. Marina is extremely good at her work. And I think it's a proper time for her to have something of her own. [Marina] My best wish was that I get this place for myself and do it the way I want. This is my dream come true. We're having, as a starter, smoked salmon salad. We smoked the salmon this morning in our own smoker. Should be fresh. [all laughing] And then we're having flank steak, roasted potatoes, roasted beetroot, some carrots and garnish and red wine, rosemary lemon sauce. [Dennis] This restaurant is interesting. The food is pretty good. The chef knows how to cook. The challenge is they don't know what to cook. It's too fine dining. It's not really fun. There's nothing on the menu for kids. And you come in on your boat for the afternoon with your family, this is not the food you're gonna wanna eat. Turo, what's the average age of people that are coming to the restaurant and your clientele? Well, I have to say that it's probably over 55, the average age. I would love to see more families, younger people coming over. Oftentimes, kids' menu items are secondary. There's something that you just feed them so that their bellies are full. Why? There's no reason why kids can't have a great experience at the table, too. And having food that's fun on the menu and geared to kids will help promote the younger demographic Marina and Turo are after. - Is grilling a big part of the restaurant? - I think it should be. And there are no restaurants that, at least I know, that have real barbecue in Finland. And I think that might be something that might also lure people in and also widen the demographic base of the clientele. From a design perspective, we're sitting in a beautiful building, a beautiful heritage building, but it does feel like it needs to be updated. - Yeah. - [Turo] That is correct. I hate those white lamps, because they're straight from the '80s. That's good, because I hate them, too. - Good. - [Turo] I hate them. [all laughing] Marina, what is your story with this place? I had been working here before. And the guy who owned this place, he had two places. He wanted to focus on the other one downtown. When he told me this, I was like, "Oh, my God, this is my opportunity." I've been working in a restaurant, but it's not the same thing, running the business. [Turo] Yeah, this is totally new for me. I've been in financing all my working life. I think the most important thing we have to solve, we are about seven kilometers from the city center. People have to have a reason to come over. Yeah, it's really about creating a destination restaurant. Exactly. So that is the thing. In today's world, in the restaurant business, marketing, branding, and identity are some of the most important things. I've looked at your presence online. You guys aren't promoting. What's keeping you guys from doing more online? Lack of time and resources. But the fact is that we've been concentrating getting this up and running. - Sure. - [Turo] Yeah. Just finishing dinner up, I know what my goal is for this restaurant. I need to figure out a way of driving business. How am I gonna be able to drive people from Turku to this restaurant? It's a new home to you guys and, clearly, means quite a bit not only to you guys, but people that have visited this space in the past. - Yeah. That's true. - So, we have to just figure out a way of reviving that soul and creating a new home. - [Marina] Yeah. - That's gonna feel good for everybody. And modernizing for the future, while paying respect to the heritage of this restaurant. - Exactly. - [Karin] Yeah. And there's so much expertise here now, we're just like... - [Karin] Yeah. - "Go, run, run, run." - This is really-- - Go, girl. Yeah. [all laugh] - We are out of here. - [Nick] Go, girl! [Nick] Go, girl. [Karin] Marina and Turo, they're brand new to the business. They need a launchpad. This is a heritage building, so there are some restrictions. We can't touch the outside. We can't touch the ceiling. The biggest problem here is that it looks dated. There's wood paneling on the walls, but that feels dark, and the wood paneling isn't in great condition. The lighting also looks like it doesn't totally work with the restaurant. And then the color is really flat. It's not white and minimal, it's white and sterile. No one wants to eat in a clinical, sterile restaurant. It needs to be warm, needs to be fun, and it needs to have life. It needs that "oomph" to really make it special. Let's really do a fun transformation that feels very Scandinavian and feels like it belongs in Finland. [Nick] So I'm here at a beautiful sauna here in Finland. For a population of 5.3 million people, there's actually two million saunas. It's a way of life here. So I'm happy when I asked you guys to meet me, you guys picked this location. And what a better Finnish setting than a sauna. Meeting Marina and Turo here at the saunas is a great way for me to go over their reviews with them. Some past issues that have been going on with Maininki. The restaurant business, more than any other business, puts a lot of strain on a couple. I'm married. I spend a lot of time within the restaurant. How has this business changed your relationship? Not that much. We've been working a lot in the past also. Because the history is that I hired her, I fired her, I married her. - Yeah. [laughs] - Okay. Explain that... Explain that all to me in detail. I was running a finance company in Helsinki and, uh... one of my friends said that Marina might be a good possible employee for you. And then I hired her. The one thing is that I have always a policy that you cannot date anyone you work with. So... I have to fire her first to do that. I felt like I've known him my whole life when I met him for the first time. - It didn't change when he fired you? - No. I loved him even more, because I knew that he was going to marry me. [chuckles] Okay. Marina, how important is Turo to you? He's my life. He's my twin soul. What would it mean for you guys to lose this business? It's important that... Marina and I will have something to build together to go forward with. This is a business that they're going into together. And it means that much more to them as a couple and as ambassadors to Ruissalo and Finland that they achieve the highest success possible. So, I just wanna go over this one review, from the previous owner. "The food was badly balanced and cold. It had the feeling as if it was coming through a microwave." Marina, I know you've worked there before with the previous owners. Marina actually has time invested in this business, as she worked there before as a manager. So that's something you gotta take some ownership on. Can you tell me about how you feel about that review? It doesn't feel too good. You have to take ownership for those bad experiences, unfortunately. But understand you have an opportunity - to make it better. - Yes. What would you like people to know of what you're doing now that the previous business wasn't doing? Kind of, like, handmade in Maininki. We tell that the bread is baked by ourselves. - It's not from the store. - [Nick] Mm-hmm. And we smoke the fish. And we have to promote that, because to be honest, I don't think that's enough. - No, it's not enough. - The point is that we have to tell the story to the whole world, not just the people - who are visiting the restaurant. - Yeah. My solution to their problems is to get them out there and understand how to market their business and achieve an identity, a brand in Maininki. I've got some really great ideas with this business and how to grab more attention. When you have scheduled events at your restaurant, that gives people a consistent, weekly thing to be able to do. Something new. Because the problem with Maininki is that it's always old. - That's how people perceive it. - Yeah. So we wanna create a new perception for everyone that goes into that restaurant. All right? - Right. - Great. I'm excited. You guys excited? - Yes, we are. - For sure. - [Nick] Great. - Yeah. [Dennis] After having dinner and meeting Turo and Marina, I know that they need fun in their restaurant. They need to give people a reason to make the trip out to Maininki. They need an experience, and they need to set themselves apart by adding some grilling options. Turo loves it and wants it to be a part of the restaurant's menu. I've traveled today into the Archipelago islands to meet Chef Mikko. He's run successful restaurants, and he's also a part-time musician. This guy knows what Finns love in the summertime. [Dennis] We're here working with a restaurant, Maininki, and there's some new owners. They just took over about a month ago, and the owner really wants to implement more grilled options onto the menu. Is that kind of part of food culture here in Finland, to grill at restaurants, or is that more something that's done in homes? Yeah, it's mostly done in home. Many restaurants don't have the outside areas for it. [Mikko] So, we have a topside of reindeer here. We're gonna make a reindeer sausage. We have to cut up the chanterelle and the onions, and then we're gonna sauté them. [Dennis] Nice! [sizzling] That's one of my favorite sounds in the whole world. Yeah. And then we got this seasoning, which got some fennel, some juniper berries, and black pepper. All right. - So, sausage casing. - Yes. This'll go on the end here. Sausage mixture is gonna go through this. - [Mikko] Yeah. - Bingo, bango. - It's sausage time. - Yeah. [laughs] [machine whirring] This is like... the best thing that two guys can do on their spare time. - [Dennis] Make sausage? - Yeah. [Dennis] That's one way of thinking about life. [Mikko] Yeah. So, now we just, like, grill it up. So we'll see what happens. - We grill it fast like that. - I know what's gonna happen. - Deliciousness is gonna happen. - That's for sure. [Dennis] I like sausages for this restaurant. Turo loves grilled food. They know they want that to be a part of the restaurant, because it's part of Finnish summertime. Grilling in and of itself is an experience, so I imagine sitting in the restaurant, looking at Chef outside, as I pull in on my boat, grilling some food. I can smell it already. That's an experience. You got a little sauce action going on. What's this? Basically, this is Mornay sauce. I use this Swedish cheese with it, Västerbotten cheese. It's really, really tasty. - [Dennis] Looks amazing. - Right. - I'm stoked, man. Let's eat. - All right. [Dennis] Mmm. This sausage is amazing. I'm leaving here inspired and way more set up for success to build this restaurant menu. First up, kids' food. We need to create a delicious kids' meal that's an experience, and sausage is perfect. Marina and Turo, they're a really hip couple. And we've agreed that we wanna take this restaurant, make it way more modern, fresh, vibrant, and current. So today, I'm meeting with Saana and Olli. They are a famous Finnish design duo. They live in a very unique building. It's over 100 years old, and it used to be a schoolhouse. Wow. What a beautiful place to live. I think this is the most beautiful place in Finland I've been to so far. [Olli and Saana] Thank you. - [Karin] Yeah. - [Saana] Thank you so much. [Karin] Because it's such an old building, Saana and Olli have taken it, and they've revived it. They've renovated the house and made it more modern. And I think there's lots of things about their renovation practices and this house that I can bring back to the restaurant. Wow! [Karin] Oh, my goodness. This is room number one. I'm so excited. This is beautiful. - [Saana] Welcome to our house. - [Karin] Oh, my gosh. And all these panels are the originals, but we wanted to paint them in these classic shades, to have this Nordic style, but just a little. Yeah. We wanted to have the... Honor the heritage of this building. The house is older than Finland as a nation, so... [Karin] Well, I love all the textiles. These must be yours. [Olli] They are our own collection. We produce these. All of textiles are 100% hemp fabric. [Saana] All the carpets are also our designs. - And these are made from recycled cotton. - [Karin] This is yours. No way! Wow. Wait. What is this? [Olli] This is, uh, original 105-year-old wallpaper. [Karin] What? - It's so beautiful. - All right. Thank you. Even though it's in rough shape, we wanted to keep the history exposed and shown in here. I love the wallpaper. I love using wallpaper. I'm thinking maybe I should use some wallpaper in the restaurant. - [Olli] Oh, that sounds good. - [Karin] Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. [Karin] Seeing this house, I have a new appreciation for Scandinavian design. The colors inspire a sense of calm. And the use of plants, it feels so healthy, like you just wanna hang out. And how could you not be happy in an environment like this? Yeah, I really love it. [Dennis] Right in the center of Turku, there is an incredible bakery named Fika. You wanna talk about an experience at a restaurant and creating memorable moments at the table, there's nothing like dessert. And I need to bring in that experience to Maininki, so that people leave with a little sweet after they eat, feeling like they had a memorable experience. Cool. So what are we making here? I can teach you how to make Archipelago bread. That's the most Finn thing that you can make. - The most Finnish thing? - The most, yes. - Yes. - So what goes in this bread? Dark syrup, orange juice, rye flour, dry malt, wheat flour and barley oats. - Yeah. - [Dennis] There's a lot going on in here. - Yes. - Super dense, I'm assuming. It is super dense and moist and sweet. - But we're done here. - Good. That's easy. [Krista] Yeah, it is. It's so easy. [Dennis] And is this a bread that people make at home as well? - Yeah. - Yeah? It's so easy. Like you just throw everything in a bowl and mix it, and you're done. Right. And then you have it for breakfast, you have it for lunch. Even night snack. - This is Finland, pretty much. - This is Finland. That Archipelago bread kinda blew my mind, honestly. I've never had bread like this before. What I love about it is you can use it in 16,000 ways. It's great for savory dishes. It's great for sweet dishes or just with butter and by itself. So I wanna learn what the most summertime, summer fresh dessert is here in Finland. Let me tell you. Brita cake. What is in Brita? So we're gonna build it from dough and then a meringue on top. And we're gonna bake it, and then we're gonna fill it up with whipped cream and berries. - Looks beautiful. Smells beautiful. - It does. I know. There you go. That's your Brita. - You want me to feed it to you? - Yes. Is this a service you offer at the bakery? - Yeah. - Really? [laughing] - It's perfect. It's delicious. - [Krista] It is. I told you. - [Dennis] Yeah. - It's so good. So I've learned a few things today. Number one, Archipelagoesblah. Nope, that's not... I learned about cakes. I learned about berries. I learned about bread that are all native to this part of Finland. I think more than that, I learned that Finnish people are just awesome. [Karin] Saana and Olli have done a beautiful job renovating their century-old house. They kept the character, but made it modern by including their own textile designs. - [Karin] So, this is your kitchen. - [Saana] Yes. - Gorgeous. - This was the first room we got finished. It's beautiful. I love the grey, the white ceiling and the wood floor. It's very calming and serene. But there's still a lot of character in your home. - Oi. - Olli and Saana are the cutest. Oi. Speaking of your fabrics, I'm excited to take a look at them. Oi, Saana can show them. Yes. We can show you. We have some samples. So, this is like the natural color of the hemp - when it's not colored or dyed. - Okay. It's called Ikiaika, which means, like, the eternal. And it was inspired by the cave paintings found in Finland. There you can see some other color options, like the black and white in the same prints. We are really interested in folk and craft history of Finland. So that has a major influence in all of our collections. [Saana] This one is called "Land of Happiness." [Karin] I love that this is called Land of Happiness, because Finland definitely feels like the land of happiness. - [Karin laughs] - Oi. [chuckles] It's beautiful, the food is good, the design is amazing. People are happy and friendly. It's definitely the land of happiness. - [chuckles] - Oi. I haven't totally decided how I'm gonna bring those textiles in yet, but I just know I love the idea of bringing the fabric in. As Finnish designers, what is Scandinavian design? What does that mean to you? I think it's something, like, inspired by the surroundings and natural materials and... - [Olli] And the four seasons. - Yeah. That cycle has a big influence in Finnish lifestyle, I think. Finland is 85% forest, the whole country. So, that has a major influence in our design, too. After seeing this house, I'm actually inspired to go more Scandinavian in my designs all the time. [chuckles] Not just with this restaurant, but all the time. It's really beautiful. [singing in Finnish] [Nick] So, I just arrived in the beautiful seaside town of Naantali, which is one of the coolest places I've ever been. But not only that, we're here during the best time of the year. It's the midsummer festival. It's an ancient holiday that celebrates the arrival of summer after a long, dark winter. In Finland, they kick it off officially with a long weekend. And it's an excuse for you to drink, dance, eat, and just have fun. It's a perfect time to give Marina and Turo a crash course on guerrilla-style marketing. I have some very exciting news I wanna share with you guys. The problem with Maininki is that no one knows it's there. So, my solution to that problem is creating a relaunch party. I created a flyer for you guys, and it's for the official relaunch party of Maininki. We're gonna hand out these invites, and get the buzz going. - There's gonna be a live band. - That's great. - I think that-- - There's never been live music there. - No. - [Nick] Yeah. - [Nick] Never been live music? - Never. That'll bring us younger generation to the restaurant, which is extremely important for future success. There's nothing better than grassroots guerilla marketing. When you actually put something tangible in somebody's hand, and you add a little treat to it, that's something that people remember. So let's walk around town. Let's talk to people. And let's build up a buzz. Let's do that. - [Marina] Let's do that. - There we go. [Turo] Let's do it. This is definitely something I've applied to my own businesses in the past. And I don't care how successful you are, you gotta get your feet out in the street and you gotta connect with your community. [Turo] Let's do this. Hi, guys. How are you? Hi, I'm Nick. Um, we're, uh... We're actually promoting a new restaurant that we're gonna be reopening. [woman] Okay. This is the official relaunch. - We are... I'm at work, actually. - You're working. - Yeah. - Okay. She's running away. You're not going anywhere. Come over here, guys. Are you guys local? - [woman] No. - [Nick] No. Okay. - [woman] We're from Stockholm. - [Nick] Okay. You're from Stockholm. You pay to travel. We are gladly coming back on Wednesday. [Nick] Live band, great music. This is a free drink ticket, so you definitely wanna bring it. This is your invitation to come. - [Turo] You're underage. - Yeah. Under 18. Well, we have a kids' menu. [Nick] Hey, gentlemen, how are you? Can I get a quick moment to talk to you? - No, I don't have time. - No? Okay. All right. That's okay. It's okay. Perfectly fine. I definitely feel like Turo and Marina were a little held back when I was just walking up to strangers, because that's not something that's commonly done around here. [Nick] For companies in Finland, the use of social media and digital advertising are on the rise. But when it comes to guerilla marketing, it's usually used by big companies, not small business owners. I had to get them engaged. I had to really almost grab Turo's hand and say, "Talk to this guy." And, "Marina, talk to her." - Okay. Let's talk to all these people. - Yeah. [Nick] But then as we started going throughout the night, I think Marina and Turo started to loosen up. Free drinks, live music. Please join us on Wednesday at six o'clock. - [Turo] She's missing the candy. - [Nick] There you go. [Turo] You'll see, you'll see... [speaks Finnish] [all laughing] [Nick] I wish I knew what he said. It sounded fun. It started a little bumpy, but then as we started going throughout the night, people kind of started getting used to seeing us walk around town and really wanted to find out what we were handing out. [Karin] Today, I'm meeting with Brian Keaney. And he is the artist behind Tonfisk, one of the most successful Scandinavian brands here in Finland. Are you the artist behind all of this? Not all of it, but I'm founder of the company, yes. And also main designer in the company. - I like your accent. - Oh, thank you. [both laugh] - You're Irish. - Irish originally, yeah. Okay. Okay. Cool. - Adopted Finn now, at this stage. - Adopted Finn. I can hear it. - So this is beautiful stuff. - [Brian] Yeah. [Karin] As a designer, my first impression of the product is they're so simple. But they're beautiful, and they're simple. In Finland, in particular, people are, kind of, very no nonsense. I think maybe the design philosophy that carries through that Finnish design, compared to maybe the other Nordic design, is even more pared down, even simpler. Traditionally, it has been, than the other Nordic designs even. - So this is a creamer. - [Brian] Creamer, yeah. Milk and sugar. So you pour the milk... - [Karin] This is very clever. - Yeah. - Because the sugar just stays in there. - [Brian] It just stays there. It revolves around inside. - So... - I love that. - And, of course, we do-- - You must sell a lot of these. We do, yeah. Yeah. [both laugh] [Karin] What I learned today about Finnish design is that it's really about what is essential. Finding simple solutions to problems. That's what Finnish design is all about. Okay, so we're gonna do the cups and the teapots. So, these are the molds made from plaster. So then all we do is we pour the clay into the molds. So, they'll stay there now for about 10, 15 minutes. I didn't expect that when he was gonna show me his process and the production, that they're handmade. They look like they're factory machine-made. Do you wanna have a go? Yeah. [Brian chuckles] So, grab it on the lower part of it there, like this. - [Karin] The lower part. - Yes. And then just enough so it stays in your hand, and then just lift it up 'cause it's quite soft still at the moment. That's it. - There you go. - [Karin] Okay. So on Monday morning, nine o'clock, I expect to see you here. - Okay. For work, yeah. [laughs] - For work, yeah. Here we are, finishing some pieces. So, we just need some water or a sponge, for example, with the cups here. [Karin] Okay. Whoop! [Brian laughs] And so, this is quite normal for people doing it the first time. - I feel bad that I broke one. - No, no, no. - It's just... - Okay. Don't worry. There's thousands more from where that came from. [Karin] We've been doing this. I've been really thinking about the creamers. And the creamers have just stuck in my mind. I just think it would be perfect to have those creamers on the tables. Sure. Yeah, we can see what we can do, yeah. - [Karin] Yeah? - Yeah. That was very cool. Very, very, very cool. I'm even more excited about Finnish design than I was when I got here. And I'm thinking a lot about that and how I'm gonna take that philosophy back to the restaurant with me. [Nick] I'm getting Marina and Turo out of their comfort zone to do some guerilla marketing to a younger demographic about the relaunch of their restaurant, and we also need to get the word out that Maininki is not just for yacht club members. How you doing? I'm Nick. Nice to meet you. My name is Nick, and this is Turo and Marina. This is Turo and Marina. - [Turo] How're you doing? - They're restaurant owners. It's a relaunch to a restaurant that we're rebranding. We're having a big party on Wednesday night at 6:00 p.m. And we're gonna have live music, cocktails, food. So, it's very close. 6:00 p.m. It's gonna be the biggest, best party in town. - Whoo! - [women] Whoo! - Happy midsummer! - [man] That's good. [Nick] These are free drink tickets. Hey, what's up, girls? How are you? - [woman] Oh, free booze. - [Nick] Party. Yes, yes, yes. Free booze. - [woman] Thank you. - [Nick] Do you like parties? - [woman 1] Yeah. - [woman 2] Of course, we do. Happy midsummer. - [woman speaking Finnish] - [Nick exclaiming] You guys into it? [man] I would like to take one of those. [Nick] This guy wants to party. - You know it. - [man] Party animal! [Nick] That's right. Party animal. Wednesday night, 6:00 p.m. - [Turo] Perfect. - [Nick] Perfect. - [Turo] You'll be there. - Yeah. [man] Thank you. - [Nick] There we go. - Thank you. - [woman cheers] - Yeah! We're gonna have the most epic party of the year. - [all laugh] - That's right. Party. - All right. - I'm coming. - You're coming. Check. - Awesome. - Alrighty then. - Alrighty. - Guys. - That was cool. - Whoop! - We handed out the whole basket. - I think the reception was really good. - Yeah. And I really think most of the people will come there on Wednesday and spread the word. I truly feel that Marina and Turo had a great time with me walking around town. It gave them an opportunity to get back in touch with their community and have everyone appreciate Maininki in a new light. [upbeat music playing] [Karin] It's good to see you guys. I've had such an incredible time in Finland. I can only imagine the experience that you guys have had, 'cause it's pretty amazing here. Just getting involved with the Finnish culture. These were some of the nicest people I've ever met in the world. And speaking of nice people, I got some time to spend with Marina and Turo. I actually went to a sauna with them to get them out of the restaurant setting and get to know them a little bit better. He's so strong in finance, and she's such a great person in the restaurant business. But the one thing that they're lacking is they're terrible at marketing. So, what I decided, I think, is gonna be great for us, is actually creating a relaunch party. And the strategy I used was actually something that's not used here in Finland. Just walking around, shaking hands, talking to people, walking into bars. What I thought would be great with you, Dennis, is I would love for you to get Turo or Marina, showing them and inspiring them new ways to take pictures of food. Definitely. I feel like social media is the biggest marketing tool today. - Mm-hmm. It's free. - Yeah. You can highlight the best of what you have to offer. So, what have we got going with design? Oh, my gosh. I have so much to tell you guys. I've had such an amazing, life-changing experience when it comes to design. When people talk about Scandinavian design, now I know what they're talking about. - Do you want some cream in your coffee? - [Nick] Sure. - This is cool, right? Did you notice this? - [Nick] Very cool. - Did you not notice what just happened? - I'm seeing it right now. [Karin] Tonfisk is the company that makes this, and Brian is the artist and the craftsperson behind the company. He's always thinking about coming up with a solution to a problem for these products. In the restaurant, I thought these creamers would be great for the tables. - Love it. - Kind of getting it away from the dated character that it has. Now, the other thing that I did is, I went to meet with this design power couple, Saana and Olli. They're best known for textiles. And they live in the most gorgeous house. I mean, it is the epitome of Scandinavian design. And what I loved about it so much is that it really reflected this transformation at the restaurant that we're going to do, because the restaurant is in an old building with tons of character. But we wanna make it more modern and keeping it true to its Scandinavian roots. So, it was the perfect house to go see for inspiration. So, while Saana and Olli were renovating, they actually stumbled on some wallpaper that was original to the building. And that really inspired me to incorporate some wallpaper into the restaurant. So along with this wallpaper, I really wanted to use some paint, because that wood paneling has gotta go. Marina doesn't like it. It also feels weathered. It feels a little heavy. It feels tired. 'Cause that restaurant has huge windows, lots of natural light spilling in, we need to bring in some blinds for when it gets really sunny. But just layering in some paint, some fresh wallpaper, some hemp textiles from Saana and Olli, and some tabletop items from Tonfisk, I think this whole place is gonna feel current, up-to-date, vibrant, Scandinavian, fresh, and bright. I just wanna give you some more cream, 'cause I just like pouring this thing. Well, I'm just drinking milk now. There's no more coffee. [both chuckle] People here have a connection to where their food comes from, honestly, unlike most countries in the world. They really care. And I got to connect with a baker here. We made this Archipelago bread. This is Finland on the plate. This bread is beautiful. And it shouldn't be a secondary side note, kind of, after-thought on the table. It should be the star of the show. So I wanna create a sandwich board with cold and hot smoked fish, great veggies, some nice pickles on that. It feels like Scandinavia. We also made a cake, a really traditional Finnish cake. That dessert was incredible that I had, and I wanna do my spin on the dessert that I made with Krista, the baker. Kind of a lemony, fruity-flavored base, meringue on top. We're gonna blowtorch the outside of the meringue and serve it with these beautiful tart berries on the side. I actually got to travel out to the Archipelago islands and meet Chef Mikko. He's a local chef here in Turku, runs a catering company, has run successful restaurants. We cooked right on the edge of the water. It was beautiful. Everything smoked, everything over a grill. And we made reindeer sausage. There are endless kinds of sausage that people make here. The big thing is, it just comes down to folks like to grill. That's the thing that's missing at the restaurant right now. And Turo even said that, at that meal. He said, "I want more grilled food. I want more accessible food. And I want more food that feels like the summertime." I'm gonna create for the restaurant a kids' dish, something that's really, really fun with sausage, some fries that are beautiful from the new potatoes that people love here. All of it plated up in an ice cube tray. It's something that you're gonna wanna take a photo of, put on the Internet, tell your friends. And it will drive people to the restaurant to wanna have that meal. You know what I love about this transformation is that it feels hyper local. It's so connected to the community. The food, the design, throwing a party. We've got a lot of work to do. Let's get out of here. [upbeat music playing] [Nick] I gave Marina and Turo a crash course in guerilla marketing the other day. And today, I'm here at Auran Aallot, which is a great radio station that grabs a lot of listeners, to get the buzz out about Maininki and the relaunch party. [speaking Finnish] - Nick Liberato, welcome. - Thank you so much for having me. Great that you could come here. And we gonna talk about food, of course, and Ruissalon Maininki, that great big relaunch party. I don't wanna reveal too much because we wanna keep it a surprise. In today's world, you have to diversify how you're gonna reach people. [Nick] The radio actually reaches a whole different audience, people that are in their cars, people that are sitting at bus stops. We're gonna do everything we can to bring a new audience into the restaurant. Right now, this is place is completely being changed over. So when everyone's going to be coming on Wednesday night, which is tomorrow night at 6:00 p.m., they're gonna be experiencing a new drink, you know, new food, new decor. - [radio host] Live music? - And live music. And a revival of this place like no one's ever seen. - That's great. - Yeah. Nick, thanks for visiting our show. - Thank you so much for having me. - Thanks for visiting. And don't be a stranger. I think it's great that we got free marketing from a local broadcaster that actually grabs the attention of a number of listeners every single day. There are definitely gonna be some that listened today, and they're going to be showing up at tomorrow's party. [Karin] Walking into the restaurant today, it's not complete yet, and already it is such a huge transformation. High, high, high impact. What I've learned in Finland is that design is all about freshening up the space, making it light, airy, bringing in light, speaking to nature. I mean, that's very Finn. My only concern is that I really want Marina and Turo to love it. When we first got here, Marina and Turo were struggling with a perception problem. People weren't making the trip out to the restaurant, because they assumed it was a yacht club that was exclusive, formal, and that you wanted to button up another button in your shirt. [laughs] This transformation has set them on a new path, and their future is about to begin. - [both laughing] - Wow! [both laughing] [Turo] Wow. [Turo] Amazing. - [Turo chuckles] - [Marina] Whoo. [Turo] Amazing. Wow. Look at these. This is amazing. It's so fresh. Look at the lights. I'm speechless. - [Turo] What a place we have. - [Marina] Oh, my God. [Turo] Yeah. - Yeah. - Is it the same place? [chuckles] It is. It is the same place. - [crying] No way. - Yeah. [laughs] - [Marina] Yeah. - [Turo] It's really great. [Karin] Hello. - Hi, Karin. - Hi, there. Wow. - Oh, my God. - Look at you. Oh. [Marina] Oh. [Turo] Thank you so much. - [Marina] Whoa. - [Karin] How are you feeling? [sighs] - [Turo] Speechless? - Speechless. Yeah. - Overwhelmed? - I'm really overwhelmed. - [Turo] Yeah. This is so... - [Marina] Not in my wildest dreams. Yeah. - [Marina] You did magic to this place. - [Karin] Really? - You did. - My heart is thumping. - I'm getting a heart attack. - You definitely did. Yeah. [Marina] All the blue and all the grey and all the white, it's so Finnish. - We love it. - We love it. - [Turo] It's amazing. - [Marina] Oh, thank you. - [Turo] It's amazing. - Oh, you're so welcome. [Nick] We handed out these invites, which were drink tickets, and everyone can redeem 'em. And I have a wonderful cocktail that we put together. It's called the Midsummer Rumble. It's made with one and a half ounces Ketel One vodka, three quarters lime juice, three quarters simple syrup, with some muddled blackberries on top. [Dennis] What's up, everybody? - [all] Hey. - How are we doing? - [Karin] Great. - Look at how perfectly that's plated. That looks beautiful. [Dennis] I bet you weren't expecting this. - You guys want families? - [Turo] Yeah. - [Marina] Yeah. - You need to offer food to kids. And potatoes, reindeer sausage, some carrots. Kids wanna have fun when they eat. 'Cause when kids are having fun, parents are having fun, everybody's happy. So the thing about making kids' food is you want it to be interactive. You want it to be fun. And you're gonna notice I've said "fun" a lot, 'cause "fun" is the theme - for this evening. - Yeah. - Yeah. - All about making it fun. And I know we had talked about Instagram a little bit and social media, and you guys are just starting with your social media. I know a thing or two about social media. I'd love to help you if I can. So, here's the thing with food. You eat with your eyes and then your nose and then your mouth. When you look at a photograph, subconsciously, we look at it from the top left-hand corner to the bottom right hand corner, right? If you know that, you can draw the viewer's eye through the frame. And see what I mean, when you look at that, how there's things peeking through the frame? - So that looks super fun. You know? - [Karin] Cute. [Dennis] All right, next up, ready for more fun? Okay. What do we have here? Essentially, this is a charcuterie board, but it's a sandwich version. It's fun. I've literally never seen anyone do this before. Beautiful salmon that was smoked on your smoker back there. Perch, which I know is very, very popular and also, everywhere in the water that we're looking at right here. That is so true. We've got come quick pickles, Archipelago bread, beautiful herbed mayo here, celebrating dill, tarragon, all the things they grow out here that are beautiful. Entirely customizable. Can I taste one? We need to take a picture first, because once we start eating, we're not gonna stop. [Marina laughs] - [Turo] Shall we put the hands in there? - [Dennis] Yes. That's very fun. [Karin] I like you. You're art directing now. [Dennis] Yeah. [Turo] Dennis, I'm speechless. This is really good. It's like a small buffet, but this is a modern, fresh way to do it. So, I have one more thing. There's nothing to complete a meal like a little sweet after you eat. [Karin] Dennis, I think this is the most beautiful thing you've ever made. [Dennis] Absolutely. You know, and I fell head first into Brita. - I hope I'm pronouncing that properly. - Yeah. The beautiful cake that you guys know, I'm sure, and love. So this is kind of my version of that, a deconstructed Brita cake. [Marina] This is absolutely gorgeous. All the flavors together. You really nailed it. And you brought the food up to a new level completely. We sit in this beautiful... restaurant, which had a really, really huge change if we compare. It will make a huge difference to the customer experience. I can guarantee you that. - Let's celebrate you guys tonight. - [Marina] Yes, celebrate. - [Turo] Yes, let's do it. - It is time to party. [Karin] This new design reflects them, who they are as people and as a couple. And it's Finnish. Everything in this room is from Finland. That's what people in Finland like. [Nick] I truly believe that Marina and Turo have been set up for success. They have all the positivity, initiative, and creativity to make this place the best restaurant around here. [Dennis] Maininki now has a new direction. This restaurant has its soul back. It's an experience. People wanna Instagram it. And it is what's gonna drive people to the restaurant from Turku. They have their new vision. They have a new direction. [upbeat music playing] [theme music playing] Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
