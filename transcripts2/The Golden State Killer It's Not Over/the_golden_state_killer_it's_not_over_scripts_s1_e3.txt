 FROM 1976 TO 1986, HE RAPED 50 WOMEN AND KILLED 10 PEOPLE, MAYBE MORE. THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT, UNSOLVED RAPE-MURDER SERIES IN CALIFORNIA IF NOT IN THIS COUNTRY. WHEN THE HORRIFIC SPREE STARTED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, HE WAS KNOWN AS "THE EAST AREA RAPIST." HALF OF THOSE ATTACKS INVOLVED COUPLES. SO, IF YOU COUNT EVERYBODY, YOU HAVE 75 ADULT VICTIMS. AFTER THREE YEARS, HIS PATH TURNS DOWN SOUTH, WHERE HIS M.O. CHANGES.

 FOUR OF THE CASES ARE DOUBLE HOMICIDES. THE MAGNITUDE OF HIS CRIME WAS JUST AMAZING. AT FIRST, NO ONE KNOWS THE SEXUAL ASSAULTS AND MURDERS ARE CONNECTED. BUT IN 2001, DNA CONNECTS THEM TO THE SAME MAN. IT TURNED AN UNSOLVED RAPE SERIES INTO A SERIAL-KILLING MURDER CASE THAT SPANNED 10 YEARS. NOW KNOWN AS "THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER," THE PERP IS THE TARGET OF A RELENTLESS STATEWIDE MANHUNT THAT IS UNCOVERING NEW EVIDENCE... I PULL UP THAT PLASTIC BAG, AND IT'S THREE PIECES OF TORN, SPIRAL-BOUND NOTEBOOK PAPER. ...AND DEVELOPING NEW LEADS... THIS IS A VERY CRUDELY DRAWN

 RIGHT AND LEFT ELEVATION OF A TWO-STORY HOUSE. ...PUSHING INVESTIGATORS EVER CLOSER TO BRINGING CLOSURE TO THIS INFAMOUS CASE. THIS IS MY HOUSE RIGHT HERE. THIS HOUSE HERE IS THE HOUSE THAT IS BLACKENED OUT ON THE DIAGRAM. THE ANSWER'S OUT THERE. IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF OUR PASSION AND PERSISTENCE IN FINDING IT. ONE DAY IN MARCH OF 1978, A YOUNG MAN REALIZES THAT THE LOCK ON THE DOOR LEADING FROM HIS GARAGE INTO HIS HOME HAS BEEN BROKEN. TWO DAYS LATER, HE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND ARE AWOKEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BY A MAN POINTING A FLASHLIGHT DIRECTLY IN THEIR EYES. WITH THIS OFFENDER, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY STANDS OUT IS THAT THE ATTACKS INCLUDED MALES PRESENT. HOW MANY OTHER SERIAL RAPISTS OUT THERE ARE PURPOSELY ATTACKING AND BINDING UP THE MALE PARTNER OF THE FEMALE? THE INTRUDER TELLS THE COUPLE HE NEEDS MONEY. HE THROWS SHOELACES IN THEIR DIRECTION AND INSTRUCTS THE WOMAN TO TIE UP THE MAN, AND THEN TIES THE WOMAN'S HANDS TOGETHER HIMSELF. THEN HE RUMMAGES THROUGH THE HOUSE, PRESUMABLY LOOKING FOR MONEY AND FOOD. - HE'S GOT CONTROL OVER THEM. - HE'S GOT THE POWER OVER THEM. GOT THEM BOUND INSIDE THE HOUSE, AND HE'S OUTSIDE, SITTING ON THEIR LAWN CHAIR, DRINKING A BEER, AND EATING CHEEZ-ITS. WHEN HE RETURNS, THE REAL TORTURE BEGINS. HE BALANCES DINNER PLATES ON THE MAN'S BACK AND TELLS HIM THAT IF HE HEARS HIM MOVE, HE'LL KILL HIS GIRLFRIEND. IT'S A CHILLING TECHNIQUE THAT'S A CLASSIC PART OF THE EAST AREA RAPIST'S M.O. HE LEADS THE WOMAN OUT OF THE ROOM AND RAPES HER SEVERAL TIMES, AND AS A RESULT, BOTH THE MAN AND THE WOMAN BECOME HIS VICTIMS. FROM THE OFFENDER'S PERSPECTIVE, WHAT'S THE WORST WAY YOU CAN GET AT THAT GUY? YOU GO AFTER HIS LOVED ONE IN FRONT OF HIM. RAPE HIS LOVED ONE WHILE YOU'RE BOUND IN BED. AT THE TIME OF THIS RAPE, HE WAS KNOWN AS THE EAST AREA RAPIST. TODAY, DETECTIVES ARE STILL ON THE HUNT FOR HIM. I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS GUY VERY LIKELY IS STILL ALIVE, AND HE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS SHOWN THAT HE WILL RE-CONTACT VICTIMS. AFTER WORKING THE CASE FOR OVER TWO DECADES, COLD-CASE INVESTIGATOR PAUL HOLES KNOWS BETTER THAN ANYONE WHAT THIS PERP IS CAPABLE OF. IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF HE HAS FOLLOWED SOME OF THESE VICTIMS. MOST CERTAINLY, HE'S SOMEBODY THAT WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. FOR SACRAMENTO NATIVE, DISTRICT ATTORNEY ANNE MARIE SCHUBERT, THE THOUGHT OF THE KILLER LIVING IN HER CITY HAUNTS HER EVERY DAY. I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT THE GUY STANDING IN FRONT OF ME AT THE GROCERY STORE IS NOT THE GUY THAT DID THIS. IT'S A COMMON FEAR. I'VE BEEN LAYING AWAKE AT NIGHT IN MY OWN HOUSE. I'M GOING, "DOES HE KNOW I'M GOING AFTER HIM? AND IF HE DOES KNOW, WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO?" YOU KNOW? AND I THINK ALL THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE WHERE THIS OFFENDER IS SOMEBODY THAT, I THINK, DUE TO SELF-PRESERVATION AND HIS CAPABILITIES, YOU GUYS START BEING CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR OWN PERSONAL SAFETY AS AN INVESTIGATOR. I THINK THAT'S THE SCARY THING. PAUL HOLES RECENTLY UNCOVERED EVIDENCE FOUND NEAR A CRIME SCENE THAT HAS FOCUSED HIS INVESTIGATION. I NOW BELIEVE THAT THIS DIAGRAM WAS DRAWN BY SOMEBODY WHO IS SOMEHOW AFFILIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT, BUILDING, REAL-ESTATE INDUSTRY. THE MAP ISN'T PAUL'S ONLY CLUE. IN 1978, AFTER HITTING SACRAMENTO FOR TWO YEARS, THE EAST AREA RAPIST MOVES 50 MILES SOUTH TO STOCKTON FOR ATTACKS 23 AND 30. YOU DO SEE, ONCE HE MOVES OUT OF SACRAMENTO, THAT THERE'S A PREVALENCE OF ATTACKS OCCURRING IN OR IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION LOCATIONS. AND SO. A THEORY -- AND IT'S JUST A THEORY -- BUT A THEORY IS THAT HE'S BEING DRAWN TO SOME OF THESE LOCATIONS BECAUSE OF THAT PARTICULAR CONSTRUCTION. AND THERE'S MORE. AS PAUL DISSECTS THE DIAGRAM EVEN FURTHER, HE REALIZES IT DEPICTS A UNIQUE LAKE-CENTRIC COMMUNITY, MUCH LIKE THE ONES BEING BUILT IN STOCKTON IN 1978. ANOTHER LOOK AT ATTACK NUMBER 30 IN STOCKTON STRENGTHENS PAUL'S DEVELOPMENT THEORY EVEN MORE. AND IN THAT ATTACK, THE HUSBAND, WHO WAS ALSO A VICTIM, HAD TOLD THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATORS THAT HIS WIFE USED TO GO OUT TO CONSTRUCTION-JOB SITES ALL THE TIME. COULD THE RAPIST HAVE CONNECTIONS WITH THE STOCKTON DEVELOPMENT WORLD? WITH THAT, DAY TO DAY WHAT I'M DOING IS I'M LOOKING AT, "OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON IN STOCKTON AROUND THE LOCATIONS OF THOSE ATTACKS? ARE THERE NEW DEVELOPMENTS BEING BUILT? WHO'S BUILDING THOSE?" I'M LOOKING THROUGH THEIR ARCHIVES TRYING TO GET INFORMATION AS TO WHAT ARCHITECTS WERE INVOLVED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT?. WHAT ENGINEERING FIRMS? WHO WAS THE DEVELOPER? IN ADDITION TO GATHERING DATA, PAUL HAS ALSO FORGED RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE WHO WORKED IN DEVELOPMENT IN STOCKTON AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACKS. WE'RE GONNA GO SEE THIS WOMAN WHO IS SOMEBODY THAT WORKED FOR A MAJOR DEVELOPER BACK IN THE 1970s OUT HERE IN STOCKTON. PAUL'S SOURCE STILL LIVES IN STOCKTON IN A LAKE-CENTRIC COMMUNITY NEAR THE LOCATION OF ONE OF THE ATTACKS. - HEY, HOW YOU DOING? - HEY! HOW ARE YOU? - YEAH, IT'S BEEN A WHILE. - GOOD TO SEE YOU. SHE WANTS TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS AS SHE DOES HAVE CONCERNS SINCE SHE WAS SO ENTRENCHED IN THE DEVELOPMENT ARENA THAT SHE'S CONCERNED ABOUT SOME EXPOSURE AND POTENTIALLY, IF THE OFFENDER'S STILL ALIVE, HIM SEEING HER TALKING TO ME. - YOU GOT FISH IN THE LAKE. - I DO. SOMETIMES THEY'RE THIS BIG. REALLY? NOW, DO THEY ACTUALLY -- THEY STOCK THEM. DO THEY REALLY? YEAH. SO, THE ATTACK OCCURRED -- THAT DIRECTION. THAT DIRECTION OVER THERE, SO, IT'S ON THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE LAKE. YES. WERE ALL THESE HOUSES BUILT AT THAT TIME? NO. NO. SO, AT THAT TIME, THERE WAS STILL ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION GOING ON? YEAH, LOTS AND LOTS. IN FACT, WHERE WE'RE STANDING AT RIGHT NOW WASN'T BUILT. OKAY. AND SO, PLANNING WAS STILL GOING ON. CONSTRUCTION WAS STILL ACTIVE. ABSOLUTELY. THE EAST AREA RAPIST, IF HE'S INVOLVED IN THE BUILDING TRADE, HE COULD HAVE LITERALLY HAD A JOB SITE OUT HERE. ABSOLUTELY. PAUL'S GOAL IS TO CONFIRM HIS THEORY THAT THE DIAGRAM COULD BE A MATCH TO A NEIGHBORHOOD IN STOCKTON. WHEN WE START LOOKING AT THIS DIAGRAM, WHAT I'M SEEING TO MY EYES, IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A COMMERCIAL AREA, WE HAVE A RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND THEN UNDEVELOPED AREAS OF CUL-DE-SACS, AND THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS SURROUND A LAKE. I BELIEVE, IN THE 1970s, WE HAD AT LEAST THREE, POSSIBLY FOUR LAKES, AND ANOTHER ONE UNDER DEVELOPMENT AT THAT TIME. YOU THINK THAT THIS DIAGRAM WAS DEFINITELY INSPIRED BY THE TYPES OF DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE GOING ON HERE. I DO. I CERTAINLY DO. AT THE TIME OF THE ATTACK, PAUL'S INFORMANT LIVED IN ANOTHER LAKE-CENTRIC COMMUNITY IN STOCKTON. SHE IS A RELIABLE SOURCE AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THIS CASE. THAT WAS MY HOUSE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE IT SAT IN RELATIONSHIP TO THIS VERY TINY, LITTLE LAKE. WAS THIS WOMAN A POTENTIAL TARGET? DID HER CONNECTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT WORLD PUT HER AT RISK? SO, WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WAS AFTER THE FIRST ATTACK HERE IN STOCKTON, STOCKTON P.D. WORKED WITH CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL AND THEIR HELICOPTER, AND THEY WENT UP, AND THEY TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE WHOLE GENERAL AREA. THIS IS MY HOUSE RIGHT HERE. RIGHT THERE? YOU FEEL THAT THIS HOUSE HERE IS THE HOUSE THAT IS BLACKENED OUT ON THE DIAGRAM? I DO. IT TURNS OUT, THE INFORMANT'S HOME WAS PART OF A BRAND-NEW DEVELOPMENT AT THE TIME. AND IN SEPTEMBER OF 1977, HOW LONG HAD YOU BEEN LIVING IN THAT HOUSE? ABOUT SIX MONTHS. AS WE WERE MOVING INTO THE HOUSE, AFTER THE HOUSE WAS FINISHED BEING BUILT, WE WERE BURGLARIZED. AND I DON'T REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT WAS STOLEN. I DO REMEMBER THAT MY HUSBAND'S WEDDING RING WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS STOLEN. EVER SINCE YOU'VE SHOWN ME THIS MAP, I'VE BEEN BASICALLY CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS THE SUBDIVISION WHERE I LIVED. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION IN MY MIND TO THIS MINUTE THAT I SIT HERE WITH YOU -- IT'S VENETIAN GARDENS. GO BACK TO VENETIAN GARDENS. AND THE DEVELOPER OF VENETIAN GARDENS WAS...? ECKHARD SCHMITZ, CHILD PREDATOR. INVESTIGATOR PAUL HOLES IS WORKING A LEAD THAT THE EAST AREA RAPIST WAS INVOLVED IN RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA, IN THE LATE 1970s. AFTER THE HOUSE WAS FINISHED BEING BUILT, WE WERE BURGLARIZED. AFTER LEARNING THAT ONE OF HIS INFORMANTS MAY HAVE BEEN A POTENTIAL TARGET FOR THE RAPIST, PAUL IS REMINDED THAT THE MAN WHO DEVELOPED HER NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ECKHARD SCHMITZ. IN 1983, SCHMITZ WAS EXPOSED FOR HAVING INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH TEENAGE BOYS. HE WAS CONVICTED OF CHILD MOLESTATION AND SENTENCED TO 13 YEARS IN PRISON, BUT SCHMITZ WOULD NEVER SERVE HIS TIME. HE WAS RELEASED ON BAIL AND FLED THE COUNTRY TO HIS NATIVE GERMANY. SO, AND I ACTUALLY LOOKED INTO ECKHARD SCHMITZ. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, SCHMITZ IS STILL A FUGITIVE-AT-LARGE, BUT PAUL WAS ABLE TO TRACK HIM DOWN. IT TURNS OUT SCHMITZ WAS APPREHENDED ON SIMILAR CHARGES IN GERMANY. HE GOT HIMSELF CAUGHT IN GERMANY, AND HIS DNA IS IN THE DATABASE THERE. HE'S NOT OUR GUY. ECKHARD SCHMITZ IS NOT THE EAST AREA RAPIST. HE IS MERELY ONE OF MANY POTENTIAL SUSPECTS THAT HAVE SURFACED OVER THE YEARS. I HAVE BUILT SOME AMAZING CIRCUMSTANTIAL CASES AGAINST SUSPECTS ONLY TO HAVE DNA TELL ME IT'S THE WRONG GUY. AND I START TO REALIZE THAT THOSE THINGS THAT WE THINK FAR SURPASS THE POTENTIAL OF BEING COINCIDENCES ARE, IN FACT, COINCIDENCES. "THIS IS THE GUY," AND THEN WE'RE LEFT JUST DUMBFOUNDED THAT THE DNA SHOWS THAT IT'S NOT. THE ANSWER TO SOLVING THIS CASE COULD LIE IN STOCKTON. HOWEVER, THIS CITY WAS MERELY A PIT STOP FOR THE EAST AREA RAPIST AFTER HE LEAVES SACRAMENTO. AFTER THAT PART OF THE SERIES, HE SHOWS UP IN MODESTO EARLY JUNE OF 1978. MODESTO LIES 40 MILES SOUTH OF STOCKTON AND IS THE SITE OF ATTACK NUMBER 32. HE ATTACKS A COUPLE DOWN IN MODESTO, AND THEN TWO DAYS LATER, HE'S UP IN DAVIS ATTACKING A 19-YEAR-OLD FEMALE U.C. DAVIS STUDENT. DAVIS, WHERE ATTACK NUMBER 33 TAKES PLACE, IS 90 MILES NORTH OF MODESTO. A WEEK AND A HALF GOES BY, AND HE'S BACK DOWN IN MODESTO. ATTACKS ANOTHER COUPLE DOWN THERE, AND THEN WITHIN 22 HOURS, BASICALLY THE SAME DAY, HE'S UP HERE IN DAVIS ATTACKING A COUPLE IN THE VILLAGE HOMES DEVELOPMENT. ABOUT ANOTHER WEEK GOES BY, AND THEN HE ATTACKS A FEMALE, HIS THIRD ATTACK IN DAVIS. THE RAPID-FIRE PATTERN OF ATTACKS PING-PONGING BETWEEN THE TWO CITIES IS A COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED CHANGE OF COURSE FOR THE PERP. SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT HE PURPOSELY CHOSE TO MOVE OUT OF SACRAMENTO BECAUSE IT WAS JUST GETTING TOO HOT THERE. LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS GETTING TOO CLOSE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE AT ALL. I THINK HE HAD A LIFE CHANGE. EITHER HE WAS IN SCHOOL AND GRADUATED, OR HE WAS IN A JOB AND CHANGED JOBS, OR MAYBE HE WAS EVEN PROMOTED WITHIN A JOB, AND NOW THAT CHANGE CAUSED HIM TO BE SENT TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS, OTHER CITIES FOR HIS JOB, AND HE'S CHOOSING TO ATTACK WHILE HE'S AWAY FROM HIS HOME BASE. IF PAUL IS RIGHT, THE OFFENDER'S JOB TAKES HIM TO THE EAST BAY STARTING IN OCTOBER 1978. HE ZIG-ZAGS THROUGH THE AREA, SOMETIMES STRIKING EVERY OTHER WEEK, SOMETIMES GOING DORMANT FOR MONTHS. AND BY JULY 1979, HE HAS STRUCK 49 TIMES. THE MALE VICTIM IS A NOTORIOUSLY LIGHT SLEEPER, SO HE'S IN BED, AND HE HAS A SENSE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON IN HIS ROOM. HE WAKES UP, AND HE SEES AT THE FOOT OF HIS BED A GUY STANDING THERE, PULLING ON A SKI MASK. BY THIS TIME, MOST PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE EAST AREA RAPIST AND SOME EVEN HAVE A PLAN SHOULD THEY BECOME VICTIMS. HE GETS UP AND GOES FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE GUY AND IS YELLING AT HIM WHILE THE WIFE GETS UP AND RUNS OUT. IT'S A RISKY MOVE. THE EAST AREA RAPIST IS KNOWN TO CARRY A GUN AND USE IT WHEN NECESSARY. AS THE MALE VICTIM IS YELLING AT THE OFFENDER, THE OFFENDER IS JUST KIND OF SITTING THERE WITH THE SKI MASK ON BLINKING AT HIM, AND THEN THE MALE VICTIM ENDS UP RUNNING OUT. INCREDIBLY, THE COUPLE ESCAPES UNHARMED, AND THE INTRUDER DISAPPEARS INTO THE NIGHT. WHILE THERE IS NO DNA LEFT BEHIND, THE M.O. IS THAT OF THE EAST AREA RAPIST. POLICE ARE SURE IT WAS HIM. IT'S ALSO THE LAST TIME HE'S SEEN OR HEARD OF IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE PUBLIC HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT AT THE TIME. EVERY PERSON YOU WILL EVER TALK TO THAT GREW UP IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD OR IN THAT AREA AT THAT TIME HAS THEIR OWN PERSONAL IMPACT THAT THEY HAD BECAUSE IT WAS SO, SO FRIGHTENING. YOU JUST KNEW IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN. WHILE PEOPLE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE STILL LIVING IN THE WAKE OF THE NIGHTMARE CREATED BY THE EAST AREA RAPIST, FOLKS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SLEEP PEACEFULLY AT NIGHT WITH NO IDEA OF THE HORROR THAT IS HEADING THEIR WAY. A COUPLE IS ASLEEP IN THEIR BEDROOM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT -- AROUND 2:00 A.M., APPROXIMATELY, AND THEY'RE AWAKENED BY FLASHLIGHT BEAMS IN THEIR FACE. CHIEF DEPUTY BRUCE CORRELL OF THE SANTA BARBARA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WORKED THIS CASE FOR DECADES. HE'S STILL HAUNTED BY WHAT THE YOUNG COUPLE ENDURED THAT NIGHT. A VERY GRUFF VOICE SPEAKING THROUGH CLENCHED TEETH... USING OBSCENITIES, TELLING THEM NOT TO MOVE, NOT TO TURN THEIR HEADS, OR HE WOULD KILL THEM. HE TOLD THEM HE NEEDED MONEY. HE BROUGHT PRECUT SECTIONS OF ROPE WITH HIM. HE ASKED THE FEMALE TO TIE THE MALE. THEN HE TIED THE FEMALE. HE RUMMAGED AROUND THE HOUSE. HE MOVED A TELEVISION SET TO A DRESSER. HE SEEMINGLY COULDN'T FIND MUCH MONEY. IT'S CLASSIC EAST AREA RAPIST M.O., BUT AT THE TIME, SANTA BARBARA POLICE ARE UNAWARE. HE UNTIED THE ANKLES OF THE FEMALE AND GOT HER OUT OF BED. HE TOOK HER OUT TO THE KITCHEN, ASKING HER WHERE HER PURSE WAS. THEN HE LAID HER BACK DOWN ON THE LIVING-ROOM FLOOR, ON THE CARPET, AND RETIED HER ANKLES. HE WENT TO THE REFRIGERATOR, HE OPENED THE DOOR, AND SHE COULD HEAR HIM SAY "I'M GONNA KILL THEM. I'M GONNA KILL THEM," ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES. IN THE MEANTIME, SHE UNTIES HERSELF SOMEHOW, HER ANKLES, AND RAN OUT THE FRONT DOOR. THE KILLER CHASES HER DOWN. SHE'S SCREAMING. HE TELLS HER TO SHUT UP, GET BACK IN THE HOUSE. HE BRINGS HER BACK IN, RETIES HER. IN THE MEANTIME, THE MALE HAS UNTIED HIMSELF, GONE OUT THE BEDROOM DOOR, AND HE'S IN THE BACKYARD SCREAMING FOR HELP FROM THE NEIGHBORS. YET AGAIN, THE ATTACKER HAS LOST CONTROL OF HIS VICTIMS, BUT THIS TIME, POLICE ARE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. I WAS SO CLOSE TO THE AREA WHEN THE CALL WENT OUT, I WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE. AFTER OPERATING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR THREE YEARS, THE EAST AREA RAPIST MOVES SOUTH. HE STRIKES FIRST IN SANTA BARBARA, BUT THIS ATTEMPTED RAPE DOESN'T GO AS PLANNED. WHILE THE KILLER IS LOOKING IN THE BACKYARD FOR THE MAN, THE WOMAN BECOMES UNTIED AGAIN AND GOES OUT. A NEIGHBOR HEARS THE MAN YELLING FOR HELP AND CALLS POLICE. PATROL SERGEANT DICK SMITH REMEMBERS ARRIVING AT THE DRAMATIC SCENE LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. I WAS SO CLOSE TO THE AREA WHEN THE CALL WENT OUT, I WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE. AND AS I PULLED UP, THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS A NAKED WOMAN WITH HER HANDS TIED BEHIND HER BACK RUNNING TOWARD ME FOR HELP. SO, I PUT HER IN THE BACK SEAT OF MY CAR WHERE SHE WOULD BE SAFE. THIS WAS TAKING PLACE IN A RENTAL UNIT BEHIND A BIGGER HOUSE. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS A GENTLEMAN WHO OWNED THE PROPERTY HAPPENED TO BE AN FBI AGENT, SO HE AND I WENT IN TOGETHER TO CHECK THE RENTAL UNIT. NO ONE WAS THERE. THE SUSPECT HAD LEFT, AND THE RENTER ALSO HAD GOTTEN OUT. THEY ARE THE ONLY SURVIVING VICTIMS IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY THAT ACTUALLY WERE IN CONTACT WITH THIS KILLER AND PROBABLY COULD HAVE BEEN HOMICIDE VICTIMS THEMSELVES. AFTER ESCAPING THE HOUSE, THE SUSPECT STOLE A NEIGHBOR'S BICYCLE AND FLED. THE FBI AGENT GAVE CHASE IN HIS CAR. TODAY, SANTA BARBARA COLD CASE INVESTIGATOR JEFF KLAPAKIS RETRACES THE HEROIC PURSUIT. AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, THIS IS THE DRIVEWAY THAT LEADS TO THE HOME OF THE FIRST VICTIMS DIRECTLY BEHIND THIS OTHER HOME. THIS OTHER HOME WAS OWNED BY A NOW-RETIRED FBI AGENT WHO ACTUALLY ASSISTED THE VICTIMS IN THEIR ESCAPE AND THEIR ULTIMATE SAFETY. THE VICTIMS ARE STILL LIVING, BUT PREFER TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT, BOTH OF THEM. THEY'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT, YOU KNOW, SO MANY YEARS HAVE GONE BY, AND I'M JUST SURE THEY WANT TO MOVE ON. AS THE SUSPECT FLED ON THE BICYCLE, AND THE FBI AGENT FOLLOWING SUIT HERE. THEY WENT DOWN HERE TO A STREET CALLED KELLOGG AND TURNED LEFT. AS HE GETS UP HERE, FOR SOME REASON, HE REALIZES THAT HE'S GONNA HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM THAT FBI AGENT IN HIS VEHICLE, SO HE PULLS UP ON THIS ROAD HERE AND DUMPS THE BICYCLE IN THIS GENERAL VICINITY HERE. JUST DUMPS IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND LEAVES HIS KNIFE BEHIND, AS WELL. NOT ONLY DID THIS ATTACK GO AWRY, THE OFFENDER NEARLY GETS CAUGHT. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE CALCULATING PREDATOR WHO ONCE TERRORIZED NORTHERN CALIFORNIA? THREE MONTHS LATER, HE EMERGES AGAIN. THE NEXT EVENT OCCURRED THE 29th OF DECEMBER IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD. A COUPLE PULL UP TO THEIR HOME LATE IN THE EVENING, CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT, AND THEY SEE AN INDIVIDUAL RUN ACROSS THEIR LIVING ROOM. THEY CAN SEE HIM IN THE FRONT-ROOM WINDOW. WHEN THEY GO INTO THEIR HOME, THEIR DOG HAS BEEN SEVERELY BEATEN, AND THE PERSON IS GONE. WAS THIS COUPLE MEANT TO BE THE EAST AREA RAPIST'S NEXT VICTIMS? DID THEIR DOG CATCH HIM OFF GUARD? IF SO, IT'S THE LAST TIME THIS OFFENDER ALLOWS ANYONE TO GET AWAY FROM HIM. LATER THAT NIGHT, ANOTHER COUPLE, 35-YEAR-OLD DEBRA MANNING AND HER BOYFRIEND, 42-YEAR-OLD ROBERT OFFERMAN, DECIDE TO STAY THE NIGHT AT HIS PLACE, A CONDO IN THE SAME SANTA BARBARA NEIGHBORHOOD AS THE FIRST BOTCHED ATTACK. PROBABLY AROUND 2:30, 3:00 IN THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 30th, HE BROKE INTO THE OFFERMAN/ MANNING HOME AND BOUND THEM. HE USED THE FEMALE VICTIM TO TIE THE MALE VICTIM AND THEN TIED THE FEMALE VICTIM, LEFT HER FACEDOWN ON THE BED. THIS ATTACK STARTS EXACTLY LIKE ALL THE OTHERS, BUT ENDS VERY DIFFERENTLY, MARKING A TURNING POINT FOR THE EAST AREA RAPIST. AS OF THIS NIGHT, RAPE IS NO LONGER ENOUGH TO SATISFY HIM. THE MAGNITUDE OF HIS CRIME IS JUST AMAZING. HE HAS THE TWO BOUND FACEDOWN IN THEIR BED. AND WE KNOW, BASED ON ALL THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CASES, THAT ONCE HE GETS THE MALE AND FEMALE BOUND IN THE BED, HE GOES TO LOOK THROUGH THE HOUSE AND STARTS HIS BURGLARIZING. LOOKING FOR VALUABLES, LOOKING FOR THE DISHES TO PUT ON THE MALE'S BACK, SEEING IF THERE'S ANYBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE. HE WAS IN THE REFRIGERATOR AT THIS RESIDENCE, TOO, BECAUSE PART OF HIS CHRISTMAS TURKEY WAS CAST ASIDE OUT BEHIND THEIR RESIDENCE. THE OFFENDER RETURNS TO HIS VICTIMS, READY FOR PHASE TWO OF THE ATTACK. BUT THIS TIME, HIS NEXT MOVE IS CRITICALLY DIFFERENT. HE SHOOTS BOTH OF HIS VICTIMS DEAD. BRIAN AND KATIE MAGGIORE IN SACRAMENTO TWO YEARS PRIOR WERE MOST LIKELY THE EAST AREA RAPIST'S FIRST MURDER VICTIMS, BUT POLICE BELIEVE THEY WERE KILLED IN AN ACT OF SELF-PRESERVATION. CAN THE SAME BE SAID FOR DEBRA MANNING AND ROBERT OFFERMAN? COLD-CASE INVESTIGATOR JEFF KLAPAKIS RETURNS TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME TO TRY AND FIND OUT. THE OFFERMAN/MANNING HOME WAS HERE. WE HAD A VACANT HOME OVER HERE DURING THE TIME THAT THE OWNER HAD NOT MOVED INTO YET, AND WE HAD ANOTHER FAMILY LIVING HERE. THE HOME THAT WAS VACANT WAS THIS ONE NEXT DOOR, AND HE MADE FORCIBLE ENTRY THROUGH THERE. AND AGAIN, BINDINGS AND SHOE IMPRESSIONS MATCHING THE ONES HERE WERE FOUND INSIDE THE HOUSE. THE KILLER MUST HAVE KNOWN THE CONDO NEXT DOOR WAS VACANT AND WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE EMPTY SPACE TO STALK HIS NEXT VICTIMS. THE HOME BEHIND YOU IS A HOME WHERE A BICYCLE WAS STOLEN. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SUSPECT USED THAT AS A MODE OF ESCAPE, SOMEHOW OR OTHER GOT ACROSS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CREEK BED WHERE WE FOUND OTHER BINDINGS LAYING ON THE GROUND OVER THERE. AND THAT BIKE WAS EVENTUALLY DUMPED UP NORTH OF THE ORIGINAL CRIME SCENE. ONCE AGAIN, THE KILLER USES A STOLEN BIKE FOR HIS ESCAPE. WAS THAT PART OF HIS PLAN? YOU CAN SEE HOW INTELLIGENT HE IS. HE STRATEGICALLY THINKS ABOUT WHAT HE WANTS TO DO AND HOW HE'S GONNA DO IT. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THIS ATTACK HAD BEEN PERFECTLY PLANNED. DOES THAT MEAN THAT MURDER WAS THE INTENDED OUTCOME? A CLOSER LOOK AT THE CRIME SCENE COULD PROVIDE THE ANSWER. IT APPEARS THAT WHEN HE COMES BACK INTO THE ROOM, DR. OFFERMAN HAS SLIPPED HIS BINDINGS AND GETS UP AND TRIES TO RUN AROUND THE BED AT HIM. NOW HE ENDS UP SHOOTING. CATCHES HIM IN THE NECK, PROBABLY THE FIRST SHOT, AND THEN CONTINUES TO SHOOT AS OFFERMAN PROCEEDS TO COME AT HIM UNTIL OFFERMAN GOES DOWN. IN FACT, THERE'S A SINGLE SHOT THAT IS FIRED WITH DR. OFFERMAN FACEDOWN ON THE GROUND. IT APPEARS THAT DR. OFFERMAN WAS PROBABLY STILL TRYING TO COME AFTER HIM, AND HE'S GOING, "NOPE." THEN HE GOES OVER AND DOES A SINGLE GUNSHOT TO THE BACK OF DR. MANNING'S HEAD AND RUNS OFF. IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THIS WAS A PREMEDITATED MURDER, BUT PERHAPS THE VICTIM'S ATTEMPTED ESCAPE WAS THE INCENTIVE THE PERP NEEDED TO DO WHAT HE REALLY WANTED -- KILL. I WAS HAVING A PROBLEM WITH HOW COULD A GUY THAT COMMITTED -- I WOULDN'T SAY PERFECT CRIMES UP IN NORTH CALIFORNIA, BUT I DON'T REMEMBER TOO MANY OF HIS VICTIMS ESCAPING UP THERE. YET HE COMES DOWN HERE, AND ALL HIS VICTIMS ESCAPE IN SOME FASHION. SO, EITHER HE JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN FORGOT HOW TO DO WHAT HE DOES, OR HAS HE PROGRESSED IN HIS CRIME SPREE TO WANTING TO GO BEYOND SEXUAL ASSAULTS TO HOMICIDE? PERHAPS HE WAS READY TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP TO MURDER, BUT HE WASN'T ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT SOME PROVOCATION. WE SAW IN THAT FIRST SANTA BARBARA CASE, HE'S VERBALLY SAYING, "I'M GONNA KILL THEM." SO, WE KNOW THAT HE'S AT THAT POINT IN HIS EVOLUTION. THE ESCALATION OF CRIMES IS TEXTBOOK BEHAVIOR FOR A SERIAL PREDATOR. DOES IT CORRESPOND WITH HIS MOVE DOWN SOUTH? AT THIS POINT, IT'S STILL IMPOSSIBLE TO CONFIRM. BUT THE CHANGE OF LOCATION DOES HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT FILTER THE THEORY THAT THE OFFENDER HAD SOME CONNECTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRY. ONE HUGE DEVELOPMENT FIRM THAT WAS BASED OUT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS VERY ACTIVE IN THE EAST BAY, AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THE OFFENDER, IN A NUMBER OF HIS ATTACKS IN THE EAST BAY, WAS ATTACKING IN THIS DEVELOPER'S HOUSES. COULD A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY BE THE REASON THE EAST AREA RAPIST MOVED SOUTH? SOMETHING HAD TO HAVE BROUGHT HIM FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DOWN TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO THIS SORT OF RANDOM AREA, AND THIS COULD BE IT. COLD-CASE INVESTIGATOR PAUL HOLES HAS BEEN CHASING DOWN A THEORY THAT THE EAST AREA RAPIST WAS WORKING IN THE DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRY IN THE 1970s. NOW A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY WITH LOCATIONS IN TWO OF HIS ATTACK VENUES HAS COME TO LIGHT. AND SO, I THOUGHT, "OOH, HERE'S A COMMONALITY," AND STARTED TO ASK THAT DEVELOPER, "DO YOU HAVE RECORDS?" THEY DON'T, YOU KNOW, BUT YOU START TALKING TO PEOPLE. "DO YOU HAVE ANY OLD-TIMERS THAT ARE STILL WORKING OR YOU'RE IN STILL IN CONTACT WITH WHO ARE STILL AROUND THAT I CAN PICK THEIR BRAINS TO SEE, 'OH, I REMEMBER THIS GUY.' YOU KNOW? THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING. BUT THIS COMPANY ISN'T THE ONLY ONE OF INTEREST. AT THE TIME THAT HE FIRST STARTS TO ATTACK DOWN IN SANTA BARBARA, THERE WAS A MAJOR STRIP MALL THAT WAS BEING BUILT OUT, AND IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT ONE OF THE DEVELOPERS OF THAT STRIP MALL WAS OUT OF SACRAMENTO. AND I KNOW SANTA BARBARA SHERIFF'S OFFICE HAS BEEN EXPLORING THAT ANGLE VERY DILIGENTLY FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS. IN THE LATE '70s AND EARLY '80s, DEVELOPMENT WAS BOOMING ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. CITIZEN SLEUTHS MIKE MORFORD AND KEITH KOMOS ARE ALSO LOOKING INTO A COMPANY WITH TIES TO THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH FOR WHOM THE OFFENDER MIGHT HAVE WORKED. WE'VE GOTTEN A TIP THAT THERE'S A COMPANY, A DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, THAT'S BASED IN THIS AREA HERE THAT ALSO IS DOING WORK DOWN IN THIS AREA OF SANTA BARBARA AT THE TIME OF THE MURDERS. SO THIS COMPANY SORT OF MIRRORS HIS MOVEMENTS ALSO? ABSOLUTELY. DUE TO THE SENSITIVE NATURE OF AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION, THE COMPANY CAN'T BE NAMED. WE'RE GONNA CALL THAT "COMPANY 'X'." YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. WE HAVE TO KEEP EVERYTHING PRIVATE. MIKE AND KEITH MAP OUT THE ATTACK SITES IN SANTA BARBARA TO GET A BETTER IDEA OF THE GEOGRAPHY. WE'VE GOT THE FIRST MURDER, AND WE'VE GOT THE ATTEMPTED MURDER. DOCTORS OFFERMAN AND MANNING WERE MURDERED RIGHT HERE. THE TWINE WAS FOUND RIGHT ABOUT HERE. WE KNOW BASED ON TRACKS THAT HE ACTUALLY WENT INTO THIS SAN JOSE CREEK BED AREA. HE HAD STOLEN A BIKE RIGHT ABOUT HERE. RIGHT. RIGHT. RIGHT. HID IT RIGHT ABOUT THERE. WE'VE GOT A MURDER HERE, AND THEN WE'VE GOT ANOTHER MURDER OVER HERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SMALL AREA. AND THEN FOR A SACRAMENTO COMPANY TO SHOW UP RIGHT HERE IN THE THICK OF THINGS, THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT DESERVES TO BE LOOKED AT. NOW WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO IS DO A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND SEARCHING TO SEE WHERE WE CAN CONNECT COMPANY X TO IF THEY FALL IN LINE HERE. YEAH, LET'S DO THAT. MIKE GETS TO WORK EXAMINING DEEDS, PROPERTY RECORDS, AND BUILDING PERMITS TO SEE IF HE CAN CONNECT COMPANY X TO THE ATTACK SITES OR THE VICTIMS. YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE SORT OF THING THAT REALLY DESERVES BEING LOOKED AT AND DESERVES HAVING RESOURCES BEING SPENT ON IT, AND AS AMATEUR INVESTIGATORS, THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP. YOU KNOW, LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS LEADS THAT THEY GO THROUGH, AND THESE ARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO ASSIST THEM. KEITH, YOU GOT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. HERE, COME ON. SO, I SEARCHED FOR SOME PERMIT AND PROPERTY RECORDS. YEAH. COME TO FIND OUT COMPANY "X" IS ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL PROPERTIES IN HERE. THERE'S A COUPLE VERY INTERESTING ONES. FIRST OFF, AFTER THE MANNING AND OFFERMAN MURDERS, HE WALKED TO THIS AREA HERE. HE DROPPED A PIECE OF TWINE IN A YARD. THE YARD HE DROPPED THE TWINE IN WAS A FAMILY MEMBER OF COMPANY X. REALLY? YEP. ONE OF THE COMPANY'S FAMILY MEMBERS LIVED AT THAT ADDRESS. WOW, OKAY. IT GETS EVEN BETTER. SO, AFTER THERE, HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THIS WAY. WE KNOW HE CAME OUT IN THIS AREA HERE BECAUSE THEY FOUND EVIDENCE OF HIS FOOTPRINTS. IN AUGUST 1979, THIS COMPANY PURCHASED A PROPERTY RIGHT HERE. SO, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS BOTH OF THESE PINS ON THE MAP, BOTH OF THESE LOCATIONS, THE TWINE AND FOOTPRINTS WERE FOUND AFTER THE MURDER WERE ASSOCIATED WITH COMPANY "X". THAT'S CORRECT. TO THE SLEUTHS, IT'S NOT JUST THE LOCATION OF THE HOMES OWNED BY COMPANY "X" IN RELATION TO THE EVIDENCE THAT'S OF INTEREST. THE FIRST INCIDENT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SANTA BARBARA OCCURRED IN LATE SEPTEMBER, YOU KNOW, EARLY OCTOBER 1979, AND THIS HOUSE WAS BOUGHT BASICALLY SIX MONTHS, A MONTH OR TWO PREVIOUS? AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE LOOK AT THE LAST ACTIVITY UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, THAT WAS JULY OF 1979. THEY BOUGHT THIS PROPERTY AUGUST OF 1979. BY OCTOBER 1979, HE'S IN THIS AREA. THE TIMING FITS WAY TIGHTER AND WAY BETTER THAN WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT, AND THE GEOGRAPHY FITS WAY, WAY BETTER. WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS, LEADS RIGHT TO SOMEBODY'S DOORSTEP THAT CHECKS SO MANY OTHER BOXES, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SEND DIRECTLY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY CAN TAKE IT ANOTHER STEP, THEY CAN TAKE IT FURTHER THAN I'M ABLE TO TAKE IT, AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE GO A STEP FURTHER TO RULE THEM OUT, OR MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT MORE PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT COMPANY. BECAUSE OF GREAT TIPS THAT WE'VE SENT IN IN THE PAST, WE'VE GOT A DIRECT LINE TO THEM, AND THEY BEGIN WORKING ON THINGS IMMEDIATELY. THE KEY TO IDENTIFYING THE KILLER MAY LIE IN THESE COMPANIES IN SANTA BARBARA, BUT THE OFFENDER'S TRAIL DOES NOT STOP THERE. HE CONTINUES SOUTH TO VENTURA COUNTY WHERE HE COMMITS AN ATTACK UNLIKE ANY OTHER. IT'S NOT UNTIL MARCH OF 1980 WITH LYMAN AND CHARLENE SMITH IN WHICH HE'S ABLE TO COMPLETE WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. EVERY TIME I GO DOWN THE HILL TO LEAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD, SOMEWHERE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, IT'S DRAWN TO THE HORROR OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE. IT'S STILL THERE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. THREE MONTHS AFTER HIS LAST ATTACK, THE EAST AREA RAPIST STRIKES AGAIN. AND THIS TIME, HE SHOWS A PENCHANT FOR A NEW AND PERVERSE FORM OF TORTURE. IN MARCH OF 1980, 35-YEAR-OLD CHARLENE SMITH AND 43-YEAR-OLD LYMAN SMITH HAD JUST MOVED INTO THEIR DREAM HOUSE IN A NEW VENTURA DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS -- CHARLENE AND LYMAN ACTUALLY PUT ON OUR WEDDING. THEY STOOD UP WITH US IN MANNING PARK. VERY CASUAL. LET'S SEE. ANOTHER GOOD PICTURE OF -- HERE'S ANOTHER PICTURE WITH CHARLENE AND LYMAN AND THEN MY TWO DAUGHTERS, AND I KNOW SHE WOULD HAVE MADE A WONDERFUL MOTHER IF HER LIFE HAD NOT BEEN CUT SO SHORT, WHICH IS REALLY SAD. THEIR GOOD FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR, CLAIRE LEWIS-JENKS, HAD RECENTLY MOVED IN, AS WELL. I WAS GOING DOWN THE HILL, AND I SAW THEIR CARS -- CHARLENE AND LYMAN'S CARS WERE IN THEIR DRIVEWAY. I DECIDED I'D STOP BY, AND I RANG THE DOORBELL, AND NOBODY ANSWERED, SO I LEFT. AND THAT WAS ON FRIDAY, AND THEN IT WAS JUST TWO DAYS LATER, SUNDAY, WHEN I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HILL WITH MY HUSBAND, AS WE WERE GOING DOWN THE HILL, WE SAW ALL THESE POLICE CARS AT LYMAN AND CHARLENE'S HOUSE. AND SO, WE PULLED OVER, AND MY HUSBAND WAS THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT AT THAT TIME. AND WE PULLED OVER, AND I ASKED HIM TO GO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED, AND HE CAME BACK AND TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE DEAD. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. IT'S JUST HARD TO TAKE IT ALL IN. LYMAN'S SON, GARY, WAS THERE. HE'S THE ONE WHO FOUND THEM, AND SO WE ENDED UP TAKING GARY UP TO OUR HOUSE UP HERE. AND I STILL REMEMBER THINKING, "MY GOD. HOW AM I GOING TO ENTERTAIN THE 12-YEAR-OLD WHO JUST FOUND HIS DAD AND HIS STEPMOTHER BLUDGEONED TO DEATH?" CHARLENE AND LYMAN WERE TIED UP. SHE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED, AND THEN BOTH WERE BEATEN TO DEATH WITH A LOG FROM A WOOD PILE IN THEIR BACKYARD. IT'S A TERRIFYING CRIME SCENE AND A TRAGEDY THAT STILL HAUNTS LEWIS-JENKS. SHE HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL. WHO KNOWS WHAT SHE COULD HAVE OR WOULD HAVE DONE? AND LYMAN, TOO. I MEAN, HE WAS UP FOR JUDGESHIP, AND THEIR WHOLE LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A LIFE TO LIVE. SO, IT IS SAD, AND IT MAKES YOU VERY ANGRY. CHARLENE AND LYMAN HAD A BRIGHT FUTURE STOLEN FROM THEM, AND THAT GIVES PAUL HOLES A POTENTIAL CLUE. THE MALE VICTIM, LYMAN SMITH, HE'S NOT YOUR AVERAGE VICTIM. THIS WAS A FORMER D.A. HE WAS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS KILLED. BUT THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN WAS CONSIDERING APPOINTING HIM TO BECOME A JUDGE. LYMAN SMITH WAS A WELL-KNOWN MOVER AND SHAKER IN VENTURA. HE WAS ALSO A PARTNER IN A DEVELOPMENT FIRM. WAS LYMAN THE TARGET OF THE ATTACK? SO I REALLY LOOKED AT THE VENTURA CASE AS POSSIBLY BEING ONE CASE IN WHICH OUR OFFENDER MAY HAVE HAD A PRIOR INTERACTION WITH MAYBE THE MALE VICTIM, LYMAN SMITH, AND THAT'S THE REASON HE WENT TO KILL THEM BECAUSE HE GOT UPSET WITH HIM OVER MAYBE A BUSINESS TRANSACTION. IT'S JUST A THEORY. HE COULD VERY WELL HAVE JUST SEEN BEAUTIFUL CHARLENE DOWNTOWN VENTURA AND FOLLOWED HER BACK. BUT SINCE I'M GOING DOWN THE DEVELOPMENT INVESTIGATIVE ANGLE, THE VENTURA CASE STANDS OUT IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE OF WHO LYMAN SMITH WAS AND WHAT HE WAS INVOLVED WITH. IT ALSO MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THE KILLER CHOSE TO BLUDGEON THE SMITHS TO DEATH RATHER THAN SHOOT THEM LIKE HE DID IN THE LAST TWO MURDERS. WHEN YOU ASK WHY BLUDGEONING, THERE IS A PRACTICAL SIDE TO THE BLUDGEONING BECAUSE IT'S QUIET VERSUS THE GUN. I THINK THE PERSONAL ASPECT, PROBABLY THE SENSATION OF THE DAMAGE THAT HE'S INFLICTING ON THE VICTIMS. THE FACT THAT HE'S INFLICTING THE VIOLENCE TO THE VICTIMS' HEADS AND FACES HAS PERSONAL ASPECT. HE COULD HAVE CHOSEN TO STAB THEM, BUT HE DOESN'T. HE CHOOSES TO BLUDGEON. PERSONAL OR NOT, THIS, HIS 53rd ATTACK AND HIS THIRD MURDER, MARKS A FATEFUL TURNING POINT IN THE EAST AREA RAPIST'S CAREER. AND THE BLOODSHED THAT FOLLOWS KEEPS GETTING WORSE. WITH LYMAN AND CHARLENE SMITH, HE'S ABLE TO COMPLETE WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, AND THAT IS GO IN, ATTACK THEM, BIND THEM UP, SEXUALLY ASSAULT THE FEMALE, AND THEN KILL THEM. SO, THAT REALLY IS HIS FIRST CASE THAT HE SUCCEEDS TO FULFILL HIS FINAL FANTASY, SO TO SPEAK -- TAKE HIM ALL THE WAY TO THE HOMICIDES. DOWN SOUTH, THEY CALLED HIM THE ORIGINAL NIGHT STALKER, BUT NOW EVERYONE KNOWS HIM AS THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER, AND THE HORROR HE SPREADS LIVES ON UNTIL HE IS BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. NEXT TIME ON "THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER: IT'S NOT OVER"... SO, THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A BUILDING RAGE. DID THIS RAGE CONTINUE ON? IT APPEARS THAT HE'S USING POSSIBLY TWO WEAPONS. HER TEETH WERE KNOCKED OUT, AND THEY WERE IN HER LUNGS. AND THAT'S THE LAST CASE THAT WE KNOW. DO I THINK IT'S GONNA BE SOLVED BY A TIP? YEAH, A TIP OR PERSISTENCE THROUGH TRADITIONAL LAW-ENFORCEMENT MEANS. IF PEOPLE KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR, THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO DIG BACK INTO THEIR MEMORIES AND COME UP WITH SOMEBODY. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S GONNA BE PUTTING A NAME THAT'S GIVEN OR IDENTIFIED TO THE DNA PROFILE.
