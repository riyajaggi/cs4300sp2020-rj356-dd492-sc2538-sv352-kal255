 PREVIOUSLY ON IT'S NOT OVER"... HE IS A NIGHTMARE COME TO LIFE, A MONSTER HIDING BEHIND A SKI MASK. I CHALLENGE ANYBODY TO FIND A CASE WHERE YOU'VE GOT UPWARDS OF 50 RAPES AND 12 MURDERS SPANNING THIS AMOUNT OF TIME THAT HAS NOT BEEN SOLVED. HE IS A DIABOLICAL PREDATOR, AND FOR THE MOST PART, HE REMAINS UNKNOWN. WE WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW JUST AS MUCH

 ABOUT THE EAST AREA RAPIST/GOLDEN STATE KILLER. JUST LIKE PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE ZODIAC KILLER OR TED BUNDY OR BTK. FROM 1976 TO 1986, HE TERRORIZED SUBURBAN CALIFORNIA AND THEN DISAPPEARED. HE BLENDED IN SO WELL THAT HE COULDN'T BE TRACKED. HE COULDN'T BE FOUND. BUT THE ONE THING HE FAILED TO DO, AND HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT, WAS HE DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR DNA TECHNOLOGY. TO HUNT HIM DOWN, INVESTIGATORS MUST LEARN EVERYTHING POSSIBLE ABOUT HIM. NOW, WHY WAS A HELICOPTER FOCUSING IN ON THAT HOUSE?

 ALLEGEDLY, THEY HAD THE INDIVIDUAL CORNERED. IT'S A RACE AGAINST TIME TO CATCH A DEADLY SERIAL PREDATOR. I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER READING ABOUT THE CASES AND THE ATTACKS. I WAS READING EVERY SINGLE ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT IN "THE SACRAMENTO BEE." I WAS FASCINATED WITH THE CASES AND THE PROFILERS THAT WERE TRYING TO GET A GRIP ON WHAT THIS GUY WAS ABOUT. I'M SURE MY MOM AND I PROBABLY DISCUSSED THE ATTACKS, BUT HER TAKE ON IT WAS THAT SHE WAS TOO OLD, AND I WAS TOO YOUNG TO BE POSSIBLE VICTIMS OF THIS SERIAL RAPIST. THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 11th, AT 2:30 A.M., MARGARET AND HER MOTHER ARE TRAGICALLY PROVEN WRONG. MARGARET IS JUST 2 WEEKS SHY OF HER 13th BIRTHDAY. I'M AWOKEN FROM A DEEP SLEEP, AND THERE'S A FLASHLIGHT IN MY FACE, AND A MAN WITH GLOVES TELLING ME, "PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK." INITIALLY, I REFUSED. MULTIPLE TIMES, I SAY, "QUIT JOKING AROUND." AND HE JUST SAYS, "THIS IS NOT A JOKE." PUT MY HANDS BEHIND MY BACK. AND HE TIES MY HANDS UP, AND I'M ON MY STOMACH, AND I REALIZE AT THAT POINT, IT IS NOT A JOKE. IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO FIGURE OUT THAT THIS WAS MOST LIKELY THE SERIAL RAPIST. BECAUSE MARGARET HAS READ SO MUCH ABOUT THIS PREDATOR, SHE KNOWS WHAT TO EXPECT. WHEN HE TIES HER UP, SHE DOESN'T PANIC. I WAS VERY MUCH AWARE OF WHAT HIS M.O. WAS. HE HAD A VERY DISTINCTIVE M.O. HE USED TO USE PLATES AS A WARNING SIGNAL, SO THE PERSON THAT WAS NOT BEING ATTACKED WOULD END UP WITH PLATES ON HIS BACK. AND HE WOULD TELL THEM, "IF I HEAR THESE PLATES RATTLE, I WILL KILL YOUR WIFE, AND I WILL COME BACK HERE AND KILL YOU." AND SO, HE USED THOSE PLATES AS A WARNING SYSTEM. I COULD HEAR HIM UPSTAIRS. HE'S UPSTAIRS GETTING SOME PLATES TOGETHER, AND HE STARTS COMING DOWN THOSE STAIRS WITH THOSE PLATES. AND I HEAR HIM COMING, AND I THINK TO MYSELF, "WELL, YOU KNOW, IF HE COMES INTO MY ROOM WITH THOSE PLATES, HE'S GONNA RAPE MY MOM. AND IF HE GOES INTO MY MOM'S ROOM WITH THOSE PLATES, HE'S GONNA RAPE ME." I HEAR HIM GO INTO MY MOM'S ROOM WITH THOSE PLATES, AND I KNOW HE'S GONNA BE COMING INTO MY ROOM SHORTLY TO RAPE ME. I KNEW WHAT HE WANTED. WHERE HE GOT HIS SATISFACTION WAS FEAR, SCARING PEOPLE, AND MAKING THEM GO ALONG WITH WHAT HE WANTED THEM TO DO. AND SO I REMEMBERED MAYBE BEING MORE INDIGNANT. BUT I WAS 12 YEARS OLD, AND YOU'RE KIND OF IMMORTAL AT THAT POINT. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T THINK SOMETHING BAD'S GONNA HAPPEN. I DEFINITELY TRIED TO REMEMBER OR TAKE NOTE OF EVERYTHING I COULD. HE HAD ON A PLAID SHIRT, LIKE A PENDLETON SHIRT, AND I BELIEVE MAYBE BLUE JEANS. HE WAS SLENDER. AND THEN WITH HIM DISGUISING HIS VOICE, HE WAS ALWAYS ASKING, LIKE, "DO YOU WANT ME TO KILL YOU? DO YOU WANT ME TO KILL YOU? DO YOU WANT TO DIE?" HE WAS VERY, VERY, VERY ANGRY. MARGARET IS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. HER MOTHER IS NOT. THE RAPIST STAYS IN THE HOUSE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF... ...TERRORIZING MARGARET AND TRAUMATIZING HER MOTHER, WHO HAD BEEN RENDERED HELPLESS TO SAVE HER DAUGHTER. AND MOM HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME. OF COURSE, YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR CHILD, AND SHE HAD A VERY, VERY HARD TIME WITH THE ATTACK. SOME PEOPLE SPECULATE HE'S DEAD. I REALLY -- I THINK HE'S OUT THERE. I THINK HE COULD BE OUT THERE. I REALLY DO. AND I HOPE THAT ALL THIS PUBLICITY CAN BRING THIS PERSON IN. SOMEBODY KNOWS SOMETHING. THERE IS A GIRLFRIEND OF HIS OUT THERE THAT KNOWS THE WAY HE'S ACTED AROUND HER. HE'S MISTREATED PEOPLE IN HIS LIFE. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIS BEHAVIORS, I'M SURE. PEOPLE HE'S HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH. MAYBE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT KNOW ABOUT WHAT HE'S DONE. SOMEONE KNOWS SOMETHING. IT'S A BELIEF THAT RESONATES FROM THOSE WHO CAME FACE-TO-FACE WITH THIS MONSTER TO THOSE WHO ARE HUNTING HIM TODAY. I DON'T KNOW IF THE GUY'S ALIVE OR DEAD, BUT LET'S SAY HE HAD JOURNALS, AND SOMEBODY'S CLEARING OUT AN ATTIC. MAYBE THERE'S SKI MASKS. MAYBE THERE'S TRICKS OF HIS TRADE. MAYBE THERE'S NEWSPAPER ARTICLES FROM BACK IN THE DAY. SOMEBODY KEPT TROPHIES, WHATEVER IT IS. IF YOU CAN GET THE INFORMATION OUT THERE, THEN THAT PROVIDES THE PUBLIC WITH THE POTENTIAL ABILITY TO HELP US WITH THAT. ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE, WHICH IS THE NAME. FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY ANNE MARIE SCHUBERT, THIS CASE IS PERSONAL. IN 1976, WHEN THE EAST AREA RAPIST WAS JUST BEGINNING HIS REIGN OF TERROR, SHE WAS A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL GROWING UP IN SACRAMENTO. IT REALLY DID CHANGE SACRAMENTO. IT WASN'T ONE RAPE. IT WASN'T TWO RAPES. IT WAS UPWARDS OF 35 RAPES IN A PERIOD OF 21/2 TO 3 YEARS JUST IN THIS AREA. AND SO EVERYBODY WALKED ON EGGSHELLS. EVERYBODY WAS FEARFUL. YOU KNOW, WHEN IS -- IT'S NOT A MATTER OF IF HE'S COMING AGAIN, IT WAS WHEN. AND YOU ANTICIPATED THAT IT WAS COMING VERY, VERY SOON BECAUSE IT WAS ON THE NEWS EVERY DAY. THE EAST AREA RAPIST WAS OFTEN ATTACKING AT A RATE OF TWICE OR MORE A MONTH, ALWAYS IN SACRAMENTO, ALWAYS IN CLUSTERS. HE SEEMS TOO FAMILIAR WITH THESE NEIGHBORHOODS FOR THERE NOT TO BE A CONNECTION. THIS IS CALLED FAIR OAKS BOULEVARD. THIS IS A VERY, VERY BIG STREET IN SACRAMENTO. IT'S A THOROUGHFARE. IT'S ONE OF THE MAIN ARTERIES THAT LEAD TO SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE SOME OF THESE ASSAULTS OCCURRED. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATTERN OF THE ASSAULTS, THIS PARTICULAR AREA THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW WITHIN -- I WOULD SAY THEY'RE WITHIN TWO BLOCKS, TWO TO THREE BLOCKS OF EACH OTHER THAT THESE ASSAULTS ARE OCCURRING. AND THAT TELLS YOU HOW CLOSE IN PROXIMITY THINGS WERE. AND THE SIMILAR STORY WOULD BE IF YOU WENT OUT TO THE ASSAULTS IN RANCHO CORDOVA, I MEAN, THEY ARE LITERALLY -- SOME OF THEM ALMOST KITTY-CORNER FROM EACH OTHER. SO, YOU START TO ASK YOURSELF, "DID HE LIVE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AT THAT PERIOD OF TIME?" USING ATTACK PATTERNS TO HONE IN ON WHERE AN OFFENDER MOST LIKELY RESIDES IS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE CALLED GEOGRAPHIC PROFILING. AND THESE PATTERNS SEEM TO ALL POINT IN ONE DIRECTION. I MAY BE COMPLETELY 100% OFF THE MARK ON THIS, BUT I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWER TO THIS CASE LIES IN SACRAMENTO. IN THE LATE 1970s, THE PREDATOR KNOWN THEN AS THE EAST AREA RAPIST EXHIBITED A CLEAR PATTERN OF ATTACKS. AFTER TODAY'S INVESTIGATORS ANALYZE THOSE PATTERNS, A CHILLING POSSIBILITY EMERGES. THE MONSTER WHO TERRORIZED SACRAMENTO 40 YEARS AGO COULD ALSO HAVE LIVED THERE. ON THE MONITOR ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE, WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS LITERALLY AN OVERVIEW IN GOOGLE EARTH OF THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE YELLOW PUSH PINS ARE DEMARKING EVERY SINGLE ATTACK LOCATION THAT WE KNOW THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER COMMITTED. AND AS I ZOOM IN, I AM NOW LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF THE ATTACKS THAT THE EAST AREA RAPIST COMMITTED IN SACRAMENTO. FROM JUNE OF '76 UP UNTIL SEPTEMBER OF '77, HE HAD COMMITTED 22 ATTACKS IN SACRAMENTO. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION, HE'S CRISSCROSSING ALL OVER SACRAMENTO, SHOWING THE BROAD FAMILIARITY. BUT ON SEPTEMBER 6, 1977, THERE'S AN ANOMALY IN THE PATTERN. HE ATTACKS 50 MILES SOUTH OF SACRAMENTO, FAR AWAY FROM HIS COMFORT ZONE. IT'S JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT, AND A COUPLE ARE FAST ASLEEP IN THEIR OWN HOME WHEN A MASKED MAN QUIETLY ENTERS THROUGH A SLIDING-GLASS DOOR. HE WAKES THEM UP, BLINDS THEM WITH A FLASHLIGHT, AND DEMANDS MONEY AND FOOD BEFORE TYING THEM BOTH UP AND RAPING THE WOMAN. IT'S A CLASSIC EAST AREA RAPIST ATTACK. AND IT HAS COLD-CASE INVESTIGATOR PAUL HOLES INTRIGUED. WHY WOULD A MAN WHO HAD STALKED SACRAMENTO FOR SO LONG SUDDENLY STRIKE FAR OUTSIDE THE CITY HE KNOWS SO WELL? I HAD NEVER BEEN TO STOCKTON BEFORE I STARTED WORKING THIS CASE AND REALLY LOOKING INTO THE STOCKTON ATTACKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERIES. AND I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I STARTED DRIVING AROUND SOME OF THESE LOCATIONS. IN TERMS OF HOW NICE SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENTS ARE, PARTICULARLY THIS DEVELOPMENT THAT WE'RE IN WHERE THE FIRST STOCKTON ATTACK OCCURRED. IT'S A MASTER PLAN COMMUNITY THAT WAS STARTED IN THE LATE '60s AND WAS STILL ACTIVELY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT THE TIME OF THAT FIRST STOCKTON ATTACK. AT THE TIME THAT THIS ATTACK OCCURRED, HIGHWAY 5 WAS NOT OPEN. WE KNOW OUR OFFENDER IS COMING OUT OF SACRAMENTO. HE HAD TO COME DOWN HIGHWAY 99, WHICH IS A GOOD 6 MILES AWAY. SO OUR OFFENDER HAS PULLED OUT TO THIS WESTERN PART OF STOCKTON TO COMMIT THIS ATTACK. THE QUESTION IS, WELL, WHAT WOULD PULL HIM OUT HERE? IT'S A QUESTION PAUL HAS SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME TRYING TO ANSWER. HI, PAUL. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. ALL RIGHT. HOW'S IT BEEN GOING? - IT'S BEEN GOOD. - YEAH? TODAY, PAUL PAYS A VISIT TO A RESIDENT WHO LIVES NEXT TO THE SCENE OF THAT FIRST STOCKTON ATTACK, HOPING TO SEE IF ANYTHING NEW STANDS OUT. THE RESIDENT HAS ASKED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS AND PREFERS TO KEEP HIS FACE OBSCURED. SO, YOU'VE BEEN RESIDING AT THIS LOCATION FOR HOW LONG NOW? BEEN OVER 40 YEARS, PAUL. WE GOT OUR GEESE THAT WE FEED EVERY MORNING. PART OF YOUR REHAB THERE, HUH? YEAH. YEAH, IT IS KIND OF THERAPY. AND THE THINGS HAVE REALLY DEVELOPED. THERE USED TO BE A HOUSE THAT WAS IN CONSTRUCTION OVER HERE TO OUR LEFT. THIS WAS OPEN, ALSO. THERE WASN'T A FENCE, SO YOU CAN TRAVERSE FROM PENINSULA COURT INTO THE PARK QUITE EASILY. 40 YEARS AGO, WE HAD AN ATTACK THAT OCCURRED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THIS LAKE. YOU WERE HERE AT THAT TIME, RIGHT? WE LIVED HERE, YEAH. AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME, WE WERE AT A FUNDRAISER. OUR KIDS WERE HERE WITH A BABYSITTER. - OKAY. - WHEN THE ATTACK OCCURRED. WE WERE CONTACTED TO COME HOME IMMEDIATELY, WHICH WE DID, AND THE POLICE WERE CIRCLING THE HOUSE THAT WAS IN DEVELOPMENT. WHICH IS RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NEXT DOOR? - RIGHT THERE, YEAH, YEAH. - SO YOU HAVE PATROL CARS HERE. THE LIGHTS ARE GOING. - YEAH. SPOTLIGHTS FROM THE HELICOPTERS GOING. HELICOPTER KEPT MOVING AROUND THE AREA, JUST MOVING AROUND, MOVING AROUND. NOW, WHY WAS THE HELICOPTER FOCUSING IN ON THAT HOUSE? ALLEGEDLY, THEY HAD THE INDIVIDUAL CORNERED WITHIN THE HOUSE. BUT IT WAS -- IT WAS ALL FRAMED OUT. IT WAS BASICALLY OPEN. ALL RIGHT. AND -- AND THEY'RE THINKING THAT THIS WAS THE EAST AREA RAPIST THAT THEY HAD CORNERED INSIDE THIS HOUSE. YES, YEAH, YEAH. ONCE AGAIN, THE EAST AREA RAPIST IS ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM WHAT SEEMS LIKE AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION. DID YOU HEAR ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW HE ACTUALLY GOT AWAY? SEEMED LIKE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GET HIM IF HE'S INSIDE THIS HOUSE. AGAIN, ALLEGEDLY, OR THE RUMOR WAS HE TRAVERSED ACROSS THE PARK, OVER A FENCE OR A GATE. THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. THERE WERE JUST VACANT LOTS. IS THE EAST AREA RAPIST SHOWING THE SAME KNOWLEDGE OF STOCKTON AS HE HAS OF SACRAMENTO? HE'S ATTACKING HERE WELL OFF THE FREEWAY. HE'S TARGETING THE SAME DEMOGRAPHIC. HE'S PATIENTLY STALKING. HE'S BLENDING IN. THIS WAS THE NICE AREA IN STOCKTON TO LIVE AT THE TIME. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OUR OFFENDER, WELL, HE'S BEING PULLED OUT TO THIS AREA TO COMMIT HIS FIRST ATTACK. THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION IS WHY? THREE WEEKS LATER, THE EAST AREA RAPIST IS BACK ON FAMILIAR TURF, COMMITTING A STRING OF ATTACKS IN SACRAMENTO. ONE THING I WANT TO EMPHASIZE, LADIES, IS FOR YOU NOT TO BE POLITE. WE'VE ALL BEEN RAISED TO NOT HURT ANYBODY, TO BE POLITE. YOU INJURE HIM ENOUGH TO INCAPACITATE HIM IN ANY WAY THAT YOU CAN. FORMER SACRAMENTO SHERIFF'S DETECTIVE CAROL DALY REMEMBERS LAW ENFORCEMENT'S FRUSTRATIONS AND LIMITATIONS. AT THE TIME OF THE EAST AREA RAPIST, WE DIDN'T HAVE CELLPHONES. SO IF WE GOT A CALL, WE HAD TO GO TO A GAS STATION, A RESTAURANT, OR A PAY PHONE, YOU KNOW, TO CALL INTO THE OFFICE. REPORTS WERE DONE ON MANUAL TYPEWRITERS. YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE DICTATION SYSTEMS. WE DIDN'T HAVE A 911 SYSTEM SET UP. WE WERE RECEIVING INFORMATION ON CASES THROUGH TELETYPE INSTEAD OF COMPUTERS AT THE TIME. YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T HAVE STREET LIGHTS. YOU DIDN'T HAVE HOUSE ALARMS. THINGS WERE SO DIFFERENT AT THE TIME. OVER THE YEARS, TECHNOLOGY HAS EVOLVED. BUT FOR CAROL, MANY THINGS REMAIN THE SAME -- HER PASSION FOR SEEING THIS CASE SOLVED AND HER CONNECTION WITH THE VICTIMS. TODAY, SHE MEETS MARGARET WARDLOW, THE EAST AREA RAPIST'S 27th VICTIM AT THE SCENE OF MARGARET'S ATTACK. IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE ALONG THE LEVEE, AND AS I'M WALKING ALONG, AND I'M LOOKING IN THE BACKYARDS, IT'S SO CLOSE THAT ALL THE RAPIST HAD TO DO WAS WALK ALONG, LOOK INSIDE WINDOWS AND DOORS OR HAVE SAT AND WATCHED WHO LIVED WHERE. YEAH, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE WAS WATCHING ME PROBABLY FOR WEEKS FROM THIS LEVEE, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO MY BEDROOM. - YES. - I'M CERTAIN OF IT. HE KNEW THAT IT WAS JUST YOU AND YOUR MOTHER. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHO LIVED THERE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT ANY SURPRISES IN THE HOUSE. HE DIDN'T WANT A THIRD PERSON BEING THERE OR ANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO CONTEND WITH. THE EAST AREA RAPIST'S ABILITY TO REMAIN INVISIBLE WHILE STALKING HIS VICTIMS IS A HAUNTING REMINDER OF HOW CALCULATING HE IS. AND HE'S ABOUT TO ADD YET ANOTHER LAYER TO HIS PSYCHOLOGICAL TORMENT. Hello? Hello? THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 2, 1978, SIX WEEKS AFTER THE ATTACK ON MARGARET WARDLOW, THE PHONE RINGS AT THE HOME OF THE EAST AREA RAPIST'S FIRST-KNOWN VICTIM. Hello? THE PHONE HAS A RECORDING DEVICE ON IT, PLACED THERE BY POLICE AFTER THE VICTIM BEGAN RECEIVING MULTIPLE CALLS FROM AN UNIDENTIFIED PERSON. SHE MANAGES TO CAPTURE THIS ONE ON TAPE. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE. THIS PHONE CALL IS ONE OF THE SCARIEST THINGS YOU'LL EVER HEAR IN YOUR LIFE. Going to kill you. AND AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THIS IS THE ONLY VERIFIED VOICE OF THE EAST AREA RAPIST THAT WE CAN LISTEN TO. WHILE THE CALL HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY ANALYZED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT, IT HAS ALSO CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF THE CIVILIAN SLEUTH COMMUNITY. AND ONE THING HAS BECOME CLEAR. THE CALLER'S VOICE ISN'T THE ONLY ONE ON THE TAPE. SO THE BACKGROUND NOISE. YOU HEAR, LIKE -- IT SOUNDS LIKE PEOPLE TALKING. I MEAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE A FEMALE VOICE IN THE BACKGROUND. IT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE CHILDREN. YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE OUT SOME WORDS, MAYBE EVEN A NAME, IT COULD BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY COULD BREAK THIS CASE OPEN. YEAH. IT MIGHT TELL US IF HE HAS A WIFE AND KIDS THAT ARE IN THE BACKGROUND TALKING, AND HE'S TRYING TO SNEAK IN A CALL. RIGHT. ...kill you. COULD THIS PREDATOR HAVE BEEN LEADING A TYPICAL LIFE SOMEWHERE IN SACRAMENTO? PERHAPS WITH A FAMILY WHO KNEW NOTHING OF HIS EVIL DEEDS? MIKE MORFORD AND KEITH KOMOS DECIDE TO SEND THE AUDIO FILE OFF TO A SPECIALIST. IT WILL TAKE SEVERAL DAYS TO GET THE ENHANCED AUDIO BACK. I JUST WANT TO GET A CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEING SAID, WHO'S IN THE BACKGROUND. WITH ONLY A HANDFUL OF CLUES IN SUCH A MASSIVE CASE, THE ONLINE COMMUNITY HAS BECOME A KEY PART OF THE INVESTIGATION, PARSING DATA, USING CROWDSOURCING, AND DIGGING DEEP FOR INFORMATION. WE'RE SITTING HERE AT 9:00 AT NIGHT WHILE THE REST OF THE WORLD IS DOING SOMETHING ELSE, GOING THROUGH THIS AND REALLY MAKING HEADWAY. IT BECOMES MORE THAN A HOBBY. IT STARTS TO BECOME A COMMUNITY. THIS CASE IS SO DIFFICULT, AND THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT FACETS TO IT, AND THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT CAN BE MADE. AND THERE'S SO MUCH TO KNOW ABOUT THE KILLER. THERE'S NO WAY THAT ONE PERSON CAN KNOW IT ALL. SINCE SO LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THIS OFFENDER, ANY CLUE COULD HAVE POTENTIAL TO SHED LIGHT ON WHO HE IS. FOR COLD-CASE INVESTIGATOR PAUL HOLES, ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE IS AMONG THE MOST COMPELLING AND INFORMATIVE. IT WAS FOUND IN 1978 DURING A POLICE SWEEP IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING ONE OF THE LATER ATTACKS IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. IT CONSISTS OF THREE PIECES OF NOTEBOOK PAPER, MOST LIKELY DROPPED ACCIDENTALLY BY THE OFFENDER. YOU IMAGINE I'VE GOT -- I'VE GOT AN OFFENDER WHO'S LEAVING A LOCATION, APPROACHING HIS VEHICLE. HE'S GOT A SKI MASK. HE'S GOT GLOVES ON. AND NOW HE'S TAKING HIS GLOVES OFF, HIS MASK OFF AS HE'S APPROACHING HIS VEHICLE AND PUTTING THEM INTO HIS BAG. I BELIEVE AT THAT POINT, THESE PIECES OF PAPER FALL OUT. AT THE TIME, THEY WERE BAGGED, TAGGED, AND PUT IN AN EVIDENCE BOX WHERE, IN 2009, PAUL UNEARTHED THEM. I OPENED UP THOSE THREE PIECES OF PAPER. TWO WERE RUDIMENTARY ESSAYS, AND ONE WAS A HAND-DRAWN DIAGRAM. AND I THOUGHT THE DIAGRAM WAS UNUSUAL LOOKING, AND I THOUGHT, "I NEED TO TAKE THESE BACK AND LOOK AT THESE MORE CAREFULLY." COULD THESE BE THE WRITINGS OF THE EAST AREA RAPIST? PERHAPS AS A YOUNG STUDENT? IN THIS PHOTOCOPY HERE, YOU'VE GOT THE TORN EDGE OUT OF THE SPIRAL. THIS FIRST ESSAY IS PROBABLY THE MOST INNOCUOUS. IT APPEARS TO BE A U.S. HISTORY ASSIGNMENT ABOUT GENERAL CUSTER. UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS AN ASSIGNMENT HE DIDN'T TURN IN, OR HE DIDN'T SIGN HIS NAME TO. THE ESSAY ITSELF HAS GRAMMATICAL ERRORS, HAS SPELLING ERRORS, BUT GENERALLY FOLLOWS A LOGICAL DEVELOPMENT ABOUT GENERAL CUSTER AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE END OF HIS CAREER. THE SECOND ESSAY THAT WAS FOUND ON THAT ESCAPE ROUTE IS WHAT I CALL THE "MAD IS THE WORD" ESSAY. AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS PROBABLY AN ASSIGNMENT WHERE THE TEACHER TOLD THE STUDENTS, "PICK A WORD AND WRITE ABOUT IT." AND THE STUDENT CHOSE THE WORD "MAD." THE AUTHOR WRITES ABOUT FEELINGS OF EXTREME ANGER DURING THE SIXTH GRADE. "I HATED THAT YEAR. WHAT REALLY BUGGED ME WAS WRITING THOSE AWFUL SENTENCES THAT MY TEACHER MADE ME WRITE. 50-100-150 SENTENCES DAY AND NIGHT. WASN'T FAIR TO MAKE ME SIT AND WRITE UNTIL MY BONES ACHED, UNTIL MY HAND FELT EVERY HORRID PAIN IT EVER HAD." THE "MAD IS THE WORD" ESSAY IS SHOWING SOMEBODY THAT HAS SOME SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES. JUST ALMOST SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL EMOTIONALLY AS THEY'RE WRITING. IN TERMS OF HOW HE'S GONNA BE SCARRED FOR LIFE FOR HAVING TO WRITE SENTENCES. BUT IF THESE ESSAYS WERE WRITTEN BY THE PERPETRATOR, THIS THIRD PIECE OF THE PUZZLE DOESN'T SEEM TO FIT. IT'S A HAND-DRAWN DIAGRAM THAT, AT FIRST GLANCE, LOOKS LIKE A MAP. WHEN I INITIALLY LOOKED AT IT, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT. THE INITIAL THOUGHT IS, IF THIS IS RELATED TO THE EAST AREA RAPIST, THIS POTENTIALLY IS MY OFFENDER DRAWING OUT A NEIGHBORHOOD, AND HE'S PLANNING HIS NEXT ATTACK. HE'S POSSIBLY TARGETED THAT HOUSE THAT'S DARKENED, AND HE'S POSSIBLY LOOKING AT INGRESS AND EGRESS ROUTES. HOW HE'S GOING TO APPROACH THE HOUSE. HOW HE'S GOING TO ESCAPE. WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S GOING TO BE RESPONDING FROM, ET CETERA. AND THEN THE BACK SIDE OF THIS DIAGRAM. YOU FLIP IT OVER, AND THE WORD "PUNISHMENT" IS SCRAWLED ON IT, AND YOU'VE GOT THE NAME "MELANIE" WRITTEN ON THERE. YOU'VE GOT THE NAME "JEN" OR "JERRY" WRITTEN ON THERE. "COME FROM." "SNELLING" OR "SMELLONY," SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THIS LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY IS SITTING THERE AND THINKING ABOUT A FUTURE VICTIM. BUT HE'S GETTING MADDER AND MADDER, AND PRETTY SOON IT'S PUNISHMENT. BUT THEN YOU START TO REALLY LOOK AT THIS DIAGRAM, AND YOU REALIZE, THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF DETAIL IN HERE THAT IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY FOR THAT TYPE OF A DRAWING. IT DOESN'T SERVE THAT PURPOSE. THERE WAS MORE TO THIS DIAGRAM. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT MORE, BUT I KNEW THAT IT WAS MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN WHAT I INITIALLY THOUGHT. INVESTIGATOR PAUL HOLES IS INTRIGUED BY A UNIQUE, HAND-DRAWN DIAGRAM THAT MAY BE KEY TO UNMASKING THE MYSTERIOUS EAST AREA RAPIST. AT FIRST, THE DIAGRAM PERPLEXES PAUL. I WAS GOING, "I HAVE NEVER DRAWN ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE." I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN DRAWN. IT SEEMS TOO DETAILED TO BE A MAP OF A POTENTIAL ATTACK. IT INCLUDES WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LAKE AND SYMBOLS THAT COULD BE HOUSES. AND THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED, THIS DIAGRAM LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY INVOLVED IN CONSTRUCTION WOULD BE DOING. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHO WOULD DRAW SOMETHING LIKE THIS, PAUL BEGINS CONSULTING EXPERTS SKILLED IN VARIOUS FACETS OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. ONE OF THOSE EXPERTS AGREES TO APPEAR ON CAMERA. LIKE I SAID... BUT ASKS TO KEEP HIS NAME AND PLACE OF BUSINESS ANONYMOUS. A DIAGRAM. NOW, WHEN I STARTED DIVING IN, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF WEIRD STUFF GOING ON INSIDE THE DIAGRAM. THE FIRST THING THAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WERE THOSE SYMBOLS. INITIALLY, I THOUGHT THEY WERE VERY JUVENILISTIC ATTEMPTS TO DRAW STICK HOUSES. THIS IS A VERY CRUDELY DRAWN RIGHT AND LEFT ELEVATION OF A TWO-STORY HOUSE. THE DRAWING ON THE LEFT IS THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WITH THE GARAGE. THIS IS THE ROOF OF THE GARAGE. THIS IS THE GARAGE ITSELF. AND THEN HERE WE HAVE TWO STORIES BEHIND THAT. RIGHT HERE ON THE DIAGRAM... I WAS NOTICING THAT THE PERSON HAD ALSO DRAWN IN SHADING BEHIND THESE HOUSES AND HAD SHORTENED THE FOOTPRINT OF THE HOUSE FROM FRONT TO BACK. ALMOST LIKE THERE'S A SLOPE IN THE BACKYARD IN THAT LOCATION. DOES THAT SEEM TO MAKE SENSE TO YOU? YEAH, YEAH. THOSE ARE WHAT WE CALL CONTOUR LINES. AND THAT KIND OF TIES IN, ALSO, ACROSS THE STREET. MOVE TO THE RIGHT WHERE WE GET DOWN TO THE LAKE. THERE ARE SOME WALKWAYS AND THAT THAT ARE DRAWN, BUT ALSO SOME OF THE LINES APPEAR TO BE CONTOUR LINES SAYING THAT THAT'S SLOPING DOWN AND INTO THE LAKE. CONTOUR LINES, ELEVATION CHANGES. IT APPEARS THAT WHOEVER DREW THIS DIAGRAM HAS MORE THAN JUST A PASSING KNOWLEDGE OF CONSTRUCTION OR DEVELOPMENT OR BOTH. AND THERE'S MORE. THE DIAGRAM APPEARS TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF HANDWRITING. WE ALSO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT CONCEPTS GOING ON ON AT THE SAME TIME ON THIS MAP THAT KIND OF TIES IN WITH YOUR TWO-PERSON THEORY IN THAT EVERYTHING THAT'S AT THE BOTTOM DOWN HERE IS DONE, WE'LL SAY, AS A MINIMALIST. IT'S MUCH CRUDER. THE LINES AREN'T AS STRAIGHT AND EVERYTHING. IT ALMOST APPEARS THAT ONE PERSON DREW THIS IN HERE WHO WAS A LAYMAN, WHEREAS SOMEONE WITH MUCH GREATER SKILLS UP IN THE OTHER COMMERCIAL AREA AND THE FIRST PHASES OF HOUSING ACTUALLY DREW SYMBOLS AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SYMBOLS. YEAH. THAT GIVES IT A CERTAIN ARCHITECTURALLY PLEASING LOOK. IT'S STILL A PRETTY CRUDE MAP, BUT IT'S AS THOUGH THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO DO THE BEST THEY COULD OR TRYING TO SHOW SOME PRIDE OF WORKMANSHIP FOR LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION. BUT THIS IS SO RADICALLY DIFFERENT THAN UP HERE. AND THAT'S AN INTERESTING OBSERVATION. POTENTIALLY, I COULD HAVE TWO INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO ACTUALLY DRAWING FEATURES ON THIS DIAGRAM IS WHAT YOU THINK. - RIGHT. OR YOU HAD ONE PERSON WHO, AT TWO DIFFERENT TIMES, HAD RADICALLY DIFFERENT MIND-SETS. SURE. COULD THIS BE THE RESULT OF A TEACHER-STUDENT COLLABORATION... ...OR A BRAINSTORMING SESSION BETWEEN COLLEAGUES? PAUL SEES AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHAKE LOOSE SOME LEADS. I RELEASE THIS TO THE PUBLIC, AND IT VERY MUCH WAS IN THE SPIRIT OF THE RELEASE THAT WE SAW WITH THE UNABOMBER'S MANIFESTO WHERE THE FBI RELEASED THAT, AND THE BROTHER OF THE UNABOMBER RECOGNIZED THE WRITING. MY HOPE WAS WAS THAT SOMEBODY WOULD RECOGNIZE THE WRITING AS WELL AS THIS PARTICULAR DIAGRAM. OR AT LEAST RECOGNIZE THE STYLISTIC ASPECTS OF THIS DIAGRAM AND GIVE ME AN INVESTIGATIVE LEAD. SO FAR, NO LUCK. BUT THANKS TO THE DIAGRAM, PAUL HAS BEEN ABLE TO HONE HIS INVESTIGATION, CERTAIN THE PERSON HE'S HUNTING IS SOMEONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCE IN CONSTRUCTION OR DEVELOPMENT. AS FOR WHY IT WAS DROPPED ALONGSIDE FAR-LESS-SOPHISTICATED SCHOOLBOY ESSAYS, THERE MAY BE A VERY SIMPLE EXPLANATION. IT COULD BE BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT MAYBE IS CHALLENGED BY SOMETHING THROUGH DYSLEXIA. OR ONE THEORY I HAVE IS YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HAD AN OLD SCHOOL SPIRAL UP ON A SHELF. AND HE HAD A BRAINSTORM SESSION AS AN ADULT AND PULLED THAT SPIRAL FROM 10 YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO, OPENED IT UP TO THE NEXT PIECE OF PAPER, AND STARTED DOING HIS BRAINSTORMING FOR HIS OCCUPATION AS AN ADULT. FOR INVESTIGATORS, THIS INFORMATION MARKS A NEW PHASE IN THE SEARCH FOR THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER. HEY. HOW ARE YOU? AND AS THEY CONTINUE TO COMB THROUGH LEADS, THE UNOFFICIAL INVESTIGATION ALSO PICKS UP STEAM. WHEN WE CAN FIND ONE THEORY AND ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT STARTS TO SUPPORT ANOTHER ONE, THINGS START TO REALLY POP AND GET EXCITING. IN THAT, I'M HEARING HER SAY, LIKE, "A PAIN IN MY OWN BACK," OR YOU KNOW, SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES THERE. WOW. THAT'S A BIG BREAKTHROUGH. CIVILIAN SLEUTHS MIKE MORFORD AND KEITH KOMOS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR AN AUDIO ANALYSIS OF THE INFAMOUS "KILL YOU" RECORDING. IT'S A CALL THE EAST AREA RAPIST MADE TO HIS FIRST-KNOWN VICTIM BEFORE HE BECAME THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER. IN THE BACKGROUND OF THIS CALL, THERE'S SOME NOISE. YOU CAN HEAR WHAT SOUNDS LIKE WOMEN TALKING OR CHILDREN OR SOMETHING. WE ALWAYS THINK OF THE OFFENDER AS A LONER, AN ANTISOCIAL PERSON WHO'S BY HIMSELF, PLANNING AND PLOTTING. BUT IF WE HAVE HIM TALKING TO SOMEBODY... ...SO MANY DIFFERENT NEW POSSIBILITIES OPEN UP. TODAY, MIKE AND KEITH CALL AUDIO TECHNICIAN BEN SEWARD FOR THE RESULTS. HEY, THIS IS KEITH. I'M HERE WITH MIKE. HEY! SO YOU CLEANED UP THE AUDIO FILE OF THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER FOR US AND DID SOME STUFF ON THE BACKGROUND. WE'RE EAGER TO HEAR IT. GREAT. WELL, I'LL PLAY IT FOR YOU. THE EXACT WORDS ARE STILL TOUGH TO MAKE OUT, BUT THE VOICE IS CLEARLY THAT OF A WOMAN. IN THAT, I'M HEARING HER SAYING, LIKE, "A PAIN IN MY OWN NECK," OR YOU KNOW, SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES THERE. COULD YOU HEAR THAT OKAY? YEAH, WE COULD HEAR IT GOOD. OKAY. THERE WAS DEFINITELY A BIG SECTION WHERE WE HAD A LOT OF AUDIO. AND THERE'S, LIKE, LITTLE SECTIONS IN THAT WHERE YOU'RE KIND OF PICKING UP, LIKE, "CALL A DOCTOR FIRST," AND -- THE PHRASES DON'T SEEM TO MAKE MUCH SENSE, BUT OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AS THE ORIGINAL RECORDING MADE THE ROUNDS ON THE INTERNET, THE ONLINE SLEUTH COMMUNITY DEVELOPED AN INTERESTING THEORY. ON PAGE A7 OF THE "SACRAMENTO UNION," JANUARY 2, 1978, WE HAVE A LISTING OF TV MOVIES. SOME PEOPLE ONLINE NOTICED THAT THE DIALOGUE FROM ONE OF THESE MOVIES SEEMS TO MATCH THE BACKGROUND OF THIS CALL. AND, INDEED, THAT SEEMS TO BE EXACTLY WHAT THE CLEAR AUDIO CONFIRMS. I WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO TAKE A SECTION OF THE MOVIE AND SYNC IT UP, AND IT CAME RIGHT IN LINE WITH THESE BACKGROUND VOICES. WOW. THAT'S -- THAT'S BIG BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN A BIG QUESTION FOR A LONG TIME NOW. SO THAT IS A -- THAT'S A BIG BREAKTHROUGH AS FAR AS GETTING THIS PHONE CALL, THE BACKGROUND RESOLUTION TO IT. RIGHT. SO IT'S DEFINITELY THE MOVIE THAT'S -- THAT'S PLAYING? YEAH. I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT OF THAT. DISCOVERING THAT THE VOICES DON'T BELONG TO A RELATIVE OR FRIEND OF THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER IS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING. YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, IF I HAD TO GUESS -- STILL, SOLVING THAT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE SHOWS THE LENGTHS CIVILIAN SLEUTHS WILL GO TO FOR ANSWERS. AWESOME WORK. THANKS, BEN. YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS. - BYE. IT'S JUST AFTER 9:00 P.M., AND BRIAN MAGGIORE, A MILITARY POLICE OFFICER, AND HIS WIFE, KATIE, ARE OUT WALKING THEIR DOG. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT ISN'T ENTIRELY CLEAR, BUT NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS LATER TELL POLICE THEY HEARD MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS, SCREAMS, AND THE UNMISTAKABLE SOUNDS OF A CHASE. WHEN THE DUST SETTLES, BRIAN AND KATIE ARE FOUND DEAD. IT APPEARS THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO IS THEY WERE OUT WALKING, AND THEY RUN ACROSS A MASKED MAN WHO'S OUT PROWLING. BRIAN MAGGIORE WAS A MILITARY POLICE OFFICER WITH AN AGGRESSIVE PERSONALITY. SO THE THOUGHT IS, IS THAT HE GOES INTO COP MODE AND CHASES AFTER THIS PROWLER THROUGH THE BACKYARD OF ONE HOUSE. AND AT THIS POINT, IT APPEARS THAT THE OFFENDER TURNS AROUND, PULLS A GUN, AND SHOOTS BRIAN. THE PROWLER CHASES DOWN KATIE AND MURDERS HER, TOO. WITNESSES DESCRIBE THE SHOOTER AS A WHITE MALE, POSSIBLY IN HIS 20s, SLENDER, WITH SANDY BLONDE HAIR. I THINK THIS IS LIKELY AN EAST AREA RAPIST HOMICIDE. THE LOCATION WHERE THIS OCCURS IS JUST A COUPLE BLOCKS WEST OF WHERE 5 OF THE FIRST 15 EAST AREA RAPIST ATTACKS OCCURRED IN CORDOVA MEADOWS NEIGHBORHOOD. SO, IT'S IN AN AREA THAT WE KNOW THAT THE EAST AREA RAPIST WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH. THE CRIME SCENE PROCESSING, NEXT TO BRIAN MAGGIORE'S BODY, THERE WAS PRE-TIED SHOELACES THAT WERE FOUND ON THE GROUND. SO, THE THOUGHT IS THAT THE OFFENDER, IN PULLING THE GUN OUT OR THE COMMOTION OF DEALING WITH BRIAN, DROPPED THESE SHOELACES. WE KNOW THAT OUR OFFENDER, THE EAST AREA RAPIST, GOLDEN STATE KILLER, WOULD BRING SHOELACES AND USE THOSE AS BINDINGS. THE KILLER WENT TO SIGNIFICANT LENGTHS TO MAKE SURE THE MAGGIORES WOULDN'T LIVE TO TELL. IT WAS DELIBERATE. IT WAS COLD-BLOODED. AND IT SHOWED HOW FAR THE OFFENDER WOULD GO TO AVOID GETTING CAUGHT. I DO THINK THAT HE'S LEAVING THAT SCENE AND IS THINKING ABOUT WHAT TRANSPIRED. AND THERE IS GOING TO PROBABLY BE FEAR AS TO WHAT HAPPENED. BUT HE MET THAT CHALLENGE. AND SO I THINK THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ALMOST PRIDE THAT HE WAS ABLE TO OVERCOME THAT CHALLENGE. IT'S BEEN 40 YEARS SINCE THE MAGGIORES BECAME THE FIRST LIKELY VICTIMS OF A BUDDING SERIAL KILLER. 40 YEARS DURING WHICH THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER HAS MANAGED TO REMAIN HIDDEN. BUT INVESTIGATORS ARE MORE DETERMINED THAN EVER TO FIND HIM AND FINALLY BRING AN END TO HIS REIGN OF TERROR. THERE IS A LOT OF OPTIMISM IN LAW-ENFORCEMENT CIRCLES RIGHT NOW THAT THIS MAY BE THE YEAR THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER IDENTIFIED. THIS IS A SOLVABLE CASE. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. WE HAVE THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER'S DNA. WE JUST HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT GUY. NEXT TIME IT'S NOT OVER"... WHEN WE START LOOKING AT THIS DIAGRAM, THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS SURROUND A LAKE. EVER SINCE YOU'VE SHOWN ME THIS MAP, I'VE BEEN BASICALLY CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS THE SUBDIVISION WHERE I LIVE. WE'VE GOT THE FIRST MURDER, AND WE'VE GOT THE ATTEMPTED MURDER. WHAT WE DID FIND INSIDE THAT VACANT APARTMENT WAS ROPE BINDINGS. SOMEBODY OUT THERE KNOWS. THEY MAY JUST NOT KNOW THAT THEY KNOW YET. THIS PARTICULAR THING THAT THEY FOUND IN THE BOTTOM OF A BOX IS THE KEY TO SOLVING THE WHOLE CASE.
