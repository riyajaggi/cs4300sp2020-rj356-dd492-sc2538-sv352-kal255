 IT'S THE SUMMER OF 1980 IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. YOUNG NEWLYWEDS KEITH AND PATRICE HARRINGTON ARE LIVING IN THE UPSCALE COSTAL TOWN OF LAGUNA NIGUEL. USING SKILLS HONED FROM YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, A MASKED INTRUDER SNEAKS INTO THEIR HOME. IT APPEARS THAT THE OFFENDER WAS ABLE TO GET IN, GET THE COUPLE BOUND. HE EXECUTES HIS CRIME IN TYPICAL FASHION. HE FORCES THE WOMAN TO TIE UP THE MAN AND BINDS THE WOMAN HIMSELF. THEN THE NEXT PHASE OF THE ATTACK.

 HE DOES SEXUALLY ASSAULT THE FEMALE IN THAT CASE. HE ORDERS THEM BOTH TO LIE IN THE BED AND COVERS THEM WITH THE BEDSPREAD. HE THEN BLUDGEONS BOTH THE MALE AND FEMALE. IT APPEARS THAT HE POSSIBLY USED A METAL SPRINKLER HEAD OR SOMETHING SIMILAR THAT WAS OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE. HE HAS EVOLVED INTO AN EFFECTIVE KILLER WHO APPEARS HELL-BENT ON ESCALATING HIS REIGN OF TERROR. HE IS BASICALLY TRYING TO DEMOLISH THIS PERSON THAT HE'S BLUDGEONING. IN THE LAST, DEADLY STAGES OF HIS RAMPAGE, CAN INVESTIGATORS EXTRACT THE CRITICAL CLUES THAT WILL FINALLY UNMASK THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER? SIX MONTHS AFTER THE MURDER OF KEITH AND PATRICE HARRINGTON,

 28-YEAR-OLD MANUELA WITTHUHN RETURNS HOME FROM VISITING HER HUSBAND, DAVE, IN THE HOSPITAL. HE WAS SICK BECAUSE HE HAD A HEART DEFECT, AND HE HAD A BACTERIAL INFECTION. THAT'S WHY HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL. HIS WHOLE LIFE WAS -- WAS THAT WAY. MANUELA WORRIES ABOUT HER HUSBAND. APART FROM HIS HEART CONDITION, THE YOUNG COUPLE HAS BEEN LIVING IN WEDDED BLISS FOR THREE YEARS. AND I WAS REALLY PROUD OF MY BOTHER. I THOUGHT, "GOSH, YOU SURE HAVE MADE IT." MANUELA DOESN'T LIKE STAYING IN THE HOUSE ALONE. USUALLY, SHE KEEPS HER PARENTS' DOG WITH HER ON NIGHTS THAT DAVE ISN'T THERE. IT WAS FIERCELY LOYAL TO HER. IT WAS JUST TOO LATE TO PICK UP THE DOG AND BRING HIM HOME. THAT NIGHT, MANUELA BRAVES BEING ALONE, ONLY TO BE CONFRONTED BY HER WORST FEARS. MANUELA HAD EVIDENCE OF BINDINGS AROUND HER WRIST AND ANKLES, AND SHE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. AFTERWARDS, THE INTRUDER FINISHES WHAT HE STARTED. HE COVERS MANUELA AND BEATS HER TO DEATH. IT APPEARS THAT HE'S USING POSSIBLY TWO WEAPONS, BUT ONE OF THE WEAPONS MAY HAVE BEEN THIS CRYSTAL GLOBE THAT WAS ON HER NIGHTSTAND THAT IS MISSING, AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS USED TO INFLICT AT LEAST ONE OF THE BLOWS TO THE BACK OF HER HEAD. MANUELA'S BODY IS DISCOVERED THE NEXT MORNING BY HER MOTHER. HER MURDER HAS HAUNTED HER LOVED ONES EVER SINCE. DAVE FELT AN INCREDIBLE SENSE OF SURVIVOR'S REMORSE. LIKE ANY GOOD HUSBAND WOULD, HE HAD SAID, "I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HOME. IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN HOME, I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO JUMP IN AND SAVE MY WIFE AND DO WHATEVER IT TOOK." I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY TO DAVE, "YOU KNOW, DAVE, IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN HOME, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN BURYING BOTH OF YOU." THE ATTACK ON MANUELA IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THOSE THAT CAME BEFORE HER. THE KILLER STICKS TO HIS SCRIPT. MANUELA IS RAPED, COVERED, AND THEN BLUDGEONED TO DEATH. BUT THIS TIME, ON HIS WAY OUT, THE MURDERER UNTIES HER AND TAKES THE BINDINGS WITH HIM. THE PREDOMINANT THEORY OF WHY HE IS EVOLVING WITH THE BINDINGS, FROM LEAVING THEM IN PLACE TO TAKING THEM WITH HIM AS HE LEAVES THE SCENE, IS THAT HE IS SOMEHOW GETTING A SENSE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT HIM THROUGH THE BINDINGS, SUCH AS RESEARCHING THE CORDAGE, WHO MANUFACTURED THE CORDAGE, WHAT TYPES OF KNOTS ARE BEING TIED. HE MAY HAVE READ SOME OF THAT IN THE NEWSPAPERS, AND THEREFORE, HE IS MODIFYING WHAT HE'S DOING -- AGAIN, FOR SELF-PRESERVATION. IT APPEARS AS IF THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER IS HONING HIS CRAFT. COVING HIS VICTIMS BEFORE KILLING THEM MAKES LESS OF A MESS. BLUDGEONING THEM IS MUCH QUIETER THAN SHOOTING. REMOVING DAMNING EVIDENCE FROM THE CRIME SCENE... ...AND ATTACKING LESS OFTEN. HE NOW MOVES FROM ATTACKING EVERY FEW WEEKS TO ONCE HE STARTS KILLING, HE'S BIANNUAL, AND SO HE'S ONLY ATTACKING TWICE A YEAR OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS. IS THE KILLER STRIKING LESS TO MINIMIZE HIS EXPOSURE? I DO THINK THAT IT'S POSSIBLE -- YOU START GETTING INTO THE MID-'80s -- THAT HE'S RECOGNIZING IT'S BECOMING TOUGHER TO COMMIT THIS CRIME AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE OF ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS IN HOME-SECURITY SYSTEMS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNOLOGIES AND FORENSICS. JUST LIKE IN HIS PAST ATTACKS, HE IS A WELL-OILED MACHINE. IT SEEMS NOTHING CAN STOP THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER. BUT THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE. BACK IN SANTA BARBARA, 35-YEAR-OLD CHERI DOMINGO AND HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER DEBBI HAVE RECENTLY MOVED INTO A NEW HOME. WE HAD A RELATIVE WHO OWNED THE HOUSE, AND HER HUSBAND HAD PASSED AWAY, AND SHE WAS GONNA SELL THE HOUSE. AND SHE WANTED TO PUT IT ON THE MARKET BUT NOT HAVE IT BE EMPTY. AND SO SHE APPROACHED MY MOM AND SAID, "CAN YOU AND DEBBI MOVE INTO THE HOUSE WHILE IT'S BEING SHOWN?" SO WE DID THAT. AND SO WE HAD BEEN THERE MAYBE 6 TO 10 WEEKS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IN LATE JULY 1981, AS SUMMER SETTLES IN, CHERI DOMINGO AND HER DAUGHTER DEBBI HAVE A TERRIBLE FIGHT. I WAS 15. IT WAS JUST BEFORE MY 16th BIRTHDAY. I TOOK OFF, AND I ENDED UP BEING GONE FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS. I WOULD GO TO A GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE AND STAY FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS, AND WHEN HER PARENTS GOT SICK OF ME, I'D GO AND MOVE ON AND STAY AT SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOUSE FOR, YOU KNOW, A FEW DAYS OR A WEEK, AND I LOOK BACK AT IT NOW AS AN ADULT, AND I THINK SHE WASN'T ASKING MUCH. SHE WAS ASKING "COME HOME AND ABIDE BY THE HOUSE RULES," AND I WAS JUST DEFIANT. AFTER A FEW WEEKS ON HER OWN, DEBBI CALLS HER MOTHER FROM A PAY PHONE. THE TWO ARGUE AGAIN. BUT THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME. I JUST SCREAMED, "WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY OUT OF MY LIFE?" AND HUNG UP THE RECEIVER. AFTER A WEEKS-LONG ARGUMENT AND STANDOFF WITH HER MOTHER, 15-YEAR-OLD DEBBI DOMINGO GETS A PHONE CALL THAT CHANGES HER LIFE FOREVER. IT WAS MY MOM'S BEST FRIEND, AND SOMEHOW SHE CAME UP WITH THE RIGHT WORDS AND THE RIGHT TONE OF VOICE AND SHE SAID, "SOMETHING'S HAPPENED, AND IT'S IMPORTANT, AND YOU NEED TO COME HOME." WHEN DEBBI ARRIVES HOME, POLICE QUICKLY USHER HER TO A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. AND, OF COURSE, MY MIND IS JUST RACING -- "WHAT'S GOING ON, AND WHY CAN'T I GO OVER THERE, AND WHERE ARE MY MOM AND GREG?" THEY SAT ME DOWN, AND THEY SAID THAT THERE WERE TWO BODIES IN THE HOUSE, AND THEY BELIEVED IT WAS MY MOM AND GREG. 27-YEAR-OLD GREG SANCHEZ IS CHERI DOMINGO'S BOYFRIEND. BOTH HAVE BEEN MURDERED. MY FRAME OF MIND AT THE TIME -- NUMBER ONE, I WAS STILL ANGRY WITH HER. I MEAN, WE'D BEEN -- I HAD JUST TOLD HER, "GET OUT OF MY LIFE," AND, YOU KNOW, NOBODY EVER DREAMS THAT -- THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE WHAT HAPPENS. AT FIRST GLANCE, THIS CRIME SCENE RESEMBLES THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER'S RECENT WORK... ...WHERE HE RAPES THE WOMAN AND BLUDGEONS THE COUPLE TO DEATH. HOWEVER, A MAJOR DIFFERENCE BECOMES CLEAR WHEN THE CORONER DISCOVERS A BULLET IN GREG'S CHEEK. COLD-CASE INVESTIGATOR JEFF KLAPAKIS PIECES TOGETHER WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED. HE PULLED A GUN AND SHOT MR. SANCHEZ ONCE IN THE FACE, CAUSING A BLOOD POOL AT THE FOOT OF THE BED. WE KNOW MR. SANCHEZ WASN'T DECEASED AT THAT POINT, BECAUSE HE APPARENTLY MOVED OVER TOWARDS THE CLOSET, WHERE THE SUSPECT BLUDGEONED HIM TO DEATH. MR. SANCHEZ DIED IN THE CLOSET AREA, AND THEN MS. DOMINGO WAS COVERED WITH BEDDING MATERIAL AND BLUDGEONED TO DEATH, AS WELL. WHY HAS THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER SUDDENLY GONE BACK TO SHOOTING HIS VICTIMS? HE HASN'T USED A GUN IN YEARS. HE HAS TO RESORT TO USING A GUN. GREG SANCHEZ GETS UP AND RUNS AT HIM, AND HE SHOOTS HIM AND CATCHES SANCHEZ IN THE LEFT CHEEK, THE BULLET EXITS OUT THE BACK OF SANCHEZ'S -- BEHIND HIS EAR, BUT IT'S A NON-FATAL WOUND. SANCHEZ PROBABLY GOES DOWN, AND HE'S ABLE TO AT LEAST GO AND INTERACT WITH THE FEMALE TO THE POINT TO WHERE WE HAVE SEMEN PRESENT. THE SEMEN IS COLLECTED FROM THE BEDSPREAD, NOT CHERI'S BODY. POLICE BELIEVE THAT IS BECAUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT, GREG SANCHEZ REGAINS CONSCIOUSNESS. AND IT APPEARS THAT HE GETS INTO A PHYSICAL STRUGGLE WITH SANCHEZ BEFORE HE KILLS HIM, AND THEN HE GOES AND KILLS CHERI DOMINGO ON THE BED AND THEN LEAVES THE HOUSE. BLUDGEONING IS THE CAUSE OF DEATH, AND WHILE HE WAS SUCCESSFUL IN KILLING HIS VICTIMS, IT'S EVIDENT THAT THIS ATTACK DID NOT GO AS PLANNED. AND FOR SANTA BARBARA DETECTIVES, IT'S AN IMPORTANT DETAIL IN ALL OF THE ATTACKS THAT OCCURRED THERE. THE SUSPECT MADE MISTAKES IN OUR CASES. IN ALL THREE CASES, THE VICTIMS ESCAPED IN SOME SHAPE OR FASHION. FIRST, IT WAS THE ATTACK IN OCTOBER OF 1979, WHEN THE COUPLE GOT AWAY. THREE MONTHS LATER, THE MANNING/OFFERMAN MURDERS, WHERE THE MALE VICTIM SLIPPED HIS TIES AND THE PERP ENDED UP SHOOTING THEM BOTH. AND NOW IT APPEARS GREG SANCHEZ HAD STOPPED HIM FROM CARRYING OUT HIS METICULOUS AND DEADLY ROUTINE. UNLESS HE PLANNED TO MAKE THOSE MISTAKES, THAT SOMETHING EXCITED HIM ABOUT A NEAR-ESCAPE OR AN ESCAPE OR WHATEVER. YOU KNOW, A PERSON MAKING A MISTAKE AFTER SO MANY PRACTICES IS UNUSUAL. WAS THE KILLER SABOTAGING HIS OWN CRIMES JUST FOR THE EXCITEMENT? IF SO, WHY DOES HE ONLY DO IT IN SANTA BARBARA? SO, WE'LL NEVER REALLY KNOW WHY HE MADE THE MISTAKES UNLESS HE TELLS US. HE IS A CALCULATING CRIMINAL. BUT COLD-CASE INVESTIGATOR PAUL HOLES ISN'T SURE HE WAS LOSING CONTROL ON PURPOSE. INSTEAD, HE BELIEVES THIS LAST ATTACK IS A SIGN THE KILLER WAS LOSING HIS TOUCH. MY THEORY IS THAT GREGORY SANCHEZ SCARED OUR OFFENDER. I THINK HE REALIZED THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN HURT BY THIS OTHER MALE THAT HE'S IN A PHYSICAL FIGHT WITH, AND HE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED OR HE COULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT. AFTER THE DOMINGO/SANCHEZ MURDERS, HE DISAPPEARS. I THINK THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER WALKED AWAY FROM DOMINGO/SANCHEZ GOING, "I'M DONE. I'M GETTING OLDER. I'M ALL ABOUT SELF-PRESERVATION. I DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT. I DON'T WANT TO BE KILLED." AND MONTHS WILL TURN INTO A YEAR BEFORE ANYONE HEARS FROM HIM AGAIN. DECADES LATER, PAUL HOLES IS STILL SCRUTINIZING THE SANTA BARBARA ATTACKS FOR CLUES. EVERY TIME I COME DOWN TO SANTA BARBARA, I WALK OR RUN WHERE ALL THE CRIME-SCENE LOCATIONS ARE, GET OUT, AND EXPLORE, 'CAUSE I'M TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT HE WAS THINKING, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HE SAW BACK IN 1979, 1980. PAUL FINDS A FOOTPATH THAT CONNECTS ALL THREE OF THE SANTA BARBARA CRIME SCENES. AS I'M DISCOVERING THIS, I'M GOING, "THIS IS SO EASY FOR HIM." HE COMES DOWN HERE, HE'S OUT PROWLING, AND HE'S GOT VICTIMS RIGHT THERE. MANY OF THESE HOUSES, YOU HAVE CLEAR VIEW INTO THEIR BACKYARDS, INTO WHAT WINDOWS ARE ON, ARE THE DRAPES OPEN. YOU CAN SEE INSIDE THE HOUSE. "CREEPER" -- IT DESCRIBES HIM PERFECTLY. THAT'S WHAT HE WAS DOING. NOW, I DON'T THINK HE'S THE ONE THAT WROTE THAT, BUT IT SHOWS A MENTALITY OF SOMEBODY WHO'S, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE KIND OF HIDING OUT UNDERNEATH THE FOOTBRIDGE AND THEY'RE PROBABLY PROWLING USING THE CREEKBED, TOO. AND THEY'RE BASICALLY SAYING, "I'M A CREEPER. I'M BACK HERE." IT'S LIKELY THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER WALKED THIS VERY PATH TO IDENTIFY HIS VICTIMS. BUT POLICE BELIEVE HE USED ANOTHER TACTIC TO PLAN HIS LAST ATTACK. SO, WE'RE HEADING BACK TO THE THIRD CRIME SCENE, WHICH IS THE DOMINGO/SANCHEZ HOMICIDE BACK ON TOLTEC WAY. AS I GO THROUGH HERE, THE HOME HERE IS ON MY LEFT. IT'S A FARMHOUSE-STYLE HOME. AND, AGAIN, IT WAS BEING -- IT WAS BEING PUT UP FOR SALE BY THE OWNERS, AND REALTORS WERE BRINGING PEOPLE IN AND OUT THE DAY BEFORE. THERE WAS AN OPEN HOUSE, AND ONE OF THE REALTORS NOTICED A PERSON CAME IN TO LOOK AT THE HOME. SHE WAS BUSY WITH ANOTHER CLIENT. AND AFTER THE PERSON LEFT, THE REALTOR STARTED NOTICING THAT WINDOW LOCKS HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM SOME OF THE WINDOWS. INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE THIS WAS THEIR KILLER FAMILIARIZING HIMSELF WITH THE HOME, DEVISING A WAY TO GET INSIDE, PLANNING HIS ATTACK IN PLAIN SIGHT. IT'S YET ANOTHER EERIE REMINDER THAT THIS PREDATOR LIVED QUIETLY AMONG HIS PREY, AS WELL AS A POSSIBLE CLUE TO HIS IDENTITY. ROUGHLY ONE YEAR AFTER THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER'S MURDEROUS RAMPAGE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, HE REACHES OUT TO A FORMER VICTIM IN SACRAMENTO. THE YOUNG WOMAN RECEIVES THE CALL AT WORK AT A LOCAL DINER. I DO BELIEVE THAT HE IS OUT AND ABOUT, PROBABLY LIVING A NORMAL LIFE. I THINK HE RAN ACROSS HER. I THINK IT WAS AN ACCIDENT OR SHE COULD HAVE SERVED HIM LUNCH. AND THEN HE WAS, LIKE, "WELL, OKAY" AND CALLED HER. SO, HE'S STILL THINKING ABOUT HER. HE'S STILL THINKING ABOUT VICTIM NUMBER 24. IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER ATTACKED HIS 24th VICTIM DURING HIS SACRAMENTO RAPE SPREE. HAS HE RETURNED TO THE CITY HE TERRORIZED YEARS BEFORE? IN ESSENCE, HE SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT, "IT'S ME. YOU KNOW, REMEMBER WHEN YOU **** MY ****. WELL, I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU DO IT AGAIN" OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. WHILE THE CALL SUGGESTS THAT THE KILLER CAN'T CONTAIN HIS URGES, HE NEVER MAKES GOOD ON THIS THREAT AND DISAPPEARS ONCE AGAIN. BUT EVENTUALLY, HIS LATENT DESIRES MANIFEST IN HIS MOST BRUTAL CRIME YET. BACK DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, FOUR YEARS AFTER THE DISTURBING PHONE CALL, 18-YEAR-OLD JANELLE CRUZ FINISHES HER SHIFT AT A LOCAL PIZZA PLACE. SHE LIVES JUST A FEW MILES FROM WHERE MANUELA WITTHUHN WAS MURDERED. SHE WAS A YEAR OLDER, SO SHE WAS MY BIG SISTER, AND SHE PROTECTED ME -- YOU KNOW, LIKE A BIG SISTER WOULD. YEAH, WE WERE VERY CLOSE. IN THE SPRING OF 1986, JANELLE IS STAYING BY HERSELF IN THE FAMILY HOME. HER SISTER MICHELLE IS OUT OF TOWN, AND HER PARENTS ARE VACATIONING IN MEXICO. SHE WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT PEOPLE TO COME OVER BECAUSE I GUESS SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE BY HERSELF BECAUSE THE NIGHT BEFORE, THEY HAD HEARD NOISES. JANELLE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER. BUT ONE NIGHT, SHE GETS THE SENSE THAT SOMEONE IS WATCHING HER. SHE WAS CALLING DIFFERENT FRIENDS. SHE HAD MADE MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO COME OVER AND STAY WITH HER OVERNIGHT SO SHE WOULDN'T BE BY HERSELF. AND SHE WENT BACK TO WORK AND HUNG OUT AT HER JOB FOR A LITTLE BIT AND MET UP WITH ONE OF HER CO-WORKERS. AND HE FOLLOWED HER BACK HOME AND THEY READ SOME POEMS AND LISTENED TO MUSIC. AT 10:30, BOTH JANELLE AND HER CO-WORKER LEAVE THE HOUSE. NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE WHERE SHE WENT. WELL, SHE MADE A PHONE CALL TO THE YOGURT SHOP, WHICH IS RIGHT DOWN THE STREET, AND WE HAD SOME FRIENDS THAT WORKED THERE. MAYBE SHE WANTED THEM TO COME OVER, OR MAYBE SHE WANTED TO GO OVER THERE AND SAY "HI." DESPITE JANELLE'S UNEASY FEELING, SHE RETURNS HOME AT 10:45. JANELLE WAS GETTING READY FOR BED. AND THE REASON THEY KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE BATHROOM, SHE HAD HER TOWEL IN THERE. YOU KNOW, THINGS WERE IN THERE. AND SO IT LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE WAS GETTING READY, YOU KNOW, FOR BED. SUDDENLY, THE KILLER SURPRISES JANELLE AND CARRIES OUT HIS SADISTIC RITUAL. JANELLE WAS BRUTALLY RAPED AND MURDERED. HE BLUDGEONS HER TO DEATH IN HER BEDROOM. I HAVE BEEN TOLD IT WAS EITHER A WRENCH OR A HAMMER. THAT'S ALL I'VE EVER BEEN TOLD. SO I DON'T KNOW. THE MURDER WEAPON HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND. SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S ANOTHER THEORY. THE DEADLY BEATING SEEMS IMPULSIVE -- PERHAPS, EVEN UNCONTROLLABLE. HER TEETH WERE KNOCKED OUT, AND THEY WERE IN HER LUNGS. WE DID NOT HAVE AN OPEN CASKET BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS UNRECOGNIZABLE. I MEAN, HE REALLY, REALLY BEAT HER GOOD. I'VE HEARD THAT SHE FOUGHT. AND I BELIEVE THAT SHE DID FIGHT BECAUSE JANELLE WAS TOUGH. YOU KNOW, SHE WAS A REALLY NICE PERSON, BUT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WOULD FIGHT IF SHE NEEDED TO. SHE WOULD FIGHT FOR ME OR HER FRIENDS. IF THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER STOPPED ATTACKING MORE THAN FIVE YEARS AGO BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT, WHY DID HE START AGAIN? FOR PAUL HOLES, THERE IS ONE REASONABLE ANSWER. HE'S DOWN IN IRVINE FOR SOME REASON, AND HE RUNS ACROSS JANELLE CRUZ. WHETHER HE'S OUT PROWLING THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND SEES HER ALONE, HE FOLLOWS HER BACK. DON'T KNOW. BUT SHE WAS A VERY ATTRACTIVE, YOUNG GIRL. FIT HIS VICTIMOLOGY PERFECTLY. AND I BELIEVE SHE WAS SOMEBODY THAT HE COULD NOT PASS UP. AND SO HE WENT AHEAD AND KILLED HER. AND AS OF RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER ATTACKS THAT HE'S COMMITTED SINCE THEN. I THINK IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT THAT WAS HIS FINAL ACT AND HE'S "I'M DONE" AT THAT POINT. THE RAPE AND MURDER OF JANELLE CRUZ IS THE LAST KNOWN ATTACK OF THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER. AND IT COULD PROVIDE A CRUCIAL CLUE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. JANELLE'S FAMILY HOME WAS FOR SALE, JUST LIKE THE HOUSE WHERE CHERI DOMINGO WAS SLAIN. THE REAL ESTATE IS INTERESTING BECAUSE OUR HOUSE WAS FOR SALE WHEN JANELLE WAS KILLED... OURS WAS, AS WELL. ...AND YOUR HOUSE WAS FOR SALE, AS WELL. SO THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THEORY. AND ALSO, IF IT WAS A REALTOR -- YOU KNOW, IT'S, LIKE, HOW WOULD THEY KNOW THAT MY PARENTS LEFT FOR CANCÃºN, UNLESS IT WAS A REALTOR WHO PUT THAT ON THE NOTES IN THE COMPUTER FOR ALL THE REALTORS TO SEE THAT, YOU KNOW, OUR FAMILY WAS GOING TO BE AWAY, SO, IF THEY HAD PROSPECTIVE BUYERS, YOU KNOW, KNOW THAT THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY AT THE TIME? RIGHT. THEY WOULD PUT THEIR NOTES ON THE MLS. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOUR HOUSE IS FOR SALE, THEY PUT THE PICTURE OF THE HOUSE ON THE MULTIPLE LISTING. THEY WOULD GO ON A LITTLE PRINTER WHERE THEY PRINT ALL THE HOUSES. YEAH, SO THE AGENTS WOULD KNOW WHAT WAS LISTED. YOU KNOW, THEY DID A PRINTOUT EVERY MORNING. AND, YOU KNOW, OUR HOUSE HAD A -- WE HAD A LOCKBOX ON THE DOORKNOB WITH KEYS. WE DID, TOO. DID YOU, AS WELL? WE DID, TOO. YOU DID? WAS THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER A REAL ESTATE AGENT? OR POSING AS A PROSPECTIVE BUYER? CITIZEN SLEUTHS MIKE MORFORD AND KEITH KOMOS FIND IT INTERESTING THAT A CALCULATING OFFENDER, ADEPT AT THROWING PEOPLE OFF HIS TRAIL, WOULD ALLOW FOR SUCH AN OBVIOUS CONNECTION TO HIS M.O. IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE WAS LEANING ON WHAT HE TYPICALLY DID. AND ALL OF HIS CRIMES UP TO THIS POINT HADN'T BEEN CONNECTED, AS FAR AS MURDERS, RAPES. THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS ALL THE SAME PERSON. SO, HE MAY HAVE FELT A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLACENT, A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE USING THE REAL ESTATE CONNECTION IN A LITTLE BIT MORE OBVIOUS WAY THAN HE HAD BEFORE. WAS THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER SLIPPING UP? IF SO, CAN HIS CARELESSNESS INADVERTENTLY REVEAL WHO HE IS? THE LAST TWO GOLDEN STATE KILLER ATTACKS OCCURRED IN HOMES THAT WERE FOR SALE. TODAY, CITIZEN SLEUTHS LOOK AT THE THEORY THAT THE PERP WAS INVOLVED IN REAL ESTATE. WELL, A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT WAYS. HE COULD HAVE BEEN A REAL ESTATE AGENT THAT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE MLS SYSTEM TO SORT OF FIND INFORMATION OUT ABOUT HIS VICTIMS. HE COULD'VE POSED AS A PROSPECTIVE BUYER AT DIFFERENT PLACES. AND HE COULD GO AROUND AND UNDO A WINDOW, UNDO A LOCK, LOOK AT THE LAYOUT OF THE HOUSE. SO THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY GOOD WAY TO... COULD THE REAL ESTATE LINK HELP THE INVESTIGATION BY LIMITING THE SUSPECT POOL? I WONDER IF REAL ESTATE LICENSES OR A REAL ESTATE DATABASE WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP US FIND REAL ESTATE AGENTS THAT WERE ACTIVE AT THE TIME, WHAT COMPANY THEY WORKED FOR, THEIR NAME, WHEN THEY GOT THEIR LICENSE, WHEN THEIR LICENSE EXPIRED. YEAH. AFTER SPENDING CONSIDERABLE TIME STUDYING THE DEVELOPMENT THEORY, INVESTIGATOR PAUL HOLES SEES ANOTHER POSSIBLE CONNECTION. WHEN I'VE DUG INTO THE DEVELOPMENT FIELD, YOU DO SEE THESE GUYS THAT ARE DEVELOPERS, BUT THEY ALSO HAVE THEIR CALIFORNIA CLASS-B CONTRACTORS LICENSE, WHICH IS YOUR GENERAL BUILDING CONTRACTORS LICENSE. AND THEY OFTEN ALSO HAVE THE REAL ESTATE LICENSE. THEY SEEM TO DO ALL OF IT. AND THAT'S ALL PART OF THE INDUSTRY. SO HE COULD HAVE HIS REAL ESTATE LICENSE. I THINK THAT IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY. COULD THE KILLER BE FOUND IN A REAL ESTATE AGENT DATABASE? CITIZEN SLEUTHS COME TO A CONCLUSION RATHER QUICKLY. ONE THING THAT I DID FIND IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF REAL ESTATE AGENTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE TIME PERIOD THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW, IRVINE WAS EXPERIENCING A HUGE BOOM IN CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE. AND IT SEEMS LIKE ALMOST EVERY RESIDENT HAD THEIR REAL ESTATE LICENSE AT THAT TIME. WITH THOUSANDS OF POTENTIAL SUSPECTS, THE REAL ESTATE CONNECTION COULD BE A RABBIT HOLE FOR INVESTIGATORS, OR IT COULD HELP THEM SOLVE THE CASE. THAT'S PART OF, YOU KNOW, DOING A WHODUNIT INVESTIGATION, IS YOU'VE GOT TO GO DOWN THESE HOLES AND FOLLOW THE TUNNELS UNTIL YOU EXHAUST THEM OR UNTIL YOU RUN ACROSS THE RABBIT. IT'S IN THIS SPIRIT THAT INVESTIGATORS CHASE ANOTHER LEAD -- ONE THAT COULD CHANGE THE SCOPE OF THE CASE AS THEY KNOW IT. THE VISALIA RANSACKER WAS A BURGLAR DOWN IN VISALIA, 1974, 1975 TIMEFRAME -- VERY PROLIFIC BURGLAR, COMMITTED OVER 100 BURGLARIES. TWO YEARS BEFORE THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER'S FIRST ATTACK, A STRING OF BREAK-INS OCCUR IN A SMALL TOWN 200 MILES SOUTH OF SACRAMENTO. THE BURGLAR IS ALWAYS MASKED AS HE SNEAKS INTO HOMES, STEALING LITTLE OF VALUE, AND SOMETIMES LEAVING SEMEN BEHIND. HE WAS A FETISH BURG. HE WOULD GO IN. HE WOULD BE PULLING OUT THE WOMAN'S UNDERGARMENTS AND LAYING THESE GARMENTS AROUND THE HOUSE. HE WAS OPENING UP PHOTO ALBUMS AND TAKING PHOTOS OF THE VICTIMS. HE WAS STEALING ODDITIES, YOU KNOW, LIKE, PIGGY BANKS AND EARRINGS AS SOUVENIRS. THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER WOULD ALSO STEAL MEMENTOS FROM HIS VICTIMS' HOMES. THERE'S SOME BEHAVIORAL OVERLAP. IT HAS TO GIVE YOU PAUSE. THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER WOULD TAKE EARRINGS AND RINGS. IN SOME SELECT INSTANCES, HE ONLY TOOK ONE OUT OF A PAIR OF EARRINGS. WE HAVE HIM GOING INTO PHOTO ALBUMS AND STEALING PHOTOS OF THE VICTIMS. IT'S ALSO FAIRLY WELL ACCEPTED AND ESTABLISHED THAT THESE FETISH BURGLARS, A PERCENTAGE OF THEM, DO ESCALATE TO RAPE. SO, YOU COULD SEE WHERE HE WOULD BE SOMEBODY THAT WOULD GRADUATE UP TO THE SEXUAL ASSAULTS. COULD THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER HAVE GOTTEN HIS START AS A BURGLAR FROM A SMALL TOWN? INVESTIGATORS FROM MANY JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING BRUCE CORRELL AND JEFF KLAPAKIS FROM SANTA BARBARA, HAVE BEEN LOOKING INTO THE THEORY FOR SOME TIME. SO, IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT THERE WAS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT THOSE CRIMES WERE CONNECTED HERE. NOW, I BELIEVE THERE HASN'T BEEN A DNA LINK TO THOSE CRIMES, HAS THERE, JEFF? NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF. NOW, THEY HAVE NOT, TO MY KNOWLEDGE, FOUND ANY FORENSIC EVIDENCE TO LINK HIM TO THAT. SO, BY THE WAY, I ALSO HAVE A MAP OF ALL THE CRIMES THAT OCCURRED IN VISALIA HERE. YEAH. AND IT'S ALL RELATIVELY CLOSE. THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. WELL, IT'S ALL RELATIVELY IN THE CENTER PORTION OF VISALIA. SAME AREA. RIGHT. SO, HE'S FAMILIAR WITH IT. SO, HE'S OUT AND ABOUT BECOMING -- EITHER PROWLING, GETTING USED TO IT, OR WHATEVER. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT HE STARTED IN VISALIA. JUST LIKE THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER, THE VISALIA RANSACKER STRIKES IN CLUSTERS. AND THERE'S ANOTHER REASON SOME INVESTIGATORS ARE CONVINCED THERE'S A CONNECTION. A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL ABDUCTED FROM HER OWN HOME, WHERE THE SUSPECT SURPRISES HER IN BED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. ON SEPTEMBER 11, 1975, HE ESCALATES. INVESTIGATORS CLOSE TO THIS CASE WONDER IF THE VISALIA RANSACKER AND THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER ARE ONE IN THE SAME. AND ON SEPTEMBER 11, 1975, OVER A YEAR INTO THE VISALIA RANSACKER'S CRIME SPREE, HE GOES FROM BURGLARY TO SOMETHING FAR MORE SINISTER AND VIOLENT. IT APPEARS THAT HE WENT IN AND ABDUCTED A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL OUT OF HER HOUSE. AND WHILE HE'S STRUGGLING TO GET HER OUT OF THE HOUSE, THE FATHER, CLAUDE SNELLING, HEARS THIS AND HE TRIES TO COME TO HIS DAUGHTER'S RESCUE, AND THE RANSACKER SHOOTS AND KILLS CLAUDE SNELLING, KICKS THE TEENAGE GIRL MULTIPLE TIMES, AND THEN RUNS OFF. POLICE WORK AROUND THE CLOCK TO FIND THE KILLER. THREE MONTHS LATER, DURING A STAKEOUT, THEY COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH HIM. THE RANSACKER TURNS, HIS MASK IS UP, SO HE GETS A GOOD LOOK AT HIS FACE. AND THE RANSACKER'S ALL, "DON'T SHOOT. DON'T SHOOT" AND THEN PULLS A GUN AND ACTUALLY SHOOTS. THE BULLET HITS AN OFFICER'S FLASHLIGHT, AND THE RANSACKER ESCAPES. AFTER THAT INCIDENT, THERE'S NO OTHER -- ANYTHING THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE RANSACKER IN VISALIA. ABOUT SIX MONTHS LATER, THE EAST AREA RAPIST SERIES STARTS UP IN SACRAMENTO. THE TIMELINE MATCHES UP, AND SO DOES THE GENERAL PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION. WHEN YOU READ THE SUMMARIES OF THE TWO OFFENDERS' DESCRIPTIONS -- 5'8", 5'10", 160, 180 POUNDS. 5'8", 5'10", 160, 180 POUNDS. YOU GET THE SENSE, "THEY BASICALLY LOOK THE SAME, IN TERMS OF THEIR PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES." IF THE VISALIA RANSACKER IS THE SAME PERSON AS THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER, IT WOULD GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT A MAJOR ADVANTAGE IN IDENTIFYING HIM. NOT ONLY DOES IT GIVE THEM ANOTHER TIME AND PLACE TO MINE FOR CLUES, BUT VISALIA IS A MUCH SMALLER TOWN THAN SACRAMENTO. IF HE'S A VISALIA NATIVE, IT'LL BE EASIER TO FIND HIM. BUT A CLOSER LOOK AT THE CASE FILES HAS PAUL HOLES QUESTIONING IF CHASING DOWN THIS LEAD IS WORTH THE TIME. IT WASN'T UNTIL I READ THE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTIONS THAT TWO INDIVIDUALS -- TWO VERY CREDIBLE WITNESSES -- RELAYED ABOUT THE VISALIA RANSACKER THAT I TOOK A STEP BACK AND I REALIZED "HOLD ON." ONE OF THE WITNESSES IS THE POLICE OFFICER WHO CAME FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE RANSACKER. AND HE PROCEEDS TO DESCRIBE THIS MAN AS HAVING A FAT, ROUND FACE, KIND OF GREASY HAIR, SHORT, STUBBY EARS, SHORT, STUBBY, FAT FINGERS, KIND OF ROUNDED, FAT SHOULDERS, FAT HUMP ON THE NECK. THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER GOT A MILITARY-LIKE BEARING. HE'S SLIM, BROAD-SHOULDERED. I'VE HAD SOME PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, IT'S JUST THE SAME PERSON. HE LOST WEIGHT OVER SIX MONTHS." AND I THINK THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS ARE NOT ATTRIBUTED TO JUST A DIFFERENCE IN WEIGHT. I THINK THERE IS A BODY-BUILD DIFFERENCE ON THE ORDER OF THE ENDOMORPH-TYPE SERIES. AND I DO NOT SEE THESE INDIVIDUALS AS BEING THE SAME. FOR PAUL HOLES, THE VISALIA RANSACKER SERIES DOES NOT FACTOR INTO HIS INVESTIGATION. INSTEAD, HE FOCUSES ON THE INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE -- DATES, LOCATIONS, ITEMS STOLEN FROM VICTIMS, THE EVIDENCE DIAGRAM, AND DNA -- THE KILLER'S GENETIC SIGNATURE. THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER'S PROFILE HAS BEEN SEARCHING AT THE NATIONAL-LEVEL DNA DATABANKS SINCE AT LEAST 2001. THAT DATABASE IS OVER 14 MILLION PROFILES, WITH NO HITS. THE DATABANKS ARE COMPRISED MOSTLY OF DNA FROM OFFENDERS AND CRIME SCENES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SO, THE PROBLEM IS, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE AN AGING OFFENDER. SO, THE LIKELIHOOD OF HIM COMMITTING A CRIME -- A FELONY TODAY -- BEING ARRESTED FOR A FELONY TODAY IN CALIFORNIA TO BE PUT INTO THE DATABASE IS DIMINISHING. I DON'T THINK HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO END UP BEING PUT IN THE DATABASE. BUT THERE IS STILL HOPE. DNA TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP. AND RECENT ADVANCES HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BROADEN THEIR SEARCH. WHAT A FAMILIAL SEARCH DOES IS, INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR THAT ONE-TO-ONE MATCH, THE STRINGENCY OF THE SEARCH IS RELAXED TO WHERE NOW, YOU'RE GETTING PEOPLE THAT HAVE CLOSE-ENOUGH PROFILES WHERE THEY MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE ONE THAT YOUR TRYING TO IDENTIFY. HIS FATHER ISN'T IN THE DATABASE. HIS FATHER LIKELY HAS DIED. SO WE'RE HOPING FOR EITHER A BROTHER WHO'S PROBABLY SIMILAR AGE OR A SON TO GET ARRESTED FOR A FELONY AND THEN BE PUT INTO THE DATABASE. AND THERE'S MORE. PARABON IS A COMPANY TAKING THE DNA LEFT AT THE CRIME SCENE AND DEVELOPING INFORMATION TO GIVE US ABOUT WHAT THE OFFENDER MIGHT LOOK LIKE, WHAT HIS EYE COLOR MIGHT BE, HOW MANY FRECKLES HE HAS, WHAT HIS HAIR COLOR MIGHT BE. IT'S STILL A MATURING TECHNOLOGY, BUT IT'S AN EXCITING TECHNOLOGY FROM MY STANDPOINT BECAUSE IT GIVES US SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE GUY. ARE YOU ABLE TO EVEN COMMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT IT'S BEING UTILIZED BY INVESTIGATORS IN... WHAT I SAY IS, WE HAVE AND CONTINUE TO EXPLORE AND UTILIZE ALL AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES. AND WE'RE HOPING TO MOVE THIS CASE FORWARD. THANK YOU. AND FINALLY, LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TURNING TO ANOTHER POWERFUL TOOL -- THE PUBLIC. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST COME TODAY... SOMEBODY OUT THERE KNOWS. THEY MAY JUST NOT KNOW THAT THEY KNOW YET, RIGHT? THE ANSWER'S OUT THERE. WE NEED A NAME. BECAUSE WHEN WE MATCH THAT NAME TO THAT PROFILE, THAT JOURNEY FOR JUSTICE WILL COME TO AN END. IF WE GET GOOD INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHO THIS GUY WAS, WHERE HE WAS, WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR, HOPEFULLY, THE RIGHT PERSON HEARS THAT AND CALLS IT IN. THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER IS A WHITE MALE. IN THE LATE 1970s, HE HAD AN ATHLETIC BUILD. THAT IS ALL POLICE KNOW FOR SURE. SO, ALL THE COMPOSITES THAT WE HAVE FROM THAT TIMEFRAME ARE FROM WITNESSES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT SAW STRANGE MEN WALKING THROUGH, EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE ATTACK. I DON'T HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE IN ANY OF THESE COMPOSITES. AND UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF THE TIPS THAT WE HAVE COMING IN ARE BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK "MY EX-BOYFRIEND" OR "MY EX-HUSBAND LOOK LIKE ONE OF THESE COMPOSITES." IN MY ASSESSMENT, THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST REPRESENTATION OF WHAT THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER LOOKED LIKE TO ALL OF OUR VICTIMS. ABSENT AN ACCURATE FACIAL DESCRIPTION, LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST RELY ON OTHER DETAILS THEY HAVE GLEANED OVER THE YEARS. OF MOST IMPORTANCE ARE HIS POTENTIAL TIES TO DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION, OR REAL ESTATE. ALSO, THAT HE LIKELY LIVED IN SACRAMENTO FROM 1976 TO 1978. AFTER THAT, IT'S POSSIBLE HIS JOB TOOK HIM TO THE TOWNS OF STOCKTON, MODESTO, DAVIS, AND THEN THE EAST BAY. FROM 1979 TO 1986, HE WAS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, FROM SANTA BARBARA TO VENTURA TO ORANGE COUNTY. THEY DON'T WANT HIM TO BE GLORIFIED. SO, YES, THE ATTENTION THAT IS GIVEN TO HIM COULD BE GOOD AND COULD BE BAD. AND I THINK THE GOOD IS THAT THE INFORMATION IS BEING PUT OUT THERE. THERE ARE LINES THAT ARE OPEN FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO CALL. THERE'S REWARDS BEING OFFERED. EXPOSING THE KILLER AND BRINGING HIM TO JUSTICE COULD END DECADES OF SUFFERING. WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN THIS CLUB. WE DIDN'T ASK TO BE. I'VE LAID IN BED WONDERING, "WHERE IS HE? WHAT'S HE DOING? WHAT IS HE DOING RIGHT THIS MINUTE?" IT COULD ALLEVIATE THE TERRIBLE FEAR HIS CRIMES HAVE INFLICTED ON SO MANY. WHENEVER I SEE SOMEONE IN BLACK HIGH-TOP SNEAKERS, IT REMINDS ME OF THE RAPIST... BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE WORE. FOR ALL WE KNOW, HE COULD BE STILL ALIVE. WE DON'T KNOW IF HE'S WATCHING US. SO, YEAH, THEY'RE FEARFUL. EVERYBODY'S FEARFUL OF, YOU KNOW, WHERE THIS GUY IS AND IF HE'S STILL CAPABLE OF HURTING THEM AGAIN. IT WOULD ALSO SHED LIGHT ON ONE OF THE DARKEST, MOST DEVASTATING CRIME SPREES THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER KNOWN. I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL CREATED WITH THE IDEA THAT WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO DO GOOD THINGS AND BE HERE FOR EACH OTHER. AND WHAT TAKES A SOUL THAT WAS CREATED FOR GOOD AND TURNS HIM INTO THAT? I WANT TO KNOW. I WANT TO KNOW.
