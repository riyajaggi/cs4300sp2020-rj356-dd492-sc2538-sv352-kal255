 MORNING. I'D -- I'D LIKE TO JUST COME TODAY FROM BOTH A PROFESSIONAL, BUT ALSO A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE ON THIS CASE. I GREW UP IN THE EAST AREA OF SACRAMENTO. WE DIDN'T LOCK OUR DOORS AT NIGHT. WE RODE OUR BIKES AROUND. IT WAS A TIME OF INNOCENCE. AND THEN IN JUNE OF 1976, THAT ALL CHANGED. A PREDATOR KNOWN AS THE EAST AREA RAPIST BRINGS TERROR TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. HE HAS A SKI MASK ON, HE HAS A GUN.

 HE KNEW THAT THERE WAS NO DEFENSE. ALL I KNEW WAS FEAR. FROM 1976 TO 1978, THE MASKED ATTACKER RAPES 50 WOMEN IN THEIR QUIET SUBURBAN HOMES. THESE ARE PEOPLE SLEEPING IN THEIR HOUSES. ANYBODY COULD BECOME A VICTIM. YOU MUST INJURE YOUR ATTACKER TO INCAPACITATE HIM IN ANY WAY THAT YOU CAN. A FEW YEARS LATER, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FACES ITS OWN NIGHTMARE WHEN A PROWLER CALLED THE ORIGINAL NIGHT STALKER STRIKES, KILLING 10 PEOPLE. MORE THAN 100 DETECTIVES HAVE BEEN HUNTING THIS GUY AND NO ONE HAS A CLUE WHO HE IS. IN 2001, LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SHOCKED

 WHEN DNA PROVES THAT ALL THE RAPES AND MURDERS WERE COMMITTED BY ONE MAN, EARNING ONE OF THE FBI'S MOST WANTED A NEW NAME, THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER. THAT INDIVIDUAL IS ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC SERIAL KILLERS IN THE HISTORY OF THIS STATE, IF NOT, IN THIS NATION. NOW, AN INVESTIGATION SPANNING FOUR DECADES IS PICKING UP STEAM. THE ANSWER'S OUT THERE. WE NEED A NAME. BUT CAN THEY CATCH HIM BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT? SOME OF THESE VICTIMS THINK THAT THIS GUY'S STILL GONNA COME BACK AND GET THEM, AND THEY'RE SCARED. HE IS A NIGHTMARE COME TO LIFE, AND HE COULD BE ANYWHERE. ON THE MORNING OF JULY 27, 1981, 15-YEAR-OLD DEBBI DOMINGO IS AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE. SHE GETS A PHONE CALL FROM A NEIGHBOR TO COME HOME IMMEDIATELY. I GOT TO THE CUL-DE-SAC, AND I'M LOOKING, AND THERE'S THAT YELLOW TAPE. AND I THOUGHT, "MAN, YOU KNOW, YELLOW TAPE, EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY DEAD OR SOMETHING -- SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED." DEBBI'S MOTHER, 35-YEAR-OLD CHERI DOMINGO, AND HER BOYFRIEND, 27-YEAR-OLD GREG SANCHEZ, HAD BEEN FOUND DEAD. I JUST KEPT WANTING TO GO INTO THE HOUSE. I WANTED TO GO INTO MY BEDROOM. I DON'T THINK I EVER EVEN GOT TO GO INTO MY BEDROOM AGAIN, MUCH LESS HERS. AND SO I'VE ALWAYS -- ALWAYS HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT REALLY, WHAT THE CRIME SCENE LOOKED LIKE AND -- AND HOW -- HOW GRUESOME WAS IT? I'VE HEARD -- I'VE HEARD ABOUT HOW GRUESOME IT WAS, BUT I -- BUT THE IMAGINATION IS JUST... AND I GUESS THAT'S OKAY. CHERI AND GREG'S KILLER HAS ESCAPED DETECTION FOR 36 YEARS. BUT POLICE HOPE THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE. IN 2015, THE FBI OFFERED A $50,000 REWARD FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE CAPTURE OF THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER. THE OFFER AND THE ENSUING MEDIA FRENZY HAVE PUT THIS CASE IN THE SPOTLIGHT. TODAY, A MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL MANHUNT FOR THE NOTORIOUS KILLER IS WORKING ON OVERDRIVE AS DETECTIVES GET CLOSER TO FINDING HIM. IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY, WHERE NINE OF THE BRUTAL ATTACKS OCCURRED, COLD-CASE INVESTIGATOR PAUL HOLES HEADS UP THE INVESTIGATION. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS CASE FOR 23 YEARS. I WAS JUST STARTING MY CAREER, AND I WAS STARTING TO READ UP ON SERIAL PREDATORS. AND I WAS FASCINATED WITH COLD CASES, SO I THOUGHT, "WELL, HERE'S A COLD CASE. IT'S OBVIOUSLY A SERIAL PREDATOR. LET'S SEE WHAT I CAN DO WITH IT." BUT OVER TIME, IN READING WHAT THIS GUY DID AND SEEING THE DEVASTATION THAT HE WRECKED ACROSS CALIFORNIA, YOU ALMOST HAVE A PERSONAL OBLIGATION. YOU'VE GOT TO CATCH THIS GUY NOW. THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE IS HUGE, IT'S STAGGERING. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST SERIAL PREDATORS THAT I'M AWARE OF. THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER SERIES STARTED IN JUNE OF 1976 UP IN SACRAMENTO. HE COMMITTED 50 ATTACKS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, ALL INVOLVING SEXUAL ASSAULTS OF FEMALES AND THEN DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, HE KILLED 10 PEOPLE. I'VE TALKED TO MULTIPLE VICTIMS IN THE CASE. I SEE HOW THEY'RE TRAUMATIZED STILL, TO THIS DAY, AND HOW MUCH THEY NEED TO FEEL SAFE. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS GUY VERY LIKELY IS STILL ALIVE, BASED ON WHAT HIS CHRONOLOGICAL AGE MOST LIKELY IS, BETWEEN ROUGHLY 60 TO 70 YEARS OLD, AND I THINK WE ARE CLOSER THAN EVER BEFORE. THERE ARE NO SHORTCUTS IN SOLVING A CRIME SPREE OF THIS MAGNITUDE. TO DEVELOP NEW LEADS, INVESTIGATORS MUST DECONSTRUCT HIS M.O., FOLLOW THE ESCALATION OF HIS ATTACKS, AND SCRUTINIZE THE EVIDENCE HE LEFT BEHIND. SO, THEY RETRACED THE GOLDEN STATE KILLER'S CRIMES STARTING FROM THE BEGINNING, WHEN HE WAS KNOWN AS THE EAST AREA RAPIST. WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR 48 YEARS. AT THE TIME THE RAPES WERE GOING, THIS IS WHERE WE LIVED. I DOUBLE-CHECK EVERYTHING. WE KEEP LIGHTS ON ALL AROUND. AND THAT'S WHAT WE TOLD PEOPLE AT THE TIME, LOCK YOUR DOORS, LOCK YOUR WINDOWS. CAROL DALY, A RETIRED DETECTIVE WITH THE SACRAMENTO SHERIFF'S OFFICE, PROVIDES INVALUABLE INSIGHT INTO THE EARLY ATTACKS. I HAVE THE NOTEBOOK THAT I HAVE KEPT OVER ALL OF THE YEARS OF TIDBITS OF INFORMATION ON THE EAST AREA RAPIST AND SO, IT JUST STAYS FRESH IN MY MIND. I HAVE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ON ALL OF THE OFFICERS AND THE PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS THAT HAVE WORKED ON THE CASE, ALL OF THE VICTIMS, THEIR ADDRESSES, DATES, AND TIMES. AND I AM NOT ABLE TO SHOW THIS TO YOU. THIS IS A SYNOPSIS I PUT TOGETHER, THE COUPLE OF YEARS OF WORKING THE CASES, OF EVERYTHING WE DID TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THE EAST AREA RAPIST. THAT WAS ME AT THE TIME OF THE INVESTIGATIONS. MY BULL BARREL AND MY GUN. THE RANGE MASTER ALWAYS MADE SURE I HAD THE BEST FIREPOWER I COULD, 'CAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE AUTOMATICS AT THE TIME. CAROL DALY'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE CASE IS IMMEASURABLE AND HER REPORTS ARE AMAZING. SHE DID A TREMENDOUS JOB OF CAPTURING ALL THIS DETAIL ABOUT THE OFFENDER. AND THAT GIVES ME A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHO THIS GUY IS, AS WELL AS WHO THE FEMALE VICTIMS WERE. I THINK SHE BONDED WITH THE VICTIMS AND SHE WAS ABLE TO GET THEM TO FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS GUY HAD DONE TO THEM. IT TOOK US MAYBE INTO THE FOURTH AND FIFTH RAPE BEFORE WE REALIZED THAT WE REALLY HAD A SERIES GOING. WE HAD A MAN WHO WAS ASSAULTING WITH THE SAME METHOD OF OPERATION, AND IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER RAPES. IT WAS ALWAYS A SURPRISE ATTACK. THEY WERE SLEEPING, HE'S AT THE FOOT OF THE BED, FLASHLIGHT SHINING IN THEIR EYES. OFTEN, HE HAD A GUN, HE ALWAYS WORE A SKI MASK. AND HE WOULD BE BACK AND FORTH, TORMENTING THE VICTIM, TYING, UNTYING, RAPING, SEXUALLY ASSAULTING, MAKING THREATS TO HER THROUGH CLENCHED TEETH IN A HOARSE WHISPER. YOU KNOW, "DON'T MOVE, DON'T MOVE, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU, DON'T MOVE, I TOLD YOU NOT TO MOVE." I will kill you if you move! ** THE FIRST CRIME SCENE THAT I RESPONDED TO WAS THE JANE CARSON CASE. OUR HOUSE WAS IN CITRUS HEIGHTS. IT WAS ABOUT 30 MINUTES FROM SACRAMENTO. IT WAS THE FIRST HOME THAT WE HAD EVER OWNED, AND IT WAS A NICE, FRIENDLY, QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD. I WAS 30 YEARS OLD, A MOTHER OF A 3-YEAR-OLD, A WIFE OF A MILITARY OFFICER. AND I WAS ALSO ATTENDING SCHOOL GETTING MY NURSING DEGREE. I WAS VICTIM NUMBER FIVE. ** IT WAS 6:30 IN THE MORNING. I WAS SNUGGLING WITH MY SON. I HEARD THE GARAGE DOOR CLOSE, AND I KNEW THAT MY HUSBAND HAD LEFT FOR WORK. AND WITHIN TWO MINUTES, I HEARD FOOTSTEPS COMING TOWARD MY BEDROOM. THE NEXT THING I KNEW, THERE HE WAS SHINING THIS LIGHT IN MY EYES, AND ALL I COULD SEE WAS HIS SKI MASK AND A BUTCHER KNIFE. AND HE SAID, "SHUT UP, SHUT UP, OR I'LL KILL YOU," WITH CLENCHED TEETH. SO, YOU COULD IMAGINE THE FEAR, ESPECIALLY WITH MY 3-YEAR-OLD SON LAYING NEXT TO ME. THEN HE STARTED TO TIE US BOTH UP. HE TIED MY ANKLES, TIED MY WRISTS, BLINDFOLDED ME, AND STUFFED WASHCLOTHS IN MY MOUTH SO I COULDN'T TALK. THEN HE PROCEEDED TO DO THE SAME TO MY SON. ** IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE, ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR 3-YEAR-OLD LAYING NEXT TO YOU. IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE THE FEAR. THEN HE PROCEEDED TO UNTIE MY ANKLES AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW WHAT HE WAS THERE FOR. Don't make me hurt your son! AND THEN I WENT TO TOUCH MY SON NEXT TO ME, AND HE WAS GONE. NOW, WHAT DID HE DO WITH HIM? WHERE DID HE PUT HIM? WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO NEXT? ALL I KNEW WAS FEAR. ** ** MY HEART WAS BEATING SO FAST, IT ALMOST WENT THROUGH MY CHEST. ON OCTOBER 5, 1976, JANE CARSON IS THE EAST AREA RAPIST'S FIFTH VICTIM. DURING THE COURSE OF THE ATTACK, JANE REALIZES HER 3-YEAR-OLD SON HAS GONE MISSING FROM HER SIDE. Shut up. AFTER HE RAPED ME, MY FOCUS WAS ON, WHERE'S MY SON, AND WHAT'S THIS CRAZY GUY GOING TO DO NEXT? THEN HE WENT INTO THE KITCHEN. HE STARTED TO RATTLE POTS AND PANS AND OPEN THE REFRIGERATOR AND -- AND THEN HE'D COME BACK AND CHECK ON ME. AND AGAIN, SAYING, "IF YOU MOVE, YOU KNOW, IF I HEAR ANYTHING IN HERE, I'M GOING TO COME BACK AND KILL YOU." HE TOOK MULTIPLE TRIPS BACK AND FORTH, THE REFRIGERATOR, POTS AND PANS. ** AFTER A WHILE, I WAS ABLE TO GET MY BLINDFOLD DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND I THOUGHT, I HADN'T HEARD ANYTHING FOR A WHILE AND I SAW THAT HE HAD PUT MY SON BACK NEXT TO ME. ** JANE BELIEVES THE RAPIST WAS IN HER HOME FOR NEARLY TWO HOURS BEFORE HE FINALLY LEFT QUIETLY. THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE EAST AREA RAPIST SPENT IN THE HOME WAS VERY UNUSUAL FROM ANY OTHER RAPES THAT WE HAD. YOUR RAPES, A LOT OF THEM, COME IN THROUGH AN UNLOCKED DOOR, AN UNLOCKED WINDOW. THERE'S A RAPE, MAYBE THERE'S A THEFT, AND THEN THEY'RE GONE. WITH THE EAST AREA RAPIST, HE USUALLY SPENT TWO OR THREE HOURS IN THE HOME, MAKING THREATS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ORDEAL. THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THE VICTIMS WERE SURE THE RAPIST HAD LEFT THE HOME, BUT WHEN THEY STARTED TO MOVE, HE WAS RIGHT THERE. I told you not to move! ALL I EVER WANT HIM TO KNOW IS THE FEAR THAT HE PUT ME THROUGH, AND I JUST WANT TO ASK HIM QUESTIONS. WHERE DID YOU SEE ME? HOW LONG HAD YOU STALKED ME? UM, YOU KNOW, KIND OF, WHY ME? WHEN JANE WAS ABLE TO GET FREE, SHE CALLED FOR HELP AND THE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBORS HAD TO COME AND UNTIE HER. AND SO, WE ENCOUNTERED HER AT A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. MY PURPOSE FOR BEING AT THE CRIME SCENE WAS TO BE WITH HER, TO GIVE HER ALL OF THE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THAT WE COULD, TO ACCOMPANY HER TO THE HOSPITAL WHERE THE EXAMINATION WAS GOING TO BE HELD AND INTERVIEW HER, TO GET AS MANY DETAILS OF THE CASE AS WE COULD. MY MAIN FOCUS WAS TRYING TO GET DOWN TO ALL OF THE DETAILS, ANYTHING THAT WE COULD TO GET THE SUSPECT IDENTIFIED. VICTIMS DESCRIBE THE ATTACKER AS A WHITE MALE, 5'9", ABOUT 165 POUNDS, WITH AN ATHLETIC BUILD. BASED ON THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE, THEY ESTIMATE HIS AGE TO BE ANYWHERE FROM 18 TO 30. WHEN YOU'RE INTERVIEWING A RAPE VICTIM, THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT HAVE TO BE ASKED TO GET THEM TO BE AS OPEN AS THEY COULD. VERY DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT A SEXUAL ASSAULT. I WOULD HAVE THEM TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED AND THEN I WOULD SAY, YOU KNOW, "WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?" SOME OF THE VICTIMS FELT THAT HE WAS SO IMMATURELY SMALL IN THE PENIS, WHICH BECAME A BIG ISSUE IN THIS INVESTIGATION. AND, YES, I KNOW OF ONE VICTIM WHO, TO THIS DAY, HAS NEVER ADMITTED THAT ORAL COPULATION WAS A PART OF THE ACT, BECAUSE IT WAS JUST SO EMBARRASSING TO HER. SO, AS MUCH AS YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING THOROUGH AND GETTING ALL OF THE INFORMATION, YEARS LATER, YOU KNOW THAT THERE WAS STILL SOMETHING THAT THE VICTIM DID NOT WANT TO COME FORWARD WITH, BECAUSE IT WAS SO EMBARRASSING. AFTER THE ATTACK ON JANE, THE RAPIST CONTINUES TO STRIKE SACRAMENTO AT AN ALARMING RATE, AS OFTEN AS ONCE A WEEK. OVER TIME, HIS IDIOSYNCRASIES BECOME CLEAR. PART OF HIS M.O. WAS THAT HE ALWAYS STOLE THINGS, YOU KNOW, FROM THE HOUSE. SO, THERE WERE DRIVER'S LICENSES, THERE WERE PHOTOS, THERE WAS JEWELRY, THERE WAS MONEY. THIS HAPPENED TO BE SOME OF THE VICTIM'S JEWELRY BOXES, THAT THE OFFENDER RIFFLED THROUGH. AND HE STOLE, WHAT I CALL INDICIA, THE VARIOUS CARDS AND OTHER MATERIALS THAT WERE IN THE VICTIM'S WALLET. SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT HE STOLE ARE VERY UNIQUE, SOME OF 'EM HAVE NAMES ON 'EM, SOME OF 'EM HAVE INITIALS ON 'EM, WEDDING DATES ON 'EM. HE TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OUT OF PHOTO ALBUMS. THOSE ITEMS ARE SOMETHING THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY ON THE LOOKOUT FOR. DETECTIVES SCOUR THE CRIME SCENES FOR FINGERPRINTS, BUT THE RAPIST ALMOST ALWAYS WEARS GLOVES. STILL, HE LEAVES OTHER CLUES BEHIND, WHICH PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO WHO HE IS. WE HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH OF A PEPSI CAN DISCARDED OUT ON THE REAR PATIO. THE EAST AREA RAPIST WOULD TYPICALLY DRINK OR EAT THE VICTIM'S FOOD. IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS, HE'S GOT CONTROL, HE'S GOT POWER OVER THE VICTIMS, AND NOW HE'S GOING TO MAKE HIMSELF AT HOME. PIECING TOGETHER THE CLUES LEFT BEHIND BY THE EAST AREA RAPIST COULD BE THE ANSWER TO CATCHING HIM. AND THE CASE IS SO COMPLEX, EVEN PRIVATE CITIZENS HAVE BECOME OBSESSED WITH SOLVING IT. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE STARTED UP THEIR OWN PERSONAL INVESTIGATIONS AND GOT THEIR OWN THEORIES, THEY'RE SENDING US INFORMATION. TRUE-CRIME AUTHOR MICHELLE McNAMARA WORKED THIS CASE FOR YEARS ON HER OWN, SENDING LAW ENFORCEMENT TIPS AS SHE UNCOVERED THEM. McNAMARA DIED UNEXPECTEDLY IN 2016. BUT A COMMUNITY OF DEDICATED CITIZEN SLEUTHS CONTINUES TO STUDY THE CASE. SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY BRIGHT, AND THEY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INVESTIGATION. MIKE MORFORD IS A TRUE-CRIME BLOGGER AND PODCAST HOST. THIS CASE IS ONE WHERE YOU START LOOKING AT A MAP, START LOOKING AT SOME LOCATIONS, AND THEN THINGS START PLAYING IN YOUR MIND AND THEN YOU START GETTING THE BUG TO SEEING IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT SOMETHING TO SOLVE IT. BY DAY, KEITH KOMOS CREATES WEBSITES FOR UNIVERSITIES, BUT AT NIGHT, HE PUTS HIS TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO OTHER USE, CHASING DOWN LEADS IN THE CASE. WHAT'S CRAZY ABOUT THIS CASE IS THAT THERE'S SO MUCH INFORMATION. THERE ARE SO MANY ATTACKS AND THERE ARE SO MANY LEADS THAT HAVE BEEN UNFOLLOWED, THAT IT COULD VERY EASILY BE SOME SORT OF CITIZEN SLEUTH THAT UNCOVERS A LEAD THAT'S ABLE TO ACTUALLY SOLVE THIS CASE. CITIZEN SLEUTHS OFTEN TEAM UP TO WORK INTERESTING LEADS TOGETHER, IN THIS CASE, LOOKING INTO A PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT WAS FOUND NEAR ONE OF THE CRIME SCENES IN 1978. ALL RIGHT. DID YOU GET MY E-MAIL? I DID. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THIS BADGE. YEAH, I BROUGHT THE -- THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE BADGE. WOW. YEAH, THAT'S DEFINITELY A LOT, BETTER VERSION THAN I'VE SEEN BEFORE. THE BADGE IS ONE OF A FEW PIECES OF EVIDENCE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PIECES OF EVIDENCE, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT VERY LITTLE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS I THINK THERE ARE STILL SOME LEADS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN EXHAUSTED YET, SO HOPEFULLY, THIS COULD LEAD US TO SOMETHING. MIKE AND KEITH WONDER IF THE BADGE COULD'VE BEEN DROPPED BY THE EAST AREA RAPIST, AND IF SO, COULD IT TELL THEM ANYTHING ABOUT HIS OCCUPATION? ANY ONE OF THESE SMALL PIECES OF EVIDENCE COULD BE THAT ONE THING THAT BLOWS THE CASE WIDE OPEN. CITIZEN SLEUTHS MIKE MORFORD AND KEITH KOMOS ARE FOLLOWING UP ON A BADGE THAT WAS FOUND IN 1978 BY AN EAST AREA RAPIST CRIME SCENE. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT AWAY IS THAT IT'S A SEVEN-POINT STAR. YEAH. IT'S GOT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOGO RIGHT ON THERE, SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE SOME OFFICIAL SORT OF BADGE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT DOES, IT SAYS, "SPECIAL OFFICER" AROUND THE SIDE. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A SPOT FOR, LIKE, A SERIAL NUMBER OR BADGE NUMBER, BUT THERE ISN'T ONE PRESENT. WE HAVE SOME AVENUES THAT WE CAN EXPLORE TO TRY AND FIND OUT THE ORIGINS OF THIS. MAYBE CONTACT SOMEBODY THAT COLLECTS OR SPECIALIZES IN BADGES. YEAH, A COLLECTOR, A LAW-ENFORCEMENT HISTORIAN, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER DEFINITIVELY IS WHETHER IT COULD LEAD US TOWARD HIM HAVING A CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT? OBVIOUSLY, IF WE COULD DISCOVER HIS OCCUPATION, IT COULD PRETTY MUCH LEAD US TO HIS DOORSTEP. WAS THE EAST AREA RAPIST A POLICE OFFICER? IT'S A THEORY THAT INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT THOUGHT HE WAS IN A LAW-ENFORCEMENT CIRCLE, BECAUSE HE KNEW EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON, OR SEEMED TO. FOR EXAMPLE, THE OFFENDER ALWAYS MANAGED TO OUTWIT POLICE EFFORTS. WE STARTED USING PATROL OFFICERS IN PLAINCLOTHES WHO RODE BICYCLES IN THE RANCHO CORDOVA AREA AND ON THE AMERICAN RIVER LEVEE. IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY, YOU HAVE THE AMERICAN RIVER THAT COMES DOWN AND SPLITS THE COUNTY, SO YOU HAVE ONLY FOUR WAYS TO GET ACROSS THE RIVER. SO, WE HAD SURVEILLANCE CARS ON BRIDGES IN CASE A RAPE CALL WENT OUT AND THEY COULD RECORD LICENSE PLATES IN TRYING TO IDENTIFY HIM. DESPITE 'ROUND THE CLOCK STAKEOUTS, THE EAST AREA RAPIST IS NEVER APPREHENDED. THERE WERE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN OFFICERS FELT THEY SAW HIM, AND HE WOULD SIMPLY JUST DISAPPEAR. HE WAS SO FAST. HE WAS JUMPING FENCES, HE WAS IN PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS, AND THEY WOULD SEE HIM AND THEN HE WOULD BE GONE. SO, WE KNEW THAT HE WAS VERY, VERY AGILE. THE PERP WAS KNOWN NOT ONLY FOR HIS PHYSICAL AGILITY, BUT ALSO FOR CAREFULLY PLANNING HIS ATTACKS. BOTH ARE SKILLS THAT COULD'VE BEEN LEARNED IN TACTICAL TRAINING. TODAY, COLD-CASE INVESTIGATOR PAUL HOLES CONTINUES HIS QUEST TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE OFFENDER'S STALKING STRATEGIES. IT'S THIS NEXT INTERSECTION. I'VE MADE IT A POINT TO VISIT EVERY SINGLE CRIME SCENE IN THE SERIES AND MANY OF THESE CRIME SCENES I REPEATEDLY REVISIT. I START PUTTING MYSELF IN THE MIND OF THE EAST AREA RAPIST. WHY THIS LOCATION? WAS IT MORE SECLUDED? DID HE HAVE EASIER ACCESS? DID HE HAVE A VANTAGE POINT WHERE HE COULD SEE WHERE THE PARENTS ARE, WHERE THE KIDS ARE, WHAT THEY'RE DOING? THE RAPIST'S CALCULATED APPROACH TO HIS CRIMES CERTAINLY INDICATES A SKILL LEVEL ABOVE THAT OF YOUR AVERAGE STALKER. HE DEMONSTRATES IN SELECT INSTANCES HAVING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INTEL ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE THESE HOUSES AND THE MOST NOTABLE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THIS ATTACK NUMBER NINE UP IN SACRAMENTO. ABOUT 6:30 IN THE EVENING, A TEENAGE GIRL IS LEFT HOME ALONE. SHE'S SUPPOSED TO GO OUT ON A DATE WITH HER BOYFRIEND THAT NIGHT. SO, BEFORE HER PARENTS CAME HOME, SHE WAS GOING TO BE GONE. THE OFFENDER COMES IN AND IMMEDIATELY PULLS HER OUTSIDE THE HOUSE TO HER BACKYARD, WHERE HE BINDS HER UP. HE GOES BACK INSIDE THE HOUSE, HE TURNS THE TV OFF, HE LOCKS THE DOORS. HE PUTS THE WINDOW SCREEN BACK ON THE WINDOW THAT HE HAD USED TO GET INSIDE THE HOUSE AND SETS THE HOUSE TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE VICTIM HAD LEFT. HE THEN TAKES THE VICTIM INTO A CANAL AND WALKS HER 200 YARDS AWAY, GETS HER AWAY FROM WHERE HER PARENTS ARE GOING TO BE RETURNING. SO, NOW HE'S GOT HER ISOLATED SO HE CAN SPEND TIME WITH HER, BUT HE'S TAKEN THE TIME TO SET THE HOUSE UP, SO THE PARENTS WOULD JUST ASSUME THEIR DAUGHTER WAS OUT ON A DATE. HOW DID HE KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THAT HOUSE? I THINK HE'S A VERY ORGANIZED OFFENDER. I BELIEVE HE'S SOMEBODY THAT PROBABLY TOOK NOTES WHILE HE WAS OUT PROWLING, IN FACT, PENS ARE ACTUALLY COLLECTED AT TWO OF THE SACRAMENTO SITES. AND SO, I THINK HE'S MAKING NOTES ABOUT HOW THE HOUSE IS LOCKED UP, WHAT KIND OF VISIBILITY, YOU KNOW, HOW HE'S GOING TO APPROACH THE HOUSE OR LEAVE THE HOUSE. AND HE PROBABLY HAD MULTIPLE NEIGHBORHOODS PROWLED AT ANY ONE POINT IN TIME, AND HE TOOK NOTES TO KEEP EVERYTHING STRAIGHT. AFTER 13 ATTACKS, POLICE ARE CONVINCED THEY'RE DEALING WITH A SOPHISTICATED OFFENDER. BUT IN FEBRUARY 1977, HE'S PUT TO THE TEST WHEN HE COMES FACE-TO-FACE WITH A YOUNG CROSS-COUNTRY RUNNER NAMED RODNEY MILLER. I WAS 17 YEARS OLD WHEN IT HAPPENED. IT WAS UNREAL. I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT WE REALLY WENT THROUGH. SHE HEARD SOMETHING OUT IN THE BACKYARD. - I HEARD A CLACK ON OUR -- - SMOKER BARREL. THAT SMOKER BARREL OUT THERE. - SMOKER BARREL, RIGHT. I LOOKED AND THERE WAS A GUY WITH A HOODIE ON, AND HE RAN INTO OUR BACKYARD AND OUT. SO, I CALLED YOU -- - I SEEN HIM. - AND YOU SAW HIM. - YEAH. AND YOU WENT AND CHASED HIM. SO, I THOUGHT, TOO, THAT IF ROD WOULD GET HIM, WE'D TAKE HIM HOME, AND TELL HIS PARENTS, "THIS KID'S BEEN..." "YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY BACKYARD?" BUT, WE DIDN'T GET THAT FAR. WE GOT THE WORST END OF IT. TOOK OFF RUNNING DOWN, JUMPED OVER THE FENCE RIGHT OVER THERE IN THE NEIGHBOR'S YARD. I FIGURED HE'S GOING TO JUMP BACK OUT IN THE COURT. SO, I PEELED OFF BACK THIS WAY. AND I SEEN HIM, HE CAME OUT TWO DOORS DOWN, OVER THEIR FENCE IN THE FRONT AND RAN IN THE COURT. I WAS RIGHT HERE LOOKING RIGHT AT HIM AND IT WAS A GUY ABOUT MY AGE OR SO AND SIZE. I SAID, "WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?" AND HE WAS HOPPING BACK AND FORTH, DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTED TO DO, RUN THAT WAY OR THIS WAY. AND I SAID, HELL WITH IT, AND I STARTED RUNNING RIGHT AT HIM. HE TOOK OFF RUNNING AROUND THE HOUSE. THAT'S WHERE I GRABBED HIM BEFORE HE WENT OVER THE FENCE. CAUGHT HIS FOOT, AND HE WENT DOWN AND FELL. AND I JUMPED UP AND GETTING READY TO ROLL OVER ON HIM. AND I HEARD THE CLICK, BUT I COULDN'T STOP. AND THEN THE SHOT HIT ME, AND THEN I FOUND MYSELF 20 FEET BACK ON THE GROUND. THE BULLET WENT IN RIGHT THERE. THAT'S THE, YOU KNOW, HOLE. YEAH, WELL, IT'S RIGHT UP THE BELLY BUTTON, AND ALL THE WAY DOWN JUST AS FAR AS YOU CAN CUT. RIGHT. IT WAS REALLY KIND OF AN EXPERIENCE, KIND OF SCARY, BUT... IT'S OKAY. SO, THAT PERSON WAS LAYING IN THE IVY. IT WAS ALL INDENTED, AND SO THEY KNEW HE WAS THERE FOR QUITE A WHILE INVESTIGATING THIS AREA. HE WAS DOING HIS SURVEILLING. YOU KNOW, THE POLICE, THEY TOOK PICTURES OF THE FOOTPRINTS THAT WAS IN THE MUD BACK THERE. - THAT'S RIGHT. - YES, EXACTLY. AND THEY CHECKED IT WITH THE FOOTPRINT OF THE EAST AREA RAPIST THAT THEY HAD FOUND AND WAS IDENTICAL. IT WAS IDENTICAL. THE SHOE PRINTS WERE IDENTICAL. YOU NEVER KNOW, YOU KNOW, WHO HE WAS REALLY WATCHING. - HE HAD TO BE SOME KIND OF -- - MILITARY OR SOME KIND OF -- BECAUSE HE HAD SO MANY SKILLS THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE. HE WAS PATIENT. I JUST FEEL SO SAD FOR ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO'VE LOST AND WERE RAPED AND LOST, BECAUSE OF THIS ONE MAN. I HOPE MORE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT, SO IT GETS OUT AND SO WE CAN FIND AND PUT A CLOSURE TO IT. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS AREA THAT GOT ABUSED BY HIM, OR KILLED. THE FORMULATED ATTACKS, PHYSICAL AGILITY, AND A FAMILIARITY WITH FIREARMS COULD POINT TO ANOTHER AFFILIATION, THE MILITARY. 5 OF THE FIRST 16 ATTACKS OCCURRED IN THIS CORDOVA MEADOWS NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS RIGHT ACROSS THE FREEWAY FROM MATHER AIR FORCE BASE. AND THE FIFTH ATTACK, HE ATTACKS JANE CARSON, AND HER HUSBAND WAS A CAPTAIN IN THE AIR FORCE. SOME OF THE CASES, HE'S WEARING WHAT'S DESCRIBED AS MILITARY-STYLE BOOTS OR JUNGLE BOOTS. HE ATTACKED SO MANY TIMES AND SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO SLIP AWAY, EVEN THOUGH SACRAMENTO HAD SO MANY LAW-ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES OUT THERE TO TRY TO CATCH HIM. CITIZEN SLEUTHS HOPE THAT THE BADGE THEY'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING COULD PROVIDE SOME ANSWERS. WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OTHER BADGES ONLINE, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE ORIGIN OF THE BADGE AND WHAT THE SIGNIFICANCE MIGHT BE. NOW, IN LOOKING THROUGH SEVERAL CALIFORNIA BADGES, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THEM DO HAVE THAT SEVEN-POINT STAR, BUT I'M NOT FINDING ANYTHING EXACTLY LIKE THIS ONE. MEANWHILE, KEITH KOMOS IS HOPING FOR A RETURN CALL FROM A CALIFORNIA HISTORIAN. THIS GUY HAS WRITTEN TWO DIFFERENT BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT. HE KNOWS EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT CALIFORNIA BADGES. WHILE HE WAITS, HE CHECKS A FEW MORE ONLINE SOURCES. MY FIRST STOP IS TO THE SAN JOSE POLICE DEPARTMENT WEBSITE, WHERE THEY HAVE A GREAT HISTORICAL RUNDOWN OF THE DIFFERENT BADGES TO DIFFERENT LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT HISTORY. I'M NOT COMING UP WITH MUCH, WHICH IS DISAPPOINTING, BECAUSE I WAS HOPING THERE WAS A CONNECTION THERE, BUT THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE. MIKE AND KEITH'S SEARCHES ARE BOTH COMING UP EMPTY. THAT IS, UNTIL THEY GET A CALL BACK. WELL, I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH THE BADGE EXPERT. HE'S THE FOREMOST AUTHORITY ON THESE POLICE BADGES, ESPECIALLY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HE KNEW IMMEDIATELY WHAT THIS BADGE WAS. MIKE MORFORD AND KEITH KOMOS ARE INVESTIGATING A BADGE THAT THEY THINK COULD CONNECT THE EAST AREA RAPIST TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THE MILITARY. AFTER TALKING TO A CALIFORNIA HISTORIAN, KEITH HAS IMPORTANT INFORMATION. HE KNEW IMMEDIATELY WHAT THIS BADGE WAS. IT'S NOT A VALUABLE BADGE AND IT'S NOT A COMMONLY USED BADGE. EVERY RESOURCE AND EVERY EXPERT IS TELLING ME THIS WAS USED, AT BEST, BY A SECURITY GUARD. IF ANYTHING, THE BADGE STEERS THE INVESTIGATION AWAY FROM THE POLICE AND MILITARY THEORIES. NO LAW-ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WOULD HAVE A BADGE LIKE THIS. IT'S ANOTHER FINDING FOR THE CASE FILES, BUT NOT A DEFINITIVE ANSWER. MEANWHILE, INVESTIGATOR PAUL HOLES HAS HIS OWN THOUGHTS ON THIS THEORY. DO I THINK OUR OFFENDER COULD'VE HAD EXPERIENCE IN THE MILITARY? I DO, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT GENERATION. THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS PROBABLY GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL IN THE LATE '60s TO THE EARLY '70s. WELL, WHAT WAS GOING ON? WE HAD THE VIETNAM WAR GOING ON, AND MALES OF THAT AGE WERE BEING DRAFTED. SO, MOST OF THE SUSPECTS THAT I HAVE LOOKED AT WERE EITHER IN THE MILITARY, BECAUSE THEY WERE DRAFTED OR THEY WENT INTO THE NATIONAL GUARD. THEY FULFILLED THEIR MILITARY OBLIGATION. MEN OF THAT AGE HAD TO DO THAT. BUT THE LAW-ENFORCEMENT SIDE, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING THAT INDICATES THAT THIS GUY HAS ANYTHING BEYOND WHAT SOMEBODY WHO IS INTELLIGENT WOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT AND LEARN THOSE SKILLS DURING THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIMES AND DOES NOT REQUIRE SOMEBODY TO HAVE BEEN IN THE MILITARY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ORDER TO DO THAT. WHILE THE EAST AREA RAPIST MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HIDING WITHIN THE RANKS OF THE ARMED FORCES, HE WAS KNOWN TO USE MANY PLOYS TO OBSCURE HIS TRUE IDENTITY. THERE ARE VERBAL AND BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS THAT HE'S STAGING DURING THESE ATTACKS. HE'S TELLING THE VICTIMS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO TELL LAW ENFORCEMENT. "DON'T TELL THE PIG YOU SAW MY VAN PARKED OUTSIDE." HE MAKES STATEMENTS ABOUT HAVING A VAN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE SERIES. I CAN GUARANTEE, HE NEVER DROVE A VAN, BUT HE'S TRYING TO LEAD LAW ENFORCEMENT TO LOOK FOR A VAN VERSUS WHATEVER VEHICLE HE ACTUALLY WAS DRIVING. THE RAPIST IS KEENLY AWARE OF HOW HE PRESENTS TO THE PUBLIC. HE TRIES TO PAINT A MISLEADING PORTRAIT, BUT SOMETIMES HIS ACTIONS ARE PURELY EGO-DRIVEN. THERE IS A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE IN "THE SACRAMENTO BEE" THAT STATED, "THIS GUY HAS NEVER ATTACKED WHEN THERE'S A MAN HOME." THE VERY NEXT ATTACK, IS THERE'S A MAN HOME. SO, THE THOUGHT IS, IS THAT HE READ THAT NEWSPAPER ARTICLE AND WAS LIKE, "OKAY, I CAN DO THAT." FROM THAT POINT ON, IN ROUGHLY TWO-THIRDS OF THE ATTACKS, THERE'S A MAN PRESENT. IT WAS VERY SADISTIC. THE MALE VICTIMS WERE TIED UP, LAYING ON THEIR STOMACH WITH THEIR HANDS TIED BEHIND THEIR BACK AND THEIR FEET TIED. AND THEN HE WOULD PUT DISHES ON THEIR BACK TO MAKE SURE THAT IF HE WAS IN THE OTHER ROOM DOING THE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THEY MOVED, HE WOULD HEAR THE DISHES. HE TOLD THEM, "IF I HEAR THE DISHES RATTLE, I WILL COME IN AND I WILL KILL YOU, I WILL KILL YOUR WIFE." WHILE THE MALE LAID THERE, KNOWING THAT HIS WIFE OR GIRLFRIEND WAS BEING ATTACKED, WAS A HORRIFIC EMOTIONAL THING FOR EVERYBODY TO DEAL WITH. SOMETIMES YOU HAD CHILDREN WHO WERE IN THE HOME WHO SAW THE RAPIST. YOU HAD THE FEMALE WHO WAS ASSAULTED AND YOU HAD THE MALE WHO COULD DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT IT. IT WAS SOMETIMES A WHOLE HOUSEHOLD WHO HAD BEEN TRAUMATIZED AND TERRORIZED. THAT NEWSPAPER ARTICLE, IN ESSENCE, INDIRECTLY CHALLENGED HIM. AND I THINK HE FELT THAT THAT WAS A SLIGHT AGAINST HIM AND HIS MALENESS. "HE NEVER ATTACKS WHEN THERE'S A MAN PRESENT." "WELL, YEAH, I CAN DO THAT AND I WILL SHOW 'EM I'M CAPABLE OF DOING THAT." WITH EACH ATTACK, THE EAST AREA RAPIST SEEMS TO BE GAINING CONFIDENCE AND FUELING HIS DESIRE TO TERRORIZE AS MANY PEOPLE AS HE POSSIBLY CAN. AND IN APRIL OF 1977, HE'S ONLY JUST GETTING STARTED. IN LESS THAN A YEAR, SACRAMENTO'S EAST AREA RAPIST STRIKES OVER 20 TIMES AND AFTER THE BRUTAL ATTACK ON A COUPLE IN APRIL OF 1977, HE'S SHOWN HIS CAPACITY FOR A NEW LEVEL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TERROR. THERE WAS REALLY NOT ANY NORMAL ANYMORE, BECAUSE SACRAMENTO WAS IN A STATE OF FEAR. YOU PLAN ON TAKING ANY PRECAUTIONS? I PUT LOCKS ON MY DOORS, PEEPHOLES IN JUST LAST WEEK, YEAH. I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE A GUN, BUT I STILL DON'T FEEL SAFE BEING, YOU KNOW, AT HOME ALONE. I IMAGINE A LOT OF WOMEN IN THE AREA ARE SCARED AND ARE NERVOUS. IF THEY COULD JUST KIND OF GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER'S HABITS, THEIR NEIGHBOR'S HABITS, AND CALL IN IF THEY SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS AT ALL. MY HUSBAND AND MY SON AND I WOULD SLEEP TOGETHER IN OUR KING-SIZE BED AT NIGHT. IT SEEMED LIKE EVERY OTHER DAY, THERE WAS A NEW REPORT OF A RAPE IN THE NEWSPAPER. BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS BUYING GUNS, OUR BURGLARY RATE WENT WAY DOWN. THERE WASN'T A BURGLAR THAT WANTED TO ENTER A HOME WITH ANYBODY IN IT, UM, FOR FEAR OF BEING SHOT. IF THERE IS AN INTRUDER... AND THERE WERE SO MANY RUMORS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THE SHERIFF DECIDED THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SOME PUBLIC MEETINGS. WE JUST NEEDED TO TRY TO CALM THE COMMUNITY IN ANY WAY THAT WE COULD. IF YOU ARE GOING TO DEFEND YOURSELF, YOU MUST INJURE YOUR ATTACKER AND I DON'T MEAN JUST HURT HIM, BECAUSE BY HURTING HIM, YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO MAKE HIM MADDER. BUT YOU INJURE HIM ENOUGH TO INCAPACITATE HIM IN ANY WAY THAT YOU CAN. AT ONE COMMUNITY MEETING, A GENTLEMAN STOOD UP AND SAID, HE ABSOLUTELY COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT AN ASSAULT COULD OCCUR WITH TWO PEOPLE OR MORE IN THE HOUSE AND NOBODY BEING ABLE TO PREVENT IT. SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, HE AND HIS WIFE WERE VICTIMS OF THE EAST AREA RAPIST, PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST ASSAULTS OF THE WHOLE SERIES. I KNOW OUR OFFENDER'S A VERY VINDICTIVE PERSON. SO, WHEN THIS MAN STANDS UP AND STARTS MAKING STATEMENTS, AT THAT POINT, THIS GUY SAYS, "I WILL SHOW YOU." WE HAD A LOT OF OFFICERS IN PLAINCLOTHES THERE. WE HAD OFFICERS OUTSIDE WATCHING PEOPLE. HOW HE GOT TO THE MEETING, WHERE HE WAS SITTING, WE HAVE NO IDEA. BUT, YES, I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT HE WAS AT THAT MEETING, AND I THINK HE FOLLOWED THEM HOME. THE ATTACK AFTER THE COMMUNITY MEETING BRINGS TO LIGHT A TERRIFYING REALIZATION, THE PERP IS HIDING AMONGST THEM IN PLAIN SIGHT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE THESE ATTACKS ARE OCCURRING, YOU ARE SEEING THAT THIS IS AN OFFENDER THAT IS VERY COMFORTABLE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS AND IS OFTEN ATTACKING IN MIDDLE- TO UPPER-CLASS LOCATIONS. THIS TELLS ME THIS GUY IS PROBABLY OUT OF THAT TYPE OF DEMOGRAPHIC HIMSELF. EITHER HE GREW UP IN THAT TYPE OF NEIGHBORHOOD OR AS AN ADULT, THAT'S THE TYPE OF NEIGHBORHOOD HE LIVES IN. HIS CAR FITS IN TO THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. HIS CLOTHING FITS IN TO THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. SO, PEOPLE IN THESE TYPES OF NEIGHBORHOODS DON'T SEE THIS GUY. HE JUST KIND OF COMES AND GOES, BECAUSE HE BLENDS IN, HE LOOKS JUST LIKE THEM. LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO, FOR YEARS, HAVE LIVED NEXT DOOR TO A NEIGHBOR AND THEN THEY'RE ARRESTED FOR AN OLD MURDER AND YET, THEY'VE BEEN AN OUTSTANDING CITIZEN, THEY'VE MARRIED, AND THEY'VE HAD A FAMILY. I HAVE BELIEVED ALL ALONG THAT SOMEBODY KNEW WHO THE RAPIST WAS, WHETHER IT WAS A MOTHER, A GIRLFRIEND, A CLOSE FRIEND. WE HAD SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT HIM, ABOUT HIS CLOTHING. WE KNEW HE WORE A SIZE 9 SHOE. AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS TAKING TRINKETS FROM ALL OF THE RAPES, PICTURES, DRIVER'S LICENSE, JEWELRY, THAT HE WOULD HAVE IN HIS POSSESSION. I JUST FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY KNEW AND THAT PERSON EITHER IS DECEASED OR JUST HAS CHOSEN NOT TO COME FORWARD. FOR 40 YEARS, HE'S PLAYED A GAME WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HAS WON. AND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BOLSTER HIS CONFIDENCE THAT HE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO WIN. I DO THINK THAT IF HE IS STILL ALIVE, THAT HE IS FOLLOWING WHAT'S ONLINE AND WHAT'S IN THE MEDIA AND IS RECOGNIZING THAT MAYBE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GOING TO CATCH UP WITH HIM. Hello? Going to kill you. Going to kill you. NEXT TIME ON "THE GOLDEN IT'S NOT OVER"... HE CAME UP TO ME AND PRESSED VERY HARD AND SAID, "YOU WANT ME TO CUT OFF YOUR EAR?" HE WAS BECOMING MORE VICIOUS IN HIS ASSAULTS, AND WE REALLY FELT THAT HE WAS TRYING TO WORK UP TO MURDER. THE MATTRESS THAT JANELLE WAS KILLED ON WAS RIGHT HERE ON THE FRONT LAWN AND THERE WAS SO MUCH BLOOD. TWO OF THE PIECES LOOKED LIKE ESSAYS, AND THEN THERE WAS A HAND-DRAWN DIAGRAM. THIS PERSON HAS SOME UNDERSTANDING ON HOW TO LAY OUT A FAIRLY COMPLEX PROJECT. - YES. - IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME. WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THIS CASE AND CATCH THIS GUY.
