   You?were?sippin'?suds with?your?buds the?other?day... Hey,?Dary, real?quick. "Blank,?lunch?and?dinner." Breh-fekst. Oh,?boy. Can?I?be?honest?with?you?guys for?a?sec? Oh,?careful,?Dary. I'd?suggest everything?you've?said up?until?now has?been?a?lie. And?you've?said lots?of?things. Like,?when?someone starts?a?sentence with?"Don't?take?this the?wrong?way..." Guess?what? I?already?did. Yeah,?the?same?thing if?people?start?a?sentence by?saying,?"You're?gonna hate?me?for?saying?this..." Guess?what??I?already?do. Or,?when?people?start?a?sentence by?saying, "You're?not?gonna wanna?hear?this..." Guess?what? I?already?don't. No,?it's?just an?observation. Well?I'm?curious?as?to?know why?you?thought it?required?a?preface. Well,?because?I'm?aware of?how?it?might?sound. Quit?beatin' around?the?bush,?Dary. Yeah,?Dary,?I?don't?remember you?been?such?an ??around-the-bush?beater. Oh,?fine,?now I'm?not?even?gonna?say?it. Say?it. The?only?thing worse?than?saying, "You're?not?gonna wanna?hear?this," is?when?someone?says they?have?something?to?say, and?they?don't?say?it. You're?digging ?your?heels?in?like a?12-year-old?girl. When?in?doubt,?spit's?it?out. Okay,?fine, ??I'm?gonna?say?it. Okay,?here?goes. You?know?micro-brewing? Like,?craft?beer? Yeah. I?always?thought it?was?"craft?beard," on?account?of?the?guys who?make?it?always?have?beards. So,?it?was?all?that for?just?this?then,?eh? Thank?you?for?inviting?us into?the?circle?of?trust,?Dary. I?believe?the preferred?term?is, "lumbersexuals." Well,?"craft?beard"?makes a?pocket-load?more?sense. You?know,?craft?beards doesn't?really?bother?me. But?it's?the?clever?wordplay that?goes?into ?the?naming?of?it that?I?finds?hard?to?swallow. Like,?"So?hoppy?together," or?"Barley?breathing." Now,?why?don't?you just?call?them?what?it?is? It's?fuckin'?beer. "Beer?and?headlights." Yeah. ?I'll?contribute. "Ale?by?comparison." Stout?and?about. Sounds?actually?pretty?good, "Stout?and?about." Stout?and?about's not?bad?at?all,?actually. I'd?drink?some stout?and?about. I'm?surprised we're?not?drinking?a stout?and?about?right?now. I?think?what?you?wanna?do?is you?wanna?put an?animal?in?the?name 'cause?people?love?animals. Like,?"Cute?Koala?Cream," or?"Happy?Hamster?Honey." No,?no. ?What?you?wanna?do?is you?wanna?put a?berry?in?the?name 'cause?people?love?berries. "Partridge?Berry?Pilsner," or?"Alderberry?Ale." Pleasing?to?the?ears and?the?mouth. No,?Dary. Dary,?no. No,?Dan. ?Dan,?no. No,?Katy. ?Katy,?no. What?you're?exposed?to?do, is?put?something cozy?in?the?names 'cuz?people?like being?cozy,?right? Like?"toque"?or?"mittens." And?then,?if?you?really?wanna double?down?on?it, you?put?something outdoorsy?in?the?name because?people?love being?outdoors. Like,?"lake," or?"mountains." So?what?it's?really gonna?boil?down?to is?"Toque?Lake?Brew?co," or?"Mountain?Mittens Alpine?Ale." "Blanket?Fire?Light." There?you?go,?Dary. The?other?ways to?go?is?to?use a?clever, but?ironical?statement. Like,?"I'm?bitters." See,?I'd?go?suggestive. Like,?"Slip-it-in?cider." Katy. What? Let's?get?this?gal a?fuckin'?puppers.
