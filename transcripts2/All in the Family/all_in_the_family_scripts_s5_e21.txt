 All in the Family (1971–1979): Season 5, Episode 21 - Archie and the Quiz - full transcript 
 Out of curiosity, Archie takes a magazine test about his health habits. When he scores the test, he learns he might die at age 57. Rather than take the test for what it is worth (or heed the advice of the accompanying article), Archie fumes about his apparent fate.

 BUT I WAS THE FAST PEDDLER AND ARCHIE WAS THE SLOW PEDDLER. SO OUR LEGS DIDN'T CATCH UP WITH EACH OTHER UNTIL YOUR FATHER'S PANTS CAUGHT IN THE CHAIN. THEN WE FELL OFF. OH, THAT HURTS. OH, YEAH. AND THEN ARCHIE FIGURED OUT THAT ON THE WAY BACK ONE OF US SHOULD RIDE AND ONE OF US SHOULD WALK. HOW FAR'D YOU HAVE TO WALK, MA? OH, ONLY 3 MILES. HERE, MA, LET ME HELP YOU WITH THE CROSSWORD. OH, THIS AIN'T A CROSSWORD. IT'S A LIFE EXPECTANCY TEST. I FOUND IT IN THIS OLD HARPER'S MAGAZINE IRENE WAS THROWIN' OUT. YOU ANSWER ALL THESE QUESTIONS AND THEN IT TELLS YOU HOW LONG YOU'RE GONNA LIVE. WELL, LET ME SEE. HOW'D YOU DO? 846? MA, THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT. OH, NO, IT AIN'T. YOU GOTTA PUT A DOT HERE AFTER THE 4. THERE. OH, THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONNA LIVE TO BE 84? AND 6 MONTHS. LIVING WITH ARCHIE, IT'LL SEEM A LOT LONGER. HERE I AM AND WE HAD A TERRIFIC MEETING TONIGHT AT THE LODGE, EDITH. ARCHIE, GUESS HOW LONG I'M GONNA LIVE. LOOK AT THIS. I'M ONLY HOME A MINUTE AND SHE'S THREATENIN' ME. GET THE DINNER ON THE TABLE, EDITH. OH, YEAH, WELL, IT'LL BE A LITTLE WHILE, ARCHIE, 'CAUSE THE POTATOES ARE RUNNIN' BEHIND THE CHICKEN. WHILE... WHILE WE'RE WAITING, LET ME FIGURE OUT HOW LONG YOU'RE GONNA LIVE. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA TELL ME HOW LONG YOU'RE GONNA LIVE. 84 YEARS AND 6 MONTHS. OOH, WHOOP-DEE-DOO! YEAH, IT'S ALL IN THIS QUIZ HERE. YEAH, WELL, I'M GONNA BE RIGHT WITH YOU THERE, EDITH, BECAUSE A GYPSY PALM-READER IN CONEY ISLAND ONCE TOLD ME I GOT THE LONGEST LIFELINE SHE EVER SEEN, SEE? STARTS RIGHT THERE, WRAPS AROUND THE THUMB TWICE, AND GOES UP HERE UNDERNEATH THE WATCHBAND. SEE THAT? I'LL PROBABLY LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THEM PUT A MAN ON MARS. WHAT IF THEY DO THAT NEXT YEAR? WHAT I WON'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO SEE IS A MEATHEAD ON A PAYROLL. DID YOU HAVE FUN AT THE LODGE MEETING? WE HAD A MILLION LAUGHS. YOU REMEMBER SKEETS CALLAHAN THAT RETIRED FROM WINDOW WASHING? MMM, YEAH. WELL, HE HAD HIS LITTLE GRANDSON THERE WITH HIM, LITTLE SKEETS III. KID WAS DRESSED UP IN A COMBAT INFANTRYMAN'S OUTFIT, YOU KNOW. CUTEST THING YOU EVER SEEN WITH GRENADES AND A MACHINE GUN AND EVERYTHING. I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE TO SEE CHILDREN PLAYING WAR. AW. [razzing] LEARNING HOW TO FIGHT, THAT'S THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD THERE, LITTLE GIRL. HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT? WELL, BECAUSE OF THE WAY GOD MADE MEN. I MEAN, LOOK AT THEM. WHAT, HE GIVE THEM A TRIGGER FINGER, DIDN'T HE? ARCH, IF GOD HAD MEANT MAN TO FIGHT, WHY DIDN'T HE PUT GUNS IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN? WHO THE HELL IS ADAM GONNA SHOOT? EVE? WHY'S HE GONNA DO THAT ANYWAY? 'CAUSE SHE'S GOTTA HELP HIM POPULATE THE WORLD, AND MAKE HIS BREAKFAST FOR HIM. AND WHEN THE WORLD GETS POPULATION ENOUGH, YOU GOT ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TO MAKE ARMIES, THEN GOD SENT DOWN THE WORD THAT THEY COULD INVENT THE GUN. AND I THINK THAT, UH, GERMAN PREACHER, MARTIN LUGER, MADE THE FIRST ONE. YOU KNOW, YOU OUGHT TO TEACH A BIBLE CLASS. THEY GOT THOSE KIDS BELIEVIN' THAT GOD STANDS FOR PEACE AND LOVE. WHICH HE DOES, EXCEPT IN TIME OF WAR. SO, WHAT'D YOU COME UP WITH THERE, EDITH? I'D BETTER SEE IF THE POTATOES CAUGHT UP WITH THE CHICKEN. YEAH, I... I... I HOPE YOU LAID IN A COUPLE OF 6 PACKS OF BEER 'CAUSE I GOT A HELL OF A THIRST ON ME. I WAS THINKIN' ABOUT THAT ALL THROUGH THE LODGE MEETING. OH! YOU DONE IT. HERE IT IS, FIRST TODAY. SO WHAT AGE DID YOU COME UP FOR ME, HUH? THE POTATOES LOOK FINE. WHAT'D YOU GET? 90, 85, 80... OH, WELL, THOSE TESTS DON'T MEAN NOTHIN', ARCHIE. THEY'RE JUST FOR FUN. I KNOW THEY'RE JUST FOR FUN. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO FIND OUT, HOW MANY YEARS OF FUN I GOT LEFT. HEY, HEY, WHAT DID YOU GET? WELL, IF I TELL YOU, WILL YOU PROMISE NOT TO TAKE IT SERIOUS? OH, WHO TAKES THEM THINGS SERIOUSLY? WHAT IS IT? 63 YEARS AND 4 MONTHS. HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT? THAT MAGAZINE BUMPED YOU OFF BEFORE YOU GET SOCIAL SECURITY. ARCHIE, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BELIEVE WHAT A QUIZ IN A MAGAZINE TELLS YOU. I DON'T BELIEVE IT, EDITH. OH, WELL, I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD. NO. LISTEN, HERE'S SOMETHING I NEVER TOLD YOU. THE GYPSY PALM-READER THERE, WELL, SHE TOLD ME THAT I'M GONNA OUTLIVE YOU BY 10 YEARS. SO CHEER UP. W... I COULD'VE MADE A MISTAKE IN ADDING. WELL, YOU ALWAYS DO, EDITH. THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA CHECK YOUR FIGURES HERE. I DON'T WANNA LEAVE MY LIFE IN THE HANDS OF A DINGBAT. NO! UH, UH, GLORIA, WOULD YOU HELP ME GET THE DINNER ON? YEAH, GET UP AND HELP YOUR MOTHER, HUH? YEAH, MAYBE THE POTATOES PASSED THE CHICKEN. DAMN THING KILLED ME OFF AT 63. WHAT KIND OF A TEST IS THIS, HUH? HOW DOES IT WORK HERE, MEATHEAD? WELL, LET'S TAKE A LOOK. UH, LET'S SEE, UH, WELL, IT SAYS HERE, YOU TAKE YOUR YEAR OF BIRTH. WHAT WAS THAT, 1924? YEAH. YEAH, ALL RIGHT, WELL, THAT WOULD MAKE YOUR BASE FIGURE 580. WHERE'D YOU GET THAT? RIGHT OVER THERE, SEE? OH, YEAH. YEAH. THEN, UH, FOR YOUR PRESENT AGE, WHICH IS WHAT, 51? YEAH. YEAH. WELL, YOU ADD, UH, 5 YEARS, SO THAT STARTS YOU OUT WITH, UH, 630. WAIT A MINUTE, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG RIGHT AWAY. WHAT? THAT ADDS UP. I MEAN, LOOK WHERE YOU'RE SITTIN'. ALL RIGHT, START OFF WITH 630. ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS THING. ALL RIGHT. IT SAYS, "IF YOU'RE MARRIED, ADD 5 YEARS." THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. ONE OF THEM ARABS WITH 20 WIVES PICKS UP 100 YEARS FOR OPENERS. I'M MARRIED. THEY GIVE ME 5 YEARS FOR HAVIN' EDITH. I THOUGHT THEY'D DOCK ME FOR THAT. UH-OH, UH-OH, HERE'S WHERE YOU LOSE A FEW. YEAH? WHERE? HERE, RIGHT THERE, WHERE YOU LIVE. "SMALL TOWN, ADD 3 1/2 YEARS, BIG CITY, SUBTRACT 2 YEARS." OH, COME ON. WHY SHOULD A CITY GUY LOSE OUT 2 YEARS? 'CAUSE THERE'S MORE POLLUTION, MORE CONGESTION, MORE DISEASE. ALL RIGHT, BUT THERE'S MORE HOSPITALS, TOO, AIN'T THERE? AND MORE CEMETERIES. AW, COME ON. I AIN'T GONNA GIVE MYSELF NOTHIN' BUT I AIN'T TAKIN' OFF NOTHIN', EITHER. IT'S A STUPID QUESTION. HOW YOU DOIN', DADDY? DID YOU FIND OUT IF I ADDED WRONG? ALL RIGHT, EDITH, W-W-WE'RE GETTIN' THERE. NOW LET ME SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE. WHERE ARE YOU, WHERE ARE YOU? "ALCOHOL, HEAVY DRINKERS, SUBTRACT 5 YEARS. VERY HEAVY DRINKERS, SUBTRACT 10 YEARS." ALL RIGHT, WELL, I DON'T DRINK. YOU DRINK BEER. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? BEER IS HEALTHY. GIVE ME A COUPLE OF YEARS THERE. BEER IS HEALTHY? WELL, CERTAINLY IT IS, LITTLE GIRL. YOUR BEER IS MADE FROM YOUR BARLEY, YOUR BARLEY IS FED TO YOUR HORSES. EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW LONG HORSES LIVE. 20 YEARS. SHUT UP. I THINK YOU BETTER LEAVE THAT ONE BLANK LIKE I DID. NO, THAT AIN'T RIGHT. LOOK HERE, THEY KNOCK OFF 2 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE FOR BEING A CITY GUY. WHY DON'T THEY GIVE YOU SOMETHIN' FOR NOT BEIN' A LUSH? YEAH, BUT ARCHIE, YOU'RE STILL AHEAD. 'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T SUBTRACT THEN IT'S THE SAME AS ADDIN' 'CAUSE WHAT YOU DON'T TAKE OFF, YOU PUT ON. THAT'S THE KIND OF THINKIN' THAT KNOCKED ME OFF AT 63. JUST GET THE DINNER ON, WILL YOU? I'M FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE HERE. ALL RIGHT, WHAT HAVE WE GOT NEXT HERE? YEAH. "ECONOMIC STATUS. DEDUCT 3 YEARS IF WEALTHY OR POOR." WEALTHY OR POOR? WHAT THE HELL ELSE IS THERE? MIDDLE CLASS, WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE. WELL, ACTUALLY WE'RE LOWER-MIDDLE CLASS. WELL, AS I REMEMBER IT, WE WAS UPPER TILL YOU JOINED THE FAMILY. YOU LOSE AT LEAST 2 YEARS THERE. ALL RIGHT, NOW, "SMOKING. "ONE HALF TO ONE PACK OF CIGARETTES A DAY, SUBTRACT 3 YEARS. PIPE OR CIGAR, SUBTRACT 2 YEARS." LOOK AT THAT, 2 YEARS. AH, YOU SMOKE CIGARS, THAT'S MINUS 2. BUT WAIT A MINUTE, I DON'T SMOKE CIGARETTES, SO I SHOULD GET A PLUS 3. SO, PLUS 3 TO MINUS 2, SO IPSO FATSO, PLUS ONE. GIVE ME THAT. YOU GET MINUS 2. "IPSO FATSO." IF YOU KEEP MINUSIN' I'LL BE DEAD IN 1965. HERE. "YOUR SHAPE." HMM, LOOK AT THIS. "IF YOU'RE OVER 40, DEDUCT ONE YEAR FOR EVERY 5 POUNDS YOU ARE OVERWEIGHT." THAT'S WHERE I LOST YOU. COME ON, WILL YOU? IT AIN'T SO MUCH THAT, I GOT HEAVY BONES. IN YOUR STOMACH? COME ON, YOU GOTTA DEDUCT AT LEAST 2 YEARS FOR THAT. AW, THIS THING IS CRAZY. HERE, LOOK AT THIS. "EVERY INCH OF YOUR WAIST MEASUREMENT..." JEEZ, I WISH THEY'D GET OFF OF THE BELLY. "EVERY INCH YOUR WAIST MEASUREMENT "EXCEEDS YOUR CHEST MEASUREMENT, DEDUCT 2 YEARS." OH, I GOT ABOUT A 40 CHEST AND ABOUT A 38 WAIST. DADDY, HOW LONG CAN YOU HOLD YOUR BREATH LIKE THAT? TILL THE TEST IS OVER. ARCH, ONCE YOU EXHALE YOUR WAIST IS 41. YOU LOSE A YEAR. OH, COME ON. DID YOU COME TO DISPOSITION YET? I HAD TO DEDUCT 4 YEARS FOR THAT. 4 YEARS? WHY'D YOU DO A DUMB THING LIKE THAT? BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU LOSE YOUR TEMPER. I DO, LIKE HELL! COME ON, GIVE ME PLUS 4 THERE. MINUS, DADDY. IF YOU DON'T LET ME WIN A FEW, YOU'RE GONNA BE MINUS DADDY.

"THEY WILL PREDICT FOR ANY OF US ONLY IN TERMS OF VERY ROUGH ODDS." ARCH, YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE WHEN YOU'RE 57. THE ONLY REAL INDICATION OF HOW LONG A PERSON'S GONNA LIVE I-IS HIS HEREDITY. BUT I AIN'T GOT THAT. I LOST THAT WITH MY APPENDIX, DIDN'T I? ARCH, ARCH, YOUR... YOUR HEREDITY IS... IS YOUR FAMILY HISTORY. WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU TALK CLEAR? ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

I ALREADY GAVE 2 YEARS OF MY LIFE FOR THIS. [exclaiming] MAYBE IF YOU GIVE UP SMOKIN' YOU'LL GET 'EM BACK. AND THEN IF YOU LOSE WEIGHT YOU'LL GET A FEW MORE YEARS. OH, NO, NO, IT'S TOO LATE, EDITH. MY BUS HAS SAILED. ARCH, MA'S RIGHT. I MEAN, I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT SILLY TEST BUT I MEAN, IF YOU DID CHANGE YOUR LIFESTYLE, MAYBE YOU COULD ADD A FEW YEARS.
