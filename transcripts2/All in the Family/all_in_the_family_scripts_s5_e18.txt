 All in the Family (1971–1979): Season 5, Episode 18 - All's Fair - full transcript 
 Mike and Gloria have been going to a class that teaches them how to fight constructively, and their new-found knowledge opens their eyes as to what a doormat Edith is to Archie. They convince her that she has to stand up to Archie and bring their arguments to an equal balance. Edith is reluctant at first but when Archie comes home, everyone is shocked by how stubborn Edith can be when she puts her foot down. She and Archie get into a serious argument, the lynch-pin of which is the upcoming visit by her cousin whom Archie can't stand. Archie says no, but Edith sticks to her guns and refuses to back down. She ends up sleeping on the couch as a result and a confused and shell-shocked Archie tries to make amends. When the subject of Edith's cousin comes up again Archie begins the argument over again and still Edith won't back down.

 OH. YEAH, BUT LOOK WHAT YOU DID. YOU GOT A KNIFE HERE, 2 FORKS AND A SPOON AND... AND HERE YOU GOT A SPOON, 2 FORKS AND A KNIFE. AND THERE YOU GOT 2 SPOONS AND 2 KNIVES, AND OVER THERE YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. THAT AIN'T RIGHT, IS IT? OK, MA, WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? ARCHIE. THAT'LL DO IT. HE'S HAVIN' A FIT. HE SAYS HE DON'T WANT MY COUSIN ESTELLE AND RALPH COMIN' TO VISIT US NEXT WEEK, AND I ALREADY ASKED THEM. WELL, HOW CAN HE SAY THAT? AND WHEN YOU AND HE WENT TO PHILADELPHIA TO VISIT THEM, THEY SHOWED YOU A REALLY GREAT TIME. WELL, HE SAYS THAT IT'S EASY FOR THEM TO BE NICE TO HIM 'CAUSE THEY LIKE HIM. BUT IT'S HARD FOR HIM TO BE NICE TO THEM. MA, MA, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF YOU'VE ALREADY INVITED 'EM? OH, I WROTE 'EM A LETTER. I SAID THE FURNACE WAS BROKE DOWN, AND THE PLUMBIN' DIDN'T WORK, AND THE HOUSE WAS BEIN' PAINTED. MA, HOW COULD YOU LIE LIKE THAT? ARCHIE TOLD ME TO. BUT I TORE THE LETTER UP, CAUSE' AS SOON AS I READ IT I COULD SEE RIGHT THROUGH ME. OH, I'M GLAD YOU DID, MA. YOU KNOW, IT ISN'T FAIR. ESTELLE IS YOUR FAVORITE COUSIN AND IF YOU WANT 'EM HERE, YOU SHOULD HAVE AN EQUAL SAY ABOUT IT. WE DID. I SAID THEY COULD COME AND ARCHIE SAID THEY COULDN'T. THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER SAY AND TELL HIM ESTELLE AND RALPH ARE COMING, PERIOD. OH, I CAN'T DO THAT, GLORIA. 'CAUSE ARCHIE ALREADY SAID CASE CLOSED. BUT, MA, WHAT KIND OF... MA. WHAT KIND OF A MARRIAGE IS IT WHEN ONE PARTNER IS ALWAYS GIVIN' THE ORDERS AND THE OTHER ONE ALWAYS HAS TO OBEY? WELL, THE WORD "OBEY" WAS IN OUR MARRIAGE CEREMONY. WELL, YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN THE WORD "OBEY" OUT. MMM-HMM. THE MINISTER ASKED US IF WE WANTED IT IN, AND ARCHIE SAID, " YES, AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE." WELL, I DON'T ALWAYS GIVE IN TO ARCHIE. OH, NO? HEH. GLORIA, OUR MARRIAGE MAY NOT BE PERFECT, BUT IT WORKS. AND MY FATHER ALWAYS SAID, "IF SOMETHIN' WORKS, DON'T FIX IT." BUT, MA, YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP THINGS BOTTLED UP INSIDE OF YOU. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU. YOU GOTTA GET 'EM OUT. THAT'S WHAT MICHAEL AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO LATELY. LIKE, THIS MORNING, I WAS REALLY MAD AT HIM. BUT HE HAD TO GO OFF TO SCHOOL, AND I HAD TO GO TO WORK, SO WE AGREED TO PUT OFF OUR ARGUMENT UNTIL TONIGHT. YOU MEAN YOU AND MIKE MAKE APPOINTMENTS TO HAVE FIGHTS? SORT OF. IT'S WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE CALLING "FAIR FIGHTING." MICHAEL BROUGHT HOME A BOOK ON IT. YOU KNOW, YOU AND DADDY OUGHT TO TRY THAT. FAIR FIGHTIN'? YEAH, THEY'RE TELLIN' PEOPLE TO GET THINGS OUT IN THE OPEN. YOU KNOW, LET OFF STEAM, MA. 'CAUSE WHEN YOU HOLD THINGS THING INSIDE AND YOU BOTTLE 'EM UP, IT'S CALLED GUNNYSACKING. AND THAT'S NOT HEALTHY. SOME COUPLES ARE EVEN TAKIN' LESSONS IN FIGHTING. OH, I DON'T THINK ARCHIE NEEDS LESSONS. (Mike) I'M HOME. AH, HE'S HERE. HI, HONEY. HOW WAS YOUR DAY? DO YOU CARE, MICHAEL? DO YOU REALLY CARE? CAN'T WAIT TO GET STARTED, CAN YOU? ALL RIGHT. WHAT DID I DO LAST NIGHT THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE, HUH? I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT A PROBLEM I HAD AT WORK, AND ONCE AGAIN YOU FELL ASLEEP ON ME. GLORIA, GLORIA, I'M ALWAYS HOME BY 6:00. WE HAVE ALL EVENING TO TALK. WHY DO YOU WAIT TILL WE GET INTO BED BEFORE YOU START TALKIN'? BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE I CAN GET YOUR ATTENTION. FUNNY, FUNNY. YOU GOT MY ATTENTION. I'M HERE. WELL, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? IT'S TOO LATE. I HAD TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM ALL BY MYSELF. NO THANKS TO YOU. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. YOU'RE ANGRY AT ME BECAUSE WHILE I WAS ASLEEP, YOU SOLVED THE PROBLEM? THAT'S DUMB, GLORIA. THAT'S JUST PLAIN DUMB. NOW DON'T CALL ME DUMB. THAT'S HITTING BELOW THE BELT. HI, MIKE. BESIDES OUR PROBLEM IS NOT THE POINT. THE POINT IS, MICHAEL, I COULD PUT A STRANGE WOMAN IN THE BED WITH YOU AND YOU'D NEVER EVEN KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. YES, I WOULD. I WOULDN'T FALL ASLEEP. YOU'RE INSENSITIVE, MICHAEL. YOU'RE AN INSENSITIVE, SELFISH MAN. WOULD YOU TWO MIND HOLDIN' UP YOUR FIGHT APPOINTMENT UNTIL AFTER DINNER? YOU KNOW, MICHAEL, THERE USED TO BE... GLORIA, GLORIA, HOLD IT. I THINK YOUR MOTHER'S GOT A POINT. I FIGHT MUCH BETTER AFTER I'VE EATEN. WELL, I DON'T. AND YOU KNOW THE RULES: ONCE WE START WE'VE GOT TO FINISH. YOU MEAN THEY GOT RULES NOW FOR FAMILY FIGHTS? WELL, YEAH, MA. THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT FAIR FIGHTING. AND ONE OF THE MAIN RULES IS NO HITTING BELOW THE BELT. OH, YOU SHOULDN'T HIT NOWHERE. NO, MA. IT JUST MEANS THAT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING THAT YOUR PARTNER IS SENSITIVE ABOUT. LIKE, I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO MENTION THE FACT THAT I'M WORKING TO SUPPORT MICHAEL. UH, CAREFUL, GLORIA. YOU KNOW, THAT I'M THE BREADWINNER AND HE'S THE FREELOADER. GLORIA. OH, MICHAEL, I'M JUST TELLING MA WHAT I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO CALL YOU. WELL, I NEVER EVEN THINK OF YOU AS A FREELOADER, HONEY. SEE, MA, WE ALL HAVE A WEAK SPOT. LIKE IN GLORIA'S CASE, IT'S HER EDUCATION. WATCH IT, MICHAEL. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BRING UP THE FACT THAT I'M A COLLEGE MAN AND SHE'S ONLY A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE. OK! I... I CAN'T SAY THINGS LIKE THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR YOU, GLORIA. THIS IS WAY OVER YOUR HEAD. YOU'RE CUTTIN' IT CLOSE, STIVIC. SO WHEN WE HAVE AN ARGUMENT, WHEN WE HAVE AN ARGUMENT, I HAVE TO USE SIMPLE WORDS SO SHE CAN UNDERSTAND. FOUL! FOUL! THAT'S HITTING WAY BELOW THE BELT! WELL, WHAT ABOUT FREELOADER, HUH? DON'T YOU THINK FREELOADER IS HITTIN' BELOW THE BELT? I DON'T THINK I LIKE THIS KIND OF FIGHTIN'. ALL RIGHT. FREELOADER WAS ROTTEN. IT WAS ROTTEN. ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY. BUT ARE YOU SORRY FOR FALLING ASLEEP ON ME LAST NIGHT WHILE I WAS TALKING TO YOU? YEAH, I'M SORRY. YEAH? YEAH. I PROMISE I... FROM NOW ON I'LL LISTEN TO EVERY WORD YOU SAY. I-I-I'LL NEVER SLEEP WHEN I'M LISTENIN' TO YOU. AS A MATTER OF FACT, IF YOU TALK IN YOUR SLEEP, I'LL WAKE UP TO LISTEN TO YOU. OK? OK. OH, I LIKE THE WAY IT ENDS UP. YOU SEE, MA? AFTER MICHAEL AND I HAVE A FAIR FIGHT, WE'RE EVEN CLOSER THAN WE USED TO BE. AND IT'D WORK THE SAME FOR YOU AND DADDY, TOO. (Mike) YEAH, YEAH, MA, YOU SEE, A MAN RESPECTS A WOMAN WHO ISN'T ALWAYS BACKIN' DOWN. I... I LOVE GLORIA MORE BECAUSE SHE STANDS UP TO ME. AND DADDY WILL FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU. YOU'LL SEE. JUST DON'T BE AFRAID TO FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU WANT. WHOOP-DEE-DOO, WHOOP-DEE-DOO. WHOOP-DEE-DOO, WAIT TILL YOU HEAR WHAT HAPPENED TO ME ON THE SUBWAY TODAY. OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL. OH, HOLD IT, HOLD IT, HOLD IT. WHAT'S WONDERFUL? WHATEVER HAPPENED. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IS WONDERFUL UNLESS I TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED? WHY COULDN'T YOU WAIT? OH, I'M SORRY. WHAT HAPPENED? I FOUND A $20 BILL. HA HA. THAT'S WONDERFUL. YEAH. AIN'T IT BETTER NOW THAT YOU'VE WAITED, HUH? YEAH. IT LOOKED DOWN ON THE SUBWAY FLOOR, EDITH, AND THERE IT WAS. AND YOU PICKED IT UP. NO, NO, I PUT MY FOOT ON IT TILL IT WAS TIME TO GET ON TO THE SUBWAY, THEN I PICKED IT UP. DIDN'T YOU ASK NOBODY IF THEY LOST IT? YOU NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS ON THE SUBWAY. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE CARRYIN' THIS KIND OF DOUGH. BUT I'M GLAD YOU'RE FEELING SO GOOD 'CAUSE I'VE GOT SOMETHIN' TO TELL YOU. GO AHEAD. REMEMBER THE LETTER THAT YOU TOLD ME TO WRITE TO MY COUSIN ESTELLE TO TELL HER NOT TO COME? YEAH, WHAT ABOUT IT? I NEVER SENT IT. EDITH, NO PROBLEM. NO PROBLEM AT ALL. TONIGHT I FEEL SO GOOD, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO? I'M GONNA GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND GET MY OWN BEER MYSELF FOR ME. ♪ WHOOP-DEE-DOO, WHOOP-DEE-DOO ♪ ♪ DOO, DOO, DOO, DOO, DOO, DOO ♪ IT WORKED. THERE'S SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE. THE GUY WHO PUTS HIS FOOT ON THE $20 BILL ON THE SUBWAY, THAT'S ARCHIE. BUT THAT NICE GUY WHO JUST WHOOP-DEE-DOOED HIMSELF INTO THE KITCHEN, THAT'S SOMEBODY ELSE. MAYBE HE DIDN'T HEAR ME. I BETTER GO TELL HIM AGAIN. NO, MA. WHY PUSH YOUR LUCK? I MEAN, THAT GOOD MOOD HE'S IN FROM FINDING THAT MONEY COULD WEAR OFF AT ANY TIME. YEAH, $20 DOESN'T GO AS FAR AS IT USED TO. I BETTER MAKE SURE. MA. ARCHIE, I THOUGHT YOU CAME IN HERE TO GET A BEER. YEAH, BUT I SEEN THIS FIRST. OH, BUT THAT'S DESSERT. YOU AIN'T HAD YOUR DINNER YET. [mumbling] ARCHIE, DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID IN THERE ABOUT COUSIN ESTELLE? YEAH, YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T SEND HER THAT LETTER. WELL, FINE. OH, I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT. 'CAUSE LETTERS CAN GET LOST IN THE MAIL. WHAT I THINK YOU OUGHT TO DO IS GET ON A TELEPHONE TO PHILLY AND TELL YOUR COUSIN FATSO AND HER HUSBAND THAT THEY CAN'T COME HERE. I WAS WRONG, THAT'S ARCHIE. WHAT DO I DO NOW? NO GUNNYSACKING. FAIR FIGHT! DO IT! ARCHIE. YEAH? I DON'T WANNA CALL PHILADELPHIA. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. JUST REVERSE THE CHARGES, FATSO CAN AFFORD IT. NO! I MEAN, I REFUSE TO CALL ESTELLE. [Mike and Gloria clapping] OH. WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON HERE? YOU... YOU... RUN 'EM WORDS PAST ME ONCE AGAIN? I AIN'T GONNA CALL ESTELLE AND I AIN'T GONNA WRITE HER, NEITHER. MY MIND IS MADE UP. CASE CLOSED. I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT CLOSES CASES AROUND HERE. NOW, DON'T BE ACTIN' LIKE A DINGBAT. OOH, FOUL. YOU JUST HIT ME BELOW THE BELT. I'M OVER HERE. I NEVER COME NEAR YOU. HOLD IT, HOLD IT, HOLD IT, HOLD IT. ARE THEM TWO PUTTIN' YOU UP TO SOME KIND OF A GAG? OH, NO, NO, ARCHIE. I JUST THINK THAT WE SHOULD TRY SOMETHIN' NEW. WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT? I'M TALKIN' ABOUT THE FAIR FIGHT WE'RE GONNA HAVE. WE AIN'T GONNA HAVE NO FIGHT. YEAH, WE ARE. NO, WE AIN'T. YES, WE ARE. NO, WE AIN'T. YES, WE ARE. WHY ARE WE GONNA FIGHT? SO WE CAN BE CLOSER THAN EVER. AND... AND STAY HAPPILY MARRIED. ARE YOU GOING THROUGH THE CHANGE AGAIN? [inaudible] MARRIAGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A 2-WAY STREET. WHAT WAS THAT? MA HAS THE RIGHT TO AIR HER FEELINGS. SHE CAN HANG HER FEELINGS ON A CLOTHESLINE FOR ALL I CARE. I DON'T WANT HER FEELINGS BRUNG TO THIS HERE TABLE. ARCHIE, I... [exclaiming] I DON'T WANNA HEAR NO MORE ABOUT FAIR FIGHTS, OR FOULS BELOW THE BELT OR GUNNY BAGGIN'S. GUNNYSACK. WHATEVER, WHATEVER. ARCHIE, GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY YOU DON'T WANT COUSIN ESTELLE VISITIN' US? I'LL GIVE YOU 4 OF THEM. SHE DYES HER HAIR, SHE NEVER SHUTS HER BIG YAP, AND SHE'S GOT A REAR END LIKE A BUS. YOU SAID 4. SHE MARRIED A CREEP. DADDY, RALPH HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST VETERINARIANS IN PHILADELPHIA. HE'S GOT FLEAS. AND I DON'T WANT FLEAS SLEEPIN' IN THIS HOUSE. AND IF HE'S SUCH A GREAT ANIMAL DOCTOR, HOW COME HIS OFFICE IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE ANIMAL CEMETERY? ARCHIE, THEY'RE INVITIN' US TO PHILADELPHIA ALL THE TIME. WELL, THEY GOT A BIG HOUSE DOWN THERE IN PHILADELPHIA. EDITH, THEY GOT A LOT OF ROOM. WE AIN'T GOT NO ROOM. THEY COME UP HERE TO STAY, WHERE THE HELL THEY GONNA SLEEP? WELL, THEY COULD USE OUR ROOM. AH, GEE, YOU WOMEN, WHERE ARE YOUS TWO GONNA SLEEP? WE'LL SLEEP DOWN HERE ON THE ROLLAWAY BED. YEAH. YOUS TWO SLEEPIN' ON WHEELS? THAT LIVIN' ROOM WILL BE LIKE THE INDIANAPOLIS SPEEDWAY. THAT WAS GROSS. I'M GLAD YOU ADMIT IT. NOW SHUT UP. MICHAEL? JUST STAY OUT OF IT. DON'T TELL HER WHAT TO DO. SHE'S MY WIFE! SHE WAS MY DAUGHTER BEFORE SHE WAS YOUR WIFE. YOU AIN'T SUPPOSED TO FIGHT WITH THEM. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FIGHT WITH ME. WHAT ARE WE FIGHTING FOR, THE WORST DINGBAT TITLE? YOU AIN'T SUPPOSED TO CALL ME NAMES NEITHER. AH. FAIR FIGHTIN', ARCHIE. THAT'S RIGHT, MA. AND YOU SHOULDN'T CALL MY COUSIN NAMES, NEITHER. I'M GETTIN' OUT OF HERE. MIKE AND GLORIA ARE NICE... WHERE ARE YOU GOIN'? DON'T YOU WANT TO HEAR MY SIDE OF THE STORY? NO, I DO NOT. AND FOR THE LAST TIME, THIS HOUSE IS OFF LIMITS TO COUSIN FATSO AND HER HUSBAND, DOGFACE. [phone ringing] I'LL GET IT. HE'S NOT GETTIN' OUT OF THIS THING SO EASY. ARCH, YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM A PROBLEM. JEEZ, YOU'RE THE BEST PROOF OF THAT. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU'RE HIDING. YOU'RE ESCAPING INTO THE SECURITY OF THE KITCHEN LIKE A CHILD TRYING TO RETURN TO THE WOMB. NO SEX WHILE I'M EATIN' HERE. WHY WON'T YOU LISTEN TO MA'S SIDE? SHE WANTS TO SAY THAT, LET HER WRITE TO DEAR ABBY, I'LL READ ABOUT IT IN THE PAPERS. YOU'RE AFRAID SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT. THAT'S IT, ARCH. YOU CAN'T ACCEPT ANYTHING NEW, LIKE FAIR FIGHTING. YOU CAN'T TAKE CHANGE. THERE'S A TECHNICAL TERM FOR GUYS LIKE YOU. THERE'S A TECHNICAL TERM FOR GUYS LIKE YOU. [sputters] THAT'S YOUR ANSWER TO EVERYTHING. TOTAL INABILITY TO FACE REALITY, SO YOU GIVE IT THE RASPBERRY. YOU GOT A POINT. [sputters] YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM THE TRUTH, ARCH. I WISH TO HELL YOU'D RUN AWAY FROM HOME. THAT CALL FOR ME? NO, IT'S COUSIN ESTELLE. OH, DON'T TELL ME PHILADELPHIA FATS IS IN TOWN. NO! SHE CALLED TO SAY THAT THEY CAN'T MAKE IT NEXT WEEK. OH, GEE, WHAT A SHAME, EDITH? TO WHAT DO WE OWE THIS, MISFORTUNATE FLUKE OF LUCK? RALPH GOT VERY BUSY. HE HAD A LOT OF SICK ANIMALS TO LOOK AFTER. OH, THAT'S WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO. STAY THERE, STAY THERE. WHEN A DOG IS THROWIN' UP, HE WANTS TO KNOW HIS OWN DOCTOR'S IN TOWN. IF ESTELLE CAN'T MAKE IT, I GUESS YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK, MA. SO FORGET IT. THAT'S RIGHT, FORGET IT. AND STOP STEAMIN' YOUR MOTHER UP OVER NOTHIN'. NOTHIN'? THAT'S RIGHT. NOTHIN'. OH, WHAT YOU THINK IS NOTHIN' MAYBE SOMETHIN' TO ME. JUST LIKE WHAT'S NOTHIN' TO ME IS SOMETHIN' TO YOU. ONLY, I WOULD NEVER SAY TO YOU YOUR NOTHIN' IS NOTHIN', BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHIN' TO YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU JUST SAID. I JUST SAID THAT YOU OUGHT TO RESPECT MY FEELINGS SOMETIMES, ARCHIE. I ALWAYS RESPECT YOUR FEELINGS. NOW SIT THE HELL DOWN. NO! I AIN'T GONNA SIT DOWN JUST 'CAUSE YOU TELL ME TO SIT DOWN. WELL, AS LONG AS YOU'RE UP THERE ON YOUR FEET, UH, WHAT WOULD YOU THINK ABOUT GETTIN' ME A BEER? NO. I AIN'T GONNA GET YOU A BEER JUST 'CAUSE YOU TELL ME TO GET YOU A BEER.
