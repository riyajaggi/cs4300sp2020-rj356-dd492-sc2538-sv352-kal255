 All in the Family (1971–1979): Season 5, Episode 22 - Edith's Friend - full transcript 
 Edith goes to Scranton to attend a family wedding and meets up with her aunts, who remind her of her cousin Roy, whom she knew as a child. Later, in a restaurant, Edith runs into cousin Roy and the two rekindle the old days. He makes it clear that they aren't really blood relatives and, without words, makes it understood that he is interested in her romantically. Edith becomes conflicted because she knows how charming Roy is, and even begins to share some of the same feelings. Just before the wedding, Roy comes by her hotel room and the two share a dance together, but before things get too far, Edith fakes a phone call to Archie back home. Roy, out of respect, quietly leaves. Back home, Edith is touched that Archie missed her and while hugging him looks at the corsage that Roy gave her and throws it away.

YOU WERE ALWAYS SWEET ON HIM, WEREN'T YOU, EDITH? OH, NO. NO, I WAS... (Clara) NOW, COME ON NOW, EDITH. WHY, EVERY TIME YOU PLAYED "POST OFFICE", HE ALWAYS HAD SPECIAL DELIVERIES FOR YOU. NO, SOME OF THEM WAS JUST AIR MAILS. ALL I EVER GOT WAS "RETURN TO SENDER." OH, YOU KNOW THAT, UH, ROY'S WIFE PASSED AWAY 3 YEARS AGO? OH, YEAH, I HEARD. POOR MAN. BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE GOT MARRIED AGAIN, REAL SOON. NO, THESE DAYS MEN DON'T BUY. THEY RENT. WE GOTTA BE GOIN'. YOU KNOW, THE NIGHT AIR'S NOT GOOD FOR MY VOICE. THE DAY AIR ISN'T SO GOOD EITHER. YOU'RE NOT SINGING AT THIS WEDDING, CLARA. I AM, TOO, SINGING. YOU ARE NOT SINGING. YOU ARE A JINX. EVERY WEDDING YOU'VE EVER SUNG AT ENDED IN DIVORCE. THAT AIN'T TRUE. I SANG AT ARCHIE AND EDITH'S WEDDIN'. THAT'S EVEN WORSE. IT ENDED IN MARRIAGE. BYE, SEE YOU TOMORROW. YEAH, SEE YOU IN CHURCH. THANK YOU. WOULD MADAME CARE FOR A COCKTAIL? OH, NO, THANK YOU. UH, WOULD MADAME CARE TO ORDER NOW? JUST A MINUTE. [clears throat] WOULD MADAME CARE TO GIVE ME A KISS? [exclaims] ROY! OH, ROY JOHNSON! [exclaiming] EDITH. IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU AFTER ALL THESE YEARS! OH! ME, TOO! OH, YOU SURE FOOLED ME! WHEN YOU ASKED FOR A KISS, I WAS GONNA CALL THE MANAGER. OH, I'M... I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T, EDITH. HE'S A LOUSY KISSER. ROY, YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT! NEITHER HAVE YOU. CAN... CAN I GET MY COFFEE AND JOIN YOU? OH, SURE! WELL, LITTLE COUSIN EDITH. REMEMBER HOW YOU USED TO COME UP TO SCRANTON EVERY SUMMER? AND YOU TOOK ME TO THE MOVIES AND THEN FOR ICE CREAM AFTERWARDS. WELL, NOT JUST ME. LOTS OF THE GUYS TOOK YOU OUT. OH, BUT YOU WAS DIFFERENT. YOU PAID. DID YOU COME TO THE WEDDING ALONE? YEAH. BUT HOW HAVE YOU BEEN, ROY? ARE YOU STILL MAKIN' THINGS WITH YOUR HANDS? MMM, YEAH, YEAH. STILL SOME PEOPLE AROUND WHO APPRECIATE FINE CABINETMAKING, THANK GOODNESS. I STILL HAVE THE JEWEL BOX YOU MADE FOR ME. OH, NO. OH, SURE. COURSE I AIN'T GOT NO JEWELS TO PUT IN IT, [chuckles] SO I USE IT FOR MY HAIRPINS. I STILL GOT SOMETHING ELSE YOU GAVE ME, TOO! OH, ROY. I WAS WONDERIN' ALL DAY YESTERDAY IF I'D SEE YOU HERE. UH, UH, BECAUSE, OF COURSE I EXPECTED ALL THE RELATIVES WOULD COME TO THE WEDDING. WELL, WHAT IS IT? LET ME SEE. OH, YEAH. REMEMBER WHEN YOU TOOK ME TO STEEPLECHASE PARK AND WE WENT ON "THE WHIP?" AND YOU FELL AGAINST ME AND SQUISHED MY ESKIMO PIE? YEAH! HERE IT IS! IT'S THE RING YOU GAVE ME OUT OF YOUR CRACKER JACK BOX. OF COURSE! I KEEP IT IN YOUR JEWEL BOX, UNDER THE HAIRPINS. ALL THIS TIME! GEE, WHIZ. WE HAD A LOT OF FUN TOGETHER, DIDN'T WE? OH. YOU REMEMBER PLAYING "POST OFFICE"? NO. WELL, YEAH, MAYBE A LITTLE. LOOK, EDITH, SINCE YOU'RE ALONE AND I'M ALONE, WHY DON'T I TAKE YOU TO THE WEDDING TOMORROW? WELL... YEAH, I GUESS IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT, SINCE WE'RE COUSINS. [clears throat] WE'RE NOT REALLY COUSINS, EDITH. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SURE, WE USED TO CALL EACH OTHER "COUSIN", BUT I KNOW WE'RE NOT FIRST COUSINS BECAUSE MY AUNT AND UNCLE HAD 3 KIDS AND YOU WEREN'T ONE OF THEM. WELL, THEN WE MUST BE SECOND COUSINS. NO, NO, I DON'T THINK SO. OH, WELL, THEN I GUESS IT'S THIRD OR FOURTH COUSINS. NO, NO, A THIRD COUSIN WOULD BE ONCE REMOVED FROM A SECOND COUSIN, AND A FOURTH COUSIN WOULD BE A SECOND COUSIN TWICE REMOVED. TWICE REMOVED FROM WHAT? FROM THE FIRST COUSIN. LOOK, YOUR AUNT CLARA IS YOUR MOTHER'S SISTER, RIGHT? NO, AUNT CLARA IS MY FATHER'S SISTER. THE ONLY AUNT I COULD HAVE ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE WOULD BE MY UNCLE HERMAN'S WIFE. AND HE NEVER HAD NO WIFE. SO, THE ONLY THING I GOT FROM MY MOTHER WAS AN UNCLE. BUT, YOU SEE, YOUR AUNT CLARA'S SISTER, ROSE, WAS MARRIED TO MY MOTHER'S BROTHER-IN-LAW. SO THAT MADE HER MY AUNT ROSE BY MARRIAGE, SEE? WELL, THEN, WHAT DOES THAT MAKE US? TOTAL STRANGERS. YOU MEAN THERE AIN'T NO BLOOD BETWEEN US? NO, NOT A DROP. [exclaims] OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE. WHY? IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING, EDITH. WELL... IF WE AIN'T COUSINS, WHAT ARE WE? WE'RE JUST VERY GOOD FRIENDS. OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, GLORIA. IT'S LIKE OLD HOME WEEK UP HERE, WITH AUNT ROSE AND AUNT CLARA AND EVERYBODY. YEAH. I'M GONNA STAY HERE TONIGHT AND I'M GONNA TAKE THE BUS HOME TOMORROW. [knocking on door] OH, THERE'S SOMEBODY AT THE DOOR, GLORIA. I GOTTA GO NOW, GOOD-BYE. COMING, ROY! (Rose) IT'S NOT ROY, IT'S ROSE. (Clara) WHAT ABOUT ME? AND CLARA. OH! YOU LOOK LOVELY! EDITH. WELL, EDITH, I'VE GOT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO ASK YOU. EDITH, CAN I SING? WELL, SURE, IT'S A FREE COUNTRY. I DON'T MEAN, "CAN I SING?" I MEAN, "CAN I SING?" OH! WELL... EDITH, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN AFRAID TO TELL THE TRUTH EVEN WHEN IT HURTS. NOW, DON'T TRY TO INFLUENCE HER. WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER, EDITH? WHAT WAS THE QUESTION? THE QUESTION IS: YOU THINK I'M A VERY GOOD SINGER, DON'T YOU? EDITH, THE TRUTH. WELL, ARCHIE SAYS THAT I GET MY VOICE FROM YOU, CLARA. THE WHOLE FAMILY EXPECTS ME TO SING. CLARA, THERE'S A FINE LINE BETWEEN EXPECTATION AND DREAD. IT'S UP TO YOU, EDITH. DO I SING AT THE WEDDING? WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY, EDITH? WELL... YOU WANNA SING, DON'T YOU, CLARA? WITH ALL MY HEART. AND, ROSE, YOU DON'T WANNA HEAR HER SING. WITH ALL MY HEART. WELL, THEN, IT'S SIMPLE! CLARA, YOU SING, AND, ROSE, YOU DON'T LISTEN! THANK YOU.

THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S A LITTLE OUT-OF-DATE BUT I GOT IT AT A SALE. I'VE ALWAYS LIKED YOU IN A HAT. YOU'VE GOT A HAT KIND OF HEAD, YOU KNOW. THANK YOU. HERE. HERE'S SOMETHING TO WEAR WITH IT. VIOLETS! MY FAVORITE! YEAH, I REMEMBER. OH, WE USED TO PICK 'EM IN McGREGOR WOODS AFTER WE FINISHED PLAYING "TAKE A GIANT STEP." REMEMBER? "GO BACK, GO BACK, YOU DIDN'T SAY 'MAY I?'" UH, MAY I? OH. [giggling] HERE. THANK YOU. AIN'T THIS A NICE ROOM? DO YOU LIKE THE PICTURES? YEAH. THAT'S ANOTHER THING WE'VE GOT IN COMMON, EDITH. I'VE GOT THE SAME PICTURES IN MY ROOM. YOU DO? I THINK THEY MUST BE VERY VALUABLE. THEY'RE BOLTED TO THE WALL. CAN I BORROW YOUR THUMB? THAT ALL DEPENDS ON WHICH ONE YOU WANT. THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT? [giggling] YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING LAST NIGHT AFTER I LEFT YOU? NO, WHAT? I WAS WONDERING, WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED IF WE KNEW WE WEREN'T COUSINS WHEN WE WERE KIDS TOGETHER. I HOPE GRACE LIKES THE WEDDING PRESENT. IT'S ONE OF THEM CLOCK RADIOS WITH ALL THEM BUTTONS. YOU KNOW, YOU PRESS A BUTTON IF YOU WANNA WAKE UP TO THE ALARM OR YOU PRESS ANOTHER BUTTON IF YOU WANNA WAKE UP TO MUSIC? OR, I-I-IF YOU DON'T WANNA PRESS NO BUTTONS, YOU JUST, UH, WAKE UP WHEN YOUR EYES OPEN. [giggling] DO YOU REALIZE, EDITH, THAT WE WERE UP UNTIL AFTER 1:00 THIS MORNING TALKIN'? WE SPENT MORE THAN 7 HOURS TOGETHER. AND IT ALL SEEMED LIKE A... LIKE A HALF AN HOUR. I WANTED TO GET GRACE A, UH, AN ELECTRIC BLANKET BUT ARCHIE SAYS PRESIDENT FORD THINKS IT'S WRONG TO WASTE ENERGY IN BED. DID YOU, UH, DID YOU ENJOY OUR WALK LAST NIGHT? OH, YEAH. OH, IT WAS SO NICE SEEIN' THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD. IN QUEENS, NOBODY WALKS AT NIGHT NO MORE. NOBODY WALKS? WELL, THE PEOPLE THAT DO ARE THE REASON THE OTHERS DON'T. EDITH, WE STILL HAVE LOTS OF TIME, YOU KNOW. HERE, LET ME. OH. YOU'D LOVE PRINCETON, THOUGH, EDITH. OH, I THINK IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR ME TO GO TO COLLEGE. NO, I MEAN THE TOWN. I MEAN, THAT'S WHERE I LIVE. YOU KNOW, IT'S... YOU CAN WALK THERE, AND TOUCH ALL THOSE BIG TREES IN THE STREETS. OH. YEAH, IF YOU TOUCH A TREE IN NEW YORK, YOUR HAND GETS FULL OF DIRT. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT ANY PLACE WAS, UH, WHO YOU WERE WITH. THAT'S TRUE! ALL THIS MORNING I WAS THINKIN' AGAIN ABOUT STEEPLECHASE PARK AND YOUR CRACKER JACK RING. IT WAS LIKE I WAS LOOKIN' AT A PHOTO ALBUM. YOU IN YOUR BLUE SUIT. THE ESKIMO PIE ON IT. [laughing] AND ME WITH A BIG BALL OF COTTON CANDY. AND WE WERE DANCIN' IN THE DARK. THAT'S RIGHT. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT THE BAND WAS PLAYIN'? NO. DROVE THE SHADOWS AWAY. DROVE THE SHADOWS AWAY? MMM-HMM. HOW DOES THAT GO? ♪ LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, DROVE THE SHADOWS AWAY! ♪ YOU'RE RIGHT.
