 HE WILL? OH, YEAH. I DIDN'T THINK ARCHIE WOULD WANNA GIVE LAST NIGHT'S FAREWELL PARTY. BUT WHEN I ASKED HIM, HE SAID, "SURE, I'D LOVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO GEORGE JEFFERSON." ISN'T THAT INTERESTING? GEORGE SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT ARCHIE. LOUISE, I JUS... OH, HI, AGAIN, EDITH. OH, HI. HAVEN'T YOU FINISHED PACKING YET? I'D BE FINISHED A LOT QUICKER, IF YOU'D HELP ME. WHY? YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GONNA BE DOIN' THE UNPACKIN'. NOW IF I WAS TO DO THE PACKIN', YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE ANYTHING WAS. SO, ACTUALLY, I AM HELPING YOU BY NOT HELPING. OH, WELL, MAYBE I'M IN THE WAY. I'LL COME BACK LATER AND SAY GOOD-BYE. OH, GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE. UH, GEORGE, I'VE BEEN THINKING, MAYBE WE'RE NOT DOIN' THE RIGHT THING BY MOVING. YOU KNOW SOMETHING LOUISE? I'VE BEEN DOIN' A LOT OF THINKIN', TOO. YOU HAVE? MMM-HMM. AND I'VE BEEN THINKIN', "WHY THE HELL DON'T YOU LEAVE THE THINKIN' UP TO ME?" BECAUSE AT YOUR AGE IT'S TOO LATE TO START SOMETHING NEW. WATCH IT. GEORGE, MOVING TO EAST SIDE MANHATTAN, WITH ALL THOSE FANCY FOLKS. MONEY IS WHAT MAKES THEM FANCY. NOW, WE'RE GONNA BE FANCY, TOO. LOOK. TOMORROW I'M OPENIN' MY 3rd CLEANING STORE AND THERE'LL BE A 4th, 5th AND 6th. WE'RE ON OUR WAY UP. WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT? I'M AFRAID OF GOING WHERE I DON'T BELONG. LOOK, WHEN YOU GOT THE MONEY, BABY, YOU BELONG. GEORGE, WE ARE JUST PLAIN FOLKS. NO. NOT ANYMORE. SEE, WE WAS PLAIN FOLKS $47,000.50 AGO. BUT, GEORGE, EAST SIDE MANHATTAN? THOSE ARE NOT MY KIND OF PEOPLE. SO, IF YOU GET LONELY, WE'LL BUS IN SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS. EXCEPT FOR HONKY NEXT DOOR. WHY IS IT MY WHITE FRIENDS ARE "HONKY" AND YOUR WHITE FRIENDS ARE "MISTER"? WHAT WHITE FRIENDS? THOSE GUYS YOU'VE BEEN TAKING TO LUNCH ALL WEEK. IF THEY ARE BLACK, I AM DORIS DAY. LOOK, THOSE GUYS WORK AT WHITTENDALE NATIONAL BANK AND BANKERS AIN'T NOBODY'S FRIENDS. LOOK, I WANT THEM TO GET ME IN TO SEE OLD MAN WHITTENDALE HIMSELF. SO I CAN HIT ON HIM FOR MY BUSINESS LOAN. I DON'T GET IT. IF WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SO RICH, WHY DO WE NEED TO BORROW MONEY? BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY RICH PEOPLE OPERATE. LOOK, BANKS DON'T MAKE LOANS TO PEOPLE WHO NEED MONEY. THAT'S WHAT PAWN SHOPS ARE FOR. LOUISE, I BOUGHT YOU SOME FRUIT FOR YOUR TRIP. WE'RE ONLY GOING TO MANHATTAN. WELL, SUBWAYS BREAK DOWN SOMETIMES. WELL, EDITH, I GUESS THIS IS REALLY GOOD-BYE. I KNOW. WELL, I'LL JUST SAY, SO LONG. SO LONG, EDITH. LOUISE.

NOW, JUST BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO BE WHITE... IT AIN'T JUST THAT. I WOULDN'T LIKE HIM EVEN IF HE WAS BLACK. WHICH I'M GLAD HE AIN'T, SINCE I DON'T LIKE HIM. WHY? 'CAUSE HE'S TOO FRIENDLY. HE'S ONE OF 'EM, TOUCHY-FEELY GUYS. LIKE A GREAT BIG, WHITE POLAR BEAR ALWAYS GRABBIN', HUGGIN' AND SQUEEZIN'. WELL, I THINK THE WILLIS' ARE WARM, LOVELY PEOPLE, AND I LIKE THEM. THEN DO IT LONG DISTANCE, 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM IN HERE. HEY, UH, MR. JEFFERSON. THANKS A LOT FOR SHOWING ME THIS APARTMENT. AND I GOTTA BE GOIN'. OH, WHAT A SHAME.

HI, NEIGHBOR. HERE IT COMES. TOUCHY-FEELY, TOUCHY-FEELY, TOUCHY-FEELY. IMAGINE, ALL OF US LIVING IN THE SAME BUILDING. ISN'T IT A SMALL WORLD? TOO SMALL. LIONEL, I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU IN THE KITCHEN. NOW. EXCUSE ME. I THINK SOMETHING'S BOILIN' OVER. MAYBE I SQUEEZED HIM TOO HARD, HUH? NOT HARD ENOUGH, TOM. HE'S STILL BREATHING. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THEY'RE LIVIN' HERE? WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME? YOU MEAN TO TELL ME I GOTTA ASK YOU IF THE SKY IS FALLIN' BEFORE YOU TELL ME. GEORGE, YOU KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN. WE HAVE GOT GUESTS. NO, WE DON'T. WE GOT TRESPASSERS. DID YOU HEAR THAT, TOM? MOM. COME ON, GIVE MR. JEFFERSON A CHANCE. WELL, AFTER ALL, YOU DID COME HERE WITHOUT WARNING. HE JUST WASN'T PREPARED. HIS MOUTH WAS. I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A PREPARED MOUTH. NOW, HELEN, YOU'VE GOT TO BE MORE TOLERANT. JUST SAY TO YOURSELF, "THE MAN'S AN IDIOT AND WE HAVE TO MAKE ALLOWANCES." GEORGE, COME BACK HERE! NOW, LOOK. WE CAME DOWN HERE IN THE SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP. THEN THAT'S A GOOD WAY FOR YOU TO LEAVE. IN THE SPIRIT OF FRIENDSHIP. NOW, LOOK HERE, SHORTY. WHO YOU CALLIN' SHORTY? SHE DON'T MEAN ME. I'M WARNING YOU, LOUISE, THERE'S ONLY ONE SIDE MY WIFE CAN BE ON. THAT'S EITHER MY SIDE OR OUTSIDE. WHY CAN'T WE ALL BE ON THE SAME SIDE? (Jenny) RIGHT. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, POP. 'CAUSE THEY'RE ALL GONNA BE YOUR IN-LAWS, SO WHY DON'T YOU TRY GETTIN' ALONG? OK, SON. YOU REALLY WANNA GET ALONG? YOU BET. OK. WELL, I TRIED IT AND I DON'T LIKE IT. SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST MOVE OUT OF THE BUILDING? WHAT? SURE, IT'S ONLY FAIR. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH TROUBLE I HAD GETTING INTO THIS BUILDING? THE ONLY REASON I GOT IN HERE WAS BECAUSE I HAD ENOUGH GREEN TO COVER MY BLACK. NOW, SEE, YOU'RE WHITE. YOU CAN GET IN ANY PLACE YOU WANT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HIDE YOUR WIFE IN A WOODPILE UNTIL THE LEASE IS SIGNED. WELL, HERE'S A MESSAGE FROM THE WOODPILE. IF ANYBODY'S MOVING, IT'S YOU, SHORTY. OK. IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT IT, THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GONNA BE. WE ARE MOVING. GEORGE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WHERE YOU CAN'T FOLLOW. GEORGE, COME OUT OF THERE. (George) I AIN'T COMIN' OUT TILL THEY LEAVE. COME ON, LET'S GO. BUT... WE'LL SEE OURSELVES OUT. DON'T BOTHER TO GET UP. LIONEL, YOU BETTER GO TO YOUR ROOM. I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HIT BY YOUR FATHER. WHY'S HE GONNA HIT ME? BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE WHERE I'M GONNA THROW HIM. ALL RIGHT, GEORGE. THEY'VE GONE. YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN YOU ACT DUMB BEFORE. BUT NOW I'M CONVINCED YOU WASN'T ACTING. WHATEVER YOU SAY, LOUISE. WHATEVER YOU SAY. HUH? I'M A BEATEN MAN, LOUISE. YOU WANNA KICK A MAN WHEN HE'S DOWN, GO AHEAD. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT'S ALL OVER. ALL MY PLANS, ALL MY DREAMS, ALL THAT DOUGH, DOWN THE DRAIN. OH, COME OFF IT, POP. AND TO THINK MY OWN FAMILY DID IT TO ME. SEE, THAT'S WHAT HURTS SO BAD. IT'S NOT JUST THE IDEA OF THOSE PEOPLE LIVING UPSTAIRS, IT'S THAT NOBODY EVER TOLD ME. IF YOU'D STUCK A KNIFE IN MY BACK, YOU COULDN'T HAVE HURT ME MORE. OH, GEORGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JEZEBEL. WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT? LET ME TRY TALKIN' TO HIM, MA. [Lionel sighing] POP. WHAT IS IT, JEZEBEL JR.? LOOK, POP, I'M TRYIN' TO TALK TO YOU. WILL YOU LOOK AT ME? I SMELL GAS. ONE OF THEM PILOT LIGHTS MUST BE OUT. HEY, LOOK, MOM DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE WILLIS' MOVIN' IN. IT WAS ALL MY DOIN', ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE JUST HAVE TO UNDO YOUR DOIN' AND MOVE OUT OF HERE. HEY, POP, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BREAK UP JENNY AND ME, IT'S NOT GONNA WORK. AND IT'S SILLY TO MOVE OUT BECAUSE THIS BUILDING IS BIG ENOUGH. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SEE THE WILLIS' IF YOU DON'T WANT TO. I'LL KNOW THEY'RE THERE. I'LL FEEL 'EM. IT'S JUST LIKE THE PRINCESS THAT STEPPED ON THE PEA. LIONEL, YOU'VE DONE ME IN. I GIVE UP. IS HE ALL RIGHT? WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE? NOTHIN'. I COULDN'T GET THROUGH TO HIM. I'VE NEVER SEEN POP SO LOW BEFORE. OH, LOOK, I'M GOING TO GO UPSTAIRS AND APOLOGIZE TO THE WILLIS'. [doorbell ringing] OH, HI, GRANDMA. HELLO. MOTHER JEFFERSON, WHAT A NICE SURPRISE. HELLO, LOUISE. I WAS PASSING BY AND THOUGHT I'D DROP IN. WELL, I'M SO GLAD YOU DID. I FIGURED THIS WOULD BE QUICKER THAN WAITING FOR AN INVITATION. WELL, UH, HOW DO YOU LIKE OUR NEW APARTMENT? OH, IT'S LOVELY. JUST BEAUTIFUL. GEORGE HAS SUCH GOOD TASTE. IN MOST THINGS. GEORGE, YOUR MOTHER IS HERE. GEORGE. I'LL GET HIM. GEORGE... [screams] GEORGE! (Louise) OH, MY GOD! GEORGE, I BEG OF YOU, DON'T TAKE YOUR LIFE! AIN'T NOBODY TAKIN' NOBODY'S LIFE. I GOT BUSINESS IN THERE. THE PILOT LIGHT IS OUT. I THOUGHT YOU WAS TRYING TO KILL YOURSELF. WHAT FOR? I GOT A FAMILY THAT'S ALREADY DOIN' THAT. WELL, YOU BETTER PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, GEORGE. YOU'VE GOT A VISITOR. WELL, TELL HIM TO GO TO HELL. WHATEVER YOU SAY, GEORGE. IT'S YOUR MOTHER. OH, SON, YOU HAVE SUCH A LOVELY APARTMENT. YEAH, WELL, GET A GOOD LAST LOOK AT IT, MAMA, 'CAUSE WE'RE MOVIN' OUT. BUT WE'VE GOT A 3-YEAR LEASE. THAT AIN'T NOTHIN'. I'M GONNA CALL THE REAL ESTATE AGENT RIGHT NOW. I KNOW WE'LL HAVE NO TROUBLE SUBLETTIN' THIS APARTMENT. MAYBE EVEN MAKE A FEW BUCKS ON THE DEAL. HELLO, AGAIN. I WAS DOWNSTAIRS IN THE DELI WHEN IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE ANY FOOD IN YET. HOW DO YOU DO? SO I BROUGHT YOU SOME BANGERS. BANGERS? YES. UH, ENGLISH SAUSAGES. WELL, WHY DO THEY CALL THEM BANGERS? I REALLY DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE AFTER EFFECTS, I THINK. AH! THE FUNNIEST THING JUST HAPPENED TO ME. I GOT ON THE ELEVATOR WITH MR. AND MRS. WHITTENDALE, AND I FORGOT TO PUSH THE BUTTON FOR MY FLOOR. WHITTENDALE? YES, HENRY AND JANET WHITTENDALE. THEY LIVE IN THE PENTHOUSE, WHICH IS THE POINT OF THE STORY, YOU SEE. THERE I AM... HENRY L. WHITTENDALE? YES, HE'S A CHARMING FELLOW. SO, AS WE'RE TRAVELING UPWARD, YOU SEE... WHITTENDALE-BANK WHITTENDALE? RIGHT. UH, HE'S VERY EASY TO TALK TO. SO JUST AS WE'RE PASSING MY FLOOR... [laughing] BOY, THAT WAS A GREAT STORY. DID I FINISH IT? SURE, YOU DID. IT WAS A GREAT STORY. YOU HEARD HOW HARD I WAS LAUGHIN'. BOY, YOU'RE REALLY HILARIOUS. I NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. LOOK, ANYTIME YOU WANT YOUR BACK WALKED ON, JUST BRING IT ON OVER. YOU KNOW... WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, LOUISE? START UNPACKING. BUT YOU SAID YOU'D NEVER LIVE HERE. DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID? WHITTENDALE LIVES IN THE PENTHOUSE. WHO? WHITTENDALE. THE OWNER OF THE BANK I DO BUSINESS WITH. SO? SO, WHITTENDALE RIDES THE ELEVATOR. I RIDE THE ELEVATOR. SOME OF THE BIGGEST DEALS ARE MADE IN ELEVATORS. THIS IS MY BIG CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW THE PEOPLE UPSTAIRS. [doorbell ringing] DOORBELL, DEAR. MAY WE COME IN? UH. OH, OF COURSE, YOU MAY. UH-UH-UH, NOW, BEFORE YOU LOCK YOURSELF IN THE JOHN AGAIN, WE JUST CAME DOWN TO SAY WE THINK YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT MOVING. BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE KIDS, AT LEAST, LET'S PART FRIENDS. OH, BUT WE'RE NOT MOVING. YOU'RE NOT? NO. AS A MATTER OF FACT, GEORGE INSISTED THAT WE STAY. HE SAID, IT WAS HIS BIG CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW THE PEOPLE UPSTAIRS. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, GEORGE? THAT'S GREAT. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A FAREWELL GIFT, BUT NOW IT WORKS OUT EVEN BETTER. HERE. WHAT'S THIS FOR? IT'S FOR DRINKING A LITTLE TOAST. UNLESS YOU'VE GOT A BATTLESHIP AROUND HERE YOU'D LIKE TO LAUNCH. YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT, MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. AH, COME ON NOW, LET'S SEE A SMILE ON THAT OLD KISSER, HUH? NOW, COME ON, COME ON. OH, HERE IT COMES, FOLKS. OH, WE'RE GONNA BE SEEING A LOT OF EACH OTHER FROM NOW ON. TOUCHY-FEELY, TOUCHY-FEELY.
