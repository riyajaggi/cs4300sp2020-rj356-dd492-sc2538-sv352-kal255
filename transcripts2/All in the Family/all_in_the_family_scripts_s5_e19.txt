 Edith's cousin Amelia and her husband Russell comes to visit despite the fact that Archie can't stand either one.

Separately, both Edith and Archie find out how much trouble Russell and Amelia's marriage is in. Amelia tells Edith that she is ready to divorce Russell because the fire has gone out of their sex life. Meanwhile Russell tells Archie about his appetite for young girls. Returning home, Russell and Amelia say their goodbyes leaving Archie and Edith with a new appreciation of their relationship.

 YEAH. WELL, I'LL GO THERE WHEN THE REVEREND FLETCHER GETS TAKEN OUT. HE SAYS THAT THE LORD SMILES ON HIS SHEEP WHEN THEY ARE IN HIS FOLD. WELL, THE LORD MAYBE SMILIN' ON HIS SHEEPS, BUT THEY STILL WIND UP LAMB CHOPS, EDITH. HE ASKED ME AGAIN WHY YOU WASN'T WITH ME? WELL, I HOPE YOU TOLD HIM THAT SUNDAY IS MY DAY OF REST. AND IF I HAVE TO JUMP OUT OF BED AND TEAR OFF TO CHURCH, HOW AM I GOIN' TO GET THAT REST? [sighing] OH, YEAH. WELL, I DIDN'T REST TOO GOOD NEITHER. I TOSSED ALL NIGHT. HOW DID YOU COME UP THIS MORNIN'? HEADS OR TAILS? [giggles] NO, I WAS WORRYIN' ABOUT MIKE AND GLORIA SLEEPIN' UP THERE IN THAT COLD MOUNTAIN CABIN. [shivering] I HOPE THEY WAS WARM ENOUGH. OH, JEEZ, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM TWO. THEY COULD SET A WATER BED BOILIN'. YOU GONNA CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES? WHY, I AIN'T GOING NOWHERES. I GONNA SIT HERE, READ MY PAPER, WATCH T.V., DRINK MY BEER. AND TALK TO MY COUSIN AMELIA AND RUSSELL. HUH? REMEMBER? THEY'RE COMIN' TO VISIT TODAY. WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE. DON'T LAY A THING LIKE THAT ON ME AND THEN DISAPPEAR INSIDE THE KITCHEN. I DON'T WANNA BE STUCK WITH THEM. WHY DIDN'T YOU REMIND ME THEY WAS COMIN'? WELL, I DID YESTERDAY, TWICE. WHILE YOU WAS READIN' THE PAPER AND BOTH TIMES YOU SAID, "FINE." AH, YOU KNOW I NEVER LISTEN TO YOU WHEN I SAY "FINE." AMELIA'S BAD ENOUGH, BUT THAT BIG-MOUTHED PLUMBER HUSBAND OF HERS... HE'S ALWAYS SITTIN' IN MY CHAIR, BLOWIN' OFF ABOUT ALL HIS MONEY. OH, RUSSELL'S GOT A RIGHT TO. AMELIA SAYS HE'S DOIN' WONDERFUL. HE JUST DID ALL THE PLUMBIN' FOR A GREAT BIG CITY HOUSING PROJECT. BIG DEAL. WHAT DOES THAT MAKE HIM? PRINCE OF THE PUBLIC POTTIES? I THINK YOU'RE GETTIN' A LITTLE JEALOUS OF RUSSELL. NO, I AIN'T JEALOUS. LISTEN, ALL I GOT TO SAY IS THAT RICH PEOPLE OUGHT TO KEEP QUIET ABOUT THEIR MONEY. IN FACT, I THINK THEY OUGHT TO BE A LITTLE ASHAMED OF IT. YOU KNOW, TAKE YOUR NELSON D. ROCKEFELLER THERE. HE WAS SO, WHAT YOU CALL, MODEST ABOUT IT, HE WOULDN'T EVEN TELL THE CONGRESS HOW MUCH HE HAD. THEY HAD TO DRAG IT OUT OF HIM. NOW, THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL CLASS. OH, I DON'T THINK RUSSELL WILL TALK ABOUT HIS MONEY TODAY. THEY JUST GOT BACK FROM HAWAII. HE'LL PROBABLY TALK ABOUT HIS VACATION. SURE, HE'LL TELL ME ALL ABOUT HOW MUCH IT COSTS. HE'LL BE GIVIN' ME THE FIGURES INSIDE THE FIRST 30 SECONDS HE'S HERE. YOU WAIT AND SEE. FINE. OH, ARCHIE, I LIKE RUSSELL AND HE'S SO GOOD TO AMELIA. THEIR MARRIAGE WAS MADE IN HEAVEN. WHERE THE HELL WAS OURS MADE? IN JAPAN? MAYBE YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS OF AMELIA, THERE, TOO, HUH? OH, NO! NOW, WELL, LISTEN, JUST BECAUSE SOME GUY BUYS FURS AND DIAMONDS FOR HIS WIFE, THAT DON'T MAKE HIM A GOOD HUSBAND. I AM TALKIN' ABOUT ALL THE LITTLE THINGS HE DOES FOR HER.
