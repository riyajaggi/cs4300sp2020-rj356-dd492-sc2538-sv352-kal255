 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES BAD WRITER Good morning, sunshine. Did you sleep well? Hmm? Like a princess. MOM Who is it? Mom. We've been invited to dinner. Hey. What is it? I just... I don't think your mom likes me very much. That's just nonsense. Mom loves you. Everybody loves Olivia. You're the loveliest girl in the world.

 Love you guys. You're the best. Hey, where did you say you were going? To the writing class. Was that today? Yes. I've told you a hundred times. It's like it's completely empty in there. If you weren't so cute, you'd be in trouble. Girls, high five! Take an umbrella. It's supposed to rain. I don't need one. This is going to be a perfect day. I can feel it. Nice Porsche. It was a birthday present from my mom and dad. Are you in the writing class? Yes. Writing class. My name is Alex. Olivia. And that's what life is. Light versus darkness. Life and death. You there. What's your name? Olivia. I want you to tell me... about the worst experience in your life. When was the last time... your life was a living hell? I was 12. And my pony died. - Your pony died. - Mm. Yeah, that's sad. And you cried, right? Yes, I did. But are you crying still? No. My parents gave me a new one. - They gave you a new... - Pony. New pony. Okay. Anyway. When you're shaking in the bowels of Hell, which is the only way forward? Up? Yup. Olivia, you're clever and cute. When your characters are at rock bottom... well, then something good has to happen, right? But if your characters are doing too well, then it's your duty as writers to throw some dirt in their faces. The writer is God. Anything can happen. Maybe you want to draw inspiration from your own life. You decide. After all, you always have the option to delete. Is there anyone you hate? Write them into your story. And kill them. Oh, my God, that was intense. She's absolutely amazing. Yes. Um, fantastic. What's that? Just something I wrote. A story. You've written a story? - Do you want me to read it? - No, no. It's nothing. It's just... Amateurish. Hopeless. - Okay. - Mm. - See you later. - Yup. - Alex, right? - Bye. - Bye. - Olivia. "May I have the last apple?" Bitch, I'm standing here eating it. I'm sorry, but she's so fucking annoying. - Hell, yeah. - I know. And all that bragging. "Oh, Mom and Dad are rich. They buy me ponies and Porsches." So, why are you always late with the rent, then? She doesn't give a fuck about anyone but herself. You know what I want to do? Fuck with her head. Humiliate her. We can take her to the park and run off with all of her clothes. And take nude pictures of her and put them on Instagram. She would die. Die, huh. It would be great if she just died. Seriously, we'd be doing the world a favor. Can we do that? It would be amazing. Just to put a knife in her. Let's do it. Let's get the fucking bitch. We'll invite her to a picnic or something. And then we'll kill her and bury her in the woods. I'm in. Shit. I'm in. Anybody want a cup of tea? Olivia? You're home? Yes. I just walked in. We're having some tea. Do you want some? I'd love some, thanks. So? How was the writing class? It was nice. Very good. Take a seat. Okay. Do you have any plans on Saturday? I don't know. Maybe we could do a picnic. The four of us. Outside the city somewhere. Hmm? Yes! Picnic. - I love picnics. - Great. Then we'll have a picnic. - Yes... - Where are you going? Uh, I just don't feel very... - Did you hear us? - What? Hear you? No, I just got in. I... I'm just not feeling... Hey, princess. You're back, huh? I have to go. Sunshine? I just need some air. Is something wrong? No. Um... Everything is fine, it's just... You look pale. Give me the key. Give me the key! - What? - You're in on it, I know you are. I fell asleep. What are you talking about? - You want to kill me. - Hey... I really don't know what you're talking about. There, there. It's going to be all right. Just come with me. Fucking hell. Mom was right. You're absolutely crazy. Go. Go! My boyfriend... I stabbed him with my car key. They all want to kill me. Go! They hate me. You're the guy from the writing class. Yes. I was just driving by, so... Do you want me to take you somewhere? I have to think. It's like my whole life just... It was a totally perfect day. A totally perfect day. Do you want to go to the police? Yes. Yes. Thank you. - Thank you for stopping. - Of course. Oh. Thank you. - You have to help me now. - There's a long line. You'll have to wait. I didn't find her. Can you take a look? Maybe she ran out the other side. She's not here. What? Alex? Huh? Just to put a knife in her. It would be amazing. You're the loveliest girl in the world. "Oh, Mom and Dad are so rich. They buy me ponies and Porsches." Mom was right. You're absolutely crazy. THROW DIRT IN THEIR FACES This is going to be a perfect day. It's your duty as writers to throw dirt in their faces. It's just something I wrote. A story. THERE'S A WRITER WRITING ABOUT ME. SITTING IN HIS UGLY CAR, PICKING HIS NOSE. Hmm. BUT THE DISGUSTING MAN HAS WRITTEN HIS LAST STORY. FOR ALL OF A SUDDEN, HIS COMPUTER TURNS INTO A MONSTER! AND THEN, WHEN HE CAN'T COME, HIS PHONE RINGS. HE ANSWERS. ALEX: HELLO? Hello? Who is this? Do you recognize my voice? Huh? No. You know me better than anyone. - You wrote me. Olivia. - No. Your Olivia. I found a part of your story. Apparently, I'm just a character... that you've made up. - Olivia... - I'll make sure you never write again. I'm so sorry. You've ruined my life. Don't take it personally. I like you, Olivia. I like you a lot. I was just writing down a fantasy. It was perfect. So... How did you plan to end your story? I intended it to end well. I just had to get you... to hit rock bottom first. - And then things would turn around? - Yes. "When you've hit rock bottom, things can only get better." My Mac ate my hand. Thank you. Okay. We need to talk. You know the sushi place on the corner, where I first met Marcus? Is that real? - Or did you make that up? - No, no. It's there. Okay. I'm not quite sure how these things work, but if I write that you go there, and you write that I go there, maybe we can restart the story. Yes. I just love this place. The details, the atmosphere. The Samurai swords. I just wanted to tell you that you look... absolutely smashing. What made you decide to write about me? This is the first time I've tried writing, so, I'm completely hopeless, an amateur. But my wife, she... She's the writer in the family. I'm in your wife's writing class. And you're in your wife's writing class. I thought I'd try learning... something. Why are you smiling? This has been an absolutely awful day. But then it got better. Isn't it so that "if the character has reached rock bottom, - it has to get better"? - "But if they're doing too well, - something awful needs to happen." - Not necessarily. Not if this is the end... and we get a happy ending. Happy ending... Weren't there three swords there? Sorry? There were three swords there just now. - Have you written...? - No. No, it wasn't me. Okay, but there used to be three swords. - Oh. - Sorry? No... What if someone is writing about... About us? Hey, princess. Marcus, please. Please. The other girls were right. You're an awful human being. I'm your princess! Mom? What do you say? - Should we let her live? - Kill her. Kill the fucking bitch. "Kill the fucking bitch!" hissed the beautiful writer, and laughed. Annelise? Mm-hm? Will you keep an eye on the pork chops? I'm getting some corn. Of course, dear. Hello! Marcus, my boy. Come here. And, Olivia, how nice. Dear daughter-in-law, you look smashing as always. - The wine? - Oh, shit. I was supposed to bring wine. I'm sorry. It's like it's completely empty up there. Mom? What are you writing these days? Oh, no. No, that's... It's nothing. Nothing. It's just a silly story. - Nothing. - I've also taken up writing. Really? Oh, just amateur stuff. But it's fun. Hey... Annelise, I... I hope it's okay that I came along. Yes, but of course. Of course, Olivia. You're so cute. Mom? Olivia? Olivia? Mom! Jesus Christ! - What have you done? - I can delete it. I haven't done anything. I can delete it. I can delete... Watch this. Olivia? Olivia! - It won't delete. - Marcus, call for an ambulance! It won't delete. It won't delete. It won't delete.
