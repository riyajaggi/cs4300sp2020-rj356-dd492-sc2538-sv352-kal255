 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES LAB RATS Dear friends. - Here you go, Iselin. - Thanks. Finally, after ten years, the day has arrived. We have outperformed our biggest competitor, Müller-Nova. We are now the world's leading pharmaceutical company. We have made an antidepressant that actually works. Without any side effects. Well, almost.

 This is cause for celebration, and that is why you're here. Because you're the ones I hold dearest. You're my people. So, girls, Oda, Margrethe, thank you for always taking care of us boys. - Thanks to the boys at the lab. - Cheers. Brilliant, hardworking Philip, and a special thanks to Abdi. The young Einstein, who came in at the 11th hour and solved the final puzzle. Without you, Philip would still be muddling about in the lab. And thank you, Iselin, for putting up with your workaholic husband. I should be the one thanking you. Now it's time to drink. Now it's time to mingle... and to brag relentlessly about ourselves. Because, hell, we deserve it!

 Yes. And then we'll devour a deer. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Poor Arthur Müller. The German bastard. I told him we'd have it on the market by December, and I thought he was going to blow a fuse. I just love that moment. When you're looking at someone... right at that second... when they realize they've been screwed. Oh. Hey, Oda. Listen to a little bit of corporate wisdom. - "Edmund's three commandments." - Indeed. Always be the smartest one in the room. Hmm? Two. Never trust anyone but yourself. And number three. Always make sure... that the pocket square matches your tie. No, no, let's not forget who's the real genius in the room. Um... Here's to... Abdi. - Enough with the toasts. Enough. - No. I've met so many smart people in my life, but no one even comes close to you. - Cheers. - Cheers. - But, Edmund, um... - Hmm? ...is it possible to... see it? Margrethe, of course you can see it. Honestly, I thought you'd never ask. - No. - No. Okay. That's enough, now. - Oh, did you mean the prototype? - Yes. Of course you can see it. - Do you want me to go and get it? - Yes. Do you? Does everybody want to see it? - Yes. - Okay. - It's gone. - What? The prototype. I put it in the safe at 5:00, and now it's gone. - How... - Bill! Focus! - Who's been coming and going since then? - No one. Except your dinner guests. Fuck. Someone must have gotten hold of the code. And then before dinner... they must have snuck into the office. - It has to have been one of your guests. - Yes. One of the ones eating my deer. It's really tasty. We'll have to wait for the dessert. The prototype is gone. He's joking. He's joking. I don't think he's joking. I put it in the safe before you arrived. Bill confirms that no one has entered the building since. No one. Except the five of you. Hence, one of you knows the code to the safe. - That can't be right. - There has to be some other explanation. Are you sure you put it in the safe? Uh, Bill, you'll have to frisk them. Just... Just do it. Sorry, but nobody leaves until we get to the bottom of this. Margrethe, uh, could you stand up, please? Yes, of course. Your turn, Philip. Search away, old friend. But if I were you, I would rather focus on, uh... What? What are you talking about? - I haven't stolen anything, you fucking... - Good. Then I'm sure you won't mind us having a look. Right, Abdi? Go ahead, Bill. Take your time. Edmund, I've got nothing to do with this. We've seen each other daily for months. Yes, I know. But still... Okay. Get it over with, then. My turn. - You know what, Edmund, this is not... - It's necessary. Edmund. Edmund? - Hmm? - I'll do it. Just... Please. It must be hidden in one of their rooms. We just have to look everywhere. One of you thinks that you're smarter than me. So, who is it? Who thinks they're clever? Hmm? Who thinks they are so fucking clever? Undress. - No, this is too... - All of you. Now. They're laughing. Strip down to your underwear now. Well, if that's what it takes, then okay. You're going too far. I'm not undressing in front of... I... I won't do it. - Do you have anything to hide? - No. Good. Then undress. Edmund. Count to ten. And take deep breaths. I'm sorry. We don't have a choice. Edmund? Right now, I don't trust anyone. - No. What are you doing? - Quiet down, now. I have to do it. Edmund, I love you. I would never, ever steal from you. - You know that, right? - I don't have a choice. This is really out of line, Edmund. - You have... - Can you be quiet? Just... Quiet. Nothing. Edmund... Please. I need to go home. My dog is on its own. It has to be in the private wing. I'll search with a metal detector. That'll be the most efficient. Edmund. Come on. That's enough. Edmund, this is madness. You understand that, right? Utter madness. Everyone down to the lab. Now. Come on, no fooling around. Into the elevator! - I have to get home to my dog. - Could you shut up about the dog? Can we have our clothes back, at least? - Seriously... - It'll be over soon. I'll only keep you here for the rest of your lives. Or until one of you unlocks the door from the inside. You only have to punch in the new combination. - Eight magical digits. - Which are? That's the funny part. It's the same as for my office safe. I know... I know that one of you knows that combination. - What's so funny? - Nothing. I'm just impressed. It's quite the creative solution. I'll give him that. Creative? It's pretty serious, you know. Don't worry. Philip just has a slight tic issue whenever he gets stressed out. A slight issue? Why are you so stressed? Do you have anything to confess? Listen... We have to get to the bottom of this. One of you has stolen from the company. We need to find out who. But, seriously... It's obviously her. Little Miss Curls. What? No. - I know who you are. Everybody knows. - Who I am? You're sleeping with Edmund. Jesus Christ, I do have eyes, you know. - You just look innocent, but I know. - I've never slept with Edmund. Mm-hm. And I've never stolen any prototype. I don't even know what it looks like. And by the way... you're so convinced your husband is cheating on you, that gives you a motive for stealing from him. - That's a good point. - Oh, so, now we're listening to the bimbo? Come on. Edmund's own little personal assistant? Huh? Sounds like you're describing yourself. Forty years ago. You fucking... Can you just go and open that door? Just get us out of here. It wasn't me! Could you both please calm down? We need to solve this. It must have happened before we sat down to eat. Right? - So, did anyone see anything suspicious? - Yes, she snuck into Edmund's office. Shut up! You saw no such thing. - I can't take this anymore. - It's okay. Let me remind you, I'm the only one here with an owner's share in Alpha-Vita. I have no interest in sabotaging the company. - How about you? - What about me? Little Einstein that cracked the code that will make Edmund rich. Did he make you partner, like he promised? If anyone's got motive, it's you. You're just bitter because I solved it instead of you. That doesn't bother me at all. I've never begrudged you anything. Well, you were moping in your office last week. Saying you did the work, while he got the praise. It's true. Fine. - I'll admit I'm not Abdi's biggest fan. - Uh-huh. But listen here, he only got as far as he did because of my groundwork. Oh, please. I had to scrap everything and start over. All of your calculations were totally useless. Every single one of your theories was several years out of date. What the hell? Boys. Stop! Stop! Philip, what have you done? Abdi? Abdi! Abdi! I've checked everywhere. It has to be here. No windows or doors were opened. - Yes, I know, but... - But? Maybe they flushed it? Did you vet them thoroughly enough when you hired them? Yes, but only on Abdi and Oda. The others have been here since the beginning. Do it again. - Check them all. - Okay. - Your wife, as well? - Yes. Leave him. Fucking idiot. What if he dies? What if he dies, and he's the thief? Then you've killed our only chance of escaping. - Please stop. - It won't last long. We're going to die. He'll keep us here forever. No, no. It's just a tantrum. He'll calm down soon enough. Edmund would never harm four innocent people. Of course he would. He'd do anything for money. You know it's true, Margrethe. You survived the massacre of '99. What happened in '99? We lost a lot of money. We'd made some bad investments in Africa. We were on our last legs. It called for desperate measures. Edmund offered the staff a chance to buy shares in the company. Some invested their entire life's savings. Then he filed for bankruptcy. Then he started over again, six months later. He tricked his own employees into taking the fall. At least two committed suicide. Edmund didn't even attend their funerals. Jesus. Edmund isn't who you think he is. Look deep into his eyes, and all you'll see is pure, unadulterated greed. Edmund can be tough, but he's no monster. - He's generous, considerate. - Considerate? Oh. Is that why Margrethe has to remind him of his wife's birthday? She buys the presents, too. You know I'm right. To Edmund, we're all guinea pigs. Can't the guilty one just confess? We have to get out of here. We need to determine who has a motive. The bimbo was probably paid by Müller-Nova to steal the prototype. But that motive... That motive applies to all of us. Iselin, seriously, if anyone here cares about money, it's you. - Me? - Oh, please. Edmund is 15 years older than you, and not exactly George Clooney. Are you saying you married him for his personality? Yes. - Really? - Yes. To me, he is George Clooney. I love him, and he loves me. I've never cared about the money. - And still, he didn't trust you... - You shut up, now. Fuck. Braathen. Edmund. Take a look at this. - There has to be another way... - I'm bored of this. Confess, or I'll kill you all. No? Bill. Turn on the gas. Edmund, I... We can't do this. - Do it. Now. - But we can't... Edmund. In five minutes, you'll all be dead. Come back, Edmund! Edmund! Oh, God. Dear God. Eddie, get back here! Eddie! We're going to die. Oh, God. It's him. It was Abdi. We don't know that. We're going to die, and it's your fault. Abdi. Abdi, wake up. Edmund! Please... Please wake up. Abdi, please wake up. Wake up, please! Abdi, please. Come on, you have to wake up. Guys, look! We'll make five slips of paper, one each. We'll pass the pen around, and everyone writes down a combination. The thief writes the real one, then we mix all the slips together and try them all. Then we'll get out, without exposing the thief. No! I'll stand here and watch you die. Nobody steals from me. Edmund. Are you going to kill your own wife? Edmund. Edmund. Edmund! Darling? Darling. It's over. It was Arthur Müller, right? You couldn't get it out of the building, so you hid it. Where? Hmm? I have it figured out. When I went... to get it from the safe, you realized you were going to be exposed, right? So, you flushed it down the toilet. Am I close? Müller-Nova is just six months behind you, so, I thought maybe they would be happy if I... at least managed to destroy the prototype. But that's completely senseless! We'll make a new prototype. Müller-Nova will never catch us. Be thankful I care about you. I can't believe you did this, after all we've shared. For what, revenge? For your dad, who died 20 years ago? Yes, I found out who he was. Bill discovered that you took your adoptive parents' last name. That's why you weren't flagged on our end. You blame me for your father's suicide. But I didn't kill him. He made some poor investments and... - couldn't deal with the consequences. - No. You tricked him. You tricked your own employees. They gave you everything because they trusted you. Well, they shouldn't have. Will Iselin forgive you for almost killing her? Yes, of course. A couple expensive vacations, and I'm back to being George Clooney. Well, you're creative. Both before and after hours. But when it comes to our nightly adventures, I think Iselin is going to have a little more trouble forgiving those. Luckily, she doesn't have to find out. If we just forget what happened here tonight. Goodbye. Give my best to the great team at Müller-Nova. One last hug? You know what, Edmund, this isn't... It's necessary. Ah. You're smart. Oh, you are clever. Goddamn it, you've been clever tonight. But you're not the cleverest one here. Go to hell. Look! That little sneak had it all along. But, honey... it was just an act. It was never my intention to... - What? - Get in the cage. Iselin, I'm... I'm truly sorry. - Get in the cage. - Okay. Okay. We should take a deep breath, Iselin. Because... I... I'm sorry I... That I... That I let it go this far, but... But it... I... I'm sorry I took it this far. But it was needed. And you'll all agree, if you think about it. Now we'll... put this behind us. And we'll get together, and we'll think about the future. Hmm? Turn on the gas. Iselin. I love you. Hmm? - Do you? Really? - Yes. Good. I've changed the combination. Eight digits. My birthday. Day, month, year. It's easy. If you love someone, you know their birthday. Date. Shit. Fuck. Subtitle translation by Joseph Chavez
