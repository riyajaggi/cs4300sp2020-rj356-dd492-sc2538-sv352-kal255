 Rillington Place (2016): Season 1, Episode 1 - Ethel - full transcript 
 In 1941 Reg and Ethel Christie move into a dilapidated house in Notting Hill, 10, Rillington Place. Ethel is puzzled that Christie, a special constable, spends so many nights away from home but believes he is above being bribed for special perks. However she is irate to find him in pubs with other women but forgives him and refuses to leave him despite his domestic violence towards her. She still has her suspicions about his nocturnal activities, particularly when a female acquaintance goes missing. Seven years later the Christies welcome a young couple, Beryl and Timothy Evans as their lodgers at Rillington Place.

 I do solemnly declare that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. So help me God. You have the wrong person in here. I didn't do it. Timothy Evans, the jury finds you guilty... Come on! It wasn't me. Come on. I didn't do it! Timothy Evans, do you have any last words? Christie done it. It was Christie!

 Morning, Harry. Got something for me, have you? Letter for your sister. Thanks, Jack. Ta-ra. It's him. "My dearest Ethel, how happy I am that you've found me." "Shame that it was under these circumstances, but..." "had it not been, our paths may never have crossed again." "There's so much time to make up for." "So much to say." "I wish I had the courage to come back to you but I was embarrassed." "I've let you down." "And I knew you'd be better off without me." "I hope you can find it within yourself to forgive me. Reg." I thought you were dead.

 Nine years. Nine years without a word. Why didn't you write? I was ashamed. I'm sorry, love. Do you want a divorce? A divorce? Aye. Don't be daft. Do you know how I found you? Do you want to know? Every month for the past nine years... I wrote to Scotland Yard. Could they kindly inform me if a John Christie had befallen some tragedy? 100 letters, Reg. More. I should've sent for you. I should've. I shouldn't even be in here. I borrowed a car from a friend and it turned out to be stolen, so... Reg. I missed you. I missed you, love. Let's make a fresh start. There, there... Apparently, it's a very sought-after area. It's only temporary. A stepping stone. Come and see the garden. It needs a bit of love and care, no doubt. Spot of elbow grease. We'll do our own planting... if there's enough light. Still one sugar? Aye. Still one sugar. 'Can you see him? 'Yes. He's here. Just behind me. 'Here.' The end's not what I'd call cheerful. Well, he had to get his comeuppance, didn't he? It's a nice night. Aye. Wrong way, darlin'! Do you know her, Reg? Know her? She seemed to recognise you. I bet she says that to every chap that walks by. Here. You're definitely going the wrong way! Don't be shy. Wrong way, darling! Reg? Mark my words, you give him what he wants, it's the last you'll see of him. You're right. I am, aren't I, Ethel? I bet you saved yourself for Mr Christie? A LADY would never answer such a question. Girls. We've been unlucky but you'll always be my girl, Ethel. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Reg. There. Where did you get it? Don't ask, don't tell. Good girl, Judy. Come on, love. I've been made privy to some... confidential intelligence, Ethel. There's going to be heavy bombing tonight, so you get yourself to the shelter. What about you? I'm on duty. You will be careful, won't you? I'll be fine. Just you get yourself to the shelter. Night, love. Move along. That's it. Inside. Mind the steps. That's it. All the way down now. Thank you. Tuck your legs in. Tuck your knees in. That's it. Sorry. That's it, make a new friend. Snuggle up. Sorry. Move down here. Reg? Reg? I thought you were on duty? Enforced break. After 24 hours, it's mandatory. What's going on in there? The bedroom stinks of perfume. Judy - she left you a little present on the bed! You didn't have to use half the bottle, did you?! It's posh, that. Right. Did you miss me, Reg? Did you ever wonder what I were up to? 'Course. Was there ever anyone else? Ethel Christie! You know fine well you're my first and only. Come on, Reg, it was a long time. Too long. If there was, I'd understand. Close your eyes. What? Close your eyes. What for? Well, you'll not find out till you close them, so... Close your eyes. No peeking. I'm not. Open sesame! Reginald Christie, wherever did you get those? Go on, then! Reg. Reg! Reg? Reg? Reg? Someone tried to jimmy the window! Get back to bed! Come on. Um... Could I have a word? Um, Mrs Hodges has a birthday coming up. Sunday the 12th, to be precise, and, well, what with rationing and whatnot, I'm rather at a loss when it comes to a gift. Well, not knowing Mrs Hodges personally, I'm not sure I'm best placed to give you any advice... Everyone knows policemen can get all manner of things. You're thinking of soldiers, Mr Hodges. Only last week, my niece met a constable who gave her a whole box of chocolates. Em, I'm sorry, Mr Hodges, but, you see, I couldn't ask Reg. I just couldn't. You see, he's not that type of chap, you know? I don't mean to offend you, Mr Hodges, I'm sorry. No, no, not at all. Can I go now? Yes, yes. Yes, of course. Thank you. Goodnight. Goodnight. Ethel! It's Reg. Reg, what happened? I was... I was set upon right outside the station. Not a single bobby came to my aid. Not one. I've been the victim of a vicious slur, Ethel. The sergeant's wife is carrying on with another fellow behind his back. I ask you. I know who the real culprit is - it's the one who pointed the finger at me. But he's popular, see? He's, he's, he's one of the lads. He's turned the others against me. It's like the Post Office all over again. What do you mean by that? I mean you've been wrongly accused again. Well, they've had the best of me, but that's torn it. You're a natural policeman, everyone says so. They won't have a minute more of me, not a minute! Well, no need to make a decision now, just sleep on it? Let's get you off to bed? Come on. I'll not rest a minute, you know, with all your tossing and turning. Shall I keep you company? No, thanks. That would defeat the purpose. My back's been giving me trouble. So, it was a good night, then? I wouldn't say that. Barely got a wink. Probably too much excitement. Down at the Winchester. The Winchester? I don't know of any such place. I followed you. Right inside. I saw you talking to those two girls. One of them were playing with your hat, the hat I bought you. No, you were dreaming. You saw the state I was in yesterday. How could I have gone out in that condition? I saw you with my own two eyes. No, you didn't. It's impossible. I want you to see Dr Odess as a matter of urgency. Nine years. Nine years without a word. Nine years thinking you were dead! You're a dirty bastard, Reginald Christie. I don't want you touching me ever again. Do you understand? His mother, his grandmother and half his bloody uncles and aunts and then he says he's had a change of heart. A change of heart! They're all the same, I swear to God. You must know what men want, Ethel? Come on, how long have you been married? 15 years this March. 15 years! You must be doing something right! I'm here about Mr Christie. MR Christie? Aye. Since he finished with the police, he... He won't set foot outside the house, you know, he... He says he's too ill to even think about getting another job. He's taken on a strange mood as well, and, er... We never, never should have moved to London, really. I think that's what it is. We shouldn't have moved to London. Mrs Christie, London is not the culprit here. In my experience, every man needs an extra measure of care and attention as he... as he weathers the storms of middle age. "Care and attention"? From their wives, Mrs Christie. I couldn't care for Reg any more than I do... I just couldn't. That sounds a touch complacent, if you don't mind my saying so. As my old Latin teacher used to say, "Qui semper in melius locus" - "There's always room for improvement." Right, Doctor. Now, is there anything else? No. Do you fancy the pictures? I thought we could celebrate. Celebrate? What have we got to celebrate? I start a new job Monday. New job? I thought I'd surprise you. It is a surprise. I've met some smashing people, Ethel. I think you'll like them. Would I get an insurance payment if I killed you, Arthur? Well, we'd have to get married first. You won't find anyone to marry you now, although some say that James Doyle, of The Bull, used to be Father Doyle. He never was! Excommunicated after an incident involving the bishop's wife. You are funny, Reg! It's true. 'It won't be long now.' My dad says they've liberated Paris. We should switch the wireless on. Have you seen the wireless, Ethel? It's in the cupboard. I'll fetch it. Arthur, would you give us a hand? Where did you get that?? I made it myself. Clever bugger, aren't you? Arthur! I like to think so. My Reg can turn his hand to anything. Don't tell them at work, though, they'll have me on the shop floor! It needs an aerial, though. A coat hanger and a bit of wire. I could do it, if you, if you want? You won't know where anything is. I'll show you. How's your catarrh, Muriel? Rotten, I've been off two days with it. I trained as a doctor before the war. I didn't know that, Reg. Would you like me to take a quick peek? You're very pretty. A beauty. Thank you. Reg was telling me he trained to be a doctor. He does like to exaggerate. St John's Ambulance volunteer, wasn't it, Reg? Someone made a spectacle of themselves today. Embarrassed yourself good and proper. Never mind. We won't be seeing them again anyway. What makes you say that? I saw the way you looked at her, Reg. She's not one of the ones you pay for. Now, you give her a wide berth or I'll have a word! You keep a wide berth or I'll tell her exactly what respectable Mr Christie gets up to... Ring his bloody neck. Bastard! Er, Ethel, you've a letter. Excuse me. Ethel. Ethel! What rubbish is he spouting? It's a long letter, Ethel, to be saying nothing. He's, er, he's sick is all. He's not well. What kind of excuse is that? I don't know. He must think you're daft. Aye. Listen, I've been thinking, Harry, you know. I'm happy you've met Janice. You don't need me here anymore. I'm going to go home. He nearly bloody killed you. The problem is, Harry, he's not well. You know he's not been right. He's not been right ever since I lost the baby. That was years ago. I think it's London, as well. It's a horrible, horrible place. You know, I think... I just need to go home and make it right. Aye. You'll be all right. Got to start a family now. I've plenty of time for that. I've got to look after the one I've got. I'll be all right. Would you take me home, please? I need to go home. I need to make it right. Aye. Ethel? I didn't think you were coming back. Harry. Reg. They begged me to stay, Harry. Sergeant Thomas - Taffy, we called him - he said I was an "asset to the force". Did he now? Yes, he did. Right, I best be off. Don't want to miss my train. No, no, you don't. Harry, I've got something for you. Shall I fetch it? You won't know where it is. Right. Ethel? Ethel? Happy Christmas. Well, it's an early Christmas present. Are you all right? Aye. You don't want to miss your train. Come on. Are you sure you won't come back with me? No, Harry, I'm sure. I'll be all right. Come on, you're going to miss your train. Love you. I love you. Go on. Be nice to get things back to normal. Bit of a mess in there, isn't it? If only I'd known... I wanted to get things shipshape before you came back, then you went and surprised me. It's a nice surprise, I must say. I've been hopeless without you, Ethel. Got myself into all kinds of bother. Thought I was losing my mind. Even Dr Odess was worried. "What ails you, Mr Christie?", he asked. "Mrs Christie", I told him... "and the absence thereof." It's all fine now, though... now that you're back. Now that the lady of the house has returned. Home and dry, that's what we are, Ethel. Home and dry. Sit down. You put your feet up. I'll get the bedroom sorted, tidied up. Shipshape. Nice cup of tea. Was that the door? Not expecting anyone? Arthur. Sorry to bother you, Mr Christie. Have either of you seen Muriel? She was supposed to meet me hours ago. Well, I haven't seen her since last time you were here. She said something about coming to see you. Me? Something about her catarrh. Well, she must have changed her mind. I don't know what to do, no-one's seen her since last night. Well, Muriel lives by Croydon, doesn't she? Yeah, what of it? Well, well, there's been a lot of flying bombs in that vicinity. The wireless has been full of it. God, don't say that. Come on. We'll find her. Hang on, that... that looks like Muriel's coat. It's mine. I liked Muriel's so much, I bought one for myself. Come on. Thank you, Mr Christie. It's the least I can do. I'll help you. Here we are. Are you sure? Hold my hand, come on, come here. Get down before you do yourself an injury. Well, you've got to show me. Sh, there's someone living down there. And... open. Well, it's a bit dark. Dark?! No, there's windows. No, you're right. It's a fresh start. It will be nice. Right, so which one's ours? Upstairs. Well, what you waiting for? Christmas? Is she pretty, Reg? Cheeky Beryl. Get up there. Hard to say from this angle. Well, you keep your bloody hands to yourself. Do you hear me? Show me. Get yourself up them stairs. Get off! We're not long married, Mr Christie. Could do with some privacy. We've never had a place of our own so it'll be nice to know you're keeping an eye out. Women need to be handled with care, Tim. I just wanted to say thanks - Mr Christie said you'd talked some sense into her. Your Beryl - she was seen, Tim. If I catch you out with another bloke... What do I need another bloke for? Did you follow me home, Mr Christie? You've been telling us lies all this time. Come on, Tim, what have you done?
