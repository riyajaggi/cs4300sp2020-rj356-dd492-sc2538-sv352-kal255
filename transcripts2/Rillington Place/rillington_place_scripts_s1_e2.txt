 Rillington Place (2016): Season 1, Episode 2 - Tim - full transcript 
 Loved-up newly-weds Beryl and Tim Evans move into 10, Rillington Place and are given house rules, including to keep out of the back yard. They have a baby, Geraldine, but Christie plays on their financial woes and plants suspicion of his wife's infidelity in Evans' mind. So, when Beryl falls pregnant again Christie, claiming medical experience, offers to perform a termination - with fatal results. Afterwards he persuades the simple young widower that they should dispose of her body, lying about her whereabouts. Too naïve and trusting to appreciate that he has been led into a trap by Christie Evans finds himself being arrested for killing his wife and child.

 It's only temporary - a stepping stone. We've been unlucky... You'll always be my girl. I thought you were on duty. Enforced break. After 24 hours it's mandatory. I saw you with me own two eyes. I don't want you touching me ever again. I met some smashing people, Ethel. I think you'll like them.

 You're very pretty. Reg was telling me he trained to be a doctor. I saw the way you looked at her, Reg. She's not one of the ones you pay for. You keep a wide berth or I'll... I'll ring his bloody neck. I haven't seen her since the last time you were here. She said something about coming to see you. That looks like Muriel's coat. It's mine. Is she pretty, Reg? Hard to say from this angle. Well, you keep your bloody hands to yourself. This programme contains some scenes which some viewers may find upsetting.

 You're back again, are you? Yes, Mr Christie. We are. Check in here. Check the next room. Two men round there. And check the cellar. Guv, round here. Whoo! Woo! Careful! See how thin these walls are, Beryl? I'll need to see about that. What are you doing? We don't want all and sundry knowing our business, do we? And what've we got to hide? It's a good job we won't be here long. Tim. Tim! What?! What? What've we got here, then? Two careful owners, just a few miles on the clock... Bodywork's in need of a bit of polish... Full service, was it? Come here. Tim. Tim Evans. Windsor. Windsor? Well, last time I was up Windsor was a job for the castle. They see the van, mistake me for a groundsman. The next thing, they're on about a bulge in the turf that's interfering with the King's croquet. So, I went over, flattened it with the sole of my shoe. He was so pleased, he gave me his ball. And his bat. Mallet. You what? You play croquet with a mallet, Tim. Get a move on, Evans. All right, Adler. I'm all right. Er, are you after something? Just thought I'd go over a few house rules. Reginald Christie. Been on the ground floor for ten years now. I'm Beryl... Good evening, Mrs...? Evans. We're not long married, Mr Christie. Could do with some privacy. You'll have no concerns on that front. I was in the police force, decorated, in fact. Left due to injuries sustained in the Great War. I was a doctor on the front. A doctor? My uncle's a doctor. Yeah, travels the world, he does - healing the sick, stitching up heads, princes and all sorts. What's his name? It's a big world, I doubt you'd know 'im. Er... so... Er... It's a bit on the small side, isn't it? The print, I mean. I'll summarise, if I may. "Visitors should be kept to a minimum." "None after ten o'clock of the evening..." "Use of the lavatory is restricted to seven in the morning" "till ten at night..." "Unfortunately, there'll be no use of the back yard..." No use at all? Exclusive domain of the ground-floor flat, I'm afraid. Well, we're on the list for a new-build, Mr Christie. Inside WC. That's a touch unhygienic for me, I'm afraid. Well, we'll not be here long. Well, rules are rules - the length of tenure is irrelevant. Well, thanks ever so much, Mr Christie. We've never had a place on our own, so it'll be nice to know you're keeping an eye out. Won't it, Tim? Yeah, I suppose so. You'll have no trouble from us, Mr Christie, I promise. Mrs Christie? Tim. Can you listen out for Geraldine? Beryl's not back yet. Has she been fed? Only, I've got Mr Christie's tea to make. Yeah. She'll be off in no time. Tim?? It's Friday, Tim. Is it? The rent man. Tell him I'll see him next week. Reg told him that last week. And he says you're a month in arrears... I'll sort it, Mrs Christie, don't worry, yeah. Right... See you. 'Billy's Dance is 50-1 - the rank outsider - and your. 'Dad's got his wages on him. 'Now it's the second-to-last lap. 'The rider slips his stirrup. Billy stumbles. 'But he keeps coming, hoofing the hard ground - ' squeezing past at the finish to take the race. The crowd go wild! I go wild. I swear to God, as he crosses the line, that horse looks up at me and... smiles. Just like you. Well, then, let's get you to bed. There we go. Stay there. Hiya. Where the hell have you been? Come on, what you waiting for? Where have you been?... It wasn't my fault, it was the girls. The girls? Which girls? Evening. He never lets me out. Not since I've had the baby. Did you follow me home, Mr Christie? No, no, no, I was just on my way back, as it happens. Beryl...? Tim, I was wondering if we could have a little talk? Do you want to go and see to Geraldine? Go on, she's been waiting all night for you. That's it. Come on. That's it. There's no easy way to say this, Tim... Well, say it quick cos I need to get to bed. It's... probably not as bad as it looks. What do you mean? Your Beryl. She was seen, Tim. If you're worried, I could ask. Mrs Christie to have a little word with her... She knows what it means to be a wife, Tim. Yeah, well, thanks, Mr Christie. That'd be nice of her. Goodnight, Tim. If I catch you out with another bloke... I already told you, it wasn't me. What do I need ANOTHER bloke for? I don't want you going out with that Lucy Endecott again. She's clever - Lucy. Clever? Yeah. She doesn't rush into things... Beryl... Beryl. You've got responsibilities now. Where you going? Who was it said they saw me? And your uncle's isn't a doctor - he works down the garage. Beryl! Morning, Beryl. Sorry about the noise last night, Mrs Christie. That's all right, love, I thought you were a burglar, coming in at that hour. I just wanted to say thanks. To you and Mr Christie. It's no bother, she's a sweet baby. No, no, I mean about Beryl. Beryl? Yeah, Mr Christie said you'd talk some sense into her. How's the patient this morning? Sore head? Tim was just telling me about Beryl. If it's no bother, Mrs Christie...? No, it's no bother. We'll have her match-fit in no time. Won't we, Ethel? > See you upstairs, Ted. About bloody time. Sorry, boss. Well, you're here now. Paddington Basin. Just as I've shown you. Beryl. Mrs Christie. What's...? Who's put that there? Tim. I've replaced it, so... On loan, as it were. Well, thanks, Mr Christie. That's kind of you. And your lights went out, so I popped a couple of shillings in the meter. Well, I haven't got anything.. No. No... As and when you can. All right, Mum? What are you after? What? Couple o' bob. It's the baby. You know what she's like, she doesn't stop eating. It's just till the weekend. It is the weekend. It's Beryl, Mum. I give her five pound a week and she still can't make ends meet... She got a new pair of shoes just the other day! She's had it hard, your Beryl... No mother, no schooling, no church. She's doing a fine job, all things considered. Well, you're not married to her. And you're not having another penny off me till you stop bad-mouthing her. All right. See you. What's going on? What? I'm not having any more? Any more? How long have you known? Doesn't matter, I'm not keeping it. Why didn't you tell me? What's wrong with you? We're married. It's what married people do. You think you're too good for this, don't you? You think you're too good for me. What is it you want, Beryl? You waiting for something special or what? You get rid of it, you'll have rid of me. All right, then... Yes! Here he is. Not for much longer. New job! De Havilland's, isn't it? That's right. First thing Monday, I'm on a plane to Europe. Europe? Whereabouts in Europe? They weren't specific. Hadn't you better find out? I tell you what, it's over. We're finished - and I'll tell you something - it's the best day of my life. There's a girl at work who's caught my eye. 18. Stunner, know what I mean? 'A real looker, you know. 'But here's the bit I never would've guessed - you see, her dad 'owns the company, so she's, you know, 'what she is, she's one of those...' Go on, son, top it up. Go on, son. 'That's it!' What does he look like? Yeah. Tim... Left the baby, have you? Mrs Christie's looking after her. Where have you been, who've you been out with? Just Lucy. Just Lucy! Come here, I'll give you a good bloody hiding! Get off me! Come here! Get off me! You're a liar, Tim Evans. You've got no job with de Havilland's - I spoke to them this morning - they've never even heard of you! Yeah? Who told you that? Come here. Where you going to go? Come here. You're a liar. You're a liar. Admit it! Shut up. Shut Up! Lies and make-believe. And you wonder why I don't want another one? Shut up! One more word... One more word... Come on. That's enough! It's that brother of yours. Accusing me about that bloody watch. His own brother-in-law. That's why I can't get a better job. You deserve everything you got. I'm sorry. Why do you feel you have to lie, Tim? The job - just admit you made it up. All right. I haven't got a job with de Havilland's. It's... It's all stories. All of it. Are you happy? Don't go. It'll be all right, Tim. I'm not a bad 'un, am I, Mr Christie? No. Well, that's what she thinks! No, no. Women need to be handled with care, Tim. Whenever Mrs Christie isn't feeling herself, I find that a small act of kindness does the trick. You'll be all right, Tim. You'll be all right. Cup of tea? You come in when you're ready. Tim. I've been informed that the builders will be starting work on the front of the house today. I thought you should know. Thanks, Mr Christie. And, er, I suggest that you keep your valuables under lock and key. Mr Christie...? That's nice, it's, er, it's new, is it? Yeah, belongs to a friend. Keeping it for his aunt. Is that right? Fit for a king, isn't it, Beryl? It's very nice. Second one's easier, love, trust me. Look at that. Be careful you don't scratch it! I'll keep an eye. I'd be a surgeon now - if it wasn't for the war... Yeah. Is, er, is everything all right, Mr Christie? I'll come right to the point, Tim... Ethel and I are worried. About what? Your Beryl. She's intent on getting rid of the baby. The method that she's entertaining, it-it, it won't work. There might be consequences. What are you talking about? The establishment that she means to visit, off Praed Street, it's... In my policing days I witnessed some terrible scenes down there. But she's having it... The baby. She's having it, Mr Christie. Women know their own minds, Tim, and their bodies. If your Beryl wants to wait a few years, perhaps it's for the best. Now... I have helped couples in... similar situations... Tim. What is it? It's all about the human body. Male and female. What does it say? It's very technical. The thing is, Tim, I'm worried about what she might do to herself... I mean, think of Geraldine. Geraldine? She'll not do anything to Geraldine. Well, if you do come to a meeting of minds, my method is very safe. W-What is this... method...? Well, the laws of medical confidentiality prohibit me from going into details, Tim. Suffice to say, that not every Tom, Dick and Harry can be made privy to the procedure, for obvious reasons. You do trust me, don't you, Tim? Yeah, of course, of course I do, Mr Christie, yeah... Well, it's the lesser of two evils. You can't knowingly... bring an unwanted child into the world, Tim. You said, it's, um, very safe...? Well... It's not without risk, Tim... I must say. You don't have to decide now. I do and I have - goodnight, Mr Christie. Goodnight. I need to go back to work, Tim. Work? You know, Mr Christie says... I know what Mr Christie says. Then what are you so worried about? What's wrong with you? Why don't you want it? He's trained as a doctor, Tim. I trust him. We can wait a bit. Save some money. Do it properly next time. Maybe even wait for the new house? You've just got to tell Mr Christie. "Everything's all right." Don't forget to tell Mr Christie. Morning, Tim. Everything's all right. Tim... Bad news, I'm afraid. What, about Beryl? I'm very sorry. You go on up... I'll be just behind you. I put her in with the baby. Beryl? Beryl. Dear, dear, dear. What's the blood from, Mr Christie? How long has she been lying here? About three o'clock... Tim. There was nothing I could do. Her stomach was septic. Another day, she'd... She'd've been in the hospital. What did you do to her? Nothing unorthodox, Tim. The same method any doctor would apply. Just what you asked for. Here, you, you leave everything to me. I'll iron everything out. Come on. Now, as hard as it is to contemplate, Tim... we must dispose of the body. I can dispose of her... down the drain. The drain...? Sit down, Tim. Otherwise, the-the police will, will have to be involved. Well, I didn't do nothing. Yes, but they don't know that, do they? I mean... Think of how it'll look to them... You've been rowing with Beryl a lot lately. Likely as not, they'll jump to the wrong conclusion. They'll think you killed her. You could hang for this. Hang? Well, I-I I'd better take the baby to Mum's. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. That'll just attract attention, you see. If anyone asks, just say... Beryl's gone away. Wh-what about Geraldine? Will... Mrs Christie watch her? No. No. No. She's got work, Tim. Same as you. I tell you what, I do know of a very nice couple in Acton who've not managed to have a baby of their own. I'm sure they'd jump at the chance to look after her. I'll, I'll feed her today, and then I'll pop round and... see what they say. How's that sound? Thanks, Mr Christie. Thanks. Dear, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. You're going on a holiday, Geraldine. An adventure. A nice big house with a garden... Animals, everything you want. I promise to come and see you soon, as soon as I get everything ironed out. Might even take you to the races. Come on. Oh, Tim. I know, I know, it's... It's hard, Tim. I thought you should have these, Tim. You get set up properly. You can send for the baby. If anyone comes round asking questions, they'll know to trust me. They're a lovely couple. Lovely couple, Tim. She'll be in safe hands. Don't you worry... Shall I? I know. I know. Shh, shh. Thanks, Mr Christie. 'I was coming off to Cardiff and the car broke down, 'and I thought I'd pop in.' 'Come in, son, come in!' Vi. Vi. Look who it is. Hello, Auntie Vi. Hello, lovely boy! Mwah! How are you? Well... is Beryl and the baby with you? No, she's, er, gone to Brighton for a holiday. Stay with her dad. Well, will you go and join them? Well, once the car's fixed, I'll have to get straight back to work, won't I? How long did they say they'd be with the car? Couple of days, I'd imagine, no longer. Come and sit down. I'll make you a cup of tea. Thank you. Not much changed in here, is there? No. All right, bud? Broke again, is it? Yes, it is. Tea, boys? There you go. Tim? Thanks, Auntie Vi. She'll be missing you. I'll have to bring her back a present, won't I? Something special. Afternoon. Sit down, Tim. We've had a letter... From your mother. Yeah. What does she have to say for herself? "Well, Vi, I don't know what lies Tim have told you down there." "I know nothing about him, as I have not seen him for three weeks." "And I have not seen Beryl or the baby for a month..." Well, that's a load of rubbish, innit? "His name stinks up here, everywhere I go - people asking for him" "for money he owes them, I am ashamed to say he's my son..." And Beryl's dad's not seen them neither. The truth is... The truth is Beryl... She left me and the baby. Went off with another man. Your Beryl? Yeah. Well, what about the baby? I-I took her to some good Welsh people I know in London. Come on!! Newport folk who couldn't have a baby of their own. I-I gave them some money, so she'd be fine for a while. Why didn't you just take her to your mother's? Because she's too busy with work, isn't she? Why didn't you bring the baby to me? Well, I didn't think about that, Aunt Vi, did I?! You've been telling us lies all this time. No. I haven't, I haven't, I swear. I swear to you. You have, Tim. I think it's time that... you were on your way. OK. Thank you. What time's the train? Think they're on the hour. Plenty of time, then. Will you, er, tell Aunt Vi I'm sorry? If you sort things out, Tim. 'About the beginning of October... 'my wife, Beryl Susan Evans...' told me she was expecting a baby... She then said she was going to get rid of it. She started... syringing herself and taking tablets and... She was making herself ill. I told her she was being silly. I said, "What difference will one more make?" You know? A few days later, I was stopped at a transport cafe, somewhere between Ipswich and Colchester, I can't really remember where exactly, but... And I got talking to a stranger. He saw I was in a state and asked why? I explained. And he gave me a bottle wrapped in brown paper. He said it would do the trick. Beryl found it in my pocket, while she was looking for a cigarette. I told her what it was and not to take it. When I got home that night, all the lights were out. She was just... laying there on the bed, not moving. I spoke to her but she didn't answer. She was... She wasn't breathing. Um... I, er, then... I then waited till about one in the morning... and I took her down the stairs and out the front door. Then disposed of her down the drain. It took three officers to lift the lid of the manhole outside 10 Rillington Place last night... There's nothing in there. Why would you lie about a thing like that? Erm... I... I said that to protect a man named Christie. The only thing that's not true is the part about meeting a man in a cafe and disposing of my wife's body. All the rest is true. John Christie lives on the ground floor. He said he could get rid of the baby without no risk. That's what he said. Can you, um, can you get a message to my mum? Ask her to, to go and see Christie and get the address in Acton where the baby is staying. Tell her to go and see her. I-I need you to get the address. W-Where the baby's staying, so then we can pick her up and... And you can... And you'd understand. Mr Evans... They found the bodies. Your wife... and your daughter. No, no. That's impossible. I know you're a liar. You strangled Beryl. You strangled her with a piece of rope from your van. No. You strangled your wife! And then what happened? Tell me what you did. What happened? What did you do? ♪ My Bonnie lies over the ocean ♪ Bring back my Bonnie to me ♪ Bring back Bring back ♪ Bring back my Bonnie to me ♪ Bring back Bring back ♪ Bring back my Bonnie to me. ♪ Come on, Tim. You strangled her. You strangled her with a...? With... Come on, Tim. With a piece of rope from my van. And then what happened? What? You waited till the Christies had gone to bed, and then...? Then... I took her... I took her down the stairs and to the wash house. Tim... what have you done? I never done it, Mum. Christie done it. I promise. Tell Christie I want to see him. He's the only one who can help me now. I went to see him last night. Yeah? He wouldn't let me in. Why? He got the police on me. This way, Mr Christie. No. He knows. I need to speak to him. Sit yourself down. I need to see him. He knows, he knows. He's the one who knows. I need to speak to him. Tim! Christie's the one saying you done it. We'll be as quick as we can, Mr Christie. Glad to hear it. I do solemnly declare that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me, God. Mr Christie, you are, are you not, a man of good character? I'm unfit to testify, Dr Odess. Mr Christie - you would really need to be gravely ill. She was fine when I left her. Before you know it, he was saying I killed her. You come back later, you can have a coat or two, if you like. Thanks, Mr Christie. You're invisible down here. Creeping out at night. Well, I won't keep your dirty secrets a day longer, do you hear me? You need to lie down, Ethel. Mr Timothy Evans' sole line of defence rests on attacking you... a perfectly innocent man.
