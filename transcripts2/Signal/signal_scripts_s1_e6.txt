 Exactly what happened that day? We were wrong. No, no... I was... I did everything wrong. Everything... is ruined because of me. These transmissions... should never have started. What are you saying? Here. Was it him? Hold on. Actually, it wasn't him. It was this person.

 This person? Yes, that's the guy. Really? He really said it was Oh Kyung Tae? Yeah, that's right. I looked for fingerprints where you told me to, Detective Lee. I found some prints on Han Suk Hee's mailbox. [FINGERPRINT TEST RESULTS] [SAMPLE 1 AND SAMPLE 2, 99.98 PERCENT MATCH] Why are you doing this? Why did you lie? Lie about what? It's not me! A witness came forward and identified you. Your fingerprints were found at that house. None of that is what happened. Your car... Where did you get the money? Do you really not trust me at all? I bought that for Eun Ji's future. You think I'd buy that with stolen money? What are you doing here? Dad really didn't do it. Let's go in quietly. I'm telling you that Dad really didn't do it. Detective Lee, let me just take Eun Ji home. Then I'll go in on my own, okay? There are probably detectives waiting for you at home. Come with me. Eun Ji, go home and wait for me. You trust your dad, right? I'll be back soon so go home. Let's go. If both you and Mom diet, am I supposed to starve? Should I also eat vegetables all the time? Come on. Let's get on. Hurry up and get on. You were with your daughter during the Hanyoung Bridge accident? Yes, I was there with my daughter. But what does that have to do with my daughter's kidnapping? I looked into Oh Kyung Tae's personal information. Oh Kyung Tae's daughter also died from the Hanyoung Bridge accident. And what of it? Many people died from that accident. He may have taken your daughter to demand a ransom. We should still look into all other possibilities. It helps us to know more about your daughter. Yeo Jin came back from the brink of death back then. She has suffered ever since that incident. It was a horrible day, and we wanted to forget it. Okay. Keep your composure. Wait. Slowly, slowly. Hello. Dad... Dad? Yeo Jin! Where are you? Are you okay? You're not hurt? What's going on? We narrowed down the ares that Shin Yeo Jin would likely be in. It's very likely that she's in one of these areas. The victim has made contact. Her cell phone is turned on. What? Is she okay? Are you alone? Are you okay? I am... alone. Dad... I'm so cold. Shin Yeo Jin. Please keep calm and listen to me. I'm Cha Soo Hyun of the Seoul Metropolitan Police. What do you see in your surroundings? It's a car. I'm inside a car. Are you inside a trunk? No. It's very big. How about windows? There are no windows. Everything is closed off. It's just so cold. It's a truck. A refrigerated truck. Yeo Jin! What about GPS location? It's within three kilometers of here. If it's within three kilometers, that is this area here. Look through every refrigerated truck in this area. Okay, I got it. Refrigerated trucks! Let's go. Everyone get going except one. Detective Park, you stay behind. - Okay. - What are you doing? Get going. Isn't this strange? Why would he leave the phone behind for Shin Yeo Jin? He could have dropped it by mistake. That happens a lot. I heard that Oh Kyung Tae was very detailed. We confirmed that it was Shin Yeo Jin. It was definitely her that called. We have to save the victim's life first and foremost. Detective Choi, get ready to go. [PARK HAE YOUNG] - It's me. - Shin Yeo Jin is not the target. What do you mean? Oh Kyung Tae and Shin Dong Woon's daughters were both in the Hanyoung Bridge accident. - I know. - It wasn't just a normal accident. Oh Kyung Tae's daughter could have been saved. Yeo Jin... Yeo Jin! Yeo Jin, Yeo Jin! Yeo Jin, Yeo Jin! Yeo Jin! Yeo Jin. Yeo Jin! Hey, hey! Are you all right? Hey! No, no, no, no... No, no, no! No... Eun Ji! Eun Ji. What's going on? Eun Ji. Hey! Hey, Eun Ji! Eun Ji! Please help me! Save my daughter, please! You have to save my daughter here. My daughter is in there. Hey, bring that over here. My daughter is in there. Save her. - Someone needs help here. - Eun Ji! Eun Ji! - Hey, check the chart. - Yes, sir. Is her leg stuck? Isn't this the smell of gas? - Please help her over here! - Bring the hydraulic jack now! - Eun Ji! - Why is there only one? We only have one right now. When will the second jack get here? Hold on just a bit, Eun Ji. I'll get to you soon. There are two female students stuck in the bus. The gas is leaking. We have no time! Send it over as soon as possible. The childrens' lives are in danger! - Just pick one. - You have to save one of them. What if there is an explosion? We could get hurt if there is a spark. We must decide now. Eun Ji! Are you going to take responsibility if my daughter dies? Do it quick! Now! Set it up on this side. No! Eun Ji! Eun Ji. Hurry. Eun Ji, Eun Ji! Eun Ji! We have to hurry up. No, you can't! You have to move fast. It's dangerous! You can't! No. No! No, Eun Ji... Eun Ji! No... No, no! Eun Ji. Eun Ji... Eun Ji! Oh Kyung Tae believes that Shin Dong Woon killed his daughter. How did you find that out? Who told you? I heard from a witness who saw the accident himself. Who is this witness? That's not the important part. Oh Kyung Tae's past crimes were meticulous and efficient. If he wanted to kill Shin Yeo Jin, who lived instead of his daughter he would have killed her on the spot, not abducted her. Since that's more efficient. But he took her, and even exposed himself. Just like he couldn't do anything to save his own dying daughter he's doing the same thing to Shin Dong Woon. Shin Yeo Jin is just the bait. Oh Kyung Tae's true target is Shin Dong Woon. Shin Yeo Jin is likely somewhere near Hanyoung Bridge. The kidnapping was triggered by a long-standing resentment. It makes sense to return to a symbolic place. Hello? Detective Cha? He didn't drop her phone. He left it there on purpose. In order to fool us. You don't see Shin Dong Woon? He was here just a minute ago. But... gosh. It's my fault. Oh Kyung Tae... was not the culprit. What do you mean? Hey! Yeah? Hey, what's your problem? I heard there were no prints. I heard you only found partial prints. I heard you couldn't even verify whose they were. I had a witness. The witness only got a passing glance at night. If there were no prints, I wouldn't have to arrest him! What do you expect me to do? The bosses wanted us to catch the guy! You must be completely crazy. Hey, we had a witness. He said it was Oh Kyung Tae for sure. I'm going to reveal everything! Oh Kyung Tae's been convicted already. No one within the police is going to believe you. It's your fault. It's your fault, you bastard! If you hadn't arrested me... If I had been by her side, I could have saved her life. It's all your fault! You were right about what you said. This case... It should have remained unsolved. I should have left it alone. Fine the real culprit. We ruined everything, so we have to put things back in place. If you can find who did it now, you can make things right. It's my fault. I have to stop it. Shin Dong Woon's cell phone turned off. We can't locate him. Why do you need to? Shin Dong Woon has disappeared. Get me some backup. How can I ask for backup when I don't know where he is? - He's likely near Hanyoung Bridge. - Are you sure? Get me backup in the Hanyoung Bridge area. Hanyoung Bridge at 12:00 a.m. If you bring the police, the temperature goes to minus 50 Celsius. Then you're daughter will die. If you want to save your daughter, you make the decision. Where is my Yeo Jin? Where is she? How does it feel seeing your daughter dying? Why are you doing this this us? Why? You did it too. Right here on the Hanyoung Bridge. Are you going to take responsibility if my daughter dies? I want you too see exactly how it feels. Your daughter is dying... That feeling of being completely helpless... What are you talking about? I was watching rats dying in the truck. I set it for minus 20 degree Celsius. It hadn't even been five minutes and they froze to death. A rat takes five minutes to die. How long do you think a person can last? Please. Please let my daughter live. I was in the wrong. Just let my daughter live, please. Please! This isn't the time for that. You should go save your daughter, shouldn't you? It has to be around here somewhere. Oh Kyung Tae, where is Shin Yeo Jin? Where is Shin Yeo Jin? Eun Ji. You've waited a long time, haven't you? [PARK HAE YOUNG] Did you find it? There's a truck in front of the Memorial Tower at south end of Hanyoung Bridge. Yeo Jin, Yeo Jin! It's Dad. Open up, Yeo Jin! Yeo Jin! Yeo Jin, answer me! Oh Kyung Tae. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to legal counsel. It's too short. Compared to my 20 years. It's too short for you. He tried to escape a few times, but he failed. He was quiet after that. He learned some electronics skills too, and didn't cause trouble. Police! Step aside. It's locked and it won't open. There's no answer either. Yeo Jin. Electronic skills... The refrigeration in the trucks uses liquid petroleum gas. That's why he learned the electronic skills. He's going to use it kill him with fire just like his daughter. Yeo Jin! Please move. It's dangerous. Yeo Jin. - Yeo Jin. - Move back. Don't come any closer. Yeo Jin. Yeo Jin. Detective Cha, you can't! She's here. She's here. We found her! No! Move! No! What is this about? What are you saying happened to Soo Hyun? It's not true, right? Right? It's not true, is it? Is it? I'm sorry. What are you trying to say... Where's my Soo Hyun? Mom. Soo Hyun! Soo Hyun, your mom is here! Soo Hyun, Mom is here. Soo Hyun... Mom is here. Soo Hyun, come here. Soo Hyun! Soo Hyun, come to Mom. Soo Hyun! Soo Hyun. We were wrong. No, no... I was... I did everything wrong. Open the door. Open the door for me. "Each pair of handcuffs comes with 2.5 liters of tears." Isn't Batman too much? Lieutenant Park Hae Young, who hates cops and has dignity... You're not suited to be a cop. Don't give me just anyone, give me someone good. What's with you? Are you really going to give up like this? No, I'm going to catch the killer. I told him to do it. If I'm choosy about facing men or women... I need to turn in my badge now. What is this? It's called team work. It's your first time seeing a dead person, isn't it? Find something to help you deal with it. You were right about what you said. This case... It should have remained unsolved. I should have left it alone. Fine the real culprit. We ruined everything, so we have to put things back in place. If you can find who did it now, you can make things right. If we can find who really did it... I can change the future. Everyone already did what they can. Why are you digging up a case that's done? This is the first place we staked out, right? This is the place where you all grabbed me. Which path did you run through? Okay, so this is the playground here. - Yes. - We went past the playground. You went past the playground, right? Then no one went over here towards the mountains on the night of September 10th? They would be in big trouble if they did. There are army soldiers over there. You're sure you were staked out here? Yes, we were. You weren't looking away somewhere or off pooing? What? No. I have constipation. Constipation? You must be suffering a lot. Over there! That way! Task Force Team 1 ran southeast towards the bus station. Task Force Team 2 ran west towards the houses. Precinct Team 1 went towards the playground in the south. Precinct Team 2 went towards the school in the southwest. We got him. Got him! There are no escape routes. Detective, you were in the Task Force Squad before, right? Can I ask you some questions regarding the larceny case... Move. What are you doing? Oh, the admin team on the third floor needs a desk. We also need to get her stuff to her family. Tell them to use another desk. You can't take this one. But I was told by the bosses to take care of it quickly. Who? Who told you that? I did. We're civil servants that get paid with taxes. And that desk is paid for by the citizens. You can't leave it there like that forever. The cold case squad team has experienced a setback. But we will continue on like this for now. It might be difficult, but hang on for just a bit. It's a team that'll be gone soon anyway. Is this how it usually is? Is this how cops usually are? She was a co-worker that you worked with until just yesterday. How could you do this? We need to give her a proper send-off. How could you act like this? What right do you have to be yelling? When Cha Soo Hyun was dying... it was you who couldn't do anything, despite being by her side. Kim Gye Chul, what are you doing? Take charge and get it taken care of now. Park Hae Young. What do you do on this team? You may not qualify as a profiler yet but you're still a profiler. While I'm the center of Seoul wrestling with evidence and witnesses you have to looking down on me from the moon like Armstrong on Apollo 11. Whether it's the evidence, witness, or case see them all as one point far in the distance. You can't ever let emotions cloud your view. [MYSTERIOUS THIEF ENTERS CEO'S HOME, POLICE INVESTIGATING] A point far in the distance... [BURGLARY OF HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS, STILL UNSOLVED] Don't let emotions cloud my view. First burglary was on September 2, 1995. CEO Kang Sang Moon's home. Unable to determine entry and exit. Second was CEO Ko Jae Myung's home. Stolen goods, unconfirmed. Third was Congressman Jang Young Chul. Home was empty as he was attending a book publishing party. Fourth was Prosecutor Han Suk Hee. Except for the son the house was empty, as they were visiting relatives. I have no pictures of the crime scene or files on the investigation. But somewhere... there is a lead. Evidence that points to Oh Kyung Tae. Partial print on the mailbox and his ability to open safes. The testimony of the witness, Han Sae Kyu. The transmissions will come again. I have to find something before then. Evidence, witness, and case. Like a dot far off in the distance. Don't let emotions cloud my view. I don't have enough information. There's a limit to profiling when using newspaper articles. You're still on this case? You should give it a rest. Who threw something like this in the garbage? [1995 BURGLARY OF HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS' HOMES] [NO CRIME SCENE PHOTOS. NO FINGERPRINT MATCHES.] [KANG SEOK HO] [KO JIN WOO] [JANG KI JOO] [HAN SE KYU] The investigations... [WITNESS TESTIMONY - HAN SAE KYU] Taeyoung High School... Taeyoung Junior High... [KANG SEOK HO - TAEYOUNG HIGH SCHOOL TAEYOUNG JUNIOR HIGH] [KO JIN WOO - TAEYOUNG JUNIOR HIGH] [JANG KI JOO - TAEYOUNG HIGH SCHOOL] [HAN SE KYU - TAEYOUNG HIGH SCHOOL, TAEYOUNG JUNIOR HIGH] [HAN SE KYU] [KANG SEOK HO] [KO JIN WOO] [JANG KI JOO] The four sons of the victims. They grew up in the same neighborhood and have been friends since childhood. They freely entered and exited each others homes and were close friends that would never be under suspicion. [TAEYOUNG ALUMNI] Han Se Kyu's testimony... The only witness was Han Se Kyu. What if his testimony was a lie? Han Se Kyu. I'm Detective Lee Jae Han of the Police Task Force. You know me, right? I called you maybe over ten times. You ignored me every time. Move. I told you to move. Didn't you hear me? Gosh, how elegant. You really do sound educated. You seem like a straight shooter, so let me get right to the point. I hear you saw a suspicious person on your way to the bathroom. Gosh, you're a pain! It's very important, so just confirm it. Is it correct that the culprit jumped out the east window? There were tons of cops here that night, but no one got a look at him. I told you it's correct. Okay? Hey. You said it was the window on the opposite side back then. How much of it is a lie? - What kind of nonsense is this? - No one was ever there, right? If there was someone, there's no way he could have escaped. Why did you lie! I have nothing to say so get lost. Then was it you who did it? What are you doing? You can't be doing this here. It's the work of an amateur. Think about it. Why would a pro make things into such a big debacle? There's no point in aggravating detectives and losing their source of income. I heard you haven't even found the stolen items. This isn't someone being careful. This person doesn't know the route. The work is definitely an amateur, but it's too easy. These are incredibly rich households. The security would be quite something. He got in too easy. Do you think it's someone they know? It's me. An amateur that can enter easily. And he wouldn't get suspected by anyone. It's him. He's the one who did it. Where the heck is Lee Jae Han! You punk! You... Are you crazy? Why would you crawl over there? - Crawl where? I walked! - Is this a joke to you? Chief, are you the one joking around with me? What do you mean? We're just simple-minded men who run where we're told to go. So we might not have known. But you knew, didn't you? Chief, you knew where the Task Force, precinct, and street officers were. You knew where they were all staked out and which way they were running! Here. Take a look. If the culprit had been out that night, there was nowhere for him to escape. So why is it that we couldn't catch him? There was no one to catch in the first place, right? The fourth victim, Han Se Kyu, was lying from the beginning. He made up a thief. He lied to us that he ran "that way". The culprit is caught and this case is over with. The lead that got you that arrest came from Han Se Kyu. If he was lying from the start, we should reinvestigate! Han Se Kyu is the son of the Head Prosecutor. Why would he lie? So does that mean... he's born with a lie detector attached to his mouth? Don't do this so early in the morning. It's giving me an ulcer. Get me a warrant. If I dig around him, I will find something. If Han Se Kyu's testimony was perjury, this needs be overturned. Are you selling pancakes? Overturn what? Overturn what? The Precinct Chief's job was on the line, and he barely got it back. I'm sure the higher-up would really overturn it. Stop calling attention to yourself and just lay low. Chief! It's dirty and you feel screwed. Every person is on a different level. Do you know that? What Han Se Kyu said is the truth. What Oh Kyung Tae said is like bullshit. So... You want me to shut my mouth and watch what I'm doing? With this screwed up situation? If you really want to overturn it, find actual evidence. Unless you have irrefutable evidence, you'll never get an arrest warrant. Wow, what a beautiful world it is. Right? It's a beautiful world. It's a really beautiful world! Oh Kyung Tae refuses to see you. I only need a moment. He's very determined about it, so we can't do anything. Okay. Detective Lee Jae Han, are you listening? Yes, it's me. What happened? What happened with Kyung Tae? He killed a person. A cop has died. What about the larceny case? Have you found who really did it? I've found a suspect, but that's it. I can't even get a glimpse of a warrant. It won't be possible to find evidence around the suspect. By any chance, is your suspect Han Se Kyu, the witness? How did you know that? I read Han Se Kyu's testimony and some parts were off. First, he said it was another man. But then he changed it to Oh Kyung Tae in the end. In cases like this, victims are usually traumatized they have trouble remembering the criminal's face accurately. But Han Se Kyu was certain he knew Oh Kyung Tae. Also, the photo the detectives showed him was over ten years old. Han Se Kyu was still able to pick out his picture from his mid-30s. So the testimony became more mysterious. So... Han Se Kyu already knew Oh Kyung Tae before the incident. He had targeted him. He was an ex-convict and a truck driver. He couldn't have known Han Se Kyu. I don't know how they knew each other. But I'm sure Han Se Kyu knew Oh Kyung Tae. If we can find out how they met we should be able to find out what Han Se Kyu is hiding. Oh Kyung Tae won't meet with me. He refuses. He won't ever want to see me. Ever... Then I will find out. Though it has been twenty years, Oh Kyung Tae does exist here. What you must do is look for evidence there, Detective. The stolen goods that disappeared then still haven't been discovered. That means they didn't steal it for the money. If you can find those items, that will be the evidence you need. I will find them. I have to find them. Lieutenant. Please persuade Kyung Tae. You have to. Detective, you have to solve the case. I'm asking you. So, how do you feel? You must feel bittersweet. You planned this for 20 years and it still failed in the end. Shin Dong Woon must be shedding tears with his daughter right about now. And feeling happy. If you say his name one more time... I'll kill you first. No, you got it all wrong to begin with. Shin Dong Woon was just a victim too. A victim? My daughter died at his hands! If you were in his place, you would've done the same thing. It's not Shin Dong Woon. If you wanted revenge, you should've done it properly. The ones who built a bridge like that... You should've gone after the ones who lied that the bridge was safe. Why? Were you afraid to get revenge on stronger people? The CEO of the construction company. The government officials that sit way above us. What do you know to mouth off? What do you cops know! That's right. I know all about how incompetent and useless the police are. I've experienced as much as you... No, I've felt it more painfully than you. But at the very least, the cop you killed wasn't like that. You killed the one cop who would have understood you! Someone who would understand me? No one in this world... would understand me. The real one is still left. Your daughter, Eun Ji... When your daughter, Eun Ji, was dying... the person who kept you from being able to do anything. The person who manipulated the police and framed you. You need to punish him. That is true revenge. The person who ought to punished is probably living well and happy. He must pay for the crimes that committed now. I will help you. If you cooperate with me, we can catch him. No... Help me. We have to get him. [GAESU-DONG LARCENY CASE] Can you undo the handcuffs? I'm going to try to revive your memory of 20 years ago. The clue will be somewhere in September of 1995 when the burglaries occurred. Let's start with September 1 of that year. Anything involving that day would be helpful. Tell me anything that you remember. I don't remember anything. Let's start in the morning. The weather that day was three degrees Celsius. It was a clear day with a cold wind. Anything would be good. Think slowly about your memories. - Please enjoy. - Yes. - So... - Jae Han. Doesn't this come with sliced beef? Since when did you eat that? All right, all right. Order it. - Ma'am, one order of sliced beef. - Yes. So, you haven't seen any of these stolen items? I know it hasn't made its way into China. No one I know on the streets has bought them either. You're sure? If they were on the streets, I bet the cops would know first. It was such big news. If it's not in the markets, they still have the goods. Where are they hiding it? It wouldn't be in at their home. It would be exposed to too many people. Cottage, Gyeonggi-do, Mikang Daeseon. This is official business right now. Under Han Se Kyu father's name, Han Suk Hee. I just need to take a quick look. Just because you're the police, can you search people's homes like this? Get out of here! Hello. This is the police, right? Some weird person came in and is searching through things. I think you should come. Hey, what are you doing without a warrant? I called the police, just so you know. Yes, I'm leaving. I'm going. Jinsung Bank, Han Se Kyu's personal bank with a safety deposit box. Han Se Kyu has not put any items in the safety deposit box in the past six months. Did you make sure of that? I made sure and checked. And stop asking me for these favors. Puts me in a bad spot. KN Country Club. Gyeonggi-do, Mikang, Hwajoong. Han Se Kyu's golf club. Club Aqua, Han Se Kyu's regular club. SAINT, Han Se Kyu's regular bar. Wooyoung Hotel Fitness Club, Han Se Kyu's gym. Myungwon University, school Han Se Kyu is enrolled in. September 10 was a Sunday. What did you usually do on Sundays? You said you were working in Incheon on the 9th for Thanksgiving. Then did you rest on September 10? Did you go anywhere? I probably worked the day after Thanksgiving too. That's the busiest day for deliveries, so there's no time to rest. Where did you go to deliver? You probably went to pick up delivery items in the morning. What did you pick up? Since it was Thanksgiving, maybe fruit or fish? Or something like meat... It was fish. I delivered fish that day. Gaesu-dong. I went to Gaesu-dong. Gaesu-dong? Who are you? Oh, hi. Gosh, so dirty! I'm sorry. Are you okay? Move your dirty hand. So dirty. It stinks. Just get lost. It's me. Open up. That can't be why... Is that why he pointed at Kyung Tae as the culprit? He knew his face from that day. He lied in his testimony that he saw Kyung Tae. As long as it wasn't him... He didn't care who it was, that dog. What about the stolen good? Have you found them? Stolen goods? Evidence, evidence, evidence... If I only had a warrant... Is it the same over there? If you have money and power... can you live happily and well no matter what awful thing you do? Don't forget about that case from last time. It's been 20 years. Something must have changed, right? Yes... it's different. It's different from back then. We can make it that way. There will be a hint in Oh Kyung Tae's testimony. You have to catch this guy, Detective Lee Jae Han. I can't do it from here. What color did you say his car was again? Red, why? I think I can catch him. No... I'm going to catch him for sure. I'm going head in now. You're dead now. Are you going to arrest me or something? He has to pay for his crimes! That's what the police are supposed to do. I think it's right that we stop. Lieutenant, Lieutenant! This is not the right place for you. This is my fiance who died 20 years ago. You want me to find someone who died 20 years ago? Cha Soo Hyun! Get him! Even if the past changes, there are some things that don't change. Are you Lee Jae Han? Don't worry. I'll do it properly. This time, we're about the same level. Try it. You're in the bathroom? No, no. It's not a prank! Don't hang up. Seriously, who are you looking for? He had been looking for the stolen goods by himself. Use your crap brain to get yourself a lawyer. Han Se Kyu. Even if I get myself fired, I'm going to put you in jail.
