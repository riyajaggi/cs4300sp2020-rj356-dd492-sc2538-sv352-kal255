 [SIGNAL] [EPISODE 11] Here you go. Kim Jin Woo. Was there ever anything strange about him? He never spoke much and it wasn't easy to converse with him. He did seem kind of strange today. Cardboard boxes and string rope? Those are materials he uses when he buries bodies. He's going to kill someone again. I said I would help you. Detective Cha.

 Detective Cha. It's me, Park Hae Young. Detective Cha, pull yourself together! Breathe slowly. Long, deep breaths. Are you okay now? Park Hae Young. What is this? Even if you are a Violent Crimes detective how could you come here alone? I'm all right. How... How did you get here? I found the convenience store where the killer works.

 We have to catch him now. He took cardboard boxes and string rope from the convenience store today. Again. - He's going to kill someone again. - You can't. You need to rest in the car, Detective. I called for backup, so they'll be here soon. No. I have to get him. I have to get him so that this nightmare will end. This punk even wrapped his house in plastic. You're sure this is the place? Get in there. Kim Jin Woo is 37 years old and works on contract at the convenience store. These all belong to the victims. This crazy psycho. He even put their names on them. Noh Hyun Mi, Lee Mi Jung, Nam Goong Sun. We're with the police. We need to look through Kim Jin Woo's personal items. Cha Soo Hyun and Team 1, look through the CCTVs at and around his workplace. Figure out where Kim Jin Woo went after work. Kim Gye Chul and Team 2, look through his finances and phone records. Look through Kim Jin Woo's personal information. Find out about his family and the people he's friendly with. Find out who he's been in touch with recently. Forensics, look for evidence at the suspect's home. Park Hae Young, start profiling the suspect. First victim, Yoon Sang Mi's diary. Second victim, Joo In Hee's name tag. Third, Lee Hye Young's handkerchief. Fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth... Tenth. Only one is missing. I don't see anything for the last victim, Yoo Seung Yeon. I heard from Team 1. According to the CCTVs, he was last seen heading towards his home. But there aren't many CCTVs in the area. We can't figure out where he went after. I think we can get access to black box cameras if we ask people in the area. We looked into Kim Jin Woo's family. His parents got divorced when he was younger. He lived with his mother afterwards. His mother?s name is Lee Soon Young and the house is in her name too. The suspect lived with his mother? No, there are no signs of a woman living here at all. I don't see any cosmetics or anything. This thing here... I think it's a human bone. What am I supposed to do? We just need to check the files in your black box camera briefly. I'm sorry. He walked by here last night at 11:00 p.m. What? If he walked over that way, that would be... That's Dongeui Mountain, where he buried the bodies. [PARK HAE YOUNG] It's me. When you were kidnapped before, you said you felt a body in the wardrobe. I think that memory was correct. A bone was found in the wardrobe closet. He had kept someone's body in there. It wouldn't have been just any normal victim. If he kept that body in his home it means that he had a personal tie to that dead victim. If that body was disposed outside, his identity could be exposed as well. What if that body belonged to his mother? I don't know why he's burying his mother after keeping her with him for 18 years. Something has definitely changed with Kim Jin Woo. You guys go this way and you go this way. Wait. It's the song that Yoo Seung Yeon liked. Over there! This time... I'll help you. You... can't end things this easily. Never. As for the skeletal remains found with the Hongwon-dong killer, Kim Jin Woo they have been confirmed to be his mother, Lee Soon Young. Using her dental condition we estimate that she died in her mid-40s. She died before 1997 when the first victim was killed. We cannot be sure of the cause of death. But we didn't find any signs of trauma to the hyoid or neck. We're leaning more towards natural death, rather than murder. So let's say he didn't kill his mother. Why did he kill the other women? After his parents divorced when he was seven he lived with a severely depressed mother. He was neglected and abused as a child. I believe that caused him to start killing. Because you were abused as a child, you kill someone? Crazy piece of trash. Good work. Tie up the loose ends well for the prosecutors. I'll be holding a press conference, so prepare a press release. Yes, sir. What... what was that? That's it? Shouldn't we get some sort of a prize? A promotion, or something? A culprit that the police lost initially killed nine more people. Do you think they want to make a big deal over this? I'm feeling kind of uneasy. Let's go for a macchiato. Macchiato, yeah right. Let's have soju. The last victim, Yoo Seung Yeon's personal item... Was it this? The song she liked to listen to often. I heard you had it on replay. Were you listening to this repeatedly for a year? Yoo Seung Yeon was different, right? I will help you. Kim Jin Woo probably didn't even realize that he liked that woman. No one ever taught him what those feelings were. He probably could not kill after that. And that's why he tried to commit suicide. If he can't kill... he has no reason to live. Do you think that way too, Detective Cha? That's he's just a "crazy piece of trash"? Even if his childhood was hard Kim Jin Woo still killed 11 people. I don't have any sympathy for him. There are those who are born monsters but there are also those who are made into monsters by people. If someone... If just one person had held out a helping hand... Sun Woo! Mister, that's my brother! That's my brother, Mister! Sun Woo! Kim Jin Woo and the dead victims... could all have been saved. Lieutenant, what happened? Have you caught the killer? Detective... Yes, I'm listening! Did you catch him? We caught him. They caught him... Okay, so who is it? Detective, I'm sure you know it by now. We can't decide other people's lives. If we're not careful the wrong person's life could get ruined. So we should just stand by and watch people die? When I first received these transmissions this is what you said... You said I should never give up. These cold cases exist because someone gave up on them. So you should not give up, Detective. Give up, the case is closed. What do you mean? The Chief closed down the case. He wants to know how long we're going to drag out a kidnapping case. He threw a big fit and left. After everything I said to him... What now? - I can't give up now. I just need to... - Hey! If there was a lead we could find, we would've found it by now. Are you going to do this for ten thousand years? You're the one who'll get hurt going up against the Chief. Hey, Cha Soo Hyun! Oh, you came back. How are you? Are you okay? What a relief though. You really went through a lot. [1997 HONGWON-DONG CASE] Touch it. See if you mistook a mannequin, or if it really was a corpse. See for yourself. Do it. I know you can. This is it. It felt like this. Are you sure? Why wasn't the body in the wardrobe disposed of? Why? What was he afraid of? Maybe... This was a body that could expose his identity if it got discovered. What if he didn't live alone? What if two people lived in the home? Here are the records for areas 5 to 8. Yes, thank you. So he hasn't been back to Korea from Saudi Arabia recently? - No. - Okay, thank you. Sure. The Hongwon-dong case is gone. - Here are the documents you asked for. - Thank you. [HONGWON-DONG MURDERS INVESTIGATION REPORT] January 21, 1998. The suspect was arrested in his home. Housewife, Seo Young Jin went missing in May 2005. She was 35 years old. Mom. Are you going to the market? I'll go with you. What's for dinner today? All the victims from after the year 2000 have survived. They are still alive to this day. [GYEONGGI PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT] He was sentenced to life in 1998 for murder. His symptoms became severe in prison, so he was sent here. Right here. You can head out that way. Oh, are you the new volunteers? Thank you so much for coming. In exchange for the lives that were reclaimed... I don't know what misfortune has fallen on another. As long as they are alive... As long as they are living somehow... At least, there is a small chance for hope. Hey, are you crazy? What? You're going on your marriage setup date looking like that? What? I'm wearing my best jeans. No, no. You can't. You can't do that. - Why not? - No, you can't. Yes, this is it. Look how great you look in pink. I wonder what kind of style the lawyer will like. I'll do it. And what's up with your skin? I told you many times last night to put a mask on your face. Good, right? So pretty! Get going now. [NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE OH YOON SEO] Welcome. A club sandwich please. - Do you want that toasted? - Yes. Aren't you off-duty today? I have more fun here. Hey, Hwang Eui Kyung! Why aren't you cleaning over here? Yes, coming. [UNNATURAL DEATH (SKELETAL REMAINS) REPORT] The skeletal remains... Oh, you're here together today. What is this? Please continue. Yes, gender is male. There is metal in the right shoulder. I'll know once the DNA results are in. It could be the person you've been looking for. [FEBRUARY 12, 1999] Lee Kyung Woo. You have no job. How many of you have been told "I love you" by this man? He did hide his marital status. When you sleep with a woman, of course you say "I love you". What am I supposed to say? Tell her to get lost? What did you just say? Don't drop honorifics with me. You play around with people's feelings? You're the worst kind of person in the whole world. You can meet a better man. Why are you crying? Here you go. Wipe your tears. Thank you. When did you meet Lee Min Kyung? Month and day? "He confessed his feelings and met with me three times." That's all I need. You can all go home. Ouch. Hey. - Get over there now. - Where? What? - Over there. - Where? Why? - Over there. Don't you see the door? - I'm going, okay? Stop that. Use your words. Who do you think you're pointing at? Huh? Who, who? Okay, okay. Just get out of here. - Okay, over here? - To the left! To the left. Cha Soo Hyun, just because she's in a one-sided love... She's being too emotional about this. You saw that box of chocolates, right? Is she going to do it this time? So she's going to tell him her feelings after two years? What about Jae Han? How can he be in the dark by himself? That guy is so clueless. What would he know? Why does Cha Soo Hyun even like him? That's the mystery of the world. It really is a mystery. Here comes the mystery. What? Hey, so it's Valentine's Day the day after tomorrow. The day you give chocolates, right? Jae Han, do you have anyone who'd give you something? I really don't like women who give things like that. It's kind of pathetic and vain. Do you have a lighter? This one doesn't work. Try this. What happened? Did you tell him? - What did he say? - Don't talk to me. Why? Did you get rejected? - Shut up. - Seriously? Look at this. I knew it. You idiot. You couldn't even give him chocolates? What is so great about him that you can't even tell him that you like him? Is he Jang Dong Gun or something? What do you like about him so much? Just tell me. Why are you all cleaning suddenly? You should come and help too. The Congressman is coming today for a visit. What are we? In high school? Just do what we always do. Are you doing you coffee girl role? Are you going to keep serving coffee instead of working on cases? Hey, why are you picking on a sick person? Do you think she likes doing it? Every time highup people come, they bring her in as a mascot. You think she likes it? Don't they have hands or feet? Why does a woman have to make coffee? What are you doing in here? The Congressman is here. Hurry! Goodness, the Congressman will get thirsty. Isn't the coffee coming? One of our employees, Officer Cha Soo Hyun, is preparing it. She is our very first female officer. She's the flower here in our station. Is that right? I told Lee Jae Han to look for you. Where did he go off to? The coffee tray was all ready to go, right? It was here just a moment ago. Where did it go? The police organization is going through a major cleanup too. Oh, I think our flower is here. Hello. I'm Detective Lee Jae Han. Here you go. Here is coffee, cream, and sugar. How many spoons do you like of each? Should I just do two? Hurry up. Just say sorry to them for now. Are you insane? Senior. Look at this, look at this. You've lost all assertiveness. You're always blinking like that and smiling too much. That's why they tell you to get coffee! How long are you going to be the "flower"? Well... they told me to be amiable. Look, there you go again opening your eyes big and pretty. If you're in Violent Crimes, you need to have steely eyes. You're sick because you go around acting so tender and weak. Look at us! Have you ever seen us sick 365 days out of a year? Don't you dare be sick again. You'll get it from me, okay? Move it. Miss Lee, give me a coffee too. Want to die? Oh, Miss Lee. Is it because of the coffee? I asked you what you liked about him. Huh? I don't know! What's with you suddenly? Mom! Soo Hyun's acting weird. I think she must be sick. Mom! What happened? Is the DNA a match? No, it wasn't a match. It's someone else. You came for no reason on your day off. By the way, is this your usual style? It's not like you're on a marriage setup... Or were you really on one? Mind your own business. Are you really going to get married? What's it to you whether I get married or not? You're off duty too, so what are you doing here? Why in the world are you so obsessed with Lee Jae Han? I told you why. I'm just thankful to him. Don't tell me those nonsense, and tell me the truth. What is it? If I tell you the truth, will you believe me? I have trouble believing it myself. Do you think you can? What? You should be a little softer to the man you're meeting today. If you act like you're interrogating him, all men will run away. Park Hae Young! Lieutenant... Lieutenant Park Hae Young? Yes, Detective. This is Park Hae Young. It was you who arrested Kim Jin Woo, wasn't it? What happened with that? Did anything strange happen after that? No, everyone is safe, thanks to you. Really? That's a relief. What a relief. There's only one case left now. One case? What do you mean? Is it 1999 for you right now? Yes, how did you know that? The Injoo female high school student case in the year 1999. It's the last case that was written in your notes. You will start investigating that case. A female high school student in Injoo? What case is that and what happens there? I have a favor to ask of you, Detective. Find out what happened in Injoo in 1999. Please tell me the truth about that case. To me... it is extremely important. But the city of Injoo is not my jurisdiction. I don't know what happens there, but... [FEBRUARY, 1999 - INJOO] [INJOO HIGH SCHOOL] You guys! Did you see our school website? Hurry up and take a look. Everything started in the willow tree house. It started with one and then came seven people. And then came ten demons in the end. Evil is not far away. It is in our midst. She was a friend and classmate, but they stomped on her like animals. They are still among us. - Hey! - What? Hurry up and look. Hey... look. What is it? If it's the willow tree house, it's that place. It's larger than a right angle and less than 180 degrees. That is called an obtuse angle. Look, it's bigger than 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees. - Okay. - And this is... - Hold on. - Okay. Hello? Yeah, it's me? What is it? I told you to stay home. Can't I come too? It's not a place that you can go. I'll be right back. Do you understand this? Everything started in the willow tree house. Does this makes any sense? Is this about our school? It started with one and then came seven people. And then came ten demons in the end. Evil is not far away. It is in our midst. She was a friend and classmate, but they stomped on her like animals. They are still among us. They laugh and talk as if nothing has happened. There are many who have done wrong, but none who have been punished. Where did things go wrong? What am I supposed to do? He's here. I'm the Chief of the Seoul Special Police Task Force, Kim Bum Joo. What about the police? Tomorrow, the police will appoint personnel for the cleanup task. Is that so? To keep an organization from rotting, new people should be brought in. I'll do whatever you ask. I will pledge loyalty to you. What do you mean? Pledge loyalty to me? A cop should do no such thing. No matter what happens, a police officer should not be swayed. You should be fair and open... in your investigation. Yes, of course. Fair and open. Without a single error. I will do it without any error. Yes, I'll take care of it as fast as I can. I'll head down myself, so don't worry. It was a high school student? How could it happen in Injoo? These are just young kids. And what about the parents? You can't put into words how they feel. This is crazy. What's with the atmosphere in here? - You're here, Detective? - Yeah. What? There was a rape case in Injoo. It's a bit... Why? The victim is a high school student. The number of perpetrators is already over ten. Ten... ten? Injoo? Find out what happens in Injoo in 1999. Please tell me the truth about that case. I can't believe those young kids did it. Yeah, that's what I mean. Attention, everyone. I'm sure you've all heard. There's a case in Injoo. The local precinct is having a hard time handling the case. They've asked us to form a special task force. I will go down myself with a team. The team is Kim Jung Jae, Choi Seok Won, Kim Hyun Chul, Choi Sung Hoon. Get your toothbrushes. We're all going to Injoo. Yes. Sung Hoon. See me for a second. Okay, I'll be leaving now. Okay, are you all... What's with you? Detective Choi wasn't feeling well, so I said I'd go in his place. Is there a reason that I can't go? Let's go. [CITY OF INJOO] Is that it? I think that's it. Is that it? Yeah, it is. Are you here from the task force? What direction is the investigation going to take? There are reports that this investigation is being purposely scaled down. Please give us something. Are you with the task force? Out of the way! Move. Okay, we got it! Move! Where is this investigation heading towards? Okay, okay. We'll get to it later! Please come this way. We need to investigate the kids, so just be quiet for a bit! Investigate the kids! Whose permission do you have to conduct this investigation? What did my son do wrong? That's why we're conducting the investigation. Investigation? What investigation? A girl planned it and seduced him. Which of you here wouldn't have fallen for it? My son has done absolutely nothing wrong, okay? Thank you for coming here from such a long way. - Have something to drink. - Thank you. - Is that them? - Oh, yes. Those are the families of the boys that the victim accused in her initial testimony. There are bad rumors about those boys all over the city. Those punks go around doing all sorts of bad things. - What was that about before? - What? What the reporters were saying out there? Oh, that's just nonsense that they made up. Who would scale down an investigation? - Calm down. - My son has to study! Be quiet already! Be quiet! [INJOO GANG RAPE CASE] This is just a big mess from start to end. - The thing is... - Because you work like this... the reporters are making noise like that. This isn't the 80s or anything. You have to be more transparent in your investigation. What? I think you don't know very well... This, right here... this was the beginning. We deleted this as soon as it went up. That's what I'm saying! That's where you went wrong. The students are already talking. Deleting it won't stop the rumors. Give the original post to the reporters. What? But... This world has many people who are like worthless bugs that don't deserve to live. To catch people like that, you need to nip the problem in the bud. First one will fall, then seven, then the other ten. Once you catch those 18 bugs, it will all be over. They're just trash that are ruining the image of your city. Why not disinfect this place clean while you can? And do it openly. Whatever the case, I'll put my trust in you, Chief Kim Bum Joo. I need you to take care of something for me too. This post... I need you to find out who put it up. I've been looking for that person too. Don't just be looking! I need you to find that person. Is this all true? Who wrote this? Can't you tell by looking? It's anonymous. We think it's an Injoo High School student but we don't know much else. If this is true, the number of students involved could be a lot higher. We should keep looking until the end. Kim Jung Jae, look into where this assault occurred. Lee Jae Han, meet the victim and find out if this post is true. I want the rest of you to find out who put this up on the site. Each Injoo Precinct cop can partner with someone from the task force. That's all. Okay. It was very hectic before, so I didn't get to say hello. I'm Detective Ahn Chi Soo from Injoo Precinct. - I'm Detective Lee Jae Han. - Nice to meet you. Let's get to work. Yes. The patient's vitals are not good, so please check them. [AHN HYUN KYUNG] And change the patient's saline solution. - Half her dosage. - Yes. I don't think she'll last long. I think you should prepare yourself. [KIM BUM JOO] Your daughter is in critical condition? Is that why you did it? Your daughter is going to die anyway so you don't need money for hospital fees. Is that why you acted like this? Park Hae Young is the little brother of Park Sun Woo, who died back then. You already knew, didn't you? Why didn't you say anything if you knew! I raised a dog and you bite your owner? You may be Section Chief, but I could kill you right this instant. I know. What? It's all over now. [RESIGNATION] [CITY OF INJOO] [ASSAILANT ADDED IN INJOO GANG RAPE CASE] [GANG RAPE CASE IN INJOO] [SECTION CHIEF AHN CHI SOO] This is Park Hae Young. Park Hae Young. I know why you're hung up on the Injoo case. I feel regret about your brother Park Sun Woo dying like that too. What are you saying? Did you look into my background? How much do you know? That case is much more dangerous than you realize. If you find out the truth, you'll be in danger like you brother. No, I have to know the truth. I need to know why my brother had to die like that. Even if I have to die, I will find out. If you think you can handle the truth come down to Injoo. Do you know what happened back then? Yes, I know. What happened back then... I set the whole thing up with my own hands. Is that true? Two hours... in front of Injoo Hospital. Hello? Section Chief? Over here. The victim's name is Kang Hae Seung. She's in her junior year. Right this way, on the 5th floor. Okay. She hung out often with the students that she is accusing of rape. She attempted to commit suicide after this got out. She's not mentally well right now, so you may not be able to see her. It's correct. What are you saying is correct? Everything written on there. She only said there were ten assailants in her first testimony. Why would she have lied? A girl just went through something like that. Do you think she wants to admit that there were more? She said she was ashamed. Does she remember who they all were? She says she hangs out with them at night. That girl is too easy with her body and that's why this happened. She's sure about this list, right? She even signed the thing. With the first statement and today, you're speaking on her behalf. I would like to meet her and speak to her directly. The victim is still not mentally fit for that. They won't allow visitors. It's just for a moment. Whether it's a moment or not, I said it's not allowed. I'm done talking, so just leave. Have you been drinking? What the heck now? I've had enough of you. I said I'm done talking, so leave. I can't even drink with my own mouth now? You think being a detective makes you all that? - Hey! - Are you Hae Soon? I'm a detective from Seoul. If you have anything to tell me yourself, you can call me. Are you trying to kill my daughter? What if something happened to the victim? He's an alcoholic. Even if he is an alcoholic, he's the victim's father. - No. - Wait. We can use the list of names to find out the truth. We can start investigation now. Let's go. Come on. How annoying. Why is he leaving this behind? I told you not to come around. Is Hae Seung okay? Would you be okay if you were her? Get lost now. You better not come back. This is Lee Jae Han. Where is that? Okay, got it. They found the crime scene. Hey, what's going on? It was a meat restaurant couple years ago but now it's closed down. The neighborhood bad kids liked to hang out in there. And they called the meat restaurant the willow tree house. What about CCTVs. Who puts CCTVs around a building like this? But the people who farmed land across here and neighbors saw them often. Getting their witness statements is going to help a lot. - Let's go. - Okay. It's been a while. They've been using that building a long time now. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. They're always drinking and smoking. If you call the cops, it only helps that one time. Can you pick out those students from these photos? This one here. Him... and this guy. Him too. There would have been a female student with those students too. Yes, there was one. They're here again. Gosh. What are they doing? That girl is back too. Hey, Kang Hae Seung. Hurry up! It's her. Her. That's right. This is the girl. Yes, yes. You're sure of that? Yes, I'm sure. I've seen her several times. I'm very sure! Thank you. Were you girls friendly with Hae Seung? She doesn't have many friends at school. She doesn't come to school often either. I've seen her in the city often though. She's with the partying type a lot. Partying type? I know it's a little bit of trouble, but take a look at this. Look for the kids that you've seen her with in the city. You can all come close and look. - Can you see? - Oh, here is one. - That's right, that's right. - And this person too. - Right? - And him. No, this is correct. There were no female students? No, there weren't. Okay. Take your time looking. [INJOO FEMALE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT GANG RAPE CASE] Jung Han Young. Jung Han Young. There are 18 in total from the board and it matches the victim's list. If we could get confessions from the perpetrators, this could work out. What now? Everything is circumstantial. Hey, this isn't Seoul. There are no CCTVs in this town. How can we get real evidence? It's a miracle we have eyewitnesses' testimonies. This case is almost over, so let's go get some sleep. Hey, stop it and go, okay? I can't go sleep if you won't. Detective, you're from Seoul right? Yes, why? A student just came by. He asked me to give this to Detective Lee Jae Han from Seoul. Oh, okay. [1998 INJOO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT COUNCIL LEADERS RETREAT] Seven of them. ["SEVEN PEOPLE"] "People." ["IN"] ["GAN"] ("In gan" means "person") It can't be... Section Chief. Section Chief... what is this? What is all this? Turn this place upside down. Bring the culprit to me. You'll have to cooperate with the investigation. Why aren't you picking up if you're home? What are you hiding? Why won't you say that you lied? Search Park Hae Young thoroughly. This case isn't going to work. There's nothing that you can do. Did you find the radio? I think they must have found out. Both you and I are finished. - Park Sun Woo. - My brother didn't do it, right? Answer me! Just stay calm. I'm ordering you as your team leader. What are you doing? Can a cop do this? Of course not. You said that you would grant me a wish. What is your wish? Are you my dad? Wow, you have no conscience. You think the Police University is like an internet cafe that anyone can go to? Right? How could I be a cop?
