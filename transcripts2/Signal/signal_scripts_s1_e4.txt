 [SIGNAL] Detective Lee Jae Han. Officer 22, Gyeonggi Youngsan precinct. Officer Lee Jae Han here. She was found in a field of reeds next to the thorn tree forest by Highway 3. Who are you? Do you have a Lieutenant Park Hae Young on your team? - I heard something weird on the radio. - Get out! What do you think it would be like if you could communicate with the past? Who exactly are you! I caught the culprit at the Hyunpoong train tracks. But if you're really in the year 1989, Choi Young Shin will die.

 Another victim has been found! She's the eighth victim. The reason he wasn't caught was because of that bus. It's the bus! I'm sure it's bus 95. Let's start from the beginning. It's him. It's the same knot from before. If you really are in the year 1989 please stop it from happening. Kim Won Kyung, officer worker. Won Kyung... Hey! Is anyone here? Please, you can save her. - Please. - Please. Please, please, please, please... [EPISODE 4] Won Kyung, Won Kyung!

 Won Kyung! Hi, is Won Kyung home? No, she said she's working late today. Working late... Okay. Why, why? Won Kyung, Won Kyung! Won Kyung. The ninth victim is Kim Wong Kyung, an office employee. November 7, 1989 at 9:30 p.m. On the streets of Hyunpoong-dong. Please, please, please... Sir, have you seen a young woman by any chance? She has light skin and hair down to here. Over there? Okay. Thank you, thank you! Thank you. Won Kyung! You have the results? Of course, who am I? I'm Jung Hun Ki. - I got something. - What is it? I got the fingerprint result from the broken piece of glass. This was the day before I went to meet Lee Chun Goo. He knew I'd meet Jung Kyung Soon too, and went before I did. Did you say Lee Chun Goo? These prints belong to Lee Chun Goo. So the killer is the bus driver Lee Chun Goo. Jung Kyung Soon retired in 1990. Those are the only records we have. We already told all of this to the detectives that came earlier. - Detectives? - Yes. Were they from Gyeonggi district? Yes. Can you take a look at this? Did they ask you about Bus 95? What? Bus 95? They didn't mention that. It's a bus that ran 26 years ago. Is there anyone here that would know about that bus? Hello. I'm Lieutenant Park Hae Young from the Seoul Metropolitan Police. Yes, I remember. One of our attendants died back then, so the atmosphere was very bad. Was there anything you heard about what happened back then? I don't know much about it. I wasn't working that day. I think that Chun Goo would know about it. He went to speak to the police about it back then. Do you know Lee Chun Goo well? Of course, we were both regular drivers. But he had to quit after that incident. Something bad happened. What's his name again? Lee Chun Goo. Lee Chun Goo? He's not a patient here. He's not a patient here, he is a patient's guardian. A guardian? - What is it? - Have you met Lee Chun Goo? No, not yet. Lee Chun Goo is the killer. The fingerprints and CCTV all confirm it. What's the room number? Something bad? His son had an accident. He wanted to take care of him, so he got his retirement money and quit. I haven't seen him since then. One moment. This is Park Hae Young. Get to Saewoon Hospital. What are you saying? Lee Chun Goo is the culprit. What? There's no way. Lee Chun Goo doesn't match the profile of the Gyeonggi Nambu killer. Who cares about the profiling? Just get over there now! That can't be. Lee Chun Goo was driving the bus when Choi Young Shin got caught. He can't be the killer and his age too... - How old was he? - Huh? Back when he got into the accident, how old was Lee Chun Goo's son? It was right after he graduated high school. So he was probably about 20 years old. His wife died when the boy was young, so he raised him by himself. Chun Goo felt bad about leaving him home alone. He let him ride along on the bus everyday. He was very devoted to him. I guess he had good memories of that. Even when he got older, he would ride it all day till the last stop. I gave him rides a few times too. He was a sick boy, so he couldn't get a job. And it didn't feel right to leave him home all day. So he rode the 95 bus all day? The victims were all in different age groups and had different jobs. They all lived in different areas too. They had only one thing in common. The all died while taking the bus home. I put the locations of their deaths into the Geopros program. I got the result of a bus that is currently running. Bus 95. All the victims rode that bus. What if Lee Chun Goo isn't the killer? [NAME: LEE JIN HYUNG GUARDIAN: LEE CHUN GOO] What if it was a lie? What if Lee Chun Goo had no choice but to lie? Leave now. Hey! Look, I think someone's fighting. Jin Hyung, did something happen out there? No, nothing happened. Goodbye. Bye, Miss. I'm so tired. I need to go home and rest. - Get going. - Bye. Wait for me a bit. Let's go home together. I'll head home first. See you there. Min Joo... Chun Goo said this constantly. "I would do anything for my son." You remember, right? Someone ran onto the bus? No one got on at that stop. Sir, have you seen a young woman by any chance? Thank you, thank you. Won Kyung! Won Kyung! No, no... [PARK HAE YOUNG] - It's me. - It's not Lee Chun Goo! Lee Chun Goo most likely murdered Jung Kyung Soon to destroy the evidence. But the real Gyeonggi Nambu killer is someone else. So who is it? Detective Cha Soo Hyun? Detective Cha? Detective Cha, are you listening? Detective Cha! I can't get in touch with Detective Cha Soo Hyun. - Are you hurt? - Are you all right? What's going on? Where's Lee Chun Goo? Who is he? It's him. The Gyeonggi Nambu serial killer isn't Lee Chun Goo. It's him. I wasn't trying to kill you. I opened my eyes and she had a gun. That's why I did it. No, Park Hae Young is right. He's the killer. It's not me! Don't move, you punk! Have you seen TV? The Gyeonggi Nambu serial killer that put fear in the entire nation has finally been arrested by the police after 26 years. Under the pressure of the re-investigation the criminal chose to turn himself in. He was arrested by Gyeonggi Police and is currently being questioned. I did it. I killed Jung Kyung Soon. I killed everyone 26 years ago. Lee Chun Goo is not him. He likely killed Jung Kyung Soon and he knew he'd be caught so he's taking responsibility for his son's crimes. What about the son? Has he confessed to his crimes? No. - What about other evidence? - There's nothing conclusive. I'm sure you know how the police organization works. When it comes to cases that gathers media attention it isn't easy for the police to admit that they arrested the wrong person. That means the police were fooled by the suspects. Without evidence to overturn Lee Chun Goo's confession no one will believe what the cold case squad team has to say. Gosh, I worked hard for once. It was all for nothing. This case is over with now. What are you doing? I just feel stuffy. [KIM WON KYUNG - OFFICE EMPLOYEE NOVEMBER 7, 19899:30 P.M.] Detective. Are you listening? It's me, Park Hae Young. Are you listening, Detective? Yes, I'm listening. What about the last victim? What happened to her? Kim Won Kyung, the office worker. Is she still alive? Have you caught the killer? You said it's 2015 there. Have you caught the killer? Detective, what's wrong? Something is wrong, isn't it? I asked you if you've caught the killer. Have you caught him? Well, the thing is... The bus driver, Lee Chun Goo... Is it him? Is it him? It is, isn't it? - No, it isn't him. He's... - Then who is it! I will go and kill that person, so tell me now! Detective, why... You've probably only seen pictures. Just a few pictures. Victims' names, jobs, time of death, and location. That's all you know about them, but not me. Sir, have you seen a young woman by any chance? - She has light skin and hair down to... - Over there. Won Kyung! Where are you? She was alive just days ago. She comforted me. Be strong. She smiled at me and she was kind. She just lived her life diligently! Thank you, thank you. Won Kyung... Won Kyung... I'm going to kill that crazy bastard. I'm going kill him just the same way. I'll kill him with my own hands! You can't do that, Detective. Then you'll become just like him. You'll become a criminal. Detective, are you listening to me? We still have a chance. Bus attendant Jung Kyung Soo knew the killer. You have to interrogate her. Detective... Detective Lee Jae Han! Detective! Jung Kyung Soon... - Jung Kyung Soon? - Yes. Jung Kyung Soon was threatening Lee Chun Goo. I don't know what about. I'm sure it is evidence proving Lee Jin Hyung is the killer. If we can find that, we can expose him. If there was something like that, Gyeonggi district would've found it. They would have gone through the crime scene and Lee Chun Goo's things. Yes, even Lee Chun Goo went through the house after killing her. But he couldn't find it. So it's not in that house, it's at another location. Where is that? That's what we need to find out. Gosh, seriously? The statute of limitations on the Gyeonggi Nambu case was in 2004. Up until then, it was a source of money she could use to blackmail Lee Chun Goo. After that, she likely hid it somewhere. But the statute of limitations no longer exists. A statute of limitations will no longer exist for violent crimes before 2000. Investigations on cold cases will no longer be prohibited. She saw the news about the statute of limitations and she felt it could be a source of money again. What's the first thing she would have done? She would check on the evidence she used to blackmail him. You're not actually going along with this, are you? The statute of limitations on this case was lifted on October 1. If we follow her tracks on that day, we can find the evidence. Hey, hello? The Superintendent is going to present the results of the investigation himself. Why are you trying to mess that up? The Chief is not supporting this, so do we really have to? Please, let's not do this. Park Hae Young and I will check out Jung Kyung Soon's house again. You guys check out where she went and her phone and card records. - Okay. - Just don't do it! Don't do it! Don't! Are you okay? Your neck. I'm embarrassed I got attacked by him. Do you think I'd be okay? You shouldn't have gone in there to face a man alone. If I'm choosy about facing men or women, I need to turn in my badge now. What did you find? I looked up her card and phone records for October 1. There's nothing that could be a lead. Are you sure you didn't overlook it? The card was over the limit and she didn't talk to anyone on the phone. If you don't trust me, don't ask me to do it. She's unorganized and has a lazy personality. She's not a detailed person. Be quiet and just dig in. Do you always work like this? Yeah, I'm always like this when I don't have time. It was cold on October 1. It will be faster to look at warmer clothing. No matter how much clothes women have, they have a few pieces they wear often. Find the ones with worn out sleeves or smell strongly of perfume. I told you she is unorganized and has a lazy personality. [SEOUL - SUNYANG] She has a cousin that lives in Sunyang. I checked the records. She lived with her from 2002 to 2004. She came by suddenly a while ago. Did she look for something while here? I'm not sure. She went into the storage without even saying hello. I assumed she went to get the things she left behind. - Is it this? - Yes. Did you touch this, by any chance? No, why would I? I am standing in from Gyeonggi District Police Station. The Gyeonggi Nambu serial murders has been under a veil for 26 years. Will the whole story be exposed today? There will be a presentation on the investigation by the Gyeonggi District. The whole nation's eyes and ears are focused on this room right now. - Who are you? - I'm with the police. What is this? What are you doing? What do you think you're doing? You're certain about this investigation? The locations and the M.O. all matches Lee Chun Goo's confession. I'm certain that Lee Chun Goo is the murderer. Good work. I will be starting the presentation on the Gyeonggi Nambu investigation. On October 20, the M.O. used to murder Jung Kyung Soon was determined to bear a resemblance to the Gyeonggi Nambu case by our investigative team. They used nearby CCTV, fingerprints, and blood evidence and found a suspect. First, as the Superintendent responsible for deterrence of such crimes I would like to apologize to the families of the victims. Superintendent. What is that? [DNA RESULTS] Did you find out something new? - Can you continue? - What is it you're looking at? Is there some confusion? The citizens are very interested. Please tell us. - What is it? - Can you tell us? Is it something you can't share? While we were in the process of investigating Jung Kyung Soon's murder we were successful in finding the Gyeonggi Nambu serial killer. Are you certain Lee Chun Soo is the culprit? - Is there evidence? - What's his motive? Is there an accomplice? - Can you elaborate on the motive? - As for the presentation... I'll hand it over to the lead detective. Detective Cha Soo Hyun of cold case squad at Seoul Metropolitan Police. I assume you're prepared. What's going on here? My cold case squad discovered Jung Kyung Soon on October 20. During our investigation... we found conclusive evidence that led us to arrest the Gyeonggi Nambu serial killer. When you were questioned at the police station... that was when it started, wasn't it? Lee Chun Woo? You drove the bus that Hwang Min Joo worked on that night, right? Yes, I did. Did anyone get on at the Hyunpoong stop? He was in a black jacket and in his early to mid-20s. You remember, right? Thank you for your help. Yes. By the way... If it's a black jacket and early 20s... that sounds a lot like Jin Hyung. I need to go home and rest. - Get going now. - Yes, bye. He was on the bus that day. Which stop did Jin Hyung get on that day? He was on it from the beginning. Over there. Thank you, thank you. Won Kyung! Jung Kyung Soon had stored away this piece of evidence. It has the fingerprints and blood of the last Gyeonggi Nambu victim. Also, it holds the DNA of the killer. The killer who was arrested with this piece of evidence was paralyzed from the waist down 26 years ago. He was a patient in a medical facility and is the son of Lee Chun Goo. His name is Lee Jin Hyung. My son didn't do it. My son isn't like that. My poor son. He grew up so lonely without his mother. You really are something. First victim, college student Chae Eun Young. Second victim, mother of two, Park Soon Hee. Third, Kim Yoon Joo who was about to get married. Fourth, Kim Mal Soon who died a day before her birthday. Look at them straight on. You're not the only one with family precious to you. They have family that's precious to them too. Do you really feel nothing for them? You should feel sorry to them! You don't know anything. Don't speak that way when you don't know anything! My poor son... He's already paid for his crimes. He paid for his crimes back then! Oh my! Why? Why are you doing this? No, no. You can't! No. You... No, no, no! No! Hey. Hey! Get over here. Hey! Why did you do it? Why! Why did you do it? Why, why, why, why! Why did you do it? Why, why, why, why... So, that's why... You lied because he's your son? That no one got on the bus? My son didn't do it. No one got on the bus. If you had answered the question properly back then... She wouldn't have died. She would be alive now. I don't know what you're talking about. My son didn't do it! Please, just stop it! This isn't over. He will kill again. He will murder again! But... There's no one left from the bus. I'm the only one left. Even if you put a knife to my throat, my son didn't do it! Is that right? Even with a knife to your throat, you can't do it. Then I have no choice. I have no evidence. I have no witnesses. I'll to end with my own hands. Right? No, you can't! Let go of me! Jin Hyung! No! Jin Hyung! That crazy man dropped my son. What more punishment must he take? That crazy man? Detective Lee Jae Han stopped it? Stopped the murders? My legs... what's wrong with them? It's okay, Jin Hyung. My legs, my legs, my legs! My legs! My legs, no! Leave and don't come back. I heard what you told the doctor. That your son tripped backwards and fell. I'm going to go. And I'm turning myself in for what I did to your son. So get your son to turn himself in as well. I don't know what you're saying. Neither my son or you have anything to turn yourselves into the police for. My son just tripped backwards and fell. You weren't even there. Are you going to hide this until the very end? My son has suffered enough. Can't you see that? He is paralyzed from the waist down. He will be bedridden for his whole life. Think of what your son has done. At the very least, the victims' families deserve to know. Get him to turn himself in. My son is just a poor boy without a mother. Now he will become even more pitiful. I can't make his life even more miserable. Leave! We have suffered enough misery. We have paid for our crimes. If they hadn't started investigating again everyone could forget it and live. Why? Why are they digging this up again? Why, why? What if Detective Lee Jae Han had killed your son that day? Would you be able to forget? As if nothing happened? Could you laugh, talk, eat, and sleep? Could you have lived happily? They didn't pass away in the arms of their loved ones. They died on the cold ground shaking in horror. Someone out there... should remember. It's the same for Jung Kyung Soon. She may have been greedy for money and blackmailed people. But she did not deserve to die. Even her death... I will remember it. Everyone's going out for drinks. I'm not up for it. You should find something else. Whether it be drinking... Or going to a boxing gym and beating things to death. Find something. It's your first time seeing a dead person, isn't it? No matter how many times you see it, you don't get used to murder. It's not because it's your first time. Seeing a dead person will continue to be difficult. So find something to help you deal with it. What are you doing? A woman's neck shouldn't look like this. You shouldn't drink either, Detective Cha. Go to the hospital instead. Also... It isn't my first time. Seeing a dead body. It's your first time seeing a dead person, isn't it? [HIGH SCHOOL GANG RAPE CASE IN INJOO] Mom? Sun Woo? Mom? Sun Woo. Sun Woo, Sun Woo! Sun Woo! Sun Woo, open your eyes. Sun Woo! [CRIMINAL PROFILING] Seeing a dead person will continue to be difficult. So find something to help you deal with it. What are you doing? It's nothing. Sit down. Have you eaten something? Drink some of this. Drink it. Were you crying? No. I do it too. I do it too. Those beastly detectives down there do it too. We cry often. Who would be okay after seeing a dead person? That's why we have to catch who did it. We're having a hard enough time like this. Imagine how the families feel. The tears they've cried are probably like an ocean. The amount that we could lessen from that is... It's probably this much together. So, with that in mind... With that much preparation, we have to handcuff the culprit. That's our job. Crying can be a good method. Just find a good way to get over it, whatever it is. You've probably only seen pictures. Just a few pictures. Victims' names, jobs, time of death, and location. That's all you know about them, but not me. She was alive just days ago. She comforted me. She smiled at me and she was kind. She just lived her life diligently! I'm sure she can rest in peace now. She died so young, before she could even get married. I was reading the newspaper. Is it true you caught the killer with an item that belonged to Won Kyung? Yes, that's right. If it wasn't for your niece, we wouldn't have caught him. It isn't because of Won Kyung. It's because of Officer Lee that you caught him. Officer Lee? He was the person that Won Kyung liked. We're both civil servants. Just let me off the hook. What? You broke the rules. Give me your license. Gosh, really. Hey, take this. What are you doing? Do you want to add bribery to the list? Just take it, would you? Take what? I need your license! Hey, don't you know who this is? That person has done nothing wrong. You're in violation. So give me your driver's license! Which precinct are you at? Why do you care where? I'm at Youngsan precinct in Gyeonggi. I'm Officer Lee Jae Han. I'm here about a hit-and-run. I need to get their personal information. I was told they really need it. This is a taser. You turn it on like this. Since the world is such a scary place. She said it was the first gift she had ever received. She was as happy as a child. It wasn't even a ring or necklace. "What kind of gift is that?" I had made fun of her about it. About that Officer Lee? Was his name Lee Jae Han? That's correct. Officer Lee Jae Han. That's him. [RESIGNATION] Won Kyung was very conflicted. "What if he doesn't like it?" [MOVIE TICKETS] Officer Lee. It's nothing. Be strong. Wong Kyung liked you a lot, Officer Lee. Though you're not outgoing and not very talkative she said you didn't lower yourself in front of others and always did the right thing. She said that she liked that the most about you. Detective Lee Jae Han. Are you listening? Detective. The Gyeonggi Nambu case... We caught the killer. How? How did you catch him? Did you find evidence? What is it? Where is it? It isn't possible in your time. Even if you find that evidence... the scientific technology back then makes it impossible to arrest him. However, it was because of you that we caught him. You left the evidence for us, Detective. No matter how much technology has developed if we had no evidence, we would have lost him again. You are the one who caught him, Detective. It was late, but... we were able to catch him. Thank you. . - Sir! - Be quiet and serve him well. If you act like a girl and be a nuisance again, you're dead. What did you do for six years? Are you saying it's 1995? Catch the culprit, now! - What happened? - It's kidnapping. - Wow, nice car. - Hey, Eun Ji! I said I would just go there. Wow, this is so good. Who is the robber? It really isn't my dad. Come with me quietly. Just because you solved the Gyeonggi Nambu case, you can act that way? Where do you think you are to act this way? You should have tried to persuade those people. Don't try to lecture me. I don't want to work with you anymore. - Detective, it's Park Hae Young. - Lieutenant, we were wrong. We should never have started these transmissions.
