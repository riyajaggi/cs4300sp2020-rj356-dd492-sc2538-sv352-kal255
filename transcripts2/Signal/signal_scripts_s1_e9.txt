 Even with the statute of limitation, we'll shut it down when things get quiet. Just go along with it. Detective Lee Jae Han? Detective, it's me, Park Hae Young. Which precinct are you in? We caught the culprit because of you, Detective. You caught him, Detective. I think this will be my last transmission. I'm looking for a detective named Lee Jae Han. He's missing?

 Without someone on the inside, it's impossible to set Lee Jae Han up. Detective Lee Jae Han was murdered. What were you doing while your team was acting up like that? You were just some guy stuck in a little town like Injoo. Don't forget that I was the one who brought you here. What about Park Hae Young? Was he suspicious at all? He didn't do anything out of the ordinary. Lieutenant Park? It's me, Lee Jae Han. [EPISODE 9] Why is this... Park Hae Young. Why do you have this, Section Chief? This is...

 What about it? Is it yours or something? You speak as if you know who this belongs to. Do you want to know? It belonged to Detective Lee Jae Han. This was Detective Lee Jae Han's radio? That's right. He carried it everywhere like a good luck charm. The crime scene investigators found it 15 years ago when he went missing. It was found in the area around where his vehicle was found. It had been stored as evidence until recently. It no longer needed to be stored, so it was set to be disposed of. But... How is it that you came to possess this radio? How did you know that I had it? Have you been... keeping tabs on me? Just answer my question. What's your relationship to Detective Lee Jae Han? Why is it that you're looking into his background? Why? Is there a reason why I can't look into Detective Lee Jae Han? Or... Is there a secret regarding his disappearance that I can't know? Regarding the case of his disappearance... there are no secrets at all. Too bad. Pork belly and soju would be perfect right now. We can go for drinks. If you touch my desk again. I won't let it go so easily. As for what belongs to me, I'll be taking it back. The radio that Detective Lee Jae Han carried around like a good luck charm. The night that I discovered it... It was about to be disposed of. Lieutenant Park Hae Young. It's me, Detective Lee Jae Han. Are you there, Lieutenant Park Hae Young? - At that moment... - Who are you? Was it really just a coincidence that this radio fell into my hands? Why is it 11:23 p.m.? Why? Why did it happen to be me? Why? The crime scene investigators found it 15 years ago when he went missing. It was found in the area around where his vehicle was found. Detective Lee Jae Han's disappearance. There's a secret hidden in there somewhere. Why me, and why did these transmissions start? Detective Lee Jae Han went missing and was framed for being a corrupt cop. Someone framed him and planted the evidence. Someone within the police organization. If I can find that person... I'll know how and why Detective Lee Jae Han went missing. Three, four... Yes? Sir, you have a delivery. Here. [AHN CHI SOO] Are you going look at it with me? Get out. Okay. [BACK PARKING LOT HANSUNG BUILDING. 4 P.M. DON'T USE YOUR CELL PHONE.] [I HAVE ORDERS REGARDING LEE JAE HAN.] Gosh, seriously. I thought he wanted me to lay low. Why is he ordering me to come and go? You come when he says and go when he says. You're very loyal. Courier mail service is great. It doesn't get lost. It gets to the person I want at exactly the right time. What are you talking about? So it was Section Chief Ahn Chi Soo? The one who framed Detective Lee Jae Han as being corrupt? Who is Ahn Chi Soo? I don't know that person. Of course, he couldn't have done it alone. The scale of this is too big. Who's behind him? I said I don't know anything. If you want to investigate so badly, go and get yourself a warrant, okay? That's Kim Sung Bum, the one I told you about. There's a rumor that he made a lot of money with a pyramid scheme two years ago. Why are you interested in him? You'll get hurt if you know. Look at those punks. [JINYANG-DONG PYRAMID SCHEME INVESTIGATION REPORT] [KIM BUM JOO] There was over 2 billion won in this fraud case, but not enough evidence? Kim Bum Joo, you punk. You are being pretty bold. This is interesting. Where are you coming from? Why do you want to know? Senior, what are your plans on Christmas? I got these free movie tickets. You can watch it with a friend. Well, the thing is... I'm just giving it to you because I'm thankful for all your help. I don't watch movies. What? I don't watch them. As you were notified starting today, we'll be enforcing strict control over stores in the city. We'll join forces with the precinct in charge, so get ready to be deployed. Any questions? Being that it is the end of the year it is important to close more cases as directed by the bosses. But as people who serve the nation, we should care about people's livelihood. For example, something like this would be good. Six incidents in Gangnam and five in Gangseo. In total, that's 11 incidents. He's mugged that many people. It's not a big case that will bring in any money through back doors. The people are already suffering because of IMF. This is the exact kind of guy we have to put away. Take a look. You want to catch him that badly? This mugger? And if I do? Seriously. Look down. I'm your superior. If you want to get him, go ahead. But only during the day. If you don't come out at night, you'll be reported for disobeying orders. You'll probably be tired, but I'm sure you'll be fine. Of course. You must be busy. Working day and night. And looking into people's backgrounds. Let's get going. Can't you stop being so rebellious? If you just listen to him, he'll make things comfortable. He lets you go home early too. You can live that way. I can't live that way. I'll help you with that mugger later. - Okay? - Let go. I'm going to do it. You know I can't stand to lose. But... Can you see his face? I can't see it at all. How are you going to catch him with this? Give it back. Why you... Does a Violent Crimes detective need a face to catch the culprit? I just need my nature. Go! Get back to work. Hello. Can I ask you a few questions? This type of motorcycle is a Daeyang, right? Have you had anyone come in for repairs recently? Hello, sir. By any chance, do you know this type of motorcycle? Yes. Senior, here you go. See you in my dreams. Wait a minute. This is my rush time for the year. How can you do this now? Sorry, but this is the law. The law is the law, but we have to make money. Should we send all our customers away? This is just too much! That guy... That... that guy! It's... it's... the mugger! Hey, hey! It's the wrong bike, dummy! Where are you going? Hey, wait for me! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, are you crazy? That's what I'm saying. That person is really... The true culprit. What a relief! Let's all give a round of applause to our rookie, okay? What? How did you know anyway? You wouldn't have been able to see his face. I saw him in my dreams. See, I told you that she's totally crazy. Hey, why are you picking on the person who caught the culprit? What about Senior Lee Jae Han? Thanks to him, we obtained a clue and caught Han Se Kyu. I feel thankful, so I want to know about him. I heard that he was with Ahn Chi Soo in Jinyang Precinct. Were the two of them close? Now that I think about it, it's strange. The Kim Yoon Jung case, the Gyeonggi Nambu case and the Han Se Kyu case. All the cases you've shown interests in... How could they all have a tie to Senior Lee Jae Han? Did they? I didn't know that. I don't know about his relationship to Section Chief Ahn Chi Soo. Senior Lee Jae Han... was transferred to Injoo when the incident there first occurred. That's where they first met, I heard. Injoo? Why? Do you know it? It's my hometown. Then you must know about that case. The gang-rape of a female high school student in 1999. That detective investigated that case as well? Yes. He was a member of the investigation team. What's wrong? Ah... it's nothing. Thank you for answering. Park Hae Young's brother, Park Sun Woo, was an ex-convict. What was the crime? Have you heard about the Injoo female high school student case? The case where a female high school student was gang-raped. Park Sun Woo was one of the offenders. He was in the juvenile detention center for a few months, and then got out. Hae Young's family history could have been an issue when he interviewed for the Police University. The committee decided to give him a chance despite his difficult situation. So, Hae Young was accepted. Sun Woo... is he still in Injoo? No. Soon after he got out, he committed suicide. The gang-rape of a female high school student in 1999. That detective investigated that case as well? Yes, he was a member of the investigation team. This is the Cold Case Squad. Is Detective Cha Soo Hyun there? She's not picking up her phone. No, she's out right now. This is her home. I think it's been robbed. What? Are you okay? Yes, the house... - Did you call 911? - The thing is... What happened is... I'm sorry. Be quiet! I told you to be quiet! Well, uh... I thought it was a robber, so I called Soo Hyun and threw a fuss. The kids had made a big mess like this. That's a relief though. It wasn't a robber. I am really sorry though. It's okay. You are really... good looking, now that I'm looking at you again. Ah, yes. Th... thank you. Then, I'll be going now. See you next time. No, you came all this way. Why don't I get you something to drink? It's okay. - Are you okay? - Yes, yes. I'm fine. Don't worry about me. Ma'am, did you hurt your back? Why don't you sit down? What do you mean, "sit down"? I have to clean up this mess. Oh my! What's wrong with me? Oh, that chair. Can you straighten that up? And these dolls here... Can you put them all over there? Just pile them all together. I'll take care of them later. No, this is the one that I treasure. Put it up there like that. And the books too. By the way... Seriously, how old are you? Yes, I'm 27 this year. Oh, that's just right. Just right. Oh right, since things turned out this way can you help me out a little more, just a tiny bit more? Yes. We don't have a man in this house, you see. My second daughter's husband is working in the rural area. He's not useful at all. Oh my, oh my, oh my. You know... Don't you think my Soo Hyun looks extremely young for her age? She gets that from me. What else should I do? That. Starting next year, Soo Hyun will be getting her pension too. Try turning on the light. Oh, look at all this sweat. I better get you a drink. - You must be hungry too. - No, it's... [JINYANG PRECINCT - LEE JAE HAN] [JINYANG PRECINCT - LEE JAE HAN] [1999 - GYEONGGI NAMBU CASE 1995 - LARCENY CASE] [1997 - HONGWON-DONG CASE 1999 - INJOO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT CASE] Here you go. Oh, it's okay. Oh no, take it. Just try eating it. Here. It's so good. How is it? Yes. Gyeonggi Nambu... We're searching the area we think she went missing in. We're following Highway 3 and searching for Lee Gye Sook. Lee Gye Sook... Are you talking about the Gyeonggi Nambu serial murders? Robberies. The culprit of the larceny case of 1995. Who is it? These are all the cases Detective Lee Jae Han and I worked on. The Hongwon-dong case in 1997. [1997 HONGWON-DONG CASE] [OCTOBER 17, 1997] Here. Take your time eating. Excuse me. Yes? Can you help me? What color is he? Is he very hurt? He's white. We better find him quickly. Isn't that it over there? Are you okay? How did this happen to you? I did it. Life is hard, isn't it? You shouldn't live. I'll help you. [NO RESULTS FOR THIS SEARCH TERM.] Over here. I'm going to use the bathroom first. Go ahead without me. Okay. Detective Lee Jae Han? It's me, Park Hae Young. Yes, it's me, Lee Jae Han. Why haven't I heard from you at all? I thought you really threw away your radio. Has your radio made noises during that time? Have you spoken to anyone else besides me? Yes, it did make noises, but no one responded. Why? Is something going on? What year is it there? Is it the year 1995? No, it's the year 1997. It's been two years. If it's 1997, there's still two years before the Injoo case. Detective Lee Jae Han doesn't know Section Chief Ahn Chi Soo yet. He doesn't know about what happens in Injoo either. Then what year is it there? It's still the year 2015. What? It's still the same? If it's the year 1997 are you investigating the Hongwon-dong case? Hongwon-dong? Is something happening in Hongwon-dong? What happens? I don't know yet. I searched on the internet and there isn't a single article. I researched many cases while studying profiling. I had never heard of this then either. You're making me nervous. I get scared every time I get your transmissions. Maybe it becomes a cold case too. I don't know anything for certain. But I am certain that something happened in Hongwon-dong. It was written in your notebook. My notebook? What did it say? There was a memo inserted in the back of your notebook. You had written about the 1989 Gyeonggi Nambu case the 1995 larceny case the 1997 Hongwon-dong case and... the 1999 Injoo female high school student case. I had written that? Are you sure? But how did you get my notebook? How... What about the first person to find the body? Hey, bro. - How have you been? - Hey! What? Have you come to dig out of me now? What do you mean? I came to see how you've been. Yeah right! What's with the confusion here? Is there a case? See, see. No, I'm not curious. Not at all. Is it a big one? A woman died and it is bit odd. What's so odd about it? Let me take a quick look. - Hey now! - Just the pictures, okay? Gosh, what a dog this guy is. Why put a plastic bag on a dead person's head? What about the victim? She lives in the area. She's 37 years old and a housewife. Her name is Joo In Hee. Any suspects? Well, there's the insurance issue for now. I have to look into the family. - Senior, Senior? - Yeah. He's the first person to have found the body. Hey, I have go. Okay, bye. Over this way. Come in. Yes, hello. I'm Detective Lee Han. Can I have just a moment of your time? Just a moment. Yeah, I thought someone threw out a mannequin at first. I never imagined it could be a person. Gosh, my heart still races when I think about that moment. Were there any other witnesses besides you? I don't really know about that. I was just so shocked back then, and I wasn't in my right mind. This is a copycat of that other murder, isn't it? What? You know? That woman who died in the next neighborhood. What are you referring to? A few months ago, in the next neighborhood over a woman was killed with a plastic bag over her head. A friend of mine who works in that area told me he saw it himself. I have something to talk to you about. Don't say it. All right. Hey, you... What is it? Something about the Hongwon-dong murders isn't quite right. This a murder from Hongwon Precinct from a few days ago. The victim is a housewife Joo In Hee, age 37. And this is Yoo Sang Mi, age 21, who worked at a nearby shop. If you take a look, they way their bodies were wrapped is the same. One man killed both women. These killings are serial. There was no report from the precinct. It's one case, but the two precincts are different. The first is Eungchan Precinct and the second is Hongwon Precinct. That's why they aren't connecting the two victims. Do you have evidence? This is all speculation on your part. People have died. If I'm right about this, more people could die. There are so many unnatural deaths in a year. Even though we are the police, how can we stop all of that? Would you say the same thing if these people were Han Se Kyu? If these people were daughters of Congressmen or the wealthy? I'm sure you would run forward with arms wide open. If they were people like that, they wouldn't be victims to these crimes. They'd be living in different worlds. What? No one wants a serial killer, not the Captain or the Superintendent. Don't bring up this nonsense again. I finally get it. You've been living in a different world. What? Like you said... I live in a different world than you do so I'm catching this guy no matter what. Many people die for no reason every year. I will never forgive someone who kills people in front of me. That's the world that I live in! I don't care what you do. Just don't make a big mess while you do it. What are you doing there? I had something to give the Captain. Senior. What? Are these really... serial murders? Don't concern yourself with it. It has nothing to do with you. I heard you found skeletal remains at Donghae Mountain. You came for no reason again. Height is 160 centimeters and it is a petite person. Thanks. She was wrapped up tight. Her body was wrapped in plastic and tied up with rope. Thanks to that, the body was protected well. The cause of death is confirmed too. The hyoid is broken. She died due to pressure to the neck. What's wrong? Are you sick? Let's think about this objectively. What does it mean to be in the Cold Case Squad? We have to look at cases that weren't solved a long time ago. So, what hasn't been solved? Who, what, why, and how did they die? None of that has been exposed. There are these mysterious cases that our nation's history does not know yet. Odaeyang is that case. You and your Odaeyang, every time you open your mouth... Aren't you tired of it? Why would I be tired of Odaeyang? We haven't even started it. I heard about it so much, I feel like we already finished it. I'm saying that before it is too late, we must do Odaeyang... How about Hongwon-dong? Hongwon-dong? Is there a good restaurant there? I've never heard of Hongwon-dong. Me too. What case is that? 1997, Hongwon-dong in Seoul... Within two months and less than one kilometer apart from each other two women were found murdered. The cause of death was asphyxiation. What set him apart... was the way he disposed the bodies. The killer put a black plastic bag over the heads of the women. He would wrap the bodies tightly with rice sacks before disposing them. Wow, this guy is pretty crazy. How did this become a cold case? The initial investigation didn't start off well. Two different precincts were working on the cases. It wasn't possible to look into the fact that they were disposed the same way. There was a question of insurance that came up. The investigation targeted the family. They were all found to be innocent, in the end. If you're correct about this, Detective Cha... wouldn't this be a serial... Don't say it. That's bad luck. It's more than possible that it could be a serial killer. The way he disposes the victim's bodies is a very clear signature. The time and the place of the murders are similar too. But it's too early to arrive at a conclusion. According to the FBI, you need at least three victims. There are cooling-off periods for murders. When the circumstances of the deaths match in separate cases that's when you can conclude it is a serial killer. What if there is one more? Yesterday, on Donghae Mountain... remains were found. Hold on. What is it? It's just dogs. Wait. We're running late. What about her identity? Has it been confirmed? There was a match in the missing person's database. The victim's name is Seo Young Jin. She went missing in 2001. She was 35 when she went missing. Where did she live when she went missing? I heard it was Hongwon-dong. Hongwon-dong? Are you sure? Oh, Detective Cha are you sick again? You didn't look well yesterday either. These aren't even the skeletal remains you've been looking for. What's wrong? It's nothing. Detective Cha's been looking for skeletal remains? You're on the same team and you don't know? She's been looking for someone that's 185 cm with a metal plate in one of the shoulders. We have her identity. We should go. Thank you. She's been looking for someone that's 185 cm with a metal plate in one of the shoulders. Does it make sense that you can't forget someone for 20 years? I suppose you might not. Was there someone you liked? Don't bother imagining things. It's not like that. I told the police everything yesterday. Was there anything strange before your wife went missing? Was she getting threats from anyone, or... She rarely went outside. She had postpartum depression. Postpartum depression? At first, I wondered if she had left and committed suicide. I had no idea she was so nearby. Detective Cha, what is it? Is something wrong? It's the same. The way he murders them. The way he wraps the bodies. The characteristics in the victims. Even in 1997... it was the same. In Hee had a kind of an odd personality. I don't want to say this about the dead, but she never smiled or spoke much. She was always alone. Had she been anxious? Did she mention anything about being followed by anyone? I don't know. She never spoke to me much. I don't really know. She only listened to music in the corner. With those things in her ears. I'm telling you, I wasn't friendly with that woman who died. But you were the only two that worked here. I'm sure you two knew each other. She was hard to get close to. She was boring and a real downer. She never said anything and had no expressions on her face. She always listened to depressing music. Gosh, she really didn't suit me at all. Okay, thank you anyway. Body type, height, age, hair... even their jobs were different. The two victims had nothing in common. The lived in the same area, but their ways to work were different. Their routes didn't overlap anywhere. The only thing they had in common was... the earphones. They both liked to listen to sad music. [HONGWON-DONG MURDER INVESTIGATION REPORT] If I could just find where the victims' movements overlap I'd be halfway there. 500 won. Senior. What are you doing here? I'm... Well... Did you look through my Hongwon-dong files? Are you here trying to figure out the routes of the victims? Hey, don't go around doing things you're not qualified for. Go back and do your own work. - Still... - Hey. I told you to go back, okay? You know the dead victims? I feel bad for them. My goodness. I walked around on all the streets they might have walked on. All that's on the streets are trash and fliers for seedy businesses. All I could see were cold concrete and steel. There was nothing beautiful or alive on the streets. No one was there to listen to my words, and living is hard as it is. But if all they saw was so dark and dreary... I think I'd get depressed too. So just go back in. If you're the mascot, you should act like it. Get back to the office and work before the Section Chief notices. Gosh... What is it? This is a list of missing people from Hongwon-dong from 1997 to 2015. Like the victims from before, there are three that had depression. What are you saying? Seo Young Jin, who was found yesterday, might not be the last one. Please allow us to search that mountain further for more bodies. There could be more victims. Space out in 1 meter intervals and search thoroughly. Yes, sir! You just poked my foot. This is hard. I'm really surprised by all this. Doesn't Section Chief Ahn hate Park Hae Young? That's what I thought. I thought he'd say no for sure. Right? That's what I thought. Are there more bodies here? This was only turned into a hiking spot last year. CCTVs were only put up recently. They didn't even have a caretaker. There was barely anyone around before. Also, the closest place to hike here from is Hongwon-dong where the 1997 murders occurred. If you calculate the time to get here, it's the perfect place to dispose bodies. It's a place that the killer chose very carefully. If there are bodies buried anywhere, it will be here. Detective Cha Soo Hyun, you know something more about this case, right? As for the two murders in 1997 he disposed the bodies in public areas, almost like he was displaying them. But in 2001, he started to bury the bodies. His pattern had changed. What's the reason? You know something, don't you? During the incident in 1997... besides the two murdered victims... there was one more victim. What do you mean? - Hey. - Huh? Is 0.5 back? No, I haven't seen her. You haven't seen her? Hello. Hello, I'm Officer Cha Soo Hyun's senior at work. Yes, hello. I have something urgent to discuss with Officer Cha Soo Hyun. Okay, she's not home yet? No, that's fine. Yes, bye. Yes. What's wrong? Are you hurt? Gosh, where is she? Cha Soo Hyun! 0.5! Gosh... Living is really tough, right? You can't take it off. You'll get in trouble then. Wait just a bit. I'll make you comfortable. Cha Soo Hyun! Hey, Cha Soo Hyun. Hey... hey! Pull yourself together... Hey, you! Cha Soo... Cha Soo... Wake up! Come on, kid! Cha Soo Hyun, look at me! Hey, hey! Look at me! Cha Soo Hyun, hey! Wake up! Hey, Cha Soo Hyun... Soo Hyun. Cha Soo Hyun. Hey! Hey, Cha Soo Hyun! Cha Soo Hyun... Cha... Cha Soo Hyun, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Cha Soo Hyun, hey, hey. Hey, it's all right. I was late. I'm sorry. You did well. You did really well. You did good. Good job. Everything's okay now. It's okay. Your senior was late. I'm sorry. I really thought... it was all over. Because after that... there were no other victims. We found something! There's something here! Get over here, quick. - It's here. - Okay. - Where? - Over here! Move, move, move! Excuse me. There's something weird over there too. - Wow! - Over here! Get over there! You found more victims? But it's not just three. What is all of this? Including the remains we found yesterday... there are nine in total. There's a very high probability that the same killer buried them all. The likely suspect is the same culprit in the 1997 Hongwon-dong murders. That killer had not stopped killing. Cha Soo Hyun! - Let's rest and continue later. - Come out. - Where are you going? - To kill that son of a bitch. What are you going to do about this situation? Why did you let this happen when you knew about it? Aren't you getting rid of the Cold Case Squad? You're closing the case? What's this about? You know Cha Soo Hyun? She's a team leader? Cha Soo Hyun? 0.5? I don't know... Mom, Soo Hyun's weird! She must be sick. I can't do that. It can't even be stopped. Give it up. That case is done. If we make the wrong move, a person's life could be ruined. Why not let the Cold Case Squad take over this case? - Let's do it together. - Do I look like a child to you? If you find this woman, you'll find a lead to the killer. I'll try one more time. I have to catch him in order for this nightmare to end.
