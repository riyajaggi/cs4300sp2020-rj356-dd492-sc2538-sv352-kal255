 Eun... Eun Ji! I told you I'd just go home. Oh wow, this is good. I think of you as my real uncle. Who is the culprit of the burglary? Catch the culprit before our Precinct Chief gets fired. - It's really not my dad. - Let's go in quietly. Go on home first. You trust me, right? Detective, are you listening? What exactly happened? The past has changed with the larceny case. Eun Ji!

 The gas is leaking. We have no time! You have to save one of them! There will be an explosion! No, no! You have to move fast. It's dangerous! No, Eun Ji! No! It's crazy over here. - What's going on? - It's a kidnapping. How does it feel watching your daughter die? A truck. A refrigeration truck. Compared to my 20 years, it's too short for you. Detective Cha, no! Soo Hyun...

 The transmissions will come again. I need to find out before then. There never was anyone to begin with, so are you the burglar? What color did you say the car was? Red, why? I think I can catch him. No, I'm going to catch him for sure. You're dead now. [EPISODE 7] How do you catch a rat that's hiding deep inside its home? Oh my, why is a young man's car so darn big? It's the size of my bathroom. What do you want? Where's the other car? Not this one. Rich people don't only have one car. This is the only one. I heard he has another flashy one, not this black one. A red one. How many times do I have to tell you? This is the only car. Han Se Kyu is rich and has backings, so we won't get an arrest warrant. But it also means he's a fearful rat who doesn't know much about the world. If you poke at him a bit, he will come running out. You're right, Detective. Your opponent is an amateur. He wouldn't have hidden it well. The house is too dangerous, so that can't be it. There's a high probability it's a place accessible only to him and not others. A place accessible only to him and not to others... One that's always easy for him to access. As well as a place where he can store the stolen items. His car. I don't know anything. I only did what my boss told me to. Open it. Wow. Get out. Here, I have a witness and evidence. This should be enough for a warrant whether he's the chief prosecutor's son or not, right? Han Se Kyu. You are under arrest for the Gaesu-dong larcenies. You have the right to remain silent and the right to legal counsel. Even with a father who knows the law, it will be hard to get out of this. Your fingerprints were found all over the stolen items. Reporting now on the larceny case that has had the nation talking. The police have arrested another suspect for these crimes. The suspect is the son of the chief prosecutor. He had a close relationship with the households that were robbed. He used that relationship in order to commit the crimes. This has come as a shock to many. Ever since Mr. Oh's wrongful arrest, my client Mr. Han has been fasting. Due to his conscience, he was going to turn himself in but ended up being arrested. The victims do want compensation for the crimes. Taking into consideration that his actions were motivated by the curiosity of a young man I believe that the court will come to a fair decision. How ridiculous. Why would you look for an espresso machine at a karaoke place? Why in the world would they not have an espresso machine? Be quiet. You don't know the importance of espresso machines. Gosh, look at this. We really should do the Oh Dae Yang case. Where's Detective Cha Soo Hyun? Detective Cha Soo Hyun... Who's there? Who are you? Hello. I work with Detective Cha Soo Hyun in the Seoul Metropolitan cold case squad. My name is Park Hae Young. So, you're Soo Hyun's co-worker? Yes. Okay, come in. Yes, come in. Why don't you wait over there? Do you want coffee or tea? - Anything is fine. - Okay, sit down. What? Haven't you seen a sick person before? Detective Cha Soo Hyun took a sick day. You were there. I'll be right back. Go to the night duty room and take a nap. See, that's why we need an espresso machine. We need to take this opportunity as the cold case squad. Let's buy an espresso machine. Let's do Oh Dae Yang. Rock, paper, scissors! All right, all right. Go inside. Play in the room. Rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors! They're a handful, aren't they? They're so noisy. You know... It's the first time that a co-worker of Soo Hyun's has visited. - I see. - Here, drink this. By the way, how old are you? Why are you curious about that? Why are you getting dressed? If someone from work came here, it must mean they're really busy. - No, that's not it. - Hey... Let's go. Hey, you're sick. Where do you think you're going? He must be here because something's not going well. Ah... yes. There's something very important we need Detective Cha Soo Hyun for. Okay, but... Seriously, how old are you? Let's just go. Ouch. Why do you keep looking at me? Are you all right? Wouldn't it be better to rest some more? Did that look like resting to you? What now? Have you ever regretted it? It's dangerous being a cop. What's up with you today? You deal with criminals everyday. You can't get married and live a normal life... That's all fine with me. Just let me off over by the sauna place. - What? - Turn over there and let me off. Don't slack off because I'm not around. Prepare an investigation strategy for the case you want to tackle next. Han Se Kyu was found guilty of his crimes for the larceny case. But he was a first-time offender. Taking into account that he was deeply remorseful of his actions after he spent six months in jail he was released with a two-year probation. [EX-CONVICT WITH A HANYOUNG BRIDGE GRUDGE MURDERS OFFICE WORKER] I did a useless thing. If I knew you would kill someone and come back in here... I wouldn't have cleared your name. That man... He got the punishment he deserved. Now, I'll get my punishment. You're the only one like this. Everything is back to its right place. So why are you the only one still like this? Why are you so stupid? The bad guys have completely forgotten everything. They're going to live just fine from now on. Why? Why are you living like this? Why are you doing this? Gosh... There's a prisoner named Oh Kyung Tae who died here. Over here. [OH KYUNG TAE, 1958 - 2005] [PARK SUN WOO MAY 31, 1983 TO FEBRUARY 18, 2000] There's no tombstone or anything. Is this it? With people who have no family, this is all that we can do. Even though the past changes, there are some things that don't change. It's because the world is unfair. Where's the Chief? I couldn't get in touch with him all day. Hey, come here. Han Se Kyu says it was just curiosity. What kind of crazy person robs three houses out of curiosity? That's not all. There are stolen items not found yet. The prosecutors aren't even investigating and are just letting it go. - Where's the Chief? - It's not the time for that. Chief. What's going on with this? Does this make any sense? What are you doing right now? We go where we are told to go. What is it? What did you do wrong that they would chase you out without notice? Be quiet. Haven't you seen a person getting transferred before? It's Han Se Kyu, isn't it? There's something more to him, right? He wouldn't do something like this out of mere curiosity. There's another real reason, isn't there? You know Jinyang, don't you? Yes, it's a new city area that's being constructed at the moment. You know the Hanyoung Bridge investigations team? They were looking into Sekang Construction who built the bridge. In the development of Jinyang... there was massive corruption found between the Chaebols and the government. They say the money exchanged between them is staggering. They say that houses robbed all have something to do with that. More importantly... I don't know if Han Se Kyu knew about it or if he was just happened upon it... But among the items that he stole there is a crucial piece of evidence that can reveal that corruption. But none of that was revealed and the prosecution closed the investigation. So just pretend you don't know anything and sit this out. This case is not for some detective like you to butt into. - But still... - I see you're still here. Ah... you're here already. Oh, say hello. This is Chief Kim Bum Joo who is going to replace me. All right, say hello everyone. This is Chief Kim Bum Joo. Take good care of my guys. You're getting kicked out because you couldn't watch over your men. Yet, you ask me to take care of them. You're going through this because you're so soft. Don't you worry. I'll definitely watch over your guys. Are you Lee Jae Han? I really hate guys like that. A total lowlife who shows off and acts like he's the only one who knows anything. One bad seed like that... dirties up the entire water. Gosh, this crappy world. I try to leave it alone, but it won't leave me be. This stinks too much. I ought to be getting an award for catching Han Se Kyu. They get rid of the Chief right at the appropriate time. Then some hunting dog of theirs comes to replace him. They really must have something to hide. Don't worry. I will be acting up much more than you expect. Natural pearl white gold bracelet. Okay. A pair of diamond earrings. Are these it? Blue diamond necklace. - Blue diamond necklace? - Blue diamond? - What is this? - It's not here? It's not here. [WHO?] But among the items that Han Se Kyu stole there is a crucial piece of evidence that can reveal that corruption. The missing item was taken from Congressman Jang Young Chul. The blue diamond necklace. It's been a month since you've been home, hasn't it? Please remember. As for Congressman Jang Young Chul and the other elders they only made this agreement in return for those missing stolen items. I'm sure you know this already. You cannot disclose this to anyone else. He's coming out. I'm Shin Dong Yoon from MBS. Han Se Kyu has been released today on suspended sentence. Some people believe the punishment is not enough. What do you think? Tell us what you think as a victim of these burglaries. I'm sure that the judiciary department made wise decisions. Please move. I'm sure you suffered a lot. Have you really forgiven him? Have you found the missing items? I'm Detective Lee Jae Han from the Seoul Violent Crimes. You made an agreement with him even though you didn't get them back. He has a very big heart. Move out of the way please. - What is this? - Please answer us. Congressman! - Congressman, Congressman! - Out of the way. Wait, let go of me. Congressman! Congressman! Why just Han Se Kyu? It would have been great if you could have had that mercy on Oh Kyung Tae too. Or did you have to let Han Se Kyu go because of that diamond necklace? You're working very hard. Just one question, sir. Congressman! Congressman, wait! Just one word, Congressman. Why are you here when it's so cold? Then why are you out here? How is your cold? Don't make a big deal over a cold. It's embarrassing. Take good care of your health. Don't get sick or hurt. You have to take care of yourself at that age in order for someone to marry you. You want to die? I'm just kidding. Do you remember what I said before? About what? What if you got a transmission from the past? I asked you what you would do. You said this back then. Rather than not trying and regretting... it's better to try, even if you ruin everything. But... I don't think that's right. I don't think it's good to get a transmission like that. It really can... ruin everything. Lieutenant Park. It's me, Lee Jae Han. Lieutenant, are you listening? Han Se Kyu has been arrested. I know that. But that's not all. Han Se didn't do it out of curiosity. A stolen item is missing. It's a diamond necklace. There's a bigger secret hidden there. Detective... You said it before. That these transmissions shouldn't have started. Lieutenant. I don't know why they started. And I don't know why it's between the two of us. I think it's right that we stop now. What do you mean by that? We can't change the world with what we're doing, right? We just bring chaos. It was like that this time. A cop who had nothing to do with this nearly died. Hold on. I'm sure you know. Tell me where the missing items are. Look what happened to Kyung Tae because of Han Se Kyu. Please take care of yourself. Lieutenant, Lieutenant! I don't know what went wrong with these transmissions. But if someone committed a crime whether you have money or power... you have to get the punishment that you deserve. That's the job of a cop! Lieu... Lieutenant! [INVESTIGATION ON DETECTIVE LEE JAE HAN OF JINYANG PRECINCT VIOLENT CRIMES] Hey, 0.5. I haven't heard that in so long. It's nice to hear. Should we talk about the past? That radio that Detective Lee Jae Han carried around like a good luck charm... You remember it, right? You stuck that yellow smile sticker on it, didn't you? - 0.5, are you ready? - Yes. - Let's go. - Let's go. Oh, we're moving! Hey! I'll try again. Hey! - Okay. - All right. Take your foot off the clutch and press the accelerator. - Off the clutch, okay? Okay? - Yes, yes. I'll try it again. Yeah, going again. Turn the wheel. Oh... Stop, stop! - Brake! - Brake! You almost crashed into that. Sorry. Pull back. Back out. I said back. Back, you said? - Stop moving. - Okay, stop. Side. Side. Get out. He's angry now. He really is. One, two. One, two. One, two. - Get in. - Okay. Don't laugh. - Focus now. - Yes. - Go now. - Let's go. They're off now. Oh, not bad. They're going... Hey... hey! Yes? What? 0.5? You're not even 0.3. Wow, get rid of her. There's nothing we can do about her. But she's pretty. Look... look at that. She can't even drive the car. How can she be in Violent Crimes? She can get a driver. Is she some rich madam? I thought we were taking turns teaching her. Why is it always me? You're the best driver. I don't know about that, but practicing with her is... Oh, hey, car, car! Hey, hey! Move! Hey, hey! Get out of there! There's a meeting today, right? - Yes. - What time is it? It's starting right away. Oh, thank you. Here's coffee for you. Here's some coffee for you. It has two sugars and cream. I only drink canned coffee. And are you some sort lady who works in a cafe? You say you want a detective. Why are you handing out coffee instead of preparing the investigation? - Hey. - Who are you trying to look good for? Get your act together. Okay? - Give me that, would you? - Hold on. The M.O. and the traits are all there. But we don't have the location, so we can't make an arrest yet. I see. I know I can figure this out. [THANK FOR DRIVING SO MANY TIMES.] Did he not trade this in? Hey, don't touch that. It's Jae Han's good luck charm. His good luck charm? Why are you asking about that radio anyway? You're famous at the National Forensics Service. You run over whenever they get skeletal remains. But... You're not the only one looking for Lee Jae Han. What? Park Hae Young has been digging into Lee Jae Han. Park Hae Young? He asked me exactly like this. If I know about Detective Lee Jae Han from Jinyang Precinct. How would Park Hae Young know him? No one from his family is connected to Lee Jae Han. Park Hae Young was a child just over ten when Lee Jae Han went missing. So, they wouldn't have met. Also, Park Hae Young made a request to Human Resources. And he secretly took Detective Lee Jae Han's service record files. If they knew one another, he wouldn't have needed to do that. They don't know each other and have no connection. Yet, he keeps digging into Detective Lee Jae Han. It's very strange. A team leader should know more about her team member. - Hi. - Hello. Oh, you smell like alcohol. Do you wash your face with it? There's a place out front that makes good cream pasta. Should we have cream pasta for lunch? Gosh, that makes me sick. Don't talk about cream to me. Especially for a guy who looks like he could beat a cow to death. Let's have some stew so I can get over this hangover. What about beef cavity stew? You're a strange guy. You even like to eat bloody things. Just go to dig into an ashtray. It's good for hangovers. I just can't deal with you because you're not on my level. How about you, Profiler Park Hae Young? Why bother asking? He always eats alone. Like a dignified person. I like omelet rice. - Omelet? - What? Why? You don't like omelet rice? You like it with ketchup too? Hi, Detective Cha. You're here? I was waiting for you. I've prepared a lot on Oh Dae Yang. Park Hae Young. You... Is this the cold case squad? Yes, it is. Detective Cha Soo Hyun. Who are you? I met you a long time ago, but I see you don't remember me. It was 20 years ago with a male detective. It was a detective named Lee Jae Han. Detective Lee Jae Han? Why? Do you know him? Ah... he has the same name as a detective that I know. It seems like you have something to say. You should sit down and talk. I saw you on TV a short while ago. You solved the Gyeonggi Nambu case. Yes, I did. No matter how I thought about it I couldn't think of anyone else to ask this of but you, Detective. This is my fiancee who died 20 years ago. Her name is Shin Da Hye. Oh my, she was beautiful. What did she do? She was an aspiring actress. Okay... I met her when I worked as an assistant in a studio. Hey, let's go to four and five. Hey... hey! What are you doing? - Pull yourself together. - Sorry. - Prepare it now. - Yes. Those were difficult times. Still, she was someone who lived life very hard. But she suddenly committed suicide. She left a suicide note and she was found in the lake. And? Why have you come to me? Help me find this woman. Oh, okay. Wait, what? You want to find someone who died 20 years ago? Yes, Da Hye committed suicide 20 years ago. That's what I believed too. This is the photo I took 20 years ago on the last day we were together. It was a cafe we went to together often on our dates. Da Hye! Even after that happened to Da Hye... I went there every now and then. It had worn out quite a bit in 20 years. Still, that cafe stood in that same spot. A few days ago, like an old habit... I went back to that place. This is a photo I took there just a few days ago. I think that Da Hye is alive. Da Hye... Please find this woman. I'm asking you. A young woman came to a jeweler's a few days ago with a diamond necklace. A big tear-drop necklace. I thought it could be that missing stolen item. It's this item here. Yes, it's this necklace. Who brought it? She was about 20. Yes, she was a young lady about 20 years old. A 20 year old woman. You have CCTV's here, right? I'll take a look at it. Ah, that's her. - This one here? - Yes. Hello. Ah... I... I want to sell this. Miss, where did you get this? I got it as a gift. Your boyfriend must be very wealthy. But why would you want to sell it? You don't have to buy it if you're not interested. No, wait. I'll give you eight. Eight... 8 million won? Miss, you really don't know much about this, do you? You should be getting at least 80 million won for this. Wait, what is this thing here? - What? - This black thing here. Oh, this? It came out of the case. This came out of here. That's a floppy disk, right? A floppy disk. Floppy disk... In the development of Jinyang... there was massive corruption found between the Chaebols and the government. Among the items that Han Se Kyu stole there is a crucial piece of evidence that can reveal that corruption. Do you have this here, or did she take it? Yes. Then did she leave anything? Like her contact info? She did leave her contact information. But that number doesn't exist. It doesn't exist? That's right. Oh. I did think that it was probably fake. And that it doesn't exist. If someone brings in something like that. [JUNG HAE YOUNG] they're unlikely to give real info. Yes, we should... Kim Bum Joo, that punk. Sir, I'll take this contact information. Can you delete the CCTV footage? Okay. These are the files that were sent here. Stop talking about the files, and just go and catch them. So useless. Gosh... Are you all even working? - 0.5 - Yes? Come out to the parking lot. Let's practice driving. Yes. No one cares if you're not at your desk, right? Is that really true? There's a phone in the female's night duty room, isn't there? Yes, there is. Why do you ask? I need to find a phone number. Well, you can look at this later. The last two numbers of the number I'm looking for is probably different. Try calling all of them. You need to find a household where a young woman in her 20s lives. Is that all? Hey! Why? Can't you do it? No. Her real number is different, and she's in her 20s. That's more than enough information. This is an investigation between just you and I. Yes. Yes, this is a sauna? How old is your grandchild? 24 years old? Oh, but he's a grandson? Oh, hey kid. Thank you. How about an auntie? It's nothing. Thank you. No, no. It's not a prank call. Don't hang up! Wow! I found them. Out of the hundred numbers I tried, 24 were families. Only five of them had young women in their 20s. Okay, then should we head out. - Me? - Hey, handle! Look forward. Hey, I told you to stay in the car. I'm the one who found her. I want to at least see the face of the person we're looking for. Who are we looking for anyway? Please help me out. Gosh, he's still a young guy. I hear that even young people get dementia. Maybe we should have referred him to a good hospital. The photo did look a lot like his dead fiancee. Depending how the photo was taken and the angle a person who looks completely different can look very similar. Yeah, and that's not it. Does it make sense not to forget a person for over 20 years? Maybe if that person hadn't paid back money for that long. You could not forget. How could you not? Just like buses, women come by every five minutes. - Don't be like that. - What? And you don't be like that either. - What? - I mean this case. I totally oppose it. I oppose too. The body has been cremated already. - Yes. - There's no scientific evidence. There could be evidence left at the cafe in the photo. Why are you doing this again? So many people are in and out of there. How could there be any evidence left? We can't know that without looking. Just forget about that. Let's not get involved in other people's love life. Let's do this Oh Dae Yang case. This is a cold case. If what that man said is true the identity of the body in the lake is still unknown. Then this is a cold case too. We're just not communicating. Park Hae Young, you're against this right? Of course, he is. A case about love doesn't suit younger kids these days. How do you know Detective Lee Jae Han? Why are you interested in one of my seniors? Senior? I worked with him in the past. [EMPLOYEE DISCHARGED] Why did you go to that woman's funeral? Are you interrogating me? I'm asking because of this case. Why did you go to Shin Da Hye's house? It was probably because of an investigation, right? I don't know the details. He said he was looking for stolen items. Stolen items? Did you ask him which ones? He was looking for a blue diamond. A stolen item is missing. It's a diamond necklace. There's a bigger secret hidden there. Detective Lee Jae Han had been looking for it on his own the whole time. This case is connected to Han Se Kyu. Why do you keep asking questions and making me nervous? By any chance, was that after Han Se Kyu was arrested? That's right. You're not going to take this case, right? I'll tidy up a bit. Let's do it. Should we vote? I vote yes. - I say no. - Me too. - I vote yes. - So, it's two on two. It's over. Well, can I say yes too? Who are you to vote yes? He's the 0.5. It's now 2.5 to 2. I'll meet the family. Jung Hun Ki, go look for evidence. Senior, go through Shin Da Hye's finances. I need to see you. Hwang Eui Kyung, get over here. Get over here. I'm sorry. Ouch. What is it? I told you that I don't work with people who keep secrets. So tell me honestly. Gosh, here we go again. How do you know Lee Jae Han? I already told you. He has the same name as someone I know. So you're going to meet Shin Da Hye's family. I should go meet the detective who was on the case. I'll get going then. See you later. Don't skip your meals. He asked me exactly like this. If I know about Detective Lee Jae Han from Jinyang Precinct. You were the detective on the cases of unnatural deaths? What brings the cold case squad here? We've started a new investigation and I had a few questions to ask. The location you found the body was a fishing area. There was a resident ID card in the pocket of the body. Was that how you ID'ed the body? It's just as how it's written. The damage to the body must have been severe. How was the family able to confirm that it was their family member? The clothes she was wearing and the items she had were definitely hers. There is one thing I don't understand. She lived in Seoul. That's an hour and a half away from Yeokyung. But she wore her pajamas and a jacket, and came all the way here? Yes, that's what I thought was odd. I thought it might not be suicide. I suggested an autopsy. But the family very forcefully rejected the idea of an autopsy. Her family? You still live with your mother? Yes. I would like to meet your mother. I could go to your place. My mother is very unwell, so she's in the hospital. Then can I visit her in the hospital for a bit? That won't work. She's not doing very well and she's in the intensive care unit. You were the one who confirmed Shin Da Hye's body? How were you certain that was Shin Da Hye? The height and hair length were all similar to my little sister. It was my sister's clothes too. By any chance... could I see belongings that Shin Da Hye has left behind? No. - We burned everything. - What? Her belongings? Everything? Yes. Because my mother was having such a hard time. I'm sorry I couldn't help you. It wasn't suicide. Most suicides are done in locations with emotional ties or locations that make it easy. But Shin Da Hye had no ties to Mikang Lake. And if she thought of suicide and did go to the lake it wouldn't have been on a whim, but something she planned out. But she was in her pajamas. From one to ten, nothing makes sense. Perhaps... There is a good chance that someone killed Shin Da Hye and made it look like a suicide. Even her own family. The detective pushed for an autopsy. The family was firm in their rejection. I'm certain that they're hiding something. [JUNG HUN KI] What happened? I checked the table and all the chairs. There are many overlapping fingerprints, so I'm not getting anything. I told you, didn't I? Nothing would come of this. Are you going somewhere? What brings you here? I really didn't know there were any stolen goods here. You know her, right? What's her relationship with Han Se Kyu? She had the stolen items that Han Se Kyu stole. She hangs around this cabin, right? Is she Se Kyu's girlfriend? That awful kid? Do you think he'd have a girlfriend? He was just playing around with her. Oh, you're here. Oh, get in. Are you okay? You don't know how dirty those young kids were. I got so sick from cleaning up after them. Did they come after that? Even after the burglary case, did they come back? She came back once, alone. Alone? That was when Shin Da Hye took those stolen items. Did you check everything? I did the table and all four chairs. I even looked at all the dust that fell on the floor. There's nothing. Excuse me, does this book belong to this store? No, a customer left that behind. Oh right, that lady who sat there left it behind. Be careful. [MATCHING] That man was right. The key to this case... She's holding it. Shin Da Hye... is not dead. How will we find a woman who's been hiding for 20 years? I killed her. What are you going to do? It's not just anyone. It's Han Se Kyu. How does it feel to get bit by a dog? Let's see if I win or if that dog wins. I don't remember 20 years ago. Should I handcuff you so that you remember? Do I have to worry about this? You didn't watch the cold case team? What were you doing? I ordered the investigation. Did you find a floppy disk in her belongings? You said the same thing as the detective. What about my fiancee? Have you found Da Hye? I won't ever leave you alone. You dare to do this to me? Huh! It's now time to make a statement on what you did in that house.
