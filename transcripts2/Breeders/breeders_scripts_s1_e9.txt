 - Where is she? - Any second now. - Paul... - Hey, Carl. - Is Ally back from Berlin today? - Hope so. This damn war. Sorry? Nothing. I was just being light-hearted and a bit... - Not racist. - No, not racist. Ironically xenophobic. Gosh, it must be hard for you. Summer holiday, single parent. No. No, actually, no. We're copin... more than coping, we are managing. Good for you. That's the spirit. Absolute twat. - Is that Mummy's taxi? - Hang on. It could be, could be.

 - Hello, I recognize that face. - Hello. - Hello, there's Mummy. - Hi! - Thanks, mate. - Hi! Mummy! - What a welcome. Hi, guys. - I got the Kids' Club behavior star! I know. Daddy texted me. - Come here, you. - Hi. That's brilliant. - I'm a house. - Are you? That is fantastic. - Did you get a behavior star? - No, but I'm also a house. Go and get that picture that you did of Mummy. - Hi. - Hey, you all right? - Missed you. - I missed you, too. - I've got a stew on. - Oh, no. What about? I thought... Sorry, I thought it was a phrase

 meaning that you were angry about something. No, I mean I've got... I've made a stew. There's a beef stew that's... Brilliant. I'm starving. When have I ever said that to mean I'm in a mood? I've never said that. No, I was being stupid. My mind is elsewhere. - Is it? - No, it isn't. My mind it's... my mind is right here. It was just an expression. - Okay. How's work? - Let's not talk about work. Okay. See you next Saturday. Okay, I love you so much. But we can have a Skype dinner again. That's always fun. That's nice, isn't it? Shall we? Maybe I should get a plane tomorrow instead. No, you can't. It's work. These two will be fine. - This is all temporary, hon. Just go. - Okay. Bye. I love you. - I love you. - Be safe, please. Oh, man. Should we try going back to our own beds now? - No. - Okay. Please go to sleep. - Oh, dear. - You off? Yeah, I need to leave a bit earlier today, if that's okay. Child care. - Sure, it's fine. - I mentioned it to Helen. Ally's away. It's the kids' holiday. - It's totally fine, Paul. - Okay. - You're taking a couple of days leave? - Yeah, but if that's a huge problem... It's not a problem. Take Monday off, too, if you need to, and Tuesday if it helps. Right, okay. Things won't suffer if I'm not here? - No, shouldn't think so. - Right, okay. Thanks. Good news. Or as they say here... gut... news. - What is it? Erstklassige Werbung have signed on the dotted bloody line. This is massive. That's brilliant. This is a contract that you could see from space. If it were printed. It's actually a PDF with e-signatures, but it cements us here for the next three years. I am very happy. I am once, twice, three times a very happy man. - Me too. - Sorry, sorry. Inappropriate. No, I didn't mean "hashtag me too." I meant I am happy. Me too. - I'm happy, too. - Gut. Good weekend? - How's home? - Brief. Got home at 1:00 on Saturday, and I left at 7:00 p.m. on Sunday, so... - Have you been home yet? - No. Right. Is Karen gonna visit at all or... No, she has Pilates on Mondays and Fridays, so it never quite works out. Right. Sorry, Darren. When you say that this contract cements us here for the next... Three years. You don't mean that I'll have to spend my weekdays here for that long, do you? - Because I just can't. - We can work something out. 'Cause I thought this situation was for two months, tops. We can get something in place that means everyone's happy. I really can't be away from my kids like this for much longer, Darren. You do need to understand that. I'd love to be a sociopath, but I'm not. - That is understood. - Okay. - Good. - Got it. I'll call Diedrich, and we'll get some big brains working on how we move forward, and my tiny brain. - Good. - Although I did get 2:1. - Here he is. - How are they, Dad? - Still very painful. - Can't find it. Oh, the kids... Yeah, fine. Not too bad. They don't half miss their mum, Paul. Children need a mother. Yeah, they still got their mother. She's in Berlin, not Heaven. Now, you have remembered we're gonna see David and Anne in Brighton. - Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. - Yes, so you can't babysit. That's absolutely fine. I've booked a couple of days holiday. - Do you remember David and Anne? - Yep. Yes, I do, yeah. I worked with David at Watneys in the '70s. Jet-black hair. Yeah, no, like I said, I remember him. And I got to know Anne through Dad's friendship with David. Yeah, it's David and Anne. I remember them, yeah. David had a late-stage circumcision in his 40s. I took the cups. - You should probably get going. - Yeah, yeah, we'll skedaddle. Yeah, buses are nice and empty this time of day. Cheers, Mum. - See you, darling. - Thank you so much. - All right, son. - Hey, say bye-bye. - Bye! - Not to me, bell-end, him. - I want to see Mum. - Go to sleep, Luke, please. Go to sleep. - Daddy, can I be in your bed? - Right. No, I understand. It's happened for the past three weekends, right? Yeah, I get it. They don't sleep Sunday night or Monday night, and it's murder for them and for me. - I get it. - Then they get back to normal, right? Then Saturday lunchtime, you're back. And then Sunday night, you're gone, and it just starts over again. I know, yeah. I really miss you, but sometimes your coming back is as disruptive as you being away, you know? So I guess I should stay here this weekend, then. - Fuck, I'm so sorry. - I'm sorry, too. I'm just at the end of my tether, babe. I've already been through about nine tethers already. Have you got a stew on? I have got a right stew on, actually, yeah. All right, speak tomorrow. Go and get some car sleep, okay? - Night, night. - Good night, babe. Thanks, mate. Hey, mate. Can I have two Kablamol, please? - Sure, mate. - Cheers. - Two pound. - Thanks a lot. Drugs are not the answer, Paul. Caffeine can't save you. - Daniel. - Hello, mate. Fuck. Finances, touch wood in place, contracts are getting signed. We're looking to crew up soon. And we start hiring in the next month or so. That is brilliant. I'm so pleased for you. If you hadn't been my case worker when I was 14, Paul, God knows where I'd be right now. Come on. It was the team, wasn't it? Yeah, sure it was the team, but it was you leading that team. - Well, thanks. - Inspiring everyone, inspiring me. And now I'm about to run my own think tank, which back then would have been... - Unthinkable. - Right, unthink-tank-able. - That's better, yeah. - You made such a difference, man. That's nice of you to say. Thank you. Got to be honest, at the moment, I sort of feel like I'm treading water. It's like they don't even really need me at work anymore. Why don't you come join us in this new venture? - Me? - Yes, you. We can make it worth your while financially. Look, it's exciting. It's new. And your energy would be perfect for it. Look, mull it over. A quick meet-up on Friday afternoon? Friday? - Problem? - No, Friday's good. Good. I'll email details. Same address? Yeah, same work email since they invented email, yeah. - Even my home one is AOL. - Classic. - I'll see you Friday, man. - Yeah, nice to see you, mate. - I don't like Kids' Club. - It'll be great. You both love Kids' Club. It's fun. So, listen, if this think-tank job starts in a month or two, then your Berlin commitment will be much less by then, right? - Right, yeah. Yeah. - Okay, so it's ideal. - I don't want to go to Kids' Club. - Mate, I've got a meeting. Granny and Granddad are in Brighton. Leah is... Leah. So you can do a couple of hours at Kids' Club, all right? You enjoy it. They spell Kids' Club with an apostrophe before the S. I know they do, hon, and I would love to point it out, but then they would hate me, and I really need to dump them there for a couple of hours while I meet Daniel. - "Dump"? - Not dump. - Place carefully, like a precious vase. - I don't feel well. I'm hot. That's 'cause you've been running about. - Is Luke not feeling well? - He's a bit warm. Oh, careful. I've had this with Kids' Club before. They won't let them stay if their temperature is over a certain number. I'll stick some frozen peas on his forehead. I feel sick. And my head aches. But what you need is some fun activities to take your mind off it. It's some kind of club for kids, right? I've got to go, hon. See you soon. Bye-bye. All right, stay there. I'll get some peas. - Can we shut the windows? I'm cold. - No, it's fine, babe. People traveled like this for thousands of years on carts and wagons. - You feeling less hot now, mate? - Maybe. Good. Two more for you here. Yes, just to check again to tick the boxes, any food allergies? Nope, they're normal. You could put them in a bath of peanuts and prawns, and they'd be fine. Not fine. Distressed, but healthy. Are you guys ready to have some fun? - They are, yeah. - I feel a bit hot again. - Do you? - No, I don't think so. He's not hot. May I just... I'm afraid we can't take a child with a fever. Come on, that's not a fever. You get delirious with a fever. - That's just a naturally hot head. - One second. Mate, can you try and be a bit less warm, please? Is that possible? - I'll try. - Good boy. Luke, can I just pop this in your ear for a second there, please? It'll be a normal temperature, whatever normal is. Is it 36? It'll be a normal 36, I imagine. Daniel, it sounds like a fantastic project. We like to say it's not just a think tank. It's an action tank. We want to shake up the entire area of public policy around street crime, knives, gang culture. - That's great. - Change the narrative. - Reboot the whole system. - That's so exciting. - Sorry again about... - No worries. A bit pushed for child care today. It's not usually a problem. Understood. Is there anything you'd like to ask about what we're hoping to do? - Yeah, I... - Dad. One second, darling. I saw this piece in "Prospect," I don't know if you saw it, about creating belonging for kids... - Daddy. - Shush, mate. Kids who are vulnerable to gang culture, making sure that there's a network of... I feel a bit sick. Wonder which is your room. Are you in there, Ally? Hello. In your nightie. Though it's from last September, so it'll be some fat bloke cutting his toenails. Fuck, yes. Fucking beauty. Morning, kiddy-winks. I know I'm late starting breakfast, but it's Saturday, so shoot me. There she is. Morning, darling. You all right? - Is Mummy coming back today? - No... We talked about this. This weekend Mummy's gonna stay in Germany, but we can FaceTime. Why don't me and you be a team? Like two New York cops. - What's cops? - Policemen, policewomen. Listen, I'm just going outside for a little standstill, all right? Cigarette? No. See, the cigarette's just a MacGuffin. It's the standing still I'm really addicted to. Cover me, Ava. Shoot the baddies. Luke, there's gonna be scrambled egg on the table in ten minutes. I want you downstairs, please. You all right, mate? Luke? - You all right, mate? - My head really hurts. Jesus. Luke. - Okay. Do you still feel sick? - Yeah. Hang on. I can't see. Let's have a look at you. - And is he sensitive to light? - Yes, the light bothers him. It hurts his eyes. Okay, I need you to ask Luke if he has any joint pain. Okay. Luke, mate, Do you have any pain anywhere? Do you hurt anywhere? Luke? Luke? Oh, Luke... Lukey. He won't wake up. - Okay, and how's Luke's breathing? - It's shallow. It's quite fast. Luke, mate, please. Come on, mate, please. Luke. Please wake up. Please wake up, babe. Please wake... Okay, we're gonna send an ambulance for Luke now, Mr. Worsley, and I'm gonna keep you on the line until it arrives, okay? - This is lovely. - Champagne brunch. It's taken over, hasn't it? Brunch. From elevenses. Who says "elevenses" these days? - I haven't got an answer to that, Darren? - Exactly. Anyway, a champagne brunch to make up for you not being at home this weekend. Thanks. And to celebrate the Erstklassige Werbung contract. So are you gonna have the bread, cheese, and sausage? Of course. The full German works. I'm starving. First things first, though... a toast. - To everything working out. - To everything working out. Cheers. Excuse, that's me. It's Paul. Hey. I can stay with you if you'd like. I can go if you prefer. Can you stay? But leave immediately when I ask you? Sure. No problem. - Is there anyone you'd like me to call? - No, I've called everyone. Thanks. Ally's on her way. Mum and Dad are on their way. Leah was out. I wanted to update you on Luke's condition. Yes, okay. Luke's temperature has spiked considerably, but we've put him on intravenous antibiotics, anti-virals, and IV fluids. And he's been taken to an isolation ward and is on constant observation by a dedicated nurse. - Can I see him? - Not at the moment. We need to do a lumbar puncture, take a CT scan, and possibly an MRI to rule out encephalitis. Right, yeah. Bloody hell. I understand how worrying this must be, but Luke's in very good hands. Yeah, thanks, Doctor. Carl. I think I'd like you to... - Of course. - Thank you. You're welcome. I hope that... well, you know. I think we can make the 13:20. There's enough time to get through security. - Okay. - And... - I have a car waiting at Gatwick. - Good. Paul, darling. Come here. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Will you have the meal? It's such a short flight. I don't think I will. - Any lunch for yourselves? - Nothing for Ally. She's... There's been... She's just not hungry. - Understood. And for yourself? - I'm fine, too, I think. Actually, maybe the mackerel is quite light. We're out of the mackerel, I'm afraid. We do have the chicken. And how is it... It's not important at all how it's done. There are bigger things to worry about, but how is it done? It's grilled with a portobello-mushroom sauce and Jersey Royal potatoes. - Yes, I'll have that, please. Thank you. - Certainly, sir. My colleague will be along with the drinks trolley. I'm having the chicken. - Minestrone. From the machine. - Thanks. I'm not really... No, you've got to keep your strength up for Luke, as well as for yourself. I should've spotted this. This is my fault. It's not. Yeah, it is. I wanted him out of the way. And now... He's in good hands. - Fuck, where's Ava? - Your dad took her. - You remember. - Yeah, yes. She's with Jim. She's safe. Has he ever babysat on his own before? He'll work it out. That's a very big cow, isn't it? - How much do you reckon it weighs? - I don't know. I'd say about 1,800 pounds. It's a whopper. You probably use kilograms, don't you? I've no idea what it is in those. - Can I have some juice? - Yes. I'll text Jackie in a minute, see how Luke is... and your dad. I've never told your dad I love him. Mad, isn't it, really? I've never kissed him. I've returned a hug, but I've never offered one. It's because of me age and, I suppose, me background. But all men were buttoned up like that, really, in the old days. Being a dad was the same for years, decades. And now suddenly you've got to be open, emotionally intelligent. Hug and kiss and carry on like you're Halle Berry or somebody. You want a biscuit? - Yeah, I can't stand it, Mum. - I know, love. I've been praying. Don't even believe in anything. Still been praying to something or someone. I know. I've been praying to Our Lady. - Whose lady? - Mary. Jesus's mother. - Yeah, of course, yeah. - But it's gonna be all right, Paul. They're gonna make him better. Could you please come with me, Mr. Worsley? - What's happened? - If you could please come with me.
