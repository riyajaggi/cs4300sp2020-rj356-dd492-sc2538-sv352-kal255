 Narrator: ALL'S QUIET IN APRIL SPENCER'S PENSACOLA, FLORIDA, HOME. THAT IS, UNTIL HER NEIGHBOR'S 11-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER RUNS THERE SCREAMING. SOMETHING HORRIBLE'S HAPPENED NEXT DOOR. APRIL INSTINCTIVELY DIALS 911. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] SHE WAS EXTREMELY FEARFUL. I WASN'T SCARED GOING NEXT DOOR, BUT I HAD TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. I DON'T THINK THOSE IMAGES WILL EVER LEAVE ME. [ SIRENS WAILING ] Narrator: PENSACOLA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT QUICKLY SENDS MULTIPLE UNITS TO THE SCENE. WHEN YOU'RE HEADED TO THE SCENE, YOU'RE REALLY ANXIOUS.

 YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO PREPARE YOURSELF. WHAT IS IT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN? YOU'RE TRYIN' TO FIGURE IT OUT BEFORE YOU EVEN GET THERE SOMETIMES WITHOUT EVEN KNOWIN' ANYTHING. Narrator: IN JUST MINUTES, POLICE ARE THERE. WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED AND WE SEE THAT MOST OF OUR PATROL UNITS FROM THAT DISTRICT ARE THERE, YOU KNOW THAT IT'S SERIOUS. RIGHT AWAY, YOU KNOW YOU'RE DEALIN' WITH SOMETHIN' THAT'S BIGGER THAN YOU NORMALLY DO. Narrator: SOMEBODY'S BROKEN IN USING BRUTE FORCE. WE SEE THE DOOR WAS KICKED IN. Narrator: WHOEVER DID THIS COULD STILL BE HERE LYING IN WAIT. ANXIOUS COPS SWEEP THE HOUSE WITH FINGERS ON TRIGGERS. THEN, AN ALARMING SIGHT. THERE WERE CHILDREN SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE HOME, AND THEY WERE FINDING THEM IN CLOSETS, AND UNDERNEATH BEDS, AND IN BEDS WITH COVERS OVER THEIR HEAD. Narrator: BUT WHAT THEY FIND NEXT ONLY CONFIRMS THEIR WORST FEARS. Guy: WE SEE SOME BLOOD, AND THEN WE NOTICED BOTH OF THE VICTIMS IN THE BEDROOM. Narrator: THE KID'S PARENTS, MELANIE AND BYRD "BUD" BILLINGS, LAY LIFELESS, SAVAGELY GUNNED DOWN IN THEIR OWN HOME. Morgan: THEY HAD BEEN SHOT AT POINT-BLANK RANGE. IT APPEARED TO BE AN EXECUTION. I MEAN, OBVIOUS IT WASN'T ANY TYPE OF MURDER-SUICIDE. ALMOST EXECUTION-STYLE MURDER. I MEAN, IT WAS PRETTY HORRENDOUS. Narrator: TWENTY MILES AWAY, THE BILLINGS' ELDEST DAUGHTER, ASHLEY, GETS A CALL FROM NEIGHBOR APRIL [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] TO GET HOME ASAP. Markham: APRIL WAS VERY HYSTERICAL. AT THAT POINT, I HAD NO IDEA, UM, WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I -- I'M ASSUMING AN ACCIDENT HAD HAPPENED THAT SOMEONE HAD FALLEN OR... THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS GOING THROUGH MY HEAD. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: ASHLEY'S PARENTS ARE GENEROUS PEOPLE WHO FOSTER A LARGE AND LOVING FAMILY. HI THERE. SEE THE MONKEYS? MY MOM AND DAD WERE SOUL MATES. THEY FOUND EACH OTHER LATER, YOU KNOW, IN LIFE. MY DAD HAD PREVIOUS CHILDREN. MY MOTHER HAD MYSELF AND MY SISTER. Narrator: ONCE THEY MARRY, BYRD AND MELANIE BEGIN ADOPTING CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. MY MOTHER FELT LIKE SHE COULD GIVE A WONDERFUL LIFE TO BABIES THAT HAD SPECIAL NEEDS. SHE JUST FELT THAT WAS HER CALLING. AND, OF COURSE, MY DAD WOULD DO WHATEVER SHE WANTED, AND HE HAD THAT LOVE FOR CHILDREN ALSO. THEY FILL THEIR CHEERFUL HOME WITH NINE BOYS AND GIRLS. Spencer: BUD AND MELANIE WERE THE MOST GRACIOUS, KINDHEARTED PEOPLE YOU WOULD EVER WANT TO KNOW -- FULL OF LIFE, FULL OF JOKES. EVERYTHING WAS ABOUT LAUGHTER, AND FUN, AND JUST LIVING LIFE. THEY WERE AWESOME. [ LAUGHS ] EVERY TIME YOU WALK IN, YOU HEAR LAUGHTER AND LIFE. Narrator: JUST 25 MINUTES LATER, WHEN SHE ARRIVES AT HER PARENTS' HOUSE-TURNED-CRIME-SCENE, ASHLEY KNOWS SOMETHING IS TERRIBLY WRONG. A POLICE OFFICER STOPPED ME. YOU KNOW, HE GRABBED ME, AND HE SAID, "YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE." HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE THAT THEIR PARENTS ARE DEAD? I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING. IT WAS JUST A COMPLETELY NUMB FEELING. FOR THEM TO BE TAKEN AWAY IN THAT MANNER WAS ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING, ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING. Narrator: THE CHILDREN TAKE REFUGE IN APRIL'S HOUSE NEXT DOOR. WITH THE SCENE SECURE, FORENSICS TEAMS MOVE IN DESPERATE TO FIND ANYTHING THAT COULD SET INVESTIGATORS ON A KILLER'S TRAIL. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY IN HOMICIDES. THE FIRST 72 HOURS ARE CRITICAL. Narrator: EVEN THE SMALLEST CLUE COULD BE VITAL. THE FIRST FEW HOURS IS ABOUT, UH, PRESERVATION OF THE SCENE, UH, AND THEN THE COLLECTION OF THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR HAIR, PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU CAN GET. Narrator: BUT FOR NOW, THEIR SEARCH UNCOVERS VERY LITTLE. Morgan: WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FIREARMS TO RECOVER. THEY DIDN'T LEAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE EXCEPT FOR SOME, UH, SHELL CASINGS. Narrator: A MURDER WEAPON'S FINGERPRINT. BUT UNTIL THEY FIND THE MATCHING GUN, THE SHELLS ARE USELESS. THE BREAK-IN SUGGESTS THE KILLER MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN THE VICTIM AT ALL. OUR GREATEST FEAR IS -- IS THE RANDOM KILLING. THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ALMOST ALWAYS GO UNSOLVED, UNFORTUNATELY. Narrator: IN THE MEANTIME, NEXT DOOR, INVESTIGATORS TALK TO THE CHILDREN ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW. CLEARLY TRAUMATIZED, THEY MAY HOLD THE KEY TO FINDING THEIR PARENT'S KILLER OR KILLERS. EVERYBODY OKAY? WE WENT TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE KIDS AND SEE WHO WE COULD TALK TO OR MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO. Narrator: ONE OF THE CHILDREN, 10-YEAR-OLD JAKE, WAS RIGHT BY HIS PARENT'S BEDROOM. THE TEAM NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT HE SAW, SO THEY TREAD LIGHTLY. HE WAS -- HE WAS VERY, VERY SHOOKEN UP. HE HAD SEEN, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING. Narrator: BUT JAKE HAS SEVERE DOWN SYNDROME AND IS SO DISTRESSED THAT HE STRUGGLES TO ANSWER EVEN THE GENTLEST QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HE SAW. Guy: IT WAS JUST DIFFICULT KNOWIN' THAT THEY HAD SEEN THIS HORRIFIC TYPE OF STUFF, AND IT WAS FRUSTRATING FOR US KNOWIN' THAT THEY COULDN'T HELP US SOLVE IT. Narrator: WHAT POLICE DO LEARN -- ONE OF THE BILLINGS' KIDS IS MISSING, 20-YEAR-OLD JUSTIN, WHO LIVES IN A TRAILER ON THE PROPERTY AND HAS BEEN IN A LONG-STANDING FEUD WITH HIS DAD. EVERYONE IS A SUSPECT, UH, THAT HAS ANY CONNECTION WITH A CRIME. FAMILY MEMBERS ARE SUSPECT. UH, KNOWN ASSOCIATES ARE SUSPECT. Narrator: POLICE WANT HIM TO TALK AND NOW. EVEN WHILE THE CRIME SCENE IS STILL BEING PROCESSED, THEY FIND HIM RIGHT WHERE HE LIVES -- ON THE BILLINGS' PROPERTY. BUT THEY QUESTION HIM AT THE POLICE STATION WHERE EVERYTHING GOES DOWN ON VIDEOTAPE. HE WAS REALLY, REALLY NERVOUS. ACTIN' REALLY STRANGE. [ LAUGHS ] AT THAT TIME, WE JUST GOT A VIBE THAT MAYBE THIS KID COULD -- COULD POSSIBLY BE INVOLVED. Narrator: THE DETECTIVES TRY PINNING DOWN WHERE JUSTIN WAS AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER. JUSTIN'S ALIBI NEEDS CHECKING, BUT RIGHT NOW SOMETHING EVEN MORE IMPORTANT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED AT THE CRIME SCENE. POLICE HAVE FOUND A NEW WITNESS, AND IT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS HORRIFIC MURDER. BYRD AND MELANIE'S HOME IS RIGGED WITH NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT 16 SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. FOR THE INVESTIGATORS, IT'S A GIFT. HAS THIS MURDER BEEN CAUGHT ON TAPE? Narrator: THE HUNT FOR WHO KILLED PARENTS BYRD AND MELANIE BILLINGS AS THEIR NINE CHILDREN HID KICKS INTO HIGH GEAR WHEN COPS DISCOVER 16 UNFLINCHING WITNESSES. Guy: WE SEE THE CAMERAS THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE, AND IT WAS UNUSUAL FOR A HOUSE TO HAVE THAT MUCH SURVEILLANCE INSIDE OF IT. MR. BILLINGS HAD PUT THE VIDEO THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HOUSE BECAUSE OF ALL THE KIDS THAT THEY HAD WITH THE DISABILITIES. Narrator: IF THE CAMERAS WERE ROLLING, THE KILLINGS MIGHT BE CAUGHT ON TAPE. IT WAS A VERY UNSETTLING FEELING KNOWING THAT IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED ON CAMERA. Guy: THE VIDEO WAS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF EVIDENCE WE HAD IN THIS CASE. SO, UH, RIGHT AWAY WE GOT OUR TECH GUYS TO COME OUT TO THE SCENE AND START RETRIEVING IT. Narrator: POLICE TECHNICIANS BEGIN RETRIEVING THE VIDEO FOOTAGE FROM ALL THE CAMERAS. IT WILL TAKE TIME. THE ONLY WITNESS TO THE CRIME, THE STATE-OF-THE-ART SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM, HOLDS HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF FOOTAGE. THE VITAL CLUE COULD BE ON ANY OF A MILLION VIDEO FRAMES. EVERY ONE MUST BE HANDLED WITH CARE. THE WELL-BEING OF NINE ORPHANED CHILDREN HANGS IN THE BALANCE AS THEIR OLDEST SISTER KNOWS ALL TOO WELL. Markham: I WAS IN SURVIVAL MODE. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT EACH OF THE CHILDREN NEEDED AT THAT TIME. UM, I FELT LIKE TELLING 'EM EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE OKAY. I COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I WASN'T SURE MYSELF AT THAT TIME. Narrator: 18 HOURS AFTER THE BODIES ARE FIRST FOUND, WHILE POLICE WAIT FOR THE CCTV FOOTAGE TO BE PROCESSED, THEY REVISIT THE HOUSE. DESPITE ASHLEY'S FRAGILE EMOTIONAL STATE, SHE'S DETERMINED TO LEND AN EYE. SHE JOINS DETECTIVES TO SEE IF SHE CAN SPOT ANYTHING THEY MIGHT HAVE MISSED. IT WAS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH THAT. YOU'RE ALWAYS VERY COGNIZANT OF -- OF DEALING WITH A FAMILY MEMBER AND WHAT THEIR EMOTIONAL REACTION'S GOING TO BE. AND NOW, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU, ACTUALLY, INTO THE MURDER SCENE. ASHLEY'S EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL CONDITION WAS -- WAS VERY CRITICAL. Narrator: BUT HER EFFORTS PAY OFF WHEN ASHLEY NOTICES TWO KEY ITEMS ARE MISSING -- HER DAD'S BLACK BRIEFCASE AND THE FAMILY SAFE. ASHLEY TOLD US THAT BUD CARRIED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CASH AROUND WITH HIM. HE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE AT LEAST $100,000 IN THAT BLACK BRIEFCASE AT ALL TIMES. Narrator: COULD THIS BE A BURGLARY GONE HORRIBLY WRONG? BYRD IS A WEALTHY AND WELL-KNOWN BUSINESSMAN RUNNING AN ALL-CASH BUSINESS FINANCING CARS. THAT EXPLAINS ALL THE CASH ON HAND, BUT IT'S A BUSINESS THAT ATTRACTS ITS SHARE OF SHADY CHARACTERS. Morgan: THEY GOT, SPECIFICALLY, TWO ITEMS THAT SHOULD HAVE HAD A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF CASH IN THE HOME. THAT IS ALWAYS INDICATIVE OF INSIDE INFORMATION. SOMEONE HAD AN ASSOCIATION WITH BYRD BILLINGS TO KNOW THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IF YOU'RE GOING TO ROB THIS FAMILY. ASHLEY ASSISTED US IN ALL OF THE THINGS THAT MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH A NORMAL MURDER. BUSINESS ASSOCIATES -- DID SOMEONE OWE BYRD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY? HAD THEY STOLEN FROM HIM? HAD THERE BEEN, YOU KNOW, RECENT BLOWUPS OR RUN-INS? Narrator: SOMEONE WHO FITS THAT PROFILE IS A LOCAL USED CAR DEALER NAMED TOM JOHNSON. HE KNOWS BYRD, AND ABOUT THE HOARD OF CASH IN THE HOUSE. THEY WERE VERY CLOSE BUSINESS PARTNERS, UH, FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THE INDIVIDUAL GOT GREEDY AND STARTED DOING THINGS BEHIND MY DAD'S BACK. AND I THINK THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL JUST GOT IN OVER HIS HEAD MORE AND MORE. Narrator: TOM JOHNSON OWES BYRD A LOT OF MONEY FROM SELLING CARS AND POCKETING THE PROCEEDS. BUD WAS NOT GETTING HIS PAYMENT FOR THE FINANCING OF THE CARS. HE OWED BUD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. TO HELL WITH IT. Markham: AND WHEN MY DAD FINALLY DECIDED TO PULL OUT, IT JUST CREATED A -- A BIG PROBLEM FOR EVERYBODY. THERE WAS DEFINITELY BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THEM. Guy: ASHLEY REALLY ADAMANT THAT THIS GUY WAS SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN THEIR PARENTS' MURDER. Narrator: HEAVILY IN BYRD'S DEBT, TOM JOHNSON BECOMES THE PRIME SUSPECT WITH A PERFECT MOTIVE FOR WANTING HIM DEAD. INVESTIGATORS WASTE NO TIME GETTING IN FRONT OF HIM. Guy: WE HAD WENT TO THE CAR LOT TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL. HOW CAN I HELP YOU? WHILE WE WERE INTERVIEWIN' HIM, WE GOT A BAD VIBE FROM HIM. HE WAS JUST REAL NERVOUS, REAL SHAKY, WASN'T VERY DIRECT WITH SOME OF HIS ANSWERS. THERE'S CERTAIN DEMEANOR THAT WE LOOK FOR. ALL THE CLUES WERE THERE OF HIM BEIN' DECEPTIVE. BUT SUSPICION IS ALL COPS HAVE ON HIM, NOTHING SOLID FOR NOW. MEANWHILE, AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS, ANOTHER PART OF THE INVESTIGATION HAS A BREAKTHROUGH. THE SECURITY VIDEO FROM THE CRIME SCENE IS READY FOR VIEWING. EVERYTHING RESTS ON IT. POLICE DESPERATELY HOPE IT WILL TELL THEM SOMETHING, OR BYRD AND MELANIE'S MURDERS MAY NEVER BE SOLVED. AND NOW, THE TEAM WATCHES FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. WE REALLY THINK THAT THIS VIDEO IS GONNA HELP US SOLVE THIS CASE. Narrator: AND WHAT THEY SEE SHOCKS EVEN THE MOST SEASONED DETECTIVE IN THE ROOM. IT WAS PRETTY SILENT WHEN WE FIRST SAW IT. WE'VE DEALT WITH MURDERS. UM, I MEAN, THAT WAS OUR JOB, AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID. BUT WE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. Narrator: IN PENSACOLA, FLORIDA, POLICE HUNT THE KILLERS OF BYRD AND MELANIE BILLINGS, KINDHEARTED PARENTS OF NINE ADOPTED CHILDREN. THEY GET VERY LUCKY, RECOVERING FOOTAGE FROM 16 SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AROUND THE HOUSE. NOW, THE TEAM WATCHES IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, UNPREPARED FOR THE SHOCK OF WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO WITNESS. CAN YOU STOP THAT? Man: CAN YOU ZOOM IN ON THAT? Molchan: THEY WERE DRESSED IN MILITARY GARB. THEY USED MILITARY-TYPE WEAPONS. THEY LOOKED VERY, VERY DANGEROUS. Narrator: THEY COUNT THREE MASKED INTRUDERS BREAKING INTO THE FRONT AND TWO MORE ENTERING THROUGH THE REAR. THIS WAS A SIMULTANEOUS ENTRANCE FROM THE FRONT AND THE BACK AT THE SAME TIME MEANT TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS SHOCK EFFECT ON THE FAMILY. UH, AND OF COURSE, OBVIOUSLY IT WORKS. Narrator: BYRD AND MELANIE ARE CONFRONTED IN NO TIME. Molchan: ONE INDIVIDUAL GETS AHOLD OF MR. BILLINGS AND THEN SHOOTS MR. BILLINGS IN THE LEG. AS SOON AS MR. BILLINGS GET SHOT IN THE LEG, LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE A CONVERSATION. THEN, THEY GO TOWARDS THE BEDROOM. THAT'S WHEN WE LOSE VIDEO BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CAMERA INSIDE THEIR MASTER BEDROOM. Narrator: AND THAT'S WHERE THE COUPLE ARE SHOT AT POINT-BLANK RANGE. THEY'RE ONLY IN THE HOUSE ABOUT FOUR MINUTES, AND TWO PEOPLE ARE DEAD. I THINK IT'S BEST DESCRIBED AS A MAN'S WORST FEAR. YOUR HOME'S INVADED. YOU CAN'T PROTECT YOUR FAMILY -- YOUR WIFE, YOUR CHILDREN -- AND YOU'RE HELPLESS. AND I THINK, DEEP TO OUR CORE AS MEN, THAT'S -- THAT'S WHO WE ARE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ABOUT. Narrator: THE MURDER MAY BE OFF CAMERA, BUT THE VIDEO IS MORE THAN ENOUGH TO JUMP-START THE INVESTIGATION. WE FELT LIKE WHOEVER DID THIS KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOIN' AND PLANNED ON DOIN'. Morgan: ORGANIZED CRIME, UH, WAS ALWAYS A CONSIDERATION BECAUSE OF THE STYLE OF MURDER. THEY'RE SICK PEOPLE. THEY'RE MEAN, EVIL EVEN. Narrator: FOR NOW, THERE'S NO WAY TO I.D. THE MASKED KILLERS. BUT POLICE SEIZE UPON THE MOST OBVIOUS CLUES -- TWO VEHICLES. THE LARGEST PIECE OF EVIDENCE WE HAD WAS THE VIDEO FOOTAGE OF THE VEHICLE THAT WAS USED. SO FINDING THE VAN WAS CRITICAL. WE ALSO CAUGHT A VIDEO IMAGE OF A GOLD EXPLORER WHICH WAS THE VEHICLE THAT HAD DROPPED THESE TWO ADDITIONAL MALES OFF. Narrator: A RED VAN, A GOLD EXPLORER -- IF THEY CAN FIND THE VEHICLE'S OWNERS, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THE LEAD COULD TAKE THEM FURTHER. BUT WITHOUT A CLEAR SHOT OF THE LICENSE PLATES, THE SHERIFF REACHES OUT FOR HELP RELEASING IMAGES TO THE PUBLIC. Man: POLICE HAVE NOW RELEASED PICTURES OF THAT VAN AND ARE ASKING THE PUBLIC FOR HELP IN LOCATING IT. Narrator: THERE ARE LOTS OF GOLD EXPLORERS IN THE AREA, BUT SOMEONE OUT THERE MUST RECOGNIZE THE DISTINCTIVE RED VAN WITH ITS CUSTOM GRILL. THE REACH OF THE MEDIA IS INTO EVERY HOME. Man: A RED VAN SPOTTED ON SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. WE MADE SURE THAT IT WAS ON EVERY TELEVISION SCREEN, UH, IN THE LOCAL AREA. AND SO WE HAD THOUSANDS OF EYES LOOKING FOR A RED VAN. PUTTING THAT OUT TO THE MEDIA IS THE QUICKEST, FASTEST WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO GENERATE SOME TYPE OF CONNECTION BETWEEN THE VAN AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE DRIVING IT. Narrator: PATIENTLY WAITING FOR THAT ONE PHONE CALL, THAT CRITICAL LINK IS THE MOST EXCRUCIATING TIME FOR ANY COP. Morgan: WE'VE GOT THE RED VAN OUT THERE. YOU'RE WANTING THE PHONE TO RING. YOU'RE WANTING THAT NEXT LEAD TO COME IN. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TO HAVE TO WATCH THE CLOCK TICK, UH, WITH NO ADDITIONAL LEAD. Molchan: THEY'RE A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GONNA STRIKE NEXT. Guy: THE FAMILY WAS VERY FRIGHTENED, AND RIGHTFULLY SO. THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY MIGHT BE THE NEXT TARGETS. SO YEAH. THEY WERE SCARED. THEY WERE SCARED TO DEATH. Markham: WE FEARED FOR OUR LIVES AND FOR THE SAFETY AND THE LIVES OF THE KIDS. Narrator: AS LONG AS THOSE KILLERS ARE ON THE LOOSE AND THAT RED VAN ON THE ROLL, THE WHOLE FAMILY'S IN DANGER. THIRTY-SIX HOURS SINCE THE MURDERS. HEY, SHERIFF. WE GOT A CALL FROM A GENTLEMAN WHO SAID, "I HAVE YOUR VAN. "I'M ON THE PHONE, AND -- AND, BY THE WAY, I'M LOOKING AT IT. IT'S RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET." [ SIRENS WAILING ] Narrator: NOW, IT'S A RACE TO CONFIRM WHAT COULD BE THE BIGGEST BREAK THEY'LL GET. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY. [ WAILING CONTINUES ] YOU DON'T WANT THE VAN TO BE DESTROYED. WE DON'T WANT THE VAN TO BE TRANSPORTED OUT OF THE LOCAL AREA. [ SIRENS WAILING ] Narrator: PENSACOLA SHERIFF'S INVESTIGATORS CATCH A HUGE BREAK IN THEIR SEARCH FOR THE OMINOUS RED VAN THAT CARRIED A TEAM OF ASSASSINS TO BYRD AND MELANIE BILLINGS' HOUSE. WHEN POLICE REACH THE TRAILER PARK WHERE IT HAS BEEN SIGHTED, THE VAN IS STILL THERE. WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT UPON FINDING THE VAN, WHO MIGHT BE IN THE HOME. IT'S PARKED NEXT TO THE HOME OF AN ELDERLY MAN NAMED PATRICK GONZALEZ. WE BEGAN TO TALK WITH, UM, GONZALEZ. HE WAS NOT IN VERY GOOD SHAPE AT ALL. KIND OF DOWN ON HIS LUCK. Narrator: SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT. THE MORE THEY LOOK AT GONZALEZ, THE LESS HE MATCHES ANY OF THE SUSPECTS CAUGHT ON CAMERA. Guy: BECAUSE OF HIS HEALTH, HIS AGE, IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE ONES THAT WENT IN THE HOUSE AND COMMITTED THIS CRIME. IS THAT YOUR VAN? Narrator: PATRICK GONZALEZ CLAIMS THE VAN BELONGS TO HIS SON, AND IT'S UNDER REPAIR AND HASN'T BEEN DRIVEN IN WEEKS. HIS STORY WAS THAT THE VAN DIDN'T EVEN RUN. GONZALEZ IS LOOKING LIKE A DEAD END, WHEN ANOTHER TIPSTER CALLS IN ABOUT ANOTHER RED VAN. UNITS RUSH TO A LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE WHERE IT WAS SIGHTED. ONCE MORE, SECURITY CAMERAS ARE ON SITE. AND THEY SAID, "WE HAVE A VIDEO OF THIS RED VAN, WE BELIEVE, THAT SHOWS THE OCCUPANTS." AND IT WAS FROM ONLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE. Narrator: THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO GIVES POLICE A CLEAR SHOT OF THE DRIVER, SOMEONE WHO LOOKS FAMILIAR. IT'S THE OLD MAN -- PATRICK GONZALEZ. HE'S GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO DO. AND HE'LL DO IT ON CAMERA. Morgan: WE PRESENTED HIM WITH THE VIDEO EVIDENCE. HERE'S THIS VAN WITH YOUR IMAGE AT THIS PARTICULAR CONVENIENCE STORE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO NOW TELL US THE TRUTH? AND THAT'S WHEN FEAR BECAME EVIDENT IN HIM. Narrator: TO THE TEAM'S SURPRISE, THEIR PROMISE OF LIMITED IMMUNITY GETS GONZALEZ TO OPEN UP. AND WHAT HE TELLS INVESTIGATORS DOESN'T DISAPPOINT. GONZALEZ INSISTS HE WAS JUST THE GETAWAY DRIVER AND THAT HE NEVER WENT INSIDE THE HOUSE. AND THEN, HE FINGERS TWO ACCOMPLICES. Morgan: THE NAMES THAT HE GAVE, AGAIN, WERE HIS SON, PATRICK GONZALEZ JR., AND WAYNE COLDIRON. Narrator: COLDIRON AND GONZALEZ JR. THERE'S MORE. GONZALEZ SR. TELLS POLICE HIS SON, PATRICK JR. HAS ACTUALLY BEEN INSIDE THE BILLINGS HOUSE ON A CONSTRUCTION JOB, SO HE KNOWS THE LAYOUT AND POSSIBLY ABOUT WHERE THE CASH IS KEPT. BUT PATRICK GONZALEZ SR.'s ALREADY LIED TO POLICE ABOUT THE VAN BEING UNDER REPAIR. WHY WOULD HE TELL THE TRUTH NOW? BY ACCUSING HIS SON, HE MIGHT JUST BE CONCOCTING THE PERFECT OUT. Molchan: THE WORST THING YOU COULD HAVE IS TO HAVE YOUR WHOLE CASE BUILT AROUND ONE PERSON, GONZALEZ SR., WHO HAD A TROUBLED PAST TO SAY THE LEAST. WE HAD A FATHER IMPLICATING HIS SON. WE KNOW THAT THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE WEAKEST KINDS OF EVIDENCE. YOU GRAB COLDIRON AND GONZALEZ JR., AND YOU BRING 'EM IN TO TRY TO GET THEM TO CONFESS. Narrator: BUT INSTEAD OF A CONFESSION, THEY GET A YARN THAT TURNS HIS DAD'S STORY ON ITS HEAD. Morgan: HE TOOK A POSITION OF -- OF COMPLETE AND TOTAL DENIABILITY. ACCUSED US OF HAVING BROWBEATEN AN OLD ALCOHOLIC MAN INTO SAYING THINGS THAT WERE NOT TRUE. GONZALEZ JR. WAS ARROGANT, A VERY SUPERIOR ATTITUDE. AN ATTITUDE OF, "I'M THE SMARTEST MAN IN THE ROOM." Narrator: RIGHT ON CAMERA, PATRICK GONZALEZ JR. SHRUGS OFF EVERY ALLEGATION AGAINST HIM. COLDIRON DENIES IT ALL TOO. BOTH COLDIRON AND GONZALEZ JR. ARE DENYING ANY INVOLVEMENT. AND ALL WE HAVE NOW IS ONE WITNESS THAT SAYS, "NO. THESE FOLKS WERE INVOLVED." WE DIDN'T HAVE SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE TO SECURE AN ARREST WARRANT AT THAT POINT. SO THEREFORE, WE HAD TO ALLOW THEM TO LEAVE. THE BREAK THAT WE NEED IS FOR SOMEONE TO START TELLING US THE TRUTH. Narrator: FORTY HOURS SINCE THE BRUTAL CRIME WENT DOWN, THREE SUSPECTS, TWO DENIALS. ONLY HARD EVIDENCE CAN DECIDE WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH. PRESSURE FROM THE BEREAVED FAMILY GROWS WITH EVERY PASSING HOUR. I WANTED ANSWERS. I WANTED TO KNOW WHY. I WANTED TO KNOW HOW. Narrator: SO DO POLICE. THEY EXECUTE A SEARCH WARRANT AT GONZALEZ SR.'s TRAILER. Guy: THE HOUSE IS NOT IN THE BEST SHAPE -- DIRTY, MANGY. Narrator: STILL, THERE'S ONE THING THAT LOOKS NEAT AND TUCKED IN. Guy: SO THE SERGEANT SEES THIS SHOEBOX THAT APPEARS TO BE NEW AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. FOR WHATEVER REASON, HE FELT THAT IT WAS OUT OF PLACE. Narrator: THE SHOEBOX IS EMPTY, BUT OFFICERS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT IT ONCE CONTAINED. Guy: THIS SHOEBOX HELD SOME BLACK, UM, MILITARY BOOTS. Narrator: POLICE TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT THE CRIME-SCENE VIDEO. THIS TIME, THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC -- FOOTWEAR -- AND FIND IT. THE MASKED GUNMEN WERE WEARING BLACK BOOTS. IS IT JUST A COINCIDENCE? I'M LIKE, "I THINK THE SHOEBOX PROBABLY CAME FROM WALMART." I BET WE CAN TAKE THAT TO WALMART 'CAUSE THEIR SECURITY IS SO EXCELLENT, SCAN THAT CODE, AND I BET YOU THEY CAN TELL US EXACTLY WHEN IT WAS BOUGHT. Narrator: IT'S JUST A HUNCH, BUT WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION. THEY WERE ABLE TO TELL US EXACTLY WHAT TIME THE BOX WAS BOUGHT. AND THEY HAVE SECURITY VIDEO OF THE MOMENT THE BOOTS WERE PURCHASED. THEY STARTED HELPIN' US RETRIEVE VIDEO. WHEN WE START VIEWIN' IT, WE SEE PATRICK GONZALEZ PURCHASE THE BOOTS. THAT'S HIM. Narrator: WHO WAS HE WITH? THE STORE HAS THE PARKING LOT COVERED WITH VIDEO AS WELL. Guy: IN THE PARKING LOT, WE SEE A FORD EXPLORER, AND WE'RE LIKE, "WAIT JUST A SECOND." Narrator: A GOLD EXPLORER. IS IT THE ONE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR? IT GETS EVEN BETTER. REWINDING THE STORE FOOTAGE, INVESTIGATORS SPOT GONZALEZ JR. TALKING TO TWO MEN WHO ARRIVED AT THE STORE IN A GOLD EXPLORER. IT'S JUST LIKE THE ONE SEEN AT THE BILLINGS' COMPOUND. THE TIME -- JUST FOUR HOURS BEFORE THE BILLINGS WERE SHOT. Molchan: AND THEY BASICALLY LEAVE TOGETHER WITH THE GOLD EXPLORER AND PATRICK GONZALEZ IN HIS CAR. Guy: WE START GETTIN' EXCITED. WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE ON TO SOMETHIN', AND WE MAY BE STARTIN' TO PUT THIS THING TOGETHER. Narrator: IT'S THE FIRST PIECE OF HARD EVIDENCE LINKING GONZALEZ JR. TO THE MURDERS. HE'S NOW TIED TO BOTH VEHICLES AT THE MURDER SCENE. BUT WITH FIVE INTRUDERS AND TWO DRIVERS IN THE SECURITY FOOTAGE AND ONLY THREE SUSPECTS, POLICE STILL HAVE ARMED AND DANGEROUS TO-DOS TO CHECK OFF THEIR LIST. Morgan: THE NOOSE WAS TIGHTENING ON THESE FOLKS. WE'VE GOT NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE HOUSE, VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF -- OF THE GOLD FORD EXPLORER NOW, BUT WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A COMPLETE PICTURE. AND THEN, LITERALLY A BOLT FROM THE BLUE, TWO YOUNG BLACK MALES TURN THEMSELVES IN. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY HAD DONE A -- AND WHAT THEY PLAYED IN THE CASE. Narrator: WHILE NINE GRIEVING CHILDREN LAY THEIR PARENTS TO REST... INVESTIGATORS GET A BREAK THAT MIGHT JUST WRAP THEIR KILLERS' ROUNDUP. TWO YOUNG MEN CLAIM TO HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT BYRD AND MELANIE BILLINGS' MURDER. Molchan: RAKEEM FLORENCE IS A JUVENILE. FREDERICK THORNTON, HE WAS 19 AT THE TIME. FREDERICK THORNTON WAS A FRIEND WITH RAKEEM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THEY ARE OUT OF WORK. THEY'RE NOT IN SCHOOL. THEY HAVE COME IN TO THE -- THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH THEIR FAMILY. Narrator: AGAIN, THE INTERVIEWS ARE ON POLICE CAMERAS FOR EVIDENCE, AND IT'S MUST-SEE TV. AND THE TRUTH SEEMS TO COME FIRSTHAND BECAUSE THEY WERE THERE FOR THE BILLINGS' MURDERS. THE TARGET -- BYRD BILLINGS' BRIEFCASE AND SAFE FULL OF CASH. THEY WERE THE TWO INDIVIDUALS THAT ENTERED THROUGH THE LAUNDRY ROOM AND KITCHEN AREA... AND THEY HAD BEEN INTEGRALLY INVOLVED IN THE ROBBERY AND THE MURDER. Morgan: SO THEY TOLD A COMPLETE STORY FROM BEGINNING TO END. WE NOW KNEW THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS INSIDE THE HOME, AND EVEN THAT WHICH WAS NOT COVERED BY VIDEO SURVEILLANCE. AND THEY EACH CORROBORATED EACH OTHER'S STORY. Narrator: FREDERICK AND RAKEEM ARE WORKING FOR PATRICK GONZALEZ, JR.'s FRIEND AT AN AUTO SHOP WHEN HE RECRUITS THEM. FLORENCE AND THORNTON BOTH DESCRIBE PATRICK GONZALEZ JR. AS BEIN' THE MASTERMIND, THE BOSS, THE LEADER. Narrator: GONZALEZ JR. KNOWS ABOUT A HOUSE WITH LOTS OF CASH, AND HE KNOWS WHERE IT'S KEPT. HE PROMISES EACH A SHARE OF THE SPOILS. PATRICK GONZALEZ JR. TALKS ABOUT ROBBING A PERSON IN PENSACOLA. HE SAYS THAT THIS MAN HAS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THAT THEY CAN ROB THIS GUY AND MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. SO NOW, THIS MOSAIC STARTS TO TAKE A FORM, AND A PICTURE BEGINS TO -- TO FORM. Narrator: THE INVESTIGATORS HEAR THAT GONZALEZ JR. METICULOUSLY PLANS EVERY ASPECT OF THE BREAK-IN WITH MILITARY PRECISION. THEY TRAINED TOGETHER FOR 30 DAYS. PATRICK WAS A FORMER NATIONAL GUARDSMAN, HAD A LITTLE BIT OF INFANTRY KNOWLEDGE. THEY ALSO PRACTICED AT, UH, GONZALEZ SR.'s HOUSE ON HOW TO ENTER A BACK DOOR AND FRONT DOOR AT THE SAME TIME. LET'S GO. IN. SIDE DOOR. FRONT DOOR. AND THE ENTERING INTO THE BILLINGS' HOME WAS JUST THAT, WITHIN SECONDS. TRY IT AGAIN. Narrator: ON JULY 9th, THE GANG LOCKS AND LOADS, READY FOR ACTION. THE MILITARY ARSENAL IS BONE-CHILLING. GUNS THAT MATCH THE SHELL CASINGS FOUND AT THE SCENE. SO THEY'RE ALL ARMED AND READY TO GO. RAKEEM FLORENCE KICKS THAT DOOR IN. THEY COME IN THROUGH THE SIDE DOOR. THEY IMMEDIATELY SEE MR. AND MRS. BILLINGS. Gonzalez Jr.: YOU, STAY WHERE YOU ARE! Narrator: GONZALEZ JR. MAKES A BEELINE FOR BYRD BILLINGS... WHERE IS THE MONEY? [ GUNSHOT ] THEN SHOOTS HIM IN THE LEG. Byrd: [ SCREAMING ] TIE THEM UP! UP WE GO. OH, GOD! TURN AROUND. LOOK AT ME. WHERE'S THE SAFE, HUH? AS THE CHILDREN SCATTER AND HIDE... [ PISTOL COCKS ] Gonzalez Jr.: OPEN THE SAFE! [ GUNSHOTS ] ...GONZALEZ EXECUTES THEIR PARENTS. GET THE SAFE, NOW! THE INVADERS TAKE BYRD'S BRIEFCASE AND SAFE, AND MAKE THEIR ESCAPE. AS THEY DRIVE AWAY, GONZALEZ THREATENS THE REST OF THE CREW. Morgan: THEIR INVOLVEMENT AND CONFESSIONS WAS THE LAST DOMINO THAT WE NEEDED TO TIP OVER TO BRING THE REST OF THE DOMINOS DOWN. Narrator: POLICE TAKE DOWN GONZALEZ JR. AND HIS COHORTS, EIGHT IN ALL, TO THE IMMENSE RELIEF OF THE BILLINGS FAMILY. I ASKED YOU IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT I COULD DO FOR YOU, AND YOUR RESPONSE BACK TO ME WAS, "SHERIFF, FIND THE PEOPLE WHO DID THIS." IT IS MY HONOR TODAY TO TELL YOU, ASHLEY, AND YOUR FAMILY, WE HAVE FOUND THEM, AND THEY ARE IN CUSTODY. ONCE THE SHERIFF TOLD US THAT ALL EIGHT PEOPLE HAD BEEN ARRESTED, THAT WAS DEFINITELY A SENSE OF RELIEF. Narrator: IT'S A CASE THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SOLVED WITHOUT ALERT POLICE ARMED WITH VIDEO SURVEILLANCE IN STORES, POLICE STATIONS, AND IN THE BILLINGS' HOME. IT WAS PROOF WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED. THE VIDEOTAPES WERE SO CRITICAL IN SOLVING THIS CASE. IT TIED ALL OF THESE -- THIS DISPARATE GROUP OF CHARACTERS TOGETHER. Narrator: ON OCTOBER 28th, 2010, AFTER A FOUR-DAY TRIAL, PATRICK GONZALEZ JR. IS FOUND GUILTY ON TWO COUNTS OF MURDER AND ARMED HOME INVASION ROBBERY. Woman: A MAJORITY OF THE JURY, BY A VOTE OF 10 TO 2, ADVISE AND RECOMMEND TO THE COURT THAT IT IMPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY UPON LEONARD PATRICK GONZALEZ, JR. Narrator: TODAY, HE SITS ON FLORIDA'S DEATH ROW. THE OTHER SEVEN ARE CONVICTED AS ACCESSORIES AND SENTENCED TO A COMBINED 200 YEARS BEHIND BARS. I DO HAVE A SENSE OF CLOSURE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR SHOOTING MY PARENTS, FOR ACTUALLY SHOOTING THEM, IS WHERE HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE. Narrator: IN THIS CRIME, AS IN SO MANY OTHERS, THE CAMERA IS THE UNBLINKING WITNESS THAT SEES IT ALL AND NEVER LIES. KEEP WATCHING.
