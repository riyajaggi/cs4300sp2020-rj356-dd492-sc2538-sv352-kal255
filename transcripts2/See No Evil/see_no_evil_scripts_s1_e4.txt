 SHE WAS NEVER ON THE VIDEO. ...THAT LEADS POLICE TO THE KILLER. I'M IN SHOCK, WONDERING WHAT MY NEXT STEP WOULD BE. TWO CASES. ONE WITNESS THAT NEVER BLINKS AND NEVER LIES. BUSINESSMAN DOUG COKER HAS BEEN HAPPILY MARRIED TO HIS WIFE, JUDY, FOR 30 YEARS. TOGETHER, THEY LIVE IN HENRY COUNTRY, GEORGIA, 30 MILES FROM ATLANTA. WHEN WE FOUND EACH OTHER, IT WAS LIKE WE HAD FOUND OUR -- OUR SOUL MATES. HE WAS A GENEROUS, LOVING, CARING PERSON. HE JUST ENJOYED LIFE AND ENJOYED LAUGHING. THE MORNING OF MARCH 13th, 2012,

 IS LIKE ANY OTHER DAY FOR DOUG AND JUDY. WE BOTH GOT UP, GOT READY FOR WORK. HE HAD AN ERRAND TO RUN FOR ME. BEFORE GETTING ON WITH A BUSY DAY... I KISSED HIM BYE. IT WAS LIKE ANY OTHER DAY. LITTLE DOES JUDY KNOW, THAT COULDN'T BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. DOUG AND JUDY ARE TURNING THEIR CONSIDERABLE REAL ESTATE WEALTH INTO A CHARITABLE FOUNDATION, AND DOUG HAS A MEETING THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS DETAILS. LATE MORNING, JUDY CALLS HER HUSBAND ON HIS CELL TO MAKE SURE HE WENT TO THE POST OFFICE. BUT SHE GETS NO ANSWER. WHEN I HAD NOT HEARD FROM HIM BY 1:00, I BEGAN TO WORRY. THIS WASN'T LIKE HIM. JUDY CALLS ONE OF DOUG'S CLOSE BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. THEN I SAID, "HAVE YOU TALKED WITH DOUG?" AND HE SAID, "NO." AND I SAID, "WELL, I CAN'T GET HIM TO ANSWER THE PHONE." SHE CALLS OTHER FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THEY HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM, EITHER. SHE KNOWS HE HAD A MEETING TODAY ABOUT THE CHARITY, BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS HELD. ALL KIND OF THOUGHTS GOING THROUGH MY MIND. I THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU KNOW, HE WAS -- HE WAS SICK. AFTER SEVERAL MORE HOURS WITHOUT WORD, JUDY IS AT THE END OF HER ROPE. WE CALLED THE STATE PATROL AND HOSPITALS, ASK IF THERE HAD BEEN AN ACCIDENT REPORTED. BUT THERE'S STILL NO TRACE OF DOUG COKER. I WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE WORRIED. THIS WAS A VERY CLOSE FAMILY. THIS WAS A TYPE OF FAMILY THAT KEPT IN CLOSE COMMUNICATIONS AT ALL TIMES. SHE CALLS DOUG'S NEPHEW, JIM, AND ASKS HIM TO CALL THE POLICE. DETECTIVE BROC JOHNSON IS WITH THE HENRY COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT. OFFICERS RESPONDED TO HER HOUSE. THEY GATHER THE INFORMATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT WILL BE A CRITICAL MISSING PERSON. THIS MEANS ANYONE WHO HAS DISAPPEARED IN UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR HAS A HEALTH PROBLEM. HE HAD -- HAD SOME MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT WERE OF CONCERN. I BELIEVE AN ANEURYSM. AN ANEURYSM CAN CAUSE DEATH IF NOT TREATED QUICKLY. JUDY IS WORRIED THAT DOUG HAS FALLEN ILL. IS HE LYING SICK SOMEWHERE AND UNABLE TO REACH HIS PHONE? WE PUT OUT A BOLO IN OUR COUNTY FOR HIM. IT GOES OUT OVER OUR RADIOS. B- O-L-O -- BE ON LOOKOUT. DOUG OWNS AND OPERATES 40 RENTAL PROPERTIES IN THE AREA. HE WOULD FIX THEM UP AND THEN SELL THEM OR RENT THEM. COULD HE BE TRAPPED OR SICK INSIDE ONE OF HIS OWN BUILDINGS? OFFICERS RESPOND TO EACH RENTAL ADDRESS. THEY COULD NOT FIND ANY SIGN OF HIM. DOUG HAS VANISHED. EVEN MORE WORRYING, DOUG'S PHONE IS NO LONGER WORKING. I JUST FELT SO AFRAID TO THINK ABOUT WHAT POSSIBLY WAS GOING TO BE THE ANSWER. HOURS AFTER DOUG LEFT HOME, JUDY'S FRIENDS, ALSO WORRIED ABOUT DOUG'S ILL HEALTH, HELP WITH THE SEARCH. WE HAD TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY. THERE WERE GROUPS THAT VOLUNTEERED AND THEY WERE ORGANIZED. THEY SEARCHED THE AREA. EVERY MINUTE COUNTS. THEY HUNT THROUGH LOCAL WOODLAND, ROADS, AND BACKCOUNTRY LOOKING FOR DOUG. THEY STARTED RUNNING THE RIVER WHICH IS CLOSE BY HERE. WE HAVE FRIENDS WITH PLANES. THEY WERE TRYING TO SEE FROM ABOVE IF THEY COULD SEE HIS CAR; MAYBE IT HAD RUN OFF THE ROAD. THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND ANY SIGN OF IT. TWELVE HOURS SINCE JUDY LAST SAW DOUG, AND THERE IS STILL NO TRACE OF HIM. FROM THERE, THE POLICE STARTED TRYING TO COME UP WITH OTHER SOLUTIONS. POLICE TRY ANOTHER KIND OF SEARCH. THEY PING CELL TOWERS IN THE AREA TO SEE WHICH ONES PICKED UP DOUG'S PHONE ON THE DAY HE DISAPPEARED... AND MAKE A DISCOVERY. DOUG'S CELLPHONE WAS IN MACON, GEORGIA, 57 MILES FROM HOME. THE CELL TOWERS SHOW IT WAS NEAR A McDONALD'S IN THE CENTER OF MACON. WAS DOUG THERE? DETECTIVE JAMEY JONES FROM THE BIBB COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE FOLLOWS UP. IT WAS ABOUT 9:30, 10:00 AT NIGHT. THE McDONALD'S WAS CLOSED. THERE, THE EMPLOYEES WERE CLEANING UP. AND THERE ISN'T ANYONE LEFT TO QUESTION. BUT THEN, HE SEES A WITNESS -- THREE OF THEM. SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS, AND THEY COVER THE WHOLE RESTAURANT. IF DOUG WAS HERE, IT SHOULD BE ON VIDEO. CAN THESE CAMERAS SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF DOUG'S DISAPPEARANCE? COMING UP, WHEN A YOUNG MOTHER IS MURDERED, POLICE ARE IN A DESPERATE RACE TO FIND THE KILLER, AND ONLY SECURITY CAMERAS CAN HELP THEM BEFORE HE STRIKES AGAIN. POLICE ARE ON THE HUNT FOR MISSING BUSINESSMAN DOUG COKER. IT'S BEEN A DAY AND A HALF, AND DOUG'S WIFE, JUDY, IS TERRIFIED. YOUR MIND JUST NEVER STOPS, AND YOU'RE THINKING CONTINUALLY, AND YOU DON'T KNOW REALLY NIGHT FROM DAY. IT'S JUST ONE LONG NIGHTMARE. CELL TOWER RECORDS SHOW HIS PHONE WAS NEAR A McDONALD'S IN MACON, GEORGIA. IT'S THE LAST TRACE OF HIM SINCE. DETECTIVE JAMEY JONES PULLS THE RESTAURANT'S SECURITY VIDEO. FINDING THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE THERE AT McDONALD'S WAS A KEY CLUE TO STARTING THE INVESTIGATION FOR US. HE STARTS THE VIDEO AT 9:30 A.M., EYES TRAINED ON THE DOOR INTO THE RESTAURANT. HE WATCHES FOR ANYONE WHO LOOKS LIKE DOUG. AT 11:02, 92 MINUTES INTO THE VIDEO, HE SPOTS HIM. MR. COKER COMES INTO THE McDONALD'S RESTAURANT. YOU SEE HIM WALKING IN. HE COMES TO THE COUNTER AND ORDERS A COFFEE. YOU GET A LITTLE MORE EXCITED. IT IS A MISSING PERSON. NOW, TO SEARCH TO ANY CLUE AS TO MR. COKER'S DISAPPEARANCE. STEPS BACK TO A STAND UP COUNTER, PUTS HIS COFFEE DOWN AND GETS ON HIS CELLPHONE. AND HE STARTS WRITING SOMETHING DOWN. JONES REPLAYS THE TAPE. HE WANTS TO SEE IF HE CAN MAKE OUT WHAT DOUG IS WRITING. THE VIDEO IS TOO FAR AWAY. HE CAN'T TELL WHAT IT IS. MOMENTS LATER, DOUG SIMPLY WALKS OUT. THE LAST TIME THEY KNOW THAT HE IS SEEN FOR CERTAIN IS AT THAT McDONALD'S. THIS IS THE LAST KNOWN IMAGE OF DOUG COKER. POLICE WONDER WHO CALLED DOUG, AND DO THEY KNOW WHERE HE IS? THEY REVIEW THE FOOTAGE AGAIN TO NOTE THE TIME OF THE CALL. IT'S AT 11:04 A.M. THE CALL LASTS THREE MINUTES AND 20 SECONDS. THE NEXT STEP IS FOR POLICE TO SUBPOENA DOUG'S PHONE RECORDS TO FIGURE OUT WHO CALLED. WHILE THEY'RE WAITING, THEY TRY TO FIND OUT MORE ON THE MEETING DOUG SKIPPED OUT ON. IT SEEMS DOUG WAS SCHEDULED TO HAVE A MEETING WITH A WOMAN NAMED PAMELA MOSS, WHO IS AN EXPERT IN SECURING GRANTS FOR CHARITABLE PROJECTS. SHE'S BEEN WORKING WITH DOUG FOR SIX MONTHS ON ONE PROJECT IN PARTICULAR. SHE STARTED TALKING WITH HIM ABOUT THE HOMES THAT HE OWNED AND RENTED OUT AND TURN IT INTO A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT SOLD THESE HOUSES TO UNDERPRIVILEGED PEOPLE. MR. COKER WAS VERY KINDHEARTED, AND HE WANTED TO GIVE BACK. HE'S ALREADY PUT $85,000 INTO THE PROJECT. JUDY HASN'T MET PAM BUT KNOWS THAT DOUG THINKS HIGHLY OF HER. THIS LADY, EXTREMELY NICE, SOFT-SPOKEN. SHE GOES TO BIBLE STUDY ALL THE TIME. WE WERE REALLY WANTING TO GET IN TOUCH WITH MS. MOSS. WHEN THE SUBPOENAED PHONE RECORDS ARRIVE, POLICE CROSS REFERENCE THE TIME OF THE CALL FROM THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO TO HIS CELLPHONE RECORDS. IT BELONGS TO PAMELA MOSS. POLICE NEED TO SPEAK TO HER, AND SHE AGREES TO MEET WITH A DETECTIVE IN A COFFEE SHOP. HE BEGAN JUST TO ASK HER BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE MR. COKER WAS, IF THEY MET. PAMELA EXPLAINED SHE CALLED TO SAY SHE WAS RUNNING LATE AND GOT TO THE PARKING LOT AS DOUG WAS LEAVING McDONALD'S WITH HIS CUP OF COFFEE. THEY SPOKE BRIEFLY BEFORE PARTING COMPANY. IT'S A LAST SIGHTING, BUT POLICE ARE NO CLOSER TO FINDING DOUG. DOUG COKER HAS BEEN MISSING FOR FOUR DAYS. WITH NO NEW LEADS, POLICE WANT TO GO OVER MORE DETAILS WITH PAM. IF THE CALL WAS ABOUT HER RUNNING LATE, WHAT WAS DOUG WRITING DOWN? HE WASN'T ANSWERING HER PHONE, YOU START LOOKING HARDER, TRYING TO FIND CLUES OR ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS AND SO FORTH OF TRYING TO FIND HER. BUT SHE'S GONE MISSING. POLICE SEARCH FOR ANY FRIENDS OR FAMILY WHO KNOW WHERE SHE COULD BE. THEY FIND THAT SHE HAS A SISTER. A HALF-SISTER NAMED CAROLYN. THE POLICE HAD CALLED ME AND JUST WANTED TO TALK WITH PAM, BUT I TOLD THEM, I SAID, "WELL, I HAVEN'T SEEN PAM." BUT I TALK WITH HER EVERY DAY, SOMETIMES SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. NOW, SHE APPEARS TO BE GONE WITHOUT A TRACE. POLICE NOW HAVE TWO MISSING PERSONS -- DOUG COKER AND HIS CHARITY PARTNER, PAMELA MOSS. ARE THEY TOGETHER, OR HAS THEIR BUSINESS DEAL GONE SOUR? DETECTIVE JONES CHECKS OUT HER ADDRESS. SHE WAS NOT AT HOME. JUST AS HE'S ABOUT TO LEAVE, SOMETHING CATCHES HIS EYE. A RECEIPT. FOR SOME REASON, IT HAD BLOWN OUT INTO THE GRASS. THE RECEIPT IS A KROGER RECEIPT. AND KROGER IS A LOCAL CHAIN FOR -- FOR GROCERY STORES. AND ON THE RECEIPT, IT'S DATED THE TIME THAT SHE WAS IN THE STORE. 12:45 P.M. ON MARCH 14th -- THE DAY AFTER DOUG'S DISAPPEARANCE. WHAT COULD IT MEAN? THE DETECTIVE IS SURE OF ONE THING -- A LARGE STORE LIKE KROGER USES SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY. MAYBE THE STORE VIDEO WILL SHED SOME LIGHT ON THIS INCREASINGLY STRANGE CASE. THE BEST TIME TO GET SURVEILLANCE VIDEOS IS AS QUICK AS YOU FIND OUT THEY MAY EXIST, BECAUSE OFTENTIMES THEY ARE QUICKLY TAPED OVER. DETECTIVES PULL UP THE FOOTAGE FROM THE FIRST CAMERA A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE TIME STAMP ON THE RECEIPT. AND THERE SHE IS. THE CAMERA CAPTURES PAMELA MOSS WALKING INTO THE STORE WITH A SHOPPING CART. THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE AT THE KROGER GROCERY STORE SHOWS A TIME FRAME OF WHERE SHE WAS AND WHAT ALL SHE BOUGHT. THERE ARE SEVERAL CAMERAS THROUGHOUT THE STORE. THEY WILL SHOW DETECTIVE JONES EXACTLY WHAT PAMELA MOSS WAS BUYING. SHE BOUGHT CHICKEN SALAD AND SOME SMALL TUPPERWARE CONTAINERS. IN OTHER WORDS, A VERY ORDINARY STORE RUN. THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS RUN AWAY WITH DOUG COKER. POLICE SEE IF THEY CAN SPOT DOUG TOO. HE'S NOT THERE. IT'S NOT MUCH OF A LEAD UNTIL POLICE NOTICE WHAT SHE BUYS NEXT. SHE PURCHASES A COUPLE BOTTLES OF BLEACH, AND SHE ALSO PURCHASES SOME OF THE YELLOW GLOVES THAT PEOPLE USE TO CLEAN WITH. THIS ISN'T SINISTER, BUT WITH DOUG COKER MISSING AND NOW PAMELA MOSS VANISHED, DETECTIVE JONES IS ON HIGH ALERT FOR EVEN THE SMALLEST CLUES. OF COURSE, THE CLOROX BOTTLES, BEING CLEANING PRODUCTS, WANTING TO HIDE SOMETHING OR CLEAN UP. THANKS TO THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO, HE HAS TWO TIME POINTS FOR PAMELA MOSS -- WHEN SHE CALLED DOUG COKER AT McDONALD'S AND WHEN SHE IS AT KROGER. BUT WHAT WAS SHE DOING IN-BETWEEN? PAMELA HAS MORE QUESTIONS TO ANSWER. DETECTIVE JONES HEADS TO HER HOME. WHEN HE GETS THERE, IT'S PLUNGED IN DARKNESS. UP NEXT, DETECTIVES IN CALIFORNIA TRACK DOWN A COLD-HEARTED KILLER FROM CLUES FOUND ON SECURITY CAMERAS. DOUG COKER HAS BEEN MISSING FOR FIVE DAYS. POLICE USE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO TO PLACE HIM AT A McDONALD'S. HE HASN'T BEEN SEEN SINCE. NOW, HIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATE, PAMELA MOSS, HAS ALSO GONE MISSING. BUT DETECTIVE JONES HAS A BAD FEELING ABOUT IT AND RETURNS TO HER HOUSE TO INVESTIGATE. ALL THE LIGHTS WERE OUT. I SHINED MY FLASHLIGHT IN THERE. WE'RE TALKING 11:30 AT NIGHT. YOU'RE WONDERING ABOUT YOUR OWN SAFETY. VERY SCARY. I APPROACHED THE HOUSE SHINING MY LIGHT TO SEE IF I COULD SEE HER IN THERE. COULD NOT SEE OR FIND ANYTHING. WENT AROUND THE BACK OF THE HOUSE. COULD SMELL A STRONG, FOUL ODOR. ANY POLICEMAN KNOWS WHAT THAT SMELL MEANS. IT'S A DEAD BODY. HE'S FOUND DOUG COKER. AND I KNEW IT WAS HIM FROM CLOTHING DESCRIPTION. SO I'M IN SHOCK. HE NEEDS BACKUP, AND NOW. THIS IS JONES. I NEED BACK UP. OFFICERS ARRIVE QUICKLY, READY TO ENTER THE BUILDING, WHEN SUDDENLY THERE IS MOVEMENT IN THE HOUSE. THE LIGHT COME ON UPSTAIRS, THEN GO OFF. AND THEN, ONE WOULD COME ON DOWNSTAIRS. GUNS DRAWN, THEY APPROACH THE HOUSE CAUTIOUSLY. AS THEY GET CLOSER, A NEW SMELL HITS THEM. YOU COULD SMELL A REAL STRONG ODOR COMING AROUND FROM WINDOWS AND THE DOORS. THE SMELL IS THE THICK STENCH OF NATURAL GAS. IT WAS BURNING MY EYES. YOU COULD ACTUALLY HEAR IT RUNNING THROUGH THE FIREPLACE. THERE'S NO ONE HOME. BUT OFFICERS DO NOTICE SOMETHING STRANGE -- THE LIVING ROOM LIGHTS ARE FIXED TO TIMERS. IT'S A CRUDE ATTEMPT AT SABOTAGE. SHE WANTED THE LIGHT TO COME ON AND IGNITE THE GAS THAT SHE HAD LEFT ON INSIDE THE HOUSE TO BURN THE HOUSE DOWN. IF THE GAS WAS TO BLOW THE HOUSE UP, IT MEANT PAMELA MOSS WANTED TO DESTROY THE EVIDENCE. SO, WHAT ELSE IS SHE TRYING TO HIDE? TODAY IS MONDAY, MARCH 19, 2012. WE'RE HERE TO SERVE A SEARCH WARRANT. IT IS IN REFERENCE TO A MURDER INVESTIGATION. A QUICK LOOK UP UNDER IT, REVEALED WHAT WE BELIEVE MAY BE BLOOD STAINS IN THE CARPET. LARGE AREA STAIN HERE. AND THEY FIND THE SAME CLEANING PRODUCTS PAM WAS SEEN BUYING ON THE TAPE. OVER HERE ON THE COUNTER, A BOTTLE OF CLOROX ULTIMATE CARE BLEACH SITTING OUT ON THE COUNTER. AND THE MURDER WEAPON. POLICE OFFICERS HEAD TO THE COKER HOUSE TO LET JUDY KNOW THE SEARCH FOR HER HUSBAND HAS COME TO A TERRIBLE END. IT WASN'T OVER. IT WAS, LIKE, ONLY BEGINNING AS FAR AS ALL OF THE, HEARTBREAK AND DEVASTATION THAT YOU FEEL WHEN YOU LOSE SOMEONE LIKE THAT. MEANWHILE, DETECTIVE JONES GETS A CALL FROM THE LOCAL HOSPITAL. PAMELA MOSS HAS BEEN ADMITTED AFTER ATTEMPTING SUICIDE. POLICE ARREST HER. SHE PLEADS INSANITY, BUT IT'S ALL AN ACT. IT WAS A SCAM ALL ALONG. SHE KNEW DOUG COKER WAS A WEALTHY LOCAL BUSINESSMAN, AND HER PLAN WAS TO DEFRAUD HIM. HE REALIZED THAT SHE HAD LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT SHE HAD PROPOSED TO DO. FEARING DOUG WAS ONTO HER, PAMELA MOSS CALLED HIM AT THE McDONALD'S AND ARRANGED FOR HIM TO COME TO HER HOME. MR. COKER WAS STRUCK IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD THREE TIMES. WHEN POLICE ARREST HER THEY DISCOVER SHE USED TO BE CALLED PAMELA FRYE AND HAD MURDERED HER MOTHER FOR THE INHERITANCE. PAMELA MOSS WAS A SERIAL SCAMMER, AND NOW A SERIAL KILLER. I THINK THAT THE ONLY APPROPRIATE SENTENCE FOR HER IS THAT SHE NEVER BE ALLOWED INTO SOCIETY AGAIN. I DON'T WANT HER TO EVER BE FREE AGAIN. PAMELA MOSS IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT PAROLE. CAMERAS HAVE BROUGHT JUSTICE TO DOUG COKER'S FAMILY. MEANWHILE, 2,000 MILES AWAY, VIDEO IS ROLLING ON THE FRINGES OF ANOTHER CRIME. OXNARD, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. DETECTIVE MIKE YOUNG IS GETTING READY FOR WORK. YOU FIRST. I RECEIVED A CALL ABOUT SIX IN THE MORNING. WHEN THE PHONE RINGS THIS EARLY, IT'S NEVER GOOD NEWS. HELLO? A WOMAN HAS BEEN FOUND MURDERED, AND YOUNG HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO LEAD THE INVESTIGATION. SHE WAS ONLY PARTIALLY CLOTHED. HER PANTS AND SHOES AND, SWEATER HAD BEEN REMOVED. HER SHIRT WAS PULLED UP PARTIALLY OVER HER BREASTS. HER PANTIES WERE PULLED DOWN. IN THE FIRST FEW MINUTES AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE CRIME SCENE, YOU GET A REAL GOOD FEEL FOR, POTENTIALLY, WHAT HAPPENED, ESPECIALLY IN A CASE LIKE THIS. AS SOON AS DETECTIVE WERE ON SCENE, THEY IMMEDIATELY HAD SUSPICIONS THAT THIS WAS A SEXUAL ASSAULT. IT ALSO APPEARS SHE WAS STRANGLED WITH SOME SORT OF LIGATURE. AS INVESTIGATORS BEGIN PROCESSING THE SCENE FOR EVIDENCE, DETECTIVE YOUNG DISCOVERS THE POSSIBLE MURDER WEAPON. THERE WAS A PIECE OF GAUZE THAT WAS TIED TO THE CHAIN LINK FENCE. IT HAS BEEN TWISTED UP AND LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BROKEN. AND IT'S STAINED IN BLOOD. WHAT IT MEANS, INVESTIGATORS HAVE NO IDEA. BUT HOPEFULLY, IT CONTAINS SOME LEAD ON THE KILLER. IN MY OPINION, AT THAT POINT, IT HAD TO BE SOMEONE WHO WAS A SEXUAL DEVIANT AND WHO OBVIOUSLY HAD SOME SEXUAL OR ANGER -- ANGER ISSUES. I OFTEN THINK ABOUT HOW TERRIFIED THE VICTIM MAY HAVE BEEN IN HER LAST MOMENTS. BUT BEFORE DETECTIVES CAN GO SEARCHING FOR THE KILLER, THEY NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE VICTIM IS. SHE HAD NO IDENTIFICATION ON HER. AS HER HANDS ARE SEALED TO PRESERVE FORENSIC EVIDENCE, DETECTIVE YOUNG NOTICED A POSSIBLE CLUE. SHE HAD WHAT APPEARED TO BE A REAL RECENT LACERATION ON HER RIGHT HAND THAT HAD SOME STITCHES IN IT. WHICH MEANS SHE'S HAD A RECENT TRIP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. SO I CONTACTED THE LOCAL HOSPITALS. AND ONE OF THEM THINKS THEY KNOW WHO THE VICTIM IS -- A 23-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO CAME IN A FEW NIGHTS EARLIER -- LORENA GONZALES. NOW, DETECTIVE YOUNG MUST NOTIFY HER FAMILY. THAT'S THE -- THAT'S THE WORST PART OF THE JOB. I HEARD A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. AS I WENT TO GO TO THE FRONT DOOR, I SAW TWO DETECTIVES THERE. AND THE FIRST THING MY MOM SAID WAS, "WHAT DID SHE DO NOW?" JUST BECAUSE IN HER YOUNGER YEARS, SHE WAS IN TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE. HI, MS. GONZALES. I ASKED HER, YOU KNOW, IF HER DAUGHTER WAS LORENA. AND SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS. AND I TOLD HER HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN FOUND DECEASED THIS MORNING. NO. NO. SHE JUST -- AND, JUST START CRYING HYSTERICALLY, SAYING, "NO, NO, IT'S NOT -- THIS ISN'T REAL." SHE JUST KEPT SAYING, "MY BABY." IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW NOTIFICATIONS THAT I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER FORGET. I'M GETTING GOOSE BUMPS JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW -- IT -- IT WAS -- IT WAS TERRIBLE. YOU REALLY, REALLY, REALLY FELT FOR HER MOM. THERE'S -- THERE'S NOTHING I CAN SAY. IT'S JUST, WHAT AM I GONNA SAY. IT'S JUST, TOMORROW IS GONNA BE A BETTER DAY. IT'S GONNA BE EASY. IT'S NOT. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, LORENA WAS A SINGLE MOM TO TWO YOUNG GIRLS. MY MOM KEPT SAYING, "THE KIDS, THE KIDS." SHE DIDN'T CARE ANYTHING ELSE. SHE JUST WANTED TO BE THERE FOR THEM BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH SHE LOST A DAUGHTER, THEY LOST THEIR MOTHER, WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO RAISE THEM, GUIDE THEM AND SHOW THEM LIFE LESSONS TO HELP THEM OUT. COLORING? COLORING? BEING A FATHER MYSELF, THAT'S A -- THAT'S HARD TO -- HARD TO FATHOM. DETECTIVE YOUNG LEARNS THAT LORENA HAD GOT INTO TROUBLE WITH THE LAW AS A TEENAGER, BUT SHE'D WORKED HARD TO GET HER LIFE BACK ON TRACK WHEN IT WAS ALL CUT BRUTALLY SHORT. SO, UM, THERE'S THAT PART OF THIS STORY THAT I THINK REALLY DROVE US AS A UNIT TO TRY AND FIND -- FIND OUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. YOUNG ASKS THE FAMILY IF SHE HAS ANY ENEMIES OR A JEALOUS EX, BUT NOTHING COMES UP. HE TRIES TO PIECE TOGETHER HER LAST KNOWN MOVEMENTS. IDENTIFYING WHO SHE WAS WITH, THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL. THEY'RE GONNA BE AN EXTREMELY CRITICAL WITNESS WHO MAY HAVE EITHER WITNESSED A CRIME OR PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION AS TO WHO THE VICTIM WAS WITH OR SAW OR LEFT WITH RIGHT BEFORE THEIR DEATH. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW... YOUNG ASKS FAMILY MEMBERS IF ANY OF THEM KNEW WHERE LORENA HAD BEEN. WE CONDUCTED AN INTERVIEW WITH LORENA'S NIECE. SHE HAD INFORMED US THE PREVIOUS NIGHT LORENA WAS OVER AT THE SNOOKIES BAR ON SOUTH OXNARD BOULEVARD. SNOOKIES IS, UM, BASICALLY A STRIP JOINT WHERE THEY HAVE EXOTIC DANCERS, IN THE EVENING HOURS. LORENA HAD HEARD THEY WERE HIRING WAIT STAFF AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO BRING IN SOME EXTRA CASH. SHE HAD APPLIED FOR A JOB THERE, SO SHE WAS SPENDING SOME TIME THERE. SHE WAS HAVING SOME COCKTAILS THERE. DETECTIVE YOUNG FOLLOWS UP WITH A VISIT TO SNOOKIES. AND BEFORE HE EVEN SETS FOOD INSIDE, HE FINDS A POTENTIAL CLUE. THERE'S A WITNESS WHO MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE VICTIM IN THE HOURS BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED. LORENA GONZALES HAS BEEN FOUND MURDERED IN AN ALLEY IN OXNARD, CALIFORNIA, JUST HOURS AFTER VISITING A STRIP CLUB CALLED SNOOKIES. DETECTIVE MIKE YOUNG QUESTIONS THE MANAGER, AND HE CONFIRMS SHE WAS THERE. HE EXPLAINS SHE WAS IN THE BAR, CHATTING WITH A REGULAR NAMED JEREMY LEVRA. DETECTIVE YOUNG WOULD NOW LIKE TO PUT A FACE TO THE NAME. YOUNG ASKS THE MANAGER TO CHECK THE BAR'S SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS TO SEE IF THEY REVEAL THE FACE OF LORENA'S COMPANION, BUT THERE'S BAD NEWS. BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED STORAGE CAPACITY, HE MADE IT A HABIT OF DELETING ALL THE VIDEO IN THE MORNING FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT. EVERYTHING THAT THE CAMERA SAW THE NIGHT BEFORE HAS ALREADY BEEN WIPED CLEAN. IT IS A HUGE BLOW TO THE INVESTIGATION. IT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. NOW, HE'S GOT NOTHING, AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING. IT WAS A GENUINE WORRY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEXUAL DEVIANT BEHAVIOR OFTENTIMES ARE REPETITIVE OFFENDERS. DESPERATE TO HELP, THE MANAGER TRIES TO RETRIEVE THE WIPED VIDEO. IT DOESN'T WORK. BUT THEN, HE DOES FIND SOMETHING ELSE THAT CAN HELP. HE FOUND SOME STILL IMAGES FROM TWO NIGHTS PRIOR WHICH HAD ACTUALLY RECORDED ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT HE THOUGHT LORENA HAD BEEN WITH. THE STILL FRAME SHOWS A MAN ENTERING SNOOKIES. IT IS JEREMY LEVRA. HE SAID THAT HE BELIEVED THAT THE INDIVIDUAL LIVED IN THE GATEWAY APARTMENT COMPLEX ADJACENT TO THE BAR. THE FACT THAT HE WAS KNOWN TO BE WITH HER IN THE HOURS THAT LEAD UP TO HER DEATH CERTAINLY MADE HIM A PERSON OF INTEREST AT A MINIMUM. DETECTIVE YOUNG INVESTIGATES. AS I WAS WALKING FROM THE BAR, THE PERSON WHO CLOSELY RESEMBLED THE PERSON IN THE PICTURE WAS ACTUALLY STANDING OUT IN FRONT OF THE APARTMENT COMPLEX. IT IS JEREMY, AND HE READILY ADMITS TO BEING AT THE BAR WITH LORENA THE NIGHT BEFORE. HE SAID THAT HE WAS TRYING TO TEACH HER HOW TO PLAY POOL AND HE WAS, HAVING SOME BEERS WITH HER. JEREMY SAYS ANOTHER MAN WAS WITH THEM AND THAT THE THREE OF THEM LEFT THE BAR, WENT TO A LIQUOR STORE, THEN BACK TO JEREMY'S APARTMENT, WHERE THEY PARTIED TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE GUY DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO STAY AND JEREMY HAD INVITED HIM TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN HIS APARTMENT. BUT JEREMY SAYS BOTH THE MAN AND LORENA LEFT BEFORE 1:00 A.M. DETECTIVE YOUNG NEEDS TO VERIFY JEREMY'S STORY. IS HE LYING TO COVER HIS OWN TRACKS? FIRST STOP -- THE LIQUOR STORE. WE COLLECTED VIDEO FROM THE LIQUOR STORE THAT'S ADJACENT TO THE -- TO THE BAR. HE LOOKS THROUGH HOURS OF FOOTAGE, BUT THE IMAGES ARE POOR. EVENTUALLY, HE SEES LORENA... SHE WAS IN AND OUT OF THE LIQUOR STORE THAT'S ADJACENT TO THE BAR A COUPLE OF TIMES. ...AND JEREMY. THERE WAS VIDEO SURVEILLANCE, I BELIEVE, OF JEREMY INSIDE THE STORE. AT 10:30 P.M., HE FINALLY SEES WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR -- LORENA AND JEREMY TOGETHER. SHE BUYS SOME CANDY. HE BUYS SOME BEER. IF THERE IS A THIRD MAN WITH THEM, HE DOESN'T APPEAR ON CAMERA. DOES JEREMY HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO HIDE? YOUNG HEADS FOR JEREMY'S APARTMENT BUILDING AND SPOTS SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP IN THE INVESTIGATION -- MORE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. HE ASKS THE MANAGER TO PULL THE VIDEO. SOMETIMES, IT'S EXTREMELY HELPFUL. BUT THEN, YOU ALWAYS FEAR THAT THE RECORDING DEVICE WASN'T WORKING, OR IT'S AN OLD TAPE SYSTEM AND THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE IT OUT. THIS TIME, HE'S IN LUCK, AND DETECTIVE YOUNG SOON LEARNS THAT JEREMY HAS BEEN TELLING THE TRUTH. SO WE'RE ABLE TO SEE THAT JEREMY, LORENA, AND THE UNKNOWN MALE, ALL THREE COME INTO THE APARTMENT COMPLEX TOGETHER. THERE IS A MYSTERY MAN, BUT IT'S HARD TO MAKE OUT HIS FACE. THE QUALITY OF THE -- OF THE VIDEO WAS OKAY. I DON'T THINK THAT IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO WHERE IF YOU LOOKED AT IT AND THEN YOU LOOKED AT A PICTURE OF THE PERSON, YOU COULD DEFINITIVELY SAY THAT THAT'S HIM. BUT HE IS WEARING A DISTINCTIVE CAMOUFLAGE OUTFIT. JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT, HE, LORENA AND JEREMY HEAD INTO THE APARTMENT. TWENTY MINUTES LATER, HE STEPS OUT. THE UNKNOWN MALE ACTUALLY WENT DOWN TO THE LAUNDRY ROOM AREA OF THE, APARTMENT COMPLEX. THEN, HE DOES SOMETHING REALLY ODD, USING WHAT LOOKS LIKE A BROOM HANDLE TO WEDGE THE DOOR. BUT WHY? IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S TRYING TO KEEP IT OPEN SO HE CAN GET BACK IN THE BUILDING. THIS DOOR WAS EQUIPPED WITH AN ALARM TYPE DEVICE THAT WOULD ALERT IF THE DOOR WAS LEFT OPEN FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME, SO WE'RE DRAWING THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ALARM ACTUALLY WAS AUDIBLE AND WENT OFF, SO HE DIDN'T KEEP THE DOOR OPEN. SUSPICIOUS INDEED. THE MAN THEN RETURNS TO THE APARTMENT UNTIL 12:46, WHEN JEREMY SAYS THE PARTY ENDED. THE UNKNOWN MALE AND LORENA ARE RECORDED WALKING OUT OF THE APARTMENT COMPLEX TOGETHER. THERE'S NOTHING TOO TELLING ABOUT THEIR BODY LANGUAGE OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT IT APPEARS THAT LORENA LEFT THE APARTMENT WITH THE UNKNOWN MALE VOLUNTARILY. IT'S SURREAL. YOU LOOK AT THE VIDEO, AND YOU SEE A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAS NO CLUE THAT, MINUTES FROM THAT MOMENT, SHE'LL BE FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE AND WILL DIE. IT'S A VERY POWERFUL IMAGE, AND IT MAKES YOU REALIZE THAT YOU -- YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THE NEXT MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE IS REALLY GOING TO BRING. IT'S MY BELIEF THAT SHE WAS KILLED SHORTLY AFTER THAT VIDEO WAS RECORDED. INVESTIGATORS SUSPECT THE MAN IN THE CAMOUFLAGE JACKET IS A SEXUAL PREDATOR AND COLD-BLOODED KILLER. WILL THEY CATCH HIM BEFORE HE GOES HUNTING AGAIN? SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE HAS GIVEN DETECTIVE MIKE YOUNG A GLIMPSE INTO LORENA GONZALES'S LAST NIGHT ALIVE. SO NOW, WE KNEW WHERE SHE WAS AT 12:45 IN THE MORNING. WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW IS WHERE SHE WAS FROM 12:45 IN THE MORNING UNTIL 5:30 IN THE MORNING WHEN WE WERE CALLED. ALL THEY HAVE IS A PICTURE OF AN UNKNOWN MAN ON A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE WAS, BUT WE HAD IMAGES OF HIM. AND THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO LORENA NEXT -- SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND STRANGLED TO DEATH. STRANGULATION BY LIGATURE IS RELATIVELY RARE, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ALWAYS TAKES NOTICE OF THAT. YOUNG GOES LOOKING FOR ANY CRIMES WITH THE SAME M.O. AND HE'S IN LUCK WITH A MAN ARRESTED A FEW HOURS AFTER LORENA'S BODY WAS DISCOVERED. WHILE HE HAD BEEN IN THE HOLDING FACILITY -- IN THE BOOKING AREA OF THE VENTURA COUNTY JAIL, HE HAD ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED TO STRANGLE ANOTHER INMATE WITH HIS SHOE LACES. HE BECAME ENRAGED AND DECIDED HE HAD TO KILL. THE FACT THAT HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO STRANGLE SOMEBODY IN THE JAIL, HE CERTAINLY BECAME A PERSON OF INTEREST. HIS NAME IS DANIEL MARTINEZ. IN THE BOOKING PHOTOGRAPH, HE HAPPENED TO BE WEARING THE SAME JACKET THAT THE PERSON THAT LORENA LEFT THE APARTMENT COMPLEX WITH WAS WEARING. NOT ONLY HAD HE TRIED TO STRANGLE HIS CELL MATE, HE HAD ATTACKED A MAN IN THE STREET WITH A BOTTLE JUST HOURS AFTER LORENA WAS MURDERED. IT WAS, YOU KNOW, JUST OUT OF THE TWILIGHT ZONE. WHEN YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER AND YOU REALIZE, "WOW, THIS GUY WAS ON A KILLING SPREE, AND I DIDN'T KNOW IT." NOBODY KNEW IT. YOUNG IS EAGER TO SEE WHAT THE SUSPECT HAS TO SAY FOR HIMSELF. HE STARTED OUT INITIALLY LYING, DENYING THAT HE WAS WITH ANYONE. WE GOT TO THE POINT THAT HE ACTUALLY ADMITTED TO HAVING LEFT THE APARTMENT COMPLEX WITH LORENA. I TOLD HIM THAT I KNEW SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THE ALLEYWAY. I ASKED HIM WHAT HAPPENED. HE HAD REMOVED THE GAUZE FROM THE RECENT LACERATION ON HER HAND, HAD PUT THAT AROUND HER NECK. AND THEN, AS HE SAID, HE, "FINISHED THE JOB." IT'S -- IT'S DISTURBING, AND IT'S TRAGIC. SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO DIE. DANIEL MARTINEZ CONFESSES TO THE MURDER OF LORENA GONZALES. HE HAD A HISTORY OF DRUG USE AND WAS HIGH ON METHAMPHETAMINE WHEN HE KILLED LORENA. HE IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT PAROLE. KNOWING WHAT HE DID, THERE'S AN ENORMOUS SENSE OF RELIEF. YOU'RE RELIEVED THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO TELL THE FAMILY THAT YOU'VE GOT THE PERSON THAT TOOK THEIR LOVED ONE AWAY FROM THEM. ONE PERSON WILL NEVER BE OUT TO HURT ANYBODY ELSE. NOW, LORENA'S LITTLE BROTHER, LORENZO GONZALES, IS THE FULL LEGAL GUARDIAN OF HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN. I BELIEVE THERE'S GOODNESS THAT COMES OUT OF ANYTHING. JUST LOOK AT MY NIECES AND SEE HOW MY FAMILY CAME TOGETHER TO TRY AND BE THE BEST FAMILY THAT WE CAN FOR THEM. INVESTIGATORS 2,000 MILES APART STOPPED KILLERS IN THEIR TRACKS THANKS TO THE POWER OF SURVEILLANCE VIDEO. HAVING VIDEO SURVEILLANCE IN THIS CASE WAS CRUCIAL TO US. IF YOU HAVE VIDEO ON A CRIME, THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT YOU'LL SOLVE IT. SURVEILLANCE VIDEO IS VERY, VERY, VERY POWERFUL EVIDENCE. IT'S GOLD. MEANWHILE, THE CAMERAS KEEP WATCHING.
