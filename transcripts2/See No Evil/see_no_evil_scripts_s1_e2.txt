 THIS IS THE REAL THING. ...THREATENING EVERYONE WEARING A BADGE. IT'S SUNDAY EVENING, AND THE STREETS ARE ESPECIALLY QUIET. IT WAS SUPER BOWL SUNDAY. LIKE MOST PEOPLE, I ENJOYED THE GAME, AND IT WAS JUST WRAPPING UP. IT WAS JUST AFTER 9:00 THAT NIGHT. I WAS AT HOME SITTING ON MY COUCH, WATCHING TELEVISION. BUT THEIR PEACE IS ABOUT TO BE SHATTERED WHEN A WOMAN ACROSS TOWN MAKES A SHOCKING DISCOVERY. POLICE RACE TO THE SCENE, NOT KNOWING IF THEY'RE DRIVING INTO AN AMBUSH OR TO A RESCUE. THE LOT LOOKS CLEAR -- NO SHOOTER.

 BUT THE VICTIMS CLEARLY BEYOND HELP. DETECTIVES ARE IMMEDIATELY CALLED IN. WHEN I GOT THERE -- THE CRIMES HAD HAPPENED UP ON THE TOP FLOOR OF THE PARKING STRUCTURE. AND IT WAS A BIT UNIQUE. IT WAS SURROUNDED ON TWO SIDES BY HIGH-RISE, LUXURY CONDOMINIUMS. A BRAZEN SPOT FOR A MURDER. IT ALSO APPEARS THE TWO VICTIMS HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE. THERE WAS QUITE A LONG CONDENSATION TRAIL FROM THE AIR CONDITIONING OF THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN LEFT RUNNING. THE DOORS WERE CLOSED. THE BULLETS, AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THE WINDOW, OBVIOUSLY, SHATTERED THE WINDOW, BUT THE GLASS WAS STILL IN PLACE IN THE DOOR FRAME. SO THE DOORS HAVE NEVER BEEN OPENED, AND THAT TELLS DETECTIVES SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS CRIME SCENE. THEIR CELLPHONES WERE STILL PRESENT. THE FEMALE'S PURSE WAS STILL THERE, AND SHE HAD A LARGE RING ON HER HAND THAT DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE DISTURBED. IT APPEARED THAT ROBBERY WAS NOT THE MOTIVE. IT APPEARED THAT THEY HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY SURPRISE. THEY FIND 14 SHELL CASINGS AROUND THE VEHICLE. AS WE PROCESSED THE SCENE, ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAD WHEN WE SAW THAT THERE WERE 14 SHELL CASINGS ON THE GROUND WAS, "DID ALL OF THOSE COME FROM ONE GUN?" SUGGESTING THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE SHOOTER -- OR DID THOSE CASINGS, WERE THEY FIRED FROM MORE THAN ONE WEAPON? AND IF ROBBERY ISN'T THE MOTIVE, THEN WHAT IS? IT DIDN'T APPEAR THAT ANY OF THE ROUNDS THAT WERE FIRED WENT ANYWHERE OTHER THAN INSIDE THE CAR. IT WAS VERY COLD-BLOODED. IT SEEMED LIKE A VERY COLD CRIME. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BY HAPPENSTANCE. THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE TARGETED. THESE FOLKS WERE AMBUSHED. BUT WHO ARE THESE VICTIMS? WE RAN THE LICENSE PLATE ON THE VEHICLE THAT THEY WERE IN, AND IT CAME BACK REGISTERED TO KEITH LAWRENCE. WE WERE ABLE TO PULL UP A DRIVER'S-LICENSE PHOTOGRAPH AND COMPARE THAT TO THE PERSON WHO WAS IN THE CAR AND MAKE AN IDENTIFICATION OF HIM PRETTY QUICKLY. HE'S A COP -- 27-YEAR-OLD KEITH LAWRENCE, A POLICE OFFICER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH AN EXEMPLARY RECORD. BUT THEY STILL DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE WOMAN DEAD IN HIS PASSENGER SEAT. OFFICERS QUICKLY FAN OUT THROUGH THE NEARBY APARTMENT BUILDINGS, LOOKING FOR WITNESSES. WE KNOCKED ON DOORS. WE DID NEIGHBORHOOD CANVASES. LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE HOME. WINDOWS WOULD BE OPEN. SLIDING GLASS DOORS WOULD BE OPEN. PEOPLE MIGHT BE OUT ON THEIR DECKS THAT OVERLOOK THIS PARKING STRUCTURE, YET WE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO WITNESSES. SUPER BOWL SUNDAY OR NOT, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE 14 GUNSHOTS WENT UNNOTICED... ...UNLESS THE SHOOTER USED A SILENCER. THE CRIME LAB FAIRLY QUICKLY WAS ABLE TO TELL US THAT ALL 14 OF THOSE CASINGS CAME FROM A SINGLE GUN AND THAT THE BARREL ON THAT GUN WAS ONE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE FITTED WITH A SUPPRESSOR. IN MY 15-YEAR CAREER, I'D NEVER HEARD OF THAT HAPPENING, CERTAINLY NOT IN IRVINE. WE SURMISED THAT THEY HAD ARRIVED, PARKED THEIR VEHICLE. SOMEBODY WAS LYING IN WAIT FOR THEM AND SHOT THEM IN THE VEHICLE BEFORE THEY EVEN HAD THE CHANCE TO GET OUT. IT'S A TERRIFYING SCENARIO. A COP-KILLER IS ON THE LOOSE USING SPECIALIZED WEAPONS. 40 MILES AWAY IN L.A., ANOTHER POLICEMAN, RETIRED CAPTAIN RANDY QUAN, CAN'T GET THROUGH TO HIS 28-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, MONICA. IT WAS TYPICAL OF THE FAMILY TO TALK EVERY NIGHT. THEY BECAME CONCERNED. THEY SAW A BREAKING NEWS STORY THAT WE WERE INVESTIGATING A MURDER IN IRVINE. HE SAW THE COMMUNITY THAT WAS BEING PICTURED AND RECOGNIZED IT. IN FACT, MONICA'S BUILDING IS THE ONE PICTURED IN THE NEWS. NOW, PANIC IS REALLY SETTING IN. HE THEN CALLED THE IRVINE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND TOLD OUR DISPATCHERS THAT HE BELIEVED THAT MONICA MAY BE THE VICTIM OF THE HOMICIDE THAT WE WERE INVESTIGATING. AND BASED ON HIS DESCRIPTION, INVESTIGATORS THINK HE'S RIGHT. INCREDIBLY TOUGH FOR A FATHER. STILL IN A STATE OF SHOCK, RANDY AND HIS WIFE GET TO THE STATION AS FAST AS THEY CAN. A LOT OF US INVESTIGATING THE CASE HAD KIDS, AND YOU FEEL THAT EMOTIONAL CONNECTION, YOU FEEL THAT PERSONAL CONNECTION, AND YOU FEEL FOR RANDY QUAN AND WHAT HE MUST BE GOING THROUGH. QUAN SAYS THAT MONICA AND KEITH HAD GOTTEN ENGAGED JUST DAYS EARLIER. WILL YOU MARRY ME? YES! AS YOU START TO HEAR BITS AND PIECES ABOUT THEIR LIVES AND THEIR RECENT ENGAGEMENT, I THINK THE TRAGEDY JUST WEIGHED HEAVIER AND HEAVIER. THE MORE YOU GOT TO KNOW THEM, THE MORE YOU GET AN EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO THEM. SO, WHO WOULD WANT THIS HAPPY, YOUNG COUPLE DEAD? IT'S A QUESTION NO ONE CAN SEEM TO ANSWER. OUR DETECTIVES BECAME FRUSTRATED IN THE EARLY HOURS NOT KNOWING WHO THE SUSPECT WAS, A REDOUBLING OF THEIR EFFORTS, PURSING SO MANY DIFFERENT AVENUES TRYING TO FIND WHAT COULD BE THE SUSPECT'S IDENTITY OR THE MOTIVE FOR THESE CRIMES. ONE POLICE OFFICER AND THE DAUGHTER OF ANOTHER HAVE BEEN EXECUTED. WITH THE CLOCK TICKING AND NO ANSWERS IN SIGHT, DETECTIVES GO HUNTING FOR A WITNESS THEY MAY HAVE OVERLOOKED. WE WANTED TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY CLOSED-CIRCUIT SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS IN THE AREA. A SEARCH OF THE PARKING LOT TURNS UP NOTHING. WHERE THE CRIME OCCURRED DID NOT HAVE ANY SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. SO THEY WIDEN THEIR SEARCH TO THE APARTMENT BUILDINGS NEARBY. AND SUDDENLY, A RAY OF HOPE -- A SINGLE CAMERA. IT IS TRAINED ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE APARTMENT BUILDING. WILL IT REVEAL WHO KILLED MONICA QUAN AND KEITH LAWRENCE? THE DOUBLE MURDER OF OFFICER KEITH LAWRENCE AND HIS FIANCéE, MONICA QUAN, HERSELF A POLICE OFFICER'S DAUGHTER, HAS IRVINE P.D. BAFFLED. BUT NOW THEY FIND THEIR FIRST POTENTIAL WITNESS. WE DID FIND SOME SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS ACROSS THE STREET. BUT IT WILL TAKE HOURS TO OBTAIN THE TAPES AND SCROLL THROUGH THE FOOTAGE. IN THE MEANTIME, DETECTIVES DELVE INTO THE COUPLE'S BACKGROUNDS. WE LEARNED THAT MONICA AND KEITH HAD BEEN ENGAGED WITHIN DAYS OF THEIR MURDER. AND CERTAINLY, IT WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T LOOK INTO THAT. WE STARTED LOOKING INTO THEIR PAST DATING HISTORY, WHO THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH BEFORE THEY WERE A COUPLE. BUT THEY CAN'T FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF A JEALOUS EX ON EITHER SIDE. KEITH LAWRENCE WAS A PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER FOR USC CAMPUS SAFETY. WE BEGAN TO EXPLORE PERHAPS THIS WAS RELATED TO HIS WORK. WE LOOKED AT FOLKS THAT WORKED WITH MONICA QUAN. BUT AGAIN, THERE'S NO HISTORY OF TROUBLE ON THE JOB. WE SPOKE WITH RANDY QUAN, AND HE COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING IN HIS PAST CAREER WORKING FOR THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THIS. EACH OF THESE INVESTIGATIVE THEORIES THAT WE WERE LOOKING INTO DIDN'T PAN OUT. IT COULD BE THE KILLER WAS A STRANGER. WE WERE TRYING TO LOOK AT ALL POSSIBILITIES. WE CHECKED WITH OUR SURROUNDING JURISDICTIONS TO SEE IF THEY HAD HAD ANY REPORTS OF ROAD-RAGE INCIDENTS, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF PERHAPS THAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THIS HOMICIDE. BUT INVESTIGATORS KEEP DRAWING BLANKS. THEIR ONLY HOPE NOW IS THAT THE VIDEO WILL GIVE THEM A LEAD. THE WAIT TO VIEW IT IS AGONY. 90 MILES AWAY, IN NATIONAL CITY, ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF SAN DIEGO, THERE'S A STRANGE DISCOVERY AT A CAR-AUDIO STORE THAT SEEMS COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO THE DOUBLE HOMICIDE IN IRVINE. ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES WAS TAKING OUT THE TRASH TO THEIR DUMPSTER. HE OPENED A LID, WHERE HE SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE SOME DISCARDED POLICE-TYPE PROPERTY. BECAUSE HE WORKS UNDERCOVER, DETECTIVE PAUL HERNANDEZ MUST KEEP HIS APPEARANCE A SECRET. I WAS AT THE STATION AT THE TIME I HEARD THE CALL REGARDING THE SUSPICIOUS ITEMS IN THE DUMPSTER ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. THERE WAS A DUTY BELT, HANDCUFFS, BATON, BATON HOLSTER, AND A PISTOL HOLSTER. THERE WAS AMMO -- 9mm AND.22 AMMO, MAYBE 50, 60 ROUNDS OF EACH -- PIECES OF TACTICAL EQUIPMENT, SOME DROP POUCHES, WHICH ARE FOR RIFLE MAGAZINES. THERE WAS SOME CAMO PAINT. THERE WAS A STEEL RIFLE PLATE, WHICH IS AN INSERT FOR BODY ARMOR. AND IT ISN'T JUST EQUIPMENT. THERE WAS A BLUE POLICE-TYPE UNIFORM. ON THE BUTTONS ON THE UNIFORM, IT ACTUALLY SAID "L.A. POLICE." MY FIRST REACTION -- "YES, THIS PROBABLY BELONGS "TO A LOS ANGELES POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS A VICTIM OF SOME TYPE OF THEFT." BUT L.A. IS OVER 120 MILES AWAY, A LONG WAY TO DUMP ITEMS FROM A THEFT. AND SOMETHING ELSE DOESN'T ADD UP. IT WAS VERY ODD, THOUGH, TO SEE AMMUNITION IN THE DUMPSTER. I MEAN, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT USUALLY PEOPLE WON'T GET RID OF BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TRACE AMMUNITION. DETECTIVE HERNANDEZ NOW HAS TO WONDER IF AN LAPD OFFICER MET A FATE WORSE THAN ROBBERY. I THINK ALL OF US IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, OR OFFICERS, YOU KNOW -- THAT'S OUR MAIN THING IS WE ARE CURIOUS. WE WANT TO BE NOSY. THAT'S OUR JOB. IN THE UNIFORM POCKET, HIS FIRST REAL LEAD. I DID LOCATE A POLICE NOTEPAD, WHICH MOST OF US CARRY. AND ON THAT, THERE WAS TWO NAMES -- DORNER AND EVANS. NATIONAL CITY POLICE FOLLOW UP WITH A CALL TO THE LAPD. THEY DID SAY THAT NO ONE WITH THE NAME DORNER WAS A CURRENT EMPLOYEE AT THEIR DEPARTMENT. THE NAME EVANS CAME BACK TO A SERGEANT WHO WORKS AT THEIR DEPARTMENT. SERGEANT EVANS EXPLAINS THE EQUIPMENT IS NOT HERS. IT COULD BE DORNER'S -- THAT'S A NAME SHE REMEMBERS. SHE WAS ACTUALLY HIS TRAINING OFFICER FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. DORNER HAD ACCUSED EVANS OF KICKING A MAN THEY WERE ARRESTING. BUT HE'D LODGED THE COMPLAINT WEEKS AFTER THE ALLEGED INCIDENT, ONLY AFTER SHE'D GIVEN HIM A POOR REPORT. AND HE WAS KIND OF A STRANGE GUY, BUT HE'S NO LONGER AT THE DEPARTMENT, AND SHE HAD NO WAY OF GETTING AHOLD OF HIM. THIS STRANGE DISCOVERY REMAINS UNCONNECTED TO THE PARKING LOT SLAYING -- FOR NOW. BACK IN IRVINE, COPS FINALLY HAVE THEIR HANDS ON THE SURVEILLANCE TAPE FROM THE BUILDING NEAREST THE CRIME SCENE. WE RECEIVED SOME OF THE CLOSED-CIRCUIT VIDEO. WHAT THEY'RE WATCHING FOR IS THE COUPLE'S WHITE 2013 KIA OPTIMA. THE CAMERAS HAD A PARTIAL VIEW OF THE ENTRANCE AND EXIT OF THE PARKING STRUCTURE. INCHING THROUGH THE FOOTAGE, INVESTIGATORS CAN'T SEE THE COUPLE PULLING IN. BUT THEY CAN STILL FIND OUT WHEN THAT HAPPENED. WHERE THE CRIME OCCURRED IS CONTROLLED BY ELECTRONIC ACCESS THROUGH A KEY CARD. AND WE WERE ABLE TO FIND OUT THAT KEITH AND MONICA ENTERED AT ABOUT 7:30 P.M. BUT AT 7:30 P.M., THE STREETS ARE EMPTY -- NO CARS, NO PEOPLE. EVERYONE IS WATCHING THE SUPER BOWL. NOT A SINGLE GLIMPSE OF THE KILLER. BUT ARE THERE CLUES HIDDEN IN THE GRAINY IMAGES? INVESTIGATORS SLOWLY WORK BACKWARDS, LOOKING FOR ANYTHING UNUSUAL. AT 3:13 P.M., A BLACK TRUCK DRIVES PAST THE BUILDING, THEN BACKS UP INTO A PARKING SPOT. ABOUT TWO HOURS LATER, THEY SEE IT PULLS OFF AGAIN RIGHT IN FRONT OF A WHITE CAR THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE VICTIMS'. CERTAINLY, WE FOUND THAT VERY INTERESTING. BUT WHAT COULD IT MEAN? THEY REWIND BACK TO 3:13 P.M. WHY THE LONG REVERSE? IS IT POSSIBLE THE DRIVER WAS SCOUTING OUT KEITH AND MONICA'S BUILDING? ADDING TO THEIR SUSPICION, INVESTIGATORS DISCOVER THAT AFTER PARKING THE TRUCK, NO ONE GETS OUT FOR THE ENTIRE TIME IT IS THERE. OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S SOMEONE IN THERE. OF COURSE, I WAS IMMEDIATELY FILLED WITH QUESTIONS OF JUST EXACTLY HOW IMPORTANT THAT WAS. BUT THE ONLY REAL LEAD THEY CAN GET IS JUST OUT OF THEIR REACH. THE CAMERA IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO PICK UP THE TRUCK'S LICENSE PLATE. CAN'T IT GET ANY BIGGER THAN THAT? I DON'T THINK SO. IT'S REALLY A VERY FRUSTRATING FEELING. DETECTIVES ARE CONVINCED THEY'RE ONTO SOMETHING. COULD THIS BE A KILLER STALKING HIS TARGET? IT IS AN OMINOUS LEAD. BUT WITHOUT ANY WAY TO IDENTIFY THE TRUCK, IRVINE POLICE ARE AT A DEAD END. THAT WAS A REAL STUNNER FOR US. IT CAUSED EVERYONE TO KIND OF REEL BACK ON THEIR HEELS AND THINK, "GEEZ, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?" THEN, FROM NOWHERE, A SHOCKING BREAKTHROUGH. AND THIS TIME, IT'S CAUGHT ON CAMERA. 36 HOURS AFTER MONICA QUAN AND KEITH LAWRENCE WERE GUNNED DOWN IN THEIR CAR IN IRVINE, CALIFORNIA, IT'S ALL ANYONE AT THE LAPD IS TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE MONICA'S DAD IS ONE OF THEIR OWN. PEOPLE STARTED WHISPERING IN THE HALLWAYS, "HEY, DID YOU HEAR THAT THAT WOMAN THAT WAS SHOT DOWN IN IRVINE WAS CAPTAIN QUAN'S DAUGHTER?" "WHY HER," YOU KNOW? WHY? THERE'S THAT KIND OF HEARTBREAK THAT YOU HAVE WHEN A FAMILY MEMBER, ONE OF YOUR POLICE BROTHERS OR SISTERS, LOSES A FAMILY MEMBER. IT HURTS ALL OF US. THIS POOR GUY'S DAUGHTER WAS BRUTALLY KILLED ALONG WITH HER FIANCé FOR APPARENTLY NO REASON. NO ROBBERY -- DONE WITH APPEARANCE OF SOME TYPE OF VENGEANCE. BUT SOMEONE'S STARTING TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER. LAPD SERGEANT TERRY EVANS, THE SAME OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN NOTIFIED ABOUT THE POLICE GEAR IN THE DUMPSTER, IS REMEMBERING SOMETHING. SHE CONNECTED THAT INFORMATION WITH THE PHONE CALL THAT SHE HAD GOT FROM THE NATIONAL CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT. THE NAME IN THE NOTEBOOK FROM A DUMPSTER, CHRISTOPHER DORNER, IS THE SAME AS HER FORMER TRAINEE. HE WAS ONLY A LOS ANGELES POLICE OFFICER FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. HE WENT THROUGH THE ACADEMY, HAD SOME DIFFICULTY THERE. HE GOT IN A FIGHT ONCE OR TWICE WITH SOME PEOPLE IN THE ACADEMY. AND HE SAID THAT HIS TRAINING OFFICER, TERRY EVANS, HAD KICKED AN INDIVIDUAL. DORNER'S FALSE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST EVANS LANDED HIM IN A HEARING BEFORE THE LAPD's BOARD OF RIGHTS, WHERE HE FAILED TO MAKE HIS CASE AND ENDED UP FIRED. SERGEANT EVANS THEN REMEMBERS SOMETHING TERRIFYING. CHRISTOPHER DORNER'S REPRESENTATIVE, WHO FAILED TO GET HIM ACQUITTED, IS SOMEONE SHE KNOWS -- SOMEONE CONNECTED TO THE VICTIM. SHE STARTED THINKING -- HIS REPRESENTATIVE AT THE BOARD OF RIGHTS WAS RANDY QUAN. FATHER OF MURDER VICTIM MONICA QUAN. THE DOUBLE HOMICIDE, THE EQUIPMENT FOUND IN THE DUMPSTER, THE LAPD -- SHE'S CONNECTED IT ALL. SHE SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOT TO CALL AND TELL THEM, 'HEY, YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THIS GUY.'" IF EVANS IS RIGHT, THERE COULD BE A COP-TURNED-COP-KILLER ON THE STREET, HEAVILY ARMED AND HOT ON REVENGE. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT IN HOLLYWOOD. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT YOU SEE ON TV. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE EVEN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE THAT THAT INVESTIGATION WAS GONNA HAVE TENTACLES BACK TO LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. POLICE MUST FIND CHRISTOPHER DORNER, STARTING WITH ONE PLACE THEY KNOW HE WAS -- THE DUMPSTER IN NATIONAL CITY. COULD ANYONE HAVE SEEN HIM THERE? WEDNESDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 6th, WE SENT OUR DETECTIVES DOWN TO NATIONAL CITY. WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW THE PROPERTY ENDED UP IN THAT DUMPSTER. POLICE GO TO THE CAR-STEREO STORE EAGER TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY SURVEILLANCE ON THE DUMPSTERS. OUR DETECTIVES STARTED CANVASSING THE AREA AND FOUND VIDEO... FROM A FIXED, COLOR CAMERA ON A WALL OVERLOOKING THE ALLEYWAY. BUT ARE THEY TOO LATE? MANY TAPES GET RECORDED OVER AFTER 24 HOURS. IT'S ALREADY BEEN TWO DAYS SINCE THE ITEMS WERE DUMPED. WE SECURED THAT VIDEO AND WERE ABLE TO REVIEW THAT. THEY'RE IN LUCK. THE FOOTAGE FROM TWO DAYS EARLIER IS INTACT. IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH. THEY REWIND TO THE MORNING THE ITEMS WERE FOUND, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 4th, AT 9 A.M. THE ALLEYWAY IS EMPTY. THEN, A VEHICLE PULLS UP NEXT TO THE DUMPSTER. IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE INVESTIGATORS SAW NEAR THE CRIME SCENE IN IRVINE. THERE WAS A LARGE PICKUP TRUCK PARKED IN THE ALLEY. A FIGURE EMERGES FROM THE TRUCK AND MAKES SEVERAL TRIPS TO THE DUMPSTER. SEE THAT? THE TRUCK LEAVES. WITHOUT A GOOD LOOK AT THE DRIVER... IT LOOKS LIKE INVESTIGATORS HAVE LOST THEIR LEAD. BUT JUST MOMENTS LATER, HE'S BACK. THERE -- CAN YOU GET HIS LICENSE PLATE? AND THIS TIME, HE'S CLEARLY VISIBLE. BLACK MALE THROWING THESE ITEMS INTO THE DUMPSTERS. HE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE FIRED LAPD OFFICER CHRISTOPHER DORNER. POLICE WATCH AS HE SLOWLY DISPOSES OF MORE ITEMS IN A DUMPSTER CLOSER TO THE CAMERA. HE WAS REMARKABLY CALM AND NONCHALANT. HE WAS VERY METHODICAL. HE'S IN NO HURRY AT ALL. THERE. MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING CAUGHT WOULD GRAB A HANDFUL OF STUFF, THROW IT IN THE DUMPSTER. YOU'RE GONE -- IN THE CAR, SPEED OFF. IT'S A FULL VIEW OF A SUSPECTED KILLER PRESUMABLY DUMPING EVIDENCE IN A SECOND DUMPSTER POLICE HAVEN'T SEARCHED. DETECTIVE HERNANDEZ RACES TO INVESTIGATE AND FINDS SOMETHING SHOCKING. THERE WAS A FULLY-LOADED GLOCK PISTOL MAGAZINE. THE HEADSTAMP MATCHED THE SHELL CASINGS AT OUR CRIME SCENE. THE MAN IN THE VIDEO IS ALMOST CERTAINLY EX-LAPD OFFICER CHRISTOPHER DORNER, NOW THE PRIME SUSPECT IN THE DOUBLE MURDER. THIS IS THE REAL THING. THIS IS RELATED. THIS IS OUR SUSPECT. YOU'RE SURE IT'S HIM, AND YOU CAN SAY CONCLUSIVELY THAT HE WAS AT THAT LOCATION AT THAT TIME. INCREDIBLY USEFUL FOR US BECAUSE WE COULD THEN KNOW WITH CERTAINTY WHEN HE WAS THERE, WHEN HE DUMPED THE PROPERTY AND START CREATING A TIMELINE. TO FIND HIM, POLICE MUST QUICKLY LEARN EVERYTHING THEY CAN ABOUT CHRISTOPHER DORNER. WHEN THE INFORMATION FROM NATIONAL CITY STARTED TO FILTER ITS WAY BACK TO OUR PERSONNEL BACK AT THE STATION, THEY BEGAN TO LOOK INTO THIS NAME. THEY TRAWL EVERY POSSIBLE DATABASE TO FIND OUT MORE. ARE THERE ANY CONNECTIONS? ARE THESE THINGS RELATED? AND WHAT THEY FIND WILL SHOCK THE ENTIRE LAW-ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. DURING SOME ROUTINE SEARCHES OF DATABASES, THIS POSTING APPEARED ON A SOCIAL-MEDIA SITE. AN 11,000 WORD MANIFESTO FULL OF TERRIFYING LANGUAGE. I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO LOOK AT IT. IT WAS KIND OF SURREAL. WE ALL KIND OF STARTING YELLING, "DO YOU SEE THIS?" WE BEGAN TO READ IT, AND BEFORE THEY EVEN GOT TO THE END OF IT, WE'RE STARTING TO GET THE SENSE THAT THIS IS THE REAL THING. YOU COULD HEAR PEOPLE YELLING OVER THE TOP OF THEIR CUBICLES, "YOU CALL THIS PERSON. YOU CALL THAT PERSON." DORNER PRACTICALLY BOASTS ABOUT WHAT HE'S DONE. HE WAS CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DOUBLE HOMICIDE. AND HE SAYS HE'S JUST GETTING STARTED. DORNER NAMES AT LEAST 40 OTHER TARGETS... MANY OF THEM WITHIN THE LAPD. IT'S A DECLARATION OF WAR. IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO JUSTICE THE SPEED AND THE CONTROLLED CHAOS THAT WAS GOING ON. VERY QUICKLY, WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION, YEAH, THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE AT RISK. TO SEE NAMES OF PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH, PEOPLE YOU KNOW THAT ARE REAL PEOPLE, KNOWING JUST EXACTLY HOW MUCH WEIGHT THIS MANIFESTO HAS, IT WAS QUITE CHILLING. IRVINE P.D. CALLS THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT AND SAYS, "HEY WE FOUND A DOCUMENT ONLINE "THAT THIS GUY WROTE THAT SAYS HE'S COMING AFTER "A BUNCH OF LOS ANGELES POLICE OFFICERS, AND THAT THEIR FAMILIES ARE FAIR GAME." THE TARGETS ARE SCATTERED ALL OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE START SCRAMBLING TO PUT UP PROTECTION DETAILS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR FOLKS ARE TAKEN CARE OF. I KNOW PEOPLE WERE PULLING DOWN FACEBOOK POSTINGS. PEOPLE WERE SHUTTING DOWN ACCOUNTS. ALL OF A SUDDEN, PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "HOLY SMOKES. "I GOT TO TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY. I GOT TO MAKE SURE MY KIDS ARE OKAY." ONE OF THE KEY TARGETS IS THE VERY WOMAN WHO CONNECTED THE MURDERS, SERGEANT TERESA EVANS. WE GOT HER INTO A SAFE LOCATION AND HAD A PROTECTION DETAIL WITH HER AROUND THE CLOCK. ALL OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, POLICE DEPARTMENTS SWING INTO ACTION ON THE MANHUNT. AND THE MORE THEY LEARN ABOUT DORNER, THE MORE TERRIFIED THEY BECOME. THERE WAS INFORMATION THAT HE HAD SOME LEVEL OF A MILITARY BACKGROUND WHICH THEN REVEALS THAT HE'S HIGHLY TRAINED, IN A TACTICAL SENSE, BEYOND LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE'VE NEVER HAD A ROGUE OFFICER WHO'S DISGRACED GO OFF AND GO ON A KILLING SPREE AND SPECIFICALLY TARGET LAW-ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THEIR FAMILY -- NEVER. NOR HAVE POLICE FACED A CRIMINAL AS WELL ARMED AS DORNER, WHO'S VOWED TO USE HIS FIREPOWER. TO CATCH HIM IN PERSON, THEY'LL HAVE TO CATCH HIM ON CAMERA. HE'S ON A MISSION. AND HE'S ON A ROAD THAT HE KNOWS HE CAN'T BACK OFF FROM. IT'S BEEN ALMOST 72 HOURS SINCE THE DOUBLE MURDERS IN IRVINE, CALIFORNIA. AND INVESTIGATORS ARE ON THE TRAIL OF CONFESSED KILLER CHRISTOPHER DORNER. THEY FOUND HIS VIOLENT MANIFESTO AND CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF HIM ON SECURITY CAMERAS, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND HIM. WE WERE LOOKING FOR ANYTHING THAT WAS EITHER RELATED TO OUR HOMICIDE OR WOULD GIVE US AN INDICATION OF WHERE HE MIGHT BE AT. WE STARTED TO LOOK AT, "WHERE WAS HE? WHEN WAS THIS POSTED? HOW WAS IT POSTED?" WE LEARNED THAT THE MANIFESTO HAD BEEN POSTED USING THE Wi-Fi AT A MOTEL IN MANHATTAN BEACH. POLICE RUSH TO THE MOTEL TO FOLLOW UP. HI. CAN I HELP YOU? CAN I SEE YOUR GUEST REGISTRATION? THE SUSPECT HAS COVERED HIS TRACKS USING A FALSE NAME AND PAYING IN CASH. BUT THERE ARE EYES ALL OVER THE MOTEL. AND THE SECRETS THEY HOLD WILL TERRIFY POLICE. WE WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT, JUST AFTER 9:00 P.M. ON SUNDAY, SUPER BOWL SUNDAY, HE CHECKED INTO THE MOTEL. JUST MINUTES AFTER OUR FIRST OFFICERS WERE GOING ON SCENE OF OUR DOUBLE HOMICIDE, HE WAS CHECKING INTO THE MOTEL. THE CAMERA CATCHES HIM CLEAR AS DAY. IT IS CHRISTOPHER DORNER. I SAW SURVEILLANCE OF HIM. IT REALLY HITS HOME WHEN YOU SEE HIM. AND HE LOOKS UP AT THE CAMERA, AND YOU TOTALLY INSTANTLY RECOGNIZE HIS FACE. AND HE SEEMS TO BE A MAN ON A MISSION. WE KNEW THAT HE HAD A NUMBER OF GUNS REGISTERED TO HIM -- AT LEAST 25 OR SO GUNS. AND THE CAMERA OUTSIDE THE MOTEL SHOWS HIM LOADING THIS ARSENAL INTO HIS TRUCK. HIS MANIFESTO HAS PROMISED A RAMPAGE. 25 GUNS IS A LOT. IT CERTAINLY GAVE US PAUSE. BUT WHAT ARE POLICE TO DO NOW? THEY'RE ALREADY TWO DAYS BEHIND A KILLER HELL-BENT ON REVENGE. HE'S CAPABLE OF GOING OUT AND KILLING AN INNOCENT, BEAUTIFUL, YOUNG WOMAN FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN THAT HER DAD DEFENDED HIM AT A BOARD OF RIGHTS. THEN, WHAT ELSE IS THIS GUY CAPABLE OF? WHO ELSE IS THIS GUY CAPABLE OF COMING AFTER? CHRISTOPHER DORNER IS ON THE LOOSE WITH A TRUCK FULL OF WEAPONS AND AN UNSATISFIED VENDETTA. HE HAS PROMISED TO KILL AGAIN. IT'S A RACE AGAINST TIME TO FIND DORNER BEFORE HE KEEPS HIS WORD. WE DO EXPECT THAT THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD THAT A MURDER SUSPECT WILL FLEE SOUTHBOUND TOWARDS THE BORDER OF MEXICO ABSOLUTELY EACH AND EVERY TIME. WE EXPECT THAT, WE ANTICIPATE THAT, AND WE PREPARE FOR THAT. INVESTIGATORS GET THEIR FIRST LEAD THAT DORNER'S HEADING SOUTH. WE FOUND DORNER'S IDENTIFICATION. THAT WAS THE FIRST ABSOLUTE, FACTUAL INFORMATION THAT CHRISTOPHER DORNER WAS IN SAN DIEGO. IS DORNER HEADING FOR THE BORDER AFTER ALL, OR IS HE JUST LAYING A TRAP? IT DIDN'T MAKE TOO MUCH SENSE THAT HE WOULD DISCARD HIS IDENTIFICATION. IS THIS HIS ATTEMPT TO LURE US IN, TO LEAVE TRAILS FOR US? AND, SURE ENOUGH, JUST AS LAW ENFORCEMENT IS LOOKING SOUTH, A NEW LEAD COMES IN FROM CORONA, CALIFORNIA, NEARLY 100 MILES TO THE NORTH. THERE WERE TWO OFFICERS THAT WERE HEADED OUT TO A PROTECTION DETAIL. THE OFFICERS SEE DORNER AND GIVE CHASE. HE WAS WAITING FOR THEM, LYING IN WAIT WITH HIS RIFLE PREPARED. THE POLICE HAVE DRIVEN RIGHT INTO AN AMBUSH. IT WAS A FLURRY OF ROUNDS. 29 BULLETS HIT THE CAR, ONE GRAZING AN OFFICER'S HEAD. IT'S A MIRACLE THAT NEITHER OF THEM WERE KILLED. YET AGAIN, DORNER GETS AWAY. 10 MILES FROM CORONA, IN THE SLEEPY TOWN OF RIVERSIDE... OFFICER CRAIN WORKING PATROL WITH HIS PARTNER IN RIVERSIDE, THEY'RE CROSSING OVER THE INTERSECTION JUST AS DORNER'S COMING THE OPPOSITE WAY. THE DASH CAM CAPTURES DORNER IN THE ACT. IT GIVES CRUCIAL INSIGHT INTO THIS COLD-BLOODED KILLER. HE IMMEDIATELY STARTED SHOOTING AT THEIR CAR. Officer shot multiple times! STRUCK THE CAR MULTIPLE TIMES AND TRAGICALLY KILLED OFFICER MICHAEL CRAIN. IT ONLY TAKES MINUTES BEFORE POLICE ARE AT THE SCENE, BUT IT'S TOO LATE. OFFICER CRAIN IS WEARING A BADGE IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. HIS PARTNER IS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED, AND DORNER IS GONE AGAIN. IT WASN'T JUST THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT OR THE RIVERSIDE POLICE DEPARTMENTS. IT WAS OUR FAMILY. IT WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WAS UNDER ATTACK. AND SO IT WAS PERSONAL AND ENORMOUS. THREE ARE DEAD, ONE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED. EVERYONE WITH A BADGE IS A TARGET. EVERY OFFICER IS IN JEOPARDY. HOW DOES LAW ENFORCEMENT PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THIS GUY? HOW DO WE EFFECTIVELY LOCATE HIM AND TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY WITHOUT ANOTHER MURDER, WITHOUT ANOTHER PERSON DYING? HOW DO WE DO THAT, AND HOW QUICKLY CAN WE PUT THAT PLAN TOGETHER? THEN, FINALLY, A LEAD -- A REPORT OF A BURNING BLACK TRUCK IN THE SMALL MOUNTAIN RESORT TOWN OF BIG BEAR. BUT CORNERED, THIS MONSTER WILL BE AT HIS MOST DANGEROUS. POLICE, HUNTING SPREE-KILLER CHRISTOPHER DORNER, HAVE GOTTEN REPORTS OF A TRUCK MATCHING THE SUSPECT'S BURNED AND ABANDONED IN THE MOUNTAINS. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE DORNER HAD GONE FROM THAT TRUCK. IF IT IS HIS, WHY? WHY IS HE HERE? THERE IS A SENSE OF FEAR. A SEARCH OF THE VEHICLE CONFIRMS IT'S DORNER'S. IN THE BURNED NISSAN, WE LOCATED REMNANTS OF AN AR-15 RIFLE AND BARREL, A GLOCK 9mm HANDGUN, AND CAMPING AND SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT. WE ALL BELIEVED, IN A SENSE, THAT DORNER WAS SHAKEN UP, AND THE NET WAS CLOSING IN ON HIM. WE WERE ABOUT TO CAPTURE HIM. BUT DORNER'S GONE. IF HE'S ON FOOT, HE COULD VANISH INTO THE MOUNTAINS WITH HIS REMAINING ARSENAL AND LIE IN WAIT. THE STRESS LEVEL DEFINITELY ROSE BECAUSE ALL OF THE THOUGHTS THAT WERE INITIALLY GOING THROUGH OUR MINDS AS INVESTIGATORS WERE NOW BECOMING A REALITY. THE FOCUS WAS A MANHUNT, AND THE PROBLEM WAS WHERE TO LOOK. I MEAN, WE HAD NO CLUE. SEARCH TEAMS HEAD INTO THE MOUNTAINS. THEY CHECK CABINS AND USE INFRARED SCANNERS TO DETECT BODY HEAT, BUT THE TRAIL HAS GONE ICE COLD. IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING FOR US. WE HAD THE BEST OF THE BEST OUT THERE POUNDING THE GROUND, LOOKING FOR HIM, AND HE JUST WASN'T SURFACING. WE WERE STILL A COUPLE OF STEPS BEHIND HIM. NO ONE KNOWS WHERE HE'S HIDING. FEBRUARY 12th, FIVE DAYS SINCE DORNER WAS LAST SEEN, JIM AND KAREN REYNOLDS ARRIVE AT THEIR REMOTE MOUNTAIN CABIN AND QUICKLY DISCOVER THEY'RE NOT ALONE. - GET THEM UP! - AS THEY WALKED IN, THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY CONFRONTED BY DORNER, WHO HAD A SEMIAUTOMATIC HANDGUN. HER AND HER HUSBAND WERE TIED UP AND GAGGED. DORNER'S ONLY INTERESTED IN KILLING POLICE, BUT HE NEEDS A VEHICLE. DORNER HAD TAKEN THEIR NISSAN ROGUE AND LEFT THE LOCATION WITH IT. THE HOSTAGES CALL THE POLICE, WHO NOW KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING FOR DORNER IN A NISSAN TRUCK. ALL THE ROADS IN AND OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN ARE BLOCKED. THAT'S WHEN THE STRESS LEVEL WENT UP. LIKE, "WOW. OKAY. "NOW, WE REALLY GOT SOMETHING GOING ON. THIS IS GONNA BE SOMETHING." YOU KNOW, YOUR ADRENALINE STARTS GOING. IT'S NOT SWAT TEAMS, IT'S THE BIG BEAR GAME WARDENS WHO SPOT THE FUGITIVE FIRST. I GO, "HEY, HEY, THAT'S OUR VEHICLE." IT SET IN SHOCK LIKE, "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?" AND HE'S JUST FLYING DOWN THE ROAD. SO THE DEPUTIES SCREAM, "LET'S GO! LET'S GO! LET'S GO!" WE START FLYING DOWN THE ROAD. DOZENS OF OTHER SQUADS JOIN IN PURSUIT... COMING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS TOWARDS DORNER'S STOLEN VEHICLE. NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS VEHICLE SPEEDING DOWN OUR DIRECTION. I LOOKED AT THE DRIVER, AND WE SAID, "THAT'S **** HIM." SURROUNDED, DORNER FLEES THE VEHICLE AND SLIPS INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD OF MOUNTAIN CABINS. TWO OFFICERS FOLLOW ON FOOT. ONE OF THOSE OFFICERS IS DETECTIVE JEREMIAH MacKAY AND DEPUTY ALEX COLLINS. THEY BEGIN SEARCHING FOR FOOTPRINTS... ...WHEN SHOTS RING OUT FROM ONE OF THE NEARBY CABINS. DEPUTY ALEX COLLINS WAS THE FIRST TO BE STRUCK BY GUNFIRE. THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO REACT. Officer down, officer down. Copy -- Officer down. ALEX HAD BEEN SHOT IN THE CHEST. HE HAD BEEN SHOT IN THE ARM -- THE LEFT ARM. HE HAD BEEN SHOT IN THE LEG, AND HE HAD TAKEN ONE BULLET DIRECTLY THROUGH THE FRONT OF HIS FACE. DORNER IS EMPTYING HIS ARSENAL WHILE DETECTIVE COLLINS LIES ON THE GROUND OUTSIDE THE CABIN, CLINGING TO LIFE. HIS PARTNER, DETECTIVE MacKAY RETURNS FIRE AND IS FATALLY SHOT BY DORNER. DORNER'S DEADLY RAMPAGE HAS NOW KILLED FOUR AND SERIOUSLY WOUNDED TWO MORE. BUT HE'S FINALLY SURROUNDED. THE OFFICERS CONTINUED TO DEPLOY GAS. THEY CONTINUED TO GIVE PUBLIC-ADDRESS ANNOUNCEMENTS. THIS IS DORNER'S LAST STAND. POLICE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BURN HIM OUT. AT ONE POINT DURING THE OPERATION, THE CABIN CAUGHT ON FIRE. Burner is deployed, and we have a fire. OFFICERS ARE BRACED OUTSIDE, WAITING FOR DORNER TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE. BUT DORNER'S SAVED ONE BULLET FOR THIS MOMENT. A SHORT TIME AFTER THE CABIN FIRE STARTED, THE OFFICERS ON SCENE COULD HEAR WHAT THEY BELIEVE WAS A SINGLE, DISTINCT GUNSHOT. Sounded like one shot fired from inside the residence. FLAMES ENGULF THE CABIN AS EVERYONE REALIZES THE MANHUNT IS OVER. THE SINGLE, DISTINCT GUNSHOT WAS ACTUALLY THE SHOT THAT ENDED DORNER'S LIFE. HE DECIDED TO COMMIT SUICIDE. AFTER 10 DAYS AND 4 MURDERS, DORNER IS DEAD. HIS TARGET WAS ANYONE WITH A BADGE. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK HIM DOWN. THE AMOUNT OF ADMIRATION I HAVE FOR MY FELLOW DEPUTIES IS BEYOND ANY WORDS THAT ANYBODY COULD EVER USE OR EXPLAIN. THEY ARE SOME OF THE MOST COURAGEOUS MEN THAT I PROBABLY WILL EVER HAVE THE PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH AND NEXT TO. THERE ARE TWO MIRACLES. AFTER 20 SURGERIES, DETECTIVE ALEX COLLINS RETURNS TO ACTIVE DUTY. THE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED OFFICER IN RIVERSIDE SURVIVES EIGHT BULLETS. EVERYBODY, I THINK, TAKES A BIG BREATH OF RELIEF THAT HIS REIGN OF TERROR, HIS DELUSIONAL MURDER RAMPAGE WAS OVER. BUT IN HIS WAKE, POLICE HAVE A LOT OF GRIEVING TO DO. IT KILLS YOU AS WELL. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S A LOSS. PEOPLE'S LIVES WERE RIPPED APART HERE. THERE WAS NO HAPPY ENDING. FOUR INNOCENT VICTIMS -- MONICA QUAN, OFFICER KEITH LAWRENCE STARTING A NEW LIFE TOGETHER. OFFICER MICHAEL CRAIN AND DEPUTY SHERIFF JEREMIAH MacKAY LEAVE BEHIND WIVES AND YOUNG CHILDREN. NOT ONLY WERE THEY TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILY, BUT THEIR FUTURE IS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM. IT'S JUST REALLY SOMETHING THAT WILL -- I KNOW IT WILL ALWAYS STAY WITH ME. I'M CERTAIN IT WILL STAY WITH ANY MEMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS INVESTIGATION. A FEW SNIPPETS OF ORDINARY-LOOKING VIDEO IN THE HANDS OF SKILLED INVESTIGATORS WERE ABLE TO HELP TRACK DORNER AND STOP HIM BEFORE HIS RAMPAGE GOT EVEN MORE DEADLY. THE OVERWHELMING FEELING IS A SENSE OF PRIDE THAT WE MOBILIZED SO QUICKLY TO SUPPORT THE INVESTIGATION. WE'RE PROUD OF EACH OTHER. ALTHOUGH THERE'S NO SENSE OF SATISFACTION IN THE WAY THAT THIS ENDED, YOU KNOW, WHAT I AM LEFT WITH IS AN OVERWHELMING SENSE OF PRIDE TO BE PART OF THIS GREATER LAW-ENFORCEMENT FAMILY. MEANWHILE, THE CAMERAS KEEP WATCHING.
