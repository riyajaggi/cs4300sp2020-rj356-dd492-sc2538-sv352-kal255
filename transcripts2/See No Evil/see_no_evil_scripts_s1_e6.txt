 16-YEAR-OLD SKYLAR NEESE ARRIVES HOME, BEAT AFTER FINISHING A LATE SHIFT AT A LOCAL DINER. SHE CAME IN AND SHE SAID, "I THINK I'M GOING TO BED, MOM. I'M TIRED." AND SHE GAVE ME A KISS ON THE CHEEK. AND I SAID, "WELL, WE LOVE YOU, HONEY." YOU KNOW, "GOOD NIGHT." THE NEXT DAY, SKYLAR'S DAD, DAVE NEESE, GETS HOME FROM HIS NIGHT SHIFT TO LEND HIS DAUGHTER THE CAR. I CAME HOME FROM BREAK, AND, I KNOCKED ON HER DOOR. SKYLAR? COME ON, WAKE UP. AND I SAID, "SKYLAR, HONEY." I SAID, "IT'S DADDY." I SAID, "YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO, GET READY AND TAKE ME BACK TO WORK IF YOU WANT THE CAR." AND I DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER.

 SKYLAR, WAKE UP. THE DOOR WAS LOCKED. SKYLAR, COME ON. I GOT A COAT HANGER AND POPPED OPEN THE DOOR. SKYLAR, WE GOT TO GO. COME ON. SKYLAR. BUT SKYLAR'S BEDROOM IS EMPTY. SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT. SKYLAR? HER BED HADN'T BEEN SLEPT IN. SO I STARTED GETTING REALLY WORRIED. I CALLED MARY AT WORK AND SAID, "DO YOU KNOW WHERE SKYLAR IS?" AND SHE SAID, "NO." HER BED IS STILL MADE. BUT MARY'S NOT AS CONCERNED. NO. I-I DON'T KNOW. I SAID, "JUST CALM DOWN. WE'LL FIND HER." SHE WAS ALWAYS AT HER FRIEND'S HOUSE OR BIRTHDAY PARTIES GALORE. SO I TOLD DAVE, "CALL SOME OF HER FRIENDS. "SEE IF SHE'S WITH 'EM. MAYBE THEY WENT SHOPPING OR SWIMMING." SKYLAR'S BEST FRIEND IS SHELIA EDDY. I ASKED SHELIA, "HAVE YOU SEEN SKYLAR?" SHE SAID, "NO." NO. I SAID, "WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU TALKED TO HER?" SHE SAID, "MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT." I SAID, "WOW." I SAID, "OKAY." I SAID, "I'M GETTING KIND OF WORRIED. I CAN'T FIND HER ANYWHERE." A HIGH ACHIEVER AND LOVING DAUGHTER, SKYLAR'S THEIR PRIDE AND JOY. SKYLAR WAS SPOILED ROTTEN. ME AND SKYLAR USED TO HAVE ONE DAY WHERE MOM HAD TO WORK AND I DIDN'T, AND WE CALLED IT SKYLAR-DADDY DAY, AND WE COULD DO WHATEVER SHE WANTED. AS THEIR ONLY CHILD, SKYLAR IS DEVOTED TO HER PARENTS. A LOT OF KIDS BLOW THEIR PARENTS OFF. YOU KNOW, "I-I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR MOM NOW OR DAD NOW." SKYLAR NEVER DID THAT. SHE TOLD US EVERY DAY SHE LOVED US. SO THEN I WENT OUT ON THE PORCH TO HAVE A CIGARETTE, AND I LOOKED DOWN OVER THE PORCH AND I NOTICED THIS LITTLE BLACK BENCH. IT WAS A LITTLE MAKEUP BENCH. AND I SAID, "THAT'S SKYLAR'S." THEN I SAW HER WINDOW HAD BEEN OPEN. THE SCREEN WAS OUT OF THE WINDOW. AND I SAID, "NO. SHE SNUCK OUT LAST NIGHT." THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME SKYLAR'S REBELLED. THE CURFEW IS 11:00 IN STAR CITY. WE TRY AND PREVENT ANYONE GOING TO PARTIES OR UNDERAGE DRINKING TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS FROM HAPPENING. FOR THAT REASON, TEENAGERS SNEAK OUT SOMETIMES. NO BIG DEAL FOR SKYLAR AND HER OLD FRIEND MORGAN. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DO IT THAT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, "I WANTED TO GO ON A RIDE WITH MY FRIEND AT MIDNIGHT, AND MOM'S NOT GONNA SAY, 'YES' TO THAT." WHEN SHE HEARS THE NEWS, MARY'S NOT PANICKED. SHE HEADS HOME TO REASSURE DAVE AND DEVISE A PLAN. SHE LIKED GOING TO WORK, EVEN IF SHE WAS SICK. SO I TOLD DAVE, SHE'S DUE AT WORK AT 4:00. IF SHE DOESN'T SHOW UP, WE'LL GIVE HER TILL 4:00. SIX HOURS PASS WITHOUT A WORD. THEY CAN ONLY PRAY SKYLAR'S ABOUT TO SHOW UP AT HER JOB. WELL, ABOUT 10 MINUTES BEFORE WE CALLED THE FAST-FOOD PLACE TO ASK 'EM IF SKYLAR WAS THERE, THEY CALLED US. AND SAID, "IS SKYLAR COMING TO WORK TODAY?" AND AT THAT POINT, I KNEW SOMETHING WAS BAD WRONG. I CALLED 9-1-1. I SAID, "MY 16-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER'S MISSING. "WE CAN'T FIND HER ANYWHERE. I NEED SOME HELP." STAR CITY POLICE JUMP ON THE CALL, EVEN THOUGH A VAST MAJORITY OF MISSING TEENS ARE FALSE ALARMS. IF THEY LEAVE ON A FRIDAY, THEY'RE USUALLY HOME BY MONDAY. THEY JUST WANT TO GO HAVE FUN OVER THE WEEKEND WHEN THEIR PARENTS WON'T LET 'EM, AND THEN THEY COME HOME. BUT IN THIS SMALL TOWN, POLICE ARE HAPPY TO HELP WORRIED PARENTS. THEY START LOOKING AROUND SKYLAR'S BEDROOM. THE VERY FIRST THING SPOTTED WAS HER CELL=PHONE CHARGER. WELL, TEENAGERS, YOU GOT TO HAVE YOUR CHARGER. YOU GOT TO HAVE YOUR PHONE. HER CONTACTS WERE STILL THERE, HER TOOTHBRUSH, NO CHANGE OF CLOTHES. NOTHING WAS MISSING. IF SHE HAD RUN AWAY, SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOMETHING. POLICE SEE IT ALL THE TIME, BUT SKYLAR'S PARENTS KNOW THAT THIS IS ANYTHING BUT EVERYDAY. FEARING THE WORST, THEY LOOK TO NEIGHBORS FOR HELP. WE WENT BLOCK BY BLOCK, YOU KNOW, HOUSE BY HOUSE DOWN THE BLOCKS AND KNOCKED ON DOORS, "HAD ANYONE SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING?" NOTHING CAME UP. STAR CITY'S A VERY SMALL TOWN, VERY SMALL. AND IT'S A VERY SLEEPY TOWN IS WHAT I LIKE TO CALL IT. THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT THAT GOES ON THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT. SO IT -- IT WAS DIFFICULT WHENEVER EVERYONE'S LIKE, "I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING AT ALL." THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME EXPLANATION. SOMEONE MUST KNOW SOMETHING. AND RIGHT ON CUE... HELLO? SKYLAR? IT'S SKYLAR'S BEST FRIEND SHELIA. SHE SAID, "MARY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH." I SAID, "THE TRUTH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE TRUTH?" SHE SAID, "SKYLAR AND RACHEL AND I SNUCK OUT LAST NIGHT." IT BACKS UP WHAT THEY ALREADY SUSPECTED. I SAID, "WELL, WHERE IS SKYLAR? WHERE DID YOU LEAVE HER AT?" MY INITIAL THOUGHT WAS THEY HAD TAKEN HER SOMEWHERE, SHE SPENT THE NIGHT WITH ONE OF HER FRIENDS. THEN SHE WENT ON TO SAY WHEN THEY CAME HOME, SKYLAR DEMANDED THAT SHE STOP AT THE END OF THE BLOCK, LET HER OUT OF THE CAR, AND SHE WOULD WALK TO THE HOUSE, BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT US KNOWING THAT SHE HAD SNUCK OUT. SHE DIDN'T WANT US HEARING HER COME IN. SHELIA SAYS SHE DROPPED OFF SKYLAR SOMETIME AROUND 11:45 P.M. AND NONE OF THE FRIENDS HAS SEEN HER IN THE 18 HOURS SINCE. MY FEAR WAS IF SHELIA HAD LET HER OUT AT THE END OF THE BLOCK, WHO SNATCHED HER UP BETWEEN POINT "A" AND POINT "B"? I WAS A MESS. MARY WAS A MESS. WE HAD A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL MISSING. NOBODY BUT NOBODY KNEW WHERE SHE WAS. I WAS SURE SHE HAD BEEN ABDUCTED. I WAS TERRIFIED. IT'S EVERY PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE. SHELIA NOW COMES TO THE NEESE HOME ANXIOUS TO HELP IN ANY WAY SHE CAN. SO I SAID, "SHELIA, ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE SKYLAR'S AT?" SHE SAID, "I'M POSITIVE." WELL, THE STAR CITY POLICE OFFICER ADDED, "YOUNG LADY, IF YOU'RE LYING, YOU'RE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE." AND SHE SAID, "I'M NOT LYING." WE SAID, "OKAY." JUST AS PANIC'S ABOUT TO SET IN, SKYLAR'S MOM CHANNELS HER INNER SLEUTH. I REMEMBERED WE HAVE SECURITY CAMERAS. SO I TOLD DAVE, I SAID, "WELL, LET'S CALL THE LANDLORD. LET'S CHECK THE SECURITY CAMERAS." IF LUCK'S ON THEIR SIDE, SKYLAR'S LAST KNOWN WHEREABOUTS COULD BE ETCHED ON VIDEOTAPE. IN THE SMALL WEST VIRGINIA TOWN OF STAR CITY, TEENAGER SKYLAR NEESE HAS GONE MISSING. BUT BY A STROKE OF LUCK, NEIGHBORHOOD SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN IT ALL ON TAPE. THE PARKING-LOT CAMERA RUNS 24/7. IT'S THEIR BEST HOPE. WE WATCHED THE VIDEO FOOTAGE. WE WATCHED AND WATCHED AND WATCHED. AND IT WAS IN NORMAL RUN TIME, SO IT TOOK FOREVER. JUST AS DAVE, MARY, AND SKYLAR'S FRIEND SHELIA ARE BEGINNING TO LOSE HOPE, AT AROUND 12:30... ...A CAR PULLS UP OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT BUILDING. IT WAS VERY BLURRY. IT WAS DARK. IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT, AND THEY PARKED BEHIND THE BUILDING. SO IT WAS ALL IN SHADOW. DAVE SAID, "WELL IS THAT YOU? IS THAT WHERE YOU GUYS PICKED HER UP AT?" SHELIA SAID, "NO." THEY HAD PICKED HER UP CLOSER TO OUR PARKING AREA BY THE MAILBOXES. SHE SAID THEY HAD PICKED HER UP AROUND 11:00, AND THEY WENT FOR THEIR DRIVE. THEY WENT FOR A JOYRIDE JUST TO HANG OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT, SMOKE A LITTLE MARIJUANA, AND THEN THEY ALL WENT HOME. SO THE VIDEO SHOWS SOMETHING NO ONE EXPECTED. 45 MINUTES LATER AT 12:30, A CAR APPEARS OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT BUILDING. THEN... THAT'S HER. THAT'S HER. THAT'S SKYLAR. WE SAW SKYLAR'S HEAD BOB UP. AGAIN, SHE JUST KIND OF LIKE APPEARED IN THE SHOT. SHE WALKED OUT TO THE CAR AND GOT IN. I WAS KIND OF RELIEVED TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS LEAVING WITH A FRIEND OF HERS OR SOMETHING. DETECTIVE JESSICA COLEBANK STUDIES THE SURVEILLANCE, DISSECTING EVERY TINY DETAIL. YOU SEE A-A SEDAN PULL DOWN THE ROAD INTO THEIR, BASICALLY, DRIVEWAY BETWEEN THE TWO APARTMENT BUILDINGS. AND YOU SEE SKYLAR KIND OF RUNNING ACROSS THE PARKING LOT TO THE VEHICLE. SHE GOT IN THE BACKSEAT OF THE VEHICLE... ...AND THEY LEFT. BUT INVESTIGATORS' FIRST REAL LEAD ISN'T JUST SKYLAR. IT'S HER BEHAVIOR. SHE WAS PRACTICALLY RUNNING TO THIS CAR, SO WE KNEW IT WAS SOMEONE THAT SHE KNEW. THIS IS NO ABDUCTION. HAS SKYLAR NEESE RUN AWAY WITH SOMEONE SHE KNOWS? IT'S ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY BECAUSE SOMETHING'S GOING ON AT HOME LIFE, OR THEY HAVE A SECRET BOYFRIEND, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 24 HOURS SINCE SKYLAR WAS LAST SIGHTED, AND EVEN WITH THEIR BIG PIECE OF EVIDENCE, POLICE ARE STALLED. IF ONLY THE IMAGES WEREN'T SO BLURRY. THE ONLY THING WE KNOW, IT'S A LIGHT-COLORED 4- DOOR SEDAN. WE COULDN'T GET A CLEAR VIEW OF THE LICENSE PLATE. WE COULDN'T TELL THE MAKE, MODEL, COLOR EVEN. THE ONLY FACT THAT WE COULD PROVE AT THE TIME WAS THAT SHE WILLINGLY GOT IN THAT VEHICLE. THAT WAS THE LAST KNOWN EVENT THAT CAN BE DOCUMENTED. SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO GO OFF OF. AS 24 HOURS TURNS INTO 48, NO FURTHER LEADS EMERGE. WE'RE FRANTIC EVERY DAY THAT PASSES IS ANOTHER DAY THAT WE HAVEN'T FOUND HER, THAT OUR BABY'S MISSING, AND WE'RE MAD. WE'RE UPSET. WE'RE TIRED. IT'S JUST -- IT WAS HORRIBLE. IT WAS PURE HELL. WE JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. IT APPEARED EVERYTHING HAD STOPPED. THE LOCAL POLICE SAW HER GETTING INTO THE CAR WILLINGLY. THAT WAS IT. SHE WAS A RUNAWAY. WELL, WE JUST FELT THEY WERE DOING NOTHING. AND THAT WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME TO NOT HAVE ANY ANSWERS FOR ANY QUESTION THEY HAD OTHER THAN "SKYLAR'S STILL MISSING. I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE'S AT." DESPERATE FOR CLUES, DAVE AND MARY CONTINUE REACHING OUT TO THEIR COMMUNITY. I CREATED MY OWN WEB PAGE CALLED "TEAM SKYLAR." I WANTED SUPPORT. I WANTED THE LOCAL MEDIA TO GET THE NEWS OUT. I WANTED HER PICTURE IN THE PAPER EVERY DAY. I WANTED SKYLAR'S FACE TO BE NOTICED. WE COULDN'T KEEP ENOUGH FLYERS OF SKYLAR'S PICTURES. PEOPLE WERE DISTRIBUTING THEM ALL AROUND TOWN. SKYLAR'S MISSING. HAS ANYONE HEARD FROM HER? ANYONE KNOW WHERE SHE MIGHT BE? AND IT JUST -- IT WENT CRAZY. I REMEMBER SEEING THINGS ABOUT HER MISSING AND GETTING TEXT MESSAGES FROM PEOPLE. I REMEMBER THE FIRST PROBABLY, LIKE, THREE OR FOUR DAYS, I JUST -- THAT WAS ALL I COULD REALLY THINK ABOUT. TO STAVE OFF CONSTANT DOUBT, SHELIA STEPS UP AS AN EMOTIONAL ROCK FOR HER BEST FRIEND'S PARENTS. SHELIA WAS THERE AT OUR HOUSE JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY. AND SHE WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE. SHE TOLD US THAT, "IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. SHE'LL -- SHE'LL BE BACK. I KNOW SHE WILL." SHELIA AND SKYLAR CALLED THEMSELVES BEST FRIENDS FROM THE TIME THEY WERE 8 YEARS OLD TILL SHE WAS 16. THEY WOULD LAUGH AND GIGGLE 24/7 ON THE PHONE IF WE WOULD LET THEM. YEAH, THEY SEEMED TO LOVE SPENDING TIME TOGETHER. FRESHMAN YEAR, A NEW GIRL IN TOWN, RACHEL, JOINS THE SKYLAR-SHELIA DUO AND THE THREE BECOME INSEPARABLE. IT REALLY WASN'T UNTIL RACHEL AND SHELIA THAT YOU SORT OF SAW THINGS START TO CHANGE. THEY BECAME JOINED AT THE HIP ALMOST. I MEAN, IT WAS NO LONGER SKYLAR. IT WAS SKYLAR, RACHEL, AND SHELIA. HEY. HEY, GUYS. WHAT'S UP? WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO? I MEAN, THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT THE OTHER TWO. WE'RE GONNA SKIP FOURTH. REALLY? AND YOU'RE GONNA SKIP WITH US. I WOULD LOVE TO. TOGETHER THE TRIO CULTIVATES A ROWDY REPUTATION. THERE WAS ALWAYS DRINKING AND PARTYING AND THAT KIND OF STUFF GOING ON. IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS EVER A, "WE WENT TO THE MOVIES," LIKE A NORMAL FRESHMAN. BUT NOW RACHEL, TOO, ISN'T AROUND. SHE'S MILES AWAY AT CHURCH CAMP SOUTH OF TOWN. AND AS THE DAYS PASS WITH STILL NO SIGN OF SKYLAR, SHELIA BEGINS FALLING APART AT THE SEAMS. SHELIA AT ONE POINT CAME TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE SAID, "CAN I GO BACK AND SIT IN SKYLAR'S ROOM FOR A MINUTE?" SO SHE WENT BACK THERE, AND SHE WAS GONE FOR A LONG TIME. SOMETHING'S WRONG. SHE'S VERY UPSET. SO I WENT IN. I SAID, "ARE YOU OKAY?" AND SHE SAID, "I DON'T SEE WHY SHE COULD HAVE LEFT ME. I DON'T SEE WHY SHE DID THIS." FOUR DAYS SINCE SKYLAR VANISHED. MEANTIME, DAVE AND MARY'S MEDIA BLITZ KICKS INTO HIGH GEAR. THE LOCAL NEWS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS A TEEN MISSING. FACEBOOK IS LIKE WILDFIRE. IT SPREAD INTERNATIONALLY. THE STAR CITY POLICE HAD CALLED AND SAID, "HEY, WE GOT A SIGHTING IN NORTH CAROLINA "WHERE THE WOMAN IS POSITIVE IT'S SKYLAR. SHE'S WITH A RED-HAIRED GIRL." ALL THE HARD WORK MIGHT FINALLY BE PAYING OFF. IF SKYLAR'S BEEN SEEN WITH A RED-HAIRED GIRL, IT COULD BE RACHEL. AT THE TIME, RACHEL WAS AT CHURCH CAMP, SO IT WAS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY THAT RACHEL SKIPPED CHURCH CAMP TO RUN OFF TO THE BEACH WITH SKYLAR JUST TO GET AWAY. GO, GO, GO, GO. WE WERE SURE IT WAS HER. NO, THEY WERE SURE IT WAS HER. IT'S THE NEWS THE FAMILY HAS BEEN PRAYING FOR. WE -- WE JUST KNEW WE WERE GONNA BRING HER HOME. IN A SMALL WEST VIRGINIA TOWN, POLICE HUNT FOR 16-YEAR-OLD RUNAWAY SKYLAR NEESE, LAST SEEN ON SECURITY CAMERA GETTING WILLINGLY INTO A CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. ALL THEIR LEADS GO NOWHERE... UNTIL NOW. OKAY, THANK YOU. SKYLAR AND HER FRIEND RACHEL MAY HAVE BEEN SIGHTED 600 MILES AWAY IN NORTH CAROLINA. DAVE AND I, SOON AS WE HEARD IT, WE WERE -- WE WERE LEAVING. WE WERE HEADED TO BRING HER HOME. THAT WAS THE BEST NEWS WE HAD HAD FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE REASON WAS BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY RAN OFF AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO STAY. JUST AS THE ANXIOUS PARENTS ARE ABOUT TO HIT THE ROAD, DETECTIVE COLEBANK GETS A CALL FROM DISPATCH. Officer Colebank, you got a code 1-4-9. That's a negative. Repeat, that's a negative. I SAT IN MY CAR FOR A MINUTE. IT WAS HARD. IT WASN'T SKYLAR. IT WASN'T RACHEL. THEY WERE TWO RUNAWAYS, BUT IT WASN'T THEM. SO THAT WAS LIKE A, YOU KNOW, KICKED US IN THE HEART REALLY HARD BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IF THAT WASN'T HER THEN SHE'S STILL MISSING. SHE'S STILL OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. THE SEARCH FOR SKYLAR NEESE IS BACK TO SQUARE ONE. THAT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO GO HOME TO MY FAMILY AND KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMEONE MISSING OUT THERE AND THEIR FAMILY MISSES THEM. AND IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO FIND HER, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. TWO MONTHS SINCE SKYLAR WAS LAST SEEN. SKYLAR'S DISAPPEARANCE GENERATES A FLOOD OF SMALL-TOWN GOSSIP AND SPECULATION. AS COPS FOLLOW UP ON EVERY STORY, SKYLAR'S GOOD GIRL REPUTATION STARTS TAKING HITS. THERE WERE RUMORS THAT SKYLAR HAD A SECRET BOYFRIEND THAT HER PARENTS DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE HE WAS A LOT OF TROUBLE. HE WAS A TROUBLEMAKER. IF THIS RUMOR'S TRUE, TRACKING DOWN THE BOYFRIEND COULD LEAD THEM STRAIGHT TO SKYLAR, BUT POLICE NEED A NAME. SKYLAR'S CLASSMATES HELP DETECTIVES DRAW UP A LIST OF HER CLOSE MALE FRIENDS. AND TWO NAMES KEEP POPPING UP -- 20-YEAR-OLD DYLAN CONAWAY AND HIS OLDER BROTHER DEREK, WHO LIVE IN NEARBY BLACKSVILLE. SCHOOLMATES REPORT THAT SKYLAR AND RACHEL LIKE TO PARTY WITH THEM. THE TWO BROTHERS HAD A BIT OF A SKETCHY PAST AND WERE KNOWN TO THROW PARTIES AND HAVE UNDERAGE GIRLS THERE, WHICH SHELIA, RACHEL, AND SKYLAR HAD ATTENDED. TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE CONAWAYS, DETECTIVE COLEBANK GETS THE STATE POLICE ON BOARD. I JUST MENTIONED THE NAME AND THEY'RE LIKE, "FUNNY YOU BRING THAT UP." THEY'RE PEOPLE OF INTEREST IN A CASE WE'RE WORKING. AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT SKYLAR VANISHED, A BANK IN BLACKSVILLE, WEST VIRGINIA, IS ROBBED, AND THE CRIME IS CAUGHT BY SURVEILLANCE. THE MALE SUBJECT HAD ENTERED THE BANK, CARRYING A FIREARM. THEY OBTAINED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF CASH AND THEN THEY FLED ON FOOT. THE VIDEO HELPS COPS BUILD A PROFILE OF THE PERPETRATOR. THEIR PRIME SUSPECTS -- THE CONAWAY BROTHERS. WHAT IF SKYLAR'S INVOLVED WITH A COUPLE OF BANK ROBBERS? MYSELF AND TROOPER BERRY DROVE UP TO THE RESIDENCE TO DO WHAT WE CALL A KNOCK AND TALK. ONCE WE PULLED INTO THE CONAWAY'S RESIDENCE, WE SAW DEREK CONAWAY IN THE BACKYARD...DIGGING HOLES. SO I JUST JOKINGLY SAID, "YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? TRYING TO BURY A BODY?" AND THE EXPRESSION THAT DEREK GAVE US WAS DEER IN THE HEADLIGHT, "I JUST SAW A GHOST" LOOK. UM, VERY ODD. VERY WEIRD. WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO THEY HUNG OUT WITH. WHO WERE THEY DATING? WHO WERE THEY CHEATING ON? BEYOND THAT, POLICE HAVE NOTHING ON THEM. BUT NOW THERE'S A LINK TO SKYLAR'S CASE. OFFICER JESSICA COLEBANK FROM STAR CITY POLICE TOLD US, "THIS GUY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT FOR THE BANK ROBBERY "COULD VERY WELL POSSIBLY BE INVOLVED IN SKYLAR NEESE'S DISAPPEARANCE." I REMEMBER RONNIE CALLING ME AND SAYING, "DID YOU REMEMBER HEARING ABOUT THAT SKYLAR NEESE GIRL? WELL, THE GIRLS THAT SHE'S FRIENDS WITH KNOW THE CONAWAYS." SHELIA EDDY AND DYLAN CONAWAY, THE YOUNGER BROTHER, ACTUALLY DATED. WE THEN STARTED FINDING PICTURES OF SHELIA, SKYLAR, AND DYLAN CONAWAY TOGETHER. SOCIAL-NETWORKING SITES OFFER A PEEK INTO THE CONAWAY'S LIVES. WE FOUND OUT THE BROTHERS WERE INTO A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF DRUGS. THEY WANT TO GIVE THE FEMALES HARD-CORE DRUGS, YOU KNOW, TO GET 'EM LOOSENED UP. POLICE SPECULATE SKYLAR COULD BE ONE OF THOSE FEMALES HANGING WITH THIS SHADY CROWD. SO WE SHIFTED FROM BANK ROBBERY TO, "OKAY. LET'S FIND SKYLAR, BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE A CONNECTION NOW." THEN DETECTIVES CATCH A BREAK. THEY HEAR A NEW PIECE OF GOSSIP THAT COULD EXPLAIN WHY SKYLAR SNUCK OUT THE NIGHT OF JULY 5th. WE WERE GETTING ANONYMOUS TIPS, CALLS IN THE OFFICE. PEOPLE WERE TELLING US, "HEY, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A PARTY IN BLACKSVILLE. THERE WAS PILLS. THERE WAS HEROIN, MARIJUANA." AND ALLEGEDLY SKYLAR NEESE WAS AT ONE OF THESE PARTIES ON THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED. SO WE THOUGHT, "OKAY, MAYBE ONE OF THESE GUYS OUT IN BLACKSVILLE "WERE THE ONES THAT PICKED HER UP "AFTER SHELIA HAD DROPPED HER OFF, AND THEY DROVE HER TO THIS PARTY." YOU GOOD? BUT EVEN IF SKYLAR DID SHOW UP AT THE PARTY, NO ONE IS TALKING. SOMEBODY'S EVENTUALLY GONNA CALL US AND TELL US, "HEY, I WAS AT THIS PARTY. THIS IS WHAT I SAW." BUT AS TIME WENT ON, NOBODY CALLED US. WE JUST COULD NOT FIGURE OUT, "WHY IS NOBODY COMING FORWARD? WHY IS NOBODY TELLING US WHERE SKYLAR'S AT AND WHAT HAPPENED?" POLICE PAY SKYLAR'S FRIEND RACHEL A VISIT. SHE'S JUST RETURNED FROM CHURCH CAMP, BUT SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT. RACHEL WAS VERY NERVOUS. I KNEW SHE KNEW SOMETHING. SOMETHING HAPPENED AT THIS PARTY, AND SOMEONE ELSE DID SOMETHING TO SKYLAR. THEY KNOW SOMETHING. IT'S JUST THEY'RE TOO AFRAID TO TELL US. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN REMEMBER FROM THAT NIGHT? ANYTHING SHE SAID, ANYONE SHE TALKED TO MAYBE? NO. RACHEL DENIES EVER DRIVING TO BLACKSVILLE OR GOING TO PARTY WITH SKYLAR ON THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED. WHAT TIME DID YOU DROP HER OFF? 11:30? 11:30, YOU SURE? YEAH. OKAY. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO SKYLAR'S FRIENDS WERE, WHO SHE WAS HANGING OUT WITH, AND NOBODY CAN TELL ME WHO THIS CAR IS? TO ME, IT WAS BULL. WHY CAN'T NOBODY TELL US WHO OWNS THIS VEHICLE? TO FIND THE CAR, POLICE TRACE THE DRIVING ROUTE FROM STAR CITY TO BLACKSVILLE. IF SKYLAR DID GO TO THIS PARTY, SHE MOST LIKELY CAME THIS WAY. ALONG THE ROUTE ARE DOZENS OF SHOPS AND GAS STATIONS. POLICE FOCUS ON A NEW STORE, MAYBE THE UPGRADE ALSO CAME WITH SECURITY CAMERAS? SHEETZ WAS A NEWLY-CONSTRUCTED CONVENIENCE STORE. IT HADN'T BEEN THERE VERY LONG. LET'S JUST GO DOWN THERE, TAKE A PEEK AND SEE WHAT WE GET. MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO PICK UP SOMETHING OF THIS CAR TO GET A GENERAL IDEA, "OKAY. WHICH DIRECTION, YOU KNOW, DID THE CAR GO?" WE TALKED TO THE STORE MANAGER. IT'S A HIT. THE STORE HAS CAMERAS INSTALLED, AND THE MANAGER HAS READY ACCESS TO THE FOOTAGE THE NIGHT OF THE SKYLAR'S DISAPPEARANCE. I'M SCROLLING THROUGH THE FOOTAGE. I SEE THAT CAR GO PAST THE SHEETZ AT 12:30. A FOUR-DOOR SEDAN, SILVER IN COLOR, AND AT 12:39, EXACT SAME CAR GOES PAST THE SHEETZ CAMERA. AND I SAID, "CHRIS, LOOK AT THIS." HEY, BERRY. I WENT, "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?" I LOOKED AT RYAN, I SAID, "I'LL BE DAMNED. THAT WAS IT." THAT'S THE CAR. NEW SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM A CONVENIENCE STORE IN STAR CITY, WEST VIRGINIA, PROVIDES A BREAKTHROUGH IN THE HUNT FOR MISSING SCHOOLGIRL SKYLAR NEESE. STAR CITY POLICE DETECTIVES SPOT A CAR MATCHING THE ONE SEEN AT THE NEESES' APARTMENT AT 12:30 ON JULY 6th, THE NIGHT SKYLAR DISAPPEARED. LOOK WHICH WAY IT'S GOING. I SAID, "YEAH. IT'S -- IT'S GOING TOWARDS THE APARTMENTS." JUST NINE MINUTES LATER, THE EXACT SAME CAR DRIVES PAST THE SHEETZ CONVENIENCE-STORE CAMERA IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, TOWARDS BLACKSVILLE. THE SHAPE AND COLOR MATCH THE ONE THAT PICKED SKYLAR UP. COULD THIS BE THE CAR? DETECTIVES CROSS-REFERENCE THE TIME THE CAR IS FIRST SEEN WITH THE TIME THAT SKYLAR SNUCK OUT. HE SAYS, "LOOK WHAT TIME IT IS." IT WAS FIVE MINUTES OR LESS BEFORE THE CAR PULLED IN THE APARTMENT. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THE TIMES THAT WE HAD MATCHED UP, THE CAR GOES RIGHT BY. THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE ONE. THE EVIDENCE BACKS UP WHAT DETECTIVES ALREADY THOUGHT -- SKYLAR MUST HAVE SNUCK OUT TO GO TO A PARTY. THE VIDEO ALSO GIVES THEM MORE IMAGES OF THE MYSTERY VEHICLE. IT'S DEFINITELY MORE CLEAR IN THE SHEETZ VIDEO. STILL COULDN'T GET A LICENSE PLATE, SO WE STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT WAS, BUT WE HAD A BETTER DESCRIPTION OF THE VEHICLE. DETECTIVES MUST CATCH UP WITH THIS CAR OR THE CASE GOES COLD. THEY MINE EVERY FRAME OF THE SURVEILLANCE LOOKING FOR MORE CLUES. IT COULD BE A MAZDA. IT COULD BE A MITSUBISHI. IT COULD BE A HONDA. THERE'S MILLIONS OF CARS THAT ALL LOOK THE SAME. IT'S HARD TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN EACH VEHICLE, SO IT WAS SO MANY ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES. LET'S NOT COUNT THAT ONE OUT -- HANG ON, STOP, STOP. PAUSE THAT. I WAS OBSESSED WITH IT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, TO ME, THIS WAS, THE BAD GUYS WERE WINNING. WE GOT INTO AN UNMARKED VEHICLE. WE DROVE OUT IN BLACKSVILLE AT MIDNIGHT. WE WENT TO EVERY BACK ROAD YOU COULD FIGURE. PULL UP TO DRIVEWAYS REAL QUICK, LOOK AT THE VEHICLE. IF WE FOUND A VEHICLE WE THOUGHT MATCHED, WE'D TAKE A QUICK PICTURE OF IT AND BACK OUT. GET THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER. FIGURE OUT WHO THEY WERE, UM, WHO WAS DRIVING THAT VEHICLE? WHO OWNED THE VEHICLE? THEY'LL TAKE THE SHOTS BACK TO H.Q. AND RUN EACH PLATE, LOOKING FOR SOME LINK. MEANWHILE, AS THE LAST PEOPLE TO HAVE SEEN SKYLAR, SHELIA AND RACHEL ARE PRESSED BY DETECTIVE COLEBANK FOR EVERY DETAIL OF THEIR LATE-NIGHT JOYRIDE. BOTH DENY THEY WENT TO ANY PARTY IN BLACKSVILLE THE NIGHT OF THE DISAPPEARANCE. BOTH SAY THE CAR IN THE VIDEO ISN'T THEIRS. THE DETECTIVE WILL TAKE EACH OUT IN HER CRUISER, RETRACING THEIR JOURNEY STEP BY STEP, STARTING WITH SHELIA. LET'S GO FOR A RIDE. JUST SHOW ME WHERE YOU WENT. THAT WAY I HAVE A-A BETTER IDEA OF WHERE TO LOOK HERE. SO SHE GOT IN THE CAR AND WE DROVE AROUND ON THE SIDE STREETS. AND SHE WAS SURE THIS IS THE ROUTE THAT THEY TOOK. IT'S TIME TO COMPARE SHELIA'S STORY TO SKYLAR'S OTHER BEST FRIEND. SURELY RACHEL'S STORY WILL MATCH. WE INTERVIEWED RACHEL AFTER THAT, AND HER PORTION OF THAT STORY WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. WHERE DID YOU GUYS GO THAT NIGHT? RACHEL'S STORY, SAID THEY WENT THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THEY WENT THE MAIN THOROUGH THROUGH STAR CITY. IT WAS EXCITING AND -- AND MIND-BOGGLING. IT -- LIKE, "OKAY. WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE? YOU JUST GAVE ME SOMETHING. NOW I NEED TO USE IT." DETECTIVE COLEBANK REMINDS RACHEL THAT HER STORY HAS WITNESSES SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE CONSIDERED. WELL, THERE'S PLENTY OF BUSINESSES WHERE YOU SAID YOU WENT. THEY ALL HAVE CAMERAS... SO WE'LL SEE YOU DRIVING BY. YOU COULD SEE THE PANIC IN RACHEL'S FACE. SHE HAD A GHOST LOOK ON HER FACE. HER EYES WERE BIG. IT WAS KIND OF A BLANK STARE, LIKE, "GOD. WHAT DO I DO NOW? WHAT DO I SAY?" HER RESPONSE WAS, "WELL, I WAS REALLY HIGH, SO MAYBE NOT," BECAUSE THEY HAD SMOKED MARIJUANA. THAT'S IT. YOU'RE TELLING ME THE TRUTH. YEAH. YOU'RE SURE? IF THE GIRLS ARE WITNESSES, ONE THING'S FOR SURE -- BEST CASE, THEY'RE UNRELIABLE. UP TO NOW, SHELIA HAS BEEN THE FAMILY'S BIGGEST HELP, AND POLICE HAVE TAKEN HER AT HER WORD, TRUSTING HER VERSION OF WHEN AND WHERE SHE DROPPED SKYLAR OFF. NOW, EVERYTHING SHELIA'S TOLD THEM MUST BE VERIFIED. DETECTIVES REVISIT THE SECURITY VIDEO AT THE NEESES' APARTMENT TO SEE IF SHELIA'S CAR ARRIVES WHEN SHE SAID. THEY WATCH THE VIDEO FROM THE VERY FIRST FRAME TO THE LAST. WE HAD FOUR HOURS OF IT. I DON'T CARE IF I GOT TO SIT THERE THE WHOLE TIME. I NEVER SAW SHELIA'S CAR COME. WATCHING IT FROM THAT VIDEO FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END, EARLIER THAT EVENING WHERE SHELIA SAID THAT SHE PICKED UP SKYLAR AND WHERE AT AND HOW. NEVER DID HAPPEN. THE TIME WAS COMPLETELY OFF FROM WHAT SHE SAID. THE WAY THE CAMERAS ARE ANGLED, YOU CAN SEE ANY CAR THAT GOES DOWN THAT STREET. THEY MAY NOT STOP IN CAMERA VIEW, BUT YOU CAN SEE CARS WHEN THEY DRIVE THROUGH. SO YOU SEE HEADLIGHTS. THERE WERE NO HEADLIGHTS. IT APPEARS SKYLAR'S FRIENDS NEVER PICKED HER UP OR DROPPED HER OFF, AT LEAST NOT WHEN THEY SAY THEY DID. IN FACT, THE SURVEILLANCE SHOWS SKYLAR LEFT HER APARTMENT ONLY ONCE AT 12:30, AND NEVER CAME BACK. SOMEBODY'S LYING TO THE POLICE ABOUT THE TIMELINE OF THAT NIGHT. COULD THE GIRLS ALSO BE LYING WHEN THEY SWEAR THE CAR IN THE VIDEO ISN'T THEIRS? AFTER ALL, SHELIA OWNS A CAR THAT CAN'T BE RULED OUT. SHELIA OWNS AND DRIVES A 2006 TOYOTA CAMRY, AND IT'S SILVER IN COLOR. THE COLORS MATCH. IT'S FOUR-DOOR. THE TIMEFRAME'S GOOD. MY GOD. IT'S IN THAT GENERAL AREA OF WHERE SKYLAR LIVES, SO WE WERE CONFIDENT THAT WAS SHELIA'S CAR. BUT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SIMILAR CARS IN THE AREA. SHELIA STICKS TO HER STORY. THE CAR IN THE VIDEO ISN'T HERS. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO ARREST ANYBODY. SHELIA AND RACHEL ARE SKYLAR'S BEST FRIENDS. ONLY HARD EVIDENCE CAN MAKE THEM SUSPECTS NOW. COPS RUN SHELIA AND RACHEL'S CELL PHONE RECORDS. WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO LEARN WILL BLOW THE LID OFF THE CASE. THAT'S WHEN WE DISCOVERED RACHEL AND SHELIA'S CELL PHONES WERE VERY ACTIVE AFTER 4:00 IN THE MORNING ON JULY 6, 2012 IN BLACKSVILLE, WEST VIRGINIA. BUT RACHEL HAD DENIED BEING IN BLACKSVILLE THAT NIGHT, ANOTHER LIE. ONCE WE HAD ALL THE VIDEO EVIDENCE AND THE CELL-PHONE RECORDS, THAT'S WHEN THEIR STORIES STARTED TO CRUMBLE. AND IN ONE OF HER INTERVIEWS, SHELIA FINALLY ADMITTED THAT IT WAS HER CAR IN THE VIDEO. POLICE HAVE SPENT THE LAST TWO MONTHS HUNTING DOWN A MYSTERY VEHICLE. IT TURNS OUT THE OWNER WAS RIGHT UNDER THEIR NOSE ALL ALONG. POLICE HAVE THE TEENS CORNERED, AND IT'S TIME TO NAIL THEM DOWN ABOUT WHERE THEY ACTUALLY WENT THAT NIGHT. RACHEL TOLD US, "WE WENT OUT TO BLACKSVILLE. "WE SMOKED POT. "SKYLAR WANTED TO GO TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE SO THEY COULD GET MORE MARIJUANA." HER AND SHELIA DID NOT WANT TO GO, SO THEY AGREED TO DROP SKYLAR OFF AT THE FRIEND'S HOUSE. SOMEONE LETS HER IN THE HOUSE, AND THEY LEAVE. WHEN WE FINISHED THE INTERVIEW WITH RACHEL, WE IMMEDIATELY INTERVIEWED SHELIA. SHE ADMITS, "WE WENT OUT TO BLACKSVILLE. "WE SMOKED POT, AND SKYLAR GETS MAD AT US BECAUSE WE WON'T GO TO "A FRIEND'S HOUSE TO BUY MARIJUANA AND SHE LEAVES AND WE CAN'T FIND HER." ONCE AGAIN, THE GIRL'S STORIES DON'T MATCH. THE VERY NEXT DAY, SHELIA DISCOVERS RACHEL TOLD US THAT THEY DROPPED SKYLAR OFF AT HER FRIEND'S HOUSE, AND SHELIA KNEW THAT SHE HAD TOLD US SOMETHING DIFFERENT. NOW THEIR STORIES ARE MATCHING UP. "OKAY, WE DID DROP HER OFF AT THE FRIEND'S HOUSE IN BLACKSVILLE." HEY. HEY, HOW'S IT GOING? GOOD, HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. COME ON IN. THEY ARE LYING THROUGH THEIR TEETH. AS POLICE RATCHET UP THE PRESSURE ON SHELIA AND RACHEL, AT SCHOOL, WORD SPREADS LIKE WILDFIRE THAT THE GIRLS ARE HOLDING BACK INFORMATION ABOUT SKYLAR'S WHEREABOUTS. SO YOU SEE THEM, YOU KNOW, CRYING AND COMFORTING EACH OTHER. AND, YOU KNOW, IT KIND OF... IT RAISES A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION. IT GOT TO RACHEL FIRST. SHE GOT MORE AGGRESSIVE TOWARDS HER FRIENDS, MEAN TOWARDS FAMILY. AND ONE DAY, IN DECEMBER 2012, SHE FINALLY SNAPS. RACHEL'S MOTHER CALLS THE POLICE, CONCERNED ABOUT HER DAUGHTER'S BEHAVIOR. SHE'S ADMITTED INTO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. SIX DAYS LATER, SHE'S DISCHARGED AND VOLUNTARILY GOES TO THE POLICE. SHE HAD SOMETHING TO TELL US. AND I'M EXPECTING HER TO TELL ME THAT, "THERE WAS A PARTY THAT NIGHT. "SKYLAR OVERDOSED. WE PANICKED AND WE HELPED DISPOSE OF HER BODY." THAT'S WHAT I WAS EXPECTING RACHEL TO TELL ME. BUT INVESTIGATORS ARE NOT PREPARED FOR THE STORY THEY ARE ABOUT TO HEAR. IT'S FAR MORE TWISTED THAN THEY HAVE EVER IMAGINED. FIVE MONTHS SINCE SKYLAR NEESE DISAPPEARED, SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE HELPS POLICE LEARN HER BEST FRIENDS ARE HIDING SOMETHING. BUT WHAT POLICE ARE ABOUT TO HEAR LEAVES THEM COMPLETELY AGHAST. FIRST WORDS OUT OF HER MOUTH WERE... WE STABBED HER. "WE STABBED HER." WE WERE SPEECHLESS AT THAT POINT. THAT'S SOMETHING WE WERE NOT EXPECTING TO HEAR, THAT HER AND SHELIA STABBED SKYLAR TO DEATH. "WELL, LET'S START OVER AGAIN, OKAY. LET'S START OVER, AND TELL US EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED." JULY 5, 2012, SHELIA HAD PICKED UP RACHEL, DROVE TO RACHEL'S FATHER'S HOUSE. SHE GETS A SHOVEL, PUTS IT IN THE TRUNK. THE GIRLS BROUGHT A CHANGE OF CLOTHES, CLEAN CLOTHES THAT THEY KEPT IN THE TRUNK. SHE ALSO BROUGHT SOME CLEANING SUPPLIES. SHELIA BRINGS THE KNIVES. RACHEL CALLS SKYLAR, THAT 12:15 PHONE CALL, "HEY, WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO PICK YOU UP. BE WAITING FOR US." THEY PICKED UP SKYLAR. COME ON, COME ON. GO, GO, GO. DROVE OUT TO GREENE COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA. PULLED THE CAR OVER IN A RURAL, QUIET AREA. THEY ALL THREE GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND WERE WALKING AWAY FROM THE CAR, AND SKYLAR WAS ON HER WAY BACK TO THE CAR TO GET, LIKE, A LIGHTER. DO YOU HAVE A LIGHTER? NO. AT THE AGREED UPON MOMENT, RACHEL SAID, "I COUNTED TO THREE." ON THREE. ONE, TWO... THREE. AND AT ONE POINT, SKYLAR LOOKED UP AND ASKED THEM, "WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WHY?" WHY? WHY? SKYLAR GOT THE KNIFE FROM RACHEL AT ONE POINT, AND STABBED RACHEL IN THE LEG WITH IT. AT THAT POINT, RACHEL SAID SHE DISCONTINUED THE ATTACK, BUT SHELIA KEPT GOING. AND SHELIA SAID, AFTER 50 STABS, SHE QUIT COUNTING. WHEN SHE WAS DEAD, THEY TRIED TO BURY A GRAVE. THEY COULD NOT CREATE A GRAVE BIG ENOUGH 'CAUSE OF THE ROCKS, AND THE EARTH WAS TOO HARD. SO THEY DRUG HER BODY APPROXIMATELY 44 FEET OR SO FROM THE ROADWAY EDGE. THEY COVERED IT UP WITH BRANCHES AND DIRT, LEAVES, AND THEN THEY CHANGED OUT OF THEIR BLOODY CLOTHES, PUT THE BAGS IN THE TRUNK OF THE CAR, ALONG WITH THE KNIVES... ...AND THEY BOTH GOT IN THE VEHICLE AND LEFT HER THERE. SKYLAR'S BODY LIES UNDISCOVERED FOR SIX MONTHS, UNTIL IT IS FINALLY FOUND ON JANUARY 16, 2013. WHY WOULD TWO 16-YEAR-OLD GIRLS JUST PLAN OUT A SINISTER, METICULOUS, PREMEDITATED MURDER OF THEIR BEST FRIEND? WHAT ARE YOU DEALING WITH? I HAD ASKED HER, "WHY DID YOU AND SHELIA KILL SKYLAR?" AND RACHEL'S ONLY ANSWER WAS, "WE DIDN'T LIKE HER." DIDN'T LIKE HER. THAT'S ALL. IT LEAVES ROOM ONLY FOR MORE RUMORS, THAT SKYLAR'S BEST FRIENDS WERE DAMAGED BY DRUGS, THAT THEY WERE SECRETLY LOVERS, OR THEY WERE JUST PLAIN EVIL. THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE I DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER KNOW WHY THEY DID IT. THERE'S ONLY TWO PEOPLE THAT WILL BE ABLE TO TELL US, AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO KNOW IF THEY'RE GONNA TELL US THE TRUTH OR NOT? THEY'VE LIED SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION ON THIS. IT WAS A THRILL KILL, TO ME. WE KNEW, AT THAT POINT, THAT SHE WAS INDEED GONE AND WASN'T COMING HOME. YOU KNOW, THAT WAS A FACT. IT WAS JUST SO DEVASTATING AND HARD TO BELIEVE. YOU KNOW, HOW COULD HER TWO BEST FRIENDS DO THAT TO HER AND GO ALL THAT TIME SWEARING THEY HAD NO IDEA. WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET OVER IT. WE JUST GOT TO GET STRONGER. WE GOT TO GET TOUGHER. SHELIA EDDY IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. RACHEL SHOAF'S CONFESSION REDUCES HER SENTENCE TO 30 YEARS. BUT THE KILLERS HAVE NEVER ELABORATED ON THEIR MOTIVE. FOR SKYLAR'S PARENTS, THEIR DAUGHTER'S LAST WORD, "WHY?" IS NEVER ANSWERED. TWO FLEETING GLIMPSES OF A CAR WERE ENOUGH FOR POLICE TO CRACK THE CASE. WITHOUT THOSE VIDEO SURVEILLANCES, WE -- WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD NOTHING TO GO OFF OF OTHER THAN JUST STATEMENTS. EVERYBODY SEES THESE SWEET, INNOCENT GIRLS. ONE'S A RISING ACTRESS. THE OTHER ONE IS A PRETTY GIRL THAT CAN GET ANY GUY SHE WANTED. AND TO SEE THAT SIDE OF THEM, THE PURE EVIL SIDE OF THEM, PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT. BUT IT'S THERE. IT TRULY IS THERE WITH THESE GIRLS. GET IN, GET IN, GET IN. COME ON. BUT IT'S A CASE THAT WILL ALWAYS BE IN THE BACK OF MY MIND. IT WILL NEVER GO AWAY. I WANT TO SEE. SECURITY FOOTAGE DIDN'T JUST HELP SOLVE THE CASE OF SKYLAR NEESE. IT GAVE HER GRIEVING PARENTS A FINAL GLIMPSE OF THE DAUGHTER THEY LOVED. MEANWHILE, THE CAMERAS KEEP WATCHING.
