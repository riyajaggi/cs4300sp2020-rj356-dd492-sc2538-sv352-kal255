 IT WAS PROBABLY THE HARDEST TIME OF THEIR LIVES. BOTH CASES CONFOUND THE POLICE UNTIL ONE UNWAVERING WITNESS TELLS ALL. EARLY EVENING IN PEMBROKE PINES, FLORIDA... ...A WOMAN HAS VANISHED. THE FRANTIC CALLER IS NATALIE'S SISTER, MICHAELA. I KNOW MICHAELA AND HER WERE VERY, VERY CLOSE. THEY SPOKE EVERY DAY. NATALIE IS A HARDWORKING REAL ESTATE AGENT AND LOVING SINGLE MOM TO 17-YEAR-OLD AIDEN AND 21-YEAR-OLD GERARD WHOM SHE ADOPTED AS A CHILD. SHE HAD A VERY CLOSE-KNIT FAMILY. THIS MORNING, AIDEN AND GERARD WOKE TO FIND THEIR MOTHER GONE.

 BY EVENING, SHE STILL HASN'T RETURNED. SO THEY CALL MICHAELA. MICHAELA KNEW HER SISTER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HER SISTER WASN'T GONNA LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH -- WITHOUT HER PHONE, OR HER KEYS, OR HER PURSE, OR ANY OF HER PERSONAL BELONGINGS. DETECTIVE WAYNE KATZ FROM THE PEMBROKE PINES POLICE DEPARTMENT HEADS TO THE BELMONTE HOME TO INVESTIGATE. WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT NATALIE'S FRIENDS, HER COMINGS AND GOINGS, WHERE SHE WOULD GO, WHO SHE WOULD GO SEE. GERRY EXPLAINS THAT THE NIGHT BEFORE, HE AND HIS MOM WENT TO A FRIEND'S GRADUATION PARTY. LET'S GO. AND AS ALWAYS, NATALIE REALLY SEEMED TO ENJOY HERSELF. SHE HAD A SMILE THAT WAS WELCOMING. HER SMILE WOULD LIGHT UP A ROOM. ANYONE THAT MET HER HAD SOMETHING POSITIVE TO SAY ABOUT HER. IT'S NEARLY 3 A.M. WHEN SHE DRIVES THEM HOME. HE WENT TO BED, AND -- AND SHE WENT TO BED, AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT, HE HAD SEEN HIS MOTHER. AS DETECTIVE KATZ KNOWS, MOST MISSING ADULTS WILL SHOW UP ON THEIR OWN. USUALLY THE PERSON, IS SHORTLY THEREAFTER LOCATED AND THERE WAS MAYBE SOME MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN FAMILY MEMBERS. BUT MICHAELA HAS A SISTERLY SENSE THAT SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG. THERE WAS SOME THINGS THAT RAISED HER SUSPICIONS THAT SOMETHING JUST DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT. NOW, YOU NEED TO SEE THIS. STARTING WITH NATALIE'S CAR. THE WAY THE SEAT WAS POSITIONED, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE. COULD BE SHE REPOSITIONED TO GET OUT MORE EASILY, OR SOMEONE ELSE WAS DRIVING HER CAR. DETECTIVE KATZ IS LOOKING FOR SOME LOGICAL EXPLANATION. WE WILL CALL OUR LOCAL HOSPITALS. WE'LL CONTACT, UM, CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES, JAILS, TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD BEEN ARRESTED. THERE'S NO SIGN OF NATALIE ANYWHERE. NEXT, KATZ QUESTIONS THE HOST OF THE PARTY WHO CONFIRMS THAT NATALIE SEEMED AS HAPPY AS CAN BE. IT'S ANOTHER DEAD END. KATZ ASKED GERRY FOR ANY MORE INFORMATION ON THE HOURS LEADING TO HIS MOTHER'S DISAPPEARANCE. AND HE GOES ON TO DESCRIBE A COUPLE OF ERRANDS THEY RAN ON THE WAY TO THE PARTY. HE, RECALLED THAT THEY HAD GONE TO A WALGREENS AND A HESS GAS STATION, MADE SOME MINOR PURCHASES. IS IT POSSIBLE THE TROUBLE STARTED THAT EARLY IN THE EVENING? IF THESE BUSINESSES HAVE SECURITY CAMERAS, THEY MIGHT HAVE CAPTURED SOMETHING OR SOMEONE SUSPICIOUS. AND THERE'S NO ONE WHO CAN FIND GRAINY CLUES BETTER THAN DETECTIVE STEVE WETTERER, AN EXPERT IN SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE ANALYSIS. EVEN IF IT LOOKS ROUTINE, NOTHING GETS PAST WETTERER. YOU HAVE TO BE VIGILANT. THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT, THE SLIGHTEST SOMETHING, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STOP THE VIDEO, REWIND IN CASE YOU MISS SOMETHING. IF THERE ARE ANY SECRETS LURKING ON THE TAPES, DETECTIVE WETTERER WILL SPOT THEM. THE MANAGER OF BOTH OF THE WALGREENS AND OF THE HESS STATION WERE ABLE TO JUST BURN ME COPIES OF THE VIDEO. AT 7:09 P.M., WETTERER FINDS JUST WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR -- A GLIMPSE OF THE MISSING MOTHER AND HER SON. I WAS ABLE TO GET FOOTAGE OF BOTH OF THEM WALKING IN, BOTH OF THEM INSIDE THE STORES. THERE'S NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. NO UNUSUAL ACTIVITY. NOTHING STRANGE OR SUSPICIOUS. AND NATALIE LOOKS RELAXED. THE VIDEOS CONFIRM A SMALL PIECE OF NATALIE'S TIMELINE BUT NOTHING MORE. KATZ PRESSES GERRY FOR MORE INFORMATION. WAS THERE ANYONE AT THE PARTY OR AT THE HOUSE PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO HIS MOM? GERRY DOES MENTION HIS MOM COULD HAVE HAD POSTPARTY PLANS HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT. HE STATED THAT NATALIE'S BOYFRIEND WAS IN TOWN, AND THAT HE AND SHE MAY HAVE GONE OUT TOGETHER, AND THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE REASON FOR HER NOT BEING ABLE TO BE CONTACTED. THE BOYFRIEND LIVES OUT OF STATE AND IS IN TOWN FOR ONLY A FEW DAYS. HE WAS VISITING WITH HIS MOTHER WHO RESIDES, I BELIEVE, IT WAS HIALEAH. THE SAME TOWN WHERE THE PARTY WAS, JUST 11 MILES AWAY FROM NATALIE'S HOME. IT'S THE BEST LEAD YET, AND KATZ FOLLOWS UP. IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME A BOYFRIEND MADE HIS GIRLFRIEND GO MISSING. WE SPOKE TO HIM TO SEE IF, UM, HE HAD SPOKEN WITH NATALIE AND IF HE HAD HEARD OF ANYTHING. SHE HASN'T CALLED YOU? NO. HE SAYS HE KNOWS NOTHING AND WAS HOME WITH HIS ELDERLY MOTHER ALL NIGHT. HE WASN'T WITH HER. HE HAD NOT SEEN HER AND DIDN'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS. WITH NO EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, KATZ HAS TO TAKE THE BOYFRIEND AT HIS WORD FOR NOW. HOURS PASS WITHOUT ANY MOVEMENT IN THE CASE AS THE FAMILY'S ANGUISH ONLY GROWS. THEN, A CALL COMES IN THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING. THE CALLER IS NATALIE BELMONTE'S NEIGHBOR. HIS HOME IS FITTED WITH TWO SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS WHICH CAPTURE PART OF NATALIE'S HOME. THEY HAD JUST RECENTLY INSTALLED THE CAMERAS ABOUT A MONTH PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT. THE NEIGHBORS CHECK THE FOOTAGE. AND WHEN HE SAW WHAT WAS ON IT, HE KNEW HE HAD TO CALL POLICE. POLICE ARE ABOUT TO GET A PRIVATE VIEWING OF THE NEIGHBORS FOOTAGE AND LEARN HOW RIGHT HE WAS TO CALL. STILL TO COME, A FANTASY GAMER VANISHES IN THE MIDST OF A HURRICANE, AND HIS BEST FRIEND WON'T STOP UNTIL SHE FINDS HIM. 43-YEAR-OLD MOTHER NATALIE BELMONTE HAS BEEN MISSING FOR 18 HOURS. WITH HER FAMILY DESPERATE FOR ANSWERS, POLICE HAVE THEIR FIRST SOLID LEAD. NATALIE'S NEIGHBOR HAS SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS THAT COVER THE FRONT OF HER HOME, AND THE CAMERAS WERE ROLLING ON THE NIGHT OF HER DISAPPEARANCE. DETECTIVE KATZ CANNOT WAIT TO SEE THE FOOTAGE. IF NATALIE DID SNEAK OUT TO SEE HER BOYFRIEND, OR IF THE BOYFRIEND SNUCK INTO SEE HER, THE CAMERA WOULD HAVE CAUGHT IT. WE PUT IT ON A LARGE SCREEN SO WE COULD SEE AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE. AT 2:50 A.M., THEY SEE NATALIE'S RED CAR COME BACK TO THE HOUSE JUST AS GERRY DESCRIBED. IT'S NOT UNTIL 5:12 A.M. THAT THERE'S MORE ACTIVITY. WE SAW A FIGURE EXIT THE HOME. WE SEE A RED CAR PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY FRONTWAYS. NATALIE'S CAR, AND SOMEONE'S CLIMBING INTO IT. IS THIS NATALIE SLIPPING AWAY TO MEET WITH HER BOYFRIEND? IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL. SUBJECT BACKS THE CAR OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY, PULLS FORWARD, BACKS THE CAR INTO THE DRIVEWAY, CLOSES THE CAR DOOR, SETS THE ALARM. YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHTS FLASHING ON THE CAR. WALKS BACK IN THE HOUSE. IT'S NOT NATALIE. IT'S THE FIGURE OF A MAN. THE CAR'S TRUNK IS NOW CLOSEST TO THE FRONT DOOR. MINUTES LATER, THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE OPENS AGAIN. GENTLEMAN THEN COMES OUT OF THE HOUSE, APPEARS TO BE DRAGGING SOMETHING. WETTERER'S EAGLE EYE KNOWS WHAT THIS IS. LOOKS LIKE IT'S WRAPPED IN A SHEET. AND HE PUTS THIS ITEM IN THE TRUNK. YOU COULD TELL HOW HE'S LIFTING IT, IT'S A HEAVY ITEM. I SAID, "THAT -- THAT'S -- THAT'S A PERSON." THAT IS A HUMAN BODY. BOTH DETECTIVES INSTINCTIVELY KNOW THIS MUST BE NATALIE'S REMAINS. THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF OUR NECK IS STANDING UP. WE ALL WERE JUST SITTIN' THERE IN -- IN REALLY DISBELIEF AT WHAT WE'RE -- WE'RE WATCHING. AFTER THAT, HE CLOSES THE TRUNK, AND HE LEAVES. THE SHADOWY FIGURE IN NATALIE'S RED CAR HAS TURNED THIS MISSING PERSON'S CASE INTO A HOMICIDE. BUT WHO IS THIS MAN? TO FIND OUT, POLICE MUST SCOUR THE VIDEO FRAME BY FRAME. AND THEY DECLARE NATALIE'S HOME A CRIME SCENE. THE FIRST 48 HOURS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT IN ANY -- ANY HOMICIDE. THE HOUSE IS SEALED OFF. AND WITH A KILLER ON THE LOOSE, NATALIE'S SONS GERRY AND AIDEN ARE PUT UP IN A MOTEL. THIS WAS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TIME FOR THEM. NOT KNOWING WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED WAS PROBABLY THE HARDEST TIME OF THEIR LIVES. WHILE THE FORENSICS UNIT BEGINS SWEEPING THE HOME FOR CLUES, DETECTIVE WETTERER PULLS AN ALL-NIGHTER WITH THE VIDEO. WE'RE NOT TAKING BREAKS. WE'RE GATHERING ALL THE EVIDENCE. YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT IN REAL TIME TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T MISS ANYTHING. THE TAPE REVEALS A FIGURE MOVING IN THE DISTANCE, BUT DETECTIVE WETTERER CAN'T MAKE OUT A FACE. COULD THIS BE NATALIE'S BOYFRIEND? THE TWO CAMERAS CONTAIN ALMOST 18 HOURS OF POTENTIAL EVIDENCE, OVER 10,000 FRAMES OF SURVEILLANCE. ANY ONE OF THEM COULD BE CRUCIAL. WE'RE GOING FRAME BY FRAME, MINUTE BY MINUTE IN REAL TIME. THE CAR LEAVES AT 5:16 A.M. THE VEHICLE RETURNS BACK A LITTLE OVER 8 MINUTES LATER, PARKS IN THE FRONT. PERSON GETS OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT. THE ALARM GOES ON. THAT PERSON GOES INSIDE THE HOUSE. AT 6:16 A.M., DAYLIGHT BEGINS TO BREAK, AND THE IMAGES GET EVEN CLEARER. WE SEE A FIGURE LEAVE THE FRONT DOOR CARRYING A WHITE TRASH BAG. GOES BACK INSIDE. MINUTES LATER, COMES OUT WITH TWO MORE WHITE TRASH BAGS. OPENS UP THE TRUNK AND PUTS ALL THREE OF THE BAGS INSIDE THE TRUNK. CLOSES THE TRUNK AND LEAVES AGAIN. NATALIE'S CAR RETURNS 8 MINUTES LATER. SO IF THE VEHICLE LEFT AND WAS BACK WITHIN 8 MINUTES, WE HAD A MAXIMUM RADIUS OF WHERE THE VEHICLE COULD HAVE WENT, AND THAT SET UP OUR SEARCH AREA. POLICE KNOW THEY ARE LOOKING FOR THREE TRASH BAGS AND A BODY, AND SOME 20 SQUARE MILES TO COVER. WE HAD TO STOP THE TRASH PICK-UP THEN TASKED OUR OFFICERS WITH DOING DETAIL SEARCHES. WE HAD WATERWAYS. WE HAD FIELDS AND WOODED AREAS, SHOPPING CENTERS, AND A MULTITUDE OF AREAS THAT NEEDED TO BE SEARCHED. SUDDENLY, NEWS COMES IN FROM THE OFFICERS SEARCHING THE EIGHT-MINUTE ZONE. THEY LOCATED A DUMPSTER IN A SHOPPING CENTER NEAR THE HOME, AND JUST SITTING IN THE DUMPSTER WERE THESE THREE LARGE TRASH BAGS. THERE WAS SHEETS, AND COMFORTERS, AND CLOTHING WITH BLOOD ON 'EM. WETTERER LOOKS AROUND. THERE MUST BE A CAMERA SOMEWHERE. HE'S IN LUCK. AT THE REAR OF A NEARBY GROCERY STORE -- A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. I WENT TO THE PUBLIX TO GO PULL THE VIDEO OF THE BACK AREA WHERE THE LOADING DOCK IS. HE CUES THE VIDEO TO 6:16 A.M., WHEN NATALIE'S CAR WAS CAUGHT LEAVING HER HOME. MINUTES LATER, HE SEES IT. NATALIE'S CAR DRIVING RIGHT PAST THE DUMPSTER AT 6:26. EVEN THOUGH THE VIDEO CAN'T SEE INSIDE THE CAR OR REVEAL THE DUMPSTER ITSELF, INVESTIGATORS ARE SURE THE BLOODY CLOTHES IN THE DUMPSTER CAME FROM NATALIE'S HOME, TRANSPORTED IN HER OWN CAR. BUT THE TWO MOST CRUCIAL QUESTIONS REMAIN, WHO WAS DRIVING, AND WHERE'S THE BODY? WE WERE EXCITED TO THE FACT THAT WE LOCATED THE ITEMS THAT WE OBSERVED ON THE VIDEO FOOTAGE. BUT WE'RE STILL MISSING NATALIE. AS SEARCH TEAMS WORK TIRELESSLY ALL AROUND PEMBROKE PINES, AN OFFICER SPOTS SOMETHING OMINOUS. THERE HAD BEEN SOME, VULTURES CIRCLING THE AREA. TYPICALLY WITH THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY, IT'S USUALLY SOME TYPE OF DECOMPOSITION. THIS TIME IT'S VULTURES, NOT VIDEO, THAT LEAD POLICE TO A GRUESOME FIND. I GOT THE PHONE CALL THAT IT APPEARED TO BE A WOMAN. IT'S A FOUR-MINUTE DRIVE FROM NATALIE BELMONTE'S HOME TO THE SPOT WHERE THE BODY LIES. NOW, TO CONFIRM HER IDENTITY. WETTERER GOES BACK TO THE SURVEILLANCE TAPES FROM THE NIGHT NATALIE DISAPPEARED TO MATCH THE DRESS ON THE BODY WITH WHAT NATALIE WAS WEARING THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER. BUT THE TAPES HOLD MORE THAN JUST ONE REVELATION. COMING UP, AN ECCENTRIC FANTASY GAMER DISAPPEARS UNTIL SECURITY CAMERAS REVEAL WHAT WAS REALLY IN THE CARDS. AFTER THREE DAYS OF SEARCHING FOR NATALIE BELMONTE, POLICE HAVE FOUND A WOMAN'S BODY FOUR MINUTES FROM HER HOME. IS IT NATALIE? DETECTIVE STEVE WETTERER STUDIES THE SURVEILLANCE TAPES FROM THE EVENING BEFORE THE MURDER. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS, WE COULD SEE WHAT NATALIE BELMONTE IS WEARING WHEN THEY WALK INTO THE WALGREENS STORE AND WHEN THEY WALK INTO THE HESS GAS STATION. SURVEILLANCE FROM THE DRUG STORE SHOWED CLEARLY THAT SHE WAS WEARING THE CLOTHES SHE WAS FOUND IN. JUST 8 HOURS LATER, SHE WOULD BE DEAD. IT'S THE LAST VIDEO, THE LAST PICTURE, THE LAST MOMENT THAT WE SEE NATALIE BELMONTE ALIVE. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER MORE STARTLING DISCOVERY. NOW, THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT NATALIE'S CLOTHES BUT HER ADOPTIVE SON GERRY'S. THOSE PARTICULAR PLAID SHORTS AND THAT WHITE POLO SHIRT WERE TWO OF THE ITEMS THAT WERE INSIDE THE GARBAGE BAG. DETECTIVES NOW HAVE ENOUGH TO ARREST GERRY LOPES. THE NEWS TEARS HIS FAMILY APART. THIS IS SOMEBODY THEY -- THEY TREATED AS A BROTHER, AS A SON. THIS IS SOMEONE THEY TREATED AS A NEPHEW, SOMEONE WHO THEY GAVE A LOVING HOME TO. BUT IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN THAT BECAUSE GERRY IS HIDING A SICK MOTIVE. DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUTOPSY, WE WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT NATALIE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY GERRY. ONE FAMILY MEMBER SAID THAT GERRY HAD THIS INFATUATION WITH NATALIE. HE ALWAYS HAD IT FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE. AFTER RETURNING HOME, GERRY ACTED ON HIS WORST IMPULSES. HE THEN MURDERED NATALIE IN SHAME AND CRUDELY DISPOSED OF HER BODY AND HIS BLOODY CLOTHES. SO THIS WAS HIS DEMENTED, TORMENTED, DELUSIONAL MIND WORKING. FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS DISGRACEFUL. IT'S DISGUSTING. IT'S THE WORST THING THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN TO A NICE PERSON. IT'S NOT JUST THE SECURITY CAMERAS -- IT'S THE POLICE SKILL IN INTERPRETING THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE THAT CAUGHT GERRY LOPES. LOPES ESCAPES THE DEATH PENALTY AND IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. NATALIE BELMONTE'S KILLING TORE THE HEART OUT OF A WARM AND LOVING FAMILY. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SUNSHINE STATE, POLICE INVESTIGATE A MURDER THAT TAKES THEM INTO A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD OF FANTASY AND DEATH. IT STARTS WITH A STORM. HURRICANE ISAAC IS HEADING STRAIGHT FOR PENSACOLA, FLORIDA, AND PATTY BURKE IS BATTENING DOWN THE HATCHES. WE LIVE ON THE WATER. THERE IS A LOT TO DO TO PREPARE. BUT WITH LANDFALL A DAY AWAY, THERE'S STILL TIME FOR HER LUNCH DATE. SHE'S MEETING SEAN DUGAS, AN ECCENTRIC FREE SPIRIT AND CLOSE FAMILY FRIEND WHOM SHE'S KNOWN SINCE HE WAS A BOY. HE LOVED PEOPLE. HE LOVED TO GET TO KNOW THEM. HE WOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU ABOUT HIMSELF. HE WAS INTERESTED IN THE PEOPLE HE WAS MEETING. SEAN WAS VERY WELL-KNOWN IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE HE WORKED FOR THE PENSACOLA NEWS JOURNAL. HELLO, AGAIN, EVERYONE. I'M SEAN DUGAS IT'S WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON HERE ON PENSACOLA BEACH, AND AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME, THE SURF IS JUST ROARING OUT HERE TODAY. HE WAS VERY RECOGNIZABLE. HE WAS TALL AND SLIM AND HAD A VERY ECLECTIC, THRIFT-STORE KIND OF STYLE. WHAT -- WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FLAVOR OF MOON PIE? STRAWBERRY. SEAN HAS BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THEIR GET-TOGETHER. JUST THAT MORNING, HE'D CALLED PATTY TO CONFIRM. HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD STILL BE COMING FOR LUNCH. AND I SAID I WOULD BE. BUT ODDLY, A STRANGER ANSWERS THE DOOR AND SAYS SEAN'S NOT HOME. THAT'S VERY STRANGE BECAUSE I JUST SPOKE TO HIM, AN HOUR AND A HALF PRIOR. SO MUCH FOR THEIR LUNCH DATE. THE STORM HITS THE NEXT DAY. PATTY COMES THROUGH IT FINE AND WONDERS IF SEAN DID TOO. I TRIED TO REACH SEAN EVERY DAY. BUT SHE CAN'T REACH HIM. I WOULD CALL BEFORE I WENT TO BED AT NIGHT AND WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING. AND I WOULD CALL, AND I WOULD CALL, AND I WOULD CALL. REPEATED ATTEMPTS DAILY. NOW, I'M WORRIED. I HADN'T HEARD FROM HIM IN MANY DAYS. 11 DAYS IN ALL. FINALLY, PATTY CHECKS IN ON SEAN IN PERSON. I PEERED INTO THE WINDOWS AND VERY QUICKLY REALIZED THAT HIS HOUSE HAD BEEN CLEANED OUT. THE FURNITURE WAS GONE. THE ONLY THING REMAINING IN THE HOUSE WAS THIS OVERSIZED TV. I WAS VERY, VERY CONCERNED. THE FIRST THING THAT I FELT WAS FEAR. IT'S NOT LIKE OUTGOING SEAN DUGAS TO GO SILENT. MAYBE THE NEIGHBORS KNOW SOMETHING. THAT'S WHEN PATTY LEARNS ABOUT SOME STRANGE ACTIVITY FOUR DAYS EARLIER. THE NEIGHBORS TOLD ME THAT A U-HAUL WAS IN THE DRIVEWAY, AND TWO YOUNG MEN WERE MOVING ALL OF THE ITEMS OUT OF THE HOME INTO THE U-HAUL. THE NEIGHBOR ASKED THE MAN, "WHAT IS YOUR NAME? WHO ARE YOU?" AND HE RESPONDED, "WILL." WILL EXPLAINED THAT HE AND THE OTHER MAN WERE HELPING SEAN MOVE OUT AND INTO THEIR PLACE. THE FACT THAT SEAN WASN'T PRESENT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. SEAN WOULD NEVER CHOOSE TO MOVE. THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY WRONG. PATTY'S NOW CONVINCED SOMETHING BAD HAS HAPPENED TO HER FRIEND. SHE REPORTS HIS DISAPPEARANCE TO THE PENSACOLA POLICE, BUT THEY'VE GOT THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE WAKE OF THE HURRICANE. BESIDES, SEAN'S A GROWN MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE LEFT OF HIS OWN VOLITION. UNTIL WE HAVE INFORMATION OR EVIDENCE THAT INDICATES THAT AN ACTUAL CRIME HAS OCCURRED, UM, IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A CRIME. SOMETIMES PEOPLE LEAVE. BUT PATTY WON'T LET IT GO. SEAN IS CONSIDERATE AND EXTROVERTED AND WOULD NEVER UP AND LEAVE WITHOUT TELLING HER. WITNESSES CAN'T RECALL ALL THE DETAILS, SO WHILE IT WAS VERY FRESH IN MY MIND, I MADE THE TIMELINE. SHE BRINGS IT TO DETECTIVE DANIEL HARNETT. HOPEFULLY, SHE CAN PERSUADE HIM TO LOOK INTO HER FRIEND'S DISAPPEARANCE. DETECTIVE HARNETT KNEW SEAN FROM HIS DAYS ON THE CRIME BEAT FOR THE PENSACOLA NEWS JOURNAL. AND HE'S ALWAYS RESPECTED SEAN'S WORK. HE WAS VERY PERSISTENT. I WOULDN'T LIKE TO SAY PUSHY, BUT HE WAS ALMOST PUSHY IN REGARDS TO WANTING TO, YOU KNOW, DO HIS JOB AS A REPORTER. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT SEAN THE DETECTIVE DOESN'T KNOW. PATTY EXPLAINS THAT HER FRIEND HAS SPENT YEARS TRAWLING THE UNDERGROUND WORLD OF A FANTASY ROLE-PLAYING GAME THE GATHERING. FOR ITS FANS, IT'S ALL-CONSUMING. ALL I KNOW IS THAT YOU USE, A DECK OF CARDS. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THEM. EACH OF THEM IS A CHARACTER OF SOME SORT. TO WIN THE GAME IS TO REMAIN ALIVE AND KILL OFF ALL THE OTHER PLAYERS. IT'S A NEVER-ENDING MAKE-BELIEVE BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL, BUT SOME PLAYERS TAKE IT TOO FAR. THE GATHERING HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AS BEING VERY ADDICTIVE, AND IT'S BEEN CALLED CARDBOARD CRACK. SEAN'S HABIT HAS WON HIM SOME HIGH-END CARDS. EACH OF THEM HAS A DIFFERENT VALUE, AND I BELIEVE THE MOST VALUABLE ONE IS THE BLACK WIDOW, WHICH SEAN HAD. IN THIS WORLD, THE CARDS ARE WORTH A REAL-WORLD FORTUNE. I'D HEARD ESTIMATES FROM $25,000 TO $100,000 ON THE ENTIRE COLLECTION. A MOTIVE FOR FOUL PLAY? OR MAYBE SEAN TOOK OFF WITH HIS VALUABLES IN TOW. THE DETECTIVE TRIES TO PICK UP HIS TRAIL. HIS PHONE WASN'T WORKING. UM, HIS CREDIT CARDS WEREN'T BEING USED. ALL OF HIS BELONGINGS WERE GONE, AND NO ONE KNOWS WHERE HE'S GONE. IT'S AS THOUGH SEAN SIMPLY STOPPED EXISTING... THAT IS WHAT GAVE US A LOT OF RED FLAGS. HE'S COMPLETELY UPROOTED HIMSELF, AND THAT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO DO. UNTIL REAL-WORLD SURVEILLANCE VIDEO UPENDS THE FANTASY LAND. FANTASY GAMER SEAN DUGAS' HOME IS STRIPPED BARE. A MAN NAMED WILL TOLD NEIGHBOR SEAN WAS MOVING IN WITH HIM. BUT SEAN IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. THE ANSWER LAY IN FINDING THE MEN ASSOCIATED WITH SEAN. IF I COULD FIND THEM, I COULD FIND SEAN. DETECTIVES QUESTION SEAN'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY ABOUT ANY ACQUAINTANCE NAMED WILL. ONE NAME KEEPS COMING UP -- WILL CORMIER. AND HE HAS A TWIN BROTHER, CHRISTOPHER. ARE THEY THE SAME TWO MEN THE NEIGHBORS SAW MOVING SEAN'S BELONGINGS IN A U-HAUL TRUCK? DETECTIVE HARNETT CAN'T FIND ANY KNOWN ADDRESSES FOR THE TWINS IN PENSACOLA, SO HE ASKS THE TRUCK RENTAL COMPANY FOR CUSTOMER RECORDS AND SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE. IT TAKES WEEKS OF CALLING AND SEARCHING. IT'S STARTING TO FEEL LIKE THIS MYSTERY WILL NEVER BE SOLVED. THEN, CUSTOMER RECORDS FROM U-HAUL ARRIVE. I GOT THOSE RECORDS BACK, AND IT GAVE ME SOME PLACE TO GO. THE RECORDS REVEAL THAT IT WAS THE CORMIER TWINS WHO RENTED THE TRUCK. I HAVE A START PLACE. THE RENTAL WAS ON THE SAME DAY NEIGHBORS SAW THE TWO MEN AT SEAN'S HOME, BUT THE PACKAGE CONTAINS SOMETHING EVEN BETTER. WE HAVE THE CORRESPONDING VIDEO OF THAT RENTAL. THE VIDEO IS FROM 11:03 A.M., SEVEN DAYS AFTER PATTY AND SEAN WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE LUNCH. WE SEE THE BROTHERS COMING IN AND RENTING THE TRUCK. IT'S DETECTIVES' FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE CORMIER TWINS, A PERFECT MATCH OF THE DESCRIPTION PROVIDED BY SEAN'S NEIGHBOR. AND THE MAN ON THE RIGHT IS THE SAME ONE WHO OPENED THE DOOR TO PATTY THAT DAY. INSIDE YOUR OWN MIND, YOU'RE HIGH-FIVING, AND YOU'VE INITIALLY GOT THE BREAK. BUT AS HE WATCHES, SOMETHING DAWNS ON HIM. THIS IS SEAN'S HOME MOVE, BUT THERE'S NO SEAN IN ANY OF THE FOOTAGE AND NO CAMERAS CAPTURING THEM RETURNING THE TRUCK. WHERE HAVE THEY GONE? IT STARTED TO BECOME CLEAR THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING AMISS. IF DETECTIVE HARNETT CAN FIND THAT TRUCK, MAYBE HE'LL FIND THE CORMIER TWINS. HE SCOURS U-HAUL RENTAL RECORDS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY TO SEE WHERE THE TRUCK WAS RETURNED. THE HARD WORK PAYS OFF. THAT TRUCK WAS RETURNED AT A U-HAUL DEALERSHIP IN WINDER, GEORGIA. 400 MILES FROM PENSACOLA, FLORIDA. I HAVE WINDER, GEORGIA. AND NOW I HAVE SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO. THE U-HAUL OFFICE IN GEORGIA CONFIRMS THE TRUCK WAS INDEED RETURNED BY SOMEONE NAMED CORMIER, BUT NOT ONE OF THE BROTHERS. IT WAS THEIR FATHER, BILL. SO, NOW I HAD A PHONE NUMBER, AND I HAD A RELATIVE. A FRIENDLY PHONE CALL TO BILL CORMIER MIGHT YIELD A BREAK IN THE CASE. I EXPLAINED TO HIM SIMPLY THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY IN TROUBLE. I WAS TRYING TO LOCATE SEAN, A FRIEND OF THEIRS. HE INDICATED THAT SEAN HAD NOT MOVED TO GEORGIA WITH EITHER OF HIS SONS. HE HADN'T SEEN THEM OR HEARD FROM THEM IN SEVERAL MONTHS. UPON ENDING THE CONVERSATION, I REALIZED THAT SOMETHING WAS VERY, VERY WRONG. BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT. SEAN HAS BEEN MISSING FOR SIX WEEKS. DETECTIVE HARNETT'S FINAL LEAD HAS JUST DRIED UP. AN HOUR LATER, AN URGENT CALL COMES IN. HARNETT. YEAH. IT'S AN AGITATED MALE WITH SOMETHING TO CONFESS. BILL CORMIER'S CALLED BACK. HE CALLED ME IN A STATE OF PANIC. IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HE WAS OUT OF BREATH. HE EXPLAINS TO ME THAT HE HAS LEFT THE HOUSE, THAT HIS SONS ARE IN THE HOME, AND HE HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE HE WAS SCARED. WHY IS BILL AFRAID OF HIS OWN SONS? HARNETT NEEDS TO GET TO HIM AND FAST, BUT HE'S 400 MILES AWAY. MY MAIN OBJECTIVE AT THAT POINT WAS TO GET LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HANDS-ON TO BILL. GEORGIA INVESTIGATOR RIKKI BANKS IS DISPATCHED TO BILL CORMIER'S HOME. YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT -- WHAT COULD HAPPEN WHEN YOU GET THERE, OF COURSE. SO THAT'S KIND OF PLAYING THROUGH MY MIND. OUT FRONT, A PANICKED BILL CORMIER IS WAITING. HE SAYS HIS SONS HAVE FLED. BUT BANKS ASKED TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND JUST TO BE SURE. SHE CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE SOME NEW CONSTRUCTION. ON THE WALKWAY, WE DID OBSERVE SOME CONCRETE... AND A SHOVEL THAT WAS LAYING, YOU KNOW, SEVERAL FEET AWAY FROM THE PILE OF LEAVES. IT'S NOT A PATIO OR A BARBECUE PIT. IT'S JUST CONCRETE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD. BANKS ALSO FINDS A RECEIPT FOR THE PURCHASE OF FIVE BAGS OF CONCRETE MADE JUST A FEW DAYS EARLIER. HER BOSS, INVESTIGATOR RACHEL LOVE, FOLLOWS UP ON THE PURCHASE. I WENT TO THE HOME DEPOT WHICH IS LOCATED IN WINDER. THE STORE HAS MULTIPLE CAMERAS INSIDE AND OUT. SHE PULLS THE VIDEO THAT CORRESPONDS WITH THE TIME STAMP ON THE RECEIPT. AND REVIEWING THE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF THAT SPECIFIC DATE AND TIME SHOWED US BOTH WILLIAM AND CHRISTOPHER. IT'S THE CORMIER TWINS. LOVE TRACKS EVERY MOVE OF THEIR VISIT. WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THEM RETRIEVE ITEMS, CHECK OUT AS THEY PURCHASED THE ITEMS -- CONCRETE, A BUCKET, A CONCRETE STIRRER. THEN WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THEM LOAD THE ITEMS INTO THE CAR THAT THEY CAME IN. WHAT THE CAMERAS SEE IS AN ORDINARY SHOPPING TRIP, BUT WHAT LIES BENEATH THE FRESHLY LAID CONCRETE IN BILL CORMIER'S YARD IS ANYTHING BUT. 12 DAYS AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF PENSACOLA JOURNALIST SEAN DUGAS, AN IN-STORE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE TAPE HAS CAUGHT WILL AND CHRISTOPHER CORMIER ON A SUSPICIOUS SHOPPING TRIP. WE THEN ORDERED SOME EQUIPMENT TO BE BROUGHT IN TO HELP US TRY TO LIFT THAT CONCRETE UP. WE'RE STILL ANXIOUS BUT NOT SURE OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA FIND. AS IT WAS LIFTED UP SEVERAL FEET, WE COULD SEE UP UNDER THE CONCRETE, THERE WAS A PLASTIC CONTAINER. WE GOT IT PULLED BACK. EXPOSING A TELLTALE ODOR. IT WAS REALLY BAD. IT WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING DECOMPOSING. THEN THERE WAS WHAT APPEARED TO BE A BODY. AFTER THE AUTOPSY, WE'RE ABLE TO SAY DEFINITIVELY THAT THIS WAS SEAN DUGAS. NOW, COPS ALL OVER THE SOUTH ARE ON THE HUNT FOR THE CORMIER BROTHERS. I GET A PHONE CALL FROM ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER WHO HAS CONDUCTED A TRAFFIC STOP. WHEN THE OFFICER LOOKED IN THE CAR, THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER LOOKED IDENTICAL. I ASKED THERE THAT THEY BE BROUGHT TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. POLICE SHOW THE TWINS THE FOOTAGE OF THEIR CONCRETE PURCHASE. AND CHRISTOPHER CORMIER IS THE FIRST TO CRACK. HE EXPLAINS THAT HE AND WILL KNEW SEAN FROM THEIR MARATHON GAMES OF MAGIC: THE GATHERING, AND COVETED HIS VALUABLE CARD COLLECTION, SO MUCH SO THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO KILL FOR IT, BLUDGEONING SEAN TO DEATH. WHAT WE LEARNED WAS THAT SEAN WAS MURDERED. HIS BELONGINGS WERE STOLEN. HE'D BEEN DEAD ONLY A FEW HOURS WHEN PATTY SHOWED UP FOR LUNCH. HIS BODY WAS LEFT IN HIS GARAGE FOR A WEEK. HE WAS REMOVED FROM -- FROM HIS GARAGE, PLACED INTO A U-HAUL TRUCK. HE WAS TRANSPORTED TO GEORGIA AND BURIED. IT WAS VERY GRUESOME. SEAN MUST HAVE ENDURED A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN. IT TOOK MY STOMACH AWAY. THE ONLY CONCILIATORY THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH, AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS FINE NOW. WILLIAM CORMIER IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. HIS TWIN, CHRISTOPHER, GETS 15 YEARS. HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE, BOTH WOULD STILL BE ON THE LOOSE TODAY. TWO MURDERS IN FLORIDA, TWO DEEPLY DISTURBED MOTIVES. WITH SECURITY CAMERAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE, INVESTIGATORS ARE ABLE TO CRACK BOTH CASES. MEANWHILE, THE CAMERAS KEEP WATCHING.
