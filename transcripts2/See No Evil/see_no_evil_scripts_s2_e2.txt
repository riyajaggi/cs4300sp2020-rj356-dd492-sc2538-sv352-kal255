 THURSDAY, MARCH 31st, 2011. DENVER, COLORADO. 19-YEAR-OLD STUDENT KENIA MONGE IS HANGING OUT AT THE FAMILY HOUSE WITH MOM AND YOUNGER SISTER KIM. HEY, CHECK THIS OUT. SHE'S JUST FINISHED A SEMESTER IN BROADCASTING AT A LOCAL COLLEGE. THAT'S PRETTY. KENIA KEPT A PRETTY ACTIVE SOCIAL LIFE. I LIKE IT. SHE DID WHAT ALL THE FRIENDS WERE DOING. THEY LIKED TO GO OUT AND PARTY. WHAT NAIL POLISH IS THIS?

 I GOT TO GO. KENIA'S BOYFRIEND, LOUIS EASTON, ARRIVES TO GIVE KENIA A RIDE BACK TO THEIR APARTMENT BEFORE SHE HEADS OUT FOR A NIGHT ON THE TOWN. SHE WAS JUST A REALLY GOOD PERSON. SHE HAD A REALLY GOOD HEART. YOU KNOW, THE FUN THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES. SHE WAS LIKE 4'11", REALLY LITTLE. AT 19, KENIA'S NOT OLD ENOUGH TO VISIT DENVER'S BARS AND CLUBS. BUT HER BOYFRIEND, LOUIS, MANAGES A 16-AND-OVER HOOKAH BAR. WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING, SHE LOOKED AT ME. AND SHE SAID, "BYE." AND I WAS BLOWING KISSES TO HER. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN JUST A NORMAL DAY IN THE LIFE OF THIS PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN. BUT IT WASN'T. THE NEXT DAY, APRIL 1st, KENIA'S FAMILY GETS THE FIRST SIGN THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG. HER BOYFRIEND CALLED ME. HEY, KIMBERLY. AND HE ASKED ME IF I'VE SPOKEN TO HER. AND I TOLD HIM, "NO." AND YOU HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER? AND HE SAID, "WELL, SHE DIDN'T COME HOME. AND SHE'S MISSING." AND I WAS JUST LIKE, "OKAY, THIS IS, LIKE, SOME SICK APRIL FOOL'S JOKE." HI. I KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. NOBODY'S HEARD ANYTHING. I CALLED MY JOB. AND I WENT HOME. DAD. THIS IS NO APRIL FOOL'S JOKE. HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING? NO. ME AND KENIA SPOKE TO EACH OTHER ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. IT WAS KIND OF WEIRD IF WE DIDN'T SPEAK TO EACH OTHER. - HAS SHE CALLED YOU AT ALL? - NO. JUST CHECK. TRY CALLING HER AGAIN. KENIA'S FATHER GROWS MORE AND MORE WORRIED BY THE MINUTE. AND LET US KNOW IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING AT ALL. HE TRACKS DOWN THE GIRLS KENIA WAS WITH THE NIGHT BEFORE. KENIA? GEEGEE AND BRITTANY SHOW UP AT THE HOUSE. HI. THE FAMILY HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. I WAS JUST LIKE, "OKAY, SO WHERE'S MY SISTER? YOU GUYS SHOULD HAVE CALLED WAY EARLIER." TALK TO ME. YEAH, WE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE HERE. THEY SAW THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION. AND THEY STARTED TELLING ME THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AND THE TRUTH WAS THEY HADN'T BEEN TO LOUIS' 16-AND-OVER BAR. WE WENT TO A CLUB LAST NIGHT. A CLUB? "HOW ARE YOU GUYS GETTING INTO THESE CLUBS?" IT WAS ONLY THAT EVENING WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT WE'VE GOT FALSE IDs. USING THOSE FAKE IDs, THE GIRLS GET INTO A DOWNTOWN BAR CALLED 24K. HAVE FUN. THEY WERE JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME, EXPECTING TO MEET UP AT THE END OF THE NIGHT AND GO HOME TOGETHER... ...SO NO ONE WAS REALLY WATCHING WHAT EVERYONE ELSE WAS DOING. LATER, THE GIRLS REALIZE KENIA'S GONE. MAYBE SHE LEFT WITH THAT GUY? THAT'S HERS. THIS IS HERS. IF YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE JUST STAYED TOGETHER AND DIDN'T LET MY SISTER LEAVE ANYWHERE, THEN NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. THE GIRLS HAND OVER KENIA'S PURSE AND CELLPHONE. MY GOD. SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE BECAUSE I KNOW ONE THING THAT SHE WOULD NEVER BE WITHOUT WAS HER CELLPHONE, PERIOD. IT'S A HUGE RED FLAG FOR KENIA'S FAMILY. AND PANIC TAKES HOLD. WE CAN GET SOME INFORMATION. THAT IS WHEN I IMMEDIATELY DECIDED I NEEDED TO MAKE A MISSING PERSON'S REPORT. I NEED TO REPORT MY DAUGHTER MISSING. AND THE OFFICER ON THE DESK TOOK ALL OF THAT INFORMATION. HER NAME IS KENIA MONGE. HE SAID, "WITHIN THE FIRST 72 HOURS, THEY USUALLY COME HOME." TONY CAN ONLY HOPE THE OFFICER IS RIGHT. KENIA BECAME TONY'S STEP-DAUGHTER WHEN HE MARRIED HER MOM, MARIA. THE FAMILY ALL CAME TOGETHER IN 2004. I WAS SO HAPPY. I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING WAS SO PERFECT TO ME ON THAT DAY. MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF HER WHEN SHE FIRST GOT HERE WAS HOW SHORT SHE WAS. I MEAN, SHE WAS 4'11" AND INITIALLY VERY SHY. "MY GOODNESS. I HAVE A SISTER NOW. THIS IS SO WEIRD." I WAS SO EXCITED. I WAS LIKE, "NOW I CAN DO EVERYTHING WITH HER." SHE WAS MY ROLE MODEL. SHE WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED TO BE. THE CLOCK IS TICKING. IF KENIA IS TO BE FOUND, INVESTIGATORS NEED TO START TRACKING HER AND FAST. DETECTIVES LOUIS ASTRADA AND NASH GURULE TAKE CHARGE OF THE CASE. THEY CALL IN DEPUTY D.A. KERRI LOMBARDI. SHE ALSO WORKS FOR THE MISSING PERSONS UNIT. WHEN SOMEONE'S MISSING, ALL YOU CAN REALLY DO IS GO BACKWARDS AND SEE WHERE THEY'D BEEN AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON TO SEE THEM. ASTRADA QUESTIONS GEEGEE, THE FRIEND KENIA WAS WITH THE NIGHT SHE WENT MISSING. SHE DESCRIBES A TYPICAL NIGHT OUT... BRITTANY AND I WENT TO GO GET SOME DRINKS AND... ...EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. I MEAN, I REMEMBER HER DANCING WITH THIS GUY. SHE WAS DANCING IN THE BAR WITH A GUY. AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW, BOTH HER AND THE GUY ARE GONE. THEY THOUGHT SHE WENT TO THE BATHROOM AND REALLY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT SHE WAS GONE UNTIL THE BAR CLOSED. KENIA? AND THAT'S WHEN THEY ALL REALIZED THAT, "YOU KNOW, WE STILL HAVE KENIA'S PURSE. WE STILL HAVE HER CAR KEYS. WE HAVE HER CELLPHONE, AND THERE'S NO KENIA." POLICE HEAD TO THE LAST PLACE ANYONE SAW KENIA -- THE 24K BAR IN DOWNTOWN DENVER. DETECTIVES SHOW BAR STAFF KENIA'S IMAGE. WHAT DID THEY SEE? DID THEY SEE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS? DID THEY SEE A MAN ARGUING WITH A YOUNG WOMAN? BUT IN SUCH A BUSY BAR, IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF EVERYONE WHO COMES AND GOES. DO YOU HAVE ANY UP HERE? AND THAT'S WHEN THEY SPOT WHAT COULD BE THEIR BEST WITNESS. THERE ARE MULTIPLE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS WATCHING THE BAR AROUND THE CLOCK. STARTING AT THE BAR THAT SHE WAS AT WITH HER FRIENDS, WE'VE GOT AS MUCH SURVEILLANCE AS WAS POSSIBLE. THE FOOTAGE IS LOADED INTO THE SYSTEM. YOU'RE HOPING TO FIND OUT, WHERE WAS SHE? WHAT TIME IS IT? HOW DOES SHE LOOK? WHO'S SHE WITH? THEY QUEUE UP THE FIRST TAPE. THEY EXPECT THIS WILL GIVE THEM THE BEST CHANCE TO SEE MORE OF THE BAR THAN ANY OTHER CAMERA AT 24K. CAN YOU GO BACK A LITTLE? I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS. THEY SCAN THE THURSDAY NIGHT CROWD, DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR ANY SIGN OF KENIA... ...A GIRL IN A SHORT, BLACK DRESS. NO, ALL I'M SEEING IS BAR STAFF. THEN, FROM BEHIND A GROUP OF DANCERS, THEY SPOT SOMETHING. IT'S RIGHT THERE. FREEZE ON THAT. LET'S PULL THAT ONE UP. THE MYSTERIOUS STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED TO KENIA MONGE BEGINS ON THE FLOOR OF THIS BAR. 19-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE STUDENT KENIA MONGE IS MISSING. SHE DISAPPEARED AFTER A NIGHT OUT WITH FRIENDS. NOW, DETECTIVES HAVE A WITNESS THAT MAY HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING. THE TEAM GATHERED TO SCRUTINIZE THE FOOTAGE FROM SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS AT THE BAR, 24K... ...LOOKING FOR ANY SIGN OF KENIA OR THE MYSTERY MAN SHE WAS ALLEGEDLY WITH. THEY SEE SOMETHING. THERE, FREEZE ON THAT. LET'S PULL THAT ONE UP. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A WOMAN IN A SHORT, BLACK DRESS. IS IT KENIA? THEY PUSH IN TIGHTER. THEY NEED ONE TELLING DETAIL FROM THE SECURITY FOOTAGE. POLICE KNOW KENIA WAS WEARING RED SHOES THE NIGHT SHE WENT MISSING. THE GIRL IN THE BLACK DRESS AND BLACK SHOES ISN'T KENIA. 2:00 A.M.? APPROXIMATELY. AT 1:40 A.M., KENIA'S FRIENDS, GEEGEE AND BRITTANY, WERE STILL IN THE CLUB, WHO, AS OF NOW, ARE THE LAST TO HAVE SEEN HER ALIVE. THEY LOAD UP THE FOOTAGE FROM CAMERA TWO. IT'S DIRECTLY ABOVE THE DANCE FLOOR, BUT THERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM. NO. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ON THAT ONE. IF A LIGHT IS POINTING INTO THE LENS, THEY WON'T GET A THING FROM CAMERA TWO. ANY BAR'S MOST IMPORTANT CAMERAS COVER THE FRONT DOOR. YEAH, THERE SHE IS. YEAH. RIGHT THERE. THEY KNOW GEEGEE, BRITTANY, AND KENIA ARRIVE AT 24K. THEY ENTER THE BAR AT JUST AFTER 11:30 P.M. NOW THEY CAN ESTABLISH A TIMELINE. PULL THAT ONE UP. YEP. IF KENIA ARRIVED, SHE MUST HAVE LEFT, AND THEY NEED TO KNOW WHO WITH. ALL RIGHT. UNTIL THEY KNOW THAT, THE INVESTIGATION IS AT A DEAD END. ROLL FORWARD TO THE END OF THE... IT'S A QUARTER TO 2:00. THE BAR IS ABOUT TO CLOSE. GEEGEE AND BRITTANY ARE AMONG THE LAST OUT OF THE DOOR. WHERE IS SHE? BUT KENIA ISN'T CAUGHT ON CAMERA LEAVING. WE LOOKED FOR ANY FOOTAGE OF HER DURING THE TIME SHE WAS THERE OR LEAVING THE BAR AND THEY HAD NONE, SO ANOTHER DEAD END. THE MYSTERY ONLY DEEPENS. KENIA ENTERS THE BAR. BUT POLICE NEVER SEE HER LEAVE, AT LEAST, OUT THE FRONT DOOR. MEANWHILE, KENIA'S FAMILY LAUNCHES A SEARCH OF THEIR OWN. THERE'S NO STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING. SO YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT. "OKAY, NOW WHAT DO WE DO?" WE GET SEARCH PARTIES TOGETHER AND WE GET THESE RUDIMENTARY FLIERS TOGETHER. SOME OF HER FRIENDS WERE WITH US. AND WE WERE JUST POSTING PICTURES, ASKING PEOPLE AROUND IF THEY'VE SEEN MY SISTER. I ALWAYS HAD THAT THOUGHT IN MY HEAD THAT SHE WAS GONNA COME BACK HOME. LEAD INVESTIGATORS ASTRADA AND GURULE HEAD BACK TO THE CLUB. WORKING? YES, I WAS. OKAY. DO YOU WANT TO SHOW HIM THE PICTURE? AND WHEN THEY QUESTION THE BOUNCERS... HAD TO KICK HER OUT, THOUGH. HOW COME? ...THEY UNCOVER SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT. KENIA AND THIS GUY HAD BEEN KICKED OUT OF THE BAR AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE SHE APPEARED TO BE INTOXICATED. THE BOUNCER WALKED KENIA AND A YOUNG MAN THROUGH THE BAR AND SHOWED THEM OUT THROUGH THE BACK DOOR. THAT'S WHY NO CAMERA AT THE FRONT DOOR EVER CAPTURED KENIA LEAVING THE CLUB. SHE LEFT HER PURSE AND MONEY AND HER CELLPHONE AND HER KEYS BEHIND. YOU KNOW, WAS SHE JUST SO INTOXICATED THAT SHE DID THAT? HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO KICK HER OUT, REALLY. WAS SHE, WAS SHE WITH ANYBODY? THE BOUNCER GIVES DETECTIVES ANOTHER VALUABLE CLUE. HE HAD SEEN KENIA AND THIS GUY GOING IN THE DIRECTION OF 15th AND CALIFORNIA. RIGHT THERE. YEP. WITHOUT THAT TIP, POLICE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN WHERE TO LOOK. SO THEY STARTED NOW LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF SURVEILLANCE VIDEO THAT PICKED UP KENIA AND WHOEVER SHE WAS WITH. BAR 24K ISN'T THE ONLY DENVER BUSINESS WITH SECURITY CAMERAS. INVESTIGATORS DISCOVER THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF CAMERAS FROM SIDEWALKS, LOCAL BUSINESSES, AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS. SO 15th AND CALIFORNIA IS CALLED 24. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA START OUR SEARCH FROM. WE NEED TO GET ALL THE CAMERAS. IT WAS A BIG TASK. OFFICERS WERE GOING TO ALL THOSE BUSINESSES. AND SOME OF THEM WOULD GO IN, AND YOU COULD VIEW THE FOOTAGE THERE. AND IF THERE WAS SOMETHING, THEY COULD DOWNLOAD THAT OR TAKE IT. POLICE ROUND UP FOOTAGE FROM EVERY CAMERA ON 15th STREET AND BRING IT INTO HEADQUARTERS. WE NEED YOU GUYS TO GO THROUGH IT ALL, FRAME BY FRAME. THE BOUNCER SAYS HE KICKED KENIA AND THE YOUNG MAN OUT AROUND 1:00 A.M., SO THEY REWIND THE TAPES TO JUST AFTER 1:00. WEARING A BLACK DRESS, RED SHOES. COMB THROUGH EVERY SINGLE FRAME, GUYS, OKAY? WITH THE CLOCK TICKING, THEY GO TAPE BY TAPE. AND FINALLY, WHEN THEY CHECK VIDEO FROM A 15th STREET APARTMENT BUILDING, THEY HIT PAY DIRT. GURULE'S GOT SOMETHING HERE. KENIA MONGE HAS NOW BEEN MISSING FOR FIVE DAYS. SHE'S LIKE THIS TALL. SHE WAS LAST SEEN AT A DENVER NIGHTCLUB. POLICE KNOW THAT SHE ARRIVED, BUT SHE DIDN'T LEAVE THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR. POLICE HAVE ROUNDED UP TAPE FROM DOZENS OF OTHER DOWNTOWN DENVER CAMERAS. AND THEY'VE JUST FOUND THEIR FIRST CITING OF KENIA SINCE SHE LEFT THE BAR. GURULE'S GOT SOMETHING HERE. YEAH, THAT'S HER WALKING. IT'S KENIA MONGE. AND SHE'S NOT ALONE. YOU SEE THAT? THAT'S HER. THAT'S DEFINITELY HER. I'M GONNA CALL KERRI. DETECTIVES HAVE STRUCK GOLD. THIS APARTMENT BUILDING HAS A SWARM OF SECURITY CAMERAS. A YOUNG MAN ENTERS THE LOBBY CARRYING HIS SHOES. KENIA IS NOT FAR BEHIND, HOLDING HER OWN DISTINCTIVE RED SHOES. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYONE IS FORCING KENIA TO BE THERE. BUT SHE IS VERY UNSTEADY ON HER FEET. WHO'S THIS GUY SHE'S WITH? I MEAN, COULD THIS PERSON HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER DISAPPEARANCE? POLICE NEED TO KNOW, WHO'S THE WHITE MAN IN THE BLACK T-SHIRT AND RED SLEEVES? THEY GO BACK AND REPLAY THE FOOTAGE, FRAME BY FRAME. YEAH, THAT'S DEFINITELY HER. SHE GOT INTO AN ELEVATOR WITH HIM. THAT WAS REAL EVIDENCE OF WHERE SHE HAD BEEN AND AT WHAT TIME. AT 1:15 A.M., A CAMERA ON THE FIFTH FLOOR PICKS UP THE TRAIL. DETECTIVES GET A CLOSER LOOK AT THE MAN. HE CASUALLY TOSSES HIS SHOES. KENIA DOESN'T LOOK DISTRESSED... ...BUT SHE'S CLEARLY INTOXICATED AND VULNERABLE. KENIA AND THE MYSTERY MAN DISAPPEAR OUT OF THE FRAME WITH NO OTHER CLUE AS TO WHERE THEY GO NEXT. AT LEAST DETECTIVES KNOW THAT KENIA WAS ALIVE AND WELL AT 1:16 A.M. ON THE MORNING SHE VANISHED. EVERYONE THOUGHT, "WELL, MAYBE HE KNOWS SOMETHING? MAYBE THIS IS THE PERSON THAT KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO KENIA?" DETECTIVES HEAD FOR THE LOFT APARTMENTS LOOKING FOR THE MYSTERY MAN SEEN WITH KENIA. THEY HEAD TO THE FIFTH FLOOR. POLICE NEED TO KNOW WHICH APARTMENT KENIA AND THE MYSTERY MAN GO IN. SO THEY START KNOCKING ON DOORS. THEY REACH APARTMENT 103. IT'S THE MAN FROM THE FOOTAGE. HIS NAME IS CADE DOUGLAS. THEY BRING DOUGLAS TO HEADQUARTERS THEN START TO INTERROGATE HIM. YEAH, THAT'S -- THAT'S IT. TELL ME THE STORY FROM THE CLUB TO YOUR APARTMENT. OKAY, SO I'M AT THE CLUB... CADE ADMITS THAT HE MET KENIA AT THE CLUB. I'M DANCING. I SEE THIS PRETTY GIRL OVER THERE. WHAT'S A GUY GONNA DO, RIGHT? GOES OVER, STARTS DANCING WITH HER. AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAD A GOOD TIME. WE WERE DANCING. WE BOTH GOT A BIT DRUNK. THEN SHE GOT KICKED OUT. GO, GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. AFTER THEY WERE THROWN OUT OF THE BAR, CADE OFFERS TO TAKE KENIA BACK TO HIS PLACE, JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY. WE WENT BACK TO MY PLACE. COME ON IN. BUT KENIA DOESN'T STAY LONG. HE JUST TOLD POLICE THAT HE WAS SHOWING KENIA HIS LOFT. UM, I'M -- I'M GONNA GO. AND SHE LEFT A FEW MINUTES LATER. NOTHING HAPPENED, AND SHE LEFT THERE SAFELY. THERE'S ONE WAY TO FIND OUT IF CADE IS LYING. POLICE GO BACK TO THE VIDEO TO CHECK HIS STORY. HEY. HEY. THEY QUEUE UP THE VIDEO TO THE MOMENT SHE RE-ENTERS THE PICTURE BY THE ELEVATOR. A FEW MINUTES LATER, YOU SEE HER COME BACK DOWN AND LEAVE THAT AREA. OKAY, SO IT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S LEAVING THE BUILDING. YEAH, NOW SHE'S LEAVING THE BUILDING. KENIA STAGGERS OUT THE DOORWAY IN THE FRONT LOBBY, ALONE. SO WE KNEW NOTHING HAPPENED TO HER THERE. SHE WAS STILL ALIVE. SHE WAS STILL WELL AT THAT POINT. IT'S ANOTHER MAJOR SETBACK FOR INVESTIGATORS SEARCHING FOR KENIA MONGE. AND THEY KNOW THE HOPES OF FINDING HER ALIVE FADE WITH EACH PASSING HOUR. IT WAS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING, NOT KNOWING ANYTHING. YOU'RE KIND OF LOST. OKAY, WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SAID, "WE'VE DONE THIS. WE'VE DONE THIS. WE'VE DONE THIS. WE STILL HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING." BUT THE CAMERAS AT THE LOFT APARTMENTS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES THAT CAPTURED KENIA THAT NIGHT. THERE'S ANOTHER WITNESS THAT RECORDS A TELLTALE GLIMPSE OF THE MISSING WOMAN. IN TRUTH, SHE WAS JUST SORT OF A WALKING TARGET. IT'S BEEN SIX DAYS SINCE ANYONE HAS HEARD FROM 19-YEAR-OLD KENIA MONGE. SHE'S BEEN CAUGHT ON TAPE AT THE 24K BAR THE NIGHT SHE VANISHED. AND SHE'S SEEN AGAIN AT THE LOFT APARTMENTS, AT AROUND 2:00 A.M. NOW, POLICE ARE HOPING OTHER SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS MIGHT HELP THEM PICK UP HER TRAIL ONE MORE TIME. WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING. OKAY, LOOK, HERE ARE THE LOFTS. THEY CHECK CAMERA AFTER CAMERA AFTER CAMERA, LOOKING FOR ANY SIGN OF KENIA. BUT THERE'S NOTHING... ALL THAT TAPE... HAS TO BE THERE. SHE HAS TO HAVE GONE INTO THIS AREA. ...UNTIL THEY QUEUE UP THE CAMERA FROM A HOTEL JUST A BLOCK AWAY FROM THE APARTMENT WHERE SHE WAS LAST SEEN. THE CAMERA OVERLOOKS THE LOBBY. THEY SCROLL THROUGH, LOOKING FOR THE MISSING WOMAN. THEN, AT 2:04 A.M., THEY COME UPON THESE GHOST-LIKE FRAMES. THAT'S HER, FOR SURE. THEY STUDY EACH SECOND, EACH FRAME OF THE VIDEO. WE SEE HER WALKING ACROSS THE HOTEL LOBBY. SHE'S ALONE AND SEEMS OKAY. DOES SHE MEET SOMEONE AT THE HOTEL? FROM THE LOBBY LAYOUT, THEY DEDUCE SHE WAS THERE TO MAKE A RESTROOM STOP. SHE WENT TO THE BATHROOM THERE, WAS THERE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. POLICE KNOW SHE'S BEEN DRINKING AND MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF HER SURROUNDINGS. IS ANYONE FOLLOWING HER? BUT THE LOBBY SURVEILLANCE CAMERA IS WHERE THE TRAIL GOES COLD. THERE IS NO MORE VIDEO OF HER LEAVING. WHAT? JUST SEEMED LIKE IT WAS DEAD END AFTER DEAD END AFTER DEAD END. HOPE WAS ALL THAT KEPT EVERYONE TOGETHER. HOPE IS VERY POWERFUL, AND IT GETS YOU THROUGH. NOT YET. I KNOW THIS IS A TOUGH TIME ON YOU. I'M STILL CALLING THIS FRONT-DESK COP, YOU KNOW, ASKING HIM, "IS THERE ANYTHING? DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING?" THE POLICE TOLD US THEY DOING EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWERS TO FIND HER. I NEED MY DAUGHTER HOME. IN THE MOMENT, I WAS DESPERATE. WITH DETECTIVES OUT OF LEADS, TONY LEE LAUNCHES AN INVESTIGATION OF HIS OWN. HE STARTS WITH KENIA'S CELLPHONE. I WENT THROUGH HER PHONE MESSAGES. AND I'M LOOKING FOR WHO SHE WAS IN CONTACT THAT NIGHT. AND AS HE SEARCHES THE PHONE... AND THE MESSAGE SAYS, "HI, THIS IS TRAVIS." GUY IN THE CREEPY WHITE VAN ASKING, DID SHE GET HOME OKAY?" MARIA, COME LOOK AT THIS. FELT THAT, "OKAY, THIS SEEMS TO BE THE LAST PERSON THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITH THAT NIGHT." SO I IMMEDIATELY CALL. HELLO, IS THIS TRAVIS? TONY EXPLAINS KENIA IS MISSING. CONCERNED, TRAVIS IMMEDIATELY AGREES TO MEET WITH TONY AT THE GAS STATION WHERE HE LAST SAW KENIA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. THERE'S A WHITE VAN PARKED OUT IN THE BACK OF THIS CONOCO STATION. AND I GUESS THIS IS WHERE HE WANTED TO MEET ME. TRAVIS TELLS TONY THE STRANGE STORY OF HOW HE MET KENIA. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. HE SAID HE WAS HEADED HOME AROUND 2:00 A.M. WHEN HE SPOTTED HER. HE SAID THAT HE NOTICED, ON THE SIDEWALK, THIS YOUNG LADY -- BLACK DRESS, BLACK, SHORT, MINI SKIRT, RED HEELS. AND SHE WAS TALKING TO A HOMELESS GUY. AND HE THOUGHT THAT THIS DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT. SO HE DECIDED TO ASK HER, "HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?" LISTEN, I'M LOST. KENIA HAS LOST HER FRIENDS AND CELLPHONE. YEAH, NO PROBLEM. I NEED TO GO HOME. IF YOU CAN HELP ME, GIVE ME A LIFT? TRAVIS OFFERS TO HELP TRACK THEM DOWN. SORRY. IT'S A LITTLE MESSY. HE TOOK HER, DROVE HER AROUND, DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING. I REALLY NEED TO FIND MY FRIENDS AND MY PHONE. WHEN THEY FAIL TO FIND HER FRIENDS, HE OFFERS TO DRIVE HER HOME. BUT IF YOU WANT, I CAN JUST DROP YOU OFF AT YOUR... HE SAID, "WE HEADED OUT TO DOWNTOWN, GIVING HER A RIDE HOME. AS WE WERE ON OUR WAY, SHE SAID SHE WANTED A CIGARETTE." CIGARETTE, OKAY? TRAVIS THEN PULLS INTO THE GAS STATION SO KENYA CAN BUY CIGARETTES. AW, NO. BUT THE STORE IS CLOSED. IT'S CLOSED, HON. TRAVIS IS ABOUT TO PULL AWAY AND TAKE KENIA HOME... ACTUALLY, NO, THERE'S A GUY WITH A CIGARETTE. ...WHEN SHE SPOTS A GUY IN THE DISTANCE. JUST GIVE ME ONE SEC, OKAY? I'LL BE RIGHT HERE. KENIA HEADS OVER TO BUM A SMOKE FROM THE MAN. TRAVIS WAITS FOR HER TO RETURN SO HE CAN DRIVE HER HOME... HEY, ARE YOU COMING OR WHAT? OKAY. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. ...BUT SHE DOESN'T. THEY JUST TOOK OFF. AND HE SAID, "AND THAT'S THE LAST THAT I'VE SEEN OF HER." I REALLY SHOULD HAVE DROVE HER HOME, MAN. I'M SORRY. TONY IS DEVASTATED. HE WAS HOPING TRAVIS WOULD BE ABLE TO LEAD HIM TO KENIA. GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. YOU TAKE CARE, BROTHER. WHEN TONY TELLS DETECTIVES ABOUT WHAT TRAVIS FORBES TOLD HIM, THEY BRING THE GOOD SAMARITAN IN FOR AN INTERVIEW. DETECTIVE GURULE QUESTIONS TRAVIS ABOUT THE MYSTERY MAN. HE WENT BACK TO HIS GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE, KERRY HUMPHREY, AND THAT'S WHERE HE WAS. AND SHE VERIFIED HIS ALIBI. TRAVIS IS IN THE CLEAR... ...BUT HE HAS GIVEN DETECTIVES ANOTHER CLUE, ONE THAT LEAD THEM TO MORE CCTV OF KENIA AND THE STRANGER SHE LEFT WITH. FIRST QUESTION THE POLICE WERE ASKING IS, "IS THERE ANY KIND OF RECORDED EVIDENCE, ANY KIND OF SECURITY VIDEO AT THE GAS STATION?" DETECTIVES APPROACH THE MANAGER EXPECTING TO WALK AWAY WITH FOOTAGE AND HOPEFULLY GET ONE STEP CLOSER TO TRACKING DOWN KENIA. DO YOU HAVE ANY CAMERAS AROUND HERE? IT TURNS OUT THERE WAS NO SECURITY CAMERA AT THE GAS STATION. TAKE CARE. BYE. THE GAS STATION LEAD THAT SOUNDED SO PROMISING TURNS OUT TO BE JUST ANOTHER DEAD END. AT THIS POINT, THERE'S NOT REALLY MUCH WE CAN DO BUT JUST KIND OF, LIKE... A MIRACLE WILL HAPPEN. JUST KNOW THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER. WE JUST LEFT THE DOORS OPEN FOR HER, JUST HOPING THAT SHE WOULD JUST COME BACK HOME. I KNOW. I KNOW. WITH THE POLICE INVESTIGATION STALLED, JOURNALISTS KEEP THE CASE OF THE MISSING STUDENT IN THE PUBLIC EYE. THE LEES ARE LIVING EVERY PARENT'S NIGHTMARE. KENIA MONGE WENT MISSING SIX WEEKS AGO. WE KNOW SOMEBODY IS KEEPING HER FROM CONTACTING US. I FELT LIKE EVERY TIME WE DID A STORY, WE WERE HELPING KEEP KENIA'S NAME OUT THERE... WE GOT JUST ONE QUESTION -- WHERE IS KENIA? ...AND THAT'S WHAT THE FAMILY WANTED. THEY JUST FELT LIKE THE MORE EYES THAT SAW THIS, THE MORE CHANCES THEY HAD OF SOLVING THE MYSTERY OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. POLICE SAY THEY'VE ALREADY FOLLOWED UP ON SEVERAL LEADS. ALL THOSE NEWS STORIES ABOUT THE MISSING WOMAN BRING IN A FLOOD OF TIPS, INCLUDING ONE TIP THAT GIVES POLICE A MUCH-NEEDED BREAK. AN OWNER OF A LOCAL BAKERY HANDS OVER A DRIVE LOADED WITH FIVE DAYS OF SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE. OKAY, LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT US HERE. SHE THINKS THERE'S SOMETHING AND SOMEONE ON THE VIDEO CONNECTED TO THE CASE. THIS VIDEO WILL SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF WHAT HAPPENED TO KENIA MONGE. THE SEARCH FOR KENIA MONGE HAS LED TO ONE DEAD END AFTER ANOTHER... UNTIL NOW. LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT US HERE. DETECTIVE ASTRADA HAS ACCESS TO A HARD DRIVE FROM A BAKERY. IT CONTAINS VIDEO CAPTURED FROM THE BAKERY OWNER'S OFFICE ON THE DAY KENIA WENT MISSING. WHEN THEY QUEUE IT UP, THEY'RE SHOCKED TO SEE A FAMILIAR FACE. TRAVIS FORBES. IS THAT TRAVIS? YES, TRAVIS FORBES. TRAVIS RUNS A GRANOLA BAR BUSINESS FROM THIS BAKERY. NOTHING SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THAT... ...UNTIL ASTRADA SEES WHAT HE DOES NEXT. TRAVIS WALKS INTO AN OFFICE. A FEW SECONDS LATER, THE CAMERA SHUTS DOWN. POLICE KNOW YOU CUT THE CAMERA WHEN YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE. WHEN THE TAPE COMES BACK ON, THEY SPOT SOMETHING OMINOUS. WHY IS HE WEARING BIG, YELLOW GLOVES? IT WASN'T THE KIND OF GLOVES YOU WEAR FOR BAKING GRANOLA BARS. IT WAS THE KIND OF GLOVES YOU WOULD WEAR WHEN YOU'RE CLEANING SOMETHING UP. COULD THIS BE A CRIME SCENE CLEAN-UP? WHEN THEY CUT TO THE CAMERA FROM THE STORE ROOM, WHAT THEY SEE CHILLS THIS VETERAN DETECTIVE TO THE BONE. TRAVIS IS SEEN WHEELING A LARGE CONTAINER THAT HE USES FOR HIS GRANOLA BARS INTO A FREEZER. THE PROBLEM IS, GRANOLA BARS AREN'T FROZEN. SO WHAT'S IN THAT COOLER? WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S SEALED WITH DUCT TAPE. AND THE BOX IS BIG -- JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR A PETITE BODY, LIKE KENIA'S. WELL, I DID THINK RIGHT AWAY, "THERE IT IS." ...A COOLER LIKE THAT 5:00 IN THE MORNING AND PUT IT IN THE FREEZER? "KENIA'S BODY IS IN THAT COOLER." SHE WAS TINY, AND THIS WAS A BIG COOLER. IT WAS JUST NAUSEATING, REALLY. PUT IT IN THE FREEZER. THAT IS THE EVIDENCE THE POLICE NEED TO PURSUE THIS GUY. COULD CAMERAS HAVE CAUGHT TRAVIS CUTTING OFF SURVEILLANCE, CLEANING UP EVIDENCE, AND THEN CONCEALING A BODY? DENVER POLICE DETECTIVES CATCH UP WITH THEIR MAN 65 MILES NORTH OF THE CITY IN THE COLLEGE TOWN OF FORT COLLINS. HE'S ALREADY ADMITTED HE WAS WITH KENIA THE NIGHT SHE VANISHED, AND NOW HE'S CAUGHT ON TAPE. TRAVIS FOLDS. FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE CRIME, TRAVIS FORBES ADMITS HE KILLED KENIA MONGE. TRAVIS AGREES TO SHOW DETECTIVES WHERE HE BURIED KENIA. AND POLICE CAPTURE IT ON TAPE. HE STEPPED OUT OF THE TRUCK AND HE LET OUT THIS, LIKE, WAIL, THIS JUST BLOOD-CURDLING WAIL... ...AND I THOUGHT, "THIS IS WHERE SHE IS." I RECEIVED THAT PHONE CALL FROM THE D.A.'S OFFICE. I KNEW IT AT THAT MOMENT THAT THEY HAD PROBABLY FOUND KENIA. I TOLD MARIA. AND THE FIRST THING SHE ASKED ME WAS, "IS SHE OKAY?" AND I TOLD HER, "NO." AND I TOLD HER KENIA WAS GONE. "WE'VE LOST HER." AND I JUST SAID, "GOD, PLEASE GIVE ME STRENGTH." DAD? COME HERE. I JUST FELT LIKE EVERYTHING THAT I WAS HOPING FOR JUST GOT TAKEN AWAY FROM ME. AND I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY TOOK MY SISTER. SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GONE. SHE WAS CRYING. TRAVIS HAS TOLD POLICE THE WHOLE STORY. UM, YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT? IN THE EARLY HOURS OF FRIDAY, APRIL 1st, HE PICKS UP AN INTOXICATED KENIA MONGE. SORRY. IT'S A LITTLE MESSY. OFFERED TO GIVE HER A RIDE. OFFERED TO HELP HER. YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA HELP ME. HE DROVE HER TO A PARK NEAR THAT GAS STATION. SHE WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND STARTED FIGHTING HIM. THEN HE STARTED THINKING, "WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS BODY?" AND IT WAS ALL CAUGHT ON TAPE. THERE WERE 86 SEPARATE PIECES OF VIDEO OF EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAD. I LOOKED AT EACH ONE OF THEM INDIVIDUALLY. SURVEILLANCE VIDEO TURNED OUT TO BE THE ABSOLUTE KEY IN THIS CASE. TRAVIS FORBES IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON AFTER PLEADING GUILTY TO FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. ALL AROUND YOU, LIFE GOES ON. AND IF YOU DON'T GET BACK OUT THERE AND LIVE, IT WILL PARALYZE YOU. IT WILL KILL YOU. YOU CAN DIE OF HEARTACHE. IT'S SO HARD TO GO DAY BY DAY WITHOUT HER. TO ME, IT'S A NIGHTMARE. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CLOSURE. AND THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS "TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS." IF THERE IS A SUCH THING, WE AIN'T THERE YET.
