 There is a small cave. There you will find a box for my children. Bury the books. And for 12 summers, we will not speak a word of this. Twelve years, you have kept a secret. Could you keep another? They are books from your true father. You opened the box. Maghra will burn the books. So do not tell her. The books will give them knowledge. It was Baba Voss who condemned my mother, your own sister, to the bonfire. I'm gonna send news of a witch. A message. Who knows who will find it? Chet-chet! Chet-chet-chet! Still recognize your melody...

 the way your right is heavier than your left. But now you shift uneasily from foot to foot. You never used to. You were solid. Life, experience... they rock me from side to side. Welcome home, Tamacti Jun. Majesty. My tour of duty is done. My commission was for 20 summers. And those summers have turned to winter. You brought taxes and tribute? Yes. The axles groaned through the mountains. A hundred carts, God bone, grain,

 diamond for axes, axes for wood, slaves. You're a fine tax collector. But you're not a finder of witches. In every village, I interrogated, presagers would say, "Jerlamarel. No, no, sir. I don't know that name." I burned all who lied to me. You spread his name. In order to find him. You were a prophet for him? Gathering people, telling them about his power, giving them his name, scattering his seeds? As your Witchfinder general, I have come to report that I have failed my queen... and I accept the natural consequence. But I ask only this instead of execution on the altar... you allow me to take my own life... in the manner of a warrior. Your Majesty, the people are rejoicing. The elders are dividing the spoils. The warehouses are being filled. A market for the slaves is put into ropes. Our most exalted general has returned. Tamacti Jun? Yes. It is I, Tamacti Jun... who have returned with a hundred carts when it should've been a hundred and one. Your Majesty, his failure to find one man, one heretic, must be balanced against this sound of hundreds calling his name. Lord Dune, go to the high altar. Tell the people to gather. I'll speak to them. I, too, will rejoice. Tamacti Jun. Yes. In recognition of 20 years' loyal service... you have my permission... to take your own life. Farewell. Lord Dune, why are you still here? You could have ordered him to live. Tamacti Jun understands the nature of his failure better than you. Outside, they're celebrating their own doom. One man lost. No! Our power lost! Jerlamarel's a god striding across the world, making more gods, who will make more gods! Tamacti Jun knows what is lost. Go. Tamacti Jun! Tamacti Jun! Come, come. He's over there, under the tree. Who's where, under what tree? Turkeys. So, you go around and drive them towards me. Ready? Hush, Daddy. Feel. I made something. From the books, for hunting. Listen. And learn. -I got it. Come. -What? I read in one of the books from the box something very interesting about the people who used to live in America. What is America? This is just the beginning, Daddy. I've read so much. With the right machines and enough power, we could make weapons much more powerful than what I just used, to kill a hundred in one hour. Or they had these bombs Things called "bombs" that could blow up whole cities. Half your words are book words to me, love, and they mean nothing to me. Well, what about this turkey? Turkey means dinner. Every day I could go out. I could get deer, even. Just like Jerlamarel. You say deer. And how exactly would I explain that to your mother? That is exactly what Kofun says. Everything we learn, he wants to hide. You know I enjoy a tasty deer. I don't even like turkey. -Makes me sleepy. -I know, Papa. What are you doing? I could kill any one of them at any time... and they wouldn't even know what it was. They'd say it is the God Flame's vengeance. Even though we know the God Flame is a bunch of gas 93 million miles away... -burning in outer -Stop! He didn't leave us books so that we can make weapons. How do you know? Why did he leave us books? What was his reason? Explain, Professor. Stop. Do you think about it? Think about what? What it'll be like when we meet him. If we meet him. This will guide us. It's a picture of the world. Look, I've already worked out where we are. See, our river flows to this bigger river called Mississippi. And then... this was once a city called Pittsburgh. -Pittsburgh. -I think it was Industrial town known for the production of steel manufactured goods. Goddens' History of America. Our father left us with the knowledge and wisdom from all ages of humanity, and yet, somehow, Kofun, you make it boring. "Boring" is bows and arrows. "Boring" is reading and not doing. -Chet-chet! -Chet-chet-chet! Last night, a baby was born... to Souter Bax. But the baby was not whole. The baby was not formed human. Because you witches cursed me! You should burn them... not follow them. What came from her was... a devil. And it's their fault. The baby was not born that way because of any curse. God Flame, welcome her. It was born that way for want of fresh blood. When so few are together for so long, the blood of the tribe thickens. We have known through the generations that without new blood, the monsters would come. -Simple genetics. DNA clusters -Hush, Haniwa. This baby is a warning to us. And we should heed that warning. We need to share ourselves and be shared. No. We must go out again and join the festival, dance away the monsters. We have avoided the festivals for a reason. Out in the world, we are hunted. Here, we are safe. Perhaps here, we might be a little smarter about choosing partners. The need is deep, Baba Voss. New blood is needed here, and has for a long time. I said, no. These people have been held here for so long. Held here? Held here? They have been protected here. The one does not out-rule the other, especially since so many of them dispute whether we are here to protect them from the Witchfinder, or to protect your children from them. They have done without medicine while sick. They have done without trade while wanting. They have done without. And if you forbid them from travel... they will start leaving on their own. Our people wandering the countryside on their own. They'll lead the Witchfinder to us in no time. Then maybe it's better we have some control over where they wander and who they come in contact with. What do you propose, my love? I know the way to a festival. They have some medicine, goods, and new blood. The only way to protect Haniwa and Kofun is to make sure that this place is secure. And if that means we have to control where the Alkenny goes... then that's what we'll do. I'll be told when it's done? Yes, Your Majesty. It is done? News from the Sun Grave, Your Majesty. News? Great God Flame, accept my spark into your flame and let it rise to meet you. It's not over. It's not over. We'll be gone for a week. The festival's a few days' walk. Antia is going, and she's younger than us. Haniwa, I am not risking anyone finding out about your gift. We've kept our secret safe here for 17 summers. Well, not without suspicion. We're better at keeping secrets than you know, Mama. Meaning what? You are not old enough to share or spread your seeds. We don't want to share disgusting seeds. Well, then you should be happy to stay. Why would someone like me want the seed of a blind man? Come here. I said, come here. Why would you speak this way? I don't know. I'm sorry. Because I love you all... and you all love me, I ignore certain voices in my head... because I know you would not lie to me. By accident of birth, you were given the ability to see. Do not think you are superior because others cannot. And keep your book words to yourself, because sometimes those words are wicked. Mama, these flowers will rot before I even get there. These flowers are for you, to smell along the way, to find the feeling to enter into the dance. Who says I'll dance? It's long past time, Bow. Your father and I danced. Form up. -Baba? -Love. Remember, Alkenny, let us be known as "the people of the waterfall." Let us not speak of the past. Travel well. Hey. Haniwa. Slow down! We're upwind. They can't hear us. I'd like to keep it that way. Happy? Kofun. We're going to see the world. What is that? Maybe this is one of those places the spaceship took off and went to the moon. Look. Look at that wheel. I don't remember reading about cars that size. Come on, before it gets too dark. Fresh wool. Fine, like silk. Mesh to mend your clothes. I am the priest of the God Flame, brother of the fire, who shapes me like God bone. Executor of God's will. We have built this temple of flame. We have brought witches to burn. All have been convicted of having the power of light. A Witchfinder is here. Behold No. This is something different. ...as we turn the witches of light into heat. Please. They can't even see. Look at their eyes. They're being burned for nothing. -Stop! -Please. You're wrong! They can't even The Witchfinder has missed us, but his message has traveled. Made disciples. The children will never be safe. The children will be safe at home. Everyone thinks home is safe... until it isn't. Help! Haniwa! Strong. Young. Healthy... For once, these sheep are not held behind their fences. Fethin? Fethin! Fethin! Slavers! Slavers! What is it? There's Slavers! They took my Fethin! They took my little girl! Fethin! Fethin! They were Slavers! Mama. Mama, Papa, wake up. It's me. What are you doing here? Mama, I think something bad has Where's Kofun? Where's Kofun? I think he's... I think he's been taken. By whom? I think he's been taken by Slavers. What do you think you're doing? Why have we stopped? The boy thought he'd take a break. -Something's wrong with him. -I'll find out. No. I will. You scream, I will gut you. Can't you hear her? She's hurt. She keeps tripping, so I'm tripping. So, don't trip. No, please! She's bleeding. How do you know? I'm a Scentier. I can smell the blood. And she's limping. It is not her foot my customers are interested in. A bit of spirit. This one will get a good price. Move! There! I see smoke. They follow the Sage Road. They will stray from it. For you, but not for me. They will leave a trail. I will see it. -I will gather warriors. We pursue! -There's no time. Few men will come. I need them back. Haniwa, lead the way. Hemlock. It's theirs. You certain? Absolutely. Mama? Papa? There's a message here. Kofun left a message. What message? How could he leave a message? You're just going to have to trust me. Trust you? What message? Kofun has written a message, and I can read it. No. How do you know those words? How do you know "written" and "read"? It's knowledge from the box, Mama. We opened it. We have learned to read and write. And we read all the books he left behind. Who opened it? I did. What does the message say? -Mama, I -My son is missing! I want him back! So, what does it say? Guards! Sit! What's your name? Kofun. My name is Fethin. Did you really think telling the Slavers I was hurt would make them help me? Okay, you're welcome. No, I didn't mean it like that. Thank you. Careful. Many rocks. Many rocks. Mama. I'm good. Yes. I see ahead, smoke coming from inside a structure. -Are the towers made of God bone? -Yes. It's where they hold the slaves before they sell them. If I don't get to him now, he'll be sold to the market. How do you know, Papa? I know this place... because my father was a Slaver... and his father before him. And for a time, so was I. It's not as you think, Haniwa. Your father was different. Do not tell her that. It isn't true. I was raised to chain and whip and beat and sell innocent people. He taught me how to torture. But I've buried that part of me, that man... deep down in a hole. But now I must do something I swore I would never do. What? Wake him up. -Papa, I can go with you. I have my bow. -No. No, my love. You must not see what I'll become. I will get Kofun back. I will get mighty God bone for you. Mighty God bone. Chet-chet! What was that? Close your eyes. Wech. The great Baba Voss. The great coward. The great... deserter. Finally, my day has come. And I will have your head. Upokokohua. Haere Mai! Pick it up. Papa, watch out! Your boy! No... Papa. It's me. Mama, it's me. Mama, it's all right. -Kofun? -It's all right. Kofun. Mama, it's all right. It's all right. Haniwa. Haniwa. I'm here, Mama. We're all here. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. -I'm sorry about the box. -It's okay. I'm sorry. Mama? -Mag -No. Mama! No. Mama? All we have learned from our books, and all we have learned from the festival... all we have learned in 17 summers... None of it makes me wanna leave here. And Haniwa? What of you? A man is dead. A bad man... but still, he's dead. I killed him because I knew I had the power to kill him and not be caught. All that I've learned... all that I've read... all of it... all of it makes me want to leave here. But, Mama... I'm scared of... what I am and what I can do. And I just want you to know that I love you, Mama. And I love you, Papa. And one day, my big mouth might get me burned. No. I already know. I know. I know you. My babies... Because I knew him. And it's time I told you about him. Jerlamarel. It's time for the truth... for all of us. He was a good man. But sometimes power can consume goodness. I'll tell you about him. Baba, go and get Paris.
