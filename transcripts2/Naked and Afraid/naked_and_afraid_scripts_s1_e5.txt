 THEIR CHALLENGE IS TO SURVIVE FOR 21 DAYS... GOD. WE ARE SO SCREWED. ...KNOWING THAT THE HUMAN BODY CAN ONLY LIVE THREE DAYS WITHOUT WATER... WE NEED WATER, FAST. ...AND BEGINS TO SHUT DOWN AFTER THREE WEEKS WITHOUT FOOD. THIS IS THE EVEREST OF SURVIVAL CHALLENGES. CAN A MAN AND WOMAN SURVIVE ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS NAKED AND AFRAID? Julie: IT'S NOT SAFE RIGHT NOW. THIS IS DANGEROUS. Narrator: BORNEO, THIRD LARGEST ISLAND IN THE WORLD, PART OF THE MALAYSIAN ARCHIPELAGO. IT IS A MOUNTAINOUS, RUGGED COUNTRY, COVERED IN DENSE, DANGEROUS JUNGLE.

 KNOWN FOR ITS FREQUENT TROPICAL STORMS, EVERY YEAR, RAINFALL CAN EXCEED 13 FEET, CAUSING DESTRUCTIVE FLASH FLOODING. ONE OF THE OLDEST RAINFORESTS IN THE WORLD, ITS BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE CONCEALS ITS DEADLY ANIMALS. VENOMOUS SNAKES AND POISONOUS SPIDERS LIE IN WAIT ON THE FOREST FLOOR. AGGRESSIVE WILD BOAR AND BLOODSUCKING LEECHES ARE A CONSTANT THREAT. Julie: I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO A RAINFOREST, AND THIS IS MY FIRST TIME TESTING MY SKILLS IN THIS EXTREME SITUATION. I'M JULIE. I'M 6'4", STRONG-WILLED, AND TOWER OVER MOST PEOPLE. BUT MY HEIGHT CAN SOMETIMES INTIMIDATE MEN. I'VE BEEN TEACHING SURVIVAL SKILLS FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, AND MY SPECIALTIES ARE WILDLIFE TRACKING... WE'VE GOT HERON TRACKS RIGHT HERE. ...BUILDING SHELTERS, BUILDING FIRE PRIMITIVELY. SO, KNOWING THAT, I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SURVIVE. I MIGHT HAVE TO SHOW HER WHAT I KNOW ABOUT BEING NUDE. MY NAME IS PUMA, AND MY SURVIVAL CREDENTIALS ARE MORE OF A LIFE EXPERIENCE. ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO, I WAS IN THE BACKCOUNTRY SNOWBOARDING WITH A FRIEND OF MINE, AND WE WERE TRAPPED FOR ABOUT SEVEN DAYS AND RAN OUT OF FOOD. AND THAT JUST TAUGHT ME THAT I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE SKILLS I NEEDED TO PLAY THAT HARD, SO IT'S BEEN A LIFE-STUDY EVER SINCE. I CAN PRETTY WELL TAKE CARE OF MYSELF IN ALMOST ANY SITUATION WELL ENOUGH TO TAKE THIS CHANCE. I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THE JUNGLE, SO I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SURVIVE. I'M A BIT OF A BADASS, I GUESS. IT'S LIKE THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE, BEING NAKED AND SURVIVING IN THE WILD. I DON'T HAVE ANY PROTECTION AGAINST RATTAN VINES OR LEECHES. AND IN SURVIVAL, YOU NEED TO WALK AROUND A LOT TO GATHER MATERIALS, SO THAT'S DEFINITELY GONNA BE A CHALLENGE. Puma: HOW DO I FEEL ABOUT MY PARTNER BEING NUDE? I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. [ CHUCKLES ] IF THERE'S A HOLE IN MY CONFIDENCE MEETING MY PARTNER, IT WOULD BE SHE'S GOT TO KNOW HOW TO ADAPT. PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ANY PLAN B, AND THAT'S JUST DANGEROUS IN THESE SITUATIONS. Julie: I CAN'T WAIT TO ACTUALLY GET TO MEET THIS GUY. HOPEFULLY HE'S TALL. HOPEFULLY HE KNOWS HOW TO HUNT AND TRAP. Puma: A LOT OF THE TIME THAT I'VE SPENT IN THE BACKCOUNTRY, IT'S DANGEROUS AND YOU DON'T GO OUT WITH ANYBODY YOU CAN'T FULLY TRUST. WITHOUT KNOWING WHO THIS IS, IT'S GONNA BE HARD. Julie: THERE'S A NAKED MAN IN FRONT OF ME, A PRETTY ATTRACTIVE GUY. HI. HI. MY NAME'S JULIE. PUMA. HI, PUMA. I LIKE HIS HAIR, AND I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF NERVOUS. YEAH. [ BOTH LAUGH ] IT'S KIND OF LIKE, "AAH!" I'M NAKED. I'M A BIT OF A MOUNTAIN MAN. RIGHT ON. ME, TOO. I MEAN, I'M NOT A MOUNTAIN MAN. [ LAUGHS ] Puma: SHE'S A VERY TALL WOMAN. AND AS YOU GET BIGGER, THE MORE RESOURCES YOU USE. SO MY INSTANT FEELING WAS A BIT OF CONCERN, BUT I COULD CURL UP INTO HER SPOON, NO PROBLEM, YOU KNOW? I WOULDN'T EVEN NEED A SHELTER. Puma: SHOULD WE FIND SOME SHADE AND MAYBE POWWOW AND DECIDE WHAT OUR PLAN OF ATTACK MIGHT BE? YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD. Narrator: JULIE AND PUMA ARE ALLOWED TO BRING ONE ESSENTIAL SURVIVAL ITEM EACH. A MACHETE. SWEET. THIS IS MY COOKING POT. A SMALL CREW WILL CAPTURE THE 21-DAY JOURNEY WITH CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS NOT TO INTERVENE UNLESS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. IN ADDITION, JULIE AND PUMA ARE PROVIDED WITH HAND-HELD CAMERAS TO RECORD THEIR EXPERIENCE. WHAT'S UP? HELLO. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. [ CHUCKLES ] LET'S GET THE MAP OUT. A PRIMITIVE MAP OF THE AREA HAS BEEN GIVEN TO JULIA AND PUMA. INDICATED ON IT IS THEIR EXTRACTION POINT, FOUR MILES SOUTHWEST DOWN THE RIVER, WHERE THEY'LL NEED TO BE 21 DAYS FROM NOW. THE MAP HIGHLIGHTS A LOCATION OF A STREAM AND CLEARING WHERE THEY CAN SET UP SHELTER. THEY MUST NAVIGATE THROUGH THE TREACHEROUS TERRAIN BEFORE NIGHTFALL. WE ARE HERE, AND NORTH IS BEHIND US. SO, WHICH WAY ARE WE GONNA GO? THAT WAY? YEAH. OKAY. CAN'T WAIT TO FIND SOME WATER. YEAH, OBVIOUSLY THAT'S CHORE NUMBER ONE -- HYDRATION. I'M STILL, LIKE, I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THIS GUY IS. LIKE, WHO IS THIS DUDE? IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, YOUR PARTNER IS YOUR LIFELINE. THIS STRANGER HAS MY LIFE IN HIS HANDS AND VICE VERSA. THERE WAS A SLIGHT CONCERN, BUT I JUST HOPE SHE'S STRONG WHERE I'M WEAK, YOU KNOW, NO MATTER WHAT THE JUNGLE THROWS AT US. WOW. THIS IS JUST, LIKE, STRAIGHT DOWN. TAKE YOUR TIME. [ CHUCKLES ] OKAY. Narrator: AS PART OF THEIR SELECTION PROCESS, PUMA AND JULIE HAVE UNDERGONE RIGOROUS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING. THEIR OVERALL SURVIVAL ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN EVALUATED BY EXPERTS ACCORDING TO THREE CATEGORIES -- SKILL, EXPERIENCE, MENTAL. PUMA HAS TESTED HIS SURVIVAL SKILLS IN MANY EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS, BUT HIS MAVERICK NATURE COULD TEMPT HIM TO FLOUT THE BASIC RULES OF SURVIVAL. JULIE'S EXPERIENCE AS A SURVIVAL TEACHER SCORES HER HIGHLY, BUT HER LACK OF REAL-WORLD EXPERIENCE COULD COUNT AGAINST HER. JULIE AND PUMA HAVE BEEN GIVEN OVERALL SURVIVAL RATINGS, OR PSR. PUMA'S SURVIVAL RATING IS SET AT 7.1. JULIE IS SET AT 5.5. OUR EXPERTS WILL REASSESS THEIR SURVIVAL RATING AT THE END OF THEIR 21-DAY CHALLENGE. WATCH THIS EDGE HERE. IT'S ALL ERODED. WHOA! [ LAUGHS ] Julie: OH, MY GOD. THIS IS INSANE. WE JUST STARTED, AND I ALREADY FEEL LIKE I'M ABOUT TO FALL TO MY DEATH. GOT YOU. Puma: COMING DOWN THAT FACE BAREFOOT IN THE MUD, IT SPELLS DISASTER. AND TRYING TO RELY ON PLANT LIFE AS YOUR LIFELINE, IT'S NOT EASY. THE SOIL'S SOFT AND THAT STUFF CAN PULL OUT, AND IT WAS STEEP ENOUGH TO WHERE ONCE YOU STARTED TUMBLING, IT WOULD TAKE A WHILE TO STOP. AND THAT'S MECHANICAL INJURY, AND THAT'S THE END OF YOUR DAY. HOW ABOUT THIS? HOLD THIS AND I'LL HOLD THE END AND I'LL GIVE YOU TENSION ON YOUR WAY OVER. GOOD EYE ON THAT, BY THE WAY. THANKS. I JUST FOUND THE GAME TRAIL. THE TIPS OF THE TRACK ARE ROUNDED, SO THAT WOULD MEAN IT'S NOT REALLY A DEER. SO THIS IS A BOAR TRACK, AND A BOAR PROBABLY KNOWS OUR PATTERNS BETTER THAN WE DO BECAUSE THEY'RE PROBABLY WATCHING EVERYTHING. SO, IT'S DEFINITELY A CONCERN. THOSE THINGS CAN GET KIND OF NASTY. WE SHOULD PROBABLY KEEP MOVING. YEAH. THAT'S A MEAL. GET THAT. [ CHUCKLES ] QUICK. Julie: ALL RIGHT. NEVER MIND. REALLY FEELING REALLY DEHYDRATED. I THINK I NEED SOME WATER. HOW MUCH FURTHER IS IT? Puma: I'M CONCERNED MORE, I THINK, FOR JULIE THAN I AM FOR MYSELF AT THIS POINT. SHE WAS TALKING ALREADY THAT SHE WAS THIRSTY AND I WASN'T FEELING IT YET, SO I'M ACTUALLY A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT HER STAMINA. Puma: OH, WOW. THAT'S SWEET. I BET YOU THAT'S A BIG TREE THAT'S ON THE MAP. HOW FAR AWAY IS IT FROM OUR SPOT? LET'S GET THE MAP OUT AND SEE. WE STARTED HERE. WE'RE PROBABLY IN HERE SOMEWHERE. I'D LIKE TO GET OUT HERE. WE NEED WATER, SO IF WE'RE GONNA GET HERE BEFORE NIGHTFALL, WE GOT TO PUT A MOVE ON. WE'VE COME ABOUT HALFWAY. LET'S MOVE WITH A PURPOSE. Julie: I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS HIKE IS TAKING TOO LONG 'CAUSE WE'RE BURNING DAYLIGHT AND WE JUST NEED TO FOCUS ON GETTING SHELTER BEFORE IT GETS DARK. WOW, LOOK AT THAT. WATER. HEY. OH, WOW. ALL RIGHT. IS THAT THE SPOT? BEAUTIFUL. [ CHUCKLES ] WHOA. WATER. WATER. CHECK THAT OFF THE LIST. OH, YEAH. OH, IT'S SO NICE. I JUST WANT TO GET IN THAT. YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF DAYLIGHT. WE NEED THE FIRE TO MAKE THIS WATER DRINKABLE. SHOULD WE MAYBE TRY TO FOCUS ON THAT OR SHOULD WE GO FOR SHELTER FIRST? YEAH, I MEAN, THERE'S SOME CREEPY-CRAWLIES OUT THERE LIKE VIPERS AND SCORPIONS. I THINK GETTING OFF THE GROUND IS GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT. OKAY, YEAH. Narrator: WITH SO MUCH UNKNOWN ABOUT THEIR ENVIRONMENT, JULIE AND PUMA'S DECISION TO GO FOR SHELTER AND NOT FIRE IS A CRUCIAL ONE. Julie: I'M STRESSING BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THE ENVIRONMENT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CREEPY-CRAWLIES ARE LIKE. WE JUST KNOW THAT THEY'RE MORE ACTIVE AT NIGHT, AND AT NIGHT, WE CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. IT GETS PITCH BLACK. IT'S NOT SAFE TO BE ON THE GROUND. Narrator: JULIE AND PUMA ARE BUILDING A HIGH PLATFORM SHELTER USING THICK TREE TRUNKS FOR THEIR FOUNDATION AND SMALLER BRANCHES AS SUPPORT BEAMS. THE MATERIALS ARE LASHED TOGETHER WITH VINES. AND ONCE COMPLETE, THE SHELTER WILL KEEP THEM UP OFF THE GROUND AND AWAY FROM DANGEROUS PREDATORS. WE DIDN'T LEAVE OURSELVES A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TO DO THIS, YOU KNOW? YOU NEED A GOOD THREE, FOUR HOURS FOR ANY KIND OF SHELTER EVEN IN THE BEST CONDITIONS. AND WITH THE DAYLIGHT DIMINISHING, THIS HAS BEEN A MAJOR CONCERN OF MINE THE WHOLE TIME. I DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES HERE TO DO THIS IN THE TIME ALLOWED. WELL... SO FAR, SO GOOD? SO FAR, SO GOOD. IT'S THE END OF DAY ONE. WE SPENT MOST OF IT TRAVELING, BUT WE GOT OURSELVES UP OFF THE GROUND SO FAR, AND THAT'S ONE SUCCESS. Puma: WISH WE HAD TIME TO GET A FIRE GOING TO BOIL WATER AND HAVE PROTECTION FROM ANIMALS, BUT I GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT TILL TOMORROW FOR THAT ONE. [ INSECTS CHIRPING ] SO, YOU KNOW, THERE'S JURASSIC BUGS THAT KEEP -- BDDDR! -- HUMMING BY MY HEAD HERE. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING, SO IT'S JUST -- THIS IS NO JOKE. THIS IS THE JUNGLE. AND I'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE, SO I'M ON HIGH ALERT. Julie: I AM SO READY TO SLEEP. I FEEL LIKE I COULD SLEEP ALL NIGHT AND THEN SOME. [ RUSTLING ] HELLO? SOMETHING MOVING AROUND DOWN THERE. I'M GONNA CHECK IT OUT. [ ANIMAL GRUNTING ] I'M ALREADY CHILLED TO THE BONE. THAT TREE UP THERE LOOKS REALLY CONCERNING. HIT THE GROUND LIKE A SPEAR. I CAN HEAR SOMETHING MOVING AROUND DOWN THERE. Narrator: JULIE AND PUMA HAVE TREKKED ALL DAY THROUGH THE TREACHEROUS RAINFOREST OF BORNEO, FINALLY REACHING A CLEARING THEY'LL CALL HOME FOR THE NEXT 21 DAYS. Julie: I'M STRESSING BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE A FEW HOURS OF DAYLIGHT, AND I KNOW THAT WE NEED TO GET OFF THE GROUND. Narrator: WITH DANGEROUS, NOCTURNAL PREDATORS IN THE AREA, JULIE AND PUMA FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY. THEY PRIORITIZED SHELTER BEFORE FIRE. THEY RACED TO BUILD A STRONG PLATFORM SHELTER HIGH ABOVE THE JUNGLE FLOOR BEFORE THE NIGHT FELL. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, THEY ARE STARTLED AWAKE. HELLO? I'M GONNA CHECK IT OUT. [ ANIMAL GRUNTING ] ALL RIGHT. Julie: THAT'S GOOD. I'M GONNA CHECK IT OUT. Narrator: WILD BOARS ARE GENERALLY NOCTURNAL, AND THEY ARE KNOWN TO BE AGGRESSIVE WHEN THREATENED. THEY ARE POWERFUL CREATURES, ARMED WITH SHARP TUSKS UP TO FOUR INCHES LONG THAT CAN EASILY PENETRATE FLESH. Julie: THIS IS STUPID. IT'S NOT SAFE RIGHT NOW. THIS IS DANGEROUS. [ SNORTING CONTINUES ] Puma: RUN. RUN! Julie: Shh! HEY! HAH! GET! SCAT! SCAT! GET OUT OF HERE! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. OKAY, LET'S GO. UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK I JUST SAW A WILD BOAR. THAT WAS TERRIFYING. UH, WE'RE JUST RECORDING OUR PLAN, WHICH IS TO GET A FIRE, BOIL SOME WATER. THERE COULD BE PATHOGENS IN THE WATER THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM. IT BEING DAY TWO, IF WE DON'T GET WATER TODAY, IT WOULDN'T SEEM LIKE IT, BUT YOU START TO GO DOWNHILL PRETTY QUICK. WITH A SPINDLE, YOU WANT IT KIND OF SHARP AT THE TOP AND BLUNT AT THE BOTTOM SO THERE'S LESS FRICTION UP HERE AND MAXIMUM FRICTION DOWN HERE. Julie: WHILE PUMA'S MAKING A FIRE AND SINCE WE RAN OUT OF DAYLIGHT YESTERDAY, MY PRIORITY IS TO FOCUS ON THE SHELTER. WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO SLEEP HERE ANOTHER NIGHT AS-IS. SO THE PLAN IS TO MAKE IT MORE COMFORTABLE AND TO STRENGTHEN THE SUPPORT SO IT CAN KEEP US UP ABOVE THE LEECHES, PIT VIPERS, AND THOSE WILD BOARS. Puma: EVERYTHING'S WET AND ROTTEN. SPINDLE'S REALLY PUNKY. IT'S LIKE A SPONGE. SON OF A *BLEEP* [ CHUCKLES ] OH. Julie: I DON'T KNOW WHAT PUMA'S DOING, BUT I DON'T WANT TO STEP ON HIS TOES, SO I'M JUST GONNA KEEP WORKING ON THE SHELTER. I'M NOT GETTING MY HOPES UP FOR FIRE JUST YET. I HAVE LITTLE FAITH IN THIS RIGHT NOW. BUGS HAVE EATEN EVERYTHING. ALL THE MIDDLES OF EVERYTHING I'VE FOUND ARE HOLLOW. THIS IS JUST REALLY HARD. THIS IS TOUGH. NEVER HAD THIS MUCH PROBLEM MAKING FIRE. UH, WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF DAYLIGHT. STARTING TO LOSE A LITTLE HOPE HERE. WELL, WE'RE STARTING TO RUN OUT OF TIME HERE. WE MIGHT NEED PLAN B AND FORGO THAT, JUST DRINK THE WATER. Julie: PUMA WANTS TO DRINK THE WATER FROM THE RIVER WITHOUT BOILING IT -- BAD IDEA. LATER ON, IF WE'RE GONNA DRINK CONTAMINATED WATER, THAT COULD POSSIBLY END OUR SURVIVAL TRIP. Puma: IN THE RIGHT CONDITIONS, FIRE-MAKING IS EASY, USUALLY. BUT SPENDING HOURS LIKE THIS TRYING TO GET NOTHING BECOMES AN ACTION OF FUTILITY AT SOME POINT. I THINK IT'S WORTH IT. LET'S JUST KEEP IT UP. Julie: PUMA IS CLEARLY A LITTLE UNHAPPY, SO I'M GONNA STEP IN AND MAKE THIS FIRE. DEHYDRATION'S GETTING TO ME. MY MOTOR SKILLS ARE LACKING. I HAVE GOOD FAITH THAT THIS WILL WORK. GONNA BE A CHALLENGE FOR ME TO DO THIS, BUT I HAVE TO BE PATIENT. YEAH, WELL, I'M TAKING A BREAK. Puma: I'VE HAD DEHYDRATION BEFORE. I'VE ACTUALLY PASSED OUT IN THE HEAT. AND IT'S LIKE A LIGHT SWITCH TURNING ON. IT HITS YOU, AND IT'S KIND OF HARD TO PULL BACK OUT OF IT. I'VE SURVIVED IN ALL KINDS OF ENVIRONMENTS, BUT THIS JUNGLE IS REALLY GETTING TO ME. I KNOW IF I DRINK UNPURIFIED CREEK WATER, THERE'S A RISK OF GETTING AN INFECTION. BUT IF I DON'T DRINK, I'LL PROBABLY PASS OUT WITH DEHYDRATION. I FOUND SOME WATER HERE. IT'S GOOD WATER, BUT IT'S KIND OF FAR FROM CAMP. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA TELL JULIE ABOUT THIS ONE. OUR OPTIONS ARE REALLY RUNNING THIN, SO YOU'RE BETTER OFF TAKING THE CHANCE AND POSSIBLY SUFFERING IN THE LONG RUN THAN SUFFERING NOW. Julie: JUST TOTALLY EXHAUSTED. I'M NOT THINKING CLEARLY RIGHT NOW, SO I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS THING FOR HOURS WITH NO LUCK. MUCH BIGGER DEAL THAN IT WAS YESTERDAY. WITHOUT WATER, MY BODY JUST TIRES OUT A LOT FASTER. I JUST NEED A BREAK. I FEEL LIGHTHEADED AND DIZZY. MY HEART IS RACING. IT FEELS WEAK. I AM BEYOND THIRSTY. MY THROAT IS BURNING, AND I FEEL LIKE MY TONGUE IS SWOLLEN. I AM SO DEHYDRATED. AND I'M OVERHEATING. I NEED TO COOL MYSELF OFF. [ GROANS ] I NEED TO DRINK WATER! [ GROANS ] OH. DAMN. [ GRUNTS ] REALLY DON'T WANT TO DRINK THE CREEK WATER. Puma: IT'S DAY THREE, AND JULIE'S LOOKING A LITTLE ROUGH. IF SHE DOESN'T GET HYDRATED TODAY, JULIE IS DONE. SHE'LL BLACK OUT, GUARANTEED. I THINK I NEED SOME WATER. I'M HYDRATED. I'M FEELING A LITTLE BETTER. BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT JULIE. SO I'M SEARCHING THE WATER LINE UP AND DOWN THE RIVER HERE, AND I'M LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF UNDERGROUND TRIBUTARY OR RUNOFF. IN JUNGLES LIKE THIS, THE RAINWATER SOMETIMES FILTERS THROUGH THE SOIL AND COLLECTS IN UNDERGROUND POOLS. THAT'S DRINKABLE WATER, AND THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. HOPEFULLY THERE'S ENOUGH WATER HERE TO KEEP JULIE GOING UNTIL WE MAKE A FIRE. [ GROANS ] OH, MY GOD. I THINK I'M GONNA PASS OUT. Narrator: BEFORE PUMA AND JULIE EMBARKED ON THIS MISSION, THEY WERE ASSESSED BY SURVIVAL EXPERTS AND EACH GIVEN A PRIMITIVE SURVIVAL RATING, OR PSR. THEY WILL BE REASSESSED AFTER THE CHALLENGE ENDS. SON OF A *BLEEP* Narrator: UNABLE TO MAKE FIRE TO PURIFY WATER, PUMA'S MAVERICK NATURE GETS THE BETTER OF HIM WHEN HE DRINKS FROM A POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATED STREAM, CONCEALING THIS FROM JULIE. JULIE HAS HAD LITTLE WATER IN TWO DAYS. HER SURVIVAL KNOWLEDGE TELLS HER SHE IS DANGEROUSLY DEHYDRATED. PUMA IS SEARCHING FOR A SOURCE OF DRINKABLE GROUND WATER TO HELP HER RECOVER. Puma: I'M JUST LOOKING, LOOKING, LOOKING. [ GROANS ] I'M CONCERNED FOR JULIE BECAUSE IF SHE DOESN'T GET WATER TODAY, SHE'S GONNA GO DOWNHILL PRETTY QUICK. IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE ALREADY. I'M ALREADY FEELING PRETTY GOOD. THAT WATER FEELS GOOD. I'M HYDRATED. I GOT TO REALLY STEP UP AND HELP JULIE RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE SHE'S HURTING. THAT'S WATER. OOH! [ CHUCKLES ] SO, RAINWATER FILTERS THROUGH THE SOIL UNDERGROUND HERE, AND THAT'S DRINKABLE WATER. NOW I JUST HAVE TO TAP IT. OH, MY GOD. I AM SO EXCITED. Puma: CLEAN UP FOR A COCKTAIL PARTY. HAVING THAT WATER IS JUST -- IT'S ESSENTIAL... DRINK IT. ...FOR KEEPING OUR MORALE UP, FOR KEEPING OUR STRENGTH UP. IT WAS JUST AMAZING TO HAVE THAT WATER DRIPPING OUT OF THE EARTH ON THAT PIECE OF BAMBOO. IT'S MAGICAL. MAN, PUMA'S A LIFESAVER. WHEW. Puma: THE PROBLEM WITH THESE UNDERGROUND STREAMS IS THEY RUN OUT REAL QUICK. WE STILL NEED TO GET THAT FIRE TO HAVE VIABLE WATER. Julie: I'M WORKING ON FIRE, AND I'M TRYING REALLY HARD TO GET A COAL AND GET THAT FIRE GOING 'CAUSE I KNOW I CAN DO IT, AND I'M GIVING IT MY ALL. GIVE THAT A SHOT. A LITTLE HARDER. OH, YEAH. IT'S COMING NOW. UH-OH. LOSING MY GRIP. TYPICAL. THERE IT IS. YEAH. YEAH! OH, MY GOD! AAH! LOOK AT THAT. GO FOR IT. CLOSE IT AROUND THERE. GORGEOUS. GO FOR IT. YEAH, YOU GOT IT. GO. TAKE YOUR TIME. WATCH YOUR STEP. DOOR. HERE IT IS. OH. WHERE IS IT? [ CLAPS HANDS ] YEAH! [ LAUGHS ] CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? HIGH FIVE! [ BOTH LAUGH ] Julie: ALL THAT PREP PAID OFF. I'M FEELING PRETTY *BLEEP* GOOD. THIS IS REALLY GOING TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. IT'S AWESOME. [ LAUGHS ] THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING. THIS COVERS A MULTITUDE OF OUR NEEDS. IT'S HEAT. IT'S DRYING OUT OUR LITTLE ENVIRONMENT UP HERE. IT'S COOKING FOOD. IT'S MORALE. [ LAUGHS ] EXCELLENT. I'M ALMOST TO TEARS RIGHT NOW. IT FEELS REALLY GOOD. I'M EXTREMELY PROUD OF JULIE FOR HAVING SUCH AN AMAZING SKILL. I MEAN, I CAN DO IT, BUT I HAVE A TENDENCY TO GIVE UP A LITTLE BIT EASIER. YEAH, DEFINITELY. ESPECIALLY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. SO, THIS WAS GREAT. AHH, THAT FEELS GOOD. NOW THAT WE HAVE FIRE, WE CAN FINALLY BOIL WATER AND HAVE A STEADY SOURCE. Julie: WHEN YOU GET DEHYDRATED OUT HERE, YOU JUST GET SO WEAK SO FAST. AND DRINKING THE PUREST AWESOMENESS FROM THE EARTH, IT IS JUST WONDERFUL. TO FEEL MY STRENGTH COMING BACK, IT WAS MAGICAL. Puma: AFTER ALL THIS TIME TOGETHER, MINE AND JULIE'S RELATIONSHIP IS BASICALLY BLOSSOMING. WE ALREADY FEEL LIKE WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR QUITE A WHILE. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THAT VIBE, IT MAKES IT A LOT EASIER. I ACTUALLY CONSIDERED THAT BEFORE COMING OUT, THE COUNTERPART THAT I MIGHT BE MATCHED UP WITH. I'M ACTUALLY REALLY GLAD THAT WE HAVE THAT VIBE. IT'S JUST -- JUST WORKING OUT WELL. IT REALLY IS A GREAT MATCH-UP. WE SET SOME TRAPS A COUPLE DAYS AGO IN THE RIVER. GOT ME. ALL RIGHT, HERE GOES ONE. TIME FOR YOU GUYS TO GO IN, LITTLE CRABBIES. AND NOW THAT WE HAVE FIRE, WE CAN ACTUALLY COOK WHAT WE CATCH. IT MEANS PROTEIN. SURPRISINGLY, WORMS HAVE AMAZING PROTEIN VALUE. YOU KNOW, A HANDFUL OF WORMS IS EQUAL TO A CHEESEBURGER. THEY'RE REALLY HIGH IN NUTRITION. GONNA BE DELICIOUS, I GUESS. [ LAUGHS ] Julie: NOW THAT I HAVE MY ENERGY BACK, I'M GONNA DO SOME MAINTENANCE ON THE SHELTER. THESE LEAVES PROTECT US FROM THE SUN AND KEEP US DRY IN THE RAIN. WELL, IF I EVER WANT TO COME BACK AND LIVE IN THE JUNGLE, NOW I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW I WOULD ACTUALLY DO IT. EXTRANEOUS MOVEMENT BACK UP THE HILL. UH-OH. UH-OH. JULIE. NO COALS LEFT. I THINK WE BLEW IT. *BLEEP* I'LL COME DOWN, OKAY? I'LL COME DOWN AND LOOK. LET'S FEEL. IT'S HOT. LET'S ACTUALLY GET IN THERE AND -- WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS AN EMBER. WE SHOULD HAVE A SCHEDULE FOR THIS IN THE FUTURE, SOME SORT OF PLAN. WE LOSE OUR FIRE, AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT? REALLY?" I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS. WE GOT TOO BUSY, TOO DISTRACTED. "WE"? YOU KNOW, TRY NOT TO BLAME PUMA EVEN THOUGH *BLEEP* RIGHT THERE NEXT TO IT. IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED. CHECKED ON IT A WHILE AGO AND GOT IT GOING, AND WE HAVEN'T DONE IT SINCE. I DID IT A FEW TIMES. THERE'S NO EMBERS IN OUR FIRE ANYMORE. THAT'S HOW WE BLOW THE COAL BACK INTO FLAME. THERE'S NO EMBERS RIGHT NOW. *BLEEP* THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] REALLY? COME ON, JUNGLE. GIVE US ONE MORE BREAK. [ THUNDER CRASHES ] Puma: AT THIS POINT, IT'S POURING RAIN. I CAN HARDLY SEE INTO THE JUNGLE. I'M SOAKING WET, I'M SHIVERING, AND IT'S TOTALLY APPARENT THAT I'M BLOWING IT. THE JUNGLE IS RELENTLESS. IT NEVER STOPS. [ THUNDER CRASHES ] Julie: MAKING FIRE IN THIS WEATHER IS IMPOSSIBLE. COULD REALLY USE SOME SUPPORT. [ SIGHS ] EVERYTHING IS JUST DRENCHED. CAN I GET YOUR SUPPORT FOR A MINUTE? I'LL NEED YOUR HELP. CAN YOU JUST HOLD ME UP? I REALLY WANT TO GET MORE OF THIS DOWN BEFORE YOU GET THAT GOING. WHAT? YEAH, I REALLY -- I CAN'T WORK UNDER HERE. I'M JUST -- I'M NOT GOING TO. OKAY. YOU'RE DEFENSIVE. YEAH. IF YOU DIDN'T LET THE FIRE GO OUT... [ SIGHS ] THAT'S PART OF THE FRUSTRATION. I'M TRYING NOT TO EXPLODE RIGHT NOW. I NEED SOME ALONE TIME. I NEED ABOUT 10 MINUTES. WITHOUT FIRE, THE FOOD SITUATION IS DOWN TO PLANTS. WITHOUT FIRE, WE'RE RABBITS. I'M REALLY PISSED OFF. I DIDN'T LET THE FIRE GO OUT. IT'S DEFINITELY COLD AND WET. EVERYTHING'S SOGGY. I'M DEFINITELY FRUSTRATED. GROSS. LEECH. I AM HATING LEECHES RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO KILL EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM AND MAKE THEM ALL DIE. [ THUNDER CRASHES ] POTENTIAL DANGERS OF THIS RAIN, FIRST AND FOREMOST, IS HYPOTHERMIA. THERE IS A POINT EVERY NIGHT AROUND 3:00 OR 4:00 A.M. WHERE A CHILL COMES ON. AND WITH EVERYTHING WET, IT'S GONNA BE A MAJOR ISSUE. IF WE DO GO HYPOTHERMIC, THEN THE GAME'S PROBABLY OVER. Julie: THIS NOW IS A SERIOUS SURVIVAL SITUATION. THE RAIN IS JUST POURING DOWN ON US. THE RIVER'S FLOODING. IT'S NOW GETTING REAL. THAT TREE UP THERE IS REALLY CONCERNING. IT'S ALMOST DIRECTLY OVER OUR CAMP, AND IT SHED THIS HUGE BRANCH, WHICH HIT THE GROUND LIKE A SPEAR. IT WAS RAZOR SHARP. AND THAT COULD HAVE EASILY KILLED US IF IT HAD HIT US. I'M ALREADY CHILLED TO THE BONE. THE RIVER IS FLASH FLOODING. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF WE COULD GET OUT OF HERE IF WE WANTED TO QUIT. Narrator: A TROPICAL STORM RIPS THROUGH THE BORNEO JUNGLE, CAUSING RIVERS TO SURGE AND UPROOTING TREES. WITH NO FIRE, PUMA AND JULIE ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY WARM AND OUT OF DANGER. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] WE REACHED NEAR HYPOTHERMIC SITUATION. AND WITH THE RIVER FLOODING, IT JUST KIND OF BECAME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT OUR SAFETY IS NOT ASSURED. [ BRANCHES CRACKING ] Julie: AAH! ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO, A GIANT 80-FOOT TREE CAME CRASHING DOWN 10 FEET FROM OUR SHELTER AND ALMOST CRUSHED US. SAW IT COMING AND PRETTY MUCH KISSED MY ASS GOODBYE. IT MISSED US BY ABOUT 15 FEET. THE THING IS, THAT KIND OF THING MIGHT NOT BE OVER. YOU KNOW, THE HILLSIDE STARTS SLIDING AWAY AND THINGS START CRASHING DOWN. SCREW THIS. THIS IS THE MORNING AFTER THE BIG TREE FALL THAT HIT OUR SHELTER IN THE NIGHT AND FREAKED US BOTH OUT. YOU CAN SEE THIS TREE, IT JUST FELL AND CRACKED. THIS OTHER TREE'S LEANING ON IT RIGHT NOW. IT WAS A REALLY CLOSE CALL. I MEAN, WE COULD BE DEAD RIGHT NOW. Puma: OVERNIGHT, A TORRENTIAL RAINSTORM TORE OUR SHELTER APART, KILLED OUR FIRE. THE CHIPS GET STACKED AGAINST YOU. REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH EXPERIENCE YOU MAY HAVE, THINGS CAN GO SIDEWAYS REALLY QUICK. PEOPLE DIE, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THEM, SO WE'RE GONNA START TO REBUILD THE SHELTER. THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO. OH, MAN. [ SIGHS ] NO ENERGY. ARE YOU OKAY? TOTALLY FATIGUED. MASSIVE HEADACHE. MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE A REST. MY HANDS ARE SHAKING. THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN. YOU'LL BE OKAY. [ GROANS ] I'VE GOT A GNARLY FEVER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. BODY ACHES, CHILLS, HEAD HURTS. Julie: PUMA'S NOT IN A GOOD WAY RIGHT NOW. HE'S GOT A TERRIBLE FEVER. HE'S SHIVERING. HE IS MOANING. OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T SEE HIM MAKING IT THROUGH THE NIGHT. I DON'T THINK THE JUNGLE WANTS ME HERE ANYMORE. I'M NOT LISTENING. [ MOANS ] [ SIGHS ] I THINK I MAY HAVE BEEN BIT BY A SPIDER OR SOMETHING. Narrator: WRACKED WITH PAIN AND SUFFERING FROM HIGH FEVER... MASSIVE HEADACHE. ...PUMA'S CONDITION WORSENS RAPIDLY. IT'S CRAZY. HEAD HURTS. IT'S KIND OF COLD AGAIN. I GOT THE CHILLS. COLD. COLD. [ MOANS ] PUMA NEEDS MEDICAL HELP, BUT THE STORM HAS SWOLLEN THE RIVER AND UPROOTED TREES IN THE AREA. THEY ARE STRANDED WITH NO HOPE OF HELP UNTIL DAYBREAK. PUMA WILL HAVE TO WAIT IT OUT. AS DAY BREAKS, PUMA'S CONDITION HAS REACHED CRISIS POINT. HE'S SHIVERING. HE IS MOANING. HE IS CRAMPED UP. HE SAID HIS WHOLE BODY FEELS LIKE A BRUISE. WITH THE RIVER NOW SUBSIDED, PRODUCERS ARE FINALLY ABLE TO GET PUMA MUCH-NEEDED MEDICAL ATTENTION. MY GOD. THE MEDICS ARE UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE PUMA'S HIGH FEVER. THEY SUSPECT CHOLERA, TYPHOID, DENGUE FEVER, OR EVEN MALARIA. IF NOT TREATED IN TIME, ALL THESE CAN BE FATAL. HMM? HMM? PUMA'S TEMPERATURE QUICKLY CLIMBS TO A STAGGERING 105 DEGREES. ERIC, ERIC, COME IN. HIS EYES ARE GETTING RED. TO ME, THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN. HIS TEMPERATURE IS QUITE HIGH, AND THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED TO DIP HIM IN THE CREEK. Narrator: THE TEAM EMPLOYS EMERGENCY MEASURES TO LOWER HIS CORE BODY TEMPERATURE. THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE DO WHEN WE'RE IN THE RAINFOREST. Julie: I REALLY CARE ABOUT PUMA. LIKE, I WANT HIM TO BE OKAY. MAYBE HE'LL PULL THROUGH. I DON'T KNOW. BUT AT THIS POINT, I JUST DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANY CASUALTIES. Woman: HE'S GONNA BE FINE, OKAY? [ Voice breaking ] I'M SCARED. BE STRONG. YOU'RE GONNA BE STRONG, OKAY? HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CONTINUE 12 DAYS ALONE? Narrator: PUMA'S FEVER IS PUTTING HIS LIFE IN DANGER. HE HAS TO BE EVACUATED IMMEDIATELY TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL. THE MEDICS FEAR THAT PUMA HAS CONTRACTED ONE OF THE JUNGLE'S DEADLY VIRUSES FROM CONTAMINATED WATER. PUMA IS TESTED FOR A VARIETY OF INFECTIONS AS THEY STRUGGLE TO STABILIZE HIM. JULIE IS NOW ON HER OWN. WELL, HERE I AM. THIS IS MY FIRST NIGHT ALONE. IT'S GETTING TOWARDS DARK, AND PUMA'S NOT HERE. IT'S REALLY QUIET. IT'S REALLY JUST ME WITH MY THOUGHTS RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW, I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD COME TO THIS, ME BEING ALONE OUT HERE. YOU KNOW, I COULD HAVE QUIT WHEN PUMA QUIT, AND I DECIDED NOT TO. SO, HERE I AM. [ CHUCKLES ] PUT ON NIGHT VISION HERE. [ INSECTS CHIRPING ] YOU KNOW, I GOT THIS REALLY SWEET FIRE RIGHT HERE, TOO. I MEAN, IT'S JUST ROARING. I MEAN...YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY FEEL KIND OF GOOD. [ CHUCKLES ] JUST GONNA TRY SLEEPING TONIGHT AND SEE HOW IT GOES. I THINK IT WILL GO WELL. Narrator: EVEN THOUGH JULIE WAS ABLE TO REKINDLE HER FIRE, HER EXTREME LACK OF FOOD IS TAKING ITS TOLL. WHEW! Julie: PRODUCTION'S TOLD ME THAT PUMA'S STILL IN THE HOSPITAL FOR OBSERVATION, AND I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HIM RIGHT NOW. DEFINITELY FEELING SCARED, BUT HE REALLY LEFT ME IN A POSITION TO HOPEFULLY THRIVE OUT HERE. PUMA LEFT ME WITH THIS FISH BASKET. IT'S GOT, LIKE, BAIT IN THERE. BUT I'M GONNA GO SET THIS. HOPEFULLY THEY'LL JUST COME FOR IT. SOME OF THIS ROTTEN COCONUT. I'M JUST GONNA POUND IT INTO THERE. HOPEFULLY THAT WILL DO IT. HERE, LITTLE FISHIES. COME AND EAT IT. I THINK THIS FISH TRAP SHOULD BE PRETTY SOUND. I'M FOLLOWING THE PLAN THAT WE ALREADY PUT IN PLACE. IN ORDER TO HAVE FIRE, I NEED FIREWOOD, WHICH TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY. IN ORDER TO HAVE ENERGY TO GATHER IT, I KIND OF NEED TO EAT STUFF. Narrator: WITH PUMA GONE, JULIE NOW HAS TO DO THE WORK OF TWO PEOPLE. Julie: IT TAKES SO MUCH ENERGY TO KEEP A FIRE GOING. LIKE, IT'S GONNA TAKE SO MUCH ENERGY TO DO THAT. FIRE IS, LIKE, LIFE OUT HERE, SO DEFINITELY DON'T WANT IT TO GO OUT. ALMOST TWO WEEKS IN AND WEAKENED BY STARVATION, JULIE'S ONLY HOPE IS THAT THE FISH TRAPS WORK. PLEASE BE SOMETHING IN THERE. NOTHING. WELL, WE GOT THIS FISH BASKET. THAT'S AWESOME. AND IT'S BASICALLY A BASKET INSIDE A BASKET. THIS WILL BE TUCKED DOWN IN THERE LIKE THAT. AND WE'LL BAIT IT WITH SOME OF THAT FUNKY STUFF WE GOT, THE OLD, DEAD CRAB. THE SCENT TRAVELS FOR A COUPLE HUNDRED YARDS DOWNSTREAM. WE'RE GONNA JUST START BRINGING THEM IN. THE FISH CAN GET IN THROUGH THE LITTLE ONE. AND WHEN THEY TRY AND GET OUT, THEY JUST CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THE EXIT AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW WHY. IT'S PRETTY MIRACULOUS. BUT I ALREADY SEE THEM COMING. Narrator: IN THE BORNEO JUNGLE, PUMA RISKED DRINKING FROM A NEARBY CREEK. I DON'T THINK THE JUNGLE WANTS ME HERE ANYMORE. HE DEVELOPED DANGEROUS FEVER OF 105 DEGREES AND HAD TO BE EVACUATED TO A HOSPITAL, LEAVING JULIE TO CARRY ON ALONE AND ON THE BRINK OF STARVATION. PLEASE BE SOMETHING IN THERE. NOTHING. DANG! [ SIGHS ] YOU KNOW, I NEVER PLANNED ON THIS BEING A TRIP OF SUFFERING. I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD JUST BE THRIVING. IT'S JUST ME HERE ALONE, SUFFERING. [ SCOFFS ] Narrator: YET ANOTHER DAY PASSES, AND THE FISH TRAP STILL PRODUCES NOTHING. Julie: IT'S JUST -- THERE'S NO POINT. LIKE, THERE'S NO FOOD, AND THE FISH TRAP FAILED. I MEAN, MISERABLY FAILED. Narrator: AFTER FOUR DAYS ALONE, JULIE FINALLY REACHES HER OWN CRISIS POINT. Julie: I THINK AFTER PUMA LEFT, LIKE, I WAS OKAY FOR A FEW DAYS, BUT NOW I'M FEELING PRETTY WEAK AND I'M FEELING REALLY EMOTIONALLY DEPLETED, AS WELL. IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT. I KNOW I CHOSE TO STAY, BUT, LIKE, I'M JUST -- I DON'T KNOW. LIKE, I FEEL SICK. I JUST DON'T REALLY HAVE THE ENERGY. IT FEELS LIKE A LOT OF WORK, AND I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT. THE FIRE'S OUT. *BLEEP* [ GRUNTS ] [ GROANS ] I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS. I HAVE A FEELING I FAILED. I DIDN'T HAVE THE ENERGY TO KEEP THE FIRE GOING. I'M REALLY TIRED RIGHT NOW. I JUST KIND OF WANT TO, LIKE, KICK IT, BUT I CAN'T REALLY DO THAT, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. I'M JUST -- I'M SCARED, YOU KNOW? LIKE, I'M OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE *BLEEP* JUNGLE. LIKE, PUMA HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO [SIGHS] I'M SCARED. [ GROANS ] MY EXPERIENCE WITH PUMA -- THAT IF I LET THE DARK SIDE TAKE OVER, I'M GONNA DEFINITELY NOT MAKE IT. EVEN JUST GETTING UP TO PEE HURTS. [ GROANS ] MY WHOLE BODY ACHES. OHH. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS, IF IT'S WHAT PUMA CAME DOWN WITH OR WHAT, BUT I'M REALLY SCARED. BEING SICK IN THE JUNGLE HAS BEEN THE HARDEST THING OF MY LIFE. I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR SUFFERING AT ALL. [ GROANS ] JUST PHYSICAL SUFFERING. AND THAT REALLY AFFECTS MY MIND-SET, TOO, AND CAUSES ME TO WANT TO GIVE UP. AS AN INSTRUCTOR, I KNOW THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP CONTROL OF IS YOUR OWN MIND AND EMOTIONS, AND I'M NOT SURE I'M ABLE TO DO THAT. FOR SIX WEEKS BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE, I SPENT EVERY WAKING MOMENT PREPARING FOR THIS TRIP. ALMOST NONE OF MY PREPARATIONS MEANT ANYTHING. WHILE I HAVE GREAT TRAINING AND SKILLS, I'VE NEVER HAD TO TEST THEM IN SUCH AN EXTREME WAY. THIS PLACE IS WAY BEYOND ANYTHING I EVER IMAGINED. MY BODY IS TELLING ME THAT BEING OUT HERE IS NOT WORKING FOR ME ANYMORE. THIS IS MY VOICE OF AUTHORITY SAYING IT'S TIME FOR ME TO TAP OUT. Narrator: JULIE LASTED 18 DAYS BEFORE THE BORNEO JUNGLE FINALLY BEAT HER DOWN. Julie: THE JUNGLE IS A HARSH TEACHER. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT I NEED TO LEARN. I REALLY HOPE THIS FAILURE DOESN'T, LIKE, PUT ME IN A MORE EMOTIONALLY DEPRESSED PLACE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALMOST BEYOND WORDS, SOMETHING THAT'S JUST GONNA BE WITH ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I THINK PUMA AND I DEFINITELY GOT MORE THAN WE BARGAINED FOR. THE JUNGLE IS NO JOKE. IT SUCKS. PUMA AND JULIE BOTH FAILED TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE 21-DAY CHALLENGE IN THE JUNGLE OF BORNEO. THEY BOTH RECEIVED A LESSON IN THE HARSHNESS OF PRIMITIVE SURVIVAL FROM AN UNRELENTING ENVIRONMENT. IN 10 DAYS, PUMA LOST A TOTAL OF 15 POUNDS. AND IN 18 DAYS, JULIE LOST 30. PUMA WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL AFTER SEVEN DAYS. THE VIRUS WAS FOUND TO BE NON-LETHAL. JULIE IS NOW BACK IN SEATTLE. WITH HER NEWFOUND KNOWLEDGE, SHE CONTINUES TO TEACH COURSES ON SURVIVAL TECHNIQUES. SURVIVAL EXPERTS REVIEWED PUMA AND JULIE IN TERMS OF THEIR SKILL, EXPERIENCE, AND MENTAL APPROACH AND THEN REASSESSED THEM BOTH ACCORDING TO HOW WELL THEY COPED WITH THEIR CHALLENGE. PUMA DISPLAYED GREAT BUSHCRAFT SKILLS AND MENTAL FLEXIBILITY WHILE JULIE'S EXPERIENCE KEPT THEM BOTH FOCUSED. BUT PUMA'S MAVERICK DECISION TO DRINK UNPURIFIED WATER TOOK HIM OUT OF THE CHALLENGE, FRACTURING THE OUTFIT. JULIE WAS UNABLE TO ADJUST TO THE ABSENCE OF PUMA AND INEVITABLY TAPPED OUT DUE TO DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. NEITHER COMPLETED THEIR 21-DAY CHALLENGE. OVERALL, PUMA'S PSR DROPPED TO 6.1 WHILE JULIE, DESPITE HER QUITTING, ONLY DROPS TO 5.0. ALTHOUGH GIVING IT THEIR BEST, PUMA AND JULIE DID NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO SURVIVE NAKED AND AFRAID. IT REALLY IS NO JOKE. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS
