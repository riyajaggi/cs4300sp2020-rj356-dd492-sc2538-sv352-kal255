 [sam] I'm over it, joe. Stop being stubborn. You need to drink. Like, I have tried to help you. -I absolutely do... -When is the gravity of this situation gonna hit you? I'm not bringing you water anymore. I'll let you [bleep] die. Like, I'm done. -I... -Okay? So either you need to tap out or get the [bleep] out of the sun. I'm questioning whether or not it was dehydration.

 - Okay? Yes, it was a... - Then give me the [bleep] water. - Obviously you don't need it. - Oh, for god's sakes. Awesome. And I'll put the fire out that I just got going, too. [man 1] there's nothing easy about this. [screaming] [man 2] we got hail. [growling] - [growling] - [yells] whoo! My heart's racing. [woman 1] you don't fight, you won't make it. Tried so hard! [woman] I'm stuck in the woods with the devil. [joe] I've never been to montana before.

 I am seeing a lot of claw marks on these trees. There's definitely bears out here. [sam] there have been grizzly attacks out here before. One happened two days ago. So this is the craziest thing I've ever done. [narrator] at the northern tip of the rockies near the canadian border lies grizzly mountain, montana. A steep and rugged landscape of pine forests and grasslands. The dramatic changes in elevation between the plains and the mountains make for unpredictable weather and temperatures can swing by as much as 50 degrees in a single day, going from scorching to freezing. I am seeing nothing but dense forest. [laughs] [narrator] lumbering in the pine forest of grizzly mountain are the massive bears the area is named after as well as black bear and mountain lions. But an even bigger threat out here are the moose. They can reach seven feet high and charge at 35 miles per hour using their antlers and hooves to injure or kill. [sam] a moose attack out here would probably not just end my challenge, but could end my life. [growling] [joe] that is unbelievable. We got snow up here. You know, no matter how much research I did before I actually got here, now looking around, it's just very overwhelming. What in the hell did I get myself into? Being a survivalist, I'm not a professional. I'm not gonna pretend to be. I don't teach this for a living, but I'm passionate about it. I got to learn primitive survival at a very early age. It was actually with scouts with my father. Between trapping, fire making... Oh, yeah. ...To shelter building, hunting. But what was most important for it? You know, it was just a chance for me and my dad just to be together, just me and him. It was at an early age I found out that I was adopted. My parents, they just, they weren't able to have children. It was difficult growing up. It really just felt like I was abandoned. Then I started to question my own self worth at that point. [exhales] but being a survivalist, I believe when you finally strip everything away, that's where you get to realize the true content of your character. Now, if I can get through this, if that doesn't say I'm worth something, I don't know what the hell does. [narrator] joe has studied primitive survival for years, but most of his knowledge has not been tested in the wild. He begins with a psr or primitive survival rating of six point five. [sam] oh, my gosh, the shade and it gets so cold. Being naked out here does not look like it's gonna be very much fun at all. I think it's gonna suck, and I'm really excited about it. I've been a survivalist since I was 16 when my dad kicked me out for being gay. I was homeless for quite a few years. When I was hungry, I learned the hard way how to set traps. This was before youtube and everything. So a lot of trial and error, a lot of hungry nights. I had to learn how to make deadfalls. But snares are really my strong suit. I can basically snare just about any animal. Spring snares, ground snares. Ah! We have a bobby. [laughs] it's just from being forced to rely on yourself that you learn these things, uh, the hard way. That's actually pretty freaking sharp. Probably a lot of people would think that once you've been forced out in the nature to survive, you wouldn't want to go out again. But that's where I really found my peace. It's really where I found myself. Pain and suffering, I mean, that's what really makes you feel alive. You can't experience the sunshine without rain. You don't appreciate those things until all hell breaks loose and you've lost it all. [narrator] sam suffered alone in the wilderness at a young age. And while it's given her the skills to survive on her own, she's never had to survive with a partner in the harsh montana wilderness. She begins with a psr of six point eight. I guess we're here. Let's do this [bleep]. I'm what they call a gold star lesbian. That's right, gold star. I haven't seen a naked dude before, like, ever in my life. [exhales] oh, here we go. [sam] like, how does that all work? When he walks does it just swing around? [laughs] what if I, like, touch it? Oh, my god. Oh! What the [bleep]! Ew! Oh, uh, whatever. It's already immediately colder without clothes. I'm so nervous. Oh, hello! Yeah, so I'm not the only crazy one out here, huh? Nope, not at all. - How are you? - Pleasure to meet you. - Okay, joe. - Joe, sam. I'm really like... I'm just... Mind blown? Doesn't feel real, does it? Not yet at least. I'm just so thrilled to actually see I'm not the only nut out here. Right? It's 'cause you know that there's other crazy people in the world. Uh, looking at a naked guy for the first time. Not so bad. Just don't look below the necklace. It's a quick transition from necklace to penis, so just don't... Just... Necklace is it. - You ready for this? - Are you? Let's do this. - Oh, let's kill it. - All right. [narrator] sam has brought a knife, and joe has brought a fire starter and they have been given a pot as the elevation and extreme temperature changes make dehydration a serious risk. So I got the map. -[joe] excellent. What do we got? -All right. - So... - Uh-oh. Boom, we got bears definitely. [sam] bears. Snake, elk, moose. - Looks like this is about where we are. - All right. We definitely got to get to water. We know that. Look, there's a game trail. - Why don't we take that down? - 100% - [laughs] - let's rock this. [sam] all right, let's do it. [joe] oh, check it out. There's our first scat. Good eye. -[joe] here you got mule deer or elk? - Yeah. Any experience, like, uh, hunting or tracking? Uh, tracking and trapping. - Really? - What about yourself? [joe] oh, I'm right there with you. [exhales] this sun is a killer. Very unexpected coming out here. - How radical temperature changes. - It is. Oh, look at this. - [joe] oh, hell. - That looks like bear to me. [joe] oh, lord. [sam] like you can actually see, like, the fingers. [joe] oh, check it out. Yeah, we got bears here. - That is fresh. - Oh, it sucks. A grizzly, I mean, you can only do so much, so, you know, just lay down and pray it doesn't tear your insides open. [chuckles] yay. Bears. [joe] how you feel about getting, uh, some kind of forest protection? That tree that you just have your hand on. You wanna go ahead and hack that down? We could probably fashion a spear fairly quickly. All right. I don't think I could have possibly asked for a better partner than what I've got. You know, sam is incredibly knowledgeable. Um... She's... Great personality. I think it's a really excellent pairing. [sam] I feel like we're gonna make a really good team. [laughs] - I feel good about this. - Right? [sam] my partner is amped to be out here, which is awesome. He's like a kid in a candy store. I'll be damned. Ripe juniper berries. And if you've ever seen a kid in a candy store, they get distracted pretty easily. I know we're in a hurry here, so I'm gonna be quick. Oh, man, we're losing a lot of light. We got a shelter to make, a fire to make, water to drink. You're telling a fat guy to give up food? - Ah. - [laughs] I love his attitude, though. It's gonna be good. You know what, sam? At any time, if you think I'm being a little, uh, pushy or what not, just please speak up, you know. Oh, 100%. -Don't worry. I am like that person. -Excellent. And, uh, same to you, 'cause I can be pretty intense. [joe] I'm sweating buckets out here. I can't wait to get something to drink. [sam] we definitely need to get that water before one of us gets, uh, dehydrated. [groans] oh, what the front door? It's funny. Trying to get ready for this. I could do hunger. I could do thirst. I didn't anticipate pain. [sam] really? - Mmm-hmm. - Okay. -[water rushing] -[joe] oh, is that what I think it is? [sam] it is. Oh. Oh, yay! [joe] I have never been so happy to see water. [sam] all right. I'm gonna go for it. You think? I usually definitely love to sterilize something before I drink it. Seeing her choosing to drink directly from the water source, uh, I got a lot of reservations here. I've drank some pretty gnarly tap water in third world countries. So I just feel like this beautiful creek, uh, doesn't really pose a threat to me. [joe] you know what? Success or fail, we'll do it as a team. Well, do you wanna put some usnea in it? There are some right there. [chuckles] [narrator] usnea is a lichen rich in anti-microbial properties that can aid in purifying water. If this water ends up not being any good, I could come down with a real world of hurt real quick. But I was already feeling dehydration coming on. [sighs] I took a chance. [sam] we're gonna boil from here on out. We're running out of daylight fast. What about right here? Why don't we hack off some of the bottom layers there? -Yeah. -Kind of reinforce what's above us and around us, - but almost like emulate like a boma. - Yeah. - All right. - Let's do this. [sam] so this shelter is called a "hurry up the [bleep] up and get it built before the sun goes down and you freeze and get eaten by bears" shelter. That's the technical name. [joe] you are something else, kiddo. [sam laughs] does that look like coyote to you? It's got hair in it. So it's a carnivore. [joe] this fire is gonna be a little bigger than I had anticipated. [sam] I have a feeling that it's not gonna be too difficult to get a fire out here. It's so dry. [joe] of all the fires I've made, this is gonna be the first one I've actually had to depend on for survival. [sam] oh, yeah? It definitely is, uh, a little bit more real life. [joe] nothing. [sighs] damn. This is certainly a lot more difficult than I thought it was gonna be. I can't figure out what in the world I'm doing wrong. - [sam] well, this is soaked. - You think? - [sam] oh, yeah. - It crumbled really easily. Feel it. There. I think we're gonna need, uh, a better actual tinder bundle. As far as our skill sets go, I am concerned. Joe is struggling with the fire. [sam] I'm gonna go exploring for a tinder bundle. [joe] all right. [sam] without a fire, we will die. So we need a fire. This is the baby tinder bundle. So hopefully it works. [joe] that is beautiful. [sighs] here we go. Come on. - [joe] fire! - [sam chuckles] [joe] you're the fire queen. [laughs] high five, dude. We friggin' did it! Oh, this is just awesome. [joe sighs] [sam] this is so close to boiling. Haven't talked about how close we're gonna sleep together. I will cuddle the [bleep] out of anything warm. I don't really care what's attached. It doesn't matter. This is survival. There's nothing sexual about this. [sam] the wind. I can feel it. I'm absolutely freezing. From being in the 90s today and a little sunburnt, it's making that all the more unpleasant. [sam] yeah, let's try laying down. I'm gonna get very close. - [shivering] - whatever you need. [sam] oh, my god, I'm so cold. [sam] it's so cold. [joe] all I could do was shiver. It's just horrible. We did not sleep at all. The ground was cold. The wind was cutting through our shelter. Most gold star lesbians have never seen a man naked. Let alone snuggled. [laughs] all throughout the night, shivering together. So I wonder if it, like, demotes me to a silver star. Gonna work together to try to insulate all the heat so that the fire's a little bit more contained. And then cover the ground with grass so that we don't freeze. Hey, sam, I need a minute. I feel sick. [exhales] [sam] are you okay? [joe] I just got really dizzy all of a sudden. Do you need water? - Are you okay? - I'm really feeling nauseous here all of a sudden. - [joe exhales] - probably dehydration or dysentery from the unprocessed water. It's one of the two. Something's up. Okay? [retches] [continues retching] oh, no. [joe retching] oh. [sam] joe drank the unprocessed water. He just threw up an awful lot. It does worry me. I don't know if he has dysentery... [retching] ...Or if he's just that dehydrated that he's struggling to keep water down. I really feel like a level of desperation for some kind of hydration here. [sam] all right. I totally understand. I'm gonna fill this up full. And I'm gonna meet you up shore. All right. It's gonna be a real issue if I can't keep anything down. Stupid mistake. Lesson learned. I always have to boil water. I don't know how sam does it. I feel completely useless right now. I cannot just lay here while my partner does all sorts of work. Yeah, I feel much better. I'm fine. All right. What can I help you with? [sam] we have a shelter that we need to fix so that we don't freeze. I think that if we do the teepee and bring the fire closer, smaller equals warmer. - All right. - Let's do it. We are making a teepee directly under the tree. We're hoping that when we add more wind protection and bedding that we will actually be able to sleep tonight. [joe] if we're gonna make this work, I gotta stack other rocks behind the fireplace itself to fill in the backing. You know, kind of help as a reflector wall bouncing back heat on us. [sam] we need to get some grass. Try to make ourselves comfortable. Just be careful when you're cutting. Just don't cut down any of the water hemlock. Don't touch. [laughs] [joe] there's hemlock everywhere you look. [narrator] hemlock stalks contain a highly poisonous sap that can be fatal within 15 minutes if ingested. [joe] if I touch this stuff, I'm gonna get a nasty reaction. If I ingest it, I mean, that's fatal. [sam] everything out here literally wants you to die. -[joe] we got shot at sleeping tonight. -[shivering] actually, that looks way better. [joe] a lot less holes. [sam] and that's gonna keep the wind off of us. [sam shivering] oh, my god, it gets so cold so fast. It is so cold. [joe] yeah. - We're dying. - [both chuckle] [growling] - [sam] did you hear that? - Yeah. What's that? What the hell was that? - [sam] hey! - Hey, little bear. [sam] here, bear. Come here, so I can kill you and take your fur. [joe] I don't hear it now. [sam] I don't see anything. I'm serious. I would kill a bear right now. I would go after it because I'm that cold. [joe] friggin' 90s during the day. [sam] and then at night we literally freeze. It feels like temperatures just drop 20 degrees at least. It's definitely colder than last night. [joe] yeah, I don't understand why more of this heat isn't staying trapped in here. [sam] we have to get shelter with a fireplace. Airtight. - Yeah. - No more, no more. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn It's so cold you can see joe's breath. [sam] we're gonna have to move. [joe] do you think so? [joe speaking] [sam] but it is. I mean, I don't think we have to move far. I mean, we could move right there. So we can get that morning sun. We wrapped everything and we tried to make it smaller to hold more heat, but it just didn't work. [thunder rumbling] [joe] yeah. Here comes the rain. I got some deep reservations here. I think we might be safer in, like, staying put just because it's already in place. Uh, this really could open up on us any time. Yes, but we already know it doesn't keep us warm. I know how to make a shelter that will keep us warm. I've done this before. I even lived in the woods in the cold for months in a natural-built shelter. Like, just trust me and let me do this. [joe] I feel like I could really reinforce this. - [sam] do you? - Yeah. I'm gonna bitch to you all night if it's not good. [joe sighs] fair enough. And just like, if we moved here, I'd expect you to bitch to me all night. - All right. - Yeah? - Yeah. Thank you. - Thank you. All right, let's do it, though. 'cause we, like, have no time. - It started sprinkling now. - All right. It's just gonna be a big gamble and a big leap of faith that I'm putting in him on this shelter. Which pole do you want? This one? This good one? - Um... - Or do you want the tree? - [thunder rumbling] - we're running out of time, - so let's go, let's go, let's go. - I know, I know, I know. All right, I'll take this one. - Okay, perfect. - Coming up. Okay. Perfect. Can you go up a little bit? - Uh. - Excellent. Thank you for giving me a little bit of faith in this. [sam] as long as it works. [joe] I know we're not gonna have a lot of time, so the plan is, I'm gonna fortify the shelter. Give us a little bit more barrier from the wind, sealing all around the fireplace. Placing more and more shingles on the sides trying to make this as watertight as possible. Again, on paper, it sounds great. I've never done this in a quick pinch. This is... I'm kind of doing this by the seat of my pants here. Just not a good idea. I get you're nervous. [sam] I mean, I don't get why you aren't. He says that he knows what he's doing. Now we'll find out. [laughs] [joe] actually, it sounds like the storm might have rolled off. [sam] it just shows how unpredictable the weather here is. [joe] oh, yeah. You can yell at me for the rest of the challenge if this doesn't work out. [sam] all right. Well, hopefully it does. 'cause I don't wanna be that person. Mmm. This shelter is garbage. That wind is coming through somewhere. And it's like... It's killer. - Oh, my god. - [joe] oh, that's cold. [sam] it's so different when you have clothes. [joe] it's because we are not meant to be in this kind of environment naked. [sam] yeah, we're gonna have to... ...Get clothes. - [joe] oh, it's cold. - It's freezing. [joe] oh, my god. [both shivering] it actually got so much worse. [sam] oh. [joe] everything is just numb and tingling right now. [sam] oh, my god. [shivering] I'm so cold. [joe] you wanna try and back up as much as you can and get that straw on your legs. [sam groans] it's because the shelter... It's total [bleep]. We're gonna get hypothermia. [sam] oh, my god. I'm freezing. I'm absolutely freezing. [joe] oh, my god, it's cold. [sam] I think it's colder in this. I think we need a solid shelter. It's got to be airtight. I mean, look, you're still shivering. [sam] I don't think you realize what it's like to actually... Like, I've lived out in the woods for months. My family kicked me out when I was 16 because I'm gay. [joe] oh, my god. [sam] yeah. [joe] I gotta listen to you more often. [whimpers] as far as shelters are concerned, we keep doing the same thing over and over and over again in the same spot. And that is not how I survived. When I lived out in the woods for eight months, I moved probably 30 times because I needed to find a good spot. And the winter is totally different than the summer. I'm not compromising. We aren't discussing this anymore. We're doing it my way. I want the sun so bad, joe. Because think about it, if we open the door and this is what's coming in... -[joe] yeah. - We need to just start busting it out. - All right. - Yay, survival. - [joe] ah, we go this. - Okay. [joe] hearing sam's story about being kicked out, I can relate to that feeling of rejection. I have to make sure I'm a little more understanding of her feelings. Uh, she's got a very different skill set than I, and mine obviously is a little more study-based, you know, and not so much, you know, hands-on. So I'm kind of stepping back a little bit, and I'm putting my faith in sam. [sam] all right. Just like building anything. It gets more stable the more you add on. We are going to make a windproof, waterproof shelter with a fireplace that allows smoke to exit. This is like my go-to winter shelter. What we plan on doing is four posts and running a crossbeam across the whole thing. We will be mudding the fire pit. It's basically a giant debris shelter and debris shelters are supposed to be the best in the cold. We're probably going to need around 50 trees today. [sam] super hot out right now. I'm getting burnt. Are you thirsty? -[joe] I am now. -[sam] you haven't had any water today. I've had, like, three pots. I think we just need to stay out of the sun. Do you want to take a minute? [joe] yeah. [exhales] this environment is so ridiculously tough. I mean, during the day, it's hot enough for the sun to burn you and for you to sweat. And at night it's cold enough to give you hypothermia. I just like am so worried 'cause, like if we don't have this done, we're screwed. What do you think? [joe] what I think is we might have porcupine. If you look straight between these two trees, something big was moving in those branches. [sam] great. What about the shelter? - Sorry. Right. - Porcupine means nothing. - Easily distracted. - What are we supposed to do with a porcupine? What is that going to do for us? Like you're... You're upsetting me. I don't understand like, where your head's at. We're going to freeze to death. [joe] this is all really frustrating. I know I can do better than this, but energy levels are going down and, well, tempers are going up. Like, why, dude? I, like, have no words for you right now. Unbelievable. When I'm out here, I change. Everyone should. You've got to know that if you don't fight, you won't make it. Everything in nature is a fighter. You know, nothing out here is easygoing. You can't be easygoing when you're starving. You can't be easygoing when you're freezing. You need to fight. Sam, I do appreciate your patience with me. One hundred percent. I appreciate the fact that you've been so cool with me. Seriously, I know that it can't be easy to have someone to basically be a bitch. We just need to get it done. Yep. [dramatic music playing] we're going to be warm, joe. [joe] I believe that. You sure you don't want to wait till day five and do our fifth shelter? [sam] look at that. Somebody's got jokes. [sam] it's really not too bad. I'm definitely warmer than I was last night. [joe exhales] I've got a little bit of sleep last night, thankfully. I don't know that we'd make it out here quite as well as we have, if it wasn't for sam's experience. [sam] our shelter did a decent job. - [joe] yeah. - [sam] it's just way too cold. At night, I mean, the temperature just drops. I would say it's a good 40-50 degrees. I don't know any human body that can adapt to that easily. [water flowing] it is going to rain. And it is going to suck. We're gonna... We're gonna get wet. I believe so. Yes. This rain is coming. Kind of get as much wood as we can possibly fit in the shelter and we're probably going to hunker down pretty soon. [thunder rumbling] do you hear that? [raindrops pattering] so here we go. Ow, what the... [bleep] [joe] holy [bleep]. We got hail. - Son of a... - [sam] oh, my god. There's ice cubes coming in. Oh, my [bleep]. [joe] look at how big that is. [sam] oh, my god. Whoa! This is a bad. I mean, like, look at that. That is coming in and hitting us. Holy... [bleep] oh, my god. [joe groans] [sam] oh, my god. - Wow! This is a... - Oh. What the [bleep]? [sam] oh... [bleep] look at it. There's ice all over the ground out there. [joe] that just got so much worse. [sam] this is so much worse. I'm like convulsing. [joe] oh, my god. [sam] I'm so cold. I can't get warm. This is bad. [joe] your skin is like ice. This is kinda the scary part. If we were to fall hypothermic, nobody would know till morning. [sam] this might be the end of our challenge. [sam sighing] - [joe] oh. - [sam] oh, my god. Oh, okay. [sam] from my knees down, I can't feel... [joe] I don't know. You stopped shaking a while ago. - [sam] did I? - [joe] yeah. [sam] it's too cold. [narrator] not shivering in the cold is a sign of moderate hypothermia, which happens when the body's core temperature drops below 90 degrees. With night temperatures threatening to remain unseasonably low, the producers send in the medic to check on the survivalists. [chris] what's going on? [joe] cramping is too much, and s-sam's not shivering so much anymore. -[chris] okay. -[sam groans] I can't move my toes. -[joe grunts] - [chris] sam's lower limb numbness is a first sign to pre-hypothermia and I can also see that joe is shivering uncontrollably. -[joe] I think we can do this. We still got this. -Okay. I know it's been really cold, but seeing the medic look that concerned... [chris] your blood pressure is a little low. Kind of uh... kind of concerning to me... [sam] ...Is kind of frightening. [phil] do you have concerns about the challenge? [chris] they're right on the verge of pre-hypothermic. I'm extremely concerned about their safety and their health and also about them completing the challenge. Thank you for letting me know. -[chris] sure. -[phil] we take this very seriously. May I speak with you and sam, please? What's going on? Due to the unexpected frigid temperatures, special dispensation has been made. We want to give you a chance to complete this challenge. [sam] oh, my gosh. [narrator] joe and sam are given two bison pelts. The same type used by the native blackfeet to survive in the rockies. [sam] oh, my gosh. We may not be cold. Oh, god. Just give that a feel. Oh, this is incredible. [chuckling] I'm so tired of being cold. It's just been so hard out here. It's like we can't even really start our challenge, we're just fighting the cold the whole time. [sam] oh, I'm so happy. We have a chance. We have a chance. Now, suddenly we can search for food. These two pelts could be game changing. You excited for some ear warmers? [joe] I really am. [sam chuckling] [sam] you can tell, it immediately starts warming your head. Yes. [sam] holy crap. First night with the pelts, I'm like, totally down to, like, cry out here 'cause it's like... I love it. [joe] today was a beautiful day. Good morning, montana! Yeah! - We're going to kill it, baby. - Ah! We got so much rest yesterday. [joe exhales] - whoo! - Well, that's one way to put it. Today we're getting food. Oh, look, look, do you see it? - Chipmunk. - [joe] I see a chipmunk. Hey, bud. We're going to eat you. Joe said that his strength is hunting, so hopefully he can get some kind of food source. [joe] never did this after seven days without food, it's going to be interesting. [grunts] [bleep] my accuracy is certainly not where it belongs to be. [sam] it's different when you're in a survival situation. All of your capabilities are cut in half. - How about instead of throwing another stick... -[joe] yeah. Do you want me to show you how to set up a good deadfall? - [joe] yeah. - [sam] and we'll get 'em. I've got a whole lot of book knowledge coming into this, but the practical application of it all, I'm still trying to learn. See, we want to get our hands charred up. And these too. I'm charring up all the sticks. -[joe] why is that? -So that you can hide your scent so that the animals will actually go near the trap. And we also need to char up the rocks. I genuinely feel like we have two different survival mentalities. I feel like he's done this a lot for fun. The only time I've ever done anything like this was when I absolutely had to. All right, let's do this. Got two pieces of flat long rocks, these are our guide sticks. These two will go on either side of the deadfall rock so that it kind of guides it in the right direction. And this short trigger stick. He'll come in and eat... Num-num-num-num... Squish. There's, like, literally no drop time. It's immediately killing them. Trap set. All right, let's see how my theory works out against practical application. Okay, uh, looking like a sampson deadfall. -[sam] sampson post. -[joe] sampson post. Okay. Sampson post. Is that yours? - Yeah. - Okay. Still trying to figure out the ratios on it. Yeah, I would say it's a little high. It's like a 70-degree angle. Mine's maybe a 30 to where the chipmunk actually has to go in and the second it starts moving things, - it's going to fall. - All right. I could certainly use a few tips. Again, I'm going based on drawings here. It very much concerns me that he doesn't seem like he really understands a lot of the basics. I hope I did right. Most of the things I've done before - up to this point were all... - [chittering] did you just knock over my trap? I did. I will set it right back up. It was completely my stupid mistake. Me being careless. It's a little hard to stay focused. We are very deprived. What's wrong with my original trigger stick? It's super, super sensitive and I keep knocking against the post. - I don't want to destroy it. - I know. It's supposed to be very, very sensitive. All right. I'll still try to work with that then. Just leave my trap alone. It's sensitive so that it would trip when a chipmunk touched it. Aren't we going for a chipmunk? Don't we want it to be really sensitive? Like, how violent do you think a chipmunk's going to come in here? There's just so many things that you do that just like... You're not lacking in knowledge, you're lacking in basic common sense. So I can't handle that. I understand sam's frustration with me, but you know, to be called out on your overall knowledge and what you're capable of that really hurts. Survival's hard enough. I don't want to be questioning my own self-worth. [sam] and then the char. You didn't know how to hide your scent. Again, a very different world we're coming from. -It's just, a lot of the stuff just doesn't... -in every world that you set a trap you cover your scent. - You don't touch anything. - Oh, god. Like, does that not make common sense that you should cover your scent when you trap? I don't know what to tell you right now. - Oh, my god. - You are so heated and pissed. I am so heated and pissed. You're right. I am out here with somebody who doesn't know anything! You don't know anything! [sam] you're a grown-ass man who decided to come on a survival challenge, who doesn't know [bleep] about survival. All you keep saying are excuses like, "it was cold. I couldn't think." what about me? I'm cold, and I can think. I cannot... - Let's just take some time off. -...Be partner with you. Okay. [sam speaking] like, I'm done. [joe] after yesterday, I'm looking to prove my worth out here. I can't be all talk. Bottom line... I really just want to show sam that I can do this. I am capable. I want her to be able to see us as equals. I'm gonna find something to eat. - Good luck. - Thanks. I think I'm going to explore a little bit. While I have any kind of energy whatsoever. I am so hungry. We've gone days now without really eating. I can tell my coordination's not quite as good. Tensions are high just because I'm stressed. It's definitely affecting thought processes. Kind of makes you emotional. There's gotta be food. [narrator] joe and sam have been burning up to 4,000 calories a day and have consumed nothing. Lack of food reduces the amount of glucose in the brain, causing changes in brain chemistry that can lead to increased mood fluctuations and intense negative emotional reactions. [joe] sam, she may try to act tough, but I know she's extremely hungry. She's getting a little weaker, definitely a lot more snappy. I really think that sam's a good person. This environment is just... It brings out the worst in you. [sam] ooh! Strawberries. Berry hunting is officially a forte of mine. I feel like sometimes you just forget I've actually had to do this to live. Oh, there's some more. Man, I'm on a roll. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. That was a lot of energy wasted. Feel like if I can get a decent amount in my bag, I can patty them, dry them and have food for the next couple of days. Just getting some clover just so that I can use it as kind of a filler in my cakes. Oh, god, that sun. My back is just on fire. Huckleberry strawberry mashy time. I have to get these mashed a soon as possible because I need them to be sun dried. Clover just kind of helps hold it all together. This will actually be really good. All right. Gonna let that dry. God. How does my shoulder look? [joe] you have bubbling going on. [sam] oh, good. Her skin is just like peeling off. It looks horrible. Look at my boobs. Shoulder... Yeah. I'm gonna climb in the shelter. I just got to get out of the sun. It's like destroying my back. Please. You have well-earned that rest. Don't worry about it, all right? Uh, gotta fortify our shelter more. Don't overdo yourself. I'm not. I'm good. I'm going at a nice slow pace. [grunts] [groans] I shouldn't have let myself get burnt. Water. - There you go. - Thank you. Joe has been so awesome today. He's really stepped it up and I love it. I just feel like I need to open up to him more instead of being such a bitch. Oh. Some grasshoppers. Nice little light snack. Pop their heads right off. Pull out all that goop. Pop them right in the bag. I scored four little grasshoppers, you want to have one today? They're good. If I see you eat one, I'll eat one. Okay. Happily. Let me get a fire going. [sam] have you ever eaten a grasshopper? [joe] I have. Just picture burnt popcorn. - Cheers. - Cheers. - I was really hoping he wouldn't go through with it. - Mm. Oh! Here you go, joe. I can't. Certainly won't give it up. Uh... Joe is crushing it today. He's finding grasshoppers, and it looks like he's really starting to enjoy himself. And I have a berry cake. He deserves it. It's not fair of me to be an... [bleep] I just felt like this was a nice peace offering. Thank you. Mmm, that is nice. It's a mix of raspberry strawberry, huckleberry. - I would buy that in a store. - It's pretty good. [joe] so she offers me up a little cake. You know, it was a beautiful peace offering. I think that's what we needed. This was something kind of special. It was very special. It was actually really nice. We should do it more. Here's to hoping it's the first of many. [sam] oh, sun! - Are you thirsty? - I'm good. -[sam] just remember, you haven't drank since... - Yeah, yesterday. [sam] yesterday evening. [sam] if you can get some berries, I can mash them into cakes, and we'll have berry cakes for a while. We could have, like a big lunch. [joe] I love that idea. It's kind of nice now that we've been able to divide up duties. We kind of stay out of each other's hair, so she doesn't have to worry about what I'm doing and vice versa. It really works out for the better. Oh, I need a minute. [exhales heavily] I really need something to drink. Oh, yeah. I need to sit down. I'm feeling really, really light-headed. Oh. [sighs] oh, wow, that came on suddenly. - [sam] joe, do you need help? - Mmm-hmm. Oh, my. I got to... [grunts and retches] I need to sit down. I'm feeling really, really light-headed. Oh. [sam] joe, do you need help? [sighs] oh, wow, that came on suddenly. [narrator] scorching days, freezing nights, and heated disagreements have left sam and joe's partnership on the brink. Joe! [narrator] having forgotten to drink since the night before, joe has suddenly collapsed. Oh, I feel dizzy. I need something to drink immediately. I figured. [retches] - [sam] you need some water? - [joe groans] [sam] this whole day, he hasn't drank anything. I'm really worried about him. [joe] oh, this doesn't feel right at all. Something's really wrong. Something's really wrong? I feel super dehydrated. It came on really quick. Do you? I need to call the medic. No, I just need water. [sam] I don't understand why he can't hydrate himself when there's a flowing water source right there. You need to drink. You're dehydrated. -Mmm-hmm. -And the longer you take to take that first drink, the more dehydrated you're gonna get, okay. I told him multiple times that he hadn't drank water. It's just really odd for me to have to tell a 40-year-old survivalist how to survive. This is the second time you've gotten like this in ten days. I got it. Yep. I just had to get past that first little wave. No, the feeling's passing. Nothing out here takes more priority than water. - Yup. - You'll die fastest without that. Yeah, you're right. I got careless. I need to rehydrate a lot. When you went hiking, you were gone all day. What if this would have happened? - I wouldn't be able to help you. - No. And then what? I just have to rest and just wait for my body to recover. You don't recover like that. You don't know how dehydration works. That's not how it works. Once you've hit the point where you're on the ground, you're hours away from things starting to shut down. Like, joe, you can die. I feel like it was just a combination of a bunch of things. Maybe it's just the nutrition factor. I mean, I'm not really taking in a whole lot. Stop being stubborn. You need to drink if you don't drink... I'm not bringing you water anymore. I'll let you [bleep] die. - Fine. - Like, I'm over it, joe. Like, I have tried to help you. When is the gravity of this situation gonna hit you? Can you please get out of the sun? Either that or tap out, joe, 'cause you don't belong here. Like, I'm done, okay? So either you need to tap out or get the [bleep] out of the sun. Going back through how it happened, in the sequence, I'm questioning whether or not it was dehydration, okay? Then give me the [bleep] water. - Yes, it was... for god's sakes. - Obviously you don't need it. Awesome. And I'll put the fire out that I just got going, too. I've tried so many things to get through to him, and I don't know how. All right. [sighs] look, you're standing up now after getting some water. So was it dehydration? Sam, I don't want to argue with you. I don't know. I have no idea. Admit that I'm right, and that you were dehydrated. I was dehydrated. Okay, I needed water. I'm literally babysitting a 40-year-old man. You're an adult. You're thirsty? Get some [bleep] water. All right, sam. I'm just really, really just tired of arguing with you. For god's sakes. [sam] what a [bleep] idiot. [joe] there's no sense in arguing with her, so I told her exactly what she wanted to hear. [sam] oh, suddenly I'm not dehydrated. I only drank a pot of water and feel great. I hate conflict. And that just makes it even worse out here. Can you just do me a favor and listen to me? - Yeah. - Thank you. Get out of the sun. Like I'm not being nice about it anymore. I'm giving you orders. Until either you break and go home, or you break and get good at this. It would be easier for me if he left. [sam] he's so stubborn and denies logic. I really struggle being around people like that. In fact, I don't even know if I've ever met anyone like that, except for 16-year-old me, and my father, like that's it. I'm not boiling your water anymore, dude. You're just standing in the sun. [joe] I keep pacing back and forth. - It's too cold to just stand... - You're so right. You're always right, joe. What, do I just hang out in the shade just to appease her now? That seems really childish. I don't know where in the world her head is. At this point, I just need to remove myself from the situation completely. Just take a walk. I absolutely hate who I am as a person when I'm around this man. That's not who I am. That's never been who I am. But I can't be around him. I just can't. [grunts] [joe] not finding a whole ton of berries right now, so I may have to move on to a little different ground. She has such a negative attitude. Comparing this to babysitting? It's absolutely delusional. Huh. Oh, my god. [laughs] that's the most raspberries I think I've ever seen. Oh, this is beautiful. I stumbled on the side of a frigging raspberry mountain, for all I know. There are easily thousands upon thousands of raspberries up here. Okay, my little quest for some peace and quiet ended up... Uh, let's just say it's been very fruitful. This has given me one hell of a moral dilemma. You know, after this morning, do I really want to share these? Realistically, I mean, I'd be set if this is all I wanted for the rest of the time. But I'm not going to change who I am. I'm at least gonna offer. - You awake, sam? - What's up? Well, I found something. I figured it would interest you. I have half to three quarters of a pint of raspberries, and I got a whole bunch of leaves. I was gonna brew up some tea in a little bit. - If you would like something. - I don't want anything. If I eat those berries, he's gonna think that everything's fine, and it's not. I know I'm being prideful right now, but his actions remind me of how my dad used to be, where he had it in his head, what was right and what was wrong because in his mind, he knows best. This is one of the reasons why I ended up homeless, because I refuse to bow to anyone's ignorance. Like, you guys don't understand how exhausting it is, mentally and emotionally, to be in this position with somebody who doesn't think further than his nose. I came back with a huge, huge quart of raspberries, but somehow a kind gesture just turned into, "now you're taking all my food." [joe] I don't know what to do with this woman. Ten days of non-stop argument. That's what I get to look forward to. [joe speaking] no, I don't. I really just kind of want to do our own thing from here on out. [joe speaking] come on in. [sam] what you doing? You're like literally straddling me with your arms. Get off me, bro. [joe] I could not get over. [joe] all right, last question, - and I'll leave you alone. -[sam] I literally don't want to speak to you. [joe] how do you want to split the blankets? I don't give a [bleep] what you do. I 'm gonna make sure I'm warm. [joe] all right, well, I'm going to grab the bottom of it. You're on half of my blanket. I don't give a [bleep] I really don't know how to approach this right now, - 'cause you're so angry. - Yeah. I am angry, and you don't understand why. Isn't that crazy? So when are you tapping out? [joe speaking] look, he sounds like a wounded puppy. And if you want to split resources, joe, this is my shelter. Get the [bleep] out of my shelter. [sam] this is my shelter. Joe, get out. [joe] I helped build some of this, too. What, like ten branches and the mud you put on it? Bro, I'll kick down this fireplace and you can have a good night. If you'll let me use the machete tomorrow, I will start building my own. [sam] honestly, I don't feel like you did very much soul-searching today. I heard you get, like... You were literally over there, laughing. You didn't think at all about what happened earlier. [joe speaking] [sam speaking] [joe] but that's not how it ended up being. You're actually a really awful human being. [joe scoffs] you really are a terrible person, joe. - Like I knew I couldn't trust you. - Okay. [sam sobs] like I can't believe I'm stuck here with such an evil human being. I'm literally stuck in the woods with the devil. [sobbing] [sam] all right. Sunlight's in the shelter. Get out. [joe] happily. [sam] when you're out, exposed like this, you really find out who the real you is, and fast. And sometimes that scares you. Damn. But would you rather be in denial or know the truth? [joe] now, I've got to make my own shelter. [sighs] I'm getting some rocks together right now to try and make at least a small little fire pit. [joe] after last night, I have no sympathy left. It was just horrible. Sam has absolutely lost her mind. Like, how do I deal with this? Everything she's doing is so [bleep] malicious. I feel at this point she's just trying to set me up for failure or to be removed. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. It makes me want to finish this even more. [sam] I begged joe to tap out last night. Begged [laughs] he didn't [laughs] it's just very frustrating to me. 'cause survival's definitely not my problem. It's people. This is where I belong. [whoops] the fresh air, the beautiful breeze, the sun, the stars, this is it for me. I don't know. He's, uh, his refusal to tap has, uh, basically brought me to tap. I know I can do this alone, but not with him. [sam] all right, joe. - So you win, bro. - I win? Yeah, I'm tapping out today. [sam] still as a teammate, he can't talk to me. Last night was absolutely horrific. I mean, what do you want me to tell you? You still don't get it. And that's why I have to get out. And it is mentally destroying me. At least I set you up for success, joe. You don't have to do anything else. Just know, when you finally complete this challenge, you still didn't do it on your own. [joe speaking] I'll know I did this. And I earned this, despite what anyone else says. [crying softly] what's going on, sam? Uh, I need to tap out. I need to leave this challenge. Working with him is like, really damaging me, mentally. It's literally the exact same feeling when I got kicked out, because the person I was supposed to be able to trust, no matter what, let me down. And here I am again, with the only person I'm supposed to be able to trust, letting me down. You understand, by leaving, that's final, your challenge will be over? There's no coming back from this. I do. My mental health means more than the challenge, unfortunately. [narrator] the harsh conditions of the montana wilderness and sam's inability to work with her partner have forced her to leave the challenge. Her psr drops from 6.8 to 5.4. [sam] my first survival experience, I don't have anyone to trust. I don't have anyone to let me down but myself. In a way, that made me an incredibly strong person out here. My survival skills are on point, but that's a long time to rely on yourself at a very young age. I almost wonder if maybe being alone for eight months in the woods affected my ability to work well with people, or to just let things go. This isn't the first time somebody just straight-up left and abandoned me. This time it's a little different, though. It really would kind of taste of a lie if I didn't say I wasn't happy about it. Deep down, I still believe sam's a good person. I really hope she finds some peace. Nobody needs to be that high-strung. All right. [joe speaking] nine more nights of this. There's no way around it. Being out here alone, I got one hell of a task ahead of me. I got to figure out how to source my own food, I got to be able to get firewood, I got to be able to process water. It's just me. I don't need anything this big. It's time for new beginnings. And I have absolutely no intent on ever getting back in this damn thing. There's a lot of bad mojo in this shelter. Burn the [bleep] to the ground. Time to build a home. It's definitely gonna work out better. Just do with a basic lean-to. I found a nice cluster of rocks in the area. So that's gonna end up being my reflector wall for the fire pit. Have the frame behind it, keeping as much heat as I can, in. I think between the fire and the pelts, I got a good chance of staying warm tonight. [sam] it's my night one, uh, of going solo. Got that lovely little rock back there. It's kicking heat at me. It is pretty cool. I don't know what to expect tonight. It's gonna be cold. I won't have anyone here, no one to help keep me warm, no one to help ward off predators. And no one to call me stupid. [laughs] hey. Hey. [joe speaking] [joe] it is the morning of day 12. I'm still here. I'm still very much in this. I just, I can't quit. Cannot quit. The survivalist gave up. And the backyard camper is still here. I may not be as skilled as some. But I definitely pride myself on the mental game. You know, despite what sam felt, I should be here. It's just really what I've been kinda dreaming of. You know, proving my own worth. They're not pretty, but... I think they're gonna be functional. Oh, cool. It doesn't hurt to walk. I got shoes. [laughs] oh, this is so cool. I probably look absolutely ridiculous. I don't even care. [laughs] oh, my god. [sighs] morning of day 14. Uh, wow, my hair's doing something funky. [sighs] a week to go in the challenge. I got a lot of work to do today. Oh, [bleep]. What is that? We got scratch marks. Whatever this might be is... Bigger than me. Fifty yards from camp, we got big old bear scratches into the wood. Ooh, that is wicked. I knew there were bears out here, but nothing quite hits home like actually seeing claw marks that close to camp where you sleep. Great. Uh... Got a really blonde looking hair. Uh, that means grizzlies. It's really unnerving. It's one of those times I really, really wish I had a partner. As good as I feel about my shelter, if something really wants to get in there, they're just branches. You know, it'll tear right in. It doesn't matter. So, my best defense has got to be the fire. I have to have it keep going. So, I have to get a lot more firewood than I've had before and really prepare for a long night. I'll have to keep the fire extra high. Doing whatever I can just kind of keep predators away. Holy [bleep]. The shelter's on fire. Oh, god. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't you do that. Oh, [bleep]. Come on. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No. Come on. [bleep] holy [bleep]. Oh, hell, the shelter's on fire. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't you do that. Oh, god. [bleep] come on. One little ember. It's getting borderline out of control. No, no, no, no. This wood is so dry now. That ought to get the blood pumping. Oh, what a [bleep] night. That was truly terrifying. This challenge really takes everything out of you. One thing after another. I just, I don't feel like I can win. [laughs] this place will just keep beating you down. It's crazy. Absolutely crazy. I gotta go check out my trap. [sighs] ah, not so lucky. Oh, don't stop. Don't stop. You know you need food. Energy levels are really down. I don't ever recall ever feeling quite this weak. Ow! Ow, ow, ow! The lack of nutrition really, really is... It's awful. Now that he fat reserves are gone, now my body's gonna start breaking out some muscle tissue. This current bush is just about picked clean. [sighs] this sucks. Food is dwindling, and I need it. Extraction's coming up so quickly. Oh, crap. More raspberry plants... With no raspberries. I know there's a bear out here, at least one. And... Frankly, I think he's in the same competition for food that I am. [thunder rumbling] oh, [bleep]. [sighs] it really is terrifying thinking about hypothermia out here. [sighs] oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. No rain, please. Please, no rain. If that means rain, I'm in such trouble. [grunts] I need to find some more firewood. Oh, that's chilly. I hope it sure as hell doesn't hail again. Frozen temperatures, ice balls, getting wet, I've never been that cold. I don't ever want to be at that state again. [thunder rumbling] oh, no. Oh, my god, that is so cold. Hah. [breathing heavily] I can't take the cold. Since sam's left, being out here alone without being able to snuggle up to somebody without their body heat... [sobbing] ...It's truly terrifying. [sobbing] [shivering] it's so cold. The fire has went completely out this place is trying to break me down. I know it is. I just... I can't quit. I won't quit. [breathing heavily] you hear me, I won't quit. Last night was horrendous. Montana has not been a nice place. This cold is crippling. But it's nice how fast these rocks heat up. They really do radiate a lot. Last night, I had some really, really... [grunts] ...Concerning moments. But... But I'm here. This place didn't beat me yet. All right. The fire might go out but I got to get food. It's absolutely a mental game out here. When you get inside your own head, I think that's where you start to fail. I hate to say it, but I feel like maybe that is what happened to my partner. What the hell is that? Oh, wow. Nice little froggies. Oh, there's a bigun. [gasps] this is gonna be cold, but you know what? Any opportunity for food. That's just where I am. [breathing heavily] it's cold. I just gotta be careful. Really, really have to be mindful of the hemlock out here. Okay, here we go. Here we go. [breathing heavily] I see a few already. Okay. Oh, don't loose them, please. All right, you know what, that's not gonna work. [grunts] come on, you little bastards. [grunts] it's cold. Oh, you know what? No, I can't. I'm not chasing him in a hemlock. Absolutely not worth the risk. [exhales] I see you. Yeah. You are not getting away. I'm gonna eat the [bleep] out of you. Okay, so, what I came back with is.. Seven frogs. I guess this is, this is... I'm gonna call this my first real meal out here. It's pretty cool. Sam insisted I couldn't do anything out here. Well... Surprise. Yeah, the old guy still got it. These are completely gutted. Let's flip these little guys. It tastes like victory. [laughs] yeah, dude. You know... It remind me of seaweed. Mm-hm. Mm. Definitely don't taste like chicken. I needed this so badly. It's like with every bite, it just... It feels like just a touch of life returning to me. Cleaned my plate, bones and all. Holy [bleep]. An adolescent bull moose. [yells] thirty, thirty five feet away. - [moose bellows] - [yells] get! Get! Go! Definitely getting close, and I'm full on panic mode. Get! Go! Aggressive bull like that, you know, just packed full of testosterone... [yells] ...Could kill me effortlessly. I see you. Get out of here! - Hah! Come on! Get! - [moose bellows] [samantha] oh, my gosh. [joe] wow, that pelt is huge. I basically feel like a pimp. Yeah, I just need a cane now. Uh, stop. Feel like working? [snickers] I just want you to know that I always keep an open mind, and I'm struggling with a naked man... On bear pelts. [laughs] whoa... Don't worry, mom. I'll make you proud. [laughs] - mm... - [both laugh] [overlapping chatter] - I wanna flip. - [sighs] [joe yells] - [moose bellows] - [yells] yah! Get! Get! [yelling] yah! Get! Get the [bleep] out of here. This is my camp! Stay out! Damn right. Woo, my heart's racing. I don't think I've made that much noise since I've been here. That was insane. He must have been a good 1,000 to 1,200 pounds. He's a really, really big animal. [chuckles] ah, okay, I gotta... I gotta breathe. [laughs] that was nuts. Wow. Here he is. Look how deep that is. I can only hope I don't encounter him again. Just for a moment, while I stood up... Just a little, little dizzy. [narrator] over the past 18 days, joe has burned well over 70,000 calories and consumed barely 1,000. My energy has really just sapped. I know extraction's coming. I need something substantial to eat all right, let's see what we got today. This seems pretty... Inactive. There's nothing at the frog pond, so things are starting to feel a little dire right now. - [low growl] - [joe] hey. Hey. That was definitely a cat. [clanging] get me out of here, please. [clanging continues] it is extraction day. Can you believe that? As soon as I get out of here... I know that I am worth something. I did this and I did it on my own. I'm ready to go. It's just... I don't know if you could see this. It is quite cold out here, and I'm not gonna have my pelt when I do my extraction. That's extra weight I just don't need. I know this extraction hike's really gonna be tough. The montana wilderness, this is really intimidating. I still that bear's still in the area. That's it, time to go. All right. [sighs] I can't go up on the banks, there's hemlock everywhere you look. Looks like... I got to get in the water. [narrator] in order to complete his 21-day challenge, joe faces a grueling two mile hike down river through frigid waters surrounded by poisonous hemlock. Once clear of the river, he must travel three miles through pine forests and grasslands, staying vigilant to avoid venomous prairie rattlesnakes and grizzlies who's paws are powerful enough to kill a human with a single strike. Finally, he will have to ascend another tortuous mile over razor sharp thistle without any protection from the intense sun to reach his extraction point. [exhales] okay. Here we go. Ooh, that's chilly. Oh, that is really painful. [grunts] I got this. A couple hours. A couple hours. Ow! [grunts] everything's so darn slippery. Everything's just covered in green moss. [low growl] I hope that's not a bear. A big mountain lion, I don't know. Oh, god. It doesn't look like I have a safe way to get back on the bank without getting all sorts of hemlock. It's forcing me in here. I gotta keep pushing on. Ow. I'm moving... [grunts] ...About a mile an hour. Every little thing, every little step is just... Oh, it just makes my toes numb. The sun's beating down on my back, I'm freezing and I'm burning. I need to get out of this water. This looks clear enough. [exhales] oh, baby. Dry land. Very excited to get my shoes back on. I'm so glad I made these. Now, unfortunately, I'm in the area of predators again. Hey, bear... Person coming through. Keep being loud. Do not surprise an animal. Hey, bear. Man, I've never been this far away from camp. All sorts of fun stuff hiding in the grass. I'm now into venomous snake territory. A snake bite at this point, I could very well lose a limb, if not my life. This makes me really, really uncomfortable. Oh, [bleep]. I gotta get out of this grass. I kind of hope that's the hill. Feels like I've been walking forever. [grunts] this is... Absolutely brutal. I don't have a lot of energy right now, but I can't quit. I don't care if I have to crawl up this hill. I gotta get to extraction... And that... That's something no one... No one can ever take away from me. [panting] I have to... I'm so grateful for shoes right now. I feel so weak. [grunts] [low growl] I still got his. I still got this. Oh, montana, you're a son of a bitch. You're not gonna beat me. [pants] the cold... Blistering sun... Ice balls... [bleep] ah! [grunts] son of a bitch. Yeah, screw you, too, montana. [grunting, panting] there's nothing stopping me. I think I hear something. - [horn beeping] - oh, dear god. Oh, there it is. [grunts, pants] [bleep] [panting] [laughs] oh. [panting] oh, thank you, lord. Thank you, lord. [pants] oh, my god. I'm going home. Oh, lord. Don't ever... Ever let anyone tell you... That something you love is stupid. Or that it's a bad idea. Twenty-one amazing days. I did this. Me. No one can ever take that away from me. When I first started this journey, I was a very, very different person. I was completely clueless, but I kept pushing just to try and find a solution. I never stopped. I've proved my worth 10 times over, as far as I'm concerned. I know my self-worth. I know my value. [narrator] after 20 freezing nights and 21 scorching days in the mountains of montana, joe lost a total of 30 pounds. Despite his lack of practical experience, he displayed extreme mental toughness. His primitive survival rating rises from a 6.5 to a 7.0. [joe] oh, sam, I wish you were here, I do. This is every bit part of your moment. Sam taught me quite a lot about myself. I'm leaving this challenge confident, I'm proud of myself and I've got a great feeling of self-worth. So, I thank her for it. I just did 21 days!
