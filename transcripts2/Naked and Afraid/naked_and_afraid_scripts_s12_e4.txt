 Last, uh, sunset in san diego, hanging out with the crew, the girlfriend, the dog. I'll be heading out tomorrow. [rebecca] I am gonna miss you. You're already starting to cry. [chuckling] I know. Aw. [holly] this is our trail run. I am naked. [laughs] I don't know. Just take my word for it.

 Yeah. I hate it. [laughs] [intense music playing] [holly] this forest is crazy-looking. I'm not used to anything that's going on out here. All kinds of poisonous things. [jake] it's absolutely gorgeous here. Coming from san diego, it's pretty brown. It's super green. It's gonna be rainy. Just sitting there naked, it's gonna be really hard to ignore, so that's probably the thing I'm most nervous about. [narrator] on the southern tip of the appalachians

 is sand mountain, georgia. Hidden under the dense green canopy are 480-million-year-old cliffs of sandstone and sharp slate. One of only four temperate rainforest of the united states, it gets pounded by 66 inches of rain per year. [holly] I think I'm most nervous about trying to sleep in a wet and cold situation. And then we're gonna have to really be on the lookout for poisonous snakes. [narrator] sand mountain's rocky terrain is home to nine kinds of venomous snakes, including copperheads and rattlesnakes, while black bears and mountain lions use the thick brush to stalk their prey. [intense music playing] [jake] there's a lot of thoughts going through my mind. Excited, nervous, anxious, everything, all wrapped up into one. It's a lot of emotions to process right now. Growing up in iowa, I've always been around hunting, with traps, with snares, fishing. Did a lot of camping trips. One of my favorite things to do is make my own tree house, or my own shelter, or my own lean-to. Become an eagle scout when I was 14. It was the first time I ever survived alone out in the wilderness. I'd like to approach everything in my life knowing that I have control of the situation. High school went without drinking alcohol when everybody else started drinking. Got to college. Went abstinence for sex for almost two years because the more you can push yourself and stretch yourself, the more than you can grow and understand yourself. You know, coming in here, ultimately, it's just gonna be a mental game. And, mentally, I think I can fight through anything. Lots of wood, a lot of resources available to me, so there's gonna be a lot to do out here. I've lived in san diego for 16 years now. I have a great job. I have an amazing girlfriend. Live a great life. It kind of makes things a little boring at times. Hopefully, coming out of this, I could figure out if where I'm at and what I'm doing is what's right for me, and if there's another opportunity or passion that could drive me to something better. [narrator] jake comes into the challenge confident and looking to shake up his comfortable life. But his need to control his environment may hinder his ability to adapt. He begins with a primitive survival rating of 7. 0. [holly] my name is holly. I'm from mccall, idaho. And I'm an environmental educator. This environment is really different from where I live. It's a lot denser, a lot wetter. Really wet. [chuckles] I describe myself as just a regular old mountain man. Any opportunity that I can to be outside, I'll take it. Where I live, it gets below zero pretty often, like negative twenties, six feet of snow. So I'm like extreme weather-acclimated, really good at fire-building. Just doing like a little tiny fire in here. Get it nice and warm. Shelter-building, I've been working on. And then plant identification, I've been doing my whole life. I think my biggest weakness that I'm looking to overcome is my self-doubt. I didn't think to describe myself as a survivalist until probably this year. But I've been practicing and training the hard survival skills my whole life. I'm here to conquer the voice of doubt in my head. I wanna prove to myself that I can do anything because, more often than not, it's me in the back of my own mind saying, "you can't do this." [narrator] holly's extensive knowledge of plants and fire-building will be her greatest asset in a brutal environment, but her insecurities may paralyze her ability to make quick decisions. Her primitive survival rating is 6. 8. [holly] I'm nervous and I think that it's just gonna be a matter of putting one foot in front of the other and recognizing that things are out of my comfort zone but being okay with it. [intense music playing] here we are. Game on. [chuckles] I don't like the idea of tapping out in any regard. If my partner doesn't make it, I have the fortitude to make it through on my own. I am confident I'm gonna survive this challenge. It's getting real. [holly] I'm definitely feeling nervous about being naked in front of a stranger. I'm just gonna do my best to keep my eyes in appropriate spot. But I think I might throw up. Maybe. A little bit. A little bit of throw up. [laughs] all right. Let's do this thing. Georgia, here I come. [intense music playing] [man screams] there's nothing easy about this. [woman screams] [man] we got hail. [thunder rumbles] [growls] get out. [man sighs] my heart's racing. [woman] you don't fight, you won't make it. [woman groans] life's so hard. [man] this is insane. [intense music playing] [jake] look at this place. It's absolutely amazing. Wow. It's gorgeous. [chuckles] - [jake] hello. - [holly] oh. - Hello, naked man. - [laughter] - I'm jake. - Jake, I'm holly. Hi. - Nice to meet you. - [holly] nice to meet you. He's pretty cute, so, um, it won't be bad to look at. - Where you from? - [holly] I'm from idaho. - [jake] idaho. - I'm from idaho. - Where you from? - [jake] I'm iowa. So I'm sure, uh, confusion all the time. [holly] it's true. It's true. - Tell me about your skills. - [jake] my skillset? So really know about... A lot of woodworking, crafting, so stuff like that. How about you? Those are actually my weak points, so that's my awesome. And, um, I'm really good with fire 'cause I have lived in a snowy environment - for my whole life. - Awesome. [holly] and then plant identification and foraging. [holly] I heard that's hard. So we will be the yin and yang. [holly] sounds like we're gonna mash well. [jake] yes. I agree. I agree. [jake] awesome. Let's check out the bags. [narrator] holly and jack have each brought a personal item, a machete and a fire starter, and they have been given a pot to boil water. - I also have a map... - [jake] all right. ...Here that we could look at. Okay. So it looks like we're starting up here. [holly] yup. And then, um, looks like there's some good resources down here. We got some fish. We got some plants. We definitely wanna avoid the dangers of the hilly mountainside. - Looks like that's poison ivy. - Yeah. [jake] some mountain lions and bobcats. So look for that cool little waterfall. Yeah. And then we're starting from right here, so let's just take the river down. [jake] okay. Shall we head out 'cause we're burning daylight? - [holly] yeah. Let's hit it. - All right. Let's go. Look at all the... - Some sharp rocks. - Yeah. Some very sharp rocks. [jake] after meeting my partner, I'll tell you, the 21 days seem extremely doable. She's very energetic. She seems ready to go. I think we can make this a really good situation. Tell you what, you're just all about just going for it. It's pretty impressive. Just bright, young thing. [holly] um, are you married? Kids? I am not married and I do not have kids, but I've been with my girlfriend, rebecca, for almost two years now, so... [holly] nice. That's a long time. [jake] yeah. I'm gonna miss her. She's definitely my best friend so it's gonna be hard not to say, "hey, guess what we did today." right? Watch out for snakes. [jake] oh, yeah. I guess I should... [narrator] camouflaged in the brush is the world's largest rattlesnake, the eastern diamondback, which can draw up to eight feet long. Its fangs can inject four times the dose of venom needed to kill a human. [intense music playing] [holly] so looks like we're coming up on that waterfall - that we're looking... - Oh, from the map? Right. Yeah. Cool. How do you wanna attack it? Let's just jump. Yeah. [jake] yeah. I don't know about... Let's jump. Let's do it. I don't know, man. I think I might have to pass on that one. You're a little more courageous than me. Let's test the waters a little bit here. See how deep it is, yeah. Toss some rock. I mean, I think we're all right. I don't see anything. - [holly] I'm gonna do it. - You are? I am. - [holly] yeah. - You first? Me first? - Same time? - Go at the same time? Yeah. Just live for the moment. One, two, three. [water splashes] [jake speaking] [jake] holly's really cool. Jumping in the water was definitely really good teambuilding. Gave us that opportunity to do something together as a... As a unit. So it's a great start. Really good start. That was awesome. Definitely don't wanna drink this water - without purifying it, but... - [holly] right. I think this is it. - Oh, the bend to the left? - Yeah. We gotta find a place to... Put up camp. Maybe more in the woods here. I think maybe like a sunny spot. Yeah, 'cause if it starts to rain, I don't know if I wanna right next to this water. [holly] right. [jake] I hate to have water come in on us. Holly, right over there to your right, nice barren, - quite open area. - Oh, hey. Look at that. Yeah. It's looking good. [jake] I think that is a great spot. No trees to cut down. There is potential for rain over the next few weeks, so I'll definitely need something that's gonna be waterproof, something that's gonna be on higher elevation. - This could be home. - [holly] yeah. I'm into it. - All right. So, - let's do it. [holly] I got some rocks. So I was thinking it'd be a good idea to elevate our fire so when it does rain, it's gonna get wet quick so I wanna make sure that our fire is pretty safe. [jake] I like it, holly. So this is gonna be... Uh, the top part of the a-frame, start to get something just maybe a little lean-to tonight. [holly] I think that might do us for tonight. - Oh, that's beautiful. - [holly] good forest. You wanna think about starting that fire? - [holly] yeah, I am. - Full faith in you. [mumbles] [indistinct] [holly] just a little wet. [jake] and it is definitely a little damp. [holly] perfect. Got it. All right. [bleep] yeah. [laughs] - [bleep] yeah. - [laughs] [jake] setup camp, we get fire started, a great partner, knowledgeable, resourceful. If this isn't a picture-perfect great start. Feeling awesome about our first day? Pretty successful so far so let's see how the nighttime goes. [thunder rumbles] [intense music playing] [jake] [bleep] the rain! [jake speaking] night one, I'm disappointed in myself for not making a more of an elaborate structure. The fire pit got a little wet but we are able to move it, now it is in this structure with us, dry. - [holly speaking] - [jake] burning. Now, the wood is gonna be wetter out here. [thunder rumbles] [jake speaking] I'm tired. Shelter is flooded. [holly speaking] [jake] I'm completely soaked. [jake speaking] [jake speaking] [thunder rumbles] [jake speaking] [holly] yeah. Look at that. Cool. [jake speaking] - [holly] [bleep] the state. - [jake] [bleep] georgia. [holly speaking] we were sitting in an inch of water in our shelter last night and it's just been a struggle to keep the fire and I did not sleep at all last night. So it keeps going like this, I don't think we're gonna get a lot of sleep. [jake] no way is that possible. I mean, it's almost torture just laying and having these drips fall on you - every few seconds. - [holly] yeah. [jake] last night was much harder than what I expected. The agony of sitting there for nine, ten hours, soaking wet and shivering. I realize that I had no control over anything. And my expectations of coming in here and just kicking ass and taking names went out the window. Figure we'll make a little spot on the side for the fire, - cover that up. - [holly] yeah. [jake] what do you think, uh, what else we could put on there to reinforce it so the rain doesn't come through? Let's see what those moss mats do, maybe. Oh, yeah. We should probably dig up some moss. Kind of looking out like a a-frame structure with some debris shingling, if you will. The idea is that the water settles on the leaves condenses to a droplet that hits the woods and then runs down the wood and not on us. [holly] I'm collecting moss, to plugs on the holes on our ceiling right now, just trying to keep the fire safe, keep the fire going. I mean I think, like, my worst fear right now is to have the fire go out and for it to be the middle of the night while it's still doing that [bleep] 21 days with rain pouring in, wet, cold, like, that seems absolutely daunting. I feel fear and I feel stressed, but all those emotions have to be in a little box because I'm not gonna think about that. [jake] if you own that little area right there, it's... That's like right above the fire. So, that's perfect. - Is it helping? - [jake] yeah, it is. - It is for sure. - Cool. [holly] if we don't get this live poplar to dry out and burn for us, we might be looking at a real firewood shortage here. I don't think this is gonna light up at all. This might just be our 21 days. - It could. - It could. [thunder rumbles] [narrator] in wet conditions, hypothermia can begin to set in even in 60-degree weather. [holly speaking] [jake speaking] this is crazy. It's crazy amount of rain. It's just gotten really flipping cold. [jake speaking] fire is the most important thing right now. We stay awake but, um, [jake speaking] [thunderclaps] [jake speaking] I just don't wanna get like hypothermia or just have to sit here shivering cold and wet all night. [holly speaking] [jake speaking] [holly speaking] [jake] you are a tougher person. Dude, you've done so much. You helped me build this shelter. You built a fire. You're a tougher person, trust me. [holly] I don't wanna do this on my own. Can you just try to stay till the morning? [thunder claps] literally, last night was the worse night I've ever had in my entire life. [holly speaking] [jake] I mean I agree with you. There's a certain triumph in struggle, but at the same time it's, like, you got to enjoy the process and everything. I miss my girlfriend more than anything. I'm filled with regret for leaving her. I don't like being uncomfortable. I don't like people watching me try something if there's a possibility that I'm gonna fail. Everything in me is just saying, like, go home. There's so much more comfort, so much more security, but holly is so determined. I know how much it means to her. Even talking about... Quitting last night, she started crying. She said she wouldn't be able to do without me. I know she would. [holly] I appreciate you being here. That means the absolute world to me. I'm very committed to finishing the 21 days and, like, I don't wanna be alone. I am putting so much effort right now into helping him maintain an emotional state. I'm trying to convince him to stay because, you know, I need him. I need the team. [holly speaking] yeah, for sure. And I think ultimately, seeing how much this means to her and how much it would just destroy her for me to walk away, it's, like, I might as well hang in there as much as I can. Oh, yeah. Should we, uh... Maybe try to find some breakfast? Yeah. Let's check out that pond. I came in here thinking what having survival skills was what makes or breaks you, but, really, it's just like mental toughness. [holly] holy [bleep]. [jake] what did you say? Jake. - [jake] oh, my [bleep]. - I know. [narrator] one bite from a cottonmouth snake releases enough hemotoxic venom to kill a human. [holly] I need to go split a stick. - Yeah. - Try to pin that thing down. I don't know if we chop its head off. Shall we? That is a meaty young guy. There, you see its head? His head's right there. To the right. To the right. [suspenseful music playing] oh, man. [suspenseful music playing] [jake] holly. You see its head? His head's right there. To the right. To the right. There's the head. [suspenseful music playing] [jake] now, get it. Hold it down. You got it? Good. Good. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Got it. Got it. Hell, yeah. Yes, holly. Good eyes. Head is off. [holly] thank you, snake. [chuckles] thank you for sleeping right here, snake. Okay. Breakfast? [jake] let's do it. Team work for the win. Snake breakfast. [jake] I know it's snake but in my mind, I'm hearing two pieces of bacon hitting the hot pan. [holly] oh, my god. Don't talk about bacon. [chuckles] [jake] I couldn't imagine having a better prepared mentally, physically, psychologically partner than holly. She's been... She's been killing it. Cheers? [laughs] cheers. [tense music playing] very good. Yeah. It's very, very mild fishy. [holly] yeah. [jake] after such a rough night, this was just a blessing. That was so amazing. I'm feeling a little more confident, feeling more focused. I need to step up and be a team player. I'm in it to win it now. [indistinct] another bottle of red, please. [holly laughing] [intense music playing] [jake] the rain has stopped. So today's focus will be the, uh, structure. Rebuild it, make it flatter and put more moss on, put these sticks close together. Rain is the biggest hurdle because it prevents us from sleeping. And if you're not sleeping well, everything else goes [bleep] so... What we'll end up doing is bark underneath, then moss, and a little bit of like mud and dirt will help kind of hopefully solidify it a bit more as to the overarching plan. [intense music playing] [holly] I think we're killing it as a team. We're getting good at the divide and conquer. We're playing to our strengths. And my strength is forging and jake is usually working on the structure. [laughs] I found chanterelles. [tense music playing] oh, my god. There's so many. Mushroom being started for me when I was a little kid and I would go out with my grandpa and look for morel mushrooms. That's how I got into it. And then, from there, I just started branching out. [chuckles] there's only, like, four or five that I can positively id and tell you that they're safe to eat but it's enough. I accidentally found more food. [chuckles] [tense music playing] [jake] enhance the shelter. Try to cover up as all the holes as possible. Uh, did a shelter doorway to prevent wind from blowing in. So now, it is really warm in there. We'll see how it feels tonight but it should be pretty good. You can get a little doorway. It works. That's cool. [intense music playing] so I'm moving these rocks, I'm seeing something kind of shiny and I think... Check this guy out. Wow. I mean, I think, this is a big chunk of coal. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look at that break off. That's stick, that's got to be cool. That's a big one. [narrator] the limestone cliffs and rocks in the area contained veins of compressed organic matter which over hundreds of millions of years have turned into coal. Because it is denser than wood, coal will burn much longer. [holly] oh, my gosh. There's a bunch over here. We are kind of struggling for firewood right now. So if we have this coal, it's just a... It's an alternate resource and then will make it easier for us to stay warm. Yes. Coal. [tense music playing] [jake speaking] chanterelles [jake] what are those for? This is edible mushroom. And I've got some coal. [jake] dude, that is sick. [laughs] sometimes it's good knowing stuff about mushrooms. [tense music playing] [holly] all right. So... Tonight we are dining on one of the most... Sought after mushrooms in the world. Remember the number one rule when you are eating wild mushrooms is to never eat anything that is not cooked. Really good. - [jake] this is really good. - Yeah [laughs]. I can only imagine it with butter and garlic. [holly] yeah. They are delicacy and they're very expensive. [jake] we make a good team. We both work hard, we both do what we need to do to help each other out. Good, huh? - Not good, huh. - [chuckles] that is incredible. [suspenseful music playing] [thunder rolls] [jake] the rain is coming down. They're coming down for a few minutes now. But, uh, we only have, like, I mean, half a dozen drops. Nothing really coming through heavy. [holly] you really brought your a-game with the structure. Fire looks good, the coal is awesome, it burns super hard. Smells like gasoline at first but it's not going down. I'm pretty contented with it. - I mean... - [holly] yeah. ...It's really helped much as raining. [holly] I feel really good. [tense music playing] [jake] I love your mushrooms. They're good and all but... Yeah. Not a lot of substance too. Yeah. Not a lot. I figured... If we can go look around in the area for something else to eat besides mushrooms. Get some protein, hopefully. We have water, we have fire. We have a great shelter. My concerns are only calories in, calories out. - [holly] you're good? - [indistinct] - yup. - Good enough. Let's see what we can find. [tense music playing] hopefully, we find something. [tense music playing] [jake] I think, I see something up here. It's an armadillo. [suspenseful music playing] [jake] you see it? Watch it coming down. Come on. Oh, my god. It's so hard. [bleep] ow. [jake] it's an armadillo. Come on, holly. Let's do this. [indistinct] [holly] it went under the rock. Come on. [suspenseful music playing] [bleep] ow. Oh, my god. It's so hard. You see it? [holly] it's going right. Got it. [jake] oh, my god. That was such work. [holly] pull back, pull back. All right. Watch out. I got him. Oh, my god. It's so hard. I got him. - Yeah. - Armadillo. [chuckles] this is... Insane. [holly] jake threw himself at this thing. I think, as a hunting team, jake and I are phenomenal together. Like, that synergy is just incredible. Oh, my god. - Yes. - Look at that. [jake] armadillo for dinner. [tense music playing] is this your first time eating armadillo? Yeah. They've been known to carry leprosy. Chicken and salmonella, can't you cook it out? Yeah. There's trichinosis in pork - and salmonella in chicken. - Okay. And that can just be cooked out, so maybe if we just cook it really thoroughly. All right. [narrator] while some armadillos can carry leprosy, cooking the meat to an internal temperature of 160 degrees will make it safe to eat. [intense music playing] [jake] all right. We've been cooking this thing for a long time and we actually ended up taking it out of the shell completely. Smells amazing. Juicy. See the fat and oil was dripping off of him. Let's go. Wow. Kind of taste like smoked ham. Incredible. Such a good gift. Such a great day. Awesome. Yeah. Down the notch. [jake] get it girl. Hmm. That's so good. [jake] yeah. [intense music playing] [jake] much as I enjoyed eating yesterday and how much energy it gave me, it's like I almost feel worse today because of it. I'm, like, hungrier than I normally am in the morning. It's like I'm going through withdrawals almost. I burned so many calories chasing after that thing and it just took a toll on me calorically. [intense music playing] [jake] I think there's some decent-sized fish in here, actually. Oh, there we go. That's a big guy right there. [suspenseful music playing] [holly] what? [bleep] yeah, baby. Oh [bleep]. [water splashes] no. That slippery devil, you. Damn it. [bleep] they're so slippery. I can't believe I caught it with my [bleep] hands. Should've [indistinct] away. [intense music playing] [jake] I think I know what a hung over 80-year-old feels like. Drained physically, not really eating. I'm missing my girlfriend and my dog... Every day. It's noticeably colder today? [jake] oh, my gosh. Absolutely. [holly] mmm-hmm. [jake] last night was just freezing. So we're gonna mud up these walls to help prevent wind from coming in. And then vertical boards in to make the door. Holy moly, you're awesome. I don't wanna take the energy and effort to build something elaborate right now. My energy levels are so sparse to begin with. Holly, you know what this is again? - [holly] what? - This is great teamwork once again. I may have said it before but it really makes the dream work. [holly] teamwork. [intense music playing] check out this fishing hole, trying to find some protein. Might have to stay a couple extra days after extraction. I gotta catch those [bleep] fish. All right. So what I did was... I took the saw brier and the hook is on the bark. So I took three hooks, put them back to back and tied them together. And I put the worm on each three hook. Hopefully they bite down hard enough or gets deep enough, lodges in there and I can catch one of these [bleep]. Oh, that did not work at all. Because they just pulled the worm right off. Man. So close. [intense music playing] [jake] so hungry. [suspenseful music playing] [jake] where did you see that? I don't even see it. Because I... [suspenseful music playing] [grunts] got one. - Did you really? - Yup. Ow, ow. - It's hot. - Let me see. [jake] wow. Look at that. Good job, holly. [bleep] yeah. I'm like, "great. I've been working on my fishing thing for days now and you just see a crawfish and catch it within 30 seconds." [intense music playing] [grunts] that's the big one. I got the one I was looking for. [chuckles] [jake] good job, holly. You're a boss. [holly] this is exactly what I needed, these challenges, helping me... To believe in myself. I think that I underestimate myself a lot but I definitely feel like I am proving myself to myself right now. [jake] I'm grabbing and you pull him out. [intense music playing] [jake] oh, this is huge. It's a cool thing to have somebody have your back. Now I realize that that's exactly the person I wanna be. Someone that supports somebody else and being out here realizing how much I love my girlfriend, how much I want her in my life and, uh, and how much this experience would've been better with her. Yeah. I think there's huge life changes for me after this. Teamwork makes the dream work. [intense music playing] [holly] feels awesome to contribute to the meal. It's not a lot of protein but it is definitely gonna boost us through the extraction. I'mma eat the tail. Because it looks small. [holly laughs] [intense music playing] [jake] the night before extraction. Extraction [indistinct] and it's a perfect night. So excited to get out of here and pack up the hell tomorrow, two weeks [indistinct] can die, just have one night's sleep and go then. [intense music playing] [mountain lion growls] [suspenseful music playing] [mountain lion growls] [mountain lion growls] [dramatic music playing] I haven't seen my hair in a while. It's crazy. [holly] the funny thing about jake's hair is that it manages to stay perfectly in place even though we have been sleeping in the mud. - [bleep] haircut, man. - [laughs] it's amazing. [holly] it's still doing the same, like, arc thing that it was when we first met. [laughs] [jake] see, I have no idea why my hair's standing the way it is. I think it gets all this natural mud and dirt and crap. I should bottle it up. Crud by j. - [laughs] - [laughs] [mountain lion growls] [jake speaking] [mountain lion growls] [suspenseful music playing] [jake speaking] [jake speaking] I think it's gone. [jake speaking] [intense music playing] [jake] sun's coming up but we made it through the night. You asleep? [holly] no. Me either. [holly] scary as hell. [jake] definitely hearing some wild animals out here. It's rise and shine [bleep]. [intense music playing] so judging by the map, we are right here. [holly] so here's that waterfall we passed, here's the fish pond. So it looks like if we just head up at a 45-degree angle, we're gonna hit these cliffs. - [jake] mmm-hmm. - [holly] and once we do, that's when we'll know to go right and go around. Love it. I love it. It's pretty straight up, man. [intense music playing] [narrator] holly and jake will have to scale four miles up a steep mountain side full of sharp slate, saw brier thorns, deadly snakes, and mountain lions that attack their prey from above. They will then have to ascend a sheer cliff face, a hundred and fifty feet high to a road where they will be rescued. [jake] goodbye, sweet, sweet little friend. [holly] dude, you did such a great job. I'll have dreams of it. - Vamanos. - So long. [intense music playing] [jake] dig in deep, girlfriend. Let's do this. [holly] dig deep. Rocky rocks. - [jake] oh, okay. - [holly] oh [bleep] so muddy. [jake] ow, man, this [bleep] sharp [bleep]. [holly] it's all right. [jake] ripping up my thighs. [holly] nice. Just how I like it. I walked into this challenge as a person who experiences a lot of self-doubt. But I'm gonna walk out of this challenge a complete badass. - [jake exhales] - holy [bleep]. - Oh, wow. - [jake] what? [holly] it sounded like something big. Hopefully it was just a tree. [tense music playing] [holly] what do you think? [jake] keep going up to the right. Seems to be the safest... I think this is the cliff that was in the map. [holly] yeah, that's looking right. [jake] that cliff separates us from the car. So let's go right around it and get home. I almost wanna jog this little bit here. [holly] please don't jog. [jake] ow, watch out, there's some sharp rocks in there. It's a heck of a climb. I believe we can do it though. Yeah. I think this is gonna be our best option. All right. Walking stick. - We're doing great. - Looking good. So I'm thinking is this is gonna be the scariest climb of my life. The rocks are loose, it's hard to find handholds, definitely dangerous but we're almost there and I know that I can do it. [jake] man, this is literally... Bear crawling this thing. This is, uh, it's pretty steep here, holly. [groans] feeling the fatigue yet? [holly] oh, yeah. [jake] yeah, me too. Before I got out here, my life fit into a box. And being out here destroyed that box and made... And freed me, honestly. I had to let go of control. I can't wait for becca to see who I've become. I'll have to grab on here so be careful. [intense music playing] [holly] oh, my god. Holy [bleep]. [jake] whoa [bleep] so exhausted. [holly laughs] [jake] yes. [bleep] I'm dizzy but that's amazing. [holly] oh, god. Made it up. Oh, we made it up to somewhere near the top. Wow, look how far. [jake] conquered that climb like a boss. [holly] we did it. [jake] let's go. - [jake] holy [bleep]. - [holly] I see it. - [jake] yes. - [holly] yes. I hear [indistinct] - [jake] yes. - Oh, my god. - It's a badass truck. - [jake] woo. [holly laughs] [bleep] did it. - [jake] we did it. - [holly] we did it. - [jake] yes. - [holly] yes. [jake] honestly, that's the most beautiful truck I've ever seen. [holly] oh, my god. - Oh, my god. We're moving. - We're moving. [laughs] [jake speaking] [holly] I feel absolutely amazing, five, ten, fifteen years down the road, this is the kind of experience that I can hold from, I just learned so much out here. I can't [bleep] we did it, man. So [bleep] cool. What a journey. [jake] yeah. After this, I don't have a comfort box anymore. I see the true benefit of being uncomfortable in coming out on the other side. [holly] I think to see that growth in you is really amazing, too. [jake] thank you very much. I really appreciate that. Holly's everything to me, man. Without her, we would've gone almost nine days without food. Because of her, the mushrooms, because of her, the crawdads, she was an ultimate team player and I owe her my hunger, my servitude, my honor, like, she just kicked ass. And your growth for the last three weeks has been incredible. You're so much more confident. Yeah, I feel like a stronger person now. I feel like I can take charge and not have to second guess myself all the time. [holly] I've overcome probably one of the most difficult 21 days anybody can do. It makes it a lot harder for me to doubt myself because I can look back and say, "no, you're not worthless. You've done all these things." [narrator] over the course of 21 days, holly lost 24 pounds. Her psr goes from 6.8 to 8.2. When I start to feel uncomfortable and pushed back, then I'm gonna be like, "nope. Look what happens when you push through that uncomfort." - yeah. - You get this moment right here. [narrator] jake lost 29 pounds. His psr goes from 7.0 to 8.1. [jake] I've had some amazing realizations since I've been here about who I wanna be, what I wanna do. What I wanna do with, so probably the very first thing I do after I get home is propose to my girlfriend who we've been together for almost two years now and I'm just extremely excited to have the love of my life be with me forever and experience all these types of joys together. Oh, my god. - This was amazing. - [holly] oh, my god. - Whee. - [jake] yeah, baby. [holly] woo, we did it. [intense music playing] [jake] you were my saving grace through that whole challenge. The only thing I thought about was you. And I realize that, like, you're my everything, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you, you know? So that's why I was thinking that maybe... Oh, my god. You wanna marry me? Oh, my god. [indistinct] a lot. - [becca] oh, my god. - [jake] I didn't officially - hear it. - [becca] yes. [jake] oh, good. I love you. [dramatic music playing] I don't wanna do any other challenges without you, baby. God, no. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
