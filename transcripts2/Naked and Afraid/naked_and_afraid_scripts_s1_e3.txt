 Jonathan: WELCOME TO THE WORST ISLAND ON THE PLANET. NO LIVING SPECIES COULD SURVIVE OUT HERE MORE THAN A WEEK. HOLY CRAP! THERE IS -- AAH! GET THAT *BLEEP* Alison: I GOT IT. I GOT IT. I GOT IT. *BLEEP* *BLEEP* DID YOU GET 'EM? Narrator: TWO STRANGERS. THERE'S MY PARTNER.

 Narrator: ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN, BOTH EXPERIENCED SURVIVALISTS, HAVE CHOSEN TO PUT THEIR SKILLS TO THE ULTIMATE TEST. THEY HAVE NO WATER, NO FOOD, AND NO CLOTHES. THEIR CHALLENGE IS TO SURVIVE FOR 21 DAYS... GOD, WE'RE SO SCREWED. Narrator: ...KNOWING THAT THE HUMAN BODY CAN ONLY LIVE THREE DAYS WITHOUT WATER... WE NEED WATER. FAST. ...AND BEGINS TO SHUT DOWN AFTER THREE WEEKS WITHOUT FOOD. THIS IS THE EVEREST OF SURVIVAL CHALLENGES. CAN A MAN AND WOMAN SURVIVE ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS NAKED AND AFRAID? Alison: THIS ISLAND MIGHT LOOK LIKE A POSTCARD,

 BUT THIS IS THE ISLAND FROM HELL. Jonathan: BASED OFF MY MILITARY TRAINING AND SURVIVAL SKILLS, THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS I'LL EVER DO. Alison: MAN, THIS IS INTENSE. WHEW! I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. Narrator: THE MALDIVE ISLANDS -- JUST 40 MILES FROM THE EQUATOR IN THE INDIAN OCEAN. THE TROPICAL CLIMATE CAN PRODUCE TEMPERATURES UP TO A STAGGERING 120 DEGREES WITH HIGH HUMIDITY. DESTRUCTIVE STORMS CAN BATTER THE ISLANDS FOR WEEKS WITH HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS AND MONSOON RAINS. THE ISLAND IS RINGED BY JAGGED, CORAL REEFS -- BEAUTIFUL TO THE EYE, BUT HAZARDOUS TO THE TOUCH. AND THE WATERS AROUND THE REEF ARE PATROLLED BY DANGEROUS CREATURES, SUCH AS REEF SHARKS, EELS, AND STINGRAYS. JUST LIKE PRIOR TO A MISSION, I'LL GET A LITTLE ANXIOUS AND ANXIETY AND NERVOUS 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. I FEEL LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW. I'M JONATHAN KLAY. I'M A FORMER RECON MARINE AND A SNIPER. PHYSICALLY, I DESCRIBE MYSELF AS A WORKOUT MANIAC. I'VE DONE EIGHT TRIATHLONS. I'VE DONE FOUR MARATHONS WITHOUT TRAINING. I'VE TRAVELED THE WORLD DOING TOP-SECRET MISSIONS, SNIPER MISSIONS, HOSTAGE RECOVERY MISSIONS, DIVE MISSIONS. IN EVERY COUNTRY I WENT TO, I HAD TO LIVE IN THE JUNGLE, SURVIVE IN THE BUSH. NO MATTER HOW HARD THIS CHALLENGE IS, I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT. Alison: WHOO! OH, MY GOSH. AM I REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO MEET THIS NAKED PERSON? MY NAME IS ALISON TEAL. I'M A SURFER, A SURVIVALIST, AND AN ADVENTURE MODEL. I WAS THAT SORT OF TARZAN CHILD RAISED AROUND THE WORLD. AND WE WENT TO THE MOST REMOTE AND EXOTIC CORNERS ON THE EARTH AND LIVED THERE. NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL GROWING UP AND BASICALLY LIVED IN A 6x6-FOOT TENT IN EVERY COUNTRY YOU COULD IMAGINE. I THINK I'M A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD. PEOPLE CALL ME THE WALKING GLOBAL ENCYCLOPEDIA. I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S KIND OF A COMING OF AGE ADVENTURE FOR ME. I'M GOING TO BE MEETING SOME MYSTERY MAN AND THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY INTERESTING. Jonathan: I'M ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT THE HEAT. IT'S REALLY EARLY RIGHT NOW IN THE MORNING AND IT'S ALREADY 100% HUMIDITY. DEFINITELY, THE HEAT IS GONNA BE A MAIN FACTOR. I DON'T WANT TO BURN MYSELF AND GET BLISTERS ON MY SKIN ON THE FIRST DAY. IT'S BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE, BUT I'M SURE IT'S GOING TO BE TREACHEROUS. Alison: WHEW! I'M NERVOUS. I FEEL A LITTLE BIT LOOPY. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD OR A BAD THING, BUT -- AAH! I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS MEETING MY PARTNER, NAKED IN THE WILD. MY NICKNAME GROWING UP WAS "THE NUN." SO I AM RATHER CONSERVATIVE IN MY VALUES, ALTHOUGH I MAY SEEM LIKE THIS VERY VIVACIOUS SURFER GIRL. I DON'T TAKE IT OFF MUCH. OH-HO, IT'S GETTING HOT. Jonathan: BEING NAKED ON THIS CHALLENGE IS NOT A PROBLEM. I'M COMFORTABLE IN MY OWN SKIN. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS I BURN EASY, AND I DON'T WANT MY PERSONAL PRIVATE PARTS TO GET FRIED AND BURNED. Alison: THE GOOD NEWS IS, IS THAT WE'RE BOTH NAKED IN THIS TOGETHER, SO I'M HOPING THAT HE'S THINKING THE SAME THING AS ME, AS "OH, MY GOSH. AM I REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO MEET THIS NAKED PERSON?" HOLY MOLY. I WOULD SAY ANY PERSON NOWADAYS BEING THROWN IN A SITUATION WITH ANOTHER PERSON WHO'S NAKED AND YOU'VE NEVER MET HIM BEFORE -- YOU'RE GONNA FEEL SLIGHTLY STRANGE NO MATTER WHAT. Jonathan: HOPEFULLY, MY PARTNER IS COMFORTABLE BEING NAKED AND SHE DON'T MIND ME STARING AT HER. Alison: AND THEN -- DAMN. THERE IS THIS NAKED MAN. HE'S COMING AT ME, AND I'M LIKE, "WOW. THAT'S A NAKED MAN." HELLO. ALOHA. JONATHAN. ALISON. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. Jonathan: WHEN I SAW ALISON, I SAW, "OH GOOD. YOUNG, ATTRACTIVE GIRL, ALSO, LOOKS LIKE SHE'S IN SHAPE. IT'S BEAUTIFUL OUT, HUH? I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE. IT'S VERY HOT. Alison: THE FIRST THOUGHTS THAT RAN THROUGH MY MIND WERE, "OH, GOD. THIS GUY'S NAKED AND SO AM I, AND I DON'T KNOW HIM." THIS ISN'T WEIRD AT ALL. BIG DUDE, YOU KNOW, BUT SUPER FIT AND I'M LIKE, "OH MY GOSH, THIS IS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A MOVIE." WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET OUT OF THE SUN... YEAH. I'M ROASTING. ...AND GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO? ALL RIGHT. Narrator: ALISON AND JONATHAN ARE EACH ALLOWED TO BRING ONE ESSENTIAL SURVIVAL ITEM. I GOT A HATCHET. WHAT DO YOU GOT? LOOKS LIKE A FLINT STARTER. WHOO! YEP, THAT'S FIRE. A SMALL CREW WILL CAPTURE THE 21-DAY JOURNEY WITH CLEAR INSTRUCTION NOT TO INTERVENE UNLESS THERE IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY. GOT A DIARY CAM. OH WOW. OKAY. IN ADDITION, JONATHAN AND ALISON ARE GIVEN HANDHELD CAMERAS TO DOCUMENT THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE. STATE YOUR NAME, AGE, AND WHERE YOU'RE FROM. NO STATE YOUR NAME, AGE, AND WHERE YOU FROM. JONATHAN KLAY, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA. ALISON TEAL, THE WORLD. HAWAII. OH-HO! TREASURE MAP. JONATHAN AND ALISON HAVE BEEN GIVEN A MAP THAT SHOWS TWO DIFFERENT ISLANDS -- THE SMALLER ONE THAT THEY ARE ON AND A SIGNIFICANTLY BIGGER ONE OVER A MILE AWAY SEPARATED BY A SHARK-INFESTED CHANNEL WITH STRONG TIDES. THE LARGER ISLAND, HOWEVER, PROMISES MORE RESOURCES AND THEREFORE INCREASES THEIR CHANCES FOR SURVIVAL. IF JONATHAN AND ALISON CAN SURVIVE THE 21-DAY ORDEAL, THEY CAN SWIM TO THEIR EXTRACTION POINT ON THE MAP, WHICH WILL BE THEIR WAY OUT. SO WHERE ARE WE? THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. THIS ISLAND DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS. YEAH, THIS LOOKS PRETTY DAMN BIG. Alison: ON THE MAP, THERE WAS TWO ISLANDS AND IN BETWEEN THE ISLANDS WERE SHARKS. AND WE'RE ON THE ITTY-BITTY ONE WITH NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES, AND THERE'S A HUGE, BEAUTIFUL ONE RIGHT ACROSS THE WAY. I THOUGHT, "OH, BOY. WE'RE IN FOR A BIG SWIM. THIS IS FREAKING NUTS." Alison: OKAY, SO MY ONLY CONCERN IS SPECIES OF SHARKS OR STINGRAYS OR ANYTHING. Jonathan: MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT THE SUN REFLECTING OFF THE WATER IS HITTING MY SKIN. I ALREADY BURN EASY. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE DAY 1 ON THIS LITTLE ISLAND THAT HAS NOTHING TO OFFER US. IF WE STAY HERE, WE'RE JUST GONNA DIE OF STARVATION AND LACK OF WATER. I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY WE RISK THIS SWIM WITH THE SHARKS, BECAUSE ON THE BIGGER ISLAND, THERE SHOULD BE MORE OPPORTUNITY AND RESOURCES TO SURVIVE. Alison: I LOVE THE OCEAN AND I LOVE SWIMMING, BUT SHARKS ARE DEFINITELY A FEAR IN THAT CHANNEL. I'M NOT USUALLY AFRAID OF SHARKS AS A SURFER. BUT RECENTLY, A 19-FOOT TIGER SHARK SWAM UNDER ME, AND SINCE THEN, I DON'T MESS WITH THE SHARKS. Jonathan: THE FEAR OF BEING PULLED INTO THE DEEP, BLUE YONDER IS TERRIFYING. THOSE TIDES ARE STRONG. THE THOUGHT OF BEING EATEN BY A SHARK IS MY WORST NIGHTMARE. IT MADE ME SWIM FASTER THAN I EVER THOUGHT I COULD. GOOD JOB. NICE! WE DID IT. WHOO! ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS TOUGH. MAN. DID A GOOD JOB, THOUGH. Alison: WHEN I GOT TO THE SHORE AFTER THE SWIM, I WAS LIKE, * AH * WE DID IT! I THINK IT WAS KIND OF OUR FIRST BONDING EXPERIENCE. Jonathan: THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT SHE'S A TEAM PLAYER AND ALSO CAN HANG THROUGH THIS WHOLE CHALLENGE. Narrator: AS PART OF THEIR SELECTION PROCESS, JONATHAN AND ALISON HAVE UNDERGONE RIGOROUS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING. THEIR OVERALL SURVIVAL ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN EVALUATED BY EXPERTS ACCORDING TO THREE CATEGORIES -- SKILL, EXPERIENCE, AND MENTAL. JONATHAN'S MILITARY BACKGROUND SCORES HIM HIGHLY, BUT HIS DIFFICULTIES WITH SOCIAL SKILLS COUNT AGAINST HIM. ALISON HAS A GREAT RANGE OF SURVIVAL SKILLS AFTER BEING IMMERSED IN DIFFERENT CULTURES AROUND THE WORLD. BUT HER LACK OF EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH HARDCORE MILITARY TYPES RAISES A QUESTION OF HOW SHE'LL BE ABLE TO FUNCTION WITH JONATHAN. JONATHAN AND ALISON ARE GIVEN AN OVERALL PRIMITIVE SURVIVAL RATING, OR PSR. JONATHAN'S IS SET AT 6.9, AND ALISON'S COMES IN AT 8.0. OUR EXPERTS WILL REASSESS THEIR PRIMITIVE SURVIVAL RATING AT THE END OF THE 21-DAY CHALLENGE. LET'S GET IN THE SHADE. I'M BURNING UP. YEAH, I'M ROASTING. Narrator: THE DAY JONATHAN AND ALISON ARRIVED IN THE MALDIVES COINCIDED WITH THE START OF AN UNPRECEDENTED HEAT WAVE, WHERE THEY ARE SEARED BY RECORD TEMPERATURES. BURN TIME ON THEIR EXPOSED SKIN IS APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES. THE PAIN FROM SEVERE SUNBURN IS DEVASTATING. THE SKIN WILL BOIL, AND THERE'S A HIGH RISK OF SEVERE SHOCK AND EVEN DEATH. Alison: WOW. THAT SUN IS INTENSE, DUDE. YEAH, THAT'S WHY WE GOT TO GET IN THE SHADE OVER HERE. Jonathan: IT'S SO HOT, IT'S MAKING IT UNBEARABLE TO DEAL WITH. THIS IS BEYOND WHAT I THOUGHT. IT'S JUST TOO HOT. YOUR BACK IS FRIED. WOW. THAT'S CRAZY. Alison: YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT SKIN TYPES. I FEEL LIKE WITH JONATHAN, IT'S KIND OF PROBABLY A PROCESS HE'S GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH. LET'S WALK FAST, THOUGH, 'CAUSE I'M BURNING ALREADY. Jonathan: WHEN I STARTED BURNING RIGHT AWAY, I KNEW THAT WE CAN'T BE WASTING MORE TIME. THE SUN'S KILLING ME. I HAVE TO GET OUT OF THE SUN. Alison: SUNBURN IS ALWAYS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS IN THE TROPICS. BUT YOU KNOW, WE'RE SURVIVING. WE'RE NOT HERE ON ISLAND TANNING BEDS. HE'S TOUGH. HE'LL MAKE IT THROUGH. LET'S -- LET'S GET TO THE SHADE AND THEN LOOK FOR -- I NEED TO GET OUT OF THE SUN, PLEASE. I'M REALLY BURNING UP HERE. Alison: WELL DO YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF IT RIGHT THIS MINUTE? NO, LET'S GO AROUND THIS, ON THE SHADY SIDE OF THE ISLAND RIGHT HERE. HOLY CRAP, IT'S HOT. Alison: AT LEAST I HAVE MY BOOBS COVERED. Jonathan: WATER AND SHELTER ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS, TO GET OUT OF THE SUN. BUILDING ONE BIG SHELTER, WE CAN BOTH FIT ON ONE BED THAT'S ELEVATED OFF THE GROUND SO WE CAN USE EACH OTHER AS BODY HEAT TO KEEP EACH OTHER WARM. IF NOT, WE'RE BOTH GONNA HAVE HYPOTHERMIA OR FREEZE. YOU ARE SO BURNED. Alison: I WOULD SAY MY MAIN CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS THAT JONATHAN IS EXTREMELY SUNBURNED AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OUT HERE THAT ACTS AS NATURAL SUNSCREEN. I AM *BLEEP* BEAT. YEAH. HAVE YOU BEEN REALLY SUNBURNED? YEAH, ONCE. IT BLISTERED. DID IT? PARTS OF ME THAT NEVER BEEN -- SEEN SUN BEFORE, THAT'S WHAT HURTS. Jonathan: THE BURN DOESN'T MESS UP MY MORALE. I MEAN, IT DOES PUT A DAMPER ON THINGS. IT'S NOT SLOWING ME DOWN. IT'S NOT HAMPERING MY ACHIEVEABILTY TO GATHER FOOD OR LOOK FOR SHELTER OR ANYTHING. I'M JUST PROBABLY GOING TO FEEL IT TONIGHT WHEN I LAY DOWN. I NEED TO REST FOR LIKE 30 MINUTES. YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW. YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD. Alison: I'M JUST MAKING THINGS 'CAUSE I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED THEM. I'M LIKE MacGyver. I CAN WEAVE A HAT OR MAKE A BLANKET JUST USING THE ELEMENTS OF THE ISLAND. THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT I'VE DONE EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL. I'M BURNT AND MISERABLE. I CAN'T MOVE. I CAN'T TOUCH ANYTHING. IT HURTS ALL UP AND DOWN MY BODY. Narrator: JONATHAN'S BURNS ARE GROWING MORE SEVERE WITH EACH PASSING MINUTE. REDNESS OF THE SKIN, IF UNTREATED, WILL LEAD TO SWELLING, BLISTERING, AND SEVERE PAIN. Jonathan: THE BURN I HAVE RIGHT NOW IS CURRENTLY ALL OVER MY BODY. I'M LIKE REALLY FREAKING HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. THE FEW DAYS I'LL SPEND HERE CAN AFFECT THE REST OF MY LIFE. IF IT WAS COOLER, I'D PROBABLY BE ABLE TO MOVE AROUND AND BE MOBILE AND... AND NOT HATE LIFE. I'M HATING LIFE, WONDERING WHY I'M PUTTING MYSELF THROUGH THIS. THIS IS -- I DON'T KNOW HOW THE *BLEEP* WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT, LIKE, IN THIS *BLEEP* HEAT EVERY DAY FOR 20 MORE DAYS. I'M BURNING MYSELF TO DEATH. MY SKIN CAN'T TAKE THIS *BLEEP* OH, MY GOD. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE NO MORE. I JUST WANT TO GO HOME. I CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER DAY IN THIS HEAT. Alison: I'M NOT DRINKING THAT. I THINK IT'S FINE. IT TASTES FINE TO ME. THIS SUCKS. I HATE IT HERE. THIS IS LITERALLY THE ISLAND FROM HELL. OH, MY GOODNESS. PARTS OF ME THAT NEVER BEEN -- SEEN SUN BEFORE, THAT'S WHAT HURTS. Narrator: JONATHAN AND ALISON HAVE SPENT THE LAST 30 HOURS NAKED AND ISOLATED ON A REMOTE MALDIVIAN ISLAND. TEMPERATURES ARE OPPRESSIVE AS THE MALDIVES EXPERIENCED AN UNPRECEDENTED HEAT WAVE. BUT JONATHAN'S MILITARY BACKGROUND COULD NOT PREPARE HIM FOR THE DEVASTATING EFFECT OF THE SUN'S ULTRAVIOLET RAYS ON HIS EXPOSED BODY... I'M BURNT AND MISERABLE. ...LEAVING ALISON TO PICK UP THE SLACK, USING HER EXPERIENCE TO CRAFT ESSENTIAL SURVIVAL ITEMS. YOU COULD FLIP IT AND CARRY THINGS IN IT. THE TEAM IS IN TROUBLE ALREADY WITH ONE MAN DOWN AND THE POSSIBILITY OF ALISON FACING THE REMAINING 20 DAYS ALONE. OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T DO IT NO MORE. I MIGHT HAVE TO CALL IT QUITS. I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT. I'M ALREADY BREAKING DOWN. IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT I CAN'T HANDLE THIS SURVIVAL CHALLENGE. BEING A RECON MARINE OR SURVIVAL EXPERT DOESN'T MATTER. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR EXPERTISES ARE, THE SUN WILL BEAT YOU DOWN. I-I DON'T WANT TO DO IT NO MORE. Narrator: IF JONATHAN QUITS, HE WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE ISLAND AND FLOWN HOME IMMEDIATELY, LEAVING HIS PARTNER ALISON ALONE TO CONTINUE THE REMAINING 18 DAYS WITHOUT HIM. I'M EXHAUSTED. I DON'T KNOW IF JONATHAN'S GONNA LEAVE OR NOT. THAT WOULD LEAVE ME HERE ALONE. I JUST HAVE TO BE REALLY STRONG. LAST NIGHT WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST MISERABLE NIGHTS I'VE HAD. NO SLEEP, MY SUNBURN'S HURTING ME EVERY TIME I LAY DOWN OR TURN OVER. Alison: THE SUNBURN THAT JONATHAN HAS IS 90 MILLION TIMES WORSE THAN THE WORST SUNBURN I'VE EVER HAD, AND I'VE BEEN REALLY SUNBURNED. OKAY, LET ME TRY THIS. GROWING UP IN HAWAII, I LEARNED LOTS OF USEFUL SKILLS THAT PEOPLE WHO GREW UP IN OTHER KINDS OF PLACES PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT. SO YOU ONLY WANT THE WHITE BERRIES. THE WHITE BERRIES HELP WITH SUNBURN. JUST MASH 'EM. I'M MASHING THE SEEDS UP TO MAKE THE JUICE TO RUB ON MY BURN. THESE ARE CALLED NAUPAKA WHERE I'M FROM. GEEZ. LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE ALMOST BURNT BY A FIRE. Narrator: AS THE DAY PASSES, JONATHAN'S CONDITION DOES NOT IMPROVE. HOW YOU DOING? I'M IN REALLY EXCRUCIATING PAIN. OH, MY GOD. IT'S GETTING WORSE. Jonathan: THIS BURN IS MESSING WITH MY MIND 'CAUSE IT'S JUST MAKING ME WANT TO JUST GIVE UP AND THROW IN THE TOWEL AND JUST GO HOME. OH, MY GOD. OKAY. Alison: I'M DEFINITELY STARTING TO GET SCARED NOW BECAUSE IT'S ONLY DAY 3, AND HE'S COMPLETELY DOWN, CAN'T DO ANYTHING. I'M TRYING TO KIND OF PROCESS ALL THIS. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I'M GONNA GO GET SOME COCONUTS. Jonathan: ALL RIGHT. IT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE ON ME. THINGS ARE GOING TO GET REALLY HECTIC AROUND HERE IF HE IS NOT ABLE TO SNAP INTO GEAR. I CAN'T TAKE THIS. WHOO! I GOT MYSELF A PURSE, RIGHT? THAT'LL BE PERFECT. Narrator: IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR COASTAL CURRENTS TO WASH ALL KINDS OF DEBRIS ASHORE. THIS IS THE FIND OF THE DAY. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MY SIZE. BEACH TRASH IS KEY. YOU KNOW, ONE MAN'S TRASH, ANOTHER MAN'S TREASURE. I ACTUALLY FOUND HIM A PAIR OF UNDERWEAR. WE NEED HYDRATION. COCONUTS ARE ONE OF THE BEST HYDRATION IN THE WORLD. I THINK SHOULD GO FOR THE ONES I KNOW ARE CLOSE TO THE GROUND FIRST. Narrator: LACK OF FRESH WATER ON THE MALDIVE ISLANDS CAN MAKE SURVIVAL EXTREMELY PERILOUS. AND WHILE COCONUTS CAN PROVIDE A SOURCE OF WATER, OVERCONSUMPTION OF RIPE COCONUTS CAN HAVE A DIURETIC EFFECT ON THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND THIS CAN LEAD TO DEHYDRATION. THE BAMBOO STICKS JUST ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH. I'M JUST GONNA CLIMB MYSELF UP THERE. Jonathan: I'M IRRITATED THAT ALISON IS FIXATED ON THESE LITTLE, GIRLY BASKETS AND THINGS INSTEAD OF GOING OUT AND LOOKING FOR FRESH WATER, WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY NEED. INSTEAD, SHE'S OBSESSED WITH COCONUTS. PERSONALLY, I CAN CARE LESS ABOUT THE FRICKING COCONUTS. I THINK FRESH WATER'S MORE IMPORTANT. OH, WATER. OH, THERE'S FIRE ANTS EVERYWHERE. UGH. FIRE ANTS. WHAT'S UP, YO? WHAT'S UP? YOU WERE GONE FOR A LONG TIME. I KNOW. WHAT THE HELL YOU GOT ON YOU? WHAT? ALL THAT FOR THREE COCONUTS? NO, NOT THREE COCONUTS. I BROUGHT ABOUT 24 TO 30 COCONUTS, BUT I COULDN'T CARRY THEM ALL. WHERE ARE THEY AT? I JUST WANTED TO GET YOU A COUPLE BACK SO YOU COULD DRINK THEM. I'M LITERALLY DOING 24/7 TASKS ALL DAY LONG -- WEAVING BASKETS, WEAVING HATS, AND GATHERING COCONUTS AND REBUILDING OUR SHELTER. AND I'LL GET BACK TO CAMP AND JONATHAN JUST KIND OF POO-POOS WHAT I'M DOING. I'M LIKE, "WELL, AT LEAST I'M NOT SLEEPING IN THE SHACK ALL DAY." YOU KNOW, FOUR GOOD CHUGS OUT OF EACH OF THEM. IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING. YEAH, BUT IT'S ONLY TWO SIPS OF EACH *BLEEP* COCONUT. OH, MY GOD. Alison: EVERY DAY, WHEN JONATHAN JUST LIES THERE, I FEEL A COMBINATION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIM AND FRUSTRATION THAT I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN PULL OFF SURVIVAL FOR THE BOTH OF US. BECAUSE OF JONATHAN'S INJURY, WE'VE BASICALLY BEEN BARELY SURVIVING. HE'S WORTHLESS. EVERYTHING'S KIND OF ON MY SHOULDERS RIGHT NOW. SO WHEN HE GETS BETTER, I HOPE HE CAN FISH, MAKE A SPEAR, OR AT LEAST TAKE MY DIRECTION. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IS A BIG, STRONG MILITARY MAN BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO BY A LITTLE, HAWAIIAN HULA DANCER. HMM. BEING A GIRL, I HAVE WOKEN UP THIS MORNING WITH THE WORST CRAMPS EVER. AND I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP MY SPIRITS UP. I FEEL LIKE IF MY SPIRITS GET DOWN, THEN I'M GOING TO LET MY CRAMPS TAKE OVER AND THEN, YOU KNOW, I MIGHT NOT EVEN MAKE IT. Narrator: WITH ALISON HIT BADLY BY MENSTRUAL CRAMPS, SHE'S UNABLE TO GATHER COCONUTS. THE RESPONSIBILITY NOW FALLS ON JONATHAN TO FINALLY STEP UP. Jonathan: ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T SLEEP THAT WELL LAST NIGHT AND I'M STILL FEELING A LOT OF PAIN THROUGH MY SUNBURN, I REALIZE THAT I CAN MOVE AROUND AND GET THINGS ACCOMPLISHED, BUT AS LONG AS NOTHING TOUCHES ME. I WOUND UP DIGGING FOR WATER 'CAUSE COCONUTS ARE NOT GONNA DO IT. Narrator: WELL WATER CAN BE EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS ON THE MALDIVE ISLANDS. THE COUNTRY'S FRESHWATER TABLE EXTENDS BELOW THE SEA LEVEL AND IS VULNERABLE TO CONTAMINATION FROM THE SEAWATER. SALTWATER POISONING CAN PRODUCE FATAL SEIZURE AND HEART ARRHYTHMIA. Jonathan: WE GOT TO FIND AN AREA WHERE IT'S GREEN AND PLUSH, THAT'S WHERE THE WATER IS UNDER THE GROUND. I ALMOST GAVE UP AND QUIT. DEHYDRATION AND THE SUNBURN WERE MESSING WITH MY MIND. BUT TODAY, I FEEL GOOD, MENTALLY. TIME TO START DIGGING. JONATHAN'S GOING TO TRY TO DIG A WELL BECAUSE WE NEED WATER. SINCE JONATHAN GOT SUNBURN ON THE FIRST DAY, HE'S REALLY BEEN OUT OF THE CHALLENGE HERE. SO IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD FOR ME TO TELL WHAT SKILLS HE HAS OR DOESN'T HAVE. WE JUST NEED WATER -- BIG TIME. IT'S BEEN DAYS SINCE WE'VE HAD FRESH WATER, AND OUR STOMACHS ARE FEELING IT. PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO DIG FOR OUR WATER, AND THAT'S A HUGE EXERTION OF ENERGY. Jonathan: THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN DIGGING A WATER HOLE. I CAN GO ANOTHER THREE, FOUR DAYS WITHOUT FOOD. THAT'S OKAY. BUT I NEED REAL WATER. I CAN'T TAKE COCONUTS ANYMORE. COME ON, WATER. WHERE ARE YOU? I'M GETTING TOO DEEP. Alison: I'VE NEVER HAD ILLNESSES THAT TAKE ME DOWN, BUT WHEN I GET CRAMPS FROM MY PERIOD, THE LAST TIME I GOT IT, I PASSED OUT AND ENDED UP IN THE ER. IT'S STARTING TO GET HOT, EVEN IN THE SHADE. MY SUNBURN IS NOT GETTING ANY BETTER. MY LEGS AND MY CROTCH AREA ARE STILL IN PAIN. IF I DON'T TOUCH WATER TODAY AND WE DON'T HAVE CLEAN WATER TO DRINK IN THE MORNING, WE'RE SCREWED. Alison: TO DEAL WITH THIS IN THE WILDERNESS WITH NOTHING IS REALLY INTENSE FOR ME RIGHT NOW. MY BODY, AS A FEMALE, RIGHT NOW JUST...NEEDS SOME TIME. Jonathan: AS LONG AS I GET THIS FINISHED BEFORE SUNDOWN, THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT. I'M LOSING DEPTH IN MY ARM TO REACH DOWN THERE. MAN, I'M OUT OF SHAPE. RUNNING OUT OF ENERGY. NO WATER. NO WATER YET. I HAD TO WORK MY ASS OFF. HOW MUCH DEEPER DID YOU GO? I COULDN'T FIT MY BODY IN THERE. RIGHT. WE NEED WATER. WE HAVE NOTHING. I'M NOT DISAGREEING WITH YOU. I'M JUST SAYING WE'RE GONNA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MORNING RIGHT WHEN THE SUN COMES UP, OKAY? YOU DO WHAT'S IMPORTANT, I'LL DO WHAT'S IMPORTANT, AND WE'LL SURVIVE. Alison: IT'S DAY 7, AND MY CRAMPS ARE STILL HURTING LIKE HELL. JONATHAN'S TRYING TO GET THE WATER GOING. HOPE WE GET WATER SOON. Jonathan: I'M IN A BAD MOOD. IT'S FRUSTRATING 'CAUSE I'M WORKING REALLY, REALLY HARD TO DIG AND DIG AND DIG WITH ABSOLUTELY NO ENERGY. I'M DRIPPING MORE SWEAT THAN I'VE BEEN DRINKING AND I GOT TO KEEP DIGGING THE HOLE WIDER AND DEEPER. I'M GETTING PISSED. NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN WATER RIGHT NOW. I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT FINDING WATER. THAT'S JUST MY SOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE RIGHT NOW. WITHOUT WATER, WE'RE NOT GONNA SURVIVE. Narrator: ALISON AND JONATHAN HAVE BEEN SURVIVING TOGETHER ON THE MALDIVE ISLANDS FOR MORE THAN A WEEK. BEFORE THEY EMBARKED ON THIS CHALLENGE, THEY WERE ASSESSED BY A SURVIVAL EXPERT AND EACH GIVEN A PRIMITIVE SURVIVAL RATING, OR PSR. THEIR PSR CHANGES ACCORDING TO HOW THEY'RE COPING WITH THE CONDITIONS. THEY'LL BE REASSESSED AT THE END OF THE 21 DAYS. AN INCREDIBLY PAINFUL SUNBURN IMMOBILIZED JONATHAN FOR THREE DAYS... I CAN'T TAKE THIS. ...LEAVING ALISON TOTALLY IN CHARGE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THEIR FOOD, WATER, AND OVERALL WELFARE. Alison: EVERY DAY WHEN JONATHAN JUST LIES THERE, I FEEL A COMBINATION OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIM AND FRUSTRATION. IT'S ONLY TWO SIPS OF EACH *BLEEP* COCONUT. OH, MY GOD. Narrator: THE TABLES HAVE TURNED AS ALISON HAS COME DOWN WITH DEBILITATING MENSTRUAL CRAMPS. Alison: WHEN I GET CRAMPS, THE LAST TIME I GOT IT, I PASSED OUT AND ENDED UP IN THE ER. Narrator: JONATHAN, DESPERATE TO PROVE HIS WORTH, HAS BEEN DIGGING A WELL FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS, CONSUMED WITH BREAKING THROUGH THE BEDROCK TO THE WATER TABLE SO THAT THEY CAN GET FRESH WATER. NO WATER YET? NO. I STILL THINK I NEED TO GO ANOTHER FOOT TO TWO FEET DEEPER. Jonathan: I AM SO EXHAUSTED. I'M GETTING PISSED BECAUSE I WANT TO FIND WATER. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND, TODAY, I GOT TO COMMIT, EVEN IF IT'S BOTH SHIFTS -- THE MORNING SHIFT AND EVENING SHIFT -- TO KEEP DIGGING FOR WATER. Narrator: JONATHAN IS LOSING MORE FLUIDS THAN HE IS DRINKING. HE IS TAKING A DESPERATE GAMBLE THAT DEHYDRATION WILL NOT IMMOBILIZE HIM BEFORE HE BREAKS THROUGH TO THE WATER TABLE. Jonathan: I BUSTED THROUGH THE INCH OR TWO INCHES OF SHEET ROCK. IT'S GIVING ME A HARD TIME. WHOO-HOO! WATER! FINALLY, NO MORE FREAKING COCONUTS! Alison: WOW! HOLY MOLY! YOU ARE A MAN IN A HOLE. WOW! WATER! I'M NOT DRINKING THAT. I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING THAT WE HAVE WATER. Jonathan: I'M GONNA DRINK IT, DUDE. I DON'T CARE. ARE YOU SERIOUS? I DON'T KNOW, MY NUMBER-ONE SAFETY IN THE WORLD IS NOT DRINKING WATER THAT I'M NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE ABOUT. Alison: I'VE TRAVELED THE WORLD SINCE BIRTH, AND THE NUMBER-ONE THING YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO IS DRINK BAD WATER. IT'S LIKE MILK. IT JUST HAS OXYGEN IN IT, MAYBE, OR SAND. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO BUGS IN IT. I BELIEVE THAT UNLESS YOU CAN BOIL OR PUT IODINE OR FILTER YOUR WATER, YOU SHOULD NEVER TRUST IT. I THINK IT'S FINE. IT TASTES FINE TO ME. ANOTHER REASON I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A DOCTOR. I'M JUST REALLY CAREFUL. I THINK WHEN YOU GET INTO A SURVIVAL SITUATION, YOU GET SO THIRSTY THAT YOU JUST WILL DRINK ANYTHING YOU CAN FIND, AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA. IF YOU DRINK BAD WATER, YOU CAN DIE. I'M DOWN TO DRINK THE WHOLE THING. QUIT BEING A WUSS. Jonathan: I THINK ALISON IS BEING OVERLY CAUTIOUS. PLUS, SHE'S COCONUT CRAZY. ALL SHE WANTS IS COCONUTS. SO IT'S HER CHOICE. IF SHE WANTS TO CONTINUE BEING A BABY AND BEING ALL BOURGIE, SCREW HER. Alison: I FEEL LIKE UP TILL NOW, AND IT COULD BE DUE TO HIS SUN POISONING, THAT I DON'T FEEL THAT I CAN TRUST JONATHAN'S OPINION ON SURVIVAL STANDARDS OR TACTICS THAT WE SHOULD USE. Jonathan: IT BOTHERS ME THAT WE'RE NOT WORKING AS A TEAM. I HAVE TO CONVINCE HER WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND WHAT'S NOT, AND I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT NO MORE. IT'S RIDICULOUS. IF SHE STILL WANTS TO BE STUBBORN AND BE A LITTLE KID ABOUT IT, FINE. I WILL JUST DO MY OWN THING TILL THE CHALLENGE IS OVER. I GOT SOME UNDIES. DAMN, THEY'RE TIGHT. BUT IT'S COOL THAT ALISON WAS ABLE TO FIND THEM FOR ME. HEY, JONATHAN! Jonathan: YEAH, WHAT'S UP? OW! I JUST WALKED OUTSIDE OF OUR HUT AND I STEPPED RIGHT IN POOP. AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT THE HECK IS THIS? AND THERE'S JUST COMPLETE BUZZING FLIES ALL OVER IT AND I WAS LIKE, "WOW, THERE'S A DOG ON THE -- THERE'S NO DOG ON THIS ISLAND." AND THEN I WAS LIKE, "OH." Jonathan: I HAVE NOW DIARRHEA. I'M FEELING VERY WEAK, SO I'M RUNNING -- RUNNING DOWN LOW. THIS WATER THAT'S BEEN SITTING IN THE WELL HAS PROBABLY BEEN SITTING THERE FOR YEARS. AND SO IT'S VERY DIRTY, CONTAMINATED WATER AND NOW I'M PAYING THE PRICE FOR IT. MADE ME HAVE NO CONTROL OF MY BLADDER, MY DEFECATION OR WHATEVER. I DON'T WANT TO TRY AND LIKE EMBARRASS YOU, BUT I DON'T -- EMBARRASS ME? YOU'RE NOT GONNA EMBARRASS ME. I WANT YOU TO SPEAK YOUR MIND. OKAY, WELL I JUST -- I WOULD NEVER, EVER GO TO THE BATHROOM NEAR A SHELTER, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING -- THAT'S -- IF YOU HAVE DIARRHEA, WHAT CAN YOU DO? YOU JUST GOT TO DROP TROU RIGHT THERE. BUT THEN DO YOU JUST LEAVE IT? NO, I BURIED IT WITH COCONUTS AND ALL THAT STUFF. I STEPPED IN IT. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GO BACK THAT FAR. IT WAS RIGHT BEHIND OUR SHELTER. NO, IT'S 30 FEET. ANYWAY, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. I-I'LL MAN UP AND APOLOGIZE, OKAY? I APPRECIATE IT. THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. Alison: THERE IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RULE IN SURVIVAL, THAT YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM A CERTAIN DISTANCE AWAY FROM YOUR FORT AND A CERTAIN DEPTH IN THE GROUND. YOU DON'T GO POOP TEN FEET FROM YOUR SHELTER AND LEAVE IT UNCOVERED. Jonathan: SHE WAS RIGHT. ILL GIVE HER CREDIT ON THAT. SHE WAS RIGHT, MAYBE IT IS MY FAULT, BUT BYGONES BE BYGONES, LET'S MOVE ON. Alison: THAT WATER HE DRANK GAVE HIM DIARRHEA. IF JONATHAN CAN MAKE THAT KIND OF A RASH DECISION, IT REALLY MAKES ME QUESTION OUR ROLES HERE AND HOW MUCH I CAN TRUST HIM. MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW, EXPLORE SOME OTHER OPTIONS OF WAYS TO GET SOME FOOD. YOU TELL ME HOW, I'LL DO IT. DO YOU WANT ME TO? I MEAN, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO STAY AWAY FROM BEING, LIKE, RINGLEADER JUST 'CAUSE -- WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE WITH ALL THE ANSWERS, LET'S SEE. AM I? THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE. WELL MAYBE THERE'S A TALK WE NEED TO HAVE BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER, 'CAUSE I'M KIND OF FEELING LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW. I'M TRYING TO TREAD LIGHTLY 'CAUSE I'M TRYING TO RESPECT YOU AS A MAN AND YOUR DECISIONS THAT YOU, YOU KNOW NEED TO MAKE AND TO HELP, BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE I DON'T KNOW, YOU'RE JUST CONDESCENDING TOWARDS ME. CONDESCENDING? YOU MUST BE CRAZY. I'M NOT DOING NOTHING. Jonathan: I DON'T LIKE TO POINT FINGERS AND PLAY THIS *BLEEP* GAME. WERE NOT GOING TO SEE EYE-TO-EYE ON EVERYTHING, BUT I DON'T GIVE A *BLEEP* I DON'T GIVE A *BLEEP* IF I EVER SEE HER AGAIN OR NOT. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE TRYING TO SURVIVE. YOU ARE VERY GOOD -- I'M KEEPING US BOTH ALIVE. YOU'VE -- I KNOW. HOW? YOU'RE NOT KEEPING US BOTH ALIVE. WERE KEEPING EACH OTHER ALIVE. YOU KEEP BRAGGING AND BRAGGING EVERY DAY. YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE MISS KNOW-IT-ALL, AND I GIVE YOU THAT RESPECT. YOU DO KNOW A LOT. DO I? YEAH, YOU COME OFF THAT WAY. Alison: IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR ME BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'VE HAD TO NOT ONLY KIND OF BE A LEADER, BUT TO ALSO BE A TEACHER. I'M JUST SAYING, IF I HADN'T HAVE BEEN HERE, WOULD YOU STILL BE HERE? WHY IS THAT -- THAT'S A STUPID QUESTION. IF YOU WEREN'T HERE, WOULD I SURVIVE WITH-- OF COURSE I COULD SURVIVE. SHE DOESN'T REALIZE MY DEFINITION OF SURVIVAL IS SOMEBODY SHOOTING AT ME AND ME SHOOTING BACK AND SURVIVING AFTER THAT. Alison: SO THIS IS A CHALLENGE FOR ME RIGHT NOW TO DO WHAT I THINK IS SMART. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE JUST AS MUCH OF A SURVIVAL EXPERT AS I AM. NO, I'M NOT. I TOLD YOU STRAIGHT UP FROM THE BEGINNING, I'M A CITY BOY. I'M IN THE MILITARY. THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE? WHY AM I HERE? 'CAUSE I HAVE MY MILITARY TRAINING AND SURVIVAL SKILLS FROM THE MILITARY. BUT THEN YOU LIED THAT -- I DIDN'T LIE ABOUT NOTHING. Jonathan: HER DEFINITION OF SURVIVAL AND MY DEFINITION OF SURVIVAL ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS, AND SHE NEEDS TO PUT THAT *BLEEP* BEHIND HER AND MOVE ON. HE DOESN'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO BE OUT HERE. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE JUST AS MUCH OF SURVIVAL EXPERT AS I AM. NO, I'M NOT. I TOLD YOU STRAIGHT UP FROM THE BEGINNING, I'M A CITY BOY. Narrator: AFTER SURVIVING 12 DAYS ON THE MALDIVES ISLANDS WITH RECORD TEMPERATURES INTO THE 120s, JONATHAN AND ALISON'S RELATIONSHIP IS AT AN ALL-TIME LOW. I DON'T WANT TO OVERWHELM YOU, BUT SOMETIMES I'M JUST TALKING OUT. YOU'RE NOT GONNA OVERWHELM ME. YOU'RE OVERWHELMING YOURSELF. TRY MY BEST TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER. HE MAY NOT BE MY IDEAL PARTNER HERE, BUT AT LEAST HE'S SOMEONE. Narrator: JONATHAN IGNORED ALISON'S WARNINGS ABOUT DRINKING BAD WELL WATER... Jonathan: WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE EYE TO EYE ON EVERYTHING, BUT I DON'T GIVE A *BLEEP* I DON'T GIVE A *BLEEP* IF I EVER SEE HER AGAIN OR NOT. RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO SURVIVE. Narrator: ...AND, AS A RESULT, IS STRICKEN WITH SICKNESS AND DIARRHEA. Alison: I DON'T WANT HIM TO LEAVE, BUT I'D RATHER HE LEAVE THAN BE HERE AND BE A BURDEN ON ME IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING I'M TRYING TO DO TO SURVIVE. Narrator: NOW REDUCED TO A DIET OF COCONUTS AND NONI LEAVES, THEY'RE DESPERATE FOR A SOURCE OF PROTEIN. LET'S JUST GET DOWN TO THE CORAL REEF AT THE END AND START LOOKING FOR EELS AND FISH. Alison: WE'RE SO HUNGRY FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN A COCONUT. Jonathan: WE'RE BOTH STARVING. COCONUTS ARE NOT DOING IT NO MORE. AND PLUS I DON'T WANT TO GET SICK BY HAVING ANY MORE. WE NEED TO GET SOME PROTEIN AND ENERGY IN US. Alison: WE HAVE NO FOOD. Jonathan: WE BOTH NEED TO FOCUS ON PROTEIN BECAUSE IT'S GONNA KEEP US GOING. I CAN PROBABLY GO DOWN WHERE THE REEF IS POPPING OUT OF THE WATER A LITTLE BIT AND TRY MY NOOSE, AND YOU CAN GO WHEREVER YOU WANT. Alison: I JUST CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW LITTLE SEA LIFE THERE REALLY IS ON THIS ISLAND. Narrator: INCREASING LOCAL WATER TEMPERATURES HAVE KILLED OFF MUCH OF THE CORAL, CAUSING THE FISH POPULATION TO DECLINE. YEP, HE'S EATING MY CRAB LEG. THAT IS THE FIRST FISH I'VE SEEN. IT LOOKS LIKE SOME SORT OF EEL. WE'RE SO HUNGRY FOR PROTEIN, CATCHING THIS EEL IS GONNA BE A MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH TO US. OH, MY GOSH. THE NUMBER-ONE RULE I WAS TAUGHT AS A CHILD GROWING UP IN A TROPICAL ENVIRONMENT IS STAY AWAY FROM THE EELS. Narrator: EELS ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE. THEY SHELTER IN THE CREVICES OF THE CORAL, WAITING IN THE SHADOWS TO AMBUSH THEIR PREY. THEY POSSESS STRONG JAWS AND SHARP TEETH AND ARE KNOWN TO ATTACK HUMANS IF THEY FEEL THREATENED. Jonathan: IT LOOKS LIKE ALISON'S GOT HER EYES ON SOMETHING. WHATEVER I SEE, I'M GONNA KILL. I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS HUNGRY. Alison: JUST RUNNING ON THIS STUFF IS SUPER CHALLENGING. IT'S, LIKE, RAZOR SHARP. PROBABLY THE SHARPEST CORAL I'VE EVER WALKED ON. SHARP-ASS CORAL, DUDE. DUDE THIS STUFF IS LIKE RAZORS. IT'S NOT WORTH CUTTING OUR FEET OVER FOR. WHERE IS THAT THING? THIS ISN'T WORTH CUTTING MY FEET OVER. HOLY CRAP! THERE IT IS! *BLEEP* AAH! I CUT MY FOOT. GET THAT *BLEEP* I GOT IT, I GOT IT, I GOT IT. COME *BLEEP* *BLEEP* *BLEEP* *BLEEP* GET HIM? MM. ARE YOU OKAY? I GOT HIM. GOT MYSELF TOO. HE TRIED TO BITE ME. CHOP HIS HEAD OFF. DON'T YOU DARE FRICKING GO AWAY. YOU'RE MY DINNER. ON RAZOR SHARP CORAL, THAT'S A LOT HARDER THAN YOU'D THINK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU GOT ME, BUT THANK YOU. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I'M SORRY I HAD TO DO THAT. OH, I DON'T LIKE KILLING THINGS. I REALLY DON'T' LIKE KILLING THINGS. I'M SO SORRY. Jonathan: WE'RE MORE THAN HALFWAY THROUGH THE CHALLENGE. DURING THIS PROCESS, ALL THE WEIGHTS BEEN PUT ON ALISON'S SHOULDERS. MY TEAMMATE STEPPED IT UP, AND I'M VERY PROUD OF HER. THANK YOU, EEL. AFTER SHE KILLED THAT EEL, I LOOKED DEEP INSIDE MYSELF AND RECOGNIZED THAT EVEN SOMEONE WITH A STRONG MILITARY BACKGROUND, I'M THE ONE WHO'S BEEN PLAYING A SUBORDINATE ROLE HERE. ALISON IS THE ONE WHO REALLY DESERVES ALL THE CREDIT. SHOULD WE JUST PUT HIM ON? YEAH. HERE, READY? IT'S COOKING FAST. I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HER. I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING SHE'S DONE OUT HERE. Alison: I CAN FEEL THE PROTEIN JUST FLOWING THROUGH MY BODY. I'M FEELING REALLY FRUSTRATED BY MY INJURIES AND OVERALL REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF. AND THAT'S NOT WHO I AM. THIS MORNING, I'M GONNA TRY TO GO FISHING. MY CHANCE TO HUNT FOR MYSELF IS A GOOD CHANCE TO PROVE TO HER THAT I CAN DO IT ON MY OWN. I'M READY TO RISK DANGEROUS WATERS TO DO IT. AND I'LL COME BACK WITH SOME TREASURES. I'M LOOKING FOR CLAMS. I THINK IT'S A GREAT CHANCE FOR TO PROVE TO HER THAT I CAN DO IT ON MY OWN, THAT I'M A GOOD PARTNER. AND I FIND A HUGE CLAM. IT TAKES PATIENCE AND A LITTLE SKILL AND A LOT OF ENERGY TO CHISEL IT OUT, BUT I MANAGED TO GET IT. Alison: YEAH, WHOO-HOO! Alison: THAT WAS EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE. I'M THINKING I'M PRETTY EXCITED BECAUSE JONATHAN JUST PULLED THIS CLAM OUT WITH HIS BARE HANDS. THAT WAS THE BEST THING SO FAR. THERE ARE VERY, VERY RARE MOMENTS WHEN SUPER-HUMAN POWER POPS INTO PLAY DURING A SURVIVAL CHALLENGE, AND WHEN JONATHAN GOT THAT CLAM, THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS. I THINK I WANT TO GIVE YOU A HUG. AHH. OW. SUNBURN. SORRY, SORRY. OH, MY GOSH. Jonathan: FOR THE FIRST TIME, I'M FEELING LIKE I'M REALLY CONTRIBUTING. AND BY CATCHING THAT CLAM, I REALLY IMPROVED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ME AND ALISON. COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER PARTNER. SHE'S AWESOME. END UP PROBABLY BECOMING BEST FRIENDS. WE HAVE A CLAM, AND I'M HAPPY AS A CLAM. I'M JUST EXCITED TO BE WORKING AS A TEAM. IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD. I THINK WE'RE FINALLY MESHING, AND NOT THAT I WANT TO STAY HERE LONGER, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY COOL TO SEE US COMING TOGETHER. HOLY COW. NOW, THIS ISLAND MIGHT LOOK LIKE A POSTCARD, BUT THIS IS LITERALLY THE ISLAND FROM HELL. THIS SUCKS. I HATE IT HERE. Jonathan: WE POPPED OPEN A COCONUT, AND I'M ACTUALLY VERY HAPPY THAT SHE KNEW HOW TO DO IT. SHE TAUGHT ME HOW TO DO IT CORRECTLY, 'CAUSE I WOULD'VE KEPT HITTING THE BACK END OF THE COCONUT. OH, THAT'S PRIMO. MMM-MMM-MMM-MMM. IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE THE WATER'S A LAXATIVE, BUT THE MEAT IS A... IS A BULK, YOU KNOW? SO IT'S SUCH A SMART FRUIT. IT KNOWS. LOVELY. WELL DONE. WELL DONE. I REALLY DON'T LIKE KILLING THINGS. I'M SO SORRY. Narrator: ALISON AND JONATHAN HAVE NOW BEEN SURVIVING ON THE MALDIVES ISLANDS FOR OVER 18 DAYS. I GOT CUT. TOGETHER, THEY'RE BRAVING THE TOUGH CONDITIONS OF THE ISLAND -- OVER-100-DEGREE HEAT, LACK OF WATER, AND DANGEROUS FISH ON THE REEF. Alison: HE TRIED TO BITE ME. THROUGH ALL THEIR ADVERSITY, THEY'VE FOUGHT PAST THEIR PERSONAL DIFFERENCES AND HAVE COME TOGETHER AS A TEAM. I THINK I WANT TO GIVE YOU A HUG. OW. SUNBURN. SORRY, SORRY. WHOA, LIGHTNING! THAT'S CLOSE. Alison: THERE'S A STORM COMING. SEE THESE LEAVES BEHIND ME? THE COCOAS. Narrator: AFTER SURVIVING WEEKS IN PUNISHING CONDITIONS, THEY FACE ANOTHER THREAT AS A POWERFUL AND DANGEROUS STORM APPROACHES. UNPROTECTED AND VULNERABLE, JONATHAN AND ALISON HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE FORCE OF NATURE AT ITS MOST VIOLENT. Alison: HOLY COW. OH, I JUST LITERALLY RAN ALMOST ALL THE WAY AROUND THE ISLAND 'CAUSE I SAW THIS HUGE STORM COMING IN. HOLY COW. Jonathan: NOW WE'RE GONNA BE MORE MISERABLE, MORE COLD, AND MORE HUNGRY AND HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ENERGY TO GET THE *BLEEP* OFF THIS ISLAND. WE HAVE TWO MORE DAYS LEFT, AND WE STILL HAVE TO SWIM OUT TO A MAJOR CHANNEL. NOW WE'RE FINALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO FINISH OFF STRONG, AND IT'S HARD. IT'S REALLY COLD. Jonathan: SHE'S FREEZING. SHE'S TINIER THAN I AM, YOU KNOW, AND I'M COLD RIGHT NOW, TOO. IF I'M BITCHING IT'S COLD, THEN IT'S COLD, BECAUSE I USUALLY DON'T BITCH. THE ONLY THING WE HAVE LEFT TO KEEP WARM IS OUR BODY HEAT AND JUST STAY INSIDE THE SHELTER. I JUST PRAY IT'S GONNA HOLD UP. THIS IS JUST LIKE PUTTING SALT IN THE WOUND. NOW WE JUST GOT TO SIT THROUGH IT AND KILL TIME AND WAIT AND WAIT AND WAIT AND NOT THINK ABOUT FOOD AND NOT THINK ABOUT HUNGER. THE NIGHT BRINGS ONE OF THE WORST STORMS THE MALDIVES HAVE EXPERIENCED IN YEARS WITH WINDS OF UP TO 70 MILES PER HOUR. GOSH. FREEZING. WE'RE EXPERIENCING A REALLY, REALLY BIG STORM RIGHT NOW. IT'S LIKE 4:00 IN THE MORNING, AND IT HASN'T STOPPED ALL NIGHT. THIS IS THE FIRST STORM I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN GENUINELY SCARED THAT WE'RE GONNA LOSE OUR SHELTER. I SERIOUSLY THINK THESE ARE LIKE 70-MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS. NO, I'M SERIOUS. I THINK IT'S GONNA BLOW AWAY. I WANT TO GO HOME. OOH. THE STORM NOW HEADS INTO ITS THIRD DAY AND GROWS INCREASINGLY VIOLENT. THIS IS THE WILDEST STORM WE'VE HAD YET. YOU LOSE MOST OF YOUR BODY HEAT THROUGH YOUR HEAD, SO I'M TRYING TO PUT EVERYTHING I CAN FIND OVER MY HEAD. Jonathan: I'D RATHER SAVE MY ENERGY OR THE LAST DAY, WHICH IS TOMORROW, TO BUILD THAT RAFT AND GET OFF THIS ISLAND. WE CAN MAKE A RAFT. I SAW PLENTY OF WASHED-UP WATER BOTTLES WE CAN STUFF INSIDE HER BAIT TRAP, AND IT'LL DEFINITELY HOLD BOTH OF US UP. Alison: IF IT'S ROUGH LIKE THIS, WE AREN'T GONNA BE ABLE TO SWIM OUT TO OUR PICK-UP SPOT. I FEEL LIKE THE ISLAND'S ABOUT TO BLOW AWAY. THIS THING HELD UP, THANK GOD. YAY! YAY! WE ARE GONNA EAT TODAY, FINALLY. WE'RE OUT OF STARVATION CAMP. WE ARE GONNA GET OFF THIS ISLAND AND HAVE OUR COOKIES. CHOCOLATE. Alison: IT'S DAY 21. THE SUN FINALLY CAME OUT, AND I CAN'T STOP SMILING. OKAY, SO, WE ARE RIGHT HERE. WHILE THE BOAT SHOULD BE GOING THIS DIRECTION. WE JUST GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE ANOTHER STORM HITS. THE LAST THREE NIGHTS HERE WERE EXTREMELY BRUTAL. WE WEREN'T SURE WE WERE GONNA MAKE IT. Jonathan: IT'S PERFECT. Jonathan: WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING OFF THIS ISLAND. Alison: OW. GEEZ. OW. WHY'D YOU PULL IT OUT? HEY, I THINK I SEE THE BOAT. WHERE? RIGHT THERE. HI! HI! Alison: I CAME INTO THIS CHALLENGE WANTING A SORT OF COMING-OF-AGE EXPERIENCE AND I THINK I GOT THAT AND EVEN MORE. Jonathan: IT FEELS SO GOOD TO FINALLY GET PICKED UP BY THE RESCUE BOAT AND BE DONE WITH THE 21-DAY CHALLENGE. I FEEL SO RELIEVED THAT'S FINALLY OVER. WITHOUT ALISON, THIS TRIP WOULD'VE BEEN EVEN MORE MISERABLE. I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR HER, AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY OTHER WOMAN OUT THERE THAT I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE THAT HAS THE TALENT AND SKILLS THAT SHE HAS. Alison: THANK YOU, JONATHAN, FOR BEING MY PARTNER HERE. BYE-BYE! THIS CHALLENGE IS THE MOST DIFFICULT THING I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE. PUT HER THERE. MY HAT'S OFF TO YOU. LOT OF RESPECT. MAINLY, WHAT I'M SITTING HERE THINKING IS, "HOW THE HECK WILL I EVER EXPLAIN HOW BRUTALLY CHALLENGING "AND RIDICULOUSLY EXHAUSTING AND INCREDIBLY AMAZING THIS EXPERIENCE REALLY WAS?" Narrator: AFTER 21 DAYS, JONATHAN AND ALISON HAVE GONE THROUGH A MENTAL AND PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION LIKE NO OTHER. JONATHAN LOST A TOTAL OF 18 POUNDS AND ALISON, 14 POUNDS. JONATHAN IS BACK IN LOS ANGELES, TRAINING FOR TRIATHLONS AND WORKING AS A BODYGUARD. AND ALISON RETURNED TO HAWAII TO BE WITH FAMILY AND IS PLANNING HER NEXT ADVENTURE. SURVIVAL EXPERTS REVIEWED JONATHAN AND ALISON IN TERMS OF THEIR SKILL, EXPERIENCE, AND MENTAL APPROACH AND REASSESSED THEM BOTH ACCORDING TO HOW THEY COPED WITH THEIR SITUATION. JONATHAN SHOWED IMMENSE MENTAL STRENGTH GETTING THROUGH HIS INJURIES. BUT THIS CHALLENGE WAS WAY BEYOND ANYTHING HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED. ALISON'S TREMENDOUS KNOWLEDGE OF PLANT LIFE HELPED KEEP THEM BOTH ALIVE WHEN OTHERWISE THEY WOULD'VE FAILED. TEAMWORK LET THEM BOTH DOWN AT THE START. BUT REALIZING THEIR SURVIVAL DEPENDED ON THEM WORKING TOGETHER ULTIMATELY SAVED THEM. OVERALL THEIR PSRs IMPROVED. JONATHAN'S PSR IS NOW 7.2, WHILE ALISON GETS AN 8.4. THIS EXPERIENCE PROVES THAT JONATHAN AND ALISON HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO SURVIVE NAKED AND AFRAID. YOU HAVE TO BE A HARDCORE SURVIVALIST TO FINISH OUT HERE ON YOUR OWN. THIS IS NO JOKE.
