 [hailey] this altitude is kicking my butt. [sobs] you feeling all right? - You really... - [hailey] excuse me for a second. Sure. [coughs, retching] [hailey] I don't even have anything left to throw up. [retching] damn it! [retching and coughing] [screaming]

 there's nothing easy about this. [screaming] we got hail! [animal growling] whew! My heart's racing! You don't fight, you won't make it. I tried so hard! [hailey] I cannot take another minute of this. As we get higher and higher in elevation. The air is thinner. Gonna get colder and that's making me a little bit nervous here. [hailey] rocks! Rocks, rocks, rocks. I hope I don't slip and fall down this mountain.

 [narrator] the colorado rockies are 79,000 square miles of rugged, high altitude terrain. With peaks rising nearly three miles above sea level. The dry mountain air contains 40% less oxygen at these extreme elevations which can result in labored breathing, fatigue, and accelerated dehydration. Some of the trees out here have got claw marks running down them. Towards the base. That's normally a sign that bears are pawing at the tree. A little bit nerve racking in these situations. [narrator] in the late summer, black bears search for up to 20,000 calories a day, as they prepare for the long winter. These aggressive omnivores can grow up to 700 pounds. And can run 30 miles per hour. It's another trail that looks like it's been struck by lightning maybe. Yeah, that's definitely charred wood. [narrator] this time of year is also monsoon season, unpredictable weather produces an endless assault of violent lightning and hail storms. And temperatures can plummet into the low 40s at night. I'm seeing a lot of beautiful things here, but I'm also a little nervous, I'm not gonna lie. [danny] my name is danny and I'm from portland, oregon. Right now I live in the high deserts of south central washington. I would describe myself as a goofball. Welcome to my hillbilly bathtub! You think you have room for one more in there? Oh, yeah! The water's fine, come on in. [laughing] I home stead with my girlfriend sarah bartell. One of the naked and afraid all stars. She survived not only a 21-day challenge in ecuador. Timber! Whoo! But the 40-day challenge in africa. Ah. That's catfish. - It's gonna be cold at night, - probably. Are you gonna have to cuddle? - Yeah. - Okay. - We're gonna have to. - [laughs] [danny] I'm a homesteader and in that lifestyle, there's a lot of work to be done. All right, who's ready to feed some critters? Time to play with fire! Many things that I do in my daily life at home have prepared me for this challenge. This right here is the long bow that I made. I don't have all these luxuries that the modern world is used to and I think those aspects of my daily life have given me a huge advantage, mentally, on how I'm going to take this challenge. [narrator] danny knows what it takes to survive off the grid. But the region's unpredictable weather could seriously test his confidence and skills. Danny starts his challenge with a primitive survival rating of 7.0. [danny] I think what drives me to put myself in this situation is the desire to go out in the woods, only a few basic tools and get what I need to survive and thrive. [hailey] I can reach on top. Every time I think that it keeps going somehow. Elevation is going to be horrible out here! [hailey] my name is hailey, I'm from roanoke rapids, north carolina. I'm a single mom, I have two kids. Sitting here, thinking about all the things I'm gonna miss the most while I'm out. What do you think about me going on naked and afraid? I'm supporting you. I've been a survivalist as long as I can remember. I would run behind my dad the second I saw him getting together his hunting or his fishing gear. I was always raised out in the woods. I definitely found my, my peace and happiness out among the trees. Oh my gosh! I'm so on the edge of a mountain right now. I consider myself creative as far as trying to figure out different ways to acquire food. And we just found a tomato caesar mushroom. I'm gonna eat it! I'm confident in hunting and trapping, and finding fresh water. I've been underestimated my whole life by some of the men in my family. I'm doing this challenge just to prove to my dad and to my family that I'm a lot tougher than they think I am and it's not just a man's job that I can handle but it's all around aspects of anything. Just want to push myself further than I could ever imagine. [narrator] hailey's connection with nature and her ability to overcome adversity is a proven asset. But she's never attempted to survive outside of her hometown and lacks experience with high altitude. She begins the challenge with a psr of 6.0. I'm ready to rock this challenge out. All right. This is where the trail ends. Well, I guess it's my time to shine. I'm completely comfortable with being nude. I sleep nude every night. I don't wear underwear. But when I started stripping, it set in. I was a lot more nervous than I thought I would be. All right. Let's get started. [danny] I take this kilt with me lots of places. It's just really liberating to wear no underwear. Here we are! Back in my birthday suit. Time to get rolling. Oof. I'm already noticing the air is much thinner up here. Can't wait to see who I've got with me on this... This wild ride! Hello there, traveler! Hey! [danny] I see you've lost your clothes too. Yeah, they're somewhere out here, maybe you can help me find them. We'll see. - Good to meet you. My name is danny. - Good to meet you too. My name is hailey. Pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you. Where are you from? Uh, I'm originally from portland, oregon. Okay. And where were you from exactly? I'm from north carolina. I noticed you had an accent. Yeah, well, I get that a lot even at home. [chuckles] hopefully you can teach me about some of the trees around this way. We don't have these in north carolina. Yeah, absolutely, I've got a pretty good idea of most of the plants here. I'm also a little nervous. I'm not gonna lie. [hailey] I am too. Yeah. Now, let's get started, shall we? Yeah. [danny] we've got a lot of wind picking up now. I do hope it's not gonna be this windy tonight. [hailey] oh, yeah. [danny] I think that one is yours. - [hailey] thank you. - This one's mine. Ah! I'm so glad we got a pot! Stoked about that. [narrator] at high altitude, the body loses water twice as fast. So, hailey and danny have been given a pot to boil water and each brought along a personal item. A knife and a fire starter. Oh! Beautiful! [hailey] so, we'll be able to get fire pretty quickly I also brought my glasses because I'm blind as a bat of course. Then we have the map. [danny] ooh! [hailey] let's check it out. Oh, it looks like we're at this great big tree here. [danny] looks like we've got a game trail following down that at tree too. I bet that'll lead us right to the watering hole. Ooh! We got some predators in the area. I see bear. [hailey] yeah, I see some snakes. Definitely gonna wanna steer clear of those. All right, let's check it out. - Cool. Let's rock this challenge. - Follow it down. [hailey] keep your eyes peeled for rattle snakes. They will blend right into the scene. They love this timber too. [danny] yeah, they do. The young ones don't always warn you either. [narrator] juvenile rattle snakes are highly venomous. But are born without a rattle. New rattles develop every time they shed their skin [hailey] look, this is baneberry. They get that black spot at the bottom. That's how you know ah, where I come from, they grow red, but, you're right, they can be white as well. I just remember reading and learning about these white ones. In fact, for general hygiene if we need to was our hands after dropping a dump, that's going to be our go-to. Cool! [hailey] danny is a little quirky, but I'm extremely grateful to have a partner that's so knowledged in herbs. What I don't know, he will. And I feel like it's really going to help us as a team. [danny] when I was about 20 years old, I took a solo backpacking trip to australia. Oh, that's awesome. I've never been... I-I'd actually never been out of north carolina until now. Whoo-wee! So... I couldn't imagine going to a whole another country, that must have been an amazing experience. [danny] kind of questionable that she's never left her state before, but hailey is easy to talk to and she knows a lot about plants which I'm really stoked about. [danny] look at this. I'm noticing a lot of these trees around here are blown up by lightning strikes. [hailey] oh, yeah. They're dead. [hailey] oh, that thunder is rolling in quick. We're gonna have to find a shelter soon. I hate to get stuck out in the storm. [hailey] it's hailing. It's so cold! [danny] I expected some extreme situations, but I did not think I was gonna get thunder storms, rain, and hail all coming down on me before I can even find camp. [hailey] slippery! - [danny] this is really insane. - [hailey sighs] [danny] ow! [breathes heavily] [danny] we need to find a place to make shelter soon. [hailey] this is not north carolina. [danny] ooh! [hailey] take me home. [exhales heavily] [hailey] I'm starting to get worried. [danny] right now, we really need to focus on fire and shelter. [hailey] that wind just got so much worse. [hailey] whew! It's getting cold, quick. [both gasp] [danny] the clouds are starting break. Thank god. [speaking] [hailey] yeah, we get another hail storm, might be a little getting on the risk of hypothermia ooh! Look! I think this our pool that's on our map. [danny] it looks clear. [hailey] yeah, and it looks like it's running all the way up there, so I bet these are our two pools. I can't complain about clear water. We've got a pot. We'll boil it. We'll be in business. [hailey] I agree. [danny] I've got a good feeling about hailey. She's the kind of person you can really work with. [danny] what do you think of this spot for our shelter? [hailey] it's got a good flat area. It's got some good trees to build off of. I wouldn't be opposed to it. [danny] a really thick walled debris shelter is gonna be our best bet to stay warm. In a debris shelter you get surrounded by leaves. That is how your body is going to hold its heat. [hailey] I would rather do an a-frame. That way we could actually have fire in the shelter. [danny] what we could do is heat up rocks from our fire and line the inside every single night. [hailey] or we could do two shelters in between both of these trees and put our fire in the middle of us. [danny] let's build one of those debris shelters and focus on that. Just so we'll have a place to sleep tonight. Okay. [hailey] he wants to do a debris shelter. He seems to be okay with just leaves on us. I don't think a debris shelter is going to be best in this cold situation. [danny] we also have to get as much elevation off the cold ground as we can. [hailey] yeah, the earth will steal three degrees of body heat from you every hour. [danny] good to know. Let's get started, shall we? All right, sounds good. [danny] timber! Ooh! [danny] I'm gathering medium sized branches to build the horizontal framework. [narrator] a debris shelter relies on packing it full of dry leaves and other highly combustible material that act as insulation from the cold. But leaves no room to safely build a fire inside. Whew! You feeling all right? Yeah, I'm trying to catch my breath. Cutting them limbs down this altitude is kicking my butt. [danny] yeah, yeah. Hailey, she does not have much experience being in alpine environments like this. I'm really hoping that she does not end up getting altitude sickness because that could be a huge issue and I really wanna work with my partner and not carry them through this challenge. [hailey] I'm gonna try to get this fire because it's starting to get pretty cold. Fire is dire out here, it is a 100% necessity. I don't trust the water here so we need this fire, so we can boil the water and stay hydrated. Elevation sickness isn't really something you can combat other than just drinking a lot of water. [sighs] it's extremely frustrating, this is so frustrating I feel like I am pulling all the the magnesium off of the starter at this point. [danny] how are you feeling? [hailey] ugh, I'm all right. Still pretty nauseous. Oh, I hate nausea. I feel like death. Which is really not what I wanted for this challenge. Not once did it cross my mind that the altitude is going to bother me. [hailey] it's not working out too well. I mean it literally hailed and stormed before we got here. Us having difficulties getting fire going doesn't surprise me. So, let's focus on getting this shelter completed and hopefully if we have a little bit of daylight, we can try to get a fire going after that. [hailey] okay. [hailey] I really wanna get a fire tonight and danny is really not worried about it. This is colorado and it's gonna get cold. [danny speaking] [hailey speaking] fire! - [hailey] oh my gosh! Yes! - [danny] yes! [whoops] fire! Yee-haw! [bleep] yeah! We got fire! - High five, dude. Good job! - [danny] thank you so much. Oh, man. [danny] we've got our debris hut made. We've got our fire on. [hailey] now we get some water boiling. [danny] yes. [hailey] we've got fire! [laughs] I'm not going to freeze to death tonight. But, it'd be a christmas miracle if we ain't cold out here. [laughs] [danny speaking] [hailey] the rocks are hot, be careful. [danny] oh, yeah. That's hot. I'm really proud with how far we've gotten on the first day. I am too. We've made a good team so far. Yeah, we absolutely have. [danny] oh! That was looking dark for a second there. Whew! [shivering] [hailey] the rocks aren't working. [danny] I don't mind if your arm is around me. It'll keep... [shivers] keep us both a little warmer. [hailey] oh, my god! It is so cold. [danny] tomorrow will be much better. [narrator] weather patterns and temperatures in the area are largely controlled by elevation. At night, the colder air from the peaks above come rushing down dropping summer temperatures into the 40s. [hailey] maybe we should go lay by the fire. [danny speaking] [bleep] [hailey speaking] [hailey exhales and sniffles] [hailey coughs and retches] [hailey puking] [hailey] last night was the longest night of my life. I though I was gonna die any minute, just go to sleep and not wake back up. [sniffles] I was up shivering and puking. The numbness is hard to get over. I've had some [bleep] nights in the wild and that was one of the tops. [hailey] nothing prepares you for this cold. And it's only gonna get colder. I don't wanna leave, but I cannot take another minute of this. [danny] we could relocate. All the cold air comes down from the hills and focuses into this valley here. But do you think it's practical, we could scout out another area and build a whole shelter in the time before it would be storming or getting cold again? [danny] it won't, probably won't be till noon when it gets really warm here [hailey] I'mma try to stay out here a little bit longer. See if I can't warm up some. [danny] got it. I'm gonna see if I can find an oak grove, get some acorns. I'm gonna see if I can find a spot for a better shelter. [danny] I believe my partner is considering tapping out. But I think it is within everybody to push themselves further. Even in desperate situations like this. [hailey] good luck. [danny] thank you and I hope you feel better soon. [danny] I do not want to spend another night the way that we did last night. That was brutal. You don't want to be on top of a hill, but you don't want to be in the valley. You want to find somewhere right in between where the cold air doesn't sink but the harsh winds don't blow on you all night. However, we still need to be close to our water source, which of course is at the bottom of that valley. [hailey puking] [puking and coughing] I'm not ready to give up. [sobbing] I don't get to give up in my mom life and I'm not gonna give up out here either. But, I can't afford to lose any more fluids. [danny] I got a surprise for us. Oh, yeah? Whole bunch of acorns. Well, unfortunately I've been throwing up, so... Damn it! Elevation sickness is kicking my ass a little bit worse today than it was yesterday. [danny] that's bad news. I didn't see any good locations on my hike either. [hailey] so that means we're in for another cold night and I'm already sick. This elevations sickness is something to be reckoned with. I'm so nauseous, that I keep throwing up. My stomach's upset. My head feels like it's gonna explode and my eyeballs are just gonna pop out of my head. But, gotta keep pushing, it's the only way you're gonna get anything done. [danny] I think I'm gonna pop a couple of these, right now, just to put something in my stomach. How are you doing? [hailey] I could not imagine eating right now. I can't even take water without throwing back up. - [danny] [bleep], really? - [hailey] excuse me for second. Sure. [retching] [bleep] that's bad. [narrator] at elevations above 8000 feet there are fewer oxygen molecules in the air. This results in less oxygen flow throughout the body, affecting muscles, cognitive functions and the body's ability to hydrate. [danny] it seems like her symptoms have gotten worse and it's hard when your partner is suffering and there is nothing you can do it about it. I don't even have anything left to throw up. [breathing heavily] [narrator] with hailey's condition worsening, the medic arrives to asses her situation. [medic] how many times would you say you've vomited? Total I've vomited over 20 times today. Okay, I'm gonna run some vital signs on you. [medic] your heart rate is pretty elevated right now. She looks really bad right now. Blood pressure was really elevated, nausea, vomiting. This is a good indication of severe dehydration. She can end up with kidney failure, neurological deficits. Do you have a little bit of concern with the altitude sickness? I don't feel like this is a safe environment for you right now. It's only gonna keep progressing and become deadly for you. For that I'm gonna have to tap you out. Okay? - [sobs] -yeah, I'm sorry I have to do this. [sniffles] [danny] you should be proud that you've toughed it out this long. If I had altitude sickness and I-I knew it was altitude sickness. I probably would have tapped myself out. You're a tough chick. [hailey] it just really sucks. Well, I know you're gonna make it the full 21, so... I'm gonna try my best. - [hailey] be safe. - I will. - [danny] feel better soon. Me too -[hailey] I'm glad I met you. - [medic] you feeling okay? - I feel like I'm gonna puke again. If you need to puke, we can stop. [narrator] only two days in, hailey is unable to adapt to the altitude. She is medically removed from the challenge. Her psr drops to 4.2. - You need to take a second? - Yeah. Okay, take a second. [hailey] I came out here to take some peace home. And I'm not leaving with any. I'm leaving with more, um, regret. Now, I'm gonna be alone tonight. To lose a good partner... I mean the loneliness is one thing. But, the work load, I've got firewood to process, I've got water to boil. I've got shelters to reinforce I've got all sorts of tasks I need to do just to stay alive. And what's worse is, it's going to be freezing temperatures. [danny] I really don't want to, uh, even attempt lying down and sleeping without some heat source near me. I'll be using more of those stones, the thicker ones this time, to give myself much more heat in the shelter than we had last night. Here you go. Okay, I got all my stones. Wish me luck. Okay. Oh, now, it's [bleep] cold again. [danny] it is so cold right now, I had to start a fire again. 'cause once those stones got cold, it really just wasn't worth it staying in there. I really hope I don't have to subject my body to this... Again. Because it's clear, it's gonna be another sleepless night. I really don't... [bleep] it's absolutely freezing. I can't keep on doing this. [danny] so, last night, didn't sleep at all. I feel horrible. My first night alone without my partner hailey here with me. Missing the body heat was rough. So, I need to go get some really dry, fluffy oak leaves. To insulate my shelter with. Kind of material I'm looking for my plan is to stuff the entire thing like a burrito. No air spaces, all those leaves surrounding my body are gonna give me the best insulation I could hope for out here. 'cause that is what makes the difference might not be comfortable, but you will survive. [danny] ugh, that's much better. It's starting to warm up in here. [danny] my shelter was quite a bit better than last night. It's very efficient, especially once it's stuffed with leaves. I think my girlfriend, sarah, would be really proud of me for... This badass shelter, staying positive, thinking things through logically. Uh... Oh, man. Now I miss home. [bleep] on my big toe, I've got a huge crack in the skin. From all this dry weather and not having any shoes on and that can be a big problem later on. [narrator] at this elevation, the mountain air is colder and drier, making skin more susceptible to cracking and infection. [danny] I'm going to use some sap from conifer trees to clean up my wound. The sap, which is not only anti-bacterial, but it's also very tacky. So it helps the wound stay sealed and it also prevent things like dust or grit from really getting into the wound. If you don't have your feet, you can't survive. Especially alone. So, now I can focus on food. [danny] acorns are the majority of what my diet's consisted of since coming out here. Ooh! But I definitely need to supplement with something better. Worms, fry them up, have a nice little snack before nap time. Mmm, just like mommy used to make. It's like a potato chip. Mm! [brays] [danny] the cut on my toe keeps opening, so I really need to make some sandals if I wanna make good progress out here. To make those sandals, I'm gonna need a couple willow rods, about six foot each and I will need some courtage. And away we go! [bleep] snake! [snake hissing] it's not a rattlesnake. Hell yeah! That is protein on the table oh, look at that. I'm imagining this is a rat snake. [narrator] rat snakes are constrictors, coiling around their prey to subdue them. Some do have small traces of venom, but are not harmful to humans. [laughs] [grunts] so, I'm excited for this. [danny] snake for dinner tonight. I'm so stoked about this. And you know what the best part about snakes is, tastes just like chicken. Mmm. I feel like this snake could not have come at a more perfect time for me. Every bit of protein and fat carved out of this landscape is gonna give me that much more advantage to making it 21 days. I am gonna weave this bundle of fibers up into some braided cord. I feel good right now, I feel good. I feel capable. [danny] I think I'm gonna put this on hold since I see some rough weather coming in. And I will save this for later. Getting some nesting for my shelter. I'm gonna cut this trip short. [danny] my make-shift fireplace is working pretty good right now. I've got a full pot of water I've covered these logs to minimize absorption. Worst case scenario, I've got a bomb proof shelter that I can just hide in and wait out the storm. All right, sounds like the rain is just starting to kick in. I just have to accept I'm stuck in the shelter all day. I really, really hope this does not continue into the night. [narrator] a massive storm has rolled in from the 14,000 foot peak above danny's camp. Bringing with it below freezing temperatures. [danny] I am a little disappointed in myself. I don't have enough nesting in my shelter to keep me properly warm. [speaking] and the wind and rain has continued. I've just been shelled up in my shelter here. My hands are cold, my feet are always cold. I just have to [inhales] wait. It's horrible. This [bleep] is hard. My girlfriend, sarah, warned me. Things are a little soaked right now and it started leaking on my head, leaking on my torso. I just had to keep digging into my shelter and piling up more and more leaves. It's [bleep] miserable. [narrator] without a fire, danny has been confined to his shelter, as temperatures continue to drop, hypothermia could quickly set in, so the medic checks on him every few hours. [medic] hey, danny, how you doing, bud? [danny] uh, it's gotten a bit colder. [medic] are you staying warm? [danny] my feet are cold, my body is sore, my tendons are sore and tight. But I'm not tapping out. [medic] I'm concerned. If it's to a point, where it's unbearable cold, will you promise to just let me know? [danny] yeah. [danny] it's been three days since the storm started. Can't be in here much longer. But it's too cold to go out right now. [sniffles] I need the sun, I desperately need the sun. [danny chuckles] [danny] I just had an ant bite my scrotum. [hailey chuckles] like right on the taint. [laughs] whoo-wee! Now we're camping. [hailey] ooh, do you like that? [laughs] [danny] oh, and there's that sap on my butt. Terrible roommate. I'm glad it was just a tiny little ant. [exhales sharply] poor little thing. Thank you for you life. [narrator] for three days, freezing temperatures brought on by a freak storm have held danny captive inside his debris shelter. The medic has been checking on him regularly. [medic] hey, danny. Is there a way I can take a look? I wanna make sure that you're not getting any frost bite or anything, okay? [danny] why? Just come on out. [danny] okay. My feet are frozen now. [medic] all right. [narrator] the producers provide a blanket, so that the medic can examine danny outside his shelter. In cases of moderate hypothermia, the body starts shutting down, shivering stops and consciousness becomes impaired. [medic] pressure is low, it's about 90 over 60. His oxygen saturation right now is low also. It's about 92. Current temperature right now is 93.1. [narrator] body temperature below 95 degrees is considered hypothermic and if left untreated, can lead to brain damage and cardiac failure. So these are all indications and signs of moderate hypothermia. [danny] but, I'm not tapping out. [medic] your feet are really, really cold right now. You need to get that fire going, danny, otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna be good. All right, can you do that for me? I can do that. [medic] all right. [danny] if I don't get a fire, then I will be medically tapped out. This is a tinder bundle that I hid from the storm. Very last of my bird's nests that I have. I'm really fighting the clock here. And I'm fighting my own... Dropping body temperature. Everything rests on this moment. My hands are so unsteady. [breathing heavily] [exhales] no! No, no, no. I can do this. I can do this. Come on. That's it. [sobs] [danny] everything is absolutely soaked. I tried so hard to make this fire. I suffered in that [bleep] hobbit hole for three days just lying there waiting for the sun co... To come out. I saved dry wood, I saved tinder. [inhales deeply] I tried so hard. Tried so hard! Hey, danny? We have a medical update. [medic] how do you feel right now? [danny] still can't shake the cold. Feet are still going numb. I've used up all my good tinder, nests and... There's no material nearby to replace it. Please don't tap me out. [medic] it looks like you've got some hypothermia going on. Heart rate's really low. [danny] I don't wanna fail. Tonight the weather is supposed to be getting a lot worse, it's gonna be colder than it has been since your whole time out here. And with the stage of hypothermia that you're in right now, it's serious enough to not wanna wait till it progresses any further. 'cause if it does, it could kill you. Are you forcing me to... Tap? [medic] you need to get warm. You need reheating. - I tried so hard. - You did... Danny, danny, this isn't the end of the road for you. [chris] you've proven yourself, you've proven yourself beyond what is normal. This is not about your skills. This is about your safety. This is it. This is the end of the road for this challenge. Okay. [narrator] after surviving 12 days naked in near freezing temperatures, eleven of them alone. Danny is forced from the challenge. But his psr remains a 7.0. [danny] this challenge has changed me in a way that has made me more mentally resilient. I pushed my body and my mind to the point where it almost put my life on the line. Even though my girlfriend was able to complete her challenges. It looks like mother nature had different plans for me. This storm's gotten the best of me. But I didn't tap. Given the chance, I bet I can do 21 on the next round 'cause I'm not gonna give up that easily. Oh! [groans] [danny] the rocky mountains are a wild place. And I had no idea just how bad it could get out here. We all have our limits... And, now I've learned mine.
