 [ INSECTS CHIRPING ] Clint: NOT WORTH IT. Clint: I DO NOT HAVE THE ENERGY TO WRESTLE AN ALLIGATOR. WHOA *BLEEP* HOLY CRAP! WHOA! Narrator: TWO STRANGERS... THERE'S MY PARTNER. ...ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN, BOTH EXPERIENCED SURVIVALISTS, HAVE CHOSEN TO PUT THEIR SKILLS TO THE ULTIMATE TEST. WHOO-HOO! THEY HAVE NO WATER, NO FOOD, AND NO CLOTHES.

 THEIR CHALLENGE IS TO SURVIVE FOR 21 DAYS... GOD. WE ARE SO SCREWED. ...KNOWING THAT THE HUMAN BODY CAN ONLY LIVE THREE DAYS WITHOUT WATER... WE NEED WATER, FAST. ...AND BEGINS TO SHUT DOWN AFTER THREE WEEKS WITHOUT FOOD. THIS IS THE EVEREST OF SURVIVAL CHALLENGES. CAN A MAN AND WOMAN SURVIVE ALONE IN THE WILDERNESS NAKED AND AFRAID? IT'S LIKE THE JUNGLE IS SAYING, "GET THE *BLEEP* OUT." THIS IS WHERE I'M SPENDING THE NEXT 21 DAYS COMPLETELY CUT OFF FROM CIVILIZATION. Laura: THIS IS PRETTY EXCITING. I'VE NEVER SURFED A WAVE IN A BOAT.

 [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: PANAMA, CENTRAL AMERICA. THE ISLAND OF CAYO DE AGUA LIES TO THE NORTHWEST. VIOLENT STORMS LASH THE ISLAND WITH WINDS OF UP TO 80 MILES AN HOUR AND DUMP OVER 10 FEET OF RAIN ANNUALLY. IT'S A HOT AND OPPRESSIVELY HUMID PLACE. THE SURROUNDING REEF IS HOME TO OVER 30 SPECIES OF SHARK, INCLUDING AGGRESSIVE BULL AND TIGER SHARKS. INLAND, THE BEACH QUICKLY GIVES WAY TO PUTRID SWAMP. THERE, PREDATORY CAIMAN CAN GROW TO 19 FEET. DEADLY PIT VIPERS AND BOAS LIE IN WAIT FOR ANY WARM-BLOODED PREY. MY NAME IS LAURA ZERRA, AND I'M A PRIMITIVE SURVIVALIST. I TEACH SURVIVAL SKILLS. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO PANAMA. I EXPECT RAIN, BUGS, AND ANIMALS THAT CAN PROBABLY KILL ME. THIS WILL BE THE ULTIMATE TEST OF MY SURVIVAL SKILLS, BUT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO CALL MYSELF A SURVIVALIST IF I CAN'T SURVIVE HERE. MY NAME'S CLINT JIVOIN. I'M A PRIMITIVE SURVIVALIST AND A COUNTRY-WESTERN SINGER AND SONGWRITER. I'VE NEVER LEFT THE UNITED STATES, SO I'VE NEVER BEEN TO PANAMA. I'M A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THIS ENVIRONMENT. I'M NOT USED TO HAVING VENOMOUS SNAKES EVERYWHERE, FROGS THAT IF I TOUCH, I'M GONNA KEEL OVER. BUT THIS CHALLENGE IS GONNA FORCE ME TO TAKE THE SURVIVAL SKILLS THAT I TEACH ON A REGULAR BASIS AND APPLY THEM TO A REAL-LIFE SITUATION. I'M NOT REALLY SELF-CONSCIOUS. I DON'T FEEL WEIRD AT ALL ABOUT BEING NAKED. Clint: THE NAKED THING'S FREAKIN' WEIRD. NIGHT ONE IS GONNA BE INTERESTING. I'M HAVING A SLEEPOVER. USUALLY, IT TAKES A COUPLE DATES TO GET TO THAT POINT. I DO WORRY THAT MY PARTNER WILL BE DISTRACTED BY BEING AROUND A NAKED FEMALE. WELL, HOPEFULLY I'M ATTRACTED TO THE PERSON I'M WITH. I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO STARE AT SOMEONE I'M NOT ATTRACTED TO FOR 21 DAYS. Laura: I'M BEING VERY OPTIMISTIC AND HOPING THAT HE'LL BE ENOUGH OF A PROFESSIONAL TO LOOK PAST THE NUDITY AND GET THE JOB DONE. HERE WE GO. BASICALLY, I'M LOOKING AT MY PARTNER AS ANOTHER SURVIVAL TOOL. I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE AN ARROGANT *BLEEP* WHO JUST THINKS HE'S GONNA BOSS ME AROUND 'CAUSE I'M THE LITTLE CAMP WOMAN WHO'S GONNA BE BACK TENDING THE FIRE. I CAN HOLD MY OWN, AND I HOPE THAT HE MAKES AS MANY CONTRIBUTIONS AS I PLAN ON MAKING. Clint: MY PARTNER NEEDS TO HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR. IF WE START BITCHING AT EACH OTHER AND THERE'S NO HUMOR THERE, IT'S GONNA BE A LONG 21 DAYS, AND WE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT. THAT WAS ROUGH GETTING IN HERE. HI. I'M CLINT. LAURA. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. WHERE YOU FROM? I AM FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. WHERE ARE YOU FROM? I'M FROM INDIANA. SWEET. YOU GOT SURVIVAL BACKGROUND OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? I HAVE A SURVIVAL BACKGROUND. DO YOU? YEAH. BE AWESOME. YEAH. WE PROBABLY NEED TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. THE TIDE'S COMING IN, SO... SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. LET'S GET UP AND MOVE ON. LET'S DO IT. COOL? ALL RIGHT. SWEET. Narrator: LAURA AND CLINT ARE EACH ALLOWED TO BRING ONE ESSENTIAL SURVIVAL ITEM. BAGS. THERE'S A HIS AND A HERS. OH, NICE. IT'S MY MACHETE, SO THIS IS MY SURVIVAL ITEM. AWESOME, AWESOME. I'M PRETTY PSYCHED. I'M SURE YOU CAN FIGURE OUT SOME OF THE USES FOR THIS. HERE'S MY ITEM. TRY NOT TO LAUGH. HEY, REEF. I SEE. OKAY. WE'RE GONNA USE THEM. Clint: I HATE THE OCEAN, BUT FISH ARE UNDERWATER. I NEED TO BE UNDERWATER, TOO. Narrator: A SMALL CREW WILL CAPTURE THE 21-DAY JOURNEY WITH INSTRUCTION NOT TO INTERVENE UNLESS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY MAKES IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. IN ADDITION, CLINT AND LAURA ARE PROVIDED WITH HANDHELD CAMERAS TO RECORD THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE FROM THEIR OWN POINT OF VIEW. ALL RIGHT. THAT IT? COOL. WE HAVE A MAP. WE CAME IN HERE IN THIS COVE, RIGHT? YEAH, THAT'S THE ONLY COVE I SEE ON THE MAP. AND THEN WE SEE THE "X," WHICH IS DEFINITELY IN THE WATER. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GETTING OUT. A PRIMITIVE MAP OF THE AREA HAS BEEN GIVEN TO CLINT AND LAURA, INDICATING THEIR EXTRACTION POINT OFFSHORE TO THE NORTHEAST. THEY'LL NEED TO BUILD A RAFT THAT WILL CARRY THEM PAST THE BREAKERS TO THE OPEN SEA, WHERE THEY'LL BE RESCUED. THE MAP ALSO SHOWS A BEACHHEAD SEVERAL MILES NORTHWEST OF THEIR CURRENT POSITION, FLANKED BY A CAIMAN-INFESTED SWAMP, WHICH THEY'LL CALL HOME FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS. STAYING IN THE JUNGLE PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF THE COVE IS DANGEROUS, SO THEY NEED TO TREK THROUGH THE IMPENETRABLE VEGETATION TO GET TO THE BEACH AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ALL RIGHT, SO, WE HAVE TO MOVE ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE TO THIS BEACH. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO PROBABLY THROUGH ALL THIS. YEAH. Clint: YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO BE SPENDING THE NIGHT IN THIS. IT'S A TERRIBLE AREA TO CAMP. ALSO, IT'S THE RAINY SEASON, SO I DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT OUT IN THE JUNGLE WHEN IT STARTS COMING DOWN. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. LET'S DO IT. [ SQUAWKS ] BE CAREFUL. THERE'S DEFINITELY SNAKES AROUND HERE. UGH. *BLEEP* THIS IS GONNA BE A SLIPPERY MESS AND SOME REAL FLATTERING ANGLES, TOO. I DON'T SEE ANY RED FLAGS WITH CLINT. I DON'T NEED NO STINKIN' MACHETE. BUT I'M IMAGINING MAYBE HE PICKED UP SURVIVAL AS A NEAT TRICK TO IMPRESS OTHER PEOPLE, AND I HOPE HE DOESN'T TRY TO IMPRESS ME WITH IT. CHECK THIS OUT. DUDE, EVERYTHING AROUND HERE IS CORDAGE. PRETTY DECENT. Clint: MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF LAURA -- SHE'S OBVIOUSLY A VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN, AND SHE REALLY HAS THAT GO-GET-'EM ATTITUDE. I HOPE SHE'S GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO DO THIS. Narrator: AS PART OF THEIR SELECTION PROCESS, CLINT AND LAURA HAVE UNDERGONE RIGOROUS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING. THEIR OVERALL SURVIVAL ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN EVALUATED BY EXPERTS ACCORDING TO THREE CATEGORIES... CLINT'S EXPERIENCE AS A SURVIVALIST TEACHER SCORES HIM HIGHLY, BUT HIS LACK OF REAL-WORLD EXPERIENCE COUNTS AGAINST HIM. LAURA HAS TESTED HER SURVIVAL SKILLS IN A VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTS. THIS IS A POINT, BUT HER LONER MENTALITY COULD PREVENT HER FROM WORKING AS A TEAM. CLINT AND LAURA ARE GIVEN AN OVERALL PRIMITIVE SURVIVAL RATING, OR PSR. CLINT'S PRIMITIVE SURVIVAL RATING IS SET AT 6.9. LAURA'S IS 7.9. OUR EXPERTS WILL REASSESS THEIR PRIMITIVE SURVIVAL RATING AT THE END OF THE 21-DAY CHALLENGE. I'M KIND OF SKETCHED OUT BY THESE FREAKIN' HOLES. I KNOW. I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT SNAKES, MAN. THAT'S ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. I HATE SNAKES. DO YOU WANT ME TO GO FIRST? 'CAUSE I REALLY DON'T GIVE A *BLEEP* ABOUT SNAKES. YEAH. CLINT AND LAURA NOW MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE JUNGLE IN SEARCH OF A SAFE PLACE TO PUT THEIR SHELTER, SOMEWHERE DRY AND AWAY FROM BUGS. OH *BLEEP* THAT SON OF A *BLEEP* STING. YEAH, THESE ANTS DEFINITELY -- THEY BITE. Clint: I'VE NEVER SEEN THESE IN PERSON BEFORE, BUT IT'S NOT TOO HARD TO TELL THESE ARE LEAF-CUTTER ANTS. I'VE BEEN GETTING BIT. NOW I SEE WHAT THE CULPRIT IS. WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR THOSE WHEN WE SET UP CAMP. WHOA! CHECK OUT THAT COOL SPIDER. YEAH, LET'S NOT. Laura: AS FAR AS SPIDERS GO, THERE'S ONE BIG SPIDER HERE CALLED THE ANTELOPE SPIDER THAT IS INCREDIBLY PAINFUL IF YOU GET BIT. THAT'S THE END. THAT'S GAME OVER. FEEL LIKE A NAKED LEWIS AND CLARK. OH *BLEEP* OH, MY GOODNESS. OH, NICE. I JUST FOUND, IN RIDICULOUS ABUNDANCE, WATER APPLE, WHICH IS AN EDIBLE FRUIT THAT I'VE READ ABOUT. THAT'S AWESOME. ALL THAT SUGAR AND THOSE NUTRIENTS, ALONG WITH THE ADDED HYDRATION -- THIS CAN BE REALLY GOOD FOR BOTH OF US. WOW. IT'S LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A KID'S BOOK OR SOMETHING. I KIND OF FEEL LIKE ADAM AND EVE. OH-HO. [ LAUGHS ] DEFINITELY FEELING THE SUN. OH, MY GOD. IS THERE A COCONUT? OH, MY GOD. I FOUND COCONUTS. I'M TAKING TWO COCONUTS. LET'S EACH GRAB ONE, AT LEAST. YOU GOT IT. YOU GOT IT. *BLEEP* OH, MY GOD. CRAP. BLOOD. OH, MY GOD. THIS IS, LIKE -- WOW. I HAVE A MACHETE WOUND, SO HERE'S THE FIRST WOUND OF THE TRIP. THAT'S REALLY BLEEDING. DEFINITELY DANGER OF INFECTION, DANGER OF FUNGUS. WE NEED TO GET IT TIED UP. Laura: I KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE JUNGLE TO KNOW IT'S NOT THE PLACE YOU WANT TO BE DEALING WITH A FESTERING WOUND. IT'S JUST WARM AND WET, AND BACTERIA REALLY LIKES THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT. SO IT DEFINITELY MAKES THIS MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD BE. [ SQUAWKS ] Clint: GOD, MAN, MY FOOT IS KILLING ME NOW. I KNOW. MINE IS, TOO. IT'S ON FIRE. I WOULDN'T BE SO SKETCHED OUT IF I HAD SHOES ON, YOU KNOW? OH, MY GOSH! LOOKIT! YEAH. FRESHWATER. THAT WAS A GOOD FIND. [ LAUGHS ] I FEEL LIKE IF WE JUST STUCK A FREAKIN' STICK IN THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN, WATER WOULD JUST COME OUT FILTERED. THAT'S AWESOME. THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME INHERENT RISK WITH DRINKING ANY WATER SOURCE THAT HASN'T BEEN PURIFIED, I.E. BOILING, IN A PRIMITIVE SITUATION. BUT SOMETIMES, YOU GOT TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO GET WATER WHEN YOU CAN IN THE SAFEST WAY YOU CAN, AND THIS IS IT FOR US RIGHT NOW. OH, MY GOSH. I SEE BEACH. YEAH. WE MADE IT. SMELL THE OCEAN. THIS IS LIKE HONEYMOON MATERIAL RIGHT HERE. THIS IS LIKE PARADISE. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH. WE GOT COCONUTS. Clint: [ LAUGHS ] Clint: I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT I WAS PAIRED UP WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS AN AWESOME SENSE OF HUMOR AND HAS SKILLS. LET'S SIT BY THE CREEK AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST UTILIZE THE REST OF THE DAY. I'M REALLY HAPPY WE GOT OUT OF THAT JUNGLE, BUT WE GOT A LOT TO DO AND NOT A LOT OF TIME TO DO IT. WE NEED TO REALLY START CRACKING DOWN ON SHELTER. I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO BE ANYWHERE IN THOSE WEEDS. I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT BATS AND SNAKES. WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE BATS? RABIES. [ CHUCKLES ] I DON'T WANT ANYTHING GETTING ME OUT OF HERE BEFORE 21 DAYS. Laura: CLINT'S GETTING REALLY FREAKED OUT OVER BATS AND SNAKES. I'M STARTING TO THINK HE'S NOT THE SURVIVALIST HE CLAIMS HE IS. HONESTLY, I WOULDN'T BE OPPOSED TO STAYING OUTSIDE THE GRASS LINE HERE. I FEEL LIKE THE TIDE REALLY COMES UP HERE. WOULD YOU RATHER SLEEP ON THE BEACH TILL THE TIDE COMES IN? I WOULDN'T BE COMFORTABLE SLEEPING THERE BECAUSE I WANT TO BE, LIKE, TO WHERE THE VEGETATION STARTS. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RUNNING IN WHEN THE TIDE COMES. YEAH. WELL, OKAY. ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST FIND THE SPOT, THEN. Clint: SO, WE GO WITH LAURA'S IDEA ABOUT WHERE TO SET UP THE SHELTER. THIS PISSES ME OFF BECAUSE IT TAKES US OFF THE BEACH AND PUTS US TOO CLOSE TO THE SWAMPS. HOLD ON, LET ME MOVE THIS UP A LITTLE BIT. YOU GO 10 FEET OFF THE BEACH, YOU'RE IN SWAMPY, CRAPPY JUNGLE. YOU GOT BATS DOWN HERE, CAIMAN, BIG-ASS PYTHONS. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS, WHEN I'M SLEEPING, STUFF CRAWLING ON ME. I THINK WE'RE GETTING REALLY CLOSE TO BEING OUT OF DAYLIGHT. YEAH. [ INSECTS CHIRPING, ANIMAL GROWLS ] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn SOMETHING'S OUT THERE. I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED ON THE BEACH. Clint: YOU'RE GETTING BIT, LIKE, JUST EVERYWHERE AT ONCE. Laura: LOOK AT HOW CRAZY SWOLLEN MY FEET ARE. I COULD GO INTO ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK AND BE DEAD. THAT COULD END EVERYTHING. *BLEEP* OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. RIGHT THERE. WAIT. CAN WE GO WITH THIS? *BLEEP* Clint: WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, AGAIN? 'CAUSE I THINK IT'S GONNA BE A GREAT TIME AND AN AWESOME CHALLENGE... YEAH. ...AND A SUPER EXCITING ADVENTURE. WHY ARE YOU DOING IT? [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: LAURA AND CLINT HIKED ALL DAY THROUGH THE HOT, REPTILE-INFESTED PANAMANIAN JUNGLE, NAVIGATING TREACHEROUS TERRAIN AND SURVIVING THE JOURNEY'S FIRST OPEN WOUND. I FEEL REALLY STUPID. THEY FINALLY MADE IT TO THE BEACHHEAD THEY'LL CALL HOME FOR THE NEXT 21 DAYS. AFTER FINDING A WATER SOURCE, THEY BUILT A PRIMITIVE SHELTER ON THE JUNGLE'S EDGE, DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE SWAMP. BY NIGHT, THEIR ISLAND PARADISE REVEALED ITS DARKER SIDE -- A HUMID HELLHOLE DOMINATED BY SWARMING INSECTS AND CRAWLING, SLITHERING CREATURES. SUNRISE, DAY 2. TERRIBLE NIGHT. Laura: THIS MORNING, MY LEGS WERE COMPLETELY COVERED IN RED DOTS. IT LOOKED LIKE SOME KIND OF DEADLY, CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. IT WAS AWFUL. Narrator: LAURA AND CLINT HAVE BEEN BESIEGED BY SAND FLIES, ALSO KNOWN AS CHITRAS. LESS THAN 1/8 OF AN INCH, THEY'RE THE SMALLEST OF ALL BITING AND STINGING INSECTS. IT IS THE WORST ITCHING I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED, AND IT'S ALL OVER MY BODY. Narrator: BITES FROM CHITRAS CAN TRANSMIT DISEASE, CAUSING FEVER, LIVER AND SPLEEN ENLARGEMENT, AND ANEMIA. Laura: WITHOUT FIRE, THE BUGS HERE ARE JUST GONNA MAKE SLEEP IMPOSSIBLE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO GET FIRE TODAY. THAT IS A PRIORITY SO WE WON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BUGS ANYMORE. I'M WITH HER. SO, THIS IS THE BAMBOO FIRE SAW. BASICALLY, YOU SPLIT THE BAMBOO, SCRAPE ALL OF YOUR BAMBOO SKIN, PUT THIS UP AGAINST YOUR BEER BELLY, AND I'M GONNA MAKE SLOW STROKES AND JUST KEEP GOING UNTIL I CAN'T GO ANYMORE OR THIS BREAKS. THAT'S THE REAL CHALLENGE HERE, OTHER THAN THE HUMIDITY. IT'S FREAKIN' HUMID. THANKS. Laura: CLINT STARTED WITH THE FIRE SAW, AND ORIGINALLY, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA, BUT THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, THE LESS I WANT TO BET ANOTHER NIGHT'S SLEEP ON IT. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] IT'S FREAKIN' BRUTAL. I'M SO EXHAUSTED. I WANT FIRE, SO I WANT TO GO WITH BOW DRILL. Narrator: THE BOW DRILL IS AN ANCIENT METHOD FOR STARTING FIRE. USING FRICTION, THE BOW DRILL CONSISTS OF FOUR PARTS -- THE BOW, CORDAGE FOR STRING, THE DRILL, AND THE FIREBOARD. I CAN'T HARDLY EVEN *BLEEP* MOVE AROUND BECAUSE I'M SO LOW ON WATER AND EVERYTHING ELSE. EVERYTHING IS ON US GETTING FIRE TODAY. IF YOU NEED MORE WATER, GO GET MORE WATER. Clint: WE NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST 10 TO 12 LITERS A DAY OUT HERE. ME -- I REQUIRE A LOT MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE. IF WE GET HEATSTROKE, WE GET DEHYDRATED, THAT'S IT. IT'S OVER. *BLEEP* IT'S ALMOST DARK, AND WE DON'T HAVE A FIRE. Clint: WE CAN'T GO ANOTHER NIGHT WITHOUT FIRE. COMPLETELY JUST COVERED IN HIVES AND BITES. Laura: LOOK AT HOW CRAZY SWOLLEN MY FEET ARE. I DON'T KNOW IF ALL THE BUGBITES ARE DOING SOMETHING WEIRD. I'VE NEVER SEEN MY FEET LIKE THIS. MY TOES LOOK LIKE LITTLE SAUSAGES, AND I CAN'T EVEN BEND THEM. THEY'RE JUST TOTALLY STIFF. *BLEEP* *BLEEP* BUGS. UGH. GETTING EATEN TO DEATH BY *BLEEP* BUGS, MAN. WE GOT RATS CRAWLING ALL OVER US, AND THE RATS BRING THE SNAKES. IT'S LIKE *BLEEP* TORTURE. Narrator: IT'S DAY 3, AND LAURA IS FEELING THE EFFECTS OF TWO DAYS OF BUG ATTACKS. Laura: DAY 3 WITH NO SLEEP, COMPLETED COVERED WITH BUGS, AND WE HAVEN'T EATEN. MY FEET ARE, LIKE, INSANELY PAINFUL. I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE MY LITTLE SAUSAGE FEET WILL TOLERATE THIS. Laura: HEY. HEY, SICKLING. HOW YOU FEELING? I FEEL LIKE *BLEEP* Clint: I FEEL REALLY BAD FOR LAURA. WE NEED FIRE TO KEEP THE BUGS AND THE ANIMALS AWAY, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE WEATHER'S MOVING IN. IF IT STARTS RAINING, IT'S GONNA BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A FIRE, AND EVEN MORE BUGS ARE GONNA START ATTACKING US. [ THUNDER CRASHES ] Narrator: IN A TROPICAL CLIMATE LIKE PANAMA, IT CAN RAIN FOR UP TO A WEEK AT A TIME. [ THUNDER CRASHES ] Laura: IT'S LIKE IT'S BEEN RAINING FOREVER. THERE'S NO MARK BETWEEN DAY AND NIGHT BECAUSE IT'S JUST WET AND DARK. IT'S BEEN ABSOLUTELY AWFUL FOR OUR SPIRITS. Narrator: WITH THE TEMPERATURE DROPPING AND A DECLINE IN LAURA AND CLINT'S CORE BODY HEAT, HYPOTHERMIA BECOMES A REAL POSSIBILITY. Laura: IT'S REALLY ENERGETICALLY TAXING TO BE COLD ALL THE TIME. I THINK MOST PEOPLE IN MY SITUATION WOULD BE COMFORTABLE USING BODY HEAT. LAYING NAKED NEXT TO SOME MAN WHO I ONLY MET A FEW DAYS AGO IS NOT A COMFORTABLE THOUGHT AT ALL. I'M JUST WAITING FOR THAT MORNING WE WAKE UP AND THERE IS BLUE SKY. Clint: MOTHER NATURE, YOU KNOW? SHE'S THE BOSS. SHE'S SAYING SHE DOESN'T WANT US TO HAVE FIRE YET, BUT WE NEED IT IF WE'RE EVER GONNA HAVE A DECENT MEAL. AND HOPEFULLY, THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRE WILL KEEP THESE DAMN BUGS AWAY. Narrator: DAY 8 AND THE RAIN FINALLY STOPS, BUT THE BUGS ARE STILL PLAGUING LAURA. Laura: IT, LIKE, SPREAD TO MY FACE. MY LYMPH NODES ARE ALL REALLY SWOLLEN RIGHT NOW. MY BODY IS REACTING REALLY STRONGLY TO SHEER NUMBER OF BITES I HAVE. Clint: LAURA IS JUST WELTED UP. I MEAN, THEY ARE JUST EATING HER ALIVE. IT'S LIKE THE JUNGLE IS SAYING, "GET THE *BLEEP* OUT." LIKE, THE JUNGLE'S TELLING US, "YOU AIN'T GOT TO GO HOME, BUT YOU CAN'T STAY HERE." Laura: MY BODY HAS DECIDED IT'S JUST TOO MUCH, AND I'M FINALLY HAVING A REACTION. I COULD GO INTO ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK AND BE DEAD WITHIN MINUTES. THERE WOULD BE NOTHING THAT CLINT COULD DO ABOUT IT. NOW I FEEL LIKE THESE VULTURES ARE CIRCLING ME, JUST WAITING FOR ME TO DIE. [ SQUAWKS ] Laura: GOD, PLEASE JUST THINK ABOUT FIRE. WE GOT TO GET THIS. I NEED THIS. Clint: I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR FIRE, BUT SHE'S FREAKING OBSESSED WITH THAT EGYPTIAN BOW-DRILL CRAP, AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO FAITH IN IT WHATSOEVER. I JUST WANT IT SO *BLEEP* BAD. IT'S LIKE I WANT IT TOO BAD. I'M GOING FOR A WALK. THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME. I MEAN, I'M AT THE POINT NOW WHERE I'VE ACCEPTED THAT MOTHER NATURE'S GONNA LET US HAVE A FIRE WHEN SHE WANTS US TO HAVE A FIRE. Laura: THIS IS IT. NO MORE *BLEEP* AROUND. Clint: ME TRYING TO DO BOW DRILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RAIN -- IT'S COMPLETELY POINTLESS. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE. OH *BLEEP* THAT SUCKS. SO, FIRE IS GONNA BE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF THIS WHOLE THING. SHE REALLY NEEDS THAT FIRE JUST TO HELP HER OUT AND GET THE MOSQUITOS OUT OF HERE. I'M JUST COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED. I'M GETTING OUT OF BREATH. I JUST CAN'T DO IT ALL MYSELF. I NEED HELP. CLINT! HEY! I REALLY NEED YOU DOWN HERE! *BLEEP* FREAKING OUT. I JUST PUT EVERYTHING I HAD INTO THAT. AND I NEED YOU TO HELP ME. I NEED YOU TO JUST STEP IN THERE AND USE THAT KIT. CAN YOU DO THAT? THAT'S FINE. IT'S LIKE MY BODY'S GOING AGAINST ME, AND, LIKE, I'M, LIKE, PHYSICALLY SHAKING. *BLEEP* I CAN'T DO THIS EGYPTIAN BOW-DRILL *BLEEP* WANT ME TO JUST GO FOR IT AGAIN? YOU'RE KIND OF CANTED FORWARD. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU... THING'S JUST SLIPPING. THAT'S THE PROBLEM -- I CAN'T PUT ANY PRESSURE ON IT. THE STRING STARTS SLIPPING TOO MUCH. I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THAT. IT'S OKAY. IT'S EITHER THE RIGHT WAY OR IT'S -- I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THAT. THAT'S NOT HOW I DO IT. UNREAL. TRY TO *BLEEP* TELL PEOPLE. I KNOW HE'S REALLY FRUSTRATED, BUT I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED, TOO, AND I JUST DON'T WANT TO FEEL ALONE IN THIS. Clint: I'M DEFINITELY ON A DOWNHILL FROM THIS POINT ON. I'M NOT GOING AFTER A *BLEEP* ALLIGATOR. THAT HITS YOU IN THE RIGHT ARTERY, YOU'RE DONE. WHOA *BLEEP* I'M FEELING REALLY FRUSTRATED. Narrator: LAURA AND CLINT ARE ON A 21-DAY SURVIVAL CHALLENGE OFF THE COAST OF PANAMA. BEFORE THEY EMBARKED ON THIS MISSION, THEY WERE ASSESSED BY SURVIVAL EXPERTS AND EACH GIVEN A PRIMITIVE SURVIVAL RATING, OR PSR. THEY WILL BE REASSESSED AFTER THE CHALLENGE ENDS. THE FIRST WEEK HAS BEEN A LOSING BATTLE WITH THE ISLAND'S SMALLEST PREDATORS, CHITRAS. Clint: THESE BUGS ARE MAKING ME JUST WANT TO GET THE HELL OFF THIS ISLAND. Narrator: FIVE STRAIGHT DAYS OF TORRENTIAL RAIN AND SUBSISTING ON COCONUTS, SNAILS, AND WATER APPLES HAS LEFT THEM COLD, EXHAUSTED, AND DEPLETED. CLINT AND LAURA'S SURVIVAL RESTS ON A KNIFE EDGE. THEY MUST GET FIRE. GO PAST WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING AND STOP. JUST GIVE IT EVERYTHING. *BLEEP* OH, YOU GOT THIS. MM-HMM. YOU'VE GOT IT. JUST KEEP IT TIGHT. DON'T BLOW THROUGH. YOU READY? YEAH. GO. WE *BLEEP* DID IT! *BLEEP* DUDE. JUNGLE FIRE. *BLEEP* YEAH. DAY 8, FIRE. OH, MY GOD. THAT'S THE BEST SMELL I'VE EVER SMELLED. Clint: I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THAT FREAKIN' THING WORKED. Laura: WOW. BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD. I'VE NEVER STRUGGLED SO MUCH WITH SOMETHING. AND I'M SO HAPPY CLINT CAME IN AND SAVED THE DAY. DAY 8, FIRE. SHE WAS TRYING SO, SO HARD, GETTING EXHAUSTED, AND IT WAS JUST A TECHNIQUE I WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH. AND I WAS STUBBORN, SET IN MY WAYS. BUT I'M VERY, VERY GRATEFUL. Clint: ALL I KNOW IS THIS FIRE FEELS AWESOME ON BUGBITES. Laura: I KNOW. Laura: NOW THAT WE HAVE FIRE, I CAN STEAM THE LEAVES OF THE NONI PLANT. IT'S A MEDICINAL PLANT FOUND IN THE JUNGLE. THE NONI LEAVES ARE WORKING. MY SWELLING IN MY FOOT'S GOING DOWN. IT'S PRETTY AWESOME. IT FEELS AMAZING. [ FIRE CRACKLING ] Narrator: GETTING FIRE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN KEEPING THE BUGS AWAY AND HELPING LAURA HEAL HER SWOLLEN FEET, BUT LACK OF FOOD IS MAKING CLINT AND LAURA INCREASINGLY CRANKY, STRAINING THEIR RELATIONSHIP. Clint: ALL RIGHT, IT'S DAY 11. ANTS ALL OVER THE FREAKIN' HUT. I GUESS LAURA LEFT A COCONUT IN THERE. I TELL HER TO QUIT LEAVING FOOD IN THERE ALL THE TIME, BUT SHE DOESN'T LISTEN. Narrator: REMNANTS OF FOOD ARE A SERIOUS THREAT TO LAURA AND CLINT'S CAMP BECAUSE THEY CAN ATTRACT A VARIETY OF DANGEROUS ANIMALS. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? Clint: BOTH OF US DON'T NEED TO BE HERE. SO I'M GONNA GO FIND FOOD OR DO SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW. I'M SO TIRED, ALL I WANT TO DO IS SLEEP. OH, MAN, I'M SO SICK OF OPENING THESE THINGS. PHYSICALLY, IT'S STARTED TO TAKE ITS TOLL ON US. I'M FEELING MORE OF THE EFFECTS OF LOW BLOOD SUGAR AND STUFF LIKE THAT THAN LAURA IS. I'D IMAGINE THIS IS WHAT MARRIAGE IS LIKE. Laura: ESSENTIALLY GONNA MAKE TWO BASKETS AND PUT THE SMALLER ONE INSIDE OF THE BIGGER ONE. Narrator: LOOKING TO THE SEA FOR THEIR PROTEIN, CLINT AND LAURA TRY TWO DIFFERENT TACTICS. LAURA WANTS TO TRAP FISH, WHILE CLINT FASHIONS A SPEAR AND A BAMBOO PLATFORM. BASICALLY, THE IDEA IS -- YOU SPLIT IT FOUR WAYS, TAKE IT, THEN YOU LASH THIS. THEN YOU WANT TO SHARPEN UP ALL OF THESE. IT'S PRETTY SELF-EXPLANATORY. Laura: WE'RE GONNA TRY TO TAKE THESE TODAY AND GO OUT AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOME LOBSTER OR CONCH OR SOMETHING OUT THERE. WE'RE STARVING. Clint: I HAVE ZERO EXPERIENCE ON THE OCEAN. LIKE ABSOLUTELY NONE. Laura: ENTERING THE OCEAN BRINGS A WHOLE NEW SLEW OF PROBLEMS. WE HAVE NURSE SHARKS, REEF SHARKS, BULL SHARKS, AND STINGRAYS OUT THERE. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. YOU GOT IT? YEAH. Clint: I'M GONNA BE GOING SLOW. I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN OFF THE COAST SWIMMING ANYWHERE IN THE OCEAN. I'M NOT A SWIMMER. I'M FREAKED OUT BY THE WATER AND EVERYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH THE OCEAN. AND THERE'S DEFINITELY SHARKS IN THE AREA. I'M OUT OF HERE. I'M BAILING, LAURA. FORGET THIS. ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? GIVE ME THE GOGGLES. LET ME FIND THE REEF. Laura: AS SOON AS CLINT STARTS TO DIVE UNDER THE WATER, HE TOTALLY FREAKS OUT. IT'S REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF. AND NOW, I HAVE TO SET THE LOBSTER TRAP AND DO EVERYTHING MYSELF. I'M ON A MISSION TO COME BACK WITH SOME FOOD. SO, I JUST SET MY LOBSTER TRAP ON THE CORAL HEAD. I HAVE IT BAITED WITH COCONUT. IT'S ON THE BOTTOM. I HAVE MY BUOY. TOO BAD MY PARTNER'S SUCH A *BLEEP* I COME UP OUT OF THE WATER, AND HE'S ALREADY ON THE BEACH. Clint: I'M HUNGRY, BUT NOT HUNGRY ENOUGH TO BE A SHARK'S NEXT MEAL. IF I HAVE A REASON TO GO IN THE WATER, I WILL, BUT AS FAR FROM A CALORIE POINT OF VIEW AND A TIME POINT OF VIEW, IT'S NOT PAYING OFF. SURVIVAL, TO ME, IS YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE CALORIES UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA GET THOSE CALORIES BACK. I'M NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF GOING AFTER BIG STUFF THAT CAN HURT ME. WHOA. *BLEEP* FREAKIN' BOA. NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN A BOA IN THE WILD. I'M NOT GETTING THAT CLOSE TO IT. I WISH LAURA WAS HERE. SHE'D PROBABLY PICK IT UP AND PET IT. WHOA *BLEEP* Laura: BETWEEN THE WATER BEING MURKY AND EVERYTHING BEING SO WELL-CAMOUFLAGED, IT'S DIFFICULT TO SPOT ANYTHING I CAN KILL. BUT I KNOW THERE ARE SEA URCHINS ON THE BOTTOM, AND THEY'RE EDIBLE. Narrator: SEA URCHINS IN PANAMA ARE USUALLY FOUND ON ITS CORAL REEFS. THEY HAVE RAZOR-SHARP VENOMOUS SPINES THAT CAN EASILY PIERCE THE SKIN, CAUSING MUSCLE SPASMS AND DIFFICULTY BREATHING. OH, HE'S TINY. DIVING UNDERWATER, USING ALL THIS ENERGY AND THEN I GET THIS URCHIN AND MY PARTNER IS GONE. CLINT'S GETTING REALLY DISCOURAGED, AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO MUCH. I WANT TO TRY TO KEEP HIM MOTIVATED AND TRY TO PULL HIM OUT OF THE PLACE HE'S AT AND NOT TAKE OUT HIS HUNGER ON ME. Clint: SORRY ABOUT LOSING MY COOL. I'M JUST FRUSTRATED. Laura: IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M JUST *BLEEP* EXHAUSTED. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT. WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT? I'M NOT TOUCHING THAT THING. IT'S A FREAKIN' SEA URCHIN. HERE WE GO, FIRST SEA URCHIN. LET'S GO EAT IT OUTSIDE SO WE CAN SEE IT. THAT STILL LOOKS RIDICULOUS. LIKE NOT EVEN FOOD. Clint: I WAS EXPECTING IT TO OPEN UP, BE JUST THIS NICE, WHITE, FLAKY MEAT, AND THAT WASN'T THE CASE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. Laura: THE URCHIN, TO ME, TASTED LIKE SUCCESS. I CAN ALREADY FEEL IT ENTERING MY SYSTEM. IT FEELS REALLY GOOD. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU EAT THAT. THAT IS SO GROSS. Clint: I'LL MAN UP AND EAT WHATEVER IF I FELT LIKE THERE WAS SOME SERIOUS NUTRITIONAL VALUE THERE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE URCHINS JUST AREN'T GONNA DO IT FOR ME. Laura: I THINK YOU REALLY CAN'T BE PICKY AT ALL IN A SURVIVAL SITUATION. ANYTHING WE CAN GET, WE JUST GOT TO EAT IT, WHETHER OR NOT IT'S THE MOST DELICIOUS THING YOU'VE EVER HAD. Clint: THAT'S NOT REALISTIC TO ME. REALISTIC IS EATING SNAILS AND EATING COCONUTS AND STUFF THAT I CAN FIND HERE. DIVING FOR LOBSTER? PBHT! YEAH, THAT PAID OFF REAL WELL. Narrator: DAY 13 AND STARVATION IS AFFECTING CLINT PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY. HE'S CONSUMED BARELY ANY PROTEIN FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS. LAURA IS GROWING INCREASINGLY WORRIED AS HER PARTNER HITS ROCK BOTTOM. I'M GETTING WINDED REALLY EASY AND I'M REALLY STARTING TO FEEL IT. Laura: IT'S BEEN KIND OF A STEADY DOWNHILL FOR CLINT. HE'S GOTTEN REALLY MOODY, REALLY HUNGRY, VERY LOW-ENERGY. Clint: I GET GRUMPY, BUT SHE'S BEEN KIND OF IN THIS, LIKE, MICROMANAGE MODE THE LAST LIKE THREE DAYS. IT DOESN'T REALLY SIT WELL WITH ME. Laura: SOMETIMES, I FEEL LIKE WHAT WE WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS EXPERIENCE IS SO DIFFERENT THAT IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL REALLY ALONE HERE. IT'S LIKE SHE THINKS IT'S "THE LAURA SHOW," AND IT'S NOT. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE JUST THINKS SHE'S GOD'S GIFT TO BUSHCRAFT OR SURVIVAL OR WHAT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK SHE FORGETS THAT I'M THE ONE DOING THE PHYSICAL, PHYSICAL STUFF AND HAVE BEEN SINCE WE GOT HERE AS FAR AS, LIKE, CHOPPING DOWN TREES. AND PRETTY MUCH ALL THE MACHETE WORK I'VE DONE. OKAY. OKAY, SO, WE NEED TO DO A REALISTIC ATTEMPT AT FOOD, SO... WELL, THERE'S FOOD JUST SITTING IN THE OCEAN. TRIED THAT OUT THERE. YEAH, AND WE BROUGHT BACK FOOD. NO, WE BROUGHT BACK SEA URCHINS, WHICH SUCK *BLEEP* I'M SORRY THAT YOU DON'T LIKE THEM. EITHER WAY, I'M NOT GOING OUT THERE TODAY. I'M NOT SWIMMING WITH ANY MORE SHARKS. I'VE BEEN CUTTING FIREWOOD. LIKE, THAT'S MY EXERTION FOR THE DAY. YEAH. WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO? HUH? WHAT'D YOU SAY YOU'VE BEEN UP TO? THAT'S A LOT OF *BLEEP* WORK TO CUT THAT FIREWOOD. AND THEN I GET *BLEEP* ABOUT IT, AND YOU ASK ME WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING THE WHOLE TIME, LIKE I'VE BEEN SLEEPING. YOU, LIKE, ASSUME THAT I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING. IT'S LIKE EVERY TIME -- NO, I JUST -- I WAS CURIOUS. IT'S JUST THAT IT'S GETTING REALLY OLD WITH THE *BLEEP* "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ALL DAY?" *BLEEP* YOU KNOW? DO I SAY THAT TO YOU OFTEN? YOU ASKED ME, "SO, WHAT DID YOU SAY YOU'VE BEEN UP TO?" WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HARD WORK. YOU KNOW, SO, THERE YOU GO. IT'S GETTING REALLY OLD WITH THE *BLEEP* "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ALL DAY?" I WAS CURIOUS. Narrator: CLINT AND LAURA'S 21-DAY PANAMANIAN CHALLENGE HAS BEEN ANYTHING BUT A DAY AT THE BEACH. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. Narrator: BECAUSE OF HIS FEAR OF THE SEA, CLINT'S FISHING ATTEMPT ENDED IN FAILURE. NOT WORTH IT. Narrator: AND HE WAS UNIMPRESSED WITH THE SEA URCHIN LAURA CAUGHT. LIKE NOT EVEN FOOD. LACK OF FOOD AND THE HARSH CONDITIONS HAVE CAUSED THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO HIT AN ALL-TIME LOW. CLINT IS STRUGGLING WITH THE SITUATION AND IS DISCOURAGED BY HIS SUBORDINATE ROLE WITH LAURA. IT BUILDS UP WITH ME, AND I TRY TO KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT AS LONG AS I CAN. AND, YOU KNOW, EVEN IF I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING, IT DOESN'T GIVE HER THE RIGHT TO TALK TO ME LIKE THAT. I ASKED HIM WHAT HE DID BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN HOURS, AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT THE STATUS WAS ON SOME STUFF. MAYBE HE GOT SOME FOOD. HE'S JUST VERY DEFENSIVE ABOUT THAT STUFF. I DON'T LIKE GETTING TALKED TO LIKE I'M 5 YEARS OLD. YEAH, IT GETS UPSETTING. SHE DOES WHATEVER THE HELL SHE WANTS, AND IF I DON'T GO WITH IT, YOU KNOW, I'M THE BAD GUY. SHE CAN COME HERE AND CUT THIS DAMN FIREWOOD. OOH. THANK YOU. YOU GET FIRST DIBS. IT IS WHAT IT IS. I WENT, TOOK HER A COCONUT. I FIGURE THAT'S AS GOOD AS JEWELRY. THAT WASN'T ME APOLOGIZING. THAT WAS ME DOING WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE TEAM. IT'S NOT REALLY SOMETHING I THINK WE NEED TO DIG BACK INTO TO RESOLVE. IT'S JUST TWO PEOPLE EXPRESSING THEIR OPINIONS. IT SHOULD ALL BE ALL RIGHT. Laura: I THINK WE KIND OF JUST BRUSHED IT UNDER THE CARPET. KIND OF SUCKS. I DON'T LIKE THINGS NOT BEING RESOLVED, BUT OUR CONFLICT DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY RESOLUTION. DAY 14. TWO-WEEK ANNIVERSARY. Clint: I'M TO THE POINT NOW WHERE UNLESS WE START REALLY EATING SOMETHING HUGE, I'M DEFINITELY ON A DOWNHILL FROM THIS POINT ON. Laura: WE CAN JUST GET ONE MEAL AND RIDE ON THAT FOR A LITTLE WHILE. YEAH, I CAN'T KEEP CHOPPING FIREWOOD UNLESS I'M EATING. THERE'S NO WAY. I AGREE. I'M CONCERNED THAT OUR PRODUCTIVITY IS DOWN BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EATING. WHEN I'M EXHAUSTED AND HUNGRY, I CAN'T BE EFFICIENT. IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE. Narrator: LAURA AND CLINT HAVE NOW GONE MORE THAN TWO WEEKS SUBSISTING ON WATER APPLES, COCONUTS, SNAILS, AND A SEA URCHIN. THEY ARE BOTH SHOWING DISTINCT SIGNS OF MALNOURISHMENT AS THEIR BODIES RAPIDLY DEPLETE ANY RESERVES THEY HAVE. THEIR STRENGTH IS LOW, AND PHYSICAL ENDURANCE IS POOR. LAURA AND CLINT ARE ALSO SUFFERING FROM THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF STARVATION, MAKING THEM ANXIOUS, IMPATIENT, AND WITHDRAWN. Clint: THE LAST TWO DAYS IS WHEN IT'S REALLY STARTED TO HIT ME AS FAR AS THE HUNGER STUFF. I FEEL LIKE I'VE LOST ABOUT 25 POUNDS. JUST LOOKING AT LAURA, WHO CAME IN NOWHERE NEAR AS BIG AS I DID, LIKE, I CAN TELL SHE'S DROPPING WEIGHT. YOU GOT A FLY ON YOUR HEAD. I FEEL IT. GET IT. I'M TOO TIRED. WE GOT TO EAT TODAY. IF WE DON'T EAT TODAY, LIKE -- YEAH, IT'S NOT AN OPTION. Laura: I THOUGHT MY REACTION FROM THE CHITRAS WAS BAD. NOW THE LACK OF FOOD IS REALLY TAKING ITS TOLL ON US BOTH. I MEAN, WE'RE LITERALLY CANNIBALIZING OURSELVES RIGHT NOW TO SURVIVE. YOU GOING OUT TO GET THAT LOBSTER THING? I'LL HEAD BACK AND CHOP SOME WOOD. I'M REALLY HOPING THERE'S SOME LOBSTER IN THAT TRAP. IT WOULD MAKE MY TRIP. WE'RE SO HUNGRY, AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS HAVE TO CATCH ANOTHER SEA URCHIN. OH, MY GOODNESS. MY WISHES WERE ANSWERED, AND I GOT A LOBSTER. OH, MY GOODNESS! THERE'S TWO! THAT'S AWESOME. I CANNOT WAIT TO SHOW CLINT AND LET HIM KNOW THAT THE OCEAN IS NOT A WASTE AND THERE'S TONS OF FOOD OUT HERE AND WE'RE GONNA EAT REALLY GOOD. WE GOT TWO LOBSTER! NO KIDDING? YEAH. FREAKIN' AWESOME, RIGHT? I SAW YOU WITH THE TRAP, AND I GOT A LITTLE EXCITED. OH, THAT'S SO AWESOME. TWO OF THEM FOR EATING. STOKE THE FIRE UP. LET'S GO. YES! OH, MY DAY JUST GOT BETTER. I KNOW! MY LIFE JUST GOT BETTER. WE'RE EATING LOBSTER. THIS IS THE MOST EXCITED I'VE BEEN. I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE IT. LIKE, IT FEELS WEIRD THAT WE'RE GONNA EAT. YEAH. AFTER WE EAT, YOU GO RESET THAT TRAP. [ BOTH LAUGH ] SUDDENLY, SOMEONE IS SUPPORTIVE OF MY TRAPPING. I THINK CLINT WAS FINALLY CONVINCED IN THE OCEAN'S VALUE AND THAT ME GOING OUT THERE WASN'T JUST A MASSIVE WASTE OF TIME. APPARENTLY, HE'S SOLD AS FAR AS OCEAN FISHING IS CONCERNED. I THINK WE SHOULD START POPPING LEGS OFF. MMM-HMM-HMM-HMM. Clint: I'M VERY PROUD OF LAURA. SHE HAD THE PERSISTENCE TO GO OUT THERE AND SET THE TRAP. I KNOW THAT WASN'T EASY. AND, YEAH, I'M VERY, VERY GRATEFUL. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY PROBABLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET FOOD HERE. THE ENERGY LITERALLY FLOWS BACK TO YOU LIKE A FEW MINUTES INTO IT. IT'S ALMOST LIKE SOMEONE JUST PUT A NEW BATTERY IN YOU. I'VE NEVER HAD A BETTER LOBSTER IN MY LIFE. Narrator: WITH THEIR ENERGY RENEWED FROM THE LOBSTER, CLINT AND LAURA FOCUS ON BUILDING A RAFT THAT WILL TAKE THEM TO THEIR EXTRACTION POINT. Laura: WE ONLY HAVE THREE DAYS LEFT, AND THEN THE NEXT DAY, WE HAVE TO LEAVE ON WHATEVER CRAZY RAFT WE BUILD. Clint: WE STARTED ON A PROTOTYPE, BUT SO FAR, I'M NOT SUPER CONFIDENT ABOUT THIS THING HOLDING US UP. OW! THAT'S MY HAND! Laura: I DON'T WANT THIS THING TO JUST BE GOOD ENOUGH. I WANT IT TO KICK ASS OUT THERE ON THOSE WAVES. Clint: THE EXTRACTION POINT IS 2 MILES OUT IN THE OPEN SEA. THAT WOULD BE A LONG WAY TO PADDLE IN ANY BOAT, BUT HAVING TO FIGHT WAVES AND THE CURRENT WITH NO ENERGY? IT JUST LOOKS LIKE DEATH, ESPECIALLY IN A HOMEMADE RAFT. Laura: DO YOU WANT TO HEAD BACK INTO THIS? WE CAN, YEAH. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, LAURA AND CLINT LEAVE THE PROTECTION OF THEIR SHELTER AND VENTURE INTO THE DANGEROUS SWAMP DIRECTLY BEHIND THEM. KNOWING THEY NEED ENERGY FOR THEIR FINAL PUSH TOWARDS EXTRACTION, THEY GO ON THE HUNT FOR FOOD. OH, MY GOD. CLINT! I DO NOT HAVE THE ENERGY TO WRESTLE A *BLEEP* I'M NOT GOING AFTER A *BLEEP* ALLIGATOR. IF YOU WANT TO DO IT, GO FOR IT. I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT MY PLAN OF ATTACK IS. CLINT HAS, AGAIN, CHICKENED OUT ON ME, AND I'VE NEVER HUNTED CAIMAN BEFORE. I DON'T WANT TO TRY AND GET IT BY MYSELF. Clint: BIG STUFF THAT CAN HURT ME. AS ROMANTIC AS IT SOUNDS TO GO UP AND WRESTLE A CAIMAN, THAT HITS YOU IN THE RIGHT ARTERY OR SOMETHING OUT HERE, YOU'RE DONE. [ ANIMAL CALLING ] Laura: OH, MY GOD. Clint: HOLY CRAP! Laura: THE CONSENSUS IS THAT 4 OF 5 DENTISTS RECOMMEND USING PALM-HEART FIBERS TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH, SO THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON NOW. Laura: HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT YOUR DENTAL HYGIENE AT THIS MOMENT? PRETTY GOOD. I GOT MY FLOSS... AND MY TOOTHBRUSH. DIPPED IT IN SALTWATER. IT'S GOOD. IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING. IT'S ALL ABOUT DENTAL HYGIENE OUT HERE, FOLKS. IT FEELS FANTASTIC. Clint: YEAH. WE GOT TWO LOBSTER! NO KIDDING? YEAH. Narrator: LAURA AND CLINT HAVE SURVIVED 19 DAYS OF THEIR PANAMANIAN CHALLENGE AGAINST THE ODDS. WITH TWO DAYS TO GO, LATE AT NIGHT, THEY HEAR CAIMAN APPROACHING THEIR CAMP. CAIMAN ARE VERY TERRITORIAL -- THE FEMALE, PROTECTING ITS YOUNG, PARTICULARLY AGGRESSIVE. HAVING KILLED THE YOUNG ONE, THEY RUSH BACK TO THEIR SHELTER IN TOTAL DARKNESS WHILE THE MOTHER IS STILL CLOSE BY. LET'S GO! LET'S GO! COME ON! WE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE SHELTER QUICK. THE FIRE AT THEIR CAMP WILL HOPEFULLY PROTECT THEM FROM THE FIERCE FEMALE. THE MACHETE'S AT THE END OF MY BED. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, IT'S DEAD. Clint: I JUST WANTED TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE AFTER WE GOT THAT, MAN. LAURA'S GUTTING OUR CAIMAN WITH A LITTLE PIECE OF GLASS BOTTLE WE FOUND. IT'S STILL MOVING. AAH! THIS IS HOW THE LAZY BOY COOKS HIS CAIMAN. SLOW ROASTING. AT FIRST, LAURA WANTED TO HUNT THE CAIMAN, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SCREW WITH IT, BUT KILLING THE CAIMAN -- I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. Clint: TASTE DONE TO YOU? YEAH. CLINT KILLED IT, SO WE GOT TO TRY CAIMAN FINALLY. CAIMAN IS DELICIOUS. Clint: AT THE START OF THIS CHALLENGE, WE WERE GIVEN A MAP, AND ON THAT MAP, THERE WAS AN "X." THAT'S OUR PICKUP POINT. THE THING IS, WE HAVE TO GET ALL THE WAY OUT HERE. EXCEPT OUR PICKUP POINT IS WAY OUT OFF THE COAST. SO THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO BUST OUT THE RAFT. I'M JUST READY TO GET OFF THIS *BLEEP* ISLAND. SO, DO WE WANT TO BUILD THE TOP, LASH IT, AND THEN LASH IT TO THE PONTOON? Narrator: CLINT AND LAURA'S FIRST RAFT FELL APART WHEN THEY TESTED IT. THEY NEED TO BUILD A BIGGER, STRONGER VERSION. Laura: NEITHER ONE OF US HAS EVER BUILT A SEAWORTHY BAMBOO RAFT. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT FLOATING. I'M WORRIED ABOUT FALLING APART. IF IT DECIDES TO STORM TOMORROW, IT'S GONNA MAKE A DIFFICULT TASK ALL THAT MUCH HARDER. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] 21st NOTCH -- VERY LONG-AWAITED. TIME TO GET OUT IN THE WATER. Narrator: GETTING THE RAFT THROUGH THE REEF TO THE EXTRACTION POINT IS A MAJOR OBSTACLE FOR CLINT AND LAURA. THEY HAVE TO NAVIGATE THE SHARP CORAL REEF AND GET THROUGH THE CHANNEL OUT BEYOND THE BREAKERS INTO THE OPEN WATER. THERE, THEY HOPE THE RESCUE BOAT WILL PICK THEM UP NEAR THE EXTRACTION POINT. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] Laura: I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED. THIS STORM IS HEADING RIGHT FOR US. WE GOT TO GET ON OUR RAFT AND GET OUT THERE RIGHT AWAY. ALL RIGHT. OOH, THAT DON'T FEEL GOOD. THE THING -- GO THROUGH THAT RAIN OVER THERE. Narrator: WHEN THE RAINSTORM HITS, THE VISIBILITY WILL REDUCE TO NEAR ZERO. THEIR RAFT, ALREADY A TINY TARGET, WILL ALL BUT DISAPPEAR, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SPOT FROM THE RESCUE BOAT. Clint: IF THAT STORM HITS US, WE'RE SCREWED. THIS RAFT WILL JUST CRUMBLE. THE RAIN LOOKED LIKE IT WAS COMING IN. THE WAVES ROCKING AND ROLLING A LITTLE MORE, PUSHING US WHERE WE DIDN'T WANT TO GO. IT WAS A RACE AGAINST TIME. WOULD HAVE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO TURN BACK. I MEAN, THIS IS DEFINITELY PROPORTION TO THE MAP. THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT THE SPOT. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE SOMEBODY. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING OUT THERE. DO YOU? NO, AND I'D SAY WE GOT ABOUT THREE MINUTES BEFORE IT DUMPS ON US. I THINK WE SHOULD TURN BACK. HEY! IT WAS HONESTLY ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING MOMENTS IN MY LIFE. I'M GONNA FLIP THE BOAT, I'M SO EXCITED. [ Laughing ] DON'T, DON'T. OH, MAN, WE'RE GLAD TO SEE YOU. Laura: I'VE NEVER BEEN THROUGH AN EXPERIENCE WHERE IT WAS TRYING THE ENTIRE TIME. WE ARE OFF THE ISLAND. ALL RIGHT. AWESOME. [ Laughing ] YEAH. YEAH. WE TOTALLY DID IT. OH! WE *BLEEP* ROCK. I WILL NEVER TAKE FOOD FOR GRANTED AGAIN. GOING FOR 21 DAYS WITHOUT BRINGING ANYTHING IN JUST MAKES ME MORE APPRECIATIVE OF THE THINGS IN LIFE THAT IT'S SO EASY TO TAKE FOR GRANTED. NO MORE CHITRAS. YEAH, NO MORE CHITRAS. Clint: THIS EXPERIENCE CHANGED MY LIFE. WE WERE EXPERIENCING, LIKE, THE DARKEST SIDE OF AN ISLAND PARADISE. LIKE, IT WAS HELL. WE'RE GOING HOME! OH, MAN. Narrator: AFTER 21 DAYS ON A TROPICAL ISLAND IN PANAMA, CLINT AND LAURA HAVE ENDURED MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HARDSHIPS THAT HAVE CHANGED THEM BOTH FOREVER. CLINT LOST A TOTAL OF 40 POUNDS, AND LAURA 17. CLINT IS NOW BACK IN INDIANA, TEACHING BUSHCRAFT AND SURVIVAL. LAURA IS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, GUIDING BACKCOUNTRY TRIPS. SURVIVAL EXPERTS REVIEWED CLINT AND LAURA ACCORDING TO THEIR SKILLS, EXPERIENCE, AND MENTAL APPROACH, REASSESSING THEM ACCORDING TO HOW THEY COPED WITH THE CHALLENGE. CLINT'S LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN JUNGLES AND THE SEA CAUSED HIM PROBLEMS HE COULDN'T RESOLVE, BUT HE MANAGED TO FACE DOWN HIS FEAR OF SNAKES AND REPTILES. LAURA STARTED WITH STRONG SURVIVAL SKILLS, WHICH SHE USED EFFECTIVELY TO KEEP THEM BOTH ALIVE. HER MENTAL TOUGHNESS GOT THEM BOTH THROUGH MORE THAN ONE CRISIS. HAVING WEATHERED STORMS, CHITRAS, CAIMAN, AND SNAKES, CLINT AND LAURA ACHIEVED A STEP-UP IN THEIR SURVIVAL RATINGS. CLINT'S PSR HAS INCREASED TO 7.3, WHILE LAURA'S IS 8.2. THIS EXPERIENCE PROVES THAT CLINT AND LAURA BOTH HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO SURVIVE NAKED AND AFRAID. Clint: NOW THAT I'M OFF THE ISLAND, I THINK I WOULD DO IT AGAIN IN A HEARTBEAT.
