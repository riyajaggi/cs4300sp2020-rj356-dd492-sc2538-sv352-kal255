 FED BY AN ANNUAL RAINFALL OF OVER 200 INCHES. [ THUNDER CRASHES ] [ ANIMAL CALLING ] COSTA RICA CONTAINS THE GREATEST DENSITY OF SPECIES IN THE WORLD. ITS GREAT BIODIVERSITY MEANS IT'S HOST TO A HUGE VARIETY OF POISONOUS INSECTS AND REPTILES. IT'S HOME TO MORE THAN 130 DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SNAKE, INCLUDING THE DEADLY FER-DE-LANCE, ONE OF THE MOST FEARED SNAKES IN THE WORLD. ON A SCOUTING MISSION JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE SHANE AND KIM ARRIVED, THE SHOW'S EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, STEVE RANKIN, WAS ATTACKED BY A FER-DE-LANCE. HE WAS BITTEN ON THE FOOT, WHERE THE VENOM QUICKLY SPREAD THROUGH HIS BODY. THE CREW SCRAMBLED TO TRANSPORT STEVE TO A MEDEVAC HELICOPTER, WHICH BROUGHT HIM TO A LOCAL COSTA RICAN HOSPITAL. JUST DRAINING SOME OF THE FLUID OUT. AFTER RECEIVING ANTIVENOM AND UNDERGOING SEVERAL SURGERIES, STEVE IS LUCKY TO BE ALIVE. BECAUSE OF THIS GRUESOME ATTACK, KIM AND SHANE WERE GIVEN THE CHOICE TO OPT OUT OF THE CHALLENGE. RELUCTANTLY, THEY AGREED TO PROCEED. Shane: MY FIRST REACTION TO OUR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER BEING BITTEN WAS, "HOW AM I GOING TO PREVENT THIS SIMILAR INCIDENT FROM HAPPENING?" THESE SNAKES ARE NASTY, AND THERE ARE MANY OF THEM. THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH 21 DAYS IS BY LOOKING OUT FOR EACH OTHER 24/7. MY NAME IS SHANE LEWIS. I GREW UP WITHOUT PARENTS, SPENT 13 YEARS IN FOSTER HOMES AND BOARDING SCHOOLS, AND IN ORDER TO TRY AND GET ME TO GROW UP, THOSE SCHOOLS DECIDED TO TAKE ME OUTSIDE. BEING OUTDOORS GAVE ME SORT OF A RELEASE, AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHEN I STARTED TO FALL IN LOVE WITH BEING AWAY FROM THE WORLD. Kim: WHEN I FOUND OUT THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER WAS BIT BY THE MOST POISONOUS SNAKE HERE, THAT MADE ME MORE NERVOUS. MY NAME'S KIM SHELTON. I'VE WORKED AT SUMMER CAMPS FOR A SURVIVAL SCHOOL. ANYBODY WHO PRACTICES SURVIVAL SKILLS IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO TEST THOSE SKILLS, AND THAT'S WHAT MADE ME WANT TO DO THIS. I'VE NEVER BEEN IN COSTA RICA. I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THE JUNGLE. AND I THINK IT'S GONNA EMPOWER ME AND GIVE ME A LOT MORE CONFIDENCE ABOUT THESE SKILLS THAT I'VE BEEN PRACTICING. Shane: I'M NOT A KID ANYMORE. I'M AN ADULT NOW, AND I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM BEING NAKED. BUT I AM DEFINITELY WORRIED ABOUT THE NUDITY LEVEL WITH THE PREDATORS THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE. EVERY SINGLE CUT'S A POTENTIAL SERIOUS INFECTION. WE'LL HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CREATIVE ABOUT PROTECTING OURSELVES. Kim: IN A TYPICAL SITUATION, PEOPLE WOULD BE OUT HERE IN THE JUNGLE WITH SHOES, PANTS, AND CLOTHING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THINGS LIKE THE SNAKES, BUT I'M NOT GONNA HAVE SHOES OR ANY CLOTHING, SO THAT MAKES ME EVEN MORE NERVOUS. Shane: I'M 40 YEARS OLD, AND I HAVE A REAL HARD TIME WITH THE 25-YEAR-OLD GENERATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE, AND I REALLY HOPE THAT MY TEAMMATE IS NOT THAT WAY. I WONDER WHAT THIS PERSON'S GONNA BE LIKE. I REALLY HOPE THAT THEY'RE NOT THE COCKY ASS *BLEEP* THAT I FEAR. OH. HELLO. HEY. NICE TO MEET YOU. PLEASURE. NICE TO MEET YOU. I'M SHANE. SHANE? I'M KIM. SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE BOTH NAKED AND JUST, LIKE, CHECK EACH OTHER OUT NOW? WE MIGHT AS WELL DO IT RIGHT NOW JUST TO GET IT OUT OF THE WAY. JUST TURN AROUND A COUPLE TIMES. NO PROBLEM. LET ME CHECK YOU OUT. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. GET IT ALL OUT IN THE OPEN. NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. NO, EXACTLY. DEFUSE THE SITU-- OH, THAT IS SO AWESOME. YOU DEFINITELY ROCK. THAT IS AWESOME. LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT SOME MANMADE PRODUCTS THERE, SO THAT'S PROBABLY FOR US. OH, COOL. Narrator: SHANE AND KIM ARE EACH ALLOWED TO BRING ONE ESSENTIAL SURVIVAL ITEM. YOU HAVE AN ITEM? I HAVE A FIRESTARTER. WITH EVERYTHING BEING DAMP AND MOIST AROUND HERE BECAUSE OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN, MAKING FIRE IS GONNA BE A STRUGGLE, EVEN WITH THIS THING. I HAVE A MACHETE. AWESOME. YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT? YEAH, I DO. YEAH. THIS IS DEFINITELY KEY. WITHOUT THAT, WE'RE IN BIG TROUBLE. Narrator: A SMALL CREW WILL CAPTURE THE 21-DAY JOURNEY WITH CLEAR INSTRUCTION NOT TO INTERVENE UNLESS THERE IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY. IN ADDITION, SHANE AND KIM ARE PROVIDED WITH HANDHELD CAMERAS TO DOCUMENT THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE. ALL RIGHT. LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A MAP. SHANE AND KIM WERE ALSO GIVEN A PRIMITIVE MAP OF THEIR LOCATION. IT SHOWS AN AREA OF STEEP VALLEYS COVERED IN RAINFOREST AND CRISSCROSSED BY RIVERS AND STREAMS. USING THE SUN TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS DENSE JUNGLE, THEY NEED TO PICK A SUITABLE PLACE TO CAMP NEAR A RIVERBED. THIS WILL GIVE THEM A SAFE PLACE FOR SHELTER, PROVIDE WATER, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR GETTING FOOD. AT THE END OF THEIR 21 DAYS, THEY FACE A GRUELING JOURNEY BATTLING THROUGH FORMIDABLE TERRAIN TO A WATERFALL SEVERAL MILES DOWNSTREAM. THIS WILL LEAD THEM TO THEIR EXTRACTION POINT. DO YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH ORIENTEERING AND STUFF LIKE THAT? YEAH, BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ABOVE ME. Shane: SO, PROBLEM IS, IS IN THIS JUNGLE, WE COULD BE 100 FEET AWAY FROM ANY KIND OF RIVER, AND IT WOULD BE THREE DAYS TO FIND IT. SO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY TO GET THAT SPOT THAT'S ON THAT MAP. AS PART OF THEIR SELECTION PROCESS, SHANE AND KIM HAVE UNDERGONE RIGOROUS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING. THEIR OVERALL SURVIVAL ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN EVALUATED BY EXPERTS ACCORDING TO THREE CATEGORIES -- SKILL, EXPERIENCE, MENTAL. SHANE'S EXPERIENCE AS AN OUTDOORSMAN SCORES WELL, BUT HIS INTOLERANCE TOWARDS YOUNGER PEOPLE COULD BE A MAJOR OBSTACLE. KIM HAS A STRONG MENTAL ATTITUDE. HER SURVIVAL SKILLS ARE GOOD BUT NOT PROVEN. SHANE AND KIM ARE GIVEN AN OVERALL PRIMITIVE SURVIVAL RATING, OR PSR. SHANE'S PRIMITIVE SURVIVAL RATING IS SET AT 7.6. KIM'S IS 5.8. OUR EXPERTS WILL REASSESS THEIR PSRs AT THE END OF THE 21-DAY CHALLENGE. WILL THEIR RATINGS IMPROVE OR DECLINE? YEAH, THIS WAY. [ SIGHS ] [ MONKEY CHATTERING ] Shane: THIS TERRAIN IS INTENSE. JUST THE DIVERSITY AND THE DENSITY OF THIS PLACE IS JUST AMAZING. I READ A STORY OF A GUY BEING LOST INSIDE THIS JUNGLE, AND HE MOVED THREE MILES OVER FIVE DAYS. Kim: WOW. Shane: I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP MY BEARINGS STRAIGHT. OOH! OH, MY GOD. OH, ANTS. OHH. YEAH. YOU GOOD? OH, MY GOD. YEAH, LET'S GO. GO, GO. UH, WE HAVE CUTTER ANTS. YAH! YOU *BLEEP* THAT HURT LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. THE THING WITH THE ANTS IS THAT IF YOU CROSS THEIR PATH -- THEY ARE BITERS. AND IT HURTS. I ALREADY GOT BIT BY THEM. THEY'RE VERY PAINFUL. AND THESE ARE THE SMALLER ONES. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH. SO, KIDDO, WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT OUTDOORS? EVERYTHING. TELL ME ABOUT MINNESOTA. IT'S COLD. [ SIGHS ] Shane: MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF MY TEAMMATE IS TYPICAL OF THE 25-YEAR-OLD GENERATION. SHE DON'T GIVE A *BLEEP* ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE. I'VE ASKED HER MULTIPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER. SHE HASN'T SPENT ONE SECOND OF IOTA TRYING TO LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT ME. IT'S FINE. IT'S 21 DAYS. I'LL JUST CONTINUE BEING HUMBLE. Shane: I AM CONSIDERED CRAZY WHERE I LIVE. REALLY? YEAH. MY PARENTS KICKED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE WHEN I WAS 6 YEARS OLD. WHAT?! I SPENT 13 YEARS IN 5 FOSTER HOMES AND 4 INSTITUTIONS. WOW. ARE YOU OKAY? I WAS AN ANGRY BASTARD IN MY 20s. SHANE TALKS A LOT. YEAH. HE'S ADMITTED TO HAVING ANGER ISSUES AS A YOUNGER MAN. I WONDER HOW THAT WILL PAN OUT IN THE FUTURE. [ CLICKS TONGUE ] WE HAVEN'T VEERED OFF THE DIRECTION TOO MUCH, SO WE'VE GOT TO BE GETTING CLOSE. KIDDO? YEAH? STEPPED RIGHT OVER HIM. WOW. Kim: IT'S JUST A BABY. BABY? THAT THING'S PROBABLY THREE FEET LONG. HIS COIL IS FOUR INCHES. WHAT DO YOU GOT, SIX COILS THERE? THAT'S A NASTY, NASTY SNAKE. Kim: WE SAW A FER-DE-LANCE. IF YOU GET BIT BY ONE OF THOSE, WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS DEATH. THAT'LL SOBER YOU UP QUICK. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW CLOSE I CAME TO STEPPING ON HIM. Shane: OUR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER WAS BITTEN BY A FER-DE-LANCE, AND THIS JUST BRINGS TO MIND HOW AWARE WE HAVE TO BE. THOSE SNAKES ARE NASTY. WE'VE GOT FOUR HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT. HEY, LISTEN. THAT RIVER? I'D SAY THAT WAY. YOU MEAN -- [ LAUGHS ] RIGHT DOWN THERE. WOW. THAT'S A WICKED DROP-OFF. Kim: LET'S GET TO IT 'CAUSE I'M THIRSTY. IF YOU SLIP, JUST GIVE ME A HEADS-UP THAT YOU'RE COMING DOWN ON TOP OF ME. [ BOTH LAUGH ] WHOO! ARE YOU OKAY? I GOT A SPIKE IN ME, BUT THAT'S -- I THINK. [ LAUGHS ] [ GRUNTS ] [ GROANS ] HOLY *BLEEP* WHEW! YOU OKAY? I'D BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT ONE. OH, MY GOSH. Shane: IF I HAD SNEAKERS ON, I'D BE RUNNING DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW. Kim: IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL! WOW. Shane: BEAUTIFUL, BUT I'M EXHAUSTED, AND WE STILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO DO. LET'S JUST GO UP HERE AROUND THIS BEND AND THEN ASSESS WHICH BEACH WE WANT TO BE AT. LEAD THE WAY, KIDDO. I'M GONNA HEAD OVER THAT WAY TO TRY TO GET SOME DRINKING WATER. DON'T CUP WATER WITH YOUR HANDS. YOUR HANDS HAVE BEEN ON EVERYTHING. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WATER THAT'S GOING OVER TREMENDOUS SURFACES. IF IT'S FOAMY LIKE THIS, IT'S OKAY BECAUSE THE BUBBLES ARE POPPING INSTANTLY. IF THIS FOAM IS STAYING, DON'T DRINK IT. Kim: MONKEY! AH! LOOK AT THE MONKEYS! [ LAUGHS ] I THINK THEY'RE SPIDER MONKEYS. [ MONKEY CHATTERING ] [ LAUGHS ] HE SEEMS PRETTY ANGRY. HE'S PROBABLY UPSET AT OUR PRESENCE HERE. Shane: I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEIR HOUSE IS. BUT MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T LIKE PEOPLE. I CAN RELATE. Kim: [ GRUNTS ] SHANE. LOOK. THIS IS PERFECT. DO YOU LIKE THIS SPOT? YEAH, WE'RE GOOD. IS THAT A BULLET ANT? YEAH, IT IS A BULLET ANT. THAT'S THE REASON WHY I WANT TO GET OFF THE GROUND. THERE'S GONNA BE THOUSANDS OF EVERYTHING MOVING AROUND HERE, SOME DANGEROUS PREDATORS, SOME NOT-DANGEROUS PREDATORS. SO WE WANT TO BE OFF THE GROUND TO TRY TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE STRESS OF THAT. LET'S FIND PIECES WITH Y's IN THE TOP. THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LASHING IT INSANELY TO KEEP IT ELEVATED. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? I AM VERY NERVOUS ABOUT THE PREDATORS THAT ARE IN THIS AREA. GOD WILLING, NOTHING DANGEROUS WILL COME IN AND TAG US WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO SLEEP. Kim: I WANT TO MAKE A FIRE. I HEAR YOU. IF WE GET THIS TODAY -- SUCCESSFUL DAY. [ BLOWING ] YAY! YAY, SHANE! YOU ROCK, KIDDO. YOU ROCK. Kim: HE KEEPS CALLING ME "KIDDO." HE SEEMS TO HAVE A PATERNAL THING GOING ON TOWARDS ME. BUT AT LEAST FOR NOW, I DON'T MIND IT BECAUSE I NEED SOME MORAL SUPPORT, AND HE NEEDS SOME MORAL SUPPORT, AND IT'S WORKING OUT. THIS IS, LIKE, AWESOME. IF WE DO GET COLD, THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE AWKWARD, US BOTH BEING NAKED, SPOONING. MAYBE I'LL BE THE BIG SPOON. [ LAUGHS ] [ THUNDER CRASHES ] THIS IS A LOT OF RAIN. AAH! [ GROANS ] SHANE ALMOST DIED. Shane: IT'S THE SAME SNAKE THAT BIT OUR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, AND I'M GONNA KILL HIM. THESE ARE THE DAYS THAT I'M GLAD I HAVE NO PARENTS, NO WIFE, AND NO KIDS. 'CAUSE IF I DIE, NOBODY GIVES A *BLEEP* ABOUT ME. WHY IS THE COSTA RICAN JUNGLE SO RAINY AND WET AND COLD? IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS WAY. Narrator: SHANE AND KIM HAVE TAKEN ON A 21-DAY SURVIVAL CHALLENGE IN THE COSTA RICAN RAINFOREST. USING A PRIMITIVE MAP AND THE SUN FOR NAVIGATION, THEY HAVE HIKED THROUGH DENSE JUNGLE TO A RIVER WHERE THEY'VE MADE CAMP. JUST 24 HOURS IN, THEY ARE BEING HAMMERED BY FIERCE, UNEXPECTED RAINSTORMS, WHICH CAN LAST FOR WEEKS IN THE COSTA RICAN JUNGLE. UNPROTECTED IN THEIR MAKESHIFT SHELTER, THEY ARE NOW AT RISK OF HYPOTHERMIA IF THEY CAN'T FIND FOOD TO CREATE MUCH-NEEDED ENERGY. I'M SO *BLEEP* COLD. THIS IS A LOT OF RAIN. CANOPY'S LEAKING. I GOT TO GO OUT THERE AND CUT SOME TREES TO PUT ON TOP OF THE CANOPY TO TRY TO CUT THE RAIN DOWN. Kim: EVEN WHEN IT'S PISSING RAIN ON US, I APPRECIATE HOW HARDWORKING SHANE IS, SO I TRY TO KEEP THE FIRE GOING SO THAT HE CAN WARM UP. BUT WE HAD TO MOVE IT UNDER THE SHELTER TO KEEP IT OUT OF THE RAIN. I WISH WE COULD HAVE IT BIGGER SO THAT IT WOULD GIVE OFF MORE HEAT, BUT FINDING DRY WOOD IS TOUGH HERE. AND I'M WEAVING BOTTOMS FOR MYSELF AND SHANE. Shane: WE'RE DEFINITELY LOSING A LOT OF BODY HEAT. Kim: IT'S GONNA TAKE US A WHILE BEFORE WE GET TO "SUR-THRIVAL" MODE. IF WE DON'T GET SOME SUNLIGHT, WE AIN'T NEVER GETTING THERE. IT'LL BE A BATTLE THE ENTIRE THREE WEEKS. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] IT'S REALLY HARD TO STAY WARM WHEN IT'S WET AND COLD AND YOU HAVE NO CLOTHES. I'M REALLY HUNGRY, AND I WANT TO GET SOME FOOD. Shane: THE CONDITIONS ARE SO PROBLEMATIC FOR HUNTING ANYTHING. IT'S WET AND MUDDY. ALL I'M TRYING TO DO IS SURVIVE. THIS WOULD MAKE THE THIRD NIGHT THAT IT'S JUST POURED ON US. I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET WARM. HOPING MY BODY WILL ACCLIMATIZE SOON SO I CAN STOP SHIVERING ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT. Kim: [ Voice breaking ] IT'S SO FRUSTRATING. I MEAN, I GET LITTLE TO NO SLEEP SO THAT I CAN KEEP THE FIRE GOING, AND IT GOES OUT. I NEED TO MAKE MY PARTNER FEEL COMFORTABLE BECAUSE SHE'S OVERWHELMED. AND IF I'VE GOT TO SUFFER, THEN I'VE GOT TO SUFFER. I JUST HOPE TO GOD THAT I DON'T GET SICK 'CAUSE I'M REALLY WORKING MY ASS OFF. [ GRUNTS ] WAY TO GO. IF THE SUN DOESN'T COME OUT AND START DRYING THINGS UP, WE'RE IN TROUBLE. [ GROANS ] AGREED. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN A CLEAR, BLUE SKY THIS WHOLE TIME. THE SUN IS OUT. ALL OF THE COLD-BLOODED THINGS ARE GOING TO NEED TO WARM UP, SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME OUT ON THE ROCKS AND BATHE IN THE SUN. AND WHEN THEY DO THAT, WE'LL BE THERE WITH A STICK AND A MACHETE. WE'RE BOTH HUNGRY. WE SHOULD GET FOOD. DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO, OKAY? YOU NEED THE MACHETE? NOPE. YOU CAN TAKE IT. WHAT ABOUT -- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I'M WORKING ON A ROOF AND THE SIDES. THERE'S ENOUGH SCRAP AROUND HERE, I CAN WORK ON IT. OKAY. WELL, I MEAN -- ALL RIGHT. SHANE AND I DEFINITELY HAVE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES. HE'S REALLY FOCUSED ON MAKING THE SHELTER WARMTH-TIGHT, AND I AM MORE FOCUSED ON TRYING TO FIND FOOD FOR US BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING SINCE WE GOT HERE. [ BIRDS CALLING ] THOSE BIRD ALARMS ARE ALARMING AT US. AND EVERYTHING LISTENS TO THOSE BIRD ALARMS, AND IT KIND OF MAKES ME FEEL HOPELESS 'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA SEE ANYTHING THAT I HOPE TO HUNT IF THEY KNOW I'M COMING BEFORE I EVEN AM CLOSE. Shane: I'M JUST GONNA SHORE UP THAT LEAN-TO AND FREAKING SLEEP ALL DAY, MAN, 'CAUSE I JUST CAN'T DO ANYTHING OUT HERE. I CAN'T REALLY HUNT. I CAN'T TRACK ANYTHING. [ SIGHS ] THERE'S JUST MUD. IT'S JUST MUD EVERYWHERE. [ MONKEY HOOTING ] HOWLER MONKEYS. I'M NOT GONNA GO NEAR HIS TREE, PISS HIM OFF, HAVE HIM COME DOWN. HE'D KILL ME FASTER THAN I COULD DEFEND MYSELF. THIS IS THEIR ENVIRONMENT, NOT MINE, AND THEY ARE A LOT STRONGER AND MEANER THAN WE ARE. [ HOOTING CONTINUES ] Kim: I'M TRYING TO CATCH SOMETHING TO EAT. BACK HOME, I HUNT, AND I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS. BUT IF WE DON'T GET FOOD IN US, WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO, LIKE, SURVIVE. I CAN'T CATCH ANYTHING. SOME MEAT WOULD BE NICE. PREPARING FOR THIS, I THOUGHT OF HOW MUCH FOOD THERE IS OUT HERE. I WAS EXPECTING TO BE HEALTHIER THAN I AM RIGHT NOW. Shane: I'M JUST SO COLD. MY BODY'S JUST SPENDING THE WHOLE DAY TRYING TO WARM UP. Kim: HOW YOU DOING, SHANE? TRYING TO GET WARM. SO EXHAUSTED. Kim: I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH SHANE. HE HASN'T REALLY DONE ANYTHING ALL DAY. I THINK HIS MORALE IS JUST REALLY DOWN. I FEEL LIKE NOT EATING IS AFFECTING HOW HE'S FEELING. [ MONKEYS HOOTING ] THAT HOWLER MONKEY IS VERY UPSET THAT WE'RE HERE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW STRONG THEY ARE? THEY'RE NOT VERY BIG. THEY'RE, LIKE, SMALLER THAN A RACCOON. THOSE THINGS ARE A LOT STRONGER THAN YOU THINK. I HOPE ONE OF THOSE FALLS IN THE RIVER. I'D LEAP IN AFTER IT AND HAVE IT FOR FOOD. YOU KILL ONE, WHO KNOWS WHAT THE FAMILY'S GONNA DO TO YOU? NO WAY WE'D BE ABLE TO FIGHT OFF FIVE OR SIX OF THEM IF THEY GOT THAT MAD. I'M CONCERNED THAT SHANE IS COLD, AND IT'S JUST REALLY SCREWING WITH HIS MENTAL STATE. WELL, KIDDO, NOW THE HARD PART BEGINS. HUNGER SETS IN. IT MAKES US CRANKY. CRANKY BITCHES. WELL, LET'S REALLY FOCUS ON BEING KIND TO ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT, IT'S JUST GONNA MAKE EVERYTHING HARDER. WE'RE A TEAM. WE CAN DO THIS. Shane: TODAY, I WOKE UP, AND I'M STARVING, SO I'M GOING TO TRY AND FIND FOOD DEEPER INTO THE JUNGLE. IT IS "SURVIVAL," RIGHT? NOT "DIE"? THERE'S SO MUCH WILDLIFE AROUND HERE. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING TO EAT. IT'S A GRUB. HOPEFULLY, THERE'S MORE. THERE'S AN ARMADILLO HOLE HERE. IN ORDER TO FIND OUT IF THIS IS A LIVING HOLE OR NOT, WE SHOULD PUT A LEAF OVER IT AND COME BACK IN TWO DAYS AND SEE IF HE'S MOVED THE LEAF OR NOT. BUT IT'S LIKE ANYTHING ELSE. THE JUNGLE DOESN'T GIVE IT TO YOU. YOU HAVE TO EARN EVERYTHING. [ MONKEY HOOTS ] [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] YOU SEE THAT? THERE'S A FOUR-FOOT SNAKE RIGHT THERE. IT'S THE SAME SNAKE THAT BIT OUR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, STEVE, AND I'M GONNA KILL HIM. YOU SEE HOW BIG HE IS? I'D APPRECIATE IF YOU WOULD BACK UP, OKAY? 'CAUSE IF I DON'T GET HIM, HE'S GONNA BE COMING AFTER SOMEBODY. I'VE GOT ONE CHANCE TO GET HIM BEFORE HE GETS ME. Shane: I HAVE TO GO FURTHER INTO THIS JUNGLE EVERY DAY TO TRY AND FIND FOOD, WHICH SCARES THE *BLEEP* OUT OF ME. Narrator: SURVIVAL EXPERTS KIM AND SHANE HAVE GONE OVER A WEEK WITHOUT ANY FOOD ON THEIR 21-DAY COSTA RICAN SURVIVAL CHALLENGE. BEFORE THEY EMBARKED ON THIS MISSION, THEY WERE ASSESSED BY SURVIVAL EXPERTS AND EACH GIVEN A PRIMITIVE SURVIVAL RATING, OR PSR. THEY WILL BE REASSESSED AFTER THE CHALLENGE ENDS. WITH MALNUTRITION NOW SETTING IN, TEMPERS ARE SHORT, ENERGY LEVELS ARE LOW, WHICH COULD AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO SURVIVE. ALONE ON A HUNT, SHANE HAS ENCOUNTERED A FER-DE-LANCE, ONE OF THE MOST DEADLY SNAKES ON THE PLANET. Shane: THAT'S A BIG *BLEEP* SNAKE. Narrator: THE FER-DE-LANCE IS EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE AND ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN 70% OF SNAKE ATTACKS IN COSTA RICA. Shane: IT'S THE SAME SNAKE THAT BIT OUR EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, STEVE, AND I'M GONNA KILL HIM. Narrator: THE EXCRUCIATING PAIN CAN RENDER THEIR VICTIM UNCONSCIOUS. THE HEMOTOXIC VENOM CAUSES SEVERE INTERNAL BLEEDING AND ROTS FLESH. WITHOUT IMMEDIATE TREATMENT, DEATH CAN FOLLOW WITHIN 72 HOURS. Shane: I'VE GOT ONE CHANCE TO GET HIM BEFORE HE GETS ME. IF I CAN PIN HIS BODY, I'VE GOT A FIGHTING CHANCE. I'D APPRECIATE IF YOU WOULD BACK UP, OKAY? 'CAUSE IF I DON'T GET HIM, HE'S GONNA BE COMING AFTER SOMEBODY. IT'S ALL ABOUT SPEED AND HOW BIG YOUR BALLS ARE. LOOK HOW NASTY HE IS. DIE, *BLEEP* [ GRUNTING ] *BLEEP* HIS POISON IS EVERYWHERE. HE IS PISSED. I'VE GOT HIS HEAD PINNED PRETTY DAMN GOOD, THOUGH. [ GRUNTS ] [ BREATHING SLOWLY ] HE'S NOT BITING ANYONE NOW. TELL STEVE I SAID HI. [ THUNDER CRASHES ] AW, COME ON! YOU GOT A SNAKE! FER-DE-LANCE. WOW! Shane: MY HEART IS STILL *BLEEP* RACING. ARE YOU *BLEEP* KIDDING ME? HE'S GOT TO BE FIVE FEET LONG. NOT VERY BIG. SOUNDS ALL WELL AND GOOD FOR YOU TO SAY, BUT THAT'S A NASTY *BLEEP* ANIMAL TO BE PLAYING WITH OUT THERE. WHEN I GET BETTER AT KILLING SNAKES, I MIGHT GO AFTER A PIT VIPER. Shane: I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO TRY TO KEEP THE GIRL HAPPY, AND THE FIRST THING SHE SAYS WHEN I GET BACK IS THE SNAKE IS TOO SMALL? [ THUNDER CRASHES ] I KILLED IT. YOU CAN SKIN IT AND COOK IT. Kim: I'M GONNA GO DOWN BY THE RIVER TO SKIN IT. THE HEART IS STILL PUMPING AWAY. THOSE ARE THE TASTIEST PARTS. I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING SOME PROTEIN IN ME. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT SOME OF THIS IS, BUT I'M GONNA EAT IT. I'M VERY THANKFUL TO GET THE SNAKE. THE JUNGLE IS FEEDING US. EVEN A DOG GETS LUCKY ONCE IN A WHILE. WE DEFINITELY NEEDED A MEAL TONIGHT. THOSE THINGS ARE MOSTLY BONE. Kim: I DID EAT THE HEART AND WHAT I THINK WAS MAYBE THE LIVER OR THE LUNGS, AND IT TASTED DELICIOUS. IT TASTED LIKE HOT DOG. Shane: I'M TRYING TO HUNT. I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO TRY TO KEEP THE GIRL HAPPY, AND SHE'S JUST VERY DIFFICULT, AND I JUST NEED SOME TIME AWAY. Kim: IT'S DEFINITELY BEEN A FEW HOURS SINCE I'VE SEEN SHANE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WENT, BUT I THINK HE MAY HAVE JUST WANTED REALLY ALONE TIME. LAST NIGHT, HE JUST KIND OF WENT OFF ON A RANT ABOUT HOW WOMEN ARE REALLY WEAK, AND I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT MAYBE HE THINKS I'M NOT CONTRIBUTING AS MUCH BECAUSE I SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON THE FIRE. BUT MAKING THE FIRE TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY, BUT IT'S JUST NOT VERY OBVIOUS TO HIM, I DON'T THINK. Shane: THERE'S A PIG UP THERE. I WATCHED HIM RUN UP THE SIDE. SO I'M GONNA GO UP, AND MAYBE I CAN COME DOWN AROUND AND COME IN FLANK WHEN HE GOES BY ME. YEAH, WHY AM I DOING THIS? JUST WASTE OF *BLEEP* ENERGY. BUT I'LL TRY. ANY LUCK, I'LL SLIP AND FALL AND TEAR MY *BLEEP* BODY APART SO I CAN GO HOME. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. YEP. AAH! [ GRUNTING ] [ COUGHING ] OH, MY GOD. THAT IS ONE *BLEEP* DROP. OH, MY GOD. THAT *BLEEP* HURTS. THERE WAS NOTHING TO HOLD ON TO. I TRIED TO GRAB ROOTS, AND THEY JUST BROKE. OW. [ COUGHS ] OH, MY GOD. MOVING THROUGH THIS JUNGLE IS IMPOSSIBLE. I DIDN'T EVEN MAKE 100 YARDS, AND I ALMOST DIED. Kim: YOU EXHAUSTED? I WAS TRYING TO COME UP BEHIND A PIG, AND I SLID OFF THE SLOPE. YOU SAW A PECCARY? KIM, THEY MOVE FASTER THAN YOU AND I COULD EVER IMAGINE. HOW BIG WAS IT? OH, THAT'S TINY. IF I DIDN'T CATCH THAT ROOT, YOU'D BE FINDING ME IN THERE *BLEEP* SOMEWHERE DEAD. REALLY? LITERALLY. HOW FAR WAS THE DROP? ABOUT 120 FEET TO A ROCK BOTTOM. IT WASN'T ABOVE THE RIVER? YEAH. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THE RIVER WAS MY BOTTOM. OKAY. YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO -- I'M JUST TRYING TO VISUALIZE IT. IF YOU WERE ABOVE THE RIVER -- FORGET IT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. Shane: THAT'S JUST *BLEEP* BEAUTIFUL. SHE THINKS I'M LYING WHEN I SLID OFF THE *BLEEP* NEXT TIME, PUT ME WITH AN ADULT, WILL YOU? I FEEL LIKE I'M BACK HOME WITH MY PARENTS. EVERYTHING I SAY, I'M JUST FULL OF *BLEEP* SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE SUPPORTING ME. AND SHE'S LIKE, "WHAT? REALLY? NO." SHE'S A 22-YEAR-OLD PERSON WHO DOESN'T GIVE A *BLEEP* ABOUT ANYTHING UNLESS IT REVOLVES AROUND HER. Kim: WHAT I'M LEARNING ABOUT SHANE -- WHEN HE'S FRUSTRATED OR SCARED OR ANY NEGATIVE EMOTION, HE'S GOT TO VENT IT WITH A LOT OF PHYSICAL EXERTION, WHICH MAY NOT BE THE BEST TIME FOR IT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF FOOD. BUT I'M TRAINED IN A LOT OF COMMUNICATION AND PEACEMAKING TACTICS. I KIND OF COMPARTMENTALIZE THE BATTLES THAT I WANT TO CHOOSE WITH SHANE. Shane: I'M JUST COLLECTING MORE WOOD BECAUSE KIM BURNS MORE WOOD THAN I WOULD APPRECIATE. AND I HAVE ASKED HER TO BE MORE CONSERVATIVE, BUT SHE JUST BURNS WHATEVER SHE WANTS. IS SHE GOING TO GET THE WOOD? NO. I DON'T GIVE A *BLEEP* I'M EXHAUSTED. Kim: WE'VE BEEN OUT HERE FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS, AND I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH SHANE. AND I THINK HE'S JUST REALLY EXHAUSTED, SO I LEFT HIM SLEEPING IN THE SHELTER. HOLY *BLEEP* HOLY *BLEEP* SHANE! SHANE! WHERE ARE YOU? SHANE! SHANE! [ COUGHING ] SHANE! GET OUT OF THE SHELTER! SHANE, WHERE ARE YOU? GET OUT OF THE SHELTER, SHANE! Kim: SHANE! SHANE! [ COUGHING ] Narrator: NIGHT 14. COSTA RICA. KIM HAS LEFT THE SHELTER AND THEIR FIRE UNATTENDED WHILE SHANE SLEEPS ON. UPON HER RETURN, KIM IS CONFRONTED BY A WALL OF FLAMES. Kim: [ COUGHING ] SHANE! SHANE! SHANE, WHERE ARE YOU?! GET OUT OF THE SHELTER! SHANE! Shane: AAH! AAH! [ COUGHING ] Kim: KEEP MOVING. Shane: [ COUGHING ] Kim: YOU OKAY? Shane: I ALMOST DIED. KISS MY *BLEEP* ASS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CREATE A FIRE UNDER YOUR PLATFORM. EVENTUALLY, IT'LL JUST GO UP LIKE A MATCH LIKE OURS JUST DID. AND SHANE WAS IN IT. SO, THIS IS WHAT'S LEFT OF OUR HOME AFTER IT BURNED DOWN. THE ENTIRE CANOPY COLLAPSED WHERE I WAS LAYING AND JUST LIT UP LIKE FIRE. Kim: SHANE ALMOST DIED. IT'S JUST A VERY INCREDIBLY SCARY MOMENT TO BE WOKEN UP SO ABRUPTLY LIKE THAT KNOWING THAT I ALMOST DIED. HE WAS LITERALLY SECONDS AWAY FROM GETTING SEVERE BURNS ALL OVER HIS BODY. Shane: THESE ARE THE DAYS THAT I'M GLAD I HAVE NO PARENTS, NO FAMILY, NO WIFE, AND NO KIDS. 'CAUSE IF I DIE, NOBODY GIVES A *BLEEP* ABOUT ME. [ COUGHING ] Kim: I'M KIND OF MENTALLY STRUGGLING. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE. Shane: I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS TO BE OVER. THIS IS ONE *BLEEP* NASTY, NASTY PLACE. IT IS RELENTLESS, AND IT JUST TAKES EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT. Kim: IT FEELS KIND OF LIKE WE'VE USED UP ALL OUR WELCOME HERE IN THE JUNGLE, AND THIS FIRE WAS SORT OF LIKE, "YEAH, IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE." I THINK WE SHOULD BOTH GO SIT IN THE SUNSHINE. IT'LL MAKE US FEEL SO GOOD. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. I'M JUST GONNA GO DOWN AND SIT ON A SUNNY ROCK. Kim: I'M JUST FEELING LIKE I'M JUST DONE HERE. BUT WHENEVER I GET THAT FEELING, I THINK OF MY MOM. SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, "IF YOU START SOMETHING, DON'T QUIT." AND I AIN'T GONNA QUIT. I SAW A TURTLE ON THIS BIG LOG OVER THERE. SO I'M GONNA SLIP IN THE WATER AND TRY TO SNEAK UP ON IT. YEAH! I GOT A *BLEEP* TURTLE! I GOT ONE! THIS MORNING, WE LITERALLY HAD NO HOME. AFTER CATCHING THIS TURTLE, I FEEL REALLY GOOD. THIS TURTLE REALLY IS, LIKE, THE ICING ON THE CAKE. YOU GOT TO GET THAT SHELL OFF. Shane: THE TURTLE IS AWESOME. THAT'S TWO DAYS OF GOOD FOOD. I'M STILL PISSED OFF OVER THE SHELTER BURNING DOWN, BUT I AM THANKFUL FOR HER GETTING US FOOD. NICE CATCH, KIM. THERE'S A LOT OF FOOD IN THIS THING. Kim: CATCHING THIS TURTLE MEANS SUCCESS. IT GIVES ME HOPE THAT MAYBE WE ACTUALLY CAN SURVIVE OUT HERE. Shane: I'M GETTING SOME ENERGY. FEELING A LITTLE BIT STRONGER. MY BODY IS REALIZING IT JUST ATE MEAT. WOULD YOU RATHER STILL HAVE OUR PREVIOUS SHELTER OR HAVE THE TURTLE? I WOULD RATHER BE EATING WHAT I'M EATING NOW AND GONE THROUGH WHAT I WENT THROUGH LAST NIGHT. Kim: FOOD JUST MAKES EVERYTHING FEEL BETTER. OH, THIS MAKES ME FEEL SO GOOD. ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE FORGIVEN FOR BURNING ME OUT LAST NIGHT. NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. [ LAUGHS ] OHH! I'M HAVING HOT FLASHES RIGHT NOW. I DON'T FEEL VERY GOOD. I SUGGEST YOU DRINK WATER. MAYBE THAT'LL HELP. Kim: YESTERDAY, I ATE PART OF THE TURTLE, AND MY STOMACH HAS BEEN GURGLING ALL NIGHT. KIM IS VERY SICK, VOMITING AND THROWING UP PROFUSELY. I CERTAINLY CAN SEE HER BODY BREAKING DOWN. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT. Kim: I'VE NEVER HAD FOOD POISONING. THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO FOR FOOD POISONING. I'VE HAD FOOD POISONING SIX OR SEVEN TIMES. THE FIRST TIME I HAD IT, I HAD IT FOR FOUR DAYS, AND THAT WAS OFF OF CRAB. [ GROANS ] I DON'T THINK I CAN *BLEEP* OR THROW UP ANYMORE. I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYTHING LEFT. THAT'S THE WORST PART ABOUT FOOD POISONING. WHAT? YOUR BODY IS GETTING RID OF EVERYTHING IT ATE, SO THERE'S NOTHING IN IT. MY STOMACH CRAMPS ARE JUST REALLY, REALLY PAINFUL. I'M JUST REALLY, REALLY WEAK, FEELING REALLY DOWN BECAUSE I KNOW I CAN'T DO ANYTHING. YOU GOT SOME ENERGY TO STACK STUFF, OR NO? NOT RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT, IF THAT'S OKAY. I'M SORRY. YEAH. MY STOMACH STILL REALLY HURTS. I'M SURE IT DOES. I AM STARTING TO GET CONCERNED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF BOTH OF US. IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO COLLECT FIREWOOD AND TEND THE FIRE AND WORK ON THE LODGING EVERY DAY AND THINGS LIKE THAT ALL BY MYSELF. I'M RUNNING DOWN WITH ENERGY, AND I CAN'T SUPPORT TWO PEOPLE. I JUST CAN'T DO IT. Kim: [ SIGHS ] I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER THIS MORNING. Shane: STARTING TO GET A LITTLE ENERGY. WELL, A LOT MORE THAN I HAVE IN THE PAST COUPLE DAYS. Kim: I THINK I'M BETTER NOW, JUST WITH HYDRATING MYSELF AND PURGING MY BODY OF WHATEVER WAS IN THERE. THANKS. Shane: SHE SEEMS TO BE DOING MUCH BETTER. AND I'M VERY HAPPY. I CERTAINLY CANNOT DO A DEAD MAN AND CARRY HER OUT WITH THE ENERGY DEPLETION THAT I'M EXERTING EVERY DAY. Kim: I KNOW THAT SHANE HAS BEEN REALLY PUSHING HIS BODY, AND HE'S REALLY PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTED. I GOT TO TAKE A BREAK FOR A COUPLE MINUTES. I CAN'T GET NO MORE WOOD. DON'T. WE DON'T NEED IT. Shane: I'M VERY TIRED. I HAVE BEEN TAKING CARE OF HER, AND I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN 48 HOURS. AND SHE SLEPT FOR THREE DAYS PRETTY MUCH. KIM, I'M TOO TIRED TO MAKE THIS TREK IN ONE DAY. IT COULD BE MILES THROUGH THIS *BLEEP*, SO HERE'S WHAT I HAVE IN MIND FOR THE MORNING. WE WAKE UP, WE GET OUT OF HERE, WE STARTED HEADING TOWARDS OUR EXTRACTION POINT NEAR THE WATERFALL, AND MAKE CAMP ABOUT HALFWAY SO IT'S NOT SUCH A LONG TREK FOR ME. JUST KIND OF GET STARTED EARLY? YEAH. I LIKE IT. BUT THE HARDEST PART HASN'T EVEN STARTED YET. I'M REALLY EXHAUSTED. Shane: AND TO PHYSICALLY WALK ALONG THIS RIVER AND NOT FALL AND BREAK A LEG OR AN ARM OR SOMETHING IS JUST GONNA BE...NOT FUN. Shane: KIM, ARE YOU GETTING THIRSTY? THIS ONE, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CUT. THERE YOU GO. THAT IS SUCH AN AWESOME FEELING, BEING ABLE TO JUST WALK UP TO A VINE AND CHOP IT AND GET WATER OUT OF IT. IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE EVER DRANK WATER VINE. IT TASTES LIKE CLEAN, BEAUTIFUL WATER. IT'S AMAZING. THERE'S SO MUCH IN IT. IT'S LIKE A JUNGLE FAUCET. ONCE WE MOVE, I'M JUST GONNA START SHUTTING DOWN. I JUST DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT IN MY GAS TANK. Narrator: TWO DAYS REMAIN OF SURVIVAL EXPERTS SHANE AND KIM'S 21-DAY CHALLENGE IN COSTA RICA, BUT THE WORST IS YET TO COME. THEIR MAP SHOWS THAT THEIR EXTRACTION POINT, MARKED BY A WATERFALL, LIES SEVERAL MILES TO THE SOUTHEAST. THE ROUTE WINDS ALONG A ROCKY, STEEP-SIDED RIVERBED SURROUNDED BY IMPENETRABLE JUNGLE. WITH KIM INCAPACITATED BY FOOD POISONING FOR THREE DAYS, SHANE HAS HAD TO PROVIDE FOR TWO PEOPLE -- KIM AND HIMSELF. WEAKENED BY THE PHYSICAL STRAIN, SHANE IS NOW DEPLETED AND DESPERATELY WORRIED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO MAKE THE FINAL TREK. Kim: TODAY IS DAY 20. WE'RE GONNA TRY TO TREK HALFWAY OUT TO THE EXTRACTION POINT AND CAMP FOR A NIGHT SO THAT, ON THE LAST DAY, WE DON'T HAVE SUCH A LONG HIKE. AND I JUST HOPE THAT SHANE CAN MAKE IT BECAUSE HE IS VERY WEAK. AND THE MOST I CAN DO FOR HIM IS SUPPORT HIM BY STICKING TOGETHER THROUGHOUT THIS TREK. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE READY TO GO. HOW ARE YOU DOING? I FEEL LIKE I'M IN THE HIMALAYAS. I'M SO TIRED. Kim: I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SHANE. HE'S SUFFERING A LITTLE MORE THAN I AM RIGHT NOW, AND I FEEL FOR HIM. AND I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP. AAH! AAH! YEAH, THIS IS SO MUCH *BLEEP* FUN! Shane: KIM, I CAN'T GO ANY FURTHER. I PHYSICALLY CANNOT GO ANY FURTHER. OKAY. THERE'S A DRY SPOT UNDER THAT HUGE TREE OVER THERE. I DON'T CARE. WHATEVER YOU WANT. YOU WANT TO GO UP THERE? LET'S GO UP THERE. IT'S FINE. WHATEVER YOU WANT. COME ON. LET'S GO. YOU WANT TO SIT UNDERNEATH THIS *BLEEP* WELL, I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE HAVE TO. I'M JUST SAYING -- BUT I DON'T GIVE A *BLEEP* JUST PICK A SPOT, PLEASE. WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT WE CAN CHECK THIS PLACE OUT. JUST PICK A *BLEEP* SPOT, PLEASE, OKAY? THAT'S WHAT YOU LIKE RIGHT THERE? THAT'S FINE. IT'S AS GOOD AS ANY. Kim: IF YOU ARE REALLY THAT EXHAUSTED, I WOULD RATHER YOU JUST SIT DOWN INSTEAD OF TAKING IT OUT ON ME. I WOULD LIKE US TO TREAT EACH OTHER AS HUMAN BEINGS AND HELP EACH OTHER GET THROUGH THIS HELL OF A NIGHT. I'M SORRY I SNAPPED AT YOU. I JUST HAD NO ENERGY, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO DEBATE WHERE WE WERE GOING. THAT'S WHY I WAS JUST LIKE, "I'M DONE." IT'S OUR LAST NIGHT. WE'VE MOVED TO A NEW SPOT. WE DON'T HAVE OUR CANOPY. WE DON'T HAVE OUR PLATFORM. LOOKING AROUND, AND IT IS DARK. I AM VERY NERVOUS ABOUT THE PREDATORS THAT ARE IN THIS AREA. [ MONKEYS HOOTING ] THIS MORNING, KIM IS GOING TO MARK UP HER BODY IN CHARCOAL. Kim: THESE ARE MY SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION OF THE LAST 21 DAYS, AND WHEN I WASH IT OFF, I WILL BE DONE. LEAD THE WAY. [ WATER SPLASHES ] [ GRUNTS ] YOU OKAY? [ COUGHS ] ARE YOU INJURED? I'M NOT INJURED. I'M JUST HURT. THAT ONE'S VERY SLIPPERY. YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO HANG ON TO THE ROCK. [ SOBS ] BE VERY CAREFUL ON THAT ONE. AND I CAN HELP PULL YOU UP. I WANT TO BE BY MYSELF. *BLEEP* GETTING HURT. WE'RE ALMOST THERE, SHANE. YEAH, RIGHT. I'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN I *BLEEP* SEE IT. SHANE, THIS IS IT. IT'S THE END OF THE RIVER. WOW! IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S AMAZING. AND THAT IS HOW BEAUTIFUL THE JUNGLE CAN BE. TO BE ABLE TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS AFTER SPENDING 21 DAYS SUFFERING, IT'S JUST AWESOME. Kim: THESE ARE OUR LAST MOMENTS IN THE JUNGLE. AND EVEN THOUGH MY STOMACH IS KILLING ME AND I'M SO HUNGRY AND SO EXCITED TO GET OUT, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. THERE'S A PATH FOR US TO TAKE UP TO THE EXTRACTION POINT. LET'S GO. I CAN SEE A CLEARING. LET'S WALK TOGETHER. WE DID IT. WE'RE FINALLY HERE. Kim: I WENT THROUGH A LOT OF CHALLENGES. I REALLY SUFFERED, BUT I GOT THROUGH IT. FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, I'LL BE REALLY PROUD OF MYSELF FOR DOING THIS. SHANE, WE DID IT. THIS IS IT. Shane: IT JUST TOOK EVERYTHING I HAD. BUT I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR BEING BROKEN TO REMIND ME WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN. OHH! I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING ELSE EVER. Shane: BYE, JUNGLE. BYE-BYE, JUNGLE. GOODBYE, COSTA RICA. BYE, COSTA RICA. YEAH! OUT OF HERE! WHOO! Narrator: SHANE AND KIM SURVIVED A GRUELING 21 DAYS IN THE JUNGLE OF COSTA RICA. THEY BOTH GAINED A MUTUAL RESPECT AND A GREATER RESPECT FOR THE WILD. SHANE LOST A TOTAL OF 45 POUNDS, AND KIM 26 POUNDS. SHANE IS NOW BACK HOME IN CONNECTICUT AND IS WORKING ON A BOOK ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE. KIM HAS RETURNED TO HER STUDIES IN MINNESOTA AND IS PLANNING HER NEXT EXPEDITION. SURVIVAL EXPERTS REVIEWED SHANE AND KIM IN TERMS OF THEIR SKILLS, EXPERIENCE, AND MENTAL APPROACH, AND REASSESSED THEM BOTH ACCORDING TO HOW THEY COPED WITH THEIR CHALLENGE. SHANE DISPLAYED HUGE BRAVERY AND A STRONG WILL TO SURVIVE. KIM'S SURVIVAL SKILLS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY. SHANE'S TROUBLED ATTITUDE TOWARDS KIM MEANT THAT THEY STRUGGLED TO WORK EFFECTIVELY AS A TEAM. NEVERTHELESS, THEY CAME TO RELY UPON EACH OTHER AND GOT THROUGH THE 21 DAYS TOGETHER. OVERALL, SHANE'S PSR GOES UP TO 8.4, WHILE KIM, IN SPITE OF HUGE OBSTACLES, IMPROVES TO 7.8. THIS EXPERIENCE PROVED THAT SHANE AND KIM BOTH HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO SURVIVE NAKED AND AFRAID. THIS IS THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.
