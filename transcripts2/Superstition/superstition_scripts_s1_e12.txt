Calvin, son of Rozan.

 Do you hear me? Everything just feels a little off. Hard to explain. Hard or embarrassing? Which one? You trying to psychoanalyze me now? No. I'm just saying you're acting like someone with something to hide. I'm guessing you came here because you wanted to talk. I'm with that, but I just wish you would've called first. But it's fine. I didn't mean to cramp your style. There's nobody else here, Calvin. We both know it's not about that. Okay, well, I've been having trouble sleeping... - PTSD. - ...and it's not PTSD.

 - Denial... - It's not denial. Good. Good. Because denying denial would be just wrong, right? We are stronger as one. Because, Calvin, after everything I'm glad we can still talk, and be friends. And you know, honestly, I've been having problems sleeping myself. Well, we both know what that is, don't we? Hmm. We need to stop running from each other. Start accepting the imperfections of this thing called "life." I thought you agreed to respect my wishes. - True. - Sure. But, maybe what we both need to help us sleep is... Less emotional and more biological. Okay, yeah. I've been there, done that. I'm good. - Okay. - Good. You said we are both alone here, right? You're really acting way creepier than your usual, Calvin. All right? - Let's just... - Hey. Okay. You know, maybe you should get some rest. - You should just... - Oh! Hey. There she is. - Calvin? - I know what you smell like. I really think that you need to just go home, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Just... - Wait, wait, wait, wait. I think first you have something to show me. What do you have in here? Ooh! - I'm gonna enjoy taming you. - Calvin... I do not want to hurt you, okay? Get off of me! Hey. Hey, guys. There she is. May, to be continued. I'll let myself out. And what was that about? Nothing. Nothing. An action packed conversation with your father. God. Uh, I got both of the pies. They're in the kitchen. So, you know, the taste challenge is on if you're ready. Right, I, actually promised Russ I'd head back over to his place. I just... - I can't seem to find my... - Your phone. I was going to call you and tell you it was here, but... - It was here. - Thanks, Mom. - Yeah. - Right? Mmm-hmm. - Okay. - Okay. - Love you. - I, I love you. Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com I don't know. Something was definitely going on. Well, maybe you interrupted their sexy time. No. And I've been there, done that. This one was different. I mean... The touch was like the opposite of sexy. Calvin was being really weird. Well, what do you mean? He usually has two settings. Really intense or really chilling. I don't know. This one was new. Well, maybe it's because, you know... I think, the older that couples get, they wanna fight more than they have sex. You know what I'm saying? What? Why? Well, it's usually because they're not having enough sex. So, let's make sure that doesn't happen with us. Russ, we're not even having sex. I know, but I've been practicing. And that's a wrap. Come on, Garv. I was joking. Hold on, wait. Seriously, look. I wanted you to come by to show you this. What is this? Well, it's just a little database I made to help out with the infernal ass kickin' cause. See, based on the information you've told me, some have sonic powers. Like, they'll blow your ears out. Like the Herald, right? Oh, those are psychic mind benders, like The Dredge, and others are just bad-ass strong guys. Russ, this is nice. Does this leave any... Any breadcrumbs across the Dark Web? Nah. I made sure it's not traceable. Okay. - Like it? - It's not bad. Mmm-hmm. Oh, God. Another dinner. But another voter. Oh, no. You've got a second before I call security, okay? I trust you can count to one. One. What the... He's been saying that he's having a problem sleeping. Do you remember anything out of the ordinary about him? Anything at all? Big, small, I just need you to think. Well, he does like to stare off into nothing a lot, you know? Comes in and out of the house at all hours of the night, but, honestly, killing infernals is not really a 9-to-5-er. Well, uh... Maybe he's not acting like himself because he isn't. PTSD? Exactly. He experienced heavy combat in Afghanistan. You know, 20% of veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq suffer from PTSD and divorce. Insomnia is a common symptom. You know, the mood swings, the aggression. It makes perfect sense. Wait a minute. You're also describing the symptoms of onset possession. Onset who now? No, I know. I know what possession is. I just hadn't processed that. I've been living with the Hastings long enough to know that anything is possible. I don't think that's what it is. But in the off chance that it is something supernatural, I need your help. I need you to keep an eye on him, please. Scan him with that infrared, infernal finder... - Yeah, I got it. - ...thing that you have. Yeah. You know, you could also just arrest him. You're kind of a cop. Arrest him for what? I don't know. Plant something. Not funny. Woah, woah, what are you gonna do? I'm going to go find some answers that are obviously not here. Calvin? - Calvin. - Hey, stranger. Stranger. Much as I would love to believe that you came all the way up here looking for me, I am observing our new all-business rules apply. So you have an infernal for me to handle? You are in a much better mood. Calvin, you attacked me. - What? - You heard me. This is my first time seeing you in days. - Yeah, Mom. What's up? - Hey. Hey, when was the last time you saw Calvin? Earlier with you at home. Why? No reason. See you later. Okay. Bye. What happened? What did I do? Tell me. You wanted me, and I wouldn't. And then Garvey walked in and she interrupted. But I... I get it, you know. I understand. I knew in my heart you wouldn't just do that. But something in me would. - And what if Garvey hadn't walked in? - Shit, I'd have shot you. May, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Yeah. What can I do? I found this clinic, and they specialize in PTSD. The problem, May, is me. - It's not... - I killed my brother. Wait. Whoa, there's way more to that than just... You couple that with what I did to my father. Calvin. The infernal that faced Arlo, - he said I had a dark soul. - Okay, listen, listen. If this ring is making you act like that, you need to just take it off. Might have started with the ring, but... But what? Now you think it's infected you? - Just take it off. - I cannot. - You can. Just take... - I cannot take it off! What if Isaac puts this ring on? And he is immortal. He could wipe out the planet. No, I need to deal with this myself. - I cannot be a risk to the family - Whoa, whoa, - and to you. - Calvin. What are you saying right now? That I need to huddle with Isaac. We're gonna get in the Alchemy room and figure out a way to take care of it. It's what we do. I'm so sorry. Whoa, we got us a diamond cutter right here. Man, you captured every branch in that rune, son. Learned from the best. No, you better than me now, boy. I'm not sure how I feel about that. I mean, you got you a powerful bullet right there. Most runes take out an infernal, maybe a human, but this here... This will take out whatever it comes in contact with, clothes, jewelry, everything. Hmm. A nuke in a bullet. Nuke in a bullet. Yeah. So, why are you making it? Wanted the carving challenge. Plus, like you always said, it's better to have a nuke and not need it than need it and not have it. I never said that. You make me sound like Kim Jong Il or some shit. Well, if you want it, it's yours. Pop, I know I've complained a lot, but... Coming back here, being with you and the family, I wouldn't trade it for anything. My daddy, your granddaddy, used to say to me back in the village, "Rozan, they are tomorrow people." People are focused on how good things will be tomorrow. What am I gonna get done tomorrow? How much money or wealth am I gonna have tomorrow? And then there are yesterday people. People that always look backwards, focusing on the past. "We had a good time yesterday. "We were in a better shape yesterday. "We had fun yesterday." But very, very few today people. Most people don't know that right now... This moment is the gift. And that's why they call it the present. You just did that. Thank you for that. Where's that coming from? Sometimes things get lost in the shuffle. Just thought you should know. Yes, they do. I'm proud of you. You okay? Never better. Uh, I mean, May filled me in... It's just... I thought, um... You know, Pop and I, we're getting close to finding a spell to wipe this whole thing out. - Good. - It's looking good. Good, good, that's great. I'm sorry about everything. What? No, don't be. No trust has been broken here. Thanks for looking out for May, too. You know, you've helped hold this business and family together. I just wanted to let you know. I see you. And I love you for it. Like it or not, you've become a sister to me. Aw. Thank you, Calvin. You're like a brother to me. Oh, careful. You know I'm a little... Bloody. But thank you. We'll hug later. Isaac, I thought you were supposed to be in the Alchemy room with Calvin. - Doing what? - The spell. He said you guys were closing in on it. Nope. Not doing any spells. Okay. Well, then I think Calvin is in trouble. Calvin is many things, but he is a thinker. Whatever he's doing, he'd have a plan. What if his plan didn't include getting help from us? Sounds like he's trying to protect us. We have a deal. No, we don't. Mr. Mayor. Why did you send your son to kill me? If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead. He tried carving me up like a Thanksgiving turkey. Well, from the looks of things, he didn't want you dead either. Against my better judgment, I decided to directly approach the man behind the attack. But make no mistake... There are a lot of ways I could have reacted. And those methods are still on the table. I appreciate you coming to me, without starting a war. How'd you get past my gates? What? Tilly. - Uh, yeah? - Go check on the wards, please. Will do. I still need to talk to your son. I'll talk to him first. If it's as you say, he'll come to you and he'll make this right. Fair enough. Mr. Mayor. - Thank you. - Thank you. The wards are gone, which means... The grounds, the graveyard... Even the house, it's all vulnerable to infernal attack. Who would do such a thing? Maybe it's a what. Calvin... Where have you been, son? I want to talk to you. I was handling some things first. What kind of things? Things of a personal variety. Looks like some of those personal items are from our Alchemy room. - And why would that be? - I could tell you. But then, it would spoil the surprise. I'm a big boy. It's not my birthday, I think I can handle the disappointment. Keep what's in the bag... It's time for me to wear the ring. Would you mind? Bet you didn't see that one coming, did you? Calvin, you got to fight this... - I get to fight the immortal one, - Son... known as the headless wonder, from the body - of his own offspring. - Calvin... Calvin! Calvin! Son! Pop? Pop? - I need... - I know! I know! - I need... - I know! You to get the hell off me. How does your son put up with all your God-complex bullshit? With some difficulty. Right about now... Calvin's enjoying this. No, son. Calvin! Calvin! Son! Fight it! - Fight it! - Shut up. You'll live. I don't know how long it takes you to regenerate, so... Just to be on the safe side... I'm keeping some of this. This ain't goodbye. I had no idea how many different variations of infernals there were. Yeah. And unlike humans, they're not all created equal. - Hey, Calvin. - We've kept you at the kid's table long enough. It's time to step up. You ready? You don't have to get ready if you're born ready. Good. You sound ready enough to me. Now, meet me at the mouth of the old cave in the woods just off the Exansus and Carline road junction. And, Garvey, come alone. Trust no one. Okay. That crossing's at the edge of the woods. I could hear him through your phone. He's bit of a loud talker. Let's go. Russ, we're not going anywhere. What? Is this because of the whole "don't trust anyone" thing? He said that for everyone outside the Hastings circle. - But I'm inside. - Right. Ah... Seriously, when we were in the clock zone, - I saved your life. Come on. - Really? Okay. Almost. But I have kept every secret, and never judged you. Garv, listen... Come on. Just let me drive you. Russ, forget it. Okay? I'm still coming. My brother's Jeep. I mean, he's super... - Okay. Stop. Stop! - Okay, okay. I think I see some lights over there, okay? - I'm gonna go, just stay here. - Okay. I'll sit tight. Don't worry. But listen, if you or your old man need me, just shoot me a text. I'm here for back up. - Seriously. I'm ready. - Yeah. Oh, Calvin. Geez. That how you address your father? That shit ends today. You will learn to respect and obey. - Have you been tainted? - What? Are you a virgin? She better be. Russ. What's going on? You're perfect. No, no, no, no. How did The Dredge know the body was there? 'Cause Calvin knew. The Dredge was able to access his mind somehow, obvi. The Dredge tricked his ass. Wait. So, if... If he's in Calvin's mind, then that means what happened to Dr. Kim, - is that what's gonna happen to Calvin? - No, no. Dr. Kim was a host for The Dredge. He's not in Calvin's mind. Right now, he's trapped in the ring, and can only access Calvin's mind from there. It's like a computer hacker, from a distance it could take over your computer or air traffic control, or shut down a dam, - or even cause a core meltdown... - Tilly. Bottom line is this. The Dredge took that old host body for a reason. Because no infernal can go from being trapped in the Ring of Solomon, which is a prison, to controlling the person that wears the ring. Right. If he was fully possessing Calvin, he wouldn't need to steal the old host. That's right. You know, the ring should have a manual, or at least a downloadable PDF option. Tilly, what else is missing from the morgue? 'Cause clearly my son is building something. Let's see, there's some surgical supplies, some clamps, tubes, chemical bottles... Oh, and my robe from the downstairs bathroom. Truth time. I do get a little too dirty to go upstairs. He attacked you, but he left you alive. Why? Yeah. He wanted your blood. That's gotta be it. She's right. All right, everybody, start researching the re-animation of dead infernals, and possible usages of their blood. Oh, got it! Over here. Okay. "The resurrection of infernal hosts..." La-di-da... "Death and destruction..." Okay, here it is. So, among the needed elements, you need the blood of an infernal, an immortal, - and a virgin. - A virgin. Well, good luck finding one of those in La Rochelle... Sh-sh-sh-shit! Garvey... Garvey, baby, I need you to call me right back, as soon as you get this message. This is not a game. This is a true emergency. You call me right back. Okay. It says here, the spell will do more than just re-animate The Dredge's first host. If completed... The body will become impervious to anything of this Earth. So, if the spell works and Dredge 1.0 becomes invulnerable, then what? We throw everything we got at him. Even if it's just to slow his ass down. May. These have a more potent form of rune on each bullet. Excuse me, pardon me. Hate to be the proverbial turd in the punch bowl here, but there's been no discussion about finding him. Okay, I'm sorry, why is he with us again? Because I know The Dredge's weaknesses, and I just got cut. May. Nothing bonds people together like the common enemy, and we got one now. So... This is a chance we're gonna have to take. What about her? Oh, I deal with dead infernals, not live ones. Damascus steel. - It will cut through anything. - To that end, we are stronger and more powerful united. We cannot afford to fail. All right. Tilly, you know what we need from you. I dont't know, Isaac, it's not like ordering a pizza. I get that. But desperate times require desperate measures. We will get the whole world ready to give! Drown the swamp, for real! Thank you for sending that, boy. Now the whole gang will be here for the resurrection. Please, Dad, stop, don't hurt him. Please! Dad! You can do it. Get it done. Or not. What a stirring vote of confidence. - Mutually give pep talks. - Where the hell are we going? I just got a location message. Russ says they're near the cave quarry. That's probably all he could send with the Dredge standing over him. That's why we're taking the tunnels. - Tunnels? - With all the wards removed, we're vulnerable to an infernal attack. We don't want them to track us to The Dredge, and team forces with him. So, you have tunnels running underneath the house? Oh, yeah. We've got the underground railroad. - Did you know about this? - Hey, I'm new here. Damn, I had no idea the caves ran this far under your house. Just like the human body, the Earth has meridians. Pressure points. Meridians as in like longitude and latitude? No, mystical meridians are certain spots on the globe that emit energy. There's rock in Australia, Stonehenge, the Sedona vortex. Sometimes the energy is of peace, and other times it's of power. The La Rochelle meridian is also a portal. That's why we infernals come through here. It's also why Isaac founded the town here. You know, he was quite a good Mayor. Not a job I want. Too much ass-kissing and paperwork. He's manipulating the power meridian. Oh, my God. I feel it. Meridian time trap. Shit! I hate meridian time traps. - May? - Yeah. Listen, with rune bullets we don't have many, - so fire in sort bursts. - Gotcha. - Bickley, you good? - Yeah. I prefer pushing paper, and kissing asses. But I'm good. - Bea? - Yeah. I'm good. Let's move out. Wait, wait, wait. What's this meridian shit... I need some answers... - Please! Don't... - Please... Please, Mr. Hastings, don't do this! Shut up! This is a family affair. I never wanted you near my daughter anyway. Yes! The blood's discolorating. Stop! Stop! Come on, Calvin. I knew you were smart when I met you. I told old Isaac to watch out for you. Take your time, son. You can't hurry love. Si dominae. Say the words. Yes, free at last. Free at last! Thank God Almighty, he's free at last! Welcome, Hastings. - Garvey! - May, wait... - May! - May, wait! Let them go. It's me you want. I have what I want. Yes. Unlike you humans, I'm a compassionate being. I have no need for hostages. Are you trying to have us believe that you have everything you want? Your beliefs matter little. I admire your loving family. The family that's struck down together, stays together. Don't... ...shoot! I had so looked forward to making a house call. That's why I sent Calvin to dig up the wards. That's right. - I know all your secrets. - Yeah. I know all your tricks. Well, I have met your family now, and it is time for you to meet my brethren. Born again! We born again. Kill 'em all! Isaac, behind you! Come on. Come on! Come on! Help me. Help me, help me! - Get her. Hurry up! - Come on. Come on. Come on. Get out! - Check her out! - I've got you. All right. Garvey... Garvey, baby, I don't have many rune bullets, all right? I'm gonna need some of that Hocus pocus from you. I want you to protect her, okay? - Just trust me. Okay? - Oh... Nice. All right, Garvey, me and you, I need you to do that thing you do here. I'm trying! Okay. Come back to me. Come back to me. Focus. Focus. Come on. Come back to me. - Come back to me, Calvin. - Ma. There you go, son. Garvey! May! - Isaac? - They're good. Is that any way to treat an old friend, son of Isaac? James... What are you doing here? You think I'd let you have all that fun by yourself, now did you? Isaac threw up the bat signal. - You're okay? - Yeah. - You're okay, son. - You okay? Yes, I'm okay. You okay? - Ready to fight. - Okay. James... It's good to have you back. Go, go, go, go, go. Pop! - May and Garvey? - Over there. Go! I'll cover you. Garvey! Shoot 'em! What? Damn you, Hastings! That was my last nuke bullet. Now, please, can I get some help? - I'm trying, it's not working! - Come on, baby, just concentrate. Remember what your grandpa taught you. The only way I could ever hit one of those things is if I get lucky! Baby, luck is preparation meeting opportunity. As in, right now! You sound just like Grandpa. Come on, baby! Come on, baby! That's it. Good job, baby. Nope! That's it. Keep it going! Ma... What? Calvin! Immortal! I want you to watch you family die, one by one. Calvin! - Pop! - No, no, no... Your son bore witness to your beheading. Actually, he was a little more hands-on than that. So, I think that you will agree that turnabout's fair play. No! - This is not over! - No! That's for taking my robe, you fallopian tube. Ever heard of boundaries? Equinox wiccans... Prepare to meet your demise. Garvey! Get in the circle, Bea, complete it! We present earth, air, fire, and complete with the metal from the great goddess and Oak King. These are the elements of this Earth that shall purify the dark matter! Get him down! Never turn your back on your ex. Not of this Earth! Hold him down! I told you this ain't over. Hold on! - I'll get May! - Garvey! Tilly! Come on, hold it down! Come on! Nobody let go! - Keep it central! - Hold on! Hold on! Okay. Ah! Isaac! - Bea, hold on, baby! - Don't let go of me! - Ma! - I can't do it! Hang on, May! - Can't do it! - Come on, everybody, hang on! You can do this! - Russ, you're slipping! - I can't hold on! - Hang on! - Russ! - Garvey! - No. No! No! Russ! Russ! Hold on! Calvin. - You okay? - Yeah. May. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Tilly, you good? - Good, yeah. Yeah. Garvey? Garvey! Where is she? You okay? You okay? Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Russ... My brother's car. Bea? Bea? No! Bea! - No! Grandma! No... - Wait, wait... Bea... No. No, baby. Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com
