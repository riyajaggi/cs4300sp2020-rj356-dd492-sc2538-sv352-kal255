 Last time, on "Superstition"... I've gone by many names. - What are you? - The Dredge. He's not gonna stop until he's dead. He knows Dad's weak spot. You're going on a date with Calvin. - No, it's not. - Hookup, whatever you wanna call it. Definitely not a hookup. - You would have to be... - 778 years old... To be exact. Mom!

 Mom, I'm home! Oh, God, she should not be home right now! Go! Go, go, go! The closet, the closet! - The closet? - The closet! Go! Go! Shit! Just go to the closet! Oh, my God! - So get this... - Mm-hmm. I told Mr. Preston that Founder's Day was lame, because, I mean, we're basically celebrating ripping off the Native Americans' land. - Uh-huh. - And... The vengeful cretin made me Social Chair of Founder's Day. Well, you know, if you...

 If you don't have anything nice to say, maybe you should just try saying it vaguely. Maybe do something with your photography. It's inside out. - What? - Your T-shirt, it's inside out. I was just about to go and take a shower. Right. Well, I'm gonna let you get back to whatever it is you were doing. Calvin? You can come out now, playboy. You can come out now! That went well. This is completely crazy. - Yeah, not a good look. - No, it's not. Our daughter seeing us like this and we don't even know what this is. I'm usually much better about shielding her from my private life, thank you. My... I... I can't. Yeah, I understand. No. No, you don't. Neither does she. Neither do I. Yes, we are very good together still, but that... Stop looking at me! That's not enough. It's close. Come on. Been a father two months. No one's ready for this, but here we are. I can't do this. Can't do this with me? You left your life here once before. Protecting Garvey is my number one priority. As a parent, I'm sure, you understand that. Chief Westbrook. The Mayor wants me to represent the department. Yeah, sure. Yeah, happy Founder's Day to you, too. Something... Excuse me. You let yourself out. Way to go, Calvin. Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com ?a va, ch?rie? Qu'est-ce que tu fais? Mmm. I missed you. I missed you. Good, you're back. You're back, you're okay? - I'm good. - You look good. - You look good. - I feel good. Okay, well, let me be the judge of that. - Oh, come on. - Ah. Okay. Mmm-hmm. You're healed. Healed. Oh, you're back just in time to sample two of my latest healing oils. Um... - Aloe-lavender. - Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Versus... Roasted cinnamon, infused with vitamin E. - Mmm. - All edible. Organic. Oh, from your secret garden. Yes, my secret garden. Come here. I'm gonna bring everyone up to speed later, on my travels and The Dredge. I just wanted a moment alone with you. How you holding up? Oh, Calvin meeting James. That was challenging. For Calvin, or for you? Both. Wish I'd known James was coming. I feel like he's angling for something. Not to mention, he seems to know you better than anyone else. James and I have history. He can be helpful under the right circumstances. Things were moving fast. I needed someone to keep an eye on my family in my absence. James is at his best when he feels needed. What about our son? Calvin? - Calvin. - Calvin has been doing a great job. But this is a marathon of sprints. Are we really sure that he's ready to train for this? For what we do, Bea? Hmm? And if he's not and something were to happen to him... What then? Either way... He needs you to talk to him. I mean, he has... He has a lot of questions. It's not fair to shut him out. I'll answer any question he has. But it's gotta come from him. - He's a grown-ass man. - Yes, he is. Hmm. Left side. The lavender shea? That's the lavender shea? - That's lavender. - That's good stuff. Come here. I want to show you something. - Look in the mirror. - Yeah. - Do you see that queen in the mirror? - Mmm-hmm. That's you, Bea. No one has ever... Ever known me like you, my queen. And no one ever will. The Dredge followed me out of La Rochelle, just as planned. But after a couple of weeks, I realized he wasn't tracking me anymore. So he could be anywhere? I think he's back here. Which means he's after more than just me. May, what did you find out? Uh, this guy is a land developer out of Louisiana. - He went missing a while back. - Tilly? This is different than other possessions. He's not merely a spirit inhabiting a host and then moving on. Meaning what? Meaning The Dredge left this poor guy for dead. Used him like a meat suit. It would take a large toll on the man's body, so, if anything, there'd be some sort of signature left behind. Like a fingerprint. Exactly. If I can find that, we can know a lot more about The Dredge. You said part of your mission was to find a weapon to help beat The Dredge. Any luck with that? I found a couple of things, son. Whether they work or not remains to be seen. Great. So if you're right and The Dredge is back here, he could be inhabiting anyone. Even one of us. The surgery was supposed to be a routine appendectomy, instead I got a peek-and-shriek, so heads up. Running late. Dr. Kim! - You forgot something. - What? This. See you tomorrow! Now... Where are the Hastings? We're closed! Who are you? And what do you want? A new face. Same dark soul. You got something for me? Reflected in this, you can see stories from around the globe. And? A deal's a deal. You were right to be curious. I believe that is the Ring of Solomon, himself. You've been searching for that ring for a long time, haven't you? Could it be that the ones you seek are trapped within it? Where is Isaac Hastings now? That was not part of our bargain. Our business is concluded. Souvenirs from your trip? Yeah. The Dredge is out there. We gotta be ready. Got a lot on your mind, huh? That's an understatement. All these years, you let me believe you were responsible for Arlo's death. Why? You do what you can to protect your family, son. Really? Is that what you're doing? Protecting us? Are you sure we aren't some expendable soldiers to be used in your private army? This isn't a private war, son. I didn't ask for this shit. How many other families have you had before us? How many other wives and kids died fighting by your side? Far too many. You're my own father and I don't even know you. How long has this fight been going on? And why do you do it? - And what's the story with James? - Calvin. Why do you choose to train and trust him and not me? You made a decision when you left here, son. If you stayed, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Now, you're asking questions. Good questions, son. But be sure you really wanna know the answers. Because knowing places you in jeopardy. So what do you really want? I want the truth. Nothing remarkable thus far. Removing skull cap now... Whoa. Seems like there's some kind of dark tentacles covering up the frontal lobes. Gross. Founder's Day has always been very important to La Rochelle. - Uh, Chief Westbrook - Sorry. is here to address the security concerns for our Founder's Day festivities. - Good morning, everyone. - Good morning. The Ladies' Bridge and Pie-Baking Club requests a booth. - All in favor, say aye. - Aye. Peter's Peanuts also requests a booth. All in favor, say aye. Aye. - All in favor, say aye. - Aye. Mrs. Beatrice Hastings has requested a booth to display her new line of Bea's Butters. Um, the Hastings have never really been a part of this. She probably uses the fat from the dead bodies to make the body butter. Yeah, like in Fight Club. We've all heard the rumors. I saw why take the chance on scaring folks away? It'll hurt our business. The Hastings family has been very good to us. Spencer, man! You live right next door to the Hastings. You just don't want them to find out you voted against them. They'll put a voodoo hurting on your ass. Okay, folks, listen up. Please. The rules that you all swore to uphold are very clear. As long as they pay their deposit and uphold the regulations, they are granted a booth. - Is that correct? - That's right. Thank you. Sir. The oral vote is strictly ceremonial. Unless you can prove that the applicant has broken a law or is otherwise unfit to participate, it's really quite simple. Josephina Wainwright. She died on my operating table. Her son Trevor was away at med school. When he found out, he was heartbroken. He was gonna drop out and use the tuition money to pay for her funeral. And that's when I called the Hastings family. They gave her a lovely burial. And when it came time for payment, you know what they told Trevor? "Go become a doctor, like Josephina prayed for. Go help folks out and help others out, whether they have money or not. And that will be payment enough for us." I mean, look where we are. What would Jesus do? Last week, I saw a bunch of college kids taking pictures of the Hastings house just because it's creepy and they read about it online. Hell, um... La Rochelle sure could use tourism. And, um... I guess we could use all the help we can get. - Hmm. - All right. Let's get this vote over with and break for lunch. All in favor of the Hastings booth, say aye. Aye. - All opposed, say... - Nay. Come on, honey. Thank you so much for the kind words. Sure. I don't ever recall hearing you speak up like that before. Oh, there's a lot about me you don't know. How about you let me catch you up over lunch? Yeah. All right. This is a memory crystal. Now... In the theory of reincarnation, every time someone is born again, they have no recollection of their past life and this enables them to start fresh each time. You're saying you believe in reincarnation? I'm saying that when you live as long as I do you have to have a place to store your memories, or you'll overload. The human brain can only hold so much Put that around your waist. Strap it up. Now, when was the last time you ate? Breakfast, why? As a kid, you used to have a sensitive stomach. Everyone reacts differently. - I think my tummy will be just fine. - Oh, that's good. Tough guy, put two drops in each eye. That's right, it's blue. Put it in. All right. The eyewear stays on at all times. It's gonna be like looking into the sun to the second power. Take it. You may feel some pain in your frontal lobe. It's like a brain freeze on steroids. That's normal. Also, some nausea. That's also normal. Anything else is not. If it gets too... You listening to me? If it gets too intense in there, I'll be right there with you. Call me. I'll take us out. We're good. Ah, shit! It'll pass! Stay with it! All right. We're good. What do you see? Blinding light. Then we're in. Slow it down. Take deep rhythmic breaths. Slow it down. There you go, son. Walk it through. What's that? That's my mother, Nunu. - That's my grandmother? - Yeah. She's beautiful, isn't she? Yeah. Okay. We don't have that much time. I'm gonna jump you forward. Time is fleeting. The demons grow stronger and more cunning every day. We will only be able to choose one. But the responsibility... It is too great for one man. We have no choice. He must be the best among us. It will be a great honor. Yes. What about your son? No. His place is here in the Caliphate. Who is our best warrior? The best amongst us... is Razan. We have a few strong ones. But the most gifted and wise. It is Razan. Hmm, you know, you mustn't put anything on your skin, you wouldn't put in your mouth because we absorb everything. Hmm? You. You know, what karma is but do you know what dharma means? - No. - Dharma is one's life purpose. Making a living doing what you love is one of the secrets to a well lived life. So your life's purpose is putting make up on dead people and skin cream on the living. There is no better purpose than the service of others. I probably could have been a preacher too. Hmm? Okay. Why the sourpuss? What's wrong, honey? I caught them. My mom and Calvin. I caught them having sex. It's just like, it's not like they know each other, you know. Like... My mom doesn't do this. She just doesn't bring guys home. Okay, we are all just children, Garvey. We're all just works in progress or we wouldn't be here on this earth struggling to make it right. Okay, well, just keep it real. Maybe they were just being horny and stupid. Or maybe they are really into each other and are trying to figure it out. Hopefully without hurting you or themselves too much in the process. Look, can you just not tell my mom I said anything. No, I won't. But you should talk to her. Yeah? Okay. Come, let us get some more flowers then. What do you think? More rose, hmm? So the Templars and the Moors are the secret meaning. Nothing unites people like the common enemy, son. Sir Isaac Razan... Please stand. From this time forward, you shall know not death. We owe our allegiance to you. Lead the way. This is when you became immortal. You were chosen to keep the balance between good and evil. That's an over simplification, but yes. All rise. Teach me. So, what's the big news? I rigged up a customized Geiger-counter. It measures ionized radiation like Beta and Gama rays, anyway... Even though he's dead, his body is still emitting unusually high levels of Hawking radiation. Hawking, as in Stephen Hawking, the physicist? Exactly. It's kinda like a black hole, right? It... It absorbs all the light around it. Whoa! Wait... So if he is radio active, we can locate him. And we can figure out who he is now. So how's your head feeling? It took a pretty nasty hit. You didn't take much time off, did you? Ah, well, you know I've always been a little hard-headed. - I'm not gonna respond to that. - Smart. But since you went there. You remember the time at the old movie theater? I do. I do. When I stood up and accidentally head-butted that poor lady's drink - all over the place. - Uh-huh. And your linebacker boyfriend decided to take it out on me. Mmm-hmm. - Guess what? - What? - I'm operating on him next week. - Really? Wow. Life has some twists and turns to it, doesn't it? It sure does. You know, I never get to tell you how amazing, I mean, how you juggle at home being a single mother. Getting through police academy. You've done well. Have I? Sometimes I wonder. What's going on? Come on. I know you. You can't trust your doctor, who can you trust? I just know there's a difference between doing it all and doing it well. Is this about your daughter? You were always very protective about her. Yeah. And an old boyfriend has come back into town. We've been seeing a lot of each other and it's just... Everything just got really complicated and I don't do complicated well. You care about him, don't you? Is this the same guy, your first love? I remember when you used to talk about him... Used to make me a little jealous. He's the one that got away and broke your heart. I'm sorry. That ring contains the legions of demons I have caught over the centuries. I need you to hear their voices. I need you to concentrate. This Obi-Wan bullshit ain't working. Did you have sex recently? - What? - You heard me. It's a big exchange of energy. There's a reason why boxers don't do it before a fight. Who was she? What the hell is this Dr. Phil shit, man? May. Okay. See, now May is a good vibration match for you, son. Which means you should be strong, no excuses. Because good lovin' makes a man strong, see. Bea... Bea keeps me right and... The last thing I wanna hear about is you talking about... Then focus. Show me I'm not wasting my time. Straight on. Right between the trees. You hearing something? Don't fall for his trickery, baby. Hey, who's there? You left Arlo here burning in hell. - Ma? - And your daughter's not... Garvey? Razan doesn't give a shit about you, boy. You're a failure. You can't die. You can't die. Harness them. Don't let them control you. Harness them, Calvin. Many have died following him. He's right, isn't he? As soon as I'm dead, you'll start over. Careful, son. I taught you everything you know, and everything I don't. That's right. Don't let them turn you against me. Oh, you don't want to come for me, son. You ain't ready to come for me now. You look a little soft. You all right, son? Come on. Son, don't let them... That's it, get it out. Get it out. Don't gas out now. All right. Huh? You have to harness them, son. Let it out. Do it. Let it out. - Let it go, son. - I left because I hate you. I know. Better you hate me than hate yourself. - I killed my own brother. - No, no, no. - I killed my own brother. - Calvin! Look at me. No. An infernal did that. You did not. Now listen, I ran away from all this fight stuff many times. It didn't work for me. You're not tasked for this. This does not have to be your destiny. You don't have to stay here and protect me from death honestly. I've been doing this shit for hundreds of years. I'm good, but I want you to know something. I would do whatever I can, as your father, to protect you. Even if it meant being the villain in your life for a while. You knew. You knew those voices would get to me, didn't you? I thought they might. You cannot overcome the voices of fear and deception if you can't acknowledge the existence. Now you're starting to understand the power of that ring. You're starting to understand the battle. It's more than I could have imagined. I don't even know if I'm ready for this. I didn't know if I was ready. But if you ever are, Calvin, I'm here for you, to train you. You sayin' you'll teach me? Everything? The crystals, the freaky weaponry, the ring. We be stopping demon-ass together. Father and son. Whooping some demon ass. There's no time like the present, Pop. - Just get me ready. - Sure. I'm in. Carol, I think I'm just going to get the vegan burger to go. What a surprise! Mom, Dr. Kim. Garvey? We... We just saw each other at the Founder's Day meeting and decided to do some catching up over lunch. Sit down. Join us. You know, I would, but I don't want to interrupt. No, no, no, no, no. Okay, you can have a seat. Okay. You can order that meat ball sub you love with the extra sauce. Thanks, Mom, but remember, I'm vegan now. No dead animal flesh for me. Oh, I'm vegan in between meals. Oh, I've got to take this. Um, and stop at the ladies' room. We'll be right here, gossiping about you. Great. Well, you're what, a junior in high school now? - Yeah. - Yeah. So you thinking about colleges? Yep. Trying to get out of this town. I said the same thing. But there's something about this town that's... drawing people back. I left and... here I am now, back again. Seems to be happening a lot lately. Must be an epidemic or something. You're talking about your mom's old boyfriend? She told you about Calvin? Well, I'm her doctor. I'm sworn to secrecy. Honestly, I don't really know him that well. And? And... I don't know if I can trust him. Just because someone's your biological father doesn't... Doesn't make him your dad, you know. Calvin Hastings is your father? He really wasn't there very much for you growing up now, was he? All right, now that you know how powerful the voice is, of deceit and hate can be as a collective, I want you to master them individually. Yes, they are gonna shit talk. But as long as you don't give them power, you're gonna stay in command. Focus, right here. Good. Remember, these infernals are imprisoned in this ring for a reason. I want you to call forth the specific infernal, Skinny Jenkins. How will I recognize his voice? He's an old-school shit talker from Harlem. You'll recognize him. I've got nothing but time on my hands, baby. Bring him forward, son. It's not working. Look behind you. Templar Negros. Ain't this some shit. Isaac Razan... still as ugly as dog shit on new shoes. Let me guess. This little bitch-ass negro is another piece of rot from your undying family tree. This is my son who you're going to answer to. You sure he ready? He look a little soft to me. But I'm sure you got him all trained up just like the others. This one's a player. Don't let him game you. - What did he do? - Nothing to deserve this. That boy is smart. Be careful, boy. Old Isaac don't like nobody questioning his authority. Drug dealer. So poisoned he can't see. Now ain't that some hypocritical bullshit there. You humans are poisoning the whole world with your pollution and greed. Brother Curtis Mayfield said, If there's a hell below, y'all are gonna go. Niggers, crackers, police, stay backers, y'all want to dance with the devil and kill in the name of God. But God don't love you no more. That's what all this crazy weather is about. He trying to get rid of y'all. Armageddon is near. Smell like dead humans. Judgment day is coming. And unlike you, I got nothing but time on my hands. Time on my hands. Enough of this bullshit. Send him back. Skinny Jenkins, return to chamber. Say the exact words, son. Skinny Jenkins, prisoner of the house of Razan, return to chamber. I got nothing but time on my hands, Isaac. I'll be back. I got nothing but time on my hands... Okay, I'm back. So you all can stop gossiping about me now. Shh. Okay. My turn. Gonna check in with the hospital. Damn, phone is dead again. Oh, no, here, you can borrow mine. And take all the time you need. Garvey and I could really use the time to catch up. - If it rings, I'll bring it right back. - Thank you. Okay. I know this morning was confusing. - We don't have to talk about this. - We... We do. Calvin and I have agreed to figure us out before we involve you. What does that mean? That means its new for him, it's new for me. We... We still don't have all the answers, Garvey. Life has thrown us a curve ball and trust me, once you get a little bit older, you will understand. - Really? - Yes. I'm almost 17. I'm just a year younger than when you had me. I'm still a virgin. With all due respect, Mom, it's gonna stay that way, until I find someone who's not gonna run out on me. Ever. He left without even saying goodbye and you're just gonna let him back in. Garvey, he didn't know anything about you and that is on me. But it's not his fault. And what we are trying to do now is what we both feel is best for you. You have to believe that. It's not selfishness... So please, just act like everything is fine now. No. But you can at least recognize the try. You didn't even tell him about me. I grew up without a father for 16 years. I didn't have a choice. You didn't give him an option. And maybe he would have left, I don't know. But that option should have been there. Of course. I never... I never intended for him not to be in your life, Garvey. But don't let my mistakes turn you into this tough cookie. Tough does not age well. Tough breaks, flexible bends. Dr. Kim? You don't recognize me, do you? You attempted to cut off my head. I have something you want. Leave my family alone. It's me you want. Actually, no. You have a nasty habit of not staying dead. I'm guessing your offspring are not so lucky. Now as you surmise, I could kill everyone in this sad diner easily unless I get what I want. Which is? The prism on your right hand. Calvin, you watch movies, right? You know the rules. Come alone. If you alert the authorities or let your overprotective father interfere, they all die. Dropping you the pin now with the location. Well, hurry. Because when these two stop chatting, I make my move. Dr. Kim. Here's your phone back. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hold you hostage. Dad, we can't risk it. You can't go. - This isn't an obvious trap, son. - Yeah, of course. But you can't go. You heard him. You'd do the same thing if it was me held hostage. Hey. Hold on a second. Get off your bike. Turn your back to me. Look. It's gonna hurt a little bit. It's gonna help me track you. It better. Yeah. In the back of the van you'll find handcuffs. You know what to do. We got him.
