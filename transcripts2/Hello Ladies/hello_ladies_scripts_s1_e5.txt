 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if I need more, I just let the property manager know And he'll rustle some up from the basement. It's like he says, "chairs when you need 'em, not when you don't." Right. Yeah, look at that. And they've got the bed sort of in the living room. Yeah, it kinda has that new york loft feel. I suppose so. You don't tend to see a bed that close to a kitchen, Do you, normally? It's so convenient. I love that. - Breakfast in bed. - And dinner. I, uh... I'll eat dinner in there, too. That's the dream.

It's an absolute dynamite... Jessica, look at this. You're the first person to receive an official invite To my pool party of the century. - Gonna party like it's 1999. - Yep. "you are cordially invited to an exclusive pool party in the hollywood hills." - Yes, you are. - Well, technically, this is not the hills. You should put "the base of the hills." This is the hills, all right? You can see the h of the hollywood sign from here. Yeah, if you stand on the roof. Why are you trying to crap on this? You know I've always wanted to be known as the guy Who throws the best parties in la. The best parties that are byob. - All night long. - All night long. - Till the break of dawn. - Till the early morn. Till the early morn. People are gonna be talking about this for years to come, you know what I mean? They're gonna be like, "were you at the first ever pritch party? It was... I heard it was cool, it was, like, epic." - "I heard it was cool and epic." - "Epic. There was, like, a girl who just stripped off naked And just jumped in the pool and people were like, 'what?'" "she slipped, cracked her head. - There was, like, blood everywhere." - No, no, no, no. - "so crazy." - No, no, no. Actually, put up a sign that says, "no running by the pool" because that could be dangerous. Can you invite, like, um, 20 people? No, I'm not gonna invite a bunch of my girlfriends over - Just so you can hit on them. - That's not what it's about. You can invite your dude friends, if you want, As long as they are hip and trendy. Ethnic would be great, too, 'cause I feel like we need more diversity. Yeah, that'd be good. Can you drive me to the soup kitchen, please? Can you invite 20 people to the party? No, I'm not doing that. Well, then, good luck getting to the kitchen. - Ooh. - Burn. - It's a burn, baby. - While we're partying. Party, party. Organizing a party. - Too low, too low. - Ow! - Watch your head. - Got it, got it, yeah. Hi, ron. How ya doing? There you go. Hello, jackie. - There you go. - Thank you. Hi. You're new here, aren't you? My name's jessica. What's your name? - It's heaven. - Oh, heaven. - That's a very pretty name. - Thanks. Bye, guys. Hello again. Do you have a place to sleep? No. I know you don't know me, But if you need a bed, I have an air mattress. When you're photographing the party, Stylistically, I'm thinking reportage. How do you feel about black and white? I don't mind black and white Providing it's not pretentious. - Preaching to the choir. - This is glenn. Hey, glenn, it's stuart on speakerphone With my assistant, rory. Who? - Rory? - No, who are you? Stuart. Pritchard. - Chicken wings? - Chicken wings. What's going on, buddy? I'll tell you what's up, mate. I am having, at the weekend, an epic pool party. It's gonna be a sort of playboy mansion vibe. Who'd you hire for bartenders? I don't know. I'm not really thinking bartenders. I was thinking just keep it sort of DIY, Bring your own alcohol. You know, like most of the hip parties are doing now. No, you should use runway waiters. Smoking hot models serving drinks. My buddy runs the place. Do you think I could get a discount? - I don't think so. - No? I'm just gonna go into conference. What do you think of that? I like it, I just don't want to treat the models like they're objects. - Definitely not. No, no, no. - Dehumanize, you know what I mean? No, no, no. Not at all, not at all, not at all. But hire the sexiest one you can find. You got it. Glenn, it's Pritch, I'm back. Listen, mate, could you invite the sort of people That you'd expect to see on, say, a yacht party thrown by p. Diddy? But, like, when he was relevant? 'cause I'm gonna be pretty fixed for nerds. Sure. Glenn, I'm gonna have to call you back, mate, 'cause, um... There's a vagrant in my backyard. Go away. This is private property. You're not welcome here. This is called a mobile phone. I will call the police. Okay, relax, tough guy. She's with me. Do you wanna just go up to my guesthouse? Hey, angelina jolie. A little word here. What's going on? - Who's this? - She's just my friend. - Just your friend? Really? - Yeah, mm-hmm. Did you meet her at the soup kitchen? She has nowhere else to go. What, you invited her? She's not staying. - Well... - What are you, a maniac? She's probably a crackhead or a hooker or something. No, she's not. She is a very sweet girl who just needs... - Really? - Yes, she is. She just needs someone to be kind to her For once in her life. Haven't you ever felt the need To help someone less fortunate than you? Yes, it's why I let you live in my guesthouse. Oh, come on. I really want to help this girl. - Do you? - Yes. All right, well, she can stay. But you'd better invite at least 20 cool people to my party. Fine. Hiya. Hi, uh... I brought you some rosé Just to say sorry again for what happened at Margot's dinner. Thank you. That's very nice. I feel like maybe I should apologize To some of the other people that were at the dinner? I don't know if you've got their numbers. I could give them a call. Margot, your boyfriend, the black guy... - Armand. - Armand. Um, and I feel like there was... was there a blonde lady, Attractive, who showed up at the end? Kimberly, yes. She's one of my models. Is she a model? Hello? - Hi, is that kimberly? - This is her. - Hi, this is stuart. - Who? Stuart Pritchard. I'm a dear friend of Andy's. We met very briefly at Margot's dinner. Oh, yeah, the very, very tall man. The tall guy, yeah. That's a good memory, good memory. Sorry I had to take off early that night. I actually volunteer at a soup kitchen, so... - Are you a chef? - I'm not a chef, no. Um, although cooking is one of my passions. I also like theater and socializing with friends. I actually make my money owning and operating A successful web design business. Oh, hey, mention that we're making big strides in CSS framework integration. Shh. We're actually currently making big strides In CSS framework integration. Oh, that's nice. Listen, I don't know what you're doing Saturday, But I am having an epic pool party in the hills. I love parties. I went to this insane party last night. The dj was amazing. You should hire him. He played the best dubstep. This is weird 'cause you could literally Be describing my party back to me. Write down "drubstep." I love "drubstep." So, do you think you might be able to make it to the party? Um, yeah. Can I bring a few people? Yeah, no, of course, yeah. Why don't I put you down for, say, you know, plus 30? Okay, sounds good. See ya, bye. Bye. Oh, bit of bad news. - She's coming. - Oh. Put that in the bank savings. - Put that in the bank. - For savings. And see the interest accumulate. Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching. Oh, yes. Oh, you have to hire a dj asap. Done. Now, for cleanup, Do we want regular maids or fantasy french maids? Oui, oui. We don't need maids. You'll do the cleanup. Earth to stuart, we need cleaners. If only half the people come we've invited, We'll have, like, 250 people in here. This place is gonna be decimated. You know what I suddenly realized? Why am I selfishly having a party at my place To celebrate nothing When we should be having a party here To celebrate your beautiful new home? Yeah, I don't know. This is gonna be the party of the century. Honestly. We can just rent out the pool downstairs. We're gonna have the super cool dudes here. We're gonna have the beautiful women. Yeah, no, I can't be hanging out With beautiful women every night. I mean, what's marion gonna say? This is what you want. You want marion worrying about this. We'll take some pictures. We'll put them on facebook. - Marion will be all jealous. - Jealous, she'll be begging for you back. Yeah, you know, but a party takes so much organization. Don't worry about it. I got my best man on it. I got it. I've been reading a lot of books on parties. - And I got a spreadsheet. - I don't know. - Come on. - Please? Come on, wade. - I'll do it. - He's in! Yeah, party committee! - Party committee! - The party committee! - In full effect. - Yeah. - And I got illegal fireworks. - Fireworks. He's got fireworks. - No fireworks. - No fireworks. We're not doing fireworks. Come on. How long have you lived here? Uh, about a year and a half. This place seems small for someone your age. You don't even have a kitchen. Oh, no, I have a kitchen. Look. Ta-da. That's not a kitchen. That's a microwave behind a sheet. Oh, well, I don't really... I don't cook that much. Do you have any weed or pills? Why do you need drugs? I just need something to take the edge off. Take the edge off of what? You're not really doing anything. Hey, how about we sit together And work on your resume? Nah, I don't wanna do that. You know, I could help you get a job, if you'd let me. You sound like my fucking mother. Can you turn that shitty music off? No, this is... this is beautiful music, And it inspires me. Well, I'm trying to take a nap. Okay, sure, yeah. We'll just... That's a lot of booze. 'course it is, mate. Gonna be a lot of people here. Here he is, beat master general. Keeping the beats fresh, yeah? If you've got any white label stuff or demos, Don't be afraid to throw them in. You know, that guy sometimes plays outside vegas. - No. - Yeah, at a little club. - Hey, what is this? - What is this, indeed. The vip section, all right? You can only get in here if you've got one of these bracelets. - Oh. - Take a bunch. And we're only giving these out to the cream of the crop. People with the "it" factor. I'm talking actresses, models, natch. Musicians, any kind of local businessmen. - Cool. - Better sign this. What's going on here? I booked the pool. Oi, kid. Who's in charge here? Hello. Who organized this little shindig? Is there anybody in there? Are you a little bit simple? You just roam the land unsupervised? - Can I help you? - Possibly, yeah. I actually booked the pool from 3:00. It's now 3:15 - And you've got the young 'uns at play. - Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah. The only problem is that I'm having quite a "adults only" party. And I'm just concerned about the kids Seeing some of the shit that's gonna go down. I don't see any guests. You don't see any guests at the moment, no. You don't at the moment, but they are on the way, And we are talking actresses, we're talking models, We're talking actors and musicians, So, as I say, it could be a little bit x-rated, - If you catch my drift. - Oh, I do. I promise we'll get out when your guests arrive. - How's that? - Okay, that seems reasonable. - Good? Okay. All right. - All right. She is being completely unreasonable And refusing to get out of the pool. What are the rules, you know what I mean? - Right. - Like, if we don't have a system in place, - Society collapses, right? - Uh-huh, sure. You know what I mean? And I don't know If there's a way you could maybe have a word with her. Yeah, I could chat with her. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, no, I don't blame you at all, But could you not let anyone into the party Who doesn't have one of these official invites? - Okay. - All right? So unless they're carrying one of those, Please just don't let them in. You guys put on sunblock? Yeah, I put on two layers. Pardon me, excuse me. Can I have a quick word? Yeah, yeah. - Who's this lot? - What? They're other residents. They're not really the sort of people we're after, mate, at this party. They're sort of lowering the tone a bit. What... no, they're good guys. I mean, Barry's also separated. Clive's a widower. A widower? I don't want him droning on to some model about his dead wife. He never talks about her. No one does. You should check with me before... - Oi. - Yeah? - Hello. - Hi. - How's it going? - Good. Who the fuck are you? I'm from runway waiters. Of course you are. - Rory? - Yeah? This gentleman says he's from runway waiters. Yep, you asked me to hire someone. Yes, I did. I asked you to hire someone, yeah. And what made you think that I'd want a man, not a woman? You didn't specify a gender. Why would I want a better-looking bloke than me here? Because he's the eye candy! Eye candy for who? We should be the eye candy. For everybody. Are you kidding? Look at this guy. He's like a slice of heaven. Yeah, he's a good-looking blo... I don't want... delete that. I don't want a picture of him. I don't want a picture of me with him. And you, put a bloody shirt on. Come on. I think I have one in my car. What do you mean, you think you have one... Who comes out without a shirt? Thanks for putting the pants on. That was nice of you. Can you stop doing that, please? You need to relax. You're so uptight. What? Sorry. You live here, do ya? Yeah? Wade invite ya? Good, welcome. - Let me get you guys. - Don't take a... I don't want a picture with them. - Just delete that. - Okay, my bad. Have you had any emails or anything? Texts?
