 Seriously, we're going to have to tell them at some point. Er no, we're going to have to tell them at no point. What? The first time we've ever had girlfriends at the same time? Do you know how happy mum will be? Yes, the happiest she's ever been in her entire life. Exactly. And it will be hell. It won't be hell. It will be hell, won't it? Total hell. Let's definitely not tell them. Yuck. What's that smell? Sewers. Oh. Um, thanks.

 You're welcome. Scared of the man? Petrified. And there it is. Dad's massive, stupid caravan. It's absolutely disgusting. It's a dustbin on wheels. Dustbin on bricks. Hello, bambinos. Hi. Hello, Dad. Well, what do you think? Er, were you wearing a blindfold when you bought that? What? Or were you just in a coma? Pillock. Why the hell did you buy a caravan? I told you, I went in one when I was a boy, and... Whoa. That's not dangerous.

 Yeah, "Safety last", eh, Dad? Idiots. Well, come in then. Really? Say your prayers. Well? And if you thought it looked nice on the outside... What a dump. What? It's fabulous. Yes, it's a fabulous shithole. It's not a shithole. Ow. Now, listen, I need your help. Psychological help, or...? How am I going to get that mother of yours to set foot in my caravan? Er, have you tried chloroform? She hates this bloody thing. And might that be because you bought this shithole behind her back? It's not a shithole. Well, OK, it needs a bit of work. Or a bit of dynamite. So? So, what? Are you going to help me, then? What? Help you make mum like your horrible caravan? Yes. BOTH: No. Why not? Because it's a shithole. Jesus. Yeah, that needs adjusting. You need adjusting. Goodbye. Now wait... Now, how about we all have dinner in here tonight? Sure, Dad. Sure. It'll be lovely. All four of us, the whole family, eating together. Dying together. Look, it's got everything, a kitchen. Hideous. A dining area. Hideous. Toilet. That's just terrifying. OK, then , just look at what I made for your mum. Boys... I thought you were in here. Hi. Hi, Mum. Hello, my sweet, are you coming inside? You know the answer, Martin. Boys... But you haven't even given it a chance. Come on, Jackie, you don't know what you're missing. Any number of diseases. Ow. OK, out of that shithole. Certainly. It's not a shithole. And make sure you wash your hands. What? They don't need to wash their hands. Er, we do need to wash our hands. Um, and dinner's nearly ready. Are you coming inside or what? Well, actually, Jackie, the boys said that they'd really like to have dinner in the caravan. Yes, that is exactly what we said. Martin, for the 800th time, we are not having dinner in your... ..murder van, all right? All right. God. See you, Dad. Yeha, enjoy your murdering. He wants us to have dinner in that?! Certain death. Can you believe your stupid dad bought a caravan? Not just any caravan. That caravan. All week it's been festering in our drive. Boys, where can we get a crushing machine? You know he wanted to take me on holiday in that thing? On holiday? What? So you can both plummet off a cliff? Hands. It's funny, I haven't stepped inside it once yet, and it's been sending him quite mad. We hadn't noticed. What's with the water? Oh, cos they've been digging up the silly road. Looking for dad's victims? Yes, I'm really enjoying annoying your father at the moment. And long may it continue, Mother. Hm, I'm really enjoying it. Er, is that, gin? Sorry. I must just go for a wee. Mum? She's drinking gin. That's what she drinks when she's... ..depressed. We have to tell her our news. No way. Adam. Boys. Ugh. God, Dad, what are you doing? Shhh. Where's your mother? What? Where is she? Um, in the loo. What do you want? Just gone in the loo? Or been in there a while? Does it matter? Has your brain fallen out of your head tonight? Just answer the sodding question. Um, she's been in the loo for, precisely 17 seconds. Great. Right, this is the plan. The plan? You take the soup, follow me out through the side door, all the way up to the caravan. What? Dinner in the caravan. Remember? Erm, no, we don't remember. No, we do remember, we said we definitely do not want to have dinner in your disgusting caravan. God, then I'll have to get the bloody soup myself then, won't I? Thanks for nothing. Martin? What are you doing with my soup? Huh? Boys, quick. You little git. What are you doing? Dad thinks he's in a prison movie or something. Were you stealing my soup? No. Yes, you were. Shut up. And have a guess where he was taking it. Right, I'm having that, thank you. But Jackie, I've made it all nice in there. What? You mean you've emptied the chemical toilet? Actually, I may need a hand with that thing, cos the unit's jammed and it's brimming with human waste. OK, maybe you shouldn't have dinner with us tonight. What? Er, Mum? Shut up, boys. Yes, maybe you should eat all on your own. But, Jackie. In your shithole. It's not a shithole! Right then. Dinner for three? This is fun, isn't it? The three of us having dinner, mummy and her boys. Uh-huh. What? Well, I mean, obviously this is great fun. Great fun. And not at all like we suddenly don't have a dad any more. Very good. Even though we always set a place for him at the table. To remind us of the better times. Thank you, boys. I hope he's all right in there. Poor dad. Poor dad? Right. We'll see if he's all right in there, shall we? Jackie to Martin. BOTH: What is that? Your dad's stupid thing for when he's in his stupid, crapmobile. Martin, it's Jackie, are you all right in there? It's a good system. Martin to Jackie, how many times do I have to tell you? It's "Are you all right in there OVER?" He's all right in there. I'm sorry, but it's been like this all week. Every night he's had his dinner out there, and I've had my dinner in here. It's been really hard. I've been really lonely. Adam's got a girlfriend. You shit. Ow. What? Jonny's got a girlfriend. Huh? You've both got girlfriends? BOTH: Yes. At the same time? BOTH: Yes. Oh, my God, thank you! Please. Thank you. Mum. Oh, I am so excited. Martin? Uh. Martin. Come inside right now. Something incredible's just happened. Seriously? Boys, you don't know how happy you've just made your mother. We do. Martin to Jackie, it's "Something incredible's just happened OVER!" God. Where are you going? Martin, bloody come in here right now. Mum?! The neighbours? Screw the neighbours. Oh, we are going to celebrate tonight. Are we? And I am going to hear everything, about everything. DOOR BELL RINGS Coming! Right, stay there. Stay there. Oooooh. Two weddings. Hell. Total. Martin, the boys have... Hello, Jackie. Oh, it's you. The boys have what, Jackie? Cholera? Sorry? Um, terrible time, Jim. What do you want? Martin? No, I just wanted you to know that I've finally come up with a name. A name? Yes, Jackie, well, I couldn't keep calling her Wilson, so, I've come up with a completely different name for her. Oh, right. And, what is it? Milson. Milson? Milson. Hi, Jim. Hello, boys. Um. Jim's got a completely new name for his dog. It's Milson. Well, that is a completely new name. Right, well erm, thank you, Jim. Martin? Also, I wondered if you'd noticed a strange sort of eggy smell outside? Eggy smell? Yes. Very eggy. Oh, yeah, well that'll just be the water people. The Water People? Where? Um, in the road, Jim, you know, the people doing the sewers? The sewers. MARTIN: So I'm allowed in now, am I? Uh. Been in your special little house, have you, Martin? What? Oh, that's right. I've always wanted to go in one of those. Well, you're welcome any time, Jim. Am I? Stupid bumhole. So is that all, Jim? Yes, of course, Jackie. Bye all. Come on, Milson. Good girl. Um, goodbye, Jim. Goodnight. My God. Milson? Martin, the boys have some incredible news. Go on, tell your dad. Adam's got three weeks to live. Ow. That is a horrible thing to say. Three weeks? Can't he make it three days? Argh, Jackie. God. Both the boys have got girlfriends. Really? These two buggers have both got females? Uhhh. Yeah, dad, we've both got "females". Isn't that amazing? Ooh, what are their names? BOTH: Lucy. Sorry? They're both called Lucy. Both of your girlfriends are called Lucy? Yeah, it's quite annoying actually. Very annoying. OK, well, we'll call your Lucy, Lucy one and your Lucy, Lucy two. Great idea, Mum. Er, why's my girlfriend number two? Cos she's second best, obviously. Ow. Well, aren't you going to say anything, Martin? What? Oh, yes... ..well done. Well done? Both of your sons have got girlfriends and that's all you can say? It's OK, mum. It's not OK. Do you know how many years I've been waiting for this bloody moment? You're supposed to be their father. Say something proper to your sons. OK, boys... BOTH: Yes? ..always wear a sheath. Ahhh, your girlfriends sound so nice. Yes, please ask lots more questions about them. Like another 100,000. Stop it. Can we have the rest of our dinner now? Come on, photos? Photos? Really? Come on. Uhhh. Ooh, lovely hair. Yup. Ooh, lovely smile. Mine's definitely the fittest. The shittest. Dad? Pissface. Who do you think's the fittest? Oh, how can you say such a thing. The fittest? How would I know? Have you tried racing them against each other? Huh? Fantastic celebration. Well, if you really want to celebrate, why don't we all go in my caravan? Or why don't we not? In fact, if you and your "ladies" ever want to use the caravan for a bit of, you know... "Ar-ar-ar-ah. Ar--ar-ar-ar-ar-ah." Oh, my God. Just ask. You're revolting. You know that? Oh, yes. Right, go in there and take the chicken into the dining room, will you? Ar-ar-ar-ah. Ar--ar-ar-ar-ar-ah. OK. Nazi interrogation over? All right. Yes. Bring on the chicken. Chicken time. Ahhh, I can't wait to meet your lovely girls. Sorry? Huh? Well, you want them to meet mummy, don't you? Right. Thank you for ruining my celebration. Your celebration? OK, obviously mum and dad are never meeting our girlfriends. Obviously. Boys? Boys? Mum? What's happened? He's taken the chicken. This is ridiculous. Piss off. How's he got his top off already? STATIC FEEDBACK Martin, come out with the chicken this second. It's, "Martin, come out with the chicken this second, OVER." How many bleeding times? Jonny! Bloody sods! Give us the chicken! Now! Get off! Dad! OK, you can have the chicken, you can all have the chicken, if you eat it in here. What? Your mum thinks it's so horrible in my caravan, does she? Well, just wait till she sees what I've done for her. There, see that? "Martin and Jackie." Yes, very nice, dad. Can we have the chicken now? And if I press this button... THEY SCREAM Agh! Now! Sorry, Dad. Oi! I've got the chicken! I've got the chicken! Quickly! SHE LAUGHS Give it back, you bastards. Oh, Bobbles, my heroes. KNOCKS ON DOOR Give me that chicken! Go away! He needs locking up. KNOCKS ON DOOR Right. Oh, no, the side door. CRASH Ow. Wait. Huh? GRUNTING Ahhh, of course. Hello, Martin. Well, help me, then. Certainly, darling, let me just move this nice, soft chair out of your way. Oh, Jackie. Help me for God's sake. Uh, don't you mean, "Help me for God's sake, over?" Why don't you sit down, boys? Thank you, mother. You bloody, bleeding...! HE SHOUTS, THUDS, HE GROANS Agh. I think I've broken my skull. You are getting scraps tonight. Do you hear me? Scraps! Yes. Our poor girlfriends, missing all this. Hello, all. God, Jim! Christ! THEY SHOUT Jim? Completely flooded? Yes, Jackie, my house is completely flooded. With, what's the word? Um, water? Excrement. Excrement? Excrement? Apparently a sewerage pipe got redirected into my house. Th-that's why my shoes are all... Eeh, ooh... And, uh... And then the water people told me I had to leave while they tried to fix it. And now I've got nowhere to go. Oh, God. Sorry, Jim, we'd love to invite you in, but we're sort of celebrating tonight. No more cholera? What?! Sorry? Um, it's all right, Jackie. I wasn't going to ask if I could come in. Good. Oh. No, I just wondered if maybe I could have a little piece of chicken to eat. Er, OK. And maybe if I could have it in the... ..special little house. MUSIC: 1901 by Phoenix Oof. Nice bone and gristle, Martin? Ooh. Jim to Martin on the talkie walkie, over. Not again.

Um, sorry, dad I don't actually know if my girlfriend likes caravans. Yeah, funny, I don't really know either. You don't know if they like caravans? What the hell do you talk about? Not caravans, I hope. I mean, I can ask if you'd like me to. I would, actually. "Do you like caravans?" I'll ask as well, just texting Lucy One, the best Lucy.
