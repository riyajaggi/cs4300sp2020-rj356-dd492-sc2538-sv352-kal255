 Women in Love (2011): Season 1, Episode 1 - Episode #1.1 - full transcript 
 In pre-Great War Nottingham Gudrun Brangwen,a budding artist,prepares to return to Robert,her married lover,in London,to the disapproval of her school-teacher sister Ursula,though she is hardly in a position to take the moral high ground,recovering from a miscarriage,a consequence of her affair with dumb army officer Anton Skrebensky. Ursula tells Anna,her mother,she is too passionate for a conventional relationship and gets dumped by Anton,as does Gudrun by Robert,in both cases after a day by the sea. Anna's passion is starting to fade but is rekindled towards her husband Will after she has sent him out to have sex with another woman. Closet gay school inspector Rupert Birkin flees his number one admirer Hermione Roddice whilst lusting after mine owner's son Gerald Crich. He also comes on to a soldier and gets beaten up for his pains. At Gerald's lavish birthday party his sister Diana drowns,dragging down with her the man who tried to save her. A distraught Gerald turns to a local girl for sex.

 [PANTING] [HORSES NEIGHING] [GRUNTS] [HORSE SNORTING] [GROANS] Yes, we are swept up in a sea of scientific and technical innovation. The automobile, the electric light, the aeroplane, the x-ray. On all sides, our genius cries out and seems to underline Mr Darwin's assertion that we are,

 indeed, the cleverest of an evolutionary bunch. Yet I would say to him, as I say to all those in this House, look to the workings of a time piece, each ratchet and spring and cog and lever, all coming together in one sublime whole. And tell me if you think that could happen by accident? Of course not. There is always design in brilliance. And purpose, too. And in knowing that, we know that in each new discovery we daily make, we witness no more or less than the work of the greatest creator of all, God Himself! The Bible was given to us for a reason, as the instruction manual for our own intricate mechanism.

 For when all is said and done and we lie inert on the mortician's slab, no matter the x-rays that will reveal our hidden bones, it is our souls that will then require attention! MAN: Hear, hear. [ALL APPLAUDING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] That was magnificent! You were like a God! Hermione, you romanticise everything. You were! I merely describe what I saw, a God. And as your priestess, I knew I must hurry across to serve you. Let me get you a drink. Thank you. [CHILDREN CHATTERING] [BABY CRYING] BILLY: Mum? Mum! She keeps grizzling. I've give her some water but... I told Conk I'd see him at 3:00. Go on then, go on. [SHUSHING] [CHILDREN LAUGHING] Quiet, you two! Your sister... [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] -[EXCLAIMS] -[LAUGHS] Are you serious? I thought it would cheer you up. That? Well, inspire you, then. Father only put this thing in... Gudrun. I don't need any musical palliatives. Really. I'm quite well. Good. I'm glad you are. I'm going back to London. What? I have to. I've fallen behind in my course. And there's a gallery that wants to see some of my work. Gudrun, do me the courtesy. You're going back for your trip after all, aren't you? It's none of your business. And I don't want to talk about it. Then why did you mention it when you first came home? I beg your pardon? It was the first thing you said to me, your great adventure with your artist friend. I rather thought you were going to tell father over the dinner table. Oh, don't be ridiculous. He's a married man. His marriage is over. In everything... Except actuality. I'm sorry. I don't... It's concern for you. You know that. If other people found out. I don't care what other people think. Well, perhaps you should. Since we live in a world full of other people. Oh, God! Even ill you manage to sound so superior. I don't want you to be hurt. I won't be hurt! The world's changed, Ursula. It's grown up. And I'm a modern woman in it. More than you are in fact, -who's chosen to stay here. -Prune. No. I refuse to dip only in the stagnant, fetid pool that gathers in my own back yard. That's the path to disaster. -Not my way. -Enough! [SNIFFLES] You've said enough. I've got my just deserts. That's not what I meant. Yes, it is. I'm glad I lost the baby. I should have loved it, I'm sure, when it was born. But really, I'm glad, that mother will no longer be able to look over at me, sitting in the parlour while I dangle the infant on my knee and think, "At last she's made something of herself." [BOTH CHUCKLE] Live your life, Prune, as you see fit. But it's yours. Remember that. Men cannot define you. I don't... Yes, you do! Because no matter how modern you are, how much variety you enjoy, you still orbit them, make them the light by which you are illuminated. And if you continue on that track, Prune, then I fear that for all your freedoms, you might as well climb into this bed with me now. [DOOR CLOSING] [SOBBING] Hey! -Bye. -Bye, love. Oh! Hang on. Hang on! There you go. You ready, then? Yes. Gudrun. What? Your sister, is she all right? She says she's much better. Oh. Right. Good. I'll just fetch my valise. It's a bag. Bad do, Anna. Bad bloody do all round. Set? Oh! WILL: It's thick. The snow. ANNA: My dad said the mummers might come by later. Carol us under the window. WILL: That would be nice. ANNA: They probably won't. Because of the snow. WILL: I've locked it. GUDRUN: Well, you wouldn't want anyone to steal it, would you? Sherbet lemons. They've opened a kiosk. Do you want one? Here, have the bag. Go on. I needed to speak to you, actually. Yes? You know well enough. This crowd in London that you hang about with. I most certainly do not "hang about" with anyone. Don't split hairs, you know what I mean. Well, I'm a fine artist, Father. I'm living and studying in one of the world's great capitols. I mix with people that you cannot understand. Then help me! Help me understand them. I want to. I just... Otherwise... I think things. Well, don't. I'm getting on splendidly. Really. [WHISTLE BLOWING] Why are you doing this? You're a good girl, Gudrun. [TRAIN HORN BLOWING] [TRAIN APPROACHING] [DOOR OPENING] BIRKIN: Oh, bugger. [GRUNTS] Oh, sorry. Ah, Miss Brangwen. Mr Birkin. What a nice surprise. I didn't know you were back. No. No, no. No indeed. It's a flying visit. A birthday party. Gerald Crich. Do you know him? No, no. I know of him, obviously. All the Crich's. We've never met. Oh, he's a splendid fellow. I ran into him in Switzerland over Easter. I was visiting a friend, a mutual friend as it turned out. Since then we've rather become an item. I should introduce you. That would be nice. And how are you? I heard you had been unwell. -Influenza. But... -Oh. You still look a little pale. You don't think that... No, I'm fine. Really. I'm over the worst. Sorry. I'm a dreadful hypochondriac. It's part of a general predisposition to naval gaze rather too much, I think. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Gerald says I should be a character in a novel. Which is interesting seeing, as to my knowledge, he has never actually read one, but essentially, he's right. I should. One of those gloomy Russian affairs. Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky. Where I could spend 400 pages being ill and bemoaning my inability to fit in with the world. Have you come to practise? I assume you'll be giving us one of your thunderous readings this Sunday? Oh. No. No, no. I'm not sure I'll be around. I'm just returning these, actually. I really have had them a lifetime. It suddenly occurred to me that I... Would you like a lift? Back to Beldover? I've borrowed a gig. I could quite easily run you. Or were you having... Having a moment? [LAUGHS] It's good to see you, of all people. It's been a little while. Yes. Yes. I did mean to write. Oh, you've been busy. I understand. I thought perhaps you might have visited the school or... How is Miss Roddice, by the way? Oh, she's... She's very well. Thank you. I'll tell her we bumped into each other. You are still in regular contact, then? Uh... Yes, you know, on and off. And what of Mr Skrebensky? I imagine, he's... I wouldn't know. He's been posted abroad. We are definitely off. I beg your pardon. I'm being rather forceful... No, not at all. No. You're being refreshingly honest, as you always are. Ursula, where have you been? Mr Brangwen. Mr Birkin. Your mother's been having kittens fretting where you'd gone off. You shouldn't even be out. You should be in bed still, not striding hither and yon. Is that yours? Sorry. Well, I just see you have the gauntlets. The motorcycle is mine, Mr Birkin. I apologise. Would you like to touch it? -May I? -Yeah. Good Lord! Aye! It's the way forward. Them, smell of glue in their nostrils, every one of them, if they've any sense. Anyway, I'll thank you for bringing my daughter back. I was going to ask Mr Birkin if he'd like to come in, Father. Would that be all right? Uh... No. I don't think so, not today. I mean, uh, Billy's not very well, and Cassie, she's sick and all. It's like a plague house, really. I quite understand. Honestly. Gerald's promised me a special supper, so I shouldn't be too late back, anyway. But, please, do keep in contact. I will. Good day. BIRKIN: Walk on. Father? You've got a visitor. I've no doubt you'd rather keep it private. URSULA: Anton. Ursula! I tried wiring. But it's all still in its infancy over there. And I drafted a letter, but I couldn't express my thoughts exactly. Then why have you come? Because I received your letter. And it affected me greatly. I knew I must see you. The child is gone. Yes, I know. Mother. She told me only the barest of details. Horses in a field, bolted. It is gone! And I am sorry for you. For us, it would have been wonderful. But we will try again. I can't believe I can say that. Because, after you left me, I couldn't imagine ever even speaking to you again. I felt most slighted. Yes. And I am sorry. I was. When I read what you wrote, I knew you felt remorse and... I cannot remember what I said. You said there were things you had imagined you could not have with me. A different kind of love. But you saw that was all illusory at last. Yes. And you wanted me. You wanted what you could have. Well, you can, Ursula. And you must have this back. I should go now. It's shock enough, my turning up, unannounced. I'll call tomorrow in the afternoon. Yes. [BOTH PANTING] [URSULA LAUGHS] SKREBENSKY: Lots of the men at the barracks have lovers. Most, in fact. Do they? They're always mentioning some amazing fine woman or other. And most dash off to London the moment they finish their work. What for? To see them! There's one fellow who has a suitcase always at the ready, and the moment he is at liberty, he whips off his spurs and runs straight to the train. It must be quite a welcome which awaits him. I think it is. Don't you like me tonight? We kissed. SKREBENSKY: Like children! I want to kiss properly. See? Not so bad. [BOTH CHUCKLE] [URSULA MOANING] [LAUGHS] There you are. Anton Skrebensky. I thought we should not see him again. Mother, please. It was an observation. I wasn't... He told me that you wrote of me in asking for his forgiveness. You wrote that since you had become pregnant, you saw me suddenly in a new and true light. That I was radically true having your father and my children and my place here under the sun. And what was enough for me must surely be enough for you. Is that what you said? I must have, if that is what he remembers. What of it? Be careful what you wish for. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [WHISPERS] Anna. I'm tired. And I'm awake. Why must you. Because I must! [ANNA SIGHS] You're sheathed over. What? You don't need me. You're self sufficient, you are. You belong elsewhere. You don't belong with me. I am your wife. In name you are, but not in the dark. Ooh! Bugger, bugger, bugger. BIRKIN: Everything all right? What do you think? No. Clearly. You need to be careful with those hammers. Do you practise? You're like something from The Varieties. I'm merely trying to help. Then grab a rope. Gosh. GERALD: Gosh? You did give me the impression you wanted the party to happen modestly, if at all. I do. It's father. When he sets his mind to something, he doesn't bother with half measures. Your father? Oh, I mentioned some improvements to the collieries. He wants me to get on with it. Quid pro quo. His side of the bargain. You know what would be really helpful, would be if you pulled on that rope, thus lifting your edge of the tent. [CHUCKLES] Oh, would you like gloves? If it's not too much trouble. [GERALD CHUCKLES] Couldn't you get the men to do it? Of course I could. Except this is the only bit of the whole event I'll actually enjoy. You really are the thing itself. I tell all of my friends that, in education. Generally! I know a man who is the spirit of the age. I'm putting up a tent, Rupert. It's an ethos, you clod! Energy, speed. What about all the modernising at the pits? The electricity? GERALD: Anyone would have done that. No. It's you. Like an exploding shell shot from a gun which fragments into a million different pieces. He evolves new systems, new beliefs even. Ah! You can stop there. I know where you're going now. All that futurist gumph, the pointy pictures. Do you know, I said to one of the buttys the other day, "I've never been led round an art gallery to the point of "actual sickness, until you took me. "And not a single breast." I mean, normally, there is at least that to fall back on. Not with your friends. I am an industrialist! I like to get things done. There's an end to it. Anyway, should you even be saying that sort of stuff? New beliefs and get you into terrible trouble, upstairs, won't it? I was merely observing the way you are, Gerald. I keep my own beliefs quite separate. GERALD: Abby. Don't you just like to get things done... Oh, for goodness sake, I was smiling. That's all. Of course. Just here on the left, please. How much is that? DRIVER: One and six, please, love. Thank you. Thank you. HALLIDAY: Gudrun! MAXIM: She's back! All hail the Queen. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] GUDRUN: You're too kind. HALLIDAY: See you, Percy. -Who's that? -Percy Lewis. Prefers Wyndham these days. -He knows of your paintings. -Well, I know of his. I would have liked to have talked to him. He's best friends with Edith Sitwell. I believe you'll bump into her? She's from up north. Well, I'm from the Midlands, Halliday. Hello! HALLIDAY: Freddy! Freddy Von Such and Such. Doesn't she have stacks of money? Edith Sitwell. I think she does. Money is nothing, Pussum. Class... Is everything! [ALL LAUGHING] More champagne! So, how was it? At home? It was terribly earnest, as always. I spoke to Tommy Craig earlier. He knows of your little adventure this weekend. Does anyone else? Anyone who cares to ask me. [CHUCKLES] You are splendid! I refuse to be bound by the weary sickness of pedantry and tradition. That I can drink to. But... But will you really do it? It's just a fuck. [CHUCKLES] You are magnificent. Am I? [SIGHS] [EXHALES] I'm old, Anna. What you on about? You're not yet 50. [SCOFFS] That's old. I'm died out from the hot life, that's for sure. They'll be all right, won't they? The girls, they'll be all right? [PEOPLE LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Oh, I thought you'd gone. I forgot something. You wouldn't have me beg, surely? I will, of course, if I must. [CHUCKLES] Darling, nothing excites me more than a man in extremis, but on this occasion, I must decline. I must reserve all my strength for tomorrow, after all. You have the strength of 10. Let me be the hors d'oeuvre. Really, I can't. [CHUCKLES] But Halliday said you were a good sport. What? He said you were a good sport. I heard what you said. Um... Talk to me next week, Freddy. I might be a little freer then. Or we'll see each other at your mother's party, won't we? We can talk then. What? I meant to mention. It's nothing personal, but she says the numbers will be wrong, apparently, if... I'm not even sure I'll go myself. Fine. Well, I'll see you in class, then. [PEOPLE LAUGHING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh! I was coming down. Oh. I thought you might prefer it up here. I will, now you've brought it. Thank you. Your father's motorcycle won't start. He's late for work. I said to him, "Don't get that with a horse. "Less it's dead, of course." When he sold the farm, I remember, I told him, "There's much to recommend this life, Will, over a town" "and you'll come to see it one day." Are you all right? He loves you very much, you know. Your father... Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother. [SOBS] Stop fussing. I'm not fussing. You're upset. You were upset yesterday after Anton's visit. What's going on, Mother? Please! He held you so close to the flame, so young. URSULA: What? Who did? You think I don't approve of how you live and... Well, it's true. What's happened now with you and Anton Skrebensky, I doubt I should've allowed myself to get in the same position. All this need for independence, too. Wanting to work and... That's not something I can understand either, but I'm not sour. We are not so different, Ursula, you and I. That's what I mean. And I realise it maybe isn't all your fault. How things have turned out. And, perhaps, if I had been less certain after we were married. With father? I knew where his love would go. And I knew, too, the dangers of making so young a heart swell. How a person receiving such devotion might grow, live their whole lives yearning for that same fierce passion and how that might, one day, cause that person to suffer, somehow. I knew all that and I did nothing. But I am not sour, I am sorry. [MOTORCYCLE STARTING] YOUNG URSULA: What about mother? WILL: She has got little Billy and your sister to look after. She'll not mind. URSULA: So why are we whispering? WILL: 'Cause we don't wanna wake her, do we? Ursula, it's gala day. Do you know how many gala days you get in a year? Few, my duck. Very few. Now, come on! Geronimo! [YELLS] Go on. Have a swing. -You know you want to. -No! But there's the thrill of the drop. Run out, let go and drop. I'm scared. Go! [SCREAMING] Ursula! Ursula? [GASPS] Come on. It's all right. It's all right. I have got you. Well done. You did it, didn't you? You swung in from that great high rope. There's a good girl. Fair now. I will win you a goldfish and we can go on the swing boats. Good girl. Hello, Robert. Gudrun. Are you ready? Yes. I was just looking at your work. It's Eadweard Muybridge. I merely photographed the photographs. All photography is theft, Robert. That's the point. And the more we writhe for the camera, the more the soul remains obscured. Another one of your paintings sold yesterday at the Serpentine. -Another? -Mmm. The painting of the street light. [EXCLAIMS IN DELIGHT] Were any of yours? [CHUCKLES] I'm not a real artist, Gudrun. That is why I teach. But I have my moments of optimism. Like anyone else. Now is one such moment. Our very own adventure. The Isle of Wight. [WHISTLE BLOWING] Et voila! The connection is at midday. The boat at 2:00. -I can't. -What? I can't do it. I'm sorry. [SIGHS] But... I thought I could. I want to. But I'm not like you. I'm a married man. But we have to go, Robert. We've announced it in our hearts... There, we have already made the commitment. We have to have our time away together, Robert. We are artists. It is our duty to rise above the crowd. I know my limitations, Gudrun. I'm a middle-aged man who plays at painting. But what am I? Actually? Someone who stands at the front of a classroom, in order to support a wife and two small children. Oh, very well, Robert. If you insist. But you can't leave it like this. Here. At least come away with me for an afternoon. We can go to Brighton, we can see the sea, and then we can return home this evening. [GUDRUN LAUGHS] Come on. URSULA: Look at Nottingham. Look at the lights. Aren't they an abomination? Polluting the dark. At the same time, they do help you to see. Well, they do though. It would be hell without them. I must go back tomorrow. My leave has expired. URSULA: Oh, Anton. You should have said. I would have arranged something special. Perhaps I have. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GROANS] No. No, it's fine. It's fine. [MOANING] What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing, it's fine. [GASPING] You are wrong, Mother! What's the matter? What is it, child? You think you have damaged me. What has happened with Anton is because of father and you are right. When I recall we did have some times. -And I have said... -No! Wait! I've always known. I felt rather than thought. And you are right, probably, about father, his role, but that is not why Anton and I... The problem is sex, Mother. Sex! Love! I broke with Anton because he did not feed that animal side of me that felt life. And I wrote to get back together because I was pregnant and I was scared. But now, with the baby gone, I was certain once more, I am meant to be free. To indulge my passion in this life. But it is not passion, Mother, which drives me on. It is lust. And insatiable desire. And that is what stood between me and Anton. It's the same thing. What? The passion that you talk of. For life and all that's out there. And the other thing? They are the same. We must keep ourselves warm, Ursula. We must. There is no shame in it. What happens between people. Between them as they love each other. And so we must keep the flame burning, crackling in the grate. Otherwise, we're cold on the earth, when soon enough we're gonna be cold beneath it. Do you see? You are lucky. You have felt the truth of it. That some do not or cannot, for whatever reason. Some choose to be cold. They choose the gone out world. Because it offers less danger, less shame, perhaps. But no one should choose it. Find love that burns your very soul. And know this that it will burn your body, too. And if it does not, then you're not in love. [VEHICLE APPROACHING] It's Mr Skrebensky. Good afternoon. It's my uncle's. I thought it would cheer Ursula up. So, where to? Southwell, I thought, or... Could we go to the sea? What? Would it get us to the coast? Of course. -WILL: Ursula! -[HORN HONKING] [GUDRUN LAUGHING] Gudrun! Oh, it really is a frightful drop. Please. Come. Come and see. Be careful. Come here! -Oh, my Lord! -Look! No, I don't like this at all. [LAUGHING] You laugh but one slip and you'll be over. -All snuffed out. -Good! We must pass beyond life, Robert. And a little way into death if we are ever to feel truly alive. You are so beautiful. Why are you with me? Because I can be. Feel that. What can you feel? Tell me. I feel happiness. First time in my life. Real happiness. You're a poet, as well as a painter. I am flesh and blood. That's why cliffs scare me. I would break if I fell. But you... You are eternal. So, you can look. Lunch in 10 minutes. Lovely. Thank you. And have you seen the book? On Mont Blanc. I am sure it'll remind you of the holiday. No. Um... You weren't terribly precise. Right at the top. Hmm. Why do you keep it up there? Don't you look at it very often? It is a book on mountaineering, Rupert. Gerald! Christ! [GERALD LAUGHS] It gets hard around the Thesauruses. They and I have a natural aversion to one another. Be careful. [EXCLAIMS] I'm fine. Never in doubt. [GRUNTS] Ta-ra! Rupert. Miss Roddice. Good afternoon. -Gerald. -Hermione. You are five hours early. I thought I might be able to assist in the preparations. And failing that, a chance to catch up with Mr Birkin on one of his ever rarer trips outside of Nottingham. Ooh, that reminds me. Are we going to try and take in the County game? We could still get back in time. I'm sure you have loads to tell me. Actually, it's rather unfortunate. If I had known you were coming early, I would have been able to, but as it is, I have some business to attend to. I meant to mention. It won't take too long. There is a tent I've got to finish putting up, actually. You don't fancy... You will not even fuck me. Your cock. -Would that excite you? -Hermione. [LAUGHS] You cannot fuck me! I know you can get aroused. You're not a real man. You're a boy. You want... Stop it. [LAUGHING] -It's happening! -Hermione. You needed words. I knew you needed words. I warn you. So will this man stand up in Church on Sunday and read the Gospel? You hypocrite! Is not marriage and union with a woman at the very heart of the Christian community? Rupert? Rupert? So even if you cannot do your duty by me as a man, you should come to me hard and ready as a disciple of Jesus. And if you cannot do that, what are you doing in the Church? WILL: Mmm. Mmm. Oh, lovely. Where are the children? Billy took them out. He was desperate. Gone over to Cossell. Will you go out later? Yeah, I might. Up the church. Practise a bit. -Why? -I wondered. It's a Saturday afternoon. It's your time. You do not want to be with me any more. -You what? -I understand. Hang on. You think you have not enough of me, and maybe you don't, except... Maybe, too, you don't make it good between us any more. You're not interested. What in God's name are you talking about, Anna? Would you like to have another woman? What? Would you? I can't believe... Why would you say such a thing? I think you would. Now, you listen to me, Anna. I don't know where this is... I think you must do what you have to. I want you to. But you are mine, Will Brangwen. You're my man. And I'll never let you go. And if I have ever wronged you, it was fear, you must understand that. I understand you have gone mad! No. Now, I have my sanity. And you must do whatever it takes, but then you must come back to me. Because we cannot just whiten into ash. -We have to find a way. -That's enough! Just stop with all your make it good again. What has come over you? -What are you doing? -I'm going out. -But... -You want me out, don't you? I'm not interested in you any more. Not like this! I must mend my ways. Well, bugger you! If I'm that bad, you'll not miss me! Will you? You don't understand me. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] I'll have a bitter. And a port. Oh, God! That's the spirit. I thought you had cleared off. -I'm back. -Apparently. It's the small talk I can't bear. It's a black art. Don't you agree? Has anyone seen my purse? [CHUCKLING] Good Lord, Diana. What have you come as? A Christmas tree? If the world were ending my sister would merely ask, "Does the molten sun go with my sash, do you think?" -Ah, present. -What? It is today, isn't it? The actual birthday. I haven't given you a present yet. Did you wrap it yourself? Yes. You should have left the light on. It's a cigarette lighter. It's called Wonderlite. It stays on until you shut the lid. [GERALD CHUCKLES] That is marvellous. Thank you. Oh, bugger! Oh! -It's fine. -Sorry. All set. I hope you are. There are plenty here already. And I shall attend to them. Every one. Good. You're a Crich, Gerald. Never forget that. We can be relied upon. Yes, we can. Good boy. Yes. HERMIONE: Rupert. At last. I have some Wagner. I wanted to tell you. I know you like to listen. Yes, yes. I should like that. Oh, you could come back after Church tomorrow. Oh, I don't think I'll be going. Why not? Oh, I just... I have some things to do. I'll ring you to arrange a time. If Gerald can spare you, of course. I just don't want your brain to atrophy, Rupert. That's all. You are one of our great minds and spending time with Gerald Crich... Unless, of course, you want to know all the new ways of getting coal from the ground? You cannot speak to me like that any more. We are just friends now. Rupert, no matter what you tell yourself, you know the truth as well as I. We will never just be friends because you need me too much. I am your spiritual bride and that is why I find it so objectionable, to discover that I am overlooked for the attentions of a dull, boorish, oaf. You're such a snob. No. I am honest about who I am. I do not go slumming for entertainment. Excuse me. One moment. SKREBENSKY: We should probably set off quite soon. You have had quite a look now. I think Skegness might have been better. More to do. Here is perfect! Oh, no. Absolutely, I've loved it. All those... All the sand, water. I have to give you this. What have I done wrong? -Nothing. -So? You do not accompany me, into the unknown. You do not set off with me through life into wonder. -It's just words. -Oh! Words. Now tell me why you cannot be with me, so I can understand. You don't satisfy me. What? Physically, you. The other things they are the journey which lovers must take. So they may feel the earth between their toes. But the journey must first be ignited. And you don't. I don't satisfy you? You have never satisfied me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. [URSULA GRUNTING] [CRYING] [GRUNTING] [PEOPLE LAUGHING] MAN: Thank you. Thank you. Madam, if you could wake the man up next to you, we need the seat for the eight o'clock house. WOMEN: Cheers. Cheers. WILL: That was the best turn we have had. I've a good mind to go up Rollins for a cup of their best coffee and some of their pastry fancies. If anyone would care to be treated. Come here. [WHISPERS] No, he is not coming. [BOTH MOANING] I can still taste that cake on you. Weren't it lovely? Not as lovely as you. All right, then. Give us your jacket. This is me best frock. I'm not getting grass up it. Yeah. [BOTH MOANING] [WILL GROANING] No! What? No. What you on about? I said you could. Yeah, I know. I know. I can't. What do you mean you can't? What's wrong with me? Oh, there's nowt wrong with you. You're beautiful. You're... [EXHALES] I had a girl like you. And her skin was like yours. Only now it in't. But that's all right 'cause it got like that with me. Do you see? A young lad needs to look on you. Not some old bugger like me. Young lad. Who knows nowt else but you. Isn't that better? You must have me, Robert. Or else you are incomplete. I know you better than you know yourself. People make such a fuss about sex. But it really is the most natural thing in the world. Why mightn't we do it when we please? Robert? Yes. What are you doing? I'm going to get dressed. There's a train in about 25 minutes. We could still... I can still... Go back? Please, don't say anything. Robert... You don't have to come. You can stay here. Enjoy the place. I already paid the bill, any extras, breakfast... There's a carriage ride along the front. I think that's included. Are you insane? Was this your plan all along? Once the ship was breached, to desert it like a bloated rat? How can you say that? How can I? It's not I, who seconds after emptying myself of my precious seed, runs for the station! It's my own fault. You warned me. You warned me at the station that you hadn't the stomach for it. This is not that! I swear. What is it, then? It's... I cannot ever feel better than this. I know that for a certainty. This is my summit. And all that remains from here on in is an approximation of life with Beatrice. Don't say her name. I'm sorry. I just want you to know why I have to leave. Because now that we have had... You will tire of me. I'm your experiment and I know it. It's fine. But you will move on. And I cannot allow that decay, not between us. I am complete for ever like this. [DOOR CLOSING] [PEOPLE CHEERING] BIRKIN: Ah. I've been looking all over for you. I'm sorry. I'm not much company. I mean, it's worse than before. I thought I'd better enjoy things in absentia. What is wrong? I told you. I hate parties, especially birthdays. Something always drags me down. I try to get to the bottom of it... Oh, don't do that. That is called introspection. It's terribly destructive. Especially if you're not the sort. Get in. Have a plank. [YELLS] [LAUGHS] You have been enjoying yourself. [GROANS] We are fine. We can drift a bit. Get down. What? Get out of the car. It is another 18 miles. Walk it. Give me your shoes. Give them to me. Now you may feel the earth between your toes. Feel it until they bleed! Do you know of Blutbruderschaft? -Blood brothers? -Yes. I mean, originally it was German knights. They made a cut in their arms and then they rubbed each other's blood into the cut. Doesn't sound awfully hygienic. Well, I think the idea was when a man found another man that he admired and that feeling was reciprocated, it was a kind of a way of showing a sort of loyalty or commitment, or almost a love. You'd need to love someone to carve yourself open. All the same, I think where we are now in history... Perhaps Nietzsche is right. The world does spin of its own accord. Not divinely but just, because it does. As we do here drifting on the water randomly, straying through an infinite nothing. Rupert, I haven't got a solitary clue what you're on about. Good old Gerald. Perhaps God is dead. What? I think He is. Or surely, he'd look after those who looked after Him, a little bit better, don't you think? Give them the odd sign, leg up. Keep fighting the good fight. And if there is no Deus ex machina forming our future and... Well, where does the answer to tomorrow lie? It's with us, Gerald. With humanity. So we must declare ourselves. If there is, but this one life, we must not waste it in hesitation. [LOUD SPLASH] -What's that? -LAURA: Di! There's somebody in the water. LAURA: Di! GERALD: Row up. Quickly! Stay out of the water! Nobody else go in! MAN: It's your sister, Gerald. It's Diana! LAURA: It's Di, Gerald. Diana fell in. I know. Who's gone in after her? Young Dr Brindell. I am responsible. Gerald, you can't go in there. Gerald! LAURA: Di! Diana! [GASPING] BIRKIN: Gerald! Will? Anna? Is it done? Turn the lamp on. What? Let me see you. See you as you are. [EXHALES] I could never be unfaithful to you. You have my soul, Anna Brangwen. -I tried. -[SHUSHING] Undress. Come to bed, be with me. I don't understand, Anna. What happened? I mistrusted you. And that is an end to it. But I've never... You're unfettered, Will. And I am not. You scare me sometimes. I'll risk everything, I promise. So must you, again, with me. -Come. -Where? To bed. I can't go to sleep when they're still in the water. MR CRICH: Gerald. Father. Do you have them, yet? Are they safe? No, I fear it's too late. [GASPS] Oh, God. Get back to it. You are in charge! They're gone! The currents are too strong. I'm sorry. LAURA: Father, there's nothing we can do. They're dead, Gerald! Gerald! They're dead. GERALD: She killed him, as he tried to save her. Thank you for staying. You've to go to London today, don't you? I'm there myself later in the week. We should perhaps meet up. BIRKIN: Gerald? GERALD: What? -Your sister... -What? Nothing. Just nothing. Just... You think we should discuss it, don't you? No, not discuss. Just... I'm getting on, Rupert. Spirit of the Age. Isn't that what you said? Hmm? Like an exploding shell. A machine. It was strange, you know, under the water. It's so black and vast down there. A man could be consumed. But on the surface, in the air, I am a machine, Rupert. I need fuelling, certain things to keep me oiled. But that's it. After that, I just carry on. Through everything. Did you see? He died trying to save her. Yes, you said. She would not have overpowered me. Lass, come here. [SOBBING] Oh, come here. I never liked him. Thick as pig shit. [LAUGHS] And not half your wit. No. Take care. You, too. Mr Gerald. Abby! I didn't expect to see you here. Oh, my mother lives here. Arkwright Street. Ah. I'm so sorry about Miss Diana. Yes. Thank you. Dreadful business. Would you care for a drink? Yates's is, uh... I think I could do with a little something. Only if you have time. No. I should like that. [GIGGLES] [EXHALES] Thank you. [WHISTLE BLOWING] [TRAIN APPROACHING] Like a panther, she comes! Champagne, Charlie. Put it on Maxim's account. I thought you weren't back until tomorrow. She's worn the poor bugger out. There were some difficulties. You didn't go! No, we went. We stayed in a wonderful hotel. In Brighton. -Huzzah! -Huzzah! Then we came back this morning. You lying bitch. He was back in my bed last night after having had his fill with you. Excuse me! No, I won't. But he's gone now dear Robert. He left me a note. To say how happy you made him. He realised he could no longer continue his dull, sterile life. So he was leaving for a new start. This, dear children, is the whore who stole your father. Madam, if you were a lady... Oh, I am a lady. I was brought up properly, with manners and decency and loyalty. Not to fuck my way into society. How dare you! Oh, yes! I am a lady, which you, despite your fine clothes and bottles of champagne, clearly are not. You're a common slut! And judging by these faces staring at you, they know it, too. [DOOR CLOSING] ♪ Young girl, and have just come over ♪ Over from the country where they do things big ♪ And amongst the boys I've got a lover ♪ You dirty fucking queer! Break, you bastard. Fucking break! Break, you bastard. Fucking break! Is that the best you can do? Show me something else. Something better!
