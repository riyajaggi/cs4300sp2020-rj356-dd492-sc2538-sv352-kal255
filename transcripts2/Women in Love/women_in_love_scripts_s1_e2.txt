 STABLE BOY: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Easy, girl! I think we should get rid of her, Mr Gerald. She's uncontrollable. Nothing is uncontrollable. It's just a matter of will. I'll tame her. How's your father, sir? I hope you don't mind me asking but is he any better? He's alive, Mr Sutton. Or he was when I left him half an hour ago. I've no doubt he'll hang on for my sister's wedding. He's paying for it after all. [CHUCKLES] [HURRIED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [DOOR OPENING] Gudrun. What are you doing? I've a train to catch. But the opening? Will be a triumph. Really, Maurice, the exhibits are ready. The gallery looks wonderful. Mightn't we at least go for a drink? The Pompadour's... Oh, I don't go in there, Maurice. You know that. It's full of frauds. Anyway, I'm expected and I mustn't disappoint. [DOOR OPENS] BIRKIN: For goodness sake, Gerald. Sit still. He does it deliberately. He knows I hate waiting. He's got a wooden leg. He could hop. Gerald, it's a night out at the theatre. It's Hamlet.It's not torture. Well, we'll see about that, won't we? [CHILDREN SINGING] [SQUEAKING] I was surprised when you said you were coming home. Well, I was bored. That's all. I wanted to see if the situation was merely geographical. Such a long time, this last one, though. I think we'd rather given up on you. What happened, Prune? Nothing happened. Nothing at all. I was becoming an artist and... And surviving a war like everybody else. [CHUCKLES] Well, you're here now. That's the main thing. C'est bon! [PEOPLE CHATTERING] What a moaner. I was going to wave my handkerchief halfway through. Hope they'd take me outside and shoot me. I know you only say it to irritate me. Let's go and have some supper. Try and rescue the evening. Just let me say hello. Don't expect me to lie on your behalf. I'm not going to pretend I enjoyed it. Relation or otherwise. Rupert! Hello, Sam. Well, how good of you to come. Oh, not at all. It was wonderful. Samantha, this is Gerald Crich. Pleased to meet you, Mr Crich. And I, you. Excellent. Best I've seen. [LAUGHS] Mmm. Oysters in Nottingham. Apparently, it's the most landlocked place in the country. Oh, if Gerald wants something, he usually gets it. How do you two know each other, then? Did you fight together? It's hard to say. I tended to keep my eyes shut most of the time. -He won a medal. -Oh! We knew each other before the war. Then we took up again after I resigned my commission. I worked as a nurse at Dover. Did Rupert tell you? Do you know, he was incredibly vague about his "theatrical" cousin. Especially in certain key areas. [SAMANTHA LAUGHS] I don't normally do this. Never kid a kidder. [GASPING] This is a nice surprise. I need a change. I can't walk through town like this. Listen, you couldn't do me a favour, could you? I left in a bit of a hurry this morning. I didn't have time to give anything. -Money? -What else? [BIRKIN SCOFFS] Sam won't want money. She's not... I think I'd rather close the account. All the same. £10, say? No! No, do your own dirty work. I'm merely trying to behave like a gentleman, Rupert. Maintain a few standards. Christ, Gerald. Where've you been the past four years? The old ideas are as dead as nails. We must find a new way of existing. [CHUCKLES] Rupert, I want you to drop some money off for me. Not open a bloody vein. What do you live for? To make things go, to move forwards. Still? Oh, and you would have us go backwards, would you? Or sideways, perhaps? I mean, one never knows with you, Rupert. You've revoked God, you've revoked humanity. Should the bunnies be quaking now? I mean, what the bloody hell's left? Love. The more I think about it... It's so blindingly obvious. Love is the antithesis of death, of negation. It's the purest positive form. And it is meant to be the centre and core of our lives. Meaningful union. With a member of the opposite sex. As nature intended. That has to be the be all and end all of our existence and anything else... Meaningless sating of a body, a corrupt body, which rots... Rupert, I slept with the woman. I didn't fuck her in the grave! Besides which, when it comes to behaving correctly with a lady, perhaps you should take a little look in the mirror. You're not exactly blemish free there yourself, are you? Saddle her up. But, Mr Gerald, she's not ready. -Just do it! -Yes, sir. [NEIGHING] Good day. Gerald Crich. And you are? Gudrun Brangwen. Our school teacher's sister. The artist. You should really let her back until the train has passed. She's fine. -You're hurting her. -I'm teaching her. She doesn't like it! I don't care! Hurry up! [GRUNTS] You've made her bleed. Miss Brangwen, she is no use to me if she shies and whinnies every time she hears a train. In addition, you must understand that deep down she wants to be ridden. That's how horses are. They've two wills. With the one they want to be wild and free. But with the other, they want to put themselves in the human power completely. And that is a fact of life. Oh, aren't you a proud man, Mr Crich! Aren't you a proud man! Prune, there you are. -Hello. -Ooh, may I? I can't settle. I'm out of my rhythm. I'll walk home with you. I'm not going. There's a wedding. Father's playing. I thought I'd like to hear how he sounds. All right. Rupert Birkin will be there. It's a chance to see him. Really? Prune, I've told you we are friends, nothing more. Of course. Try not to look quite so famished. There! There's Rupert Birkin in the green. That's Rupert Birkin? Oh, I'm sorry, in your letters, you... I just thought there'd be more of him. [LAUGHS] URSULA: That's Hermione Roddice. Come, there's nothing more to see. GERALD: Winnie! [SCREAMING] [BOTH LAUGH] Miss Brangwen! I thought it was you. How do you do? Very well, thank you. And your sister. -How nice to see you again. -URSULA: Uh... We bumped into each other this morning. You should have come into the church, there was room at the back. Well, I did not intend to come at all, but Ursula wanted to hear our father playing. And it was first class. As ever. Rupert, don't slink off. Miss Brangwen is here. -Really, there's... -Nonsense! He'd be mortified to think he missed you. Rupert. We did wave. I was just about to say so. GERALD: Well, that's a start. Do you know Miss Brangwen's sister? No. No, I think you'd moved to London before... You are Gudrun Brangwen? Well, I've two of your pieces. Hermione Roddice. Oh! How nice. Whenever I see Miss Brangwen, I always remind her what a talented sister she has. You must bring your genius to see me at Breadalby. Of course, we're hugely proud of what Ursula has achieved, too, at the school. How do you two know each other? Oh, we had a row this morning. But it's all forgotten now. How is the animal? Gudrun, what is the matter? Well, what do you think? Crich, behaving as if he owns the very ground upon which I walk. Well, he does for the most part. Room at the back in the public pews. How dare he? GERALD: Father, I was thinking. Do you suppose Winnie might benefit from some extra tuition? She seems to have a particular talent for drawing. Perhaps, we should encourage her rather more in that direction. I think it's... I think it's an excellent idea, Gerald. Do you have anyone in mind? I think there may be someone. Leave it to me. Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to alarm you. You didn't. Oh, it's so dark. I think it's going to rain. The children don't return until tomorrow. Yes, I know, I, uh... I'm not here officially. I thought I ought to come. Seeing you at the church the other day, I realised I hadn't been in touch for some time and... I didn't want you to think that I was behaving improperly with you. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Rupert! It is you. Hermione, what are you doing here? Well, I was driving. I saw your car. [HERMIONE LAUGHS] Miss Brangwen, twice in as many days. How delightful. Hermione... Do remind your sister, won't you? My invitation. I do so want to discuss her work, Rupert. It's full of a primitive passion. I think that you would really... I am well aware of Miss Brangwen's oeuvre, thank you. I will call again when term has started. Though, as I say, everything here seems exemplary. Is it though, Rupert? Is Miss Brangwen really helping our children? Oh, she teaches them to understand the flower. To know all its functions and its biology. But in so doing, doesn't she condemn them to miss the most important thing of all, the flower's essential scent? Knowing is everything to you, Hermione. It is all your life. You must leave Miss Brangwen alone, Rupert. She will want her tea. She cannot sit around listening to your theories all day. Please, don't take any notice of her. What you do here is wonderful. Mr Birkin. -Rupert! -Yes? Is there something the matter? Yes. Yes, there is. I'm confused, I confess. You see, we've known each other for some time now. Especially, since I broke off my engagement and... We've become friends, I think. You certainly treat me warmly. More than you might a friend, I suspect, and yet, that is all we are. Friends. Still. And people have started to comment. They wonder at our relationship and I defend it. But what do you want of me, Mr Birkin? I don't understand. MR CRICH: Winnie, this is Miss Brangwen. WINIFRED: How do you do? MR CRICH: I'll leave you to get to know each other. So... How shall we begin? We can draw Bismarck. -Bismarck? -He's through there. Mr Crich! I'm here. See? He looks so splendid. He's almost as big as a lion. Shall we take him out? GERALD: He's a fearful kicker. We'll try, shall we? Come on. There we go. You should get one of the men to do that for you. [GROANING] Bismarck, you're behaving terribly. Oh, you... [GERALD GRUNTS] I know these beggars of old. He's not hurt, is he? No. But he ought to be. They do scratch so, don't they? Oh, how vile. Mine's nothing. What a devil. URSULA: I love the water. GUDRUN: Well, you know, we may treat it as our own from now on. I wonder if dear Gerald holds the rest of his employees in the same regard. I do think he's quite in awe of me. It's rather wonderful. I hope you don't encourage him. Oh, Ursula, Gerald's a man. They think it's their right to have you. You don't need to encourage them. [GASPING] So tired. Very tired. Just concentrate on getting better. Look to the long game. URSULA: Did you have many men? GUDRUN: What? In London? You seem to have grown up such a lot and sometimes in your letters. [LAUGHS] Ursula, really. I'm curious. I'm not... I have so little experience, you see. Apart from Anton. That's your own business. Do you think love needs sex? That is why I ask. What? I mean, when you are in love, and there is a physical relationship, I know that sex must burn at the very core of it. I just wonder whether... In the way that some can seem to have sex totally outside of love and enjoy it. Can others, perhaps, find love outside of sex? Where does sex fit in relation to love? Do you think? Sex is power. It's where we have power. Beyond that I don't go. [BIRDS SQUAWKING] You see? You're a man, you want to do a thing, you do it. Seriously, Gudrun. The men I've slept with in town, the bohemian crowd, they're bohemian because they can afford to be. They're rich and they're lazy and they're spoilt and... Sex is all they're good for. Love's never really an issue, so I don't trouble myself with thoughts of it. [GASPS] Winifred! I'm late for our lesson. HERMIONE: Right. Music and cigarettes. GUDRUN: No more witticisms, please. I shall commit murder. I think you'd get away with it. No one would blame you. [WHISPERING] He keeps staring at me. That's good, surely. HERMIONE: Mmm. Salsie! Sorry, I'm late. This is my brother, everyone. Just down from The Lords. Come along. Have you met my driver? My God, Gerald! Are you all right? Don't indulge him. He could've waited for Roberts. Let him try and fix it. I did fix it. Allow me. I'm sorry, is it not clean? It's fine. Thank you. Forgive me. I didn't expect to see you here. Oh, I do apologise. It's my artistic bent, you see. It gets me into the poshest of places. I'm going for a walk. Will you come with me? Ursula. Don't speak. Just listen to me, please. Please, don't doubt my feelings for you. Rupert. I need to see you. Actually, I'm rather busy. It won't wait, I'm afraid. I really must insist. Are you ready? Yes. Yes, a walk would be good. GUDRUN: Come on. It's beautiful. And worth the money? If you have it, yes. It's a first edition. Well, I've bought it for you. -Hermione, please. -What? I had hoped that we could remain friends, but I see now... I know she is my rival. Miss Brangwen. She is not your rival. No one is your rival because there is nothing between us, -you and me. -[LAUGHS] How plain must I be? We are done, Hermione. And yet here you are. [SCOFFS] You asked me to look at a book. Isn't there always a reason? I'm leaving. No! -Kiss me. -What? Kiss me. What? Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! Why would you do that of all things? We are dead in the ground. Don't dig the corpse up. [GRUNTS] No, you don't. I don't let you. [SOBBING] GUDRUN: Oh, it's so much more magical at night. Let's bathe. But we haven't any costumes. Oh, Gudrun! [SQUEALING] [BOTH LAUGHING] URSULA: Oh, I do sometimes entertain fantasies of being utterly kept, you know. Having this sort of thing on tap. Oh, you'd be bored witless in a week. That's why the rich all intermarry. You are too cruel. It's why you behave as you do with Gerald Crich, isn't it? The rich can't be universally dismissed. Some of them are just like us. They bleed, too, Gudrun. Oh, yes. Gerald Crich has suffered much. He lost his brother. What? When? Mother told me. He was killed when they were both quite young. No one knows the details. Apparently, the whole town was gossiping about it. I think it all got hushed up, in truth. My point being... He is quite worthy of your attention. If you only thought fit to give it. Let's get out. I'm cold. ♪ You are my honey, honeysuckle ♪ I am the bee ♪ I'd like to sip the honey sweet ♪ From those red lips, you see ♪ I love you dearly, dearly ♪ And I want... I wish I could draw you. Sorry, I... It's all right. I was miles away. [HOOVES POUNDING] [COWS MOOING] I'm sure they won't do anything. Careful! [GUDRUN LAUGHING] [GERALD SHOUTING] What do you think you're doing? Why have you come? You were so long, you... It's not safe. The bull gored one of the farmers' cows to death the other day. Oh, what do I care of that? What do you care? Of his cattle? Nothing. I imagine. Have you any idea how much money they are worth? Money? Oh, you've been waiting for this moment, haven't you? -To feel safe. -What are you talking about? Ever since you invited me to Shortlands, you've wanted me in this exact position. I'm your equal, Gerald Crich. You have struck the first blow. And I shall strike the last. It's no good being angry with me. It's you who makes me behave like this. I'm not angry with you. [PANTING] [MOANING] Miss Brangwen, I wasn't sure you were in today. Couldn't you see me from the attic? The line of sight was perfect for me. You were away all of yesterday. That's why I was uncertain. Indeed. I feared a cold but it seems I'm quite well. Was there anything the matter? Would you care to join me for dinner this evening? I should be delighted if you would. Of course. BIRKIN: Ursula. Oh, my God! I knew you came this way back from school. What happened? Oh, no, it's nothing. I fell. Where have you been? You disappeared from the party. I want you to be with me! You asked me what I wanted from you and... That's it. It's over between me and Hermione. Finally. I... I want you to be with me, but it's not love that I offer you. Well, not in the usual sense. And nor do I want it returned in that form either. Do you understand? That you don't love me? Except in some strange, obscure way which requires a lot of hand wringing. No. Do you find me good looking, even? Or attractive? It's not a question of looks. I want a woman that I don't see. I want a union where nothing that is already known applies. [SIGHS] You think I'm raving, don't you? Here's a bash on the bonce and then the ramblings start. I'm done with this world, Ursula. It's let me down. God and man. Now I want to explore another way of living. And what do you hope to find at the end of this great expedition of yours? Peace. A lasting peace. You always dress for dinner? I believe in good manners. Then I apologise if I'm lowering the tone, somewhat. Of course, if you'd warned me. Miss Brangwen. Why do you tease me so? I don't care what you wear. I do care that you haven't spoken a single word of the other night. You talk to me of good manners, Mr Crich? It happened, and it was delightful. And now we move on. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Dr Oxley is leaving, sir. Excuse me. Oh, Gerald. What is it? Yes. Sorry. The doctor wanted to get off. What did he say? There was some medicine. New medicine. Yes, you told me. Right. But it hasn't worked. It was always a long shot, so... That's it. More or less. Just have to wait now. Continue to wait. What are you doing? I must go. And... [CHUCKLES] Yes, you should be alone anyway. Let me drive you. No, I'd rather walk. Then I'll walk with you. It's so strange in our old age, we become like children again. That's how Father is now. I'm everything to him. He could be my son. GUDRUN: You mustn't give up hope. In our family, once anything goes wrong, it can never be put right again. You know I killed my brother? Oh, Ursula said that there was an accident when... When you were both very little. I shot him. Found a gun in the gamekeepers lodge. Played with it as boys do. It went off. And I killed him. Gerald. Gerald! [MOANING] [GUDRUN EXCLAIMING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [PANTING] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] Ursula. You didn't think to tell me? What? I went to your Nottingham townhouse. They said you no longer resided there. Oh, well, it was to be a surprise. So, don't you think it wonderful? And it's not only the rooms I've given up, but my job, too. I've some savings I can draw on and... I want to write. Perhaps, I'll be able to sell that. What matters is finding one's own way, Ursula. Refusing to conform, hmm? HERMIONE: Rupert? -Oh! She's just arrived. -Rupert. Where do you want this? Um, just one minute. She came to apologise. -Take me home. -Ursula. Ursula. Take me home! I ran into her in town. She was contrite. And to show it, she thought she might help you rearrange your furniture? I was being decent. Why must I hate her? She tried to bludgeon you to death. If you weren't so jealous, you'd understand. Jealous? Of Hermione Roddice? She is nothing to me. Not that... It is you I despise. And your lies. You're like a dog who must return to his own vomit. You're a fool! Yes, I am a fool. And thank God for it! I'm too big a fool to swallow your cleverness. So go to your soul mate. Since I'm common and fleshly, aren't I? What? I lust after physical things. I showed you my love and you were repulsed! -No. -Yes. I would have done it, Rupert. There. In the churchyard. I wanted to do it. Sex. Because sex is important to me, and I am not ashamed to say so. I wanted to be with you, as I understand it. Except, when you felt my need, you pulled away. -No! -You did! It turned your stomach! It did not! It did not. Forgive me, I... I don't know how... I don't know how... I don't know how I should live any more. Every single breath comes with such responsibility now. It's something of a burden. All the more reason not to hide away. To engage fully. Life is savage, Rupert. Or it is not life at all. [SOBBING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] ALBERT: Letter for you, Mr Crich. Thank you, Albert. [WHISTLE BLOWING] Gerald. There! Can't expect to move into a new place without a few house warming presents, can you? What? What are you doing? -I came to... -Gerald. You're not yourself, despite any avowals to the contrary. [LAUGHS] Good old Rupert. Like a mind reader sometimes. All right. I want you to come to Africa with me. To Africa? I've bought a mine. Diamonds, this time. Got it off a German chap, believe it or not. I need to go and see it, so... Your father... Of course, I don't mean right away, go. But soon, I think. And, obviously, from your point of view, there'll be no cost. I'll... Why? Why would I just leave? Why wouldn't you? There's... There's Ursula. She and I seem to have found a decent understanding lately. Even better! I hoped she'd come. In fact I've already... Gerald! Tell me the truth, Gerald. All this trouble and expense. What's the real reason? I want Gudrun to accompany me. And I think if her sister and you... What? I haven't actually been able to ask her myself. She's in London. She took off. She's uncertain of me, I think. But I do know that if she were to spend some proper time with me, then she'd see that I'm serious. About Gudrun? You're serious about her? I enjoy her company. We've become close. But she's not your sort at all. What do you mean "my sort"? Look, Rupert, I bought you a bloody pineapple. I'm expecting some support over this. Yes, but... It's not love though. What? You're not in love with her? Why do you say that? I mean... Why do you assume? Well, I assume because, as I'm sure you'd be the first to admit, it is sex which usually binds you to a woman. And I can only say that for Gudrun, I do have feelings. Oh, I'm sure you have feelings, Gerald. But where do they start and where do they end? Hmm? All the same, the four of us. On an adventure. I think it would be a wonderful tonic, don't you? [BELL TOLLING] No. You must... You must put it down. You must put it down. Be careful. No. Father... Father, I've had words. Father, please! Father, please. GERALD: I want you to write a letter to Miss Brangwen. Tell her to come back immediately. Say that you're sick. But she's already here. She called this afternoon. My lessons resume tomorrow. Jesus. Jesus... [BREATHING HEAVILY] Is he... There. He looks better now. I'll give you a minute. [WHIMPERS] [SOBBING] Why have you come? Because I must. Why do you ask? I must ask. BIRKIN: Slow down. You're gonna kill me. URSULA: There's a rather lovely simplicity to Gerald, isn't there? GUDRUN: Well, he's a doer. He'll tell anyone that. Oh, sweets! I would like a pennyworth of those, please. BIRKIN: Hurry up! GERALD: For goodness sake! It's going in two minutes. You need to get on board. And where are you going? To get some cigarettes. And a paper. [LAUGHS] SAMANTHA: Rupert! Gerald! Samantha. -How are you? -Very well. I... I came to see Rupert off. [WHISPERS INAUDIBLY] [WHISTLE BLOWING] URSULA: Prune, give me a hand with my case, will you? God, what a mess. [WHISTLE BLOWING] [EXCLAIMS] It's a different world. My God, Jerry. You've done it now. Do we have to ride? After a journey like that, I want to stretch my legs a little. GERALD: By all means, Rupert. It's 120 degrees. You take Shank's. I'll take the pony. It's about two hours, apparently. I've reached my place, Gerald. -Finally. -Our place. You've reached our place. What? What? I don't have to. Every time. But I want to. [MOANS] GERALD: The settlers just went. As soon as the next haul of diamonds or gold was discovered. They just upped and offed. GUDRUN: Why couldn't they be satisfied? GERALD: Because people never are. [ALL CHEERING] What did I do wrong? Cheers. Encore! GERALD: See? Merely a question of practise. Come on, let's try again. Okay. Gluttons! [LAUGHING] What? You've convinced me, finally. I surrender to my heritage. To the visceral, sodden, Midlands and their dirty, dirty men. [MAN CLEARS THROAT] They are getting it, your friends. The Schuhplattler. -Bless you. -[LAUGHS] I mean the dance. That is its name. It's Schuhplattler. Bloody exhausting, that's what we'd call it in England. Gerald Crich. I'm Wolfgang Loerke. -And I'm... -Gudrun Brangwen. I saw your name in the register. I am an artist, too. Your work is in Berlin. No. A private collection in the Altes Museum. Good heavens! [CHUCKLES] Please, sit down. -So, which museum? -The Altes Museum. A private collection on loan. Mein Herr?My niece would be most pleased to dance with you. Ah, I see. Isn't her English very good? My English is perfect. But one would hate to give the impression that German girls do not know how to behave in polite company. In that case, the pleasure is all mine. The young woman is... How do you say it? She is von Blut... It's like a lady. From one of the oldest families in Bavaria. [GIRL EXCLAIMING] [GRUNTING] [MOANING] [LAUGHING] Rupert. Mmm? We have something, don't we? What? How can you say that? We love each other. We can go anywhere. We can do anything. We make our own rules. Yes, of course. Gerald, what a fine game you played tonight. GERALD: Hmm? -Isn't she in love with you? -What? That girl. What was her name? The one you danced with? God knows. She was, uh... I assure you, I addressed her quite formally all night. Well, it obviously did the trick. Gudrun, I don't... I can picture her, Gerald, even now, lying there, overwhelmed with love for you. It really was too shameful, the way you swept her off her feet. That was the Schuhplattler. That's not a criticism. Just an observation. She was very confident. On the other hand, it would make a perfect marriage. The upper classes uniting across Europe. Stop it! For God's sake, what's the matter with you? Tell me you weren't hard when you held her against you. And I'll cease this instant. BIRKIN: Race you. See? What? You're done. You've no strength. [WHOOPING] Winner! [LAUGHS] See, you're as weak as a baby. What are you talking about? The walls aren't terribly thick you know, Gerald. What? The night time. Since you got here. No wonder you're tired. And I'm the only one indulging in that particular pleasure, am I? I suspect you're the only one who's been indulging in it quite so vigourously. -Enough! -What? All the fucking time! What are you talking about? You never fucking stop. Sex is what brings a man to a woman. What? [BOTH GRUNTING] GERALD: But that doesn't mean... What are you talking about? Meaningful union that you speak of. That happens... That happens once the ardour is played out. [COUGHING] Love is special! You're right. I do know that. Where sex is earth and sea and water and air. It's commonplace. But as long as we admit it. That it makes machines of all of us, for a while. Then we pass through it to the other side, where you sit so proudly. I know about love! You don't fucking lecture me! [COUGHING] GERALD: Love, come and have some food. I want to finish this. Prune, you must have something. You'll make yourself ill. A drink at least. It's very good. It's a local dish. It's a curry. God, this place is wonderful. I could live here forever. You should, then. Just like that? Why not? If you desire something, you should make it happen. There speaks a man who has wanted for nothing his entire life. I'm going. -BIRKIN: What? -You're right. I'm here to get things done. It's too hot now. Don't be ridiculous. Gerald! Wait! I know I've made you like this. But I have to be... Perhaps if you weren't so... I have to be true to myself. And Rupert's right. You come from a different world. What? The rules that you apply to living are... They're yours. They're yours alone and I can't be with somebody like that. I think we should have separate rooms. What are you talking about? This is... You can say that you need a dressing room. Or I am ill. Gudrun, this is nonsense. All over some dance. I don't give two ha'pennies for the bloody girl! She is nothing to me. And she's not the point. It's your whole attitude. It's who you are. If you face facts, Gerald, please be sensible. It's best to stop this now, before... Before it becomes serious. -Before? -What? Jesus! I took pity on you because of the dreadful state you were in. It was never love. You don't think you love me, do you? Not really. It's always been perfectly clear what this relationship's about. I, uh... I feel strongly for you. [SCOFFS] And that's not the same thing, is it? Not really. Not proper love. Because you don't feel like that, do you? And you never will. You're... You'll never love me as a man should. Because you're not capable of loving me like that, are you? No. Well, then... Let's be kind to ourselves. We should be friends. And nothing more. Gerald is like the richest food in the world. He's delicious at first, but he's deadening finally. Its lack of subtlety. Gudrun! It's best that we're honest about these things. Life's too short for compromise. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm ravenous. BIRKIN: Jesus! What happened to you? My beautiful companion prefers the company of some hideous portrait pedlar. And I am getting drunk. That's it, I think. For God's sake, Gerald. Pull yourself together. Go and talk to her. What are you doing? I'm giving this young woman the eye. Couldn't you just take her outside and ride her until the sweat sat in puddles on her collarbone? I could. I could. I do like her, though. [GUDRUN LAUGHING] You'll write? Of course. And you really must go? We must. I think Rupert's right. We're not helping. And you will manage here with Gerald? Perhaps not together. But we'll manage. I want you to have these. Sweets for my sweet. The most beautiful things I possess for the most beautiful woman I know. Come with us. We could travel together. -No, I'm perfectly fine. -You shouldn't stay. You say that, but you're not. Really. Really I am. You're pretending. You never tell the truth, ever, where it concerns your heart. And it will be the end of you. And you do. You always tell the truth, and you always have. And I've been so envious of that, all my life. I daren't love him. Gerald, he's a... He's a hundred men. He's a thousand men. How can I keep him? Prune, no, you... BIRKIN: Ursula. Please, come. No, go. Go. I forgot my wash bag. Does this mean you'll be coming for dinner this evening? No, I shouldn't think so. [DOOR CLOSING] Do you wish to humiliate me? Isn't it enough that... Mightn't we at least keep up the appearance of civility? I'm being perfectly civil, Gerald. It's you who's rapidly forgetting his manners. What are you doing? I'm getting ready. That's your way, isn't it? You are confronted by a problem and you overcome it, don't you? You just have to grasp the nature and then you bring to pass the inevitable conclusion, at the colliery, or in the war. You make order out of chaos by imposing your will, don't you? Well... Not with me. I bow to no man. I said I'd strike the last blow, and I will. Why him? Hmm? Why the vermin? -Don't be ridiculous. -It's clear you want him. Not me. That's what this is about. I want nothing of him. [LAUGHS] Why do men reduce everything to a matter of sex? Because everything is a matter of sex! I'll make my own way to England. And I'm leaving on Friday. If it's to England that I go. Let me go! [GUDRUN LAUGHING] You are... You are going away, then? Yes. Day after tomorrow. Where? I don't know. You won't tell me where you will go? Really, I don't know. Maria! You come like a ghost. Some schnapps? Perhaps the lady would care for another sip? Gerald! Gerald! Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! [GRUNTS] Stop it! [SCREAMS] [GASPING] Oh, Gudrun! [SOBBING] I loved him so much. I know. I... I... I know. GUDRUN: Oh, God! [SOBBING] [LAUGHING] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've had enough. I want to go to sleep.
