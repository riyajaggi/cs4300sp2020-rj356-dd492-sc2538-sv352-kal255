 Cold Feet (1997–…): Season 6, Episode 5 - Episode #6.5 - full transcript 
 David is formally charged with conspiracy to defraud whilst Karen decides to set up her own company, despite Eddie's misgivings. Pete is still looking for a break as Harry's relatives challenge him over the legacy left to him and Jenny's old flame from fourteen years earlier, ex-alcoholic Grant, comes to visit. He is the father of her daughter Chloe, brought up as Pete's child and threatens the Giffords' security as he tells the truth. Adam meanwhile finds it harder than he imagined to be friends with Matthew.

 As far as I remember, your coffee was actually rather good. My breakfasts are better. David Marsden I'm arresting you on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. I really ought to believe in your innocence, yet I'm not sure. Put me out my misery. - I can't do that, Harry. Yes, you can. Argh! I've just been offered a promotion. - Oh, that's fantastic. I promised Adam I'd stay here. Its four months. If we can't get through that, we shouldn't be together.

 Excuse me, sir. We've landed. Very funny. Hello. - How was it? Hot. Singapore or Angela? - Both. I'm exhausted. - Well, you would be. The heat. I think flying to Singapore and back in the last 72 hours has done it. Still... worth it? I don't want to leave you. It won't be forever. Well, welcome home. Oddly, it's beginning to feel like it. Did Matthew behave himself? - Yeah, as far as I know.

 I did check on him a couple of times. But he seemed to spend most of the weekend with his head in the computer. Oh, your Scotch is still intact. Well, almost, but to be fair, that was me. Er... Oh, we did have one small drama. I caught him trying to reheat some defrosted chicken. That near miss with salmonella poisoning aside, nothing to report. Adam? How did you sleep? - Huh. The spare room. We really must do something about that mattress. Well, you won't be on it again. That's a relief. I mean, I've come to a decision. Even if the police decide that you have no case to answer, there are bound to be those who say that there is no smoke without fire. I might be one of them. - Robyn? Either way... I've realised that I don't really care. Let's face it, David. We live largely separate lives. Well, I didn't ask to sleep in the spare room. You don't like my friends; I don't much care for yours. Our marriage is a habit that neither of us have had the energy to break. Well, now I've found the strength. I want a divorce. I think a clean break would be best. And since two thirds of the equity in the house is mine, that means you leaving. You've nothing else on today, have you? You said you'd be back in time. No worries. I'll take 'em. Right, new plan. You're with me. Chloe's not ready. - How do you know that? You've been on that phone for the last ten minutes. Chloe's never ready. Chloe! I'm leaving five minutes ago! Ugh! Sheila! Is it urgent? Mum's had a bit of a tumble. - Oh, no! How did she do that? Tripped over the cat. She's fine. Bit shaken up. - Mum or Mimi? I think she may have sprained her wrist. Mum. The doctor's on his way, but there's no sign of him. You seen my hairbrush? - You don't need your hairbrush! I'd stay, but I've got to get to work. So do I. - Seen my maths book? I told you to get your stuff ready last night! I'd take the morning off, but I did that last week for the Church Synod. The point is, I think someone needs to be with her. For when the doctor comes. Well, can't she open the door with her good hand? She's a bit shaken up. Did I mention that? Found it! - Hairbrush or maths book? Hairbrush. Sheila, put Mum on. Hi, Mum. How are you? I'm fine, love. Your sister's worrying over nothing. OK. Can you put Sheila back on? Says she's fine. - Oh, she says that... Are we gonna go? - Have you got your maths book? I don't need it. - Told you so. I suppose, if you won't come, I could go in a little late. Oh. It's up to you, Sheila. Seriously, listen, send Mum my love. Tell her I'll see her soon. God, if the Church needs another martyr... Oh... shit. Sorry. No, I'll get it when it, you know... Erm... Ow! Hello. I'd like a room, please. Certainly, sir. How many nights will that be for? Let's say a week to begin with. These are our room rates, sir. - Thank you. Gosh! Can you turn your volume down? I'm getting feedback. Sorry? Yes. Turn your volume down. The feedback's a nightmare. Is that better? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, that's my news. Not very much. What about you? Eh? Even less. It's just work, work, work. Still loving your new job? What? What? - You froze. Ange, what, I froze? Ten years ago we didn't have this technology. Now we complain if it isn't perfect. I ought to be getting to work. Let's arrange for another time to speak. Angela? - What? I missed that. - Do you really have to go to work now? Hello? Hello? Ah. Seriously... Bye. I miss you. We spend most of the time trying to arrange when we can talk and then, when we do, we run out of stuff to say. Well, fair enough. Talking online, it's like visiting people in hospital. Conversation doesn't flow naturally, does it? When Josh started his gap year, he called every day. It just made him homesick. So I said, Stop. Throw yourself into the country you're in. Where is Josh? No idea. I haven't heard from him for months. Spain. He's fine. Our Adam's friends with him on Facebook. Angela and me are great when we're together, but not so great when we're apart. Most couples, it's the other way round. It's only for four months? Ten days till she back here, though. How's she settling into her new job? Oh, God, she talks about nothing else. Oh, here. She had dinner with her Dad the other night, she was saying, and he is very taken with his new girlfriend. Ah! See! Eddie talks about you. She won't tell me nothing. - Not what you want to know! I'm not getting any, OK? So I have to live vicariously through you. Come on. What's his technique, then? Is it like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon? Or more his style, Fast And Furious? Yeah, and she wonders why I'm tight-lipped. Throw us a bone, come on. Our first night together was quite entertaining. Mum? - Shit! Shit! I wasn't expecting her back for ages. Get dressed, get dressed! Come here. Go. Go. Go. Go. Mum? Sorry. Did I wake you? - Is everything all right? My friends can be so annoying! Right I want to know everything, OK? Now, you take your time. Ugh. It made me feel like teenager. I think Eddie failed to mention that. Did he really describe me as his girlfriend? Well, you are, aren't you? - No. I haven't been anyone's girlfriend since the age of 24. It's not like that. We're casual. You know, we go out together, enjoy each other's company. Maybe Edward thinks it's more serious than that. I know he does. He wanted to come back here this week. I had to make up some lame excuse to put him off. I'm not ready for him to be sharing my sock drawer, be introduced to the girls as Mum's new... - Boyfriend. For want of a better description of a man in his early 60s, however adept at yoga. I don't buy that this is about the girls and their reaction. How long has it been since you were in a relationship? The best part of five years. That's why you're holding back. You've just got too used to being on your own. Maybe it's time for you to take the leap. Oh, hello! I was looking for Harry. - Never heard of him. Well, this is his room. Or it was last week. Well, it's my room now. Oh, God! What? Harry's died? That's it! He's dead. What? I only saw him a few days ago. It was Tuesday. I was supposed to come at the weekend. We was supposed to watch the United game together. Have you got any fags? Eh? Nancy! What are you doing in here? It's my room. - It's not, love. What? This isn't her room? Oh, sorry! I didn't see you there. No. Some of them like to wander, and she's the worst. Come on, sweetheart, let's get you home. - Oh! Great! I came to see Harry! I know now is the time he has his physio. But... I thought he was dead! Oh, love, has no-one told you? He passed away on Saturday. Half time in football. That is a summary of our fees to date. If the police do charge you and it goes to trial- It won't come to that. Look, I accept I sailed a little close to the wind. I had to, in order to stay ahead of the pack. But investing in unregulated schemes, that's just a rap over the knuckles, not a criminal prosecution. David, some of your clients' money wound up in Chinese property developments that turned out to be fraudulent. Chinese residential property pays a good return. Not when the residences don't exist. Well, I cashed out before that was discovered. There's the problem. Police think you were in on it. I wasn't. I was nearly the victim. I'm not a criminal. - And that's our position. Should the CPS demur and seek a prosecution, this is an estimate of our fees for preparation of your case to trial including counsel's fees. Ah, that's not so bad. Oh, that's the VAT. Ah. Well, I'm glad it's not something I need worry about. If they do charge me, then I'm sure my firm will pay for my defence. Won't they? They'll form part of the prosecution case. Well, technically. - No, actually. They won't offer you any support, David. They'll hang you out to dry. Does the hotel have a spa? No, but three doors down on the left there's one. Oh! See, Harry wanted to go. He told me. And he asked me to help him. I tried. Well, I'm sure you did help him, love. But what were you gonna do? You said there was a virus going- It wasn't the virus. It was a brain haemorrhage. Well, they don't know. It might have happened in the pub. Or it could have been happened, anyway. Oh, Jen. I didn't want him to die. I really loved him. I know you did. When I get old... I want to be like him. Cantankerous but lovable. You are. When I starting back at work, I thought... I thought I was getting better. But all this it's... it's just put me back down there again. Come here. Now, listen... it's not like having a cold. It's gonna take a bit of time, I think. You've got to be patient. But for what's it worth... I love you. Yeah? - Yeah. What do you mean, you can't come over. - 'Not next weekend. There's a dinner I have to go to with my boss. - But we agreed! Every second weekend. - And it's your turn to come over here. I told him that. He said that this is more important. What, than your marriage? Is he divorced, by any chance? Married to the job. Expects us all to be as well. I'll come the next weekend, I promise. Or what, unless Gus finds another reason to keep you there? There is another alternative. What are you doing next weekend? Well, I was expecting to see you, so currently, nothing. Well you could come here. I mean, I'm the one with the job. I've just got over the jet-lag from the last trip. It's not that bad. If you're 30. What am I supposed to do while you're out at dinner? Sleeping off the jet-lag, by the sounds of it. Look, have you managed to change your flight to the following weekend? I didn't book my ticket yet. - I knew it! You never intended to come. - I did! I just wasn't sure when I could. Yeah, and now it turns out you can't! - Let's talk about it tomorrow.' Why? You think Gus will change his mind? No! But I'm hoping you'll calm down. Fine! Girls. I want to talk to you. Listen, I've invited Eddie to have dinner with us. He'll be staying the night. With me, in my room. Mum, you're not telling us anything we don't know. What? When I came home early the other night, I saw Eddie's car outside. Anything chauffeur-driven tends to stand out round here. I sent him packing so you wouldn't see him. I thought it was rather sweet. - Oh, OK, so... You're all right, then, with the idea of Eddie and me? It's not an image I want in my head. - It's cool, mum. We like him. Yeah. Yeah, I think I do too. God, what's become of us? We used to have such a laugh in the pub. Remember? They got rid of trivia machine. You two liked those. I never knew the answers. Sport and Pop. - Hopeless. Is it this thing with the police that's getting you down? I thought you weren't worried about that. I'm not. Overly. I know! You've heard about Eddie. Getting his feet under the table with Karen. What? - No, I don't think he has heard about that, Pete. Oh, God, I introduced them. She was meant to help me get close to him. Bastard. Sorry, Adam, he's your father-in-law. No, no. So have you managed to patch things up with Angela? Well, as much as you can when you're 7,000 miles apart. You know, I think long-distance romance, it's an oxymoron. Yeah. That's another of those words- - A contradiction in terms. You need to be more imaginative when you use the internet. Porn? - No! Well... No, be more romantic. You know, what do you do when you're together? Hm. - Well, apart from the obvious. Hm. - Ah! I know. Breakfast in bed. It's what I do for Jen when she's got the hump with me. Yeah, well, most mornings, then. It's a bit difficult with her being in Singapore. David. What have you done for Robyn that's romantic? Agreed to a divorce. What? You're getting divorced? - Since when? Since she decided she wanted to. Served me the papers at the budget hotel I'm now calling home. God, I'm sorry, mate. - You never liked Robyn. No-one likes to see their friends getting divorced. Why did you keep it to yourself? It's not something you crow about, is it, the failure of your marriage? I'd clung to the hope that she might see sense, then the papers arrived and... Look, I haven't mentioned this to anyone else. Apart from you two. And I'd really like to keep it that way, as long as I can. Yeah, of course. I won't tell a soul. Ah, it's Karen. Hello? Jen's just texted me. Are you getting divorced? The pasta's ready. - Oh, God! Is he with you now? Yeah. I would offer you some of my anti-depressants, but Jen's told me not to share. Beer? Mum, it's the baby hedgehog having his nails clipped. Only me. - Oh, hello! I didn't expect to see you. Why? Because I never visit? No. Actually, I'm glad you're here. I'm wanting a word. Mum! Left hand, remember? Do you want to see some cats that look like Hitler? Not really, love. Talk to me instead. The physio says Mum shouldn't be using her wrist. Well, she can lift a cup of coffee. Not a saucepan. For now, we're going to have to do things for her. Cooking, cleaning. - You might have the time; I certainly don't. - She needs us, Jen. Now, I've drawn up a rota. - Oh, what? I'll do four days a week, if you do the other three. That seems fair, doesn't it? I'm so sorry, David. Well, if I'm honest, Robyn and I have been drifting apart for a while. It's probably about ten years or more. I had hoped she'd stand by me until this police thing had cleared up. It's pretty shitty if she won't. It must be difficult being under the same roof. Yeah, well, actually, I'm living in a hotel. Not a very nice one. Well, you must stay for dinner. Can't he stay the night? Darling, he won't want to do that, he's got a hotel. Not a very nice one. - It'll do for now. And then what? Hi, Dad! - Dad's homeless. I'm not homeless. As such. - Robyn wants a divorce. She's kicked him out. He's living out of a suitcase. That's terrible! Why can't he live here? - Josh's room is free. He won't want to do that. Please, Mum. Well, I suppose... if it's just for a few days... Everything you ask, Mr Adam. Egg Benedick, buck fizz with fresh squeeze orange, toast with choice of jam, and coffee. Yeah, and a rose? - Naturally. You're naughty, Joe. Right, off you go! Oh, Joe. Joe? - Yes? Pick it up. Turn it around. - Oh. Sorry. Surprise! Who are you?' Angie, there's a waiter at the door! I get the wrong apartment?' Oh, no, you did not. Turn it back, turn it back. Its right. Go! Yes? Adam? Who was that? - What's going on? A surprise breakfast. And what a surprise. Who was that? What? - The guy. The meat head in the towel. Oh, him. He's my cousin. Joe, follow her, follow her! Leave the breakfast!' Go on, get in there. Go on! What cousin? Jerry. From Santa Fe. You never mentioned a cousin. Well, he never came up. Wait, wait, hang on! Your Mum doesn't have any siblings. And your Dad was born in Pakistan!' Ugh. OK. All right. He's not my cousin! He's a colleague. What? - He stayed over. After the dinner. So why did you lie? - Because I knew what you'd think! Too bloody right it's what I'd think! He's gay! He stayed in the spare room! Prove it! - That he's gay? No. That he stayed in the spare room. Take me there. Joe! No! Adam, I'm telling you the truth!' - Well, show me! Don't you trust me? - You've already been caught lying! Please, don't do this to us. Mr Adam, I'm not real comfortable with this. Look, Joe, just show me. Oh, Adam. You're making a big mistake. Just show me. This way. There! Oh! He made the bed. Does he have any clothes? Do you wanna make up some other stories? I was telling the truth! - About Jerry from Santa Fe? Or the gay colleague? Or maybe he's a random guy you picked up in a bar! Oh, that's it! That's exactly it! I was drunk. I was horny! - Oh, dear. You know what, I don't know his name? But he was great in bed. Satisfied? - What? A... Angela. Actually, I can't believe she'd cheat. If you'd seen him you might. He's young, fit... young. And all because we had our first row. Oh, dear, do you have any more booze? I did have some whiskey. Maybe you should have had your first row before you got engaged. If we had, we might have not got married. That's sort of my point, Adam. Amaretto? That's pish. - Go on, then. Angela loves you. I know that she does. There's got to be more to it than that. Well her fiery temper, a drunken bender, his... chiselled abs. It's a lethal cocktail. God, it doesn't say much for the state of your marriage, if that's all it takes. You volunteer for the Samaritans, don't you? Mm. On the helpline. Have you lost many clients? Hm. Maybe I should just get pissed. Hm? It's a bit late for that. Go out on the pull like she did. Why shouldn't I? You're very attractive, Tina. You're very drunk, Adam. But in the morning, I'll still be very attractive. What's your man got going for him? My man? - Your married man. Surely, you could do better than that. Well, as compliments go, that's... back-handed. Does it bother you that he's got a wife? Huh? Does she know, by the way? - I think you've had enough. You are very attractive, though. Hey, Angela. Hi, Matt. Have you seen your dad this morning? He's not answering his phone. - No, I think he's still in bed. Hang on. We had a stupid row last night. I'm not sure he's talking to me. Yeah. He's er... He's fast asleep. When he wakes, I'll tell him you called. Please. Ask him to ring me. Sure you got everything you need? - No, I'll get the rest later. Oh... Are you all right? Yeah, I'm OK. Oh, shit. I know. I know. Wait. Oh, God. Sorry. Bloody Sheila! Mmm! You know, David, if you'd been a cook when we were married, we might have had a few more years before we got divorced. I'm doing coq au vin. I thought the four of us might eat together. A little thank you for taking me in. I'm going out I'll get it. - Oh, course. Yes. You look lovely. I don't have to. Will it stretch to five? Five? David. Karen said you would be here. Ah, she didn't tell me you would. You don't mind eating in, do you? Oh, not at all, judging by the aroma. Err I do still have to leave for London later. Well, best not distract the chef. You look lovely. Thank you. Let me get you a drink. - Gin and tonic. There you go. He seems to be bearing up. Oh... It's a bit up and down. I'll be glad when this is over, to be honest. Sheila? I've been trying to get you! You should be at Mum's. Well, how do you know I'm not? Because I am. - Well, that's all right, then. Er, no. According to the rota, it's your turn. Well, it's not written in stone, is it? Or you couldn't have Blu-Tacked it to the fridge. Do you see? Look, tell Mum I'll see her later. OK? Right now, I'm at a funeral. Pity it's not bloody Sheila's. Dad always used to perk up when he knew you were coming. I always looked forward to seeing him. It was a shame you couldn't visit more often. As my sister was saying, erm... we er... appreciate err... what you did for him. What's that for? - By way of a thank you. I don't want your money! Is that why you thought I came? - No. We didn't mean to insult you. - Your Dad was a fine man. But I'm just here to pay my respects! Right? Lovely do. Nice to see you both. When you say you'll come, you should come. This isn't a fashion choice, all right? I was at a funeral! So you knew you couldn't make it. - Well, I'm here now! Too late to get her lunch! I had to do that. - I can manage. Can you stop treating her like she's an invalid! - She is! God, you're like that Cathy Bates in Misery! You've always lacked empathy! You used to tear the heads of my dolls. Oh, my god, not the Barbies again! You don't pull your weight. I do dentist, doctor, chiropodist. You want her to be dependent on you, don't you? Gives meaning to your sad little life. Anyway she won't be able to- Stop it, the both of you! If your poor father could hear you now... He always hoped you'd be friends. Give it time, I'd say. Look at you. He'll be turning in his grave. I want you to leave. See you later, Mum. So you've met Ryan Reynolds. Oh, no, only once. We were on the same table at err this charity gala. That is so cool. No, to be honest I had him confused with Ryan Gosling. Well, I doubt dad's heard of either of them. I'm not sure that Eddie knows which one played Deadpool. I met Boris Johnson once. I'll give him your regards. Er... that's who I'm meeting in London. This is delicious coq au vin, David, thank you. So who else do you know? Well, the most impressive man I ever met was Nelson Mandela. Oh, I was in this fundraiser in Los Angeles a couple of weeks ago with er Leonardo Dicaprio. I must say, I was surprised when you rang. I wasn't sure we were speaking. And for you. Actually, this was Pete's idea. Ugh... So how did it go? Saint Sheila of Heaton bloody Moor. Honestly, she's never had kids or a husband. She's got more time on her hands than she knows what to do with it. Whoa, whoa, Jen, love. Calm down. You're missing the point. Sheila doesn't expect you to do more. She just wants you to notice how much SHE does. Well, half of it doesn't even need doing! Jen, all Sheila wants is to be appreciated. That's it. Cake? Or are you on a diet? I'm on a health kick. Erm... gluten-free chocolate gateau, please. With cream. Two forks. Two slices. So, wanted to apologise, did you? About your Barbie's? I think we should let that go, don't you? No. I wanted to say thank you for everything you do for Mum. Look, if you weren't around, if you lived in Australia, say... honestly, I don't know how I'd manage. Apology accepted. - I'm not apologising. I am saying thank you. So your dig about my sad little life... Hm... Sorry. - It's not easy being me, Jenny. On my own. I won't lie to you, it's been a test of my faith. My comfort is knowing that God had other plans for me. To devote my life to the service of others. You work part-time in a call centre. On the help desk. There you go again, always putting me down. Your life's perfect. You're not an Old Maid. You're not barren. Crying. Oh, Jen, love, what is it? Pete's depressed. And my babies, they're teenagers. And the mortgage, that's a constant worry. And, listen, I do my best. But it's all on my shoulders, isn't it? And there's only so much that you can take. Honestly, I can't take it anymore. Oh, my poor, sweet girl. Why didn't you tell me? Right, don't you worry about Mum. I'll make other arrangements. - No. I want to do my bit. You have to put yourself and your family first. Oh, I wish you'd told me sooner. Here, have some sugar. They've forgotten the cream. Do you want a brew? - Er... no, thank you. Have you called Angela? Er... you've already passed on that message, son. A couple of days ago. Dad, where were you the other night? Your bed wasn't slept in. Excuse me? - Where were you? I was at Tina's if you must know. What happened? You want to know what happened? No. You are very attractive, though. Are you coming on to me? What would you do if I was? If I thought you'd feel anything, I'd give you a slap. Why, because I'm married? We know that doesn't stop you. Come here. Arsehole. Ugh. Tina? I passed out. Spent the night on Tina's floor. And in the morning... Sorry. Swore off the booze. Which lasted until Harry's wake. I know you and Angela have fallen out, but not talking, it's just being stupid. You are a very sweet boy. I blame your mother for that. Are you going to call her? So how's David taken to having Eddie around? Politely. I don't think he's keen. Yeah, well, he won't like having to share a bathroom, I'm sure. Shared his toothbrush once. You wouldn't believe the fuss he made. But Eddie hasn't stayed over yet. I thought the girls knew about him. But I don't want them being spectators. Nor David, for that matter. Well, him and Pete are going to cinema tomorrow night. Yeah, the girls are out too. And er Eddie happens to be in town. What have you got planned? Eh? A little full-contact yoga? He did offer to show me some Bikram. Hot yoga. I'll bet it bloody is. So, go on. Spit it out. Is he any good? - Advanced. He could teach if he wanted. - Really? Oh, you're still on yoga, aren't you? Yeah, I didn't mean that. - Yeah, I know what you meant. OK, he's clearly nothing to write home about? If you say so, Jen. Seriously? Eddie is crap in bed? Well, that's Jen's interpretation. She said Karen was being coy, but thinks she's just too embarrassed to admit it. Well, she would be. Yeah, that Eddie's a dud. Apparently, they're already thinking of ways to spice things up. Pilates or something. I'm not supposed to tell you this, but I thought it'd cheer you up to know. Oh, it does, Pete. So what did Jenny say exactly? I've just told you. Tell me again. Dad? Call for you. Matt? - No. You've been avoiding me. - Are you surprised? Matt. Can you get the door please? It was all a misunderstanding. I'm not saying it was all my fault. I have to get this. Matt? Surprise. I panicked. I thought if I told you the truth you wouldn't believe me. I didn't. - But you believed I would have sex with some random guy. Why did you tell me that? Because it seemed like that's what you wanted to hear. I was mad with you. So mad that, had Jerry been straight, the thought might have crossed my mind. I know what you mean. Adam... I don't think were gona make it through the next four months. We need to be together. We're no good when were apart. We've tried it here. It didn't work. What about Matthew? He's fine now. He'll manage, we won't. Adam, I'm flying home tonight. If our marriage is to survive... I think you need to be on that plane with me. Hello? - Pete? New client for you love. Right. - Needs help with personal care and she's expecting you. It's Chorlton. Do you know it? Yeah, my mother-in-law lives out that way. - Tavistock Road. Yeah, that's right. - Er... number 72. Right. Peter, love, it think it might be better if someone else comes tomorrow. Reading my mind, Barbara. Reading my mind. Very good. David? I thought you'd gone to the cinema. Oh, we missed the start. I can't abide that. Gosh, it's rather hot in here. What's the thermostat set to? David. I control the temperature. Eddie. You can't stay away, can you? David. - Can't you go for a walk or something? No, don't mind me, I'll be fine. You two enjoy yourselves. Come on. If you can. Hiya. I've left you a hundred messages. - I forgot to charge my phone. Well, what is the point of you have...? Never mind. Where's Angela? - On her way to the airport. Listen, we need to talk. Come here. Oh, poor Mum. - Poor Mum? What about me? You deserve Unsung Hero Of The Year Award, frankly. Well, except there isn't one. By definition. - True. Good news never comes in an expensive envelope. Old Chinese proverb. Eh? What is it? - Jen. Harry's left me some money in his will. It's £50,000. Holy Shit! Language. Shit. Dad, I've loved having you here, but you don't need to stay. Karen will have me back, I'm sure... if I promise to behave myself. You don't need to worry about me. I like my school. I've got friends. I'm not gonna screw up my exams. - I know I know you're not. But what then? After your GCSEs? - My A-levels, I suppose. So you'd want to stay here? Here feels like home. But we can talk online. Not like we used to. We didn't know each other properly then. - What, you think we do now? I reckon I've got a pretty good handle on you. Would you rather that I went? Gave you some space. Ohh! Oh! Oh! I thought you weren't coming. I'm not. It's Matthew. We could talk online like he said, and it would be better, but but it's no substitute for being with him. For most of the last three years I haven't, and in another three he's gona be 18, and I won't have no claim on him. This is our time. His and mine. We need to spend it together. Is that what he wants? Would you rather that I went? Gave you some space? Dad, I'm a teenager. I think you're gonna have to decide this one. I hope its what he wants. And it's the right thing to do. Why did you come? Because I owe you an explanation. I love you, Ange. But you love him more. He's my son.
