 MUSIC: 'Love & Hate' by Michael Kiwanuka Sorry. It must be horrible. # Standing now # Calling all the people Here to see the show # Calling for my demons Now to let... # I thought it was you. Me? That's what they told me. I thought you were dying. Oh, that must have been awful for you. Worse for me. Worse for Barbara. Yeah.

 A cerebral what? A cerebral aneurysm. We were told it was a stroke. It's more of a brain bleed. She's going to be all right, though, isn't she? She is still here, you know. I keeled over on the dance floor. Heather thought I was pie-eyed. Pot calling kettle. I think I should call our Sheila, Mum. Oh, no, don't do that. Shh. There's no need. Tell them, Doctor. We'll be monitoring you very closely, Barbara. In some people, there's a small chance of a recurrent bleed. The first 48 hours are critical.

 I think Sheila would want to know, Mum. Oh, I'm sure she would. There's nothing she likes more than a hospital drama. But this isn't one. Leave it, love. Jane, I am so sorry. How is she? She's gonna be OK. See for yourself in a minute. What, are they doing tests? No, she's putting her lippy on. Hang on. She's ready to receive her public. Oh, you had me so worried, Barbara. I've been beside myself. You look wonderful. You really do. Do you want a hand? No, I have to learn. You can lend a hand with the bags. What happened to you? Sprained ankle. Seriously? Yes, seriously sprained. Practically broken. SHE CHUCKLES Ooh, aren't you strong? That's going to my gym, that is. How are we going to get there now, boss? I can still work on my upper body, so we'll Uber it. Liv, you're back? Just last night. While you were away. Hello, darling. Grandma. I'm spending the day in court. Watching Toby in action. Who's Toby? Liv's friend. Colleague. He's Robin's junior. I should go. I'll walk you to the tram. No, it's fine. Hey, come for dinner sometime. Liv. Wait up. David. Deborah. Welcome. I'm so glad you decided to join us. It's a chance to make a difference. Yeah. You do know what it is we do here at the bank? It's the usual investment advice. Bonds, gilts, equities. We print money. Any fool could do it. But society is changing. Isn't it? Obscene profit is no longer enough. The shareholders, they expect us to show that we contribute back to society. Surely not at the expense of obscene profit? God, no. No. No. In addition to. Which presents us with a challenge, and you with the opportunity. Now, David, this... this will be your office. Right. I'm excited to start work. Good. Great. Go change the world, David. Hey. Oh, my God, what's happened to you? Climbing accident at the weekend. You're a climber? Yeah. Mainly the higher peaks. Scafell Pike. Scafell? That's a walk, isn't it? Anyway, I'm... I'm not allowed to put any weight on it. I've been signed off work for the next couple of weeks. So, hang on, you've come in to work to tell us you're not well enough to come into work? No, I used the doctor's downstairs. PHONE RINGS Excuse me. Hello. 'Adam, your mobile is off.' Are you still free for lunch? Um, no, David. It's my ankle, remember. I have to keep it elevated. You could use a bar stool. Can I call you back later? So, where were we? I was wondering how I'm going to cope without my head of IT. And you were arranging your social life. No. PHONE RINGS RINGING CONTINUES 'Adam, it's Laura.' Laura, hi. I didn't expect to hear from you. 'Can we meet?' Look, look, I'm gonna call you back in just a couple of minutes, OK? We won't hold you up. You're busy. No, no, no, no, no. I'm going home to recuperate now. Actually, could I... Could I book a cab on the company account? Yeah. Thanks. JENNY CHUCKLES Yeah, sprained not broken. Meanwhile, Pete is probably gonna get hypothermia. Mum, are you listening? I've got a bit of an earwig. You what? I can't... Mum? Mum? Mum, are you...? OK. ALARM Oh, Jesus. Nurse. Hello, Nurse, she just collapsed. Her eyes went funny. Can you hear me, Barbara? I'm just gonna shine a light in your eyes. Can you hear us, Barbara? Her pupils are fixed and dilated. I'm just gonna lean you back, Barbara, OK? Barbara, I'm going to listen to your chest. Mum? Barbara? CLINKING FROM KITCHEN I was trying to be as quiet as a mouse. I know you don't like to be disturbed. You're welcome to pop in for a chat, you know, Mum. Really? Bit my head off last time I did. Overreacted. A little. I was so upset, you know, when I thought you were dying. Well, I should hope so. Not as upset as Jenny was, though, when she found out it was Barbara. Oh, that's Jenny for you. Histrionic. I've never been comfortable with overt displays of emotion. Or affection. Don't see the point myself. But if it would make you feel better, start by being a bit nicer to me. BEEPING Say something to her, eh. Why? Well, she might be able to hear you. I love you, Grandma. I don't want you to die. Maybe not that. PHONE BUZZES JENNY SIGHS Pete, have you got her yet? 'We're on our way, Jenny.' Is Mum still with you? Yeah, yeah, she is. Look, I think you should talk to her now, Sheila. Just in case. Hang on. Mum. It's Sheila. 'I'm coming. 'All right. 'Just... 'hang on in there. Thank you. Er, change. Oh, keep it. Charity? Delivery charge. I'm glad you called. I hadn't intended to. I'm sorry I ran off the other night. I shouldn't have. No. I... I threw you in at the deep end. Is that why you're here? To apologise? No. Why does Matt want to see me? I didn't know he did. Oh. Well, he rang me at work and I'm meeting up with him tonight. Hmm. I'm so sorry, Sheila. She's... She's gone. You can go in if you want. I'm so sorry. I know. Shame, eh? Mm. No. I'm OK. I'll be OK. # Babe, you're so special... # You do know your three o'clock is here? My what? Appointment. Don't you check your diary? There's nothing in it. Uh-uh, wrong. Mr Marsden. Rosemary Marshall. Ms Marshall, yes, of course. Let me find you a chair. Roger. Who is she? I'm not your PA, David. She's your three o'clock. Appointment. Well, obviously. Why is she here? To interview you for a business magazine, about what you do. I don't do anything yet. Then it shouldn't take you too long, should it? Good luck. Shalimar. I bought her a bottle every year for her birthday. Oh, I can't sleep in her room. You can have my bed, Auntie Sheila. I'll be all right on the couch. Ah, thanks, love. Do you remember her last words? "I've got a bit of an earwig." I think she meant "headache". Well, as last words go, I do feel "earwig" is the more memorable. Was it very sudden? Yeah. Yeah, it was. Well, sort of. She'd been in hospital since the weekend. But we thought she was gonna get better. She wouldn't let me call you. Said that she didn't want to worry you. And I wish I had now obviously. Well, that was Mum, wasn't it? Always putting others first. You mustn't blame yourself, Jen. My role within the bank is to think outside the box. To build a consensus, so that we can shift the needle of social accountability. And... And it's all bollocks, isn't it? I'm sorry? Meaningless buzzwords. Corporate claptrap. Well, it's perfect. I'm thinking about this for the cover. God, that's depressing. Well, what would you like to talk about? I don't know. I suppose it's that... success needn't be just about profits. There must be other ways of measuring it. I'll give you a story. Last week, I climbed Scafell Pike with a couple of friends. We didn't reach the top. In fact, we nearly died. But I feel that what we gained was so much more than if we had reached the summit. If you see what I mean. Do you remember those dinner parties you used to throw, Mum? I used to love helping you with those. I was a great entertainer. My fondue nights were legendary. What's fondue? Melted cheese on lumps of bread. Eurgh, that sounds disgusting. It was. Perfect for me, cos I couldn't cook. You should do one here. You could help me. I think I could still cut bread. Great. PHONE RINGS Jen? Everything all right? You shouldn't overtrain. You'll injure yourself. Says the man on crutches. Somebody rang for you, a woman. Amelia? Amber. I said you were at the gym. What? She said she'd call back. Just say it's rehab. Barbara's died. Morning. How did you sleep? I don't know if it's jetlag or grief. Probably both. Still, I put the time to good use. I've planned her funeral. I beg your pardon? I thought we'd start with 'The Lord Is My Shepherd'. Such a beautiful hymn. Put you down for a reading. I'll do the eulogy. Obviously, elder sister. But she always wanted Frank Sinatra. Did he record 'The Lord Is My Shepherd'? It's all a bit religious, this, isn't it? Well, of course it is. But she wasn't religious. She was! She went to church every week without fail, all the years we lived together. For you. She didn't want to upset you. When she moved here, she always said the best thing about Sundays were her lie-ins. She didn't go near church. The Reverend O'Hara will preside. Mum loved her sermons. No, no. We're gonna sit down and agree a funeral service together. Fine. Then I propose we start with 'The Lord Is My Shepherd'. Right, next. Readings? She is a nightmare. Total control freak. Not like you at all. I hate it when the bits of bread get stuck in the bottom. As the actress said to the bishop. More wine, David? Thank you, Heather. I wasn't allowed to put any in the fondue. In my day, it was the main ingredient. No wonder your parties were such a hit, eh? Maybe that's got something to do with the hostess. Creep. You could learn a thing or two. And that is how you do it. ..sake. I really loved your mum. You were so close, weren't you? That's how I hoped to be with my girls. It inspired me to make more of an effort with my mum, you know. Well, looks like it's going pretty well. Yeah. Tonight's been really special. Reminded me of when I was little. LAUGHTER She was always so glamorous. Poised. Sophisticated. I just wanted to be her. Oh, God. My mum was never poised. She was a laugh though, to be fair. She used to play with us in the garden. And we had this huge blackberry bush. Jenny, don't eat them all. It'll make you sick. And fat. Sheila was a right old bag, even then. Jen, she wasn't with your mum at the end. Maybe this funeral is a chance for her to say goodbye. Get some closure. A toast, I think. Oh, yeah? To Barbara. Barbara. Barbara. Aw, to you, Mum. Go on, go on, go on. Go up, yeah. Got it. Yeah. I'll go up five K for the last set. How much were you benching last week? About half that. Bloody hell. Oh, Matty. "Matty?" So... did you have a good time the other night? The other night? Yeah. You went out with someone. You didn't say who. Oh, yeah, nobody. Liv. Really? Olivia? Yes. Are you going to spot me or what? Yeah, yeah. Ready? Up. It's yours. MATT EXHALES Jesus. We can do the funeral service the way you want, OK. What's brought this on? Mum just wouldn't want us scrapping over it, that's all. Well, thank you. I've had a few estimates. I think this is the best. Blimey. Ooh. Not cheap, is it? But your mum will pay, I suppose. Well, ultimately, but her account is frozen until probate is completed. And we have to pay upfront. I thought we could go halves. We've got enough in our savings account, haven't we? Mm. The Reverend O'Hara has agreed to officiate. Great. Look, I have got one request. I want to carry Mum's coffin. You? Well, not on my own, obviously. That's not a woman's role. Oh, for God's sakes. Pete, tell her. I knew you'd have to make it about you. What is that supposed to mean? You've always been jealous of my relationship with Mum. Rubbish. That's why you kept it from me that she was dying. What? No, I didn't. It just happened. I don't believe she didn't want you to call me. Now, Sheila, come on. You didn't want me there. You poisonous old cow! Jen, please. And she thought you were a waste of space. Rued the day she ever married you. Ah! This is MY house! Get out! Oh, don't worry, I'm off. Maureen said I can stay with her. She understands Christian values. Amen! Do we still have to pay half? Pete. It's Sandra. We were on jury service together. Sandra, so sorry. I was miles away. Yeah, you look like you lost a pound and found a penny. Well, I've lost the pound and I've not found anything. Oh, dear. Do you... Do you want to talk about it? I quite fancy a coffee. OK. Great. Great. Well, if it isn't Sir Edmund Marsden. What's your next expedition? North face of the Arndale? Eh? You're quite the poster boy around here. Blimey. "Middle management is mostly mediocre." It's good alliteration, David. "But that's what you get when you reward..." Did you really say that? I didn't think she'd use it. I was just sounding off. In that working-class accent of yours. "Positive discrimination is the only way to address "the imbalance of opportunity." I'm sure our white, Old Etonian board will love that. Oh, David. I've just been with the board of directors. Well, it won't take you long to clear your desk. They couldn't be more thrilled. What? Oh, for Christ's sake. It's just the kind of message we need to project. They're going to diversify the board? Yeah. It'll be tokenism. One appointment. But I think there's a fair chance it might be me. You're unbelievable, you know that? Yeah, it's illegal to withdraw money after someone's died. You know more about it than I did. Needs must. My husband died at 46. Oh, my God, I am so sorry. And here's me banging on. Well, the sun still rises and sets. So, you haven't got the money? Well, I did, but I gave it to charity. See, me and friends were fundraising, but they raised more than me, and I hate coming last. Despite the practice. So, how much did you put in? 500 quid. Blimey, pride doesn't come cheap. Oh, I know, what a mug, eh? And I thought I could pay it back without Jenny noticing. She's gonna kill me when she finds out. Yeah. SHE SIGHS Oh, for goodness' sake, Matt. Here you are. Oh, look, really, Sandra, I can't. I'm not giving it to you. It's a loan. Well, even so, if I paid you back, it would only be in dribs and drabs. That doesn't matter. It would just be sitting there earning bugger-all interest. Pete, we're in the middle of Manchester. Take it before we get mugged. Thanks. You're welcome. Could it be insulin? He's not diabetic. No, I know. I'm clutching at straws. He's smoked weed in the past. Oh, so now he's graduated to heroin? No, that's not Matt. Where would he get it from? Oh, fuck. Laura. Laura? Her ex is a drug dealer. Hiya. All right? Why have you been going through my stuff? Forget that, Matt. How long have you been on it? I've only just started. So it was Laura who gave it to you? Laura? Do you know anyone else who can get their hands on heroin? That's not heroin. What is it then, Matt? Anabolic steroids. You've been injecting steroids? Steroids? It's just to help me gain muscle. I'm tiny. Are you worried about Liv? She keeps going on about Toby from Robin's chamber. You know, how fit he is, he plays rugby. So I thought if I bulk up a bit, she might not look at him. What about using this stuff? It turns your balls into walnuts! What, and Laura is peddling this stuff? No, I got it from some guy at the gym. Why do you keep going on about Laura? Because you met her. MATT SIGHS Why? I wanted to ask her about Mum. Look, Laura is the only one that knew her as Mum. I didn't. And what did she say? It was 20 years ago, Matt. Anything. OK... I stayed with your mum and dad one weekend. A practice run. And your mum told me a story. The Little Prince. And she curled a lock of my hair... ..round her finger I fought against falling asleep. Because I didn't want it to ever stop. MATT SNIVELS Thanks. I can just imagine Rache doing that. Oh, Matt, son. Come here. I love you. See this stuff? You get off this right away. Yep. I thought that might go best with your black skirt. For Barbara's funeral. Yes, I'm not going. When you reach my age, funerals aren't much fun. They are not a barrel of laughs for anyone, are they? It's a bit too close to home. Speaking of which, Carlos and his German tourist are no more. He's seen sense. Well, she's gone back to Bonn. And he's begged me to return. And you're gonna go? Well, there's a cheap flight tomorrow morning. Is that why you want to skip Barbara's funeral? This is the last seat at this price. Well, what about us? What do you mean? Well, we've been getting on so well. I mean, what about dinner the other night? The fondue? I thought we were finding our way to some kind of reconciliation. Oh, darling, that's just psychobabble. The sort of rubbish you find in those self-help books you publish. I don't publish self-help. One evening of melted cheese doesn't change anything. We are fine. I love you. Always have. But I've got a life of my own. This is the last seat at this price. Please don't go. Do you ever think you could have been a better mother? I know I do. You're a perfectly good mother. You could loosen up a bit. I've told you that. And I was, too. I mean, I must've been. Look at the way you've turned out. I might have a cup of tea if you're making one. BREAKING GLASS DOWNSTAIRS FLOORBOARDS CREAKING DOOR BANGS Hello? I know someone is in here! I warn you. I'm an exponent of Jeet Kune Do. MAN: David? Hai! Get out! Get out! David! I warn you! What did you say? David. Shit, Robbie! Oh, Christ, you frightened the life out of me. What are you doing? I suppose that's self-explanatory. You're stealing from me? I didn't know this was your place. Until just now. Oh. Was it when I said, "Jeet Kune Do"? Actually, it was "exponent" that tipped me off. Ah. Honestly, if I'd have known, I'd have gone three doors down. Slim pickings there. Well, you're not much better. The till? Oh, Robbie, you old-fashioned lag. It's mostly contactless now. Well, since you're here, cup of coffee? On the house. You're not gonna call the dibs? What, grass you up? Thanks, David. So, panel beating business not going too well? No. I've had a few bumps along the way. I bet you have. It's tough out there at our age. Still, you're doing all right. Oh, my daughter runs this place. I've just got a new job. It's... an investment bank. I made a bit of a mess of your back door. I'll drop by in the morning and fix it. Oh, thanks. Cake? Great. You want an assistant? But you don't do anything. You've noticed that, have you? Well, you're not meant to, but you do it extremely well. I mean, the board are still buzzing about your interview. Well, they'll love the follow-up, when I whistleblow that this firm has no real interest in diversity. What? So, what I want is a budget which allows me to draw up proposals on how to make the bank more egalitarian. Er... And I know the perfect candidate. He's done lots of jobs in banks. Robbed loads of them. You can't bring a bank robber to a bank, David. Oh, don't worry, he wasn't very good at it. Got away with just a fraction of what people here fiddled on expenses. Well, he's done his time. And think of the PR value. It's a story of second chances, of redemption. Of the caring face of capitalism. BELL RINGS You OK? I can't do it. What? I can't carry her. No-one asked me. They just assumed... I can't do it. Hey, hey, hey. Don't worry. What would your gran say? She can't say anything. She's in that box. She'd say... "Let me out." She'd say, "Son, "I know you love me. "You've got nothing to prove." Here, take this. Are you sure? Yeah. You look after your sister. Thank you. He's all right. Yeah. The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. His mercies never come to an end. They are new every morning. Great is his faithfulness. Blessed are those who mourn. ORGAN PLAYS For they will be comforted. # The Lord is my shepherd # I'll not want # He makes me down to lie # In pastures green # He leadeth me # The quiet waters by. # My mum was born into a family of six kids. She never had much, growing up. And neither did we. But her marriage to our lovely dad, Bernard, was a happy one. Summers were her favourite time. Six whole weeks of picnics, trips to Southport with my dad... This looks really sharp. It looks super with your tie. Thank you. You look gorgeous. Mummy. Mummy. Not now, darling. It's Mummy's grown-up time. But, Mummy... If you don't leave me alone, you'll go to your room! Sorry about that. SHEILA: 'Camping in the garden.' Rainy day baking. The four of us together. Are you OK? You all right? We've got this, yeah. Erm... My mum was... Look, she was a good mum. Basically. Which is harder to achieve than I'd reckoned on. Sorry, guys. Last year, as some of you know, I was diagnosed with cancer. She said that no mother should have to go to her own child's funeral. That she really wanted to die first. Well, Barbara, as usual, you got your own way. But, honestly, Mum, thanks for that. And... thanks for the endless cups of tea, and the endless love. I'm gonna miss you. I'm really gonna miss you, Mum. You all right? OK. Hey. Hello. You here with your mum? No, Jen, she didn't feel up to it, but... ..she sent her condolences. Sorry. It was lovely what you said up there, Jen. It really made me think. I'm so sorry. It's OK. Ta. MUSIC: 'Something' by Frank Sinatra Can we visit Portmeirion? Where you scattered Mum's ashes. I hadn't forgotten. You know, cos I've never been. I'd like to go. I'd like to take you. Here, let me do that. I'm sorry we fell out, sis. It's been a stressful time. Does that mean you're sorry an' all? I'm sure we both are. Oh, stay tonight, will you? Really? Because, between you and me, Maureen is a nightmare. Completely inconsiderate of others. Mum... can I have a word? Yeah. I'm sorry... if I haven't been very considerate lately. Moving out to Robin's. If I'd known you weren't going to uni, I'd have never allowed it. Mum, I hadn't thought about it from your point of view. And... ..now that my room is free, I think I'd quite like to come home. And you know, you... you are still my best friend. And Ellie is too. Well, not best. PHONE RINGS Hello. Hiya, Pete, it's Sandra. 'Oh, hi, how are you?' Yeah. I was ringing to check if you're all right. I'll just take this in the other room. Work. 'Back in a minute, love.' Hello. Sandra? Did you just tell your wife that I'm "work"? Well... I don't want her asking any questions... about the money. Yeah. So... are you all right? 'Yes.' You saved my bacon. Thank you. You've said thank you already. Well, look, if there's anything I can do for you... Well, as it happens, I've just bought a new TV. One of those smart ones. Turns out it's a lot smarter than me. I can't find any channels. 'Oh, I'm sure I can help with that.' I thought you were avoiding me. What gives you that idea? The three phone calls you didn't return. Matt told me about your meeting. That was lovely what you said to him about Rachel. I made it up. I don't remember her that well. It seemed like the sort of thing I would want to hear if I was him. Oh. Well, thank you. I love the fact that you two are becoming friends. No, he asked to see me, that's it. Yeah, but you will become friends, the more you come round for dinner. I'm not coming again. I'm sorry, Adam, I just don't see the point. The point? Well, it's us, isn't it? You know, putting right what went wrong all those years ago. You can't fix my life... any more than you can bring Rachel back. I'm not trying to fix your life. What happened, happened. I am glad to know you weren't turning your back on me. But you turning up now, that doesn't do away with all the years that I was in foster care. The stepdads who wanted more. Laura... I know you feel bad about that. It's something you've got to live with. I am not gonna make you feel better about it. I'm too busy looking after myself. Yeah, but Laura... Adam. I don't want you in my life. Maybe it's a test. Maybe she wants me to fight for her. And not give her up like we did all those years ago. Not everyone needs rescuing, Adam. MUSIC: 'Recover' by Bill Ryder-Jones # The silence is killing me # You came to me for cover # And I let you down... # Ta-da! There you go. 30 channels. Great. And there's still nothing on. Thanks, Pete. Cup of tea? Oh, no, sorry, I can't stop. Really? I was hoping you might. Why, have you got some more jobs that need doing? No, I could have programmed the TV myself if I hadn't needed a pretext. Pete, I'm not looking for any commitment. You've got your life. And I've got mine. Thanks for coming in. Och, it was no bother. Well, obviously it was. But not much, judging by your recent behaviour. Huh? What the f...? You had me followed? Socialising in a cafe. Working out at the gym. Even carrying a coffin at a funeral. Wait, hang on, that was painful. I shouldn't have done it, to be truthful. Not if you hoped to keep your job. I suspected you were skiving. And this is proof. Hang on, hang on, I can explain all this. Notice of your termination with immediate effect. What? And I'd advise you to accept the terms. They're preferable... to being sued for fraud.
