 Lee. Ramona! Well, it's not that bad! Result if you like pink. Let's just hope Lee does. Why are you doing his washing anyway? - Cos he no have a washing machine. No. Why are you doing his washing? He could go to a launderette. What do you think he did before you came along? His last girlfriend probably do it. Come on, it's nice to do things for your man. Did you no do the washing for Mark?

 No, I did not! - Hmm. And that is not why we split up. If you wanna be a doormat, it's up to you but he's not taking advantage of me. No more sweaty pants in my washing machine, OK? Look at that. Just swallow that. Open up. He's dead. No! Who? Mr McGarry, our landlord. Heart attack. Good night. Apparently, he owed a lot of people a lot of money. It's why the house is up for auction. But what about us? - Doesn't include contents. Auction's on the 12th, so people are gonna start coming round to look at it soon.

 Oh, great! Aye, but, Rach, look, this is an opportunity. We've been renting here for the last five years. That's dead money. It's time we bought. Well, can we afford to? With two incomes? No. But I'm sure we can manage. How much do you think it's worth? Agent reckons they'll get 250. No way. It's Didsbury, it's a popular place. I live here. But it's only got two bedrooms. - It'd be nicer to have three rooms. So we might have to move a bit further out. Or Moss Side. But, you know, you get more for your money. Bigger garden. What do we need a bigger garden for? - Football. Barbecues. Somewhere to pee when the loo's taken. Well, that's very nice. Peeing in the garden. That's lovely. You've sold it to me. It beats the kitchen sink. I don't want to move. We like living here, don't we, sweetheart? Rachel... We can't afford it. It won't go for 250,000 pounds. - We can't afford it! But we can afford somewhere else. Nicer. Of our own. So she's not sold on the idea? No! But soon we'll have no option. We'll be out on the streets. On our arses. You'll talk her round, won't you? Always have done in the past. But that was simple stuff, ex-girlfriends you were seeing on the quiet. This is something else. This is the fundamental difference between the sexes. Any idea what he's on about? - Not a clue. See, men are hunters, we don't care. We could live anywhere. In a cave. As long as there was a telly. But women bond with the home in the same way that man bonds with his pint. That's mine, by the way. Ah! See? Women make homes their nests. That's what they have drawers for everything. Do you know why they know where everything is? Cos they put it there in the first place. Plus, I know where everything is. - Yeah, but 250 grand. Yeah, well, that's bloody estate agent talk. Otherwise known as bullshit. I've done the maths, we can go up to 200. What if it goes higher? Well, then we'd be stuffed. I think even at 250, it's still a good buy. You think so? - Hmm. Yeah, think about it. Right. Take what you're paying in rent... ..over 25 years, allowing for inflation. How do you know what I'm paying in rent? You told me once. I don't forget figures. Compare that with a 90% mortgage over the same period. OK, that doesn't work. Suppose then you have only a 50% mortgage. That wouldn't be enough. With the potential rental income, and a modest rise in property prices... Phew. Well, it beats the stock market. That's very helpful. Another drink? - Yes, please. So, how are you going without Mark? I'm better off without him. That's what I keep telling myself. Like a mantra. Well, I did meet this really nice guy who works for... No, Jo, I am not interested. Sorry. If the most gorgeous man in the world pitched up on the doorstep now, I wouldn't bat an eyelid. You should go. - No, you go. Don't tempt me. I thought you'd sorted out that immigration thing? Yeah, we have. It's just Pete and I are still miles apart. We're sleeping in separate rooms. I don't know how to bridge the gap. Karen, can you get that, please? - Yep. Hello. Hi. Och, isn't he just beautiful? Just like his mum. - Sorry, can I help you? And you have a lovely house. Oh, the house. You'd better come in. OK, two bedrooms upstairs, upstairs bathroom, kitchen... I haven't come about the house, Rachel. Oh, I'm not Rachel. I think we must have got our wires crossed somewhere. Yeah, tangled more like. You must be Rachel, then? Um, no. Rachel? - Yes? Third time lucky. I'm Bill. Bill? I'm the wee lad's granddad. Well, I take it that is Matthew? I just want me and Jo to be like we were before we were married. You'd best get a divorce, then. You could send her flowers. I know a good florist. Discount for repeat orders. Yeah, but flowers, it's such a cliche. - Cook for her. Women love that. I could do! You know, I do a mean spag bol. Pete, if music be the food of love, spag bol is like a shag behind the bike sheds. Use your imagination. Or failing that, Jamie Oliver's. Do you really think flowers are a cliche? You're going from Dublin to Gothenburg and you were just passing? Mm-hm. Overhead. No, I've business there. I thought it'd be a good opportunity to see my grandson. And my son, of course. Will that be him? I'm drunk and I'm wanting sex! - Yeah. One or all of you will do. Oh, sorry. Hello, Adam. What are you doing here? I came to meet Matthew, of course. And Rachel. Get out. - I was hoping we could talk. We just have. If you've had a drink, maybe this isn't the time... - That was a joke! You mean, the part about sex wasn't? I want you to leave. Maybe we should. I'm sure you've got a lot to discuss. I've nothing to say to him. Sorry to cause a scene. Nice... - Just go! Maybe we should leave. - Not on my account you don't have to. I don't know, maybe... - Just do what you want to do! Let's go. - Yeah, we'll go. It's OK. It's OK, it's OK. Do you think we should stop? Why? Well, because it's rude not to. He might see us. No, he won't. Then again. Hello again. Hi. Do you want a lift somewhere? That's OK. I'll pick up a cab. Not round here you won't. That's a pity. There's a plane I could catch. The airport. OK, hop in. We'll just drop Jo off. Thanks. How did he know about Matthew? Sorry? My dad. He said he'd come to see Matthew. OK. I wrote to him when Matthew was born. - You did what? To tell him that he was a grandfather. I thought he had the right to know. That's nice of you. I don't see you inviting your dad. That's different, Adam. Your dad didn't hit your mum. Anyway, I didn't invite him. You should still have told me. Well, I knew how you'd react. - Yeah? How? Like this! - Do you blame me? No, I don't, but... Honestly, if you could have seen your dad with Matthew... I don't wanna talk about it, Rachel. Hey. Hi. - What's going on? Well, now you're here... the pasta. I was going to do something a bit pukka. But, to be honest, it's out of a jar. It's a peace offering. I just want us to be friends again. Oh, Pete, I'm sorry about the way I've been behaving. It's just that the immigration thing really freaked me out. What's that? Peace offering. Chinese. But we can throw it out. No. No, let's have the lot. Let's have a gastronomic feast. All right. An Epicurean orgy. - Hmm, sounds nice. But we'll do the washing-up first. I'm really sorry about this. I had no idea the flight was going to be full. Well, you wouldn't, would you? Manchester to Gothenburg. Who's gonna do that? The Scandinavian Youth Orchestra, apparently. Look, I don't mind checking into a hotel. Nonsense. I have a spare room, now my husband's no longer in it. Hello, Josh. - Hello, Mummy. Josh, this is Bill. Bill, this is Josh. Hi, Josh. Come on. I'll show you your room. Come on, sweetheart. Oh! Well, hello. I thought we'd play a little game. I'm going to be the naughty lodger who can't pay her rent. And you are going to play the landlord who's come to collect. Right! I like this game. OK. That'll be 85 pounds a week and you put your bins out on Mondays. Ta-ra! Wait! No rogue jock straps in there, are there? Hmm? - We're Lee-free? Oh! Yeah. He not very happy, though. He hate going to the laundry-ette. Oh, he'll get used to it. - I doubt it. I go for him. - Ramona! There's no flight today. Oh, well. It'll give you another chance to make things up with Adam. Maybe you should try the more indirect approach. Rachel? Well, she did write to you, didn't she? No, I don't want to put her between me and him. Surely that's for her to decide? And please don't offend me by offering to book into a hotel. It's chocolates this morning. Oh, God, what a cliche! Put 'em with the flowers. - OK. Robyn Duff, please. Is that the same meeting as earlier? No, just that David Marsden called. Sally, if anyone calls, I'm in a meeting. I thought it was better we met here. Than risk a certain someone seeing us together? I agreed to see you. That doesn't mean I'm in your camp. I just think it'd be better if I had a chance to talk to Adam, put my case. He doesn't want to hear it, Bill. And to be fair, I can understand why. Yes, but... ..it's time he heard the full story. Mr Marsden! Mr Marsden, you can't go in, she's in... What more do you want from me, Robyn? David! - No, no! Hear me out. I have said I'm sorry. And I'll keep saying it until you believe me. I am sorry! Mea culpa and all that. But please! You see, I've realised how much you mean to me. We...you know, we could have such fun together and... What's more, the sex is fantastic! David! Oh. Hello. I'm sorry. Again. I don't see the point of this. Not if we're bidding for our own house. Well, first, we might see something we prefer. And second... ..we can't afford our own house! Come on. How can I help you? We'd like to buy a house. - We're just looking for now. Yeah... - Anything in mind? Pretty easy, three bedrooms... - Didsbury. Or thereabouts. - Near the shops. But a nice, quiet neighbourhood. And what's our price? 180. - To 200. Is this Chas? Chas? Chas Mabbutt. We're always winding each other up. This is a wind-up? Robyn! That, David, is a non-molestation order, signed by a magistrate. You come within 500 yards of me without my permission, I'm gonna hang you up to dry by your bollocks. No buts. You're a pest, David. A nuisance to women. See you later. See you. - See you. I'm really looking forward to this weekend. Really? Why? - Birmingham. The new club opening. Oh, shit! I wonder if I can get out of it. What? It'll be fun. What, selling fitness to a load of overweight Brummies? That's just during the day. There's a whole crowd of us going. - I'd rather stay at home with Pete. They're putting us up in a great hotel. Oh, go on! It'll be a laugh. And they're paying double bubble. Really? Now, are you sure I didn't cost you your job? Well, for a moment, I thought you had. But I think you rather did me a favour. Hmm? - It's not a bad reputation to have. You're making me jealous already. So, are we officially an item now? How do you go about making it official? By telling your wife about me? I don't think that's a good idea. Maybe not. - Hang on. The market in Didsbury's strong. You're thinking about moving? No, buying. Mmm! What are we having? Oh, a little bit of everything. Suits me. Have I got time for a shower? Oh, yeah. It not ready for at least an hour. Hello. Bazza! A drink? Yeah, hang on. Fancy a swift half with a mate of mine? Hello! I got the food on. Go on, then. You go. Yeah, OK. It'll have to be a quickie. I'll see you there in ten. Thanks, love. I'll just show Mr and Mrs Barlow upstairs. - Yeah, yeah, whatever. 7.99 pounds! Are we having guests? Yes. - Who? Er, Simon. He's a work colleague, new to Manchester. A nice bloke. Works on the Warbouys account. That'll be him, then. Yes, it will. Adam, everything I just said was a lie. I'm sorry. Hmm? No, no, no, no. Rachel, I can't believe you did this. Adam, I really think you should listen to what he has to say. Weaselled your way round her, have you? He always did have a way with women. I just wanna have a talk, son. Don't you call me son! You had the chance years ago but you packed your bags and went. I was heartbroken! I wrote begging you to come back or take me with you, but you didn't reply! I couldn't. - You could have! Your mother wouldn't let me. - Don't you dare try to blame her! I'm not, it's just... Your mother... I don't want to hear it! Whatever you've been told... ..I did not leave your mother for another woman. That's what she said. I don't believe you. It was a man. And this is the kitchen. What? I left your mother because of another man. I left Ireland altogether, in fact. It wasn't easy. We'll be off. You're gay? Bisexual. It's all pretty academic, really. No. This changes nothing. You rejected me when I needed you most. I don't care what your excuse is. There's no excuse for that. I know. I'm going out. Well, it's certainly easier than coming out. Your dad's gay? Blimey! What? What? - Your dad. Gay. Yeah, it's hysterical. Oh, come on, Adam, you've got to see the funny side. What funny side is that exactly? OK, I'm sorry. Look, I don't give a shite whether my dad was gay or not. The point is, he walked out. - For another man. They went abroad because of bigots like you. Hey, hey. - Have you any idea how hard it must have been to be gay in Belfast in the '70s? Both sides gunning for you. Literally. I'm sorry. Yeah, so am I. One message. First new message. Karen, hi. The court needs our marriage certificate. So, can you get it to my solicitor's? It's fairly urgent. Call me if there's any problem. Bye. Is Jo in? Er...no. He's been shagging her all along. Did I mention Jo wasn't in? I feel like such an idiot. She shouldn't be long. Her, of all people! She tried to paint me as an unfit mother! Would you like a coffee? - I mean, listen... He's free to see whoever he wants, that's fine, but really! His divorce lawyer? Are you sure? Of course I'm sure! I saw them in the street! She kissed him on the lips. Maybe he's paying her too well. Well, does it really matter? - Of course it matters! Why? You said yourself that you're both free agents. You just don't like her. And I don't blame you. But that's your problem, not David's. I thought you were making coffee. I must go to the gym more often. I quite like you the way you are. Yeah, I can understand that. Oh, shit, who's that? That's Karen. It might be something to do with the children. Karen, hi. David. Are you OK? Yeah, fine. You sound out of breath. No, I'm at the gym. The gym? I thought you'd given all that up? I had to start again, you know. Needed to. Look, was there a reason you called? Yeah. Um... I just wanted to say that I know about you and Robyn. You do? Yeah, and I'm fine with it. You are? Well, trying to be, yeah. David? Yeah, sorry...I just tweaked something. Right, well, I just wanted to say that I know about you and Robyn. I'm fine with it and um... I hope you're both very happy. Yeah, OK, thanks, Karen. Yeah, I really appreciate that. OK. Bye. Bye. Oh! You are so... I think I just interrupted David having sex. Do these estate agents ever turn up when they say they're going to? Keano! All right, luv? - Hi. Are you up yet, you slag? This is definitely the best you've shown us. The kitchen's nice, the bedrooms are a good size, I can't really see... ..that there's anything wrong with it. Near the airport, too, which is handy. We're thinking of moving in here. - Oh. You'll like it here. Yeah, it's a lovely area. Very safe. That's because Jesus protects us. Are you friends with the Lord? Have you found it yet? I have to sort the map out. Oh, yeah, I've got it. It's just off Park Street. Oh, God... - What? Right next to the prison. This is hopeless. We're never going to find anywhere. And now time's running out. Maybe we're just going to have to rent again. Maybe not. It's got to be worth a look. Oh... This house was sold. Fell through at the last minute. It won't be on the market for long. What about schools? St Luke's up the road and Butter Lane Primary about a mile away, both with excellent academic records. I'll leave you to it, then. Have a chat, and if you need me, I'll be in the sales office round the corner. Thank you. - Thank you. Well, hoo hoo! What do you think? I think it's incredible. - I know! To think that we can afford it. To think that people want to live here. Lots of people would. Adam, I'd rather live next door to those Christians. Rachel! It has everything we've been looking for. We're not gonna do better than this. I think we should keep looking. Well... You heard her. It's not gonna be on the market for long. We're lucky we saw it. It all seems in pretty good order. I wouldn't be living here myself. It's more of an investment opportunity. Well, I can't see you having any problems getting permission for a loft conversion. I thought you said the occupants were out? Don't worry, they're lovely people. I know. Look, you don't know me, OK? - Sorry? Adam! Rachel. - Hello, David. Paul. What brings you here? I was just passing and thought I'd drop by. This chap was already here and he kindly let me in. Waiting for a viewing. But they haven't shown. Oh, I have another appointment, so I'll be off. Nice meeting you. - Yeah. You fancy a coffee, then? I'd love one. Come on, then. Right. The kids are in bed. I'll put supper on. Taken care of. An Irish delicacy. Not potatoes, is it? Well, they might be involved. I just wanted to say thanks for putting me up. You're not thinking of going? Karen, there's not much point in hanging on. Adam's not going to come round. Oh, that be Lee. I see you tomorrow. Bye. Bye. I've just been living in false hope. I'm sorry. It's fair enough. I can hardly forgive myself for walking out. I don't see why he should. You're a stubborn lot, you Williamses. Well, that's something we have in common. Can I ask you something? I'm guessing this has nothing to do with the meal. Bisexuality? I've never been sure. Is it like...everyone's fair game? Well, not the ugly ones. No, it's the person. Not what sex they are. If they're attractive, they're attractive. And what's attractive? Well... ..you have to ask? Sorry. Flirting's always been a weakness. Then you and Adam have got a lot more in common than he'd like to admit. Still leaving me, then? You can always come with me. - A sales rep hotel in Birmingham? I think I'll pass. I'll miss you. I doubt it. - I will. Thank you. - Thank you. Wine? - Mmm. Please. Have you any plans for this afternoon? No. Nothing much on. Why? Did you have something in mind? Mm-hm. It involves you having nothing much on. There's no stopping you, is there? I really like this place, don't you? Yeah. Good food, great wine, my kind of place. But it's got a great atmosphere as well. Good place to bring friends. Then why don't you? What? - Why don't you invite your friends here? Huh? It's about time I met them, don't you think? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, dinner. Yeah, I'll ring round. You'd better warn Karen. We don't want her to think I'm trying to steal them from her, do we? No. OK, so the first thing you need to do is sort out... Right, so that's your temporary membership card. I'll look forward to seeing you down here soon. - OK, thanks. Minibus leaves for the hotel in half an hour. - Oh, great. Not a minute too soon. The bedrooms aren't enormous, but... Once you've got a bed and a wardrobe in, what else do you need? Hi, Karen. Oh, hi, Adam. Rachel's just showing me your new house. It's great, isn't it? I'll go. You know, your dad's really upset? Still making him welcome, are you? Not for much longer, no, he's leaving tomorrow. Good. Isn't there anything you want to say to him? Oh, yes. There's 20 years' worth. I would like to have said it to him then. But, oh, yeah, I couldn't. That's the point! Right, so you're going to carry this anger round with you all your life? What about Matthew? Matthew? You didn't have a father, so he doesn't have a grandfather? Oh, come on! It is hardly the same. Just have a drink with him. One drink, Adam. Trust me. If you don't, you'll live to regret it. He's in The Nag's Head. Where's Adam? The pub. - Oh, great! To meet Bill. OK, hotel bar, ten minutes. What about our room? - Easy, tiger. No, we brought some booze. It's a lot cheaper. Your room, ten minutes. Adam. I'm staying for one drink, and one drink only. I grew up hating you. I still do. I mean, what kind of father walks out on his child? Every blrthday, every Christmas, every time I passed my exams, I kept thinking, ''This year, maybe this year.'' You're meant to enjoy those days. I hated them, cos they brought it home. All the lovely presents. But the one that was missing was the only one I wanted. Didn't matter what it was. Just to have written on it, ''From your daddy. '' What are you having? Are you staying for another? I haven't finished yet. How long has it been now? About an hour and ten minutes. It's a good sign, isn't it? Isn't that a good sign? Well, if they're talking, they're not fighting. Unless they are fighting. I didn't come out as such. Your mother found out. And no-one else knew. It was Ireland after all. She must have felt very humiliated. She didn't want to have anything to do with me. Or me to have anything to do with you. She made me promise. And I'm not blaming her. I mean, I did shame her. But... don't you think I wasn't thinking of you? Every Christmas. Every birthday. Every day. I wrote you so many letters. I just never sent them. Come on! - Nice one! Come on! - Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Yeah! I lived in New York for a couple of years. When? Mid-'90s. Me and Pete went to New York in '94. I was there then. No? Well, it's a big city, Adam. We stayed in a dive near, um... ..Union Square. My apartment was only three blocks from there. No? - Hm. Maybe we passed each other in the street. - Yeah. It must be odd, having a gay dad. He's bisexual. Yeah, whatever that means. - It means he can fancy women, and women can fancy him. No? No, you don't? My God, Karen, he's old enough to be your father. Your gay father. I know. There's something about him. What? The key ring he wears dangling from his waist? No! It's like with older men, what you see is what you get. There are less pretensions. It's like he's beyond all that. Past it, more like. Your friend Karen's a fine-looking woman. Yeah, she's all right. She could do with minding her business a bit more. Don't shoot the messenger. You know she's getting divorced? Aye, so she was telling me. She's very attractive! Yeah, yeah, she is. You're not serious? What? Are you swinging back again? Adam, I did that long ago. Back and forth. But Karen, she's half your age. - I'm not that old. She's not that young. I haven't made a pass or anything. I'm just saying she's very attractive. Do you think I stand a chance? No! Drink! Drink! Get this down you in one go. - Go on. Go on. And an article of clothing. All right but I get to choose what it is. OK, the article of clothing I choose to take off is... Lee's shirt. Yes! Yes! Yes! Cheat! Off! Off! Off! Whoo! Woo-hoo! I should be getting home. Mmm, I don't think I'll wait up. Thanks, Karen. What for? I'm so glad you came tonight. Do you have to leave tomorrow? No. I could stay longer. I am sorry, son. I know, Dad. I love you. Bloody poofs! Come on! Yeah-hey! Piggyback fight! Come on, boys! Off! Off! Off! Yay! OK if I have our room tonight, Jo? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Looks like it's you and me, kid. Yeah. You, me and Jack. Hello. Everything all right? No, it's not all right. Karen, I really need to talk to you. I thought you and Pete were all right now. - We are, that's the stupid thing, you know. Everything's fine. And then, this happens. Who was he? Oh, it was just this guy at the hotel. We were all sitting around drinking and one thing led to another. That's quite a leap. Well, it was quite a lot of drink. Are you going to tell Pete? No. God, I don't know. Maybe I should. What do you think? I can't tell you what to do, Jo. I mean, it was just drink. It's not like I felt anything for the guy. Are you going to see him again? No! I love Pete. This was just madness. Oh, my God. Am I in the right flat? I just thought it would be a nice surprise, you know? Surprise? It's a bloody miracle. You do realise I won't be able to find anything now you've restored order to my chaos. Well, you'll just have to ask me, won't you? I'll know. I'll need you to be here, then, won't I? But I am here. - Not all the time. Move in with me. Lee! Do you mean that? - Yeah. Jo? Hey! - Hi! I missed you. - You should go away more often. No way. Not without you. OK. That is them all. I'll wait for you in the car. - OK. I knew this day would come. As a parent, you prepare yourself. Oh, Karen, you know this not change anything. I still be here every day, seven o'clock. Ramona, you've lived upstairs for five years and I've never once seen you at seven. Mmm. OK, maybe eight. Ish. Listen, the point is that I'm still here for you and the children. Are you sure about this? About Lee? Yeah. Well, I hope it works out. Oh! Oh, thank you. I see you tomorrow. - Eight o'clock. Ish. - Mm-hm. Oh, you, come here. Be good. Hello? Hi. Hi, it's me. I'm just calling...er cos...Robyn and I are organising dinner at Hinchley's restaurant for...our friends. Our friends? Yeah. I'd like them to meet Robyn. Oh, that's nice. When? We thought Tuesday. Mmm, Tuesday would be fine. Are you OK with that? I'm sure Ramona will be able to baby-sit. What time? You're wanting to come? Well, isn't that why you were phoning? Yes, yes, of course. Of course, you'd be very welcome. David, I'm teasing. I don't think Robyn would want me there. No, no, I'm sure she'd be delighted. Have a nice time, David. That was nice. So's this. Do you think I should come off the Pill? Do you want to? Yeah. - Blimey. I just thought it'd be nice, you know. You, me... And Baby Algernon. Well, hopefully, a girl. Either way. A family.
