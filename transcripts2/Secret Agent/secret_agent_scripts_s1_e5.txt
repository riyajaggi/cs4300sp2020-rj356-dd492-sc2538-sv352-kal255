 Please close the door John! Lisa, what's the matter with you? You look as though you've seen a ghost. I'm sorry. I had to come in, I had to. You had to? That's a funny way to speak to an old friend. I couldn't do anything else. Drink? Thanks. But I won't stay long.

 I can't. What's the rush? I haven't seen you in three years. You come bursting in here like the Mad Woman of Chaillot and then you want to go bursting out again. Come on why don't you sit down and relax and tell me all about it? I can't. I don't wanna talk about it. I just don't wanna talk about it. As you like. Skol. Skol.

 Still cooking up the expenses hey? I can't do that anymore. I've no one to charge them to. I left the department John. I'm on my own now. Good for you. What are you doing now? Every time I ask G about you he shuts up like a clam. Well, Skol again. Here's to anyone who can get out of G's clutches. I thought you said that you'd retired huh? Come on, we're old enough friends. You can tell me about it Lisa. It's nothing. Nothing? You're scared out of your wits and it take a good deal to scare you. John, I'm being followed. Hounded. For heaven's sake. No, no, they never let up. They won't leave me alone. Every day, wherever I am, whichever way I turn. They won't leave me alone. Who won't? I don't see anybody. Lisa, I think perhaps you ought to stay around here for a little while? Oh he's out there somewhere. He always is. But who is? What does he want? It's my problem. Look Lisa, please will you allow me to help you? No, I don't want any help from you. Or from Gorton. Or from anyone in your department. I know that Gorton can be pretty tough but for heaven's sake this is-- No please, not Gorton. If you really wanna help me-- Of course I do. Do you have your car outside? Around the back. If I could just lose them. I'll go around the back, make sure there's nobody around that side. You wait here. I'll be back in a minute. Answer that Geoffery. It'll be the minister sir. He was going to ring at the quarter of an hour. Good afternoon sir. Good afternoon. Who is that? Drake. Oh, Drake. Well what do you want? What's all this about Elizabeth Lanzig? Lanzig? What's that to do with you? Are we following her or what? Following her? What are you talking about? Well if we're not, somebody is. Look Drake, the minister will be on any minute. What's this all about? Elizabeth Lanzig is being chased all over London. What? Where is she? In my house. She can't be. Hang on a minute. Minister for Brigadier Gorton. Yes, he's here now. The Minister's office. Well if she is there just keep her there. Don't let her out of your sight. I'll call you back. Sorry to have been so long. He was out there. A tall, dark man, staring under black eyebrows? Yes. Yes, unfortunately he chose that moment to look around the back. He had me pinned down for quite a while. You're a liar. You've called Gorton. Well that's the last thing I'd do. I'm on my way. You're coming in the car with me remember? No, not now John. I don't trust you. But he's still out there. I'll take my chances. I'll tell you what. What? Let's have lunch together huh? Wooten's on Blagdon Street. Oysters, roast duckling, gallons of cool white wine. And I promise not to ask any more questions. Through the dustbins, over the wall. You know, in all the time we worked together you never once gave me a lunch. Not once. -That's because I didn't want to mix business with pleasure. You're a liar. You knew how I felt about you and you were scared. Come on now Lisa. It's a pity because I still feel the same way about you. Sir? I'm having a little trouble with weight. Oh yes the affluent society sir. Yes, that's right. I hear that you're the expert. One can help of course. You must also be self-disciplined. That is the most important thing. Oh now I think we can forget the self-discipline. If you could just make me up one of these 10 day diets. I can recommend a very fine book on the subject of self-discipline sir written by my friend Krishna Sadat, who was also my professor in Delhi. You know you must learn to master yourself sir. The diet itself is not good without the knowledge of how the body works. I think you're right. Maybe I'm wasting my time. Self-control is not in my line. Thank you! You know him? Only too well. He keeps on pestering me. Why? Oh, something personal. He was very inquisitive. It's quite personal. It has nothing to do with our business. Is it ready? What is his job? It really doesn't matter what his job is. Here you are. 50 pounds. Is it ready or not? No. I must have it now. No Miss Scherer, we must be more careful. I don't want any trouble. -If I don't get it I'll have no need to be careful Mr. Sustri. I might start talking all over London. If I don't get it I don't care if there's trouble. Do I make myself clear? Come in Drake. Good afternoon. Where have you been for the last two and half hours? Lisa is still up to all her old tricks. I trust you're not about to tell me that you've lost her. Yes I'm afraid so. And how did the omnipotent Mr. Drake come to do that? I made a fool of myself. And also there was a slight altercation with Special Branch. Special Branch? What are they up to? They wouldn't say. They had me in for interrogation. Oh, did they? Who was this? A man called Foster. Geoffrey, get onto Special Branch. I want their man Foster in here now. You've got some explaining to do haven't you? So have you. What's our interest in Lisa? I thought you'd pensioned her off. Or have you? They're sending Foster over right away sir. Geoffrey, get me that mental hospital on the line. The one where they're treating Lisa Lanzig. Yes I know you don't like the idea of going about and meeting people but you're getting better everyday and you've got to start sometime and I think you'll enjoy it. Oh excuse me. I'm wanted on the phone. So remember Mrs. Bell that's a promise. Tomorrow morning then? Yes Doctor. Good. McKenna here. There's a call from London Doctor. Brigadier Gorton. Ah, good day to you Gorton. Hello Doctor. You know who I'm on about. -- What the devil is she doing out? - What, Lisa? Oh she's doing remarkably well. I thought it was time she got back in the swim. Oh you did, did you? And why wasn't I asked? - Oh, come, come Brigadier. This isn't your own private concentration camp you know. This is a hospital. So you think she's cured? She's a lot better. Lost her persecution complex has she? If that's what you choose to call it, yes. Then why does she still think she's being followed all over London? Hmm. Well in that case I suppose we'd better get her back right away. Where can we find her? We can't, and I hope you realize what you've let us in for. Goodbye! I can see it, I can see it happening all over again. And all because of that blasted Doctor! Special check on London Airport Geoffrey. I want her stopped. It's a pity you kept it to yourself so long if it's as serious as all that. Serious? I'll tell you just how serious It is. She's got one idea in her mind, that woman. She won't rest 'til she's killed Pohlman. Our Lisa? Our Lisa didn't do so badly last time she tried it. She damn nearly pulled it off. Not only got into the heart of east Germany unknown to them, but unknown to us. Within 12 hours flat she was right in to Pohlman's garden. If it hadn't been for that special waistcoat he'd have been a goner. Hard luck. 20 years they gave her. We exchanged her last year for Guttman. Took a lot of doing. I spent months doing that at top level. Pohlman huh? He's come on in the world since he was head of theirsecret service. He's a versatile boy. He's a minister. What's she got against him that the rest of us haven't? He caught her John. Just when she got everything sewn up for us. But she wouldn't say a word. As you say, he's a versatile boy. He was rough. Even by their standards. He'd have done better to kill her. And now she's after him again? I'm sure she is. Special Branch man there yet? Yes sir. Bring him in. Come in Mr. Foster. Now then, what's this all about? You mean about your man sir? No, the woman. Why were you following her? I wouldn't have lost her but for your man sir. Well that's not strictly true. Hello. Oh, it's you. Yes all right, we know you know each other. Now let's get on. Why were you following her? We've been watching this shop. She's been there once or twice so I followed her. And what's going on there? He's dealing in forged passports. We haven't picked him up yet. We are too interested in some of his customers. Mm, quite right. All right you two, get round to that shop or whatever it is and find out what's going on. Shall we? The lady was a very fine client of mine sir. I'll bet she was. Sir. She was most painstaking. And self-disciplined. What else did you sell her apart from watermelon seeds? We sell many foods. Among other things. Passports for instance? British, French, American, German. Which one did she choose? The world is full of unfortunate homeless people. Sometimes one can help. Pays too, doesn't it? Which one? Which one did you sell her? It was Swiss. I made no profit. I know you did it for love. What name? Lisa. Lisa Sherer. Visas? I think one. This one? Or this one? Personally I go for this one. You try to help. They betray you. East German Republic? Plane ticket, East German Marks, and passport. Hmm. Not a bad forgery. Almost as good as Sustri's. Sign here please. You all set Drake? Yeah. Well she is through. Checked into East Berlin 10 minutes ago under the name of Sherer. Why was I picked for this job? You're Lisa's friend aren't you? At least you always took her side against me. Now I'm supposed to be John Sherer, husband of Lisa and she is a Canadian who retained her nationality after we were married. Is that right? Drake if you can't persuade her to come out, see she's handed over to their police. -Lisa? I can't do that. You can Drake and you will. If Lisa kills Pohlman there'll be serious repercussions. Too serious for us to even think about them. Morning. You're here on business Herr Sherer? Yes that's right. You sell machinery huh? Oh no, no. I'm a travel agent. It's in the passport. Oh you hope to develop tourism between our two countries. Can't start things too soon. You realize Herr Sherer that this Visa only lasts for 24 hours? Oh yes indeed. I'll have to get my skates on won't I? Thank you. Taxi? Thank you. Herr Sherer? Karl? Yes, Karl. We only heard the message an hour ago. But we found your wife already Herr Sherer. Quick work eh? You tell them we're pretty good out here. Yeah I'll tell them. What's the address? Goldenerhirsch, Room 27. Small hotel in the..... Take me there and wait. Lisa I want to help you. But I have a family now. I can't take risks anymore for the sake of my wife. All I want to know is where the place is. I know he has a villa or a dacha somewhere in the woods. You have your sources. Please help me. Go home Lisa, forget the past. We know what he did to you. But you've done enough. It's too dangerous. You ever been in one of Pohlman's prisons? No Lisa I haven't. Do you know why? Because Pohlman couldn't make me talk. We know what we owe you. Then tell me where it is. Pieter, he's having me followed all over London. I can't stand anymore! He won't leave me alone! He's got to stop! He's gotta leave me alone! I'm entitled to some peace. Don't you think? You still have some time to get away on that visa. Don't throw away the chance. You won't help me. All right. I'll find it. I must see Pohlman. I honestly don't know where it is. Look, if you give me an hour or two I might get it for you. And we meet at the old place at 12:00, the Cafe Warschau, remember? Thank you. It's John. Hello Lisa. I won't ask you why you're here. But you've come a long way for nothing. I hope not. We want you back home. That really is funny. Home! l have a car outside. We could have you safely out of trouble none the worse inside the hour. We? I then. Gorton's messenger boy. Now Lisa please. Once in the old days you'd have stood up to him. But not now it seems. Lisa you're coming home with me. Is that clear? I want to take you home. Nobody's going to hurt you. Nobody's after you. We just want to-- Get out, get out! Lisa please don't be so-- Mad? Is that what you're going to say? The Brigadier's really done a job. He has you properly brainwashed. Well Doctor McKenna has other ideas. And he's someone who knows. Not like Gorton! They'll catch you. You haven't a chance you know. No, not this time. There'll be other Pohlman's by now. Eliminate one and there'll be a queue. I think you'd better-- Won't there? Yes, other Pohlmans. And other people who are honest and decent to destroy them. Look Lisa, your way... Lisa your way can only lead to killing and to more killing. You can't wipe out blood with more blood! If you cant' see that then at least come home with me because we are your friends. We want to help you. Dear John, you're such a bad liar. You can't force me. You can't touch me. I'm free. I can ring that bell and people will come running. And they can ask you about your passport. Shall I tell them about your passport John? It's as phony as mine isn't it? It'll be your turn next. Pohlman will like that. He really will. So get out of my way John! Get out! That's where you'll find me if you change your mind. John Sherer. Yeah. Bye. Bye John. Mr. Sherer? Pieter? Yeah. Karl told me I'd find you here. It's what you English call my local. How did you get on with our friend? She didn't want any help. From me she does. She wanted Pohlman's address. You didn't give it to her I trust. We're meeting here at 12:00. She thinks I'm going to give it to her then. You won't will you? It doesn't make any difference. She'll find out for herself. 12:00. Look you know, I think it'd be better if you kept out of this. Just leave it to me. Come in. Mr. Sherer. Yeah. I am Captain Berg. I understand that you have an appointment with my father Colonel Berg. I am here to take you to his office. That's very good of you. My father is a very busy man. Perhaps you could tell me the nature of your business. As a matter of fact it's a matter that I can discuss only with the Colonel. You could tell me anything you would say to my father. I work with him very closely. My appointment is with the Colonel, Captain Berg. As you wish Mr. Sherer. Smoke? Thank you very much. Now, what can I do for you? It's about my wife. I want you to deport her to the west. Your wife is of east German nationality? No, she's a Canadian here on a visit. There's a purpose, this visit? Frankly I don't know. Mr. Sherer I am a very busy man-- My wife has left me. I'd like to get her back. I'm afraid I cannot help you. In any event she must leave when her Visa expires. It's not going to be as simple as that you see. I have a feeling she's going to stay on. Illegally. In which case she will be dealt with in a normal way by the Civil Police. That's exactly what I want to avoid you see. Mr. Sherer you must see this is no matter for me. Yes but you know her already Colonel as Elisabeth Lanzig. So, Lanzig. Then she has not learned her lesson. She still wants to kill Pohlman. My wife has suffered a great deal. You know what Pohlman did to her. With proper care and attention she could get well again. Please give her that chance. I know all about Pohlman's methods. You don't have to explain to me. But we have a new regime here now. I know that Colonel. That's why I came to see you. If you return her now it would be an act of humanity. Maybe. But my duty is to return her to prison. Yeah. If I arrest her, Pohlman will be safe. And if I set her free, who knows? Well I guarantee-- Yes but guarantees are of no value. Tell me, does she know where Pohlman is? Not yet. May I see your passport? I think perhaps I will fail in my duty. You'll deport her? You promise to take more care of her in the future? She'll be at the Cafe Warschau at 12:00. My men will be waiting for her. My son will see you to your hotel Mr. Sherer. Thank you very much, most kind. My wife mustn't know. No, no, no. Naturally my son can be relied upon to arrange everything with discretion. And perhaps next time you will make some tourist business here? Yeah. Thank you. Wonder what happened to Berg. He said he'd be here before the girl. There she is. Is there a telephone around? Over in the cafe, there's a telephone there. Who are you calling Mr. Sherer? I told you to keep out of this. You have strange friends. If I wanted help that's the last number I'd call. I thought that you wanted to stop Lisa too. But why the Security Police Mr. Sherer? Because they promised to deport her. All right, we'll see. If Berg's car takes Lisa to the west Berlin checkpoint, fine. If not, if it takes her to headquarters, I assure you the car will never get there. Lisa will be better dead. And so would you. Time for a quick one? You can't be in that much of a hurry. But I'm not staying. Now just one for old times sake. You haven't changed your mind then? You're wasting your time. I told you not to interfere. Zwei Schnapps please. Do you realize you're keeping me from an old friend? Don't get in my way any more. I mean it. Just don't interfere. Thank you very much. What are you waiting for? That's her. Don't worry Mr. Sherer. We're taking you back to your hotel. Please get in. Hotel Adria isn't it? Yes. Don't be alarmed Mr. Sherer. This is only what you call a technical arrest. Where's Lisa? Get your things together-- Where's my wife? Why did you let her run? Run? Why didn't you arrest her at the cafe? It was done discreetly Mr. Sherer. We have to be careful in such matters. I only have your word for it. And you're entitled to no more. Now pack! Where am I supposed to be going? To the West immediately. Pack! But my visa hasn't expired yet. We do not wish to be unpleasant Mr. Sherer. But you must leave. Perhaps I'd better have a word with your father. Colonel Berg has made the order for you to leave. Oh. It's as well you should. You misled us over the purpose of your visit. You declared you were here on business. Family business. Oh no, that's not what you said. You have committed an offense. Now please! Yeah. My men will see you to the checkpoint. Your bags sir. Just this one sir? Yeah. What are they playing at? They let her go. What did you expect? They'll let her run. The more rope they give her the more old friends she's likely to contact. Not going to contact many old friends now. Not since your people gave her the address. The address? Yes Pohlman's address. Nobody's given her that. Well she's got it. Dacha Rosenberg. How far is it? It's 30 kilometers or so. Quick, to the left. We're gonna be too late. We should have risked the main road. You do underestimate the security police. The place will be swarming with them. Haven't seen one yet. -This way we certainly won't. We'll come in round the house from the south. Forest ranger. That's her car all right. I saw it outside the cafe. The house is through there. Yes, all right. It's the back of the house. Would that be our best approach? I don't know. I've never been so close to it before. You search about here. I'm going around the front. It was just what Berg wanted. As soon as he knew what you'd come to do. Well who could've told him, Pieter? There's plenty of time for inquest later. Let's concentrate on getting her out shall we? And what do you mean what Berg wanted? The Colonel and Pohlman have been at each other's throats for years. They wanted me to kill him. It couldn't have been better. A British agent killing Pohlman out of revenge. Some crocodile tears from the Colonel, a staged trial as a bonus. That's why they let you run. They let me run. All the way from the Warschau. Well you knew. The man who gave you Pohlman's address in the cafe, he was one of Berg's men. Why didn't you warn me? I didn't know at the time. He came to arrest me later. That's right. Doesn't make any difference. Pohlman's dead. But although Berg won't let you go this time Lisa. He's got too much to lose. I think I know a place where we can lie low for a while. Lie low? There's no time for that, we've got to get her out. If you're thinking of the Frontier she wouldn't stand a chance. Not now. -No, I wasn't. What about you? Would you be able to get across? There are soldiers everywhere you go. There's a double wire fence, each fence is electrified, there are mines everywhere. Only the soldiers know the way through. I was talking about the checkpoint. Well you'd never get Lisa through there. The pressure'll be really on now. I wasn't talking about Lisa. What about you? Would you be able to get across with faked papers? Yeah. As a west Berliner going back after day pass. How long will it take to get the papers? Hello. Gut. Auf wiedersehen. Pieter is through. Good Lisa upstairs? Yeah. How long will it take you to get into town Hans? About half an hour. I want you to make a phone call. From a box, don't want it traced. That's easy. Get onto the Security Police at this number. Ask to speak to Otto Berg himself. That's not quite so easy. Insist on speaking to Berg personally and tell him that you have news of Elisabeth Lanzig. Lisa? We know what we're doing Hans. But does Pieter know? Pieter knows. But what should I say? Tell him if he wants Elisabeth Lanzig she'll be crossing the border near..... Give him a description of my car, say that arrangements have been made for her to cross over a few kilometers south just before dusk. But why? What are you trying to do? You remember Pieter's instructions? Yes, but this-- Anything I ask, you do. Otto!.... Guten tag Captain Berg. I think the British soldier there would like to see your papers. Morning Colonel. I'm here quite voluntarily. I have news of your son. Shall we go in? And what about my son? I'd switch off the microphone if I were you Colonel. You are in no position to be impertinent Mr. Sherer. Why have you come here? To tell you that your son has defected to the west. My son is on duty this morning Mr. Sherer. He's in his office on the fourth floor. May we have him in please? Why, why should we? Let's cut out the bluff shall we Colonel? Your son crossed the border into the Federal Republic yesterday. Where did you get all this? Friends. They must be singularly ill informed. I see you're in mourning for Ernst Pohlman. Your wife may have escaped us for a moment-- But she hasn't. That's why I thought we ought to meet. She crossed yesterday. No, no, no. That was another girl that was waiting for me. What do you want Mr. Sherer? The same thing that I've always wanted to get my wife safely home. My friends tell me that an exchange can be officially organized. Impossible. Out of the question. My son simply lost his way. Oh he lost his way all right. My friends tell me that your son is going to make a statement about why he defected, about the sad loss of Ernst Pohlman. Things of that sort... My son will say nothing. Well I don't know a great deal about these matters myself but from what Lisa says I understand that your son will be in no position to deny anything they claim he said. So? I'm advised that all you need to do is to contact the West Berlin authorities. You should have no difficulty in putting his death onto somebody else. Should you? Morning Colonel. Thank you. Your daddy has been very worrled about you. All right. Hop in.
