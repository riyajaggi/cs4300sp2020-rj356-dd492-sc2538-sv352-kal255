 Jeeves and Wooster (1990â€“1993): Season 2, Episode 2 - The Bassetts' Fancy Dress Ball (or, A Plan for Gussie) - full transcript 
 Gussie writes down quirks of Sir Watkyn and Spode in a little notebook to give him confidence, but he loses the notebook. Stephanie finds it but declines to give it back until Jeeves convinces Sir Watkyn to allow her to marry Harold. When Jeeves' efforts backfire, Stephanie gives the notebook to Spode herself. Harold steals a policeman's helmet for Stephanie, who hides it in Bertie's room and then tells the constable and her father that Bertie stole it.
