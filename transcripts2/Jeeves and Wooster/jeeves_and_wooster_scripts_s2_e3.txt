 Jeeves and Wooster (1990â€“1993): Season 2, Episode 3 - The Con (or, Pearls Mean Tears) - full transcript 
 First, Bertie is summoned to a seaside resort by Aunt Agatha, who has a suitable marriage candidate for him. It's just a coincidence that the pearls the young lady pledges as collateral for a loan look exactly like the ones missing from Aunt Agatha's room ... or is it? Then, another of Bertie's friends winds up engaged to Honoria Glosset after misplacing the young lady he wanted to marry, and Jeeves is surprisingly unwilling to assist the friend in regaining his freedom.
