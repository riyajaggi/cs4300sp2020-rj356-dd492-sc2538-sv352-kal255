 To impress a sceptical, moralistic Alex, Belle gives up escorting to become an office temp but she is terrible and quits after only one day. He returns to her but their night of passion is a disaster. Firstly he keeps imagining all her men lined up at the bottom of the bed. They are then interrupted by a drunken, miserable Ben who has thrown over his girl-friend and declares his feelings for Belle, unaware that Alex is in the next room and can hear everything.

 You're not gonna mention the fact that we had sex? Yeah. OK, that was a mistake. We shouldn't have done it. We should just move on. To what? Pastries? We had sex, Hannah. Look, in the heat of the moment, we forgot the reasons why we shouldn't. It's not worth talking about. Let's forget about it. I'd better get to work. Ben! We're cool, aren't we? Yeah. Hi. Thanks for coming round. I know it's not really... What do you want? I wanna show you something. I've thrown out everything. All my escort clothes, my work mobile. I've packed it in. And... I've got a job. A proper one. I've done it because I want us to be together. Is that it? What?  I said, is that it? Cos if it is, I'm gonna go. Hang on. Is that all you're gonna say? About what? - How you feel. - You know how I feel. - I want you to tell me. - All right. I've never felt so humiliated, disgusted and appalled in my life. And I've never felt so cheated, manipulated and... ..and deceived. And if I'm honest... I've never... ..hated someone... ..as much as I hated you that day. - I'm sorry. - Me, too. I tell you what, I'll let you try some. Hold on one sec. Excuse me, could you have a look at my mobile? There's something wrong with it. - What's wrong with it? - It hasn't got your number in it. Excuse me. Try that. Yeah? "Can you let me in?" Yeah, sure. Can I use your phone, please? I left mine at home. My car battery's flat. - Yeah. - Thanks. Hello? Hi, it's Alex McCloud. I broke down in the underground car park on Stephenson Street. An hour. OK, brilliant. Thank you. All right, bye. So they're gonna be an hour and... Do you wanna wait here? We can keep an eye out. No, no. I'll wait in the car. I'm sorry, I'm not sure it's gonna work out tonight. I'm a bit... My head's a bit messed up. I'm sort of breaking up with my girlfriend. I moved out. It's still a bit messy. Well, it's OK if you wanna have a cry. No, I'm fine. I just don't feel particularly... I mean, don't get me wrong, I'd love to. Look, most guys would kill to be on a sofa with a girl as pretty...as you. It would probably do me a world of good to just... Yeah. They just called. They won't be here till two. They said they're gonna phone when they're outside. Something about women priorities or something. It's just not good. Why don't you come and wait inside? Alex, come on, I don't wanna wait for a phone call. I've got work in the morning. What? It's just that... You've ruined my exit. No, no, that was brilliant. Yeah, very good exit. Well, big day tomorrow. New job, first impressions. Yeah. Are you gonna go to bed or are you just gonna stand there? Don't worry, I won't touch you. Well, not unless you pay me. That's really inappropriate. Yeah, I'm going to bed.'Night. Hannah! Hannah! Did you hear the phone ring? Oh, God, I feel sick. I'm ill on my first day! Hannah, did you hear the phone ring? I fell asleep. I think I've got meningitis. Will you blanch my skin? You've not got meningitis. You're tired. See, this is why we should be together. I always think I'm dying. You always know I'm tired. And late. Late, yeah. Tired and late. You know me so well. No, no, you're really late. Hello? - Oh, shit. - Hello? Hello? Hannah. That's perfect, yeah. OK. I'll see you in half an hour. Thank you.Bye. So here I am all ready. Alex, can I say something? Yeah. You know we're good together? Yeah. If I wasn't an escort, would we still be together? Yes. Well, I'm not an escort. Any more. Look, I've got a new job. I'm on my way. It's gonna take a lot more than a new job. It's a start. It's a start, isn't it? - It's a start. - Just... OK, see me tonight. Even if it's to laugh at my cooking for one last time. Hannah. Did you pull the plug out of the phone? Only cos I love you. My problem with the job market is that I'm used to thinking on my back, not my feet. - Piss a lot? - Sorry? Do you piss a lot? We're allowed two toilet breaks - one in the morning, one in the afternoon. No personal calls, no personal emails, no chatter. No crying, no whining. 100 of these, A5, collated and stapled. No personal emergencies unless it is a death or serious maiming. A sick day is a sick day. Six sick days not validated by a medical professional will result in an official warning. 200, collated, stapled. Now, has that all gone in there? Or am I gonna have to draw a little diagram? You can count on me. I love Alex. Alex... I love Alex. I love... ..Alex. I love Alex. He loves me. I love Alex. I love Alex. He loves me. Alex... I love Alex. He loves me... Sorry to interrupt, Hannah. I can see you've got someone with you. No... You're not very good at this, are you? I thought I was just getting the hang of it. No, no, you're not. So we're gonna have to give you something a bit easier. A special task only you can do. - I've gotta shred all these? - No, no, no. - This is just A-C. - What? D-Z are in the basement. Here. Sorry about the big shredder. It's out of order. Shred, shred, shred! I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't... I quit. Another thing she does, right, in all the years, yeah, it's just take, take, take. It is all about her. She never listens, impossible to get a word in. I wanna have a little cheeky one with you. Cheers, cheers. - Ben. - I'm all right. You tend your garden, I'll tend mine. I'm just having a drink. Hey! Fine. No. Thank you. How was work? Uneventful. Go on. Take your glass. No. I am... a million miles away from all this right now. I thought we were just gonna chat. Yeah, over dinner. So I thought why not make a bit of an effort? When are you gonna admit that there's 101 things that we need to sort out before we do this? - Like what? - Like promises. Promises that you're never gonna lie again, that you'll never see your old clients. That you tell me absolutely everything? That you're doing this for yourself and not just for me. And a promise that you're never, ever gonna do that again. I will make every single one of those promises, and you know I will. But I'm not gonna let you stand here and have a go at me for trying to show you how much I love you? And I know this isn't what you want. But I'm gonna keep on making mistakes until I do the one thing that makes you love me again. It's not working. - Sorry. - Give me a minute. No, don't...don't bother, please... Hannah, this just... I can't do this. I can't... God... Oh, God. Oh, God... Oh, God. (POUNDING HEARTBEAT) Oh, God, no. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing.Just erm... - Let me try something else. - Just fucking lie there. - I'm sorry. - Don't. Don't. - I didn't mean that. - It's fine. - I don't know why I said that. - Yeah, you do. You think I'm a whore. No, I don't. Honestly, I don't. I'm trying. It's...I can't really get some things out of my head. This was too soon. - Hello? - "I've been mugged." "Are you gonna open the fucking door?" Yeah, I'll buzz you up. Hang on. It's Ben. He's been mugged. He sounds hammered. - I've been mugged. - Yeah, I know. You said. Come on. What happened? Did they take your wallet? No. I was in town and then I was with some cans. And they didn't let me back in. And I lay down and...The next thing I know, these girls are putting their bag, fucking trying to steal my cans. Some girls stole your lagers? Some girls stole my lager. What are you doing here? I live here. Oh, you live here. What did you do that for, Ben? Whoo! - Is everything all right? - Yeah, it's fine. - Can you just give us a minute? - Yeah, sorry, doctor. What did you do that for, Ben? So I don't have to listen to your boring shit any more. Me and you are over. Find someone else to listen to you moaning. Him! What's the matter, Ben? I broke up with Vanessa.I'm free and single. And I did a sex on a girl last night. Lisa!Very nice. And I've... You don't know because you never talk to me any more. You're a crap friend. Sorry. Why did you break up with Vanessa? Did you do it over us? Not everything in the world is about you. I broke up Vanessa because...I love her but... I'm not in love with her. I love someone else. Where's my phone? Where's my phone? You broke it, Breezy. Hold that for a second. Are you... gonna come to bed for a bit? Just for a little bit. Just to come to bed...Trousers, yeah? Er, I think you can keep those on. - Is he OK? - Yeah, he's fine. What's he doing here? Why is he so drunk? Because I've been a really crap friend. Come to bed. I'm just gonna stay with him for a while. OK. I thought it was Belle complicating things. It turns out it was me all along. - I'm here to make your day. - One last job? - I love you. - Don't work too hard. One hour, £5000. It's not like anyone will know. She is taking a booking. 9:30 tonight. welcome to www.1000fr.com www.tvsubtitles.net
