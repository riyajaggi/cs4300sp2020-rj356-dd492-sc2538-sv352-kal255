 Previously on "Off the Map" What are we doing? We're friends... who are having sex. You're a doctor? Mateo. Hey. Un placer. My parents told me to be a man. "Be someone that... a son that we can be proud of," and I tell them to get out of my life. Somebody's gonna be on dental duty. I don't hold hands.

 I say we call it. What? It's not a fight we can win, plastics, okay? We've been at this for hours. So we just give up? These are kids that we're talking about. What if we penetrate the overlap? That's a long shot. Yeah, but it's a shot, and we're not the kind of crew that doesn't take a shot. All right. Work hard, work fast, stay focused, and you start using your head, okay? Yeah. Yeah. You're going down, amigo. Kick it! Kick it! Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! Come on. There you go, Minard. There you go.

 You okay? You okay? Get out of here, get out of here. Oh. Oh! Brenner! Use your head, Brenner! Your head! That's what I'm talking about. Can you tell these are broken? No. So I was thinking maybe we could hit the cantina tonight, celebrate our narrow loss. Mm. You just want to see your mystery dude. "Hello. My name is Mateo, and I'm a very sexy farmer." He's not a farmer. His parents are. My parents are gonna love this. Look at this. My arm is around a child, and I'm not even wearing a Hazmat suit. My parents would just think I'm on some tropical vacation with all my illegitimate children. They don't know you're here? I haven't told 'em. Did you see Cole hug me? So? People don't hug me. I'm not a person that invites hugs. Or any overture of affection. He's clearly uncomfortable about the whole dentist thing. Huh? They held hands during his tooth extraction. Aw. No, it was nothing, but now he's acting like it was this big thing and that we're best friends now, and it's weird. What happened to your glasses? Uh, it just... Hey, Alma's here. She wants to thank you. For what, all the amazing sex she's having with her stupid boyfriend because I fixed his penis? What should I tell her? "You're welcome." Okay. Really? I got this celibacy thing going on now, which is great, 'cause I'm... I'm way more focused and s-stuff. Uh-huh. Fuller, Minard! Grab your med bags! Come with me! Everyone else, go back to the clinic! Come on! Two Americans were scuba diving in a sea cave when there was an underwater rock slide! Fisherman here found one of 'em on the surface... A 40-year-old male. What about the other? His daughter, 17 years old! Coast guard's still searching for her! They want doctors on the scene when they find her! Get your hands off me. I'm an American citizen. Get your hands off me! I am not leaving here without my daughter. comprende? Habla English? He got scraped up by the coral. Maybe a broken wrist. Nothing too serious. I will call my lawyer. Do you understand me?! Hey, hey. Have you located the daughter? It's a little more serious. She's trapped. Sync by flapinha, corrections by GeirDM for www.addic7ed.com How much do you make being a doctor? A lot less than you make being a bookie, I'll tell you that much. Any news on the girl? She's still down there. The coast guard called for a winch to move the rocks, but they're at least three hours away. She have enough air to last that long? They have backup tanks. Um... you said you'd stop by last night. Ay, lindo, I was busy with patients, and by the time I left, I was tan cansada. "Santiago de Los caballeros." Angus?! Zita. Oh, my God. It's been so long. Who is that? Angus Sinclair. He's a cultural linguist or some pompous crap. Shows up once a year to try and get in Zee's pants. You cut your hair. New tribe, new customs. Okay, what did you bring me? Mm. Manaca! Named after the most beautiful girl in the Tupí Indian tribe. I thought it was appropriate. And what did Santa Claus bring me? Ooh, I'm sure I could scare up a lollipop. You still suck, right? Yeah, tell me, uh, what will we have the honor of removing from your butt today? I think last year's tapeworm was our longest on record. Oh, just a little skin rash. Oh, so syphilis then? Okay. You both have huevos gigantes. Now can I please get back to work? Sure thing, loca. Let's go look at that rash. Okay, we're gonna start taking the coral out piece by piece. It's gonna be painful. It's potentially toxic, so if you feel nauseous or short of breath, let us know. It could be coral poisoning. Three hours for a simple winch. Why can't they just lift the damn rock off her? Well, they don't want to risk another rock slide. It's better to use controlled force. Okay. On one, two... Aah! Three. Good. Aah! Good. Good. So where are you from? Um, D.C. I have an accounting firm there. Shannon's from Boston. Her mother and I divorced when she was 4. You must be close then. What makes you say that? Last time I vacationed with my parents, I was 12. No. We're not close. Not at all. Just... Do it. Get it over with. Aah! Good, good, good. Good. Cole? You picked Cole? This isn't a rash. It's an infection. I'm gonna have to drain the abscesses. Of all the yohos to choose for a boyfriend... he's not my boyfriend. Oh, so what it's just sex? No intimacy, no connection? Sums up Cole perfectly. Leave him alone. Besides, it's early. It could grow into something. Oh, okay. So it wouldn't hurt to see if the ground's fertile, right? Why don't you ask him something personal about you, something a man who cares should know? I guarantee you, he won't have a clue. Stop acting like mi madre. Aah. Stop being such a baby. Thank you. Aah. Hey. What the hell is that? It's a larva. They're botflies. They're maturing inside your skin. Ugh. How did they get there? They land on mammals and lay their eggs. Typically you see it in cattle and horses. And apparently Scottish linguists. Apparently. Ohh. You know, that one was on the surface, but these look like they're gonna be deep. I'm going to have to put you under, so I can cut them out. I've gotta get back to my fieldwork tonight. I can't have surgery. Is there another way? I could try to draw them out. Sounds like a plan, doctora. I haven't told you how I'm going to do it. So you keep the wound dry, okay, with this. Uh, la herida... Cásese... con esto. Sí? I think you mean "séquese con esto." Dry with the gauze? Yeah. You told him to marry the gauze. Oh. Uh, what he said. Okay? Mateo, what are you doing here? Well... It's... It's a little embarrassing. I know we've only just met, but... I've been shot. How is she? How's Shannon? She has a rib fracture and a torn Bronchus. Now her chest is filling with air. It's collapsed her right lung. We need to get her to the clinic right now. So as soon as the winch gets here and we can free up her leg... no, we don't have time to wait for the winch. The winch is still two hours away. Now her oxygen levels are dropping. She won't make it that long. So how are you gonna get the rock off of her? We need to amputate. What? I'm sorry, sir. We don't have a choice. Oh, God. No. I'm sorry. I can't let you cut her leg off. I won't let you do that. Sir, it's her leg or her life. Who shot you? You think I was crazy if I said. I shot myself so I could come see you again? Sí. Well, the truth is a little more humiliating. Try me. There's this animal, the Capybara. Ohh. They eat all my family's crops, so we set rifle traps all over the farm. Me, I've been a city boy for long, I walked right into it, tripped the wire. Stupido idiota. There's no exit wound. What does that mean? Well, we're gonna have to operate, see what kind of damage the bullet did. Just try to relax, okay? You're gonna be fine. How will you see what you're doing with all the blood down there? We'll use tourniquets and clamps to control the bleeding. Will she be in pain? We're gonna block the nerve. She won't feel a thing. But she'll be awake. She'll know what's happening? Yes. Wait. Wait, you could write her a note, you know, let her know that you're thinking of her. What would I say? I don't know. Your feelings or some... I don't know. I'm no good at this stuff either. I should call my client at Walter Reed. He could recommend a good prosthetic specialist. You know, they say sometimes the fake ones are even better. Remember, uh, that double amputee who was disqualified from the Olympics because they said his fake legs gave him an unfair advantage? I think he was South African. Wonder if I could arrange a meeting. You believe this guy? People show concern in different ways, Fuller. I'm gonna bring back your daughter. Wait. Uh... "I'm here. Dad." That's fine. Uh-huh. That's... super. Okay. Right. Be ready with an I.V. And pressure dressings when she surfaces. There's gonna be a lot of blood loss. So these botflies are big breakfast fans then? The bacon starves the larva of oxygen, and it creates a more attractive host for it to migrate towards. Old field doctor's trick. How long do I have to lie here? Mm. A few hours should do the trick. Hey, uh, we got a gunshot wound, and we need you for an ex-lap... is that my bacon?! It's okay. You can have it back when we're done. Liver's repaired. Small bowel looks good. Stomach, colon, all intact. Now my bacon, which I ordered from San Miguel and spent a small fortune on... not intact. Very much compromised. Is that right? That's right. What's my middle name? Wait, you're asking me? I think you should know. Well, give me a clue. It's not "loca." Any sign of the bullet? No. Okay. Pickups and suction. How do you know this kid? Oh, we met at the cantina the other night. Just started talking and... I can remember what that's like... meeting someone, staying up all night asking questions, wanting to know everything about each other. Staying up all night asking questions. Sounds like a hell of a boring date. This kid shot himself setting a hunting trap? That's what he said, yep. Then he lied. What? Farmers use hunting rifles, and this bullet is from a.40-caliber glock. So? The kind cops here use to shoot criminals. Maybe you should've asked a few more questions. Bag it. Call the police. It's clinic policy. All suspicious gunshot wounds. Well, how do we know it's suspicious? He was shot by a cop, brenner. Right. I know he's your friend, but come on. Yeah, it's ok. It's... it's policy. I get it. Good hemostasis. Let's close the deep fascia. - They're coming. - How do you know? Fuller! You've got the leg! Minard! You're gonna tape up the chest wound! I'm on it! Put him right there. Oh, my God. Shannon. Her leg. Oh, God. Ohh. Ohh. Dude! It's coral poisoning. Or he's the worst father ever. All right. You okay? Ohh. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Really? We have patients to worry about. I'm fine. Okay, let's move! We gotta get to the clinic! Let's go! Go! Ohh. Tell Cole that's twice the protein. This feels familiar, doesn't it... me lying in this bed, you extracting creatures from my flesh? It's like we're old dance partners. Look at you. So many scars. So many dances. Dances? Surucucu bite. If I didn't have eclipta alba in my garden, you would have died. You were wearing yellow that day. Necrotizing fasciitis. I had to carve a section out of your calf. You had your hair short then. It was cute. I like it long better. Buruli ulcer. Six years ago, the day we first met. Your read my name off that little clipboard of yours. That's it. I was slayed. You need to leave the jungle. It's eating you alive. I'd quit for you, come live in this Metropolis. You would be miserable. So come with me. I wish I could give you what you want. Who cares what I want or what he wants? What do you want, Zitajalehrena Toledo Alvarez? Ohh. I'm not dead. Well, you lost a lot of blood, but we got the bullet out. You're gonna be all right. In your hands, I knew I would be. I just called the police. The bullet we found in your abdomen wasn't from a hunting trap. It was from a police revolver, and it's clinic policy to report it. Ohh. Ahh. What a you doing? I can't be here when the police come. They're looking for me. You just had major abdominal surgery. You can't just leave like that. Mateo, stop. Stop it. Look, tell me what happened, and maybe I can help you. You can't help me. If you do, they'll hold it against the clinic, against you. I won't have that. Listen to me. You're weak from blood loss. If you go now, you could die, okay? I won't bother you anymore. Lo siento, Lily. Aah. So that's it? Just... No explanations, just good-bye? No. That's good-bye. Okay. I'm bleeding again. Shannon, I'm gonna buy you the best prosthetic, money can buy! You won't even know the difference! All right, Shannon, we've got a tube re-expanding your lung. Should make it a little easier to breathe. Doctor Fuller's gonna finish taking care of your leg now. That wasn't easy down there. You did good. All yours, Fuller. So I freed up a flap of skin, and I sealed it over the bone. You wanna look? Why would I wanna do that? I know it sounds weird, but I worked with a lot of amputees in residency, and the theory is that, the sooner you look at it and accept it as normal, the better. I lost my leg because Nick made me go on this stupid trip. It's not normal, and it's never gonna be. Wait, she said he was her "friend"? That's the word she used, but I'm guessing it's more than that. Oh, the police are on their way. Hey, you sure you're okay? You've been short of breath ever since... will you stop worrying about me? I'm fine. Whoa. Could it be the bends? She must've been underwater too long. Let's get her on oxygen. I'll set up the chamber. Keeton wants to talk to you. Mm. Well, that's great, but I don't have time for that right now. My patient, who is most likely a serial killer, just busted his stitches. Awesome. No, no, no. Not awesome. He just kissed me. The Serial Killer? Yeah. Wait, wait. While he was bleeding? That's smooth. You're both so unhelpful rit now. When did your life become a Spanish soap opera? Celibacy, yo. All this... Could've been avoided. It's true. I'm giving you a transfusion. You're not tolerating the blood loss... And jumping out of bed to go on the lam didn't exactly help. You're angry. Yeah, I just like to know the person I'm kissing. Guess I'm old-fashioned like that. A few weeks ago I wasn't a guy with a bullet in his gut. I was just a law student. So what happened? They knocked on my family's door... them and 30 other people who worked that land... said they were evicting them from the property. No reason, no legal foot to stand on. Just "move in a week, or we'll move you." Why do the police want land? No, it's not the police. They're corrupt. It's... it's the people lining their pockets. So I left school, came home to help my family. And the gunshot wound? A cop was threatening my sister. I got angry and threw a punch. Maybe not the best move. I'd do it again. They can put a million holes in my body. I'm not going anywhere. This is my family, and I'll fight if I have to. Good radial pulse. How do you feel? Stronger. So the doctors said the surgery went well. Talked to a friend of mine at Walter Reed. He's, uh, on the board there, big-time. He gave me a list of specialists. You didn't write that note, did you? What note? On the slate. It wasn't your handwriting. Shannon, I know it's difficult to grow up without a father... you left when I was 4! I barely even remember you, and then one day an expensive pair of boots shows up on my birthday, and suddenly I have a dad again? I was just trying to have a relationship with you. You just want to stop feeling guilty! That's what all these big gestures are about... the gifts and this trip. So now I'm stuck in the middle of the jungle without a leg, trying to make a stranger feel better about himself. You want me to look at my stump? There! I looked at my stupid stump! Just don't make me look at him. Shannon. Get him out of here! Please. Get him out! How's Clark? Well, she's off-gassing her nitro, but she should be fine in a f hours. How are you doing? Loca's giving me the "how well do you know my soul?" Quiz. Ow. And how are you scoring so far? I'm not taking it. Bold. Yeah, well, am I supposed to play games just because Scottish McAssface shows up? What am I, 15? No, no, no. You're very mature. Damn right. Hey, uh, I take it that's her "friend"? That's him. The hives have all cleared up. You okay? When we first saw the coral, before the rock slide, Shannon's eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. She had this smile. I know that smile. Like when she was 4 years old. She just needs time. It'll be... it'll be okay. It's not okay! She's... For that poor girl to grow up with me as a father, it is not okay! It is not okay! It is not okay! This was my chance to fix things, and I blew it. Here. It's okay. Her mother's coming, and she'll fix everything. She'll take care of her. I'm not equipped. I'm an accountant. Are you Dr. Brenner? Yeah. Officer Reyes. I'm here about the gunshot wound you reported. Right. You said that the bullet you found came from the pistola of a Policía. I did... say that. Where is your patient? Uh, it turns out I was wrong. The man I treated was, uh, was just a farmer. Yeah, he was setting, um, a hunting trap, and he shot himself in the hand, so I just released him a few hours ago. So were you lying then, or are you lying now, Doctora? She's not lying. I'm... she made a mistake. Dr. Brenner's still working on her Spanish. She misunderstood the patient. So the patient you treated was not this man? Nope. Bueno, because he attacked an officer today. He's a wanted man. Maybe I'll just take a look around, in case he slipped through the cracks. All due respect, Officer, I'd rather you didn't disturb our patients. I'll be rápido. Don't worry. Toledo. Your middle name's... Toledo. I looked at your file. Also saw that you make 50 bucks more than me. Remind me to talk to Keeton about that. Lindo, I'm done. What are you talking about? I'm done. What, 'cause I don't know your middle name? I mean, uh, it's a city in Spain. It's a city in Ohio, where my father is from... my American father, who had his fun with mi madre, then left. "Toledo" was her way of reminding me not to make the same mistake that she did. She had a dark sense of humor. I'm from Poughkeepsie. And I'm just a fling. Uh... If McBaconthief hadn't shown up today... we'd still be having this conversation. Officer, we have a nursing mother in the last bed. I'll let her know we're coming, so she can cover up. Where is your nursing mother? She must've been discharged. Thank you for your time. I think I've seen enough. Your dressing is dry. That's good. What? Your dressing is dry. You were wrong about your dad. It's not just guilt. He's an idiot. Hey. He's an accountant. He thinks in terms of money. That's why he buys you stuff. It's his way of telling you he cares. Normal people say they care by saying they care. Well, sometimes they can't say it. Sometimes it's been so long, it's easier to just... Buy some boots or book a trip or go off the grid and be a doctor in the middle of the jungle. I haven't spoken to my parents in over a year. Now I'm down here in the middle of nowhere, trying to prove something. I don't even know what it is, but I know that I'm trying to prove it to them. It's all for them. So maybe all that stuff, booking this trip... maybe he's trying to prove something to you. Why can't you talk to your parents? They're a million miles away. Nick's just down the hall. Thank you... For protecting him. He's not a bad guy. He just... everybody's got a story down here that'll make 'em sound like a hero. I wasn't protecting him, Brenner. Just be careful. You wanna tuck me in? I checked the dive tables, and at 30 feet, you should've been good down there for another three hours. I came up too fast then. No, Pulmonary Embolism manifests immediately, and you know that. Now yours started hours after we surfaced, and you were short of breath at the soccer game, too. You're being paranoid. I wanna run an E.K.G. And a chest X-ray. Ben, it's late. You wanna sing me a lullaby, you can stay. If not... Buenas noches. If you wanna stay the night, we can find you a bed. Oh, no. My ex-wife's coming, and Shannon... you know, I- I think she'd rather be alone. I'll just crash at the hotel. I'll call you a taxi. Thank you. Hey, Nick. How you feeling? You wanna see it? ♪ whenever I ♪ ♪ seem too cold ♪ ♪ even I ♪ ♪ seem too old ♪ Oh, Shannon, I'm so sorry. ♪ just wanna hold you ♪ It's not your fault. ♪ just wanna hold you ♪ ♪ but I can't see ♪ It's really gone, huh? ♪ but I can't see ♪ ♪ no, my mind ♪ You know, he could've gone to her. She is the person with one leg. You don't know how hard that is for him, just sitting there holding her hand. That's huge. Until next year then. Please come back with something less repugnante. I'll do my best. ♪ Wanna hold you ♪ Okay, if you're gonna grab me and beg me not to go, now would be a good time. Go back to the jungle, where you belong. We don't even know if we'd have any chemistry together. Zita... ♪ No, my mind seems to fall ♪ I think we'd do just fine. I have something to say. No. Uh... it's actually easier if you keep it on your face. In med school, they called me the ice queen. They'd go, "oh, look, one of the cadavers got loose." It was kinda mean. Anyway, uh... The hand-holding and hugging wouldn't mean anything to most people, but... I don't do that, not with patients or boyfriends or even when I was little, crossing the street with my mother. I just wanted you to know that I... It wasn't nothing... to me. It was... it was something. So... Hello? Minard? Huh. Fuller! You're just in time for a toast. To what? Celibacy, because living in a Spanish soap opera is overrated and a little bit humiliating, actually. Yeah. Don't even get me started on humiliation. I just had a conversation with a hat. What? I don't wanna talk about it. Cheers. Ah. Alma. Hi. Um... how is your novio? Muy bien. Gracias. Good. Good. Well, you know, if anyone else needs help with their penis, just send 'em to me. Yeah, you don't want me to say that. Terminé con mi novio. She just broke up with her boyfriend. Oh, really? I, um, I'm sorry. Are you okay? Sí. Estoy bien. Te quiere invitar a una copa... She wants to buy you a drink. Para darte Las gracias por ayudarlo? To thank you for helping him. Oh. Dude, I just think she wants to buy you a drink. You know, I would... I would love to do that... También gustaría eso. But I'm just trying to focus on my medicine right now, so... Pero en esto momento, estáintentando enfocarse en la medicina. Comprendo. What are you thinking? Come on, man. You gotta hit that. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We just did the celibacy toast. Who cares? Pfft. What? Go, go, go! Go. Okay, okay. Alma. I, uh... Ohh. Whoa. Comprende? Comprendo. sync by flapinha, corrections by GeirDM for www.addic7ed.com
