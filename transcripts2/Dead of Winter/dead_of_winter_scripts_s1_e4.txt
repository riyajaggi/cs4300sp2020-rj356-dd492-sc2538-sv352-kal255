 I DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO GO THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND NOT CHANGE. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOT QUESTION. I'M NOT WHO I WAS. EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO FEEL SAFE IN THEIR HOME. HOW DARE YOU? HOW DARE SOMEONE DO THIS TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING? IT WAS BAD ENOUGH I'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS MESS, BUT NOW IT'S SPREADING. NOW IT'S HIT ANOTHER FAMILY. I COULDN'T HAVE WROTE THIS IN A MILLION YEARS THAT IT WOULD TURN OUT LIKE THIS.

 I WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF SOMEONE WHO... ENJOYED EVIL. HELLO? I KNEW VIRGINIA BECAUSE I HAD TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER AT HIGH SCHOOL, AND THEN, OF COURSE, I KNEW HER BECAUSE SHE WAS A NEIGHBOR IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I REMEMBER BEING UP AT SCHOOL. IT WAS COLD. IT WAS VERY, VERY COLD. IT WAS OBVIOUS WHEN I WALKED UP TO PEOPLE THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED AND PROBABLY NOT GOOD. WHAT'S WRONG? YOU DIDN'T HEAR?

 THEY FOUND VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN. THEY THINK SHE'S BEEN MURDERED. VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN WAS A 75-YEAR-OLD WIDOW WHO LIVED ALONE. IT'S A -- IT'S A SHOCK. THOSE WORDS, YOU CAN HEAR THOSE WORDS, BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT IN. IT'S -- IT'S VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN. YOU WENT FROM, "NO. MY GOSH. THAT'S AWFUL. VIRGINIA! THAT'S TERRIBLE," AND ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY IT'S, "WHAT HAPPENED?" AND THAT WAS THE UNKNOWN. IT'S FREEZING OUT THERE. YEAH, WELL DON'T EXPECT THIS TO WARM YOU UP. - SO WHERE IS SHE? - FOLLOW ME. VIRGINIA'S BODY WAS FOUND BY HER BROTHER BECAUSE SHE HADN'T ANSWERED THE PHONE, SHE HADN'T BEEN TO CHURCH, SO HE WENT OVER THERE TO CHECK ON HER, AND THEN HE CALLED 911. MORNING, PETE. WHAT DO WE GOT? SHORT STORY, I THINK SOMEBODY SNUCK UP BEHIND HER. SHE WAS SITTING AT A TABLE, HER BACK TO THE KITCHEN, WATCHING TELEVISION. SHE'S WRITING A CHECK, PROBABLY NEVER EVEN SAW IT COMING. POOR LADY? I THOUGHT IT WAS A GUNSHOT BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE THE POINT OF ENTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN A SMALL PROJECTILE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS SPATTER. - PROBABLY A SMALL BULLET. - TRUE. DID YOU FIND ANY CASINGS? NO, WE'VE SEARCHED EVERYWHERE. GUESS THEY WERE SMART ENOUGH TO CLEAN UP. THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO SHOW YOU OUTSIDE. THE FIRST THING I DID WAS WENT AND LOOKED AT THE POINT OF ENTRY WHICH WAS THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOUSE, A BASEMENT WINDOW THAT HAD BEEN REMOVED COMPLETELY AND SAT ON THE GROUND. OKAY, WHAT DO WE GOT? LOOKS LIKE THEY BROKE IN THROUGH THAT WINDOW. DID YOU GET ANY PRINTS? IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD. BETWEEN THE SNOW AND THE FACT THAT THEY PROBABLY USED GLOVES TO GET IN, I DON'T THINK WE'LL GET MUCH. DID YOU SEEN THIS? THIS WINDOW HAS GOT SNOW UNDERNEATH AND ON TOP. THE ONLY WAY THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS IF THEY KNOCK THIS OUT WHILE IT'S SNOWING. IT HASN'T SNOWED SINCE... SUNDAY. I KNEW IT WAS A MAJOR ICE STORM ON SUNDAY THE 3rd BECAUSE I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING TO CHURCH, SO HER LAST DAY ALIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME TIME ON SUNDAY, AND SHE WAS FOUND ON TUESDAY. Detective Burgert, come in. - YEAH, GO AHEAD. - We're in the garage. The car is missing. Looks like it could be a possible theft. COPY THAT. SO IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS TO US WHOEVER WENT INTO THE HOUSE WENT IN THROUGH THE WINDOW, WALKED UP TO HER, MURDERED HER, AND FOUND HER CAR KEYS WHEREVER THEY WERE KEPT AND TOOK THE CAR. SHE HAD BEEN DEAD AT LEAST TWO DAYS, WHICH, YOU KNOW, IN THE EVENT OF SOMEONE GETTING AWAY, IT GIVES THEM 48 HOURS TO COVER THEIR TRACKS. HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY IN WISCONSIN, VIRGINIA'S DAUGHTER, BARBARA, HAS NOT YET HEARD THE NEWS. REMEMBER TO GRAB YOUR HAT, HON. IT'S GONNA BE A COLD ONE TODAY. I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD HAVE MOVED TO FLORIDA. JOHN AND I WERE HAVING BREAKFAST. HELLO? AND I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM MY AUNT, MOM'S SISTER, SAYING, "BARB, YOUR MOM HAS BEEN KILLED." YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE? HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? I THINK THAT THE EMOTIONAL WASH REALLY STARTED WITH DISBELIEF. THIS CAN'T HONESTLY BE TRUE. MY GOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT I WAS FEELING. I NEEDED TO KEEP IT TOGETHER, AND I NEEDED TO BE FUNCTIONAL, AND I DIDN'T NEED EMOTIONS GETTING IN THE WAY. HON? WHAT IS IT? JOHN KNEW THAT. HE RECOGNIZED THAT. IT'S MOM. AND SO HE GAVE ME A SHOT OF WHISKEY TO NUMB THEM A LITTLE BIT, AND THEN HERE'S THE FIRST QUESTION -- ARE WE TAKING YOUR CAR OR MINE? ON THE DRIVE, I WAS TERRIFIED THAT I WOULD SEE HER THERE. I DID NOT WANT TO SEE HER AT ALL. IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HER. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MOCKERY, A PUPPET, A DOLL. SO SORRY. THIS IS MY CHILDHOOD HOME. THIS WAS WHERE I SPENT THE FIRST 17 YEARS OF MY LIFE, BUT THAT HOUSE WAS HOME BECAUSE IT WAS WHERE MOM WAS, AND NOW IT WASN'T ANYMORE. IT WAS JUST A HOUSE. I DID NOT HAVE TO IDENTIFY HER BODY, FOR WHICH I WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL BECAUSE MY UNCLE HAD ALREADY IDENTIFIED THE BODY. HI, BARBARA. I'M SO SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS. I KNOW THIS IS HARD. WOULD YOU MIND TAKING A LOOK AROUND WITH US AND SEE IF ANYTHING IS MISSING? WE WENT IN AND LOOKED IN HER BEDROOM AND AT THAT POINT, IT WAS... THE CEDAR CHEST HAD BEEN BROKEN OPEN, AND HER DRESSER HAD BEEN RIFLED. HER JEWELRY, IT WAS IN THIS DRAWER. IN MY MIND THEN, IT WAS A BURGLARY THAT WENT BAD. HER RING. THEY STOLE IT. WHAT KIND OF RING? HER HIGH SCHOOL CLASS RING, MADONNA HIGH. SHE LOVED THAT RING. SHE USED TO WEAR IT ALL THE TIME. IT WAS RECTANGULAR. IT WAS GOLD, AND IT HAD A LITTLE ENGRAVING OF THE SCHOOL ON THE FRONT, AND ON THE INSIDE, IT WAS ENGRAVED WITH HER INITIALS. WELL, ONCE WE KNEW THERE WAS A MADONNA CLASS RING MISSING, IT WAS REALLY A KIND OF NICE LITTLE PERK TO HAVE ON THE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S SO UNIQUE. YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY MIGHT HAVE A CITIZEN WATCH, BUT NOT EVERYBODY HAS GOT A CLASS RING FROM MADONNA. SO WE FIND THE RING, WE FIND WHO DID THIS TO YOUR MOTHER. THE PROBLEM WAS TYPICALLY BURGLARS DO NOT GO INTO HOMES WHEN THEY KNOW SOMEBODY IS THERE. WHOEVER WENT INTO THAT HOUSE, MAY HAVE INTENDED TO KILL HER. THE POLICE ASKED WHETHER SHE HAD ANY ENEMIES, AND I HAD TO SAY, "NOT AS FAR AS I KNOW." KILL HER? I CAN'T IMAGINE. 75-YEAR-OLD WOMEN IN THEIR HOME DON'T USUALLY GET EXECUTED BY SOMEBODY. WORD SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE BECAUSE IT WAS A SMALL COMMUNITY. I THINK PEOPLE ARE STUNNED, AND THEY'RE -- WE WERE ALL SORT OF FROZEN, I GUESS. EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO FEEL SAFE IN THEIR HOME, AND WITH THE DEATH OF VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN, THE MURDER OF VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN, IT ROCKED THAT WHOLE SENSE OF...OF... TRANQUILITY. AT THAT POINT, POLICE GAVE US NO INDICATION THEY HAD ANYBODY THEY WERE PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT. IT WAS VERY MUCH WHAT WOULD BE ACCURATELY TERMED SENSELESS. WE KNEW HER CAR WAS STOLEN. HER CAR HAD BEEN IN HER GARAGE. SHE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT DROVE THE CAR. THE CAR WAS GONE, SO WE DID PUT OUT AN ATTEMPT TO LOCATE THAT CAR PRETTY QUICKLY THAT DAY WITH THE LICENSE PLATE ON IT. THE AURORA POLICE DEPARTMENT FOUND IT IN A PARKING LOT OF AN EAGLE FOOD STORE, CLOSE DISTANCE FROM THE MURDER SCENE. TO END UP WITHIN A MILE AND A HALF OF HER HOME WAS SIGNIFICANT. WHOEVER TOOK THE CAR, DID THEY LIVE IN THAT AREA? DID YOU GET ANYTHING OFF IT? NOTHING. NO FINGERPRINTS. IT WAS CLEAN. THAT'S ALWAYS VERY DISAPPOINTING WHEN YOU DON'T GET EVIDENCE, YOU KNOW, LATENT FINGERPRINTS TO INDICATE WHO MAY HAVE DONE IT. WE DID BETTER WITH THE AUTOPSY, THOUGH. RECOVERED A BULLET FRAGMENT, A.22. UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS VERY DEGRADED. AT LEAST WE KNEW WHAT CALIBER THE BULLET WAS, BUT WE WERE DISAPPOINTING IN THE FACT THAT WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MATCH IT TO A GUN. ALL RIGHT, WELL, THANKS. LET ME KNOW IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING ELSE, ALL RIGHT? THERE WAS NOTHING TO GO ON. WE HAD NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. IT'S TOUGH, VERY TOUGH. I DID WANT TO STAY INFORMED, BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT THEY COULD TELL US. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE CALLING ME TO TELL ME BASICALLY NOTHING. I WAS FRUSTRATED. WITH LITTLE EVIDENCE, DETECTIVES MUST WORK WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE KILLER'S MOTIVE WAS ROBBERY. MY PARTNER WHO INITIALLY RESPONDED TO THIS CRIME SCENE FOUND OUT FROM AURORA P.D. THAT THEY HAD A SUSPECT IN SOME AREA BURGLARIES, SO THAT KIND OF PERKED OUR INTEREST A LITTLE BIT ON THIS GUY. THAT HIM? YEAH. THAT'S HIM ON THE LEFT. LIONEL LANE, WHO LIVED IN THE AREA, WHO HAD AN ARREST RECORD THAT WAS RIGHT UP OUR ALLEY. HE DID TIME PREVIOUS FOR A HOME INVASION. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. THIS GUY HAS DONE THIS BEFORE, AND LIONEL LANE AT THAT TIME WAS LIVING IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX ON FELTON ROAD NORTH OF WHERE VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN LIVED, PROBABLY LESS THAN A QUARTER MILE. I THOUGHT THAT THIS SOMEONE HAS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA. THEY HAVE TO KNOW THAT IT'S THIS ELDERLY WOMAN, HOME ALONE. I DON'T THINK IT WAS RANDOM. AURORA ARRESTS HIM FOR AN OUTSTANDING TRAFFIC WARRANT, AND THEY TAKE HIM TO AURORA POLICE DEPARTMENT. EVENTUALLY, WE GO TO AURORA POLICE DEPARTMENT AND INTERVIEW HIM. LIONEL, YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE, LIONEL? 'CAUSE I WAS DOING 35 IN A 30. THAT'S WHAT THEY GOT YOU IN HERE FOR, LIONEL. WE WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT A MURDER. WHAT MURDER? COME ON, LIONEL. DON'T PLAY DUMB. LOOK, MAN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU TALKING ABOUT. I'VE NEVER KILLED NOBODY. YOU KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT HOME INVASIONS? RIGHT, LIONEL? HOME INVASION GOES BAD. THING IS IT HAPPENED ON FELTON ROAD, RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FROM WHERE YOU LIVE. LISTEN, MAN. I DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT, I SWEAR. BUT I THINK I MIGHT KNOW WHO DID. HE GIVES US INFORMATION ABOUT THREE OR FOUR GUYS WHO WANTED TO BURGLARIZE THE JOHANNESSEN HOME. WE'RE LISTENING. THE VERY NEXT DAY, HE HEARS ONE OF THE GUYS SAYING TO ONE OF THE OTHER PLAYERS, "YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT LIKE THAT." WE TALKED TO THE OTHER THREE INDIVIDUALS THAT LIONEL NAMED. SOME, WE NEVER EVEN GOT THROUGH THE MIRANDA CARD. THEY DIDN'T -- "WELL, I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU." ONE DID. THE TEST IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY. SO WHY DO I HAVE TO TAKE IT THEN? BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE IT AND YOU PASS, WE LET YOU GO. FINE. DO YOU KNOW A MAN NAMED LIONEL LANE? NO. WERE YOU INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN? NO. ACCORDING TO OUR POLYGRAPH EXAMINER, THIS GENTLEMAN WAS IN THE CAR AND KNEW OF THE MURDER, BUT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY GET THEM IN CUSTODY. THE STATE'S ATTORNEY WANTED MORE, SO WE KEPT WORKING IT. DETECTIVES TRACK DOWN LIONEL LANE'S EX-GIRLFRIEND, HOPING SHE CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION. HI, LORI? YES? WE'RE DETECTIVES WITH THE KANE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT WE SPOKE WITH YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND A WHILE BACK ABOUT A MURDER, LIONEL LANE? I DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. LET'S MAKE THIS EASY, OKAY? NOW, LIONEL TOLD US THAT THESE THREE MEN WERE INVOLVED. DO YOU RECOGNIZE ANY OF THESE NAMES? I DON'T... IT'S OKAY. IT'S JUST US HERE. FINE. THEY WERE ALL A PART OF IT AND LIONEL, TOO. BASICALLY SHE GIVES ME THE THREE NAMES AND LIONEL AS INVOLVED IN THIS JOHANNESSEN HOMICIDE. I'M SORRY. THAT'S ALL I KNOW. I REALLY HAVE TO GET BACK TO MY SON. OKAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WE'LL BE IN TOUCH. DETECTIVES ARE CLOSING IN ON LIONEL LANE, BUT WITHOUT AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT FROM LORI, IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH, AND THE CASE IS ABOUT TO TAKE A SHOCKING TURN. THE SORROW, THE GRIEF, THE GRIEVING, IT HITS YOU AT 2:37 A.M. ON A DAY THAT YOU DON'T EXPECT IT AT ALL. IT HITS YOU IN THE RESTAURANT WHEN YOU HEAR A LAUGH THAT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE HERS. IT HITS YOU IN THE STORE WHEN YOU SEE A KID MOUTHING OFF TO HIS MOTHER, AND YOU WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO SHAKE HIM AND SAY, "DON'T YOU DARE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT?" THAT'S WHEN THE GRIEF HITS. IT HAS NOW BEEN ALMOST A YEAR SINCE THE MURDER OF VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN. AS WINTER BEGINS TO DESCEND ON AURORA AGAIN, THE PRIME SUSPECTS ARE FREE. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, ABOUT 1/8 OF A MILE FROM THE JOHANNESSEN HOMICIDE ON THE SAME STREET... ...THERE'S ANOTHER HOMICIDE. SHERIFF'S OFFICE RECEIVED A CALL OF SHOTS FIRED IN A HOME ON FELTON ROAD, WHICH WAS DOWN THE STREET FROM VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN'S HOME. IT IS THE HOME OF 55-YEAR-OLD JILL OBERWEIS. LIKE VIRGINIA, JILL WAS A WIDOW LIVING ALONE, BUT THIS MURDER DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A BURGLARY GONE WRONG. THERE DEFINITELY WAS A SHIFT IN OUR THINKING WHEN OBERWEIS HAPPENED BECAUSE NOTHING WAS EVEN TAKEN IN THE OBERWEIS. I THINK THEY SET OUT TO KILL PEOPLE. THEY WENT INTO THOSE HOMES KNOWING THEY WERE GOING TO KILL THESE WOMEN, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DID. - DETECTIVE! - BARBARA? WE HAVE TO STOP THIS. WHOEVER IS DOING THIS, YOU GOT TO FIND THEM. I KNOW. I KNOW. BARBARA, WE'RE GONNA GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. I PROMISE. PLEASE, YOU'RE ALL WE'VE GOT. I THINK IT'S PROBABLY LIKE LIGHTNING STRIKING TWICE ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE STREET. I SAW IT HAPPENING ALL OVER AGAIN, NOW TO THEIR NEIGHBOR, ONE OF THEIR BEST FRIENDS. THERE WERE ONLY SEVEN HOUSES ON THE STREET. THE STREET WAS A HALF A MILE LONG. EVERYBODY KNEW EVERYBODY. AND IT JUST... I WAS ANGRY, BUT I WAS JUST BROKENHEARTED THAT THIS IS GOING ON. PEOPLE WERE PUTTING HOMES UP FOR SALE. AT VIRGINIA'S HOUSE, IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO BY THAT HOUSE WITHOUT -- AND JILL OBERWEIS' ALSO -- WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE HORRIBLE THING THAT HAD HAPPENED THERE. IT WAS A LITTLE BIT LIKE A HEADSTONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, BOTH HOMES. POLICE HAVE NO SUSPECTS IN THE KILLING OF WIDOW JILL OBERWEIS. IT'S THE SECOND MURDER IN UNDER A YEAR. AURORA RESIDENTS, NOW LIVING IN FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES. COULD THERE BE A SERIAL KILLER ON THE LOOSE? NOW YOU HAD TWO MIDDLE-AGED, ELDERLY WOMEN, ON THE SAME ROAD, MURDERED, EXECUTED BY SOMEONE. I TOOK IT, YOU KNOW, PERSONALLY THAT WE COULDN'T SOLVE IT RIGHT AWAY. I DO REMEMBER THINKING, "THIS IS NOT DONE. "I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT, BUT THIS IS NOT DONE." IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE GO BACK TO SQUARE ONE SITUATIONS. THAT'S NOT WHAT I... DETECTIVES, THAT BALLISTICS REPORT? WE HAD CASINGS IN THE HALLWAY FROM ONE GUN AND CASINGS WHERE SHE WAS SHOT FROM A SECOND GUN. BOTH WERE.22 CALIBER GUNS. SAME AS THE JOHANNESSEN MURDER. I'LL DO YOU ONE BETTER. WE GOT A SHELL CASING THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MATCH TO A GUN THIS TIME. GREAT. AGAIN, ALL WE HAD WAS SHELL CASINGS, BUT NOW WE NEED A GUN. - ALL RIGHT. - THANKS. BUT THE RECOVERY OF THE SHELL CASINGS IS GOLD. YOU KNOW, GUNS SHOW UP UNLESS THEY THREW THEM IN A RIVER. THEY SHOW UP SOMEWHERE. ATTENTION ALL UNITS, WE HAVE A 273D, DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE IN PROGRESS AT 594 SHEFFER ROAD. SUSPECT IS AN EDWARD TENNEY, CAUCASIAN MALE. THE AURORA POLICE DEPARTMENT CAME TO A DOMESTIC QUARREL BETWEEN EDWARD TENNEY AND HIS GIRLFRIEND. BE ADVISED, SUSPECT MAY BE ARMED. HE HAD A LONG CRIMINAL HISTORY, A LOT OF BURGLARIES, BURGLARIES WITH GUNS. WE FOUND OUT THAT TENNEY WAS WANTED ON AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT. I TOLD YOU TO LISTEN! - YOU GOT THAT? - WILL YOU JUST LEAVE ME ALONE? YOU GOT THAT? - COME ON! - DON'T TOUCH ME! - YOU'RE GONNA BE LIKE THIS? - FREEZE! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? YOU'RE UNDER ARREST, SIR. WAIT. WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HIM? GET OFF ME! GET OFF! ****. MA'AM. MA'AM? WE'RE GONNA GET YOU CHECKED OUT. I NEED YOU TO TELL ME ARE THERE ANY WEAPONS ON THE PREMISE? CAN YOU SHOW ME? SHE GAVE THE POLICE A GUN THAT EDWARD HAD. THAT GUN WAS SUBSEQUENTLY LINKED TO THE OBERWEIS MURDER. IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE A SECOND MURDER IN AURORA, ILLINOIS, AND POLICE HAVE LOCATED ONE OF THE MURDER WEAPONS IN THE HOME OF 34-YEAR-OLD CRIMINAL EDWARD TENNEY. WE GO INTERVIEW THIS SUSPECT AND READ HIM HIS RIGHTS, AND WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE GUN. A WOMAN WAS KILLED TWO WEEKS AGO, MARY JILL OBERWEIS. KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT? NO. WHY? BECAUSE THE GUN WE FOUND IN YOUR HOUSE WAS THE GUN THAT KILLED HER. YOU'RE NOT GONNA PUT THAT ON ME. I JUST BOUGHT THAT GUN LIKE A WEEK AGO. HE DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE MURDER OR ANY CONNECTION TO IT. HE JUST BOUGHT THE GUN OFF THE STREET. HE GAVE ME A REALLY GOOD DEAL, SO I DIDN'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS. GUNS THEN WEREN'T REGISTERED, AND PEOPLE EVEN UP UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO, COULD SELL THEM TO ANYBODY THEY WANTED TO. COME ON, ED. LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT YOUR FRIEND OR IF YOU TWO ARE IN ON IT TOGETHER, BUT IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING, YOU TELL US NOW. ACCORDING TO THE NEIGHBOR AT OBERWEIS, HE THOUGHT THERE WERE TWO RUNNERS. NOW I'M THINKING IN MY MIND, "LIONEL AND THIS GENTLEMAN WITH THE GUN," SO THOSE ARE -- IN MY MIND NOW, THOSE ARE TWO KEY PLAYERS. I WANT TO HELP YOU GUYS. I REALLY DO, BUT IF YOU GOT ANY MORE QUESTIONS, I'M GONNA NEED A LAWYER. DETECTIVES SUSPECT ED TENNEY IS INVOLVED IN THE MURDERS, BUT A SURPRISE VISIT WILL SHIFT THE INVESTIGATION BACK TO THEIR FIRST SUSPECT, LIONEL LANE. A COUPLE DAYS LATER, LORI, THE EX-GIRLFRIEND OF LIONEL LANE, COMES TO THE POLICE STATION. HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO SIT ON THE BENCH OVER THERE? OKAY. I'VE BEEN THINKING. I WANT TO MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE. THAT NIGHT, I WAS IN THE CAR WITH LIONEL. SHE TELLS ME THAT SHE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE CAR WITH HER 6-YEAR-OLD SON, THE THREE OTHER INDIVIDUALS, AND LIONEL AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER OF VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN. LIONEL GOT OUT OF THE CAR WITH TWO OF THE GUYS, THEN... I JUST HEARD A GUNSHOT. AND I STARTED SCREAMING, "WHAT IS GOING ON?" AND THEN... I GRABBED MY SON, AND WE STARTED RUNNING. YOU'RE DOING GREAT, LORI. SHE SEEMED KNOWLEDGEABLE. HOW CREDIBLE, I DON'T KNOW. LORI, I KNOW THIS IS UNCOMFORTABLE, BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR SON. IS THAT OKAY? THE KID WAS VERY SHARP. I ASKED HIM IF HE EVER REMEMBERED BEING IN A CAR WHEN IT WAS KIND OF COLD OUTSIDE, AND HE SAID, "I CAN REMEMBER WE COULDN'T RUN TOO FAST." AND I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE GETTING GRABBED OUT OF A CAR AND RUNNING. RIGHT? JUST A SECOND. HE STARTS CRYING. I JUST THINK OF MY GRANDSON. SO... HE REMEMBERED THE WHOLE INCIDENT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY, AND IT WAS 8, 9, 10, 12 MONTHS LATER ALMOST. YOU THINK IF I SHOW YOU THESE FACES, YOU CAN REMEMBER WHO WAS WITH YOU IN THE CAR THAT NIGHT? I SHOWED HIM PICTURES OF THE THREE INDIVIDUALS AND -- AND LIONEL... AND SOME OTHERS THAT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN. YOU SURE IT'S THIS GUY? AND HE PICKED OUT THE FOUR, AND HE DIDN'T KNOW THE OTHERS, SO HE WAS CREDIBLE, SO IT MADE HER CREDIBLE. OKAY, BEN. YOU DID A REAL GOOD JOB. - OKAY? - OKAY. - LET'S GET YOU BACK TO YOUR MOM. - OKAY. DETECTIVES ARE NOW CERTAIN THAT LIONEL AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN. THERE WAS A BIG BREAK, AND FOUR MEN WERE ARRESTED. WHAT I WAS FEELING WHEN THEY TOLD ME WAS, "GOOD. I'M GLAD." AND THEN THERE WAS, "WAIT A SECOND. THIS ISN'T OVER WITH YET, IS IT?" LIONEL WAS TRIED, HAD HIS OWN TRIAL. THE OTHER THREE WERE TRIED TOGETHER. LIONEL LANE WAS FOUND GUILTY. LIONEL LANE IS SENTENCED TO 60 YEARS IN PRISON, BUT A JURY ACQUITS THE THREE OTHER MEN. MEANWHILE, THE SECOND MURDER REMAINS UNSOLVED, AND THE ONLY EVIDENCE POINTS TO ED TENNEY. MY BELIEF WAS ED TENNEY HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HER MURDER. HE WAS CAUGHT WITH ONE OF THE TWO GUNS THAT WAS USED AT THE OBERWEIS MURDER ABOUT 13 DAYS AFTER THE MURDER. LET'S SEE IF I CAN FIND SOMEBODY THAT TENNEY MAY HAVE TOLD ABOUT THE MURDER OF JILL OBERWEIS, AND THAT'S WHERE I WENT. ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT TENNEY WAS LIVING WITH AT THE TIME OF THE OBERWEIS MURDER WAS DONALD LIPPERT. DONALD LIPPERT AND ED TENNEY ARE COUSINS. DONNY LIPPERT HAD BEEN IN JAIL FOR A BURGLARY, SO I KNOW NOW HE'S A BURGLAR. I KNOW TENNEY'S A BURGLAR. I KNOW THESE TWO HOMES WERE BURGLARIZED WHEN THE PEOPLE WERE KILLED. I HAD A DETECTIVE ASSIGNED TO GO PICK THEM UP AND BRING THEM TO ME. DONNY CAME IN. ALL RIGHT, DONNY. OVER HERE. I BELIEVED THAT DONALD LIPPERT WAS MY PATH TO RESOLVE THE CRIME. YOU JUST KIND OF HAVE TO TALK TO HIM. GO EASY AT FIRST, LET HIM TALK. AT ONE POINT, HE STARTED QUIVERING, CRYING A LITTLE BIT. HIS WHOLE DEMEANOR CHANGED, AND NOW HE WAS A LOT QUIETER, AND THEN HE STARTED MAKING ADMISSIONS. THAT'S HUGE. I WAS CONTACTED BY DONNY LIPPERT'S FATHER. HE LED US TO TWO STORAGE UNIT PROPERTIES IN ST. CHARLES, ILLINOIS THAT HE HAD. I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO HELP HIS SON SO HE DIDN'T GET LIFE, MAYBE GET A LESSER PRISON TERM. I CAME IN HERE THE OTHER DAY AND FOUND ALL THIS STUFF. I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW. BOTH DONALD LIPPERT AND ED TENNEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE STORAGE FACILITY. BURGERT. MADONNA HIGH, 1934. HER RING. I COULDN'T HAVE WROTE THIS IN A MILLION YEARS. WITH THE DISCOVERY OF VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN'S STOLEN RING, DETECTIVES NOW BELIEVE ED TENNEY AND DONALD LIPPERT WERE INVOLVED IN HER MURDER. YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING, DONNY. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHERE LIONEL LANE FITS INTO ALL OF THIS. WHO? LIONEL LANE, THE GUY WE CHARGED WITH THE JOHANNESSEN MURDER. I DON'T KNOW NO LIONEL LANE, MAN. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO LIONEL LANE EVEN WAS. AND THEY SAID, "LIONEL, IT WASN'T YOUR GUY." OTHER THAN MY PARENTS DYING, PROBABLY THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE. NOT IN A MILLION YEARS DID I THINK LIONEL LANE WASN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR JOHANNESSEN, NOT IN A MILLION YEARS. IT WAS HARD. I PUT A GUY AWAY FOR, I THINK 60 YEARS, I THINK HE GOT. IT WAS TOUGH. SOMETIMES, THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE DON'T MOVE QUICKLY, BUT THEY DID MOVE REALLY QUICKLY RELEASING LIONEL LANE FROM PRISON. WELL, THE BOTTOM LINE, LORI HAD HER DATES WRONG. SHE WAS WITH THESE GUYS AND HER SON IN APRIL, AND THEY DID A BURGLARY, NOT THE HOMICIDE. SHE'S FOUR MONTHS OFF ON HER TIMELINE. THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. IT WAS ANOTHER INCIDENT, NOT THE HOMICIDE. WELL, ED TENNEY IS NOW IN CUSTODY AT AURORA POLICE DEPARTMENT. WE GET HIM IN AN INTERVIEW ROOM, FIND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. YOU KNOW, THERE'S STILL SOMETHING I CAN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT, ED. YEAH? WHAT'S THAT? JILL OBERWEIS' HOUSE, YOU DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING. YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF ROBBING HER, DID YOU? SO WHY'D YOU KILL HER? TENNEY WAS JUST AN EVIL, EVIL PERSON. YOU COULD SENSE THAT. HE OBVIOUSLY ENJOYED IT. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I THINK. YOU DIDN'T GO THERE TO STEAL FROM THOSE WOMEN. YOU WENT THERE TO MURDER THEM. VIRGINIA JOHANNESSEN'S RING... ...IT HAS NO VALUE. YOU DIDN'T TRY TO SELL IT. NO, YOU PUT IT IN A BOX, AND YOU KEPT IT IN STORAGE. WHY'D YOU TAKE THE RING, ED? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. THIS IS A TROPHY, ISN'T IT? ISN'T IT, ED? TROPHIES, SOUVENIRS, WHICHEVER, IT'S THE SAME CONCEPT EVEN IF THEY DON'T DARE SHOW THEM TO ANYBODY ELSE. THEY CAN LOOK AT IT AND SAY, "SEE WHAT I DID?" THIS WAS JUST A HINT OF THE KIND OF UGLY WE WERE DEALING WITH. YOU'RE NOT A THIEF. YOU'RE A SERIAL KILLER. YOU MUST THINK I'M PRETTY EVIL. EVIL ENOUGH TO LET AN INNOCENT MAN GO TO PRISON. THAT'S ON YOUR CONSCIENCE NOT MINE. WHEN TENNEY WAS CONVICTED, I WALKED INTO THE PLACE I WAS WORKING IN MADISON AT THE TIME, AND I WALKED INTO THE OFFICE THE FIRST THING THAT MORNING AND JUST TOOK THE WHITE BOARD AND JUST WROTE GUILTY, GUILTY, GUILTY ALL THE WAY ACROSS IT. AND, YOU KNOW, IT WAS VERY SATISFYING TO DO THAT. I HAVE A FAITH AND TRUST IN THE UNIVERSE. THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS PRETTY WELL SOMETIMES. I CAN HEAR HER. I CAN HEAR HER SAYING, "BARB, YOU GOT THIS." I STILL TALK TO HER. WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SAY TO YOUR MOM? I MISS YOU. I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD OF ME.
