 BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE. AND SOMETIMES, THERE IS NO REASON, AND SOMETIMES, PROBLEMS JUST FIND US. I TOLD MYSELF, "YOU CAN'T FALL APART. FALLING APART ISN'T GOING TO DO YOU ANY GOOD." - THE BODY, MISSING THE HEAD, - AN ARM, AND A HAND, WAS FOUND IN THIS WOODED AREA  OF BARRINGTON IN JANUARY. TO KNEEL DOWN NEXT TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING AND START SAWING THEIR HEAD OFF? MY REAL CONCERN WOULD BE ONCE HE HAD THAT TASTE OF BLOOD

 THAT HE WOULD KILL AGAIN. I REMEMBER CHRISTMAS OF '92, MY BROTHER WAS THE ONE THAT USUALLY HAD CHRISTMAS. BUT DEAN WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. I'M SORRY. I'LL GET CHANGED, AND WE CAN GO. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I TOLD YOUR UNCLE WE'D BE THERE OVER AN HOUR AGO. I SAID I'M SORRY. YEAH, WELL, TELL THAT TO YOUR HUNGRY COUSINS. MOM, COME ON. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU FEEL, DEAN, JUST STAY HOME TONIGHT. I DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM LEAVING HIM AT HOME ON CHRISTMAS DAY,

 BECAUSE AS DEAN'S MOTHER, I FELT DEAN NEEDED TOUGH LOVE. DEAN, I'M HOME! I BROUGHT YOU SOME LEFTOVERS. WHEN I CAME HOME, THEN DEAN WAS GONE. DEAN? I'M SORRY FOR BEING UPSET EARLIER. AT FIRST, I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HIM, BUT HE DID ALWAYS COME BACK. AND HE WAS 22 YEARS OLD. AND AFTER TWO OR THREE DAYS NOT HEARING FROM HIM, THEN I WAS CONCERNED. I BECAME AWARE OF DEAN MISSING A LITTLE AFTER CHRISTMAS. IN THE PAST, I USED TO REFER THAT THERE'S TWO DEANS. THERE'S A DEAN THAT WAS VERY SERIOUS ABOUT SCHOOL, VERY STUDIOUS -- LIKE, HE'S GETTING ALL "A"s. BUT THEN, THERE WAS ALSO THE OTHER DEAN THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE MISCHIEVOUS. MY INITIAL THING IS, "YEAH, HE'S PROBABLY OFF DOING SOME HAREBRAINED ADVENTURE. HE IS -- AND NOT JUST CALLING HOME." - Hello? - HI. BOB? IT'S YOUR AUNT MARY KAY. Hey, Mary. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN DEAN LATELY, HAVE YOU? He's still not home? You know how he is. He's probably just trying to make you nervous. THAT NEVER CROSSED MY MIND THAT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED TO DEAN. IF YOU HEAR FROM HIM, TELL HIM TO GIVE ME A CALL. BY THAT TIME, THEN I WAS TALKING TO EVERYBODY, AND THEN THAT'S WHEN THEY SAID, "YES, I SHOULD GO TO FILE A MISSING PERSONS REPORT." HAVE A SEAT RIGHT THERE. WHEN INDIVIDUALS COME INTO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO FILE A MISSING PERSONS REPORT, YOU TRY AND GET THE BEST PICTURE YOU CAN OF THE PERSON BUT ALSO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PERSON MAY BE GOING THROUGH. DO YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF YOUR SON? YES. THIS IS HIM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, RIGHT BEFORE HE GRADUATED. IS THIS SOMEBODY WHO'S UPSET WITH THE FAMILY? WAS THERE A RECENT FAMILY FIGHT, AND THEY'RE JUST NEEDING TO COOL OFF IN A GIRLFRIEND'S BASEMENT FOR A WHILE? I'LL SEND THIS AROUND. WE'LL HAVE THE OFFICERS KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR HIM. DEAN STRUCK ME AS A TYPICAL 22-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE KID. BUT EACH DAY THAT PASSES WITH NO COMMUNICATION, NOT EVEN A PHONE CALL TO MOM, THE CONCERN GETS GREATER AND GREATER. I'M SURE WE'LL FIND HIM. THANK YOU. NO PROBLEM. WEEKS PASS, AND THERE IS STILL NO SIGN OF DEAN. MARY KAY WONDERS IF SHE'LL EVER SEE HER SON AGAIN. I JUST HAD TO KEEP TELLING MYSELF I HAD TO BE OKAY. FALLING APART WAS NOT GOING TO HELP, BECAUSE I WAS IT. I GUESS I ALWAYS THOUGHT EVENTUALLY, HE WOULD BE COMING HOME. WE RECEIVED A REPORT AT OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT FROM A MOM AND HER DAUGHTER WHO WENT FOR AN AFTER-SCHOOL WALK ALONG THE RAILROAD TRACKS IN BARRINGTON AND SAW KIND OF A PINK, FLESHY THING STICKING OUT OF THE SNOW. THEY THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS SOME KIND OF DEAD ANIMAL, AND THEY WEREN'T SURE. SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE OUT THERE. WAIT. WHAT'S THAT? WHAT IS IT? AND AS I GET CLOSER, I ACTUALLY SEE THAT THERE'S AN APPENDAGE STICKING OUT, BUT THERE'S NOTHING AT THE END OF THE APPENDAGE. THERE'S NO HAND. THERE'S NO PAW. THERE'S NOTHING. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I SEE THE WAISTBAND OF SOME BLUE JEANS. NOW I KNOW THAT IT IS HUMAN REMAINS. WE NEED TO CLEAR THE AREA. WE GOT A CRIME SCENE HERE. DETECTIVES CALL IN FORENSIC SPECIALISTS TO EXAMINE THE BODY. YOU KNOW, WE WERE NEXT TO SOME RAILROAD TRACKS, SO I WAS TRYING TO THINK, "WAS THIS A VICTIM OF SOME TRAIN ACCIDENT?" COULD'VE BEEN SEVERAL DIFFERENT THINGS. WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW. AS THE E.T.s BEGAN THE EXCAVATION OF THE BODY, YOU COULD SEE THAT THE TORSO PORTION WAS WITHOUT A HEAD, WAS MISSING ITS COMPLETE LEFT ARM, AND WAS MISSING ITS RIGHT HAND. FIND A WALLET ANYWHERE? - NO. - I.D.? NO, NOTHING ON THE GROUND. YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE CHECK A POCKET. THE BODY WAS FROZEN SOLID, SO, INCLUDING, THE POCKETS WERE FROZEN SOLID. WHY DON'T WE CUT IT OPEN? ALL RIGHT. WE SLOWLY CUT THE FRONT JEAN POCKETS, AND WE FOUND A FOLDED-UP PIECE OF STATIONERY PAPER. WHAT'S IT SAY? "ROOM 34." IT LOOKS LIKE A TELEPHONE NUMBER. THE HOTEL THAT THIS PHONE NUMBER REGISTERED TO WAS PROBABLY APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES FROM BARRINGTON. - Hotel Hyperion. - HI. THIS IS DETECTIVE KEVIN CROKE FROM BARRINGTON P.D. - How can I help you? - I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME INFORMATION ABOUT A PERSON WHO MIGHT BE STAYING AT YOUR HOTEL. ROOM 34. Yeah, I rented it to a woman. She's been staying here a while now. THE MANAGER RELAYS A STORY ABOUT ONE GUEST WHO STAYED FOR OVER A MONTH. REALLY? DO YOU HAVE A NAME? Yeah, her name is Lenarczyk. - OKAY. - Nadine Lenarczyk. NADINE -- COULD YOU SPELL THE LAST NAME, PLEASE? Sure. It's L- E-N-A-R-C-Z-Y-K. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - YES? - NADINE LENARCZYK, - YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. - I DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. - WAIT, WHAT -- WHAT'S GOING ON? - ANYTHING YOU SAY OR DO CAN -- SHE WAS WANTED ON A WARRANT, WHICH WOULD GIVE US PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST HER, SO WE COULD TALK TO HER. WHAT IS THIS FOR? UPON TAKING NADINE INTO CUSTODY, AT FIRST, SHE WAS CONFUSED, AND WE WEREN'T GIVING HER TOO MUCH INFORMATION AT THAT TIME. - YOU CAN'T ARREST ME! - IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD ONE, ONE WILL BE APPOINTED TO YOU BY THE COURTS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THESE RIGHTS, NADINE? STOP! SHE TELLS US THAT SHE'S AN INFORMANT FOR THE FBI. - I'M WORKING FOR THE FBI. - WHAT? I'M NOT SURPRISED NADINE IS NOT SITTING WITH YOU AND GIVING AN INTERVIEW. MY GUESS IS SHE WANTS TO PUT THIS BEHIND HER FOREVER. AND THIS IS GOING TO BRING BACK SOME VERY BAD MEMORIES. THREE WEEKS AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF DEAN FAWCETT, DETECTIVES ARE HOPEFUL THAT FBI INFORMANT NADINE LENARCZYK MAY KNOW THE IDENTITY OF THE DEAD BODY DISCOVERED NEAR THE RAILROAD TRACKS. HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE FBI ABOUT OUR MYSTERY WOMAN? TURNS OUT NADINE'S TELLING THE TRUTH. SHE'S AN FBI INFORMANT. REALLY? WHAT'S THE CASE? THEY COULDN'T SAY. WE CONTACTED THIS FBI AGENT, AND HE ACTUALLY DID CONFIRM THAT, "YES, I AM WORKING WITH NADINE. SHE IS PROVIDING INFORMATION. SHE IS INVOLVED IN SOME OTHER CRIMES." WE EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT, AND HE SAID, "OKAY, YEAH. NO, THESE ARE COMPLETELY UNRELATED SITUATIONS." THEY REVIEWED OUR JOHN DOE CASE, AND THEY DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY CONNECTION. GAVE US THE GO-AHEAD TO QUESTION HER. THE BARRINGTON POLICE ARRESTED NADINE BECAUSE IT WAS HER HOTEL ROOM NUMBER AND PHONE NUMBER ON THE PIECE OF PAPER FOUND IN THE VICTIM'S POCKET. WELL, ALL RIGHT THEN. LET'S SEE WHAT SHE KNOWS. SHE'S AN INFORMANT WITH THE FBI, WORKING WITH SOME VERY VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS PEOPLE, SO SHE WAS, YOU KNOW, RIGHTFULLY SO, VERY KIND OF UPSET OR NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT WAS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE. I'M NOT GOING TO TALK TO YOU GUYS ABOUT THE FBI CASE. I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING TO ANYONE ABOUT IT. THAT'S FINE. WE DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY DEAL YOU HAVE WITH THE FBI. THEN WHY AM I HERE? YOU KNOW, NADINE WAS BEING VIEWED AS A WITNESS AT THIS POINT. SHE MIGHT HAVE SOME INFORMATION. YOU'RE HERE... ...BECAUSE OF HIM. YOU EVER SEEN THIS GUY BEFORE? YEAH, I KNOW HIM. AND SHE SAID, "WELL, YEAH. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DO. I KNOW A GUY -- DIDN'T KNOW HIM WELL, BUT I KNEW A GUY. I ONLY KNOW HIS FIRST NAME." WELL, I MET HIM ONCE, DEAN, AROUND CHRISTMAS. WHERE'D YOU GET THIS FROM? SEEN IT BEFORE? IT'S MY ROOM NUMBER. I WATCHED DEAN AS HE WROTE IT DOWN. THIS DEAN? YEAH. WE'RE NOW CONVINCED THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED THE VICTIM AS DEAN FAWCETT. WITH THE BODY NOW IDENTIFIED, DETECTIVES HEAD TO MARY KAY'S HOME TO DELIVER THE NEWS. DETECTIVE? HI, MARY KAY. CAN WE COME IN? YES. SO, DID YOU FIND HIM? WE DID. DEAN WAS -- I- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS. HE WAS MURDERED. MURDERED? MARY KAY, I'M SO SORRY. WE'LL FIND THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. WHY DON'T YOU COME HAVE A SEAT? WHILE YOU'RE WORKING THESE INVESTIGATIONS, YOU NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT YOU'RE WORKING FOR A FAMILY. YOU KNOW? THAT'S WHAT'S YOUR MOTIVATION. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS YOU GOING. BUT WHY IS DEAN FAWCETT DEAD, AND WHO HAS KILLED HIM? DETECTIVES CONTINUE TO PRESS NADINE FOR ANSWERS. SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD JUST MET HIM AROUND CHRISTMASTIME, AND THEY WERE DOING SOME SHOPPING AND WRITING ALL THESE BAD CHECKS. DEAN WAS BUYING A LOT OF EXPENSIVE STUFF, KNOWING THAT HIS CHECKS WOULD BOUNCE. BUT IT WASN'T HIS IDEA. SO WE ASKED NADINE WHAT ELSE SHE KNEW ABOUT THE BAD-CHECK WRITING, AND SHE SAID IT ACTUALLY STARTED WHEN TWO FRIENDS OF HERS CONTACTED HER. NADINE THEN STARTED TO TELL US MORE OF THE STORY. NADINE WAS A FRIEND OF THE MEN IN THIS CREW, PAUL MODROWSKI AND ROBERT FARACI. GUYS, WHAT DO YOU THINK? THAT IS PRETTY SAD. DEFINITELY NOT A TREE FOR SOMEONE WHO'S ABOUT TO COME INTO A LOT OF MONEY. HEY, GUYS, I'M GOING TO HEAD OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT. ALL RIGHT? I'M GOING TO TO THE STORE. YOU WANT SOMETHING? - NO, THANKS, BOBBY. - BEER? HOW ABOUT YOU? - I'M GOOD. - YOU SURE? - I'M GOOD. - ALL RIGHT, GUYS. SO, HOW DOES THIS WORK, EXACTLY? IT'S EASY. WE JUST GO CHRISTMAS SHOPPING, PAY WITH A CHECK, AND THEN BEFORE THEY REALIZE THE CHECK'S NO GOOD, WE'VE ALREADY SOLD IT OFF FOR CASH. MERRY CHRISTMAS. WHO'S WRITING THE CHECKS? UM, A FRIEND OF MINE. HIS NAME'S DEAN. DO YOU TRUST HIM? I THINK SO. IT BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT DEAN WAS JUST DESPERATE TO HAVE SOME FRIENDS AND JUST TO GET ALONG. EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE PART OF A GROUP. HE DIDN'T LIKE GETTING IN TROUBLE, BUT, YOU KNOW, HE DID LIKE HANGING OUT WITH THESE GUYS. DUDE, WE COULD AT LEAST GET A GRAND FOR THIS. WE SHOULD JUST GRAB EVERYTHING THAT'S EXPENSIVE. WHY WASTE TIME? COME ON. THIS IS AWESOME. COME ON. GET ANYTHING YOU WANT. THEY WERE USING DEAN FAWCETT. DEAN? WHAT'S WRONG? IT'S NOTHING. ME AND MY MOM JUST HAD A FIGHT. COME IN. I JUST SPENT CHRISTMAS ALONE. WELL, YOU COULD'VE COME HERE. I DON'T KNOW. LATELY, I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING ABOUT TAKING OFF AND NOT TELLING ANYONE. I MEAN, THAT WOULD SHOW HER. YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT. YOU ONLY HAVE ONE MOM. BESIDES, I DON'T THINK PAUL WOULD BE TOO THRILLED IF YOU TOOK OFF. HE STILL NEEDS YOU AND YOUR CHECKBOOK. YEAH. YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY WITH THIS FOREVER. EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S GOING TO FIND OUT. WHEN THEY DO, I'M NOT TAKING THE FALL FOR IT. DEAN TOLD NADINE, "WELL, IF I'M GETTING IN TROUBLE, I'M TAKING EVERYBODY DOWN WITH ME." WHAT DO YOU MEAN? NEVER MIND. JUST FORGET THAT I SAID IT. RIGHT. FORGOTTEN. SO NOW NADINE IS ARMED WITH THIS INFORMATION THAT DEAN MAY NOT BE AS STAND-UP OF A GUY AS THEY THOUGHT. THE BEAUTY AND MAGIC OF PICTURES, RIGHT? IT'S ALWAYS A SNAPSHOT IN TIME. BUT IT DOES SHOW HOW HAPPY HE IS AND THAT -- ...WHAT A GOOD GUY HE WAS OR IS. IF DEAN WAS STILL HERE, HE WOULD WANT ME TELLING HIS STORY. ANYTIME I REFERRED TO HIM, I ALWAYS SAID THAT HE WAS MY MIRACLE BABY. CHRISTMAS OF '92 WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW DEAN. - FAWCETT'S BODY, MISSING - THE HEAD, AN ARM, AND A HAND, WAS FOUND IN THIS WOODED AREA  OF BARRINGTON IN JANUARY. MY COUSIN, A BISHOP, HE WAS THE SPEAKER AT THE WAKE, AND HE WROTE THIS. "DON'T PLAY WITH BAD COMPANIONS. CHOOSE YOUR FRIENDS WISELY. DEAN DIDN'T." BUT WHICH OF DEAN'S FRIENDS HAS BETRAYED HIM? KEY WITNESS NADINE MAY HOLD THE ANSWER. NADINE WAS A VERY IMPORTANT WITNESS IN THIS CASE. SHE KIND OF PUT A LOT OF PIECES TOGETHER. SOMETHING REALLY STRANGE HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER CHRISTMAS. PAUL. HAVE YOU SEEN BOBBY AND DEAN ANYWHERE? I DON'T KNOW WHERE BOBBY WENT, BUT DEAN'S INSIDE. LISTEN, THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. WHAT IS IT? IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING, BUT DEAN SAID SOMETHING STRANGE -- SOMETHING LIKE IF WE GET CAUGHT, HE'S NOT GOING TO TAKE THE FALL. HE SAID THAT? NO, H-HE WAS PROBABLY JUST UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING. HE GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH HIS MOM AT CHRISTMAS. I'LL TALK TO HIM. IF YOU SEE BOBBY, YOU LET ME KNOW. HEY, PAUL. HE DIDN'T MEAN IT, PAUL. HEY, BUDDY. HI. CHECK THIS OUT. THAT'S COOL. WHAT'S IT FOR? JUST GOOD TO HAVE IT ON ME, YOU KNOW? YOU NEVER KNOW WHO YOU COULD TRUST. I CAN TRUST YOU, THOUGH, RIGHT? OF COURSE, YEAH. YOU SURE? YEAH. HEY, WHEN BOBBY COMES BACK, LET'S HOP IN MY CAR. I GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU. COOL. OKAY. NADINE NEVER SAW THAT YOUNG MAN AGAIN. THAT WAS THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 28, 1992. WHEN NADINE PASSED THE INFORMATION ALONG TO MODROWSKI, SHE PROBABLY DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE WAS... SIGNING DEAN FAWCETT'S DEATH WARRANT. WE CONTACTED MARY KAY FAWCETT SHORTLY AFTER OUR CONVERSATION WITH NADINE TO ASK HER SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HER SON. THANK YOU FOR COMING IN. OF COURSE. DID YOU GUYS FIND ANYTHING? WE HAVE A COUPLE OF NAMES. I THINK IT WAS HEADED BY A FELLA NAMED PAUL MODROWSKI. PAUL? YOU KNOW PAUL MODROWSKI? WELL, I MET HIM ONCE. HE DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME. HOW SO? HE WAS SHIFTY AND WOULDN'T LOOK ME IN THE EYE. MARY KAY FAWCETT, THE MOTHER OF DEAN FAWCETT, INFORMED US THAT SHE DIDN'T GET A REALLY GOOD VIBE FROM THIS PAUL MODROWSKI. I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING ABOUT HIM JUST DIDN'T ADD UP. WE LEARNED THAT WHAT MADE MODROWSKI A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM FARACI WAS HIS TENDENCY TOWARDS VIOLENCE. POLICE MOVE QUICKLY TO LOCATE PAUL MODROWSKI AND ROBERT FARACI, BUT THEY HAVE BOTH VANISHED. SO THE NEXT INVESTIGATIVE PATH WAS TO FIND BOB FARACI AND PAUL MODROWSKI. AND NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW WHERE THEY WERE AT. IF THEY WERE INNOCENT, THEY'D HAVE NO REASON TO FLEE. WE DECIDED TO EXPAND OUR SEARCH FOR OUR SUSPECTS NATIONWIDE. Dispatch for unit 315. GO FOR 315. Detective, we got a hit on Bob Faraci. He was picked up down in Florida. FLORIDA? OKAY, TELL THEM TO HOLD ONTO HIM. HE'S A PERSON OF INTEREST. That's going to be hard, sir. They already released him. BY THE TIME WE HAD GOTTEN THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ARREST, THOUGH, HE HAD ALREADY BONDED OUT AND WAS NO LONGER IN THE CUSTODY OF THE CLEARWATER, FLORIDA, POLICE DEPARTMENT. SO NOW, AGAIN, THE HUNT BEGINS IN EARNEST AGAIN TO TRY AND FIND OUT, "ALL RIGHT. WHERE ARE THEY AT?" LISTEN, I NEED YOU TO LET THEM KNOW THE SITUATION. WE NEED TO MOBILIZE OFFICERS AND FIND HIM. 10-4. I'm on it. SOUL OF CHRIST, BE MY SANCTIFICATION. BODY OF CHRIST, BE MY SALVATION. BLOOD OF CHRIST, FILL MY VEINS. BLOOD OF CHRIST, FILL MY VEINS. HAVING THE FAITH THAT I HAVE DID HELP ME. I DID HAVE PRAYERS. I HAD TWO PRAYERS THAT I WOULD SAY ALL THE TIME TO GET ME THROUGH THIS. BID ME COME TO THEE ABOVE WITH THY SAINTS. WORLD WITHOUT END. JUST SAY, "OKAY, LET GOD TAKE CARE OF IT." DETECTIVES BELIEVE THAT BOTH FUGITIVES HAVE ESCAPED TO FLORIDA, BUT THEY SOON LEARN THAT ROBERT FARACI IS MUCH CLOSER TO HOME. SO OUR NEXT BREAK CAME WHEN WE RECEIVED A TIP THAT ROBERT FARACI HAD RETURNED TO ILLINOIS. WE BELIEVED THESE WERE DANGEROUS PEOPLE AND THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE DEALING WITH KILLERS. EVERYTHING WAS IN PLAY AT THAT POINT. BUT WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE. AFTER MONTHS ON THE RUN, DETECTIVES LEARN THAT MURDER SUSPECT ROBERT FARACI MAY BE BACK IN ILLINOIS WITH HIS WIFE. GOOD EVENING, GENTLEMEN. HOW CAN I HELP? I'M DETECTIVE CROKE, AND THIS IS MY PARTNER. WE'RE WORKING A CASE, AND WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A PERSON OF INTEREST STAYING HERE. REALLY? THEY WERE STAYING AT A LOCAL MOTEL. WE SPOKE TO THE CLERK. HE HAD SEEN THEM LEAVE AND GO TO THE RESTAURANT, WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE MOTEL. SO WE WENT TO RESTAURANT, AND WE DID IN FACT SEE BOB SITTING IN THERE WITH ROSE. CAME BACK OUT, MADE A DECISION. "SHOULD WE MAKE A SCENE IN THE RESTAURANT, OR SHOULD WE WAIT?" WE CAN'T RISK IT. WHY DON'T YOU STAY IN THE CAR, AND I'LL COVER THE FRONT DOOR? AND WHEN THEY COME OUT, WE CAN JUMP ON THEM. ROBERT FARACI! HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD NOW. WE JUST, YOU KNOW, ANNOUNCED, "POLICE," AND, "YOU'RE UNDER ARREST," AND, "TURN AROUND," AND THEY COMPLIED WITH ALL OUR INSTRUCTIONS. HE KNEW HE WAS A SUSPECT, SO I THINK HE KNEW IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE WAS GOING TO GET ARRESTED. THIS NORTHWEST SUBURBAN MAN IS THE CENTER OF ALL  THE RECENT ATTENTION. 25-YEAR-OLD ROBERT FARACI  OF NORRIDGE IS CHARGED IN THE MURDER  OF 22-YEAR-OLD DEAN FAWCETT OF LA GRANGE PARK. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? DEAN FAWCETT. WHAT ABOUT HIM? WE KNOW ABOUT THE CHECK FRAUD. WE KNOW ABOUT YOU. WE KNOW ABOUT PAUL, AND WE KNOW ABOUT NADINE. DEAN IS DEAD. I WANT TO KNOW WHY. LOOK, PAUL IS CRAZY. ALL RIGHT? AFTER A WHILE, HE STARTED GETTING PARANOID. IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE HE THOUGHT DEAN WAS GOING TO RAT US OUT IF THE COPS NABBED HIM. SO HE DECIDED TO KILL HIM? DEAN WAS THE WITNESS THAT WOULD BRING THEM ALL DOWN WITH HIM. YOU KNOW, WOULD THEY HAVE GONE TO PRISON FOR THIS? MAYBE. BUT IN MODROWSKI'S WORLD, YOU PREVENT HIM FROM EVER BECOMING A WITNESS AGAINST YOU. LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. OKAY. I UNDERSTAND. BUT WHAT HAPPENED? YEAH, THIS IS STUPID, PAUL. WHY DON'T YOU GUYS SHUT UP AND JUST DO AS I SAY, OKAY? SCREW THIS, MAN. I'M OUT OF HERE. IT'S FREEZING. LET'S JUST GO BACK. NO GOING BACK. I THINK MAYBE THE VERY FIRST TIME DEAN HAD AN INKLING THAT, "SOMETHING REALLY SERIOUS IS HAPPENING NOW." WHY? WHAT'S THIS ABOUT? - GET ON THE GROUND. - WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? I'M NOT GOING TO LET A LITTLE RAT LIKE YOU TAKE ME OUT! WHAT ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT? GET ON THE GROUND! THEY WALK DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE EMBANKMENT. PAUL PULLS OUT THE 9mm AND JUST SIMPLY ORDERS DEAN TO GET ON THE GROUND, LAY DOWN. I P-PROMISED I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING. I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT YOU. - I PROMISED I WOULDN'T -- - GET DOWN! ALL THE WAY! AND AGAIN, DEAN BEING DEAN, HE OBEYS THE ORDERS. PLEASE! I DON'T WANT TO -- JUST PLEASE DON'T SHOOT! HE WAS BEGGING FOR HIS LIFE, MODROWSKI, WITH GUN IN HAND, POINTED AT HIM, DEMANDING TO KNOW, "WHAT DID YOU TELL THE POLICE?" IT'S TOO LATE! I'VE MADE UP MY MIND. AND DEAN DENIED EVERYTHING, BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. PLEASE! PLEASE! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE. NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE COMING TO HELP ME FINISH THIS. BOB BLAMED PAUL MODROWSKI FOR BEING THE MONSTER IN THIS, AND IN FACT, BOB SAID HE WAS EVEN SCARED OF PAUL. SO THAT'S YOUR STATEMENT, THEN? LOOK, I -- I SAID WHAT I SAID. AND, WHILE HE PARTICIPATED IN THE CRIME, THAT HE ONLY DID SO BECAUSE HE FEARED FOR HIS OWN SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF HIS WIFE. WE'LL BE BACK IN 5. MODROWSKI CUT OFF DEAN'S HEAD. HE CUT OFF DEAN'S LEFT ARM AND CUT OFF DEAN'S RIGHT HAND WITH A SAW. MODROWSKI, WITH THOSE BODY PARTS, LEFT DEAN FAWCETT ON THAT RAILROAD EMBANKMENT, SO DEAN'S HEAD AND HANDS WERE NEVER FOUND AGAIN. AND NOW THE SEARCH FOR PAUL MODROWSKI REALLY INTENSIFIED. - POLICE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR - ANOTHER SUSPECT IN THE CASE. IT'S JUST KIND OF SCARY TO THINK ABOUT SOME PERSON IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD COULD DO THAT. WELL, HE HANGS AROUND WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAN I DO, 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW PEOPLE WHO WALK AROUND EVERY DAY SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO SHOOT PEOPLE. FOUR MONTHS AFTER DEAN'S MURDER, POLICE APPREHEND PAUL MODROWSKI NEAR A RELATIVE'S HOME IN CHICAGO. - 18-YEAR-OLD PAUL MODROWSKI - SPORTED A CLEAN-SHAVEN FACE AND A BRAND-NEW HAIRCUT AS  HE LEFT JAIL FOR COURT TODAY, BUT COPS SAY HE'S ANYTHING BUT  THE CLEAN-CUT BOY NEXT DOOR. HE'S BEEN CHARGED  WITH THE MUTILATION-MURDER OF THIS MAN --   22-YEAR-OLD DEAN FAWCETT. DETECTIVES DIG INTO PAUL MODROWSKI'S PAST, AND WHAT THEY UNCOVER IS TERRIFYING. AS A TEENAGER, HE USED TO MUTILATE ANIMALS, AND HE WOULD TAKE PLEASURE OUT OF CUTTING UP SMALL ANIMALS AND TORTURING SMALL ANIMALS. SO TORTURING A HUMAN I THINK WOULD GIVE HIM THE SAME TYPE OF PLEASURE THAT HE GOT FROM TORTURING LITTLE ANIMALS. HE WAS VERY INTIMIDATING. LIKE, WHEN HE WALKED DOWN THE HALLS OF THE SCHOOL, THEY JUST PARTED LIKE THE RED SEA. NOBODY WANTED ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND BASICALLY WERE AFRAID OF HIM. I WOULD DESCRIBE PAUL MODROWSKI AS FRANKENSTEIN, BUT THEN, EVEN THEN, EVEN FRANKENSTEIN HAD A HEART. PAUL MODROWSKI HAD ICE IN HIS VEINS. - POLICE PLAN TO CALL THIS MAN, - 25-YEAR-OLD ROBERT FARACI, BEFORE A GRAND JURY  INVESTIGATING THE CASE. FARACI HAS ALSO BEEN CHARGED  IN THE BARRINGTON MURDER. AND AS A RESULT OF THE JURORS BEING ABLE TO LISTEN TO BOBBY ON THE STAND IN TEARS, CRYING ABOUT HOW SCARED HE WAS FROM PAUL MODROWSKI, THE JURORS BOUGHT INTO THAT. AND THEY ULTIMATELY SIDED WITH HIS STORY, AND THEY ACQUITTED HIM OF THE MURDER CHARGES, AND BOB FARACI WAS SET FREE. WE WERE ALL STUNNED. THERE WERE, YOU KNOW, UNCOMFORTABLE... QUESTIONS WITHOUT ANSWERS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE WITH THE BURDEN OF PROOF, MANY TIMES, THERE IS A NOT-GUILTY VERDICT. I PROMISED I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING! PLEASE! PLEASE! IN A SEPARATE TRIAL, PAUL MODROWSKI IS FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER, BUT HE DISPUTES FARACI'S VERSION OF EVENTS AND MAINTAINS HIS INNOCENCE TO THIS DAY. IF PAUL MODROWSKI WAS NOT ARRESTED FOR THE MURDER OF DEAN FAWCETT, IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THAT HE WOULD HAVE COMMITTED MORE VIOLENT CRIMES AND POSSIBLY MURDER. COLD-BLOODED KILLER. VIOLENT FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE. NOT ONE SHRED OF EMOTION. CALM, COOL, COLLECTED. HE WAS ALMOST NONHUMAN. WHEN DEAN WAS MISSING, I WENT INTO HIS ROOM, AND IN A DRAWER, I FOUND A PAPER THAT HE HAD WRITTEN. IT SOUNDS LIKE THINGS WERE GOING ON, BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF IT. "WE ARE ALL HERE BUT JUST ONE TIME. NO ONE KNOWS HOW. THIS IS THE PLACE ONE ALMIGHTY CREATOR TESTS YOU. HE EVEN GAVE A SON. THIS GIVES US A SECOND CHANCE. DOES THIS MAKE SENSE? BECAUSE IF IT DOES, I THINK IT MEANS TWO THINGS. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ME, AND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I BELIEVE IN." AND AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE, DEAN HAD PRINTED, "HEAVEN." OKAY? YEP, I HAVE NOT READ THAT IN A LONG TIME, SO THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT PART. OKAY? NO. NO ONE EVER DIED IN MY FAMILY THAT I WAS SO CLOSE TO. THERE WAS A SENSE OF -- I WANTED JUSTICE OR VENGEANCE, BUT JESUS CHRIST'S SACRIFICE APPLIES TO THEM JUST AS MUCH TO ME AND TO MY COUSIN, SO I... ...YOU KNOW, ALSO HAVE TO FORGIVE THEM. MODROWSKI HAS LOST ALL HIS APPEALS, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, AND WILL BE IN JAIL FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. AND AT FIRST, I THOUGHT THE DEATH PENALTY, BUT THEN AFTER I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, I THOUGHT THAT WAS ALMOST TOO GOOD FOR HIM -- THAT FOR WHAT HE DID, THEN HE SHOULD JUST, EVERY DAY, THINK ABOUT IT. MARY KAY DESERVED A LOT BETTER. HER ONLY CHILD WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM HER, AND SHE HAS HAD TO LIVE THE REST OF HER LIFE WITHOUT HER SON IN IT. IT'S WHY PROSECUTORS DO WHAT THEY DO. IT'S FOR THEM. IT'S FOR THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT'S NOT FOR US.
