 [ WIND BLOWING, BIRDS CAWING ] Carol: TODAY, I'M FEELING NERVES, AND I HAVE FOR A WEEK OR TWO. IT'S JUST A VERY HARD THING FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT. THOSE ARE THINGS YOU DON'T LIKE TO EVEN REMEMBER. IT WAS WICKED, REALLY. ?? ?? Howard: IT'S BEEN OVER 40 YEARS SINCE WE WENT THROUGH THIS EPISODE, BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU JUST DON'T FORGET. IT WAS A PAINFUL, IT WAS A DESTRUCTIVE,

 IT WAS AN EVIL EXPERIENCE. IT'S AS IF SOMEBODY CAME DOWN AND PICKED HER OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. SHE JUST DISAPPEARED. ?? Carol: IT'S JUST LIKE YOU'RE BEING RIPPED APART, REALLY. I- I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS HAPPENING TO US. Tighe: A BODY COULD BE JUST COVERED WITH SNOW. WE HAD NO IDEA WHERE SHE WAS -- ALIVE OR DEAD. ?? [ BIRDS CAWING ] ?? I SEE HER BLOND HAIR FIRST, YOU KNOW, DOWN A WAYS, AND HER SMILE.

 PEOPLE WANTED TO BE WITH LINDA. SHE WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT SCHOOL. IT WAS NICE TO SEE. ?? I DROVE HER TO HER FIRST ROOM AT COLLEGE. ?? ?? MOM, ARE YOU OKAY? I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS... UNPACKING ALL THESE THINGS JUST BRINGS BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES. I HAD TEARS IN MY EYES. [ GASPS ] OH, LOOK! [ GASPS ] IT'S MR. WHISKERS. [ CHUCKLES ] I'VE HAD THIS SINCE FOREVER. I WAS ONE WHO ALWAYS SAID, "LET YOUR CHILDREN GO." AND I WAS GLAD SHE COULD. MOM, STOP. I'M GONNA BE HOME FOR THANKSGIVING... AND CHRISTMAS. [ CHUCKLES ] I KNOW. I KNOW. BESIDES, I WILL HAVE MR. WHISKERS TO PROTECT ME. [ BOTH LAUGH ] [ WIND BLOWING ] ?? Woman: SMELLS SO GOOD. THANK YOU, REVEREND. Howard: PLEASE, CALL ME HOWARD. AND YOU CAN THANK CAROL. SHE'S THE QUEEN OF THE CASSEROLE. WE WERE HAVING DINNER IN OUR HOME WITH SOME VERY CLOSE FRIENDS. MM, BETTER TASTE IT BEFORE WE START HANDING OUT THE ROYAL TITLES. [ LAUGHING ] I REMEMBER GETTING THE PHONE CALL. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] OH, GEE. I BETTER GRAB THAT. HELLO. HOWARD VELZY. WE WERE NOTIFIED BY CAMPUS SECURITY THAT LINDA WAS MISSING. SHE HAD BEEN ON A STUDY DATE WITH HER BOYFRIEND IN THE AFTERNOON, AND SHE HAD EXCUSED HERSELF TO GO DOWN TO TOWN TO BUY A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR HER MOTHER, AND SHE DIDN'T RETURN TO CAMPUS. AND HER ROOMMATE REPORTED HER MISSING. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. IT'S NOT LIKE LINDA TO JUST LEAVE. THE FEELINGS I HAD -- PROBABLY THE FIRST WAS DENIAL. "YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE FACTS STRAIGHT. THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING. YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GIRL" OR "YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG INFORMATION" OR WHATEVER. WHEN THEY INFORMED ME THAT SHE HAD BEEN MISSING SINCE FRIDAY NIGHT -- AND THIS WAS SATURDAY NIGHT -- LIKE, "WHAT ARE YOU CALLING ME NOW FOR?" THAT WAS LIKE 24 HOURS AGO. WHY WOULD YOU WAIT SO LONG TO LET US KNOW? NO, SOMETHING'S WRONG. SHE -- SHE -- IF SHE WAS GOING SOMEWHERE, SHE WOULD TELL SOMEONE. THE UNIVERSITY'S POLICY WAS TO WAIT 24 HOURS IF SOMEBODY WAS REPORTED MISSING, SO THEY DIDN'T CALL US UNTIL SATURDAY NIGHT. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO REACT? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT THIS? AND THEN, HOW DO I EXPLAIN THIS TO CAROL? I GOT TO TELL HER SOMETHING. WHAT DO I TELL HER? ?? ?? Jim: LINDA TALKED TO PEOPLE. SHE -- SHE WASN'T, LIKE, SECRETIVE OR, YOU KNOW, DOING THINGS ON THE SLY. I JUST KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG. Rick: YEAH, WE -- WE -- THAT'S THE WAY IT HIT ME, TOO, IS, THIS WAS VERY UNCHARACTERISTIC OF HER. YOU KNOW, THAT MADE NO SENSE AT ALL. ?? [ WIND BLOWING ] Carol: I CRIED ALL NIGHT. I HAD A SENSE THEN, EVEN THOUGH I DON'T THINK I'VE EVEN SAID IT TO ANYBODY, THAT THIS WAS NOT GOOD. THIS WAS REALLY NOT GOOD. Howard: SOMETHING'S WRONG. WE'VE GOT TO GET UP THERE AND START ASKING QUESTIONS. ?? ?? Narrator: THE NEXT MORNING, HOWARD AND CAROL DRIVE 200 MILES NORTH TO ONEONTA. Howard: LISTEN. WE'RE GONNA FIND HER. OKAY? LET'S TRY NOT TO PANIC. I- I-I KNOW. I- I JUST WISH I WAS PAYING MORE ATTENTION. I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE COULD HAVE GONE. FOR HER BOYFRIEND NOT TO KNOW WHERE SHE WAS MADE NO SENSE AT ALL. HAVE YOU TALKED TO HER FRIENDS? YES, MRS. VELZY -- ALL THE ONES I KNOW, AT LEAST. HOW ABOUT HER ROOMMATE? WHEN DID SHE GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU? UM, SHE GOT IN TOUCH -- UM, I-I DON'T REMEMBER, HONESTLY. UM, UH, SOON AFTER... [ CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY ] Carol: IT WAS A FEELING OF ABSOLUTE DISTRESS. I- I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT. [ INDISTINCT TALKING ] ?? EVERYBODY AGREED THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD SOMEONE IF SHE WERE GOING AWAY. HOWARD. HER CONTACTS. WE FOUND OUT THAT SHE'D LEFT HER CONTACT LENSES THERE. AND IT JUST WASN'T LIKE LINDA TO LEAVE THINGS. IT JUST SEEMED SINISTER TO ME. AND IT -- I DIDN'T LOSE THAT FEELING. OH, WE SHOULD TELL THE STATE TROOPERS ABOUT THAT. YOU SHOULD COME WITH US. THE -- THE TROOPERS? YEAH. THEY -- THEY ALREADY CAME. THEY ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS SINCE I WAS THE LAST TO SEE HER ON CAMPUS. Howard: HE WAS CONSIDERED A SUSPECT BECAUSE HE WAS THE LAST PERSON TO SEE HER. BUT HE SAID, YOU KNOW, "I LIKED HER. WHY WOULD I DO ANYTHING? I MEAN, WE WERE GETTING ALONG FINE." Tighe: EARLY IN THE INVESTIGATION, WE HAD TO INTERVIEW HER BOYFRIEND BECAUSE HE WAS GONNA MEET HER THAT EVENING, AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES. EVERY LEAD YOU GET, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT. [ DOG BARKS, BIRD CAWS ] ?? "MISSING PERSON -- LINDA VELZY, 5'5", LONG BLOND HAIR, BLUE EYES, 18 YEARS OF AGE, LAST SEEN WEARING A BLACK COAT WITH A HOOD, BLUE JEANS, STRING BRACELET WITH LIGHT BLUE BEADS ON RIGHT WRIST." SHE HAD LEFT THE AFTERNOON OF THE 9th TO GO DOWNTOWN TO ONEONTA TO BUY A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR HER MOTHER. AND THEN SHE WAS GONNA GO OVER TO CHESTNUT STREET TO LOOK AT A ROOM THAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT RENTING FOR THE NEXT SEMESTER. WHEN LINDA WAS HERE, DID SHE SEEM ANXIOUS OR MAYBE IN A HURRY? NO. I WOULDN'T SAY SHE SEEMED ANXIOUS. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT TIME SHE LEFT? YEAH. IT WAS -- IT WAS JUST BEFORE 6:00. I THINK SHE MENTIONED WALKING BACK TO CAMPUS OR HITCHING A RIDE. SHE SAID THAT? Tighe: THE ROAD TO THE CAMPUS GOES UP A RATHER STEEP HILL. IT WAS SNOWING THAT AFTERNOON, SO PROBABLY WAS A LITTLE SLIPPERY IN SPOTS. AND SO, SHE MIGHT HAVE JUST FELT SAFER IN CATCHING A RIDE THAN WALKING UP THE HILL. I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU THINK SHE'S OKAY? YEAH, I'M SURE SHE'S FINE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP. AND KEEP AN EYE OUT, OKAY? ?? AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE HAD GOTTEN TOGETHER AT CAMP ON THANKSGIVING, AND I REMEMBER HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH HER. I THINK SHE BROUGHT UP THE SUBJECT ABOUT HITCHHIKING, AND I REMEMBER TELLING HER, "LINDA, I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO HITCHHIKE." LINDA... YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT. THAT'S DANGEROUS. NO, DAD. IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT THAT DANGEROUS. I MEAN, LIKE, IT'S LESS THAN A MILE. I TOLD HER I DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA. DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I COULD HAVE DONE AS A PARENT. AT THIS POINT IN THE INVESTIGATION, WE WEREN'T CERTAIN THAT SHE WAS HITCHHIKING. WE DECIDED WE WOULD USE DOGS TO TRY TO FIND HER. WE WENT TO CHESTNUT STREET AND MET THE BLOODHOUND HANDLER. HE HAD SOME SCENT MATERIAL THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED BY A ROOMMATE FROM HER DORM ROOM. AND HE LET THE DOG SMELL THE SCENT MATERIAL, AND THEN HE WENT OUT THE FRONT DOOR AND DOWN THE STAIRS. THEN THE DOG LOST THE SCENT, WHICH IS INDICATIVE THAT A VEHICLE PROBABLY PICKED HER UP THERE. Howard: SHE COULD HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED. SHE COULD HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED, MOVED SOMEWHERE. SHE HADN'T GONE AWAY VOLUNTARILY. Narrator: IF LINDA IS ALIVE, THE BRUTAL WEATHER MEANS HER LIFE MAY BE IN DANGER. Tighe: THE ONEONTA AREA GETS HARSH WINTERS -- A LOT OF SNOW, COLD TEMPERATURES. SHE'D HAVE TO BE INSIDE SOMEPLACE, BECAUSE IT WAS BELOW ZERO SOMETIMES. SHE WOULDN'T HAVE SUSTAINED LIFE TOO LONG IN THE TEMPERATURES AT THE TIME. IN ANY CASE LIKE THIS, YOU WANT TO FIND THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, AND SO, THE QUICKER YOU CAN MOVE, THE BETTER. WE'VE THOUGHT OF EVERY POSSIBLE THING AT THIS POINT. WE'RE VERY REALISTIC. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL. I HAD NO IDEA, YOU KNOW, HOW THINGS WOULD TURN OUT. WHO KNEW? MAYBE A MIRACLE'D HAPPEN. [ WIND BLOWING ] ?? FOR A LONG TIME, I WOULD WAKE UP AND THINK IT WAS A DREAM THAT I WAS HAVING. YOU'RE LIVING, YOU'RE WALKING AROUND, BUT YOU'RE REALLY HALF DEAD. YOU CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE. NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. Tighe: REVEREND VELZY WAS A GOOD FATHER, AND HE WANTED TO DO ANYTHING HE COULD TO HELP FIND HIS DAUGHTER, BECAUSE SHE'D BEEN MISSING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS. NOBODY DID. H- HOWARD, WHAT ARE YOU -- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THINKING. WHEN I'M FACED WITH A PROBLEM, I DON'T REST UNTIL I FIND A SOLUTION. SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE. WHAT IF WE GOT THE NEWS INVOLVED? LIKE, USE THE MEDIA TO -- TO HELP SPREAD THE WORD. YOU THINK THAT COULD WORK? WE THOUGHT MAYBE THAT WOULD GET SOME ATTENTION, BECAUSE WE WEREN'T GETTING ANY ATTENTION. I THINK I KNOW SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP. NOBODY CARED. WASN'T EVEN NEWSWORTHY. [ TALKING INDISTINCTLY ] SO, WHAT HAPPENED WAS, ONE OF MY PARISHIONER'S FATHER HAD BEEN A CAMERAMAN FOR "60 MINUTES." AND HE SAYS, "CAN I BE OF ANY HELP?" WELL, THAT'S WHEN THINGS BEGAN TO HAPPEN. LINDA VELZY WAS LAST SEEN HERE ON WEST STREET IN ONEONTA ABOUT 6:00 ON THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER 9th. SHE WAS CARRYING A LARGE PACKAGE -- A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR HER MOTHER. THIS WAS NATIONAL NEWS AT THIS POINT. WE HAD 26 BCI DETECTIVES ALL OVER THE STATE OF NEW YORK DESCEND ON ONEONTA WITHIN A MATTER OF, LITERALLY, HOURS, AND THEY HAD THOUSANDS OF LEADS COMING 'CAUSE NOW WE WERE NOW A MEDIA BLITZ. Tighe: IF SOMEBODY SAID THEY THOUGHT THEY SAW HER DOWN IN BINGHAMTON, SOMEBODY WENT TO BINGHAMTON. NO MATTER HOW FARFETCHED -- I MEAN, EVERYTHING FROM THE PSYCHICS TO THE TRACKING DOGS THAT PEOPLE VOLUNTEERED, THEY WERE ALL ADDRESSED. [ STATIC CRACKLES ] Man: ANYONE WITH INFORMATION ON LINDA VELZY'S WHEREABOUTS IS URGED TO CALL  NEW YORK STATE TROOPERS IN THE ONEONTA OFFICE. Narrator: THE SEARCH FOR LINDA SPREADS, BUT THE TERRAIN MAKES THE JOB DIFFICULT. ONEONTA IS IN OTSEGO COUNTY IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. IT'S A VALLEY BETWEEN ROLLING HILLS, AND, IN FACT, THE CITY OF THE MOUNTAINS -- THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT. Howard: THEY'RE BACK ROADS, DEAD-END ROADS. IN UPSTATE NEW YORK, YOU CAN DUMP SOMEBODY, AND THERE'S NOBODY AROUND FOR MILES. SO, I MEAN, TRYING TO HIDE A BODY, [CHUCKLES] THAT'S NO TRICK AT ALL. Tighe: WE HAD NO IDEA WHERE SHE WAS -- ALIVE OR DEAD. A BODY COULD BE JUST COVERED WITH SNOW. IT COULD HAVE JUST BEEN THROWN OUT OF THE CAR AND COVERED WITH SNOW, AND YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T FIND IT TILL SPRING UNLESS YOU HAD A TIP WHERE IT WAS. ?? [ RINGING ] DETECTIVE TIGHE, STATE POLICE. Tighe: WE GOT A CALL FROM THE WATER SUPERINTENDENT FOR ONEONTA AND SAID THAT THE BACTERIA COUNT WAS UP IN THE RESERVOIR, AND THAT WOULD BE INDICATIVE OF A DECOMPOSING BODY. TO US, IT WAS A GOOD POSSIBILITY THAT HER BODY WAS THERE. OKAY. WE'LL PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER. SO THE DIVING DETAIL WAS BROUGHT UP, AND THEY DOVE UNDER THE ICE, WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS... [ TELEPHONE RECEIVER CLICKS ] ...BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER THE ICE, AND IF THEY DON'T FIND THE HOLE, THEY'RE NOT COMING UP. IT WASN'T A JOB THAT I'D WANT TO DO. THEY SEARCHED FOR TWO DAYS, AND NOTHING WAS FOUND. IT'S DISAPPOINTING WHEN IT TURNS OUT THERE'S NOTHING, BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. THERE'S A LOT OF DISAPPOINTMENTS IN INVESTIGATIONS. HER BOYFRIEND WAS INTERVIEWED, AND HIS STATEMENTS WERE CHECKED OUT. Howard: THERE WAS NOTHING, NOTHING THAT WOULD HAVE INDICATED AT ALL HIS INVOLVEMENT. IT WAS A GOOD LEAD AT THE TIME UNTIL HE WAS RULED OUT. Narrator: FRUSTRATED, DETECTIVES TRY A NEW APPROACH. Man: LOOK, NOBODY'S POINTING ANY FINGERS. WE JUST HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTIONS. I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME. Tighe: PAROLE OFFICERS CONTACTED FOR THAT AREA AND GET A LIST OF PAROLEES THAT WERE INCARCERATED FOR SEX-RELATED INCIDENTS, AND THERE WERE A LARGE NUMBER OF PREVIOUS OFFENDERS THAT HAD TO BE INTERVIEWED. OKAY, YOU'RE FREE TO GO. ?? ?? MR. KNAPP, HAVE A SEAT. ?? ONE OF THE SUBJECTS THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT WAS 26-YEAR-OLD RICKY KNAPP. WE'RE WORKING ON A MISSING-PERSONS CASE INVOLVING A YOUNG WOMAN. RICKY KNAPP WAS OUT ON BAIL FOR AN INCIDENT INVOLVING ANOTHER CO-ED. AND SHE WAS WALKING UP WHAT THEY CALL A COW PATH, WHICH IS A TRAIL UP THE HILL UP TO THE CAMPUS. IT'S A SHORTCUT. AND SHE WAS WALKING UP THAT AND HE WAS HIDING IN THE BUSHES AND HE JUMPED OUT AND GRABBED HER. YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS? WHAT ABOUT IT? WELL, YOU RAPED THIS GIRL. TERRORIZED HER. NOW, TWO WEEKS LATER, ANOTHER CO-ED, LINDA VELZY, HAS GONE MISSING. YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT, WOULD YOU? WHY WOULD I DO ANYTHING WHEN YOU GUYS ARE ALREADY WATCHING ME? IT WAS ONLY, LIKE, THREE OR FOUR WEEKS BEFORE THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED. HE WAS OUT ON BAIL, AND, UH... THE M.O. WOULD FIT THIS PICTURE, TOO. ON THE 9th, WERE YOU ANYWHERE NEAR CHESTNUT STREET? CHESTNUT? ACTUALLY, YES. I WAS DRIVING UP CHESTNUT, AND I SAW THIS GIRL WALKING OUT THERE. IT WAS FREEZING. SO, I FIGURED I'D HELP HER OUT. HE WAS GOING UP WEST STREET, AND HE SAID HE SAW A HITCHHIKER, BUT SHE WAS WEARING A WHITE COAT AND SHE HAD DARK HAIR. IT WAS JUST THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT DESCRIBED LINDA. AND HE SAID HE STOPPED AND ASKED HER IF SHE WANTED A RIDE, AND SHE SAID NO. AND HE SAID, "I WENT ON MY WAY." WOULD YOU MIND COMING BACK TOMORROW AND TAKING A LIE-DETECTOR TEST? WHATEVER YOU NEED, DETECTIVE. I GOT NOTHING TO HIDE. WE DONE HERE? FOR NOW. BUT THEN, THE NEXT NIGHT, HE DIDN'T CALL. ANOTHER INVESTIGATOR GOT AHOLD OF HIM, AND HE SAID, "AH, MY ATTORNEY TOLD ME NOT TO TAKE IT, NOT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS, SO I'M NOT GONNA." AFTER HIS ATTORNEY MADE THE CALLS TO THE STATE POLICE AND THE ONEONTA POLICE, HE WAS BASICALLY OFF-LIMITS, SO WE WEREN'T ABLE TO INTERVIEW HIM OR DO A POLYGRAPH OR ANYTHING. WE HAD NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS INVOLVED WITH LINDA VELZY, AND WE, IN FACT, DIDN'T KNOW IF SHE WAS EVEN DECEASED. WE HAD NO BODY, SO WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO GO ON. WE WERE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF OPTIONS. SO, I HAD NO REASON TO SUSPECT ANYBODY ELSE -- EVEN CONSIDER ANYBODY ELSE. HE WAS OBVIOUSLY SICK. HE WAS OBVIOUSLY SEXUALLY PERVERTED. BUT THE QUESTION WAS, WOULD I EVER SEE HER AGAIN? AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING? WHAT WAS SHE GOING THROUGH? [ ANIMAL HOWLING ] HE WAS NOT A NAIVE TEENAGER. HE'S AN EX-CON. HE KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND. SO, WHAT'S A DETECTIVE GOING TO DO? ?? ?? DETECTIVE. MIND IF I COME IN? OKAY. ?? ?? WHAT'S GOING ON? WE, UH, TALKED TO RICKY. WHAT'D HE SAY? HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. UNFORTUNATELY, HE'S... HE'S LAWYERED UP. ?? [ SLAPS BED, EXHALES SHARPLY ] SO, WHAT DO WE DO NEXT? WE KEEP LOOKING. BUT AS FAR AS RICKY GOES... OUR HANDS ARE TIED. WE'D COME TO THE POINT WHERE WE WERE LOSING CONFIDENCE THAT WE WOULD EVER HAVE A SOLUTION -- KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED -- AND WE MAY NEVER FIND OUT. ?? [ MUSIC STOPS ] I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA. ?? Howard: I'M A PERSON OF FAITH, AND SO, I HELD ON TO THE BELIEF THAT MAYBE SHE'D SHOW UP. BUT I DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE IT. WE KNEW -- WE KNEW OUR LIVES HAD CHANGED. WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW. I THINK OUR FAITH GROUNDED US ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT GOD WAS THERE WITH US AND THAT GOD WAS CRYING WITH US. I NEVER GAVE UP HOPE, BUT IT WAS JUST TOO MANY SIGNS THAT THINGS WERE NOT RIGHT. Narrator: LINDA'S BROTHERS ARRIVE IN TOWN TO JOIN THE SEARCH. Rick: WE DROVE UP TO ONEONTA, TOO. MY PARENTS WERE ALREADY UP THERE. WE THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU KNOW, WE COULD -- FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. RIGHT. WE WENT THROUGH THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. WE ACTUALLY KNOCKED ON THE DOORS OF THE HOUSES, ASKING THE PEOPLE IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING. YOU KNOW, YOU JUST -- YOU WANTED TO DO SOMETHING. YOU WANTED TO KNOW, AND THERE WAS JUST NO INFORMATION AT ALL. AND AFTER TWO OR THREE DAYS, I THINK WE JUST KIND OF FIGURED THERE WASN'T -- WE WEREN'T REALLY ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING. ?? Narrator: INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEGUN TO FOCUS ON 26-YEAR-OLD TREE SURGEON RICKY KNAPP. Tighe: WE HAD NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS INVOLVED WITH LINDA VELZY. WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO GO ON. ALTHOUGH WE SUSPECTED AND HE WAS OUR PRIMARY SUSPECT BY THIS POINT, THERE'S NOTHING WE COULD DO OTHER THAN JUST KEEP FOLLOWING LEADS AND KEEPING AN EYE ON HIM. YOU THINK RICKY KNOWS WE'RE WATCHING HIM? HE'S CERTAINLY STAYING OUT OF TROUBLE. SO EITHER HE KNOWS WE'RE ONTO HIM... OR ELSE HE'S TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF. [ LAUGHS ] I DOUBT IT. IS THAT ARTHUR HITT? WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING HERE? THINK WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT. Tighe: ARTHUR HITT WAS A SELF-EMPLOYED LOGGER. HE WORKED ON OCCASION WITH RICKY KNAPP. AND HE HAD SOME BRUSHES WITH THE LAW -- IN FACT, HAD A ROBBERY PENDING AT THE TIME. WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT THE LAST PERSON I EXPECT TO SEE IN HERE, ARTHUR. YOU KNOW THE COLLEGE GIRL THAT'S GONE MISSING? I MIGHT HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON HER. THINK... MAYBE YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN...MAKING A TRADE. LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO. THEY WERE GONNA REDUCE HIS CHARGES TO MISDEMEANORS -- PUNISHABLE BY A MAXIMUM OF ONE YEAR IN JAIL, IN THE COUNTY JAIL, SO IT'S GREAT REDUCTION FROM A FELONY AND GOING TO ATTICA OR SOMEPLACE. OKAY, ARTHUR, THIS BETTER BE GOOD. WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW? OKAY. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO RICKY. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PIECES OF INFORMATION THAT HITT PROVIDED WAS THAT RICKY KNAPP HAD ASKED HIM TO SAY HE WAS WITH HIM ON THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER 9th UNTIL 8:00 P.M. BUT HE DIDN'T SAY WHY. HAS HE SAID ANYTHING ABOUT LINDA VELZY? COME ON, ARTHUR. I'M GONNA NEED MORE THAN THIS. I'VE GIVING YOU ALL THAT I GOT. LOOK, THIS IS A TWO-WAY STREET. IF I'M GONNA HELP YOU, I NEED MORE. OUR HOPE WAS THAT ARTHUR HITT COULD GET RICKY TO CONFESS, BUT ANY INFORMATION THAT HE COULD PROVIDE US WITH WOULD BE MORE THAN WHAT WE HAD, BECAUSE WE COULDN'T EVEN TALK TO RICKY KNAPP. WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? I NEED SOMETHING ON TAPE. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BUILD HIS TRUST. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WEAR A WIRE. WE WIRED HIM WITH A BODY WIRE, AND HE MET RICKY IN A BAR IN WEST ONEONTA, NOT TOO FAR FROM RICKY'S HOUSE. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] SO, YOU REALLY THINK THE COPS ARE WATCHING YOU, HUH? I KNOW MARKED CARS. ONE WILL FOLLOW ME FOR A FEW BLOCKS AND TURN. A MINUTE LATER, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE FOLLOWING. PROBABLY OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE NOT WORRIED AT ALL? [ CHUCKLES ] WHAT DO I GOT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT? I DON'T KNOW. I-I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M, UM -- I'M ASKING YOU. WHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED? I'M JUST SAYING, IF, UH -- IF THEY START FOLLOWING ME, I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE, RIGHT? ?? ?? AND THEY HAD A CONVERSATION, BUT THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT, NOTHING MUCH WAS ENLIGHTENING. The coolest way to improve your English ?0?4\_(??)_/?0?4 skeebdo.com ?0?4\_(??)_/?0?4 WE ASSUMED THAT HE WOULD GET AWAY WITH IT UNLESS WE COULD SOMEHOW [CHUCKLES] I GUESS PULL OFF A MIRACLE. CAROL, THIS GUY'S NEVER GONNA GET RICKY TO SAY ANYTHING, NOT WHILE HE HAS HIS GUARD UP. WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING? WE GO HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. NOT THIS AGAIN, HOWARD. WE CAN'T. HE WAS BEHAVING HIMSELF. WELL, WE KNEW NOTHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN WITH HIM IF HE'S BEING CAUTIOUS. HE HAS TO THINK THAT THE PRESSURE'S OFF. BUT SHE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE, HOWARD. IN THE COLD. THE IDEA WAS TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT WE WERE GIVING UP, THAT THERE WAS NO SOLUTION -- IN OTHER WORDS, HE'D GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT. CAROL... WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS. Carol: WE HAD NO CHOICE. WE WENT BACK FOR CHRISTMAS, AND... IT WAS VERY HARD TO LEAVE AND WONDERING STILL WHAT HAD HAPPENED. [ CHOIR SINGING "SILENT NIGHT" ] WE WENT OUT TO CHURCH THEN, AND WE SANG CHRISTMAS CAROLS. AND I'M THINKING, "HERE I AM IN CHURCH SINGING CHRISTMAS CAROLS, AND MY LIFE IS RUINED," YOU KNOW? IT WAS A VERY HARD TIME. ?? I DO REMEMBER A FEW THINGS I BOUGHT HER. I HAD THOSE GIFTS WRAPPED FOR HER, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT THROUGH THAT. I HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW HOW I GOT THROUGH WITHOUT GOING NUTS, AND I WAS CLOSE TO IT, PROBABLY. Howard: AT LEAST WHEN WE WERE IN ONEONTA, I FELT THAT I WAS AT LEAST THERE -- NOT THAT I WAS DOING ANYTHING OR HELPING, BUT AT LEAST I WAS PRESENT. NOW I'M 150 MILES AWAY AND DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING AND CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO BE HELPFUL. Narrator: HOWARD HAS NO IDEA THAT HIS PLAN TO LIE LOW IS ABOUT TO PAY OFF. OKAY, JOE, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT? Tighe: THIS IS THE CULMINATION. SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE FINAL LAP OF A RACE, YOU KNOW? [ CHUCKLES ] YOU WIN OR YOU LOSE. TURNS OUT ARTHUR HITT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR SOMETHING AFTER ALL. ?? Carol: THREE WEEKS IS A LONG TIME. AND IT'S AN AWFUL LONG TIME NOT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. IT HAD TO BE DONE. IT HAD TO BE FIGURED OUT SOMEHOW, BECAUSE NOT KNOWING WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE HELL IN OUR BOOK. ?? Tighe: I GOT A CALL ON NEW YEAR'S EVE. THERE HAD BEEN A BREAK IN THE CASE. OKAY, JOE, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT? GET READY FOR THIS. HE SAYS RICKY DID IT. HE CONFESSED TO THE WHOLE THING. WE WERE INFORMED THAT RICKY KNAPP HAD TOLD ARTHUR HITT THAT HE HAD KILLED HER AND THAT RICKY KNAPP HAD LINDA'S BODY AT SOMEPLACE OVER IN THE MOUNTAINS IN DELAWARE COUNTY. HE PUT IT IN A LIGHTLY WOODED AREA AND COVERED IT WITH SNOW AND LEFT IT THERE. DO HER PARENTS KNOW? NOT YET. ARTHUR HAD EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT WELL-HIDDEN. THEY'RE GONNA FIND IT. SO, THEN HE SAYS, "BUT I CAN DIG YOU A GRAVE, AND THEY'LL NEVER FIND IT." AND SO, THEY WERE GONNA MOVE THE BODY AND PUT IT IN A GRAVE THAT ARTHUR DUG WITH HIS BULLDOZER UP ON THE LOG SITE ON WINNEY HILL ROAD. ARTHUR CONVINCED HIM TO MOVE THE BODY. WHEN? TONIGHT AFTER DARK. OKAY, THIS IS OUR LAST CHANCE TO GET HIM. NOTHING CAN GO WRONG. I WANT TO BE IN PLACE BEFORE SUNSET. ?? [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] [ WIND BLOWING ] ANOTHER INVESTIGATOR AND I WENT UP. IT WAS EERIE 'CAUSE IT WAS REAL QUIET UP THERE. [ BIRDS CHIRPING, SQUAWKING ] WE'RE BACK IN THE WOODS. AND WE JUST WAITED THERE, AND IT FELT LIKE IT WAS CUTTING RIGHT TO THE BONE. YOU KNOW, IT WAS SO COLD. [ OWL HOOTS ] ?? RICKY PULLS IN THE LOT. WE WERE AFRAID HE WAS GONNA HIT US WITH THE LIGHTS. BUT THEN HE TURNED AND STOPPED, AND THEY GOT OUT OF THE CAR. AND THEY OPENED THE TRUNK. HEY. [ CHUCKLES ] ALL RIGHT, YOU GET HER LEGS. NO WAY. SO, THEN RICKY TRIES GETTING HER OUT OF THE TRUNK. [ GRUNTING ] HE FINALLY GOT HER OUT. OHH! [ THUD ] DROPPED HER OUT ON THE GROUND. A BIG THUD. YOU COULD HEAR THIS ECHO 'CAUSE SHE WAS FROZEN STIFF, YOU KNOW. [ LAUGHING ] YEAH. OH, THAT'S GONNA HURT, GIRL. [ LAUGHING ] HE WAS LAUGHING AND MAKING OBSCENE REMARKS ABOUT IT. ?? ?? [ RICKY GRUNTING ] HERE HE IS CARRYING A BODY, AND JOE MOORE WALKS UP. AND OF COURSE JOE'S A BIG GUY, YOU KNOW, AND TAPS HIM ON THE SHOULDER. BUT HE -- HE DEFINITELY WAS SURPRISED. [ HANDCUFFS CLICK, JANGLE ] ?? Tighe: THAT'S LINDA'S BODY WRAPPED IN A...SHEET OR... SORT OF LOOKS LIKE A SHEET. YOU CAN SEE HER BLUE JEANS ON THE LEG THERE. WOW. IF THIS BODY WAS IN THE WOODS AND IF YOU DIDN'T NOTICE THE BLUE JEANS, YOU COULD WALK RIGHT BY IT AND NOT NOTICE IT. LOOK LIKE A PILE OF SNOW. THAT'S ABOUT THE EPITOME OF CRIMES. THEY DON'T GET MUCH WORSE THAN THAT. ?? [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] HELLO. HOWARD VELZY. ?? ARE YOU SURE? ARE -- ARE YOU POSITIVE? OH, GOD. HOWARD, WHAT IS IT? IT'S LINDA. [ TELEPHONE THUDS LIGHTLY ] NO. NO, IT'S NOT TRUE. IT-- IT-- IT'S NOT TRUE. [ SOBS ] [ SOBBING ] ?? ?? ?? IT WAS JUST COMPLETE DEVASTATION THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO HAVE HER AROUND ANYMORE... AND WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH. [ CAR DOOR CLOSES ] [ SIGHS ] THANK YOU SO MUCH. I WOULD THINK SHE WAS PROBABLY SCARED TO DEATH, AND RIGHTLY SO. ?? ?? GENERALLY, WHEN WE DO GET TOGETHER, WE DON'T REALLY GO -- YOU KNOW, WE DON'T REALLY TALK MUCH ABOUT LINDA BECAUSE IT'S SO PAINFUL. WHEREAS, YOU KNOW, NOW WE HAVE A VENUE TO TALK TO YOU GUYS, AND SO... IT'S NOT AS HURTFUL. IT'S NOT AS PAI-- THERE'S NOT AS MUCH PAIN THERE. IT'S RUBBING A RAW NERVE. YOU KNOW, SHE WAS THE ONE SISTER THAT I HAD, AND I COULD TALK TO HER ABOUT ANYTHING. Carol: AH, FOR A LONG TIME, ONE OF THE WORST THINGS TO DO WAS TO WAKE UP. AND IT WOULD HIT ME WITH -- AND YOU JUST -- I JUST WOULD FEEL... AGONIZED. NOW, THIS WAS NOT A DREAM. THIS WAS FOR REAL. IT WAS JUST, HOW COULD WE EVER GET THROUGH THIS? Narrator: IN A TYPED CONFESSION, RICKY KNAPP REVEALS WHAT HAPPENED THE NIGHT HE MURDERED LINDA VELZY. Tighe: HE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TO THE BLACK CAT BAR. THEN HE LEFT, AND HE WAS GOING UP WEST STREET, I THINK, AND SAW THIS GIRL HITCH-HIKING, SO HE STOPPED AND PICKED HER UP. ?? THANK YOU SO MUCH. [ SIGHS ] I WAS NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT HIKE IN THE COLD. [ CHUCKLES ] AS YOU PROCEED UP WEST STREET TOWARDS THE CAMPUS, IF YOU DON'T TURN -- MAKE A RIGHT TURN INTO THE CAMPUS AND PROCEED ON UP WEST STREET, IT'S VERY RURAL. A LOT OF A WOODED AREA AND THAT. AND SO, IF SOMEONE WAS IN A CAR AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TO CAMPUS AND THE CAR GOES BY, THEY'RE GONNA GET VERY NERVOUS. ?? HEY, YOU -- YOU MISSED THE TURN. ?? PIECING TOGETHER KNAPP'S STATEMENT AND WHAT WE CAN ASCERTAIN, IT LOOKS LIKE THAT LINDA MUST HAVE PANICKED AND OPENED THE DOOR AND -- AND TRIED TO JUMP FROM THE CAR. [ TIRES SCREECH ] AND THEN RICKY GOT OUT OF THE CAR. HE PUNCHED HER IN THE THROAT AND KILLED HER. LINDA PROBABLY WAS DEAD WITHIN FIVE, TEN MINUTES AT THE MOST FROM THE TIME SHE WAS PICKED UP TILL THE TIME SHE WAS DECEASED -- MURDERED. WE RELIVE HOW HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HER AND WHAT SHE MUST HAVE GONE THROUGH. THAT WAS THE HARD PART, IS KNOWING WHAT SHE HAD TO FACE BEFORE HE KILLED HER. ?? [ SOBS SOFTLY ] ?? THAT WAS HARD. ?? AH, YES. THIS IS A CLASSIC. THERE'S A CAT. IT WAS MITTENS. AND THIS WAS HER FAVORITE. AND MITTENS FAVORED LINDA. AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY. DURING THE PERIOD BEFORE THE FUNERAL, WE RECEIVED PEOPLE AT OUR HOME RATHER THAN THROUGH THE FUNERAL HOME. UM... AND WE HAD THIS PICTURE ON AN END TABLE AT THE END OF THE LIVING ROOM. SHE WAS TRULY A GIFT. I'VE KNOWN HER SINCE THE FIFTH GRADE. THE PERSON WOULD COME IN THE ROOM. THAT CAT WOULD -- WHEREVER SHE WAS, WOULD GET UP, WALK OVER TO THE TABLE, SIT DOWN, AND WOULDN'T MOVE UNTIL THE LAST PERSON LEFT, DAY AFTER DAY. STRANGE. [ TALKING INDISTINCTLY ] I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. IT WAS... IT WAS AS IF SHE WAS SAYING... "THIS IS MY LINDA." [ PICTURE RUSTLES ] ?? ?? THIS IS HIM? HOLY COW. AGE DIDN'T DO MUCH FOR HIM. HE WAS JUST SICK. HE WAS, UH... JUST A SICK MAN, YOU KNOW. AND...HE DIDN'T DRAW ATTENTION TO HIMSELF, BUT IF YOU LOOKED AT HIS EYES, THEY'RE -- I CALL THEM EVIL EYES. CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN SEE. AND HE HAD IT. THEY SENT US A NOTICE, AND IT WAS A FORMAL LETTER INDICATING THAT HE HAD DIED IN PRISON. THEY TALK ABOUT CLOSURE IN A CASE LIKE THIS, AND... ...I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE CLOSURE. I'M NOT EVEN SURE YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE CLOSURE. Carol: WE'D BE WALKING AROUND, AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, I'D SEE SOMEONE WITH BLOND HAIR FROM THE BACK. ?? Howard: PART OF MY LIFE WAS DESTROYED. SHE LIVED A FULL LIFE, AS LONG AS IT LASTED. JUST A NORMAL TEENAGE, HEALTHY GIRL THAT WAS JUST INTERESTED IN LIFE -- EXPERIENCE AS MUCH IN LIFE AS SHE COULD. AND SHE DID. OH, YEAH. IT'S IN BEHIND OUR LOCAL CHURCH.
