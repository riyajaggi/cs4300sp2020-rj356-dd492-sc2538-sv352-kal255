 HINDSIGHT BEING 20/20, MAYBE HE'D STILL BE AROUND, BUT... THERE'S A BOND THAT YOU HOLD BETWEEN BROTHERS. I SAID, "DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?" HE SAID, "NO. WHAT?" I SAID, "THAT'S AN 'I GOTCHA.'" [ OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS, BIRDS SQUAWKING ] [ CHURCH BELL CLANGING, DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE ] Gray: OKAY. OPEN YOUR EYES! [ GIGGLES ] OOH, IT'S MY FAVORITE FLAVOR, TOO!

 BUT, DAD, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY. CAN'T YOU AT LEAST WALK ME TO THE BUS STOP? THE WEATHER IN THIS PARTICULAR YEAR, THE DECEMBER WAS UNUSUALLY COLD, AND WHEN WE WOKE UP ON THE 20th, THE TEMPERATURE WAS ZERO DEGREES. [ BLOWS ] BUT WHEN YOUR LITTLE GIRL SMILES AT YOU ON HER BIRTHDAY AND SAYS, YOU KNOW, "PLEASE WALK OUT WITH ME," YOU DO IT. [ LAUGHS ] ONLY SIX MORE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS. FIVE -- IF YOU DON'T COUNT TODAY. I REALLY HOPE I GET A BIKE. THAT'S AN AWFUL LOT TO ASK FOR. DON'T YOU THINK? AS WE WENT OUT THE DOOR, WE KIND OF CUT ACROSS OUR DRIVEWAY, WENT PAST THE CORNER OF THE CHURCH. ♪♪ DAD. SHE HALTED AND KIND OF, LIKE, WENT INTO A FROZEN POSITION. AND THERE SEEMED TO BE A BODY OR SOMETHING LAYING IN A SNOWBANK. HONEY, WAIT HERE. ♪♪ SIR? ♪♪ HEY. I SAW THAT THERE WAS BLOODSTAINED IN HIS GROIN AREA, AND THAT ALERTED ME TO SOMETHING BEING DRASTICALLY WRONG. ♪♪ OH, GOD. HONEY, COME WITH ME. TODAY'S DATE -- 12/20/89,  IN THE TOWN OF SOUTHINGTON. EXACT ADDRESS IS 594  WEST CENTER STREET EXTENSION. Saucier: THERE HAD BEEN A DUSTING DURING THE NIGHT, AND WHEN WE GOT THERE, IT WAS VERY COLD. SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL? YOU GET A NAME? DIDN'T HAVE I.D. ON HIM. WHAT ABOUT THE PERSON THAT FOUND HIM? ANY CONNECTION? NONE -- SAID HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM. [ SIGHS ] OKAY. WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THE BODY WAS THERE BECAUSE WHEN THE TEMPERATURE'S THAT COLD, RIGOR MORTIS WILL KICK IN SOONER. AND HE WAS STIFF -- NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. ♪♪ THIS ISN'T WHERE THE MURDER HAPPENED. WHY'D THEY BRING HIM HERE? ANYBODY'S GUESS. Skinner: THERE WAS NO SIGN OF A STRUGGLE WHATSOEVER. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE VICTIM HAD BEEN KILLED SOMEWHERE ELSE AND JUST DUMPED THERE. Saucier: HE'S GOT SOME BLOOD COMING OUT NEAR THE LEFT EYEBROW AREA, AND I NOTICE THAT THERE'S A GLOVE ON TOP OF THE BODY. AND THE GLOVE IS BLOODSTAINED. ♪♪ HEY, YOU SEE THIS? TAKE A LOT OF PRESSURE TO MAKE THOSE LIGATURE MARKS LIKE THAT. YOU THINK HE WAS STRANGLED. HEY, WAIT A SECOND. I THINK I KNOW THIS GUY. YEAH? Saucier: WE HAD A DETECTIVE TELLING US THAT HE WAS A BOUNCER AND PART-TIME BARTENDER AT BANQUER'S, WHICH WAS A NICE, CLASSY RESTAURANT, AND HIS NAME WAS ROBBIE SCHMIDT. Narrator: DETECTIVES TRACK DOWN ROBERT'S EMPLOYER... [ STATIC HISSES ] ...FOR MORE INFORMATION. Saucier: THE OWNER OF THE BAR WAS JEFFREY STENNER, A CLOSE FRIEND AND MENTOR TO ROBBIE SCHMIDT. SO HE WAS INVITED TO COME DOWN TO THE MORGUE. THANK YOU FOR COMING IN ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT POSITION TO BE IN, BUT WE NEED SOMEONE TO IDENTIFY THE BODY. COULD YOU HELP US OUT? UH, YEAH. YEAH, SURE. W- WHATEVER YOU NEED. MM. ♪♪ ♪♪ THE CORONER REMOVES THE COVERING ON THE BODY AND SHOWS THE FACE. ♪♪ AND JEFF STENNER LOOKS AT IT, AND YOU COULD SEE HE'S A BIT EMOTIONAL. THANK YOU. HIS FRIEND HAD BEEN MURDERED. HE WANTED TO DO ANYTHING HE COULD DO TO ASSIST WITH THE INVESTIGATION. NOW, YOU SAID YOU -- YOU SAW ROBBIE LAST NIGHT. YEAH. UM, WE WERE AT BANQUER'S. Saucier: JEFF STENNER HAD TOLD ME THAT WHEN ROBBIE LEFT AT 10:00, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET UP AGAIN LATER ON THAT NIGHT. JEFF SAID ROBBIE NEVER SHOWED UP. CAN YOU THINK OF ANYONE WHO MIGHT WANT HIM DEAD, ANYTHING HE WAS INVOLVED IN? NO. NO. HE WAS A GOOD KID. EVERYBODY LOVED HIM. HAVE YOU TOLD HIS FAMILY YET? NO. THAT'S OUR NEXT STOP. HE WAS REALLY CLOSE WITH HIS SISTER. I'VE KNOWN HER A LONG TIME. OH, GOD. SHE'S GONNA BE... WOULD YOU MIND TAKING US OVER THERE TO TELL HER THE NEWS? IT ALWAYS HELPS WHEN IT'S SOMEONE YOU KNOW. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] YEAH, SURE. WHATEVER YOU NEED. ♪♪ [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] IT'S OPEN! [ DOOR OPENS ] I'D BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM ALL DAY. I JUST KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG. JEFF SHOWED UP AT MY HOUSE AND TOLD ME THAT HE HAD JUST WENT DOWN TO I.D. ROBERT'S BODY. Stenner: I'M SO SORRY, LAURA. I... [ SOBBING, SNIFFLES ] TWO DETECTIVES FROM SOUTHINGTON SHOWED UP TO TELL ME THAT IT WAS TRUE. ♪♪ AND I PUNCHED THE CABINET -- CORNER OF MY KITCHEN. [ SOBBING CONTINUES ] ♪♪ [ Voice breaking ] THAT'S THE PERSON HE WAS. LOOK AT HIM. HE'S PLAYING WITH THESE KIDS. HE WAS A KIND PERSON. [ SNIFFLES ] HE'S NOT HURTING ANYBODY. HE'S PLAYING WITH THESE KIDS. ♪♪ FAMILY, KIDS, WIFE -- ROBERT WANTED TO HAVE JUST, [Chuckling] YOU KNOW, THE AMERICAN DREAM, LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE -- WHITE PICKET FENCE, HANGING OUT WITH MY FRIENDS ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON, CHILLING OUT WITH MY NIECES AND NEPHEWS, SEEING MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS, SPENDING TIME WITH MY DAD. I MEAN, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER WIDE-EYED 26-YEAR-OLD... HOPING FOR THE BEST. ♪♪ WHEN YOU'RE INVESTIGATING SOMETHING LIKE THIS, YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU. THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM WAS YESTERDAY. Heslin: HOW CAN IT BE POSSIBLE? IT'S CHRISTMAS. ROBERT'S GONNA BE THERE. WE'RE GONNA GO TO MOM AND DAD'S AS A FAMILY. WE'RE GONNA BE TOGETHER -- THAT SAME, USUAL ROUTINE. YOU KNOW... IT'S WHAT WE ALWAYS DO. HE, UM, LEFT FOR WORK, LIKE USUAL. [ SMACKS LIPS, INHALES DEEPLY ] HIS TRUCK WAS BROKEN DOWN, SO HE HAD TO TAKE MY CAR. Heslin: HE SAID HE COULDN'T BRING THE CAR BACK BECAUSE HE HAD TO RUN AN ERRAND AND HE HAD TO GO TO NEW HAVEN. AND I SAID, "WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO TO NEW HAVEN?" AND I BLEW UP AT HIM AND SAID, "I WANT MY CAR BACK NOW." HE NEVER CAME BACK. AND I CAN'T FORGIVE MYSELF FOR YELLING AT HIM. ♪♪ SORRY. [ SIGHS ] IT'S OKAY. I- I KNOW IT'S VERY HARD. [ SNIFFLES ] DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE WAS GOING ON THIS ERRAND? NO. [ SNIFFLES ] WAS YOUR BROTHER ACTING... STRANGELY -- OUT OF THE ORDINARY? ACTUALLY, YES. LATELY, HE HAD JUST BEEN ACTING REALLY NERVOUS. THEN, A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, I WAS CLEANING IN HIS ROOM, AND I FOUND... A GUN. I MEAN, HE SEEMED SCARED, LIKE SOMEBODY WAS COMING TO GET HIM. Heslin: I KNEW THAT HE WAS IN TROUBLE BECAUSE HE HAD THE GUN ON HIS BED. I KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. ♪♪ [ WIND WHISTLES ] ONE MINUTE, WE'RE GETTING READY TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS TOGETHER, AND THE NEXT MINUTE, WE'RE PLANNING ROBERT'S FUNERAL. ♪♪ IT WAS LIKE... THE TREES WERE UP, THE LIGHTS WERE ON, BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. ♪♪ Skinner: WHEN LAURA WOKE UP IN THE MORNING, SHE GOT A CALL FROM JEFFREY STENNER, WHO SAID THAT HER CAR WAS PARKED BEHIND BANQUER'S. Saucier: THIS IS THE CAR THAT THE VICTIM HAD BORROWED FROM HIS SISTER FOR THE NIGHT AND HAD BROUGHT IT TO BANQUER'S RESTAURANT IN NEW BRITAIN. I ASKED PERMISSION TO SEARCH THE CAR THAT WAS LEFT IN THE PARKING LOT. SHE GAVE ME THE PERMISSION. WE GOT TO BANQUER'S -- CAR'S UNLOCKED, KEYS AREN'T IN IT. ♪♪ LAURA SAID THAT THAT WAS VERY, VERY STRANGE BECAUSE HER BROTHER WOULD NEVER DO THAT. HE'D NEVER LEAVE IT UNLOCKED. I'M GONNA TAKE A LOOK AT THE TRUNK. ♪♪ Saucier: WE OPEN UP THE TRUNK, AND THERE'S CLOTHESLINE ROPE IN THE TRUNK. IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME DIAMETER OR CIRCUMFERENCE AS THE FURROWS IN THE NECK WHEN BEING STRANGLED, SO THIS IS SUSPICIOUS. LET'S HAVE ANOTHER LOOK IN THE CAR. AND I'M LOOKING, AND UNDER THE FRONT SEAT, I SEE A PAPER TAG. ♪♪ AND I RECOGNIZE THE TAG AS A BOSS GLOVE TAG, WHICH IS THE IDENTICAL TO THE GLOVE THAT'S ON TOP OF THE DEAD BODY. YOU KNOW HOW TALL THE VICTIM WAS? Skinner: COULDN'T BE LESS THAN 6 FEET. NOW, I'M SAYING TO MYSELF, "HE WAS MURDERED HERE." HE WASN'T DRIVING THIS CAR. I WANTED THAT CAR PROCESSED FOR EVIDENCE. ♪♪ Narrator: THE CONNECTICUT STATE POLICE MAJOR CRIME SQUAD FINDS 13 FINGERPRINTS IN THE CAR. ♪♪ 13 PRINTS. NOW ALL WE NEED IS A SUSPECT. Saucier: IN MY DAY, WHEN THIS HOMICIDE OCCURRED, WE DIDN'T AN AUTOMATED FINGER-IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM, AS THEY DO TODAY. THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT THAT THIS ONE FINGERPRINT BELONGS TO "A PERSON" IS TO HAVE THAT "A PERSON" AS A SUSPECT AND COMPARE THEIR PRINTS TO THAT. GOT THE AUTOPSY REPORT BACK ON THE SCHMIDT CASE. NO SURPRISE HERE. CAUSE OF DEATH -- STRANGULATION. THERE'S SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL ABOUT THOSE LIGATURE MARKS, THOUGH. HOW SO? ALL RIGHT, WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, THE LIGATURE MARKS ARE ONLY SHOWING UP ON THE FRONT OF THE THROAT -- NONE ON THE BACK. NORMALLY, IF YOU WERE TO TIGHTEN A ROPE AROUND SOMEBODY'S NECK, YOU WOULD EXPECT MARKS ALL THE WAY AROUND. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS HE WAS KILLED IN THE FRONT SEAT. STRANGLED FROM BEHIND. HEADREST WOULD HAVE BLOCKED THE ROPE IN THE BACK. ♪♪ THAT SOUNDS PLAUSIBLE TO ME. SO, WE HAVE ROBBIE SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT, KILLER SITTING BEHIND HIM, AND SOMEONE ELSE SITTING IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. [ SIGHS ] THANKS. HAVE A MERRY CHRISTMAS. MM. I SUSPECTED THAT THERE HAD TO HAVE BEEN AT LEAST TWO PERPETRATORS, IF NOT MORE, IN THE CAR TO DO THIS. ♪♪ EXCUSE ME, SIR. WE'RE WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. I'M DETECTIVE SAUCIER. THIS IS MY PARTNER, DETECTIVE SKINNER. I FOUND OUT WHO WAS AT THE BANQUER'S ON THE 19th, AND I HAD A TON OF NAMES. ONE OF THEM WAS A STOCKBROKER. UH, WE HEARD THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE KNOWN ROBBIE SCHMIDT. [ SIGHS ] UH, YEAH. YEAH, I KNEW ROBBIE. HE WAS A GOOD KID. Saucier: HE SAID, "THE AFTERNOON BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED, I WAS AT THE BAR HAVING MY DRINK, AND I NOTICED THAT HE WAS IN THE PARKING LOT WITH JEFF STENNER AND TWO BODYBUILDERS, AND THERE WAS A PICKUP TRUCK ON THE ROAD, AND THEY PUSHED IT INTO THE PARKING LOT." WHO WERE THE OTHER TWO GUYS? I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THEM. I DON'T KNOW. BUT THEY WERE BIG GUYS -- KIND OF BODYBUILDER TYPE. THAT'S -- THAT'S ALL I REMEMBER. I NEEDED TO FIND OUT WHO THE TWO BODYBUILDERS WERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. SURE. YEAH. ANYTIME. Saucier: THESE TWO GUYS SAW ROBBIE THE NIGHT PRIOR TO HIS DEATH, SO I WANTED TO KNOW WHO THEY WERE, AND I WANTED TO INTERVIEW THEM. ♪♪ SO, I STARTED INTERVIEWING PEOPLE AT THE GYM IN NEW BRITAIN. THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY SCOTT CANCEL AND JOHN GRZESZCZYK. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SCOTT CANCEL AND JOHN GRZESZCZYK. LOOKS LIKE YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. HOW CAN WE HELP YOU? WE'RE INVESTIGATING A HOMICIDE. A HOMICIDE? WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH US? WE'RE NOT SURE. I ASKED THEM ABOUT THE NIGHT OF THE 19th. WE UNDERSTAND YOU WERE AT BANQUER'S RESTAURANT ON TUESDAY HELPING SOMEONE MOVE A TRUCK, RIGHT? YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH, THE -- YOU REMEMBER THAT? YEAH, THE GUY THAT SAID THAT, UH -- THAT HIS ENGINE STOPPED WORKING AND HE NEEDED HELP MOVING IT. YEAH, THE SNOW -- IT WAS, UH -- IT WAS COMING DOWN HARD, SO, UH, WE TRIED TO HELP HIM MOVE THE TRUCK OFF THE ROAD. IS THIS THE MAN THAT YOU HELPED? YEAH. THAT'S HIM, ALL RIGHT. MY PARTNER'S GONNA TAKE YOUR CONTACT INFO, IF YOU DON'T MIND. Saucier: THEY WERE THERE THE DAY OF THE MURDER. IN AND OF ITSELF, IT MEANS NOTHING, BUT IT TIES FOUR PEOPLE AT ONE LOCATION AT A PARTICULAR TIME. SO, I LEAVE TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY FINGERPRINTS ON FILE. GRZESZCZYK HAD NO RECORD AT ALL, HAD NO FINGERPRINTS ON FILE. CANCEL DID. SCOTT CANCEL HAD A CRIMINAL HISTORY -- DEALT IN DRUGS, DEALT IN A LOT OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. AND I'M SAYING TO MYSELF, "IF SOMEONE HIRED SOMEONE TO DO THIS MURDER, THIS MIGHT BE THE GUY THAT THEY WOULD HIRE." ♪♪ SO I SUBMITTED CANCEL'S FINGERPRINTS TO BE COMPARED WITH THE 13 FINGERPRINTS I GOT OFF THE CAR. BUT THE FINGERPRINTS WEREN'T HIS. AND THAT REACHED A DEAD END AT THAT TIME. ♪♪ Narrator: ONE WEEK AFTER ROBERT SCHMIDT'S MURDER, HIS FAMILY HOLDS HIS FUNERAL. MY FATHER... [Crying] I WATCHED MY FATHER CRUMBLE. ♪♪ I WATCHED HIM AT THE WEAKEST MOMENT IN HIS LIFE. ♪♪ NO PARENT SHOULD OUTLIVE THEIR CHILD. NOT FOR THAT. IT'S NOT FAIR. DISEASE -- ONE THING. MURDER -- NO. ♪♪ THANK YOU FOR COMING, DETECTIVE. IT MEANS A LOT. YEAH. LISTEN, UH... [SIGHS] I KNOW IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR YOU BOTH. Saucier: I WENT TO THE FUNERAL PARLOR WHEN THEY WERE HAVING THE WAKE. I PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE FAMILY, AND I'M WATCHING PEOPLE. I SEE JEFF STENNER COME IN, AND HE COMES IN WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I SEE JEFF WHISPER SOMETHING TO THE GIRLFRIEND, AND SHE LOOKS DIRECTLY AT ME. ♪♪ AND SHE, LIKE, ALMOST PANICS. AND NOW SHE CAN'T LOOK AT ME. AN INNOCENT PERSON WHO HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG DOESN'T ACT LIKE THAT WHEN THEY SEE A POLICE OFFICER. I SAID TO MYSELF, "SHE'S PART OF THIS." I SAID, "SHE'S PART OF THIS INVESTIGATION." ♪♪ ♪♪ [ SIGHS ] THAT'S MY OLDEST BROTHER, RODNEY, IN THE MIDDLE THERE, WEARING HIS, UH... MILITARY DRESS BLUES. ♪♪ SO, WE HAD TO WAIT FOR HIM TO FLY IN IN ORDER TO HAVE THE FUNERAL. SO... [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] MIGHT BE THE HARDEST PICTURE I EVER HAD TO LOOK AT. ♪♪ I CAN SEE THE DESPAIR IN MY FATHER'S FACE. ♪♪ I DIDN'T SEE THAT VERY OFTEN. ♪♪ NOT EASY TO LOOK AT. ♪♪ Narrator: SOUTHINGTON POLICE STILL HAVE NO LEADS IN THE MURDER OF ROBERT SCHMIDT. BUT HIS BROTHER JAY HAS BEEN KEEPING A SECRET. YOU CANNOT TELL ANYONE. OKAY. I PROMISE. Schmidt: THE LAST NIGHT I SAW HIM, MY BROTHER ROBERT HAD CONFIDED IN ME THAT HE HAD ROBBED A ARMORED CAR. WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?! CLEARLY, I WASN'T THINKING. BUT NOW I MADE A MISTAKE, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. [ SIGHS HEAVILY ] ♪♪ WE HAVE TO TELL DAD. MNH-MNH. NO. YOU MADE A PROMISE, JAY. ALL RIGHT? WE ARE NOT TELLING ANYONE ABOUT THIS. I JUST -- I NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT, OKAY? HINDSIGHT BEING 20/20, MAYBE IF WE TOLD OUR DAD, YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE'D STILL BE AROUND. BUT... THERE'S A BOND THAT YOU HOLD BETWEEN BROTHERS. ♪♪ Saucier: NOT LONG AFTER THE MURDER, I WAS VISITED BY ROBBIE SCHMIDT'S FAMILY. ♪♪ Saucier: HEY, GUYS. I UNDERSTAND YOU WANTED TO TALK? FOLLOW ME. Schmidt: [ SIGHS ] WE HADN'T TOLD OUR DAD YET UNTIL AFTER WE GOT TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. WHAT'S GOING ON? LISTEN, I, UH... [ GULPS ] I THINK I MAY KNOW WHY... ROBBIE WAS KILLED. REALLY? ROBBIE TOLD ME THAT... HE WAS INVOLVED IN A, UM... ROBBERY SCHEME. R- ROBBERY? TO WATCH THE SHOCK ON HIS FACE... KIND OF HURTS. UM... BRINGS OUT SOME FEELINGS THAT YOU'D RATHER NOT. ♪♪ DID HE MENTION WHO ELSE WAS INVOLVED? ♪♪ JEFFREY STENNER. I DON'T KNOW IF DETECTIVE SAUCIER AT THE TIME KNEW EXACTLY WHAT JEFF AND ROBERT WERE INVOLVED IN, BUT I THINK HE HAD A PRETTY CLEAR PICTURE SHORTLY AFTER WE GOT INTO THE POLICE STATION. STENNER? THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT WAS THE GENTLEMAN THAT WOULD HAVE DONE THIS -- IN SOME WAY. JAY. I NEED YOU TO COME WITH ME TO SIT FOR A FURTHER STATEMENT. ♪♪ Saucier: I STARTED WORKING WITH OTHER AGENCIES. THE FBI CONFIRMED THAT ARMORED CAR ROBBERIES DID OCCUR. I SAID, "REALLY?" JEFF STENNER -- THIS WAS A GUY THAT THE VICTIM THOUGHT WAS HIS BEST FRIEND AND A MENTOR. THAT CHANGED MY WHOLE PERSPECTIVE OF HIM. IT'S ALL IN THERE. WE'VE HAD OUR EYES ON HIM FOR A WHILE. Heslin: ROBERT LOOKED UP TO JEFF A LOT. I THINK HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT HE COULDN'T FIND AT HOME OR ANYWHERE ELSE. ROBERT CARED A LOT ABOUT HIM -- WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HIM. SO, HOW'D THEY DO IT? OH, WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. WE THINK STENNER'S THE BRAINS BEHIND THE OPERATION. AND SCHMIDT -- HE WAS WORKING ON THE TRUCK WHEN IT GOT HIT. THAT WAS AN EASY ONE -- IN AND OUT. OVER A MILLION DOLLARS. Reporter:  AN ARMORED BANK VEHICLE  WAS HELD UP AT GUNPOINT... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...AND 10. MARKING IT DOWN. WHAT DOES THAT PUT US AT SO FAR? THAT PUTS US AT... [ CHUCKLES ] ...SO FAR? MM-HMM. $900,000. Skinner: OUR THEORY INITIALLY WAS THAT JEFFREY ORGANIZED THESE BECAUSE BANQUER'S WAS IN TROUBLE FINANCIALLY. KEEP COUNTING IT. I WILL. I WILL. MAKE SURE IT'S RIGHT. ROBERT SCHMIDT HAD WORKED AS A GUARD ON AN ARMORED CAR FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS, SO HE TALKS TO HIM, SAYS, "HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY? WE KNOCK OFF THE ARMORED CAR. WE GET THE MONEY." WRITE IT DOWN. WRITE IT DOWN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH ALL THIS MONEY. I DON'T KNOW, EITHER, BUT WE GOT ALL OF IT HERE. ABOUT A YEAR AGO, RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS, ANOTHER TRUCK GETS HIT. YEAH, THE GUARDS ARE BRINGING THE MONEY OUT OF THE BANK. OUT OF NOWHERE, A GUY SHOWS UP, PUTS A GUN IN THEIR FACE. THAT WAS STENNER. [ CHUCKLES ] WELL, THE CRAZY THING ABOUT THAT IS, NOBODY GOT A LOOK AT HIS FACE. HE WAS WEARING A SANTA OUTFIT -- BEARD AND EVERYTHING. 3/4 OF A MILLION ON THAT. THE ARMORED CAR WAS HELD UP ON DECEMBER 20, 1988-- A YEAR TO THE DAY PRIOR TO ROBBIE'S DEATH. ♪♪ [ SIGHS ] YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S TIME TO CELEBRATE. ♪♪ CAN YOU PROVE ALL OF THIS? NOT YET. MERRY CHRISTMAS. [ GLASSES CLINK ] AND THE NEXT ONE IS GONNA BE EVEN BIGGER. THE NEXT ONE? YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO WEASEL OUT OF THIS, ARE YOU, ROBBIE? [ SIGHS ] LOOK, NO, BUT -- BECAUSE LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU. WE'VE GOT A GOOD THING GOING HERE. AND WITHOUT YOU, IT DOESN'T WORK. SO JUST KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN AND TRY NOT TO MESS IT UP. OKAY? YEAH. YEAH, YEAH. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WOULD CALL IT "FORCED INTO LABOR" OR WHATEVER, BUT ROBERT PRETTY MUCH WAS AT JEFF'S BECK AND CALL UP UNTIL A CERTAIN POINT, WHERE HE STARTED TO FEEL UNSAFE AND NERVOUS AND SCARED, WORRIED. ♪♪ Saucier: I SUSPECTED THAT STENNER WAS GETTING A LITTLE NERVOUS THAT ROBBIE MIGHT TALK TO THE FEDS ABOUT THE ROBBERIES. THEIR ROBBERIES, I BELIEVE, WERE THE MOTIVE. I KNEW JEFF WAS INVOLVED AND I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH, SO YOU GOT TO SQUEEZE -- LACK OF OTHER WORDS -- PEOPLE THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THEM, HOPING TO FIND OUT THAT SOMEONE ENDS UP SAYING SOMETHING. JEFFREY HAD A GIRLFRIEND WHO HE MADE MANAGER OF BANQUER'S. AT THE FUNERAL, HER DEMEANOR REALLY KIND OF STUCK RIGHT OUT AT ME. SHE WAS EXTREMELY NERVOUS. AT NO TIME WOULD SHE MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH ME. THERE'S DEFINITELY A MENTAL NOTE THAT "WHY IS SHE SO NERVOUS ABOUT THIS? SHE KNOWS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T." ♪♪ Narrator: DETECTIVES DECIDE TO BRING IN JEFFREY STENNER'S GIRLFRIEND FOR AN INTERVIEW. [ RECORDER CLICKS ] Saucier: THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER, THE GIRLFRIEND TOLD ME THAT SHE GOT HOME AT 10:00, WENT TO BED, AND JEFF CAME IN TO BED AROUND 12:45, 1:00. JEFF WAS AT BANQUER'S ALL NIGHT. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE ARMORED CAR ROBBERIES? I NEED TO TALK TO MY LAWYER. MAYBE SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH. MAYBE SHE ISN'T. AND SHE LAWYERED UP ON ME AFTER A WHILE. STENNER REFUSED TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH, AND HE LAWYERED UP ON ME ALSO. ♪♪ Skinner: CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS -- CIRCUMSTANTIAL. CIRCUMSTANTIAL IS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE A CASE ON. YOU NEEDED HARD EVIDENCE TO CONNECT HIM -- TO CONNECT STENNER TO THIS CASE -- AND WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE IT AT THAT TIME. ♪♪ ♪♪ FREEZE! HANDS UP! HANDS UP! HANDS UP! JUST GET 'EM UP! WHAT IS THIS? YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS. GET DRESSED. THE EVIDENCE WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THEM TO ARREST JEFF STENNER FOR THE ROBBERY, BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FOR THE MURDER. IN HIS YEARBOOK -- A HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK -- HIS AMBITION IN THE FUTURE WAS TO COMMIT THE PERFECT CRIME. "TO COMMIT THE PERFECT CRIME." THAT WAS HIS AMBITION. I VIEW HIM AS BEING SOCIOPATHIC. I REALLY DO. I DON'T THINK HE HAS A CONSCIENCE. I DON'T THINK HE HAS GUILT ABOUT ANYTHING. WE GOT HIM FOR THE ARMORED CAR ROBBERY, SO HE COPPED A PLEA, HOPING THAT HE WAS GONNA GET FIVE YEARS. HE GOT 10, WHICH KIND OF KNOCKED THE WIND OUT OF HIM. Skinner: NO ONE WAS EVER ABLE TO REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE MONEY FROM THE ARMORED CARS. CERTAINLY, AFTER THE ARMORED CAR ROBBERIES WERE COMMITTED, JEFFREY'S GIRLFRIEND SAW THE MONEY, AND SHE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. AND SHE SERVED A YEAR IN PRISON. IT WAS BITTERSWEET FOR THE FAMILY TO KNOW THAT HE DID GET ARRESTED FOR SOMETHING, BUT IT'S, UH -- IT'S KIND OF EMPTY. Heslin: I NEVER THOUGHT THEY'D SOLVE IT. I FIGURED IT WAS COLD. NOBODY WAS LOOKING BECAUSE THEY ALL THOUGHT HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE ROBBERIES. I FIGURED IT WAS DONE WITH -- YOU KNOW, NOBODY CARED. ♪♪ IT JUST WAS EXASPERATING IF HE DIDN'T GO TO JAIL FOR THE RIGHT THINGS RIGHT NOW. HE NEEDED TO GO TO JAIL FOR KILLING ROBERT. Saucier: I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED -- VERY FRUSTRATING. I FELT THAT AT THAT TIME, THE CASE WAS PROBABLY AT A DEAD END. BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT MADE THINGS OKAY. THERE'S NO STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON MURDER. ♪♪ [ BIRDS CHIRPING, DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE ] Schmidt: I'M A FIRM BELIEVER IN KARMA, AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY YOUR PENANCE IN THE END. SO, IN SOME WAY, SOMEHOW, THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO LEAK OUT AND COME TO THE SURFACE EVENTUALLY. AND I DON'T CARE IF IT WAS 50 YEARS. Heslin: I JUST FIGURED ONCE THEY SETTLED THIS ARMORED CAR ROBBERY, THEY'RE NOT GONNA KEEP GOING, AND THAT KIND OF... TICKED ME OFF. ♪♪ I WANTED THEM TO GET JUSTICE FOR ROBERT, JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER PERSON WHO'S BEEN TAKEN TOO EARLY. Narrator: IT'S BEEN NINE YEARS SINCE JEFFREY STENNER'S ARREST FOR ARMED ROBBERY. HE IS SET TO BE RELEASED FROM PRISON SOON, AND STILL, NOBODY HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH ROBERT SCHMIDT'S MURDER. ♪♪ Saucier: AS THE YEARS STARTED GOING BY, IT GOES ON THE BACK BURNER BECAUSE YOU'RE AT A DEAD END. BUT IT'S NOT FORGOTTEN. IT'S NEVER FORGOTTEN. ♪♪ WHAT'S THAT? THE ROBBIE SCHMIDT CASE. IT'S BEEN BUGGING ME. AT A MINIMUM, $800,000 IS STILL MISSING FROM THE ARMORED CARS. LET ME SEE THAT. AT THE TIME, WE REALLY WEREN'T THAT INTERESTED IN WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE MONEY. WE WERE INTERESTED IN SOLVING THE MURDER. ♪♪ WE DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT FOR JEFFREY TO GET RELEASED. IF HE DID GET RELEASED, WE KNEW THAT THAT MUCH MONEY, HE COULD DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR AND WE WOULD NEVER FIND HIM. WE WERE HITTING DEAD ENDS. ♪♪ ♪♪ WHAT IF HE WASN'T IN THE CAR? WHAT? WE FOUND THE CAR BEHIND BANQUER'S RESTAURANT. WHY WOULD STENNER LEAVE IT THERE? HE'S TOO SMART FOR THAT. THAT'S A GOOD POINT. STENNER WASN'T IN THE CAR -- HIRED SOMEONE TO DO IT FOR HIM. ♪♪ LET'S RUN THESE PRINTS AGAIN. YEAH. MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY. YEAH. MARSHA? CAN YOU TAKE THESE DOWN TO THE LAB? TELL THEM TO RUN THEM RIGHT AWAY. ♪♪ WE HAD NO IDEA AT THAT TIME WHO THAT COULD BE. AND THEN THE PHONE RINGS. [ SIGHS ] [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] SKINNER. AND IT'S THE FORENSIC FINGERPRINT EXAMINER, WHO SAYS, "I GOT A HIT ON THE LATENT PRINT ON THE REARVIEW MIRROR OF THE CAR." JOHN GRZESZCZYK. ♪♪ THANKS. [ RECEIVER CLACKS ] JOHN GRZESZCZYK. FROM THE GYM IN NEW BRITAIN. GRZESZCZYK WAS WITH SCHMIDT THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER, PUSHING THE PICKUP TRUCK. THAT WAS THE CONNECTION. Skinner: GRZESZCZYK HAD BEEN INTERVIEWED ONCE, ALONG WITH ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL BY THE NAME OF SCOTT CANCEL. WHY DIDN'T THIS TURN UP THE FIRST TIME WE RAN HIS PRINTS? WE DIDN'T HAVE HIS PRINTS ON FILE. NOW WE DO. THE OWNER OF THE FINGERPRINT, JOHN GRZESZCZYK, HAD NEVER BEEN ARRESTED AND HAD NEVER BEEN FINGERPRINTED. AFTER THE MURDER, JOHN GRZESZCZYK APPLIED FOR A PISTOL PERMIT AND, AS SUCH, HAD TO HAVE BEEN FINGERPRINTED. ♪♪ [ RECORDER CLICKS ] THANKS FOR COMING IN, JOHN. OF COURSE. I'M A LITTLE, UH, UNCLEAR AS TO WHY I'M HERE, THOUGH. RIGHT. HE HAD A DECENT JOB AT THE TIME. HE HAD A COUPLE CHILDREN. HE WAS RECENTLY DIVORCED. HE WAS LIVING WITH HIS PARENTS. WE COULDN'T COME UP WITH ANY PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION WHY HIS FINGERPRINT WOULD BE IN THIS CAR. WELL, WE WANTED TO CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT AN OLD CASE WE'RE BREAKING BACK INTO. SURE. WHAT ABOUT? ROBBIE SCHMIDT. YOU REMEMBER HIM? WE SPOKE WITH YOU A WHILE BACK WITH YOUR FRIEND SCOTT CANCEL. YOU DID? WHAT -- YOU DON'T REMEMBER? SURE DON'T. IF YOU HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH A HOMICIDE AND YOU'RE INTERVIEWED ABOUT IT, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER GONNA FORGET THAT YOU WERE INTERVIEWED ABOUT IT. WELL... [ SMACKS LIPS ] I THINK I GOT SOMETHING THAT'LL JOG YOUR MEMORY. ♪♪ LOOK FAMILIAR? [ CLEARS THROAT ] [ INHALES DEEPLY ] LIKE I SAID, NO. TAKE A CLOSE LOOK. DIDN'T MAKE ANY REMARKS ABOUT "HE LOOKS DEAD" OR "WHY IS HE LYING IN A SNOWBANK?" JUST DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF IT. ALL RIGHT. WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS? ♪♪ YOU EVER SEEN THAT CAR? WE THEN SHOWED HIM A PICTURE OF THE CAR. NO. WHAT WAS THAT? I SAID NO. [ CLEARS THROAT ] YOU SEE, I FIND THAT REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE, JOHN. WHAT IS THIS? THOSE ARE YOUR FINGERPRINTS, JOHN. AND THEY HAPPEN TO MATCH A SET OF PRINTS WE FOUND INSIDE ROBBIE SCHMIDT'S CAR. VERY QUICKLY, HE SAID, "THAT MUST BE A MISTAKE." SO I SAID, "WELL, JOHN, THEN EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOUR FINGERPRINT IS ON THE REARVIEW MIRROR." ♪♪ AND I WENT LIKE THAT WITH MY FINGER, AND I SAID, "JOHN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?" HE SAID, "NO, WHAT?" I SAID, "THAT'S AN 'I GOTCHA.'" [ SOBBING ] AND HE PUT HIS HEAD DOWN, AND HE STARTED TO TREMBLE. ♪♪ [ BIRD SQUAWKS ] Skinner: THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY I CAN HELP YOU, JOHN. YOU GOT TO TALK. [ GROANS ] I'M SCARED. OKAY? I'M SCARED OF SCOTT, MAN. HE'S -- HE'S CRAZY. [ BREATHING SHAKILY ] ALL RIGHT, M-- UH... UH, BASICALLY, IT, UH... Skinner: HE TOLD US THAT ONE DAY, SCOTT CANCEL SAID TO HIM AND GILBERTO DELGADO, "JEFFREY STENNER HAS A GUY WORKING FOR HIM THAT'S OUT OF LINE, AND HE NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT A LESSON." THIS IS GILBERTO. GILBERTO -- JOHN. NOW, I CALLED HIM OVER HERE 'CAUSE I GOT A JOB FOR THE TWO OF YOU TO DO, OKAY? IF YOU DO IT WELL, THERE'S GONNA BE SOME MONEY AT THE END OF IT. AND HE TOLD THEM HE WANTED THEM TO KILL HIM -- TO SHUT MR. SCHMIDT UP SO JEFFREY WOULDN'T GO TO PRISON FOR THE ARMORED CARS. CHEERS. [ CANS CLACK ] GRZESZCZYK TOLD US THAT THAT NIGHT, THEY HAD GONE TO BANQUER'S, AND THEY MET STENNER THERE, AND HE POINTED OUT SCHMIDT TO THEM. AND STENNER TOLD SCHMIDT THAT HE HAD SOMETHING HE NEEDED THEM TO DO IN NEW HAVEN. Stenner: I APPRECIATE YOU ALL DOING THIS FOR ME. ROBBIE'S GONNA TAKE YOU ALL TO NEW HAVEN. I'LL COVER GAS, EXPENSES -- WHATEVER YOU NEED. SOUNDS GOOD. I'LL HANG BACK WITH YOU, YEAH? YEAH, SURE. HEY, YOU MIND IF I DRIVE? ♪♪ [ SIGHS ] YEAH. GET IN. Skinner: HE SAID THEY REALLY HAD NO DEFINITE DIRECTION IN MIND, BUT HE DROVE THROUGH NEW BRITAIN OUT TOWARDS SOUTHINGTON.
