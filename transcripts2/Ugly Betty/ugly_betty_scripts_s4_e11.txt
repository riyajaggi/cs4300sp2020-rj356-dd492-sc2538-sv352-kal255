 Ugly Betty (2006â€“2010): Season 4, Episode 11 - Back in Her Place - full transcript 
 A battered but unbowed Betty recounts her worst week ever to Mr. Z as the show flashes back to her horrible last few days. Frustrated over the frivolous assignments Wilhemina gives her at Mode, and inspired by Audrey Hepburn's memoir, Betty creates her own blog about amazing charitable ventures that inspire her. However, as her hobby enriches her, her job is nearly killing her, since Wilhemina tortures Betty with beauty experiments for future stories. Meanwhile, Daniel fears Marc is sabotaging him -- and he is; Bobby treats a hormonal Hilda to some pampering during "Hilda Week," which goes awry, and Wilhelmina makes a long-term commitment to the incarcerated Connor.

 It's Betty. Can we talk? Hi. I'm doing crunches. You got the money or not? Yes. Well, no. Some. But... Look, I think if you let me explain, you'd be a lot more open to working this out. I've had an awful, awful week, and... Please, just hear me out. Fine. Move your face. I finished Audrey Hepburn's biography last night and it totally inspired me. Ugh. Audrey Hepburn, she's so boring.

 I hated Breakfast at Tiffany's. But if you tell one gay person I said that, - I will deny it. I will. - I promise. Anyway, Audrey basically gave up her stardom to go and do good in the world, and it made me think. I'm an editor now. Really? And I'm finally in a position to tell stories like that. Stories about people who do inspiring and selfless things. Well, here's your next assignment from the powers that be. Inspiring? "The most comfortable stiletto. " Betty Suarez, keeping the dream alive for hookers with hammer toe. I don't think I'll ever get tired of those lips. Willie, don't you think we're kidding ourselves here?

 - Meaning? - Meaning you can't go on like this. Giving up an actual life in the world to visit me here in this godforsaken place. I'm gonna be in here for years. That's no life for you. Please. I've done much worse for much longer and gotten much less out of it. I'm serious. You deserve more than this. Connor, I'm happy. Now, stop it. Thirty minutes. That's it. I can't believe how many ads we lost while Hartley was in charge. Can we just talk a little more about how much I hated him? Maybe later. So, when are we shaving the beard, do you think? - We are not. I like it. - Hmm. - We'll revisit. - Yeah. Daniel, I need Marc and you're just gonna have to deal with it. Well, since you asked so sweetly, how could I possibly say... No. I'm sorry, I'm working like an eight-year-old seamstress here, trying to turn this magazine around. I don't have time to replace him now. Hmm. Says the woman who strolls in at... Oh, look at that, 11:00. I was visiting my sick aunt in Jersey. You feel good about that crack now? Point being, you stole Marc from me. The least you could do is share him with me. Just for a while. And how does Marc feel about that? It's funny how you pretend like I have any say in it at all. Fine. But just for a while. Will there be extra compensation for this extra work? I no longer feel betrayed by you. That's compensation enough. Get up. Yeah, what have you been up to? Well, I've been... You know, work is kind of slow. - Sorry I'm late. Do more charity work. Charity work? What charity work? I've been building houses for Happy Homes. Yeah, a group of us go in and we build them with the people who are actually gonna be living in them. It's a great experience. Reminds me to be grateful. You're so good. I hate you. Me, too. Sorry. I was eavesdropping. I don't hate you, I love you. Actually, I don't know you, but I'm just grateful that you do what you do. There you go. See, that's what I want to be writing about. Stuff like that, people like that who do things like that. I'm sure I'll find a way to turn "The Most Comfortable Stiletto" into something a little more me, but I have no idea what that's gonna be. But, anyway, enough. How was your morning? Well, first yoga and a movie, then I'm gonna pick a paint color for my walls. Swiss mocha or eggnog. See? You leaving Mode was really good for us, because, before, I would have already known that, but now I'm like, "Ooh, what color is he gonna choose?" Oops. And then it hit me. Why don't I write a story called "Walk a Mile in Her Shoes?" I can feature a specific shoe, and then attach a personal story of an inspiring woman who wears that shoe in her daily life. Like a woman who builds houses for the poor in her work boot, or a charitable executive and her designer heels. I mean, comfortable stiletto. Who's really gonna believe that anyway, right? What was wrong with the assignment you were given, Betty? Back up. Nothing. I just thought that it was a little light and I could put it in my own voice. You're not paid for your voice. You're paid to imitate mine. I chose that story for you. Sorry. I just thought that... You do make a good point. The story does need something. A new writer. You can go. That's right, Betty, you get nothing. Everyone, watch Betty leave. That's it? Your boss was mean to you? That's your awful week? Let me finish. Hilda, I'm freaking out. I made Wilhelmina really, really mad. What happened? Hey, chew over the bowl, huh? She took away my piece. What do I do? Do I go back and apologize and beg for it back? Tell her I'm coming over and I'm pregnant and bloated and she better do whatever you tell her to do. Seeing as that whole image terrifies me, I think I'm just gonna ask for it back. All right, well, that's your call. Hey, what did I just say? Okay, I'm going now, and be nice to Bobby. Okay, bye. My father is mad enough that you got me pregnant, you can't afford to wreck his house. All right, it was an accident. We can't afford any more accidents around here. Look, it's a little spaghetti on an old rug. - I'll clean it up myself. All right? - Oh, no, no, I will clean it up, because that is who I am around here. I am the cleaner-upper person. I cleaned up after Justin this morning, I will clean up after you now and I will be cleaning up after this baby for the next 50 years. - Now you're mad at the baby. - No, I just... I'm sorry. I just wanted to take a shower and I haven't had time, and now I'm pregnant and I will never have time to take a shower ever again. Sweetie, come on, stop. What's stopping you from... You spilled on the rug. Excuse me, Wilhelmina? You have 30 seconds. Go. Okay, I'm sorry. Really, really sorry about what happened in the pitch meeting. I didn't mean to offend you at all. - Ten. - Wow. That was 20 seconds? Really? Is that how you want to use the rest of your time? No, right. Again, I'm sorry. I'm grateful to have the job at all, I meant no disrespect, I know my place here and I will write a great piece in your voice, I promise. Save the world on your own time, Betty. You write whatever fluff piece I give you and then maybe I'll give you something better. - Understand? - Yes. A hundred percent. I did like the title of your piece. "Walk a Mile in Her Shoes. " So, let's do that. Let's have you walk a mile in these. And write about how comfortable they are. Oh, and, Betty, I know what those soles look like with a half-mile on them, and I know what they look like with a whole mile on them. Oh, my God, are you kidding me? Seriously? - Betty. What the... - Daniel. - Are you all right? - No, I'm gonna die. Wilhelmina's making me write a first-person piece on how comfortable these heels are. What? Do you want me to talk to her? No. I'm trying to pay my dues so she'll give me something better to write. Will you walk with me please? Okay, but we have to walk fast. Marc forgot to book my car again. I'm literally running to an appointment at Coach. He's really been messing up a lot lately. Marc? Really? Marc's an amazing assistant. And no offense, Daniel, but you're not the best communicator. What? That's... Betty, but... No... What? See? I mean, I understood that, but I've worked with you for a long time. All right, I guess, maybe. All right, I've got to go left here. Okay, just peel off gently. Oh, no, no. Oh. I can never tell with you, Betty. Is this an accessory you're working, or did you actually hurt yourself? I actually fell. Into traffic. Wow. A mile and a quarter. I was ten blocks away from St. Vincent's, so I just kept going. And fortunately it was a long wait, so I could write my piece. I emailed you 200 words from the hospital. Fine. You may have another piece. Supposed to make your skin feel as soft as a baby's ass in two days. See you Thursday. - Excuse me. - Sure. Was that really moisturizer? By Ukrainian standards, yes. Connor put me in the worst mood this morning. He's pushing me away. He thinks he's doing it for me. He suggests that I go out and live my life. What? What are you doing with your face? You really are in love with him. Of course, but that's no reason to feel things for me. You have to find a way to tell him that you're not going away. Exactly. But how can I prove to him that I'm as committed to this relationship as he is to that prison sentence? I think I've got it. Oh, my God. You're not gonna break him out of jail, are you? No. Just the opposite. Darling, as happy as I am to see you, shouldn't you be out on the town right now, trading barbs with some irritating socialite? Oh, you're irritating enough, especially when you talk like that. Now listen to me. I know you're worried about me, which is touching, but I've had enough. - What the... - Just open it. We're getting married. Willie, this is crazy. I mean, I love you for trying this, but I'm still locked up in here. And marriage is my way of showing you I'm willing to be as locked up as you are. Connor, I love you, and I'm not gonna lose you just because you're in prison. - So we're doing this. - Willie, please. You can say yes now or you can say yes later, but I will come back every day until I get the answer I want. So I'll ask again. Will you marry me? Yes. You pushy, remarkable woman. I will marry you. You know, I probably shouldn't say this, but I met the perfect person for that story you wanted to do. - The one about the shoes? - Don't tell her that. Yes, tell me. Okay, well, you know how my family gives money to that organization - that does relief work in Botswana? - Aw! Anyway, I met one of the women that actually does the work. Very cool, very smart, and a grandmother. She's in town for one more week before she goes back to Africa for another tour, and she had on these funky sandals that would have been perfect for the shoe angle. - What did I just say? What? She wanted me to tell her. She doesn't know what she needs. Now I just want to write it even more. What is wrong with Wilhelmina? Why can't she see how good of a piece it could be? You know what you should do? Start your own blog. Yeah, like that... What's her name? Huffington. Only not so newsy. Actually, a blog is a great idea. Then you could write whatever you want and just publish it yourself. Well, yeah, but I don't know how to start a blog. - I could help you. - Come on. This could be the first step in creating your own magazine. Or a book deal. Or a movie. Okay, I wasn't so sure when you said "blog," but now we're talking movies, so I'm in. Guys, come on. Would anyone even read it? There are so many blogs out there. - Betty. Yes. I don't know. - Really? - Yeah-huh. Well, I mean, after hand creams and high heels, I'd be happy to inspire just one person. I'm sure I could get in touch with that woman from the relief mission. - Set up an interview. - Should I do this? - Because I think I want to do it. - Do it. - Totally. - Yes. You have to. Okay, I have a blog. Should this stuff be burning? Oh, no. Hey, Amanda? Can I use the apartment later today? I'm doing this project outside of work and I need a place to do interviews and a photo shoot. Totally. It's been empty since we moved out, anyway. Since you what? You moved out? Oh, my God, are you serious? Marc and I moved across the hall to the two-bedroom because we needed more space. How many times do I have to tell you this, Betty? - Once would be nice. - Once? Try three times. Hey, Betty, it's me. Listen, Marc and I are moving out, so... Mandy, it's Marc. Betty is 9154. That's hilarious. I keep doing that. Bye. Yeah. Did we... - Oh, um... Do you know where is Daniel Meade's... Hey, Betty. Marc and I are moving out. I told you that, right? You're sure you told me this? Yes. Now settle. It's not like you were gonna move back in, anyway. Well, no, but I didn't know you'd be giving up my apartment for good. Betty, please, you gave up your apartment a year ago when you moved back to your farm or wherever. This is not a big deal. And we're done. I'm gonna go hit the ladies'. Whatever's going on with your skin makes me feel like I need to go hose off. Hey. What are you doing right now? Skydiving. What are you doing? I'm taking you out for a fun surprise. Come on, let's go. Do you not see the woman in curlers at the end of my arms? Plus I have another appointment. You know, I figured it out. You're being mean because you're almost done raising a kid and now you got to do it all again. So, as of now, okay, this? This is "Hilda Week. " I'm taking you out every day, we're gonna do something for you, so that you know your life's not all about taking care of other people. Go. Go, or I'm going. Car's downstairs. You need to hurry or you'll be late for your cocktails with the Dsquared guys. You're sure the car's here? Because it never showed at Kors yesterday. Actually, I'm sure the car showed up. - But it didn't. - But it did. Now go. Stop, wait. Daniel. Right. - Oh! - Marc. My jacket. Shh. I got this. What are you... See? Always prepared. Spin. Where did this jacket come from? From your dry-cleaning. And it fits flawlessly. Now, get out of here. You have to be at Waverly in 10. I thought I was going to Farmhouse. Okay, all this doubting me is starting to get a little upsetting. Okay, wow. She's very sensitive. Hey, I just did my first "she. " Yeah. - So, what do you think? - I love it. "To inspire at least one person. " Mmm. Ooh! Our first interview. - Hey, there. - Hi. Come on in. - Lee, come in. - Hi. So, the first time I visited Botswana, I stayed in a gorgeous hotel on the Zambezi. Amazing views, great food, the works, and just up the road was a village of such poverty. In fact, the hotel solicits donations to help support the people who live there, but after seeing how these lovely people lived, I needed to do more than just write a check. And if you could see the smiles on their faces, the pure gratitude they feel for so little... I don't have the words, so I'll leave that to you. So, what's my surprise? The surprise is that it's closed. Ahhh! What happened? - Cut my finger. - Let me see. Okay, wait, let me get a thingy. Okay, so what am I missing here? Concert. Ace of Base. Ace of Base? - Yeah. - Oh, man. I remember how much we used to like them in high school. Love. We loved them. Yeah, I don't know what's up. You know, my friend Perry told me they're playing here Tuesday. It's Wednesday. - Get out of here. - Yeah. You know, here I am trying to make you feel like you don't have to take care of people all the time, and look at you right now. We'll just do something tomorrow. You did say it's Hilda Week, right? - That's right, I did. Yeah, let's go. - Okay. So, did you publish it yet? No, not yet. I'm scared. What if no one reads it? They will. I promise. Look, do it now while I'm on the phone with you. Mmm. Okay. Ready? What? What happened? Did it crash? No. Someone's at the door. I'll call you back. The landlord? - Mr. Z. - I sent you letters, I call your work. What are you trying to pull? What are you talking about? I want you out of here by the end of the week. And if I don't get those last two months of back rent, I am going to sue. What? Two months' back rent? That's right, two months. - But... Stop. Hold up. You make me sound like a crazy person, and you get to be all innocent. I am innocent, and you were very angry. Oh, so it's me then? I'm the worst part of your week? No. It gets worse. Oh! Keep going. Oh, sweet Betty. Don't scare me like that. Good thing I just took a leak or this could have gotten really ugly. You moved out of my apartment two months ago? And you haven't paid any rent since? Help, I'm scared. You should be, Amanda. I can't afford to pay two months of back rent. Okay, I told you about that. It is not my fault that you're deaf or whatever. Stop talking. You are going to fix this. Find the money, talk to Mr. Z, do whatever you have to do, but this is your problem, not mine. Marc, why didn't you tell me that you moved out of my apartment? God, who can remember? That was months ago. A hundred words on Wilhelmina's desk by the end of the day. No. What is that? Something for the hair, I think. It's fine, I guess. I'm doing my own thing now, and I'm very proud of it. Oh. Another hit. I have my own blog. Aw, welcome to six years ago. That was uncalled for. Aw, welcome to two years ago. Thank you. - Hey, quitter. - Fancy. - Hey. - Hey. I got three hits. And one of them said, "You inspired me. " Congratulations. I saw that. - Wait, was that you? - It was. And actually that's why I'm here. - You have a minute? - Sure. Amanda, send my calls to voicemail. Marc forgot my lunch again. I'm starving. I'll be back in 10. But these ladies from Neiman's are here to see you. Really? So, I thought our meeting was tomorrow, but clearly it's not, because you're here today, looking so lovely, I might add. I think you remember where my office is, just down the hall to the right. I'll be there in a jiff, I promise. Thank you so much for coming. Where the hell is Marc? He just left with Willie. Oh, of course he did. Ever since we've been sharing him, he's been a total screw-up. You know, he's been getting my appointments wrong, he forgets my lunch every other day. He actually sent me to the wrong bar last night, can you believe that? And the guys from Dsquared had to come meet me. I looked like a total ass. Okay, no offense, but this is totally your fault. Marc's a genius, and you're not the best communicator in the world. See? I knew what you meant just then, but we've had sex, so it's definitely you. And Willie would kill to have Marc back. Oh, my... That's it. That little... That's exactly what he's doing. Okay, that right there? I have no idea what you just said. So, guess what. You remember when I said my friend told me Ace of Base was playing Tuesday? And you said, "It's Wednesday, dumbass. " I don't think I said "dumbass," but... Well, I was wrong. They're playing today. Bobby! Well, it might take you a few tries, Talercio, but when you come through, you really come through. That's right. Plus we're having ourselves a little sidewalk picnic like we used to, except instead of candy bars and beer, we're gonna have actual food. Oh. And prenatal vitamins. Oh, my God. You think of everything. It's home. Let me get this. Hi, honey, what's up? It's Justin. Oh, no. Are you all right? Okay. All right. Just give me... No, Justin, it's fine. I'm not that far. All right? Justin, don't worry. Okay. I love you. Okay, bye. He's sick. How sick? Sick enough that I got to go. But I want you to stay. This was the best idea. I can't stay. Come on, this is Hilda Week. So what? You just have fun and come over tomorrow, you'll tell me all about it. So sweet. Thank you. Have a good time. Stay, have fun. So, after hearing Lee's amazing stories about Botswana, I dropped by the mission offices to drop off another check. Really? I love that. God, Betty, what these people do... Here, I've got to show you this. Look at this map. Okay, here is the village, and this is how far away the river is. Now they have a pump in their village because of us. - What? - Nothing. I just... I've never seen you like this. So excited and I love that you're experiencing this. Good. Me, too. Because that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I spoke with Lee and she said if I wanted, I could volunteer for the next tour. For the what? For a tour of what? - Of Africa? - Yeah. Wait, like, Africa-Africa? Yeah, look, I know it sounds sudden, but I want to do this. I want to leave with them next week. Hello, I'm here to see Connor Owens. I'd like a table in the corner, away from everyone else, please. It's funny how it only takes 20 bucks and five minutes on the computer to get re-ordained to marry you and Connor, yet it's completely illegal for me to marry a man myself. Are you gonna bring that up every time I get married? Excuse me, what's his name again? Connor Owens. Says here he's been transferred. What? What are you talking about? Transferred where? I'm afraid I can't tell you that, but he's definitely no longer at this prison. This is not possible. Connor Owens has not been transferred. You go get him and tell him Wilhelmina Slater is here now for him. - Go get him. - Ma'am, he's gone, but there is an envelope for Wilhelmina Slater here. I don't want an envelope. I want him. We're supposed to be getting married today, you fool! Don't you think he would have told me if he was being transferred? Damn you. Connor. Connor! You're gonna have to calm her down or we will. Willie, maybe you should... No. Did he do this? Did he make this happen? He did, didn't he? - Answer me. - Willie. Don't look at me like that. Six months? Why do you have to go for a whole six months? Well, they want you to commit to at least that long so that they know you're serious. Wait, "at least that long"? Matt, this is a big move. Betty. Look, you said that I needed to find meaning in my life and you were right. I mean, I've wasted so much time asking myself, "What do I need? What do I want?" But your story got me to ask a different question. Like, "What do other people need?" What is this gonna mean for us? Well, would it have to change anything? How could it not? Matt, you're gonna be living on the other side of the world for a long time. And I thought that you would be happy for me. Look, I feel like there's some perfect thing I'm supposed to say right now. And it's... This is big, and it's sudden, and... I don't know, I have to wash my hair for Wilhelmina. Look, I've got to... I have to go. Betty, look, you said you wanted to inspire one person, and you did. Africa? Matt can't survive in Africa. It's crazy, right? Living in a house made of sticks, looking for a place to plug in his blow-dryer. Please, getting his hair all tall like that? That takes a blow-out. I know. It's just so Matt, you know. It's like one minute he's a lawyer, the next he's an artist, the next he's African, and I'm just supposed to go along with all of it? Like I don't mind being another temporary thing in his life that he will eventually move on from? I mean, he should be considering me in this, right? Hey, I don't like to get all up in your business. But hell, yes, he should. - Thank you. - Mmm-hmm. But I'm not allowed to say that. No. Because then I sound like a selfish monster telling the person I love, "No, Matt, you can't go to Africa to help people. " Hey, you sound however you want. Ah. Who's that? Papi's supposed to be at work. Ah, they crack me up. Bobby. What are you doing here? When did you get here? I got here about five minutes ago. I brought this one some of my Uncle Hugo's special fever soup. It's guaranteed to work. It's hideous. The ingredients are chicken broth, evil, and dirt. Hey, you. Just drink it. You'll be up and dancing by tomorrow morning. I swear on Madonna's cheeks. Hey, I told you, it's Hilda Week. Upstairs, go. Read a book, take a bath, whatever you want. I got this. Ahhh! That's it. Excuse me, Wilhelmina. I'm sorry to barge in, but I would like a second of your time. I need to ask you to please stop torturing me. My foot hurts, my armpits hurt, and now my scalp is burning. All because I wanted to write something that maybe could make the world a little bit better. So, that's it. That's... That's what I wanted to say. Today was supposed to be my wedding day. To Connor. But he made himself disappear. With money or connections or I don't... I don't know. And the worst part is he thinks he did it for me, so I can live my life. I know how to chase people who've wronged me but I don't know how to chase people who say they love me and then do this. Well, obviously he loves you. That couldn't have been easy for him. He thinks this is love? If he loved me, he'd do what I want. Not this. Please go. - Hey. - Hey. - Thanks for coming. - Of course. I wanted to talk to you, too. I feel bad about dumping all that on you before. Yeah, I totally freaked out. Yeah, of course you did. And I've been thinking about it and maybe you're right. You know, maybe for our sake I should stay in New York. Maybe I could do some good here and maybe I was just - getting way ahead... - Wait, wait, whoa, Matt. Stop. That's a lot of maybes. I didn't mean it that way. I... You have to go. You have to do this. - Are you serious? - Very. Are you sure about this? If you are. I am. But the one thing you cannot do is doubt how I feel about you. Betty, you changed my life, and that lasts forever, no matter where we may stand in the world. Well... Now I have something to write about. Goodbyes. Coffee. - Coffee? Marc, I asked you to get my dinner. - Darn it, I knew I forgot something. - Okay, Marc, you know what? I understand why you're making all these mistakes. You want me to fire you so you can go back to working for Wilhelmina. If that's what you want to do, you should just do it. Get on that scale. Since when do I have a scale in my office? Since you have me in here. Hop on. - I lost eight pounds. - Yes. Because I "messed up" your lunches and "forgot" to book your cars, so you'd stop eating like a lonely girl and actually use those legs a little bit. And look here. One, two, three. That's how many times you were photographed this week. Let me ask you something, how many times were you photographed last month? - Once. - Exactly. But this time you were outside the Waverly, where there is actually paparazzi, instead of the Farmhouse, where there is not. And you were in this slimming jacket that looks great in black and white. And furthermore, are you aware that you come off a little bit needy? I do? Really? - Do I? - You do. Which is why I let the boys from Dsquared go to the wrong bar, because those queens should go to you. And, PS, it worked. Dsquared, Michael Kors, Coach. They're all back. So, as you can see, in actuality, I did all this for you. Unbelievable. Well, I... Why didn't you just come tell me about all this stuff? Well, because when I told you to shave your beard, you refused. But lucky for me, now you have to shave it. Because there's gum in it. There isn't gum in my beard. Why... What are you... We can do this your way or my way. Coming. Coming. Here. It's not everything, but I sold some of my hair to make up for the rent money. But your hair looks the same. Okay, I sold extensions. Used ones. But I still want you to have the cash. Look, Betty, I moved out right after Matt chose you over me. I needed to start over and I was too hurt and mad to talk to you about it. It was so stupid. Well, now we've both lost him. He's moving away for a while. Oh. - Don't smile. - I'm not. You're totally smiling. So, what are you gonna do? I guess I'm starting over, too. Well, I heard about an open apartment, and it's close to me, which I wouldn't totally hate. It's Betty. Can we talk? Oh, that is a rough week. I told you. So, what do you say? Can we figure something out? Maybe you could raise my rent a little? I could pay you back over time? What if I raise Amanda's rent and make her pay me back? Yeah, that could work. Did you ever write that piece on goodbyes? Just the first paragraph. Why? My old lady left me six months ago. She said I let myself go. Point is, I get it. I know what it means to have to start over and everything. You read me that paragraph and I'll let you move back in. - Really? - Really. Um, yeah, sure. I can do that. - You got it there? - Right here. It's just a rough draft, though. - I won't judge. - Okay. "I've had to say goodbye more times than I would have liked, "but everyone can say that. " "And no matter how many times we do it, "even when it's for the greater good, it still stings. " - You think she bought it? - Yeah. I'll have my guy make the deposit today.
