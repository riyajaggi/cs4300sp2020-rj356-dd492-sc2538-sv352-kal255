 Hilda, I'm so sorry, but it has to be my last shampoo. I've got to go! Betty, take it easy! I like it rough, but only on the weekends. If you know what I mean. Ow! Sorry, Sammy. But I've got to get going. I'm just anxious about getting to work. Aunt Betty, don't worry about it. I'll just stay home from school and help out. I'm not double-booking haircuts to make money to get you into private school just so you can get rejected 'cause you're too stupid 'cause you skipped public school. Here we go, ladies. A little dulce and cafecito on the house.

 Hey, Sammy. Betty tell you about the big promotion? No, what big promotion? Yeah, well, I got promoted to associate features editor at Mode. But don't you worry, I will be back to assistant in no time. Mi hija, don't talk like that. Sit up. Well, it's true. My first issue as editor is going to print, and I am the only one without anything in it. Plus, Matt is killing all of my pitches and basically making my life impossible. - You know you're hurting me, right? - Matt is a spoiled bitch. Mom! I'm sorry. I'm just saying, everybody's all sweet when you're in love, but it's when something bad happens, that's when a person shows their true colors.

 I don't know who he is anymore. Well, I don't know if you guys know this, but currently, I'm working in the fashion industry. - What? - Oh, yeah. I'm doing the remodel on Evan Grant's condo down in the West Village. Evan Grant? The Dolce & Gabbana men's designer who breathed life into the fur-trimmed hoodie? Must be. I heard him on the phone saying he's leaving the Dolce and going to the Gucci. What? Now, it's supposed to be a secret, all right? No one's supposed to know about that. Let's be honest, who the hell cares? Oh, Sammy, if I could get the first published interview with the new creative director at Gucci, do you know what that would do for me at work? Well, maybe Sammy can hook you up with the guy and you can ask him all about it. - Whoa, whoa, Betty. - Yes! Sammy promised to "hook me up" with a salon chair two months ago. You see it here? Well, anything you could do, Sammy, it would really help. There are a lot of people lining up for my job. I don't want to make it any easier for them. Thank you. Bye! Oh, my God, Wilhelmina is going to freak! Claire and Papa Hartley killed the Cotton Club shoot. Now Baby Hartley's calling an emergency editors' meeting. Morning, guys! - Hey! - Hate you! Oh, yay. I'm so glad that I get to catch a rare glimpse of the last living Monchhichi waddling into a meeting that I should be in! Wow! You're, like, oozing self-pity today. Something's up. Oh, my God, happy birthday! We are not talking about that, got it? One more mention and heads will roll. Pretty blonde heads that don't have their original nose. Mean. Oh, oh, sorry, Betty. I always sit here. Remember? Okay. Um... Matt, is there another chair? Oh, yeah, I asked for one for you. Guess that's all they had. A beanbag? - Ow! You all right down there? Yep! I'm fine. How is Betty the editor of a fashion magazine? That would be like me being the editor of, like, a mechanics magazine. Or you being the editor of a magazine. Ooh, pick up your face. Wait, you just totally slammed me. At least you were considered for the job. Nobody around here even takes me seriously. Damn it, you just made me think about my life. With the Cotton Club shoot dead, that means that there is an opening in this issue, so I'm gonna need... Wait, I'm sorry. Did you say an opening in this issue? Yes, that's what I said. I will be taking pitches all day. So I need good ideas, but think cheap, okay? The budget is only going to be about... Uh, Betty, can you not text right now? Yeah, no, I'm sorry, it's business-related. See, I was shampooing this guy's hair this morning and he said he might have a story for us. Oh. It wasn't, like, a creepy shampoo. My sister has a hair salon, and it was just busy, so she needed my help. I'm her sister, what am I gonna say, no? Okay, stop. We're uncomfortable. Okay, so come to me whenever you have your pitches. All right? Let's go. Matt? Matt. - Matt! - Yeah? I think I might have a pitch. Actually, a pretty good one. Nothing personal, but I can't take "might" to Wilhelmina. Thank you. No, I know that. I know. But you know what? The way you said that, that did feel a little personal, and I would just appreciate it... - Okay, Betty, don't, please... - That tone of... I am trying to keep my job here just like you are. And I don't know if you realize this, but your UN fiasco made us both look bad. So, which one of us is making this personal? They are so in love it's disgusting. I want that. Take it. I just want her job. Are we obsessed with Betty? Yes. And it's exhausting. I know, and I'm sorry. But that psychedelic misfit toy is living my dream. Would I let someone take my dream from me? Or would I find a way to take it back? I never think to destroy someone for me. That's called low self-esteem. I can't believe this is still healing. How hard did you hit him? It's like his stubble actually fought back. Oh, no. I can see you, Daniel. I hate my new desk. Aren't you supposed to be at a support group meeting right now? Daniel, is that true? I didn't want to go, all right? Some sad bereavement group is not gonna help me get over Molly's death. That's not what I need right now. What? Support? Guidance? Care? Shared experience? Which of these is the problem, Daniel? Come on. You're kind of trapping me with your words there. Daniel, this sort of thing can't keep happening. As much as I would like for you to punch Matt in the face again, right now, there is another meeting this afternoon. If I find out that you're not there, I'm gonna physically carry you myself. Got it? Betty, did you know that editors' calls get transferred to assistants during editors' meetings? Yep. I used to get them when I worked for Daniel. Ah, remember how irritating it is? Please hold for your pretty sister. When you're done listening in on Betty's phone call, I need my coffee. Hilda, did you get my text? Yeah, I got it. I called Sammy and guess what? - The stupid goombah came through. - No! He did? For you, a big meeting with a fancy designer today at 4:00. For me? Nothing. Today? What? This is amazing! Hilda, if I can get this story, I can get it in this issue! Ah! What was that? Did you just burp at me? No, I don't know what that was. You know what you do, right? You go into Matt's office and you rub this in his spoiled rotten face. No way, Jose. I am keeping this one to myself. If I want to keep my job, I have to go around Matt. He's made that very clear. All right, I will text you the address. I gotta go. Okay. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Hilda! I love you! It's about time! I'm trying to find somebody to cover a busboy shift at the restaurant. - Let me do it. - What? - Yeah. - No. - Why? - I said "busboy," not "bus you. " Papi, wait! I really need the money to get Justin out of that awful school. I promise you I will do such a good job. Ridiculous. - Okay. For Justin. - Yeah. Now get over there early so they can train you. Please, papi, I think I know how to take dirty plates off of a table. Mizrahi's TV show? Cindy Crawford's skin care line? Have I stepped into a time warp? - Is this the '90s? - Well, actually, you know, those things are happening right now... Don't give me these tired pitches to replace my canceled photo shoot. Now I know fashion's not really your thing, but you can at least try to fake it better. We're done, get out. Oh, please, tell me some good news. I'm not enjoying my day. You are now. I found Connor. Feel like a trip to Bermuda? You're going down there now? Well, what are you gonna do, march up to him and say, "Hey, Conn, remember that money you stole from Mode? Hand it over"? No, Marc, I'm gonna make him an offer. He can either come back to the US with my armed bounty hunter and stand trial for his crimes, or he can give me what's left of the money and I can buy out Hartley and the Meades and... You know the drill. They're clearly trying to push me out of this company. I can see it in their old, droopy eyes. Are you gonna be able to do this? I mean, you did have feelings for that man. Whatever feelings I had, Marc, won't get in the way. I am no amateur. - Where's she off to? Club a seal? - Whatever, she's gone. Gives me time to deal with Suarez. Apparently, she's got some huge story that's gonna save her ass at Mode. She has a meeting with a mysterious "he" at 4:00. Ooh, what's the story? Doesn't matter. I'm not gonna let her get it. And if young Betty doesn't get something in soon, her job is as good as mine. "Young Betty"? You mean because you're older than her? Okay, why don't you just kick me? Kick me in the special parts. No more birthday. Got it? None! - Happy birthday! - Happy birthday! Oh, my gosh. How'd you know? I did office birthdays the whole time I was an assistant. But now that that's your job, I thought I would do one more because I knew you would never get yourself a cake. You get me. You really get me. To be honest, I almost forgot just because I had a terrible morning. But now I think it's gonna be a great day. And I hope it's gonna be great for you, too, Marc. Make a wish! Daniel, swear to me that you're really there. I swear. How do you want me to prove it to you? What... Excuse me, will you please tell my friend where I am right now? Please? A crappy school. Support group. This phone smells like cheese. See? I'm gonna go to the whole thing. It's gonna be really good for you, Daniel. I know it's gonna be good for me. Goodbye, Betty. Oh, no, you don't. Get back here. - Oh. Hey, uh... - You promised that person you'd stay. You had me vouch for you. Don't rope me in and then make me seem like a liar. It's rude. Come on. I had no idea I was gonna be meeting him in his home. I thought it was gonna be an address for his office or something. Well, the only way I could get him down here was I had to tell him he had to pick a shower tile today or the project was gonna take another two weeks. He's a little ticked off, but so what? The way you just said that, that sounds like he doesn't know he's gonna meet me. He doesn't. Okay, calm down. You are a very impressive young lady. You just be you and he's gonna love you. I have two minutes, Sammy. Two! I made a million decisions today. I do not want to be doing this right now. Here, would you take this from me before I throw it against the wall? That's it? Twelve shades of blue? I cannot be doing this right now. Would somebody just decide? Somebody just pick a tile for me. Someone? Anyone? Who the hell are you? Hi. I'm Betty Suarez. I work at Mode magazine. - Mode? - Mode. I'm a features editor there, and I was wondering if you would let me do a story on your transition from Dolce & Gabbana to Gucci. Whoa! No, wait. How do you know about that? Are people talking about that? Is it out there? It can't be! No, no, no. No one knows. Just me. Just me. What... I don't... What are you even doing here? Don't look at me like that. She's a good kid, all right? She's a friend from the neighborhood. She's just trying to save her job. Oh, really? And how are you gonna save your job? No, Mr. Grant, please don't fire Sammy. He was just trying to help me. In a really weird way. I'm gonna leave you my card and you can call me. If you want. I hope you will. Either way, it's fine. I promise I will not tell anyone about your story. I can't even pick a tile. How am I supposed to decide in three seconds if I should give my story to an 11-year-old editor who broke into my house? Well, I would just put them all up. I like all of the blues together. Really? - Why do I like that? - Well, because I just stole your idea. You know, that's what you do when you show your suits and you dress your models in the same color shirt and tie. The blue on the blue, the gray on the gray, just slightly different shades, which you said in your 2008 fashion week interview was to bring attention to the suit and not the tie and the shirt. All right, we'll have dinner tonight. See if we're a good match. If we are, great. If not, you do not break into my house again. - Got it? - Yeah. Call my office. And Sammy? Put them all up! Blue on blue! You got it! Huh? You couldn't take it, either? "Either"? You're the one who made me go back in there. And I was right to. Those meetings are very helpful. But? - But this one sucked so hard. - Thank you! How about that chick who was wailing about her 100-year-old grandmother that fell and broke her hip and got pneumonia and died two days later? I know, two days at 100. It doesn't sound like such a bad way to go. Right? I mean, try losing somebody your own age. Yeah. You, too? These donuts are old as hell. What do you say I treat us to some fresh ones? I feel like I owe you. - What's all this about? - Oh! I'm trying to figure out what Betty's big story is so I can kill it. But I don't know her password. - Try "burger. " - I already did. And "cupcake" and "Menudo" and "Daniel's lady. " What are you doing? Uh... I'm writing you a thank-you note. Well, a thank you and an apology. Ever since you got this promotion, I have been letting my jealousies get the better of me. So, can I start over? Can we go back to being whatever we were before? Well, to be honest, that is why I got you the cake. I wanted you to know that despite all of this, we're still, you know, whatever we were before. Yay. So, hey, how did that big meeting go? Oh! Lt, uh... It was fine. Scary at first, but you know, it just turned into dinner at my dad's place. Nothing... Nothing big. Wow. Sounds exciting. Where does your dad work again? Frankie's? You know, I have to get back to doing some research. - Do you need anything else? - Nope. That's it. Have fun. Willie. Can you believe there's traffic in Bermuda? Well, luckily I've chased felons here before, so I know all the shortcuts. Did you find Connor? We're outside his hotel waiting for his return. Claire give you any trouble about me being gone? No. But Betty, on the other hand, is a headache that just won't quit! She's got some big important dinner tonight that, clearly, I have to ruin. But I don't want her to know that it was me who ruined it. So, now I have to figure out some way of getting Betty to come undone at dinner without me being there. Everyone has their Achilles' heel, and no one's is more obvious than Betty's. Oh, my God, I think I just found Betty's Achilles' sensible... If you'd like to make a call, please... Willie? I try to be a good friend, but there is a limit. Wait, don't leave. What would you say if I told you that I figured out a super fun way for you to prove your worth around here? I would say it's nighttime. Tell me tomorrow. Oh, wow, that doesn't sound like a woman who wants to be taken seriously. That sounds like a girl who wants to go out, get drunk, fall in bed with a man who doesn't love her, come back here tomorrow and answer phones for the next 20 years. Or at least until the hard living catches up to her and Mode wouldn't dare let that grizzled face out from behind a cubicle! - I'm listening. - Wait here. - Matt! I just had the best idea! - For the magazine? No. No, for you! Remember today when you brought all those pitches to Willie and she shamed you in the worst way? Yeah, thanks for reminding me. Sorry. But come on, can you blame her? You really don't know anything about fashion, and as long as she thinks that you're only here because... Well, that's not important. No, no, no, it sounds important. Only thinks I'm here because... Because you want to be near Betty. But relax, she only thinks that because everyone else does. Everyone else does? Matt. Matt. Matt. Matt. You haven't exactly been soaking up information, trying to prove that you actually belong here. Have you? No, I guess not. But it's not that easy. Or is it? It's free dinner at Frankie's super-hot restaurant with a not-hideous billionaire whose father owns half this company. A man who one day may take over himself. All you have to do is teach him a little bit about fashion, which nobody knows better than you, and he'll totally see that you deserve a brighter future here at Mode. I don't see the downside. I hate his shoes. - Here, put these on. - Why? Have fun! And that's what I've been doing there... Here you go, Miss Suarez. Your usual. And for the gentleman, vodka rocks, two limes. - Thank you. - Sure. And how about a little starter from the kitchen? One of Miss Suarez's favorites, on the house. - Wow, they really treat you well here. - Yes, they do. Because they are my family and they are pretending. This is my sister, Hilda, and my father, Ignacio. - Hi! How you doing? - Mucho gusto. Tambi?n. Okay. Oh! Right, well, bon app?tit. Sorry about that. They just want this to be special for me. - They're like that. - Yeah, my family's the exact same way. - Oh, really? - God, no. They're horrible people. - Would you guys consider adopting? - Oh! Uh... For free clothes, yeah! My sister and my nephew would love to... Hey, Betty. Oh! Oh, good. You turned so white I thought I would turn around and see a gunman. - Or a Kardashian. Who is that? - Nobody. They're nobody. Okay. That's my bosslex-boyfriend and that's my friendlex-roommate. Oof! And they're on a date? No! A date? No, they're so not each other's type. I mean, he's rich, so he's her type, but no. Do you want to go somewhere else? No. No, why would we? Oh, okay. Maybe Betty's not on a date five tables away. A date? Even if she were, you know, we can stay. Okay. Order me a martini. I'll be right back. I gotta whiz. Oh, I am so sorry. Two minutes. - Mmm-hmm. - Hmm... Is that Matt with Amanda? What are they doing here? Are they, like, on some kind of date or something? No. I don't know. Why does everybody keep saying "date"? Two people can have dinner. It's called "friends. " So, what, they're friends now? Hilda, please, don't make this a thing, okay? I can't think about that. I need to focus on my meeting with Evan, which Matt can't even know about. All right? - Promise. - Of course. Are you... ...seriously on a date with Amanda in my father's restaurant with Betty sitting right over there? I don't think that's any of your business. Just like it's none of my business that Betty is sitting 10 feet away from me with whoever that guy is. That sounds like you are on a date. But you know what? That's cool. Because Betty's on a date, too. - Really? - Yeah. Well, good. Good. I guess we're even then. I completely understand, but this is my point, if you release a statement to the press, the excitement lasts, what, a day? If you let me do a story at Mode, then we can feature any of your new designs, along with a huge announcement, and then it's a whole event, not just a piece of news. No, it makes sense. Although, now I'll have to finish those new designs. If they have designer block, that's what I'm suffering from right now. I can't decide whether I want a thin knot on my... I'm so sorry. One second, I promise. Don't worry, I told him you were on a date, too. You're welcome. Hilda, you... Wait, what? He said he was on a date? - Yes. - No. - Yeah. - Why would... He can't... No! Hilda, what are you doing to her? You should be picking up plates! Papi, I've got to tell her what kind of guy Matt really is! Please! Listen, you know what you've got to do? You've got to go out there and rub your date in his face, just like he's rubbing his in yours. No. No. I can't... I can't do that. Evan's not even my date. I can't deal with this right now! I won't! I can't! I have to focus on the meeting. This isn't happening! This is not happening! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Here, let me help. No, no, I got it. I got it. Please. Just... - Ow! That's hot. Ow, ow! - No, no, it's okay. - Sorry. - Please just go back to your seat. Please. You okay? Are you all right, sir? I just... I can't stand the feeling that I don't know what to do. What comes next. What's gonna help. You've just got to try and find something that works for you. I try everything. As far as mourners go, I think I fall on the needy side. Is anything working? Actually, there's this thing I heard that really stuck with me. It's this idea that when you lose someone, you should do one thing every day that makes you feel totally alive. You know, because it feels like there's so much death. I don't exactly know what would make me feel like that right now. It's been a while. I hear you. Unfortunately for me, a lot of the things that used to make me feel alive are illegal. Wait. What's that smile? When I was a kid, we used to spend the summers in the Hamptons. My brother and I would stay up and we'd sneak into the neighbors' yards and swim in their pools, which was kind of weird because we had a pool. But it didn't matter, because every time we did it, I always thought, "We are, for sure, the coolest kids ever. " Huh. You know, I didn't do my feel-alive thing for today. So is that a... Hey! Sorry to bother, but I've got to get a picture of my little sister's first big meeting. Get over there. Squeeze together. Squish together. I said we have to do something soft and pretty and... Look at him. Okay, close together. Squish, squish. Is this okay? Yeah. Really see you. Yeah, get cozy. Like you're friends. Hilda! Take the picture. Cool! That was great! Thanks, saving it! So, do you want to talk about classic designers, current trends, or the next big thing that only I and a few Japanese schoolgirls know about? All of it. But you know, first, you've got to try this salad. - It's amazing. - Oh, no food. Just liquor. I save all my caloric intake for dessert. - Oh. - Ow! - Ow! Ow! I got an eyelash in my... - Here. It hurts! Get it out. Get it out. Get it out. Did you get it? Get it, get it, get it. It hurts so much. Got it. You know what? Why don't I come back over there and show you some stuff that I've had published at Mode and online? Just side by side, if that's okay. It makes it easier to... Just... It's easier to... Oh! This here is... Um... But here... Oh, there it is. If you want a tailor, go to the random woman at the dry cleaner and you'll save a lot of money. Marc? This trip is a total disaster. Connor checked out this morning. And I suspect he was tipped off by our bargain bounty hunter. We need a new bounty hunter. Next time, I prefer one in brown. Hello, Willie. Connor! - Whoa! - Give that back to me. I just want to catch up a bit before you call the goon and start the blackmailing. - I've no idea what you're talking about. - Don't pretend with me. I know every move you've made since I left. You know, I may be a crook, but my feelings for you were real. And I thought you felt the same way about me. Any feelings I had for you died the day you stole from me! How could you, Connor? I put my life into that magazine! Everything I had! And you took it. You walked off and you left me with nothing. I didn't really take from you. I took for you! And I'd do it all again. - Come away with me. - You are insane. Yeah, but I'm happy. Are you? Wilhelmina, you have always lived your life a certain way. But when you're ready to pursue another option with me, just put it out there, I'll find you again. But not until then. Ah, and one more thing. - Make it? I think we made it. - I don't think anybody saw us. - Actually, we're not done yet. - Go get the lights. Uh... Natalie, just so we're clear, I'm not really ready for... For what? Sex? My boyfriend OD'd two months ago, and I didn't have time to shower today, so you're safe. - Oh, right. - It's fine. - Oh, my God, it's cold. - That's cold. - I can't believe we did this. - Oh, my God. Okay, bye. That was Marc. I told him we're fine, but Betty is a sloppy drunk and she's being all handsy with some dude. He totally loves me right now. That was when I sprouted wings and flew directly into the sun. - I'm sorry. - Okay. I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that. Well, I do. You want to see what's going on over there? - Go see what's going on back there. - No, I don't. - This meeting's over. Good night. - No. No! I'm... No! Please, I promise I... I don't know and I don't care what is going on between the two of you, but what you did tonight was unforgivable. - What did we do? - Oh, that is so you, Amanda. Just playing innocent while you throw yourself at the nearest billionaire. - Oh! Back that projector up! - Yeah. Betty, I don't think that we were the ones drawing attention to ourselves. - Oh, please, Matt, you were all over her! - What, me? Me? - What about you and that guy? - Whoa! Okay, stop! I just realized what's been going on here. You know, it is one thing to flirt with me. You're a man, I'm me, it happens. But to do it just to get back at Betty? Nobody uses this to make that jealous. I guess I was stupid to think that you actually wanted to hear what I had to say. No, Amanda, I... You know, just because your date was bad... - It wasn't a date. ... doesn't mean you have to... - Actually, it was really important! - Hey! Hey! All right! Into the kitchen, here we go. That was a meeting! A very important meeting! With a very important man who had a great story for our magazine! Who you might have recognized if you worked at Mode for any other reason but to torture me! Do you know how hard I have worked for this promotion? How long I have waited? And you are ruining it! You are ruining something that means so much to me! I know! I know I am, and I can't help it! - What? - You're right. I am awful to you, but I can't stop myself because I can't stand seeing you happy when I am in so much pain. And you probably can't understand that because you are so good. You're not some spoiled rich kid who can't handle it when he doesn't get his way, but apparently that's who I am. And the worst thing is that with every word I say, I know I am ruining whatever hope we had of fixing this relationship. I don't know what just happened. He told you who he is. It's from the bodega. I remembered you were waiting for dessert, but you left before you got it, so... Is that it? Look, I've been kind of a monster lately, and unfortunately, you were one of the people I hurt. I mean, you were nice enough to share your considerable wisdom with me, which I desperately need, and I disrespected you. - My "considerable wisdom," huh? - Yeah. - What? Too arch? - No. Whatever. I wish I knew half what you know. What I'm trying to say is I'm sorry. You're a smart, interesting woman, and you should be treated like one. So I'll see you tomorrow. - Hey, Matt? - Yeah? You know what really makes me angry? I didn't even get to say goodbye to her. Who says you have to say goodbye? I mean, why do we have to give up on relationships with people we've lost? Why can't we still have them, but in a different way? Why don't you talk to her? Talk to Molly right now under the stars. No. Come on. I'm not that guy. I don't... I don't do that. Don't be such a dude. Come on. - I can't do that. - Oh, my God! Was he always this much of a wuss when you knew him? Okay, all right. Um... Hi, Molly. I'm sorry I didn't get to say goodbye. I think I need to stop being so angry now. I guess I was just afraid if I wasn't angry enough you'd think, you know, I didn't care. I really need you to know that I... I did care. So much. I still do. I bet she gets that. Yeah. It feels like she does. No, Amanda, please don't close the door on me. Wow, a lot of traffic in here tonight. Amanda, I'm sorry. What I said was mean and unfair. Well, thank you. And just so you know, I only went out with him because Marc said Matt was insecure about work and it would be a really good opportunity for me to step up... Wait. Wait, Marc set you up? Mmm-hmm. Did he tell you to go to my father's restaurant? Yeah, he made the reservation. Oh, my God, that bitch! Yes, what you just said. Tonight after you left, Matt sort of broke down and said all this stuff about being a bad guy and... I don't know. For the first time in a long time, I saw the good guy underneath. The guy I fell for. The one who still cares about me. And now I'm stuck. And I don't know what to do. Am I right about him? Or should I just move on? Honestly, Betty, I think it's time you moved on.
