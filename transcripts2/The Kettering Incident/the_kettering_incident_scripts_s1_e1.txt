 All right, just trying to help. You know your way back to the High Street? Yes, I do. Engineers are going to have to rethink London's flood protection by the middle of this century. We brought together... Message received at 7:43 p.m. Anna, it's Tim. I'm at the restaurant, waiting, and your absence is noted. Should I be surprised? Message received at 8:15 p.m. Anna, come on, where are you? I'm looking like a dick here and I'm starving. Please call me. Message received at 4.48 a.m. ♪ Oh... ♪ When she comes walking over ♪ Now I've been waiting to show her ♪ Crimson and clover ♪ Clover ♪ Clover ♪ Clover Dr Macy, Tim is looking for you. Bring Molly Smith's file through, please. Doctor. We have to put her dose up. - Start her on the new antibody. - Are you sure? We're running out of time. Psst. Hi, Molly. Hey. Did you get your flower? Is that for me? For when I'm gone. Molly. Nurse Jenny said I might go home soon. Did she now? Will you miss me when I go home? I'll miss you very much. Can we read the poetry book you bought me? Of course. "I went out to the hazel wood "Because a fire was in my head "And cut and peeled a hazel wand "And hooked a berry to a thread "And when white moths were on the wing "And moth-like stars were flickering out "I dropped the berry in a stream..." What's that? You're bleeding. It's all right. It's all right. Happens all the time. I'll see you in a sec, all right? There's a couple of micro lesions near the angular gyrus and parietal lobe. Is that significant? I'm not concerned about them. You say you lost seven hours? Thereabouts. Were you drinking? Till I passed out in a gutter? No, I was meant to meet Tim for dinner. That still on? Probably not any more. His wife will be pleased. They're separated. You lost time like this before? No. A long time ago, when I was a teenager. It was only an hour or so. - Same symptoms? - Mmm. Nose bleeds, migraines? Did you suffer any kind of trauma as a kid? No. Why? Post-traumatic stress in childhood can recur in adulthood if it's not dealt with... So now I have PTSD? Christ, I haven't been in a war. When did you last visit home? This is my home. - Is it? Oh, shit, it's Tim. I have to go. Hold your horses. I have someone you could talk to. He's a friend. I've probably mentioned him before. I don't need a psychiatrist, Deidre. Or a husband. I'm not bloody mad. Far from it. All you have is the fear of it. Tim, if this is about last night... Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Why? Have a seat. What are you doing with that? I'll talk about that later. Talk about it now. I'm handing Molly over to Andrew Cohen. - What? - You've been absent lately, your paperwork is behind... - I know, but I'm fine now. - Are you? Andrew Cohen's a tosser. I'm a much better doctor than he is. Look I'm sorry, but it's not negotiable. Thanks for the vote of confidence, Tim. Anna, wait. I take it you know your patient Frank Henderson died last night? No, I didn't. Haven't done my rounds yet. Yeah, but you were here. No, I wasn't on duty. You know that. What's this about, Tim? A security guard came to see me this morning... With this. It's security footage from last night. So? I think I'd better leave you to watch this in private. Christ. No. Oh, shit. Fuck this. We promised him we'd do it for another month. - He'll kill us if we stop. - I'm not scared of him. I'll be out of here soon anyway. Yeah, sure. Where you gonna go? London. As if. You wouldn't leave without me. We're not together any more, Dane! It's freezing. Let's just go back. We can't. What was that? Probably a fish. Don't turn that on. - Shit! - Shh. Jesus, Chloe. - Get it out! Get it out! It's frozen. The fuck is going on? Look. Look at that. Jesus, turn off the torch, will you? We'll get caught. It's just the bloody Aurora. It's not. It's more than that. It's them. Chloe. No worries. What the hell are you doing parked here? It's the middle of the road! Sorry. I think my battery's flat or I've run out of petrol. I'm not sure. Aren't you cold? How long have you been here? Can I have a lift, please? Don't you have luggage? Where are you from? London. What're you doing here? Visiting. On your own? Yes. Why? Thanks for the lift. Hey, Dad. Lize, check this out. Don't get my daughter involved in your Greenie shit. Lize? You stay away from her. - Right? - Yeah. Can I help you? Just a black coffee, thanks. Anything else? Could you tell me what day it is? Friday. All day. Are they working? I need the Internet. Uh, the Internet's down. We got a guy meant to come out and fix it, but don't hold your breath. Is there... I need a tow truck. My car's stuck on the highway. - Uh... - Well, I'll be. Anna Macy? We haven't seen you in years. No. Anna Macy? Are you back for your father's retirement? Yes. I can give you a ride back to your car. - No, it's fine. - I finish at 4:00. I'll pick you up. Okay. Where? Your dad's. There you go. You got a bloody nerve coming back here. Anna. Hi, Dad. What, uh... What are you doing here? I was in Sydney for a conference. Just a spur of the moment thing. Well, it's good to see you. Who's this? Ah! You're Gracie, aren't you? She's my girl. Would you like something to eat? No, thanks. Gee, you sound like a Pom. Oh, I didn't... Didn't mean it... No, that's fine. It's been a long time. Yeah. Do you mind if I stay here? Oh, no. Yes, of course. You don't have to ask. Cuppa? You're still racing your birds. Yeah, yeah. Got two champions there. I retired from the force, you know. I bought the pub off Deb Russell. You remember her, don't you? Used to be a Grayson. - Oh, oh, yeah, I think I remember her. I was going to write and tell you, but... Uh, you going to see your mother while you're here? Maybe. Uh, can you get your own cuppa, love? I've got to get to the pub and open up. Sure. Why don't you come down later and have tea there? - Your mum's car's still in the garage if you need wheels. Great, thanks. Come on, Gracie. I'll see you later, then. Hey, Barb. Did you get my toastie? Contract's come through. But we've got to deliver by the end of next week. That's cutting it a bit fine. Not his problem, Barb. Anna Macy's back. What? Just saw her up at the roadhouse. Did you talk to her? Hey? Uh, no, no. Chloe served her. Well, what'd she look like? Max? Max! What... What do you want me to say, Barb? She's probably just come back to visit Roy. Maybe I should warn Renae. She's going to get a shock. Don't start gossiping, Barb. Just leave your sister be. Roy? I wasn't expecting you. You look nice today, Renae. Is everything all right? Is Travis here? No, why? Is something wrong? You mind if I come in? No, of course not. Can I get you something, a cup of tea? Anna's back. Ah. I'm sorry. I didn't know she was coming. She just turned up. I wanted to tell you, before you saw her. Thanks. I'm happy for you, Roy. I really am. I really am. Anna? Where the bloody hell are you? I've been worried sick. I had to get out. I've had to cover your shifts. Is this about Molly? No, no, no. Well, you've really put me in the shit. I'm in Brighton, with a friend who's been ill. Brighton? I didn't know you had friends in Brighton. Are you all right? I'm fine. Anna, you need to get back here. Your job's on the line. Something has happened, hasn't it? What is it, Anna? I'll talk to you on Monday. I'll be back then. Hey. I have petrol and jumper leads, so we're right to go. ♪ Crimson and clover This song reminds me of my mother. ♪ When she comes walking over ♪ My mum calls this place the Hotel California. You can't leave, even if you do check out. You really think you can't get out of here? I know I can't. That's weird. I'm sure I left the car here. Did you take the keys? Might have been the Middleton boys. They're always nicking stuff. Shit. - Don't do that. Just for my photo collection. So, um, are you staying a while? Can't. I don't belong here. Not any more. Yeah, me either. What's that? A moth. Why a moth? Because they follow the light. I've seen them too, Anna. The lights, I've seen them, Anna. You'd be set if you knew where that kid was buried. It says she's missing, not dead. Out of here, Alfie, it's not a hotel. Fuck off. Senior Detective Brian Dutch. What can I help you with? I have to report a stolen car. Yeah? It'd be halfway to the mainland on the ferry by now. Would Fergus McFadden be here? You mean Senior Constable McFadden? I guess. Yeah. Dutch, what are you doing, mate? You know that button's for emergencies. Bullshit. Fergus. Man, how long has it been? A while. Aren't you cold? No, I... I don't feel the cold. Come on, your hands are freezing. These should do the trick. - I'm fine. - Try these on. No, go on. - No... - No, take them. - Thanks. I saw our initials are still in the counter. Oh, yeah. I still remember the bollocking your dad gave us. - Yeah. - Jesus, you're Anna Macy. You're that Anna Macy. I have to report a stolen car. Dutch. Hey, I'm sorry about him. - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, what make is it? Is it a white Corolla? Hire car? Yep. Yeah, I think I know who it belongs to. Good news. I found your car. Shit! That's my car! What the fuck, Jens? I thought we had a deal. No deal when you're trying to pull a swifty, Max. Get back, Max. Let us deal with this. Hold your men back. We don't need more trouble. What are you guys doing? He's on my car! Get off! Get off my fucking car! - Get up, you prick! - Adam, get out of it! - Come here. - Let me go! No, he's all right, as long as he keeps his arms to himself. - Bloody idiot! - See what happens when you get in bed with the fucking Greenies? Oh, shut it, Grayson! We're going to start logging those coups Monday, whatever it takes. If any of your sweet little back room deals stuff it up, it'll cost you. Don't threaten me, mate! I just did, dickhead. Once logged, forever lost! Once logged, forever lost! Once logged, forever lost! Once logged, forever lost! Once logged, forever lost! Once logged, forever lost! Once logged, forever lost! Once logged, forever lost! Once logged, forever lost! Once logged, forever lost! Once logged, forever lost! You know Mum reckons she did it? She calls her Mary Bell. Who's Mary Bell when she's home? Some girl in England who killed kids. No offence, Eliza, but your mum has a serious problem. She was here when Gillian Baxter disappeared, you weren't. Anna wasn't the only one who saw the lights that night. Not that UFO crap again. Look, if she didn't do it, then why did she leave? Why wouldn't you? She had the brains to get out of this hellhole. Just like I'm going to. Wish I could come with you. You'll never leave here, Lize. You'll be up the duff before you're 20. Will not. You ladies got a light? Sluts. He is such a turnip! Ah, you're going to get it one day. See you! Okay. Hey, Lofty, how's the beanie? Yeah, real good. Thanks, Chloe. I'll knit you another one soon. Love you, Lize. - Love you. - Love you! What does the bastard think he's doing? Oi, Macca. Don't worry about it, mate. Come on. You're all right. Thanks. Dad said you sold the pub. Had a bit much on my plate with the café, kids and all. Staying for the bun fight, then? Sorry? Your father's retirement bash, next Friday. Won't be as fancy as you're used to. No, I can't. Probably for the best. Back to work, miss. Hey, Adam... - Shit day? - Yeah, and getting worse. We got a leak. What do you mean? Bloody Greenies know every move we make, almost before we do. Someone's tipping them off. Why are they worried about Kettering Forest? It's not like it's old growth. - Any idea who it is? - No. But when I find out, I will bloody kill them. Everything all right, love? I'm going. Can I pay for this later? Hey, sure. No worries, love. Hey, Anna. Remember me? Max. Yeah, that's right. Long-time no see. I'm off. - Anna! You want to come to a party? Take me where you saw them, the lights. Okay. Is this where you've seen the lights? Not far from here. The old Sullivan house, do you know it? I think so. If I take you to them, you have to promise me you won't tell anyone. Stuff that I want to show you, but only you. Okay. I saved some for us. - Who's that? - Lize, my best friend. Her mum reckons that you killed Gillian Baxter. Do you think I did? Your sister's here. Knew she would be. Macca, shut the bloody door. Need to piss. Fucking hell. I got to go. Chloe will be home by now. Looks like Chloe's new best friend is here. Chloe can go and get fucked. You still love her. Piss off. Chloe. Wait. Chloe... Chloe! Gillian!
