 Gillian. Gillian. Keep it down, Anna. There are other patients here. Why are you doing this? We tested your blood. Your cells are changing. They're mirroring themselves. And you have brain lesions. I saw the book you keep your notes in. Your mother had fugue states, too.

 I know. There are others, too. The boy. Kade. I have to get out of here. I think I know who killed Chloe. Anna, you're hallucinating. The lesions are affecting your judgement about what is real and what is not. I've prescribed you some more Respiradine. I'm not taking it any more. Anna... I have to find out what's happening. Someone or... Something tried to kill me.

 They ran me off the road. What do you mean, something? Don't worry, you'll be safe here. Get some sleep. Eliza? Who's there? Eliza? Dane? Eliza! There's a hole here. You can get out. Dane, is that you? Come on, Eliza. Up here. Eliza! Come on. I've got you. I've been looking for you all night. What the hell is down there? I saw something. I think there are people down there. We gotta go. Come on, we gotta get out of here. What are you doing with a gun? Protection. Come on. The local Health Department have closed Shellac Oyster Farm just one day after the shutting down of the local mill. A spokesman for the Health Department refused to discuss how long the oyster farm would be closed, but there is no doubt it's going to hurt the local industry. All of this on the very day that locals are preparing to farewell Kettering teenager Chloe Holloway, who was tragically murdered a week ago. While police have been busy interviewing suspects... I want to stay with you. Don't worry. I'm going to fix everything. Come on, Lize. Ferry's about to leave. She's not here. What do you mean, she's not here? She managed to find her way out. You said she'd be secure. It's dangerous for her. She thinks you're hiding something from her. I think so, too. She deserves to know the truth, however bad that may be. Sleep well? No, not particularly. Good. You have a conscience, then. You didn't hear what she was saying. She thinks Jens is David Owen. Anna's no crazier than anyone else in this place. Is that all of them? There's about a half dozen still missing from the 85 reported stolen. Someone's gathering an army. Looks like it. They're burying Chloe today. It's about time. I've got Grayson in there waiting for us. Found an imprint on one of the threat letters. It's his signature. You are a man of mystery, Fergus, you know that? Do I need a lawyer? Depends. Did you write these letters to Max Holloway? Yes. I did. Did you kill Chloe Holloway? No, I did not. Well, these letters suggest otherwise. I was upset with Max. He'd been getting too friendly with the Greenies, so I wrote 'em to teach him a lesson. And then Chloe was killed. Took a lot of muscle to drag her body from the Ridge, then dump that dead weight out of the car at the mill. I didn't touch her. Chloe could be a pain in the arse, but she's a good kid. Max and Barb are friends, for Christ's sake. Eliza was Chloe's best friend. You were at the party. A few of us went up there. For what purpose? Just keeping an eye on them. By "them" you mean the environmentalists. Well, you can call them that if you like. Then you trashed their camp the next morning. They've ruined our fuckin' livelihoods! Pissed you off, didn't it, seeing Chloe up there at the party, thumbing it at her Dad, at you blokes? Don't. She's a kid. She's a stupid, rebellious kid. Was. Pardon? Was a stupid, rebellious kid. What time did you get home from the party? About midnight. Anyone verify that? - No. - If wives are good for anything, they're good for alibis. Sharon'd be too pissed even if we did live together. All right, we'll need to test DNA and fingerprints. Interview terminated at 9:15 a.m. You seen Travis Kingston lately? Travis Kingston? No, why? Just wondering. I'd get a good lawyer if I were you. Is that you, Adam? You don't need to do that. It's no trouble. They're pretty flowers. The water's still off. I'm thinking of moving on. Moving? There's nothing here for me any more. You said yourself Gillian's not coming back. Oh, Renae, I didn't mean that. I've probably been a fool waiting all this time. Travis filled a space, and now he's gone. Did it ever cross your mind, about Travis? What about him? The way he's taken off. You think Travis killed Chloe? Travis left because of me, not because he killed somebody. I know my grief drives people away. No one can understand the pain. Renae. It's Chloe's funeral today. Roy should have stood by you all those years ago. That's the truth of the matter. He had his faults. We all do. You think I don't know about you and Dutch? What are you talking about? Oh, God, Barb, it's obvious every time he walks into the pub. Everyone can see. Chloe knew. She told me. Barb, none of us are infallible. Not even you. But you're right, it isn't the time. It's Chloe's day today. I would have had all pink flowers for Gillian. She was always crazy mad for pink. - What are you doing here? - Where's Eliza? Is she here? Yeah, she's in her room. Craig? - Eliza. Eliza? What the hell are you doing? It's a moth tattoo, like Chloe's. What the hell? Is this Chloe's camera? How long have you had this? Eliza, where did you get it? I found it. Would somebody tell me what's going on? Found it where? Eliza, stop it! She's coming with me. Feels like there's a storm brewing, son. Yeah, Pop. I know. Dominic? Dominic? Oh, shit. Tell us where you found the camera, Eliza. I can't remember. Have you had it all this time? Maybe. I can't remember. Did you write those threatening letters to Max Holloway? - Fuck you. - Eliza. - Don't touch me. - Hey, hey, settle, Lize. Chloe made me. Made you what? Write the letters. Where'd you go after the party? - Home. - Can your mother verify that? She locked the house. I slept in the car. Eliza, do you know who killed Chloe? Dane reckons you did. Dane loved Chloe. He's emotional. She didn't deserve him. What do you mean by that? This is bullshit. Eliza, come on. - Come on. - Let go of me! - Hey, hey, Eliza, just relax. - Calm down. Hey! Calm down. Take her home. We want to talk to both of you later. You're all going to hell. Why did you let her go? Anything on there? Jesus. Not yet. I can bring Dane in for formal questioning. You're wasting your time. Yeah, because you threatened him. He was going to make a statement before you got to him. He lied about his alibi, just like you did. Chloe dumped him, so he's got motive. He's not capable of killing anyone. Neither is Eliza. What about you? What? You heard. I was fucking Barbara Holloway the night of Chloe's death. What? Ask her. We were in a motel. I'm not proud of it. You're fucking kidding me, aren't ya? Dutch. Okay. I gotta go. What's going on? Dominic's dead. Dominic? He was a scientist who was in Antarctica with David Owen. Who are they? They're the men that David Owen left behind. The guy whose fingerprint we found? - Anna, he's dead. - No, he's missing. He's not dead. It was the same thing 55 years earlier. A place called Dyatlov Pass in Russia. This same energy was in Alaska in 1967, Norway in 1991. That's more of Dominic's base. Travis. What? Where did you get these photos? Dominic left them for me. He must have known he was in trouble. He told me about a signal. He first heard it around the time Gillian disappeared. It came up from Antarctica and then he heard it here. What is it? I think it's got something to do with this sphere. What's this? I'm not sure but look at the pattern on the side. It's the same as the markings on Kade and Chloe, and Mum. Eliza has those markings. - Eliza? - Yeah, I saw them. Apparently I had them when I was young. I don't remember. Now I'm back and my blood's changing. Changing? How? I think it has something to do with all... ...my fugues. The humming sound. I've been investigating your father. He took money in 1998. I suspect it was from a biotech company, Amber Arrow. Toxic waste? Yeah. I mean, what if this thing, the sphere, came with it? The dates match. Chloe knew something, Dutch. She knew I didn't kill Gillian. You need to see this. - I found this in your car. - What? That's what killed Chloe. Anna? Someone's setting me up. Dad has a spare key. They're burying Chloe today. Your father will be there. Stay away. It's too dangerous. So when do the cops want to see her again? When she wakes, I s'pose. She couldn't have done this. Chloe was going to leave her. She had no one. She's got us. We weren't watching her, Sharon. Too busy watching ourselves. Lize. Liza, you awake? Hello? Who called it in? Anonymous. How'd you know him? Well, he... I used to talk to him about my father's disappearance. You know, theory of the tides. It's another mad thing that's happened since Anna showed up. Chloe, Wendy, the oysters. I mean, it's not even a mill town any more. That's just been sold to out-of-towners. Some group called Amber Arrow. Yeah. It's a .253 casing. From a stolen rifle, I reckon. Thanks. Forensics have called in the results on the paint chip and the tail light glass we found in the piggery. Belongs to a silver car, possibly a sedan. Hey, that could be Travis Kingston's other company car. Doesn't Eliza work for Travis? She does. Yeah, let's go check with Renae first. Make sure Eliza had access to the car that night. No one goes inside until Forensics get here. We've been waiting for you. Lofty? What are you doing here? I heard they put you in an asylum. My father did, yeah. Do you think you're mad? No. Not any more. I'm glad you came. I know who you are. You were a scientist, in Antarctica in 1998. I'm certainly no scientist. Police have a partial fingerprint belonging to a David Owen. - It's found on Chloe's belt. - Meaning? Meaning if they took your fingerprint, they'd have a match. I know you killed Chloe. - I didn't kill her. - You're a liar. She was already dead when I found her. I don't believe you. She was at the back of the old Sullivan house. I moved her body to protect people. What people? People like you and me. I traced Amber Arrow's chain of title. It's registered as a biotech company but it's origins fall off the radar as soon as you get to Denmark. So what conclusion have you come to? It's a front. Who are you working for? What are you doing with all this stuff? Why do you have thiopentone? This is Schedule 8. It's a hallucinogen. You can't administer this unless you're a doctor. That's why I'm glad you came. The lesions. You know, people tell me I was close to my father. We were inseparable. But I don't remember. I don't remember anything before that day in the forest. It's a traumatic time point. What about you, David? What do you remember? You used to care about people. Used to care about the environment. You were a husband. You had a son. Gillian. My name is Dr Colleen McKay. Wait. Wait. Wait, please! Who is she? An extraordinary woman. There's no scientific mind quite like hers. Let me speak to her, please. You could be like her, Anna. You could be an extraordinary doctor. I don't want that any more. - What do you want? - I wanna know who I am. - The truth? - Yes. You've seen it. The twin moons, shifting time... -...the seeds have dislocated everything. Seeds? You mean the spheres? What are they doing? They bring new life. A new order. And by you coming with me, it will tip the balance. We have a plan. We want you to be a part of it. Is that why you killed Dominic? 'Cause he worked out your plan? Dominic's dead? A bullet to the temple, but I think you know that already. No, but I know who killed him. Who? - They stole the rifles. - Who did? They're sick and contaminated. They don't understand that they're dangerous. There are others. How many? Dozens. Kade. We need you to help us. Why me? Because you're one of us, Anna. I need to speak to my father. Don't you want to know the truth? Because it's only the truth that's left now. Renae! Renae! Door's unlocked. Renae, you home? I'll check the garage. Right-o. Jesus. Bloody electricity, that'll be next. No water, no electricity. All ready for the concert? We've got a long drive. Thanks, Renae, for taking her. Are you sure? I mean, I'd take her myself, but... - All set? - Yep. Now don't forget to smile. Judges love a smile. She'll be fine. Come on. You can sit in the front with me. Fergus. The car's not in the garage. What's that? I saw this lipstick on Chloe's camera. It was sitting in the grass. It was the last photo taken that night. Oh, shit. What? It's the spare keys to the Jag. To Anna's car. By the time you have read this, I will be gone and what I leave behind is some of the pain that others have inflicted on me. To all the parents and their children. To those who have laughed at me... ...turned their back on me. Kettering Hotel, Deb speaking. Yeah, she was just here. She's taken Matilda to a concert. Why? I don't want you to look at me with pity. I want you to feel my pain. I just rang the organizers. There is no concert. I'll call it in. Deb, is there somewhere we can talk? Nobody knows what it's like to lose a child. The desperate helplessness, the aching loss. People look at you like you're contagious with some horrible disease they don't want to catch. But they don't really care. Now you'll know what it feels like. Chloe had to pay the price for you all. My precious Gillian was taken from me. Perhaps it was punishment for my sins, but who can say they live without sin? Anna, it's me. Please call me as soon as you get this message. I need to talk to you urgently. I'm sorry I let you down. I need you to come home. Er... I love you. I'm sorry, Barb. Max. - Hey, Macca. - Good day, guys. How are we? What the hell is that? What do you reckon that is? Buggered if I know. And that bloody noise. Oh, Adam, thank God you're here. Where have you been? Where have you been? Adam? One of our cars left about five minutes ago. Yeah, great. There's a sighting of a car matching Renae's up near Bothwell. They got three cars out there already. It's our job to wait here in case Renae shows up. I think Renae killed Chloe to get back at Anna. Let's let them bury their daughter before we tell 'em, okay? I'm going to go and pay my respects. Oh shit. Why are you here? Why aren't you looking for her? Well, Deb, we've got people looking for her. What's going on? Renae took her. - She took Matilda. - Took her? Where? Barb, Max, we need to talk. Let's go inside. Get your hands off my wife. Max. Max! You know who killed Chloe, don't you? Fergus? Tell her. It was Renae. What? I'm so sorry. No. - Fergus? - What? We need to go. Now. Roy? Someone's reported hearing gunshots coming from Mother Sullivan's Ridge. Jesus! Dutch! Dutch, come on, let's go! Anna! Anna, help me! We gather here today to celebrate the life of Chloe Holloway, who has returned to her home, with our Father in Heaven. The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the House of the Lord forever. Dutch! Dutch! I need blood. Okay. It's all right. Everything's going to be all right. I was wrong. Forgive me, Fergus. The King's Lomatia. Survived for 43,000 years against the odds. It survived and allowed us to live. We've reached a critical mass, a threshold. It's too late to save humankind. But we can change it. You didn't just come here to find out what happened to Gillian, Anna. You came here to find out what happened to you. You made the right decision, Anna. Who's there? Hello? Who's there? Gillian? What happened to you? Oh, my God.
