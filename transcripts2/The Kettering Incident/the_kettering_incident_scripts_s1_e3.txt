 Gale force winds and mountainous seas - smashed this boat into the rocks at Margate. Hello. Not even a mate. Well, find it. I'm sorry to have to ask, Max, but, uh... Can you tell me if this is Chloe's phone? Fergus? - What is it? - Um... Well, I don't know, mate. I'm not sure. What is it?

 Why is it all smashed up? Where'd you find it? It was found in Kettering Forest. About a K from the greenie camp. So, you'll start searching today. - Oh, my God. Chloe... - Hang on, Barbara, for Christ's sake. I'm gonna call Roy. Roy retired, Max. I'm in charge of the search. Adam, did you see Chloe at the party? You said you didn't see her. They found her phone. What does that mean?

 It means that we've got somewhere to start. How do you take it? What? How do you take your coffee? - What are you doing here? - I work here. Fergus is the only one with a decent coffee machine. Have you seen him this morning? Yeah, he was glowing. Glowing? It's amazing what exercise will do for you. Do you do it? Kayak. Exercise. Only caution. You were with Chloe. Mmm-hmm. What'd you talk about? Talked about London. She wants to get out. Escape. Escape what? I'd say people like you. Why me? Women usually wanna escape men like you. Self-preservation. You know, they found Chloe Holloway's phone? That's a nasty bruise. It's on the back of your leg. I already told Auntie Barbara last night. It was a joke. Eliza, get on with it. It's me. They're here. The lights are here. They're coming for me. Somebody's here. What do you want? Stay away from me! Who are you? Somebody help me! Is that it? Why did you say the message was real, and then five minutes later, turn around and say it was a joke? I was just mucking around. Where were you when you recorded the message? We were in Chloe's car in town. Drinking. Eliza, you know that it's an offence to lie to the police, don't you? You terrified Max and Barb. It didn't sound like a joke to them. What are you doing? I can see the lights. See? We just pretend. Chloe and I always do that stuff. You know... Just muck around. Guess I just wanted to be a part of it. Thought you might want a lift to work. Ah, I'm all right. Dane. Where are the drugs? I went round to Chloe's. Her mum wouldn't leave me alone. - They're in her drawer. - Which drawer? One at the bottom of her bed. Who's there, boy? It's all right, Pop, I'll be in in a sec. I never wanted to run the drugs... I'm not a fucking idiot, Dane. You owe me 10 grand. Chloe shouldn't be dealing in the first place. But I don't care who took 'em. - I want my money. Dane. You were with me... Friday night. Franklin Shed. Okay? - Why? - Because of the storm. Is that an alibi? Dad? Now, news just in... The police organized a search party in Kettering Forest for missing teenager, Chloe Holloway, who failed to return home after attending a party in the forest on Friday night. Police have not issued a statement as yet, but a source tells us that a mobile phone believed to belong to the teenager was found not far from the camp in the early hours of this morning. Late yesterday, a protest turned violent when... Deb. Do you know where the search base is? Can I get a lift up the mountain, please? All the cars are full. They're looking up at the Kettering Forest, aren't they? Same as with Gillian. You saw the lights, Renae, didn't you? Why don't you keep your mouth shut? I want to find her, too. I can help. I think it's better for everybody if you just stayed here. Watch your back, Deb. Christ's sake. Do you mind if we turn the heater down? People think I had something to do with Chloe's disappearance, don't they? Why did you come back? I'm trying to work that out. Shit! Mum, what's she doing here? I couldn't stop her. Put a jacket on. Who'd you kill? What are you even doing here? You gotta wear these. Thanks. Yeah, the dogs have arrived. We're about to run them down the ridge. Chloe! I said come here. What's the problem? I've never seen 'em act like this before. What the hell is up there? Chloe. Chloe! Chloe. Chloe. Chloe. Gillian? Shit! Gillian! Don't move. You're just stuck, Anna. Come on. I can manage. Okay, fine. Every search she's done, they can track it. We'll assess everything. Emails, social media. Check the hard drive. I need a piece of clothing. Something she wears all the time. Yeah. Okay, well, just let me know how it goes. Bye. You'll find her, won't you? Stop. Stop. Find my daughter. Here, just watch your step. Hey, Deb. Can you grab a blanket? What happened? What did she do? She didn't do anything. Dad. What's up there? Just go home, Anna. Come on. She was calling out for Gillian. Roy. We tried to run the dogs up the ridge. It's private property. I know that, Roy. We need to search all relevant areas. Anyway, they wouldn't bloody go in. The trainers said they'd never seen anything like it. It's a bit premature, isn't it? You need to let me run this my way, Roy. The weather's closing in. Did you hear what I said? We've all got to pull together. This is not the time for egos. It's not about egos, Roy. It's about how you've retired, and I need to oversee this. I've been a cop for 35 years. We need to find her. That's what I'm trying to do. How long have you been having chemo? Who told you I had cancer? I saw the chemo implant on your chest. I'd appreciate you not speaking about my business. No one knows. Who's treating you? Dr McKenzie found me a specialist. Dr McKenzie? Do you still see her? No. She works at the old Women's Prison as a tour guide. The convict prison? She does the occasional shift at a pathologist's. Wanted to get out. You know, if you ever want to fit in around here, I suggest you change your attitude. It sucks. Why are we stopping? We can't even see a hand in front of us, mate. Come on, Adam. All right. Here you go. Coming down? I don't need your help. I don't know why your mob were even allowed up here. Fuck off back to the blockade. Go bang some fuckin' drums. We're here to find your sister. What are you doing? Just doing a few rows. I don't think Chloe would want you doing her knitting. You didn't find her? Where's your father? I don't know. You heading home? Yeah, soon. We've called the lads in for the night. We'll start up again at first light. You want a beer? No, thanks. I've got to get home. Maybe you should go home, too. How are you holding up? All right. Good man. Hey, Fergus tried to run the dogs through Mother Sullivan's. They wouldn't go in. Baulked. What'd he do that for? I don't know. Trying to be the big man, I think. It'll be all right. - Yeah. - Go home to Barbara, mate. You know, she never wanted to come here, Roy. It's been a constant disappointment to her. Ah, the joys, eh? Go home. Uh, it's pretty clear that as a result of the response to last week's blog that people all around the world feel that political, social and natural cataclysms are happening at an increasing rate. And that has them heading towards the question... Shit. They didn't find her? Not yet. Renae called everyone in Hobart. No one's seen her. What time did you finish up? Roy told me they're gonna start again at first light. No one could survive out there in this weather. She'll be in Hobart, Barb. She has to be. How many of you were up there? I don't know. What do you mean? I was at the mill. - She's your daughter! Barb. I'll fix it. Here. Thank you. Here you go. Thanks. Who can say what evil truly is, until we experience it first-hand? This was his private dissection room. They did have another dissection room over at the hospital, but this was hidden in the depths of the prison. The doctor here was fascinated with the brains of his female patients. He'd lay 'em out here. If a convict was near death, or it was just a matter of time, they were made to bring her across here, place her in a hammock in the other room, and then they'd wait. The surgeon would get other convicts to hold the lantern, while he dissected the cadaver. Nine times out of 10, they knew the woman that was being cut apart. Anna. Hi. If you hadn't have called, I wouldn't have recognised you. Come on, I've gotta close up. How's your father? He just retired. He must love having you back. You two were so close. I can't remember being close to him. You were like his shadow. And my mum? I liked your mother a lot. It was hard for her. What was? Coming from the mainland. She was isolated. Kids used to call her a witch. Well, that doesn't surprise me. People are so bloody small-minded. I wondered if you knew about that day. The day Gillian went. I knew that's why you called. That you'd come back. I want to know. When they brought you in, I hardly recognised you as the same little girl. Who brought me in? Roy, of course. Someone had cleaned you up. There was a lot of blood under your fingernails. Whose blood? I'm not sure. Roy got you out of there before I could examine you properly. Next thing I know, Lofty's arrested. Why did you leave Kettering? Because I wasn't allowed to be a good doctor. What do you mean? Things started happening. I thought at first possibly an allergy had taken hold. But then, strange cancers. I mean, it's a small town, but there were so many cancers. Gut, spleen, things you don't normally see. Like Deb Russell. Yes, exactly. I wanted toxicity tests done. You know, on the water and the soil. They labelled me a nutter. And then the threats started. Threats? So I left. What did the pathology tests say? Please, I have to know. Anna, I saw Chloe Holloway on the news. She had nosebleeds. Blackouts. Did she come and see you? Go back to London. Bottle of Shiraz, takeaway, and a whisky, double. Sure. Hey. Did you put me to bed last night? Yeah. You were in a pretty bad way. Thanks. You didn't find her? No. Not yet. Where are all the old case files kept? Have they been digitized? What are you talking about? I want to see Gillian's file. Well... It'd be in Hobart, at Archives. Can you call them for me? No. - Can I use your security pass? - No, you can't. Bloody hell. Chloe's gone missing and you're worrying about something that happened 15 years ago. This is a community, Anna. Where people care about each other. I know that. Good. Then try acting like you do. Same again, Bec. Buy you a drink? I'm tired. You don't look tired. How would you know? It's a strange coincidence, all this happening when you get back. Thank you. Funny thing is... I don't believe in coincidences. What's a homicide cop doing on a missing person case? Give it a couple of days. We'll have a body. We both have a pretty good idea how this will end. Don't forget your wine. ...spreading half truths in key markets like Japan, but the Greens say the move is an attack on free speech. You know, it doesn't do you any good trawling through this. Maybe there is a sign. What sort of sign? The lights. Why have they come back? Not a fucking movie, Renae, all right? There's no fucking close encounter. Gillian's not coming back, all right? She's not... She's not gonna be like some fucking, magic Christmas fairy miraculously appear. You know, most children who go missing are dead after three days. That's a fact. She's dead, Renae. That's the truth, all right? I'm trying to help you. Help me? You're a simple, close-minded bastard, you know that? A leech. - You bitch! - Ah! - Anna. - Hi. This is very thoughtful. Is Barbara around? She's, um... She's getting ready for bed. It's... Been a really big day. I'm really sorry, Max. Well, we just have to hope for the best. I thought you were talking to Eliza. Can I, um... Can I get you something, Anna? I just wondered, did Chloe have any noticeable marks on her skin? Why are you asking that? I saw Dr McKenzie today. Um... She had eczema as a baby. How about nosebleeds? What's wrong with you? Get her out of here. Get out. - Barb. - Please. Yeah? - Goodnight, love. - Goodnight. Chloe's got jammies like that, I think. These are hers. Okay. Sleep tight. Night. You'd tell us if you knew where she was, wouldn't you, Lize? I miss her too, Uncle Max. Renae. Renae, it's Dutch. Travis? I'm all right, love. I'm just getting ready for bed. A neighbour called. Can you show me what he did? You can come with me right now and make a statement. I'll drive you to the hospital. He's under a lot of pressure. It'll settle. My mum thought the same thing every Friday night. Don't tell Roy. Please. Travis isn't Gillian's father. Is he? No. Who called? Someone heard screaming. They don't have to live with her going on about aliens and shit. You want a beer? No thanks. Don't know why you come round here all high and mighty. What you think you're gonna achieve? Patronizing me, you fucking hypocrite. What are you on about, Travis? See, I know what you're up to. - Do you? - Yeah, your little enterprise. I've seen the boats. I know you're dealing. I saw Chloe, so you take yourself right... - Prick! Hey? You touch Renae again, and I'll fuckin' kill you. You feel better? Oh, shit. Do you want a drink? No. This won't change anything. I know. Turn around. Jeez, you're bleeding. Hey. Your nose is bleeding. Here. Sit down. I'll find you a towel. Here. Was she here? What? Who? This is Chloe's. She was wearing it the first time I saw her. I remember it. I picked up some stuff from her mother's. It's for work. That's bullshit. Were you having sex with her? It's part of the investigation. What, fucking 17-year-olds? My father's a cop. Evidence isn't lying around his house. You would be surprised. She was 17. Why are you using the past tense? You're a liar. Why did you come back? It's my home. You don't have a home. ♪ Ah ♪ When she comes walking over ♪ Now I've been waiting to show her ♪ Crimson and clover ♪ Over and over Gillian, you have to go home now. Anna has homework. No, I don't. What are you doing? Nothing. What is this? It's Gillian and I. Barbara has lost her child. And you go waltzing down there with your far-out theories. I took them some wine. They are decent people. What does that mean? Max said you were talking about Dr McKenzie. - I asked her. - What? What did you ask her? I wanted to know about Gillian. Why would you ask about that? - You know what happened. - No, no, I don't know. Yes, you do. When are you leaving? I'm not. Who cleaned me up? I had blood on me, didn't I? When you found me in the forest. Are you drunk? You're drunk, aren't you? Why don't you go back to your job in London? I resigned. Was it Gillian's blood? I don't know whose blood it was! You talk about decency. You can't speak to me like this. Why did you have an affair with Renae when you had me and Mum? You make me sick. Why can't you just tell me the truth? Truth? You have no idea. You're the only one that knows what happened. You! You alone! You know what happened. And it's all in here. I don't want you here. Anna?
