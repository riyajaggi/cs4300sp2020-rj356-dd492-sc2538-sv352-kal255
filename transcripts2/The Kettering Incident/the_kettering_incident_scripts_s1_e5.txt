 [Gracie growls] Hey. [Gracie growls] What's wrong, eh? What's wrong? - [Softly] What's wrong with you? - [Gracie snarls] [Whirring] [Woman over PA indistinctly talking] - MAN: Everything's all right. - [Beep] [Speaking indistinctly] Here she is. Our Madonna of the Holy Hands. Hello, Adam. How are you feeling? Didn't expect to see you here. You've lost a lot of blood. And your cell count is low. May I have a look? - Could you give us a moment, please? - He can stay. [Beep] - Can you feel it when I touch here? - Yep. - How about here? - Yeah. - Are you in any pain? - Nope. Good. Well, rest up. I'm glad you're feeling okay. I'll leave you both to it. [Phone ringing] I left a blood sample here to be tested yesterday. The patient's name is Fisher. Kade Fisher. Sorry, nothing was logged yesterday. Check again. [Sighs] [Tense music] Sorry, there's no record of that sample at all. Transcribed & synced by kinglouisxx & zjoox Proofing: PetaG for addic7ed.com [Sighs] Thanks for covering for me, Deb. Bloody Gracie bit me. Your patrons will start biting you soon as well. You only took this place off me 30 days ago. Already you've turned it into a Slim Dusty song. Bugger. Forgot to order the beer. [Groans] - Are you okay? - [Sighs] Yeah... Yeah. Have you spoken to Singlet and Matilda yet? I'm not ready. They're gonna know something's not right. I'm not ready. [Sighs] - What does the oncologist say? - I get my next results in a week. Same as the others. Pig still thinks it's a conspiracy. What's a conspiracy? The fact that six of us got cancer at the same time. Singlet's thinking about moving to the mainland. The mill won't be open for a while. Rumour has it, it may not open again. We don't know that. Why don't you talk to him, Deb? I'm sure he'll stay if he knows. What's the word on Chloe, it's just that's everyone's asking. I'm out of the loop. - [Phone ringing] - ANNA: Tim, I'm sending you a picture. Looks like some kind of bite, maybe. It's too symmetrical to be a rash. I've seen identical markings on two people now. Skin colouring of both patients makes me think haemochromatosis, but I just don't know. I'm sending them through. If you could run your eye over it, Tim. I'd really appreciate it. And say hi to Molly for me. What are you doing here? Call me when you get this message? What did the pathologist say about the markings on Chloe's body? He said it was police business. Secret world of police. Yeah, well, you'd know all about that. - Are you implying something? - Me? Nuh. Now, Roy managed to put you through Madame Posh boarding school. Got your mum all comfy in a nice facility and now he's snaffling up the Kettering pub. All on a copper's pension plan. You should talk to Lofty Sullivan. 10 months in remand, all on the gospel word of your old man. Kettering Incident time. It's all in his files if he hasn't conveniently lost them. [Phone ringing] Hello? [Dog barking] Tried calling your father but he isn't answering. Dr Patrick's on his way in. You'd better steel yourself. [Flies buzzing] We can't risk giving her any more midazolam. What dose have you given her? - 20 milligrams over the previous hour. - 20 milligrams? That's enough to drop a camel. Mum, it's Anna. [Eerie music] How about we put you to bed? [Footsteps approaching] So, what have we got here? Hello, Wendy. I hear you've been causing a bit of a ruckus. Not sure why Bridey felt it was necessary to drag you all the way in. Nothing we can't handle. Okay, exactly, when have you seen an encumbered woman burst to life after 15 years from a vegetative state? The brain is a constant mystery. Can I see her CAT scans? There's nothing to see in the scans. Just a couple of minor white meta lesions... Angular gyrus in parietal lobe. How did you know? [Intriguing music] MAN ON RADIO: That was "Crimson and Clover". Originally recorded by Tommy James & the Shondells. You will need your wellies tomorrow. It's going to be another chilly one... - [Radio changes tunes itself] - Delta, Tango, Juliet. Is there any known traffic below 5000? - [Static] - Please, I cannot identify. Right now, it's orbiting, it's just orbiting. On top of me.. It's got a green light and some sort of metallic... It's an old kind of aircraft... - Oh, Deb, where do you want these? - Hi, Sharon. Just on the shelf. - How's Eliza? - Getting more like a Grayson every day. - No offence. - None taken. - [Strains] - I mean how is she coping? It's hard to tell with Lize, you know. A bit like her father there. What the hell is that? [Eerie music] How the bloody hell did that get here? It's moss. Bloody forest is creepin' in. [Birds twittering] [Geiger counter crackling] Twenty thirty... [Mumbling] Yeah, honey... You're sure the shed was locked up tight - the night of the storm? - Yep. And there was no one in there on Friday night. Absolutely no one in there. Right-o, thanks. [Dog barking] Hello? - Fergus, are you there? - _ [Shaking pills in bottle as she walks] [Shakes pills] [Dogs howling] [Filing drawer clunks opens] Fergus? Does he know you're doing that? I'm just looking for something for Dad. For his big night. Fergus isn't here. Yeah, I'm not looking for him. What do you want? You. What happened? Dogs. Is there a wild pack out there or something? Nope. Their own pets. What, they just attacked them? They'll need tetanus shots. I'm waiting for a real doctor thanks, Sandy. It's fine. If you find yourself craving water, your muscles lock up and you start fitting, feel free to give Sandy a call. Any news about what happened to Chloe? No. Not yet. [Birds twittering] [Eerie music] [Warbling sound] [Car door opens, closes] - [Dogs barking] - Hey, Billy. Dane around? No. Been out all night. - Does he normally stay out that long? - Never. He doesn't like to leave me alone. Did he come home on Friday night? After the storm. Yeah, I think so. It was late, though. He was at a party. Here. Let me help you with that. Nah. No, no, no, no. I can... I can take it. I can manage. - All right. Well, thanks Billy. - Yup. I'll have a look around. There's something not quite right around here, Fergus. - [Dogs continue barking] - Why do you say that? It's the lights. They always bring trouble. [Dogs barking, howling] You can see here, the indentation on the head, - neck and lower spine. - Mm-hm. Weapon? Some kind of angled iron. Maybe a part of a machine or... - Supposedly, you don't know. - No, I don't. At least the parents can get on with burying their daughter. Not quite. She was carrying toxic substances in her blood, and an abnormal level of radiation in her body. How? There's nothing down there. Something's given her a blast. She was carrying 430 millisieverts in her body. It didn't contribute to her death but we will have to hold on to the body. Do more tests. More agony for her parents. - What's this? - Well, stuck to her clothes. Oh, that's a King's Lomatia. It's on the endangered list. Only grows in certain areas. It's unusual because the plants are genetically identical. It clones itself. Well, aren't you a revelation. What sort of certain areas? Dense old growth gullies. - Like where? - Up near Mother Sullivan's Ridge. - Can I take this? - Sure, I've got more samples. [Woman over PA indistinctly speaking] - Sorry, I was late back. - Kayak peak hour, was it? Look, be careful what you say in there. Let's keep it pretty simple and loose for now. Barb was asking about Chloe's cardigan. - What cardigan? - She thought you took it. For the dogs. Afraid not, mate. They're doin' tough. By the way... Dane's alibi? Doesn't check out. Max, Barb... Adam, how are you, mate? Have you heard any more? Can I bury Chloe, please? I'm afraid they're still doing tests. Toxicology came back with a few anomalies. Do either of you know if Chloe's been in any contact with radiation? Radiation? What are you talking about? Is that what killed her? No. [Sighs] It seems... that she took a blow to the head. - We're not sure of the weapon yet. - [Barb sobbing] - I'm so sorry. - Someone murdered her? [Barb sighs] DUTCH: We'll begin a thorough investigation, starting with everyone at the party. - Including everyone in Grayson's Ute. - MAX: Grayson? - We have to talk to everybody, Max. - Who've you got on your list? We can't disclose that information, sorry. If we can ask you to please keep this to yourselves. We don't wanna frighten anyone off. Okay? Adam? Okay? [Barb sobbing loudly] Will you leave us, please? [Barb sobbing] [Nostalgic music] [Sobbing] [Door closes] So, Dane's alibi doesn't check out, hey? - Says who? - Grounds and Mo said the boat shed was locked up tight that night because of the storm. - Why'd you talk to them? - Just followin' up. If I want you to follow up with something, hey... I'll ask ya. Right up and to that point... you speak to no one unless I say so? Okay? Yeah, okay. - Anna Macy? - Yes. I'm Dominic Harrold. Have you got a moment? What do you want? Well, I was hoping I might be able to talk to you about the incident, here in Kettering. - Sorry, who are you? - Well, I'm a geophysicist, ahhh... 18 months prior to the Kettering Incident I was working in Antarctica and, uh... - Could I buy you a coffee? - [Eerie music] - I don't like to discuss it. - Please, hear me out. Whilst I was there, I detected unusual bursts of electromagnetic radiation. That's the aurora, solar storms. We pinpointed the source, it was coming from deep, deep beneath the ice. What's this got to do with me? I'm getting the same readings here in Kettering. - I don't think I can help you. - I think it's got something to do with what happened to Gillian Baxter. - I'm sorry, I can't help you. - Do you... hear a loud humming, Anna? Feel a vibration, a... a sensation that cuts deep to your bones. [Wind blowing] Leave me alone. [Bird chirping] [Tense music plays] [Dogs barking] [Car door closes] [Dogs barking] [Phone ringing] [Phone rings, then stops] [Humming sound] Your photo keeps popping up on Chloe's computer. - Well, I had nothing to do with her. - Pretty prominent. - You had something going with her. - I didn't touch her. All right, she was coming onto me, not the other way around. [Scoffs] Still sorting things out with Sandy. Did you mention to Chloe that you'd done time for rape? It wasn't rape. All right, I got done doing a 15 year-old that looked 20. And me doing time is exactly why I didn't go near her. [Scoffs] - Still tryin' to clean up. - Sure you are. You were up at the party on Friday night. - With me mates. - You left the Ute. Can't a guy take a piss without being charged for murder these days? Depends on whether we find your fingerprints and DNA on her. Fergus here'll give you a swab. Interview stopped at 3:08 pm. Get out. Leave Sandy alone. What, you wanna get charged with threatening police, do ya? _ You got some love competition there. Shut it. "She then claims to have seen an orange van "and a thickset man standing nearby. "She couldn't remember what happened to the other girl, "but managed to give the name of the man she saw as Lewis "Lofty" Sullivan." - [Camera shutter clicks] - [Rumbling] "The witness said temperatures plummeted "and a blinding light emanated from the forest above the ridge, "followed by a strange humming sound." [Rumbling] - [Tinkling music] - [Rumbling] "Dr McKenzie recommended psychiatric care..." [Indistinct chatter] What? Adam just called. The cops reckon Chloe was murdered. Maybe we should call this off. Wouldn't help. Place needs a distraction. - Be good for the town. - [Scoffs] I think that's what Max and Barb would want. There's been a tragedy here at the mill and work's been suspended. I dunno, another week maybe? Jesus Christ, there's bloody moss growing everywhere. Uh, nothin'. Yeah, look, I'll talk to the bank, see what I can do. No, appreciate it. Yeah. Right-o. Thanks. - [Hand brake is applied] - [Car door opens] [Car door closes] You killed my daughter. Admit it, you fuckin' arsehole! Sit down, you crazy bastard! You were at the party. Eliza said so. - Jesus Christ. - [Both grunting] - Fuckin' hell. - Are you fuckin' insane? You were makin' threats about Chloe for weeks! You're in shock, mate. But you're barkin' up the wrong tree! Somebody killed my baby girl! Why would they do that? Look, if I find out who it is, I'll kill him with me bare hands. But I swear, Max, I had nothin' to do with it. All right? You gotta pull yourself together, Max. [Laboured breathing] Huh. They reckoned she had toxins in her blood. That could be anything. [Pouring drink] You said someone bashed her. What if was she up at the ridge? Why would she be up there? It's locked up. It's locked up, isn't it, Max? - I let Jens go up there. - Oh, boy. He studies wedge-tailed eagle's nests or something. You let the fuckin' greenies in? It was a deal I did with him, so we could log Kettering Forest. But he double-crossed me. [Gulps] We go down, this whole place goes down. Oh, look mate, I don't give a toss about my reputation or this bloody town. I just wanna know who killed my little girl. We need a strategy. We need to have a position when that ridge is crawling with forensics and they start finding shit. We deny all knowledge. They start dragging stuff up, we just say it was there when we bought the joint. Okay? Are we agreed? Max?! [Softly] Yeah. Yeah. What the hell did we bury up there anyway? [Eerie music] [Birds twittering and insects buzzing] Lofty? Hello, Miss. You're at the wrong wharf for the ferry. I'm Anna Macy. I know who you are. Go away, leave me alone. Please. - Lofty, please... - I'm gonna be late for work. I'm not here to make any trouble. I just need some help tryin' to remember things. I never hurt you. I never hurt her. You said I hurt you. Did I say that? - I don't remember... - They put me in jail. Can you tell me exactly what happened that night, please? Found you at Mother Sullivan's. I picked you up. Carried you for miles. ANNA: I wasn't at Mother Sullivan's. I couldn't have got up there. LOFTY: ...at my grandmother's house. ANNA: The old Sullivan House. MAN: ♪ Hush little baby, don't say a word ♪ YOUNG ANNA: Dad! MAN: ♪ Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪ YOUNG ANNA: There were lights. MAN: ♪ And if that mockingbird don't sing ♪ YOUNG ANNA: Bright lights. ♪ Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring ♪ Why did he blame you? He was scared. Scared? Of who? Of you. [Brooding music] [Eerie music] _ [Tense music] [Branches crunching, rustling] [Dog barks] [Coughs and sniffs] [Sniffs] - Oh! - [Mud pool splashes] Fuck ya. [Urgent music] [Birds chirping] Ah! [Rustling] Who's there?! [Crickets chirping] [Dog howls] [Dog barks] [Door creaks] [Door closes] [Light switch clicks] BILLY: You all right, mate? Yeah. Thanks, Pop. [Fluttering] - Hey. - Hey. - You right? - Hm-mm. Yeah, I reckon Sando's dog needs to be put on a lead. He had a go at me. I reckon all the dogs in Kettering need to be on a leads. Something's rattling 'em. I'll have a word to Sando. Travis really liked her. Chloe. - Oh yeah? - He was pretty keen. And he used to like follow her and all. How do you mean? Kind of, leave the office whenever she walked by. You know, like text her all the time and stuff. Did she... like him? - He's real old. - Right, well... Doesn't really prove anything but thanks. No. No, not saying it was... He kind of, uh... He kind of raped me. Not really like rape, you know, just a couple of times. What... what are... what are you talkin' about, Lize? When... when did this happen? It was a long time ago. But you know, like, he gave me a job. There's not much work about it. So, worked out. Don't tell Dad, will you. Please. [Chuckles] You know, I don't want it getting out. I mean, Dad'd kill him... and me. Uh... Lize? Eliza just told me that Travis raped her. Bring him in. What do you think these are? Green night vision goggles. Army issued, probably. Put 'em on. DUTCH: What do you see? FERGUS: Green Dutch... Green office. Why? What's all this about? What are army goggles doin' at Mother Sullivan's Ridge? [Seagulls squawking] [Suspenseful music] TRAVIS: Chloe Holloway? Who told you that? You were seen following Chloe on a number of occasions. - Why would I? - Were you stalking her? If this is all coming from Eliza Grayson, I will fucking... FERGUS: What? What'll you do? Sack her. 'Cause she's a lying bitch. It's her you should be investigating. Look, I wanna have a talk to your boss. Don't have a boss. Yeah, you do. [Sniffs] I just want a quick word. We can sort this thing out in a minute. Or we'll sit here for a couple of hours while I get my lawyer. Right. [Door opens] Wait there. [Door creaks closed] Let me handle this. He might have a perfectly logical explanation. Perhaps he was in the boat shed with Dane. [Door opens] [Door creaks closed] Did you do it? Nope. I bloody didn't. See, you've got nothing on me. But I've got a fucking avalanche to bring down on you if this goes on for one moment longer. - Are you threatening me? - You fucking bet I am. FERGUS: He's lying. He's covering for someone or something. If Chloe was involved, or... - knew about the drugs. - You gotta be 100% certain before you start blowing whistles. I doubt if he's the one that killed her and if he did, he'd hide it better. So why cover for Dane Sullivan? And now Travis? And why would you bother lying about a bloody cardigan? Look, here comes the first lot. They'll circle for Bute, they'll find the direction, then head home. He's now convinced the murder took place in Mother Sullivan's. Can't work out whether he's trying to solve it... or cover it up. [Background chatter] Oh, you've gotta be kiddin' me. Well, it's okay. Just a question. I'm not pointin' a finger at anyone. And this conversation never happened, right? But did any of you blokes know anything about... Travis Kingston and Grayson's daughter? Eliza? Just works for 'im. So, no word of him, you know... not usin' her... sexually against her will? You're fuckin' kidding me. - He raped Eliza? - No, uh... maybe not. I'm just looking in at all angles on the murder. What, did he kill Chloe? No, he appears to have an alibi and... that's all you need to get off a charge these days. Sometimes I wish I wasn't a bloody cop. DUTCH: Now, um... have a good day, guys. [Glass thuds] [Brooding music] [Drawer opens] [Drawer closes] [Brooding music] [Locker shuts, items clattering] [Intriguing music] [Glasses clink] Why did you leave Gillian Baxter in the forest that night? Beg your pardon? Because that's what everyone wants to know. DEB: Why? - I was upset. - About? I was only gonna leave her there for an hour. What? [Glasses clink] TRAVIS: I didn't fucking do it! No. No! No! - I didn't fucking do it! - Hold him. - Come on! - I swear on my mumma's grave. I fucking never touched her. [Breathes heavily] - [Macca spits] - No. Please! [Sobs] Please! Please! Please! Argh! [Mouths fuck] [Lock rattles] DUTCH: How's our town publican? Ready for your big send-off? Feel like a bit of a wake, does it? ROY: How can I help you? I was wondering what you can tell me about Gillian Baxter's father? Why don't you ask Renae? That's her business. I think it's your business too, Roy. You see, I've been doin' some thinkin'... I keep wonderin' about your decision to send Anna away all that time ago. You weren't even here, Dutch. Why're you bringin' that up now? Because another girl went missing recently. In fact... She went missin' the same day your daughter came home. The very day. And it made me wonder... why a sweet little girl might kill another. I think jealousy might be the answer. Girls don't like sharing their fathers. You don't know what you're talkin' about. This town worships you, Roy. You're their local hero. Be terrible for your... shiny and carefully managed reputation if this got out... wouldn't it? Especially on a night like tonight. - What do ya want? - Call off your dog. He is beginning to cause me considerable pain. Fergus doesn't answer to me. I'm not a cop any more. He hangs on your every word. I want nothin' more than to catch Chloe's killer. But if your boy decides to bring a shitstorm down on me, I am taking no prisoners. [Birds cawing] [Sighs] [Keypad ticking] [Phone signal] VOICE MAIL: Travis. Not here. Leave a message. [Beep] Travis, this is my fourth call. Where are you? [Sighs] [Phone ringing] Travis? [Sniffles] - [Crackling sound] - Hello? Mummy? Mummy? [Sighs] [Slowly sighs] [Inhales and exhales sharply] [Chirping] [Eerie music] Hello? Hello?! [Clattering] - [Rumbling] - [Growling] Anyone there?! - [Ominous whaling] - [Banging] - [Gasping] - [Ominous whaling becomes rhythmic] - [Indistinct eerie whispers] - [Ominous whaling] - [Indistinct eerie whispers] - [Ominous whaling] - [Indistinct eerie whispers] - [Ominous whaling echoes] ANNA: You're all dressed up, ready for your glory night? [Door closes] Anna. What're you doing? How long was I in an asylum? About ten days. You were in a terrible state. You were having these, er... episodes. And they were just checking that - you were not... - Insane? Why can't I remember any of this? Because I told you, - you were in the hospital for... - Pneumonia. And the drugs they were giving me? Were to sedate you. And they worked and they let you out. - This is not the right time for this. - When is there a right time? Why did you send Lofty to prison? Because he was there with you. He was there with you when I found you... - covered in blood. - ANNA: He saved me. And you threw him in prison. Why, Dad? - Why did you lie? - You said you saw a man in an orange van in the forest. Lofty had an orange van. He's mentally deficient, Anna. He used to stalk you and Gillian. You've put words in my mouth I couldn't possibly have said. There's not a word of truth in here, is there? And yet you ignored other witnesses. - Why? - Because you ran out of this house, screaming blue murder when you found out Gillian was your sister! And then you disappeared with her for over eight hours! - Not eight hours, that's wrong. - Yes! Eight, long, terrible, bloody hours. And when I did find you, you were in the old Sullivan's House babbling about fucking UFOs and God knows what. You were covered in blood. And when I tried to wipe the blood off you, I realised it wasn't your blood. For God's sake, Anna, I was trying to protect you. You must know that. You arrested him to cover for me. You were a different girl when you came back. You were wild, crazy almost. - You think I killed Gillian? - It was like... [Roy quivering] [Quivering quietly] Oh. It was all my fault. All this time? - You think I killed Gillian? - I wasn't gonna lose both of you! [Gentle music] [Muted music begins] You better get to your celebration, Dad.

He's runnin' drugs. Now the Assistant Commissioner is gonna be there tonight. I'm gonna talk to him privately, after the event. No. You won't. You haven't got enough on him.

Ladies and gents, if you'd like to just, ah, top up your drinks, um... we'll be back in a minute. _ Hey, mate, where have you been? I didn't expect you to come. - We need to talk to you. - Later. Let's get this out of the way first. Alrighty, uh... bit of shush, thanks folks, Ah, we all know why we're gathered here tonight... Ah, we're here to pay tribute to one of the district's finest... Roy Macy. [Applause, cheering] Now first up, we have Deb Russell to say a few words. DEB: When I left The Hill... Roy came to my place and he sat down and he said, "Deb... "I'm not leaving until I know you're okay" What are you doing here? - DEB: Everyday... - I could ask you the same question. [Applause] What are they? [Sighs] Um... Just an old pair of goggles I found up at the ridge. What were you doing up there? Looking for a crime scene. [Rustling sound] [Rumbling sound] - What's wrong? - Nothing. You think that's were Chloe was killed? Maybe. [Melancholy music] [Sighs] No weapon, no vehicle, no crime scene. And just this... little crimson flower to go on. It clones itself, according to Fergus. You should speak to Jens. He was telling me about a flower like this. So why aren't you at your father's celebration? I'd say the same reason as you. [Eerie music] Next person I'd like to welcome up onto the stage is our very special guest for the night, and that is... none other than the Assistant Commissioner for Police, Mr Brendan Trengrove. [Applause] Thanks a lot, thank you. You know, the Force really needs your average cop. The sort of cop that's entwined in the life of the community. Men and women in the Force who make themselves integral to the lives of the people in their district. That not only enforce the laws of the land, but involve themselves with the local footy team. Fight the fires, - drive the tractor at fetes. - [Grunts] To be a country cop, you need to be a friend. A confidant and a counsellor. - A mentor. - [Alarm bells ringing] Everyone depends on ya. And that decent, honest cop is the man standing here... Sergeant, or should I say, former-Sergeant, Roy Macy. You not only have the Force's thanks, mate, you have the thanks of your town. - Well done. - [Applause, cheering] Roy! [Applause continues] ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ - ♪ And so say all of us ♪ - [Static noises] - CRAIG: Hip, hip! - ALL: Hooray! - CRAIG: Hip, hip! - ALL: Hooray! - CRAIG: Hip, hip! - ALL: Hooray! [Applause, cheering] [Static noises continue] [Shattering] - [Phone rings] - Hello? Doctor Macy? - It's Doctor Polly Sutton here. - Yes? I'm calling about a blood sample you dropped off for your patient Kade Fisher. [Polly Inhales] This blood has more anisocytosis than I've ever seen before. With hugely variable cell morphology. It... [Sighs] it does not appear to be human blood. Hello? Are you there, Dr Macy? Dr Macy?
