 Anyone that was at that party in the forest needs to come in for an interview. Do it willingly. Do it quickly. Adam. Adam, Adam, don't. - Adam! - Hey, hey, hey! Where is she? My sister? Tell me! She's gone, mate. She was last seen up at the party.

 But why would she go to the mill? That's what we're trying to ascertain. There's no sign of her vehicle. Right. We'll be keeping you informed as much as we can, as anything relevant comes to hand. We're going to need to interview you again, and Adam as well. Yeah, of course. Of course. Eliza. Time you went home. We won't let you down, Max. Okay? I promise you.

 If there is someone responsible, we'll catch the bastard. For fuck's sake, Fergus. It's not an official homicide yet, and you go making promises to the victim's family. Well, someone knows something. She didn't just end up there on her own. What if we never find out who that was, huh? What if we do and it's even worse? It's their son, Adam? Adam? Why would Adam murder his sister? Or Max did it. Bashed her head in. You'd enjoy telling Barbara that? I'll do what I have to do. Mate, the girl's dead. It's too late to be the hero. Okay, let's start with making a list of everyone that was at the party. Loggers, greenies, locals. I know some of them have priors. Macca for starters, and there's a few other blokes around here with history. Who, Lofty? Isn't he Roy's number one patsy? Did you inherit that with this job? Roy was just doing his job, okay? And so am I. Hey! You're Chloe's mate, aren't you? Yeah. You knew her better than anyone. She was my best friend. Who was her worst? I don't know. She was fighting with that Anna woman at the party. Fighting? - What, physically fighting? Yeah. I already told you all that. She's weird, I reckon. Yeah, well, she has her fans. Come on, jump in. We'll give you a lift. No, I'm all right. In an already volatile situation between the loggers and the greenies... Hey, Pop. The body of missing teenager, Chloe Holloway, has been found at a local sawmill. Police have refused to comment on the cause of death at this stage, but they've asked anyone with information to come forward. The teenager was last seen at around 11:00 p.m. at a party up at Kettering Forest... Dane? Coming. While there has been no speculation of foul play, some questions still remain on how the teenager managed to get to the forest... Dane! Is that your Chloe they're talking about? Get in. Interview with Miss Anna Macy, commencing at 9:45 a.m., Tuesday the 11th of August with Senior Constable Fergus McFadden and Senior Detective Brian Dutch. Can you tell us when you last saw Chloe Holloway? At the party in the forest. We drove up there together. Chloe wanted to stop off. She had packets on her. Packets of what? Drugs. You saw them? She had packets in the car. - I think it was ecstasy. - How did you know it was ecstasy? She was saving up to leave town. I think she was selling for someone. It would help us if you answered the question, Miss Macy. How did you know it was ecstasy? Doctor. I didn't. I just assumed. Did Chloe say who she was selling for? - No, she didn't say. - Look. You were seen down the wharf at 3:15 in the morning, walking your dog. - It's my father's dog. - Why would you do that? I had jet-lag. I needed a walk. What time did you leave the party? - I think it was around 12:00. - How'd you get home? I walked. - That's a long walk. - Bit of a blur, really. - What do you mean by "blur"? - As I said, I was jet-lagged. - What time did you get home? - I didn't check the time. How did Chloe seem when you left her? Seem? What was her state of mind? She was intoxicated. Remind me. You took the dog for a walk. What time did you get home from the walk? - Around 4:00. - You checked what time you got home from walking the dog? - Yes. - Why was that? - I wanted to keep track. - Of what? Time. Anna? Excuse me. Jesus, Fergus, sort that out, will ya? Fergus, I've been trying to call you. Roy, what do you think you're doing? You know you can't just barge into the interview room. - Why is Anna in there? - We're just doing our job, okay? We have to talk to everyone who was at the party. Well, she needs a lawyer in there with her. No one's been accused. No one's been arrested, all right? I want her out of there. She hasn't requested a lawyer, Roy. Senior Constable Fergus McFadden has re-entered the room. It's 9:51. I hardly knew Chloe Holloway. She was a baby when I left. Is that before Roy smuggled you off the island? He didn't smuggle me anywhere. - Well, maybe you can explain what happened. - I don't know. Can you tell us what you and Chloe were fighting about at the party? There was no fight. There are witnesses who say the opposite. - They saw an altercation. - They're lying. What about you and Gillian Baxter? The girl who went missing 15 years ago? You're half-sisters, right? Anna and Gillian? No, that's not true. Of course it's true. Isn't it? I don't see what this has got to do with Chloe. I think it has everything to do with it. Anna, wait. You just said in the interview that you left the party at 12:00 and a few days ago, you told me you got home at 11:00. Eleven or 12:00. What's the difference? What's the difference? It's a big bloody difference. Can I stay with you? I can't stay with Dad. Is it true? That you and Gillian were sisters? Roy never said anything. No one said anything. Guess it wasn't something he was very proud of, Fergus. - Where are you going? - I don't know. Why didn't you tell me you were down at the wharf? Do you tell me everything you do? I need to know, Anna. Wait. Thank you. It'll only be for a night or two. You know the funny thing? The only person who actually wanted me to stay in Kettering was Chloe. Hey, Lofty. Hey. Chloe would be really happy that you were wearing the beanie. Do you want a drink, Lize? No, I'm all right. Hi, Mum. ...searching since Friday, with echoes of the disappearance of Gillian Baxter 15 years ago. The body of the girl, 17-year-old Chloe Holloway, - was found this morning at the local mill. - No, Roy. The cause of death is unknown at this stage, and locals are being urged that if they have any information to contact police. Renae. You should go home. I've got to go see Barb. I should be with my sister. Hey, Sharon. Craig. Thanks. How you going? How do you think? Yeah. So what brings you into town? Protecting my daughter. You're never around. That'd be a first, wouldn't it? - Mum... - Don't tell me what to do. Why don't you go sit with your father? Hey, Dane. How're you holding up, mate? All right. You got a minute for a quick chat? I'm really busy. How long had Chloe been dealing drugs for? I got to work. Okay, look, I'm sure that Deb wouldn't mind if you took a couple of hours off to come down to the station to make a formal statement. But, you know, that might make you look like a suspect, so it's up to you. I don't know how long for. Oh, fuck. Not long. - She got some stuff from Hobart. - What stuff? Ecstasy. Who'd she get it from? We broke up. She hardly spoke to me. Were you angry about that? Why would I be? I dropped her. Did she ever mention... Did she ever mention being scared of anyone, or? No. Where'd you go? After the party the other night? Dutch asked me to help him secure his boat, because of the storm. What, down at Franklin Shed? - Where the old blokes play poker? - Yeah. Ask him. He'll tell ya. Thanks. Come on. Do you good. Hey. Come on, darl. Various bruises and cuts to both sides of the body. Broken collar bone, broken foot. Slight burns to the face. And there's discolouration, which could indicate poisoning or drugs. Organic matter under the nails, in the hair, which at this point appears to be forest foliage. She was moved. Or she moved herself. I can't say until after the autopsy. I would estimate the time of death to be somewhere around 3:00 a.m. And the cause of death? Couldn't say that either, definitively. There's blunt force to the head, obviously trauma. I'll need to run a full toxicology. What about the marks? Never seen anything like it. Adam. Adam! Look, mate, the police said this morning that they want to interview all of us, including you. - Why me? - Well, you know why, mate. You were up at that party with your mates. So? Do... Do you want a hug? No. Look, your mum and I have been thinking, and we think that your sister would have wanted... Your sister would have... So, work's stopped, then? Ah, yes, for the moment. Well, how bloody long? Well, I don't know, mate. Your greenie mates will be rapt. Fuckers got exactly what they wanted. You're home early. I'm still in shock. Can't believe what happened. I saw her and... Hi. Fergus gave me a key. He lets me take a shower here, after work, sometimes. - Right. - Easier than going all the way home. He's not here. Are you staying here? No. Just for a while. On the couch. Can get to you when you know 'em. Have you got any hobbies? You've got to have something in this job, or it'll kill ya. Me, I'm going to be a winemaker when I grow up. And if that doesn't work out, I can always be a piss-head cop like me old man. Last at the party at 11:00, dead at 3:00. I don't think she fell. I mean, Jesus, did you see the size of those logs? How did she get under there? How did you know? About Anna and Gillian being sisters? - Figured it out. - Bullshit. Is that why you've got it in for Roy Macy? What? What, 'cause he screwed around on his wife? Why would I give a shit about that? Well, what then? I've got my reasons. So it's payback. I call it karma. Dad. Hey. Lize, I'm sorry I lost my temper with your Mum. She just frustrates me, you know? Dad, I was wondering if I could come and live with you. At yours. It's just with Chloe gone, it's... Lize, I just... I just think you're better off staying put. You know, I've got Mum and Dad to look after, and I'm going to be out a lot. And this bloody thing's thrown everyone for six. I understand, Dad. Take care, Lize. I didn't even know that she was going to that party. You can't keep track of them all the time. That'll happen, you know. You'll beat yourself up. Drive you crazy. People. People you hardly know, they'll come around. They love it. Like vampires feeding at the grief. What are you talking about? The injustice. What injustice? I don't need you to try and make this better, to try and make me feel better. There's nothing to sort out, there's nothing to try and get through. There's nothing. There's just... Shit. I used to look at you and think that that was the worst thing. The not knowing. - It is. -No, it's not. I've got nothing now. Nothing. At least you've still got hope. ♪ Over and over Anna has homework. No I don't. Gillian, go. It's fine, I'll go. Why don't you like her? It's her mother I don't like. Why? I like Renae. I told you before, Anna, I don't want her in my house. If Renae had any decency, she'd leave town. Gillian is my best friend. I don't want her in my house! Mum, can you open the door? Get the fuck out of here! Go on! I know you want to live with your father, so go on! Go off to the Graysons if you love them so much! Go! I don't want you here! Aren't you going to answer it? Where'd you find the bed? The garage. Sandra came over. She used her key. What happened to Chloe? Sandra? Do you know how she died? I can't discuss any of this with you. Is Sandra still here? No. She just helped me pump it up. She knew the first thing to do but her ex-husband, Macca, used to take her camping. Jesus, don't judge me, okay? You know what this place is like. We're trying to keep it quiet. Can you please just tell me what happened to Chloe? If I did know, I wouldn't tell you, and I don't. Would you like a beer? Jesus, Anna! For fuck's sake, I could lose my job. I've seen those before, those markings. I saw them on a boy in the clinic. She didn't die from a rash, okay? How did she die? I'm going to bed. I'm sorry, Fergus. Fergus? Anna, can you go to bed, please? What the fuck? Sandra. The boy the other day with the marks on his skin. What's his address? We're not going there again, are we? Chloe Holloway. She had the same markings. - The same? - Yes. It's vital that I see him. I need to get a blood sample. I'm not supposed to give out addresses. There's lots of things that aren't supposed to happen here, Sandra, but they do. You're not going to take him away? No, I promise you. I'm a doctor. I want to help your son. Nothing I can do about Kade. Got my hands full as it is. I think we should take a blood sample just to be sure. What? Like a needle? Yes. How did Kade get those marks? The rash? I don't know. Told him not to go out at night, but he doesn't listen to me. It's not my fault. Said he didn't even know he'd left the house. Do you sometimes wake up and you don't know where you are? And lots of time's gone past? Kade, when you wake up, are you always in the same place? Go on, tell her. Mo-fo's. Mother Sullivan's Ridge. It's where those fuckin' lights are. See, it's just a prick, like I said. They're looking for you, you know. The coroner believes that Chloe's death was probably caused by trauma. Trauma? An impact to the head. Oh, God. Oh, no. So it was murder? I don't think we should jump to any conclusions. The coroner says there was evidence of skin discolouration. - Was she ill at all? - No, she wasn't ill. She was fine. And what about her mood? Did she seem depressed, or low on the night of the party? I didn't see her. They're going to cut her open, aren't they? Barb, the autopsy has to be a part of the process. I promise you, they're taking care of her. I want to see my daughter. I want to see my baby. You don't want to see her like this. You really don't. Can you think of anyone, anyone that may have wished Chloe harm? No. Did she mention anything? Think back. Any arguments? Words she may have had with someone? She had a big mouth, like me, but no one hated her. You know what she was like. How about you two? Any altercations? - Anyone threaten you? - Yeah. Every bloody greenie who stepped foot in the forest. - Why aren't you talking to them? Max. I, erm... I got some letters. What letters? What'd they say, Max? They were just bullshit. - What'd they say? - I don't know. Just stupid things. Were they threatening? Well, no different to the usual. Why didn't you say anything? How many have you had? I've had five since March. Wait. "Leave the forest alone or justice will cut you down. "The truth will raze you. "And all you care about will tumble and fall with you. "You cannot hide. "You cannot run. "The forest knows what you have done. "You have fucked up "and your family will pay for your sinister crimes in the forest." Fuck! Like some sort of metallic... It's not an aircraft. It's not... This is Delta Tango Juliet. Do you know what kind of aircraft I've got here? Military aircraft! Oh, shit! Fuck! ♪ Over and over Argh! Fuck! Jesus Christ! Adam, can you hear me? Lift your hand. Let me see. Okay, I'm stemming the blood flow. Do you understand, Adam? You're doing really well, Adam. Really, really well. I think someone's here. Did you see him? That's good. One more time. Adam, we have to get you to a hospital, okay? Okay? Okay, let's try. Come on. That's it. One, two, three. Adam. Adam. Adam. Come on, come on. Adam! Help. Help me! Help! Help! Help! What were you doing out there? Just make sure he's strapped in. Did you see anything back there? Only what you saw. I'll be back. This is Adam. He's in hypovolemic shock secondary to femoral artery laceration from a chainsaw. Okay, one, two! I've controlled external haemorrhage with direct pressure. Stay with us, mate. You'll be all right. He's lucky. Maybe there's a reason you came back after all. Thank you. I'm so sorry. Why did you ask if Chloe had nose bleeds? No reason. Because I found some blood on her pillow cases a few times, and I just... I just thought she'd cut herself. No one teaches you how to be a good mother. I just thought I'd have more time. What have we done, Max? Why are we being punished like this? Max. Max. My boy. - Roy! Roy! Roy! Jesus, Max, calm down. Somebody knows. Nobody knows. My family was threatened and now my daughter's dead. Come on, come inside. It must be someone who knows what's up there. What we've done. No one knows. Grayson does. I think it's him. You have a visitor. Look, Wendy. Your daughter's here. Your mother hasn't moved in years. Unfortunately, she can't see or hear you. Hi, Mum. It's me. It's Anna. I'm back. I thought I'd come and see you. Where did you get this? I didn't make this. Can you hear me at all, Mum? Look at your hair. It's a bit of a mess, isn't it? Hello? Anna! Mum?
