 Anna?
 Anna?
 - Help me.
- Don't move.
 Anna?
 Anna? Are you okay?
 - Hey, can you hear us?
- Anna. Anna.
 Help me.
 Gillian.
 Anna. Please, we don't
have time for this.
 I'm thirsty.
 How did your fingerprints
get in the piggery?
 I touched the railing.
 - You said you didn't go in there.
- I said I didn't touch anything.
 I forgot about the railing.
 There were moths... everywhere...
 - they follow the light.
- What were you doing
 at the old Sullivan house?
 It was my mother.
 I think she called for me.
 Interview terminated at 11:34 AM.
 She can go?
 Yes. On the condition
that she stays with you.
 - We'll need to talk to her again.
- Okay.
 I'm worried about her, Roy.
 She seems to be...
 I don't know,
hallucinating or something.
 She's just lost her mother.
 I know. And I'm sorry.
 Are you aware that she
takes antipsychotic drugs?
 Sandra told me.
 Sandra should mind her
own bloody business.
 You may have a problem with me Fergus,
 but don't take it out on Anna.
 She's meant to be your friend.
 She isn't the Anna that I used to know.
 You must be hungry.
 I could make you a chicken sandwich.
 No, thank you.
 Um...
 I know it must be hard to...
 losing your mother when
you... when you just found her.
 Perhaps you need to see someone.
 Sometimes we die because we die.
 Well, the police said
you have to stay here.
 Come on, Gracie.
 This is Fiona McKenzie,
 please leave a brief
message after the beep.
 Some water is being contaminated.
 It's just a precautionary measure.
 We're testing everyone in
town, in the next day or so.
 That's all we need.
 Hey.
 Constable.
 Dr Maitland.
 We need to cut off the
water supply to the town.
 - Can you alert people?
- Yeah, sure. I'll get onto it.
 We're getting some pretty
heavy readings here.
 Where does the, uh, main
water supply come in from?
 The catchment, up behind the ridge.
 Right. Okay. I'll need to access it.
 Good luck with that.
 My old man owns half, and
I can't bloody get up there.
 You'll need to talk to Craig
Grayson or Max Holloway.
 Right.
 Okay, fellas...
 it's with a very, very heavy
heart I need to inform you that...
 as of next Friday, the
mill will be shut down.
 - Oh!
- That sucks.
 - New owners will be takin' over
- Fuck you!
 in the next few weeks.
 I just wanna say that, uh, I
tried as hard as I could to prolong
 this decision, but as you all know,
we couldn't fulfil the contract.
 - Yeah, and whose fault's that?
- Yeah!
 And as a result, Jack Steadman just
had no choice but to shut us down.
 Bullshit! What is gonna happen to us?
 You're gonna be paid out
until the end of next month.
 - Yeah, and then what?
- Look, I'm sorry!
 I did my best.
 - It's not good enough!
- Hey.
 - Whose fuckin' side are you on?
- Come on.
 - It is not fuckin' good enough, Max!
- Listen, we're all in the same boat,
 I got a million bucks tied
up in equipment out there.
 Bloody hell!
 Adam, what are you doin'
out of the hospital?
 I wanna work.
 Well, there's no work, mate,
the... the mill's closed down.
 What are you talkin' about?
 The mill shut down, mate.
 - Oh.
- Hey, take it easy, Adam.
 - Hey, ugh!
- Adam, hey!
 Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy
with 'im, he's hurt. He's hurt!
 - Calm down!
- Adam! Adam!
 - Come on, mate!
- Adam, just calm down!
 Hey... hey, just... just
stay here, mate, just...
 Don't go anywhere, mate, just stay.
 This is Fiona McKenzie,
 please leave a brief
message after the beep.
 It's Anna, Macy.
 Can you call me back please?
I need to speak to you.
 You can let Lofty out.
 Results of the blood came in and,
 they match seal blood,
just like he said.
 That's a pity, I thought
we could wrap this up.
 Who've we got left?
 I'm still intrigued by Anna's claim
that Chloe was scared of someone.
 Right, let's narrow down some facts.
 Who hasn't got an alibi?
 Travis Kingston. Still missing.
 Have they got back to us about
the paint flakes and the glass?
 No, still being analysed.
 We're waiting on the
results of two tyre prints
 but they both belong to a smaller car.
 We've got a partial fingerprint here.
 Who else has no alibi after 11:00 PM?
 Craig Grayson,
 Adam Holloway, Macca, Singlet.
 They were all up at the party.
 Along with Dane.
 I told you Dane was with me.
 And Macca does have an
alibi as it turns out.
 - Oh, yeah? Who?
- Sandra.
 She came in here this morning.
Statement's there on your desk.
 Seems he went there after the party.
 Oh, women,
 they're fickle, aren't they?
 - You're an expert, are ya?
- I've had my share.
 The only other fingerprint,
 matches a bloke who
presumably died in 1998.
 Nice one.
 Keep up the good work, Fergus.
 Adam?
 What are you doing here, sweetheart?
 What is it?
 You shouldn't be walking,
sweetheart. You should be...
 Why aren't you in the hospital?
 Adam?
 What is it?
 Your free bed and breakfast ends today.
 Off you go, Lofty.
 Go and save a seal.
 Thank you for the food.
 It was lovely.
 I'll let Fergus know, he
made it especially for you.
 If we say we have no sin,
 we deceive ourselves,
 and the truth is not in us.
 Book of John, chapter 1, verse 8.
 Come on, Dane. You can't back
out of it now, we've got him!
 You don't know what he's like.
 He'll twist it.
 I do know what he's like, and he's
not gonna be able to twist anything.
 All right, mate? All you
have to do is tell the truth!
 That you and Chloe were
pickin' up the drugs for him.
 He'll get me like he got Chloe.
 All right.
 I'll have you summonsed.
 Nobody heard me say anythin' here.
 I'll deny everythin'.
 Shit! Fuck! Fuck!
 Argh!
 Dr McKenzie?
 Fiona?
 Wendy Macy, sample 6.
 The cell count looks low,
 the system's compromised.
 I suspect the enzyme is altering the
internal machinery at the T cells.
 Sweetheart,
 you still need treatment.
 I wanna work.
 What the hell is that?
 Leave me alone!
 You all need to leave me alone!
 The strangest thing is...
 many of Wendy's cells now seem altered,
 and appear almost like
 mirror images of each other.
 She seems to have been exposed
to a pathogen of unknown origin.
 And this is... what killed her.
 It's not like anyone's gonna miss us.
 Chloe was right to
want to get out of here.
 Chloe got herself killed.
 You shouldn't touch her stuff.
 Auntie Barb said I could have it.
 I bet she didn't.
 There's nothing for us here.
 I can't leave my Pop.
 He's blind.
 Reckon he can see more than you can.
 We don't have any
money, where would we go?
 We could do a couple
more runs for Dutch.
 - How did you know about that?
- Chloe told me.
 She told me everything.
 Stay away from Dutch.
 He's dangerous.
 What, do you reckon he killed her?
 He'll never leave you alone,
you know that, don't you?
 And he'll hunt you
down and kill you too.
 Hey, I reckon I know where
Chloe might've hidden some money.
 State Health Authority.
 - Craig Grayson?
- Yeah.
 We need to take a team of people
up to Mother Sullivan's Ridge.
 First light tomorrow.
 How did you do this?
 Being a dick.
 - You're good at that.
- Aren't I just.
 You're lucky it's not broken.
 I'm sorry I hurt you, Sandra.
 Will you come over for dinner,
let me make it up to you?
 I don't know what time
I'll be finished up here.
 I'll wait.
 Thought you didn't
like hanging after 8:00?
 I'll make an exception.
 That's big of you.
 - Shit!
- Don't move.
 Hey, were you with Macca after
the party the other night?
 It-it's just because...
it gives him an alibi.
 Really?
 You came here to ask
me if I was with Macca?
 No. I wanted to say I'm sorry.
 I care about you.
 - No, you don't, Fergus.
- Look...
 Can we talk about this over dinner?
 - I have to go.
- Come on, Fergus.
 - Sandra?
- I'll think about it.
 God's country, this island.
 Do you believe in God?
 No.
 My old man said faith
was a sign of weakness.
 Somethin' to cling onto
when all else fails.
 Maybe he was right.
 My old man's always right.
 That's his religion.
 What's with your hand?
 Was she worth it?
 Wasn't about a girl.
 You should direct your anger
where it belongs, Fergus.
 Oh, yeah? Where is that, Dutch?
 At yourself.
 You're just so disappointed in yourself.
 - You're so full of shit, you know that?
- Truth hurts, eh?
 Truth? What the fuck
would you know about truth?
 You never wanted to be a cop, did ya?
You're just doin' what Roy Macy wanted.
 Feel obliged to him for taking
over when your old man drowned.
 Get out.
 - Dane told me your alibi was false.
- Dane wouldn't know what day it was.
 He said that you put him up to it.
 He's terrified,
 - he thinks that you killed Chloe.
- Why would I do that?
 You were using her and
Dane to bring in drugs.
 Which was cleared by
head office, by the way.
 I know your old man has influence.
 Dane chickened out.
 He was scared of what
you might do to him.
 If you wanna be a good cop, Fergus,
 don't take idiots at face value.
 I will keep going until I prove it.
 Prove what?
 Now, I wanna find Chloe's
killer as much as you do.
 And some bastard's out
there getting away with it
 because you and I are here fart-arsing
around taking swipes at each other.
 We need to pull together.
 I'm not gonna stop, Dutch.
 Come on.
 - Seriously?
- Great.
 Come on!
 - Try it again.
- I'm trying.
 What the fuck?
 There's nothing there.
 Aaahh!
 - What the fuck was that?
- I don't know.
 Try the engine again.
 Hey, Renae.
 - Is Travis here?
- Nah.
 How come he left his car?
 Um, sorry I can't offer
you tea, the water's off.
 Have you...
 heard from him at all, Renae?
 S'pose the whole town's laughing at me.
 There's nothing funny
about a girl being murdered.
 He didn't kill Chloe.
 Did he come home after
the party that night?
 Renae...
 d'you mind if we look around?
 Sure.
 I couldn't find anything in the car.
 He must've left in a hurry.
 D'you find anything?
 No, mate.
 Seems like a bloke on the run.
 _
 Sorry, I'm late.
 This is all I could get this time.
 Dinner's ready, Barb.
 I feel like it's all coming to an end.
 Hey, boys.
 Sorry to hear about the mill.
 Bit of a blow for this town.
 Understatement of the decade.
 Buy you a beer?
 - Yeah.
- Yeah.
 Three beers, thanks, Deb.
 Yeah, I've been meaning
to ask you both...
 whatever happened to Travis Kingston?
 Haven't seen him in days.
 Really?
 He'll be back by now.
 Oh, yeah. What'd you do to him?
 Let's just say, uh...
 he won't be hasslin' Lize any time soon.
 Who won't be hassling
Lize any time soon?
 No one, Mum.
 Ooh!
 Stop it!
 [Dutch whimpers and grunts
 Stay away from me!
 Dutch, you okay?
 - Huh?
- Dutch?
 - What are you doing here?
- The door was open.
 Drink?
 ...minimum of 12° and showers today.
 There's no question people are
doing it tough down here lately.
 - The switchboard's been jammed all
- _
 - day with concerned locals.
- _
 Let's hear for a few more.
Evelyn? Are you there?
 Hi. My husband just lost
his job at the mill today.
 It's been his life.
 What's he gonna do now?
What are we gonna do?
 I've already lost two
sons to the mainland
 'cause of the work situation here.
 I can hear the hurt
in your voice, Evelyn.
 A lot of people share
that feeling today.
 Senior Constable Fergus McFadden.
 Rifles? Where?
 Okay, yeah... H-how-how many?
 All right mate, okay. Yep
I'll... I'll come round in a sec.
 All right, mate. Just...
Yeah, I'll see you soon.
 ...on the phone. He's an
 expert on toxic waste.
 Maybe he can shed a light on what
is going on up there on the ridge.
 I'm sick, Dutch.
 I think I might be dying.
 Uh...
 Oh!
 I dreamt I was at
Mother Sullivan's Ridge.
 - You know those goggles I showed you...
- Mm-hm.
 I can't stop thinking about
it since I put them on.
 What are they, Anna?
 - Have you seen them before?
- What did you see?
 I dunno.
 Maybe it was just trees.
 There's a boy, lives near the ridge...
 He has the same markings Chloe had.
 She spent a lot of time up
there, at the old Sullivan house.
 What, you think the
marking's come from the ridge?
 The inspectors think the toxic
waste is coming from there.
 I need your help.
 I didn't kill Chloe, Dutch.
 There must be other evidence.
Other fingerprints apart from mine.
 There's a partial fingerprint.
It must have been a misread.
 It's a scientist who
was in Antarctica in '98.
 - Why did you have his fingerprint?
- Mistake, it happens.
 It was on the underside of Chloe's belt.
 But why was he on record
in the first place?
 Security clearance for Antarctica.
 What was his name?
 Uh, David...
 Owen. David Owen. Something like that.
 Barb?
 Barb, where are ya?
 Barb...
 Jesus.
 Barb? Barb!
 Bring 'em up, Barb. Bring them up.
 Argh... uh.
 Please, love...
 Oh... I wasn't there for her, Max.
 I wasn't there...
 Don't leave me, Barb.
 Chloe wouldn't want that.
 Shh.
 We're okay.
 We're gonna be okay.
 You're gonna have to get another job.
 I need more for rent.
 D'ya hear me?
 Yes, Mum.
 Nothin's free in this world, Eliza.
 When're you leaving, son?
 I'm not.
 Don't lie to me, Dane.
 I've uh... I've got a
few savings you can have.
 Nah, I'm all right. I've got
some saved from the café.
 Do you good to get away from here.
 I'll come back.
 Not if you're smart, you won't.
 The scientist from Antarctica,
you told me about...
 - Do you have a photograph of him?
- What's this about?
 Is there any chance he
could still be alive?
 No. Impossible.
 Do you have a photo?
 Wait here, Anna.
 Can't say I remember what he looked
like. He wasn't a part of my group.
 David Owen.
 He's amongst that lot somewhere.
 I'm not sure you want to see these, but
 this was what was left of the camp.
 Christ!
 There is... no chance...
 that he could be alive.
 Similar incident occurred in Russia.
 Place called Dyatlov Pass.
 They were found half naked in the snow.
 Whatever it was,
caught them by surprise.
 They never found David Owen.
 I managed to get these shots after
the place had been cordoned off.
 Of course the whole thing was hushed up.
 When I started asking questions,
 they shut me down and they
sent me back to the UK.
 Why do you ask?
 His fingerprints were identified
on Chloe Holloway's body.
 Are you positive?
 The police think it's a mistake.
 Well, it must be.
 He couldn't have got out of there alone,
 there wasn't another
ship for six months.
 Can I keep these?
 You can have the group shot.
 Thank you.
 Be careful, Anna.
 Come on! Let's do this!
 They're gonna be crawlin' all
over this place in the mornin'.
 I think it's all over, mate.
 It's never gonna be over.
 Shit!
 What the bloody hell is it?
 It must have bubbled up from the storm.
 It's everywhere.
 Roy said it was low grade.
 So why's everyone in
town droppin' like flies?
 What's that noise?
 Must be the transmission tower.
 Bloody loud enough.
 What're we gonna do?
 Dump a ton of soil on it
and bury it once and for all.
 _
 Fuck!
 Jesus fuckin' Christ!
 Oh, Christ, it's Travis.
 You lied to me.
 Roy, it's not safe for you to be here.
 You said whatever we
buried up here was harmless.
 You knew it was more than toxic
waste when you took the money.
 - I took it to help the town.
- You did it to control the town.
 You wanted to be the hero, and then
it backfired. Now get out o' here.
 I'm not gonna let you take Anna.
 Corrupt to the very end, eh?
 - You've done enough damage.
- Anna can make her own decisions, Roy.
 - She's not capable.
- She's very strong.
 She's come back here for a reason.
 I've already lost a daughter.
 And a wife.
 I'm not gonna lose Anna too!
 So what are you gonna do,
Roy? You gonna shoot me?
 How's that gonna help?
 Please.
 Whatever deal we had...
has nothing to do with her.
 All of this...
 has caused nothing but chaos.
 And out of chaos comes change.
 I'll tell the people of this town what
you've been doing up here all this time.
 How you've been poisoning them.
 Don't you do anything stupid, Roy.
 You go back into town now.
 Huh.
 All right. Let's do it.
 Just get this over and done with.
 There's gotta be...
 C'mon, there's gotta be another way.
 Not that I can bloody see.
 Shit!
 - Right here.
- Now take 'im!
 This doesn't feel right.
 We can't take the risk.
 I have no intention of doing time.
 Especially not for a
piece of shit like him.
 What if he killed Chloe?
 You wanna go to jail for him?
 Shit.
 Fergus!
 That fingerprint you found,
I know who it belongs to.
 What fingerprint?
 David Owen! The
scientist from Antarctica.
 How do you know about that?
 - Anyway, that was a misprint.
- No, no, no, it wasn't.
 He's here. He's in Kettering.
 Anna, what the fuck
are you talking about?
 It's Jens! Jens is David Owen.
 I saw him dancing with Chloe.
 - Jens.
- Yes!
 And now he has Kade. Kade has some
kind of radiation poisoning. So do I.
 - Okay.
- He killed my mother, Fergus.
 Just wait here.
 We shouldn't be in here.
 It's a crime scene.
 We need the money.
 Close the door.
 She said it'd be under the floorboards.
 Eliza...
 this isn't...
 where Chloe...
 What the hell is that noise?
 Eliza!
 Anna...
 Fergus has told me everything.
 You need to come with us.
 - Let's go.
- Where?
 Just...
 just trust me.
 There's nothing here.
 - Ugh...
- There's some kind of room down there.
 Come on, let's go.
 I can't... uh... I can't go in there.
 What are you doing?
 Shh, there's someone outside.
 Liza, don't...!
 Liza...
 Liza!
 Fine.
 Why are we here?
 Is this about Mum?
 Yes.
 Hello?
 Hello?
 Hello?
 Hello?
 Dane?
 Dane?
 Hello?
 Hello?
 Is anyone there?
 Is anyone there?
 Somebody?
 Somebody?
 What's going on?
 You're not well, Anna.
 You need help.
 No. No!
 Fergus! Lies! Lies!
 Put her in ward six.
 Please. Please! Please!
 Please. Help me! Help me!
 I think I know who killed Chloe.
 Anna, you're hallucinating.
 The lesions are affecting your judgement
about what is real and what is not.
 _
 Anna is no crazier than
anyone else in this place.
 She deserves to know the truth,
 however bad that may be.
 _
 Who's there?
 Someone's gathering an army.
 Looks like it.
 Chloe knew something, Dutch.
She knew I didn't kill Gillian.
 - I found this in your car.
- What?
 Someone's setting me up.
 What the hell is that?
 Someone's reported hearing gunshots
coming from Mother Sullivan's Ridge.
 You didn't just come here to find
out what happened to Gillian, Anna.
 You came here to find
out what happened to you.
