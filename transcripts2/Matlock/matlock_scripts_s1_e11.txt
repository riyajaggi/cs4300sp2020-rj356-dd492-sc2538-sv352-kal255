 Hey, hey, hey, where are you going? - Out. - I've got interviews set up for you this afternoon and photos tonight. Look, Lou, I told you I'd come down and do your benefit, but that's it, okay? Angel, it's all arranged. You should have asked me first. Sorry. Angel, I'm warning you. Don't give me a hard time. - You'll do the interviews. - Stop it, Lou. You don't own me! Where are you going? I'm going to party until I drop. Lou? Lou. I need the police.

 Yeah, it's an emergency. Miss Danello? Margaret Danello? The name's Angel. May I talk to you? Maybe later, okay? This can't wait. Homicide. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Lou Pearson. - Ben? We just got a new client. - Yeah? Max Weinberg represents her in New York, called and asked us to take her case. Who is it? Top recording star, dozens of magazine covers, sold-out concert tours. Am I going to have to guess her name? She's waiting in my office right now. I just-- Remember how you always say justice is blind? Charlene, the suspense is overwhelming. Who is this person? Ben, this is Angel. Hi, Ben. What is this place, some kind of a museum? I love peanuts. No. - Ben. - No. She's a very big star. - I never heard of her. - Oh, Dad. - What is she, rock 'n' roll? - Yes, and very popular. Draws crowds of 30, 40, 50,000 people. You're kidding. Now, this is old. There'll be a very big retainer. So you want to get started? Having Lou for a manager was sort of like signing a pact with the devil. Was there a romantic involvement? No. What time did you arrive at his house last night? I'm not sure. It was after 1 2, I think. No, wait, it was after 1 . How is it you don't remember? I was partying. I went to a lot of different clubs and I drank a little too much, and I went to Lou's house to patch things up, and then I crashed. Lou was still up when I sort of passed out. Look, could I go now? Perhaps you don't recognize the gravity of your situation. The police let me go. For the moment. The police might want you back. You had a bitter argument with Mr. Pearson yesterday. You went to his house. You're not sure when. You found the body. You ran. If I were a policeman, that would make you a prime suspect in this case, Miss Danello. Please, call me Angel. The name on the docket will be Margaret Danello. That's fine with me. If I were you, I'd try real hard to remember where I was last night. Look, maybe I don't remember exactly where I was or when I was there, but I think I'd remember if I murdered Lou, okay? You know... ...every case we take on requires a little different approach. Perhaps you can jog Miss Danello's memory. I'll see what the police have to say. Excuse me. You know, he's kind of a pain. He grows on you. What are you doing here, Ben? We don't have enough to arrest your client yet. That never stopped you before. - Who is she? - That's the widow over there. They've been separated for about five months. - Any prints on these glasses? - Nothing good. Looks like Lou Pearson knew whoever it was. - Seemed like they were celebrating. - Sure looks that way. - He was stabbed, wasn't he? - In the chest. There's a pair of scissors missing from this desk set. We're looking for them. - Mrs. Pearson? - Yes? I'm Ben Matlock, Margaret-- Angel's lawyer. Well, I just told them everything I had to say. Well, only the good die young. You one of Pearson's clients? I was more than a client. We're like brothers. Yeah, like Cain and Abel. Little upset, huh? - You Detective Davis? - Yeah. Yeah, I just heard. Excuse me, who are you? Sonny Hutton. I just flew in for the concert. I was on my way from the airport when I got the news. I can't believe this. His secretary says there's a tape of yours missing. My tape? They stole my tape? The new album. Hey, if it sells like your last album, they'll lose money. Look, we still got work to do here. Hey, at least you know one thing about the killer. If the guy took Sonny's tape, he's got no taste. And you can quote me as saying that I'll be a party girl until my party is over. - Hey! That was a wire service! - I don't care if it was Tom Brokaw, - and get your feet off my desk. - Boy, have you got a lot of nerve! If I'm going to represent you, you're going to have to straighten up - and do as you're told. - And what if I don't want to? You'd better do as he says, miss. - What's that supposed to mean? - Found the missing pair of scissors. They were the murder weapon, all right. The lab says they have Pearson's blood type on them. Where'd they turn up, Rupert? Miss Danello's hotel room. You're under arrest for murder. - How much was your bail, Angel? - Two hundred thousand. - I'm an expensive date. - So why'd you do it? Guys are always dropping dead at my feet. Hold it, hold it, hold it. Miss Danello is innocent of Mr. Pearson's murder. Nonetheless, she takes the matter very seriously. At the moment, she is still shocked by this tragic event and has no comment. Isn't he adorable? Don't you ever do that. I was just giving them what they wanted. It's part of the game. It's the show. You keep forgetting you're not on a stage. You're in a courtroom. - You're on trial for murder. - Relax. - The press loves me. - Ben. Read her the headline. ''The Party's Over for Party Girl.'' They love you so much they're going to convict you before we pick a jury. Lighten up, okay? We're going to set up some rules right now. Rule number one: you are not to talk about this with anyone, especially not the press. Rule number two: the next time we go in the courtroom, you're going to wear more than just your underwear. Rule number three: the next time you tell me to lighten up, you're going to find yourself without a lawyer, without a defence, and without a prayer. Got it? There she is, an angel if ever I saw one. It is a privilege and an honour to meet you. I am perhaps your greatest fan. - Tyler Hudson at your service. - Who is this? I am their personal private investigator, but most of my time is spent investing venture capital. But sometimes I take on a special case that interests me. And Angel, this is for you, genuine Georgia pecans. Something I might market as a gift. Can we get down to business? Now, the first thing we have to do is establish where you were the night of the murder. What does the medical examiner have to say? Tyler! Oh, yeah. That Pearson died between 2 and 3:30 in the morning. I want you to think very hard. Where were you between 2 and 3:30 yesterday morning? I already told you where I was. I was partying and I don't remember. Look, if we can find someone who was with you, you might be off the hook. Okay. Okay, okay. I was at the Hard Line at 1 1 . No, that was Tuesday. Okay, I know that I was at the Dirt Club. That was on Monday. I'm not sure where I was. We're going to have to retrace your steps. We have to know where everybody was the night of the murder. The widow, Janice, Sonny Hutton, Fancy Dan. - Danny Blaster. - Whatever. He was in town that night. You're going to have to go with us. Can l--? All right. I'm on my way out of here. Angel, do you ever do endorsements? Dad, I can't make it tonight. I have an appointment. You're going to leave me alone with her? She's not exactly dangerous. I think you can protect yourself. It's not what she might do to me that concerns me. It's the other way around. What a pain. She grows on you. Have fun. You've got to be kidding. How many more of these places are there? Not enough. This is just a private party. You're kidding. Hey, baby. Dan, you're looking good. Dan, this is Ben, my lawyer. - Yeah, we've met. - Yeah. Listen, you need anything, just let me know. Can you account for your time the night of the murder? Why are you asking me? I don't know. You said you'd like to help. It might help. You never know. Let's go. Got a little bit of a temper, doesn't he? - Yeah, I guess so. - Yeah. I'll be over there. - Hi. - Hi. - I thought you had an appointment. - Oh, I do. - A musician? - No, a tax lawyer. How you doing? Okay. I'll see you in the morning. Early in the morning. Early. Right. Hi. - I saw you yesterday at Lou Pearson's. - Oh, yes. I'm Ben Matlock, Angel's lawyer. - How you doing? - Okay. Any luck finding that missing tape of yours? They looked everywhere in the house. It's gone. Oh, I'm surprised record bootleggers would be that interested. - Why is that? - Your last album didn't do all that well. Is that supposed to be a dig? Oh, no. No, no, no. I was just curious. My daughter tells me that Dan Blaster's really hot right now, and I wondered why they didn't take his tape. Maybe they listened to it first. When did you arrive in Atlanta, Mr. Hutton? I arrived Wednesday morning, 1 0 a.m. Georgia Air flight 1 83 from New York. You can check the airline on that. I think that puts me in the morning after Lou was murdered, to answer your question. I guess you're right. Clear out, clear out. Let's go. All right. Clear out, clear out. Let's go. Hey, hey, hey, cut it out. Cut it out. I noticed you two didn't really get along. You want to know where I was the night of the murder, huh? It might help. Why don't you ask my friends? Ask me if you wanna know something. No problem. Hey, aren't you a little old to be out in this night air? You're probably right. I'll see you. Yeah? In court. Ben, I've got big news. Ron, this is Ben, my lawyer. I gave Angel a ride out to Lou Pearson's house that night. - What time was that? - Let's see... It was about 1 :30. Yeah, I'm a DJ and I was on the air at 2. - I'm off tonight. - Some other time, okay? Some other time. This places you at Lou Pearson's at the time of the murder. It's big news, all right. You don't have an alibi. - What? - You don't have an alibi. Oh, yeah. Well, I'll see you tomorrow then. You'll see me tomorrow? Yeah. I'm going to go dance, and then they want me to do a few songs. I'm a party girl, remember? Angel, we're leaving. What? Let's go. Thanks, Tom. Step right in here. What is this, some kind of rehearsal? You know, I've had a few clients who didn't seem to realize the gravity of their situation. I used to bring them in here and sit them on a chair or a table and I'd browbeat them into realizing just how tough this business can be. I don't do that anymore. One, because it wears me out. Two, because most people have come to realize that prison is a mean, foul-smelling place more horrible than your worst nightmares. I'm not sure you do. - Unlock the door. - I don't have the key. But that man does. That's true. Matlock, don't take all day. Matlock! - What kept you? - Tom had stepped away. I hope you weren't frightened. - I got the message. - Good, good. Because unless you start to look and act like a lady, prison's where you're liable to be for the next 50 years. Believe me... ...it's no party. Yeah. - All right. - Baby. Yeah. I thought I told you to dress like a lady. I did. Your secret's safe with me. How was your evening? - Better than yours. - I would hope. I found out that Danny Blaster was having Lou Pearson audited. And that's why he has all the bikers around him... ...for protection. From Lou Pearson? Pearson was connected, if you know what I mean. How did you get all this information? The tax lawyer I was with is in the music business. Told you I had an appointment. I found out something else. Dan is a champagne drinker. So is Sonny Hutton. Mrs. Hoffman, how long had you been Mr. Pearson's housekeeper? - Over two years. - And was anyone else in the house - at the time you discovered the body? - No. Did you see anyone leave the house when you reported for work that morning? I saw Angel, I mean Miss Danello. - The defendant? - That's right. She was running away. No further questions, Your Honour. Your witness, Mr. Matlock. She never liked me. Ask her about the-- I'll take it from here, Margaret. Mrs. Hoffman... ...was Mr. Pearson particular about the way you kept his house? Yes, he was. Mrs. Hoffman, it's been stipulated that these scissors, People's Exhibit 6, were the weapon that killed Mr. Pearson. - Do you recognize them? - Yes, I do. They were kept on Mr. Pearson's desk, - were they not? - Yes. You cleaned the desk the day of the murder? - Yes, I did. - What is that? It appears to be rust. But Mrs. Hoffman, you testified that Mr. Pearson was a meticulous man. You let his scissors get rusty? I did nothing of the kind. Well, metal only rusts when it gets wet. You suppose someone left them outside? Objection. Calls for speculation on the part of the witness. Sustained. Mrs. Hoffman, Sergeant Davis has testified that these scissors were found in Miss Danello's hotel closet. How do you suppose they got rusty in her closet? Objection. Speculation. Relevancy? Your Honour, I am simply trying to demonstrate that it is possible that these scissors were thrown away or hidden outside someplace where they got wet. Then whoever killed Mr. Pearson came back later, got them, planted them in the defendant's room. That would explain the rust. Mr. Matlock, that does call for speculation from this witness. Objection sustained. No further questions. I call Janice Pearson. Mrs. Pearson, how long have you known the defendant? About three years. And in that time, did your husband ever discuss his personal relationship with Miss Danello? - Yes, he did. - What did he tell you? He said she had a violent temper, she was getting some bad advice from other people, and he was afraid of what she might do. - What? She's a liar. - Sit down. Mr. Matlock, the bench cautions you to control your client. Mrs. Pearson, were you ever present when Miss Danello threatened your late husband with bodily harm? Yes, I was. That is a lie. I never did. Mr. Matlock, I'm warning you-- She's just trying to bury me. Another word from you, and I'll have you removed from the courtroom. Your Honour, my client is under considerable strain. I apologize for the interruption. It won't happen again. I will not tolerate another outburst. Now, please continue. No further questions, Your Honour. Mrs. Pearson... ...have you ever been a patient at Atlanta General Hospital? I think so. It was a long time ago. I'm surprised you don't remember better. According to these medical records, you were a regular customer. In November, you checked in with a fractured arm. In January, cracked ribs. In April, abrasions and bruises. How did all these things happen? Accidents. Mrs. Pearson... ...isn't it true... ...that you filed assault charges against your husband in April of last year? Those charges were dropped. Answer the question. Isn't it true you filed assault charges against your husband? - Yes. - And isn't it true you filed those assault charges while you were being treated for those injuries at Atlanta General Hospital? - Objection. Relevancy. - Your Honour, defence is attempting to show that Mr. Pearson was himself prone to violence. Overruled. Answer the question. Could you repeat the question? ''Isn't it true you filed those assault charges while you were being treated for those injuries at Atlanta General Hospital?'' I suppose so. Then you withdrew those charges two days later after you were released. That's correct. Mrs. Pearson, are you aware that you are the sole beneficiary - of your husband's estate? - Objection, Your Honour. - Sustained. - No more questions. Court will adjourn until 9 a.m. tomorrow morning. Is that it for today? You did yourself a lot of damage today. That outburst could cost us the case with this jury. - She was lying. - I don't care if she quoted the Bible. That jury's looking at a spoiled, smart aleck kid who can't control her emotions maybe to the point she could commit murder. Now, when you come in here tomorrow, you better act right or we might as well just throw in the towel. - Anything else? - Yeah. Buy yourself a dress that doesn't look like you belong in a circus. - Ben. - Did I leave out something? No, you covered everything. - You all right? - I'm fine, okay? - Angel, I know it's been rough on you. - Look... ...I'm sick and tired of you and your father trying to scare me, okay? - I know how you must feel. - No, you don't! You don't know anything about me! I know your father was an alcoholic... ...and your mother left when you were 1 1 . I know you spent some time in reform school. Yeah... ...but you weren't there when my old man came home and beat up my mom every night. And you weren't there when I got six months for riding around in a car that I didn't know was stolen. Nobody was there but me. You can't do it alone this time. If we're going to win this case, you've got to work with us. You know something? You're a lot slicker, but you're just like him. Thank you. You're welcome. How many of those pecans did you say you bought? Two tons. Two tons? I thought I had a buyer, and at the last minute, he backed out on me. Oh, well. - Say, Ben-- - No. - Hard at work, I see. - Hey. - Oh, just reviewing the case. - Have a pecan. So where are we? - In trouble. - Well, the word I get is that Janice Pearson and Sonny Hutton have been an item - for quite some time. - Well, I'll tell you what, we can take all the stuff we've got and maybe put it in a gossip column, but we'd never influence the jury. We've got three people all with a possible motive. Janice was at a party till 4:00. Danny Blaster was at some club all night. Sonny Hutton wasn't even in town the night of the murder. Well, we've got to break one of their alibis, but they all check out. Well, I have a strong feeling this murder has something to do with Sonny Hutton's tape. - You know, the one that's missing? - Yeah. You got a clue? No. You're right. We're in trouble. Well, I'm going home. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. You know... ...it's too bad somebody can't get inside Sonny's hotel room, - take a look around. - Yeah, it's too bad. Sure is. Excuse me, could you turn my bed down? Thank you. Good night. Nice view, huh? As a rule do attorneys break into other people's hotel rooms? What room is this? What room is this? - Fifteen-twenty-seven. - Fifteen--? I check into 1 427. I guess I just made an honest mistake. Are you looking for something? I'll be running along. No, no. No, I don't think so. Look, don't get cute. Room service. I didn't order room service. You didn't order a lobster with a side order of grits? No. - Mercy, mercy, me, oh, my. - Good night. You could've told me you were coming here. So could you, but I'm glad you did, partner. - Did you find the tape? - No, but I did find this. He did it, Tyler. I just know he's our guy, maybe this can prove it. - Hey, Angel. - Sorry, not now. I'm running late. What really happened? Come on, for your fans, Angel. - Angel? - Yeah? For your fans, Angel, come on. Did you do it? Angel, can we possibly get an interview with you? You've got to be kidding. - Where's Tyler? - I haven't heard from him. We'd better hear from him soon. Nice dress. Yeah, if you're Nancy Reagan. Division 21 Superior Court of Fulton County is now in session. The Honourable Richard Cooksey presiding. All rise. Mr. Matlock? I call Daniel Blaster to the stand. Now, Mr. Blaster, Mr. Pearson... ...was your manager for eight years. Is that correct? Yes. Did you trust him? Lou was a manager and a friend. Mr. Blaster, isn't it true that you hired an accounting firm to audit the books of this man you trusted like a friend? It happens all the time in the record business. Mr. Blaster, isn't it true that Mr. Pearson threatened you if you proceeded with this audit? Lou was just kidding around. Is that why you hired bodyguards two days before the audit began? I needed extra security for my tour. Mr. Blaster, isn't it true when you played Los Angeles last year, you publicly accused Mr. Pearson of stealing from you and you were engaged in a fistfight in your dressing room? Hey, I just got a little excited. This sort of thing happens all the time. Lou knew it didn't mean anything. Where were you the night of the murder? With friends. Would these friends swear as to your whereabouts? Sure. Are these gentlemen in the front row your friends? Can you gentlemen stand up please? Would they go under the names of... ...Snake Barker, Trashcan Reed, Bones Lloyd, and Doctor Death? Right. No further questions. - Anything from Tyler? - Not yet. Your witness, Mr. Park. Mr. Blaster, are you familiar with the property at 321 2 Crestline Drive in Malibu, California? It's my beach house. Are you in the habit of loaning out that house - to your friends and associates? - Sure. In April of last year, did you loan out the use of that house to Miss Danello? - Mr. Blaster! - Yes. She stayed there. Was she alone? No. And who was staying there with her? Lou Pearson. No further questions. Your Honour, with the court's permission, I'd like to take a few minutes to confer with my client. The court will take a ten-minute recess. Why didn't you tell me you were having an affair with Lou Pearson when I asked you the first time? What happened between Lou and me was a long time ago and it's none of your business. I got caught with my pants down. I made a mistake, okay? When am I going to get it through your head I am trying to save your life? Why do you really care, anyway? I'm sorry. It's all right. I know you're scared. Tyler's here. How's business? Business is great. I understand your record sales have fallen off lately. A little. The fact is you haven't had a new album in two years, isn't that correct? That's not unusual. But it is true, isn't it? Yes, it's true. I bet Lou Pearson wasn't very happy about that. Lou wasn't worried. We just finished another album. Yeah, that's right. That was the tape you sent him. - Yes. - The one that was stolen the night of the murder. That's right. Would you like to get it back? Of course I would. It's very valuable. It's the only mix that exists. The only one? That's taking quite a chance, isn't it? There's a 24-track master at Lou's studio. The one that was stolen is the only mix. Oh, I see, I see, I see. Did you and Lou Pearson have a fight over what he thought of your album? I never saw Lou. I got into Atlanta the morning after the murder. That's right. You said you flew in - directly from New York, didn't you? - Yes. On Georgia Air flight... ...1 83. That's right. You sure you weren't in Atlanta the night Lou Pearson was murdered? Objection. The witness has already answered the question. Sustained. Your Honour, at this time, I'd like to introduce into evidence this claim check from a parking facility at the Charleston, South Carolina Airport. Recognize it? No. Doesn't the flight you're on, flight 1 83, make a stopover at Charleston? Yeah. So what? Mr. Hutton, it just so happens that a car you rented in New York is at this very moment parked at the Charleston Airport. Oh, God. You know what I think? I think you drove that car from New York to Atlanta, then back up to Charleston, parked it, got on flight 1 83 to make it appear you flew in from New York. Objection. - Pure speculation. - Sustained. Mr. Hutton, didn't you see Lou Pearson about your album? I told you I didn't see Lou. Isn't it true that he knew you were having an affair with his wife? No. Isn't it true he refused to release your album? - No. - Isn't it true he promised to destroy your career, you fought with him, and killed him? That is a lie. Mr. Hutton... ...if that missing tape were found in your rental car, wouldn't that prove you were in Atlanta and did see Lou Pearson the night of the murder? Wouldn't it, Mr. Hutton? Would you like my associate to play the tape for you? Mr. Hutton... ...not 20 minutes ago, my associate returned from Charleston, where he found your rental car, had keys made, opened the trunk, looked inside, there it was. I repeat. Would you like us to play it for you? No. In other words, Mr. Hutton, you lied about when you arrived in Atlanta. You lied about seeing Lou Pearson. You lied about the tape. You are a liar. And maybe something a lot worse. No further questions, Your Honour. We find the defendant not guilty. Order! Order! You play poker, Matlock? On occasion. Blue button. Master dub 1 29 7 7, artist Sonny Hutton, recorded June 1 st. Sounds like a full house to me. Thanks. I owe you two. - Anytime. - Anywhere. You know, for a lawyer, you're okay. I won't argue with that. Thank you. Well, Tyler, that was a very successful trip to Charleston. It sure was. You know, I met this guy at the airport who's got a truckload of frozen pie crusts. I get my hands on those suckers, I'm going into the Christmas pecan pie business. You know what? I was driving through this little town one time. It wasn't really a town. It was just a general store with a gas pump out front. And while I was gassing up, I went in and I saw the walls of the general store were just lined with these bags of salt. So I said to the fellow, I said, ''You must sell a lot of salt.'' He said, ''No, I don't sell much salt. But the fellow that sells me salt, now, he sells salt.''
