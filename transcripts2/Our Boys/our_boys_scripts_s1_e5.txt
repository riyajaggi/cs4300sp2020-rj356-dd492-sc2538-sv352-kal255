 It's not over. It's just starting. PREVIOUSLY ON OUR BOYS I love Toto Ever heard of Toto? No. Who's Toto? What is this? - His belongings. So, who is this Yosef Haim? One day you'll see... you'll be very proud of me. Avishay... - I made a mistake. Something's not right. I have to get in there. Do you have a way in? "To right and left, yu'll spread adroad"

 "and the Eternal one you shell loud" "trought the man from Peretz's family..." Ok, we have cameras in the house. Not much going on at home. Everyone's at the synagogue. Good Sabbath. - Good Sabbath, Rabbi. Gentlemen, I see the worry in your eyes. This is not a Torah lesson. The long lecture comes tomorrow. Bless the Lord, we are a community of all tribes, each of us respects the Sabbath in his own way, be it in a suit and white shirt in jeans and a colorful shirt. Rabbi Itzhak Ben Shoshan, born in Netanya, no criminal record. Known as a Chabad Rabbi. He uploads videos on current affairs with a Jewish twist.

 Extremely right wing. He created an online buzz. Tens of thousands of views. Any ties to other extremist rabbis? Ginsberg? No direct link. But he does have ties to Rabbi Shalom Dov Wolfa. We interrogated him on incitement to violence and refusing an order. Sabbath's delight also means wearing comfortable clothes. But this isn't a music festival. When it comes to clothes, the woman is wisest. The man's in charge of discipline. But when it comes to clothes, you wear whatever she tells you to. Good Sabbath. - Good Sabbath, Rabbi. OUR BOYS Chapter 5 SHABBAT SHALOM Thank you for keeping us safe. - Thank you. Is it okay to invite you to Sabbath dinner? Thank you, I've been invited already. Good Sabbath! Good Sabbath, my righteous friend. Are you stationed here? - Yeah... I got screwed. But at least you have a quorum. - Did they provide you a meal? Battle rations and potent red wine. No way! On the Sabbath? Battle rations? Better than what I used to eat in the army. How long are you stationed here? A week. It's because of that Arab kid who got burned. The Jerusalem sector is a mess. - It's a real mess. But it's quiet here. Around the villages, it's quiet. I'm Yosef Haim Ben David. I'd like to invite you to Sabbath dinner. My wife is an amazing cook. That's nice of you. Are you sure it's not a bother? Of course not! What kind of hosts would we be if you keep us safe and eat battle rations? Just let me talk to the wife for a second, don't move. I don't want to catch her off guard. Stay here. What's your name? - Rami... Good Sabbath, Rami. - Good Sabbath. Good Sabbath. Good Sabbath. Your brother is a righteous man. - He's my uncle. Does he like to have guests over? - Yes, every Sabbath. Good for him. You're a Yeshiva student? Not at the moment. - I thought so, because of the hat. I'm sorry for misleading you. - Don't be. I attended the Yeshiva up until recently, and I might be going back. But it's not for sure yet. I'm sorry. - It's alright. Really. Good news. She said it's no problem. - Great. Good Sabbath, my fellow Jew. Have you found a place for dinner? I just invited him, rabbi. I talked to my wife. Are you sure it's alright? - Sure. She couldn't be happier. Yossi, if I may... Listen to me, let me take him in tonight. Give your wife some time to get used to the idea, don't impose on her with your great big soul. First, marital bliss, then you build another layer of grace. He'll come to me tonight. I don't want to trouble anybody. - It's no trouble. Tonight with me. tomorrow, with him. And for the third meal, we'll think of something. Alright, Rabbi. Tomorrow, my place. God Willing. - Good Sabbath. Shit! There goes infiltrating the house tonight... Maybe we should send in a rescue? - No. Let's hold off. If he's going with that rabbi, he's got a good reason for it. Thank you, Rabbi, for inviting me. - Thank you for being my guest. I hope he wasn't insulted. - Yosef Haim? Of course not. I've known him for a long time. He trusts me. His wife is Chabad, so... Good Sabbath. So she and my wife bonded. The rabbi's wife: Jenia Kovalekskaya. Born in Moscow, 1975. Converted to Judaism. Changed her name to Haya Moshki. They have 4 children. Ze'ev, good Sabbath. He's coming to dinner too. This is Rami. He's on reserve duty. Let's go. Haya Moshki will be mad, we're late. I don't have a last name. Thre's no Ze'ev in Adam. Where do you come from? - Jerusalem. Where did you grow up? - In Beit Shemesh. The Cohen family. I moved to Jerusalem for work. Who's your father? - Rafael Cohen. He passed when I was 14. Wife? Children? - Not yet. God willing. Isn't that his real identity? He said his name is Rami, but all the rest is true. Why is he telling them all that? - I have no idea. Yosef Haim looks familiar. Maybe from work? He sells eyewear, runs the world from his shop. But he comes from a Torah household. He can't sit still, always on the go. And he has this emotional unrest. Forgive me. No disrespect. That's why he had some trouble at home. But he's a man of grace. He volunteers with Search and Rescue, donates money, he helps his nephews... He has potential, that's what I told the family, and with God's grace, they had a miracle... Bless the Lord. - You'll have your miracle, too. I can tell you're at crossroads. I want to hear all about it. By the end of this Sabbath, I will understand your "menies". "Menies"? - It's Yiddish. I've become an Ashkenazi. Preventions, preventions... We'll dig into your entire life. Like a plumber. There's a reason you're on duty here. With His hands He creates both rich and poor... I sing in His honor a song... I sing in His honor a song... The Rock, protector of the poor... Truth is His name. Rider of the wheels... Who can precede Him... Light angels... What is this song? We're Ashkenazim, how should I know? Good Sabbath. - Cheers. I see you know the tune. Not many people do. I grew up on Samy Elmaghribi. - You're Moroccan? My mother is from Mogador. My late father was from Fes. They must have fought a lot. - Of course. Where is your mother now? Still in Beit Shemesh? Actually, she's living with me. She fell down a few times, so my brothers and I decided she should live with me. I didn't want an old age home or assisted living... She raised six children, bless the Lord. That's wonderful. You hear that? Honor thy parents. It should be so obvious, yet people forget. "Do not cast me away." Well done. It's nothing special... - It's special. Very special. Cheers! Believe me it's special. But this shouldn't prevent you from having your own family. Otherwise, what is the point? - Yes. The way you eat... Is this how a guy is supposed to eat? No. - Eat like a man! Move it, Simon, get going! How does the Lord provide for you, what do you do for a living? Cooling. I install air conditioners. May I ask what you do? Theoretical mathematics. Impressive. - Don't go there. Even if you tried, you couldn't understand. Ze'ev has a sharp mind. If he were Prime Minister, the whole mess in this country would be solved. All the greatest rabbis have the minds of mathematicians. Rabbi Ginsberg was a mathematician. Religious mathematicians aren't a high- risk group. Explain it to me, I'm a simple man. How do we solve the mess in this country? Take for example the Arab boy who got burned. Ze'ev, tell him what you told me. I don't trust this guy. - Why wouldn't you trust him? He doesn't look like an AC guy. Haya, speak Hebrew, not Russain. He says he doesn't trust Simon. That he's no AC technician. What air conditioner? - Excuse me? Elektra? Tadiran? Ze'ev, Hebrew. He wants to know what kind of air conditioner you install. Maybe he wants one in his house. I'm sorry... I'm not a private technician. I work for large institutions. The Ministry of Defense, the army, the Shabak... What's with him? - Maybe he drank too much. Ze'ev doesn't like the Shabak, he thinks it's like the KGB. All I do is install ACs. If Shabak was KGB, the Arabs wouldn't kidnap three Jews, children, kill them, and take three weeks to find them! What does the KGB know that the Shabak doesn't? KGB knows everything. What you think, doing, about your family, everything. Shabak thinks it knows, but it doesn't. Is that good or bad? - It doesn't matter. It's a fact. Shabak doesn't know. Sees, hears, doesn't understand. Good for Arabs, bad for Jews. I wish the Shabak was like the KGB, but with the Arabs, not the Jews. Shabak knows nothing. Who is this Ze'ev guy? Judging by his Hebrew, he's been here around five years... Ze'ev, he's got a theory... Tell him what you told me this morning. Go on, say it! An Arab is ready to do everything. Right? He's not rational. Killing children, women, baby. Blows up on bus. Crazy, no heart. Why is this good for him? Because we get scared and want to run away... No. Is like in mathematics. If one side is rational, and other side is irrational, strength doesn't matter. It's like... An equation. - Yes. So what are you saying? If Jew operates irrational from here, not from here, and Arab is rational, then the Jew has power. Other way around, Jew loses. Because from math point of view, one burned Arab boy is very good. For Jews. If he's saying what I think he's saying, it's a call to violence. It's implied, but the rabbi is quiet. But it's no coincidence that this mathematician is there. And the Chabad connection... - We got nothing. It's like our weekly Torah portion. Phinhas the priest, a righteous man, picks up the spear, catches Zimri, a kosher Jew, with that Midian gentile woman, and stabs him. Where? Through her sexual organs. - That's right. If it wasn't written in Scripture, it could never be said. He drives the spear in the spot of the offence. Is that rational? No. It's emotion. It's emotion bursting from the deepest part of the Jewish soul. He isn't thinking whether it's good or bad or who will win the negotiation. He knows it must be done. Boom! He does it! No talk. That must indicate something. Let's send it to Korb. It's totally incitement. Did he talk to Yosef Haim before the murder? Did he influence him? I don't know who killed this Arab boy, but if it was a Jew, it was an act of great sacrifice for the Jewish people, out of his terrible pain over the boys who were killed so young. Because I have, bless the Lord, a daughter with a great, pure soul, who came down to this earth to be purified in suffering. I see the divine presence in her soul. And in ours. It's beyond words. Or even thoughts. God's truth is not intellectual. Sometimes, God works through us and fixes the world without asking us. What is rational about that? Where is he going? Switch to another camera. He's smoking. - On the Sabbath? Must be a matter of life and death. That's fucked up. I'm so full. The daring men in enemy land. You okay? Who's Rami? Some guy I used to know... Sounded like you know him really well. Rami, the Shabak's AC installer. - Yeah, part- time. Then he studies the Torah at some Kolel... And he grew up in Beit Shemesh. His father died when he was 14. - I had no choice. That's a fine line, Simon. If we're treating this group as suspect, your secrecy matters. Do they look suspect to you? The what are we doing here? What that mathematician and the rabbi said was incitement. If we find a link between him and Yosef Haim... What incitement? My brother could've said the same thing. And his kids could've said that, and anyone I grew up with. It's just a group of miserable people who sought and found meaning. It's their way of expressing their love of country. They take love of country to the most primitive, racist and non- Jewish place. That Russian guy, Ze'ev, is right. You don't know anything about them. Excuse me, about us... Simon, what's going on? Put someone in there who doesn't know the language, the songs, doesn't have a cousin who knows another cousin, No one's going to talk to you. They'd all shut up. I did what I had to so they'd trust me. You put the operation at risk. I didn't put anything at risk. This isn't enemy territory. I'm not sure. Simon, should I be worried? No. Rise, Palestinian, rise! In Jaffa, Haifa and Halhul! Suha? Why did you lock the door? Why did you lock yourself in? Didn't you break the fast? I drank water. - I'll heat up the food for you. At least have a bite. - I don't want any. Avishai! Did you know you talk in your sleep? What did I say? - You said "loser" a few times. You should work on it. - How? Here, this'll help you sleep. Is Grandpa still on your case about the Yeshiva? Yeah. - What did you tell him? That I'd think about it. Avishai, we said you'd come work for me. I've got a big order on Sunday and I need you. And I'm planning my next trip to China. How about coming with me? I don't think it's a good idea. - Avishai! Don't bail on me now. Yosef, let us sleep. Quiet, Avi, go back to sleep! I'm telling you, do something with your hands, and the noise in your head will go away. Go the Yeshiva, the noise will just get louder. Trust me. Okay. Good night. Mohammed: "The machine was broken." "Was it expensive?" "I'm not the one who broke it." Toto: "Just tell me it's not you they're talking about on the media." Mohammed, look. 1, 2, 3, 4... 1, 2, turn to the left... 1, 2, 3, 4... Left leg up, right leg up. Mohammed, practice and send me, so I can see, okay? Bye, Mohammed. Good Sabbath. Everything okay? - Yes. Thank you for asking... Do I not look okay? - You shouldn't be out here. With all the tension, that's why they brought in more reserve soldiers. I'm Rami. We talked earlier, at the synagogue. What did you say your name was? - Avishai Elbaz. You're staying at your uncle's? - Yeah, in that house... Come, I'll walk you back. - No. I'm leaving the village. Now? It's the Sabbath... - To Neve Ya'akov. That's hours away. And it's dangerous. There's a way through the valley. It's a kilometer. And it's within the Sabbath boundaries. I've done it before. Good Sabbath. Avishai! Avishai, stop! Is everything alright? - I have to get out of here. I have to go back to the Yeshiva. - What Yeshiva? Stop. You told me you left the Yeshiva. That's the problem. I have to go back. To get out of here. Is it just the Yeshiva? Or is something else bothering you? I think I'm going to take a vow of silence. On the Sabbath? Is that allowed? Avishai, if there is something you want to tell me, you should. This is no time for a vow of silence. Stop. You don't know me, but you can trust me. I want to help you. I know what it feels like to be at a Yeshiva boarding school. I know what it's like to miss your parents. I can't let you go. It's dangerous. Are you on your vow of silence already? Let me walk you back to your uncle's house... I'm not leaving you alone until you tell me you don't leave the village. I won't leave the village. And from now on, I'm taking a vow of silence. Avishai, what's going on? Wait, come here. Sit down. What is this? Where have you been? Were you out all night? Avishai, I see something's wrong. If you want to talk, I'm here. You can talk to me about anything. Really. What is this? A vow of silence? You're a guest in my house and you've taken a vow of silence? Imagine if I was a guest at your parents' house and I sat there in silence the whole Sabbath? Good Sabbath, Rami, righteous man. How are you? How was your shift? With God's help. Anything I can do to help Him help you? A vow of silence. What do you think about a vow of silence? I'm against making vows, but if it's necessary, it's one of the most blessed vows. Rami, I don't think you need to take a vow of silence. Maybe I do, with all the negative talk that I blurt out. Something is weighing on you. I know. "A worry in a man's heart, speak it away." Talk to someone about it. But, if you can't find anyone, as they say, move on. Let it go. Good Sabbath, Rami! Good Sabbath! Excuse me, Rabbi, today is my turn, isn't it? Mike, Simon's on the way to the house. Okay. Alright. Mike and Korb are on their way. Good Sabbath! - Hadasa is sleeping. Good Sabbath to the lady of the house. Thank you for your hospitality. - This is Rami. We've got plenty of food. Can I help with anything? - God, no, you're a guest. Sit down, the table will be ready soon. It's nice here. Spacious. Have you been here a long time? Three years. We used to live in a dump in Har Nof. This place is a miracle. Forty square meters here, tons of ventilation... I brought these two from China. Massage chairs, not on the Sabbath. Come during the week. It's like Thai massage. Special aquarium for salt water. 15.000 shekels. - Really? Good for you. I'll show you the outside space. - Can I use your bathroom? The one down here is taken. Upstairs, on the right. Make yourself at home. - Thank you. Hello, Avishai. I'm just looking for the bathroom. Are you still on your vow of silence? I just wanted to tell you I kept thinking about you at night, and during the morning prayer. You know, "a worry in a man's heart, speak it away." Have you heard that? Sometimes, it's best to talk to someone you don't know. I'm here, if you want. I seek my brethren... Please, not another hour of this singing... A real choir, these guys. I seek my brethren, Tell me, I pray thee... Good Sabbath. Where they are feeding the flock. Where they are feeding the flock. Nice. You all sing so well. Wait till he gets to the point. Do you sing this new songs at your parents' house? We sing, but not these songs. Last night, at Rabbi Ben Shoshan's, it was also very nice. He too knows how to sing. Are you close? To be honest with you, the rabbi is not our style. He's more "of the people". My dad is an extreme "adversarial". Moroccan, but as Lithuanian as you can imagine. My nephews are like that, too. One of them studies with a major rabbi... I forgot his name. He's got a Kolel in Har Nof. A Moroccan guy, too. Tough, but a great scholar. What's the name of his Kolel? - It slipped my mind... Try to remember! Rabbi Shalom Ben David's Kolel? - Yes! Shalom Ben David! That's my dad. Their grandfather. - You don't say... He knows him. My nephew really admires him. So, how'd you marry a Chabad girl? How'd you know she was Chabad? Does it show? Forgive me. Rabbi Ben Shoshan told me... And the walls at home tell all. You know what Rabbi Shach said about Chabad? They're as close as it gets to Judaism. I'm kidding, Pnina. I'm kidding. They've got many fine qualities. Ben Shoshan keeps talking about a Jewish soul, and he married a blonde Russian girl. Isn't that hypocritical? She's a righteous convert. But I'm talking about him. Here ends the story of the dangerous spiritual leader, Rabbi Ben Shoshan. You should've heard him yesterday. - It's nowhere near criminal. I know things, it's no coincidence, and they have problems with their daughter. That's no accident either. You wouldn't marry a convert? - Me? Never. Moses married a convert. Just because God opened a donkey's mouth doesn't mean a turtle can guess the World Cup. I don't understand. - A gentile is a gentile. I'm sure many justified sleep with gentile women by thinking they'll convert them, but until Phinehas has stabbed two men, people didn't get it. That's why God said he turned his anger away and stopped the plague. So you can compare to Phinhas? You should have stayed at study hall. What's this got to do with it? All this talk about why he did it and the holy spirit. No. Common sense. It's not that simple. - It's not complicated either. That's what happens when you study Torah of the Ashkenazim. Sometimes you have to pick up a sword and slaughter. Or burn... - Yeah, what's the difference? Don't justify the monsters who burned that boy! Pnina, all of a sudden, everyone remembers his name? Abu Khdeir, Abu My- Ass. You know why they remember his name? Because one Arab has to die so we'd forget 100 Jews who died before. Does anyone remember Shalhevet Pas? The Fogel family? Just leave them alone. Yosef Haim! - I'm calm. From what I hear, they're closing in on them. Here it comes. That's bull... How would you know? There are videos of the kidnapping online. Yesterday, at my post, there was this guy who kept watching the videos and I peeked over at his phone. What did you see? - Not that much. Two young guys come up, then you see the car go. And there are images from some an Arab corner store. Who posted them? How do they know it's the kidnapping? I don't know any more than you do. Maybe they weren't even Jews. I hope they weren't. Who burns a man alive? Whoever did it is no longer a Jew. How do you know he was burned alive? I don't want to hear this. So they burned him. Those goddamn Arabs shot a two- year- old in the head. Yosef Haim, shut up! They aimed their guns at a baby! - Shut up already! I can't listen to you anymore. What do you say? - It's getting somewhere. Excuse me. Okay, Fishman, let's go. Upload the videos. Look, I shot this from my neighbor's security camera. Show them! We will, but it's hard to tell who the killers are. And the police haven't announced if it was criminal or political. Of course it was political. The police is lying. They want to hide their mistake, not catching them in time! You were the last person who saw Mohammed. What happened afterwards? Suha, tell him. What for? Tell them, so they can catch these Nazis. Matania: "Check it out! Footage of the abduction of the Arab faggot." "Whoever did it, an act of Phinhas!" Yossi... "Why are you answering a text on the Sabbath?" "From Matanya." Wait, Matania is... - One of the nephews. Yosef Haim: "It's for gods praise." Matania: You've heard of "tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye"? Yosef Haim: "So?" Matania: "So, this Abu Khdeir is an ass for an ass..." Yosef Haim: "Haha" Matania: "It's a good one, right?" Yosef Haim: "Can you keep a secret even your sweater won't hear?" Matania: "What?" Yosef Haim: "Ass is me, man." Matania: "What does that mean?" Yosef Haim: "Come after the Sabbath, I got something to tell you." Push him a little more. Matania: "Cool, but give me a hint." Yosef Haim: "When does Yinon turn his phone on?" After the Havdalah... The saint... We're on Yinon, right? - Of course. Let's start with Avishai. He obviously knows something. He's under some crazy stress. He's threatened by his uncle. But I don't think he's one of the three. He seemed close to Yosef Haim. He's part of the gang, but I know his type. I know him really well. He has zero capacity for violence. He's a leaf in the wind. Yinon is a done deal, right? According to the text messages and the talk in the car. I assume Yosef Haim will call him as soon as the Sabbath is out. Kobi is a clown, he's harmless. We saw he doesn't have a clue. Matanya, I don't think so. He's not close to Yosef Haim, and he's practically non- religious. Our guys are religious, for sure. If I had to bet, I'd say Avi. He's pretty violent, quiet, and close to Yosef Haim. His Facebook is full of likes for Lehava and "The People of Israel Demand Revenge." So, the two guys Yosef Haim calls after the Sabbath are the ones. We arrest them with Yosef Haim. - Uri? If it gets to obstruction of justice, I'm with you. When is the Sabbath over? - Fishman? In 75 minutes. Avishai? Avishai? Have you seen Avishai? - He's not in the room? No. Go look for him. - Let him walk around. Look for him! Why do you have to argue? Pnina? Have you seen Avishai? Blessed art thou who distinguishes Holiness from the everyday. Good week to you. Where are you headed? Nice. A vow of silence is a good thing. I'm headed to Jerusalem. Is that good for you? Back to the Yeshiva? That's nice. Get in, righteous one. Hello? Yinon, I gotta tell you something. - What's going on? Remember the clothes that guy got you from China? The shorts and the t- shirt? - I remember. What about them? You need to burn them, they're shatnez. Burn them? - Yeah. Don't leave a trace. What's "shatnez"? Halakha doesn't allow clothes made of both wool and linen. So you're supposed to burn them? - No. He wants him to burn the clothes they wore on the night of the murder. That's tampering with the evidence. - He's calling someone else. Fuck! What did I tell you? That's our man. - A leaf in the wind? Yosef Haim Avishai, where'd you go? Is this about that vow of silence? Anyway, remember the clothes from China? Burn them, there're shatnez, the clothes from China, so just burn them, as soon as possible. Get back to me as soon as you can. Good week. Good job, Simon! Suha, take this. - Who is it? President Abu Mazen, he wants to console you. He's on the phone. Talk to him. Hello. Thank you... Thank you. Praise God. Thank you, be well. Goodbye. I don't want to talk to anyone! He's the Palestinian President! He supports us. What can the president do? Mohammed died and I couldn't look at his face! The President will send a message to the presidents of the world to catch the criminals. So they'll catch them. Then what? I don't Mohammed to be forgotten. - If I could, I'd burn them too! Good week! - Good week. Where are you? On the way to the old age home. I told mom to stay at my place until tomorrow. But she was determined to go. - I don't want her to go. I want her to stay with me. Did you hear me? - Are you sure? Tell her that I apologize and not to argue about it. I'll pick her up from your place. And I'll return your skullcap. - Well done. Thanks. You're a good student. Better than I was at your age. Avishai, I want to take advantage of your vow of silence to say a few things without interruption. Okay? Forgive me for the anger I had towards you. I guess you needed more time to decide you were going back to the Yeshiva. With God's help, you're on the righteous path now, and I am very proud of you, Avishai, and I hope you can forgive me for my anger. Yinon. Yinon! What? Who is it? - Police. Calm down. Who's there? - Don't move! Who are you? Who are you? Avishay! - Police. Don't move. Wrap up! Wrap up! Where are you taking him? Ya'akov! Come here, my love. Help! Yosef Haim! Yosef Haim! Yosef Haim! Yosef Haim! - Calm down! I'm Alina. We won't hurt you. I didn't do anything! - Be quiet! Good week, Simon. - Good week. END OF EPISODE 5 If you don't start talking now, they'll dump it all on you. ON THE NEXT OUR BOYS We caught your son's killers. The Shabak and police conducted a major operation. They did a good job. - Good job? Do you have a plan? Dvora, were seconds away from all out war. You have to help me. - No, I don't. OUR BOYS
