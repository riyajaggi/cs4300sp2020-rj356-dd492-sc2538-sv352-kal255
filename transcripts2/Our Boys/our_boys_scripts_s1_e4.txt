 Good luck today. Don't worry. Just focus. Be yourself. Are you okay? -Why did you ask? Don't I look okay? You look great. You look just like... Like a real Yeshiva guy. -But you asked. If something's wrong, tell me. I'm proud of you. Why do you have to turn everything into a problem? You're going back the yeshiva where you belong, we are very happy. Get on already! What's with you? Get on already!

 I am writing according to the instructions. Situation: I did not get on the bus to the Yeshiva. Emotion: Anxiety, 100. Depression, 90. Shame, 100. Automatic thought: I am a complete loser. I don't stand a chance in life. And that's on top of being ungrateful toward dad and grandpa. I'll never be able to get back to the Yeshiva, so maybe I'm better off dead, because I'm just a burden on everybody. Excellent. Okay... So we have: Situation: Bus. Feeling... Anxiety: 100. 100, Avishai?

 Fine. Automatic thought... Supporting evidence, contradicting evidence. Okay. Avishai, you read it to me, start with the supporting... I'd like to leave earlier today. Avishai, look at me. Is something wrong? -No, no... OUR BOYS Chapter 4: THE DAWN MARTYR So, who is this Yosef Haim Ben David? Not who we expected, that's for sure. What do we have? His phone traced to the Jerusalem Forest on the night of the murder and ownership of the Honda. We haven't found any ties to extremist organizations. It's still under investigation. His house, in Adam. Two kilometers from Jerusalem, next to Hizma. As you can see, the settlement is hooked up. No extremists here. Just people looking for better housing. Born and raised in Har Nof, right above the crime scene. Few of his siblings and his parents still live there. His father, Rabbi Shalom Ben David, is a well-known in Har Nof. He's 29, married to Pnina, they've got an 18-month-old baby. No criminal record, he's been under psychiatric treatment for a few years, and we're checking out why. Alina. His psychiatrist's name is Dvora Segal. We have a subpoena for his medical records. He's not one of these two, so he must be the driver. As for the other two, we've got nothing yet. So you've got nothing on nobody. This is the well-known Uri Korb, Deputy District Attorney for the Jerusalem District. He's accompanying the investigation on behalf of the prosecution. What do you think? I hope that by Shabbath we'll arrest the prime suspect. You sure about that? -That's our aspiration. Listen. Here's the directive and I'm coming from the cabinet with this. We have to work with the highest possible bar for this arrest. What does that mean? You don't arrest anybody unless you've got 100 percent certainty. We need time, because from a PR stand point, it's a disaster. Understood. Up until yesterday we were the victim, we could do anything. Mike, stretch it as long as you can, buy me time. Do not cleanse the blood of the martyr! We salute his mother! We'll bury him in the Temple Mount. -God Willing! To the Temple Mount we march, millions of martyrs! Make way, let us through. To the Temple Mount we march, millions of martyrs! They only understand force. Don't be afraid. They know you're backed by youths who are prepared to die. Don't believe everything they tell you. Stop, Majid. I know how to handle this. My condolences, Abu Iyad. Where is he? -On his way. I'd like to thank you for honoring our agreement and coming with two ambulances. Let's discuss the funeral arrangements. What kind of police force negotiates over dead bodies? You have an army, soldiers... -This is not the time to fight. Let Hussein talk. Hussein, come with me, let's talk. Why haven't you dug the grave yet? You're burying him in Shuafat? -I haven't decided yet. Everybody wants to bury him in the cemetery in the Temple Mount. You gave me your word. -No, I didn't. I told you his mother wants him close to home, in Shuafat cemetery. If you don't bury him in Shuafat, I can't release the body. We don't want the masses marching on the Temple Mount. That's a world war. Do you understand that? I don't want any more blood spilled here. When my son's blood was spilled, you didn't care! I wish we could have prevented it. We're the police, Hussein, not God. You want me to sign an agreement that I'll bury him in Shuafat? Give me a piece of paper. -No, I trust you. Then go get him. -I'm glad we agreed. But there's one more thing. The situation is volatile in Jerusalem, so hold the funeral at night, when everyone's breaking the fast. Fewer people show up, it'll be less dangerous. Okay? It's better for everyone. -No, no, no. I'm having his funeral during the day, the proper way. You want a world war? -You want to give him to me? Give him. You don't? You know what will happen. Hussein! -I want to bury him now. Wait. Mike? ...that Mohammed, son of Abed-Allah ben Numair, has told us that Abu-Mowaya so told him Al-Amash, from the mouth Masaruk, who heard from Abed Alla Ben Morah, and said we asked Abed Allah about this verse: "Do not think those killed on behalf of the Lord's path are dead." "They live alongside the Lord." MATH Iyad, what does this say? Smile. Foot... I love Toto. What is Toto? -I have no idea. Where are you going? -I don't want to sit here. Don't throw stones! They'll shoot you! Who cares? -Please, son, stay here. I want to see Mohammed. -No. None of us will see Mohammed like this. Okay. -Okay what? Okay, have the funeral now. As long as it's in Shuafat. Where is he? I don't see your ambulance. He's coming. He's here. Hussein, you have to identify the body. It's protocol. Majid, go. You have to sign here. I'm sorry. It's his forensics envelope. These are his belongings. Sign here. Hussein. Hussein! Hussein, go in the empty ambulance so they'll think the body is there. Hussein! -Enough with the "Hussein, Hussein". Let me take my boy home. Go! Dr. Segal? -Yes. Please, come on Sunday. I'm done working, it's Shabbath. -It's urgent. Come in. Okay. I should say in advance that I don't cooperate with all the... All the what? -The legal and welfare authorities. I'm not sure you understand the sensitivities in this community, you usually do more harm than good. What would you like to know about Yosef Haim Ben David? I want to make sure you know that what I'll tell you is confidential. I'm sure you heard about the murder of the Arab boy. Yosef Haim Ben David is our prime suspect. When's the last time you saw him? Dvora? -Yes. A few days ago, I can't remember exactly. I have my appointment calendar in the clinic. Hello. -Good afternoon. What is your name? -Simon. This is my husband, professor Amitay Dikstein. Simon is from the Prime Minister's office. Is everything okay? -One of my patients... It's confidential. I'd like to point out that I am a lawyer as well. I don't practice, but if you need advice... We'll just go down to the clinic and go over a few things. Are you sure? So far, so good. He was here on Monday to pick up his prescriptions. Was there anything odd about him? His behavior? No, he was hypo-manic like he has been recently, he talks a lot, doesn't sleep, does a lot of shopping. Gifts to himself, his nephews. It's not a psychotic state. Can it lead to violence? Nothing that would be relevant. -I'll decide what's relevant. Okay. I can come back with a search warrant and take all you've got. Then do it. -Okay. Don't leave the house for the next few hours. Simon! I want to explain something. This is exactly the point. Please, sit down. Look... About a year ago, he woke up with an obsessive thought that he was going to hurt his baby. Yosef Haim? -Yes. He never laid a finger on her. He asked his wife to take her to his parents. Then he came right here, and I recommended hospitalization. And you didn't report this? The law states that only if there is a reason to believe that an offense has been committed against a minor, we should report. I see. -No, you don't. Now you've branded him dangerous for life, for no reason, and that's what the police would've done. I do well with the ultra-orthodox community because I work with them, within the family, within the community. In coordination with the rabbis. And it works. Until now. -Are you sure it's him? Have you arrested him? Tell me, his family, these nephews he buys things for. Do you know any of them? -I'm sorry I can't answer that. Your warrant doesn't cover that. It's the martyr's body! Take it easy, guys! Not like this! Preserve the honor of the martyr! How will we get through? Preserve the honor of the martyr! Not like this! The martyr is there! -Guys, be patient! Not like this, guys! Guys, please! Calm down! This is undignified. It's undignified. Allah is great! I need a road block, route 60, all the way to the Old City, airtight. ASAP. Allah is great! Stop, bring him back! Majid, I want my son back. He's not only your son anymore. To the Temple Mount we march, millions of martyrs! But it looks like they're locals. We know the Hamas and the Jihad want an escalation, but this doesn't look planned. Get closer to them. Raise the phone. I want to see faces. I don't know, maybe local instigators. Might be the family. Don't let them pass the roadblock. Whatever it takes. They want to reach Temple Mount. There is no god but Allah, Allah loves the martyr! Iyad, stay strong! They won't let us reach Temple Mount. There will be a massacre today. We have to do something, Majid! Do what? -Repeat after me. The martyr of dawn united the Palestinians! The martyr of dawn united the Palestinians! The martyr of dawn united the Palestinians! Looks like they're turning around. The martyr of dawn united the Palestinians! This isn't over. It's just starting. You got cameras on the cemetery? -Yeah. An arrest of suspects in the boy's murder could calm things down. It'll show that we're doing our job. We don't have enough evidence. Not even for the main suspect from Adam? There's tons of material. -Not for an arrest. Then you push too, Avishai. You afraid of these Ashkenazim? Tell him it's for Rabbi Shalom Ben David, you'll go ahead of others. Remember, Jerusalem kugel, not the regular kind. The spicy one, otherwise he won't eat it. Get two. No, ten. I'll pick you up at the bus stop. Alright. What's that on the roof? Can anyone tell me what's on the roof? My good man, it's bad for your eyes to look up at the sun. I know, I need to work on that. Thank you for pointing it out. You thinking of enlisting? -I don't know. I'm only sixteen. -Sure, in your own time. But don't look at the sun. Avi, the car is arriving, give us faces. Is that a Tavor? -Yes. Good for you. Where to? Can you ID who is who? If they're minors and not on social media, it'll be tough. I'll try. I feel bad leaving you here, bro. -It's fine, I'll wait for the bus. Well, good luck! Have a good Sabbath. An AK47 can't compare to an M16. -Of course it can. The M16 is ancient, it's been around forever. Because it's the most reliable. -AK47 is the most reliable. They're on their way to Har Nof. It's the murder scene. -The grandfather lives in Har Nof. Yo, turn here into the forest. -What for? That's where they burned the gay Arab. Let's take a look. I'm not your cabbie. If you work with Search and Rescue, when you've seen one crime scene, you've seen them all. But I haven't seen any. -Shut up already, Kobi! Yinon, did you guys jam on Wednesday? Wednesday. -Just the three of us. And you didn't call me? -No, it didn't work out. What? Way to bail, guys. There were security considerations. -Security considerations? Don't you listen to the news? -Whatever. You guys bailed. He's just pulling your chain. -Beep. "Beep"? You guys all secretive now? Kobi, shut up, you talk too much. You know why we don't take you anywhere? 'Cause you never shut up. I don't shut up? -No. What's "beep"? Fuck. This could go on for months. Mike, check it again. We're ready for an arrest. I've got men at Har Nof, just waiting for your go-ahead. Avishai, did you bring the thing? -Hold on, guys. I'm telling you now, be quiet. Grandpa's sleeping, be quiet when you go on in. Grandma's sleeping, this is a surprise for Grandpa. Nice and smooth. Okay? Let's go! Matanya! You want Grandpa to see you like this? Get your tassels out! And fix your skullcap! Okay, we have Matanya too. That's it. I have the family tree. A masterpiece. A fucking clan. Pull it up. Look at that! Our latest indication from Ben David's psychiatrist is that he has violent tendencies. She tried to gloss it over, but that's how it seems to me. Second, he's hanging out with this group of nephews. They admire him, he buys them stuff, they do what he says. Fishman, take off the girls. Children. Adults. This is the list. Those five with him are his nephews, they're at their grandfather's house. Matanya, flip it over. Hold the door. More, more, more. That's it, put it down. Sshhhh, keep it down. Grandpa! -Hello, Dad. What is this? It's for your back, Dad. It's orthopedic. What am I going to do with it? You said your back was bothering you in your studying. I'm not sitting on that thing. -It'll be good for your back. It's adjustable, it massages, try it. -No! I don't want it. Why are you wasting time and the money you don't have? Fine, fine. You're never happy. I just want to to be comfortable. You all helped him get it here? -Yes. Thank you, but if you want to do a good deed, get me a pillow for my back. Avishai, how are you? What have you got there? -Food for the Sabbath. Pnina made it. She knows you like pilaf, so she made it for you for Sabbath. And Avishai bought some Jerusalem kugel from Geula. Want some? -Not before the Sabbath. Thank Pnina for me. Yinon! -Yes, Grandpa. Come here for a second. Tell me, do you know which tractate you'll be studying in Hebron? No, Sanhedrin, I assume. I don't know if I got in or not. I spoke to the head of the Yeshiva. Did I get in? Yes? Thank God! Congratulations. -Thank you. Now instead your nonsense, treat your grandfather with some Torah wisdom. Now? -Just a taste, for the Sabbath. Sure, Grandpa. -Listen to what Yinon says. Think of something to treat your Grandpa with, too. Avishai, how about you? How about you? Have you given some thought to the Yeshiva? Have you made a decision? I, I, I... You're stuttering. Again. You know why? Your mouth has not spoken the Torah for so long. Now it's like gravel in your mouth. Like someone who never ran and now is running to catch the bus. It's impossible. Moses had a stutter. Bad stutter. But when he delivered the Torah to the people, did he stutter? Did he stutter, Avishai? No, he didn't. You know why? Because he was speaking the word of Torah. If you're immersed in the Torah, I promise you, your stutter will disappear. Avishai, come say hello to grandma. Can't you see you are making his stuttering worse? Not everyone is like you and Yinon. Maybe the yeshiva is not for him. Avishai is not like you, don't drag him down to your level. Avishai, go say hello to your grandmother. And think what words of Torah you want to speak to me. Someone get me a glass of water, please. Sanhedrin! These are all the nephews who are there: Kobi Ben David, his brother Avi Ben David, Avishai Elbaz, Yinon Edri, and his brother Matanya Edri. Now, listen up. These are the kidnappers. They're a little hard to ID. Yosef Haim. That's this? You smell like a bonfire. Who else is there? -It's Avishai. Avishai, Rachel's son? -Miri's son. Miri's son. Even they can't tell themselves apart. Say hello to Grandma. Bless you. How are you, Mom? I brought Dad an armchair. but he won't sit in it. Do you know he hid my radio? -It's good for his back. From China. He doesn't like it when people buy him nice things. God forbid he should enjoy this world a bit. Is that how a Torah scholar behaves? Tell him to give me back my radio. -The radio is in the kitchen, mom. He hid my radio. I don't know what's going on. I've been praying for three days. Have they found the boys? What boys? -The hitchhikers. May God watch over them and return them to their parents. Why aren't you saying Amen? Say Amen. Yosef Haim, say Amen. -I can't, it's past its time. Past its time? -They're dead, mom. They found them on Tuesday. They were murdered. Why didn't your father tell me? -He didn't want to upset you. They are animals! Animals! Who does such a thing? -Only animals. Who kills little children? Animals, mom. Don't cry. Margalit? May God help their families. What happened? -Losing a child is for life. Margalit? The boys... Why did you tell her? -She's praying in vain! You're an expert now? -Who'd do such a thing? Only animals. She's in a bad state. Call Dr. Segal, now. May god keep us. Avishai, leave. Margalit, my love, I'm here. Dvora! Who is it? Someone called Yosef Haim. If I tell you, could I get you in trouble? No. The Arab boy who was killed... She's not there. I'll go get her pills. Don't do anything stupid. Just so you know, they've started doing things. There are people who've done things, mom. Dad has no idea. Trust me, he has no idea. One day, you'll see, you'll be very proud of me. Very, very proud of me. Wow, that's it! It's a done deal, Simon. Let's get Korb in here. This is fucking grounds for arrest. No? Yes, get him in here. When they're in the water, we've got no sound. Yosef Haim's phone is with his clothes. Great. Killers who have time for some synchronized swimming. They won't stay much longer. Let's arrest them now, Simon. You know that it's Yosef Haim. If it's not of the other five, they must know something. We've got more work to do with them. -Look what you've got here. The quietest arrest possible, they're isolated. In minutes, the cops can be there. Their car is far away. A clean arrest. No media, no nothing. Let's do it. Hey, Mike. -What's new? Yosef Haim more or less confessed. We're trying to figure out who else was there. Look! Louder! A few Ashkenazim told you you're better than us, so now you're full of yourself. Can't I tell you anything? Everyone can smell the stink of your pride. You'll fit in real nice in Hebron Yeshiva. Loser... What do you even know about Hebron, about an upper-level Yeshiva? I suggest you take this Sabbath to do some soul-searching. I'm done talking to you. It's like talking to a five-year-old. Matanya, we're going! Why? -I'm going home. What about spending the Sabbath together? I don't feel like it. Not the Sabbath, and not in general. I want to be with grownups during the Sabbath for a change. Yinon, listen, I love you, we all love you, and we're happy you got into Hebron Yeshiva, but pull the stick out of your ass. Yinon, please, don't leave. Matanya, we're leaving. Maybe they're planning something else. This is about prevention! I'm not so sure. They don't fit the profile. What has fit the profile so far? -Enough, Itzik. What's with you? Maybe they're your relatives. -My relatives?! Then what is your deal with this Rabbi Shalom? You think you know his deal? I don't know, so neither do you, that's why I have to check it out. Give me an hour to interrogate him, and I'll tell you what happened. Uri, do we have grounds for an arrest? For Yosef Haim, yes. It's circumstantial, but it adds up. As for the others, you can detain them. But you have no evidence. It's all about confessions. Look. -Turn it on. Why can't we hear? -He's not next to his cellphone. He just got into the Ashkenazi Yeshiva and he's acting like them. Cold, mean! You call that a Torah student? He's trash. I think I'll go home too. -What? I promise, not a word about this on Sabbath. It'll be fun. Without you, I'll be stuck with them. What do you keep looking up? -No reason. Avishai, are you still taking the pills? Yeah. But I ran out of some. -Is that why you're stuttering? I don't know. Maybe I should call Dvora. -No, don't. No need. I'll get you your pills. Okay? Kobi, Avi, Sabbath is in one hour, let's go. If we leave now, we can jam before the Sabbath. Isn't Yinon coming? Soon it's Sabbath, no phones and no audio at all. Mike, I don't get it. We've arrested people for a fraction of this. You always say, first we arrest, then we investigate. Itzik, I got it! Simon, it's your call. I need this Sabbath. Something's not right. I have to figure it out. This is different... These kids... I still think some organizations could be involved. What is this place, Adam? Who calls the shots? I have to get in there. -Do you have a way in? I think so. You forgot this with me. There are a lot of people downstairs. They want to console you. And reporters... -I'll be down in a bit. What is that? The police gave it to me, Mohammed's things. We won't open it. We don't need to know what's inside. Put on your shoes, let's go downstairs. You go. I don't want to see anyone. It'll do you good. What's all the stuff outside? Mom's is going back to the old age home. It's not an old age home. -Assisted living. Sorry. Don't make me the bad guy. Mom can't live with me. The place I got you in Jerusalem is the finest. That's why I'm going, because it's the best. Thank you. -The best. Why don't you come over to me for the Sabbath? It'll do us all good. You can't be alone all the time, Shimon. Thank you, but I can't. -Sabbath is out of style for him. Cut it out, mom. Give me your skullcap. Why? To say the blessing before I drink. Don't make this into a joke. -I'm serious. Give it to me. Blessed are You, God, by whose word all comes into being. Give me back the skullcap. -I want to keep it. Did you pack her medication? -Yes. There won't be a trace of me. -Okay. The Sabbath starts in 20 minutes. Let's go. We go in and prepare for Sabbath. You got it? No yelling, set the Sabbath timer, cut the toilet paper into squares... They're in the village... Lighting of Sabbath candles on 7:13. In comes Sabbath, all is well. Avishai, where are you going? We'll light the candles. I'll be right back. -Are you okay? I'm great. -Are you sure? Don't I look okay? -No. Thank you for asking. Avishai Elbaz Did you light the candles? -Yes. Want me to get it? -No. Avishai. Good Sabbath. -Good Sabbath. I'm sorry to trouble you. I just wanted to say that... I'm sorry that I left like I did, and I'll take those pills like you said. We'll renew your prescription. How are you? Avishai? I made a mistake. Do you want to tell me about it? I know you think I have the strength to get over my difficulties, but I'm not always strong enough. I understand. Do you want to tell me about this mistake you made? Maybe I can help. I should have listened to my grandfather. About the Yeshiva, Avishai? That's the mistake? Yes. I should have gone back to the Yeshiva. And I ruined everything. Okay, Avishai, come see me on Sunday morning, before everyone, okay? At 7 a. m., can you do that? -Yes. We'll talk for a bit, and I'll get you new prescriptions. But show up Avishai. -I will, God Willing. Thank you. I'm sorry to trouble you. You're not troubling me. Call me whenever you need to. Good Sabbath, Avishai. -Good Sabbath. Avishai! Avishai, it's your turn to shower, Sabbath is almost here! To your right and your left, you will burst forth, And the Lord will you revere, By the hand of a child of Perez, We will rejoice and sing happily. Come in peace, crown of your husband, With rejoicing and cheerfulness Let's go, my beloved, to meet the bride, And let us welcome the presence of Sabbath. END OF EPISODE 4
