 What was he wearing? Do you remember? A sweatshirt with a hood. He went out in flip-flops. He was sitting here on the steps. This is Mohammed Abu Khdeir. Don't leave a message because I won't hear it. If you insist, you can text me. Salam Aleikum. Good morning, Abu Iyad. Good morning. -Do you have Khaled's number? -No. No one was with him, he was alone. His phone is ringing, he's not answering his phone. Could it be because he's angry at me?

 This is Mohammed Abu Khdeir. Don't leave a message because I won't hear it. If you insist, you can text me. I'll see if he's at Khaled's. Mr. Hussein! Is it true settlers kidnapped a boy near your shop? -Who told you that? -Rabih called. He said they grabbed someone outside your shop. Yesterday they failed to kidnap Saif's son, so they came back today? Can't be. -Police Department, Brit speaking. -Good morning. Listen, settlers took a boy from outside my shop. -It could be my son. -Please hold. -Hello? -Good morning. Hello, who am I speaking to?

 Hussein Abu Khdeir, from Shu'afat... Jerusalem. Okay. The boy you mentioned, is he your son? -Yes. -I see. How old is he? -Six... -Five years old? No, sixteen and a half. -He's not answering his phone. -What's his phone number? -Hold on, I'll tell you. -Okay. -052... -Yes. -267... -Yes. 4821. -And what's your son's name? -Mohammed. Do you remember what he was wearing? A sweatshirt with a hood and flip-flops. -Okay. -He has a phone, but he's not answering. -Maybe... -Did you see him being kidnapped? -No, the neighbors did, they told me. -The neighbors saw it. What exactly did they say? They said that settlers took a boy from outside my shop. 341, we're trying to track the phone. Khaled! Thank you. -Where's Mohammed? -I don't know, my dad just woke me up. Samir called him and said that settlers took someone. When's the last time you saw him? We were talking until 2 a.m. Here, he's online. -He was just online... -When's the last time you spoke? He didn't call you after that? At 3:47. That's a few minutes ago! What did he say? I told you, I was asleep. When I woke up, I saw that he called. Khaled... Maybe he's mad I didn't buy him the ticket to Istanbul. -Maybe he went somewhere? -No, he wanted to make up with you. This is Mohammed Abu Khdeir. Don't leave a message because I won't hear it. If you insist, you can text me. This is Mohammed Abu Khdeir... -Here's Mr. Hussein, the father. -Who? The father of the kid. -And then what did you do? -We came back here. We told him, because he knows Hebrew. He immediately called the police. This is the boy's father. -What did they look like? -We didn't see them. We came from over there. We just got a glance. I saw the driver. He looked older, with a beard like that, a bit more. -He was smoking. -How do you know he was kidnapped? -Maybe they were just fooling around? -We saw them dragging him. -We turned around and followed them. -They were speeding the whole way. -Then we came back here. -Why didn't you stay on them? They ran all the red lights. By the time the light changed, they vanished. If you were sure he was kidnapped you would've run a red light, right? So you're not 100% sure he was kidnapped. Was it my son Mohammed they took? Are you sure? -We don't know Mohammed... -We didn't see his face. But he looked like a young boy. Was he wearing a sweatshirt with a hood? Don't put words in his mouth. Are we running this investigation or do you want us to leave? -What do you say? -Same crap as yesterday. Let's write it up at the station. They're all riled up, look at them. Ramadan, you know. How many calls have we had this month? It's like the Violence Olympics. The Olympics are every four years, not every year. Let's get out of here. I don't want to ruin the investigation, but my son was here and now he isn't. -Where is he? -It doesn't work like that... It's okay, he's the father. If you gave his number, they'll find him. It's a process, there's no magic here. Just ask his mother, brothers or friends where he could be. But these guys are telling you he was abducted! Why don't you take them in for questioning? We questioned them. Cool it. If the victim was a Jew, would you sit around like this? Let's get out of here. The cops only care about the Jews. We're not human to them. Guys, calm down! Calm down, you guys! Calm down! -Majed, calm them down! -What do you mean? -What do you want to do? -Calm down! -I'll take the father to the station. -Then take him already! That's enough! You're just making matters worse, instead of figuring out where he is. Those settlers are cowards, too chicken to beat him here, they took him away. -And where were you when it happened?! -Abu Iyad, calm down. You don't kidnap someone just to slap him around. We have to move fast. -These cops aren't going to do anything. -Then you'll do it?! Ask Sheikh Talal to announce it in the mosques, we'll get all Shu'afat to protest until they bring him back. -That's no solution. -Then what is? Calm down, Majid. He should come to the station and file a complaint. -A complaint is useless! -Majid, calm down. There's a camera over the shop. I'll tell Abu George to come and open up. He's far, he won't come from Beit Safafa at this hour. There's a camera in the bird store. Musbah! -Yes? -You have a security camera? Yes, but I don't think it covers the steps. Okay, let's see the camera in the bird store. Khaled! Get over here! Listen, can you track him through his phone? He was online a few minutes ago... -Only if it's in sync with the GPS. -It is. Take a look. How was he when you last met? -Nothing special. -But when I saw him he was sad. What's "Har-Nof?" Har-Nof... It's Deir Yassin, Jerusalem Forest. What would he be doing there? -Let's go there and find him. -How do we get there? We'll take the car. I'll get it, wait here! -The Jerusalem forest is far. -It's 15 minutes by car. What do you see here? We can't see a thing. -Where's your son? -There! -There's my son, Mohammed! -Where do you see him? Here! Sitting on the stairs! That's a broken street light. Could you speak in Hebrew? It's okay, the Arab policeman will translate. I'm a Druze, not an Arab. Some Druze are Arabs, some are Israelis! Here! There's someone walking! The car is stopping! Whose car is it? Someone from here? Do you recognize it? Is it a Mazda? They're reversing in the middle of the street. Here's another car! It stopped. These are the three guys who saw them! Man, what are you...? You can't see a thing.. Maybe it's nothing. It's hard to tell. Rewind. We need your camera's hard disk, take it out. Take it out. Let me finish recording. OK, I want to go report this. -You done here? -Give me a minute, let me finish. "In the name of God, most Gracious, most Merciful." -What's going on, guys? -Give me the hard disk. God is great, God is great. Peace to the dear people of Shu'afat and Beit Hanina, the people of occupied Jerusalem. Please come out of your homes... I'm not going back to smoking now. All will be well. He'll be back. Hussein! Come with us. -Don't go! -Why are you taking him? -Don't go! They're treacherous. -It's not safe with them. Don't go. It's protocol. So we can start an investigation. -They're trash! -God help us! Forget them, they're worse than the settlers. They tracked your son's phone, meaning he'll be home soon. Come with us, everyone else will go home. Hypocrites! Don't listen to them! I'm going to the station. Don't go with them! I'll come with you. I don't want any trouble. Stay here until Mohammed gets back. You hear me? I don't want any trouble. -Trust in Allah! -Don't go! God is great! BLESSED RAMADAN ITZIK -Yes? -Simon, good morning. A kid was abducted from Shu'afat, Mohammed Abu Khdeir. We don't know the details, but... -Okay. I'm coming. -Okay. -Round everyone up. -Got it. Hello? Good morning. I can't... I'm... We finished the roof. Only the shelter is left, the machine broke, it's being repaired. It'll be ready on Thursday. Friday is half a day. Sunday for sure. All right, I'm doing my best! I can't, I'll call you later. -Simon? -Are you on Yohai? Yeah, I'm on his tracker. -He's at Yizhar. -Okay. Do you know if he went out tonight? Anything unusual? No, after the funeral he returned with the Fogelmans to Jerusalem's city center, probably for the protests. But not East Jerusalem. Then they all went to Yizhar. Okay, bring them all in for interrogation. Are you sure? They've been there the entire night. -Okay, let's see if they know anything. -Okay, I'm sending police cars. This is Mohammed Abu Khdeir. Don't leave a message because I won't hear it. If you insist, text me. Mohammed, my son. Where are you, my love? I know you'll listen to this message when you see it's from me. I'm waiting for you, so is your father. He bought you a ticket to Istanbul the day you broke the machine. He was going to give it to you today. He asked me not to tell you. He wanted to surprise you. Where are you? Okay, my love. Don't be late. Come home. I'm waiting for you. -On your way to the CP? -Affirmative, you're there already? Make a U-turn, Mike wants you at Jerusalem Forest. -Take the Angel Bakery entrance. -Why? Motorcycle cops found a body. -Whose body? -No ID yet. -Presumably a teenager. -Presumably? -The body was mutilated. -Fuck... Hussein. Where are you? -Hussein. -They haven't found him yet? No. His phone is off, it stopped ringing. They can find him even if the phone is off, don't worry. -But why would he turn off his phone? -Maybe the battery died. -Where are you? -The Shu'afat police station. -I need your phone. -I'm talking to my wife... -Talk later. -It's important. She wants to know what's going on. -Hussein? -Now. She wants to know about the investigation. -Okay... -Tell him... -I have to hang up. I'll call you later. -Hussein! -Now. -Okay. -Thank you. -It's important. We must check your calls, text messages... -When did you last see Mohammed? -Last night. Remember what time? Yesterday, before... We had Iftar meal together. He was at home, then I went to bed at around midnight. Do you remember when he left the house? No, I don't. His mom saw when he left. Give me the phone, I'll call her and tell you what time it was. Soon. Have you had any disputes recently? -Disputes? -Disputes... -With neighbors, family, a cousin? -No, no disputes. -The settlers took him. -How do you know they're settlers? The three guys from Beit Hanina saw them. They said so. They didn't say settlers. They said the driver had a beard, they could be from the Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood don't smoke. He was smoking. -Jews did this. -Do you smoke? -No... -So you're with the Muslim Brotherhood? What?! The Muslim Brotherhood? I'm not with the Muslim Brotherhood, not with Fatah, not with the Popular Front, I don't care about politics, I work with everyone, Jews, Arabs, it doesn't matter to me. I heard you had unsatisfied customers or disgruntled workers. You got all this information on me, but you can't trace my son through his phone? -We tracked his phone... -So you found Mohammed. I want to see him. I want to see Mohammed. Sit down! You think this is a coffee shop?! If you want to find your son, you better cooperate. Cooperate with what? You're asking me all these irrelevant personal questions. It's obvious, yesterday they tried to grab the Saif boy. That wasn't a kidnapping! That has nothing to do with this. Besides, how are you connected to the Saif family? I'm not. But yesterday they failed to kidnap their son, so they came for mine. Could be the same settlers. -Can I talk to you? -I'm coming. -Are you there? -I just got here. The pressure is on, just so you know. The highest ranks, they want us to put to rest that Jews did this. Then let's put it to rest. Do what you have to do, leave no stone unturned, but if these were Arabs, or if was criminal, we have to shut this thing down as soon as possible. I smell gasoline fumes like never before. I've never felt such pressure. Okay, let's talk after we figure out what happened. Hi. -Is this the kid from Shu'afat? -Looks like it. They're checking with the father. Forensics found zip ties, tire prints, a hubcap. We have a lot to work with. Was he alive when they set him on fire? We'll only know the cause of death after the autopsy. Our initial assessment is he wasn't. A person who's burned alive tries to put himself out, thrashes around. We'd see signs of that on the surrounding soil. Unless he was tied up and he couldn't move. Mohammed! Mohammed! Mohammed! Mohammed! -I can't talk now... -Khaled! I'm so happy to hear your voice. -Mohammed! -Khaled. If you're calling me to come to work, I can't today. No, not work, I just wanted to see if you're all right. -You know, when I heard the news... -What news? The body that was found in the forest, they say he was from Shu'afat. Khaled, are you there? I'm glad you're alright, bro. Call me next week, I'll arrange a work schedule. And bring your friend who wanted to work too. -What's his name? -Mohammed. -Right. -Mohammed! Hello. I'm Inspector Yifat. I'd like to ask you some questions. -Did you find him? -Nice to meet you. Please tell me again what your son was wearing. A sweatshirt, like a jacket. -You mean a hoodie? -Yes, maybe. His mother saw him before me, give me my phone, I'll call her. I'll tell you. I have her number, I'll dial for you. Okay? -Hello? -Hussein! Where are you talking from? -Why did you disappear? -Be patient. -Tell me what happened. -Just listen. -Do you hear me? -I hear you. I'm at the police station. They want to know what Mohammed was wearing. I told you, a sweatshirt with a hood, like a jacket. I think it was blue. Not sure. A blue hoodie. Does she remember if he was wearing a bracelet or a chain? Was he wearing a bracelet? He always does, but I don't know about today, if he... She doesn't remember. -Why haven't they found him? -They'll find him. Are they sure it is Mohammed that settlers took? Does she remember what underwear he had on? -What underwear did he have on? -How should I know? -She doesn't... -Ask her again. Ask her to try and remember what underwear he had on. Why do they want to know about his underwear? What happened to Mohammed? Seriously, why are you asking what underwear? -Did you find him? -These are standard questions. We need every piece of information. That's why I ask about his underwear. Hussein, what are they saying? These are standard questions. It's normal. Suha, they need as much information as possible. -Don't you know the color? -No. He has a lot of black underwear, gray, white... He has black, gray and white. And gray... She does the laundry, maybe he has other colors? Try to remember, are there other colors? Mohammed doesn't wear underwear with colors. Iyad bought new underwear, green, with red on top. -She says his brother has... -Maybe Mohammed took one. ...green underwear with a red stripe on top. Maybe he wore them. -Hussein, what are they saying? -Nothing, what can they say? -They'll find him. -When? Come home soon. -Did you find him? -Hussein? -Thank you. -But did you find him? -Do you know something? -Wait here, Sir. Thank you. The clothes presumably match. We're waiting for the DNA. But it's him. Say it... Gut feeling. Jews don't burn Arabs. It's unprecedented. It's not one of ours. And a kid, of all people. Look, I'm not naive. I'm out in the field, I know Israeli racism, but Jews don't do something like this. We shall follow the Torah Through fire and water We shall follow the Torah To sanctify God's name To sanctify God's name We do not believe in the rule of heretics We do not believe -It won't do you any good. -What? What? What? We will sanctify God's name What won't do us any good? God is our king In Him we believe Torah is our life To it we are enslaved We do not believe in the rule of heretics We shall follow the Torah To sanctify God's name We do not believe in the rule of heretics How do you feel? Why don't you lie down for a bit? Drink some water. You can break the fast under these circumstances. Don't add sin to her burden. The Sheikh permitted the youths, this is an emergency. Every Sheikh has his own laws. God willing they'll find him and they'll break the fast together. Amen, God willing. Mom... Come wash your face. Majid. Did you talk to Abu Iyad? What did the police say? His phone is off. Talk to me, my son, what did you want to tell me? I broke the machine, not Mohammed. I was scared to tell Dad. You said nothing? You always say nothing! Why? Why are you talking now? You're his older brother. You have to be like his father, you understand? Talk to me, Yohai. If you tell me what happened, maybe I can help you. But if I don't know what you're talking about... Let's say it's an act of revenge. You tell me the parameters of what it might be. You got nothing, huh? You're groping in the dark and you don't have a lead. Just because I'm not telling you doesn't mean we don't have a lead. Something happened this morning, I need you to start talking, Yohai. Come on, I don't have all day. I need something to justify... our little arrangement. Revenge? In general? Yes, there's a million people who want revenge on the Arabs after they watched the burials of three kids... No, no. Not a million people. I'm talking about your friends, I need something specific. Tell me about a plan for revenge that you heard. They did talk about revenge, right? In front of you. I don't know about any such plan. Too bad. I'm not ruling out the option that... ...someone tossed the idea around, but... -I don't know of anything specific. -What idea? There was talk of kidnapping an Arab. Holding him hostage. Whose idea was it? -You got a name? -Me. I said it. You. I wish I had the devotion to do something like that. Instead I'm here. With you. We traced the boy's phone. It more or less confirms this route. No definite ID yet on the make or color of the car, but we're collecting traffic cam footage. This was before 4 a.m., not much traffic at that hour. Okay, thank you. Let's get back to work and meet up at CP in 30 minutes. Avi, you talk to the press. Emphasize that all leads are being investigated and don't give them any details beyond that. Don't say a boy, say a body. We have a missing person from Shu'afat, a body in Jerusalem Forest and we can't link the two. Don't say "terrorist attack," or "nationalist," or "nationalist background." There is no background. There's just a body. -Okay? -Okay. Now go. Don't jump to conclusions, I know what you're thinking. Wait. Anything's possible. Look at this text I just got. Look. "Before the blood libels get started" "know that the Arab that was horrifically murdered today" "was murdered by his relatives, it was an honor killing." -"Spread the word." -You're spreading this. If I got it, so did 50,000 other people. -And the day hasn't even started. -What does it mean? That we have to control the hysteria. We're following these texts. No one wants to believe that Jews did this, but the Arabs are convinced Jews did it, and to be honest, so am I. What? Give me your analysis. This wasn't a lynch by some hotheads or a murder someone was trying to hide. This is a statement. A burned Arab boy on the side of the road one day after the funerals of the three boys, this is a strategic attack. They knew it could set the whole region on fire. I don't know who or why, but it's in line with the statements of Yohai and Fogelman. Simon, whenever we have this conversation I'm surprised that you don't get who you're dealing with. Yes. They'll say they want to carry out a terrorist attack, a strategic terrorist attack, but there's a huge difference between what they say and what they do. A huge difference. What do we have? Burning down mosques, olive trees and a few beatings? You know why? Because this is life in prison and no one in this gang, no matter how radical, would throw their life away for one dead Arab boy. It's not worth it. -Then who did it? -I don't know. But the criminal lead seems totally real to me. Then why was the body dumped here, near Kiryat Yovel, Har Nof, Bayit VaGan, among Jewish neighborhoods? Let's check. Let's find out. Can you confirm that this is the body of the boy that was kidnapped in Shu'afat? We can't establish a link between the boy that was forced into the car and the body. That's being looked into as we speak. We're examining all leads and I stress, there are several leads, I ask that the residents of Jerusalem exhibit restraint. Thank you. We need heavy granite stones! Go get me... Khaled! Get me granite stones. -Where from? -Just go! Stop it, Iyad! Your parents don't need another tragedy. I said, get me some granite! Go get them! I don't care where! -I'm Chief Superintendent Avi Levi. -Did you find my son? -I'm in charge of the investigation. -Where is my son? I've been here since this morning and I know nothing. You took my phone away, you took... What?! What did I do?! -Take it easy. -Tell me what's going on. It'll be alright. Calm down. Would you like something to drink? -I'm fasting. -Oh, right. I'm sorry. Please sit down. I want to show you something. Play it again. Zoom in on the left guy's hand. It's a watch. I think it's black. Don't rely on the colors, it could be gray or brown... The color doesn't matter. Let's go to Shu'afat and show me one Palestinian boy wearing a watch. You won't find any. What about the shoes? Can you get a clothing expert? I want to know the type of shoe, where it can be bought. Go back to the shoe for a second. Looks like "Caterpillar." We can compare it to the tracks at the scene. Any insight on the repetitive hand gesture? I can't say for sure, it's very strange. But if I had to guess, I'd say he's on some sort of medication. Some meds affect motor function. Looks like something like that. They don't look like Arabs to me. Something about the body language. -They walk like Jews. -How do Jews walk? -Can you spot an Arab? -I can spot most Arabs. -And I can spot Jews. -Okay, keep me posted. -They're not Arabs. -How can you tell? An Arab knows an Arab. Do they look like Arabs to you? Then what do they look like? -They are settlers. -Come on, they look like settlers? No kippah, no tassels, how could they be settlers? I mean radical Jews, not necessarily religious. Tell him. I understand. But Hussein, we have to be clear on this. This is a police investigation. You say settlers, we take you seriously, we look into the settler angle, but look, these guys aren't settlers. -Tell me, did your son speak Hebrew? -No, he's a kid, of course he didn't. Then how can they be talking to him if he doesn't speak Hebrew? What are they talking about? It looks like they know him, doesn't it? They're settlers. Why would Arabs kidnap my son? You tell me. Like that cousin of yours that ran over the Zaher boy. Maybe someone was seeking revenge through you. What? That was a long time ago. And he's not my cousin. There are 6,000 Abu Khdeirs. -What do I care about that? -Then who could it be? It can't be Arabs. -Think. -It's not Arabs. Enough! -Where is Khaled? -I don't know. He was here. Cowards, you left Mohammed alone. -Iyad, Iyad. -Let go. -Come on. -Let go. Please, let him go, he's Mohammed Abu Khdeir's brother! He's Mohammed's brother! Let him go. I told Itzik everything I know. I'll tell you what happened this morning so you know how serious this is. We found the body of an Arab boy. A burnt body. He was set on fire. A 16-year-old. The body was found in Jerusalem Forest, he was kidnapped from Shu'afat. We have footage of the kidnapping. But we can't say for sure that Jews did it. It's obvious it was Jews. Why? Because revenge is natural. I'm not saying I know who did it, but it's a given. Most people I talk to say it couldn't be Jews. Then they're wrong. That's part of the problem. That you assume Jews are incapable of cruelty towards their enemy. A 16-year-old boy. He never harmed a soul. -Who do you think did it? -I have no idea. It could be one of ours. Maybe someone who was fed up after our boys' bodies were found. And it could be someone who just snapped. Thank God, "The people of Israel have not been forsaken." Is that it? For now. The reason I'm talking to you is because it doesn't matter. I'm a small fry. There are thousands like me. The reason you're talking to us is because you're a loser. A spoiled brat who cracked after a month in prison. We do not believe in the rule of heretics We do not believe Their laws mean nothing to us Nothing We shall follow the Torah -Excuse me? -Yes, Mr. Abu Khdeir? I want my phone back, I want to talk to my family. -Enough is enough. -I'll look into it. -Wait here, okay? -No, it's not okay. You took my phone and said you'd give it back. -You're right. -But you didn't give it back. I said I'll look into it. Please wait in the room. Thank you. "The Open House mourns the murder of our friend Mohammed Abu Khdeir," "may God have mercy on his soul, who was murdered by backward primitives." "Dear Mohammed joins a long list of LGBT victims," "such as our beloved friend Adam Russo, who was stabbed by Yishai Shlisel" "and our friends who were murdered..." He's gay? Is this for real? "We pray that Mohammed will be the last victim" "and that we'll be able to protect the members of our community." Wait, there's something else. Photos we got off his friend's phone. Khaled Raof. It's all over the Internet and the media is buzzing too. Let's do a deep check on this. It looks credible to me... It's as credible as our arrest of Arab suspects... Then go ahead, disprove it. I'm looking at these pictures, at the Open House post, at the very least it demands a thorough examination. Wait. Apparently there's a social worker who a week ago reported a boy named Abu Khdeir who claimed he is being threatened because of his sexual orientation. Let's go. Either we confirm it, or find out who's spreading disinformation... If I were to write something it could have looked like this, but I didn't write it. I don't know the name either, but I can check with our coordinators and volunteers, maybe it came from them. I saw the picture online, I recognized him right away. He was here two days ago with his friend, Khaled. I think he said they dance the dabke together. I'm sure about Abu Khdeir, I'm not sure about the first name. Either Ahmad or Mohammed. He sounded very stressed out, he spoke in a whisper. He begged us to help him, said his family was threatening him because they found out he's gay. What can we do about it? In their sector they refuse to cooperate with us in these matters. I connected all that with what happened this morning and called the police right away. Look, I... I spoke with him less than a minute. He was nice, a little shy, he didn't say a word. They were afraid to speak Arabic in public. He left his cap. It's a very sensitive subject in the Arab sector and if he's gay, or was gay, it's likely his family and friends didn't know about it. I LOVE TOTO
