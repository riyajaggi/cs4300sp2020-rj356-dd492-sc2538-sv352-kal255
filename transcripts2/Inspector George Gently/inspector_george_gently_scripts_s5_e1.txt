 Inspector George Gently (2007â€“2017): Season 5, Episode 1 - Gently Northern Soul - full transcript 
 This episode sees the racial unrest that is sweeping the United States reach British shores as Enoch Powell launches his tirade against immigration. But racial harmony can be found at the 'all-nighters' that take place in 1968, where disillusioned young people, black and white, escape the boredom of factory life to dance the night away to imported soul music. In Newcastle, the haven of equality found at the Carlton Ballroom all-nighter is destroyed when a young black girl, Dolores Kenny, is murdered, leading Gently to uncover a disturbing and racialist undercurrent growing within the local community.

 I'll turn a blind eye this time since it's you, eh? I hope you two girls are going to enjoy yourselves tonight. And er, be careful, right? Oh, and er, save the last dance, girls, yeah? Who found the body? A man from the local estate. Down there. Working girl. Why? This place is famous for it. Blow to the side of the head. But it wasn't robbery. Huh? Have you got an evidence bag? Tom, Tom. Evidence bag. 20 quid.

 Why did he kill her then? Who? The trick. You know, the punter. Too drunk to finish the business. She laughed at him, mebbies, and he got angry. So why didn't he take his money back? Can't be many coloured girls in this area. She shouldn't be too hard to identify. I'll ask around. There's plenty of men who'd pay extra for a bit of exotic. I want her name on my desk by nine o'clock tomorrow morning. Righto. Enjoy your Sunday. Dolores Kenny. 35 Gale Street, Whitley Bay. Thank you very much. My guess is she picked up a client in town, and then drove out to Byker to, er, you know. Traces of carbolic soap found on her neck. And? No sign of recent sexual activity. Some prostitute. No, no, no, no. It just means they hadn't got that far, that's all. He's a bus conductor, sir. Originally from Trinidad and Tobago. Is your father home? Thank you. The wife? RAF. Mmm. Ambrose Kenny? I'm Chief Inspector Gently. This is Detective Sergeant Bacchus. You have a daughter named Dorothy, yes? Dolores. I'm... I'm afraid we've got some bad news. She was found dead yesterday on some waste ground in Byker. What happened? We think she was killed by a blow to the head. I would like to say how very sorry we are. He didn't even know she name. I... Sorry. Is there anything that you can tell us that might help explain the circumstances of Dolores's death? She take she own life? No. There's no suggestion of that. Then let me call this thing by its name, no? Murder. Can you think of anybody who would have wanted to harm her? Sorry, can I ask why you're laughing? Perhaps it was one of the men who spat at her on the bus last week and told her to get back to the jungle. Or maybe the woman who wouldn't let her touch her washing in the launderette, or the kids... Joseph! Enough. Someone specific. No. Did she have a boyfriend? She was a good girl. That's not what the sergeant asked. No. Where was she on Saturday night? All dressed up. She was go dancing with a friend. Is that what she told you? Aye, because that's what she did. What's the name of her friend? Carol. Carol Morford. Them's work at the launderette together. Them is like sisters. Can we see Dolores's room? I didn't know that there were coloureds in the RAF during the war. What was he, do you reckon? Ground crew, maybe? He was a pilot. Wellington bomber. 90 missions over Germany. Anything else you'd like to know? A little more about your sister and her friend, Carol. Where did they go dancing together? They went to the Carlton. The Carlton? Ballroom dancing? For the all-nighters. What? Northern Soul. Come again? Is this Carol? Dolores had a lot of money on her. Twenty quid. Do you have any idea where that might have come from? She'd been saving her wages to buy records. They trade singles at the club. You admired Dr King, I imagine? Aye. We all did. Yeah, me too. The policeman who approves of civil disobedience? A policeman who approves of non-violence. We'll be in touch as soon as we have any information. Try and get the name right next time. There's more money in her drawer. You don't get that working in a launderette, selling records in a dance hall. Do you? These all-night Northern Soul type things, sir. They're not organised by the ballroom. They just hire it out. Who to? A bloke called Gary Watts. All right. Let's have a word with him and then Dolores's friend Carol. I want to find out where Dolores was getting all this money from. OK. Maybe some of their tricks. Where do I find this bloke Watts? This is his head office, sir. Very good. There you go, love. Thanks very much. It looks lovely. Should keep the old man's strength up, eh? Thank you. All right. Bye. Ta-ra. Gary Watts? I'd like to ask you a few questions about a regular at your soul nights, Dolores Kenny? She was found dead yesterday. Shame. She might have been at the Carlton on Saturday. Did you see her? I've seen her about. Hard to miss, really. Tell me about Northern Soul. Well, we give them a kind of soul music they don't play anywhere else. They come from all over the place. London, Scotland. They're obsessed by it. Don't know why, like. It's all like jigaboo to me, but there you go, they love it. And it makes me money. What about Carol Morford? She might have been there. I don't know. Her father told me that you and Dolores Kenny were close, like sisters. Ambrose looked out for us. Me dad went back to Ireland and me mam, well, she only had time for church, so I spent a lot of time at their house. Can you tell me what you remember about that Saturday night? Just a normal night. Which was...? Dancing. Drinking? No. No alcohol allowed. She had quite a lot of money on her. Any idea where that came from? I didn't realise Dolores was the criminal here. I thought she was the victim. Well, did she have a boyfriend? Was she seeing anybody? If I'm going to find out what happened to her, I need to know what kind of person she was. She was beautiful. Inside and out. Nothing from the door to door, guv. What about the working girls? Ah, well, the ones that are still awake at this time. They've never heard of Dolores Kenny. Mmm. See, I think Dolores Kenny met her killer at this Northern, what is it? Northern Soul. Soul. They dance all night. They're not allowed booze. So how do they keep going? Pills. Exactly. Watts. What? Gary Watts. The fishmonger. What? What's the name of the bloke we've been trying to put away for years? You know. Protection, and money lending and that? You mean Bernie Watts? Bernie Watts. How old's Gary? 30-something. Could be his son? Yeah, OK. He's been selling pills to his audience, right? Maybe Dolores Kenny was working for him? And that's how she got the money. Eh? She's coloured, so she must be on the game. She's got money, so she's selling drugs? I thought it might flush somebody out. A trick, mebbies. Joseph Kenny here to see you, sir. Before you say it, let me... This arrived, addressed to me dad. Delivered by hand. "Dear Mr Kenny. "I'm so happy your wog daughter's dead. "Now go back to where you came from." Pay no attention to it, Joseph. Somebody saw an opportunity to hurt you and your dad. Please don't let them. Yeah... Why should any of us trust any of you? Sometimes I wonder. Written on an Underwood. On headed stationery? Granthorn Social Club. Whoever wrote it isn't exactly the brightest, is he? Huh? You think it's the killer? "Come to this address and arrest us". No, come on, guv. Guv, it's a waste of time. We should let them know how we feel about having our time wasted. Do you recognise this stationery? Aye, son. It's the club's letterhead. And who would have access to that? Only me. But that's nae good. It's out of date. The committee's changed the lettering. Look, I'll show you. What did you do with the old stationery? Well, I didn't like to see nowt wasted. But I think I left it at my old digs. Yes, we had Alfred here for six months. Wasn't ideal, but I felt sorry for the old gent. I made sure he had most of his meals in his room. Who's up there now? Mr Tate, till next week. I take in theatricals and they do tend to come and go. Yes, we've had all the greats staying here over the years. We've had Dickie Henderson, Jimmy Clitheroe, Frank Ifield. I do wish he'd stop that yodelling though, don't you? Is that you? Were you in the business? Ten seasons at the Tivoli Theatre of Varieties. When did Mr Tate move in? Sunday. He's a regular. A vent. Ventriloquist. Who else is here this weekend? Two Dundonians. Contortionists. Incredible what they can achieve on a diet of black pudding and neat vodka. Alfred said he left some belongings. Oh? Such as? Stationery. We're trying to trace a letter. No. I can't say I recall anything like that. Beautiful birds. How many you got? Eight English budgies. Three American. Pair of lovebirds, a parakeet and a cockatiel. A parakeet and a cockatiel in the same cage? Birds don't cross-breed. Not like people. They're only attracted to their own species. I thought the human race WAS one species? Sorry I couldn't have been more help. No. Not at all. Thanks for your time. That your typewriter? Yes. My father bought it for me, years ago. It's just gathering dust now. It's an Underwood, isn't it? Yes. Do you know the Kennys? Can't say I do. No. Why did you do it, Matilda? Do what? Write that letter. I didn't write any letter. You've got a sign in the window saying no blacks. Are you telling me you haven't noticed a coloured family two streets away? On top of which, you've got the same make of typewriter the letter was written on and the same paper used on your noticeboard. My only crime is to want things back the way they were. Before all this immigration. When you knew who your neighbour was. Nowadays, look at us. Just like a nation of strangers. When the Race Relations Bill passes, that sign there will be illegal. So let me do you a favour. If I find that you've been turning away coloured people, I'll close you down. Do we understand each other? Ambrose Kenny. What about him? Why not him? Your thinking behind that? He found out she was on drugs. And he gave her a good old slap, no? And he got carried away. Dolores was found miles away from home, Ambrose hasn't got a car. But she was only a mile away from the Carlton dance hall. That's where we need to be. Or, to be more specific, that's where YOU need to be. Priceless, isn't it? Haven't you got a job to go to? Sir. Oi! Oi! Are you laughing at me? Is he laughing at me? No, no. I want double time for this. Oh, you'll need these. What? You've got to take your own records? They buy and sell them, remember. Help make you look a bit more believable. Or slightly less unbelievable. Don't be a wallflower. We want in! We want in! We want in! We want in! We want in! We want in! We want in... The pathologist's full report, sir. What you got, pet? Orangeade, or orangeade. Orangeade then, please. Thank you. Do you want to deal, mate? What? Do you want to deal? No. OK. Hello, pet. Want to buy a single? Nah. You're all right, thanks. I'd ask you to dance but I've twisted me ankle. You're in luck. I'm not in the mood. Oh, aye? Why's that? Just. Here you are, look. "Born A Loser". It's my theme tune, that. Go on. Make an offer. 10 bob. Sold. I'm just kidding. You get 15 quid for that. Really? Yeah. No, it's worth it to get to talk to you. My name's Jim. Carol. I've not seen you here before. I've just moved back up from Leeds. You like Don Ray then? Yeah. I prefer Frank Wilson. Do I Love You? Indeed I Do. It's my friend's favourite. Is it? Well, it was nice to meet you, Jim. Right. Charlie, I need to speak to you... Charlie! There is something I need to tell you, Mr Kenny. Ambrose, please. Ambrose. Your daughter was three months pregnant when she died. You didn't know. Any idea who the father might be? You didn't know this? So she did have a relationship. Despite what you said last time. What are you reading this for? Put it away. You will learn nothing but hate from these men. They'll make things worse, not better. We must change the way people see us. Is that why you're drinking yourself to sleep every night? Hmmm? Do you think you'll wake up white? You see these Black Panthers? They have all the questions and none of the answers. They want to build a black nation for black people. As Dr King said... Dr King is dead. We need to become the masters of our own destiny. Look, some may not like it but we are a part of this country. No, we're not. And if we don't help ourselves, who will? Him? This man is a guest in our house. A guest is someone you invite. Enough! They're going to let the man who killed your daughter walk away, and you're just going to stand there and do nothing. You never fought for anything in your life, did you? You even let your own wife walk away without a fight. Oi. Don't take the micky, bonny lad. Cos I'll cave your face in. What are you looking at? Ah, nothing. Just... I wouldn't mind a few of them myself, actually. A few of what? You know, the um... No bother. You just enjoy the music. All right. No offence. Y'all right? All right? Do you mind if I have a look? Yeah. Thanks. Ah, you got some good 'uns here. One of them cost 15 quid. 15 quid! Which one's that? The Contours. Just A Little Misunderstanding. Original label. I'd have that round me neck if I were you. It's a bit of a funny atmosphere tonight, don't you think? Suppose. Yeah. There was that girl that was found dead last Saturday, about a mile away. Hey. Leave them. Hey. Your wages. Ten bob. Well, darkie'll do it for half price. No. I said leave them! Charlie. It's just monkey music, yeah? Relax. Eh? I don't want your pills. What have I told you?! Hey! Leave him. Get off, man! Hey. All right, All right. I don't want any trouble. Just leave him alone. Friend of his? No. She's gone, little brother. Gone. Life goes on. Thanks. You shouldn't have got involved. No bother. What was it all about? They work for me dad. He's happy to see Gary cash in on Philly Soul, you're just not supposed to enjoy it. Charlie Watts. Jim. Jim Thomas. Is Gary your brother? Yeah. Hey, who was the lass in the green dress? Carol? Aye, Carol. Do you fancy her? Ah, no. Not if she's yours I don't. You all right? Yeah. Yeah, it's nothing. So how do you know Carol then? I was going out with her best mate. Dolores. My dad didn't like it. If he calmed down a bit, he'd be a Nazi. Oh, I see. My brother's the same. Can I ask, was Dolores the girl that...? You know... Why do you keep asking about her? No reason, no reason. Sorry. I could do with a drink, I think. Orangeade. Do you want one? No. I'll just stay here. All right. Hello? Gary Watts is dealing, I've just met him. Aye, he's a lovely fella. Hey, guess what? You'll like this. It's a family affair. Dolores had a boyfriend. Gary's brother, Charlie. She was seeing Bernie Watts' son? 'Aye.' 'Well done, John. So what happens...?' Hey. You're not away are you, pet? I was hoping for a dance. I thought you twisted your ankle? Mebbies a slow one, then. Sorry. You've caught us on a bad night. That's what they all say. I was hoping I might have impressed you the way I smacked the side of my face into that bloke's forehead. Wasn't expecting that, was he? No, he wasn't. You had him up against the ropes right enough. Aye. That's what I thought. Terrified, he was. No, I better go. Ah, go on. Just the one. I promise I won't try any funny business. Well, then, I'm definitely off. Think of me as one of those blokes back from the trenches. You know. It's your duty. You all right? Looks like you've been crying. I'm just upset about my friend Dolores. Ah. Is that the girl that was found the other night? Aye. I'm sorry. Was she a good friend? The best. Can I ask? Do you not feel scared about coming back after what happened? Why would I be? Nobody here would have harmed Dolores. They don't care about the colour of your skin. Most of their heroes are black. No, it couldn't have been one of the regulars, no way. Mebbies it wasn't a regular. Like you, you mean? I'm joking. No. Dolores wouldn't have wanted me to stop coming here. This place meant the world to us. You're a much better dancer than I thought you'd be. For a cripple. Do you want to go somewhere quiet? All right. This place made Dolores forget about her boring job, her dad, about everything. Her dad? Aye. He didn't like her seeing lads. We had this mad dream about going to America. To the clubs in Philadelphia and Detroit. She thought she'd meet some big record producer. She could sing, you see. She could sing like Aretha. What about you? Can you sing? Not like Dolores. No. I was going to be her manager. We'd nearly saved up enough. Did her dad know about that? Oh, no. He'd have gone nuts. So, what do you think happened to her? I wish I knew. Have the coppers seen you? She's just another wog to the cops. You should hear some of the names they call us. Which way you going? This way. I'll give you a lift if you like? Oh, no, it's all right. I'm going for a swim. A quick dip and a cup of coffee and I'm ready to face the world. All right, see you later. See you. Want to keep us company? I don't usually carry me trunks with us. You can hire them at the baths. Aye, all right. Selling scrap, mate? Bernie Watts around? I never met the lass. I can't say I'm glad she's dead, but I am glad Charlie isn't going to end up with her. I told him it's all right for a bit of fun but you don't want to be bringing one home. Did he listen to you? Well, they finished a while back. So yeah, I think he did. He's a good boy really. She was pregnant. You think my lad had summat to do with that? You know what they're like. She was probably putting it about all over. We need to stop this Race Relations Bill and end immigration. Half the world thinks they're British. Where were you Saturday night? You think I killed her? I'm a businessman. My personal feelings come second to my desire to make money. A desire shared by your other son Gary. The one who sells drugs to the dancers. Now, you might as well be talking Swahili, Inspector. Where were you Saturday night? I was here. Anybody with you? Tell the Inspector where you were last Saturday. Having a few pints with you, Bernie. Not sure about these trunks. I don't know where they've been. Jump in, the water's lovely! It's like the North Pole in there. Don't be such a big jessie! Me and Dolores used to come here every morning after an all-nighter. With Charlie? Aye. And Gary? No. Well, yeah, sometimes, but he'd just sit and watch. He always gave me the creeps. Charlie said we'd never get the smell of the fish out of the water if he did come in. He used to give him carbolic soap for his birthday! Gary sells fish. He's got sole, just the wrong kind. Oi! I'd better go. I'll come with you. No, you're all right. You finish your swim. Will I see you next week at the club? Maybe. What time do you call this? I've been for a dip with Carol. Dolores's mate. That's what they do, they go swimming after. You know, they know how to have a good time down there. I could really, really get into that Philly Soul. It's amazing. Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. What's the... Don't worry. It was just a bit of a scuffle. So, you feel like telling me what else you found out? Yes, sorry. Gary Watts. Uses carbolic soap to get rid of the smell of fish off his hands. Yeah, you sure? Aye, positive. Yeah. Is that how the soap got on her neck? Cos he had a thing for her. What? Gary got her pregnant? Gary, who thinks it's all jigaboo music? Well, Carol says that he was always hanging round her, even though it was his brother Charlie that was going out with her. Yeah, well, like you said, it's a family affair. What else? Oh, er... Carol said that Dolores and her had enough money to get them both to America. Money coming from where, do you think? Don't know, she didn't say. She doesn't go all the way on a first date then. Is she selling drugs for Gary? No. Not Carol. Not Carol? No, no definitely not, no. Dolores, she was in the driving seat. Oh, and it turns out that Bernie Watts wasn't the only person who didn't approve of Charlie and Dolores's, you know... Carol says that Ambrose wasn't too happy about her seeing any lads. He lied to us. Point taken. Thank you. Get Gary and Charlie in. Gary first. I know you've been dealing at the club. I've got a witness. Were you working for your dad? No. I also pulled your file. Seems you've got a bit of a nasty streak, Gary. Two convictions for assault. Dishonourably discharged from the army for attacking an officer. Anything else I should know about? Did you know that Dolores was pregnant? You had a thing for her, didn't you? I'm married. Now why would I be shagging her? As your dad says, as long as you don't bring them home. You use carbolic to get rid of the smell of the fish, don't you? Who's telling you all this rubbish, eh? Do you or don't you? So? Traces of the same soap were found on Dolores. On her neck. Well, maybe she used it as well. No. Girls usually prefer something scented. Maybe she couldn't afford Yardley's. Were you seeing Dolores? No chance. The name's Gary, not Charlie. What else were you doing for your father apart from selling drugs? Getting rid of unwanted girlfriends? You'd better start telling me the truth about you and Dolores or I'll do you for drug dealing right now. I might have touched her neck. You might have touched her neck? When she kissed me. When did this happen? Outside the club. You left with her? She was upset. She'd had an argument or summat with Charlie. I went to see if she was all right. We kissed goodnight and I went back inside the club. How long were you gone? Five minutes. 'He's lying. He fancied her.' He's got a face like a butcher's chopping block. It's jealousy. Good-looking Charlie got her instead. So he smashed her skull in, stuck her in the back of the van, went back to the club, dumped her later. And what happened to your theory about Ambrose? Sir. What? Charlie Watts is here. All right. Get a search warrant for Gary's fish van. And speak to Carol again. I need to know who was the father of Dolores's baby. Surely she told her best friend? And if not, why not? I need to know what's going on between the four of them. I'll sleep when I'm dead, shall I? How did you feel about being a dad, Charlie? Not thrilled? Is that what you and Dolores fought about the night she died? You have a clear motive for killing her. What motive? Jealousy. I've seen it send men to the gallows. Gary kissed her the night she died. But you knew that, didn't you? Did she get bored with you and then move on to your big brother? He told me he was having her. Oh? Is that what the row was about? She left. Gary went after her to comfort her? You saw them kissing. You waited for Gary to leave. Did you kill her, Charlie? No. I didn't. Hello? What are you doing here? Looking for you. How'd you know I worked here? I asked around. You're keen. I couldn't wait till the next all-nighter. I wanted to see you. Can I take you for lunch? I've already got my lunch. I can do better than a soggy cheese sandwich. Soggy cheese sandwich and chips. Were you aware that Dolores was saving up to leave for America? I found this in she room. She said she'd saved it from she wages. Well, she might have got it selling drugs at the club. Did she ever mention a Gary Watts? Do you think he killed her? That is the father of the child? We don't know. But she did have another boyfriend. Charlie Watts. His brother. But surely you knew that, didn't you, Ambrose? I don't know anything. Come on, Ambrose. You've got a daughter who seems to have two white boyfriends. Brothers. Whose father, Bernie Watts, is one of the worst racialist bigots in the country. Plus she might have been in with them selling drugs. And you say you didn't know? Here you are, cheese and onion toastie. Don't say I don't spoil you. Where's my chips? They don't do chips, sorry about that. Beer's got a head on it, though. Ooh. You really know how to sweep a girl off her feet, don't you? If you play your cards right I'll take you to the burger van in King Street next time. So you're not working today? No, no I got a day off. I'm in the building trade. Only work when it's sunny. That's why I moved back to the north east. I'm a lazy bugger. Right. Mmmm... Your toastie's getting cold. I'm not really hungry. Not had much of an appetite since Dolores was killed. Do they have any idea who did it yet? No, not that I've heard. Maybe she had another lad on the go. An older man. Summat like that, maybe? Plenty men won't admit it, but they like a bit of summat different on the side. And what's that supposed to mean? Huh? Nothing. And Dolores would just go along with that, would she? Is that because black girls just like a good shag? And they're up for it? They go like bunnies? Is that what you mean? I didn't mean it like that. Just thinking out loud. No. You weren't thinking, that's the problem. Nobody had a reason to kill her. Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. Honestly, I don't want you thinking I'm some narrow-minded idiot. I really don't. Everybody's allowed to make one mistake. Just the one, mind. We're having a vigil for Dolores tomorrow at the Carlton. Would you like to come? What was it like when you came here from Trinidad and Tobago? Why? Why you want to know? I've got an enquiring mind. Comes with the job. It was raining. 1940. I trained as a wireless operator, then I was an air gunner. And then after 30 missions you're entitled to a job on the ground. But I wanted to fly. So I retrained as a pilot. Do a lot of low-level flying. After the war I met my wife. She was an army nurse. Well, we just decided to stay. We feel at home. What went wrong with you and the wife? She wanted more from life than I could give her. I just realised how much like she mother Dolores was. Did you argue with Dolores about that money you found? Did you? Look, I understand this must be difficult for you, Ambrose. You feel rejected by the country that you fought for. I didn't say that. No. But it's what you really feel isn't it? Deep down. Now you find that your own daughter doesn't respect you either. She lies. She gets pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father is. So you snap. You lose control. All that anger comes flooding out. And you said yourself, she's just like your wife. Enough! You are not a father. Are you? Nice cup of tea, and a biscuit. There you are. How'd you get on? Yeah, no, it was, er... I didn't find out much about who the father was. I don't think she knows. But I did get invited to a vigil they're holding for Dolores tomorrow at the Carlton. Don't worry, I made my excuses. RAF records office. The war record of Ambrose Kenny. I asked for it. Why? Because his son couldn't stay in the same room with him when Ambrose told me about his war record. What does that mean? What it means, John, is that he made the whole thing up. He was a clerk in the stores. Why? Why do you need to do that? Is this the cup final and nobody told me? 'Two of them married now, with family. 'I shan't be satisfied till I have seen them all settled overseas. 'In this country, in 15 or 20 years' time, 'the black man will have the whip hand over the white man. 'Well, I can already hear the chorus of execration. 'How dare I say such a horrible thing? 'How dare I stir up trouble and inflame feelings 'by repeating such a conversation? 'My answer is that I do not have the right NOT to do so. 'It almost passes belief that, 'at this moment, 20 to 30 additional immigrant children 'are arriving from overseas in Wolverhampton alone every week. 'And that means 15 or 20 additional families 'a decade or so hence. 'Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad. 'We must be mad, literally mad, as a nation 'to be permitting the annual inflow 'of some 50,000 dependants, 'who are, for the most part, the material of the future growth...' About time somebody said it. '..of the immigrant descended population.' We have lift off. 'It is like watching a nation busily engaged 'in heaping up its own funeral pyre. 'In these circumstances, nothing will suffice...' OK. Get back to work. All of you. That's all this country needs. Inspector Gently, can I have a few words about the Dolores Kenny case please? It's ongoing. That's all I can say at the moment. Well, how long was she on the game? Should other prostitutes in the area be worried? Dolores Kenny was not a prostitute. And if anybody has any information about what happened to her I'd like them to come forward. If they could imagine for just one moment it was their daughter how would they feel? Would you like me to repeat any of that? No, no, that's fine. Before we have a moment's silence for Dolores, her dad would like to say a few words. Nobody could want a better daughter than Dolores. She was strong-willed, but I don't have to tell you that. She was also kind, generous. She friends tell me she had a wonderful singing voice. But she had a future. She has been taken away from us by hatred. And that does make you want to hate. I don't know why she died. I probably never will. But she killer, he cannot take away our humanity, unless we give it to him. I once fought in a war. I see a lot of death. So now there is no reason why I want to go outside there and kill somebody. It's like Dr King and all them does say. "You have to fight the hate". So come. Let us pray. Get out! Stop it. Stop it now! Gary! Joseph! What are you doing here? It's fine. I'll sort it. Just stay here. Promise me. Look, I can't see Joseph! Enough! Stop it! Get him! You want some scars, son? Like your friends from Africa? Hit him! Will that make you happy? You need to remember who your people are, son. 'Ey, 'ey, it's me, man! We got a dead man up here! Settle down! Settle down! Look at me. Look at me, son. You were fighting. You admit to fighting. Who did that to you? Where do you live? Settle down! Will you settle down?! You OK? Yeah. Listen, thanks for, erm... What happened to Charlie Watts? We haven't got him. Don't know, must have done a runner. Oh, brilliant! Get men watching for him at his flat and the scrapyard. You do understand that this could ruin your life? Do you want your father to lose both his children? I'm not going to confess to something I didn't do, no matter what you do to me. And what am I going to do to you? Maybe I'll accidentally fall down the stairs. Well, I don't need to push you down a flight of stairs, Joseph, because I've got the knife. Then check it for fingerprints. Yeah. And it's been wiped clean. I wonder if you knew that already. I'm glad he's dead. Why? Because he killed Dolores. How do you know that? I saw them outside the club together. Dolores... Dolores. Hey! What's wrong? What's the matter? Just talk to me. I'm here for you. What are you doing here? Taking you home. Can't you see these white boys are using you? How long will they stay when people spit at them? I'm having a baby. Don't know what to do. Which one's the father? It's Charlie's. How do you know? Joe. I don't need your anger. I need your help. You're just like your mother. 'You left her alone in the middle of the night?' Why didn't you tell me this before? I felt ashamed. I felt... responsible. Can I go home now? No. No, you can't. I need to speak to this witness, in private. My name is John. I'm a Detective Sergeant, and I was working undercover on Dolores's murder. Can I go now? No, don't. You not finished lying to me yet? You not finished using me? Jim. I was just trying to find out what happened to Dolores. If you'd known I was a copper you'd never have spoken to us. That makes it all right, does it? I don't know. That's for you to decide. You know, if I thought you cared... if I thought any of you really cared about Dolores - I'd understand. I didn't know Dolores. But I do want justice for her. For you. I want you to believe me. I told you not to get involved! Huh? First you go swimming with her, next you're snogging her on police premises! You told me not to be a wallflower. She could have been playing you for a fool. She could have been feeding you false information. But she didn't. How serious is it? Well, I hope you are prepared for the stick you'll get. It would be career suicide. Now, I'm not saying it's right, it's just a fact. It won't get that far. Well, from what I just saw, it already has. She thinks policemen are all bigots. Well - she's got a point, hasn't she? You've been prejudiced since this case started. You thought Dolores was just a bit of exotic, didn't you? Not even worth the bother of getting her name right. A swim and a kiss. That changes you for ever, does it? What about you, sir? Eh? Bending over backwards to believe every single word Ambrose Kenny says. And hey, what does he turn out to be? Biggles of the stores! Ambrose Kenny's downstairs, sir. It was me, I do it. I killed him. I kill him. He took my daughter's life. So I take his. Sit down, Mr Kenny. I don't want to sit down. So this knife, the murder weapon, is your knife? No. I find it on the floor, I just pick it up and I stab Gary Watts. What if I said that you're afraid that Joseph stabbed Gary Watts and you're taking the blame? You would be wrong. All right, so how many times did you stab him? I can't remember. Self-sacrifice is to be admired. Not in this case. Don't talk to me about self-sacrifice. I fought for the mother country, this country ever fight for me? Well, that's not strictly speaking true, is it? What do you mean by that? "Ambrose Kenny, storeman. "September 1942, applied for training as a rear gunner. "Application denied. "January 1943, applied for training as a rear gunner. "Application denied." June 1943, same again. And again. And again. And again! Why'd you make up this pack of lies? Same reason you came here today, isn't it? For your children. One black person is welcome in. It's when there's more than one, that's when you people change. It's a gradual thing. I watched it happening. You start to feel threatened. And then one day your children, they come home from school... and they tell you people start to spit at them. You get to watch the pain in their eyes, because they don't understand why people would say you don't belong here. You is a nobody, you come from a nobody family and your father is just a bus conductor and you're a nobody! So one day you start to tell a story. It might give them a little piece of pride. So, yes. I buy these medals in a junk shop. I'm not a father, as you pointed out. But I hope I would have had the courage to do the same. Sir, Charlie Watts has been seen at the scrapyard. You wait here, right? Jim. What are you doing here? Sorry, Charlie. It's John. I need you to come with me. All right, don't worry. This way. Yeah. I need to talk to you. Why did you bring Charlie back in? He's already answered your questions. No, he hasn't. We don't know where he was when Gary was murdered. We also can't account for his movements on the night that Dolores died. You don't understand. He couldn't have killed her. I know it's hard to believe but, you know, sometimes people just act out of character. He couldn't have done it. Why are you so sure? Because I know where he was. He was with me. Seen Charlie? She thinks the world of you, honestly. Dolores? You all right, pet? You had it away with your best mate's boyfriend while she was pregnant? It was just a kiss. Charlie used me to make her jealous. He thought she'd been seeing Gary. That's why he won't say where he was, and I begged him not to. Joseph and Ambrose are like family to me. I couldn't stand it if they knew it was my fault. Have you told your dad about Carol yet? Have you? I feel sorry for him, mate, I really do. He thinks he's got rid of one unsuitable girlfriend, and now you go and get yourself another one. John... What are black girls to you, just fair game? That's enough! Huh? Go on. Admit it. Admit it. You killed Dolores. You cough to that, they might take it easy on you. Crime of passion, they'll call it. In France you wouldn't even get a fine. Go on, admit it! Oi! I said that's enough! I loved Dolores from the moment I laid eyes on her. She was the most beautiful girl I'd ever met. I should've believed her... but I believed Gary instead. He said he'd been shagging her. I was jealous. Angry. I kissed Carol to get back at Dolores. And Gary? Did you kill him? There's no point in lying, Charlie. Because we got the murder weapon. And guess what? It's covered in fingerprints. You're lying. How can you be so sure? Eh? Is it because you know that the knife was wiped, because you wiped it? Gary! Gary! I know what you did. It was your baby, wasn't it? Wasn't it? Dad didn't want a little brown baby called Watts, now, did he? No, Charlie, Charlie. I lied about that, OK. I never touched Dolores. She wouldn't let me. It was your baby all along, Charlie. I just, I just said it to split yous up. So it was my baby? Yeah. It was my baby. You killed her? It wasn't me, Charlie. I swear it. It wasn't me. 'He didn't kill her.' But it's his fault she's dead. His and mine. Then who did kill her? Joseph? Leave us alone! Joseph... Who killed my son? His brother. No. He's not thinking straight. You made him say that. You're going to let that black lad get away with killing a white lad. You turned your sons against each other, Bernie. Poisoned them. You poisoned your own family. No. They were both good boys. Charlie confessed to it five minutes ago. Right. Time for the truth, Bernie. Did you kill Dolores Kenny? I hated her. I gave her 20 quid to get rid of the baby. She took it. So what reason did I have to kill her? Come out, you coon! Come out! Out! Go upstairs and lock yourself in the bathroom. Joseph, you're not going out there. They'll kill you. Just go and hide! No! We know you're in there, you know! Are we going to do this? Come on. Open the door! Come on. Come on! Who do this? You did. Huh? If you'd stopped her seeing a white boy in the first place, this wouldn't have happened! How I could tell her not to see a boy because of the colour of his skin? If I do that that make me the same as the people who come and do this! You couldn't see what was going to happen, could you? When you going to realise? When YOU going to realise - they don't want us! Not all of them, Joseph. It's not all of them. I don't believe that. Oh, aye. But you believed I was capable of murder? You believed that? Didn't you? You can't blame me for that? I mean, look at you. You're so full of anger. And you should be too. Joseph... You can't see. I just tried to protect you! Aye. Like how you protected Dolores? Sarge, another friend to see you. Mr Bacchus? Listen, I don't want to get anybody in trouble, you know, especially not myself. I've got a living to earn and its not like you lot make it easy for girls like me. Get on with it. I read what you said in the paper, you know, about that lass who died on Saturday night. About how we should imagine they were our own daughter. My customer was driving us in his van to the waste ground where I work. Well, he'd had a few and he was driving too fast. And I felt this thud right next to me. I didn't know what was going on. So we pulled over. It was pitch black out there. There was something in the road. He said we'd hit a dog, but I knew he was lying. It was that lass out of the paper. 'He said she was dead. 'But she wasn't. There was still breath in her.' And he wouldn't go for an ambulance. He just dragged her over to that ditch and left her there. Ambrose, what are you doing? Joseph, call the police. 'We had hit her hard.' There was blood on the side mirror and the side of her head was bashed in. But still I told him, "You have to get help. "You can't just leave her like that." Sir... Minute. Minute. He said... He said, "What does it matter? She's just a coloured." Dad... Dad! You should walk away, if you know what's good for you. Move. You take my daughter's life. Not true. You think you can live while she lying in the ground? That's what you think? Dad? What are you doing? Wait a minute. I didn't kill anyone. Dad, don't! Shut your mouth! I didn't lay a hand on her. Dad! Ambrose. Move! Ambrose. Listen to me, please. Nobody murdered her. Not Bernie, not Gary. It was a hit and run. You expect me to believe that? Joseph and Dolores argued that night. Yes? Yeah, we did. He's telling the truth. She walked home in the dark. She was hit on the side of the head. The driver was drunk and he didn't report it. It was him that caused it. Not that! He left her to die in a ditch. You think he would have done that if she was white? Dad, stop! Ambrose! All my life, I try and do the right thing. I was brought up well. So I take all the abuse. I listen to all your nasty racist jokes even though I can see the hatred behind your eyes. My son is not going through what I went through. Joseph! I wanted you to fight back, but not like this. I wanted you to stand up for yourself, to be someone I could admire. And you are. You are. I love you. Dolores, she loves you. You don't need medals to be a hero, Dad. I can see that now. You don't. Just... living is hard enough. Ambrose... Give me the gun. Please. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells
