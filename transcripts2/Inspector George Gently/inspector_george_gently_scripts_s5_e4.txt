 I want a visiting order. I'll get your form tomorrow. Just fill it out and get it delivered, first thing. Where to? Durham Police Headquarters. Name of Chief Inspector George Gently. And hurry up, I need a shower. I wanted to put, "Murdered while doing his duty." But they wouldn't let us. You've moved away, Bernie. I couldn't live around here anymore. I've borrowed a place out past Rothbury. Is that a good idea? I don't know what's worse... people's sympathy or knowing that some of them believe the lies.

 I mean, this was the honestest man in the world, doing the job that he'd always wanted... Even his mates believe it, don't they? That he was taking bribe money, and that's how he got shot. Well, where's the bribe money? Can I have it, please, cos I've got nowt. You know, I never believed any of this. You've been great, Mr Gently. Thank you. I came up here to tell you something, Bernie. Don't go to the inquest tomorrow. It's not be unlawful killing, for which I've been arguing. It's not even be an open verdict, I'm afraid. Well what is it going be...? Oh no, no... not suicide. No Gavin. I won't give up on this, Bernie. I promise. How did she take it? How'd you think she took it? She can't even bear to stay in Durham. She's hiding herself away in Rothbury. What's the letter? What letter? The one you didn't want me to see. Rothbury's miles away, ain't it... Yeah, miles away from the people she thinks deserted her, and destroyed her husband's reputation. Oh, well... you've heard the whispers... What whispers are they, John? Ah, come on, guv... you know? About how Gavin Henderson was in hock to the gangs in Newcastle... This bloke Rivers who's done a bunk. So, you know, it was going to come out. "In hock"? A-ha. There is absolutely no evidence to support those "whispers", apart from what's coming out of London, of course. Aye. Yeah. "Evidence from London". That means "lies", don't it? To you. Automatically. 100.000 coppers - all bent. You ever thought maybe you've just got this a little bit wrong, guv? Wrong...? Exaggerated, when you talk about how many bent coppers there are in the Met... Well actually, John, I've never tried to put a number to how many bent coppers there are in the Met. All I've ever said is what I know to be a fact... which is that during the time I was working there, I knew of at least seven career criminals. Seven? Yes, seven. Out of 100.000. It's not that many, is it? That's all I'm saying. Who was the letter from? Serious Crime Squad. London gangs are moving into the north east for the fruit machines. They're recruiting somebody with local roots and experience. And they just happened to choose you. Yeah. Why you? Why not me? No, no, no. Why you? Because maybe they don't think of me as just your sergeant, guv. Maybe they think of me as... "A rising talent". Well, congratulations. You've tried to stop us in the past... This time you can make your own decisions, John. Here, marked "urgent" from the jail, sir. Get me a cup of tea. Toto sees smoke signals, Kimosabbi. Kettle boiling. Melvyn Rattigan, you have been found not guilty of murder on one count, but guilty of manslaughter, armed robbery... Hats off to the Judy. ...and extortion. I'm sorry, my Lord, but credit where it's due. Could of been the gallows, eh? Disappointed, Gently? Melvyn Rattigan, you are a vicious, committed career criminal. And I therefore sentence you to 30 years imprisonment. Take him down. I'll be out, and it won't be no 30 years. No chaperone? I asked for a bit of privacy. Something to say to me? I had a nephew what done himself in. Went under a tube at Mile End. His wife never got over it, poor thing. When they marked it down to depression. I don't know what he had to be depressed about, he was a jockey. I didn't like him much, actually. OK, so you know that Gavin Henderson's murder is about to be called suicide. Anything else? Do you know how much I hate you, George Gently? I hate the sound of your voice. I hate your stupid face. I even hate the smell of you. Do you know what you smell like? Holy water. Sanctimonious. Stale from all the fingers what have been dipped in you. Well... Will that be all? Or have you got some actual information about Gavin Henderson's death? Well not now, I haven't. I mean, I come all this way and all I get is sarcasm. Ah, well. Never mind. You'll be out in... 1991? And they reckon we'll be all riding round in spaceships by then. I'll fly you to the moon. Look forward to it. Oi, send my love to Gitta Bronson, won't you? Yeah. When they offered me a Judy for my brief, I nearly told them where to shove it. But she was good. What a clever woman. Well, that's Jews for you. What makes you think I'll be seeing her? Oh, you'll be seeing her. What do you say about the allegations against you? Have you got any comments to make on Rattigan's release? Can we actually have a comment? Comment on what? On Rattigan's release and these allegations of corruption against you. Release...? What did you talk about, Mr Gently? Did you ask him to withdraw his allegations against you? What's the story, Inspector? Hello, John. Rattigan's being bailed pending an appeal. What? How did he get bail? On what grounds? There's new evidence. Allegations that he made at the time of the trial are being re-examined. Which ones? That you had a corrupt relationship with him. That you framed him to cover your own crimes. Well I'd like to see the evidence for that, cos there isn't any. Well, there is, Sir. Fraud Squad are saying that they've uncovered bank accounts in your name, with regular payments through 59, 60 and 61- all from Rattigan. Guv, they don't let a guy like Rattigan back on the streets just because he asks nicely... What do you think this is all about? It doesn't matter what I think, does it? I don't know maybe it's all a mistake... I don't know, guv. A "mistake"?! Guv, please. You think this is a mistake? The Fraud Squad finds bank accounts in my name, the Home Office lets Rattigan out of jail, and the Serious Crimes Squad offers you a job? And you think that's a mistake? I think you've left out "who really killed Kennedy" there, sir. Is that it? Does the name Gitta Bronson ring a bell? Yeah, Rattigan's defence counsel, why? Well, she's saying that Rattigan showed her evidence of your corrupt relationship with him at the time of the trial. Who's been telling you this? Yeah, I see... When's your interview? Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Yeah. Before you go to London, ring this number. The man who answers will meet you at King's Cross, and give you something to bring to me. OK. OK. I love this place. I don't like churches - makes me think of funerals. Good luck with your interview. 7am, David, for the assizes. Hello, Gitta. I thought I might see you. There'll be two for supper, please, Tim. Well I suppose you'd like some sort of explanation? Just let me get out of this awful uniform. Thank you, Tim. I was devastated about Isabella's murder. I did write to you. Did you...? Yes, I got your letter. Thank you. The same sort of scum who killed her is coming after me, and you're helping him. George, you know I had to tell the truth. The truth? Look, I know exactly what Rattigan is... I did spend six months defending him! You misled the court, Gitta. You knew he was a pack of lies, didn't you? No, I didn't! I'm not allowed to tell a lie in court, you know that. You were brilliant, Gitta. You even had me doubting his guilt for a while. You should've gone on the stage. Look, if it'd been down to me, I would have cheerfully hammered a six inch nail into his head. But it was not down to me. This story he spun you, about him and me being partners in crime...? He wanted it brought out in court. Yeah. Why didn't you? I didn't believe it. No, no, no, no. You just told me it didn't matter what you believe... Yes, all right. It wouldn't've helped his case. It came down to his word against yours, and the jury would've believed you. George Gently, the Met's Mister Clean. Well... The Fraud Squad's apparently "found" documents that incriminate me. This wasn't the same stuff that Rattigan showed you seven years ago? Very much doubt it. You haven't seen it, then? No. All they wanted from me was confirmation that Rattigan claimed that at the time that you were corrupt. Someone's building a case against you, George. An expert. Someone who wants to discredit George Gently, and I don't think that this is just Rattigan. No. He just wants to kill me. Yes, but... Why is it so personal for him? What? You mean apart from me putting him away for 30 years. I don't know. I've sent down dozens like him... But why now? Well, Rattigan says he knows something about the death of a young copper on my force. And he wants me to know that he knows something. Yes. And what's the connection? I don't know. I've been trying to trace this man in the fruit machine rackets. A man called Rivers. He's come up from London. He's a presence in the Newcastle underworld. So, he phones me and asks for a meeting and then suddenly, bang, he's vanished. Are you happy to be out? All of the false evidence against me has been set aside, and the evidence against the true villain, Inspector George Gently, is in the hands of the authorities. Rattigan, are you accusing Mr Gently of corruption? Oi. Oi. Hello there. John Bacchus, Detective Sergeant Kieran Lawson. Keiran. Nice to meet you. I'm Detective Inspector Reese Statham. Hello. Thanks for coming. Cheers. Ah, It's my pleasure. Listen, thanks for inviting us down. It's a... It's a big ambition of mine to join the Met, actually... There is no job, John. I'm sorry. What? I got you down here under false pretences. Serious Crimes really needs your help. What kind of help? Did you bring your guvnor's diary? No. Told you. Boy Scout. Hey, no... You asked me to steal my guvnor's diary... Borrow. Not steal. No. No, I didn't. But I did copy down the entries of the days that you asked me for. Have you got it? Why don't you give me a good reason? What we're about to tell you, John, cannot go further than this room. You cannot tell Gently about it. If you do, there will be serious repercussions for your career. Go on. OK. We're trying to find out what happened to this man. Does the name Rivers mean anything? This is Ernie Rivers? What do you know about him? Well he's connected to the fruit machine racket. He contacted Gently, but he never made the meeting. He just disappeared. Yeah, how do you know he never made the meeting? Because he never called back. No, no, no. How do you know they never met? Why would he lie to me? Rivers was one of us. He'd infiltrated a London gang who are currently taking over a big, big slice of the bandit business in your area. These are major criminals, John. We were never told about any of this. Yeah, we're not going to put an advert in the paper. All right, then. What happened with Rivers? His real name is Bill Denmoor, Detective Sergeant Bill Denmoor. We think he's dead. We think somebody found out he was Serious Crimes and killed him. "Somebody"? You mean Gently, don't you? Bill Denmoor called in on the first of March to say he was setting up a meeting to brief Gently. We never heard from him again. Gently's career's dead in the water, John, believe me. I've seen the bank accounts. So could you tell us, please? What's in Gently's log for that day? Friday the first of March, yeah? "Meet ER. Question mark." Mr Clean. Gently's been working hand in glove with the London underworld for years. According to Rattigan... We're going to need you, John. You effectively work for us now. What? What do you mean? Yeah, I'll get that put in writing, if you want. We need you to help us nail Gently. I'll organise you somewhere to kip tonight. No! I can't. I can't stay in London. I haven't got any stuff with us. What's in the bag, then? It's just some erm... stuff. It's just some stuff that Gently asked me to get for him. Like what? I don't know. I don't know he... He didn't want me to find out. Come on. Look, no... I don't think we should be doing this. Let's just leave it. You thought you knew the man. You didn't. I've got to go. Kieran'll look after you. Bit of a shock, I expect. There's no job for you here yet, but you help us get this right and there will be. This is your future now - not him. All the same... What exactly do you owe him? He stood in your way when you tried to move down here four years ago. How do you know about that? I made it my business to know. I saw the letter he wrote, blocking your move. Do you want to know what he wrote about you? No... No... Yeah. "Susceptible. Gullible. "Will be unable to avoid the pitfalls and temptations of the big city." And I quote. It's a bit rich coming from him, isn't it? There you go, gents. Here you are. No, no. Come on. I can't do anymore honestly I'm plastered. Come on, John. Just... whoa, whoa, that's it. Do you do this every night? I'm plastered, mate. Help's on its way. DC Owen Galliford. All right. Nice to meet you. DC Frannie Hilston. Hello. Hello mate, Frannie. Frannie? Yep. Sergeant John Bacchus. Now one of us... whether he likes it or not. Which, I have to admit, he didn't. Welcome, John. Thank you very much. Owen took the last call from Bill Denmoor. Oh, right. We lost a diamond there. To Bill. Bill. Bill. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don? You were always good at poker, George. You're in a spot of bother, my dear. Two filthy habits. How many times have I told you... you'll be dead before your 35. I'll be dead before the end of the week if Rattigan has his way. I don't think it's just him you've got to worry about, George. Yeah. That's what Gitta Bronson says. Rattigan can't arrange his own release. That's Home Office. And where've these bank accounts suddenly appeared from? I'm not bothered about bank accounts. Who's questioning you on Monday? My ACC. What's he like? We've had our differences... Does he want shot of you? Don't think he cares. Somebody does. I don't think he's bothered one way or another, Don. Yeah. That's what I thought, George. Look at me. One day I'm down Buckingham Palace getting me CBE, the next day, "There's your cards, mate, on your way". Never saw it coming. Somebody cared. What do you do when it's all over, Don? Play with me grandkids. I can't do that. It's not going to be all over for you, George. I'm not let them push you into retirement. We'll sort something out, you mark my words. Why did you never go for the top job? Me? Nah. Anyway, if you have to ask, it means they don't want you. Fatal lack of personal ambition. You look who gets to be commissioner. Politicians every time. Gift of the gab, know how to behave in parties, always make the right noises. I fitted into that world like a fart in a crowded lift. You need your beauty sleep. Do you want to stay the night? What, you want them calling you a poof on top of everything else? No thanks, I'll call you, let you know how it goes. I'll be there, George. I want to walk through that door with you, shoulder-to-shoulder, when they've admitted they're wrong. Don... You haven't asked me one question about these allegations against me. Not one. God bless you for that, mate. What's to ask? For you. Yeah. Keep your door locked, George. Mr Gently, Mr Gently. Can you tell us what time you're in court? Any comments? Is there anything you want to say, Mr Gently? Stop pushing in. Get back. No, you're not coming in. Morning. Taylor? Sir? No phone calls. Sir. How'd it go? Ah, you know. Hard to say, ain't it? Right. You get that package for me? You're going to kill us. Am I? I left them under a table in a bar in King's Cross and then I went for a pee. When I came back... "Them"? What was in the package, guv? Just forget it, John. They're ready for you upstairs, sir. Right. Can you take your diary with you? What, my diaries from eight or nine years ago? No, the current one, they mean. Why? Don't know, just what they said... sir. They erm... What? Good luck. Yeah. Did he bring a bag? He doesn't get it, does he? Yeah, very good. Very good forgeries. I bank with Martins. I've never had an account with this lot in my life. The account was closed in August 1961... four weeks before Melvyn Rattigan was arrested. Is that a coincidence? No. It's not a coincidence, it's not anything. This account never even existed. Closed in cash - the grand sum of £13.567. Three months later, actually during the trial of Melvyn Rattigan, you bought a flat in High Holborn for £15.000. putting down 13.000 as a cash deposit. Is there some bye-law forbidding the purchase of property whilst the Old Bailey is in session? The cash was a gift. My wife's father gave it to her. Can you prove that? With difficulty - he died shortly afterwards, in Ravenna. And my wife a few years later, as you might remember. It just so happens that this "gift" was almost exactly the same amount as you removed from the account where you were paid regular bribes by Mel Rattigan...? Well, I would guess that that's not a coincidence. I would guess that whoever was concocting this evidence would make sure that those amounts roughly tallied. Cos that's what I would do, if I was trying to frame somebody. Oh, so I'm bent now as well, am I? Like everyone else in the Met? Detective Inspector... No. I don't think you're bent, actually. I think you're an honest man. Oh, spare me, please. These are sworn statements from former and serving Metropolitan Police Officers, alleging inducements you offered them to join your criminal conspiracy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Benvill, Arms, Merit, Severa and Elnicha... These are... These are all the men who made these allegations, yes? Correct. Every single one of these is corrupt. And they know that I know, cos I've told them so. All right. Well, what did Rattigan get for all that money? What does he say that I actually gave him for all that money? I'm afraid you don't get to ask the questions any longer, Chief Inspector. I should tell you now that in accordance with a warrant granted to me yesterday, your home is currently being searched for evidence concerning these allegations... What? And for information regarding the disappearance of Detective Sergeant William Denmoor on or about the first of March this year. Who? Would you hand over your diary, please, Mr Gently? Thank you. This way, sir. Carry this out with a bit of care and respect, will you? You don't need that. Put it back. Just sitting there in the drawer. Who actually found this? She did. Get us a bag. This needs to be in a forensics lab straightaway. Sir. And the ammunition. You met "Ernie Rivers". But you knew perfectly well, that he was really Bill Denmoor from Serious Crimes? How would I know that? Where did you meet? Where is he now, George? You will show me due respect. Where is Bill Denmoor, Chief Inspector? Look. It says "question mark". "Meet ER question mark". Ask yourself why. Because no arrangement was made. A man calling himself Ernie Rivers called me on my home number - my private number... and says he's got important information about the fruit machine rackets. Well, of course I'm agree to meet him. He says he'll call back with a time and a place, and that's the last I ever hear from him. He's lying, sir. Sir? There was a drawer in the wardrobe in the bedroom. And this was shoved down the back. Interesting? It's Gavin Henderson's notebook. Sir. PC Gavin Henderson's missing notebook, found in your cottage. Together with a handgun, and shells of the same calibre used to kill that young officer. You did them both, didn't you? I have no idea what's going on here. No? Stand up. Stand up! George Gently, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Police Constable Gavin Henderson. You do not have to say anything, but anything you do say may be used in evidence. Do you understand? Not yet. Haven't you got work to go to? Biscuits? Right, erm... The last entries Gavin Henderson made before his death is three number plates. One is a Daimler, registered in Newcastle... Bill Denmoor drove a Daimler, told me it made him feel like a bookie. Yeah, Daimler was registered to Ernie Rivers. The second one is a Vauxhall Viva, which was stolen in Bermondsey on 28th of February. I'm tracing the owner now, but I'm not sure how far that'll get us if this car's been stolen... I'll get on that one. No, it's fine. I can do it. No, no, no. It's London. I have ways and means you don't know about. I can do it. It's fine. Kieran takes that. Anything on the third number? Yeah. That one's easy. That was Gently's car. I've had it impounded. Forensics are searching for fingerprints and blood. Gently's got no alibi for March the first. Alone at home. I'd like to question him. No, no, no, we can't have that, John. No, no you err... You've still got a loyalty to him. Not any more. Gavin Henderson was a local lad. Feelings are running high. I could sit in. All right. Three number plates. One's Ernie Rivers'. Second one, we don't know, stolen somewhere in London. And the third one is yours. What does that tell you? That whoever killed Denmoor probably killed Gavin Henderson as well. Oh, Sherlock Holmes lives. What it tells me is that you were there. Who's your friend? Kieran Lawson, Serious Crimes. Colleague of yours, then? Is he the one who found the gun and notebook in my house, by any chance? No. That was one of ours. Is that what they're telling you, John? Guv, I was there. Fond of guns, aren't you, Mr Gently? No, I've never actually owned a gun in my life. How'd it end up in your drawer then? The gun fairy leave it there? Has Don McGhee turn up yet? No. Were you expecting him? Make a call for me, would you please, John? And then I won't ask anything else of you, I promise. All right. Here you are. Thanks. Her name's Gitta Bronson. Good luck. Yeah. You too, John. What else did he write? He wrote, "Don't trust Lawson, he is bent." Beautiful. Ah, well. This must be hard for you. You've done well. Listen, do you want to show me Durham? Buy me a beer? Aye, go on then. How do you intend to plead? Not guilty. Is there a bail application? I'm not represented as yet, Your Worship, but I would ask you to grant bail. I can't do that, given the gravity of the charge. The Judy's held up in reception, awaiting clearance. Yeah, they're patting her down. She's probably enjoying that. So how's it feel? The door slam shut behind you. Well, you feel abandoned, don't you? Even your best mates don't want to know, cos they don't expect to ever see you again. I mean, half of them wouldn't mind shagging your wife, so actually they're glad. I lost the lot of them, thanks to you. Wife. Kids. She divorced me. Moved away. Took the kids, went to a new school. Fee paying. Little lords and ladies. Then they told their new friends their dad was dead. She changed her name by deed poll. And the kids did the same thing, by choice. She give them the choice. Anyway... you got to admit, I've stitched you up good and proper, ain't I? It's not going to get your wife and kids back though, Melvyn, is it? I don't care if it takes 20 years. You're going to die... By me. Do your very best for him at the hearing, won't you, Gitta. Although I might prefer him out in the open. Blimey O'Reilly, George. You sure you're not better off in here...? Get me out. The police have made strenuous objections to the accused being given bail. On what grounds, Madam? They feel he is extremely likely to abscond. Not at all. My client is determined to refute all charges against him, and confident of doing so. Madam, this is an unconvicted man of unblemished previous character. The evidence is all of a circumstantial nature. And, as a serving police officer, he may truly be said to be at risk in prison. Hello, hello, hello. Thank you, Tim. Thank you very much, I'll have that. And how's my favourite troublemaker? Um... very well, thank you, Tim. I think he's taken a bit of a shine to you. Um... 7am tomorrow, David, please, for the assizes. I can't represent you at your trial, you know that. You could be giving evidence for the prosecution. Tuck in. I'm a vegetarian, Tim. No, your not, it's just a phase your going through. Well, I shan't eat it. Leave the steak and kidney and eat the pudding. I can't be offering a man like this cauliflower fritters, he'll fade away. How do you like your room, Mr Gently? Very nice, thank you very much. I've put him in Grace Darling this time. Oh, you'll like that, it gets all the sun. You could force cucumbers in there. Buzz off, Tim, we'll help ourselves. I can take a hint. Buzz, buzz... You're have to have a word with him, I can't cope. Do you want that window open before I go? A bit stuffy in here isn't it? Get down! Go get down! You OK? Yes, yes. Tim? He'd dead. Call the police. Right, we need you round the back. When did you last see Gently? He left soon after I made the call. On foot? Tim had a little runabout. He borrowed that. What he asked a dead man's permission, did he? What sort of car is it? I have no idea. Don't suppose he said where he was going? Did he? You're his Sergeant, aren't you? The one who telephoned. Mrs Bronson, you don't seem to realise... Miss. Miss Bronson, you don't seem to realise... we need to find him before Rattigan does. Well, are you or aren't you? Yeah. I am. He left a message for you. He said, "Be sure to mark what he wrote." Which is what exactly? About me being bent, guv. Aye yeah, it's erm... I'm sorry to say it, but there's times when his obsessional hatred of you lot made him look ridiculous. Gramps. What darling...? I'll answer it in a minute. There's a man. George... Somebody wants to tell you something, Don. Sorry, I couldn't be there like... Don't. Rattigan tried to kill me last night. Cup of coffee? No thanks. All this on a police salary? It's clever investment. 100.000 ICI shares. You can't beat them. Who can that be, I wonder? Serious Crimes? Which one, Don? Not Statham, he's honest. A Sergeant Lawson. Take his number. I'll call him back. Shall I take Shelley? No, no, no, leave her here. Lawson. What do you want, George? I've got to drop Shelley at pony club. Pony club! You and Rattigan were in business together, weren't you? And you still are... Yes. Not Rattigan, he's a lunatic these days. Total liability. No, I have other partners now. I suppose you want some sort of "mea cupla", George...? Remember Frank Fontana? Maltese bloke? Ran all the girls. Made a fortune. Invited me to lunch. I thought it'd be just me and the wife, but no... Pop stars, sportsmen and women, politicians, judges... Thing was, we all knew what Fontana's business was, but it didn't seem to matter. Like a blinding light, George, I saw the world for what it really is, rather than how I'd always wanted it to be. Which is what? I'd wasted half my life thinking I was on the side of the law, but I wasn't. Millions like me go to work every day, pay their taxes, pay the TV license, obey the law - Mugs. No. It became clear to me - Frank was a businessman. His business needed protection. Frank sold his business to Rattigan, as I recall. To be honest, he never wanted to sell it, but he didn't fancy all out war with Rattigan, so he went gracefully. I wanted to do the same. But you couldn't. No. I was a business asset. I became Rattigan's property. No going gracefully with Melvyn. There's no retiring. Is that what Bill Denmoor wanted to talk to me about? He'd found out about you? I imagine so. And that gun that you gave me for my protection, that will turn out to be the one that killed Gavin Henderson and Bill Denmoor, won't it? How many murders have there been, Don? How many innocent men framed or silenced? You'll be the last, I hope. Gramps. It's all right darling... It's all right sweetheart, it was just a game. Don't make a fuss, George. It's how life is. Take Rattigan down. You and me could be partners, like the old days. Did friendship ever mean anything to you, Don? Can't spend it, George. Come here, sweetheart. Answer the phone. Tell Lawson I said "hi". And tell him, "I'm destroy the lot of you." BOO! You're back inside, Rattigan. I was having a bath in the hotel. Yeah, says who? Local Tom. Blonde, big tits. Does she have a name? Well she did say, but she had one of them Geordie accents, so could have been Martha, could of been Arthur. You think you're funny, but you're not. I am, but it's funny peculiar. Nah, you're just another mug on his way back to prison. You need to have a little bit of proof, actually. I don't, actually. I just need to report my suspicions, which I've done, and back you go. Yeah? Any minute now. Any minute now, yeah. You need to ring Scotland Yard. Now? Now. If he moves, kill him. What's going on? I warned him Rattigan needed 24 hour surveillance, but he knew better, he thought. Rattigan's out again. What!? Wake up, will you? Rattigan has friends. Right. OK, so what next? I've been told to wait here till we get your guvnor safely banged up again. So where is he, John? Oh, I don't know, Kieran. You wouldn't tell me, if you did, would you? The guns turned it for you, didn't it? I could see it in your face. Question... "Why would Gently get me to bring guns up from London if he already had one at home in his drawer?" Answer? What's yours? "The guns were evidence against him. He intended to dispose of it." Except he didn't, did he? It was just left lying there. Like you do, with a gun that you've just killed two coppers with. People do funny things, John. Oh, for God's sake. It never occurred he would be found out. George Gently? Mr Clean? It'd never happen, would it? Morning, guv. Frannie, how was the trip? Durham! I wondered where all the flies went for their holidays. Now, now, Owen. Good to see you. All right, Frannie? Good to see you. John's just thinking about where his guvnor might be laying his head. How are you, John? Hello again. Good to see you. There must be somewhere he'd use, or somebody. I just want to say, I don't agree with any of this that's happening with Mr Gently... Is he a real policeman, or does he rent that costume? OK. What? Oh, come on, John. We need to get to Gently before Rattigan does. OK, all right. He got very close to my ex. You know, a bit too close. And it seemed that the more time she spent with him, the colder she got toward me, you know? I don't exactly know what he said to her, and I don't exactly know what went on. But I never got her back, I know that. Where is she now? What the hell do you think you're playing at? You'll cause an accident. What do you want? Who are these lot? Looking for George. Oi! What you doing? Going somewhere, Mrs Bacchus? Sleeping bags, primus, tins of food. We need to find him. For his own good. His own good? How could you stoop so low? And you lot are London, are you? Finally getting what you want, Joe? Playing with the big boys? You disgust me. You should be protecting George. We were trying to protect him. Get your hands off my property! Gently's brand, by any chance? And a million other people, including me. Where is he, Lisa? I wouldn't tell yous if I knew. Me and Leigh Ann are going camping with the man who's going to be her new dad. He's just gone to pick her up... Daddy! Careful, Leigh Ann. Daddy! Hey, sweetheart. What's the matter? It's nothing. They're just going, aren't you? Leigh Ann, go inside for a minute, pet. There is a reason. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't of done it... No, I shouldn't of done it. And nor should George Gently. He took you under his wing, for God's sake! And that was a mistake as well, because you will never be half the man he is. I despise you, John Bacchus. Well if he hasn't done so already, he'll be on a ferry to Hamburg, if he's got any sense. Scot free. Stop pretending with me, OK? You what? I don't think Gently needed to write about me in your book. I think you made your own mind up on me. But let me tell you something... Gently is guilty. You can't be expected to see that, but don't waste any more of my time with stunts like this. Actually, that's not what he wrote. What he wrote was, "You find the second car, you'll find the killer." You took that job off me. Why? Well, to make sure it got done. Oh, yeah? That car was stolen from a pub car park 50 yards away from number 19 Halley Street in Bermondsey. What does that mean? Hey! Hey! Yeah, make and colour. No sign of the driver. If it's him, he's armed and dangerous. Can I have instructions now, please? Do not approach, wait for backup. I'll take the radio, Constable. Toss it over. Did you give them your position? What were your instructions? Not to approach you. Armed and dangerous. Well... What happens now, do you think? Now turn around and walk away. Go on. It was this road here. His car was around here. It'll still be there. He went a different way. He's on foot. All right? What's going on? Gently was near Rothbury two hours ago, on foot. Do you know where Rothbury is? Yeah, course I do. What sort of gun was it? Erm... I never actually got a good look at it. I bet you still shat yourself though, eh? Did you get any kind of look at it? He kept it in his pocket. Why didn't he shoot us? Does he have any friends in the Rothbury area? We could spend a week going door to door. No. I've never heard him mention anybody in Rothbury. You lads might as well go back to bed. We'll erm... We'll start a search in the morning. Night. Night. Where is he? It's a guess. Change of plan? John's had a thought, but it'll probably be as good as the one about his missus. You lads turn in. No, no. Sent to help. I need to know what is going on here, Kieran. OK. Here it is, John. You asked me who lives at 19 Halley Street in Bermondsey, near where the Vauxhall had been stolen, the one that turned up in Gavin Henderson's notebook. Owen Galliford lives there. I'll try and lose them. Ready? Yep. After them. You? You look terrible. Wouldn't you like a cup of tea? I never really believed what they were saying. Thank you. Who's that? Go inside, lock the door, stay away from the window. It's all right, go on. Keep those two as far away as possible, OK? Hilarious, Speedy Gonzalez. You two, go round the back. You, stay in the car. Kieran, listen to me. There's only one way to do this. If Gently is in there, I have to persuade him to come out with his hands up, OK, me. I don't think they're arrest him, do you? Or they could be trying to protect him from us. They could be working with him. Do you really believe that stuff about Gently anymore, huh? Galliford's car turns up in Gavin Henderson's notebook the night he died. Why? Because he killed Denmoor. And I'm willing to bet he killed Gavin Henderson an' all. Your two mates here have tried to have my guvnor put away, and now they're kill him. They're criminals, Kieran. They're not bent coppers. They're criminals, working inside the Met. Oi. What? I've known these guys half my life. It's hard, isn't it? I don't know what to believe anymore. The less sure you are, the more I like you. Guv, it's me. Mrs Henderson? My name is Sergeant John Bacchus. You've nothing to fear. If you're in there, please make yourself known. Guv, are you in there? If you can hear me, please come out. Come out with your hands up and it'll all be OK, I promise. You have to trust me, guv. I want you to trust me. Kieran. All right. This man... and the man through there. They killed Denmoor. They were the ones in the second car. Pretty sure they killed Gavin Henderson. How about this one? Nah, No. I thought he was part of it. That's why I had to do the things that I did. Guv, I had to get him to trust me, you know? Give me your gun. Guv... Gun! Car keys. You've been hit, guv. All right. Look after Bernie. Guv, You need to go to hospital... Don't come after me! I warn you. All right. All right. OK. I'm finish this. Blimey O'Reilly, what you done this time? You got any painkillers? I've got some codeine, but you should really get to a hospital... Give me all you've got. I really need to sleep for an hour. I can't drive. Nor can I. Is your chauffeur reliable? Yes... Why'd you never marry? Well, I dabbled with men in my 20s. Quite a lot, actually. But they all seemed so frightfully... fond of themselves. They didn't seem to really need me to be fond of them as well... So I just got on with the work. In the unlikely event that I'm still alive, not incarcerated next week... would you consider having dinner with me? Well... I'll certainly consider it. Well, shall I perhaps see you later then, George? If there's anything left of me. Thank you. Sorry. This'll do. There's blood on the seat. I apologise. I'll see to it, sir. Would you like me to wait? No, thanks. Look after Miss Bronson. I will, sir. Sir? You have a Mr Rattigan staying here. Erm... Ah, no, he went out a few minutes ago. Would you be Mr Gently? Yes. He left a message for you. He said he'll wait for you in the Cathedral. Pass key, please. It's just up there. Rattigan? Don... Give yourself up. I'll do what I can for you. Move! Move, get away! Owen and Frannie are dead. You're not a killer, Don. Why couldn't you just let it go, George? Why do you always have to be Mr Clean? Because life isn't a racket, Don. And if it is, I don't want to be part of it. You're not going to be, are you? McGhee... I'm unarmed. Well you're a mug in that case, son. Don't do it, John. I was... Always on your side, guv. I know. I'm sorry. I left you unarmed.
