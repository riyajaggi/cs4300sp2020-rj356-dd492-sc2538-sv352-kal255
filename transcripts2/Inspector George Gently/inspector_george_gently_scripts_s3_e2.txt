 Inspector George Gently (2007â€“2017): Season 3, Episode 2 - Peace & Love - full transcript 
 The year is 1966 and the football World Cup has come to England. With the USSR due to play at Roker Park and the fear of the 'Reds Under the Bed' exemplified by the upcoming Polaris submarine landing at the nearby Jarrow docks, tensions are running high. CND protesters, lead by radical students from Durham University, are the last thing the police need when the world media is on their doorstep awaiting the upcoming football match. Gently and Bacchus investigate the murder of a well know Lefty academic, found dead in the docks post a CND rally. This takes them onto the Durham University campus - an ancient temple of learning struggling to come to terms with the novel influx of students from the working class and brash, radical, academics. Sexual and Social rebellion is everywhere in the air and to the young and optimistic these forces seem inevitable and unstoppable. Bacchus is horrified yet fascinated by the promiscuity on display. Gently, a war veteran, more shrewdly recognises that Liberation is not always an unmixed blessing...

 1, 2, 3, 4. No-one wins a nuclear war! 1, 2, 3, 4... 1, 2, 3, 4. No-one wins a nuclear war! Hey, back, you stay back. 1, 2, 3, 4. No-one wins a nuclear war! I am warning you. What are you going to do? Get off me! Come on. Straight down. Bit of overtime? You missed a right good scrap, sir. Hundreds of them turned up. Where's your collar numbers, John?

 Must have got tugged off. On both sides? It was a hell of a scrap, sir. Ow! You're breaking my arm! We hate the pigs! We hate the pigs! I need your name, sir. I want a lawyer present. We can't get you a lawyer without a name. How's he supposed to know who to send his bill to? Who's in charge here...? Is it you? No, sir, I'm a Chief Inspector. What's your number? My name is DCI George Gently. Make a note of that. I haven't been offered a phone call. That's because you've only been arrested, sir. You haven't been charged with an offence. I teach at the university. I think I know my rights. Would you like to be charged with an offence? No, but I do want to make a complaint. I've been assaulted.

 Let this officer book you in and then you can register your complaint. And you'll throw it in the bin. Nazi! Oi! Show some respect! Oink, oink! Oink, oink! Oink, oink! Shut up! Oink, oink! Oink, oink! You want to go straight into the cells, eh? Anybody still singing... Right open the doors! Come on, John. You're not Greavsie, keep it simple! Shoot! Shoot! Yes! Oi! England could use you in the World Cup. I didn't know you were a fan, sir. I'm not. Come on, get changed. We've got a job on. Murder? Friend of yours apparently. We found him floating in the dock this morning. He and his CND colleagues had been drinking in that pub there. He might of had a few and lost his footing? He's been in a fight of some sort. Blow to the back of his head. Yes. And Gouge marks on his face as well. Some of these injuries could have been post mortem, bobbing about on the dock all night. We won't know till we get the pathologist's report. Sir. He's got oil on his clothes. John. Looks like he's been dragged. It's not an accident that, is it? No. I don't think so. He was unconscious when he was put in the water. Cos if he had been conscious he would have resisted. He'd have writhed about a bit. Sir! Over here, sir. It's a blood splatter, sir. What? Is that blood? Guv. It's blood. Maybe this is where he was whacked in the head. Apparently he left the pub last night with one of his students. Name of Elizabeth Higgs. She hasn't been seen since. Right. Do you want us to call in at your place? Why? You might want to pick up a clean shirt. We are going to a place of higher learning after all. I just haven't been to the laundrette this week. Ok. Lisa is still at her Mum and Dads. She definitely wants a divorce. And? She expects me to stand up in court and say I've been with other women! Well, you have... No other way? Yes, she'll have to wait for five years. I've never actually set foot inside this place. I was invited to participate in a debate here a few months back. Debate what? "The Law Is An Ass." How did that go? They expected me to oppose the motion. I had an aunt who came here. Did you really? Yes, yes. She used to clean the dorms. She said they were a mucky lot. If I could just ask you to sign there, gentlemen. Certainly. We log all our visitors, even officers of the law. We're told Miss Higgs shared a room with another girl? Miss Doyle, sir. Not the best of influences I'm afraid. There you go. Thank you. I'll show you up. I see you were in the desert? I was a mosquito, sir. You were lucky. I had to march. Were you with the Eighth? Came in at Salerno. You wonder if it was all worth it now, don't you, sir? The sacrifice. For this mob. No thought for anyone else of course. You the Head Porter here? I have been since I was demobbed in '47, sir. Decent girl Miss Higgs. Worked ever so hard to get herself here. Father's only a welder. It's through here, gentlemen. Thank you. I'll be at the front desk if you need me, sir. He's a right old coot him, ain't he! His war service is fairly impressive. Did you see the Military Cross? The boys in blue. I'm Professor Mallory Brown, Elizabeth's tutor. You teach Elizabeth...? Civil Law... I have all her records in my study. Follow me. What do I call you? Chief Inspector. As in Clouseau? As in Gently. Do you know what happened? We've established it wasn't an accident. And Elizabeth? So far we've found no trace of her. Is that good news? It could be. She is one of our best students. Serious, committed. Had a mountain to climb to get here. Yes. I understand that she's from a humble background. She also has the handicap of being a woman. I didn't think that made any difference these days. Did you not? You don't seem overly concerned about Mr Barratt? Well, any man's death diminishes me, of course. Do you know of anybody who might have held a grudge against him? Half the female population of the university! Fraser embraced the ideology of sexual liberation with gusto. Spreading the gospel of free love even unto the freshers. I'm sure you think our campaign threatens the safety of the Realm. It doesn't matter what I think. You're very wrong. It does. This issue affects every single one of us. A nuclear war will wipe us all from the face of the Earth. You fought in the war? Yes. Do you want to see another one? I don't believe rioting will achieve peace. I don't sanction the violence. I'm a pacifist. That's the whole point of CND. Is it? It's Fraser Barratt and his Trotskyite faction who argued for violence. It discourages decent people from turning up, scares them away. You'd almost think that... Think what? That the State was paying people like Fraser to undermine us. Perhaps there are some decent people who don't support your aims. Of ending nuclear war? Of leaving us defenceless against the Soviet Bloc. Where's Elizabeth? Have you locked her up again? No. Why, should we? Well, where is she then? She didn't come back last night. Her parents haven't heard from her either. She would hardly go there! She's got nothing in common with them. Hasn't she? They work in factories and things. They don't understand her. Who's this fella then? Che! Has he got a second name? Guevara. I take it he's her boyfriend? Have you really never heard of him? Does she have a boyfriend? Well, she did. She was courting Fraser Barratt? It's rather over now. Poor old Fraser. Were you in the pub with him last night? Yeah. We all were. After you lot let us split your sty we all went back to the docks. Rally the troops. Change is coming, people! The world is turning! Things aren't going to be this way for much longer. Today, in the North East we stood up and we said, "No to Polaris, "no to the bomb and no to war!". Instead we say, "Yes, to grooving, yes, to peace and yes, to love"! Right on. And don't think, comrades, that because we failed to stop these evil submarines arriving here today that the battle is lost. Oh, no! We have plans! We will enter that yard! And we will send these deadly toys back. Is it true? What's true, pet? What I just heard? Probably. How could you? Look. Don't get all heavy with me now. A row. About what? What do guys and chicks usually argue about? I told her I'd done Fraser. You also had relations with Mr Barratt. I didn't have "relations" with him pork chops. I HAD him. You do know what that means? 'Course. Far out. French letters. Hardly a surprise. Cigarette papers. Matches. He was a Communist Party member. Is that legal? We did win the war you know, John. It's a free society. It was for him. He was having it away with half the girls on campus. Look how much he was getting paid! They are our taxes, you know. Makes you wish you'd paid attention at school, doesn't it? Is that what I think it is? Yes. Cannabis resin. It's a bit late to charge him with it now, ain't it? What do you think caused this injury to the back of his head? A blunt instrument. Weighty. A club? Yes, something like that. A truncheon? Could be. When Mr Barratt was detained here, he wanted to make a complaint. He threatened to. Did he? Don't think so. We nearly lost control of them. We had to weigh in. So he might have got a clump? If they had broken through our lines and got into that dock they'd have had the Navy to deal with. Could this have killed him? I can't give an opinion until I've done the post mortem. But from a superficial examination I think it's unlikely. So he might not have been drunk, he could have been suffering from delayed concussion. Yes, highly possible. So if he was still dizzy when he left the pub, he'd be easy prey. Yes, he would. Anyone would have been able to overpower him. Even a woman. Morning, Guv. All right. Morning, sir! Well, Gently, any progress? Not much, we've issued her photo to the press, no response, so far. I'm struggling for boots with all these demos. We will apply ourselves, Chief Constable. With Polaris in the County we are going to be under an intense spotlight. Which means that if we can make it through to Christmas without incident it's gongs all round. No doubt. Now we've got this Association Football tournament nonsense coming here as well. Just means more louts. Association Football tournament! What is he talking about? Not a clue! Sir. They've dredged something up. Is this it? Pulled it out an hour ago, sir. Why would she throw this away? Maybe she went in with it. It looks like a child's hand writing, doesn't it? Does the name "David Swift" mean anything to anybody? You mean Swifty? Aye, he works at the dockyards over here. You'll find him in his caravan around the corner. Thank you. Get this in a box for us, will you? Yes, sir. I already spoke to your lads. He said he's already been interviewed. Where's Swift now? I divvent knaa. He diwnae been back hym sin Satdee neet. He doesn't know. He hasn't seen him since Saturday night. All right if we have a look in here? Aye gan reet aheid an help yorsel. He's canny lad like. Parish bairn. He's all right. He's an orphan. He rents this place does he? Two bob a week. Two shillings a week. Thank you, John. I understood that. That's his bed there. Is that him? Aye, that's him. Where exactly is this Polaris submarine? The Naval dry docks just through there, sir. Who's got a key to these gates? Whoever's on watch. Me or Swifty. Do you smell bacon? News? I'm afraid not. David Swift, earnest lad. We met him one day when we were out leafleting the dock workers. Hoping to get them onto our side. He's very eager to improve himself. Elizabeth offered to teach him to read. Were they romantically connected? She was infatuated with Fraser. But Fraser Barratt and David Swift knew each other? Well, I suppose they may have done. Fraser loved the working people as a class, he proclaimed that with his help they would shortly inherit the earth. But he had very little interest in any of its individual representatives. David Swift lives just a few minutes away from where Barratt was killed. Any thoughts on that? No. Have you? It seems more than mere coincidence. And Elizabeth? The jotter's wet. We only found her satchel. We've no idea where she is. Oh, oh. Fuzz alert. Hello. You heard from Elizabeth? No, why? Do you know where she is? I wish I did. I hear you're in the midst of a Sexual Revolution. I was reading your posters. You should jump on board, baby. You can't make love if you're wearing chains. Kick the bishop out the bedroom and that old judge goes too. Everyone is free to do exactly what they feel, whenever they feel like it. You'll see a totally different world. Aye, YOU will! If we're all making love. We won't have time to make bombs. I might give it a go. There's nothing that hasn't been done before. Just that nobody has to lie about it any more. Sniffer dog, sniffer dog. Snoop's about, got to split. Not invited you on board the Love Train then? No chance of that. They're getting their way though. Soviets will be coming here soon. Only for football, we hope. Roker Park will be sold out with all the Commies up here. Aye. The way things are going, there'll be a statue of Lenin on Gilesgate and all be learning Russian. They've already taken over this place. Their tendrils reach everywhere. Even the governors. What do you mean? Water under the bridge now. Sir. Charles the Head Porter and Barratt had a big fall out three weeks ago. Really, why? He discovered that Barratt had stayed overnight in Elizabeth Higgs' room. Now this is against College rules. Listen... "Any inappropriate relationship between academic staff and students is strictly forbidden". So presumably he reported him? Yes, he did and Barratt would have been sacked for this. But Professor Mallory Brown stepped in and saved his skin. Claimed that he'd been working with her all that evening. Maybe he had? Maybe he had but wait for this. When Barratt was off the hook he turned it all against Charles. Said that Charles told lies. Said he'd been slandered and then he tried to get Charles fired. What was the outcome? The Governors are still considering whether to reprimand him. Well, bring him in. Let's see what he has to say. Barratt stayed overnight in the room of a female student. I reported him as I am duty bound to do. Unfortunately, the governors accepted his denials. That must have been very wounding for you? They could hardly accuse two of their academic staff of lying. And were they? Absolutely. Both Barratt and Professor Brown are driven by political ambitions. The interests of their young students seem not to register with either of them. Surely they have a right to protest? No doubt. But his group intend to take matters into their own hands. They want to sabotage the Polaris subs. You think that's why he died? I've no idea, sir. But he was playing with fire. Were you down in the docks Saturday night? Yes, I was. Can you tell us why? No. What! Just "no"? I'm sorry. I can't say why. You're going to have to, this is a murder enquiry. I'm sorry. Does the reason that you won't answer perhaps have anything to do with a woman? Yes, sir, it does. In a way. You're going to have to explain. We are only interested in finding a killer here. It's very awkward, sir. Nevertheless. It involves Her Majesty. I see. Mosquitoes was our nickname for the Long Range Desert Group. They operated deep behind enemy lines. Oh, right. Were you a Commando? Special Air Service, actually, sir. Worked very closely with Military Intelligence. I spoke to a commander down in Special Branch. They will neither confirm nor deny that they know Charles Hexton but they did advise me to exclude him from our enquiries. Which is as good a confirmation as we'll get? Yes. Let's find David Swift. Photograph, sir. Right, good. Thank you. David Swift... Hasn't been back home to his digs since Saturday night. We want to speak to him urgently. Elizabeth Higgs? Are you Detective Sergeant Bacchus? Adriana said you were groovy. Are you all right? Yes. Just a bit dizzy. You all right? I'm fine now, thanks. I've not eaten. Taylor, fetch us a cup of tea, will you? Nice and sweet. I need to ask you a few questions about Fraser Barratt. I know you do. Are you aware that he's dead? I read it in the papers. Have you any idea who killed him? Yes. I do. I think I did. Did you offer her a lawyer? No. She didn't ask for one. She's 19. She is studying Law. Probably not even got as far as the Magna Carta yet. I'm Detective Chief Inspector Gently. I'd like you to tell us exactly what happened on Saturday night. I discovered what a rotter Fraser was. Fraser, wait for me! Don't you love me any more? Of course I love you, pet. I just don't feel you right now. I thought we were... What? Forever. Yes. Come on. Nothing's forever. I'm just not a one woman sort of guy. Can't you understand that? Yeah, I understand. I understand that all right. You're a liar and a cheat! Adriana told me everything! I hope she didn't tell you everything. Scumbag! Argh! That's my work! Crazy chick! You need to see a shrink. Are you all right? Go away from me. Leave me alone! I left him there. You believed you had killed him? Well, I thought he'd maybe fallen in after I'd gone. Was David Swift with you at any point in the evening? David, no. So you never told your lover about this young lad you were teaching to read? I might have mentioned him but... They didn't ever meet. I think they did. Really, when? Perhaps as recently as Saturday night. Oh! Are you Ok? Argh! Ambulance, quickly! Promise you won't tell anyone about this. Where did you go? Edinburgh. Who do you know in Edinburgh? No-one. That's why I went there. I had a phone number. Did you dial it? Yes. I booked in. Then I read in the papers that Fraser was dead. I knew I couldn't go through with it. This is all I've got left of him now. If you could excuse us, please. That's Ok. She could still have done it, sir. Fit of rage. She seems like a nice girl but women go a bit loony when they're in the family way, believe me. Lisa went mental. Crying like the world's ending. Hurling things around. At you? Yeah, at me! Women can't handle their emotions like we can. Fraser Barratt weighed eleven and a half stone. You reckon she could have dragged him into the water? Maybe somebody helped her. David Swift? He lives nearby. She only has to run over to his place. Why would Swift help her? Well... He looks up to her. She was teaching him. She's his best chance of getting on in life. Yes. Maybe he was carrying a torch for her. Yes. How is she? She's out of danger, apparently. Has she lost it? No. She was lucky. Do you think so? You knew she was pregnant, didn't you? She confided in me, yes. You should have informed us. It was confidential. Did you give her that phone number in Edinburgh? If she has that child it's the end of her degree. The end of her career. And she'll be all on her own with nothing. Are you aware it's Fraser Barratt's child? Yes. Well aware. Sir. Customs picked up David Swift last night. He was nicked trying to stow away on a freight ship bound for Helsinki. There you go. He was born South Shields in 1946, raised by nuns. He's worked on the dock since he was 14, sir. He told you all this already? No! No! No! We can't get a cheep out of him. But he was carrying his passport. And this. Same as what Barratt had. Any idea where this place is. No. No idea. I thought you knew all the nightclubs in the North East, John. Right. David. What made you want to run away? I've nothing to say to you. Elizabeth Higgs. You know who I'm talking about, don't you? This is your writing. Of course, yeah. Bless her. She met you out campaigning for the CND. You familiar with any of their other members? Fraser Barratt? Come on! Fraser Barratt. You know, commie bloke from up the Uni. Big head, thought himself a bit of a ladies man. I think you did know Fraser Barratt. Did you socialise with him? At the Seagull Club, perhaps? He was murdered very near your home. I heard about that on the news. I didn't know that was his name though. So you know absolutely nothing about how he met his death? No. Are you sure? I have nothing to say to you. We can keep you here overnight you know. So it might be a lot more comfortable for you if you just decided to cooperate with us. I have nothing to say to you. Nigel. Sir. I've been onto the Licensing Board. I have a trace on the Seagull Club. It's part of a hotel in Whitley Bay, sir. Near the seafront. Have we made any progress? Some. I thought this might be useful, sir. It's the names of all the students who attended the protest on Saturday. Also the one's who were in the bar later. Members, affiliates etc. Is this an official position? Informal, sir, deniable. Why didn't you show me this before? I had to get clearance. I don't see Elizabeth Higgs name down here. I recorded her as X5, sir. I wouldn't want to ruin her career. She'll grow out of all this. Evening, gentlemen, I'm afraid this is a private club. Yes, we're aware of that, aren't we, John. Yes. We've been here before. All right, come in, tout-suite. Evening. What can I do you for? Er, I'll have a pint of... Two gin and tonics, please. I don't like gin and tonic. I want a pint. You're on duty, son, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Seems quite tame, in here, doesn't it? It's nice. I'd bring a bird in here. Put a tosheroon on the tab for me, ducks. You have done well. This is a teapot's place. You flipping well knew, didn't you? I had my suspicions. You do know what they get up to in here, don't you? I've got a fair idea, John. Barratt was getting it every which way, wasn't he? Excuse me? Same again? No. I need your help, please. With what? Do you recognise either of them? No. Yes. We're police officers. And we're closing now. I don't want to alarm your customers. We're not from Vice. We are not interested in vice. We're investigating a murder. Who's dead? This man. I don't know who he is. I might have seen him in here once. How about him. No. Look. We'll be here tomorrow night. And the night after. And the night after. And by then your clientele will be thinning out. Ok, Ok... I do know her. Is he a regular? He pops in from time to time. Tell me anything else about him? In here, duck, they don't tell you and you don't ever ask. Ok, thanks. Are you going to leave us in peace now? I think so. All right, I'll tell you for free. He came in once, last week. I can't tell you what night. He stayed for an hour. I don't think WE were his cup of tea. Anybody with him? On his todd, duck. I only remember him because he swiped all me matches off the bar. Are we going to report that place to Vice, sir? You heard my promise to him. Sir, it's flagrantly illegal what they get up to in there. Buying drinks and peanuts? You know what they do. We're here to investigate a murder. Sir! What about the people that live round here. Or bring their kids to the beach? It's Whitley Bay it's not Soho. You never get near the real owners anyway. Next week they'll open up a place two streets away. I worked Vice in Soho for several years. All I learnt was that the harder you push these vice lords down the stronger they get. In the end they beat us anyway. How? They bought us. YOU took a bribe? Perhaps I should have done. I'd have been Chief Constable by now. Are you ready to talk to us? Right. You frequent a club in Whitley Bay which is a known haunt for homosexuals. I have nothing to say to you. You're a pansy. I can get you locked up for what you get up to down there. I'm not ashamed. I don't hurt anyone else. You and Fraser Barratt, you were having it away, weren't you? Were we heck! You arranged to meet him down the docks. All goes wrong. So you kill him. I don't even know this fella! Don't lie. Don't lie. You met him here. This is rubbish! It's a fairytale! Fairytale! Did you see Elizabeth Higgs at any point on Saturday night? No. She was down in the docks. Well, I wasn't. Where were you then? You know where I was. You won't have any witnesses? How can I? Soon as they put their hand up you'll have cuffs on them. That's convenient, isn't it? Was Fraser Barratt attempting to blackmail you? Compel you to open the gates so his lot could get into the Naval dockyard. I've told you I don't even know him! He's dead. Yeah, well, I never knew him. He tailed you to the Seagull Club, didn't he? Discovered your sexual habits and threatened to expose you. I never knew him. Really, I never met him. I never even heard of him 'till now. Taylor. Get his stuff. Oi! Don't go too far. We might want to speak to you again. You do understand the terms of your release? You have to come back and report to us at nine o'clock tomorrow. Ah-ah! Well, keep a hold of this. No jumping on any more boats then, eh. I'm working tomorrow at nine o'clock. Well, you'll have to take some time off, then, won't you? Just sign there, please, sir. Just a cross will do. Are you sure about this, guv? Nothing to hold him on. He did it though? Quite possibly. But where's his motive? He doesn't seem to have known Barratt. The Head Porter though. He seemed to be very protective of Elizabeth, didn't he? I thought that was his job? What? Spying on a young girl's rooms in the middle of the night. It's not exactly fighting the Cold War, is it? Mr Hexton. Do you mind if I ask you a few more questions about Elizabeth Higgs? You saw her arrive at the pub? Yes, sir. But you never saw her leave? I only wanted to establish who was meeting down there. I didn't stay much longer. You close to Elizabeth? No, sir, not at all. But you admire her? Well, yes. She had a struggle to get here as I told you. What are you implying? How did you know that Fraser Barratt had been in her room overnight? I saw him emerging in the early hours. You were spying on her? Certainly not. I was called to a room on the floor above. Their lights had fused. I happened to be passing her door and saw him. So you report every incident then? No. But I chose to report Barratt's. He was taking advantage of a very impressionable girl. From that background she was easy prey to a seducer like him. Perhaps their feelings were mutual. God, man, she's 19. He was supposed to be her teacher! You think I have some sort of salacious interest in Miss Higgs? Isn't wanting to protect a young girl from harm sufficient motive? Yes, but why her? The other students here have family and connections to fall back on. She has none. So yes, I do have particular regard for her. But I was repelled to discover Barratt had taken advantage of her and I reported him to prevent it happening again. Unfortunately, I failed and she is in hospital, and expecting. And you could lose your job? I think the Governors will recognise now I told the truth. So, really, Fraser Barratt's death was quite fortuitous for you? I suppose it was. But it's come rather too late for Miss Higgs. Where's Gently? He has gone up the hospital, sir. Lisa claims that she has asked you for a divorce. It's what she wants, sir. Is it what you want? Do you want your daughter to grow up fatherless? Lisa seems to have made up her mind. She's only a young girl! She doesn't know her own mind. She certainly doesn't understand the shame she is going to feel. Along with the rest of our family. I did ask her to reconsider. Well... Well, perhaps she'll calm down eventually and realise she's better off married. No matter how disappointing a husband you might be. Yes, sir. Well. You've made an arrest anyway. That's good. Has he confessed? No. He denies it. He had the opportunity though, yes? And the motive? It wasn't enough to charge him on. Are you quite sure about that, Sergeant? I mean... Lad like him? Never going to get a decent lawyer, is he? The DCI thinks we still need hard evidence, sir. Shouldn't be too hard to find though, eh? You go over that crime scene again. I fell for Fraser from the first tutorial. He told me I wrote the longest essays and wore the shortest skirts. His lectures were amazing. I thought he understood everything. History, politics, life. But he was incapable of hearing any voice but his own. Not just that. He couldn't understand how anyone else felt. Do you think he was capable of blackmail, to get what he wanted? Now I think he was capable of anything. Are you sure you don't mind? No. Not at all. I worked so hard to get here. All my friends going out on a Friday night and I'm sat at home revising. I was going to be a lawyer. Fight for people's rights. But now I'm going to be Mum. Wondering how to pay off the coal man and the milkman, and the tally man. Just the same as my Mum. Sir! Right. I need your lads to go back over this crime scene. Hands and knees. Every inch. We need a piece of hard evidence, a weapon, a fingerprint, even a fibre, right? Very good, Sergeant. When you've done that. You can go over the caravan as well. Ok, sir. Right. There he is lads. Oh, you little villain! Don't you mind about them. You're always be all right in here with me, you know. David Swift is a homosexual. Ah. I shan't ask you how you found that out. You knew that, didn't you? It would help if you didn't withhold information from our enquiries. It would help if the Law allowed people to live and love as they pleased. Then none of us would have to keep secrets. Did you tell Fraser Barratt that David Swift was a homosexual? Cos I think you did. Fraser teased me that David fancied me. It all became rather tiresome. How did he react when you told him? Surprise. It was a bit fruity even for Fraser. Well, he decided to blackmail him. How did you deduce that? How did I deduce that? Barratt was determined to get into the Naval dockyard. David Swift had access to the keys to the dock gate. He started prowling round David's caravan. Followed him to some seedy club. I wished I'd never told him. Fraser argued that the campaign was far more important than David's happiness. Who else was aware of this plan? Only me. Fraser wouldn't let go of the idea. The plan... The plan was we'd open the gate, rush in and block access to the naval dry docks where the subs are. Did any of you stop to consider what might have happened to you if this plan had succeeded? Have you ever stopped to consider what will happen if a nuclear missile lands on Tyneside? Oh, lovely. Look at that. I see you got Italy coming up here, Mrs Laparelli? Are you going to go? If they played it in the street I'd shut the curtains. All right! Only asking! You on duty? No. Me neither, so let's just be in the moment, man, you dig? You looking after Elizabeth? I don't want to talk about Elizabeth. Talk about you then, will we? If you like. I'd much rather talk about you though. You have totally groovy hair but you're with the Fuzz. I've been told to get it cut. Don't. Promise me. You knew where Elizabeth was all along, didn't you? She called me up. Long distance. I told her the best thing to do was to come back and ask for you. Aye, I forgot, you're a great friend to her. Yes, I am a very good friend to her. Going with her boyfriend and that! It was the only way to turn her on to what sort of guy he was. She was actually thinking about going ahead and having Fraser's baby! She imagined he would stick around, give her a ring, roses and turtle doves. What about free love? Elizabeth can't handle free love, she's much too serious. Are you coming? All right. Bye. See you. You have a ring. Are you married? Yes. But you're eating in the chippy. She blew you off! Far out. Is that right? No. Mrs Chops had enough of the pig scene and split. She's visiting her mother. Great! How? You won't be expected back home. Will you? Good evening, sir. I'm so glad Miss Higgs is safe and back amongst us. I've been reading through this. Barratt is FB and MB is Professor Brown, I presume. You've cracked my code. They seem to have met alone together many times. Indeed. They were lovers? For several years. She supervised his PhD. She's considerably older. Anything goes here. He had other girls. No young lady was safe around him. Professor Brown put up with it until a few months ago, when he finally dropped her. Why? He got his tenure, permanent position. He no longer needed her. Then why did she lie in front of the university governors to protect him? Women allow love to completely govern their lives. Don't we? Not to the point of destroying ourselves. You got one life, man, and then it's gone, or the bomb comes and bang, you're ash in a flash. Could happen tomorrow. Yes. Yes, it could. When that flash comes you want to have a lot to remember, right. My mum was the first girl my dad ever kissed. They were younger than me when they got married. They've been together for 25 years and they never say a kind word to each other. They're not happy but they've left it too late. My Mum and Dad were together for 20 years. Why would you shackle yourself to just one person no matter how groovy they are? If you're in chains, how can you fly? What is it you want from me? Absolutely nothing. Just a bit of a game to you this, isn't it? Life is a game. Not to people like me it's not. I'll give you a lift home. Don't you listen to your radio? How did you know where I was? Dog team passed you half an hour ago. Didn't want to disturb you. Something on your mind? No. I'm just enjoying the view. Right, try this. David Swift is dead. Come on. How? He caught the Flying Scotsman. Maybe he did kill Barratt. Knew that we were going to find enough evidence to arrest him again and took the only way out. But of course you're going to tell me that in murder investigations it's never the obvious thing. Well, actually, John, it usually is the obvious thing. Look at his eyeball. Blood vessels look burst to you? Yeah. That's petechial haemorrhaging. Strangled? He was already dead when he was laid on the tracks. This whole thing has been staged to look like a suicide, but it's murder, isn't it? Yes. All right, maybes he didn't kill Barratt... ..but he knew who did it. Go on. He saw who killed Barratt and he kept that from us. Why? They're a friend. They're a friend! He wanted to protect them. He's gone. He cleared right out. Took all his things. Did he take a bag with him? Aye, he did. Like a duffle bag, like a tartan one. He was running away, weren't he? Do you know where he was headed? I divvent knaa, bonny lad. But I knaa he never got there. I thought I heard you make a promise not to ever come back. I'm afraid circumstances have changed. It is him, then? I'm afraid so. He claimed to us that he was down here, Saturday night. I don't recall. You can't hurt him now, you know. I never saw him Saturday. I think he were working. In the docks. He came in here last night, early. He had a couple of port and lemons. He said he was going up to the university. Why's that? He said his friends there would look after him. I just listened, of course. Did he name these friends? I doubt he really had any, chuff. Swift lied to us. He was there in the dock that night. If he saw what happened, that gives somebody a motive. Let's try the university. Is it true? I'm afraid so. Why did he do it? He didn't. You know, David once mentioned there are a lot of queer bashers about. And you can't go to the police, and the law doesn't protect you. The law is there to protect young lads from them. He WAS a young lad. Mr Hexton. May I look at your register for last night, please? Of course, sir. You a service to go to or something? Governors hearing, sir. Later on this afternoon. Right. Thank you very much. Good luck with that hearing. Thank you, sir, but I doubt I'll need it. Did either of you see David Swift up here yesterday? Yes. I saw him last night. Where did you see him? Back at the Prof's place. She had a bit of a scene going on. Dave was there. What time did you leave? I dunno. Well, I had a few. It was late, about 2 o'clock. Was David still there? I can't remember. When did you first confide to Professor Brown that you were carrying Barratt's child? On Saturday. In the pub after the demo. She overheard me telling Adriana. What was her reaction? She was furious. She told me to get rid of it. Was it her gave you that phone number? She told me if it didn't work she'd kick me down the stairs. I thought you'd be at the docks. We've another demo today. We still have business here. Was David Swift here last night? Yes. I, er... I think he still is... somewhere. Unlikely. He's dead. Really? What happened? How did he die? You tell us. 'He came round here last night. 'I couldn't tell you exactly what time. 'I wasn't expecting him.' David? Hiya. What are you doing here? I've been with the pigs. They've just let me go. Can I come in? Of course. Yeah. I thought maybes you could help me with the police. Darling, I'm too spaced right now. Just grab a pew and find yourself a drink. Hey, David. I'll stick to my ciggies. It's prime Kabul black. Widdershins! Pass to the left, man. Last time you saw him? Yes. You claim you were utterly opposed to Fraser Barratt's plan to blackmail David Swift. Yes, I was indeed. And the night he was killed you were celebrating with him in the Holborn. I was celebrating our demo. Not Fraser Barratt. What time did you leave the pub? I don't know. Closing time, probably. You were dead set against Elizabeth bearing Barratt's child. Excuse me, Inspector. Are you questioning me about my feelings or my actions? Just answer the question. You were against Elizabeth having his child. Not his child - any child! There are very few women with Elizabeth's potential. Any silly girl can have a baby. You and Fraser Barratt used to be lovers, didn't you? It's a very broad church, but... However, your affair lasted several years. You cared for him? I also hated him. Oh. Is that what you wanted me to say? You actually think I killed him? Followed him from the pub to confront him with his terrible betrayal of my love. You do, don't you? What, a barren woman, spurned for a younger one? The male arrogance of your deductive reasoning is really quite incredible. You see these journals? I have material published in every single one. I also have nine books published, one a novel. I have a citation from the Sorbonne. I have a paper to deliver to Harvard. I fly there next week. I then travel to New York to give a lecture. Unfortunately I don't have a child to nurse. Do you have children? No. A wife? Perhaps like me you made a decision to put your profession first. For a woman that rather means closing the door on domestic bliss. I don't ever regret it. The night of the demo. Your CND branch met here? Yes. Did you discuss Fraser Barratt's plan to get into the dockyard? We did, yes. Afterwards. He wouldn't budge. Where did this discussion take place? Here. After the committee meeting. Afterwards? Yes. Who was there? Just myself and Fraser. Nobody else? No. When I was doing my basic training we had a fellow from the Mosquitoes come and show us how to resist interrogation. He told us, "Name, rank, number. "Any other questions you block by saying, "'I have nothing to say to you', 'I have nothing to say to you'." Swift wasn't in the army, sir. No, but he knew somebody who was. One, two, three, four! We don't want a nuclear war! Mr Hexton? Guv. John. Careful, sirs. Stay well clear. Her mob of reds are going to ruin your crime scene, sir. It doesn't matter very much. We've gathered all our evidence. Ye knaa who killed Barratt? A young man down the docks saw everything that happened. Did he indeed? And now he's dead. But you know that, don't you? Be a man, Mr Hexton. I fought for each of these medals, ye knaa. I earned them! I don't doubt it. I'm as much a man as either of you. Without question. But God cursed me when he made me. He gave me a mortal sin I couldn't resist. A young squaddie I met... took me there one night. 'A year ago. 'I swore to myself I'd never go back.' 'I was more scared of going into that place than a jerry foxhole.' I work for British Rail, you know. Do you, Mr Jones? Aye. In, eh, Manchester. Each time I swore would be the last. Sometimes weeks'd go by without a blemish. But he discovered where you worked? Aye. He was coming to the college for reading classes or some such. 'But he never embarrassed me. 'He never acknowledged that he knew me.' 'But he did.' Then a few days ago... I heard the reds had a committee meeting. Just a moment. 'We have unfinished business.' Catch you down in the bar, chicklet. I'm begging you, Fraser, please don't go ahead with this. Why not? It's beautiful. I've been down to his queer club and everything. What a scene! 'They're all at it hammer and tongs.' 'I've got snaps en flagrante.' 'Of David?!' 'Yeah.' 'Grooving with these other geezers. Police would have him sewing mailbags the minute they set eyes on 'em.' You'll destroy him. Omelettes and eggs, my dear. 'Omelettes and eggs.' But I could hardly tell your mob what he intended, could I? It's all right for that lot to have free love. But not for chaps like me. Fraser, wait for me! Don't you love me any more? Of course I love you, pet. I just don't feel you right now. Charles! David. I've no time to stop. There's a fellow on his way here to try and obtain a copy of the gate key from you. Why? Never mind why. Just listen to me, David. You have to let him take the key. I can't do that. You can. There'll be no consequences. I'll make sure of that. He'll threaten to expose you. He has photographs. Of us? No... I don't know, David. Do this my way. Trust me. Hand him the damn key, or do whatever he asks. I will sort it all out. I won't leave you embarrassed. Charles? Well, well, well! Am I going to have some fun with this! Get in there. Eh? Stay inside. Oh, Charles! 'Didn't feel much for him.' Laddie! Shame of it is... ...The boy saw what happened. Then last night, long after you left. 'I was dozing in my armchair, half asleep.' All right, Charles? Whatever do you want? I've spent the day down Durham nick. In the cells. They thought I'd killed that Barratt fella. I see. I did it to protect you. I appreciate that, Charles. I didn't tell them nothing. I never said a word. Thank you. But if they bring me back in and charge me, I'm going to have to tell them something. I just need shot of Newcastle. Get out on a boat and I'll never be back. They'll find you. Not if I'm with you. You know how to get round the world. I want you to come with me. To do what? We can live how we want to. The world is changing, Charles! We could travel together, we could be ourselves. Are you mad, boy? Don't you want to be with me? Of course not! How dare you? Get out of my house! Don't you care about me? We had something... me and you. Shut up! Out of my house! Just leave! I will. I will, I'll go and I'll tell the police everything. No, you won't. Why not? You don't care about me! You won't! Ah, Charles! I thought you said you loved me. I did not. I did not! I did not! I did not! I...did... not. I'm sorry. Poor child. You know the rest. I waited till the wee small hours, I laid him on the rail tracks... ...Shed a tear for him... and meself. Don't try it, laddie! Get back! BACK! All right. Come on. Disgusting. Wherever will it end? No idea, sir. Shoes. In there. I want him watched like a hawk. He's a suicide risk. I doubt he'd have the guts, man. Don't. I thought you might use these. Thanks, lad. Will you give this to Lisa from me? If that's you want. Tell her, I'll go to court and I'll make a show of myself. She can get on with living her life. I'll tell her.
