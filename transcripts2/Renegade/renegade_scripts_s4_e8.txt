 Renegade (1992–1997): Season 4, Episode 8 - Offshore Thunder - full transcript 
 A well publicized death at a regatta gets Reno's attention when he sees his dead fiancée's sister on television. The death is ruled accidental but Reno investigates first hand, both to protect his friend, and because he suspects foul play. He finds that the death was no accident, and that the boat races are really a front to smuggle illegal weapons out of the country to supply a revolution.

TIM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DEBBIE, I CAN'T... I CAN'T HANG ON TO HER. TIM! HE WAS A COP AND GOOD AT HIS JOB BUT HE COMMITTED THE ULTIMATE SIN AND TESTIFIED AGAINST OTHER COPS GONE BAD-- COPS THAT TRIED TO KILL HIM BUT GOT THE WOMAN HE LOVED INSTEAD. FRAMED FOR MURDER, NOW HE PROWLS THE BADLANDS AN OUTLAW HUNTING OUTLAWS A BOUNTY HUNTER A RENEGADE. HEY, BUDDY, OLD PAL, BUDDY, OLD PAL I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WITH THE 500 CHANNELS OF THE FUTURE? I MEAN, THEY CAN'T EVEN FILL THE STATIONS THEY ALREADY HAVE. NOW, AS YOU KNOW I AM CONSTANTLY STRIVING TO KEEP THE SIXKILLER ENTERPRISES NAME IN THE PUBLIC EYE BY FUSING IN PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS THE WORD SIXKILLER WITH THE CONCEPT OF BOUNTY HUNTING IN AMERICA TODAY. YOU HAVE ANY DORITOS? CYNICISM IS SO EASY FOR YOU, RENO. YOU'VE TRIED BUS BENCHES, VIDEOTAPES... INFOMERCIALS. THOSE LITTLE PROPELLER BEANIES. SO NOT EVERY IDEA IS GENIUS. OKAY, WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE THIS TIME? I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME YOUR TRUE OPINION. LET IT FLOW WITH YOURSELF. LET IT GO THROUGH YOUR HAIR. ARE YOU READY? BIPLANE BANNERS. EXCUSE ME? BIPLANE BANNERS. PLANES CRUISING THE BEACH PULLING BANNERS? INTERACTING WITH THOUSANDS OF RICH, YOUNG DEMOGRAPHIC AMERICANS? AND WHAT'S YOUR BANNER GOING TO SAY? I ALSO WRITE MUSIC. I KNOW THAT. LIKE BURMA SHAVE. BEFORE MY TIME. ARE YOU READY? HERE IT GOES. ♪ GOT A FELON ON THE RUN ♪ ♪ SOME BAIL-SKIPPING WEASEL WITH A BLAZING GUN ♪ ♪ I FRET NOT, I SWEAT NOT ♪ ♪ HE'S IN THE CAN, 'CAUSE AT SIXKILLER ENTERPRISES ♪ ♪ WE GET OUR MAN. ♪ IT'S LIKE A RAP. YOU DON'T NEED A PLANE. YOU NEED AN AIR FORCE. WHAT FOR? TO TOW ALL THAT SIGNAGE. HOLD ON A SECOND. Just days away from the Offshore Thunder Challenge Cup Finals the favorite, Fiesta Boat flipped in a time trial killing champion race driver Tim Connor. WOW, THAT'S NASTY, HUH? YEAH. I'm with Juan Carlos Prieto owner of the Fiesta Special. It's tough losing your driver so close to the finals. Well, Tim was the best driver on the circuit. but what's most difficult is losing such a close, personal friend. Where does the Fiesta go from here? Well, we do have a second boat and we're dedicating the race to Tim. Now, excuse me. YOU KNOW WHAT I COULD DO? I COULD SHORTEN IT TO A SIXKILLER HAIKU. HOLD ON A SECOND. ...Prieto's crew readies the backup boat in time to compete. OH, MY GOD. WHAT? WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT? UH, MR. PRIETO. DEBBIE. I'M SO SORRY ABOUT TIM. IT'S JUST SO SAD, YOU KNOW? DON'T BLAME YOURSELF. YOU'RE THE BEST CREW CHIEF ON THE CIRCUIT. IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT. THANKS. I REALLY LIKED WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT "THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR TIM IS WIN THE RACE." A NICE SENTIMENT, PERHAPS BUT NOT VERY REALISTIC. I WAS JUST HAVING THE SECOND BOAT PUT IN THE WATER. I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE A GOOD CHANCE BUT I'LL KNOW MORE IN AN HOUR. WELL, TELL ME AS SOON AS YOU KNOW. OKAY. UM, MR. PRIETO? I DON'T THINK THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT. I MEAN, THE BOAT WOULD HAVE NEVER STUFFED LIKE THAT. MAYBE WIND SHEAR, MAYBE... NOT WITH TWO KNOTS OUT OF THE SOUTH. I THINK SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE FOOLED WITH THE BOAT. THE IMAGE TEAM? NO, THEY'RE GOOD COMPETITORS. BUT YOU KNOW, SOMETHING WAS BOTHERING TIM TODAY... BEFORE HE GOT IN THAT RUN... SOMETHING PERSONAL. DEBBIE... I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE ELSE, BUT... TIM HAD A GAMBLING PROBLEM. TIM? YOU'RE KIDDING. HE CAME TO ME AND ASKED FOR AN ADVANCE. I TOLD HIM NO. SO HE ASKED FOR A LOAN-- $50,000 CASH. WHO DID HE OWE THE MONEY TO? HE WOULDN'T SAY. WELL, HAVE YOU PICKED A NEW DRIVER? NOT YET. NOW I'VE GOT TO GET TO THE AIRPORT TO MEET HIS PARENTS. YEAH, OF COURSE. GOOD-BYE, DEBBIE. BYE. Reno: SORRY ABOUT YOUR FRIEND, DEB. EXCUSE ME? RENO? HI. MY GOD. IT'S REALLY YOU. THEY HAD THE CRASH ON TV AND I SAW YOUR FACE. JUST WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING HERE?! I WANTED TO SEE YOU. I THOUGHT YOU'D BE IN URUGUAY OR THAILAND OR MARS BY NOW AND THAT STILL WOULDN'T BE FAR ENOUGH. I'M SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU. WELL, NOW YOU'VE SEEN ME, OKAY? YOU BLAME ME FOR VAL. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT, I DO. DON'T YOU BLAME YOURSELF? THIS IS TOO CRAZY. WAIT. DON'T GO. WHERE DID YOU LEARN HOW TO DO THAT? FROM YOU, REMEMBER? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO, RENO? THROW MY ARMS AROUND YOU AND CALL YOU RENO-MAN, LIKE I USED TO? I WAS JUST HOPING... STOP HOPING! IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU MY SISTER WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. I WASN'T THE ONE THAT GOT HER KILLED. IT WAS A DIRTY COP THAT MADE HER DIE, NOT ME. HEY, DEB. IS THIS CREEP BOTHERING YOU? GET LOST. WE'RE OLD FRIENDS. YEAH? YEAH. COPS ARE RIGHT DOWN THE DOCK. I'LL GET ONE FOR YOU. NO THANKS, TONY. I WAS JUST LEAVING. IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND AND WANT TO TALK CALL ME THERE. SO WHAT, YOU'RE "VINCE BLACK" NOW? I'LL ALWAYS WANT TO TALK TO YOU, DEB. Debbie: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, SIS. FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS, I'VE DONE NOTHING BUT HATE HIM. THEN I SAW HIM TODAY, AND... AND IT ALL CAME BACK. LIKE THAT TIME THAT WE DROVE ALL NIGHT FROM MEXICO? EVEN WHEN HE HELPED ME BUY MY NEW CAR. MY FIRST CAR. THAT WARPED LITTLE SALES GUY, YOU REMEMBER? HOW SWEET HE WAS AND HOW MUCH HE LOVED YOU. I COULDN'T HATE HIM ANYMORE. I MEAN, IT WAS BAD ENOUGH LOSING YOU. I LOST HIM TOO. I JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH I MISSED HIM. YES, ANTIQUE AIRWAYS? YES, I WOULD LIKE SOME INFORMATION BECAUSE I'M VERY INTERESTED IN RENTING ONE OF YOUR BIPLANES FOR ADVERTISING. YES. HOW MUCH? HOW MUCH?! YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. ONE OF THOSE RICKETY OLD PLANES THAT'LL SKY THROUGH THE AIR LIKE THAT? I'LL CALL YOU BACK. SO, WOULD YOU LIKE TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU RAN OFF LIKE THAT? YEAH, REMEMBER THE BOAT CRASH FOOTAGE WE WERE WATCHING ON TV? MM-HMM. WELL, THE DARK-HAIRED GIRL THERE THAT WAS RUNNING THE PIT CREW? THAT'S VAL'S LITTLE SISTER, DEBBIE. YOU'RE KIDDING. WOW. WELL, DID YOU TALK TO HER? WELL, I TALKED TO HER, ALL RIGHT. BUT SHE DIDN'T DO MUCH LISTENING. SHE BLAMES YOU? I NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO EXPLAIN IT ALL TO HER AFTER VAL WAS SHOT, AND... THAT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM, THAT'S HERS. IT SURE FEELS LIKE MINE. I MEAN, SHE'S RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING: IF I'D NEVER MET VAL, SHE'D BE ALIVE TODAY. WHAT DID YOU DO WRONG, HUH? WHAT COULD YOU HAVE DONE DIFFERENT? IGNORE DUTCH DIXON? LET HIM GET AWAY WITH MURDER? NO. MAYBE IT WAS A MISTAKE FOR YOU TO FALL IN LOVE WITH VAL IN THE FIRST PLACE? THAT WAS NO MISTAKE. LOOK, RENO... THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN THE WORLD AND WHEN YOU STOP DOING THE RIGHT THING BROTHER, WE ARE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. THANKS. RENO. STILL WANT TO TALK? Debbie: I'M SORRY I MELTED DOWN WHEN I SAW YOU. IT'S BEEN A HELL OF A COUPLE DAYS. ACCEPTED AND FORGOTTEN. YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING THAT YOUR FRIEND WAS SAYING IN THERE IS TRUE. YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. IF I COULD GET VAL BACK I'D GLADLY GIVE MY OWN LIFE. I KNOW THAT. RENO, I NEED YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING. WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE CRASH. THERE'S WEIRD THINGS GOING ON. I NEED A COP'S EYES. WOULD YOU COME BACK TO THE PITS? YEAH, LET'S GO. OH, AND LET'S TAKE THAT GUY. HE COMES IN HANDY ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR. Bobby: OH, MAN, CHECK THIS OUT. THIS IS SO EXCITING. IT'S COLORFUL, YOU KNOW, THINGS HAPPENING? KIND OF LIKE ME. THEY EVEN GOT NEWS COVERAGE! WOW. HEY, IS THAT YOUR BOAT DOWN THERE? Debbie: NO, THEY'RE SPONSORED BY IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT. HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO HAVE A LOGO ON THE SIDE? IT DEPENDS ON HOW BIG IT IS AND WHERE IT GOES. EXCUSE ME? DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE WILLING TO HANG A REAL LONG SIGN ON THAT BOAT? WHAT DOES SHE DO? THAT'S A HOSPITALITY GIRL. EVERY SPONSOR GETS ONE. EVERY SPONSOR GETS ONE? I THINK I NEED A LITTLE MARKETING CONSULTATION. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I WAS AFRAID OF THAT. YOU THINK THE IMAGE BOYS WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO KILL TO WIN THE OFFSHORE CUP? NO, I CAN'T SEE IT. BUT MR. PRIETO DID TELL ME ONE WEIRD THING. YEAH, WHAT'S THAT? WELL, HE SAID THAT TIM HAD A GAMBLING PROBLEM AND THAT HE'D RUN UP SOME MAJOR DEBT AND WAS HITTING HIM UP FOR BAIL-OUT MONEY. THAT'S SAD, BUT NOT UNHEARD OF. TIM AND I WERE AS CLOSE AS SIAMESE TWINS. IF HE WAS GAMBLING, I WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT. WELL, WHAT ELSE COULD HE HAVE USED ALL HIS MONEY FOR? I DON'T KNOW. SO, PRIETO FUNDS ALL THIS? YEAH. EVER HEARD OF FIESTA FOODS? CHIPS AND DIPS? SALSA AND TORTILLAS? "MAKE EVERY MEAL A FIESTA." YEAH, THAT'S HIM. ILLEGAL MEXICAN IMMIGRANT TURNED SELF-MADE MILLIONAIRE. HE'S THE NICEST MAN IN THE WORLD. HE'S STOOD BEHIND THIS TEAM 100%. SO HE'S NOT A SUSPECT. NO. NO WAY. WHAT DO WE DO? I'D LIKE TO GET A LOOK AT THAT WRECKED BOAT BUT IN ORDER TO REALLY GET ME INSIDE YOU GOT TO WORK ME INTO THE OPERATION, SOMEHOW. YOU STILL GOOD WITH A TORQUE WRENCH? HEY, GUYS, WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO DO IT WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED? YOU COULDN'T DO ANY WORSE. HEY, DONNY HOW'S IT GOING? OKAY. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL THIS TIME? RECRUITING SOME NEW HELP. THIS IS... VINCE BLACK. WE MET. REMEMBER? VINCE AND I GO WAY BACK. HE'S AN ACE TUNER. HE'S HELPING FOR A WHILE. I DON'T THINK WE NEED HELP. I DO. HOPE YOU'RE GOOD. IT'S CALLED A SCREWDRIVER. THANKS. NICE GUY. ( knocking ) Reno: DEBBIE, IT'S ME. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? SOMEBODY TOOK OFFENSE AT MY SNOOPING. YOU GOT INSIDE THE SHED? YEAH, I GOT IN THERE, ALL RIGHT. THE TRIM TAB'S BEEN TAMPERED WITH. THE LINE WAS CUT. WE HAVE TO SHOW MR. PRIETO. THE BOAT'S GONE. WHOEVER CLOBBERED ME OVER THE HEAD CLEARED OUT THE SHED. IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE WITH FULL ACCESS CLEARANCE TO THE BOATS. WHAT? OH... SORRY, UM... JUST THAT VAL USED TO GET THE SAME LOOK. WELL, LOOK, UH... WHY DON'T YOU COME TO THE SPONSOR RECEPTION WITH ME THIS AFTERNOON. THINGS GET KIND OF WILD AND WOOLLY DOWN THERE SO, MAYBE WE CAN FIND SOMETHING OUT. DO I HAVE TO WEAR A TIE? NO. GOOD. ( loud pop music playing ) LAST TIME I SAW YOU IN ANYTHING MORE THAN A T-SHIRT WAS WHEN MOM CONNED YOU AND VAL INTO CHAPERONING MY SENIOR PROM. THAT WAS EVIL. AND YOU, THREATENING TO RUIN EVERYONE'S GOOD TIME BY SHOWING UP IN YOUR COP UNIFORM. BUT WE HAD FUN. REMEMBER? WE WATCHED THE SUN RISE OVER THE BAY. YEAH. YEAH, THAT WAS FUN. I'M GOING TO GET US SOME CHAMPAGNE. OKAY. DON. HEY, MAN. LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING FUN. ALWAYS. WE WERE BRAINSTORMING ON HOW TO PICK UP A LITTLE EXTRA SPEED ON THIS STICKY WATER. WHAT WAS EVERYBODY ELSE THINKING? THEY SAID TO OPEN THE AIR TRAPS FULL. I THOUGHT ABOUT DOING WORK TO THE CAVITATION PLATE. THERE YOU GO. THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM. THESE BOATS DON'T HAVE CAVITATION PLATES. HEY, DONNY. IT'S A PARTY. GO PARTY. YOU GOT YOURSELF A REAL CRACKERJACK MECHANIC HERE. ( Don chuckling ) AHOY, MATEYS. OH, LOOK, IT'S CAPTAIN CRUNCH. EAT YOUR HEART OUT. HELLO. HI. SO, WHERE'S PRIETO? BEHIND YOU, TOP OF THE STAIRS. Bobby: HOW DID HE BECOME BIG TORTILLA? HE WAS A MIGRANT WORKER WHO CONVINCED A GROWER TO LEND HIM 200 BUCKS TO MAKE FRESH SALSA. THE BUSINESS TOOK OFF. MY KIND OF GUY. I THINK I'LL GO TALK TO HIM. THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA. I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA. HE AND I ARE ALIKE. LIKE BROTHERS. WE'RE MEMBERS OF A VERY ELITE FRATERNAL ORGANIZATION. MEMBERS, NOW? YES. THE AMERICAN DREAM COME TRUE CLUB. MR. PRIETO, I PRESUME. ROBERT SIXKILLER, SIR AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I ADMIRE YOUR STYLE. OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES, I'M ALSO A SELF-MADE MAN MYSELF AND VERY INTERESTED IN OFFSHORE RACING. THAT'S A FANTASTIC SPORT. I'M EVEN THINKING ABOUT SPONSORING A BOAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? YOU'LL NEVER REGRET IT. IT'S LIKE HAVING A BEAUTIFUL MISTRESS. SHE BREAKS YOUR HEART, SHE BURNS YOUR WALLET BUT SHE GIVES YOU MOMENTS YOU'LL NEVER REGRET. YES. EXACTLY HOW MUCH DOES SHE BURN YOUR WALLET FOR? WELL, THE BOATS COST 8,500 TO RUN. SOUNDS REASONABLE. AN HOUR. AN HOUR. YOU HAVE TO REBUILD THE MOTORS AFTER EVERY TWO HOURS. THEY ONLY RUN FOR TWO HOURS? UH-HUH, AND THEN YOU NEED A SEMI TO TRANSPORT THEM. I DON'T SUPPOSE A WINNEBAGO WOULD WORK. UH, NO, NO, I'M AFRAID NOT. AND WE RACE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. NOT TO MENTION EUROPE. PLANE FARE FOR A BOAT. YES. WELL, LIKE I SAID, IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY. GOOD LUCK TO YOU, MY FRIEND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HOW MUCH ARE ONE OF THOSE LITTLE, BITTY PATCHES ON THE SIDE OF THE BOAT? CUTE DRESS. THANKS. YOU'RE WAY WRONG TO IGNORE ME, DEB. OH, AND HERE I THOUGHT I WAS LAVISHING ALL THIS ATTENTION ON YOU. YOU THINK I'M SOME GREASE MONKEY THAT'LL SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN THE WET PITS. NO! AREN'T YOU? I'M DOING SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE. I WANT YOU WITH ME. I DON'T WANT TO GO. DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER SAY, "HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU WON'T LIKE IT UNLESS YOU TRY IT?" DON'T BE RUDE. ( groaning ) LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE DOWN FOR THE COUNT. Prieto: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE? NOW, AS YOU KNOW, I WAS CONSIDERING FINDING ANOTHER WORLD-CLASS DRIVER. BUT INSTEAD, WE ARE PROMOTING FROM WITHIN THE RANKS. SO PLEASE MEET THE FIESTA SPECIAL'S NEW DRIVER DONNY CONLIN. ( applause ) Donny: I'D LIKE TO THANK MR. PRIETO FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. I'VE BEEN PREPARING MY WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS. YOU EVER NOTICE, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO A PARTY YOU GET INTO A BRAWL? I'M A NATURAL-BORN PUNCHING BAG. YOU LEARN ANYTHING? YEAH. THIS IS A SPORT FOR KINGS. YOU? NOTHING. AND WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. IF WE'RE TO FIND OUT ABOUT TIM I GOT TO PUT MYSELF IN HIS PLACE. YOU'RE NOT CONSIDERING DRIVING ONE OF THOSE? WHY NOT? YOU KNOW HOW FAST THEY GO AND THEIR COST? I'VE DRIVEN RACE CARS BEFORE. BESIDES, MY FRIEND HAD A FLAT-BOTTOM HYDRO. THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM. YOU'RE DELUSIONAL. THEY ALREADY HAVE A DRIVER. ( applause ) I'M SORRY. I JUST GOT JEALOUS AND WENT OFF ON DONNY. YOU WANT THE SECRET TRUTH? I LIKED HAVING YOU TAKE CARE OF ME. I LIKED IT TOO. YOU KNOW, VAL USED TO SAY THAT YOU WOULD TAKE CARE OF EVERYONE IN THE WORLD IF YOU COULD. AND IT DRIVES YOU CRAZY THAT YOU COULDN'T. VAL SAID THAT? YEAH. I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHE LOVED MOST ABOUT YOU. I MEAN, IT WAS SO HARD WHEN VAL DIED, YOU KNOW. AND I WANTED TO COME TO YOU FOR COMFORT BUT I JUST COULDN'T. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS JUST TO HAVE YOU PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME AND TO TELL ME THAT EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE OKAY AGAIN. I BETTER WALK YOU TO YOUR ROOM. NO. THAT'S OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING, OKAY? YEAH. OKAY. GOOD NIGHT, RENO. GOOD NIGHT. ( sighs ) HA, HA, HA! YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE? YOU'RE DONNY CONLIN. THE FASTEST BOAT DRIVER IN THE WORLD. COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR? COULD YOU GIVE ME AN AUTOGRAPH RIGHT OVER HERE IN MY AUTOGRAPH BOOK? RIGHT NEXT TO... CHECK IT OUT. BOBBY RAHAL, MAGIC JOHNSON. YOU MIND DOING THAT RIGHT THERE? COOL, MAN. GOD, GREAT. I CAUGHT YOU LAST NIGHT ON ONE OF THOSE VIDEO ROCK SPORTS SHOWS. YOU WERE CATCHING SOME AIR IN THAT BOAT. COOL! CHECK THAT OUT! IS THAT YOUR RIDE? THAT'S MINE. YOU NEVER BEEN IN ONE OF THOSE? WANT TO CHECK IT OUT? NEVER MIND ABOUT HER. COME ON, MAN. WHOO! HEY, YOU WANT TO DRIVE? HELL, I'VE ONLY BEEN BUGGING YOU FOR FOUR HOURS. COME ON, COME AROUND TO THIS OTHER SIDE HERE. HEY, WHAT ABOUT THAT CORNER BACK THERE, HUH? WHOO! ( clears throat ) HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING, MAN? LETTING YOU COMMUNE WITH NATURE. YOU'RE LEAVING ME. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. ( engine starting ) WHERE THE HELL COULD HE BE? HE'S GOT TO SHOW UP. RIGHT. WE'RE LOSING TIME. WE CAN'T MISS A DAY ON THE WATER. MR. PRIETO? I CAN DRIVE THIS BOAT. WHAT? UM, VINCE HAS EXPERIENCE. YEAH, I RACED UNLIMITED HYDROS UP PUGET SOUND. IT'S NOT THE SAME THING, BUT, UH... IT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THING. I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE MUCH CHOICE, SIR. BESIDES, IT'S JUST TIME TRIALS. SUIT UP. I STILL THINK YOU'RE NUTS. THAT'S FUNNY. BOBBY SAID THE SAME THING. THESE THINGS ARE A LOT BIGGER THAN UNLIMITED HYDROS. WELL, IF I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, I'LL ASK. ( engine chugging ) CLEAR. OKAY, GREAT START, VINCE. PERFECT HOLE SHOT. Prieto: YOU'VE GOT TO PUSH IT HARDER. VINCE, PULL THROTTLES DOWN. ROGER, DEBBIE, ROGER. SHE'S ROCKING LIKE CRAZY. STARTING TO CHINE. I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS MAN COULD DRIVE! WHAT DO I DO? TABS DOWN. DOWN! I'M TRYING. DEBBIE! OH, MY GOD, NO. Debbie: RENO! PAULIE! Race announcer: Get a rescue craft down there! The boat's come to a stop. There's no sign of the driver. Wait a minute! We see some bubbles coming up. There's the driver. He is safe. ( coughing ) Reno: AH... CAREFUL. YOU GOT THE BEDSIDE MANNER OF AN AUTO MECHANIC. I AM A MECHANIC. RIGHT THERE. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT ONE? I GOT THAT FROM THE MAN WHO REALLY KILLED YOUR SISTER. HE WAS A CON NAMED HOG ADAMS. WHY DO YOU DO IT, RENO? THIS OTHER COP NAMED DUTCH DIXON SPRUNG HIM FROM PRISON AND HIRED HIM TO KILL ME BUT VAL TOOK THE BULLET INSTEAD. THEN DIXON HAD HIM KILLED BEFORE HE COULD TESTIFY. YOU KNOW, I'VE HATED YOU FOR SO LONG. DEBBIE... NO, HEAR ME OUT. IT HELPED ME HAVING SOMEONE TO BLAME FOR VAL'S DEATH BUT NOW THAT I'VE GOT THE REAL YOU HERE I JUST FEEL LIKE I OWE YOU SO MUCH. YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING. SO, UM... YOU THINK SHE'D APPROVE? VAL... ...OF YOU AND ME. UM... ( knock at door ) I'LL GET IT. HI. HEY. HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. SO YOU THINK HE'LL MAKE IT OR WHAT? YEAH, I'M AFRAID SO. BUT I'LL MAKE SURE. WHAT'S THAT MEAN? IT MEANS YOU'RE FIRED. I CAN'T RISK LOSING YOU TOO. BUT WE'RE JUST GETTING SOMEWHERE. NO. YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT. I'M GOING TO FINISH THE RACE QUIT THE PRIETO TEAM AND WALK AWAY. DEBBIE, YOU CAN'T. OH, YEAH? WATCH ME. MAN, SHE IS JUST LIKE HER SISTER. COME ON, LET'S GO. GO WHERE? BACK TO THE RACE PITS. MY ACCIDENT WAS NO ACCIDENT. LOOK I KNOW YOU'VE NEVER DRIVEN A V-HAUL BEFORE, OKAY? IT WAS MECHANICAL. WHAT YOU DON'T REALIZE, YOU JUST GOT FIRED. I CAN'T LET HER LIVE WITH TIM'S DEATH ON HER CONSCIENCE. SHE'LL TAKE IT TO HER GRAVE. JUST LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE WE KNOW, HMM. LET'S GO. YOU ARE A VERY RESILIENT MAN, VINCE BLACK. MR. PRIETO. VINCE... I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU ON YOUR FEET. I'M FINE. WHY ARE YOU HERE? I CAME TO SEE YOUR BOAT. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE MY DRIVING MADE HER CHINE LIKE THAT. IT SO HAPPENS I AGREE. IT SEEMS THAT IN OUR RUSH TO GET HER RACE-READY SOMEONE FORGOT TO PUT FLUID IN THE OUTDRIVE. I KNEW IT. ACTUALLY, YOU DID A VERY NICE JOB CONTROLLING HER AS MUCH AS YOU DID. WOULD YOU CONSIDER KEEPING ME ON AS DRIVER? I'LL WIN THE RACE FOR YOU. IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO ME. WHY'S THAT? I'VE HAD MY SCRAPES WITH THE LAW. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN SOUR DEALS. I COULD USE A LUCKY BREAK. WELL, VINCE, I THINK YOUR LUCK IS CHANGING. WAIT. DON'T OFFER MY JOB TO THIS ROOKIE. GOOD OF YOU TO COME. DON'T BLAME ME, SIR. I WAS HAULED OUT TO THE DESERT AND BUSHWHACKED. WE ALL THOUGHT YOU CAVED IN UNDER THE PRESSURE. NOT DAMN LIKELY. SIR, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. ALONE. I BET YOU DO. HABLAMOS DESPUES, SENOR? COMO NO? RENO. HI. HI. GUESS WHO I JUST HAD A CONVERSATION WITH? WHO? VAL. WAS SHE TICKED OFF AT ME. GAVE ME A LECTURE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE. I KNOW HOW THAT GOES. WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT? COURAGE. AND FRIENDSHIP. WHAT WILL YOU DO? FOR OPENERS, I THOUGHT I'D TRY TO REHIRE YOU AGAIN. YOU'RE ON. NOW I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT A CONVERSATION. ABOUT WHAT? NOT HERE. HOP ON. ( groans ) YOU OKAY? YEAH. DIDN'T YOU AND VAL USED TO COME HERE? I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. THAT'S OUR SECRET. WELL... VAL COULD NEVER KEEP A SECRET. I WAS SO DAMN JEALOUS OF HER. DEBBIE, I STOPPED BY TO SEE... YOU KNOW, I... WHAT? IT'S OKAY, RENO. NO, IT'S NOT. NOT WITH ME. WHY, BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE THINKING OF HER WHILE YOU'RE KISSING ME? MAYBE THAT'S THE REASON. WELL, MAYBE I'M NOT THE JEALOUS TYPE. DEBBIE, I LOVED YOUR SISTER AND IT GOT HER KILLED. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS... SO WHAT NOW? YOU'RE MAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S DECISIONS FOR THEM? WELL, THAT COMES WITH THE TERRITORY. OKAY. I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL. LET'S JUST TAKE THINGS ONE AT A TIME... AND WHEN THE CASE IS OVER, WE'LL SEE WHERE WE STAND. OKAY. BUT... WELL... JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE MORE NIGHTS TO FANTASIZE, OKAY? SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR? I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW. PRIETO WAS IN THE CABIN LAST TIME I WAS HERE. IN THE CABIN? YEP. WHY WOULD HE BE IN THERE? YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE. I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM BEING MIXED UP IN THIS. WHOA. WHAT ARE THOSE? THEY CAN'T BE FOR EXTRA STRUCTURAL SUPPORT. THE WEIGHT WILL LOSE THE RACE. THEY'RE NOT FOR SUPPORT. DAMN RIGHT THEY'RE NOT. DONNY... WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? GET OUT. GET OUT! ANOTHER TWO MINUTES AND I'D HAVE BEEN OUT OF HERE. THEN WE'RE BOTH GLAD I MADE IT. IS THAT FOR ME? AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN. THEY'LL PROBABLY STILL BE SPENDING IT AFTER YOU'RE GONE. AND, UH, FOR ME? FINALLY. ARE YOU GOING TO BLOW UP YOUR OPPONENT'S BOAT? I NEED TO TEST THEM. NO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? I'M CURIOUS. THEY'RE FOR MY VILLAGE IN MEXICO. WHAT, THEY A LITTLE TICKED OFF AT THE TOURISTS DOWN THERE? MY VILLAGE IN CHIAPAS. OH, THE ZAPATISTAS. I GOT YOU. REVOLUTION-- THE NEW HOBBY OF A SELF-MADE MILLIONAIRE. PLEASE. I TRY NOT TO GET BOGGED DOWN IN POLITICS. LOAD IT. SO, BEING FIESTA KING'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU, HUH? YOU WANT TO BE THE REAL KING. THE REBELS ARE MY FAMILY, MR. WEIR. THEY'RE MY BROTHERS. MY COUSINS. MY NIECES. WE SPENT OUR LIVES FIGHTING AN OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT. IT'S NOT A JOKE. NO, I DIDN'T MEAN TO... SHOW ME HOW THIS WORKS. ABSOLUTELY. OKAY. THESE ARE MOST IMPRESSIVE ON A MOVING TARGET. THE MISSILE IS WIRE-GUIDED. YOU KEEP YOUR OBJECTIVE IN YOUR SIGHTS THERE. THE LAUNCHER SENDS ALL THE INFO TO A LITTLE COMPUTER ON THE ROCKET. YOU FIRE WITH THAT TRIGGER. AND... ( gunfire ) THIS WILL DO JUST FINE. Announcer: The crowd getting excited about these two teams. They are extremely fast. Look at them flying on the back part of that course. Harry Bell, one of the top drivers on the West Coast and running third in this unlimited hydro heat. DON'T BOTHER, DEBBIE. YOUR WRISTS WILL GIVE OUT BEFORE THOSE ROPES DO. DONNY... I DON'T GET IT. WHY WOULD HE RESORT TO MURDER JUST TO DRIVE A STUPID RACE? IT'S NOT ABOUT A RACE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THOSE RACKS ON THE BOW OF THE BOAT? I'VE SEEN THEM BEFORE. WHERE? ARMY RANGERS. THEY USE THEM TO TRANSPORT MISSILES. OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS. HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS JUAN CARLOS PRIETO? NO WAY, RENO. I TOLD YOU, HE'S A WONDERFUL GUY. WHO WAS BORN IN A MEXICAN PROVINCE, RIGHT? CURRENTLY LOADED WITH REVOLUTIONARIES. HE'D RISK LOSING AN EMPIRE IF HE WAS CAUGHT SMUGGLING WEAPONS. I DOUBT U.S. CUSTOMS WILL BOTHER CHECKING OUT A COUPLE OF HIGH-PROFILE BOATS LIKE THAT. IT'S PROBABLY WHY HE CHOSE THE SPORT. We are just moments away from the start of the race. BUT BE CAREFUL. DON'T GET COCKY AND TRY TO WIN. HEY, YOU THINK I'M CRAZY? I KNOW YOU'RE CRAZY. IT'S WHY WE'RE PARTNERS, NO? Getting some last minute instructions, no doubt. This is a very important race. A lot riding on young Conlin's shoulders. Just a few moments away, we'll get started on this final race of the day as the two top qualifiers go head to head. The finale of the Offshore Thunder Challenge Cup finals here in Mission Bay. WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME! HOW DID YOU FIND US? WELL, KIND OF STRANGE THE CREW CHIEF WOULD BE OUTSIDE THE PITS ON RACE DAY, HUH? ALSO SAW YOUR HARLEY OUTSIDE. They like this racing action, they like these boats. HAVE THE BOATS LEFT THE SLIP YET? TAKING OFF RIGHT NOW. COME ON. We're set to go for the start. HE'S GOING TO GET AWAY, RENO. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME WAY TO CATCH HIM. THERE'S NOTHING FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH IT. MAYBE IN THE AIR. KENNY, GIVE MY FRIEND A RIDE AND I'LL GIVE A STORY YOU'LL NEVER FORGET. OKAY, GET IN. The boats on the water. There's the flag. The pace boat is along to the side and there it is! There's the start! BREAK A LEG, SENOR. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? THE RACE HAS STARTED. SAVE IT, PRIETO. TELL ME WHAT KIND OF MISSILES YOU HAVE. STINGERS, COBRAS, DRAGONS? WITH THE WORLD GETTING SO PEACEFUL WEAPONS HAVE BECOME A BUYERS MARKET. AS A MATTER OF FACT I GOT A VERY GOOD DEAL ON THIS ONE. FANTASTIC SPORT! ( grunts ) WHERE'S RENO? HE'S UP THERE IN THE HELICOPTER. COME ON! WHAT'S HAPPENING? HOLD ON! HERE, HERE! ( grunts ) ( engine stops ) YOU WOULD HAVE LOST THE RACE ANYWAY, DONNY. WAY TOO MUCH WEIGHT IN THE BOW. WHOO! WELL, PRIETO WILL GO DOWN FOR TIM'S MURDER. ADD THE SMUGGLING CHARGES TO THAT AND HE'LL BE GONE FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. I WISH I COULD HAVE SEEN DONNY'S FACE WHEN THE COPS FOUND HIM HANDCUFFED ON THE BEACH. I WISH I WOULD HAVE HUNG AROUND MYSELF. SO, NOW THAT IT'S OVER YOU CAN ANSWER MY QUESTION. WHAT QUESTION? YOU KNOW WHAT QUESTION. DO YOU THINK VAL WOULD APPROVE IF YOU AND I HAD A RELATIONSHIP? I THINK VAL WOULD HAVE WANTED YOU TO BE HAPPY AND HAVE ALL THE GOOD THINGS IN LIFE: FAMILY, KIDS, HOME. SAFETY, SECURITY. I CAN'T GIVE YOU THOSE THINGS. WHAT ABOUT WHAT I WANT? I THINK THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT. YEAH. TAKE CARE, LITTLE SISTER. RIDE SAFE, BIG BROTHER.
