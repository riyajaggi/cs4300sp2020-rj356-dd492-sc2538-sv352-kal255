WE GOT INTO A BIDDING WAR OVER SOME STUPID THING AND I WON. SHE WANTED IT. SO I GAVE IT TO HER. YOU? I KNEW SHE WAS SPECIAL, EVEN WAY BACK THEN. AFTERWARD, I, UH...

A YEAR AND A HALF. BEST YEAR AND A HALF OF MY LIFE. WELL, WHAT HAPPENED? ( sighing ) WELL WE HAD BEEN DATING FOR ABOUT A YEAR. THEN HER EX-FIANCE CAME OUT LOOKING FOR HER. THIS, UH, PETER MARIN. LITTLE BY LITTLE, HE WAS PULLING HER BACK TO HIM. HE HAD SOME STRANGE KIND OF POWER OVER HER. DIDN'T SHE SEE IT? YEAH, SHE SAW IT. SHE KNEW IT WAS WRONG. SHE JUST WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL AWAY. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN TOUGH TO WATCH. THEY WERE MARRIED FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AGO. EXCEPT FOR THOSE CHRISTMAS CARDS I HAVEN'T HAD CONTACT WITH HER UNTIL THIS WEEK. ( phone ringing ) HI. VINCE. OH, HELLO, BRANDY. It seems you've caught somebody's eye. REALLY? A first-timer. A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE. YOU SHOULD BE PAYING ME. WHAT'S THE DEAL? Meet her at the bar of the Concord in an hour.

ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING TO DO IT. DOMINIQUE... I SAID NO TALKING. STOP. I'M NOT A GIGOLO. YEAH, AND I'M NOT A FRUSTRATED HOUSEWIFE. I MEAN IT. WHAT ARE YOU? A COP? NO, BUT THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN HERE TONIGHT. YOU LOUSY, ROTTEN... LOOK, I'M SORRY, OKAY? I'M HELPING A WOMAN THAT WAS VICTIMIZED. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M TALKING ABOUT BRANDY AND HER GANG. THEY HAVE A CRIME RING. THEY SET PEOPLE UP JUST LIKE YOU AND THEN THEY ROB THEM. OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE KIDDING. THEY TAKE PICTURES-- DAMAGING PICTURES-- AND THEN THEY USE THEM AGAINST THE PERSON, AND BLACKMAIL THEM. I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. I WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT THEY DID TO THIS WOMAN. SHE GOT HERSELF INTO IT SHE CAN GET HERSELF OUT OF IT. DOMINIQUE, PLEASE. OH, MY GOD. NOW, IF YOU DON'T HELP THIS WOMAN'S GOING TO LOSE HER CHILDREN TO A MAN WHO'LL DESTROY THEM. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO? GIVE BRANDY A GOOD REPORT ON ME. TELL HER, UH, I WAS SENSATIONAL. I DON'T KNOW. LISTEN, I'VE GOT TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. ( door shuts ) HEY..! HEY! WHY DID YOU RIP OUR BUG OUT? I'M SHY. I DON'T LIKE STRANGERS LISTENING IN. IS THAT HOW YOU BOYS GET YOUR KICKS? NO, FOOL. THAT'S HOW WE GET OUR INFORMATION. NOW, IT'S MY TURN TO ASK THE QUESTIONS. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, MAN. I CAN SMELL A SCAM A MILE AWAY. WHAT AM I DOING TALKING TO YOU? YOU'RE THE MUSCLE. YOU TELL THE BRAINS I WANT HIM. WELL, THANKS, HON. YEAH, UM, I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON. SO HOW WERE MY REVIEWS? PACINO'S NEVER HAD BETTER. I WAS GETTING A LITTLE HOT AND BOTHERED MYSELF. WHAT WOULD BIG AL SAY? ALAN TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR CONVERSATION. I DON'T LIKE YOU MESSING WITH HIM. DON'T DO IT. FINE. AND WHY'D YOU TAKE THAT MIKE OUT ANYWAY? I LIKE MY PRIVACY. SO, YOU GOING TO CUT ME IN ON YOUR ACTION? YOU'RE A LITTLE PUSHY. I CAN'T AFFORD TO BE POLITE. I'VE GOT TWO VICIOUS EX-CONS AFTER ME AND THEY WANT THEIR MONEY NOW. VERY POIGNANT... BUT I'M A BUSINESS WOMAN AND I ONLY TAKE PRUDENT RISKS. HEY, COME ON I'VE DELIVERED FOR YOU. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT? HAVE A SEAT. Then on the next date they take the client to the special suite. RIGGED TO PHOTOGRAPH THE INDISCRETIONS FOR POSTERITY. Or more precisely, her husband's. Then they hold the woman's feet TO THE FIRE-- JUST LIKE THEY DID WITH LIZA. I'M READY TO GO WITH MY SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN AND TEAR THOSE PICTURES AWAY FROM THEM. THAT WON'T PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. This is going to work. WELL, IT BETTER. So what do we do now? HOPE I GET A SECOND DATE. SOMEHOW, I DON'T THINK THAT'LL BE A PROBLEM. HI. I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THAT ENTHUSIASTIC REPORT. WELL, THE ENTHUSIASM WAS EASY. UM, LISTEN, CAN I TALK TO YOU? SURE. BUT NOT HERE, OKAY? OKAY. SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THAT MR. BLACK. WHY? 'CAUSE HE'S JUST A LITTLE TOO GOOD. THE TRUTH IS I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH MY HUSBAND. BUT THAT DAMN JOB'S THE ONLY THING HE HAS TIME FOR. IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD IDEA TO MAKE HIM A LITTLE JEALOUS, DON'T YOU THINK? VINCE... I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT BEING UNFAITHFUL. ALL I'M SAYING IS GIVE HIM SOMETHING... TO MAKE HIM THINK A LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW? MAKE HIM SEE... WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE DOES. THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE THAT KEPT ME AWAKE LAST NIGHT. AND WHAT'S THAT? THE WOMAN THAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT. MM... I WANT TO HELP HER. IT'S RISKY. WELL, THAT'S A RISK I'M WILLING TO TAKE. THEN HIRE ME AGAIN. I NEED MORE TIME, BRANDY. THIS BLACK'S A TOTAL MYSTERY MAN. WHERE DOES HE LIVE? I COULDN'T FIND OUT. DID YOU CHECK THE APPLICATION AT THE HEALTH CLUB? HE GAVE HIS ADDRESS AS A HOTEL. THEY SAY HE'S NOT REGISTERED. HOW DID HE PAY FOR HIS MEMBERSHIP-- CHECK OR CREDIT CARD? I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T CHECK.
