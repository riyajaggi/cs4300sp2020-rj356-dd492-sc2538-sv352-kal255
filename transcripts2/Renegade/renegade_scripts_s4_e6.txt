 Renegade (1992â€“1997): Season 4, Episode 6 - Dead Heat - full transcript 
 Reno poses as a ranch hand once again, and uncovers a plot where con artists are selling illegitimate horses as supposed top thoroughbreds. What makes things worse is that once the sale is made and the money is collected, the animals are killed. This is done to destroy any evidence of wrongdoing before the buyers suspect anything. Reno has to determine who is in on the scam and who is just an innocent bystander before exposing the operation.

I MUST SAY, YOU HAVE QUITE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE HERE. HMM, IT WAS MY LATE HUSBAND'S WHEN I MARRIED HIM. EVERYBODY SAID WHAT A TERRIFIC GUY HE WAS. IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO BE TRUE. HOW LONG AGO DID HE DIE? FIVE MONTHS AGO. THERE WERE TIMES I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT. HELL, LET'S BE HONEST. I ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT. I'M SORRY. HORSES... HORSES WERE FRANK'S PASSION. I ONLY GOT INTERESTED IN THEM AFTER HIS DEATH... AS A WAY OF CONNECTING, I GUESS. ( car approaching ) VINCE, YOU GOT TO COME SEE. WHAT'S THAT? MY NEW HORSE, TEMPTRESS. COME ON. ALL RIGHT, LOOK OUT.

MAYBE IF THEIR HORSE WERE WORTH MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE. OH, GREAT. BRAINTEASERS. AND GET THIS. THE VET SAID THAT SAMARRA DIED OF COLIC BUT THE EXERCISE GIRL SAID HE NEVER HAD COLIC A DAY IN HIS LIFE. THERE'S SOME VOODOO STUFF GOING ON AROUND HERE. YOU HEAR ANYTHING FROM THE SANDMAN? I THINK I RAN INTO HIM LAST NIGHT THEN GOT INTO TROUBLE, AND... I LOST HIM. I'D BETTER GET BACK BEFORE THEY MISS ME. WHAT ABOUT THIS JOB? HOW'S IT GOING? WHAT HAVE THEY GOT YOU DOING? LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY: I'M GLAD I HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE TO FALL BACK ON. HOW'S SHE LOOK? SHE'S A LITTLE SKITTISH. Sam: WE'LL SEE HOW SHE RUNS. NICOLE... GO! LOOK AT HER MOVE, SAM. THE CLOCK WILL TELL US, MRS. MACK. 18 AT THE HALF. NOT BAD. 40.4. WELL, IF I'D JUST RIDDEN NINE HOURS ON THE TRAILER I WOULDN'T FEEL MUCH LIKE RUNNING EITHER. STILL WANT TO RUN HER TOMORROW, MRS. MACK? OH, ABSOLUTELY, SAM. LET HER GET A RACE UNDER HER BELT. IT MIGHT BE SMARTER TO LET HER GET ACCLIMATED. HOLD HER UP FOR A FEW WEEKS. NO, BROCK. I WANT TO SEE HER RUN. TAKE HER IN, BILLIE. YOU COMING? NO. I'LL BE JUST A SECOND. I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY WITH TEMPTRESS. OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH. I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO TAPES. MOVE. THAT'S ENOUGH, VINCE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE? SOME GUY WAS SNEAKING AROUND, SO I THOUGHT I'D KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. WHAT DID YOU SEE? NOTHING, UNFORTUNATELY. I LOST HIM A WAYS BACK. GOOD WORK. I THOUGHT I SAW SOMEONE TOO. SO, WE FOLLOWED HIM OUT HERE. LET US KNOW IF YOU SEE HIM AGAIN. YOU'RE MAKING YOURSELF INVALUABLE AROUND HERE PRETTY DAMN QUICK. JUST GRATEFUL FOR THE CHANCE. COME ON, CHEKA. WHERE THE HELL YOU BEEN? JUST HAD AN AUTOPSY DONE ON SAMARRA. THAT EXERCISE GIRL WAS RIGHT. HE DIDN'T DIE OF COLIC; HE WAS ELECTROCUTED. OH, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. YOU RUN AN AUTOPSY ON THE BRAIN DEATH BY ELECTROCUTION LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE DYING OF COLIC. I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH CHEY. SHE SAID THOSE PEDIGREE PAPERS ARE A MASTER FORGERY. SAMARRA ISN'T SAMARRA? MY GUESS: THAT HORSE IS A MUTT. SHE'S RUNNING A CHECK ON BROCK HUNTER. SO HOW DOES THIS WORK? HE BUYS HORSES CHEAP, FORGES THE PAPERS? TATTOOS IT WITH THE RIGHT NUMBERS. THEN SETS UP RICH WIDOWS? WHY KILL THE HORSE? HE'S MADE HIS PROFIT WITH THE SALE AND THE WIDOWS GET THE INSURANCE MONEY. MAYBE SELF-DEFENSE. KILLS THE HORSE BEFORE ANYBODY REALIZES IT'S A DOG. THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER POSSIBILITY, RENO. MAYBE HE SEDUCES THE WIDOWS INTO BEING HIS ACCOMPLICES. DONNA McKENZIE PAID 200 GRAND FOR THAT ANIMAL. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. MAYBE SHE DIDN'T PAY A DIME. MAYBE SHE'S IN ON IT COLLECTING THE INSURANCE MONEY TOGETHER. I DON'T BUY IT. SHE'S HEAD OVER HEELS FOR THIS GUY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE MAY DO FOR THIS MAN. NOT KILL HORSES, NOT THIS LADY. ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE AN EXPERT ON THIS LADY? BOBBY, I SAW HER FACE WHEN SHE WAS WATCHING THAT NEW FILLY RUN. HORSES ARE HER LIFE. THAT'S ALL SHE... WHAT? OH, MAN. WHAT?! HUNTER SET UP DELIVERY OF THE NEW FILLY. ARE YOU GOING TO TELL HER EVERYTHING? NOT UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE HOW ALL THESE PIECES FIT TOGETHER. ( engine starting ) COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. COME ON. WHERE THE HELL YOU BEEN? UH, JUST GRABBING SOME LUNCH. YEAH? WELL, WE'RE LOADING TEMPTRESS FOR THE TRACK. LET'S GO. QUIT IT! QUIT IT. STOP IT. COME ON IN. QUIT IT. WHOA... WHOA... SETTLE DOWN. WHOA. SETTLE DOWN. COME ON. ( whinnying ) WHOA. GET HER LOADED UP. WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER WITH YOU! HOW'D YOU LET THAT HORSE GET AWAY FROM YOU?! YOU JUST SENT ERNESTO OVER TO HELP ME. THAT HORSE IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. WILL YOU TAKE IT EASY. IT WASN'T HER FAULT. STAY OUT OF THIS. YOU'RE FIRED. FINE! WAIT A MINUTE. MIND YOUR OWN DAMN BUSINESS. WHY DO YOU PICK ON HER? YOU'RE FIRED TOO! ARE WE GETTING IN YOUR WAY HERE? IF YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY, SAY IT. YOU HURTING THESE HORSES? COME ON, BOY. YOU'VE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS. I'M NOT FIGHTING YOU. WATCH IT. THAT WAS CLOSE. THAT CLOSE ENOUGH? STOP! STOP IT! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU TWO? SAM... SAM... WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? EITHER HE GOES OR I DO. WHAT HAPPENED HERE? THEY WERE LOADING TEMPTRESS UP AND SHE SPOOKED AND BROKE THROUGH THE FENCE. OH, MY GOD, IS SHE ALL RIGHT? SHE'S FINE. VINCE, WAS THIS AN ACCIDENT? WHAT ELSE COULD IT HAVE BEEN? WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON AROUND HERE I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER. DONNA... DONNA. HEY. HI. VINCE. MR. HUNTER. VINCE, YOU STARTED TO SAY SOMETHING. WELL, IT'S OKAY. BROCK AND I DON'T HAVE ANY SECRETS. WELL, I JUST WANTED TO PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR BILLIE. SHE'S A REAL GOOD HAND. BE A SHAME TO SEE HER FIRED. BILLIE'S PART OF OUR FAMILY. SHE'D NEVER GET FIRED. SAM JUST DID. WELL, THAT HAPPENS ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK. HE BLAMES HER FOR EVERYTHING. VINCE, SAM IS BILLIE'S FATHER. OH. WELL, I'M SORRY I WASTED YOUR TIME. HEY, NO, NO. WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN. I'D BETTER BE GETTING BACK. HEY. THANKS FOR STICKING UP FOR ME TODAY. THAT DON'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME SAM WAS YOUR DAD? WELL, I TRY TO KEEP THAT EMBARRASSING LITTLE FACT A SECRET. LOOK, SAM'S NOT THAT BAD. I MEAN, HE'S JUST UPSET AND FRUSTRATED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. WAS HE EVER IN ANY TROUBLE WITH THE LAW? ONCE... I THINK, A LONG TIME AGO. HMM. WHAT FOR? I DON'T KNOW. HE DOESN'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT. AND NEITHER DO I. HERE. I FORGIVE YOU. WHAT'S THIS? MY ADDRESS. DINNER'S ON THE TABLE AT 7:00 SHARP. YOU COME HUNGRY. Brock: THIS VINCE BLACK GUY KNOWS. HE WAS THAT CLOSE TO TELLING DONNA. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM. PONIES AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN MEET AN UNFORTUNATE DEMISE. THEN IT'S GOT TO BE NOW, TONIGHT. YOU'RE ACTING LIKE YOU GOT COLIC. OH, IT'S SO EASY FOR YOU TO BE NONCHALANT. THEY KNOW WHO I AM. MY NAME IS ALL OVER THIS THING. STOP WHINING. IF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR COOL WE'LL GET OUT OF THIS COZY. UNDERSTAND? OKAY. BUT THIS HORSE I SOLD HER-- IT'S A REAL DOG. WE CAN'T LET HER RUN ONE SINGLE RACE. FINE. SHE'S PURINA-BOUND. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT, HOWARD? TEMPTRESS IS AT THE TRACK ALREADY. I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU. I'VE ARRANGED SOME SECLUDED QUARTERS WHERE WE CAN WHACK HER GOOD. JUST LEAVE IT IN MY CAPABLE HANDS. OKAY. EXCEPT THERE'S ONE THING I GOT TO TAKE CARE OF, MYSELF. WHAT'S THAT? IT'S DONNA McKENZIE. OH. AFFAIRS OF THE HEART. NOT MY DEPARTMENT. I SUCKED THAT SAP DRY. ( laughing ) AND I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND ONE MORE SECOND WITH HER. AND THEY SAY CHIVALRY IS DEAD. ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE DEAL: WE HAVE OUR LITTLE DAY AT THE RACES WE 86 THE FILLY AND... WE PUT MR. BLACKWELL TO SLEEP, ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. AND, HEY DON'T WORRY. IT'LL BE A BLAST. BROCK. I THOUGHT WE WERE MEETING AT THE TRACK. DONNA, IT'S MY FATHER. TELL ME. MY BROTHER CALLED. HE AND MY FATHER RUN THE FAMILY BUSINESS BACK IN OHIO. IS YOUR FATHER SICK? NO, BUT APPARENTLY THEY'RE IN TROUBLE-- SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE WITH THE BUSINESS-- AND MY FATHER'S FALLING APART. OH, BROCK. MY BROTHER SAYS HE'S SUICIDAL. I'VE GOT TO GET BACK THERE. WELL, OF COURSE YOU DO. DONNA, MY PLANE LEAVES IN AN HOUR. NOW, I COULD BE WEEKS... EVEN MONTHS. WELL, YOU TAKE AS LONG AS YOU NEED. I'LL BE HERE. THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR. ( sighs ) MRS. McKENZIE. HI. I JUST WANTED TO STOP BY TO WISH YOU LUCK TODAY. THANK YOU, VINCE. IF RACES WERE WON BY OWNERS YOU'D BE IN WINNER'S CIRCLE EVERY AFTERNOON. ARE YOU OKAY? NOT REALLY. BROCK HAD TO LEAVE TOWN SUDDENLY AND... ( sobbing ) I'M SORRY. I MUST SEEM LIKE SOME HYSTERICAL WOMAN. NOT AT ALL. WELL... GOOD LUCK TODAY. CAN YOU COME TO THE RACES WITH ME TODAY? HOLD ME UP IN CASE I CRUMBLE? I'D BE HONORED BUT... UM... OH.

Lilac Lady towards the center, showing good speed and Harvest Color on the outside goes out to lead them. Damascus Fool is tucking in just behind the leaders and Cover the Bet going to be forced to go a little wide. Battle Weary, content to trail ten lengths off. Past the stands, first time round and Harvest Color and Lilac Lady out there showing a good speed on the lead... HI. I FEEL BETTER ALREADY. It's going to be a photo.

Wednesday Bingo is in the back of the field as they come past the stands first time round... KEEP GOING. KEEP GOING. IS HE GOING TO MAKE A MOVE? Scott's Bride, on the outside is third, then back to Sudden Poison. Leviathan is dropping about eight lengths off the leaders. Behind that comes Wednesday Bingo driving with 20 lengths to make up. Down the back stretch they go and Loose Cannons shows the way. Red's Darling in second. Scott's Bride on the outside and Leviathan moves into contention as they swing for home. Homeward Bound and Loose Cannons bellied up but Leviathan is... YES! YES! YES! Leviathan is coming home powerfully on the outside. Loose Cannons's trying to hang on... YES!
