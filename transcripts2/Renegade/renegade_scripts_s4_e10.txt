 Renegade (1992â€“1997): Season 4, Episode 10 - Another Place and Time - full transcript 
 A mafia prince is murdered in broad daylight. The assassin is so well connected that he is virtually untouchable. Reno and Cheyenne pose as a couple on honeymoon, since they feel that Cheyenne is the only way to lower his guard and get close to him. They must catch him before he leaves the country. While trying to catch the killer, Reno and Cheyenne get dangerously close, and begin falling in love.

WELL, EVER SINCE WE GOT HERE ALL WE'VE DONE IS FIGHT. OH, WELL, I'M SURE YOU'RE JUST HAVING YOUR FIRST SPAT. FIRST, SECOND, THIRD. AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE MOST ROMANTIC TRIP OF MY LIFE. IT STILL MIGHT BE. I CALLED YOU AS SOON AS I HEARD. NOT SOON ENOUGH. YOU'RE FLIRTING WITH A MARRIED WOMAN. I NEVER FLIRT. WHAT'S THIS FOR? I'D BE HONORED IF YOU'D JOIN ME FOR A NIGHTCAP. THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK MY HUSBAND WOULD APPRECIATE IT. OH, WHAT'S WRONG WITH A LITTLE AFTER-DINNER DRINK?

I SPENT ALL EVENING TRYING TO GET IT! WE WEREN'T READY. SAYS WHO? IF YOU'D GONE UP TO HIS PENTHOUSE HOW WOULD YOU GET OUT BEFORE MORNING? I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. CHEY, THIS ISN'T A PROM DATE. THIS GUY IS A STONE KILLER. HE KILLED HIS COUSIN AND HE'LL KILL YOU. SO WHAT DO WE DO, GO HOME? I DIDN'T SAY THAT. CALL ME CRAZY BUT I THINK THE ROMANTIC MOOD HAS BEEN SPOILED. WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE GOING TO GET HIM TO APOLOGIZE. APOLOGIZE? FOR RUINING YOUR HONEYMOON. GET HIM TO MAKE A DATE WITH YOU. I THOUGHT YOU SAID I WASN'T SAFE WITH HIM. IN BROAD DAYLIGHT WITH ME AND BOBBY BACKING YOU UP. YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS. NAH. PERSONAL INVITATION FOR MR. SPANO. LISTEN TO ME FOR JUST 30 SECONDS WE CAN GET THIS ENTIRE THING STRAIGHTENED OUT. CHEYENNE. THIS IS A NICE SURPRISE. LET ME GET YOU A DRINK. I WISH I COULD STAY BUT MY HUSBAND'S NOSE WON'T STOP BLEEDING THANKS TO YOUR GORILLAS. HE DESERVED IT. WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION TO RUIN MY HONEYMOON? NO ONE-- I'M SINCERELY SORRY FOR THAT. MY HUSBAND STILL HAS A BLOODY NOSE. I'LL COMP YOUR ROOM FOR YOUR STAY. HOW'S THAT? WE'RE LEAVING TOMORROW. YOUR HUSBAND SEEMS TO BE IN A HURRY. ACTUALLY, IT WAS MY IDEA. THINGS AREN'T GOING TOO SMOOTHLY. THEN MAYBE YOU'LL STAY FOR THAT NIGHTCAP. THEY'RE WATCHING US. WHO? I DON'T LIKE AN AUDIENCE. YEAH, WELL, YOU'LL GET USED TO THEM. NO, THANKS. I'LL BE AT THE POOL IN THE MORNING IF YOU WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE. I'LL BE THERE. CHEYENNE... I'M GOING TO DREAM ABOUT YOU. Cheyenne: ONCE WE'RE IN THE PENTHOUSE I CAN LOSE THE MUSCLE. IF YOU CLEAR A PATH TO THE LOBBY WE'LL BE HOME FREE. BOBBY SAID THEY HAVE SECURITY GUARDS AT EVERY ELEVATOR. PIECE OF CAKE FOR YOU. WELL, THEN, I GUESS WE SHOULD GET SOME REST. I'LL TAKE THE COUCH. NO, I'LL TAKE THE COUCH. I'M USED TO SLEEPING ON THE GROUND. RENO, YOU THREW YOUR BACK OUT LAST MONTH-- REMEMBER-- WHEN YOU CARRIED THAT GUN SMUGGLER? YEAH, BUT YOU SPRAINED YOUR SHOULDER, RIGHT? WELL, WHAT ABOUT THAT KNIFE WOUND YOU GOT? THAT'S ALL HEALED. HEALED! LOOK, I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE. NO, YOU'RE NOT. CHEY, THIS IS MY PILLOW. NOW, GET IN THAT BED. WAIT A SECOND. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. WHAT? WE'RE IN A BIG HONEYMOON SUITE AND WE'RE HAVING A FIGHT OVER WHO GETS TO SLEEP ON THE COUCH. WE'RE NOT HAVING A FIGHT! WELL, THEN WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? NOW, THIS IS A FIGHT. THIS AND THAT... ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT. TAKE THAT. ( giggling ) TRUCE... TRUCE. ( coughing ) I GIVE UP. EW. OH, MY GOODNESS. ( clears throat ) PART OF ME WANTED YOU TO BE JEALOUS. OF WHO? TONY SPANO? YEAH. PRETTY SILLY, HUH? YEAH. PART OF ME REALLY WANTED TO BUY INTO ALL THIS-- YOU AND ME... HONEYMOON SUITE... CHAMPAGNE, MOONLIGHT. I MUST BE NUTS. WELL, IF YOU'RE NUTS, THEN I AM, TOO. ( knock at door ) NOT AGAIN. Bobby: HEY, COME ON, OPEN THE DOOR. IT'S ME. COMING. HI. HELLO. Bobby: WHY'S IT SO DARK IN HERE? BECAUSE IT'S NIGHT. I THINK I'LL TURN ON THE LIGHT. THERE, ISN'T THAT MUCH BETTER? ( laughs ) WHAT'S WITH ALL THE FEATHERS? WE HAD CHICKEN FOR DINNER. Bobby: REALLY? HOW WAS IT? GO AWAY. I CAN'T. WE GOT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO. WE DON'T HAVE ANY BUSINESS. YES, WE DO-- SIS... GOOD NIGHT, BOBBY. HOW LONG DO YOU NEED TO CHARM EDDIE SPAGHETTI? GOOD NIGHT, BOBBY. I THINK I'LL CRASH RIGHT HERE. NO, YOU WON'T. WHY NOT? BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE WAITER SPENT THE NIGHT HERE. GIVES NEW MEANING TO "ROOM SERVICE." SO, GO. GO! ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO. BUT IT'S A DAMN GOOD THING I GOT A ROOM RIGHT ACROSS THIS TOWER. I CAN SEE EVERYTHING. I'M GOING TO BRUSH MY TEETH. DON'T FORGET TO FLOSS. HEY. WHAT? AREN'T YOU BEING A LITTLE OVERPROTECTIVE? OH, PLEASE, RENO. YOU KNOW SHE'S CARRIED A TORCH FOR YOU SINCE YOU GUYS MET. DON'T BE RIDICULOUS. DOES SHE EVER TALK ABOUT OTHER MEN? THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. THREE DATES, TOPS. SHE COMPARES THEM TO YOU. WE HAVE A PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP. BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE IT OUR PROBLEM. AND I'LL TELL YOU SHE HAS PAID FOR IT DEARLY. SHE HAS? COME ON-- IN A PERFECT WORLD YOU TWO WOULD BE TOGETHER. YOU'RE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER. I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT. I LOVE YOU BOTH AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE EITHER ONE OF YOU HURT. THANKS.

I'M NOT SURE. WHY, WHAT'S WRONG? I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU. I'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT LOSING YOU FROM THE FIRST DAY I MET YOU. I'VE PRAYED TO GOD SO HARD THAT HE MUST BE TIRED OF HEARING FROM ME BUT HE'S ALWAYS KEPT YOU SAFE. WELL, MAYBE YOUR FAITH IS JUST A LITTLE BIT STRONGER THAN MINE. I'LL BE FINE. CHEY. I'VE BEEN THINKING. YOU AND I HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER. I KNOW IT'S NOT A PERFECT WORLD AND IT'LL NEVER BE A PERFECT WORLD BUT I WANT US TO BE TOGETHER. I WANT US... TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I WANT YOU TO BE MY WIFE. IT WOULD NEVER WORK. WHY NOT? WELL, WHERE WOULD WE GO? TONY SPANO IS LEAVING THE COUNTRY. IF THE LAW CAN'T FIND HIM, IT CAN'T FIND ME. IF WE DISAPPEAR NOW, SPANO WILL GET AWAY. BOBBY'LL GET HIM. WHAT IF HE DOESN'T? WE CAN'T WALK AWAY, RENO. I DON'T WANT ANYTHING HAPPENING TO YOU. NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WANT TO SAY "YES" RIGHT NOW, I CAN'T. I CAN'T. CAN I ASK YOU LATER? I'D LIKE THAT. Man: JUST PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT I'M SAYING.
