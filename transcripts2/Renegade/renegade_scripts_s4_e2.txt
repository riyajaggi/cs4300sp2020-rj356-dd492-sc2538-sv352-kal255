A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WE HELD THE TABLE AS LONG AS WE COULD. THANKS. I'M GOING TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE. VISITING HOURS ARE OVER, SENOR. IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO FOR YOU? YEAH. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PARTNER? AND YOU ARE... WHO? VINCE BLACK. WE WORK TOGETHER. ANOTHER BOUNTY HUNTER. ARE YOU PEOPLE HAVING SOME KIND OF A CONVENTION DOWN HERE? UH, LOOK... MR. SIXKILLER JUST CAME DOWN HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT A DAVID POMERANZ. A SUSPECT IN THE ROBBERY OF THE EMPEROR CRUISE LINE CASINO. ROBBERY? $500,000 IN CASH. YOUR FRIEND MR. POMERANZ DRILLED THE CASINO SAFE. WE'RE TRYING TO LOCATE HIM HERE IN PUERTO VALLARTA. THEN WHY DID YOU DETAIN MY PARTNER? I THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE AN ACCOMPLICE OF MR. POMERANZ. APPARENTLY... THAT IS NOT THE CASE. SO, WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET HIM GO? LOOK... MR.... BLACK-- YOU'RE A BOUNTY HUNTER. FIND ME A BOUNTY. BRING ME MR. POMERANZ AND THE MONEY HE STOLE YOUR FRIEND GOES FREE. BUT I NEED HIM TO HELP ME. YOU LOOK... CAPABLE TO ME. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE I MARRIED A CROOK. I MEAN, YES, IT WAS A WHIRLWIND... ROMANCE BUT GOD, A CON MAN! ( sighs ) MY MOTHER WARNED ME. SHE SAID IT WOULDN'T LAST THREE YEARS. IT DIDN'T EVEN LAST THREE DAYS. ( sighs ) TELL ME ABOUT THE NIGHT ON THE SHIP. WE GOT DRESSED, UM... DAVID HAD ME WEAR THIS DRESS THAT HE BOUGHT FOR ME. I WAS EMBARRASSED-- IT WAS... LOW-CUT. YOU KNOW, REVEALING. AND THEN WE WENT TO DINNER AND THEN WE WENT TO CASINO AND PLAYED SOME BLACKJACK. DAVID LOST A LITTLE MONEY, UM... AND THAT AWFUL MAN, MOE WAS HANGING AROUND. YOU GUYS TOGETHER THE WHOLE TIME? YES... NO, UH, WAIT-- HE LEFT ME TO PLAY BY MYSELF FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I LOST A LOT OF MONEY-- ALMOST $2,000. I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT BLACKJACK. HOW LONG WAS HE GONE? ABOUT 20 MINUTES. HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO TAKE SOME PICTURES OF THE MOON ON THE HORIZON. I JUST FEEL LIKE SUCH A FOOL. WAS HE UPSET ABOUT THE MONEY YOU LOST? NO, NOT AT ALL. HE WAS... OH, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. YOU THINK HE WAS USING ME AS A DISTRACTION WHILE HE ROBBED THE CASINO? OH, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT. WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THIS MAN. WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE BOAT YOU WERE IN? UM... THE MAYBELLE. OKAY, STAY HERE, LOCK THE DOOR DON'T ANSWER IT, DON'T GO OUTSIDE DON'T ORDER ROOM SERVICE, NOTHING. I UNDERSTAND. ( shotgun chambering round ) MOE, LOOKEE HERE-- IF IT ISN'T YOUR FRIEND FROM THE BAR. HE'S CLEAN. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. WE'RE EVEN. IT'S NICE TO SEE WE'RE ALL GETTING ALONG. MR. NOSY, YOU GOT TEN SECONDS TO TELL ME HOW YOU FIT IN WITH DAVID POMERANZ AND WHERE THE LITTLE LADY STASHED HERSELF. I DON'T FIT IN. I DON'T KNOW DAVID POMERANZ. I'M HERE ON VACATION, OKAY? I OFFERED TO HELP THE LADY. SHE'S INNOCENT. DAVID USED HER AS A DISTRACTION WHILE HE LEFT THE TABLE. THAT'S REAL GOOD. MAKES A LOT OF SENSE DON'T IT, MIKE? YEAH. SEE, THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM: DAVID POMERANZ NEVER LEFT THE TABLE-- SHE DID. ( sighs ) OH, NO. DON'T TELL ME FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES? EXACTLY 20 MINUTES. DID HE DROP TWO GRAND? WITHOUT FLINCHING. YOU GUYS ARE INSURED. WHY ARE YOU SO MANIC ABOUT GETTING YOUR MONEY BACK? BAD FOR BUSINESS IF WORD GETS AROUND WE CAN BE HIT. I JUST WANT TO GET MY FRIEND OUT OF JAIL. THE LADY LIED TO ME. I'LL HELP YOU FIND YOUR MONEY. LET ME GO-- SHE'LL DEAL WITH ME A LOT SOONER THAN YOU OR EINSTEIN OVER HERE. HEY... EASY. ( sighs ) DEAL. BUT IF I EVEN GET A HINT THAT YOU'RE IN ON THIS WITH THEM... I KNOW, I KNOW... I'M TOAST. ANNIE? ANNIE, YOU HERE? CHECKING OUT SO SOON? OH, I... I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. I'M GOING TO MY MOTHER'S IN SAN DIEGO. REALLY? TWO-TO-ONE YOUR MOM DOESN'T EVEN LIVE IN SAN DIEGO. VINCE! SAVE IT. YOU GOT A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO. ALL RIGHT, I WANT THE TRUTH! YOU DRILLED THE SAFE? VERY GOOD. YOU'RE A BURGLAR. "GRIFTER," PLEASE. DAVID LOSES A BUNDLE IN THE NIGHT, AND YOU SLIP OUT WITH A BLACK & DECKER IN YOUR PURSE... IT'S A BIT SIMPLISTIC, BUT BASICALLY CORRECT. YOU MUST BE REAL GOOD WITH A DRILL. I'M THE BEST OPERATOR ON THE WEST COAST. I CAN RACK A HAUS KRUEGER SAFE... IN UNDER 14 MINUTES. I'M IMPRESSED. YOU SHOULD BE. SO, WHAT WAS THE PLAN ONCE YOU GOT HERE? DAVID AND I WERE GOING TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN THIS DUMP THEN TAKE THE MAYBELLE UP THE COAST. HIS PLAN WAS TO BOOK WITH THE CASH WHEN HE CHECKED ON THE BOAT. YOU DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. ALL I KNOW IS I DON'T TRUST GRIFTERS AND I'M SURPRISED YOU LET THIS HAPPEN-- YOU BEING THE BEST AND ALL. DAVID WOULDN'T DOUBLE-CROSS ME. WHY? 'CAUSE YOU'RE SO LOVABLE? THAT'S ONE WAY OF PUTTING IT. OKAY, ONE LAST QUESTION: WHY ME? I PICKED YOU OUT IN TEN SECONDS. RENO RAINES, RIGHT? I'VE SEEN YOUR PICTURE IN THE "WANTED" STACKS. YEAH, RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR OWN. AS A MATTER OF FACT, YES. I WAS GOING TO BRIBE A LOCAL COP TO HELP ME FIND DAVID... BUT YOU FIGURED I'D DO IT FOR FREE. WAS I WRONG? OKAY, COME ON. WHERE ARE WE GOING? YOU'RE GOING TO BUY US SOME GEAR. WE'RE GOING TO BUST BOBBY OUT OF JAIL. I MUST COMMEND YOU, MR. POMERANZ-- FOR A SIMPLE CON MAN... YOU HOLD UP WELL TO PHYSICAL ABUSE. I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. THAT... IS EVIDENT... BUT... YOU DO KNOW WHERE IT'S LOCATED. YOU CAN ASK ME A HUNDRED TIMES. I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS. YOU STILL EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT YOUR LITTLE FRIEND ANNIE HAS THE MONEY? YEAH, SHE HAS THE MONEY. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. BUT THAT'S OKAY. WE HAVE ALL NIGHT. I DON'T GO ON DUTY UNTIL 8:00 A.M. ( whispering ): HONEY. HONEY, COME HERE. COME HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING..? SHH! ( snoring ) Bobby: HEY! HEY! WHAT, YOU CRAZY? GET BACK! STAND BACK-- WAY BACK. SURE? YES. GO! GO! WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON? HAVEN'T YOU EVER BEEN TO A COMING-OUT PARTY? WHY IS MOSELY SO CRAZY TO GET HIS MONEY BACK? BEING ROBBED IS BAD FOR BUSINESS. THEY HAD .45s AND SAWED-OFF SHOTGUNS? MOE MOSELY WOULD KILL ANYBODY FOR A HUNDRED BUCKS. TRUST ME. TRUST YOU? JUST AN EXPRESSION. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE CASINO HOST FOR EMPEROR CRUISE LINES IS A KILLER. IMAGINE WHAT THOSE COMMERCIALS WOULD SOUND LIKE NOW. ♪ BREAK YOUR LEGS NOW, SHOOT YOUR LEGS NOW ♪ ♪ AIN'T WE GOT FUN? ♪ HE DOESN'T WORK FOR THE CRUISE LINE. THEY SUBCONTRACT THE GAMBLING OPERATIONS. HE'S OUT OF ATLANTIC CITY. OH. THAT'S A RELIEF. HERE'S WHAT WE NEED: WE NEED GUNS, WE NEED AMMO... MARTINEZ! THE COP? ON THE PHONE LAST NIGHT HE BROKE A DATE WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. SAID HE HAD TO GO TO CASA ALLENDE WHICH IS OUT IN THE DESERT. HE'S GOT TO BE IN DEEP ON THIS THING. MOE PROBABLY HAS HIM LOOKING FOR THE DOUGH IN EXCHANGE FOR A CUT. AND ONCE HE FINDS IT, HE'S GOING TO KEEP IT. CASA ALLENDE'S OUR BEST SHOT. VINCE? ARE YOU CHECKING OUT? NO! YES. NO. YES. Bobby: TEMPORARILY. I TOLD YOU THIS WAS JUST A SCAM TO IMPRESS US. OR GET RID OF US. NIKKI, I CAN EXPLAIN LATER. IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH HER MISSING HUSBAND. WE CAN STILL HAVE OUR WEEKEND. TRUST ME? I DON'T KNOW WHY I SHOULD. ME NEITHER. COME ON, NIKKI. HAVE ANY LUCK? NADA. THAT'S GREAT. AND YOU LET THE INDIAN GET AWAY? SIXKILLER AND BLACK WILL FIND DAVID POMERANZ... SOONER THAN YOU THINK. NOW YOU WOULDN'T BE, UH, HOLDING OUT ON ME, CAPTAIN? WHATEVER WOULD PUT THAT IDEA INTO YOUR HEAD? GREED DOES THINGS TO PEOPLE. I KNOW. IT'S A PRINCIPLE BY WHICH I RUN MY BUSINESS. AND A GREEDY LITTLE BUSINESS IT IS... DUMPING DIRTY DOLLARS TO PUSH OUR PESO FURTHER INTO THE GUTTER. NOBODY PUT A GUN TO YOUR HEAD. YOU JUST FIND MY MONEY. CASA ALLENDE IS JUST A DOT ON THIS MAP. I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE PASSED IT OR NOT. WELL, MAYBE THE TACO JOCKEY MIGHT KNOW WHERE IT IS. COME ON, RENO. YOUR SPANISH IS BETTER THAN MINE. DO YOU GUYS WANT A SODA? ANYTHING'LL DO. OH! HEY! IF YOU SAY NEVER TRUST A GRIFTER I'M GOING TO PUNCH YOU RIGHT IN THE NOSE. COME ON, COME ON! THANKS. WE'LL BRING IT RIGHT BACK. I'LL GET YOU A DOCTOR, I PROMISE. I WILL GET YOU OUT OF HERE. BUT... BUT YOU HAVE TO TELL ME SOMETHING. DID YOU DOUBLE-CROSS ME? YES. YOU DIRTY S.O.B.! HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME? IT'S WHAT I DO. WHERE'S THE MONEY, DAVID? MONEY'S... NO GOOD. WHERE IS IT, DAVID? YOU DON'T... YOU DON'T WANT IT. TRUST ME. TRUST YOU. IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION. THE MONEY'LL JUST GET YOU KILLED. WHAT IS THIS? YOU'VE SEEN GOD OR SOMETHING? YOU HAVING AN AWAKENING? I'M DYING, ANNIE. I FORGIVE YOU FOR TRYING TO CHEAT ME OUT OF MY SHARE. I UNDERSTAND. I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DID BUT IT'S OVER NOW. YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST TELL ME WHERE IT IS. WHERE'S THE MONEY, DAVID? KEY. WHAT? KEY... SEVEN... ELEVEN. WHAT, YOU LEFT IT AT A CONVENIENCE STORE? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? A... BOATHOUSE. DAVID? DAVID! HERE YOU GO, COWBOY. OKAY. ( sighs ) ( sighs ) LOOKS LIKE WE'RE FIVE MINUTES TOO LATE. I DIDN'T KILL HIM. I WOULD'VE, BUT I DIDN'T. THAT'S TOUCHING. DID HE SAY WHERE THE MONEY MIGHT BE? JUST CURIOUS. AND MILDLY INTERESTED ABOUT SAVING OUR LIVES. HE MUMBLED SOMETHING ABOUT "KEY," "7-11" AND "BOATHOUSE" BUT HE WAS JUST PLAYING WITH ME. SOME BIZARRE LAST JOKE FROM THE GREAT BEYOND. AND THAT WAS IT? NO. HE SAID THE MONEY'S NO GOOD. IT MIGHT GET ME KILLED. THAT FIGURES. GOT HIM KILLED. GOOD TIME FOR HIM TO DEVELOP MORALS. MAYBE HE WANTED HIS LAST CHANCE AT REDEMPTION. YOU DIDN'T KNOW DAVID. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. ALL THIS SENTIMENT'S GETTING ME CHOKED UP. ( gunshots ) WHERE IS HE?! WHERE IS HE?! TWELVE O'CLOCK. I SAID GO! GO! AH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HEY! YOU KNOW, THERE'S JUST NO TRUST LEFT IN THIS WORLD. YEAH. SAME THOUGHT I HAD WHEN YOU DROVE AWAY FROM US IN THIS CAR. I HAD TO GET TO HIM FIRST. YOU MEAN THE MONEY FIRST. NO. I HAD TO KNOW IF DAVID DOUBLE-CROSSED ME. WELL, DID HE? YES. OH, QUEL SURPRISE, MON AMI. 7-11... I WONDER WHAT HE MEANT? IT COULD BE A LOCKER. NO AIRPORTS AROUND HERE. HE WOULDN'T GO TO A BUS STATION. HE SAID BOATHOUSE. AT THE MARINA. I SAW A BOATHOUSE AT THE MARINA. 7-11... AH, GREAT. WHAT DO WE DO NOW? GO AHEAD AND SHOOT IT. I DON'T HAVE A GUN. AMATEURS. THANK YOU, DAVID. ( screams with delight ) HALLELUJAH! DAVID, I WILL BUY YOU THAT EBONY COFFIN YOU ALWAYS WANTED. HOLD THE FUNERAL. LET ME CHECK SOMETHING. PROBLEM? ALL U.S. CURRENCY HAS A METALLIC STRIP EMBEDDED INTO IT. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. WOW. YOU MEAN THIS IS PHONY? AS CAPTAIN KIRK'S HAIR. THE MONEY'S NO GOOD. THAT'S WHAT DAVID MEANT. THAT IS CORRECT. IT IS COUNTERFEIT MONEY. BUT MORE IMPORTANT... IT'S OUR COUNTERFEIT MONEY. LET ME GUESS HERE-- YOU CLOWNS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CHAOS AND EXCHANGE RATES BY LAUNDERING FUNNY MONEY. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YOU GUYS WEREN'T EVEN STEALING REAL MONEY. IT'S STILL STEALING. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE LAST-MORAL-MAN COMMITTEE HAS SPOKEN. WHY DON'T YOU GET BACK TO THE SHIP, MIKE. DID SHE INSULT ME? GO! IS THIS WHERE YOU SAY "DRIVE THESE GUYS TO THE DESERT AND SHOOT THEM"? NO. THIS IS WHERE I GET TO DO THE JOB PERSONALLY TO MAKE SURE IT GETS DONE RIGHT. YES. THREE GREEDY CON MEN CAUGHT IN A WEB OF DECEIT AND DOUBLE CROSS. YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING WAY WITH WORDS, SENOR. SHUT UP AND GET INSIDE. SEE WHAT I MEAN? HOW DID YOU KNOW THEY'D FIND DAVID POMERANZ? BECAUSE I LET THEM FIND HIM. YOU DON'T STRIKE ME AS BEING THAT CLEVER. DON'T LET PERSONAL PREJUDICES GET IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS. OH, I'D NEVER DO THAT. YOU LET THEM GO WHEN YOU WERE SHOOTING OUT WITH THEM? I HAD TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD. UH-HUH. YOU'RE A VERY SUSPICIOUS MAN, MR. MOSELY. IT PAYS IN MY LINE OF WORK. ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS, IT'S TIME TO DEAL. I CAN HARDLY WAIT. IF I GET US OUT OF THIS WILL YOU BOY SCOUTS LET ME GO? WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THAT ONCE WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO LIVE. TA-DA. I NEED TO KNOW NOW. ARE YOU GUYS INTERESTED OR NOT? PARTNER? WHATEVER SHE COMES UP WITH WILL BE DEVIOUS AND UNDERHANDED. AH, SO IT MIGHT WORK. ALL I'M SAYING IS SHE'LL TRY, NO MATTER WHAT. OKAY. LET'S DEAL. LISTEN, GUYS WHY HAVE A TRIPLE MURDER ON YOUR CONSCIENCE? WHY DON'T WE WORK SOMETHING OUT? TOO LATE FOR THAT. A MILLION BUCKS IS A HELL OF A LOT OF MONEY TO SPLIT FIVE WAYS. A MILLION BUCKS? OKAY, THREE WAYS. WE'LL SPLIT OUR THIRD BETWEEN OURSELVES. WHAT THE HELL YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT DAVID TOOK FROM YOUR SAFE. YOU TOLD ME A HALF A MILLION. DON'T LISTEN TO HER. GUYS, GUYS, A MILLION, A HALF MILLION... WHAT DOES IT MATTER? HOW MUCH WAS IN THIS CASE? ABOUT A MILLION BUCKS... WOULDN'T YOU SAY? A HALF MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE SLIDING ALL OVER INSIDE THAT CASE. A MILLION, IT'S FILLED RIGHT TO THE BRIM. HEY, HEY... CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING? WHAT DID YOU TELL ME ABOUT BEING GREEDY? IT CAN MAKE A MAN CRAZY... LIKE YOU'RE ACTING NOW. YOU'RE HOLDING OUT ON ME. YOU'VE TRIED TO SCORE THE MONEY FOR YOURSELF SINCE THE START. YOU CALLING ME A THIEF? NO... YOU'RE CALLING ME A CHISELER. ( groans ) YES! OOH... LADY, YOU ARE ONE PIECE OF WORK. OH, I HAPPEN TO BE AN EXPERT IN THE AREA OF HUMAN NATURE. I DON'T KNOW IF THESE TWO QUALIFY AS BEING HUMAN. I'M JUST GLAD, YOU KNOW, IT ALL WORKED OUT OKAY. AH, AH, AH, AH... WE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT TURNING OVER THE MONEY. OH, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPLIED. DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE MONEY? IT'S COUNTERFEIT. NO. IT'LL STILL GET YOU KILLED. HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED ANYTHING? YES. NOT TO TRUST A BOUNTY HUNTER AND A CONVICTED FELON. ( laughing ) AH, MAGNIFICO. ALMOST AS NICE AS THE COMPANY. OH, I THINK I LIKE MINE BETTER OVER MESQUITE. ANNIE POMERANZ. NIKKI MANTLE. CHARMED. WHO ARE YOU WILLIE MAYS? AW, BE NICE. WHERE'S MY MONEY? YOUR MONEY? OH, NO. YOU DIDN'T. YOU WOULDN'T. DID WE, LADIES? YEAH. WE SURE DID. WHAT A RUSH. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS. I HAVE THE LAST BUNDLE... RIGHT HERE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THE HONORS? THANK YOU, SIR. ( chuckling ) YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS? YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME. YOU DON'T HAVE AN OPEN MIND. MM. HOLD ON TO YOUR WALLET, FRIEND. IF YOU WOULD JUST OPEN YOUR MINDS TO SOME NEW IDEAS. I THINK THE THREE OF US MADE A REALLY GOOD TEAM. I SEE ALL KINDS OF POSSIBILITIES HERE. NO, YOU SEE... WE'RE NOT CRIMINALS. WE CATCH CRIMINALS. THAT'S EXACTLY THE ATTITUDE I'M TALKING ABOUT. I MEAN, HALF THE WORLD THINKS YOU'RE A CRIMINAL ANYWAY. WHOA, WHOA, ANNIE, ANNIE... TAKE THE LOAD OFF, OKAY? HAVE A WIENIE. OKAY. WE'LL TALK AFTER DINNER. I HAVE PLENTY OF TIME.
