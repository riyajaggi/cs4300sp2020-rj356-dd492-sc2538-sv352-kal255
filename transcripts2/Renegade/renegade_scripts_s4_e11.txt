 Renegade (1992â€“1997): Season 4, Episode 11 - Sins of the Father - full transcript 
 Dutch Dixon's son Donnie gets out of prison. He decides that he will sell his father up the river for the right price. Although he contacts Sixkiller first, he cuts a more profitable deal with a former police officer that Dutch screwed over to get ahead. Even after all of this, Reno still insists on being involved, feeling that he can't pass up the opportunity to bring down Dixon. In a strange twist of fate he finds himself saving Dutch Dixon rather than persecuting him.

 HOW MANY CONS LEARN THEIR LESSON IN PRISON? GOD ONLY KNOWS WHO OR WHAT'S COMING OUT TOMORROW. WE FAILED WITH THAT BOY. I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW BAD WE SCREWED HIM UP. ( sighs ) I REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS BORN, THINKING HE WAS GOING TO BE SOMETHING SPECIAL. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT HE AND I, WELL, WE'D... WOULD YOU TURN OUT THE LIGHT, PLEASE? THOUGHT HE'D BE A FOOTBALL PLAYER OR A BASEBALL PLAYER. I'D GO TO HIS GAMES AND WATCH HIM PLAY. YOU NEVER WATCHED HIM DO ANYTHING. YOU WERE ALWAYS TOO DAMN BUSY.

I WAS OUT TRYING TO MAKE A PLACE FOR US. TURN OUT THE LIGHT. JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T MAKE A PLAY AND A COUPLE OF SCHOOL EVENTS THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DIDN'T LOVE HIM. YOU CAN'T IGNORE A KID AND THEN WHEN HE SETS FIRE TO YOUR CLOTHES START GIVING HIM EVERYTHING JUST SO HE WON'T DO IT AGAIN. HE'S GOT NO VALUES. HE DIDN'T SET FIRE TO MY CLOTHES, OKAY? THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT. HE AND SOME FRIENDS WERE SMOKING IN THE POOL HOUSE AND THE CLEANER'S CELLOPHANE BAGS CAUGHT FIRE. TURN OUT THE LIGHT. OH, AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO DOWNSTAIRS AND PLAY THOSE DAMN VIDEOS ALL NIGHT LONG AGAIN WOULD YOU KEEP THE VOLUME DOWN? THE SOUND COMES RIGHT UP THROUGH THE FLOOR. ( chuckling ): DONNY...

IT'S OVER. WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE? LOOK, I CHANGED MY MIND. I'M NOT GOING TO TURN MY DAD OVER TO SOME GUY WEARING THOSE EARRINGS. ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT WEREN'T YOU GOING TO TELL ME? I OFFERED DONNY DIXON $100,000 FOR INFORMATION TO PUT HIS DAD AWAY IN PRISON-- $200,000 FOR INFORMATION THAT WOULD CLEAR YOUR NAME. YOU CAN'T DO THAT, BOBBY. I DON'T WANT YOU COMMITTING CRIMES OR SPENDING THAT KIND OF MONEY. I'M NOT COMMITTING ANY CRIMES. I MADE AN OFFER TO BUY SOME INFORMATION FROM A SOURCE-- THAT'S ALL. YOU WERE SETTING UP AN ILLEGAL SEARCH ASSISTING A FELON. DONNY LEFT IN A LIMO. OFF THE LICENSE PLATE, I GOT AN ADDRESS. THE VEHICLE IS REGISTERED TO A LOCAL ROCK CLUB CALLED CHINA WHITE. I LOVE THAT. YEAH, ME TOO. SO WHAT'S LITTLE DONNY DIXON DOING GETTING PICKED UP OUT OF PRISON IN A WHITE LIMOUSINE THAT'S OWNED BY A ROCK CLUB NAMED AFTER ASIAN HEROIN? I DON'T KNOW. THE KID'S A WRONG NUMBER. A WRONG NUMBER THAT WAS WILLING TO SELL ME HIS FATHER YESTERDAY AND TODAY, HE'S NOT-- WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? HE'S GOT A BETTER BUYER. EXACTLY. MAYBE I NEED TO FIND OUT WHO. ( laughter ) EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING FOR WORK AS A BARTENDER. YOU GUYS WOULDN'T HAVE AN APPLICATION, WOULD YOU? DON'T EVEN BOTHER, JOE-BOB. WE GOT 200 APS IN THE DRAWER ALREADY. UM... TRY THE MARKET. THEY GOT A SIGN UP LOOKING FOR BAG BOYS AND... YOU'D BE PERFECT FOR THAT. I'M JUST LOOKING FOR A JOB, FRIEND. YOU NEED TO WORK ON GETTING A LITTLE FRIENDLIER ATTITUDE. WHY'S THAT? 'CAUSE YOU'RE TALKING TO A PILE OF TROUBLE. YOU'RE SCARING ME TO DEATH, TARZAN... AND WE DON'T NEED A BOUNCER, EITHER IF THAT'S WHERE THIS IS LEADING, SO BEAT IT OR YOU'LL GET A LITTLE NINE-MILLIMETER HELP. I'LL CHECK YOU LATER. ( raspberry ) ( all laughing ) These guys had enough prison art tattooed on their arms TO QUALIFY FOR AN N.E.A. GRANT. It sounds like you and I better FIND OUT WHO OWNS THIS CLUB. THE LIQUOR LICENSE ABOVE THE BAR WAS MADE OUT TO A MAN NAMED ROBERT McKENNA. I'LL LOOK IT UP. Listen, I need you here tonight when the place opens. YOU KNOW THE DRILL-- DRESS FOR STRESS. Donny: THANKS, BUD. KEEP THE CHANGE. HELLO..? ANYBODY HOME? ( playing "Onward Christian Soldiers" on piano) MOM... DAD, HI. HI. DON, I... SHE WAS-- WE WERE... I WOULD HAVE... IF YOU WERE GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT MEETING ME AT THE PRISON GATE, DON'T. IT WAS BAD ENOUGH I WAS IN THERE TO BEGIN WITH. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WATCH ME GET OUT. I CAN IMAGINE HOW HUMILIATING THAT MUST BE. WELL, WE WERE GOING TO COME, DON. IT'S JUST THAT... YOUR FATHER HAD A COURT APPEARANCE AND I HAD TO SHOW A HOUSE IN SUMMERHILL. LISTEN, YOU GUYS... IT'S OKAY. I'M NEVER ALONE. I HAVE MY SAVIOR WITH ME ALL THE TIME. WHO? JESUS. JESUS WALKS WITH ME EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY. I FOUND HIM IN PRISON AND YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW HE COMFORTS ME... HOW HE MAKES ME WHOLE. OKAY, YEAH... "I WILL NOT SUFFER THE ANGER OF THE LORD NOR WILL I FOLLOW A MULTITUDE TO DO EVIL." EXODUS 23:2. ( chuckling ): OH... EXODUS. I KNOW HOW MUCH PAIN AND HOW MUCH ANGUISH I HAVE CAUSED YOU, AND I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE THAT RIGHT. I HAVE DECIDED THAT I AM GOING TO BE THE SON THAT YOU WANT ME TO BE. I KNOW I DON'T DESERVE THIS BUT, MOM, DAD... ( voice cracking ): COULD I... COULD I GIVE EACH OF YOU A HUG? I KNOW, I KNOW-- IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT?

I MEAN, THAT'S WHY I WENT TO BEGIN WITH. I WAS GOING TO DO THIS WHOLE JESUS DANCE FOR THE PAROLE BOARD, BUT WHEN I GOT THERE, I FOUND SUCH... STRENGTH? THAT'S WHAT I GOT WHEN I WENT TO CHURCH. THAT'S IT EXACTLY, MOM: STRENGTH. DON'T YOU THINK, DAD? UH... YEAH. COULD BE... MAYBE, YOU KNOW. LISTEN, UH, WHEN I WAS WALKING UP I NOTICED THAT THE HEDGE COULD USE A LITTLE TRIMMING. DO YOU MIND IF I GOT THE SHEARS AND CUT IT BACK A LITTLE? I THINK IT'LL LOOK BETTER. LOOK, DON, I HAVE A MEETING WITH SOME FIELD U.C.s AND I CAN'T HELP... OH, THAT'S OKAY. I AM SORT OF HOPING, THOUGH THAT YOU'LL LET ME HAVE MY OLD ROOM BACK. I WON'T ASK TO BORROW THE CAR OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANYTHING. I'LL GET A JOB. I'LL PITCH IN FOR THE GROCERIES. WELL, DON, WE TURNED YOUR ROOM INTO AN UPSTAIRS STUDY, AND... WELL, WE CLEARED OUT YOUR THINGS. THAT'S OKAY. "WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I SPOKE AS A CHILD. BUT NOW THAT I AM A MAN, I PUT AWAY CHILDISH THINGS." CORINTHIANS. I'LL JUST GO PUT MY BAG DOWN. EXCUSE ME. HAPPY SON OF A BITCH. GET OUT OF THE CAR! COME ON! GET YOUR BUTT OVER HERE WHERE I CAN...

I'M HAVING THIS LITTLE PARTY AT MY HOUSE-- A POOL PARTY-- TOMORROW, STARTS ABOUT 2:00. I'LL BE THERE, SIR. YEAH. THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO CHURCH. I JUST WANTED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS FIRST. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE IT TOO FAR BACK BECAUSE... WELL, IT'S PAST SPRING AND I DIDN'T WANT IT TO LOOK ALL BROWN AND STICKY FOR A WHOLE MONTH. WHAT'S GOING ON, DON? I JUST WANT TO MAKE THINGS UP TO YOU AND MOM. YOU'RE NOT SEEING THIS JESUS THING A HUNDRED TIMES. GUY GOES TO PRISON. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, HE'S SLEEPING WITH THE BIBLE HE'S QUOTING SCRIPTURES IT'S ALWAYS JUST A SHOW FOR THE PAROLE BOARD. BUT I MADE PAROLE, DAD. PAROLE BOARD LET ME GO. AND YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE THEY COULD SEE BEHIND THE CURTAIN TO MY FAITH. WHY ELSE WOULD I DO THIS UNLESS I WAS SINCERE? WHAT WOULD I HAVE TO GAIN? YOU KNOW, UH... IF YOU TRIM THIS BACK HERE, DONNY YOU'LL MAINTAIN THE HEDGE LINE. OH, RIGHT YOU ARE, DAD. I'LL GET THAT RIGHT AFTER CHURCH. IF YOU WANT TO BORROW THE CAR YOU KNOW, MOM AND I AREN'T USING IT ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS ASK. OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I'M GOING TO TAKE THE BUS. I DO NOT WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. I DID THAT THE WHOLE FIRST HALF OF MY LIFE, AND THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. ( laughs ) I REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE FIRST BORN. JUST A COUPLE HOURS OLD, MATERNITY WARD LOOKING AT YOU THROUGH THE GLASS. YOU LOOKED UP AT ME. FOR A MINUTE THERE, OUR EYES LOCKED. WE CONNECTED. REALLY? YOU LOOKED AT ME AND... YOU KNEW I WAS YOUR DAD. BOY, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN NEAT, I BET. I HAD... JUST BIG PLANS FOR US, YOU KNOW. I-I-I UNDERSTAND. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU HAD BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN PLAY BALL IN YOUR BACKYARD WITH YOUR OWN KID. YOU KNOW, DON, I WANT YOU TO KNOW I VIEW THAT AS MY FAULT. I NEVER INVESTED THE TIME WITH YOU I SHOULD HAVE AND I HAD SO MUCH GOING ON YOU KNOW, MY CAREER AND EVERYTHING. I'M SORRY, DON. APOLOGY ACCEPTED. WELL, UH, YOU KNOW, I GOT TO GO. I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE FOR CHURCH. WHAT A... DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THAT PARTY. BECAUSE IF DONNY'S THERE AND HE SPOTS YOU YOU'VE BEEN MADE. THAT'S NOT THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IF DONNY AND McKENNA ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO TAKE DUTCH DOWN YOU COULD GET CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OR DID YOU FORGET? I AM ALREADY CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OR DID YOU FORGET? NO, I DIDN'T FORGET. I'M GOING. I'M GOING TO BACK YOU UP. YOU WANT ME TO STAY LOW? IF DONNY SPOTS YOU, IT'S AS BLOWN AS IF HE SPOTS ME. WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO ABOUT ANYTHING? WHERE YOU GOING? I'M GOING TO BE THERE. MAN, I HATE WHEN HE DOES THINGS LIKE THAT. HEY, MARK. WHY DON'T YOU JUST PARK IT SOMEWHERE DOWN THE STREET AND WIPE IT DOWN. IT'S HOT. I STOLE IT ON FILLMORE ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. HI. I LOVE YOU. GET A BEER, PLEASE. MAKING ANY PROGRESS AT HOME? AH... YOU START QUOTING FROM THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LOWER THE TESTOSTERONE LEVEL AROUND HERE. IT'S MY CHILDHOOD BIBLE. "LET NOT THY LEFT HAND KNOW WHAT THY RIGHT HAND DOETH." MATTHEW 6:3. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT'S ONE PLACE I KNOW MY DAD'LL NEVER LOOK. GOT SOME INTERESTING SKUNK HERE, BOB. YOU'VE ALSO GOT A FEW PEOPLE YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET RID OF. YEAH, WHO'S THAT? THAT GUY OVER THERE WITH THE LONG HAIR-- THE BABE MAGNET. HE'S VINCE BLACK. NO, THAT IS SO NOT VINCE BLACK. HIS NAME IS RENO RAINES. HE'S WANTED FOR MURDER. YOU INVITE HOT FELONS TO YOUR PARTY YOU COULD GET PUT AWAY FOR HARBOURING. YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? OH, I DON'T MAKE THOSE KIND OF MISTAKES. ( exhales loudly ) TAKES MORE THAN FIVE MONTHS TO DO THIS. HI. WITHOUT MAKING PROBLEMS, LET'S GO. INSIDE. SIT DOWN. OH, I TOLD YOU WE DIDN'T NEED ANY BARTENDERS. YOU SHOULD HAVE LISTENED. WELL, LOOKEE HERE. IT'S MY DAD'S OLD NEMESIS, RENO RAINES-- FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE. WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU THIS MUCH. YOU GOT QUITE A SET ON YOU, HOSS. RENO RAINES. SO, EITHER YOUR STORY IS VERY, VERY GOOD OR YOU'RE ON THE BIG BUS. COME ON, McKENNA YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KILL ME. YEAH? WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE YOU AND ME AND LITTLE DONNY OVER THERE WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING. YOUR PROBLEMS DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH US. RAINES IS WANTED FOR KILLING A COP NAMED BUZZY BURRELL. I DIDN'T KILL HIM, DONNY. YOUR OLD MAN DID AND FRAMED ME FOR IT. I GUESS WE'VE ALL GOT PROBLEMS WITH POPS. YOURS JUST DON'T INTEREST ME. BUT, DONNY, MAYBE THEY INTEREST ME. LET HIM FINISH. SIXKILLER CAME TO YOU IN JAIL OFFERED YOU $100,000 FOR EVIDENCE ON DUTCH. 200 IF YOU FOUND ANYTHING THAT COULD CLEAR ME. YEAH, AND THEN I GOT A BETTER DEAL FROM BAD BOB HERE. YEAH, BUT WE ALL WANT THE SAME THING. McKENNA WANTS DUTCH FOR TURNING HIM IN I WANT DUTCH FOR FRAMING ME FOR MURDER AND LITTLE DONNY WANTS HIM FOR... I DON'T KNOW-- SENDING HIM TO BED WITHOUT SUPPER OR SOME DAMN THING. HE'S THE BIGGEST HYPOCRITE. WE ALL WANT DUTCH. SO LET'S WORK TOGETHER. EXCEPT I DON'T NEED YOU TO GET DIXON. ALL YOU ARE TO ME IS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM THAT COULD GET ME ARRESTED FOR JUST HANGING AROUND YOU. LOOK, HE WANTS ME AS BAD AS I WANT HIM. YOU CAN USE THAT. MAKE ME THE BAIT. I'LL BE THE BUTTON YOU PUSH TO GET DIXON WHEREVER YOU WANT HIM. YOU MAKE A DEAL WITH HIM, YOU'LL END UP CHOKING ON IT. I'LL PUT THE $200,000 BACK ON THE TABLE. YOU BRING SIXKILLER INTO IT, WE'RE HISTORY. SIXKILLER PLAYS BY HIS OWN RULES. SIXKILLER'S OUT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET 200 GRAND? HEY, I'M WANTED FOR KILLING TWO PEOPLE. THERE'S A $200,000 REWARD FOR MY APPREHENSION. WE NAIL DIXON, GET THE EVIDENCE THAT CLEARS ME YOU GUYS GIVE THAT TO SIXKILLER. THEN YOU TURN ME INTO THE COPS, COLLECT THE REWARD. SIXKILLER SHOWS UP CLEARS ME WITH THE EVIDENCE. EVERYBODY'S HAPPY. ( laughing ) THAT'S NOT BAD. I DON'T TRUST HIM. I GOT A NEWS FLASH. YOU KNOW, I DON'T TRUST YOU EITHER, DONNY. BUT HATING DUTCH IS THE GLUE THAT'S GOING TO HOLD US TOGETHER. YOU'RE IN, RAINES. AH, A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU, MR. DIXON. MADAME DIXON IS ON THE TERRACE. THANK YOU, MAURICE. MEET OUR SON, DONNY. NICE TO SEE YOU, YOUNG MR. DIXON. JESUS LOVES YOU, MAURICE. GOD BLESS AND KEEP YOU. THANK YOU. HI, MOM. HI, SWEETHEART. OH, YOU LOOK SO NICE. THANK YOU. I'LL HAVE THE CHENIN BLANC. THANK YOU. WHEN MAURICE GETS HOME DOES HIS WIFE CALLS HIM MORRIS? WELL, ACTUALLY, DON HE'S FROM THE LOIRE VALLEY IN FRANCE. HIS PARENTS WERE VINTNERS. HE'S QUITE A REMARKABLE PERSON. OH. SORRY. GOT IT. This is really.. really quite a place, quite a club very exclusive. YOU KNOW, THIS WIRE WORKS GREAT. ...BUT I AM THINKING OF STARTING A BUSINESS. SO, WHO KNOWS? MAYBE SOMEDAY I'LL BE ABLE TO JOIN A PLACE LIKE THIS. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU, MAURICE. WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS? OH, I DON'T KNOW. I WAS THINKING MAYBE RELIGIOUS APPAREL OR RELIGIOUS BOOKS. WHAT KIND OF A DISTRIBUTION OR A MARKUP CAN YOU GET ON THAT? DAD, THE IDEA ISN'T TO MAKE SCADS OF MONEY. THE IDEA IS TO PUT RELIGIOUS MATERIALS INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING GOD'S WORD AND WHO OTHERWISE CAN'T AFFORD IT. DIDN'T THE BIBLE SAY "GOD HELPS THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES"? NO. THAT'S A FOLK SAYING, DAD. IT'S NOT SCRIPTURE. WELL, LIKE, YOU COULD SELL BIBLES OR SOMETHING. THAT'S HARDLY WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT, MELISSA. THE BIBLE IS THE BIGGEST-SELLING BOOK EVER. BIGGER EVEN THAN BRIDGES. I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN A CONCEPT TO DONNY, HERE. DO YOU MIND? IT'S OKAY, MOM. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEANT. THE BIBLE HAS SOLD MILLIONS OF COPIES. THAT'S WHY I WAS GIVING IT AS AN EXAMPLE OF A RELIGIOUS PRODUCT. DON'T YOU HAVE TO GO FIX YOUR MAKEUP OR SOMETHING? NO, I DON'T, AND YOU GET THAT SNIPPY TONE OUT OF YOUR VOICE, MISTER. QUITE A COUPLE. WHEN YOU'RE BEGINNING IN BUSINESS, YOU EXPLORE ALL YOUR OPTIONS. YOU MAKE A PLAN, AND YOU INVEST BIG. WELL, DAD, I DON'T HAVE ANY OPTIONS. I CAN'T INVEST BIG. I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY AT ALL. MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU ON THAT. HOW CAN YOU DO THAT? YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO START A BUSINESS. SAYS WHO? YOU'RE A FEDERAL MARSHALL. THAT'S A WONDERFUL POSITION BUT YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY MAKE THAT MUCH MONEY. YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO YOUR SURROUNDINGS HERE. YOU DON'T JOIN A CLUB LIKE THIS WITH JUST LINT IN YOUR POCKETS. IT'S TIME FOR YOU AND ME TO HAVE MY KIND OF COME-TO-JESUS MEETING. WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, DONALD? I THINK IT'S TIME FOR DONNY TO FINALLY MEET HIS FATHER. Reno: OLD DUTCH IS DOING PRETTY WELL-- PRIVATE CLUBS, EXPENSIVE CARS. HE SURE GOT DEALT A DEUCE WITH DONNY. LET'S JUST HOPE THE LITTLE CREEP CAN, UH, GET US TO THE FRUIT JAR FULL OF EVIDENCE. IF I'M GOING TO INVEST IN YOUR ENTERPRISE, I WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE WAY IT'S RUN. MONEY TALKS, RIGHT, DAD? RIGHT. Reno: ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. Donny: DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH CASH TO FLOAT THIS DEAL ON YOUR OWN, DAD? TRUST ME. I can handle it. ( static ) DAMN. THE MIC IS BEING COVERED. HOW MANY STAKEOUTS YOU BEEN ON? I WAS A BEAT COP. BUSTED HEADS WITH AN L-STICK. NEVER BEEN ON A STAKEOUT. THAT'S NOT THE SOUND OF A MIC BEING COVERED. IT'S THE SOUND OF A TRANSMITTER BEING PULLED. WHAT THE HELL'S THAT LITTLE PISSER UP TO? THANK YOU, HARRY. SON OF A GUN. THERE'S GOT TO BE AT LEAST A HUNDRED GRAND IN THERE. MORE THAN THAT, SON, A LOT MORE. HEY, WHERE'S WIDE LOAD. HE'S OUT CHECKING ON ONE OF HIS OTHER PITS. YOUR MIC WENT OUT. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET US OUTSIDE AT THE BANK. OH, YEAH. IT GOT UNPLUGGED ACCIDENTLY. I DIDN'T NOTICE IT AND THEN DAD WANTED TO SCHMOOZE. WHAT A MUD DUCK HE'S BECOME, HUH? HIS FANCY FRIENDS, AND HIS RICHY CLUB. HE TOOK ME HOME AND HE WANTED TO SIGN A CONTRACT BETWEEN US. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? MY FEELINGS WERE HURT. YOU LEADING UP TO TELLING ME SOMETHING? I'M NOT YOUR FAVORITE PERSON, AM I? WHAT WAS IN THE BOX? I WANT TO CUT A SEPARATE DEAL WITH YOU, OKAY? COME ON, MAN. WHAT ARE YOU PULLING NOW? LOOK, I'M GOING TO LEVEL WITH YOU. THERE WAS SOME CASH INSIDE THAT BOX ALONG WITH THE PAPERS. IT WASN'T A LOT, BUT IT WAS ENOUGH AND I'D JUST AS SOON WIDE LOAD DIDN'T GET HIS HANDS ON ANY OF IT. YOU GUYS JUST WANT TO SEE MY DAD PUT AWAY BUT I'VE LISTENED TO THAT DIAL TONE SINCE BIRTH AND I'D LIKE A LITTLE OF HIS SPENDING MONEY. WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS? WHY NOT OFFER THE DEAL TO McKENNA? HELLO. HE'S TOILET-BOWL DIRT. I DON'T TRUST HIM, BUT YOU'RE DIFFERENT. YOU GOT THIS CRUSADER IMAGE TO PROTECT. YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD, I'LL TAKE IT. OKAY. WHERE DOES DUTCH HIDE THE KEY? HE KEEPS IT IN HIS BADGE CASE. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO BE THE BAIT. WE LURE HIM TO SOME REMOTE PLACE, JUMP HIM GET THAT KEY, AND WE GO TO THE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX AND GET THE CASH AND THE EVIDENCE. WHAT IS McKENNA DOING? STANDING AROUND WATCHING US GO? NO, NO. I'LL TAKE McKENNA OUT OF THE PLAY. ONCE MY DAD GETS ARRESTED, McKENNA WILL CALM DOWN. THAT'S ALL HE'S BEEN DREAMING ABOUT. HOW COME THIS ALL FEELS LIKE A RAIN-SOAKED HIGHWAY TO ME? LOOK, I SAW INSIDE THAT SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX. THERE ARE ENOUGH BANK BOOKS AND ILLEGAL CHECKING ACCOUNTS TO PUT MY DAD AWAY FOREVER. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE ON YOUR CASE BUT WHAT IS IN THERE IS GOING TO MAKE HIS WORD LOOK LIKE NOTHING. SO, IF HE'S A CONVICTED LIAR AND A THIEF THAT MAKES YOUR STORY SOUND MORE LIKE THE TRUTH. OKAY, BUT I PICK THE PLACE. THERE'S AN OLD ABANDONED CHURCH DOWN ON MARKET. I USED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE CONGREGATION. IT'S DESERTED. NOBODY CAN GET IN OUR WAY. YOU TELL DUTCH THAT'S WHERE I'M HIDING OUT. CHURCH... WHO GOES TO CHURCH ANYMORE? PEOPLE OF FAITH, DONNY. I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T LEARN THAT IN BIBLE CLASS. DID HE GO FOR IT? WELL, NOT COMPLETELY. HE WANTED TO PICK THE PLACE. WELL, WE'LL CHECK IT OUT. IF IT'S OKAY, WE'LL BRING DUTCH TO THE PARTY. WHEN WE'RE FINISHED... ...NOBODY WILL BE LEFT STANDING. ( phone dialing ) Yeah. DONNY. OKAY, I'M IN. MAKE THE CALL TO YOUR DAD AND COVER MY BACK. ( alarm chirps on ) ( shotgun cocking ) OVER HERE. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. WANT TO BET? IT'S TIME FOR THIS TO FINALLY BE OVER. EITHER DROP IT OR USE IT. I'M TIRED OF YOU, RAINES. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. WE COULD END THIS WITH BUCKSHOT BUT NEITHER ONE OF US WOULD WIN. I THINK I WIN. YOU CAN'T SHOOT ME WITHOUT... RUINING YOUR CHANCE OF PROVING I'M GUILTY. WIDE LOAD McKENNA AND YOUR SON SET YOU UP. THAT'S RIGHT. THEY WANT YOU DEAD OR IN JAIL. NOW, McKENNA MAYBE. BUT NOT DONNY. DONNY AND I, WE'RE COMING TOGETHER. THAT'S LONG GONE, YOU AND YOUR SON. HE'S HERE. HE'S PACKING. HE WANTS THAT KEY TO THE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX. HE WANTS TO SEE THAT CASH. NO, DONNY AND I, WE GOT PLANS. Donny: HI, DAD. TURN AROUND AND LIE FACEDOWN ON THE FLOOR. DONNY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU'RE A SKUNK, AREN'T YOU, RAINES? YOU TIPPED HIM-- THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL. YOU HEARD THE KID, DUTCH. ON THE FLOOR-- YOU, TOO RENO. DON, WHAT IS THIS? WHAT'S GOING ON? IT'S LIKE COCKROACHES, DUTCH. EVERY GENERATION GETS DIRTIER AND UGLIER. JUST LIE DOWN OR I'LL DROP YOU LIKE A BAD HABIT. TWO AGAINST THREE, DUTCH. LOOKS LIKE THE ONLY CHANCE IS TOGETHER. YOU'RE NUTS-- I'M NOT TEAMING WITH YOU. NOW! FOR, GOD'S SAKES, DONNY, I'M YOUR FATHER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! GO AHEAD, DUTCH! I'LL COVER YOU! DAMN. HOW COULD HE DO THAT? LOOK, THE ONLY WAY TO GET OUT OF THIS THING IS TOGETHER. YEAH, YOU NEED ME ALIVE TO SAVE YOUR SKIN BUT IT PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO COME OUT THAT WAY. WE'LL DO THE BEST WE CAN. LET'S GO! THERE'S AN EXIT DOWN HERE SOMEWHERE. STICK WITH ME. HOW COULD HE DO IT? HOW COULD HE DO IT? SHUT UP! Donny: THEY'RE DOWN HERE. FOLLOW ME. ( groaning ) OH, GOD. I THINK I HIT DONNY. DUTCH! ( groaning ) SON. YOU TRIED TO KILL ME. I'M YOUR FATHER. WELL, I DESPISE YOU. ( groaning ) ( crying out in pain ) ( sirens wailing ) GO AHEAD. MAKE YOUR MOVE. GET OUT OF HERE. YOU GOT 20 MINUTES... THEN ALL BETS ARE OFF. SCOUT'S HONOR, DUTCH? MAYBE I CAN'T FINISH IT NOW. YOU SAVED MY LIFE. GO. I WANT THE KEY TO THAT SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX. THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE BUT MONEY. GET OUT OF HERE. GO! OH, GOD THIS HURTS. IT'S KILLING ME. STOP WHINING-- DO THIS WITH SOME STYLE. HEY, WHY'D YOU LET HIM GO, TOUGH GUY? YOU LET HIM GO. YOU COULD HAVE WHACKED HIM. YOU COULD HAVE WON. I WOULD HAVE LOST. IT WAS EMPTY. ( laughing ) Bobby: WE COULD GET THE STATE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO GIVE US A SEARCH WARRANT ON THAT SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX. BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THERE WORTH ANYTHING YOU CAN BET DUTCHY BOY DIXON WOULD HAVE CLEANED IT OUT BY THEN. LET'S JUST SAY BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME. I MEAN, McKENNA'S GONE. DONNY'S GOING TO GO UP FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER. SO, UH, CHEER UP. I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT THAT. I... I WAS THINKING ABOUT DUTCH. THE GUY SPENDS ALL HIS TIME... TRYING TO GET MONEY. HE STEALS IT, CHEATS FOR IT, SO HE CAN BUY HIS CARS AND... CLUBS AND ALL THE STUFF HE LIKES. BUT THEN HE'S GOT A KID LIKE DONNY. I MEAN, HE UNDOUBTEDLY RUINED THAT KID BUT THE KID POISONS EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES. YOU GOT IT. IT WAS FUNNY IN THERE-- IN THE CHURCH-- LIKE SOMETHING HAD CHANGED LIKE A PENNY DROPPED FOR DIXON LIKE HE REALIZED THAT ALL THAT HE HAD DONE WASN'T WORTH WHAT HE GOT FOR IT. HIS KID'S IN JAIL FOR TRYING TO KILL HIM. WONDER WHAT HE'S THINKING NOW. ( phone ringing ) ( ringing ) ( Dutch on answering machine): This is the Dixon residence. Leave a message after the tone. ( beep ) Melissa: Don, I have to show a house on Riverside. So Carl and I are going to go out there together. There's leftovers in the refrigerator. Don't wait up. I'll be late.
