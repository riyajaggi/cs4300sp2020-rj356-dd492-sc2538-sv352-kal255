"LIEUTENANT DIXON "JOINS THE U.S. MARSHAL'S OFFICE "TO HEAD UP THE WESTERN ARM OF THE NEW C.A.L. TASK FORCE." WHAT'S THE C.A.L.? CRIMINALS AT LARGE. NOW HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WASTE HIS TIME ON RAPISTS AND KILLERS. HE CAN CONCENTRATE ON YOU. WITH A BUNCH OF FEDERAL HELP. AND NO STATE LINES IN THE WAY. THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

IT ALWAYS SOUNDS LIKE THIS. COME ON, WE'LL TAKE MY BIKE. DON'T WORRY, I WON'T KIDNAP YOU. LOOK, I UNDERSTAND FAMILY LOYALTY. I HAVE NO LOYALTY TO HIM. ESTEBAN IS A PIG. THEN WHY DO YOU PUT UP WITH HIM? HIS FATHER-- MY UNCLE-- IS THE AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON. WHY DID YOU LEAVE THE POLICE FORCE? TOO FRUSTRATING. YOU SIGN ON TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THE SYSTEM WON'T LET YOU. IT'S STILL THE BEST SYSTEM. SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE PATRIOT EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT AMERICAN. YOUR CYNICISM IS EASY. FAITH TAKES HARD WORK. YOU OUGHT TO KNOW. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? WELL, HERE YOU ARE TRYING TO SWEEP ME OFF MY FEET HOPING I'LL IMPLICATE MY COUSIN AND THERE'S NOTHING IN IT FOR YOU. I'M NO HERO. I DO THIS BECAUSE I'M ANGRY. GOOD LAWS GET TWISTED IN IMPOSSIBLE WAYS. THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED, RULES OF EVIDENCE-- IT'S ALL MEANT TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT BUT ALL IT SEEMS TO DO IS SHELTER THE GUILTY. IT'S A MIRACLE ANYONE EVER GETS CONVICTED. A MIRACLE. LOOK ESTEBAN WAS WITH A CONVICTED COCAINE DEALER. THEY HAD A SUITCASE FULL OF CASH WHICH HAS SINCE DISAPPEARED. IT'S YOUR WORD AGAINST HIS. DO YOU THINK I'M LYING? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? HELP ME. HELP ME CATCH HIM. ALL RIGHT. THIS HAS BEEN VERY ENLIGHTENING. I, UH, THOUGHT ALL BIKERS WERE ROUGH AND SCARY.

LOOK, IT'S THE NEW CLEANING CREW. HI, KIDS. SORRY WE'RE HERE SO LATE, BUT, UH I DIDN'T WANT TO DROP BY DURING BUSINESS HOURS. THIS WOULD BE A LITTLE DISRUPTIVE. WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE'LL ONLY BE HERE LONG ENOUGH TO FIND RECORDS OF YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH RENO. YEAH, WELL, HE KEEPS GIVING US THE SLIP. THAT'S VERY FUNNY. I WONDER IF IT'LL GET A BIG LAUGH IN COURT? COME ON, BOBBY.

I'M NOT LIKE ANY COP YOU EVER MET BEFORE. NOW DRIVE. DRIVE... WHERE? TO THE STASH, KNUCKLEHEAD. WHERE DO YOU THINK? IT ISN'T IN THE COUNTRY YET. I SWEAR. I TAKE PAYMENT FIRST THEN MY PEOPLE DOWN SOUTH SEND THE COCA. YOU THINK I'M STUPID? THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE IN THIS DEAL IS BECAUSE YOU TRANSPORT IT PERSONALLY. ALL RIGHT. I DO HAVE IT. BUT I GOT RID OF IT TEMPORARILY IN CASE MY QUARTERS WERE SEARCHED. KEEP COMING. I'M UNDER SOME UNFORTUNATE SCRUTINY IN MY OWN CONSULATE SO I OVERNIGHTED THE PACKAGE. TO YOURSELF? YES. THAT STORY IS SO LAME I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO BUY IT. CONGRATULATIONS. YOU GOT A NEW BUSINESS PARTNER. BUT ANOTHER BUYER HAS ALREADY PAID. BIG PROBLEM, HUH? YOU GIVE IT TO ME SI.

GOT THESE FOR YOU AND I'M GOING TO NEED A SIGNATURE ON THIS ONE. MISS T. ROMERO. I'M TERESA ROMERO. HMM. I WONDER WHAT IT COULD BE. SECRET ADMIRER? THANK YOU. SECRET ADMIRER, HUH? NOT SO SECRET, I'M AFRAID. GIVE THAT BACK. HEY, EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT YOUR LONG-HAIRED GRINGO OUTLAW. KISSING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE... TERESA... WE DIDN'T KISS. VERY INDISCREET. YOU USED ME? YOU PUT MY CAREER IN JEOPARDY? MY LIFE? TERESA, MI AMOR, WE'RE FAMILY. FINE. LET'S GO OPEN THAT BOX TOGETHER IN THE CONSUL'S OFFICE. BAD IDEA. YOUR ADDRESS ON THE LABEL YOUR SIGNATURE IN THE DELIVERY LOG... VERY INCRIMINATING. WHY DO YOU DO THIS, ESTEBAN? YOU DON'T NEED MONEY. YOU'RE THE AMBASSADOR'S SON. THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I DO IT. OUT THERE, I'M NO ONE'S SON. I'M THE MAN. BY THE WAY, NEXT TIME YOU MEET YOUR FRIEND ASK HIM WHY HE COULDN'T TURN ME IN AT THE COUNTY JAIL AND WHY HE FLED THE POLICE WHEN THEY CAME ABOUT MY PORSCHE, HUH? VINCE, I NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH. BECAUSE I'M WANTED BY THE LAW, THAT'S WHY. AND WHAT CRIME ARE YOU WANTED FOR? MURDER. YOU COULDN'T KILL ANYONE. HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE? I'M SURE. YOU'RE RIGHT. I WAS FRAMED AND FALSELY CONVICTED BY A... CORRUPT POLICE LIEUTENANT. SO NOW YOU RUN. NOW I RUN. YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT ESTEBAN. I GOT SOME KIND OF PACKAGE TODAY AND HE WAS WAITING TO INTERCEPT IT. ABOUT SHOE BOX SIZE, SIX TO SEVEN POUNDS? HOW DID YOU KNOW? THREE KILOS. IT JUST ABOUT MATCHES THE MONEY. WHERE'D HE PUT IT? HE TOOK IT TO HIS QUARTERS, I THINK. HIS CAR WASN'T OUT FRONT. WHERE'D HE GO? I DON'T KNOW. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR THE PACKAGE. HOW, BY KICKING DOWN DOORS? SLOW DOWN, VINCE. I'M SORRY, TERESA, BUT TIME'S RUNNING OUT FOR ME. THAT COP I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT-- HE'S GETTING CLOSER. THIS IS FOREIGN SOIL. I SAID THIS IS FOREIGN SOIL. WHAT? HE CAN'T TOUCH YOU HERE. THE SAME LAW THAT PROTECTS ESTEBAN PROTECTS YOU. ( chuckling ) GREAT. MAYBE I OUGHT TO JUST MOVE IN HERE. MAYBE YOU SHOULD. NICE DREAMS. SOME DREAMS COME TRUE. HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED MARRIAGE? TERESA, STOP. NO. IT'S DONE ALL THE TIME. PEOPLE MARRY TO GAIN RESIDENCY. THEY DON'T MARRY CONVICTED MURDERERS. I THINK OF YOU MORE AS A REFUGEE. SEEKING POLITICAL ASYLUM. WELL, IT'S NOT SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH, IS IT? IT ALSO HAPPENS THAT OUR TWO COUNTRIES HAVE NO EXTRADITION TREATY. YOU'RE SERIOUS, AREN'T YOU? I, UH, HARDLY... I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T... MADE LOVE? MY GRANDPARENTS ARRANGED MY PARENTS' MARRIAGE WHEN THEY WERE BABIES AND THEY MET WHEN THEY WERE TEENAGERS. NOW THEY'RE IN THEIR 60s AND BEEN MARRIED 40 YEARS AND I'VE NEVER MET A HAPPIER COUPLE. BUT WE'VE ONLY KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR TWO DAYS. I BELIEVE IN MY INSTINCTS. TERESA... I CAN'T. YOU CAN... IF YOU WANT TO. LOVE WILL COME SOON ENOUGH. ( car approaching ) COME ON. ESTEBAN...

THERE'S A LOT OF TRADITION THAT GOES WITH THIS BADGE. SOME OF US WOULD RATHER DIE THAN TO SEE IT ABUSED OR DISHONORED. WELL, THAT'S A CLUB I'D LIKE TO GET INTO. GOOD. 'CAUSE THERE WERE A FEW THINGS ON YOUR BAY CITY SHEET THAT, UH... WELL, THAT KIND OF RAISED MY EYEBROWS. SORT OF THE WAY YOU GOT THIS JOB. LET'S GET SOMETHING OUT ON THE TABLE, OKAY? I'VE GOT A WEAKNESS. I'M OVERZEALOUS. I THINK I'M JUST COMPENSATING FOR ALL THE DRONES WHO PHONE IT IN. NOT MANY OF THOSE IN THIS LEAGUE. IF YOU EVER SEE ME OUT OVER THE LINE YOU TELL ME. WE'LL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. BUT IF YOU CATCH ME BEING LAZY OR SLOPPY I WANT YOU TO FIRE ME ON THE SPOT. AGREE? AGREE. ( phone rings ) YOU ANSWER THAT. I'LL SEE YOU INSIDE. DIXON. It's Cortez.

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, JUST REWIND, OKAY? YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED AND MOVING TO COSTA VERDE? YOU SAID IT YOURSELF, BOBBY. THERE'S NO PLACE FOR ME TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY. DIXON WILL FOLLOW ME INTO HELL. WILL YOU TALK TO HIM? RENO, YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO DO THIS? I THINK SO. I'M GOING TO MAKE A LIFE. A REAL LIFE. THIS MIGHT BE MY ONLY CHANCE, CHEY. WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A COUPLE OF WITNESSES. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, BOBBY? NO, HE'S NOT GOING TO NEED ANY WITNESSES. HE NEEDS THERAPY. DON'T MIND HIM. HE'S NOT GOOD WITH CHANGE. SO WHEN'S THE BIG DAY? THIS IS IT. SHE'S WAITING FOR ME RIGHT NOW. TODAY?! THIS IS SOME HACIENDA YOU GOT HERE, CHICO. WE'RE MEETING THE BUYERS AT A PLACE ON SUNSET. AND THESE ARE THE PARTY FAVORS, HUH? DO YOU CULTIVATE BEING ANNOYING OR WERE YOU BORN THIS WAY?

IN 14 YEARS AS A FEDERAL OFFICER I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH PRODIGIOUS RESULTS DELIVERED SO QUICKLY BY A NEW RECRUIT. IN HIS FIRST WEEK ON THE JOB, ROOKIE MARSHAL DONALD DIXON WAS PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SHUTTING DOWN A MAJOR COCAINE PIPELINE OUT OF CENTRAL AMERICA. I'M GOING TO LET HIM TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY. DUTCH? THANK YOU, JACK. THE LINCHPIN OF THIS OPERATION WAS A COSTA VERDEAN DIPLOMAT WHO WAS USING HIS COUNTRY'S OWN DIPLOMATIC POUCH TO SMUGGLE DRUGS INTO THIS COUNTRY. I SIMPLY CONVINCED HIM THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE WITH THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF JUSTICE THAN WITH THAT PACK OF ANGRY DRUGLORDS IN HIS OWN COUNTRY. Bobby: AND I'M SINEAD O'CONNOR. WELL, WHOOP-DE-DO. SAYS HERE THEY DIDN'T RECOVER ANY DRUGS. ISN'T THAT A DARN SHAME. I WONDER HOW DUTCH MISSED THOSE THREE KILOS? ( clears throat ) GUYS... OH. HEY... DO YOU HEAR THE PHONE? I THINK I'M ABOUT TO. WELL, ARE YOU MY HUSBAND? I DON'T THINK WE MADE IT. WE'LL DO IT BACK HOME. MY PARENTS WILL WANT A BIG CHURCH WEDDING ANYWAY... TERESA... I CAN'T. IF YOU'D HAVE DIED, I WOULD HAVE KILLED MYSELF. BUT I'M FINE. THIS TIME. THERE WON'T BE A NEXT TIME. NOT IN COSTA VERDE. WE KNOW THE WAY THIS MAN WORKS. YOU THINK A LINE IN A MAP IS GOING TO STOP HIM? I'LL NEVER FORGET AND I'LL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL. I NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO GIVE YOU THIS. OH, I CAN'T. KEEP IT. TO REMEMBER YOUR WEDDING DAY. WHAT ABOUT YOU? I HAVE MY VERY OWN BULLET HOLE. HOW MANY GIRLS CAN SAY THAT, HMM? AND BY THE WAY, RENO... YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.
