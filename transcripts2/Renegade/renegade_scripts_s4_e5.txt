 Renegade (1992â€“1997): Season 4, Episode 5 - Liar's Poker - full transcript 
 A woman escapes from a correctional facility and goes on the run. Reno and Bobby take on the case, and enlist the help of a local Sheriff. After doing some investigating of their own, they discover the Sheriff hasn't been playing it straight with them, as he has a history of extra-marital affairs with the woman. The more deeply Bobby and Reno get involved in the case, the thicker the lying, deception, scandal, and betrayal gets. They must decide if the case is even worth pursuing or not.

SHE'S A QUICK LEARNER. DID YOU EVER BUST HER? ONCE OR TWICE. SHE'D START CRYING IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE AND SWEAR IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE AND HE'D CUT HER LOOSE. SHE'S THE BEST CON-ARTIST I'VE EVER SEEN. I DOUBT SHE'LL HEAD BACK HERE. HER PARTNER'S LONG GONE WITH THAT MONEY. MAYBE, MAYBE NOT. MEANING? WELL, MEANING IF SHE'S SMART ENOUGH TO PLAN THIS IS SHE DUMB ENOUGH TO LET THE MUSCLE TAKE THE LOOT? SOUNDS LIKE YOU'LL BE STICKING AROUND. IS THAT A PROBLEM, CHIEF? ONLY IF YOU MAKE IT ONE. YOU PLAY STRAIGHT WITH ME I MIGHT EVEN HELP YOU. FAIR ENOUGH. SO, GOT ANY IDEAS WHO THIS MYSTERY MAN MIGHT BE? IF YOU'RE RIGHT THAT HE'S STILL AROUND HERE I'D PUT MY CHIPS ON A GUY BY THE NAME OF CLAY BRIGHTON. BUT WATCH YOURSELF. HE'S NO CHOIRBOY.

HE'S ALSO A SUSPECT IN THE ROBBERY. YOU KNOW MIKE TURNER, THE POLICE CHIEF? HE TOLD ME TO TAIL HIM JUST IN CASE SHE SHOWS UP. ARE YOU WEARING A BADGE NOW? It's our best shot.

THEY'RE NOT ALL THIS EASY, CHIEF. YOU SURE MAKE IT LOOK THAT WAY. YOU NEED A PARTNER, LET ME KNOW. I WILL. THANK YOU. Reno: GUARDS BURNED YOU WITH CIGARETTES? Julie: THEIR FAVORITE PASTIME. THEY CALL IT "BRANDING." THEY DO WORSE. DO A WHOLE LOT WORSE. THE ONE THAT I SHOT WAS TRYING TO RAPE ME. THAT'S HORRIBLE. IF YOU TELL THEM WHO HELPED IN THE ROBBERY THE JUDGE WILL REDUCE YOUR SENTENCE. NO, NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE IT. TRY ME. WELL, IT STARTED WHEN I WAS A KID. GO ON. MY MOM, YOU KNOW, SHE'D DO ANYTHING TO GET DRUGS. SHE'D STEAL OR SELL HERSELF. SOME OF THE MEN THAT SHE BROUGHT HOME CAME AFTER ME INSTEAD. SO... YOU KNOW, I QUIT GOING HOME. SELF-PRESERVATION. YUP. THINGS WERE GETTING PRETTY OUT OF CONTROL THERE. THAT'S WHEN I MET THE OLDER GUY. HE WAS PRETTY NICE. HE'S THE ONE THAT GOT ME THE FACTORY JOB. AND HE GOT HIMSELF A PARTNER ON THE INSIDE. IT'S PRETTY EASY TO SEE NOW, HUH? WELL, I CAN'T HELP YOU UNLESS YOU GIVE ME A NAME. ( whispers ): IT'S MIKE TURNER. THE CHIEF OF POLICE? WELL, HE WASN'T CHIEF BACK THEN. NOW, YOU SEE? I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME. THAT'S WHY I NEVER TOLD BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ME ANY GOOD. WELL, MAYBE IT WILL NOW. VINCE HE USED ME. I WAS JUST A KID BACK THEN. I TRUSTED HIM. WHICH IS WHY YOU LET HIM IN AFTER CLOSING. YES. HE TRICKED ME. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO BACK THIS UP? THAT'S WHY I WAS GOING TO TWIN FALLS. I'M PRETTY SURE I KNOW WHERE MIKE HID THE GUN THAT HE USED. IF IT MATCHES THE PRINTS AND BALLISTICS IT PROVES YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH. WILL YOU PLEASE HELP ME FIND IT? PLEASE? AT LEAST THAT WAY I'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE A FAIR SHOT. ( phone rings ) SIXKILLER.

ANOTHER CASE. BE RIGHT BACK. ALL RIGHT. I'M ALONE NOW. JULIE SAYS HER PARTNER IS MIKE TURNER. THIS GUY'S CLEANER THAN THE TIDY BOWL MAN. SAYS HE PLANNED THE ROBBERY AND SHOT THE OWNER. AND YOU BELIEVE HER?! LISTEN, PAL, BOUNTY HUNTING 101: FUGITIVES LIE. NOT ALL OF THEM. I'm not talking about you. JULIE SEATON WILL SAY ANYTHING TO STAY OUT OF PRISON. She says she has proof. WE SHOULD CHECK THIS OUT BEFORE I TURN HER OVER TO HIM. SHE'S A CON ARTIST; YOU'RE THE MARK. IF YOU'RE RIGHT, SHE GOES TO JAIL WRONG, I SEND AN INNOCENT WOMAN INTO HELL. SO, I'M GOING TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH BEFORE I TURN HER OVER. If we leave now I hit Morro Bay tonight and you tomorrow. So, what do you want me to do with Chief Teflon here? You'll think of something. Bobby, just check him out. WE BETTER HEAD TO THE BEACH. THE FOOD'S SO GOOD AROUND HERE IT ATTRACTS THE COPS. I PROMISE I'LL PAY YOU BACK AS SOON AS I CAN. AS LONG AS IT'S YOUR MONEY. ( laughs ) ( gunshot ) YOU OKAY? JULIE! JULIE! JULIE! ( tires squealing ) ( engine starting ) ( engine sputtering ) ( knocking on door ) BOBBY, OPEN UP! IT'S ME. WHAT? HOLD IT! WAKE UP, BOBBY! COME ON, MAN! OKAY, OKAY! HURRY UP! HEY! OH, MAN! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?! SHE'S GONE! WHAT?! SOMEONE OPENED FIRE ON US IN MORRO BAY. SHE SPLIT WHILE I WAS PINNED DOWN. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH, I'M FINE. THE BIKE TOOK A HIT. HAD TO IMPROVISE TO GET IT RUNNING. MAYBE NOW YOU'LL BELIEVE SHE'S LYING. ALL THIS CRAP ABOUT HER AND MIKE IS A STALL UNTIL HER PARTNER PICKS HER UP. MAYBE THE SHOOTER WAS TRYING TO KILL HER. DID YOU EVER THINK OF THAT, HUH? MAYBE TURNER'S AFRAID THAT SHE CAN IMPLICATE HIM. NO WAY. HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE YOU WERE. HE COULD HAVE FOUND OUT EASY ENOUGH. WHY DON'T YOU JUST ADMIT THAT JULIE CONNED YOU? MAYBE TURNER'S CONNING YOU. IF YOU'D TURNED HER IN SHE'D BE BEHIND BARS RIGHT NOW. DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?! NOW ANY DAMAGE SHE DOES IS ON MY HEAD. SORRY. I'M SORRY TOO. WE JUST GOT TO FIND HER. WELL, I GOT GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS. THE GOOD IS I CONNED JULIE'S CASE FILES OUT OF THE COUNTY CLERK. AND THE BAD NEWS? 7,000 PAGES LONG. WELL, I'LL START SIFTING IF YOU WANT TO GO SIT ON CLAY PIGEON. BRIGHTON. WHATEVER. ( engine starting ) ( phone rings ) Yeah, Bobby, what do you want? HE'S GOING NORTH OUT OF TOWN. You need a backstop? NO, I GOT THIS COVERED. NICE SPOT, ISN'T IT? THE THING I LIKE ABOUT IT IS IT'S SO QUIET. THERE AIN'T NOBODY AROUND FOR MILES. YEAH, WELL, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, FRIEND BUT YOU CAN SEE I'M LOST. YOU KNOW? THE HELL YOU ARE! YOU'VE BEEN TAILING ME. GET OUT! WHO ARE YOU? LOOK, I TOLD YOU I TOOK A WRONG TURN... ( grunts ) YOU A COP? D.E.A.? LET'S HEAR IT, MAN! NO, I'M NOT D.E.A. ( groans ) I'M A BOUNTY HUNTER. THAT'S BOGUS. I AIN'T WANTED. I'M LOOKING FOR JULIE SEATON. I HEARD SHE WAS HANGING OUT AT YOUR JOINT. ( vehicle approaching ) ( yells ) ( gasps ) YOU OKAY, BOBBY? YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS CRETIN GOT THE DROP ON ME. HE'S NOT AS DUMB AS HE LOOKS. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. DID YOU FOLLOW ME HERE? NO, A DRUG DEAL WAS GOING DOWN. WE HAD THIS STAKED OUT. WELL, I OWE YOU BIG TIME. ( grunts ) COME ON, I'LL DRIVE YOU INTO TOWN. TAKE IT EASY. GOING TO MAKE IT? YEAH. OH, MAN. HERE YOU GO. THANKS. SO, WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND TELL ME ABOUT THIS INFORMATION YOU DUG UP. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE IT MUCH. THIS DAY CAN'T GET ANY WORSE WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND HIT ME. THE CHIEF LIED TO YOU ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH JULIE. NOT THIS AGAIN. COME ON. HEAR ME OUT. HE DIDN'T BUST HER JUST ONCE OR TWICE HE'S ALL OVER HER SHEET. TURNER PROTECTED HER. EVEN GOT OTHER COPS TO DROP CHARGES. YOU CAN READ IT ALL FOR YOURSELF. ( sighs ) ONE MORE THING... THERE'S TALK TURNER FORCED JULIE TO SLEEP WITH HIM AS PAYBACK. TALK FROM WHO? LIKE JUNKIES AND DIRTBAGS? NO, PEOPLE IN HIS OWN DEPARTMENT. THERE'S HARDLY ANY MENTION OF BRIGHTON THERE. IF HIM AND JULIE WERE TIGHT, HE'D BE ON THAT. AND BRIGHTON DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHO SHE WAS. COULD HAVE BEEN LYING. WELL, WHY SHOULD HE BE ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS TOWN? I KNEW THIS WOULD CATCH UP WITH ME SOMEDAY. WHY DON'T YOU TELL US THE WHOLE STORY? I DIDN'T FORCE HER. SHE CAME ON TO ME. JULIE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO BUY HER WAY OUT OF TROUBLE WITH SEX. THIS BEFORE OR AFTER YOU WERE MARRIED? MY WIFE AND I WERE HAVING PROBLEMS, YOU KNOW? SO YOU TOOK JULIE'S OFFER. IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE. RIGHT AWAY SHE STARTED ASKING FOR FAVORS. CHARGES DROPPED. I CUT HER OFF AS SOON AS I COULD. AFTER YOU GOT HER THE JOB AT THE FACTORY. I WANTED TO HELP JULIE STRAIGHTEN UP. SHE SAID YOU PLANNED THE WHOLE ROBBERY. NO. I KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO DO IT. YOU KNEW. SHE WAS WORKING THERE AND TALKED ABOUT HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO HIT. I READ HER THE RIOT ACT. THREATENED TO BUST HER ON THE SPOT. NEXT THING I KNOW, SHE DID IT. YOU NEVER SPOKE UP AT THE TRIAL. I WOULD HAVE LOST... MY JOB, MY WIFE, MY KID... I'VE SPENT EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE SINCE THEN SCARED STIFF SOMEONE WAS GOING TO FIND THIS OUT AND TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR IT... TO MY FAMILY AND TO TWIN FALLS. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING. DO YOU BELIEVE HIM? AH, HELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE ANYMORE. GOT HALF A MIND TO BAG THIS WHOLE THING WALK AWAY... NO HARM, NO FOUL. OH, YET. JULIE'S STILL A LOOSE CANNON. SHE WAS A LOOSE CANNON BEFORE YOU MET HER. NO, I LET HER GO. I GOT TO PLAY THIS ONE OUT, BOBBY. ALL RIGHT. TALK TO YOU LATER. YEAH. WELCOME HOME. YOU KNOW, THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MY HOME AND MY ROOM AND MY BED. OUR BED. I BORROWED THIS FROM YOUR WIFE. I HOPE THAT SHE DOESN'T MIND. IF I FIRED, WOULD I HIT ANYTHING? GOD, I MISSED YOU, BABY. ( both laugh ) I DREAMT ABOUT THIS EVERY NIGHT-- YOU AND I TOGETHER AGAIN, LOVING EACH OTHER. ME TOO. REMEMBER OUR FIRST TIME? YOU MEAN IN THE CAR, WHEN... YEAH, WE WERE IN YOUR CAR AND WE WERE IN THE POLICE GARAGE AND MY FOOT ACCIDENTALLY HITS THE SIREN AND OF COURSE, ALL THE LIGHTS ARE FLASHING AND ALL THE COPS CAME RUNNING OUT. AND WE TOLD THEM WE WERE LOOKING FOR YOUR CONTACT LENS. ( both chuckling ) OH, MAN, THAT WAS NUTS. YEAH. WE'RE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY. WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO? I HEAR NEW ZEALAND'S NICE. I BET WE COULD LIVE QUITE WELL ON $300,000 THERE. BE EVEN BETTER FOR JUST ONE PERSON. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I WANT YOU TO HAVE ALL THE MONEY. I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR AFTER WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH. YOU'RE NOT COMING? I LOVE YOU, JULIE. I DO. I'VE NEVER LOVED ANYONE LIKE I LOVE YOU. WELL THEN, THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS, MIKE. IF IT WERE JUST US, I'D LEAVE WITH YOU AND NEVER LOOK BACK BUT I'VE GOT A KID NOW. I LOVE HIM TOO. HE NEEDS ME. BUT I NEED YOU. JULIE, YOU'RE STRONG. YOU'LL FIND SOMEBODY ELSE AND FALL IN LOVE. NO, I WON'T. YES, YOU WILL. ( sobbing softly ) YOU'LL START A NEW LIFE. TAKE THAT MONEY YOU'VE GOT HIDDEN AND BE HAPPY. OH... IT'S A REAL BAD SIGN HOW OVERCROWDED OUR JAILS ARE... ( yelling ) WHEN SCUM LIKE YOU MAKE BAIL. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?! MAYBE YOU GOT SOME INFLUENTIAL FRIENDS, HUH, PAL? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. REALLY? WRONG ANSWER. HEY! TURNER TOLD YOU ABOUT ME, DIDN'T HE? NO. NICE WINDSHIELD. OKAY, OKAY. WHAT DID HE SAY? H-HE TIPPED ME OFF THAT YOU'D BE WATCHING. HE SAID, UH, I WAS SUPPOSED TO KEEP YOU BUSY.
