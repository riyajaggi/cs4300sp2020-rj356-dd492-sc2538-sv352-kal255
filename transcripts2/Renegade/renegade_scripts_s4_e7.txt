IS THIS SOME KIND OF A JOKE? I WISH IT WAS, BELIEVE ME. I WAS CONVICTED OF KILLING A MAN, BUT I DIDN'T DO IT. THAT'S A RELIEF. THAT'S WHY I'M NOT AROUND MUCH. BECAUSE THE POLICE ARE OUT LOOKING FOR YOU. YOU'RE JUST LIKE HARRISON FORD IN THAT MOVIE. IN A NUTSHELL. LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS HARD... NO, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE. YOUR NOT VISITING WAS HARD. ALL THOSE SNEAKY NON-ANSWERS ABOUT DADDY-- THOSE WERE HARD BUT THIS IS JUST PLAIN LYING. NO, IT ISN'T. COME ON, UNCLE VINCE. YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY DAD SO YOU MAKE UP SOME CRAZY STORY ABOUT YOURSELF? I WANTED TO TELL YOU... WAS MY DAD A CRIMINAL? YEAH. BUT HE HAD A CONSCIENCE. WHAT HE DID, HE DID TO PEOPLE WHO WERE A LOT WORSE THAN HE WAS. MY DAD WAS A KILLER, WASN'T HE? IS THIS WHAT EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR? SOME OF IT'S IN CODE, I THINK BUT THERE'S CLIPPINGS IN THE BACK. THEY'RE OBITUARIES. WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? DADDY HID IT IN A METAL CASE WITH A REALLY NASTY-LOOKING GUN. LISA... NOT NOW. PLEASE, DON'T SHUT ME OUT. I SAID NOT NOW.

I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU BACKUP. IF IT WERE JUST HIM ALONE, I COULD HAVE HANDLED IT BUT HE HAD SOME LONG-HAIRED FREAKIN' NINJA ON HIS SIDE. HEY, COME ON. I UNDERSTAND.

BOBBY, LISA'S GONE. WHAT? I TOLD HER THE TRUTH AND SHE TOOK IT PRETTY HARD. HOW FAR CAN SHE GET? PRETTY FAR, I'M AFRAID. I THINK SHE MADE IT TO THE ROAD AND THUMBED A RIDE. That's real bad. Chey just called. GUESS WHO ENDED UP ON THE MORGUE SLAB TWO HOURS AGO? Jack Virgin. AW, MAN. Where does Kenny live? ( doorbell ringing ) HI. HI, LISE. COME IN. TAKE A LOAD OFF.

WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU KIDS TODAY, HUH? COME ON, GET IN THERE. COME ON, MOVE IT. NOW THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR FATHER DID FOR A LIVING? HE WAS A KILLER. WHOA! VERY GOOD. AND I BELIEVE HE KEPT RECORDS... IN A BOOK? IF HE DID HAVE A BOOK, I NEVER SAW IT. I DID FIND A GUN ONE TIME BUT NOT A BOOK. YOU KNOW, I COULD USE SOMEONE LIKE YOU IN MY ORGANIZATION, LISA. GOOD LIARS ARE HARD TO COME BY. I'M NOT LYING. SURE YOU ARE. START BATTING THOSE EYELIDS. ALMOST HAD ME GOING, BUT, UH... OLD BEAVIS HERE GAVE YOU AWAY. WHAT DID I DO? DON'T TWITCH YOUR FOOT WHEN YOU'RE UNDER STRESS. HEY! YOU REALLY LIKE THIS LITTLE FELLA, HUH? DO YOU, UH, REALLY LIKE HIM? DO YOU LOVE HIM? Lisa: PLEASE, MISTER, JUST LET HIM GO. HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING. ( Kenny groaning ) ( grunts ) ABOUT TIME, BIG GUY. UNCLE VINCE, I'M SO SORRY. YOU GUYS OKAY? SHE'S FINE. I'M FINE. WE'RE ALL FINE. LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE. WHERE'S THE BOOK? WHAT BOOK? DON'T DRAG ME THROUGH THAT AGAIN, ALL RIGHT? HER DADDY KEPT A BOOK, RIGHT? SHE GAVE IT TO YOU. YOU BROUGHT IT HERE TO SAVE THEIR LIVES. WELL, I WAS HOPING TO SAVE THEIR LIVES AND KEEP THE BOOK. NICE TRY, BUT WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD, ALL RIGHT? WE'VE ALL GOT OUR OWN AGENDA. IDEALLY, I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE BOOK GIVE YOU ALL AN INSTANT CASE OF AMNESIA AND WALK AWAY. HEY! ALL RIGHT, PONCHO GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT. HERE'S THE DEAL. YOU GIVE ME THE KIDS AND I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I STASHED THE BOOK. YOU GIVE ME THE BOOK AND I'LL KILL YOU ALL. COME ON. WE'RE NEGOTIATING. I'VE GOT TO GIVE MYSELF ROOM TO MANEUVER. ( rock music blasting ) NOT TODAY, MATE. GET UP. COME ON. HEY. THAT'S MY UNCLE. ( doorbell ringing ) HEY, KENNY. HOW'S IT HANGING, VINCE? LISA HERE? I MEAN, UH... HOW DO YOU DO, MR. BLACK, SIR? MAY I INQUIRE IF LISA'S RECEIVING VISITORS? LIVING ROOM. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T LIKE ME ANYMORE. ARE YOU KIDDING? I CAME TO APOLOGIZE. I NEVER SHOULD HAVE PUT YOU IN THAT SPOT IN THE FIRST PLACE. A GUN IN YOUR EAR DOES THINGS TO YOU. YEAH. ( Reno clears throat ) HEY, KENNY, WHY DON'T YOU GO IN THE KITCHEN AND MAKE SOME SANDWICHES? IT WOULD BE MY DISTINCT PLEASURE EXULTED MR. UNCLE, SIR. COOL. ADMIT IT-- YOU LIKE HIM. WELL, I SAW SOMETHING IN HIM YESTERDAY. OH, COME ON, YOU'RE GOING TO MISS HIM. NOT AS MUCH AS I'M GOING TO MISS YOU. I HOPE YOU'RE NOT MAD THAT I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOUR STORY. I HOPE YOU'RE NOT MAD THAT I TOOK THIS LONG GETTING TO THE TRUTH. AND IF YOU NEED TO KNOW ANYTHING ELSE YOU ASK AWAY. YOU KNOW, MY DAD REALLY LOVED ME. YEAH, HE REALLY DID. BOTTOM LINE-- THERE'S NOTHING MORE I REALLY NEED TO KNOW. BUT IF PEOPLE SEE HIS BOOK WILL BAD THINGS COME OUT ABOUT HIM? THAT COULD HAPPEN, LISA. I WON'T LIE TO YOU. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE NICK SNIDER COULD GO TO JAIL. YOU AND BOBBY JUST TRY TO KEEP DADDY'S NAME OUT OF IT. WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN. I LOVE YOU... ( laughing ): UNCLE RENO.
