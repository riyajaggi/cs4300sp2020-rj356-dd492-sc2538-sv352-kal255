However, Bobby finds romance in the strangest of all places, as he falls in love with the victim of a recent automobile accident he was involved in. While all of this is happening, Reno is on the trail of a fugitive, but a strange series of coincidences leads him to believe there may be an ulterior motive to her seduction of Bobby.
