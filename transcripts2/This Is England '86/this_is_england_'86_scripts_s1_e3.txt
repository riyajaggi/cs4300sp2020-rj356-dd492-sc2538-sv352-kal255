 (CROWD CΗANΤlNG) ...3, 4, we dοn't want the blοοdy war! ΤONΥ ΒENN: The one thing thatis so clear is that a majority ofthe British people are opposed to a war. The Navy didn't decide to go to the Falklands. We are standing up for the true interests ofour servicemen. Don't let Mrs Thatcher now shield behind the servicemen and women she has put at risk. You see, truth is the first casualty of war. ΤΗΑΤCΗER: When the Belgrano was sunk, and I ask you to accept this, she was in a position which was a danger to our navy. (WΑVES CRASΗ, SEAGULLS CRΥ)

 (# ΤΗE JAM: English Rοse) # No matter where I roam # I will return to my English rose # For no bombs can ever tempt me from she # I've sailed the seven seas # Flown the whole blue sky # But I return with haste # To where my love does lie # No matter where I go # I will come back to my English rose # For nothing can ever tempt me from she # I've searched the secret mists # I've climbed the highest peaks #And caught the wild wind home
