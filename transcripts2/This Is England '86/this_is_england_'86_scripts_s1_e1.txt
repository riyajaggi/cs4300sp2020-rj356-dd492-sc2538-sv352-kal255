 I know. - Lol, is that mint custard I can smell? - Oh, Get out! Out! Out! - Sorry, sorry. - Out! What you do you want? - Just a little bit of dinner.

 Finished? What are we going to have instead? A fucking knuckle sandwich if you carry on, Gadget. - I'm going to make some new potatoes. - I don't like new potatoes. - Get out! You'll get what you're fucking given. Now go and wait round the back! Gone downhill this place. Here he is. How we looking, Gadge? Not very good, mate. What's up? Well, we've got new potatoes, no chips and for dessert, we've got coffee whip. Ooh, coffee whip's nice. - Are you taking the piss? - No, it's nice. My mum does it all the time. It's dead nice. What are you frowning for, it's free? It's not about the money, is it, Milk? It's about the nostalgia, isn't it? Like, that's why we come here. I don't even know what that means. It means having meals that we used to have when we were happy, when we were kids. When have you ever ate new potatoes and felt happy? "Oh, here's a big plate of new potatoes. Yeah, cheers, Mum." Do not worry, Gadge, them good times will come again. Will they, though? Will they? MUSIC: There She Goes by The La's We're leaving Downing Street for the last time after eleven and a half wonderful years... .. and we're very happy that we leave the United Kingdom in a very, very much better state than when we came here eleven and a half years ago. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Hello, gorgeous boy. Oh, here he is. Where the fuck have you been? Oh, yeah, nowhere. Just the usual. FBI Gadget interrogating me about school dinners. I swear to God, he's smelt a rat. - Has he smelt a rat? - Yeah. - Go on, what's happened? Well, it's the... it's the... it's the dinners. It's the portions he's getting. It's what he's getting. - What's he come away with? - He knows, he knows that what's in our bag isn't in his bag. - I'm telling you. - How does he know? How does he know? He can't possibly bloody know, Milk, if it's in a bag! Yeah, but he hasn't actually seen in the bag because I've managed to fend him off until now. - Good lad. - But he can smell it. I'm telling you, the guy's like a blood hound whenever it comes to anything deep-fried. So what's he actually... What's he come away with then? You see this is the problem, Woods, I actually feel sorry for him. - He came away today with new potatoes and coffee whip. - Oh, shit. I mean, I had to pretend that I like coffee whip and I frickin' hate it. I can't take this pressure any more! What do you mean you can't take this? It's partly your fault, really, isn't it? Cos... - How? - Well, you've just got to be better at what you do! All right, then, here's a solution. Here's a real good solution. - I'll look after the kids tomorrow... - Oh, no. .. and you... Yeah! And you, you go and deal with him. No. You can't swap horses halfway through a race, can you? When's that ever been done? If you want to fix this fast, take him out of the queue! Right, well, that's what needs to happen. Take him out of the queue. Listen, what's going to happen if I pull him out? He's manipulative when it comes to food. What will he do? He's going to go straight to Mr Skipper, that's what he's going to do. He's going to go in that office, he's going to pull the plug on the whole thing. I don't know what else... What do you want me to tell you? - I'm going to have to think on it. - He's daft as shit when it comes to anything in life except for food. Food, I know, I know. It's just not bloody right. What's not bloody right, love? Taking food from kids. I'm not taking it from the kids. If they, if we didn't eat it, it would just go in the bin. It's from the last sitting. There's loads of food in the cupboards here, Shaun, - I just don't see the logic in walking two miles for some. - It's not the same, is it? You can't recreate a good school dinner at home. - It's just not right! - What? Sausage and chips? What's wrong with my sausage and chips? Nothing, it's just... I don't know. No-one knows, do they? It's just school dinners are loads better than normal. Sausage has seen better days. It looks grey. Shaun, is now a good time to talk about college? No, no, it's not. Never is a good time to talk about college. You know you've got to do something about that, Shaun. I don't want to go back to college, Mum! I've told you this... - Why not, love? - .. a million times, cos it's shit. Everyone's up their own arses. I don't fit in there. It's not my cup of tea. I don't want to go. You were great in that school play. Oh, back to this again, are we? Well, if you would've persisted at that, just think where you'd be now. Mum, I hated that fucking course. You know I did. Shaun, it wasn't the course that you hated, it was getting caught up in between that young girl's legs. - I don't know what you were thinking? - How embarrassing! It's bloody true. I don't want to talk about it, Mum. - I know you... - I don't want to talk about it, Mum. I know you've been upset about Michelle. I know you have. - I understand that. - Mum! But you can't spend your life sat around here, and you're never going to meet a young lady, sat around that flat, - smoking them funny fags like them lot. - Mum! One, I don't miss Smell, and two, I'm off out tonight as it happens. Where are you going? Off down to town hall. There's a Madchester thing on. What's a bloody Madchester thing when it's at home? Well, it's like a disco. Have you never heard of The Stone Roses or the Happy Mondays or owt? Yes, I have, actually. Waste of space. You can't hear a word they're saying. They look like they need a bloody good wash and a good sleep and an haircut. MUSIC: Hallelujah by Happy Mondays Is it really, really out of the question to ask for half a cigarette or...? It's finding half a cig to be honest with you, mate. Bit of mix then instead? Three quarters there. Spot on, brother, thank you. Thank you very much. What? What is this show? Is it... It should be called bummy, bummy, bum box telly. It's WrestleMania, Kel. It's a sport. - It's gay. - It's a sport. - Look at these athletes, playing a sport. - Warriors. Warriors. Is there warriors in that? It's not even real. They're warriors. They're trained. Their bodies are trained to fight each other. So you're telling me, your attention right now is not going to them fat, cute, packed little pants. - Yeah, that's what I'm saying. - Why would we be looking at their pants? Look at his sweat patch. It started from his, his "gootchel" area. - He's working hard, isn't he? - And he's sweating all the way up to his bumbershnuck pack. These guys are sweating because they're... These guys are modern day gladiators, mate. All that's missing here is lions and a guy doing, doing all that shit. I bet you're getting a... - a little titchy-tatchy tuna dicky. - Fuck off! MUSIC: Pour Some Sugar On Me by Def Leppard Oh, what the flipping aid is that? Fuck knows. That is unreal, man. That is literally offending my ears, that is. That is fucking ear rape.

You can't cruise very far. - Not in ten seconds. - Not in ten seconds. - Nice one. - Ten second cruise. - Cheers, lads. Wicked. What the fuck do you want, man? Why are you here? It's funny you should say that, Harv. I'm after some of the, er, dopas mopas por favor? - The what? - Come on, Harv, you know what he means, mate. No, I don't. I ain't got a clue. A bit of Pat Cash. What? Some of the old, er, wacktoria backtoria. Are you assuming I'm some drug dealer or summat like that? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's not throw words around like that, Harvey. - Sh. I think we're safe here, lads, to be honest with you. You know, word on the street, you're the Pablo Escobar on this estate. - Yeah? - We've just come to see you. OK. Right, what do you want, then? - A quid's worth. - A quid's worth? Just for tonight. Get it back in the morning. You won't even know it's gone. - Right, you're going borrow a quid's worth? - Yeah, that's it. - It don't work like that, boss. - Let me explain. - There's this bird. - Yeah? - She's going to let me shag her if I can get some of that stuff. Now, she wants the Red Seals but any old shit's sound. So, I'm thinking is, I'm going to let her sniff it - while I'm up to me old tricks in her knick-knacks. - Yeah. Yeah? Pop it back in the wrapper, nip it back round in morning. You don't have to give me the full quid back, just 50p or summat. I'm telling you now, mate, smelling it won't do fuck all. - It will. - No, it won't, mate. It don't work like that. It will. You have to burn it. You have to burn it or inhale it or eat it or summat. - No, it's called sniff banging. - Sniff banging. - Yeah. - Right. - It's new. - It's hot from the States. - OK. Er, well, if I give it you, then, will you take your shit heap and fuck off? - Oh, I'll take that one. Go on, mate. - No worries, mate. Enjoy this. - Very funny. - There you go. There's your fucking quid's worth. There's your molecule. - Thanks. Higgy. - Knock yourselves out. - See you in the morning. - See you later. - See you later. - Enjoy, boys. Yeah, nice one. - Brilliant. - See you in a bit. - Take care. - Take it easy. - Lovely. What a rush! I can see why that's addictive. I feel like Anthony Montana!

They have no cream on, have they? She's fine. We've put some sheets up and stuff. She's made a little kind of pink tent, pink palace, she says. - Pink palace. - She's great with them, isn't she? - Yeah, she is, yeah. Is she staying here then at the minute or...? Yeah, just for a bit. She's here, sort of now and then. A few nights, you know? - What's a few nights, like? - Well, a few nights a week, you know? - A few nights a week? - Four or five. It's not been easy for her at home. They've had a bit of erm... - Her mum and dad have split up. - Oh! - So she's just stopping here while it, y'know? - It's a shame. Give her a bit of stability, you know, a bit of a normal family life. So she's come to live here, my ex-lover, she's... now she's living here? - Well, at the moment, yeah. - At the moment, yes. It's just... She offered us rent, actually, didn't she? - She offered you rent? - She did. - You said... - We said no. - Well, we both said no, didn't we? That's a really good idea. Shall we sing? ♪ Twinkle, twinkle little star! ♪ I might just go... I might just go and have a little look. It's just the lack of cream on them. No, no, can you... Richard. Sit down. Jimmy burns. It's his ginger hair. No, honestly, it's fine. Sit down, sit down. There's a little something, isn't there, that er... We've got a bit of er, well... - It's a bit of a surprise. - A surprise? - We like to think... - The kind of surprise where your kids can't be in the room, kind of surprise? No, it's so you can concentrate on it. Call it our Cilla moment, if you will, so... - What is it? - Is it a big black dildo? - Bosh! - Oh, come on, son! - Bzzzzzzzz! - Stop it, son! - Really, no. - Went too far. I shouldn't have done it. - So, what's...? - That's a moving cupboard with a grunting thing in it, isn't it? - That's got to be it, hasn't it? - Is that the surprise? It's a puppy, isn't it? - Shall I er...? - Is it a pig? - One, two, three, four. - It's moving. - You can come out now! Hey! Surprise, surprise! - It's Mr Squires! - It is, isn't it?

Come here, give us a hug. - Surprise! - You weren't expecting that, were you, son? - You're always saying we're boring. - Yeah. Not so boring now, are we? Ha, ha, ha! - Surprise, surprise! - Mr Squires in a cupboard! Wouldn't call that boring! Smell. Smell. Ay up. Shaun. How are you? All right? Yeah, I'm fine. Good. You look really nice. Mm. Thanks. The blue really suits you, in your hair. Is that a real bird? No, I'm a fucking vegetarian. So, er, how's all the college going? Are you still doing - all your drawings and that, enjoying...? - Yeah, great. Would, erm...? Later on there's this thing at the town hall. It's like a Madchester thing. Like a mad rave. There's, erm, all the gang are getting together and that. We're all going to go, if you fancy it? I don't think that would be a very good idea. Well, why not? I've met someone. What do you mean, you've met someone? I've met someone. He's called Harrison, and I really like him. Sorry, Shaun. Well... good. You know... .. I'm happy for you. You deserve better than what I did to you, don't you, so... I'm pleased you're moving on. Right, well, I better get going anyway, so... At least think about coming tonight, yeah? All right, I'll think about it. - All right? - I'm cool, yeah. All right, I'll see you later. You see, the reason why I'm here is cos I'm going solo. I'm leaving the firm. I gave them the opportunity to pay me what I was due, and they turned me down flat. - They fired you? - So I'm setting up on me own! - Wow. That's brilliant! - It's amazing, isn't it? - Back here, back where I belong. - Really brave! - Brilliant. - That's awesome. - There's more. - I want you with me. - Oh, now then. - Back where you belong, - by my side! - Yeah. - Eh? - And I'm not just talking wages here. - Yeah. I'm talking about partnership. Well, junior partnership. - A junior partnership? - Profit share, profit share! - And what I'm offering you here, lad. - Yeah? - I'm offering you the stars. I'm offering you the moon on a stick and a bag to put it in. - I'm offering you the world! - Amazing, that's fantastic. - But the thing is... - It wouldn't really work, would it? It wouldn't really work because of the children. - He's got the kids. I'm at work. - You could look after the kids. She's doing her... dinner lady. - No, I run the kitchen. - She's not just a dinner lady, though, Mum. - I'm there full time. - She's in charge of the kitchen. - OK, well... But I want you to see the potential here, Rich. Do you know what I mean? - I want you to understand what he's offering you, lad. - No, I do. I get it. I do get it. What about if Lorraine doesn't have to leave her job? You can keep doing your boss dinner lady. - I can't leave my job. - And maybe Jennifer could look after the kids? No, no. My former lover look after the children instead of their mum and dad? - That WOULD be comfortable(!) - I'll be honest, I'm not comfortable with that. - You've got to see the potential. - Think about it sensibly. To me, it looks a bit like you're struggling. - We're fine. - What do you mean, it looks like we're struggling? I don't... Hang on a minute. Whoa! I don't comment on you and your matching weird psychopath gear. - Now, that's just rude. - He agrees. You're being rude with me, Mum. - I'm not being rude. - Assuming... We might look like a bag of... Stop talking. Don't you judge me and my family! We might look like a bag of unorganised shit sometimes, pal, but we are... We're fucking happy. Isn't that every parent's dream! - You fucking presumptuous pair of arseholes! - Woody! That's it. OK. Let's just all calm down. You've pissed me off big time! - All right, all right, son. That'll do, that'll do, that'll do. - You've gone way over, way over the mark. - I think maybe... - I just want to smash the fucking front room up. - Sh. - I think we should take a break. - Trying to make us wear slippers and shit in the front room. What's happened to you? - This has obviously not worked. - No, it hasn't fucking worked. It's pissed me off! - Let's just take a minute. - All right, son, all right. - Maybe a cup of tea. - I agree with you. Coffee or summat, I don't know. - Presuming! Pre-fucking... Making out... - Sh! - We might look like shit, but we're fucking happy! - OK, well, we'll just sort it out. - She's crying now! - Yeah, course she is. Fucking water works. Wowee!
