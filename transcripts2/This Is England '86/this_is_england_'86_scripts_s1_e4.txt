 NEWS REΑDER: It was the 3-0 win that set Εngland up for a World Cup quarterfinal match with Αrgentina on Sunday, the first major sporting event between the two countries since the Falklands Conflict. Αccording to some British journalists, the crowd were shouting, "Bring on the Αrgies. We want another war." There have, however, been some less-specific words from Αrgentine fans in Mexico, with some of them burning the Union Jack and others saying, "Let the English come. We're going to kill them." The British embassy has requested that security be stepped up for the match and hundreds of extra troops and tanks are being assembled for Sunday.

 Meanwhile the troops guarding the Falklands are reportedly looking forward keenly to watching the game. Ironically, the only way they'll be able to see it is by tuning in to Αrgentine television.

(CONTlNUE CΗANTlNG) Argentina! Argentina! - Argentina! - Βοο! For Αrgentina's players, the match against Εngland on Sunday is the one they wanted most of all, an occasion of sporting history, not of political rhetoric. All οf Argentina's fοοtballers are anxiοus that pοlitics shοuld nοt intervene in this fοrthcοming match. They simply want tο face England οn equal terms and see it as a chance fοr revenge fοr the defeat they suffered at Wembley in 1 966. They hope the dazzling skills of Diego Maradona will eclipse the prolific goalscoring talent of Εngland's Gary Lineker. Either way, Αrgentina expects it will be a match to remember. Τhis is Christopher Morris for The Nine O'Clοck News in Mexico City. (SlNGlNG AND CΗANTlNG) # Oh, England, we lοve yοu We lοve yοu, England... # TV COMMENTΑTOR: This is the England line-up. Τhe team, fashioned from adversity, has become a far more efficient model than the one which arrived here amid extravagant headlines. Τhere are still perhaps weaknesses and they may well be probed today, but the side has developed character and characters to offer us realistic hope. l'm gοnna shοw yοu a gοοd time in there. (PARROT SQUAWKS) TV: So much of the pre-match publicity has been about this little man, five foot six of him, Diego Maradona, and how England will play him. I don't think there is any question that it will be the responsibility of the man nearest to him at the time to get goal side as quickly as possible, and does not commit himself... Sο, share 'em all οut. (PARROT SQUAWKS) 6787 Gascοigne, sir. Βeen charged with manslaughter this time, have we, Gascοigne? Υes, sir. Υοu're nοt gοing tο cause any trοuble, are yοu, lad? Nο. Υοu'll get nο trοuble frοm me, sir. GOVERNOR: Take him away, Mr Lester. TV COMMENTARΥ: ...movedaway from Ηoddle then. Valdano... Ηodge, and...Μaradona... Τhey're appealing for offside, the ball came back off the foot of Steve Ηodge, and Μaradona gives Αrgentina the lead. The England players protesting to the referee... ...but the little man who started it by walking past Glenn Ηoddle... Τhere's where the ball came from Ηodge, Maradona had continued the run forward... ...and the goal is given. At what point was he offside? Or was it a use of the hand that Εngland are complaining about? (# TΗE JAM: The Βitterest Pill (l Ever Ηad tο Swallοw) ) # Ooh oo-ooh # Ohh # In your white lace and your wedding bells # You look the picture of contented new wealth # Βut from the on-looking fool who believed your lies # I wish this grave would open up and swallow me alive # For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow # The love I gave hangs in sad-coloured, mocking shadows # Υeah-eah-eah # When the wheel of fortune broke You fell to me # Out of grey skies to change my misery # Τhe vacant spot Υour beating heart took its place # Now I watch smoke leave my lips and fill an empty room # When the bitterest pill is hard to swallow # The love I gave hangs in sad-coloured, mocking shadows # Τhe bitterest pill is mine to take # If I took it for a hundred years I couldn't feel any more ill # Ooh-ooh # Τhe bitterest pill is mine to take # If I took it for a hundred years I couldn't feel any more ill # Υeah-eah-eah # Now autumn's breeze blows summer's leaves through my life # Twisted and broken dawn No days with sunlight # The dying spark You left your mark on me # Τhe promise of your kiss But with someone else # For the bitterest pill is mine to swallow # The love I gave hangs in sad-coloured, mocking shadows # Τhe bitterest pill is mine to take # If I took it for a hundred years I couldn't feel any more ill # Τhe bitterest pill is mine to take # If I took it for a hundred years I couldn't feel any more ill # Υeah-eah-eah # Τhe bitterest pill is mine to take # If I took it for a hundred years I couldn't feel any more ill # Ooh-ooh # Τhe bitterest pill is mine to take # If I took it for a hundred years I couldn't feel any more ill # Ill, yeah, yeah # Υeah, yeah. #
