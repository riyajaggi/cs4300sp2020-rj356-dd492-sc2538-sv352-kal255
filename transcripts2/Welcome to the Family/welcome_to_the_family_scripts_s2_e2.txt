 - How are you? - Manu, what the fuck are you doing here? 200,000 euros to recover the apartment that was seized from you. - I want him out right now! - Wait a moment. - Angela! It's just that I can't. - Out! They're chasing me. These two individuals participated in the robbery of a very valuable ring called Blue Dream. Why wouldn't The Curse come to me? Right? If not that... Oh, maybe you have a little brother, dearest? No, what I’m telling you is you have menopause.

 And this girl has the theory that Manu changed the good ring for the bad. - Tell me you don't have it, the ring. - I don't have the ring. - Okay, I believe it, I believe it. - I vote we help Manu. - I vote no. - Alex. No, I'm with Angela, it's none of our business. I knew it, I knew it. I'm pregnant! If you play us again, this time I will make you pay.

What the fuck are you doing? Looking for the fucking ring, but I can't find it. Okay, when are you going to accept that he doesn’t have it? Just because I can’t find it doesn’t mean he doesn’t have it. Can we talk? Have you talked to Manu yet, have you told him we're together? I still haven’t found the time. Well, no, I don't talk to cowards. (door: closes) (clearing throat) Are you OK? Were you able to sleep? I brought you a thing of milk. Do you want it, hm? M'm mcmff immomumn. Huh? Ah. I said I'm lactose intolerant. Ah, well. Teresa, really, we are not kidnappers. Oh no? Sorry,  it's just that the tied hands and the gag had me confused. Oh, no, no, Teresa, we're a normal family. And. Well, we are a family. Hm? And like any mother, then, I... I don't want anything to happen to my children. - So let me go. - I can't. You want the ring and you won’t leave until you find it. But I don't have to find it, I know exactly where it is, Angela. Manu has it. Seriously, I-- I really want to believe you. Look, Manu is a rat. - Mm-hm. - And I hate him as much or more than you. But... but I've ransacked all his stuff, and no sign of it. He has it, but he’d have hidden it somewhere no one can find it. And what do we do? Obviously he won’t give it to us. Or maybe he will. I think there is a way to do it so that Manu himself returns the ring to us. But you have to help me. Eh... # # WELCOME TO THE FAMILY (door: opens) Where are you coming from? Me? From-- from-- from... from... from here-- from the toilet. - And what do you care? - Okay, okay. Look, a moment of attention, please! After meditating all night on what we can do with the prisoner and to assess the legal possibilities we have, I have come up with a unique solution, the cleanest and most effective solution, which is... Mm... Oh... Um... What solution?! Oh yeah, sorry. Kill her. - Are you crazy or what? - It wouldn't be the first time, would it, Angela? They say the second time is easier. - Uh...what are you talking about? - Never mind. For the last time, we didn't kill my father. Bravo, "bravissimo", every time you say it it's more convincing. Listen to me, I have another idea. I talked to Teresa and I asked her if there was any possibility, however small, that the ring was held by someone other than Manu. - And what did she say? - That she is convinced that he has it. She's lying. You know her, she's a professional liar. No... I don't have it. Listen, if we set out to kill her like... - No, we will not kill anyone! - Wait a moment... Let me finish, please? After much insistence, in the end, she ended up admitting that yes, there's a small possibility... that the ring was held by another person. - Jesus. - Who? Her brother. Nile. Seriously? Wow, you have to... you have to be shameless, how can you betray your own family like that? - Am I right, "bro"? - And more, and more, and more... Nile? Do you mean? If not, how the hell do I know her brother's name is Nile? (Nando) So what do we do? What is the plan? Let's go to the house of this Nile and ask him, or how? (Raül) Well, yes, it's a possibility. No, it is not a possibility. I know Nile and he is as or more dangerous than his sister. We would get in trouble. Sure, I get it, we can't ask for it just like that, we have to use the element of surprise, eh, take it by force and... What are you saying? What are you saying? No, no... It's just that you don't know these people. It's not... It's that it would be suicide, no... So what do we do? We can't have this chick tied up for life. - We will propose an exchange. - Mm-hm. We'll call Nile, anonymously, and we will tell him that we have his sister kidnapped, and that we will only release her in exchange for the ring. Um... Angie, I don't think that's a good idea. I-- I don't see it. Can you think of another possibility? No, because you just put up hurdles everywhere but you don’t propose anything. I wish I had the solution, but I can't think of it, okay? It’s obvious, isn’t it? If you don't have it, he has it. But, eh... I think, as your lawyer, the best we can do is an exchange. This idea of ​​killing her is crazy. It was your idea. Oh, yes, Angela? Mine? Come on. - Listen! Seriously, I don’t see it. - Come on, enough talking about it, let's go. No, no, Nando, eh... Yes, sure. Eh... Bollocks. # Knock knock. # Who is it? Open the door... # - What do you want, Mom? - # Knock knock. I opened it for youuuu. # Wait a moment. - # (chimes) # - Okay. - What are you doing, Mom? - (clears throat) One fine day little Victoria was born. What a beautiful girl! One day she noticed how something was growing inside her. "Oooh!", she thought. "What must this be? What can it be? A mouse?" No no no. "What can it be? Is it Patufet?" - No, no, no. - Hey, what are you doing, mom? Do you want to wait a moment, please? Surprise! Pop! It was little Alex. For many years, mother and daughter were soooo happy together. Until, over the years, by surprise, oh... Again? Mom, Mom... You want to shut up for a moment. Whoops! The little I-don't-know-what appeared. End of story. Did you like it? Mom, I don't want to know where you were getting those dolls from, do I? Ugh, girl, that doesn't matter. Did you get the thesis or not? Eh? Yes, but you are not pregnant, the doctor told you. You have menopause. - Well, she made a mistake! Madam Medicine. - Yeah, sure. Look. Oh, Mom, stop getting things out of there, it's just... Give me a moment, please. Look. "Positive!" So? I knew it wasn’t menopause. You can't accept that I know myself. It can't be, it must be a mistake. These things sometimes fail. - I've taken three, three pregancy tests. - Three? I swear to you, three, and all three have agreed: positive, positive, positive. So, what've you got to say now, brownie, huh? No, it's just that it can't be, this can't be happening. What's wrong with my dethroned princess? Mom... But you'll always be my right eye, eh. Shut up, that's not it. Mom, I care about you. At your age it is definitely dangerous. Oh, please, Alex, at my age... But right now women are having children at the age of 36, I'd be trendy. You've spent many years 36, eh. Aaaah! Mom, seriously now, you can't have her, this creature. Listen, what does that mean? Who do you think took care of you? A fairy godmother of the forest? I took care of you, honey. Make no mistake, I am miraculously alive. I don’t think that would happen twice. Right? Listen, now I also have Raül, whether you like it or not, it's something else. - Jesus fuck, Raül. - Alex. - Have you said anything to him? - No, girl, I plan to tell him today. I'm ready, I'll make him lunch. I will put candles on it and put 4 cartons of tobacco with it. - 4 cartons of tobacco? - Yes, 4 packs of tobacco. I don't want your father's thing to happen to me, when I told him, he said, "I'm going to buy tobacco, I'll be right back." - Fuck, don't you see you can't? - Come on! Where there's a will, there's a way! Mom, tell me something, will you stop drinking? - If I decide to I can stop drinking... - No. - Yes. - Shit, you don't even believe yourself. - Aaaaah! - Victòria! - What are you doing, Mom? Stop screaming! - What's going on? I'm calling you. Pl-- please, uh, uh, can you give us our mother-daughter time? - Fine... - Sounds fair, doesn't it? Okay, come on in, we have a plan. Hm? Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming. I come because I'm hungry, not because you tell me! Oh my God! See, I'm responsible. I'm hungry, I eat. That is not being responsible. You have no idea what it’s like to be responsible, Mom. Bossy pants. (Nil) Yes? (Nando) Hello, ah... Let's see, you, you don't know me, okay? Me either, listen for a second, uh... yes, I call to tell you, it's all good, that... that, that, that we have your sister... and if you give us the Blue Dream, we'll give her back to you. "What the fuck are you saying, dude?" "Look, so good prank, hm, why don't you go bother your mother? " (phone clicks) He hung up on me. But... but what are you doing? You have to seduce him. No, it's no use, eh. We tried it, it didn't work out and that's it. Bro, you did great. Yes, man, and what else! I’m seeing that you’ve got the chops. Do him a favor and leave him alone, give him a chance, please, to show what he can do. Listen to me, please. You are now... Turco Mcguire. I like Turco, don't you? It's simple but it's beautiful, Turco, Turquet. Your mother loved you, but she left you, they forced her to leave you. They told her it was too much responsibility for her, poor wretch. This has created an inferiority complex for you which causes you to kill people. Yes, he has, Turco has killed people, but Turco is not afraid of anything, eh. Isn't it true, Turc, that you're not a coward? Don't you hate when someone thinks you're a coward? "Hey, little coward, chicken, chicken..." Yes, of course. That’s true, yes, I’m not a coward. I am a brave man, a brave man who waits for the right moment, but, bollocks, a brave one after all. - If you say so. - Come on, now we've got it, go. Come on, come on. (Nile) "Is it you again?" Listen to me, son of a bitch, give us back the ring or we kill your sister, do you hear me? "But I don't have the ring!" “I don’t have the ring,” are you stalling me or what? I have her here in front of me! Either you return the ring to us or she gets shot in the head! "What do you not understand? I-don't-have-the-ring!" (phone clicks) Seriously? Was I bad again? No, me for me, no. I don’t know what could have happened. For me, I thought you killed it, okay, I liked it. Actors put on a blanket after each “take”. Do you want a coffee or something? Yes, the blanket, but you didn't earn it, now he thinks that we're posers incapable of killing anyone. He doesn't know who he's talking to, does he, Angela? It’s the best thing that could happen to us, believe me. - Wait for me here, I'm going to the bathroom. - Back to the bathroom? - You've been going a lot, haven't you? - And what the fuck do you care! It's true, guys, when you gotta go, you gotta go. (door: opens) Nope, it's not working. Manu hasn't confessed and your brother has blown us off. That idiot Manu is waiting for the plan to fail so as not to have to remove the ring. Well, what do we do? Ah... You will have to be more convincing with Nile. Fran, I need to talk to you. I already told you that you and I have nothing to talk about. Yes, I know, I know... but I have a problem and I need to talk to someone about it, please. - You have a problem? What, what's going on? - I mean, it’s not me, it’s my mother. Ah... Victoria? Is she okay or...? - Um... - What? She's pregnant. Oh... But it-- it-- it can't be, right? It looks like it, we've done a thousand tests and all have come out positive. Wow. That's crazy. And no matter how much I tell her she can't have it, that is, don’t get off the donkey if you don’t know how to do it. And why can’t she have it? Are you joking? Because she's my mother, she can't have a kid. But she could, no? I mean, I don’t know, she's already old enough to know how it's done. She’s my mom, she never knows how it's done. Ah. Fuck, if you knew what it's like. And how is it, eh? How... how is it, how is it? How are you, Alex? What is it, that she's a freak like me, right? That's it. What... what do you say? Why did you vote against my father? - What's next, this, now? - No, answer me, please. Okay, so since you ask, I did it for you, hm. To protect you, because I don't want your father to hurt you again. And you had to decide for me, like with your mother. Because we're fools, right? We cannot make decisions for ourselves. Well, maybe yes. It's true, Fran, for some things you're very smart, but for others, not so much, eh. All right, so next time you can save it, thank you. Look, I'm sorry I hurt you, but even if you don't realize it, I swear I did it for you. Yes? From now on, I ask you, please, please, may you never help me again. # ("In your hands", Marta Aguilera) Can time goes by. # No one is there to hold you tight. # And leaving all your... # - What, did you get mad at Alex? - I am aware, thank you. You gonna tell me what's going on, or what? Don't make me talk, David, don't make me talk. So, you're angry with Alex now... because she voted against Dad, right? Dude, I voted against Dad, too. You also pissed with me? It's different, David, he's your father, you've every right to be angry. # ...in your hands, in your hands, # in your hands. # Bro? Bollocks, what a scare! You fucked me up, I thought you were Angela. - And why the fuck are you in her room? - Why are you? Eh? For La Sareta, who still... Ah. Listen, don't you think she's being very weird lately? Who? I don’t know, she seems to be hiding something. - Angela? - Yes. No, man, no. I don't know, no, no. I find her a very, very transparent person, you see it... you see it in her face, no?, a woman who hides nothing. No, no, why... why... why do you ask? - Do you remember the Rabbit? - Who? The one with the teeth that couldn't shut his mouth, ah, that was... - Ah, Jesus, yes. - The Rat's brother. He went crooked. He was the same but with smaller teeth. - He was the Rabbit's cousin. - They're all from the same family. - What happened to that one? - He also went to the toilet a lot. - (sniffs) - No. No way, bro. - I think so. - You're implying that Angela is taking drugs? - Are you looking for drugs, bro? - Let's see, eh... Family, family! Come, come here, I had another idea! What? - No. No, man, no. - She's getting high all day. What do you have here? Hm, hm, hm... Per favor... (hoarse voice) You have two hours to give us the Blue Dream, or I kill her. Hm! Hm! Cut, cut! - Now what's wrong? - He has no strength. Oh! We've recorded it 23 times and you don't like any of it. Let's see, we'll play a little. Come on, let's play a little, yes. “Love,” listen to me well. Now we will play. I'm going to remove the "gag", eh, Nando? Come on, let’s all relax and imagine, okay? Let's see, you're small, your mother isn't very responsible, she always leaves you locked inside the car with the "spout lowered"... You’re like a hamster in a cage, you with me? What is she talking about? Let's try something different. How can I explain? I've got it! Imagine, for example, that you are kidnapped. I am kidnapped, you crazy bitch! Exactly! From here, from here, don't come down, darling! Thank you so much. Nando, everything was great, eh, darling, as always. Listen, whatever you do, don't overdo it with the hoarse voice, because you don't feel it; it's a problem for sound, not for you, okay? Let me see? The, the... Yeah, yeah, that sucks shit like a cathedral. What do you want to tell me, what are you telling me with your frame? You know something, let’s stop for a moment, please, and that’s for everyone. If we don't know how to do our job well, Blow out the candles and let's go home and close the beach bar, period. - Nothing's gonna happen. - Enough! We'll send the last one. - Listen, you're not the director. - No, neither are you. Wanna bet, I am responsible for this whole film crew. Who? What crew, huh? What crew? Are you losing your mind or what? It's us! We're not playing here, Victoria, what we're doing is very serious. Listen, I'm not playing games either, huh? Why do you yell at me, because I wear a beret? Does the beret make you angry? - No, you make me angry! - Ah, yes? Well you know what? Eh? What you cook, is what you eat And I don't paint anything, okay? Always total shit for me, I always do everything wrong, and shit for me always, the last monkey in the house! Victoria! (bump) What is this? Looks like they want to open the door from the outside. - Pull, pull. - (Alex) What was missing. - Come, help me! - Hide it. - Don't shout! - Jesus! - Behind the fridge. - Shh! Shut up! - Helllp! - Shh, shut up! - Hellllp! - Shhh! # (loud music) # Ah, you're here! It's just we've been stung before, but no... I can't believe this. You’re noticing the music, aren’t you? Old speakers, but the quality... - What, what do you want? - We bought this van... Tadah! Spectacular, huh? It's a limited edition "vintage" van. They only made 328 of this model, she’s over 30, and look at her, look at her, eh? Sounds like it came from the factory, right, darling? Yes, we're leaving for a few days. And, well, I need it more than ever... you know... to overcome Eduardo's death, because I still don't... I still carry him here. - "Always in my heart." - That's great, Adela, and...? And? Ah, I don't know. I guess time has to pass... Oh, my God. Ah, the van. We were wondering if we could leave her here for two days... - (Teresa) Hellllp! - Our garage is under constrution... Uh, did you hear that? Must be the kids playing doctor. Ugh, help..., help... Ow, ow. - Man man man... - (clears throat) You and I don't know each other, do we? Well no. No, I know, I wouldn't forget a face so... so symmetrical. Hi, I'm Adela, the neighbor in front. I am Peter, the husband. Delighted, eh. - Equally. - And you? Uh, I'm Manu. Manu, eh? The Maiqui. And who is Manu? Is he a family friend? - Ah! - Ah! - Now you've met my brother. - That! Ah! Is he your brother? Ah, you must be happy. But wait a minute, didn't your brother clean pools? Is he your ex? Yes, yes, there, there you have it. - He, here, is. - (Manu) Yes, I'm here... He has come, and since the pool was already clean, now... She kept it perfectly, the pool. So now he has decided to clean the garage. Yes, because here, like it or not, it builds up... - It doesn't seem like it, but it needs dusting... - I did and there it was... - Man. - Ouch, we... - (Manu) Very brown. - Because sometimes... Peter doesn't even know what a broom is. No, because sometimes you don't know very well... And you? Do you write? - No. - Ah, and have you tried it? Hey, listen, if you want to leave the "vintage" van here in the garage, you will have to wait for it to be clean. Oh, we’re in no hurry, are we, darling? Eh? No. It's just that this jewel must sleep under a roof. Hey, look, here's what we'll do, since we don't have a clean garage yet, once we clean it, we'll park it for you. Yes, okay, but if you could rub her with a damp cloth, neither too cold, nor too hot, lukewarm. Sure, sure, we will. A little shine. - Goodbye, Manu. - Bye! Ow! She bit my hand, Dad! The mother who gave birth to you! Enough of this nonsense, you understand? - (crunching bones) - Jesus! Aaah! Aaaah! Jesus! Oh, oh, oh, and-- and-- blood's coming out of your nose. I'm going to clean up, I'll be back. Crazy bitch, boy! Aaah... aaah... Aaah... aaah... Aaaah... Aaah... Bollocks. That was it. (recording: Teresa) "Hm! Hm! Hm!" (Nando) "You have two hours to give us the Blue Dream." What? What? What do you think? I'm not saying anything, since I always screw up. It’s a good video-threat. I’ve received a lot of them throughout my life and I assure you it fucks. - Is this better than the previous one? - I do not know. I don't know, because this one has some nuances that the other one doesn't have, I don't know. Sorry. Angela, can we talk for a moment, please? Well right now, Manu, if you remember, I'm a little busy saving your ass - (Nando) Come on, let's send this one. - Yes? Everyone agrees? - Yes Yes. - (Raül) Yes. Yes, no? Done! - No, no, no, wait! - Too late. - "Diana's been cast". - "The die is cast", darling. Right, that. We're in shit, we're in shit, but deep shit. Why? After that, if I were him and had the ring, I don't know, I wouldn't mind confessing it. What do you think? Of course, of course, yes, no, he will have no choice. (Raül) Sparrow, come with me. And now what are we waiting for? Isn’t it a good time to talk to him? Now? Not now, he's very nervous now. He'll get over it, Nando. It's... it's that I don't know why you're in such a hurry. And I don’t know why you don’t want to say it. Well, perhaps you are a little cowardly? Let's not go back to that with the coward, I’m not a coward. - You want me to tell him? I'll tell him. - I'll believe it when I see it. Tell me what? Huh? Tell? - Yes. What? - Tell? (Phone) Ah! They're finally calling. Take it, Turco. Shh! (cough) (husky voice) Yes. (Nile) "Okay. I have the ring." "I'll give you the address and time of the exchange." "If something happens to my sister, you're all dead." Well, then... we did it, didn't we? So... you don't have the ring? No, woman, you haven't been following the plot, have you? Gentlemen, congratulations, it has been a brilliant operation. And this one without deaths, eh, Angela? - I don’t want that now. - I do. Now we have nothing to celebrate. Is that why you're not drinking or... is there another reason? No, that's why. When we have the ring I will celebrate, period. Now. Look, I know these people and they won’t let go of the Blue Dream. I wouldn't go there. Oh, yes, you're very much going with us. You will come with me and Nando, and all this will end today. (mobile: message) We have the address. We can't take my car, they would recognize me. Mine either, it’s very small. We'll go... in Adela and Pere's van, since they left us the keys. For you. - Okay. - (keys: clinking) No, I had some pant--..., look, it was these, these, these. - But aren't these very white? - No, look, that's fine, come on. How do these look? Jesus, what a fright! I thought it was another chick’s leg. What? Oooooo! # I'm a zombie, blah blah blah... # Oh no, that was another... - Thanks. - Thanks for what? Whenever I’m feeling bad, you get me to laugh. What's wrong, darling? Are you worried or something? Something happened with Fran, huh? Patience, woman, these things work out in the end. I don’t know, Mom, I blew it. - By thinking I'm always right. - Oh my God, "I blew it"... Well something tells me that soon you will be two "lovebirds" again. Yeah, sure, you're always so happy when you drink Listen, Alex, I haven't drunk all day, huh? Mom, and what is that? What's this? Water, mineralized with Catalan gas, for health. - Sure. - Please, try it, please. Mama. Drink for a moment, please. It's water. Fucker, that's what I've been telling you, please, I'm a loser you will never believe me, never! Please. Um... What are you looking at? I have blackheads, right? I thought so the other day, I swear to you. Tell me the truth, do I? Mom, you really want to have this kid, right? Me? Tell you the truth? Yes..., a lot..., Alex. Okay, you know that you'll have to take care of him, feed him, clean his pee-pee, the poop. Alex, Alex, I'll do it, darling. - Yes, and he will have to go out too. - He will have to go out. I swear to you, and honey, I tell you this very seriously, I swear I'll take him for a walk every day of his life. Honey... I swear to you, I swear to you. I swear to you. You should talk to Raül and tell that idiot that he's going to be a father. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! - Thanks! - Okay. You know what, darling? Can I just say? Can I tell you something, honey? I know that you would not have chosen me as your mother. Well, don't worry. But I want you to know that I, eh, a thousand times, would have chosen you as my daughter. And that Raulito will have the best big sister in the world. - Mom... - The sister, xufi, rexufi. Swear to me you'll look for another name, poor boy, eh? - You don't like Raulito's name? - Yes, I love it. - I like it. - Mom, take this off, you're going to drown. - Oh, girl, I'd already forgotten. - I'll take these, eh? I like Raulito, there aren't many, it's unique. Listen, I know you told me... that you didn’t know if Angela had or hadn't been with someone, but if she had been with someone... do you know who she'd be with? - I don't know, with no one. - She's been with someone. And recently. - Recently? - Yes. - I don't know, let me think about it. - Think. - No way, there's no one. - Think, she's been with someone! I said no. Bro, I tell you yes, I know, that is, I know she’s been with someone. - I would know, I'm telling you. - Think about it, I know she's been with someone! - And you've been with her for 10 years... - With me-- Mi--quel! Miquel. Mi-Miquel? Which Miquel? Miquel, the one who went to school with her. No. Yes. El Big Mac? Yeah, that one. But... But don't... You’re telling me she's sleeping with the Fat Bastard. - But he's not "fat" anymore... - What do you mean he's not "fat"? - He was such a "fat bastard". - He's not anymore. Now he’s, a dude, dude, a..., well, he’s all good, now. - Really? - I swear to you. - What do you mean "he's all good"? - That now he's not... that he's... Well, you've seen him. Did you like what you saw? - No, man, no! - Then what do you mean, he's all good? You say things, sometimes, that fuck me up... No! He's a good-looking person, okay? Okay! And why hadn't you told me that? He's playing chicken with us, the huge son of a bitch. Yeah. And... what if he's telling the truth? Angela, I don't have it, believe me! He does! Yeah, but he's willing to go to the exchange. - Because he's an idiot. - This is true. Yes. - Okay, okay. I'm sorry, I have to. - Angela, he has it, eh! - Fine, shut up! - Are you coming or what? Let's go! What's wrong with you now? Nothing's wrong with him. Right? Come on, let's go! No, no, no, leave it, go! Hmmm! What a pair of... (bird: caws) Bollocks! What time is it? He should already be here. Great. - Criminals late for their appointment. - Yes... You got it on with the Big Mac, with that fatso! What? - Don’t play dumb, I know everything. - You do? - Yes. - Everything? Everything? No, not everything. - In fact, he only knows that. - B-but... but he was a loser! So, then you know he's a policeman now. - A policeman? - Yes. - A snitch, then. - Ah! - But so are you serious or what? - Why are you asking? We're not even together anymore. Also, I don’t have to explain my life or anything else to you! Or haven't you "got it on"? - She and I haven't done anything, okay? - Seriously!? - Well, not anything serious. - The gall! Plus, I noticed her from day one, I said, "please, don't fall in love with me". - Ah! Shut up, already, you son of a bitch! - “Son of a bitch,” she says. Yes, yes, with the Big Mac, or maybe not anymore... Enough, enough, enough already, eh! That him? Yes. Yes. Let's get out. No, no, no, you stay here, let him go. - Me? Me? Why me? - Because it's all your fault. But listen, what if he recognizes me? You think he'll recognize you with that thing on your face? - But under it I'm still... - Go, go! - Well, okay, go, go. I'm going. - Great. - Pass me Teresa's gun. - I left it at home. What? You don't have a gun? No! No, no, no, no, we've never needed a gun before, okay! Go! Go, you'll see! - Wow, bro! - I'm going! - Va! - Quiet! Bollocks. Well? You getting out or what? Okay, okay, okay, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going! Ah! - Be cool, huh? - The coolest. Give me my sister. Give me the ring first. Manu? What? No, no, no, it's not me. I can recognize your voice perfectly. - Sons of... - What did you think? - So he was right. - Shit, he'll remind me the rest of my life. You're wearing the same shirt from the last day we saw each other, you slob! - I shit all over everything, I already told them... - You bastard! I knew it was you. If you knew, why didn’t you say anything? Because I wasn’t 100% sure. - Then you didn't know. - I knew it. - He had no idea it was me. - It doesn't matter, god! - You didn't know! - The fucking rage you've always made me feel! - You? Are you OK? - I could be better. She's fine, as always. The ring? Is it in the box? Let her go and I’ll give it to you. No, no, give it to me and I'll let her go. No, 'cause I know you won't let her go when I give it to you. And how do I know you'll give it to me if I let her go? All right, let's walk towards each other. Perfect. - You first. - No, you first. - You first, it was your idea. - Who gave birth to him. - Go! - Quiet. It's your turn. (Angela) What the fuck are they doing? - Hey, hey, longer steps! - I do them like you do them. - Ugh, what the fuck are they doing? - All right, look! Now you! - You wanna do me a favor and... - Teresa! We're working. Yeah, working, bollocks, working. Oh wait, shit, I just took two steps, you take two now. - It's just that I don't understand... - Wait. - Don't try me, huh? - No, two! Now. - (Nil) Now you! - (Manu) Come on. - Until one day. - Yes. Surprise! He showed up... the little I-don't-know-what! Did you like the story? At any rate, here it ends. Beautiful, beautiful, my little angel, it's a very beautiful story, very. It-- It's... I'm a little baffled. Raül..., I'm pregnant. We'll be parents, Raül. Ukh, ukh... What's going on? Come on, man, it's a happy night. What's wrong with you now? I-- I can't breathe. What do you mean you can't breathe? Don't scare me, okay, please. - “Fan yourself” with that. - But, but-- I'm beside myself... Oh, you...commit..., darling. Yes, yes, I... I can't breathe. What's wrong? Come on, don't be scared... Man, I was happy! I'm beside myself. How-how-how, how... how has this happened? How has this happened? Alas, I don't know, we've had "intercourse" so many times. I've been thinking about it, but I'm not sure when it "curdled". - I don’t know, but that's the least of it. - Pregnant? It's unbelievable. Yes, darling, pregnant. Aren't you-- aren't you-- aren't you happy? Yes, yes, pregnant! Yes. It's unbelievable. Ah! That's the danger when you go with young women. Well, then, what? Will you stay with me? Naturally, the sun rises every day. What? The sun rises every day? Can you tell me yes or no? Don't make me nervous! - Of course I do, my love. - Yes or no? I stay or I don't stay. - I will stay with you, of course. - Well that's it! - And with Raulito, too? - How's that? Raulito. Come here, dummy, come on. Daddy, cool daddy. - You didn't expect that. - No. You said: "It's impossible, I won't be able to." Well look at me now! Come here. Oh, my cool daddy, cool daddy You'll see your mama. Ugh! (Teresa) "Fuck"! Go! Give her to me. - Give me the ring. - No. Give her to me. - No, no, no. - Let her go and I'll give it to you. - What is she doing here? - Shit! Now we're in deep shit. (bird: caws) (bird: caws) Let her go! Let me go! Mom, really... all this... Ah! I'm warning you! Manu has the ring. He doesn’t have it, look where we are. Do you think he would be so stupid, as to endanger his family if he had the ring? He would be the dumbest person in the world. He is, Mom. Believe me, he really has it. I had the real Blue Dream in my hands, but he stole it from me and exchanged it for a fake one. Assume, Teresa, that you were wrong, it wasn’t the original. Thank you so much, Mom, all I want is for this to end, I want to go back with my family and... Oh! That hurt. Maybe you don't have the Blue Dream, but I can't let it pass that you kidnapped my daughter. No, no, we just kidnapped her in self-defense. - We won't tell anyone about it. - I already know that. Box them up. Uh... Go on. As a kid, to solve it, I took off the stickers. It’s a matter of applying a little bit of logic. I don’t know, either, but when I do it I don’t think about anything else. Come on, calm down, I'm sure it's okay, you'll see. They should already be here. You know what? (sighs) I told my mother that .., that if she wants to have the creature, that's fine with me. Well... that's good. Yes, well, if one day she makes a mistake and puts the chicken in the crib. and the boy in the oven, it will be a little your fault, but hey. Don't worry, your mother does very well raising children. # ("Empty Spaces", Marion Harper) # "Fuck", come here, come here! # Hold me close, baby. # Cause you won't get... lost in the lonenly night. # Listen to me, one-one thing... sorry, eh, but one question, but... if we voted again now, you'd vote differently, right? Fran, don't start. No, it's not a big deal, but I want to know, you can be honest. Would you vote against my father again? Pff! I knew it... - But... - I knew it! Fran, I don't trust this guy. Turns out, "this guy" is my dad. Clearly you have no idea how important this is to me. It can be just as important as you want, but in the end it’s my decision, right? If I'm not cool with your father, I'm not cool, period? Well, very well, that's it. Well, that's it. # When things get rough # Count on me I'll try. # To make time... # That's it? Seriously? I come here to make peace, so that you see your opinion matters to me, and now it's finished? You know what? You're full of shit! # ...cause you're the reason why # I fill my empty spaces. # Stop, stop, stop now, please! Please, please, stop, stop! Manu, tell her, please, please, I beg you! It's just that this lady is "crazy"! They'll throw us into the sea! - Oh, don’t say that, please! - Well, you've seen what she's made of. Pfff... I'm sorry, Angela, but they need to know. What? Angela is pregnant by a cop! If you hurt her, you better be ready! - A cop... - What did you say! Jesus, let's take a moment here, by a cop? No. One moment, one moment. Are you pregnant? You didn't know either, did you? Well, now you know. One moment, ah, oh, ah, you got pregnant... with fucking Miquel? Are you both crazy or what? - I'm not pregnant! - Oh, no? You're not pregnant, huh? - And what is this? - Not mine. I found it in the toilet, the one you go to so often. Ugh... Well then, whose is this? From Alex? Fran, Alex... Oh, no, no, no, that's impossible, Alex takes the pill. So who's pregnant?! Victoria? - Yeah, sure, impossible! - Impossible! - (woman) Angela! - What? Teresa told me you have 3 children. - We do! - You have nothing, I have 3. They will do! One moment, no, no, but... but why? Let's go see your family. "An expressive design combined with a relaxed atmosphere", look... "Spacious kitchen block..." Jesus, how interesting can the van be? Forget the van. You know all the shit stirring out there in that house right now? The husband who returns and finds that his ex-wife is with his brother. "Wide drawers". You know all the drama that will come now? Discussions, jealousy, broken hearts, fights... Maybe even... a murder. What murder, huh, what murder! - Oh, it will be a tragedy, Peter. - The biggest of all. Ugh, and we'll be here. - Oh! Ah! - Here! - Seeing it! - What? - In the front row! - In the very front row! - Could it be even better? - Yes. What, what, what? We will approach it. Oh no! - We'll get in there! - Oh, yes, we'll get in... And we’ll get to the booooottom of this issue! Oh! I feel like I’m almost there! - Ah! - Ah, Pete! Uoh! That is passion. Decided, I'll do the scam for us and then we'll be at peace. She was right, she is pregnant. He's emotional. He's even more excited than me, I swear to you. I remind you that we're here because you lost the ring. I haven't lost anything, Manu has it. (Nile) If Manu has it, don't worry, mom is handling it. Good morning! - The screams are coming from the basement. - Aaah! What are you doing? - It says here you're at 4 weeks. - The guy was gonna come and here you come... 4 weeks since Eduardo's death. This is not over yet. Nando, you and Angela...? English subtitles by Misha Syeed OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
