 (officer) Mr. Dorado, you are under arrest for fraud. I have an idea. I propose that Raül get inside his dead cellmate's coffin. No. - You want me to pick it up for you. - Yes. How can I say no to these little eyes? - Paula is beautiful, eh? - Raulito! - What, what, what? It wasn't this one? - No, of course not! Victoria! Angela! This coffin says it was going to the mortuary school. - You changed the cards, right? - Yes.

 Well the other one had to have Leo’s name and destination. - Ah, Montjuïc cemetery. - Okay, perfect. Boo! What the hell is he doing here? Did you want to open the niche with your hands, Einstein? - And he's the smart one? That's nuts! - Can you idiots stop?! This is not the time for a dick measuring contest! Raül's life is in danger! I like cute boys, like you. But really, you? God damn... I know you have the ring, Manu! Do you think this is worth more than your family, or what? Let them remember me like... like the father I never was. - Teresa, do you want to marry me? - Yes.

 I’m happy to marry Teresa, but I want them to leave. I was wrong about you. They’re my driving gloves, they’re nice, a good brand. But I don’t have a car? Yeah, but now you have mine. If you want us to get married, you’ll have to give me an engagement ring. It was you. You convinced Dad to sacrifice himself for us. He always had the ring. Guys, come here, come here! - What? - Look. - What's up? - It's this one. But how could he possibly have escaped? May I present to you, the magician Raül Dorado, escape artist and lawyer. You plan to run away? - To where? - As far away as possible. I called Nile and he's preparing the false documentation for us, as soon as we have it we'll leave the country. "We'll leave"? Who-who's we? Well, when I was younger, I used to take Dramamine so as not to get dizzy. Mom, what about me? What am I gonna do? You just going to leave me lying here like a dog? It's just... No, dummy, you'll come too. Say what? Yeah, you said you were fed up with this house... and that you wanted to see the world and who knows what else, so, then, wouldn't you like a trip to Bali? Ladybug, my love, I don't think it can be Bali. Uh, no, I'm not planning to flee anywhere. In fact, it's better that way, my love. The thing is, our escape is turning out a little more expensive than I had anticipated. In fact, in fact, I think maybe... we should sell Victoria’s lot. Fine, I have plenty of shit, obviously, if you want to sell a lot of it, take it, I don’t care. No, not a lot, the lot, I'm talking about... The house? No, no, you can't sell it, Victoria. No, no, you're right, the house is not for sale. After all we've been through, don't worry, we won't sell it. Thank you, Victoria. Now, of course, we can't turn our backs on Raül either, remember he's in this fucking "mess" because of us, because he saved us! Therefore, between us, we'll have to collect the money and until then, lay low. Period. OK? Simply put, nothings happening. - "Simply put..." - (doorbell) Nile told me he wouldn't come until noon. Alex, go with Raül to the garage; Nando, you're with me. Victoria, you, you, you... hide. Ah, okay. # (whistling) # - Stay calm, okay? Stay calm, everything will be fine. - Yes. - We know nothing. - Right. (panting) Maaaanu! - Again? - Manu, I know you're here! Manu, get out here right now! Hey, look, "make the fleece in your closet jealous." Can you tell me why you're here, Teresa? You know perfectly well why I'm here, Nando. Where is he? He only got an hour headstart. Where are you hiding him? He's in the freezer, right? Yes, yes, obviously he's in the freezer. Hey, "pussy," I still don't like you. And you, you stay 10 feet behind me this time. Manu! Manu, get out here right now... so I can kill you with my bare hands! Teresa, wait. Teresa! Teresa, wait a moment! Where are you going? Raül Dorado, the best lawyer, can I help you? What the fuck is going on here? Where's Manu? No, don’t tell me he's already taken the car? Which car? Teresa, really, we don't know what you're talking about. He's really not here? No, Teresa! And what are you doing here, dressed like that? Your brother left me flat on the altar and took the ring. It's funny, you know what this "garage" atmosphere reminds me of? That movie, what was it called? "Return to the future", "Back from the future". Don't touch anything, okay, it said if you touch something you change the future and... - Well, okay, Victoria, please. - Fine. We're back to this, Teresa? Again? - Manu didn't have the ring. - (Teresa) Yes, he did. That’s why I agreed to marry him, because he returned it to me. Lady, you're nuts, I mean you're just doing all this 'cause you're butthurt... that he didn’t want to marry you, obviously. Butthurt my ass. Angela, you know Manu, you know he always had it. But he's changed. I was wrong, he protected all of us. Oh, yeah, a massive change. Isn't that right, Nando? Well, Ma-Manu is... Manu is a hero, and if it weren't for him we... we wouldn't be here, right? You see? And he would know... No, Mom, Dad did have the ring. But what-what are you saying, Fran? Yes, Mom, Manu deceived us all from the beginning. The real hero here is Nando, who convinced him... to give the ring to Teresa in exchange for our freedom. Is that true? "You see?" I always knew, I just didn’t want to break your excitement. What a bastard, what a son of a bitch, it's just that... Today was the wedding day, okay, and my father made me give the ring to Manu before the wedding because he was so excited to give it to me during the ceremony... You can stop there, Teresa, we already know where you're going. (Teresa) It's just the huge bastard... I only lost sight of him for 30 seconds, I swear to you. Stop, stop, stop a moment. Uh... so, if Manu ran away, why didn't your father publish the confession? I don't get anything out of sending you to jail. I took it and I won’t make it public. But, in return, you have to help me get the ring back. And I’ll give you half of what I get out of it, and that’s a lot of money. We're listening. No, no, we're not listening, we're not listening to you. We can't get involved in another fucking mess. I can't anymore, enough. No! Mom, Dad tricked us all, and he betrayed us. Again. I don't think we can let him get away with it. (David) I'm with Fran. We need the money, right? (sighs) How are you so sure he'll come? Where is... his car? (sighs) Again. Where did you put it? - What-what is all this? - It's your ticket out of here. Nile prepares this when someone joins our organization, in case things go wrong. That means he gave me the car not so I could have it, but so someone would keep it here while he looked for a way to escape. I'm afraid so. He's no good, not in the slightest. I certify that all these passports are fake, all of them. If he wants to flee the country with the ring, he'll have to pick this all up and then we'll have him. Great, and how do we do it? What's the plan? # # WELCOME TO THE FAMILY You should have told us that he had the ring. Manu didn't deserve you covering for him, Nando. I don't know, I guess I wanted you to have a good memory of him. Oh, but yes, the fault is mine, mine for trusting him again. He's the same miserable, the same fake, hypocritical... He's a shitty person. You’ll have to hide that a bit if you want the plan to go well. Yes, yes. (clears her throat) Let's see, Fran and David have already taken the car, and the others are at Eduardo's. - Any doubts? - No. Remember that he's got the ring on him and that he'll try to deceive and confuse you like he did the first time, don't believe a word he says. I’d love to see how he explains it all this time. He thinks Nando is the only one who knows he had the ring, therefore, he'll surely play the hero. - What if you're wrong and he doesn't come? - No, believe me, he'll come, I know him well. So if what you say is true, why would he come here and put himself in danger? He's not that foolish. (Manu) Family, good news! I'm back! What did I tell you? Okay, you know what to do! Yes, yes, yes. You stay calm. We get the ring back, then I'll help you strangle him, if you want. - Okay, okay, okay, yeah. - Here goes. Surprise! "Bro"? Oh, how much I wanted to come back and see you again! Although I'm sure not as much as you wanted to see me, right? - But, how-how-how... - Come here, come here, come here! Let's see if you can pay for the taxi, I didn't have change. Yes, yes. Angela. Manu. Uh... The kids? They're not there. And what are you doing here? Wow, I was expecting a warmer welcome. I managed to escape, me, your hero. Yes, I see that, but... how? Huh? And the dad? And the recording? No, don't worry, don't worry, I negotiated with the dad, well, it cost me 19 Pictiomovie games, but in the end I won. You should have seen the drawing I made of "The Bridges of Madison County," spectacular. He had no choice but to destroy the "pendrive" in front of me. Then, without the recording, I just had to find the right time to run away. Which was? The wedding. Ah. And Teresa? Hm, she was collateral damage. Poor thing, she was very hung up on me. I wouldn’t be surprised if she came here saying nonsense. She-she didn't come, did she? - No. - Here? No, no, no. I don’t think she’s really looking forward to seeing us again. Eh, are-aren't you happy that-that I saved you, that it's all over, eh? Yes, man. Yes, yes, it's great. Yes, it's just that when... It's all been very unexpected, "bro". And, I don’t know, I think we’re still a little bit, like, in shock, right? Yes, yes, yes. Thank you very much, Manu. You're welcome. That's what family's for... So then, let's celebrate! Come on! Yes, let's celebrate that Manu is a free man, yeah. Well, it's not all good news. I can't stay long because the dad said... But now we want to know everything, huh, and in detail. But there is not much else to explain. - No? - No. And the kids, will they be back soon? Because I should get a move on. - No. Sara is in drum class. - Yeah. And Fran and David have gone for a ride in your car. In-in my car? Of course, that’s why it wasn’t there. Uh, and Fran? He's doing okay, right? Fran? Perfect. After what you did, he won’t stop talking about you. Yeah. A-a-and is my car okay too? Your car is spotless. Your car... He wipes it with a damp cloth every day. Oh, what a pity you have to leave, huh, because they would be very excited to see you, but if you have to go... Well, look, I can stay for a while. - Oh. - They won't be long, will they? - No, no. - A glass. - Great. - Okay. Right! For my "bro", our hero, our protector... Wow! - Hey, "bro", what the fuck? - Sorry, "bro." Hey, Nando... Take it off, take it off, I'll wash it for you. No, doesn't matter, doesn't matter, it's already drying on its own. Why don’t you shower while I make something for you to eat? Huh? You already look very tired from the trip, go on. - Yes, I caught whiff, and oof... - No, really, I don't want to be a bother... It's no problem, please! With everything you've done for us... Come on, take it off. - And we can spend some time while the kids come. - Exactly, go. Okay. Uh, Nando, you can come with me. - Totally, he'll go with you. - Yes, of course, man. Go on, go, go, go. Did you tell them anything about the ring? - I notice Angela's a little weird. - No, a pact is a pact. By the way, do you have it on you? No, no, I left it with Teresa, something had to be sacrificed. Come on, man, "bro," you know you can tell me everything, right? I'm not lying. You think I'd lie to you at this point? I had to decide between you and the ring, and if I have learned anything from you it's that family, family comes first. Yes, yes, man. In that case I'm very proud of you, brother. And you have reason to be. And also, apart from that, thanks to you. - Hey, don't forget. - Yes. - Thanks to you. - Mm-hm. Pst! Come here. Come. Listen, and don't worry, I won't bother you anymore, I will leave as fast as I have arrived. Just so you know, I will never stand between you and Angela. Come on, cool it, man, this is your house. Hm? Yes. Ah! Ah! Come on, woman, if you come with us, you can change your name, and pick one that's a little hornier. What do you think of Anna Tomy? Get it? Anatomy of the human body, "Anna" is the first name and "Tomy" is the last name. I got it. But I don’t want to change my name, I like the one I have. Fiiiiine. Oh, daughter... Why don't you come, woman? You know what? We'll be tourists. Come on, it'll be an adventure. It's all set, we're going to see the Eiffel Tower. What do you think? Didn't you want to go to Bali? Oh, yes, but we can make a stop, right? We won't go directly. - I don't know what to tell you... - Mom, it's not a vacation, okay. Look how stubborn you're getting, daughter, don't you see that you can't stay here alone? And don’t you see that I’m 20 and yes I can? Oh, 20, already? Well, you'll have to lie, now that I think about it, because I told Nile to say in my passport that I'm 85, and those might not fit togehter. - Are you listening to what I’m telling you or what? - Brrf... Honey, can't you see she doesn't want to come, so don't come, we'll send you a postcard. No. No, Raül, not without my daughter, period. Alex and I have been together all our lives and we took care of each other. Honey, I do know this is very sudden, my darling, but sometimes life has these spurts, she goes crazy, she gets "playful." I said no. No! Okay? I can't believe you'd do this to me. I can't believe it, darling. Me? You're the one who decided without telling me anything. So nuts... "Fuck," I don't want to be separated from you either, Mom, but what do I do? That's not what really hurts. Look, wanting to separate from me is a law of nature, I could understand that, if you were leaving me, but to leave your little brother, my dear. Think of Raulito... Do you want this baby to grow up an orphan? Mom, an orphan is when the parents are missing. For a while, I've been a right fool, really far down that path, I was born a fool and I will die a fool. You know what I had imagined? Huh? That we would form a happy family of four, look, like the drawing the boy made... What drawing? A family of "four", don't tell me that... Would you believe it, a baby...? Look at what he drew. (laughs) Mom, how could he have made a drawing if he hasn’t been born yet? Yeah, I thought that too, but... Wow, I mean really. (sniffles) Look... Mom... maybe... (motorcycle: approaching) It's Nile. Listen, we were told we couldn’t go out, okay. We can't let Manu see him either, can we? I'm going to get the passports. Oh, daughter, you always have such a temper. (door: closes) - Alex, I've got the passports ready. - Why didn't you tell me anything? About what? Listen, do you want to see yours? Take a look at the name. You're all so dense! I didn’t say at any point that I wanted to leave. - But Raül told me... - Yeah, but I didn't tell him anything. Oh, hold on a sec, you mean you're not leaving? I don't know, I don't know, okay? Will you leave me alone? Hold on a moment. I have a few minutes, do you want to go for a walk? No, no, thank you, anyway... in case you don't remember I still think you're a dickhead and I want nothing to do with you. Alex, I- I am leaving. What? I... I got a passport and I leave early tomorrow. What? I said that when it was all over I would go away, and that’s it, it’s over. No, no, well, don't be so sure. Your sister and Manu are inside. Yeah, and they're still on about the ring. Exactly, if I stay I'll end up like them. Come on, can we talk for 10 minutes? I wouldn’t want us to end things angry. Anyway, we may not see each other again. (shower: water running) (shower: water running) (shower: stops) Shit on a whore... - Oh... - Come on, dude. Can't you look where you're going, dude?! What-what happened? Are you ok? - Us, yes. - W-What does that mean? Well, Fran was driving slower than a turtle and... No, it was- it was a 15mph road... I told him you drive these cars fast or you don't drive them, because that's how it is, look at this car. So absolutely, I told him to go a little faster. Yes, and he grabbed the steering wheel and pushed my leg... Likely story! He got confused with the pedals, I swear to you. - They do put them very close. - But what happened? What is this? We... we had an accident. Oh, please, a little "caution", I mean they're telling you constantly. - What kind of accident? - Uh... - We... - What?! We ran over someone. - What?! - Mama mia - A hit and run? - My specialty. Did you check if the body was still moving? No, no, he didn't move, and we didn't know what to do, and then... Breathe, Fran, calm down, breathe. Take it, take it, take your Ventolin, go on. Take it, go on. Bravo! Yes, gentlemen, very good, very good job. Congratulations, nice try. I must say you've covered all the details, smoke, dent, even the blood looks real. It even... it even tastes like... blood, yes, yes. Nice job. But there is one thing that you forgot. Fran, you can't lie. It’s very clear what’s going on here, I know you deliberately messed up my clothes. Someone told you I have the ring and you want to get it back. Manu, I swear to you, I swear to you by my children... Mom! Enough, okay. Dad, it's true, yes. We had set a trap for you because we knew that Teresa... - Shut up! They'll catch us! - What does it matter, let's get caught!  - Okay, is-is, is Teresa here? - (Nando) No. Yes, yes, yes, yes she is here, Teresa! Teresa! How did you fuck this up? You've shit all over the plan. What plan? What did you want to do to me? After what I've done for you? But aren't you listening to me? I killed a person. - No way, Fran. - Yes! The plan was to take the car, which is where you keep your fake passports, but I wasn't supposed to run over anyone. So if we go back to the site of the accident, there will be a corpse, right? - Uh... - Mmm... No. How's that? You killed him, but only a little, right? He walked away afterwards. What is that? What do you think, dude? We told you we didn’t know what to do. No, no, wait, wait... Sure, you hired the typical supporting actor to play the small role, right? Grandpa, grandpa, you can stop acting ridiculous! - He, he... - Leave him alone, "fuck," he's dead. Leave it! Mylaf Danses Alohn, seriously? What kind of a shitty name is that? - Your mother chose it. - Obviously. - What the fuck, dude. - It's not that bad. Anyway, you're very pretty in the photo, and you look like a Mylaf. Ha, ha, very funny. It's just that I find it surreal, you know, I have to decide between leaving my family or being a fugitive the rest of my life. - Yeah, yeah. You're telling me. - Well you seem pretty calm. - Because I've got nothing holding me here. - No, neither do I. No? No. No, Fran and I are done. It bugs me to say it, but... I think you should forgive him. No, I've already forgiven Fran. It's just that we've tried it in every way possible and it doesn't work, then, I don't know, maybe it's time... that we accept that we're not made for each other, and that’s it. And what about me? Do you forgive me? Why is it so important, all of a sudden, that I forgive you? Huh? - I mean you're leaving, right? I'll never see you again. - I don't know, I care. - Do you see that car? - Yes. Well there's a couple fucking inside. Oh yeah? How do you know? Because you took me to the "riding school" of Les Pungoles, dude. - Did I take you to the "riding school"? - Yes, yes, yes. Most people lost their virginity among these trees. Bravo. You too? Man, and how! At 16. With John, "aka the Pony." - "The Pony"? - Yes, yes, he was well endowed. Want to play a game? Come on, truth or dare? - Are we 15 years old now? - Pony loved it. The Pony, he loved it... Truth or dare? I choose truth. Great. Um... Did you really like me, or was this all just part of some macho plan? A competition to humiliate Fran and that's all? I liked you, truly. From the first moment I saw you. In fact, I still like you, a lot. Why? No, that's another question. No, no, no, that’s the second part of the question. Come on. All right, I'll buy that. Well, I like you because I like you. Um... Because I have a better time with you than with anyone else. I feel like I connect with you. And I'd say, maybe I'm wrong, but I'd say that it's something similar for you. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Ah, I see. I'm not sure, it's more like you were kind of a cheap romantic comedy, you know, and I missed it a bit, but in a good way. Am I wrong or not? Wait your turn to ask questions, okay? So far, counting the involuntary manslaughter and the omission of aid, he could get up to 8 years. - How many? - Yes. And you too, for being an accomplice. And that's not taking into account that they tried to hide the corpse. Obstruction of justice, two more years. Stay calm, guys. Stay calm, don't panic,  we'll find another solution. Absolutely, no one here will go to jail. If there are no witnesses, there is no crime. True, we can get rid of the body, like you did with your grandfather. Hey, what are you still doing here? I’m not going anywhere until you give me back what’s mine. Look, Teresa, it's clear he doesn't have the ring, because we looked for it and he doesn't have it, therefore, you must be doing all this out of revenge or... Yes, yes, yes, it is very clear that you are very hung up on Manu, and you don't even know it. Yes, totally. I'm sorry, Dad, we shouldn't have distrusted you. Don't worry, son, I forgive you. Wow, it looks like you've been left alone. Alone, and... without a "pendrive". Ha, ha! Boom! Fuck you! Anyway I knew you wouldn't have the balls to use it. Re-really, I-I was sure. Yeah. This shit again. (Raül) Hold on a moment, family, this whole conversation is great, but we must return to the subject of the death. The death. It is very important to know if anyone has seen you. No. No. I'm sure, no one saw us. Are you positive? (door: knock) - Remember I'm not here. - Me neither. (knock) Let's go! Come on, come with me. (knock) - Hi. - Hi. - Can we help you? - Yes. Is this yellow car parked out here yours? Ugh..., again, look, I told Peter he can't park here. - Who is Peter? - Peter is the... Peter. - Our neighbor who is, is... - Yes. - Oh, yeah. - Where are you going? And your neighbor lives with you? I've seen that guy who's hiding and another much more handsome one, they ran over a grampa, put him in the trunk of their car... and they went running from the scene of the crime. Wh-what are you saying? Do you have something to prove this madness? Yes. This. - Gimmie that for a second... - No fucking way. I think I'll call the police right now. Look, wait a moment, one moment. Let's see, one number, another number... Dad, do something. Ohhh, there's only one number left. Okay, okay, okay. I'm sure we can... we can find a solution before going to court. Oh. What do you mean? - Truth or dare? - Dare. Bastard. Dare... Go to that car and ask them if they're lost. - No. - Yes. No fucking way. If you don’t, we’ll have to get to the truth. Okay, okay, fine. "Go". Hello, hello, hello. Lower the window a little... Nothing, nothing, I was just worried you were lost, since you've been here for a while... No, no, no, no, we were trying to have an intimate moment. Oh, oh, oh, Nil! Nil, get over here, guess what... They were doing things! Okay, let's go, let's go. Listen, this is a family-friendly park, really, huh! You know, youth ain't what it used to be, I wouldn't want to have to call the police! Well. What? Huh? - I didn't ask for all that. - Yeah, I went a little big. Yeah, no kidding. You reminded me of your mother. Oof. - You see what I'm saying? - What? We have a fucking great time when we're together. # So hard to find someone who cares. (dog: distant barking) # So hard to find someone who dares. # And tell you straight ahead that he won't break your heart. # So hard to find... # It's your turn. - Oh, yeah. - Truth or dare? # Those empty spaces... # Truth. #...you left behind. # Would you ask me to go with you? Do you want me to ask you? No, that's a question, not an answer. No, it's a question that answers your question. Ugh, it doesn't matter, I'm losing it. Truth or dare? Dare. Leave with me. #...I resigned. # Now I've realized... # that I've survived. # Okay. Okay. # Very well, name a figure. Okay. I want 100,000 euros or I'll go to the police. What did you say? I mean, I mean, each. 200,000 in total. Look, are you crazy? We don’t have that kind of money. Yeah, but what I saw was pretty serious. Wait, could you give us a two for one? It’s just that I find it super unfair to accuse David when he wasn’t even driving. - But, Dad. - I'm negotiating. No, 200,000 for both. Here's what we'll do, we'll give you 10,000 and you testify. Of course, you have to say that the old man crossed without looking. What are you saying, Manu? That's a very clear mitigating factor, with no priors and with good conduct... they'll come out of prison in no time; it'll be like joining the military, okay? Are you crazy? Do you know what they do to guys like Fran in there? I will not allow my children to spend a single day in prison! Very well, then, you tell me where we get the money from. Perfect. Well 210,000 is price at closing. But didn't you say 200,000? You said you were adding 10,000 more. No! No, no, I said 10,000 instead of 200,000. Ah, ah. No, no, no, well no, no. 200,000. Right? Are you asking me? Ugh, look, I don't know, it's my final offer, okay? I'll give you 10 minutes to think about it and if not, I swear I will call the police. But where is she going? Uh, I'm gonna go keep an eye on her. In any case, see you. But-but what a shitty negotiation that was! Dad, what do we do? Do you have a plan or not? Look... I know that what I'm going to tell you may shock you a little, but listen to me before you judge me. - No. - No, go on. - Tell us, tell us. - Shoot. This chick is an amateur, if I grab her by the head, you guys get her feet, we tie her up and... Are you crazy or what, Manu? - What, it worked with Teresa! - You think this is "worked"? For the love of God, don't say nonsense! We are playing with the future of our children, Jesus! There must be another option, “bro,” think. Of course, why didn't I think of it before? Yes, man, we sell the house. - No. - No. - No, no. - Not the house, we can't. Why? Because... Because there's the inheritance clause. Of course. It says we can’t touch the property for a 10-year period. It’s — it’s very common, uh, in wills, that clause. Well, I can't think of anything else. No, we're in a lot of shit, huh. Uh..., and-and no... - No, no. -No. Hey, Manu, can we talk for a moment, you and me? Yeah. What's going on? You also don't think it's a good idea to kidnap her and... - It's a shitty idea, Manu. - Well then, what do you propose? I was thinking about the ring. Bollocks, of course, I've been dreading this for a while. I thought I would think of another option, but there isn't one. No. I don't think there is. And how do we do it? It won't be easy to take it from Teresa, she must have left it at the embassy. - Manu, I know you have it! - What are you saying! You believe Teresa more than me, but you don't see that she does all this... Shut up, Manu, that's enough! I’ve had it up to my balls with your nonsense and shitty lies. You'd send the family to jail! Do you think that because I'm with Angela now, she's no longer your family? Are you crazy or what's wrong with you? Family does not mean being related to someone and living with them, that's not necessary, it's not necessary. Having a family, Manu, means setting an example! Jesus! Being there, and you are not there. Yeah. And now you're telling me you don’t have the ring, but I won't take any more bollocks to show that I trust you and let you go. But if you have it, and you do have it, then you still have time to prove that you are a hero, Manu. And this time for real. But if I don't... Manu, I won't ask you again. Do you have it or not? Look... (sniffs) in the hypothetical case that I... - What the fuck! - I don't know, Jesus! Even if I had it, it wouldn’t be quick to sell it. Well, this chick doesn’t think we have 200,000 bucks under the mattress. - She can wait. - But Teresa won't let me... She's still on the wanted list, we can get rid of her with a quick phone call. And Angela and the children? I don't know, we'll think of some excuse. We have time. Okay. Great. Give it to me. It's not that easy. Do you have any laxatives? How's it going, "bro"? - (Manu: straining) Gooooood... - Okay. (Manu: straining) How's it going, "bro"? (Manu) Look, if you ask me every two seconds, I'll never finish. Okay, okay, sorry, I just want to help, okay. (Manu) Explain to me how you can help me with this. Okay, I’ll go tell them you got nervous and now you've got the shits. (Manu) No, no, don't say that. Look, you better say I'm thinking of a plan. Or no, no, tell them, uh... Nando, tell them... Nan... Nando? Well, do you have the ring? No. He's, uh... - He... - And now he has to... - Really? - Yeah, still... What, what, what, you mean-you mean he's...? Yes, and he still has to shit it out. - Oh, stop, stop, stop. - Well, calm down, honey, no... And then he’ll have to grab it from the toilet, of course. - What? - What do you mean "what"? - Did I do it right? I was super nervous. - Are you fucking kidding me? I knew it was a troll, and even I hesitated. I was like "what the fuck". You say that because you see me with good eyes. - Always, my love. Paula, I... - "Oh my God." You are... you are mine... (David) I want to do it. (Paula) Oh, wait, wait. "I promise... Oh my God." (David) "Powerful"... "Yeah"... - (Teresa) Is Manu in the car? - Yes. - (Teresa) He's escaping! - (Raül) We have to stop him! Where do you think you're going?! Get out of this car right now! - Your mother! - I told you to get out! Aaah! Come here, you son of a bitch! Give me back the ring! Give it back to me, now! I swallowed the ring. If you want it, you'll have to kill me! That's my plan! Jesus! - The ring! - What? The ring! He has it, the "lawyer"! Come here, you rat! Give it to me! Aah! Give me the ring! - Let me go! Let me go! - Ah! Freeze! No one move! Well, well, not only is it Raül Dorado, we also have Teresa Díaz here, two for one. And I guess this is the famous Blue Dream. Detain them all and start recording evidence. Can someone tell me...? Ayla? I knew you were involved in the Dorado escape, but this... You're up to your ears in shit. Inspector Novell, there's a dead man here. Or maybe even higher. We caught these two out here with fake passports. This is Nile Diaz, Teresa's brother. Who the hell are you people? HQ, prepare the interrogation room for me, these people have a few things to explain. # ("I am done making fun of myself", Pajaro Sunrise) # If anyone has a plan to get us out of this, now would be a good time to share it. # I am done... # No? No one? #...making fun of myself. # On the first day of september... # (Ayla) Look ahead and hold the sign straight. # To the birds on the roofs and the drunkards walking loose. # I am done... # We'll confess everything from the beginning. I don’t understand the strategy. There is no strategy, it's over. (Ayla) Turn right. (Nando) Are you sure? Enough secrets, lies, pretending to be who we are not, we are just a normal family. (Ayla) Turn left. # I am done making fun of myself. # We'll explain everything. And whatever happens happens. (Ayla) Look ahead. # I am done making fun of myself. # Perfect. You’re a disaster of a family. But maybe you can still save yourself. - What do you mean? - Stay alert. The time has come to cancel the operation. - What do you mean? Cancel? - Do you understand what I'm telling you? Sometimes. You should know I don’t plan to take my eyes off you. Tell me everything will be fine, please. We have a problem. This place is full of undercover cops. - Listen, let's get the fuck out. - Do you really mean it? Arriiiiba, les Pungoles, arriiiiba! Are we separating forever? Will we never see each other again or what? - I don't know if I love you, anymore. - Mm? Why is this happening to me? Code red, code red! Oh, I think I broke a finger! Fucking hit it, Sareta! - Sara! - We're lost! We're going to prison, we're going to prison! Freeze! You've shit the bed now, guys. English subtitles by Misha Syeed
