 What? - (camera: shoots) - I knew it! - What the fuck are you doing?! - I-I didn't do anything, it was you. - Me?! You kissed me! I think we should take advantage of this trip to clarify our ideas a bit. - Stop! - Get out of the way! I know you have the ring, Manu! Are we like this again, after 24 years? Seriously?! - Manu! - What the fuck are you doing?! - Didn't you have a fucking dinner with Ayla? - Fuck dinner!

 - I can't let you go! - You don't understand. - Your child will need a father! - Nando, I don't want to be a father. Do you think this is worth more than your family? - If I stay, promise me something. - Of course. What? You will never tell Angela that I wanted to leave with the money. Let them remember me... like the dad... that I never was. It scares me to be a father. I never want to see you again in life. You are fired, Mr. Lawyer. I-I'm glad to marry your daughter, but... I want them to leave. (David) You know the freeezer in the garage? The last time we used it was to store my grandfather's corpse while we stole his inheritance.

 We have to prepare a very good alibi..., we have to give a fake ID to this man, the-the... the actor. Allow me to present Eduardo Navarro Gil. - This is my good side. - Yeah, but it's an ID photo. - It has to be face forward. Thanks. - Mm. We have to make him want to be part of our family. "Good morning, we are opening a disciplinary case... due to the attached photos". I don’t plan to sign anything until you tell me the truth. - We want this notary... - ...to think you're Eduardo. (Nando) "In order to change Eduardo's will in favor of his daughter Angela". My dad didn’t sign and you bumped him off to take his dough. But how did you do it? I don’t plan to stop until I see you all in jail, do you hear me? I'm dead! Oh! I can't wait to go to bed and sleep two whole weeks. Is it me or have I heard this before? - Angela, what luck that you've arrived. - Shit. What, now what? Come. Hey, Angie! We were waiting for you. - What... what is he doing here? - Well, you know what? I didn't want to miss seeing your face when you... when you hear the news. Ah... what news? Well the police say... that the ID, right?, the ID with which the will was changed just before Eduardo's death, it wasn’t authentic, that the guy in the picture is someone else. But no..., how can... how can that be? No... "How can this be, how can it be? Miss, how can it be?" I find that pathetic, how pathetic! Oh look, the trip has been worth it, mm. I guess you must imagine that..., wow, I discovered all this from the ID. It's just that I warned you, Angela. Hey, I always... Go on, man, go on, you know it. Say it with me, come on, all together. "I always..."? I always win, Angela. (Ayla) Right now we're looking for the mysterious man from the ID. Meanwhile they are all under house arrest. You can take advantage of this moment to... to say goodbye to the house, right? Because you will all end up in jail and I will keep the house. - We understand, thank you. - Mr. Navarro, you can leave now. No, no, thank you, I prefer to stay. But this is a police investigation, not a "reality". Do not believe a single word of what they say. They always do the same thing, they put on this face... the pity mask. And they are criminals. Thank you for your collaboration, we will inform you of the investiagtion. - Mm-hm. - I'll accompany you, Mr. Navarro. - Mm. - Thank you, go on. All right... come on, a little more. (door: opens and closes) - Where is Nando? - Look, what do I know. I haven't seen him since last night. Surely some unforeseen situation arose. Shit, and-and Leo? If we don’t find him before the police we are lost. Victoria, Victoria knows where to locate him. Yes, I have already called... - Raül. - Raül? Look, neither you nor Nando answered, and my mother is in prenatal class, she never takes her cell phone... because she says that the radiation will make the child will come out "weird". “The Best Lawyer” is all we've got? Can you tell me why we always end up in the hands of that waste of space?! Why?! Victoria? Victoria... Victoria? Victoria! - Victoria... - Oh! - I need you, it’s very important. - What are you doing here? - Listen to me for a moment, please. - What did I tell you? - Yes, yes, I know, but... - I told you, "Don't come back to me." - But I need your help. - I don't want to know anything about you! It's very important, listen to me for a second, please. - No, no, no. - One second. Please. I said no! "En", "o"! Oh look..., this is where they teach breastfeeding, right? In this classroom. Oh..., do I take my top off? My God..., this will be harder than I thought. # # WELCOME TO THE FAMILY Fran, how are you? Fine, and you? Listen, everything I told you, that I was with Nile, it was only because Miquel was listening and I didn’t want him to find us out. - "Okay"? - Understood. (Ayla) Bollocks! He wasn't leaving, no... What a mess, you know, what a ball buster, this Marcos! I couldn't stand it for another second. Listen, if it involves this family, you're gonna have it rough, huh? No, no, we are very loving people. Yeah, I'll be the judge of that. And what's up with you now? Uhhh... n-nothing, why? - What, what's wro...? - Shh! Are you the girl who stole Miquel's gun, the one in the photos? - No, it's not her. - What photos? - And you're the other one! - (David) Miquel's? I-I don't think so. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn (big laugh) I owe you my life! You are my guardian angels! Thanks to you, they kicked Miquel out and promoted me. Come here, come on. Alright, I'm coming. Okay. (David) You know, here for whatever. Look, let me tell you something. Right now I'm gonna call all units so they stop looking for the man in the picture, while we try to find a solution to all this about an ID. Huh? What do you think? - Well... great, isn't it? - Great. - Great! - I'm going to call. Do they not do a psychological test to be a cop? - Ha... - No, Fran, I'm serious. Today, what we're going to practice... Oh, Victoria must already know, because, of course, she's a veteran, right... right? Okay, yeah, sorry, what exactly do you mean by “veteran”? - Heck, you already had a daughter, right? - Oh yes, very much so! Well, but it doesn't matter, because I got very good at cooling off. Gosh, I haven't been drunk since! I just drink because I love it! (laughs) Well... - All right, let's continue. - Yes... Well, as I told you, today's practice will consist... of knowing how to position the baby... during the period of breastfeeding. Wow, another father cheering us on! Come in, come in! Well, who is the lucky one? Huh? No, no, no, hey, if you're not a father here, you can't stay. - No, no, I am, I'm the-the... - I don't know him. Oh, she loves to joke! It's her, yes... Go on, go on, I'll... I'll sit here. No chairs, huh? Very well, we'll sit Indian style. (doll: squeaks) Watch out! Sorry, sorry, sorry! That's it, it's the... Oh! Oh my god! Found it already, found it. He did the same with the previous baby, exactly. She's such a joker! Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. - That's it, we'll fix it right now. - Raül, please... - Raül... - There. - (all) Oh! - Same problem. We'll do it later. - (teacher) No problem. - Continue, please. - No problem, okay. Yes... - Continue with the lesson. As I was saying, the holding of the baby during the period of breastfeeding. It is held like this: one hand on the buttocks and another on the head. Victoria, would you please listen to me? I don't know if you noticed, but I'm trying to follow the class. Alex is in danger. - What did you say? - She called me. - What's going on? - They're being held in the house. Marcos has arrived with the police. They know the will was signed by an actor. If they find Leo before us, we will all go to jail. - Raulito too? Please...! - Him too, him too, yes, yes, yes. Oh, and what can we do? Alex says you have Leo's number. Yes, it's true, he gave it to me, I remember, because he said: “If you find out about any casting, let me know,” yes, yes. - We have to call him, it's urgent! - Oh, shit! He won’t answer, now, because he’s working! Working? Where? In one of those fucking scary haunted houses. I don’t know, it was something like that, what do I know. - Oh, my God... - (teacher) Did you understand? ("I've been blind", Brian Caffrey) # # If you give me your reason, don't tell me no lies. # I swear I'll dig, dig even side. # I think I see a little love left in your eyes. # Oooh, just a little, a little would be fine. # She said there's not a chance, nothing that you find, # she was broken down and left behind. # There's nothing there, so don't worry if you lie. # Oooh, if it's just a little, really it's worthwhile? # She said: "Don't waste your time". I know love can be all kind. # I should know, I should know I've been blind. # # (music: covers background conversations, unintelligible) # Hey, brighten up that face, we’re not in the slammer, right! - Oh, David! - And all thanks to you. - Hey, it’s true, what he says. - Right? - What's up, family? - Dude! - Nando! - Hey! - Where've you been? - Me? At a concert, with the Lizard. What's up, rat? You would have freaked out about the drums. What a show! And you closed it out, right? Because what a stench of alcohol! Well, you know what they say, right? “One more for the road” is never just “one more,” right? - Don't I know it! - I'm freaking out. Sara thought you would get us out of Crakòzia. Well... you're not the only one freaking out here, you know? - What are you talking about? - How about Manu? Does he kiss like you remember, or has he improved? - Adela sent a photo. - Adela? - Fuck, Adela. - So now it's Adela's fault. - Did she force you to, or how did it go? - No..., it-it was Manu, who... - It didn’t last even two seconds, okay. - Sure. - It didn’t mean anything, you know. - Not to you, but to Manu...? - Because Manu, I know that guy... - What do you have to say about Manu? Huh? What-what... what-what do you have to say, Nando? Nothing. No, let me remind you that yesterday while you were... While you were partying and getting drunk with friends, he sacrificed himself for all of us. What did you want me to do? Well, at least, for once in your life, at the very least, make it look like something matters to you! Don't talk to Nando like that! When Dad left, he was the one who stayed with us. Sara, why don’t we end this farce at once? You weren’t there, I was, and remember, no one asked him to stay. He just didn't know where else to drop dead! - Enough, Fran, please! - What are you talking about? I wish you had stayed in Crakòzia and that Dad was here! - Fran! - Where you going? - To Dad's car! - Fran! - Leave me alone, Jesus! - Okay, okay! Do you want the keys or not? Take it. It's over there. Did you drive Manu's car drunk? No... Yes. Well, I'm going. Jesus fuck...! (door: closes) # Uppers and downers, # considering a way to breathe. # # Uppers and downers, # considering a way to cry. # Won't let my food burn in the oven, # won't let my food rot in the fridge. # By... by now... Fran, aren't you going to give your father a hug? - Fran! - Come here... come on. I'm sorry, but I'm telling the truth to this poor girl. No, no! Mom, no, please. Please, I beg you please, don't-don't rat him out. For better or worse..., he's my father. I will go to the police and say it was me. I'll tell them about the theft and you'll never see me again. Thank you so much, you saved my life. The bag I'm carrying is empty, the dough is in the freezer. Your mother would never have accepted the money. Fran..., I don't have the ring. - "Okay," I believe it, I believe it. - You sure? Mom, do you want to stop distrusting Dad, please? Thanks, Fran. Fran..., I know you can do it. - What-what are you doing, what... what is this? - Here. They're my driving gloves. They’re... they’re cool, right, they’re a good brand. - But I don’t have a car. - Yeah, but now you do. You have mine. So whenever you drive it you will remember me. # ("Uppers and Downers", Coffee & Wine) # What, you giving me a ride in your new car? - Fran... - What do you want? What's is it? What's is it? Well, I think you were a little rough on Nando, no? Now you're going to give me lessons on how to treat people... you. What shit. What shit. Have you thought? About what? We said the trip would help us think about us. Have you thought about it? Have you? Yes, but it made me bleed thinking you were with Nile. It's just that I have the feeling... we don't really know each other. You know, it's like we speak different languages. Every time we have the opportunity to be together, something happens... I have a feeling you're trying to tell me you don't want to be with me, but... elegantly. No... Fran, I never try to be "elegant". Do you want to be with me? I have lost my father forever and we are about to go to jail. The last thing I want to think about is us. Can you leave, please? I need you to leave. - Please. - "Okay," yes. Hey, I'm sorry about your father. - He's here? - Yes. All right, so... we're going in, aren't we? I'm not going anywhere with you, let alone Horror in Texas, come on. All right, so, you go in, I'll wait for you out here. (man and woman: shout) - (both) Aaaah! - But... I'm not going in, these things make me “ewwy”, sorry. But, darling, they’re actors, they’re people in disguise. All right, then, I'll go in. Wait for me here. Hey, good luck! You're right, I'm scared shitless. Will you come with me? Oh, my child... I knew it. Yes, I'll come with you! Come on, let's go. Hey! No touching, Dorado. I am still angry. I know you, huh. Very well, okay. Go ahead. - Your routine has gotten old. - Yes, darling. - I'm right behind you... - Well, yes, but... - Ah..., it's well done, huh. - Very, very much so. It's so cold, isn't it? Yeah, I think it is... Ugh, these places get dirty. It’s scary, but it’s also disgusting, huh. Does it have to be so dark, too? I couldn't see three people on a donkey. - Oh! He's dead, this one. - Wait for me! Good. - (woman) Aaaah! - (both) Aaaah! Come, come, come! Come on! I know it's fake, but it is well done. - Oh, yes it’s scary, my God! - But it's fake, you know. -Yes, I know. - (both) Aaaah! Quiet, quiet, quiet, Victoria! I will not let anyone do anything to you. I won't let anyone do anything to you, Victoria. - Don't get worked up, huh? - No... Hey, be careful, huh, make no mistake. - I came here for my family. - Great. Let me be perfectly clear, Raül, that to me you're still the rat that left me pregnant, so tread very carefully, huh. Great. Great, it's been made clear, understood. Well okay. Let's keep going, already. Hey! How about a little air space! But you grabbed me, my baby! - "Baby," yes, but yours, no, huh? - Oh, my God... - Come on, let's go. - Let's go. - Where is he? Leo? Lenny? - Where is Leo? - This is a coffin, oh, my God! - It's normal, they play with death. (grunts) Oh, look at this one. Oh, she's not scary, poor thing, what a pity. Looks like she had an accident. No, she's the girl in that movie who turns her head. (deep voice) You know what she did?! Your cunting daughter?! Aaah! Jesus, what did she do, what did my daughter do? Oh, please! Don't scare me, I'm pregnant, fucker! - Did you say you're pregnant? - Yes, yes... - What is this psycho saying? - Yes, we are expecting a boy or... - Or a girl, you never know. - Yes... I'm sorry, but pregnant women are not allowed. She'll have to accompany me outside. You can go on. - Yes. - No! Eh...! Me alone? - If you want, you can go out with her. - No, wait, wait. No, no, please... why don't you let her continue with me? I’m sorry, but it’s the rules. Oh, the rules also say that actors can’t touch customers. - And you're doing that, cow. - That's true, lady! - Oh! - Yeah, get out. Go on, please. Listen to me, brat..., do you know who this woman is? - Who? - You! Oh! She is one of the most recognized actresses of her generation. One call and you will never work again in your life. Neither as Girl from Exorcist, nor Pool Girl #4! - Do you understand? Huh? - Wait, wait... You..., you didn't play the newsie's daughter in "The Newsie's Daughter"? - Of course I did! - Oh! - I was a huge fan! - Oh, yeah? I have so many fans. - It was very good. - Yes, very! But how many years ago was that? Damn, because I was in kindergarten... Not that many, eh, gorgeous. I haven’t been around for so many years, like you, eh. Oh, what a pity, girl, I don't carry a pen. I'd give you an autograph. - Oh, what bad luck. - Yeah, bad luck. - Can we continue? - Yes, yes, absolutely, I'll go back to bed. - Break a leg. - Yes, listen to me, look... - Work, work and work. - You said it. - Remember. - You bet. Those are the three keys to becoming a good actress, eh. Thanks! Listen, one thing: when you get up, don’t do it so hard. Let go, be free, free. Huh? Will you remember? - Yes, thank you! - Go on, beautiful. Goodbye, lady. Listen, what she said, about me being the best actress, was she just trying to get us to fuck off, or... what do you think? For me you are always "numero uno", my love. The "my love" thing is over, okay. Don't overdo it, Prince Charming, huh. - Victòria. Period. Okay? - Mm. Come on, come, let's go, come. (grunts) Wait, Marcos...? But when did that happen? While you were partying, "bro." Look..., I've already canceled the order, you can rest easy, angels. What... what are you doing here? - Me? - Mm-hm. Well, I live here. - You... okay, who are you? - Who-who am I? Who am I? Let's see, look at me. Who am I? Let's see, who am I, who am I? I don't know..., a policeman, right? A policewoman... policeman... I don't know. Yeah, but what do I call myself? What-what... what do I call myself? - Okay, what, what? - I guess "agent"... something. I don't know, I just can't place it, I don't know. No, Nando, it's-it's-it's Ayla, eh. We had a problem, and she has very kindly offered to fix it..., Right, Ayla? With the investigation, mm? - Ayla? - Yes. - I'm sorry, no... it doesn't sound familiar. - Incredible. - But where are you going? - That is not a good guy, okay? He hurt me a lot and he doesn't even remember it, so I'm going to re-enable the search for the ID dude. - Yes, but... - Wait, wait! I'm sure Nando would remember you, but he's very into drinking. - David. - (Sara) It's true. The poor man has become a fool, such a fool... - But Sareta, honey! - Ugh! The truth is, he does look a bit wasted, eh. - Right? Mm. - You said it, look at him. Okay, for you, and also because I promised Dr. Belmonte I would, I will count to 100 before getting carried away by anger. - Wise advice. - 100, 99... I'll be back..., 98, 97, 96, 95... - You! - Me, what about me?! - I don't know this chick at all! - You need to remember. We have a serious problem, and keeping this woman happy is the only thing that will save us. - Ayla? - Oh...! - Ayla? - Nando, Nando, Nando. You wanted to screw her thoroughly, huh. Maybe you were partying while she was risking her life for you. (David) Or maybe you ran over a relative. - (Sara) Maybe you robbed her? - Who do you think I am?! We thought you were the responsible brother. Maybe you cheated on her with another of your cuties, or on a date you made a pass at her... (snaps his fingers) Ayla is betting it all on one shot! The last second of the match, the crowd is on their feet...! Go, ghost, you'll fail for sure! - Oh yeah? - Yes. If you’re so sure, why don’t we make it a little more interesting? How do you want to play it? If I make the shot, you will do my homework for a whole month. What if you miss? I will invite you to dinner at the restaurant of your choice. Done! Go, shoot! - Jesus. - What? - I know who she is. - What...? ... three, two, one. - Who am I? - Novell. Ayla Novell. We played basketball together in the neighborhood. - And do you remember what you did to me? - Well... What I remember is that, and forgive me if I leave something out, okay, but..., I don't know, we were..., we were meeting for lunch..., no, for dinner, and I couldn't come. For three hours I was waiting in that restaurant! With an empty chair in front and a candle in the middle, humiliated! - Okay, I didn't know, I'm sorry, Ayla. - You could've sent me a WhatsApp, right? Uh, a WhatsApp? 1992: we didn't have cell phones. Well, you knew where I lived, or didn't you? Ayla, can we talk about this for a moment, you and I, please? Yes, yes, yes..., so you can run away, right? - Say what you have to say. - Tell her! But if I..., it's-it's-it's... it's just I don't know what to say to her! Tell her something, "fuck"! Uhhh... yes, oh! Okay, okay, okay, okay! My dad suddenly got sick, so I didn’t come. - What hospital? - What hospital? - What hospital was he admitted to? - To the Sacred..., Saint Joan of God. - Sacred Saint Joan of God? - It was called that before. - What was the doctor's name? - The doctor's name was... García. Fernandez. García Fernandez. You can't think of a more original last name, can you? - You're inventing it, you bastard. - No. - Look... - Okay, okay, wait, Ayla! Ayla, okay, okay, it's a lie, it's a lie! Ugh..., "okay"?, it's a lie, because-because... because I'm ashamed to tell you the truth, Jesus! Uhhh... That I... I had a foreskin surgery, and I liked you very, very much, and... and-and of course, I was weird down there, and I-I... I couldn't control myself, I-I-I... I don't know, I was ashamed to tell you the truth, do you understand? Later I regained confidence, yes, but I no longer dared! Jesus, I'm very sorry, really. I'm sorry, I'm a coward! - Mm? I'm sorry. - Is that true? It’s so pathetic, yes, but yes. Mm... - Show it to me. - Pfff! Excuse me? Undo your fly and your problems are over. - Many years have passed, Ayla. - Many years have passed, yeah. - Has it grown back or what? - I'm not going to do that, bollocks! - Do it! - Hey! Whoa, whoa! Look, one moment... Ayla, a real cop can't ask that. - Show it to me. - Ayla. - A cop can't ask for that! - What's wrong, was it another lie? Ayla, please! - No, look..., Ayla, uhh... - Shh! Shut up! Ayla, but what about the debt to the children? Oh, Angela, you are absolutely right! I am a very generous person with those who have helped me, eh. Thanks. But also very resentful of those who have screwed me. (door: opens and closes) What the fuck did you do? - Why did you lie to her again? - (Sara) You didn't lie, did you, Nando? - Yes he did, because I've seen it! - (David: laughs) - Look what you made me say. - I'm going to talk to her, okay? Jesus, it's so heavy! - (lamp: bang) - Bollocks! Oof... # Without you I can not, # without you, if you are not there, # without you I am nobody. # Without you I can not, - #... without you, if you're not there... - (Nando) Ayla. - # Without you I am nobody. - (Nando) Hey, hey! - Put that down, please. - No. I'll shoot you, I'll say you tried to attack me. # It's night, it's all dark... (Nando) I already told you I couldn't tell you the truth in front of everyone. - And why not? - #... you are with me... # 25 years ago, my brother, Manu, got Angela pregnant. And her father wanted her to have an abortion, and offered Manu money to leave. - (Ayla) And? - (Nando) And Manu accepted! He was willing to leave Angela flat, do you understand? And that’s why I couldn’t come to your dinner. Because — because I was trying to stop my brother’s escape! No matter what a dickhead he was, Manu had to side with Angela. I thought it would change over time, but look, it didn’t change. (Ayla) Couldn't you have told me that inside? Angela is very angry with you, you would have been like a hero. You see how that makes no sense? I made a promise to my brother. They have suffered enough. No need to stir up shit from the past, right? It's not necessary. "Crakòzia"? (Nando) You're a cop, aren't you? You know I'm telling you the truth. - Yes. - Are you still going to call? I’ve already done it and I don’t plan to cancel it. Just because you have an excuse doesn’t mean you stop being a dickhead. - We'll find this Leo soon. - Shit! Hey, hey, Ayla, let me go, at least, no?! - Negative! - Go to hell! - I heard you! - I don't care. (lamp: dragging) (thunder) Oh, what if..., listen..., can you imagine Eduardo coming out of one of these tombs, all like "aaarrghh!"? Uh, just seeing he'd been replaced, he'd stay dead. - Victoria? - Well, he must've been replaced... That's just what he would think, because of course, it's not true, because you and I are not... Aaah! Darling, you scared me! - (both) Aaah! - Hello, young ones. Yes sir! A ballsy costume, Eduardo! - My name is Eyegor. - (laughs) He even wears a hump! - What hump? - Oh, listen, are you saying it's Leo? I don’t know, it’s not his voice. What are you doing disturbing the peace of death? Leo..., the police are looking for you. We could have very serious problems. But don’t worry, because we will come up with a plan. It is my duty to ensure peace of mind for the souls that dwell here. Bravo, bravo... Listen, I don't know for sure if that's Leo, but don’t tell me this guy's not an actor. - He's really nailing Igor! - "Eye"gor. - Shh! Leo, listen to me, please! - Shh! - Listen to... the silence of death! - Bravo. - AAAAA! - Ah! - Honey, please... - What? Tell him something, from actress to actor, please. My son, don’t you understand that both Leo and I are “actors of the method”? I can't just tell him to leave his character like, "hey, come on". No. So that you understand, it's not like you when you act as a father, where you say, "Now I'm a father, now I'm not, look." - No, there are some roots here, "fucker"! - Enough with this topic. Please help me. If you don’t do it for me, do it for Raulito. Your future is at stake. Yes, because you care so much... - Victoria... please. - Oh, boy, listen to me... Well, here it goes! Come on! Stop fooling around, we have to fuck off, come on! - Tsk tsk tsk! - "Ne-ne-ne" nothing, come on! - Take off your "hump" once and for all. - Ugh! (man) Hey, the actors can't touch you! - I'm a real cop! - Shit! - Oh, what is a cop doing here? - I told you they were looking for him! - The mat! - Oh my god! Oh, what am I going to do? Please, I'm pregnant, a little clemency! What will I do deprived of liberty with a baby, please? - That's it, let's go, let's go! - Eh! Raül, what do I do? What will I do? Listen to me, everything will be fine. You stay here... stay here. Trust me! How do you expect me to trust you again, man?! Go, man, go, this is shit! Twice abandoned! Go, man, go! Go ahead, kill me already, man! This is bullshit, I don't want to live! Victoria Argenter. You know what she did?! Your whoring daughter?! Where she comes from and where she goes? # And what she spends her free time on? # - Don't get it, huh? - No, don't get it. Where is Leo? Man, of course, think about it: no wig, no makeup, no bed, without a nightgown... This wouldn't even work for Meryl Street. I don’t have the tools to make it believable. Is it true, what you said? All... of this story is true? It, it was... it was an excuse. Anyway, I don’t know if it was very convincing, right? Yesterday you went to Crakòzia. Why-why... why did you go there? Crakòzia? What the hell...? No. No, I was at a party yesterday. I have a hangover today that's killing me! It was you... You convinced Dad to sacrifice himself for us. It can't be, he... he always had the ring, didn't he? And you knew it. Why didn't you tell us anything, Nando? Because I made a promise to your father. Manu didn't leave us in a panic, he abandoned us because... because that’s what he wanted to do from the beginning. - If it were up to him, I wouldn’t have been born. - You weren't supposed to know, Fran. Your father abandoned you and I tried to stop his escape. - Your father is what he is. - But why are you defending him? My dad... is a fucking idiot! - You have to explain this to mom. - No... Yes, yes, she's angry with you! She thinks you're irresponsible, and Manu is a hero. It’s not true, and you’re starting something together, it’s not fair! Ever since your father came here, your mother keeps telling me... that I have no reason to worry, okay? And I want to believe it’s true. And all that’s happening is making things very difficult, yes. But if you're really in love with someone, you don’t start doing all this fucking shit every time you have a problem. You don't. And your mother will forgive me. She may find it hard to understand why I'm doing some things, but she will forgive me. - I'm going now. - What's going on? Fran. # Here we are, # not planning anything at all... Have you seen Alex? - No, no idea. - No. Okay. # I wonder if we've lost control. Alex? # So, what do you say? Alex! Alex? (door: opens) # If we just run away. Without you, I'm...I'm nobody. Huh? Nothing. # Tears understand..., # make you turn me down... # A little respect, this here is private property, huh! Oh, well, listen, hey, you don't have to grab me by the neck, I'm not a rabbit! Where is this Leo? Bring him in. - He escaped. - What do you mean he escaped? - Find him! - Don't bother! We have him right here. But... but what the hell have you done?! I have come to confess. I am the only one to blame. It's all my fault. - And mine, and mine. - We are solely responsible. All right, it’s them, it’s them. This, this is the imposter! - Who told you?! - I was told..., I have contacts! Look, everyone shut up! And you, close the door, this is looking like Las Ramblas. - Miss officer... take me away. - (door: closes) But what are you doing? Get up, do yourself a favor. Yes. - Start at the beginning. - Uhh... are you starting? Mm, yes. It was a sunny morning..., when my mother got off the tram at Tetouan Square, feeling strong contractions. Not that close to the beginning. No, no, no, it's that this detail matters, okay. Yes, because she had always told me... that, precisely, when that moment came, she thought: "Look, let's just have him here." (laughs) "This kid is destined to do really great things!" And you see, here I am. 68 years old..., tired of making shitty short films for students from ESCAC..., with inedible catering; of fleeing from the police in Las Ramblas..., when I stand as a living statue pretending I'm like George Clooney from "Ocean's Eleven"; of repeating to myself as a mantra... "I'm on the right track I'm just short a little luck because... then my career will take off..., at 68 years old." Not even the best actor in the world could make you believe such nonsense, and I, ladies and gentlemen..., am not the best actor in the world. And when Raül came to my house, I'd been eating boiled rice without tomato sauce for three months... and said I could make 30,000 euros just by swindling these poor people..., I told him yes, I would do everything possible. - Do you want to shut up?! Shut up, fucker, shut up! - Shhh! - All this is a lie, okay? - No... No, everything... What?! For 30,000 euros I sold my dreams, my dignity... and now maybe, too, my freedom, which is the only thing I had left. - One moment, please... - Leo was the hands. But I am the mastermind of the operation. I promised you I would be your lawyer. That we would take care of each other. This is what a good lawyer does with his clients. But I took... the easy way. Raül... I tried... to toss you aside, with nothing. I thought that... Little chicken... I thought I deserved your forgiveness, but now I understand that... after all I’ve done, I can’t expect anything. - Raül! - I understand, I understand, I'm sorry. I just wish this confession would give you... a new chance. Come on, don't shed any more tears for this bastard, a traitor like any other. I've dealt with his type before. Look, the only thing I did was not go to dinner! Come on, we've bothered these poor people – and this idiot – enough. What-what do you mean we've bothered these po...?! Don't you see that they're making a fool of you?! That this is another of their schemes?! Isn’t there anyone with half a brain in the entire police force?! Mr. Navarro, I advise you to go home and suck a lime. A lime?! Mr. Dorado, you are under arrest for fraud, for forgery of documents and for usurpation of identity. I'm sorry, sparrow, I'm sorry. You have the right not to testify, if you do not want to. Oh! Oh, what is this? Oh, I see, you think you won? Yes, is that it? Very well, when the true will goes into effect, you will have to return all the money. You will be left with nothing, homeless, and you know what you will do again? You’ll steal again, which is all you know how to do! And then, yes, I will catch you! For now, this house is ours. So get out of here right now. - Out! - Ah! - Now! - Ah! Imbecile. He always does... What a machine, dude. A hero like Dad, huh. David, D-Dad isn't... And now what? We're left with nothing else. We will think of something... we will overcome. Everything, mm? (quiet) We will overcome. (lamp: clanking) What a thrill! I've never seen a police car from the inside. Hey, did you see it? Huh, huh? They really swallowed what I was saying about myself, huh. And do you think you can be convincing enough to fool the judge too? Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah. I promise we will come out of this convicted. Oh, yeah! I get the impression that this will be the greatest role of my life. And I estimate that you will be able to play it for at least 10 seasons. (clears throat) Mua, mua... (serious voice) "How do you plead?" (normal voice) "Guilty." (serious voice) "The defendant pleads guilty." (normal voice) "Guilty, Your Honor." (Raül) "We are all afraid, at some point in our lives." “Whether from the darkness of night; "to lose a trial as a lawyer, because your own client has threatened to kill you... " Raül, I'm pregnant. (Raül) "Or being the father of a child when you're not ready yet." "And all of us, when we are there, we feel exactly the same crazy urge to fucking run. " Well, how are you, my darling? Come on, say, "daddy"! Don't believe it! (Raül) "But what distinguishes the brave from the cowards, is what we do when the time comes for the truth. " Bingo. If there are no tickets to Hawaii, put me on the first available long flight. - (Raül) "And I..." - Rio? Fantastic. "I had always preferred to be the coward who leaves flowers on the grave, than the hero buried underground. " - Hey, wait, it's me! - What are you crazy?! For the love of God! - Why are you running away from me? - Oh! (Raül) "I liked to think, somehow, that cowardice was actually a sign of intelligence. " "But, you know what? I was wrong." "Those who stayed when the rest of us up and left... Nando! "... they were neither stubborn nor ignorant, nor idiots with a desire to be a hero. " "It was because they had a compelling reason to sacrifice for the rest." I love you so much. (Raül) "A reason I had never known..., but now I see it very clearly. " - "Hola"! - Wow! Thank you for coming. (Raül) "The worst sentence is not to face your fears." Victoria Argenter, do you want to marry me? Raül Dorado, yes! (Raül) "But to let the cowardice make you lose the one you love the most." Thank you, my love! - I love you! - Thanks! (mobile: message alert) NIL: What a shame that Raul sacrificed himself. I bet you'd have been sexy in a prison uniform. ALEX: I'm sexy in anything. NIL: You're right. We're alike in that way. The issue of inheritance: what does Marcos say? He wants to keep the house and leave us on the street! You must steal the original will and destroy it before the reading! Do you have any idea how we could possibly destroy the will? What do we need? A thief! Alex can call Nile, they're all "tap-tap-tap" all day anyway. There! - What does she mean you talk to Nile? - Well, just that. What's up? The truth is that when you called me I was expecting something more intimate. Fran, you come with me. You have no reason to be against me. Alex has forgotten about you, that's it. You can't burn this will! What is all this you have assembled? Cheetos and potato chips... I thought it would be appropriate for the occasion. It's the reading of a will. Jesus, what a disgrace! Listen, you don't put out enough of the Cheetos, there are other people! You're not alone! They're all fucking here. - Don't-don't put it like that, either. - No? You've staged a coup! - Man, a coup, no... - Against me...! I will never forgive you. Raül Dorado, prisoner and lawyer. - Raül Dorado? - Yes, that's me. Do we know each other? Guards!
