 200,000 euros, to recover the flat that was seized from you. What the fuck did you do, now?! The dough is in the freezer. Raül, I'm pregnant. What's wrong? He's emotional, it's that he's more excited than I am. You keep playing, but if you're not careful, she'll run off with another one. Yes, "bro", the Nile is a textbook "fucker". But your “bro” is here to help you. If Angela had been with someone, do you know who they might be? - Nando, you and Angela...? - We're together.

 You have always envied me because I am better than you! - I love her, "bro"! - (alarm) - No, Manu, what the fuck did you do?! - (alarm) Tomorrow in the early hours you will help Teresa get out of the country. - "Alex is my brother's pussy." - And this? (David) "You seen the freezer we have?" We kept my grandfather's body there, to steal his inheritance. And if you don’t, this recording will come to light. Did you understand? You have to go here. "Crakòzia"? But... wha-what country is this? I — I don’t know, I have no idea. Damn, if Fran doesn't know... It's in the ass of the world, Angela. A map? What, you didn’t have dough for a GPS, or what?

 GPSs leave a trail, baby braids. So, memorize the journey. You, you too...! - You got it? - Yes? All done? You will take Teresa tied to the toilet. All you have to do is take it to the destination. - Who's in Krakow? - My father is in Krakow. He'll know what to do with Teresa, that's all you need to know. I won’t take the kids if we don’t know where we’re going. If you don't mind us posting David's video, you can refuse. You idiot! You have to be there tomorrow at 10am. If any of you 5 don't arrive, we will post the video. If you arrive accompanied, we will post the video. - If you make a call... - ...you will post the video. Very good. - Any other questions? - Yes, yes, I-I have a question. You said that Teresa will be tied to the toilet..., where will we pee? Well... - Shitty traitor! - (woman: clears throat) - Ah, sorry. - Fff! Grabbing her by the waist as if she were a teenager. It's 'cause this guy doesn't know shit, he doesn't have... - Mmm! Mmm! - Ah, sorry, sorry. Oh, poor thing... What, are you sad? Look, if you take my handcuffs off, I'll pat you on the back, then you let me go... and nothing happened here. Do you know why my family left me here alone with you? Because your brother has replaced you and your family wants to know absolutely nothing about you? - No. - Oh no? Because they trust me and they know I will never let you escape. Look, you bastard, if I'm here it's your fault, so rig it however you like to come on the trip and help me escape halfway! - You owe me. - Doesn't bother me. Oh, and what, you think they'll ask you to be godfather? - Godfather of what? - Nando and Angela, when they get married. I can see it now: she's in white, but very modern, and Nando... "Okay," "okay," enough! Do you want to stop spouting nonsense?! Mom thinks you're useless. Nile would sell you right away. Angela doesn't want you back. Half of your children don't even remember you, and your brother... is looking forward to you disappearing! But me... But you... you're still hanging on to me. But me, I just hate you!, so right now I am your best choice. Stop staging mini-movies with Angela and help me escape! You are so wrong. It can't be half of my children: there's 3 of them. Of course, Einstein, very good! But if you think about it, you will realize that running away with me is the best thing you can do. Time to leave. Nando, hold her. Nile, Nile, I don't want to go with Dad, I'm not 15, "fuck"! - If they catch you, you go with Dad. - Nile, please! Ah, ah, ah! Rules are rules. Although some family rules are skipped... - Right, traitor?! - Ah! Grab her! - (police: siren) - (helicopter) (megaphone: man) "The neighborhood is cordoned off." "It is totally forbidden to leave your homes." - No! - Tie her up again. (megaphone: man) "We ask, please, to facilitate agents' access to your homes." Do you think... do you think they are looking for Teresa? Yes...? - Fran, please don't scare me. - No, no... (Peter) They've been flying over the neighborhood for 10 minutes. I'd say it's the neighbor on the corner, who has an iguana. Sure, sure, this whole thing for an iguana. Makes sense... No, man, no. No, no, of course... Oh! Adela! Adela left this morning to do I don't know what, and she didn't return, and I don’t know if something has happened. Police! Darling... Adela, please, you don’t have to call the cops every time we walk into a place. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm... I'm very excited. - Well, what, what's up, Miquel? - Can I explain it myself? - I'm an agent now. - Citizen collaborator. Well, it turns out that thanks to the information provided... by an anonymous and very observant citizen..., we suspect that the neighborhood has... - An iguana. - "It has a" what?! A fugitive, and you can't get out of the area. Ah-ah, yes? Um... Go tell them inside, eh? - Yes, yes... - Go, go, go! - Go, go, go... - We're checking all the houses. This is the photograph of the criminal. - Look familiar? - (both) No. She is usually accompanied... by certain accomplices. An old lady and a young man, six foot three, something like that. - Are they dangerous? - "Are they dangerous?" They are one of the most dangerous gangs in this country, and very professional. We had not been able to identify any of its members until yesterday. - Listen, who are you? I haven't seen you. - I'm Alex's boyfriend. - And Fran? - Listen to me, wait a minute... Who asks the questions here? Peter, are you a cop or a citizen collaborator? - Yeah, but the girl... - You aren't, are you? Hey, hey, hey, curiously..., in the burglary at which we were able to photograph her, there were none of the usual members. The chimpanzee's mask was worn by a man in a striped shirt... - You! - Me? It's you! You! Oh, no. No, no, Miquel, no, you're getting it wrong. How could you leave Angela pregnant and with two children?! - Two children! - (both) Yes, yes, yes... It's him, it's him. You can stop him, if you want, don't be shy, Miquel. - It's just he doesn't-- - But, sorry, do we know each other from...? I am Miquel Ibáñez Monroy. Big Mac? You can tell what he's doing here, right? I thought you had stopped making bad decisions in your personal life, Angela. Um... well, he... - Ha-has come to see the children. - Yes. - You've come to see the children? Now. - The kids. Well, in short: the roads are blocked and... and you can't leave the neighborhood until further notice. (Nile) And... do you know how long this will last? It's just that Alex and I had thought about going to the beach, to fly some kites. - Yes... - We are very much in love. - Right, "Tiny"? - Yes, he loves his pet names. In fact, I don’t know what to do with a guy as syrupy as you. Very well, then, to answer your question, about 7 or 8 hours. - 8 hours?! - Yes. We'll come to search the house later. But don’t worry, because I’m sure you have nothing to hide. - No, no, of course not! - No, no... And if you try to escape, “bam, bam!”, Two shots and you're toast. "Bam, bam!" Listen, since we have a few hours, what do you think? We could play some board games together, right? Make it a bit "recreational", no? ...Okay, we'll meet up! # # WELCOME TO THE FAMILY Look, if there are no tickets to go to Hawaii, put me on the first very long flight available. Rio. Fantastic. First class, above all. - What time does it leave? - Raül! Shit! Fuck everything, Jesus! (away) Raül! Raül! Where are you? I don't see you! Where are you? Where are you?! Darling! My love! I was here, stretching my legs. What is it, how are you? - Look... - What is this? His name is Raulito. I saw, in a serious documentary, mind you, that now people are buying the Baby Born. - What? - Yes, Baby Born. This is a knock off because they were very expensive, but I bought it for parenting practice! - (child: crying) - Oh, but hey, what's wrong? - She's crying. - Yeah, I can see that... Uh, how do I shut him up? What, what? I’m getting nervous, I swear to you. No, darling, don't worry. He is not a real child. Why, because we're not married? You're "old fashioned." - No, woman, because it's plastic. - Oh, now I get you, it's true. - Eh! - Take out the batteries and there you are. Please don’t take the magic away from me! Kids don’t carry batteries, darling! If you remove the battery you kill it. - Come on, please! Eh, what's up? - Understood. - Metaphorically, darling. - Yes, yes, understood. I know, right? Oh, darling, chickadee, I'm sorry. - But now I want to do very well. - Of couse. Because Alex turned out fine, but a little... Yes, Alex... Although this time, like it or not, I'm with you, I'm not alone, and that leaves me calmer. Right, we will be 3? Here, go with your father. No, no, no!, I'm n-not... I'm not feeling well. I’m dealing with a very urgent issue, I can’t. Oh, oh, oh..., and what, you want me to do it all on my own? No, no, no! Come on. - What kind of father would you be, man! - (Alex) Mom... Oh look, a little brother! Fucking god... Umm... we have a problem, "okay"? - Oh? - Follow me. Why does everything always have to go wrong for us? Why? - Come on, it'll work out. - Yeah, it'll work out... Sure, everything will turn out fine, don’t worry. The power of love will fix everything! - You don't know anything. - What? The roads are closed and they're conducting a search, they will find out for sure! That is if David doesn’t explain everything while some cop is listening first. - That's enough, isn't it? - (doll: crying) - Shh! Now it's crying. - One thing is for sure. If they find me here, you're fucked, so let me go, I'll live my life and you live yours! If you let her go, Mom posts the video and you all go to jail. - Yeah, yeah, enough. - Listen, man, here we go! Look, Chickadee, huh, you're  the man with the plan, "right"?, now imagine that you have to flee this house; hypothetically, I'm saying. - What would you do, darling? Be careful. - Right now, I find it complicated. Of course, he's going to be a father and has other priorities. Listen up. Do it however you want. Get Teresa out of this house now. (doll: still crying) I'll be right back. Miquel! Miquel! - Sorry. - Miquel! Sorry... - Yes. - I know, I know, but it's just that... We have to get out of the house, it's urgent, Miquel. - You know I’ve done a lot for you. - Yes, I know. - But I can't. You'll have to wait. - Miquel, please... - I made them a promise. - What-what... what did you tell them? When Fran and David were little, I promised them that... when David reached 4 feet 6 inches... - We would all go to Port Aventura together. - Yes. - It's the minimum height... - (both) ...for the Dragon Khan. Yeah. The day that I... The day I left home, I passed in front of their room and through the crack in the door I saw that... that they were measuring their height. David was leaning against the wall and Fran told him that... he was still an inch short, that he should only have to wait a little longer. The other day when I arrived I made the same promise. You'll think it's nonsense, we could go there any day, but... I know I don’t deserve it. I’ve been a coward too long to deserve anything. But you are a family man, Miquel. You know I owe them. And her too. - I'm getting emotional. - Peter, Peter, don't cry... - It's just that crying... - Peter, don't cry here, man, not here! Feelings are left at the door. Go back home, please, we're working here. - I'll leave. - Go. Forgive me, Agent. Please. Please. Grab your raincoats. - Excuse me? - What? For the Tutuki Splash, the kids will get wet, they'll be soaked! - For Tutuki, yes... - (laughs) It's just, really...! Thanks. I swear to you this time I thought we shit the bed for real. - Oh, then, I'm not coming, am I? - It would be a little weird, right? - It's better not to try your luck. - No, of course, yes, yes. - What's wrong? - Nothing... Well, I don't know: going... going to a strange country, with a criminal tied to the toilet... I don’t know, I care about you, that’s all, and the kids. - You're jealous. - Me? Jealous of whom? Nando, seriously, you don’t have to worry about anything. We're just doing a little theater, mm? Tomorrow night we will be here again. Nando, I wouldn't go back with Manu in even a million years, mm? He keeps throwing shit at me for being a traitor. - And besides, I know him... - No, don't go down to his level. You are the smart brother. Look, I promise if the police catch us... it will be you who gets the face-to-face visits. - Oh, thank you. - Do you like the face-to-faces? - Man... - Huh? - And the shackles? - I prefer this... - This? - Nothing in between. - And if the face-to-face is without things... - Do you want to shut up, already? Handsome. # ("Trembling Stars", Pájaro Sunrise) # # It's been almost two years of quiet grief and hidden tears # since the girl with the restless eyes went and broke my heart. # And nothing much has changed, sometimes I feel... Alex, hey, I... - What? - I want to tell you that... What? No, that-that... that yesterday, when David said that, that I swear I didn't know anything about it, really. I mean, yes it is... yes it is true that I was worried about you... I believe you, Fran. - Yes? - Yes. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn I think we should take advantage of this trip to clear our heads a bit. What... what do you mean? That maybe this thing of ours can’t be, right? I mean, we did much better when we were just friends. Now all day we're scratched, stung by a misunderstanding, or by... Is it because of Nile? What...? What are...? You see? What does Nile have to do with it, Fran? I'm talking about you and me. Right, um..., a lot has happened the last few days, and I need to reflect on all of this too. When you come back we'll talk about it calmly. Okay? Yes? # I hate to admit it but it's time to leave her behind. # Trembling stars hanging up high, won't you wish me now good luck? # I hate to admit it but it's time to leave her behind. # Bollocks! You do everything behind my back, don't you?! I was making sure to have it all in my bag. And you should hire someone, the house looks like shit. - Do you want something? - No. No, well, just that... have a good trip, mm? And...take care of them (for me). [cuida-me'ls] What a domain of pronouns. You always got a better grade than me in Catalan. - What? - "Cuida-me'ls". As if they were yours and I had to take care of them for you, right? Look, Nando... let it go. Now, Muhammad Ali is here, the fighters will disappear. Why are you telling me this? I'm telling you because... despite being a shitty traitor..., who when I left didn't wait two seconds... - 11 years. - Not two seconds... 11 years, "bro"! Not two seconds to try and steal my family, even so, since you are my brother..., I don't want you to suffer, mm? Too late! (megaphone: man, background) "The neighborhood is cordoned off." (police: siren) Angela can't stand you, Manu! Look, Nando, you and I, how can I say this... While you were with your band trying to fuck, your "bro"... your "bro" was already fucking. Of course! Angela needs some time to get used to the idea that I’m back. And when that happens, we already know what she will decide. She will decide the same thing she decided 25 years ago. So if I were you, I'd take advantage of these two days to relax, forget a little about this subject for me and accept what's going to happen with dignity, okay? - Let's leave it at that. - "Good", mm. Is this all you packed for the trip? For what Angela and I will do in the motorhome, I already packed too much. - Yes... - Huh? Right, come on. (megaphone: man, in the background) "The police are talking to them." "The neighborhood is cordoned off." - Manu, come on! - Ah, Manu is coming too? Nando! We will take a real family trip another day. Of course. - Go. - Yes. # Your hands tell me things I've never heard before. # Your arms are the safest walls I've ever been between. # Because you stick to me, you're my drug, # you take me back to paradise. # I'm lost inside your smile, and I've never felt this way. # 'Cause you're my sweetest dream, my cotton candy. # Because you stick to me, you're my drug. # I can see the light in every city when you open your eyes. # You run through my blood, you take me back to paradise. # (Miquel) Wait! Hey! - Hey! Heeey! Hey! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't forget to go see the show "Birds of Paradise"! It’s amazing, it’s wonderful! Really, you can't miss it! Someone should go see how Teresa is. - Right. - Fran, you look, go. - Me? - Yes, go! - (knocks) - (Teresa) Ah, ah! Ah! Mm! Ah! - Hey... - Ah... - Um... - Mm! Mm! How are you, how-how...? You're still all tied up, huh? Look, if I weren’t all tied up, I swear you'd already know. Mm! Mm! Um... I'm not in the mood, Nile. Sorry, sorry. What's wrong? Come on, you can tell me everything. If not, let David. Don't laugh, don't laugh... I can’t believe you’re amused by such a cruel joke, you’re a cynic. Wow, you're stupid, but stupid stupid, eh! Listen, what I told you before, that you were my girlfriend, was a joke. I mean... an alibi for the police. - You're not my type at all. - You would like it. You've lost your ass for me since you walked in that door, mm? You see? That's true. - May I? - Heeey... you wanna tell me what you're doing? If the police won't let me leave the neighborhood, then I will have to stay here to sleep. I was looking to see if I fit on this couch, but I see I don’t. You don't happen to have a bed for me? A bed? Mm... Look, I don't have a bed..., but I have some cardboard boxes in the garage that will make you feel at home, for sure. Can we both fit? Does this shit ever work for you? - Yes, sometimes, yes. - Jesus, dude, well... (Adela) What are you doing, what are you doing with your shoes on the table?! - If Eduardo were here. - Who? Excuse me? Didn't you talk about Eduardo with your... new boyfriend? Yes..., yes, Adela, yes, but he doesn't listen to me. This relationship makes water everywhere. "She hasn't told him about Eduardo." (Miquel) Adela! Come search the rooms! I'm coming! Pst, pst! - Now it's here on the right. - OK. Jesus! But-but Miquel, Miquel didn't warn us about this. No. Speed ​​up, GTA Lightning. Calm down, confusing cops is my specialty. - Don't do anything stupid, do you hear me? - You leave it to me. Smile, children. - Hello. - Good morning. Is there a problem, beautiful? - What did you say to me? - I asked if there was a problem. No, not that, the... "beautiful" thing. What... what-what... what's going on? - (Sara) Watch who you call "beautiful"! - Are you crazy or what?! (Manu) Calm down. - She's back, she's back... - Smile, smile. I've had enough, get out of the vehicle for inspection. What inspection? Oh, us, we don't... Madam, all the cars coming out of the neighborhood... have to pass a police inspection, because we suspect... Yes, yes, yes, we are aware. But we have been told that we can pass directly. - Who? - Agent Miquel Ibáñez. He has authorized us personally. Call him on the walkie-talkie, if you will. I don't care what Miquel told you, is that clear? Do you think it's okay to talk like that about your superior? I’m his superior. Agent Ibáñez is on indefinite suspension. Because some kids were playing with his department issued sidearm. Miquel, right now, has no authority. So get out of the vehicle, please. - And now what do we do? - What do I have to do, kill you? Victoria, sorry, but I've been looking at you for a while... Well, I'm used to it. It’s the story of my life, always the same. No, it's like you're... different, like you're... ...radiant. "Radiant"?! Well, I'm pregnant, a "baby," with Raul Dorado. - No! Congratulations! - Yes! - How? It can't be. - Come on, "it can't be"! The doctor told me, she says: "Wow, she's still superfertile!" She says, "But, like, fertile fertile, huh!" What you are is an adulteress, girl, it's obvious! That it wasn't a month, not a month since Eduardo left us, Vicky! Enough! Getting pregnant is very good news, always! - Yes, Agent. - Good. Now we leave the rooms, there's nothing here. - And let Victoria rest. - Thank you, Mr. Agent. - Let's inspect the garage. - Shit! Because... because-because-because... because we've neglected sunscreen, bollocks! And in Salou the sun burns a lot, oh, it burns a lot! Don't worry, you can find sunscreen in Port Aventura. They will be able to find sunscreen. Adela..., let's go. Have you seen how this menopause has turned out? Oh! Victoria, Manu's money is hidden in the garage, inside the freezer, and if they find it we are... - Oh mother! - That's right. - (doll: crying) - My son! Light of my life... Container for money that will not attract attention if it's found by the fuzz. Like so, fantastic, very good... Do you have a ganeta? And we’ll put it on the tummy, too. Here, very good... Very good..., all my precious child's money. (Miquel) Let's see, for God's sake, what are you saying, man? - We'll talk about that later. - Mother of god! (Miquel and Adela: conversation, unintelligible, approaching) Here..., good good... (doll: crying) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... - Oh, oh, oh, oh... - What are you doing here? Nothing, the boy. Oh, oh, oh... - What is this? - Ah! It's a Baby Born Interactive 78, made in the Philippines. Mm-hm. I have a couple, at home, to practice as a future father. Exactly, this- this is one of them. Yes, I want it to sleep, and here, in the dim light, well, it's very relaxing. Jesus, very well done, Raül, very well! Honey, the boy had to sleep and I went down here for the dark. - Yes, yes... Miquel, Micky. - What's up, what's up? Look, I wanted to tell you something. If you don't mind, we'd like it... if you didn't touch the freezer too much. - Please don't touch it. - No, man, don't worry. - Not that you had a corpse in it, eh? - Ah, can you imagine? No, it's just that, look, for us it's like a sacred temple, it’s like a “grave,” I don’t know how to say it. It's like that sheet that they discovered of Jesus Christ, you know? Well for us that's it. Do you understand the problem, Miguel? - I understand you perfectly. - Thank you dear. What's more, as a sign of respect, we won't touch the freezer... (door: opens) - Well there's nothing here. - Oh... oh, no? - Well, no. No, no, indeed. - (doll: crying) Um... Raül, don't strangle him so much. - A little less... - Oh, yes, yes, yes. Look how cute, duel of parents! Well, it looks like there's nothing here either, eh? I think it's time to move on to Eduardo's office. Adela, please go with Nando and Victoria... to find the key? Come on, come on. Pst, pst, pst! Tsk-tsk! - (door: closes) - What's going on? Now that we're alone... can you tell me what's going on here? H-here? What-do you mean? Specifically, what do you mean? No, no... Because I suspect that Raül Dorado... has saved a seed in Mom's tummy! - Yes, yes! Yes, yes, what joy! - Yes, we will be parents! - Yes! Yes! - Finally! - How do you feel, how do you feel? - Well, well-then... - Very strong emotions..., good. - Yes, yes, of course! To think we'll have one of these in our hands, my God! - Look how handsome! - Careful, careful! With care, with care, please..., with caution. Ugh, so angelic, so full, so full of... Of... of joy, and of love, and of... - Oh, my God...! - Yes... Listen to me, we are privileged, you and I, huh! - Of course! - Like no one else! You and me! I couldn’t express it better! And so, and so, and so... Listen, will it be a natural birth or what? It seems that the father plays a very important role. Yes, we are still finalizing the details, we are like... And have you read "My Child Won't Eat"? Yes, I-I've got 20 pages left, it’s very emotional. In the end will he eat, will he not eat...? Don't tell me, eh, no spoilers! It’s just that I love that you’re so involved, really. - Very, very involved. - Oh, it's just... I don't know, in the end..., in the end it will turn out that... there is hope for the men of this family, right? Yes, yes. You are about to make a very important journey. An unforgettable journey! You know that, don't you? Oh, I know very well. Yes, yes, it’s a journey, oof! Very long, very. - (sighs) - Yes, yes, yes... Well, I'll leave you, eh. Sorry, I'll leave you, you're very busy. - Yes, very good. - The cops have a lot of work to do. - Oh, of course, yes, yes. - You understand? But hey, well, yeah... we'll talk about this some another time. - I guess later... - Yes, the topic is her own master... Yes, her own master. Man! Master for the rest of your life, eh, Raul. The rest of your life. (Miquel: sighs) (door: opens and closes) - Angela, wait. - What? - Give me the keys to the shackles. - No. - Trust me. - Not on your life! Give me a good reason! I have a plan, Angela. Please, we don't have time. - Mom, please give them to him! - Come on. - Hey, Manu... - Trust me. Come on! Get that policeman in the back to come to the door, too. - "Okay," come on. Come on, let's go! - Come on. (megaphone: man) "It is totally forbidden to leave the neighborhood." - "The neighborhood is cordoned off." - And the other one? - Um... h-he-he's... he's coming down now. - (David) Down now. (megaphone: man) "We ask, please, that you facilitate agents' access to your homes. " Hey, sir, policeman! - What do you want? - Can you come here for a moment, please? - What's going on? - No, it's-it's... to-to... To me, if-if I have-have to..., if you have to search me, I'd rather have a man do it. No, no. Well, I have no problem with you..., you know? With me, what? Well... I have no problem like that in general, in life. - Anyone else feel like being funny? - No! We've had enough... yes. It's the cops, they're on that side. If you go out this window no one will see you. You'll need a car to escape. - Perfect. - Wait! I better buy it. Here's what we'll do. Wait for me in the back alley of the used car lot, where we bought the motorhome. - No one should see you. - Will you come with me? You convinced me before. I was just waiting for the moment. Ah, Manu... - Great! - Go, go, go, go, run! - We'll find each other at the lot. - Yes! Manu..., if you betray me, I swear I'll kill you. - Yes? - Yeah. Go on. (woman) And what, Casanova's not coming out? Okay, I've had enough. To the brim. Get away from the door, please. Get away from the door, please, get out the way. - Thanks. - One moment, one moment... - Sorry. - (man) No worries. - Fuck! - Fuck, what? - Let's run! - None of that nonsense, please! (Manu) Sorry, officer. I just finished. "Finished"? "Finished"...? The turtle had his head sticking out. Sorry. Well, that's it. Sorry for the inconvenience. You can go. - Oh, done-done? - Yes. - Oh... - Hey, thanks. - Thank you so much. - (man) Have fun. - See ya. - Bye. Bye, thank you. Bye. Well, where is she? Where is she? What, is she under the wheels? Or up, up on the roof, hidden? Where? I let her escape. She went out the window. - What?! - What did you want? We had no choice. You said you had a plan, and that is a shitty plan! - Yeah, you are useless! - These people will hang us all. Oh, Fran, darling..., calm down, huh? Take your Ventolin, go inside. - Come on, let's go. - Let's get outta here. Everything will be fine. - We are lost! - Angela, Angela... Slow down a bit, I have everything under control. I made her believe I was on her side. She's waiting at a used car lot, and she thinks we'll buy a car and run away together. What she doesn't know is that I won't... I will never leave my family again. If you betray me again, I swear I will kill you. What an obsession with killing me, bollocks! Bye. We'll go now..., huh? Let's be careful. - Where did you get that, that?! - I stole it from the cop, the fool. - Why?! - Because that way we'll know what's happening. (radio: woman) "Agent Rodolfo has lost his walkie." See?! Go, go, go, get out of here, now, eh, go, get out! There is no one here, Miquel. There is no one? We'll see, we'll see. (Nando) We'll see. - You seem very calm. - We have nothing to hide. No, I’m not talking about that, I’m talking about Manu and Angela. (cough) Manu? Uhhh... you-you are... you're a little bit paranoid, too, huh? "A little" what? You’re used to dealing with bad people, right? Bad like Manu, eh! "Bad people," he says... Believe me, I know him. If there's one thing Manu can do, it's steal Angela. I say this from experience. From experience, I tell you. Yeah, sure. The important thing is that An-Angela would never do something like that. Bullshit! She'll fuck you into a cuck. Man...! It is clear that fidelity is not one of the values ​​of women in this family. Alex has kicked Fran to the couch; Vicky wasted no time replacing poor Eduardo. And they always say, "You can't have two without three." I don't mean anything, you know, but... Angela has tried a couple of approaches, with me. - What? - Hey, calm down. I've made it very clear: I don't want to have anything to do with it. Come on, let's go. The house is clean. Man..., clean clean... It can't be Miquel, he's a policeman. - Police don't steal. - Of course, no, no. And the other is Adela, who has enough with what she already has. - (Raül) Yes. - Who can it be? Fuck. Nando, do you know who could have stolen from us? - Mm? - What? Yes, the cabbage, the dough... from Manu that was in the freezer, fucker. Mm-hm, yeah. - Who could it be? - Well, it must have been that guy, right? - Me?! Yes, man, there it is! - There it is! Always the same! Of course, it's okay to distrust Raul, huh! Look, you distrusted him before, and you saw how well he laundered the money, yes or no? Think about it, and let it rest: Raül would never steal from us, okay, it's just that...! Oh, no? And can you tell us what exactly you were doing in the garage? - Because what a coincidence, no? - He was making the boy fall asleep, beautiful. I haven't been apart from you for an instant. - Search me! Search me! - Of course! I didn’t even know where Manu’s money was. And you, you're not really into this, are you? But enough, also, huh. Angela said she didn't want this money at all, and when Angela makes a decision, I... respect her. And that has to mean something, right? Or no? Is this guy going feeble? He's a sinkhole. What's wrong with him? - Tell us, please, what can we do? - Let's see, that leads you... (Alex) Where could it lead us, please clarify. - Let's see, if it wasn't you... - No. Aaa... Angela and her children, neither... Jesus, it was Manu. - It was Manu, wasn't it? - Manu?! - Look, he woke up, thank goodness! - He's a son of a whore! One moment, guys. And if we say all that is true? - Motherfucker! - The money was from Manu. If we don’t want it for anything, that money... No, no, let's get one thing straight: justice must be done, okay?! And Manu always says he wants to be part of this family. Well, you don't do this to family. That’s true, they’ve done everything for him, already, “man”! It's true. Now, let me say one thing. Now call me stupid, but I wonder: why would Manu steal from himself? It's just that you don't know my brother well, Victoria. He’s a person who always has an ace up his sleeve, you know? Ah! Come on, Fran, darling, you puking or what? We have to leave! - It's just that I can't, Mom, I can't. - "I can't"... (Phone) (Phone) - Yes? - Angela, listen to me... Look, something happened that... Manu took the 200,000. - So what, it was his. - "No, yeah, but the point is that..." "When he found out you didn't want it for anything, he gave it to Fran." Yes, man. And now it's been stolen! The big traitor has fucked his own son out of the money! "What a bastard!" - Who are you talking to? - "Listen to me, Angela." "Now don't make any sudden movements." "All you have to do is keep it secret, and you're going to search Manu's bag, okay? " What's going on? (Manu) "Angela?" - Jesus! - What, what is it? What? An... Angela? What are you looking for? - What am I looking for? - Angela! Angela! - I'll tell you what I'm looking for. - Angela! Angela... - Listen, what are you doing with my backpack? - What am I looking for? I am looking for the money that you gave to your child and that you're trying to take back. I haven’t touched the money. - Oh no? - No! But how can you be such a shameless rat, huh, Manu?! You’ve returned just to disappoint the only child who respects you! - No-no, I-I... - Calm down, Fran. Look, let's see a moment, a moment, a moment! One moment. - Where did you hear that I've got the money? - Nando told me. Ah, Nando. You son of a bitch! You gave it to Teresa, didn't you? I didn't give anything to Teresa, give me...! Leave it to me! Why don't you let me see it? What are you carrying inside? - Nothing, my clothes. - Mom, mom, please. - Dad wouldn't do that, he's changed. - Ah, yes? And when did he change? Because I remind you that 3 days ago he was robbing a jewelry store. "Boom!, in your face". - Let me see it. - No. - Let me see it. - Look. - Let me see inside. - No. - So you packed it, right? - No, I didn't pack it. I won't let you see it for your own good. Yes, because you would open it and see that there is nothing, and you would feel very humiliated about the soap box you got up on, when all I was trying to do was help this family. So if you like, here's what we'll do. I will give you the opportunity to breathe a little..., calm down and apologize. You've never helped anyone in your life! And I don’t breathe because I don't feel like it! Angela! Angela, give me... (radio: Miquel) "Attention, all units!" (radio: woman) "Miquel, go home and stop bothering me." (radio: Miquel) "Pursuit in progress." "Suspect is attempting to flee through the neighborhood forest." - "I need reinforcements, now!" - Shit! No, no, they'll tell everything, they'll show David's video! Now we have shit the bed. Miquel, I have her, I have her! What, what, what, what?! She stumbled and fell there! But I'm aiming at her with a gun, which I don't have! - What the fuck are you doing here, Miquel? - What does it look like I'm doing there? What you don't know how to do. One, two... We know you're back there! We're aiming at you! You can come out now, you have no escape! Come on! It's over! (baby: crying) Don't shoot! Don't shoot, it's me! - Don't shoot, please. - (baby: keep crying) Don't shoot! My only crime is to go out for a walk with this doll in the woods. But with this humidity?! But... but have you gone crazy, Raül?! For God's sake! What are you doing here? Why are you running away from me? Because I heard you run up like that, yelling “police,” and I got scared. I have done nothing, I swear to you, I have done nothing! I didn't do anything. Miquel, go home and rest..., go! - A-a-a... and I can leave? - Yes, go, go, go, go. Fantastic. Because half an hour from now... it's time for his bottle. Oh! Oh! This is... - But why don’t they say anything else? - Shhh! (radio: woman) "We have Miquel's suspect." "It's not the subject we were looking for." "I repeat: he's not the suspect." "He's a middle-aged man, he's very nervous, who only repeats that he is innocent, that he's 'the best lawyer'. " "He was carrying a plastic doll full of banknotes of dubious origin." "A dead end, um..." "We sent him home and confiscated his money." It- It was Raül... You see, Dad didn't have the money. "Boom!, in your face". Do you still want to look at my backpack ? - Seriously, no problem. - No. Very good. So, I assume that we can stop being suspicious of me... and was can all got together to look for Teresa, right? - Yes. - Let's go. - (mobile) - Look! Huh? She found it! - Did I tell you or did I not tell you? - Of course! Yes. Well, Angela, where was it? "Nando, Raül had taken the money." "But that doesn't matter, right now." "Teresa has escaped, we lost her." "Nile can't know." "I think we can fix it, but we have to hurry, we don't have much time." - "Nando?" - Yes, I have the... - Uh...! - I had it on speakerphone, Angela. Hi, Angela. You say you can fix it? Mm-hm, great. I’ll tell Mom that the police cordon has held you back and it's not your fault, and I'll ask her for... a few more hours. Into the fray. - Well, will you call me, "little one"? - Of course! I wouldn’t miss the awesome event of flying a kite for anything in the world. What? Uhh... thank you for not ratting us out. You saved our ass. So in the end it turns out that I am a good person. Mm... well, that remains to be seen. What remains to be seen is how you will react to what I am about to do. What are you about to do? Uhh... I'll call you and to make concrete kite plans. It doesn't make sense for her to leave with the first hottie she finds. - Oh, so Nile is a hottie. - He looks like a model. - Did you put the money in the doll? - No. - And the polygraph rules that... - He's lying. - Oh! - No, I'm telling the truth! - What are we doing here? - That's where I stayed with Teresa. She needs a car. We have to find Manu, and if we find Manu, we'll find the suspect. - Oh, Alex is calling me. - The police are trying to locate us. Notice to all units, this is Agent Ibáñez! I discovered the whereabouts of the suspect. For a moment I thought you might be dumb enough to go with them. - No. - You don't have any say in the family. What the fuck are you doing here? And Teresa? Teresa, Teresa isn't... she's not there. Attention, slow down! Get your hands up!
