 Some people you just never forget. It's like they get burned into your brain. Other people make no impression at all. It's like they're there... and then they're not. - Call it. - That one, sleeping. That's not a person under there. - Is too, curled up. - Where are the legs? Maybe he doesn't have any. - Roxy. - What? Not everybody makes it through life intact.

 We all didn't get a cozy, comfortable life in the suburbs, little girl. Cozy, maybe. Comfortable, never. Clock is ticking. Make your pick. He looks like a Simms. Go ask him-- maybe he'll give you a bite of his squirrel kebab. Um... hi, everyone. Good morning. I'm looking for a mister or miss A. Simms. A. Simms? Who is A. Simms? Bueller? Anyone? Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? We didn't do anything. You can't cite us. Relax. I'm on a mission of mercy. A. Simms.

 We have a missing persons report that needs to be confirmed. Your have rich... and loving relatives that think you're dead. What the fuck? Shit. Ew. I've always said littering should be a capital offense. People. People, back up. This is a crime scene. Montana? Is it Montana? Who's Montana? I'm Montana. Shit! Roxy, what just happened? I got the wrong guy! No I.D. Where the hell is A. Simms? I was Arthur Simms. What? But I haven't used that name since I was 19. Well, he's John Doe now. - Really? - Yeah. We get these guys every day. No I.D., nobody to claim their bodies. What happens to them? Unmarked graves, courtesy of the county. Harsh. George, everybody can't get a monument, or else the world'd be one big-ass graveyard. - You hungry? - Give me your pen. George... George. This is not your problem. Not anymore. John Doe, my ass. - Feel good about yourself now? - I do. Hey! Hey, put that back! Hello! Officer? He's stealing. Tell him to put it back. No, don't. It gets cold out here. He needs it. He needs it more than I do. Good for you, Arthur Simms. Circle of life, baby. Big smiles, everyone. Let's see that Lincoln spirit. Mr. Hammond... on my signal. Steven Peale, quit horsing around. Face forward, please. Thank you. Reggie Lass, I know you have a smile in there somewhere! Well, class, I guess we'll all just have to keep standing here until miss lass decides to get with the program. Lass! Tell her you don't negotiate with terrorists. Sandy, I know you're new here, so I'm going to cut you some slack, but-- "Sandy" is my white slave me. I have a right to be called "Raven". I'm Raven. Okay, mr. Hammond... on three. One... Two... Why should she smile? Isn't her sister dead? Howard Hughes died a derelict, you know. He hadn't cut his fingernails or toenails for five years. Rich people have all the fun. I saw a picture. He was nasty. No, not when I knew him. He was quirky, but handsome. When Howard Hughes died, 400 people claimed to be his heirs. Did you get much, Daisy? 22 liars split $2 billion. $2 billion? Billion? That's--hang on. That's $2 billion divided by 22 people, that equals... that equals a fuckload of money each. George, you should go to the morgue and give John Doe his name back. Tried that already. It didn't work. Well, we could be distant relations. He could be loaded. We need to get down there. I'll go with you. You have no business down at that morgue. I have no business down at that morgue? All of our business is down at that morgue. George, please just do your job. Those are very strong words for a boss who went A.W.O.L. When are you going to show us those slides from your vacation? Or was it a business trip? I think we're done talking about me. We never started talking about you. Well, then you'll have to begin without the benefit of my participation. I have real business to attend to. - You know what? - What? Go to the fucking morgue if you want to. Slide your dead drunken ass into a drawer with some other dead drunk. Take a nap in a body bag. I don't care. He's changed, isn't he? Yeah. Where did he go on those days off? Roxy? He didn't tell me shit. Anyway, he's gone. George, you need to learn a few things about the John Does of this world-- Forget it. I work today, and Millie has used up all her excuses. So tell Millie to get down to the morgue at lunchtime, like normal working people. I actually have to work today, myself... Doing what I was meant to do. Hooker? I'm acting. On a T.V. Show. Are you sleeping with the producer? That's between me and him. I hope so. So are you? Are you sleeping with Ray? George... I'm not the kind of girl that likes to kiss and tell. - Since when? - Since now. I'd love to see you act, Daisy. Then you should come down. Ray would love to see you. I will. And you, too, George. I'm not interested. Didn't care for Ray much. Yeah, ray is an asshole, isn't he? I have to go to work. Georgie-- me, you... down at the morgue, mining for gold. Go there yourself. I don't know what he looks like. Always looking for a quick way to make a buck. Okay. Poor man, though, eh? Poor John Doe. Anonymous... sad. Dust to dust. We just got a John Doe in here about 20 minutes ago. Score. I just want to warn you, seeing a lifeless body can be very difficult. Thank you. That's why we're here together, for each other. Uh... Mason? Mason! Wake up! - Mason! - What? What? My mistake. I'm sorry. My brother here is just in a state of shock. We were very close. He was like an uncle to me. I thought he was your uncle. But so much more. Don't make me look at him. Hold me. Hold me. I can't bear to see uncle Arthur this way. It's not him... I knew that. Heh... Mate? How many fucking John Does do you got in this fucking freezer? Five. Well? Do we have a winner? I'm crying on the inside. Anyway, does it say there if my uncle left any of his personal effects at the scene? What? In his shopping cart or his sleeping bag? Nothing of value, if that's what you're shooting at. Shut up. You're a fucking liar. Nothing but the clothes on his back. All right then, thank you. Bye. Coming, Georgie? I thought your name was Millie. Hagen. - It is. - It is? I think I'm going to stay a moment. Say a proper goodbye. It's not my job to say who lives and dies, and it sure as shit isn't my job to give anybody a little dignity when they do. My job sucks. Miss Hagen? Miss Hagen? Fuck, that's me. Oh, yes? Is this the correct address to send the bill for the burial costs? - What burial costs? - $400. - Why am I getting hit with this? - You're the next of kin. If he had been a John Doe, the county would assume the costs, but he's not. He's Arthur Simms. And he's got family. No... he doesn't. He doesn't have anyone. Oh, now I get it. Generosity is for people who can afford it. I should have seen this coming. I was always good on initial impulse. I never earned any badges for follow-through. Georgia, you said you wanted to do this. I did. You signed up to sell a hundred boxes of cookies. You do it. We are going outside to sell these cookies. It's too hot. Now. It's too stressful. We need to move these. I just wanted the stupid badge. You can't get the badge until you sell the cookies. Screw the badge. Go to your room. No dinner for you, young lady. This doesn't really feel like professional acting, Ray. I mean, we're setting up in the back of a bar. Daisy, that's what reality television is. We ambush. Yeah, I'm just saying it'd be nice to have a set. Daisy, we have something better than a set. We have a bar room full of people who have no clue we're filming them. One of whom you're going to get to play an adulterer. Trust me, it's going to feel very much like acting. Tighten up camera two for me, please. I need a script. Words to commit to memory. That, to me, is acting. Okay, here's your script-- pretend you like the guy... and get him to like you. - How's that? - Shakespearean. Just so you know, I've been in films with major movie stars. Oh, I'm sure you have. But, hey, guess what? Today you're the star. Huh? Last looks, please. Is this a good place for me to sit? It's perfect, sweetheart. Come on, folks. - Let's get this show on the road. - And out of this dump. Do you not want to do this, Daisy? 'Cau se if you don't wantto do it, don't. We'll just stop what we're doing and go home. Everybody? Folks. Say the word. We'll--we'll pack it in. Come back another day, with another girl. Really, I can-- I can always get another girl. How's my lipstick? You could use a little touch-up. All right, folks, show time. Seconds away, people, seconds away. - Hi, Crystal. - Hi. Anything good in your crystal ball? "Crystal ball." There's someone waiting for you in the conference room. What do they want? It doesn't say. Hi. Ms. Hay-gen? Did I say that right? Actually, no, it's "Hagen." As in "-dazs." - I'm Mickey. - Hi, Mickey. Who are you? I run the metro south homeless shelter. Oh. That's nice. Oh, well, I check on the guys down at the fifth street encampment every few days. They told me about Montana-- about Arthur Simms, his death, and then I called the city, and that led me to you. Shit. Uh, these... these are Montana's belongings. Wow. I was... wondering where his stuff went. - Thank you, Mickey. - You're welcome. So you knew... uncle Arthur? Yeah, a little bit. I certainly didn't know he had any family. Well, we weren't a close-knit crew. You know, I always wondered why he called himself "Montana". I think Montana loved the outdoors. He was a "big sky" kind of guy, you know? I know he loved a good barbecue. You didn't know him at all, did you? We were planning on getting together. We had... scheduling issues. I always wonder how my clients end up where they do-- on the fringes, you know? And then I run into some family member who doesn't give two shits, and that's it, the mystery's solved. I give a shit. Not two. Oh, is that why the county's taking care of him? I just don't have 400 bucks lying around. Yeah, and since you left him to charity his whole life, why change now? I'm so sick of you people! Shame on you. A little heads-up on the dead, Mickey. Put them in a marble temple, stick them in a coffee can, either way, they don't care. They're dead. I'm going to hell. Or maybe I'm staying here forever. Millie, what was that? Oh, it's nothing, Delores. Just a family thing. Millie, is he asking you for money? Because my cousin, Louis, took me for a tidy sum, never paid it back, and now he lives in Ecuador with a man servant and everything-- - No, Delores, someone died. - Someone close? No, it's just the money's for his burial, and I don't have it. - How much? - $400. Well, silly, all you have to do is ask. Family emergency. That's what advances are for, Millie. I'll get a check cut for you right away. I didn't know you cared so much. Neither did I. Hey, J.D. Look who's here. I don't do preppy dogs. - Well, he's not preppy. - He is. Get him away from me. Mom! Come get J.D. Reggie, you don't need to shout. I'm right here. - Hello. - Hello. Guess you don't remember me, mrs. Lass? Oh, my god... Sandy Simons, is that you under all that eyeliner? In the flesh. Oh, I heard you moved back to town. - How's your mom? - Divorced. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Don't be. My dad's a freak. Come on, Reggie. Let's go online. So, Sandy... where did you discover this... new look? Florida. My name's "Raven" now. Nice. Mom, can you take J.D., Please? Why? Don't you want him with you? No. He's too preppy. Preppy? Fine. Do you girls want something to eat? Something sweet. Uh, do you have any charcoal? No. No, no, girls. I'm sorry, no matches. Charcoal eyeliner. I'm going to do Reggie's make-up. Oh! Sure. I'll get it. Oh, don't you worry. She needs a friend who's human. Or something close. Say it ain't so. Oh, brother. Truly stunning work, young Rembrandt. What'd you call me, asshole? Christ. I was hoping to pay tribute to your artwork. Well, I think it's shit. Always striving. Always pushing to make your work a cut above. I appreciate that in a young person. In fact, I'd love to shake your hand. Start climbing then grandpa. How about you come down? The climb up is half the experience. Falling down the other half? Maybe for you. I never fall. Ever. I want to pay you for your work. Call it art appreciation. How about, say... 30 bucks? Cash on the barrel head, if you come down in the next two minutes. You Medici motherfucker. You can't rush art. I'll make it 40. $40 for an original work by the great "B. Boyd." What the fuck? I ain't that hack, man. I'm up here blotting his shit out. What the fuck, indeed. Get the fuck out of my airspace, motherfucker, before I shoot you down! Terrible, what people do to other people's property. Shit! Heads up! Tag. You're it. B-boy! B-boy, get up, man! Get up! Damn, look at that pattern. Watch your step now. I have to say I'm a little nervous about this. There's nothing to be nervous about. I just feel like it's underhanded, filming a guy who's cheating his wife. Hey, hey, hey... his wife's the one that contacted us. She thinks this is where he comes to pick up women. Don't make me out to be the bad guy. I'm not. So how do I look? Good enough to end a marriage. Where are the cameras? There. There. There and there. - Any more questions? - No. You? Yeah. Are you sure you know how to seduce a man? I don't know. Do I? We'll see. - Everything pink goes? - Burn it. Is that her? Yeah. That's my sister. It's the only yearbook picture of her I ever found. She was too cool for that bullshit. She was never in any clubs or anything. Not being in stuff is cool. Not like my sister, president of the "my shit doesn't stink society." Can I see her room? Your order, ladies. Looks good, Reggie. Thanks. Her name's not "Reggie" anymore. Dare I ask? It's "Spider". Spider, huh? That's pretty. Um, you know, we don't have a lot of sweets in the house, but I did find these. I think those are really stale. That's okay, I like stale. It's closer to death. Well, try not to get a lot of crumbs on the floor. So, um, well, you girls, have fun. Um, would you like to ask Raven over for dinner... spider? Sure. Terrific. Can we invite a couple of friends? Of course. Yeah. Can we have pizza? Pizza it is. - Your mom's cool. - Not really. Come here much? Isn't that supposed to be a man's line? I didn't know there was a script. Want to hear my guess about you, Walter? Uh-oh... now I'm getting nervous. - Another shot of courage, my friend? - Thank you. How about you, miss? - No, I'm good. - Well, that's good to know. My guess, Walter, is that you're supposed to be at home right now, but you work a long day, and the wife isn't always a welcome face at the end of it. I should get going. You have a nice neck. It's strong. Does your wife kiss your neck, Walter? She should. Jesus. Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm making you uncomfortable. You're the kind of guy that believes in staying with somebody forever. I gave up on forever. It doesn't last. I'm a big fan of just one really good night. Are you a good kisser, Walter? Um... I don't know. I bet you would be. I'm sorry. I'm not a cheater. You're not, are you? No. Top you up there, pal? I'm fine. I'll be right back. Watch my bag? What are you doing? He doesn't want to cheat. - Really? How do you know that? - Because he said so. Men say a lot of fucking things, Daisy, all day long, but mostly at night. - Or maybe you don't know men. - I know men fine. This guy is clueless. He wants to be told what to do. He wants to be told what he wants. What does he want? He wants what we all want. He wants to feel alive. Right, Daisy? I don't know. He's not a cheater, I can see it. So what are you, a fucking marriage counselor now? - No. - No. You're an actress. Act like you want to make him happy. Act like you want to make me happy. Fine. - Am I being hard on you? - Yes. I'm an awful guy. I'm mean. I'm terrible. - You really are. - I really am. Now go out there... and show him no mercy. - All right? - Mm. All right, Millie. Here you go. $400. Thank you, Delores. For your uncle's burial. Uncle Arthur, was it? Right. The good news was I had a check for 400 bucks. The bad news was... I was thinking about keeping the money. This is a sweet thing you're doing-- working overtime to pay him tribute. That's what we do for family, I guess. I was working for it, so why should I spend it on some guy just because he's dead? I'm dead, too. Honoring the dead helps us go on living. I know. One hot leather jacket, and no one would be the wiser. The thing that's lovely about this gesture is that you're not just looking for a pat on the back. On my hot new leather jacket. Right. That's the way I feel about my kids. What kids? The little ones I sponsor. Oh! Say hello to... Kasawala. And Anjali. And... this is Ching-Zi. I saw her picture in my sunday parade, and I just couldn't resist adding one more. And this... I'm not supposed to play favorites. This is Fallanda. Isn't she beautiful? $15 a month from yours truly gets her a monthly supply of high-protein lunches, and her village gets a water pump. That's so sweet, Delores. Oh. I mean, she'll never thank me in person, but that's not what's important, as you know. Thank you, Delores Herbig, and your big, brown eyes. Right. The important thing is when life presents us with an opportunity to help someone who can't help themselves, we have to step up, and that's what you're doing right now. And just like that, I lost my hot new leather jacket. Thank you for the fine example you set. Hey... this is nice. I lost my other jacket when I died. Thank you, Georgia Lass. You're welcome. Pretty girl you were talking to. Seems nice. Oh, I don't think so. I don't think that one's so nice. Well, you never know. Wouldn't you just kill to find out, though? God, I know I would. Excuse me. Good evening, sir. What are you doing here? I've come to see Daisy act. Where are the cameras? They're hidden, and shut the fuck up. - Excuse me? - Shut the fuck up. And don't talk to her when she comes down here. Fine. The only reason you have to open your mouth is to pour booze in it. You understand? And what are we drinking to, Ray? They're both for you. - Looking good, Daisy. - Not now, Mason. I'm not going to fucking tell you again. Well, look who's still here. You asked me to watch your bag. Oh. Lucky me. I found a boy scout. Okay, go home, boy scout. You did your good deed. You know what everybody says on their deathbed, Walter? They wish they'd had more fun. And men wish they'd had more women. Five reasons men come to a bar, Walter. One... they don't love their wife anymore. Two, their wife doesn't love them. Three, they want to see what they're missing. And four, they want, if just for a moment, to taste it. Five... maybe there were just four. You want to go somewhere with me, Walter? I do. Blackstone hotel. Get us a room. I'll follow. - Now? - Now. Um, I have to pay my bar tab. No, I got it. Go the hotel, boy scout. How's that for no mercy? Jimmy, Blackstone hotel, now. I'm not going there. No, you're not, though it sure seemed like you wanted to. What the fuck was that kiss? I was just playing the part, Ray, going with it. - A little too well. - You're hurting me. Well, maybe I'm just playing the part of the jealous boyfriend. I'm sorry. See? See what you do to me? You are a hell of an actress. Thank you. Come here. - I'll see you later tonight? - Okay. Good seeing you, Mason. What was that? I was acting. Acting like what, a whore? Because it was bloody brilliant, definitive. You're drunk, Mason, and you smell. You smell. He smells. This whole bloody thing smells. Go home. I just wanted to say you were really great. Thank you. It's really nice of you to come up and tell me that. I know some people are shy about approaching actors, but it really makes my day. What's your name? Melissa. I'm his wife. - Oh. - "Oh?" That's it? That's all I get? That's all you have left? I didn't know you would be here. They didn't tell me. Okay. Let's blame them. So she's dead? I'm dead. Ready? Speak to the spirits. "Light as a feather, stiff as a board." "Light as a feather, stiff as a board." "Light as a feather, stiff as a board." Sorry to interrupt, girls. Just thought I'd bring in some sodas. Mom. That's cool, mrs. Lass. Thanks. Would you like to play a game with us? - No way. - What are you playing? Nothing. Reggie... chill out. Your mom is cool. Um, why don't you girls levitate without me? "Light as a feather, stiff as a board." Wow. Aren't you... - I mean... - Aren't I what? You look good. Thank you. I'm going to go take a peek. If she sees you, she'll freak. Thanks for inviting me. If you get caught, I know nothing. So what exactly is "goth"? Dad! You're not supposed to be here. No boys allowed. - Reggie? - What? We're eating in the living room. Uh, Reggie-- I think the greasy food should stay in the kitchen. Mom, don't embarrass me. Dad, get out! What the hell, Joy? A few simple sacrifices to the devil, followed by pizza. I'm not comfortable with this. - It's harmless, all right? A phase. - How do you know that? I'm not in love with it, but it's an actual party, Clancy. With actual friends. Reggie has friends? Reggie has friends. Wow. Look who's back. Still panning for gold in dry gulch? No. So what's the sad story this time? I think you'll like this one. Once upon a time, there were these four guys named Benjamin, and they could have turned into a nice leather jacket, but instead, they ended up on your crummy desk. I thought Arthur Simms didn't have a family. He does now. Complicated guy. Can I just have a receipt, please? One second. Nice frog. That's general Tsao. And this... is Arthur Simms. You're shitting me? What'd you think you were getting for $400? A grave. A headstone. The city hasn't had funerals for transients for years. We burn them. - There's a landfillover by the freeway-- - Yeah, I get it. No, no, no, no. You paid for them, they're yours. What the fuck do I want them for? Ashes have many uses. All kinds of things you can do with people. Don't try to play creepy death guy with me. I see death all the time. Well, you may see death all the time, sweetheart, but you obviously don't know what to do with it. And this one's yours. All right. Fine. Not very heavy for a whole dead guy. Ashes to ashes. But you know all about that, don't you? - You have no idea. - Mm. - Okay, so tell me the rules. - Yeah, me too. We'll just go around the circle until you get it, then you can join in. Don't embarrass me. Tabitha... go. Overdose. - Of what? - Aspirin. Boring. Okay, wait. Boiling oil. Boiling acid. Electrocution. Decapitation. Flaying. Brain embolism. Carpal tunnel. - What's that? - It's really, really bad. Okay. Mrs. Lass? Um, well... in my sleep, age 98, surrounded by flowers... and grandchildren... and all the people I love. Jesus, mom, that's not how you play the game. Well, that's my answer. That's okay, Reggie. You go. Okay... I'm killed... by a toilet seat that falls from a space station, and I'm blown to bits. Wow. Okay, party's over. Time to go. But my mom can't pick me up until later. Too bad. I said it's time to go. Mom. Come on, girls. Let's call your parents. Mrs. Lass, I totally think you're overreacting. Sandy, I think you need to go upstairs and get your things and go home, and put some cold cream on your face, and follow it up with some astringent. 'Cause that pancake makeup is going to destroy your skin. You don't want to get acne scars. So mean! Thanks a lot. Your sister's death is not a game. Whatever. I'm sorry, Reggie, but I'm not comfortable-- Who's that? Say hello to Arthur Simms. - He's had quite a day. - Yeah. Hey, Kiff. - Coffee? - No, I'm good. - Is that someone's ashes? - No. No way. Don't put someone's ashes on my table. It's bad luck. He woke up this morning life-size... now look at him. No headstone. No nothing. You don't need a headstone if nobody's going to come to see it. - Are those ashes? - Yes. I was cremated, you know. - You burned to death. - That's what I just said. Gone with the wind... on gone with the wind. I didn't find that funny. I did. How'd your big day go? Perfect. I nailed every scene. Really? Apparently, I'm a very gifted actress. Really? Ask Mason. He was there. - What's that? - Arthur Simms. Who's that? Uncle Arthur. Uncle Arthur! You've lost weight. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. So, Mason, was Daisy a good actress? Yes, she is. Thank you. Always has been, it turns out. My eyes have been opened. My ears have heard that which they thought they never would. All right, Mason. Well, little miss movie star, we finally got someone that's somebody. Mm. Yes, I am. And that somebody should pick up the check. Uh, Roxy? Can you do me one more big favor? I'm not going anywhere with that dead man. It's a health code violation. Circle of life, right? Okay, but you have to go on my shift with me. - And he seats on the back seat. - That's fine. - Congratulations, Daisy. - Thank you. You keep doing that, you know. - What? - Fixing your face. A girl's got to look good for her man. That man grabbed you by the arm, Daisy. I don't think I care for him much. What you don't care for is that he's dating me. I'd really appreciate it if you'd be civilized when he shows up. He's coming here? Yep. Of course. Rube wouldn't like that. You're right. Rube wouldn't like that, but he's not here, and you still are. You're so beautiful. And I love you. I just don't like you anymore. In a lifetime, we get to be many things. Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief... doctor, lawyer, indian chief. Daughter, sister, scout, college dropout, friend, dead girl... Or maybe we just play the parts for a couple of hours until the curtain falls. From the moment I met him, I knew something about Arthur Simms was familiar. I understood wanting to disappear. I wanted to my whole life. And then I did. Okay, Arthur Simms, here you go. You lived, and then you died. You have not been forgotten. I could use some breakfast. You hungry? I could eat. Feels like an oatmeal morning. Maybe I'll try something different today. You should. It's a big menu. Hmm...
