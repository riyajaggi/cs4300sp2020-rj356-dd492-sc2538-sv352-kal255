 Go to bed! I dreamt I fell asleep at the wheel. How can you sleep sitting down? 3 years' practice at school. - Good evening. - Evening. No sleeping! - We weren't sleeping. - We're waiting for a friend. Here? At 3am? - Yes. - Yep. - Mind you... - Wait a bit. We'll wait a bit longer.

 Beat it or I'll fine you. Will it cost less than a hotel? We won't park in front of the restaurant. I'm not ready to let it go yet. We'll come back in a bit. Start, start! Ah, thanks. I can't believe you slept in your car for 3 days. I'm a friend, aren't I? What are friends for? We'll stay 1 night. Mi casa es su casa. A bed, at last! I told you: every problem has a solution. Oh, my God... How does she do it?

 He can't be that good. It's impossible. Go on, come. Come. Come... Come... Patrick. Patrick! - Patrick! - What? What's wrong? She must've been screaming for an hour! OK. I understand. And you fancy some, eh? - We're leaving! - OK. "Bedsit, no heating, crooked floor, "over Chinese shop. Spring roll smell." - Serious? - I'm reading between the lines. We can't even afford a slum. We'll become tramps. What am I saying? We are tramps! We just need to find a booze shop to sit outside. - Stop it. - It'll happen. We're not alone. I'm not going back to Mr Macho's! Your parents. If we explain, they could lend us... I'd rather be run over by a truck. - Look. - What? - Over there. - Quick! Who's doing it? Stone, paper... - Yes! - Shit! Go! Hey, my pizza! It's my mum. - Forget your mum! Go! - OK! OK! Karine, it's Mummy. I've been trying to get you for a few days. The bank called me: your restaurant hasn't made the last few payments. Probably just a mistake, but call me to clear it up. Think of your father. Let's not worry him. Monique! Monique. I've found a brilliant app! Check this out. You can follow our journey from the moment we leave the house right until we reach our hotel in Cuba, in real time. So what? Well, it... it means you know exactly where you are in real time. It's time you played with real humans in Cuba: you're on the computer far too much. OK. I've another app that translates French into Spanish. Say any word: the app gives you the translation. Oatmeal. Who wants to know the translation for "oatmeal"? Avena. Avena! Amazing, eh? - Really? - Yes! Hey, beautiful, I'll buy you a coffee. I stole some change off Sylvain. You stole money from Sylvain? Come on, baby. Don't cry. It's just some change. We're now stealing money off your mate to buy coffee! No, it's not "stealing". Just look at it as... as a loan... a long-term loan we didn't tell him about. You didn't flip when we stole pizza. It's different! How much d'you have? About 20 dollars. What're you doing? I have to buy tampons. That's why you're moo... er... a sweet Moomin who wants to go sleepies all the time. Buy as many tampons as you like. Money's no object. Size, quantity, wings... the full monty. Go for it! Mummy? Stéphanie, honey! Have you heard from your sister? When has Karine ever called me? What sun cream do you want? Factor 60 for me, 15 for Dad. Perfect. I'll pick you up at midday. OK. Thanks, darling. Bye. Karine! - Hi. - Stéphanie, what a coincidence! You're in town and you didn't call me! That's not nice. I left 3 or 4 messages, but you never called back. Well, yes... We're so busy at the restaurant... I don't have time to wash. What're you doing? This... It's awkward. - Patrick has problems... - No. No, he doesn't. How about you? I'm buying sun cream for Mum and Dad. - They're off to Cuba for a week. - Ah yes... Mum may've mentioned it but we're so busy at the restaurant that I must've forgotten. Restaurant going OK? Really good. Turning folk away. If you need... Why do people ask me if I need help? I'm a big girl. I meant, if you need to talk to Mum and Dad before they go, the flight's at 3pm. OK... Guess what just happened? Bad luck. I ran into my sister. She quizzed me. Good news: my parents are off to Cuba for a week! - They've invited us! - No! The house is empty. Alright! Yeah! Bungalow City, here we come! Your period must be pretty heavy. A lounge! With a leather sofa! And a plasma TV! Oh yes... A kitchen! - A fridge. - Yes! With... a nice bottle of white! Through there... What is it? A shower! With hot water! - A king-size bed! - A bed! - Did it go "crack"? - Don't worry. Delicious. You're the world's best chef. The restaurant would've been a success without the roadworks. Let's move on, eh? We tried, it didn't work. How about we find a better location, city centre... That costs an arm and a leg and we don't have any arms left. My arms are big enough for two, my love. My love, I've got something to tell you. I'm not sure you'll think it's good news. After the shitty weeks we've had, it'll have to be serious to make me cave in. It is. Seriously serious. Yeah... Come on, shoot! Bring on the bad news! Now I'm bust, nothing upsets me. "Bust"? What's he doing, naked in my bedroom? Eh? There's a hurricane in Cuba. The flight's cancelled. That smells good in the kitchen. What is it? Tarragon? What... is it? Basil. You borrowed $80,000 from your mother? You lent them $80,000 without telling me? As they can't pay it back... - Temporarily. - We were unlucky. I owe their 80,000 to the bank? We'll pay you back. We'll make it up at a better site. So, when do you expect to pay it back? It's hard to give an exact date. And you didn't think it might be worth consulting me before financing his bloody white elephant project? You'd have said "no". Yes! Dirty cheapskate that I am! It would've been just like me to say "no" to his restaurant project in a district nobody goes to! Look what might've happened! Can I just say that it wasn't just my white elephant? It was our white elephant. No. It was your idea, your dream! It was never Karine's dream! She can't even make a toastie! She did it out of love: incomprehensible! No, she can't make toasties. Remember the time she... Stéphanie, stop! We'll find work and pay you back. Is that true what your mother says? You wanted our eatery. OK, OK... No. You're just doubtful because the dream turned into a nightmare. At the start, you loved it. You'd have said if you didn't like it? It seemed so important to you. You talked about it endlessly. Cooking is your life and I had no better ideas. So I got on board, but I... I was alone on the ship all that time? No! I was there! I just wasn't into it... - My God! - I wasn't into it, but... I thought we knew each other! Serves you right, Lussier! - Could've told me. - What difference would it make? What difference would it make telling you? A little girl who only worked 1 summer selling clothes before marrying a rich guy! Which of your business-savvy qualities should I have called on? I don't know, Karine. If you'd told me, I could've said something like: "Stay with us." You're right: who'd confide in a suburban idiot who stays home to look after her kid? What's it to me that my sister is in trouble? Why should I care I'm going to be an auntie? What? Rewind. - He didn't know? - No, he didn't. This isn't about bankruptcy? - No. - Who's going to be an aunt? Thanks for keeping me informed. I'd started to tell you. Patrick! - I'm sorry... - What? Now you want to talk, eh? I didn't say right away: I'm not sure! What didn't you say? That you borrowed money off your folks or that you're pregnant? I'm slow. You gotta tell me things slowly! You never understood accounting! You don't seem to understand much either! After 3 months of roadworks outside, serving 4 customers a week, we'd had it! A kid of 4 would've realised! Let me get this straight: I'm going to be a granddad again and I owe 80,000? I don't know! I'm too stupid! Ask Karine! Email me if it's a boy or a girl. You can sleep here in the meantime. I'll pay every last cent back. You bet you will! Pierre! Shouldn't we tell her off just a bit? How come you're granting loans without telling me? Don't blame me! We're talking about Karine! I'm not pregnant. You sure? I did the test 3 times. That's the first bit of good news all week. When you give me a child, we'll do it right. He'll be wanted, not just some problem that we have to deal with. I don't want his 1st bed to be a car or a sofa in Sylvain's shag palace. I can give you babies. Just tell me when. I didn't tell you about the finances because I thought it would work out. I didn't want you to be unhappy. How could I be, when you're here? Come here. I love you. I love you more. We'll get through, I promise. We accept my folks' offer: we'll stay 3 days, till we sort ourselves out. 1 week max. 2 weeks worst case, till we find a job. 3 weeks tops, till we get paid, find a flat... Go before my birthday. I'm not turning 35 at Pierre and Monique's: we'll look like real losers... We'll never be there then. Worst case scenario, we go before Christmas. Deal? Deal. So... you live with your parents, do you? Yes. In a superb storeroom, that smells musty. - Yeah? Next to the washing machine. My parents keep the toilet paper... No. That fantasy won't work for me. It doesn't work for me! Shall we go? Yes. But first, I have something to sort out. - Unhook it. - I've got it, I've got it! Shit, the police! Go, go, go! What're you doing! Stop! - Morning. - Hi, Dad. Morning, Pierre. Subtitles: Eclair Media
