 Don't leave me alone with your pa. I'm meeting Richard's friend for a job. I can't stop your silences with Pa. Call those "silences"? He and I have raised awkwardness to an art form. I'm sorry, but I'd rather spend a day in a blender than 5 minutes with him. I tried to talk about the weather, golf, retirement, but I get nothing! I hit a ball to him, but it never comes back.

 It's like playing tennis at both ends at the same time. It's tiring. He answers questions I don't even ask myself. Did you know that there are clouds that travel at 125mph in the sky? I ain't even hungry. My parting's receding today. Oh well. Every day, a new parting. Watch the football with him. It's a guy thing. He loves it. You can say something smart about the game. Any silences, just watch the game. Wanna dance? No, I do not.

 Right. Ready for your interview? Updated your CV? Did you thank your brother-in-law for setting up the meeting with Jean-Charles? Do you know how to present your bankruptcy as a wise decision? Please don't pressure me. What about my cream blouse? Mind you, your rebel look is cute, for a 35-year-old. 34. I'm not wearing your clothes to an interview. Don't bite your nails. Coffee, father-in-law? I'm not deaf, and please use my name. This isn't the Pays d'en Haut, son-in-law! Come with me: your nail varnish is flaking off. You must make a good impression. Jean-Charles runs a charity for kids: I'd be surprised if my varnish is a priority! You're right, we'll remove it... Don't be long! It might get cold. I told Jean-Charles that your sister was... unique. But she mustn't say she worked on a sex chatline to break the ice, if she wants the job. We have a child here. Exotic. Exotic chatline, I said. Jeanne? She only did that for 2 weeks. Don't talk about her like she's a moron. She's had 6,000 jobs in the last 5 years, she's bankrupt and she's going out with a loser. Anyway, you criticise her loads as well. I'm allowed to, she's my sister. - Aren't you late for golf? - 10 minutes. Hey! You're late for golf. Well, look at that, I am late for golf. Is that the "No sex for you tonight" look? No, "No sex for you this week". You're not coming to Stephanie's! My mum at an interview! It's a meeting. In order to secure a job. I'm going to see Jeanne. Just admit you want to keep an eye on me. You're paranoid, Karine. You think I'll mess up! It's so obvious! I'll give you a lift, say hi to Jeanne and go shopping. If it bothers you... always thinking the worst of me! OK, thanks for the lift, Mum. No. Hey! "It's OK. "Jeanne will ask you to stay for lunch, as planned." I know these big shots. - No. - I'll keep quiet. - No! - If that's what you want. That is what I want! When will you be back? At the time I told you the 4 times you asked. I'll call you. Yes, call me. Hurry back. It's your choice. OK, bye. Wish me luck. Good luck. You don't need luck. You're the guy's early Xmas gift. - Hurry back. - OK. Karine! Enjoy the game! We'll wait for you here. Us guys... Big football game, eh, Pete? Not "Pete", Pierre. Call if you want me to go shopping. D'you want me to drive? I should've gone with them. Right... OK... Granny, I want you to stay for lunch! Sweetie... It's OK, Auntie Karine knows what's going on. Yeah. - She read your text. - Jeanne. Come here, my favourite niece in the whole world. I'm your only niece. I could have 1,000, but I don't want any others. - Love yours. - Lovely top. Thank you. - Casual. - It's new, eh? Yes. It does up behind, but it was too hard. I need a maid. It's a miracle I'm not in a psychiatric hospital. - What? - Nothing, sweetie. But never forget: in small quantities, mess, creases and dust are healthy. Another great sunny day. Eh, Pierre? Nice and sunny. Zero clouds. Big, clear blue sky. The kind of sky you make postcards with. With which you make postcards. The kind of sky "with which" you make postcards. Bloody French... Beautiful, but complicated. Had I had 10 cents every time... If I'd had 10 cents. Yeah. Yeah, that's how the joke goes. The dishwasher's a great invention. Eh, Pierre? I don't know what we'd have done without ours. You don't need to wonder about that now. Oh yeah... Because we went bankrupt. About the management training... You really interested? Yes. If I had to choose between management classes and sticking nails under my nails... I'll go and warm up the TV. - I'll take your things. - Thanks. What did we say, Mum? He's coming in half an hour. Can't I have 5 minutes to talk to my daughter? I'll time you. FYI, Richard told Jean-Charles your boyfriend went bankrupt. Good idea. Why? I was the owner too. Sweetheart, bankruptcy is nothing to be proud of. Neither is lying. You spent 4 days in your car before admitting you'd gone bust: you can't lecture me about lying. It's not a total lie: the restaurant was more his than yours. You're not really lying, you're... offering part of the truth. It looks better. We know how important it is to look good, eh? Well, yes. Wasn't he coming at half-past? Thereabouts, he said. Go, Mum! No. I'll say hello. One has to be civilised. 1st down and 10 for Montreal. That's how you play! High five, bro! No. I don't "high five". I'm not your bro, either. It's just an expression. Come on, Pierre. It's just chat. I know that. Can't we just watch the game quietly? Good pass... No, no... Let's see... Come on! No way! Not the cable! No way! No! Not now! Stephanie said you care about social welfare. Yes. Social welfare is very important, to me. Social welfare? Karine's another Mother Teresa. It's true. We had to watch her as a child: she gave all her toys to the neighbours. Did Stephanie tell you what our foundation does? Yes, yes. We organise holiday camps for disadvantaged children. We take kids who've never left their street fishing for the 1st time. Karine adores children. Adores them. It's true, I adore children. Karine, look at my scrapbook! I had to write about my favourite person. I chose you, Auntie Karine. You're so sweet, Jeanne. We'll look at it later, but I have to talk to your daddy's friend. OK? - Mummy, weren't you leaving? - No. Didn't you have something on? Look, you at my christening. Beautiful! If it had been up to her, she'd have half a dozen kids. Unfortunately, her husband's sterile. No, Mummy... I added a picture: that's you when you did the exotic phone calls. "Exotic"? A misunderstanding. It's not... That's you, me and my birthday cake. Yes, it's your birthday soon. I won't miss that! It was last month. "It was last month"? Last month? Same date each year, Karine. Stephanie, Mum, Jeanne, why don't we go get... some water from the kitchen? Eh? OK? Let's go! Are you totally nuts? Why tell him my boyfriend's sterile? And don't apologise for my mistakes! I went bust, it's my life. You wanna help me? Thank you. But if it's to make me feel awkward, don't bother: I can do that on my own! - But... - OK. Ssh! I'll finish telling you off later on: I have a job to get. But... What bloody idiot put this in? There are more wires than holes! The "bloody idiot" was me. Strike two... That's it, give it a good whack: that'll help! What was that? I'll go and get a hammer: you might as well just smash it up! I suppose staring at wires really helps? Are you trying to untangle them or hypnotise them? OK, fine. You don't like me. Let's not force things. I get it. I've given up trying! - Good! - For sure! - About time! - You bet! If I follow this wire, will I get to this? No. Are you sure? I know my TV. You've got time to kill. My man's not sterile. I forgot Jeanne's birthday. I'm a bad godmother. It's because I've just gone bankrupt and that's been on my mind lately. I'm looking for a fundraiser. Liking kids is not a must. But don't worry, your sister said such good things about you, I'm offering you a partnership, not a job. My sister said good things? Apparently, you're a gift from heaven. Stephanie said that? Listen, it's an exciting job: fulfilling, demanding, but not that well-paid. All that I need to hear is "fulfilling" and "exciting". OK. Shall we start again? Finished yet? We'll miss the 2nd half! I've finished: I'm just making it last because it's such fun! You shouting at me really helps. It would help if you shined the torch here rather than just hold it. If I want to be told off, I'll ring my wife. If I want a sulker, I'll ring Karine. You think Karine sulks? You don't know what "sulking" is until you've seen her mother do it. Karine sulked for a week over anti-cellulite cream. 125 dollars for 1 bloody pot. You'd expect... I dunno, a "thank you", maybe. OK... See the 80,000 I owe because of you: well, Monique is sulking because I should've stopped her giving you a loan, yet she did it behind my back because I'd have refused! That's heavy. Wait. Karine was angry with me for 2 days because I was angry with her. - She did that when she was 3. - Yeah? You'd tell her to pick up her toys, she'd scold you because you scolded her. Then her mother scolded her for scolding me and Karine scolded her mother for scolding me. I'm stubborn. I'm not scared to muck in. The work you do really touches my heart. You change children's lives. I'd be proud to work for a charity like yours. Well... You won't regret this! Well, at least we have 1 thing in common. We love our women. She can be difficult, but I wouldn't want anyone else. I'd crawl miles to make her laugh. When Karine laughs, it makes life worth living. Anyway, if they're not difficult, they're boring. Don't you agree? I'm not being biased, but the Bernier women are top quality. And what a body! - Hang on... - Too much info. OK, rewind. Yes! This calls for a beer! Eh, son-in-law? Just one? I didn't imagine Stephanie having a sister like you. - What d'you mean? - Listen, I adore Steph. She's lovely. She and my wife get on like sisters. So... But she's not the sharpest knife in the drawer. And don't worry about your mum. Mine's totally menopausal as well, but I've learnt to block her out. The minute she opens her mouth, all I can hear is static. When can you start? If... you don't need anything else, we'll leave you to talk. I'll take Jeanne out. No need to. I think I've found my gem. You won't regret it! You won't find anyone better. We were talking start dates. She can start right away! Eh, love? In fact, I... I'll think it over. - What? - Think what over? But I need an answer soon. - She'll take it. - She's keen. I've thought it over: "Fuck you very much!" I'll keep on looking. D'you know how hard I twisted Richard's arm to get this meeting? I'd rather be skint than work for a chauvinist who thinks you're dumb and you're hysterical. Excuse me. Jean-Charles, it was a pleasure. What you doing? Nothing. How much have you drunk? You wanted us to find common ground. You can't do that on an empty stomach. Eh, Pat? Hell, no! "Pat"? What common ground did you find? I'll go and get us one. Or else, it's gonna be a long night. - Put it on a coaster. - Take your foot off. She didn't say when she'd be back? That answers my 3rd question: are you still angry, Monique? - Baby... - We need to talk! - What? - Shut up! - You said we needed to talk. - Get him! Subtitles: Eclair Media
