 You OK? - Scary. - What? I dreamt that we'd lost everything and had to ask my parents if we could sleep in their basement. And then, it got really horrible... Oh no... Oh no... Boomerang You're great: half of the city's restaurants

 would beg to have you. How about giving out some CVs? You haven't given out any CVs either. We have CVs? No, we don't. I need to change industry. I can't run a restaurant. I'm rubbish with numbers. No, you're great. As good as a solar calculator at night. You're better than me. I'm trying to say I'm thinking about my future and finding it hard because this hamster in my head keeps saying: "We need cash."

 Listen, listen... Don't get upset. Your parents aren't broke. It's not as if they need that money to live. OK. Let's say we pay back 20 dollars a week: that's something. - True. 20 dollars a week. - Yes. That's... We owe 80,000! At 20 dollars a week, it'll take us 4,000 weeks! And that's... What is that? Oh my God! That's 77 years! Good! See, you're great with numbers. 77... - We'll die in this basement. - Of course not... - We won't. - They'll bury us here. We'll be old, but we won't die here. I'm scared. Here you go. Thank you. - Morning. - Hi, Dad. Morning, Pierre. - Enjoy, son. - Thanks, Pierre. Right. I've just done a massive shop. The 2nd massive shop of the week. There's a black hole in the fridge and larder. Food's disappearing, vanishing mysteriously, as if into another dimension. I'll take this. I'm not hungry. I'll keep this for tomorrow. Good idea. The whole of Quebec saw me win Kitchen Stars. Can you see me flipping burgers in a fast-food joint? It's humiliating. No one remembers you. See our viewing figures? We almost beat The Voice. Come here, babe. Look at my mate. Morning, babe. - What? What is it? - Recognise him? No... Don't tell me I slept with him. No. That's him. I'll give you a clue: he was on TV. OK... Not in Loft Story, for sure. Did you audition for The Voice? See? No need to worry, you're in the hall of fame for bygones, with Claude Steben and Daniel Hétu. Check this out! Yes, it's great! See you at the gym later? I've designed a new work-out for you tonight. I'm glad I inspire you. BANKRUPT Bye. You got a paper bag I could put on my head? Thanks. Your boyfriend hasn't washed up at all yet. It's an unwritten law in cookery: great chefs don't wash up. What about my dishes, though? - I need to ask something. - What? What did I say I wanted to be when I grew up? Most of the time, you said: the Tooth Fairy. No, but when you asked me what job I wanted to do. The Tooth Fairy. - Want me to dry? - Yes. Dad, do you remember what I used to want to be when I grew up? You always said you wanted to be Prime Minister of Canada. Really? With my talent, I could be Finance Minister. If I went into deficit, it would be normal. It's a law of nature. When you keep having bad luck, it has to change. We're due a change, I feel it. 20 dollars! It's starting! Lady Luck's on my side. Plus 20, plus 30, plus 10, plus 5. That's it. 85 dollars. Good. It's a start. Since I bought you 100 dollars worth, you owe me 15 dollars. Can I start a tab? - Why not answer? - Unknown caller. Good news maybe. Or a murderous creditor. He can't kill you over the phone. - Yes? - Patrick Lussier? It depends. I have an offer you can't refuse. Meet me in 1 hour outside your restaurant. Someone who wants to help. See! Lady Luck is smiling on you! OK, stop... That's enough! "Closed down". Nice name for a restaurant. Miguel Constantino. Was that you who rang? Proof that you shouldn't have won Kitchen Stars. Your gratin dauphinois with maple syrup was awful compared to mine. Your octopus was so rank, sharks wouldn't eat it! Hear about your flank steak? The judges are still chewing on it. If you're so gifted, why'd you go bust, fatso? If you just wanted to insult me, you could've done it on the phone. Wait a minute. Don't go. D'you want to hear my offer? I just opened a restaurant. I want you to work for me. I hope you can afford me: half of the restaurants in town want me as their chef. I'll pay you right. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. OK. One condition: I do it my way, don't tell me what to do. OK. Deal? Stéphanie? It's Mummy. Could you ask Karine to babysit this afternoon? Why? I don't need a nanny. It'll be super. You can go shopping, to the cinema... Karine, your sister's rung! What? I didn't say "yes"! She needs to get out, feel useful. Ah, you want rid of her, right? - Hello, Steph. Hi, Karine. How are you? Nigh on depressed. You? I have to go out this afternoon. Could you look after Jeanne, please? "Look after Jeanne"? I'd love to. OK. 1pm at our place? - Excellent. - Excellent. Stéphanie wants me to babysit. She's crazy. Hello! I'm here! Steph told me about the bankruptcy. I've got money, you know. I'm... loaded. It'd be easy for me to hand you a fat sum to help you out, but... know what? That wouldn't help you. Understand? Yes. There we go. Good luck. Have a nice day. - Karine. - Yes. Here's a list of things to do if Jeanne gets bored. OK. "Games on the tablet", "take photos with tablet", "watch films on tablet". - Where is it? - Jeanne has it. Right. - Great! - OK? How sweet! I'm off. It'll be fine. Have fun. Yes. OK. Bye. Right then... So, what're you going to do when you grow up? Computers? When I'm big, I wanna have a restaurant like you. Good luck. - Forgot something? - No. I wanted to see if you were OK. You just went out! Don't you trust me? Not totally. Steph, I babysat when I was a teenager. Yes... That's just it. You were rubbish. "Rubbish"? You were never asked back a 2nd time. I don't want to upset you, but once, the kids called their parents to come home earlier. How d'you know? They called me after they'd sacked you. I'll go and lie on the road and get run over. No, no... Stay. Spend the afternoon with me. I could pay you. You'll be babysitting my daughter and me. It ain't luxury, but it's a start. I want this place to be the best. That's why I need a great team. Can I try it? Be my guest. That's OK. You've still got it. I told you, I'm the best. I'll show you your work station. I'll let you do things your way. You can start with the plates, glasses or cutlery, it's up to you. You're not joking? Nope. D'you think I'll dip even a finger in your washing-up, Constantino? OK. To prove how serious I am, I'm willing to pay you 1,000 dollars. Just for the pleasure of watching you do it. Pathetic: I'm 35 and I don't know what to do in life. Do what my mum does. What? Your mum does nothing. What? Between you and me, it's not... You think I do nothing? I do loads. I look after the house, my child, I cook, do the laundry, cleaning, etc. Excuse me, I didn't mean... I just don't see myself staying at home. In any case, I don't have a home and my man doesn't earn a penny. Your man is some sort of kitchen star, isn't he? He could easily work in a top restaurant. He may be a big star, but we still went bust. Come on, Karine. We both know it wasn't his fault. Are you telling me it was my fault? Maths was always your weak subject. What made you think you could run a restaurant? That's scary talk: it's as if I had no talent! Of course not... You have talent. You have plenty. You're... Yes? 1 tub of ice cream Hi, babe. Your parents? They're asleep or dying of shame because of me. Why? I have a little something that will please everyone! - My God! How much? - 1,000 beauties. How'd you make so much in 1 day? When you want a quality chef, you have to be prepared to pay! What's going on? Look, Dad. Know what this is? 1,000 lovely dollars for you. Cool, eh? How did he earn that in 1 day? What are you implying? That my man is dishonest? Did he sell his body? If he sold it by the kilo, it's a bad deal. That's it, laugh! Patrick's a great chef. Lots of people would pay a fortune for him. At 1,000 dollars a day, we'll soon destroy your stupid, bloody thermometer! "1,000 dollars a day"? You've finally found a job? Well... I'm in such deep shit. They think I'll bring home 1,000 dollars a day. What're you gonna do? Go back to the scratch cards! Hey! You're washing up on YouTube! The dirty bastard! Stéphanie. Karine! What're you doing here? I've come to babysit. You're going to babysit? Cool! You were right, Steph. Pat's found a great job that pays well too! Why babysit, then? Pat's earning big bucks, so I thought my talent might lie in the home. You making a baby? Yeah, no... Not quite. But I thought that looking after you all day would be like doing work experience. - Get it? - You'll definitely be great! What are you doing? Imitate a horse. I'm not very good at animals. My mum uses kitchen roll to wipe that up, then a sponge. Kids should pick toys up when they leave them lying about. - Think I'm picking that up? - Yes. Sorry, Karine. You took 'em out, you put 'em away. What're you doing? My CV. I'm looking for a real job. Good. So, Patrick, can I add 1,000 dollars to my stupid, bloody thermometer today? Well, lookie here... 100 dollars. A small wage decrease. Cool it a sec. I borrowed that 100 dollars from yesterday's 1,000. How come? - I'm not on a wage. - You were fired? Worse. Key in "Patrick Lussier" on YouTube. Patrick "Star Chef" Lussier doing my washing-up! You do wash up? Don't laugh. It's like a video of Patrick naked... Stop it! I don't want that image in my head! My God! Who did this? We must do something. Guess. - Who? - Miguel Constantino. Really, Mum? - What you doing? - Opening it. Wait. See how clean it is? Watch me carefully. To start: 1 out-of-date trout. Steak tartare seasoned with hair from the shower and toenail clippings. And to finish: an everlasting foam fountain. Kitchen Stars Don't leave me alone with your pa. I'm meeting Richard's friend for a job. I can't stop your silences with Pa. Call those "silences"? He and I have raised awkwardness to an art form. My parting's receding today. Every day, a new parting. Subtitles: Eclair Media
