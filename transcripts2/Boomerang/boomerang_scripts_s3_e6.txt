 Marc-André, I'm not gay. I never have been. I lied to get the job, but I can't do this anymore. I'm heterosexual. I'm sorry for lying to you. If you say it like that, he'll rip your head off. Do you have to tell him today? I promised Karine I'd do it right away. Okay. Wait! Maybe... Marc-André, I'm taking some strong medication which affects--

 No! Marc-André, you misunderstood. I never told you I was gay. You didn't let me finish. I wanted to say that I'm Gaétan. -"Gaétan"? -Gaétan. Gaétan is my second name. -It's not good. -Terrible. How do I do it? How do I tell him? Do I say that I'm curious, that I want to try and play for the other team? I lied to his face to sell pulled pork. He's right, he's gonna rip my head off.

 Wait. Discover your hetero feelings in front of him. Okay. It's new, you don't know what's going on. He won't know you lied. At 35, you found out that you're heterosexual. It happens! Of course. What if I turned you? That's good. -That's good! -Yes! Great! HEY! HOW'S IT GOING? WE SHOULD GO OUT SOME TIME. YES. I NEED TO SEE YOU. Yes! Yes! Yes! WE NEED TO TALK. Have you... ever been attracted to someone from the other side? A guy from the south side? No, I mean someone from the other team. You know, there's the team we like, and there's the other team. Soccer? No! Girls! Have you been attracted to a girl? -Oh, that team! -Yes. You know Karine. She just declared her love for me. -Oh, boy. -Yes. And I'm interested. It's weird because she's a girl, and I've always been gay. Really gay. Yeah, okay. So I'm... I'll show you. Look how beautiful she is. She'd make anyone turn, right? Her nose looks like a potato. And her eyes. Looks like she hasn't slept since 1997. And seriously, her colorist... People go to prison for less. Fine. I get it. She could be Madonna, it doesn't matter. -You're gay, Patrick. -I know. So tell her. I'm worried about your mother. After every interview, she's even more depressed than the previous one. She doesn't seem herself. No. Can you stay with her? -She's a bit dull. -Yes, but-- I'll handle it. Don't worry. Mom. Come sit down. Mom? Even I have been tempted by a woman. Good! So it's not totally crazy. 1991, in my parents' basement, I came across Mitsou's music video. You know it? The one with the chair. With the chair, yes! So it could happen again? I don't think so. When you're gay, you're gay. -But... -Yes? After two Campari Sodas... See you later. Yeah, see you later. -When will you get here? -How's it going? I'm treading carefully. -I'll talk to Mom, then I'll leave. -Good. Be sexy. Everybody should be turned on. You need to smell like sex-- Sesame! Sesame! -Patrick... -The only thing I forgot to buy. Hi, Pierre. Your dad's here. I don't want to show up in the gay quarter dressed like a bitch in heat. Babe, you're our only hope. 1991, Marc-André's parents' basement. He's been tempted by a girl. If you can turn him on, he'll be understanding. I sent you a video. Put on that dress that makes your ass-- Are you sure we need sesame? -We've got loads. -See you later. Maybe you're mistaken? -You okay, Mom? -Great, thanks. Dad said you're going through... a bit of a tough time. That's in the past. I'm taking my mind off it. This is for you, Richard. It's difficult, losing your job at your age... even though you're entirely capable. It can't be easy, but I think the key isn't revenge. -"The key"? -Yes. The key. It has to come from inside. Look inside and find... -The key. -The key! The key! -When I said, "the key"... -The office key. When he slammed the door in my face, he forgot to ask for the office key. My girl, you're a brilliant life coach. You helped me to find the key. Sylvain, I-- -Stéphanie-- -Well. I know things have been tense between us, and I realized that it's my fault. I couldn't show you... how I feel about you. So... I couldn't be clearer. -Stéphanie, will you-- -No. Stand up. Stand up. I don't know when we stopped understanding each other. It's my turn to be clear. I don't love you. I'm not in love with you. I don't want to be with you. The sex is great. It's really great. But... that's all it was. I can't see you anymore. It's over. Okay? Okay. That's clear. Look after yourself. My boobs are out, nobody's looking. Trust me, babe. Being the only straight man around, you look hot. It will work. Marc-André! Look who it is! Marc-André! Hello, Marc-André! Come here, son of a gun! You've already met Karine. Yes. Oh, my God. -The school friend. -Hi. Come and have a seat. Have a drink with us. Sit down. Isn't it nice today? Would you like a drink? Oh, boy. Did someone just turn up the heat? Why are you here? Enjoying the nice weather, sitting quietly... on a terrace. Marc-André... Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me. Yes, tell her, tell her! What am I going to do with you? -I need to go back to the office. -No! Marc-André, you just... Stay a bit longer. Marc-André! He's had feelings for a woman? It's been a few years. Flirting with a gay man is perfect for losing your self-esteem. I'm sorry, babe. Bad idea. I've done all I can. You need to tell him the truth. Go on! Patrick, go! Marc-André! Wait! I've got something to tell you. I have a confession to make. To you, and everyone else. You've all made me feel so welcome and part of the family, I owe you this. I'm not and I never have been... I'm not and I never have been... I've never been so in love as I am right now. Who with? This woman right here! Yes! A woman! It's overwhelming, as all my life, I've been gay. I loved being gay. Being gay was my whole life. -It was my entire... -We get it. But I need to confess that I love someone from the other side. Not the other side of the river, but an extraordinary woman who has secretly loved me for years and I love her. I want to be with her, live with her, make her happy, give in to her goddess-like body, which is less hairy than anything I've known before, but I'll get used to it. So, I hope you'll accept me in spite of my differences. You make a nice couple. Thanks. You were never gay. You've been taking me for a ride this whole time. You pretended to be gay to get a job? Yes. Don't say a word. I need to time to digest all this. Marc-André, I'm so sorry. I abused your trust and I understand your anger. I wanted this job so bad, I... And then... I'll move the truck tomorrow morning. I have a brilliant radar. Everybody knows it. I have the best gaydar in the Village. I can spot the only lesbian in a group of girls. In no time at all. But you... I missed it. That's what annoys me the most. Sorry for being so convincing. Arancini filled with mushrooms. What? I love arancini filled with mushrooms. Add that to your menu, my recipe. Don't tell anyone that my radar failed. We'll act as if nothing happened. Thank you, Marc-André! Share to all. YOUR BOSS WISHES YOU A NICE DAY All right! Dinner with my girlfriend! My love. Smells great. Cheers, sweetheart. That's the one you put up everywhere? Yes, everywhere! I used three rolls of paper. How do I get rid of it? 135 people have shared it. More than 2,000 likes. I don't think you can get rid of it. -I can't? -I don't think so. -What about some music? -Good idea. -You'll do it? -Well-- -Go on. -I can... -I'll do it. -All right, it's your turn. Is it me or is there a lot of distance between us? No. Distance like... It's like we have nothing to say. No. Come on. I don't agree. I've got loads to say. -Why aren't you saying anything? -I don't know. I'm just... I've... Karine, this is totally normal. Our lives have changed in many ways: the apartment, the food truck, your new career. But shouldn't we be excited about that? -And share it with each other? -Yes. But... Just give it time. I can't listen to that anymore! "Just the time it takes...", "Just wait while..." The restaurants, the bankruptcy, my parents' basement, moving house, the food truck; every time, it's, "We'll wait for it to blow over." We've been waiting for four years. We have sex every three weeks, you kiss me on the forehead when you leave. When will it stop? We delay everything, all the time. We don't even know what we're delaying. You're way ahead of yourself. Breathe, let's slow down. Sweetheart... our romantic dinner isn't going how we wanted, but we're not going to start... We won't pull at... Come with me. It'll be like how it was, babe. That's difficult to believe. I need a break. -No-- -I need time. What's going on? Going somewhere? Richard saw the photo Mom put on Facebook. He's insisting that it's his house, that he pays for everything. You? Is there room on your couch? I've got loads of room, buddy. Have you ever been on a break? -Yes. -Did you have rules? Of course! Nobody goes on a break without making rules. I know. But, out of curiosity, what were they? Subtitling: Hiventy
