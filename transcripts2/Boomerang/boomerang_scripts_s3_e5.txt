 "Judging by the customers who are willing to wait 45 minutes to get served, the LGBT Chamber of Commerce chose the right food truck." Pierre, you need to chop faster. We're victims of your success. I'll put that in the good review pile. What's that? -Fugues. -Fugues came out? Show me! Patrick, you need to be open-minded. Of course. That's insane!

 At least it's clear. Is this just in the village, or will everyone see it? "Fugues is distributed to 265,000 readers every month." Are there that many gays in the village? "The magazine is available in more than 430 places in Montreal and elsewhere in Quebec, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver." They say "village," but it's bigger than that. Oh, my God! I'm fucked. Well, Patrick, you'll have to face up to it. Pierre, I'm not just a little gay in the village. Vancouver! I'm a pan-Canadian gay! It's okay...

 LIFE COACH "Glazed chicken for my better half whom I love..." Entirely. -Patrick? -Princess. What are you doing? Something I should've done ages ago. -You're crazy. -Crazy about you. Your mouth... For the most beautiful woman. Shall we dance? Would you like me to wait outside while you finish...? Would you like me to wait...? No. I... Come in, sir. Are you here for the job? Seems that way. Vanessa Trudeau. Good luck. She won't be long. Your daughter will be back soon. Imagine, you and I on a romantic getaway, spa, massage, good food... -It's tempting, but-- -Wait. Look. "A haven of peace beside a lake, a waterfall, a stream and a river." There are four waterways. It's not just anywhere. Sylvain. Come in! Excuse me. It's my friend, he's come for his proteins. Two seconds. I'll get it for you. I won't be long. I thought I'd changed it. I get a bit lost. Sylvain... Here. You can pay me at the gym, next time. -Thanks, man. -Sure. So? -Come on, really, Pierre? -No. You know the food truck gets busy at midday. I thought I'd told you. -No. -I was afraid I'd miss you. I'm leaving in 15 minutes. I'll take it. -Did you get my message? -What message? The cinema. It's the perfect place. We can cuddle in the dark without being seen by the gay community. I'm not sure, babe. Pierre, why don't you postpone your meeting? I can't. It's the final house inspection. I can't miss it. Babe, can I have two minutes? Sorry, but your dad's let me down one hour before his shift. I'm in trouble. No. You forgot. I'll replace him. I can cut vegetables. Right? -No. -Come on! Babe, I'm your girlfriend. I wouldn't leave you in the lurch. And we could spend some time together. Let's be clear: in the village, you aren't my girlfriend. What happens in the food truck, stays in the food truck. No physical contact! Honestly... Here's your pulled pork. I know! I know! Bye. Have a great day. Hi. -Hello. -How are you? -Same as usual? -No tomatoes. No tomatoes? No tomatoes it is! Did you get that, Karine? Karine! No tomatoes in the burger. -Sorry. -Isn't Pierre here? No. I'm his best friend. I'm just as good! I'm not prejudiced. -All right. -Actually-- Sorry. Everything's fine. Where's your sexy fiancé? Worried I'll steal him from you? No. He's at work. Tomorrow, can we have our meeting about the banquet at karaoke night? Why not? Great idea. Why can't we sing and talk business at the same time? -Excuse me... -Excuse me for a moment. What's wrong? Does that mean the cinema's off? Oh, the cinema. I know it's not cool, but it's a big contract. It's fine. Actually, I'm relieved. I've got stuff to do: nails, hair. I'm gonna buy a medieval dress and get my boobs done. Here, handsome. Buy me a beer tomorrow. Double D. You'll have something to look at. Bon appétit. That's what you want? Double kiss! Pierre? Oh, sweetheart. -I know. -It's lovely. Yes. How was the interview? I didn't stay. I didn't like the vibe. It was full of old people. I've got young, fresh ideas. I didn't feel like it was the place for me. The inspection? The inspection went fine. We can... We can come back. Really? We can have our own space again? Yes. "Our own space," 40 minutes from downtown. Let's move in this weekend. There's no rush. We could sleep here tonight. I'd really love that. Sweetheart, I know, but... You see that tape? Apparently, the glue mixed with fresh paint is really bad for your lungs. That? -Yes, the tape... -The green tape? Yes, the green tape. Apparently-- -Pierre Bernier. -Yes? Dance with me. Your tattoos really suit you. You suit... your face. Thanks. Steph! Sylvain! It's.... What... I thought you were off today. I should be, but the receptionist is sick. How long have you been here? Well... 20 minutes. I can feel it working. It'll work better when you use weights. Carry on, handsome! You won't regret it. Thank you. I should thank you. You're perfect. Oh, my God... It makes a change from: "You're too old." Fifty isn't old. Well, you're... You're too kind. I know I don't look my age, but ten years younger... You're 60? Yes. I read 50. But... I'm sorry, but... it won't work. But you just said I was perfect. A dream candidate, who will soon be retired and I'll have to start again. Fifty-five? Time for karaoke! Good evening! Sorry. Good evening. I'm Karine. I'd like to dedicate this song to someone whom I love. It's our favorite song. I think it'll bring back some nice memories. Maestro! You, who leaves me at dawn Who leaves me hoping for your return Why not make this morning last Until tomorrow? I'll give you Funny Sunny croissants for breakfast With honey on the pillow I'll transport All the happy recipes you might need With music from the skies of May You'll never want to leave Patrick... My name is Stéphanie. It's lovely. The guy at the gym, is he your boyfriend? Because if he isn't, I'd be willing. Keep going. -Pierre, I lied to you. -What? All the interviews I've been to, they said I was too old. What do you mean "too old"? For Richard to use that excuse to fire me, it passes for revenge, but hearing it from people who don't even know me... No, you can't let them win. You've been fighting all your life. You're the strongest woman I know. I can't fight anymore. Now that I'm back in my suburban life, I don't care about the rest. You're right. All we have to look forward to is quietly growing old, watching the gray hairs grow and waiting for death's knock at the door. You laugh, but maybe we should accept that's where we are. Yes? Is that death? Why didn't you stay? The one time we're together. We were together for two seconds. You left in the middle of my song. You could have waited until the last chorus. He's a new client. It's thanks to him that I'm here. He's giving me a big contract. I've had enough of you putting your clients before me. It's not a nice feeling. We've had no money for months, that's my fault. But if the food truck is successful and it all works out, it's beyond our wildest dreams. I know, but I hardly see you. Yes, you do. I'm serious. I'm afraid you'll start wondering who's that girl sleeping in your bed. You're exaggerating. We always said that our relationship comes first. Our love, our bond. I'm doing all of this for us. "For us," are you sure? Of course. It's for the both of us. I get the impression that it's more for you, for your future. Look. What? All the money from the food truck isn't just to pay off the debt. I want you to have some fun. Okay? Buy whatever you want. Call a friend, go out, have some fun, do whatever you want. Enjoy yourself. Because you deserve it. All right? I'm beat. Dad, can I have a word? Yes. Here. I found that at our place, hidden behind the towels in the bathroom. It's probably Patrick's. No. The day Patrick fits into these boxers, I'll be very happy. Boxers? A razor? A toothbrush? An overnight bag. Or a survival kit for a gatecrashing roommate. It's just for... when I help Patrick and we finish late. Sure. And I'll be all alone at home. Right? Peacefully knitting for my grandchildren. Slippers that I hope to finish before I die! -You okay? -That's dark. Let's unpack some boxes. That's a first for you. It'll take our mind off things. I looked ridiculous. Do you know how long it's been since Patrick and I have been alone? Are you listening? I slept with a beefy guy with lots of tattoos. Aren't you with Sylvain? Yes. That's the problem. How did it happen? He looked at me. He smiled at me, I felt pretty, I liked it. Oh, yeah... I've always made sacrifices, I never did what I wanted. Now, I'm totally free. Understand? Totally. This is where you're hiding. I have to go... Yes! The boxes. Is she avoiding me? No. No, no, no... I think she just wants to finish unpacking. -Would you say she's changed? -Not really. I don't even have the time to see my girlfriend. No, but you've got money. Babe, I apologized for that. It just came out. If we're talking about relationships, it should be mine. Did she mention me? Not that I know of. Maybe a little bit, but not really. It doesn't mean it's over. -What? -I mean, "over" in the sense that... our conversation isn't over, if she talks to me about your relationship, or anything else... which could... Yes, I'm coming! Look who it is! Welcome! Marc-André! Sorry to disturb you during the move, but I have good news for Patrick and I had to say it with champagne, not on the telephone. San Francisco Gay Pride is coming up. One of my friends organizes it. Okay. He heard about your success in the village and he wants your food truck at Gay Pride for three days. What? San Francisco? That's crazy! It's amazing! The Chamber of Commerce invites you and Pierre. That's amazing! All expenses paid for and you can both bring someone else with you. A change of scenery would do us good. So true! I actually meant the partners. That would be me then. Sorry. I got carried away. I... Bon voyage, Sylvain! You can bring me back a souvenir. Your friend is quite intense. Yeah. Babe... I think my lie is getting out of hand. Yeah. I'm losing control. Help me, I don't know what to do. Go back to being straight or we're finished. That's maybe a bit far. That's where we are. Yes, but it involves a lot of things. Marc-André, the whole village-- Wait. You just need to come out as straight! What? Gays can't monopolize coming out! Come out of the closet through another door. -Of course. -Right! -We'll do that. -We'll do that. In a week, no one will remember. In two weeks, you'll be the village's straight mascot. In a month, we'll be the neighborhood sweethearts! Oh, yes! -What could go wrong? -It'll be fine. I've never been so in love as I am right now. Who with? This woman right here! Yes! A woman! It's overwhelming, all my life, I've been gay. Subtitling: Hiventy
