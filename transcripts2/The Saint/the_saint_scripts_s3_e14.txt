 Rudyard Kipling once said something about a duke and make one heap of all your winnings. And risk them on one turn of pitch and toss and lose and... I'm sure you know the rest. Anyway, that lady sitting there is worth 50 million U.S. dollars. And she's delirious, because she's just won 30 shillings. The gloomy young man next to her is worth absolutely nothing. And he's just lost four months nothing.

 Oonagh, any money left? Put it all on 34. I'm a lousy roulette player. Ah, but a marvelous actress. Oh, thank you, darling. Oh, by the way, this is Tex Goldman, my agent. How do you do Mr. Goldman? Nice meeting you. How do you do Mr...uh... One, two, three. Two-thousand four pounds, sir. You've had a good night, sir. Yes, not bad.

 Cash or check, sir? Cash, please. Certainly, sir. I was in Las Vegas last fall, but for my taste, it's far too brash. Too noisy. This place I like. It's intimate. Has class. Oh, he'll take your money just the same. Two thousand four pounds. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Excuse me. Of course. What is it? Oh, Mr. Laurie. I've just paid out two thousand. Cleaned out the till. Need some more cash. I'll get some. Did it work? He's just opening a safe. Give him another 20 seconds. All right, let's go. Up, quick! Face the wall. Quick. Very cooperative. That's it. Hurry. Be casual and don't run. Just a minute, gentlemen. Harrigan. He's coming. Get off! Get going. What about Corrigan? Leave him. Driver. Take the next turn left and then stop. Hello? Corrigan, where are you? Oh, like you care. What sort of filthy trick was that? Driving off and leaving me. Did you expect me to sit around while you played games with that doorman? You did? Well, where are you now? Tailed? You sure you lost him? Right, now listen, Corrigan. You go home. No, don't come here. Go home. I'll come over as soon as I can. Corrigan okay? He's safe if that's what you mean. Got himself tailed halfway across London. The idiot! Ted, he couldn't help it. He made a mistake. We don't have room for that or for him. He's scared now and scared men are dangerous. Here. Take this. Okay. And don't get itchy fingers, will you? Well, that's a nice thing to say. Get those plates out of here and the money upstairs. I'll be back in half an hour. Okay. Charlie dead? I'm sorry Mr. Malley. Inspector. Can't Miss O'Grady and I leave now? I let you know when, Mr. Goldman. Inspector. As closely as I can estimate they got away with 23,560 pounds. And you can't tell me anything else about their appearance? No. As I said they were both wearing masks. One was quite slim and the other man was bigger. How about their age. Their accents. Inspector. It all happened so quickly. They said practically nothing. Sorry I can't be more helpful. I should think Simon could. What did you say? It's just that Simon could probably tell you more about them. Oh, Simon Templar. I know the last name. Was he here tonight? We heard a shot and Mr. Laurie came out of his office into the gaming room and collapsed. And Simon rushed out. Oh, he did, did he? Well, were the devil is he now? Is that you, Ted? Yeah. Ow! What's the matter, aren't you glad to see me? Who are you? What the devil do you want? That's a fair question. Deserves an answer, I suppose. I'm by way of being a bit of a social climber. So. I'd like to meet some of your friends, Mr... Corrigan. That is the name on the door, isn't it? I don't know what you're talking about. Why don't you? I thought I made myself terribly clear. I'm talking about robbery and murder. Well, I've got nothing to say. That's a pity, isn't it? Well, I'll have to loosen your tongue a little. What's the matter? You afraid of me? No. No, I didn't think you would be. You weren't afraid of the doorman at the Baytree Club either, were you? You put two bullets into him without batting an eye. That's a lie. I didn't fire the first shot, I only- Ah. That's better. Here's your gun. Two bullets fired into Charlie Baker and only one from this. Question. Who fired the other bullet? Ah, come on. It's quite easy. Just like filling out a form. Name, weight, age, address. I don't know, I tell you. Put the gun down, I'll tell you everything! Ahh! Are you sure you're okay? Oh, yes, I'm fine. Take a pill, you must get some rest. You gotta be on the set by 8:30 in the morning. Oh, don't worry Tex, I'll be there. That's what I like about you, Oonagh, you're a real trooper. Over there, on the left. You sure you don't want me to come up? No, I think I'll just go straight to bed. You won't mind if I don't thank you for a lovely evening? Goodnight, Oonagh. How much, Enright. 23,560. Plus the 2,004 that you won. Yeah, I've got it. I'm sure you have. What about Corrigan? Nothing about Corrigan. I dealt with him. What about Templar? He tailed Corrigan. He has to be dealt with too. And fast. So you just happened to be in the Baytree Club, you happened to follow Corrigan to his flat, and you happened to be there when he was shot? Claude, if I had anything to hide, would I have phoned you and reported Corrigan's death? And you've never met him before? Never. You like the color of this tie? It sort of brings out the red in my eyes, doesn't it? Simon, this job is part of a pattern. Three bank hold ups in one month? And wages snatch and grab two weeks ago. You think it's all the work of one gang? I do, indeed. London's getting the smell of Chicago. Nothing on the files to help you? Not a thing. Big jobs in one month. I want you to state in front of the kitty. Well, their total take is around 200,000 pounds. That's a lot of money. Yes, and I think they're building up for one big final job. And you'd like to know where and when, hm? Claude, I think I have an idea. What? I'll make some coffee. Here's the Portsmouth Road. Here's the railroad track. Here's a level crossing. Takes the 9:25 from London exactly one minute and 26 seconds to cross the Portsmouth Road. After the train's past, I want the cops in the police car to see nothing. For a quarter of a million pounds, they won't even see the road. It's as easy as robbing a piggy bank. I wish I was sure. What's worrying you? Templar. How much did Corrigan spill to him? I'm not sure, I couldn't hear much from the fire escape. I'm not takin' a risk. Tex, we're throwing away a fortune. Ever tried spending a fortune in jail? I want you to get Templar. Fast, today. Otherwise the jobs off. Ha! You've got any suggestions? If I didn't, I wouldn't be the head of this outfit. Right across from Templar's mews house there's a place with a room to rent. You'll have an unobstructed view of Templar's front door. You plan to sit around here all day? Actually, I was planning to rob a jewelry store, but you inhibit me. In that case, you can take me to the film studios. Why, you thinking of taking up acting? I want to talk to your actress friend. Oonagh O'Grady. Your age? Simon, don't annoy me. Finish your coffee and let's go. It's a very pleasant neighborhood. Some awfully nice people. Yes. Yes, it's fine. I'll take it. The rent is six guineas a week, Mr., uh, what did you say your name was? Uh, Jones. Here you are. There's a week in advance. Oh, thank you. I'll give you a receipt, of course. And I'll bring your change. No, don't bother just now. I only want a rest. I've been traveling all night. Oh, you must be exhausted. Would you like some coffee or some tea or something? No, no. Nothing, thank you. Well, then I'll just take that sign out of the window. Mrs. Donaldson's let her room, I see. What're you talking about? Nothing. And if there's anything else you'd like, don't hesitate to ask me. No, I won't, thank you. Thank you very much. All right, Templar. Next time. Now, Mrs. O'Grady. The man who won last night had a lot of chips in front of him. It was his winnings that made it necessary for Mr. Laurie to open the safe. I'm sorry, I simply didn't notice him. And you? Oh, I only had eyes for Oonagh. Well, thank you Mrs. O'Grady. Can you run be back to town, Simon? Oh certainly, Claude. Dinner tonight? I'd love to. I'll call for you at eight. I said I wanted to rest. Oh, I brought your receipt. And your change. And I thought you might like a wash. Thank you. Thank you very much. Now will you please leave me alone? I'm sorry. Hello, Oonagh? Simon. Fine, you? Listen, I'd like you to do me a couple of favors. oh, you're sweet. Anyway, the first one is, would you like to call for me at eight instead of the other way around? That's right. And the second. On your way here you'll pass an antique shop on the old Brompton Road. Numbers one, seven, three. Oh, you've got it. Good girl. What on earth is all this about? Come on in. It cost me 21 pounds 10 shillings. Yes, well I'll give you the money later. Walk in front of the window. Just sit down there and I'll explain. A bit dark, isn't it? It's cozier. You see, my pet. Somebody's trying to kill me. Kill you? Don't worry. The idea's not new. It's been tried, unsuccessfully many times before. Ah, good old Julius. Now, Oonagh. The curtain is about to go up on the greatest acting role of your career. Lights. Music. Now, would you like to pour a martini. And take it and put it on the top book by Julius. No. Why not? Because at any minute, a bullet's going to come through that window. Even I get the picture, now. And I don't like the part. I promise you, you're in no danger at all. He's a trained assassin. They never miss. I can guarantee it. Yes, and my money back, no doubt. Good girl. Send camellias to my funeral, will you? They suit me. Don't spill it, you may need it. Now, come sit down over here. There goes 21 pounds, ten shillings. Better not walk in front of the window. I said you'd need that drink. After that special announcement, we continue our medley of light music. Let's not bother about dinner. I'm, uh. Gonna have to leave you. Leave me? But I just saved your life. I promise I'll be back in an hour. But where are you going? Mrs. Donaldson's new boarder is about to check out. I'd like to know where he's going. You're certain you killed him? Through the head. I saw him fall out of a chair. And you're sure Oonagh was with him? Positive. Unless she's got a twin sister. Then why doesn't she phone me? I'm about the only friend she has in London. Give her time, Tex. But Templar's dead. You can take my word for it. You'd better be right. I am. Now, come on. Let's go over the plan for tomorrow. Okay. What I said before still goes. If Oonagh does not confirm that Templar's dead, the job's off. She will. Let's get down to it. The mail van leaves Dunchester at 10:30. No matter what road it takes, it's got to pass this level crossing. Here's the railroad crossing and here's the diversion. Remember. The 9:25 takes exactly one minute and 26 seconds to cross the Portsmouth Road. Here. So you have to work to split second timing. Are your guys all set? Removal truck will be parked at that fork no later than 9 o'clock. Good. Have you tried on your police uniform? I'm so much like a cop I'm afraid to look in a mirror. How 'bout his motorcycle? Regulation police. All tuned up. You can pick it up tomorrow at 7am. Fine. So we take the mail van down the lane as far as the clearing. Not Tex. He has big interests in films and television. Business isn't louis. It doesn't make sense. Facts are facts, darling. I heard it with my own ears. What do we do now? Will you help me? Of course. Good. You must speak to Mr. Goldman and convince him that I really am dead. You're not going to make a move until I hear from Oonagh. Tex Goldman. Oh, Tex. The most terrible thing has happened. Simon Templar's been shot. I was standing right next to him. Oonagh, that's terrible. Where are you now? Do you want me to come and get you? No, I have to go with the police to make a statement. I just had to talk to somebody. No, I'll be all right. Yes, I'm sure. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Goodnight. Well done. So, what happens now? Call the police and tip them off about Goldman's mail van robbery. Okay. Can we have a drink now? Go ahead, pour. There's just one change. Yeah, what? I drove over the secondary road again this morning. Instead of following the mail van for a mile, I found a clearing here. It's just 400 yards from the fork. Makes for a faster, tighter operation. Okay. Anything else? Just a toast. To the whole operation. Here's to the very dead Mr. Simon Templar and a quarter of a million pounds. You nervous? A little. You joined the police force for adventure, didn't you? Adventure's fine. I just don't want to get hurt. Do exactly what they tell you to. The switch is a mile up the secondary road. Our boys will be waiting. Well, that's the first one right on schedule. There's a police car up the road. We'll do it here. We're police officers and you're both under arrest. If you take my advice, you'll hand over that gun. You are one second away from being dead. Get over there. About 30 seconds. That's the lot, come on. Get in the car! Who tipped you off? Little Bo Peep. What went wrong? I don't know. But Tex Goldman's got some explaining to do. Are we being followed? I don't think so. Looks like we're clear away. It was a tip off. They were waiting for us. We take all the risk for a quarter of a million pounds while Tex, the big mastermind, sits on his fat. We're sitting on it now, aren't we? I want to see it. What do you mean? I want to see the money, stop somewhere. You're crazy! I said stop somewhere! What you going to do? Do? I'm going to cut Tex Goldman's heart out. Hello? Nilder? The whole thing went wrong. There was a tip off. The whole place was swarming with cops. Have you heard from Orping? No. The phone hasn't rung since you left. Those stupid jerks. They could've been caught. Listen, I'm going back to the studio. That'll be my alibi. But, what about me? You sit tight. I'll join you later. Then we'll scram out of here together. Understand? Yeah, okay. Whatever you say. If you hear from Enright or Orping call me at the studio. Okay, bye. Who is it? Orping, Enright? Who is it? Who are you? Introductions can wait. What're you doing? I'm locking the door so we won't be disturbed. Now, would you like to open the safe? What safe? Look, my friend. I don't have time to waste. Would you open the safe? I'll call the police up. Now, would you like to pick the case up and open the safe? Pick it up! Raise the mirror. Very ingenious. Carry on. Listen I, I don't know the combination. Oh, I think you do. Am I right? Do you?! That's what I like. Freely given cooperation. Now, while I help myself to a drink, you will take what's in the safe and put it in the suitcase. He was shot through the head, I was standing right next to him. Must have been horrible for you. I'm sorry. I'd rather not talk about it. Sure It's funny. I was wondering why Templar's death wasn't in the papers. Maybe the police are trying to keep it quiet. Yeah. Maybe so. Well, I'll be on the set if you need me. All right, Tex. The lot? Put your coat on. Follow me. Where are we going? You ask too many questions. Put the case in the back. Don't scratch the upholstery. Put it down there. Hello? Oh, Simon. I've been trying to get a hold of you for an hour. Tex is here at the studio. I don't know what's happened but he's here. So you lied! Templar's not dead at all! Oonagh? Oonagh? Sit down there. You're a regular little Jack-in-the-Box aren't you now, sit down. Welcome home, mate. Let me go. Sit there and shut up. What happened? A lot happened. Mate. The whole operation blew wide open. And instead of a quarter of a million pounds, those mailbags were filled with paper! You stupid, wooden-headed, incompetent slob. What're you talking about? Templar is still alive. You're crazy. He was wise to you from the start. He faked his own death. With a bust on top of a pile of books in a chair. I don't believe it. Tell him. It's true. Of course it's true. I heard her talk to him 20 minutes ago. He was behind those windows last night. Those that blew open. He told the cops. Tex, I don't understand, I mean-- There's a lot of things you don't understand you stupid slob. Where's Nilder? I don't know. I-Shut up. Boss, listen. You too. There's every cop in town after us. Well, now it's every man for himself. You and Enright can have 5,000 pounds each. Try to get out of England and you'll be arrested in five seconds. Go some place and hold up. And keep quiet. If you don't, you're dead. Sir, I made a mistake. Anybody could've been-- There's no use getting mad at me, I couldn't help it. Scum! Listen, boss. C'mon. Where to? Templar's place. You too, baby, we may need you. Oonagh, if Templar doesn't cooperate, we'll cut you up a bit. Oh! Run for it, Oonagh. Get out the way. Get out the way! Hey! Oonagh? All right? Are you all right? Yes, I... Fine, I've got a little thing there. Doesn't it, uh, hurt, Claude? 200,000 pounds and you have to return it to the rightful owners? It would hurt me a lot more to lose on this. The pleasure of staking it, Claude. How much this worth? Five pounds. Put it on 16. How about 34? 16. 34. Bad luck, Claude. 35 to one you'd have won 175 pounds. It was my stake money. Goodnight, Claude. Croupier. Do you have change for a pound?
