 We've got a tremor outside. Anyone explain to me why we built this lab on a historically established tectonic fault‐line? Imagine if the EM's failed and the whole structure dropped to the ground. Fuck yeah. All this glass. And us in it. Scary shit. Guess we're good. Katie wasn't scared though. She didn't even lift her head.

 You know why she's not scared that the big quake might come today? Because she already knows it doesn't. I have a strong understanding of the magnetic fields supporting us, our tolerances in an earthquake, and our backup power‐systems. If you're feeling anxious, I can explain it to you. It's okay, Katie. I believe you. Boss is here. Is it morning already? This place is like Vegas, I never know what time it is. Hey. Hey. Did you sleep okay?

 I did. Eventually. Yeah, same. Thanks for letting me stay, Jamie. Oh, come on. You couldn't go back last night. Not alone. Not after what we saw. But still, thanks. And you didn't have to let me take your bed. Or change your sheets. Well, you know. Chivalry. And I kind of did need to change the sheets. Is it wise... to retread these steps? Or is it helpless? I don't need a lecture, Katie. What if someone else had walked in, instead of me? If the technicians see you accessing the future, it makes it seem as if the rule is open to being broken. They know not to break the rule. And they know we do break the rule. You still shouldn't be watching this. It doesn't help. What were you doing? Checking that the tramlines remain intact? Maybe. I don't know. I'm just scared. Of what? Us. Me and you. Everything we do is predicated on the idea that we live in a physical universe. Not a magical universe. Are you doubting that? Not the physical universe. But I am scared we might be magicians. What if we project one minute into the future. ‐Right now. ‐Forest... What if, Katie. What if one minute into the future, we see you fold your arms. And you say, "Fuck the future." I'm a magician. My magic breaks tramlines. "I'm not going to fold my arms." You put your hands in your pockets. And you keep them there until the clock runs out. Cause precedes effect. Effect leads to cause. The future is fixed in exactly the same way as the past. The tramlines are real. In 48 hours... Lily will die. There's no magic. Effectively... it's already happened. They're going to kill me. It's a single phone call to the police or the FBI. You're not thinking it through. They'll kill me. Not get angry, not threaten to sue... Kill me. Like they killed Sergei. Then we make it anonymous. We tell the cops about the doctored film. Where to look. What to look for. They do the rest. I think you need to stop seeing them as a tech company. See them as the mob. You really want to call the cops and inform on the mob? You feel confident they can protect you? Yes, with witness protection. Living in fucking Iowa for the rest of my days? Then what? You wanna take them down, yes, okay, fine, but you, Lily Chan, computer engineer, can't take them down. - Not alone. It's impossible. - Jamie, just... - What? - Just stop trying to fix this. Stop trying to know what to do. Okay? Neither of us knows what to do. I'm gonna go back home. What? They'll be keeping tabs on me. I don't want anything to look wrong. ‐I'm coming with you. ‐No. ‐Yes. ‐No. I don't want them to know you exist. That's my problem. Your problem? More chivalry? You realize this is a step up from changing the sheets. Fuck, Lily, that... You know for two years, I've been shadowed by a thousand things about you. Your face in the morning. Stupid jokes we had, names we had for each other. But I just remembered what it was really like going out with you. I was thinking the same thing, actually. I just want you to be safe. I know. I'd like us both to be safe. I'll check in with you later, okay? Yeah. Super fucking okay. Hey brother. You got a smoke there, man? Ah, right on. Thank you. Oh, you got a... Yeah. I've been ringing that bell here for Lily Chan. She lives here. You know her? Yeah. You see her today? Or last night? Don't worry. I'm not the police. I know. Still worried, though. Lily and I work together, I'm just here to pick her up. Uh. Gotcha. I'm sorry, man, no offence. That's Lily's window right up there. Yeah. I think she left you a note. Not afraid of you, man. Yeah, I can see that. Just trying to figure out why. Thank you. Yo, Lily. Stranger danger. Shit. Hey, if you got a problem, I've got your back. For real. Thanks. How are you, Lily? Feeling a little better than yesterday. Thank you. That's great. You remember we had an appointment to see a doctor this morning? Oh. Right. So, one thing. Erm... I think I'm not ready for that yet. ‐No? ‐No. It's like, I know how this goes, these episodes I have, and, I think it would be better for me to just stay home. You're feeling stronger... ‐less delicate. ‐Yeah. Exactly. That's good. Still, on balance, uh, I think you should see a doctor. - I just know that... - You had a panic attack in my office and stepped out on to a third story window ledge, Lily. I don't blame you for wanting to pretend it didn't happen, but it did. See the doctor and we're done. Holy shit. So, Lily. Erm, I'd like to go through a few details before we get into the specific reasons as to why you're here. ‐Would that be okay? ‐Yes. Thank you. Let's start with your age. Twenty‐seven. Twenty‐seven. And have you had any physical illnesses recently? No. No. Very good. Are you on any prescription medication? ‐No. ‐Any recreational drug use? Cannabis, cocaine, MDMA, hallucinogens... Nothing for a while. How... What are we calling "a while"? Years. Maybe three. Okay... And which drugs specifically? The ones you mentioned. All the ones I mentioned? Yeah. But like I said, nothing for a while. I understand. And is there any history of mental illness in your family? No. This would include uncles, aunts, grandparents. No. Tell me about your family. What about my family? Parents professions, upbringing. Right. My dad died when I was 10. Heart condition. He was an industrial engineer. My mother remarried after he died, she moved to Hong Kong, had a second family. Brothers? Sisters? No full brothers or sisters. From my point of view, I'm an only child. - Are you close to your mother? - More or less. What does that mean? I don't know. We act close. ‐But...? ‐We're not close. I just think it's easier for her to believe we're close than to realize we're not. - That's not uncommon, I think. - Yeah. How are you sleeping? Not well. Having trouble getting to sleep? Waking during the night? Both. ‐Appetite? ‐Low. And if now we were to talk about the specific incident that led you here, the incident at your workplace, how would you describe it? I can't. You can't describe it? I don't remember it. You remember nothing about it at all? No. It's a total blank. Like it's erased from my memory. So I can't really tell you anything. Well, what would you speculate might have happened? I guess the death of my boyfriend triggered... stuff. I've had episodes before. Like after my dad died. So maybe it's that. Or maybe it's a chemical imbalance of some sort. Lily, anything you say to me is bound by very strict terms of patient/doctor confidentiality. You know that, don't you? Yes. So if I were to promise that you can say whatever you like, under those terms of confidentiality, what would you wanna talk about? Why don't you just say whatever is coming into your head. Yeah. No. Sorry. I'll be there in 40 minutes. No, no, it's just a family issue. Yeah, totally. Okay. All right. See you. Bye. Okay. Okay. We have a prediction system based on ultra‐massive data. The data goes to a sub‐atomic level, so we're fully in the world of quantum mechanics using a fully deterministic interpretation for which we use a version of De Broglie‐Bohm. Pilot wave. And it works. Kind of. We glimpsed Christ on the cross. Exactly. We didn't see him, or hear him. We glimpsed him. Through a blizzard of variances. And the boss doesn't like variances? The binary problem in our quantum system. It either works totally or not at all. Right? Right. And particularly bad for me, 'cause I'm focused on soundwaves, which are mega fragile, and the variances go wild mega fast. So most of my day, I'm hearing shit like this. Inelegant. Ugly. Drop‐out. And it gets worse the further we travel back in time and the worse is exponential. Hearing that shit through my headphones all day, it... drives me a little crazy. So I figure I need a break. I get up. Just to clear my head for a while. I find myself over at our core computer. Thinking how crazy all this shit is. Entanglement, superpositions, all the voodoo. And I'm thinking, fucking De Broglie‐Bohm, fucking Pilot Wave, fucking hidden variables. I wish I could ditch them all. So I did. That's a projection? Yeah. It's fucking crystal. - What language is that? - It's Aramaic. From 2000 years ago. That's Jesus talking? Tell them what you fucking did! I switched out De Broglie‐Bohm for the Everett interpretation. Many Worlds. Still deterministic. Deterministic because everything than can happen, will happen. And that's as deterministic as you can get. Cute, Lyndon. It's a cute party trick. Hell of a party. Glad I'm invited. No. It's a waste of time. And it's dangerous. Why is it dangerous? Because it's seductive. As I can see from all your faces, lit up, hearing Jesus talk, getting nerd hard‐ons. But let's all just be clear. It's not actually Jesus talking, is it? No, it is Jesus talking. But not our Jesus, from our history. It's a Jesus, from a history. And every time you run the system, you'll get a different outcome. But the difference might be a single hair on Jesus's head. No, it will be that difference. And three hairs difference. And four. And a thousand. And all points in between, and either side. That's your response to what I've just achieved? We're splitting hairs. No, Lyndon. This is my response: You're fired. What? You're fired. You've undermined everything I'm trying to do. Katie... - Forest... - Shut up, Katie. - Are you kidding me? - I'm not kidding anyone. This is a message to the whole team. If you didn't know it with the Russian kid, you know it now. I will not accept this project being undermined. Lyndon, you'll get your Devs separation pay. Ten million dollars. And if you talk about your work here to anyone, in any context, at any time, I'll know. Now get your stuff and get out. All good? Yes. Thank you. I'd like to go home now? Absolutely. Just need to get the doctor's invoice. Take a seat for a couple of minutes. Be quick. She's a highly intelligent young woman. I'd say she was extremely upset by the death of her boyfriend, and she has various relationship issues, but I wouldn't say she's suffering from either schizophrenia or psychosis. And I don't think she ever has. So she was lying? It was all an act. You understand I can't be a hundred percent sure. But the probability is high. Sorry about that. Let's get you home. I don't know what the fuck just happened. ‐My head is... ‐Lyndon... I mean, I just fucking fixed that guy's shit. His shit, I fucking fixed it. ‐And he fires me? ‐Lyndon... ‐What? ‐Go. ‐Go? ‐Go. You're very young, you're very rich, go. You mean I never see this place again? Do I ever see you again? We don't even hang out? Lyndon, I want to know that you were listening. I am listening. Not to me. I want to know you were listening to him. To Forest. He said he'd kill you. He will. Now, this moment, go. Lily. I know everything. I had a conversation with the psychiatrist. What? Gave me a clear evaluation that you're highly paranoid and delusional, and suffering from severe psychosis. My feeling is you're a high suicide risk. And that puts an obligation on me, as a representative of your employer. ‐The duty of care. ‐No! Lily, we both know your mental state. And your history. This is not the way to my apartment. We're not going to your apartment. Stop the car. Now. Can't do that. Stop the fucking car. I'm afraid not. ‐ ‐ ‐ ‐ Hey wait. - Hey, where are you going? - Call an ambulance! Hey, buddy. Hey, Buddy are you okay? ‐Shit. ‐You okay, buddy? The girl. Where did she go? She... Hey, Dude! You're bleeding! Fuck. You just fired my most talented engineer. Did you already know you were going to do that? Did you? Lyndon introduced the multiverse into Devs. He broke a rule that isn't open to being broken. He used exceptionally beautiful mathematics. To make near infinite variations on our history. A version of our world where you're seated an inch to the left, or an inch to the right. Or the Pope converted to Islam, or the moon landings were achieved by Cambodia. ‐It works. ‐It does not work! It does not work. If it's not our Jesus, it's not my Amaya. And does every hair on her head matter? Yes, it does. I broke a rule today too. Just now. I took Lyndon's Many Worlds Algorithm for sound waves... and I applied it to light waves. Oh, Christ. ‐Lily? What happened? ‐ 911, what's your emergency? - I'm reporting a crime. - What's the nature of the crime? - Murder. - The name of the person? Sergei Pavlov. P, A, V, I, O, V. - When did it happen? - No. Five days ago. And what's the address? Ma'am, are you still there? 1303 Oak Hill Avenue, apartment forty. And what's your name? - Lily Chan. - Spell it for me. C, H, A, N. Please stay on the line, I'm gonna make a report. No. I'm not going to stay on the line, - just send someone. - No, no. Please don't... I was wrong. You were right. We need the police. They're here. I guess this is it. - Lily Chan? - Yes. I'm arresting you for reckless endangerment in the first degree while taking control of a vehicle. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Excuse me, Officer, this is a mistake. You have a right to an attorney before and after questioning, if not we will appoint one for you. ‐Do you understand? ‐No! - Suspect replied no. - Yep. Turn around, put your hands behind your back where I can see them. - What the fuck is going on? - Okay, let's go. No! You have to stop! ‐You don't understand! ‐Doctor? Oh, my God. As state‐designated clinician, do you confirm that this is the subject of the 50‐150 H&S;? ‐Yes. ‐You can't do this. This is her. On the grounds that she is a danger to herself and a danger to others, we turn her over to involuntary psychiatric hold. - Oh, my God! No! No! - Come on, let's go. Jamie! Hello, Jamie.
