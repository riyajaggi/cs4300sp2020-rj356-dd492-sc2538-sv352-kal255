 What are you doing? Working on sound‐wave data. I mean what are you watching? That... is Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe having sex. Jesus. It's the celebrity sex tape to end all celebrity sex tapes. Why do male techs always feel the need to caricature themselves? Step one: Create a new technology that reinvents the nature of human existence.

 Step two: Use it for porn. To thine own self be true. We have two fucking rules, guys. One: We don't look forwards, we only look back. Two: We don't invade privacy. They're having sex, Katie. And that would be the invasion of privacy. Hardly a person exists that didn't come into being because two other people had sex. As far as human behavior goes, that puts it on a par with breathing. Your hang‐ups are not my hang‐ups. Got it, Stewart. So, you'd be cool if we brought everyone in

 to watch you having sex. Not sure the system's powerful enough to predict that far back in time. Turn it off. Scratch some other geek itch. Do the grassy knoll. Been there, done that. It was Oswald. Whatever. Find something else. And don't break the fucking rules. "Don't break the rules"? Coming from her... Senator. Forest. Good to see you. We've got an hour and a half. I have a lunch back in town. And how are tricks in quantum computing? ‐Kenton. ‐Joe. Thriving. My senate subcommittee on tech oversight has scheduled its hearing. I'm going to call you in, Forest. Why? Your company didn't just take the lead in the quantum computer race. You demolished your competitors. They have nothing. You have... everything. And I have questions. Is that your leverage? Questions. You don't think that's leverage? What are you working on in the section of your company known as Devs? Devs means development. Every tech company has a development division. Yes. But what specifically are you developing? Uh, we're exploring the potential of our quantum computer system. That's a little vague. Vague sounds like you don't like attention. Why is that? It distracts us from our work. The distractions are trivial in comparison to your work. Yes. Isn't that the perfect argument as to why your company needs government oversight? But you don't want oversight, Senator. You want control. You want my systems for the NSA. We want your systems for America. Unless you think America's trivial too. Do you see how this works? Do you know how easily I would crucify you in a public hearing? People have become scared of the tech companies, Forest. Really scared. AI is gonna create sixty percent unemployment. Instagram makes people feel like shit about their lives. Twitter makes them feel reviled. Facebook destroyed democracy. They use you. They need you. But they don't like you anymore. Now there are other lines of questioning. Your company is an American success story, showing again how we lead the world in tech. While we understand and respect the competitive nature of your industry, and the requirement for trade secrets, could you shed a little light on what you're working on in Devs? We're using our quantum system to develop a prediction algorithm. Predict what? Stock markets? Market trends? Sure. The weather? And that kind of thing. So, you're working on a prediction algorithm for the weather. There's no reason why it should be hard for us to work together. So, is it going to rain tomorrow? Doesn't look like it. Okay, you start with the question: Is N the product of P times Q. Then imagine two sine waves, where one is length P, and one Q. Just figure out the phase of each wave at any given point on the number line. So, if we look at point N, the phase of P and Q must be zero if they're factors of N. I get it. Or else there would be... - ‐a remainder... - Uh, hang on, guys... Hi, Lily. Sorry I'm late. None of us thought you were coming. Or we would have waited. It's okay. It's better for me to be here. It's hard at home. Right. Of course. We were just going over Shor. Um... Circling back. Um... Shor is testing whether the phase of P equals the phase of Q equals zero, and that's as far as we got. Lily. Lily? Sorry. Did you ask me something? Guys, will you give us a minute? - Sure. - Thanks. Hey. Hey. I'm sorry. No, don't say that. Come on. Talk to me, Lils. I do really need to talk to someone. I'm right here. Can I talk to you? ‐Of course. ‐I mean safely. Safely? I can trust you? Lily, will you please stop doing that to your hands. I can trust you. Yes, you can. Totally. Can we talk outside? So... everyone believes Sergei committed suicide, but I think it might not be true. What do you mean? What isn't true? I saw the film of what happened. But I think it was fake. A cover story. I'm sorry. I'm‐‐ I just need to understand exactly what you mean. Are you saying that Sergei might still be alive? I don't know. Maybe that. Maybe something else. ‐But they found a body, Lils. ‐It was burned to shit. Who knows if it was him? Could be anyone. Sorry to be graphic, okay? But I think they can still identify burned bodies. DNA, dental, that kind of thing. But who's doing the identifying? The CIA? No, not the CIA. The police. The coroner. And what if they're a part of it? Part of what? I spoke to someone yesterday. Whatever's going on, it... Hey. Oh, hey, Jen. What are you guys doing? Lils and I were just talking. ‐Okay. ‐You mind Jen joining us? No. She's cool. So, Lils was talking about Sergei. ‐And she has some thoughts. ‐More than thoughts. Right. That there might be something weird about what happened. So, what were you going to say? About who you spoke to. I can't tell you too much. But it's international, okay? It involves international forces. It's fucked up. Okay. I'm not making any judgment about anything you're saying. I'm not saying any of it is wrong. It's not fucking wrong. Sure. But even if everything you're worried about is true, you're still someone who has suffered a terrible shock. A terrible loss. And I think you need to talk to someone who can help you with that. Yeah. I do. Good. I'll speak to Kenton. The head of security? I think that's a good idea, Lils. This is the kind of thing you should be telling Kenton. It's above our pay‐grade, right? Yeah. He'll know what to do. Jen, mind if I talk to you a moment? What the fuck are you doing? Can't you see she's not well? Of course I can see. Then what are you doing going along with this shit? ‐International forces? ‐Okay, look. I didn't want to get into this. But me and Lils go back. This isn't the first time, okay? She's had... episodes. ‐Stuff like this before. ‐Stuff like what? Schizophrenia. Oh, shit. If we make the wrong move now, anything could happen. She could flip. She could run. She could vanish. And then no one can help her. So, what we do is get her into the system without her realizing. We make it look like we're doing what she wants. Okay, I get it. I'll make the call. I get a good suit. The pay is better than I'm used to. And I don't have to go two weeks without a shower. But the truth is... all day, every day, I am bored out of my fucking mind. What I wouldn't give for some little jerk to pull a gun or a knife, and try and take her out. But... never happens. Seriously. Don't you miss it? The uniform? The fucking adrenaline. Honestly, can't say I do. Excuse me. Kenton. Lily Chan? I don't think that's a good idea. Her super? What exactly did she say? I'll be there in ten minutes. Shit. Can you hold the fort? Think I'll just about manage. So, I got a message from your supervisor that you wanted to talk to me personally. Do you want to talk in private? No. I want her to stay. Okay. So... I'm here. Go ahead. It's about Sergei. There's... stuff. Stuff about him you don't know. Like what? Like he wasn't what he said he was. He was working for someone. And I met a man yesterday who knew all about it. Who was that? A spy. An operative. ‐An "operative". ‐Yes. Russian. And I don't think Sergei committed suicide. I think he was murdered. Murdered by who? I think it was them. ‐The operatives. The Russians. ‐Yes. They were trying to trick me. They were trying to recruit me, okay? But I saw through it. Because I've been through all this before. In Brooklyn. In‐‐ In Brooklyn? A few years ago, I was working with a start‐up. I was on the encryption team, and I started to see a whole bunch of things that made no sense. Like, I'd look at strings that should have been RNG's, but they obviously weren't RNG's. There were Fibonacci sequences everywhere, I mean, fucking everywhere. ‐That's‐‐ What's a... ‐She was seeing a pattern in what should have been random numbers. And you get the same pattern in nature. Like numbers of petals on a flower. Number of segments in a shell. And at that time, I had a boyfriend who had a dragon flower tattoo over his arm and back. And I counted the petals, okay? And it was five and eight. And the dragon had twenty‐one scales. And that's the same fucking thing. ‐Same as what? ‐Same as Sergei. I'm not following. Are you telling me this is all a coincidence? ‐Lily? ‐No! Just answer the question. Can this be a coincidence? Jen, you remember what happened in Brooklyn. ‐Yes. ‐And now Sergei. Right? Right. So? I mean do not fucking do this, Jen. ‐You were there, back then. ‐Lily, please. Yes, I was there. Then don't look at me like you think I'm crazy. I'm telling you, I met the fucking Russian operative yesterday, right by Golden Gate Bridge. In‐‐ In broad daylight. Jesus fucking Christ, Jen, I swear to God, if you're not going to believe me... I didn't say I didn't believe you... Fuck! I need air. Nobody expects technological progress to be reversed. It never is. I think the equivalent is the Industrial Revolution, which makes my job to stop the Luddites from smashing the looms. Good to know, Senator. So, you'd continue to protect my tech company even if I stopped raising money for your campaign? ‐Don't be cute. ‐Likewise. My campus is not... You're telling me she's actually been hospitalized before. For like a month. Maybe more. I don't know much, her family took care of it. ‐But... ‐Hold on. ‐Sir. ‐Lily Chan is on the ledge ‐outside your office. ‐What? Get her down safely. Right fucking now. Fuck. Okay, Lily. Mind telling me what we're doing out here? Just needed fresh air. Air's not fresh enough on the ground? Needed to get out. Well, we're out. I guess the air is fresh up here. So... let's not make any sudden movements in the ground direction. Lily, I've got to tell you something. Everything you told me about the Russian operatives, and Sergei, you probably feel that people won't believe you. Maybe they'll think you're crazy. But actually, I do believe you. I think it all may be true. Man, it's a crazy world. The shit that happens is weirder than anyone ever expects, ever imagines. True, right? Well, that's‐‐ that's what people like you and me know. That nothing is stranger than reality. Nothing. Yeah. In the meantime, you see those people down there? They're worried you're gonna jump. I'm not, because I think we understand each other. But they have their hearts in their mouths. They're frightened. I think the right thing to do is for us to just walk back down this ledge. Crawl back onto that walkway. And you tell me whatever else it is you need me to know. Okay? Okay. Come on. Quite the day. ‐Yeah. ‐I'll be in touch. You lucky son of a bitch. It's all go in tech. Sir. That was very close, Kenton. It nearly fucked the universe. There's an upside, sir. We have an ace‐card with Lily Chan. What ace card? She's schizophrenic. Or something. According to her pal, she's had at least two previous episodes, one of which required hospitalization. ‐And we didn't know? ‐Well, she hid it. Undeclared on her medical forms, in case she couldn't get the job. But it's cool. We can play that card any time. Anything she says about us is dismissible. Anything that happens to her is explainable. But nothing is going to happen to her, Kenton. I know. So, where is she now? Her buddy took her home. Seems to know how to handle her. And tomorrow, we set her up with a shrink. One of ours. That keeps her both at arm's length, and under observation. It's all okay, sir. We're still on your tram lines. Holy mother‐fucking shit! That was Oscar‐level, Lils. Like, Jesus. The crying? Fucking incredible. I didn't have to reach far to find that. But still. And that Fibonacci stuff. The tattoo. You told them I had a psychiatric history? Yep, and they bought it. Hundred percent. I mean, I fucking bought it. Do you think they can check? I think they can try, but where do they look? You could have been in Canada or Mexico for all they know. Here. It's got exactly what you wanted. Thank you so much. No. He was my friend too. So, this is your new thing, then? Appearing outside windows. It kind of is. Jamie... I do need your help again. Sure. Sergei was missing twenty‐four hours after leaving Amaya. In that time, he didn't use his phone. He didn't use a credit card. The only information anyone has is the film of him walking back into Amaya, and setting himself on fire. I have all the security footage from that night right here. But I can't watch it alone. You want us to watch the man you left me for burn himself to death... together? That's transcendently weird, Lily. I know. Okay. Wi‐Fi's ultra‐dead. We're unseeable. Jesus Christ. Are you sure about this? I can watch it alone. You don't have to see it again. I'm okay, Jamie. Just play it. Fuck. ‐ ‐ Okay. ‐There's nothing there. ‐No. No. Wait a second. ‐What? ‐I'm not sure. Just let me... Whoa. What is it? Look, right here, right here. The flames... they're the same. Every frame... the same flame. ‐Do you see it? ‐I see it. It's VFX. One hundred percent, they're not real. You said there was a body, right? Yes. But a physical body. You actually saw it. I saw it. The police were there. Forensics. If you saw a physical body, and it's a digital fire effect, that allows for a possibility. The body is real, the suicide is fake. They murdered him.
