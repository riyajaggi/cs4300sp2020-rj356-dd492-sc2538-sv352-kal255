 Show them, show them, show them... - So... - Don't. Don't what? Just... let it be normal. This. Yes. Normal. Yeah. Okay. I can do normal. So what about the dishwasher? What about the dishwasher? Did it get emptied last night? I'm not tryna make a big deal or anything y'know, I just... you did say you were gonna do it, and I did it the night before, - so... - Uh, excuse me. I walked the dog. You were gonna empty the dishwasher. We have a dog? We don't have a dog. We have a cat. Hmm. So you walked the cat? Yeah. Yeah, okay, well good. Because the cat's not gonna walk itself. Can you see Daddy? We can discuss this in like 30 seconds. I know we can discuss it in 30 seconds. We can also discuss it now. No, I'm hanging up! You know I hate talking and driving. You can't wait 30 seconds? We could go further back. Further than a billion years? We don't need to. It works. Why don't I feel good about it? That would be your unconscious mind speaking to you. And what it's saying is, "Uh-oh". Because a few hours ago, we were in reality, and we were working on a sim. And now we've pretty much traded. That's the reality. Right there. It's not even a clone of reality. The box contains everything. It doesn't contain us. One second projection. Oh shit. Oh shit. What the fuck, Stewart? What the fuck, Stewart. That's messed up. That's messed up. Switch it off. Switch it off. The box contains us. The box contains everything. And inside the box, there's another box. Ad infinitum; ad nauseam. Uh-oh. Hey. Yeah. I think I'll go. I know. We both know. We both know this particular day inside and out. Forwards and backwards. Up to a point. Right. Okay. - I'll see you there. - Yeah. Remember Lyndon's in your car. There's that whole thing. Sure. Hi Lyndon. Shit. Uh, sorry. Uh, I was... asleep. Um... I really need to talk to you, Katie. And I thought you might be here. Just give me a chance and hear me out, please? I know you have got to get to work, but we could drive up 280 and find somewhere to stop. Maybe Crystal Springs Dam? It's right on the way. Sure, Lyndon. We'll do that. Cool. ♪ Please give me back my shine ♪ ♪ Please give me back my shine ♪ ♪ Please give me back my shine ♪ ♪ For a while ♪ ♪ For a while ♪ ♪ For a while ♪ Lils. Are we leaving normality? Yeah. Only for a moment though. I want to know... What's our plan? Last night, you asked what was on their mind. And I said madness. They're having the tech nerd's wettest dream. The one that reduces everything to nothing. Nothing but... code. What does that mean? It means they believe everything is computational. And of course, they've cracked the encryption key to compute it. So everything is unpackable... and packable. And reverse-engineerable. And predictable. Stars. Planets. Dust. Us. Me. You know the problem with the people who run tech companies? They have too much power. It drives them crazy. They end up thinking they're Messiahs. Sometime after midnight, they think I'm gonna go to Devs. And they think I'm gonna do something that folds into their plan. But I'm gonna fuck them up. I'm gonna contradict their prediction. They say I'm gonna go to Devs. So all I have to do is not go. We fuck 'em up by hanging out in your apartment for a day? Yeah. I'd sort of mentally prepped myself for a high-speed police chase and twenty years in jail, but... okay. Let's try your way. Do you want me to pretend I don't know what happens next? So you've watched this before? Breaking your own rules, Katie. That's why you're cool. Why didn't you look into the future? You could have. Why ask a question, when you've already heard the answer? I didn't want to know the future, it's not that strange. While I have the illusion of free will, I have the illusion of free will. You know he's wrong. And I don't blame him. I never liked the Everett Interpretation either. I liked Penrose or Pilot Wave. But it turns out that Everett was right. The many worlds are real. You're right, Lyndon, I do know he's wrong. - You do? - Yes. - Then why haven't you said? - You don't understand. I don't understand what? You're here to argue for your job back. To ask me to appeal to Forest on your behalf, but the conversation you planned isn't how this plays out. It isn't? No. A few moments from now, you climb over this rail. You stand on the other side and balance there, right on the edge of the dam. Just your toes on the concrete, arms outstretched, not holding the rail. What? Whether you stay balanced or fall depends on quantum variations of the air around you, the wind. I'm not following, why the fuck would I do that? It's an act of faith. - Or belief. - In what? Exactly what you just said. In many worlds. If you believe in it, you know there will be worlds in which you fall. And worlds in which you don't. But you'll only be conscious of the worlds in which you remain alive. And the worlds in which I remain alive... are the worlds in which I'm allowed back into Devs? That's the idea. So... so you're saying I demonstrate my total belief in the multiverse? Like a mystic walking over burning coals. Yes. Would I climb the rail if you hadn't told me? I did tell you. Do you see me fall? I've watched us here many times and I never answer that question. Why? If I tell you you don't fall, it negates your act of belief. A mystic walking over unlit coals. Whoa. Whoa. I get it. It's a perfect circle. Oh shit. That's elegant. That's fucking beautiful. I love it. Yeah. You do. Okay, so when do I do it? When do I climb over? - Now. - Now? Fuck! Fuck! Okay. Jesus Christ. My heart is pounding out of my fucking chest. You really aren't gonna tell me if you see me fall or not? No. This is intense. I work all day and get half drunk at night. Waking at four to soundless dark, I stare. In time, the curtain-edges will grow light. Till then I see what's always really there: unresting death. The mind blanks at the glare. Not in remorse, the good not done, the love not given, time torn off unused. But at the total emptiness forever, the sure extinction that we travel to, and shall be lost in always. Not to be here, not to be anywhere, and soon. Nothing more terrible, nothing more true. This is a special way of being afraid. No trick dispels. Religion used to try, that vast moth-eaten musical brocade, created to pretend we never die. And specious stuff that says no rational being can fear a thing it will not feel. Not seeing that this is what we fear, no sight, no sound, no touch or taste or smell. Nothing to think with, nothing to love or link with, the anesthetic from which none come round. And so it stays just on the edge of vision, a small unfocused blur, a standing chill that slows each impulse down to indecision. Most things will never happen. This one will. I like the acoustics here. Who was that? Guess. You know, Forest, I don't mind that you don't know who I was quoting, but I do mind that you can't even guess. Such big decisions being made about our future, by people who know so little about our past. Isn't knowing our past exactly what we're doing here? No, it isn't. The Devs system now works. What do you mean? It works. Fully. Totally. As of a few hours ago. Want to hear Antony talking to Cleopatra? You can. Want to see dinosaurs? The formation of the solar system? You can. No distortion. Drop-out zero. It flat-out fucking works. What did you do? Ignored you. I ignored you. We ignored you. All of us. Followed Lyndon's principle. Made the system based on the universe as it is, not your restricted obsessions. Forest... Who was Mark Antony? Guess. Guess. Can you bring me a glass of water too, please? Sure. _ Bitch. Lily, I need you to go sit on the couch for me, okay. You were counting in Russian. You were with the man I met by the bridge. And Sergei. My orders were to watch and protect him, if I could. And then my orders were... to watch you. But not protect. But I've seen your courage... how you fought and fought. And I couldn't let Kenton kill you. That was not an order. It was a choice. And now it's a problem, for both of us. There are two dead bodies in your apartment. American citizens. Something like this, it cannot be hidden. It can only be denied. So my side will deny it. And I will disappear. This works for me. But it doesn't work for you. So now we need to talk about your options. You can go to the CIA. Not the police, not the FBI. The CIA. They're the only organization that can make sense of what has happened here. But you will be pulled into their world of interrogations and process. It could go on for years. Or... you leave for the airport. Immediately. You carry a passport, some money, a phone... and you board the first flight to Hong Kong. There's no extradition there. You stay with your mother. But you can never come home. I have to go. I'm sorry about what happened to you. But the most important thing is you understand the life you once had is gone. The choice you have, is about the life you have next. What is this? A painting in a cave system in France. How old are we watching? A little over thirty thousand years. I spoke with Stewart on the way in. I saw him too. In the tunnel. He's quoting Shakespeare or something. So that's who it was. You know it's us, in caves. Homo sapiens. Same species. I found this little girl with a dog. That's nice. I mean it. Us, right? Yeah. I watched her for a while. Some of her life. She had five children. Died in her early thirties. You know it's strange, her people, our people, didn't live in caves for decades or centuries. It was millennia. I've been checking through the timelines. Some of the wall paintings are made 5000 years apart. Five thousand years. In the same place. Making the same images. How could nothing have changed in so much time? When I was a kid, the world changed every few years. These days... it changes every few months. Sometimes every few hours. Such acceleration. Maybe it stops tonight. Maybe it does. How long have we got? Lily will still be at home. She leaves in about ten minutes. What do we do? We watch dinosaurs. And then you make a joke about it not being as good as Jurassic Park. Then we end up watching some of your old home movies. Sounds okay. It is okay. Hey, I've got someone heading towards Devs. She's on the system as an employee, but I've got no record of her at Devs clearance. And the system's showing her as code green? Direct from the boss? Copy that, letting her through. I don't know you. You haven't been here before. No. What's your name? Lily. Lily. You seem like a nice young girl. I think you should turn around. This place will not be good for you. It's not good for anybody. What's inside? Everything. Everything is inside. I don't think I can turn around. Well... If you can't, you can't. That is the truth. That way.
