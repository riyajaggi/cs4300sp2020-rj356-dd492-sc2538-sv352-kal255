 ‐(laughs) ‐(music fades) (Stewart sighs) Ah! ‐(bottles clink) ‐(sighs) (door creaks, closes) (sighs) Hey, Stewart. (sighs) Lyndon, what the fuck? You scared the shit out of me. - Sorry. - How'd you get in? Did you bust it? I don't know, maybe. If I did, I'll buy you a new one. I can buy you a whole new home if you'd like.

 I don't want a new home. (bottles clinking) I need to talk to you. You're not allowed to talk to me. No one saw me get here. They don't know where I am. I bought a flight to LA, left all my hardware and then... hitched back up. "Hitched." Jesus. You scared? You want me to go? I'm not scared for myself, Lyndon. What did you want to talk about? I want you to speak to them. Or... speak to Forest and smooth it out. "Smooth it out"? Get me back into Devs. I don't think that's happening. That's my fucking life's work in there. - Lyndon, you're 19 years old... - No, I can't walk away. Einstein was 26 when he told us about relativity. - You've still got a bit of time. - But I have to be there! I'm the guy who cracked the problem. On a many worlds principle. Yes exactly! And it worked, beautifully. So what's the implication of that? He doesn't want many worlds. Just one. But there is no "just one." That's the point. If he doesn't like it, he's gotta change the laws of the fucking universe. He's a tech genius. Those laws are secondary. He's not a fucking genius, Stewart. He's an entrepreneur. And he's crazy. He's obsessive, he kills people. And he's trying to resurrect his daughter. (sighs) Just fucking ask yourself: Do you really want something as powerful as Devs in the hands of someone crazy? (sighs) (crickets chirping) What... What's going on? - What the fuck is going on? - JAMIE: Lily. - LILY: Where am I? - It's okay. You're safe. - We're in a motel. - What? We're in a motel. I didn't know where else to go, so I brought you here. - You brought me to a motel? - From the hospital. You were in a hospital. They put you there. The police, a doctor. (breathing heavily) The hospital. (sighs) You came to get me. You got me out. Chivalry. (scoffs) Yeah. Thank you. You were seriously wasted. I don't know what they gave you, some heavy fucking meds, but you've been sleeping it off for hours now. I brought you some clothes. (groaning) (sighs) Jesus. I feel sick. My mouth... tastes like metal. (breathing heavily) (bottle top clicking) What happened to your hand? Nothing. I just hurt it, while I was getting you out. (gulps) (sighs) Where are we? Napa. I would have driven further, but I didn't think anyone would find us here. And I wasn't really sure if the cops would be looking for my car, or where the hell we should be heading. Holy fucking Christ. What are we gonna do? Okay, so I was thinking maybe now we go to the media. The press. Something like that. We're telling them an escaped psychiatric patient has secret information about a murder conspiracy. No one's gonna listen, Jamie. Then we run. We can't use a credit card. We can't buy gas. We can't use a phone. Do you have any cash? Uh, 40 bucks. Then we aren't going to be running far. (sighs) Do we have enough gas to drive back into San Francisco? Yeah. Then I know where I'm gonna go. But you don't have to come with me, Jamie. - Seriously? - Yes, I'm serious. I can do this on my own. Okay, Lily. Yeah, that's... that's totally cool, I'll just hang out here and watch cartoons. You wanna text me when you're done? He's here. That's his car. Are you really gonna do this? We could at least wait until he gets up. (doorbell buzzes) (dog barking) (doorbell buzzing) FOREST: It's her. She's here. I think I heard something inside. Come in. Can I get you a drink? Think I've got some juice... beer, milk, or there's water. I'll take some water. Okay. How about you? Sorry, I don't know your name. Jamie. You work for me? No. I'm good. Lily wants to talk. Right. Why don't you let me do that. I came here to talk to him. If you came here for answers, you should talk to me. - KATIE: Maybe alone. - FOREST: Yeah. Come on, Jamie. We're being thrown out. It's a nice evening, we'll sit outside. Don't worry. She'll be fine. (door opens) (door closes) Let's sit down. What happened to your hand there? You hurt it? You fucking kidding me? Is that supposed to be a joke? No, not a joke. What do you mean? Your, uh, attack dog, Kenton, broke into my apartment, half‐drowned me in my own bathtub, and then bent back my finger until it snapped. Jesus Christ. (scoffs) You mean to telling me you didn't know? I knew he'd intimidated one of Lily's friends. I didn't know it was you. And I didn't know he'd... broken your hand. Yeah, well... I'm very sorry. It's not that I want these things to happen, or intend them to happen. You just let them happen. You observe from the side lines. Yeah, in a way. I don't understand why I'm not talking to Forest. I don't think you can answer my questions. I can. Who are you? - Katie. - Not your name. I work at Amaya. I'm the chief designer of the Devs system. You're Forest's girlfriend. "Girlfriend." Yeah, I guess I'm his girlfriend. I'm not sure the word totally works for me, but... whatever. Was there a judgment? Sleeping with the boss? He's vulnerable. Needs someone. I like it being me. I don't give a fuck who you're sleeping with. - I have other things on my mind. - Fair enough. Did you know Sergei? Your boyfriend. Did you know him? We had met. Briefly. What happened to him? You know what happened to him. I want you to tell me. On his first day at Devs, he tried to steal some of the source code of the project. He was caught when he tried to leave. So they killed him. "They"? They. Us... Me. I'm not trying to evade you. I wanna know who killed him. Kenton. If you mean the person who actually did it. How? You wanna know how he died? The means of it? Does it matter? He didn't burn to death. No. Then it was covered up. Yes. Made to look like suicide. Yes. But you know all this, Lily. Don't you? Yes. Then ask me what you don't know. What is Devs? Right... That. (crickets chirping) FOREST: I've got a feeling we're gonna be stuck out here a while. (sighs) We can sit here in silence if you want, that's totally cool. But the time will probably go quicker if we talk. Why don't you tell me your story? You work in tech? Yeah, web security. Where? David Wallace. Oh, yeah. I know those guys. Good outfit. You offence or defense? - Uh, defense. - You look like defense. And you're a friend of Lily's. Yeah. She's had it hard the last few days, I know that. (scoffs) Fuck off. Look, I'll do the small talk, if it gets us through the fucking weirdness of the situation, but... saying that Lily's had it hard the last couple of days... No, that"s too much of an understatement. I take your point. It's good you stick up for her. (chuckles) Yeah, Lily's pretty capable of sticking up for herself. Yeah. I see that. Does anything ever happen without a reason? What are you talking about? You wanna know what happens at Devs. I'll tell you, but I need to do it by asking you questions. I'm not here to play games. It's not a game. It's a way of explaining. Go with it. Go with it? Yes. Go with it. Okay? Okay. So... does anything ever happen without a reason? Yes. No. Things happen without a reason. Like? - An example? - Yes. A kid getting leukemia? Getting hit by lightning? It's an endless list. No, Lily. I didn't ask if things ever happen without a good reason. I said a reason. The leukemia was an aberration in the kid's DNA. The lightning was a static discharge. (sighs) Why did the pen roll across the table? You pushed it. Why did I push it? I'm guessing to make a point. That's a reason. It's why the pen rolled across the table. You blinked. What? Why did you just blink? Your eyes were dry. Or you were nervous. Does anything ever happen without a reason? There must be some events. Random events. Name a random event. Take a moment. Think about it, and then name one. A coin flip. A coin flip is not a random event, it's a complex event. How hard was the coin flipped? What was the weight of the coin? The air resistance? The temperature of the room? The angle it landed on the table? Okay, not a coin flip. But some things are random. Then name one. - Selection. - Selection of what? Selecting from things that are all the same. What things are all the same? Objects. Identical copies of a book at a bookstore. You chose the one beneath the top of the pile, because it had been handled less. (sighs) Meteors landing... Roulette wheels spinning... Misfortunes suffered... They can all be unraveled. You can't name a random event. Because there are no random events. You ask, what is Devs? (sighs) This is Devs. This is the only principle you need to understand. Nothing ever happens without a reason. Everything was determined by something prior. That's it. Now, take a computer. Give it all the data that can exist about this pen rolling across the table. Its trajectory, velocity, mass of its component parts, atomic structure. What can the computer now tell you? It can tell you how hard the pen was pushed, and it can tell you when the pen will stop rolling. The computer can see backwards. The computer can see forwards. Now do that with everything. Not just the pen. Everything. That's Devs. Powerful computer you've got there. It is. And you killed Sergei for that? Not exactly, Lily, no. I think for you... this will be where it gets hard. I guess she really loved that young man, huh? Sergei? Really cared about him. Yeah, she did. It's an amazing thing, where love'll take you. The road you'll travel. The lengths to which you'll go. You have it in your life? Uh, had. Oh. Well, better to have loved and lost. (scoffs) No? I'd go with: better to have loved and everything worked out totally fine. Okay, yes. Fair point. Me too. You know my loss. Everyone does. Uh... sure. I don't know yours. It doesn't compare. I'm very glad. Uh, yeah. It's just the... Just the standard, you know, losing a girl. Or, losing the girl and... the future you thought you had. Well, then it does compare, in that respect, at least. It's about coming to terms with that loss. I guess. (inhales deeply) But in all honesty, I... I never really did come to terms with it. You know, me and loss just kind of... Kind of coexisted. Loss as your friend and constant companion. (snickers) Yeah, type of friend that takes a dump on your face every morning. (laughs) That's the guy. Can I tell you something, Jamie? Which is a promise. Just a straight‐up promise, from me to you. Okay. It's all gonna work out just fine. What does that... What does that mean? What's gonna work out fine? Everything. That's the promise. Everything is gonna work out fine. The Devs system works. In fact, it's worked for a few months now. And it's getting better and more refined all the time. Even in the last 48 hours, we've had a significant breakthrough. On it, on the system... we can run predictions. They get fuzzier the further we go back in time, but, basically, you can pick any point in history and any adjusted GPS co‐ordinate on the planet, and we can run visualizations on it. "Visualizations"? Image. Sound. - You mean it's a simulation? - Exactly. A total simulation. From the quantum level to the macroscopic. The past and the future. The pen rolling backwards, the pen rolling forwards. You can look into the past. We've seen Christ on the cross. You can look into the future. We try not to. It's problematic. But, yes, we can. We have. You said for me, this'll be where it gets hard. Yes. Specifically hard for me? Specifically you, yes. Why? Why? When Devs first got up and running... we looked into the future and found we can only see a few months in advance. At a certain point, a fixed point, the visualization became pure static. Like a blizzard. The future was seeable right up to that moment... and after... impenetrable. The point of pure static has grown closer. It has never extended. Not even by a minute. Or a second. Now, the fixed point at which the future becomes lost... is very close. Twenty‐one hours. Tomorrow night? Tomorrow night. Just after one a. m... something happens. An unknown event. And it triggers a total breakdown in cause and effect. A breakdown of determinism, a breakdown of the literal laws of the universe. And we think it involves you. Me? How could you possibly think it involves me? You're there. - Where? - Devs. - I'm at the Devs lab? At Amaya? - Yes. But... We've seen you. You mean I cause the event? We think so. What do I do? We don't know. But whatever it is, it's significant. To say the least. (snickers) I don't understand. Nobody does. It's the only sport I could ever play. (grunts) Is Frisbee a sport? Oh, big sport. You don't watch the Olympics? What if you're wrong? Wrong? You. Your tech cult? Wrong? It's not me making the prediction. It's a machine. It's the universe. It's a machine making the prediction. What if the machine is wrong? What happens if I don't go to Devs tomorrow night? You will. What do you mean, I will? I mean exactly that. It's what is going to happen. You're gonna make me? Your gonna force me to go? No. I'm saying it's predetermined. It's always been predetermined. You were always going to go to Devs. That's ridiculous. You are not able to stay away. I could just choose not to go. - I could drive to Mexico. - No. - Set off right now. - But you won't. How the fuck can you tell me what I will or won't choose to do? I get it. What do you get? You're fucking delusional. This is bullshit. Lily, it's not material whether you believe me or not. It's going to happen. You're going to be there. I don't think so. Well... - I guess we'll see. - We will. Anything else you need to tell me? No. (door unlocks) (door closes) JAMIE: Nice. I got it. You... you okay? Yeah. Let's go. Right. - (car door slams) - (engine starts) So you're all buddies now. (clicks tongue) Should have fucking guessed. (engine starts) Think I wanna go home. Home? - Are you sure? - Yeah. You don't think people are gonna try to find us there? If they'd wanted to turn us in to the police or their own security, they already could've. That's not what's on their minds. What is on their minds? Madness. They're insane. Yeah. (dishes clink) ‐(glass thuds) ‐(water trickles) (gulps, sighs) Did you tell her about Sergei? Yes. And did you tell her about Devs? I told her everything. No. Not everything. Right. Yo, Lily! I've been worried about you, where you been hiding? Here and there. You"re out late tonight, right! I like it man. You know you gotta make the most of life while you can! Yeah. You should get some sleep, Pete. Yeah. Hey, don't worry. I remember our deal, man. I'm not talking to you. Nyet. Night, dude. (door closes) Hey. You ready to sleep? Jamie... Stay in my bed. It's okay. I can sleep here fine. No. Stay in my bed. I didn't know him. I thought I did. But really... I didn't. And all... this, everything that's happened since he died... it's sort of been for nothing. For something that... wasn't there. I didn't know him. I know you. So stay in my bed. (inhales sharply) They had guts, those two, coming here tonight. Yeah, they did. I like Jamie. He's brave enough to stand by her. Truly stand by her. There's a sort of sweetness in him too. They're brave kids. Seeing the heart of the storm. Just going straight to it. - That's her. Not him. - Yeah, I guess. She's smart. And strong as fuck. There's something else too. She has a strange quality. She's more afraid of not doing something than doing something. Not many people are like that. And there's a lot of truth in her. Not just in what she says, it's... the way she sees. She sees what's there. She didn't see it with Sergei. You know what I mean. Yeah, I do. So we like them. Uh‐huh. I like you, too. You do? Yeah. I'd say I'm... in like with you. Would that be deeply in like? Fairly deeply. That's generous. I'm in fairly deeply like with you too. I'm less fairly deeply. Just so you know. Sure. Hey. It's not long now. It's no longer years, or months, or days. It's hours, Forest. That's all. Hours.
