 (machinery humming) STEWART: The falcon cannot hear the falconer. Things fall apart... the center cannot hold. The best lack all conviction. The worst are full of passionate intensity. What rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem. To be born. (ambient music playing)

 (music rising) Hi, Lily. Come in. Where's Katie? Here. In the labs. We'll find her later. In about half an hour. I don't know what I am any more. Something that makes no decisions, has no choices, follows a path I can't see. I'm not even choosing the words I speak now. No.

 I've watched you speak these words before. Many times. And watched myself reply. As the words come, I don't feel as if I'm consciously repeating lines. They're just the things that, at this moment, I feel I want to say. You've taken everything from me. I'm sorry. I hope I don't sound unsympathetic, but I've taken nothing from you. I can't take what you never had. The sense that you were participating in life was only ever an illusion. Life is just something we watch unfold. Like pictures on a screen. This is what Devs makes? Yes. A film of your daughter? It's not a film, Lily. Determinism may be strange, but it's also beautiful. A small piece of information provides all information. The state of every particle is related to the state of the particles around it. Understand the state of one. Understand the state of the other. Keep going... know the state of everything. That's impossible. No. It's big data. The data of all things. Held. Owned. And that's not where it ends. That's where it starts. If you have all data, you have the emergent property of the data. The feel of her skin and hair. Her breath. The tone of her voice. Her thoughts and memories. Her love for me. Her knowledge of my love for her. It's not a film of Amaya. It is Amaya. She's alive. But she's not alive. She's a computer simulation. Explain the difference. She's going through fixed motions. As are you. As am I. As is everything else. Jamie said something to me this morning. He said... the problem with the people that run tech companies is that they become fanatics... end up thinking they're messiahs. (chuckles) This is the moment you take the gun out. The gun that Kenton used to kill Jamie. You take it out of your pocket. Where you were hiding it. Don't worry, you aren't about to use it. Not yet. You knew I was going to come here and you know what happens here. Every moment. But then it all stops working. I do something and your system breaks. Yes. What do I do? Don't tell me... Show me. Show me exactly what you've seen. Yeah. I'd try to talk you out of it, but... I already know I don't. Sit down. (panting) FOREST: (breathing heavily) (panting) I think we all know what we"re doing here. Then open it. What are you waiting for? - I don't know. - You're frightened. KATIE: I am frightened. Yes. However many times I've seen this... to be living it now... Don't worry. It'll be okay. KATIE: I don't know why you say that. Enough! This is too much. So... this is where you get in. And this is where we say goodbye. FOREST (on screen): Where do you think we're going, Lily? LILY (on screen): To your daughter's statue. Where you burned Sergei's body. FOREST (on screen): Where you will, what? Exact revenge. Lily, you know what to Messiahs, don't you? (breathing heavily) They get resurrected. Fuck you. (panting) Do it. - Do it. - (gunshot) (gasps) (panting) (breathing heavily) (alarm blaring) AUTOMATED VOICE: Vacuum seal broken. (alarm blares) Vacuum seal broken. Vacuum seal broken. (alarm continues on screen) (Lily panting) (inaudible) (static rising) I'm gonna die here. We die here. I kill us both. Yes. And nothing can change it. Nothing can stop it. Nothing. And we can't see beyond that moment in time. The predictions fail. Everything is lost. Do you know why you pull the trigger? It's for Jamie. So, when do we do this? How long do we have left to live? Only a few minutes, I'm afraid. That's all. Sorry. You do... don't you? You tech leaders... think that you're messiahs. I'll tell you a secret, Lily. I've been wanting to tell someone for a while. The name of the project. It's not Devs. The 'V' is Roman. So, actually, a "U." Deus. It was just a private joke. I think our time is up. Yes. It is. I think we all know what we"re doing here. Then open it. What are you waiting for? I don't know. LILY (through speaker): You're frightened. KATIE (through speaker): I am frightened. Yes. However many times I've seen this... to be living it now... FOREST: Don't worry. It'll be okay. I don't know why you say that! Enough! It's too much. (door hisses) So... this is where you get in. And this is where we say goodbye. That's not possible. We've left your system. Forest... you know the thing about Messiahs, don't you? They're false prophets. - (alarm blares) - (Forest panting) (capsule whirs) (both gasping) (alarm continues blaring) (both groaning) (choral music playing) (intercom beeps) (sobbing) (sobbing) What did you do? I disabled the electromagnetic field system on the capsule. Why? Because I realized... what we have done. Someone has to stop this. Don't blame me, Katie. It was predetermined. (whirring) (distortion) (distortion) (distortion) (coughs) KATIE: Forest. Katie? Where am I? Where are you? KATIE: I'm in the visualization chamber. You're on the screen. I'm in the system. What do you remember? I remember... everything. What the fuck did Lily do? KATIE: She made a choice. It's why we could never see beyond this point. She made an actual choice. (chuckles) All her talk of God and Messiahs... and look who she turned out to be. What do you mean? She committed the original sin. Disobedience. She did. Then it is Deus. It is Deus. And that means it's time. Within itself, the system is all‐knowing and all powerful. But only on Lyndon's principle. I need to know you understand precisely what that means? (sighs) Yes, Katie. I understand. Are you sure? Yes. I want them back so much. I know. (choral music playing) (scoffs) All right, fuck it. I guess wish me luck. I do. (choral music intensifies) (gasps, pants) Hey, what's up? Did you have a bad dream? ‐(breathing heavily) ‐(thuds) I don't know. Dude. Move, please. Yeah... (coughs) Sorry. Oh, hey, Lily. (grunts) You guys have a great day. Be all you can be. (chuckles) Forest. Forest. He just drove past. - (car horn honking) - Jesus, Lily! What's up with you? You've seen the guy walking around a thousand times! It was him? Of course. (Anya and Jen talking indistinctly) (Lyndon and Stewart talk indistinctly) So, I'll let you know how it goes, okay? - LILY: Sergei... - Yeah? Can I see something on your phone? On my phone? (snickers) What's this? You want to check my text messages? - Yes. - Really? What, you think I've got a little action on the side? Please. Okay. But there's nothing to see. I mean, you can't seriously think that there is. This is dumb. Just give me the phone back. - I want to open that app. - It's a fucking Sudoku game, what's the big deal? I really don't know what the fuck you're playing today, Lily. This is a big day for me, and you're screwing with it. Whatever. I've got to go. - I'll see you later, yeah? - Sure. (indistinct chatter, laughter) Hi, Lily. I don't understand what's happening. We died. Yes. Then, what is this? You don't know? We're in the system. Resurrection. As promised, remember? We're in Devs. - We're in Deus. - In the simulation. See it as an afterlife. Paradise. In this variation, anyway. You have your life back, Lily. Reinserted into existence, a couple of days before Sergei was killed. You can pick up from where you left off... if that's what you want. S... Sergei doesn't know? That he's in a sim? No. (indistinct chatter) LILY: Do they know? (laughs) No one knows. Just you and me. I asked Katie to resurrect us using data from the moment of our death. So, our memories leading up to that moment were kept intact. That's the cross we have to bear. But it's worth it. You get used to it. We are now living in many worlds. In this world, the two of us get to live in Paradise, with the ones we love. In other worlds, it will be closer to Hell. For those other harder lives we have to lead, I thought knowledge would be a comfort. I don't know if that's right, but it was the choice I made. Just thought I'd exercise a little free will. And in any case... there's something special about you, Lily. Something truly unique. Something... I did not want to change. Hey, smile. (chuckles) We lucked out. This life is one of the good ones. What's the matter? I don't know what to do now. That's easy. You do what you always do... you follow your own path. That's exactly what's special about you. I'm sure I'll see you around. Let's get coffee some time. LAINE: So existing inside the Deus simulation feels exactly like existing in reality? It would be indistinguishable. Effectively, the simulation and reality are identical. Outside of the people who directly work here, who else knows about this? No one. I just need you to help me. To keep it switched on. (squealing and laughing) Daddy! (giggling) (sobs) (siren blaring in distance) Jamie. (indistinct chatter in background) (emotional music plays)
