 Criminals frighten me. You? They make me break out. M-My face... My face breaks out. We haven't come here to discuss breakouts. Mr. Cage, Michael Huttle. Thanks for coming. My associate, Ally McBeal. Hi. Hi. We don't really specialize in criminal law, Mr. Huttle. I realize this, but this case isn't going to come down to straight criminal law. - We need something unorthodox. - Wh-What did he do? Eighteen years ago, he robbed a bank. And they just caught him now? No. He's been in prison this last 18 years. Did he, like, shoot everybody and leave them all bullet-ridden on the bank floor... with, like, blood everywhere?

 Well... [Stammers] Well, we need the facts. No. He didn't shoot anybody. He served all of his time... Leastwise, almost all of it. A month prior to his release, he tried to escape. He faces charges on that. He served 18 years and tried to escape with a month to go? How stupid is that? [Scoffs] Why do you want us? If he's convicted of trying to escape, and I can't see why he wouldn't be... he did make it over the wall... He'll get hit with the remaining 12 years of his sentence. He's 72 years old. He'll die in prison. What do you want us to do? Whatever it is you do that makes juries disregard the law. Uh... Uh... I'm sorry? Well, pinch your nose. Get it to whistle. Take a moment. Make your feet squeak.

 My client needs somebody to pull a rabbit out of a hat. Now, I'm told you can do it. Say it with me. [Both] Troubled. On the day of the trial they want the Biscuit to take over the case? On the very day of the trial? Evidently, they have no defense. And they figure, who better to go in with nothing than John Cage? Ally's with him. They're at the prison now. And the trial starts at 2:00. Georgia. Uh, Marcia Halliday... New client. 10:00. Wants to sue her ex-fiancé for emotional distress. Will you meet with her? Knew you would. Thanks. What did the ex-fiancé do? Stiffed her at the altar. Her scorn is our profit. If she's ugly, say yes. Wait, wait, wait! If she's ugly, say yes? Right. And if she's not ugly? Don't take the case. Duty to mitigate. If she's pretty, she can find someone else to marry her. If she's a dog, there's more money in it. Use your discretion. No points for personality.

Does... Yes. I just blink more when... It's a little Tourette's-ian. Uh, I pick up on the body movements of others, and unconsciously I... But... When I'm in trial with Ally, my hands swish. It's non-intentional. - He's very peculiar. - Yeah. ♪♪ [Humming, Stammering] Poughkeep... Poughkeep... Poughkeep... Poughkeep... - Just New York. - He does this in court too. But I think it's on purpose. Is it on purpose? No. He used to have a stutter, but he corrected it. Or I should say he controlled it with a song... ♪♪ [Humming] And then he picked "Poughkeepsie" to preempt the... ♪♪ [Humming] But, you know, Poughkeepsie is actually a town in Upstate New York, so he seized upon... "New York" instead of "Poughkeepsie" because it's phonetically less jarring. Now, he is an excellent, excellent lawyer. He's just nervous around, um, criminals. Right, John? Mets. [Elevator Bell Dings] Duress? That's all I can think of. He had no choice but to jump over the wall? Based on what he told me, I'd prefer you not being at the table. What? Why? We need to appear the underdog. Three lawyers is too many, especially given your... considerable girth. Look. I know the facts. Of course I'm gonna be at the table. John? John? It is you! Hayley! I'm the D.A. on the Robbins case. I just saw the appearance filed John Cage. I can't believe it! My God! How are you? Well, I'm a little pressed for air. I just got transferred back here from North Hampton. - Hi. Hayley Chisolm. - Hi. Ally McBeal. Hayley and I were classmates in law school. Are you first-chairing? Uh, I am. I don't believe it! [Giggles] [Chuckles] We had this thing we'd do. When we got excited, we'd do this little hop. Remember, when we walked into our torts final, we did the hop? Mmm. Huh? Oh, he's very funny. Do you know how funny he is? - I've seen some hints. - Oh, my little Biscuit. Oh, this'll be such a treat. [Sighs] Old friends, huh? Okay. I know you're hurt. The question you really have to ask yourself... Will suing him make me feel better? Will suing him make you... feel better? He didn't just break up with me. He left me at the altar. The minister, the 300-plus guests, the flower girls, the bridesmaids, my mother... all there. It's not legal to sever a man's penis. I know this. I actually hired a lawyer to look it up. Here's the problem. Courts don't like emotional distress claims when it comes to love lives. Especially marriages. They basically think you're trying to find blame, which defeats the purpose of no-fault. I understand. But I would just think... if you could get the judge to see the lawsuit... as an alternative to castration, he might look more favorably on it. I see. Can I be candid with you, Georgia? And so far you haven't been? In addition to losing the love of my life, I was utterly humiliated. 300 people in that church looked at me with one common feeling... pity. Maybe I should just get counseling. No. No. Mm-mmm. Counseling won't help you. Your instincts are right, Marcia. May I call you Marcia? I guess, but my name is Mary. Huh. In every person's life, there comes a time... when you have to go forth and be vicious. [Exhales] This man... I'm sure he's a good man at heart... maybe even a kind man. But he needs to suffer. He was building a chest in shop class. This I knew. A chest? Yeah, a hope chest. He said it was for his granddaughter. Except it was wide. It was huge and square. Hmm. And how did he get it out in the yard? This I don't know. He must have had help. Tell us exactly what you saw. Well, it was nighttime, and I was in the tower, and I looked over, and I saw him jumping on it. It was a trampoline. He'd made himself some kind of trampoline. And he was jumping higher and higher. - And then what? - And then I yelled, but he kept on jumping. And that's when I suddenly realized what was going on. And then up he went, right over the wall. - And then what? - Then we went out and retrieved him. He wasn't going anywhere. He sprained his ankles. Thank you, sir. [Clears Throat] My name is John Cage, sir. How do you do? I'm fine. Splendid. Nothing further. [Spectators Murmuring] Ah, boy, you really got me there, John. I had no idea you'd actually tell the witness your name. Hayley, what is the point of this? He served his term. Well, it's not up to me. Prison escapes. Office policy. We have to come down hard. - Twelve years? - Sorry. - You look great. - Well, thank you. Um... Uh, how is, uh, Fred? Ah, divorced. You know. It's hard working and... You married? No. Anybody? I, uh... No. Know what, John? Best relationship I ever had with a man was you. There's something to be said for platonic friendships. They don't disappoint. Yeah. Hey. [Giggles] Any luck? Hi. Uh, office policy. Prison escapes, you know. I'll promise not to do my best. Does she know? Know what? That you were in love with her. I wasn't in love with her, Ally. Mm-hmm. You think she knows? I... Uh... Uh... Poughkeep... Poughkeep... Uh, uh... Giuliani. Ms. Halliday, I'm Elaine Vassal. Perhaps you've heard of me. Not really. I'm surprised. Anyway, I want you to know I share your pangs of loneliness. And I thought, well... I have invented a husband CD. It can bring a lot of relief. A husband CD? All the sounds of a spousal relationship. You can carry it in your pocket. Track one... Your husband opening the car door for you like a perfect gentleman. [Car Door Opens, Closes] [Bell Dings] Him sleeping next to you. [Snoring] Tracks three through six... Normal husband sounds heard around the house. [Toilet Flushing] [Crowd Cheering] ♪♪ [Organ: "Charge"] [Farting] Some of it's coarse, but it is a marriage. Hmm. From the day I got there, the only thing I could do is think about getting out. Of prison. I would just collect rubber bands. When I got my hands on some, I'd hoard 'em. Rubber bands. Sometimes there would be one around some papers I got from the library, or a fellow prisoner would slip me one. Visitors could smuggle in a whole handful. [Chuckles] I bribed one inmate with braces to give me all he had. Every day I'd collect rubber bands and dream about a trampoline. I could just see myself going over that wall. You know, building that box in the shop... That was easy. But collecting those rubber bands... It took me 18 years to get enough. How did you keep them a secret? As I was knitting them together, I was also knitting an afghan to conceal them. And finally I finished. I had a blanket of rubber bands to put on that chest to make a trampoline. - When did you finish? - January. - A month prior to your release date? - Yes. Mr. Robbins, I have to ask the question that's on everybody's mind. Or, actually, I don't, do I? Why? That's what I said. Only a month to go. What good does it do? Forget it! I did. Then suddenly... part of me just went dead. Eighteen years of planning toward something, wondering whether you can actually do it. When I went out that night, I said to myself, "Just see. You don't actually have to go over. But just see." And I kept going up. I felt like I... I was flying. [Chuckles] But I couldn't know. I... I had to try to go over. Now, I knew it would be stupid, but I thought I had wings, and... My moment was here. Eighteen years. And the next thing I knew, I was going over the top. [Chuckles] I landed with a huge thud. And I just lay there. I thought I'd broken every bone in my body. But in my mind, I've never been more free. I was free forever. [Sniffling] Oh! This is one of the reasons why I get transferred. I just keep crying when I hear the defendant's story. A D.A. shouldn't do this. Last year I was in juvie. This boy burned down a neighborhood. He talked about his abusive parents. On cross, I offered to adopt him. - Hayley, look at me. - Hmm? - Please. - Oh, all right. She likes to lull defense attorneys with false sympathy. Then, in summations, she laments the demise of the death penalty. I forget who I'm up against. He knows all my secrets. - Do you know all of his? - Uh, uh, uh... Knickerbockers. What? Nothing. - Well... - [Whirring] I don't have any rebuttal witnesses, so I'll cross your guy, then I'm ready to close. [Whirring] - Ready? - All set. Hey, Hayley, a bunch of us are going out to eat tonight from work. Why don't you come with us? No talking about the case. Oh, I'd love to, but I'm in Lamaze class tonight. I'm trying to take it seriously. You know, it's important. [Stammering] You're, um, pregnant? Oh, Lord, no. But one day I hope to be. And when I am, who's got time to hang around with a bunch of fat cows trying to breathe? Oh. [Laughs] Well, well, come on. Come with us. Well, maybe I could blow off one class. We're going to attach his house? Just in case he becomes judgment-proof. We don't want to wind up with an empty bag. Neither did he. Kidding. Bygones. Off we go. By going for a real estate attachment, we can get an automatic hearing. You've got another hour. The motion's scheduled for 10:00. You think the judge will actually put a lien... Probably not. We'd have to show likelihood of victory on the merits. Our claim's a little out there. But this will do is kick-start the war. In a way, it'll make you feel married to him. You know, I'm beginning to have second thoughts. Never trust second thoughts. Where there's two, there's three. You'll end up thinking forever. Only think about this: You were about to take wedding vows with this man. "Death us do part." You parted. What's holding up death? - Huh? All right. - [Elevator Bell Dings] Why did you do that? I had a feeling. Well, well, I-I should say that you had a feeling, but I am the kind of person who acts on feelings, even if they're not my own. Ally... She hops. She has a briefcase remote. She takes Lamaze. And-And she's-she's-she's... Say it. A little kooky. - You never went out? - No. And you never, um, asked her out in any other way than a pluton way? Platonic? I did once. Well, what happened? - Well... - What? First, how did you... How did you... Could... How could you tell? [Chuckles] Well, just like you can tell when I'm seeing something, I can tell what's going on with you. A while ago... I think this was at the Christmas party... you said I was odd. But like it was a-a special thing to be. It is. S-S-Sometimes. Well, most people look at me like I'm odd-strange, not odd-special. You were the first person since Hayley to... She got me. She really did. I've never laughed with anybody so... So why didn't you ever... I was afraid that I would spoil it. I mean, that's not some bell you get to un-ring. And I did ask... one week before the graduation. And? I tried to guise it as sort of a joke. I mean, half serious, half joke. That way, if she wasn't interested, I could lay it off to... as... No, I told her what a great friendship it was, and how I thought maybe that we should be a couple. Unfortunately, she thought that was my best joke yet. [Groans] And she never knew that you weren't joking? I don't think so. Well, well, then, John, you never really took a chance. I opened the door. The door came back to strike me in the nose. - Even so, you-you-you... - Well, she met the love of her life. And she got married. And now she's divorced. John, I'm, um, pretty much over Billy 99.60%. But there will come a day when I will be totally over him. But you know what I will never get over? Greg? Glenn? No. No, no. The-The idea that when Billy left, I... I just let him. So what that my heart got crushed? I-I just protected my ego at all cost. Well, well, that was me... at my most... foolish. And I have set records in... in that department. [Sighs] If your feelings are a fraction of what... my... Oh, John, you've got to take a chance. You have to. You are actually gonna bill the client for this little exercise in futility? We'll know soon enough if we're gonna get kicked. What concerns me here, Georgia, is your outlook. My outlook? Yes. Instead of saying, "Nobody's ever won this kind of case," you could have said, "Nobody's ever won this kind of case." There's joy in being a pioneer, blazing a trail. Give me your shoe. No. [Bailiff] All rise. Your problem is you keep harping on merits. Things don't turn on merits, Georgia. This is a court of law. Things turn on juries. Things turn on judges. [Bailiff] The Honorable Judge Cone presiding. And occasionally things turn on me. [Georgia] Perhaps you should recuse yourself. Why? Yes, why? Why? You want me to say the reason in open court? The fact that I had alleged sexual relations... with your co-counsel doesn't render me impartial. Truth be told, it was so unremarkable, I can barely remember it. I'm not one to hang on to trivia. [Georgia] Ah. - I'm glad you have no bias. - May I speak, Your Honor? Given the lunacy of this case, I fully expected you to do the speaking. Yes. Excellent. Verbal spankings leave me wanting for more. But let's address the merits of the case. This case has no merits. Courts don't step in to protect jilted brides. Courts don't legislate love. The whole point behind no-fault divorce is so the courts don't get involved in finger-pointing. They teach that second year of law school. Did you make it that far, counsel? Actually, I did, Your Honor, and one of the perks... of sleeping with judges is you get to see how the law really works. As for the idea that courts never get involved in love or marriage, that's nonsense. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you've spent... - too much time up close to a hair dryer. - Hey! Let's just sort of spit out the legal arguments, then we can turn to spitting on each other. I'll see counsel in chambers. We'll do it there. [Door Closes] Pro forma. Very common. You were convicted of robbing a bank 18 years ago. - Is that right, Mr. Robbins? - Yes. - Did you use a weapon while robbing that bank? - Yes. And, Mr. Robbins, when you took your little trampoline out to the yard, you did so with the intent to escape, didn't you? Objection. "Intent" is a legal term. She's trying to trick the witness into... saying he intended something, when all he felt was a compulsion to clear the wall. - He had no control. - Objection. He's testifying. I object to the trickery... He coached the witness on how to answer the question. - That is outrageous. - All right. [Both] Unacceptable. [Clears Throat] I knew when you got up, you were gonna start testifying. He did that in mock trials. And you had to bring up weapons, didn't you? Loves guns. Hey, you know what I'm gonna do next? I'm gonna tell your client my name! Very funny. Hayley. Yeah, that'll get him. Neither of us want that man to die in jail, do we? If you believe he should get 12, that's one thing. But office policy? That's not you. I'll give you four. It's the best I can do. Thanks. I can't believe we said "unacceptable" at the exact same time! - Exact. - [Both Laughing] Don't get me wrong. I'm tickled by your position. It's just perhaps there is some bias here. My bias is against the legitimacy of the suit. Though I have to admit the one bringing it doesn't add to its credibility. - Whipper. - Judge Cone. Judge Cone... Your Honor... courts delve into marriage all the time. They enforce the prenups, alimony... A jilted bride sues a man for not showing up... It's different. I know. But let's not start off with the premise that courts don't get involved. They do. And when it comes to child support, the courts are perfectly willing to entertain finger-pointing. We are talking about something way different here. Yes, it's different, but they get in there. There may be presumptions as to when they stay hands off, but there are no rules. It comes down to fairness. Fairness started palimony suits. Fairness gave rights to same-sex unions. It comes down to the case. And in this case, my client, who paid for the wedding, was hung out like a wet "binky" on the steps of the church. Fairness doesn't say "look the other way." The duty of a court... a judge... Is to see wrong and try to right it. That doesn't change when you've had sex with one of the lawyers! Under that robe, besides a phenomenal body, is a good judge. Behave like one. [Door Opens, Closes] Four years is... That is the best we can do. - I think we have to consider it, Vincent. - No. If we lose, we... We... ♪♪ [Humming] Mr. Cage, I don't expect you to understand this, but going over that wall... was the first thing in my life I ever truly followed through with. You followed through with robbing the bank. To tell the truth, I went along with the robbery, but I hardly... I had to go over that wall. For once in my life, I...

Technically, you're right. Our case stinks. But why apply reason or logic? I suppose it's a habit. [Richard] Take marriage itself. Is it logical? People aren't even evolved fully as individuals in their 20s and 30s, and this is the time they choose to partner up with compatible soul mates. Science alone tells you physical attraction can't last. A person would never even buy a car if he were told he had to drive it the rest of his life. Marriage, like law, offers the illusion of wonderful ideology, but in the end, stripped down... money. - Give it to us. - [Knocking] Could I interrupt? I didn't recuse myself because I thought the claim was baseless. Any bias I might have would be irrelevant. But as I sat down and considered some of the atrocities spewing from plaintiff's counsel, I am forced to admit... the courts are all over the institution of marriage. And tort law does seem to be expanding into broken hearts. Inasmuch as the claim may be colorable, I do hereby recuse myself.

Oh, I don't know. You ever think about joining one of those dating services? Are you serious? We hate dating. You kill the inflatable man. We go to the bar three nights a week. We never meet anybody. 'Cause we sit at tables. If we really want to meet people, we need to sit at the bar. Syd Sharpie joined. She gave me her tape. [Laughs] Her-Her-Her tape? You get to see the guys on video. When you think about all the time it saves, it makes sense. [Man On TV] A man has to protect his woman. I like to sniff my date's food to make sure it's not putrid. Old eggs get washed. Expiration dates get changed. I always sniff the girl's eggs. To not do so would be rude. I gotta go peel my face. Boy, it seemed almost romantic, didn't it? That trampoline? You know, the way he went up and up, and then over. The triumph of the human spirit. It's easy to look at it that way. And if you do... - Bad jury! Bad! - Objection. - Yes. We'll sustain that. - The truth is, I kind of look at it that way too. Look at him. He's even a little adorable. And 72. It's hard to put him back in jail. But he broke a law. As cute as he may be, I have a job to do. So do you. He had to go over that wall. Eighteen years... collecting those rubber bands. To survive in prison, you need hope. And for nearly two decades, he fixed all his hope on just one single moment. And when that moment finally came, how could he not seize it? [Nose Whistles] The thing about hope... Many people secretly wish... that that moment never does present itself. Because if it does, well, there's a chance the hope could be dashed. Now, I knew a man who was secretly in love with a woman... who was his best friend. But he never dared tell her... for fear she wouldn't return his feelings. For fear she'd stop being his best friend. I think also he never asked her because, well, sometimes the... The beauty of not knowing... Hope lives. But courage... Now, courage is when the time comes to jump, and you jump. Courage is knowing you can't not jump. Somewhere out there there's a man with a heart... Maybe not broken. Certainly not... not content. Who wishes he'd met Vincent Robbins. Maybe things would be... He would salute Vincent Robbins. Yes, he would. [Silverware Clattering] You get it? This way, you're never eating alone. You just play this. If you don't look up, you'd never know he wasn't really there. [Burping, Echoes] There's too much reverb there. It's fixable. Okay, Elaine. Thank you. Off you go. We still don't know who the case is being transferred to, but the delay helps. It actually gives us some time to negotiate a settlement. The risk that we might actually survive a motion to dismiss gives us some leverage. Actually, I've decided to drop the suit. What? Why? How? We haven't even got your fiancé to the chamber yet. The reason I wanted to sue... Redemption, revenge, retainer. Yes. Besides all that, I felt sorry for myself, and... What? My love for him was real. My pain was real. Of course. That's why we're here for you. Yeah. Well, listening to you negotiate... The illogic of marriage, how love is illusory, stripped down it's all money... Suddenly I don't feel sorry for myself anymore. I feel sorry for you. Uh, Mary, it's my job as counsel to caution you toward reason. You may side with reason. You may even be right. I don't know. What I do know: You certainly don't represent me. [Sighs] She looks so unhappy. I think I'll send her a CD. Maybe that... Shut up, Elaine! What, you think the cure to somebody's loneliness is a compact disc? What, that's your answer? [Sighs] God, uh... I'm sorry. [Chuckles] I don't have the answers, Richard. Maybe you could let me in on your secret. Boo. Oh! Oh! [Laughs] Unacceptable. Oh. John, I was very, very moved by your closing. Thank you. That man you knew... Were you... Were you talking about who I... Oh, uh... Yes. All that time you were in love... with me? Only at the very... Yes. Well, you know I loved you too. But not... in maybe the way you mean. Of course. Oh, I know that. I know. You were the best friend I ever had, John. And running into you again... You know, even after years of not talking, it's like we were never apart. But... Hayley... Hayley, I'm not asking you for anything. I valued your friendship, and that's... I just didn't want to jeopardize... John. Hey. It was a closing argument. I'm trying to win an acquittal for my client. Don't read too much into it. Okay. [Door Opens] Hey! Hey, jury has a verdict, and the judge is bringing them back in 20. I should tell my client. Yeah. If you'll excuse me. Sure. Yeah. [Spectators Murmuring] What does it mean when they come back fast? When we win, it's great. And if we lose? It's terrible. I can't go back to prison again. If he says "guilty," I'm gonna make a run for it. Are you with me? You go ahead. I'll catch up. [Bailiff] All rise. - Mr. Foreman, you've reached a unanimous verdict? - We have, Your Honor. - What say you? - The Commonwealth vs. Vincent Robbins, on the charge of attempted escape from a state penitentiary, we find the defendant, Vincent Robbins, - not guilty. - Oh! [Laughing] Congratulations. There's a rabbit from a hat, huh? - [Judge] This jury is dismissed. - I gotta look for a job. Well, there are plenty of banks to hit. Just kidding. [Huttle Laughs] You beat me, Biscuit. Well... [Chuckles] Congrats. Thank you. Hey, lunch tomorrow? Let me check my book. I'll let you know. Great. Great. John? Congratulations. Yeah. How'd it go? We won. You did? Well, I-I-I should say that John won. He was the most brilliant. Straight not guilty? He was fabulous. [Elevator Bell Dings] Oh, damn it. What's that about? I'm here to sign the dismissal papers. Oh, yes. Um, Elaine will help you with that. - Hey. - Don't want to talk about it. I-I understand, but... Ally, I don't want to talk about it! Sometimes I feel better not talking! That thing about talking making you feel better? That was made up by a bunch of yappers! I want to be by myself, with myself. Would that be all right with you? Yes. Ally? Mm-hmm? [Clears Throat] Thank you for... Thanks. [Sighs] Uh, I know you're not the judge anymore, but there's a couple of things I'd like to enter into record. [Clears Throat] First, I realize... when, uh, people who love each other, uh, part, you know, no court of law can fix it. Second, I know it's a slippery slope... when you start asking judges to legislate, uh, couples. And, uh, third, uh... [Exhales] I miss you.
