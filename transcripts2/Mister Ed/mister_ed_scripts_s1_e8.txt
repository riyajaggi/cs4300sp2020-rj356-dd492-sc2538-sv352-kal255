 ♪ Talk to Mister Ed ♪ Get back in the barn, Ed. That was no horse. That was my wife. Lemonade and cookies for the master of the house. Hmm... [smacks lips] Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh. You're not going to lift a finger during your vacation. Nobody has worked harder than you have finishing those plans for the Quaker Medical Building. Another bite of cookie, please? You're not going to do a thing. Napkin. Yes, My Lord. Just rest and enjoy the sun.

 Now I want you to take a nice long nap. - Carol. - Yes, dear? Close my eyes. [sighs] Boy, this is what I call living. Not enough sugar. Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Did I disturb you? How was the lemonade? Not enough sugar. Oh, would you like another glass? No, thank you, honey. Well, you just relax. Rest. Isn't she a wonderful wife? Boy, there's nothing like marriage. Big deal. One week off, 51 weeks slaving. No, you're wrong, Ed. It's a great life. Uh-oh. There's nothing like having a wonderful wife... someone to come home to at night, someone to share your sorrows, your joys, your... You've been out in the hot sun too long. - Hi, Roger. - Maybe a week's vacation isn't enough. Sit down, neighbor. Oh, no. I couldn't get up again. - Where's Kay? - Probably looking for me. My dear wife has had me rearranging furniture all morning. Not again. You're probably ready for a week's rest yourself. If that woman has me move one more stick of furniture... Hello, dear. Where do you want me to move the couch? Addison, doll, I just realized where the piano really belongs. Carnegie Hall? Near the bookshelf, and I promise you, sweets, this will be the last move. It better be because the next move is me out of the house. Oh, come on, muscles. [phone rings] Yes? - It's for you. - Thanks, Ed. Hello? Wilbur, honey. This is your Aunt Martha. Aunt Martha? Well, where are you calling from? From the railroad station, dear. The railroad station? Yes. Didn't you get my letter? No, Aunt Martha. We weren't expecting you, but it's wonderful. I'll be right down to pick you up. - How's Carol? - Oh, she's fine, Aunt Martha. Look, where do I pick you up? Well, I'll meet you where they stack the trunks and suitcases. The old bag up front will be your Aunt Martha. Goodbye, dear. I won't be long. Oh, my. One does get so ruffled, doesn't one? Right this way, Aunt Martha. Thank you, dear. You know, I simply cannot understand what could have happened to my leather. - It must've gotten lost. - That's not important. How long will you be able to stay with us, Aunt Martha? Oh... Oh, I just love the house! [parrot] Stick them up! Stick them up! Oh, isn't Tootsie clever? It's a holdup! It's a holdup! Where did she learn that? Oh, she just loves to watch those detective stories on television. [Carol] Oh, how cute. Isn't it amazing how a bird can talk? I don't know. I got a horse who... Drinks lemonade, eats hay, trots. That's my Wilbur. He still has the same imagination he had as a little boy. Don't you, Weebie? Weebie? [Aunt Martha] When Wilbur was a little boy... Please, Aunt Martha... He was so cute. I used to bounce him up and down on my knee, and I'd say, "What's your name, honey?" Well, he couldn't say "Wilbur," so he used to say, "Weebie." Weebie! Weebie! - Shall we go in? - Yes. Look at that gorgeous back yard. You know, that's what I've always missed back home... A large backyard. Wilbur did all the landscaping himself. - He did? - That's right, and it only cost me $200 more than if I'd hired a gardener. That's my same little Weebie. Honey, would you please get the suitcases? - Yeah. - Aunt Martha? - Yes, dear. - I'll show you to your room. I'm sure after that long trip you'd like a nice rest. Rest? With all the wonderful places there are to see in California? Oh, no, my dear, not at all. Now, then, I made out a little list. Aunt Martha, this week is Wilbur's vacation. Oh, how wonderful. Then I won't be interfering with your work while you're showing me around. That's right, Aunt Martha. Isn't it, Carol? Yes, Weebie. - Aunt Martha... - Yes, dear. - The bedroom's upstairs I'll show you to it. - Oh, fine. I'd like to take my jacket and hat off if it's all the same to you, dear. You know, darling... [continues chattering] I'll get the suitcases. Anybody home? [Tootsie] Stick them up! Stick them up! It's a holdup! It's a holdup! Don't shoot. Please, don't shoot. Stick them up! Stick them up! They are. My money's in my left hand pocket. Stick them up! Stick them up! Don't do anything rash, Wilbur. D-Don't do anything rash. Get your hands up. Roger, are you afraid of that loudmouth bird? Well, I... when I get through with him, he'll be behind bars. Don't antagonize him. He's armed. Look behind you. It's a parrot. What? Then who took my money? I did, doll. There's $20 missing. [squawks like a parrot] It's a holdup! It's a holdup! If I had pretty Polly, I'd have a mink coat in no time. I'd have him stuffed. Where did you get him, Wilbur, in a police lineup? Him's a her. Tootsie. Aunt Martha's parrot. Aunt Martha? Having company? Just arrived. She's a wonderful person, practically brought me up. Ah, here she is. Hi. Auntie, I'd like you to meet my wonderful neighbors Kay and Roger Addison. This is my Aunt Martha. - How do you do? - How do you do? - How do you do? - How do you do? Any friend of Weebie's is a friend of mine. Weebie? Oh, that's what he called himself when he was a baby. He couldn't say "Wilbur." - Oh, how precious. - Just adorable. He was the most beautiful child I ever saw. He had gorgeous blue eyes and long lashes and a head full of golden curls. Long lashes and golden curls. What a shame I didn't know you then. I wasted my youth on Mary Pickford. Shall I take the parrot up to your room, Aunt Martha? Oh... Now, we're going to be out most of the time, and I wouldn't want Tootsie to be alone. Oh, we could put her in the barn with our horse. A horse? Why, that's perfect. Tootsie loves animals. Good. Let's go, Tootsie. [mutters] Oh... Wilbur is my favorite nephew. I just know I'm going to enjoy this visit. How long are you staying, Aunt Martha? Uh, well, that depends. Carol, I must look with you. Certainly, Aunt Martha. This way for the 25-cent tour. [Tootsie squawks] Stick them up! It's a holdup! It's a hole up! Stick them up! [squawking] A talking bird. What will they think of next? Ed, this is Tootsie, Aunt Martha's parrot. Tootsie's going to be staying with you for a while. Well, who sent for her? Stick them up! Stick them up! Oh, shut your cotton-picking beak. You might learn a few things from Tootsie. She seems to be a very smart bird. Then what's she doing in jail, hmm? Come on, Tootsie. There. We'll put your right over there. Honey, I've started lunch. Anything special? Anything. Where's Aunt Martha? In the living room, adding to that list of places she wants to see. Kay and Roger went home. Excuse me. Darling, it's your vacation. - Don't you think... - Honey, it's her first trip out here. Dear, she's a very sweet person, but you've been working so hard. You need the rest. I'll get it when she leaves. From the looks of that list, that won't be till after Christmas. You're just exaggerating. Look, I'll show you how tired I am... There's my Tootsie? Oh. Well, now, you mustn't be bashful in front of me. Go ahead, Wilbur, smooch. Why, Wilbur, you're blushing. Oh, he always was shy. I remember when he was four-years-old with a birthday party. A little girl tried to kiss him, and he ran away and hid under the bed. [chuckles] What's so fun... What do you think of Mister Ed? Oh, he's a beautiful animal, but you can't beat a parrot when it comes to cleverness. You are so right. [blows raspberry] Well, I better start lunch. Then later we can all sit on the patio and relax. Relax? What are we, a bunch of old fogies? Oh, no. Now, let's start doing the town right after lunch. Wilbur is a bit tired and was planning to take it easy today. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, dear. I didn't realize that. Well, now, don't you worry, Wilbur. I can manage. Well, wait a minute, though. I think I better drive, yes? You don't have to, dear, although the Addisons and I will miss you. The Addisons? Yes, yes, I invited them along, too. They're such a friendly couple. Well, then it's only fair that we go in our car. Right, Carol? Of course. Oh, there, Weebie. You've got yourself a wonderful wife. Come on, dear. I'll help you fix lunch. Weebie? [guffaws] Stick them up! Stick them up! Oh, knock it off, stupid. Stick them up! Stick them up! It's a holdup! It's a holdup! [squawks] Stick them up! Stick them up! It's a holdup! It's a holdup! [squawking] Oh, you would taste good barbecued. Ed, would you quit teasing Tootsie? This bird's driving me nuts. Ed, you've been beefing for three days. She's kept me up for three days. Look at the circles under my eyes. You're just going to have to put up with Tootsie, that's all. Stick them up! Stick them up! Shut up. Is that all you know? Good news, Wilbur. Stick them up! That's the second time in three days she's held you up. Your Aunt Martha has just given us today's itinerary. Oh, no. We've been on the go ever since she got here. So far the only thing I haven't seen is the city dump. That's your first stop. - Aw... - No, seriously, today she intends seeing Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland. Well, what's the good news? I'm not going. How did you get out of this? [Aunt Martha] Wilbur, are you in there? Yes, Aunt Martha. Wilbur, dear, we're all ready to go to... Oh, poor Roger. How's your neck now, dear? Still stiff. No, I'm awfully sorry I won't be able to go with you. I've always wanted to see the city dump. Oh, poor man, what he's going through. All right, Wilbur, Come on. Carol's waiting. Yes. [groans] What's the matter, darling? [grunting] M-My back, I sprained it. Oh, I know how to fix that. Turn around, dear, and let your arms hang. - Yeah, well... - That's it. - [back crackling] - Oh! Oh! [sighs] There, now. I told you we'd be home before midnight. You're right, Aunt Martha. It's just two minutes to 12:00. We were lucky. Customs guard at the border let us right through. Well, he knew I was an American the minute I said, "Merci beaucoup." Isn't he cute? Did I ever tell you I used to bounce him up and down on my knee - when he was a little boy? - Yes, you did, Aunt Martha. He was such a joy. He had the most... [together] gorgeous blue eyes. Well, I'll be right back. Now, don't either of you go away. Oh, we won't. [shaking maracas] One, two, cha cha cha. One, two, cha cha cha. One, two, cha cha cha. You used to bounce me up and down on your knee before she came. Honey, I promise you, the minute she leaves, I'll bounce you all over the place. Very funny. Do you know you haven't kissed me once today? Well, get ready to chalk one up. Oh, how sweet. I told you you mustn't be bashful in front of me. Go ahead, Wilbur. Kiss her. Thank you, Mr. Post. Aunt Martha, what are you doing with a robe and slippers? Oh, I thought I'd sleep down here on the couch tonight. Don't you like your bedroom? Did Carol make the bed wrong? Oh, no. No. I didn't want to bring it up, but it's that Jasmine bush just outside my window. Oh, I forgot your allergy. Aunt Martha's allergic to Jasmine. I should have remembered. - [no audio] Carol. - No, it doesn't. I'll go get a pillow and some blankets. No, we can't let her sleep down here on the couch. Then where will she sleep? There's no Jasmine bush outside our window. She can sleep in our bedroom. Won't we be a little crowded? Oh, no, I'll sleep in Aunt Martha's room. Now, why didn't I think of that? Now, Carol, Wilbur, I'll be perfectly comfortable down here. Oh, no, I insist, Aunt Martha. It will give us a chance to get better acquainted. Oh. Yes, and then I can show you the family album of pictures of Wilbur when he was a little boy. That's wonderful. I can hardly wait to see his long, golden curls. Oh, you'll just love them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to say goodnight to Tootsie. You've just fulfilled the dream of every American girl... To share her bedroom with her husband's aunt. Honey, it will just be for one night. Uh-uh-uh, let's just be friends... Weebie. One, two, cha cha cha. One, two, cha cha cha... [door slams] Now, sleep well, dear. I love you. I love you. I love you. [makes kissing sound] Oh, you smart little birdie. Goodnight, Tootsie. If you're so smart, say, "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers." Peter, Peter, Peter. Stick them up. It's a holdup. I knew it. You're stupid. I love you. I love you. Smart, huh? Well, I've got a way to fix you, sister. Oh, Wilbur, my favorite Jasmine bush. You want me to put it back? No, no, no. Dig faster. Welcome home, dear. I'll go help Aunt Martha take her clothes back to her own bedroom. Yeah. Good morning, Wilbur. Hi, Roger. Oh, no, no, no, no. You shouldn't have done it. - What? - They're bound to search for her. Oh, cut it out, Roger. Don't worry about me. I won't testify against you. Wilbur! Wilbur! Oh. Tootsie's gone! She's not here! - Tootsie, where are you? - What do you mean she's gone? She's just gone. She's just not here. The last time I saw her she was in her cage right on this stool. Don't get excited. We'll finder her. Let's look outside. You don't think that a cat got her, do you? I couldn't bear it. - It may take time, but I'm sure we'll find her. - I wouldn't sleep at night. I know exactly how you feel. I had two parrots... All right, Ed, What have you done with the parrot? What parrot? Ed, where did you hide that parrot? W-You don't have a search warrant, but come on in and look. Excuse me, Ed. [Mister Ed] Hmm. [Carol] Wilbur! Wilbur! - Yes, Carol? - I just heard about Tootsie. Do you think one of the kids in the neighborhood could have taken her? - Kids? - Come on, honey, help us look. I wonder if bird-napping is a federal rap. Well, I've scoured the neighborhood. No sign of Tootsie. Sure is a mystery. Oh, here's Wilbur. Any luck? Nope. Aunt Martha's just sick about this. You know she went up to her room. Honey, why don't we buy her another parrot? It won't help. Aunt Martha just poured her heart out to me. Do you know she's had Tootsie for 25 years? - That long? - Mm-hmm. Ever since her husband died. That bird's been her closest friend all that time. [Addison] She must be a very lonely person. [Kay] She's always so happy. I think that's a cover-up. You know something else? I don't think she sent us any letter. I was thinking the same thing. She was probably afraid we'd turn her down. - Yeah. - Come on, let's go cheer her up. [weeping] [phone rings] - Hello? - Wilbur, Tootsie's back. That's wonderful! T... Thank you... officer. Tootsie's back. Aunt Martha, Tootsie's back! [Tootsie] I love you. I love you. Stick them up. It's a holdup! Forgive me, Tootsie, for hiding you in that ash can. Tootsie, sweetheart! Yes, baby. Where were you? Yes, darling. Where did you go? I wonder who could have brought her back. Yes, dear. Yes, you're such a sweetie pie, but where were you, darling? Mommy was... Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper. [squawks] Now, who taught her that? Yeah. I wonder who. - Darling! - [everyone chattering] Ed, I just dropped by to tell you Aunt Martha had a wonderful visit. You know, the Addisons really took a liking to her. Well, goodnight, Ed. Sleep well. Where you going? Why? I'm lonely. Talk to me. I've got to get some sleep. Tootsie was never too busy to talk to me. Hmm. You really miss her since Aunt Martha took her home, huh? I can't sleep anymore without noise. Talk to me. Come on, talk to me. [sighs] Okay, Ed. Stick them up. Stick them up. It's a holdup. It's a holdup. Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services, Inc.
