 DETECTIVES' OFFICE DEOKEUN-DONG, GOYANG CITY [deep sigh] -[Jae-suk] That case was… -[Jong-min] Yes. You have to vet a client prior to taking on cases. I know. What Oh Man-seok said at the end really bothered me. -I thought… -[hard thump] I had killed him. Then I guess I'm not guilty of murder. The fact that he knew the law well, and his brazen attitude, it made me feel like the law is powerless,

 -and made me realize that people need us. -[Kwang-soo] Right. -[Jong-min] Yes. -The law is powerless. [Kwang-soo] Remember that chip I brought before? -[Jae-suk] What? -The chip. -The chip? -The potential criminals list. The chip with that list. THE CHIP WITH THE POTENTIAL CRIMINAL LIST Can you unlock this? [keyboard clacking] -[Kwang-soo] Did you get it already? -I did. [Min-young] They analyzed a bunch of people they thought would be dangerous. -The 2020 version requires a password. -[electronic trills] Kim Ki-doo, too. THE PEOPLE ON THE LIST ARE BEING ELIMINATED

 -The list of potential criminals? -[gunshot] [flesh pierces] -[Jong-min] Should we take a look? -We have time, so we can probably solve it. WE SHOULD CRACK THE CODE [suspenseful music] -That's not it. That's the HDMI port. -This isn't it. -Here. -[knocks on door] -[Se-jeong] Oh, my gosh. -[Jae-suk] My goodness. -Is it another package? -Who is it? IS SOMEONE HERE? Another delivery? [door squeaks open] -[door closes] -[Jae-suk] What's this? -What's this? -And you are? A FEMALE STRANGER APPEARS [Jae-suk] What is it? [upbeat music plays] What? Hello. -What is she staring at? Who are you? -Come here. -[hard slap] -[gasps] THAT WAS OUT OF NOWHERE -What… -What's wrong? -[Kwang-soo] My gosh. -Are you the detective? -Yes. -Are you the detective? -Give me my money. -[loud slap] -[all exclaiming] -What's she doing? -Hey, wait. -What the heck? -You took my money, didn't you? -[Kwang-soo] What? -Who took off with my money? -[Jae-suk] Hold on. -Hold on. -What's wrong? -Who took off with my money? -Hold on. Who are you? Who are you? Why are you suddenly slapping him? Who are you? Me? I'm Song Ji-hyo. SONG JI-HYO CLIENT? STRONG FIRST IMPRESSION -Song Ji-hyo? -Yes, Song Ji-hyo. How could you slap him as soon as you walk in like that? Someone asked for advance payment, and they ran off with it. Which one of you was it? -Who? What? -[Jae-suk] Who'd do that? -Who was it? -Who did that? -You? -It wasn't us. I wanted you to check up on my cheating boyfriend. I was embarrassed, so I hired you online. -But you took my money and disappeared. -You walk in here-- We don't do anything online! -Seung-gi, was it you? -No, I don't do anything online. -[Jae-suk] Who are you? -[Ji-hyo] Give me my money back. -But… -[Se-jeong] Why don't you have a seat? -Hey. -Stop that. -Let go of me! -Hey. -Hold on. Wait. -[bottle clinks] -Calm down. -Why you… -Stop it. -Oh, my gosh. -Wait. Stop. -Stop it. -Okay. Come on. -Hold on. We just met! -[Seung-gi] Sit down. -Let's talk. -You shouldn't do that. -But-- -[Se-jeong] Have a seat. -You seem very upset. Please sit. There must be a misunderstanding. Your face is all red. Of course, it is. She hit me so hard. -[Jong-min] I'm so scared. -[Jae-suk] You seem very angry. [Sehun] That was scary. Find the bastard who took off with my money. If you don't find that fraud, I'll teach you how terrible fraud is, got it? [Ji-hyo] If you don't find the bastard, I'll have you all locked up. I'm going to the police right now. -Got that? -Wait, but we're not-- -What was the email address? -What the heck? [all exclaiming in disbelief] -What was that? -What just happened? Think long and hard. Did you do something bad? -Maybe when you were drunk? -No, nothing. -She was out to get you though. -She's a nutjob. -Is she an ex or something? -What do you mean? She's totally not my type. [laughter] I've never seen her before. Me? I'm Song Ji-hyo. Who was she? Se-jeong, do you know her? Did you accept her case online? No, I didn't. -Check our email. -Us? -We have one? -What's an email? -Wait. I just got a text. -What? What does it say? "Why aren't you here yet? I see that you've read my email. Please come quickly, or I will retract my offer to hire you." -[Sehun] Why did that go to you? -[Kwang-soo] Right? -Was it you? -Who was it? -Min-young. Your earrings. -It wasn't me. -Your earrings. -[Jong-min] Min-young. Like this is that much money. But seriously, who was it? Anyway, if they sent this text, -it means… -They know our number. -That means there's a fake website. -Right. -Someone's impersonating us. -Right. You're right. That's possible. If someone is impersonating us, we need to catch them. If they took payment using my number… -[Kwang-soo] They must be imposters. -Let's go. [Jae-suk] What a hectic morning. [Min-young] Let's go. And we're off. [theme music] [Jae-suk] This must be the place. Let's go inside. -[Seung-gi] Why would they impersonate us? -[Jae-suk] It's very fancy. How may I help you? -We were told we had an appointment. -We received a text. -We're private detectives. -Private detectives? Yes. -The detectives are already here. -What? -What the heck? -A team of detectives came? -They really are imposters. -Really? [thrilling music] [woman 1] Please come in, then. Who's impersonating us? [Jong-min] We should duke it out. -What is this? -[Sehun] We should teach them a lesson. -What's going on? -They're the detectives? -I'm speechless. -[Jae-suk] Who are these people? [scoffs] -What the heck? -What the heck? -It's so obvious… -Are you kidding me? [Se-jeong] Is that me? -What is this? -What is that? Why are you being so rude? What's with that hat? We heard that there were people impersonating us. It looks like all they did was match the number. -I'm not sure about this. -This is insane. I'm flabbergasted. They copied us exactly. [Jae-suk] Hold on. This guy… So this guy… Are you a detective? -Do you know me? -What? Do you know me? Regardless of whether or not I know you, you look familiar. You're so rude. -Please calm down. -Everyone, calm down. -You haven't met before. -What is this? -Hey. Sorry. Sorry about that. -Who are you? -[Kwang-soo] Sorry. -[Jae-suk] Why are you here? -We're a little upset. -Look at that hat. -Who are you, Mr. Mustache? -Please calm down. -Why are you impersonating us? -Mr. Jo. Put your hat back on. -You're detectives? -[Se-ho] Look. -[Byung-jae] Please sit. -[Se-ho] We were going to be nice, -but you're being very rude. -Are you a baker? -A baker? -What the heck? The clothes are the same. [clapping] I was going to wear that hat today. Are you my knock-off? -What? A knock-off? -She's my knock-off? At least copy my hair color, too. Gosh. You must be my knock-off. It's you. What is this? RAVI -Is that you in black? -That's me. [Jae-suk] Hold on. Those are my clothes. -What are you talking about? -Look at him! [Kwang-soo] What is that? Why am I like that? -So it's you. It's you. -[laughter] The punk impersonating me. -Why does he sound… -Nice. Why does he sound so awkward? -[Se-ho] Nice. -I hear you're impersonating me and call yourself "Kwang-soo." Kwang-Kwang. They're both Kwangs. -That's right. -Kwang-hee. -He copied your name. -He lost weight to look like you. Hold on. You hired us, right? -Yes, but-- -To be more precise, she's our client. -Your client? -And stop hitting me. Do you know me? Do you? -[Jae-suk] What? -Do you know me? -I don't, but I do. -What does that mean? I do, but don't. And I don't, but I do. Okay, let's figure this out. [Kwang-hee] Please have a seat. We have a lot to say as well. -The real ones have to be patient. -Right. -Okay, sounds good. -Let's sit. -Let's sit. -I don't get what's going on. You're both detectives, correct? -Yes, we are. -[Se-jeong] Yes. -[Jae-suk] We're the-- -No. We're the real ones. I only hired one team. -[Jae-suk] Really? -Which of you are the real detectives? Are you detectives? -Or are you fakes impersonating us? -We're detectives. -Are you knock-offs? -No. [Byung-jae] We heard there was a team impersonating us. To be honest, I'm disappointed. It's far below my expectations. -Se-jeong. She says you're below. -[laughs] [Ravi] To think someone like this copied me… -Hey. You. -I'm disappointed. [Seung-gi] But… Hold on. To be honest, you're better. Do you want to join us? -You should go. It's time for you to leave -[clapping] Anyway, if you're the real ones, -why did you use my phone number -Exactly. to get clients? That's the first I've heard. We got a text-- -You rude bastard! - [slap] Hey! Calm down! What's wrong with you people? -Hey. -What's wrong with you today? -Min-young, are you okay? -Sorry about that. -Calm down! -[Min-young] I'm fine. I know you're always excited, but… Hold on. Sorry. I know we just met, but we're very sensitive right now after hearing that people were impersonating us. -What's that? -[clacks] I don't care which of you are the real detectives. -I'm okay as long as you solve my case. -[all shouting] A VERY LARGE FEE -[Kwang-soo] Ma'am! -Hold on. Our deepest apologies for our rudeness -once again. -Okay. That's more like it. [woman 1] As you can see, it's a lot. Yes, it is. I will pay this fee only to the team of detectives who solves my case today. [Jae-suk] That goes without saying. So, the case that I want to hire you for is this. I haven't been able to sleep lately because things are just too hard for me. First, the case is… [eerie music] What? What's wrong? [eerie whispers] What's wrong? What's going on? -What's wrong with her? -What's going on? -What's wrong? -Are you guys detectives? -What's this? -[maniacal laughter] How is it that every single one of you doesn't look trustworthy at all? Why do you look like that? How could not a single one of you look trustworthy? I'm scared. -She's possessed. -That's what it is. She's possessed. -I'm dead right now. -What? -I'm a ghost! -[Se-ho] She died? Please find my boyfriend. -[Jong-min] What? -[gasps] -I just got chills. -[ghost] I was killed right before my boyfriend proposed to me, before our wedding. [Kwang-soo] Before he proposed? THE CLIENT POSSESSED SOMEONE I want to know just how sad he is. I can't leave this world until I do. -You're detectives, right? -[Jong-min] Yes. -[ghost] Can you find my boyfriend? -Yes, definitely. -[maniacal laughter] -Why is she laughing? All I remember is my boyfriend's name… -[Jae-suk] What is his name? -Yoo. -Yoo. -Tae! -Tae. -Uk! -Yoo Tae-uk? -Yoo Tae-uk! -Yoo Tae-uk? -My boyfriend -is a hopeless romantic for me. -Romantic. And a proposal I can never forget. I want to see my boyfriend so badly. Where is he now? -We have to figure that out. -We have to find him. But you're a detective! Can't you find one person? I'm sorry. -Why is he pissing everyone off today? -[laughs] You can find my boyfriend, can't you? [laughter] -You'll find him, right? -Yes. -You must find him! -Don't worry. Find him! -Oh, my gosh. -Do you remember anything else? -All we have are his name and age. -Are you okay? -She's back. -Are you okay? First of all, the spirit you just met is the client. I see. The ghost is the client. It's the first time we were hired by a ghost. Do you know the client's name? -Her name is Kim Seo-ri. -[Jong-min] Seo-ri. She is 35 years old, the same as Yoo Tae-uk. They're the same age. She died, right? She says she won't leave until she sees her boyfriend. -[Se-ho] She won't leave? -It must be a grudge. But are we supposed to find him without any clues? First, she said he was supposed to propose at his place of work. -[Jong-min] At his work. -His place of work. -[woman 1] Yes. -It'll be hard to find him with just this. [bag zips] -Do you have something? -Clues? These are the love letters that they had exchanged. We'll take this. -Wait. -Jae-suk! -Sit down. -Let go. -Sit down. -Let go. These are the love letters the two of them exchanged? [woman 1] Yes. All the clues should be in here. Then we'll take this. Hold on. We're the ones who were hired. -We were hired. -So were we. Regardless, since there are two teams of detectives, -Actually, I've… -[all exclaiming] -So we wouldn't fight. -You're very wise. -Please find him. -[Jae-suk] All right. Whoever finds him first, please call me. -Okay. -Definitely. -We'll call you right away. -Don't worry. KIM SEO-RI, YOO TAE-UK PLANNED TO PROPOSE WHAT CLUES ARE IN THE LOVE LETTERS? EPISODE 7: THE GHOST CLIENT; THE CASE OF THE IMPOSTER DETECTIVES [Min-young] Okay, then. These are love letters. First, here. "I've lost my way in your heart. There is no end. This is a maze without an exit." Let's look at the big picture. We have to find Yoo Tae-uk. He made preparations to propose to her, but she died before he could. These love letters were probably a part of the process for planning the proposal. In light of that… -Each of the words are colored. -[Jong-min] That's right. I think that's meaningful. Maybe we can read them by the colors. -[Min-young] Right? -Yes. For example, if that's the rainbow, red would be one, orange would be two. [Byung-jae] It may indicate numbers. These are definitely the clues to finding that man. What can we glean from this? I'VE LOST MY WAY IN YOUR HEART SHOW ME YOUR HEART THE FIRST SONG I WROTE FOR YOU OUR LOVE I WANT TO HIKE YOU A TRIP ALONE I WANT TO HIKE YOU A TRIP ALONE [Byung-jae] This maze doesn't have just one answer. They go in several directions. So I don't think this is a word. Maybe this isn't a hint. [thrilling music] "The first song I wrote for you." Maybe this has an address or something. -[Jong-min] I think it's an address. -Or maybe we can combine the words of the same color to find the address. I think it's an address. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Seven. [Sehun] Six. Maybe this is a keyboard again. -[Se-jeong] It may be. -A keyboard. It's the same. Every page has the same layout of letters. I'VE LOST MY WAY SHOW ME YOUR HEART THE FIRST SONG I WROTE FOR YOU OUR LOVE WILL END THE DAY YOU FIND THE END OF THE TANGLED THREAD He's right. He's right. It's a keyboard. It's the same. [Sehun] There must be something behind the colors. -This is so hard. -Maybe there are two places. Yellow is the address for yellow. Pink is the address for pink. -That's right. -I think you're right. -Right? -Yes. [funky music] -What do I do? -The color of the frame -is that color. -You're right. -[Se-jeong] What? -[Jong-min] The frame and this. The fifth is "sa", "su"… "Seo." It's "seo." That says "seo." -This must be it. -[beeping sound] "Pae." "Seopae." It's an address though. Seopae. [Seung-gi] There's a Seopae-dong. It exists. There's a Seopae-dong in Paju in Gyeonggi-do. -Seopae-dong? -Yes, this is Seopae. Maybe if we add the dots page, we'll get the address. The same goes for the yellow. I think we have to combine them. Then we may get the full address. SEOPAE +? SECOND LOCATION Hey. We have to find "our end." Maybe like a restaurant? Our end. A restaurant? Are you hungry? No. It says to find "our end." [pen squeaking] [Byung-jae] I think the colors are letters. -The colors are letters? -That's my gut feeling. There are 26 in total. I put them together, and I found a shape. Like this. It looks like a keyboard. So it may be a keyboard? That's right. [thrilling music] -[Bo-hyun] I got it. Got it. -What is it? The frames' colors are different. -This is yellow. -Yes, yellow. -These letters are the hint. -[beeping sound] [gasps] [Se-ho] You're right. It's E, D, H. -Dong? -Yes. [Bo-hyun] One, two, three, four, five. -[Se-ho] The letter "S." -[Bo-hyun] S. That makes "san." "Dongsan." DONG + SAN DONGSAN + ? What are these dots? "I want to hike you, break through six obstacles and fall weightlessly." -[Kwang-soo] It's here, too. -It shows up again. Yes. This is harder than I expected. [pensive music] I WANT TO HIKE YOU A TRIP ALONE, JUST US, -I think I got it. -What? Did you figure it out? It's braille. Braille? -[Se-jeong] Right? -[Kwang-soo] Really? This? -[Jong-min] That's it! -Really? This has English and everything. [Jae-suk] You're right. It's here. I WANT TO HIKE YOU [suspenseful music] WITH NOTHING BUT LOVE [beeping] -So that gives us the full address. -[Se-jeong] Right. And this is a number. -Because if you look… -How did you figure that out? You know how elevator buttons have braille on them. By now, we should… You know. You're really good. SEOPAE +? DONGSAN + ? SEOPAE-DONG 471-3 DONGSAN-DONG 370-4F Let's split up by the cars we came in. -Let's split. -You go first. -I'll get the car. Come out. -Get the car. Why did those people come today? [Bo-hyun] This is hard. Let's solve this first. -[Jae-suk] Jong-min! Get in! -[Jong-min] What? -We're going to Dongsan-dong, right? -[Kwang-soo] Yes. -We're going to Seopae-dong, right? -[Se-jeong] Yes, Seopae-dong. -[Seung-gi] Okay. -Parking fee. You can pay through the navigation system. -[Ming-young] Really? You can? -You can pay through that? -[Seung-gi] That's right. -Oh, my gosh. [Jae-suk] Things like this put us ahead of those imposters. We were so cool today. It feels great. We socked it to them. -[Se-jeong] That's so cool. -It really is. [female robotic voice] Let's go. [Se-jeong] We totally won. They don't compare. After competing against those geniuses, civilians like them… -"Civilians"? -[laughter] -Civilians are… -They're cute, that's what. They were so funny from the get-go. I burst out laughing when I saw them. THE COMPETITION DOESN'T MAKE THEM NERVOUS AT ALL -I don't think they'll ever leave there. -No way. Right? [Bo-hyun] I think it's braille. [yawning] -They left. Hey, they left. -Where did they go? DID THEY LEAVE ALREADY? They left? We just have to figure out the braille. 471-3, SEOPAE-DONG SEUNG-GI, MIN-YOUNG, SE-JEONG DONGSAN-DONG 370-4F JAE-SUK, JONG-MIN, KWANG-SOO, SEHUN DONGSAN-DONG, GOYANG CITY -[Sehun] I think this is it. -We're here. -[Jae-suk] What's this? -[Kwang-soo] This. -It was in the drawing. -[Kwang-soo] That was this. -"I want to hike you." -[Jong-min] The hiking one. -This? The hiking one. -Yes. -[Sehun] This is it. -[Jong-min] This place has that… -[man 1] Hello. -Hello. -[man 1] Are you here to work out? -So… Is it your first time? -[Kwang-soo] Yes, it's our first time. -We're here to look for something. -What was his name? -[Jae-suk] Do you know Yoo Tae-uk? Yoo Tae-uk? Yes, I do. -Where is he? -[man 1] He's a regular. -I see. -What about now? Is there a way to find him? Can you give us some information? We must find him. There's a woman that he met here. That's right. -Was her name Seo-ri? -Yes, that's right. This is the place. [man 1] I remember he was getting ready to marry her. That's right. I don't know the details, but there's a favorite course that couples take. [man 1] He was going to propose there, but it's still there. ARE THERE CLUES ABOUT THE BOYFRIEND HERE? Okay, we'll take a look. Thanks. You have to go that way. -Thank you. -Thank you. So he doesn't come anymore. -This place has everything. -It's amazing. [Sehun] So you can play sports, eat, -and sleep here. -You can do anything. [Jae-suk]They have basketball, an arcade… This place is awesome. -Jae-suk, what's first? -[Jae-suk] Parabolic slide? THERE ARE 3 COUPLES' ACTIVITIES TO INVESTIGATE [Sehun] Is this it? This is it, right? -[Jong-min] It's a climbing wall. -It's wall climbing. [Jae-suk] He said they went on dates here often. Maybe there's something written there. -[Jong-min] There's something way on top. -Do we have to climb this? [Kwang-soo] He was going to propose here. What did he plan? -There's something there. -[Jong-min] Right? [Jae-suk] He must have left messages up there. We have to climb up. -Sehun and-- -And Kwang-soo. Go up. [overlapping laughs] -I'll go quickly. -[Jong-min] Okay. -Okay. -You'll do it all? Okay. -If you'll do it, I'm out. -[Jae-suk] Okay. [Sehun] Sure. I'll go and read them. Let me know if you get tired. I'll do the rest. -[Sehun] I'll be back soon. -Okay. -Turn around if you think you'll fall. -Let me know if you get tired. [Kwang-soo] Don't be nervous. -Relax. -Move your legs with your arms. [Sehun] It's actually… You can't climb with your arms. [determined music] [grunt] -It's scary. -You're there. Read it. "Number friends from six families are racing." "Number friends from six families are racing." [Jae-suk] There's one to your left. [Sehun] "Number three has a twin older brother." [Jae-suk] Sehun. You're not afraid of heights. "Number one was in first place…" "Number one." CLUES OBTAINED "Number one was in first place…" -"Number one." -Sorry, Sehun, but can you come down and get your phone and take pictures? That sounds good. -And climb with one hand? -You're angry, right? [Sehun] No. I'm just unstable. -[Jong-min] Are you scared? -I'm scared now. No, you're not scared. Go higher. You'll be less scared. You're confused. You're just confused. No, you're not scared. I'm so scared now. I'm scared now. You're not scared. You're confused and think you're scared. [Sehun] I'm scared. -I'm scared. -Okay, come down. Come down. Kwang-soo, you go up. -[laughs] -You're tall, so that's nothing. -[Kwang-soo] But… -You're tall. And Sehun is tired. [Jae-suk] There's a mantis on the wall. -[Sehun] A mantis. -What do I step on? -[Jong-min] Step on them all. -He looks like a pond skater. [Jong-min] The more time you waste there… Why do his legs look even skinnier today? [Jae-suk] Kwang-soo, go up. You'll get tired. -[Jong-min] Just go right up. -You have to go up. -You have to keep moving one by one. -Hurry up. One! Two! -One! Two! -One two what? Why is it so high? Keep with our beat. [clapping hands] -[Jong-min] Don't look down! -[Sehun] One! Two! POND SKATER GETTING INTO THE BEAT -One! Two! -One! Two! -One! Two! -Look at him go! -One! Two! -[laughter] -One! Two! -One! Two!

"Number seven overtook the older twin brother who was in second place." And further up. One! Two! THE SUPPORTIVE CHEER MAKES THE POND SKATER DANCE -One! Two! -[Jong-min] My gosh. What is it? "Number five is second from behind." Come down quickly. We'll go to the next one. Grab the rope and push off the wall. -[Kwang-soo] Can't I climb down? -[Jae-suk] Come down! -Come down. Jump. -Grab the rope. My hands feel weak. -I can't grab it. -[Jae-suk] Come down. It will hold you better than you think. -I was also-- -Kwang-soo! [Sehun] I know how you feel, but you have to trust it. -We'll go ahead. -I'm going down! It'll support you. It will. [chuckles] -Support what? -The rope will support your butt. -No, it doesn't! -[Jae-suk] Come down! -[Sehun] It'll support you. -Come down already. You have to let go. -We'll leave if you don't come down. -Let go. -I can't-- -Let go. Seriously, man. -I can't let go! -[Sehun] It's really scary. So jump! -[Se-ho] This must be it. -[Jae-suk] You have to let go. -[Se-ho] I hear something. -[Ravi] Let's go see. -[Jae-suk] They're here. -They are here. [Kwang-hee] Our knock-offs are here. Why is there a mannequin up there? [Jae-suk] Hurry up and get down. We don't have time for this. They didn't even pass stage one. [Bo-hyun] Let's do stage one first and come back. -We'll finish in no time. -[Jae-suk] Kwang-soo! Come down. Come to the next one. [Kwang-hee] We'll go first. No. I'm coming.

[Jong-min] This is the slide. What is that? What do we do here? Ravi, the knock-offs are watching, so do it right. Let's go, Ravi. You can do it. [Ravi] I feel like a cooking ingredient. You must fall from up there. [woman 2] Hold on tight. We'll pull you right up. -[Bo-hyun] Let's go, Ravi! -[Se-ho] All right! This looks scary. You have to drop. [woman 2] Okay, we'll pull you up.

Hold on! I can't do this! I can't! What's up there? Where's the hint? Can you go a little higher? A little higher? It's so scary! [funky music] NUMBER 7 IN 5TH PLACE He went all the way up. Are you good? Hold on. Wait. Not yet. -[Bo-hyun] Wait. Is there… -I think there's something there. NUMBER 3 NUMBER 4 -What's there? -[Kwang-hee] Hold on, Ravi! -Hold on tight. -No, you can't look from there. -There must be something up there. -Maybe in that box. THAN 7 RUNNING [Kwang-hee] Isn't he up there for too long? [Bo-hyun] We'll write it down when you come down. Just remember it. -[Kwang-hee] He has strong arms. -Stay for as long as you can. -He's hanging on for a while. -I know. He's good. Did he faint up there? -My arms feel weak now! -Ravi, you're there for too long. I want to go down. I can't go down. -How do I go down? -[Kwang-hee] Hang on. -[screams] -[exclaims] [balls rattle] -Good work. You did great, Ravi. -[laughs] [Jae-suk] Let's go to the next one. Hurry. [Ravi] There are two blocks up there. "Number three is running in front of seven." Something like that. "Four is this from the front or back." -I have to look again. -[Se-ho] Really? Let's look again. -[Jae-suk] Let's go for now. -[Sehun] What is it? -What is this? -Maybe you have to walk across stuff -hanging by ropes? -[Jae-suk] That must be it. -Like that? -[Kwang-soo] That looks tough. That too… THE CLUES ARE HIGH UP [tense music] So this is what the six obstacles and the falling thing was referring to. [Jong-min] Oh, my gosh. This is the highlight. That's too scary for me. [Seung-gi] We have so much time. -Melody Art Academy. -You're right. -It's definitely a composer. -The piano. [Seung-gi] Hello. [woman 3] How may I help you? -We're private detectives. -[woman 3] Okay. We found a book of love letters from Yoo Tae-uk that he prepared for his proposal. That's why we came here. -Love letters? -[Seung-gi] Yes. THE FIRST SONG I WROTE FOR YOU -Tae-uk was such a big romantic. -[Seung-gi] Okay. So he used to do a lot of special things for his girlfriend here. I remember him working on something at that piano -and that music stand. -[Seung-gi] Okay. Also, he gifted those tutus for the ballerinas. -The tutus? -Yes. -There's something written-- -[Min-young] There's writing. Piano, music stand, tutus. There must be clues in each one. -[Sungwoon] I think-- -[Seunghee] Wait. Hold on. They're here already. -They're here. -They're coming. [overlapping voices] -What took you so long? -You must have received a lot of help. -You must not have had time to eat. -[Byung-jae] So you ate. -[Seung-gi] You must be hungry. -Yes, we are. -You must be starving. -[Byung-jae] We have to read this, too. -I want to read the piano first. -You must be starving. FIND ME This must be the notes. Do, re, mi, fa. [Byung-jae] Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti. There are seven. [sharp inhale] [funky music] FIND ME [smacking lips] I don't think they found anything yet. [hums in wonder] Do… Seunghee. Can you play anything on the piano? [piano playing] Oh, my gosh. SEUNGHEE CAN PLAY THE PIANO -Like this. -We've discovered a new talent. I'll give you a hint since you played the piano so well. -Seung-gi. What are you doing? -I'll give you a hint. -You don't want it? -Let's just take it. -But… -Hey. Mr. Ha. -You looked like you wanted it. -No, I don't. -We can swap. -I'll tell you if you say, "Please share." -Please share. -Hold on. -Please share. -Say it louder. [clock ticking] [Seunghee] Do, do, do, do. The red is do. [Seung-gi] Say it louder. -Hold on. What is that? -No. [Seunghee] It's do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do. [Byung-jae] Okay! A FAMILIAR TUNE -You were too obvious. -[clapping hands] Play something else. ACTUALLY, WE FIGURED IT OUT ALREADY -It is. -It is? -Yes. -Awesome. Yes. The colors of the rainbow were the order of the notes. This is the "Wedding March." [piano playing] He was proposing, so the "Wedding March" is right. Right. The "Wedding March." [mysterious music] [Min-young] There's something on the piano. "Find me, star." FIND ME…? IS THE SHEET MUSIC FOR "WEDDING MARCH" HERE? WEDDING MARCH WEDDING MARCH There must be something about 206. [Seung-gi] Close it for now. [books clacking] It's too hard. [Seung-gi] They don't know yet. We found the sheet music. [woman 3] Girls, come out. Take your positions. Careful. He gifted those tutus. YOO TAE-UK GIFTED THE TUTUS We have to watch this carefully. [woman 3] Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, -five, six, -We have to watch from here, right? seven, eight. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. -Is it F, O, T, E? -[woman 3] Seven. One, two, three, four, -five, six… -Can't you spin a little slower? -Can't you spin a little slower? -…seven, eight. -[giggles] -One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. [Se-jeong] What does it say? [woman 3] Good job, girls. Let's go back in. Excuse me. [woman 3] Next team, get ready. -[Seung-gi] Hold on. -I couldn't see anything. "F, O, T, T, E." [Byung-jae] What do I need to look for? WHAT DO THE LETTERS ON THE TUTUS MEAN? [suspenseful music] [Min-young] I think the tutus are clocks. -[Seung-gi] What do you mean? -I think it's this. -Like this. -[low-pitched beep] [Seung-gi] So they were one, two, three, four, five. -Awesome. -I think they're clocks. THE BALLERINAS TURN CLOCKWISE THE TUTUS REPRESENT CLOCKS OR TIME? [Min-young] So, the letters on the tutus are the first letters of the hours on the clock. There are hearts in between like this. [whooshing] If we figure out the hearts… MIN-YOUNG'S NOTES I think there was a heart opposite one o'clock. The opposite of one is seven. It's seven. [beep] Isn't this nine? -[Min-young] The heart is between E and E. -[beep] Between eight o'clock and eleven o'clock. It's nine. -T is twelve o'clock. -[beep] The heart was opposite that, so it's six o'clock. [Seung-gi] The last one is three. Since it was right next to F. [Min-young] The clue hidden in the tutus is 7936. I think we have to solve the sheet music. Once we solve the sheet music, that's all three. SPORTS CENTER, DONGSAN-DONG [Kwang-soo] Jong-min, we don't have time. [Jae-suk] Come on, Jong-min. -This is the scariest. -Here I go! [Kwang-soo] You have to move quickly. [tense music] The moment you think you're scared, you'll really be scared. What? Hold on! I'm wearing dress shoes. -[Jae-suk] So am I. -It's slippery. -[laughs] -What does it matter? Jong-min. Please. [Jong-min] It's dangerous. It's dangerous. My legs are shaking. -Okay. -That looks so scary. -[Jae-suk] Gosh, darn it. -[Jong-min] It's so shaky! -[Sehun] That looks insanely scary. -Darn it. I can't stand to even look. Don't you see any writing? It's too scary! [Kwang-soo] There's something below you. Hey! It's by my feet. -You have to look at it. -Hey. -I can't look down. I can't see. -There's no point if you walk past it! I can't look down! [Jong-in] How can I look down? You have to look down as you go. -[Sehun] What is it? -You have to look down for clues! I can't see. -"Number two -Number two. is running fourth from the back." NUMBER 2 IS RUNNING 4TH FROM THE BACK [Jae-suk] Jong-min, you can do it. -[Jong-min] There's another one! -What does it say? "There are nine in the race." -[Jae-suk] "There are nine in the race." -Nine. I guess it'll be who came in first. You did great, Jong-min. You can do it! [Jong-min] I don't think I can do this one! -[Jae-suk] What? -I can't do this one. Yes, you can! There's only one bridge. [ominous music] So go. [chuckles] It's a narrow beam. -Just go. -Since it's narrow, step one foot in front of the other. [Jong-min] That's not it. Oh, my gosh! The plank is shaking! That's your lot in life. [Jong-min] Oh, my gosh! Jae-suk! -This is insane. -[Sehun] You're so cool. [Jong-min] This is insane. THE IDIOT DETECTIVE BECAME TALKATIVE Jong-min! You have to look down to see if there's anything there. -Shoot. -[Kwang-soo] There's something down there. [Jae-suk] I can't do it. I can't even watch. It's too hard just looking down. -Shoot! -There's something by your foot! I can't look down! Oh, my gosh! Where is it? There. What is that? [Jong-min] I can't. I couldn't read it! I can't do it. -Look down! You have to look down! -What does it say? -Let's hurry. -Is that it? Where do we go? -That way. -We have to go up. They're coming. If you don't read it, it defeats the purpose of going there! [Jong-min] Whatever. Hey. -Jong-min, what does it say? -You can't just go! "The two seven brothers are in the lead and have a dot between them." That was insane. Jae-suk, can you switch with me? Just go for now. Go. [Bo-hyun] Run. Come on, run. -He's here. -[Jae-suk] He's here. [Jong-min] This is insane. We should do that while Jong-min finishes. "Number four is ahead of number five." [Jong-min] "Number four is ahead of number five." [Bo-hyun] It's best to just go quickly. [Kwang-soo] They overtook us. -"Between three and two…" -We have to write it down. -[Jong-min] Okay. -[Ravi] Okay, nice. -Oh, my gosh. -[Kwang-hee] Ravi! -[Sehun] Jong-min, you solved this one. -Really? [Sehun] We couldn't have done it without you. For real. I'm so scared. -[Bo-hyun] I'll do it, then. -Okay, go. [Bo-hyun] Hold on. Hold on. [thrilling music] You got this, right? "Number two is running fourth from the back." [Se-ho] Okay. Hey. Are you okay? "There are nine in the race." Bo-hyun, that's impressive in shoes. "Number four is in fifth place." -[Bo-hyun] Relay what I say. -I'll write it down, so read it out loud. BO-HYUN LOOKS MORE COMFORTABLE HERE THAN ON LAND "The two seven brothers are in the lead and have a dot between them." Hurry! I think they're done! -[Sehun] How do you let go from there? -I'm so scared. Can you let me down? I'm scared. I'm so scared. You'll let go naturally once your arms get weak. [all exclaiming] [panicked sighs] -Jae-suk. -That was so scary. I'll read them to you. "Number seven lost the lead to three." It lost the reed! -"Lead." -It lost the lead. [thrilling music] [Kwang-hee] What's this? This one is hard. Bo-hyun! What does it say? "Number four is ahead of number five." "Number four is running between three and two." -[Ravi] Let's go down. -[ruffles] WHAT DO YOU GET IF YOU COMBINE THEM ALL? [Jae-suk] Let's solve it now. There was that hint. -Which one? -There were nine in the race. [Jae-suk] "Number friends from six families are racing." There are six families, -so there are only six numbers. -Right. One, two, three, four, five, seven. Those are the only numbers. -We have to-- -From the start. Let's do the race from the start. Four is in the middle. Right. Four is fifth from the front and the back. -Seven lost the lead to three. -[beep] So three is in first. One of the threes is in first. Then seven is in second and third. -Someone else is in first. -Seven is in second and third. -[Jae-suk] And… -Number three runs in front of seven as well as behind it. Five is second from the back. -Five is second from the back. -Second. We have to look relative to five. Number one was in the lead, then fell behind five, and there's only one spot after five. -So number one is last. -That's one. After four is two. It says four is between three and two. The two seven brothers are in the lead and have a dot between them. A dot? So it's 37.7342751. -It's 37.7342… -…751. NUMBER 7 LOST THE LEAD TO 3 What is that? Is it a phone number? What's with that period? WHAT DOES THIS NUMBER REPRESENT? [Jae-suk] Is it around here? What does this have to do with a proposal? She died. His workplace. [Jae-suk] Se-jeong texted. -Yes. -They got a number, too. They got 126.7936206. It's similar to ours. -It's not a multiple or anything. -[phone ringing] -Hi, Seung-gi. -You got a number, right? That's what you found, right? -Yes. -We got "126.7936206." Sit down. [Min-young] I'll explain. HDS is a hint. They have to be changed into the alphabet. So, this is this. They're 4, 8, 16, 32. And you identify the letter of the alphabet using the staff. Since this is an eighth note, -It would be the eighth note, fifth letter -[beeping] O. You're right. It would be the eighth note, fourth letter. -[Sungwoon] One. -[Byung-jae] One. -This means… It says 126. -[beeping] -[Byung-jae] It's 126. -Yes. [Min-young] But there's a dot at the end. If we add what we found at the piano, 206, -and 7936 from the ballerinas… -[beeping] …we get 126.7936206. So this is a coordinate. -Latitude, longitude. -Latitude, longitude? -I see. 793… -They should've just said so. Seriously. Gosh. [Kwang-soo] So ours is the latitude and theirs is the longitude. Okay, 37… Got it. [Se-jeong] "206, Tapsakgol-gil, Jori-eup in Paju." -First Garden? It's a garden. -Okay, let's go. [Seung-gi] Why did he make his proposal so difficult? -Did you think… -Yes? …that maybe by some chance, we may lose? -No way. -No. They're not like the genius detectives. To be honest, I want to take a nap. I bet that's how the genius detectives felt when they competed against us. -Exactly. -But we won. Right. That's why we can end up losing, too. DON'T GET COCKY, BUT THEY ARE EASY I want to cry. [laughter] Got it. The latitude starts with 37. -And the longitude is about 127. -[Se-ho] Right. We just have to go there. -Byung-jae. -Yes? Bo-hyun just texted you. First Garden. Type it in and come there. That's the place. Okay. So we didn't do anything on our own. -[laughter] -[Byung-jae] Let's hurry. This really hurts my pride. I feel like we were patronized. Once we find Yoo Tae-uk, we're done, right? We must show them what professional detectives are like. -[Kwang-hee] We must nip it in the bud. -Exactly. WHICH TEAM WILL GET THERE FIRST? FIRST GARDEN, PAJU -[Se-jeong] Let's go and solve this. -[Seung-gi] Let's go. -[Min-young] There's a ticket booth. -[Seung-gi] We need to get tickets. As we predicted, they're not here yet. I think we're the first to arrive. -[Seung-gi] Hello. -Hello. [Seung-gi] We're private detectives. We need to investigate something. Is there someone here… What is his name again? -[Min-young] Woo Tae-uk? -Yoo Tae-uk. Yoo Tae-uk? We use aliases here. THE EMPLOYEES USE ALIASES So I don't know who Yoo Tae-uk is. [gasps] -I have a list of employees here. -[Seung-gi] Okay. Do you want to look? Here's the list. [Seung-gi] Employee list? -What is that? -[Seung-gi] "Shootdol, Ojakgyo, Love Call Center…" -Hey. Horn-rimmed glasses. -The glasses. Tae-uk has a mole above his lip on the right. And he wears thick horn-rimmed glasses. EMPLOYEE LIST [Seung-gi] Horn-rimmed glasses, left part, -and mole. There. -The mole. -[Se-jeong] Shy Guy has a mole. -It's Shy Guy. -Shy Guy. -Shy Guy? -Hold on. -It's similar to my drawing. A scar by his left eyebrow, left part, a mole above his lip on the right, and thick horn-rimmed glasses. Shy Guy is supposed to check the proposal course today. Today? Is he coming here today, then? Yes. There are nine proposal courses. He should be at one of them. SHE SAYS YOO TAE-UK IS AT ONE OF THE NINE LOCATIONS If he isn't at any of them, that means he's at the final proposal spot. -Thank you. -Thank you. [Seung-gi] Thank you. If he isn't at any of them, he'll be at the last one, so we have to find him before then. Se-jeong and I will go to the amusement park. -I'll go to the wedding hall. -[Seung-gi] Okay. Let's split up and find him. Shy Guy. Okay. Shy guy. Should we split up in pairs? -Since we don't have mics. I mean… -Okay. [Jae-suk] We'll go to the greenhouse. Hey, here's number six. Amusement park. -We'll go here! -[Jae-suk] Come here. -We're going to number six! -Number six? Yes. [Se-ho] Thank you. So Yoo Tae-uk is Shy Guy. [Ravi] Are we the first ones here? -Should we split up? -Shall we? -Then… -[Ravi] Okay. Where are we right now? "The ticket booth." Where are we? I'll go to the gift shop first since it's the closest. -Okay. We'll split up the rest. -[Sungwoon] Okay. -[Se-jeong] Shy Boy, was it? -[Seung-gi] Shy Guy. He went to check the proposal courses. Isn't this love lock the thing that couples do? "I will be your prince on a white horse." "I will be your prince on a white horse." -Tae-uk and Seo-ri. Here. -[Seung-gi] Where? Tae-uk and Seo-ri. This is it. But what could the code be? [Seung-gi] "I will be your prince on a white horse." Your prince… [Sungwoon] Hello. I think he came by the gift shop. What is that? "Let's put teddy bears next to our future family portrait." -Oh… -[bells ringing] "Remembering the kisses with you which were as sweet as candy." Found it. Hey. There's a key. THERE'S A LOCK WITH YOO TAE-UK AND KIM SEO-RI'S NAMES ON IT FOR COUPLES: ROMANTIC PROPOSAL COURSE [Seung-gi] White horse. Hold on. "Your prince on a white…" Can we ride this white horse? [Jae-suk] There's Seung-gi. Hold on. There's something here. What is it? What could it be? -Did you find a clue? -Did you find it or not? No, Shy Guy isn't here, but there's a lock there. It says, "I will be your prince on a white horse." [Jong-min] What? Come in where? [Seung-gi] No, I didn't tell you to come in. THEY HAVE COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS Hey. You shouldn't listen to everything -Jong-min says. -Okay. Anyway. So we have to find Shy Guy. He isn't here, but there's a clue up there. -It's moving. -[Jae-suk] What's this? Seung-gi! There's something written on the ribbon! -What does it say? -What does it say? A HINT FOR OPENING THE LOCKS [Seung-gi] We have to untie it. I can't because of my nails. Se-jeong can't untie this. Someone who can untie it needs to come on. -Go somewhere else? -No, you have to help us. Why are you both… [laughs] Why can't anyone hear? [Jae-suk] We shouldn't all be here. We should move on. Let's split up. You can go. -We'll go, then. -Okay. I'm going to barf. I'm nauseous. [Seung-gi] I'm dizzy. I feel sick. I can't untie this. I think I'm going to barf. [Jong-min] I got mine. "Will you sail in my heart that's as vast as the sea?" -"Will you sail in my heart…" -"…that's as vast as the sea?" Where's the sea? -[Jong-min] I don't know. -There it is. -Where? -[Seung-gi] There. The Viking ship. -[Jong-min] Viking ship? -[Seung-gi] Viking ship. [Sehun] Why did he plan something so complicated? -People must propose here. -Hey. Hey! -What? I hear something. -[man 2] Hey! Can't you share? -[Kwang-soo] Is it him? -[man 2] Dang it. The proposal… -What? -Where is he? I heard his voice. -What? Do you see him? -Hey. -[man 2] Hey. -[Sehun] What is this? -Go in. -Guys. There are birds here. Gosh. -Guys. -I can't catch them. [surprised shouts] "The birds will tell you a secret once they're full." THE BIRDS WILL TELL YOU A SECRET ONCE THEY'RE FULL [Kwang-soo] Do we really have to feed them? [comical music] -[bird chirps] -It touched me! They're too big. -[Sehun] Kwang-soo. -Yes? -May I wait outside? -What are you talking about? Get over here and solve this. I think we need Se-jeong. Just come and try. I'm doing this, so feed the birds. -You want me to feed them? -Here it is. What? [Kwang-soo] Tae-uk and Seo-ri. We probably have to open this. -Feed them. -We just feed them, then they'll tell us the code, right? Ravi. I can't do this. -Hey. Hey, you. -I can't do this. [tense music] [tense music continues] THE SLANT-FACED GRASSHOPPER IS FROZEN STIFF -Sehun. -Yes? [Sehun laughs] Sehun. -Hold on. -Hey! [Kwang-soo] Sehun! [slowed shriek] [slowed shriek] -Don't come closer! No! -[laughter] Open the umbrella! -What? -Open the umbrella! Open the umbrella! Hurry! Come in here, Sehun! I'm seriously-- It bit me! -Kwang-soo, I'm too scared. -I'm serious. -Hey. I'm serious. Come in. -[Sehun] There are too many. It's biting me! They bite! [Kwang-soo] What the heck is their problem? GREENHOUSE FOR COUPLES: ROMANTIC PROPOSAL COURSE WEDDING HALL [Min-young] This must be the wedding hall. [shoes clacking] [bell ringing] "Love is hiding where an object becomes two like you and me." Am I the only one here? Should I go in? It's a wedding hall. [suspenseful music] A mirror. Where an object becomes two. A mirror. Is there another one? There's another one. These two mirrors. What's the relationship? AN OBJECT BECOMES TWO… DOES IT MEAN A MIRROR? Goodness. So we meet again. [Min-young] Hello. Should we look together? [Bo-hyun] Where are you going? Let's team up. [Min-young] There's another one. If an object becomes two, -it means it's reflected. -Right. -That's a mirror. -Exactly. I went to the direction the mirror faced, and ended up here. I looked up, and there's another mirror. [laughs] [Bo-hyun] Wow. Should we go up? [Min-young] A mirror. [Bo-hyun] As expected, there's another mirror. THE MIRRORS LEAD SOMEWHERE There's a mirror here, and another one there. Naturally, there will be one outside. As expected. [door opens] There's another mirror here. Let's see. [Bo-hyun] Okay, locks. [Min-young] This is it. "Tae-uk, heart, Seo-ri." [suspenseful music] [phone vibrating] UNKNOWN CALLER [man 3] Yes, it's ready. [Sungwoon] Help me. I think I have to figure out the code to the lock. "Let's put teddy bears next to our future family portrait of you, me, and our child that looks like you." Teddy bears. Teddy bears. Teddy bear. Teddy… There aren't any bears. There's a tiger, rabbit, puppy, dinosaur, pig, turtle… Is that a bear? It says "70 percent." This teddy bear costs 10,500 Won. TEDDY BEAR COSTS 10,500 WON There's another bear. Hold on. There's another one. There are three. Three at 70 percent off. That's a 4 and 15… And 4… So it's 9450. [Sungwoon] It's 9450. Nine. Four. Yes. It opened. -Do you see anything? -Do you see it? -[Seung-gi] No. -Keep riding it a few more times. But I'm dizzy! -Of course. It's a boat. -Where is it? -Where is it? -Look. There it is! Hold on! -What? Where? -[Seung-gi] "Into my heart." Where? I see it! "Into my heart." "Entry ticket." [Seung-gi] "There is only one entry ticket into my heart." Just one ticket? Ticket booth? -There it is! -[Seung-gi] Where? "There is only one entry ticket." Why are there so many calendars? [mysterious music] Calendar. It's May. Why does this calendar say September? Hold on. So it's 0919. IS 0919 THE CODE? -Is the code 0919? -No. That's 0919. [ruffling] [clicking sound] I got it. [Jong-min] How? There's a word in here. [Seung-gi] There's a word here. WRITING HIDDEN IN THE LOCK What? [Sungwoon] Hold on. I FOUND THIS IN THE GIFT SHOP -The others must have more. -They must have different words. THERE MUST BE OTHER WORDS WRITTEN ON LOCKS IN OTHER AREAS AMUSEMENT PARK: YUN GIFT SHOP: EU This isn't it. No, I can't do it. I really can't do it. I really can't do it. THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE BIRD FEED BASKET [Ravi] "Marginata"? -What's that? -What is this? I'm not sure. You need to share that. -We'll just take it. -That's not it. I mean… -Sorry. -You can't take it. But we outnumber you two to one. Don't waste our energy. Exactly. Sorry, but do you want to become bird feed? Guys! You're not playing fair. -We should play fair. -Look. It's raining, so no one will hear you. -Kwang-soo. -What do you mean? -I'll hold his arms, so… -What are you talking about? Look. Do you want to be humiliated and have it taken from you? [Ravi] Look. -Sehun, why are you running away? -I'm too scared. -I'm too scared. -Don't do that. -I'm really scared. -Don't do that. [Sehun] We need to share. MARGINATA -We can solve it together. -There's nothing here. There's no need to do this. I'll solve it. I need your help. Maybe it's a code for the numbers. I have to find a flower called "marginata." MARGINATA DOES THE PLANT HAVE A CLUE? [playful music] Tashinama? Ji… Na… [Sehun] Is this a flower? What's this? Dracaena marginata. It must be in here. Dracaena marginata. -Ravi! -Yes? -Where are you? -The hint is "najimata." -Najimata? -Najimata? -The flower najimata must be in here. -Najimata? A flower? Did you find something? -Oh, my gosh. I thought it was a mirror. -[Kwang-soo] What do you mean, a mirror? -It's obviously not. -We have to find the najimata. -Did you find it? -This isn't the marginata. Najinata. Najimata. -This isn't the marginata. -No? -Did you find some clues? -We found a lot. -Really? -Yes. My gosh. My heart is racing so fast. [Kwang-hee] Did you check this side? -Let's go. -Hold on. Marginata. I checked everywhere already. -They left. Let's go. They left. -Let's go. What is that? Kwang-soo. Look. Do you see anything? There's something tied here. Can I untie it? -Can I untie it? -Untie it. SPEED IS CRITICAL IN A COMPETITION How did we find this? This is crazy. -How did you see this? -Right? Isn't it crazy? Hey. How do we get out? -That way. Run. -Hey. Hey. Run. I think I know what this is. What? What's going on? -Get over here. -What is it? -Take it out. -What is it? -What is this? -Take it out. -Take out what? -That thing. We have to wrap it. We have to wrap it around this. Yes. This is it. I was right. Sehun, this is crazy. Sehun, do you mind taking a picture of me solving this by myself? -I did. It's clearly you. -From far away. Make sure you see me. I AM A REAL DETECTIVE What is this? It's a code. -The lock. -It's the code. We have to open it. This is insane. -This is… -Isn't it insane? I'll never forget this for as long as I live. HE HAS A STORY TO TELL HIS GRANDKIDS This is amazing. I was shocked. How did this happen? We were totally like FBI agents. FOR COUPLES: ROMANTIC PROPOSAL COURSE This is amazing. Yes. We did it. "Mot"? -Hey. -How do we see that? [Jae-suk] How can we see that? It's 2145. -2145? -2145. [Se-jeong] "A rose is red and a baby's breath is white." -Maybe we should look for a pink flower. -Pink. [Se-jeong] All the pink ones say 0815. RO [Seunghee] It worked. "Yun." -[Kwang-soo] It opened. -"Bon." BON BON YUN EU MOT PUL RO SUM RI I put them together, and I got "ri." Hold on. In order. You had "ri." -Ri. -Mine was "bon." -Bon. -Mine was "yun." And "mot." We saw "mot." We solved it together. -Jae-suk. -[Seung-gi] Are you here? -Check the group chat. -There's a pond back here. Is this it? -I think so. -There's a pond -behind the wedding hall. -Hey, Seung-gi. There's a pond behind the wedding hall according to the map. -Yes. -I think that's it. -There's a pond? -Yes. That's it. -A pond. -There. If you look at it this way, it's over there. -This way. -Go straight. The pond behind the wedding hall. [Se-jeong] You have to know how to read a map. Here it is. The proposal spot. "Seo-ri, will you marry me?" -[Sehun] Okay. -[Jae-suk] So the clues led to here. [Se-jeong] I think we have to untie the ribbon there. There's something there. -We must have to go there. -Did you find it? Hurry up before they get here! [Jong-min] Something is attached to that ribbon! [Seung-gi] There's a writing. -Jae-suk! -What? Lift the ribbon! That's why we're going. -Gosh. -Seriously. -What is it? -I think we have to go in. -Why? -Do we have to untie it? -What is it? -What is this? What is it? What is this?

Shoot. -What is that? -[water burbles] -Pull it out. -Get it. -It's way too heavy. -Careful. -Okay. -It's over. -Hey! -Come here and help us! It's too heavy! -We'll help you. -Okay. -Please. -We can lift it together. -From there. -Get rid of the water. [grunting] We have to bring it back there. We got it. -Thank you. -Gosh. Thank you. -What is it? -Let's bring it there. Drag it over here. We have to untie this. -Excuse me. -Se-ho. We found it. -Please get away. -We helped. -Yes, you helped, but-- -Thanks for your help-- We just got something huge. You know how much money is at stake. We're not kidding. We peeked… -It's okay! -You can't move it alone. Just look and see what's inside. -This is all for us… -Hands off. It's for us to take care of. So don't even think about it. Okay? Where's Ahn Bo-hyun? Who saw Bo-hyun last? Ravi? -[zipper rasps] -[overlapping shouts] -What is that? -What? -What? -My gosh. What is that? It's a dead body. -My gosh. -It's a body. -Isn't this Seo-ri? -[Sungwoon] Is it Seo-ri? I think it is. -My gosh. -There's a scarf around her neck. She was strangled. [Se-jeong] I think it's the scarf from the love letter. That's why she possessed her and asked us to find her. -That's why she asked us. -Exactly. THE CLIENT ASKED THEM TO FIND HER AND HER BOYFRIEND YOO TAE-UK Yoo Tae-uk! -Someone call the police. -Should we untie the scarf? My gosh. -Should we remove it? -Who is that? Shy Guy! -Get him! -Don't let him get away! -We got him! -Is he Shy Guy? It is. It really is him. -Where were you? -He has a mole. -It really is him. -It's him. -The scar. -That's him from the picture. -Who are you people? -The hair. YOO TAE-UK, SHY GUY KIM SEO-RI'S BOYFRIEND [thrilling dramatic music] -It is him. -It is. It really is. You murdered your girlfriend, right? [Jong-min] You faked a proposal and lured her here. And you strangled her to death. [thrilling dramatic music continues] She was overwrought by her grudge and possessed someone and told us where she was. That's why we fished her out. -Are you people insane? -What? Seo-ri died already. How could a dead person tell you anything? We may not be able to arrest you, but you should go to the police and tell them the truth. You're the prime suspect. -[gunshot] -[flesh pierces] What happened? What happened? -Step back! -Oh, my gosh. -Where did it come from? -Where is he? Is he really dead? -There! Over there! -Where? -Where? -Through the trees! DID THE SHOT COME FROM THE WEDDING HALL? -Up there! He's up there! -Okay. -We have to go. -Up there! -What about this guy? -We have to go. Did someone really shoot from there? -Dang it. What the heck? -What's going on? What's going on? With Ahn Bo-hyun too… What's going on? -Do you know? -No, we're not… -Wait. Hold up. -Where's Bo-hyun? Actually, Ahn Bo-hyun hired us. Fake detectives that I hired will be coming soon. -Ahn Bo-hyun hired us, that's all. -Exactly. Say you'll hire them both for a case. You want me to act like the dead woman possessed me, right? That's right. -You're missing Park Min-young, too. -Where's Min-young? -Min-young is missing, too. -Where is she? -Hold on. -Maybe they're working together. -What? -She would never. Don't suspect Min-young. You should suspect Ahn Bo-hyun. I saw the two of them exchange looks earlier. -I'm Ahn Bo-hyun. -Ahn Bo-hyun. MIN-YOUNG AND BO-HYUN EXCHANGED LOOKS -[Kwang-soo] He was here, right? -Yes, this is it. [Sehun] He was here. You can see from here. -[Jae-suk] This is it, right? -[Sehun] Yes, it is. [Jae-suk] I can see him on the ground. What is this? -[Kwang-soo] Hey, it's that. The scale. -What? -That. -The tattoo. I'm Park Hyo-ju. I'm a local news reporter. [Jae-suk] What is this? "Target profile"? THE MARK THAT THEY'VE BEEN SEEING -What is this? -What is it? It's that organization, right? "It has been fun working with you guys, but the ones who judged the suspects weren't you weak detectives, but we, Hwalbindang. One of you still hasn't received the judgment of the law. You've waited long. You're next, Flower Killer." [Sehun] Seung-gi. AN ORGANIZATION TARGETING THE FLOWER KILLER HWALBINDANG? Who are these people? Hwalbindang? There are too many things that are suspicious. Ahn Bo-hyun is gone. Where did Min-young disappear to? Did Ahn Bo-hyun abduct her? So Ahn Bo-hyun planned all of this. That godmother. That woman. -Yes, the godmother was a woman. -In the video. That person is a good judge of character. "That person"? You must feel… the same way we do, right? -[man 4] But… Godmother. -Godmother? The godmother is Min-young? -Who? What? -There was a woman. -No way. That's ridiculous. -What? The godmother is a woman. You're saying that's Min-young? It couldn't be. The shoes. Those shoes in the video. -The shoes. -Heels. [Kwang-soo] Shoes. -[woman 4] When you went to sell it? -[Kwang-soo] I heard someone in heels. HWALBINDANG'S GODMOTHER… IS MIN-YOUNG? -No way. -The shoes were similar. The shoes were similar. I'm sure of it. They're working together? Min-young and Bo-hyun planned it together? No way. Min-young? She has been with us for so long. -Dang it. -Try calling her. She was so good to you. I can't get through. MIN-YOUNG CAN'T BE REACHED What's going on here? [suspenseful music] [Bo-hyun] Aren't you curious… -[clicks] -…about who we are, and why we're lingering around your team?
