 Ripped by gabbyu @ Subscene First, go to our safe house. If you find our marker there, you will be able to meet me. Where is the book with that mark? Damn, this is hard. What is this? Who are you? Who are you? I've been invited to join the detective team. I'm sorry, but I'm just wondering...

 You need to have this mark though. You mean this? -Oh, yes. This. -Great. Please sit down. She's our new detective. There is something K asked me to pass along to you guys. -Right. -Is this it? Is he K? It's nice to meet you all, detectives. I'm the leader of Project D and your boss, K. I've served one man. My master is none other than K. You are, no doubt, K's Detectives.

 If K sets his mind to something, he makes it happen no matter what. He's a man of enormous charisma. That man is K? -K is... -This is crazy. All of you must have been very surprised by the recent incidents. Even I didn't see them coming. Project D aims to eradicate social evils. A long time ago, we analyzed famous detectives' DNA data and inserted the chip in you guys. However, an unexpected error occurred with those microchips. Due to the side effects, all of you started to lose your memory gradually, so I decided to scrap the project altogether. Some people were against my decision, of course. But I've been observing all of you in secret. And I found out that the microchips are still affecting you all. It convinced me that I would be able to start another detective team with you, so I got M to put you through a test called "Murder Game" in order to evaluate your qualifications as detectives. -Oh, I see. -That's what happened. Through some digging, I found out that Yeon-seok snatched the invitation that was supposed to go to Se-jeong and joined the team. Then my two best men, M... ...and C were killed by him. He ran away, so you should all be careful at all times. There might be a mastermind behind him. I feel terrible about losing them, but the incidents certainly proved your capabilities as detectives. Hence, I would like to formally launch a detective team with you and solve cases for clients. Best of luck to you all. Then I guess we will start getting cases from clients, but are there any now? After that, he started to hide treasures all over the island. The treasures you're looking for today... He died in a storm. -It made a beep! For real! -Is this real? I'm a detective. JEJU ISLAND: THE TRAVEL GUIDE A righteous detective who shows up and solves cases whenever and wherever anything happens to anyone. Perhaps that's why I've developed a habit of observing people lately. Why can't I get a hold of him? Damn, this guy... Even when I'm traveling, my keen detective eyes are as active. Oh, those guys... Get out of our way, please. It's dangerous. Yes, now is the time. She's so weird. This is another habit of mine that I acquired after becoming a detective. -Stay still. -Don't move, Min-young! -Min-young, don't move, okay? -Don't move, Min-young. Lying down on the ground when encountering an obstruction. Wait, what's going on now? Hang on, am I in danger now? Be careful! Thank you. You dropped this. Thank you. This letter is very precious to me. Well... if you don't mind... Oh, excuse me for a second. Hello? I'm busy at the moment. Can I call you back... This is K. Aren't you in Jeju Island now? We got an urgent request, and the location is Jeju Island. -It's a treasure hunt. -A treasure hunt? What's he talking about? -You all got a call from K, right? -Yes. -I heard everything. -Me too. Do we have to find treasures? I heard treasures are hidden here. It will be like a treasure hunt. Isn't the client the director of the museum? -I think so. -Yes. By the way, where is the director? -Let's go in. -Is it this way? It's so nice here. That must be him. -Excuse me, sir. -Director? -Director? -That's... Welcome, everyone! -Hello. -Hello. -Nice to meet you all. Hello. -Likewise. I'm the director of this museum, Woo Hyun. -It's very nice to meet you all. -Hello. Nice to meet you. Hello. Hey, you're being discourteous. -What did I do? -What's that weird thing? Put it down somewhere. -Goodness. -Don't mind him. Gosh, seriously. First, I would like to offer you some tea since you came all the way here. -Please take a cup. -Okay. Please try some. The tea leaves I used were -grown against the wind on this island. -Thank you. It's organic green tea. -Jeju is famous for green tea. -It tastes and smells amazing. -It's such an incredible tea. -Thanks to the ocean breeze. By the way, do you guys know why you're here? Yes, we heard that we have to find some treasures. Yes, that's correct. We've been told to get the details from you. -Treasure hunt. -He skipped me. Sir, you forgot... I must say, this tea is very good. -Yes, it's delicious. -Indeed. All right. I'll explain a few things regarding the treasure hunt. -Listen up. -Okay. The treasures you will try to find today... originally belonged to an old friend of mine. Unfortunately, he passed away. He was incredibly wealthy. He was born and raised in Seoul. He was a funny and mischievous man. My friend, who totally fell in love with Jeju Island, called a number of places on the island gems and treasures. And later on, he called the island itself, "The Treasure Island of Korea." After that, he started to hide treasures all over the island. Real treasures. But unfortunately, right in his beloved Jeju Island is where he encountered a storm at sea... and lost his life. According to his will, I'm holding a treasure hunt today. This is not the first time this event has been held. I invited a few people in the past two years and asked them to find the treasure. But none of them succeeded. That's why we are here today. We are experts. Where did my friend hide the treasure? -Let me give you a hint. -What is it? My friend left a poem about Jeju Island. The hint is hidden in a verse of that poem. -Virus? -Versus? Not virus. Verse, not virus. Verse. -Verse. -A verse of the poem. -Verse. -Oh, a verse of the poem. -You mean a line. -Not virus. Verse, not virus. -Are you really a good detective? -I'm very good. -Really? -You're "very good"? Now... Here is the verse of the poem my friend left. -Take it. -May we take a look? It's here. When you find the treasure, -please call me right away. -Okay. My number is 010583639. -Did you say 39? -Yes. Good luck. -We will find it by all means. -Don't worry about a thing. -Shall we take a look? -Sure. It's written in a Jeju dialect. "Geomun Oreum... Seonheul-ri... Green tea farm... Geudae Gopjeojeon..." This is all we have? -Hints must be hidden in this verse. -We have to find the treasure. We need to know what this means. Exactly. Geomun Oreum is located in Seonheul-ri. -Seonheul-ri? -Yes. It must be a place-name. Seonheul-ri is an area in Jeju Island. -We should probably go there. -Right. With this much information, I would say we're already halfway done. Let's go. What could the rest mean? -Seonheul-ri... -That's an area name. I've been searching on the internet. There is a green tea farm in Seonheul-ri. -A green tea farm in Seonheul-ri. -Yes. -Galdae means "Reeds." -Oh reeds. We have to read something? Please be quiet. -What... -"Hidden." -What? -Gopjeojeon means "Hidden." -Right. -Geomun Oreum in Seonheul-ri... That's where -the green tea farm is. -There will be reeds at the farm. -Something is hidden there. -Something is hidden. Let's go. It's windy. -Nice. -It's so refreshing. We're in Jeju Island. It's so refreshing. It's nice. -This case is... -We just have to find the treasure. There is nothing scary. Look! Cows! Look at the cows! They are roaming so freely. Their meat must taste great. What? If you're that hungry, drink some water. What an interesting train of thought. "They look so free. They must taste great." That looks like a green tea field. -Reeds... -We're here. -Right. -We must be here. It's a green tea farm. I see both green tea plants and reeds. -We're here, right? -I think so. IT'S HIDDEN IN THE BIG GREEN TEA FARM AMONG THE REEDS -It's huge. -What's that? Something is written here. "It must have been easy so far. You need luck to find the treasure. Each passage leads to a hint. You need every hint to open the treasure chest." Is it like a Korean ladder game? You have to follow the passages. I never got to meet that man, but he must have been very wealthy. He prepared all this. -Exactly. -Right? Well, who should go first? -What about Sehun? -I choose number five. How do you do it? -Go further in. -Turn right. -Where am I supposed to go? -To the right. There you go. That's how it works? -Yes. -Do we have to make turns? So that's how it works. Interesting. I guess no two people will end up at the same spot. -You need luck. -There is something here. -What do you see there? -Stay there for now. Please... Holy crap! Hey! Did you open it? -What is in it? -What is in it? -I found something. -And? But I can't take it out. Why not? You have to see this. -Take it out. -Hurry here. What could it be? I'm curious. -What does he mean? -He can't take it out? -What is it? -He can't take it out of the chest? He's looking very carefully. Is it fake? Is it real? It looks real. -What is it? -He can't take it out? Why can't you take it out? Let me take care of it. Just a second. What is it? -It's too far away. -I mean... -Look at him. He is surprised too. -What is it? Kwang-soo is surprised. -I think we have to give up. -Why? -Come take a look. -This is frustrating. What? -Kwang-soo, open your chest. -He'll open it. WRITE YOUR NAME IF YOU WANT TO FIND THE TREASURE What's wrong? -What? -What happened? Well... -What's wrong? -It's nothing. Write your name I can just go straight. What was it? What was in your chest? Oh, my! That's why I said we should give up. What's going on? What happened to Min-young? What's happening? Oh, my! It's a real snake. Oh, my! Gosh, I'm freaking out. -What's that? -What's that? What's going on? -We're being played. -I know. This is why no one has succeeded. -I'm so curious. -What could it be? Min-young is opening her chest. -Gosh! -What is in it? -What is that? -What did you see? What is it? -Did you see something? -It's something weird. -It's something weird. -Open it. What's weird? What is it? What is it? What is it? Open it. What is it? I can't see it. Octopuses. Are they alive? You said you ate raw octopus yesterday. What's the fuss? I thought it was something else. -Unbelievable. -Octopuses? They are in mud. What's going on? -There you go. -It's so high. What did you find? What was that? What just happened? Come here. What's going on? Why won't you tell us what you found? Gosh! My gosh. So this is how it feels. I'm so relieved. What's that? A pocket watch? -It's a compass. -It's a compass. A compass? Do I have something too? -You do. -I have something too. A compass? Every chest must have one. Just open the chest. Wait. -What is it? -What is it? -There is another chest inside. -Right. Will there be more chests? Open it. I can't open it. What? -There's nothing. -Did you find anything? There's nothing. That's why we couldn't tell you anything. What is this? It's open. We have found nothing. Maybe something's in there. My goodness. -Oh, my! -My goodness. My goodness. Oh, my god. Are you all right? -Are you okay? -He went too far. I can't believe that man. Detective Yoo. -Are you okay? -What should we do? -Come here. -What is this? What's going on? -I mean... -Please stay away. -What is this? -I mean... -My goodness. -He's completely covered. Detective Yoo... My goodness. -He was born for this. -Are you sure you can do this? How could it hit him so perfectly? -You should have been careful. -Let's look at the clues. Sehun, what did you find? -Open it. -What's in it? -Gosh. -What's in it? -What is it? -My goodness. -Really? -Gosh. It's staring at us. -It's staring at Jae-suk. -Close it. Close it. What if the snake gets out? Well... Why Jae-suk, of all people? You're completely covered. He chose the number himself. Are you usually unlucky? Listen, it should have been someone else. Jong-min, for example. Mine was pretty nice. -I can see that. -What's that? -What's that? -Press it. -Gosh. -What happened? What's wrong? -Did it startle you? -I'm sorry. -I lost it. -It felt weird. I kept pressing it, wondering why my finger was tingling. Jae-suk falls for every trick. He falls for it every time. Gosh, we have to open that chest though. -Yes. -Maybe we need to combine our clues. Maybe. Every chest has a compass in it. -What should we do with my snake? -Hold on. -We will have to give up on that. -Leave it alone. Something is under the snake. Something is under it? -It must be a clue. -There is something. It's getting out! It's out! Put it back in! -Put it back in! -Hold on. It's driving me crazy. Gosh. -Kwang-soo! -Look! It's getting out! Close it! -Close the chest! -It's getting out. -It's getting out. -Close it, Min-young! It's getting out. -What are you doing, Min-young? -Don't do that. -What are you doing, Min-young? -Don't do that. -Stay away. -Be careful. She's crazy. Why did you push me? -You've fallen so many times. -You pushed me. Gosh. Min-young must be crazy. -She's trying to touch it. -Wait. -Let's talk first. -Just take the clue out. -Don't touch it. -Just take the clue out. -Lure it with food. -Min-young. -Look at her. -Hey! -She's crazy. -She's touching it. Take a look. -Hey. -What are you doing? Where is the clue? Where is the clue? I found it. Go away! We found it. You guys look so funny. Se-jeong! -Are you crazy? -What is wrong with you? What are you doing? What are you doing? Stay away. Seriously. Put it back in. Don't drop it. Go away. -What's with her? -Seriously. -It's so funny. -You've done your job. -It's gentle. -It is. It looks gentle on the outside, but it can lose its temper. -Why are they touching it? -I'll deal with the octopuses. It's completely covered. -It's so funny. -That's scary. They laugh right after screaming. That's scary. Come here. Detective Ahn. -Come over here. -What's with him? -Come closer. -Are you really a detective? I hate snakes. -No one likes snakes. -They are... They must live in the mud. -They must be very strong. -Right? But they won't bite you. -It's okay. -Don't worry. They won't bite. -They are octopuses. -They are safe. -They won't harm you. -Stick your hand in. Min-young, just stick your hand in there. -Find the clue. -It's here. You found it? We found it. Oh, my. The octopuses feel nice. What are you talking about? -These three... -They are different from us. They laugh while holding octopuses. -They are different. -They are so happy. I have to admit that they do look tasty. They really do. -Gosh. -Octopuses were not that bad. Good job, everyone. -Let's do it. -That one. -What? -I have a chest. -But it's locked. -You found something? This... looks like a compass. Aren't you supposed to turn it in a certain direction? We have to open it. -Right? -It's locked. -I don't think we can... -How are we going to open it? -Why don't we just smash it open? -Hey. -We can't do that. -I'm getting annoyed. -Let's start over. -Let's do it in that order. The thing is, Se-jeong's chest was the last one. -Who checked the first chest? -Me. -W, three? -Yes. One, two, three. The second chest? -Sehun. -Sehun? -Sehun? -Here. -W, two. -W, two. W, two? One, two. -Next? -Me. -Kwang-soo. -W, two. Again? W, two. This is Min-young's. -Next? It's me. E, four. -It's you. -This one? -One, two, three, four. Mine is E, one. E, one. -We're done. -Open it. -We're done. -What happened? Hold on. Let's do it like this. Place the compasses in order. -First... -Detective Ahn. I mean... you were hiding over there when we took the snake out. Suddenly... -What are you doing? -Don't do that. Hey! -Look at her. -Hey! Go away! Stay away. Seriously. All he does is talk. -He's so typical. -Let's have a talk. Place them in order. Put Min-young's first. -Here. -Like this? -Do we have five of them? -Correct? It's three, two, two, four, one. -Hold on. -Wait, what about this? There are two same numbers. Put them in the order of the numbers, and it will be E, W, W, E. -It's one, two, three, and four. -I understand. -E. -W. -W. -W. -E. -No. E, W, W, E. It might work. -It's open. -Yes! -What did you do? -Explain to us. Ignore the same numbers. -I see... -It's one, -two, three, and four. -I still don't get it. How did you do it? -It was so easy. -Good job. -Good job. -I was too late. There is a chest over there. And... What's that? -Pull it all the way out. -What is this? -There is a corpse. -What? -What's that? -Gosh. -This isn't the end? -Hold on. -What is it? -Oh my gosh. Oh, my gosh! Man, it's really... He has been dead for a while. That person said so earlier. That it's been a while since he died. But he said that it happened by the sea. -What was he doing? -We can't just conclude who it is. Let's open this chest first. Oh, my. "Below the life that faces one another, a red candlestick pointing to the sky. The golden pupil that was asleep, that is where the treasure awakes." -What? -The verse mentioned earlier? The virus? Not "the virus," the verse. The verse? Hang on. Shall we check the pockets? Shall we turn it over to check? We have to look at these and find out if these are from a gun or a knife. Is this the treasure? A ring. He hid it here. Did he pass away after finding it? Is this the treasure? "Below the life that faces one another, on the red..." He doesn't even have a wallet. There is nothing. THE GOLDEN PUPIL THAT WAS ASLEEP, THAT IS WHERE THE TREASURE AWAKES This is too difficult. -Hey, look. -What is it? What? -Hello there. -He scared me. -Nice to meet you. -Hello. Oh, hello. -How did you... -What are you doing? -Well, we are just... -Hello. It's nice to meet you. I'm Mr. Joo from Tamla Daily News. -Oh, you're a journalist. -Yes. I'm from Seoul and... He is the person that I met yesterday. You got his number? -I told you back in the car. -No, she didn't get it. I tried to get his number, but he disappeared without giving it to me. Do you have a girlfriend? No, that's not it. The truth is, it's my first time in Jeju Island. I didn't know the direction well, so I was wondering where I should start looking. Then why did you leave so suddenly? I just went my way. Oh, I see... I guess it wasn't meant to be. You are really obsessive. Come on. -Anyway... -What is that? -Is that a dead body? -Well... -We didn't... -We found him. -Did you kill him just now? -No! -If we killed him just now... -He's already a skeleton. -How did you know to find him here? -Well. The director said that there are treasures hidden here and there, and he asked us to find it. That's why we are here. The truth is, I'm here to find it too. -Oh, really? -Last year, a colleague of mine participated in the treasure hunt. I'm not here as a journalist today, but I'm here to look for it too. The truth is I wanted to participate in the treasure hunt last year, but something happened, so I decided to participate this year. Let's look for it together. What have you guys found so far? There is some sort of writing inside that. Can you help us interpret that writing? You might not know well since you just got here. Oh, I think I know what this means. -What is it? -What does it mean? The Chinese character that is used for "life" is incorrect. -It means "bright." -Yes, it means "bright." -Bright? -It isn't the character for "life"? -No. -That's right. -That's right. -Life. It's the character for "bright." -Bright. -Life. What lives in Jeju Island? Pigs? Pigs. It's the black pig. -Pigs? -Black pigs. How did you get that from the character "life"? -It's the character for bright. -That's right. It's the moon. So, pig and moon. It has to be Dot Oreum. Then, the Darangswi Oreum? The Darangswi Oreum's crater looks like that of the moon, so it's called Wollangbong. Then it's between those since it said that they face one another. Facing one another! Maze Park! -Maze Park? -I saw a red candlestick there once. -There is something like that there? -Yes! I've been to the Maze Park once. It's easier than I thought. I think it might be something else. The red candlestick... I was thinking of a lighthouse. -I thought so as well. -A red lighthouse. So which lighthouse should we go to in Jeju Island? There is more than one. I think there are about 4,000 lighthouses. If we look at the map here, the lighthouses are indicated. -Really? -Let's check our location, and find the ones that are close. Then... a group can go to the lighthouse, and the other can go to Maze Park. We can split up. I have a car. This guy... I'm not certain, but I'm a little suspicious of him, so I will go with him. Let's hurry up. We are running out of time. I'll call it in on the way. -Let's keep in contact. -Okay. Let's do that. -Get a lot of clues. -Lighthouse team, wait. I was pondering whether to mention this earlier, and I'm not so sure if this is right. Do you happen to know what paja is? -"Paja"? -"Paja"? Paja is when you break up the Chinese characters into its strokes. The paja for "life" is the character for cow. The paja for bright is the character for day. The characters for day and moon. What comes to your mind when you think of cow in Jeju Island? For cow? -Udo! -Oh, Udo! -Correct. Udo is here. -Is it right? That was right? Udo is here. If that's Udo... Doesn't it make you think of Seongsan Ilchulbong? -They are close. -Where? Udo and Seongsan Ilchulbong. Didn't it say it was below something? -Below the candlestick? -"Below the life that faces one another." Look at this. See what it says. -Hado. -Hado. -The Chinese character "Ha" means "Below." -Below. That's right. It has a red lighthouse. Hado. That's right. Hado. So, it is a fishing village. Oh, the lighthouse. -What is it? -The lighthouse. The lighthouse over there seems like the one we're trying to go to. -How... -There is no way for us to get there. There is no bridge. "Below the life that faces one another, a red candlestick pointing to the sky. The golden pupil that was asleep, that is where the treasure awakes." Since it's a golden pupil, -the lighthouse must be on. -Blinking. -To the sky... -So we have to go over there? How can we go there? Or could it mean the sunset since the sun is golden when it sets? Golden... Is there someone we can ask? Or if you look over there, Detective Ahn, there is something like a buoy over there. Right in front. Look over there. On the right. What are those? -What is it? -Aren't those buoys? -It's there. -In the ocean? -There is something. -Yes, three. Since there are three, isn't it a face with eyes and a nose? In my opinion, we should take a boat to see what is out there. That's not a bad idea. What boat can we take? -We won't have to swim, would we? -I hope not. -Is this the right place? -Of course, this is the Maze Park. -This is the maze. -It's a maze. If we make a wrong turn in the maze... I'm not good at things like this. Are you good at anything? How could you say that? What is over here? The treasure is here. -What about the candlestick? -There is probably a red candlestick. "Probably"? We came here because you said so. Yes. It will be here. I'm sure of it. "A red candlestick pointing to the sky..." Right. I love you like a red candlestick What is it? The red candlestick? For the first five people to make it out in 30 minutes, there will be prizes. What? Wait. Hold on. -Don't push. -Wait. -Hold on. -Min-young! Min-young! Hold on. Min-young! Oh, my. Min-young. Hold on. Our group... -Min-young! -Our group... -Wait. -Our group... What about our group? -Careful! -Our group... The five of us... Who are you? -Wait. -Please don't push. Our... -Jae-suk! -Where are you? Where is Min-young? Let's change our clothes first. In the afternoon, when the tide is ebbing... They're here. What a stud. Just looking at them makes me feel reassured. Don't run away with the treasure after you find it. We were the ones who got a request regarding the treasure so... Let's head to the boat. Did he think of hiding it inside? What an interesting person. The waves aren't strong as I thought it would be. What a relief Yes. Oh, there it is. Can you see it? Are there three? -Just three. -You're right. In my opinion, the treasure is probably over there. Isn't that why we are all headed there? Because the treasure is there. The closer we get, the surer. You just felt sure? Oh, I see. It's golden! That's right. What is that? -It's shaped like an eye! -They are eyes! Those containers are the eyes and the mouth. That is the mouth. The mouth! -A smiling mouth. -I see. Let's get ready. You're the best, Sehun. He's going in. -Find the treasure! -Good luck! -Good luck! -Good luck! That's it! -Weren't we here before? -I think we are going in circles. Where are we? -Aren't we back where we were? -What? -What's going on? -They are here again! Why are you doing this? What are you doing? What is going on? What are you doing? Hold on. Wait. I have to go that way. -What are you doing? -I have to go! Oh, man. Hold on. Where? -I have to go that way. -Where? -I have to go... Hold on. -Where? What on earth is going on? What are you doing? -I thought I could hide. -Gosh. -How could you try to hide? -Hang on. Where are you? Wave your hand. Kwang-soo! We can't go backwards. They have such big shoulder pads. They were like a strong current. -There is Min-young. -Min-young! I don't think there is a red candlestick here. It's blocked. It's really blocked. Mr. Joo doesn't know anything. -I'm feeling dizzy now. -Weren't we here before? It's here. Look over there. -The red candlestick. -Here. I told you so. BELOW THE LIFE FACING ONE ANOTHER, A RED CANDLESTICK POINTING TO THE SKY This is the place. Hey! It's here. THE GOLDEN PUPIL THAT WAS ASLEEP, THAT IS WHERE THE TREASURE AWAKES -Here it is. -There is a treasure chest. Min-young. Mr. Joo, it's really here. -I really did see this. -I'm sorry. -Sorry. -How could you suspect me? -I'm sorry. -You were right. I told you so. I saw this once before. -I couldn't remember since it is a maze. -You were right. Wait, the chest... Is it heavy? It looks like it's tough to open. -It's open. -Is there a key? Why don't you try opening it? Yes. My goodness. Min-young, how could you be like this? Sehun! Sehun? It's taking longer than I thought. It is taking a while. BELOW THE LIFE FACING ONE ANOTHER, A RED CANDLESTICK POINTING TO THE SKY THE GOLDEN PUPIL THAT WAS ASLEEP, THAT IS WHERE THE TREASURE AWAKES -They came up. -They came up? Hand it to me. -What's going on? -You found it! It's gold! Hand it over to us first. It's heavy. Good job. You did a great job. But there is a sound coming from the treasure. -It's opening. -What could be inside? -What is it? -What is it? A letter? Oh, man. What is it? Could it be a clue and not the treasure? -It's a letter. Se-jeong, can you read it? -Okay, I will read it. "You have also made it to here. I came here before you to take the treasure. This was a fake that the rich man had planted. We misinterpreted it. That rich man is extremely detailed. But I found another good one. It's a very important piece of information. If you are curious, come to where we planned to meet. You're not going to run away, are you? The fact is you're an accomplice too." What does that mean? -"Jeong-seok"? -What does it mean? -"Jeong-sik"? -"Jeong-sik." It's a message for someone. The only person who knew about the red candlestick was you, Mr. Joo. -Maze Park. -Maze Park? I saw the red candlestick there once. -There is something like that there? -Yes! So this means that there is more than one perpetrator. There are at least two. An accomplice of this person called Jeong-sik. It says to come to where they planned to meet to get important information. Jeong-sik? Who is that? Actually, he is someone I know. -What? -What? I don't know why he wrote this, but I do know where we planned to meet. Let's go. Wait. Doesn't that mean he is the accomplice? THE FACT IS YOU'RE AN ACCOMPLICE TOO. I'LL BE WAITING! Mr. Joo! We should follow him. It's not like we have any other choice. Hurry up! Mr. Joo, tell us what is going on. Who is Jeong-sik? -Someone I know. -So who is this person? He's not hanjeongsik, the Korean food. Just come along. -That is a terrible joke. -Come on. Seriously? I'll read it. -"Dearest Jeong-hui... -"Jeong-hui"? I think about you every day and it makes my heart ache. From when I wake up in the morning, until I close my eyes at night, the image of you glimmers in front of me. If I had just one wish, it is to go back to that beautiful place with you." What is on the back? "A thousand gopdak gwee gamin, somang, ilruwajimae." Jeong-hui. An unexpected character appeared. Who is Jeong-hui? Hello. Hello. Young man, you must be from Seoul. How did you know? You seemed familiar. -Me? -Yes. -I thought he was from Jeju Island. -It's his first time here. I'm from Seoul. It's my first time in Jeju Island. I didn't know the direction well. He said it was his first time here. -You seem familiar. -I'm from Seoul. Where have I seen you? -This is strange. -This is getting suspicious. No. Didn't you say that it was your first time in Jeju Island? This is strange. Should we show them the letter? Oh, yes. We would like to ask you something. We would like you to translate the Jeju dialect for us. Oh, you want us to translate this. "A thousand gopdak gwee gamin, somang, ilruwajimae." You know what thousand is. Gopdak means beautiful in Jeju dialect. So 1,000 beautiful... Gwee means cave in Jeju dialect. -A thousand beautiful caves? -Yes. Let's look up 1,000 beautiful caves. "A thousand beautiful caves." -I found it. -What is it? Micheon Cave. "Micheon Cave is home to a thousand kinds of beauties." -How did you find that? -That's incredible. Oh, yes! I looked up 1,000 beautiful caves. That old woman seemed to recognize you. -Seriously. -I have never met her before. I am suspicious of you. It sounds like you are lying. Where did you get the address? Jeong-sik sent me the address. We planned to go together, but I couldn't reach him today. -Did Jeong-sik send it? -Yes. -You had planned to go together? -Yes. I couldn't reach him. That's why I came by myself. We reached Micheon Cave. I have a question about the letter. Let's get out of the van. Was Jeong-hui the rich man's wife? Was she his girlfriend? She could be his girlfriend. Jeong-hui is his girlfriend, right? We are looking for the treasure Woo Hyun's friend hid in Jeju Island. We found the treasure and a letter written by his friend was inside it. Jeong-hui is the love of his deceased friend. That's right. -Where did the letter go? -It's here. My goodness. You left me behind. All right. I was stuck. "A thousand gopdak gwee gamin, somang, ilruwajimae." So it is Micheon Cave, which is a popular tourist attraction. Micheon Cave. Inside the cave, we will find -a new clue. -A new clue. -My goodness. -It's so cool. It's a cave. It's a cave. -It's beautiful. -It's impressive. The entrance alone... If there is a sign, take a close look. It could be useful. -What is that? -Is that a tower? -Look. -It's a wish-fulfillment tower. -"Turn left three times..." -"Then turn right three times." When you go to a Buddhist temple, you circle the stone tower -with your hands put together. -That's right. -"Turn left three times." -Make a wish as you go. What is this on the ground? These are alphabets. -I don't think they make up words. -There are five of them. Maybe it's a puzzle we must solve. Hold on. Let's make a wish first. My goodness. Shouldn't we make a wish? -Let's do that. -Okay. Let's circle the tower thrice. I hope everyone stays healthy and finds success in everything they do. What is this? There are alphabets. It's a combination lock. It must hold an answer. I think we need to find the letters that go into the blanks. One, two, three. One, two, three, four, five. -A letter from each sign. -Five letters. Do these make up words? N and A! Look! Both of them have N and A. N and A. We need Min-young for this. She is good at English. Is this the address? It's a village. Why did you park so close to the wall? You only think about yourself. For goodness' sake. Why did you park so close to the wall? We can't get off! This is the address. Is this it? Is this his house? No one is here. Hold on. We need a key. How do we get in? Do you have anything? Does anyone have a stick or a pen? What is it? -I think someone died. -What? A dead body? Are you serious? Is someone inside? Someone has collapsed. -Really? -Yes. -Jeong-sik! -Hold on. -Hold on. -What is going on? -Is he dead? -Who is he? He is dead. There is a picture. Who is he? It's Hong Jong-hyun. Yes, that's Hong Jong-hyun. "A rich man, haenyeo, Jong-hyun." What is this? Young man, you must be from Seoul. -How did you know? -You seemed familiar. You seem familiar. He said it was his first time here. "A rich man, haenyeo, Jong-hyun"? -What is this? -Hold on. Did he commit suicide? -No. -The rope broke. He wouldn't commit suicide. -Do you know him? -Yes. Is he Jeong-sik? Yes. The weasel. There is a bag. -Let's look inside. -There is a bag. What is that? -Repair tool. What is this key? -Repair tool? It must be a key for this place. What are these? Cigarettes? A screwdriver and a tape measure. The door was locked. You are right. -How did he die in here? -There is a window. Look over here. -"I killed a man. -There is a suicide note. I did everything that brought in money. Last year, I came to Jeju Island to find the treasure. During the search, my colleague and I got into a fight. I couldn't control my anger and killed him in a field of reeds. A friend of mine tried to stop me, but it was already over. I suffered from a guilty conscience ever since." A ring. He hid it here. -The skeleton was Jeong-sik's work. -He was the partner. -He killed him. -He killed him. -It was made to look like a suicide. -The suicide note tells us he committed suicide -due to a guilty conscience. -That's right. It's not a suicide. -It's not a suicide? -There is a suicide note. What makes you so certain? To tell you the truth, I am the friend who tried to stop him. -I tried. -What are you talking about? What is going on? -Come on. -Weasel! Don't do this! -I tried stopping him. -What are you talking about? That means you knew about the skeleton. -Yes. -Why didn't you say anything? I felt like I'd be in a difficult position if I did, so I wanted to talk to him to... I can't believe a word you are saying. You told us that you are a reporter. -A reporter. -Was that a lie? You aren't a reporter, are you? Perhaps you killed him. It isn't a suicide? He wouldn't commit suicide. There is a number he called. Who is he? UNSAVED NUMBER Is this Jeong-sik's phone? Yes. The number you have dialed is unavailable. This person isn't picking up. There are no messages. There is a ladder. It would be an easy case to solve if the windows are open. Wait. The killer must have used the ladder. It's long enough. -You can reach the window this way. -You certainly can. This window is locked. What? The doors are locked, but there is a ladder outside. You know, the wound on his neck is strange. -Why? -Why? If he hung himself, -the mark should be on the upper part... -Upper part of his neck. The ligature mark was made when someone strangled him from behind. Was the rope pulled like this? His murderer wasn't tall. Should I lie down? -Min-young. -About my height? -Look. -His height... He's about an inch taller than Min-young. -Really? -Yes. Min-young... Even during our first case... -Min-young! -Min-young! -Stay still. -Don't move, Min-young! Whatever the case is, I think we can be certain that he didn't commit suicide. If he didn't commit suicide, then how did the killer leave the place? The doors and windows are locked. -Right? -He had to lock the door. Yes, exactly. This doesn't make any sense. Is this a locked-room murder case? I can tell that it forms a word as we circle to the left. Another word forms if we circle to the right too. A word must form if we fill in the blanks. Only that makes sense at the moment. -Right? -"Circle three times." The clue... What's this? -The... -I got it! -The fourth combination... -Hold on. I got it. Circling around three times is the key. -Three times? -But I did that already. The keyword is a country. Circle in from the far end. -The far end? -Then... T, U, R, blank, -E, Y. -I see. So the blank is... K in the blank makes Turkey. -That's amazing. -The next word is this. C, O, N, G. "Cong." "Cong"? It's Congo. So O goes in the blank. We have K, O. -We keep on going. B... -B, R. A and then Z. Z. -What's next? -Next... R... A... Is it "bra"? It can't be. -Jae-wook, please. -Hold on. -It wouldn't be that. -Then... -A, Z. So, it's Brazil. -Yes, Brazil. -B... -So it's R. Again we go around in a circle clockwise. Clockwise? It spells Korea. No way. Try Korea. See? It's Korea! -It's the key. -Is it Korea? T, U... What's that? What's going on? What's that? "Follow behind the... Heobeok... -Haenyeo with a Heobeok... -The people... -The people's teong... -The people's teong alro... will sparkle eolrang pinchik." I also found this too. It says, "2739-3, Namwon-ri." -"Namwon-ri..." -Let's contact the other team. -Let's get out first and call them. -Okay, sure. Is this a locked-room murder case? The door was locked from the inside. MUSEUM DIRECTOR DENIES EMBEZZLEMENT CHARGES The rope is too long for it to be a suicide. "Museum director is between the devil and the deep blue sea." What? "A museum director trusted by many was found to have been on numerous vacations to Southeast Asia." They suspect gambling. The director must have been... That number! -What? Wait! -The number! I wrote it down. When you find the treasure, -please call me right away. -Okay. -My number is 010... -Zero one zero.. -Five eight three six.. -That's right! He was on the phone with the director. -Is he the killer? -He isn't answering. He's our prime suspect. -Right. -Right? I see you made it here. I think we will know for sure if we solve how the murderer got in. I think the director killed this man. -But the key... -Why was it on him? I know. It was in Jeong-sik's bag. It's right here. Hold on. Can I see the key for a second? -It latches on. -Yes, it does. -Wasn't the bag open? -It was. Let's contact the other team and meet up. -Hello? -Hello? -Jae-suk? -It's me. We solved it. -What? -They solved it? We will tell you later on. We found an address. Text it over, and we will meet you there. -Okay. -Okay, good. Let's head to that address. Over there. -Let's go. -We should look around. Okay, sure. -It mentioned a haenyeo statue. -Right. -Let's look around for it. -It's there! -She has a water pitcher. -Is there water in it? A haenyeo with a water bucket. -There's a road this way. -I see it. There's a road. We're here. This is the place that the other team mentioned. -Detective Ahn. -Over here. Come on over! Welcome. So the verse of a poem we found in the cave has something to do with this place. We translated it partially. We transmitted it by ourselves. -Transmit? -Translate. You mean you translated it. That is a completely different word. Right. Kwang-soo's not one to correct others. -It's a first for me. -Gosh. "The people are empty as it sparkles brightly below." It doesn't quite make sense. -We're supposed to follow this road. -This one? -Yes. -We need to follow it. -Really? -Yes. -The water bucket... -We solved that so far. -The haenyeo's... -The road leads back there. -There's a road down there. -We will find a new treasure. -Alro means beneath or below. -I see. -I see one or two. -What do you see? -Wait. -I see something. -This is it! -Something is there. So that's what it is. The shape is quite distinctive. During the day, the horizon... I get it now. I see the shape. -Right. -Min-young's right. -The shape... -The horizon would... -The horizon would cut through it. -Right. -The key to the lock was Korea. -It was. -You're right. -Exactly. -The poem said something's empty. -That's right. The void is in the shape of the Korean Peninsula. Do you guys see it? -That's what we've been talking about. -If you see... That's what we mentioned. -I can't believe it. -No way. -Follow me. -Is the treasure down there? -We should head down there. -We should. -What will we find there? -Something that sparkles. -Sparkles? -Brightly too. What can it be? If we follow this path... -Something will sparkle brightly. -What could it be? -Do we have to find the treasure? -Could it be that? I think it will be around here somewhere. -Maybe it's down this path. -She's right. -Am I right? -It's here! -Right? -How the hell did you spot it? Min-young, I'm impressed. -No way. -It's really there. You're incredible. What's that? We need a different key. -It's not just any key. -A key? -It looks like a lock. -We need a key. -It doesn't fit. -We should look around. We need a clue to open this chest. -Isn't there a key? -There's nothing here. -I think I have it. -What? -How do you have a key? -Why do you have it? My mom left me something before she died. Thank you. You dropped this. MY DEAREST SON, JONG-HYUN ALWAYS CARRY MY NECKLACE. IT WILL BRING YOU GOOD FORTUNE. I wore it for over ten years. -It's your necklace. -Really? -I always thought it looked like a key. -You are right. Try opening the chest. -There is something inside. -Let's do it together. -It's the right key. -A keepsake. -I will try this key. -It's the right key. I can't believe it. You had the key with you. -It opened. -It opened right away. -Open it. -How strange! -Please open it. -Okay. -My goodness! -You startled me! I couldn't help it. -It's our mark. -It's our mark. -It's our mark. -What is going on? -What is this? -It's the logo of our team. It's our mark. -A letter. -It's the mark on our necks. -That's right. -Yes. Is that a safe? It's a safe. -What is that? -There must be a password. -What is that? -A password. -Look. -What is that? It's a letter. My goodness. "My dearest son, Jong-hyun." I will read it. "My dearest son, Jong-hyun, I missed you my entire life. The two people I loved most in my life are you and your mother." Young man, you must be from Seoul. -How did you know? -You seemed familiar. -I thought he was from Jeju Island. -It's his first time here. "To my son, Hong Jong-hyun, I leave my entire fortune. What I want to give you the most is my love for you. I am sorry. I never forgot you once. I love you, my son." He is your father, right? -His father is the rich man. -That's right. To be honest... it did occur to me, but I was never sure that he was my father. I came to Jeju Island for this. Now that I found it, I am happy. Wait a second. Director asked us -to give him a call. -That's right. That's right. This is the treasure. -Don't call him. -The thing is... We think he is the prime suspect in Jeong-sik's murder. He has no idea that we found -Jeong-sik's body. -No. We only found his body thanks to the address he sent to Mr. Joo. In that case... -Call him. -Let's pretend we don't know anything. -Let's just say we found the treasure. -Right. -The call is going through. -Did he pick up? Ask him about the password. -He picked up. -Yes. Hello. Director. -Yes. -This is the detective team. We found the treasure. Really? Congratulations. You are a talented team of detectives. Where should we go? There is a gym. Let's meet there. There are two people who aided us in finding the treasure. -Really? -Can they come with us? No. Only the seven detectives who were here in the morning are allowed to come. All right. We will be on our way. -Okay. -Okay. It sounds like they figured something out. This must be the place. Why are we meeting at the gym? There he is. -Director. -Director, it's us. This is it, right? Congratulations. Congratulations. Hold on. Something doesn't feel right. -What? -What do you mean? What do you mean? Give us our share please. Don't move. Don't move a muscle. You will get hurt if you move. You talked about two additional people. Who are they? They came to look for the treasure. They aren't important. What did you find? You are struggling financially. It was on the newspaper. You found out many things in just one day. Now, I have a question. Why did you kill Jeong-sik? Come on. Do you have any evidence? -Yes. -Every piece of evidence points to you. You were the last person he called. You made a locked-room murder look like a suicide. -A locked-room murder? -Yes. You wrote a suicide note and brought a ladder from outside to make it look like a suicide. That's right. It's impossible to murder someone in a locked room! You used Jeong-sik's tape measure. There is a hole. Look from outside. It's here. It works. You can sling a key -to the end. -Sling a key. I know what he did. My goodness. This is incredible. You used the tape measure to send the key back into the bag. It works. -Okay. -Okay. -It worked. -It went in, right? -Send the tape measure back in. -The tape measure. Then, you released the tape measure so that it looked like no one entered the room. -It worked, right? -Yes, it did. It came in. -It worked, right? -The location of the objects is the same. The key is inside the bag. Isn't that how you did it? Because of the ligature mark on the neck... The murderer is as tall as me or the director. We learned that the murderer is shorter than Jeong-sik. You are the only man with the similar height. That narrowed down the list of suspects. I remember. I am wearing gloves to hide the rope marks. You are right. I killed him. What a shameless man! Why did you kill him? -That man? -Yes. He deserved to die. You are here. Did you bring the money? Since you are struggling to pay your debts, it must have been hard to procure money. He demanded treasure and money from me. He knew my weakness. You are planning to steal what your friend left behind for his son. -What nonsense are you spouting? -I can't let you take all the treasure. For the treasure, I even killed my partner. He was a piece of garbage. -That's... -He killed his partner! You shouldn't have underestimated me. You committed suicide. Do you have anything else to say? No, we don't. We have your confession. You confessed to murdering him. Go to the police station for investigation. Hold on. -What is going on? -What is going on? -Let's arrest him. -Please don't. He should be arrested. -He has a switch. -A switch? Now that you know my secret, I can't let you go without a fight. Wait, what? -Is something going to drop? -You, tall guy. Have you been carrying that backpack all day? It's not just today. I always carry this around. When you first visited me at the museum, I placed a bomb in your backpack. -What? -That's impossible. Hey, you're being discourteous. Put it down somewhere. Gosh, seriously. Good luck! It's written in Jeju dialect. So... We need to know what this means. That's impossible. What's this? -Are you kidding me? -Seriously? All right. If I press this detonation device, the bomb will go off in three minutes. If I press it twice, it will go off immediately. -Should I press it? -No, don't! You have three minutes. -Now... -It's real. It made a beep! For real! -Think of a solution. -It's a real bomb! -What now? -Here's my offer. One of you will slowly bring the treasure chest over to me. -Jae-suk, go ahead. -Has it been three minutes? I'll press it! -Okay, fine. -Wait a second. Hold on. We will hand it over. Slowly. No sudden moves. Alright. -Here. -Now, go back. -Go back! -Sure thing. Hold on a second. Once I press this button, you will have three minutes to defuse that bomb. You must cut the wires in the right order. -Now... -What order? -What's the order? -And go! -Wait! -Are you serious? -What? -He really pressed it. -But... -Here's your clue. Remember our first encounter in the morning. -The color of the cups! -Do you remember? -What? -I offered you green tea. Let me pour you some tea. -My cup was red. -Everyone line up. -Stand in the same order. -The cups! Mine was blue, yours was yellow. -I was here. -Mine was green. -Green. -Sky blue. -Where are the clippers? -You stood there. -I stood here. -Right. -That's right. -It is. -All right. -Now name your color. He poured you a cup first. It's delicious. -Mine was red. -Yours was blue. -Was it blue or sky blue? -Mine was blue! Mine was orange. Mine was yellow. -Mine was yellow-green. -No, mine was. -What? -Mine was yellow-green. Yours was darker. -Darker? -Let's check the colors. -There's purple. -It's probably yours. -Was mine purple? -Yes. Okay, then. What was your color again? Sky blue. -There isn't a sky blue wire. -What was it... Guys, we have a minute left! -There's only a minute left. -Hold on. -Wait. -Hold on a second. -Which color is it? -Wait a second. What now? -We have 55 seconds. -Go with blue. Mine was blue. Okay. If Se-jeong's was navy blue, then yours was sky blue. -Mine was sky blue. -Then it's this one. -Go with the blue wire. -I'll cut the wire. Hold on a second. -Make sure to only cut one. -In one, two, three. -God! -The red wire is next. -Next is the red one. -The red wire. -Are you sure? -The red one. -I'll cut the red wire. -Min-young, get back. -Sure. -In one, two, three. -Go! -Okay. -Now... -We have 20 seconds left! -Hurry up! -Navy blue is next. -The navy blue wire. -Min-young, step away. -The orange wire is next. -We are running out of time. -We need to hurry! -The orange wire! -Hurry up already. -Cut the orange wire. -Hurry! -Yellow is next. -Cut the yellow wire. -Hurry! -What's next? -It's yellow! -Move away from it. -Green! -Move away from it. -Green! I did it! -He cut them all. -Are we good? We only had three seconds left. Wait, he's running away! -He's running away. -Stop him! -Grab him. -Get him! Stop him. -Where did he go? -Downstairs. Damn, it's slippery. Stop him. I got him! He got into his car. Guys, I got him! -Why would you do such a thing? -That was mean. I would have never put you in danger like that. It isn't a real bomb. -What? -It's a fake? That's right. Is this the detonation device? Check for yourselves. -Me? -Hold on to it, but don't press it. -Don't press it yet. -Don't! Are you going to test it out? -This... - Don't drop it, or it will go off. It's a fake bomb. -The threat was real to us. -Exactly, you never know. -It's real, isn't it? -No, it's not. -That's a lie. -It won't go off. -He says it's a fake. -Step back. In one, two, three. Are you kidding me? -Hey! -How could you? He's sadistic. Unbelievable. -If we hadn't defused the bomb... -Exactly. What would've happened to us? -You all did a great job today. -Right. So how can we open this chest? -What was that? -What is it? It's K. Thank you for coming all the way to Jeju Island to solve the case. By the way, the owner of the treasure is the one who sponsored this project. -But Project D... -Our project... The treasure holds an important secret to Project D. So make sure you don't lose it. It will come in handy someday. Anyway, since you're already in Jeju Island, you should relax for the rest of the day. -Really? -Are we going on vacation? -Is this for real? -We're getting time off. Just know this though. While you're on vacation, those who bear a grudge against our project might seek you out to hurt you. Whatever you do, don't let your guard down. Gosh...
