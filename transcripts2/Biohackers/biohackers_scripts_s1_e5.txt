 My name isn't Mia. I'm Emma. The daughter of Volker and Julia Engels. Emma Engels is dead. My parents died in the car crash. I survived. This is from the accident. -I moved to my grandmother's in Sweden. -Listen... I have no idea how you got a hold of Emma Engels' data. What I am interested in is who you work for and why you're here. Do you remember my brother's funeral? You were there, too.

 You argued with my father in his office. He threw you out. Come with me. Everything okay with you? Yeah. Everything's great. Okay, what's wrong? Mia's lying. What gives you that idea? She faked her profile. Doesn't everyone? She gave Lorenz a false DNA sample. Is that a crime? No, but it's weird. She said she did it for data privacy, but...

 Could be true. Lorenz thinks she works for the Ethics Committee. -You talked to Lorenz about it? -Of course. She wants to destroy our research. You don't know that. It's so fucked up. I've been so blind. JASPER KNOWS Dude, are you even listening to me? Yes, of course. Sorry. What do you say to another round of video games? We can order pizza. My treat. Yeah, okay. Decide what you want. I'll be right back. CALLING MIA... You had a gray cat. What was its name again, Maunzi? We didn't have a cat. We had a dog, Bella. I took her with me to Sweden. She lived to be 14 and died last year. Emma Engels. Do you know what this means? I think so, yes. It means that Homo Deus worked. What do you know about Homo Deus? You wanted to develop a new treatment for genetic disorders. You experimented on embryos with genetic diseases. You crossed a line doing that. My father investigated you. I wanted to know if he was right. If you played a role in Ben's death. And have you worked that out? Yes. My father was wrong. You wanted to cure us. Ben probably lived longer because of you. I'm living proof that your gene therapy works. You're one of the world's most brilliant scientists. I owe my life to you. That's all I ever wanted. To invent something that would change the future of humanity forever. Imagine a world in which no child is born with a disease. I had so much hope for Homo Deus, but it didn't work. At least that's what I thought. Until you turned up. Homo Deus is medicine's Copernican revolution. First of all, we have to sequence your entire genome to find out why exactly the therapy worked on you. It might be a mutation. The analysis takes about 12 hours. Tomorrow, we will rewrite history. Professor Lorenz? Thank you. For everything. Are you ready? Okay, ready. Hey. Yeah. See you soon, okay? Bye. Bye. -I've got to go out again real quick. -Now? Yeah, a buddy of mine is working on a presentation for tomorrow. He's totally stuck. I can't leave him hanging. Okay. I'm sorry. Really. See you later. Why did you do that? Jasper found out that I handed in a false DNA sample. Lorenz would have worked it out. It was a matter of time. I should have been quicker. Yeah, now she has your DNA and knows everything about you. Yes, Niklas. That's the plan. What kind of a plan is that? I am the key. Are you Jason Bourne now, or what? Lorenz genetically modified every Homo Deus child. If I can find out what she did to us, I can find the others in the database. But I can't get to the patients' records on her computer. We need the Homo Deus children's genomes. The samples are in the archive of the Excellence Center. I have to find out where. Yes, but that's dangerous. There's no other choice. It's the only chance I have left. Hey. Come on. Hey. Hey. Going so soon? Listen, I really do like you a lot... but... Jasper is really into you. I just feel like a real asshole right now. I'm sorry, too. But this is also kind of... nice. Right? What'll happen to Jasper if Lorenz has to go to prison? I have an idea about that. -Morning. -Morning. Good morning. Hold on, I think I missed something. -Weren't you with the other guy? -We weren't together. So, those were the noises I heard last night. I thought you had bad PMS cramps or something. But this is so much better. Congratulations on having sexual intercourse! Your first time together? Or your first time ever? -Are you done? -Yeah. We've got a proposition for you. Oh, God. That's really sweet of you, but I make a point of not having sex with my roommates. Though you don't live here. Listen. We have a business proposition for you. -What is it? -Funding a cure for Huntington's disease. And why are you asking me? You have a lot of money, quite a liberal mindset and you could keep 30 percent of the revenue. It's super that you're all here right now. Okay, listen up. Listen up. Here it comes. Magnetic implants. Cool, right? Man, I need to post this right now. Hashtag "Ole Scissorhands!" -I have to go. -Yeah, me, too. You're going now, guys? Now? See you later. You clearly don't have your priorities straight. Unbelievable. Hey, that... Oh, no. Look after yourself, okay? And? Did you sleep well, Mia? Emma? What should I call you now? Whatever you like. Mia is my middle name. I slept well. You? I was so excited, I didn't sleep a wink. The sequencer just finished. So, we're looking for a mutation also present in the modifications I made as part of the Homo Deus experiment. How would you proceed? I would start by comparing my genome with those in various databases. The second step would be classifying all the variant genes into certain cell types based on function. That could be a way of narrowing down the modified cell type. Very good. That's exactly how we'll do it. Niklas? Are you still sleeping? Can I use your printer real quick? ONLINE TICKET FREIBURG - BASEL STATION MS. MIA AKERLUND MR. NIKLAS BENDEL {\an8}TO: MIA - WHAT WAS THAT? TELL ME! CAN I SEE YOU LATER? JASPER KNOWS YOU'RE NOT PICKING UP, CALL ME BACK NOW CALLING LORENZ... So? What are the immune cells telling you? See for yourself. The potential is even greater than I anticipated. You have the best human immune system I've ever seen. This is an entirely new type of gene therapy. I'll be right back. Hey! Fuck. Hello, this is Mia. Leave a message. No idea why they went to Basel. Basel. Monique? Lorenz here. I want you to block access authorization of Mia's keycard now. Yes, correct. Mia Akerlund! Go, go, go, go. Come on. Hey. Everything okay? Niklas, you have to get Jasper's keycard. What's wrong? Something has gone wrong. Lorenz found out I lied. Just get the keycard. We'll meet at the Excellence Center. But... Genetic modification? I assume we're not talking about intentional genetic modification. Not to the human genome. That's totally illegal. Who'd do that? Maybe China, but... It is an intentional modification. You're saying that someone changed your DNA? Not just someone. Lorenz. She intentionally made embryos sick in her fertility clinic to research gene therapies. I was the only one that survived. I need to find out about the others so I can press charges. That means your parents knew and allowed it to happen? Or they didn't and she just did it? How did she do it without anyone knowing? Okay, calm down, Chen-Lu. I'll explain it all later. But you have to help me now. Quickly. Jasper... Look, I know it sounds crazy, but Lorenz experimented on Mia and other kids... Just shut up. What's going on between you two? Scientists who modify an organism's DNA sometimes use a marker gene, like a kind of barcode. That means we can look for synthetic DNA inside you that no other human has. Lorenz marked us with barcodes? Like meat in the supermarket? Let's hope so. Here. A synthetic sequence in your non-coding DNA. That's the base sequence. G-T-A-C-C-T-A-G So if I enter that into Lorenz's database, I'll find all the Homo Deus patients? Thanks, Chen-Lu. -You don't give a shit about me. -That's not true. Really? Hey! I thought you were my best friend. But really, you're just an asshole. Seriously? This? Take it. Come on. Why, huh? Why? And? -Everything okay? -We should hurry. Here. 237 DATA SETS FOUND The Homo Deus children. So many. Okay. Let's get the DNA samples and leave. Here. 307 to 544. Okay, come on. Quickly. What? To the Excellence Center? Go, go, go! Quick! There. Yes, I'm still here. Come here immediately. My God, what did they do to you? Okay, sit down. This will sting a little. Nearly over. Done. Mia and your friend Niklas have managed to steal very sensitive data from the Excellence Center. We need to find out what they want with it. Yes. The train to Berlin. In half an hour. I have the booking confirmation. If this data falls into the wrong hands, it will be the end of our research. And the end of me, too. I have an idea how to get the situation under control. But I'll need your help. Excuse me, may I? -Sorry. -No problem. We're sitting... here. WE'RE ON OUR WAY. You know what? You did it. We did it. Your father would be very proud of you. Yes, like I said. No! Of course we'll continue with the negotiations. The numbers just don't add up. Yes. I'm on the train already. Excuse me, could you help me with my case? Yes, I should be there by 12, if there aren't any more delays. Yes, terrible. No, of course not. -Is anyone here a doctor? -Maybe you can help. Do you hear me? Mommy! -Careful, everyone step away. -Go and-- Fuck. Niklas? Niklas! Subtitle translation by Carina Chadwick
