 -I'm sorry. -I'll press charges. -What you did to Ben... -I didn't do anything. He was sick. You're not getting off that easy. Are you threatening me? -I understand you're upset... -Get out. Out! Ole, what are you doing? Ole, get out! Jesus, Ole! Yes! New record! I found a body hack that makes blood temporarily bind twice the oxygen,

 so I can hold my breath almost indefinitely! You nerd. But it's pretty cool, right? Yeah, it is cool. Want to try one of my underwater pills? Have you had a drink in the last few hours? -Why? -The pills will knock you out. Combined with alcohol, they hit you like a ton of bricks. No pills before breakfast. Thanks. You want an assistant job during freshman year? I'll learn more helping Lorenz with these trials than I would doing introductory courses day after day. There are other ways to spend your time at college. Environmental initiatives.

 -Enjoying life. -Hiking. Getting laid. -A fine pursuit. -Right. -Hey. All good? -Funny. We were just talking about you. -Yeah? -Yeah. How's it going? Fine. Except my roommates are trying to lead me astray. -Oh, please! -I haven't managed that yet. -You haven't tried. -Disappointed? Maybe. We're going to the Schlossberg tonight. You in? If you let me finish filling out these forms. Okay. See you later. What happened between you two yesterday? Whatever you did to him must have been pretty good. Is that his roommate? -I actually think he's cuter. -How is he cuter than Jasper? Not that I'm interested, I'm just intrigued by the decision-making process. -He's looking over. -Does he study biology, too? Why is that relevant to attraction? It's how a person is on the inside that counts. Objectively, he's hot. He has good hair. But what he does is irrelevant. Unless he studies chemistry and researches hair products. Is that what you meant? -Nerd. -Hipster. -Weirdo. -Capitalist. -Waldorf student. -Rich kid. Through and through. -So, Schlossberg tonight? -Say yes, Mia. Yes. Mia Akerlund? Please come to the front. Bring your book. How did you solve question nine? Well, my idea was to directly transfer RNA into the enzyme to replace the mutated sequence of the genome more efficiently. Then to link the guide RNA to the Cas enzyme. Yes. What does that mean? Gene scissors with two parts instead of three? Where exactly in this book does it say that's the correct method? I didn't use the book. She didn't use the book. You all, on the other hand, followed the book's instructions to a T. Please open it to page one. Can anyone tell me what the problem with this book is? No one? It's three years old. Do you know what that means in our field? It's worthless. Outdated. I expect you to know everything in there before you even set foot in my lecture. If you want to keep up with my class, you can't just reproduce methods other people came up with before you. You need to find new ones! Class dismissed. Come back when you're ready to think for yourselves. And throw those books in the trash. You want to get ahead, huh? Then stand by what you know. Modesty won't get you anywhere. I want to assist on your clinical trials. I've filled out the forms. You're just a freshman. Finish the semester first. Modesty won't get me anywhere. At least you're a quick learner. I'm a hard worker, I'm focused and I'm 100 percent reliable. Boring. Blah, blah, blah. If your old professor's biography is right, identifying circulating tumor cells was your idea. It ended up revolutionizing early cancer diagnosis. His upperclassman assistants didn't think of that because they weren't thinking outside the box. Your professor's success is down to a freshman: you. He had the guts to give new talents a chance. Yes. That last part was a bit much, but I'll think it over. Send me your paperwork and be here tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Thank you. -What's that? -Art. Hashtag "homebrewed." Nice. Okay, wow, this stuff really hits hard. Guys, Ole's taking a bio-break! Take your bio-break, Ole. Hey! That poor bush. Men are always peeing without any consideration for the bushes! -Imagine someone did that to you! -Some people are into that. Really. -Hey. -Hello. You guys have met Jasper and this is his roommate... -Niklas. That's my name. -Hey. -Hi. -Hi. -Nice to meet you. -Likewise. We're celebrating Mia's new job. She hasn't confirmed anything yet. She asked you to go tomorrow, so you've got a foot in the door. And if you don't screw up, you'll get the job. Lorenz? Nice. Well, then. Congratulations. -That's what I just said. -Dude. What? I'm just saying knowledge should be common property. A thousand hours in her lab? Work on your own research instead of her next big patent. Just stop it, okay? A thousand hours? That's a lot for one semester, even if you include the break. Are you sure it won't distract you from your studies? So, what distracts you from your studies? Sports. You? Same. I don't care. Working for Lorenz is a huge opportunity. Mom? Dad? -Where are we going? -Berlin. -To meet someone who works at a newspaper. -She's still behind us! Watch out! Mom? Dad? Mom? Dad? Mom! Dad! Were you even listening? Oh, I just asked if you wanted to do something else. Sorry, I was thinking about tomorrow. It means a lot to me. No worries. You're ambitious. Pepper Potts. FROM: ANONYMOUS Do you have new information? Lorenz Excellence Center, one of the leading biomedical research... The leading biomedical research center. -Noted. -Or, better still, "the leading institute." Got it. And please add the standard paragraph about genetic fertility research, okay? Okay. Afraid of someone getting in or something getting out? Our discoveries, our thoughts, our ideas, they pay for all of this. We have to protect what's ours. Do I get one of those? You don't just get a card. You have to earn it. Drinks are prohibited in the lab. You'll get the boot for that. We're conducting a clinical study exploring female fertility and hormone levels in correlation to genetic markers. These are the relevant documents: ethics committee approval, study procedure, blah, blah. Get to grips with them so you can answer test subjects' questions. Have them fill these out: patient information, consent form for lifetime storage of DNA. You store their DNA? Of course. I've been storing all of my patients' DNA since the start of my career. The larger the sample, the better the research. Good morning. I'm Tanja Lorenz. I'll take a saliva sample from each of you now. Mia will explain everything and take care of the paperwork. I can determine sex, ancestry and diseases, current and future, and your expected time of death. I won't do that, of course. I'm only interested in the fertility parameter. Where did number 12 disappear to? She went home. She didn't want to know when she's going to die. -Then you'll have to jump in, Mia. -Me? Yes, you. Or is there another Mia here? Everything okay? You look pale. I'm great. Must be the light. Stay here in case anyone has questions. What happens with the saliva samples now? Jasper sequences them and compares them with all old samples in my database. Should I bring them to Jasper so it gets done quicker? He's not doing it until noon tomorrow. In the meantime, do some more blood work and make certain all the subjects are healthy and have no signs of bacterial or viral infections. Hello! Can't you put on clothes at home for once? Maybe you should take some off more often. I want to go to the lake with Niklas. Want to come? Are you a real blond? It's all real! German boys are so easily scared off, so you can't move too fast. I thought we'd say you and I are going anyway, and you ask Jasper to join, spur of the moment. -Blue eyes. -Okay, you're being a little weird, girl. Any bacterial infections or diseases? Are you crazy? I always use a condom, even when I'm wasted. I'm totally healthy. Okay. We'll go to the lake. You sure? Wouldn't you like to meet my parents first? Nope. "Packs a punch." Ole, those underwater pills... ...and then cut into the skin. -We're getting to the part... -Holy shit. -Oh, Mia! What's up? -Are you crazy? -What are you doing? -Subcutaneous drug distribution chip. -What? -You'll learn about it in grad studies. -Okay. -And pull it down so that it fits in there nicely. Did you disinfect it? -Do I look like an amateur? -Yes! A bit of blood is okay, by the way. It shouldn't be too much, though. -When you've made your cut... -Ole, you're crazy. -...and everything is ready... -I mean it. Like all great artists. Take the thing and shove it under the skin. If you can't really get inside, which has happened to me, then you can make the incision larger. Just... Like this... Okay. Once you have the chip under the skin, take a thoroughly sterilized needle... -Fucking blood. -and sew... Okay. Oh, shit. No, okay. Ole. Stop! Stop! Do you have surgical sutures? Yeah, I have everything. properly knot... No. Leave it, Ole, leave it. Practice on a pig belly or leg, or perhaps on a chicken. -Sure I shouldn't remove that thing first? -No way! My followers are anxiously waiting to see how it works! -How many followers do you have? -It was just over 300 the other day. Okay. But there are other body hackers. -Really? -There's "Double Felix," for example. He has thousands of followers. And the stuff he does isn't even as cool as my stuff, you know? Anyway, forget it. I'm sure my followers will go through the roof when I post my THC implant. You filled an insulin chip with THC? Christ, Ole! What did we say? You can't do that in the apartment anymore. It took weeks to get the blood stains out of the wood floor. Hence the plastic sheets! Are these my nail scissors? Okay, that'll be 370 euros. For real? Or you give me the underwater pills. I'll give you the pills. You feel that? This place has a really special vibe. Alternative, but it sparks joy. You should see it at night. It's really creepy. Howdy! -Oh, hi. -Oh, hi. Kind of a cliché, hanging up laundry topless, isn't it? -People in glass houses... -Have the best view. Hey. -You didn't tell me you live here. -I didn't want to be too brash. -Are you coming to the lake? -I've got a lot of stuff to do. Me, too! Which is why it's good to do nothing for a change. I promise not to talk about medicine or biology all day. -Just about Lorenz. -Not her either. Please. Come on, Jasper. Super cute, but playing hard-to-get is so yesterday. If that's what it takes to get them out of here... -No, finish it off. -I've drank way more than you. Go for it. What's that shit? A nose clip. What? I organized a synchronized swimming party once. They're great. I brought us something. They let you stay underwater twice as long. -From Ole? -Yes. -Bullshit. -We'll see. No. Whoever stays under the longest! Cute. Childish. Crazy how long we were under for. -It wasn't longer than usual. -No. -What? -Sure it was. Want to bet? Then you guys do it! -No! -Stop it! Come on! All together! Worthless stuff! -Ran out of air? -No, it was just so boring. I almost fell asleep! Is this all right with you, colleague? Slightly unprofessional, I'd say. -And this? -I'll allow it. What happened there? Never noticed it before. I usually cover it up. Why? It suits you. Kind of badass. Like you were in a knife fight or something. We had a car accident when I was a kid... and my parents both... Shit. I'm sorry. That's why I cover it up, so I don't have to talk about it. Sorry. Thank you for telling me. Check this, I'll show you. This... is the eagle pose. It sobers you up really quickly. I'd better take her home. More like the puking parrot, right? Thank you. Lotta... Strange, man. I can usually take more. Weird. -Jasper definitely has a thing for you. -Nonsense. And so does Niklas. Nonsense. He does. Yep. The whole time he was like: "Mia this, Mia that, Mia whatever." Totally exhausting. You have a secret. -Me? -Yes, you. Usually the guys think I'm hot. They still do. Yes, because I'm pretty. But hey. That doesn't last forever. Just look at my mother. You've still got a couple of years. You know, I think that if you lack sex appeal, like you do, guys tend to take you more seriously. Oh, man. Why don't guys get that sexy doesn't mean dumb? It's all pretty complicated. Lotta. Thanks. I don't want to let you go yet. You don't want to mess with Lorenz. Work is waiting, and she pays me. What are you saying? Am I supposed to pay you, too? Like this? Come on, my lecture doesn't start for half an hour. I can't let you in. Employees only. But I am an employee. Almost. I mean, you're working on my trial, which pretty much makes me your boss. Okay. Come with me then, you pain in the ass. So, this is where you sequence? Yep. First I'll extract the DNA and do the library prep. Library prep. Drinks aren't allowed in the lab. Sorry, I forgot. -Shit, I'm such an idiot. Sorry. -Just don't move, okay? -I'll get something to wipe it up. -Sorry. -You okay? -I'm sorry I've made such a mess. I shouldn't have come. We'd better keep this to ourselves. -Can I help you? -It's fine. I'd better get going. Okay. I sequenced the samples. They're all on the server. Thanks. How are you getting on? Fine. You were tired the other day in the lecture. You okay? Sure. I'm always there for you if you need anything. I know. Thank you. For everything. We've worked so hard. As long as you don't get distracted from your goals, from our goals, -we'll manage. -I won't let myself get distracted. I know that. Send Mia in if you see her, so she can learn something. Okay. And this is you. Your complete blueprint. Here you can see the SNPs in high definition. What? I expected something different here. Why? You have freckles. But you don't have the correlating gene variant. Strange. You have blue eyes. You're blond. You have everything. The sequencer isn't totally accurate. Jasper must have been a bit sloppy. Mia Akerlund. Okay. You can go. Okay. Have a nice evening. Hey. Welcome to the team. Thank you. TO: ANONYMOUS I'm in! ARCHIVE Subtitle translation by Carina Chadwick
