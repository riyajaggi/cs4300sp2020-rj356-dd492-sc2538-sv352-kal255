 -We need a defib. -Okay. Go find the conductor. We need an ambulance at the next stop. -Okay. -Anyone know where can we find a defib? Mommy? Mommy! Is everything all right? Can you come to me? I don't feel so well. You need to keep pumping. Pump hard. Mommy! Mommy! Okay, I'll help your mommy, but you need to make room for me. Make her better! I'll try. Promise!

 I promise. Niklas, we need a defib over here. Okay. Stay calm and follow the directions: Please take the electrodes and place them as shown in the picture. Okay, come on. -Get up. Come with me. -Analyzing. -Ventricular fibrillation detected. -Careful, everyone step away. Is everything okay? Please continue with cardiac massage. Next shock will be charged. Hey! What's happening? Mia! Fuck. {\an8}2 WEEKS EARLIER REMOVALS 11.99 euros Hello? Hi. Hi. -I'm Mia. -Mia... Oh, yeah. -Want a beer? -Usually not before breakfast. Oh, fuck, I need to go to bed. Come in. The WiFi is "flux capacitor," the password "1.21 gigawatt." Ole set it up. This... is your shelf. Don't eat that! What is it? That's... not edible. Just trying to protect you. And by the way, welcome to the flat. Your room is back there. Good night. Hey, gorgeous. -Okay. -Thanks. -No problem. -What's that? Oh, this? I just implanted an NFC chip under my skin so I can pay at the gas station without tapping my card to the reader. I can do it with my hand. Like this. Then it's paid, you know what I mean? -Sorry. -Are you okay? Can I see? You hit a blood vessel there. Yeah, well, the YouTube tutorial was only semi-accurate. Oh, well. ANATOMY ATLAS This is better than a YouTube tutorial. It's yours. Cool! Thanks! Thank you. MEDICAL JOURNAL LORENZ RECEIVES PROFESSORSHIP IN FREIBURG Thank you! Everything okay in there? Just a second. Hey! I'm Chen-Lu and I live here. Welcome. If you're hungry, I'm making spaghetti with homegrown mushrooms. Thanks. It tastes like Bolognese, not mushrooms. I'm glad to hear you say that, because it's one of my projects to integrate meat flavors into mushroom DNA. To make mass livestock farming obsolete. It's good for the environment and animals. I'm not vegetarian, nor do I have anything against people who are. I'm unbiased. I'm just into the idea, because I'm studying biology. How about you? -Medicine. -Awesome. If we get food poisoning, you can jump right in and save us. I have a weird laugh, it's a compliment that you're laughing. My parents used to make fun of me for it. Luckily, I don't have siblings, one-child policy. So, I only got bullied in school. It's our differences that make us unique, not what we have in common. Don't you think? Yeah. What about you? Do you have siblings? No. Okay, so I figure you know where you need to go tomorrow, but we can go together. The medical department is on the way to biology and that way I can show you around. Do you have a bike? See you at lunch in the cafeteria? Sure. -Okay. -Bye-bye. Bye! THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE Welcome to Freiburg. Take a moment to look around you. Say hello to your neighbors. You are studying medicine at one of best universities in Germany. You were the best in your class. Here, you're average. One in two of you will not make it to the preliminary exam. Hardly anyone will make it as far as the person you're all here to see. She is a doctor of medicine, a biologist, the youngest medical professor at a German university ever, entrepreneur, visionary. Professor Dr. med. h.c. Lorenz! Let's talk about the future. What is the future of medicine? Telemedicine and artificial intelligence. If that were the case, you'd be looking at a computer scientist, not a biologist. Gene therapy? And what's the basis for that? Synthetic biology. Synthetic biology. What is it? -Yes? -With the help of synthetic biology, we can change existing life forms or create new ones. Come on, people, think bigger! Synthetic biology turns us from creatures to creators. It's not just the future of medicine, but the future of mankind. We can prevent diseases before they break out. Provide equal opportunity beyond borders and social classes. Eradicate genetic disorders. Or all of mankind, if we don't do our jobs well. It is our responsibility to create the world of the future. Your responsibility. You are the creators of tomorrow. And what about God? Honestly? We will make God obsolete. Midazolam IV and set up an emergency CAT scan! Dr. Lorenz to the ER, please. Dr. Lorenz to the ER. Dr. Lorenz, please. My assistant Jasper will give you your assignment. Please research and present it tomorrow. He works for me, but I'll put him at your disposal for now. If you have any questions, he's the one to ask. The library will close shortly. Please proceed to the exit. Hey, stay here! Hello? Are you serious? Fuck! Hello? And who are you, little guy? He's mine. Shit! -Wait! -Stop! You can't let Mendel get away no matter what! Mendel? -The mouse! -Okay. Why is Mendel glowing? Maybe he's scared of the dark. And he's carrying a fluorescent protein gene inside of him. Did you synthesize it? -No. But I could have. -Then what are you doing with the mouse? I rescued him. Hero. Genetically modified animals have to be disposed of. And I've always wanted a pet. They didn't have a glow-in-the-dark husky, sadly. What's it like working for Lorenz? Very cool. I heard she sometimes also hires medical students to help with clinical trials. Yeah, sometimes. But only if you really impress her. -Are you coming... -You coming to... The freshmen party? Maybe. See you later then, right? Maybe. Hi! Hey. Is that interesting? It's not clear who the oligonucleotides get together with in the end, but I'll let you know what happens. There are way more interesting things you could be doing on your first night at college. -I know. -How reassuring. So, you're coming with me to the freshmen party? I have Lorenz's class tomorrow, I need to come up with an exciting idea. No. What you need is an exciting life! The right idea will present itself when it's needed! You guys see that deer over there? That's a stag. I know. I just wanted to test you. That's a squirrel! Are you guys screwing with me or do you really see something over there? Chlorine E8 solution. The stuff that helps deep-sea fish see in the dark. But you don't have to if you're too scared. Freak. Yeah. But it's cool. Hi. Hey. You did come. So did you. Am I blinding you? With your beauty? This is my roommate, Niklas. -Hi. -Hi. You have to read a lot, huh? Soft subject? Sociology. Of course. You just underline the important stuff, right? You're an expert on everything, right? See you later. Fuck. -Morning. -Morning! Bulletproof coffee? Hey, Ole? How much longer will these drops of yours last? Not much longer. That's what you said an hour ago. Yeah, okay. Could be that I was a bit clumsy with the pipette yesterday. Who's Charlotte, baroness of Fürstenberg? -The one faking it in there. -Nah, really? -Yeah, she's nobility. You knew that. -Yeah, but she's not faking it! -She is. -She is. Oh, my God! Okay. I'm going back to bed. Hey, don't you have Lorenz? Shit! Shit! Well, now she's awake. Genetically modifying a cell is the basis for creating new life. The first step is turning the cells fluorescent green. This is green, too. Other colors are more complicated, you'll learn that next year. This is green, too. And this. Very good. A coincidence? Gene synthesis. I don't like green. Mia. Last name? Akerlund. All right, Mia Akerlund. Carry on. Right, I see it here, too. Very nice. And here. Hey. -Hey. -Sorry again about yesterday. The last thing I can remember is that I puked on your roommate's shoes. -Don't worry, you only got me. -Well, that's a relief. Can I take you out for dinner tonight? Or a drink? Are you stalking me? Could be. Okay. 9:30 at Schlappen? Okay. What about this? -Something a little more laid-back? -Hang on. What's this? I did that when I was bored because I'd watched everything on Netflix after I'd found a Chrome extension that lets you watch at 1.5 times the speed. It's a bio-piano. I call it Bioano. Crazy. Hey, look. I did that with CRISPR, the gene tool that lets you do anything. Oh, God. I sound like Wikipedia again, sorry. But if you're interested... this is a great introductory read. I saw a mouse that had the same thing done to it. They've been doing that for years, but it doesn't make any sense at all. With plants it does. What about that one? I'm wearing it, you see that. Or are you experiencing after-effects from Ole's drops? That wouldn't be good. Please? Cool shirt. Thanks. What will it be? A beer, please. For you? Water, please. Thanks. Don't want to puke on my shoes, huh? I don't drink. Do you smoke? Any other weaknesses? None that I would reveal on a first date. Oh, so this is a date? Nice. And what about you? Do you have any secret vices? Oh, yes, but I'm just as mysterious as you, so... Oh, damn. You're studying medicine, but you're taking Lorenz's introductory biology course because you want a career like hers. You always worked really hard in school to get the best grades. You like to party, but then you pull yourself together and still go to class. You know more than other freshmen and like to show it. You also know that smart-asses don't have friends, so you fake modesty. You're a total over-achiever or else you wouldn't have become Lorenz's personal assistant. You sleep during class, which means that you're extremely good, otherwise she wouldn't let you get away with it. Or you're extremely tired because you party all night. But that contradicts the not drinking alcohol thing. -Yeah. -Shit. So, you are more mysterious than I am. What do you do at night? Are you Spider-Man? More like Iron Man, but... That means you fly around and battle against Captain America? Not exactly. But I... Oh, forget it. Okay. I have a small lab of my own. -No way. -I do. So, Lorenz lets you do whatever you want on campus? She lets me do what I want, but not on campus. Do I look like Pepper Potts? Or why should I believe you? Feel like taking a walk? Where are you taking me? Just wait. Scared? No. It's just so idyllic here. Welcome to my world. It's all stuff I bought from old labs or found on eBay. Should I put it on? That's only for the Al-Qaeda jobs that help me pay for all of this. So, what do you really do? I'm working on a gene vector. A modified virus that can transport DNA into human cells. Okay. Here, look. Imagine the cell is sick... because of faulty DNA due to a genetic disease or something. With the help of my gene vector, you can cut out the faulty part... and replace it with other, healthy DNA. Hasn't that been possible for a while now? In test tubes, yes. And you can do that for an adult body? Amazing. If you have a genetic disease, just give me a call. No, I've never been sick, not even the normal kind of sick, let alone genetically. You never know until you've been sequenced. I do the sequencing for Lorenz. I can squeeze you in, if you like. Nobody will notice. You don't even have my phone number and I'm supposed to give you my blueprint? You could start by giving me your cell phone number, if you like. Does that usually work? Telling freshmen you're Iron Man and then showing them your lab? Sometimes. I should go home now. Okay. I'll take you. No, it's fine. You carry on with CRISPR. I'll find my own way. If you want to become Lorenz's assistant, you'll have to fill out some forms. I'll send them to you, okay? If she's interested, she'll invite you for an interview. Thanks. LORENZ EXCELLENCE CENTER ONLINE APPLICATION - STUDENT ASSOCIATE Tomorrow at 9, you have your seminar at the university. At 11, a panel session, and the dean asked for a meeting-- I pay you so I don't have to think about the small stuff, Monique. Please just tell me what's next. Next is an interview with the Stanford Quarterly. -The journalist's been waiting two hours. -Bring him in. Dr. Andreas Winter. Andi. Tanja. Long time no see. You can go, Monique. Thanks. Okay. Take a seat. You're... a journalist? Yes. Shame. You were really good. Could have made something of yourself. You haven't changed. Not sure if that was a compliment or an insult, coming from you. A little of both, I think. My goals just... changed. But not because of... -Sandra? -Sarah. Well, you were always easy to please. What about you? Do you have family? Someone special? Kids? I've helped 8,000 childless couples have children. I think I've done my duty in that regard. I was always too busy to have my own. So, are you happy? It makes me happy when I make a discovery no one has made before. When I find new methods no one has ever explored. When my research heals thousands of people who otherwise would have died. So, yes. I am happy. Start recording, Dr. Winter. I've got a lot to do. Okay. Please continue with cardiac massage. Charging. Warning. Low battery. Number of shocks remaining: two. Please continue with cardiac massage. Charging. Warning. Low battery. Number of shocks remaining: two. Hello? What's your name? Mia? My name is Emma. Subtitle translation by Carina Chadwick
