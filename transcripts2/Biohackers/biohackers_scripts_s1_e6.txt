 Hello. What's your name? Mia? -Mia? -Niklas! Niklas. Niklas, stay with me. My name is Emma. Okay. Emma, can you tell us what happened here? Mommy! Is anyone here a doctor? Please, Emma. It's important.

 Can you tell me what happened here? My name is Petra Eller. I'm a doctor at the University Clinic Freiburg. Can you hear me? Emma? Do you understand me? Please, Emma, it's important. Fuck. What's the matter? I'm working on a gene vector. How do I insert a synthetic Coxsackievirus into a mosquito? And they have red eyes. That's standard for genetically modified life forms. Backup to carriage 23, please. Fuck. It has red eyes. It has red eyes.

 Backup to carriage 23, please. Fuck. Shit, shit, shit! Hey, Niklas. Shit! They have red eyes. Calm down, Emma, we have the situation under control. No, you don't! This is a modified mosquito. It spreads the Coxsackievirus. That's why everyone is having heart attack-like symptoms. They need to be taken to the hospital and stabilized right now. Backup to carriage 23, please! Listen to me! We need the right antibodies! Coxsackie, have you heard of it? -Do you have it? -We'll have to create it. How long will that take? A week or two, if we start from scratch. We don't have that much time! I could get some, just one dose, and we could amplify it. -How long will that take?! -Making one dose into 25? -That will take one hour at most. -Okay. Then I'll get the right antibody and you can amplify it. That's a very good plan, Emma. Acute psychotic episode. She doesn't seem to be lucid. No, we don't have any time! Listen to me! I'm telling the truth! Please, analyze that mosquito and take these people to the hospital. You have to believe me. Let me out! Fuck! Lorenz here. I want to report a break-in at my lab. Fuck. Come on. Hi, sweetie, good that you called. I have good news and bad news. -Which first? -Neither. Pass the phone to Chen-Lu. So, the good news is I've secured the funding for Jasper's Huntington's research. The bad news is, he'll have to go to Indonesia for it. Lotta. Chen-Lu, please. Anyway, maybe it's not so bad if Jasper goes to Indonesia. Now you and Niklas... Lotta! Chen-Lu! Now! Okay. Chenski. -I think Mia wants to speak to you. -Come on, pull over! Mia, you'll never guess what just happened. When I added a blue orchid to the Bioano... Stop. Stop! Stop! Asshole! Sorry, not you. Listen, Lorenz attacked a train. At least 20 people have been infected, -including Niklas. -Wait. What kind of attack? Check the news. You still there? Yes? I have no idea what Lorenz is planning. We need to get into Jasper's lab. To amplify the antibodies. Or all those people will die. Okay? Stop, please stop. Okay, I need you, Chen-Lu. Meet me at the lab. Is something wrong? PANIC AND INJURIES: TERRORIST ATTACK ON TRAIN TO BERLIN Crazy. That's not far from here. Why do you look so freaked out? Mia was on that train. What? My colleagues and employees are the only ones who know about my research, but I trust them implicitly. I can't imagine that one of them... No. We'll still need a list of all their names. -Crazy. -Yes. And she wants me to help her save those people by amplifying antibodies. What should I do? Well, look at it this way: Could you live with yourself if all these people die and you could have saved them, but didn't? Yep. Legal, illegal, whatever. I say we do it. Together. What? Yes. Show some support for your friends. Yeah, but what if we all get arrested? Then at least you'll have gained some followers. Okay. Jasper? You don't need that. Lorenz released your mosquitoes on a train. We need the antidote or everyone's going to die. No one's dying. We've got it all under control. "We"? You helped her? Have you totally lost your mind? You wanted to destroy our research and have Lorenz locked up. You don't give a fuck if I die. It's all your fault. My fault? Niklas and I have... Yeah, Niklas and you. It makes me sick. You never wanted me. You just used me to get close to Lorenz. And that's why you want to kill me and 20 others? Lorenz is creating the antibodies. The hell she is. Lorenz has no qualms about killing people. She has 200 children weighing on her conscience. She genetically modified my brother and me for her fucking experiments. She made us sick on purpose. And everyone died. Except me. That's total bullshit. Look it up. On her computer. Project "Homo Deus." And give me the antibodies. How fucking naive are you? Lorenz doesn't give a shit about you. She lets you do the dirty work, so she can keep her hands clean. And you're dumb enough to fall for it. Yeah? No! Yes? I have information about the train attack. I know the terrorist's location. Hey, there you are! Hey. -What's he doing here? -I don't really know either. -Helping. -You haven't started yet? This is all I have. -It's not very much. -Not enough? That's not what I said. Ole? Go find the bottle with the cell culture medium and bring it over here. Mia, you work on the cell culture. Lotta... you help Mia. -And Chen-Lu will amplify. -Petri dishes. This is the police. -We know you're inside. -Chen-Lu, carry on. -Come out with your hands up. -Oh, God. Oh, God. Come out with your hands up. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Jesus, Ole. Shut the fuck up! -Emma Engels, we know you're inside. -How much longer? One sec. -Come out with your hands up! -Shit, shit. -Done. -God, what do we do now? -Police, hands up. -I love you. Police! Hands up! No sudden movements. Turn around slowly. I am Emma Engels. You are under arrest. Do not resist. Put your head down. Calling headquarters. This is headquarters. The suspect has been arrested. Copy that. Operation complete. What did I miss? Do you have the antibodies ready? Come on in. Have you finished? I've started the process, all right? What happened? Mia was in my lab. She was trying to create the antibodies herself. But I destroyed the sample. Where is she now? I called the police. What did you do? It's best if the police arrest her as soon as possible. That was the plan, right? It's best if you stay here tonight. Help yourself to whatever you need. You know where everything is. UNIVERSITY OF FREIBURG MEDICAL CENTER You can't be in here. It's you. What you said on the train was right. I've analyzed the virus. It's a Coxsackie strain, like you said. Here are the antibodies. We need to administer them right now. They're from the same lab that the virus came from. It's the only way they'll survive. Please! You have to believe me! You can't be here. Write down your number. I'll call you if anything changes. WHAT HAPPENED? WHERE ARE YOU? CAN WE MEET IN FREIBURG? I HAVE THE DNA SAMPLES. GET IN TOUCH! GENERAL - REPORTS - LABS - CORRESPONDENCE LIST OF TEST SUBJECTS FILES TAKEN IN ON: DIED ON: TREATED BY: Jasper? You did not produce antibodies. We were never planning to save those people. I just don't get it. How could I have been so dumb as to trust you all this time? Please don't take it personally... but this is about something a bit bigger than your life. You trusted me because we're a good team. ...for coming. I have evidence that Emma Engels was not the perpetrator of this attack, but Jasper Wiesner. He's my closest colleague and confidant. I'd never have thought him capable of this. And do you know his current whereabouts? Yeah, hello? What? It almost seems like the virus was synthetically modified. I can't explain it. The antibodies should have worked, but there's nothing we can do. People, think bigger. Synthetic biology is not just the future of medicine, but the future of mankind. You want to get ahead, right? Then stop reproducing other people's methods. You need to invent your own. You experimented on embryos with genetic diseases. You crossed a line doing that. Don't mess with Lorenz. You intentionally made us sick? This kind of medicine isn't something for the university. It has to stay here. She didn't want the antibodies to work. She intentionally used a mutated virus! Red alert on four. -Fibrillation. -Prepare defibrillator. Three, two, one... -Again. -Three, two, one... Here. You can check it. Give me the right antibody, and I'll give you the rest of the DNA-samples. Emma. You're disappointing me. I thought you were smarter than that. We know each other well enough by now for you to know what matters to me. Okay. They're real. -Then give me the antibodies. -I haven't produced any. You're just going to let everyone die? Why? Nobody has to die. Not if we provide them with a better immune system. Come on. The new gene therapy. Homo Deus. You want to use that. So, that's what you wanted the entire time. Small-minded people may not believe it now, but in a decade, genetic optimization of humans will be the norm worldwide. They're all just guinea pigs to you. You can do whatever you like to them. Just like you did to my brother and me. I know you hold me responsible for the death of your brother, but he didn't die in vain. Think of all the people you can save because of him. Your choice, Emma Engels. I still need the DNA samples. I knew I could rely on your moral compass. Go to hell. Hey. How do you feel? How's the little girl? She's doing well. And you? How are you? I'm fine. You don't need to worry. Get some rest. See you later. Hey. Sweetie, you made it! Okay, guys. Enough, I'm going to cry. Oh, God. Right. I'll make a mushroom ragout and then we'll all have dinner. More importantly, let's all have a drink! I'll make us some cocktails. EMAIL TO: MIA AKERLUND MIA. YOU WERE RIGHT. J. LIST OF TEST SUBJECTS FILES {\an8}SAVE AS... COPY HOMO DEUS STUDY.ZIP I HAVE ALL THE EVIDENCE! MEET ME AT THE PARK. AT 6 O'CLOCK. Emma? So, we finally meet. I'm Andreas Winter. Hello. You look a lot like him. Like your father. I'm glad that you're continuing his work. Thanks. You said you have reliable evidence for everything you told me. This is all the data on the Homo Deus experiment. It's proof that no one died despite Lorenz's therapy, they died because of it. You need to make sure that woman never sets foot in a lab again. That she can never do what she did to me again. You can count on me. Subtitle translation by Carina Chadwick
