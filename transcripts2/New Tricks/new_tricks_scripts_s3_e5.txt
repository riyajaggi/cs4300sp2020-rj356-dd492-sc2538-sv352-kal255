 Morning, Jack. Gerry. Listening to Radio Four? Yeah! Out of ten reported crimes, two-and-a-half get detected, less get convicted. Even when you nick them, the CBS still find a reason not to prosecute. What's going on here? I don't know. Maybe they're tea leaves! Eh? Where is it?! Brian? BRIAN! What have you done with it?! Get him off! Brian! What's going on? I just said the whole place is being cleared, and he's gone berserk! Cleared?! Brian! Brian?

 One more step and you're a dead man! CRASH! Aghhhh! Oh, no no no, calm down! Just get in here and calm down! They looted it! They've bloody well looted it! What?! My desk! Three coloured pens, six rubber bands, a box of staples... and a Lonely Planet Guide to Latvia! What the hell is going on? Why have they shoved us in here?! You can't swing a cat! No, you can't breathe asbestos either. What? Asbestos. Our nice little office was riddled with it, apparently. Where are you going? You wouldn't like it. It's called work. So where would you like me to put this desk? No, take it easy, calm down! ♪ It's all right, it's OK ♪ Doesn't really matter if you're old and grey ♪ It's all right, I say it's OK

 ♪ Listen to what I say ♪ It's all right, doing fine ♪ Doesn't really matter if the sun don't shine ♪ It's all right, I say it's OK ♪ We're getting to the end of the day. ♪ OK. Craig Rossiter, 32. Murdered June 6th, 1996. Almost ten years to the day. No murder weapon found, no struggle, no sign of anybody else present. Body was found here? Yeah, close to the trunk. Dry. No rain. The surrounding area was completely undisturbed. The post-mortem indicates that he died where he lay, from a single blow to the head. And no sign anywhere of the killer's presence? No. Maybe he fell out of the tree? It's a nice idea, but the position of the body and the post-mortem prove that he didn't fall from any height. It's a mystery. What was he? He was a librarian in Acton and - this is the other weird thing - that was the only information on Rossiter that the murder team could find. Nothing else was known about him. Until now. According to new information, he was also... He was a witch. He was a what? Witch. Hello, Sarah, thanks for coming. Hello. Hi, I'm Grace Woodford. I have a degree in biochemistry, and I suffer from clinical depression. Sarah's my analyst and she used to be Sandra's, which is why we're all here. Is that about right? Grace has been coming to see me for several years now. And...well, we're at a point where we want to establish whether what she's saying about murder and witchcraft... Is true. ..is real. Perhaps you should tell us what you know. When I was young, I got involved in Wicca, the craft - witchcraft. I was a member of a coven based in West London. I'd been with the coven for about four years when, in 1996, one of the members of the coven was killed. Murdered. Craig Rossiter. And you saw it? No. At least... You were there when it happened? Erm... OK...so I have blanks in my memory. But whatever it was that happened, it scared me so much that I... Grace had a sort of breakdown. Not a sort of one, I went out of my mind! So you don't know, or rather you can't remember who was responsible? I stopped being involved. I know at the time no-one ever spoke to us about it. The police never spoke to any of you? Anyone in the coven? Grace, could you let us have names of any of the other members? Yes. I remembered these. I wrote them down, three of them. So that's a start, right? Thank you. Bye. Bye bye. I've worked out how the body got there. How it was done. Oh, yeah? It's magic! Look, it's on file and it's unsolved. It won't take us long to work out if Grace is telling us the truth or... She's just bonkers. Ill. You can make a start by tracking down that lot. Three witches? Shouldn't be too hard. These days, they're probably on e-mail. He doesn't get many visitors, hardly at all now. Alex Hackett? I'm from UCOS, the Metropolitan Police's Unsolved Crime... Sorry, he can't understand you. He has Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's? How old is he? Fifty-five. I didn't know you could get it that early. He had a stroke when he was 48, which they think triggered the onset of the illness. I've looked after him for the past five years. He's quite helpless. So you were previously in charge of the investigation? Rossiter? Aye. Loner the Librarian. I was just a DI back then. It was a complete arse of a case. Yeah, I got that from the file. Single. Lived alone. 33. 32. No friends to speak of, except work colleagues. Oh, he had a mother who was an alcoholic. My guess is she's dead by now. She is. Now, you suggest in your notes that Rossiter was gay. Well, it was the only motive we could go with. Mostly because of where he was found. The Royal Parks Police said it was a gay pick-up area. And he had no girlfriends. No-one else seemed to know him. No weapon, no forensic. Body was left out. Grace, the people whose names you gave us are no longer around. Hackett has Alzheimer's, and the others are dead. I know. You know?! It was a test. Is that meant to be funny? No, it's meant to be real. Sorry about this. OK. There were others in the coven, weren't there? You know more names? Grace, this is not a game. No, it's not, but you never believed me. Rhoda Wishaw and Cara Nabb. They were the high priestesses. They're still around and still fully compos mentis, unlike some of us. Cara sticks pins in people. Can't be that hard to find. Excuse me, but... what do you really want? I want to find out what happened, what really happened. Because I can't remember. And...it's driving me out of my mind. Thank you. You're welcome. Cheers. Cara. Cara Nabb. Thank you for seeing us. We're currently re-investigating the murder of Craig Rossiter. I understand you knew him. I have a patient in ten minutes. He was in your coven, supposedly. You ARE a witch? I'm an acupuncturist. Are you saying you're not a witch anymore? Isn't that like asking a man if he still beats his wife? I don't know, I'm not married. No, but you were. More than once. Yes, I was. I am, and he was. Yet you never told the police about this at the time. About Rossiter's involvement with the craft. No. Why not? In 1969, a woman who worshipped along similar lines had her lifestyle exposed in the pages of a certain Sunday newspaper. It destroyed her life, that of her husband and their eldest son. That was in 1969. That was my mother. I've always felt this day might come and I've always dreaded it. But contrary to your belief... I do not think that the world has changed. If he was in your coven, surely you would want to know who killed him and why? Unlike the police, I'm quite used to handing myself over to the acceptance of mystery. Unless you are a believer, you wouldn't understand. Craig was an enthusiastic participant, but his death had nothing to do with his being a white witch. Then what was it to do with? I don't know. As I said, it's a mystery. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must prepare for my patient. Thank you. Good afternoon. I'm Jack Halford, this is Brian Lane. We're from UCOS. We phoned. Oh...yes. We're looking into the murder of one of your colleagues. Craig Rossiter. It was about ten years ago. Would you remember him? No. No, I wasn't here then. I wonder...do you have an occult section here? They've not been taken out much, have they? Yeah, well, what call is there for a spell to release fairies from your psychic halo? Huh! Apart from then, the year Rossiter died. Ah! Excuse me? Yes? Would you be able to tell me who borrowed these just from these dates? Absolutely not. We don't divulge that kind of information. It's a secret, is it? No. It's illegal. Ah. The Data Protection Act. Yes. Well, no actually, there are certain provisions under the Act which permit access to specific material if there's a public interest in that information's disclosure. No. I've been expecting you. Thank you. Thank you, Jonathan. Mr Standing. Oh, I'm sorry. You wanted to see me. Here I am. I'm looking for... Inner peace. Why have all your relationships failed, do you think? I'm sorry? My guess is that although you like to think you revel in women's company, in reality, in the long run, we're just a bit too, well...scary. Hm? Rhoda Wishaw. Where is she? Rhoda? Yes, you should meet Rhoda. She'd like you. Really? In the 2001 census, she was of no fixed abode. No, well, she wouldn't be. So where is she? This time of year, your best bet is between Lewes and the Weald. Look high up. Don't worry, you won't miss her. Thank you. "The Green Man, also known as Jack in the Green, is a common figure in folklore. "A tree-like symbol of power and fertility, he is also represented in carvings featured in architecture, "more correctly known as foliate heads..." You wanted to show me something? Remind you of anyone? Anyone you know? He died under a tree. The leaves could've just fallen on him. This is the painting from Alex Hackett's house, The Green Man. Uncannily like the tree Rossiter died under. Talking of which, guess whose garden backs onto Richmond Park? Very nice. Your own private gateway to Richmond Park. There's been a house here since before it was a park. Before it was a royal estate even. Beautiful garden. I must say you all seem terribly keen on talking to me, which is surprising, given your scepticism about the craft. There are so few members of your coven left. Plus the fact that this house overlooks the place where Rossiter died. It seems to be a very unlucky coven. I didn't think the police believed in such insubstantial elements as luck. We don't. And I don't believe that Craig Rossiter... was magicked to death either. I think somebody was responsible. And not just Rossiter. That night ruined Grace Woodford's life as well. So, were YOU responsible? Of course not. Many plants have special properties, you know. Magic? Healing. I could blend some together in a way that could help you, for example. Me? Your deep melancholy. Your sense of loss... and loneliness. Your pain, confusion... ..your hurt, your anger. You also share these feelings - lonely... separate, isolated. You also use work to camouflage the void. You need... we all need... ..love. Tell Grace I'm sorry. I realise how painful this must be for her...for all of us. Rossiter was a witch, and you're right, all this stuff is linked - Hackett's stroke, all the other deaths, Grace's breakdown, poor thing. What happened? What did she see? Jack? What is it? Jack? Are you in there? ..Jack? Jack?! What is it? What's happened? I don't know. I had a...panic-attack, I think. Come on. How come it's so warm out here and so bleeding cold in that car? How come I don't make you walk back? Gerry. Brian, I'm not feeling good about this. Come on. I don't do trees! This is a clearing. There's trees everywhere. Look at the bleeding things! FAINT SINGING Aaagh! Ohh! Ohh! Aggh! Oh, my shoulder! Oh! Oh... It was your fault, you dopey sod! Oh... Agh! Well, it's been a long time since I had two men fall for me! Oh... Ooh! Agh! You should be more careful, especially at your age. What d'you mean, at my age? Ow! You can't expect him not to try to protect himself. Who? The spirit of the woods. Would you, er...dry my hair... while I carry on doing this? Isn't it a bit... dangerous? A woman, alone in the woods? SHE CHUCKLES How long have you...? Lived in a tent? Years... I'd die inside four walls. Craig Rossiter. Remember him? Oh, I see. You want to talk about shadows. Craig. Yeah. Sad. Murder's more than sad. Thank you. Agh. Erm...what's in this? Well...there are about 26 different ingredients. But don't worry, none of them are poisonous. It's a restorative. Mmmm, nice. Now, you knew Craig Rossiter? He was a witch just like you. A warlock. A searcher. I never thought he was on the right path for finding it. Finding what? Whatever it was that he was looking for. You were in a coven with Cara Nabb. All the other members are either dead...or deranged. What, you think they were put under some kind of a spell? Yeah, well, Rossiter wasn't. He was put under some heavy blunt instrument. How's your arm? It'll be even better by tonight. Yeah. Do you think anyone in the coven could have killed Rossiter? Neither could nor would. That violates the most sacred Wicca tenet. Which is? Harm none. Harm none. That is the whole of the law. Just out of interest... where were you on the night he died? Do you remember? June 6th 1996? Yes, oh, yes. I was with the wind... ..and amid the stars. Oh, yeah? Was that near Richmond Park? Here you go. And another thing, her away-with-the-fairies act doesn't fool me. She knows plenty. We'll talk about that tomorrow. I'm sorry I can't invite you in. No problem, mate. I've got to be somewhere. Ta-ta! Oh, hello. What's the matter with you? Erm... Come here. What? What the hell are you doing here? Hello, Alison. What's all this about? I'll show you what it's all about. Oh...! Brian, I'm in the middle of... Come on... What? HE HUMS Ooh! HE CARRIES ON HUMMING ESTHER SHRIEKS Brian! I never thought I'd hear you use the words panic attack. Are you sure you're OK? I'll be all right. Don't worry. I'll see you in the morning. Night night. Night. Did you? Did you see them? What are you doing here?! You did, didn't you? You spoke to Cara and Rhoda. Grace, you shouldn't be here. I can't talk to you without Sarah present. Do they exist? They are real? Yeah. And what did they say? Did they say it was me? Did they, did they say it was me? Cara Nabb said that she was very sorry about what had happened. And about how painful it has been for you. She said that? Well? Was it you? Was it you who killed Rossiter? Grace, why have you waited so long to say anything? To get help? I didn't wait. What do you mean? I didn't wait. I went to Dr Hart. Who's that, another analyst? No. No, he's not an analyst. Why did you go and see him then? Grace? Morning. Morning. I can't find Grace anywhere. I saw her yesterday but she seems to have disappeared. Have you tried Sarah? Yes, no answer. I've left a message. Oh...blimey. Am I keeping you up? Only just. Rhoda Wishaw. How was she? Yeah, I think we should talk to her again. Definitely. What did she say? Er... She was very vague. Yeah, vague. Secretive. A suspect? Oh, absolutely! Yeah, I think we should put her on the spot, right now. Hang on. Yeah, Hart. Any Dr Hart. Nothing? Ohh... OK, no, that's fine. All right, thanks, bye. So where's Jack...? Magic. You saw this? In somebody's house. It's a symbolic figure. The Green Man. Yes, that's right. I dreamed about him. I was trying to run away and he scooped me up in his arms, I suppose, and held me in the air. And that frightened you? No. Just the opposite. I felt quite peaceful. First time for a long time. And then...I saw this...on a house. And after that, I saw my wife. Mary? Yes. But she's dead. She was real. And that frightened you? Yes. The Green Man. A very ancient image. He's a symbol of regeneration. And fertility. Yes, I know. In dreams, sometimes he... Seen before death, yes, I looked it up. Not necessarily. He also presages rebirth. Renewal. The triumph of spring over winter. Did Grace ever see him? Did she ever mention the Green Man in her sessions with you? Did she ever show you any pictures like that? I'm sorry, I can't discuss details of one patient with another. It's unethical. Let's talk about me then. Am I unwell or am I just going totally insane? I see. In that case, how do I stop seeing my dead wife? DOORBELL I'm sorry, excuse me. Oh, hi! Sarah, I'm really worried about Grace. I've been looking for her. Can I come in? I need to ask you something. I'm with a patient. Oh, sorry. Quickly then, who's Dr Hart, and why was Grace going to see him? Sandra, I'm bound by a code of confidentiality between Grace and I. I can't possibly tell you. Sarah, this is a murder enquiry. I've left a cheque. Can you give me a lift? I don't feel like driving. I wish you'd told me before you went to see Sarah. What? That I keep seeing Mary - it's either a witch's spell or I've gone completely bonkers? You know me better than that. I wouldn't keep anybody in this job five minutes if they told me that. Well, do you want to know about Dr Hart or not? Absolutely! Emmanuel Hart is a Doctor of Divinity. He lectures in theology at the University of London. How do you know so much? Magic. It's not just a case of uttering a few well-chosen phrases and... But I can't bear it any more! You have to give it to me, there's only one day left, for God's sake! Give it to me! Grace? Give what to you? Don't come near me. Stay away. Do you understand? Dr Hart? Did you sleep all right last night? Well, not a lot. You? On and off. Esther? Very restless. You boys are keen, aren't you? Are you on the move again? Oh, I like to keep on the move. Anything prompt it? The moon. When we were here yesterday, we put a series of questions to you. You didn't answer them fully. Didn't I? Grace Woodford. Well, no, you didn't ask me about her. Have you seen her recently? No, not in years sadly. I liked her very much. She's disappeared. Do you think Cara might know where she is? Well, I don't know, ask her. Ah, tea time. Magic is not all about making tea. No, so I've been reading. A lot of it is about sex, isn't it? Seems to be a very powerful aspect of magic. It's a powerful tool in the hands of those who know what they're doing. Did Rossiter know what he was doing? Is that why he was killed? Magic is strong and frightening. It can do great damage... and yet great good. Drinks? Thank you! It's a bit bitter. From midst the fountains of delights rises something bitter. Exorcism? The Church of England has long retained the post of an official exorcist. But you didn't carry one out. Why? You'd be surprised how many even seemingly rational individuals are convinced they are tormented by demons. Had congress with assorted succubi and incubi, the devil even. Congress? Sex. Is this what Grace believes? I couldn't find her, she's gone. What did she mean, "one day left"? I've no idea. Often these things are unfathomable except to the person concerned. So what did you do, back then? I enlisted the help of a decent analyst. Sarah Ellington. How can you be sure that Grace isn't tormented by demons? Oh, I believe Grace witnessed, probably even took part in something terrifying... Took part? Oh, yes. Once I'd arranged psychiatric help for Grace, I urged her to go to the police. Sarah agreed. When was this? Six, seven years ago. Ahh! BRIAN GASPS IN TERROR Brian. It's all right, mate, it's all right. It's all right. You gave Grace a message from one of these women?! If you had no idea of how dangerous it was then, perhaps you do now! More dangerous than waiting seven years to inform the police about a murder? Dr Hart told us that not only was Grace there when Rossiter was killed, she may even have taken part! Now you knew about this yet you chose to say nothing. Why? I have to judge what is in the best interest of my patient. Grace wasn't ready. So vital time and evidence has been lost. Now Grace has disappeared and the killer's still out there. That's just solely down to you! PHONE RINGS Excuse me. Pullman. Hi, Esther. They're out here. Brian, Jack and Sandra are here. Ssh! He won't let me get the doctor. Here, it's here, I've got it! Listen. "From midst the fountain of delights rises something bitter that chokes them all among the flowers..." Bitter? It was bitter! Lucretius. Roman poet and philosopher. He was said to have died mad from the effects of a love potion. given to him by his wife Lucilia. A love potion? Ah, now, we had tea. We had some tea and then... And then today... Today? You went to see Rhoda again? She's poisoned them. Drugged. Witchcraft. She made us forget. Like Grace. They want to scare us. Even Grace, remember? "Stay away from me. It's the coven." We have to find out what it is... and what it does. The coven's disbanded. Is it? Why? Because Cara and Rhoda say it is? Because Grace says it is? I don't think so. You're not here to see Mr Hackett? No. I'm here to see this. Strange, isn't it? I often wonder what it's supposed to mean. It means that sometimes you can't see the wood for the trees. DOORBELL What do you want? Warlock! Eh? Rhoda called Rossiter a warlock, not a witch. D'you know what warlock means, literally? And d'you know what the time is, literally?! Oath breaker. A breaker of his word. Now listen to this. Look, d'you want a drink? Yeah, a glass of water. This is a list of book titles borrowed by Rossiter the year he died. But not from Bravington. Through the inter-library lending service. Now listen. Satan And His Place In Your Life. A Voyage To The Dark Side And Back Again. Now remember what Cara Nabb said to Jack? About Rossiter's dying was nothing to do with him being a white witch? Well, no, of course not, because they're not white witches. They're black! He got hold of every satanic text he could find in the twelve months before he died. But if they were all black witches, why kill one of their own? Well, maybe it's the 666 thing? The what? You know, Book Of Revelation. The mark of the Beast. The Beast, Aleister Crowley. They kill one of their own on the sixth day of the sixth month, 1996. It's like that film, The Wicker Man. Did you ever see it? Yeah, yeah. Edward Woodward. They burn him alive. Yeah, because in the film he's a virgin. As of midnight tonight, it's the 6th of June 2006 - 6.6.6. Ten years to the day since Rossiter died. Grace. Yeah, and I bet you any money she's a virgin. Jack. Jack? I wouldn't have thought so. No, no, in the film, Edward Woodward is a policeman. MOBILE RINGS No. Still no answer. It's 11.20. We've got 40 minutes. Come on, I'll organise back up. I believe this is an example of breaking and entering. Well, entering really. So, tell me about the cult of The Green Man. Or should I say, Jack in the Green? No. We call him Green George. A thousand-year-old tree, maybe more. A place of worship, probably three times as old. A line of worshippers stretching back unbroken. We are not a cult. It's a system of spiritual belief. It's dedicated to good, to love. I see. Is that why you have a picture of the devil downstairs? That picture is of Cernunnous, the Horned God. He predates Christ by about 2,000 years. Really? Well, I don't think yours is an order dedicated to love. I think it's a cult of death. I don't know how or why, but I think Craig Rossiter was lured into it for one reason only. To be murdered. - Cara, we have to hurry. - Agh! Ten to midnight and I'm stomping through a bloody great wood by moonlight! Shut your moaning. There's not enough trees for your blooming hydrophobia... Hylophobia. Hydrophobia's mad dog disease. I know what I said. Ssh! CHANTING Worship him, worship her... OK, so what now? I don't know. We just wait. Where the hell's Jack? Ssh, listen. What's that? It's Grace. They're going to kill her. They're going to bloody sacrifice her! Lord and lady, always one. What are we going to do? RADIO: 'We're in position.' The boys are here. Come on, let's go. Where's Jack? Where is he? Where's Grace? Wherever she is, she's not going to be sacrificed by you lot. Are you insane? Is that what you think we do? Rhoda! Oh, Cara, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. The hour is past, the spell is broken. We're too late. We're too late. CARA SOBS You've ruined it. You've ruined everything. Grace?! Grace! He said he loved me. He told me... He promised me love. Amazing...incredible love. Rossiter? He's the devil. You see him? You see him, don't you? You see Rossiter, he appears to you. Have you always seen him ever since he died? Yes... Why, do you see him? No, not him. Someone else. Have you told anyone about this? No, never. Until now. What about now? Do you see him now? No. No, he's gone. Is...? No, she's gone. We came together again, tonight. Green George, in the Green. To lift the curse, his curse. It's all right, he's gone. Yeah, I know. I remember. I killed him. Rossiter was extraordinarily charismatic. Within a year of joining us, he had used this power to prey on us. Prey? Sexually. Including Grace, who believed she'd had sex with the devil. Grace was the final straw. To abuse one so young? We realised then, in order to protect ourselves, we had to... Kill him. We all struggled with him and in that struggle, he died. We never meant to kill him, but in doing so, in this sacred place... we defiled our own shrine and we were cursed. Cursed? Rhoda managed to mitigate the effects. But even her gifts fell short of fully protecting the rest of us. You look pretty good on it. I have cancer. MOBILE RINGS Pullman. 6.6.6. That's a satanic date. No! It is only on this date and at that special hour that the moon and stars were in alignment. But you stopped us, and so we have failed. OK, thanks. Your house is empty. So, last chance. Where's Jack Halford? He's up here. Jack?! How d'you get up there? I walked, from that tree to this tree. Same as they did. We are one, one with the green. Betwixt and between. Unseen. Magical. WIND ROARS What happened to your neck? It's Cara's handiwork...or should I say this. That's a tayzo. They're banned in 27 countries. They should be. It bloody hurt. He died up there. The PM shows he couldn't have done. He didn't fall. That's right, he didn't. He was killed up there and he was lowered by them, very carefully. They could leave this tree, arrive and leave, without leaving any trace. Correct? And you all just sat there. And watched as I killed Craig. You? No, no, no. You didn't do it, Grace! Yes, I did. It was me. Grace, I'm dying. You saw Craig die, but you didn't kill him. I killed him, do you understand? Whatever you think happened here, I take sole responsibility. I killed Craig Rossiter. OK, cheers. Well? What do you think? Should we let Cara take the blame? Sounds about right. It makes sense. No, I believe her.
