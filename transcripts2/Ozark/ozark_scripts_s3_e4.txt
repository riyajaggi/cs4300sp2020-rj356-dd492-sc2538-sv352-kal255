 - What the fuck are you doing? - Calling the cops. Stop! Don't! Who the hell are those people? Ask your fucking sister. I'm telling you, I had nothing to do with this. - You wouldn't tell me if you did. - I didn't do this. But I was afraid it would happen. I only saw the one who pointed the gun at me. Uh, there were four. Uh, the driver, and the three who threw Marty in the backseat. - And the man in charge. Describe him. - Um...

 Little guy. Uh, he had mean eyes, uh, and balding, balding. Shit. I wanted to keep you out of this. - Because I'm a fuck-up? - No, because it's dangerous. You need to tell me what the fuck is going on! - I can't. - Wendy... I can't. This is really serious. These people are very dangerous. Yeah, yeah, I know. I know they're fucking dangerous! I think you'd better get here as soon as possible. Things are getting complicated. I work for a Mexican drug cartel. What? Fuck! Fuck!

 Fuck. Don't tell me you can't call Navarro. I know you can. I'm not saying that I can't. I'm saying that I don't think it's advisable. You never know how he's gonna react. Where did you get that number? It's disconnected. When was the last time you used it? - Yesterday. - And how was his mood then? - It was fine. - Oh. What do we do now? We wait. Who's that? ¿Quién es ese? Just... I'm executing the plan. And it's a good plan, it's yours. I mean, I... I understand that... that we haven't been laundering to your satisfaction, but we've been under constant pressure from the FBI. It's just... you know, it's not safe, and, um... You know, the last... last three weeks, we've been able to launder... a significant amount of money. And this... this last week, six figures. We funneled it through, uh... an REO Speedwagon concert. What do you want, Marty? I don't understand the question. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I don't know if I... can run things without Marty. I mean, he... he does shit that... that I don't know how to do. Do you know how to do this? Hi. Sorry we're so late. I had to drop off Erin first. My allergies are acting up. Okay. Thank you for including Erin. Yeah, of course. She's great. How was the lake? It was fucking awesome. Where's Dad? He had business in... Kansas City. Wasn't on the schedule. Came up at the very last second. You guys should get to bed. Night. Hey, did... did Mom just lie to us? Yeah. Something bad's going on. I should get home. If there's no news by morning, you should start thinking about what you're gonna say to the kids. Hello? Hey! Can I help you? You're Ruth Langmore. Maya Miller. Have you seen Marty? He was supposed to meet me here. Marty's out of town, but I'll be covering for him while he's gone. Out of town where? Kansas City. He didn't mention that to me. I guess we better get to it. Oh. Morning. - Is Dad okay? - Have you heard from the cartel? I... I don't know what you've heard... but... your father just went down to Mexico. Was he kidnapped? He went down to Mexico to talk to our boss. He's fine. He'll be home soon. How do you know that? Because that's the plan. And that's how these things work. I'm sure we'll hear from him very soon. You got a sec? What the fuck were you thinking? What the fuck were you thinking? They know so much. Yeah, I know what they know. It's my concern, and it is not yours. Shit, Wen. Bad enough what you're getting into, - but bringing your kids into it? - This is not your fucking problem. Deal with your own shit before you dive into mine. My shit is your shit right now. How'd they take the news? Better than I did. They're kind of grown up now. It's... weird. Jesus. You're in some shit. Mom. Helen Pierce is here. Marty's alive. I'm afraid that's about all I could get out of him. Um, I still haven't spoken to my client. Have you? Mnh-mnh. Who called you? Jorge Mendoza. Uh, your brother's "little man with the mean eyes." This Mendoza wouldn't call just to tell us how Marty's doing. No. He called with a message. From above, I presume. "Business as usual." Oh... he's testing us. Yeah, and if we succeed... well, it could mean that Marty is, um... redundant. And if we fail? Well, I'm afraid we might be. ♪ Ninety-nine bottles Of beer on the wall ♪ ♪ Ninety-nine bottles of beer ♪ ♪ Take one down, pass it around ♪ ♪ Ninety-eight bottles of beer On the wall ♪ ♪ Ninety-eight bottles of beer On the wall ♪ ♪ Ninety-eight bottles of beer ♪ ♪ Take one down, pass it around ♪ ♪ Ninety-seven bottles of beer On the wall ♪ ♪ Ninety-six bottles of beer on the wall ♪ ♪ Ninety-six bottles of beer ♪ ♪ Take one down, pass it around ♪ ♪ Ninety-five bottles of beer On the wall ♪ ♪ Ninety-five bottles of beer On the wall ♪ ♪ Ninety-five bottles of beer ♪ ♪ Take one down, pass it around ♪ - ♪ Ninety-four bottles... ♪ - Marty. That's not helping, okay? Sorry, Mom. Why don't you go down the hall and get yourself a snack, okay? Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh! It's all yours, kid. Good luck. Do you love her? Yeah. Do you trust her? I do. Then why do you spy on her? Why do you listen to her phone calls? Just to protect her. From me? You fear her. Yeah. Yeah, you fear her because you don't understand her. And you do? Wendy knows exactly what she wants. And what's that? All of it. She wants it all. So... what do you want? I want to see her again. And I want to see my kids again. "I want to see my wife and kids again." You're a liar, Marty. Hmm? You lie... to your wife. You lie to me. And you lie to yourself. So... please... again. What... do you want? Each one of you gets nine grand a day. It's nine for a reason. Over ten gets reported. Exchange your cash for chips, you know, lose a few hands at the game of your choice, and then cash out your cut, one grand each. You dumb-asses got it? If there's one thing I can do well, boss, it's lose at cards. Now, guys like you coming in with wads of cash gets noticed. So, y'all need to have a story. For instance: "Oh, well, I won it playing bingo at the VFW," or "Old Auntie Dipshit just left me a whole bundle and she dropped dead" and yada yada. I don't care what your fucking story is, but you better fucking have one ready. And don't go buying any outboard motors. Not until next month. Are we clear? One second. All good? All good. I thought you told them to wear their Sunday best. Well, you're looking at it. No. We need folks we can trust. What, you telling me you can't trust your own brother? I don't want him in this. We need bodies. Look, I'll keep my eye on him. I promise. All right! Y'all get in a fucking line. These just came in for you to sign. Oh, just add them to the pile. Uh, Charlotte? I know how worried you are about your Dad. If there's anything I can do... Thanks. How much do you know? Everything? Erin must never know. There will be consequences for anyone who speaks truth to my daughter. Do you understand? I understand. And? So far, so good. Ruth's got a team in place. And you're sure that she's up to it? Ruth? Oh, I trust her. Based on what? Based on the fact that Marty trusts her, and she's devoted to him. And what if she's not devoted enough? Cross that bridge if we come to it. All right, bet's closed. Nineteen red. - Sorry, folks. - Oh. - And the dealer has a queen. - Agh! - Sorry, folks. - Oh, hell. I'm out. Sixteen. - Bust. Sorry, sir. - Ahh! - Hi there. - Hi. I already fed him. He looked hungry. Thank you. Yeah, we're all about compliance here at the Missouri Belle. On that note, do you have... Last night's take as well as midday counts from the last hour. Thank you. So Marty's out of town. Yep. Where again? Kansas City. You hear from him? No. Hmm. What? There's a spike in this morning's numbers compared to yesterday's. Oh, it's summer. Lake's always crazy busy in the summer. You'd think so, but... foot traffic appears to be roughly the same. In fact, there were 5% fewer gamblers on the floor this morning. Well, a lot of rich folks come here for the summer. And rich folks love to gamble, and they got the cash to do it. I'm gonna walk the floor. - I'll come with you. - Not necessary. You're Ben Davis. Wendy Byrde's brother. When were you gonna show me your badge? Well, I considered this a casual conversation. You don't strike me as a casual person. All right then, on the record... What are you doing here? Gambling. It's a casino. Your sister's casino. Kind of a win-win, wouldn't you say? What do you do for a living? Substitute teacher. I didn't know that paid so well. Pays for shit. I got a rich sister. Your brother-in-law still out sick? He's not sick. He's in Kansas City. Hmm. Excuse me. I'm gonna have to ask you not to disturb the players. I'll see you tomorrow. And the next day. And the next. Ooh. Ooh! Marty. It's, like, totally fixed. I watched this guy, number one on the leaderboard. I mean, his game play is awesome. And the only way he could keep winning was to drop more quarters. Can you believe that? You can't just get good enough and play through on one quarter. The only way you can win is if you've got enough money... God damn it, Marty, we don't have enough money for food, let alone arcade games! What the fuck do you want? Tell me what you want. All right, I got a question for you. You want to break me? Is that what you want? You want me to tell you the truth? You want me to confess? I don't trust my wife, and I fear you. You scare the fucking shit out of me. The both of you do, with your fucking plans about a legitimate casino. I've been against that since day one. And you want to know what else? I'm rooting for the other guy. I pray to God you lose your war, and they chop your fucking head off. - That's a start. - What? Fuck you! Hi. Oh, thank you. Oh, God, thank you. What? - What is it? Spit it out. - Um... Um, it's about Helen. She knows that I know about Dad. And I'm... I'm really sorry. I meant to keep it all a secret. Oh, it's all right. You wouldn't be the first person to be outfoxed by Helen Pierce, so do not... do not beat yourself up. You know, there are times when you, you just have to say to yourself... "I fucked up," and then... and then you have to move on. God knows I have, more than you ever will. Do you know this man? No. His name is Jorge Mendoza. He's a known operative for the Navarro drug cartel. He was in the crowd the night Marty disappeared. Marty's in Kansas City. When was the last time you spoke with him? The other night. Well... We had a little fight. We haven't spoken since. So then you can't say for certain he's in Kansas City. I suppose I can't. Wendy, it's my opinion and that of the Bureau, for that matter, that your husband is in grave danger. Go on. We think Mendoza abducted Marty that night. Took him to Mexico on a private jet. That's the cartel's MO. They're most likely torturing him. Maybe it's a loyalty test. Navarro's in the middle of a big war. There's a lot of tension down there. Whatever the reason... I'm sorry to say, I'm not sure if you'll see your husband again. Then what is it you think you can do for me? If a cartel kidnaps an American citizen on US soil, we have cause to act on Mexican soil. We can go after him. We can go after Omar Navarro. Marty's in Kansas City on business. When he's done, he'll come home. Call me. Anytime. Day or night. I can help. Please stop! Ruth? I don't... I... I don't fucking understand. It's the Panama accounts. - There's never been a fucking problem. - Tell us exactly what happened. You were doing your daily bank transfers and... Yes, like I've been doing every fucking day without a red fucking flag. - Why this account? - I don't fucking know! I don't know! - What the fuck is a red flag anyway? - It means that the account's frozen 'cause the feds might think that there's a crime being committed. - Like by me. - You said you could handle things... I did what he taught me. It's not my fucking fault! - Can you fix this? Can you fix it? - Her best is gonna get us all killed. I don't know how! When will Navarro know? When the banks open in the morning. - What happens now? - I don't know. You ever get the call about me... you'd let me know. Yes. Hey. Hey. I thought I ought to come check on you. I'm okay. You know, you should probably get out of town. That's what my sister said. And her husband. Yeah. Things are gonna get ugly here. "Ugly" is my middle name. Actually, it's Jude. After St. Jude... patron saint of hopeless cases. Thanks, Mom and Dad. I'm, uh... I'm sorry my family put you in their world of shit. I was in a world of shit long before I met them. Well, I'm still sorry. And I'm not going anywhere until I know you're safe. See you tomorrow, Jude. Where is my money? - You made them launder without me. - Yes. And now you need to fix it. You have a red flag on a Panamanian deposit account. That happens. All you have to do is you have to... clone the frozen assets, using a pre-authorized access code. And then, you have to redirect the deposit history in order to hide... the inter-bank transfer. You change the passcode twice so that you circumvent the automated security checks. And then you're done. Get up. Get up. No, I did it. I did it! I did it, you fuck! I just fucking did it! I did it, motherfucker! I fixed it! I won, motherfucker! Hey! Look at me, fuckhead! Hey! - Hi. - I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't want to disturb you. It's all right. - Don't stay up too late. - I won't. Are you okay? Yeah. - Good night. - Night. Wen... Hey. Shh. I know what I want. What is that? I want to launder only when I say that it's safe. And when's that gonna be? When I compromise an FBI agent. "Compromise." I'll turn her. In a matter of months, she's gonna be working for me. And then we're all safe. And is that it? Is that all you want, Marty? How about you thank me? How about you say thank you to me? Can you do that?
