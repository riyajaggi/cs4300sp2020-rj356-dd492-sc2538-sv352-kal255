 I barely knew those guys. I saw them once a week, tops. How often did Marty interact with them? Don't answer that. If you have questions for Marty Byrde, you can ask him this afternoon. Keep in mind, we're here voluntarily. What about Frank Cosgrove Jr.? I imagine you dealt with him with some regularity. Is there any animosity between you two? No. We don't work together that much.

 Well, that's not true, is it? I see you two on the casino floor all the time. You don't seem too friendly. We coordinate deliveries for the casino. That's all. If that's the case, maybe you can explain why we found the truck 100 miles across the state when it was scheduled to be at the casino this morning. You'll have to ask Frank Jr. That's his department. Is this Frank Jr.'s department, too? I can't speak to that. Because it points to the fact that the KC mob moves cartel money for Byrde Enterprises? Because I can't speak to that.

 Like I said, you're gonna have to ask him. I'm gonna level with you here. We've uncovered more about your boss's operation in the past six hours than we have in the past six months. Now, imagine how far we'll get by the end of the week. You wanna tell me what the fuck is going on here, Marty? I was as blindsided as you, Frank. So what the fuck? My boss is in a war with the Lagunas drug cartel. This was payback. Are you saying we've been walking around all this time with targets on our backs? No, I'm not saying that at all. This stuff never crosses the border. Yeah, well, this one fucking did. You're pissed. I understand. You got every right to be. - Pissed? - Yep. Three of my men were killed. Three. I got raided by the feds, and my son is getting pulled in for questioning. Do you have any idea the amount of shit that you have landed me in? You know, you're not the only one that got hit today. Are you trying to compare losing $20 million - with losing three men? - It's not nothing. Are you out of your fucking mind? I watched those boys grow up. Their families are calling me nonstop. - What the hell am I supposed to tell them? - The truth. Tell them you're as upset as they are, but cooler heads, Frank. Only way we're gonna get through this intact. And this girl of yours, how the fuck did she come out of this alive? She saw them roll up on your men, and she tried to alert them, and it was too late. And this cartel, they're just gonna let her slip away? Don't... Don't go there, Frank. There's nothing there. Now listen, I don't like this any more than you do. Let's just keep our heads down. We let the feds do their job, okay? And then, you know, I know more, you'll know more. I am not a patient man, Marty. Get your fucking house in order. Holy shit! Are you okay? Yeah. Is that weird? I don't even know anymore. Have you talked to Erin? No, she won't text me back. She must be freaking out. Nothing like this has ever happened to her before. Have you shown this to Mom and Dad? I... I promised Ben that I wouldn't tell them we were there. I don't want him to get in trouble. You think I should say something? No, it'll just give them something else to fight about. Answer's the same as it was five minutes ago. She's been in there for hours. You don't say. Can you at least check to see what's going on? Nope. What kind of car do you drive? A Ford Sport Trac. We found these at the scene. Off-terrain, custom upgrade. Now, if we impounded your car, what are the chances your tire tracks would be a match? If a set of tire tracks is your smoking gun, you better get ready to bring in the whole damn county for questioning. I think you were there this morning. It's your name on the manifests. The tire tracks place you at the scene. Now, once we start putting the pieces together, you think Marty and this cartel lawyer are going to stand by your side? I wasn't there. Why are you protecting him? I bet he didn't think twice about killing your father. - Okay, we're done here. - No, I'll answer it. My daddy was in prison for most of my life. I hoped things would change when he got out. But he just... picked up right where he left off. I think there was plenty of people who wanted him dead. You know, Sheriff Nix told me you never once followed up with him on the status of the murder investigation. A daughter who doesn't want to know who killed her father. That strikes me as odd. You don't know a fucking thing about me and my daddy. - Okay, let's go. - First, your uncles turn up dead, then your father gets gunned down. Now, either you're cursed, or this is the cost of loyalty to Marty Byrde. I'll drop you off at home, grab some supplies, pack up the truck, and we'll drive north. No, I can't go anywhere. - Yes, you can. - No, I can't. If I left now, it'd be a huge red flag to the FBI, and they'd come after us. - All the more reason to get a head start. - You're not listening! I can't just pick up and leave. Are you okay? I'm fine. Why? You just seem out of sorts. That's all. What the fuck did my sister say? She's just looking out for you. Yeah. Which part did she lead with? The part about me being bipolar or the part about how you shouldn't be seeing me? She said you stopped taking your medication. Should I be worried? She left when she was 18. She has no actual idea. Seriously. I've spent most of my life off my meds. It's just me here. You gotta trust me, okay? Okay. They took off from a private airfield shortly after the attack. They're no longer a threat. You said that this morning. The Lagunas cartel did what they came to do. Besides, this place is crawling with feds. Trust me, they're not sticking around. And Agent Maya, well, she didn't seem particularly in our pocket. - I'm working on that. - I suggest you work faster. Hey. How's Ruth doing? How do you think she's doing? Hmm. If it's important, he'll call back. Helen Pierce. She's right here. It's for you. Yes. Why didn't you pick up? Because it is not a good time. That's exactly why I'm calling. What do you plan on doing with the FBI situation? You're worried I'm still upset about what happened at the horse farm. Are you? No. But you should know the harm that this does to our reputation. Marty and I are the brand. The brand. That's right. We're your shield, and that shield is your only chance at legitimacy. It is our ability to get those casinos. It is our standing in the community, it is our political contacts. We've even started a charitable foundation to expand our legitimate footprint. If our brand gets damaged, so does your safety net. You think I need you for protection? I think you understand that a person in your position who gets this much notoriety... invites intervention from the US government. You've been smart. You've kept a lower profile than your rivals. And your investment in us is an extension of that. Next time I call... pick up. Who's that? Hey, Sue. That's our therapist. - Marty. - What are you doing here? I wanted to make sure you were okay. Well, that's a hell of a car for a shrink. I heard about that truck assault - on the radio. - Okay. - They're saying it was mob-related... - Yeah, it's not a good time. - ...but it feels more like cartel to me. - You're gonna have to go, okay? You can tell me. Was this us? There is no us. What's this? It's a car. It's a Transformer, and I spoke to you about conspicuous spending. - Send this back. - Now, see, Marty, that's your problem. You are always trying to control everything. - Got it. - Loosen up, put a little sparkle in your step. - Please get back in the toy and leave. - Now, listen, I think we experienced a real breakthrough in our last session. I don't. I'm kicked out of the house. That just means we're going somewhere good. - Well, disagree. - Hey, Sue. Everything okay? Uh, she came by to check on us, but leaving now. Good to see you, Wendy! - Trust the process. - Okay, bye. Agent Evans is expecting us. I thought you said Ruth did okay with the FBI. Doesn't matter. They could still come after her. I'm probably on their radar, too, and it's not just them to worry about. If you witness something like this in Mexico, the cartel would execute you on sight. We need to get off the grid. Do you guys have any cash on you? I mean, most of my money is tied up in cryptocurrency, but I could leverage my blockchain to get you a cash loan. You know what? Don't worry about it. You need a passport to get into Canada. Do you have yours? Shit. Um... Oh, we to drive to Seattle, take one of them buses to Vancouver, - go from there. - Yeah, but you don't have to run. I need food for the ride. Can you pack me something? Sandwiches, uh, chips, anything? No one knows we were there, Ben. There's no one coming after us. - We're safe. - Oh, shit! - What? - Where's my phone? Can one of you guys go see if I left it in the van? Yeah, sure. Come on, Jonah. Come on. Tell Mom. Frank. What the hell was that all about? Hey. I hear you're leaving town with Ruth. - Is that a problem? - No. Actually, I think it's really smart. My one suggestion is that maybe you leave separately, so you don't attract attention. I mean, I can book you a hotel room wherever you want. And then once all this stuff with the FBI dies down, I'll send Ruth to you. What do you think? I think you're a liar. If I leave without Ruth, you're gonna turn her against me. Why would I do that? Same reason you went behind my back and told her I stopped taking my meds. She deserved to know. - Hmm. I was gonna tell her myself. - Hmm. I was. You stole that from me. You stole that from me. I'm worried about you. Don't be. Jonah told me you took him to the money drop this morning. I was trying to protect Ruth. She would be dead right now if it wasn't for me. You put my son in danger. I put your son in danger? Jonah and I just witnessed a massacre. How are we all not leaving right now? How is that boy walking around like there's nothing wrong? How are you sitting here and acting like this is all normal? I don't want you under my roof if you're not gonna take your medication. Fine. Then I will not be under your roof. How well did you know the men who died in the attack? Not well at all. They were arrested with your kids a few days ago. You never had a personal interaction with them? One, maybe. Two? They do any work for you, on the side? No. You're sure about that answer? On the record? This picture's a little blurry, but I'm sure you recognize him. Tommy Walsh. Primary suspect in the casino arson investigation. You were working him as a CI? Is my client a murder suspect? What are we talking about? You found out Tommy was working for us and got your cartel to solve the problem. Same MO as Cade Langmore's murder. Are they accusing me of money laundering or staging this hit? Both. You really think I'm capable of doing that? Who else have you floated this theory by? Cosgrove? Frank Jr.? You know I can't share the details of an ongoing investigation. That piece of shit was working our kids this entire time. Do you know that he was actually trying to fuck my teenage daughter? Could your kids have let anything slip? No. No, no, no. You know that they... they know how to be careful. Fucking FBI. They're just trying to get the KC mob to turn on us. - I know. - Smoke us out any way they can. So, get a new phone, call Wendy. Tell her to sweep the house for bugs. Hey. Hey! What? You're not gonna fucking get away with it. - What are you talking about? - You killed my friend... Shh! Keep your fucking voice down. I don't know what you're talking about. That fed told me that Tommy was a snitch, and Marty had him killed. And you set him up. Wait, what? You knew. You fucking knew, so you had them killed. That's why you switched locations. Listen to me. I'm sorry about your friends. I really am, but I didn't kill them. I was in charge of them. You're drunk, and you need to go home. Do you think I wanted to be here dealing with you? My fucking dad giving me a bullshit babysitting job, and I can't even keep them safe. I'm sorry. Go home. Oh! - Sam Dermody. - Yes? Can I speak with you for a moment? Sure. What's this all about? Math. I'm good at math. Probabilities, abstractions. And by my calculation, you've lost $250,000, give or take. Yeah, uh... You're not gonna tell my girlfriend, are you? No. But I am gonna have to re-examine your financials. Bank statements, pay stubs, all that fun stuff. Wait, you can do that? If I suspect illegal activity. Yeah, but I'm not doing anything illegal. I'm just losing, you know? Well, then you have nothing to worry about. Also, you'll be hearing from the IRS. Oh, fuck. Sam, what's... what's up? Marty, something weird's going on. An FBI agent just came up to me and started asking me for all sorts of records. What do I do? Uh, just, uh, just... um, stop what you're doing and cash out your chips. Wait, no, Wendy said that this was okay. Uh, it is. It's... It's okay. Okay, it doesn't feel very okay. They're just trying to spook you. These agents, they've got quotas and low-hanging fruit gets the job done. Okay? Am I the fruit, Marty? Well, um... I mean, they can't access your records unless they prove that you're doing something illegal, and being a shitty gambler is not a crime. Yeah, that's what I told her, but she wasn't taking it for an answer. Sam, just go home and we'll sort it out in the morning. Fuck. Hey! Fuck you! Hey. I'm sticking around. Yeah. How's she doing? She's out of the operating room. There was internal bleeding, so they had to operate. They said you can come back. I'll let you know how it goes. I swept the house for bugs. It's clear. Uh, Helen wants us to have new phone numbers. I got you a new SIM card. How are you? - How am I? I'm tired, what about you? - Same. You know, the fucking FBI did that to her. They pointed Frank Jr. right at her. Have you talked to Frank Sr.? It's my next stop. What about Maya? - No. - Progress? You know, she's... You know, she's an idealist. She won't take the payday lender info. And she wants to do the job, but she's not willing to bend any rules do it, so. So? So, I need a back channel to the FBI. Um... Even if she won't take it, I bet that her bosses won't give two shits about her principles. So, if that happens, I'll have an opening. I might have an end around that could work. I'll do it first thing. Thanks. Why is the FBI questioning Charlotte's dad? Well, we're just trying to be as helpful as possible. That's all. I was with them two days ago, and... - and now they're dead. - I know. Um... I think it's probably best if you go back home to Chicago. So, that's it? Things get hard and you just want to pawn me off on Dad? No. Well... I thought you'd be happy. I mean, you can hang with Seth. Seth's in Summer League. Dad practically lives at the office. I'm just gonna get stuck listening to his girlfriend talk about thigh gaps and vegan cheese. Um... Can I... Can I just stay with you? Hey, hon. Is everything all right? Is Wyatt around? Come in. He's... Hey. Did you get my texts? Yeah. Then why didn't you come to the hospital? I just... didn't think it'd be a good idea. What's going on? Ruth's in the hospital. Are you gonna tell me what the hell's going on between you guys? It's complicated. You know, she's banged up pretty bad. Broken ribs, internal bleeding. Thanks for letting me know. He made a mistake. Is that what you think this is? A mistake? The kid lost three of his friends. He wasn't thinking straight. He's not a fucking kid. He's a grown man. He beat the shit out of a girl half his size. - She's part of my family, you know that? - Those boys were part of my son's family. Oh, is that right? Because one of them was a CI. You want me to get my fucking house in order? If I had known, I would have handled him myself. How much did that kid give to the feds? You have any idea? Was he wearing a wire? Was anybody else compromised? Cooler heads, Marty. Remember? Fuck that. You can't control your son, and you didn't know Tommy was a snitch. You're a fucking liability, and we're done. You really want to do this? You come anywhere near me, my family or Ruth again, the next time you see your son, he's gonna be hanging from a bridge in Juárez, you got that? This must be a stressful time for you and your husband. Given that three of your employees died in that attack. Well, they were contractors. They were not employees, but... yes, we're reeling. Tell me about this charitable foundation you're starting. My husband and I, we want to fund social causes across the state. Access to healthcare, education. And we're... we're forming an advisory board. Is that anything you would ever consider? I'm flattered, but... given the PR crisis you're facing and your connection to a die-hard conservative like Charles Wilkes... Well, you have every right to have reservations, and look, I'm no fan of Charles' politics, but... Missouri is tilting red, and reaching across the aisle, it's the only way to get anything done. Your work on "Ban the Box," advocating for police reform... I know ambition when I see it. What do you have your sights set on? A congressional seat? Governorship? Because what you need... is political cachet. Are you familiar with a company named Blink Check? They wiped out a lot of families in this community. When we were researching loan services for our casino, we came across some internal documents from Blink's CEO. Cause for another lawsuit if they ever came to light. Could be useful. The publicity certainly wouldn't hurt. I think I could be of service. Great. That is great to hear. How's she doing? Why? So you can interrogate her again? I need you to be honest with me. - What happened out there? - You really think I killed those guys? I don't know what to think. My boss just got a file with the intel you tried to pitch me. - Hmm. - What are you doing? Let me guess. They want you to re-open the case? - They do. - Good. I think I might have been wrong about you. No, Agent Evans did this. You sat there, you listened to his lies, you didn't lift a finger to stop it. Might as well have kicked the shit out of her yourself, you know that? And now you're going around intimidating gamblers on my floor? You want me to be your asset? You learn how to be a better handler. Does Sam Dermody know you're using him to launder money, or are you taking advantage of him like everybody else? Until you're straight with me, I'm gonna keep coming after you. You gonna tell me what happened between you and Ruth? And don't tell me it's complicated. You got more language in you than that. She killed my dad... and my Uncle Boyd. Electrocuted them on the dock of the Blue Cat. Maybe... she had a good reason. Did it to protect Marty Byrde. Oh. If that's the case, your quarrel is not with your cousin. It's with Byrde. That man is a disease. He worms his way in, gets his hooks into people and changes them so they forget who they are. I mean, I saw it happen right in front of me with Jacob. The man I loved for 40 years, like a... a part of me. I watched him turn into something that I... I didn't even recognize. And he knew it, too. He just wasn't strong enough to fight it himself. And that's why I had to kill him. What? - I thought you said he had a heart attack. - He did. It just wasn't entirely natural. Once the Byrdes turned him against me, it was just a matter of time before he turned his back on everything else we built. I couldn't just stand by and watch that. You want to leave? - No, no, it's just a lot. - I know. Lord knows, I miss him. But every time I feel a pang of regret, I remind myself that the man I loved disappeared long before I slipped those cherry pits into his coffee. The point being, it's not too late for Ruth. She can still change her course. Go and see your cousin. So, tell me, how long have you been the Byrde family's lawyer? About a year. How long have you been their therapist? Well, I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say. Patient confidentiality and all. Six months. Give or take. As their lawyer, it's my job to ensure that their interests are protected. So, I would like to discuss your financial relationship with them. I'm not sure what you're referring to. The money for the car. Before I answer, is this conversation covered under attorney-client privilege? Yes, it is. Okay. Are you talking about the bribes they've been paying me behind each other's backs or the lump sum payout Marty cut me the other day? Both. Are you satisfied with the terms that were established? You know... I hate being the squeaky wheel, but now that you bring it up... $100,000 seemed like a lot money at the time, but with this truck ambush and some unexpected... quality of life expenses that have popped up, I'm beginning to think I may have undervalued my services. I'll make sure you're taken care of. Hey. Ruth's vitals are stable. She's been upgraded to fair condition. She's still sedated, but Ben said he'll call me when she wakes up. How is Ben? He's doing better. Jonah, why don't you go inside? Am I interrupting? Go ahead. Go. Can I help you with something? I am losing patience with your husband. Get in line. I appreciate you two spending some time apart. And then I thought, maybe this could offer some perspective on the situation. I'm sorry, but... my kids are home. - I got a friend in the hospital... - Right, chase, cutting to. He's never gonna get a better offer than 18 months and a chance to work with the federal government. That's some criminal fantasy camp shit right there. You do know about the deal, don't you? We discussed it. And you know he was about to take it before he was dragged to Mex... Kansas City? - I do. - So, we're up to speed. We are. Which is why I thought you two spending some time apart might help the situation. - You want me to push him to take the deal. - Push, pull, I want you to do what's best for your family. He's great at what he does. It's a shame he has to do it for a shitty boss. I see why he likes you. So, just... let me be clear on the details. If he takes the deal, he'll be a convicted felon. - That's right. - Mm-hmm. Do you know convicted felons can't hold a casino license in Missouri? I do. Thanks for stopping by. Hey. What... What's going on? Shh. It's all right, it's all right. Just relax. You're in the hospital. You've been out for a day. They found you in the casino parking lot, but you're safe now. You... You've been here the whole time? I didn't want you to wake up alone. You... You look like shit. Did Frank Jr. do this? Uh... I... I... I... I didn't get a good look. Did Wyatt come? No. I'm sorry. Tell Marty and Wendy that... that I need to talk to them. Okay. You must be Frank Jackson. Come in. So, what brings you here, Frank? There's a stray dog that keeps coming into my yard. Seems nice enough. Friendly. Clearly needs a home. But I don't want it. Does that mean there's something wrong with me? Have you ever had a dog before? A husky. He died last year. Got hit by a car. Maybe you're scared that if you take in this stray, you'll be opening yourself up to hurt. Do you think you're avoiding pain? Maybe. Why do you think that is? My job, perhaps. It's better if I don't feel things. I did love my dog. It's easy to confuse vulnerability with weakness. But allowing yourself to be vulnerable is the truest sign of strength. Thank you. That was very helpful. Glad to be of service. If you don't mind me asking, what is it that you do for a living? Could you hold the door, please? Oh. Good to see you. Good to see you, too. I added your name to the card. Thank you. Maya came by the house. She offered you a deal. I didn't say anything, 'cause I wasn't gonna take it. Yes, you were. Hey. Oh, you had us worried. How are you feeling? Like somebody took me apart and put me back together the wrong way. But the drugs ain't bad. Mmm. It's really nice to have you back. You know Frank Jr. did this. You know that, right? Yeah. We've, um... We've, uh, cut ties with the KC mob. You will never have to work with them again. And? What do you mean? Frank Jr. crossed a line. I'm untouchable. That's what you said. Why don't we talk about this later? You've been through a lot... No! I want you to kill him. Let's, uh... Thank you. Um... That's not possible. Doesn't really seem like you're putting it into consideration. Because it can't happen. You didn't see the look on his face. If someone hadn't scared him off, then he would have killed me. There's... There's nothing stopping him from finishing the job. I think you're right, Wendy. We should talk later. Um, I promise you, he's never gonna touch you again. That's not enough. Ruth, Ruth, what he did was unforgivable, and we should have done much more to protect you, and Frank Jr., he'll have to answer for his actions, but... killing him is not a solution. Of course it is. Of all people, I don't understand why the two of you can't see that. Hey, Ruth, we have cut ties, and you just have to accept this is the best version of it. The best for who? Stop acting like you made some huge fucking sacrifice. Tommy was a rat, and the FBI knows they moved money for you. And you would have cut them loose, anyway. If Charlotte was lying in this bed, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. - That is not true. - Come on. You know we love you. You killed my dad. And he barely touched your kid. And you... You had him killed. He did nothing but hurt you your entire life. Fine. Then I'll kill him myself. No, you won't. Then fucking do something about it. We have. It's done. This ends right now. She was a good listener. Do you ever get tired of this? No, not really. Good. Keep your schedule open. Okay. Okay, watch your head here. - Okay. No. - Okay, come on. Up! You gonna carry me around everywhere now? Hell no. You're heavier than you look. - You'll likely throw my back out. - Oh! Stop! - My fucking ribs. Aah! - Okay. - Okay, wait, wait. Let me down. - Okay. Shh. Okay. - You okay? - Yeah. - Yeah? I'm gonna give you a minute. - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. Who's that? Ben. You sure he's not too old for you? Who did this, Ruth? It doesn't matter. Look, I'm... I'm sorry I didn't come visit you in the hospital. I just... I figured the Byrdes were gonna be there - and I just... I really didn't... - It's okay. When I heard about what happened, I just... started thinking about what it would be like if you were gone, and it scared the shit out of me. I think I knew the truth... way before you said it out loud. Why'd you have to say it out loud? I wanted you to hear it from me. I owed you at least that. When I woke up in the hospital... ...there was a... a split-second where I thought I was in my trailer, and I could have sworn I heard Russ and Boyd arguing in the yard. And I was relieved, 'cause... for a second, none of it happened. You didn't hate me. I was clean. I should've done better by you. What do you call it? The Langmore curse? No. I was wrong about that. Who we are ain't so bad. It's the Byrdes that cursed everything. The minute that they showed up, everything got turned upside down. I... I don't know who you are when you're with them. I haven't changed. Yes, you have. It's okay. It's fine. I want to forgive you. I... I really do. Uh... I'm just not there yet. So, what now?
