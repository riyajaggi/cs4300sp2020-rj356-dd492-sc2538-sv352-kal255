 Holmes was certainly not an easy man to live with,
 but as the weeks went by, my interest in his character deepened and increased.
 There seemed to be no end to his energy.
 His eyes were sharp and piercing,
 save during those intervals of torpor into which he fell from time to time.
 His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals,
 yet he was possessed of an extraordinary delicacy of touch,
 as I frequently had the occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.
 One may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess
 how much this man stimulated my curiosity,
 and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence
 which he showed on all that concerned himself.
 Sherlock Holmes
 It's an ambush!
 Chapter Two: Rock, Paper, Scissors
 Come in, come in, sit down.
 I’ll fix it up, no one will notice.
 So, returning to our previous conversation,
 I must say, you make it all seem so incredibly simple. Hold that for a minute.
 You remind me Dupin, from Edgar Allan Poe’s stories, have you read them?
 I thought such individuals could only, oh, I don't know... could only exist in novels, only in...
 Doctor, when you compare me to Dupin you no doubt think that you're complimenting me, yes?
 Well, in my opinion, he was a rather dim-witted person.
 How can you break in on a man’s thoughts with a random remark after a whole 15 minutes’ silence? It really is a very cheap trick.
 Right... Well, fine. Perhaps you could recount something else?
 You understand, I like your stories, they are somehow...
 ...enthralling, I don't know...
 What do you find enthralling about a man killing another?
 Well...
 What is enthralling about that?
 Do you find the ideas of greed, anger, hate, death, and blood enthralling?
 Well, I suppose these ideas are timeless.
 For example, what is enthralling about the story
 of a bankrupt landowner who kills his wife and step daughters, each a year apart?
 He poisoned them with arsenic.
 When he was caught, he said that one of them had died of whooping cough and the second one from a snake's bite.
 And?
 He said it was a whip snake.
 Those aren’t dangerous.
 He killed them for the inheritance.
 Do you find this story enthralling?
 What do you think, a visitor for you, or for me?
 A man, about 35, in a big hurry.
 Although he’s missing a leg.
 - Doctor, you wrote that the disabled get discounts...
- Small!
 Water! Water! Hot water!
 - Legs! Help me.
- Go.
- Careful.
 Look at me! Look at me! Breathe, breathe, breathe! Give me the box.
 No, this one, with scissors! Scissors!
 Look at me! Look at me!
 - The end...
- Small!
- A draw-well...
 He said he's your friend.
 Open the door! It's the police!
 In the name of the Queen! Open up, it's the police!
 We have no choice, we'll have to open the door or he’ll break it down.
 Open the door! I know you're home!
 Remove the dog!
 So, Holmes, where is he?
 Who do you mean?
 That gentleman with his innards hanging out
 who left this bloody track all the way from Stroud Green to your front door.
 What's that on your hands, huh?
 The doctor is operating.
 I'm assisting him.
 You don't need to show the way.
 He was carrying something in his hands.
 - He had—
- He had nothing.
 Can I ask what actually happened?
 No! I will be asking the questions!
 Who is this man? Do you know him? How did he get here?
 This is Peter Small, he—
 Peter Small. That's how he introduced himself when he asked Mr. Watson for help.
 Mr. Watson, if you haven't forgotten, is a doctor.
 Is he so great that this poor man hopped to him from Stroud Green on one leg just to surrender his soul to God under his supervision?
 Do you think I believe that?
 Here, look at this.
 "Baker Street...
 ...Discounts for veterans and the disabled".
 So you're claiming this is the first time you've seen this man?
 Yes, Inspector.
 Watson, what about you?
 Yes, the first time.
 Sir, we found nothing.
 Constable Higgins, call for a stretcher.
 Yes, sir.
 I will probably need you for a testimony.
 Go!
 Any explanation you can give would be helpful, Doctor.
 Who was this Peter Small?
 I can't. I can't, Doctor.
 Look at me.
 - Don't make agreements! Begin!
- No, no, no.
 - I can't.
- Look at me!
 Begin!
 Rock, paper, scissors, and a draw-well's also needed, one, two, three!
 One more time!
 - I can't, doctor.
- Look!
 Rock, paper, scissors, and a draw-well's also needed, one, two, three!
 You're cunning!
 Do it one more time!
 Listen!
 Doctor!
 Listen.
 Don't make agreements!
 Rock, paper, scissors, and a draw-well's also needed, one, two, three!
 You decided it yourself! Go.
 - Wait! Wait! He won't run away!
- Doctor!
 - Doctor! Doctor!
- He won't run away!
 - Doctor!
- He won't! Wait!
 They only- only had one pair of shackles...
 ...two of us—
 - They- they had- the ammunition, knives- an infinite supply, but- one- one pair- two—
- Calm down. Calm down,
 calm down, Doctor, it’s becoming difficult to understand you.
 So they proposed to cast lots. A random choice.
 Tell me about this man in more detail.
 Lieutenant Small...
 from Liverpool...
 ...an open guy, had a wife who died... moved to our regiment because of phthisis, I think...
 We went through a lot.
 And that's why you hid the bundle in the cupboard?
 I suspect that these gems and gold don’t actually belong to him.
 No doubt if Lestrade found them he would accuse him of robbery.
 No, I don’t believe it! I don’t believe that Small could commit a crime.
 If I were you I would hide it in a more creative place.
 I'm sure that in less than an hour Lestrade will bring his people back here and turn the whole house upside down.
 On the bright side, the grannies will be moving out.
 The fifth search this year, they won't handle this.
 But if he did something against the law?
 We need to hand it back. We need to give it to Lestrade.
 - No way.
- What?
 We’re going to St. Mark's Orphanage.
 Your friend has a child.
 Take a pair of scissors with you.
 Did you know, John, that every orphanage has its own colours?
 The yellow, blue, and white here are the colours of St. Mark's Orphanage.
 Children craft these ribbons on holidays for their relatives.
 So the scissors will be a great gift for crafting.
 Holmes, I have absolutely no idea how to talk to children.
 Do you need to talk differently to them?
 Another bloody crime! A gang of cabmen!
 Chronicle!
 - Read the Chronicle!
- Catch!
 - Read the Chronicle! Another bloody murder!
- Strange...
 strange, strange case.
 A carriage is missing, a gang of cabmen are suspected.
 That's silly.
 What's silly?
 Everything.
 He wasn't a cabman. Small couldn't have taken part in this. He couldn't.
 - As far as I know, you haven't seen each other for three years.
- Three years.
 He wasn't a cabman.
 He was a cabman. There was an old callus between his index and middle fingers.
 - So what does it mean?
- Take a look at cabmen's hands.
 And the soles of his boots weren't worn even though the leather was rather old.
 Is it true cabmen very rarely walk on their feet?
 By the way, what time is it? The orphanage opens at nine o’clock.
 All right, fine. Fine, let's say he was a cabman.
 Quarter to ten. But maybe Small was trying to retrieve the jewellery
 and paid for it?
 My condolences for your brother’s death.
 Anyhow, you examined Small, what can you say about the wound?
 Well, I don't want to jump to conclusions, I didn't do the autopsy.
 But you are an army doctor, you've seen a lot of wounds.
 What was it inflicted with?
 I don't know. Something long, narrow...
 - an epée.
- Here!
 Ah, good day, Miss,
 could we, uh, talk with your immediate superiors?
 Tell them that Mr., uh, Sherlock Holmes and John Watson would, uh, would like a word.
 Good day, gentlemen!
 Can I help you?
 - Yes.
- Lucy, go join the other children. Lucy, do you want a whipping? Go to the children.
 We wish to meet with a child who is related to Peter Small.
 Mary Small, his daughter.
 It's her visiting day today.
 - Are we not the first ones?
- You are the third.
 Why, only just now a gentleman came to talk with Mary.
 - Show us the way.
- Did something happen?
 No, we hope nothing happened.
 In the morning, Mr. Small’s colleagues came, but they were probably looking for him, because to be honest,
 we are looking for him as well, he owes us 30 pounds for the last three months.
 - Rock, paper, scissors, one, two, three...
 - Did they introduce themselves?
- Of course they did. We are very strict with this.
 - Who were they?
- I don’t remember. In here.
 I lost! Now, one, two, three, four, five, six...
 - Mary, what are doing?
- Excuse us, we were just playing.
 - Ted?
- John?
 - Asclepius!
- Ted!
- John! John!
 Miss Mary, this is for you.
 Give it to me, I will put it on your nightstand. I will leave you for a moment.
 Sherlock Holmes.
 - Ted. Thaddeus Sholto, my saviour. Our saviour.
- Stop it.
 Pleased to meet you.
 But why are you here?
 We came here to visit Miss Mary.
 Where is Peter?
 He asked us to visit her. He doesn't have time right now.
 Yes, I've been looking for him as well.
 - Do you know where he is? His address, where does he live?
- At the same place.
 - Where?
- Same place.
 Are you acquainted with daddy?
 Mary, we're not just acquainted, we... we are daddy's friends.
 - When did he visit you?
- Yesterday. He was so sad.
 Sad? He didn't say why?
 No. I'm sorry, just a minute.
 John!
 How long have you been looking for him?
 Two days.
 We’re holding a gathering of the regiment's veterans.
 "Beat the drum, play the trumpet, slash the enemy, prick the enemy!" John, I remember.
 By the way, we invited Dr. Watson, Lieutenant, did you receive the invitation?
 - Yes. Oh, no, no, I... no.
- How come?
 I have something to tell you—
 John told me you saved him and Peter Small from captivity.
 What are you saying, it was just a military operation. John is the hero, he's the one who saved Peter.
 You can't even imagine: under those extreme conditions he had to amputate,
 treat the wound, sew it up, ensure that he didn’t get blood poisoning, this is...
 In any case, the last time I saw Small he was doing great, runs like the wind, even with his stump...
 - You know, Peter...
- He's still treating his leg.
 Our humid climate still gives him trouble,
 - this climate...
- I will guess now.
 This is daddy, yes?
 This is Mr. Morstan, he visited me today with Mr. Briggs.
 Here is Briggs, and here is Mr. Sholto.
 Where are you, Mr. Watson?
 Mary, can I look at this photograph? Look, it is me indeed.
 Watson, well Watson is a doctor,
 he was studying at that time at the University of London.
 - Briggs, Kudrow.
- Briggs!
 - Karpinsky, died near Kandahar.
- Yes.
 Who is this?
 - I don't know.
- I don't remember, a professor or something.
 Look, all young, happy.
 How long ago was it all?
 Another life...
 A whole other life...
 You know, a soldier has two lives: one before the war,
 - and one after.
- The doctor is right, Mary,
 but sadly there are unfortunates like Karpinsky who have only one life - before the war.
 Can we take this photograph?
 No, it's mine.
 Do you want a whipping?
 Holmes!
 - Fine, but only for a while.
- We should go.
 What?
 Go.
 Go, the cab is waiting, ask him to wait a bit longer.
 - Wait...
- Let's go together.
 - We'll be right back.
- What are... no, of course, go, go... I will wait for you here.
 - I thought I was bad with children, but you!
 Listen, children are actually easy to talk to, but your Captain...
 What about the Captain?
 It seems to me that he arrived suspiciously on time.
 Listen, this is Sholto, he's my friend, and an officer, for heaven’s sake, Holmes—
 I’ll remember that. Apologies for keeping you waiting.
 Come on, Doctor. Go!
 - Do you have your gun with you?
- No, what's happening?
 We’ve been abducted.
 Webley, MK3.
 Everyone alive?
 MK5, I think.
 How mant times have you saved my life, Captain? I don't know how to thank you.
 - Stop it.
- No, but...
 There! Morstan.
 How did I not recognise him?
 Who usually pays attention to cabmen?
 Morstan...
 - You were right, MK3.
- Right.
 By the way, how did you get here?
 I was following you.
 Small... died.
 - What are you saying? When? How?
- He died...
 ...right in my arms this morning.
 An interesting construction.
 Blood stains on the floor, thoroughly washed out.
 What are you looking for in there?
 Doesn't matter.
 "Dr. John H. Watson... opens up a medical practice...
 discounts for veterans and the disabled, 221B Baker Street". Can you drive a carriage?
 Holmes, why are you in such a hurry?
 When we were going to the orphanage, they were standing across from the house and waiting!
 Watson, where did you put the jewels?
 Mrs. Hudson...
 Holmes, go faster!
 Faster!
 Mrs. Hudson!
 Where are you Mrs. Hudson, are you all right?
 Where are you?
 - What? My god!
- God! Watson.
- There, there, everything's all right.
 - Are you all right?
- Doctor, I was so frightened...
 Watson, check the bundle!
 They found the bundle, but still turned the flat inside out.
 When did it happen?
 As soon as you left. I didn't think there would be that many guests.
 How many?
 Three.
 Did you manage to get a look at them? No?
 Not really.
 Think. Now...
 Look, do you recognise anyone here?
 Relax, relax.
 This one.
 Where?
 Here.
 - And this one!
- Briggs!
- Kudrow.
 And the third one? The third?
 - I don't remember the third one because I hid in the closet.
- You did the right thing.
 In the closet? They didn't look in the closet?
 - They did...
- And then?
 - But I hid behind the door.
- Good.
 - They came so close, it was so terrifying...
- I can imagine.
 What is going on here?
 Drink, drink.
 When Small came to me with
 his guts hanging out, he had with him a bundle of jewellery.
 Mr. Sholto! Mr. Sholto,
 who is this man?
 You've asked that already.
 And you didn't remember.
 And so...
 I believe he taught physics in Oxford.
 So...
 Stop, wait, are you saying that—
 - Small, and Briggs, and Kudrow...
- But, but, but, I, what... Small died.
 - I told you!
- Where did he get the jewellery from?
- How would I know?
 He was probably keeping it safe for someone, I don't- I don't believe- that an officer could do—
 Officer Briggs, Officer Kudrow, Officer Morstan, they're all here!
 They were in despair, I don't know, they were-
 they were poor, they were always borrowing money—
 Poverty is not an excuse, Doctor.
 - But how could they?
- You know that all three were sentenced for marauding?
 No.
 No? I even vouched for them.
 So there is my fault in this as well.
 That's it, Mrs. Hudson!
 That's it! Mrs. Hudson, it has gone too far!
 Either you throw out these gentlemen right now or we're packing.
 Them or us!
 Mr. Watson, call a cab, please.
 Too much honour. They will walk!
 It's not for them, it's for you.
 But we didn't plan to go anywhere.
 You did, you wanted to leave.
 - But only—
 - If Holmes and Watson remain here.
- That's right!
 They will remain here.
 You've lost your mind!
 Fine, no, but fine, fine...
 Left without tenants!
 - And they even paid for the flat on time.
- Yes, I understand.
 Mrs. Hudson, I understand everything.
 I realise that in such a situation it is my duty
 to leave and not encroach further on your hospi—
 Don't you dare!
 Mrs. Bokley and Mrs. Softley are already leaving, and now you want
 you want to leave me with this Mr. Holmes?!
 I- I- Mrs. Hudson, I understand, but Mrs. Bokley and Mrs.—
 Mrs. Hudson.
 Mr. Watson is ready to rent the two vacant rooms and to pay for them six months in advance.
 I owe Dr. Watson for some service.
 How much?
 Twenty five pounds.
 But I won't allow them in there.
 They have destroyed enough of the house already.
 Here's 30.
 Now you are free to send them to the basement, if you wish it.
 Captain of Her Majesty's Army,
 Thaddeus Sholto.
 Mrs. Hudson.
 What a woman!
 Is she a widow?
 Watson, this isn’t like you!
 She is not completely indifferent to you, can't you see?
 You misunderstand.
 He doesn't notice— or pretends he doesn’t!
 Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.
 I've met so many different women in my life, African, Eastern,
 - European—
- How did you talk to the Eastern ones if they're always wearing burqas?
 Mr. Holmes, if there's a woman,
 an officer will always find a way to talk to her. What do you say, Watson?
 Come, we’re civilised people... Sholto—
 Do you know, Mr. Holmes, that Englishmen tear off weavers’ fingers in India
 so that Indian silk
 can’t compete with our own products? How’s that for civilisation?
 Oh, John, it’s so good to see you again!
 It’s been almost two years.
 Now, I expect you at my house this evening.
 No excuses.
 I'm sure we’ll have lots to talk about.
 Mr. Watson! "Discounts for veterans and the disabled"!
 - Yes. Do you reprint photographs?
- Of course, sir.
 Could you please print this one?
 Excellent. Just a photograph?
 No, and this text as well.
 - "Lieutenant Peter Small..."
- "...wishes to meet with his friends..."
 Yes, there's the date and address.
 And even the time.
 - Yes.
- Excellent.
 And one more thing, I would like the photograph back immediately after.
 Then you'll have to wait, sir.
 Hey, you, aren’t you a bit lost? What are you doing here?
 Call that whiskered one for me.
 Mr. Holmes!
 I didn't recognise you from a distance.
 Mr. Holmes, are you here to join us fellow cabmen?
 Are you free?
 You know this yourself, freedom is not up to us, Mr. Holmes.
 Tell me, whose cab is this?
 I think that's Morstan's, but he's not from this cabstand, sir.
 Which one, then?
 The one on Baker Street, near the underground.
 I drove this cab across the whole city for nothing then.
 Are you looking for Morstan?
 I haven't seen him since yesterday, Mr. Holmes.
 I'm looking for his den.
 Then it wasn't for nothing. I will show you.
 Take a seat.
 Don't drive too fast, Mr. Holmes.
 Well, I've read your manuscript,
 but I wasn't surprised.
 I am afraid to say that it contains as many clichés
 as there are stylistic errors.
 For example?
 Let's take this:
 "Beat the drum, play the trumpet, slash the enemy, prick the enemy".
 Yes, but what's wrong with it?
 My dear author,
 can't you hear it?
 If it was, for example,
 "Beat the drum, play the trumpet, slash the turban, prick the enemy"...
 I'm sorry,
 but why a turban?
 You see, the thing is
 you can only cut off a turban, as you say, along with a head.
 You make it seem like a turban could somehow
 be cut off independently from the head, as if...
 I agree, well, I agree.
 But you must work on the rhythm.
 Look here,
 do you want to become the second Kipling?
 The original one is already out of fashion.
 You see, a reader wants some fresh air. A romantic love story
 cut tragically short by a horrible crime,
 followed by 250 heart-thumping pages of investigation... something like that,
 I think, could work rather well.
 Charles Dickens, for example, wasn't averse to writing mystery.
 Wilkie Collins, Charlotte Brontë, at least...
 How much?
 I'm sorry?
 How much must I pay you
 to print my poem?
 - On the front page,
 - in the middle, in the end?
- On the front page.
 Four pounds.
 There you are.
 Very well...
 How much do you take for, let's say,
 detective stories?
 We pay for them, sir.
 All done, sir,
 the day after tomorrow your notice will appear on the second page.
 Thank you, and my photograph, please?
 Oh! I forgot it in the room.
 Well, then, please go and get it.
 It's closed now, sir.
 I need my photograph.
 I'm sorry, but it's impossible.
 Listen, I am an invalid.
 If I kill you, nobody will suspect it was me.
 There’s no need for such drastic measures, sir, here is your photograph, preserved and untouched, I’m sorry...
 Why would you need it?
 I don't, I don't,
 - there was a visitor, he was interested and—
- Where is he?
 He offered money. There, he was standing in the corridor.
 Sir, sir, please forgive me.
 And Morstan, Kudrow, Briggs, Williams, do you know them?
 I don't know Williams, sir, but the other three have their beds here together.
 I haven't seen them for three days.
 Maybe they are working,
 or maybe they've found another shelter,
 but their belongings are still here.
 Who knows where they are, sir.
 I wouldn’t leave here myself,
 especially not on my own,
 I’m too old for that.
 And freedom isn’t up to us.
 They are the same.
 Do you wear uniforms now?
 What uniform, sir?
 What's the name of this cabstand?
 We don't have a cabstand, sir,
 our owner is fat Fitcher. Our lads usually just say "go to Fitcher".
 Fitcher is an all right man, sir.
 He was a cabman himself,
 he doesn't allow anyone to harm us
 and doesn't charge very much.
 He’s very tight on coal though,
 it gets cold during the night, sir.
 - But warm places...
- They are the same.
- ...are not up to us.
 Yes,
 all of us have one, sir.
 Small made them for us
 for a shilling and eightpence each,
 even though the same one costs two and one at the store.
 A good thing, comfortable and practical, but with one flaw.
 What's that?
 You said it yourself,
 they are the same.
 What have they done?
 I see that you are very curious.
 Curiosity is our nature, sir,
 it's our job, you know,
 we see so much every day.
 And John says,
 "Sholto, you stay here and wait for me, I must run to my tent,
 I’ve used up all the thread just mending you alone!"
 Imagine him, running about, "Excuse me, do you have any thread? Thread, please, I need thread!"
 Excuse me, sorry, excuse me,
 that was left by my housekeeper.
 I remember, another case...
 Thaddeus, look at it this way,
 since you’ve paid for our housing,
 at least let me give you a check-up.
 There's no need, Doctor.
 Let's see now.
 Holmes, you’re all right with this? I will need to undress.
 So, John, do you remember which ones are your handiwork?
 Yes, of course.
 Look, Mr. Holmes.
 This is the burden of the white man. It’s what I call them.
 From time immemorial we’ve been bringing our civilisation to the East.
 If we won't impose our culture on them,
 they will impose theirs on us.
 The Crusaders destroyed and burned cities of the Saracen,
 and the Saracen... do you know what the Saracen did to us?
 Inhale.
 Hold it.
 Exhale.
 This is what I mean. Look at
 Small, for example.
 No, Colonel Kipling was right
 when he talked about the East and the West.
 John and I are the same crusaders, aren't we, John?
 Along with Morstan, Briggs, Kudrow...
 Yes.
 So what is it?
 - The mitral valve.
- The mitral valve.
 Yes, you need to exercise, exercise.
 We were taught how to fight and were taught it well.
 The people you met are not just a gang of cabmen,
 these are people who can kill, and they have done so more than once.
 John, I believe it is my duty to go with you.
 - Do you know why?
- Why?
 Because an officer can be judged...
 ...only by another officer.
 The crosses on the graves of our friends
 will become the base of European civilisation in these wild mountains.
 It’s always been like that.
 The Indian invention
 works here as well.
 According to Muslim traditions they have to bury the dead before dawn,
 but I'll make sure there's nothing to bury.
 Please don't, Captain.
 Then kill them yourself.
 I can't do that, I'm a doctor.
 Ted, please, we’re civilised people.
 I can do it.
 Small.
 So what’ll it be, Afghans? Let's play, eh?
 If you win, we free you, is that it?
 Rock, paper, scissors, and the draw-well's also needed, eh?
 Allahu Akbar!
 Rumours about the arrival of the Indian prince incognito!
 A gang of cabmen terrifies whole of London!
 Rumours about the arrival of the Indian prince incognito! A gang of cabmen terrifies whole of London!
 There is a woman waiting for you.
 They cut it!
 I’m sorry, what woman?
 She didn't introduce herself.
 You've gotten older.
 A little. It suits you.
 It's just a blanket.
 It's nice in here.
 Lots of funny little trinkets.
 It's so cute! Where did you get it from?
 You're next.
 Oh?
 What do you want?
 - What, I can't visit an old—
- No, you can't!
 You can't.
 What do you want? Why did you come?
 I came to say yes.
 To what question?
 The one you asked in Paris.
 And the others as well.
 To move away from the city with you?
 Yes.
 To be obedient? Gentle?
 Yes.
 Loyal?
 Yes.
 Until death do us part.
 Stop it.
 Yes.
 What do you want? What?
 I want you to stop being angry.
 How many times do I have to plead for you to forgive me?
 You can't forgive the fact that I deceived you?
 I can't forgive myself for trusting you!
 She wants to go away with me!
 She’s finished milking the latest old fool and now she wants to go away with me!
 But I'm not going anywhere!
 Yes! I need to go away.
 Sherlock, I need to go away, really.
 I will go away with you forever.
 Please!
 This is just your pride speaking, don't you understand? I-
 I came here myself!
 What else do you want? I'm ready for anything, I'll agree to anything, just say the word.
 I’ll kneel if you want me to!
 C'mon. Kneel.
 Please!
 What are you doing? What are you doing?
 Excuse me, Mr. Holmes, are you all right?
 Yes, no need worry.
 Is this woman bothering you?
 No.
 This woman is leaving now.
 Very well.
 If you need my help, just say it and I’ll happily oblige,
 but I won't ever play by your rules!
 And I was ready to play by yours.
 For my whole life.
 Goodbye!
 It's not my business, of course,
 - but your acquaintance...
- No need, I know everything about her.
 I wouldn't believe a single word she says.
 The fools should have their hands cut off!
 Just a minute, Holmes!
 I need to show you the photograph.
 Look, they cut it.
 They just cut it.
 What? What did... what—
 Don't you see it?
 No...
 I'll show you.
 What... what happened?
 Holmes, what's wrong?
 - Holmes?
- Just a minute ago this photo was stolen from me.
 Why?
 My God,
 there are thousands of these photographs now.
 Why does it matter?
 It does matter.
 Firstly, what will we give back to Mary Small?
 And secondly,
 that professor was the most important thing that photograph had.
 To hell with him! The photograph is blurry anyway, and it's too late to—
 You cannot be this stupid, Doctor!
 I'm telling you this is the most important thing that the photograph has!
 I'm not stupid!
 And you're forgetting something.
 Later, everything can wait till later!
 Wait, I'm going with you!
 No!
 Why not?!
 Because he's ashamed.
 Of what?!
 He's ashamed that he's also human.
 Soho!
 Where are you going?
 This is ridiculous. I don't have anything anyway.
 Where are you taking me?
 Tracey, are you in with those cabmen?
 Lestrade won't like it.
 Lestrade could not know anything.
 Good afternoon, Inspector.
 Are you questioning the legality of my activities again?
 Do you have a warrant?
 Go out.
 So, what is it this time?
 I asked Inspector Lestrade to bring you here. Good afternoon, Sherlock.
 Peter Small, whose body Lestrade removed from your house this morning, participated in a conspiracy against the Queen.
 The carriage they attacked was carrying the Indian prince. He had arrived secretly in London
 to meet with Her Majesty.
 We had been preparing this meeting for three years.
 Good afternoon, Mycroft, I am glad to see you as well.
 I'm doing well, thank you, although I did get ill last winter,
 but it wasn’t anything serious, just a common cold.
 Sherlock, stop.
 This meeting was supposed to decide the fate of our Indian colonies.
 In any case, the boy was only ten.
 What, the fate of the Indian colonies depends on a boy?
 Rishvari Shah, Padishah's son, a local princeling.
 His father was one of the leaders of the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857.
 They hid with family in Bengal, and the son was born and grew up somewhere in the mountains.
 The father formed a squad, attacking the railway,
 killing our patrols, robbing banks,
 distributing the gold to the poor. He was like Robin Hood amongst the locals,
 they called him their Raja.
 A year and a half ago we managed to hunt down his family in Agra.
 Everybody died during the fight except for the boy,
 whom we brought to London.
 Yesterday evening we were driving him to the palace.
 In the morning there should have been a meeting and signing of a peace agreement.
 As the heir he could do it.
 But the cab stopped the carriage,
 they attacked, the prince was killed,
 and the treasures stolen.
 You said Peter Small participated,
 but why are you so sure this wasn’t just a robbery?
 This is Francis Carfax,
 a secret agent and my helper.
 He was killed in Bombay a day before the boy was due to depart for England.
 This was the nature of the injury.
 I need to look at Peter Small's body, Inspector.
 A very clever stab.
 The blade touched the liver,
 went through the lung,
 and hit the aorta.
 Do you follow?
 Blood from the liver and the aorta slowly filled the lungs
 and was eventually coughed up.
 No chances of survival. An exceptionally clever stab.
 An autopsy of Carfax wasn't made,
 but you can see the location and the form of the wound yourself.
 The boy is already dead, what do you want me to do?
 The casket, Sherlock.
 These were family jewels and relics of his kin.
 They have to be found or at least made so that they will never float on the territory of the Kingdom.
 The white man's burden is hard, isn't it?
 You planned the meeting three years ago, and a year and a half later you murdered the family.
 Lestrade, what do you think?
 The murder of the whole family, kidnapping a little boy
 to acquire the inheritance— isn't that a crime?
 Sometimes not. Sometimes it's politics.
 - Our target is to stop the massacre in the colonies.
- Yes.
 And Scotland Yard, of course, is not dormant.
 We've taken two.
 They are giving their testimonies now.
 Interesting, who are they?
 Here are the darlings.
 So, you robbed the carriage of the Indian prince?
 - Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
 And killed him?
 - Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
 And his wife?
 Exactly, sir.
 And his kids as well?
 We did. Yes, sir, we killed them, sir. Yes.
 Wife? What wife?
 - Berkley!
- I'm listening, sir.
 Well you're a terrible listener. Idiots!
 Who did you arrest?
 - Sorry, sir.
- Get out!
- Yes, sir.
 Surely you'll have to free and apologise to these people.
 Now we are stuck.
 I can help you.
 So Max Dale... died near Peshawar.
 The poor man got his eyes gouged out
 and then his head chopped off.
 I went to his mother's house in Norfolk
 to give her his medal.
 Watson, let's- let's row slower.
 How is your wound?
 It plays up sometimes,
 always at the wrong time.
 So, what happened to Gibbson?
 Oh, Gibbson...
 Gibbson lost his arm near Kandahar.
 Now lives in Liverpool,
 - recently had triplets.
- Oh?
 A half.
 Another half an hour.
 Ths is a bad position.
 - Your friend, Mr. Holmes...
- He'll be here.
 - Definitely.
- Who is he?
 A scientist. He studies deduction.
 Never heard of it.
 So many new sciences appeared while we were fighting. Did he serve anywhere?
 No, he's a full civilian. He doesn't like the military.
 Small?
 You said he died.
 Peter Small died,
 but Briggs and Kudrow don't know anything about it.
 And this... this is Holmes.
 He didn't learn how to fill the pipe properly.
 Small? Peter, is that you?
 A bad position.
 Small, is that you?
 Do you have the gold?
 It's not Small! Where is the gold?
 Holmes! Holmes!
 I'm fine!
 They'll kill us.
 A very bad position.
 They're on the left!
 Don't go there!
 Watson! Watson, is it happening again?
 You fire, Holmes and I will do the rowing.
 Get in the boat!
 Quick, quick!
 Watson, what's the time?
 Do you hear that? It's the police!
 Go!
 Three minutes past eight!
 Fire, Watson!
 Wait, I see, sir... sighting range!
 - Go!
- They're too far away.
- Go!
- I only have three bullets left.
 Holmes, tell me, how did you learn about my brother's death from the watch?
 It's not the right moment, Watson!
 Agreed.
 Captain Smith,
 Captain... Grimpson.
 - Everyone from the photograph?
- Fire, damn it!
- No, not everyone.
 Smith.
 - Grimpson, fire!
- Yes, sir!
 Grimpson.
 Holmes, are you all right?
 Watson!
 Where's Watson?
 Watson! John!
 Hold onto the boat.
 Alive.
 Are you all right? Raise your hands! It's the police!
 There were more than just two. Good thing we came in time.
 You think it was in time?
 Exactly.
 Where is the treasure?
 Don't worry, they won't float.
 This is one exhilarating life you lead, Watson!
 Sorry.
 We need to see each other more often. Today at six, remember?
 Yes, another half an hour in the wind and you'll definitely get pneumonia with your...
 Doctor...
 ...always the doctor.
 The cabs are here!
 Be careful, Gregson, you'll fall into the water.
 Thank you.
 Today at six, please be there.
 Did they apologise to you?
 If you call a kick in the ass an apology, then yes, many times, and with utmost sincerity!
 And how's the fat guy?
 He’s lost a lot of weight since, but he'll live.
 You're trembling. Do you need a plaid?
 No, I'm not cold.
 I shot six people today.
 You're very good at shooting.
 That's Small's pipe.
 It was in this pocket. These are his clothes. Look, what an interesting wound!
 The blade was thin, 15 inches in length. It pierced the liver, went through the lungs, and ended all the way up in the aorta.
 I don’t wish to disappoint you, but your friend Small, along with Kudrow, Morstan and Briggs,
 did indeed rob the carriage and kill a ten year old Indian boy.
 You can't even imagine how interesting and twisted this case is.
 I haven't understood everything yet, but I’ll pursue it until I do. Are you with me?
 I understand how you feel.
 I don't think you understand.
 Sorry, Holmes, you’re on your own this time. I...
 I need to go home... take a bath... Don't want to catch a cold.
 Stop! We're here.
 Am I free, sir?
 Mr. Holmes, why must you trample all over the floor in these wet shoes?
 Was it raining today?
 How did you get wet?
 It's absolutely contraindicated for Venus to wet its feet in the phase of Aquarius.
 Do you want tea?
 No, thanks.
 ...And you, Mr. Watson, would you like some tea?
 No, thank you.
 Doctor, are you sure you don't want to come?
 Yes.
 Do you want me to tell you how I learned about your brother's death from your watch?
 No.
 Fine. I will do it during dinner.
 Mrs. Hudson, what are we having for dinner today?
 Dinner.
 Welcome.
 Welcome.
 So, Mr. Holmes,
 I would like to clear up some details of this case
 before writing the report.
 All the criminals are lying in my basement in a row.
 This case is closed.
 What are you interested in?
 The loot.
 Where is the treasure?
 I told you.
 That they won't float?
 I could believe it...
 ...but...
 ...I don't.
 Tracey, close the door, don’t let anyone in.
 Yes, sir.
 Now, let's be honest.
 Where is it?
 Gone.
 Lestrade, you are preventing me from catching the criminal,
 the criminal whose real goal is to prevent peace with the rebels.
 He doesn't give a damn about the treasure, and you know it.
 Of course he's against it.
 Your inferences are absurd,
 and nothing more. I think you’re trying especially hard to lure our attention
 away from the sudden disappearance of the treasure.
 Perhaps so you can take it for yourself when the moment is right.
 You want to change my mind? Speak!
 He organised it all.
 He mortally wounded Small, even though
 he could easily have killed him.
 He left the treasure with Small, even though he could have taken it. Why?
 It’s unclear. He organised it all, so that the attackers are all in your basement, as you said, "in a row".
 They're all dead, aren't they?
 This person recently returned from India,
 he knew every single one of the deceased,
 and he is a retired officer!
 Stop your tales.
 Where is the treasure?
 In the Thames.
 Small told me before he died that he threw them under Lambeth Bridge.
 The criminal wanted Small to die on the street, so
 the treasure would be snatched up and immediately spread around the market.
 Trust me, I'm not just confident, I know it.
 No, you don't, it's just your guess.
 I’d wager you can’t tell me the name of this person.
 Thaddeus
 Sholto.
 Mr. Watson, I decided to make you some tea.
 Thank you, I'll have it later.
 Mr. Watson,
 could you help me move the cupboard in the kitchen?
 I can't do it alone.
 With pleasure, but later.
 Mr. Watson! You are going to Mr. Sholto, aren't you?
 He said that scarf was left there by his housekeeper.
 It's made of an expensive Indian silk and depicted symbols of a ritual.
 These things are not for sale, they’re trophies!
 English housekeepers don't use Indian lotus and Muscat as a perfume!
 All the attackers
 were experienced fighters,
 all of them were retired military men, you know that as well as me,
 and I'm sure, I bet my life,
 that Sholto has served with every single one of them at some point in his career!
 And if I were you I would watch him very, very carefully.
 Why?
 We’ll just arrest and interrogate him.
 He’ll give us all his helpers.
 If there are any, of course.
 Watson.
 He is not a good person.
 How do you know?
 Mr. Holmes needs to jump around on roofs and collect cigarette ends to know it.
 But I'm a woman.
 Please stay.
 I can't.
 But why?
 Because an officer can be judged only by another officer.
 Watson! Are you going on a parade?
 Attention!
 Lieutenant Watson is proud of his medals.
 Why does anybody find this funny?
 Let’s see a show of hands, how many of you were mended by our excellent John?
 How many people he saved!
 It's good you came, John. Sit at any table, I'll join you.
 Captain.
 Captain!
 Captain Sholto!
 I, Lieutenant John Watson,
 in accordance with the laws and traditions of Her Majesty's Army,
 challenge you to a duel.
 As one officer to another.
 John, is this a joke?
 I also ask
 of anyone present here,
 the ones who know me well,
 to be my second for this duel.
 Quick, quick! Hurry, hurry, hurry!
 At least tell me what this is for?
 For the murder of the Indian boy.
 Indian?
 You want to kill me for an Indian?
 I just saved your life, or have you forgotten already?
 In case you did not know, I’ve killed 68 Indians with my bare hands.
 And for England's sake I would be willing to kill even more.
 As would all of the people present here. Isn't that so, gentlemen?
 Why did we fertilise India with the bones of our fellow soldiers?
 So they—those creatures—could come to England?
 They infiltrate everything here!
 They live in our houses, they trade on our markets,
 they slaughter their rams right on my street!
 They even dance and pray
 on our squares! Is this called tolerance?
 Is this what we were fighting for, John?
 Now the Queen wants to be kind.
 She builds hospitals and schools for them,
 so they can be literate. Why does a savage need to be literate?
 He doesn't need it to plough a field.
 The literate savage crawls right here, in England.
 He wants to clean toilets, wash our floors, and clean our shoes,
 and soon there will be more of them than us!
 Perhaps you don’t know, but every one of their families has ten to twelve people. They spawn like rats.
 And we are against this tolerance... and this fertility.
 The question is simple, John:
 either we conquer them,
 or they will conquer us.
 Gentlemen,
 who wants to be Lieutenant Watson's second in this duel?
 We are bringing civilisation to the East.
 We won’t allow our culture, our beliefs, and our traditions, all to be destroyed.
 We are Anglo-Saxons!
 It is our duty and our burden!
 The white man's burden.
 There are police out there.
 Open up! It's the police!
 In the name of Her Majesty, open this door!
 Hatred is your culture. The murder of women and children are your traditions.
 You are a scoundrel, Captain, and your patriotism is but your last refuge.
 In this case,
 I challenge you to a duel for the murder of Lieutenant Small.
 Show me your walking stick.
 Your stick, Sholto!
 You convinced your fellow veterans of this murder,
 and then you killed them as well, one after another.
 These were your fighting friends.
 These are casualties, gentlemen.
 They are inevitable, as you know.
 All of us are casualties.
 Who's willing to be my second?
 We need to break the door! They'll kill Watson!
 - Break the door!
- Break it!
- A ram! Quick!
 Hurry!
 Watson!
 You're just in time, gentlemen. Quickly, this way.
 Go!
 Don't move! It's the police!
 We had a friendly party and Mr. Sholto shot himself.
 And you are all witnesses, yes?
 - Yes.
- My dear officers.
 Watson, give me your gun.
 Where is your gun?
 I have Mr. Watson's gun.
 I'm an armourer, he asked me to check the peen.
 Sir.
 Who also has a weapon with them?
 Write this down:
 Suicide.
 I don't want to hear your tales anymore.
 The carriage was attacked by a gang of cabmen.
 They began a fight because of the treasure.
 Scotland Yard managed to neutralise them.
 And Sholto just shot himself.
 Right, Mr. Watson?
 Sholto was doing this on someone's order. He couldn't—
 The police have enough to deal with without your fantasies. Have a nice day.
 Gregson, let's go!
 You’ll be summoned if there’s a need.
 Oh, Holmes, thanks for your help.
 One thing in this case is still a mystery to me. Why did Irene Adler steal the photograph?
 Oh, I forgot I still had this. I was meant to give it to Lestrade.
 Are you mad? No way.
 Believe me, Small threw out all the treasure into the Thames.
 Do you know how much a single pearl is valued at?
 A hundred pounds in gold, no less. It's yours if you want it.
 I know who needs it more. Let's go!
 And on the way, John, I will tell you how I learned about your brother's death from this watch!
 Do you think children deserve to be told the truth?
 Here, Mary. These gentlemen have something to tell you.
 - Perhaps you ought to...
- Fine.
 Mary,
 Your father, Lieutenant Peter Small—
 Went to America.
 On the way, his ship got into—
 A storm, but—
 Everybody drowned.
 Almost.
 Your daddy survived.
 But why didn't he say goodbye before leaving?
 Because he didn't want to upset you.
 Right?
 Yes.
 Where are your scissors?
 - On my nightstand.
- Bring them.
 - Why, gentlemen?
- I couldn't.
 I couldn't.
 Doctor.
 Here.
 Daddy sent you a present.
 Now, don't look.
 We aren't looking.
 Close your eyes.
 And open.
 Do you like it?
 This is your future.
 And every year your father will send you one pearl,
 so you can live and study in this beautiful orphanage. We should go.
 - Yes.
- A cab is waiting.
 Yes.
 Sir, can I ask you something?
 Yes, of course.
 Can you play with me? Like Mr. Sholto did?
 Of course he can.
 How?
 Rock, paper, scissors.
 I will be counting.
 Rock, paper, scissors, and a bottle of lemonade, and a box of chocolates, and a plate of jam,
 and a screwdriver's also needed, pencil, fire, water, one, two, three!
 Rock, Paper, Scissors
