 Egeria* * Egeria was a nymph who was the wife or
the friend of pious king of Rome, Numa Pompilius.
She gave him wise advice at night.
So, it isn't only the prostitute's name
in that episode, it's also an allusion to
Atia's role. I was thinking... I was thinking... You and I might
go away to Baiae*. * Baiae is a town on the Bay of Naples, Italy,
very fashionable and luxurious
because of its medicinal warm sulfur springs.
Many rich and distinguished people
had villas in the area.
To make a nowadays comparison,
it would be like Ibiza or Monte-Carlo. After next market day. It's supposed to be nice there - and seeing how crowded it's been...
- That's a lovely idea, but... But what ? I can't leave Lyde alone.

 - She needs me.
- She needs you. Evander's been missing for two months.
Something bad has happened. Very likely something
bad has happened. Very likely he is dead ! Pullo, awake ! Wake up !
Mark Antony's waiting. Mump off and die,
you pigfucker. Right. Thank you,
my honey. You shouldn't thank slaves. - No harm in it.
- It's bad for discipline. Happy again this morning ? Niobe, then ? - How's she going ?
- I don't understand her.

 All the hoo over her
sister's damn husband. Women, eh ?
Maybe she's... She's... She's what ? I don't know.
Women, eh ? Mighty vice-conqueror of Gaul, Mars* and Bellona* swell
with pride at your doings. * Mars is the god of the war.
Bellona is sometimes his wife and
is also the goddess of the war
(her name comes from "bellum", "war"). - And I say...
- Oh, good Juno, what cac you speak ? Would you just get on
with your point, man ? Immediately, Your Honor.
I... Publius Servilius is here. Ah, good. That'll do
for this crowd then. - Off with you.
- I... No, off with you ! Master of horse* and
people's tribune Mark Antony * The Master of the Horse (Magister Equitum)
is an office appointed by dictator.
He reprents the dictator and has the same powers.
He has to dismiss when the dictator dismisses too,
after six months. will receive
your petitions tomorrow. Vorenus ! Out ! Cynthia, a pear, my love ? Servilius, my dear old friend. How are you ? Healthy healthy, I thank you. Forgive me,
have we met before ? Have we not ? No idea. I always pretend so
with civilians. It's more politic, nay ? And this must be your beautiful wife, whose name escapes me. Poppaea. A flower. You'll excuse all the bustle. I found Pompey's taste in decor rather dull. I like a little more color. As you say. You shall make it lovely,
we are sure. You'll forgive me if I talk
business with your husband ? Of course. Pretend I am not here. Impossible. But I shall try. Now then... I'm sure you're aware that Caesar Has left me in charge
whilst he is in Greece. Yes.
Off having fun chastising Pompey et al*. * et al = et alii = "and the others" Left me here to
scribble and quibble like a damned civilian. However, I am determined
to make the most of it. I shall be a good politician, even if it kills me. Or if it kills anyone
else for that matter. So you are, it seems, the most senior
senator left in Rome. I have that honor. - And a turnabout pompeian to boot.
- I... Which is why I thought it could be amusing if we made you consul
for this year. Consul ? That's most kind... Allow me to finish speaking. When the Senate next meets, there are a couple of legislative items I wish to see enacted immediately. I am sure you
will be happy to assist. - I... I...
- Item one : the Senate will ratify Caesar's election as your
co-consul* for the coming year. * There are two consuls each year.
Make Caesar a co-consul is just
for the sake of appearances, since Caesar
would take all the major decisions. But he is dictator in any case. It sounds so much better
if he is consul. It's more amicable. You got that ? - I... I do. I... I have...
- Item two : you will propose
the following law : forthwith, in every province of Italy, one third of all those employed at laboring with cattle or in agriculture must be freedmen or citizens. I don't understand. Too many slaves, you see ? They've taken all the work,
which causes unemployment amongst the free populace. Now, we need to create
more jobs for our citizens. But it will be hugely expensive ! It will. But only to those few rich men who own all the land. And they shall have the consolation of having done something
eminently patriotic. It seems rather... extreme to say the least. Ruinous even. You may well be right. But frankly, I do not care
whether it is the rich, poor, or, indeed both that suffer. Caesar wishes this law to be made. He is my friend,
I will have it made. If you prefer, I could always bypass the Senate, call an assembly of the people and you can put
your arguments to them. A fine orator like yourself
might just persuade them that Caesar is wrong. - That won't be necessary.
- Good. Good. That's it then. I don't know what to say. Say nothing then. It's often best. You know Posca of course, Caesar's creature ? He'll take all the details. Poppaea... My dove, if your husband
should die... come to me,
we will marry, neh ? So, keeping their promises,
isn't he ? What ? Caesar and Mark Antony,
doing right by the people. That was your worry, wasn't it ? That Caesar'd turn out to
be just another tyrant sort ? But here's him
and Mark Antony getting jobs
for the unemployed. You can't complain
about that now, can you ? He negotiates with a whore
and a dwarf at his side. Think you Cincinnatus*
or Marius or even the Grachii* Cincinnatus is a farmer twice dictator.
In 458 b.C. he strongly defeats the Aequi tribe
that menaces Rome. After his victory
he humbly goes back and ploughs his field.
Marius (157-86 b.C.) is a tribune (just like Caesar
and Mark Antony). He's elected consul and puts
king Jugurtha down, then Cimbers and Teutons.
The Grachii is the name given to two brothers
(Tiberius and Caius Sempronius Gracchus)
elected tribunes. They support and impose
reforms and laws favourable to the poor.
They're killed, one in -133 and the other in -121. - would demean themselves so ?
- Who ? Mark Antony has his odd ways,
there's no denying that. I'm not going home.
I need a drink. - Drink ? You ?
- I. Drink. What of it ? I'll not argue. - Ouch !
- Sorry. You need to calm down lately. How can I be calm ?
Two months of this. - Aren't you done yet ?
- Will you sit still ? Won't catch a pretty new husband
with a sour face like that. I don't want a new husband.
I want Crito. You can't stay
married to a drover, not now that your
father's a prefect. - It wouldn't be right.
- I told her. Far too low. Fortune blessed you,
you haven't paid out dowry. Don't worry, we'll find you
someone nice, and proper status. I don't want anyone ! You can't be unmarried.
It wouldn't be decent at your age. - Decent she says.
- What's that supposed to mean ? You know what it means. You hold your tongue. Or what ? What will you do ? It's all right, sweetie.
It's all right. I thought it was going
well for a while, but now... Maybe I should beat
her, do you think ? I don't know.
That only works if you keep at it. A good thrashing
once or twice a day till they're docile. But then they don't look so good. Be a shame to mark up
a beauty like her. She is, eh ? She's a beauty. She is that. Slaves, money, everything.
What do I get ? Nothing, that's what I get. A house full of wailing. My wife won't even couple with me. Why not ? Says she can't while her sister stays. What's her sister to do with it ?
What difference should that make ? What is wrong with her ? What is wrong with her ? What is wrong with me That I'm served this way ? You should leave her, maybe, seeing as she makes you so unhappy. No !
I will not leave her. I'd rather die than leave her. It's all right, lamb. It'll be all right. Who, I say, faced with the overwhelming force of the figures and the arguments
I have here marshalled could resist their
overwhelming conclusion ? Therefore I ask you, honored conscript fathers*, * Title to talk to the Senators
(Patres "fathers" because the Senate was
in older days a board of old men,
and conscripti because they are "registered"
on a list). to support me in
this important and... patriotic legislation which will... Does anyone wish to speak
against the motion ? No opposition voiced. No division required.
Motion carried. It's empty. It is... If there's no wine,
water will do. Thank you, my dove. So, Lyde, I was asking
around, you know, about your man there,
Evander. Asking around ? See if I could find
out anything for you. Only, I know a few
shady characters, see ? Types that might know what's what
when a man's gone missing. Anyroad,
they tell me that he got himself
into some trouble with some nasty Greek
boys across the river. Gambling debts, they say. Gambling ? Evander never gambled. Well, sure it's the sort of thing a man keeps quiet around
his wife, neh ? What are you saying ? I'm sorry to say it,
but it looks like he's not coming home. Dead, looks like. Are you sure ? So they tell me. Dead.
Killed. It isn't true. My advice, best forget about him. Best get on with your life. It isn't true. It's not so bad. You've still got
people that love you. Look to them, eh ? Isn't that right, Niobe ? Best she gets on with her life. Best she looks to
the people that love her. Forget Evander. Forget the past. Well, I'm away. Need a drop of wine
to set me up for the day. No ! Lyde, please don't. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. You're sorry ? It's too late
for sorry, isn't it ? You weren't sorry when you
were fucking him, were you ? You weren't sorry then.
I piss on your sorrow ! I will not shh.
You shh ! You're a thief and a whore
and you stole my husband ! I stole nothing ! He came to me ! He came to me !
I never loved him. I love my husband ! And if you'd done...
If you'd been... If I had done what ? If I had given him a child.
Is that it ? I am sorry.
Please forgive me. Please forgive me !
Forgive me ! I curse you, sister ! By grace of the Furies*,
I curse you. * They're allegories for Vengeance.
Their heads are wreathed with serpents
and their eyes full of blood.
They hunt the criminals and torture them
until they drive them mad (hence their name,
"Furor" in Latin means "madness"). I'll keep your secret for the sake of the child, but don't you ever... ever speak to me again. Be careful ! Bravo.
Bravo. A little blood lust
suits you, Octavian. You look very handsome.
Does he not ? He does. Titus Pullo is a good teacher. Well it's a pity Caesar isn't here. He'd put you on his staff
immediately. Perhaps you should go
and join him in Greece, get some real pompeian
blood on your sword. - Don't be silly, mother.
- Well why not ? If we are not quick, Pompey
and Cato and all those fools will be dead will be dead before Octavian
gets his chance to shine. He's still a child. I am not. He is not.
He is quite the little man now. I should think
there's more to manhood than swordplay. Octavian, have you penetrated anyone yet ? Mother, please. Does that mean you
have or you haven't ? Haven't, but... Titus Pullo, didn't I tell
you to sort that out ? I'm sure I did. I... Sorry, ma'am.
I'll see to it. Do that. Don't worry, darling.
There's really nothing to it. Once you're in the saddle,
as it were, it'll all come naturally.
Isn't that right, Pullo ? That's right ma'am. And none of your sordid soldier's
she-wolves, mind you. Something clean and pretty. Clean and pretty it is. Good. I'll get Merula
make you a toga. What else ? Perhaps you can arrange
he kill someone. That will happen in due course. We Julii always have
the needful enemies. Health to my child. My daughter. I wish for a son,
a healthy son. - I...
- Good night, then. Good night. Husband. What's all this ? I thought it might please you
if we had some time alone. I sent the girls
and Lucius to Clarissa. And Lyde ? She's gone to a friend's. - Please, sit down.
- I've already eaten. But... I can have some more. Excuse me. Sit down with me. That's all right. Really, sit. I can't finish all this on my own. The calendar is correct... If you would like
to have me tonight. I would. I'd like that. My dear Mark Antony, I hope this finds
you in better health than my hopes for victory. I chased Pompey from one
end of Greece to the other and he resolutely
refused to fight. I thought this was
his usual obtuseness, but the old man has
some sense left in him yet. While avoiding battle, he has gathered a good
10 legions from the East, and I find myself
badly outnumbered. Now the cat
barks at the dog, and Pompey is chasing me. I can outmaneuver
him for a while, but not forever. My men are tired
and ill-supplied, and we shall soon
have to stand and fight. I ask you to bring
the 13th here as speedily
as you are able. Damnation. Shall I summon
the legion legates* ? * legates = lieutenants No.
Wait. I must think on this. This is lovely. It's just your coloring. A little loud. I'd prefer something plainer. What's the point in plain ? We shall take it. But this one... Divine. Oh, divine. Antony will love this.
He likes me in Eastern* styles. * Discreet and ironical allusion
since Mark Antony likes so much
Eastern style that he'll become
Cleopatra's lover. - How much for both ?
- 5000. You are a thief. Four and a half then. Three. Can we afford such expense ? Things as they are
with Caesar in Greece, surely we should
be more prudent ? Don't worry out a thing,
my dear, I'm thinking ahead. Titus Pullo is here, dominus. Tell him I am unwell. He may come back
next week perhaps. Tell him nothing of the sort. Octavian will be ready to see him. in one moment.
And give him a purse. You've put off this moment - long enough, my dear.
- Mother... You will penetrate
someone today or I will burn your wretched
books in the yard. Off with you. Coming through. Noble coming through.
Make way there. Don't worry, young master. There's nothing to it. If there is nothing to it, why is
such a fuss made of the thing ? You'll soon find out. Vai, vai !
Be off with you ! This isn't no infantry fuckhole,
thank you very much. Now now, my honey,
calm your stomach. We've come for
the young master here. And we're well coined. Well, excuse me, of course. I meant no disrespect. We're honored to service
you, young master. And what would be
the young master's pleasure ? First-timer.
Nothing too savory. I'm sure we have
just the thing. Something exotic, perhaps ? Or else something young ? Light, simple. Little bit skinny, neh ? Won't know he's been, will he ? Won't know you've been. More substance, yet still nymphlike, graceful. This one's fresh off the boat... - That will be fine.
- Hold on, young master. No point hurrying. Big decision, this. - Let's have a look at...
- This one is perfectly adequate. You will be utterly satisfied,
I assure you. Egeria, go prepare yourself. If we might dispense
with the pecuniary details... Oh ! Right. What's your price then ? 1000. Gerrae* !
(* Bullshit !) I could have half the whores
in Narbo for that, and their mothers. We're not in Narbo,
whatever that might be. All right, my dove. We'll pay. But the girl better fuck him like
Helen of Troy with her ass on fire, or I'll know the reason why. Speak. Gnaeus Pompey Magnus
sends greetings. He hopes you find
his house satisfactory. It'll do. - Get to his point.
- His point. Caesar is doomed
and you with him, unless you make
a separate peace. And ? If you do, Pompey will
be merciful and generous. How ? He will give you your life.
A province. Money enough
to preserve your dignity. What makes him think
I value my life so high ? Why have you
not left for Greece ? Do not smile at me. Return tomorrow. I will give Pompey
his answer then. Not that way. And disguise yourself. Dismissed. You take clothes down ? That's an interesting accent. No understand. Where... are you from ? Where from... Don't know. You don't know where you're from ? Rome take me very young. Kill mother, father, brother, Take me. I see.
Sad. Turn over, would you ? On your hands and knees. Nice place, this. Clean. I don't suppose, seeing as I'm
with the quality... Not a chance. No no no.
No, do it for real. Fight. Come on, fight
damn you ! Fight ! That's better ! Good. Brava, Cynthia !
Brava ! Brava ! Don't be so silly,
it's just a scratch now. There. Yes, Posca, what's it ? I am to remind you of your dinner
tonight with Atia of the Julii. Sons of Dis*. * Dis (the Rich) is one of Pluto's names,
the god of the Underworld. Now, run along. Where is he ?
Where he'd be ? Busy man.
Politics. Politics ?
He promised he would come. Castor ! Send a man to Pompey's...
I mean, Mark Antony's villa and enquire his whereabouts. Antony's whereabouts,
immediately, domina. Do not say it is
I who sends to ask. Not you sends to ask. Stay. He'll know
it is I who asked. Send no one. I will send no one. If he comes,
he comes, I don't care ! Welcome, dominus. Sorry to be so horribly late.
Endless business. Will you forgive me ? Of course. I confess, I had quite
forgotten you were coming. So this is a lovely surprise. Excuse me a moment,
I will go and dress correctly. Here he is, young Apollo ! How was it ? It was pleasant. Pleasant ? I should say so. How was he ? Like bull. What's wrong ? Nothing. Tell me. Mark Antony does not intend
to go to Greece to help Caesar. I have sworn loyalty
to a man of no honor. Well you don't have
to go to Greece then. - We'll be together.
- It's true, but still. Haven't you always said
Caesar's cause is wrong ? That is not the point. There is a moral principle involved. What an idiot you are ! Not hungry ? After so many years of soldier's porridge,
I am easily sated. Well, these last news from Greece cannot have improved your appetite. Hardly. And is it really so bad ?
Caesar always finds a way to win. Pompey has gathered 10 men
for every one of Caesar's. Arithmetic has no mercy. I'd feared it was so. What do you intend to do then ? I don't know. You've become a powerful man.
The people love you. Only because
they don't know me. You could be the first man
in Rome, if you wanted. I hadn't thought about it like that. Well, you should. You should think about that. I'm thinking about
something entirely different. Water. I could sleep for a week. I've been thinking. We should get married. Married ? Why should we want
to do that of all things ? Perhaps I love you. You're joking. For a moment there
you had me worried. I'm not joking with you. Oh, my dear woman. Please, don't worry,
I'm not going soft on you. I'm thinking strategically. If Caesar is defeated,
I can't very well form an alliance with the pompeians. - I need protection.
- True. What's in it for me ? If Caesar is defeated... then I will be defeated also. Only if you join him in Greece. But if you stay in Rome, you will be very well situated. You have the people with you, you have possession of the city. You only lack money. And whilst your name
is perfectly respectable... - I am no patrician.
- Exactly. But allied with my house, you would have both
coin and nobility, to make yourself king
if you wished it so. And you would be queen. I would be your loving
and obedient wife. If only I were willing
to desert a friend. A man of your own blood. Too honorable for that, are you ? I like to appear so. But I don't think you'll die
for the sake of appearances. Will I not ? Caesar will die in any case. But you are far too clever
to share his fate needlessly. I had not realized until now... what a wicked old harpy you really are. Get out. Get out ! Thank you, Pullo. Hold on !
Attention ! Abed in daylight,
what luxury. Wickedness. Father ! That dwarf is asking for you. Excellency Mark Antony orders 13th legion to muster
on the Field of Mars*. * Area out of Rome for some assemblees,
civic meetings with weapons, and where soldiers
can train themselves. Why ?
Where are we going ? Greece. Tribune ! What shall I tell Pompey ? Of course. Excuse me.
I had forgot you. His skin is a little dry. Have him well-oiled
before he is presented. Bona dea. I am afraid to ask. Gifts for Servilia. How fine you look ! Let me see. I am so proud of you. You're a real man
at last, eh ? Why are we giving
gifts to Servilia ? The old crow stands in
well with Cato and the rest. When Caesar and his dog
Antony are defeated... If they are defeated. When they are defeated,
we'll need her good will. - And this will buy it, you think ?
- I do not see why not. A large penis
is always welcome. You think it's not enough ? After what you did to her ? What I did ?
What did I do to her ? Please !
I'm not stupid. It was you made
Caesar renounce her. Well, what if I did ?
She doesn't know it. Does she not ? She's not stupid either. Servilia has no guile in her.
If she knows it, we would certainly
have heard about it. You know best. I'm sure. In any case, you will
take the gifts to her and see what she's thinking. She's always been very fond of you. And you will go to Mediolanum*. * Milan. - Timon will take you.
- Mediolanum ? Yes, they have a very
good academy there. - I don't understand.
- You're a man now. Rome's not safe
for men of the Julii. His toenails are ugly. Have them cut and painted
and put some flowers on his head. And send over some ice.
Six barrels, say. Six barrels of ice. Well, don't look so foolish. I know what I'm about. Your mother's too kind. To what do I owe this generosity ? It's a gesture of friendship. Friendship. Thank your mother
for her... friendship. I hope one day
to reciprocate her... friendship. Good. Excuse me. Wait. Please, forgive my ill humor. There's nothing to forgive. I have known you since
you were a little girl. You have a good soul. I know that whatever
others might do, you are blameless. I know that. I... I do not...
That is, I cannot... It's all right.
There's no need. Tell your mother that I am grateful
for the gifts and that I treasure her
friendship as always. You must come and visit
me again. Will you ? I will. Promise ? I want there to be no
ill feeling between us. I promise. Be a good girl. Do as you're told. I'll wait
for you outside. Bellona protect you. And Juno* keep you. * Juno is a goddess protecting married women. A fleet of ships has set sail for Greece carrying the army
of general Mark Antony. This month's public bread is provided by the Capitoline
brotherhood of millers. The brotherhood uses
only the finest flour. True Roman bread, for true Romans. This is cack, this is !
I'm wet through. We're perfectly safe. A very good offering was made to Triton*. * Triton is a sea deity,
son of the sea, Neptune. If Triton can't keep me drier than this,
he can suck my cock ! Why can't you learn to
keep your fat mouth shut ?! Subtitles by Raceman and Haynee
