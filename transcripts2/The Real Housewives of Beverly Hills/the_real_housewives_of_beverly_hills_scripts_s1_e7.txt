 kyle richards: you're such a [beep] liar, camille. [intense music] [theme music] taylor armstrong: it may look like I have it all. but I want more. lisa vanderpump: in beverly hills, it's who you know. and I know everyone. adrienne maloof: money is what I have, not who I am. kim richards: I was a child star. but now my most important role is being a mother. kyle richards: in a town full of phonies, i'm not afraid to be me. camille grammer: it's time for me to come out of my husband's shadow and shine. [music] you'll see. come on. kyle richards: carina? - Hey. kyle richards: hi. hey, kyle. how are you? nice to see you. - You, too. mwah. it's good to see you. good to see you, too. this is my sister, kim. kim richards: hi. nice to meet you. kyle richards: so in the limo in new york, kim decided that we should all find dates for her. so I thought that we should be giving her a little makeover before we went on this man mission. she doesn't normally like to do these kinds of things. that's so exciting. so she might be a little intimidated by what are going to do. But-- it's going to look good. very healthy. kim richards: ok. and younger looking skin. kim richards: ok. kyle richards: that's what we like. ok. get naked. just-- [laughter] are you naked? oh my god. No. you're not going to be naked. - Oh ok. come on in. love you. where were we now? carina does this facial that is not like any other facial I've ever had. it's tightening the muscles in your face. it's the closest you can get to a facelift without the surgery. this does not feel like a facial. kim, I'm telling you. you're going to be gorgeous. [laughing] kim richards: oh my god, kyle. when I turn the electricity on, you will, uh, feel-- wait. what do you mean? carina: a tingling sensation. what are you talking about? kyle richards: it's going to taste weird in your mouth. like what? kyle richards: your mouth is going to taste like metal. well, what are you doing? this electric current will stimulate the face muscles. kim richards: uh huh. and also push the product that's in the cotton into your dermis. ok? [zap] did you feel it? no. i feel these little-- oh. carina: are you comfortable? well-- as comfortable as-- whatever you want to call comfortable. kyle richards: listen. we have to suffer for beauty. you're going to thank me for this one day. kim richards: kyle, when she was younger, was like my baby. i took care of her. over the years, she's become protective over me. because I'm the single parent, maybe alone. and it's become a little bit of a different relationship. kyle richards: have you ever asked a guy on a date? or do you wait to be asked? - Oh no. yeah. i, I've approached. kyle richards: you have? kim richards: I wouldn't say I'm looking today. i'm one of those people that believe if it's going to happen, it's going to happen. i'm not out driving around in my car looking over the-- oh. you know, I think I felt at this point in my life, i was hoping that there would be no more worries. you know? like, my kids would be a certain age. and I wasn't going to have-- Like, my worries would be over. and now, like, what? i gotta worry about wrinkles. i gotta worry about my nose. my kids. i want everything just to be good. i want to have a person that I can lay next and go-- kyle richards: she needs your husband, carina. carina: yeah. That's all. kim richards: he's got to be somebody fun. kyle richards: yeah. Kim richards: somebody's loyal. kyle richards: well, this all sounds great. but it's never who you pick. [laughing] kim richards: my kids are all at a point and an age now where, if Mr. Right did come along, I would do it. you have to admit. look at this. yeah. i know. it does look good. it feels like new skin. move over. kyle richards: kim needs to find someone that can be her best friend, that they share the same interests. like mauricio and me. if she doesn't find a husband or a soulmate or someone to spend the rest of her life with, then I am going to be worrying about her until the day I die. and I don't want to do that. magic. i love it. [music] yes this looks yummy. do you know how martin likes it? do you remember? staff: yeah. lisa vanderpump: okey doke. pinky? in here. hey, you. - Hey. how's it going? - Good. how are you? good. ooh, beautiful day. you've been smoking. i just had one in the car on the way up. oh, for god's sake. is there something wrong with you? would you want tea or coffee? - coffee, please. - Ok. ken's out there. oh. i'll be out in a second. martin has been a friend of ken and I's for 22 years. i would say he's probably ken's best friend. ok. which one do you want? i know which one you're going to want. you're going to want that, aren't you? uh, yeah. probably. a small piece of it. for sure. - Ok. all right. So what's going on? anything good? yeah. it's been busy today. has it? what? showing houses? had a few showings this morning. and then I had to go to a client's office for a meeting. hi. stick it there. oh, really? had to drop some paperwork off. and then I came here. all right. i thought, because you know how successful I've been in the past when I set you up-- when you've set me up? [laughter] lisa vanderpump: yeah. - Yeah. it worked out really well the last time-- ken todd: look, look at him. he's like-- lisa vanderpump: ok. martin is kind of going through, I don't know, hundreds of women. dating and playing the game. but I think he would really like to meet somebody special. i want to set you up with kyle's sister, kim. kyle's sister? you like kyle. kyle's lovely. I know. I've never met her sister, I don't think. have i? - No. she's not like kyle. she's different. you know how you love those kind of tall brunettes? oh yeah. Is she like a tall-- lisa vanderpump: she's not it. [laughter] she's a shorter blonde. and you know how you don't want children? exactly. she's got four. she's got four children? yes. has she got any other hobbies? lisa vanderpump: no. holy moly. lisa vanderpump: I think kim should be dating. i think it's probably time. i see that that's a gap in her life. should she get married again? i don't know. she's tried it three times. maybe she's not much good at it. she's really nice. isn't she? really nice. lisa vanderpump: but she's, she's a little feisty. a little feisty? she's short and feisty? lisa vanderpump: she's not short and feisty. she's just shorter than you normally go for. she's, um, short and feisty. oh, pinky. lisa vanderpump: and you're desperate now. aren't you? [laughter] you know what I mean? so I think it should work well. what do you think? mohamed's dinner on thursday? a very dear friend of mine wants to have a dinner for me. i think it would be the perfect setting for kim and martin to meet. it's a proper full-on date. lisa vanderpump: so you've got two or three days to go to the gym. stop smoking. [laughter] stop drinking. apart from that-- just be yourself. lisa vanderpump: you're in good shape. [laughter] exactly. martin genis: all right. we'll give it a try. why not? [music] kennedy armstrong: this is the wrong doctor. taylor armstrong: I don't think so. this is Dr. Jay's office. hi. how are you? receptionist: hi, kennedy. we are to see Dr. Jay today. ok. taylor armstrong: kennedy is waking up in the morning with her eyes literally sealed shut. she seems to be allergic to something. hi. hi, kennedy. good afternoon. what can I do for you today? well, kennedy got a puppy for her birthday. and since then, her eyes have been pretty red. especially I've noticed in the morning, they're almost sealed shut. it's like there's some fluid. dr. Jay gordon: are they sealed shut every morning? pretty much every morning. dr. Jay gordon: really? taylor armstrong: and, um-- what's the puppy's name, kennedy? snowball. dr. Jay gordon: oh, look. it's a great dane. [laughter] taylor armstrong: I've also noticed that she's got some rashes on her arms here. and she holds the puppy a lot. right there. taylor armstrong: so i'm just wondering if there's a correlation or-- yes. there is. i just want to look at your eyes a little. look up a little higher. not a big deal. and not really that enlightening. look up high. let me look at your nose, please. also not a big deal. but-- taylor armstrong: I just don't know what we're going to do. because we're very attached. i think we might also be very allergic, in addition to being very attached. taylor armstrong: it's not like I'm am happy that the doctor said that kennedy is allergic to the dog. but it is a little karmic. because I had told russell no dog. you have only one really good solution. and that's the dog can get another home. taylor armstrong: I'm at a loss as a mother. i mean, having to take her first pet away from her is a heartbreaking concept. i blame russell. i just can't believe he's done this. we're all going to take deep breaths now, kennedy. this is terrible. narrator: coming up. keep your eyes closed. they're closed. come on, man. just, just do it. just don't knock me into a door or something. open your eyes. [gasp]. [music] kim richards: could we get a table for two? host: ok. i'll put you over here. awesome. are you looking at your ? no. i saw you looking down for a text. kimberly: I'm not. ok. mhm. nope. i do not know what to get. i get so nervous. i know. how about when you eat, when they give you the wrong food and you get upset when I send it back? because it's scary. kim richards: why? because I just feel bad. they, like, made it. i don't want-- do you think that they want to eat something you don't enjoy? they want you to enjoy it. like, I get what you mean. but it just scares, I feel bad. i used to, I think, when I was younger. my relationship with kimberly is a little different. she'll pull me aside and just say, i just need to talk to you, and tells me how it is. something's on your mind. something's on my mind? mhm. kim richards: so in new york, I decided, since everybody thought I had such bad choices in men, pick somebody. let's see what you've got in mind. i was kind of kidding. but lisa already found somebody for me. kimberly: I know it's hard just because you're, like, by yourself. it's hard on us, too. you know? to see you go through all the things you go through. and like, we can't do anything about it. and like, I know that you want somebody. kim richards: I think my kids are kind of iffy about me dating again. kimberly: when I was younger, when you dated people, i felt like they were trying to, like, take you away almost. and so, like, I said, terrorised them. you terrorised one. a couple. and it was fun. it was fun to throw the cheeseburger in randy's face? that was an accident. kim richards: that was fun. it was an accident. kim richards: my kids have to like who I'm with. if one of my kids didn't like the person, then that would be a definite no for me. it's got to be a family decision. where are you at now? if I ever decide-- kimberly: I think that, if you dated somebody now, i'd be fine with it. just because, like, now I have, like, my own life. i want you to have your own, too. but I don't want to lose this. Kimberly: that's selfish of me. you won't. we won't. kim richards: I love you. kimberly: I love you, too. kim richards: it is time for me to start dating. i'm going for it. hello? i'm still here. hello? uh huh. kimberly: no, please.

I've got it. look at that. wait a minute. so how do we do this? adrienne maloof: that is lovely. that's grilled halibut. paul nassif: whoa. it's not that hot. oh my, you're so dramatic. it's extremely difficult to shop for a woman who has everything. i have a surprise for you. [door bell] i want you to come right outside in the hallway here. one year, he gave me a purse. it actually looked like a champagne bottle. and I don't know what he was thinking or who talked him into it. but plain and simple, it was hideous. paul nassif: but you're going to have to close your eyes. so here. seriously? grab my arm. close, you have to completely close. no. close them. cover-- no. Cover your hands, too. because I don't trust you. i'll close my eyes. cover your hands. i don't know about this one. this is like the blind leading the blind. keep your eyes closed. come on, man. they're closed. just do it. just don't knock me into a door or something. [music] narrator: coming up. hopefully with martin, though, she'll be on her best behaviour. Yeah. he's a pretty funny guy. yeah? can he hold his own? does he have to hold his own? that's why he's meeting kim, isn't it? he doesn't have to. [laughter] [music] adrienne maloof: ok. I've got to look at the-- paul nassif: no. you can't look. I've got you. you're fine. Just keep walking. - no. - Keep walking. i'll tell you when there's a step. i don't think it's really that difficult to shop for me. he's just got to think. and open your eyes. [gasp]. oh my gosh. hi. oh my god. how beautiful. oh my gosh. wow. paul nassif: hi. i love the dog. if I could, I would have a house full of dogs. paul nassif: this is a female. that's why. i give myself kudos for pulling this one off. because she was really, really surprised. and she loved the gift. wow. oh my gosh. paul nassif: and she's got good bite. she's got a good everything. it's very difficult to find the right kind of dog for us. going through the breeding and the background of the dog, the training, and the family tree. the right dog was in germany. so we had to ship the dog out. wow. this is the best gift I've ever had. paul nassif: so-- seriously. adrienne maloof: it's actually, this time, exactly what I wanted. a dog doesn't talk back. he's always loyal. you know, he's your best friend sometimes. philippa reaver: paul worked really, paul worked very hard on this. i'll tell you. do I get a hug? thank you. oh my gosh. wow. paul nassif: the night came off exactly as I hoped. it was flawless. let's go play with the dogs. [music] taylor armstrong: it's nice out. isn't it? doesn't it look great out here with the new accessories? this couch just-- taylor armstrong: yeah. it's an outdoor couch. isn't that cool? looks pretty nice to be outdoors. it's nice. that's the point. i'm really struggling with this whole snowball issue. you asked me about getting kennedy a dog. and I specifically told you that she wasn't ready. and now she's allergic to the dog. she's really allergic. well, she does seem to be getting better. so-- taylor armstrong: I blame russell. seeing my child getting sick, it was making me more frustrated with russell day by day for purchasing a dog against my wishes. russell armstrong: I mean she doesn't seem to be, to be getting congested any longer. so-- taylor armstrong: these rashes on her arm, i'm really concerned that when she gets older, if she has these rashes for 13 years, and if she's got this congestion happening all the time. and so, just hear me out for a second. and you, you truly believe this is all being caused by the dog? well, I took her to see Dr. Gordon. and he said 100% it's from the dog. he said we needed to get rid of the dog. well, I don't want to give the dog away. taylor armstrong: no one wants to give the dog away. but at the same time, the alternative for kennedy is either medication for the next 13 years or allergy injections. and we're not going to give her shots in order to keep a puppy for half of her life. we've got a big decision to make. i'm very concerned about having to get rid of her first family pet and traumatising her. but I should never have been put in this situation. the last thing I want to do is take a dog away from her. i feel horrible for her. well, I know kennedy is not going to be happy about this. i mean I don't want her to lose anything in her life. but at the same time, I'm not going to let her be sick and have allergies over an animal. we have to handle this very gently. [music] anxiety. i'm going on a date. [phone rings] lisa vanderpump: (on phone) hello? kim richards: well, i'm getting ready. i was thinking, tell me a little bit about tonight. what, who is this guy? lisa vanderpump: (on phone) um, tonight, I'm setting you up with a debonair young man. well, he's not debonair. but he's the best I could find. ok? i don't want you to get too cocky tonight. he's fine. he's age appropriate darling. ok. being that I don't think anybody's going to knock on my door today and say, hey, want to go out tonight? i don't think I have a big choice right now. what is his name again? lisa vanderpump: (on phone) no. i'm not telling you his name. you're not googling him and doing all that stuff. oh, come on. lisa vanderpump: (one phone) it's a blind date. you know what that is? you're going in blind. going on the blind date and, first of all, not knowing who he was and everybody being there? it was really, like, kind of nerve wracking. lisa vanderpump: (on phone) bye. you better do me well. [music] kyle richards: what's that you're putting in my hair? this is really flexible hold. kyle richards: that's what I use in sofia's hair. it's not crunchy hair stuff. not at all. mauricio and I have met martin a few times. i like martin. i think he could be a good match for kim. i hope she's on her best behaviour. this could be really ugly, or really cute. no. It's beautiful. i'm scared. taylor armstrong: oh my goodness. what do you think I should wear, big guy? this is kind of fun. sparkly. you like sparkly? i'm still upset with russell about the dog. but I'm going to put it behind me today and put on a happy face and go to the party. because that's what I do. No. no, no, no. It's not a toy. not a toy. this is for peepee. ok? [music] lisa vanderpump: mohamed is really well known in beverly hills and has absolutely fabulous parties. so I was thrilled when he said he wanted to have a dinner for me. mohamed's latest house is four times the size of mine. in fact, it makes mine look like a shack. it's 60,000 square foot, which is huge. mohamed? and I felt pretty amazing. i was wearing this dress that I bought in paris. hey. lisa. how are you? you look amazing. lisa vanderpump: there's nothing better to take the wind out of your sails than being greeted by a 25-year-old, six foot supermodel as I kind of waddle down the hall behind her. oh, it looks beautiful, mohamed. ken todd: stunning. well done, mohamed. lisa vanderpump: the gardens are beautiful. the view. i mean, it's the perfect place to have a dinner party.

Good health. you must say hi to everyone. well, they're not going to leave us alone now. are they? no. let me go and say hello. kim richards: I think everybody was just kind of staring and kind of waiting to see what martin and I were going to do and how were we doing. and it put a lot of pressure on me. i was definitely nervous and tense. you know my brother-in-law, martin. ken todd: he's always wanted a family. [laughter] [music] kyle richards: martin, what happened to your date? ken todd: she shrank. kyle richards: kim disappeared for quite a bit. and I started thinking, please tell me she didn't leave. [music] next time we go to a party like this, on a blind date, i'm going to put her on a leash with a dog cone around her neck. lisa vanderpump: but where has she gone? i mean, did she? she wouldn't do that. kim, my friend, can be a little unpredictable. so I'm thinking, has she gone in search of a better offer? she's just gone to the bathroom. mohamed: we don't know which bathroom, though. there are only 17. normally, they're gone by the appetiser. what did you say, martin? darling. oh, please. we are-- we're going to the guest room. he said, may I have a chat with you for a moment? martin genis: every time I have a date, they hear the french accent and they're off. kim richards: well, you know what? your accent is pretty cute, too. martin genis: well, it's not french, though. is it? It's only english. kim richards: it's english. I like english. martin genis: and roger, he's got that suave french thing. i was walking back. and he said, may I walk you back to your seat? i feel so torn. [laughter] he said, welcome, darling. [laughter] you need to turn around and forget it. but this is not the right size. martin genis: he said it's not the right size. i say, yeah. It's too big. [laughter] kyle richards: that's very rude. kim richards: there were other cute men there. but I really liked, I really liked mohamed's-- i mean, not mohamed. i really liked martin's personality. do you like vegetables? not a lot. i hate vegetables. peas are the only vegetable I eat. me, too. we have peas in common. cedric: they're like two peas in a pod already. [laughter] let me high five myself. high five, cedric. kim richards: ok. i'm going to use the ladies' room really quick. and then I'm going to let you all talk about me-- martin genis: do you know where it is? no. Do you want to take me? martin genis: yeah. I'll show you. because you can get lost here very easily. he walked me to the ladies' room. he's just very much a gentleman. let their imaginations run wild. exactly. just to the left there. kim richards: my type is somebody that's kind, that's a gentleman. she seems like a very nice girl. lovely. yes. i think you look great together. i think you'll make a great couple. martin genis: here she comes. did you want another soda water or something? i think I'm good right now. martin genis: more wine? maybe, I'll have a tonic water in a moment. i think there is potential with martin. you kind of feeling a vibe? you like him a little? kim richards: I do. i think he's very handsome. taylor armstrong: all right. he seems very elegant. yeah. so it's a to be continued? kim richards: yeah. this could be-- kyle richards: the beginning. beginning of a beautiful relationship. i see spark going on. yeah. martin genis: well, thank you for your blessing, mohamed. i appreciate it.

[music] mauricio, we need you for a minute. i'm busy right now. Do you mind? paul nassif: how come you guys are very close together in the lower part of your bodies? when I see how affectionate mauricio and kyle are, i wish that russell and I were more like that. i don't know why we can't be like that. so the first how many years were challenging? i think the first-- first four years? - even longer. - It was? yeah. because you know, we're having babies. and you're pregnant. and you're tired. and when we were younger, if something upset me, we would be-- now I'm, like, oh please. who has the time to fight about that? [music] looks like it's working. kyle richards: my husband is like, yes. fine. i think, I think that they've got it going on right now. i saw them taking off-- now you have to go off with someone. i saw them going off together. and they're like, they got a little mojo going on. that's so awkward. Isn't it? i'm feeling a little-- [laughter] so this is your first date together? it's our first meeting together. paul nassif: your meeting. i like the way you said that. paul nassif: is it a date or is it a meeting? martin genis: it's not really a-- paul nassif: why don't you call it a date instead? i don't want to call it a date, per se. that's too much pressure. this is our first meeting together. the first time we've met. get to know each other a little bit. and how's it going? kim richards: well, I'm not, like, five 12 and brunette. five 12. that would make you six foot three. [laughter] paul nassif: that's six feet. martin genis: no. kim richards: I heard he only likes, like, really tall, tall brunettes. yeah. but you're hot. who wouldn't want you? kim richards: oh my god. I love you. martin genis: see? he knows. he knows how to flatter a woman. he's very clever. and it's true. you two have met tonight. and you guys have good chemistry together. he's the third person that said that. i know. isn't that amazing? who knows? kim richards: oh, I forgot to tell you. i married my first blind date. [music] taylor armstrong: on purpose. [laughter] nice to see you two. thank you very much for having us to your beautiful home. thank you very much. thank you so much. it was such a beautiful evening. lisa vanderpump: thank you, darling. muah. thank you. lisa vanderpump: evening was beautiful. just magical. and I think us girls needed that. kim richards: oh, love you. ken todd: love you, too. look after my buddy. don't do anything I wouldn't do. i would never do anything you would do. lisa vanderpump: I think this has gone quite well. i can't be sure. because she was kind of missing in action for a little while. but I think she likes him. i'm hopeful. and he's driving her home. so I'm not, I'm not saying anything. but I will have a full report in the morning. narrator: coming up. do you feel like he's your good friend? i feel like we're great business partners. lisa vanderpump: ok. we're going to see. oh, wow. taylor armstrong: I don't know. but I may need a drink for it. lisa vanderpump: I mean, I love a laugh. so I said, cedric, why don't you go down and check out the turkish bath? it's just very private down there. nobody will see you. have you seen it? taylor armstrong: lisa loves to play practical jokes, especially with cedric as the butt of them. lisa vanderpump: cedric-- Taylor armstrong: oh my. lisa vanderpump: what are you doing in here? who does that at a party? who does that? that's an exhibitionist. nice to see you. anyway, you need to pull your sock down there. that's a very large-- wow. [laughs] lisa vanderpump: I was very disappointed to see that, under all that dynamite, there's, like, a two inch fuse. je ne sais pas. au revoir. paul nassif: kim, spank him. kim richards: what? I-- paul nassif: spank him. [laughter] [music] hello, darling. hi. how are you? you look gorgeous, as always. thank you. you do. taylor armstrong: what a pretty top. of all the ladies, kyle really has a marriage that I admire. what's going on with you? i didn't want a dog for kennedy yet. because she's not ready. and now it turns out she's allergic. i said, you know, my friend, she doesn't have any little kids. and she doesn't have a husband. she doesn't have a dog. she's not going to care, taylor. she goes, well, we can give her daddy. [laughter] that's a good idea. [laughter] taylor armstrong: you know the beginning of a relationship when you feel like, oh you like vanilla ice cream? that's my favourite, too. oh, you like to go to mexico? that's my favourite place, too. - Right. taylor armstrong: and you go like, we're just meant to be. and then as your marriage grows, you start to realise all the ways that you're different. - Right. taylor armstrong: and all of the things that you don't provide for each other that you lack. but there's also times when you just want to, just want to scream. [music] we're so disconnected. and I don't know what to do to bring it back together. do you feel like he's your good friend? i feel like we're great business partners. i don't know how long it takes before you have a really good friendship in a marriage. i mean, when you and mauricio first got married, you know, in the first five years, were you great friends? yeah. otherwise, I wouldn't have married him. i always feel like he has my back, no matter what. i feel like he's my biggest fan. taylor armstrong: when I meet a big fan, i don't really know if it's ok for me to need that. of course, you need that. we all need that. taylor armstrong: you know i'm just kind of hoping that, that we're going to grow. i keep thinking, well, we're going to grow into that. you know, where it just is, is constant, unconditional approval. kyle richards: usually, you would have that as a foundation to begin with. i mean, because there's going to be so many rough patches through your life. you know? going through different problems and stuff. if you don't have that to begin with, that's hard. if you don't have that and you can't change that, what would you do? i don't know. because there's a part of me that feels like it's even unfair of me to ask for that. kyle richards: that's not true. that's not true. he's so lucky to have you. he really is. and you shouldn't feel that you don't deserve to ask for that. we all deserve to have it all. you know? you should expect everything. anybody would be lucky to have you. we'll see. narrator: next time on "the real housewives of beverly hills." kyle richards: my husband would really be tortured if I finish the race and he couldn't. lisa vanderpump: cedric and I need to get our american driving licences. oops, my shirt is undone. what if the instructor is not a boob man? lisa vanderpump: it's the only chance I have. one, two, three. wow. very good. are you thinking about someone on that? i'll never tell. i'm still horrified at the things that kyle said to me. i think she was out of control. men punch each other in the eye. and it's over. boom. narrator: to learn more about the housewives,
