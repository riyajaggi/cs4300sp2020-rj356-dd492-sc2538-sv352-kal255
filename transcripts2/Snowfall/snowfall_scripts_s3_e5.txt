 What are you suggesting? You and me, we at war. - Your men ready to roll, Sergeant? - Yes, sir, Lieutenant. Let's go. Hook 'em and book 'em! --Do not move! - Get your hands off... Fuck you! You need to be thinking about how you're gonna handle Andre. I know how this feels. How bad you must want to get back. But you can't kill no cop.

You didn't think that's worth mentioning? I didn't want to trouble you with it. Oh, that's very considerate of you, thank you. They found a fucking Uzi on one of your guys. That tends to get people's attention. This the business we in, Reed. I've come to learn that shit's just gonna happen. You familiar with the Dade County shootout? Few years ago, Miami. Cubans, Colombians decided they were gonna shoot it out midday in a crowded shopping center. Now, the cops found an armored car disguised as a party truck, assault weapons, ammunition all over the parking lot. And it changed everything because it brought the federal government out in force. That was the beginning of the end of the easy cocaine days - in South Florida. - Yeah, but... Come on, man, it was one Uzi. You're overthinking this shit. Am I? Yeah. You know the cop that led the raid, Sergeant Wright? He's trying to get your case file unsealed. Hmm. He's from my neighborhood. Known him my whole life. Things have got a bit personal lately, - but again, I'm handling it. - How? Seems it might be better if you didn't know. Look, you can be involved if you really want.

Ain't nothing going through no goddamn Inglewood... without Skully. Skully. And? And we ain't got no connections with Skully. Well, we kind of do. - Shut up, nigga. - What? - Nigga, we do. - What you talking about, Fatback? Manboy. His sister is Skully's baby mama. They stay in The Bottoms. Well, ain't that something. Leon, I need you to link up with Manboy, - go handle that shit. - Hell no. Hey, that shit with Wanda's been dealt with. Okay? I ain't asking you to be that nigga's best friend, but this is business, and I need you to handle this shit. - All right? - All right. Good. All right, that's it for now. Let's make this money. - Hey, nephew. Hey, man. Let me talk to you for a minute. Can it wait? Got to go see my moms, man, already late. Okay. How you feeling? Looks worse than it is. Go on, man. All right. - I'm-a talk to you later. - Yeah. Come in when you're done, Sergeant. It's not a good look, - Sergeant. - The only thing that makes sense is that she drugged me. So what do you know about this broad? - You ever seen her before? - Can't say I have. What kind of drugs were you two taking? What? No, I wasn't taking drugs. I was drugged. Right. Right, sorry. But, unfortunately, I'm gonna have to bump this up to I.A. - I.A.? For this? - Yeah, I'm afraid so. My hands are kind of tied on this one. If people see me making exceptions for the big TV star, I mean, how's that gonna look? Mmm. - Hold up. You're not eating? - I'm not hungry. You worried about the raids? The shit that happened with Jerome? I don't want to talk about that. You know, all I'm saying is we good. You know, there's nothing that connects us. What did I say? All right. Let's talk real estate, then. Huh? You find out who outbid us on that property? I did. And you're not gonna believe it. Where have you been? I called the department. - Nobody knew where you were. - I'm sorry, I... I'm fine. I was just with the guys. - All night? - Yeah. I had a few too many and didn't want to drive, so I slept on Nix's couch. Daddy, it's 1:00 in the afternoon. You couldn't call me? I know, and I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. I thought something happened to you. If I had done something like this, you would've lost your mind, -had the whole department looking for me. - Because you're a child. And I'm the man of the house, and I don't need to be - interrogated in my own home. - Well, excuse me for worrying. --A-Are you hungry? You want me to fix you something to eat? No. I just need to get some sleep. Uh... You know you left your bag sitting on top of the car. Oh, shit. ♪ ♪ You want to put your eyes back in your head? Send them in. Mr. Tulfowitz will see you now. Thank you. Well, there she is. Hello, Cissy. --Hello, Arnold. Franklin, good to see you, son. Whoa. It's been a while. Have a seat. Have a seat, please. Please, sit down. So... to what do I owe the pleasure? We want to talk to you about the property on South Avalon. - Really? - Yeah. We're hoping you might rescind your offer. You two were hoping I might rescind my offer? - Mm-hmm. - Why would I do that? Money, of course. We'll make it worth your while. You were the other bidder. You were why I paid 40K over asking. Son of a bitch. And here I was thinking you were coming in to beg for your old job back. No. I work for myself now. Well, good for you. Look, we're willing to cut you a check for $50,000 - just to walk away. - 50 grand, huh? Arnold, we have a vested interest in the property. We'd like to build up the community. Provide decent housing for low income families. Well, that's very commendable, but if you want it so bad, why didn't you just make a better offer? We would have. It was a timing issue. Timing, yeah. Timing's everything, - isn't it? - Look, just name your price and you can walk away with a chunk of change for doing nothing. Did you guys win the lottery - or something? Is there a-a rich uncle you didn't know about? - Something like that. - Well, uh, I wish I could help you, Cissy, I really do, but this-this property, it-it means a lot to me, too. You know, you're not the only ones who care - about the black community. - Yeah. You're a real man of the people. What's that supposed to mean? I love the blacks, you know that. Arnold, I worked for you for a long time. Long enough to know all about the payoffs to Building & Safety, the asbestos, the mold that you just painted over. You know as well as I do, those buildings are a lawsuit waiting to happen. Well, sweetheart, if you know me so well, then you know, uh, I don't take too kindly to threats. And I don't care how much money you've made snatching hubcaps, or dealing smack, or whatever it is that you people are involved with. You will never make enough money to muscle me out of a fucking deal! Now get the fuck out of my office. Franklin. - Think that'll do it? - Absolutely. - I like his new wig. How many drinks did you have? - I don't know. A few. - How often do you drink? Not often. Just special occasions, huh? Whose decision was it to go to the hotel? Mine. Was there any money exchanged? No, she wasn't a prostitute. You sure about that? Hey, there's no need for that. Guys, this was a setup. I was targeted. That woman, she drugged me. The tox screen will prove it. Targeted? By who? I just said it, man, the woman. Is there anybody else who might have reason to come after you? I don't know. I lock up a lot of bad people. Are you aware that you're named in three active lawsuits against the department? Property damage, excessive force. One of them claims that you held a woman without cause for 24 hours. Says that she had to piss in a wastebasket - while she was in your custody. - That was a mistake. Some might call it a civil rights violation. This is bullshit. I didn't do anything wrong. Steve. Are you gonna do something or are you just - gonna sit there and watch? - Yes. Can we please keep the questions limited to the case at hand? Damn. I'm a good cop. Just ask anybody. Sergeant Wright. We're just trying to get a clear picture of who you are. Unfortunately, there seems to be a pattern of questionable behavior here. We need to take a look at that. Watch my motherfucking door, nigga.
