 -[straining]: Help... -Matt? Hey, what hurts? -My, um... -He's having a heart attack. TEDDY: I'll hire help for both of you. COLONEL: What is so important that you can't clean up your own mess? Certainly isn't looking after your own family. The DEA is on a rampage down in Colombia. Thought you was immune to that shit. I don't know what it is you think you know, but I am the only reason that you are breathing free air right now.

 12 units, all two-bedroom, one-bath. FRANKLIN:We make an offer, it'll be cash. -This is the place. -JULIA: We don't work together anymore. We're certainly not married anymore. TEDDY: This thing blows up, you won't be touched. But you let it be known to whoever is behind this that I am not afraid to make noise if I have to. And I have product that I need to get across the border. I was hoping to use Lucia's family farm -and their routes. -Lucia's gone. She left months ago. Manboy here to see y'all. -Fuck you want here? -I'm a businessman. It'd be in my interest to know what the competition up to.

 Couple of my associates took that notion a little too far. What, are you trying to rob us? MANBOY: You'll give me a chance to square us, if I get my product from y'all. ANDRE: Now, this rock that you're selling, it's doing real damage out there. People are out there right now doing dirt on your behalf, making mistakes that I'm gonna catch, one by one, from your friends to your auntie to your mama. And when ain't nobody left, I'm gonna take you, too. [indistinct radio chatter] OFFICER: So you're sure the last time you saw her was last night. SANTOS: Yeah. Sarge. We thought you might want to hear this. SANTOS: It's just that Claudia didn't show up for work, wasn't answering her phone, so I checked on her, found her here, overdosed. And that you weren't the last one to see her. No. I let Louie in around 1:00,then I took off. Louie? Franklin Saint's auntie? Yeah. [birds chirping] [dogs barking] [whispers]: Hey, baby. Hmm? Mm... I didn't want to leave without talking to you. [groans] Just... I'm fine, baby. -I just need to rest. Go. -Mm-hmm. Maybe I should stay home today. Mm-mm. Jerome, I'm for real. Just go. I just need to sleep. All right, baby, I'll see you tonight. Why are we waiting? We should take her in. [indistinct radio chatter] That's why. [car door closes, engine starts] Let's get her. [knocking on door] VICKS: Los Angeles Police Department. [knock on door] LAPD. Open up. [exhales] Look, I already told you that shit was clean. Just me and Fatback, in and out. FRANKLIN: You sure nobody saw you? Franklin, how the fuck am I supposed to be sure about some shit like that? I ain't been picked up yet, so why you sweating me? 'Cause Andre came at me last night. Seems to have in his head that we a problem that need to be dealt with. Well, ain't Andre had that in his head for a while now? Not like this. They coming for us, man. Our people, our money. We got to be smarter, protect ourselves. Come on. [grunts] What's up, y'all? -We straight? -Depends. You got the cash? [car door opens, closes] FRANKLIN: Hold up. What's your plan? My plan? What you mean, my plan? I'm-a sell that rock. When it's gone, buy some more, -then I'm gonna sell that, too.-And expand? MANBOY: Talking about staying out of your territory, -I know what's what. -You better make sure your crew know that shit, too, then. FRANKLIN: Hey. Remember back at Foshay, that food fight that turned into a riot? Oh, yeah. That shit was crazy. -[chuckles]: Yeah. -The fire alarms ringing. Shit, a couple motherfuckers went after their teachers with their trays. Mm. Knocked that old lunch lady out cold. -That lunch lady. Damn. -You know, a few of us, we knew to stay out the mess. Not to go after each other or the teachers. Shit, I hopped that fence and I was gone. [Franklin chuckles] Yeah. You know... ...this shit? We stay out the mess. Yeah, I'm with you. [laughs softly] Holler when you want some more. Fo sho. That's cute. [car door opens] He really run away from that fight? FRANKLIN: Nah. He was the one that knocked outthe lunch lady. Fuck you, Andre! I want my goddamn lawyer right fucking now! [shouts] [grunts, panting] We have her at the scene,but she lied about the timeline. All circumstantial. The last thing we need is to put an OD on the board as a murder. Why don't you let it rest until the ME report comes in? Because that's Franklin Saint's auntie. The kid who beat the murder rapa couple months ago? Look, we got her 24 hours, right? Let me go in there and sweat her, shake out some evidence, see if I can get something to leverage her with. We do have to go to court today. All right, Sergeant. Go in it. Hey. Sorry I'm late. -Hey. -They counter? Came back with no contingencies,and 50,000 above asking. 50? You serious? Yeah. They claim to have another offer. I'll need to move additional funds over if we're gonna counter. I can pull what we need from the accounts in Jersey. Uh, if we decide to up our offer, I'll just move cash to the escrow account. Why? What's wrong with our offshore accounts -all of a sudden? -You know, right now, I want to keep all our real estate holdings clear -of any money Reed Thompson knows about. -[pager beeping] Just to be safe. Uh... Uh, give me a minute, okay? [line ringing] [over phone]: Hey, it's Yuda. Avi's here. You can come up to the house. FRANKLIN:Good. All right. I'm on my way. I got to run. -Franklin... -Tell me something, you think they really got another offer? Uh, I have no idea. It's possible. Hmm. All right, let me think on it. I love you. [door closes] ANDRE: Listen to me, Louie. We got a witness put you at the scene. And I also know you and Claudiahad a fight a while back, put her in the hospital. That's motive. Tell me what happened now, and maybe I can help you. [Louie laughs] You full of shit. The window in the bathroom didn't have the shades down. It faces the building in the back. Do you understand what I'm saying? Cooperation at this stage means a lot. But once I file witnesses, hard evidence? Ain't a damn thing I can do. AVI: Franklin! To what do I owe the pleasure? [chuckles softly] Avi. [sighs] Everything okay? Everything's peachy. Just a little preoccupied, that's all. So what's up? I need your advice on something. Having some issues on my cash flow. AVI: What, those rocks of yours not selling? FRANKLIN: Actually, they moving better than ever. Problem is... I don't know what to do with my money. The best kind of problems. [chuckles] Yeah. -But problems just the same. -Hmm. A while back, you was telling me -about offshore banking. -AVI: Hmm. That something you could still help me with? Ah, well. That depends. How much money we talking about? YUDA: Six inch open-bolt -submachine gun. -How many rounds per minute? -950. -[exhales sharply] Why don't you... let me talk to some of my contacts? See what I can do. -You like? -[scoffs] Hell, no. You was gonna shoot me with that, first time we met. Ah, I was never gonna shoot you. -[laughs] -I was testing you. [both chuckle] There's a big difference. [Avi sniffs] Sure you're okay, Avi? The longer you live, the more mistakes you make. And eventually, if you're not careful... ...they catch up with you. What mistakes? [chuckles] No matter. [Avi sniffles] Never get too greedy, Franklin. The minute you do that... they found your weakness. You lost your advantage. Yuda, show our, uh, young friends out. And give Leon here -an extra Uzi with a couple of mags. -[laughs] So... you'll see why the Israelis make -the best weapons. -[Franklin chuckles] Here you go, man. Enjoy. LEON: Hell, yeah. Keep the advantage, my friend. [rooster crowing] [birds singing] [engine shuts off] [whistles sharply] ¿Hola? [insects buzz] [birds singing] [shouting in Spanish] Este es Reed. [laughs] Oh, es tipico. Eh? [chuckles] [inhales deeply, sighs] [exhales slowly] Hello? Hello, is anybody there? I got to use the goddamn bathroom! Hello?! Hello? Fuck! Come on, I got to pee! [breathing heavily] [whimpers] I know you fucking see me! [exhales sharply] [urinating] Hey, Louie. [keys clatter in dish] Got you some Jim Dandy's. Sweet bread rolls and peppers. Louie. Hey... [dogs barking outside] Hey, Louie. Hey, baby. What...? [Leon laughing] -[Fatback exclaims] -[Leon laughs] -Oh, shit! -[all exclaiming, laughing] -Shit. Damn! -[laughing]: Yeah, yeah. -[shushing] -[laughing]: All right. -Hey, let me get a turn, bruh. -Hey, in a minute. -What about me? -Man, come on. I don't need shit,y'all gon' have to get your own. Oh, come on, sharing is caring. [chuckles] -Shit! Fuck, you all right? -Oh! -Yeah, I'm good. -[chatter, laughter] Hey, Leon, man. -Hey. -Hey, hey. Hell, no, man. What I told your little ass, man? -Get your ass out of here. -Look, I know what y'all said, a'ight? But... Man, I really want this shit, man, I can help. -What can you do? -More than you, -white boy. -Oh. I'm a soldier. -Fuck, a toy soldier. -[chuckles] Huh, yeah, keep talking that shit, Fatboy, see what happen. -Oh... -LEON: Oh, shit. You gon' take -that shit from him? -FATBACK: No, no, fuck that. I'm about to tell your little ass what's up. Let's go, I ain't scared of you. -Come on, come on. -[Rob laughing] -Oh, I don't know, he's fast. -EAGER KID: I'm right here. -What's up? Can't hit... -Yeah-- No, fuck. -...what you can't see, huh?-Fuck that. Come on, come here. -Yeah. [laughing] -All right, bitch. Now, yeah. [panting]: You gonna show off? Well, let's see if your little ass -can dodge a fucking bullet. -ROB: Whoa. Hey, Fatback, hold on. Hold up. [panting] You know, we don't bring no punks into this shit. So whatever we say, you fucking do it. No questions. You understand? Hey, man, whatever the fuck you want, a'ight? I'm with it. All right, get the fuck out of here. Bitch-ass nigga. [laughing] -FATBACK: Better run, bitch. -Fuck you. Yeah, get your bitch ass out of here. Man, I should've shot his ass. Hey, that little nigga got heart, though. [chuckles] All right. -Let's get this next light over here. -Hell yeah, let's do it. -Eyes closed? All right. -Eyes closed, fuck it. ANDRE: I apologize. [inhales sharply] Had a lot of people to talk to. [gulping] Got a chance to talk to more of Claudia's people. I heard some pretty disturbing things. Didn't realize her reputation. Tricking out young girls, breaking them down, throwing them out. She used them. Probably used you, too. [exhales] You were just a young girl, right? From Louisiana? Man, I bet you she messed with your head for years. I've seen plenty like her. Predators. Look... nobody is gonna blame you for going after someone who's abusive. Someone you loved, who toyed with you, who liked making you feel like shit. STERN: Sergeant. Time's up, Andre. Her lawyer's here. [indistinct conversation] Clock's on. You got two minutes. All right, here it is. You're exhausted, right? So let's just end this here and now. We got opportunity. Santos clocking your arrival, leaving you alone with her. We got evidence. Your prints are in the house, on the syringe she used to shoot up, all over the bathtub. We got motive. I read the hospital report when you beat Claudia, 'cause that wasn't a fight. You nearly killed her. And that's a lot of bad blood. And, finally, a witness. An elderly woman, Mrs. Norman, in the building across the way has a view into the bathroom. You didn't put the shades down. She saw you exchange words. You push her head under. The struggle. And then she was gone. [laughing] You a lying piece of shit. A fucking witness. Bring that bitch in here, Ms. Motherfucking Norman, bring her in here. -Louie, Louie, we can figure this out together. -Oh, no, no, no! Bring that bitch in hereright motherfucking now! I want my fucking lawyer! Left, please. Did you okay this? Having a sergeant play detective? Andre was just checking a few things out while Aviles and I were in court. Wright, you get anything? No, sir. But like I told you before, this family is tied into-- We're up to our necks in this summer games bullshit. I don't need you off your watch. Next time, you clear this kind of shit with me. Yes, sir. You okay, baby? Hm? -I just want to go home. -Mm. [insects trilling, owl hoots] [laughs] [both speak Spanish] [Gustavo chuckles] Mm. Okay. ♪ [indistinct conversation] JULIA: Yeah? You got a minute? -Hey. -Hey. Okay, s-so we did the drop in-in Mexico a couple days back. Teddy had to tell this guy that I was DEA. It's a long fucking story. Rigo Vasco knew. He knew I was DEA. -Jesus Christ. -Someone's talking. I don't know if it's someone in the El Paso office, or if-- I don't-- Somehow he has accessto the undercover files. I don't fucking know. -Tony, Tony. -Okay. You've got to be really careful with this. You start beating the bush now,it points right back at me. -Hold on, you want to stay in? -They think I'm clean, and you see how much I'm getting. This guy Rigo, he supposedly reports directly back to Matta-Ballesteros. Why tell me all this if you want me to fucking sit on it? I'm not, I'm not saying that. Start looking, but just do it quietly. Contact anybody that you have undercover and get them a warning. Also, I think Teddy's gonna reroute the coke through Lucia's farm, so I'm finally gonna get those fuckers. I'd tell you to be careful, but I know you'd just make fun of me. [chuckles] This is a gift. Don't waste it. -I got to get back. -Yeah. ♪ [lights buzzing] [sighs] Mr. Wright, how you doing? Boy, what the hell you doing here? I was just wondering if Melody was home. -She in? -What? If Mel-- Hey. How you doing? What's up? Wanted to see if youwanted to go to Baskin-Robbins. Don't do this here, boy. My treat. MELODY: Not tonight, Franklin. No problem. Oh. Got this for you. She don't want it. [gift clatters] Have a nice night, sir. D-Dad, Dad. Hey. Hey. Hey, hey. ALTON: Evening, Andre. Franklin. Everything all right? ANDRE and FRANKLIN: Fine. Night, Mel. [car door opens, shuts] [engine revs] [car pulls away] -[birds chirping outside] -[snoring] [distant clatter] [clatter] ♪ -Teddy. -Whoa, whoa. It's just me. [stammering] What the-- What the fuck are you doing here? You're a hard man to get ahold of. [exhales] -The recent airdrops... -TEDDY: Have been disrupted. -I know. -Not just diverted or delayed, but shot down. Weapons taken and used against the Contras. Have you even read the latest dispatches? [exhales] This week... uh, hasn't been... great. Had to take Matt home, so... The Sandinistas have found a way to track our movements out of Honduras. We need to find another way. Okay. I'll figure it out. I already did a little looking into it. The problem... is the entry point. So we move it south:Costa Rica. A private airstrip. You'll be able to make your flight paths more unpredictable and use ground transports. And the Costa Rican government? Can't know anything about it, of course. But we may have some support there. From who? A former operative in the Talamanca region. A smuggler. He has an airstrip, but... it's a matter of establishing contact and he's a bit... off the grid. Okay. You got, uh, the details for me? For us. I'm here to help... quietly. I'm to brief you with the option of coordinating and aiding. Y-You're gonna stay here and help me? [laughs] When you came to me in D.C., sent me to Havemeyer, you put me in the middle of this. Oh... yeah, so I guess... that means that you're reportingback to them. You threatened to make noise, Teddy. What did you think was gonna happen? -[exhales] -Operational reports out of Nicaragua are fine; I do not want them knowing -the identities of any of my assets here. -Of course. I won't jeopardize your people. And... I mean, you're okay? -Doing this with me? -You read about the American journalist killed in the La Penca bombing? The Sandinistas are getting the upper hand, Teddy. This isn't about us. Show me the, um... -show me the airstrip. -Okay, mm-hmm. So he's in the mountainous region here. Yeah. Which gives us these options. The cove in here... Yeah, I know. Stern and Aviles briefed me. You gave it a shot. I appreciate the initiative, Wright. You'll make Sergeant II in no time. Thanks for stopping by. Thank you, sir. But... something's happening in my neighborhood. There's more money on the streets, more shootings, new drugs. Something's changing in a big way. You run it up the chain? Lieutenant Todd? Oh, yes, sir. But the Lieutenant isn't that, um... interested. Well... it's admirable to live and work in the community. Good on you, Wright. Captain. This is something new. Okay? It-it's, it's called "rock." And it's expanding beyond my neighborhood and moving up towards the Coliseum. Chief Gates got that area locked down. Oh, of course he does, but... with the opening ceremonies around the corner, I figured... it should be brought to your attention. What are you suggesting? FRANKLIN: Here he come. I hate this nigga, man. [chuckles] Ease up. Good to see you boys enjoying this nice summer day. Should be nice if you got the cash. 'Course I do, Lil' Lee. I trust the count's right. Think I'm gonna fuck around with y'all the way that pure rock movin'? So, you got my re-up or what? Come on. All right, so, we gonna do things just a little different, Drew. I'm gonna give you two birds, untouched. You're gonna cook it yourself, rock it yourself, cut it yourself. Little more sweat for a lot more cash. You feel me? -That a problem, little man? -Just wondering why y'all switching shit up already. 'Cause you can handle it. That's why. I mean, what, you got... cornerboys, cookers. No need for us to do the workyou can do for yourself, right? You wanted trust? Here it is. All right, Saint. See you soon. Mm-hmm. See y'all, boys. [car door opens, closes] [engine starts] I still think trusting that motherfucker don't make no sense. It makes perfect sense. We getting hit, Lee. Cops is on us. Cornerboys getting sloppy. More street business means more problems. Problems we don't need. Nickel-and-diming rockseventually gonna get you busted. Our advantage is pure product at basement prices, and that's where we gonna focus on. From here on out, we only want dealers who can buy kilos. Identify 'em, send them to Leonand Peaches to check out, and Louie'll make the final decision. But we're still moving rock, right? For now... we need the cash flow. But eventually, the goal is to only deal with a few high-level customers... and serious fuckin' weight, huh? -[laughter] -Start thinking about who you want to bring in, all right? -Cool. -All right, y'all. All right, now. What's up, boy? -See you, boy. -A'ight, Unc. -We're gonna get there. -Thank you, man. You feeling better? Uh-huh.
