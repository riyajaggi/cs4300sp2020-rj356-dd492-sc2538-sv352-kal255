After everything we've been through, I didn't think I could feel like that again. I was wrong. You said you want it all. Well, I'm offering you the chance to have it all. Me, Paul... us. And the job, of course. Just not here. Yeah, but I can't leave here, Jules, you know that. I think you can, Teddy. Money for the Contras is pouring in. The arms sale in Taiwan. Cash from the Middle East. The Saudis alone are contributing a million dollars a month. You've done enough here. You've risked enough. Shit, Teddy. (SIGHS) There are other ways to serve. Like where? You know Spelman is named after a white woman? Rockefeller's wife. Thanks for the ride. So... I guess this is it, hmm? At least until Christmas break. What happened to your necklace?
