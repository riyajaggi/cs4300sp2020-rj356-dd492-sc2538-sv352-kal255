 The best kind of problems. Let me talk to some of my contacts, see what I can do. - Sure you're okay, Avi? - The longer you live, the more mistakes you make. I'm-a get you two birds, untouched. You gonna cook it yourself, rock it yourself, cut it yourself. From here on out, the goal is to only deal with a few high-level customers. So start thinking about who you want to bring in. All right, y'all. These are the territories of the people we can trust.

 What we need all them for? To put us in touch with the people moving drugs now. There's a woman in San Bernardino named Bernadette Burns. Sells every pill under the sun, got a cop in every pocket. Then there's, uh, what, Spitter? Over there in Hawthorne. He used to sell that H, but... he might be willing to switch it up. Well, how we gonna control the flow that far from here? That's the beauty of it, Lee. We don't have to. They buy the coke, they cook the rock they sell, - so all we got to do is deliver and collect. - All right, and what happens when one of them motherfuckers - try to cut into our territory? - Then, my brother, you do what you do. Huh? Hey, we done here? You buying speakers? This is a goddamn place of business, ain't no goddamn clubhouse. White boy out front. All right, y'all, we gonna take a break. Look at this place. Jamming Jeromes. Who knew you were all so enterprising? 'Sup, Avi? Trying to upgrade your system? I might. But right now, we need to go to the bank. It's after 3 o' clock, man. Bank's closed. For big-time entrepreneurs of international commerce, banks are never closed. At least not where we're going. This is what you wanted, yes? - Uh-huh. - Yeah? - Then let's go. - Right now? I've made appointments, Franklin. These people need to trust you. Yeah, well, I ain't got that kind of money sitting in my pocket. I need to go get it. Yeah, yeah. Of course. We'll take you. Nah, you and the Hardy Boys'll stay here. I'll be back in about half an hour. Franklin, this is no small-time street corner shit. It's got to be at least 1.5 million for these people. ♪ Snowfall 3x03 ♪ Cash and Carry What? What's the problem? Just trying to get my bearings. You know, these maps are not always reliable, and the terrain changes all the time. You better not get us lost up here. Yep, that's not likely, considering the only direction we really got to worry about's up. That's always been your problem. What? Paying so much attention to detail that you miss the larger picture. Larger picture's not gonna mean shit if we're walking into trouble. Kim gave the go-ahead to our man in San Jose. Oh, great. Is your contact working with the CIA? You trust him? Champagne, Captain? No, thank you. We are soldiers, not rock and roll stars or gunrunners. Okay. Here's to you... ... for breaking your cherry in international banking. Glad to see you in a better mood than last time. Well... makes me happy, dear Franklin, to know I was right about you. Right about what? That you're a mensch. And here we are, on top of the world. They won't bite. Hey, y'all. I'm Bobby Kim, but around here, they call me BobBob. Hey, BobBob. I'm Julia. This is Teddy. Hey. You're a little ways from home, aren't you? Assuming you being here means the United States government needs our airstrip. What makes you say that? What else could you want? We don't have any uranium. Few hundred miles north of here, people are fighting for their freedom. And if we don't arm them, they will lose. And only our little tribe can save them? You know how important an access like yours can be. You. You're wondering about these men. Nota and Anhil killed a man because Nota wanted to take his wife. For this crime, they'll be burned at sunset. Do you have a problem with that? No. No problem. Good. So, now you know what we do with our criminals. Let's go down to my place, and we'll see how you measure up. Let's go. Leon. They got you making drops now? I'm over distribution, Boy. You always work with me. No disrespect, little homey. Not if you got what I need. Yeah, nice, girl. Hey, Wanda! What the fuck is this bullshit?! Hey, Lee. - You fucking bitch. - Look at this nigga over here crying 'cause he can't keep his bitch off a better man's pipe. Who the fuck you talking to, nigga?! Who you fucking talking to? Grab this nigga, man! - Fuck you, nigga! - Nigga, relax! Calm the fuck down. Here we go trying to make your stupid ass rich, and you got a fucking spy giving our recipe, nigga? Probably set up my truck, nigga?! Fuck you! And fuck you, too, bitch! I miss you, too, Leon. Hey, we out. Shit. - Bye, Lee. - Shut the fuck up! You done messed up, girl. I told you to stay your ass in the back when he was here. Yeah, but you didn't tell me he was here. Bitch, I said his fucking name! Sorry, I didn't hear you. Hey. - Ah, welcome back, Mr. Drexler. - 'Sup, man. Hey. - May I take your bags, señor? - Hola. Sí, señor. Hmm. Huh? Why don't you get cleaned up, and I'll meet you downstairs at the bar? No, my duffel bags don't drink. Then dinner maybe? They don't eat, either. This place got room service? Are you planning to spend the whole time in this room? Not if we go to the bank before dinner, Avi. The vice president we need to see can't make it today. - We'll go some time tomorrow. - Wait. Hold up. Thought you said the banks are always open for people like us. Something came up. He had to go out of town. Just for the night. I'll have his secretary give us an exact time. Maybe then you'll be relaxed, huh? Ain't there some other bank officer we could talk to? No. Mr. Castallan is the man for you. Hello. One thing I've learned over the many years I've lived: if you don't enjoy life today, you never will. Avi, you know what I got up here, right? Your money's safe. Oh, yeah? How you figure that? Hold on. Avi sent me to guard the room so you can go downstairs. What's in the box? Your money will be safe. Raw pigs' brain is a delicacy only eaten fresh out of the skull on celebratory and somber occasions. Interesting. I heard some of the people call you "Dima"? You're good with language. Yes, Dima. It means crocodile. Why do they call you that? My job in your language is procurer. The name "Dima" means... that I get what I hunt for. - And what is it that you hunt? - Medicine. Clothes. Things that make our lives easier. Using our plane and refueling stations, we travel the Caribbean getting what we need by moving contraband. The CIA has taught me many skills. I read your file. It didn't say why you left the Agency. Well, at first, I was a patriot. And after that, there was innocent blood on my hands. And then, finally, I was alone. We've also sacrificed everything to remain faithful to a cause. And, yes, we need your landing strip to provide weapons and supplies to those who need our help. For your Contras in Nicaragua. We'll need to expand the landing strip to accommodate larger planes. You. Tell me why you fight this war. To free the people of Nicaragua, stop the spread of communism. You really believe you can just hand a man his freedom, like a coconut? Oh! Franklin! Come here! Yeah, I love Franklin. This is Franklin, pretty ladies. When I met this guy, well, he was a kid trying to make a few dollars. In less than a year, he became a millionaire, running his... gang like a big business. Ain't that right, Franklin? I watched you grow from a schoolboy - to big-boss millionaire. - Excuse me. Huh? What happened? Hello. You speak English? I mean, I speak some Spanish. I understand you. Cool. Well, um, I just saw you and wanted to speak. I mean, I-I saw you with the flowers today, right? Yes. I supply and arrange flowers for four hotels in the city. Wow. They're beautiful. So, um, would you like to join us? Your friends are not my type. Oh. We could get a different table. Thank you for your hospitality. It's been a long day. We could probably use some rest. So we'll talk some more in the morning? I'm afraid we're just getting started. What is this? The tea brings the inner man out. But first, your body purges itself. The robes are so you won't soil your clothes. - We didn't come here to get high. - It's part of the ritual. Every adult present must drink the tea to honor the dead. You honor criminals? We honor life. And if you want to work with us, you must share in our rituals. How you doing? For a while there... For a while there, it felt like I was gonna die. But I think it's getting better. What about you? I'm good now. Almost good. ¿Mariela? Mariela! Chingada madre. - What? - What time we going to the bank? - Franklin? - What time? The secretary hasn't got back to me yet. I mean... we'll go probably today, maybe tomorrow. Tomorrow? This ain't no damn vacation. Ximena... I need you to go down and do something for me. The fuck you mean you ain't give Manboy his coke?! Louie, I just don't do fucking business with niggas like that! All right? He lucky I didn't put a cap in his ass. Lee, this ain't about you. This about all of us. Franklin and me and everybody. This is motherfucking business, and you acting like a bitch with six sore tits! Oh, I ain't got to hear that bullshit. Peaches, I need you. Gracias. - No, gracias. - Mm. Orale. Ooh-wee, Louie. Damn, mama, you so fine. I could eat your ass with a spoon. Mm-hmm. I understand you and Leon got some kind of problem. You mean Leon got a problem. Leon always ran hot. Got a Napoleon complex. But if y'all want to do serious business, I suggest you get your fucking boy in line. Look like to me Leon trying to do business and then he see the woman that gave you our recipe and our route. You lucky he ain't shoot you. I mean, I can't help it if Wanda see the benefits in being with a nigga like myself. Give it to him. Two birds. Why the fuck they call you Manboy? 'Cause I was a full-grown man when I was still just a little boy. Manboy. Let's go. Let's get the fuck up out of here. Louie. Where Leon? He ain't want to come? Tell him I say hey. We should've killed you when we had the chance. I don't know what you blaming me for. Kevin's the one sold the recipe to the Mexicans. Oh. They told me about Claudia. That's just too bad. Bitch, I'm-a... - Oh! - Hey, hey, hey. Wait here. You forget something? You got to get rid of Wanda. Get rid of her? If you want our product, our business, you throw that bitch to the motherfucking curb. Mm-hmm. Avi. Franklin! Where have you been? What are you, my mom? Where's the money? Ximena, she had a contact at the Banco De Panama Internationale. Put my money in there. Good, right? Why would you do that? Why wouldn't I do that? Came here to look for a bank, didn't I? Now I got one. I had plans for you. I made arrangements. - Arrangements? - Yes, arrangements. Come on, Avi. You want to admit what this shit really about? Huh? An official in the Israeli government is blackmailing me, bleeding me fucking dry. Because of that, I can't pay Reed's gunrunners. - Blackmailing you for what? - Doesn't matter. What matters is, if I can't pay my arms supplier, Reed's gonna dump me. My enemies gonna kill me. So you're gonna steal from me? I was gonna borrow from you... just enough to cover the debt and pay you back with interest before you even knew the money was fucking missing. You know, if my people knew about this, I'd have to kill you. Hell... if one of my people did this... I'd kill them. I'm already dead. You understand? What's the bare minimum you need? $1.5 million. I could get by with maybe a million. A million. Okay. At six percent a week. - What? A week? - Yeah. That's the going rate at the Bank of Saint. Take it or leave it. Two weeks is all I need. Okay. Let's go get your money. Where are you going? Oh, the money's upstairs. Yeah. Those duffel bags are full of sheets and linen. I had Ximena take out a second room. In it there's a million for you and another million for you to help me deposit. Huh? Come on. How long have you been standing there? I don't carry a watch anymore. What did you dream? There was a man... chained to a sinking boat... on a shark-infested shore. Then I threw him the key. When he reached for it, it slipped between his fingers... and fell in the water. Come, let me show you something. We will need medical supplies. 25 M16 rifles with ammunition, a Cessna 441 Conquest II, and 10,000 American dollars a month. Yeah, we can have our construction crews on the ground by a week from today. They'll only work at night. And then... You know, you and Julia want different things. Wh-What does that mean? We, you and I... we're not in this for ourselves, Teddy. We are more than patriotic because we are willing to die and even worse, to suffer and destroy, for the cause. In the end... we expect pain and death. Betrayal. Even insanity. And Julia? She believes in a higher calling, a truth that does not allow for failure or weakness. She will never truly understand men like us. Just put it in my head. There's no reason to suffer. Give me the radio. The radio. Please, please, no. I'm not fucking... Yeah, I told her ass she was cut off - and had to move out. - No, no, no, no. Please. Stop. I'm not fucking... - Wanda! - Please. - You outta here. - No, you can't kick me out. I ain't got nowhere to go. Please, come on, baby. I gave you the recipe. I showed you how Franklin and them do business. - And you had a free ride till now. - I know. The motherfuckers don't want you here, so you got to go. No, no, no, Manboy, no! Don't do it! Stop, no, Manboy! Stop! No! No. No... - No. - Bitch, you better get the fuck outta here before you get hurt. Fuck you, you little dick nigga. I know why they really call you man-boy. Move. Move. What you talking? What's all that shit you talking? Talk that shit now. What's all that shit you was talking, huh? Fuck, there's witnesses, man. There's witnesses, man. This rockhead bitch ain't worth it. You talkin' that shit, huh? Talk that shit? Come on, man! Come on! The fuck off me, nigga! Good to have you back. Mm-hmm. What happened to Avi? Uh... told him to get his own ride home. Huh. I suppose if you're paying, you should have it the way you want. That's right. Captain. Yes, Franklin. I got the cash for this, but if it's all right by you... I'd rather pay by check. Relax. Mucho gusto. I quit the agency and I joined Reed. So I'm your contact now. Get used to it.
