 ANDRE: Now, this rock that you're selling-- it's got a special hold. How you sleeping at night, son? Like a baby. ANDRE: Something's happening in my neighborhood. There's more money on the streets. -(gunshot) -More shootings. -Ha. -Oh! ANDRE: Something's changing in a big way. -It's called "rock." -What are you suggesting? TEDDY: I haven't stopped thinking

 You fucked up, amigo. You fucked up. You should thank us, cabrón. She couldn't be trusted. In the end, she would have turned on us. MARIELA: Your cocaine. Every brick. Our money, guero. We did what you ask. I never asked you to shoot my associate. GUSTAVO: No, compadre. No. You killed her when you sent her and didn't warn me. You don't understand. This isn't... one of your East L.A. homies, right? The DEA is gonna be looking for her. MARIELA: Make sure they never find her, that's it. So, um, you'll come with me, help me dispose of the body, and when we're done, you'll get your money. No. Not my problem. You want my land, my routes? Pay me. I'm going home. Do we understand each other? Yeah. It's beautiful, Franklin. (chuckles) It's just... You can't just up and disappear like that. I didn't even know where I was going till I was on the plane. You know how crazy that sounds? I'm playing a different game now, Mama. Yeah, what's that? Kind that moves as you play. Yeah, well... while you were out there playing, -we lost the property. -What? How? Someone came in with another offer, blew us out the water. -And you couldn't counter? -(scoffs) Like, I don't know, forge my signature. I would never do that. But more to the point, this was a decision that I wasn't comfortable making alone. We did a lot of work to find that property. It's not one we wanted to lose. GUSTAVO: We making menudito? -It's a Mexican stew. -No, I know what menudo is. We're not making menudo. I'm joking, guey. Pinche menudo was my favorite. Mi jefa would make it for New Year. I was the little one, so I never got enough. Por eso on my birthday, she used to make one just for me. Not sure what I find more surprising... ...that you were the smallest one in your family, or that you're choosing now to tell me about it. What are we gonna do with her? Start digging. Long enough for her body and two feet deep. (speaks Spanish) Yeah, Avi, man, he's a slippery motherfucker, you know? LEON: Hmm. Next time, you're coming with me. This hotel, the girls at the pool... shit was crazy. Hey, man, just call up that Jew, I'm ready to go anytime. (chuckles) I heard about Wanda. Yeah. That's how Drew found out about the truck, the projects, the rock. He lied to us. -I should've killed both of 'em. -Mm-mm. Manboy-- he gonna be helpful to us. He gonna move weight. He'll keep a layer between us and them cops. That's important. Was thinking tonight, though, maybe me and you could kick it, if you want. What you had in mind? (laughs) -Eat up. -Hell yeah. Entry is front and rear together with second team, and I want five flanking the perimeter. Your men ready to roll, Sergeant? Yes, sir, Lieutenant. All right, everyone's clear on their role so there's no excuse for anybody tripping over each other. Don't forget, these thugs do not care about you one bit. You do whatever you need to do to keep yourself and the man next to you safe. All right. (claps) Let's go. Hook 'em and book 'em. ALL: Yes, sir. ("Searching" by Infatuation playing) -Hey, you ain't been here in a minute. -Mm-hmm. Hey, you best go get you some skates, man. -Yeah. -(laughs) * I'm in love with the girl... * -What's good? -Hey. -Ten and a halves, please. -Sorry. -11s work, too. -Afraid not. Come on, you ain't even check. You know, I really do want to take you out before you leave. -Why, Franklin? -What you mean why? I mean, what's the point? The point is... I'm gonna miss you. Miss you right now, you ain't even left yet. You ain't gonna be happy till you get both of us killed, are you? * Haven't you heard? * Look... what's between me and your pops is between us. What's between me and you... that's something else. -WOMAN: Come on. -MAN: Come on, bruh. -You backing up my line. -What? -For real? -Come on. Come skate with me after, when you get a break, okay? We'll see. (mocking): We'll see. (chuckles) (grunting) (sniffs) Gun. (breathing heavy) I didn't kill her for lying to us. Or trying to arrest us. (exhales) I guess I killed her for... pretending to love us. (exhales) All right. There's another pair in the bag. And turn off the tank. The water and lye... dissolved at 300 degrees Fahrenheit creates a solution that will dissolve a human body... in just under three hours. Careful, careful, just... You ready? Grab that end. Lift. Okay. Real slow. Let's go. (Teddy panting) You ready? Tip it. Okay, walk, walk, walk. Walk. (grunting): Okay. -Okay, okay. -(sizzling) (coughing) (both coughing) (spits, sniffles) (exhales, grunts) (Teddy exhales sharply) (panting) There anything else I need to know about this drug run? So, next time I send somebody to work with you... they will come back alive? Okay. Let's clean this shit up and go home. (ragged coughing) (Teddy sighs) (Teddy exhales sharply) * When I hear music, it makes me dance * * You got the music, here's my chance * * When I hear music * * It makes me dance * * You've got the music * * Here's my chance * -* Went to the disco * -Come on. * Couldn't believe my eyes * * I looked on the dance floor * * And saw so many guys * * I asked myself * * Could this really be? * * Whether it is or not * * I'm going to see... * Aw... look at you, all sad. Playing video games by yourself. Apparently, ain't no skates for me, so... * When I hear music * * It makes me dance... * I don't really want to skate alone. Oh, what about Eva and Lee? Skate's got four wheels... not three. (chuckles) Come on, Mel. You really gonna make me beg? * -No. -(Franklin chuckles) (cheering) MELODY: If you fall, I'm just gonna let you fall to the floor, okay? FRANKLIN: I don't need to watch nothing. I'm a natural. MELODY: All right, show me what you got. Mel, can I get the keys to the break room? -Be quick. -(Leon laughs) Yeah, right. -All right, you ready? -Yeah, where we going? This way. Balance, mind your balance. (stammers) It doesn't matter. (both laugh) -Ah! -See? -Moving too fast. -Uh-huh. All right, come on, come figure this out. All right. Shit, you're just pulling me along. Yeah. All right, so what you're gonna do... -Uh-huh? -Keep your head up, 'cause if you look down, that's where you're gonna go. -Okay. -Bend your knees a little. -Like this? -No. -(laughs) You stupid. -(chuckles) Mind your balance. Bend your knees, keep your top up straight, okay? You're a good teacher. You're a bad student, but we're gonna get it together. Ooh, this is my song. (singing along): * The answers... * MELODY: Wow. * You told me to take * (laughs) * The chance * -* And learn the ways * -Oh, wow. * Of love * (laughing) * And all that it has... * You're stupid. What? * In time you will see... * You're beautiful. Whatever, Franklin. For real. * You said that * * You loved me * * Said hurt only came to pass me * * It sounded so convincing * * That I gave it half a chance. * ("Teen Machine Rap" by Teen Machine playing) See, there's, there's Han Solo niggas and there's Luke Skywalker niggas. Han Solo niggas, they don't believe in shit. Just about what's right in front of them. You know what I'm saying, 2Ton? All business. Now, Luke Skywalker niggas, they believe in the force. You know? (sniffs) -In the higher powers. -2TON: So which one is you? * Teen Machine is in the house * * Check it out, y'all... * I'm a little bit of both. -That's why I'm so special. -Nah, nigga, you're Chewbacca. LAPD! -(gun cocks) -(glass breaks) -(clamoring) -Don't move! -Hands where I can see them. -(gun cocks) (clamoring) Damn. * Never be the same again * * I keep forgettin' * * How you made that so clear... * (moaning) * I keep forgettin' how * * Every time you're near * * Every time I see... * Get back here, you jackrabbit motherfucker! (tires screech) (officer shouts) * Hello * * Saying you can only * * Stay a while... * (yells) Stay down on the ground, don't move... (panting) * That it's hard for you * (whispering): Okay. * To say the things... * LAPD! Don't move! * Know are true... * Down on your knees. Hands behind your back. -You like it rough, huh? -Shut the fuck up. -(door crashes) -(yelps) -Shit. Fuck this. -Check that room. -Yes, sir. -(Louie panting) -Hope you can read, Mr. T. -Hey, hey, hey. -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Fuck your goddamn fucking warrant, man. -(yelping) -Where's your stash, -brother? -Fuck your stash. Up your mama pussy. -My mama's pussy? -Yeah, boy. That's funny shit. Smash everything! Break it all! (overlapping shouting) JEROME: Hey, what the fuck are you doing?! That's fucking illegal! (overlapping shouting) Get off of me! -Get your hands off... -(grunting) (overlapping shouting) Fuck you! Fuck you! -(Louie screaming) -(choking) No, stop! Stop! -(choking) -Let me go! (fading, echoing): No, stop! Stop! Let him go! Let him go! (sobbing): Stop! No! (gasps) Fuck you! -(Jerome grunts) -Stop... (yelps) (overlapping shouting) Stop! Stop! -Get off of him! -(shushing) Get off of him! -Stop that, you'll kill... -(blows landing) Jerome! Stop! (blows landing, Louie screaming) (screams fade) Sure you're the girl I grew up with? Hmm? Stop. -And no, I'm not. -(knock on door) Oh, shit. Get dressed, fool. Pull up your pants. One second. You good? -Uh-huh. -(door opens) Mmm, what y'all two doing? Mm-hmm. Y'all scared the shit out of us. (chuckles) Hey. -(sighs) -Oh, this is nice. -Shon-Shon, you holding? -(keys jingle) And I want props... -Yeah. -...for not doing it all without you. Let's see here. -Hey. -What? (sniffs) (coughs, sniffles) -Here you go. -(pager beeping) (pagers beeping) (sniffs) (snorts) Frank. (Franklin groans, exhales) You okay? -Yeah. How's Jerome? -He weren't in with you? Man, the cops-- they beat him up real bad. Took him out on a stretcher. LEON: Those motherfuckers, man. They forget to mention that? -Or did you fuck up? -This is how they play the game. Lose paperwork, move people around, withhold as much as possible. FRANKLIN: All right. I want everybody out. Finding my uncle? That's your number one priority. With those injuries, he'll likely either be at White Memorial or the jail ward at County. You all should go home and get some rest. I'll let you know when we get something. (sniffles) Hey. You know, you can get out of here if you cooperate. Your slate will be wiped clean. Like I said, Mr. Occifer, I... I don't know what in the hell you're talking about. I... I was over there visiting my play auntie. Visiting or eating her? -(scoffs) -(whistles) Fat motherfucker. Y'all a cute couple, nigga. ANDRE: How the hell did this end up in my neighborhood? I don't know, but these busts... Shit, all this international in town, -the chief's gonna cream his dress blues. -(chuckles) Oh, I got to say, man. I don't know how you do it, living out in the jungle with those animals. Thank God you're one of the good ones. Good job today. (door opens, closes) FRANKLIN: No. No, no, that's great. Thank you. -Everybody finally out. -Anything on Jerome? -You get everything you need? -This should be fine. Nice meeting y'all. (door opens) -(door closes) -So how bad is it? Everything, from possession with intent to resisting arrest to weapons. -At least ain't nobody talking. -Hmm. You know, they couldn't charge the minors at all. Might be smart, using more going forward. (scoffs) You need to be thinking about how you gonna handle Andre before you be talking about moving forward. -That motherfucker was here, Franklin. -(phone ringing) Hello. (panting): Okay. Thank God. Mm-hmm. No, no. Okay, I'll be there soon. Okay. Um, County USC. -He all right? -Uh, they ain't saying. They, they want to hold him 24 more hours for observation. LEON: Well, did they say if he awake? Prentice said I might be able to see him, so... Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. We'll drive. No. You want to do something for me, you clean this shit up. I don't want Jerome coming home to this. (door opens) (door closes) Maybe Louie got a point. Could be good to put the brakes on this shit until we figure out how to deal with Andre. (papers shuffling) Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. (clears throat) (grunts) What time is it? It's almost 2:00. -Are you okay? -(sniffles) Mm. I think maybe I caught a bug down there or something. Hmm. Is there any way you'd consider staying on a little longer? I don't think that's a good idea. Well, you know the op. And you're better at logistics than I am. I'm pretty sure the... suits in D.C. would be more than thrilled to know that you were still here keeping an eye on me. You know it's more complicated than that. Paul could come. -Uh-uh. -He could stay with your parents a little longer. We'll hire help, then he'll come out here. We'll all be together. You think bringing our child into the middle of this is safe? I can keep you both clear of the more dangerous parts of it. I know that was meant to be thoughtful, but honestly... (chuckling): I mean, it just sounded patronizing as hell. Uh, I mean... -(grunts) -You know, my brother wasn't the first person to get hurt on this op. But I wouldn't be asking you this if I didn't know that I could keep you both safe. And I know you're not happy in D.C. Stuck behind a desk. You telling me you didn't have fun in Costa Rica? A little bit of fun, in the field, just the two of us? All I'm saying is, what if we could get all that back? And live the life we always wanted? (engine stops) (siren wailing in distance) No. (sniffles) (chuckles softly) ANDRE: Remember, feet set. Keep your sight lined up. Watch your breathing. (gunfire nearby) Not bad. (whirring) I heard about last night. Eva said there was a raid in the projects. Few other busts. And apparently Jerome got beat up pretty bad. Well, you know, it's unfortunate, but he, uh, he assaulted an officer. So you were there. Did you try and stop it? Daddy, I thought you became a police officer to protect our people. (sighs) Part of protecting our people means keeping the neighborhood as safe as it can be. By putting Jerome in the hospital? Look, uh... I know you and Franklin are close, and that there's nothing I can do about it. But he and his family chose the wrong side of the line... ...and bad things happen to bad people, Mel. That's just how it is. (whispers): Squeeze. Push, pull. FRANKLIN: By now, y'all know we got into some trouble last night. Them damn pigs, huh? -OTHERS: Fuck the police. -Fuck the police, man. Came at us with everything they had, but here we all are. All y'all out, got the best lawyers money can buy, and you gave them cops exactly jack shit, and that's good. That's smart. It's how we survive. But we gonna have some changes. We gonna get more lookouts, more runners, and we gonna rotate 'em so the faces don't get familiar. But above all things, we gonna make sure that y'all are protected, always. I tell you all the time, we always got your backs long as you do what's right. But there is one thing we need to discuss, and that's the cookhouse. Cops never should've found it. Anybody got any idea as to how that might've happened? Huh? Come on, man. Y'all weren't blasting any music? Going in and out the front door? Maybe bringing the occasional female around to smoke, -kill some time? -Nah, man. No? We was quiet as church mice. I mean, we was just doing -what you all wanted. -Hmm. Man, y'all must've fucked up. -Yeah. -Yeah. Shit. Good. Proud of you. Y'all motherfuckers think we stupid? -No! -Huh? We don't know every fucking thing y'all do? Y'all do good, and we'll take care of you, always, but you fuck up... (gunshot) AUTOMATED MALE VOICE: Sunday, 12:07 p.m. (answering machine beeps) WOMAN: Hi, sweetie, it's Mom. I'm just calling to see if there's a chance you'd be able to make it back next week for your dad's birthday. He would be so surprised. I-I know you're busy. No worries if you can't make it. No pressure. I love you. Te amo. Okay, bye. (answering machine beeps) (sighs) * -(boy laughs) -Adios, amor. (woman speaks Spanish) (boy and woman speak Spanish) SPORTS ANNOUNCER: Tied ball game here in the top of the sixth inning. One out, one on. (continues indistinctly) I heard you were dead. You? What do you want, Gustavo? Have you heard what they're saying about you? I can't be seen with you, vato. I know. (chuckles) Easy, cabrón. You don't think I know when I'm being set up? What the fuck is in San Diego? I'm all right. Goddamn it. Still think we should take him to Cedars. Give him the best help so he can recover properly. Ain't going to no goddamn hospital. Only medicine I need-- bonded and fortified. Nigga, get the fuck off me. Nephew. FATBACK: Come on, get better, man. LOUIE: You got it, baby. I know how this feels, how bad you must want to get back, but... ...you can't kill no cop. Not like we didn't have those discussions during the Panthers, more than once. And I'm not making a moral judgment, neighbor or no. I'm talking practicalities. I'm talking about the hell that will be rained down upon black folks if that happens. I hear you. (door opens) (door closes) How's Jerome? Not so good, Mel. I'm sorry. It's okay. You're not the person in your family that need to be sorry. Listen, I'm telling you this because I care about you and your family. Mm-hmm. You got to stop. -What? -These are the police, Franklin. They know everything you're doing. Oh, yeah? Why aren't we in jail? Why my uncle crib destroyed? Him beaten half to death? Because he hit a cop, Franklin. Because they was fucking with Louie. -(door opens) -While your dad watched. -LOUIE: You better get her off my property. -CISSY: Louie. -Louie, come on, baby. -Fuck this bitch... Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold on. Sweetie, come on, come on. -I got her. Okay. -LOUIE: You better get. -Okay, okay. -Get your girl. (door closes) Listen, I ain't saying they was right... but y'all are provoking them. You ain't giving them no choice. Franklin, please, just listen... Get the fuck out of here before I call her back.
