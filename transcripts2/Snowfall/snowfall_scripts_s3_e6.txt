 It was supposed to arrive two days ago. I'll resume the drops when you get me my fucking club. I know that I said I didn't want you to meet with the Colombians, but what do you know about nightclubs? You know your daddy and the rest of them pigs snatched up my cousin. Hey, I'm talking to you. Shon-Shon. The only thing that makes sense is that she drugged me. I need you to do something for me, Nix. I'm gonna bury Franklin Saint. About fucking time.

 I'm-a need you to find out where he lays his head. Smells good. Sorry. No, don't put it out on my account. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Are you? There's something I need to tell you about Franklin. ♪ Hey, boy ♪ ♪ I know it's what you wanted ♪ ♪ Closer to me ♪ ♪ Sweet thing... ♪ Hey. ♪ I know just how to flaunt it ♪ ♪ Can't you see? ♪ ♪ I'll deliver... ♪ Morning. How you feeling? Any better? A little. You look better. Hey, um... How much longer are you gonna be like this? Like what? Sitting around, feeling sorry for yourself. Okay. I'm done asking. - Let's go. - What are you doing? Getting you packed up, taking you to school. - You're gonna make me go? - That's right. Get up. Daddy, I told you I'm not going looking like this. They gonna see my face and think I'm some hood rat. Well, then let's take a road trip. Okay, baby? And by the time we get there, you'll look better. - No I won't. - Then why won't you tell me what happened? Because you'll just make it worse. So you gonna blame me, and you won't even be honest? Like you've been honest with me. Either you're gonna get up, pack your bags, and get ready to leave, or I'm gonna pull that money, and you can call Spelman yourself and tell 'em you ain't coming. Fine. That's what I'll do. Hey. What's up? Y'all paged me. You were young, but, um... how much do you remember about my cousin Jack? Jack? I remember y'all both moved west together, joined the Panthers together, he got killed by the police. The FBI, but, yeah. I also remember you was around less and less after that. What I never told you was why he was murdered. He was an informant. Jack was a snitch? But you, you told me he'd been gunned down, that he'd been done wrong. And he had. He had been funneling information to them for months. And they must have felt like he outlived his usefulness. And when they decided that, they killed him. I'm telling you this now because your mom told me about your relationship with Reed Thompson. Okay. This ain't the same thing. FBI, they was, they was trying to destroy the movement. I mean, Reed Thompson, he needs me. Mm-hmm. Got you out of prison, he needed you so bad. But what happens when he doesn't? Listen, I got people coming at me every day, Alton. He just another motherfucker that need to be dealt with. No, he ain't. A gangster, you'll spot him coming at you a mile away. But if this man is United States government, he will destroy you and everything you know, and you will never see him coming.

So, I could stake out his mom's place, follow him from there, but a white guy just sitting in a car, - that neighborhood is... - Yeah, yeah, don't do that. Let me think on it a beat.

The Spook Who Sat by the Door. This is the story of a man who was isolated, manipulated, and weaponized by the CIA. What are these? Church hearings, 1975. Transcripts of an investigation into the CIA and the FBI. Word has it they spied on King and infiltrated many of our black groups to breed dissent. Black Panthers. Freedom fighters. Even choirs. When black folks organize, scares the hell out of the American government. Yeah, I'll bet. Tell the boy the most important part about that there. How they had a way to kill us without any detection. Called it the "ice gun." Mm-hmm. They could shoot us, and we wouldn't even know. Only left a little red dot, just like a bug bite, and then a couple of days later, boom, you fall dead from a heart attack. This young man does not need to hear your conspiracy theories. Let's go get you some cake.

Can I see some I.D.? Uh, we don't carry that kind of I.D. around. - I'm sure you understand. - Yeah. Then you can be anybody, and I don't really have to talk to you. I'm sure you understand. Can I call you Tony? No. Mr. Marino... Agent Marino. Look... I understand. You're frustrated. Frustrated? An agent I've known for years goes missing, is probably dead, and some mystery woman who claims to be CIA is looking into it. I'm baffled, is what I am. What makes you think she's dead? She missed her check-ins. Her place made to look like she ran, which I know she would never. The last time we talked, she mentioned being exposed. - Can you tell me when was the... - No. You tell me something. Who exactly is Teddy McDonald? I don't know. Why? He was the guy she was working for. The alleged Fed... who recruited her told her she'd be accumulating evidence against the Medellín Cartel. Did you ever meet this man? Did your agent have... any other information about him? Never met him. Only know he's CIA, or claimed to be. Are you gonna tell me what the hell is going on? Unfortunately, I'm not allowed - to go into any specifics. - Yeah, course not. Look... I got no support at the DEA. They're convinced Lorena got turned. It happens. But I know it didn't. I think she's dead. And this guy McDonald's involved. He's the guy you need to be talking to. He also went under an alias. Reed Thompson. Track him down, you'll find out what happened to my agent. Agent Marino... Do your fucking job. Call me when you do. - Don't worry, he ain't here. - Thank God. I'm starving. Y'all got fries? Leon kept begging me to sneak out last night. I was like, "Nigga, you ain't slick." Just trying to get some. Hey, Shon-Shon been sweating you? Last time I saw her, she had the nerve to speak. But I ain't worried about her, and you shouldn't either. I was just... making sure you was good. I'll be better when I get them clothes you can't take with you. Make all them bitches jealous. I don't even know if I want to go now. And my dad has been sweating me. Talking about... he ain't gonna pay, when, shit, it's my college fund. Wish I had a daddy who'd saved up for my college. You act like I ain't got no problems. Ain't saying that. But, damn... I'd trade places with you in a minute. I want to go away to school, live in a new place, study what I want instead of having to get a shitty job. I love you. I mean, you're my best friend. I don't know what I'm-a do when you gone. But go to school, ho. A'ight. So, uh... should we make some Kool-Aid, too? Red or grape? Red! Always red.

Inventor, revolutionist, author. Like all the things he wanted you to be? What he regrets he'll never be. My dad named me after his uncle. He was this... real guy's guy. Army ranger, real-life war hero. Expectations didn't really get any lower from there. Damn. That's a lot of pressure to be a success. America loves a winner. Yeah. But what if America really was the land of the free, though? You know, free everything. Land, money, thought, opportunity. How would we measure success? America is the land of the free. You know? There's people fighting to make sure of that right this minute. You don't agree? White folks are fighting to keep what they got to get even more, and black folks are fighting to survive. And America don't give a fuck whether we make it or not. Yeah, obviously, your people got a raw deal. I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that just because the playing field isn't level, it doesn't mean you don't have every opportunity. - You really believe that? - Yes, I do. It's what makes America great. See, what you don't realize, Reed, is there's two Americas, and we don't live in the same one. But you know what's interesting about that? That despite that, somehow, the two of us still ended up doing dirt. I mean, I know why I'm doing it. What I don't understand is, why are you? Maybe I take the money and do good. Some kind of yay-slinging Robin Hood, huh? Maybe. So, who are you helping, Reed? The white man keep his place on the throne? Or am I part of some fucked-up community outreach program - for disadvantaged kids in the hood? Huh? Oh. I'll wait. Mm-hmm. It's me. What time? Got to get going. - Everything okay? - Yeah. No, I-I got the check. Oh, thanks, man. Thank you. - Glad we did this. - Yeah, man. Me, too. Junior think his shit rocking. Wait till he hear my shit. His ain't gonna be half as nice when we get done. That's what I'm talking about. - Finally getting that upgrade, huh? - Yeah. Bass about to be harder than your heartbeat. Where's he at? Damn. Hey, I didn't want to ask you in front of everybody, but I heard you asking Avi about the connect. What's up with that? Think he might work for some big people. - Colombians? - Nah, not sure. I'll let you know if I find out, though. Promise. - Unk. - Nephew. - You straight? - Yeah, I'm good. The hell you got them so far in the back for? - Shit gonna be muffled. - I just want whatever gonna make the people feel me when I ride by. Didn't want to take up his whole trunk. You ain't got to. You just pull them forward. They ain't gonna fit, boss. Why are you questioning me, huh? It is gon' fit. You don't know how to do it. You pull them forward, you turn them around. What it say? Jammin' Jeromes. I get a second? Yeah. Sure. Give the people what they want. - How you feeling? Good? - Mm-hmm. Shit, that man about to quit today. That man got five kids. You know, I was hoping you might let us store some of the product in the back. Just for a while. That wouldn't be smart. - They came to my house, they'll come to my business. - Nah. Andre being on the bench means we got some breathing room. Ain't gonna be no more raids for a minute. It's just temporary. Besides, you're the one who said you don't want to have to leave the shop to go re-up with Manboy. Don't this make your life easier? - Okay, temporary. - Good. One more thing. What you remember about cousin Jack? Alton's side? He the one who got shot, right? You know he was a snitch? Heard some rumors back in the day. People believe that rumor? Some did. Fuck you asking? Nah, I'm just... just curious to know happened. What difference does it make? Cops don't need no reason to kill a black man. Don't you mean the FBI? Alton said they killed him. You need to ask Alton about that. Come on before I change my goddamn mind. Have to move some stuff around here. Make sure you put that stuff behind the inventory. Mm-hmm. Boys. Go see what rooms you like, hmm? Andale, ándale, vamos. Mira. We might not be able to leave after all. Why? He threatened to kill me. Come after all of us. You remember him? What he did to get put away? It's back here. When you're not using it, unplug it. Damn thing's so old, it overheats. Yes, ma'am. Any idea where to start? Only paper that covered our murders-- Back then and even now-- Is the I.A. Sentinel. Clean up your mess when you're done. ♪ ♪ "Active member of the Black Panther Party found dead. Single gunshot wound to the head. No gun recovered." A single gunshot? I have a question. Hmm? It's something that Rigo said. Yeah, the DEA agent? You overheard. Well, I mean, technically, I read his lips, but yeah. She'd left the DEA. She was working with me. She was collecting intel on various Colombians, including Rigo. "Was"? Yeah, I made a mistake. Tried to be in two places at the same time. It was fucking stupid. I miscalculated... and she died. Jesus, Teddy. What about her body? It's gone. For good. I mean, the Agency's not exposed, if that's what you're asking. I'm sorry. Yeah, me, too. I'll go to school. But I want to do the road trip. The one we talked about last year. Santa Fe. Dallas. School doesn't start for another three weeks. We take all that time. By then I'll be healed. How soon you want to leave? Tomorrow. Day after at the latest. I've got to pack and say bye to my friends. Sounds fair. There's a party tonight. Lots of people will be there, and I'd like to go. Anything else? Okay. You have something for me, Avi? I do. But there's one thing I want to make clear first. I've survived a lifetime in a game into which you have barely dipped your pinky fucking toe. And I'm not going away any time soon. Certainly not by some punk kid who somehow got it into his head he's the black Bronson. You got what I came here for, or no? Yeah... I'm gonna give it to you because I'm a man of my word. Ah, no, Avi. You're gonna give it to me because you lied to me and because you owe me. Don't get this shit twisted, Avi. You brought this on yourself. I fear the kind of man you're becoming. There's one more thing that's not in the file, but it's gonna cost you another week of free interest. Go on. The pilot, Matt, he wasn't his partner. He was his brother. You sure? We were in Panama, he was out of his mind on coke, his dick in some hooker's mouth, and he let it slip. Matt may not be his real name, but they're certainly brothers. I'll call you when I have your money. Good. Tel Aviv, 1978. Entered the country as James Smith. Two years later, in Tehran. That time he was known as Thomas Parker. So he is CIA. Uh-huh. Anything else? Uh, his real name? Who he's with here? His history before that? No. That... that's it. So now what? He's never taken you anyplace official? You never signed anything or received money? No, but I gave him money for the product. - He working with anyone? - Here and there. It's always changing. But the one person he said was his partner, turns out that guy might be his brother. He's isolated. From the Agency. It's gonna be that way, too, 'cause the government will want to distance themselves from pumping drugs into our community. He's alone. You're not. And you've got money. A lot of it. We can use that to fortify you. Yeah. And there's something else I wanted to ask you. Uh, about Jack? I'd imagined Jack was gunned down in a hail of gunfire. A bloodbath. But he wasn't. He was killed by a single bullet fired to the head. What really happened to him? When the FBI were done with him, they told anybody who would listen that he was a snitch. And when the Panthers caught wind of it... ...they were furious. We all were. And they wanted him tortured. So they could see him suffer. And I wasn't about to let that happen. So you killed him. I don't expect... No. You did what you had to do. - I don't want that for you. - No, no. It's... it's not gonna end up like that for us. Okay? 'Cause we gonna figure this shit out. Girl, if you don't get out of my stuff... - I'm helping. - Girls. I'm going to Louisiana's. Can I pick y'all anything up? Uh, thanks, but we were gonna grab something while we were out. Ah. Your goodbye tour. - Mm-hmm. - That's right. Well... have fun. Thanks. Where your pink halter top at? Uh-uh. No, you can't take this with you to Georgia. It's too cold. You're gonna freeze. - I can wear a sweater. - And cover this? Blasphemous. Girl, if you don't give me that shirt... Last year he hit 17 homers and 25 stolen bases. Takes a slider for strike one.
