 Ah. Carol. Hmm. Do you know what time it is exactly? Yeah, exactly three hours till lunch. Is that all you ever think about? No. Sometimes I think about you. Oh. But then I can't eat lunch. Don't you want to see what I got? Big deal. I got two of them. No, no. My new digital watch here.

 Ah. See, it tells you the time exactly right up to the second. It is now 9:08:47. 48, 49, 50. Good morning. 51, 52, 53... Jerry's learned to count. 55, 56... You must be very proud. No, no, no. See, I was just showing Carol my new digital watch. Ah. You haven't seen my new tape recorder. Has three speeds, has an automatic counter, and a lifetime battery.

 Yeah. Well, you see, this baby not only gives you the time, the day, and the date, but also tells you the temperature and the wind velocity. Did I show you my new paper clip holder yet? It, uh, holds paper clips. Has battery recharger and extra long mic cord. Would you like to see the stapler to end all staplers? I'm leaving, I'm leaving. Ah. Incidentally, the barometer's rising. Oh, let's run. Well, I can't, Carol. I have to get ready for my group. Oh, your group's in there already, Bob. You're late. I am? What... What time is it? Did I hear someone say "What time is it?" What time is it, Jerry? It is exactly... 78 degrees. Well, good morning, Dr. Hartley. Do you know what time it is? Uh, no, I don't, but it's getting warmer. Eh. Typical vague psychologist answer. Well, I'm sorry I'm late, but let's pick up where we left off last time. Oh, great. Where were we? I was telling how I won World War II. I thought you were a cook in the Marines. The Marines travel on their stomachs. That's probably why it took them so long to get to Iwo Jima. What's that thing? Oh, this is my new tape recorder. I thought we'd start taping some of our sessions. This smacks of Watergate. What comes next, steaming open our mail? I didn't mean to stir up such a hornet's nest. I... I just thought it might be interesting to see how we interrelate as a group. No, I... I'm not sure I want anybody listening to what I say. Don't worry, Mr. Herd. Nobody listens to you. That's good. How do we know those tapes won't fall into the wrong hands? There are people who'd pay a lot of money for the secrets of Emil Peterson. I wouldn't give you a plug nickel. Well, you're just going to have to trust me. I wouldn't be careless with this machine any more than I'd leave my notebook, uh... lying... lying around. You know, that recorder could help me with my sales work. You know, I could tape the presentation here, and then everybody could give me tips on how to improve myself, huh? I'll give you a tip. Quit your job and join a circus. What an exciting idea. He could be the daring young man on the flying trapeze. Or an elephant. All right, why don't we leave that up to Mr. Herd? Let's... Let's start taping the session. Who wants to start? - I would. - All right. There we go. Just a moment, and go. Ahem. It was a hot spring day. The scent of victory was in the air, and the scent of Corporal Emil Peterson's famous leatherneck stew was on the breath of the 101st Marine battalion as it stormed to victory and won the war. And that's the way it was... April 12, 1943. Thank you. Next. Oh. Hello. Why don't you go with that thought, Mrs. Bakerman? Hello. Anything that's on your mind, anything that's bothering you. Uh, Mrs. Bakerman, I can't hear what you're saying. But this is a personal problem. It's no concern of yours. Could... Could you say something that we could... We could all listen to? All right. Hello. Bob, what are you doing? Nothing. You trying to record me talking in my sleep? You don't talk in your sleep. You, uh, snore. I don't snore. Well, no. Your nostrils were flaring. You woke up just in the nick of time. Oh, I'm sorry to disappoint you. Oh, there'll be other nights. Right. No other nights. You know, Bob, you're really going overboard with this thing. Last night you taped yourself gargling. I was just testing the fidelity of the mic. This is just like all the other gadgets you buy. In a week it's gonna wind up in the back of the closet. Not this baby. This baby is a very expensive professional tool of my trade. How expensive, Bob? It doesn't matter. It's deductible. How deductible, Bob? It's, uh, pretty deductible. How much, Bob? Do you have to keep calling me Bob? All right. How much, Lyle? 420. $420 for a toy? This is not a toy. Testing 1, 2, 3, 4. Testing 1, 2, 3, 4. Pilot to bombardier. Pilot to bombardier. Over and out. Are you going to sleep? No, I'm just going to lie here and let my nostrils flare. Well, if you start snoring, we'll be right here. Will you get that thing out of here? All right. I'm gonna put it to bed. And don't call it a thing. It's my friend. Then why don't you pour it a warm glass of milk? Maybe the left one a little. Good night, Emily. I... I was just dictating a letter. Hi, dear. How was your squash game? Confusing. I should have brought along my tape recorder. You could have recorded the sounds of sweat. I couldn't remember what the instructor said. I know he said to put my two knees together and then swing them to the left, swing them to the right, put your left foot out, and you bring it back. Who's your squash teacher, Arthur Murray? Pow. Pow. Pow. Pow. Honey, uh, could you squash somewhere else? Julia Child is going to do something with a chicken that's never been done on television before. On the family hour? Bob, I want to write this down. You won't... You won't have to write it down. If I can find my tape recorder, You can record it. It was in the den. It's not in the den, honey. I just cleaned there. Then where is it? Oh, honey, hurry, hurry. She's got her cleaver poised. I feel like I'm playing Beat the Chicken. [chopping] Well, it isn't there. Ohh. Is that a chicken? Used to be. Well, I can't find it anywhere. Good. Maybe it's in the kitchen. Yeah. Look in the freezer. Okay, where'd you hide my tape recorder, Emily? What? You hid my tape recorder so I couldn't prove that you snore. Oh, Bob, don't be ridiculous. Well, then where is it? Well, you probably mislaid it. I've never mislaid anything in my life. What about the time you drove off with the briefcase on top of the car? That wasn't mislaid. I knew exactly where it was. Oh, honey, it's probably in your car or in the office. Uh-uh. It's been stolen. Oh, Bob, who would steal it? You want to search me? You wouldn't be foolish enough to have it on you. Oh, honey. Why would I be helping you look for it if I'd taken it? All right, for argument's sake, let's assume you didn't steal it. Well, I'm going to assume that. Then who did steal it? Well, why stop at accusing your wife? Why don't you accuse your best friend? Jerry does have shifty eyes. Did you see what... Did you see what Julia Child just did to that chicken? No, I was being grilled. Well, you're luckier than that chicken. Where is it, Howard? I don't know. Howard, you know what? It isn't right to take somebody else's property. I want it back. Oh. I'm sorry. Here's your... Here's your pen. That isn't what I meant. Oh. [clatter] Bob? Hi. Hi, Carol. What are you doing, praying to the medicine cabinet? Well, my, uh, my tooth was bothering me. Oh, yeah, well, I heard the pain goes away if you kneel on a countertop. Uh, actually, Carol, I'm... I'm missing my tape recorder, and I think Jerry might have... taken it. You think Jerry's a thief? You know, he might have accidentally picked it up and, uh, you know, put it in one of his drawers accidentally. You mean by accident? Yeah. or, uh... maybe he copped it. Bob, well, that's just crazy. You might just as well suspect me. You know, I'm just sort of checking everybody out to... to avoid any suspicions in my mind, you know? I mean, I... You know, I know there's nothing in this drawer, so, uh, I don't even have to open it. Nothing. I guess that clears Jerry. Well, I never, you know, I never really, really suspected him. My... My tape recorder! I don't believe it. You know, I've known Jerry for eight years, and now he seems like a stranger. Carol, what do we really know about Jerry? Well, he's an orphan, and he's a dentist, and he's been a good friend. Not much to go on, is it? One thing I do know. Jerry's stealing is a cry for help. We've got to stand by him, Carol. Well, why don't you let him keep the tape recorder? No, it's my tape recorder. Bob, I don't believe Jerry would do something like this. [chuckles] Carol, you're so naive. I wonder if maybe there aren't some other things missing around the office. You know, come to think of it, I can't find my stapler or my letter opener. Oh, I... I borrowed those. Oh, hi. Uh, what's going on? Just admiring your new tape recorder. Yeah. It looks just like Bob's. Yeah. Only, uh, mine cost 90 bucks less. I got it on sale. Here's the, uh, bill. Read it and weep. Ha ha ha. It's, uh, it's a good deal. Yeah. So what are you two doing in here anyway? I just stopped by to deliver your mail. Yeah, and I was... I was helping her. Don't tell me the two of you carried this up all by yourselves. I... I carried the heavy end. Gee, I must have... I must have pulled something. Well, I think I'll have that checked. Good. Howard's not at home. There's no answer. Now give me the extra key for his apartment. Bob, now, he told you he did not take that tape recorder. A quick search will confirm that. You could be arrested for breaking and entering. Howard is not going to arrest me. I'm his best friend. Uh, excuse me. Do you have an extra key to my apartment? I locked myself out. Here it is, Howard. Ah, thank you. Uh, let me help you, Howard. It's okay. I can let myself in. Well, I... I just haven't seen your apartment for a long time. Maybe you redecorated. Maybe you added something... Something about that big with lifetime batteries and a long mic cord. You still think I took that tape recorder, don't you? I never stole anything in my whole life. Well, I did steal something once, but, uh, well, I didn't get caught, so it doesn't count. Besides, I was a... I was an Eagle Scout. Congratulations, Howard. Oh, thank you, Emily. Howard, uh, don't you think you're protesting a little too much? If I wanted a Marasica tape recorder, I could have picked one up cheap in Japan. You see, Bob? I don't believe I ever mentioned the brand name. Well, I, uh, I... I saw it on the tape recorder when you showed it to me. Nice try, Howard, but the label was in Japanese. I don't believe you read Japanese. Well, I recognize the case. Are you sure it was in a case? - I don't remember. - Aha! You believe me, don't you, Emily? I mean, I was a... I mean, I was a hall monitor in school, and I was an altar boy in church, and I take a shower every day. If that doesn't prove that I... I don't steal, I mean, I don't know what does. Howard. That's our magazine. I know it. All right, I... I don't believe Howard took it. Good. At last you've come to your senses. Well, it narrows it down to one of the members of my group. Well, you're a psychologist, Bob. Have them arrested. See, that's easy for you to say, Emily. You've never had anything stolen. Oh, that's not true, Bobby. You stole my heart before you started acting like an idiot. Well, I may be acting like an idiot, but I have a reason. Idiots don't need reasons. This idiot does. And it's a very good reason. It happened in my childhood. You fell on your head? I used to have a harmonica, and I could play "Pop Goes the Weasel" like one of the Harmonicats. Oh, yeah? Which one? Well, I don't know. The one that played the real long one. Oh. Al. It doesn't make any difference, and one day I came home from school, and it was missing. I figured my... my best friend Herb Broda stole it, and my mother said I'd just mislaid it, and then I... I found out the truth. Herbie stole it? No, my mother stole it. She couldn't stand "Pop Goes the Weasel." Well, I can understand that. I guess that's the reason I'm acting like an idiot. Sorry if you think it's irrational. Oh, honey, I understand. Don't you feel better talking about it now? Yeah, I... I do feel better. Oh, good. My mother hasn't been over here lately, has she? You're probably wondering why I called you all here today. Why? It's our regular session. Right. Are you feeling okay, Dr. Hartley? Uh, sure, I'm fine. It's just that, uh, my tape recorder has, uh, has vanished, and I thought maybe one of you made a mistake and took it home with you. You know, maybe you got mixed up and thought it was your... your coat or your purse. You think one of us took it? I didn't say that. He thinks one of us took it. Why don't you get out the rubber hose? When I was in grammar school, someone stole my teacher's paperweight, and my teacher said that she was going to leave the room and she hoped that the paperweight would be back on her desk when she came back. We could try that. While she was out, someone set fire to her desk. Well, I'm sure if anyone in the group had taken it, they'd... They'd speak up. After all, our group is based on trust and honesty. I took it. You, Mr. Herd? I can't help myself. I... I've been stealing gadgets for years. You know, they won't allow me in an appliance store anymore. I'll call the fuzz. Sit down, Mr. Carlin. Go ahead and call them, Mr. Carlin. A... A person like me should be removed from society. [panting] Mr. Herd, just... just bring the tape recorder back. Okay. What does it look like? I mean, my whole basement's full of tape recorders. You didn't take it, did you, Mr. Herd? No. I was covering for Mrs. Bakerman. I thought she took it. I think it was Mr. Carlin. Peterson's built like a thief. I still think it's Herd. All right, all right. Can we, uh, can we go on with our session? And if anybody feels unusually guilt-ridden about any particular thing, we'll, uh, we'll stop and discuss it at that particular time. Where are my knitting needles? I took them. Uh, look, I can't take any more of this. I'll write you a check for the tape recorder. Look, Mr. Carlin, this is my problem. I'll handle it. - How much is it? - $420. You're right. It is your problem. You could write me a check for my knitting needles. Look, can we try to get going on the session? W-Where's my note pad? I took it. I know how we can find out who the crook is. We'll give everybody a lie detector test. I have a better idea. Let's vote. Uh, just, uh, just forget it. Forget it. It, uh... Ahem. It's a stupid machine, and I... I really... I really didn't like it that much anyway. What's that cord hanging out of your coat sleeve? Uh... oh, that's, uh, that's something new. This is a, uh... a raincoat microphone. Can, uh, can we get on with the session? How can we get on with it? Our group's based on trust, and you don't trust us. Well, I, uh, I have a confession to make. You stole my knitting needles. No, I, uh, I brought my raincoat down to the office last week. I thought it was going to rain, and it didn't, and I left it here, - and the... - [Mrs. Bakerman gasps] The recorder is behind my raincoat. [chuckles] It's really kind of funny, isn't it? No. I really feel like a... Like a fool. Why don't you go with that, Dr. Hartley? There must be some reason you acted like an idiot. You never needed a reason. There is a reason and a very good reason. It happened in my childhood. I had this harmonica, and, uh, someone stole it. I took it. Here it comes.
