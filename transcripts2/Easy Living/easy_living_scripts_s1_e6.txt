 We're done. Let's cover it up and piss off out of here. I hope you've learnt your lesson. You can give it a shot, but every fuck-up has its consequences. But it's over now. Relax. Relax. Márk? Hi. You okay? Want some water or...? Breakfast's ready. Don't be mad, but I've got to go.

 What's the hurry? I've got to go home. To your husband? I've got to talk with him. Will I see you again? Sure. I just don't want to deceive him. I want to be fair... to finish it properly. And after that, lunch...? Hello! Attila... What the hell are you doing? - Having a bath. - Have you taken something? An aspirin, but it's not helped much. I've got a bastard of a headache. Where have you been? There was a charity gala on the Operetta Barge. You remember. - And it lasted till morning? - You never listen to me! Now, out! We're going to the bank. We might just still have a chance. Should we say anything? How about... We went to Jázmin's birthday party in Fót and we missed the last bus back. How's that? I've no idea where the rest are. Strasszer never needed company papers. Well, we need them now. - Morning! - Hi! Are you two still here? Won't you be late for school? Mum... there's something I want to ask you. Yes? Just the two of us. So what I wanted to say... I mean what I wanted to ask was... if you'll take me to see a gynaecologist. Well, well. Past first base are we? No. No, I've got to go cos... - Cos... - Listen, you don't need me for that. I'll find you Kendrei's number, he'll give you a prescription. When are your exams? Márk? You've got to study. It's all that counts! Anything else isn't worth two shits. I know you think it's just a load of hot air. That's what I thought when my dad told me the same thing... But now I'd do it all differently. Do you hear me? Every last thing. - I know, Dad. - You can still make a go of things. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. No. I'm sorry. Jesus Christ, what are you two doing? Aren't you ready yet, Attila? It's time we were off! Strip below the waist. How many sexual partners in the past year? - Don't you know? - None. I hope. I mean, that's why I'm here. Lie down. Last period? 10... About 10 days ago. Hymen intact. Vagina mod. wide. No visible damage to vaginal wall. No indication of coitus apparent. Toxicology Oszi! Hi! You had such a good time here or what? I just brought this back. You could have kept it. I was at gynaecology. You know, that doctor here sent me. Yeah? And? Seems I was lucky. But... I'll be done in a minute! Coming! He gets me drunk, molests me, then his pregnant wife trashes me for getting freaked out. Zoli didn't know what my problem was either. The sneaky little twat! - But I'd batter that woman, too! - Ah, Hanna's alright. At least I thought she was. I mean that's what freaked me about the whole thing. I could get his face broke for you. Zoli's? Er... Ah, no. No. You sure? That's all his sort understand. I bet he's already hitting on your replacement. And she'll let him so's not to lose the 50 thou she gets on the quiet. That sort want their pricks chopping off! Er... Right! So they run a pub? - Here's Márky G! - Did he really shoot someone at that party? - Check out his smashed-up mug! - Fricking headcase! During the procedure in the cranial cavity, the monkey is conscious. The cellular network continues to function even while there is direct contact with the area around it. This is only surprising at first. In the case of head injuries, not the size of the opening in the skull, but the destruction of the tissue underneath it determines the extent of the damage. The brain is basically a mass of nerve, glial, and epithelial cells, which primarily communicate via synaptic, paracrine, or endocrine signalling. These cells' uninterrupted communication implies that in an evolutionary sense they recognize one another and are interdependent. - Vivi! - What? I just wanted to say sorry. What happened... Didn't I tell you before? - Just hear me out, will you? - Can't you get the message, nutter? - Wait! - Don't you touch me! - Leave her alone! - You shut your face! - What's the problem? - Nothing. You can all suck my dick. Miklósi! Miklósi, I'm talking to you! Leave me alone! Leave me alone, all of you! Is that girl one of ours? Uh-huh. Vivien Pap, 11a. Do you consider this acceptable, Márk? Foul language, glorifying violence, objectifying the female body? This isn't the Márk Miklósi we know. - And now you go attacking Mr Fülöp. - I didn't attack him! What can we do with you? The media's full of violence in schools. The last thing we need is a scandal here. I believe we can persuade Mr Fülöp not to go to the police. And there'll be no need for a disciplinary. As long as you decide that you do not wish to continue your studies in our institution. No way! - Please! I've got my exams in a month! - So you have! - You should have thought about that before! - I'm sorry. - I didn't mean it. - You assaulted Mr Fülöp in front of the whole school. I only hope no one filmed it on their phone. ...Subsequently Top Humus Ltd took out a development loan of 30 million, the collateral being the subject of the development: the worm farm. The anticipated growth in turnover, however, did not occur and during the bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings, the worm farm was only just sufficient to repay the interest on the loan. Accordingly, the outstanding debt was transferred to the registered partners in the company, Attila and Janka Miklósi. The bank ensured conditions for repayment in instalments according to the initially realistic, but later distinctly favourable base rate conditions. The latter were offered to you by the late Imre Strasszer, presumably in return for remuneration. He thus became guilty of taking bribes, and you guilty of the crime of bribery. You've no proof of that! The bank fixed the instalments and we simply paid them off. And you noticed no disparity? Or that your debt was still increasing? We paid what we were asked to. In this way, over the years the amount outstanding grew to... after the necessary corrective calculations... 83,137,261 forints. You are faced with two choices. Either the amount is fully repaid within 30 days or the bank initiates debt-recovery proceedings and files a criminal complaint against you. Even you don't believe I can just pluck 83 million out of thin air! And if we go to prison, what good will that do? You'd not get so much as a penny then! So, what do you propose? We both know how this works! If the bank gets even a little back from such a bad debt it wins! That depends on how much that little is. 4 million. That's 5 per cent. We were thinking of 8 million. I said there was no panic. Uh-huh. Now we only need to get hold of 8 mil within two weeks. Well it's better than 80! We can put an end to the whole bloody business! - We've no money, Janka... Nothing! - Then we'll borrow it! - Who from? - Tibi. He's stony broke. He's just blown all he had. Endre? Your mother? - Like she's got a spare 8 million? - Take out a loan on her house! You know she'd never allow it! It was holy scripture at home: never get into debt. She wouldn't have to know about it. You seriously want me to scam my own mother? - It'll be ours sooner or later anyway. - Half of it! Okay, let's go to prison then! And the kids? Attila! Oh, you are nice! Come to say goodbye? How do, Atti? - Did you bring the cakes, son? - What? I spend all morning baking and he forgets them! See you're back on your feet again. It's a mate's in Novi Sad. I'm headed there now. Properties are dirt cheap down there. But if Serbia gets in the EU, prices'll skyrocket. So if you're interested... If you're doing so well, you can pay me back! Atti, I'm sorry about all that, I really did miscalculate a little. But this is the real deal. You'd only need 2 mil, say, and.. I don't give a fuck! Not a flying fuck! - Boys, boys! - Alright, okay. - I want that tray back. - Okay. - You be careful on those roads. - Bye-bye. - When will you be back? - I don't know. See you later, Atti! Take care of Mum! - What the devil is this? - An authorization. So I can sort out all your bills for you. It'll save you bother. Would you bring my specs? Where are they? Behind you. On the sideboard. Oh... Here you are. Thank you. - Where do I sign? - Here. No, no, there. Authorization for Mortgage Hold on, this... A mortgage? You want to mortgage my house? I'm sorry, Mum! I didn't want to trick you. It's just... we've got this little debt... this big debt, and if I don't pay it back they might lock me up. Oh, Lord! Couldn't you have just asked me? But you hate lending money! I never thought you'd agree. Why shouldn't I help if I can? It's lucky Tibi doesn't need it. Oh, Silly-Willy! How are you ever going to get on in this world? I'm sorry! I'm really sorry! The house would be the security. Here are the deeds, a surveyor's valuation, the authorization. One moment. I'm afraid that's not going to be possible. What? The place has been valued at 32 million. - And the loan's only 8. - The deeds to the house have already been mortgaged to the value of 18 million forints. - My mother's house? - It was processed two days ago. Client: Tibor Miklósi. Your brother? What's up? Didn't like it? Oh, come on! So this is your master plan? Selling the settee? Not just the settee. Everything that's worth anything at all. - Where's my car? - You never used it anyway! Tibor's pulled a fast one again. We got nothing from Mum. And Endre's well hacked off with me. We might have to move. I don't believe it! - Flitting, are we? - Just clearing out some junk... Do you know this man? - No. Who is he? - Interesting. We drag one of RapidSped's drivers from the bushes, but yet again you know nothing. What's so interesting about that? Only the fact that while this poor bloke was running onto a knife, once again Endre Hollós had a watertight alibi. You, however, crossed the Ukrainian border on the same day. 17 km from where we found the body. I was on a weekend break with my wife. - I see. - And as we were near, I popped over for some petrol. Then it seems this was just another coincidence. But I'll check up on what kind of vehicle you were driving. Are you accusing me of something? That's not the question. I know you're only a fuck-up whose greatest use would be as your friend's fall-guy. It's not you I'm after. It's Endre Hollós. Attila, be honest. - Did Hollós send you to Ukraine? - No. Just don't let us go dragging you out of any bushes. Goodbye, madam! Hazardous waste Well? Ugh... - Ready? - Uh-huh! That's the kitchen. - Hi. - Hi. - Got a fag? - Yeah, sure. Got a light? I don't usually smoke, only today...! Know where your aorta is? Here, see? - Ha bloody ha. - Aw! Jesus... Look! OSH Sign here, please! Thank you. You will be informed within 48 hours. Stop messing about! Tell me! - Why are you so interested? - Come on! - How old were you? - It's not a very exciting story. 25. 25? The private companies were just starting up. Anyone who knew which way the wind was blowing could make a killing. Making the first million wasn't that hard. And the rest came even easier. Naturally, the majority went bust. Is anything the matter? No, it's nothing. Only someone in our family was in that majority. Spare some change? - You mustn't! - Why not? Not a penny of it goes to the needy. If only you knew who builds mansions with your donations. Jeez! Well? How does it feel? Dunno. Boss! When I thought of Zoli before, he was always like he was when... Now all I'm gonna see is that stupid look on his face! Serves him right. Fucking wanker! See that? What a scumbag! That's so typical! My lady! - You're beautiful! - Thank you! What's up? Know them or something? About your books... I went right through them, there's not many nits to pick. - Really? - The only thing that's a bit fishy is that the hostel renovations were always done by some Zeltner Ltd. and at twice the going rate. Though that's a given these days. Zeltner? It's Janka Miklósi. Hi, Judit! Hi! This is a surprise. I thought I'd pop by. Am I disturbing you? Oh, no! I just wasn't expecting guests! - It's just a flying visit! - I'm picking up the kids soon. - Coffee? - Oh, I'm okay, thanks. - Please! - Thank you! Do sit down! So? What's new? I've been round all our hostels. - And? - And I was very surprised at what good condition they are in. They look very nice indeed. - Don't they just? - Oh, yes... Your husband's firm has done marvellous work. Thanks! Maybe it was even worth paying... twice the going rate... I just hope it doesn't somehow get out. We're all delighted to have you back, Klári! Yet some of us are concerned that the strain so soon after your heart attack might be detrimental to your health. As Klári is the foundation's heart and soul we'd have once had a headache - trying to lighten her burden. - But you don't need to! However, with Janka, we've received an injection of fresh blood. I think we're all amazed at what she has achieved so quickly. Achieved? She went to a reception and got her picture took! My proposal is that we elect Janka as permanent chair with full powers! That's ridiculous! This position isn't just about acting like a tart at parties! It's... - It's... - Oh, God... It's... about responsibility! Christ, Klári, shall I call an ambulance? Remember when we rowed down to the Gemenc Forest? 40 kilometres a day... Maybe even 50. Know how we could make such good progress? Cos we didn't take any women with us. The nights were pretty cold... It was September or the start of October. The stags roaring in the dark shat us up. But it's so good... The steam's billowing from them... They're fighting to the death for the right to fuck all the does. Back then we thought we'd be alpha males, too. And I guess... we both did win something. You got Janka, I got the dough. Why'd you call me? They've found Korsós. In that lay-by. With his throat cut. One of my old foot soldiers is getting uppity. Thinks he can knock me off my perch. I'll know which one it is pretty soon and then we're gonna fuck him up real bad! It's not my beef, I've had enough! I'll give back your house, your car. We'll be through. - Just pay me first! - What for? I did the job, the rest's vis major, it's not my fault! Vis major? The fuck you prattling about? They know I was there. They could pin the killing on me! But if I go down, you go down with me! And if we go down, your son will, too! - Márk? - How many others you got? - He nicked 50 million off me! - How could he do that? That job you wouldn't do. Gyáli Road. At least he had the balls for it. Fuck were you thinking of? A kid! He could've been killed! He was ashamed his dad had turned so fucking yellow! And now, Little Atti, get the fuck out of here PDQ. - Klári... - What more do you want? You're pregnant by my husband? I'm sorry that's how you feel. I just need some things for my work. Bank passwords, specimen signatures... Wait here! Specimen signature, please! - How much? - 8 million. What's this? - Seems we're moving to Gran's. - What? Dad's flipped. What the hell are you doing? Attila! That time your son crashed his bike and cut himself up... - Know where he'd been? - Where? In that shot-up car we saw on the news! - What? - He did that job for Hollós. - What job? - The one he offered me! Right here! Said all I had to do was drive. And you stuck your oar in: Oh, there's no risk. Okay, but he was alright, wasn't he? They shot that car to fuck! He could've died! Our wonderful Endre nearly killed your son! - So someone else is to blame? Again! - No, I'm to blame, too. I should've knocked his block off long ago! We're through with Hollós. We'll delete his number, give him everything back. Dad! It's not Uncle Endre's fault! - I asked him for work! - And he gladly obliged, huh? - Oh, Christ, Márk, how could you...? - I needed the pocket money! - I've always given you pocket money! - Yeah, but how much? And them fines: bad marks, backchat, any kind of crap. - You took it all back in a week! - But why didn't you tell us? You want me to beg for a shitty 10 or 20 thou - when you're the kings of bling? - Leave it! They'll never get it. Fuck you surprised at? Fuck did you expect? - You watch your mouth! - Why? Fuck you gonna do about it? That's your answer? Fuck you both! Well... See? That's where it's got us. What? Are you all there? Living dishonestly. You what? The examples you both show. Are you surprised Márk's turned into a criminal? - We are not criminals. - Really? Since when? All I've done has been for you two! So you don't wear rags, - so you can go to a good school! - Who asked you to? The little whinger! Fuck you. You haven't a clue what we really need! You're so hung up on fighting you don't care shit for us! You've got the sauce to talk like that to me? Why? Think you know anything about us? Know I got that blitzed I woke up in detox? I was that out of it any infected perv might have raped me. Know Márk smacked his PE teacher up and got expelled? - He did what? - See! That's how much you take any notice of us! So I'm to blame that you drank yourself unconscious? Yeah, you are! And so are you! And so are the lies we had to grow up with! Well, bugger me! Is this why we spoiled them rotten? - You wanted to live like this! - Me? Oh, sure! How long have I been saying I want a respectable job? - So we can be poor? - Poor? The fuck you on about? - If we've no jacuzzi then we're poor? - Is that all this means to you? Márk was only put in danger cos you wanted out. Cos you lost your bottle! Cos you're just a gutless wimp! You've got a nerve! Getting on Dad's case... when you're nothing but a whore! What did you say? Yeah, I saw you snogging that fatwad bloke of yours. What? Gonna slap me, too? - Don't you speak to me like that! - Oh? Why not? Because I'm your mother! I hadn't noticed! This is all that's kept us together this long. We'll pay off the debt and then we can go our separate ways. It'll be best for everyone. I am not going back to a tower block. I'm not starting all over again. I'll get the mop. We've got to clean this up. Hello. I told you: I'm yours. Aren't you coming? - Sorry! - Yes? - Sorry, I'm looking for Oszi. - She's not here. - Isn't she on night shift? When will she come? - She won't. - When's she next working? - She's not. She's been fired! - Hi! - Wazzap? I was at the hospital. They said... - They don't know yet. - But what happened? Nothing. They sussed I'd been in the hazardous waste. Then you got kicked out cos of me. It was my idea. I'm dead sorry. Shit happens. At least there's nothing to stop me going now. - Where? - London. I've mates there. They're on 5 times as much. No one would bitch me out. Or if they did, I'd not understand a word of it. And you'd leave everything behind? There's nothing to leave! Nothing and no one I care about... Yeah... There's nothing to keep me here now either. I'm going with you! - Evening! - Good evening! Thank you. Now, what's the score? A dog-walker found it at about 9:30. Thank you. You're fucking familiar! How do? We've met before. Nándor Tomcsa. It's all up for your boss. It's not just his trucks I'm after. I'm gonna take it all, bit by bit. - Think I care? - Listen. It's gonna get nasty. There'll be all sorts of collateral damage. What do you want from me? Come and work for me! - I don't work for anyone anymore. - You can't stay out of it. Either you're with me or you'll be history, just like him. Attila! I'll see you alright. I'll give you 10 million for starters. And what's worth that much to you? Endre Hollós. All you've got to do is... and the money's yours. And I'll trust you.
