 We'll go back to the dogs' home tomorrow and choose you a new one. Mira? Leave me alone! Well? You cannot steal living creatures. I wanted to go to a breeder. Oh, sure, wasting a fortune on a dog! While I get to drive a Skoda. I'm not going to prison for a dog. Or for a Mercedes. Then how do you plan to keep all this up? So you remembered where you live? Mira, come down! There's cake! Come and have some! It's delicious! Oh, my God! What's happened to you? Oh, God! - So the minibus pulled out. And then? - I crashed into it. That's it...

 - This'll sting a bit. - Who had right of way? - Him or you? Wasn't there a sign? - Yeah, there was! You'll soon be right as rain. - So there was a sign? - Yeah, there was a sign. Then you didn't have right of way. - Just get off my back! - Yes, leave him alone! - Take this before you go to bed. - What is it? For the hurts to your soul. It'll help you relax. Now go on up. What was that in aid of? Remember that game we had in Salgótarján? That chap was dealt a pair of aces, I had three shiny diamonds. Then on the flop he got three of a kind, and I got that fourth shiny diamond... And remember that sucker? He'd come about 1000 km, showing off in his Maserati, - then... - Re-raise. - You what? - I re-raise. - Okay, you do that... The third hand, he creamed himself when he saw his ace-king and he went all-in. Well, after that he could go straight home. - Sorry. - What now? You've invited a star guest? I sent the male strippers over to your place. Smashing. - Sorry. I'll be back in a minute. - Okay. - Fold for me. - Alright. - It went wrong, Uncle Endre! - Fuck's up? I said no calls! They chased us, they shot at us. We crashed. - That guy, that Gyukó... - Are you okay? I am, but... Just take your tablets, Mother, and try to sleep. I'll call you tomorrow. Night-night. - Good evening. Endre Hollós? - That's me. Forgive me if I don't invite you in, but I'm entertaining... Let's walk a little. Inspector Zsolt Komáromi, Budapest Police Organized Crime Squad. And how can I be of assistance at such a very late hour? It's about an incident involving a Ford Mondeo, KIG-323. It's registered as being owned by Ultrasped Ltd. If you say so! Do you know how many cars are in the firm's fleet? The car has been found in the vicinity of Soroksári Road, it's badly smashed up. With bullet marks on the body. It had earlier been involved in a pursuit. - It was stolen? - We both know that it wasn't. I beg your pardon? This isn't about forged customs seals or tax dodges anymore, Mr Hollós. You have overstepped a boundary. Look, Inspector, if you're accusing me of something, please be explicit. But spare me your insinuations. And now, if you will excuse me, I have guests. I'm sure you're aware that patience isn't one of Pali Szilágyi's strong points. Enjoy your party! Do you have to play that shit... - ...at top fucking volume? - Yeah. I do. What's up, only got an A-minus in your geography test? - Wanker! - Bitch! Trees rush by, you're outta sight, don't matter shit, how hard ya try. On death's superstrada ain't no speed limit tonight, no barriers: be on your guard, if ya run off the track, you'll get fucked real hard. You're a survivor, reality knocks: life's no game on your shitty Xbox. End of the road, can't start again, no rescue truck or marks out of ten. The reset or the trigger, schmuck, which ya pull, I don't give a fuck! Wassup bro? We've got to shoot a video! I've got this badassical fucking idea! And the deposit? If anything happens to it. Insurance, savvy? Look after it, you get it back. School don't teach about real life, forget it, kid, open your eyes. A couple more years then it's game over, bro ya swallow their scraps like a seal in a show, and if they one day give ya parole, life sells ya lies, that's the dope. So put the pedal to the metal and get ready to roll. Ya feel your heart's bust apart then ya see it's for real: hanging from the rear-view mirror of your life dangling like motherfucking blood-soaked furry dice! And how'd you come up with the words? Well... I'm feeling kinda dark right now. It's meta, Marky G style, you dig? We'll soon get it edited and then you can watch it. Big Mac? - Love to, but I'm busy. - Come on. You can jack off any time. It's my grandpa's funeral. Sorry. - Want me to go with you? - Nah. - For your trouble. - Thanks. Fuck, someone's loaded. Follow me, bitches! I was talking to Samu. You rock, G! When the video's ready we'll upload it to our webpage. We've already got 2000 likes. - And the deposit? - What deposit? Don't razz me, man. It's not my cash! - Foul! - Play on! Let's have the ball! 20 burpees each for the losing team, well done the winners! Next match is Tuesday. One... two... three... four... - Where's my mobile? - What? - Fuck, it's gone... - What's the problem? - She's stolen my mobile! - Me? Are you stupid? - You were sitting there before! - What if I was? - Runs in the family don't it? - Cool it, Luca! Why? Her dad really did pinch Áron Trencsényi's dog! - He didn't! He got him from the dogs' home! - Yeah, right! But he did. He got out and... ...from the dogs' home. I asked Dad not to buy me a dog, - I wanted to find a stray... - Luca! Isn't this it? It had slipped under the bench. Twenty! Alright into the dressing room with you! No catching cold today. Stop daydreaming, Mira! It's time to go! - Please! - Coming! You've said that ten times. Hurry up! Is everything alright? Come on, look lively! Are we going to have this all day? You might at least take that chain off. We take our leave of Major General Mihály Miklósi. Throughout his life he stood by his comrades, and adored his wife, Éva, and his children, Tibor and András. He was a soldier, and a loving husband, father, and grandfather. He was ever conscious of himself, his actions, and his portion in life, and he avowed his faults and his virtues alike. For him, his personal life and his duties to his homeland were inextricably intertwined... - My condolences. - Thank you. Coming back to Mum's? No can do, Atti. Thanks for coming. - When can we talk? - My condolences. - Thank you for coming. It's kind of you. - My condolences. - My condolences. - Thank you. Oh, Lord... My sweet Lord... Remember this? Dad's watch. I was never allowed to touch it. It's yours. - Have you seen Ildikó? - Why? What about her? Mamm's the word... I don't usually study my cousin's breasts. - Well, now's your chance. - Stop staring! Why didn't you bring your dog, Mira? - He's dead. - How's that? - He didn't suffer too much. - Yes he did. It was hell. Oh, well... just carry on playing. Lacika! Have a cake! No? Are you sure? Remember that time in Siófok... when we had to do a bunk when the real owner of the apartment showed up? I feel sick. They made out it was a game. I threw a fit when I couldn't go back for my inflatable killer whale. You think it's funny? That we live like this? Who says we can't? Everyone's hustling, aren't they? ...in the tree house. It's lovely outside! Atti tells me he's getting out of the property business. - Well, it's not 100 per cent yet. - Says you. The market's kaput. We'd have to take bigger and bigger risks and I'd rather find something with more security. What about your Uncle Robi? Shall I call him for you? They must need engineers at City Hall. We're entrepreneurs, Gran! He's not settling for peanuts in the public sector. Márkó? Hi! You alright? Ah, you know... Grandpa. Yeah, it's sad... Ciggie? No, thanks. They'd kill me if they saw. They'll kill me anyway. What's it like in there? - My little Tibi! - Mother. - Sweet little Tibi! - Hello! - How lovely you're here! - Hello! - Hi. - Hi! Hello. - You're looking good. - Thanks. So are you. Hi. The funeral was at one. Something came up. I had to change my plans. Well, it can't be helped. - Where are your bags? - At my hotel. You won't stay here? I'd only need to make the bed... Don't tire yourself. I don't want to be any trouble. Oh, no, not you. Sit down and I'll bring some cakes. Straight from Munich? Yeah. But now I'll be in Budapest for a while. I'm doing an attic renovation in Rózsa Street. And the bastards'll rob me blind if I'm not there. Attila's in property, too. Know any good foremen? I fired mine this morning. Get the kids. We're leaving! Huh, he had the time to fire his foreman. At least Tibi's making an effort. - Our father's just died! - At least he knows what he wants. If we want to achieve what he has, we've got to be like him. He doesn't give a shit for anyone! All he cares about is money. Just like everyone in this family. Mira, how many times must I tell you? Chooker... Who's talking about Chooker? My whole life's shit. Cos of you! Did you see his car? Don't start, okay? I still can't believe you really want to be a... pen-pusher. - That was never on our bucket list. - No, and neither was... Forget it. What? Writing Swindler at the top of your CV? Mira! Don't treat us like idiots, Mum! - We've never lied to you. - Oh, sure! You couldn't be honest if you tried. Come back! What are you doing? Leave her be. Let's go. Jobmarket Hello, Mervarik Holding. How can I help you? Good afternoon, my name's Attila Miklósi. I'm enquiring about the construction engineer's vacancy... I can put you through to the project team. - They're very busy, but I'll try. - Can I call back later? - Of course! - Thank you! Want to tell me what this is? With pleasure. The bill for putting our garden straight. You really think it was me who wrecked that tree? - Wasn't it? - Damn it all! This is the green belt! It's swarming with rodents! You don't imagine I'm going to pay this? - No, I don't. - Then what the hell do you want? Proof that I have tried to reach a compromise with you. What can I get you? Haven't you got any plasters? I'll take a look. And some kind of pain killer? Can I have a glass of cold milk? - Driving? - Not me. Then order a proper drink, for Pete's sake. Alright, and what's that? According to you? That depends. I guess it's not your feet that are the problem. A guy? No. So? It's just... People are idiots. We'll figure something out, okay? - Sour cherry with honey. - How much? 650. - You having one, too? - It ain't easy for me, either... Cheers! Ooh! It's nice. Really. No, no, hang on. I haven't got enough. Then you can do the washing up. You hate washing up that much? Cos we need a helper. Four hours and 5000 an evening. And you do seem to be a bit short. I left my purse at home. I'll come back with it. This one's on me. - The bottle stays here. - You don't have to... Yes, I do. People are real idiots. Get your bikes out, please. Leave your bikes outside and then you can come in. No, take them out. Hello Kitty, out on the prowl? Yeah, I'm looking for some dirty little rats... to kill. Wow, rock hard chick! Miaow? Gunfire and a car chase in Budapest! The driver of the vehicle behind me is believed to have lost control after having been pursued by an SUV through District 19 - for several kilometres... - There's some left-over pizza. The police have launched a hunt for the man pictured in this composite... - Shall I warm it up? ...who fired a number of shots at the other car... - Shall I warm it up? As yet unverified sources suggest a mafia showdown... - Or do you want something cold? - Uh-huh... The crime scene investigation is still ongoing and further information is yet to be disclosed. A family of owls has moved into the garden of... So which? You never take a blind bit of notice of me. - Okay. - Fancy! Uh-huh. Wanna see what it's like... inside? What exactly? We don't want any misunderstandings... Well, are you coming then? Come on... Hello! I'm home! That is... we're home. - Hello! - Good evening! - One of your classmates? - Nah... This is Nándi. Norbert Tihanyi. Oh, yeah, Norbert. I knew it began with N. - Mira! Have you been drinking? - No, thanks. We're going up. Think she has? She could hardly stand. I didn't know your folks'd be home. They're always home. - They seem pretty cool. - Well they're not. This your dog? No. - Go and see what they're up to! - Can't you guess? So that's it? Well, I can't just barge in on them, can I? No... no... not that one... shitty thing... Janka, come here... Maybe you should go up. You'd better go now. You on Facebook? Uh-huh... - Great. I'll add you, then. - Uh-huh... Right, enough is enough. Thanks for everything. Goodnight. And what do this... Norbi's parents do? What do they do, or how much do they earn? - Have you known each other long? - Uh-huh. At least an hour and a half. I see... Do you think you'll see him again? So, what was it in aid of? Can't I even try to have a good time? And that means bringing home a boy from some... council estate? Alright, then next time I'll go to the... council estate! You know that's not what I meant. Or we could do it at the train station, if that'd suit you better! - How is she? - She'll sleep it off. And you? Are you alright? I've got some job interviews tomorrow. Well, if that's really what you want. I don't care. You know best. You do what you like! If you can bring home enough to pay for... our clothes, the food, the bills, school... 700,000 a month, net... I don't care. You just do it! But you know the saying, Don't change a winning formula. And how about Quit while you're at the top? Huh! This is the top? That shooting thing that was on the news... That car... It was Hollós's. - How'd you know that? - I've got a feeling. But he was there at the funeral. He must be alright. I don't know who did the job in the end. When a caper's on, he always plays poker at home for his alibi. So who cares? You heard what they said on TV! The police are going all out. Let them. They've got to make a living too. What could they do, anyway? Take you in for 24 hours? Big deal! But they're such a bunch of boobs! Some flatfoot was here yesterday about that stupid tree... The police were round here? So? Don't worry. I blamed it all on the Salamon twins! Janka... Was it you who butchered that tree? Good evening! Good evening. And do I get any explanation? I apologise on my wife's behalf, too. - She sometimes has a false sense of reality. - We'd noticed. Are we sorted then? I won't file a complaint, if that's what you mean. Thank you. All the same, one cannot forget such things that easily. Wait... just a moment... That little sortie of yours has just cost me 200,000 forints. - You're an idiot for paying him. - What else could I have done? A bit of police attention now would go down a treat! Oh, don't bawl me out over a stupid tree! Listen, I've always been tolerant, but this is the limit! You wanted this house: here we are. I only asked for one thing in return. No scandals. You don't know what that woman did to me! What could she do to provoke a response like that? What? She humiliated me! Me! Before everyone! You've no idea what I do to give you such an easy life! You've done nothing for 15 years but sit on your arse! What about raising your children? - Running the household? - I should grovel to you cos you phone for a pizza once a week? Fucking big help that is! And you're that bored you go around creating problems! - So that's what you think of me? - Dead right! You didn't list any previous workplaces on your CV. Well, I haven't been working in the trade for a while. But rather? You graduated as an engineer, but in your portfolio - I can't find your ECDL certificate. - My what? What makes you feel that now is the time to change? It's hard to say exactly... Tell me about your most rewarding professional experience! If you were to describe yourself as an animal, what would you be, and why? A fawn? Yes. Maybe a fawn. What are your salary expectations? 700,000 a month, net. Did I say net? I meant gross. Gross. What is your weakest point during conflict management? Uncle Endre... Atti? I never meant to leave you in the shit. What should I say now? I'm sorry. Really. Dad gave it to you? Uh-huh. It's not going. I know. I don't want us to be on bad terms. You're the only one I've got. Listen... You wanted a foreman. Still need one? No, I found a bloke. Anything else going? Who's asking? Me. Hello, Klári! I've drawn up a communications strategy for the next half-year. I can present it at Tuesday's meeting. - Are you being serious? - Yes. Why? Did you really imagine you could just remain among us as if nothing had happened? Foundation members are decent, pure-minded people, not the likes of... You miserable, conniving old shit! You'll not get away with it! I'll make sure you lot clear out of this neighbourhood! You're parasites, the lot of you... I'll have you locked up and... Help! Someone call an ambulance! Good God! What's happened? Where are we going? Go on... What are we doing here? What is this place? Uncle Endre? Thanks for running out on me! You... you... I thought... I thought that... I called you, Uncle Endre! Straight away! Where's my money? When I came to, this runt was nowhere. And neither was the bag. I only just got out, the pigs were all over. It's sure this... That's not true! It's sure this little... It's sure he swiped it! That's not true! It was like this... When I came to after the crash, I looked to see how he was. I thought he was dead, so... Uncle Endre, I... Fucking chickenshit... The bag. Was it still there? Bag? Dunno... I never knew there was any bag. So you don't know anything about the money? Then bugger off home. We'll say no more about it. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
