 Márk! When was the last time you saw him? That's not me. Oh, no? So who's the driver? Your evil twin? Alright, let's start again. Where were you and Gyuka going? Hmm? Listen, Márk. I know none of this is your doing. You got mixed up in one of Endre Hollós's dodgy capers. All you did was drive. Okay. All the same, you're in serious trouble. A lot of things go against you. But I think I can help. All you've got to do

 is tell me honestly what happened that evening. I was at the circus. This isn't a game, Márk! I dunno what you're on about! A witness saw you in the woods. Carrying a spade. She recognized your picture. You can't explain that away! - It wasn't me! - This... Right! Unless that's your alibi! He gave me that for Christmas 6 years ago. He made it in his craft lesson. If he's so important to you, why'd you drag him into it? Get him to drive for you when he's not even got a licence! And on a dicey job like that! My lad nearly died cos of you! I refused, so that was your revenge? What are you on about, Attila? You think I knew we'd be attacked? If I had, I'd not have asked you, let alone Márk! Like fuck! All you care about's money! Okay, you're right. I was an idiot. I shouldn't have got Márk mixed up in it. You're a maggot. A lowdown scumbag. So now you're gonna shoot me? Hmm? Is that the answer? Come on, then, do it! Do it! Come on! Shoot me! If even you pull a gun on me, Atti, who the fuck can I trust? All it needs is a witness to sign it. The house is yours. I wanted to put it in the kids' names, but my solicitor said it'd be tricky cos they're minors. Fuck it all, you're the only ones I've got! I don't know how it all got screwed up this way! From now on, I'll leave you all in peace. Márk, too. I'll not ask for a thing. We'll leave business out of it. Friendship's far more important. What's with the pistol, Atti? It doesn't bleeding suit you! - Tomcsa gave me it. - What? It was Tomcsa hijacked the truck at the border. The little toerag! He was just a grease monkey a few years back! I gave him his first car wash! Now he wants to stab me in the back? Then he asked me to... And you said yes. Nice. What were you thinking of, Attila? You're no killer! Shoot, Endre! How do, Pali! We missed you last week. Skirt-chasing, were you? No, more's the pity! I was in Brussels. Parliamentary Offices But I'll be there on Friday. I do hope so. It's deadly dull winning every hand. I can't really talk now. Why'd you call? It's turned out who that well-wisher of mine is. - Undersecretary! - Enjoy your meal, DCS! - Thank you. Sorry! - Go ahead and finish it. You have my full attention! Alright, maybe you didn't kill him. But you helped to dispose of the body and there's a pile of circumstantial evidence. As an accessory... you could get 8 years. That's a hell of a long time, Márk! The best years of your life. But if you help me now, maybe I can help you. You say you didn't shoot him. Okay, I believe you. So who did? Hollós? Or your father? Dad? He's got nothing to do with it! You sure? Because he's a well-known crony of Hollós's. And somebody fired that pistol. Either your dad or Hollós. Was it your father? No. He wasn't there. He had no idea I knew Gyuka. Who's this? A witness in the Hollós case. - How old are you? - 17. Nearly 18. - Where's his lawyer? - He's cracking! Questioning minors alone! It's my arse'll get kicked if it gets out! I'll offer him a plea bargain. We can get at Hollós. Forget Hollós! That's a dead end. - What? We've got a murder. - Nándor Tomcsa, he's our target now. Tomcsa? That little no-mark...? He's our border killer. He was behind the Gyáli Road shooting, too. But they attacked Hollós's car! The two are connected. Leave Hollós alone, understand? We've been building this case up for 2 years! If that kid talks... That's an order! This is what we've got on Tomcsa. Read it! I want your strategic plan by tomorrow morning. The forensics report! It says Gyuka was buried by two people. One was you, but who was the other one? - What size shoes does your dad take? - It's nothing to do with Dad! My chief reckons it was your dad. He's just told me to bring him in. But... As you like it, Márk. Alright... If you guarantee Dad'll be left out of it, I'll tell you everything. - Will you guarantee it? - That depends. On what? If on the basis of your statement, we can pin the murder on Hollós, you two will get off scot free. Hmm? Don't wreck the fucking place! You shut the fuck up! or I'll fuck you up. - Fuck's sake, cool it. - Fuck you. Ow! Don't fucking hit me. God's fucking bollocks! What gear is it? How the fuck should I fucking know Fuck you gawping at? Help me fucking look for it! - Its okay. He's just got the horrors. - What? He'll calm down when he's had his fix. Have you got the water? Thank fuck! It was here! Why'd someone put that fucking shit on it? - I've already used it. - Then rinse the fucking thing! - What's it like? - Fuck knows... Aren't you hot? Tea or coffee? - You be careful! - Ah, go fuck yourself! - Off to the shop? Bring us some cream! - Can't. Hey, Oszi, who's your girlfriend? Can I get some? Get this! Hi, Oszi. Hi! Thanks. - Almost. - Almost! And this? - What's that? - Real good. - Cool. - Cool! I dig it! Yeah. Literally, it means something's not hot. Listen, say this: Can I have a cup of cool coffee? - That's too hard! - No it's not, you can do it! No... Yeah? When? Okay, triff! - We can go for our interview! - Brill! When? - 2 p.m. at Izabella Street. - Great! Don't reckon they'll like these pyjamas, though! Did he give you it? Did he? Then where's it from? The foundation. What's up, late for your date? Don't you want to go for a smoke? I'll call you. We can't give up now when all our worries have been solved. What's been solved, Attila? We've no more debt. We've been waiting 20 years for this. And what about tomorrow? And the day after that? Hmm? How are we going to live? 20 years and we've got nowhere. The house is ours. Christ, Attila, you don't feel how pathetic it is? That's what you wanted. You wanted the house! But I wanted it from you. Not Endre! Where are you in this? Where's Attila Miklósi? Where? Listen... Doesn't it bother you that it's Endre who's keeping us? He's given us everything! Loans, work, - his house, his car... - I worked for it! And every time you screw up, suddenly the Great Saviour, Endre Hollós, appears and saves us. Okay, I messed a lot up, but that's over. We're through with Hollós. From today, I'll only think of you three. You're important to me, Janka. We're a pair, you and me. Why pretend, Attila? It's the two of you who've kept this family. You two make only one man. Thank you, goodbye. The Miklósis! You both have to sign in 3 places. Let me give you another pen! Thank you. That's your copy. Well, then, that's that! Congratulations! You are free! - Congratulations! - Goodbye. Mira won't answer. She texted me last night. She slept at a friend's. With school the next day? She never used to do that. I guess they were studying till late. Which way are you going? That way. Bye, then. Bye. So if it's not yours, whose is it? What's not stolen belongs to my dad's mate. Who's some kind of gangster. My mum's the worst. All she cares about is appearances. She makes Dad sweat blood so's she can swank. And he lets himself be henpecked... If you live in a place like this, who cares where it's all from? This place? It's like an outlet store. Dad's trying to sell everything. - How does this look? - Awesome! - And me? - You want to go in trousers? Why not? Here! Put this on! Well? Cute! Now let's flash a bit of cleavage! There's nothing to flash! Push up! Then he said I should go with him to the meet with Gyuka. - With Krisztián Gyurkovics? - Yeah, him. And? Where was that meet? A car park on Sori Road, behind the depot. Why did you go there? Uncle Endre... Endre Hollós wanted to clear up why he'd not been told about the money. And then? We went there, Gyuka was... Krisztián Gyurkovics was already there... Uh-huh. And then? What happened then? What happened, Márk? What work experience have you got? - I worked in the health sector. - A nurse? - I did the cleaning. - That's great! I wouldn't say that exactly! They've got more than enough skilled workers already. - Marital status? - Single. - Live with your parents? - I've never met my dad. My mum's in this village, Tarján, but we've not spoken for 3 years. - Can you speak English? - One or two words. Other languages? Romany. A little. But I've started learning English. Couple of months and I'll know - enough to avoid them selling me. - Sure... And they run cheap language courses especially for foreign workers. That's cool! - And you? - I'm still studying. - Where? - High school. - Which one? - Kempelen Grammar. - Where's that? - District 12. It's bilingual. Do your parents know you're here? Can you speak English? Oszi! - Is that really what I should call you? ! Uh-huh! Okay! There's a vacancy here... for a housekeeper, but they need someone who speaks English... so what you'd be most suited for would be agriculture... Crop-picking. Apples, potatoes, strawberries... It's pretty tough physical work. No sweat, as long as it pays well. Does it? About 700 pounds a month. Out of that comes board and keep, so you'd be left with 400 pounds for yourself. That sounds alright. But... I do know a much better opportunity. - I'm all ears! - It's a whole lot of work, - but a whole lot of money too. Interested? - Sure! Alright! Let's have a coffee! There's a nice little place on the corner. - We can discuss it there. - Okay, let's go! Can I get your ID card? I'll have it photocopied. Okay. And have you got anything for me? The truth is, you're over-qualified. And that housekeeper's job? - Too young. - But I mean it, anything'll do me. I've even worked in a pub... Believe me, this isn't for you. I'll bring it back in a sec, okay? Come with us, we'll soften him up! - And where will I stay? - In Leyton. The rooms aren't that big, and you'll be sharing with two others, but when I'm over each month, you can sleep at my place. See? You're picking up the lingo already. Like my shoes pick up dogshit! Shall we go? You go! Me and Peti still wanna practise our English! - Sure you're not coming? - Get off her case! Can't you let us enjoy our business meeting? You just go, it's okay, really! We can meet later. I'll call you. Huh? Cool. Leave it, it's on me. You're alright. Thanks to our sponsors' generous assistance, we can finally open this brand-new hostel for 80 residents. The work, the planning, and the grant applications all go back to the time of our former chairlady, Klári Tóth. I believe that were it not for Klári's enthusiasm, know-how, and unbelievably hard work, we would not be here today. We thank her for that... and also for the fact that in spite of her illness, she has joined us to celebrate this occasion. Thank you, Klári. And now let me hand you over to those for whom this place was intended! Please give a warm welcome to... the Shelter Cultural Association Homeless Band! - That was a very nice speech. Thank you! - I'm glad you could come! I doubt that! You only made one tiny mistake. The text notifications of foundation bank transactions still get sent to my number. You forgot to change it. I don't quite know what you mean. And I don't quite know why you needed 8 million from the foundation account. This isn't the time or place... Then where is? The police station? I shall report on our financial year at the next meeting! Really? Wonderful! You'll report on the embezzlement of our funds? Why must you always assume the worst? What other explanation is there? Why did you need that 8 million? I've invested it. I found an option with MaxInvest. The construction's complicated, I won't go into it now. But the sum invested will be doubled in 6 months. It's due to company tax regulations, I'll not bore you with it. Congratulations! This place is top-class! Even the toilets have got disabled access! - So it's worth supporting us? - Absolutely. Janka couldn't tell us the exact details of that wonderful investment construction. You know dear, that foundation money we put into MaxInvest. Oh, that! Of course! But what exactly is it? Interest-free loans for NPOs mean tax write-offs for us. And we can also reduce our corporate tax base. Why shell out to the state if we can give to charity instead? - So why the need for the investment? - It's just a bookkeeping device. The money had to appear on our account as self-financing. And will that sum really be doubled? Precisely. Twice the amount of liquid capital will be returned once it has gone through accounting. We'll get 16 million? Approximately. Based on last year's rates. Maybe 15. That would enable us to finish the warming centre, too. That's marvellous! - Thank you, Kálmán! - You are most welcome! Let's go, dear! Saint Margaret Emergency Hostel - Thank you. - And? Now you want me to transfer 16 million to a bunch of bums? Only 15... you're a great haggler. Janka, that's an incredible amount. Can't you write it off your tax? It doesn't work like that. You cannot put me in such tight spots. - Maybe you could do it with your husband... - I've got the message! What did you need the money for? It was the price of my being able to leave home. To be with you. You're a smooth operator! I have no idea what you mean! Uh-huh... Well, I shan't be bored with you around! You can bet on that, dear! I hate it! I simply cannot be properly angry with you! You'll learn! At last! Awesome, huh? Peti took me shopping, then we got my hair done. He paid for my nails, too. French acrylics! - Class! - The manicure was wicked! Ever had one? Mum took me once. It's not my thing. - Shit! - What's up? - I left my ID with Peti! - Why give him it in the first place? Why d'you think? For my visa application! - You don't need a visa for England. - You do if you're gonna work there. - For your work permit or something. ! Uh-huh. - When are you leaving? - Friday? - That soon? - Uh-huh! The minibus is picking us up at Nyugati Station. Minibus? You're going to London in a minibus? Basle. Get him! I reckon he's looking at you! What's Basle got to do with anything? - The pay's better. - But what's the work? You'll not be digging spuds in Basle. Not with acrylic nails! We'll see. - The whole thing stinks! - What? That bloke, that Peti. He's dead fishy. I reckon he's alright. Listen, Oszi... You hear loads of stories like this. They take girls abroad and steal their documents, and then force them to have sex. They're not forcing anyone to do anything. - But I saw a... - It's all been sorted. So you're going there to...? It pays 10 times what all the other jobs do. And it's not for ever! 6 months, say. I'll be able to save up enough for a course. I could learn manicure or something. Don't do it, Oszi! Don't go with him! - What fucking choice have I? - I dunno... We could - look for a proper... - You've got a choice! Elite school, private lessons, the works. But me? I can spend the rest of my life scrubbing spew in detox! Or do this for 6 months. Well, I'd rather do this! Alright, Márkó? What's this...? Good afternoon! Afternoon! What can I do for you? He's made a detailed confession. He could be facing up to 8 years. - Was my wife there? - Your wife? Cos I know I wasn't. And cos my son's still a minor he should have been questioned with a guardian present. So you can wipe your arse with that confession. That's for the judge to decide. But I doubt he'll ignore such revealing material. We've been building this case for 2 years. Do you know how much it's cost? Everyone wants results. - What do you want from me? - Márk's not a criminal. Neither are you. You've just got the wrong friends. Who are no friends at all. Hollós doesn't give two shits about you. And now he's using your son, too! The prisons are full of expendable losers like you two. I'm sick of simply sending the dopes down. Attila! If you help me get Hollós, you two will remain free. Both of you will receive immunity. You're bluffing! You've got an empty hand! ...he said we'd that we wanted to rob him. Then he took out his gun... He turned towards me. He said he wanted to teach me a lesson... And then... he shot Gyuka. - Gyurkovics... - Krisztián Gyurkovics. - Did he die immediately? - Yeah. For sure. His brains... were splattered everywhere. What happened next? We buried him. Who's we? Me and Endre Hollós. You waste someone in front of my son, then make him bury the corpse? - He's a fucking child! - I had no other choice! Why did you have to get him involved at all? He was already involved! Tomcsa swiped two full trucks! So you offed Gyuka in front of him? - The cunt was trying to rip me off! - But why make Márk bury him? There was only the two of us there. It was getting light! Right, that'll do! I reckon that's enough, thank you! Let's go! Turn around! Turn around! Hands up! On the back of your head! Move it! Playing the Lone Ranger? They'll not thank you, you ponce! You've pissed up the wrong tree! Oh, yes? Not even your scumbag mates in parliament will protect a murderer. Alright, come on. - He's not going anywhere! - I did what you asked! He's an accessory to a murder. I'm taking him in. - We agreed! - Miklósi! Get out of here before I arrest you, too! What the hell are you doing? Hey! Freeze! Get back in the car... Freeze! Are you all mad? Stop there! Freeze! Don't move! - Stop fucking about! - Put it down! Put it down! Give it here! You quit that!
