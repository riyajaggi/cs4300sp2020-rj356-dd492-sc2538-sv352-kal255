 Okay, let's go. - Got this for you. - What is it? - Walnuts. - Thanks. You just left the money in a jam jar. You'd never see that in Budapest! Hey! We've got to check out. We're alright until noon. I asked. Atti! Don't! Oh, God, no...! - I still stink of dead pig. - Who cares? I need a shower. Sorry. Rise and shine! Where's my dough? - It's not here. - But we agreed it would be. Or I'd beat your fucking brains out. Remember? Old school's that hip, is it? Take the car! Hang on, wait... I want another 21 mil. I'll be back for it tonight. My folks'll be home... The car park under the flyover at 8. Where we first met. I remember. I know who you are. Why are you here? - Mind your backs. - Excuse me! - Excuse me! - Mind your backs. Look lively, come on. Here we are. Do you want him? - What are you doing here? - Sorry, I just... - No wandering about, okay? - I want to go home. Detoxification costs 7200 forints, you'll have to pay it first. - I can't find my purse. - It's been boxed up. - Have you seen Dr Veres? - No. ! Alright, come with me, then. Fuck. Hollós called. He's been released. I'm going to pick him up, then we could do something together. That's what our romantic weekend was for. I've got a meeting. Again? Yeah, again. - Did you lock it? - Of course. I didn't hear it beep. - Hello-hello! - Hi! - What's new, Plum? - Oh, nothing... - Mira? - Search me... What's happened to you? Let me see! Nothing... Have you been in a fight? Come on... I got a basketball in the mush. You don't play basketball! Now I know why... Put some ice on it! I'm not daft. I know what you've been up to! What? I must have been about your age when I got into it. Thanks to Uncle Endre. He was at it like a pro by then. I wanted to tell you. I swear I did. I guess it's too late now. - So what now, then? - What can we do? I might be strict, but I'm not an ogre. One time I woke up in a ploughed field. I hadn't a clue how I'd got there. Then it turned out that Endre had hot-wired your granddad's car. Not that I'm proud of it, mind. Just so you know. You can enjoy yourself. You're young! All I ask is that we be straight with each other. Alright? Sure. A few drinks now and again won't hurt. In moderation, naturally. I'll even help you shift the bottles afterwards. But don't just dump the empties in the street. Okay? Alright, that's enough preaching. I'll make you some hangover soup with extra sauerkraut, then I'll whup you on the Xbox. That'd be brill, but I've got to get going. Shame. Where? Gotta sort something out. They'll kill me if I'm late. No probs, off you go, then. Bye-bye! Are you sexually active? Why's that important? The lab test showed only ethanol in the blood. But after the acute phase, tryptamine derivatives can't be detected. What... Pardon? You were brought in unconscious. Some might take advantage of a girl in such a state. We've seen it plenty of times. So I'm recommending a gynaecological check-up. I'll write you a referral. I feel really sick. Well, yes, that's par for the course. When can I go home? I'll print your outpatient's record. But the national health won't cover your treatment. If detox was free it'd bankrupt us. It's at it again! Referral You okay? You look like shit. - I feel dizzy. - You need some water fucking quick. The taps don't work. Better? Thanks. I think I'd better go home now. - Someone picking you up? - Well... My folks are away. It's better they don't know anyway... Boyfriend? Friends? My brother... Call him! - My credit's burned down. - Mine too. But someone's charging in the nurses' room. Come on! - Well look who's here! - Hi, Gran! What's happened to you? - Nothing. I fell off my bike. - Ooh, why can't you be more careful? Good you didn't crack any teeth. Now, let's get some Dettol on it! - I'm alright... - No, you're not. Come on! Oh my Lord, it's almost noon and lunch is nowhere near ready! Want to stick them in? My fingers are so stiff... - Alright, Márkó? - What are you doing here? No one visits for weeks, then I get two guests at the same time. He just appeared without a word of warning the other day. You never liked me living in a hotel. - Well, here I am! - I couldn't even do his room. You've got something on your face! Oh, yeah. He fell off his bike. Just like that? Just like that. He's just like his father. He was always in the wars. And how is he now? Your dad? - Alright. I guess. - Really? That's good. Tibi's going to go to Serbia to build hotels. Isn't that something? Tell him all about that big investment you're doing! - I need a fag. - Lunch'll be ready soon! I'm gonna have to be off, too. What about your lunch? You're skin and bone. - Next time. - Wait a tic! Gran! No! You don't have to. You'll find something to spend it on, won't you? That's settled then. - Hi... It's me. - Cut the crap, alright? It's just... I'm in the toxicology unit... You what? It was like this... They took me to detox and... Detox? You? Don't dick me... Can you come and get me? - Now? - Well... Yeah... Please, Márk! Can't you call someone else? No... Please. I don't want Mum and Dad to... I feel so shitty. Alright, alright, I'm coming. Where are you? Szabolcs Street. I'm on my way. Is he coming? Yeah. Thanks. No worries. Are you a nurse? I'd be better off if I was! By 40 thou a month. I think I'm gonna puke again. Yeah, the alcohol's absorbing through your stomach. You'll soon start feeling better. I've woken up on the plastic myself. It's shit for two days. Then you just hate yourself. End of. What's your name? Oszi. Or Oszkár. Whichever you like. Are you having me on? And you? Mira. - Let's get you a clean T-shirt. - No. Really... Relax, there's loads of them. Pretty chic, huh? How can I get my stuff back? Erzsike'll have it. Don't be scared of her. She's just a tame psycho. Oszi! Oszi, where the hell are you? It was a carefree evening of sparkling conversation. She's here! Sorry. - Hi, come in! - Hello, everyone! Hello, dear! I heard you'd been allowed home. But shouldn't you be resting up? You've got to behave yourself! It looks like I'll survive after all. You're a star, darling! Good God! If I'd known how fat that dress makes me look...! We've never had such press before! You never said you were so pally with the CEO of FerroGlobe! Oh, Dénes? We hit it off immediately. He may just become one of our gold-level sponsors. And today I've a business lunch with Kálmán Csér He's got some tips on EU shortfall grants. - Then I can see to it on Monday. - There'll be no need. Thank you for holding the fort, Janka, but I'm back now. And on Monday I can resume all of the chairlady's duties. Hi! Márk! MY BLOOD YOUR LIFE - Fuck! Have you seen yourself? - Have you? - How could you be so stupid? - Thanks for coming... Hey! It's all in here. - Chasing after you... - These things aren't mine. And this one? Yes. Just a minute. - My money's gone. - Can I help that? You shouldn't have drunk so much. This isn't a cloakroom. But I won't be able to pay. - You can write a money transfer. - How much? - How much is it? - Are you her guardian? - Yeah, I am. - Can you prove that? Will that do you? Sign here. I feel sick. I've got to sit down. It's the stink. Let's get out of here before I start puking, too - Your jacket! - Oh... Hey! Go easy! Come on. The pigeons'll eat it up. I can't go home like this. Uh-huh. We'll sort it. Oh, no! My shoes! This shitty thing's rancid! Like it or lump it! Why go screwing yourself up like this, huh? Will you cover me up? I've got better things to do than play doctors and nurses with you! I'll go get some grub. At least there's someone I can still count on! - How did it go? - Like clockwork. - What's that? - The key to the luggage locker. - The money's at Déli station. - It's usually cash in hand. It always is. DÉLI STATION Fucking hell! How could you be such a prat? How was I to know? It all went just like you said. The bloke was in the lay-by. He knew my name... - Who? What did he look like? - Bit taller than me. Black hair. About 40, maybe a bit younger. - That's a lot of fucking help. - Was I meant to check his ID card? Fuck! That's the second time I've been robbed this month! I dunno who's playing silly buggers, but when I find him... he's dead meat! You and me'll sort him out, Atti! I only... want my money. I really need it. I did my job. This is the best thing that's happened today! It might get even better yet! What are you doing tonight? I've got to work. - At night? - Day and night! Come on! You're the chair. Delegate it to someone else! How do you think I do it? That's the problem. I might not be chair for much longer. Klári, that witch next door, she's back from sick leave and - she wants to take everything off me. - Don't let her! I haven't the faintest what it is you actually do, but that foundation would be a lot less fun without you. Wouldn't it just? I thought I might go through the books. See if I couldn't find any monkey business. You could find that in anyone's books. The trouble is, I don't know the first thing about it. Let me have a look at them for you. Really? We'll sort it, don't you worry. We'll shift the old girl, pronto. She is old, isn't she? An ugly old boot! I just don't know, though. You couldn't even sort out any normal napkins. - May I have a couple of napkins? - On the counter. They don't soak up the grease. I can't help that. One hot dog, one double burger! Shall I get them closed down? I'll send the tax inspectors round. I'll have the shitheap burned down. Bulldozed. Let me show you how it's done. Have you never thought of going into politics? Gyuka! What are you...? Uncle Endre... Hear you had some bother when you were feeding the dogs. Yeah. I'll pay the cunts back. What did they want? Your laptop. Only that? The fucking wankers managed to hack me. But we'll find them, don't you worry. Was it any of this lot? Nah. One of them was this fucking gorilla, a real big cunt, the other he was like... The cocksucker had this weird barnet. All curly, like it was permed. Uh-huh... Was he tall? Oh, yeah. Well, sort of average. Fuck it, I went down and everything, I never really looked at them. I didn't have a tape measure. We'll talk later. Been sleeping? I think so... You're joking, aren't you? Beer's the only thing for a hangover. I drink that, we can go straight back to hospital. There's a McDonald's on the corner. - I'm a bit strapped right now. - Really? They say you're driving about in a jeep. I also heard you'd bought a speedboat. Says Little Miss Top-of-the-Class who never goes around getting arseholed! Everything's so fucking screwed up. Just for once, I agree. Remember that Christmas we went to the mountains? In that log cabin? It snowed non-stop. What made you think of that? Just... back then everything was still real good. If you say so. We built that snowman modelled on Dad. He went ape when he saw its hair! That was when he started combing it over, remember? It put the shits up me when them wild boar came! Oh, yeah. I'd forgotten all about that. They sat there grunting under the window. Good job Uncle Endre was there to chase them off. - Uh-huh. With the broom. - With the broom. That was brutal. Good afternoon. Attila Miklósi? - That's me. - Special delivery. Here you are. Sign here, please. Legibly. - Thank you! Have a nice day. - Goodbye! The number you have called is not available. Please try again later. - Yes? - Good afternoon, I'm Attila Miklósi. Is Imre home? Come in. Thank you. The funeral's next Tuesday. And... How exactly did it happen? It was so stupid, he fell awkwardly, he swallowed his tongue. - I've got all your things ready. - Oh, that's not why... Here are the ski suits, I've washed them. And the kids' helmets... I'm afraid this broke... I don't know if it can be fixed. It doesn't matter. - I'll pay for it. - It's really not important. Oh, I almost forgot. Imre bought this for you. To say thank you. Poor little Mira's so sleepy. Puke in her hair, feeling weepy. - All the kids sitting in detox... - Don't put that in! Don't censor me, child! - Make it something nice! Please! - Only if you go to sleep! Rock-a-bye, rock-a-bye, baby. Márky G'll watch over your dreams. Feel your eyelids growing heavy. Go to sleep, Mira, for Christ's sake. That was awful! But don't stop. What's up? Nothing. But I gotta go now. Can't you put it off? No. What's happened? I've screwed something up. Really fucking badly. Want to talk about it? It's better if you don't know. I dunno what's going to happen, but if I get out in one piece, then... You'll release an album of lullabies? Yeah. That'd be fucking tops. Hello! What's up? Backache? No. I'm fine. - What's this? - Goat's cheese. From Switzerland. Give me 20,000, would you? I need a facial. A manicure wouldn't hurt either. We've got no money, Janka. Get out of it! - You pulled off that job, didn't you? - That job? - Yeah. I pulled it off. - So when will they pay you? And Tibi? Tibi? Tibi's a fuckwit. Maybe, but what do I tell my beautician? - We've lost the money. - What do you mean, lost it? The safe's empty. I might as well have flushed it all down the pan. The walls were made of paper. Tibi fucked everyone over. We're flat broke, Janka. In fact we're in the red. Strasszer's dead. They tumbled us. Amount outstanding: 81,474,549 HUF But it's alright. If we haven't got anything, they can't take anything away from us. You've lost the plot! It's tough right now, Janka, but this is how we started out 20 years ago. Now's the chance to start anew. Yeah. You're right. You? What are you doing here? I haven't got much time now, I'm leaving in a minute. What's this? Bloody fucking shit! Don't be mad at me! I'm so sorry! I bet you are. It's all here? No. There's a bit missing. Alright... I was young once, I fucked up, too. I'm so sorry. I'll make it up to you. You'll work for what you spent. But right now I think it'd be best if you just fucked off out of here. What? There's something else. Hello! - What are you doing here? - I tried to call you. I was switched off. Go on through. I won't be a minute. Make yourself at home. - May I? - Please. Sorry for bursting in on you. You're not the easiest woman to figure out. We have a good time, but then you'd still rather go home. You don't take my calls for days, then when you do, you're with your husband. You say you're busy, then pop over unannounced. In other words, you'd like to know what it is I want from you. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you're here. I really like your company. But I'm too tired for playing games. And too old. Why the window-dressing? You're an old fart! I appreciate your frankness. Sorry. So... I'm living together with my husband, but it's not been the same as it was for a long time now. I never did have many boyfriends. Teenage sweethearts, that's what we... were. He's a good man, but... We've grown so distant from each other. I know what it's like. But even if something's bad, you can cling to it until something or... someone wakes you up to the fact that life's too short to waste on bad things. So you came here. So I came here. It's beautiful! Yes, it is. You shouldn't be here. All the way here, I was hoping you wouldn't be. It'd have been better all round. Márk's told me a story. And I don't want to believe it. If you weren't here, I wouldn't. But, like this... Endre, I know how this must look. But I'm not dumb. You and me go way back. I am sick and fucking tired of both of you. Listen, I knew he was sus, I just didn't have proof. I didn't wanna accuse him cos he's your godson. I told him to bring half of the cash so he couldn't bullshit you that I'd swiped it. Hey! Godson! Time you learned a lesson! So it'll never cross your mind to try fucking me over ever again! Come on, then! His feet are yours!
