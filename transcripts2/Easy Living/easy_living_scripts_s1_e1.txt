 - What a dog! - Shh! What? - Good morning. Does Tóni Sallai still work here? - Yes. Thank you! - Morning all! - Good morning! Purple scum! Újpest? Who are ya? I don't believe it, Attila! - I haven't seen you in bloody ages! - How do, Uncle Tóni? The missus gnaws me to the bone. I feel as weak as a kitten! - Don't even see you at the match. - Ah! I don't go... What for? You're right, it's not worth it... Buying nig-nogs, that's where it started! It was '81 we were last champs with a pure side! Since then it's just Serbs and coons. Can't they find 11 able-bodied Hungarian lads? There's no Ebedlis or Nyilasis nowadays. Now it was worth watching them play. Uncle Tóni, I need a nice little Merc. The newer, the better. White or grey metallic... For the wife. What's your budget? Less than a year old. In for its first service. They're picking it up this afternoon. Hmm? Nice. Not got a white one? MOTHER & DAUGHTER BEAUTY CONTEST Hello? Good morning! I've brought some leaflets. - Atti... - Mum, I'll call back in five minutes. No! The hospital's just rang, he's ever so bad. - Hurry! - Okay, calm down. I'll go straight over. Hello, Dad! Tibi, is that you? No. It's me, Atti. Who are you? It's me, Dad! Attila. Your son. No. You're no son of mine! Dad... - Get off me! - Dad... Don't you touch me! You won't tarnish me! - Father... - You had the nerve to come here like this? - You should be ashamed! - Dad, Dad... Bugger off! You've shamed us... the whole family... blackened... my name... bugger off... Get my bag, please... Pull over and stop the car! I said pull over! What now? What did I do wrong? - Not slowing down before that zebra crossing. ! No one was there! - You should have made sure. - I looked around! - Can you drop me at Blaha Square? - No problem. Are you serious? Why'd you do such a fool thing? It's Janka's birthday on Friday. She's always had expensive tastes... But she'll be happy now. So it's time to treat yourself to a little earner! I've bought a full lorry. You pick it up on Friday. Make a nice little surprise. I can't do it. My dad's died. - You can still drive, can't you? - Send someone else! I can't send just anyone. What's up with you, Atti? Your dad was a cunt. He hardly had a kind word for you all his days! What's up? Don't need the cash? Don't tell me Janka's wish list is empty! Sorry. I can't manage it right now. - I'll get the car parked up. - What for? - Just until its new papers are ready. - New papers? Where from? I don't need that shitheap here! The 90s are over, Atti! Reg. cards, engine numbers, data checks... You want to hope it's not got a GPS tracking system! You used to be able to look after all that... Sorry. I can't manage it right now. How much you want? It's only done 15k, practically new... Four million. For spare parts? Okay, three and a half. One. One million? Okay, alright. I'll give you a part exchange. Four hundred newton metres' torque in ya face. Three tonnes scrunch ya head, you fucking waste of space! Goddam steroids shrink my dick, it's a bummer. Doctor man he said, You need a solid-chrome Hummer! Hundred-ten valves, fifty cylinders, I'm able. My mind starts pumping iron, muscles like steel cables. Gimme a protein shake, watch me grow big. Stand back, mothafucka, gonna flatten me some pigs... - Oy, you little prick! Off! - Sorry, we were just finishing... - If you've scratched it, you're dead! - Rubber soles! Now get to fuck! Listen, just let us finish! I can pay... 100k! Okay, ciao! Ciao! You said it was all sorted! - A bit of pruning? Hello! - Good day! - Ah! You mustn't prune medlars! - Why's that? - The fruit buds are at the top. - Oh, I see... - So, tomorrow at 3:00? - Yes, yes... Judit will be a bit late, but, yes, come at 3:00. Alright. I'm really looking forward to it! It's so good to finally be doing something useful... - Thank you again! - Oh, not at all. You know, the commerce gala at the Concert Hall's soon. We'll need to make a token pledge, but it'll be worth it. Everyone important will be there. - And what's in it for us? - Networking opportunities. I'm sure I'll be able to persuade some CEO to support us. - You've got a nice place. - Yes... That's an Astrea sofa! Ten million would get the warming centre in Király Street finished. A mother and daughter beauty contest! What kind of woman would put her child through such a thing? I'll put it before the committee tomorrow. - Will you back me up? - Of course. It's a very interesting idea... Oh, that'll be Attila with my new car! A B-class Mercedes! - Good afternoon. - Congratulations on your new car! The first one Ambrus and I had was a Skoda, too. Were we pleased! It was in the 70s... we'd had to wait three years for it. Give us a proper knife! How could you humiliate me like that? I'd told them about the Mercedes! I'm sorry. Hollós let me down. I didn't ask Endre for a car. I asked you! Cut some for me! - This is shit. - Same as usual, then. - Why can't you learn to cook? - Who from? Mum? - Got your licence? - They failed me. - Again? - I did great! Sure. I guess that's why they failed you. Robi said this'd happen. If I don't slip the wanker 30k, I'll fail a fifth time, too! Others can pass without doing that. Will you give me 30k? Dad... - Shouldn't you practise a bit more? - Oh, shut up! Why don't you give him it? You begrudge a measly 30,000 to get them off his back? Grandpa's died. You know, I wanted to go and see him today... but then... I thought I could go tomorrow. Now there is no tomorrow. Did you go in? Good! At least you were there by his side. Was he conscious? Could you talk? Did you patch things up? Yeah. That's good. He died ashamed of me. Then he was an idiot! It was a different world. That's right: a different world. They had no choice. But we do. - Hello, Endre! - Hello, gorgeous! Give us a kiss... Many happy returns! It's beautiful! What are you having? I've already told you, I can't do it. - Bye! - When will you be back? After band practice. I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important, Atti! All you've got to do is drive to the services and back. - I don't believe this! Are you getting old? - I must be. Don't leave me in the shit, mate! I'll double the cash! - How much? - What? The prison sentence? One million. For a little round trip. Are you serious, Attila? You heard. All you've got to do is drive! We're burying Dad the next day. Well this'll take your mind off it. And we could use the money... What time's kick-off? Friday at 4:00, down the depot. Kick-ass ride! Next time you borrow it, let me know first! Give us a lift into town? Go on... Time you helped the poor thing change gear. - I like to drag it out. - You drag on your prick, son! First car I ever drove was your grandpa's Moskvitch. He did his nut when he found out. Your dad wasn't allowed anywhere near it. But Tibi, he got his own Lada 1500 straight away. Got any jobs going? I need the dough for my test. - What kind of job? - Anything. I can drive just as well as Dad! - Only I don't shit myself. - No, you're like Janka, aren't you? Gulyás, Csér, Szabadkai... if we can win just one of them over... So you are asking the committee for 70,000 forints so you can go gallivanting at the Concert Hall? I'm not going gallivanting, Judit! - No, she'll be networking. - I see. Right! In the foundation's name. It's how things work! But getting tarted up to go schmoozing, is that really our style? Wouldn't a well-worded circular be more effective? Are we really nitpicking over a lousy 70,000? Janka! Right now every penny is spoken for. 70,000 might not be much, but we can't just fritter it away. It'd be enough to repaint all the rooms in the shelter. Klári, you said before that... Alright, we mustn't get bogged down. Let's vote, shall we? Who votes that we pay for Janka to go to the Concert Hall? Hi. Would you sign this? It's to get selective waste collection here in the school. Hi! We need to separate the rubbish, sign... Hi, would you sign, please? Selective waste collection in school. It's a really important... issue... Okay, whatever. - Hi, won't you sign this? - You're joking! Hot outfit, Mira baby! What was it, your first communion? - Chill out, we voted for you! - Which one would you screw, Tomi? - The MILF for sure. And you? - I'd take the dog. Ignore them! Stupid idiots! They're just jealous. They've got it in for anyone who's better than them. I think you're really pretty on that photo. Why don't you always wear your hair like that? Cos it sucks! It was my gran's birthday, I had to let it down. Who cares? I think it suits you. How could she? She didn't even ask, she just went and sent it in! Tell me about it. My mum's always buying me these checked shirts. I never wear them, but she won't give up. Is the dog yours? Uh-huh. - Cute, isn't he? - Yeah. - Do you like dogs? - I love them. - And you? - Me, too. - Half board? - Any self-catering packages? Full board. There's a special offer here. Hotel Annabel, 4-star. We'd rather have five. Like this one... Hotel L'Ours Blanc. - How many persons? - Four. - Four? - We're taking the kids, too. So, you two gentlemen... and two children. I'll need your passport as well, sir. No, I'm going with my wife. By the way... Is the ski pass included? No, that's an extra 240 euros per person. Let's include it, please! You've just been to Tunisia... That was in summer. Where will you want to go next? Thailand? Don't worry, I haven't got that much leave. Thanks for lunch. - We're going skiing? - Not us. Strasszer. - You've bought him another holiday? - What other choice have I got? - Tell him to drop dead, for instance! - Yeah, right. And then instead of 30,000 a month, the bank'd want 600,000. We're still better off like this. The French Alps... On our money... Unbelievable! - That no-mark! - It's the no-marks that can be bought. - Why do we never go skiing? - Cos we've not got a spare half-mil. You'll be earning twice that on Friday. - And the safe's bursting. - That's not for holidays. Then what is it for? Janka, what if one day I get caught? Ever thought about that? What about you three? How'd you get by while I was doing time? Let me worry about that! I've worked enough! Since I was 15... Listen, we've been living like this for 20 years... I'm getting tired... Sooner or later I'll slip up... You never used to be like this! That's what I loved about you. - We didn't crap out, we went for it. - Uh-huh. That's why we owe tens of millions. And there's that bank loan. My dad raised me to be an honest man. - Have you bought something for Mum? - What with? - Your pocket money! - I blew it all on my bus pass. When I was your age, I never even got that much. - It's straight home after school! - I've got band practice. And I've got a date. Not today, you haven't! It's your mother's birthday! Who's your date with? Hmm? - A classmate. You don't know him. - What's his name? Áron Trencsényi. Wasn't his father the ambassador in Lisbon? - How should I know? - Well ask him! - They've a solicitor's office now. - Whoopee! - What's up with you? - What do you think? Still on about that stupid photo? You can't just go uploading photos of me, Mum! Especially without even asking me first! Lucky you didn't send a nudie of me in the sandpit! You ought to be grateful. Someone's finally asked you out! You can call this Áron and tell him you're busy! Up your arse. We agreed we'd be together for your mother's birthday! Leave it! Let them go! I don't want to sit staring at their sour faces. Ambrus! Oh, God! Ambrus! Look here! It must have been the storm... It was wild out last night... And the other trees? They're alright! Maybe it was rabbits. They plague us, too. Rabbits, I bet! They cut through this mesh, did they? Hello, Buda Properties. István Csapó speaking... The one in Pasaréti Square? Yes, yes... Is ten o'clock alright? Three months' deposit... That's a little unusual. Yes, I've tried to reason with the owner, but he insists on it. He's had problems before. The bathroom... and at the end, the bedroom. We'll think about it, alright? We'll call you in a couple of days. Well, I am expecting one or two more people... A Dutch gentleman is due at 3:00... It really is an exceptional price for a place like this. - Then can we talk it over now? - Go right ahead! Am I glad you're here! They called you? The flat below is flooded out, it's probably the mains, we shut the water off and we had to open up the wall... - Who are you? - The caretaker. How d'you do? We haven't met yet, Tivadar Puskás. We had to get in here to stop it getting any worse... I don't understand. Nobody informed me! The plumber's here already. Naturally the insurance will cover everything... In the bathroom! He must be the Dutchman. Stop! Hey! Do you hear? Stop! Call the police! Shit... Fuck... Fuck's going on? Where are you? Are you there? - I can't make it. - You what? - Are you taking the piss? - No... - Fuck it, Attila... - I'm done with it. I'm through. Fucking hell! Alright? You busy? The one before that was fine. I can manage, alright? Bye, Mum! I'd go for the little black one. No way! It's dead slutty! Hold out your hand! We'll show that lad what kind of family you're from! Here he is! It's a policeman. - Good evening! - Good evening! Is Attila Miklósi here? - He's not home. - When will he be back? I'm not sure... He's away on business. What is it about? Your neighbour... Ambrus Tóth... has reported an act of vandalism in his garden last night. Oh yes, their little date tree. Poor Klári! - Medlar. - Oh, that's right! - How do you get on with the Tóths? - Ever so well! I was over there for a meeting only yesterday. We run a homeless aid foundation together. You didn't notice anything strange last night? No. Do you have any idea who might have done it? Well... I don't want to cast aspersions, but those Salamon twins, little devils they are... It's not certain... I don't want to get anybody into trouble! Of course not. Well, thank you. Sorry to have disturbed you! - Goodnight! - Goodnight! Mira! - Hi! - Hi! - Dead on time! Wanna come in? - Sure. Just a minute. Take a look around. Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Here, Rocky! - Making friends, Chooker? - His name's Rocky! - What? What are you doing? - Come on, Rocky, let's go home! - You can't take him! - He was stolen from our garden last May! - Dad got him from the dogs' home! - Our address was on his collar. - No way! - You're lucky I don't report you! Stick to 50! Don't get us stopped. I just get in the truck and we turn back. Stay a few hundred metres ahead of me, you see the filth, you call me. Got it? Stop shitting yourself, you're a minor, you'd get six months tops! - We know them? Wanna stop? - Step on it. What is it? What's happened? I hate you! I hate you! Okay, cool it, slow down! Slow down, you hear? You hear? What are you doing? It's over. I've had enough. From now on we're cleaning up our act.
