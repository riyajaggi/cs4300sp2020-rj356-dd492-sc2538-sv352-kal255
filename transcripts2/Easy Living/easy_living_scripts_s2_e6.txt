 Previously... I take no pleasure in your being sent to a place like this. Hollós is a tough nut. What have you got on him? There’s this place where he hides stuff. Guns. It wasn’t you who was the real shit. It was Endre who dragged you away from the car. - We can’t just leave them! - He was doing a ton! It was his fault! His life’s not been easy. So he’s the right to screw up everyone else’s, too? I’m grateful for the work you’ve done, Nándor. Alright, boys, this is your show.

 - Márk’s been shot. - Jesus Christ! You are under arrest for illegal possession of firearms and willing participation in acts of terrorism. Editor Cinematographer Producers Writers Director GOLDEN LIFE Before You Can Score, You’ve Got To Know The Score It’s a good thing you called me. This was Jeanie’s fourth calving, wasn’t it? I’ll give her some antibiotics. Tomorrow she needs anti-inflammatories. Zsolti! I need you. Right away.

 - Jeanie’s calf’s got E. coli. - And bring your bag. Good evening! He’s been shot? Christ, Feri... - You know I can’t... - Help us, doctor. Please! Fucking hell! I’m having nothing to do with this! You’re the only one who can help me. - Feri, don’t do this to me! - I know I’m asking a lot of you. I wouldn’t do it if I had any other choice. I helped you out when you needed it. Now I’m asking you for a favour. That was different: a loan. And I’ve told you before, I’ll pay you back. But this, it’d be a criminal offence! Attila and me go way back. Márk’s his lad. I shouldn’t have let him have a go with my hunting rifle. It’s my responsibility. I can understand that, Feri. But I’m not... I can’t do it. If it ever got out, I’d be... Just let me leave. Please! - Help us, doctor! My son... - Leave it! - We can’t let him go! Márk’s gonna... - Patience! He knows that if he drives away now, he can never come back. He’d lose a lot of business, though he’d get by. But then word would get out he wasn’t working for me anymore. And then everyone for miles around would be calling my new vet, not him. He’d have to take his daughter out of her private nursery school. Pretty soon, he’d start falling behind on his mortgage. Everything we do is for the family. He’s looking out for his own right now. - Did the bullet come out? - No. - Dad! - I’m here, son. I need a big basin of boiling water. It’s okay. Don’t move! Don’t move! Everything’ll be alright! - So, your lover... - He’s not my lover! - Your partner... - My fiancé! - ...arrived home at 10 p.m. - Quarter past 9! Want it all a fourth time? I can’t say anything new! Can’t you get it? It’s alright, they’ll be gone soon, sweetie. You just go on up to your room. And you: for God’s sake, get off our backs! I’ve been nice. I’ve cooperated. But this is police harassment. You can talk to Dr Szendrák, he’s our lawyer. What the bloody hell now? Right! Make sure you put this in your report! How much longer do you want to trash my house for? This wasn’t what we agreed. Did you say something? I saw you lot planting that bag of guns. Hollós is banged up. That’s what you want, too, isn’t it? Yeah. But not for this. For what he’s really done! We agreed, didn’t we? You knew it’d be like this. So don’t go playing the innocent now. Do we understand each other? Yeah, only it’d have been better if... You listen here! My daughter’s still a minor. She can only be questioned with a parent present! Got it? - Go to your room. - Okay. - And don’t talk to anyone. - Okay. Let him rest for a few days. I’ll look in again on Sunday. - And keep the wound clean. - Zsolt... Thank you. I’ll be eternally grateful for this, you know that. It’d be best if no one else saw this. - Sure he’ll not tell anyone? - Sure. But I’ll have him followed for a bit, all the same. Who’s he? - Is he hurt? - Go back to your room. - What’s up with him? - Bianka! I’ll not tell you again! - Shit... - For fuck’s fucking sake! Alright, alright. God... Will the Socialists be returned to power in the 1998 general election, or will the tactics of the alliance led by the Young Democrats pay off? Atti! The postman was here... How many times have I said? We don’t accept recorded delivery! I’m sorry! When I heard the knock, I thought it was Ági. I know I should’ve peeped out first. What’s it say? If we don’t want to renege on the loan agreement, we’ve got to give them the late instalments in a lump sum. I sweat my guts out in 2 jobs, we pay what we can. What more do they fucking want? Filthy fucker: puking all over the seats, but a tip...? I said: if you let me fix your meter, you’ll be earning your tips in advance. And if I pick up an inspector? I can kiss my arse goodbye. You know what they say, Atti: “Before you can score, you’ve got to know the score.” Wanna be an honest cabbie? You’ll be a world-first! And him? Where’s he get that stuff? 970, please. But for 5000, I could throw in a bottle of Give-en-chee for the wife. Keep 30 for yourself. And some perfume? Colobembe Roodge! Thank you! Hosts France won the football World Cup for the first time... Thank you! Don’t want some perfume for your lady? Chan-nel? Give-en-chee? - How much you got? - How much do you need? I’ll take the lot! Come on, man! What’s up? Leave it out. It’s not mine! - Morning! - You’re done early! How long’s he been awake? Since 2:00. - Christ! What’s happened to your face? - Nothing. I’ve had a shit night. Wake me up at 7:50, will you? Thanks. They’ve launched a manhunt. National Security say they don’t know any names yet, but they’ve got a pretty clear CCTV still of Márk. Feri, I... I tell you, mate, there really isn’t much to say. They’ve nabbed Hollós. He’s in custody. Get your shit together, we’re going in to see him. Feri... I’d not be that happy to leave Márk here. Wasn’t I happy to help you last night? Happy to blackmail Zsolti, happy to compromise myself? You’d do better to show a bit of gratitude, Attila! We’ll look the bastard in the eye one last time. And then we’ll leave him there to rot. Attila! - Where is he? - In there. I’m taking him home! Get real! He mustn’t be moved! He’s got to rest! And every copper in the country’s out looking for us! Why’d you bring him here? He should be in hospital! Janka! Our son shot someone in the head. I saw it with my own eyes. Are we such rotten parents? A year ago, everything was fine. We had money, the kids were in school... We were perfectly happy. - The hell we were happy! - You weren’t happy! Fuck knows when I was last happy. How’s Mira? I think she’s done something silly. They took Endre away last night. Cos of that shoot-out. They found a load of guns in the garden. I reckon the cops put them there. - And Mira helped them. - Fucking hell! - If Endre’s released and he finds out... - He’ll not be released. He’s been inside loads of times. And he’s always got out again! - Where can’t they extradite you from? - I’ll check. I can sort us new passports. But I’ll need some cash. I’ll get some. We can scram to South America or somewhere. We can start all over... No, Attila! We’re not starting anything again! I’ve fucking had enough of you. You and Endre! As soon as the kids are safe, you’ll go your way and we’ll go ours. Mum! You might once call me back. The police have gone, but the house is still a right tip. Call me, will you? - What do you want? - There’s a bit of a problem. We’ve got to meet. - The neighbours have got... - Tomorrow. Outside the school. Hi! Feeling better? Whoops... Shit happens. You’ll have to get into the chair. Need a hand? Thanks! You know, you’re lucky you got off so lightly. 14 stiffs: that’s some body count! You guys are on every channel. Okay, I’ll have them bring a new one. I’ll get you some clean pants! Halt! Turn to the wall! Hands out! Wanna earn yourself a heap of money? - Pali! Would you? - Who is it? Up you go! Take your book! - Hello? - How-do, Pali-Wally? You’ve got to help me. You’re in such deep shit, I can smell it from here. Even God himself couldn’t help you now. But you could. Unless you want that Ambrosia shit to hit the fan. - Those papers will get out... - Go fuck yourself, Endre. Son of a fucking bitch! I need the company’s papers for the contract! Endre wants to sell his trucks? Endre’s in custody. He can’t arrange things like this right now! Look... We need some ready cash double quick, and all the accounts have been frozen, you know that yourself. Endre’s going to need a good lawyer. The best I can find. Then we’ll have to get to the judges, and that’ll cost a pretty penny, too. I’ve no idea about the legal part, that’s your side. But you’ve got to help! And when this whole nightmare’s over, you’ll not find us ungrateful. As soon as I receive written authorization from Endre that you may act on his behalf, I’ll be at your disposal. Atti! Alright, Enosz? Feri Gáll? Fuck. You bet: fuck. Feri Gáll! Alright, mate? You’ve grown old. You look a bit creaky yourself. Yeah, this leg of mine’s certainly not what it was. Ever since you two left me to burn alive in that BMW. Listen, Feri... I’m sorry. It really was the pits, but... We were 20 years old, fuck it all, proper little dickheads. Endre! Let’s forget the fucking past! It can’t be helped now, can it? You got me put here? Those guns... Was that you? Did you know, Atti? So this is your revenge? For us running out on you in Holland? You... Have you really wasted 25 fucking years of your life on this? Why didn’t you come to me? Why couldn’t we have talked? What about? About why you left me there? About how I had to tear my own leg off to get out of the burning car? Fuck it... I don’t believe this! Why did you split? I’ve never been able to figure it out. I’ve played it back a thousand times. Mari was still alive... You could’ve pulled her out in time. You ran away when you had nothing to worry about! You deserted me! I was trapped there just listening to her screams! Feri... I’m sorry. I really am sorry. Me, too! And now centuries later, you stitch me up and get me sent down? You’ve done enough to get sent down. And Atti? He gets away with it? Attila’s proved himself. Smashing. And can I prove myself, too? I’ve been watching you both. For years. Whatever you did, I was there. Every little caper. I saw how you used Attila. And I was forced to realize that he was just one of your victims, too. You poison everyone. Okay then, Long John Silver! Just watch out you don’t slip up, cos if I ever get out of here, I’ll ram that peg leg up your fucking arse! Tomcsa never got out. You’ve disappointed me big time, Atti! I’m real sorry Janka and Márk chose me, but teaming up with this...? I told you never to go anywhere near my son again! But you didn’t give a shit, and he almost ended up getting killed! And you’ve done it twice. You’re just scum! Okay, Atti... We’ll soon see whether the lapdog’s found himself a better owner. My old man couldn’t stand the sight of me. His golden boy causes a fatal accident while he’s out of his box... He packed me off to Oxford. Then I tanned my ass in Goa for 2 years. All I wanted to do was forget everything. But then Dad got put in the Ministry of Finance. He needed someone to take over his firms. I came home. Everything was put into my sister’s name so I could avoid the limelight. But it was me who was in charge of everything. So that’s why we never knew about you... The big orders kept coming in: motorways, metro line 4... And then when we were getting one of the firms liquidated, I noticed that among its suppliers was Ultrasped. Contract signatory: Endre Hollós. Everything came flooding back. In 2009, we lost Dad after a stroke. And from then on, I knew I had to put an end to the whole shitty business. You said you just wanted to look him in the eye. I changed my mind. Don’t worry, Attila. It’ll all be over soon. Undersecretary resigns Confesses to billion-forint tax fraud MOT Bay Ultrasped Ltd - Hello! - Hello! Come on over, dude! Or you’re in for a shagging! I’m telling you, you’re in for a shagging if you don’t come! So, Mr Stork finally showed! - He looks the spit of you. - I reckon he’s like his dad. Nah. He’s too good-looking. Listen, I want to ask you for something. Anything for you! Oh, Jesus fucking Christ! Soz, mate! Have you spoken to Márk? He’s in a right state, but he’ll survive. - Feri Gáll helped him. - What? Attila took him over. At least he’ll be safe there. - You’ve got to get him out of there! - No way will I! No one’ll look for him there. Feri’s like the Lord God himself. I’ve talked to Benjámin Vogel, he’s the best there is in criminal law. But his fees are astronomical. So... Have we got any cash tucked away anywhere? Alright, no problem. I’ve found a buyer for a few of Ultrasped’s lorries. - All I need’s an authorization... - It’s too late, Janka. Of course it’s not! I can sort it all out. They’ve raised the deposit, I just need to sign the contract. - Send me an authorization. Today! - It’s too late, love! What’s going on? Listen, Janka... Maybe... So... Listen, all I wanted to say to you was... All in all, I’ve not had a bad life. Everything worked out for me. Except for one thing. Or I guess it did, only too late. I guess... I mean... I was only ever happy when I was with you. You were... You are the best thing in my life. And if I’d known that the two of us... ...that someday you’d be mine, I’d never ever have risked so much! But what’s happened? I always was shit at games. I never knew how to lose. And now... - I really am stuck behind the fucking 8-ball. - Tell me what’s happened! Feri Gáll wants to off me. Here inside. I guess you’ll get a phone call saying I’ve topped myself. Endre! They can’t do this to you! Endre, look at me! Goodbye, Janka. - Márk? - A bit better. His temperature’s down. He’s eaten, too. He’s sleeping now. Endre’s worried he might... have some kind of accident in prison. Do you think there’s any chance of it? Yeah. When? I dunno. Soon. Attila... I can only get money out of him while he’s still alive. You got that? I need time. - You’ve got to hold Feri up! - And how am I meant to do that? How should I know? Think of something! Make an effort for once in your life. Think of the kids! Endre’s got to live! For another day, at least. I need time to come up with something. We’ve only been together a month, but if we drew up a contract... A contract of property rights doesn’t override inheritance laws. If there’s no will, only the spouse can inherit. Then I’ll marry him! - You’ll have to get a divorce first. - Then get me one. - But while he’s still in custody... - We’ll backdate it. I’ll do without the ceremony, all I want’s the certificate. Alright. We’ll need to find some hayseed notary who’s not had any marriages in the last week. I need it today. - On top of the notary, there’ll be the registrar... - How much? 3 million. Cash. Right away. It’s worth more than 10. It’ll cover the divorce, too. What’s up? Going away? Yeah, and so are you. And Márk and your father, too. - Dad...? But where are we going? - Thailand. Get packing! Are you for real, Mum? We’re going on holiday? Now? Like hell are we going on holiday, girl. We’re emigrating. And we’ll be praying that no one’ll find us there. You’re nuts. - I’m not going anywhere with you. - You really put your foot in it. - You don’t know what kind of shit you’ve been stirring! - You what? The people who got you to help put Endre inside: now they want him dead! What’s up? This is what you wanted, isn’t it? What’s all this fuss about the neighbours? - Someone wants to kill Hollós! - Who told you that? Is it true? - This wasn’t what we agreed! - We agreed that he’d be punished. - But how can they just mur... - You listen here! You don’t say a word about this to anyone. And you’re gonna forgot that you and me ever met. Understand? Or else? Or else you’ll take a bath. Like your Gypsy girlfriend did. Mr Prosecutor! Miss Miklósi? We cannot speak outside the courtroom. I’ll see you next week. This isn’t about my case. - What’s this? - A video. Of guns being sneaked into Endre Hollós’s garden. The city-centre shootings aren’t mine. DCI Erika Jakab had her officers sneak the supposed evidence into Hollós’s garden. I can’t go to the police. Who knows how many of them are in on it? I understand if you don’t believe me. But... just watch it. Here’s my number. If you don’t call by tonight, I’ll find someone else to give it to. How do you like it? It’s good. I shot it last spring. Atti! What are you doing here? Sorry we started the venison without you, but... Janka was expecting. I panicked: if they nabbed us, I’d never get to see my baby. It was me. Not Endre. It was me who said we should leave you. What are you on about, Dad? I’ve got no excuse. I’m sorry. I’ve regretted it a million times. You are only saying this to save Hollós, right? What’s with Uncle Endre? Dad! What’s with Uncle Endre? Fuck it, Atti! Why did you do it? I wanted to tell you a thousand times, but I never could. I’d started to trust you. I’d forgiven you. What do you expect of me? You screwed me for a year, my life’s in ruins. - Right! And that’s down to me! - No, it’s down to me. Hollós is right. I always needed to follow someone. - I was a fucking puppet. - So? Is that your excuse? Everyone’s a puppet! Everyone’s got someone above them! - No one’s higher than God! - Stop fucking bullshitting! You think you are God. It’s all a game to you. And your daughter, your toadies: they’re just the pawns you play with. And what for? Okay, what happened to you was tragic. I can’t begin to imagine it. But it was 25 years ago, for fuck’s sake! 24 years, 2 months, and 13 days. And, no, you really can’t imagine what I went through! Like that justifies anything? My life got fucked up: someone’s got pay for it! You stupid fucking prick! What fucked it up was sitting plotting like some kid instead of trying to live! You’ve got power, you’ve got money. You’re free! What more do you want? Piss off, I’m not fighting with you! Cut it out! I said cut it out! Feri! Don’t! Dad! We’re off now. And you’re gonna forget us. No more threats. And leave Endre alone, too! You really think that’s it? You’ll get your comeuppance. I’ll do the both of you in! What is this shit, Dad? Where do you think you can hide? Dad! - Dad! - Hollós has had it. And we have, too, - if we don’t scram quick. - What do you mean, “had it”? - Tell me what the fuck’s going on! - You’ll get nowhere in that! They’ve both got chips, they’d cut out before the gate. You’d not be let through anyway. Pops’ll already be punching the panic button. - Then how do we get out of here? - Follow me! - Tell me, Dad... - You coming? They’ll be here in 2 minutes. If we come through, I will, but just cut the yap now! Bianka! Get the dogs! I bought it on the sly last year. I knew I was gonna split one of these days. I just hope the battery’s not flat! Well, Miss Miklósi, you have certainly made some waves. - Why? What’s happened? - Only what always happens in Hungary. All you can see on the video are the 2 constables. But it was on DCI Jakab’s orders that... Neither is willing to implicate anyone else, they’re accepting all the blame. - And if I testify against her? - Either those officers have been intimidated, or their families have received a whole lot of money. Maybe both. We are in very deep and murky waters, Miss Miklósi. So what now? I don’t know. The judge has the recording, the charges against Hollós will be dropped. I’m not sure... I’ll have to think the next step through with a clear head tomorrow. Have you got anywhere to go? - Why? - It wouldn’t be too difficult for DCI Jakab and whoever she’s working for to figure out who informed on them. But... Where can I go? What else can you get me? What’s selling right now? CD players, CDs. Videotapes. Bring some of each. I knew that goody-two-shoes crap was just a front. You’re sharp enough, you. Hey, Bogdán! Fix my meter, too! - 80 grand. - In one night? Get used to it. I’ve made up my mind. Enough’s enough! No more bank instalments. No more taxes. It’s what the cunts wanted! We’ll not even punch our tickets on the tram. I wish you every happiness! Extract from the Register of Marriages Halt!
