 - Can't Tibi do it? - I'm studying! Tibi's studying! Attila! Take it out, for God's sake! Lettuce for only 1 forint! In May! But no one will buy them. They say they're radioactive! Their stupid brains are radioactive! There wasn't any explosion over there. Well, something's not right. 1 forint! And at the market hall, too! They're just stirring things up. If a reactor had exploded, don't you think Moscow would have told us? The army would know about it! What the..? Alright? What's up? If my dad finds out, he'll kill you! Well, what if he doesn't find out?

 Okay, listen here. I'll leave enough in so's the old Commie can get as far as the barracks. The rest's mine. And tomorrow you get 100 forints. What do you say? Attila! Shut that bloody mosquito screen! Coming! 120! Endre Hollós. Call me Enosz. - Miklósi. - I know who you are. Tomorrow at the basketball court. Make the victim comfortable then staunch the bleeding. Disinfect the wound and bandage it tightly... - Looks like the bullet's out. - Massive! - But he's bleeding badly! - It hurts like fuck! First aid: bleeding It says to watch out for internal bleeding... - Okay, we'll watch out! - Indications: dizziness, nausea, increase or decrease in heart rate... - Endre, this needs a doctor! - You don't say! We've got to stop the bleeding! Get a first aid kit! - Where from? - Here... Move it! Hungary's business barons Looking for someone? No. Oszi! - Thank you! - You can keep them! - Are you crazy? These must've cost a bomb! - So? You saw, she's got plenty more! She couldn't even take them all with her. Well, thanks! I'll get her something nice from my first pay packet in Basle. Right! Listen, Oszi. I've been thinking things over. I've found a better solution. Look, honey, you're dead sweet and all, but it's too... I'm going. End of. Péter's sorted everything. By Monday, I'll even have got my permit. Don't look at me like that! I talked to Regina's cousin, she's got a friend who was out there. The place is dead normal! One day off a week. They have medical check-ups... - It's not that bad at all. - It is. It's shit. Getting 4 or 5 hundred francs for one weekend can't be that shit. - Know how much I'd get for 3 months? - No idea. It's still not worth it. It's fucking loads of money! Listen, let's start with something less ambitious, okay? We could apply to be sales assistants at Balabo. It's this boutique downtown. We'd get about 120,000 net a month each. We can rent a little flat, it'll be great. Take your head out of the clouds, okay? First off, they'd never take me on. Don't get me wrong, but it's easy for you. With me, wherever I go suddenly all the jobs vanish into thin air. - And if someone pulls some strings for us? ! Who? Who's that? I've seen him before! Isn't he that chef off the TV? How to fix gauze balls between swabs with bandages or fabric strips. - Slowly, you hear? - There's a how-to video, too! - Don't get it in the wound! - Okay. - Fuck! - Keep quiet! Don't move... - It says it's good if he talks. - I'll be fucked! You're awesome, Dad! Yeah! Except there's a dead copper lying here outside my warehouse! If you'd only trusted me... Not on me! Shine it on the wound! So much... for... friendship... Fuck. Endre. Endre! Enosz! Enosz! Call an ambulance! Shit. - Do it! - But Dad! If they come here now... we're fucked! You've got to go home. Go home. Now! And what about you? Fuck that bullshit, Dad! Mum's split, you'll get sent down, fuck's gonna happen to me and Mira? We gotta think of something. We chop him up or... drive his car into a flooded quarry. - It'll have a tracking system on it. - We make it look like an accident! With a bullet in his brain? Can't we put him in an acid bath? His head's already all mashed up anyway! Erase all the recordings! - What are doing? - Look away! - You wanna shoot him? - Look away! Okay, but why shoot a dead...? Fucking hell! Wipe it and bundle it in a rag. Put his car out of sight round the back. Move it! Then come and give me a hand! I dunno what you're up to, but wouldn't it have been better to do that before you shot him? Yeah, maybe. Fuck... Hi! - What are you doing here? - I was going to call, but I decided it'd be best if I came. But what... Is anything the matter? No, nothing. I just wanted to say sorry for what happened before. I dunno, I was dead upset. - Sorry I lost my temper. - I understand. Dad can be a real pain after a bit. He often freaks me out, too. I can absolutely understand why you chose him. Kálmán, I mean. He must be nice. He is. He's surprisingly laid-back. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I checked him out on the net. It says he's dead successful and all. Yes. You can get on if you really want to. You don't always have to blame the circumstances if you don't succeed. Yup. I was thinking how I'd like to meet him. To get to know him a bit... - Now? - Uh-huh! Okay, then! Come on! Surprise! Good evening, mister! This is my daughter, Mira! - Say hello! - Good evening! You can forget the misters! I've heard a lot about you. And Mira's heard a lot about you. That's why she wanted to meet you. We thought this would be the perfect opportunity. - Certainly. I'll lay another place! - Lovely! Come on, I'll show you round. This place is heavenly. There's designer stuff everywhere. It's delicious! Have some rustic bread! Janka baked it this morning. Mixed seeds! Mira's top of her year. She's going to study Law. To be honest, I've been thinking that I need some experience before starting uni. We've allowed her to work after school as long as it doesn't interfere with her studies. And what do you do? Well, to tell the truth, me and a friend are just looking for a job. And we thought it might be nice to work at Balabo. - At Balabo? - Uh-huh! I'm sure you could get them to take us on. I swear I knew nothing about this. This is not the way to go about things! To be frank, that shop has nothing to do with me. But you own it. Alright. I'm about to go on a business trip, but when I get back, I'll see what I can do. Thank you! But we need it now. If I can't find my friend a job, they'll take her away. I'm sorry, Mira, but this whole thing is rather confusing. They'll take her abroad. To be a prostitute. - You are joking, aren't you? - No, 'fraid not. - Who is this girl? - I said! One of my friends. This is serious. It's human trafficking. - The police must be informed. - We don't need them involved. She just needs a job! Or else she'll go to Basle! She'll go. Meaning she won't be taken. That puts it in a different light. If that's what your friend chooses, it's her business. - But she's got no choice! - We always have a choice. It's not obligatory to become a prostitute! But if she chooses the simplest way, well, that's her lookout. We haven't chosen the simplest way. We'd do anything! Alright, I'm sure Kálmán will have a look around. And we'll find a suitable solution. Am I right, Kálmán? Of course! So? You'll get us in at Balabo? Will you call them? I will! Thank you! Go ahead, 12507! 12507 reporting! We've got a real bad line here 12507, but shoot! Request for immediate backup! I've got two armed men, one's... 12507! What is your present status? I've done it. Just like you wanted! He never was a looker, now he's plain gross! My money? I delivered. I've got to get away. It's cool, cool it! Listen... - You sure it's all here? - Are you taking the piss? You know, we don't want any misunderstandings later. - I've just killed my best friend! - Count it! One, two, three, four... Okay. Smashing! - What about the body? - It's all yours! - Come on, we can't leave it here! - Because? The later they find him, the better for everyone. Stick him in the boot! Fuck off to the cornfields. Burn the car. Who's there? Who was that? Hey! When did Hollós get married? Not that long ago. To Andi Szabó. It was a hell of a bash. Uh-huh. Go and see who's there! I'd not do that. His skull'll cave in. - You'll not get him in the car. - Motherfucker! Shit! Police! Drop the gun! Attention! Police! Turn around! On your knees! Drop it! Hi, I'm here. 2 thousand and 50. Any change on you, Dad? That's all I've got. We're 100 short. We'll bring it next time! So what happened to the cash? I chucked it. In the warehouse. I had to! If they'd found it on me, that'd have been it! Soz... I wasn't aiming at you. What a trip, huh? I'm creeping about like a fucking ninja and then that shit, you get it? Fuck was it doing there? It goes crack, and I'm like, okay! Talk about close shaves! And that bastard ring! How the fuck did we miss it? It's sticking out big as my knob-end, but we just leave it there! That face! It'll be burned into my retinas for keeps. What a fucking plan! What a brilliant fucking plan! And we nailed it! - Ta-daa! - Wow! - How does it look? - Wicked! And these? To our new jobs and our new life! To getting strings pulled! To everyone getting strings pulled. To your mum, too, for ditching such cool duds! Hang on. Wow, that's brill! It tickles! This is great. Hey! Mmm, lovely! No, no, no, no... - I'm not taking you back to detox. - Yeah, you look after me. Mira! - Hello! - Dad... This is my friend, Oszi. She's sleeping here tonight. - Good evening! Hi! - Hello! We've had a really tough day. I don't mind you enjoying yourselves, but do it quietly, alright? We were just getting ready for bed anyway. Thanks! - I'll find you a towel. - Thanks! - Mira? - What? It's okay, we'll tidy up! Come here a second. - But I'm all wet. - It doesn't matter. Is everything alright? Sure. Now go and get yourself dry. Your dad's pretty freaked, huh? That your mum took off. Yeah, it looks like it. They didn't get on? It wasn't that bad. I reckon Dad's the only one who could put up with Mum. But all she cares about is money. I wasn't surprised she ran off as soon as the shit started. You and me'll be alright, honey. I'm so stupid! I should've known something was up when she just... It's good you could handle it so well! You do know I'm not going to give them a job, don't you? - But you'd only have to make a call! - We agreed. No boosting. I don't want it to dictate our life. - A favour here, a handout there... - But... As long as they suck the golden tit, they'll never stand on their own feet. I wouldn't even do it for my own child. Stop torturing yourself. I hate it when you're sad. The woman I love's all smiles! I ought to keep a closer eye on her! I can't leave her with her father! - I don't think that'd be a good idea. - Attila's so lax! Yes, but our kids aren't babies anymore. Mira herself said that she wants to fly the nest. I was thinking that you might come with me. You could do with a break! I don't know. I always feel surplus to requirements on business trips. It takes 5 days to establish a company on the Seychelles. But I thought we might stay on a bit longer. A month, say, far from civilization. We could rent a chalet by the beach. We'd never even need to get dressed. Kálmán! I'd love to! Now that's the woman I love! Can't sleep? We never wanted it. It was him. Cop or no cop... If he hadn't tried to con us, if he'd let you go... We can't help it now. I'm sick of those smartarses who say there's always a choice, that things can always be different. It's bollocks! Some people are born for this, some for that. Some are good at this, some at that. But everyone's trying to get by. But you don't half get fucked when the bill comes. So what's the point? I'm going to bed. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, son! Good morning! DCI Jakab Erika. I'm heading the investigation into the murder of Zsolt Komáromi. I want to speak to my lawyer! You can. But first I'd like you to answer a few questions. And I'd like someone to get these bloody things off me! What were you doing yesterday evening at unit 228 on the Soroksár estate? I want to sell the place, I went to check it over. And how did that turn into a firefight? How was Komáromi's face rendered unrecognizable? I can't remember. Can you remember what time you arrived there? Look, madam, I've been seriously wounded here! - How were you wounded? - I don't know. Didn't I say I should be the first to know when Mr Hollós came to? - How are you? - I've been better, thank you! - These cuffs chafe a bit! - DCI! This is totally unnecessary. Mr Hollós was a victim of yesterday's incident. DCS! The forensics report and the statements reveal a number of discrepancies. - Every suspect... - I've read the report! Even a rookie could see Tomcsa and his sidekick are lying! What do you expect from a cop killer? Tomcsa? We have recently connected him with the Gyáli Road shooting incident. I gave the case to DI Komáromi. He probably trailed Tomcsa to the warehouse. When you were attacked, he must have intervened. And that cost him his life... - It's thanks to him that you are here now. - I hope he will be decorated. How were you able to dress the wound all by yourself? Look, DCI, I don't know if your life has ever been in the balance. But at such times you simply act instinctively. I believe we've heard enough. The whole thing is crystal clear. Come along, DCI, I'll give you a lift back to the station. Goodbye, madam. Naturally I shall have those handcuffs removed right away. And we'll find you a more agreeable ward. Thank you! - Good morning! - Good morning! Good morning! Excuse me, I'd like to speak to the manager! An exchange? Employment. We've no vacancies right now. - Would you call the manager, please! - I'm the manager. Oh. In that case, it's like this... Kálmán Csér sent us. - Who? - Kálmán Csér. The CEO. He owns this place. Well, I haven't been informed! Then can I speak to your superior? Come on, let's go. Hang on a minute! Hi! Hi! Listen, I'm in a fix. We're at the store, but they claim Kálmán never called them. - Mira... - Is he there? Can I speak to him? The thing is... I'm afraid he can't help you. What? But he promised! Because you forced him to. You made it very uncomfortable for us! Me? I made it uncomfortable for you? You haven't a fucking clue! I'm sorry! Would you show me your bags, please? I don't believe it! It's so typical of her! She hooks up with the biggest dickhead going! It was too good to be true anyway. I'm gonna go and pack. I can still catch that bus. Don't be like that! We can't give up after the first knock-back! Listen, I could call Márk's godfather, he's got this delivery firm. Or we could hand out flyers, - work in a takeaway... - Mira! Stop it! Listen! It's dead good we gave it a try! But that's it. Let's forget the whole fucking thing! What is it? Is anything the matter? Mira called. And? She took it pretty badly. She'll understand when she's older! It was in her best interests! Kálmán! I'm sorry, but I'm not going! I see. - So that's it, then? - Oh, no... I don't want to break up, only... Go on your own now. We can go together next time. Next time? Janka, let's be realistic! If we stay here now, our life will revolve around what your kids want. - There'll always be something. - Things are a just bit difficult now. Well, they're never going to be easy. That's the way of the world. So decide what you want to do. I still haven't transferred that money to the foundation. What? Are you trying to blackmail me? Of course not. I'm just presenting you with the facts. Like you did to me! And this is how you do it? I want you to come with me. What do you take me for? I'm sorry, Janka! But you've become very important to me! I love you. You're a smart, attractive woman. The kind I've always dreamed of. I don't mind our relationship always being so emotional and... yes, it does require financial sacrifices from me. But now I want you to make a sacrifice, too. For me. For us! Love me? Of course I do! Then hurry up! Atti! - Nice. - Uh-huh! It's comfier than the nick. I got off quite nicely. Even like this... But he's had his chips! COP KILLER CAUGHT RED-HANDED That's what you get if you fuck with me. Buggered for life. Don't reckon the twat will ever get out. Hats off to you, pal. Honestly, I'd never have expected it of you! It sounds like you think I ought to be proud of myself... You made a pretty clean sweep! And you and me are squeaky clean, while the cunts are either 6 feet under or banged up. I wonder what your old boy would say? He'd be made up. Cos he was right about me. That's it, then, right? So long, Enosz! Hey, Atti! Let's not cross each other's paths anymore. Hello. What's new? Whap it in! - Don't forget the napkins! - Okay! - Alright, Dad? ! Hi! - Hi, kids! Sorry I'm late. That prick was giving me an earful again. No probs, I'm just finished! - Bring the creme fraiche? - I said I would. - When did it expire? - Only 2 days ago, it's fine! That strawberry yoghurt had me on the bog for hours! It wasn't the yoghurt! You know the best-before's always far too early. It's ready! - Sit down! - Coming! - Bon appétit! - Bon appétit! Bon appétit! - Congratulations on passing your test! - Thanks! You see? It can be done without kickbacks! - Many happy returns, son! - Happy birthday! Thanks! Hello! Come and sit down. Get another plate, Mira! Happy birthday! Thank you! It's an exotic instrument. A kalimba. From Africa... Many happy returns, Little Plum! - Did you make a wish? - Mum! Okay... It doesn't matter... You're old enough to vote now anyway! - Where did you buy it? - We baked it. Really? That's super! Mmm! It's delicious! - What's in it? Stevia? - Sugar.
