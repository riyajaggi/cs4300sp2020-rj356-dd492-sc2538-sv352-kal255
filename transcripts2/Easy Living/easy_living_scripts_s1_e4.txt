 Come on in! - What was so urgent? - Hello! Hello! Attila Miklósi, Tibi's brother. Cynthia. Well? - We've been screwed, well screwed. - What? They've robbed us blind! The tilers, the project manager. - The whole gang must've been in on it. - The fuck you on about? You gonna fucking tell me what's up? It's the walls. They're all plasterboard. Where'd you get that from? I drilled through a water pipe. - I had to strip the wall back. - You clumsy twat!

 - Bye-bye, boys! - Ciao! Did it get very wet? Tibi! Did you know? We rationalized the plans. The supporting walls are kosher, the rest's only for show anyway. Fucking class! You made a big mess, huh? Fucking wonderful, the inspection's tomorrow. We can't show them it like this. Attila... Calm down! We replace the damp bit, repaint it, and bingo. - They won't pass it. - They will! I'll make sure they will. I always forget how lovely this city is! I ought to come down here more often. I was that knocked out when I first saw Castle Hill all lit up! I must have been 16. You lived abroad? In the sticks. Let's get a bottle of wine and go down to the river. It'd be nicer on my terrace! Thank you! Sorry, we're not there yet! I'm sorry, but I'm going home. Just a bit further. Well, then... Goodnight! Fucking potholes! Sorry! They've been there six months now! Goodnight! Dinner's ready! Get a load of this, baby! - Where did you find it? - A skip! A lick of paint and wow! - You're joining us, Mira? - I'm not hungry, thanks! Come on, you're as thin as a rake! - Drop of wine? - No, thanks. I don't like it! You'll like this! Fresh and fruity! Oh! The simplest and best grub in the world! We had it every day for 6 months in Bologna! - What were you doing in Bologna? - Studying. - Well, one of us was! - I was, too! - What? - Skinning up with one hand... - Aperi-spliff? - Mira? Oh, no. No, thanks! It's okay, it won't hurt baby! His mum needs a few kicks, too! Anyone want some or can I finish it? Shit! - Don't know where Uncle Endre is, do you? - Why? - I need to speak to him. - What about? He asked me to feed his dogs, but I can't find their food. - He's been switched off for 2 days. - Forget it, I'll see to it. But where is he? In custody. What? He's in prison? It's nothing serious. Some problem with his books. - Finished? - Uh-huh. - It'll have to dry. - It'll have time later! Anyone'd notice this bit's been redone! Not if he didn't want to! And this chap won't. He's got half a million reasons not to. Clean yourself up. Here's our man now! Good morning! - Mrs Berek. - Tibor Miklósi. Good morning! Attila Miklósi. - Brothers? - Yes. That's nice! That you can work together. It's a rare thing nowadays. - Where shall we start? - Over there, perhaps. - Our man, huh? What the fuck now? - Relax! Leave it to me! This socket is in an entirely different place to on the blueprint. It's a serious problem. But as it's easy to put right, I think we can continue regardless. He's coming! Hello! - Got a minute? - What for? I've brought you something. I'll catch you up. Okay! Sorry about yesterday! I'm sorry. Thanks. But no, thanks. How about dinner tonight at least? I can't. Luca's having a party. I wanna talk! That's funny! We've got the same tiles in our bathroom. We got them from Milan, a limited edition. They're Milan tiles, alright. Well, I do believe we're done. I've made a note about that socket, but the tenants can move in. Goodbye! Oh, there's paint on your jacket! Oh dear! Why is the paint still wet? Just a little touching up! Why was this repainted? There was a little mark. What was it, Attila? - This isn't brick! - Oh, it is. It's that new Ytong! - What are you doing? - The new Ytong, huh? Damn me! You couldn't even put any insulation in! The plans changed! You're one of the worst cowboys I've ever come across! Did you really think you could pull it off? - Listen, madam, - You listen! If you ever want to get through an inspection, you'll pull this whole shitheap down and start again following the blueprint inch by inch. I'll take a magnifying glass to all of your flats. And I'll be knocking on every fucking wall you've built! That's a promise! There does seem to have been a serious slip-up. But I'm sure that we can find a solution. If you do not put that money away this instant, I'll call the police! What the fuck were you thinking of? You build a flat out of paper and expect no one's gonna notice? And if a different inspector to the one you'd bribed showed up? No plan B? Okay, give me back what's left of my cash. You're kidding me, aren't you? You've blown the lot? But the other flats are done properly, aren't they? - Oh, fuck it, Tibi! - I'm sorry, Atti! How about this? Klári must have written five times about those potholes, and they never once so much as replied. Some bigwig must have moved here. You said there was something I could maybe help you with. The road is smooth, the road is smooth. The road is rough, the road is rough. Pothole! Any more holes need filling? I've talked to Hollós. He's got this job. I'm going away for 2 days. What about your flats? You were right. I'm not cut out for a bib and braces. You've finally come to your senses! I'll be back on Sunday! - I'm coming with you! - I'm not sure it'd be a good idea. But I need a break! And it's ages since we went anywhere together! I don't want you getting into trouble! Remember when we used to bring used cars from West Germany? Remember those nights outside the Bad Schandau services? That was in East Germany. You've got the wrong man! When do we leave? It's okay, I won't be under your feet! I can wait in the hotel! Yes, my wife and I. Half-board. Perfect! Thank you! And what exactly does this Rustic fun involve? I see, then we'd like that, too. Thank you, goodbye! Hi, Rosie! You expecting or just obese? Give us a kiss! - Bye, you two! - Ciao! Kiss-kiss! That top looks awful! Did you find it in a bin? You've got such a nice figure! Why go hiding it? Bye-bye! - At last! Two days off! - I'm throwing a party tonight! Shouldn't you have asked me about it first? You sound like Mum! Be glad they've pissed off for a while! I'll be home late anyway. I've got a group of Belgians! Just don't bring them back here! Tommyboy! Get your shit together, limpdick, it's party time! Hello, Vivi! I said before. I'm going to Luca's party! Come on, girl! The party's at Miklósi's place! You might've phoned! But his place is a mansion compared to ours! That's right, baby! Crank it up! Muffhunterz! Hold this! - Hey, G! We're out of champers, soz! - No fucking worries! They're up to something again! Good evening! - Good evening! - Good evening! - Your parents? - Gone on a trip. You seem to be having a big celebration! Something like that. My wife is just back from hospital. She needs rest. - I take it there'll be no trouble! - Trouble? - With the volume. - Oh, we'll have no trouble with that. - Come and dance! - Get fucked! Still sore about last night? I'm sorry, really, but it won't happen again! Do you know how fucking scared I was? Course I do! Them two were mental! We were in the wrong place at the wrong time! I've never felt this good with anyone before! - Yo, G! Flip us 30k! - I'll flip ya my prick! Tight-arse! It'll be fuckin' bangin'! It's that too. Chucking your money about! Why d'you have to act so flash? They want a good time. I don't care about money! All I care about is you! God, they're pathetic! If I turn into an old whore like her, kill me! Atti! What's up? - They ought to have called by now! - Loosen up a bit! They'll call! - Fancy another one? - You bet! 2 gin and tonics, please! Room 6, Miklósi. I'm made of ice! Maybe I'll never melt! Reach out your hands... They don't write tunes like that anymore. Same again! What can I get you, Attila? I'm alright, thanks. 6 a.m. in the car park. We'll go to Uzhhorod. I'll introduce you to Vitya. I love you, I'm right by your side! We're all set! When was the last time we danced? All I remember is how it turned out. - You're beautiful! - Thanks, you've not told me for ages. ...I simply couldn't live! Sand in the wind now... I'm like Pavlov's dog, me. Give us a hug! Mind my earrings! Sand in the wind now, I know that's all I am! Sand in the wind now, too late to change this man! When I am a rich man I will buy myself a fine aeroplane. I'll fly like a swallow so high, up above the sun and the rain. Everywhere I go, oh, all the folks will stew! Jealous of the money that I spend on you. Money's nothing next to true love if you are my sweet little dove! This is what I'm cut out for. I don't want to disappoint you, but you're still a crap dancer! The job. Hollós. This whole thing. Why change a winning formula? Don't be silly! Don't be silly! Attila! Don't be stupid! No! Let's go inside. No! Let's go in. No! No, no! - Look what I got! - You rock! I wanna show you something! I made it for you! - What is it? - It's in my room! - Oh, sure! - It is! Muffhunterz! Jeez, that's gross! Vivi! Wait! Wait! I didn't know about it! - Does the night bus stop here? - Please! Let me show you what I made for you! It's not quite ready yet. I'm gonna work on the beat. Some days are bad, some days are kicks. One thing never changes, the selfie fix I get when I see you up on our wall. I ain't no nerd, don't make me lose my cool. Like the way you pose, like your smile so bright. Like your shorts, I like how they're tight. Shake the bubbly, and come down poolside, come under the water, look deep into my eyes. I hate myself, it won't happen again. Just wanna say this, trust me, Vivien! Hey, trust me, Vivien! It's not meta, that. I'll give you everything I have! What's wrong? Nice party! Inherited it, did you? Hope there's still some of that 50 million left! What 50 million? Fuck! Where is it? - Where is it? - Listen... - I can't hear you! Where is it? - I'll tell Uncle Endre everything! I've a better idea. Keep it shut about the cash! Do what you like with your share, but half of it's mine! - So you owe me 25 mil! - I don't know where it is! Honestly! I'll be back for it tomorrow! Don't! - No, don't! - Leave me alone. Please! - Don't do this! - Leave me alone! Gyuka! Gyuka! Fuck you doing with that water pistol? Yeah? Be right there! - What is it? - The ice is here! I'll go. I wanted to check the girls anyway. Okay, then. We'll be right behind you. We'll just finish this! - I've got to go, too! - Where? - The Belgians are waiting. - Let them wait. What's up? You're high? You smell divine! Okay... I think... Seen the car key? What? We're in the way of the van. In my jacket. - She just... - You could see it doesn't bother her! If you're not into it, we can stop, okay? Where are you going? Hanna, I... I'm sorry! - I didn't want to. - What? You were up to your elbow in his jeans. But I didn't... You shouldn't have led him on. Making eyes at him! Why be surprised if he gets horny? Listen. Nothing happened. You got that? Nothing you didn't want to happen. Time slowly runs out, the game is almost over. Wind in your teeth howls, grit your teeth, bite down. Mechanism shrieks, grinds, can't stop, fucked now. Lose control, totalled, skull cracks, lose your mind. Now you see the dope for real, who's the liar in this deal? Got two bros on the road, tranks and taurine. All the fakers in detox bigging up about their bling. But I got me a VIP pass to my fuckin' dreams! - It's gone midnight! I asked you to keep it down and the noise is still blaring! I heard fireworks before as well! Turn it off or I'll call the police! Coming... We're almost ready! Get that down you! It'll wake you up! Well, ladies, who's going to hold the basin? All you need to do is catch the blood from its throat. I'll do it! Oh, sorry! Shall I hold it? Hello. Gimme another one! Just a tic! Jeez, what a nasty pig! Poor cow... Why aren't they loaded yet? I've got to be at the border on time! Relax! I'll have a word with him. Prices have gone up. They had another raid yesterday. Another 10,000 euros! I know you speak Hungarian. I'm off, me, cos you're not getting a penny more! And if you want to fuck with Hollós, good luck! Hey, Attila! Thanks! Who rinsed the guts? Oh, we only use ready-made skins these days, dearie. - The workers are thirsty! - Alright, just a minute! When I was little I always helped my grandma clean the guts. In a washtub in the chicken yard. It stank to high heaven. First you rinsed them in Vim or bicarb of soda, then used salt and onions to take away the taste of the chemicals. I'm not sure we wanted to know that! The only thing I hated was worms in the shit. But I was proud they'd trusted me with it. Drinks, everyone! Here you are. Cheers! Cheers! I've lived my life, it's true, now I'm nearly through. No more strength inside, to run and hide from time. I'm taking my last steps, let me rest in peace. Here I stand abandoned by hope, tears streaming down my face! You're lying... - Telki! - Good morning! Got the logs from Uzhhorod. I'll be late, the queue's massive! - How late? - It doesn't look good. At least an hour. - I go off duty in 10 minutes. - I'll never get there that soon! That's your problem! Shit! Up your arses! Stop! Stop right now! Stop! Out of the vehicle! Hands in the air! They've just called. The wife's gone into labour! It's a high-risk pregnancy. It was an IVF! - Stay down! - I promised her... - Hands behind your back! - Let me through! Here's the delivery note and everything! I'll leave the truck here. I'll get a taxi! We've waited 5 years! It's a breech birth! Hey, hey, hey! - What's going on? - He says his wife's in labour. - Where from? - Uzhhorod. - Destination? - Budapest. The Rainforest Woodyard. Off you go, I'll look after this! Didn't you hear? Scram! Sort out that Macedonian artic! Move it, you! Get up! - Your passport. - Thank you. Be a bit more discreet next time. Idiot! Here I am, Piroska. Open your bag! This is all there is, but it'll make a nice soup! - You take care. Bye! - Goodbye! Hi, Kálmán! Yeah, it's me. At a pig-killing. Yeah, with my bare hands. I don't know... sometime this afternoon. Okay. You've made good time! Attila Miklósi. - Where's Korsós? - He's out of action. Something he ate. - Everything go okay? - More or less. The key? Let me give you one in exchange. - No cash? - No. Not for a while now. It's safer like this. Didn't Endre say? Déli Station. Left luggage.
