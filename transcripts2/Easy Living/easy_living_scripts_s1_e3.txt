 The little buggers have never been skiing before. The Homes for All Foundation. 30 white roses, yes... And if there's anything else... We've not used them for 3 years. No? Well we will... We're going to ski ourselves silly... I only wore it once. I'll look the dog's bollocks in this! And if you've got a helmet... Your daughter's would be just right for Lizi. It's here somewhere. This is their first time. We'll be sticking to the children's slopes. Better safe than sorry.

 And we're not renting at Swiss prices. - Can I take these? - Sure, no problem. Much obliged! - Do you like herb goat's cheese? - It does my guts in. Shame, no one makes it like the Swiss. Sorry, Ted! - Hi, Uncle Endre! - Listen, kid. I won't be around for a few days. I want you to water the flowers and feed the dogs! Their food's in the garage, or you can buy something fresh. Is anything up? You in trouble? It's just a few days. I'll call you. - No Hummers? - No. But this is a great motor. It's all sweet: plates, VIN, the works. Another 200 grand'll get you papers. You're alright... I haven't even got a license! Time to go! Good morning! Feeling poorly? No. Then it's up and dressed! You'll be late! I don't care. Would you go now, please? - You're late as it is! - I don't care! What's happened? Has somebody hurt you? - What's wrong? - I don't feel like it. I'm sleepy. End of. We can't always do what we feel like... I know you're missing Chooker, but... you've got to get over it. Worse things than that happen. You should be thankful for what you've got! That you can go to school at all! Oh, big wow! You'll get nowhere without it! - You should know! - Yes, I do know. When I was your age I was doing double shifts at the Officers' Club. Getting groped by drunken soldiers then scrubbing pans until dawn. I had to go to night school. With no help from home. Unlike you. So now you can finish this performance and get dressed. Get off me! Imre! Morning! - How's the new lad doing? - He's a natural! - When that's done, go over to Yogi. - Okay! - So how d'you like it? - I'll have a few blisters, but it's good. You know, for the past 20 years I've only... I'm glad to be doing something useful. The estate agent's coming this afternoon. We'll be ready. And then you can pop round to Huszár Street! Tibi, we've not discussed my pay yet. - How much were you thinking of? - Nothing OTT. How much can you spare? Well, you're more than just some hired hand to me. They get 150,000. Cash in hand. Janka says we need 700,000 a month. - I'm sure you do, but... - I'll do an extra shift! And there's that other project. I'll work weekends... Listen, 400,000's the best I can do. But not a word to the others! And could you get me registered? - For my NI contributions. - Sure. If you only want 170 thou take-home. Okay... Forget it then. Thanks a lot! I've found another loft in Huszár Street. The tenders for local development will be out next week. We need the plans sharpish. Want to help? Sure! There's even more work on the horizon, I just need investors. I tell you, this is a gold mine. I'm proud of you! You've really made it! It was luck. This bloke in Munich showed me some places. Property's not on the rocks. You just need to know the right people. Okay, I've got some window frames to fill in. With Yogi... Bye, Tibi! Well, I rushed over to her, but I couldn't feel her pulse. - So I tried to revive her. - That was quick-thinking! But you know, I wasn't even thinking... I was just pumping up and down on her chest... - And how is she now? - I spoke to Ambrus yesterday. It might be months before she's fully recovered. - The poor thing. - I've sent some blooms in the foundation's name. So she'll know we're thinking of her. Yes, some situations call for prompt action... But life goes on, doesn't it? - Help yourself! - Thanks! I've found an EU grant that could fund the emergency hostel. Klári mentioned that you two had had a little difference of opinion. Oh, that's all smoothed over now. In fact we were discussing how I'd be happy to do more than just PR when... I'm sorry! I'm sure Klári wouldn't want her absence to hamper our progress. And the deadline is rather tight. It's an exceptional opportunity! I'll admit it's a bit fiddly. We need a sustainability impact assessment... An operations outline. A budget. And who's going to do all that? Well, I'm pretty familiar with it by now. I've contacted a proposal writer. I could put it together in a couple of days. At the most, I'll lose some sleep. - You're a wonder! - Oh, go on! - The hardest part will be the submission. - How's that? I'm not authorized to sign it. Only the chairlady is. But, until Klári's back on her feet, if I were to be voted interim chair... I can't keep running to the hospital just for a signature, can I? It does seem the most practical solution. Sorry, just a moment. - What the hell's this get-up? - I've been working. - What? - For Tibi, on his building project. Are you cracked? You said you wanted a proper job! We're renovating lofts! I get paid. What the hell's your problem? Don't you go inside! The committee's here. Fuck me! Are you really more ashamed of me for building flats than breaking into them? - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! - Attila Miklósi? - That's me. Zsolt Komáromi. Budapest Police. How can I help you? We can discuss that in my office! - Can't we do it here? - No, you'd best go! - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Do forgive me! - Those workmen are nothing but trouble! - What's been going on? Oh, he's been up to no good, it's nothing. I tell you, never build your own house! So...? - Interim chairlady: are we agreed? - Of course! Good afternoon! Take a seat. How did you manage to rack up such a debt? Well... we didn't plan it that way. Organic worms? Seriously? It seemed like a good idea. Everyone wanted in on it. But how you could borrow such a huge sum with practically no collateral? The worm farm was the collateral. Its net value. Things were different in the 90s. I pay the instalments each month! - What with? - I have a business. Maybe. But it doesn't run at a profit. And I work for my brother's firm. - Doing what? - Construction. All sorts of jobs. You're registered at the tax office, then? You live in quite a nice place for a labourer. - The house isn't mine. - That's true. It's owned by Future Investments Ltd. Head office: the Seychelles. And one of its owners is... Endre Hollós. - We have a rental contract. - I don't doubt that. - For the car, too? - Yes. This Hollós must be a real good pal of yours. Where were you on the evening of April 30, Attila? At home. Celebrating my wife's birthday with the family. - Why? - We have grounds to believe that your friend was in some way involved in the Gyáli Road shooting incident. I don't know anything about it. We've already arrested Hollós. But help us and you might get off. I'm sorry. I can't help you. Still, give me a call if you do remember anything! You've got mail... It's just come? School is only compulsory until 16. But with grades like yours, Mira, I can't see why... I wouldn't stop learning! I'd just be a homeschooler. But what's wrong, Mira? - Is there trouble at home? - No. No, it's just... And you'd give up your friends here, your work for the student council? You are an important member of our community! Talk to the school secretary! But you'll need parental consent. Marky G on the mic now, yo! Homies in the house, say what's up, bro? Muffhunterz, do what ya like. Now you see the dope for real: it's the golden life! - Golden fucking life! - Marky G knows the dope! It's not bad. Just needs more tits and ass! We gotta use this hot babe! That bootyshake was badass. - It'd be brill if that was in! - Put in it, guys! Then we pimp up the colours, mix a pro sound, and it's a wrap! There was this one, too... Markovits said he could do it in his old man's studio for 100k. Don't need it that slick for YouTube. Our old stuff's had loads of likes. But if we give it that little extra, it'll go viral, bitch! 100k to pimp up the colours? If we're tight-arses, we'll never step up a league. Here's 200. And make sure the bootyshake and that wriggling's in. Bye, then! Want a lift home? What in? - Is it your dad's? - It's mine. Just bought it. - Where'd you get so much cash? - You don't wanna know! Whoa, Márky! Where'd you nick this? Get to fuck! I'm picking up a hottie here! Vivi, wait! - This thing's wicked, Márky! - We going, or what? Thanks, Tomi... You're a number one ho-repellent. Any fuckin' time! - So what was all that about? - They've arrested Hollós. - What for? - I don't know. - And why did they want you? - To rat on him. You see? I got out just in time! And what's your job with Tibi like? It's good. I'm enjoying it. And your pay? - Cos you promised me 700,000 a month! - We could get by on a lot less! If you were to sacrifice a few luxuries. I've made enough sacrifices in my time. We don't need to heat the sauna up every second day... And we could turn the heating down at night! 19 degrees would be much healthier! Yeah, right, that'll save us a few hundred thousand! Can we talk? And as you can see from this budget, I've calculated that if I work six days a week in the café, I'll be earning about 120,000 per month. Before any tips. I'll be able to save a bit and pay my share of the bills, too. I heard that might come in handy. And what about your studies? I could be a homeschooler. It wouldn't cost a thing! I'd still get student discounts, too, so I'd be winning both ways. Only... This declaration needs signing. What is all this nonsense? You're getting straight A's! Why can't you go to school like any normal kid? You're trying to tell me what's normal? It's my life. I've the right to decide for myself! You've not only rights, you've responsibilities, too. You learn. I earn. I don't want your money. I can support myself! - Hi... - Hi. - Listen, still need help washing up? - Not really. That's a pity. But I do have something much more exciting. - When can you start? - Now. - How much time have you got? - Loads. You're already the best worker here! Here are all the pubs you can take them to, okay? Well? Well... They were pretty rough. Oh, here's... - Get real, any tips are yours. - You serious? Now it's straight home! You've got some Welshmen tomorrow. And they'll be at least as rough as them Irishmen. Metropolitan Prison Annexe 3 What's the charge? Moneylending. Someone's got it in for me. The whole thing's a joke, they've got nothing on me. I'll be out in two days. But while I'm stuck here, there's deals going down. That's what they want. I've just no idea who it is, or why... Anything I can do to help? I've got a truckful of logs stuck in Uzhhorod. I need it home double quick. I can't do it. I thought you wanted to help. I do. With what I can. Can you sell that house of mine? 4 Pipacs Street. The tenants don't want it anymore. It wasn't just because he was angry? He's squeezing me. So I'll keep doing his dirty work for him. Dirty work! You know how much we've got to thank him for! Think it'd be smart to start bootlegging for a bloke who's in custody? I might as well just pack my case and move into the next cell. Well, I'm not going anywhere! It finally feels like home here. What's the big deal? We could stay in the neighbourhood. Maybe find a decent-sized flat... A flat? And you know that moving all the time doesn't do the kids any good. It's why Mira's so flighty... Hey... What if we bought it? - What with? - The safe's bursting! - Know how much this place'd cost? - Then make our money work for us! Work for us? How? - Where are you going? - To work! Don't you wind me up! Mira, I'm sorry about what happened with Chooker, - but this is just childish! - Why? You won't let me learn at home, so I go to school. But what I do afterwards is none of your rotten business! I'm not done with you yet! If you could work in the Officers' Club, I can work in a café! The Officers' Club! Well done! - Thank you. - Feeling better? When... Mum told me about how... gross it was when... she got groped and hassled when she was my age... I thought she was just paranoid... that she must've been frigid, but... I don't like it... Hey, Hanna! Hanna! Come here a minute! This is Mira, the new girl. Mira, meet the wife. Hi! I'm Hanna. - She works here, too, but days usually. - Yeah. And this is Vili. Or Lili. We want it to be a surprise! He's got such a kick. Want to feel? Get a load of this! Janka Miklósi Foundation Chair... Nice! Only interim chair, but that would have been too wordy. And what's Klári going to say? Who cares? If we're lucky, she'll never walk again. Okay, see you later. You haven't forgotten the gala dinner? Tonight. At the Concert Hall. It's ever so important to me! I've got to impress them! Sure. I'll come straight home. Thank you! - Goodbye, have a nice day! - Bye! Estate agent: check! We've just got the building inspection to come and we're done! It really does look great! I'd not mind moving in myself! Tibi... You said you were looking for investors. Uh-huh, for Huszár Street. Why? Do you know anyone? Here's your school bus! - Coming? - Where? We'll pick up your bikini, then we can take a dip. - Where? - Are you coming or not? - What's that smell? - Chicken heads. What? You live here? Right now, yeah. How d'you like it? Don't be scared! - Won't they bite? - Not while I'm here. They're huge! No servants? Shit! No, no! Fucking hell! - What? - Sweetheart, listen, there's been a glitch and... I can't make your dinner. I don't believe it! I ask you to do one thing for me... You never take me seriously... I'm sorry, sweetheart, you know... Hello? - Yes? - Good evening. Sorry to disturb you. I just wanted to say thank you for what you did. Please accept these! You may have had your differences... but the fact that your humanity surmounted any grievances... If you hadn't begun to resuscitate her... I just don't know if Klári... So... Thank you... Thank you very much! Invitation The Homes for All Foundation Well, I'm bored to death with the multinationals preaching about their role in society. But we cultivate it, too, my dear. Sure. To get into the papers, to convince your workforce their daily grind's worth it. But we all know it's just window-dressing. Marketing. And in your opinion what could we do that would be more than mere window-dressing? Entrust it to experts. We're here to help. With more than hot air. We help truly needy people in a traceable and transparent way. Do excuse me. I see Szikszai's arrived. He's all mouth and trousers. The CEO of FerroGlobe? I wouldn't necessarily put it like that. Right now he's with the parliamentary speaker. Well, it looks like I blew it, then. Don't lose heart. I like that blunt approach. - Window-dressing... - I wanted to say farting downwind, - but it seemed a bit crude. - Window-dressing was perfect. And what are your feelings about corporate responsibility? - Let's have some more bubbly! - I'll get the other bottle! Alright, son? What are you to Hollós? His... his... godson. Know the password? Márk? If I can't open that thing, my mate's gonna do your girl. Márk? His birthday's in autumn. October 27, I think! Which year was he born? Let me look! 27.10.68. What's the git's hobby? Dogs! He loves his dogs. Rosie, Philip. Philip, Rosie. No. One last chance before we give the little cow a proper seeing to. He said his memory's shot, he writes his passwords down. But where? - Well? - 13.05.97! You're a lucky boy! Who you calling? Who do you think? The police! - The fucking animals... - You mustn't tell anyone! You what? Are you nuts? Didn't you see what he was doing to me? I'll sort them out, okay? Trust me! - But we leave the pigs out of this! - Take me home! I'll call you a cab, alright? Alright? Pick yourself a top while I get this in soak. You look great! - It suits you! - Thanks! A little trick of the trade. - When the sun goes down... - Do you have to do it? If we didn't, we'd have to shut up shop. You don't know how much we have to pay. And who to. And there'll be another mouth to feed soon. Sorry. I didn't know things were that bad. No problem! I never imagined it'd be like this myself. I'm still not sure that bringing up a kid in a pub's such a good idea. I dunno if depends on that. I can think of worse mothers. I'm sure you'll make a great mother! She'd been lacking confidence for some time, and in such a role quick decisions are a must. Naturally we envisage the changeover as a gradual and discrete process. To bow out with honour would be the least Klári deserves! Zsuzsa! The future of Hungarian education is finally in safe hands. It's rare that the right person is appointed to the right position. - You're a dangerous man, Csér! - Has Janka mentioned the foundation? Yes. That's another thing that is now in safe hands. It's been a pleasure. Likewise, Minister. May I have the honour of one of your cards? Who do you want to introduce me to now? No one. From now on, you're all mine. What did they look like? I reckon one of them was him who shot at us before. The other was dead tall, had this topknot, a fucking Comanche cunt. - What did they take? - Just Uncle Endre's laptop. And what were you doing here? Uncle Endre asked me to feed his dogs. Know where he is? I can't get hold of him. Whose is that jeep on the drive? Mine. Someone's flush! I inherited it from my granddad. - We've got to talk to Uncle Endre! - That ain't so easy right now! I saw the police commissioner by the vegetable samosas! That's who I bought it from.
