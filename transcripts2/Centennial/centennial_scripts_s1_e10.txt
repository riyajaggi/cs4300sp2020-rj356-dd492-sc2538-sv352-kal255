 They called it the Age of Opportunity, and no title for its time was ever more appropriate. The future hurtled toward the town of Centennial on the winds of fortune. And men worked to harness those winds, winds that swept new money westward. Fresh Eastern dollars to swell Charlotte Seccombe's already vast Venneford cattle ranch. To consolidate the holdings of Messmore Garrett and his family. To enrich Hans Brumbaugh, whose farm poured product into the newly organized Central Beet Factory. But the winds of fortune created darker opportunities as well. Dreadful opportunities.

 Near the end of the 19th century, a Minnesota businessman named Soren Sorenson disappeared from the face of the earth. And a family named Wendell founded its future power and prestige on 5,500 stolen dollars and a murder. What's the matter, Philip? Nobody home? Oh, hi, Miss Zendt. No, I guess not. Well, Mr. Timkins says the message isn't too important. So, I guess I can put it under the... I can tell you where he was. Beaver Creek. Something to do with that poor man, Mr. Sorenson, I believe. Oh, well, does the Sheriff figure that he drowned himself then? I guess he must. He's got I don't know how many men out there dragging the creek bottom. Oh, well, maybe I better try to find Mr. Dumire then.

 This might be more important than I thought. Thanks, Miss Zendt. Hey, Vern! Try over there. All right. Maybe I ought to head downstream. Yeah, there's a body in here. Vern! Vern! Poke through them reeds behind you. There's a lot of roots right under you there, Dave. Clean them all out. All right. Well. It's been a while since you come calling. Well, you said you don't want me around your office anymore. You know why, don't you? No, sir. What you got there? Any answer? Nope. Phil, we was pretty good friends there for a while. You almost wound up being a Deputy, you know that? I know. That's what I sure wanted, Sheriff. Can't pin a badge on a liar. I never lied to you, Sheriff. But you never told me the truth, either. Not about Sorenson. Now let me give you the facts in this case, Phil. Sorenson come into town. He had $5,500 with him to buy some land. He went to see Miss Garrett's party. Got there about 9:00. 9:30, he left there with your mom. Nobody's ever seen him or his money since. Now, if they went home together and your dad was to break in on 'em, they had a fight and Sorenson got killed, there's no jury in the world that's gonna call it first degree murder. You understand? I mean, nobody's gonna get hung. Now, what happened that night, Phil? Where's the body? Sheriff? I got ahold of something here. I don't know what it is, but it's heavy. Give him a hand there. It's a log. No, that ain't him! Wait a minute. Wait a minute, boy. Don't want your tip? Or don't you need it so much anymore? Hey, Brumbaugh. Yep. Yep. Well, what's the matter with you? You look like you're waiting for the end of the world. Price of sugar beets gone down? Never been higher. And what the blazes you lollygagging around here for anyhow? I thought a ranch foreman was supposed to be out taking care of his cows. That's what I'm doing. I'm buying them fodder. Beets? Well, it's a sort of by-product. There's a sort of pulp left after the beets are pressed and drained. Then I mix it with low-grade black molasses. You'd feed those poor beast anything. Oh, they love it. They thrive on it. As a matter of fact, I just signed a contract to buy half the pulp your factory here could produce for the next five years. It's 50% of nothing. What do you mean? Well, you can't have pulp without beets. And you can't have beets without workers. Someone has got to plant them, block them, thin them. I'll be danged if I can find anyone around here that's willing to do that next spring. Maybe you don't pay them enough. I could pay them the moon. It wouldn't make any difference. Nobody wants to work that hard for someone else. That's how I lost the Takemotos, the Russians, the Germans. They want their own farms. I can't blame them. Well, don't give up on the Mexicans yet. I told you I wrote Nacho Gomez down in Chihuahua. He'll probably send half his town up here. Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it. Hans, is this really a serious problem? It's serious enough for me to think about putting my farm on the market. I can't make it without any help, Jim. Well, maybe I ought to prod old Nacho a little. Yep. Yep. Is your husband here, Serafina? Captain, give me one minute, please. Tranquilino, you told me once you were a... What is all this crazy racket out here? Soldiers. Soldiers? See, I told you, civil war is coming. Yes. The workers of the mine strike and the government strikes back at them. This is a farming community, the silver mines don't concern us. No, the soldiers are here, there's a revolution coming. If it comes, it is God's will. It's General Terrayas' will! God doesn't own Chihuahua, General Terrayas does! Just stay out of this, Nacho. I came to talk to Tranquilino. You told me once you were a patriot. Was that true? True. Will you prove it? I've been asked to pick six brave men to do... To do a very hard job. I want you to be one of the men. What job? Why don't you go back to your nap, Nacho? What job? Executioners. Holy Mary. And just who is it that these patriots are supposed to murder? They're not supposed to murder anybody. They'll be asked to execute certain criminals according to the law. Oh, strikers, the silver miners, huh? These rebels happen to be silver miners, yes. Tranquilino. I told you before, I'm telling you now. Please, don't do this. Go to Colorado where you can earn a lot of money, where there is no danger. Father? I don't think it's good for young men to leave their families. And I believe in God, and the government. I am unshakably opposed to a rebellion against either. But, Father, I am a farmer. I feed the miners. I can't kill them. Is that the answer you want me to give Captain Salcedo? Salcedo? What Salcedo? Who is this? Is that the peacock on the horse? I'll go tell him. Nacho! Hey, look, I'm not afraid of these... I am afraid. I have a wife and a child to think about. You're not supposed to do this work out of fear, but out of love for the state. Of course, Father. Love. Keep your mouth shut and let me do this. What? Listen to me. I will go to Colorado with you when I come back. This could be a long, hard trip with all that blood on your head. At least I will have a head. Six men. Jim! Jim! Oh, that looks good. What were you doing over there by the corral? Oh, I was remembering. This was the first Line Camp John Skimmerhorn had me build. Do you miss those days, Jim? I miss the people. All the men I worked with on my first trail drive. Canby and Bufe Coker and Nate Person, and Nacho. And now which one was Nacho? Nacho was the cook. He was the best cook I ever saw. Well, that's not a very gentlemanly thing to say. Did you fry this chicken? Well, not exactly, but I watched. Well, this is good, it's good. But Nacho's was better. Maybe I'll have him take over your kitchen when he comes up. If he comes up. He didn't answer my last letter. I hope he's all right. He told me things were getting a little tense in Chihuahua. Revolution? Wouldn't surprise me. Oh, dear. You know, it's funny, the things you live to regret. I thought about writing him two years ago. Yes. Regret can tear one apart. I've always regretted selling this camp. I thought you liked trespassing. Isn't that why we come up here so often, Charlotte? Do you remember how long it took you to call me that? Even after Oliver died and you were appointed foreman, it was always "Mrs. Seccombe." We were talking about regret. Were we? Chances missed. Words that were never said. Well, I've got some words I've been wanting to say to you for a long time. And I think this is just about the best place. Before anything's said, I have to know how you feel about Clemma Zendt. I was in love with her. But it's over. She's gone. And I love you. Charlotte, will you marry me? Even though half the state's bound to gossip about the poor foreman taking advantage of the rich widow? You really worry about gossip? Not a damned bit. Ready. Aim. Fire! Next. Oh, Mother of God... There were no women in the mines. You think strikers' wives are incapable of causing trouble? Ready. Aim. Wait. Didn't you hear me, farmer? I will not kill women. Sergeant! - Find an extra blind-fold. - Just a minute. Father! Do you see? I know. Be still. Well, Father, how good of you to witness the executions. You didn't say there would be women to shoot. I beg your pardon. I didn't realize I was required to say so. It seems to me, Captain, that my villagers have proven their patriotism by now. Surely your soldiers can take over. That's not the point. I told you to be still. But he's right, you know. The point is that a conscript has refused to obey his captain's command. And that he's been condemned to die for it. Sir, I am absolutely astounded by the government's lack of sense. Indeed? Tell me, for instance, how do you intend to replace your strikers? There are Indians. Yes, frightened, underfed creatures. Now, look at this mestizo. Strong as an ox. And all you can think to do is kill him. Well, I'm not vindictive. All right. Life at hard labor in the mines. No! Don't shoot him! He's just going back to his own stable like a good horse. We'll pick him up when we finish here. Now then. Ready. Aim. Fire! Nacho! Nacho! I know. I know. I saw it from the hill. It was terrible. Don't talk. Catch your breath. We're leaving. I saddled two horses in the back. Where's Serafina? I sent her to your mother's with the children. Come on. All right. Ride all the way out to Ciudad Juárez. Right across the river there's a town called El Paso. I'll meet you in El Paso, at a bar called Kate's. Understand? I got this. Aren't you coming? Another way. I want to send the soldiers the wrong direction. They'll be here any minute. Go on. Going somewhere, Mr. Wendell? Sheriff, good day. Where you heading? To the saloon. It's my lunch hour. Is that a crime, sir? No, that ain't. See you around, Mr. Dumire. You can count on that. Yes, the railroad owns land all over this country. And I've seen it all. From Omaha to Denver, Salt Lake City. The job is just too big for one man, especially a stranger like me. What I need, really, is a local representative. Someone who knows the town. Someone with great enthusiasm. A salesman, farmer, scientist. That's a lot to ask for in one package. I know it is. But if the man exists, I can promise him a splendid opportunity. Excuse me. Excuse me, I wonder if I could bother you for the salt, please. No bother at all, sir. Thank you. Lovely weather we're having. Beautiful. Is it typical of the area? Oh, yes. As an agriculturist, I can assure you of that. As a... Agriculturist. I took my degree at Bonn. Really? And I can also assure you, sir, there is no finer weather for farming on this earth than right here in Centennial. Really? My name is Norriss, Mr... Wendell. Wendell. And I'm with the Union Pacific. This is a remarkable coincidence. I wonder if we might be more comfortable at one of the tables. Of course. Now then... Mr. Wendell, have you had any experience selling land? No, sir. No direct experience. But I've helped more than one acquaintance transfer his property. And I'll wager you did it with enthusiasm, too. Oh, well... If I were to ask you if you thought it would be a good idea for me to buy farmland in Centennial, what would you say? I would say you were the wisest man in all Christendom. We're in an undiscovered Garden of Eden here. Then if you had the land, you feel you could sell it fairly easily? My dear man, it would sell itself! The only question is where is the land to come from? My company, the Union Pacific owns thousands of acres along its right-of-way. All empty. Which is a very poor bargain indeed for the Union Pacific, if you follow my meaning. Oh, perfectly. A railroad needs freight to haul, produce, population... Especially population, Mr. Wendell. From the East, from the South, from Europe. And for that we need photographs and pamphlets to draw the people here. And agents to show the property when they arrive. My Lord, what noble work. Something you might consider undertaking yourself, Mr. Wendell? Myself, sir? It's an opportunity, Mr. Wendell. An opportunity. Well, I... I have no background in sales. You have what it takes, Mr. Wendell, enthusiasm and spirit. Well... And like you said, the land will sell itself. Mr. Norriss, I must tell you I'm very flattered by your suggestion, but... Well, we hardly know each other. Well, let me assure you, Mr. Wendell, that my interest and my offer are legitimate. I pride myself on being enough of a judge of character to say that you're a man I can trust. A man our clients can have real confidence in. By George, Mr. Norriss, I believe you and I may have a deal! Well, hello, Phil. Afternoon, Sheriff. Good day for fishing. Too bad we haven't got a pole. Yeah. You've been coming up here a lot lately. I don't see you swimming anymore. You used to swim around here all the time, didn't you? Well, because of my job, you know. Where'd you hide him, Phil? It's too bad you don't know nothing about the law. You'd realize they don't send a little boy to prison. Especially if he was to cooperate with the law. Wait a minute. You know what? That's pretty dumb. You forget I said that. I know you're not keeping quiet to protect yourself. You're thinking about your folks. I wouldn't expect you to tell on them, just so you could go scot-free. And I know you got a conscience, too. They've laid one hell of a load on you. You want to carry that around all your life? Oh, Mrs. Harlow. Mrs. Seccombe! What a pleasant surprise. We don't often get to see our best customer in person. Well, I don't often have to rearrange my accounts, Mr. Harlow. No, it's all right. I am not leaving the bank. I just wanted to have a word with your Trust Officer, warn him about a name change and so forth, I've decided to remarry. No! Well, splendid! And who's the lucky man? I am, sir. Well, congratulations, Mr. Lloyd! Thank you very much. I hope you'll be most happy, ma'am! I know I shall. Mrs. Seccombe, you just go right on inside and tell Mr. Green what you want. My wife and I have an errand to run. I'll leave you to business. Thank you. Morning. Hello, Jim. Axel, how are you? Not bad. What's so funny? Oh, nothing. It's just human nature. Makes you laugh, huh? Yeah. Makes me wanna throw up sometimes. No break in the Sorenson, huh? Sheriff! Wire just come in. Mr. Timkins said I should find you right away. Trouble? Somebody spotted the Pettis Gang outside of Cheyenne. Informant says they're on their way down here to kill Amos Calendar. They'll be getting here now. Well, I'm gonna round up a posse. Jim, you wanna go... Warn Amos? Yeah. Take Peterson's horse right there. Hey! Fool! Why don't you watch where you're going? Excuse me. Wasn't that Jim Lloyd? Yes. That was Mr. Lloyd. He a friend of yours? He was. I hope he still is. I don't believe I've caught the name. Clemma Zendt. Anything else, Brumbaugh? Bound to be, but I won't remember till I'm halfway home. Are you going to use those new workers from Mexico? Yeah, maybe. How are you, Mama? It's Clemma, Mr. Brumbaugh. Don't you remember me? Do I remember you? I remember the first time I saw you at your papa's old place. Where is Papa? Well, I... I know you have a lot to talk about. Go on down to the livery stable there, tell Clay I want him up here. Don't just stand there, go in the saloon and see who you can get! Axel! What's wrong? Town on fire? Worse than that. Pettis Gang's coming down here to kill Amos Calendar, and they ain't gonna stop at killing him. You know that better than I do, don't you? I'll get my gun. Meet us at Dooley's Road. Come on. Gonna make me a deputy? No, I ain't. Gonna write some wires. Come on. Hey, why are they after Mr. Calendar? Because they think he killed Frank and Orvid Pettis. That was a few years ago, before your time. I heard that there were a couple of other fellows on that killing, like Mr. Brumbaugh and Jim Lloyd. You hear a lot, don't you? Too bad you don't tell me all you know. Might have the makings of a sheriff yet. I was wondering when you were gonna show up. You recognize any of them? They're all some kind of kin to the Pettises. That's Roy Pearce behind that rock there. You know, Amos, I got to tell you I've seen better positions to defend. Yeah, I know. They'll all come splashing over here soon as they get up the nerve. Howdy, Jake. Mr. Lloyd. You know, somebody ought to go back and speed up the Sheriff. Where's your horses? They're out there behind us someplace. We cut them loose. Hey, Son? Yes, sir? Do you think you could make it back to town if we covered you? Yes, sir. I'm afraid that's the only way, Amos. All right, Son, yell when you're ready. Okay, I'm ready. Go, Jake. He made it. You know, in a way I'm glad this whole thing's coming to a head, aren't you? Just as long as it's not my head that it's coming to. Tell Timkins to get them wires right off. Oh, Mr. Dumire, I can't seem to locate my foreman. Oh, somebody should have told you. I had to borrow him. Borrow? Oh, it's the Pettis Gang, ma'am. But don't worry, the Sheriff will run them down. Get them wires off! The Pettis Gang? Aren't they the ones who... Yes, ma'am, and I'll get somebody to drive you home. Oh, no, it's all right, Mr. Dumire, but I can manage. Thank you. Sheriff! Sheriff! There's four of them out at my Pa's wagon. Jim get there? Yes, sir. Who was that, Mama? Charlotte Seccombe. From the Venneford Ranch. I thought so. She's prettier than ever. I guess that's what it's like when you have a mansion to live in, money to burn. A rich, handsome English husband. Her rich, handsome English husband killed himself, Clemma. Oh. Well, she shouldn't have any problem remarrying. Not the great lady of the manor. I hear she's already made her choice. Who, for heaven's sake? Jim Lloyd. But that's crazy. Jim Lloyd would never marry a woman like that. It wouldn't surprise me. It would me. It's awful quiet. Probably just reloading. Reminds me. Give me some shells. You are joking, I hope. You're out? I got one. I guess we can always throw rocks. Maybe they won't be crazy enough to try a straight-on rush. Roy Pearce is crazy enough to try anything. Get him. You know, that's the first time in my life, I've ever seen Roy Pearce run from a fight. It's the first time he's ever been outnumbered. You know, if you'd missed... Let's not think about it. That was just like our first trail drive with Skimmerhorn and Poteet. The way you dropped that Comanche Indian. Well, that seems like such a long time ago. Some rescue. Party's over with. There are three of them, dead or wounded on the other side of the stream. Roy Pearce done took off. Well, he ain't gonna get far. We sent wires to every peace officer within 100 miles. There ain't a town left he can hide in. Except one. Huh? Who's looking after Centennial? He wouldn't have the guts! He's as tough as any man I ever knew, Mr. Brumbaugh. Well, when did he run? He's smart as any man I ever knew, too, when it comes to fighting. If we don't get him, he'll be back. This time with the odds on his side. Let's check out his trail. The other side of the stream there. But what makes you think Pearce would ever come back into town? Tracks, Mr. Wendell. He's in town. He's not in the hotel. Well, he's someplace. Amos, you go on and go through the rest of the railroad yard. Take three men with you. Jim, three men down. Down to the alley behind the bank. Brumbaugh, you go through the cattle pens. Take three men with you. The rest of you, come with me. Now what are you doing here? Go on home! Yes, Philip, what do you think you're doing? You want a good whipping now? Go on! The Sheriff can handle this. If we're lucky, it may be the last thing he ever handles. Sure let us off the hook, wouldn't it, Son? Philip! Philip! Get back of the store. Axel, he's been here! Somebody's been here. Back door's open. Sheriff! On the roof! He isn't dead. Get the doctor! Sun's up. Why don't you go back to the ranch, Jim? I'll send for you if there's any... Well? I'm sorry. There is no hope. We can't even operate. The bullet's too close to his heart. I asked him if there was anyone he wanted to see. His answer surprised me. Young Philip Wendell. I'll get him. I don't know, I don't like it. Why should the Sheriff want to talk to Philip? It's unnatural. Doesn't matter. It's the last time. Give me his cap. No. I want my sheriff's hat. Philip... Can you believe it? Do you know what this means? No more spying, no more prying, no more questions and, my darling, we can spend the money! Some of it. Some of it, as long as it's not on anything foolish. No, nothing foolish. Nothing foolish. Nothing foolish. Land? Land. Yes. Yes, yes, land. If it's cheap enough. The deserts east of town along the railroad tracks. Oh, Mervin! What could be more foolish than that? For twenty-five cents an acre, I can pick up half of Colorado. Well, you could probably pick up half the Sahara for less. But no one intends to irrigate the Sahara or advertise it. And then appoint Mr. Mervin Wendell as official real estate agent for the entire shebang. What are you talking about? A fortune, Mrs. Wendell. I am talking about a fortune! Well... Good morning, Deputy. Morning, Sheriff. I wanna thank you for yelling. Yeah, but he still got the shot off. I know. Point is you yelled. Listen, Phil, this... This game we've been playing is about over. So I don't think it's gonna hurt anybody if we cheat a little here. Nobody can hear us. I gotta know where you hid that body, son. Now, it ain't the law this time, you understand? It ain't so somebody's gonna go to jail. Nothing like that. It's too late for that. It's just for me. I got a right to know. It's my job, see. I gotta... It's down in the creek, ain't it? Ain't that right, Phil? That day you was under the water so long. You told me you was in the reeds. But that was a lie, wasn't it? You was down under the water all that time. You found a hiding place. One good one nobody'd know about. Hole in the bank maybe? Cave. You lugged the body down there, but you was too smart to just throw it in the reeds 'cause you knew I'd find it if I dragged the bottom. That's why you were so scared that day, wasn't it? You knew I was coming close. I know, Phil. I know. Son, I ain't asking you to betray anybody. You don't even have to say nothing. Just nod your head if I'm right, will you? Just tell me... Sheriff? Sheriff? Sheriff! You were right! You were right! We did! You were right! Nacho? Nacho? What are we doing in this godforsaken wasteland? Are we talking about the same thing? It's beautiful to me. It's a desert. No. Niño, my life has been a desert, except for Serafina and you and the little one, and this... This trail... This trail where I rode with men who judged you by how you worked, not how you looked, or how you spoke. Señor, I no steal. Don't worry. What's that you're cooking? Ends, señor, only ends. So it is, but it sure smells like a lot more. You want some? Yeah, thanks. Mmm. Delicious. I haven't had anything tasted that good since back home in Minnesota. Minnesota? Where is that? You never heard of Minnesota? No, señor. Well, it's a place a long way from here. Good farmland. A farm, yes. I come from a farm, too. You know, Santa Ynez, in Mexico? Hmm. You a farmer? No, señor. Everything I plant won't even grow in Minnesota. But what I cook tastes good, sí? Best I ever tasted. So, what do you do? I cook. For who? No work now. How'd you like to ride for me? Tend to the horses, do the cooking? Where are you heading to, señor? Who knows. Wherever I can find a trail boss that'll drive a herd north for me. Where, to Kansas? Colorado. What's the matter? I've always wanted to see Colorado. Well, then, that's settled. R.J. Poteet! Poteet! I'm Poteet. I'm Skimmerhorn, down from Colorado. Well, what can I do for you, Mr. Skimmerhorn? I want you to put me together a good mixed herd. How many you need? Two, three thousand. Well, we can get them for you. Can you get them north? Well, you know, if we tried pushing them across Western Kansas, we'll be lucky to keep half the herd. I've tried that. What can we do? Well, there's another way, but I wouldn't want to force it on you. What way? Well, two years ago, a man named Goodnight... He was something. He headed 2,000 critters far south of here. Right straight across the desert then swung them north to Colorado and Wyoming. The desert? That way his greatest risk was nature not the Indians or outlaws. Could it be done again? It could. What are your terms? 80 cents a head for every animal I deliver. I pay the crew, you furnish the horses. Mr. Poteet, you're the man I've been looking for. Tomorrow we can put together the herd. You pick your men and we'll head north. Well, we can start buying right now. Let's go. Who's the Mexican? Nacho, he'll be the cook. Not on my trail, he won't. Hey, wait just a minute. What kind of cocinero are you to be calling me names? I am the cocinero who's gonna fill your big overblown belly when it's empty, and pour a bottle of pain killer in it when it's aching. I am the cocinero who's gonna hold your bets, settle your quarrels, listen to your complaints, and hear your confessions. I keep my wagon packed tight and my coffee's always hot. If I didn't think that you were testing me, señor, I would be holding this the way it should be held. And you... You will be blowing hot air out of more holes than one. He's a cook? I believe this is about the best branding I've ever been to. Damn good whiskey, too. I ain't had none this good since I was in Abilene with Old Old Dean Cleaver. Dean Cleaver? You know Old Old Dean? Know him? Me and Old Old Dean was in a brawl one night so bad, Old Old Dean woke up in the morning with a broken leg and one arm in a sling, his head in a bandage, one of his eyes was all black shut. That's Old Dean all right. Well, now he come to me the next morning. He says, "Bufe, what in the world happened last night?" And I told him, "Well, "you know that old Drummer boy? "Well, you bet him that you could jump out the window, "fly plum around the hotel "and come back in the very same window." You mean to tell me he was your friend and you let him do that? Let him, hell. I lost $10 on him myself. Well... Better drink up. That's the last whiskey anybody gets for months. There'll be no drinking. If I catch anybody on the trail with a bottle, he gets paid off fast. Less the cost of one horse, which he can take with him along with his own. Now, come on now, R.J. There'll be no gambling neither. What? None, absolutely none. Breeds discontent. I aim to ride a peaceful trail. You all right, Jim? I think so. Here, let me see that. Yes, it's just the crease. You got him. Yeah. These outlaws, Bufe, killers. Confederates. They killed Lazziter. And I killed my own brother. Do you understand that, Jim? I killed one of my own. Nacho, I'd like to have a board off your wagon. A board? I gotta at least put up a marker. Give us two, we'll need one for Lazziter. This is a hard trail, but it is a good trail, too, because it takes you to a good place, a wonderful place. Go to Colorado, Tranquilino. Go to Skimmerhorn, and Calendar, and Jim Lloyd. Let me give you that. And let me rest here where I was happy. Oh, Nacho. Beautiful, sir. Ravishing. Temperature for each month, rainfall, length of growing season... Oh, this is perfect. If this doesn't attract buyers, Mr. Wendell, nothing will. Well, sir, I'm pleased that you approve. Of course, I can't take all the credit. Well, I couldn't have done it without my favorite amanuensis here. Oh, Miss Keller, the English is impeccable. Finest teacher in the West, in my opinion. Mervin, you flatter me. Oh, not at all, my dear, not at all. Oh, Lord, 3:00. Can that be right? I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Norriss, I have a rehearsal. Oh, well, you go on, my friend, please. It's very kind of you. I'll be back in an hour. Maybe less. Rehearsal? Oh, there's a social at the church tonight. He sings. He and his wife. Is there anything in the world that man can't do? There's very little in the world he won't try to do. Hmm? Well, he's an actor. He's got the confidence of his breed. Well, how did he get from acting to agriculture? He didn't. He's never farmed an inch of land in his life. Never... Oh, he didn't write this either. I did. You mean he... He hoodwinked me? I couldn't have written it without his direction and his enthusiasm. And that's what's important. It won't be impeccable English that draws people to Colorado, Mr. Norriss. It'll be enthusiasm. Yes. Yes. I'll tell you what you do. Stay over and come to the social this evening. See him in his element, watch him manipulate a whole crowd of people. Listen to the mockingbird Listen to the mockingbird The mockingbird still singing o'er her grave Listen to the mockingbird Listen to the mockingbird Still singing where the weeping willows wave Bravo! It was beautiful, John. Angelic. Yeah. But where was Philip tonight? I don't think I've ever heard them sing without Philip. Oh, his mama says he's still broken up about Axel. She says that he said he's never gonna sing again. He'll get over it. Yeah. Listen, Hans, have you heard from Nacho Gomez yet? Nothing. I guess he and that nephew of his, they didn't need a job. Isn't it a little warm here? Oh, no. In fact, I'll get a smoke. Yes, why don't you do that? Jim? Are you real? I'm afraid we're a little late, Jim. You missed the singing. Well... You go ahead, Mama. I'll be along in a second. Clemma. I'll be right in. How long have you been here? You watched us walk up. You know what I mean, Clemma. Why didn't you let me know? Why didn't you come out to the ranch? I didn't know if you'd wanna see me again or not. Oh. I've made some terrible mistakes, Jim. But the worst of all was leaving you. Well, that's one mistake I'll never make again. You got a divorce? Mrs. Zendt, let me take this for you. I'm surprised Jim didn't help you in with it. Didn't you see him out there? Yes. I have seen him. Oh, is he all right? I don't know. Excuse me. Charlotte! Charlotte, let me explain. You get away from me. Yes, sir? I want to see Mrs. Seccombe. Mrs. Seccombe has retired, Mr. Lloyd. Mr. Lloyd! I'm sorry, Madam. It's all right, Wallace. Would you like me to... Go to bed. Well... There seems to be no end to the spectacle you're willing to make of yourself. I wanna talk to you. That's all that matters, is it? What you want? I thought I could get her out of my mind. I was wrong. I apologize. Suppose I won't accept your apology? Then that's how we're gonna have to leave it. It's all I can offer, I'm gonna marry her, Charlotte. Are you drunk? Marry her? If she'll have me. Oh, yes, she'll have you. Until the day she decides to get the next train East. No. She's changed. This is preposterous. I can't even get angry. Then you'll release me from our engagement? Oh, Jim, just go and ride your horse, or take a cold bath, you'll calm down. Well. I'll go now. I didn't mean to hurt you, Charlotte. What makes you think anything so comic could hurt? You about through here? About. That's good. Because I noticed another break over in the southeast corner, and I was thinking maybe we could... We'll get to it when we can, John! All right? You're the foreman. Cigar? No, thank you. You know, I bought these down at Zendt's place. You'll never guess who waited on me. I know she's back. You remember the first time you saw her? Just at the end of the first cattle drive. You asked me who she was, and I told you and then you said... You said to me, "Mr. Skimmerhorn, "that's the girl I'm gonna marry." The Cowboy and the Indian Princess, huh? Make a good title for a novel. Gee, I think I'll check that break now. Wait, Jim, listen, do you know what diplopia is? No, but I'll bet you're bound and determined to tell me. It means double vision. It's when you can't get two images into focus. Gives a man a terrible headache. Well, that's not my problem, Mr. Bones. I never had a headache in my life. Well, you've got one now, partner, and it's a beaut. John, you don't know a damn thing about Clemma and me. I know she's not a 14-year-old Indian princess anymore. She's changed and so have you. You just can't go back to that world, Jim. She came back. And this time I'm not gonna let her down. "Let her down"? Now is that what you said, "Let her down"? Now that is the dang thing... Hey! I don't see why I can't be married in white if I want to. Who makes these dumb rules anyway? Mrs. Zendt, would you mind if I had a word with your daughter alone? You stay right where you are, Mama. She's not the Queen of Sheba. Nobody has to bow down to her like some... I'll be in the back. It's so funny. When I was a little girl, my father used to say to me, "Charlotte, as long as you hide in the corner, "the hobgoblins are going to frighten you. "If you'd just open your eyes and look at them, "you'd see how little and weak they really are." And he was right. I can't imagine what in the world you're talking about. Why did you come back here, Clemma? I don't think that's any of your business. Oh, yes, indeed. You made it my business the minute you set up that wretched scene outside the church. I didn't set up anything! Jim Lloyd has loved me for 20 years. He wants to marry me, and he's going to marry me whether you like it or not. Jim Lloyd loves you. Not a word about you loving Jim Lloyd? I just figured you'd take that for granted, Mrs. Seccombe. Clemma, the only thing I take for granted is that you're going to be on the train for Chicago tomorrow morning. Oh, do you? As I was driving over here I wondered whether or not I'd have the nerve to do this, but you make it very easy. Your ticket money and a little left over for fun and surprises. Mrs. Seccombe, can't you tell when you've lost? No. I never could. Sometimes it takes me a while to sort things out. I toss and turn and stare at the ceiling. But sooner or later, I decide what it is I really want and I go after it. And this time what you really want is Jim. Yes. That's what I really want. Well, touch luck, Lady Bountiful, he's already spoken for. No, Clemma, you're the one with the tough luck because you're not dealing with a bedazzled gentleman now. You're going to be fighting toe-to-toe with me. And I'm the dirtiest fighter you've ever seen in your life. I kick and scream, scratch, gouge. I buy allies and information. I might even go so far as to hire detectives to find out where you've really been all these years. These long, lost years. You think about it. You forgot your money. I never forget anything. And when I dig up everything there is to know about you, I'll make sure Jim Lloyd never forgets, either. He's my last chance, Mama. No, Clemma. But this could be your last chance for some self-respect. This man? You say he was looking for Jim Lloyd? Well, I guess he was. He came in about an hour ago and handed me this piece of paper. Jim Lloyd written on it. But I didn't like the look of him so I acted dumb. Elkins says he saw him over at the railroad station. Young fella. Twenty-four, five... Didn't mention any names? Nacho Gomez? Anything like that? Not to me. Well... I guess I better take a look. Thanks, Eddie. Excuse me, amigo. Were you looking for Jim Lloyd? Sí. Good, because he's a friend of mine. My name's Skimmerhorn. Skimmerhorn! Yeah. You know, my Spanish isn't too good these days, Tranquilino. So maybe you could... It's okay... Nacho Gomez. Nacho Gomez, yeah, sure. He told me... Take this? No, no, no. Told me come here and work. This man... His name... Brum... Brumbaugh. Brumbaugh. Brumbaugh. Brumbaugh. Right. Nacho was supposed to be here. So where is he? He's... He's muerto. He's what? Dead. Well, I'm sorry. How? It's bad times in Chihuahua. It's guns... Shootings... Very bad. Well, we'll talk about that later, okay. Right now I wanna get you over to Brumbaugh's place. He'll be very glad to see you. Although I have a feeling he was expecting a little bigger delegation. Okay, are you ready? Yeah, come on. Morning, Jim. Morning. Train to Chicago. Clemma's on it. I saw her get onboard myself. The problem's over, Jim. I guess I better start at the beginning, huh? I don't suppose you know what these are? It's beet. Beet, yeah, but not an ordinary beet. Field beet. No, no... Sugar. Is that sugar? Sugar, si. I know. Well, well, well. Then you know what's wrong with this field? Plants... Too much... It's too many... More apart. Yeah. Chop. Okay? Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah! What are you doing here? Looking for you. She's gone. For good this time. What do you feel about that? Bruised. Relieved. Yes, I rather thought that might be your reaction. Where do you get your patience, Charlotte? Oh, God knows. Some inexhaustible, brainless source. Well, I'm afraid you're gonna need all you can find if you continue dealing with me. Unless I grow up damn fast. You're not doing so badly. At least you didn't go chasing across the prairies after the train. You came up here. Because I connect it with you. And picnics? And peace. You know, Jim, we really ought to be careful. Someday the new owner will catch us on his property and we'll wonder what's hit us. You don't have to wait until someday. The owner's here now. What do you mean? Means I bought the place back a little over a month ago. Why? To give to you as a wedding present. The honeymoon couple is back! Welcome home, Mrs. Lloyd. How did you like the Pacific Ocean? I tell you, the part we rode on was rougher than a cloud-hunting bronco with a belly full of bed-springs. Everything's all right? Couldn't be better. Couldn't be better. Well... Well, I'll let you get unpacked and settled in. I'll be in the office, Jim. Thanks, John. Ma'am. Oh, it's good to travel, but it's so much better to come home, isn't it? Anything interesting? Oh, Bristol. Oh. Oh, dear. Well, is something wrong? Got bad news? Yeah, in a way. It's from Finlay Perkin. Oh, now what's the matter with Mr. Doom, now? Won't his books balance? Aren't we earning enough money for the stockholders? I suppose we must be. He doesn't say. Oh, he congratulates us on our wedding and wishes us both long life and happiness. And... Then he mentions John. Oh, Skimmerhorn? "Of course, now that you and James are married, "it's no longer seemly for James to occupy "a secondary managerial position there. "The Bristol owners wish James to take over the post of General Manager, "and ask you to dispense with John Skimmerhorn's services immediately." Dispense? "Naturally, we can and shall give him the best recommendations." No! Jim... No! It's out of the question. Well, why is it out of the question? I mean, you know as much about running the ranch as he does and he'll certainly get another position. It is out of the question, Charlotte, because I owe everything in the world to that man. He hired me, not Seccombe and not Finlay Perkin. Yes. But still... Charlotte, John Skimmerhorn has a lifetime job at this ranch. You understand that. Now he can fire me, but he can't fire John. Tell Perkin I turned his damned offer down. Oh, never mind, I'll tell him myself. No. No, Jim, darling, I'll do it. I'll do it. You're quite right. Afternoon, Tranquilino. I brought you some fresh water. Gracie, señor. I believe your friends are every bit as good a worker as you are. Yes, pretty good. Good work. Tranquilino... What are you gonna do when the fields are thinned? I don't know. Maybe go to Oregon, pick fruit... I don't know. Wouldn't consider sticking around Centennial, would you? I need... I have... I send money home. Each week, I send money home. It's important. You got much of a family back there? Sí. Ever consider bringing them up here? Well... Well... Look it... I'm getting to be an old man and I need dependable workers, you know. I mean... Year in and year out, men like you. Now... If I was to find you a little house, rent-free, and guarantee you a job during the off-season, would you consider staying? Patrón... How I... I have no money. Well, I'll stake you. What do you say? Yes. You'll be through blocking next week and you'll leave. Just don't run out on me. Hey, no run out on you. You never. Listen to me, I swear. Come back here. He good for you. I believe you! He's good boy, he's strong. Working good for you. I believe you. Oh, there you are. Mail just arrived. Put it on the drawing room table. I'll get it later. Oh. Oh, there's one here with a Texas postmark. Oh, yeah? Who from? R.J. something... Poteet? Oh, God. Who's R.J. Poteet? He's a big rancher down in Palo Pinto County. He was the one who organized the first drive. Well, I'll be blasted. What? He says he's going in with a group of English financiers to start a ranch west of Jacksboro. But he doesn't wanna commit himself until he can get a good General Manager. He wants John Skimmerhorn. He wants John? Said he didn't wanna do anything behind my back. That's why he's writing to me first. What are you going to do? Talk to John. Do you think he will accept? I don't know. Well, I think it's a splendid offer for him. Don't you? Well, it doesn't matter much what we think, Charlotte. John Skimmerhorn's a man that carves his own trails. Yes. Yes, I know. Well, I guess I'll talk to John. Good evening. I need a room. You have? No. Sign. Plenty money. I don't give a damn if you own the mint. There ain't no rooms. Just a minute, greaser! No greaser! I work! You all right? Yeah, yeah. What the hell got into him? I don't know. These people are half crazy. Get the police. Matt, they're gonna need a charge. Well, anything! Assault! Hey. He robbed me, too. $20, tell them. That ought to put him away for a while. Yeah! Board! John. Yeah. Sure is gonna seem funny around here without you. After all these years. Well, you know I'd never leave, Jim, if I wasn't absolutely certain you could do the job just as well as me. Oh, and by the way, Mrs. Lloyd, if the retiring General Manager has any say about his successor, I'd like to give this young man my highest recommendation. I'll surely take your suggestion under the strongest advisement, Mr. Skimmerhorn. Good. Board! Last call! Well... You take care of yourself now, Jim, you hear me? Yeah, you, too. Mr. Poteet's getting the best man in the business. I guess you know that. Yeah. But you know, it's the luckiest thing that ever happened to me in my life. The way this whole thing turned out. Yeah, how's that? Well... John, you get aboard or they'll run off and leave you. Oh, yeah. Well, you see, Mr. Poteet wrote me a letter saying that he'd just started looking for a general manager. When out of the clear blue sky he gets this letter from Bristol, England, saying I might be available for the job. Bristol? Board! Well... Listen, Jim, I better be getting along. You take care of yourself, you hear? And you keep in touch. Ma'am. Goodbye. John. Goodbye, John. Okay. So long, Jim, ma'am. Bye, John. Goodbye. Are you mad at me? How can I get mad? I might as well get mad at the sun for rising. You ever gonna change? Why should I change when I'm always right? You wait and see, Jim. You're gonna be the best manager that Venneford ever had.
