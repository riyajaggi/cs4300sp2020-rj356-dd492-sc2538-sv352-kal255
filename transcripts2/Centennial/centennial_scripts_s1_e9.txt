 As the 19th century was drawing to a close, Centennial was hit by the most destructive blizzard ever recorded in Northern Colorado. Within hours the temperature had dropped to an incredible 45 degrees below zero, 16 inches of new snow had fallen. Cattle perished by the tens of thousands on the open range. For some, like Charlotte Seccombe and the Scottish accountant, Finlay Perkin, and especially for Oliver Seccombe, who had begun the mighty Venneford ranch,

 the great blizzard marked the end of an era. For Levi Zendt, it was the end of a lifetime. For the traveling actors, Mervin and Maude Wendell, it meant a brand new beginning. A new audience for old performances. For the frontier lawman Axel Dumire, it brought concern that his town, like others before it, would fall prey to a kind of crime the presence of his badge and gun could not prevent. But for most working men, like John Skimmerhorn and Jim Lloyd, it was simply the terrible white present, and its passing meant an end to the backbreaking effort to save what could be saved during a devastating tragedy.

 How many you think lived through it? Well, you add your count to the rest of the line camps, maybe 20,000. Is that all? Out of almost fifty? Fifty book count. Hey, John, I was talking to that Mr. Perkin the other day. He asked me if Mr. Seccombe had been cheating on the books. What'd you tell him? Well, I told him I never see the books. Good. John. You see the books. What do you think? I think it's a damn good thing that blizzard hit. Was Mr. Seccombe stealing? A man buys a pound of sand. How many grains has he got? I don't know. He can't tell. Suppose he wants to come up with a figure. He has to estimate it. Right? Right. And suppose his estimate is a little low. Does that mean somebody stole the rest? Good point. The funny thing is, Perkin'd probably understand the point about a pound of sand, but not about a herd of cattle. I've told that man a dozen times. Book count is an estimate. Just an estimate. Yeah. Still... Still what? Well, it's one thing to talk about sand running through your fingers. It's another thing to lose as many breed cows as we do. Thirty thousand longhorns missing. That's nearly a million dollars. And you have the gall to tell me they're lying out there in the snow, stiff as boards. It's the truth. Can you prove that? Can you prove otherwise? Very well. I can't sue. But I know that you're not fit to run this ranch, Seccombe, no matter what tricks this lassie comes up with. And when I return to London, I'll tell Lord Venneford as much and I'll tell your father and the rest of the investors. Mr. Perkin, there wouldn't be a Venneford ranch without my husband. My husband... Be still a moment, Charlotte, please. Mr. Perkin, you have my resignation. Oliver, he's bluffing. Now, he can't force you out! I'll go to London myself... Charlotte, Charlotte... Are you really surprised? Or are you just acting? I can't tell anymore. You shouldn't be surprised. I'm extraordinarily tired. It's time someone else took over. Well. You've made a very wise decision, Mr. Seccombe. I'll fetch a pen. Take the name of Jesus ever As a shield from every snare If temptations round you gather Breathe that holy name in prayer Precious name, O how sweet Hope of earth and joy of heaven Precious name Precious name O how sweet How sweet Hope of joy... Hope of earth And joy of heaven The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace. Amen Amen Amen It's nice to see you. Thank you for coming. Nice to see you and don't forget the church social tonight. It's nice to see you. I've never heard a hymn played with more skill or sung with more piety and devotion. I've said it before and I'll say it again. The Union Church was blessed when you chose to join the congregation. Together with your dear husband, of course, and your son. In fact... Now, Reverend Holly, not another word. You'll turn our heads. The fact is we were blessed when we were led to this lovely town. Weren't we, Maude? Really, really, everyone in Centennial has been so sweet. But none sweeter than you, Reverend. Oh, please, Mrs. Wendell. Oh, no, no, we were penniless and you found work for my husband. We needed shelter and you... You turned over your second house to us. I just can't imagine how we're ever going to repay you. Don't even think about it. Now, of course, we will expect you all to sing for your supper at the church social tonight. The social? Well, Whispering Hope. Listen to the Mockingbird? You do them so splendidly. Thank you, but would you settle for a solo from Maude instead of a trio? I don't believe I understand. I'm afraid I won't be there. I have to take a train to Denver this afternoon. It's a family matter, and Philip will be staying with his friend, Beeley Garrett. Mervin, I really wish you'd give me some warning when you decide to dash off like this. I was counting on you to... Oh, forgive me, precious, but everything happened so quickly. Oh, how in the world am I ever going to get all that food over here to the church? The food? Oh, the food. Oh, Lord. I nearly forgot the food. I have an idea. Now, it's no good your refusing because I insist. I will carry the food. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, no. It's so far out of your way! No, no. Nonsense! Not a bit of it. It's all settled. I'll be there at 7:00 sharp. Well, that's the last of them. Reverend Holly! You haven't packed the wagon yet. Oh, well, I'm sure we still have loads of time, haven't we? Yes. I hope Mr. Wendell got safely away this afternoon. Oh, thank you. Yes, he did indeed. He must be halfway to Denver by now. I'm so silly. But I guess that's just the kind of woman I am. What's that? I just... I just can't bear to be alone. I need a man. It's so unfair. I mean, men and women were meant to be together. I really don't see how you can stand it, Reverend Holly. Being a bachelor, I mean. You're so, so vigorous. So, so... Oh, dear Lord. Didn't you enjoy it? Yes. Maude? Maude, I'm home. May I come in? Maude. Mr. Wendell, listen to me, please. You filthy... Mr. Wendell, I'm so sorry. And so pious, so sanctimonious. Where's your Bible now, Pastor? About goodness and innocence and trust. Oh, please, you can't say anything to me that I haven't already said to myself. How did this happen? I don't know how this happened. It's as much my fault as it is his. If you're going to shoot, then shoot both of us. Yes, don't worry about that, madam. You'll pay. Stoning is what you deserve. Both of you. The whole town ought to know about this. The whole town shall know... No, Mervin. No, no, darling. What about Philip? Philip! You talk to me of Philip. Please, we've admitted our guilt. We'll do anything. Yes, anything. Shut your mouth, sir! If for one second, you believe that there is anything more important to me than honor... No, no, of course not. I didn't mean that at all, but... But to scar your son like this. He's right. Why should you want to punish Philip? Please, let me try to make this up to you somehow. Let me... Let me give you something. Something for Philip's sake. I don't have very much, but... Well, I don't know. Perhaps some kind of security for his future. The deed. The what? I want the deed to this house. That would be something permanent for him. That's scandalous. Scandalous? You talk to me of scandal? I'll show you scandal, sir. No, wait. The house is yours. Nothing more boorish than a sour Scotsman, and the train would be an hour late. Well, he's gone. That's the main thing. Oliver? Are you ill? Think of it this way. A countryside without Finlay Perkin in it is bound to be a sunnier place. He wasn't such a bad sort. He was impossible. We're well rid of him. You would have preferred me to fight him, wouldn't you? Darling, what about Australia? What about Australia? Well, it's a big, new country. It must have big, new opportunities there. We should take advantage of them. We could. Land would be cheap, don't you think? Let's go there. Now, this instant? No. But can't we talk about it? Yes. We'll talk. I'll be in soon. I have to go and see John for a moment. Well, go on. Run along. There's a good girl. It is exciting though, isn't it? Australia? Most exciting. I don't know, Jim. The whole spread just smells sweeter to me with that little pipsqueak off it. Of course, he did have a couple of fair ideas. Yeah, like what? Like cutting the ranch down to a workable size for openers. And he told me we should sell everything north of the Colorado border and east of Line Camp 2. Do you concur on that, John? Oh, howdy, boss. John? Yes, sir, I do. Why? You can't patrol five million acres the way you should. You lose more cattle to wolves and rustlers than you can replace. Anything else? Well, I'd switch to Herefords, Mr. Seccombe. Longhorns are too stringy. And I'd plant an extra 1,000 acres to hay. That's because you're a cattleman, John. And you know what you're about. I'd let the longhorns run the full five million acres till I lost everything. Mr. Seccombe, that ain't true. That's almost why we lost everything this winter, isn't it? No, the fact is that loving the land isn't enough. I run a ranch, but I'm not a rancher. You're the Venneford. Not me. Not Perkin. Certainly not the British investors. But I did do my best. I want you to know that. You began the Venneford, Mr. Seccombe. It was your... I thought of it, John. I thought of it. You began it. You and Jim and the rest of those men that drove the longhorns up here. You began it and you saved it, and the snow came. I watched you both battling that blizzard. You took command. You did the things that cattlemen ought to do. I thought to myself, why can't I do that? Why, what's the matter with me? I wanted to take hold like you did. I wanted to work like you did. I wanted to fight like you did. But I couldn't. I did nothing. Well, some people are created to think up ideas and other people are born to carry 'em out, that's all. Maybe you're right. Anyway, I've decided it's time for a change. I've resigned as General Manager and I recommended to Finlay Perkin that you replace me, John. He agreed. If you think I can handle it, yes. You've handled it for years, John. You can choose your own foreman. Well, I won't have very far to look for him then. Me? Good. Excellent choice. Look, from now on you're gonna have to deal directly with... With Mr. Perkin. Why don't you write him your suggestions? I know he'll accept them. Yes, sir. I will. Good. Well, I'm glad that's settled. I wanted to make sure the ranch was in safe hands. Before what? Are you leaving, Mr. Seccombe? I think it's time. A man needs new challenges, right? New horizons, new opportunities. Anyway, I can't get used to Centennial without old Levi. Did I ever tell you how I met him on the way west? He was with his first wife Elly. She was the soul of the West, that girl. They were on their own. Two children, really, coming across a... No matter. That was another world. Well, where you figurin' on heading then, Mr. Seccombe? Charlotte's talking about Australia. That's a long way. Long way, yeah. Good luck to you both. I think I'll just go and see how the new grass is doing. That? It appears to be. Disgraceful old tub, isn't she? You going to the ports? Oregon. Well met. I'm for Oregon, too. Seccombe. Oliver Seccombe. Boston, London, Oxford. Levi Zendt. Pennsylvania. Delighted, old boy. Delighted. And this is... My wife. How do you do, Mrs. Zendt? Oh, it's Elly, Mr. Seccombe. Elly? Enchanted. I'll go find the Captain. His name is Frake, but you'll not find him aboard. He'll be in the tavern down the way. Heavy drinkers, these riverboat men, but they can navigate narrows you and I couldn't even swim. Elly, let me give you a hand. When Levi's got the wagon aboard, we can all go and see the sights of the town together, hmm? Well, Levi, perhaps we weren't so different after all. We could never leave this place. It's a lovely land. Jim. Skimmerhorn. Howdy, ma'am. Don't go down there. Don't go down there, Mrs. Seccombe. Mrs. Seccombe, please, don't go... Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. These are real fine, fine sugar beets. It's a fine, fine harvest, Mr. Takemoto. Thanks mostly to you and your family. Oh, no. Oh, yeah, yeah. You're the hardest workers I've ever seen. The best. To show you my appreciation, there'll be another bonus. Brumbaugh-san. Bonus nice, but we want... You want your own farm. Well, you're a fine farmer, Mr. Takemoto, but land's pretty hard to come by in Colorado. Oh, Stretzel... Stretzel's farm is up for sale, yes, but it's a lot of money. $3,500. Now, you got $3,500? Have some. You give rest. I give rest? You want me to finance you, so you can leave me in the lurch. Never. You hear me? Never. Never. You're ungrateful. Whoa. Whoa. What do you want? Oh, me? Nothing. Who's ungrateful? They're ungrateful. Why? They quit. Workers all the same. Germans, Indians, Russians. You take 'em in, you treat 'em like family, you give 'em good wages, and as soon as you turn your back, they're off buyin' their own farm. Well, it's not gonna happen again, you hear me? I'm through financing every field hand in Colorado! Anyways, how's everything at the Venneford? Not bad. Got a letter from Mrs. Seccombe. She still in London? Still there, still locking horns with old Finlay. You know, though, I think she's getting a little homesick. She's taking an interest in the ranch again. She made Finlay buy us a bull. A bull? A champion Hereford. As a matter of fact, I'm on my way to collect him right now. Is there anything I can pick up for you in town? No, I gotta go in myself. I got to meet the new minister. Oh, yeah? What ever happened to the old one? He cleared out two months ago. Sickness in the family or something. Look at them. I'll go in with you. I'll get my coat. Never. Never. Brumbaugh-san. What mean "lurch"? Lurch? That's what you're leaving me in. You're supposed to do my spring sowing. How am I supposed to block my beets. Huh? Brumbaugh-san, no, you not... Takeshi! We block the beets, Brumbaugh-san. You block your own beets. Daytime we work here, nighttime our place. What, you do both? Both. Brumbaugh-san, we not leave you in lurch. Brumbaugh-san, you family. Well. Over here on the pad, Mr. Lloyd. You Mervin Wendell's boy? Yes, sir. What's your name? Philip. You come down to see your dad do his job? Yes, sir. Well, he's a real hard worker. Job don't pay much. Only $4 a week. Hardly enough to keep a bird alive. You look like you're eating all right, though. Got some new clothes. Yeah, well, I think someone gave 'em to us. Good talking to you, Phil. Here you are, Mr. Lloyd. My Lord! Look at him. He looks like a king, don't he? He is a king. That's his name. King Bristol. Not bad. Might even tempt a man to give up herding sheep, if he owned an animal like that. Calendar. Hello, Jim. Mr. Brumbaugh. Where in blazes you been keeping yourself? We don't see you around town, anymore. Well, I wasn't sure that you righteous ranchers allowed us sheepmen here in town. We make exceptions now and then. Jim, I want you to meet somebody. This is my son Jake. Jake, this is Jimmy Lloyd. You heard me talk about Jimmy Lloyd and Mr. Brumbaugh. Mr. Lloyd. Hi, Jake. Mr. Brumbaugh. Jake's mother passed on, so he came to work with me on the Garrett's spread. Well, I tell you what, Jake. Minute that smell of sheep gets too much for you, you come on over to the Venneford. We'll give you a real job. Okay, Mr. Lloyd. Don't listen to him, Jake. Say, Jim, I was... I was sorry to hear about Mr. Seccombe. Yeah, right, that was a bad time. How's everything been with you? Couple of nightriders. Nothing we couldn't handle, right, Jake? Yes, sir. Guess you heard the rumor. What rumor? Well, maybe you haven't heard it. They say they're still looking for the three guys that killed Frank and Orvid. Is that a fact? Dumire still looking for 'em, too, or did he give that up? I don't think Dumire ever gives anything up. No, I reckon not. Want me to open up for you, Sheriff? I thought I told you to go on home. I'd rather be here. Go on in there then. You gonna learn how to be a deputy. First thing you gotta learn is to obey orders to your superior officer of the law, see. You gonna enforce the law, then you gotta obey the law. That means doing the right thing. I'll go home. Well, wait a minute. Hold it here, now. I didn't say a deputy couldn't be forgiven for minor infractions. Now, how come you'd rather be here? It's just a better place, I guess. Well, why? You got a good home. Your parents love you, don't they? Yeah. Love 'em back, don't you? Well, sure. Well, what do you mean? They do things you don't approve of? Never mind that. I know what you mean. This place ain't any better. It's just... It's just different, I guess. I used to feel that way. My dad was a sheriff, too, back in Ohio. It was the last thing I wanted to do. You know what I wanted to do when I was your age? I wanted to run off and join the circus. I wanted to be with them circus people. They were really good. I used to dream about that. Taming lions and tigers, flying through the air on a trapeze... Sheriff, telegram for you! Julesburg says we got a killer comin' in on the 3:17. Kinderdine. Ain't he one of the old Pettis gang? Yeah, sure is. Well, what's he coming back here for? You figure he's after somebody? Figure he's after three somebodies, Mr. Timkins. I just don't know what took him so long in getting here. Hey, what's he gonna do? Just stay back. Mr. Kinderdine. Afternoon. Seems that you have the advantage, sir. Have we met? Axel Dumire. You meet every train, Mr. Dumire? There's a murder warrant out on you. What I want you to do is reach over there with your right hand, take a hold of that gun and hand it to me. Or what? Or I'm gonna shoot you in the head, that's what. Now here you are trying to keep everybody from getting excited just seeing a gun. And you expect me to believe that you're willing to take the chance of getting somebody shot. I only hit what I shoot at. Me, too. Maybe we better find a compromise, Mr. Dumire. You gave up your right to compromise when you set foot in my town. Maybe I'm just passin' through. Maybe the Pettis boys paid you to come down here and do a couple killings. Hand over that gun. Sheriff Dumire, there's a situation down here that needs your attention. Get your hands up. Get them hands up high. Turn around. Pick up that other gun, Wendell. Pick up the gun. Move out. Come on, move. Ladies and gentlemen, please! There's no need to be alarmed. Our peace officer has the situation well in hand. It was just a little disturbance. Everything's under control. So there's no need to stand around. Philip, what are you doing here? I was with the Sheriff. Dad, that was a killer. Yes, yes, I know that. You saw how we handled it though, didn't you? No panic, no danger to anyone. The Sheriff and myself out there. The crowd didn't even know what had happened till it was already over. Yeah, well, I gotta go... Philip. Don't trouble your mother with tales now. There's no need to blow everything out of proportion. Is it Charlotte? Yes, my Lord. Good evening, Uncle. Well, I have outlived your father... But not by much. You'll outlive him by a decade. Well, not by another night. Please, sit down. You're a handsome woman, Charlotte. Are you an intelligent one as well? I can generally add two and two, sir, when it's required of me. According to Perkin, you can do a good deal more than that. Uncle, those charges that he brought against my husband... Yes, well, that was in the past. Lord Venneford proposes leaving you his majority shares in the American ranch if you want them. There will be conditions, of course. In the first place, I would expect you to retain this trusty, old Scotsman. He'll make you want to climb the walls, but he'll increase your income a thousand fold. Uncle, I would retain the devil if it would increase my income. I told you she was a canny businesswoman. I believe now that your father and I made a mistake in requiring you to return to England. So the second condition is this, that you return at once to your Red Indians and your woolly cowboys and your uncivilized ways. To Colorado. To your home, and I don't want any argument about this. Uncle. Nor any tears. That's not a condition and you know it. That's the loveliest gift I've ever received. Thank you. Jim! Welcome home, ma'am. Welcome home, welcome home. Oh, here, here! Thank you very much. They're beautiful. John Skimmerhorn, he helped me pick 'em for you. He got throwed a couple of days ago and wasn't quite up to the ride into town. Is he badly hurt? Well, he got a bum leg, but I think it's his pride that's hurting him mostly. Luggage checks, please, madam? Oh, yes. Here. Thank you. Thank you. Well, it's about time you got back here, ma'am. We've been missing you. Oh, Sheriff, wonderful to see you. Who's this? The new deputy? Yes, it's beginning to look like it. Now go back and see if the jail's locked or something, will you? Yes, sir. I'll see you later. Walks just like you, Mr. Dumire. He does? Yeah, that's Philip Wendell. That's Mervin's son. The baggage handler. Actor. Yeah, actor, singer. Talented man. Talented family. They'll make their mark someday. Oh, they've done that already, more than once. Good to have you back, ma'am. Jim, did the bull get here? King Bristol. Oh, yes, ma'am, and I want to tell you, he is a wonder! Real voluntary. You know, he just steps right out there... Well, you know what I mean. Yes, Jim, I know what you mean. Reverend Holly. George. Well, if this don't beat all. You back permanent or just passin' through? Permanent, George. Permanent. That's wonderful. This place sure could use a good pastor. I haven't heard a real sermon since you left. A good pastor. Well, I don't know about good. But the fact is that the church here feels that it needs somebody who really knows the people. And I do know these people as well as any man can. Their strengths and their sins. Well, I'll see you in church, George. Sure, Reverend. Sure will. Yes. Maude! Maude! What is it? Holly's back. Did you hear what I said? Well, what about it? What about it? What's he doing here? Mervin, don't be such an ass. The church still needs a minister. They've re-hired him. That's all. Yes, but... Mervin. No man of the cloth is ever going to admit that he was caught in a married woman's bedroom. Then you feel there's nothing to worry about? Nothing. Maude, I don't know what I'd do without you. Neither do I, Mervin. What do you think you're lookin' at? I was just wonderin'. Wonderin' what? How come your hat's so wide? That's 'cause it's a sheriff's hat. I'm a sheriff, see. I gotta keep the sun out of my eyes so I can see what I'm shootin' at. Reverend Holly. Mr. Dumire, I want a word with you. I got your letter and... Hello, Reverend. Philip. Deputy, you keep an eye on the prisoner there, will you? Yes, sir. Step right this way, Mr. Holly. Right, Sheriff. To tell you the truth, I didn't expect to see you in person. I thought maybe you'd answer my letter with another letter, you see. I wasn't going to answer you at all in the beginning. And then I thought to myself, "No, no, the Wendells have got to be stopped. Somebody has to speak up." I just don't know how you figured it all out. It didn't take much figurin'. In the first place, they're living like kings on $4 a week in tips. And that with you leaving all of a sudden... That didn't make good sense. I couldn't stay. I know, but the point is, why couldn't you? You see, that's the crux of the matter. We gotta make a formal charge. No, no, Mr. Dumire, I won't go into court. Well, Reverend... No, I can't. Please, please understand. Now, I thought that if I came to you like this and if I told you about it in confidence, well, that somehow you'd be able to watch them. To catch them. I mean, if they ever tried to do this thing again... Now, isn't that enough? Won't that serve? Oh, it will help. It'll give me one foot up in the stirrup. But what I got to know is, how did they work it? Well, the woman seemed to like to be close to me. Well, anyway, one night Mr. Wendell said that he was going to Denver. By train. And that Mrs. Wendell would be alone. She was. I kissed her. I took her into the bedroom and Mr. Wendell burst in. And how much did you have to pay him? I gave him my house. But even that wasn't enough. He kept asking for money, for more money. And in the end I left. Judas Priest. Where was the boy all this time? I don't know. I didn't see him. Of course, he must have been in on it. I mean, Philip didn't go to Denver. No, he didn't go to Denver. Maybe that's why he's here now. To keep an eye on you. Philip's an actor, too, you know. That's right, he is. He sure as hell is. What a lovely day! What a lovely country! Jim, do we have to go straight back to the house? I mean, it's so beautiful out here. Oh, you're the boss, boss. Where would you like to go? The prettiest place of all. Line Camp 4. Ma'am, we sold that camp. Of course, if you're not afraid of a little trespassing. What's the penalty? Nothing much. Bucket of tar. A few feathers. I love feathers. Let's risk it. Yes, ma'am. Oops! Jim, isn't this the most beautiful place on earth? It's always been my favorite, too. Ever since I first came up from Texas. Oliver told me you were only 15 years old on that drive. And a half. Ah. Yeah, John Skimmerhorn brought me up here and showed me this spot and told me he wanted me to file on it. Well, I tell you, you never saw anybody more excited than this little kid right then. I mean, I couldn't imagine anything could be better than ownin' a spread like this. Then he explained that I wouldn't own it. I'd just file for a homestead and turn it over to Mr. Seccombe. But I realized I could still have a piece of this range by helping somebody like Mr. Seccombe look after it, and that, that wasn't all half bad neither. You're happy you stayed? Oh, yes, ma'am. You've never been back home? This is the only home a man like me could ever want. Do you know when I first saw this camp? 1881. Lot of changes since then. In all of us. Especially in you, I think. Me? You seemed so young. You've grown a good deal, Jim. I hope so. And Mr. Perkin told me you'd even gone back to school. Well, Miss Keller in town, she pointed me to some good books I'd never known before. Arthur Russel Wallace's Natural Selection and a lot of Mark Twain. And Mr. Perkin says he counts on you as much as on Mr. Skimmerhorn. He's shown me some of your ideas. You have a very strong grasp of economics and some very strong opinions. Too strong, probably. No, no. A foreman ought to be firm. I appreciate that. I need that. As the owner. Yes, well, feathers were one thing, but let's not forget the tar. Shall we go back before we are burned? Yes, ma'am. By the way, I'm dining alone tonight. Would you care to join me? Yeah, I'd be much obliged. Whoa. Howdy, Sheriff. Hello, Mr. Garrett. You know my son, don't you? Sure. How are you, Beeley? Sheriff. I'm glad I ran into you, Sheriff. I was just coming for Mrs. Wendell. I want to invite you to the hotel tonight. It's my wife's birthday. I thought I'd throw her a party. Well, that would be nice. I got to take a prisoner over to Julesburg. Excuse me a minute. Where you been, boy? I thought you drowned in there. Who, me? Where'd you go? I was just in the reeds here. Hey, Beeley. Mr. Garrett. - Philip. - Phil. Pa, can I go in? Without a suit? Phil don't have a suit. Well, hell, go on, go on. Your ma will skin me, but go on. You sure you can't make it back in time, Sheriff? You're gonna miss a whale of a wingding. The Wendells are going to do Whispering Hope. Is that a fact? How about you, boy? You going to perform? For Mrs. Garrett's birthday. Yes, sir. Plan on going up to Denver afterwards? You and your pa? Denver, sir? I don't think so. Good. I'm glad to hear that. Can I give you a lift in to town, Sheriff? You sure can. I appreciate that. Take care now. Let's go, Phil. Wait a minute, Beeley. This ain't a good spot. What do you mean? There are too many rocks, you know? We better go on down a ways. Okay. Dumire is some sheriff, isn't he? I'd sure hate to have him after me. Wouldn't you? I sure would. All right. Now that we got you all heated up, we're gonna let you simmer down a little. My friends, will you please give a warm welcome to three of the most accomplished musicians to ever set foot in Centennial. They're going to do a special request: Whispering Hope. Ladies and gentlemen, the Wendells. Soft as the voice of an angel Breathing a lesson unheard There you are, Mr. Sorenson. If you'll just sign the registry. Thank you. Sam, take Mr. Sorenson's bags to Room 17, please. I'll take that one. Thank you. What's the celebration? Birthday party. Upstairs in the ballroom. It's nice, pretty music. That's the Wendells. They are something to behold. Thank you. O how welcome thy voice Making my heart In its sorrow rejoice Then when the night is upon us Why should the heart sink away? When the dark midnight is over Watch for the breaking of day Whispering hope O how welcome thy voice Making my heart In its sorrow Rejoice Champagne, precious? Yes, in a moment. But not too soon. Oh, I see. Pa, I... Yes, lad, later. Later. But I spoke to Sheriff Dumire and he... Jim. Ma'am, good evening. I'm sorry I'm late. We had a problem down at the barn. Horse with the heaves. I'm so sorry. I do hope he'll be all right. I think so. Well, Jim, you look wonderful. New suit? New everything. Must have tags hanging all over me. I don't see a one. Dinner is served, ma'am. Thank you, Wallace. Shall we? It's the first time I've ever been in this room. No. Really? Well, I hope it won't be the last. Well, tell me all about the ranch. Are we making any money? We'll make plenty this year. Make a lot more if we get the price of feed down. As a matter of fact, I got an idea about that. You see, more and more farmers around here are goin' in for sugar beets. But they throw the tops away. And it seems to me we might buy 'em up for cheap forage. The Herefords love 'em. Jim, what a marvelous thought! It's an old Indian trick. You know, never let anything go to waste. Speaking of Indians, you used to be involved with an Indian girl, didn't you? Part Indian. What was her name? Clemma. Clemma Zendt. Yes. Whatever happened to Clemma? Nobody knows. And you don't care? Well, I suppose I do in a way. Is she the reason you never married? I guess she must be. It's dumb, I know, but I keep thinking she'll turn up again. Well, now, let me guess. Doctor? The black bag. No, I'm just a businessman. Here looking at some properties. I see. Go play with Beeley. Maude, Maude. Yes. Excuse me, sir. I'm terribly sorry. I've just spoken to Higgins. He insists I come to Denver tonight. Tonight? Now, precious, there's nothing I can do. You know that. I've just got time to catch the train. Oh, no. Please forgive me. I'll see you tomorrow. I promise you. This is the end. I mean it. That's the last time that man is going to run out on me. Are you all right? Would you take me home, please? Of course. Thank you. I just feel so ashamed. Surely not for crying. It seems to me you're certainly entitled to a few tears. I mean, but I have no right to put my burdens on your shoulders. I think they're broad enough. Yes, they certainly seem to be... Mr. Sorenson... You're a beautiful woman, Maude. You should never be left alone. I'm not now. Maude, I'm back. I missed the train. Maude... Be still, man, for God's sake. Nothing's happened. Be still? What earthly right have you got to tell me to be still? You wait until my back is turned. You creep into my house! There's no judge or jury who wouldn't honor me for killing you! Sir. The old badger game. I should have known. I must be getting silly in my old age not to see through an act like yours. You're very good. Now we'll see what your sheriff has to say about this. Mervin. Now, sir, just one moment. Put that down, you fool. I've had enough. He's breathing, isn't he? No. Oh, my God, we'll hang. They won't hang us. Nobody knows he's here. We'll bury him. What? We'll put him in the well. That's the first place he'll look. Phil. Dad, I tried to tell you at the party. Sheriff Dumire knows what you did to the minister. So the minute he finds out you were dancing with this man, he's gonna be out here. He's gonna be looking down that well and he's gonna be digging up that cellar. Philip, how did you know about the minister? I guessed. I knew he didn't give us this house for nothing. Oh, dear God, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? What have we done to this poor boy? Mervin, be quiet. He won't collapse. He's his mother's son. Aren't you, dearest? I guess I must be. 'Cause I know where we can hide him. Right here. In the creek? It won't work. Yes, it will. Now, come on. They'll know he didn't drown. Someone's bound to remember he left with me. Look, nobody will ever find him. Here, help me get him in. He's too heavy for you. I can handle him in the water. Things are lighter in water. Philip? Come on. Come on. Come on. Philip, come. Come. Where did you hide him? Cave. Some beavers made it, I guess. It was my secret hiding place. Now, I guess... Now, I guess it's got to be ours, huh? Mother, one thing. We can never tell him, no matter what we do. The Sheriff? No. Father. Mervin? Maude, look. Look. It was in his black bag. It's a fortune. $5500. Do you know what this means? Do you know what this means? It means we can go to Europe. It means we can invest. We can have a business. We can have a theater. No. Maude. Not yet. What are you talking about? Sheriff Dumire. He'd want to know where we got the money from. We're going to be very patient. We're going to quit the badger games. We'll take on extra work. All of us. Even Philip. And then... Yeah. When the time comes, we'll be able to invest our savings. Dumire again. He's always the fly in the ointment. What if he finds the body? He won't. Why not? Where did you hide it? If you don't know, you can't tell. Listen to me, young man. Mervin, shut up! Go, make yourself useful. Go wash the blood off the floor. Well, well, well. Sheriff. Morning, Hans. You're up bright and early this morning. Is this some kind of official visit? Oh, no. I just wanted to talk to you about a couple things. Someone told me you arrested Charley Kinderdine. Yeah. Packed him off to Julesburg. Beats me why a killer like that would ever want to come to Centennial. Ain't that a mystery? Speaking of mysteries, I got another one for you. Manager of the hotel is worried about a guest of his. This fella checked in last night and just plain disappeared. Never slept in his bed. Name of Sorenson. Sorenson? I talked to a man like that over at the land office. When? Yesterday. Late afternoon. He just got off the train. Had his bags with him. He was inquirin' about buyin' some land. I said I didn't have any, that maybe Lucinda Zendt might. I best have a talk with her. She's not home, Sheriff. She went to see her son in Wyoming. She won't be back for another week. All right, Hans. You take care, Axel. I can't meet all the trains. What was that all about? Who's Sorenson? Some man who probably ran away from his wife. Well, I came to tell you I heard from Nacho Gomez. He's thinking about coming back to the States. Now, I could write to him again, tell him to head on up here if you want. He'll be looking for work. Maybe he could bring a whole crew on up with him. Maybe. Tried everything else. Maybe this would work. What's the matter? You ever hear of a man by the name of Kinderdine? Charley Kinderdine? Killer from Kansas? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure. Friend of the Pettis boys. Why? What was he doing here? I don't know. Where is he now? Julesburg. Axel picked him up. Then that's the end of it. Is it? Don't you think so? Well, I think we better keep our eyes open and our guns handy. Might be a time. Meanwhile, I'd be obliged if you'd write this Nacho and tell him that there's plenty of work for as many as he can get. Serafina! Serafina, where is your husband? Don't run like that in these mountains, Uncle. You have a problem with your heart. No, no. The only problems of the heart are caused by beautiful women like you. Now, where is your husband? The cantina. Tranquilino. Nacho. Tranquilino, how would you like to go to the United States? Not today. Oh, sure you do. What are you talking... There's nothing up there we don't got down here. You crazy? There is opportunity. There is wealth. Really? Then how come you left such a paradise? I told you. I came to see my family before I die. I've seen them. Now I want to go back. Go ahead, Nacho, I won't keep you. Come on. Do you know what this is? No. It's a new life. It's from a friend of mine from the state of Colorado. They need farmers there. Good pay, good food, good places to live. I've got good food, a good place to live now. You have nothing. I tell you what you will have is a revolution. Hey. Yes, I know. They've killed all the Indians up in those mines. And now they're working the mestizos to death. How long do you think a human being can stand that? It's not my problem. It will be your problem. Now, cut your finger. Now, you see if the blood does not spread. That is what revolution is. Blood! Nacho. Come with me. Don't let them kill you like a fish in a barrel. Please. Please, Tranquilino. Mr. Dumire? What happened? Nothing. That's the trouble with wearin' one of them badges. Everybody expects a catastrophe every time they see you. How do you know I wasn't just waiting to buy a box of cigars? Were you? Could use some. I'm sorry the store was closed. I've been in Wyoming to see Martin. How is he? Oh, he's fine. He's looking more like his father every day. Lucinda, I want to ask you something. I'm trying to trace down this man. A stranger. Come here about two weeks ago and nobody's heard of him. Name's Sorenson. Remember seeing him? Sorenson. Oh, yes, he was here. He wanted to buy some property. Made a very tempting offer, too, but I didn't want to sell. How tempting was it? Well, he was willing to go as high as $5,500 cash for some good river property. Cash? Yeah, he even had it with him. In a black bag. He even showed it to me. That's a lot of money to be showing around. You bet it is. I told him he should take it straight to the bank. But he said he could handle it. You know, he's from Minnesota. He may have just gone home. Sent a wire to his wife. She ain't heard from him. Oh, dear. Ms. Zendt, could you kinda watch your customers for me and see if anybody's spending more money than usual and let me know? Yes, I will. But if Sorenson was robbed or hurt, would the people who did it to him stay here? They would if they're smart. And I got a hunch they're mighty smart. Well, thank you for your time, ma'am. Good day. Do you want those cigars? I'll come back for 'em. I just got to talk to somebody. Bob. Back again, Mr. Dumire. You ought to take a room here. Save yourself some steps. Listen, I just found out Sorenson had a little black leather bag with him when he come to town. Did he still have it when he checked in? Yeah, I think he might have. Yes, he did. A little one about so big. Looked like a doctor's case. What ever happened to it? I'm blessed if I remember. Let's see, did he give it to the bellboy? No, wait a minute. He wouldn't let anybody else touch that case. Took it right on into the ballroom with him. In the ballroom? Yes, Mrs. Garrett's birthday party. You remember? Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, the Wendells sang for it, didn't they? Oh, my. Yes, they did. That was some affair. Yeah, I am sure. You don't happen to recall who he left the party with, do you? No. No, that was a busy night. Wendells sang all evening, did they? Yes, till about half past nine. Mervin had to leave then. Just him? Yeah. Said he had to take a trip to Denver. Busy man. A real worker. We could use more like him around here. Yeah. Ain't like him to leave the missus alone, though. Suppose she got home all right? Well, I didn't see her then, or later. Of course, I was awful busy. Why? Oh, nothing. Nothing to worry about, Bob. I just wanted to make sure Sorenson had that money with him when he went in the ballroom. Money? It was in the bag. Hey, Phil. Hey, Ma, can I go? Yeah, go ahead. I'll be out in a minute. Okay. You wanna go swimming? No, I can't. I got a job. I'm gonna go over there right now. Where? At the telegraph office. I'll be delivering some wires. Well, now, what's this? What's this? Is this some sort of a mystic powwow? I mean, a sheepman talking to a rancher in broad daylight, in the middle of town. Yeah, I told him he was taking his life in his hands. But he's a stubborn cuss. Well, maybe it's time I got a little stubborn. The world's changing. Centennial's got to change right along with it. Well, it ain't gonna be easy on Centennial. Or you. Yeah, well, I tell you something, Garrett. I just got my nose skinned. I was talking to a couple of the ranchers. I told them maybe it was about time we held out the olive branch. And you know what they said? They said, "To Garrett? "Why, Garrett's got a murderer working for him." I mean, they're bound and determined that Amos Calendar killed the Pettis boys. I can't talk 'em out of that. You know, that's kinda funny. I keep hearing that Amos had a little help. Yeah? Yeah. From a farmer and a rancher. Let's wash the dust out of our mouths. Come on, Garrett, I'll buy you a drink. I've never turned a free drink down yet. Hey, you know who they were talkin' about? The rancher anyway. Jim Lloyd. Oh, yeah. I could never kill a man. Could you, Phil? Phil? Could you ever kill a man? Yeah, yeah. If I had to. I mean, Sheriff Dumire, he has to. He's the best man I ever knew, too. Thank you, Mr. Pierce. Philip! I'll see you. What's wrong, Mom? How is Mr. Dumire been treating you lately? Kinda funny. Yeah, he's been asking a lot of questions. He seems to be asking a lot of questions about us all over town. The butcher just told me Mr. Dumire was only checking our credit. But I think you better stop seeing him for a while. No. No? Because that would just make him more suspicious about us. Or about me anyway. Yeah. All right. You play it any way you want to. But you be careful. You said his name was Sorenson? Yeah, was a big, tall fella about six foot. Forty, maybe 45 years old. As a matter of fact, I did see a stranger at the party. I thought he was a doctor. Why? Bag he carried. A little black bag. Never put it down. Not even while he was dancing. You recall who he was dancing with? I do, indeed. It was Maude Wendell. I remember thinking to myself that that gentleman had better watch his step. Was I right? Have they been trying to blackmail him? Might be a little worse than blackmail this time around, Reverend. Worse? What could be worse? Murder. Murder? See, he told everybody he was out to buy some land. He was walking around with $5500 in cash money in that little black bag of his. Nobody seen him or the bag since that party. Couldn't he have changed his mind about buying here in Centennial? Couldn't he have gone on to Wyoming? Oregon? Not too likely. His wife got one card from him. Said this was the area he decided on. Said he was staying in the Railway Arms till he made his deal. Poor man. Poor, poor man. Yeah. Now, Mervin Wendell left that party at 9:30. Anybody see Sorenson leave? No. Maude? I'm sorry, no. I kept as far away from her as I could that night. But surely if they did leave together, somebody must have seen them. In the lobby, on the street. No, sir, nobody. Nope. Not a soul. They can't get away with a thing like this, can they? No, sir. Not in my town. Them people killed that man, Reverend, and I'm going to prove it. I'm gonna prove it if it takes me the rest of my life. Oh, Jim. Good afternoon, ma'am. Isn't it ever going to be Charlotte? It seems to be a kind of hard word for me to say. Force yourself. Charlotte. There. See how easy? We haven't talked in a long while, have we? No, ma'am. I don't suppose you'd care to dine at the house again tonight. No, ma'am. Why not? Because I'm gonna ask you out tonight. Oh? If you're free. Yes. Yes, I'm free. More wine? Please. You'd think they'd gotten used to us by dessert. Does it bother you? Well, to tell you the truth, I don't know. I guess I can see their point as a ranch foreman having supper with a European heiress. I know how they feel. And how does the foreman feel? The foreman's enjoying himself. So's the heiress. They shouldn't give a hoot about what happens to the rest of the room. Is that it? Not a hoot. Your check, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you. You ready? Want me to open her up for you, Sheriff? Past your bedtime, isn't it? Some. Hey, notice anything new? Where did you get it? Ain't it a dilly? Just like yours. Asked you where you got it. Bought it. Where'd you get the money? Working. Timkins must be paying you pretty good. Oh, he gave me an advance. Got another question for you. What's that? Where were you the night that your dad broke in on the minister and your ma? What are you talking about? I'm talkin' about badger games. I'm talkin' about murder. Murder? The minister? Nah, can't be. I just saw him this afternoon. You see Mr. Sorenson this afternoon, too? Who's Sorenson? Quit it. Now, I know what happened as sure as I'm standin' here, and so do you. She talked him into takin' her home from the party, and when your dad broke in on 'em, I don't know what happened exactly. Maybe a gun went off accidental. But I know he's dead and I know you know he's dead. Where's that body hid? What body? Get outta here! Go on, get out of here and stay out of here. I don't want to see your lyin' face no more.
