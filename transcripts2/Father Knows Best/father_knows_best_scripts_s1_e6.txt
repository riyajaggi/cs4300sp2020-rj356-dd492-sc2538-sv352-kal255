 Robert Young... and Jane Wyatt. With Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray, and Lauren Chapin... Jim! What in the world are you doing? Found them! What are those for? We're playing badminton at the Phillips' tonight. Oh, you better get your gin bloomers. My what? I haven't done this since I won

 all those athletic trophies at college. Athletic trophies. You won a loving cup at a poetry contest, that's all. Well, it was sort of an athletic poem, Margaret. I think it was called "Benny at the Bat" or something. Anyway, they said 8:00. Boy, I'm raring to go! Wham! Dear, are you really serious about this? About what? Well, playing badminton. After all these years? Margaret, you make us sound like a couple of old fuddy duddies.

 Remember, you're only as old as you feel. You're just as young as the day I married you. Nothing. What a shame to waste such talent at badminton. Hey, Dad, can I... Criminy! What's that? What's what? That thing you're wearing. This thing happens to be my alma mater sweater, and I'll thank you to show it a little more respect. Oh, you had to be a great athlete to win one of these letters, Bud. I thought you won it in a poetry contest. If you and Betty want to get to Evelyn Burkett's wedding on time, you better get a move on. Can I borrow your old razor? Yeah, it's in the... My what? A razor, a brush, some shaving cream, aftershave lotion, band-aid. Are you serious? Still think I'm a kid, ay, Dad? Well, I do think you're rushing the season a little bit. Well, I'm going to be an usher tonight, Dad. There's nothing more icky than a fuzz-faced usher. Except maybe a scar-faced one. I've got a steady hand. Look, son, let me give you a tip. Cling to your youth! Time has a habit of moving forward, never backward, never motionless. Stay with it as long as you can, okay? Okay. Now can I? Can you what? Use your razor. It's in the medicine cabinet. Thanks, governor. Oh, Dad? Huh? Is it true you're going to play badminton tonight? Yup! The old athlete relives the triumphs of his youth. Well, take it easy. Remember, you're my only father. Father, if you don't tell that lame-brained son of yours to... What's that? What's what? Well, that! Oh, my alma mater sweater. Well, they told me about it, but I didn't know it looked like that. Like what? Well, like what they wore in the olden times. Betty, that was only 20 years ago. Well, we use the same letters today anyway. Did I tell you how I won this letter? Squash. I thought squash was a vegetable. Ah, they don't play squash the way they used to anymore. They don't do a lot of things the way they used to. They don't give letters for poetry, either. For poetry I got a loving cup. This I got for squash. Now get going, Princess. You and Bud will be late for the wedding. Of course, I'll be late. I can't get into the shower because your son is in the bathroom shaving. Of all the ridiculous things. Your brother's growing up. He's no longer a beardless youth. Oh, Father, I've seen more fuzz on peaches. Betty, this is no joking matter. Time has a habit of... Run along, Princess. He'll be out of there in a jiffy. This house stifles me. When I get married, I'm going to have three bathrooms. Three for just the two of you? Well, there won't always be just two of us, Father. Mother tells me you're going to play badminton. You've got to be kidding. Kidding? I never was more serious in my life. What's wrong with playing badminton? Nothing, Father. But I've grown so fond of you, I wouldn't want anything to happen. Why do they keep saying that? I'm as young as I have a mind to be. If badminton comes, can squash be far behind? I'm the same man I was 20 years ago, only keener, quicker, wiser. Wiser? Then why am I playing badminton at my age? Where did you get that crazy sweater? I didn't hear you come in, Kitten. Does a space helmet go with that? Kathy, you, too? What are you supposed to be, Daddy? A doddering, antiquated shadow of my former self. Huh? Never mind. So you're going over to Patty's house tonight. My little girl is really growing up. I know it. But you're still Daddy's little girl, aren't you? Right now I am. But you know how kids are. They grow like weeds. I know. But remember, no matter how big you are, you'll always be my little girl. Okay. If that's the way you want it. Yeah. That's the way I want it. Jim? Yes, dear? I have a special delivery letter for you. I'll be right down! Jim! What are you trying to do? Funny thing, the old legs aren't what they used to be. I could have told you that. What do you know about old legs? I have a pair of them myself. They cave in on me at the end of a long day. It's from Eddie Gilbert. Eddie Gilbert. I haven't seen old Eddie since high school. I wonder what he's up to these days. Ho ho, what a guy. I remember he had more energy than sense. Oh, he says he's going to be in Springfield tomorrow. He might stop by. Oh, good. He's been having a little bit of trouble with rheumatism lately. I can't imagine anything like that catching up with an active guy like Eddie. Well, of course he's not as young as he used to be. What do you mean, he's no older than I am. In fact, he's a year younger. Younger and rheumatism? Well, that's the way it is when those years start to come up on you. Oh, dear, what a shame. Poor old Eddie. Here we are talking about badminton. Oh, which reminds me, I'm not ready. Margaret, are you sure you feel up to this? Well, yes, I think so. Well, don't you? Well, yes, I... I think so. I'm just thinking about you, dear. Oh, don't worry about me, dear. I'll manage. Oh. Now, a sweater and a skirt should be right, shouldn't it? Don't you want to hear the rest of the letter? All right. It's been a long time since I've seen old Eddie. He's a grandfather. He is? He has three grandchildren. Aw. Why that just can't be! Why not? He once told me he had a daughter a year or two older than Betty. The kids call him Gramps. This I just can't believe. Mother, my zipper's stuck, will you help me? Gramps. Margaret, he's a year younger than I am. I know, you said so dear. Who is, Mother? Oh, an old school chum of your father's. Gramps. There, now let's see how you look. You look lovely, dear. Doesn't she, Jim? What? Where did you get that dress? I'm going to be a bridesmaid at Evelyn's wedding. Why did you ever buy anything as matronly as that? Matronly? It's too old for her. Betty, put something else on. Father. But, Jim, all the bridesmaids are dressed exactly alike. But all the bridesmaids aren't 17. What does that got to do with it? Well, in that dress she could be going to her own wedding. Oh, Jim. Ever since that silly letter arrived... Oh, that has nothing to do with it. Father, Evelyn's one of my best friends. It's an honor to be a bridesmaid. Now don't cry, darling. You're going and in that dress. Put some powder on your nose. You're not the one that's supposed to cry at weddings. Well, and what are you made up for? What? Oh, I'm an usher. You look wonderful, dear. Just fine. Thanks, Mom. What's wrong with the blue suit? Oh, I couldn't wear that. Besides, all the fela's are going to be dressed like this. It's the latest thing in college. College? That's right, you'll be in college in three more years. Two and a half. What's wrong with Dad? Nothing much. Just a slight attack of time. Here, let me fix your tie. I'm ready. What's the matter with Daddy? Daddy's thinking, darling. Father, are you all right? Gramps. Huh? What are you all staring at? I was just about to ask you that question. Oh, creepers, look what time it's getting to be. Ooh, hurry, you'll be late. You gotta drop me off at Patty's house first! Have a wonderful time! Wait! My little brood. My family. It's so nice to see you all leaving together this way. Someday soon you'll be going your separate ways and we'll get together only on important holidays. Margaret, our children are really growing up. Criminy, I should hope so. Father, we're excruciatingly late. Patty's waiting. Run along, children. Bye! Bye. Good-bye! Well. What brought that on? Nothing, I... Well, it isn't easy to watch your children growing up. It isn't easy, but it's nice. It's sad. It is not. Yes, it is. Any day now, Betty will be getting married and flying away. Bud will be married before we know it. He'll fly away. Next Kathy will be flying away. Who's left? Just us old buzzards. Heavens, it's nearly 8:00. I'm not dressed. You're not shaved. What for? Well badminton, remember? Oh, do you think we should at our age? I certainly do. Now come on up and get shaved. Margaret, wait! Jim, it's late. Honey, do I look like a man upon whom time has taken its toll? You look just as young as the man I knew who won a poetry contest 20 years ago. Margaret, I... I have a confession to make. You cheated at the poetry contest? It's just that I wasn't really very good at squash. I knew it. You never fooled me. Maybe you better call the Phillips, tell them something came up, we can't make it. Can't make it? My fire is burning low. Oh, not Jumping Jim, the badminton, boy. I'm a little tired, Margaret, I think I'll go to bed. At 8:00? Oh no, Jim, for heaven's sake. Margaret, would you please get me a hot water bottle? When did you get in? Yesterday. I'm a grandfather, you know? You look it. Guess how old I am. You're a year younger than I. Correct. But you look old enough to be my father. Correct. Pretty warm in here. Ever play squash? Played it and ate it. Never played it, always ate it. Did you like it? Hate it. How's your rheumatism, Eddie? How dare you! No one ever accused me of rheumatism and got away with it. I challenge you. Stop! How dare you take advantage of an old man? He's a year younger than I am! Don't change the subject. How many times have I told you not to play with him? At my age, I can't be choosy. I can beat him at squash too, I bet you. I bet you can't beat him at poetry. Yeah, I challenge you to poetry! Now, Grandfather, I don't want you overexerting yourself. Poetry at your age, gramps? Granddaddy, if you're going to recite poetry, you better have a nap. They're right, Grandpa Jim. Grandpa Jim? He's a year younger than I am. Ha ha! Yeah, but you've got rheumatism! Don't worry, it won't be long and you'll have it, too. I will not! You will so! I will not! You will so! Margaret? You will so. Not if I take good care of myself. I'll keep my feet dry. I'll stay out of drafts, dress warmly. I'll lick this thing, I will! It's inevitable! Old age and rheumatism, they go together like ham and eggs. I won't accept it! I won't! I won't! I'll never grow old. Never! Never! I'll never grow old. Never! Jim, please! Jim, wake up! You should have seen yourself. You called me an old man! Oh, you were dreaming. Now get dressed and we'll have some breakfast. No, Margaret, please. What's the matter? I have to take care of myself. Could I... Could I have breakfast in bed this morning? I think this has gone far enough, Jim. Well, you're beginning to sound a little ridiculous. Please, Margaret. I need all the sympathy you can muster. And to think that only yesterday you were going like a blast furnace. Squash, badminton... That was yesterday, honey. I'm considerably older this morning. It must have been a long night. All right, I'll bring you your breakfast. Father! Look. The bridal bouquet. Where did you get that? Last night. I caught it. You know what that means, don't you? Eh, what? That I'll be the next bride. Betty, you're only 17! Besides, that's a ridiculous superstition. Lots of girls get married at 17. With their parents' consent, of course. Oh, Father, I wish you'd seen it. It was so wonderful. All the flowers and the beautiful dresses. Everybody was so solemn. â™ª Here comes the bride â™ª â™ª Hmm hmm mmm hmm â™ª Betty, stop it! What's going on? Father's sick. It's that badminton. Those games aren't for men your age. I tried to warn you last night. Your father didn't play badminton last night, and your breakfast is on the table. Bud's right, Margaret, a man has to be his age. I have to take care of myself. What did you bring me for breakfast? Mush, milk, and zwieback. Now, you see, children, your father's at that certain age. They either want to burn up the world or to find a nice, warm rock to crawl under. It doesn't take much to push them either way. Your father is obsessed with the ridiculous idea that you're growing up too quickly. This gives him a feeling that he's growing old quickly. We've got to get him out from under that rock. Now, this is my plan. Where are the children? They'll be here. My! And at what mortuary are you applying today? A man reaches my age, he can't dress like a schoolboy. I can't recall you ever dressed like a schoolboy. I did though, when I went to school. Those were the days. Those wonderful, carefree, youthful days. Oh, come on, dear, smile. No sir, Margaret, I've come to the realization at last, it's the kids growing up that makes you feel old. Oh, nonsense. Margaret, don't be blind to the truth. Your son shaved last night. But that doesn't make me Whistler's mother! Betty went to a wedding. Soon, too soon, she'll be going to her own! Perhaps that's a wishful thought on your part, Jim. Aw. I'd want Betty with me forever. Kathy, overnight at a friend's house. That's the first time she's slept in a bed other than her own. Margaret, that's growing up. Oh, I don't know. Poor, poor, innocent Margaret. My child wife. That's all. Calling KX2J3! Calling KX2J3, over! Hello! KX2J3, reporting, Captain Sonar, over! This is Captain Sonar, I can't see... Wait, Bud, let me see your space helmet. Don't take it off, I'll lose all my oxygen pressure. Aw, Bud, let her have it. She'll get it stuck on her big, fat, old head! I will not! Don't be such a stingy face! It's my space helmet! I'm not going to hurt it! You will too! Quit pulling! You'll break my arm! I'm not even touching him. All right, kids! Break it up and come to the table! Help! Help! They're after me! Oh, Kathy! If I get my hands on you! Wait a minute! What's going on here! Wait! Stop! Bud! Yes, sir? I was just telling your mother how proud I was of the way you were growing up into such well-mannered ladies and gentlemen. Now you come tearing into this room like a bunch of wild... Comanches? Comanches! Margaret, what's gotten into them? They act like 2-year-olds! That's children for you. They never grow up. Oh, it's probably for me... Joe. I'll get it. It's probably Ralph. I'll get it! Don't be too hard on them, Jim. I think you expect too much of them. After all, dear, they're only children. Margaret! I think I'll have some lunch. Any steaks in the freezer? Mmm-hmm. How many do you want? Oh, two or three. Even four, if you wish. It's for you, Father. Thank you, Princess! How about a mess of French fries, too! Hiya, son! Nice work, kids. Hello. Eddie! Eddie Gilbert! Sure! Got your letter yesterday! How are you feeling? Good, good. Sure, we're gonna be home. We'll be glad to see you. Where are you now? Well, you're just a couple of minutes from here. I'll tell you what, I'll pick you up, old fellow. Are you sure you can make it? Fine. We'll see you in a little while. Oh, and, uh, don't rush now. Sure. Good-bye. Poor old codger. Who was it, dear? That was old Eddie Gilbert. He'll be here in a minute. I hope you asked him to stay for lunch. Who's Eddie Gilbert? He's an old school chum of mine, Princess. I haven't seen him in years. He's a grandfather now. He used to be such a life-of-the-party, too, the poor fellow. I guess he wasn't fortunate enough to have such young children as I have. What do you mean, dear? Well, you know, his children have grown up, flown away, just he and his wife left alone. Maybe that's why he's turned into an old man before his time. Nothing left to live for. Well, maybe he's like you, dear. Old one day, young the next. When your children are grown, that's the end of the line. I could tell from the tone of Eddie's letter. Rheumatism, you know, hardening of the arteries. Oh, there he is. Come on, honey, we'll meet him together. The poor devil. He was always such a youthful, bubbling sort of a guy. Anderson? Uh-huh. I'm Gilbert. Not Eddie Gilbert. Sure. Don't you remember me, Jim? You used to call me Crazy Eddie! Ed, but... I... I mean, where's the... You haven't changed! Neither have you. You look just like you did when you won the poetry contest. I... I can't believe it. Eddie! Jim. Excuse me. I'm Margaret Anderson, Mr. Gilbert. How do you do? Delighted to meet you. Margaret, this is Eddie! Yes, dear. Won't you come in? Thank you. Here, here, give me your coat, Eddie. Oh, thanks. Gee, you look great, Jim! So do you! I... I can't believe it. Can you, Margaret? Believe what, dear? Well, from the letter, you know, I... I thought you'd be older-looking, Eddie. Why? Because I'm a grandfather? Shall we go in? Well, I thought... I don't feel like a grandfather, Jim. Oh, I did have a touch of rheumatism once, but that's when Gladys and I went ice skating. I fell through the ice and got wet. What do you do to keep looking so fit, Jim? Well, we play badminton, and uh... Don't we, Margaret? Oh, yes, Jim's an excellent badminton player. He didn't play squash too well, I remember. Ho ho ho ho ho ho! No, I never was very good at that. Tell me, Eddie, what do you do now that the children are grown and married? What do we do? We're livin', man. Gladys and I are doing all the things we couldn't do before. We told the kids, "Now look, "we love you both very much. "We'll always be around when you need us, but we're not going to be babysitters." We're free, man! We're having the time of our lives. You see that, Margaret? That's what I've been telling you. Margaret always worried what she'd do when Betty went off and got married. You see, honey, you'll be free! Doesn't mean you're old if you're a grandma. You're only as old as you feel, I always say. Of course! You're never old while the heart is young, I always say. And I always say, what a difference a day makes. Jim! Are you ready? Be right there, honey! Where are you going, Mother? Well, your father and I are going over to the Phillips' for a little while. Look out below! Oh, Jim, be careful! You'll hurt yourself. Me? Anderson the Ox? What's in the suitcase, Father? Nothing. You ready, dear? What's in the suitcase, Dad? What's in the suitcase, Daddy? You'd better tell them. That's our equipment. We're going over to the Phillips for badminton, then we're going horseback riding, after that, a little skiing, and if your mother feels up to it... Oh, stop. Good night, children. Come on, girlie. Let's go, kiddo.
