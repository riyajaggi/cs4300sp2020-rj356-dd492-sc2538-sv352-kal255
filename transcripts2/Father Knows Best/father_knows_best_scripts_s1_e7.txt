 Robert Young... and Jane Wyatt. With Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray and Lauren Chapin... Now hear this. Now hear this. Load rocket ship for takeoff. Roger? Roger. Switch on, switch on. Roger! Hold it, Roger. Switch off. Huh? I thought I told you to stay away from that machine.

 Oh, gee, Mommy, I was just washing out a few things. Well, you're going to wash us right out of clothes. Now, from now on, you Rocket Men consider yourselves grounded. Oh, gee, Mommy. Margaret? Those are orders. Coming, dear! Margaret, how come I can only find one of my new golf socks? Well, I don't know, dear. Did you look in the, uh... Oh, wait a minute. If it's what I think it is, you better find another pair. Well, you'd feel awfully uncomfortable wearing a wet sock. Oh, no. Not that flying machine again. She hasn't let it cool off since it was delivered. I'll be glad when the newness wears off. So will I.

 A man has to dress awful fast around here if he wants to go out fully clothed. Mother? Mother, will you be a lamb and fix the collar on this for me? I've got to have it right away. Right away? Well, sure. Don't you remember? It's Girls Week. What's Girls Week? Oh, Father. Anyone knows that. It's like Boys Week, only girls! That sounds logical. We take over the city government for one day. Uh-oh. I'm the street commissioner. I never thought I'd raise my daughter to be a street commissioner. Is this what street commissioners are wearing these days? After all, Mother, I'm not going to sweep the streets. Please hurry. My official escort'll be here any minute! Honey, the "street commissioner" wants you. It seems a crisis has developed in the Department of Snagged Stockings. Oh, dear! I'll be happen when the street commissioner is thrown out of office. Be home early, dear. I'll try. Bye, dear. Wait, Dad, wait. The paint's not dry yet. Well, I can't drive around town with that thing on there. What is all this nonsense? Well, it's part of a plan to save you $29.95. I'll bet. Come on, give me a hand. Remember that collapsible canoe I wanted you to buy me? Bud, I haven't time to go through all that again. Well, I finally decided against it. So you're saving the $29 it would have cost you. Good. Now all you have to do is take $5.00 out of the $29 that you're saving and rent a trailer and help us get the raft over to the river. What raft? The one me and Claude Messner are building. See it over there? That's a raft? Well, we got to tie it together yet. Yes, it's a little on the, uh, loose side, you might say. Yeah. Boy, it's gonna be real keen when we get her done. We're gonna take a long trip down Big Stony River. Explore some islands, ride the rapids... They might even write us up in the paper. We might write a book on it ourselves. Then they make a picture out of it. Claude's got the title finished already: Mark Twain Rides Again. Claude says, just 'cause we made one hit picture, that doesn't mean we're great actors. We're keeping our feet on the ground about this thing. Yes, I-I could see that. So how about it, Dad? They got good trailers to rent over at... Look, Son, I don't think that it's safe for you boys to take that raft out on a river. Well, sure it's safe, Dad. Those oil drums will keep us afloat in a storm or anything. And besides, even if we do sink, I've got a waterproof sack for our food. Yeah, but it's a little hard to eat underwater. Wait, Dad. What is it? What happened? Why, you... You little... Fiend? Oh! That scream sure had me scared. Yeah, we thought it was something important. Important? What do you call this? My whole political career is ruined! Mother, if you don't do something about this... This child... Now, calm down, Betty, dear. I'll take care of Kathy. Now, you've got lots of nice things you can wear. Not like this one. Now Janie Little will look better than I, and she's only the... sewer commissioner. Well, what about that new, blue suit of yours? You look very nice in that. That rag? That rag cost a considerable hunk of change. It's very cute. And besides, I think that a blue suit would be most appropriate. Mother, have you ever been in politics? Well, no, but... All right then. Don't make outlandish suggestions about something you know nothing about. Blue suits. I don't think that's such an outlandish suggestion. I was down in city hall last week, and saw several of the commissioners wearing blue suits. They look rather nice. Father, you don't understand! This is very important! If I was just a city clerk or something like that, it'd be different. If you were a city clerk, you could wear my green eyeshade. Hey, maybe you could get transferred. Oh, keep quiet! A lot of cooperation I get around here. Oh, boy! It needs washing again. Oh, no you don't, young lady. You've done quite enough washing for one day. Honey, I'm late now. I've got to run. Bye. I think maybe now is a good time to look in the wash and see what other little surprises you have in there. Mommy, I promised to help Patty with her washing. Not in this machine, you don't. Bud, please, I... But Dad, if I don't get the raft to the river, it's no good... I can't sail it in the back yard. Well, maybe we'll have a heavy rain. Well, that wouldn't be enough water, and all that stuff'll just go to waste. Do you want to encourage your son to be wasteful? Certainly not, but they're waiting for me at the country club. Think of the investment we've got in those oil drums. All right. How much did they cost you? Mmm, got 'em for nothing. That's about what I figured. But you got to figure out what our time is worth. All right. You figure it out and tell me what it comes to tonight. But Dad... Kathy! Kathy, Kathy. What now? Oh, the mail. What? My gosh. Why would anybody want to wash the mail? Honey, this is my bank statement. And all my canceled checks. Maybe you could iron 'em. Claude Messner irons his dollar bills. Says he hates to carry around wrinkled money. I don't know how she got ahold of them. I put them in my apron pocket when I... My apron's gone. Dad, about renting that trailer... Don't bother me now, Bud. This looks like the bill for the washing machine. I don't know whether to pay it, or sue them for damages. Here, this is for you, near as I can make out. For me? Well, who's it from? You'll probably never know. Well, here's a "sensational, once-in-a-lifetime bargain." But I can't make out what it is. Jumpin' catfish! It's from the police department, and for me! What? Police? What do they want? It says I'm supposed to appear there within 7 days. Well, wh-what for? I can't tell. The rest of it's been washed away. Let me see that. "Report at this police station seven days from date..." I can't make out the rest of it. Only 7 days. Well, at least they were nice enough to give you notice before sending you to Alcatraz for life. Jail. Jumpin' hooligans! They'll never take me. Bud, come back. It won't do any good to hide in the basement. I've got to. I'm a fugitive. Stall 'em off as long as you can, Dad! Bud, you can tell me the truth. I'm trying to help you. Now, think hard. What did you do? The police wouldn't send you this thing for nothing. Gee, Dad, I can't think of any crimes I've committed... lately. The only thing to do is go down to the police department and find out what this is all about. Come on. Wait, Dad! Are you ready to talk now? About what? Bud, I can't help you if you don't confide in me. Now what did you do? Break a window? No. Steal some apples? No. Sneak into the ballgame? Of course not. Besides, they boarded up that hole. Well, come on. Let's get going down to the station house. But Dad, I haven't done anything. Honest. In that case, you have nothing to fear. Now remember, the police are your friends. Their job is to protect the innocent, to help people. Gee, I remember when I was a kid. The cop in our neighborhood was our best friend. Whenever we had a problem, he was the fellow we went to. And you can do the same thing. Now come on. The sheriff was our pal, too. He used to take us camping. The sheriff? Mm-hmm. Really? Wild Bill Hickok? Just how old do you think I am? We're, uh, going to the police station. Oh. Um, Bud, you... You better go change your clothes, there's... There's no point in going up there looking like a criminal. Hey, I'll bet I know. Yeah? No. Couldn't have been that. They were all rusty. What are you talking about? Those oil drums for our raft. Oh? Where did you get them? But they were all rusty. I know that, but where did you get them? Well, we sort of picked them up in an alley... in back of Old Man Trumble's place. Oh, Trumble's place, huh? But I'm sure he threw them away. That's not for you to decide. You should have asked him. Chances are, he might have given them to you. But as it is, well, you might as well face it: it's stealing. Oh, Jim. I can't believe that a grown man would make this much fuss over some rusty old oil cans. You don't know Trumble. He's ingrown. Remember all that trouble Ed Davis had with him over the property line? Well, that might have been Ed's fault, you know. Oh, no. Trumble's just that kind of a fellow. I sent him a detailed fire insurance plan for his warehouses, and he didn't even have the courtesy to acknowledge it. Oh, they're closing in on me! Whoa, it isn't gonna do any good to run down to the basement. I'll get it! Hello? Yes. Just a minute. It's Claude Messner. Have they got him, too? He wants to know if he should come over and work on the raft. Uh, tell him Bud'll call him back later. He'll call you later. How much later? I guess that will depend on long a sentence he gets. Didn't you hear? He got arrested for stealing oil cans. Kathy, hang up. Okay, I'll tell him. Bye. He said he would send you a postcard as soon as he gets your cell number. I'm surprised Trumble didn't report Claude, too. Wasn't he in on this deal with you? Yeah. But I was the one who actually took the drums. See, I volunteered. Oh, you did, huh? Well, first we matched. I lost. Then I volunteered. That was a brilliant maneuver. Well, you see, I... Oh, my goodness! They're here already. Yipes! Oh, Bud, don't go down to the basement again. Stall 'em off, Dad. Let him go. I want to find out just how serious this is. I've got to get ahold of Trumble. He's gone too far this time. How do you do? Mr. Anderson? Yes. You have a youngster named, uh... Bud. Says Betty here. Betty? She involved, too? She's the new street commissioner. I'm supposed to escort her to the city hall. Oh, yes, yes. Come right in, won't you? Oh, yes. I'll call her for you. All right. Uh, Betty! Your escort's here! I'll be down in a minute! She'll be ready in a minute. Won't you sit down? Much obliged. Will you excuse us, sir? Yeah. Girls Week. Well, why didn't you ask him about Bud's case? Oh, he wouldn't know anything about that. Besides, I don't want to give anyone the wrong idea I'm looking for special favors. Trumble's the one I want to talk to. We've got to get him to drop these charges. Shall I call Bud? No, not yet. If Trumble is in, I'm going to take Bud down there and have him admit he took the oil drums and apologize. Oh, that's going to be very difficult for him to do. I know it. I know it. I'd hate to have to do it. As a matter of fact, I hate to go to his office myself, after the way he ignored me on that insurance deal. But if we let Bud slide through this, it'll weaken him. These are things that build a boy's character. Dad? Dad? Is the coast clear? Are the cops gone? Hello, Claude? Hey, kid. The heat's on. Can I bunk with you till this blows over? No. I think they're out in back, searching... So long, Claude. Yipes! Hurry up, Bud. I told Mr. Trumble we'd be right down. Yeah, okay, Dad. Nobody's here, Dad. Let's go. Come back. He's here, don't worry. Oh. I called a little while ago. I'm Mr. Ander... Yes. Mr. Anderson. Yes. Mr. Trumble is expecting you. Just be seated. I'll tell Mr. Trumble you're here. Golly, Dad. She scares me. She looks just like... He's talking to Pittsburgh. You'll have to wait. Uh, nice weather. I don't care for it. Too humid. Dad. Now, don't worry, Bud. Just remember, I'm on your side. Tell me again what to say. Well, just tell him the truth. Tell him you were wrong, and then leave it up to me. I think he's deliberately making us wait. Then let's go! No, no, no. What uh... What day did this happen? Do you remember? Oh, sure. It was the same day I got my bicycle license. Claude and I were just coming back... Well, what day was it? I don't remember. Oh, fine. Wait, the date would be on my license slip. I've got that right here in my wallet. Hey, my wallet's gone. I better go home and get it. No, you don't! Ow! Mr. Trumble will see you now. Just a moment, sonny. Not you. He's with me. Well, Mr. Anderson. Mr. Trumble... uh, this is my son, uh, Bud... as you undoubtedly know. Yes, yes. Won't you be seated? Nice weather we're having. A little too humid for me. Yes. So this is your boy? Following in Dad's footsteps, eh? Mr. Anderson, I know it took a lot of courage for you to come down here today. Well, I uh... A lot of courage. Probably you think that my methods are a little drastic, but they're not without purpose. I ignored you deliberately, and waited to see whether you had the drive to follow through, because that's just the kind of man I want to do business with. Wait, Mr. Trumble. What are you... Now, this insurance program you've drawn up... And don't think I haven't gone into it very carefully... In general, it's top-drawer. But there are a few changes. I've made a few notes there. I think they're self-explanatory. Work this over with those in mind, and I think you and I can do business. Dad, what about... Bud, come on. Let's not take up any more of Mr. Trumble's time. But what about the oil drums? Oil drums? By George, I wish you'd asked me a couple of weeks ago. I had a couple of rusty old drums, but I set them out for the trash man. And that's all there was to it. Before we left, I had Trumble eating out of my hand. Well, that's wonderful, dear... Yeah, we sure handled him. It's like I always say, Margaret. The only way to solve a problem is to face it squarely and directly. Well, that's fine. The only trouble in this case is, the problem isn't solved yet. We still have this. Huh? Bud's letter from the police. Oh, my gosh! I forgot all about that! Now listen to me, Bud... I don't know, I tell you. I don't know. Come on in. Yipes! Mother, I had the "darlingest" day. I think politics are so cute. And Sergeant Rice has been so sweet. Is that the one? Yes, Sergeant. Bud, I had the sergeant check into that police letter of yours. Oh, here it is. Next time you go down to the police station to get your bicycle license, don't leave your wallet lying around. Oh, by the way, Mr. Anderson. I have a message for you from the chief of police. For me? Yeah. Wants to see you in his office, first thing Monday morning. So long, Princess. Bye. Hey, Dad. Hurry. I'll stall 'em off as long as I can. Mmm! Jim, what's the matter? Why would the police want me? I haven't done anything, I tell you, I haven't done anything. Oh, darling. Are you still worrying about that? Well, it's the uncertainty, the not knowing. Have you driven through a red light recently? No. Ignored a parking ticket? No. Stolen any oil drums? No. Besides, they were put out in the alley for the trash man. Oh, what am I saying? Oh, darling, you're hardly the criminal type. You've done nothing, so you've got nothing to fear from the police. They're your friends, remember? So forget it and go to sleep. Yeah, you're right. It was kind of silly of me. Probably just want me on some kind of a committee or something. I'm sure of it. Good night, dear. Good night, honey. Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services, Inc.
