 Father Knows Best (1954–1960): Season 1, Episode 10 - Typical Father - full transcript 
 Jim is obsessed with the idea that his 17-year old daughter might elope, since he has read about two such happenings in the paper. Betty has become entranced by her co-star in the school play, Armand, and Jim insists on Betty inviting him to the house for an evening. Betty agrees and although Margaret is impressed with Armand, Jim is still skeptical. Margaret forces Jim, Bud and Kathy to spend the evening in the kitchen, painting, but all of them contrive to spy on Betty and Armand, who are rehearsing the play, which has an elopement as part of the plot. When Betty gets a road map and a suitcase for props for the play, Jim jumps to the wrong conclusion and follows Armand's jalopy when he leaves to the Justice of the Peace, where he and Margaret find Armand acting as a witness as his father officiates at a wedding. Embarrassed, Jim and Margaret return home to be confronted by Betty, and as they try to hide the purpose of their outing, Betty tells them Armand has called to say Jim left his paint brush behind in his rush to leave.

 Robert Young... and Jane Wyatt. With Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray, and Lauren Chapin... Margaret, do you know it's after 8:30? Is it? Why isn't Betty home? Oh, she's probably rehearsing late at school. It's your turn, dear. Well, she ought to be home. When I was her age... Yes, Jim? Well, that's different. She's a girl.

 I'm, uh, 50 points ahead of you. I'm always getting stuck with a Z. Who's bringing her home? One of the girls, I suppose. Suppose it's one of the boys. Well, suppose it is. She's been out with boys before. Yes, but she's never been 17 before. What's being 17 got to do with it? Everything. It's a dangerous age, Margaret. Whenever I read anything in the papers lately, it seems to concern someone who's 17. Jim, for a man who always brags that he's not a typical father, you...

 Now, Margaret, that's one thing you can't accuse me of. I think I've always maintained an open attitude toward the children. I've never tried to influence or shape their lives in any way. I was merely... Betty, is that you? I'm Bud. Remember me? Oh. Hello, son. Hi, Mom. Getting beat at Scrabble again, Dad? I'm just not concentrating, that's all. Hungry? No. But I think I ought to eat anyway. Maybe I ought to drive over to the school and pick up Betty. Darling, what is the matter with you tonight? Nothing's the matter with me. I just asked a simple question: Why isn't my daughter home? I'm home, Daddy. Well, at least one of my daughters is. Ready for bed, Kathy? Uh-huh. Well, I'll go up and turn down your bed. Hmm, stuck with the Z again. Yeah, looks like it. You could use it. Z-A-I-N. That's a word? Patty Davis' father said so. Are you sure? A dark-colored horse with spots. Well, thanks. That's okay. Here. Huh? Oh, uh... Good night, honey. Good night, Daddy. Don't forget to say your prayers. I'll say them twice. I forgot them last night. Oh, Bud, uh, you haven't seen Betty, have you? Betty who? Your sister. Oh, I saw her. She's outside on the porch. What's she doing outside? Saying good night to Armand. Armand? Who's Armand? The guy she's saying good night to. I'm able to figure that out for myself, Bud. Thank you very much. Armand's our leading man in the school play. Oh. I wish he'd lead her in here. Oh, Jim, quit fussing. "Zain"? What kind of word is that? Oh, uh... Dark-colored horse with spots. Is it? How long does it take them to say good night? As I remembered, it used to take you quite a while. That's just what's worrying me. Jim, why are you so concerned about Betty? Margaret, evidently you don't read the newspapers. Look. "17-year-old Girl Elopes With Fellow Student." They turn up in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Isn't that terrible? What's wrong with Altoona? Oh, nothing's wrong with Altoona. But there's something very wrong with youngsters running away to get married. I know a kid. His name's Claude Messner. He's from Altoona. Do you know the porch light's off? I've been asking you for a month to put in a new bulb. I'll certainly fix that tomorrow. Was this kid that eloped any relation to Claude Messner? Mm, no. His name was, uh... Guzman. And her name was... What difference does it make what her name is? The point is, she's 17 and she's eloping! Jim, I'm reasonably certain that Betty's not planning on eloping tonight, or any other night. We have a very sensible and dependable daughter, and you know it. You're right, Margaret. I'm a little upset. Betty's far too intelligent to fall in love with some slick-haired lounge lizard. She's too level-headed. She's... Good night, Father. Good night, Mother. Good night, brother. Altoona. That's the place they make locomotives. What would you have said if my father had done this to you? Your father had the biggest and brightest porch light in town, and you know it. He could have used it for an airport beacon. I can't recall one airplane landing there. I'll never understand why. Breakfast is ready. I'll be in in a minute, honey. Uh-uh-uh! Drink your orange juice first, Kathy. Aw... Morning, Kitten! Morning, Daddy! Hi, Bud. Hi, Dad. Oh. Where's Camille? Isn't she up yet? The beauty parlor, having her hair fixed. Before breakfast? You should see her before breakfast! Since when has Betty been going to beauty parlors? She has a very special date tonight. With Armand! Again, tonight? Dad, did you fix the porch light? Yes, I fixed it. Wait till we get the light bill next month. Wait till you wake up some morning and find your daughter has eloped. Jim, you've magnified the situation out of all proportion. I know. It always happens to somebody else's daughter. Never your own. Well, you read one little article about a young couple eloping, and you think everybody's eloping. Margaret, there's a regular epidemic. Here's another example. Here. "17-Year-Old Babysitter Elopes With Total Stranger." They took her family car and drove across the state line. Not only that, they took $200 her grandmother had been saving up for a television set! What size screen? I don't know what size screen. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Princess. Here's your change, Mother. Thanks, dear. You have some breakfast? I'm not hungry. Not hungry? Oh, besides, I haven't time. I have a play rehearsal this morning. Uh... Betty. Would you like to have me drive you over to school? No, thank you, Father. Armand's picking me up in a few minutes. I'm going upstairs and put on my new sweater. The yellow one! Armand's simply mad about yellow. Loss of appetite. Inability to concentrate. A distinct look of abstraction. They're all recognizable symptoms, Margaret. She getting another cold? No. Unfortunately, it isn't a cold. Betty? Oh! You're just in time. Please help me button this, will you? Sure, Princess. Betty... Does this really look all right on me? I'm just mad about yellow. Sometimes I think it makes me look too young. But you are young, dear. That's what I want to... But I'm 17! I'm practically ancient! I, uh... want to know more about this boy, Armand. Oh, he's simply wonderful, Father. And so sophisticated! Simply utterly! Besides being simply utterly, who is he? Oh. Well, his name is Armand Bradley. Weight, 165 pounds. Eyes, dark, dreamy brown. Shoulders, broad. Clothes? Tweeds, mostly. And he has a small scar, just under the left temple. Sounds like something right off the bulletin board in the post office. Oh, Father. He should be here any minute. So if you look out the window, you can see him when he drives up. Betty! Oh, Betty! Yes, Father? Oh... I, uh... I wasn't finished talking with you. Oh, I'm sorry, Father. Uh, what else do you know about this Armand, except that he has dark, dreamy eyes, wears tweeds, and is simply utterly? Father! I can't ask him to fill out a questionnaire! Betty, I know you think I'm being nosy, and asking a lot of silly questions. But I'm your father. I'm interested in anyone you're interested in. I know. I understand. Oh, I won't have a chance to find out very much at rehearsal. But tonight when we're together, I'll ask him anything you want to know. I appreciate that. We're going to a dance at Lakeside. Lakeside? That's 30 miles from here! That will give us more time to talk. Oh, is there a chaperone going with you? A chaperone? Oh, really! We're not living in the Dark Ages, you know. You'd have thought so last night! Mother, Father's being impossible! I'm being impossible because I ask a few simple, routine questions about this... Armand. Betty, why don't you ask Armand over for the evening? That way we can all get acquainted. And have everybody sitting around, staring at him? No one will stare at you, dear. I'll make sure of that. What's there to do here? Well, uh, we could... Pop corn, for one thing! Pop corn? Play records? Play records? Or we could get up a rousing game of Hearts. Hearts? Oh, how cornball can you be? I could look back on many happy evenings spent like that. Can't you, Margaret? Uh... yes. But this is the 20th century! Betty, your father has every right to ask you to bring Armand over the evening. It's not an unreasonable request. Maybe if you do that, next time, you can go out with him. Pop corn. Hearts. Play records. There'll never be a next time! That's what we want to find out about him. Oh, Betty. You always brought your boyfriends over to meet us! Why are you so reluctant to have us meet Armand? Because it isn't good strategy to ask him to meet my parents so soon. May I ask why? He might think I'm trying to trap him! Well... aren't you? Janie Little invited Bradford Johnson to her home for dinner on their second date, and she hasn't seen him since. Did they poison him? He was not poisoned. He was frightened! What in heaven's name is that? That is Armand! You and Armand had better plan on spending the evening here, Betty. All right. I'll ask him. But if the same thing happens to me that happened to Janie Little, I shall hold you all personally responsible. Good-bye. I spend 17 patient, conscientious years, raising, educating, and training my daughter so some slick-haired, dreamy-eyed Romeo can run off with her in a cut-down jalopy of questionable descent. I think he's got a hole in his muffler. I'll bet that playboy isn't too happy about spending an evening at home. Quite the contrary. Betty said he seemed very eager when she asked him. Well, sure. Why not? He probably figures on moving in with us. Oh, Jim. Betty has three dates with a boy and you have her married to him. How many dates do you think the babysitter had with a stranger, before they eloped? One. That's all. Just one. How would you like to listen to that every day for the rest of your life? Better than that exaggerated wolf whistle you had in your Model T Ford. That was different. At least that had class. Oh, hello, Armand. Oh, there you are. This porch light is so bright, it sort of blinded me. That's terrible. I can't imagine what Father was thinking of. Gee, you look nice tonight, Betty. Thank you, Armand. That's an awfully pretty dress. I'm glad you like it. It's my favorite! Got an awfully nice home, Betty. Must be awfully nice, living here. It is! Most of the time. Uh... well, Betty! You have company? Yes, Father. This is Armand Bradley. My mother and father. How do you do, Armand? How do you do, Mrs. Anderson? Mr. Anderson. Nice to know you, Armand. Nice to know you, sir! Betty's told me a great deal about you. She has? Yes, sir! Betty told me you liked flowers, so I brought these for you. Oh! How thoughtful of you, Armand. Thank you very much. Uh, well. Won't you come in? A man doesn't have a chance around here. I better start hunting for the corn popper. Well, uh... shall we all sit down? I'm sure you and Armand won't mind if we leave you alone. Margaret! Not at all. Good night, Father! Do you have to leave? Oh, we're not leaving. We'll be in the kitchen, painting. Painting? Bud's already started! Margaret, I... I'd be glad to help, Mr. Anderson. Oh, no, Armand! Father loves to paint. Just make yourselves at home. What a sneaky way to get the kitchen painted. You sure do have a nice family, Betty. Thank you. They're even nicer when you get used to them. Would you like to sit down? Sure. Would you like to play some records? Maybe later. Right now, I'm a little worried about that scene we rehearsed this afternoon. Don't you like the character you're playing? Well, I don't like these old men parts. Miss Humphrey says we have to believe we are the characters we portray. Well, how can I believe I'm 40 when I'm not even 20? Wasn't it sweet of Armand to bring me the flowers? Just like a woman. A bouquet of flowers, and she thinks he's Sir Galahad. You just made up your mind not to like him, that's all. You better lock up the silver. You know, I should be studying my homework. Furthermore, I don't like the way I was pushed out of my own living room! You can start over there. Felt like I was being brushed under the rug. You know, if I flunk, it'll be a reflection on my parents. How old is this boy, anyway? Where does he live? You should have asked him for his driver's license. It's not too late. I'll ask him now! Jim! You know that scene where I'm supposed to elope with you? Well, don't you think an old man's gonna look pretty silly, climbing down a ladder in the middle of the night? I, uh... I thought maybe you might like some, uh... lemonade, or something. Would you, Armand? No, thank you. Eh... grape juice? No, Father. Popcorn! No, Father! Jim! Oh. Excuse me. Mother? Does paint have lead in it? Certainly, it does. Then I better stop. I think I'm getting lead poisoning. Margaret, the boy worries me. He looks like a criminal. Oh, I think he's very nice-looking. His ears are pointed, and his eyes are too close together. Oh, Jim. They are not. Want me to go and check? You stay right where you are. Oh, Mommy, I just remembered. I left my copy book in the living room. I'll get it for you, Kathy! Jim, you stay out of there. Well, how do you expect Kathy to do her homework? I'll get it for you, Kitten! And another thing. I don't think the kind of girl you're supposed to be in the play would just run away like that. You're quiet. Shy. You'd probably be afraid to elope just on a romantic impulse. You're the type who's tied to your mother's apron strings. What is it, Father? Uh... you, uh, all right, Betty? Of course. You looking for something? Uh, Kathy's copy book. It's in the kitchen. Oh. Yeah, I'm close by, you know, Betty. In case you need me for anything. Thank you. Mother, I think I'll allergic to paint! Now what? Look! I'm breaking out all over! That's paint. Margaret. You should hear what they're talking about. Oh, Jim. Eavesdropping at your age. You should be ashamed. What are they talking about? About romantic impulses, and something about Betty being tied to your apron strings. Oh, is that all? Well, isn't that enough? Mommy! I just remembered. I forgot to put my bike away! All right. But hurry. Now. You start painting. Mother? I don't feel too well. It says here on the can not to breathe the fumes. You can always stop breathing. Well, it can be fatal, and I've been breathing them for more than an hour. The fumes are not fatal, and we are going to paint the kitchen. You mean we gotta stay here all evening? Yes. I'm a prisoner of love. Oh, by the way, Betty, I'm supposed to pick up some props for the dress rehearsal tomorrow. Let... uh... Yeah, we need a suitcase and a roadmap. Oh, I can get both of those. Wait a minute. Oh! Excuse me, Father. Just looking for a road map. Oh... I've got it! A road map? Dad, you nearly knocked over the paint! What do they want with a road map? Jim! When are you going to stop acting like a comic-strip father? I may be a comic-strip father, but at least I'm aware of my duties toward my family, and those two bear watching. Mother, you promised to keep Kathy in the kitchen! She's outside with her fiendish little face looking through the window! She is? Oh, she probably just walked past the window. Walked past? She's practically crawling through the screen! I, uh, better go and get Kathy. Move over, Kathy. Don't push. Well, I never realized that painting could be such a project. Mother? Could I get a breath of fresh air? All right, and bring your father back with you. I think my lungs have collapsed. Dad, I thought you came out here to get Kathy. I did. Kathy, come into the house. I can't see. Oh, don't crowd. Well, move over, Kathy. Everybody's pushing me! Gee, Betty! I almost forgot! I promised my Dad I'd be a witness for him tonight! Witness for what? Oh. He's a justice of the peace. I help him out sometimes. Oh. I'll go get the suitcase for you. Jim Anderson. Bud, Kathy, for the last time, go into the house. You should all be ashamed of yourselves. That's what I keep telling them. They're eloping! I knew it! Oh, they are not eloping. They aren't? Then what are they doing with a suitcase and a road map? Well, there's a very easy way to find out. Ask them. That's just what I'm going to do. Oh, boy! Get the shotgun, Daddy! It's locked! It probably locked itself. We've got to stop them! Well, go around by the front door, then! That's right. We'll cut them off. They're making a getaway! Margaret, I'll get the car. I'll go try and catch them. I am not going to try and stop them. All right, but if you find yourself cooking for an extra mouth around here, don't say I didn't warn you! I'll tell you one thing, it's never dull around here. ♪♪ What did I tell you? I now pronounce you man and wife. Well, son, I guess we have another couple to marry tonight. I'm pretty sure they're already married. They're Betty's parents. Excuse me, Dad. Hello. Where's Betty? She's home, I guess. Well, what are you doing here? I live here. What are you doing here? Oh, we just happened to be out for a drive and... and... And thought we'd stop in and say hello. But we can't stay. You feel all right, Mr. Anderson? He's just suffering from a case of jumping conclusions. And you and Betty weren't running away to get married? Married? At my age? Well, what about the suitcase and the road map? Well, those are props we're using for the play we're rehearsing. Oh, I see. You don't have to worry, Mr. Anderson. I'd never elope with your daughter. You wouldn't? No, sir. Not without asking you first. Where in the world have you been? For a ride. For a walk. Which is it? For a ride. For a walk. You're acting very strange. Everybody is. Where's Bud? Oh, he said something about being asphyxiated. Where's Kathy? Oh, she went upstairs to bed. She said she was planning on asking for an increase in her allowance. Oh, and by the way, Armand just called. He said to tell you that you left your paintbrush. Oh. What were you doing at the Bradleys'? Well, uh, Betty, you see, your father, being a father, feels a great responsibility for you. You understand, don't you, Betty? He wants to protect you. I'm very fond of you, dear. Jim! The porch light! Just answer one question. What were you doing at the Bradleys'? You know the answer, don't you, dear? I know. Let's face it, Betty. You have a typical father. You know, I wouldn't want it any other way. Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services, Inc. Burbank, CA OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
