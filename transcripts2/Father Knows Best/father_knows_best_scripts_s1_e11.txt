 Robert Young... and Jane Wyatt. With Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray, and Lauren Chapin in... Dancing lessons? Really? How did you ever get Ed to agree to take dancing lessons? Oh, he loves it, he loves it. You should see him doing the mamba. He looks like an agitated ox. But I tell you,

 he thinks he's Fred Astaire. I think that's just wonderful. Actually, it's more fun, really, and I feel ten years younger. I... Why don't you and Jim go along with us tonight? Oh, no. I don't think we can. Why not? Now, how often do you go to a dance? Well, we, uh... Practically never. Why? Well, because... "Because of the children, because of the house, because of this, because of that." Honey, you're in the same boat I was. The same boat.

 I said to myself, "Myrtle... "you're in a rut. "Life is oozing by... "and suddenly you'll be an old woman, and you'll say to yourself, 'What happened?'" There. I think that's enough. Honey, you're not listening. Oh, yes, I am. But you know Jim. I could never talk him into, well, of all things, dancing lessons. Have time for another cup? No, I've gotta run. Listen, darling, you don't talk husbands into things. You put a general's uniform on them, and then you push them along, and they think they're leading the parade. But Jim has such definite ideas about being led into things... about maintaining his, um... masculine independence. Oh, pooh! You should've heard Ed roar when I told him I'd signed up for the course. But now he loves it! Look, I'll call the school and have them sign you and Jim... Oh, no. No, Myrtle, really. Really, I don't think this is for us. Well, suit yourself, but I hate to see you grow old without a struggle. Watch out, Mommy! You better come home now, Patty. In a minute! We gotta play one more game! All right. I'll see you, Margaret. Okay! Ready, Kathy? Let it zing! No, no, Kathy! Don't do that! Why? What's wrong with playing tennis? Well, nothing, except you don't play tennis with a banjo. You've been up in the attic again. Heck. Nobody ever uses it. That's no reason to ruin it. Heck. Come on, Patty. Mother, I'm gonna go over to Janie's for a minute... Well, what's that? Oh... it was your father's at one time. Father played the banjo? Well, I wouldn't say he actually played it. But I remember it sounded pretty thrilling to me when he used to serenade me with it. "Juanita." That was his one song. ♪ ♪ Gee, it must be nice to have funny little things like that to look back on when you get old. Oh, I'll be right back. Now, Bud, don't start eating everything and spoil your dinner. I'm not eating. This is just an appetizer. Not to me. Yeah. Seems like lately I haven't been hungry hardly at all. ♪♪ Hey, Mom, aren't you a little old to be taking up the banjo? What's the matter? Did I say something wrong? Myrtle! Myrtle! Myrtle! Dancing lessons. Really? Oh, I think that's wonderful. I see no reason why parents shouldn't go on living just like anybody else. Well, that's one way of putting it. When did you and Father decide all this? That's the trouble. Your father doesn't know about it yet. He doesn't? No. I'm afraid I let Mrs. Davis talk me into it. I probably shouldn't have done it. I'm... sure Father'll like the idea. Well, according to Mrs. Davis, he'll love it! If I can just think of a way of convincing him he's leading the parade. What? Hmm? Oh, nothing. All I meant was that... Margaret, I'm home! He's going upstairs. Now, when he comes down, just tell him. Make him do it. That's not the way. Well, what do you do, then? Daughter... I'm gonna let you in on a wife's great secret about husbands. Oh? But first, I want you to know that your father's a wonderful father and I couldn't have asked for a better husband. But he's still a male. Well, naturally. And a male likes to feel that he thinks up all the ideas. So the tactful wife, by various, uh... justifiably devious methods plants the idea in his mind and then lets him go ahead and think it up, and everyone's happy. Oh, you mean that... Shh. And he must never suspect. And timing's important, too. You've got to watch for the right moment. Hello, honey. Hello, General. Jim. What's the matter, honey? Anything wrong? No! No, of course not. Are you sure? Certainly. Everything's fine. You know, you have the same look on your face you had the time you told me you were redecorating the living room in chartreuse and black. Hello, Princess. How are you tonight? Oh, I'm... fine! How are you? Tired, real tired. I've been staying up too late. I think I'll go to bed early tonight. 9:00. This is not the moment. Oh. Hello, son. Oh, hi, Dad. What's the joke? Huh? What's the laughing bit for? Oh, I don't know. I was just thinking of the wonderful, devious ways in which women work. Yeah. What's that mean? Bud... this is as good a time as any for you to observe and learn the wonderful workings of the feminine mind. Huh?! You just watch. Something is up. Yeah? Up... Up where? I mean your mother's planning something. I don't know what it is, but the symptoms are there. Women are never so obvious as when they're trying to hide something. Yeah. What's she hiding? We'll soon find out. Now, you watch. The next step is to soften me up by trying to make me comfortable, to get me in a good mood. Then comes the flank attack... little hints thrown out here and there to channel my thinking. Ha ha. They're a strange breed. Yeah, like, for instance, why would Mom want to take up the banjo at her age? What? What's that? What did you say? Yeah, well, this afternoon, I saw her, and she... Shh, shh, shh. Well, what's this? Apple juice, sir, for that tired ache-all-over feeling. Apple juice, that quick energy pick-up for the tired businessman. Try it today. Mm-hmm. Uh... how are the banjo lessons coming, dear? What banjo lessons? Well, Bud said this afternoon... Oh, for heaven's sake. I was just trying to rescue that old one of yours. Kathy found it up in the attic and was using it as a tennis racket. Ohh... Um, dear... speaking of people feeling tired, I read somewhere once that frequently it's caused by boredom. People should take up new things, go different places, try, um, dancing, perhaps. Claude Messner had an unhappy uncle that was 75-years-old, and the doctors told him to take up dancing. There. You see? He tried it and broke a leg. Bud, go in and help Betty set the table. It's not my turn. Go anyway! Okay. You see, dear... It's a funny thing, your mentioning dancing, I heard a good one today on poor Ed Davis. What about poor Ed Davis? Oh, Myrtle's been dragging him off to some dancing school. The way she leads poor Ed around... Oh, I don't see anything so wrong about that. Maybe Ed wanted to go. Oh, no. Even Ed has better sense than that. Might be all right for young sprouts, but a grown businessman, I don't know, it just seems sort of silly. Oh, the children will get it in the kitchen, dear. You know, it seems to me that the old, grown businessman needs it more than the young sprout. It's for you, Dad! Okay! Seems to me if a man had any spunk... Oh, well, Ed has spunk. It's Mr. Davis. Hi, Ed. We were just talking about you. What's on your mind? Well, Myrtle just gave me the good news about tonight, but I'm having a little trouble with my battery, and I wondered if we could go in your car instead of mine. Go where, Ed? Oh, I see. And just when was all of this arranged? Well, I don't know exactly. Um... I was sort of planning to drop out of this thing, but then Myrtle told me you talked Margaret into joining us, so I thought I'd suffer through it for a little while. I see. Well, Ed, it's just possible there might have been a slight misunderstanding about all this, and I'll have to call you back. Yeah. Good-bye. Well, all right, I did it. I thought it'd be fun. I thought it'd be good for us. Well, life is oozing by, and one day, we're going to wake up and say, "What happened?" Well, even the children are making remarks about how ancient we're getting, and... and... well, and they're right, too. Margaret, I have no objection to dancing. In fact, I like to dance... occasionally. But I see no sense in going to school, to be regimented, lined up. After all, I know how to dance, pretty well, too. Oh, sure, the waltz and the two-step, two-step and waltz. Have you ever heard of mamba? Who's he? Who's he?! Well, it's a new dance. Everyone's doing it. I'm not. That's right, everyone except us, that elderly couple in the white frame house on Maple Street. Oh, now, look here, Margaret. Oh, hi, Daddy. Will you play this for me? Oh, I don't think so, Kitten. I'm afraid I'm a little rusty. He certainly is. Oh, come on. Play "Juanita." Mommy says that's the only song you know. Oh, she does, huh? Yeah. Do it like you did when you used to serenade Mommy. Uh, Kathy, Daddy's busy now. Why don't you go out and ask Betty to put the steaks on. Okay, but I do want to hear Daddy serenade. Remember when you used to do that? What's become of that young man who stood under my window and played his banjo? Oh, I suppose it was kind of corny, but I loved it. Honey, I'd look awfully silly now standing out in the yard playing the banjo. The neighbors would have me locked up. Oh, they would not. Jim, I don't ask you to do many things. Honey, I don't mind being asked. I do not like to be pushed. The least you could've done was to have discussed it with me before going ahead. Would you have gone if we discussed it first? Certainly not. That's what I figured. All right, go ahead! Stay in your rut if you want to. I don't care. You know, you're right. I am in a rut. And I may just take your advice and try something different... say, um... I'll drop in at the club tonight... see the boys. The club? Why, you haven't been there in ages. That's just it! You mentioned boredom. I read an article last week where an authority said that even people who are in love should take a vacation from each other... if only for an evening. After all, I used to enjoy those evenings with the boys. Few hands of cards, stimulating discussion. And what happened? I got married. Did I ever stop you? Well... no, but that's a side of a man's life he shouldn't have to give up. Well, why don't you go down there, then? Maybe you can get into a nice stimulating discussion about old-age pensions. I remember one night we sat up until almost 3:00 discussing Caesar's Commentaries. Well... why don't you put on your tunic and your sandals and go? I intend to go. Fine! When you come back, don't look for me because I'll be out dancing. Come and get it! The steaks are ready, and are they mellow! I, uh... I don't think I'll eat tonight, Bud. I'm not... particularly hungry. Neither am I. You children go ahead. Oh, boy! Two extra steaks for me! Hey, Betty! Hey, that was cute. Do it again. Was that one of the new dances you're learning tonight, Daddy? Mmhh... Yes, angel. That's one of the new dances we're learning. Evidently. I thought you were gonna learn some Mexican dances, so I thought maybe Daddy'd like to borrow this. You have to ask your father about that, dear. But I imagine he'd prefer something more scholarly, like a... a mortarboard. The square shape would match his head. Huh? You, uh, may tell your mother she's being very witty this evening. What does... "witty" mean? I'm not sure I know what anything means anymore. Well, gosh, Claude, I don't know. Well, don't do anything till tomorrow. Yeah. Bye. Boy, have we got a problem. You've got a problem. Huh! Claude wants to run in a ringer for tomorrow's game, but I don't know about a third baseman with a name like that. I don't see what difference a name makes. Alice? Alice? Yeah. We need that power in the lineup, but... I don't know about a... girl. Don't do it, son. In two weeks, she'll be trying to run the team. May I come in? Oh, yeah. Come on in, Ed. Oh. Hi, Jim. Hello, Ed. Is, um, Margaret ready? I don't know. You'll, uh, have to check with her on that. Is it really true you're going to the club tonight? Mm-hmm. Well, how did you manage it? Well, Ed, I've always contended that man is born free and he ought to stay that way. I'll see you later, Ed. How come you're not going to the club tonight, Mr. Davis? Uh... well, Bud, I, um... Would you be a good boy and run upstairs and see if your mother's ready? Hello, Mr. Davis. I'll get her for you. Oh, thanks, Betty. Mother! Mr. Davis is here! Ohh... Ooh, you look beautiful, Mother, just beautiful! Thanks. Come on. They're waiting for you. Um... Betty, I... I... I'm not going. Not going? Oh, yes, you are. You've got to. Do you remember what you said about timing? Well, this is the moment. Now, come on. You've gotta show him you can be just as independent as he can. Well, I... I... You'll have fun after you get there. What I ought to do is call Father at the club and tell him to meet you there. No. Leave him alone. Let the male animal roam the prairie. He'll return to the cave when he gets through barking at the moon. I hope. Where's all the gang tonight? Oh, they're, um... Well, who you mean? Oh, you know. The guys. Charlie Spencer, Frank Dawson. Oh, Frank. Haven't seen old Frank around in a long time. I don't know what happened to him. He's laid up with a rheumatism again. He's got it almost as bad as I have. Charlie got married. Charlie did? Pretty good-looking gal. Couple of kids. So now poor old Charlie has to eat all that home-cooked food and sit in front of the fireplace and play with the kids. Has to miss all this fun. Oh! Mrs. Anderson, I'd like you to meet Mr. Glasser. Mr. Glasser's one of our best instructors. How do you do? Oh, wonderful. She's a beginner. Oh! That's wonderful. That's just fine. How are you this evening, Mrs. Davis? Just fine. Mr. Davis? Fine, thanks. So you're a beginner. That's just fine. Oh, you'll have a lot of fun. We don't turn out very many Veloz and Yolandas, but we do have fun. The Davises are coming along nicely with the mamba, very nicely. Oh, thank you. But I think you'll want to start out with something a little less, uh, zippy? Do you have anything special that you'd like to start on? Well, anything except the two-step and the waltz. Oh, you're priceless! But shall we try a few steps, see just how much spade work we have to do? ♪♪ Yeah. Well, you take the old-age pension. A man gets to the end of his life, and I say he's entitled. Jim. Hmm? It's your turn. Oh, oh. Yeah, sure. Well? Go on. Take 'em. It's your trick. Oh. By George, it is. Where's your mind tonight, Jim? Oh, I don't know. I was just thinking about the night we sat up till 3 A.M. arguing over Caesar's Commentaries. Remember? Yep. Old Walt was in on that. Doesn't old Walt come around much anymore? No, not much. Not since his funeral. Old Walt? Roy, what do you do for arthritis? I can hardly walk in the morning. Don't go anywhere till after noon. How's the missus, Jim? Oh... Haven't seen her in a long time now. I suppose with the kids and all, she doesn't get out and kick up her heels very much. Oh, she, uh... she kicks them up... occasionally. ♪♪ ♪♪ Fine, fine. You're doing wonderful, Mrs. Anderson. You just need to relax a little more. That's the wonderful thing about dancing. It's so relaxing. Oh, yes, isn't it? You having fun, honey? Oh... Oh, it's fine. She's coming along nicely. Why, I believe we can zoom right into the mamba. Oh... Oh, no, no, no. No, thanks very much. But you're ready for it. Well, I... I... I'm afraid I have a headache. I... I think I ought to go home. Good. I'll drive you home. Come on, Myrtle. Oh, no, no, no. I don't want you to go home on my account. I'll... I'll call a cab. Could I use your phone? Certainly. Look, Myrtle, if she's got a headache, uh... Oh, my. She needs lessons, too. She's the only customer I ever had who waltzes the samba. Why, mother, what are you doing home? It isn't even 9:00 yet. Well, I... I had a headache. Children all right? Sure. What happened? Didn't you have a good time? Oh, yes. It was fun. Only I... I guess I'm just not cut out for this wild life. I... I think I'll go to bed. Tell Kathy it's her bedtime. Yes, Mother. Come on, squirt. If you can't make a word, pass. Is "oogloo" a word? I told you, you can't use foreign words. Kathy, Mother wants you to go to bed. Is she home from the school already? Mm-hmm. What'd she do, flunk rumba? Oh, keep quiet! You men, all so crass. No feelings. No romance. No sentiment! What're you jumping on me for? What did I do? Oh, you wouldn't understand. Well, gee, I... Hi, Daddy! Oh, hello, Kitten. Aren't you home a little early from the club? Ahh, hmm. Will you play the banjo for me now, Daddy? No, I don't think so, Kitten. I'm kinda tired. I, uh... I think I'll go to bed. Oh, Daddy. Hmm? When you go up, will you ask Mommy if I can stay down for just one more game? Ask Mommy? Is she home? Yes, and she has a headache, too. Hmm. Well... come on, sis. Your turn. I said it's your turn. Huh? Oh. I just hope she doesn't forgive him too quickly... makes him suffer a little first. What are you yapping about? Oh, nothing. Here's a good word. Drip. Well, I thought I heard your father's voice in here. You did. Didn't he come upstairs? Well, I didn't see him. Gee, that's funny. He found that you were home, and he ran out of here. And naturally, I thought... Well, gee, I wonder where he did go. ♪♪ Hey, where's the cornball music coming from? Sounds like it's outside. I bet you it's Daddy! ♪♪ ♪ Nita ♪ ♪ Juanita ♪ ♪ Ask thy soul ♪ ♪ If we should part ♪ ♪ Nita ♪ ♪ Juanita ♪ ♪ Lean thou ♪ ♪ On my heart ♪ Fair señorita, this unworthy caballero wishes to ask the young señorita if she will honor him by going dancing with him this evening.

I'll be right up to get you. No. No, stay where you are. I'll be right down. We don't want to waste this wonderful moon. ♪♪ Sorry, honey. Too late. I tried to keep them inside.

We didn't eat any dinner! Let's see what we can find in old reliable. Oh. What were we trying to find? I've found it.
