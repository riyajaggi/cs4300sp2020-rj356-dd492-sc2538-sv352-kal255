 Robert Young... and Jane Wyatt... with Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray, and Lauren Chapin... Want the first-aid kit? Don't you know your father's pretty touchy about that shaver? What shaver? This shaver. Oh, gee, Mom, I'm not even half-shaved yet. Well, you can finish the job in about five years from now. Gee whiz, Mom, I'm not a kid anymore. I know, Bud.

 Then why is it every time I want to do something, somebody always says, "Don't do this, don't do that." Bud! Yeah? Telephone, Bud! Coming! Oh, Bud, don't give it to me. Don't come down the stairs like that, Bud. You sound like an elephant wearing golf shoes. Hello? Oh, hi, Joe. No matter what it is you want, I can't do it. Sounds great, but I can't go. Wait. I'll ask my dad, but it's no use. How do you know it's no use?

 You shouldn't make up your mind in advance. You make me sound like your jailer instead of your father. Can I go with the fellas on our motor scooters to the stone quarry? No. I knew I couldn't. But, Bud, the reason is... All right, Snaps. So long. Bud, will you please let me explain? That's right on the main highway, and there's a lot of fast, dangerous traffic out there, and you boys are much too young to... Why can't I live my own life? I'm a human being, you know. What do you suppose has gotten into that boy? He seems to resent everything you say to him. Oh, it's nothing, really. Just the normal signs of growing up. The young male animal asserting himself. Well, I hope that's all it is. Yesterday, he even talked about moving away. He wouldn't do that, would he? Bud? You couldn't drive him out of here with a rawhide whip. At least not as long as we've got food around. So long. So long... Betty. Bye, Freddie. Bye, Freddie. So long, kiddo. So long. Bye. Bud Anderson! I couldn't help it. Well I... I guess I'd better be going. Bye. Bud Anderson, don't you ever do a thing like that again! "Don't, don't, don't." Is that the only word anybody knows around here? And don't do that! You'll break a window! "The Hidden Key to Success, or Harnessing the Subconscious." Oh. Actually, I can't understand it. But I love to read things I can't understand 'cause then I feel as though I'm getting somewhere. Betty? Oh, thanks. Freddie says the main idea is that you release your subconscious... or something. Understand? Perfectly. Think your way to anything, anything you want. And how do you do that? Well, you simply mesh your subconscious mind with your conscious mind. I must do that sometime. Freddie says it'll change my whole life, so I'm gonna take it up. Take what up? Oh, nothing. You wouldn't understand. Wait'll you grow up. Eeeek! What hit you? Oh, for Pete's sake! Have you been in the paint? For heaven's sake, Bud! Go take those clothes off, and I'll soak them in turpentine or something. You know, I should read this right now, 'cause Freddie might come over later to discuss it. But I ought to spend the time fixing my hair. I don't know what to do. Well, can't you mesh your subconscious and think a few curls into it? Father, you're so pedestrian. Bud, change your clothes and wash your hands before you eat. Okay, okay. Dad, about that trip to the stone quarry. I'd be real careful. But, Bud, those cars travel awful fast. It just wouldn't be safe for you kids. If anything should happen to you I'd... Daddy! Daddy, can I sell some taffy? It's for our club, The Little Squaws. Well, if The Little Squaws need it, sure. Oh, boy! I have to sell 30 boxes. How come she gets to do everything she wants to do and I don't get to do anything? Now, that's not true. Don't you understand? I just don't want you risking your life. Aw, a lot anybody cares about my life. Now, wait, Bud. Would you like to buy some taffy? No! Gee, what's the matter with him? Oh, it's nothing, Kitten. Well, it may be nothing, but I wish we knew what to do about it. I feel as though I just don't know how to handle him anymore. Oh, he'll get over it if we just don't make an issue of it. Things are crowding him a little now, and he's feeling trapped, as all boys do now and then. Half an hour from now, he'll be over it. Here, Daddy. Sign for the taffy. 50 cents a box. Now, wait a minute. I didn't say I was gonna take all 30 boxes. You try to sell those to other people first, and if you have any left, maybe I'll buy them. Okay. Mommy, would you buy some? Nope. Okay, I tried. I have 30 left. How many do you want? Bud! Hey, Bud! Oh, hi, Bud. Hi, Clark. Wanna look through my telescope? Naw. I traded old Whitey out of it. Gave him my old banjo. Good deal, huh? Boy, this is powerful! I can see a man's foot, and you'd swear it was right here in your own yard. Just think what it'll do when it gets a lens in it. Wanna try it? Naw. What'sa matter? You sick? No, I'm okay. I'm just sick of this jailhouse. Your folks clampin' down on ya? They won't let me do a thing. That ain't no way to live, boy. They treat me like I was a little kid. What do you suppose gets into parents? They got the same advantages we got. Look how they turn out. You'd think they'd'a learned more, considerin' how old they are. Aw, they don't know how to handle kids. It takes the YMCA for that. The Y's got a ping-pong table, punchin' bag, trapeze. I put up a punchin' bag in our living room. But my old man took it right down. Someday I'm gonna move away from here. Why don't you do it now? Now? You ain't gettin' any younger, boy. But where would I go? There's a real keen room up over Ingle's Feed Store. Yeah? Only five bucks a month. All you gotta do is sweep the store out every mornin'. Gee, I wonder if I should. You ain't gettin' any younger, boy. I wonder. Just think how sorry they'll be for treating you so mean. When you come back for a visit, boy, watch 'em knock themselves out trying to be nice to you. They'll treat you like a king... A real, genuine, royal king. Oh! Oh, why did we ever let him go away? I realize now he was my favorite child. We were blind fools. Blind, blind fools! Will he ever come back? I doubt it. We're getting just what we deserve. Oh, I wonder how he is. Oh, he'll get along, with all of his talent and personality and ability. But can we get along without him? I know I can't. I'll perish. Jim, could that... could that be? ♪♪ Bud! My, this little tot is getting bigger. And this one will be grown before you know it. Thank you. You may get up now. Are you... Are you going to stay? I don't think so. I have a lovely room at the feed store: a 40-inch television set, a refrigerator full of banana splits, trapeze, punching bag... But, son, haven't you noticed how we've redone the living room for you? But look in the dining room! Bud, this is your place. Ooh. I'd better wash first. Oh, that's ridiculous. Sit down. Wait a minute, Bud. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Bud. Wait a minute, Bud. Wait a minute. What's the matter with you? Let go! I haven't even tasted it yet. Tasted what? Oh. Uh... You've sure been acting funny. Sure you ain't sick? No, I'm okay. I... never felt better. Claude. About that room over the feed store. You sure a fella could get it? Sure. I was just down there this mornin' talking to old man Engel. Want to look through my telescope now? I don't need it. I can see everything real clear now. Everything. I thought I told you to change your clothes and to wash those hands. Wash? Why, that's ridiculous. Bud, I don't like to hear you talk that way. Well, maybe you won't have to listen to me much longer. I just might get a room. Get a room? Sure. Over Engel's feed store. Ohh... What are you talking about? Just that. I can get this room for five dollars, and all I have to do is sweep out the feed store every morning. Probably get your meals there, too. Sounds like a pretty good idea. Why don't you do it? You mean you'd let me? Sure. As you say, you're old enough to live your own life. Jim! Uh, I think the first thing you'll have to do is pack. You'll need a suitcase. I'll get that old brown one of mine for you. Wait, Dad. Don't get a suitcase. Oh? Changed your mind, huh? No, it's not that. A suitcase'd be too small. I'll need Mom's big old trunk. Jim, are you going to stand there painting all day? Don't you realize our son is leaving? Oh, no, he isn't. Well, he's upstairs packing that trunk. Sure, but that's just a big bluff. You know that as well as I. Well, we know it, but does he? Margaret, I tell you, the only way to handle a situation like this is to... Bud? Yes? Uh, it's nothing, son. Go on. Do you want him to leave? Of course not. I just know it's best to ignore it. I did the same thing when I was a kid. I threatened to run away just to watch my folks react. The more they carried on, the farther I pushed it, so I know... I'd love to watch him try to pack that bicycle frame in the trunk. Dear, why don't you go upstairs and talk to him? Margaret, there's nothing to talk about right now. He just has to get this out of his own system his own way. Well, if you're not gonna do anything about it, I am. No, wait. I'll go. Takes a man to handle a situation like this. Here. You, uh... sure you're taking enough stuff, Bud? Enough to get started on. Yeah, you won't need towels. Living alone, you won't have to wash so often. Besides, there'll always be a lot of old feed sacks around the store. Daddy, would you like to buy some real keen, delicious taffy? 20 cents a box. 20? I thought it was 50. I had to cut the price. I can't sell that old stuff. Hey, where's Bud going? Well, Kathy, I know this is going to come as a shock to you, and I want you to take it bravely, but Bud is moving away. He's leaving us. Can I have his room? Well, is Bud really leaving? I mean, really? And your father keeps insisting that he isn't, but I'm not so sure he's handling it right. Oh, it's not that I don't think that your father has wonderful ideas. It's just that... well, they don't work. Well, he might have picked out a better place. I can just hear my friends say, "Where's your brother?" And I say, "Oh, he's living in a feed store." Well, if I'd had my way... Well? Well, what? Did you talk him out of it? I didn't try. But, Jim... Oh, honey, stop worrying. He isn't gonna leave. He just wants us to plead with him to stay. Well, let's do it. No, no, no, no. That'll just prolong it. If we stop him now, he'll feel all the more frustrated. He's got to feel that this is his own decision. Say, I bet Freddy could tell us how to handle this. Freddy? Certainly. You should hear his conversation. It's horribly deep. I don't doubt that. But I don't need a genius to tell me the only way to handle Bud is to ignore the whole thing. Now, remember, when he comes down to leave, sit down, act as though it's nothing out of the ordinary. Well, what if he does leave? Honey, believe me, he'll never leave this house. Oh! I'll bet that's Freddy! Hello, Freddy. Hi. Hi. Hello. That Freddy's conversation certainly is deep. Freddy, I'd like you to meet my mother and father. - Oh, glad to know you. - Hello, Freddy. Freddy, could you help us with a problem? Well, sure. Well, if you had a little brother and he was gonna leave home, how would you handle it? Well, you take and mesh the subconscious with the conscious, and then you... Never mind. Dad? Yes, son? You all packed? Well, the trunk's all packed. But it's so heavy, I can't get it out of the bedroom. Oh, I see. Well, don't worry about it. Why don't you go on ahead, and I'll have it sent down to you? Uh, well, if it wouldn't be too much bother. Oh, no, no, no. No bother at all. I hope we'll see you once in a while. Christmas, Fourth of July. But we don't want to clutter up your life. We know you'll be busy... sweeping and all. Yeah. Well... I'm going now. Guess I'll... take off now. So long. Well, I... guess I've got everything. Ta-ta. Bud, wait! Well, okay. But hurry up. I'm going. What your mother wanted to say was good-bye. Good-bye. Son, uh... are you sure you want to go through with this? I want to live my own life. Well, that's fine. I just wanted to make sure. Uh, I'll tell you what. I'll drive you down there. I'd like to have a look at that room before you move in. I'm gonna take it. Oh, I know. But, you know, let's... let's have a look at it first. Why don't you wait in the car while I change my clothes? Okay. Ain't what you would call fancy, but it's clean. And it's close to the streetcars and Birney's fish market. Some folks don't care particular about fish. I don't eat 'em myself. Now, down there is the tracks to the BTO&M; Railroad, formerly called the BTMQ&D; Railroad. I like the old name better myself. The last party that occupied the room, he put these papers under here. Claims they keep out the cold. It's a matter of opinion. Now, uh... Now, this here is the kitchen, you might say. And, uh, it's best to unscrew the lightbulb while you're usin' the hotplate. Get too much juice coming through, and you blow a fuse. There's dishes and pans and, uh... Oh, uh, if this here gets leakin', I'll replace it. Uh, what about the water? Oh, sure. Got that. Just down the fire escape, turn to the left. Bathroom's in the rear of the store. Sounds handy. It is. Well, you look her over. And just take your time. I got to get back downstairs. Well, thank you, Mr. Engel. Well, Bud, what do you think? It's fine. Not fancy, but it's close to the fish market. Climbing that fire escape for your water will keep a guy in shape. That's a real advantage. Meals are no problem. If you feel hungry, just open a can of soup and turn off the light, heat it up. Eat it right out of the can. No dishes to wash. Nobody to tell you what to do or... what not to do. By George, this is the life. Yeah. I'll have your trunk sent down right away. That is, unless you'd like to wait a few months till school's over? No, sir. I'm staying. Oh. Uh-huh. Well, remember, if you're ever out our way, be sure to drop in and say hello. Sure. So long. So long. I was wonderin' how come a boy like him was rentin' a room. Yeah. Trouble is, I never thought he'd go this far. I was positive he'd never get ten feet out of our front yard. Well, you take boys... I wouldn't want to tell his mother this, but, frankly, I'm worried. He acts as though he doesn't want to come back. Well, maybe he needs a reason. Reason? Well, isn't a good home reason enough and a family that loves him? I don't think you get my drift. You see, him and you have pushed this so far that neither one of you can back down. He wants to come back in the worst way, but his pride won't let him. Well, what do we do, then? Mr. Anderson, would you take a suggest from an old man who never had any boys of his own? Are you sure Mr. Engel knows what he's talking about? It made good sense to me. There. That'll fix it so it won't work. All right, Betty. Call him. Here, Daddy. This will really bust it good. No, Kitten. We don't want to wreck it completely. Aw, shucks. I thought we were gonna have some fun. Bud! Oh, Bud! Telephone! Hello? This is Betty. Say, I hate to bother you, but my radio's gone on the blink again. No, I don't know what's the matter with it. Daddy busted it. Shh! Oh, I hate to ask you to come out here and fix it, but... well, you seem to be the only one that understands it. Do you think you might find time? Well, I'm awful busy right now doin' some pretty important junk, but... maybe I can squeeze out some time. No, no. I can't make it right now. Well, say, how about... five minutes from now? Yeah. Good-bye. Okay, Kathy. Plug it in. ♪♪ Attaboy, Bud! Oh, Bud, that's wonderful! That was your whole trouble right there. The rectifier tube needed... readjusting. Gee, how do you know all that stuff? Now can you fix this? My gosh! What happened to it? A hammer hit it... accidentally. This is in pretty bad shape. I'll have to work on it out in the garage. Well, Bud, as long as you're going out there, I wonder if you'd mind showing me how to adjust the lawnmower. I can't make head nor tail of the thing. Don't worry about it, Dad. I'll take care of the lawn. Gee, Bud, I never realized how much we needed you. Gosh. Neither did I. I think I'll stick around. Mom? Yes, Bud? I'm hungry. Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services, Inc.
