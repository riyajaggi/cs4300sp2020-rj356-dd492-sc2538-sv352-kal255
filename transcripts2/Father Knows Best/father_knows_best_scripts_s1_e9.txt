 Father Knows Best (1954–1960): Season 1, Episode 9 - Second Honeymoon - full transcript 
 Getting ready to leave work for the weekend Jim's friend comes by and tells him that he and his wife are off to a lodge for the weekend. He invites Jim and Margaret along, but Jim says they couldn't leave their children at home. By the time Jim reaches home he is thinking a weekend away would be a great idea, especially after finding Margaret cleaning spilled paint off Kathy and helping Betty get ready for a date. Jim convinces Margaret a trip would be a good idea and as she gets ready he tries to tell the kids, but is interrupted by Bud's going on and on about fixing a motor, so Jim gives up. But Margaret helps him get his resolve back and the parents have a meeting at which they tell the children they will be going away for two days. Unexpectedly, none of the kids is against the idea, Betty even saying she'll just cancel her date. So off Jim and Margaret go, although on the drive out of town they are already missing the kids, who meantime are doing fine. Betty does become annoyed when the boy she broke the date with, Ralph, keeps calling her. At the lodge the Andersons become restless, seemingly not knowing how to relax or enjoy their time away from home. They decide to check in with the kids and call home, but no one answers the telephone. Betty has refused to pick up the receiver, believing it is Ralph calling again. Worried by not being able to check in, Margaret and Jim race back home, finding the kids watching TV, and Betty apologizes for causing their concern. Back at the lodge Jim and Margaret are now enjoying the rustic room they booked, and out from an adjoining room come Betty, Bud and Kathy to say goodnight.

 Robert Young... and Jane Wyatt. With Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray, and Lauren Chapin Hello, Fred. Come on in. I just stopped by to say au revoir, Jim. Lila and I are gettin' out of town for the weekend. Good. Oh, did you get those policies straightened out on the Carlton Corporation? Yep. All finished. So I said to myself, "Now's the time to take a couple of days off."

 Oh, Miss Thomas, will you call my home again and see if that line's still busy? I just tried, Mr. Anderson. Still busy. Well, keep trying. I will. Yep, it's the only way to break out of a rut, Jim. A fella's just gotta get ahold of himself and make up his mind he's gonna go... and go. Me, I picked up the phone, called Lila, and said, "Throw some stuff in the bag. We're goin' up "to Willow Springs for the weekend. I'll be home in 20 minutes." Well, it sounds great, but of course, you and Lila don't have children to consider. No. No, that's true, but like I always tell Lila,

 "Ya can't have everything." You and Margaret have the family, Lila and I have the freedom. When we want to take off, we take off. Well, Margaret and I aren't exactly prisoners. If we wanted to go somewhere, we could go. Hey, by golly! Why don't you and Margaret come along with us? Make it a foursome. We'll have a ball! Well, I... Maybe we... Excuse me, Mr. Anderson. I have a call to your home. Oh. Take it on one. Thank you. Hello. Hello, honey. What's been going on there? I've been trying to call you for an hour. Oh. Hmm. Well, I just wondered if there's anything you wanted me to bring home. Oh. Well, look, honey, Fred Baker's here, and he... Sure, I'll hold on. My daughter Betty can't find her blouse. She has a date or something. Well, Jim, ask Margaret about the weekend. Yeah? Yeah, I'm still here. Well, what I started to say was that Fred and Lila are planning to go up to... Yeah. I'll hold on. My small daughter Kathy got into some paint in the garage. You have a hectic little house out there. Hello, dear. Is everything all right? Well, I was just thinking that, uh, perhaps you and I might... Oh. Hmm. Oh, wait, Fred. Just a minute. You're busy, Jim. I gotta go. Lila's waiting for me. I'll see you, boy. Wa... Hello, honey. Well, as I was saying, Fred was in here, and we were talking. And I just thought that maybe you and I could... Hmm? Well, you go ahead, honey. I'll... I'll talk to you when I get home. Yeah. Good-bye, dear. You're getting soap in my eyes! Then close your eyes. I can't take this paint off without using soap. Mother! Oh, I'm in the kitchen, Betty! Do you know where my... What happened? Oh, she was climbing up the shelves in the garage, and a can of paint fell down. Stand still, Kathy. I'll fix it, Mommy. Oh... Kathy... I didn't know it was on my hands! If you aren't a glamorous picture. Well, I can't help it. When I finish this, I'm going upstairs and try to make myself look human. Who came in? Bud? Margaret? Oh, it's father! Well, it can't be. It's not even 5:30. Where are you, honey? You can't let him see you like this. You're a mess. You wanna hide in the basement? That's what Bud does. Margaret! I'll be right there, dear. Will you finish up? Her clean dress is on the ironing board. Jim? Hello, honey. I have the most won... Well! If you aren't a glamorous picture. Oh, Kathy got into the garage and doused herself with a can of green paint. It's just been one of those days. I don't see how you can stand to look at me. You always look great to me. You know that. And just to prove it... for you. Why, Jim! Ohh! Oh, Jim, they're beautiful! Darling. But why? And your new suit. Yeah. Do you like it? It's handsome. Margaret, I had a brilliant idea this afternoon. I said to myself, "This is the time for you and Margaret to take a couple of days off." Let's get in the car and just go someplace, just you and me. You mean... just leave? Sure. We'll drive up to Cedar Lodge, stay till Sunday night, just the two of us, nobody else. Oh, darling, it's a wonderful idea, but... Don't try to think of any reasons why we can't go. Well, I'm not, but what about the children? Honey, the children are old enough to take care of themselves for one weekend. You can't devote every minute of every day of your life to them. It isn't fair to them, and it isn't fair to us. Well, I... I know. I know... We love the children. We give them everything we can. But we must also make them understand that you and I are entitled to something, too, some life of our own. And after all, one trip away from home... Well, I... I suppose... Now, don't make a problem out of it. We simply decide we're going, and we go. The children are just not going to understand. You leave the children to me. I'll take care of this. You run upstairs and get dressed. We'll leave in about half an hour. Well... anything you say, dear. That-a-girl. ♪♪ Oh, there you are. How do you like me, Daddy? I'm clean. Oh, you look beautiful, Kitten. Oh, the time I had getting the paint off this child. How do you like my new perfume? It's turpentine. It's delightful. Look, kids, while you're here. I wanted to... Oh, hi, Dad. Hello, Bud. I want to talk to you, too. I want to talk to you, too. Can you help me fix the motor out of my motor scooter? Not tonight, Bud. Your mother and I... Take a look at it? I got it right here on the back porch. But, Bud, I... I can't do... You can probably fix it real easy. I got it all apart for you. Well, you see, your mother and I are g... We'll help you, Dad. You can work on it tonight. Bud, take that dirty old machinery out of the kitchen. Hmm. Rings look all right. Please, Bud, put it down in the basement. Hello. Ralph? Betty. No, no, no, no. The whole box. Yeah, I found my skates, all right. Are you going to the movies with us tonight, Daddy? Well, not tonight, Kitten. You see, your mother... I'll be down in the basement when you're ready, Dad. Well, Bud, I wanted to... Oh, that's all right. My father'll drive us over. No! No! Why don't you go with us, Daddy? It's Friday night. Excuse me, Ralph. Can't you take us, Father? Not tonight. That's what I've been trying to explain to you. You won't have to pay for us... just for your own ticket. Father says he can't do it, but my mother'll drive us over. No. No. No! She can't do that! She's taking us to the movies. Isn't she, Daddy? Well... I-I-I don't know, Kitten. Uh... We'll see. Father, will you ask mother? How'd you come out? I was ambushed. What did the children say when you told them your plan? I didn't tell them. They had so many plans of their own, all of which include us, I didn't have the heart. We're trapped, plain trapped. You'd think that once, just once, you and I could go away, just the two of us. Do you know the last time we took a trip together? Nine years ago when the dog ran away. Went over to Willowville to bring him back. Seems like only yesterday. Not to me, it doesn't. Sometimes I think we give up too much for the kids. They're beginning to take it for granted they can order us around like we were their servants. I think we should put a stop to it right now, be firm with them. I agree. We've stayed at home for them hundreds of times. Why can't they stay home for us just once? No reason at all. Why don't you go downstairs and ask them? You ask them. It was your idea. Probably won't do any good. You know what'll happen. Big tears. "Don't go. Don't leave us." You'd think they couldn't live five minutes without us. Well, at least they don't hate us. But it isn't good for them to be so dependent on us. They have to learn to be able to do for themselves, be on their own. All right. Let's simply go down and tell them we're going... be firm. Well, we can try, but the odds are against us. Hi there, Daddy. What are we gonna do? We're going to have a meeting. Well, let's hurry. We've gotta go to the movie. It starts in a couple hours. Well, we're gonna have a meeting. Uh-oh. What'd you want, Father? It's a meeting. Well, will it take long? I've got a million things to do. No, it'll... probably be over in a minute. Briefly, kids, this is what the meeting is about. I, uh, was able to get a couple of days off from the office, so I thought that perhaps Mother and I might make a little trip, just the two of us. It's, uh, been a long time since Mother and I have been anywhere, uh, together. Uh, we were going this afternoon, but since you children had plans for this evening, we thought it best to see how you felt about it. I think it's a perfectly beautiful idea. You do? Can we go? Oh, Of course not, silly. Oh, I think it's the most romantic thing I've ever heard... that my mother and father want to go away just with each other. Well, Princess, you realize that this means that you'll have to... Cancel my date tonight? Who cares? Oh, I'd 10,000 times rather see you and Mother go on this trip. Well, it'll be like a second honeymoon. Uh... what do you think, Bud? I think the trouble's in the carburetor. Wake up, dummy. I'll call Ralph and tell him the date's off. Then we'll go up in the attic and get the suitcases. I'll get the suitcases! I'll wipe up the car for you. Well, children... Well... you don't... I'll go get your coats and things while you pack. You and Father enjoy yourselves, and don't even think about us. Well, I guess we have everything. Bye, Daddy. Good-bye, Kitten. Be a good girl. Good-bye, Bud. You'll... You'll take care of everything, won't you? Well, sure, I will, Mom. Good-bye, Princess. Good-bye, Father. You know where to reach us if anything comes up. I have the number. We'll be all right. Good-bye, Son. I guess you'll have to be man of the house while we're gone. Good-bye, angel. We'll be okay, Dad. You and Mom just have a big time. You and Daddy write to us. Oh, angel, we're going to be gone two days. Now, you be real good. Oh, Betty! You'll... You'll take care of everything, won't you? And if you need anything, you go next-door to the Davises. We will. Bye-bye, Mother. Now, don't even think about us, not for a minute. We're gonna get along just fine. Good-bye. Have fun. Bye! Good-bye, darlings. So long. It was a wonderful idea of yours, dear. Going on a trip? Just... Just the two of us. Yeah. It's beginning to feel like we're really on a trip now. I'm enjoying it already. So am I. It does seem good to get away. Doesn't it? It sure does. I haven't even thought about the office or the house or anything. Have you? No. No, I... I'm just enjoying the trip. Oh, the kids have probably finished dinner. They're getting ready for bed now. Oh, I hope Betty remembers to put the extra blanket on Kathy. She will. Now, quit worrying, honey. Oh... I... I'm not worrying. We're on a trip. We know the children are all right, so we're simply going to put them out of our minds and be free. Enjoy ourselves. You're right, dear. Of course I am. How long have we been gone? Seven minutes. Kathy! Well, I told you before. Mother and Father... Put the tablecloth on the table! Hello, Ralph. Well, they left this evening, and I'm taking care of Bud and Kathy. I mean Bud and I are taking care of Kathy. So I can't go out with you tonight. Oh, Mother and Father went up to Cedar Lodge. No, I can't go out with you! N-o, no! ♪♪ It's a nice room. Yeah, not bad. You got a beautiful bride, dad. Mmm, boy. If you think she's beautiful, you should see our 17-year-old daughter. Well, honey... here we are. As the bellhop said, do I have a beautiful bride. Mmm, boy. Isn't it wonderful being here? Just the two of us. It's so quiet. Shall we, uh, take off our coats? Oh. Sure. Isn't this terrific, honey? Every married couple should plan to get away like this... get away from home and the children and the uproar. The trouble with most people is, they have the mistaken idea that their children can't get along without them. They can't get away like this and... relax. It's a big mistake, too... tying oneself to one's children. Believe me, they appreciate their parents a whole lot more if they have to do without them once in a while. This is the smartest move we ever made. I agree. Yes, sir, it certainly is good to get away. Oh... I'm enjoying it already. This is going to be a wonderful weekend, honey. I may just sit here and never move. It's nice, isn't it? Sure seems good, doesn't it? Oh, it certainly does. I wonder what the kids are doing now. Oh... Oh... Bud's probably down in the cellar... fixing up that old motor. What a brave front the kids put up, pretending they weren't going to miss us. Little Kathy... they way she held up her arms to me, wanting to be picked up when we were saying good-bye. Hello? Now, look here, Ralph, I told you before. I can't go out with you tonight. Well, I meant it, and don't call again. Good-bye. Five times, he's called. That square just won't quit. Honey, we could go to the movies tonight. There's a theater in the village. Yeah. What's playing? Prairie Justice with Hoot Gibson and the Gold Diggers of 1939. And Keno. Honey, I have an idea. Let's call home. Oh, let's! The kids are probably lonesome. It'll give 'em a big thrill. Uh, I'd like to call Springfield. 2-2-7-4. Just... let 'em know we got here all right. After all, this is the first time we've ever been away from them. They're ringing. Oh... what's the matter? There's no answer. Yes, operator? Well, there must be someone there. Yes. Keep trying. I wonder where they could be. Oh, they probably just ran next-door to see the Davises or... or went for a walk for a few minutes. Oh, there's... there's nothing to worry about, dear. Oh, I know there isn't, but, uh... Hello, Jim. Surprise! Fred. I called your office after I got home, and your secretary told me that you and your wife were coming up here. So I changed our reservations, and here we are. Boy, what a weekend this is going to be. Well, that's great, Fred. Uh, you... you know Margaret, don't you? Yeah, sure, sure. It's been a long time, but I certainly remember you. Nice to meet you again. Thank you. And this is my little wife Lila. Margaret and Jim Anderson. Hello. How do you do, Lila? Nice to know you. Fred said, he said, "We must get up and see the Andersons." He says, "It'll be a million laughs." Just think... we got a whole weekend ahead of us. Oh, man, are we gonna have fun! Got somebody to take care of the kids, eh, Jim? Well... no. As a matter of fact, uh... You people with children. You have to get away once in a while. I know, because I've been takin' hula lessons from a lady who has two children. Kids, wait. Wait'll you see Lila do the hula. Five lessons, and you won't believe it! You won't believe it. Here, show 'em how you do it, honey. Oh, they don't want to see that. Why, sure! Sure, they do! Come on. We gotta get the party on the road here. Right, Jim. Right? Oh, sure. All right. All right, honey. Now, show 'em how they do it out on old Waikiki. ♪♪ Let's pick up the beat. Let's rock it. ♪ Da da da da da-da da ♪ ♪ Da da-da da da da-da da ♪ ♪♪ Boy, isn't she great? And only five lessons! Hey, honey, show Jim how to do it. Well, I... I don't think I, um... Oh, sure, you can. No, really, I... You just relax. Just follow me. Do as I do. It's a lot of fun. Okay. Here we go. ♪ Da da da ♪ ♪ Da dum ♪ ♪ Mmm da da ♪ ♪ Da-da ♪ ♪ Da da da da da dee ♪ ♪ Da-da da-da ♪ ♪ Dum mmm ♪ ♪ Da da da-da ♪ ♪ Da da da da da dee ♪ ♪ Dum dum dum dum ♪ ♪ Dum dum ♪ ♪ Dum dum dum ♪ ♪ Da dee ♪ ♪ Da da da da da dee ♪ ♪ Dum dum dum dum ♪ ♪ Dum dum dum dum ♪ Hello? Well, keep ringing! ♪♪ Why don't you answer it and tell that guy to cut it out! I'm not gonna talk to him. He's just doing this to be mean. Well, let me answer it! I'll tell him! No! Wait'll I see that Ralph tomorrow. ♪♪ Fred and his wife must've thought we'd lost our minds. I'm sure they didn't understand why we raced out. We can explain to Fred and Hula some other time. Fred and Lila. I wonder where those kids could be! Betty wouldn't leave the house. She... She promised she wouldn't. Oh, that Ralph probably called, talked her into going out. I can't believe that Betty would break a promise. I can't, either. But the kids have gone somewhere. We've just got to find out what's going on! ♪♪ Oh, no! Look, will you do somethin' about that? I'm gonna tell him off like he's never been told before! Now, look here, Ralph, you've been ringing this phone all evening, and I'm getting pretty tired... You haven't? Are you sure? Well, somebody's been tryin' to get us, and I haven't answered! I thought it was you! ♪♪ Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy. Kitten! Bud! What's the matter? Where's Betty? Oh, hello. What happened to you? Oh, nothing happened to us. What happened to you? Hey, why are you home? Well, I... I tried to call here to let you know we got there all right, and there was no answer. I tried all evening. Why didn't you answer? Oh, Father, I thought it was Ralph. Oh, no! He was pestering me, and I told him that if he called again, I... Oh, I'm sorry. That's all right, Princess. Well, what're you and Mom gonna do now, Dad? Well, we'll settle this parents vacation thing once and for all. Gather around, kids. We're gonna have a family meeting. ♪♪ Feeling better about things now, honey? Much better. Come on, Betty! Our room is ready! You ought to see the view from our room. Good night, dear. Good night, Dad. Good night, dear. Good night, Son. Come, come. Come on. See ya. Mmm. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Ohh... Mmm... Uh-huh. Yes, dear.
