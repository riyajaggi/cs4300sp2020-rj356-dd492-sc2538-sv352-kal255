 Robert Young... and Jane Wyatt. With Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray, and Lauren Chapin... Look out! Hi, everybody. Hi, Daddy! Bye, Daddy! Whoa! Remember me? Sure, Daddy. I could never forget you. How about a kiss to pay for your room and board and laundry? Okay, paid.

 Hello, honey. What's burning? I am. Hello, dear. Oh, cornbread. It's a cake. Is it a pancake? It's a birthday cake. I mean, well, at this point, I really don't know myself. Mother! Mother, have you seen my... Oh, hi, Father. Hi, Princess. Father, before you say another word, I want you to answer just one question,

 and I want the truth. Am I getting fat? All I can say is there's never too much of a good thing. Oh, no! What did I say? In simple language, you told her that she was growing into a hippopotamus. I said that? Ralph said she's gaining weight. Oh. Why doesn't he mind his own business? What can I do with it? Aren't you home early? Yes, and you'll see why. There's something I want to show you. What? Out in the driveway. Something I bought for Bud. Something he's always wanted. It's probably something you want and never been able to have. Good heavens! How do you like it? Kathy! Good gracious, get her off of that! I can't see her! Kathy! Let me go! I told you not to touch things! Is she all right? A little oily, but otherwise sound. Kathy, go upstairs and put on a clean dress. I just put this one on. It's clean except for the dirt. Go on with you. Gosh, Father. Where did you get this? That's exactly what I'd like to know. I bought it, secondhand. But, darling, we've got a perfectly good car. Why, you look ridiculous riding around in a thing like that. It's not for me. It's for Bud. Bud? You mean that... You're going to give a dangerous toy like that to a boy Bud's age? Margaret, it's not dangerous, and it's not a toy. Look at me. I rode it home from the office, and not one broken bone. Gee! This is really something! You're not going to give that to Bud. He's not ready for it. But, Margaret, the boy has to grow up. Not on that thing he doesn't. Well, I got a terrific bargain. One of the boys at the club put it up for sale, and with a little careful manipulating, I got it for a price. How much? Well, I talked him down to $50. $50? $50? Reading from left to right, yes, $50. I could've bought all new curtains for upstairs. And I could've taken Dr. Bixley's reducing course. And I could've gotten some new golf clubs, but it happened that I bought Bud a motor scooter instead, and that's that. I'm not going to let you give it to him, Jim. But, Margaret, the boy has to have responsibility. Bud doesn't know the meaning of responsibility. He's a child. Betty, go upstairs and get ready for dinner. I want to hear who comes out ahead. Betty! Margaret, you haven't heard the best part of the whole deal. Mmm... yes? I put a fast one over on Fred Hartley. He wanted it for his kid. But I outsmarted him. By $50. Well, you know how Fred is, always bragging about getting a bargain on everything. I took it right out from under his nose. It's nearly killing him. Well, it's not going to kill Bud. You can sell it right back, and that's that. Now, Betty. Okay, now I know the ending. I'll get ready for dinner. If the poor kid sees it and then we tell him he can't have it, it'll break his heart. He doesn't have to see it. Now, quick, Jim. Hide that thing. Bud will be back any minute. Hide it where? Right in the garage, and then throw something over it. Throw what over it? Oh, Jim, you're stalling just so he'll see it. Now hurry up. Poor Bud. He and I could've had a lot of fun with this thing. Jim, are you sure you hid it carefully? Under two blankets, a piece of canvas, and the lawnmower. Margaret, I'm making one last appeal. The appeal is denied. The answer is no, and it's going back in the morning. Betty, is it polite to read at the table? There's no use my even sitting down. All I'm having is a piece of lettuce. Rabbits get fat on lettuce. Ha ha ha. Betty's a rabbit. Kathy, be quiet. And wait for the rest. Sorry I'm late. Say, you should've been with me. Claude Messner's homing pigeon never came home. Hi, Dad. Hello, son. Well, were you out today on your broken-down old bike? No, I loaned it to Joe Phillips to deliver his papers. Oh. Say, Dad, have you thought any more about getting me a motor scooter? Why, yes, I... Uh, that is, I've thought about it a little. Bud, eat your dinner, and don't worry your father about motor scooters. Okay. But if I had one, I could get a lot of extra jobs around like delivering and stuff. You see, Margaret? ♪ I know a secret, I know a secret ♪ Kathy! What were you going to say, Kitten? I can't tell. Well, that's a new twist. I got it! Why, it's miraculous! What is? This is a book on handwriting analysis, and I just analyzed yours, and it actually works. How did I do? Well, the curly-Qs on your R's show that you have a B+ personality. Just B+? Maybe I can work up to an A if I watch my curly-Qs. What's a curly-Q? Eat. If I eat, will I find out? According to Professor Stein, B+ is far above average. That's me. I'll read on. This is fascinating. Bud. What is it, shrimp? Will you do me a favor after dinner? What kind of a favor? Get my roller skates. Well, you're not going roller skating. It will be too late. I don't want to skate. Can't I just have 'em? Let her have them, Margaret. Well, all right. Where are they? Out in the garage. Bud, get your sister's skates. Bud! Stay right where you are. They'll be no roller skating after dinner, young lady. Listen! Your handwriting reveals that you are the type who rules this family with an iron hand and always gets his way. Betty. What? The professor who wrote that book must be a bachelor. Take it back. Janie has just got to see this book! Gee, that was a good dinner. You're the best cook in the whole world. Thank you, dear. Mommy, why do little girls play house? Because... Well, it's instinctive with them. What's that? It... Jim, explain it to her. Huh? Well, Kathy asked me why little girls play house. I said it was instinctive. Explain to her what instinctive means. Well, uh, instinct is something that, um, comes naturally. There. That explain it? Why don't little boys play house? That's a silly question. I think it's a very intelligent question. What's so all-fired intelligent about it? It sounds a little ridiculous to me. Jim! Well, to tell you the truth, Margaret, I've never delved into this subject. Do you know why little boys don't play house? Well, it... Kathy, time for you to go to bed. All right. Good night, Daddy. Good night, sweetheart. Sleep tight and don't forget to say your prayers. Could I ask for a scooter? Kathy! Uh, your mother handles the scooter department. I'm off to bed, Bud. Look! Chug-chug-chug-chug! Beep-beep! Kathy! Chug-chug-chug-chug! Beep-beep! Jim. Hmm? Oh, I just... Darling... the children are all upstairs in their rooms. Now's the time for you to call Fred Hartley and let him have the scooter. Oh, honey, I just want you to take a look at this thing. Did you ever see such a neat little machine? Look at that strong brake and this nice seat cushion. And the taillight. You know, taillights add to safety for night driving. And this honey of an engine. Imagine, one little harmless cylinder. One little piston. One little sparkplug. And one little item that you've completely overlooked. It's not for an irresponsible boy. Oh, Margaret, it's a harmless little machine. It's a two-wheel accident looking for a place to happen. I won't be persuaded, Jim. You get on it, Margaret. See for yourself. Now, you get away from me, Jim. Aw, come on. Jim! Go right in the house and phone Fred Hartley. Margaret. I can't understand you. Before we were married, you used to ride on the handlebars of my bike. Now you won't even sit on a scooter. Before a girl is married, she has to take a lot of chances that are no longer necessary afterwards. You mean you didn't enjoy it? If you will take time to study the construction of a handlebar, you will hardly find it conducive to a girl's, um, comfort. Why didn't you ever tell me? Well, we, um, didn't know each other that well then. I never had any idea what you went through to capture me. Tell me more. Actually, this is completely off the subject. Now, Jim, we're going to go in that house, and you're going to call Fred Hartley. No, no, no. You stop that, Jim! Now, you cover that thing up so that Bud can't see it. I'm going to get Fred on the phone. Margaret, I'll feel like a fool asking Fred Hartley to buy it after I outsmarted him. Hello, Fred? Well, this is Margaret Anderson. Fine, thank you. Uh, Fred, Jim wants to talk to you. Can't we put this off until... All right. Hi, Fred. You got a nerve calling after the dirty trick you played on me today. Ha ha. Just a little manipulating, Fred. In fact, that's what I'm calling about. If you're calling to rub it in, you can hang up. Oh, just the opposite, Fred, old man. I... I got a twinge of conscience knowing how much you wanted it for that boy of yours. Cut the malarkey. So what? I'm going to let you have the scooter, Fred, old boy. What happened? Did it fall apart? No, it didn't fall apart. I just realized it was a selfish move, and you can have it for just what I paid for it: $50. I'll give you 40. But I paid $50! Hard cash! Have you seen my handwriting book? Shh! Fred, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll split the difference with you: $45. How do you like that? I'm doing him a favor, and he wants to haggle. Father, have you seen that paper I had? Oh, Betty, I'm telephoning. Fred, listen to me. $40. Take it or leave it. 42.50, and that's my last offer. How much does he want to pay? $40. Can't anybody leave anything around this house without disappearing? Betty. How much did you say? $40. It's a deal. No, Fred, I was talking... Fred! Fred! The shark hung up on 40. Well, that's better than losing $50, and I'm happy it's all settled. There it is! Good night again. Betty. Yes, Father? Analyze my handwriting again and see if shows I'm a shrewd operator who drives a hard bargain. I don't have to analyze your handwriting. It's written all over your face. You're just wonderful. Mm. Mother, how does it look? Well! Betty! Isn't that a little extreme for dinner with the family? I'm just trying it on for tonight. How is it? Betty, I think it's a little too, uh... Uh, well, too. Well, it's supposed to be. Do you think Harvey will like it? Frankly, there isn't enough to dislike. I don't seem to remember that dress, dear. Jane's aunt loaned it to me. She's so sophisticated! Betty, I don't think it's exactly for you. You know, I think it's a little too old. Mother! Well, I do. How old is Harvey? 19. Then I think it's too old for him, too. Mother, Harvey's quite sophisticated. Margaret, wherefore art thou? In here, dear. I don't think your father's going to like it. Hi, honey. Oh, how do you do? I didn't mean to... Betty! Do you like it, Dad? Tell me the truth. I'll tell you the truth, all right. Where do you think you're going in that? I've got a date tonight, dancing. Then you better put a turtleneck sweater over it. Father, don't be so rectangular! Margaret, are you going to let her leave the house in that thing? Well, I don't especially like it. Maybe you'll loan me the bloomers and midi-blouse you wore when you were a girl. Well, your mother looked pretty good to me. Father! But this is the 20th Century! Margaret, do I seem old-fashioned to you? Not in the least. Do I to you? No. Then that probably means that we both are and don't recognize it. All right. What's for dinner? By the way, did you take care of that motor scooter? Oh, don't mention it. It nearly broke my heart to let that chiseler have it. Oh, Jim, you only lost $10. I can't help thinking how Bud would have loved having it. Well, what he doesn't know won't hurt him. I'll have to make it up to him some other way, I guess, just to ease my conscience. Well, I'll get ready for dinner. I'm starved. Mom! Oh, hi, Dad. Hello, son. Mom, how long before dinner? Ready in about a half hour. Okay. Bud! Yeah, Dad? Wait a minute, son, I want to talk to you. What did I do? Nothing. This is something between you and me. Here. I want you to have this. Money! $20. I can't believe it. What's the catch? Bud, sometimes your parents want to give you things, but we feel you're not grown up enough... You know, responsible enough. You mean I don't have to wash the car or clean the cellars for the next ten years? No strings. I don't know how to thank you, Dad. You can thank us, Bud. Just prove you know the meaning of responsibility by the way you handle this money. Gee! Well, how's my little ball of fluff tonight? Daddy, what did you give Bud? Bud? Oh, just some money. What for? Well, it's sort of a secret. A real secret? Here's a bright, shiny new dime for you. What do I have to do for it? Nothing. What am I around here, Simon Legree? You're a wonderful daddy. Morning, Daddy. Good morning, Kitten. Daddy, do you make as much money on Saturdays when you don't work as you do on Thursdays when you do work? Well, let's just say I don't lose any. Daddy, how much money did you give Bud yesterday? That's between Bud and me. Besides, didn't I give you a dime? A water pistol costs a quarter. All right. Here. It's a shakedown. I didn't ask you for it! Oh! Kathy. Oh, it's good having you home Saturday morning, darling. Makes the weekend seem longer. Better than that, it makes the weekdays seem shorter. I wish I could manage it every Saturday. Mmm! Have you already eaten? Ages ago. Bud was up and out before breakfast. Well, that's not unusual. For Bud to go without breakfast? Jim, you shouldn't have given him all that money yesterday. How did you know? Bud told me. Why? Does it have to be a secret? No, not actually. But tell me one thing. Did Kathy know you knew about the money? Well, she was right here when Bud mentioned it. Why? Nothing. I just hope she remembers us if she ever decides to hijack Fort Knox. Mom! Dad! I got a surprise for you! You won't believe it! Won't believe what? Out in the driveway! Come on, look at it! Wait a minute. I haven't finished my breakfast yet. What's going on here anyway? Oh, no! The scooter! Ain't it a knockout? Right in the solar plexus. So you did give it to him and lied about the whole thing! I don't know any more about it than you do. Dad didn't give it to me, Mom. Mr. Hartman bought it for his son Freddie. Only Freddie's mother said no. Can you imagine a goofy mother like that? Your mother has an excellent imagination. Go on. Well, you know that $20 you gave me? Mm-hmm. I sold my old bike to Joe Baker for 10 and put it with the 20 and bought the scooter. You bought that for $30 from Fred Hartley? Well, if he wasn't there, I think I could've got it from Mrs. Hartley for nothing! Oh, gee, honey, you'll have to admit Bud deserves it. Anyone who can trim Fred Hartley... Look at it, dear. No one can get hurt on it. What's the matter? Well, Bud, I think your mother doesn't approve of the scooter. She's afraid it might be too dangerous. Gee, Mom. I'm not a kid. You can't mean it. Bud, will you promise your mother to be extra careful while riding it? Well of course I'll be extra careful, Mom. I even stopped off at the police station and got this book on safety rules. You know, that isn't a toy. It isn't? Well, of course not, Mom. A motor job like that's a responsibility, almost like a car. Bud, that's the first time I ever heard you use the word responsibility in connection with yourself. Go ahead and keep it. I'm sure you'll be safe with it. Gee, Mom, you're great. Go ahead and say it. Okay. Gee, Mom, you're great. Be careful! Straighten it up! That's it! Fine. Now this way! Woo! Ooh! Oh, dear. That was fun! I want to be next! I want to be next! Ah, Father's next! My motor scooter. Now be careful! And don't speed! Look out for the trucks! Don't worry! You think I'll ever get a chance to ride it? Why, of course, son. It's yours, isn't it?
