 Robert Young and Jane Wyatt, with Elinor Donahue, Billy Gray and Lauren Chapin... Mother and junior members of the Anderson household. As you well know, the most important football game of the year takes place tomorrow afternoon. This year, your mother has declined to go. Therefore, I am in a position to invite one of you to be my guest and companion at tomorrow's game. Oh, how completely divine!

 What a bomb! Kathy, aren't you excited? Sure! What time do we go? You may not be the lucky one, Kathy. What are we going to do? Draw straws? Oh, how perfectly infantile. Now, now, now. We're going to have a legitimate contest. I want each one of you to tell me, in 25 words or less, why you should be the one to go to the game. Your mother will be the sole judge, and her decision will be final. All right, we'll start with, um, the youngest, Miss Kathleen Anderson.

 I think I should go to the football game because I'm the youngest. And the youngest is usually spoiled. And I'm not spoiled. But I will be if I don't get to go. Mommy, do I get to go? Uh-uh. Don't try to influence the judge. I don't know, dear. But if you don't, we'll have fun right here. All right, Bud. You're next. I think I should get to go to the football game, because someday I intend to play football, and if I don't get to see a big game, how am I gonna learn? That's a pretty logical reason, I think. Uh-uh. Don't try to influence the judge. Betty? I think I should go to the game because... I adore football. I adore the wholesome sportsmanship of the game. And I adore the handsome, distinguished man who will act as my escort... My father. Hmm. That's pretty good, Margaret. She used 26 words! Well, cut out "handsome"! Don't you dare. Cut out the word "and". Mother, do I get to go? Well, I'll make my decision as soon as I can get some attention. Sorry, judge. Children... and their father, I hereby decide in favor of... Betty. Oh, Father! Oh, Mother. Oh, goobers. Now, now. Let's not be bitter. Now, the real reason I chose Betty is that she's been such a help to me this last week. She's cleaned out the closets, done the mending, polished the silver... Oh, thank you, Mother! Oh, is this excruciatingly wonderful! Gee whiz. She gets to go to everything. Gee whiz. I don't get to go anywhere. Gee whiz. Yes, you do. Besides, you can listen to it on the radio. Radio? Can't get any hot dogs. Sorry, old man. I'm leaving the office in 10 minutes. I'm taking my daughter to the big game. Not a chance. Business can wait until Monday. Uh-uh. I wouldn't miss this game for anything in the world. No, I'll talk to you on Monday. Yeah. Good-bye. ♪♪ Jim, am I glad I found you in. Bob Harris! I didn't know you were back in town. Just got in this morning for the big game. Are you going, too? Great! Yeah, great. Before I left, I gave my fool girl specific instructions to get me two tickets. She forgot. How do you like it? Two long weeks with nothing to do, and she forgot. Gee, Bob. That's too bad. Too bad? Why, it's criminal! I've turned this town upside down! I can't get one ticket! Do you know what that means? I'm going to miss the game for the first time in 17 years. Well, Bob, I wish I could help you, but... That's why I'm here, Jim. You've never missed a game, either. You know what it means. There must be somebody you know who has an extra ticket. Oh, I wish I'd known about this yesterday, Bob. I had an extra ticket, but I promised to take Betty. Betty? Does she have to go? What does football mean to Betty? Now, wait a minute... She's young. There'll be other football games for her. As for me, why, who knows? I might go... like that. Tomorrow. Well, look, Bob. This is a big thing for my daughter. It isn't just the game. It's me. The thrill of me escorting her. I've never known you to be a fool, Jim. Huh? You're a pretty good businessman. I don't speculate in football tickets. How about endowment policies? Twenty-thousand dollar endowment policies. What about it? You've been trying to sell me a policy for a long time now. I kept putting it off. Well, I... I might be interested in buying one. Now. The endowment policy, of course, would... Would be only a start. It could mean group insurance for my entire plant. We could talk it over... between halves? Meet me at the west entrance of the stadium at 1:15. Betty? I'm all ready, Father! Mother! We're going! Have a good time! Here we go! No, Betty. Wait. What is it, Father? Well, I, uh, wanna talk to you for a minute. Is anything wrong? Well, no. No. There's nothing wrong. I... I was just doing a little thinking this morning, and, well, after all, you are a young girl, and you'd much rather be with young people, and, well, I'm old enough to be your father, and... Father? I've hurt you, haven't I? Huh? Well, I must have hurt you at some time or another, and... I wouldn't hurt you for anybody or anything. Oh. Well, look, Betty. Bob Harris came in my office this morn... You're the best father anybody ever had. Thank you, Betty. But... I'd rather go to the game with you than anybody else in the whole world. You would? Oh, yes, Father. Uh, sit down, Princess. I... I wanna talk to you for a minute. Um... Honey, you... you know that I love you, don't you? Well, of course. And I, uh... I've always tried to please you, haven't I? Oh, you're cute. Betty, you're a big girl now, and one of these days in the not-too-distant future, you'll be married and have a family of your own... Oh, Father. Are we gonna have another talk on biology? Betty, you know that I'm in the insurance business. You know that there isn't anything in the world I wouldn't do for my family. I don't have to tell you how competitive my business is... Excuse me, Father. What time is it? A little after 12:30. Now... Don't you think we should get going? Betty... Betty, I'm going to the game with Bob Harris. But... But you and Mother said... I know, honey. But this is a matter of business. I have to take Bob Harris. But you said I could go with you! I was counting on it! Honey, you're just making it more difficult. Jim! Father doesn't want to take me to the game! That's not true at all, Betty! I promised to take Bob Harris. I have a chance to sell him an endowment policy. You know those things don't grow on trees! He doesn't want to take me to the game! I give up. Now, Jim, you realize, of course, that you can't do this to Betty. Well, nobody thinks about me around here. You must never break a promise to a child, Daddy. You, too, Kathy? I saw the same situation in a movie, Dad. Yeah? How'd it turn out? They shot the guy for being a welcher. Too bad we don't have any loose revolvers around the house. I can see the whole family taking potshots at me. I have a water pistol, Daddy. Thank you, Annie Oakley. Dear, you made a promise. You've got to keep it. I also made a promise to Bob Harris. Well, then, you've got to keep that one, too. Oh, Margaret, stop talking in circles. I only have two tickets, so how can Bob Harris go and Betty go if... Oh. You mean... That's exactly what I mean. Then I can't go? Well, you can listen to it on the radio with Bud and Kathy. The radio. You can't get any hot dogs. How can I sell Bob Harris a policy? You'll find a way, dear. Now, where were you supposed to meet Mr. Harris? The west gate at 1:15. Betty, you don't mind going with Mr. Harris, do you? Oh, no, Mother! Of course not! He's so distinguished-looking! Frivolous Sal. Jim, give Betty the tickets. Margaret, you need a new dress. You said so last week. I'll buy it for you. And... And I'll get a new dress for Betty, too. What about me? And a new dress for Kathy. What do I get? And a new dress for Bud! What? I-I mean a pair of slacks. And I'll get you those new slipcovers you've wanted for so long. Remember? Jim, where are the tickets? On the 50-yard line. I mean, uh, upstairs in the pocket of my blue shirt. Oh, Father. Not the... the blue shirt? Yes, the tickets are in the pocket of the shirt that's hanging... What's the matter? Oh, Jim! I sent that shirt to the laundry! Nope. Didn't come in yet. But he picked up the bundle three hours ago! He's a new man. Don't know the route good. Why do you put on a new man at a time like this? Because the regular driver took off to go to the football game. What time is it? 12:45. No, it isn't. It's 12:50. So why did you ask me? I'm nervous! What time is it now? Your time or my time? Never mind. Oh, Bob Harris will never forgive me. The game's probably started by now. Car 27's unloaded. This is Mr. Anderson. He wants to look at his laundry. Right! Come on! Which one is mine? Start looking. Your name's on it. Well, aren't you gonna help me? Sure. Of all the stupid, idiotic, asinine... Who? Oh, not you. Think there'd be some kind of alphabetical order to this. Oh, here it is. Such carelessness to leave a bag open this way. Oh. I thought the shirt was gone. They're gone! Somebody took them! Took what? The tickets! I had two tickets in the pocket of this shirt! The laundry bag was open! Well, don't look at me. I'm not accusing anyone. I don't need your football tickets. How did you know they were football tickets? 'Cause the opera season ain't open, the baseball season's too far off, and today happens to be the day of the big game. Now, do you wanna make something out of it? No. No. Well, maybe we can do business. I got a couple of duckets I don't think I'm gonna use. Oh, you don't. Give 'em to you for a price. You will. Good seats. On the 50-yard line. The 50-yard line. Twenty bucks. $20? Apiece? No, for the pa... Hey, what do you think I am, a crook? Okay. You're a good guy to do business with. Yeah. Hey! Help me put the bags back. I'm in a hurry. So am I. I didn't eat yet. Just pile 'em in the corner. $20! The unmitigated nerve of the guy! Is that you, dear? Yes, it's me. Where's Betty? The silliest thing just happened. A few minutes ago... Well, Jim! Margaret, as long as you live, you're never to give another piece of laundry to that gang of crooks! Oh, what happened? They sold me back my own tickets. That's what they did. Oh, but, dear, that's impossible. Oh, it is, is it? What does this look like? The driver sold them back to me for $20! Then you... you lost your temper and got into a fight. No. I got hit in the eye with a laundry bag. Margaret, I want you to write them a letter... Now, Jim, you're just working yourself up for nothing. It isn't for nothing. It's for a principle. Men have died for a principle. Well, you better start dying. We found the tickets on the dresser. Oh, you did. I suppose you're gonna take the word of... On the dresser? Betty found it on the dresser. Right where you left them! And she's on the way to the game right now. I left them on the dresser? And you'd better apologize to that driver for even thinking that he took your tickets. Oh, I will. I will. I'll tell him how sorry I am I got my eye in the way of his laundry bag. Jim, I've never seen you with a shiner. You look so rugged. Thank you, dear. I'll wear one more often. Probably get there by the end of the first quarter. See you later. Now, wait a minute. You bought two tickets. What are you gonna do with the extra one? Hold everything! Don't anybody make a move! What about that extra ticket, Dad? Can... Wow. What a beautiful mouse. All right. I don't expect any sympathy from my son. What about that extra ticket, Daddy? What are you doing over there? I fell asleep. But I woke up in time to hear about the laundry bags. Kathy, you should never eavesdrop. I know it. But it was fun. Now do we have another contest to see who goes? Oh, no. We're not gonna go through that again. This time, you have to make your own decision. Which one will it be? Hurry up! We're missing some touchdowns! Take Kathy. Good. Come on, Kathy. No. Take Bud. All right. Let's go, Bud. Kathy should go. She's the youngest. No, Bud should go because he's a boy. Keep out of this, squirt. I know you wanna go. I do not! You do, too! I do not! You do... Time! Do you mind if I go? I know a way we could all go. This year or next? She's just a crazy, mixed-up kid. Bill Lawrence has a student ticket, and he can't go. That's right! I was just talking to Mrs. Lawrence on the phone, and Bill is sick in bed. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! What a break! Sweet and tender. You can always depend on me. Bud, ride Kathy over to the stadium on your bicycle. I'll drive over to the Lawrence's and pick up the ticket. Margaret, will you call Bill and tell him I'm dropping by? Don't you think it'd be better if Bud picked up the ticket? Oh, no. I'm in charge of this operation. Okay. All right. I suppose Father knows best. Who is it? Hi, Bill. It's me, Jim Anderson. Oh, hi, Mr. Anderson. Come on in. I thought maybe it was my kid sister. She's been making my life miserable. Ah, I can't get this darn radio working. Uh, how do you feel? Horrible. Well, that flu really gets you down. Are you kidding? Ugh. Aren't you a little old for the measles? You're never too old for anything. My buddy has the colic. Yeah, I-I guess you're right. Did Mrs. Anderson call you about that ticket? Oh. Oh, yeah. It's in my blue suit. In the closet. All right. He breaks to his left half, flips the ball to right and... Are you sure it's in the blue suit? Uh, try the brown one. The 20, 25, the 30, the 35, the 40, the 45, the 50, the 45, the 40, the 35, Go! Go! Go! The 20 the 15! But there's a handkerchief on the play. Wasn't in the brown suit. Try the gray suit. When I went to college, all I had was a sweater and a pair of knickers. The ball is handed to the tailback, Guginugilof. Guginugilof moves toward the middle of the line, hands off to the quarterback, Fopsinocherist. He laterals to fullback, Smith. He's in the clear! The 15! The 20! The 25! The 30! The 35! Go! Go! Go! Keep going! That's it! He's going all the way! What a play! What a play! - He's over for a touchdown! - Listen to that crowd! Wait. There's a handkerchief on the play. It isn't in the gray suit. Try the red suit. You've got a red suit? I'm a freshman. They make me wear it. On Christmas. Every Monday. I'll try the red suit. There goes the gun that ends the first quarter. Go! Go! Go! The end of the first quarter. The red suit has no pockets. Oh, that's right. I forgot. How can anybody forget a red suit without pockets? It's not easy. Bill, think. What did you do with that ticket? I can't understand it. I know I put the ticket in one of my suits. Bill, you can't do this to me. I've never missed one of these games. It's my school! And more than that, I have a very important appointment between halves. Think! Think! Did you ever see such a stupid radio? Bill! Huh? The ticket. Oh. Uh... Wait a minute. Yes, Bill? Oh, Mother, do you know what I did with my football ticket? You left it in your blue shirt. Everybody leaves football tickets in blue shirts. Do you have it, Mother? No. I sent it to the laundry. Oh, no. But I gave the ticket to the doctor. Oh, no! Thank you, Mother. Good-bye. Good-bye. Don't forget your medicine. I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Anderson. But you stick around. I'll have the radio fixed in no time. Thanks, Bill. I, uh, have several radios at home. Yes, Mother? If Mr. Anderson wants to go to the game, Tom Heckendorn isn't using his student ticket. Gee, I forgot about him. Ed Heckendorn's son. He lives just down the block. Thanks, Bill, for all your trouble. Thanks, Mrs. Lawrence! I'll stop by there! So long, Bill. Oh, Mr. Anderson? Yes, Mrs. Lawrence? Don't get too close to Tom Heckendorn. He's got the mumps. ♪♪ Well, here you are, Bud! Thanks. My, aren't they good! Would you care for another one, Kathy? No, thank you. I already had two. When does the second half start? In about five minutes. Boy, what a game! Are you enjoying it, Kathy? Oh, yes. I could see it over again. Mr. Harris, I'm beginning to worry about Father. Oh, there's nothing to worry about. I'm just sorry he missed the first half. He was so anxious to see the game. Mr. Harris? Yes, Kathy? What's an endowment policy? Oh, well, it's nothing to interest a little girl on a... A beautiful day like this. Especially at a football game. Gosh, you don't suppose anything's happened to Father, do you? Why, of course not. He's probably in the locker room talking to the coach. Frenchy! I thought I told you I wanted it loud and clear! What's the matter? Can't you yell? I distinctly said, "Rah, rah, rah." Yeah, it was a great game. I think. I was sitting in the cheering section. Am I stiff. Well, thanks for calling. I'll see you Monday. Yeah. Good-bye. Hello, Kitten! Come to feed the invalid, huh? Yeah. Do you have the measles? No. Of course not. The mumps? No. I had all those things when I was a kid. Then what do you have now? Nothing. I gave one little sneeze, and your mother insisted I go to bed. Sounds awful familiar. Ah, that looks good. Well, Kathy, did you have fun at the game? Yes. And I enjoyed Mr. Harris. I made him tell me all about endowment policies. Mr. Harris? Oh, Kathy. Why did you have to bother him? If you wanted to know about endowments, why didn't you ask me? I know more about them than he does. So do I. So I sold him a policy. He said he'd give you a check on Monday. Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services, Inc.
