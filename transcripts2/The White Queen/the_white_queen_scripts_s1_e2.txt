 The White Queen (2013): Season 1, Episode 2 - The Price of Power - full transcript 
 The pregnant Elizabeth is crowned queen and welcomed by Edward's brothers Richard and George though Warwick and his daughters do not disguise their disapproval and Cecily refuses to attend the coronation. Warwick is especially aggrieved that the king is neglecting a peace treaty with France and entertaining the Duke of Burgundy,a relation of Elizabeth and enemy to the French king. As it becomes clear that Warwick intends to make himself powerful Edward gives key posts at court to Baron Rivers and his sons,which also enrages Margaret Beaufort,whose young son Henry Tudor has had to forfeit a title to the Rivers family. Margaret is also angry when Warwick captures the deposed fugitive former king Henry and Edward imprisons him. As a reward Warwick asks that his daughters are betrothed to the king's brothers but the request is denied. When Elizabeth gives birth to a daughter,rather than an heir,Warwick is delighted and organizes a rebellion,incarcerating Edward,Elizabeth and Jacquetta and killing Rivers and his sons,putting George forward as his new protégé. Elizabeth swears vengeance in blood.

 You are a girl
from the House of Lancaster,
 and you live in a country
that is divided.
 You may not fall in love
with a York king
 unless there is some profit in it
for you.
 Will you marry me?
 Yes.
 Warwick is the Kingmaker,
 you can be very sure
he will make the queen as well.
 She's my queen of choice and I...
Of choice?! Have you gone mad?
 He is a pretender.
He has taken the throne by force.
 He is the king and those who speak
against him are guilty of treason.
 Now, let us make a son,
to scotch the Lancastrian threat.
 It is an honour to meet you,
Duchess Cecily.
 I am not happy about this marriage.
 I could put his brother, George,
upon the throne in his place.
 The King has done
what he should not.
 Elizabeth.
 There are many who will be cursing
our luck and wishing us to fall.
 So, our new queen
is not only Lancastrian
 but now we have
half of Burgundy out in force.
 Why?
 Because she is related to them!
 But, Issy, we like her better
than the old bad queen, don't we?
 And now we must crown her
before her belly grows too fat.
 Elizabeth.
 Are you afraid?
 Edward will help me know what to do.
 They say the whole of London
will be out.
 Except one.
 Edward's mother has refused to come.
 I don't think you'll miss her.
 It's one less foot to trip me up!
 Lord Warwick.
 Is the woman dressed and ready?
 She's not made queen yet.
 My new sister.
 You're as beautiful
as a queen should be.
 I pray your child is a son, so he
may follow my brother on his throne.
 Thank you, Richard. George.
 I am very grateful for your kinship.
 Where... Where's Edward?
 At the Abbey.
 He is to watch the coronation from
behind a screen, as is the custom.
 My daughters will escort you.
 They have been trained
for such occasions.
 The Queen has her own sisters
to attend her.
 Your daughters may join
in the procession behind us.
 Hold your head high, Elizabeth.
 God has chosen you in this
 and your brothers and I will be
with you every step of the way.
 But now, you are holding my arm
too tightly and I may faint.
 You may not faint
because I need you.
 You will always be my Elizabeth.
 I am so very proud of you.
 Anne, you goose!
Stop staring like an idiot!
 She is so beautiful.
 Yes, but the King should have
married the French princess
 as Father had arranged.
 Just play your part.
 It will not be for very long.
 God save the Queen!
 Elizabeth!
 Elizabeth!
 That isn't mother.
 It's her, Richard.
 She's just in her coronation robes,
that's all. Oh.
 I here present unto you, Queen
Elizabeth, your undoubted queen.
 Wherefore, all you
who are come this day
 to do your homage and service,
 are you willing to do the same?
 God save the Queen!
 Let the anointing of this oil
 increase your honour
 and establish you for ever.
 God save the Queen!
 We offer up the sceptres
and the ring,
 to our one and mighty queen.
 God save the Queen!
 Mother! Mother!
 Oh, my boys!
 Are you Queen now, Mother?
 Yes, Richard. But before that,
I shall always be your mother.
 May we sit with you at dinner?
 I'm sorry, not today.
 But later, I shall come and
see you both to bed myself.
 Queen Elizabeth?
 Your court awaits.
 You all look so very similar,
you Rivers girls.
 You look like beautiful fish!
 I'm not sure I should like to be
a fish! Hello.
 George does try to be so charming
but he doesn't always get it right!
 Last time we saw you, Richard,
 you fell off your horse at our
father's castle, do you remember?
 Our father taught King Edward
and put him on the throne
 and so now, King Edward must...
 What?
 So he did,
and Edward loves him for it.
 There's a seat here, Anne,
if you'd like it.
 Lords and Ladies of the court,
 Queen Elizabeth of England.
 I did not think
it would be this grand, Edward.
 It is to silence those who say
that our marriage is not valid.
 Who?! Who says that it is not?
 Ah!
 Your mother?
 The people were denied
a royal wedding.
 And so we have given them
 a coronation
worthy of the Lord himself.
 She does not even know
how to behave!
 How would you behave
if you were queen?
 Not like that!
 I would not whisper with the King!
 I would be a queen of stone.
 I would have dignity and no emotion.
 She doesn't even seem ashamed!
 Desperate for this banquet
to end...
 Edward, you must attend
to the peace treaty with France.
 I have kept it from your door
this week as much as I could but,
 now that Charles of Burgundy
has been befriended
 and France has been left out,
 it cannot wait.
 I will attend to it tomorrow.
 But now, cousin, feast with us,
 for we have won everything
that we set out to
 and I wish to see you happy.
 How is it that I've allowed you
to wear so many clothes?
 I cannot think.
 What's the point of being king if I
cannot keep you naked all day long?
 We shall have to change
this room, Edward.
 It's too odd to have
Margaret of Anjou's things about us.
 Change it as you wish.
 Shall we be safe, you and I,
upon our thrones?
 While Henry is at large,
there's always a chance
 of a Lancastrian uprising to put him
back on the throne.
 Or his son, Edward.
 But when we have our son, we will be
safe, for we will have an heir.
 And your own men, do you trust them?
 Lord Warwick?
 Him of all.
 I know he's brusque and has found it
hard to deal with our marriage
 but he will learn
to love you as I do.
 He already does.
 You should ask his girls
to be your ladies!
 Make them your favourites.
It will please him.
 And his agreement with France?
Will you make that, too?
 I'll decide tomorrow...
 because now,
 I cannot think at all.
 Argh.
Now what am I to do with these?
 It's not as though Margaret of Anjou
will return for them.
 Mother!?
 I never thought it would be me
doing this.
 I was her closest friend,
when I was her lady at court.
 But these are different times.
 You are Queen of England now
 and you will never make
the same mistakes that she did.
 I cannot burn it
or they'll strangle us for witches.
 That is interesting, Baron Rivers.
 Your advice may well be
worth thinking about.
 We are here to serve you,
Your Grace.
 Edward?
 We'll meet soon.
 My lord.
 I've drafted out the terms
 of England's peace treaty
with France as discussed
 and the French Ambassador's
confirmed
 he will be able to attend the autumn
hunt, where both parties can sign.
 There's no hurry, Warwick.
 There are some other players
in the game who I may speak to.
 Other...?
 I've invited Burgundy, as well.
 You've invited the enemy of France?
 I wish for them
 to lift their restrictions
on the sale of English cloth,
 and they are
my wife's own relatives,
 so I can hardly leave them out.
 Lord Warwick?
 I know that I was not your choice
of wife and queen for Edward.
 But I hope that we may join in
friendship as we share love for him.
 You hope for that, Your Grace?
 And also that your daughters will
join my household as my ladies?
 Burn her.
 We'll have no truck with a queen
who thought to rule her husband
 and rule England through him.
 We've no need for scheming women.
 I know your loyalty to Warwick,
 but surely, if he's gone
this far already, Edward...
 Edward?
 Your father and brothers
have just told me
 that Warwick has a secret deal
with the King of France.
 Louis has promised him a territory
 in exchange
for my alliance with France.
 Now, this was once dependent upon me
marrying the Princess Bona
 but now rides upon this
so-called peace treaty.
 So, Warwick is plotting against you.
 Not so much against me
as... for himself.
 But he should not have
kept it from me.
 So I shall treaty with the side
I think is most useful.
 He does not see Warwick's danger.
Even now.
 He's clouded by how much
he loves him.
 Then you must do the thinking
for him.
 Warwick is against the King.
 He wants power for himself.
 Now, if Edward doesn't stop him,
then you must.
 Because otherwise, Warwick
will be king-making again.
 And this time it won't be
Edward's head that wears the crown.
 And then we all will be in danger.
 Come.
 Come on.
 Hup. Hup.
 Hup.
 Hup. Hup.
 Well done, John!
 He'll have a fight on his hands
against my brother, George.
 He has none of Richard's chivalry
and he doesn't like to lose.
 Burgundy's here, then.
 The Rivers run so deep,
any man could be drowned in them.
 My own mother's been washed away.
 You could do better?
 Edward, the French Ambassador's
feeling slighted
 in favour of Charles of Burgundy.
 Oh, cheer up, Warwick.
 The bigger threat
is still my cousin Henry.
 Lancaster will not give up
their hopes for him.
 While Henry is at large, there will
always be some army to support him.
 Charles has suggested
a marriage between himself
 and Margaret of York. He seems very
keen. Mother! Shhh. Not now.
 Your mother is right, Elizabeth.
 We must build a powerful
royal family around you
 to protect you,
and marriages are the way to...
 Well done, George!
 Good hunting, brother.
 As your prize, I shall
confer on you the title...
 Earl of Richmond!
 And I was hoping for your crown.
 Lady Margaret Beaufort
won't be happy.
 Richmond is her son's title!
 Yes. But he is nephew
to the old King Henry.
 So, I must strip it from him.
 They have stripped my son
of his title!
 They have stripped him
of "The Earl of Richmond"
 and given it to that second
York boy, George. I've been told.
 You are my husband,
you must get it back for him!
 It is his ancestral title
through his... Margaret.
 Margaret,
the Yorks rule England now,
 and Edward may give the peerages
to whoever he sees fit.
 Is it not enough that I am not
allowed to raise my child myself?
 That he must be raised
by his uncle Jasper?
 He is nephew to King Henry,
in line as Lancastrian heir.
 He should not be treated
as though...
 Look, you must not boast of this
too loudly, it is the very...
 It is the very reason
why the King must keep him down.
 His uncle Jasper
would not let this happen!
 He would write to Edward
and defend my poor boy!
 He would feel his pain, as I do!
 I shall go to little Henry myself
and explain to him about his title!
 No, it'll mean nothing to him.
The boy is barely five-years-old.
 It means something!
It means the world.
 It is all he has!
 Have you eaten anything today? No.
 You are looking very thin again.
I'm fasting.
 You cannot live on fresh air alone.
I live on prayer.
 And God shall give me sustenance.
 Lord Warwick?
 It's been four months,
 and your daughters
have not been brought to me.
 I requested them for my household.
 My daughters are to wed, Your Grace,
and so sadly, must decline.
 The King is aware.
 Ah.
 I was thinking,
 our little Annie
 should wed Viscount Bourchier.
 And little Katherine could marry the
Duke of Buckingham, Stafford's nephew?
 Warwick has refused his daughters
to me mother.
 It is a snub
and I do not know what I should do.
 He hates me.
 But Edward still thinks
we can be friends!
 Then what should I do?
 Accept his hate or battle through it?
 You should do neither.
 You should do as Edward says and
make your family strong by marriage,
 so you can weather an attack
from anyone.
 Now, your brother, John...
 What spells are you two weaving?
 Father!
 Ah, the goddess of love
is busy with her work, I see!
 There is no love in this, Richard.
Only business.
 You see how Mother changed her tune?
 When she set her heart on you,
the lowly squire,
 she caused quite the scandal,
saying true love was enough.
 It was worth it.
 For I have the most beautiful
lady in the kingdom.
 And I the handsomest, kindest,
most loving man.
 Who has just been made Treasurer!
 Richard! Then Warwick's uncle
has been set aside?
 Edward is unhappy with him
over France.
 And Anthony has
Admiralty of the Fleet
 and Lionel will be
Bishop as he's always wanted.
 Richard!
 Yes, yes.
 Go and fetch the midwife.
 I think our first York prince
wishes to join the world.
 That's it, come on, push.
 Push-push-push.
 That's it. That's it.
 Good girl, shh.
 Give him to me, Mary?
 Let me hold him.
 It's a girl.
 A little girl.
 Where is he?
The Queen is not ready.
 Let me see him! I am king.
You cannot keep me from my son.
 It's a girl, Edward.
 It's a girl.
 Mind the head. Take the head.
 She is a beautiful girl.
 We will love her very well.
 We shall have boys, Edward.
 Sons and heirs.
 They shall come. I know.
 You are so very lovely, Elizabeth.
I could not do without you.
 It's a girl!
 The Queen has had
a little baby girl for Edward.
 It makes little odds
that he has no heir
 when she has taken all the nobles
 and there's no-one left
for ours to wed.
 Ah, but...
 I have found
the biggest prize of all,
 and the King
 will give me anything I want for it.
 My Lady.
 Stafford.
 Lord Tudor.
 Are you well?
 We are in fine health.
 Shall we ride in?
 Jasper, how is my Henry?
 He's thriving.
You'll barely know him.
 Henry?
 Henry!
 Come to your mother.
 Come on, you must remember me?
 Go on, Henry.
 Lady Mother.
 Henry, I miss you very much
and I would have come sooner,
 but I have been made to live
very far away from you.
 It is punishment for my loyalties.
 Henry, the wicked York king,
has taken your title.
 But we will get it back for you.
We will.
 Do not fill his head with nonsense,
Margaret, he will not get it back!
 He should be playing in the sun
with other children,
 not cooped up here,
like some invalid!
 There are no families
of breeding near enough
 for a suitable companion.
Well, perhaps little Henry
 could show me the stables
and the horses while we're here?
 May I?
 Go on.
 Come now. Come and see our horses.
We have names for all of them.
 I expect you're a very good rider.
Yes.
 Tell me he is good to you?
 Tell me that, at least. He, er...
 I have an allowance.
 I, er...
 I buy books.
 I read the Gospel.
He's teaching me to read in Latin.
 I missed you, Margaret.
 More than I can tell. Don't.
 You must not.
 I've received a letter
from my brother.
 My nephew is to be betrothed
to the Queen's sister, Katherine,
 and we are called to London
for the wedding.
 This is the Queen
and her mother's wish.
 The Duke of Buckingham...
to a common country girl?!
 I will not go.
You will, Margaret.
 And you will be gracious.
 Your mother will be there.
It will be a chance to see her, too.
 You've not seen her
since we married.
 Shall we?
 In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.
 Amen.
 Look at my little sister, Katherine,
with her sulky new husband, the Duke.
 Who would have thought
so happy an occasion
 would have made so many
so miserable?!
 Lord Warwick isn't even here.
 So much the better.
 Congratulations, Your Grace,
on your first York princess.
 She is not a boy though,
so you have no heir.
 I shall have many more,
Duchess Cecily,
 and the next one shall be a boy.
 Edward? What is that?
 King Henry!
 My Lords. Our one time king, Henry,
and now, our prisoner.
 He was roaming
the fields of Northumberland
 but I have ridden out
and captured him.
 And you have brought him in!
No, Richard!
 Then let us take vengeance for our
father he murdered! You will not!
 He is an anointed king.
 And how should we be any better
if we match him in his butchery?
 He is a traitor
and an enemy to my rule.
 But God has brought him to us to
show that my reign is just and true.
 We shall keep cousin Henry
in the Tower apartments
 and show him a mercy
that he denied our father.
 Go in God, cousin.
 I'm once again indebted to you,
Warwick.
 I serve you, Edward, as ever.
 Might I have a word with Your Grace?
Of course.
 God bless him, poor Henry...
 Warwick is up to something, Mother.
 Can we ever trust him?
 Girls, I have something to tell you.
 You must keep it a secret for now.
Do you promise? Yes, Lady Mother.
 Your father is asking
King Edward for the royal dukes,
 his brothers, to be given
in marriage to the two of you.
 You will marry George.
And I shall have Richard!
 See how Anne is blushing!
 You cannot think to like him?
 He's got such funny eyes
and he's so serious.
 Stop it, Issy! She, of course,
will try to stop it.
 But the King will not refuse
your father,
 not if he asks him to his face.
 Not now, after bringing Henry in.
 And the two of you will
be royal duchesses.
 You will outrank
the King's own mother.
 I am to marry Richard.
 Your Grace.
 However could they bring poor
King Henry in like that?
 You must not call him "King",
my love. He is the king
in the eyes of God.
 They have sinned to
take his throne away from him!
 Complaining, Margaret?
Good evening to you, Lady Beauchamp.
 Lady Mother.
You know my son, don't you?
 Richard Welles
is Margaret's half-brother.
 He's my pride and joy.
 As my son would be
if you'd let me keep him with me.
 Ever the drama, Margaret.
..I see she has not changed at all.
 Ladies.
 Henry is my son! He is mine!
 And you have remarried.
A man I did not want to.
 A man you forced upon me.
A man I did not choose.
 Oh, Margaret. This again.
 You are a girl, you do not choose.
 You live the life
your mother chooses for you,
 or your husband does.
 Then why could you not
have chosen Jasper Tudor?
 Oh, I've seen your
puppy eyes for him
 since long before his brother
withered of the plague.
 Then why choose Stafford?
I thought he was a better match.
 And I do not care if you are happy.
 Hello.
 There were too many
commoners in there.
 And all of them want marriages.
 Isn't that what you want, Isabel?
 George.
Brother.
 Edward, there you are!
 So what did Lord Warwick want?
 My brothers for his girls.
For Isabel and Anne?
 I said I would think about it.
 Edward?
 If Warwick's daughters
are married to your brothers,
 they will share the biggest
fortune in the kingdom
 and have royal blood
upon both sides.
 Do you imagine they will not
come against you if you grant it?
 Damn it, Elizabeth!
Warwick is not the enemy.
 He is a friend
and I have disregarded him.
 And I am resolved to sign the treaty
with Burgundy against France...
 Shh. No! And it will be two years
of his life that have been wasted.
 I must give him something.
 Then give him something.
 But not this.
 You must show him you are
your own man, and king now.
 He may not grow too powerful
and come against you.
 You're right.
 Of course you are.
 Perhaps he won't mind so much.
 He's usually happy with more land.
 I could offer him more of Wales,
take it away from Jasper Tudor.
 Am I so bad
not even you may love me?
 Tell me of your plan for me?
 Tell me there is a purpose?
 Give me a sign, Lord.
 Tell me at least that my son
may have a destiny!
 Margaret? I've been
looking for you all night.
 What have you been do...
 Come on.
 We are leaving.
 Where's the Countess?
Your Grace.
 Bring her in here!
 But how?
 How could he refuse you?
 He promised they would be married.
 The King has lost his mind,
he's thinking with his breeches
 and all for some
little country whore!
 Do you think it may be witchcraft?
It could be for no other reason!
 This is what you get when you put
the Devil on the throne of England.
 And now he is to sign
this deal with Burgundy
 which will make me
look a fool to France
 which is precisely what she wanted!
 Well, she will not win this!
We will bide our time.
 She has no son yet.
 She will NOT win!
 What will happen to us, Issy?
 Well...
 Father will find us
someone else, I suppose.
 Couldn't you marry
the Prince of France?
 He's not yet married.
 What use is a Prince of France?
 We must get ourselves
in the line of succession here.
 Everything that has happened,
Annie, is her fault.
 She has ruined our matches and...
 we are insulted.
 The King has chosen Burgundy
 and Warwick's secret deal
with France is over.
 The King's sister, Margaret,
will marry our very own cousin,
Charles of Burgundy.
 So Warwick is escorting Margaret
to her wedding in Burgundy?
 Ah, he's a nursemaid!
 So now he won't
get his land in France.
 And you must have sons
to protect yourself from Warwick.
 Look at your hair.
 Mary?
Mother!
 Lizzie? Could you hold Mary?
 Your Grace!
 We shall never get there if we must
stop every three minutes, girls!
 Where's Father?
 I told you, he's travelling his
kingdom. We're riding to join him.
 Elizabeth.
Father! What are you doing here?
 We are to ride with you.
 There is a rebellion,
a Robin of Redesdale.
 That's a fanciful name
for some petty rebel, Father.
 Ed will stamp it all
out in a heartbeat.
 Someone is paying the men,
Elizabeth.
 They have strong, new boots
and this is Warwick's country.
 Warwick? What threat is Warwick to us
now? This is no joke, Elizabeth.
 It is certain.
 There are thousands of men-in-arms
under Warwick's orders.
 He is king-making again.
 Oh, Issy. You look beautiful.
 Do you think George
will adore me, Annie?
 The way that the King does her?
 I am sorry that Father
could not get Richard for you.
 It is not him I was concerned with.
 Just, I did rather
want to be a duchess.
 Come. Let's get this done.
 Annie, please don't leave me.
 Mother! Mother!
My boys!
 I knew that Warwick was angry
 but never did I imagine he would
raise his own army against me!
 He has betrayed me!
 And so has George, for now I hear
he has married Isabel
 against my clear command!
 Warwick's plan must be to put George
upon the throne instead of me.
 God damn them both! But are you
sure that is what they are doing?
 I am sure of nothing!
 We have always stood shoulder
to shoulder on the battlefield.
 At the battle of Mortimer's Cross
there were three suns in the sky.
 Three suns!
 Everybody said it was
a sign from God for me,
 Richard and George,
the three Sons of York.
 So how can one brother betray
the others?
 With Warwick, the man you
thought of as your greatest friend.
 And who else betrays
us with them, huh?
 Our mother is not here, she's surely
gone to attend their wedding.
 George is her darling, after all.
 Why would she back George
instead of you?
 The old story.
Whether I am my father's son.
 Whether I am legitimate!
George is saying that I am a bastard
 and that would make him
the true York heir.
 Damn him! We will go and scotch
this snakes' nest before it comes
out of the ground.
 Are you alright?
 It was very brave of you to
stand up to the king and marry me.
 I want to make you happy.
 Isabel...
 God, you really don't know, do you?
 Annie! Annie!
 What is it?
 Was George bad to you?
 Has he hurt you?
 Yes, but no more than
Mother said I should expect.
 That's not it.
 It's very much worse, Annie.
 My wedding was never for me at all.
 It was a sign from Father that
men should rise against the King.
 Defying him as Father has done.
 George.
 Go to the city of Norwich.
Be a queen. Look unconcerned.
 I just cannot bear that this
is happening. You must take care.
 Please, all of you.
 Father, stay safe.
 Elizabeth, trust no-one.
 Show them you are queen.
We will be back soon.
 Your Grace.
 Still no word?
 Warwick's got past our look-out.
 His army's coming to besiege us.
 Ride to the protection of London.
 Go alone, you'll ride faster!
We'll stay and hold him off!
 TO ARMS!
 Quickly! Quickly, men!
 Brother.
 Lord Warwick's back!
 He's done it. Father has the King!
 "Dearest wife,
prepare yourself for bad news.
 "I am prisoner, held by Warwick.
 "I am unhurt but
you are in very grave danger
 "as Warwick will
come after you if he can.
 "Your father
and brothers have escaped
 "and will be on their way to you.
 "You must hasten to London.
 "You must raise the city
and arm the Tower for a siege.
 "For if George has a son,
we are lost.
 "I love you with all of my heart.
 "The one and only,
King of England.
 "Edward."
 Anthony! Thank God!
We must go to London! Sister.
 Warwick has captured Edward
and he's coming after me. Elizabeth.
 Are Father and John with you? Edward
said we must go to London. Sister!
 Our father... and John...
 they're dead.
 No. They were beheaded.
 There was no charge, no trial,
only the word of Warwick.
 No! Edward said...
You, you all escaped!
 There was an ambush.
They were waiting on the road ahead.
 No, Anthony! No, God!
No! Say it's not true, Anthony!
 NO!
 Jasper! Morning, Margaret.
 You have heard?
They've snatched him!
 Like the crown from the top
of the maypole.
 I do not know what they intend,
but I shall write to George
 and tell him he can name his price
if it will return my son his title.
 My husband must not know.
 My Lord. Stafford.
 Take me to Henry, Jasper. I have
something marvellous to tell him.
 Come.
 My Lord. Henry.
 Yes.
 Today is a special day
 because I have something
important to tell you.
 I have known this for a long time
 but I have waited until I was sure
to tell you both.
 You will be king.
Have you lost your senses, Margaret?
 God has told me in a vision, Henry.
 He said that you are His Chosen One.
 And you will be
King Henry Tudor of England.
 Ignore what your mother
just said, Henry,
 for it is treason and she
would surely lose her head for it.
 You had a vision?
And I have prayed upon it.
 But now, the old York poison
splits their House in two
 I know God has spoken to me truly.
 I will not hear this!
 It's coming to pass.
 Elizabeth makes only little
witches for the burning
 and perhaps the other
Yorks will be as cursed.
 And when they are,
we will be waiting with my boy
 for his chance upon the throne.
 God has said you will be king
 and you must hold that
in your heart.
 And when you are crowned king,
 my mother will kneel to me
 and she will call me
"Margaret Regina".
 What kind of a monster is he?
 No charge, no trial,
no chance for a defence?
 It was an execution.
And I shall have his head for it!
 Warwick cannot go unpunished!
 I cannot bear it, Mother.
Your father knew the risks.
 God knows, it wasn't
his first battle.
 He sent me this
before they killed him.
 He tells me to be happy,
 sends you his love.
 John is such a loss to me.
 He had his whole life ahead of him.
 When you raise a boy
and he becomes a man,
 you start to believe
that he is safe
 and that you are safe
from heartbreak.
 I should have known.
 I have the Sight,
I should have seen it.
 Edward's mother will know this pain.
 She will know the loss
of her son George. I swear it.
 You have lost a son and so shall she!
What should that achieve?
 It will not bring them back.
And there will be war again.
 They still have Edward!
 I must avenge my father and my
brother or God knows I shall go mad!
 I've tried to do it differently.
 I tried to do what Edward asked
and make them all my friends.
 But now I want them dead.
 Tear off a corner.
 Write their names on it in blood.
 Heat the charm,
keep it in the darkness.
 Do it by the riverside
on the waning moon.
 Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick.
I curse you.
 George Plantagenet, Duke
of Clarence, I curse you too.
 By my will, you both shall die.
