 The White Queen (2013): Season 1, Episode 10 - The Final Battle - full transcript 
 Queen Anne's health is deteriorating and the death of her sickly son Edward and the knowledge that her husband loves Lizzie do not help her situation. She ends her feud with Elizabeth ,assuring her that she was not responsible for the deaths of the two boys and soon afterwards, following an eclipse, she dies. Elizabeth and her daughters are released from sanctuary and return to the court where Lizzie reciprocates Richard's feelings for her. However she is betrothed to marry the dour Henry Tudor, not a match she relishes. Henry effects his rebellion - with Stanley now amongst his supporters - and at the Battle of Bosworth Field kills Richard, releasing his mother from her house arrest. Margaret thanks God that her son is declared king, a fact she had always known would happen, whilst Elizabeth, formerly a queen is now a queen mother, her daughter the White Princess.

 We must have our boy invested
Prince of Wales.
 Then there can be no question who is
next in line for the throne.
 Prince Richard must flee secretly
to Flanders.
 We must find a boy that's
the very image of you.
 Just by living,
they are a threat to us.
 Would you wish them killed?
 I do wish it.
 This is your plan to put your son on
the throne.
 If the princes are dead,
then he is two steps closer.
 Obviously the men must kill them.
 Edward? They're gone.
They've just vanished!
 I do not know what I have done.
What if I killed two little boys?!
 Whoever took our first-born son,
 you will take his first-born son
from him.
 The older girls will come to court.
 I want to keep Princess Elizabeth
close to me.
 What are you doing?
They are witches!
 Henry must strengthen his claim,
marry well.
 Princess Elizabeth. Lady Margaret
says that such a marriage would unite
 the Houses of York and Lancaster
and end these wars.
 Dear Henry and Jasper.
 We must make ready.
I think this is our moment.
 He has his army and he will not
waste it.
 Well, I take it I no longer need to
marry Tudor?
 I've written to Lady Margaret
that your betrothal still stands.
 I will not marry him, Mother!
 Fortune will send me someone else.
 Are you sending words of joy,
Margaret?
 No.
 I'm writing to Henry that he must
sail again soon as he's able
 and take his rightful throne.
 Do you not think that God has ruled
against your plan
 to make your Henry king by pinning him
in Brittany and locking you up here?
 It was you who caused us to fail.
 You and that witch.
 She's lucky I have not revoked her
bastard daughter's betrothal to Henry.
 Hm. My only consolation is that
Elizabeth
 is also a prisoner in the darkness
of the Abbey. No, she's not.
 Richard's reached an accord with her
and she's been freed.
 Her older girls are going to court.
 You and your son have been
disregarded.
 God... has chosen York and Rivers
after all.
 Margaret. Margaret! Teddy!
 Edward, where are your clothes?!
I'm hot.
 You're burning up.
You must be put to bed at once.
 No! Lady Mother, please!
We're playing. Anne?
 Edward has another fever.
He's just been running around.
 My spies tell me that Henry Tudor's
declared that he is King of England
 and announced his betrothal to
Princess Elizabeth.
 She is no princess! Hm.
 He claims that in her,
he will unite York and Lancaster
 and end these wars.
 If I am to suffer her here at court
 then we shall call her
by her proper name -
 the bastard girl Elizabeth!
 The disappearance of the princes
has only made him bolder
 and now he will invade
the very first moment he can.
 Your Grace.
 Edward. Edward!
 Come. Come, come, come.
 He is still very hot.
 How long has Prince Edward been like this?
This is the second fever. Father.
 Father!
 Hush, hush.
 The Princess is arriving!
 Mistress Elizabeth.
 Cecily.
 You will find me an easy queen to
serve.
 Unlike others before me.
 What is he doing?
 Do you intend to tell me what's made
you so exhilarated?
 You would never guess.
It's too... juicy.
 I thank God I'm not attached to worldly goods
or I might resent you drinking all my wine.
 Your heartfelt generosity makes me
drink it quicker!
 Is this about Henry's campaign?
 Campaign?!
 It looks as though your boy has lost
the Rivers' affinity so he may
 as well just settle down in Brittany
with a nice fat peasant girl.
 What do you mean, has lost it?!
 Because they will back him only by
his marriage to Princess Elizabeth.
 And... now she has a suitor.
 A suitor!
 Some grubby page?
No nobleman would marry her.
 Who's the fool?
 King Richard.
 He's her uncle!
 And he's married! To a woman who
is barren, whose son is weak,
 but God knows this new catch
should be fertile,
 judging by her mother's performance
in the marriage bed of England.
 He doesn't mean to marry her!
 He means to shame her as a whore
to humiliate my son!
 I don't think he does. It looks to
me like he's truly in love.
 Well, then you are as foolish
as she's wicked.
 Does she return these feelings?
 She loves him, body and soul.
 Oh! Well, then she is a whore!
Though why should that surprise me?
 I've lost my appetite.
 Go! Go!
 Get out!
 I want the Rivers girls to leave.
 I will not have them here.
 They are your nieces, Anne.
Why are you against them?
 Because my boy is ill, that's why!
 You said yourself she and her mother laid
a curse on whoever killed the princes.
 We are not guilty for whatever fate
befell the boys!
 But what if it was us?
 By accident, just by putting them
in the Tower at all!
 What if someone thought we wanted
it? We did not want it!
 Anne.
 I know you think I desire my niece.
 But the truth is... she is betrothed
to Henry Tudor.
 So who is the fool if I am bedding her?
If people think that I am bedding her?
 The world will see that she is not
with Tudor but with me,
 and all the men who would fight for
her because they loved her father
 will come to my side...
 and not to Tudor's.
 So just to win your point with him,
you would dishonour me?
 To win a war against him...
 I will play whatever cards I must.
 'And how are our numbers
in the north?'
 We are many.
 Enough are loyal to make us strong?
 With ease, my lord.
 Princess Elizabeth?
 May I walk you in to dine?
 Your Grace? Might I have the honour?
 My Lady! My Lady Anne!
 Margaret? What is it?
He said he was hot.
 But we were playing
and then I fell asleep.
 Oh, no! No! Richard!
 Oh, my baby! Edward! Edward.
 Edward? Is there pain? Tell me.
 Help him, Richard! Help him!
I don't know how to help him!
 Richard, save him! Please! Help him!
 My son.
 I command you to breathe!
 I am the King
and you will breathe for me!
 Edward!
 My boy!
 Oh, God! My boy!
 My Edward!
 Anne?
 Uncle Richard?
 Lady Anne, please.
Please, let me help you.
 My father in battle.
 Izzy to her poisoner.
 My baby to her curse.
 Anne, please.
 A witch's curse is all it could be.
 When the weak years of his boyhood
were behind him.
 Anne, I need you. Please.
 My son is gone.
 Then we must have another.
 After ten full years of trying?
 There is no point in touching me.
There is no point.
 Not even for love?
 You do not love me.
 Even at our own son's funeral
you went to her.
 She came to me because you would not.
 You killed those boys...
and lied to me.
 This is proof of it.
 I didn't.
 I didn't.
 'To my daughter Elizabeth.
 'I hear news of Prince Edward's
death and I'm troubled by it.
 'Do you think it is
the working of our curse?
 'I know you do not want to
marry Henry Tudor,
 'but he will come now Richard
no longer has an heir.
 'And if Richard is the murderer
of our boys,
 'then we cannot side with him.'
 I'm in love with you.
 Lady Mother!
 The Court is treating you well?
 That necklace is almost as grand
as mine was when I was queen.
 The court is treating her very well.
 Be quiet... Cecily.
 How is your uncle, the King?
Is he grieving still?
 Oh, he's found some comfort.
 Hasn't he, Lizzie?
Now, that's enough.
 Thomas, take the little ones.
Cecily, you too.
 Mother... I would like to speak to
Elizabeth on my own.
 Well?
 Is it Richard?
 What has happened between you?
 Mother, he...
 He isn't the tyrant that people
think he is. He's wonderful!
 And Queen Anne isn't well and
Richard needs an heir for England.
 He asked me if I thought that
our boys might have got away.
 Because then... You are not allowed to
tell him about your brother Richard!
 You promise me that.
Of course not.
 But he didn't kill them.
 Mother, he had
nothing to do with it.
 I'm certain of that.
 So how far has this...
gone between you?
 I take it there is gossip?
 He says that he loves me.
 Hm. He says that he will
put Anne aside and marry me.
 And if he does... I will be
Queen of England.
 Hm.
 'Dear Henry and Jasper,
 'it is hard for me to write to you
as I'm spied on,
 'but everything has changed here.
 'Richard's son is dead
and he no longer has an heir.
 'You must make ready with your army
and prepare to sail from France.
 'You must kill Richard now
before he has another son.
 'Then the York line will be
ended... for ever.'
 When Charles said we could swell
an army from his prisons,
 I hoped it would be
a better crop than this!
 We'll make it work, Henry.
 Right?
 Thomas, there is something
I would have you do for me.
 Of course, Mother. Anything.
 Go to the town of Tournai in Flanders
and find the St. Gene Bridge.
 The man who keeps the watergate
is called Johan Warbeck.
 Ask him for my precious jewel.
 My Perkin. Bring him home.
 The French have sided with Tudor.
They have given him an army.
 It is not over. I must make ready.
 That silk is beautiful.
 It would suit our niece, Elizabeth.
 You mean to compare us now
in matching gowns?
 Anne, you know the reason I must do
this. Do I, Richard? Truly?
 My love... you are not well.
 You must go to bed.
 They say you will put me aside and
marry her. Who told you that?
 Tudor will invade this spring.
 I must cut the York and Rivers'
affinity away from him.
 Take care you do not cut the Neville
affinity away from yourself.
 I am the Kingmaker's daughter
 and many in the north
only follow you for love of me.
 They'll turn against you
if they think you shame me.
 I know that.
 'To my wife.
 'The York Princess
commands the court,
 'but many share your view that
Richard has seduced his niece
 'only to show your son Henry
as a helpless cuckold.
 'He's a laughing stock
and no-one now believes
 'he can unite
the Houses of York and Lancaster.
 'Tell me, has he any other weapons
in his arsenal,
 'or should we get you
kitted out in white
 'with your saint's knees in the dirt
before the King to beg forgiveness?'
 I've won.
 The York affinity are all with me,
 so Tudor must call on Lancaster
alone to swell up his convict army.
 The girl has done her work.
 But you have ruined her
and she is known as broken meats.
 There is a price to pay
if you venture near the throne.
 She knows that. I have fought
too hard to be King.
 I will not give it up for Tudor.
 I wish I could go back and never
have been Queen.
 Anne?
 No!
 Please!
 Anne! Anne, what is it?
 Lady Anne. Your Grace.
 Sir Robert.
 I asked you once
about Elizabeth's sons,
 the princes, and told you we
wouldn't be safe...
 until they were dead.
 I'm dying, Sir Robert.
 And I need to know
what I must confess.
 Did you act upon what I said?
 Did you kill the boys?
 No.
 They are not dead?
 I would not know, Your Grace.
 I can tell you only that they
were not killed on my watch.
 My conscience is clear, then.
 And so is mine.
 Mother.
 Girls, go inside.
 Something... very strange
is happening.
 Oh, Holy Lord!
 I am your servant!
 I have a vision!
 Well, then, God is calling me as
well, because I can see it too.
 Oh, it's a sign!
 It's a sign the York reign
is ending.
 The sun in splendour
is being put out
 and the new king will come
like a dragon.
 My son must sail!
 His time is come!
 Anne, did you see the sun?
 How strange it was!
 My sister is here?
 And my son, Edward?
 Anne?
 My Lady Anne?
 Oh!
 Oh, God!
 Richard?
 She wasn't supposed to die.
 Not now. Not yet.
 Maybe it was a broken heart
because of me.
 Richard, you mustn't.
 I cannot talk to you, Elizabeth.
 They are saying I killed her
so I could marry you.
 But it isn't true!
 They are saying I poisoned her.
 The northern lords are all
for joining Tudor.
 As his ships... are loading in
Harfleur,
 bringing an army against me.
 You have to go, Elizabeth.
 No, Richard. Please!
I am not Richard!
 I am your King!
 Now go.
 Go!
 'So Richard sends
the witch's girl to us.'
 He's hoping to prove his indifference to her.
He thinks that if her mother-in-law-to-be
 will give her house room, it will
show the world that she is chaste,
 and not, as we all thought,
bedding him as his wife was dying.
 He uses her then spits her out.
 Well, I wouldn't be so sure of that.
 He's on the march and... if Richard
defeats your son,
 he may still make her queen.
 This battle will decide
all our futures.
 So don't bully her, Margaret.
 I do not bully.
 I will merely help her
to move closer to our Lord.
 The wind has changed.
 He's sailing.
 But Lizzie is at his mother's house.
 And if Henry Tudor wins
and Lizzie marries him,
 her sons will die, won't they?
 Because you cursed the line
of whoever killed my brother.
 I won't intrude on you for very
long, Lady Margaret, but the King...
 We do not speak in God's house.
 And you will pray five times a day
 that my son forgives you
for your sin.
 And that God will make you
worthy of his hand.
 Oh, Lord.
 Favour me on this cause.
 I thought in Wales they'd flock to
join the Tudor standard.
 Where are the men?
 Ah, you're mustering your troops,
Margaret. I have to do the same.
 Richard's ordered every man
to turn out for his cause
 with penalties for those who fail.
 Have you picked a side?
 You may believe
I sold you to King Richard,
 but this morning my stepson
is one heartbeat from the throne.
 And it is my army that will decide
the outcome of this battle.
 Are you or are you not for Henry?
 Brackenbury?
 The Tudor army has landed
and what a motley band of convicts.
 How many?
Less than half your numbers.
 And Wales is not declaring for him.
 But we do not have Lord Stanley yet.
 Send a man to take Princess
Elizabeth from Lady Stanley's care.
 Command her husband to me
with his army now.
 Him and his brother.
 I saw the Royal Guards outside.
 Is it word from Richard?
 He's using you, you fool, to shame
Henry and rob men from his side.
 But you're so vain
you think he loves you.
 He does love me, you spiteful...
 You're a whore.
 You are monstrous in the eyes of God
for what you've done with him.
 You are the monster
for murdering my poor brother!
 You know nothing!
 My son will never marry you.
 Yes, he will.
 If he wins.
 Because that's the only way
he'd have
 the support of England
for his backside on the throne!
 So whatever happens in this battle,
I will be Queen,
 and this is the very last time that
you will ever sit in my presence.
 My Lady.
 What is... what is wrong, my Lady?
 She says he doesn't love me.
 She says that Richard is using me
so that he can win the war.
 Is it true?
 Sir John, is it true?
 Will you take me to him?
 Please.
 Please. Please. Please. My orders from the
King are to take you up to Sheriff Hutton.
 I'll send a letter on ahead,
but I must see him.
 Once at least before the battle.
 Please.
 Come.
Thank you. Thank you.
 Lord Stanley writes that he is ill,
so he cannot meet for battle.
 Upon my honour, Your Grace.
 It is your father's honour
which is the issue here.
 Has he gone to Henry Tudor?
 I...
 No! My father is
true to you, Your Grace.
 Write to your father.
 Tell him if he does not meet us
on the road with his
 and his brother's full armies
tomorrow,
 you will die.
 If Stanley sides with Richard,
we'll be slaughtered.
 Even if he sits it out,
we'll be outnumbered.
 You must have faith, Henry.
 He will come.
 'Dear Mother, I have bad news.
 'Wales has not turned out for us
and now we hear Richard has
 'Lord Stanley's son held hostage to
make sure he joins him.
 'Mother, I can't lie to you,
we will lose without Lord Stanley
 'and I beg you to persuade him
to declare for us.
 'Please, God,
I'll see you at my coronation,
 'or else I shall never
see you again.'
 Where is he? My Lady.
 Henry's due...
 Husband...
 My Lady.
 I have heard about your son, but
Jasper and my boy have need of you.
 Well, then you will know that I
cannot join Henry until the battle,
 or my son will die.
 But one of you could join
them, surely?
 Isn't that what you do?
One brother on each side?
 Lady Margaret.
 If you don't declare for Henry
before the battle, he'll lose.
 He has not the men he hoped for.
 And those he has,
they'll just desert him
 once they know that he's
outnumbered. He'll be killed.
 You're asking me to
choose between your son and my own.
 Henry would ensure that
you are rewarded when he is King.
 And your son...
 Your son would be honoured
as a man of courage,
 the first to fall in
Henry's service.
 Please, Stanley, it...
 It is the will of God
that my son should be King.
 Well then God may crown him
without my help.
 I cannot put your son before mine.
 I thought I'd never see you again.
 I've come to make Stanley
declare for us.
 Have you spoken to him?
 He will not join you, Jasper.
 He and his brother will both
wait for the battle.
 I'm sorry.
 I have led you both to this
and now I cannot save you.
 Margaret, hush... It's all my fault!
 I thought I had a calling.
 I... I thought Henry had
a destiny to be King,
 and now you will both die
in a field because of me.
 Margaret, please, you must not say
that. You have to go. You have to go.
 You have to run away, please.
Just go!
 Just take my son and run. Just flee.
 I've been running all my life,
Margaret.
 And so has Henry.
 This time we will stand our ground
and fight.
 No matter what fate should deal us.
 Let me see him.
 Please.
 All right.
 Henry?
 Mother?
 Am... Am I dreaming?
Are you really here?
 I'm here.
 I'm here, my love. I'm here.
 And is God here?
 If He is with me...
 I know that I will win.
 God is with you. You cannot fail.
 The will of God
has always been for you.
 Please don't be angry with me.
 I had to see you.
 Lady Margaret said
that you are using me.
 And laughed at me for loving you.
 If it is true
then you must tell me and I'll go.
 It's not true.
 I did not mean to love you.
 But I do.
 I hate myself for it.
 But I fell in love with you.
 I cannot bare to lose you.
 You will not lose me
on the battlefield.
 At least of all this one.
 Tudor is a novice.
 His affinity have stayed at home.
 His mongrel army will be routed.
 So you will win then.
 I will win.
 And then I will make you Queen Elizabeth.
 You and me for England.
 I want all this out of here, right.
As fast as you can, the sun's coming up.
 Come on, lad. We need
all this out of the way.
 I want you to take it out there and by there,
all right? Fast as you can, the sun's coming up.
 Henry?
 Like a Tudor, eh?
 Like a Tudor, uncle.
 Come on. The sun's coming up.
Come on.
 They're even more of
a shambles in the dawn light.
 No word from Stanley?
 He says he's on his way but...
 You will not even need him.
 Your Grace.
 You're riding into battle
in your crown?
 If Tudor wants to take me on,
then he won't have to search for me.
 Give the word.
 To arms!
 Charge!
 You do know my father
will decide this battle?
 Go, Henry! Get to safety!
 Damn Stanley!
Why does he not declare for me?
 Charge!
 York! York, to me!
 York and England!
 England!
 England!
 Whose side?
 Whose side?!
 For Tudor! For Tudor!
 For Tudor!
 Treason!
 For Tudor!
 Get the King a horse!
 God save the King.
 God save the King.
 God save the King!
God save the King!
 God save the King!
 I promised you this day would come.
 You may stay down on your knees.
 I am the King's mother and you
shall kneel to me as to a queen.
 I am Margaret Regina.
 Richard? Oh, my boy.
 My boy.
 Is it true that my brother
Prince Edward is dead?
 I'm afraid it is.
 When I'm grown
I will avenge him.
 Vengeance brings only more vengeance.
 Battle brings death.
 I would have you live
with me in peace, my love.
 Come.
 Elizabeth?
 Mother, I'm afraid.
 You must be strong.
You will marry Henry Tudor.
 And you will be Queen of England.
 As I once was.
