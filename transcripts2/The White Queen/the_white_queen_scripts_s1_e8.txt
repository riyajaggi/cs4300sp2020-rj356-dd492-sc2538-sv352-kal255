 The White Queen (2013): Season 1, Episode 8 - The King Is Dead - full transcript 
 1483:- Elizabeth is concerned when Edward allows Henry Tudor home from exile but he reasons that he prefers to keep his enemies close to him. Soon afterwards Edward suddenly dies of pneumonia, appointing Richard as the regent for his young son Edward. Anne, however, encourages her husband to crown himself king as the country's enemies may take advantage of a boy king. Richard takes the boy and places him in the Tower of London, causing Elizabeth, now powerless, to again go into sanctuary with her children. Richard has Anthony Rivers and Elizabeth's son Richard Grey killed and demands her younger son, though she sends him to Flanders and gives over a changeling boy. Margaret believes that an alliance with Elizabeth, leading to Henry marrying Elizabeth's daughter, would secure her son's claim to the throne but her husband Thomas Stanley reminds her that they must appear loyal to both sides and so they see Richard crown himself king.

 These are my boys, Richard and
Thomas Grey. Will you marry me?
 Yes!
You are not married, Elizabeth!
 It was a pretend service. He's done
it before and he has a bastard son.
 I am not happy about this marriage.
 Your daughter could never be royal.
 Jane Shore, her name's all around
the Court.
 Your husband is a king with
a king's appetites.
 Have you known loss, Lady Margaret?
 My only son is forced to live away
from me.
 He is heir to the House of Lancaster,
an enemy to the King.
 Jasper, you're the only man
I trust to look after him.
 Are we to live in Wales?
 We won't but our son will.
 Then I will appoint his guardian.
I am his mother. And if he is to leave me,
 I will choose into whose care he will
go and who will raise him into a man.
 I want you to take my son, Anthony.
You are the only one I can trust with him.
 We are the three sons of York.
 How can we be divided by one woman?
 Your Henry is going to have to walk
past five coffins to take the crown
 and I don't know how he's going to
manage that. Do you?
 You're too long in Brittany,
Henry Tudor.
 You do that to a Welsh knight
and see if you're still smiling.
 I can only beat what you
put in front of me, Uncle.
 Well, your timing is perfect.
 Absolutely perfect.
 Hmm. Lovely. The perfect match
for gracious King Edward.
 Gracious? Truly. Allowing my son
to return from exile.
 Well, perhaps it shows how secure
the King is on the throne.
 It seems your boy is not
a threat to us any more.
 He's a man now.
 Of course. He's been away so long,
you must hardly know him.
 Ah, my prize catch!
 From your boasts, Father, I half
expected an army to bring it in.
 Princess Elizabeth will be having
a small portion for that remark.
 And I'll be having yours as you've
clearly had too many of late.
 I am merely eating like a king.
Shall we dine alone tonight,
 send these little leeches
away to eat with the peasantry?
 Leeches!
He called me a leech, Thomas!
 Have as much as you like, Father.
You've earned the right to enjoy yourself.
 More wine, Father?
 Thank you, Richard, Cecily,
all my delightful children.
 And my queen.
 Are you unwell?
 You're warm.
 It's nothing.
 My son is coming home.
 I think Jasper Tudor would be
glad to come home, too.
 Well, he can come home...
 to the block.
 Don't get your hopes up, Margaret.
 Your son is not returning home
as a contender to the throne.
 He's just... another pretender
that Edward's brought to heel.
 I still believe God will have my son
on the throne of England.
 But what are you doing about it?
What's your plan?
 Pray for a miracle?
 Here. Here, sip this. Shhh!
Darling, what pains you?
 Wife... to bed.
 I think Your Grace
should save his strength.
 Oh! Edward!
 Help! Somebody! Oh, the King!
 The King!
 It's a fever. It'll pass.
 Fevers pass.
 My brother, Richard, send for him.
 Shhh. It's not necessary.
 You're strong.
 You don't lose.
 You are a born warrior.
 Fight this for me.
 Do as I ask, Elizabeth.
 Lady Mother, what is the cause of
this? Nobody knows.
 Is it something he ate? We all had the same
at dinner, there's no sign of food poison.
 All we can do is wait
for the fever to break.
 Send word to Richard,
the Privy Councillors.
 And find Uncle Anthony, Thomas.
 Prepare horses, my clothes.
Yes, my lord.
 Weapons. We ride to London.
 Richard, what's the matter?
Are we at war?
 The King is gravely ill.
 But his heir is just a boy,
not ready to reign.
 Elizabeth.
 She will try to rule through him
as she does through Edward.
 This is your divine act!
 I'm sure the Queen will fish out
some potion to restore his...
 I must send word to Brittany.
Henry must stay put for now.
 If the King should die...
 We should wait until we know
who is Lord Protector.
 We must be cautious...
 but ready to grasp any opportunity
if it comes up.
 Let's just see how it plays out.
 We thank you, Your Grace,
for sending for us.
 How is my brother?
 You're here just in time.
 You saw the look she cut us.
 Her fortunes fade with the King.
 She's like a wounded beast
defending her lair.
 And you're a threat.
 Be wary.
 Brackenbury.
 Buckingham.
 It is the fate of kings
 that we never get to see what
kind of ruler our sons will be.
 I will never get to know what kind
of man my sweet boy will become.
 I beg you... be as one now.
 Care for Prince Edward.
 Keep him safe.
 I will work with all of you... to
put Prince Edward on the throne.
 And I, Your Grace.
 And I.
 Anthony.
 Richard shall be guardian.
 As you wish.
 Surely you mean Anthony?
 Richard is Lord Protector
until Prince Edward comes of age.
 Do you accept this, Elizabeth?
 Now leave us.
 I want to say goodbye to my husband.
 Look upon your king one last time
and remember him in your prayers.
 I will honour your wish.
 I know this does not please you.
 Anthony is his true guardian. He has
taught him everything he knows.
 Anthony's name goes against him.
 The Rivers are esteemed
by the people, but not the Court.
 I trust Richard to do what I ask.
 I did it for peace.
 I know. I just...
 Please don't make me waste my last
words on matters of state.
 You are the love of my life.
 You are mine.
 Thank you, lovely Elizabeth...
 for waiting under that oak tree.
 For wanting me.
 You gave me... another chance.
 A better life.
 Beautiful children!
 Certainty.
 No!
 No!
 No! No! No!
 No!
 Mother? Mother!
 You won't even bow to me!
 We're equal now.
 Both mothers to a king.
 This tension is unbearable.
 We must sustain it.
 Sister, I am so sorry.
Get word to my son, Richard Grey,
 and tell him to bring Prince Edward
here from Wales.
 People are already taking sides
and I fear the outcome.
 Elizabeth? It will be Richard
and the Yorks around my boy's throne
 and I'll be sent back to Grafton!
You won't. Richard is a decent man.
 He loved the King.
 Swore to do right by your son.
I don't trust any of them!
 I...need my son, the King,
to protect me.
 Send word, Anthony.
 I want my son here now,
so he can be crowned.
 Get that boy.
 Mother, please, not now. She's right.
 Keep him away from her.
 She accepted Edward's decision.
 So Edward would die happy.
She was lying through gritted teeth.
 She had George executed,
poisoned Isabel,
 who knows what she'd do to secure
the throne for the Rivers.
 Your sister died from childbirth!
 I know you don't trust her,
 I know to be careful
and I know what has to be done.
 So leave being Lord Protector
to me.
 Sir Robert.
 Mistress Shore.
Your Grace, I am truly sorry.
 Please. The Queen
has just lost her husband.
 Show some respect.
 You have no place here now.
But, Your Graces...
 Brackenbury, throw this woman out.
 Her kind is not welcome at Court.
 Your Grace. Please, I'm no longer...
This is my home. I have nowhere to go.
 Make sure she leaves, Sir Robert.
 Then ready my horse
and good men.
 This isn't goodbye.
 He's not going anywhere just yet.
 What?
 Word from your mother.
 A change of plan.
 Come on, out.
 Out.
 The King is dead.
 Huh! How?
 Fever... apparently.
 So what now?
We wait and see what happens.
 We must be ready to raise an army.
 For when you do return... you will
be fighting for the throne.
 Stay back.
 Whoa!
 My Lord Grey.
 What is this, Brackenbury?
 We're to escort the King to
the Tower for his protection.
 We are grateful for your concern, but I too
have orders to take the Prince to Westminster.
 I'm going to see my mother.
Prepare my horse.
 Argh! Stop!
 Forgive me. Richard, I demand
the right to ride on.
 Lower your sword, sir.
I won't until you let us pass.
 Secure the Prince's safety.
 Stop it!
 I promised your father
I would keep you safe.
 Don't touch him!
 No!
 Edward!
 Bring them home!
 Jane?
 What is it?
 I'm banished from Court.
My family turned me away.
 Friends won't give me shelter.
 Help me! Come in.
 I didn't think my fall from grace
would be so swift.
 Thank you.
 The death of a king
always causes disharmony.
 People overreact, take sides.
 This will all blow over
once young Edward is crowned.
 You haven't heard? Richard has taken
Prince Edward to the tower.
 I regret what happened to your guard,
but my men were there to protect you.
 You outnumbered us.
 You are safe here. Until you are
the King, you are vulnerable.
 What sort of Protector would Uncle Richard be
if he put you even in the slightest danger?
 I wish to console my mother.
 She is suffering, Edward.
 Better to go
when she's herself again.
 I'll visit in the morning.
 We have much to discuss.
 And I am sorry.
 How dare he terrorize my sons?
 He claims he's keeping Prince Edward
safe, just keeping his promise.
 You believe that? Yes.
 I knew I should have
gone to fetch him myself.
 Then you'd be in the Tower too. I've petitioned
the Privy Council to demand their release.
 Anthony! This is an act of war.
 We must raise men now.
And risk your brother's safety?
 You're upset, rightly, but have faith
that Richard will do what is right...
 He put Edward in the Tower
to keep him from me.
 And he arrested Richard Grey.
 Take everything of value, wake your brother
and your sisters, we're going into sanctuary.
 Sister! Lizzie.
Mother, talk to Uncle Richard.
 Or get Anthony to.
 Ask him to let my brothers go
as a show of consideration.
 Only fools wait to see if their
enemies might be friends!
 Richard's got Edward, what's stopping
him from snatching my other son?
 Do as I say!
 I'll send word to my brother
to ready the fleet.
 You mustn't do this!
 Join us after. I'd serve you all better
on the outside as your eyes and ears.
 Send word when it's done.
 Take care,
my dear son Thomas Grey.
 Please! You must trust him.
 I trust nobody!
 Play your politics
to secure my sons' release.
 If anything happens to them,
I will never forgive you!
 Not just jewels, she's taken the
entire Treasury to Westminster
 to provide for her children
in sanctuary.
 How long does she plan to stay?
 This truly is a gift.
 The boys' abduction gives Elizabeth
reason to doubt Richard
 and her taking off with the war
chest gives him cause to fear her.
 If this escalates...
They fight for the crown.
 Well, one or the other could fall,
they could destroy each other.
 The throne would be empty,
my son's to claim.
 Is this our chance?
 They're all in the abbey,
apart from Thomas Grey.
 We've intercepted a letter from him
to his uncle, Edward Rivers.
 The Lord Admiral?
They wish to ready the fleet.
 Arrest the Lord Admiral
and Thomas Grey for treason.
 We can't have them
plotting against me.
 Rally the men, all of them.
 Why? Why would Elizabeth do this?
Because she's devious.
 When will you accept she doesn't
want you anywhere near her son?
 She could buy an army
with those riches.
 Perhaps. But what can
she achieve from sanctuary?
 You've a short memory.
 She called up a mist
to conceal your advance
 upon my father's forces at Barnet
the last time she was there.
 Guard yourself against her ways,
protect yourself and the King's legacy.
 That's all I want,
to crown his son, like he asked.
 Then do it.
 And name yourself Lord Protector,
before she can do anything about it.
 I'll send a message saying that
I will not be intimidated.
 Soldiers, everywhere.
The gates, cloisters.
 Then this is war.
 No. No, no, Mother.
 We can't fight Richard,
the York Army, from this dungeon!
 Do you think that is
what your father thought
 when he faced the Lancastrian Army
four times his number at Barnet?
 No. He won the greatest
victory in England's history!
 And he is in every one of you.
 His is the voice charging you
to be valiant and brave.
 We might be boxed in here,
but we have him watching over us.
 Forgive me.
 It has been a tiring few days.
 Well, then, may I offer my services,
 as Your Grace is likely
to be at Court a while?
 The last thing the country needs
is a lack of direction.
 Forgive me, ladies,
 I don't feel up to a fitting for
the Prince's coronation just now.
 Your Grace.
 He will be crowned
three days from now.
 I bring news
from your brother Anthony.
 Please let me in.
 Your Grace.
 Anthony is keeping his distance
to appear detached
 but he petitions for you.
 He's convinced Richard to set a date for
Edward's coronation, three days from now.
 How do I know this is not a trap,
set by Richard, to lure us out?
 Richard cast me out, threw me onto
the streets the moment the king died.
 So Anthony now provides for you?
 I admire him greatly.
 It's why I risk so much coming here.
 Cecily.
 Richard plans on crowning my son?
Yes.
 Anthony thinks you should go to the
coronation and show you can work with Richard.
 That will never happen.
 I have demands of my own - that he releases
my sons and that Richard's punished!
 Mother. Anthony has brokered
a truce, offered us a way out.
 Don't undermine his efforts.
 Tell him I'd feel better if he
removed the soldiers from the abbey.
 And tell Anthony I'll consider it.
 Tell him I am sorry.
 I said things in rage.
 Your Graces.
 The soldiers, they're gone.
 Richard's yielding. Anthony must
have conveyed your request.
 Wait.
 Can we trust Richard?
 Should we now attend
Edward's coronation?
 All of Richard's soldiers left?
 Anthony Rivers requested it
and assured an end to hostilities.
 They're still wary of each other.
 But they're just not
killing each other.
 We must end this truce.
 Elizabeth must not be allowed
to trust Richard. Agreed.
 Edward, a bastard?
Our cooks were gossiping about it.
 Naturally, I scolded and warned them
never to repeat...
 And who's telling you these
old rumours? Soldiers.
 No. Such conduct is shameful.
 It would be beneath
most soldiers I know.
 These were Richard's men.
 Why are you telling me this?
 Because I worry for you all.
 If this is true and Richard
were to recall Parliament,
 declare Edward illegitimate,
you'd lose everything.
 Your children would be disinherited.
 What if he's not after peace?
 There is one other thing.
 As you were away from Court, I felt
you needed eyes and ears there,
 so I offered my services to Anne.
 How very kind of you!
 This may be trivial, but how do you
understand Anne's refusal
 to be fitted
for your son's coronation?
 What? I may be reading too much into
it, she may have enough gowns.
 Or... Or she's not going, for there
may not even be a coronation.
 No. No.
 Jane Shore,
passing messages to Elizabeth?
 From your enemies, I'm told.
 Told by whom?
It's the talk of Court, my Lord.
 With respect, it's unlikely that people would concern
Your Graces with such a seedy matter. Yet you do.
 I raise it only to protect you,
your reputation.
 I'm sure you wouldn't want to
be seen to be out-manoeuvred
 by the Queen and her
growing band of conspirators?
 Nor played by you, Stanley.
 My Lord, I would never do any...
No, but your tone is leading.
 I am able to make my own judgments.
 It seems banishing Jane Shore
has given her cause to defy me.
 Why would Elizabeth plot
with her husband's mistress?
 Desperation?
Her friends must be few.
 You should have men
follow the whore,
 see who she's in bed with now.
 "In remembering th'unsteadfastness
 "This world being of such wheeling
 "Me...
 "Contrary?"
 Contrary... What may I guess?
 It's a first stanza.
I need to finish it.
 What in God's name?
 Arrest the traitor.
 Get off me.
Leave him alone. Stop it.
 Don't touch me. Get out!
 Get out! Cover yourself.
 Take him away.
 Anthony?
 He's always been so loyal to me,
even these past few days.
 He's a Rivers. Her brother.
 You must punish him
and his whore.
 I vowed...
 We all swore to be as one,
care for the child, see him crowned.
 Then you must do what your heart
tells you with more authority.
 If the soldiers in the abbey didn't
scare Elizabeth into submission
 then do something that will.
 Show them who's
the real Lord Protector.
 Deus meus, ex toto corde
me paenitet.
 Ac doleo de omnibus...
 They pity her.
 Christi super omnia diligaris.
 Per merita passionis Salvatoris
nostri lesu Christi,
 Domine, miserere.
 Richard, I plead with you
to listen to reason.
 I am not your enemy.
 It's Buckingham. May I come in?
 Hide, hide. Quick, hide.
 A private word with Your Grace.
 This is from Richard.
He handed it to me as I left.
 He thought his nieces and nephew
might want some fresh food.
 Why are you really here?
 He would very much like Prince
Richard to join his older brother
 in preparation
for his coronation. No.
 For moral support and so he can be
fitted with a handsome outfit.
 Would Your Grace like his tunic
embroidered in gold, rubies?
 Perhaps he would
just like to see his older brother?
 My son has a cold
and can't go anywhere.
 Ah, Richard won't be happy at all.
 But... I will not take
a sick child from his mother.
 Anthony has been arrested, along
with his mistress, Jane Shore. What?
 Suspected of conspiring with Thomas Grey
and you against the Lord Protector.
 My God. What about Thomas?
He got away.
 Your Grace, it would
help Anthony very much
 if you complied with
Richard's demands.
 I will return tomorrow.
 Let's hope there is
some change in his condition.
 Richard, stay down, stay covered.
 We must get you out of here,
tonight.
 You and Thomas Grey.
 We must find a boy that's
the very image of you.
 Mother. To defy Richard now
would be to put us all at risk.
 Don't you see?
 Richard can do whatever he wants,
whether we comply or not.
 He can keep dishonouring us.
 He can keep your brother
out of sight and rule through him.
 I have a chance of saving my son
and I must take it.
 "Lady Margaret, I need your help.
 "I am grateful for your loyalty,
but now we must act."
 You are doing a great
service for the King.
 Let's get you a bed, Geoffrey.
 Damn Richard...
 Duke of Gloucester.
 Damn his sword arm, Lord Protector.
 Husband to a frail wife.
 Father to a sickly heir.
 'He's Lord Protector.'
 He shouldn't have to justify himself
to Privy Councillors!
 They wouldn't have liked the way
he hauled Anthony Rivers out of bed
 or sent Buckingham
to secure the other boy.
 Gives the impression
he doesn't care for their counsel.
 You are the Lord Protector.
We must put a stop to this.
 I know, Brackenbury.
Damned fools, don't they see? Argh!
 My Lord! Richard?
 Fetch a physician, Brackenbury!
No, no. It'll pass...
 This is her. I can tell.
She's cursed you, your sword arm.
 I'm sure it is nothing,
Your Grace, it'll pass.
 The Council are demanding
Anthony's release, almost to a man.
 I cannot reason with these people.
 I do not even know
if I can trust them.
 If they support him,
they're against you.
 They could be plotting
in there as we speak.
 There are too many men having
their say in matters of security
 and Prince Edward's future.
 Root out the traitors.
 'We must free
Prince Edward from the Tower.
 'I fear Richard will only use my son
to further his ambitions.'
 Stand aside. Men, follow me.
Follow me.
 Secure the door.
Seek out any evidence of treason.
 What is the meaning of this?
 Lord Stanley's under house arrest,
we're to search his papers.
 Chambers.
This is absurd! To what end?
 With me.
 Richard suspects the Council
has been plotting with the Queen
 and Anthony Rivers.
 My husband is an ally of Richard's.
 This is, this is how
he treats his friends?
 These are my possessions. Let them
look. We've nothing to hide.
 Please. They're sacred items.
They're delicate.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
 That Bible is consecrated.
 The only other person
to have held it
 is His Holiness himself, the Pope.
 Thank you, Sir Robert.
 Lord Stanley.
 I could find no evidence that you
took part in this conspiracy.
 Of course you couldn't.
 My apologies, Lady Margaret.
 Men!
 Oh, my God!
 Were any charges brought?
 Thankfully, not against you.
 Would you mind helping me?
 It's a sensitive matter and Richard's
asked for complete discretion.
 I'd do anything to help the Duke,
not least to prove my loyalty.
 Still? You wouldn't?
 He's just shown he's willing
to act of his own accord.
 There's no questioning him.
We must all do as he says.
 I worry what he might do tomorrow,
 after he has crowned the boy
and is confirmed as Lord Protector.
 Stanley. Lord Buckingham.
 Tell your brother
I'll be thinking of him.
 As we all will, Your Grace.
 Come, child.
 Do you really think people
will believe he is Richard?
 At least it will buy some time
to get our boy away.
 If you didn't think it was safe for
Prince Richard to go to the Tower
 then you must believe
Edward's at risk too.
 When he sees Geoffrey, realises what's
happened, he'll fear for his life.
 He will know I had no choice,
 that I'll be trying to get
him out of there.
 The boy has instructions. Tell Uncle
Richard he can be Lord Protector.
 That you'll give up wanting
your "Rivers King".
 Never. We must protect the throne and I don't
trust your uncle to do what's right now.
 Mother, please, try to see reason.
Why did he want both sons?
 He knows that if you have the heirs,
you hold all the power.
 There. Your brother
has come to see you crowned.
 I would often share
with your father.
 He would tell me great stories,
of battles and great warriors.
 But would be ashamed of you if he
saw how you were treating his sons.
 Richard, how are you?
Well, Your Grace.
 I'm not yet King, brother,
call me Edward.
 You'll be crowned in the morning.
 How can you crown a boy
who'd grow up to be your enemy?
 What would you have me do, Anne?
Not make him King?
 Take the throne for myself?
 I have to get the coronation
over with.
 Swear the boy in so I'm
Lord Protector and no other.
 As King, he'll always be looking
to Anthony Rivers,
 the man who raised him.
And his mother.
 Crown him, and you will be
signing your own death warrant,
 putting us at risk, too.
 Name yourself King,
it is the safest option now.
 Finally,
 someone who is not afraid
of saying what we're all thinking.
 I worry how that might look,
my Lord.
 I can't be seen
to be stealing the throne,
 the people would not allow it.
The people only want peace.
 They know how risky it is
to have a young king.
 You wouldn't be stealing anything.
Enough, Mother. They know.
 Edward was wed before.
 His marriage to Elizabeth
was never legitimate.
 I never thought there was
any truth in those rumours.
 I know of at least one ceremony
performed in secret
 so he could bed a woman.
 He has bastards all over England.
 Then you must crown yourself,
 for those boys in the Tower
are not entitled!
 Neither am I. And I wouldn't
be King in the eyes of God.
 God knows you'd only be doing it to
stop a commoner from being crowned,
 a witch from reigning.
 You'd be totally justified
and sanctified.
 Convene Parliament.
 I'll warn Henry he's no longer preparing
to face a young king, but Richard.
 Is Buckingham with us?
As much as he ever will be.
 His claim is as strong as your son's.
 Well then, Henry must
strengthen his claim. Marry well.
 Princess Elizabeth.
 Her mother stands to lose everything
now. She'll be open to the match.
 And Henry could call upon her
support fighting for the throne.
 That's for later.
For now we have to convince her
 we're working with her to get
the princes out of the Tower.
 Your Grace.
 I'm Doctor Lewis,
Lady Margaret Stanley's physician.
 Forgive the plague mask, I needed
a disguise to bypass the guards.
 Grave news, Your Grace.
 Richard, Duke of Gloucester
plans to make himself King.
 Parliament declared your marriage
to Edward of York invalid
 and your sons as bastards.
What? No. He can't. Mother?
 Lady Margaret is cutting us too?
 On the contrary, she's on your side,
as is her husband.
 They believe Richard
has acted unlawfully
 and they fear for
the safety of your sons.
 You got my letter
explaining everything?
 That I played no part
in any betrayal?
 We could've raised
Prince Edward together.
 I'm no threat.
 I know that if I crown him,
he'd only take your counsel
 and I cannot trust you.
 You can. You have no proof
of any betrayal!
 You can't do this to me!
Richard, please.
 I've done nothing wrong!
Richard, please!
 I am Your Grace, King to be.
 Though you will never
see me crowned.
 Spare Richard Grey.
 Think about this,
what you're doing!
 Lizzie? What's wrong?
You'll never give up, will you?
 Your ambition
will be the death of the boys
 and when they're all gone,
you'll put me on the throne.
 You love the crown more than us.
 I don't.
You can't know such a thing.
 Yes, I can. You know that I...
 You've had a seeing.
 What did you see?
 Is it Anthony?
 Richard Grey?
I'm sorry, Mother. I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 'My life was lent me to one intent.
 'It is nigh spent.
 'Welcome, fortune!'
 'We'll stay in sanctuary for now.'
 But we'll come out
to our true place.
 Call it the curse of ambition
 but I only want for you.
 I will restore your good names
and get my boys back.
 I will not stop until it's done.
