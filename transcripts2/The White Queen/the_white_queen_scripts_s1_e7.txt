 The White Queen (2013): Season 1, Episode 7 - Poison and Malmsey Wine - full transcript 
 Edward plans a war with the French but, sensing that too much blood has already been shed, makes peace with king Louis, angering George, who will now not assume the title Regent of France. He becomes convinced that Elizabeth, like her late mother, is a sorceress who caused Isabel to miscarry and who has bewitched her husband. Her two sons also stand in his way to the throne. When Isabel dies he accuses Elizabeth of poisoning her but his public outcries and dealings with Louis lead to his being accused of treason and he is arrested. Despite pleas for mercy from his mother and Elizabeth Edward has George drowned in a barrel of wine. This gives his title back to Henry Tudor, whose mother Margaret Beaufort is now a lady-in-waiting to the queen, thus giving her hope that her son is nearer to becoming king.

 George Plantagenet, I curse you.
 Annie!
 It was a boy.
 You've always been determined to
paint him as a villain.
 He managed that well enough himself.
 You went against us,
down on your knees for Warwick,
 when you thought that he would
make you King. Richard.
 Will you marry me?
 If I marry you,
everything I have becomes yours.
 But I will be a true husband
because I love you.
 The Queen's baby is coming early.
 He's dying, Mother.
 It's a comfort to know that
they're both with God.
 No!
 Lord Thomas Stanley.
 I hope I will please you as a wife.
 I will judge what
I can do for your son
 and, in due course, what
rewards your son can offer me.
 You will be required to take up
a place in the Queen's chamber
 and, to all appearances, be a loyal
 and faithful
member of the House of York.
 Then I will be patient and endeavour
to rise in their favour.
 Edward!
 A toast!
 To my Queen and wife who, even now,
is upstairs, giving birth to
 another son and heir for me.
 The Queen.
 The Queen.
 I can't give birth
without my mother here.
 I'm.. I'm afraid.
 Lizzie, you'll have to, somehow.
Perhaps if...
 If you're going to tell me
to pray again, I swear to you...
 Some lavender from the garden,
Lady Margaret?
 I do not want you in here!
 I think you've made that
plain enough.
 Why are you not with the Queen?
 Oh, she has sent me
on a fool's errand.
 Lavender because her mother said
the scent aids birth.
 Smile, Margaret. We are
their friends
 and you must make her love you.
 And I have tried but she will not.
 She loves only her own vanity.
 I don't believe that this is
the best way to celebrate
 the birth of your child.
 Oh, come on, Richard.
Don't be such a sour mouth!
 Actually, Edward, he's right.
 Half of England's already
calling you a wastrel.
 This is not what we fought for.
 Yes, it is! Peace and plenty.
 It's exactly what we fought...
 Whoring? Really?
What about a legacy?
 Don't you want to be remembered?
I will be remembered.
 Yeah, for being fat and lazy.
 And what do you suggest, George?
 We take France.
 Right the wrongs that mad old Henry
did to this country when he lost it.
 Win back our honour.
 A very sudden interest in the honour
of your country, George.
 Could there be
something in it for you?
 Why not?
You both have enough already.
 If we take... When we take France,
you will need a Regent.
 I could do that,
seeing as you'll be busy being King
 and he's got ten titles as well as the whole
of the North of England virtually to himself.
 Have you been counting, George?
 France. Reclaim our land.
Perhaps we should.
 Stanley... Your Grace.
 He may have forgotten your turn to
Warwick but I have not.
 And I've not forgotten that
you've got Warwick Castle
 despite the fact that that
title belongs to me.
 You both have more
than your fair share already,
 so maybe it's time
I started to take things.
 Give me a sign that
I was right in coming here.
 Lady Margaret? The baby's stuck.
 We must toss the Queen in a blanket.
 That's it! Nearly there!
 Harder. Push! He's here.
He's here, Your Grace.
 Oh, it's a boy!
 My Richard. Where is his cry?
 It's all right.
 Why isn't he crying?
 Am I cursed?
 Will all my children die now?
 Lady Margaret.
 It's all right, Your Grace.
 Help my boy.
 No!
 He lives.
He's all right, Your Grace.
 He lives. You have a son.
 Thank you.
 Oh, you willed my boy to life.
I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm in your debt.
 I only wish to serve, Your Grace.
 How's our boy?
 He is well.
 There.
 He is small but he will grow.
 I am sure of it.
 I missed you.
 But I am so happy here, Richard,
away from the court.
 I feel so hopeful.
 Anne, I have something
I must tell you.
 I've brought someone with me and...
 Oh, Richard, please. Not your
mother!
 They told me you had had a child.
 You didn't bring him
for my blessing.
 My mother cursed me and disowned me.
 Why on earth have you
brought her here?
 George was planning to snatch
her from the Abbey
 so he could steal her fortune.
 He thinks because he has the title
Earl of Warwick that he can
 have all your mother's money
to himself.
 So the King
and I have acted to ensure that you
 and your sister will share
it as you should.
 So to stop George snatching her,
you have done so?
 You do not need to see her.
 You do not
even need to know that she is here.
 She's our prisoner under guard.
 I brought her here for your sake.
 I tried to come and see you.
 You brought me here
so you can steal my fortune.
 You left me on a battlefield!
 I was a child,
alone, in terror for my life,
 and you ran away to save yourself.
 You will release me.
 It is not my will to have you here
but Richard's,
 so you must accept whatever
he thinks best for you.
 Even if I must be dead?
 What?
 It is how we resolve the problem
of your mother's fortune.
 The King will pass an Act
of Parliament declaring she is dead.
 Dead? It is a legal term.
 It means you will inherit your half
of your mother's fortune now.
 Which goes immediately to him
as your husband.
 And Isabel gets her half as well,
 so George cannot steal it all.
 Whilst I am left in purgatory
or is this hell?
 You should be grateful, Countess.
 It is here, the Tower or the grave.
 Anne, you cannot...
You cannot let him do this.
 You must stand with me.
 You betrayed me, abandoned me.
Richard saved me.
 My love
and trust are utterly with him.
 So I have "half"?
 I stand there like a beggar with
a bowl as my brothers
 put their crumbs in it.
 It's always been those two,
since we were children.
 Me out on my own...
 or with my "mother".
 What can I do? How can I help you?
 Please, I want to help you.
 It's all HER fault, the witch.
 She favours Richard and Edward,
simply does what she tells him.
 But we are on your side,
little Margaret and I.
 But now that Edward has his two sons
and Richard has his boy,
 they think that they're untouchable.
 How wrong they are.
 Because when we take back France,
and when I become Regent...
 then Edward will see what
I'm really made of!
 So send out commissions and muster
your men. We will take France!
 Three sons of York!
 And none shall divide us!
 Edward, what are you doing?
 Stirring up another war where
you could die?
 I wish to mark my reign with glory.
 Richard could have honour and
George will take the Regency for me.
 You cannot give George such power.
He will turn it against you.
 He is my brother, Elizabeth.
 And fighting for a common
cause will unite us.
 It will tear you apart.
 If you make George French Regent,
you will regret it.
 Is it good news?
 What, war? Well, good news
if the King should fall.
 But if he doesn't and he becomes
King of France as well,
 he'll have so much power,
 Brittany won't be in a position
to stand against him.
 They would send your son home to
Edward for the slaughter.
 Another war.
 When Edward promised us
an end to bloodshed
 and that our taxes wouldn't rise
again to pay for it...
 Oh, blame his brother, George, cos
he surely talked him into it. Well.
 They must have their war without me.
 I fought enough
when there was reason.
 I will not risk my life for this. No,
Anthony! I'm going on a pilgrimage to Rome.
 Edward needs you by his side
in France. I don't trust George...
 You will not talk me out of it,
Elizabeth.
 Take my advice. You've
made your peace with Lady Margaret.
 Do the same with George.
 Lady Margaret saved my son and
earned her place as his nursemaid.
 George killed our father and brother
 and now he's taking
Edward into danger.
 I'll make my peace with George
when he's dead.
 It frightens me to watch you go.
 I couldn't bear to lose you now.
 It was my brother George's plan.
 I confess, I am troubled
by his sudden call to arms.
 What do you mean?
 The King has said that George
may govern France...
 and I fear that he would
not stop there.
 Perhaps he will be calmed now that
Isabel is with child again.
 And you are not?
 No, but soon. I am sure of it.
 We'll have a dozen babies,
as many as the Queen.
 I don't mind if we don't,
 as long as I have you
and my own honour.
 'Dear Jasper and Henry.
 'The men have gone to
war in France against King Louis.
 'As a dutiful wife, I must pray
for my husband's safe return,
 'but I live in fear of a York victory
that would endanger you.
 'At court, Elizabeth now rules alone.
 'She's like a king herself
and glories in it wickedly.'
 Anne!
 Oh, it's so good to see you!
 Look at you!
 'God's path for me is strange indeed
that I am made nursemaid to
 'her youngest boy for bringing him
to life with my own hands.
 'I cannot bear to tend him
 'as he only makes me think of you,
Henry, so long and far away from me.
 'Every moment that
I spend here is torture.
 'I fear you have forgotten me.
 'Please write to me. I miss you.'
 How is our mother?
Was she vile to you?
 She was angry.
 Richard said we had to bring her
 because George was going to
steal the money.
 He doesn't mean it. He's unhappy,
 especially
since Elizabeth had another son
 and he is pushed even
further from the throne.
 The throne? I thought it was
the Regency of France he wanted.
 Yes, that's what I said.
 If George has something for himself,
then he'll be so much happier
 and everybody wants that.
 Our daughter, Margaret,
and I have disappointed him.
 He blames me that she's a girl,
 but once I have this son for him,
he'll have his heir
 and he'll love me.
 Is your sister telling you her
news from George in France?
 I am worried about Edward.
 George writes only that he
wishes our child would be a boy.
 We'd have an Edward each, then,
wouldn't we?
 My mother bore 14 babies.
 So let us hope that we are as
fertile as our mothers...
 and that our York brothers will
come home unharmed.
 Annie, she just cursed us!
 What? Don't be silly, Izzy.
 She wished we'd have the same
issue as our mother, two girls!
 She just ill-wished our boys!
 Could you hear what
they were saying?
 She said that George wants
the throne and that you cursed her.
 You can't hear witchcraft
in everything she says, Iz.
 She is a woman, just as we are.
 What if she isn't?
 George says that she's a witch.
Father said it, too.
 What if everything is her fault?
 Ever since she sent that storm that
killed my poor baby boy...
 Izzy, please.
 We fear her because of what
our father did to hers.
 We feel his sin.
 The sin is hers. It is all hers!
 And now she casts her evil eye on me
 and if I can't give George a boy,
it will be all her fault.
 We didn't sail here to talk.
We came here to overthrow Louis!
 We came to win back England's honour
 and reclaim the lands
that should be ours!
 All I'm saying is that we should
listen to King Louis's
 terms for peace.
 He said he would offer land,
 so perhaps we could win
without bloodshed.
 He cannot offer us dignity or glory!
 And he won't make me Regent, Edward,
which is what we agreed.
 We agreed on nothing, brother.
 I said that I would think about it
 and yet you act as
if you're entitled to it!
 Argh!
 'Dear Anne, our campaign is a farce.
 'King Louis has offered Edward
terms of peace
 'and he has taken them.
 'His son is to marry Edward's
daughter,
 'so she will be the next
Queen of France, and lots of gold.
 'I cannot forgive him
for this betrayal.
 'I have always been
 'heart and soul for my brother,
Edward,
 'but now I cannot meet his eye.
 'We have become like merchants,
haggling a price.
 'Worse still, George's ambition is
curdling to rage as this
 'peace thwarts him most of all.
 'Edward should beware him
from this day.'
 Our father would cry for shame
if he could see us now.
 It's that whore Elizabeth's fault.
 She'd been writing to him since
we left, telling him not to fight.
 She has England's high
command, not Edward.
 Lady Mother, Father is
back from the war!
 Come on.
 You're home.
 I want you upstairs.
I'm tired of women!
 First let me
show you what I brought you.
 Stanley! Open a chest.
 And for you, my Queen, Malmsey wine.
 I told King Louis it
was your favourite.
 Richard!
 He laughed.
He said I was a fool for chivalry,
 then he stuck his own
nose in the trough.
 Where's George?
 He has gone home already.
 He railed against me
for making peace with France.
 Richard will come round in time...
 but George will barely speak to
me. I think you were right.
 He would have come against me
if I had made him Regent.
 So now both of them
are angry with us?
 I will offer them gold from the
campaign in a hope to appease them.
 So my brother shows his true colours.
He is treacherous to the last...
 but he shall get what's
coming to him!
 But he didn't make you Regent,
so how can you do anything?
 I have made a secret deal with
the King of France.
 I have promised Louis Calais
back for France if he will
 support me with an army to take back
the English throne for myself.
 All I need is my new son and heir
and Louis will support me.
 And what if it's not a boy?
What if it's a girl?
 Or... Or he... dies?
 He won't die. Why would he die?
 Because she cursed me.
The witch, Elizabeth!
 She cursed me that my boys should
die and she's already
 killed my first one
and now she'll take this one, too.
 She cursed our sons?
 She did.
 She did.
But George, please don't blame me.
 It's not my fault.
 She will not take him.
I shall hire a sorcerer
 and we shall fight her fire with
fire and break her hold on England.
 Richard?
 Richard?
 How could he do this to me?
 Now Edward tries to buy my honour!
 He confuses me
with my brother, George.
 He does not even know me.
 Then send it back
 and show him
you do not care for wealth.
 The insult has been paid now.
 Though everything I thought
I knew has been shaken,
 perhaps there's no honour in anyone
and each of us is alone.
 But we are not alone
because we have each other.
 You asked to see me.
 The Act that makes me dead
names you a whore.
 No, the law that names me
dead decrees that Richard may
 divorce you
and still keep everything,
 the land, the castles,
treasure, everything.
 You are just a spiteful, old...
 Oh yes, well.
 Your marriage has been consummated
and you've borne him a son.
 What grounds could that
possibly be for divorce?
 My guess is you didn't get
dispensation from the Pope.
 Am I right?
 You're cousins. You would have
needed it but I think Richard
 urged you marry straight away
and said he would get it later.
 Yes, well, that's because we...
 Richard married you for my money.
 He will divorce you
and take your money.
 So you must leave him.
 We will overthrow the Act
and we'll get my fortune back.
 We do not need men.
 They are all treacherous!
 We will manage our affairs
ourselves, you and me, together.
 You are mad. You are mad.
 You don't believe me.
Ask your husband.
 Ask him!
 Richard is right to shut you away.
 Now stay in here and be dead!
 What a surprise.
 The Queen has betrothed her
common-born son, Thomas, to
 one of the richest girls in England!
 She probably used enchantment.
Shut up, George.
 The marriage isn't even real.
Whatever comes out of that bed
 is only bastards.
Of course it's real!
 They are married in the eyes of God
and that's what counts.
 It's just I wouldn't want anyone
saying such a terrible
 thing of me.
 Annie, you mustn't believe what
our mother said.
 Richard loves you.
 Besides,
you shouldn't be worrying about him.
 You should be
worrying about the witch.
 One of her ladies told
George that she has two names
 written in her locket in blood.
 She's cursed them both to die.
 What names?
 He doesn't know.
What if they're ours?
 George says that she'll kill us
all with her cursing, so he has
 commissioned special charms to be
made that will protect us.
 Er... Lords and Ladies
of the court!
 A toast to our newly betrotheds...
 and King Edward
and Queen Elizabeth of England!
 Edward, you cannot let him
do that to me!
 I'll have my mother speak to him.
 Your mother? You may as well
reward him with more gold!
 Then what do you suggest,
Elizabeth? Truly, tell me
 because if you can think of something that
I cannot then perhaps you should be King!
 George!
 You will not behave towards me
this way.
 Are you threatening me?
 I'm the Queen of England.
 You're a murderer!
You murdered my first-born son.
 You killed my boy with a storm
and I will not let you take my next.
 I killed no-one
 and I will not let you destroy
the court and all we've worked for.
 Shh. Shh.
 I found him in our rooms.
She's trying to kill me.
 George, how do you know it was her?
 Who else could it be?
 She is trying to poison us all.
 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
 Anne,
the Queen has tried to poison us.
 We're going back to Tewkesbury.
 Isabel, come on. What?
 Go to Warwick Castle, Anne,
for me, I beg you.
 For God's sake,
get out of this place.
 She means to kill us all.
 Isabel. Izzy, don't go! Izzy!
 How can he know the dog was
poisoned? The thing was old.
 It could've died from anything.
 Isabel said SHE poisoned it,
the witch.
 You should be resting, Isabel.
 'My dearest Annie.
 'I've had my baby boy, Teddy.
He's a cheruby little thing
 'but Annie, George says the witch
will try and poison him
 'while he's small and weak
so he's paying a sorcerer...
 '..a man named Burdett to
ward off evil spells. Annie,
 'I'm ill. I'm bedridden.
 'George says
the Queen has poisoned me.
 'Either that or it's her curse on me.
 'I'm frightened, Annie. I need you.
 'Burn this.'
 You're too late.
 What do you mean?
 No, Izzy!
 No, no, no. No!
 No.
 Help.
 No.
 Shouldn't we tell people,
so that they can say goodbye?
 Who can we trust, though?
 If this was the Queen's doing, then
I shall have revenge on her.
 I'll talk to the King.
I'll tell him what I know.
 But I know what he'll try to do.
 He'll try to buy me
off with marriage and get me
 out of the country.
 But I won't agree to it.
 Of course I won't.
 I think I grew to love her, Anne.
 I really think I did.
 Anne...
 is it true?
 Your sister is dead?
 Yes. I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry I left you...
 on the battlefield.
 I was afraid.
 Damn you, Edward. George!
Damn you and damn her!
 Edward!
 Leave us.
 George has just accused me
publicly of witchcraft!
 He is spreading rumours
that his wife was poisoned
 and I was the one who did it.
 George is angry because
he cannot have the wife he wants.
 He just asked me
for Mary of Burgundy but I said no.
 Imagine what would happen
if we let him loose with Flanders!
 He is accusing me of murder, Edward!
 And if you're not going to do
anything about it, then
 I most certainly will.
Yes, and what will you do?
 Hmm?
They already say you're a witch.
 Now, unless you want those rumours
to grow, then you must learn to
 rise above the accusations,
for once, and do nothing.
 I will command Anne Neville to
an audience with me...
 and I will scotch the rumours.
 Lady Anne, do you believe
your sister, Isabel, was poisoned?
 She said the dog was poisoned.
 Izzy thought
she wasn't safe at court.
 She feared the Queen
would poison her? I...
 Well, if anyone were to poison her,
it would be George himself.
 She's barely cold in her grave
 and all he cares about is snaring
himself a powerful new wife.
 It is the King who wants him
to re-marry.
 The King?
 And why would the King want
George in Flanders
 when all he'd do is bring
an army to attack us?
 Use your head and think, for once,
you stupid girl,
 instead of listening to his venom.
 I didn't poison anyone.
 So it's true, then?
 That George wants to re-marry? Yes.
 You don't think it could be
him that killed my sister, do you?
 We do not even know
if she was murdered...
 apart from George's
accusation of it.
 She could have
died from child bed fever.
 They were married before God,
so he could not put her aside.
 But now he has her
half of the fortune.
 He is still not happy.
 I want to go and fetch my niece
and nephew.
 I want them here with me
at Warwick Castle, away from danger.
 Happy times for you, then.
 You think I'd celebrate a young
girl's death?
 Well, it's had the effect
you've been hoping for.
 The whole court is dividing.
 And you and your brother will be
on both sides, as ever.
 So who do you think the murderer is,
Margaret?
 I don't know. Most likely
that unholy sorcerer of George's.
 Some concoction designed to protect
her probably ended her.
 So George has a sorcerer?
 How do you know?
 The Queen requests
I listen to court gossip.
 I do not tell her everything I hear.
 Yeah, but if there's one thing
we should tell them, it's that.
 I don't know if it's true for sure.
 Take men to Tewkesbury. Arrest
George. There'll be no warning.
 Do it now!
 Now George has found himself
a sorcerer to counteract
 your "witchcraft".
 Where's George?
 He escaped. We will capture him.
 No!
 What are you doing out here alone?
 Wishing that this river was
a moat to keep my loved ones safe
 and enemies out.
When did you get back? Just now.
 Have you heard?
 George employed
a sorcerer against me
 and half the court thinks
he has just cause.
 I don't know what to do.
 Trust God.
 Pray for his guidance.
 George is on the run.
 We don't know where he'll go
or what he'll do.
 And now we must dance and carouse
 and celebrate Edward's
15 years as King.
 I don't feel like celebrating.
 Smile and behold our most glorious
sight! Follow the creatures!
 Follow the light! Come now
and honour the years of your King!
 Come and exalt him!
Come now and sing!
 Richard, all the men are armed.
 Everyone is siding for or
against the Queen.
 Edward fears she will be
assassinated, given all the rumours.
 But Richard... Wait, Richard!
 Lead on.
 We have examined
the sorcerer's charts
 and it's even worse than I thought.
 George has been
foretelling my death.
 What will you do?
 What can I do? He is my brother.
 Look at her,
acting like the King herself.
 George, you shouldn't be here.
 I'm not afraid of either of them.
 My sorcerer has told me that the
witch will give the Princes
 over to their killer with her own
hand. She will end her line herself.
 George, please be quiet!
 It is forbidden to predict
the death of royalty.
 And to kill a royal Duchess,
to murder your sister.
 They didn't let that stop them.
 The swine is here! I can hear him.
 My friend, Thomas Burdett, refused
the quicker death that he was
 entitled
if he had confessed to his guilt.
 George?
 Now what does this tell you
about that man?
 George! George!
 Argh!
 George, you coward!
 If he had confessed, his heirs could
have inherited, but he refused...
 Where is he?
 Because this man... George!
..this man was innocent!
 So your King, your great King,
your beloved Edward, is a murderer!
 Just as you have murdered before,
eh, Edward?
 When you took a pillow and you
smothered old King Henry.
 And who bade you do it?
That evil witch, Elizabeth Rivers!
 And you killed my wife
and you killed my first-born son!
 Somebody take him. He's gone mad!
And you still don't see it!
 Anthony, Richard, seize him!
 She's dragging this country
to hell... George, stop it!
 And she's taking us all with her!
George, stop it!
 Be quiet, George!
 We are here to try George,
Duke of Clarence,
 who's charged with treason.
 And I shall act as Prosecutor.
 Is there any news?
 They're still giving evidence.
 But everyone now seems certain that
Isabel died of child bed fever,
 not of poison.
 All the focus has shifted onto
George using a sorcerer.
 The King is prosecuting.
No-one is defending.
 Not even Richard.
 Elizabeth, I would like to
leave the court
 and go back to my husband
in the country.
 He cannot do it. Richard,
you must tell him!
 If he's found guilty, he will die.
 The Queen would have him dead.
 She's not forgiven him
for her father and her brother.
 We are the three sons of York.
 How can we be divided by one woman?
 Oh, please, not George!
Not George of all of you.
 Why him of all of us?
Would you rather it was me?
 Would you rather it was Edward who
died and his sons, too,
 just so your precious little George
could have every last thing
 he ever wanted?
 They found him guilty.
You must have heard.
 Is that not what you would want?
 I don't even know
the answer to that.
 Tell me, how shall we find
the strength to bear the wrongs
 people do us?
 He killed my father and my brother.
 He murdered them in cold blood.
 So why should he fare any better?
 Have you known loss, Lady Margaret?
 I've buried two husbands...
 and my only son is forced to
live away from me.
 He is heir to the House of
Lancaster, an enemy to the King, so.
 I do not see him,
was not allowed to raise him.
 He may as well be lost to me.
 And yet you have your faith?
 The Bible tells us
"an eye for an eye".
 But it also tells us,
"Love your enemies,
 "bless those who curse you and pray
for those who spitefully use you."
 Lady Margaret?
 Will you pray with me?
 I would like us
to make peace with George.
 If he apologises and withdraws
his accusations, then I think
 we should forgive him.
 He has been plotting with
King Louis of France to murder me
 and take my throne.
 I have to pass the death sentence.
 You cannot execute him.
He's your brother.
 You've said yourself that he's not.
He planned to kill me.
 Of course he didn't! There's proof.
 George has been disappointed.
You know, it's been so hard for him.
 You will forgive him,
Edward, you will!
 I'm sorry for your loss, Mother,
but I will not.
 You will forgive him. I command it.
 You do not command me.
 I am your MOTHER!
 Yes, and I am the KING!
 You will!
 Oh, God! Oh, God!
 All I can offer is to let him
choose the means of his own death,
 whether it be the sword or
the scaffold or the block or
 whatever he chooses. This is YOUR
work! No, it's not. But he will die.
 Please, Edward! Please.
You're my son.
 You can't do this to me.
You can't kill him.
 Please, Edward! I beg you.
I beg you.
 I beg you!
 I will beg you!
 I beg you!
 Please.
 Please, Edward. Please! Please!
Edward! Edward, please! He's my boy!
 He's my precious boy!
 Please. He's my... Please! Please!
 Edward!
 He wants to be
drowned in a barrel of wine.
 Oh, don't joke, Anthony.
 George, the fool,
has chosen a fool's death...
 a barrel of Malmsey wine.
 He's no fool. It's to punish me.
 Dextera tua erigas, virtute
confirmes, potestate tuearis.
 My sweet boy, George.
My poor, sweet boy.
 Their children will be orphans.
 Orphans and paupers!
Their father dies a traitor.
 His lands will be forfeit.
 And who do you think will get them?
 SHE will.
 Talking to you. This is our own
brother that we're talking about!
 Do you realise how ridiculous
you are being here?
 He's gone too far. I can see that.
 He has committed high treason!
 Cum omni desiderata prosperitate,
restituas.
 Per Christum Dominum nostrum.
 Adjutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.
 Is no-one coming to see me?
My mother,
 or at least my brothers?
 Wait! Wait, please! At least let me
see my brother, the King.
 No! Aargh!
 Agnus Dei...
 Agnus Dei...
 Oh, please!
 Let's go home to Warwick Castle.
 Richard.
 Do you love me?
 Truly?
 Anne! Oh, God, Anne!
 Stanley has asked if Lady Margaret's
son may have his title
 returned to him, now that
George is...
 Why not?
It's one less person who'll hate us.
 This will be the last death, Edward.
You must think of life.
 Think of our children.
 I have good news.
 The King has agreed that Henry
may be given back his title,
 Earl of Richmond.
 He's agreed?
 Seeing as its previous owner
is deceased.
 Perhaps he's feeling
short of friends.
 Will they let him come home?
They have not ruled it out
 but you are at the Queen's bosom now,
 so perhaps you can help
influence her.
 Do...
Do they still fear he's a rival?
 Well, of course he's a rival.
 But who would follow
a stranger over Edward,
 especially when he has his two
beloved Princes to follow him
 to the throne and then his brother,
Richard, and his son, Edward, too?
 Your Henry is going to have to walk
past five coffins to take
 the crown, and I don't know
how he's going to manage that.
 Do you?
