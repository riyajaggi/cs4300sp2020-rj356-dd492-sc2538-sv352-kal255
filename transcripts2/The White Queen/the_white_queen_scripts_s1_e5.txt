 The White Queen (2013): Season 1, Episode 5 - War at First Hand - full transcript 
 1470:- George returns to fight with his brothers, to the chagrin of Warwick, who moves the decrepit Henry VI into the tower of London for his protection whilst Jasper Tudor escorts his nephew Henry to Wales for safety. The possessed Lady Beaufort is angry that her husband Stafford chooses to fight for Edward, seeing him as the lesser of two evils, but both Stafford and Warwick are slain at the battle of Barnet. Edward rides to meet Margaret of Anjou, who has the nervous Anne Neville in her company, and he defeats Margaret and Jasper at the battle of Tewkesbury. Richard of Gloucester exiles Margaret, having rescued Anne from would-be rapists. The Yorkists celebrate their victory though Elizabeth is shocked to stumble upon her family's nocturnal activities.

 We will never see England again. We
are exiles now, like the Bad Queen.
 Warwick has stumbled straight into
the arms of Margaret of Anjou.
 There's nothing in it for her!
 Her husband, Henry,
back on the throne of England.
 Her son and my daughter, Anne,
to follow him when he dies.
 Anne Neville is to marry
Edward of Lancaster.
 When you have secured London,
I will follow to secure
 the rest of the country.
 Warwick has sailed? You're sure?
 It may only be a matter of days.
 I've had word from George.
 He will land with
Warwick's invading army.
 But as soon as we face each other in battle,
he will abandon Warwick and fight by my side.
 Should he wish to return to England,
his brother, King Edward,
 will gladly receive him
and will restore him to favour.
 The King escaped to Flanders with his
brother Richard and Uncle Anthony.
 Is Edward still king?
 I'm no longer queen?
 We are in great danger.
Where is she?
 They've gone to seek sanctuary.
 God save the King!
 God save King Henry!
 Would you like to meet the King?
 Edward is still out there.
Does that not trouble you, Warwick?
 It's a boy!
 We'll never reach England!
 It's madness,
sailing into this wind!
 The captain claims it is safe.
With a blade held to his neck!
 Please, don't leave me!
 You know I can't come.
 You're a princess,
you must sail with the Queen.
 I shall be just behind you
with the fleet.
 What if Isabel was right
and this whole campaign is cursed?
 Father failed to make
her husband king.
 What if he can't put mine
on the throne?
 Your father rests his hopes on you.
Think of him.
 How proud he'll be, calling
his favourite "Princess Anne".
 I do want him to know I'm trying
to play my part.
 Then be brave.
 Do as they say.
 And do not, whatever you do,
cross that woman.
 Where is he? Isabel, where's George?
 Where is he?
 He had a visitor.
 One of his mother's ladies.
 She offered George
a way back to York.
 Full pardon, titles returned.
 If he fought for them.
 I brought you here
to keep him close!
 And now he's joined forces
with Edward?!
 I am not your spy!
 Nor his keeper.
 Your Grace.
 We'll take you somewhere quiet,
 where you may pray for
a happy ending to our worries.
 I must...
 I shall...
 I'm taking the King to
the Tower for his protection.
 The sons of York have united
and mean to take back the throne.
 My Lords,
we heard Edward perished at sea.
 You heard wrong.
 My spies in the North claim he's
landed and is about to attack.
 Go home, raise men
and wait my call to arms.
 I will await Margaret of Anjou's
call to arms!
 And a true Lancastrian
will protect OUR King.
 My Lord, the Duke of Somerset.
 God save the King!
 Margaret, you should go back
to Stafford Manor...
 No, I should stay... for my son.
 No, London will rise up for Edward.
He is much admired here.
 I must go back to Wales
and raise men to fight.
 I need to take Henry with me.
 No... Margaret, you know
what's about to happen.
 He's second to the throne.
He's too vulnerable in London.
 We will go to Wales,
await Margaret's army...
 and prepare for war.
 Edmund?
 Margaret, I'm rather engaged.
 This is in all of our interests.
 You know my husband.
 Henry Stafford. Course. Good man.
 Mm, he's respected.
 And he could, if he wished, raise
an army of tenants for our cause.
 He is not loyal to our King?
 Sir Henry's a "man of peace".
 We all want peace.
Sometimes a man must defend his own.
 Precisely what I've been
telling him,
 only he somehow won't
hear it from me.
 But if a man, close to the King,
were to raise this with him...
 I'm sure I can help him see the light.
 Inform Sir Henry I shall be
joining him for supper later.
 Stay back!
 Edward!
 Thank God. You came back to me.
 Of course I did. I always do.
 How did you get past the guards?
 Warwick has no men here,
they're gathering for the battle.
 Elizabeth, George has been
good to his word.
 The sons of York are... Listen!
 The sons of York are reunited.
 But we must face the Lancastrian
Army in the coming days.
 I can't stay.
 I had to see you...
 see my son.
 He's a fine weight.
 Look, he has your chin.
 He has your wide feet.
 I've been gone too, too long.
 I pray this is not
the only time we meet.
 I will come home,
 keep you safe...
 make this land better for you.
 I love you, little prince.
 Edward! Sssh! Edward!
 Sssh.
 Damn Warwick.
 Making me run like a coward...
 driving me here
to have my son in a dungeon!
 We are fine.
 Be angry, be vengeful,
 but never shamed.
 You ran for your life.
Nobody blames you.
 I've been ambushed, captured,
 but I was never afraid.
 I was... I was young,
fearless, a king.
 Knowing that Warwick
wants me dead...
 Now I have a son
 and I know there will be life
beyond me... Shhh.
 If we win, I will make sure
 this never happens again. When.
 WHEN you win.
 You know Warwick.
 You know him.
You know his ways.
 He taught me everything I know.
 He made me king.
 I loved him.
 Now, I must kill him.
 You're going now,
to fight the York Army?
 What about me?
 Where do I stand?
 You are Lancaster,
George is York, Anne is my enemy,
 and Mother is with her.
 But I am all on my own!
 You will be fine, whatever happens.
 If I win, you've nothing to fear.
 If I lose,
you're still married to George,
 you're still Duchess of Clarence.
 Just be wary.
 Commit to nobody until you know
there is a clear winner,
 and then remind them
of your undying loyalty...
 until it serves you no more.
 John, why are there tenants
in the house?
 Getting their commissions, My Lady.
Sir Henry's taking them into battle.
 Oh, God! Oh, God!
 Oh, God!
 There, My Lord.
 Good day, My Lord.
 Good man. Make your mark here.
My Lord.
 Make ready.
 Lady Margaret. Sir Reginald.
 God bless you.
Oh, bless you, Henry, truly!
 Margaret, Margaret, please, just...
I'm, I'm afraid...
 Oh, no, don't be, don't be.
 You are doing God's work,
for the king he appointed.
 I'm afraid I'm fighting for York.
 I'm leading the men
to serve King Edward,
 because I think he'll win,
put an end to war.
 I know this disappoints you.
 But my, my cousin, Edmund...
you spoke at length...
 He spoke, I humoured him.
 Don't get others to beg
on your behalf, Margaret,
 it demeans you
and you are far more compelling.
 What reason could you possibly have?
 The only time we've known peace
was during King Edward's reign.
 Now he has a son, it's my duty
 to ensure that his succession
is peaceful.
 His success? His, HIS son?
 Look, your house does not
deserve to rule -
 the King's half-mad,
his wife's a tyrant.
 She hates this country
and their son is vile!
 You would defy a king
appointed by God himself?
 Oh, I don't see God in these people.
Look, what I'm doing is right,
 I believe it's right and it's for the good
of all... Not for me, not for my son!
 You, you would have me torn -
husband one side, family the other?
 Margaret, this is not about you,
your ambition -
 this is for the safety,
the future of this land.
 You do this
and I will not forgive you.
 I will not pray for your return.
 You will be dead to me.
 Do you hear me, Henry Stafford?
 You will be dead to me!
 God bless you, Margaret.
 Even though you will not
say it to me.
 Go up on deck and take some air.
 It stinks of bile and fear in here.
 I'm fine, really.
 Really? I've seen heads on spikes
looking healthier than you.
 Just not sure I'd make it.
 Oh, don't be pathetic,
of course you will.
 You want something enough,
you can get it, always.
 Yes, Your Grace.
 You're weaker than I thought.
 I see something of Isabel,
 but sadly, little of Lord Warwick.
 I am not weak, nor like my sister.
 Who are you, then?
I have no sense of Anne.
 And I'm interested to know
what kind of queen you will be.
 Haven't thought about it.
 You're the Kingmaker's daughter.
 You think about it.
 Your husband will face our enemy
at Barnet, north of London.
 There is talk that Warwick
has three times the troops
 and still awaits reinforcements.
 So, Margaret of Anjou has landed?
 Nobody knows where she is.
 But she will have set sail, soon as
there was a break in the weather.
 She could even be marching
to join forces.
 Surely Edward would fall back,
take the Tower, set a siege?
 The King prepares to fight.
 Edward must defeat Warwick
to keep the crown.
 But if the Thames mist
were to rise as high as Barnet,
 who'd even know the army was there?
 Other commanders will ask you to
stay and fight till the death.
 Whilst readying their horses
to flee.
 But let this be my pledge to you.
 I will not ride off and leave you.
 I will stay and fight by your side!
 How many of my ships have landed?
 All but one, although they are
scattered along the south coast.
 Forget Warwick,
we must rethink our plans.
 Your Graces, I come
direct... directly from London.
 Your husband... the King...
 Imprisoned, imprisoned in the Tower,
I know.
 And how heavy were our losses
at Barnet?
 Very. Course they were.
 Let's assume Edward knows we've
landed, that he'll come for us.
 Is my father coming here too?
 My father! What of Lord Warwick?
 Dead...
 obviously, or he would be here.
 On the battlefield, Your Grace,
the most noble death.
 No. No, no, no.
 No, he can't be, he's the Kingmaker.
 He lives to see my son
on the throne... he lives...
 He was a great man. Honourable.
 He killed his own horse to prove
that he would not ride-off,
 leave his men to die. What?
 He fought and fell beside them.
 His forces must be depleted too?
 They have the taste of victory
in their mouths, dear.
 Be ready to move out.
 No.
 I do not run from fights.
 You would face Edward of York here,
with our numbers?
 What would you do?
 Head west.
 My father always said,
 "The south favours York,
 "but west countrymen
have no such affinity."
 Beg them for support.
 We are Lancastrians, we beg
for nothing. Do not speak again.
 It's good, it's good.
 You're thinking like me.
 Does Sir Henry really think
he might die?
 He's badly injured.
 I will go to him.
Reginald, prepare a cart.
 You... you can't ride to a
battlefield, it's not safe.
 Sir Henry would not want it
or allow it.
 Yes, well, I am your mistress
when he's not here.
 You will do as I say. Ready my
horse. No.
 It is hell on Earth.
 It is no place for a woman.
 Take me, Sir Reginald,
or I will go myself.
 Where's my liegeman Jasper Tudor?
Where is he now?
 Pembroke Castle, Your Grace.
 Send a messenger, we head to Wales.
 We'll cross through Gloucester.
 They've a bridge over the Severn.
 No. Gloucester's is in York hands.
They would fire on us.
 All right. Tewkesbury, then.
 They've a ford.
 Could you spare a guard
to take me to my mother?
 You do not want to come with us,
see if your suggestion pays off?
 I must tell her about my father.
 Oh, but she knows.
 She was told first,
by the boy who delivered this.
 She refused protection and took
sanctuary, in Beaulieu Abbey.
 I wish to see my mother.
 She has abandoned you
and lives in disgrace.
 Go to her and you will suffer
the same fate.
 No! We are Nevilles.
 One of the greatest families
in the land.
 Your name means nothing now.
 You will be arrested and York courts
show no mercy to traitors.
 But go, if that's what you want,
 we don't need you any more.
 Yes, you do.
 Your son needs an heir
or your line dies out.
 I could be carrying a future
King of England right now.
 I'll ride with you,
because there's a hope of victory,
 fulfilling my father's wish.
 We need each other.
 Margaret!
 What are you doing here?
It's... it's much too dangerous...
 I'm quite safe. Sir Reginald
and Young John brought me here.
 We have your physician.
 I brought a wagon to take you back.
 Oh, you needn't have...
 So, York won.
 It is all over?
 So I thought.
 But the lad who dressed my wounds tells me that
Margaret of Anjou has landed and is marching to Wales.
 To Jasper?
 If Edward can catch Margaret
and put her in the Tower too,
 then it may finally be over.
 If she reaches Wales,
allies with Jasper,
 they'll go after Edward, finish him.
 Margaret...
 don't do anything to undermine
my efforts or those of my tenants.
 Accept the loss, accept King Edward
 and he'll look favourably on us.
 I'll ask your physician
to bring you fresh bandages.
 If Jasper goes against Edward
and loses,
 he will have to go into exile
once more, with your son.
 Is that what you want?
 Give up, Margaret.
 For once, for once,
please do as I ask.
 Promise me?
 Say it.
 I promise.
 'Dearest Jasper, terrible news -
 'my husband has turned against me
 'and fought for York at Barnet.
 'Warwick is dead and they have
our King, but there is hope.
 'Queen Margaret has landed
and rides to Wales
 'to join forces with you.
 'Invade. Seize this moment and
I will do all I can to support you.
 'For I will never give up.
That I promise.
 'God bless you and keep you safe
from harm. And keep my Henry safe.
 'Guard him with your life.'
 His head should be torn off
 and skewered on the Tower Gates
for all to see.
 That's the only way
to punish traitors.
 Bit rich, George, even for you.
 What was that, little brother?
 You went against us,
down on your knees for Warwick
 when you thought that he would
make you king. Richard.
 You would rather your dear wife
saw her father carved up,
 sent on a tour of England? No.
 Obviously.
 We are here to honour one
of the finest warriors
 this country has ever known.
 He fought with our father
and we would be nothing without him.
 He may have only been
an in-law to you,
 but he was like a brother to us.
 We must remember him
for the hero he was
 and not the traitor he became.
 And we are not savages.
 We were just the ones who put him to
the sword - a touch excessively, no?
 Remember where you are.
 We have won this battle,
but we have yet to win the war.
 And I cannot have this!
 George is loyal to your husband,
it seems.
 Today.
 We may have to forgive him...
 leave our vengeance to God.
 Never.
 Leave us.
 I have to go again, tonight.
 You hope to capture
Margaret of Anjou?
 She is riding west to join forces
with Jasper Tudor.
 Just do whatever it takes
to end this.
 If one battle can bring peace
to England, peace of mind,
 it's one worth fighting.
 And you will be back in no time.
 You have more faith in me
than I ever had in myself.
 I remember meeting a fairly confident
boy under an oak tree, some years ago.
 Anthony will guard you in the Tower.
 But you must stay here
out of danger.
 And who will keep YOU out of danger?
 Elizabeth, if something
were to happen... Don't.
 There's a man in Flanders
who will take you in,
 your mother knows where to meet him.
 You must hide for a while till
the little one is older...
 and he will take the throne.
 You've said all of this before
and you came back to me then.
 You will die in my bed.
 This is what it is to be
Queen militant -
 you have to fight for what you own.
 Remember these odds, this pain,
 for if we win, you will never
have to march again.
 Don't you ever tire
of living like this?
 Never. This is what I live for.
 Even if it means you're hated?
 I've never been liked.
 I'm damned twice
in most men's eyes -
 I'm the woman who dared to rule
when her husband could not
 and who fought to ensure
her only son's position.
 Now, how could I do such a thing?
 Men!
 Why "damned twice"?
 Because I'm French, of course!
 Tewkesbury!
 Once we cross the river,
 we are midway to victory.
 We will join Jasper Tudor's forces,
 return to England
and hunt Edward down!
 May God grant us victory!
 Your Grace. Yes. The river...
 it's too high from this rain...
 And we will all die in the morning if
we are caught this side of the border.
 Edward is closing fast.
 This was your idea.
 We have no option other than
to camp and cross at first light.
 You cannot stay here.
You must take refuge in the abbey.
 Camp here,
then take up the best positions
 and get your men into battle lines.
 Now?
 Edward of York has
the speed of the devil,
 he prepares in darkness,
and conquers in mist.
 You must use every advantage
and be ready,
 be ready to fight for your lives!
 Keep him safe.
 Lady Mother!
 All be very brave.
 Are we being attacked?!
 They've come out the River Thames
for now.
 Who are?
 Lancastrian soldiers.
 Trying to rescue old King Henry.
How many?
 They have warships. So keep back.
 Shh!
 Sister, which way is your chapel?
 Light a candle for the living too.
 Your fate lies with your husband,
not your dead father.
 I will pray for both.
 And for me.
 Edward is my only son.
 Pray God spares him,
for all our sakes.
 How are you? The baby is well?
 Now that it has stopped. And you?
 Tired, my ears are ringing,
but we've withstood all they have.
 For now?
 They've moored their boats,
set up camp not far from here.
 We'll come under siege at dawn.
 Do we have enough men
to resist them?
 The apprentice boys have been flocking in
all night. They'll help to contain them.
 So we just wait for our enemies
to recover, and then storm us?!
 What do you suggest, sister?
Strike back!
 Stopping them from coming
any closer to my family.
 Let's attack them
when they least expect it.
 Most men would prefer to die
in their sleep, would they not?
 Spoken like a true Yorkist.
We attack before dawn.
 Here. Drink this.
 Your Grace, The Duke... Duke
of Somerset,
 he said to tell you
if I thought the battle lost...
 He fled to a church,
but Edward dragged him out.
 And my son? The Prince of Wales?
 I must fetch Your Graces' horses.
 Get a cape, a blanket and bread.
 I'll meet you by the stables.
Shouldn't we wait for Prince Edward?
 Just be ready to leave, will you?
 This is not the first time
I've fled a battlefield
 and it may not be the last.
 No!
 I'm tired, running and doing
what you say, I'm so tired.
 Look at me. Look at me, Anne!
 They will be here any moment
 and men with blood on their hands
are no respecters of title or age.
 We must go. And we must go now.
 When I open the gate, ride hard.
 Don't look to the battle, don't look
back, just get away from here.
 No!
 Don't touch me!
 No, no, no!
 Get off! Don't touch me!
 No! No! No!
 I am Anne Neville!
I am the Kingmaker's daughter!
 No!
 Lady Anne?
 Princess.
 I am Princess Anne.
 Dowager Princess.
 My husband is dead?
 Are you hurt?
 It's over. You are safe now.
 His mother...
 I must tell her.
 I've been charged by the King
to take you into his care.
 His Grace, the Prince of Wales?
 Died...
 in battle.
 Your commanders have been captured.
 I am to take you to London.
 I refuse.
 I don't have to go anywhere.
 I am Queen.
 Now, leave us to grieve.
 I said leave us!
 Get on your horse or I'll have you
bound and gagged
 and thrown into a litter.
 Be grateful the King wants to show
you as a part of his triumph.
 You are bold...
 you're a fine soldier...
 but you're nothing
while your brother lives.
 Come to me, get me out of here
 and I will name you as my heir.
 I will make you King of England.
 You can even have her.
 No.
 I am not yours to give now.
 My boy.
 My boy.
 Jasper plans to take Henry into
exile again, as you predicted.
 Oh...
 I hoped, for you,
it wouldn't come to that.
 What of Jasper?
 He's safe, he didn't reach the
Queen.
 He worries for my son.
 Now Edward has seized power,
 what's to stop him
killing all his enemies at once?
 I would see him and his witch burn
for what they have done to my family.
 Let me to go to Tenby to see them.
 No. No, I can't.
 I have to say goodbye to my boy.
 I know the risks...
 but I don't know
when I'll see Henry again.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 You're a good man.
 My son is the most precious thing
in my life.
 You are the only man
I trust to look after him.
 We fought hard to try
and get to Margaret's army.
 I lost men, good men,
trying to cross,
 and then watched a massacre.
 No, No. You tried.
 God knows you tried.
 Don't talk to me of God, for He was
not at Tewkesbury that day.
 Forgive me...
 And now, here we are again,
 running for our lives,
not knowing when we might return.
 You are safe. My son is safe
 and we are closer to God's will.
 Prince Edward's death puts us
nearer the throne.
 Yes.
 Please God you're right.
 Look after your uncle.
 You have him, he has nobody.
 I will.
 God bless you and keep you.
 We may be beaten,
but that is now. Things change.
 Never give up.
 I won't.
 Forget the Bad Queen,
she does not deserve your sympathy.
 You remember what we called her?
 What will happen?
 Spend the rest of her days in the
Tower, I imagine, like her husband.
 Is that my fate too?
 I hope not.
 Am I not a traitor?
 I married your enemy.
 I'm sure you only did
what you were told.
 Anne?
 When we landed here,
I had a choice.
 I could've gone to my mother,
but I didn't.
 I chose to stay with the Bad Queen.
 You chose to fight on.
 You are your father's daughter.
 Do you love me, Anne?
 What?
 Do you love me... and the King?
 Let's hope that's enough for Edward.
 I'll take you to your sister
when the court returns to London.
 Really?
 I would like to see Isabel,
very, very much.
 Daddy!
 I've sent a messenger
for the priest.
 Henry?
 Glad you're home.
 Here.
 No.
 Your boy, Henry, safely away?
 You must apply for his return later.
 They will not refuse
when they hear about me.
 I know you never wanted to marry.
 And I've disappointed you...
 not suited to the times,
I suppose.
 Stop fighting to be Margaret Regina.
 Just be Margaret
 or Sister Margaret.
 Do whatever makes you happy.
 Perhaps you will pick up?
 Bless you. And your son.
 I wish we could have had our own,
 but I am no less fond of him.
 A fine young man.
 Make peace with the Yorks.
 And bring him home safe.
 For peace, Margaret...
 Girls, girls.
 Edward?
 I'm going to get some air.
 Clear my head.
 I won't be long.
