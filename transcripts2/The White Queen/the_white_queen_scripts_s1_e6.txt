 Where do I stand? George is York,
Anne is my enemy and Mother is with her.
 Commit to nobody until you know
there is a clear winner,
 and then remind them
of your undying loyalty
 until it serves you no more.
 My Father! What of Lord Warwick?
 On the battlefield,
Your Grace. The most noble death.
 I wish to see my mother.
 She has abandoned you
and lives in disgrace.
 Does Sir Henry really think
he might die?
 He's badly injured.
 Jasper plans to take
Henry into exile.
 Never give up. I won't.
 Make peace with the Yorks
and bring him home safe.
 George is loyal
to your husband, it seems.
 Today.
 Am I not a traitor?
 Do you love me and the King?
 Let's hope that's enough for Edward.
 I'll take you to your sister
when the court returns to London.
 I would like to see Isabel,
very, very much.
 Anne Neville.
 Your Grace.
 I beg for your pardon.
 It was not my will to betray you.
 My father ordered my marriage to the
son of Margaret of Anjou
 and she commanded that
I go with them.
 I had no choice but to obey.
 You know that Margaret of Anjou
is defeated...
 and will never ride out against me
again...
 and that her cause had no merit?
 I know that now.
 Well, that is good enough for me.
 I forgive you and I pardon you...
 and you are welcome here at Court
 and you may live here
with your sister.
 Your Grace.
 I am grateful for the mercy
you have shown me.
 But my mother,
she is still in sanctuary.
 Indeed. And that is where
she has chosen to remain.
 Isabel.
 How merciful the King has been.
 You will serve as my
lady-in-waiting.
 You will help me
choose dresses and jewels
 and comb out my hair before I sleep.
 It'll be just like
when we were girls.
 Except that Mother is in prison
and Father is dead.
 Mother is not in prison, Anne.
She is in sanctuary.
 But it isn't true,
as the King claims, that she
 has chosen to remain there.
 Shhhh!
 Izzy, Mother keeps writing to me,
begging me to help her.
 As she helped you
when Father was defeated?
 Mother writes to me, too, Anne,
daily, and ever more beseechingly.
 Ignore her.
 The King must be in no doubt as to
where our loyalties lie.
 Sister.
 Anne is worrying so.
 As well she might, Isabel.
She has suffered much.
 Anne, you will be safe here
and well looked after.
 The King has appointed me
your guardian.
 My guardian? He cannot have
appointed you my guardian.
 I'm old enough to be a widow.
Why would I need a guardian?
 Because you're
the widow of a traitor.
 Edward pardoned her
without a moment's hesitation.
 And after what Warwick did to Father
and John...
 Edward did what he had to.
 You must begrudge Warwick's
daughters their happy reunion.
 England needs peace.
Everything else must be set aside.
 Do not stand there as if a ghost.
 Come! I will let you stitch
the final gold threads.
 Do I have a dowry, Isabel?
 A dowry? Are you
dreaming of marriage already, Anne?
 No, of course not.
I just wanted to understand.
 Of course you have a dowry.
 You mustn't worry about such things.
 The King has tasked George with
taking care of all financial
 matters on your behalf.
 On my behalf?
 When the time comes for you
to marry,
 George will provide
a dowry for your husband.
 What if I do not marry?
 What if Mother dies
and I am not married?
 What will happen
to my inheritance then?
 Isabel,
can't you see what they're doing?
 The York brothers are keeping
Mother in sanctuary
 so they can take
control of her fortune!
 What? Anne, you are quite wrong.
 That is why Richard brought me
here. That is
 why George has had himself
appointed my "guardian".
 It's a plot!
 Do not say these things!
 Do not speak of the sons
of York in this way.
 It's a plot, Isabel.
Can't you see that?
 Silence! You are raving!
 George will keep me here
until Mother dies and then...
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Ow!
 Oh, my Lady! Oh, my Lady! My Lady!
 Go to your room.
 Isabel.
 Biting like a rabid dog.
 Isabel.
 You are not fit to
be in the company of ladies.
 Go now!
 And do not show your face
until you accept the situation.
 No, not "accept". Be thankful.
 With his dying breaths, my husband
told me I must reconcile with them.
 Must I?
 Is that the only way to bring my boy
safely back to England,
 to make peace with York?
 I need a sign, Father.
 I need a sign that even
in my weakness, God hears me...
 My Lady.
 My Lady, I did not mean to
interrupt you at prayer.
 Then why did you?
 I could not wait any longer.
 Your mother, Lady Beauchamp, is
gravely ill.
 Glory, glory, grace of God.
 Margaret.
 Do not weep.
I do not deserve your tears.
 I do not shed any.
 The room lacks air. It smells sour,
of putrefying flesh.
 I am afraid.
Would you seek to make me more so?
 I seek nothing.
 My beloved son should be
kneeling here...
 pressing my hand against his lips.
 But there's only you, Margaret.
 And I will know no peace
until you forgive me.
 Forgive you?
 Absolve me from whatever crime it is
you think me guilty of.
 You ask me to wash you clean of sin
but you do not confess any.
 Is it still Holy Orders?
 After all these years, do
you still hate me
 for not sending you to an abbey?
 You sent a child
to do a woman's duty.
 Do you not understand it was God's
own will that you bear
 a Lancaster heir?
 Of course I understand.
My cause is holy, my purpose divine.
 I have devoted my life to it.
 But you only wished for the chance
to raise your son.
 Is that what you longed for,
Margaret?
 But you also wanted to
marry Jasper Tudor...
 to be adored.
 How you must struggle to reconcile
your saintliness with your vanity.
 Such vanity.
 You wanted to marry for love.
 And what good, pray, would that
have done your cause?
 You should be grateful.
I saved you from yourself.
 God will take you on this
Sabbath Day.
 And when he does, I will be reborn.
 Margaret.
 Margaret.
 Aww.
 Come here, my Prince.
 It won't be so very long before
we see him settled at Ludlow.
 Ludlow Castle?
 Are we to live in Wales?
 But we won't, but our son will
when he's two.
 He's the Prince of Wales.
 He must establish his own
household there.
 And what possible use has
Wales for an infant prince?
 The people must know him
from childhood, Your Grace.
 That way, they'll learn to love him
 and that's how we'll break Welsh
loyalty to the Tudors.
 No. I'm not letting go of my son.
 This is what it means to have a
Prince and not a girl.
 It is simply a matter of choosing
the right guardian for our son.
 Then I will appoint his guardian.
 I'm his mother,
and if he is to leave me,
 then I will choose into whose care
he goes
 and who will raise him into a man.
 It is not simply a matter
of raising him into a man. It's a
 matter of raising him into a King.
 And on that,
you are probably not best placed.
 You may not leave.
 I'll have you both. How about me?
 Summer. A time for mindless pleasure.
 Precious little is mindless where
George is concerned.
 He will have nothing,
nothing at all to do with my son.
 Does George intend to harm the boy?
 I don't know.
 Perhaps it's nothing more than the
pain of being made to part with him.
 When you married into the Royal
House, their customs became yours.
 You understand
that as surely as Edward does.
 I don't know what he understands.
 I only know that the closer
he gets to his brothers,
 the further he feels from me.
 Truly, Mother, we are distant.
Ever since...
 Ever since he came back from battle.
 Not entirely distant, I think.
 Mother, how... How did you know?
 Your husband
is as fertile as a bull.
 Whenever he returns from victory,
a child is never far behind.
 I haven't told him yet.
 Then tell him!
 Leave your cares with me and take
your happy news to your husband.
 Thank you. Thank you, Mother.
 You cheered me.
 Although I think I quite
exhausted you.
 Of course you haven't.
You never could.
 Go. Go! Go!
 Elizabeth.
 Elizabeth!
 Jane Shore.
Her name is all around the Court.
 And what does that afford her?
 I don't know.
That's what I'm trying to find out.
 Have you tried asking Edward?
 And what should I say?
 What on earth is there to say?
 Your husband is a King with
a King's appetites.
 This is his nature, as you have
always known.
 Whoring is merely a sport to Edward,
as hunting is or jousting.
 She is different.
 She is no different.
You are the Queen.
 You flatter her to even
dwell on her name.
 He cares for her. I saw it.
 Isabel? Isabel? Izzy?
 'My dear Jasper.
 'I write to tell you that
my husband, Sir Henry Stafford,
 'died of his wounds...
 '..and my mother, Lady Beauchamp,
is also gone.
 'I am now a widow, and there is
no-one to guide or force my hand.
 'Shall I come to you?'
 I want to see Mother.
 Don't be ridiculous, Anne.
 Tell her, George.
 I'm going this afternoon.
I just need a horse.
 Not today, Anne. No horse today.
 My Lady.
 'Daughter, I greet you well. You
have been at court for many months
 'but I have received no reply or
acknowledgement from you.
 'I am, as you know, in sanctuary to
protect me from our enemies.
 'Use your influence to
restore my freedom and fortune.
 'Your Lady Mother.'
 Husband.
 I will have to keep Anne by my side.
 She grows ruder by the day.
 Anne is not coming to the
festivities.
 Not at all?
 Anne is not going anywhere,
 nor doing anything
without my permission.
 Well, I don't mind if she comes.
It's just that I don't...
 Leave it!
 Anne is still upset, Isabel.
 I do not want her making public
accusations about being imprisoned
 or railing against matters which
have already been agreed.
 We cannot be disgraced in front
of every noble family in England.
 No. No, of course not.
 She will stay in her room.
 Can she attend chapel?
 Of course.
A trip to chapel might humble her.
 Anne.
 You said you were taking me
to safety.
 Let go of me!
 If you're happy living
with your sister
 and being a prisoner here,
then I'll not say another word.
 I'm not. Of course I'm not.
 Come to the yew garden after dinner.
I'll be waiting.
 The children will be
arriving shortly.
 Mother?
 Oh. Forgive me.
I didn't hear you come in.
 No, thank you.
 Are you ill?
 No, no. I just haven't slept.
 In truth, I think I'd prefer to
rest than dance.
 And miss the Christmas
celebrations, huh?
 A year's worth of Court
gossip at a single sitting?
 You must be ill.
 I'll call the physician.
 No.
 I don't need a physician.
 There's nothing
for a physician to see
 and, thank God, nothing that
some fool with a knife
 could think to cut out.
 Then what is wrong?
 My heart. It's beating strangely.
 I feel it skip a beat
and then go slow.
 It won't beat strongly again,
Elizabeth.
 What are you saying?
 Prepare yourself.
I won't be with you much longer.
 His Grace, King Edward,
and Queen Elizabeth.
 Brother.
 Anne.
 Forgive me.
 When I brought you to
Isabel, I thought
 I was bringing you to
a place of safety.
 On my word, I had no idea
what would result.
 George holds me captive here
and you knew nothing of it?
 I did not.
 For six months, no-one, save my
sister and her ever-present
 flock of ladies, has seen me
from one day, one week, to the next.
 Didn't you wonder where I was?
 I did more than wonder.
 I asked after you, often, but was
always supplied with some excuse.
 A cold. A chill.
 Oh, truly.
 Until I demanded to see you
and George said that I could not.
 Oh? And what was I ailing with?
 Grief.
 George told me you were too
deep in mourning for your husband
 to be in mixed company.
 This confirmed what
I already suspected,
 that he has been holding you here,
keeping you out of sight.
 They will keep me here until my
mother dies and then George,
 my loving guardian, George, will
inherit the entire Warwick fortune.
 Providing he can keep me
locked up and unmarried,
 everything will go to him.
 Oh, George.
 It is not only your avaricious
brother.
 It is my sister, colluding with him.
 She is my gaoler, dispatching her
ladies to watch over me like hawks.
 They will hold me here
until they have broken my spirit
 and I submit to my fate
without complaint.
 Listen to me, Anne.
 You must buy yourself more
freedom by going along with George,
 by pretending to
go along with George.
 Flattery always works.
 He responds to nothing more
sophisticated than flattery.
 Isabel, too.
 That will at least gain you some
freedom for now...
 till the time is right for me
to approach the King and ask him
 to release George's
guardianship over you.
 You will approach
the King on my behalf?
 Yes, if you would like me to.
 Why would you do that?
 Why do you think?
 You cannot leave me now.
 Are you in any pain?
 No. There's no pain for me
except in knowing yours.
 What do you see? Tell me.
Please, Mother.
 I must know. What is our future?
What is...
 What is mine and Edward's future?
 You will have another boy.
 Of that I am sure.
 And what a boy he will be!
 I'm sure of that, too.
 Then get well and stay with me.
See... See him born!
 You've been with me
through everything. Everything.
 I would not be here without you.
 None of us would be
here without you.
 And yet, here you are.
 And through you and your children,
I will have founded a line of kings.
 And queens, too, I think.
 I'm not ready.
 No-one is ever ready.
 'My dear Lady Margaret...
 'I'm sorry for your losses
and hope to comfort you with
 'the knowledge that your son is safe
and grows up strong.
 'There is no need to come to us.
 'Your path to help
Henry must be in England.
 'These are dark times for Lancaster
but we must remain steadfast.
 'Entertain no doubts, Margaret.
 'Only redouble your efforts
on behalf of our Tudor King.
 'Your servant, Jasper.'
 Sir Reginald.
 My... My Lady...
 I have decided to marry into York.
 I want you to go to Court and make
delicate enquiries on my behalf.
 Certainly, My Lady.
 With whom?
 I will entertain only the very
closest of the King's confidantes.
 Only a man right at the heart of the
York Court is of any value to me.
 May I ask who, among the King's men,
you have in mind?
 His brother.
 George of Clarence?
 No, you fool. Richard.
 He is not betrothed.
 I do not think
I am looking too high.
 Izzy, you were right about Mother.
 There was no need for me
to rush to her side.
 I am getting used to it here.
 It was hard at first but...
 It looks lovely on you.
 You have the perfect
complexion for it.
 Well, if you can behave like this,
Anne, then there's no
 need for you to spend quite
so much time in your room.
 Perfect. You're a killer!
 You are leading the hunt, I believe?
 I can barely walk.
 Has the King relented over
sending baby to Wales?
 No. He has not and he will not.
 Well, he knows how you
feel about George.
 He wouldn't defy you
and appoint him. As for Richard...
 I want you to take my son, Anthony.
 You are the only one
I can trust with him.
 They will never accept it.
 I do not care what they will accept.
 Will you do it?
 Of course. Of course I will.
 I will guard him with my life.
 Oh, well,
let's hope it doesn't come to that.
 There.
 Go on. Go on.
 Your Grace, Lady Beaufort is a most
devoted mother to the last
 Lancastrian heir.
 All Lady Beaufort seeks, Your Grace,
is a peaceful England.
 You escaped.
 If this is escape,
I cannot imagine captivity.
 Did you enjoy the hunt?
Only, I couldn't see.
 You were right at the back.
 Ah, yes. Well, there were interesting
matters to attend to
 at the back.
 A proposal to discuss.
 What proposal?
 A marriage proposal.
From Margaret Beaufort.
 Margaret Beaufort? She's ancient!
 Ancient and ugly and fanatical!
 Perhaps she is
 but she is also one
of the wealthiest women in England.
 Well, if that is your motive
for marriage, then perhaps you're
 not so different from your brother.
 Anne.
 Anne.
 If I were not a prisoner here,
my fortune stolen from me,
 I, too, could marry any
man of my choice.
 I suppose you have yet to
approach the King?
 I told you I would do it when the
time was right. That has not changed.
 You can count on me, Anne.
 No. It's all right.
Attend to your marriage prospects.
 I don't need your help.
 I have learnt to rely
only on myself.
 Brother. May I speak with you?
 Of course you may.
 I should like to know, if I wished
to marry, how I would go about it.
 Your year of mourning is not
yet at an end, Anne.
 It is a little unseemly to be
discussing remarriage until it is.
 I'm sure I do not intend any
disrespect, brother,
 merely clarification on what
exactly is my position.
 Your "position"?
 This question of marriage seems to
give you much concern.
 It really appears to have
you quite upset.
 Anne, what are you doing?
What is she doing?
 If you prefer it, I'd be happy to
arrange for your place in an abbey.
 Yes. Now I see that that might
suit you quite well.
 Yes, far better than
remaining here with us.
 You would let him do this?
 You would let him send me
to an abbey?
 Go to your room, Anne.
 Isabel, please.
 Can't you see what he's doing?
 He is going to lock me
up like he locked up our mother.
 You will never see me again.
 Isabel! Isabel!
 The Duke of Gloucester has declined.
 Richard was not suitable anyway.
 He's as loyal as a hog,
as loyal as a dog.
 There... there is
another possibility, My Lady.
 Who?
 A man, not of the King's kin,
but as close to him
 as it is possible to be.
 Lord Stanley.
 That turncoat.
 Born faithful to the
House of Lancaster,
 yet switches his allegiance to York
after the Battle of Towton.
 What would I want with
a traitor like that?
 My Lady, it is less treachery
than strategy.
 At every battle, Stanley
and his brother divide
 and join opposing sides,
ensuring that there is always one
 Stanley who wears
the winning colours.
 Arrange a meeting.
 My Lady, there is
more news from Court.
 Jacquetta, the Queen's mother.
 What about her?
 When I left, she was not expected
to last a week.
 Impossible.
 Surely, among her armoury of spells
and curses, there must be some
 amulet or other ensuring her
continued presence on this earth.
 It seems not.
 What are your intentions
for Anne Neville?
 Why? What are yours?
 What do you think they are?
 Well, you're not attracted to her...
 which can only leave a motive no
more honourable than mine.
 You might fool Edward, little
brother, but you can't fool me.
 Stay away from Anne Neville.
 Of greater concern is
the Queen appointing
 Anthony Rivers as the guardian
of Prince Edward.
 When?
 Your Grace, what a coincidence.
 We were just discussing your poor,
dear mother,
 hoping very much that rumours of her
dreadful state have been...
 exaggerated.
 Can I help you with anything,
Your Grace?
 No. Thank you. Goodnight.
 Were you looking for your husband?
 I believe he's with
Jane Shore tonight.
 Please. Just... just wait a moment.
 It is for Richard,
the Duke of Gloucester.
 He is my friend since childhood.
 Take this.
 But the Duke of Clarence...
You need to get it to him tonight.
 Anne. Richard.
 George is going to put me
in a nunnery.
 Of course he is.
 Perhaps I should not have
confronted him. I played my hand
 and I should not have. Now his mind
is made up and it is hopeless.
 No. It's not. It's not hopeless.
 But you cannot go back there.
 George will not hesitate to do what
he has threatened.
 Anne, running away may be the only
way through this,
 seeking sanctuary.
Then I'll go. I'm ready to go.
 Anne... Anne. You must be sure.
 I am sure. I'm not the little girl
you knew, Richard.
 I've grown up.
 Margaret of Anjou taught me
not to hesitate.
 She told me there would be times
when I have to see the best
 thing for myself
and take that course without fear.
 Anne?
 What is it?
 Will you marry me?
 You will get my fortune.
 If I marry you,
everything I have becomes yours.
 It's true.
 Marrying you would make me a wealthy
man, just as you marrying me
 will make you a royal duchess
and equal to your sister.
 But I will be a true husband
because I love you.
 You love me, Richard? Truly?
 I do. Perhaps I always have.
 Anne, will you marry me?
 Yes.
 Annie.
 Anne?
 My Lady, Lord Thomas Stanley.
 Lady Beaufort.
 I hope I will please you as a wife.
 I thought it was an arrangement that
would suit us equally.
 It was clever of you to think of it.
 I believe my advisor made it
clear to you that
 I wish for a position at Court?
 Indeed, he made that plain.
 And did he also convey my desire...
 my intention that there be no
issue from our marriage?
 Fear not. Your spiritual gifts
were lavishly detailed.
 I am well briefed.
 You wish to live as a nun.
 I hope that is agreeable to you?
 Perfectly. I have sons already.
 No need to try for another with you.
 Tell me, how old is your boy now?
 He's 15.
 That your son has a legitimate claim
to the throne is beyond dispute.
 Little wonder Edward prefers him
where he is.
 It is only with the King's favour
that I can bring my son home.
 It cannot be rushed.
 I will judge what
I can do for your son
 and, in due course, what
rewards your son can offer me.
 As for Jasper Tudor...
 Edward will never
reconcile with him.
 Henry will have to leave him behind.
 I believe I made it clear
to your advisors that you will have
 to serve the House of York,
King Edward and Queen Elizabeth?
 You will be required to take up
a place in the Queen's chamber
 and, to all appearances, be a loyal
 and faithful
member of the House of York.
 There can be no shadow of doubt or
anxiety in their minds,
 from the first day until the last.
 Will they accept me at Court?
 They're eager to heal
the wounds of the past.
 Then I will be patient and endeavour
to rise in their favour.
 My own brother!
 She's run off with him
and I've been betrayed by my own.
 It's a betrayal.
A sly and wanton betrayal.
 He has no right, no right whatever
to take up with her.
 I am her guardian, and if he wants
to marry that... that girl,
 then he should have
sought my permission. And what is
 a greater transgression is that he
should have sought yours, too.
 What is it? Why are you laughing?
What's funny?
 Because I cannot resist.
 I do not remember you asking
my permission
 before you married Isabel.
That is not the same.
 Your Grace.
 I seek your blessing to marry
Lady Anne Neville.
 Did you tell her that you loved her?
 Was it as simple as that?
 Edward is the King. It is
his choice, not mine.
 Not now.
 Your Grace,
the Queen's baby is coming early.
 The midwife says
she may not survive it.
 You would go and leave this
unresolved?
 Settle this pettiness
between yourselves.
 Stand aside!
 Come on, breathe.
 He's come too early.
 His breathing is weak.
 He's dying, Mother.
 Take care of him for me.
 No...
 Good evening.
 Good evening.
 Now would be the moment, yes?
 Were it not for your express
stipulation that such
 a thing should be
avoided at all costs.
 Fear not, Margaret.
 I am more than happy
to respect your wishes.
 Goodnight.
 I worried George would intercept
my note, stop you from coming.
 All financial matters have been
resolved between he and Richard,
 so I doubt he'll mind what I do now.
 I'm sorry.
 It is in the past.
 I wrote to Mother
to tell her about my marriage.
 She sent back a curse.
 Anne, you don't need her blessing
 and you cannot be
harmed by her curse.
 You have a husband that loves you
and you have me.
 And I will never let you down again.
 Will you come and visit me?
 We are going to
live at Warwick Castle.
 You're going home.
 Of course I'll come.
 Don't cry, Anne. Don't cry.
 Oh, Izzy. I have missed you.
 It's a comfort to know that they
are both with God now.
 There was a moment when I thought
you were gone from me, too.
 Only one moment?
 Then you're lucky.
 When you broke sanctuary,
I stood by your side.
 When I saw you smother an old man
in his sleep, I stood by you again.
 I never doubted you...
 until I came into your room
that night.
 This?
This is what has been burdening you?
 "This"?
 You lay with her like you loved her.
 Like she could
so easily take my place.
 Neither she nor any other woman
could ever take your place.
 Well, she did take it.
 The night before my confinement,
you were with her and not me.
 Elizabeth, you knew
when you married me
 that I would not be a husband that
would faithfully sit at your feet.
 We are not young any more.
 We are not those two people who
met on the side of the road.
 They are gone.
 Then what remains?
 What remains is my love for you.
 You are what sustains me in battle.
 You are my home.
 Sweet.
 The Prince of Wales will make
a fine horseman.
 Your Grace.
