 The White Queen (2013): Season 1, Episode 9 - The Princes in the Tower - full transcript 
 Aware of his antagonists Richard rewards those whom he believes can serve him, including Stanley, the duke of Buckingham and Thomas Brackenbury. Anne visits Brackenbury behind her husband's back, expressing her fear that his throne will not be safe as long as the princes in the tower are alive. Elizabeth, fearing for the boys' safety, accepts an offer of help to rescue them by Margaret, whose son Henry is now betrothed to Elizabeth's daughter Lizzie. However the attempt fails and, learning that the boys are dead, Elizabeth believes that she was double-crossed by Margaret in her ambition to see Henry crowned king. In fact Margaret and her kinsman Buckingham lead a rebellion against Richard but it fails, due to a torrential rain-storm magically evoked by Elizabeth. Buckingham is executed whilst Stanley, who betrayed his wife's part in the revolt, is awarded her lands as she is arrested and exiled. Anne believes Brackenbury had the boys murdered and she and Richard are alarmed by rumours accusing him of organizing the crime. Richard visits Elizabeth and expresses feelings for Lizzie but she tells her mother that she has no wish to be used as a political pawn.

 Word from your mother, Henry.
 The King is dead.
 And we must be ready to raise an army.
 We're to escort the King to the
Tower for his protection.
 Secure the Prince's safety.
 What's stopping him
from snatching my other son?
 We must get you out of here tonight.
 We must find a boy
that's the very image of you.
 We're going into sanctuary.
 Richard, Duke of Gloucester,
plans to make himself King.
 Parliament declared your marriage to
Edward of York invalid
 and your sons as bastards.
 Lady Margaret, I need your help.
 We must free
Prince Edward from the Tower.
 We're working with her to get
the Princes out of the Tower.
 Well, then, Henry must
strengthen his claim, marry well.
 Princess Elizabeth.
 Your ambition will be
the death of the boys.
 I will restore your good names
and get my boys back.
 My affinity, my kin,
my loyal men at arms.
 I am the rightful King.
 You are guardians of my kingdom,
the men whom I rely on.
 Sir Robert Brackenbury,
 now Constable of the Tower.
 Harry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham...
 Lord Chamberlain of England.
 Lord Thomas Stanley,
 Lord High Constable of England.
 And in place of Anthony Rivers...
 the Order of the Garter.
 I swear my fealty to God
 and King Richard.
 I'm grateful for your loyalty.
 They will be loyal to us, Richard.
 You are the rightful King now
and England will grow to love you.
 London is against me still.
 They will come around.
 The North is loyal
and soon the South will follow.
 And when the time is right, we will
invest our boy as Prince of Wales
 and England will
blossom in your York sun again.
 Thank you, Anne.
 Nobody wanted a Rivers boy
on the throne whose mother would
 tear England apart.
 Do they think that if they ring
the bells for days on end,
 it will
make his coronation less a sin?
 England will not accept it.
 They love Edward's boys
 and Richard is a fool to think
he can usurp Prince Edward!
 Do you still have no word from
Prince Richard in Flanders?
 The letter may have gone astray.
 Or perhaps we have sent him
to his death.
 Elizabeth! Maybe we shall all die,
now my father's gone.
 No-one else will die, Elizabeth!
 I've had word from Buckingham.
He's, um...
 He's told me what his terms are
for joining us against the King.
 I'll tell Elizabeth and we'll mount our
attack on the Tower to save the princes.
 Does she trust you?
 Yes. Once you've rescued her boys,
she'll rise with us against Richard.
 Those boys are still a problem,
though.
 Richard naming them as bastards
made no difference.
 The first in line to the throne.
 The people still support them. I
know. Anne and Richard know it, too.
 But perhaps that might provide us
with a solution.
 Lady Anne.
 Sir Robert.
 I did not think to see you here.
 We are shortly
on our royal progress,
 but I should like to have sight
of those boys before I go.
 What will happen to them,
Your Grace...
 now that both of them are here?
 They can be neither boys nor men
because just by living,
 they are a threat to us.
 We hoped by declaring
their illegitimacy, that they
 would lose their power,
but people still support them.
 Would you wish them killed?
 I can't wish it -
not a pair of innocent boys.
 You are too tender-hearted, then...
 because boys become men...
 and even boys can be a cause
that men will kill for.
 Then, I do wish it,
 else how will the King and I
ever be safe?
 Spiritus Sancti...
 I've received a message
from KING Richard
 that if we were to leave
sanctuary and go live at Grafton,
 then, my boys would be
returned to me.
 He says he would have peace now.
 Do you trust him?
 Of course I don't trust him!
 He killed my son
and my brother Anthony!
 My boys must be released to me
before I leave here.
 Take care, Your Grace.
 Lady Margaret fears the King
would play you false.
 She says the Duke of Buckingham
believes it, too,
 and that he is so aggrieved, he is
ready to turn against King Richard.
 Buckingham will turn?
 As evidence of his good faith,
he will storm the Tower with you
 to free the Princes.
 And what is Buckingham's price, hmm,
for betraying his dearest friend?
 The Duke asks that his eldest
daughter should marry your son,
 Prince Edward,
and that he himself be named Regent
 until the young King is of age.
 And no doubt
she wants her exiled son,
 Henry Tudor, returned to England.
 And Princess Elizabeth's
hand in marriage to Henry,
 and that Henry is named heir
after your Prince Edward.
 It means your daughter could be
Queen,
 and Lady Margaret says that such
a marriage would unite
 the Houses of York and Lancaster
and end these wars.
 Tell them I will accept,
 but my boys must be rescued
straight away,
 and my son, Thomas Grey, he will join
the raid to see that all goes well.
 Send this note to him
to come to see me.
 Your Grace.
 'Dear Henry and Jasper,
I greet you well.
 'I have much news.
 'We are to free Elizabeth's boys
from the Tower
 'and then she will bring her army
against Richard.
 'You must make ready.
 'Whoever wins must find you landed
in force, Lancaster rising,
 'your troops ready
to fight a second battle.'
 My Lord?
 As you were, gentlemen.
 'I think this is our moment.'
 I have selected the men who will
join in the attack on the Tower.
 I have to know your will.
 My will is God's will.
 When they break down the door of the
Princes' room,
 is it your will or God's will
 that they slice their
little heads off there and then?
 Elizabeth's own son,
Thomas Grey, will be there,
 as will her man, Sir John.
 Kill them all.
 This is YOUR plan
to put YOUR son on the throne.
 If the Princes are dead,
then he is two steps closer.
 The people will not choose
Henry over them.
 I brought the little one to life
myself.
 War is hard.
What are your commands, my Lady?
 You would have me order the deaths
of two boys, only nine and 12?
 Well, say the word
and we will rescue them
 from their wicked uncle
and free the Queen, too.
 Would you like the royal family
of York restored,
 with a little Prince Edward
on the throne?
 Stop it. Well, then, you must choose!
Save or slaughter?
 Hmm?
 Which is it to be?
Save or slaughter?
 Obviously, the men must kill them.
 Father, the men are waiting.
 Do you know your orders?
 Yes, Lord Stanley.
 I must join the King.
 Wait until the men have reached
the gate, then send the letter.
 What letter?
 To Sir Robert Brackenbury at the
Tower, warning him of the attack.
 Warning him? So we are seen to be
on Richard's side if it goes wrong.
 Father.
 It won't go wrong!
 Stanley?
 Oh, Thomas!
 How do I fare as a fisherman,
Mother? It's so good to see you.
 Sir John. Thank you.
 I have been in mourning
for the King, your Grace,
 and aggrieved at your boys being
taken from you.
 You will watch them on the raid,
won't you? Buckingham and Stanley.
 Both are on the King's royal
progress.
 The King trusts no-one
so he's taken them with him.
 It's their men we're meeting.
 At least it shows
he has no true supporters.
 Mother?
 If Henry Tudor and Buckingham are
really on our side, we cannot fail.
 Richard will not stand a chance
against us all united.
 Just bring my boy to me.
 Be ready to leave when we send word.
 Thomas? John? Take care.
 Your Grace.
 Your Grace.
 Close the gate! Thomas, quickly!
Intruders in the camp!
 Secure the door!
 Edward! Thomas!
 Edward, you must be brave!
 We're coming for you!
 You must be brave and wait!
 Be brave and wait!
 Shh!
 Thomas. Sir John. Why...?
 We failed.
 The boys were better guarded
than we thought.
 The man who should have let us in
was cut down.
 You didn't even get inside?
 We tried to ram the door
 but the guards came from the
courtyard and we had to fight them.
 We heard doors slamming and shouting
as the boys were taken further in,
 but once we were discovered, there
was no chance we could get to them.
 I shouted to my brother,
"You must be brave and wait!
 "We are coming for you!"
He did not answer.
 My boy!
 Thomas, you're hurt.
 We must call all-out uprising.
 We must hope for a quick defeat
 so we can reach the boys before
they come to any harm.
 I'll write to Lady Margaret
and tell her to raise Buckingham.
 And do you trust your newfound
friends, Mother...
 who suddenly flock to rescue the
boys and yet don't quite succeed?
 Because all of them feast quite
merrily at Uncle Richard's table.
 I cannot choose my allies,
Elizabeth.
 And to save my son,
I would plot with the Devil himself!
 I think that you already have.
 Richard, what is it?
 The Rivers have attacked
the Tower...
 the moment we're in the North
and miles away!
 Sir Robert Brackenbury has
written to me.
 She did not get the Princes out?
 They're not Princes any more!
 I'm sorry.
 Your Grace?
 Your son, Lord Strange,
he found out and sent a warning.
 It came too late
but I am grateful to him.
 You must punish those concerned
and show no mercy.
 The boys are safe
under lock and key.
 It is HER and no-one else.
Of course it is!
 But how does she still have men
she can command?
 The boys command them
by their very living.
 We must have our boy
invested Prince of Wales.
 We'll do it here in York,
then there can be no question
 who is next in line
for the throne.
 Why could we not reach them?
 You want the boys to live?
 I am your obedient daughter, so
if it is your will that they should
 take the throne and not my son,
then you need to give me a sign.
 You need to give me a sign
right now!
 They botched it, then.
 If my son hadn't sent
his warning letter,
 Richard may well have pointed
his finger at me.
 How do I know it wasn't your son's
letter that caused us to fail?
 Richard plans to move
the Princes to the North.
 Once he does,
we'll never get to him.
 So you need a new plan quickly.
I have a plan!
 I just don't care to share it
with you
 in case you send any more letters.
 I risked my neck leaving
the King's side to see
 if this thing can be salvaged.
Do not exclude me now!
 I'm meeting Buckingham.
He has access to the Tower.
 Get them out.
 Do you think we must try again to
free the Princes
 and restore them to their state?
 If they were legitimate,
then of course.
 But Richard says they're not,
 so perhaps you'd risk everything
just for a witch's sons.
 Perhaps we might.
 I do fear for their lives, though.
 Richard will surely want them
out of the way
 now our plot to free them
came so close.
 You don't think
he would murder them?
 God forbid.
 Though if he did, it would mean
the end of the Rivers line.
 That would serve her right!
That witch, Elizabeth,
 who made me marry her yokel sister!
 Or if someone else were to kill them
in Richard's name,
 then who would doubt
it was really Richard's doing?
 And you, of course,
have access to the Tower.
 And the rebellion that overthrew him
 would leave the throne open
to someone...
 new.
 But, of course,
you mean your own boy, Henry Tudor.
 Henry is direct Lancastrian heir.
It is his birthright.
 And if, God forbid,
 your Henry should fall in battle?
 Then, you would be King,
 as you would
if he should die without issue.
 But if he should live,
then you will have his gratitude
 and any price you name.
 Will you take my fealty to your son?
 I swear my fealty to God
and to King Henry Tudor!
 On behalf of my son, Henry Tudor,
 the rightful King of England,
I accept your fealty.
 Let us overthrow Richard
and his Standard of the Boar
 and bring joy back to England.
 Shall I really be King one day,
Father?
 Yes, Edward.
You will be King of England.
 I don't want to be King
if you will die.
 I won't die for a very long time.
I promise.
 And I always keep my word, don't I?
 Richard, Edward. It is time.
 Thomas sends word that no-one has
seen our brother
 or the changeling since the raid.
 Our letters are returned to us
with the seals not even broken!
 And now Richard has made
his own son Prince of Wales.
 And that usurper will die for it!
 Haven't enough died, Mother?
 It is his birthright, Elizabeth,
the throne of England!
 And this is my LIFE and my sisters'!
 Lizzie, don't!
 You coop us up here like rats while
all you do all day is plot revenge!
 Elizabeth!
 You want the throne, but do you
even have a boy to put on it?
 No.
 Queen Elizabeth? Your Grace?
 Thomas!
 With love from Flanders.
 Richard! He's safe!
My Prince Richard!
 'My dear Jasper and Henry.
 'Our London house is now the secret
headquarters of our rebellion.
 'Dr Lewis goes between Elizabeth
and myself almost daily
 'as she, in turn, draws out those men
still loyal to the York Princes
 'and signs them to our rebellion.
 'My spies report that Buckingham's
men are secretly arming,
 'as he promised, and will meet you
when you land in Wales.
 'He and Elizabeth think that you will
land your men in Tenby to
 'join them. They do not know
you will be off the coast, waiting
 'until their battle with Richard is
over so you can defeat the victor.
 'Only Richard, far away in the North,
has no notion of the plans
 'that are forming at the very heart
of his own capital.
 'And when the time comes,
he'll have no idea what hit him.'
 What's wrong, my love?
 I thought once the boys were
disinherited, we would be safe,
 but Henry Tudor is betrothed to
Princess Elizabeth, our niece.
 How do you know?
 Lord Stanley told me.
 I fear I must reprimand my wife.
 I thought
she'd respond to my authority but...
 The Tudors
and Elizabeth are in alliance?
 They're planning a rebellion.
 I must insist the Duke of Brittany
hands Henry Tudor over
 before he can attack.
 Thank you for your loyalty,
Lord Stanley.
 Your Grace.
 Your Grace.
 Richard, Lord Stanley would let you
lock up his own wife!
 How do you know you can trust him?
 He says he's loyal to me.
That's the thing with Stanley.
 No-one ever really knows
whose side he's on.
 You must arrest Lady Margaret.
She has betrayed us!
 Don't tell me what to do!
 I have enough enemies as it is.
 I cannot arrest a woman who is
notorious for her piety
 or I'll create a dozen more!
 Richard, you must not let this come
between us.
 We stand together
and then we are strong.
 I know. I'm sorry.
 I will intercept her letters.
I will set my spies on her.
 We will learn more that way.
 And if Brittany won't hand
Tudor over?
 He will invade
and I must prepare for war.
 Margaret.
 Margaret!
 I can't stay long.
The King trusts no-one any more.
 He knows there's a rebellion
in the making and he suspects you,
 and therefore me as well.
 So tell me quickly,
are the Princes dead?
 Yes.
 Have you seen the bodies?
 Of course I have not!
 How do you know they're dead?
 Because the Duke and I agreed it!
 How do you know he hasn't lied to you
 and Buckingham holds them
somewhere safe?
 What would he have to gain
from that?
 He wants them gone as much as we do.
 So you'd better be loyal.
 You'd better fight for Henry.
 It is Buckingham!
 My own true friend who is behind the
rebellion of Margaret Stanley's!
 I've intercepted her letters.
 Richard!
 Leave! Your Grace.
 A man with the best cause
to be true,
 I have given him everything
he's ever asked for.
 And never was a traitor
better treated.
 And now he is joining Elizabeth
and Henry Tudor,
 who is mustering to sail
from Brittany.
 Buckingham is false.
Lady Margaret too.
 Elizabeth we expect,
but all of them together...
 Now I must postpone my Parliament.
 Just when I'd called for it
and prepared.
 I just want to show England
what a king I can be
 and how I planned to serve them.
 And you will still show them.
You'll defeat this uprising.
 That is not even the worst of it.
 What? What is it?
 Buckingham is spreading a rumour
 that the Princes in the Tower
are dead.
 What?
 By my hand.
 It is all over the city.
 But why would they say that?
 Because Buckingham slanders me
to win men to his cause.
 And ARE they dead?
 It's not true.
 You know I have not harmed them.
 You know I would never do that.
 Would someone else have done it?
 They will be safely in the Tower.
 I have written to Sir Robert
to be sure.
 But now I must prepare for war.
 Sir John.
 I offer you my sympathy, your Grace.
 We prayed for the Princes,
and we hoped to rescue them in time.
 We are more sorry for your loss
than I can say.
 My loss?
 What?
 God spare me.
 Don't say you didn't know,
and I've just told you like a fool?
 Are you saying that my son,
Prince Edward, has been executed?
 All I've heard is dead.
 No. No.
 Forgive me
for being the one to tell you.
 All we wanted
was to know your wishes now.
 He has not been executed. No.
 Not publicly.
 We were just told the Princes
had been put to death,
 God save them, and the rebellion
would go on against Richard,
 but now we would put Henry Tudor
on the throne.
 Margaret Beaufort's boy?
 We mustered for your cause,
your Grace.
 Who told you they were dead?
 A man of Buckingham's.
 The false King had ordered
their deaths in secret.
 Listen to me.
 Go back to Kent
and tell your men to rise up.
 Tell them to destroy
this false King Richard
 and to take vengeance for me
and my poor boys.
 Buckingham and Tudor are to meet
in Wales.
 They will cross the River Severn
to invade.
 I must cut them off
and rout them there.
 May I give you a wife's blessing?
 Come back to me, my Richard.
 My love.
 There's a rumour
that my boys are dead.
 The Duke of Buckingham is saying it.
 I fear, your Grace,
it is more than just a rumour.
 The false King Richard has killed
his nephews to secure his throne.
 At least my Richard is safe, though.
 He's safe?
 They are both safe, please God.
 But they haven't been seen
since the Tower attack.
 The Duke and Lady Margaret
both believe
 that Richard had them killed.
 But why would Buckingham tell
the men
 in the very moment we muster them
to free my boys
 that our cause is already lost?
 So that everyone knows it was
the false King Richard who gave
 the order. That he's to blame.
But who would doubt it was Richard?
 No-one would doubt it, of course.
 Your Grace...
 what did you mean when you said,
"At least my son Richard is safe"?
 Doctor, if you had two rare jewels
and you feared thieves,
 would you put both of them
in the same box?
 Richard was not in the Tower? Hush!
 But two boys were killed
in their beds!
 In their beds?
 Were they?
 You know that for sure now?
 How do you know it?
 Please! How are you suddenly
so very sure? Your Grace, I...
 If you had the slightest hand in
this, then you will go to hell
 and so will Lady Margaret!
 Mother, what's happened?
 Elizabeth?
 Have you heard the river singing,
as it did when Anthony
 and your brother Richard Grey died?
 Not like that night.
 But you hear something?
 Faintly.
 Like a lullaby. Don't you?
 No.
 No.
 They're saying that your brother
Prince Edward is dead.
 No. No.
 Mother...
Lizzie, I think I was mistaken,
 and that the people who I thought
were on our side
 are our bitterest enemies.
 And all our safety now depends
on Buckingham
 and Henry Tudor losing this battle.
 I thought King Richard was our enemy
 and that's why we rose up with them
against him?
 Richard stole the crown
 but I think it was Buckingham
and Lady Margaret who killed my boy.
 I must write to my son and Sir John
 and tell them
that we are changing sides
 and that they now must turn
against Tudor and Buckingham.
 Elizabeth summoned me
to sanctuary tonight.
 She begged me to tell her
that the Princes are not dead.
 I didn't know what you would have
me say
 so I told her what everyone
is whispering,
 that Richard had them killed.
 But, Lady Margaret,
she said something else.
 Tell me.
 She said,
"At least my Richard is safe."
 Prince Richard, how can he be?
 She looked at me in the most
determined manner and she said,
 "Doctor, if you had two rare jewels,
would you put them in the same box?"
 She would say nothing more.
 She became most angry
and I took my leave.
 Lady Margaret, is it true?
 Are the boys both dead?
 They are like all of us,
in the hands of God.
 Goodnight.
 Lady Margaret?
 Mother?
 I can't sleep. Nor I.
 Where are they meeting?
Buckingham and Tudor?
 In Wales, to cross the river.
 Then, we must do something.
 I wish that it would rain.
 Let it rain.
 You must not worry
about your father.
 He will be home soon
and we'll all be safe again.
 Buckingham's army will wait in Wales
for Henry Tudor.
 Lady Margaret will know that her son
cannot set sail in this.
 Not if it's this bad
over the Channel.
 And it will be.
 5,000 mercenaries.
 A force that cannot fail against
whoever wins the first battle.
 Except we cannot even get there
for the rain.
 'My dearest Anne.
 'I am in hell.
 'Our march is slower than torture,
 'the horses chest-deep in the mud,
 'and half the bridges
are washed away
 'so we have to go for miles
to find a ford.
 'My men march with their heads down.
 'When we rest, we can't light fires,
as everything is soaked.'
 Buckingham will give up his wait
for Tudor.
 He will be forced to fight Richard
on his own.
 'Buckingham's life will shrink
to a long march in the rain.'
 'He will pray God for a miracle.'
 But not in this rain.
 'There are no miracles.
 'And God is raging at what
they have done to my poor boy.'
 'Lady Margaret.
 'Your son has not arrived to join
me, and most of my men have fled.
 'I cannot win against Richard with
these numbers, and he knows it,
 'and is hunting me.
 'When I am routed, he will build
a scaffold for all the traitors,
 'and he will search the Tower
for the Princes.'
 Edward?
 Richard?
 Guard! Quickly, man, open the door!
 Your Grace.
 Richard?
 What are you doing?
 You must sentence the traitors.
 They are gone.
They've just vanished.
 The boys!
 It'll be that witch!
She will have spirited them away.
 That is why you must drag her
out of sanctuary and punish her!
 I've searched every room
and stairwell.
 Where can they be?
 Richard, please!
 Name the traitors
and call your Parliament!
 It's what you've always wanted!
 Do the good for England you've
dreamed of and then we can be happy.
 The guards said
they put the boys to bed one night,
 and in the morning they were gone.
 Sir Robert Brackenbury
raised the alarm.
 Sir Robert?
 What did Sir Robert say of it?
 That he was sorry.
 He is sorry.
 So, where are they?
 Then it must be Buckingham.
 Surely it must.
Who else could it be?
 Will you ask him...
 if he has killed them?
 I will execute Buckingham
 for ruining my good name
and my peace...
 by accusing me of
murdering those boys.
 He knows.
 Richard knows you've been
working with the Queen.
 You're guilty of treason...
 punishable by death.
 If... if he thinks
that you're faithful?
 I AM faithful.
 While you were betraying him,
I was at his side.
 Richard's shocked!
 He feels you're as faithless
as your kinsman Buckingham.
 He's been executed.
 What do I do? I...
 I cou... I cou... I cou...
I could, I could run away?
 I could go to Brittany?
I have... I have my money chest.
 But I've been nominated
as your jailer.
 Richard's decided
that all your lands
 and your wealth will come to me.
 My men are in your chambers now
removing your goods
 and your money chest.
 And your wine.
 You are robbing me?!
 You led me to the plot to rob me!
 You'll be under house arrest
at my country house at Bletsoe.
 Your servants will be dismissed,
you will not meet with anyone.
 You betrayed me to get my fortune.
 No, Margaret. I've saved you
from a traitor's death.
 And I'm still in place to hear
of Richard's plans against your son.
 You signed his death warrant
with your failure.
 You can write to him, but all
your letters should come through me.
 I must have the appearance
of controlling you completely.
 The "appearance"?!
 You'll give the appearance
of being on both sides!
 Always.
 Sister, let me in.
 You're not my brother!
 I am the King.
 Not to me.
 Let me in, Elizabeth,
for all our sakes.
 Tell me, please.
 Do you have your son Edward
and his brother somewhere safe?
 They're not in the Tower?
 In God's name, if you have,
I swear I will not hunt them.
 Just tell me that they are safe.
 No.
 No.
 Everyone is saying they are dead
and that I did it.
 And did you?
 Think, Elizabeth.
 When we killed King Henry,
we had his body shown to the people.
 The whole point was to tell
the world that his line had ended.
 If I killed your sons...
 I would have done the same.
 I am sorry for your loss.
 You have nothing to gain now
by staying in sanctuary.
 I'll make you an agreement
and promise for your safety
 and that of your girls,
if you come out.
 I shall go home?
Be under house arrest.
 I cannot trust you
not to come against me.
 I cannot trust anyone, anywhere.
 You have grown beautiful, Elizabeth.
 Lizzie, Cecily, leave us.
 People are saying
that I killed your brothers...
 but I want you to know
that I am innocent.
 You have my word.
 Whoever killed my sons,
I will curse them.
 We will both curse them...
 down the years,
until all their sons die out.
 Take care.
 Your curses last too long...
 and may turn on someone you love.
 Bless me, Father, for I have...
 I do not know what I have done!
 I'm afraid I have done something.
 I...
 I said things to someone...
 and what if he has acted
upon them?
 What if I killed two little boys?
 What should I do?
 Read it aloud. Melusina will take
the curse and see it's done.
 Our boy Edward was in the Tower.
 But he is gone
and we think he is murdered.
 We come to you, Lady Mother,
 and we put into your depths
this curse -
 whoever took our firstborn son,
 you will take his firstborn son
from him,
 and his grandsons too,
 and his firstborn boys
all down his line.
 And we will know the murderer
by the workings of our curse.
 Burn it.
 Lizzie, come, come.
 Richard, what are you doing?
 Parliament is waiting for you,
my love.
 Elizabeth doesn't have the boys.
 She doesn't know where they are.
 You have seen her?
 I had to know.
 I had to ask her.
 What did she say?
 She said she would curse
whoever killed them.
 She cursed us? Not us!
 I did not order their deaths.
 How could you think that of me?
 I've said Elizabeth can come out
of sanctuary.
 What?
 She will go to Grafton
under house arrest.
 The older girls will come to court.
 I want to keep Princess Elizabeth
close to me.
 What are you doing?
 They are witches!
 She rose against you
and only God's rain saved you.
 Please, Richard!
 Richard?
 What is happening to us?
 Thomas Grey sends his love
from Brittany.
 He's fled to safety
at Henry Tudor's court.
 Lucky him!
 Well, I take it I no longer need
to marry Tudor?
 Now we think his mother killed
my brother Edward.
 I've written to Lady Margaret
that your betrothal still stands.
 Wha... What?
 Mother... Lizzie, it was you
 who told me you foresaw
you would be Queen.
 I said that I feared it!
 Not that I wanted it!
 Henry Tudor could be killed
the moment he sets foot in England.
 But he will come.
 He has his army
and he will not waste it.
 He will try again
for the throne of England
 and we have not sacrificed this much
to step aside if he should win.
 I will not marry him, mother.
 No matter what you say.
 Fortune will send me someone else.
