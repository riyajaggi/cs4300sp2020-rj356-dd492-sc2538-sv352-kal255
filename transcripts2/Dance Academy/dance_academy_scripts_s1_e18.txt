 Dance Academy (2010–2013): Season 1, Episode 18 - Betty Bunheads - full transcript 
 Scout re-enters Kat's life when she auditions for the junior summer program at the academy, with Christian helping out. Abigail's meanness shifts off Tara when Petra becomes Miss Raine's clear favorite, but setting her up for a fall proves Petra a stronger and more capable adversary than Abigail expected. Meanwhile, Sammy wants but can't get Abigail to be open about their kisses-in-the-closet love affair.

 Previously on Dance Academy... Not bad. We killed it. I've got a bunch of dance freaks that would kill to come to a taping. You promised. I can't risk these kids with someone they can't trust. You have everything and you rub it in my face! I'm so sick of that self-righteous attitude! Girls. Enough! But the thing is... I need you. You obviously think I'm stupid, otherwise you wouldn't have checked to see if I cheated.

 Interesting. It's another thing you're brilliant at. This is Petra Hoffman, on exchange from the Berlin Ballet School. Your new roommate. Look at Petra's lines. Lovely. Lovely training. Can you take a photo of us, Abigail? Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru Before I left home Mum gave me the talk. Not THAT talk. She was worried one day I'd regret missing out on being an ordinary teenager. I told her point-blank that there wasn't any choice, because who wants to be ordinary when you have the chance of becoming a professional dancer?

 Taurus. The dream you desire is within your reach today. So she's staying? It's an online horoscope service, people. Can we get some perspective? So you don't want her to stay? No, of course I do. I just don't think that the little horoscope man inside Kat's phone knows exactly what Mr Kennedy is saying. No? Mr Kennedy made it very clear. - He wants me to stay! - Yes! I'm so excited. So, well, he said that... Typical Lieberman. You're a walking safety hazard. I'm... I'm running real late. But that's great news, Petra. Careful. You don't own the barre, Armstrong. Um, I... I could go... Or we could just both... It's OK. Ready for pliés. Everyone, step out. I want you all to watch Petra. See how she maintains her line. Miss Raine's actually smiling. Can you see the look in her eye? I think it's love. Definitely the new favourite, don't you think, Abigail? Auditions for the junior summer school program continue this Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. A roster will be on the notice board. If your name appears there, you have volunteered to help me. I'm allowed to be here. Lucky you. Please, don't let me stop you. Barbecue flavour's better. You might want to try chewing. Yes, Mum. Is she here? My sister. You know, I liked to do my own thing when I was your age. Junior summer program, huh? If I get in. My shoes kinda suck. Alright, come with me. You'd never believe how many shoes the girls here go through in a week. Do you mind? We were... I was just helping Abigail. How's he helping? Um, I think she was having trouble breathing. Right, Sammy? Yeah. As you were. What are you waiting for? Go stop him before he tells the whole school. Stop laughing. This is a disaster. People are going to find out about us. What do you mean 'us'? This is just this. It doesn't make us 'us'. OK, so what does this make us? Nothing. How'd Tobi take the news you're staying? He didn't say it, but he wants me to come home. It must be really hard for them to think that you'll be staying here so much longer. Mmm, not that. The company in Berlin, they want me to start in the corps straightaway. Wow, that's huge! That's child abuse. You're still a student. I haven't accepted. Why not? You could be a principal by the time you're 20. You're easily good enough. It's like they heard I was having some fun and they got together to take it away from me. Teen snatchers. They're the fun police. You know what? Being a teenager for the first time in my life, that's my only dream right now. I like a girl who's got her priorities straight. Guys, I'll... I'll catch up with you. I just want to say hi to someone. And step to the right and curtsey, and to the left and curtsey. Thank you, girls. Very good work. Now, when I call your number, please stay behind for your callback time. 5, 6, 9, 18. The rest of you, keep dancing and come back next summer. Miss Raine, Scout's a natural. Scout? Number 14. Right. She's flexible but there are physical limitations. She just hasn't been trained properly. She also has a very bad attitude. That is something that can't be fixed, as we both know. Yes, Abigail? I'd like to volunteer to help with the junior auditions. Oh, you can do the rosters. Just make sure you include Petra. I think the young girls could learn a lot from a dancer like her. OK, Petra's Sydney summer experience starts now. First, we need to camp out for Vibrant tickets. No, first, boyfriend. All these pictures of other people kissing and none of me. We need to remedy that. I know who I like. He's your best friend. Do you think there is a chance? Sammy?! Really? Is he seeing someone? No! We'd know! So it could be me. Yeah. I could totally see you and Sammy together. Aren't we generous? Looks like we've volunteered for tomorrow afternoon. Isn't that good of us? I haven't volunteered at all. That's so unlike me. Hey, so we're all free this afternoon. Why don't we do something? That might be fun, Sammy. I... I've got to stay here and finish this history essay, so... Oh, come on. History's not going to change. Do it tomorrow while me and Petra are volunteering. OK. I could never get my leg that high at your age. Look, Scout, I know I really screwed up with those tickets, and I'm sorry. It happens. You know you were as good as those other girls that got a callback. Then why didn't I get one? Well, you're not a prissy little Betty Bunhead strapped into her ballet shoes. I know I had the wrong clothes. No, you had a personality, that's why. Anyway, I knew I wouldn't get in. I just wanted to see what it looked like inside. Grand battements have to look like you're not even aware your leg's up next to your ear. And quiet. No banging down. You know what would really help? Practising in front of a mirror at a proper studio. What's the point? What if I got you another audition? I won't flake out on you again, Scout. Lauren Lancaster Hall? Who is that? Me! Lauren. Alright, number 20. Abigail, have you seen Petra and Tara? No, I thought they were supposed to be helping you this afternoon. I thought so. Well, I was just off to do some extra practice, but I could always help. Could you? - Alright, girls. - Those of you with a number, follow me. The rest of you, line up for Miss Raine. OK. Soft arms now, floating in the breeze. I'm really sorry I ever told you. I can't believe your ballet teacher never let you learn. Injuries. Can't risk it. Yeah, it's a crime. My bike meant freedom. They stole that from you. So what if I fall? Who cares? How many fouettés have you fallen out of? Yeah, we'll catch you. Ready? Let's do it. You got it. You're riding. - I'm riding. - Keep pedalling. How can I stop?! Onto the grass! That was close. You alright? Yeah, I am. The sky's never this blue at home. But you have snow - white Christmases and reindeer and ice skating, everything sparkling and glamorous. And freezing cold. I'd love to see snow. You've never seen snow? Hey, you've never ridden a bike. True. I've never been on a plane. That's why I can't wait to join the company and go on tour. I'm the opposite. I've always wanted to join the Berlin Ballet so I can stay close to Tobi. He's sick, yeah? Cerebral palsy. But we don't see him as 'sick'. He's the coolest person I know and my best friend. That's why I want to stay close. Yeah, I want to kill my little brother most days. That too. I think I'm going to go take a walk. Yeah, I'll come. Alone, because Petra's story really moved me. So you stay here. Talk to Petra. All that chocolate. I think I need the exercise. See the line your foot is making? Watch the mirror. I am! Come to help, have you? What are you doing? She's good. She deserves a second chance. And you're the one who's gonna give it to her? What's your problem? I've been the project before, OK? I know what it's like for people to come in and help. But what happens to that kid when you get bored? Hey, Christian, thanks for giving me these shoes. I look like a real ballerina now, huh? You were saying? Alright, forget all that pretty tutu stuff. You're going to hurt in there like nothing else. Do it slowly. Work through the pain. Hold yourself. Again. Just like a ballerina. OK, what do you think you're doing? What are YOU doing? What? Petra. She likes you. Oh. No, really? Yeah, you made it obvious enough. So? Look, I don't need your help. OK? Good. Uh, excuse me. Open-door policy. I don't want to get in trouble for breaking the rules. Somebody's interested in me. Nothing's happened yet, but you should be aware that I now have options. Good for you, Sammy. Yeah, so I need to know what this is. 'This'? Are we ever going public? What, like holding hands and 'swapping chewing gum under the monkey bars' public? No, that's not what I mean. Or matching public tattoos - "Sammy and Abi 4 eva". Even better, in Chinese characters so it's more cultural. Maybe I should just go out with Petra, then. Petra? Yeah, because at least I know where I stand with her. So what are you waiting for? Why won't you admit that you like me? OK, am I that embarrassing? You are at the moment. And where were the two of you yesterday afternoon? But we're on today. Then how do you explain this roster? I'm especially disappointed in you, Petra. I can see it's better that you remain a student. You're clearly not ready for adult responsibility. But we... Yesterday could've been a disaster. I'm just pleased that Abigail was able to cover for you. I know it's in here somewhere. Wow. She's like the most beautiful dancer I've ever seen. That's my mum, Natasha. She is a self-obsessed diva who only cares about her career. I get a card from my mum sometimes, even money if it's my birthday. So who do you live with? My sister. Well, my half-sister, actually. I always wanted a sister. Hey, what's this? Oh, that's an old concert I did. Which one are you? That one. What a Betty Bunhead. Hey. Oh, here it is. You sure you want to be a bunhead? Wow. OK, I'm officially creeped out. What are you doing? You saw that picture. All they do is squash you down until everything you loved about dance is gone. I'm not you, OK? OK. Well, then, looks like Operation Scout is go for launch. Alright, girls, let's keep warm. What about a polka? Everybody hold hands and face me. Point your right foot and hop. She's in. We make a good team. No, not THAT kind of team, just... Um, so, my party and the... Oh, yeah. We never talked about it. Mistake, obviously. Yes. Not that it was bad or anything. No, not bad at all. Just not like that... Yeah. Totally. Yes, Scout's in. Excuse me, I have to speak to Miss Raine. There's a problem with the head count. If you tell Miss Raine about Scout, I'll tell her you switched the rosters. I have no idea what you're talking about. I know you did it. I'm just not sure why. Can't handle not being the favourite? I'm not here to be the favourite. The way I hear it, you're here to get Sammy to be your boyfriend. You know why I am a better dancer than you, Abigail? You're not a better dancer than me. I dance because I love it and because I can, not to be the best. So you'd rather stay here for love than dance professionally? I heard you turned down the company in Berlin. You know what the really sad thing is? If you put the same amount of effort into ballet that you put into being mean, you'd be a much better dancer. And five and six and seven, eight. And bend and stretch, join your feet, lower your heels. And bend and stretch, join your feet, lower your heels. And bend and stretch and turn. Stop. And you are? Number 15. Scout. You're not on my callback list. Quite a transformation, I must say. Are you going to kick me out? Well... perhaps there was an... administrative error. Now that you're here, you might as well stay. Alright, we'll start again from the beginning. Six and seven, eight. Bend and stretch, join your feet, heels down. At least summer school will give you a chance to figure out if you hate it here. Like the pain. Christian said there was a lot of that. Christian said that? Uh-huh. He's the guru. Well, we'll be here, me and Kat and Petra. We'll help. Not me. I'm going back to Berlin. I accepted the company's offer. What about our summer? I want to be near my family and it's such a big opportunity. I might not get a second chance. At this exact moment, my friends back home are getting ready for the Year 10 formal. It's all they've talked about for months. I'll miss you. Here, Sydney snow. 'Bye! For my collection. Sometimes I dream I'm back there, living my old life, and when I wake up, just for a second, I wonder if I made the wrong choice. That's how I'll remember you. But I don't think so. - 'Bye! - 'Bye. 'Bye! - You enjoy that? - Yep. Are we going public now? Nope. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru
