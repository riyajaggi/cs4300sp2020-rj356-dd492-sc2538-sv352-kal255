 Dance Academy (2010–2013): Season 1, Episode 11 - One Perfect Day - full transcript 
 Two students stumble on control issues. When cheerful kid sister Paige visits, Abigail strives to domineer their entire time together, but Paige, being 11 years old, will have none of it. Ethan wants to charm and impress Dana, his mentor, so asks Tara to be the principal in a new solo piece of his, whereby he micromanages her into the ground. The only one not having a control issue is Sammy, who happily conducts a sea funeral for his much-despised "girl" shoes.

 Previously on Dance Academy... Let me get this straight. They're forcing you to wear girls' shoes? Tell you? Who you've got a crush on. No! It's Abigail! You can't be serious. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I said like a gazelle, not an elephant. Go to the back. I'm sick of you. I taught Sammy all I can. I need someone who's at my level. Abigail, the problem isn't just Sammy. He had to do all the work because you're a sack of potatoes. I don't know if that's the best idea, you and me going out.

 Oh, it wouldn't have to be a date or anything. - Dana Strong. - Hi. I loved 'Symbiosis'. The intensity just blew me away. Why do you want this? Because it's my passion, my absolute passion. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru Shoulders down, Tara. On my sixth birthday, I begged my parents to let me have a princess party. Ribs, Tara, and get your head straight. For months I dreamt about my dress, the cake, all the presents I'd get. You're trying too hard. Don't dance apologetically. But when the day finally arrived, I remember I spent most of it crying.

 Tara! It wasn't the party's fault. We'd borrowed the neighbour's pony and Dad had decorated the backyard in pink streamers. The problem was me. Alright, stop the music. I can't imagine why you think I'd want to watch that. Where's your artistry? You told me to focus on my technique. Surely it's possible to do more than one thing at a time. We've been here before. If you're going to cry, you can leave the studio. I'm not crying. I want you to dance to the mirror. Be critical. Expect the most from yourselves. OK. Music, please. No matter how good my party was, it couldn't match what I had in my head. That's the thing about expectations. You're always going to be a little disappointed. Virtual hug. Back at ya. So how come you're late? I wanted you to watch Saturday class. Mum's trying to miss her plane. Dad would freak if she did. You think? Anyway, it's cool they've gone away for the weekend and we get to hang out. Yeah. Hey, there's this really good Pilates class on tomorrow morning. It's at 7:00. Do you want to come? Do we have to? Any final words? There is no curse too terrible. So I booked the studio for us. Be good for you to practise for your audition. I don't want to be a dancer anymore. What? You've always wanted to be a dancer. I want to be a rhythmic gymnast instead. Paige. Paige! Kat! Podgy Paige, you gorgeous thing. Oh, let me look at you. No-one calls me that anymore. Yeah, I can see why. Little sister of Abigail? Younger sister. Well, you have just made it in time for the funeral of Samuel Lieberman's hated pointe shoes. Actually, we're just about to go to the studio. Abigail, it's a funeral. OK. This is it. Farewell, ye old enemy. Unfortunately, I knew you well. You can do it. You've gotta hope they don't choke a pelican. So I don't know if you know, but my dad's a choreographer. I did my Master's on him. I am a fan. Right. Well, see, his work... I want to do the opposite. Oh. Don't get me wrong. He's a genius, but his sensibility's more about emotion, and I'm more about ideas. Like what? Well, I'm thinking, like, a postmodern meditation on, like, the nexus between youth and technology. OK. So I start with these kids and they're obsessed with communication. They're playing a video game, but what they don't realise is the game is actually... Controlling them. Yeah. Yeah. We're just so on the same wavelength. No, I... I saw something in a festival. Oh. Ethan, I don't want you to worry about trying to impress me. I'm already impressed, otherwise I wouldn't be here. OK. So what is it you want? Find some inspiration from life, not what's clever. Bring me something from in here. - Wait. Stop. - What are you doing? I'm going to do a little dance in dedication to Sammy's shoes. Oh, good idea. Yeah, I'm honoured. Guys, put some music on. Do you have to? - We really have to get going. - Yeah. Alright, back it up. Back it up. Whoo! Work it, Paige. I used to be the ribbon champion at my old school. Really? Have a go. Really? Yeah. Whoo! Go, Tara! Hey, fruit bat. Um, I booked this studio until 10:00. I saw. I came to talk to you. Really? Um... Hi. Hi. So... So I need a dancer for my mid-year choreography assessment. Oh, did someone pull out? That's terrible. No, no-one pulled out. I'd be creating it for you. It's a solo piece. I get it's a lot of work and late notice, but I thought... Any chance you'd be interested? Yes. I mean, um, not uninterested. Excellent. Studio one, 10:00am? Yes! Wow, a solo. Mm-hm. Is he going for that raw, amateur thing? It's contemporary. I'm about to have the most perfect day of my life, and there's nothing you can do to ruin it. I think you'll be brilliant, Tara. Thanks, Paige. You better get ready. Our schedule is jam-packed. I've organised for us to watch the company take class and then a tour of the Opera House. I can hardly wait. Alright, you want to come to the studio and stretch with me? I'm hungry. You'll never be a gymnast if you don't stretch. Did I say gymnast? Oh, yeah. I meant journalist. They don't stretch. Pay attention now. That is disgusting. We're going to Luna Park. You don't mind, do you? Paige was crying child abuse. She's never been, so... Actually, I put a lot of time in planning this weekend and Luna Park wasn't part of it. Ow. Too slow, old man. Sammy's gonna come if I get him three times in a row. No, I'm not. Ow. That's twice. I can Paige-sit if you want to stay here. That's not what I said. Really? So you're going? Ow! Three times. Well, I guess someone better look after you lovely girls. So after the Ranger we go over to the dodgems, depending on how we're doing for time. If we make a plan, we'll be able to maximise the day. I want to stand in the middle, spin around and go on whatever ride I point at. Yeah! Just fight the urge to control everything, Abigail. It's the mouth. Whoo! We're nearly there. We're nearly there. I want to go on the Ferris wheel. This is good. This is good, except for that picture. It's artistic. More Picasso than Monet, but... Yeah. Oh, hi. You must be Tara. Hi. All warmed up? Yeah, yeah. Of course. Great. OK, so I don't want to get too literal, but this piece is kind of about a girl who's caught between her two selves, who she is now and who she's going to be. And tell me, why did you pick Tara? She's a first-year, so, technically, we are limited to what we can do. No offence. But what she's got is this quality, just like the girl. I mean, when she's dancing she's not self-conscious about anything. She's free. OK, good. Well, let's get started. - It's huge. - Whoa. Want some? No, I have my own. OK, we're gonna go over there. Come on. I'm the king of the world! - Two, one... - Go, Paige! Whoo! Come on, Abigail. Ready, Abigail? - Alright. Oh, yeah. - That was so good. Come on, Sammy. We're coming. Sammy! Hey, do you mind sitting next to Paige on the next ride? Why? You're not going to declare your love for Abigail? 'Cause my stomach's already fragile after that. It's... Well, it's Paige. What? Think she might have a little crush on me or something. Dude, get over yourself. She's been flirting with me. She's 11. What do you think? I mean, we could go from a renversé into a pas de bourrée and then the attitude turns. Might make it more fluid. Mmm. What does Tara think? Sorry, did you... Renversé into pas de bourrée, then into the attitude turns. Got it. Perfect. Wait. You're not really feeling this, are you? Well, um... Feel free to talk to me. This isn't class. It's the attitude turns. Maybe I could do a posé instead of a chassé? Really? I can't see that working. You know, it might. Why doesn't Tara give it a go? Yeah. OK, good idea. Sure. It's a matter of getting perfect timing. Virtual hug? Back at ya. Hey, Sammy, look at this. Yeah, it's a big dog, isn't it? Apparently I'm due for a growth spurt. Hey, Sammy... Yeah? Guys, check this out. Whoo! Oh, look. Look, there's two of me. - What are you looking at, Abigail? - Nothing. OK, guys. Who wants fairy floss again? Alright, girls. That was fun. Yeah. There she is. Dana, over here. Oh, she's busy. She's incredible, isn't she? Uh-huh. So you know with your choreography, how you, like, plan everything out in advance? Yeah? I used to think that if I did that with my life, like, visualise every moment, I could make it happen the way I wanted it to. Are we talking specifics or...? I guess it's like... having a crush on someone. You imagine every moment. You end up chasing around some poor guy 'cause you just don't understand how it doesn't happen the way it happens in your head. Well, at least it's honest, putting how you feel out there. Can't say that about a lot of people. Yeah, it's a personality winner. Hey, I'm sorry if my head's all messed up today. It's just so rare that you can actually talk to someone, you know, like you're on the same level. Yeah. Yeah, it is. She's incredible, isn't she? Yeah, she's... perfect. Want some? Oh, no, thanks. Go on. No, that's alright. He doesn't want any, Paige. It's full of processed sugars. If you don't want to be a podge, you shouldn't have any either. Abigail, it's fine. Don't be polite. She's been acting inappropriately all day. Ooh, big word. You know, Dad used to call Abigail 'Night Light' because she's not too bright. It's nauseating watching an 11 -year-old behave like that. And then once she brought a note to get out of sport and she signed it 'Abigail's mother'. Oh, I remember that. That was a work of pure genius, Abs. Seven, eight and... Stop showing me the steps. Relax your upper body. That's still too stiff. I'm sorry. I can't do what you're asking. Hang on a second. What is with you today? You're like a robot out there. I know. I'm trying. To what? Prove a point? I cast you for a reason. We cannot just keep going over this. I said I'm trying. Hey, guys. Is there a problem? No. No problem. Right, Tara? Sorry about that. Going again. You're making a complete fool of yourself. I'm just trying to have a good holiday. Why do you have to be so annoying? OK, you know what? We're gonna meet you back at the Academy. I put a lot of time I don't have into planning this weekend. You've completely ruined it. Big deal. You've ruined my whole life. We can't go on holidays because Abigail has a concert. No chocolate ice-cream in the freezer because Abigail's on a diet. Like anyone needs chocolate ice-cream. Mum moved us to Sydney to be near you, and you never visit. I'm at the National Academy of Dance. I have classes every day. Well, why is it always about you? Because you're not special. You're just a little girl, overtired, overstimulated, and chock full of preservatives. Yeah, well just as long as I'm not like you! Paige? Paige! Excuse me, did you see where my sister went? Look, I know you're not actually a statue. Argh! Paige! Abigail? Paige has gone. I can't find her anywhere. - I turned around and she's gone. - OK. We're on our way to the Academy. I'm sure she'll go there. - Anything could happen. - I'll call you if we find her. - Don't worry. Paige is really smart. - Unlike me, you mean? Abigail! Again. Wait. Can I suggest something? Please. Look, Tara's an instinctive dancer, and you have the foundations of a good piece. You just need to stop micro-managing. So it's my fault? It doesn't always help to be dictatorial. Dictatorial? Tara, how are you feeling? - I could do with a break. - Right. Let's break. Dictatorial's a bit harsh. Maybe. Look, what you're doing is not working. That poor girl is dancing her heart out for you. Tara? She'll be fine. Besides, I'm sure it's always tense like this before a breakthrough. Did you hear anything I just said? I can't work out if it's confidence or arrogance you're throwing at me. What do you want it to be? I'm sorry? Confidence or arrogance? Maybe we should work it out over dinner. What? Well, I mean, there's obviously something between us... Dude, you're 17. 18. Which is why I'm going to overlook the fact that you're out of line and that I just gave up my Saturday to be your mentor. And I appreciate that. I really do. But I was... Mate, you have obviously got all of this figured out, so I'm gonna leave you to it. Is Sammy the best dancer at the school? Yes. In the world, actually. Thought so. Does he have a girlfriend? Look, shouldn't you be in Abigail's room? Do you want to roll first? No, I don't want to play. Oh, here she is. Paige, what are you doing here? Hey, Sammy. Wanna play? Paige, you can't just run off like that. Abigail is out there eating her own hair. No way. She's too worried about the fat count. Yeah, Paige. Look, you can't stay here. So we have to go. One game or I'm going nowhere. Alright, I'm going to call Abigail. Well, this is cosy. So sorry to interrupt. No, no, no. We just got here. Abigail? Paige... You and Kat plan that? Turn Abigail into a freaked-out, screaming mess? We didn't plan anything. Yes, you did. You know what? You did me a favour. Now I know you all hate me. Nobody hates you. Go barnacle yourself to Kat, Paige. Sammy really likes you and you treat him like dirt. Mum and Dad love you so much that we're all split between two cities. Paige, get out. Even I don't. Only YOU hate you. I usually hate weekends, but I was really looking forward to this one. I made it for you. Actual hug? Do you want me to start or should I just wait for Dana? Dana and I had artistic differences. Look, you don't seem to want to be here either, so I can get another dancer. Wow, has the brilliant Ethan Karamakov been rejected? That's gotta hurt. I never knew you were quite so sarcastic. When have you ever actually taken the time to get to know me? I don't understand. Why'd you pick me in the first place? It was when you were doing that dance with the ribbon. You were like... A kid? Yeah, I got it. No. You were inspiring. Look, go, stay. Do whatever you want to do. The best part about my sixth birthday party was when it rained, even though it ruined my new dress, even though it made the pony spook and bolt right into the cake. I remember farmers crying, the whole town celebrating, all of us playing in the mud, and my party became famous after that... as the one that broke the drought. It wasn't what I'd imagined. ♪ Wake up... ♪ It was better. ♪ It's me ♪ Wake up ♪ I can't sleep ♪ The sun's coming up. ♪ That was perfect. I knew you could do it.
