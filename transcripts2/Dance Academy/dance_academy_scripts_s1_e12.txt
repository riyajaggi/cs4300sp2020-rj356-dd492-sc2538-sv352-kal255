 Dance Academy (2010â€“2013): Season 1, Episode 12 - Pressure - full transcript 
 It's exam week in both dance and academics, keeping most everybody busy, especially Sam. As Tara nears her first kiss with Ethan, she fears taking on his expert lips without practice, so (at Kat's urging) makes Sammy her kissing-dummy. Meanwhile, ill-tempered Abigail demands that Sammy rehearses their pas-de-deux together every night. It's whom Sammy'd like to be kissing, but signs that Abigail's anorexic diet regimen is catching up with her alarm him.

 Previously on Dance Academy... Ever even kissed a guy? You haven't, have you? I'm trying to find every possible reason not to feel this way. My brother will break your heart. I need a dancer for my mid-year choreography assessment. Any chance you'd be interested? Yes. I mean, um, not uninterested. - Not until you tell us! - Tell you what? Who you've got a crush on. I'm not telling. It's Abigail! You can't be serious. Oh, she just drives me crazy.

 How can you not eat that now? It's called self-control. Try it. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru A blister. Excess repeated pressure in a concentrated area causes local heat to build up. The heat forces the separation in the top layer of skin, the epidermis. It's the kind of pressure that's everywhere at the Academy. First-year contemporary exam, we're ready for you now. Olympic swimmers train their whole lives for one race, and when it finally comes they can slip off the blocks or miss their tumble turn. No matter how hard they've worked, it can all fall apart in a moment. It's the same with dancing.

 When you're on stage there are no second chances, just your body and your will. Whether you pass or fail is entirely up to you. Oh, these people are sadists! Who organises academic exams the same week as dance exams? Multitasking meltdown. Right. I need your help with anatomy. What? My help? I don't have time to help, Kat. Got to get A-pluses in all subjects and I'm taking advanced physiology. Do you know how difficult that is? More to the point, since when do you care about anatomy? Well, Natasha rang, promising a mother-daughter holiday. My choice. All I have to do is scrape in some non-embarrassing exam marks. That's fantastic. I'm thinking central Australia. She'll hate it. Oi! Eugh. Hey, are we on for rehearsal later? Um, I don't think I can today, but maybe tomorrow. Whenever. Can't wait. What was that? Um, we're rehearsing for his choreography exam. No, no, no. My brother was just in flirt mode. It's Ethan. He's always in flirt mode. Just not with you. My point precisely. So come on. What gives, little one? Really? Why? I don't know. Something came over me. I just felt like it. Hang on, after discussing this obsession in nauseating detail... I wish we were being examined on it. He pashes you and you just forget to mention it? It wasn't a pash. It was an almost-pash. Hold on. I thought you were into Dana. Yeah, but I lost interest. And plus, it only happened after Dana rejected him, so I'm not gonna read anything into it. Since when? Since you guys always tell me that I blow things out of proportion. Yeah, but you never listen. Yeah, it's part of your charm. You know you're talking about Tara Webster, right? This is exam week, so I'm not going to do anything but focus on my exams. So do you reckon you'll go back there again? What do you think? So for some unknown reason, maybe I killed someone in a past life... Abigail, is that you? You're my partner in the pas de deux exam. They're obviously trying to challenge me, which is fine, but also completely unfair as it affects my scholarship chances. Exam stomach. Does that happen when you get nervous? No. We clearly have a lot of work to do. One-on-one? Awesome, awesome. I have physiology on Wednesdays, OK? But after that I'm all yours. I've booked the studio for every night this week. Right. So I'll just study instead of sleep, then. Tonight, 8:30. It's a date. It really isn't. Turn. You're twisting my arms too far back. It's the other leg. OK, ready? One, two, three. Right. Again. One, two, three. You right? Three. Wait, wait, wait. Again. Three. Morning, Miss Raine. Abigail, it's exam week. Shouldn't you be conserving energy? I don't think enough of us worry about cardio. Wonder if that's something the scholarship committee takes into account. I wonder. Do you know if my name's on the shortlist? It's just I've worked harder than anyone since day one. You have. There are other factors. Such as? Abigail, you're a smart dancer. You know there are certain limitations to your technique. I had them too. Others have more natural potential. We have to work to the best of our ability, which you've been doing. But you're saying it still might not be enough? Abigail, sometimes ballet can be as unfair as it is unforgiving. But in my experience, hard work can overcome most obstacles. Are you warm? 'Cause if you need more time, I don't mind waiting. I'm fine, thanks. OK, how about you run it the whole way through? I think I might've distracted you last time, sorry. No, that's SO fine. You know, it happens. What happens? People get caught up in the moment. No big deal. So I'm starting? Yeah. First position, yeah. - Hey, Kat. - Oh, come on, people. My blisters have blisters. What more do you want from me? Nothing. Oh, good. Well, you can stay, then. So how's everything going? How's Tara? I don't know. You just had rehearsals with her. Yeah, right. She didn't say anything about it? No. I don't know. I just... No. My friend is not a challenge for your pathetic male ego. You'll break her heart. Ethan, I'm heading out. Sorry, mate. I've got things to do here. Don't you dare. Hey, Christian, can I have a go? This idea was genius. It's so good to be out of that freak show. I feel like saying, "They're just exams, people. "We're not curing world hunger." Yet. No, seriously, it's like you and I are the only two people not acting like the world is going to explode. Everyone just needs to relax. Whoa. Yeah, they do. So when am I going to ollie? Well, you got to learn how to roll by yourself first. Back foot on the tail, bend my knees. See, I'm rolling. Alright, and if you need to turn, then... Um, Christian? Back foot on the ground. Christian. No, no. Back foot. Christian! There you are. Lose something? Um, yeah, just... just my bracelet. Oh, I'll help you look. You really don't have to. I'm not even sure I put it on this morning, so you really don't have to. You're looking for jewellery you're not sure you even put on? OK... I have this superstition thing about four-leaf clovers. I try to pick one before every exam. How'd you do that? I've never even seen one. It's like my one talent. I don't know. Apparently the leprechauns smile at me or something. Socks. Pardon? I don't change them during exam week. Superstition. Really? That's... Gross? Yeah, I know. You've got a bit of dirt on your nose. Oh. Here. Oh, um... You OK? I just remembered I have some stuff, you know, to do. So, um, I'll see you later. I've been looking for you. I hope you've been working on the lift. Feel this bicep. I'm a lift machine, baby. But are you sure you don't want to take the night off? You're looking kind of tense. You're telling me I look tense? Tense AND beautiful. Plus, realistically, there's only so much work you can do. If they gave me a real partner, I wouldn't have to work so hard. You know, misplaced anger is often a by-product of low blood sugar. When was the last time you ate something? My blood sugar is fine. My only problem is you! You know, sheep don't kiss. I want to know how humans decided that's what you do when you like someone. When you think about it, it's a weird sucking motion with unnatural tongue etiquette. Oh, I am going to be on struggle street tomorrow. Kat, I need to talk to you. OK. In private. Yeah, because I really want to be around for that. There was another 'almost' incident. I'll kill him. No, don't. I wanted him to kiss me, I think. OK, well, you know how I feel about it, but I'm not going to stand in your way. Good. That's good because... What if I said I needed your help? Never? Is that even possible? People expect you to be a bad kisser at 12. But by almost 16... No. You don't know you're going to be bad if you haven't done it before, just... less experienced. Oh, I'll suck. I'll get all up in my head, like in technique class, and then I'll probably bite him or something. Wow. OK, teeth away, for starters. We'll treat it like technique class, then... break down the movement. Meet your new pas de deux partner. His name is Sir Joshua, and I'm really not comfortable corrupting him. Shh. He's mad for it. Trust me. You came. You know, I want to do well too. I just don't think there's any point killing ourselves in the process. That's where you and I differ. Let's go from the start. No marking. - We got it. - Whoo! Awesome. We should do it again straightaway. Make sure it sticks. Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm fine. No, you're not fine. I'm just a bit dizzy, OK? It passes. What do you mean? Does this happen often? Abigail, this could be serious. Stop procrastinating. Let's just do it again. Seriously, when was the last time you ate something? I eat, OK? Not this week. I haven't even seen you drink water. I'm not interested in being bloated. Your body needs fuel, Abigail. OK, that's not even advanced physiology. You'd better see Doctor Wicks. No, what I need is to get through tomorrow's exams, and then after that I'll rest all holidays. No, this isn't right. They won't let me dance, and there's no way I'll win a scholarship. You have to promise me you won't tell anyone. OK. On one condition. Mum sent me these for luck. You look like you could use them. I thought you said I looked beautiful. And one, two, three, four, a little bit of tongue, and six... This isn't working. What? What's wrong? This isn't working. I don't know where to put my nose or how to breathe, and I've got fur in my mouth. OK, I get it. So Joshua's not giving you a lot back. Am I right? Oh, hey, guys. Is Abigail around? I swear I'm coming down with something. Mate, am I...? Do I feel clammy to you? So, how'd it go before with Tara? Yeah, good. Well, it didn't actually 'go', but it will. No way! I am surprised you could be so selfish, Samuel! It'd be like kissing my sister. You're an expert. We've seen you in action. I have been told I'm quite talented. I know. Yes, and one of your best friends is floundering here. She's right. I'm desperate. OK. Yeah, I'll do it. This is wrong. Oh, agreed. Very wrong. OK. Shuffle closer. Lean in. OK. I'm gonna go... - That way. - Yeah. I can't do this. Alright, should we have a rule like no tongues? No, 'cause then it's not a proper practice. You can do it. Just... On three, yeah? One... two... You ready? Last exam. So, you and Lieberman, hey? Nothing happened. As you may recall, I am the oldest kissing virgin in the world. That still hasn't changed. Training Bra, why do you make things so complicated? Are you kidding? It's a minefield. When you're kissing the right person, it's always simple. What? I'll see you in there. Look, there's nothing to talk about. I just kissed you. Yeah, I noticed. Sammy was a practice. I didn't want you to know that I'd never done it before and I wanted it to be right, and I wasn't sure whether I was ready. And now you're sure? Yep. So how am I doing? Out of 10... It's weird. I mean, I'm happy for them, I am, but, um... Still weird. Yeah. So, no pash rash. I think I have a boyfriend. Next pair. How're you feeling? Never better. Abigail, this isn't right. We need to tell someone. No. You promised, remember? Stop the music. Abigail, this isn't like you. Go back and start again, please, and this time, for your sake, put some life into it. Bees. What? I remember what happens when I get nervous. I hear bees. Abigail? Someone get the doctor. Abigail? Abigail? Abigail? Does anyone know what's wrong with her? Abigail?
