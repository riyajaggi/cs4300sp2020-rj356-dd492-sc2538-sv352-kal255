 Dance Academy (2010–2013): Season 1, Episode 16 - Free Falling - full transcript 
 Kat's parents buy off missing her birthday, so she decides to throw a massive party. She gets drunk worse than unsuspecting foreigner Petra and has to be rescued in the bedroom from slick Lucas by Christian. Tara misses it because her lack of confidence and fear of injuries during scholarship-conditional private tutoring makes the lesson take forever. But worst of all, Abigail discovers a secret to make Tara's life more uncomfortable.

 Previously on Dance Academy... Katrina! Please don't let us disturb you. This is Petra Hoffman, on exchange from the Berlin Ballet School... your new room-mate. Well, good, you're both cast. My gorgeous, sweet Juliet and difficult, brooding Romeo. Perfect. Careful! You were fine! I was about to fall flat on my face. When have I ever dropped you? I thought you were getting along. It's got nothing to do with that.

 Come on. And now! You guys should check this out. It turned out surprisingly well. It never happened. So, you two kissed and made up yet? Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru As dancers, we learn to be in control of our bodies down to the last millimetre because if even one finger is out of alignment... Tara! Tara! It all falls apart. So you practise the movements until they're perfect. You learn to control gravity, to control pain and refuse to let yourself get away with anything.

 But there's one thing that doesn't follow the rules, that you wish you could control but can't - your heart. I want to know right now who is responsible. No, it's too weird. I said, "Let there be cake!" Alright. What was that? I know. I throw like a girl. You do. OK, to my sister, sweet 16 and never been kissed. Hey. Oh. What is wrong with you people? I specifically asked for you to fulfil my one birthday wish... not for presents, but for my world to be seen through cream and sugar and all things cakey. - Petra, I am so glad I met you. - Oh, but of course. Hey, what did I miss? Oh, my gosh, your birthday. I sent you, like, 50 reminders about being here. I know. I'm sorry. I'm just totally... Spaced? It happens. So, what's the plan for tonight? Are we doing anything? Uh, negative. The parentals are home tomorrow and I've... made Natasha promise that she is gonna cook us all something edible. The woman can do 64 fouettés. Give her an oven, disaster happens. It's fantastic to watch. Ooh. Hello. We were just talking about you. You better be studying your recipes. Oh, I can't believe I did that. I don't know what's wrong with me. You've gotta be kidding me. I've seen that look before. Fine. Whatever. So Ma and Pa have extended the tour. Estonia needs them, apparently. Oh, Kat, I'm so... Don't be. They put a bunch of money into my account and said I can buy whatever I want. The thing is I don't want presents and there's an empty house, which means... Off-campus house party. - Tell your friends. Yeah, not too many of your friends. Oh, he has three in the known universe. Come on, Grandma. Just embrace the fact that tomorrow night, we are going to be putting on... Oh, it's 'we' now, is it? Yes. WE are going to be putting on the event of the year. Alright, but you're doing all the work 'cause I'm gonna be hanging out with Tara. Huh. Good luck with that. She hasn't had much time for a lot of people lately. Does she seem alright to you? I mean, she hasn't said anything about me? Yes, we discussed you in detail because the world revolves around you. Good. Everyone notice Petra's high retiré position... nice and controlled. And fouetté. Now, Tara. Not in your own time. You had this working last week. What's changed? That was a question. I think I'm nervous about falling. Then you need to trust your partner. Maybe she needs to trust herself first. And what is that supposed to mean? You want me to say? Uh, excuse me. If there's a problem here, it needs to be resolved outside the studio. One day, heaven forbid, you'll be professionals. Start acting like it. Look, you need to stop whatever it is you're doing. Really? Because I'm pretty sure you're the one who kissed me. That was an accident. What? Your lips just slipped, did they? Well, it didn't mean anything. Look, I don't... I just don't feel that way about you. Alright, then. Forget it. You're not even my type. Christian. Yeah? Don't say anything to anyone. Hey, I heard you're looking for a DJ for your party. I've scratched some pretty big events... uh, parties, my grandparents' 40th anniversary... I could give you mates rates. Or for free. Whatever. OK, but if you mess this up, my knee slips in the fouetté turns. Awesome. Uh-huh. You want me to come early and help get set up? That would be splendid. Ethan Karamakov, pros. So he still smells like Christmas even though up close, you realise that's just his soap. And what you didn't know before is that it's not enough for him to just hold your hand. He has to wrap his fingers around yours. And then, of course, he's smart and inspiring. Hey, your sister is gonna want to marry me. Welcome to the family. Kind to animals... How do you feel? Nothing. Wait? What was the question? I was just saying you look tired. Oh, yeah, it's pas de deux. I'm having trouble with the finger fouetté turns. Don't worry. You were born to fouetté. You've all been getting too comfortable dancing with the same partners. During your careers, you will have to perform with people you've just met, people you don't particularly like. Am I interrupting your social life, Katrina? Always. Back to the same place. Kat, you'll get in trouble. What? Who are you? Our mother? Five, six, seven, eight. Don't. Don't! I can't imagine why you think I want my time wasted on a Saturday. We were... we were just... Out! Go and injure yourself somewhere else. Get out! Oh! Uh, Petra and I are about to head over now and set up. I have a private this afternoon. I'll get there as soon as I can. Don't worry about it. Kat, have I done something wrong? It's been a full-on week. Yeah, it's been a full-on week for me too, just small issues like my parents ignoring my birthday, but... We should talk. Tonight. Yeah, tonight will be pretty busy. Oh, right. I'll just... I'll just do this class and... I'll just see you there. Fouettés en pointe. If you can't do them by yourself, how can you expect to do them with a partner? Miaow! Listen, you have an inner cat. Miaow! So the fridge has spawned jelly shots. Oh, relax. There's barely anything in them. Oh, um, I'll get it. Uh, it's Sammy's mum. Hello, here is Mrs Karamakov... ..'s housekeeper, Gerta. Yes, I'll be here all evening. Oh, yeah. It tastes funny. Maybe they need more time in the fridge. Yes. I honestly don't understand why everyone is so obsessed with this. Pas de deux? Parties. I mean, what are they, really? People acting cool and hooking up so on Monday they can talk about how cool they were and how they hooked up? You've never been to a party before, have you? Close friends of yours, Kat? Oh, you wouldn't want me being unpopular, now, would you? Sammy invited me. Awesome. So, where's Tara? She's gonna be a little bit late. To her best friend's party? That's gotta hurt. You have a gift. Tara, you're not on your spot. Get on your leg! You're not on your leg, Tara. I can't! You are perfectly capable of doing this. You're just second-guessing yourself. And neither of us are leaving here until you get it right. Hey, loner. Having fun? Not really in a festive mood, sorry. You? Definitely. This is a massive improvement on dinner with the parents. So I was told the birthday girl cut the cake without me. Oh, you shouldn't listen to such rumours. Come on, everyone's outside. Go. I'm bad company anyway. If my brother knew you brought this, he would burst a blood vessel. Is he always so uptight? Only now he's got a girlfriend. Do you know whose party this is? Some ballerina chick wanting a rent-a-crowd. I told you, it's not working. No, you told me you were afraid of falling. What will happen? I'll get hurt. Maybe, but you've got to get over that fear sometime. Tara, fouettés can only be controlled up to a point. After that, you've got to trust yourself, stop thinking and just turn... from here. Again. I don't think they're worried about technique. Yeah, well, they should be. They look ridiculous. It's called fun. You could try it sometime. Yeah? Well, if it's so much fun, then why are you just standing here? Ethan? Hey, Kat... Just a sec. The neighbours are threatening to call the cops. Watch it! Look how wasted she is. I've come to cut the cake. I like cake. Oh, lovely, but you might want to get cleaned up first. Art project. Pretend I'm not here. Yeah! Hey, guys. Want some? Yeah, and then later, you can inject my eyeballs with sugar. We're fine. How many of those have you had? Um, I'm making a rainbow, see? Oh, excellent. I've never tasted jelly like this before. Can you take a photo of us, Abigail? What? Oh, OK. Nice decor. Daisy the rabbit. I haven't seen you in ages. Hey, don't pass out on me yet, birthday girl. We've got to get you out of this cakey stuff. Oh, no, I'm shy. Oh, yeah, you're Little Miss Innocent. Stay still. Petra! Sammy. Sammy! Have you seen Kat? What? Have you seen Kat? No. Have you taken it yet? What? The photo. Yep. Great. Thanks. Hey, come on. You've gotta work with me. Can't we just talk? We've been talking for weeks. And you and I both know that's not why you brought me up to your bedroom. No, I should go back downstairs. I'm being a bad hostess. No, everyone's fine. It's your birthday. They want you to enjoy it, alright? No, I really... I want to go back downstairs. No, Lucas. I don't want to do this. Are you listening? Get off me! Hey! What's your problem? My friend wants you to leave. Whatever. Hey, you're here. I really need to talk to you. Want to go outside? Yeah. What are you doing drinking like that? Do you think it makes you look cool? No. Because it doesn't. It wrecks things. And that guy, did you even like him? Not really. I just... I wanted, for the first time, someone to like me. Something's been going on with me lately that's been messing with my head and I don't think it meant anything, but I've been unfair to you and... I think I know what it is. You do? Yeah, the fouettés, right? I mean, you said you were having trouble, so I figured you were scared of falling, so I got you... You got me a bird. Have some water. I'll go get Ethan. No, don't. He'll freak out. He's probably with Tara anyway. Because she's perfect. And he's perfect. And perfect people attract each other. I'm seriously not perfect. Don't worry. I'm not perfect either. Nope. I always thought you and I were the same. Seriously unperfect. You don't like it? It's perfect, but... Oh, couldn't have predicted that. My sister handballs all the work so she can be free to go in for the birthday pash. I did not need to see that. Yeah, I'm not a Lucas fan. She could do so much better. I think she is. Check it out. What...? I'm sorry, mate. I didn't mean it. What just happened? Did I miss something? I don't know. I'll call her. I'm so sorry. Bad night? I thought I told you to get lost. I don't make a habit of listening to ballet boys. I don't want to fight you, OK? That's a shame. Oi! Fight, fight, fight! Wow! Fight! A real fight! I don't feel so good. You think there was something in the jelly? Yes. Hey. Eugh. Fight, fight, fight! - The cops! - Let's bail! - Let's go, let's go. - Let's get out of here. Thanks, mate. I'm not your mate. Drinking, fighting. Do I need to remind you that this is the National Academy of Dance? I want to know right now who is responsible. That'd be me. Please. You were barely even there. Sir, it was my fault. You're such a hero! I was cleaning up vomit the entire night. Self-absorbed much?! - Enough! You were all at the party when the police arrived so you are all on detention until further notice. But... Back to class! Katrina, I'll see you separately. Back to your original partners. You joining us, Katrina? I would, but I'm on probation. These days, I'm sky-high one minute and nosediving the next and so far out of control I don't know which way is up anymore. Miss Raine was wrong. Sometimes you really should be afraid of falling. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru
