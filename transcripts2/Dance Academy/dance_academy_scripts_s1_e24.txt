 Dance Academy (2010–2013): Season 1, Episode 24 - Heatwave - full transcript 
 Sammy enjoys his first-ever close friendship with grateful roommate Christian, but a possible reconciliation with Tara worries him. While all Sidney suffers a heatwave, preparations for the annual public performance must go on. Patrick treats everyone to a pool-class before the auditions. Ethan's famous father, Sebastian Karamakov, comes to direct it. He tells Ethan he shouldn't have refused a professional contract but gives the boy a shot as his personal assistant.

 Previously on Dance Academy... Abigail, you could learn something by watching Tara. It was surprisingly good. Mum's trying to miss her plane. Dad would freak if she did. You think? Mum moved us to Sydney to be near you, and you never visit. I'm at the National Academy of Dance. I have classes every day. I don't know if you know, but my dad's a choreographer, which means that this whole thing, it's a lot more important than just the marks, yeah?

 There's other pressures. As soon as this room situation's cleaned up I'm gonna spend more time with the boys, doing guy stuff. We're gonna jump. Arrgh! Thanks for everything. No-one's really tried that hard for me before. Hey... Can we just stop for a second? It doesn't feel... right. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru I have this recurring dream where I'm about to take the biggest exam of my life. I open the booklet and realise I can't answer a single question. All this time I've been studying the wrong subject.

 It's like... I thought I was on track. I thought I knew what I was doing. But actually, I... I don't know anything at all. Christian's never gonna speak to me again. Why? What are we...? What are we doing? My shoes are melting. Look, if you can't keep up... - Hold this, yeah? - Yeah. Hoh! I did it! Do it again. I am Hendrix! You wish. Ah, bromance. Ain't it grand? Broken air-con should mean no classes. It should mean wearing deodorant. You can't call a band 'Free Beer'. But imagine the poster. You're in a good mood... again. Yeah, we're getting a band together. Wait. You know that means playing actual instruments, right? Auditions for the end-of-year production are tomorrow. I'm teaching these 'Nutcracker' variations once. I have a headache. Pay attention. As first-years you can expect to fill the corps de ballet. On rare occasions, we might decide you're ready for a solo role. Katrina, even though your father is directing 'The Nutcracker', it doesn't mean you are guaranteed anything. Really? Promise? Katrina... seeing as you missed that run-through, you can rehearse with the boys. And ready? And... Temps leve... glissade... cabriole. Miss Raine, there'll be a lot of paperwork if I die of heat exhaustion. Katrina, we are all hot, we are all uncomfortable, but we're here and we... Sorry about that. Oh... Sweat! Gross! Use the resistance of the water. It'll help you work the right muscles. Arabesque. Is this right, Patrick? Good, Tara. Rehab seems to have strengthened your technique. Hey, Mum. Seriously? Do I have to? I thought she had school. What?! I think Chris is getting us some drinks or something. You two are very chummy these days. Do I have cause for jealousy? Uh... maybe. We made a pact of brotherhood. Oh. So... no more girls, no more break-ups, no more jumping when one of you snaps your pretty little fingers. From now on, we are an Island of Men. Aww, you have a guyfriend, just like you've always wanted. Yeah, I have a mate. It's just annoying that if anyone in our year gets a solo, it's gonna be Abigail. Oh, my mum played Clara when she was in first year. I'd love to play Clara. Yep, and she never got over it. Insisted on dancing it until she was 30. I hate 'The Nutcracker'. I'd be Flower Number Six if they wanted me to. I'm just happy I can audition. So how's your knee? Is it alright? Yeah, it's alright. Gonna chuck us one of those drinks, bro? How could she do this to me? She knows auditions are tomorrow. Where's Sammy? He's busy. We all are. Sit down. But we will see him tonight. No, we won't. Why? Because. Because why? Because we broke up. What did you do? Excuse me? I'm not discussing this with you. It's so unfair. Everyone's breaking up. Everyone in the whole wide world. Mum and Dad are. Paige, that's not funny. They are, and it's all your fault. What went through my parents' minds when they made me do flute lessons? How is that a life skill? You could play bass. Girls dig bass. Not that that's a concern, right? Island of Men. Sorry. Hey, this summer you should come stay at my place. We can rehearse in the garage. Yeah, I could... I could teach you to surf. Sweet. Yeah, awesome. You think your parents would really go for it? I mean, this place gets a bit much over the holidays. I think they don't have a choice. Look, you're still 'golden boy', I am still 'child of concern'. That's not gonna change. Yeah, we'll see. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ciao. Gattino... Papa. Ahh. Mwah. Mwah. No wonder the company wanted to keep you, huh? You've been working out. A bit. And now it's all for nothing. We'll get to that. Um, so maybe you could take a look at my reel at some point. Course. You're one of my main reasons for being here. Oh, the thought of directing a student version of 'The Nutcracker' wasn't temptation enough? The thought of keeping an eye on you two was certainly appealing. There are some serious family discussions to be had. How many more ways can he say, "I'm disappointed?" Oh, well, welcome to my existence. You must have misunderstood. They fight on the phone and Dad hasn't been down to visit us for ages. Paige, that's not the same thing as breaking up. Push. Harder. Ouch! Careful! All you care about is ballet. What do you want me to do, Paige? Lock them up in a room and not let them out until they promise to stay together? No, Abigail. I want you to help. I have to live there and you don't do anything except make it worse. Meaning? I'm not the reason Mum moved down here. Dad's back home and he needs us... I didn't ask anyone to do that. Abigail, you HAVE to talk to them. No, I HAVE to rehearse. If they're splitting up because of me, may as well make it worthwhile. Play. The girl? Tara Webster. First year. That's my best friend, Dad. His muse, but my best friend. And you've sent this to companies overseas looking for choreography work? Yeah, I've been getting some positive responses. I'm not surprised. Your name alone would get you in through the front door. But the work here... doesn't stand up. Right, well, I'm approaching some pretty cutting-edge places, Dad. Your name wouldn't necessarily help me there these days. Maybe it's not the right time for this. I'm peckish, you're jet-lagged. You should've taken the company's offer. It would be years standing around in a corps doing other people's work when I'm ready to do my own. Look! A pirouette! You guys love pirouettes! At 18, you think you're ready to stand in front of a group of professional dancers and tell them what to do? I said no to the company, Dad, so if you haven't got anything else to add... Well, here's a proposition. Don't audition for 'The Nutcracker'. Come and work as my assistant. See if you can cut it in a professional environment. You know what? I think it's too hot to eat. Before I got to the Academy, I had this list of 'Whys?' "Why do I get anxious if I don't know where the nearest toilet is?" "Why do I have three hairs on my chest and 18 on my big toe?" "Why do I like taking those IQ tests on the Internet?" "Why have I never been this happy?" Great shot. Your break. Nuh. No way. I am hopeless. I thought... Oh, sorry, I thought we were playing. Yeah, but Training Bra here needs a lesson. Yeah. OK, uh, what do I do? Alright, hit the white ball. Try and get it in... Yeah, I'm done anyway, so I'll just leave you guys to it. Yeah. There you go. So they don't know you know? But you could come home and talk to them about it. Tell them how we feel. Hey, Mum. Yep. We're out the front. Paige is ready. Well, they said they're not giving solos to first-years but I'm doing everything I can to change that. Yeah. I know. Well, it's not like the competition stands a chance. OK. Can I sit, or will that be breaking the rules of brotherhood? Already broken. He's in there with Tara. You know, if they get back together, we are entitled to lodge an objection. How many times can they put us through that? So... you and Christian have been hanging out a lot lately. It'd be totally understandable if you'd developed, say... a crush. On who? Tara? Christian. Like... a man-crush, or whatever. I don't have a crush on Christian, Kat. Hey, I've had girl-crushes before. It doesn't have to mean anything. Come on. You are an evolved specimen, Samuel. We can talk about this. Can we change the subject? OK, so, I have a couple of casting suggestions that I wanna run past you and a few staging ideas as well. I think there are some pretty exciting places we can take this. Great. I need you to photocopy these schedules. Now would be a good time, Ethan. Um... sure. So... 'Nutcracker'. Are you ready to fight the mice? Dad, really, do you have to? I'll never forget it, that's all. Your mother was playing Clara, it was a battle scene, you were... Three, and I ran onstage to save her. You stopped the whole performance. You stole the show. And I knew right there and then that you were born to be on the stage too. See, that's why I'm not worried about you. I get it. You felt the need to push the boundaries this year, but I know that next year you'll be ready to work. I've been pushing the boundaries because I've been unhappy here, Dad. Then why haven't you left? Wasn't aware that I actually had a choice. Oh, come on, kitten, ever since you've been three years old you've done whatever you wanted to. I get that you wanna rebel against your parents, but you belong here. The sooner you start accepting that, the better. I am not one of your teachers. I'm not interested in school politics, what year you're in, or your attendances. I am a choreographer. I am looking for dancers. All that matters is how well you perform, and how... how focused you are... So incredibly sorry. And how professional you prove to be. Let's get started, shall we? You OK, Tara? Um... yeah. I'm fine. My knee's fine. Can you go on? You bet. From the manèges? - Great. So... - I reckon. It'd be really good. Your cue, Kat. Uh... sorry. Are you OK? Yeah, I think so. Everyone... Dad... Hey! How did you go? How do you think? So? Killed it. OK, this is bad. It's like I'm back in the exam room and suddenly I don't know anything. There's a whole list of 'Whys?' that have never even crossed my mind before. You OK? Yeah. They're now staring me in the face. Some of us are about to head to the pool. You gonna come? Yes. Yeah. The problem is, once I let these questions out, there's no going back. I was just standing there and I was really thinking, "Any moment now I am going to dance," and then suddenly my legs were walking me out of the studio. Like I had absolutely no control over what my body was doing... Christian's never gonna speak to me again. Why? Because you were right. Sammy, a man-crush isn't the end of the world. What if it's more than that? Mum... I got the Snowflake solo. I know. It's so technically demanding. Hey, listen... do you think I could come over tonight? Paige and I really need to talk to you about something. It's not like what I had with Abigail was nothing, OK? That was real. Yeah, of course. Things have just been so intense since the court sentencing. Yep. Sure. And when you're living with someone, in that close proximity, it's textbook that stuff gets... confused, you know? Uh-huh. Yes, yes. All of that too. And maybe you just like him, Sammy. Audition walkout? How could you not tell me? Um... it wasn't really planned. You OK? Mm. So far. I am the Mouse King. Mate, that's awesome. Cast list. Check yours. Soldier Number Two and... Boy at the Party. Oh, yay! What about you? Bah-bow. What? Nothing? I was late, I fell, I just wasn't good enough. Hey, can I grab you for a sec? Look, you don't have to explain. We can't say anything until the doctor signs off on your knee, so this has to stay inside the vault. You're dancing Clara. What? Hope you're ready for your life to change. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru
