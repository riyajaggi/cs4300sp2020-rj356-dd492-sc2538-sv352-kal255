 Dance Academy (2010–2013): Season 1, Episode 10 - Through the Looking Glass - full transcript 
 Christian is delighted by a surprise visit from big brother Aaron, although he won't even show knowing him at the academy. The reason is Aaron always got him into trouble, and this time needs Christian to provide a false alibi, which may compromise Christian's spot in the dorm and hence his parole. Couple exercise problems, especially with lifts, cause fear and trouble among some dance class partners, but switches aren't allowed, nor excuses. Aggravated with her looks, Abigail breaks Tara's special mirror.

 Previously on Dance Academy... "Proven commitment to training "for an elite career in dance "would be compelling evidence "that Christian would benefit from a non-custodial sentence." This could be your ticket to freedom. Oh! Oh, sorry. Want to know why I'm so mean to Tara? Because the three of you are idiots. Abigail, you do know that for your height and weight, you're in perfect proportion, don't you? It's normal to be developing. I'm not developing.

 And I'm certainly not MOST girls. I have these. I have bigger these! But I'm going to be a principal dancer. And principals don't. They just don't. They're ethereal, they're like... Who? Tara? Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru Out in the bush, the best way to survive is to blend in to your surroundings. Make it romantic. I once watched this lizard become exactly the same colour as the tree it was sitting on until it was almost impossible to see, which helps when there's a predator nearby.

 Yes. Tara, Christian, that's not as dreadful as I've seen it. But another time, it was too slow to change and as it stepped out into the open, that's when the predator swooped. Sorry, sorry, sorry! I said like a gazelle, not an elephant. Go to the back. I'm sick of the sight of you. Katrina, to the front of the class. Sometimes I think it'd be easier to survive in the bush than at the academy. Miss Raine, I just wanted to say that I see your point entirely. It's clear that I need a new partner. Is it? I've taught Sammy all I can. I need someone who's at my level. Abigail, the problem isn't just Sammy. He had to do all the work in the lift because you're a sack of potatoes. Me? Potatoes? A dancer who blames her partner isn't popular in her company. I suggest you assess your own shortcomings. Thank you. Five, six, seven and eight. And failli, assemblé. Legs together in the assemblé. Good. Make a picture in the air. And... That's it, Christian. Watch your placement. Good. Failli, assemblé. A friend of yours, Christian? Um, never seen him before. OK, keep going. Yeah, yeah, tonight. No, it's all sorted. I'm here right now. Well, I'm just looking at a really ugly chick, actually. Yeah, it's pretty unfortunate. You're right, mate. It must be hard going through life looking like that. Excuse me? You know, listening to other people's phone calls is creepy. Yeah? So is loitering. Are you lost? What? Don't you think I belong here? Depends. Are you man enough for tights? Actually, I've got a formal invitation. I'm visiting my brother. Yeah, who's that? Aaron! Cheddar! What are you doing here, man? Not much, dude. Visiting you, apparently. Although, you guys don't really look like brothers. Well, this guy is closer than a brother. Oh, well, Aaron... Cheddar, leaving you to your man-love. So what are you doing here? Gran kicked me out. She said she's had a gutful of me wasting my life. Heard you've been hanging out with the Longleys. Don't believe everything you hear. I thought you were smarter than that. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. So are you gonna let me sleep on the streets, or what? No, I can lend you a cardboard box. This was my grandmother's and you don't even bother telling me? That whiny voice is seriously unattractive, just so you know. I'll replace it tomorrow. You can't just replace it. It's all I have of hers. What do you want me to say? The ugly mirror's broken, which is tragic, yes, but also irreversible. So aside from me writing an apology in my own blood, all I can do is get you another one. Well, I suppose, but just so you know, you can't break something and then pretend it never happened. It's common courtesy... Shh! So let me get this straight. They're actually forcing you to wear girls' shoes? It's just temporary. And they're not exclusively girls' shoes. Oh, they SO are. Guys do pointe. Character roles. Like the ugly sisters in 'Cinderella'? - Yes. - No way, dude. What? Lucy Gladewright - dead ringer. No, she's not. This guy had the biggest crush on Lucy Gladewright. No, no, I didn't. He was 10 years old. He thought they were gonna get married. - Aww! - What?! Wait, are you... are you blushing? - Are you blushing? - Aww! Man, I love this guy! Are you gonna get me some food, then? Sure. Sweet. Why not? Uh, who's that? He's a mate of mine. He's gonna be staying here tonight. How'd you get permission? And who made you hall monitor? Do you want a badge or a sash? Yeah, a sash is cool. Ready? Bang! What's up? He is the funniest guy I know. Christian? Yeah. Dude, he doesn't speak. I've seen him smile about twice. And one of those was a grimace. Trust me, alright? Actually, there's a funny story. This one night, we got pulled over by the cops and he says, "Why are you speeding?" Christian leans over from the passenger seat and goes, "Oh, sorry, mate. "The servo we're about to rob closes in five minutes." The cop just laughed and let us off. Oh, no way. Yeah. Well, we were only going, like, five K's over. But the funny thing - same cop, half an hour later, picks us up for robbing the servo! That didn't happen. Yeah, why would you do that? Guys, come on. It's obvious that it's a joke. Right? Why do you think he's here in ballet school? He doesn't have a choice. Christian robbed a service station? Um, it's getting late, so... Yeah, no, we've got homework to do. What homework? Uh, anatomy homework. Let's go. Um... yeah. See ya. You hadn't told them? No kidding. I'm gonna get some air. Look, mate, you know I got a big mouth. It's always getting me into trouble. I didn't tell them for a reason, alright? I thought they were your friends. Why would they care? You don't get this place, OK? It's only temporary, right? Yeah, sure. Good, because once this whole court thing's over, I reckon we head straight to Indonesia. We've been talking about it long enough. Yeah, what if we go to jail, Aaron? Why so negative? A couple of months in ballet land, a quick hello to the judge and we're out of here. Bo's got a mate with a charter boat. Oh, Bo Longley's got a mate now, does he? Yeah, we can cruise the islands and surf all day, live the dream. Gotta actually do it, Cheds. Oh, what are you doing there, mate? You almost gave me a heart attack. Didn't know if you could get back in or not. Are you hurt? Yeah, stacked my board. So where is it? The board? Are you gonna get me some ice, or what? Sorry, sorry, sorry! I said like a gazelle, not an elephant. How many's that? 23, not including the partial rewind after 15. I'm sorry to interrupt your morning, Sammy, but I'm not too keen on splitting my head open because you lack upper body strength. So that means one of us has to deconstruct pas de deux since I'm wasting my lunch hour with Tara. You're spending lunch with Abigail? Long story. She owes me a mirror. Lost something? My camera. It had a lot of seagulls. Where'd you have it last? In here, last night. What? When you were talking to Christian's friend? What's that supposed to mean? The guy thinks it's funny to rob petrol stations. Of course he'd steal your stuff. I only told Abigail. Did I just hear that right? Christian's friend robbed a petrol station? Yeah, but he wouldn't steal from us, would he? Would he? Would he what? Your friend stole Kat's camera. No, it's missing. It could just be a coincidence. We're not saying he stole it. Don't hear you saying he didn't. Just get it back, yeah? Hey, girls, do you want a go? I hear dancers are pretty good on their feet. Hey! Here he is. Mate, do you always have this effect on women? Kat's missing her camera. Red one, apparently. Seen it? What? Are you asking or accusing? You tell me. Mate, you've really lost it, Cheds. These rich kids have done your head in. So where were you last night? Oh, well, you know, I snuck into Kat's room and I stole her little dinky camera. Where do you think I was? I don't know, Aaron. I don't need this. Abigail, we only have half an hour for lunch. Is this place close? Blackforest. I'd kill for a blackforest. 344 calories and 19.3 grams of fat. But that carrot cake, which people think is healthier, has 22.8 grams and 387 calories. Whoa, that's freakish. We're dancers. We have to know this stuff. Since when did you become encyclopedic about cake? It's not like you eat it. I have never seen you put so much as one morsel of cake in your mouth. It's comforting to know you're keeping tabs on my food intake. Well, it's not hard to keep tabs on a few celery sticks and some carrot. OK. How can you not eat that now? It's called self-control. Try it. It's ugly. Let me guess - you love it. It is from Europe, like me. It's also very old, like me. It's very beautiful, but out of our price range. Way out of our price range. You like antiques? My nanna did. She liked the way they had another life. Some mystery. Exactly. Did you see this? Look. Oh, Abigail, it's you! You evil girls! No... You distract me while your friend steals from my shop! No, we weren't! Oh, I don't think so! I can explain. Abigail! Explain to the police. But... It's not like we said Christian took it. Although to be fair, he hasn't exactly been honest with us. Kind of just makes you think that... We don't even really know him. Aaron's gone. He said he didn't take your camera, but I'll get you a new one. No, Christian, you don't... Ohh. Mr Lieberman, Mr Reed, you've misplaced your partners? No, they're coming. I think they're just... late. How observant. Shall we begin? Without partners? Mr Lieberman, meet Mr Reed. So, um, who's gonna be the girl? OK. Sweet. No answer. Class must have started. What is wrong with you? She's being completely unreasonable to hold us here. You were going to steal it. Probably you this morning too. No wonder you accused Aaron. I didn't take anything from Kat. No, just stuff you don't need from nice old ladies. She's calling the police. You don't know that. We could climb up there. We'd be able to hear her better. Any time, Lieberman. Looks like your boyfriend wants to drop you. Focus. Too heavy. You're going to buckle. Ready. One, two, three. Yeah! No. Turn around. OK. Arggh! It's in the timing, isn't it? You're not actually that much lighter than me. What can you see? She's on the phone. I knew that! Can you hear her? No. Tara, what's happening? Abigail, put me down. What? Abigail, put me down! I can't! She's looking! Abigail! Aristocratic chins. Don't rush. Don't rush! Firmly on the hip. Miss Raine. Christian Reed. Last night, 2:00am, corner of Alison and Belmore Roads in Randwick, there was an attempted smash-and-grab on a cash machine. What can you tell me about it? Nothing. I mean, I haven't left school all week. You can ask anyone. That's not what I'm asking, Christian. We've already charged one offender - Bo Longley, a known associate of Aaron Dean. Did you want to speak to him? Because he's not here anymore. He was here last night, though. He needed somewhere to crash, had a fight with his gran. You understand how serious this is? Yes. I should have asked if he could stay first. I'm sorry, sir. I don't get it. You have everything. No-one has everything. Do you want to get caught? Is it like a cry for help or something? Hardly. If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be here. This is so not my fault. We're stuck in a room, waiting for the police. I deserve an explanation. I think it's about the moment I get away with it. Like, I can slow down time and take the thing right out from under their noses. I'm in complete control. Powerful. The only other feeling that comes close... Dancing. Or at least it used to. So are you ever gonna eat that or is that a control thing too? Abigail? Excuse me! Hello! What are you doing? I'm getting us out of here. Excuse me! Looking good, Cheddar. School knows you stayed last night. They're not happy. I didn't mean to cause you any grief. How'd they find out? Don't worry. I told the cops you were here all night. Right. Thanks. So where were you? I got a call from the Longleys. Just at the last minute, I didn't even... So it was just luck that I was your alibi? Hey, hey, I swear I wasn't using you. It was great seeing you and all, but I should have known. There's always an angle. Don't be like that, Cheds. The whole reason I'm even here is because of you. "Come help me out on something. No-one will get hurt. "It's a service station, easy money." And now the cops are at my school. Hey, hey, it'll be sweet. Couple of months, this'll all be over. You don't know that. Trust me, alright? 'Cause that's really helped me in the past. So leave, ditch the lot of it. Indonesia's calling. No. Not this time. What? That's it? Yeah, I'm staying. You think they'll ever let you be one of 'em? A ballet boy? You can't change, mate. Nobody can. They won't let you. We have exams coming up and the pressure's just really intense. I lost my head. I've never done anything like this before. I'm just so ashamed. And you will never come back? Never. Never. Go. And the police? I only phoned directory assistance. But if you ever steal from my shop again, I will call them and they will deal with you. Thank you so much. That lizard I was telling you about comes from the bush, which looks beautiful, but is actually a pretty tough place, a bit like here. We can't change colour like the lizard, but we all have our own defence mechanisms. I'd give up. Just cut it off. Thanks for trying to fix it. Some of us build an armour so that no-one can get close. It's still ugly. And others grow thorns, hoping to scare the world away. But sometimes the best survival technique is just to accept that not everyone is your enemy. Found it wedged in the couch this morning. I'm a bad person. Yeah, that couch is like a black hole. So do you want to talk about petrol stations? Or Aaron? No. OK. But I'll have one of those rolls. Ugh, how do you eat that stuff? Arggh! Get them away from my food! Reckon if I smothered them in bacon fat, they'd let me stop wearing them? You could give them to me. Or leave them on the couch. Apparently it's a black hole. Yum. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru
