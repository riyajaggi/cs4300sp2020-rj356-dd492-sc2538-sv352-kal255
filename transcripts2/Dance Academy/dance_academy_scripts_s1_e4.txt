 Dance Academy (2010–2013): Season 1, Episode 4 - Minefield - full transcript 
 Instructor Patrick assigns the boy-girl dance partners lot-drawn confidence test games as preparation to the technical pas-de-deux course. Although meant to help them bond, they work mainly as truth time tests. Christian's talent impresses, but he intends to quit after his juvenile probation.

 Previously on Dance Academy... - You like him! - No, I don't. Practically every friend I've ever had has fallen for him. It's pathetic, right? When Mia went on exchange, we wrote up a pros-and-cons list and it helped clarify our feelings. So, Ethan Karamakov... Abigail - she emailed the pros-and-cons list to the whole school. Yeah. Look, I'm coming to stay for a while. No, I won't cause any trouble. It wouldn't be forever.

 Yeah. No, it's all good. Alright. 'Bye. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru Double battement frappé. Accent out and out. And petit battement. Everyone thinks a farm is a dangerous place. But not to me. Relevé. I know every rabbit hole, broken fence and rusty nail. And nice long necks. No matter where I am, I'm safe. Ribs in, Tara. And balance. And down and recover. Thank you, ladies. To the centre, everyone. Tara, you may join us.

 But the Academy is a whole other planet. One minute you think you know your way around. The next... Tara, plié. You realise you're in a minefield. Everywhere I look there's a new trap... "He smells like Christmas. "The way he eats. "The way he talks about things, real things." Another enemy... danger around every corner, and just when you think it's game over, the universe gives you a bonus life. First, everybody thinks I got my gear off in the boys' change rooms, and now this stupid list. Can it get any worse? Well, since you ask... At least I'm not the first negative on your list. I suppose I should be thankful. I'm really... I'm truly sorry, Kat. I never meant to drag you into my mess. And yet here I am, just some sort of obstacle on your way to Ethan. Trust me, I'm trying to find every possible reason not to feel this way. Here's a great reason. My brother WILL break your heart, and when he does, I'm not going to be there to supply the tissues. I promise I'm avoiding him. So you think Abigail sent it to third-years? He read it. Just kill me now. Right, pop quiz. Who can tell me the real meaning of 'pas de deux'? Pas de deux. It means 'dance of two'. Good. That's its literal translation. But what does it really mean beneath the French words, metaphorically? Pas de deux. Two bodies, one soul. A guy and a girl dancing together to produce one pure emotion. That's what today's class is all about. I've never danced with a boy before. It's true. Back home, girls danced with girls. There were no guys. Don't worry. First-year boys are just sweaty creatures that trample on your toes. There are three important ingredients in a pas de deux. Trust. Good. Pass it on. Good. Keep it going. Unity. Great. And, most important of all, communication. Without them, well... So, our star pas de deux couple from third year agreed to help out today. Ethan, Isabelle, good of you to join us. Now let's divide you into pairs. Can you go with Sean? Remember, to find unity, you need trust and communication. Are your hands always this clammy? I'm allergic to you. Focus on who you're dancing with. No-one else should matter. Do you want that in plaster? Relax. You're doing fine. "What a great class?!" I just meant Patrick's such a great teacher. Do you think it's a sign the universe is throwing us together? La-la-la-la-la. Before you leave, I've arranged with Miss Raine for you to have the rest of the day off from classes. Don't get too excited. Instead, you'll be doing an exercise for me. Same couples. One of you choose. And remember, you'll be marked on this exercise exactly as you would any other assessment. This totally blows! One blindfolded, the other a seeing-eye dog. Woof! Gross. Swap you. You could be tied to Abigail for 24 hours. Rather stab myself in the eye with a blunt spoon. It can't possibly be 24 hours, Clammy. Nobody else got that long. I did. 20 questions over 24 hours. That's it? "Ask anything you like of each other "but you must answer truthfully." Like I want to know anything about Christian. So you're not the only one. Sagittarian, favourite food - pizza, don't have a lucky number, and we're done. No, we're not. This exercise is important. Well, I know everything about you. It's kind of been broadcast around the whole school. Where are you going? The beach. I love this city. Man, check out that view. I'm going to go and find Christian. We'll be down here, checking out the babes. Excellent. Oh, I'm going to love this exercise. Are you some sort of stalker? Not always. You've got 19 questions left. So where'd you grow up? Malabar. One suburb down. By the beach? Lucky. Yeah, houso. Real lucky. 'Houso'? Housing commission. Where the poor people live. You think I'm rich? You're at the Academy, aren't you? So are you. Yeah. Well, it's different, and it won't be for long. Have you got brothers and sisters? I've got one brother. Are you close? He's in Broken Hill. I mean emotionally close. Well, he's flesh and blood. Why wouldn't we be close? What about your parents? What does your dad do? This and that. You have to answer. Says who? The rules. What does your dad do? Oh, right, the rules. OK. My turn. How far have you gone with a guy? The rules. How far? There's first base. There's second base. You even have bases your side of town? Ever even kissed a guy? You haven't, have you? Maybe I could help you out. Maybe you could get lost. Hey, I've still got more questions. Abigail! I'm trying to read. And I'm trying to strengthen my core. We could SO be doing this at the beach right now. I don't do beach. Why? Do you have an aversion to fresh air? I don't do sand, I don't do salt and I don't do sun. Great. I need my water. So do I. We'd hate you to die of thirst, now, wouldn't we? It's not like I'm interested. I'm only doing this for school. I don't care what his favourite colour is or what his family does. So did he tell you anything? - Ow! - It was him. "Oh, let's go to the beach to do the exercise. "It'll be so fun!" I didn't know he'd be here. Honest. Yeah, right. What are you doing here? Perks of being a third-year. Let me guess - Patrick's first-year trust-unity-communication exercise? You're not supposed to goof off. Thanks, Nana, we know that. Tara? Ball? You guys can play as well if you want. Don't look at me like that, Tara. How do you know... I might be blindfolded, but I'm not blind. Come on, it's just a game of soccer. Please? I am not the goal post, people! Come on. Whoo! OK, that's it. The target is leaving! Coming, Tara? Think I'm going to stay. Come on, Tara. Kick it. I haven't finished the assignment with Christian yet. Come on, we're out of here. You know, at some point in this scenario, toilets will come into play. You can hold on. No, not for 24 hours. I'm starving. Yeah, me too. - Swim, then food? - Yeah! I'll go and get... I'll get some food. It's closed for fumigation. Find another one. Why do boys' toilets stink so much? Why do you have to be so nasty? It's a fact. They stink. No, I'm talking about Tara's list, OK? Why did you broadcast it? I just think that's cruel and unnecessary. Less thinking and more doing before we both die of asphyxiation. Abigail, I can't... go... while you're listening, so do you think maybe you could whistle or sing or something, please? Hurry up. I still don't see what you got from spamming that list to everyone. You're like an annoying little insect buzzing around. It just made you look bad. Bzzz. Don't you want people... Fine. Fine. Bzzz! Bzzz! Look, won't say another word. There you go. Carbs after 3:00? I'd rather eat a deep-fried vending machine. Hey, where's Tara? Haven't seen her. Huh. Whoa! Hey, babe. Whoo. Come on. There's plenty of room on my lap. Come on. Hey! Come on, man. Watch my car. It's on, princess! Come on, we'll get them later. Do you have a death wish? Didn't you see what they were going to do to me? No, it doesn't matter. You don't pick fights around here. What are you still doing here, anyway? Well, if you must know, I'm waiting for the bus. Oh, what? No limo today? When have you ever seen me in a limo? You know nothing about me. Way more than I want to know. I've never met anybody so rude. Doesn't your mother teach you manners? She's dead. Look, just call her if you're worried. Who says I'm worried? I'm just checking messages. What would you know, anyway? I can see everything. This whole communication thing must be working. Yeah? Can you see this? Ow. I can't imagine what it'd be like to lose my mum. No, you can't. Did she dance? Yeah, when she was young. Is that why you're at the Academy? I promised my mum I'd audition. Doesn't mean I'm hanging around. You're going to quit? I'm not into it. I don't believe you. Suit yourself. I've seen you dance! Fine. You think you know me? True or false - I've got a brother. True. He's in Broken Hill. Very good. And let's say I got into some trouble. Say, something serious. Maybe I need his help. Do I call him? I don't know, probably. You said you guys were close. So you'd expect him to answer, right? Brother helping brother? Not till I call him from a landline. No call-ID to recognise, so he didn't know it was me. Well, you know everything. Is this true or false? I'd like to say it's false, but... See, you know nothing. I made it up. Me and my brother are tight-as. I've got one question left. Question 20. Hit me. Why'd you tell everyone about me in the boys' change rooms? You knew it was an accident. Now, why would I even bother? I can't believe you'd still lie about it. I know you did. You know, I wasn't the only one there. Ever thought about that? It says, "2-4 hours." Two, dash, four! Not 24! Tara, what do you think? Does that say...? Does that say '2-4' or '24'? Well, it's got a two AND a four in it. You want to know why I'm so mean to Tara? Because the three of you are a bunch of idiots. What's going on? How you doing? I need to talk to you. What's up? Like you don't know. You've been laughing at me this whole time, haven't you? Excuse me? Starting audition week... telling everybody about me in the boys' change rooms. That was you, wasn't it? Come on, you have to admit it's a funny story. And leaving me at the beach. Hilarious, right? What? But you weren't even with us. Not responding to my pros-and-cons list? I didn't realise it required a response. Of course it did. It's not fair. Because of you, the whole school is laughing at me. How is that because of me? Look, if you want to know the truth, I was embarrassed by it. I mean, I've spoken to you, what, three, four times? And then you go and write all that stuff and send it to everyone? I mean, come on. What are you talking about here? I don't even know you. Tara? Tara? She can't talk to you. Yes, she can. You said you were sick of girls coming to you after Ethan. Because I hate seeing my friends get hurt. Growing up, I had my mum and dad to give me the warning signs. Here we have to rely on each other... Prove to me yesterday's exercise wasn't a total waste of time. Trust that we won't let one another down, agree to disagree... Better. Nice work, class. And admit that, like it or not, for the next three years we're tied together with an unbreakable cord. So maybe we've got a bit of a way to go yet.
