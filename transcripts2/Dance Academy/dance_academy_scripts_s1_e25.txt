 Dance Academy (2010–2013): Season 1, Episode 25 - The Deep End - full transcript 
 Sammy is so annoyed by his feelings for Christian that he pretends his snob father refuses to accept Christian's summer stay-over. Christian finds out in stages, but only insists not to be dumped as friend and roommate by the only person who ever stuck with him so loyally. Ethan has a hard time as his dad's assistant choreographer, or is it as his glorified gopher? Tara's insecurity and whining cost her the Clara part in The Nutcracker, which understudy Abigail gladly accepts. Kat completely neglects dancing and accepts an Australian tour with rock singer/friend Myles Kelly.

 Previously on Dance Academy... I am a choreographer. I am looking for dancers. Come and work as my assistant. See if you can cut it in a professional environment. Guys, how you doin'? I'm Myles. It was brilliant! She's right. You were brilliant. You felt the need to push the boundaries this year. I've been pushing the boundaries because I've been unhappy here, Dad. You HAVE to talk to them. No, I HAVE to rehearse. If they're splitting up because of me,

 may as well make it worthwhile. Mum... Paige and I really need to talk to you about something. Christian's never gonna speak to me again. A man-crush isn't the end of the world. What if it's more than that? This has to stay in the vault. You're dancing Clara. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru 'The Nutcracker' is Clara's story. It's more than just a dancing role. You must take the audience on her adventure. Transport them into another world. Growing up on the farm, I didn't see the ocean until I was eight. As soon as we pulled up to the beach,

 I was out of the car and into the waves. I thought I knew everything, and didn't stop to listen to any warnings. Act II, 'Snowflakes' and 'Land of Sweets', studio two. Boys, battle scene, studio five. Dude, we're gonna be out there every day of the holidays. Sweet. Christian's gonna teach me how to surf, so... Oh, rock on. Katrina. Katrina! See me later. I have plans for you. It took about three minutes for the rip to drag me out to sea. I was in way over my head and I didn't even know it. Good start, Tara. Good start. Keep warm until the others get here. Abigail. You'll be understudying Clara. You should be very proud of your audition. It was technically very competent. Thank you. No, thank YOU. Who are you understudying? No-one. Ooh. Sorry. Just assumed they might've given you something. I got Clara. Well done. Oh, Ethan, nice of you to join us. My assistants usually arrive before the dancers. OK, starting with the Act II Snowflakes. Clara to the centre, please. Tara Webster? She's only a first-year. Congratulations. Don't hold back on the grand jeté. Ethan, could I have your expertise over here, please? Macchiato double-shot, easy on the foam. Snowflakes, first position, thank you. Soldiers, attack. OK, with music. Bring some energy to it, guys. Nice and sharp. Good. Keep going. Nice clean hits here, guys. Clean. OK, sharp turns. Finish. Remember this is just the illusion of fighting. You actually need to work together. OK, first positions. This time work as a team. Each one of these tutus needs to be washed and sequined. Oh, always happy to help you guys out. I was thinking, next production, that, uh, I might try set design. Productions are for students of the Academy. I doubt you'll be here for the next one. One rehearsal and I already feel like I'm... Drowning. There's just so much to get my head around. Mm. Sammy, wait up! Hey. How's life in the spotlight? I haven't made a total fool of myself yet. It's only lunch. Thanks. See you, guys. Hey, uh, my parole officer said that your parents need to sign these in order for me to stay over the holidays. My dad. Do you think he'll be cool? 'Cool' and 'Dr Lieberman' don't really fit in the same sentence, but... yeah, I'm sure he'll sign. Cool. So I'm sewing about a million sequins by hand onto tutus and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. For the first time in my life, I finally get a mate. He's a guy friend who I can hang out with. And then I... I get... I get these... Struggling for clarity right now. I'm trying to say 'feelings', but it's too weird. Right. Ugly word. Let's call them... 'muffins'. And I'm glad we're finally talking about this. OK, so, you know how I get these muffins when I'm around... Christian? Let's call him... 'Mouse Ears'. Right. Mouse Ears. You know, before I started getting these muffins, I... I thought I knew exactly who I was and now I can't stop thinking it means that I'm a... well... A... labrador? What? Friendly, cuddly, bouncy labrador? You're right. I'm SO glad we're talking about this. No, no, no. Come on. I just think you need to focus on your muffins for Mouse Ears, OK? Don't agonise over the labrador thing until it follows you home and asks you to keep it. Yeah, well, I have a better plan. Avoid Mouse Ears until the muffins go. Every last crumb. Homework? Sort of. 'Pros and cons'?! "Should I tell M.E. about the muffins?" Who's M.E.? No-one. "Cons. One - Probably hates labradors. "Two - I'll be thrown into the Harbour, or I'll jump. "Three - Jews can't join a monastery." Should I ask? Please don't. Hey, what did your dad say when you gave him the forms? Um, he... he hasn't signed them yet. He's been quite busy with work. But I'm on it, so... yeah. And you should probably tell M.E.... she might like muffins. I doubt it. I call and call and you never pick up. I've had rehearsals. I'm understudying Clara and I got the Snowflake solo. That's great, Abigail. Your mum rang. She told me what's happening at home. Having your parents separate is a pretty tough thing for anyone. Look, Adam, I'm not sitting on the couch right now, and this has nothing to do with eating, so I don't really see how this fits your job description. Sometimes when students see their parents making sacrifices for them to attend the Academy, they can blame themselves when things start to go wrong at home. Look, can we skip the psychobabble? Mum left Dad behind in Brisbane so that she could support my dancing. Now they're separating because of the distance. It all seems pretty cause-and-effect to me. We done? I've got rehearsals. Save me. I am drowning in a sea of tulle. Oh, well, hello, gorgeous. How's the weather down there? Myles! Hi, um... better than London, I guess, but I wouldn't know. I haven't been outside all day. Well, go outside and check it for me. Sure. If you wanna spend an international phone call talking about the weather. And, hey, then we can discuss phone connection. I have to go. There's someone at the door. Oh, should I be jealous? I dunno. He's pretty hot. OK, remember what we said. Maintain your focus, maintain your spot, and... They're expecting too much of me. Clara's onstage the whole time. I'm not ready. You wouldn't have been cast if you weren't ready, Tara. You've had a long day. Rest up for tomorrow. Can I steal you for a moment, Ethan? 'Assistant choreographer' is such a difficult concept to wrap your head around. Well, Tara was uncertain about some of the choreography. I have an extremely inexperienced dancer in one of my lead roles and you decide to give her unsupervised advice. I thought it would save time in rehearsals. You argued for Tara in the audition and I saw enough potential to give her a chance, but she's struggling. You need to remain professional. Is that understood? Yes, sir. OK. "The path to happiness begins with a dream." That's my problem. I don't remember my dreams. I do. That's it. OK. Alright. Go on. Fly to Darwin, hire a Kombi, drive around all... Drive? You're 16. It's a dream, OK? Just go with it. OK, so, drive around the whole of Australia, stopping at every single beach and camping out at every single music festival. That's nice. OK, what's yours say? Hm. "What's the difference between Myles Kelly and bubblegum?" "One's artificially flavoured disposable pop "and the other's just bubblegum." That's a bit cynical, isn't it? Everyone I respect thinks I'm a puppet. Just another manufactured pop star. And they're right. OK, so... cut the strings. Write something that's for you. Alright, boss. Stop! Stop! Sammy, you're meant to jump on Christian. Yeah, I... I thought it'd be, uh, more dramatic if we created distance between... Yeah, let's just stay with the director's choreography, OK? Yep. Yep. Alright, let's pick it up from the three-step turn. Stop the music. Prompt side, Tara. Prompt side. Again, please. Cue the music. What's my cue? That was it. Stop the music. You're still half a bar late, Tara. We don't have time for this. What's the problem? Um... I think I just lost my focus. We have to move on. Get the DVD and make sure you know it by next rehearsal. Pick it up at the Snowflakes coda, thank you. Is it just me or is this getting embarrassing? Cue the music! And... "Oh! I lost my focus!" "Wait! I missed my cue! "I can't... do... the steps. "Ethan! Help me!" You should've gotten Clara. Or you. Or Suni. We all know why she got it. It helps when the assistant choreographer's wrapped around your little finger and you're not afraid to ex... Sorry, but this is a professional production and thanks to one person it's gonna look like a primary school Christmas concert. Abigail... you were well cast as a Snowflake, but Clara's about heart and you can't fake that. So you'd better hope that Tara plays that role, 'cause if it's you up there, the audience will see how empty you really are. I can see you. You're not invisible. Oh! Hey! You're avoiding me. No, I'm not. Look, I get why. It's fine. Look... Your dad won't sign the forms. They're respectable people. They shouldn't have to look after a convicted criminal. Yeah, look... Mate, I'm really sorry. It's not your fault. You tried. Huh? Lucky you got this far. YOU'RE lucky! I let Mouse Ears think my dad didn't sign the forms because my muffins are out of control and I'm afraid it means I'm a labrador. OK, that is low. You're making Christian believe that he's not good enough for your family?! Sammy... I just... I need some space, OK? I just need some time away from him to get my head back to normal. So you're gonna let your best mate rot in the boarding house all summer because you can't talk about your feelings? What do you want me to do, Kat? Should I get a T-shirt that says, "Samuel Lieberman... gay-boy. "Have you seen my room-mate?" You said the 'G' word. Well, I can't pretend it's just a 'man-crush' anymore. I think it's a little bit too early to be worrying about whether you are or you aren't. What you do need to worry about is the problem at hand. Christian. He has done nothing wrong and you can't make him think that he has. Phew... Hey. Do you think I'm empty? Never. Why'd you break up with me? I'm fine with it. I'm just curious. I... I guess it just... stopped feeling right. Sorry. It's family stuff, not dancing. I'm sorry. What? Sorry, I have to, um... That's your dad's signature. I can explain. Don't bother. Christian, I just... feel we need to take a break. You know, we've been living in each other's pockets all year. And yet I'm not good enough to live in your house? That's not what it is. OK. What is it? I'm getting these... muffins. Is it OK if I use code words? 'Cause it's kind of hard to say. I'm afraid they mean that... I'm a labrador, and you're Mouse Ears. I think I like you. No, that's... That's not true. I know I like you. Not good enough, Tara. I need more extension. More height. You're carrying the ballet at this point. Stop the music. Stop. We're gonna keep going till you get this right, Tara. From the start, please. My knee hurts a little bit. How badly? I think I twisted it on the last pas de chat. Maybe you're right. Maybe you're not quite ready yet. Abigail, you take over Tara's part for this rehearsal, please. I know your knee's fine. Tell him you can do it. From the beginning of Clara's solo. Places, please. Good, Abigail. Uh, Darwin? The van, a map and no return date. You're right... I need to write some songs that I can be proud of and I just need to work out what I wanna say. Yeah, but you totally stole my dream. Well, I was kind of hoping to share it. See, that's yours. Come with me. I... I can't. Why not? Just think about it. Just make sure you ask your folks first 'cause I don't want them hunting me down. Road trip. Mm-hm. Every single beach. Every music festival. Just you and me. What is wrong with you? I don't know. I didn't mean for it to happen. It just... came from nowhere. Who do you think I am? Why didn't you trust me? Sammy, I robbed a servo. That is something to be ashamed of every day. This... how you're feeling... isn't. It's not whether I am or I'm not. It's... about you. If we're friends, I can't... I don't even know how to be around you. So... I should move out... and next year... You know, everyone in my life has either left me or kicked me out. Now you're trying to do the same. I mean, what do you want me to say, Sammy? What do you want me to do? I don't know! You're not ditching me because you're confused. Alright? OK. The thing about being out of your depth is that there's a really good chance you're just going to sink. How's the knee? You shouldn't have fought for me in audition week. Yeah, I should've. But if you reach up your hand, someone might be there to help you keep your head above water. You kept it! Got used to having it around. You're the right dancer for Clara. You have to fight for it.
