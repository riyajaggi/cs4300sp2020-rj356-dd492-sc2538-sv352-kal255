 Dance Academy (2010–2013): Season 1, Episode 9 - Heartbeat - full transcript 
 Due to Sammy posting some dormitory playfulness on the Internet, R&B; star Myles Kelly - idolized by most of the kids - picks for his next video the haughtily uninterested Kat. She only accepts if he'll consider modernizing costumes and choreography. Her suggestions works out so well, he makes her an offer to think over. Meanwhile, Christian winds up with Ethan constantly trying to outdo him.

 Previously on Dance Academy... I would love an excuse like that to get out of class. Katrina, your hair is a mess. Ethan, I want to introduce Christian. He's just joined us. A guy who needs a little space. My wallet. There's some cash missing. I can give it back. I don't want your money. But you owe me. I'm doing this piece for the showcase tomorrow, a bit of hip-hop. You up for it? Oh, yeah, I just do class work.

 I don't do extra. I could have told Kennedy about the wallet. You owe me. Ethan! Tweak, just let it go. Come on, let's go. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru I have this theory that for every song, there is one perfect listener. Hey, that's my idol you're messing with. That's your idol? Yeah. Move. And when you hear yours, it reels in all the jumbled threads of your life, tying them up into three perfect minutes... ♪ Baby, I'm gonna blow my cool... ♪

 your theme song for that moment in time. ♪ Every little inch of you ♪ You move it, you shake it You use it like some other kind ♪ Want somebody, want somebody... ♪ ♪ Abigail, ooh! ♪ You people are so lame. Then, for a day or a week or a month, the song's either playing on your headphones or it's in your head... the theme song of your life for that moment in time. ♪ Want somebody... ♪ Abigail, here we go. ♪ This is gonna take a while ♪ She won't let me make her smile ♪ Wanna give her everything, everything ♪ That's what you do to me, girl ♪ This is gonna take a while ♪ I guess she knows she can drive me wild ♪ Wanna give her everything, everything ♪ That's what you do to me, girl ♪ I, I, I... ♪ I... I'm feeling... ♪ Alright, got it, got it. Yes, got it! Yeah! Got it! How's it going? Sorry. You nearly had me. I wasn't even trying. Yeah, no, me neither. What are we up to? 57. That's right. You just rest there. Doing alright? Yeah, yep. You know the trick to push-ups? You have to pace yourself, man. That's a shame. It's official! Oh, whoa. Whoa, that's a lot of hits! That's a lot of weirdos. Huh, who knew Myles Kelly had so many fans? Hey, I'm a fan. Uh, yes. I rest my case. That's cool. Mm-hm, mm-hm. I'm serious! They're old people that don't dye their hair blue. Katrina. Mr Kennedy. Talk to me about your online presence. I'm not sure what you mean, sir. Tell me that you're not posting videos of yourself online. No, I... My office, after class. OK, sir. Hi, Mr Kennedy! There are academy guidelines about posting personal information on the internet. It's not like it was my phone number. It won't happen again. Sit. I've been contacted by some people at NAF Music. They handle an artist named Myles Kelly. They want you for a small cameo role in his new video. Myles Kelly? I wouldn't allow this for every student, but in your case, I think it could be a positive experience. So they want me to dance? It's paid work, after class. You have heard of this Myles Kelly? Um... yeah. Hey. Scrambled eggs for lunch, huh? Interesting choice. You reckon? Well, I always go poached if I'm after protein. I mean, scrambled's like, what's in there? Who knows? You can hide anything in scrambled. Wow, you've really thought this through, haven't you? Well, I like to know what I'm putting into my body. That's good for you. You don't? What? Think about that sort of stuff? Oh, constantly. No wonder I thrashed you in the last hundred metres. Well, you didn't. Any time you want a rematch... Hey, this is it, guys - ground zero of cool. Yep, it's a building. And seriously, guys, I'm cool from here, yeah? Oh, come on. We're excited, you're excited. Mm, I'm wild. Can't you tell? Hey, mate. I'm Sammy. This is Kat. She's here for the appearance. OK. Yeah, no, she's dancing in the video, this girl. She's dancing. Mm, waiting around backstage. I'm having a childhood flashback. You say it like it wasn't awesome. Kim, is it? Uh, Kat. I'm Tristanne. Hi. You'll be a small video insert within the clip... basically what you do in your online thingy. OK. Is MK here? He'll be out later. Why don't you and your friends chill, eat some sushi and stay out of the way until we need you? We're cool? Why does every R'n'B film clip look the same? We've seen this one before it's even started filming. The moves are cheesy, the costumes are cheesy. I bet the song is cheesy. Guys. How you doing? - I'm Myles. - Myles. Hi. How you doing? You must be Kat. Yeah. Hey, I liked your stuff. Really? Yeah. So you wanna come have a chat about the clip? Um, yeah, alright. OK, cool. No, no, no, not us. So, um, brie, fetta or camembert? Uh, sorry, I didn't mean for you to hear that. Too late to backtrack now. So if you think I'm so cheesy, what's up with the tribute vid? Oh, that. See my friends? Yeah. They're fans. And you're not? I'm just not great with the whole commercial thing. OK, so you're into songs that mean something. Something like that. Anyway, you know, this clip is gonna be a lot of fun. We've got great dancers, great choreography... Yeah, uh-huh. Alright, you've already hurt my feelings. Tell me what you really think. Honestly? Honestly. You don't think it's a bit predictable? Which bit? Well, the chory is like, "Yeah, whatever, seen it before." And the costumes... I mean, come on. Show me a self-respecting girl that would wear that. Alright, let's just slow down on the honesty part, alright? It's... You know, this whole thing, it's not really my call. I've got to trust these people - the director, the choreographer. Except it's your name on it. But what do I know? You're paying me, so I'm gonna shut up now. Your costume. MK, phoner with Beats FM. Yep, cheers. How you doing, buddy? Myles Kelly. We're cool? Uh-huh. Oh, hey, excuse me. I'm looking for Patrick's office. I'm guessing that this is not the front entrance. Oh, no, it's not. I am so late. Well, I guess I could take you there. Great. Dana Strong. Ethan Karamakov. Hi. I loved 'Symbiosis'. The intensity just blew me away. Wow. Thank you. Yeah, Ethan here works in our kitchens. Don't ya? Oh, I see. Ethan, come on. We're busy. 'Tangents' would be an awesome project to be a part of. Oh, so you're auditioning? Yeah, definitely. What about you? You gonna audition? Christian? He's here on exchange from a special-needs school. He's got coordination deficit disorder. Uh, saucepans to get back to? Yeah. Dana, this way. I'm gonna be fine from here, thanks, boys. You're hyperventilating. You have no idea. Doing 'Tangents' would be like a masterclass in contemporary choreography. Alright, um, who talks like that? And you want to spend your holiday taking class? Correction - I'm gonna spend my holiday performing with Dana Strong. That audition? Nailed. Sir. Christian. Hi. Yeah, look, um, what happens to me on the holidays? Well, in line with your bail conditions, you'll be staying here. There'll be a couple of international students sticking around on campus. What's on your mind? Nothing. That's a weird angle. What do you call that one? Oh, that's THIS one. Really? You think? Guys, guys, you've gotta leave. Up, up, up. You know, we're dancers too. You might want a dancer's perspective on blocking the scene. - Hey, guys. - We're being thrown out. Really? Can I come too? - Let's go. - Kat! What are you doing? Sorry, it's just really not my thing. Yeah, look, I really need your help with something. Can you stick around? Please? Oh, yeah, stay. Please. OK. Thank you, thank you. Come on. So you want to change the choreography? Yeah, I guess I've just seen this stuff a million times before. I wanna get the girls out of the booty shorts, put them in hoodies. And, you know, the moves? I want to try some new stuff. Well, it's your video. Yeah, it is. Ha! Five, six, seven, eight. Boom, ka, boom, boom, ka. One and two and three and four and five, six, seven, eight. It's perfect. We're cool? Yeah, we're cool. OK, guys, shooting first thing tomorrow. No black eyes, broken legs or whiny phone calls from your mother. So, Kat, got any plans for dinner? Are you asking me out? Maybe. What's your favourite restaurant? Mm, Tour d'Argent. Right, I'll book a table. Mm-hm, it's hard to get into. Trust me. Plus, it's in Paris. And you call ME pretentious?! Right, I'll take you out anywhere you want, just anywhere geographically possible. OK. - Hey, kids! - Hey. You're late. I know. Sorry. But we brought Crispy Crust provisions. - Who's winning? - Let's see 'em. Oh, my gosh. That'd be me! Hey, Sammy. Hey, Myles. Hi, Myles. Sorry, they're not normally like that. Your friends, they're great. Don't worry about it. They're, like, obsessed with you. Doesn't the whole fame thing do your head in? Not really. You know, I love singing, so if I get to do that for a living, who am I to complain, hm? I'd hate it. I'd run and hide. It's like ballet for you, right? You love ballet, so... Whoa, no, no. I don't love ballet. We're on speaking terms most days. Alright. So, um, are all your relationships that complicated? Uh, I think I'll pass on that one. Because, uh... they don't have to be. Hi. Hey. Hi. How you going? OK, everyone, find some space, spread out. Hi. How you going? And let's get underway. You're gonna be great. Oh, I need to pee. Again. Don't worry. I always get nervous before a big show. This is not nervous. I don't do nervous. Are you sure? Mm-hm. Maybe it's never been important to you before. What? Think about it. It's your own moves. It's a little bit different when it's your own creativity on the line, hm? Just wait till someone makes fun of it on the internet. OK, and five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And roll. Up. Good. That's nice. And really dive into that roll. Up. That's lovely. OK, can I see Abigail, Christian, Ethan, Morgan and Robbie? Everyone else, thank you very much. Great. The rest of you, come out into the centre. Let's rehearse the beginning again. First positions. Playback. ♪ Hey, girl ♪ Such a pretty face... ♪ Thanks. We'll go for a take. Final checks. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. Good. And playback. That was beautiful, but it's not quite what I'm looking for today. But thank you for all your hard work. It was great. Now I have some questions for you two boys, alone. Ethan, you're first. Christian, if you could wait outside for me. That's a wrap, guys. Thanks, everyone, for a great day. Cool. Whoo! That was fun! It was brilliant! She's right. You were brilliant. I reckon you should come on tour. Yeah, right. I'm being serious. Make a surprise career move. Look, I know it's not your thing, but, you know, it'd be different with you. We'd make it better with you. Myles, you've got that prerecord. Alright, cool. Look, I'll be back, but think about it. Things don't have to be complicated. You're going on tour with Myles Kelly. No, he didn't mean it. He so did, Kat. You're going on tour and staying in hotel rooms and celebrities and room service... And following Myles Kelly around. Yeah. You know, all my life, Mum has dragged me around to these amazing places where I've met these incredible people and it's great, T, but it's never MY thing. It was always about her. So why do you want this? Because it's my passion, my absolute passion. What do you... what do you mean? OK, where do you see yourself in five years? New York. Up there with the best, as a dancer, but also a choreographer. Um... Come on, take a shot. I don't know. I mean, can't I just dance? I've seen you dance. I know what you can do. So...? So, Christian, there is a place up for grabs right now and if you want that place, it's yours. What do you mean, I got it? I won? Mm-hm. You're green, and I think that's interesting. But you have to talk to me first. I want to know who you are and what you are, where you want to go. So talk to me. I didn't come here to do therapy. That's your answer? Yeah. Yeah, I'm done. But thanks anyway. Hey, Kat! Are you leaving? Yeah. You've got your interview, so... You know I was serious about what I was saying before? Yeah, I know. And today, yesterday... it was amazing. But... But...? But it's your thing. Myles? Are we cool? Yeah, um, just two minutes. I Ikind of have to go anyway, do my own stuff. And there's nothing I can say? Don't. Please. Myles? I don't know how many opportunities come along which can change your life. Myles. Or how you walk away from them when you realise they don't quite fit... so that you keep searching, always believing that your very own perfect song is out there... even if it hasn't been written yet. Whatever you do, don't go anywhere. I'm on the set of Myles Kelly's brand-new video clip. He is supercute and I'll be chatting to him next. So I got the call today. Dana's invited me to do the workshop. Nice one. Hey, you were pretty good. Thanks. Just not quite good enough. Ooh, it's coming, it's coming. Kat! Hey, everyone. Welcome back to the show. And today I'm joined by Myles Kelly. How you doing? I'm very good, thanks. Good. Now, your song, 'Hey, Girl'... Isn't... isn't that the pizza guy? Oh, well, no, not really. But I've met someone recently so I guess you could kind of say it's her song now. Wow. I'm totally gonna pretend that it's my song right now, but could you please introduce it? Because we are gonna play it. Of course. This is my new song, 'Hey, Girl', by me, Myles Kelly. And, Kat, if you're watching, this one's for you. Ohh! ♪ Hey, girl ♪ Such a pretty face Too pretty for this world ♪ Alright Always adore ♪ Beauty is skin deep It's such a shame ♪ Alright, ooh ♪ Pick it up, oh, baby ♪ Pick it up, yeah ♪ Pick it up, oh, baby Pick it up... ♪ When did you do that? Oh, glad to know you pay attention. Actually, it's quite cool. ♪ Hot enough ♪ You've got me dancing, dancing all night long ♪ You've got me feeling the beat Let's push it on ♪ You've got me dancing, dancing all night long ♪ You've got me dancing ♪ You've got me dancing, dancing all night long ♪ You've got me feeling the beat Let's push it on ♪ You've got me dancing, dancing all night long ♪ You got me dancing. ♪ Rock star! Yes, yes! Oh, guys! Mwah! That was cool. That was awesome. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells Exclusive for http://UKsubtitles.ru
