 When Anwar loses The Providence in a bet to merchant Abdul-Fahim, Sinbad confides about the curse- he will die unless they get the ship back. The gang follows Abdul-Fahim to a gaming-house and Sinbad wins back the ship. But the twisted gaming-house owners, twins Faris and Essam, challenge Sinbad to free his friends from a series of enchanted rooms before his curse kills him.

 Come on! Gunnar, I need more speed! Quick now, get me more speed! Faster! Are they attacking? No. Then what are you racing for? They started it. Sinbad! Come on, Gunnar! We need more wind in the sails! That's it, that's it!

 Come on! You are such boys! Faster! We've got him! Here we go! Hold on to something! I don't understand why you can't be responsible just for once in your life. I don't know why you can't enjoy yourself. Woo! Yeah! Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.Com Fresh water, food, get the ship prepared and then we head to Buruke. There's nothing here. We're all starving. Sinbad!

 Lend me the power of sight. You think he's in the mood for sharing? Let's just try to be polite. Little fox cannot change her nature; Lives to steal, lives to run alone. So the boy racers are also beggars? We're not beggars. We are willing to trade with you. It's two weeks time until we reach the coast of Buruke. Anything you can spare, food, fresh water, especially food. You're not beggars yet you grovel for scraps at my table. I have no interest in trade. Please. We're desperate. Hmm. Your desperation is rather appetizing and you clearly enjoy taking risks. Are you willing to wager for what you need? You want to make a bet with us? This is absurd. So, two weeks until you make the next port. Without food or water, some of you may not survive. I have enough supplies to see you safe across supplies to see you safe across the ocean. How much are you willing to how much are you willing to stake for your lives? Something so easily given has no value. Wager something dear to you, something you cannot bear you, something you cannot bear to lose, then I'll play. Why are we playing this man's twisted game? Because we're hungry. Just find anything of value that you can and take it to his camp. Where's my jewellery? Rina! She's gone, taken everything. I'm sorry. We can't play your game. How disappointing. We have nothing we can wager, nothing of value. What about your ship? Fine vessel, beat me fair and square. I think she would raise the stakes quite considerably. It's not possible. If you sail from here empty- handed, you'll be sailing to your deaths. I'm offering salvation. Yeah, but if we lose... Take a seat. Have a drink. Even if you lose, I will give Fresh water, mules, enough to see you through the desert to Buruke. Thank you. You're the smart one. I think you know this gamble is worth taking. Let me ask the others. Your companions are not as shrewd. Risk and reward, my friend. The flip of a coin? He's done what? Where is he? Anwar! Anwar! What the hell were you thinking? You have no right! That ship is our only hope. I was trying to save our lives. By gambling it away? I'm sorry. Great. You have no idea what you've done. Thank you, genius. He really is. Well done, Anwar. I'm sorry. I thought I was saving our lives. I can't do this, Anwar. What do you mean? I mean I'll never make it past the sunrise. You see this? The amulet is cursed. If I stay on land for more than one cycle of the sun, then I'll die. I'm not joking, I'm serious. What? Curses don't exist. Just like spirits made only from saltwater don't exist. Anwar, if I'm not back on that ship by sunrise, I'll kiss goodbye to this life. Look, don't tell the others, but without that ship, I'm dead. Where's your master? The palace of games, along the Mountain path. Get off me. The palace of games? She said it was some kind of gaming house. We're leaving. We have to go after him. Yeah, we have to win the boat back. You only have until daybreak. If I can beat him at the boat race, I can beat him at the gaming tables. A lot can happen in a day. What are they? Come on. You have news? I had a vision of him. Sinbad? If you're lying... Witness. Sinbad! Sinbad! Did you see him? No. I'm looking for someone. He's a merchant. His name's Abdul-fahim. Have you seen him? Not pretty. And not prosperous. Out! What happened? The palace of games, I saw it. And? I'm sure he's in there. I can win the Providence back, but apparently there's a dress code. A strict dress code. Faris kareem. My brother, essam. Welcome to our home. Please enjoy the room. Deny yourself nothing. - For the man who has everything... - Risk is the only true thrill. Let me see what they've got in their galley. Yes. Kaffir lime. This ship now belongs to Abdul-fahim. You shouldn't be here. The scent of kokum is on your fingers. Kaffir lime is what you need to cut through the sweetness. Sinbad, look. We've got him. Come on. 500 dinar if you wish to enter our most illustrations gaming room. People come from all over persia to play. Be advised. Once you step inside that room, there's no house limit. Those who hesitate definitely can't afford the stakes. We need to get into that room. Why do we linger? We're strong enough to cross a desert. No. No, we have to get the Providence back. Look, we need to come up with a plan. 10-1. 10. Take it. This will raise the stakes in no time. This must be worth 60 dinar at least. What? Let's be cautious. Try our luck at several games. This came from a man who lost our entire ship in one wager. One and four. The house wins. New bets please. All that money on a single row. I know. How will you raise your stake now? Extreme provocation. We meet again, the cheat who play with crooked dice. Get rid of him. Or we play a game instead? If you win, you can punish me double. And if I lose? I can play at any table, one game. This is meant to be the ultimate gaming house, how can you refuse? Face of the goddess, you have the freedom of the gaming house. Face of the demon and you'll be flogged. Here we go again. We can't lose every time. Statistically our chances. haven't been any better. Yes! Laka's found a new lover it seems. You may play at any table you wish. One game. Let us up there. As you wish. What are you doing here, dressed like that? Lady samarra, you know these people? Lady who? No. No, I don't know them. Lady samarra, I swear we've met before. Oh no, actually, I'm mistaken. You just remind me of an old friend we used to have. Same colouring perhaps. But now I see she had none of your elegance and style. She was a scrawny little thing, wasn't she? Yes. Ugly too. And rather coarse. Mmm. No manners. Well, it's a wonder she was your friend at all. Excuse me. Perhaps she never truly was. Perhaps we all misjudged her. Come. Lovely to have met you. Magic is a delicate art. There are shadowy forces that must be controlled... harnessed. You begged an audience with me. You promised you would show me a vision of the man who killed my son. But my lord, I saw him. If I thought you were exploiting my grief just to gain license to practice your sorcery... He must be under some magical protection, hidden from the view of the potion. Prepare another. Last chance. I give you my word. You will see him. I had better. Ah, the little ragtags from the harbour. I want to wager for our ship. It's To your name. What would you offer as a stake? How much to see me bow down and kiss your feet? That would get you a foot of your sail cloth, or if you want you can win your ship back piece by piece. Let's play. Deal. I make a 9. 10. Congratulations. You get your sail cloth. Why don't we up the stakes this time. How about a personal slave? My whole life in your service. Would you waiver the whole ship to have me grovelling before you for the rest of your days, mmm? Hmph! This is insane. Deal. 7. 10. And the ship is ours. Cheers. You think I would give my ship to a piece of scum like you? The wager was made in good faith. The house rules demand you the house rules demand you honour that now. Abdule fahib. I hope your fortunes turn to dust! Sinbad! Please accept our most gracious apology. Will you stay awhile? Enjoy the hospitality? No, uh, Sinbad, we need to get back to the ship. One more wager. We have business in baruch. Oh come on, face of the goddess. You accept our invitation to dine. Why not? It's not late. No. Let's eat. Ooh. Aw. Perfect. You are my prisoner if they should ask. Shh! Seven weeks at sea and none of them appreciate fine food. Mmm. Oh. Oh! Mmm. Mmm! A little more salt, maybe, hmm? These places tempt you to stay longer so they can. You of everything that you own. I'm not going to stand here and watch you guys drown yourselves. Gunnar, Gunnar, come on. What's the problem? I have been in these gaming houses before and this one... This one has an animal stench about it. Mmm. The people cross the threshold and then they lose all sense of who they are. See? I knew when you came in here you were a true competitor. Look about you... a world of possibilities. Let's find ourselves something else. We can make a Baton. Image change. Yeah. I met a woman in the desert. She told me about this place. Wife of a gambler, lost everything. I bought her clothes. I sold her silk for a handful of silver and I thought that maybe if I cam here... >> There would be fat purses you. There would be fat purses you could steal, yes? You didn't give me away. I thought perhaps after what I did to you maybe... You're still a friend? Friends don't behave like that. Maybe I haven't had as much practice as you. Take care, Rina. The woman in the desert, she was crying. She said her husband was held prisoner here. There's something not right about this place. You don't need to worry about >> you don't need to worry about us. You saw him? You will leave the palace tonight, be gone from Basra by daybreak If you ever return your life is forfeit. Nala. Nala? Have you seen Sinbad? I'm busy. Can't find him anywhere. Sir. We have selected your champion. He's magnificent. So reckless. What's this? My choice... for the game. Compulsive gamblers, such fun. Such intense lives. Why don't you take your place. This gaming house, it's a trap. Ordinary games have lost their appeal for us. Human nature provides much more varied entertainment. Kill your opponent and we let you out of the cage. Only one comes out alive. One gold coin says my Sinbad kills your merchant, yes? So you bet on people's lives. We do. These men are twisted souls, very bored and very rich. We must not play their game, okay? And if we both stay resolute we will survive. Let's give you an extra incentive. They're matching us because they know we hate each other. They make us guess what's in the other one's mind. Do you really think there's a way that both of us can survive? Excellent. Wait. Don't do it. Just wait, wait, wait. Listen to me. Wait! Wait! We don't have to compete. Sooner or later, one of us will weaken and it's better if it's not me. Tell him to kill you. I don't want to kill you. Take his life and you'll be free. And what if we stay like this? What if neither of us dies? You will grow tired... Eventually. I will never kill him. The emulate, it frightens him. The curse. If I'm not back on my ship by dawn then I'll die. Then your entertainment is over. Let's play a new game. Soon the sun will come over the horizon and you will be dead but... you are free to leave, Sinbad, walk out the door when you wish, but if you go every one of your friends that you leave here behind... They will die with us. Sinbad! Sinbad! Help! Each of them is in one of these rooms. Find the key to release them from their bonds and bring them here. Do you dare to rescue them all before the dawn rises and your curse consumes you? Curse consumes you? The ship is yours. You do not need to stay and play just to save their lives. Help! Sinbad! Sinbad, help! Sinbad! Sinbad! Help! Ah! The dawn will soon be breaking, the dawn will soon be breaking, Sinbad. The final key. I have your key. Congratulations. No one has shown such spirit before. You're free to leave. You can't leave. A wager is a wager. Move. Don't want to lose your new toy? I want to play some more. No! No more. You know how this works, faris. You're jealous. You're jealous because I found one that's better than any of yours. That's why you want him out of here. Sinbad! Come with me. You always take my things away. Don't embarrass me. I know a way out. Come on, we're nearly there. I think he's dying. They must have put some kind of spell on him. No. He's cursed. What? If we don't get him off land before the sun rises he'll die. Quick, let's get him to the ship. Lady samarra, your ship awaits. Come on. Little fox found a packed runway. That smells very good. Ah, for today at least, we eat like kings. Where's all the food come from? Ah, an angel brought it to >> ah, an angel brought it to us. I want the truth. This curse, what is it? I'm ashamed that I couldn't tell you this before... But I did a terrible thing I had a brother... Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.Com
