 I hate your kind. (Grunting) (Crowd din) You're vermin infesting our city. You make me sick. (Crowd din) - Taker! - Yeah? What are the odds? (Fight din) On Raies, getting lower every second. No, no, no, the other one. Sinbad? You're joking. Look at him. Crowd: (Chanting) Raies! Raie Raies! - Raie Raies! - Put this money on Sinbad. Come on.

 (Crowd din) Fight. (Whack) (Chuckles) Come on! Finish him! (Crashing) (Grunting) (Grunting) (Scraping) (Fight din) (Crack) (Music slows) (Crowd din) (Booing) (Coins clinking) Raies. (Clinking) (Thud) (Crowd din) (Clinking) I see your future. Save it for tourists and travellers. I'm not interested. A gateway opened... Shadows are rising. The old ways are returning while our city burns. This... is... terrible. No. This is good. Sync by wilson0804 Corrected by icephoenix www.addic7ed.com (Crowd din) I'm sure they were onto us. They knew we were trying to fix the books. So? I'll just fight somewhere else next time. No. It's too dangerous. Left-hand side. The bag. What? Me? Yes. You, big brother. It's your turn. I'll distract him. You go for it. And don't worry. Today's going to be a good day. (Chuckles) You need to watch out for yourselves out here. And why would that be? Well, the market might seem like a friendly place but it attracts the worst kinds of people. - Really? - Hustlers, beggars, and pickpockets. Like this one right here. (Whistling) There's no need to involve the guards. What? He was stealing from you. You know what they do to thieves around here? They cut off their hands. Look at him. He's terrified. Is this man causing you trouble? He was attempting to steal from me. But he's been caught, he's been shamed, and we're willing to let it go. Father? If I catch you 'round here again... (Chain metal rattles) - Be more careful in future. - Thank you. We will. Father, your case. - Your case! - Hmm? Oh. They can't have. You were wonderful! So convincing! I was sure you were going to start crying. (Laughter) Another minute of him pointing and shouting "thief" at me - and I would have. - Oh, so sorry. It would have been nice if you had at least warned me. (Laughter) Yeah, but where's the fun in that? Sinbad, you should make life easy on yourself, be smart like me. - Sign up, join the guards. - Oh, yes, the guards! Join the guards and be a slave, Tazeem? - No, thank you. - Steady pay, a chance to see some action. Let's not forget how women feel about a man with a bit of power. - How is that girl you've been seeing? - Oh, she said those magical words to me. - "I think of you like a brother." - Ooh! And then she asked me about you, which was sickening. Try being related to him. (Laughter) - Peace be with you. - And with you. - Come on! - Ah! Will you be careful. Ow! I never get tired of this view. City as far as the eyes can see. (Banging) So many people, so many possibilities. Did I tell you about my dream the other night? Was it one where you just stopped speaking, for a moment? (Clang) (Grunt) - What is that? - I have no idea. Whatever it is, I don't like it. You hear of such things. Totems, charms. (Yelling) (Screaming) (Laughter) Don't! We bring bad luck to the unaware. (Rattling) Not now, it can't. Never mind. One day we'll get that big score. And we'll live in a big house and we'll never have to worry about anything again. Brother... I think you've taken one too many blows to the head. (Laughter) (Crowd din) Mother. I had a great day. We're going to eat well tonight. (Gasps) Hurt. Who, me? No, Amah, no, no. I'm fine. I keep telling him he should go to a doctor. (Patting) You didn't take him with you, did you? No! No, of course not. 'Cause you promised me. Yes, I promised you, and Jamil is far too smart to follow me around all day. Aren't you, Jamil? That's right. I've been at the marketplace trading. Really? What were you trading? Things. Expensive things. - (Whispers) Expensive things? - You're both terrible liars. Well, the main thing is we had a good day. (Clinking) - Yeah. - You see? (Smooch) (Clinking) (Gasping) (Whacking) Blood money. What? (Clinking) Amah. No. You have brought blood money into this house. - Amah, I swear, no. - You stupid boy. What have you done? (Banging) Go! Go! Run, Jamil, run. (Grunting) Sinbad, wait. (Grunting) (Laughing) Come on, come on. Sorry! (Men yelling) (Clattering) Come on! (Rattling) Come, brother! - No. - Brother! (Swords clanging) Brother! (Ominous music) I'm so sorry for your loss. But we must accept the path set out for us. Do not let this destroy you. You're a good man. Thank you, your highness. Once there would have been a way to bring back those who've passed on, to defeat death itself. (Birds chirping) My son... could live again? I wish it were so. But under the emir's regime, science is our master. Magic, it grows weak and fades. And so the dead must stay dead. Gone forever. He would have been emir one day and I would have guided his hand... Helped him rule. (Rattling) I used to feel sorry for those people that we'd see. Stumbling the streets, one hand missing, marked forever. - And now we're going to become one of them. - No. No we're not. We've been in far worse situations than this before. It's probably going to take some bribes and we might need Tazeem to put in a good word for us but we're to get out of this. Even now, behind bars, you think that you're right, - that everything will work out. - Yes, brother, because it will. So smile. Today is going to be a good day. (Light laugh) Yeah. (Door banging) You are aware of who I am. Yes. Um, you're Lord Akbari. And I believe you know my son, Raies, personally. - No. - I assure you, you do. (Footsteps) Like many his age, my son liked to prove himself a man. Drinking and gambling, fighting, which is where he met you this morning and where you left him lying in some sordid back street... dead. I didn't realize. My brother, the emir, has given me permission to deal with the situation as I see fit. As I see fit. Just hours ago, my son... was alive. And now... Come here. What does mercy truly mean? Is it a sign of strength or one of weakness? And then I think of your kind breeding in the alleys like rats infesting our city and the question of mercy falls into nothing. I accept whatever punishment you have for me. But please... My brother has nothing to do with this. This was me and it was me alone. Get back. (Fingers snap) (Keys jingling) (Banging) - Brother. Brother! - Just go. Just go, please. (Door clunking) Now, if mercy means nothing, I have to ask myself what punishment would ever be enough? (Sword clanging) (Jamil gasping) Jamil! Jamil! Jamil!!! No! (Banging) No! No! Let me out! As you took someone from me, so I take someone from you. Is it enough? No, not even close. Let me out! Come back here! Let me out! Jamil. Jamil! Get off me! No! (Thud) (Thud) (Groaning) (Slow instrumental music) (Door clunking) (Keys jingling) (Thudding) (Crowd din) He was a good boy. He would have gone anywhere, done anything for you. I'm so sorry, Amah. It's your fault he's dead. You'll never learn. And now your brother is gone. What am I to do with you? What am I to do with you? What am I to do? It is your fault that he's dead. It breaks my heart... to do this. But I must. One day, you will understand. (Sniffing) You will be cast out to drift, unable to set foot on land for more than one cycle of the sun. This is my gift to you. My curse so you can learn. Until you find atonement... you will never know peace. (Flames whooshing) (Sizzling) (Screaming) (Clunking) (Gasping) Tazeem: Sinbad. Sinbad. (Gasping) What have you done? - The guards, they're on their way. - I can't leave him. Tazeem: Sinbad, you've got to get out of the city. I've got to get back to the Garrison. Sinbad. Good luck, old friend. Peace be with you. And with you. (Gasping) (Birds squawking) (Bell clanging in background) (Conversation din) (Panting) What have you got? These furs and leather heading for the market in Serindit. You must be a long way from home, Northerner. It must be a change from the snow and cold. It'll still be there when I get back. (Clucking) (Clucking) (Thud) (Doors bang) (Slam) I'm sorry. I must have taken a wrong turn. I don't know how I ended up here. (Pained gasp) (Clink) They are mine. Hey. (Clink) (Shouting) Gang way. Come on. (Thumping) - What was that? - I think we've set sail. No. Not yet. Not yet. (Footsteps) (Boards creaking) (Frustrated groan) (Gasp) (Vomiting) (Spits) (Groans) I haven't quite found my sea legs yet. It's exciting though, isn't it? The... (Boards creaking) (Vomiting) (Spitting) Sorry. You're not too good either? I guess I haven't found my sea legs. (Soft laughter) (Gasping) It seems a little more serious... than that. (Clunking) Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Well, at least, I hope I do, otherwise we're all in trouble. Sorry. I'm... Anwar Shabani, the ship's doctor. (Waves lapping in background) It's my first time at sea, so. (Gasps) Ew. That doesn't look good. (Pained gasp) Yes, it might sting a little bit. Didn't you mean to tell me that before you put it on, not after? Yes. That's a good point. I'm going to get you some water and something for your fever. Oh. (Laughs lightly) (Gasping) (Waves crashing) Just to report, sir, there's an injured passenger in the hold. Hold's off limits to all but crew. Oh, of course. - Which passenger is it? - I didn't think to ask. All right, let's get back there. (Waves lapping) Anwar: He's injured. (Shuffling) Get up. (Gasping) Well, you're new? Do you have a name? (Smack) Sinbad. Tell me then, Sinbad, are you running to or from something? From. The usual way. Let's see what the fates have to say about you. (Clang) Somebody is looking after you after all. You're on crew until we reach the first port of call. Minimum rations, minimum comforts. I wouldn't do that if I were you unless you want a thief as part of your crew. - You're mistaken. - There is no mistake. No mistake at all. Young man, what you took from us, is it here? No. Um... I left it in Basera. - I can tell you where it is, if you want-- - It's too late. You have no idea what you have done, what that meant to us. - Father... - Maybe I was wrong. Maybe no one's looking out for you after all. - Lock him up in the cell. - Come on, dog. (Creaking) (Clang) (Lock rattling) Ah, Sinbad. (Banging) (Sighs) (Boards creaking) (Wind howling) (Thunder crashing) (Boards creaking) (Squealing) (Panicked gasps) (Clink) (Wind howling) (Grunting) (Thunder crashing) Hey, tie everything down. (Rattling) (Wind whistling) (Man shouting orders) (Water whooshing) Hello. (Clinking) - I'm trying to help you. - I'm sorry. (Muffled shout) Come on. - I was trying to help you. - I said I was sorry. Please don't kill me. (Panting) (Dripping) (Bubbling) (Roaring) (Splashing) (Screeching) What is that? (Screeching) Sinbad: I have no idea. (Screeching) (Screeching) (Splash) (Gasping) (Screeching) Not another step. (Screeching) It can't see us. (Screeching) It can't see us. (Splashing) (Screeching) (Screeching) (Prolonged scream) (Screeching) Stop. Don't move. I'll get it to follow me. (Roaring) (Splashing) (Screeching) (Loud splashing) (Thunderclap) Storm demons! (Roaring) (Splashing) (Roaring) (Screaming) Father! (Shouting) (Wailing) (Splashing) (Shrieking) - Pull! Secure the sail! - Can you hold it? (Wind gusting) (Waves crashing) (Storm demon shrieking) Father! Come on, help me! (Waves crashing) We need to secure the sail! (Thud) Man the tiller now! Man the tiller! Steer into the wave! Hurry, Sinbad, hurry! Into the wave! (Waves crashing) (Shouting) (Waves crashing) (Storm demon shrieking) (Waves lapping) (Seagulls calling) (Melodic instrumental music) Gone. (Whacking) (Grunts of pain) What you've stolen, you have no idea of its power. Look. (Clattering) (Clinking) The ship! It's listing to one side! We're sinking! (Dramatic instrumental music) The flooding must be coming from somewhere down here. (Thud) (Splashing) (Groaning) I can't believe this is happening. The water level down here is staying the same. There are no gaps and no leaks. So then it must be coming from down below. (Splashing) We need to seal this up, stop the water level from rising in here. - With what? - I know where they store the tar. - Can you melt it down? - On the deck. Go then. We haven't got much time. We need to check the fore-hatch, see if there's flooding there too. (Maniacal screaming) (Screaming) You're not one of them. They wouldn't scream like a little girl. (Splashing) Help! Help! Help please here! My leg, I can't move it! It's trapped. - Alright. Hold on. We'll get you out. - Don't leave! We can't let the water level rise up here. Not if we're going to survive. We need to seal it up too. Help me! - The ship, the ship is sinking. - I know. She told me. - She has been through a lot today. - Look. We need to heat this tar. - We're running out of time! - Better get a move on then! What are you doing? Go seal the other hatch. Help me please. Please don't let me drown. It'll be fine. I'll get you out. (Splashing) (Tapping) There's one other survivor, the ship's cook. (Coughing) Help me please! - We're safe! - There are two hatches. Both need to be sealed. Where's Sinbad? (Splashing) (Panting) (Splash) Not your time. Not yet. So, open your eyes, brother. Don't give up. Open your eyes. (Deep inhale) She's there! (Splashing) (Coughing) (Splashing) (Panting) (Dramatic instrumental music) (Footsteps) I'm sorry. I cannot find Sinbad. Perhaps your powers are not as strong as you believe. And perhaps that is for the best. You took a life from him as he took one from you. The blood debt is paid. My brother, you are wise and I have always listened to you, but the life of some street rat is no equal to that of the boy who... The boy who one day would have ruled this city! - I understand... - How could you! True. True. I have no son, no daughter. But I loved Raies as if he was my own. The blood debt is not satisfied. Sinbad will pay for what he has done. For the death of my boy, he will pay! (Ship creaking) - Well, you should both be dead. - Thank you. No, I mean, after what we've been through, the storm, those things. We should all be dead. Be thankful we're not. I am, really. You saved our lives. Steering us through that wave and then diving below, magnificent really. If I knew you were going to talk so much, I wouldn't have bothered. Eat. Wasn't a request. These people deserve a proper burial. So, does anybody actually know where we are? Brother, relax. Take a deep breath and smile. There's a whole new world of adventure out there.
