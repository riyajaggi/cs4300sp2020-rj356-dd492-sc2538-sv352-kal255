 About a Boy (2014–2015): Season 1, Episode 3 - About a Godfather - full transcript 
 Will (David Walton) attempts a much-needed boy's night out with Andy (Al Madrigal), but complications arise, leaving Will to reach out to Marcus (Benjamin Stockham) in hopes of salvaging the evening. When Andy later becomes available, he attempts to track down Will, but instead winds up bonding over the joys of parenting with Fiona (Minnie Driver). Meanwhile, Andy and his reluctant wife Laurie (guest star Annie Mumolo) solicit Will to be godfather to their son Jonah.

 - No! - Why are you downstairs? - Honey, why are you... - No! - You gotta do something. - Madison, you are going to bed. - Don't... - No! Honey, I need you to take the baby. - No! - Madison, you are going to bed. Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

 a really annoying tendency to bail last minute on boys' night... - No! - The other one of us decided to pick you up, negating the possibility of the bail. - [crying] - Can somebody make... - Can you make that stop crying? - No bedtime! - I'm sorry. - No, no, no! You gotta go to bed. I don't wanna go to bed! Yeah, I don't want to go to bed either, but you don't see me raging about it. - No! - Get a grip, tiny person. Put your jammy pants on right now,

 Or no cuddly-wuddly with me. Hey, if no cuddly-wuddly with your mom is an option, I would jump on that right now, baby girl. Well, look who left the big city to slum it in the east bay. - How'd we get so lucky? - [crying] Aah, can't we do something to stop this, please? God! So noisy. Yeah, Will, we have a remote that mutes them and freezes them in place, but it's out of batteries. - All right, let's go, let's go. - Hey, since you're here, there's actually something we wanted to talk to you about. - [sighs] - Now. All right, in the event that... [whispers] something tragic should happen to Laurie and I, we would like you to be Jonah's godfather. Well, not we. He. I just want to make that clear. - We. - What? Wait, if something... something tra... Tragic happens... You want me to raise it? I mean, we'd have to die simultaneously, and the chances of that happening are... I'm never dying. [crying] So... wow, guys. That is so, uh... I mean, he's cute. He's very, very cute. But I'm just gonna go with a "no." - You know. - What? We're going bowling! Let's go. Five minutes. I'm giving you five 'cause I'm a good friend. [Brick + Mortar's Old Boy] ♪ What up, what up, old boy? ♪ All right, you're being weirdly quiet. What's up? My child has no godparent, Will.

Hey, honey. Oh, my God, you've gotta be kidding. - All right. - Oh, no. - I gotta go home. - What? We're transitioning Madison onto the potty, and she won't poop unless I'm there. I'm her potty motivator. It's actually kind of sweet. [stammers] It's horrific. You are not bailing on me tonight. It's only gonna take about an hour, all right? - An hour to poop? - I'll be right back out. Just take me home. No, this car's not stopping till we get to the bowling alley. - Dude, seriously. - No. I am not letting you bail on me tonight. You know what? Andy, do not... [tires screech] Andy, come back here!

You moved to Cincinnati? Really, dude? [groans] Oh, trouble in paradise. No, it's just Andy bailed on me again tonight, and I already prepaid for the lanes, so it's like... Hey. Is there any chance that... Oh, let me stop you right there before you embarrass both of us. I'm not going to go bowling with you, Will. I'm sorry. Yeah, I was going to ask Marcus, Fiona. Oh. Yes! Yes! I totally bowl, Will! And I'm so much more awesome than Andy! [snaps fingers] Car's leaving in 30 seconds. If you're not in it, I'm outta here. [hip-hop music playing] First Andy bails on me, and now he's not answering my texts. - What's that about? - Oh. Thanks for bringing me here. Ooh, you should feel my pulse. This is the most excited I've ever been. Yeah? Is it more exciting than a pooping baby? Yes. [girls squealing] All right, dude. Let's see it.

She pooped, Will. Will! We can go out now! Will? He's... he's not in. Oh, hey. He's not here. I'm Andy, Will's best friend. You're Fiona. We met briefly, remember? - Yes! Hello. - How's it going? - Oh, good. - We were gonna go out. He took my son, Marcus, bowling. [sighs] that's unbelievable. I'm s... [stammering] I have a hall pass tonight, and he was just supposed to wait for one hour, so I could help my daughter poop. She won't poop without me holding her hand. You know, my son, Marcus, was a late pooper. And it was rough going. But actually, it turned out to be rather - a bonding experience for us. - Oh. What kind of wine you got there? - Glass of Shiraz. - Oh. Shiraz-a-mataz. - Ah, shiraz-a-mataz. - [laughing] - I've never had it. - Mm. - Probably delicious. - Not really, actually. Does the trick, though. - Ah. - [laughing] [bright music] - Oh, here's the one. - [gasps] So gorgeous, aren't they? And Will doesn't even know them. I mean, would it kill him to learn their names? - He must know their names. - No. He only knows that my kid's name is Jonah because he stole the name when he was using Marcus to get laid. Yes, I recall that. What do you think? I really like that, but I'm a toe guy. It's good, isn't it? Toes don't need to scream anything, do they? - Well... - Right, more booze. [clatter] oh, bugger. Do you see that? I've got to fix that. Let me. I can do it. - Are you handy? - So handy... That they call me "handy Andy." They don't. - They don't. - Ah. But you got any tools? I can probably fix it. Yeah, I've got a lovely crochet tool belt, actually. Okay, you're gonna love this. All right, we'll take the usual, kitty... Two prime rib French dip sliders and two Belgian fries with the pepper Jack Mayo. Oh, uh, no pepper Jack Mayo for me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. They are famous for their pepper Jack Mayo. Well, I'm famous for being lactose intolerant. Do you have any hemp spread? The look on your face says you could use some hemp spread too, bro. You know how hard I worked on Laurie to get her to agree to have Will be the godfather? Right? I love her to death, but she's just not as chill as you are, Fiona. Oh, thanks, Andy. [chuckles] You know, and then he just flat-out rejects me. I mean, doesn't even take it seriously. He's supposed to be my best friend, - and he doesn't even... - Yo! Just dropping off... What the hell is going on here? Hello, darling. Did you paint your toenails? Just testing colors. Nothing's going on. Handy Andy is enjoying the company of a considerate friend. Nice bailing tonight, wuss. Oh, I'm sorry. What'd you say, not Jonah? [laughs] oh! Yeah, no, he's my kid. Right. Could've waited an hour, Will. One lousy hour of inconvenience to you, and then we could've had our night out. - But no. - I agree with handy Andy. Well, I was enjoying the company of a friend who's free to have fun, wine teeth. Provided he finishes his homework first. Well, I think handy Andy needs to grow a set and quit bailing. - Marcus! - In my defense, I have no idea what any of that means. You know what? I'm outta here. Thanks for a fun time. Oh, I see. Bailing again. I'm not bailing. I'm just blowing you off. [whistles, laughs] [door opens and closes] [inhales] It was a Shiraz, right? 2005. Andy is either never around, which sucks, or he bails completely, which blows. So as a friend, Andy sucks and blows. Yes, I can see how his demanding schedule tramples on your boundless free time. You know, your sarcasm is ineffective against my absolute rightness... Although halfway through that, I closed my eyes, and I thought you were Adele. Do you have any awareness of the challenges going on in Andy's life right now? Yeah, his best friend is pissed at him. Andy and Laurie haven't been alone in months. Alex has anxiety going to kindergarten every day, and Madison can't poop unless Andy is standing right there. Yeah! How annoying is that? You know you have an absolutely one-sided friendship with Andy. Andy said that to you? No, I'm saying that, and so would Adele. It's always all about you, Will. It is with profound grace and humility that I accept your invitation to be the little... Baby Jonah's godfather. Uh... [chuckles] You're kidding, right? The offer has been rescinded. Rescinded? Ha. What? The appropriate answer when we first asked you would have been to weep and say that you'd be deeply honored. But instead, you snubbed us and made Andy jump out of a moving car. Made him? He opened the door and flew out! You know what? Just get out of my house, okay? Andy, help me out here, man. The truth is, you're not godfather material. - What? - It's really hard to raise - a kid, Will. - You have no idea. You're clueless. There's no time for anything else. We're so behind on Homeland, we don't even know if Abu Nazir is a bad guy. Abu Nazir is a terrorist! It couldn't be any clearer! Have you never heard of spoiler alerts? Honestly, this hurts. This hurts me, man. Oh, you have pain. [laughing] oh. That's hilarious. - It's hilarious. - Andy was so devastated by your shoddy treatment of him yesterday that he couldn't even get out of bed this morning. Oh, really? Is that why you couldn't get out of bed this morning? - Yeah. - Really? 'Cause I thought it was because he drank two bottles of Shiraz with my next-door neighbor Fiona last night! What? What? - I... - Who the hell is Fiona? The woman he spent the night with last night. - That's... - Spent the night with, Andy? Honey, we... I had a little bit of wine with her because he'd already gone out. All we did was talk about the kids. That's all we did. Is that all you did, handy Andy? Aw, man. Who the hell is handy Andy? Andy. I may have fixed her cabinet. Thank you. Hey, man. You know, I really wanted to go out with you last night. But you couldn't adjust your plans by an hour. One hour. It's not just about last night, Andy. You never have time for me anymore. I mean, we've watched the Super Bowl every year since high school, and last year, I got tickets to the Super Bowl, and you... and you bailed on me. For my wife, who went into labor, man. Ah, she knew I got those tickets, man. I think she self-induced. [crying] Oh! That's disgusting. That's my life. All right? And the fact that you consistently don't recognize that... It really bums me out that you haven't taken the time to bond with the kids. You don't even know their names. I absolutely know their names. Oh, really? Name them. Listen, I'm gonna bond with them, okay? When they're fully functioning. When they don't need, like, a team to go poop. I'm sorry, Will. This is who they are now. This is who I am now. You may be my best friend, but you have not been a good friend. Come on, guys. [soft music] Whoa, whoa, whoa, no spinning, okay? Foosball is a precision sport. It's a meticulous combination of soccer and surgery. Well, spinning is faster. Oh, my God, you should see Andy play. He's like the world's most precise surgeon and Ronaldo rolled into one. He once did a bicycle kick. A bicycle kick in foosball! I still don't know how he did it. [foosball rod spins] I love hanging with you, Will, But I can't handle your obsession with Andy. Andy is way out of line saying that I'm not a good friend. I mean, he's just taking his frustration out on me because he's not free to do the things he wants to do, And I am free to do them. But don't blame me for your freedom, which you don't have, or for not bonding with your infants, who are arguably incapable of bonding. Did you, like, think I became Andy halfway through that? Because that was really weird. I'm leaving, Will. No offense, it's just that until you work things out with Andy, I'd prefer to stay on my side of the dumbwaiter. Once again, I have something important and wonderful to tell you. You're not gonna be the godfather, Will. But if you wanna be Fredo, I'll gladly put you in a rowboat and shoot you. I'm not here to be the godfather, Laurie. I am here to be a friend. I would like to babysit the little people while you two go out and spend some alone time for a few hours. Just... or maybe a little less. A little less would be ideal for me. Um, and maybe I'll even bond with, um, Little Jonah and... And the girl and... Maddie and Alex. I'm gonna learn their names. That... this is awesome. This is amazing. Thank you so much, Will. See? Um, are you insane? We are not leaving our babies alone with him. Can we talk about it? There's nothing to talk about. I think there is something to talk about. [whispering] well, I think there isn't. Laurie, family meeting. Now. [gasps] I hate when you do that. Just let's go. We'll be right back. Come on. Just don't... let's go. - [chomping] - Fridge monster! Okay, it's back in the fridge. Crunch! Ah! Dude! Security deposit. Okay. So... did a little negotiating... Hey, by the way, that whispering thing was terrifying. Yeah, all right. Whatever. So Laurie's not gonna leave the house with you here, but you can watch the kids downstairs While we spend a little alone time upstairs. If that's cool. Mm-hmm. So you guys are gonna... while I'm down here. I mean, that's cool. I mean, not really, but let's just go with it. - Hey, thank you. - Okay, okay, okay. Okay. I've got a bottle prepared for Jonah, but if he's still hungry, there's cubes of frozen peas and squash in the freezer. Microwave them for 32 seconds. Not 35, not 30. You can cut up some apple for them, but leave the skin on. - It's full of antioxidants. - Okay, come on. Make sure you cut it into small slices, so they don't... [chokes] okay. You can put Jonah in his crib, but you must swaddle him first. You must. Also... Enough. Honestly, you sound like you're going away for eight years. I am here for 2 hours, not 3, not 2 1/2, okay? And I'm pretty sure "swaddle" isn't even a word. [laughing] oh. It's in the Bible, Will. The baby Jesus in his swaddling clothes. Okay, come on, come on, come on. - I'm not so sure. - Let's go. We'll be right upstairs if anything happens. Okay, hey, kiddos, have fun. Use protection. We don't want a troop surge. The second I leave, Jonah's gonna start to wail, but he will calm down at some point. Come get Andy if Madison has to poop, because she won't do it without him. - Come on, honey. - Oh, and Alex is a biter! Which one's Alex? - [crying] - Ow! Found him. [wailing] Okay, hello, I'm Will. I'll be your caregiver For the next couple of hours. Shall we begin the bondage? A-as in bonding? Not bond... not... - [fussing] - Moving on. You're Jonah, 'cause you're the baby. Listen, I understand you don't talk, but this whole crying thing is just... It's a nonstarter with me. So if you could just smile or hum if you have any concerns, appreciate that. Okay, you're Alex, 'cause you went all jaws on me, which I can't even tell you how uncool that is. I mean, who bites someone on the butt? And that makes you Madison, the gun-shy pooper. Listen, that situation of yours is so far out of my wheelhouse that, why don't we just agree that while I'm here, you'll eat nothing? [shrieking] Get back here, you little gangsters! No water weaponry on my watch! - [crying] - Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. I thought we talked about the crying thing, Jonah. Ooh, I'm a silly man. Silly man, silly man. [chuckles] You know what? This is just... whatever. [stops crying] Bull's-eye. Oh, my God. It's been too long. Way too long. Let's go. We don't have time. - I need this. - I know. [breathing heavily] All right, Abu Nazir. What do you got? - [dramatic music on TV] - Yeah, baby. Count with me. Both: One, two, Three, four... You know, I wouldn't necessarily drink beer like this at a bar, but if you're just chilling at home watching tube, it's pretty sweet. Check me, no hands, ready? Mm. [giggling] [laughs] Madison, are you having a stroke? She has to go poop, and that's a problem, 'cause dad's not here. Well, that's not a problem. We'll just get daddy. Mommy and daddy are having sexy time. You know what? I got this. [upbeat rock music] [whistling melody] Okay. I'm gonna leave you here, and then you do your business, and then we'll go back to watching the tube, you know. We gotta see if dora and boots can save the crystal kingdom, 'cause they're up against it. No! I can't be alone. Uh, well, that's kind of how this whole thing works. Maybe I'll stand out here, and then you can do your thing? I want my daddy. Oh, okay. Okay, okay, okay. I'm here with you. I'm here with you, Madison. All right? It's okay. And there's no reason to be scared. Sometimes my daddy holds my hand, which sometimes helps. Oh, I'm... I'm generally not a hand holder. I... Sometimes my daddy sings. That helps. Really? What kind of music are you into? You like hip-hop? You like country? You like hair band stuff? Pop! Goes the weasel. Oh, that's a good choice. [clears throat] Yeah. [inhales] ♪ All around ♪ ♪ Some kind of bush ♪ ♪ The monkey chased the weasel ♪ ♪ The monkey stopped to take a leak ♪ ♪ Pop! Goes the weasel ♪ [gasps] I did it! [laughing] I love you, Will. [laughing] I I... I love you too, Madison. Oh, my God. [tender music] Thanks, man. - Can you wipe me, Will? - Okay, your daddy's here. - "And I vow to better myself..." - Better myself. "So I can be a better godparent to you." I'm not saying this. This is stupid. - Say it. - I'm not gonna say it. - Say it! - Come on. "And I vow to always love you As if you were the fruit of my own loins." - It's beautiful. - It is sick. - I'm done. - What? - I'm outta here. - What are you doing? Seriously? Oh, that's... okay, that's right. You just go back on over the bridge! City trash! - [crying] - Real classy! You did this, Will!
