 About a Boy (2014â€“2015): Season 2, Episode 14 - About a Boyfriend - full transcript 
 To Will (David Walton) and Fiona's (Minnie Driver) surprise, Shea (guest star Izabela Vidovic) accepts Marcus' (Benjamin Stockham) proposal to be his girlfriend. However, Shea's idea of a boyfriend translates closer to a personal assistant than a companion. Elsewhere, Fiona attempts to be more spontaneous with Chris (guest star Chris Diamantopoulos), while Will chaperones Marcus and Shea's frozen yogurt date. Al Madrigal and Annie Mumulo also star.

 All right, you may be wondering why I've gathered both of you here today. Your email said that there would be breakfast pastries. Budgetary constraints. I've decided it's time for me to take it to the next level with my LOML. - Your what now? - LOML. It stands for "love of my life." I'm trying to make it the next big acronym. That's gonna be an uphill battle. Darling, what do you mean by "next level"? I want to ask Shea to be my girlfriend.

 Oh, n-na... Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ho-ho-ho... Hold on. Hold on. I don't know... I don't know if we could be any happier for you. - Really? - Really. - Really? - Yeah. - Go get her. - Go get her. Thanks, you guys. I'm gonna go work on my ask. What was... what... What was that? Huh? Because Shea is not who I intend to be my someday daughter-in-law. - What? - Yeah. No, it could happen. First they're dating. Then Marcus is struggling to pay child support

 for their unplanned twins. Job market's crap, and the next thing you know, he's had to take a job modeling to pay the bills. - He... he does? - First it's catalog. But the runway always comes calling. Shea and Marcus are never going to date. Shea will never say yes to him. How do you know that for sure? Give me an S-H-E... Give me an A. What does that spell? - Shea! - Yeah. His irrepressible joie de vivre will be wasted on the likes of Shea. Yup, so why forbid it and become the bad guy for no reason? I am brilliant. You're welcome. So what, we just let him go out there and get his heart broken? Look, I don't want the little dude hurting any more than you do. You know, but being rejected by a girl is kind of like a male rite of passage. Like, it's like going from briefs to boxers or boxers to boxer-briefs. Yeah, but he still wears the ones with the Spider-Man on his bottom. Trust me on this one, okay? It's not our job to intervene. It's our job to be there to comfort him and to pick up the pieces. Okay. I suppose you're right. I hate saying that. Here we go. Knock, knock. - Hello. - Hey. How are you? Oh, wait. Did we have plans? I'm so confused since I switched from the Jewish calendar to the lunar calendar. No, no, no, no, no, no. We didn't have plans. Tonight is a huge meteor shower, and I figure if we leave now, we have time to get up to my friend's observatory in Oregon. Pack your bags. We are going on an adventure, baby. Oh, that sounds incredible... baby. But you know, I've got to stay with Marcus tonight. Yes, of course. Ah, I'm so sorry. I got caught up in the excitement. I mean, you know how I get about meteors. I know, well, you go and enjoy the shower, and then we're still on for tomorrow, right? Yes, of course. We are one for dinner tomorrow night here at your house again. Oh, I didn't mean it like that. No, no, no. I meant... Tomorrow night. Dinner here again. 'Cause I'm gonna make pesto. But get this: I'm gonna infuse the pine nuts with red cabbage so it's pink. Pink pesto. - Mm-hmm. - How wild is that? - That's pretty wild. - Right? - I can't wait. - Okay. - Bye. - Tomorrow night. - Yeah. - Okay. Oh, cabbage. You are not what men want. As this graph clearly demonstrates, we've experienced a steady increase in affection over time. Insults are down. Texts are up. And last month, one butt dial. But this month, eight intentional calls. Basically, what I'm trying to say here is: will you be my girlfriend? - Why? - I like you. Have you ever had a girlfriend? - No. - Then why do you want one now? - I like you. - What's the catch? I am. It's a little joke. Uh, no catch. Grieving but healing. What is that smell? Why are you spraying lingerie with sour juice? It's not sour juice. It's patchouli water. I am preparing a grieving robe for Marcus to deal with Shea's rejection. Patchouli robe. Are you comforting Marcus or a middle-aged lesbian? I am gonna help Marcus get over Shea like a man with a six-pack and some dead animals. Oh! That is comforting, actually. Hey, guys. - Hi, darling. - Hey, buddy. Shea said yes! I'm a boyfriend now. Wait. And you made me ribs. And a victory robe to celebrate. This is the bet day ever. Ho! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Buddy. Those are completely raw. And you saved me from salmonella. Even better best day ever. Yes. Victory. I just can't believe that my little baby has a girlfriend. And thank you, Will. You... You're welcome? You stopped me from shutting down what could turn out to be the grand love story of Marcus's life. I did? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I did. You know, the thing is, Fiona, I always had a hunch about that Shea. It's quite ironic that Marcus's love flower blossoms while mine wilts or, rather, dries up from boredom. Okay, number one: never, ever talk about your love flower drying up, and number two: what's wrong? Is there trouble brewing in swarthy teacher land? Chris always wants to go on these spontaneous adventures. "Let's go surfing right now," he says. But I'm a mom. I need notice. I really want to plan an adventurous date. Well, you can't plan an adventure, you know. That undermines its inherent adventure-ness. What should I do? I don't know. You know, anything. You could be sitting down for dinner and you'd be like, "You know what would be awesome? Some truffle oil." And then you guys just get up. You just forage for truffles. Okay, well, it'd be awesome... what? What was the last bit there? Wha... truffle oil, but that... That was just an example, Fiona. A perfect example. Hold on to your hat, Chris. We're going truffle hunting on a whim. Brilliant! Oh, boy. - Hey, girlfriend. - Hey, Pasty. Ah, sweet relief. If I'm still soaking in ten minutes, unplug this. I got to get started on Shea's homework. You shouldn't be doing errands for Shea. That's not what a boyfriend does. - It's not? - No. Well, that explains why none of the other boyfriends at school have developed shin splints. You need to change the dynamic of your relationship with Shea ASAP. - How? - By taking her on a date and making her see you as a man, all right? Otherwise you're gonna turn into a whipped, neutered shell of your former self. Fire up the Xbox. I got 15 minutes until I have to pick up Laurie's eyeglasses and then get her skirt suits from the dry cleaner. What? Why are you guys looking at me like that? Oh, my God. I'm turning into Andy. Okay, not yet. You still got a lot of time. Just relax. Guys, I'm standing right here. Quiet, Andy. Men are talking. All right, I'll ask her out. All right, what are you gonna do? You do a little text action? - Um... - All right, here we go. I, uh... Just be direct, all right? Got it. Okay. "Will you go on a date with me?" That's solid. No nonsense there. "Ok." - She said ok! - Yeah, buddy! Whoo! Why are you so excited? Oh, I don't have to pick up the skirt suits until Wednesday. - Oh, boy. - Hey! You the man! Oh, the meteors, they looked like a million tiny, little shooting stars. It was one of those nights where I was just glad to be alive and in the moment. You ever had one of those? Oh, no. This pasta is terribly bland. No, I think it's delicious. I wonder what it needs. Maybe a little black pepper. I've got it. Truffles. Let's go scavenging for them right now on a whim. Um, okay. Great. Oh, no, wait. I better just blow out the candles 'cause of the fire hazard. Oh, let 'em burn! Adventure! Here I come. Okay, here she comes. Quick: hit me withhe ground rules one more time. All right, always stick to the date plan no matter what she says. Always hold the door. Never hold her purse. Boom! You got this. - Yes. - Come on. Go. Oh, my god. Look at how cute she looks. I'm gonna hold whatever she wants me to hold. Marcus, remember Andy. Pathetic. Andy. Pathetic. Andy, Andy, Andy. Hi. You're perfect. I mean, um... What's up? Oh, right. Pasty. Skinny jeans. Blue... highlights hair. Good one. Marcus, why don't you tell Shea about the date you got planned tonight? Well, we'll be sharing an evening of bowling, along with fries, arcade games, and a pitcher of orange soda. No. Swirl Jam for frozen yogurt. Skinny Jeans! To Swirl Jam. Ooh! Look. I think... ooh, I found another one. Mm... Not a truffle. If you eat this, you'll get epic hallucinations and almost definitely die. Let's put that over there. Gosh. Is there anything that you don't know? Well, I didn't know where tonight was gonna lead us and that we'd be out here, off the grid. Oh, no service! Hmm? - Everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I... you know, it has been a lovely adventure, hasn't it? But should we head back and truffle up our dinner? We could, or... I know a fantastic hot spring about 15 minutes up the road. We could hike. Oh, well, we don't have our bathing suits. Neither did Adam and Eve. Well, that's not strictly true, 'cause Eve had the fig leaf two piece. Just trust me. All right, so you got your classic flavors: you got chocolate, vanilla, peanut butter, but if you're feeling a little adventurous, you could take a walk on the peppermint mocha side. Gonna need some samples, Pasty. On it. First time? - What's that? - Chaperoning? We do the whole "be cool and hang back" thing. - Which one's yours? - Uh, Marcus. Oh, Marcus is the one that's dating Shea now. - Oh, my gosh. - It's very weird. It's a very weird relationship. She's, like, popping right now from relationship to relationship. Excuse me... what are you guys talking about? Shea just broke up with Viper, that dark little storm cloud behind the counter. It was quite the uggo splitsky. No bueno. I'm having a little trouble understanding your mom speak. What does that mean? I'm saying that Shea is using Marcus to make Viper jelly. And jelly means jealous? Obvi. Obvi. - That's no bueno. - Mm-mm. Voila! What a beautiful view from right here. Come on, we can sit and watch this anytime. Let's do this, Fiona. Come on. They all naked, do you think? - Probably. - Probably, aren't they? All right. You're not gonna keep your short... You don't have to keep your short... no. Listen, I figure you can put your dress in my shirt so it doesn't get dirty. Oh, gah! Isn't that funny how that's the... The exact thing I was worried about. Ha! Oh, here, give me your coat. That's white; don't want to get that dirty. Put that right there. Uh... all right. Well, there we are. Just... ah! Nothing you haven't seen before. Ooh! Brisk, isn't it? Put that right in my shirt. And here I am, naked in the woods, feeling wind in places I've never actually felt wind before, about to take a bath with a bunch of strangers. Come on. - Ah. - Ooh! See? This isn't so bad. Hey, look at you! You're doing it. I know! I'm doing it! I'm skinny dipping! There's nothing between my body and the water. Ah, this is amazing. And you look beautiful! Oh, I am! I'm beautiful and naked and free! Police! Run! What? - Ah! - Freeze, ma'am! Ah! What's happening? Uh, this is a... A wildlife reserve, so technically, we're trespassing. Put your hands up and slowly come out of the water. All right. Could... could you chuck us a towel first? Could you? Come out of the water. No? Okay. Hey, Marcus! Hey, we need to talk. Did you know that that guy right there is Shea's ex-boyfriend? Viper? Really? Man, I got to work on my facial hair. I think Shea might be using you to make Viper jealous. No way. Shea would never do that. Well, then why did she bring you here? 'Cause my girl loves her some fro yo. Look, I don't want to keep my date waiting, so if you'll excuse me. Oh, hey, what's up? What a co-wink-a-dink, right? So could I just get one half coconut, one half mango for my girlfriend, Shea, please? All right. "Sloot?" No, you spelled it wrong. Her name is Shea. S-H... I know her name, but seeing how she's ugly and stupid and worthless, I think my name for her is much better. My girlfriend, Shea, is beautiful, kind, and amazing, and I would appreciate it if you didn't talk about her that way. - You would, would you? - Yeah. I would. What are you gonna do about it? I don't know, I haven't really gotten that far. Well, ha! Uh! Uh! Mm. You just lost your tip. That was crazy. I mean, one minute we're eating pasta, and then boom! We're in the woods, naked, with sirens flashing. That's one for the ages. Yes. Good story. Oh, Fiona, don't worry. This won't go on our record. They'll let us off with a warning. Oh, no, it's not that. I'm... I... it's just I can't have adventures like this very often. I mean, I could before Marcus, but not anymore. Well, that's... That's okay. Yeah, no, it is... It's okay for me. I love being Marcus's mom, but I can't drop everything at a moment's notice and go see a meteor shower or go surfing or skinny dipping. And I'm not sure what I have to offer is enough for you. Look, I don't need meteor showers or mushrooms or hot springs. Fiona, you and me... We're the adventure. Okay, you two. We've dealt with the others. Ah! We are ready for the warning. Yeah. Warning? No, we're taking you two downtown. Well, not downtown. Actually, our precinct's in a pretty rural area, but you're still getting booked. They usually, uh... let you off with a warning. Usually. So what's it gonna take for you not to sue? How 'bout a lifetime of free frozen yogurt? Really? That's it? Absolutely. Damn, I think I undershot. Hi. Hey. Did you just agree to be my girlfriend to make that Viper guy jealous? Because I really like you, and I think it would be nice to have a girlfriend that actually likes me back. When I first said I'd be your girlfriend, it was mostly 'cause I liked having you around to carry my stuff. And yeah, also make Viper jealous. Oh. I guess it was just hard to believe that you were for real, 'cause usually, guys date me because they've heard rumors about me or because they know my mom's never home and that we always have beer in our fridge. But hearing you say all that nice stuff about me... Now I know you're for real. You're still totally weird, but you're for real, and I've never met anyone like you, Pas... Marcus. Man, I can't believe she kissed me. Next time, I am totally gonna kiss back. Yeah, you are! To kissing back! Kissing back! Here I am! How did it go? Sorry I was off the grid. Tell me everything. So Shea was only using me to make her ex jealous. What? Will! But then I stood up to Viper. Wait... Shea has an ex called "Viper"? And then Shea realized she wanted to be my girlfriend for real, and I got kissed. Oh, darling, you got kissed! It was pretty much the best night of my life. Marcus, that is so wonderful. And next time, he's gonna kiss back. Darling, listen, you go upstairs and get ready for bed. I'm gonna come up and hear all the details. All right. Wait until you hear about the part where I got punched in the stomach. You got punched? And kissed. Best night of his life. But it could've been the worst. You know he has a very sensitive stomach because of the lactose allergy and his hypersensitive navel, - You can't... - What is going on with your fingertips? Why do you have ink on them? That's... that is just some rubber stamp work From holiday cards. Christmas was months ago. What's going on here, Fiona? It's fingerprint ink from down the precinct, where we got arrested for skinny dipping. Ho-ho-ho-ho! Adventurous Fiona skinny dipping! Looks like someone's dried-up love flower got wet! Listen, I'm gonna make you a deal. You're gonna take my skinny dipping arrest to the grave, And I'm gonna spare you the lecture On what a rubbish chaperone you are. - Lady, you got yourself a deal. - All right. Although, your skinny dipping definitely trumps my chaperoning. Right. Now you're gonna get a lecture. One: You're a rubbish chaperone. Two: You are a very poor judge of character. Three: You're far too tall, Sasquatch. Four: You're an idiot. Five: Snip, snip, snip on your eyebrows, okay? Six: Your hair's too big, and it's not the humidity.
