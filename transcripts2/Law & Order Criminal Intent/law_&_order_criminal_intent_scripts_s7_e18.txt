 [Cheering, bell clanging] What the hell is this?! What the hell is this?! Hey! [Cheers and applause] The title fight's next. You did it. Yeah, and no one believed I could. Hey, you're gonna be the champion, bro. And you're next. You'll get your shot, Peter. Come on. I'm buying tonight. Wow! You hear that, little brother? Gus is actually paying. Yeah, 'cause he knows we've already got plans. What? Christina. So? She'll come along like always. Well, we're gonna, you know. We haven't seen each other in a week. Oh, what was I thinking? Have your fun without me. You did great. You were great. Oh, my god, are you okay? Yeah. Aw! [Claps] See you later, champ. Hey. Whoo! Mr. Gold? Nice moves. Your left. You been working on that? You're full of surprises tonight. I love boxing. It's so... animal. It's, uh, it's nice to meet you too. (Man) You like that, honey? Leave me alone. (Gus) Listen, I'm gonna hit it. What? We just got here. Now listen, I'm an old man. You're the hero tonight. Gus, look, hey, you know I couldn't have done it without you, right? So how many guys you knocked out? That's it, bitch. [Winces] Hey, easy with the girl! [Hinges on door squeak] [Woman screams] Yeah, what! What? What? Yo! Leave the girl alone, boss. What, are you gonna hit me, dude? Come on, tough guy. No one has to get hurt, guys, all right? Just let the girl be. Walk away. Aah! [Tires screeching] [Panting heavily] [Groans] Synced & corrected by shadowmoon Mike Logan? Yeah. Peter gardella asked me to call you. Says you know him. Yeah, I worked with him as a kid. P.a.i., staten island. Is he okay? He is, but his older brother... Gabriel. Took a bullet to the leg. Bled out in the ambulance. Bar altercation. Slug hit the femoral artery. One shot killed him? Anywhere else, he would have taken the hit. I mean, he's a professional boxer. He tkoed the number two-ranked middleweight tonight. His brother see this go down? No. Met us at the E.R. He's waiting in the hallway. Pete. Mike. You all right? The bouncer called me, and Gabriel was just trying to save this girl. Just... just slow down here. Where was Gabriel drinking? Conlan's on grand Avenue. All right, I'm gonna call my partner and we're gonna roll on this right now. Yeah, I'm gonna go with you. No, no, no, no, no. You've got paperwork here. You're better off here. Now, you got a girlfriend or something that can be with you? I don't want her here. Gus, uh, Gabriel and me, our manager, we live at his house. You wait here for Gus then, okay? Don't you worry. You find out who did this to my brother, Mike. Call your precinct. Tell them major case is taking this one, okay? Thank you very much. So you were a mentor to this kid Peter? His mother's dead, his father's in sing-sing. I introduced him to boxing and took him out for burgers after. He's done all right. He won the gloves. The amateur championship? Turned pro a year ago. Was his brother a boxer too? A very talented one, but it didn't do him any good last night. This hottie's boyfriend was a dick. They were both wasted. Are they regulars? I never seen them before. So what do you think? Did Gabriel put himself in the middle of their drunken spat and get himself shot? I don't know. I didn't see. I was working the door. I wish I took the two steps. My god, I should have made him. You on the job? Brooklyn north. I vested last year. I did hear shouts. The woman screamed. Then a gunshot. Then a motorcycle revs up. Two sets of tracks. Yeah, it could have been two bikes I heard. By the time I got to the scene, they were gone. Did you make the girl on her own bike? Not in that skirt and heels. The dick could have had a buddy. Was he carrying in the bar? He looked sketchy coming in. I patted him down. He was clean. So the second guy had the gun. I did a canvass. Nobody knew these people. Both white, early 30s. Guy wore a cap. She was a knockout for a lush. Detectives, a .22 beretta. Esu fished it out of a sewer two blocks away. We might get lucky with prints. Do what you can. We'll send over a sketch artist. How'd they pay for their drinks? They didn't. It was the first thing I asked the bartender. Gabriel's manager Gus Kovak was buying rounds for the house. You wanna go with blue or white? I don't know, Gus. What'd the guy at the funeral parlor say? He said, "pick out a shirt and suit", something he liked." Gabriel wore this the night he knocked out Wilson. Remember, I took you boys to Peter luger's? Yeah. He had two orders of chicken. Home-style. Who orders chicken at Peter luger's? He liked chicken. [Doorbell rings] There was a young lady talking to Gabriel. Long hair, nice looking. (Logan) Do you recall any of their conversation? Well, she could smell the victory on him. And her boyfriend didn't like that? A big white guy, had too many to drink. Listen, Gabriel didn't provoke this in any way. He was a perfect gentleman. How long did you train Gabriel for? Five years. Peter too. Did you ever see Gabriel fight? Yeah. It's funny to get a champion after all these years. Mike, this is Christina. Peter talks about you all the time. I made pirogis. [Speaking Polish] Listen, I'll get out of your way. If there's anything I can do... We'll be in touch. [Pager beeping] Uh, Pete, if you need me, you got my number, okay? And it's nice to meet you. We got a hit on the beretta. A legal purchase from a gun shop in Greenville, south Carolina. The buyer lives in Philly. Yeah, so how'd the gun end up in New York? A gun? No way would I buy a gun. I've never even been to Greenville. Looks like someone used your I.D. Was your wallet stolen recently? Uh, it's my daughter Callie. She's got, uh... She's got substance abuse issues. Well, we're gonna need to talk to her. No. We lost touch. I can't enable anymore. I haven't seen her in over a year, not since she left jakey with me. You know, she's still a good mother. She sent me 500 bucks last week. I bought him that... That tricycle. Which one do you want me to pick out? I want you to pick the girl you saw. Focus, Gus. Concentrate. Listen, did you ask the bartender? Did you ask the bouncer? All right, I think it's her. Yeah, she's the one. A sweet girl. It turns out she's not so sweet. No, I don't understand. We gave out five grand for information. Where is she? Well, you hesitated before. I mean, did you actually recognize her? Maybe you mistook her for a groupie hanging around the boxing ring. No. Gabriel wasn't like that. He kept his eye on the prize. I never seen this girl before in my life. She got my brother killed. [Door buzzes] Yeah, that's Callie. What's she in trouble for now? We just want to talk to her. [Pounds] Callie Johnson! NYPD. Callie? Callie. Oh, oh, oh! (Logan) She's got no pulse. Looks like an od, huh? They cleaned her out. Except for this. Her son. Callie Johnson did die of an overdose. And there's something else interesting in the tox screen. Besides the heroin, she had fentanyl in her system. It's 80 times more potent than morphine. She was trying a new high. Or someone gave her a burn back, wanted to make sure she died. You have any cluster ods the last few days? Nope. Nothing from her neighborhood. That means there wasn't a bad batch on the streets. Okay, so why was she killed? Well, you can't trust a junkie, right? I mean, she played her part. She got Gabriel to defend her. So boom. Callie was an addict, but she doesn't come forward to collect the $5,000 reward? Could have been afraid. She did have a record and a nasty boyfriend. You mean an accomplice? Either way, any leads? The super says a lot of guys came and went. No one special. And her mobile records only show calls to no-name cells, probably her dealers, and her mother. Her mother did tell us that Callie sent her $500 for her little boy a week ago. Blood money for luring Gabriel out of the bar and to his death. Someone knew Gabriel was a soft touch. Find out who. I want to stay with you, baby. You don't need to do that. I'm just gonna go hit the bags. Okay. I love you. Yeah. I love you too. Yeah? Bye. [Giggles] Bye. Come on, Peter. What are you do... Show me you're a puncher. Show it to me! Wake up! And time! Time! Come here. What the hell are you doing? You're embarrassing yourself! Think Gabriel would want you to run away like that in a fight? Now get back in there and show me the power. Show it to me. Show me what you got. Show me what you got! Show me what your brother thought you had. You're a puncher! That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. Everybody loved Gabriel. I don't understand. Did your brother have a habit of being a knight in shining armor? Like I told you, he was a gentleman always. And everyone knew that about him? When my mom was still alive, my dad used to pop her pretty good. Gabriel couldn't stand it. He wouldn't even let anybody swear around a woman. Did Gabriel owe anyone money? These boys are taken care of. They live with me rent-free. (Logan) How about girlfriend troubles? Anything like that? (Peter) No. What about another boxer? Did he have a beef with anybody? No. My brother, he didn't pick fights. He didn't have anything to prove. Well, no offense, he did hit people as hard as he could for a living. You don't get it, do you, miss? I mean, you don't see the poetry. Some people don't. No offense. All right, well, let's talk about Gabriel's last fight. So you were out celebrating? Calvin's people thought this was just a tune-up bout. Calvin's next fight was for the title. Till Gabriel got in the way. You got a tape of that last fight? Can't see. (Peter) Yeah, my brother called the fight. He knew Calvin was going blind. After that punch to the eye. You can see his retina is detaching. First you see a lot of floaters and then it's lights out. Is that the poetry you were talking about? Hey, my brother could have destroyed the guy. He did the right thing. What you taught me, Mike... Control, use your head, fight to win, not to kill. That's it. No more, no more, no more. How big an upset was Gabriel's win? It was huge. They underestimated him. (Gus) They took Gabriel for granted. Pete, turn that up, would you? You fag! We're just fighting! I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch! You're dead! You're dead! One more punch, Calvin's blind in that eye. My brother saved him. Calvin didn't seem too grateful. He disrespected me. How, by winning? Who the hell is he to stop the fight? He saved your eye. And took my title shot 'cause of a lucky punch. Well, which one? I mean, he hit you a whole bunch. You were there? No, but we watched the tape. We also saw how you were shouting that you wanted Gabriel dead. I say that every fight. I'm gonna eat your children, I'm gonna "f" you up. It's part of the game, man. It's psych. A little late. The fight was already called. I was pissed. Later, my wife said what you said. She said he saved my eye. She was right. I owe Gabriel. A shame, what happened to him. Where'd you go after the fight? I went straight to the operating room to reattach my retina. I'll be champ in eight months. You seem pretty sure about that. What happened Saturday night wasn't supposed to happen. Gabriel should not be dead because he should not have been out celebrating. Why not? It should have been me in the sixth round. That was the deal. Maybe if it was, I'd have gotten shot. The deal? Gabriel was supposed to take a dive? Insurance for your title shot? I'm done talking. They got me doped up. I gotta rest. Well, if Calvin thought the fix was in, he might have dropped his guard. The fix? Maybe in Calvin's doped-up mind. No way Gabriel threw the fight. Or maybe he changed his mind. Wheeler, the boy lives a simple life. If he was getting paid, where's the money? Gabriel never spent a dime. He opened his wallet, moths flew out. He didn't carry cash? No. He said he'd just spend it. Okay. Well, what did he do with his share of the purses? Did he have a savings account? Christina put it in her account. Christina, your girlfriend? Yeah, she has us on an allowance. I mean, she did when she lived here. And all four of you lived here together? Yeah. It was great. I mean, she cooked and everything. Why are you guys asking about Gabriel's money? It may be connected to why he was killed. No, I told you. He didn't owe anybody. Come on, Pete, we're not saying that. (Wheeler) Mind if I take a look in his room? Yeah, yeah. Whatever you gotta do. And why did Christina move out? Uh, her sister has three kids, and she needed live-in help. It's good practice for when we have our own little rugrats. Your own ru... What, are you getting married? When I make it, I'll get out of here, get one of those condos you see in the ads with the playroom. Gus will visit, like a grandpa. Yeah. Good for you. Hey, Logan. I'll be right back. The felt's been pulled away and taped back over. That's got to be, I don't know, ten grand? What's that? Wait in the kitchen, Peter. I want to know, what is that? Take it easy. I trusted you! You bitch, you planted that! Whoa, whoa, whoa! I did what? You planted it! There's no way! No, I know what you were asking me. You were trying to say my brother was taking money? Hold off, Pete. Hey, that is it! Outside! Come on, outside! Outside! He was clean, Mike. He was clean. He was a broken fighter. How bad? Broke, always broke. He was honest. Who told you he wasn't, huh? Who said that to you? All right, now, you're out of line. I know my partner. She did not plant that. Now, what was Gabriel doing with that money in his room? I don't know! I don't know! It's not what you think, though. All right, take it easy. 'Cause it's not what you think. All right, take it easy! What is it? Just tell me what's going on. Look, I'll believe you. He was my brother, Mike. He was my big brother. [Crying] [Crying] I handle their money, Peter and Gabriel. They don't even have atm cards. I mean, the only way they get cash is when I give it to them. Well, maybe Gabriel was getting something extra on the side. We didn't have secrets between us. They have no money. I cook for them. You should look in the freezer, the meals. I gave them an allowance of $100 a week. He could have saved up the ten grand. How? He couldn't make his hundred last a week. Boxers, they end up with nothing. They get old, hurt. Peter's just starting out, but Gabriel had a winning record. The purses add up. Not like you think. He makes $20,000 at the most, and taxes, expenses. His expenses. What about Kovak? What, he gets 10%, right? That's the standard trainer's fee. Plus a third for being the manager. Mm-hmm. Who keeps the books? Kovak used to. I double-check everything now. Oh, you double-check, huh? What's the matter, you don't trust him? That cash, there is no way Gabriel could have saved it on his own. What are you insinuating? (Wheeler) Calvin thought he had a deal. Gabriel was supposed to go down in the sixth. That's just Ziggy gold playing mind games, trying to make his kid think he had an edge. This promoter, Ziggy gold. Calvin was one of his boxers? Listen, I put five years of blood, sweat, and tears into Gabriel. Gold knows I wouldn't throw that away. (Wheeler) would gold approach Gabriel? We found ten grand in cash in Gabriel's room, Mr. Kovak. What... Gabriel would never take a dive. He didn't. Any chance he took the money? I thought gold was just upset about the loss, about... About Calvin not getting his shot. What are you talking about? Gold came into the dressing room after the fight. Apparently he had some business with Gabriel. Really? Were you in the room? No. He waited for me to leave. But I've been in the boxing world 30 years. I've got eyes and ears everywhere. So gold, was he mad? I heard he was smiling. That's when he's dangerous. [Camera shutter snapping] (Gold) You're watching too many old movies. It doesn't happen. Well, right up to the bell, the line kept moving. The odds were against Gabriel, but by Friday, forget about it. And there was a lot of side action on that sixth round ko. Boxing gamblers, they make wild bets. Did you lose big, Mr. Gold? You're a homicide detective? I got a daughter your age. Well, Gabriel was quicker than we thought. You mean, he took your payoff and then backed out of the deal? He got lucky with his left hook. It cost Calvin his title shot. That had to hurt you. Word is, he was shot by some thug. And you've never had a thug on your payroll? 17 indictments for extortion, fraud, manslaughter. No convictions. 17 and 0. Besides, the king is dead. Long live the king. I lost Calvin, I gained a great white hope. You cut a deal with Gabriel? Gabriel and I shook hands. I told him how much more a white fighter was worth to me. Too bad there's no way to verify that. He said he had to pass it by his business manager. (Wheeler) Who? Gus or Christina? I don't ask. There would have been enough for everyone. When I heard Gabriel had left this earth, I cried like a baby. Yeah. That's touching. I didn't tell you because I didn't want Gus to find out. Gabriel was signing with gold? He called that night. He thought he'd finally get his shot. And Gabriel confided in you, not in his brother? He was afraid Peter would tell Gus. Why, because Peter's loyal to Gus? Gabriel was too. He wanted to tell Gus himself. He said Gus had to be protected. Peter had you. Gus was the only father Gabriel could count on. You and Gabriel were close. Yes. We told each other everything. Living in that house with three grown men. That would drive me crazy. Dirty dishes, socks on the floor. Well, I'm not a career woman like you. I like to take care of my family. So why'd you move out? There's not a lot of extra room in here. Is that where you sleep? Yeah. My sister, she needed me. [Phone rings] Excuse me. Hello. Hi. [Speaking Polish] She's on her way home. I should finish these clothes. So Gabriel and Christina kept the deal a secret. I wonder what else they kept from Peter? Hey, detective Mike Logan. Detective Wheeler. Well, if you need Christina, she's home. Actually, we were just inside. It must be a real godsend to have her here. Oh, three kids? The work never ends. That's why you asked her to come in? Oh, no, I never asked. I mean, we don't even have a room for her. She wanted to come, I didn't ask questions. So she came on her own. Did she tell you why? No. One day she just called out of the blue. Said she was coming. Gabriel, he helped her pack up and move in. Gabriel? Not Peter? Gabriel was such a sweetheart. He came over a lot. I think he had a little crush. Thank you. We checked Christina's phone records. She and Gabriel spoke every day. And her sister said that she and Gabriel were very close, physically affectionate, even holding hands. Look, it's his own brother. He's not gonna cheat on him. Keeping secrets, he helped her move. There was some kind of relationship. Peter the jealous type? Well, I see where this is going, and I'm telling you, no way. (Wheeler) Well, Logan, we know Peter has a temper. Well, his brother has just been murdered. You helped him with impulse control. Kid had a juvie record. What's in it? Uh, a couple of assaults. Kid stuff. He was a tough kid. How bad? Classmate ended up in the hospital. Everybody lived, okay? Was it over a girl? Gabriel was set up, okay? In my opinion, this is a crime of premeditation, not impulse. Sexual jealousy is a powerful emotion. All right. Well, then, let me talk to him. Why don't you sit this one out? Gabriel had a deal with gold? Nah. Christina would have told me. She and Gabriel were keeping secrets. Why did she move out, Peter? Her sister asked her. No, she didn't. Christina lived with you for four years. It was her house too. She suddenly moves out, you don't wonder why? I-I need to talk to her. Sit down, sit down. Now, what happened, Peter? Something she couldn't tell you about? Was she upset? Quiet with you? I don't know. (Ross) Sometimes things make sense when you think back. Looks between the two of them, a touch on the hand, a little jumpy when you walk in the room. (Wheeler) Your brother and your girl were lying to you, Peter. No. Your head must have been exploding. Mike told us about that boy in school. You beat him unconscious. I'm not like that anymore. (Ross) People don't change. You think I did something to Gabriel? Why weren't you with him that night? You set him up. You didn't want to be there to see him die. We got a hotel room. We... It was Christina's and my anniversary. We got a hotel r... You know what? Where's Mike? Hey, if you acted in a rage, we can help you. No, no. I want to talk to Mike. You back there? You don't think I did this, do you, Mike? (Ross) Your brother was lying to you, your girlfriend lying. Extenuating circumstances. Mike, I didn't do this! Okay, well, help yourself out. You don't know the real story, okay? So help us understand. There is no way Christina and Gabriel... Gabriel betrayed you. You snapped. Mike, you gotta believe me, okay? Hey! (Wheeler) Mike can't help you now, so you've gotta tell us the truth, Peter. Christina and Gabriel, no way. Gabriel didn't date girls. Gabriel didn't... like girls. Not that way. Your brother was gay? Shut your mouth! You don't understand. There are no gay boxers. You can't tell anybody. Mike! You gotta believe me. Mike, I didn't do this. Please. You gotta believe me. (Ross) Peter's right. There are no gay boxers. Except maybe Emil Griffith killed Benny paret in the ring. Paret called him a "maricon" at the weigh-in. There's no way Peter's making that story up. Well, it doesn't mean Gabriel and Christina weren't having an emotional affair. And she moved out of the house because of that? No, I don't think so. She's still hiding something from us, something she doesn't want Peter to know about. Then hold him. Let Christina think he's going down for the murder. Wait. Where are they taking Peter? We're processing him for Gabriel's murder. No, no, you're wrong. Sit. First of all, we already know you lied to Peter about why you moved out. I couldn't tell him. So you're having an affair with Gabriel. Peter finds out and kills him. Is that what you think? No. Gabriel was my friend. Peter may have believed differently. Why'd you move out of Kovak's? Your sister didn't ask you to move in. Hey, Peter is on the hook for murder, so you better stop lying right now. You can't tell Peter. Tell Peter what? You had a fight with Gus. What'd you fight about? Money? No. What? He was drunk. The boys were out. He said he couldn't stand it anymore, me in my nightgown. He raped you? No. He tried. He said if I told Peter, he wouldn't train him anymore. So you couldn't say anything, and you couldn't risk living there. I told Gabriel. I had to. He helped me move out. He promised me everything was going to work out all right. You can't tell Peter. Please, you can't tell him. Peter needs Gus. He can't make it without him. She's lying. Well, here's what I'm thinking. Gabriel found out what you were doing, and he was gonna tell Peter. Wait a minute. They're like my sons. Everything I did, I did for them. Molesting Christina? You know, that's not exactly how it happened. Well, something happened. Peter was too attached to her. He couldn't focus when she was around. So you drove her away. She softened him up, just like your partner did. What? Wait, I did what? You civilized him. Yeah, what do you mean? He had what it took, that's what I'm talking about, and you sat on him. That's the worst thing that can happen to a boxer. The kid was headed to jail, not to a title shot. Title shot. That's a big word. What the hell do you know about boxing, huh? You do that again, you're going right to jail. (Gus) What the hell do you know about boxing? (Logan) All right, step back, step back. What's the matter? You afraid you ain't got what it takes? If you touch me again, I will put your ass in jail! Do it! Do it! Hey, backup's on the way. It's all right, it's all right. Go ahead, call for backup. Scared to get your ass kicked in front of your girlfriend? (Logan) Let me tell you about you, Kovak. You're a bully. You didn't train him. You broke him down. I broke him down to build him back up. You and Gabriel took the fight out of him. That's why he couldn't close. You are truly out of your mind. You took away his killer instinct. I gave it back to him. You gotta live with that. Now that Gabriel's dead, Peter can go all the way. Heh! Honey, take your partner and get out of my gym. Christina hired a lawyer for Peter. He was released an hour ago. Do you remember Peter said that he and Christina stayed at a hotel the night of the murder? Well, she's got the first nickel he ever made. I wonder who paid for that room? That's good, but you gotta keep your hands up, okay? Boom, boom. Okay, two. Yo, Pete. What are you doing here? What, you don't think I remember this place? Coached him here for two years when he was younger. Are you following me? The lawyer said you didn't have nothing on me. How could you think I killed my brother, Mike? I don't think you killed your brother, Peter. You said the night that Gabriel was killed, you and Christina stayed at a hotel. Yeah. We needed some time alone. You pay for it? Uh-huh. Where'd you stay? I don't know. You know me with names. Well, it was your anniversary. Expensive place? Yeah, it was real nice. Uh, in Manhattan. I gotta get back to the kids. Christina's sister was right. The desk clerk confirms Christina and Peter stayed here the night of the murder. Who paid for the room? Gus Kovak, with a credit card. Two weeks in advance. Peter's still not answering his phone. I think he's on to us. (Logan, voiceover) I think he's on to us. Yeah, it was real nice. Uh, in Manhattan. I gotta get back to the kids. You helped him with impulse control. Your head must have been exploding. Mike told us about that boy in school. You beat him unconscious. You and Gabriel took the fight out of him. That's why he couldn't close. Couldn't close. Gabriel's manager Gus Kovak was buying rounds for the house. It's funny to get a champion after all these years. You took away his killer instinct. I gave it back to him. Now that Gabriel's dead, Peter can go all the way. You're embarrassing yourself! Think Gabriel would want you to run away like that in a fight? Now get back in there and show me the power. Show it to me. Show me what you got. Show me what you got! You're a puncher! Show me what your brother thought you had! That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. 10-56. I need a bus. Mike, I'm sorry. Pete, my god, what did you do? I needed the names, Mike. Of the guys he hired to kill Gabriel. I hit him. He wouldn't answer. I had to hit him again. (Peter) I got the names. I wrote 'em down. You should have called me. We had him. My whole life, I've been looking for my dad, you know? Looking to come home. You, Gus, you did what you could, but the one guy, all along, who looked out for me, was my brother. I didn't need a dad 'cause I had Gabriel. Poor Gus. You know the last thing he said? "You're gonna thank me." I gotta put these on you. I know, Mike. [Handcuffs clicking] I don't want you to worry about me, Mike. I'm okay now.
