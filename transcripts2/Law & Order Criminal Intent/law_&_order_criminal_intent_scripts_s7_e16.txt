 Let me get these. (Rhodes) So, Jordie, you been busy savin' the world these last few years. Yeah, I've been given so much. I'm just tryin' to give back. I know, and you really have, man. You've done so much. I noticed every little bit. (Jordie) Thank you. (Rhodes) But we're here tonight to talk about your new CD and the reunion tour with twisted strands. The guys are really kickin', man. And we got a new guitarist. Anybody I know? Well, as a matter of fact... Come on out. Yo, mom. Milo? My son is your guitarist? Mom, pick up the phone. Pick up! (Jordie) Chill. I'll take good care of him. Mom, pick up the phone! My friends, we been through a lot. But you know what I say. When life hits you with crap, hit back and rock on. I'll see you next week. Sylvia Rhodes. Rock n' roll promoter. Hosted a late night public access show. New York City icon. (Logan) She lived alone? (Campest) mm-hmm. (Logan) Who found the body? Her son, Milo. $4 million Tribeca loft. No doorman. No surveillance video. (Wheeler) neighbors hear anything? Great. It looks like she was workin' from home. VCR? I didn't know they still had these things. Any signs of a robbery? There were footprints from her son's sneakers. (Wheeler) No forced entry? Wallet with cards and cash in her purse. Jewelry, silver untouched. Okay, it feels like she was hit with one of our favorites and that would be the heavy blunt instrument. Any ideas, Wheeler? She was probably standing here opening the champagne. The foil's off. The wire's loose. Gets hit in the back of the head. Yeah, she polished off the first bottle. Was going for the second. Yeah, foil, wire, cork. And no bottle. Maybe the first bottle was used as a murder weapon, and the killer took it with him. Campesi, where's her son? At the neighbors'. Some rock and roll couple. Jordie and Tara Black. The Jordie Black, lead singer of twisted strands? (Campest) He's got gold records on the wall and a wife in a black bustier. What are you, a fan, Wheeler? (Wheeler) You're not? Sightless in a savage land. I had all their albums in high school. Ooh. I came by this morning. Brought mom her favorite bialys. She didn't answer, so I let myself in. She was just lyin' there. I stepped in her blood. Here, Milo, drink this. You don't live with your mother, but you still have keys? I moved out, like, a year ago. Anybody else have a set of keys? Her assistant, uh... Joanne? Ava. (Milo) Mom burned through a lot of 'em. She probably used a temp agency, right? When was the last time you saw your mother alive? Taped her cable show two days ago. Jordie. (Tara) These are detectives Logan and Wheeler. Jordie Black. We know. So you were in bed asleep when Milo found the body? We both were. This is horrible. Sylvia was a real friend. How long have you lived next door? (Jordie) Three years. Yeah. But we go way back. She was the promoter of our first days on the green. When you opened for blue oyster cult. That's gotta be before your time. [Milo sobbing] You all right, buddy? I can't believe this. After everything she lived through. She lived through a plane crash when I was, like, three years old. Dad died. Everyone else. She was the only one who walked out alive. I just thought she'd live forever. So, Rodgers, she got her head bashed in? In layman's terms. I put time of death, between 10:00 and midnight. And, yes, it could've been a champagne bottle. How drunk was she? Very. .17 not that I'd blame her. She's been through hell. Chemo, radiation, a lobectomy of the left lung. I'd say lung cancer. Tough lady. I recognize her from TV. She used to have a public access show. Rock 'n' talk. It aired the night she died. Huh. Thought I’d walk this over. Captain. Temp agency located Sylvia's assistant, Ava Reese. Ava isn't here. She probably needed to get away for the weekend. You know where she went? No. Did something happen to her? We just wanna make sure she's all right. Is this about her boss, Sylvia? I saw it on the news. It's awful. Ava is such a bad luck magnet. You mind if I just take a look around here? Oh, uh, sure. (Wheeler) This your place? (Chia) Yeah, I'm on the lease, but roommates are allowed. (Wheeler) And Ava's bad luck. She have trouble paying rent? (Chia) She tries to. But last month her dad lost a kidney, and then her boyfriend Ralph was killed by a truck. So you sleep on the couch, and Ava gets the bedroom? Oh, it's not so bad. The bedroom's really small. I'm gonna take a little peek in here, okay? Oh, okay. This bureau yours or Ava's? Oh, it's mine, but she uses it. Oh. I'm gonna take a look in the drawer, all right? We're just worried about her safety. I respect Ava's privacy. But sometimes I take the bed on weekends. When she's away? (Wheeler) you know where she goes? (Chia) Atlantic city, Philly. Look at this. Is this your roommate? Yeah. But I don't understand. It's her picture with my name. So Sylvia's assistant is a bad roommate and a con artist? With a history of identity theft. Her real name is Bianca Lopez. Her first offense, she got time served. Okay, and the boyfriend who was supposedly killed by a truck... Ralph Cenzio... Just got outta Rikers last week. Missing grifter with an ex-con boyfriend and a dead boss. You said Sylvia's credit cards were in her wallet. This girl's a pro. She figured if she took just one, nobody would notice. Thanks. Oh, and don't forget the gas. Here we go. A check for 10 grand cashed this afternoon. Credit card charges starting later. Car rental, liquor store, Victoria's secret, gas station. Oh, yeah, Hackensack, Parsippany, Stanhope. All on the 80 west. What are you doin' tonight? Skype session with my fiance. A what? Video call. He's still in London. Well, he'll have to start without you. Road trip, Wheeler. Poconos, baby. [Giggles] Miss Lopez, NYPD. We wanna talk to you. Put it in. Go, go. Go, go, go, go! Police! Nobody move! Bianca Lopez, Ralph Cenzio, get dressed, you're under arrest. What the hell? We didn't do anything. For a dead guy, you look pretty healthy. We didn't do anything. (Logan) come on, let's go, folks. Party's over. Up, let's go! Get dressed. Okay, so I used Sylvia's credit card. It was like a loan. How'd you get the card? She gave it to me a couple of weeks ago. Uh-huh. Then why'd we find your fingerprints all over Sylvia's wallet? I'm her assistant. I go through her stuff a lot. All right, so what happened, Bianca? Sylvia found out that you were on the con, she threatened to call the police, and then you killed her? It wasn't me. Sylvia's phone records show that the last person she called was you. Lady was damn lonely. She bugged me all the time. So after she called you on Friday, is that when you went over to her apartment? And before you tell us yet another lie, your little ugly boyfriend, Ralph? He already told us that you were there. Ralph's a liar and a skank. Could be. But we have his signed statement, and that's all a jury needs. And you won't exactly do time served for murder. Oh, no, you're gonna do the whole sentence, honey. 25 to life. Okay, Sylvia asked me to set her VCR for her stupid show. So I went over, but she was already dead. So you just decided to take advantage of the situation and go through her wallet. That bitch owed me. What time did you get there? I don't know. 12:30? Sylvia called at 9:45. It took you almost three hours? I ignored her message. I was with Ralph getting tats. Now I gotta get this removed. Look, I didn't kill her. Yeah, but you don't seem too sorry that she's dead. Yeah, well, I'm not the only one. Her son hated her too. He told you that? He didn't have to. She'd always want him to come over, but he'd always be next door. With Jordie and Tara Black? Yeah. They fought about it all the time. You know, Milo was with Sylvia Friday night. Why don't you ask him? Maybe he killed her. How do you know they were together? I made the reservation. Toniolo's. Bianca's tattoo parlor just confirmed her alibi. She was there past midnight. Rodgers puts time of death before 12:00. Let her stew in holding until the D.A. sorts out the charges. She may not be a killer, but she's a thief and a liar. She didn't lie about Milo. The maître d'" at Toniolo's confirms" he and Sylvia had dinner Friday night. I served Sylvia many years. When she had the chemo, I sent over ravioli with butter and sage. La sua morte mi ha spezzato il cuore. Her dying broke your heart. Si. Bella Donna. We heard she was here Friday night with her son? It's a pity. Wonderful woman got stuck with that boy. He's mal educato. Well, Milo seemed pretty shaken by her death. It's too late. He lived off her money and treated her like garbage. My child talked to me like that... You heard him raise his voice? Right before dessert, she puts a paper on the table. He screams like a crazy idiot, throws it at her, and walks out. What were they arguing about? All I know, Sylvia was upset. I gave her a nice glass of lemony Prosecco to calm her down. What time did Sylvia leave the restaurant? 9:30? The receipt would show. Should I get it? Please. It's funny how Milo didn't mention their last supper. Yeah, wonder what else he didn't mention. Milo, NYPD. Well, kid could be a danger to himself, right? Hello? Milo? Anyone in here? Renovated condo on Stanton. Thanks, mom. It looks like she may have cut him off. Overdrawn accounts, collection notices. Milo hasn't paid a bill for months. That's 'cause he's too busy gettin' high. Kid had the fun-time pharmacy. Hey, and something in common with you, Wheeler. He's a fan of Jordie Black. [Noise from the bedroom] That door was open a minute ago. Hey, Milo, you in there? Don't shoot, don't shoot. I'm a lawyer. Don't tempt me. Get outta there. Bo Levy, family attorney. You have a search warrant for the premises? Do you? I don't need one, I have keys. Oh, does Milo know that? Kid's not here. And you didn't try to hide his meds. So what were you lookin' for? I was checking up on him. Concerned after the death of his mother. A nice young man, but in and out of rehab. A bit unstable. So you were goin' through his closet after his mother was murdered? Tampering with evidence, is that a felony or a misdemeanor, Wheeler? Felony. I didn't tamper with anything. Come on, let's go. The tombs are nice and ripe right now. Not to violate client confidentiality, but I was looking for some recently revised legal documents. Legal documents, like a will? The one Sylvia showed Milo Friday night? You found it? Is it signed? What, did Sylvia get tired of funding Milo's drug habit and find herself a new beneficiary? Yeah. I need that to protect my client's final wishes. We don't have it. But at least we now know what we're all lookin' for. After you, counselor. We'll lock up. Go ahead. Milo's cell still goes straight to voice mail. Let's go back to Sylvia's loft. If we can't find the will, that means Milo did. What do you mean you can't meet me? I need a fix. No, I don't wanna wait. I don't care. Anything? Bar receipts from Max's Kansas City. Hey, you know, that used to be a happenin' place. It's an expression. Groovy. I don't think she's thrown away a piece of paper since 1972. Hey, Bo didn't lie. Hand delivered on Friday from his firm. Empty. So Sylvia takes a copy with her to dinner, shows it to Milo. He throws it in her face. She takes it... (Jordie) Help! Help! We found Milo passed out in the hall. We called 911! They're on the way! Can anyone do CPR? See if he's breathing. Come on, baby. Milo! Milo! Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Temazepam, Zolpidem. Multiple doctors and multiple pharmacies. The kid worked the system. You think he was trying to kill himself? I think it was just stupid. So he'll recover? His liver enzymes are through the roof. We'll need to keep him under observation until he stabilizes. Other than that, he'll live... this time. This time. Suicide? No. Look, I was upset. About my mom and stuff. It must be hard. The last time you saw her at dinner you had a big fight? Yeah, the whole restaurant heard. Look, I shoulda said somethin'. I thought it'd look bad. It does look bad. After dinner where'd you go? Home. Alone? Yeah. So we can't verify. Wait, are you sayin' I'm a suspect now? That's whack, dude. My mom was high-strung, and I'm obviously not the perfect son. So we fought, yeah. But I'm lost without her. I'm like an orphan now. A rich orphan. We know your mom changed her will. She wasn't gonna do that. Not for real. She didn't even sign it. Are you sure about that? Yes. Look, when I found her in the morning, the will was lying on her desk. So I took it. It was stupid. I was a little high. We want that will. Is this comin' from my mom's lawyer? Don't believe a word that dirt bag says. He claims he's looking out for you. Bo looks out for Bo. He's been stealin' from my mom for years. I told her that Friday night. You think it was my mom's idea to change the will? If she'd have signed that, Bo's cut was huge. The kid admits he stole an unsigned will off his dead mother's desk, and he's making me the bad guy? All I did was follow Sylvia's request. We read the changes. You set it up so Milo couldn't touch his trust until he was 40 years old, and you're the sole trustee. That way he couldn't swallow or snort the whole estate. It's common. Is it also common for the lawyer/trustee to charge 10% a year? Perfectly legal. Where were you Friday night? I was in alpine, New Jersey, bailing out a client. Can't say who. Hey, Bo, buy me this one. Okay, sweetie, I'll be right there. Look, changing the will wasn't my idea. It was all on Sylvia. The day before she died, Thursday, she called me, ranting, saying she had to stop Milo. Stop him from doing what, drugs? (Levy) Go easy, honey. Milo was ruining his life. She had to cut him off to save him. That's all Sylvia kept saying. I have to deal with my client. Thursday. That was the day Sylvia taped her last show. With Milo and Jordie Black as her guests. So we're here tonight to talk about your new cd and the reunion tour with twisted strands. (Jordie) The guys are really kickin', man. And we got a new guitarist. Anybody I know? Well, as a matter of fact... Come on out! Yo, mom. Milo? My son is your guitarist? Sit on down. That look... It's how I felt when my oldest told me he wanted to live with his mother. Check this out. [Fast-forwarding] Go on tour with Jordie Black? Yeah, it's, like... ma, it's like my dream come true. It's a hell of a way to let me know, fellas. Don't worry, Syl. I'll take good care of him. Right? yeah. She didn't want this guy anywhere near her son, much less goin' on tour with him. What do we know about Jordie other than he once was famous for playing guitar and abusing drugs? Well, Jordie's cleaned up the last few years. Cleaned up? What'd he used to look like? He works hard. He contributes to causes. That doesn't explain Sylvia's reaction. There must've been somethin' else she knew about him. That got her killed. Talk to Jordie and Tara separately. She's been the wife of a rock star for 20 years. She could write a book. I'll talk to the wife. Let's make Wheeler's day and let her talk to Jordie. [Mellow rock music] ? ♪ Look to the east ?to find your brother ?look to the west ?to help one another ?open your doors ?the need is everywhere he hasn't partied in years. Well, Sylvia knew Jordie was sober. Maybe she was worried about Milo's drug use. Jordie was really trying to help. Milo could be a handful. I can't imagine raising a teenage boy. No father. So you two never had kids, huh? Jordie Black getting up at 5:00 A.M. with a screaming baby? I don't think so. Besides, he still needs to be taken care of himself. And you do that for him? Yes, I do. For 20 years, since we met backstage. Then I'd say your husband's a lucky man. Aw, well, I've been on the road with him for a long time. And kids just don't fit our lifestyle. Well, it looks like Jordie found time for Milo. Milo really looks up to you. He has posters of you up in his apartment. Does he? And Sylvia knew you were an influence on him. Maybe she didn't trust that you were really clean? Well, in the old days I probably hurt her like I hurt all my friends. It's a blur, you know? I'm just tryin' to make amends, you know? Jordie's completely committed to his sobriety. His only vices now are his double espressos and his cigs. Black Shag Tobacco. He buys it in London. Long way to go for a smoke. Jordie would travel the world for his drugs. Amsterdam, Colombia, Thailand for smack. His last trip to Thailand? He was the spokesman for S.A.Y.F.E... Sparing all youth from exploitation. Now instead of scoring dope in Bangkok, he's saving children's lives. ?we are one child ?we are one life ♪we're in this time♪ ?to make it right ?we are one child ? He's clean, sober, very open about his past. He's all about redemption. Scratch a preacher. Find a sinner. And the vice they rail against the loudest. What group did you say he was spokesman for? S.A.Y.F.E., an organization that protects children from abuse by adults. And Sylvia didn't want him around her son? Come on, that's not what this is about. I worked with Bernie Kerik, Eliot Spitzer. If I was wrong about them, you could be wrong about Jordie. Find out why he's so involved in this cause. Jordie Black was a dedicated advocate for exploited children around the world. We appreciated his service. Excuse me, was a dedicated advocate? He stepped down three months ago. After his trip to Thailand? There was no mention of that in the press. When we find a replacement, we'll make an announcement. Wait a minute, I mean, he just stepped down? That seems strange. I mean, from what we heard, he was very dedicated to this organization. It was a mutual decision with the board. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. Well, you can be of more help, actually. Because these little phrases, "step down", "mutual decision"... I mean, that's all code for damage control. So what you need to do is tell us right now what Jordie did. No charges were filed. I'm sure the board wants to keep this misunderstanding private to protect the girl. Girl? It was boys. Teenagers. As you can imagine, we had no choice. We had to relieve Mr. Black of his spokesman duties. Wow. There. Are you feeling all right? Yeah, it's just... I'm a little tired. Yeah, I bet you are. You just lie down, and I'll take care of you. Jordie Black was held by Bangkok police for four days on an expired visa? Seems extreme. Well, that was the official reason. And unofficially? You wanna tell him? Or are you still his biggest fan, Wheeler? According to the state department, Jordie had two teenage boys in his hotel room. He was making a videotape, asking sexual questions. And no charges were filed? Not after Bo Levy flew to Thailand and fixed it. That's confirmed by the state also. Bo Levy, Sylvia's lawyer? Yep, that guy pops up everywhere. Okay. So Jordie has a thing for teenage boys. Doing the math, we infer that he was having an inappropriate relationship with Milo, and somehow Sylvia found out. (Logan) Right. Jordie tells her that he's takin' Milo on tour. She confronts him, threatens to expose him. He snaps, bing, bang, she's dead. There are some leaps here. Wheeler, he got clean. He got sober. But then he found a new vice. Teenage boys. So it goes. (Ross) Milo still in the hospital? (Logan) nope, released last night. If they do have a relationship, Milo will do everything he can to protect Jordie. Tread carefully. Been clean since I got home. Just practicin'. Stayin' outta trouble. How'd you get home last night? Jordie picked me up. (Wheeler) he sounds like a good friend. You two spend a lotta time together? Gives me guitar lessons, yeah. You got a lotta guitars in here. You mind if I take a look at 'em? Sure. Acoustic and electric. You two play together? Yeah, we jam. Sometimes Jordie sings. We're gettin' ready for the tour. What does this have to do with my mom? Well, we think your mother may have been worried about you and Jordie. Look, my mom didn't really like most of what I did. It's just always how we were. Black Shag Tobacco. Look, I know I shouldn't smoke. Let's take it one vice at a time, shall we? Where do you get this? Anywhere. No, Milo, you gotta go to London to get that. Whose are these? Look, some girl left 'em here. I don't see any lipstick marks. What's her name? Don't remember. It's okay, Milo. I think we know who smokes Black Shag. Okay. They're Jordie's. Did he leave them when he dropped you off last night? Must have. Under the bed? You want to tell us what's been going on? Look, I'm not gay, I just... I'm not gay. Those photos are from Milo's MySpace page. He sent me the link. Yeah, he told us. Now, some of these photos are of Milo when he was 12. 13. It's not what you think. These pictures, they're bookmarked on your computer for easy access. I'm confused. Why are you looking at half-naked pictures of your neighbor's kid? Detectives, my client is here of his own accord, willing to cooperate. After we got a warrant for his laptop. Found pictures of young boys. Those photos are for publicity. Milo's going on tour. There are t-shirts, posters... What about these photos? I was doing research for a rock opera about abused children. In their bathing suits? They're kids! The hotel had a pool. What exactly is your relationship with Milo? I'm a mentor to him. And I told you that. In the bedroom? (Levy) detective, you're out of line. You know what, counselor? I liked you better when you were in the closet. Let's get to business. Friday night, where were you, what were you doing? I was home watching Sylvia's show. And before that? I was out with my N.A. sponsee. We'll need a name. I can't give you that. That's what the "a" is for. Anonymous. We'll need a name. I didn't kill Sylvia. She was a good friend to me and Tara. I don't know who my husband's sponsee is. Jordie takes the program very seriously. So he could've been lying about who he was with, where he was? No, no way. That's the old Jordie. Not anymore. You know, I don't understand. Why can't I see him? Are you arresting him for something? (Wheeler) We'd like to. We can't confirm his alibi for Friday night. An alibi? What, for Sylvia's murder? Why would he murder Sylvia? You don't know? About Jordie and Milo? [Sighs] What are you talking about? Well, let's just say that Jordie was a hands-on mentor to Milo. [Gasps] Did Milo tell you that? He's lying. Why would he do that? Because I think he killed his mother. What? Okay, look. I lied before. We like Milo. I was trying to protect him. But, you know, in our building you can hear everything that goes on next door. And the night Sylvia was killed? Sylvia and Milo were fighting. I couldn't hear every single thing they were saying. But Milo was screaming. He was furious. And then I heard a crash and then just the TV. What time did this all happen? Well, it was while Jordie was out. So around 10:30. Why would I kill my mother? All I ever wanted was her approval. And now I'll never get that. We have a witness who says you killed her. What, they were in the apartment with me? They're lying. You know what, I have to go, okay? I'm scattering my mother's ashes in an hour. You have to let me do that. Milo. Were you and Sylvia arguing about your relationship with Jordie? I'm not gay. Why did Jordie want you to go on tour with him? Promised I wouldn't say. You try to protect Jordie, and you're goin' down for murder. It's as simple as that. Truth is, he can't play. He's got somethin' wrong with his hands. All the drugs. How bad? Can barely make a grip. Can't even light a match. (Milo) But you can't let anyone know. So there's no way he was rolling those cigarettes for himself. Did you roll them for him, Milo? No, look, it's not like that. So the tobacco and rolling papers were... Tara's? You weren't sleeping with Jordie. You were sleeping with Tara. Don't tell Jordie. Please. I only let you think the cigarette butts were his 'cause of Tara and I. No one can know about that. But your mother found out. She tried to make me stop it. Said she'd cut me out of the will. I said no. Tara and I are in love. This just came in from Jordie's manager. A score and libretto of his rock opera. It's about an abused boy. So Jordie was telling the truth about the kids in Thailand and about Milo. My apologies, Wheeler. We still don't know what happened. Tara was having an affair with Milo. How does Sylvia end up dead? Yeah, Sylvia, she's a real piece of work, and she was drunk. She might've threatened to tell Jordie about the affair. (Ross) So who killed Sylvia? Tara, Milo, or Jordie when he found out? (Logan) if he found out. Tara has no life without Jordie Black. He disappears, she doesn't exist. Let the kid go scatter his mother's ashes. Jordie and Tara will be there. Makes it a good time to find out what Jordie knew. (Milo) My mother deserved a much longer life and a more loving son. I'm gonna try and be that son from now on. Hang in there, Milo. Okay, Milo, the ashes are scattered. We've gotta take you back. Detectives, give the kid a break. He'd never hurt his mom. That's not what your wife told us. What's he talkin' about? She gave Milo up. She said she heard him through the wall screaming at Sylvia before Sylvia was killed. She was dead when I got there. Why are you saying that? Tara. I should've told you, I'm sorry. Let's let them take care of this, baby. This is not our business anymore. This is crazy. I'll get you a lawyer. We'll get this straightened out. Just so you know, if Milo's lawyer is smart, he'll use your affair with him as part of the defense. There is no affair. I told them that. No affair? We found Black Shag Tobacco and rolled cigarette butts at Milo's. Not mine you didn't. (Wheeler) don't you roll your own? So if someone was hand-rolling cigarettes at Milo's and it wasn't you, it was your wife? I may have gone to Milo's once or twice. I may have rolled a cigarette. (Logan) In his bed? 'Cause we found the rolled cigarette butts under the bed. Milo, tell them they're wrong. I'm sorry. They made me... They made me tell them. Your wife is sleeping with your protege. He's a kid. How could you do this to me? Baby, it was a mistake. It was a mistake. Why? To get back at me? No, not to get back at you. No, I wanted you to look at me... to see me. I thought if I slept with Milo, that I'd feel sexy again, that you would want me, that you would notice me. So you betrayed me? No, I didn't betray you. All I've ever wanted was you... you! I gave up everything. Everything... I gave up my life, having kids, everything. Does that sound right, Jordie? It was mutual. Mutual? Yeah. I had an abortion for you 19 years ago because Sylvia told me it was the only way I could keep you. That's enough. And when I was crying on Sylvia's shoulder, she had a little secret of her own. Tara, stop! Didn't she? (Jordie) Tara, stop. And then you wanted to live next door to him. That's enough! I betrayed you? What did you and Sylvia do to me? Shut up! (Wheeler) Hey, hey! Shut up now! Hey, take your hands off your wife right now. You had a son with Sylvia, and you never told me. You never told me! What, were you two laughing at me the whole time all these years? I'm sorry, Milo. Your mom didn't want you to know. I don't understand. Someone wanna tell him? I want to tell him. They've been lying to you, to everyone. To you, to me. Let me introduce you to your father, because he didn't have the guts to tell you himself. And Sylvia finally told you the truth on Friday night, didn't she? She came over. She was angry and drunk, as usual. She needed help with the VCR. So I went over there. Then she confronted you about the affair. I told her I was gonna end it with Milo. But you know Sylvia. She wouldn't let it go. She kept going at me. She kept going at me. She said I was such an idiot. I was such an idiot that I didn't even know I was sleeping with my own stepson. And so... and so she kept drinking, and she... she wouldn't shut up. She just wouldn't shut up. And then you picked up the bottle, and you hit her. I... she... Tara. She took my whole life from me.
