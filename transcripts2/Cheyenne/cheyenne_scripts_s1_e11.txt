 Jeffry Billings? No. Somebody looking for Jeffry Billings? I am. Cheyenne Bodie. Well, at your service. Uh, pardon my glove. I must say, uh, you haven't wasted much time getting here. I figure the sooner we get started, the sooner you'll be able to get settled up there. I take it you've been up to Owl River country before. You'll be able to find your way and that sort of thing.

 We'll manage to stumble across it somehow. Excuse me. Did I hear you say you're going up the Owl River? Yes, that's right. Well, I'm Frank Endicott. And my mother- Well, that is, my mother and I own a ranch up there. Oh, always glad to meet a neighbor. Rather a long way from home, aren't you? Do you always come this far to take a bath, eh? I came down to pick up my fianc?e. Oh, you're to be congratulated. The point I wanted to make is, is long as we're all going up the Owl River,

 it might be safer if we went up there together. Safer? Comanches are out. They're taking scalps. Is that right, Bodie? That's what they say. I think he's got a good idea. All right. Glad to have you with us. We'll be leaving in an hour. Good. Stage is coming, Frank. Well, we'll meet you then. At the fork, west of town. Righto. Well, those Indians have certainly got him trembling in his boots. I reckon that's your bride-to-be. Well, she's no prizewinner. What did you expect? She looks right nice. I thought she was supposed to be young. She's 30 if she's a day. Frank, when you get to be my age, you'll realize a woman ain't a woman until she's 30. Miss McIntyre? You're Frank. That's right. This is John Pike, my mother's foreman. How do you do? Howdy, ma'am. Your mother, is she here too? Well, it's a pretty long trip, and she's not getting any younger. I'll get the rig. Can't tell you what a thrill it is to meet my glamorous second cousin after hearing about him all my life. It's a lovely engagement ring you sent me. Yeah. Ma picked that out... from a catalog. Oh. Got everything, Beef? All set. Here they come, sir. Well, are we all ready? Yes, sir. Any time you say. Good. Oh, my dear, I'd like you to meet Mr. Bodie, our guide. Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Billings. I feel a great deal safer already. My dear, you couldn't be safer if you were in St. Paul's. Shall we? Frank Endicott's party joined us on the outskirts of the town. And three days later, we were at the edge of Comanche country. Bodie? How far do you think we've gone today? Not too far to turn back. I've been listening to the lady cough all day. It's none of my business but, if I were you, I'd forget the Owl River. Is that so? You a doctor, then? Just a guide. But I know what it takes to pioneer this country. A woman's got to be as strong as a man to survive out here. I suggest you let me worry about that. You're paying the freight. Besides, my wife wouldn't even consider returning to London. You don't realize what you've got here. While the whole world's going to Hades in a bucket, here a man can live the way men were intended to live. This is the last frontier. You'll have to forgive me, but it happens to be my pet subject. Now, uh... how many miles do you estimate we've gone today? Twenty? I'd say closer to 15. Thanks. On the seventh day, the axle broke on the Endicott buckboard. And later the same day, some hungry buzzards led us to a dying saddle pony. What's wrong? I'll have to shoot him. Broken leg? No, somebody just plain ran him to death. Hello, where did you pop from? Oh, it's a little hard to say. I was lost. It's lucky for me you come along though, wasn't it? I sure do hope you take another passenger. Why certainly. We couldn't possibly leave you stranded out here. That your horse? No, sir, I carry this saddle around with me all the time. If he's your horse, how come you didn't put him out of his suffering? Well, you see, I saw these Indian signs. Lots of them. I just didn't feel free to waste the bullet. Well, put your saddle in the wagon, and you can ride in front. Oh, incidentally, my name is Billings. I sure do thank you, Mr. Billings. Found some pony tracks up ahead I don't like the looks of. There's an old, abandoned way station about a quarter mile up the road. We'll head for it. At least you'll have some cover while I look around. Mr. Bodie, back there! Bear left at the fork. Hyah! What happened to Billings? Billings! The wagon! They're gone. I wouldn't count on it. There's some out at the wagon, a couple of more behind those rocks out past that quicksand. Anybody like to say anything? Uh- I guess he was the closest thing to a father I ever had. I'm sorry, John. Hey, cut it short, will you? Amen. I expect you're wondering why I didn't stop at the wagon. Well... The old boy bolted with me. He had the bit in his teeth. Wouldn't stop for love nor money. It's the first time he's ever- Let me see it. Tsk. You badly hurt? Oh, he's lost two or three drops of blood at least. I wasn't talking to you. It hurt? Some. So bad. Have it fixed up in a minute. Just as good as new. Can't you go someplace else? Remind me to tell you about yourself sometime. We'll have this fixed up right away. You certainly run him off. Sure reminded me of Ma. I remember once, we had this ranch hand. And he got hold of some whiskey, and he got drunk. Ma gave him a tongue-lashing that almost took hide off of him. He lit out. And... didn't even stop to get his pay. Sure reminded me of her. Take that as a compliment. Our side of the family thinks highly of your- Your mother. That better? Feels fine. I wonder if you'd get me that canteen? Oh. Surely. What's the matter? I think it's empty. Empty? Looks like we might be here for a while. So maybe we better get some kind of a system set up. I guess we better have two men on guard all the time, starting now. You and Beef will take first guard. We will? Any objections? Yeah, now that you mention it. Like what? Oh, like I don't remember anybody, uh... electing you general. Somebody's got to run it. That's right. And Bodie's the best man. I wouldn't be too sure about who's best man. You know who I am? Call you the Utah Kid. They say you killed some men in barrooms. That doesn't make you an Indian fighter. Hello, dead man. You're fast. But I hired out as guide to this party. That makes me more or less responsible. Put that gun away. You heard what he said. You're the general. But don't ever forget which one of us is best man. Thanks. Don't mention it, governor. It would have been me pleasure to have blown his brains out. Providing, of course, he has any. Do you think they'll attack? It's hard telling. No reason why they should. We can't last more than four or five days without food and water. All they've got to do is wait us out. Lavinia? Lavinia? Couple of them out by the wagon, pretending to be coyotes. Another one behind them rocks. Well, you better get some sleep. I'll take over. You want to get the chill out of your bones, I got a little fire going in there. Good night. Room for another? Why, sure. Make yourself right at home. Feels good. I could toast myself like a muffin. It'll be dawn soon. What's your watch say? Oh, I don't have a watch. Huh. That's my timepiece. I study 'em some. Can call most a hundred by name. Strange for a wagon driver, isn't it? Yeah. It helps though. Like there. That's the North Star. When we get out of this place, why, I'll be following that star right back to where I live. Where are you from? Work at a homestead. Valley of the Sweetwater... in Wyoming country. It's nice. You know, pretty. Nice grazing too. Most everything a man would want. Sounds wonderful. Valley of the Sweetwater. I can't see why you'd ever want to leave a place with a name like that. Well, sometimes it gets kind of lonesome by myself. So I go and take a job for a while. I always come back. There's no reason to be lonesome, a man like you. Well, I've never had much luck when it comes to finding somebody. You know, a man gets said no to just so often. Then it hits him. He ain't exactly catnip to the ladies. Oh, I know. Back home... I used to sit and... watch the people walking hand in hand. I used to think to myself, "Everybody but me has somebody." But I never gave up hope. You see what happened? I found Frank. Yeah. Well... I think I'll turn in. Night. Come out. Die. Don't shoot. They'd like us to waste what few bullets we've got. Come out. Fight us. Never saw an Injun carry on like that before. Indians are like anybody else. You got the quiet ones. You've got the showoffs, like Pretty Feathers there. You ladies will excuse us. I think it's about time the rest of us had a council. Will you kindly keep watch in there? I guess we all know where we stand. They've got food and water. They can wait us out. If anybody's got a piece to speak, now's the time. Begging your pardon. Go ahead. Well, like you say, they've got food and drink. But we've got Kelly Lad. It's my thought a man could ride for help. The odds are 100-1 against making it. You've never seen him run. He's fast as the wind. It's not just a case of speed. We're surrounded. Won't be easy to break through. But what's the alternative? Starvation, torture. And what about the women? All right, we'll try it, tonight. Early, before moonrise. But, like I said, it won't be any church social. I'd like to have a shot at it. I say we draw for it. High card goes. All right. If that's agreeable with everybody. Cut. Eight. Seven. Your turn, sir. Deuce. Queen. There's a woman in your life. King. Trouble from the dark-haired man. Well, now, what do you know? The long journey. Godspeed. Good luck. Thank you, sir. All set? Hyah! Hyah! I think he's made it. I hope so. Think I heard something just outside. I'm gonna take a look around. Cover me, huh? Sure. Hair looks right pretty when it's down like that. It's an awful waste. What is? Are you really gonna marry that feller? See where that's any of your business. I know something about ya. What? Oh, that fella ain't gonna make you happy. Aren't you supposed to be on watch? Get out of here. Well, you don't want me to leave, do you? You see, I told you I knew something about ya. Well, you walk around here like a Sunday school teacher, don't you? So cool, butter wouldn't melt in your mouth? But I know what's going on inside that head of yours. Do you want me to put it in words for you? I don't have to listen to this. I ain't gonna tell nobody. It's just between you and me. Will you get out of here?! Mm. Mm. Take your filthy hands off of her. Don't you know enough to stay out of places you ain't wanted? I ought to splatter you against that wall. That gun makes you a big man, don't it? Put it away, Kid. Do you think this gun's the difference between you and me? Do you? Here, you got the gun. You see. You're mush inside. That's the difference. He's mush inside. That's the difference. Takes guts to kill a man. Bodie. We should take a look out there. Not a trace of them. Do you think they've gone? Nope. They're out there, waiting. For what? Somebody to do something stupid. Sure quiet. Yeah. Look. I plugged the canteen. I'd be willing to take a chance at the water hole. Nope. You wouldn't look too good without your hair. See? Where are the Indians? Indians, where? There's nobody out there. We're in here dying of thirst! And there ain't an Indian in 40 miles of this place! Frank, please! You keep your hands off of me. If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't be here in the first place. Your fault. An old maid who couldn't get herself a husband. What did you have to pick on me for?! I'm sorry. Forget it. We kill buffalo. You hungry? Ella? Ella, I'm sorry. It's all right, Frank. Could you forget what I said? It's not your fault. Everything is just the same then? No, I'm... afraid not. Oh. Ma picked that out herself. Maybe that's the trouble. Oh. You- You'll change your mind, Ella. When you meet Ma and see the ranch. I'm not gonna see your ranch. Not gonna meet your mother. If I get out of here, I'm going home. Much as I want a home and a family of my own... I can't marry you. Oh, why not, Ella? Why not? I think one mother's enough for you. I'd be a little careful about showing myself if I were you, ma'am. Thank you. I guess I was daydreaming. Suppose you can daydream at night. I do, more often than not. You do? Sure. You know, it's funny, but I'll bet we're quite a bit alike in lots of ways. I believe we might be. It's none of my business, but... are you gonna marry Frank? No. Well, do you think it's bad when two people are quite a bit alike? I mean, do you think two people like that could get along together? I think they might find it easier than most. You really think so? You can turn in now, Beef. I'll take over. Right. I certainly did enjoy our conversation, ma'am. Good night. Cheyenne. Cheyenne! Anybody got a piece of white cloth? Think it's about time me and Pretty Feathers had a talk. Ain't that taking a big chance? What good will it do? It's better than doing nothing. What can we lose? He's got a pretty fair opinion of himself. I just might be able to euchre him into something. Is this all right? Thank you, ma'am. Hold that gun out here. How much chance do you think we've got, Jeffry? Well, I- You can tell me. I'm not afraid of the truth. No. No, I realize that now. Seems I've always been the one who was frightened of the truth. Thing is, Lavinia... I owe you an apology. There's no need for it. Look, this may be the last opportunity I have of talking to you like this, and... Well, I... I'm gonna make a speech. The thing is, I- I've taken a rather good look at myself in these past few days, and I'm- I'm not very fond of what I see. Stubborn and selfish. Cowardly, thoughtless. I've been so busy pretending to be something I'm not, I haven't had time for the most important- Jeffry- Please, darling. The most important and... beloved thing of my life. You. Oh, what a pity we had to come to this godforsaken place before I discovered it. That's the end of my... My little speech, darling. I think it's a beautiful little speech. I am Chief Yellow Knife... of Comanche Nation. Comanche? Comanche. Oh, yes. The coyote people that live off the leavings of other tribes. They say your squaws do your fighting for you. Don't see any now. But then maybe you didn't come here to fight. Maybe... you die. I was raised by the Cheyenne. In that tribe, a man who makes a sign of peace, then draws a knife is called woman-hearted. No Comanche woman-hearted. I say your chief is a coward. You call me coward? You coward. I tell you, "Come out. Fight." Well...here I am. No. If you're not a coward, you'll fight me, man for man. If I fight... you bring other white faces out here? They not have gun? You let them go free if I win? Yes. But you not win. We not fight with knife. Tomahawk, bare hand. You big man. Maybe more strong. You maybe win. But that not show you more brave. We fight, show who most brave. You, me. We will fight... there. You know swallowing sand? Quicksand. We fight there. You... me. Who calls help is loser. Who calls help is coward. All right. Go now. Bring others. Ella? I want you to take this ring. No, Frank. I thought we understood each other. I don't mean like that. I mean, to have. L-Like a present. Why? Because I'm in your debt. How do you mean? I'm not going home either. If we get out of this... I'm going to St. Louis. And I'm gonna find me somebody I pick out myself. And I don't care whether my ma likes her or not. It'll be somebody I picked out... and somebody who's picked me. I'm glad, Frank. Real glad. I'll take your ring. I'll keep it always. What did he say? We've got one chance to get away. But he wants us all outside, unarmed. Unarmed? That's right. You'll just have to trust me. I don't know any other way out for us. All right, Kid. What do you take me for? It's the way I said, Kid. It's our only chance. Look, mister, I don't trust Indians. He wants everybody outside without guns. Well, I'm staying here, and my gun's staying with me. You gonna force my hand? I don't mind, general. Look...I don't want to have to draw with you. I don't blame you. But you're coming out of here. Walking or feet first, you're coming out. Make your move. One last time. I'm asking you. Please drop that gun belt. Look, you bought yourself a showdown. Now stop trying to crawl out of it. I guess the rest of you better get started then. Oh, now, you're a pretty big target. I'm gonna give you a better deal. Are you ready, general? I don't care whether you draw or not... because I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna kill you. You ready? How come I never heard of you? You want to come outside now? Yeah, sure. You mind if I get my hat? Let him go. You can't win, Yellow Knife. I got nothing to gain by crying for help. But you have. I'd rather drown here than be killed by you. Then we both die. It is no great thing. If all the Comanche are like their chief... then the Comanche are brave men.
