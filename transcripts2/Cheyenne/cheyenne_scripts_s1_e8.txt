 Howdy. What are you doing on this range? Just passing through. Running these ponies up to Montana. Not across my land you're not. I didn't know this was ranch. Looked like open range to me. All right, move on. Be glad to. That way! You've gone far enough across my land.

 You want me to double-back? I don't like saddle-tramps that drive herd across my range. Now get moving. You heard Mr. Storm. Scatter 'em. Dad! Dad! Dad! Stay up there till you're told. Hush now, Johnny, that's no way to talk. And put that gun up, y'hear? But, Dad, he rode in- This man's been hurt. What is it, John? A stranger. Looks like he's had an accident.

 Fix the spare room. Bring him right over here, Dad. Sure. We'll just ease you onto the bed and take a look at you. Lie back here now. Easy. Unfasten his gun belt, Johnny. Don't worry, it'll be right here. Where'd you have this accident? On your neighbor's land. Fellow named Storm. Only it wasn't any accident. No, I don't guess it was. Lift up. Easy. It's a little tender. Guess I must have busted a couple of ribs. Oh, my. Johnny, you're all thumbs. Let me. Now, just relax. We'll have this off in a jiffy. Oh, Johnny, dear, you'd better ride into town for the doctor. I should say it's a little tender. Look at that bruise. Does it hurt bad? Not as much as losing my stock. How many ran off? Twenty head. You better bring his saddlebags in. And light a fire under that too. Sure, honey, I'll see right to it. What's that? My stepdaughter's gone for the doctor. Now, just relax. You'll feel better once you're clean and that side's bound up. Can't tell you how kindly I take this, ma'am. It's the least we can do. The trouble is, Storm can afford to pay better wages than the small ranchers, so he hires all our help away. More riders than he needs. He knows we can't operate without hands. What if a fella doesn't wanna be hired away? Storm's pet gunslinger convinces him. That'd be the fella I came up against. Yeah. Name's Swallow. He's picked fights with three cowhands, all legal, all self-defense and all dead. Just like rabbits fighting a rattlesnake. He's that fast. Now, you were mighty lucky to get off with just some busted ribs. Mr. Bodie looks like he can take care of himself. Johnny, are you coming to breakfast? By the way, me and my wife was talking last night. You said you lost your stake and you can't travel much for a while. Now, if you wanted to stay on here- The pay wouldn't be much. What do you say? Well, I- You don't have to feel obligated to say yes. I told Sheila you'd probably wanna be moving on. No. I got some unfinished business near here. I'd like to stay around for a while. You're welcome as long as you want. Then you've hired yourself a hand. Good. Oh. Oh, darn. What's the matter, honey? My heel caught in the hem of my skirt. Aren't you going to help me with my chair, Marty? Huh? Oh, oh, yes, ma'am. What's got into you, girl? What are you doing in that rig? Land sakes, y'act like you've never seen me in a dress before. Your breakfast is all dried out. I don't mind. Just a piece of bread and a cup of coffee. I always eat light. I thought you were gonna ride fence with me today. She'll be a pretty sight riding fence in that outfit. I can change back, can't I? Do you like to ride, Mr...? Mr...? Cheyenne, miss. I love to ride in the early morning when it's just turning pink in the east, don't you? Well, I see lots of dawn. It's most always nice. I knew you'd feel that way. Now, drink a toast, Marty. Looks like I lost a cowhand and found me a daughter this morning. Hello. Mind some company? Not at all, ma'am. Ma'am. I thought that's what you called old ladies you had to be polite to. I sure didn't mean it that way. Do I look like an old, worn-out lady to you? Not so's you'd notice it, ma'am. Sorry you took this job, son? Tell you one thing: never worked any harder in my life. But we seem to be holding our own. I'll take 'em, boss. Only man been working here for months. He's old and should be on easy chores, but he rides just the same as I do. All day and hours after supper. What if the small ranchers were to join together? Couldn't they fight Storm then? Don't think I haven't tried to convince them. But they're independent. They wanna go it alone or not at all. So, Storm squeezes them out one by one. One by one. This ranch is the key. Storm'd like to buy this. Maybe I'm foolish not to sell. Cheyenne, don't you ever stop working? It's past 9. I just this minute finished. I brought you some coffee. You never come up to the house for a cup anymore. Well, there's coffee at the bunkhouse. No need to bother you and John. But thanks. Bother him? He's in there snoring his head off. Couldn't wake him up with a cannon. He works himself pretty hard. I don't care how hard a man works himself. He still could be decent. He don't even wash his face. He don't even say good night. Well, I'll say good night. And thanks for the coffee. Cheyenne... why do you always run off when I come near? Well, if you don't know, I can't tell you. Don't you ever get lonesome? Now and then. So do I. Awful lonesome. You don't know what it is. You've got your man. You married him. Because I didn't know any better. I thought I was getting a good life. Instead I got a little man with big ideas. I don't want him anymore. Tell him then. I'm telling you. All right, you've told me. Now you'd better go back to your husband. What are you, a saint? Far from it. You better go back to the house. Sign it, John. You'll never make a go of this place. Ten thousand's a fair price. You mean for the whole spread? You wait too long and the price might go down, Mr. Dembro. Well, I don't know- Well, look at it this way. You got a pretty wife, a pretty daughter. They want things out of life. Now they can have them. Ten thousand dollars is a lot of money. Johnny rode out to tell me you had company, Mr. Dembro. Well, if it's not our friend with the horses. Thought you were going to Montana. I was. Maybe you should have. He working for you, Dembro? You see him. You going to sell to him, Dad? Storm made me another offer. $10,000. Why, your ranch is worth three times that amount. Circumstances make it worth considerable less. You think I can be of any help? I'm offering to. I'm watching you this time. Maybe you'll learn something. No quarrel, Swallow. There's no need for it. Sign the paper, John. We'll hand you over the money and- No, I think, maybe I'll hang onto it for a while. Oh, Dad. Yes, I think, maybe I'll just do that. Does your hired hand make your decisions for you? No more than yours does for you. You'd better take this, Storm. Storm... you owe me some money for the horses you run off. Well, my foreman here carries the small cash for me. Come over and collect it. Anytime. I expect to, before I leave this valley. You sure told 'em. You gave me some of my fight back. I'm gonna take another crack at banding the small ranchers together. We'll beat Storm yet. Johnny, saddle up. We're gonna round up our neighbors. Sure, Dad, right away. Well, there's something to be said for having an alliance, I admit. Now over in Porterville they've done a pretty good job of it. O'Brien's right. I never did like the idea of joining together. It makes everybody carry somebody else's troubles. I've got enough of my own. But this way everybody'll help you carry 'em. I'm with John Dembro. What Storm's up to is nothing but intimidation. My spread's losing money every day for lack of working hands. If I was you, I'd start getting intimidated. Cheyenne stood up to him today. Let's see how much longer he lives. No, count me out, gentlemen. I'm not looking for any range war. I'm getting by. I guess I've gotta go along with Jeffries. Storm's got the people in town on his side. And the lawmen too. I don't believe in fighting a losing battle. Sorry, John. Me too. How long can you run your spreads without hands to help? You're gonna have to sell sooner or later. If you join together, you can get hands again and protect 'em. Storm's hired killer'll scare 'em off, just like always. Well, I've had my say. Good night to you, John. Good night, Ed. Good night. Night. I'm sorry, John. Well, we tried. You heard? Uh-huh. They're scared, that's all, just plain scared. I can't blame them. You aren't gonna sell, are you? I thought you wanted me to. Don't I have the right to change my mind? Why of course, honey. Well, I guess it's about time I was collecting for those ponies. No, don't you try anything like that. Storm's gunfighter is waiting for you. I saw it in his face this afternoon. I'm only gonna get what's owed me. Takes two to make a gunfight. And one to make a killin'. You'd be surprised how careful I can be. I think I'll turn in. Good night. I'll walk you to the bunkhouse, if it's all right. I'd like a breath of air. Sure. It's not fit for a young girl to go traipsing around at night with a man. What's the matter? She's safe enough. Safe enough? She's only a baby. She's 17 and grown. She wants to nuzzle around some with Cheyenne, I ain't gonna interfere. A man could get stomped to death. Well, up early again tomorrow. You coming to bed? Later. The Indians say that if you look down a well when the moon is full, you can see the face of the one you love the most. All I see is me. Maybe that's what they mean. Indians don't know everything. I guess we'd best be getting in. Just another minute. Do you ever look at the stars? Sleep under them more often than not. Don't you ever get tired of wandering? Some. And think of settling? Sometimes. You've been here awhile. How come? Well, I can't say for sure. Because of me? I wish you'd beat around the bush a little more. You'll be going one of these days. I haven't got time to beat around the bush. Cheyenne, please stay. Well, I wish I could. But I've got places to go and things to find out before I light for good. You think I'm a child, don't you? I'm as much woman as Sheila. You're not too old for me. A wandering man's too old for most everybody some ways. This time next year, you'll hardly remember me. I- Johnny, you'd better come in. It's getting cold. All right. You're wrong, Cheyenne. I could never forget you. Well, did you try to have him make love to you? Do you really think a man like him would want a child like you? You were only 19 when you married my father. There's a lot of difference between 19 and 17. Just like there's a lot of difference between Cheyenne and your father. I never expected you to come out with it. I thought you were better at sneaking behind my father's back. Shut up! What do you know about loving a man? I know enough to love a man fair. Not like you. You're half-crazy wanting something you've no right to have. Shut up! Don't raise your voice and wake Dad up. Don't let him find out about you. Make it light. Hello, Miller. That big fella find you? Big fella? Yeah. He's here looking for you. You mean the one that works for Dembro? Yeah, that's right. He's just down the street. Pour me a drink. I'll be back. I've been looking for you. Heard you were. Now you've found me. Your boss said that I was to collect from you for the horses. Sure. What do you figure we owe you? Twenty head at $10 a piece. Two hundred. Plus time on the trail. I figure 300's about right. I'd say you and your horses together ain't worth more than a plugged nickel. You're entitled to your opinion, but I got my mind set on $300. It's right here. You're welcome to it if you're man enough to take it. That was good shooting. Had to be. I never seen anything like it in my life. Me either. He asked for it. You're witness that I took just $300. That's right. Just a minute. Let's get him out of here, boys. You spoke to us the other night about all joining together. All we small ranchers. Well, I'm for it. And me. Let John Dembro know it. Tell him we'll meet in the lobby of the Cattleman's Hotel tonight. He'll be glad to hear that. Guess I'd best go find the sheriff. Things are gonna be different now, John. Anybody else who hasn't signed up yet? Not only that but six old hands came back to work today when they found what happened to Storm's gunslinger. Good. One man quit riding for Storm and came to work for me. They'll all be back. Sure they will. Anybody want a drink just follow me into the bar. John Dembro's offering a toast to the new alliance. Let's everybody drink to the alliance. Everybody come on in and have a drink. John, don't you think you've had enough? I've been waiting a long time for this night, honey. I just gotta drink to the alliance. Keep it up and they'll have one less member. Sheila, stop picking at him. He's not hurting anything. That's right, honey. Old John Dembro wouldn't hurt a fly. Come on, boys, the drinks are on me. Belly up to the bar, gents, and state your pleasure. Come on, Cheyenne. You too, Miller. You're welcome to join us. Be glad to. Give the storekeeper a drink, too. Everybody drinks with John Dembro. We got an alliance now and a fella to help us that ain't afraid of Martin Storm. Somebody mention my name? So you're all one big happy family now, huh? Yeah, we ain't alone anymore. And you're all gonna stick together, no matter what. That's right. Dembro, I wanna do you a favor. Don't bother. I don't wanna have to like you. I made you an offer for your ranch. I'll double it. Twenty thousand. That's mighty nice of you. But I think I'll hang onto it. Have a drink with John Dembro to the alliance! The alliance. You all run together like a pack of mongrels because you think it makes you strong. Well, keep out of my way. Just keep out of my way. Maybe you'd like to try that with me. You know, you're gonna cross me once to often. The next time you get in my way... is gonna be the last. Well, cock-a-doodle-do! I guess that'll hold him for a while. John, take it easy. You all right, fella? You all right? Help me get him in the wagon, Cheyenne. Take it easy, now. Good night, John. Hope you feel better in the morning. Easy, John, meeting's over. I hope you're satisfied. There isn't a man in this town who isn't laughing at you. Dad! We'll take care of him. Let's put him in the back. Easy does it, John. Oh, Bodie, you're coming back, aren't you? Yeah, we still got some things to settle. Be right in. Good. Shall I go with you? No, I can manage. Sheila doesn't seem too happy. She wants things. Things too hard to get. Come on, we're home. Get out. Aw, don't get mad at me... You've got to unhitch the horse. That Storm... Come on, help yourself some. You've got to unhitch the horse. All right, stay there. Did you see his face? Cock-a-doodle-do. Come on. Get in there. John, John, please get out. John! Come on, John, move yourself, you fat pig, get out of there. John! Anything else, anything at all? No. All I can think of is, maybe when he woke up and saw where he was, he lit the lantern to unhitch the horse. Then he probably forgot about it and climbed back in the wagon to sleep. You know, he'd been, you know, celebrating. Yeah, we know. From the way it looked, the horse could have kicked the lantern over. Yeah. Well, that's about it, Mrs. Dembro. Sorry about the accident. Awfully sorry, Miss Dembro. If you need any help- I'll be around for a while, sheriff. I'll take care of things. Thank you, Cheyenne. It's such a comfort to know. Best thing you can do is go home and try to forget about it. Thank you, sheriff. Sheila, what's the matter? You must have been having a nightmare. Come on, get back in bed. Cheyenne, can I see you a moment, please? Close the door. Sit down. I can't stay long, Mrs. Dembro. I've got to get to the alliance meeting. That's what I want to talk to you about. Why have you got your horse saddled? It's a long walk. You know what I mean. Why haven't you harnessed the buckboard? Is it your way of inviting me to stay at home? No, I hadn't thought about you going. No reason for it. I'll tell you anything that happens. No reason for it? Let me remind you that I own this ranch now. You and Johnny. But I run it and you work for me. You work for me. Isn't that so? In a manner of speaking. Then take orders from me. I wanna go to that meeting tonight. I think you'd best stay right here. They wouldn't be expecting you, not with your man just two weeks under the ground. You do as I say. I'm staying around here to see that John Dembro's wife and daughter are taken care of. Till the alliance starts working. Except for that, I'd been gone long ago. Now, if you'll excuse me. Cheyenne, I'm sorry. It's just that I don't know what to do with myself. Johnny's out riding all the time and- And I'm alone. You do see that, don't you? I do appreciate what you're doing for me, Cheyenne, but at night I just- You've got to learn to live with it sometime. I know. But there's something else. You're more than just a foreman here. Why don't you come and live at the house like I've asked you. There's a spare- The bunkhouse is close by. I want you to stay here. I need you. I get frightened. Of what? Why do you wanna stay away from me, Cheyenne? I told you once. But my husband's dead now. I'm sorry you didn't understand me. It wasn't just your husband. That's not true. You were holding back because of John. Admit it. I've gotta leave if I'm going to- Don't go, Cheyenne. Come back here! Cheyenne, come back! Hi, Marty. Howdy, Johnny. Did you have a good ride? It was dandy. Come along. What's the matter? Sheila! Nothing. Just a little headache. You going someplace? Cheyenne wanted me to go to the alliance meeting with him. But I couldn't. This headache. Besides, it wouldn't be right for me to be seen in public. No. No, it wouldn't. Why don't you leave here, Sheila. You've always hated it. Why don't you leave. I could run the place. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Leave the ranch to you. The ranch and him. Him? You know who I mean. Oh... You poor woman. W-where you going? Into town. Don't go. Stay here. It's getting dark. I'm not afraid of it. Light a lamp. Were you looking for me? Yes, but the house was dark and I- May I come in? Well, I don't know. I'm alone. A friend can certainly offer condolences. I suppose there's no harm in that. Shall I light the lamp? Would you? Please sit down, Mr. Storm. I am sorry about John. He was a fine man. Yes, everyone says that. It'd be a shame to see this ranch go to seed. He set a lot of store by it. Go to seed? Well, it takes a man to run a ranch. Cheyenne runs this one. Cheyenne and me. It's not for sale. Sheila, I'm a man that's misunderstood by most. I came here like the others, with little more than a horse and a pair of hands. But where they raised 12 head of cattle, I worked to raise 100. And where they were satisfied with a house in the open range, I dreamed of owning the land myself. Building an empire from the river to the mountain range. And almost managed it until Cheyenne rode in. He lives here now, you know. Lives here? Yes. Upstairs. That isn't wrong, is it? No, of course not. Cheyenne is going to marry me. He asked ya? He's getting ready to. A woman can always tell a thing like that. Oh? He doesn't impress me as the kind of a man who'd give up his freedom to take himself a wife. You don't know him. I do. We're close. Very close. A man like him wants nothing more than a saddle with a horse under it and an open road in front of him. He wants me. That's what he wants. He's been waiting for me all his life. He told me that. People say it's Johnny he wants. You're lying! He's a man. He wants a woman. He wants me. Johnny's a woman. A ripe young woman. She's nothing. He doesn't even know she's alive. I was the one that bandaged his side and washed the blood off his face. I even killed for- You killed for him? What? You said you killed for him. No. No, I didn't. I'm your friend, Sheila. You need a friend. Somebody to talk to about what's troubling you. There's nothing troubling me. Cheyenne will be home soon. We have to wait awhile before we get married. Sometimes it helps talking to someone. But they've left you here all alone. And they've gone off together. Together? They're not together. Next thing, they'll be accusing you of murder. She'll never get him. She never will. And then when I washed the blood off his face and bandaged his side, he held me, and he whispered to me. He said that we should kill my husband, and then we'd be together, him and me. And then he said, and then- Sheriff, he used her to kill Dembro because he wanted the ranch. A man like that gets a hold on a woman. Look what it's done to her. What are they going to do to me? I just don't know. The circuit judge is in town. We'll soon find out. Got him here, sheriff. What's this all about? You're under arrest, Bodie, for murder. For what? All right, take him away. Lock him up. This way. Still got time for a drink before court opens. That's a good idea. I haven't got much stomach for it. Now, there's no need to feel squeamish, Ben. If Bodie's guilty, and there don't seem much doubt about that, it's only right he gets what's coming to him. Don't you worry none. We'll have him hung all nice and legal... before dinnertime. They say this Judge Crandell's a pretty fair-minded man. Fair enough. See, Johnny? There's nothing to worry about. When do they get the trial started? Maybe sooner than you think. The sheriff looks like he's fixing to cloud up and rain all over somebody. What's the trouble, sheriff? You'll find out. Come on, let's hear this. All right, everybody, might as well go home, now. What's that? Just what I said. Isn't gonna be any trial. What do you mean? Bodie's to get off scot-free. Who says? The judge says. He's been over there talking to Mrs. Dembro. Here it is, men. The law can't touch Bodie because there ain't no witnesses against him. What do you mean, no witness? What about Mrs. Dembro? Judge won't let her take the stand. Why not? She's insane. Now, just a second. You men listen to me. Who drove her insane? Are we gonna let a murderer ride out of this town without lifting a hand against him? What kind of men are we? You can't condemn a man without a trial. Now, wait a minute, Ben. This is no lynch town. It never was. But it seems we can't give him no trial. And that makes us bound to take the law in our own hands. You remember when we had the vigilance committee. You never hung back then. Yeah! Come on, come on. What are you doing? Letting him go. You heard what I said. He's free. But you can't send him out there. Don't you hear them? Can't hold him either. He ain't my prisoner. Got such a thing as a back door? Nope. Come on out, Bodie. Where's my gun? Over in the courthouse. Why don't you go get it. Well, how about you coming along with me? Sorry, friend, I've got an awful lot of work here. Are you coming out, or do we come in after you? Cheyenne, you can't go out there. Well, I can't stay here forever. You kinda stand back out of the way. All right, what've you got to say for yourself? I say I had nothing to do with John Dembro's death. What else would he say? You're making a big mistake, all of you. You made the mistake, and the people of this town are not letting you get away with it. Don't let Storm stampede you. Can't you see its his hate for Bodie that's talking? Bodie stopped you from getting the Dembro ranch. Blocked you in everything you tried to do. He's a better man than you are, Storm. Well, I got no hate for Bodie. But he killed John Dembro, and we all know it. And he's got to answer for it. Miller's right. He's right and you know it. We got no other choice. I got me a rope. Who's got a fast horse? I say stand him in the street and drag-hang him. That's it. Let me have the end of that rope. Give me that horse. All right, out of the way, out of the way, everybody! Wait a minute! Wait! What are you bringing that poor woman out here for? Why not? It's her doing. Hasn't she suffered enough? Take her away, somebody. Come on- Leave her alone. What are you afraid of? What are you afraid she'll say? I'm not afraid of anything. Then let her face me. Sheila. Gonna live in the house. Gonna live in the spare room. He's gonna marry me. Sheila, why did you lie about me? Why did you do it? She don't even know where she is. He did that to her. Come on, get out of the way. Hold on. Let's hear this out. I know why you lied, Sheila. Because you thought he loved me. Because you couldn't bear his not wanting you. She's the one. She made me do it. She made me kill him. She's the one. She's the one. She made me do it. Does anybody believe that? Somebody set him loose. Storm, let go of that rope. Is she dead? Poor Sheila. She wanted so much that she couldn't have. Now she won't slip on you. Thanks. So long, Cheyenne. Goodbye, Marty. There's some chicken and all in here. Don't try to keep it too long. Thanks. I won't. Look, Johnny, if you'd like for me to stay, to help those new cowhands get started, I- That wouldn't be why I wanted you to stay. But it's all right. I mean that. Everything's all right. You've done a lot of growing up in a real short time, Johnny. Goodbye, Cheyenne. Good riding, Cheyenne. Bye, Cheyenne. Bye!
