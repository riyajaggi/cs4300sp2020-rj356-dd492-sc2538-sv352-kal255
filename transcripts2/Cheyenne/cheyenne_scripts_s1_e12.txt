 Rio Hondo. Quiet now, but maybe it's the quiet before the storm. This is the town I was headed for, with two wagonloads of supplies for sale to the highest bidder. Wherever you crossed the Mexican border, there was always the inevitable French patrol. And there were also the inevitable dead. You see. We have arrived safely. I assured you there was no danger.

 Sure. Lined up for another load? We may not have to find another load. Bolados, he's come back. Yeah. He gonna pay us? He owes us. Then I'll tell him. Just wait till he comes out. I'll tell him. Since you will not accept the hospitality of my hacienda- Se?or Bolados, you ought to be more careful of the people you meet on a stagecoach. They might steal your family silver.

 You do have family silver? Uh, perhaps you will dine with me tonight. The cantina is not... too intolerable. I'll be here. I haven't met anybody in this town yet. Well, Se?or Bodie! How fortunate. I thought perhaps you had gone back to the United States. Uh, we must have a talk. We talked last spring in St. Louis. I bought the breed stock you wanted, drove them down here and delivered them to your hacienda. You weren't there. Yes, well I had to make a short trip to our capital. I expected only to be gone one week. But you were gone three months. I went into the transport business to keep eating. Now you can pay me, and I'll go home. Oh, yes, of course. But naturally, I do not have the money with me. If you will come to the hacienda tomorrow- I'll be there. Gracias. Cheyenne... there were some people here for you today. Friends of yours? Friends of f-friends. They only want to use your wagon for one night. They will pay. I'd like to oblige you, Manuel, but I'm not getting mixed up in your local politics. One day, when things are different, it will be good for you. One day, when things are different, I won't be in Mexico. Se?or Bolados. My foreman. If you will excuse me one moment. Some business at the hacienda. Of course. It must be this evening. Hello. All right. Look. I just said hello. I didn't expect- You didn't think I saw you. What? Bolados' wallet. Let's have it. What's got into you? Come on. What are you gonna do? What are you gonna make me do? You know... I think you would. He dropped it, and I picked it up. You were gonna give it back to him. No. I don't like him. That's a reason. And I need the money to get out of here. That's another reason. Well you'll have to pick on somebody that doesn't owe me money. Four hundred pesos and some letters of credit on the St. Louis bank. "I don't have the money with me," he said. "You'll have to come to the hacienda tomorrow afternoon." In case you're interested, he told me he was leaving for St. Louis on the morning stage. He wanted me to go with him. Are you? No. I thought I'd rather steal his wallet. Cheyenne, those friends of mine- I told you, I- Se?or Bodie, please. I must talk to you. I'll see you later? Sit down. We haven't finished our business. Close the door. Who is she? I asked her in, I didn't ask you. Now you better get out of here before the soldiers find you. We're not afraid. Well, I am. You got odd scenery in this country. Too many dead men hanging from too many trees. I thought all Americans were sympathetic to our cause. Maximilian is a European usurper. If he had invaded your country- He didn't. We can pay you 200 pesos. You are about to go to El Maria and pick up two people there, and deliver them here. Why me? You have wagons. You can move about in the curfew. The French think that you are indifferent to our cause. Well, maybe they're right. So why don't y- Yes? It's me, Pete. You was right, Cheyenne. There was a man hanging around them wagons. And that's him. Yeah, I know about it. Oh. It's all right then? Well, I'll be going. One moment. He's not gonna say anything. He is in great haste. He doesn't like to stay under a roof any more than he has to. It makes him nervous. It's all right now, Pete. Oh, that lamp's turned up too high. You ought to be more careful, Cheyenne. He is also afraid of fire. What's funny about that? Nothing at all. What? A smart man knows the right things to be afraid of. Fire, for instance. You listen to her. You're a smart woman. Most ladies ain't smart. Most smart women aren't ladies. Is that better? You look after Cheyenne. I can't watch out for him all the time. I won't take my eyes off of him. We'll see you later, Pete. Se?or. Sorry you made the trip for nothing. I sympathize with you, but I'm not getting mixed up in your troubles. Come on, we got business. But- But, se?or... Make yourselves at home. Careful on the way out. Do we give it back to him? You do. But I'll go along. I wanna see his face when you do it. You're not always so tough on people. You carry that old man. Pete? We teamed up together. You carry him, but you don't let him know it. Now, who else would team up with him? Pete was a good man in his day. Until...? Finally got too old for the trail, settled down under a roof. Married a Mexican woman, had a son. There was a fire. He got home too late to save them. Just in time to hear them. I guess I've got no troubles at all. Se?orita, I've been looking all over for- Oh. I did not know you two were acquainted. She's got something to tell you. Here's your wallet. Where did you get it? I stole it. You, you- I stole it. Better make sure nothing's missing. No. I'm sure it is all here. Four hundred pesos and $1500 in letters of credit. I hear you were taking the morning stage. Well I- I was going to. You were going to endorse a couple of those letters of credit. Yes. Yes, of course, I... I don't like him any better than you do. Manuel. Pen and ink. S?. Couldn't write any faster than he could duck. Bolados. This is unfortunate. He was loyal to His Majesty the Emperor. A straight shot. Are you blaming my soldiers? Of course not, se?or colonel. I will pick out certain individuals. Those I do not designate will leave immediately. This place then will remain closed for this evening. I told you... I've got no troubles at all. The next time suspicious characters enter your place, you will notify us. How would I know who is suspicious? I think you will know. Who's next? We are. Any reason for leaving us till last? Why not? You're both amiable people. No? No. Se?or Bolados was carrying no money. Only some letters of credit. That is hard to believe. He had 400 pesos. I took it. So... He owed me 800. That will be decided. Part of this is mine. If your claim is just, it will be returned. Next. Brown, Mary. American. Arrived in Veracruz six months ago from Panama. And since Veracruz? Too many places... on the road north. The last? It's on the papers. Commandant countersigned it. His name? To me French officers are like Indians. I can't tell them apart. All that gold braid gets in my eyes. It would be wise to modify your tone. Believe me, we are not happy to be exiled in these dusty villages... teaching civilization to these people. We do not enjoy your pleasantries. Why did you stop here? Money. I didn't have enough not to. Where were you when the shooting occurred? You don't have to answer his questions. Go ahead, slap me. We have no wish to quarrel with you, Monsieur Bodie. On the contrary, we wish your friendship... unless your sympathies- My sympathies are for staying out of other people's quarrels. That's what we have assumed. In your business you must see many things worthy of observation. The French army would be most appreciative- I haven't seen a thing you'd be interested in. Perhaps when you return to discuss this, your memory will be improved. Kind of high-handed, weren't they? So were you. Oh, I'm sorry if you didn't approve. I noticed you were real respectful. They don't like your not helping them. You know, life could be a lot easier for you if you- Se?or. Since when did Picard start hiring Mexicans to do his dirty work? Picard? I swear to you, se?or- It's not Picard. Bolados. This is his foreman. So he put you up to this? You killed him. You killed him, se?or. Somebody liked him after all. Look, I didn't kill your boss. If I had, I wouldn't have any worries about killing you, would I? You had a reason. There's no reason to it. It was a stray shot. An accident. I was there. You've made a mistake. Now get out of here. You're lucky one of you didn't get killed. Take your friend with you. Thanks. Nothing to it. You weren't the only one out of luck when Bolados was killed. He was gonna buy me a dinner. Hungry? Starved. Picard cleaned you out, didn't he? You're broke, aren't you? Aren't you? Oh, maybe I could get a meal for myself anyway. Maybe. I'm afraid I couldn't get one for you though. Go ahead. Bonsoir, sergeant. I thought Picard closed this place. Cook's a friend of mine. Male or female? Who? The cook. He'd like you fine. He's still up, if, uh- I've eaten, remember? Good dinner? Better than the company. Not hungry now? Oh, no. Couldn't eat a bite. That why you can't take your eyes off this? Am I that obvious? Didn't have any luck, huh? I didn't stay. Where you been? Walking. Why? Well, so you'd think I stayed. Why? I thought you might be sore. Well, why should I be? Why should I be? But I am. I've been sore ever since I met you. Sorry. You had me placed right away. You didn't see me take that wallet... but you knew I had it. I thought maybe I could make you feel cheap too. How long you been away from home? This is about the time for it, isn't it? The story of your life, I got a pretty good idea. Well, who told you? The slap you took. You didn't turn a hair. What shall I give you? The beautiful old days in Mississippi before the war? The old plantation? Only my father was a doctor. He didn't have a plantation. He was just as loyal to the old life as if he had. He and some friends knew it was going, and they- They figured they'd have a better chance in South America. The Brazilian government promised lands and a big welcome. I heard some Southerners immigrated. Well... maybe some of them even made it. My father's friends weren't very practical about it. Maybe it wasn't very practical to begin with. The captain wasn't honest, the boat wasn't seaworthy. We wound up stranded and broke in Panama. No money. No big South American welcome. My father lived six months. Luckily, he was too sick to know the ways I was supporting him. This was one of them. And you've been trying to get home ever since? I'd walk... but they tell me it's a long way between water holes. Here. Pick a card. Any card. If you ask him right, the cook will give you one of these on credit. May be starting home sooner than you think. You always knock like that? No problem. I'm a doctor's daughter, remember? What did you mean when you said, I might be starting home sooner than I think? You're not tough enough for towns like this. You think you are. Maybe you should be by now. But you're not. You're gonna do that job for Manuel and his friends. Don't get the idea that I'm doing it just for you. Don't do it at all. You're not the only one who's noticed the scenery. Too many dead men on too many trees. When I said that, I had money coming to me. Is that the only reason? Money they're gonna pay you? What else? Won't Manuel help you without you having to do this? I owe him money already. I don't want his help. Don't do it. Please. Why don't you go to bed. These are real. Even in this town they ought to bring something. I thought you were broke. They were my mother's. I've- I've tried to hang on to them. But you expect me to take them. At the way it is with you, you won't take anything from anybody. Especially not those. What did you do that for? I been wondering if I'd like it. Well? I don't know yet. I thought you wouldn't take anything from anybody. Changed my mind. Change your mind about these too? These belong to me. So do my lips. I don't see the difference. I do. You're gonna have a big day tomorrow. Good night. You'll see she gets the money. S?. I will put her on the stage myself. Would you like me to tell her anything? She doesn't like for anybody to tell her anything. All ready, Cheyenne. What's that? Something we may get a chance to deliver to the army. Well...no point in taking me along if you don't tell me things. I wouldn't remember anyway, Cheyenne. All right, Pete. It is clear in your mind, eh? You will pick up the load. That will give you an excuse if they question you tomorrow. On the way back- I know the canyon, Manuel. You will deliver them to us at the meeting place behind the town. I hope you do not fail us, Cheyenne. So do I. Hyah! La palabra, por favor. A knife for Maximilian. All right, Pete. What's the idea? I am Ramon Santalban, se?or. My wife. What kind of a war you people fighting, dragging your women around with you? It's not your concern. A man is no good if he leaves someone behind to be taken as hostage. Yeah. That's a nice perfume you're wearing. You are American. What happened to the men who were to meet us? They had some trouble. And why did you take their place? Because I'm being paid. I suspected so. Whoa. Get moving. Giddap! What is it? French patrol. We cannot outrun horses in a wagon. We can try. Ramon, this is a signal attempt. Stop! We will give ourselves up. Ramon! He'll be all right! Here, put this under him. I don't want blood on the wagon. Rien. Well...? Nothing. What did you expect to find? There was a trace of perfume. It reminded me of Paris. But I can hardly believe... Beauclerc searched the wagon before you did. I've always wondered about his hair oil. Very well. You may go. For the present. We fooled him good. Think so? Better get undercover today, Pete. Huh? I mean get out of sight. And stay out of sight. Mm. Mm-hm. ? One of these days ? ? And it won't be long ? ? Call my name ? ? And I'll be gone ? ? Fare thee well Oh, honey ? ? Fare thee well ? ? Remember one night A drizzlin' rain ? ? Around my heart I felt a pain ? ? Fare thee well Oh, honey ? ? Fare thee well ? Hello. Why didn't you get on that stage last night? Didn't Manuel tell you? He's still got your money. I decided to wait for you. I went to a lot of trouble to get you out of here. That's why I didn't go. Manuel's gonna give me a job. Heh. Professor and I have been rehearsing. Cheyenne. What happened? The soldiers were looking for you. Picard's giving us rope. I don't think it'll stretch too far. Any trouble after I turned Santalban over to you? No. But his wife refused to let us take him on. She said it was too far. He would die. She is a very strong-minded woman. This country is full of them. Hm. Where are you trying to get him to? To the United States. You did not know? I didn't ask. He is very badly wounded. Anyone can see that. All you got to do is get the bullet out. It's not very deep. I looked at it. It would not be safe to get a doctor for him. Will you take out the bullet? I know you've handled gunshot wounds before. You think the colonel isn't waiting for a move like that. Why, the minute I stepped outside... No need. I brought them here. You brought them here? They're in the wine cellar. It hasn't been used for years. The French will never search there. Cheyenne. I'm sorry, Manuel. Maybe she doesn't wanna leave here, but I do. I'm heading north first chance I get. But taking out the bullet would be easy for you. I would be afraid to try. He must be saved. His mission is important to us. I told you I wasn't getting mixed up in your politics. I'm in too deep already. I did the job you paid me for. That's enough. Look... I know you can use all the money you can get. If you didn't have to pay your bill here... It has been somewhat in arrears, Cheyenne. Throw in her bill too? Of course. You almost had me figured right, except for one thing. I'll still owe you that bill. Better get busy in the kitchen. Water? At once. I'll get it. You? My mammy taught me every girl should know how to cook. You. Where is the doctor? We could not bring one. It would be too dangerous. Dangerous? Am I to sit here and watch my husband die because a pack of cowards- Quit yelling. He'll be all right, as soon as we get the bullet out of him. You think I would let you touch him? Cheyenne has experience in these matters. Yes. I saw how he helped Ramon last night. Brutally. I had to stop the bleeding. We were in a hurry. A man who helps us for hire will betray us for hire. Ramon will have a doctor. I will bring one myself. No, no, se?ora. Don't you dare to touch me. Let her go, Manuel. Let her go? The moment she appears on the street- She won't. She's not that stupid. She's just acting like an aristocrat. She just stopped acting like one. She's mad at me. Is she? Who are you? Just another volunteer. Don't slap her, she might slap you back. It was my father's. I thought it might be less messy than a bowie knife. Listen. I told him to play that if there are any soldiers looking around. How long has he been unconscious? More than an hour. I don't think he'll do any screaming. But if he does, stuff that in his mouth. Mm. Do you think you've pulled yourself together enough to be useful? Let's have that light. Are you sure you'll be all right? ? One of these days And it won't be long ? ? Call my name And I'll be gone ? ? Fare thee well Oh, honey ? ? Fare thee well ? ? When I wore my apron low ? ? You always hanging Round my door ? ? Fare thee well Oh, honey ? ? Fare thee well ? ? I got a man And he's long and tall ? ? Moves his body Like a cannonball ? ? Fare thee well Oh, honey ? ? Fare thee well ? ? If I had wings Like Norah's doves ? ? I'd fly up in the blue... ? Seen Pete around? No. Did you expect him? Told him to keep out of sight. He's doing too good a job of it. She has a very good voice, no? The customers like her. For her voice? ? If I had listened To what my mammy said ? ? I'd be at home In my mammy's bed ? ? Fare thee well Oh, honey ? ? Fare thee well ? You didn't applaud. Where did you learn to do that? Same place as I learned everything else I know. Like card tricks? There is no end to my accomplishments. How's your patient? I knew this conversation was going too well. He's much better. I think he can even travel tonight. Why, you won't be able to move him for a week. This town's hotter than a bonfire in July. Picard's up to something. How long will it take you to pack? You pulling out? Soon as Pete shows up. You might as well come along. Well, if you really want me. Why not. They say there's safety in numbers. Go on. You can't make me sore anymore. Or do you like me sore? Go on upstairs and pack. I can't. Why? I packed six hours ago. All right, come off that balcony. What are you doing here? I had to see you. Do you realize what a chance you're taking? Manuel brought me up the back way. If there was trouble, I had this. That would be a big help holding off an army. I had to see you. You said that. To... To apologize and- And to thank you. You have saved my husband's life. That's not excuse enough for taking a risk like this. My husband is not a coward, Se?or Bodie. It is for me he is afraid. I didn't say he was. It is true he- He is not a physical man. He's not used to violence. And now he's afraid that they have chosen the wrong man, and he will fail in what he has to do. What is this great mission he's on? We are to pick up a shipment of arms in the United States and bring it back across the border to our men in the mountains. You take my advice. When you get to the States, you'll thank your patron saints and sit tight. You've got about as much chance in getting guns by the border guards as a rabbit in a snake pit. I know it will be dangerous. That is why I am here. Don't bother to say it. You. You are a physical man. If you would help us, I- Will you get it through your head once and for all. I don't want any part of this. I don't like Picard and his toy soldiers. But why should I stick my neck out for you? I cannot offer you more money. It is needed for guns. If my husband does not succeed in this, he will not be able to live with himself. I... I would do anything for my husband. Anything. Picard's on his way up here. Did he see you come up? No, I don't think so. Take her out there. Hello. Monsieur Bodie. You wanted to see me? Yes. I was on my way downstairs. It's cooler below. But more private here. Thought you wanted to be friends. No. Sorry I don't have an armchair for you. That elusive perfume. Sorry if I interrupted anything. Beauclerc. Come out, Mississippi. Well...your acquaintance has ripened. You took a journey in Monsieur Bodie's wagon? Smart girl is always interested in a man's work. I just looked it over, that's all. So now we're all here. Uh... Except your man. Your friend. So that's where he is. What are you doing to him? Nothing. His cell is quite comfortable. Small perhaps, but uh... comfortable. What do you do when you're not torturing people? Give lessons to snakes? We even brought him straw to sleep on. There's a lantern on the floor just outside his cell, to make the night more cheerful. He seems to feel some apprehension that the lantern is too near the straw. Why, if you keep him locked up like that, he'll be out of his mind before morning. I would be delighted to release him at any time. At any time you decide to be cooperative. And I wouldn't hesitate too long. Who can judge the moment when a mind will finally give way forever? Don't move. Don't even breathe. You won't be breathing long anyway. You won't do any good by this. It won't help the old man. Maybe not. Maybe it's too late to help him anyway. But at least I'll get a little satisfaction. You are not the type to kill in cold blood. Cold blood? Look at that. How far do you think you can push people? Who do you think you are coming over here to teach civilization? Slapping women around, torturing old men. Isabella. The Do?a Isabella Santalban. She doesn't like Frenchmen. She'll be glad to see one die. You wouldn't. Mississippi. Tell the piano player to play loud. Real loud. I'll even sing. Wait. What do you want from me? Tell the officer in command that the colonel could not spare a soldier to deliver the message. And bring Pete back as soon as they let him out. Put two more names on that safe conduct. Ramon Santalban and wife. Get your husband ready to travel. Gracias. Yeah? What the well-dressed girl will not wear crossing the border. Pete. Hello, Cheyenne. We going somewhere? That's right. That's good. She going with us? That's right. That's better. You all right, Pete? You bet. I didn't like that place, Cheyenne. They wanted me to remember. I was awful tempted to remember. But I didn't. You did real fine. Your wagon is already in the back, and the passengers are there. Good. Told Picard you'd let him go in the morning. We are not like the French. We will keep our word. You know he'll come back and burn this place down. My friends and I are of no further use here. It is time we join the others in the mountains. Maybe I'll see you there. I've got one more transport trip to make. Cheyenne. I- Bye, Professor. Thanks. Adios, Mississippi. I will be very sorry not to see you again, se?orita. Well now, don't be too sure. I'm a hard girl to shake. Shake? Shake. It's an American term. Slang, you know. Who started that rumor that the South lost the war?
