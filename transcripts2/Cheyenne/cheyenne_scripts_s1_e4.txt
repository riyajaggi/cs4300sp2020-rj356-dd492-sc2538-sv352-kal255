 Cheyenne (1955â€“1963): Season 1, Episode 4 - Border Showdown - full transcript 
 Cheyenne and Smitty ride into a border town to eat and rest. The stage driver, Buckshot spots Cheyenne who he knows. He tells them that the bank was held up the night before and Brad Farnum, a close friend of Cheyenne, was run down in the street by the bandits. Buckshot wounded the leader a blonde man. The marshal tells them the group crossed the border into Mexico where they likely went to the town of Paso Alto. Cheyenne decides he and Smitty will cross over and bring the leader back to the marshal. They ride into the town where everyone seems to be scared. After asking about the blonde man, they are refused service at the hotel. They are told by a store owner's daughter Rosa to go to the cantina where they find the gang and the leader Carl Thompson. After a spat with henchman Cliff Bartow they leave. Bartow decides to go after Cheyenne. He confronts him in the general store but Cheyenne is able to put him down in a fist fight telling him to tell Thompson to come after him himself. Thompson then gives the pair one hour to leave town.

 Get mounted. All right, let's go. The blond-headed guy is the leader. Get the blond guy. Mmm, real cookin'. Baked bread, hamhocks and sauerkraut. Chicken and dumplings. Better slow down, Smitty. We still got a half a sack of sowbelly and beans left. You can have my share. Me, I'm goin' in here.

 Hey, there! Buckshot! Well, what do ya know? Cheyenne. Smitty. Last time I heard, you were running map lines for the Army over in Comanche country. Got 'em right here. Say, I'd be mighty obliged if you'd drop these off at the Big Sands remount station. Glad to. Here, take care of these, Bill. It's a good thing the army's got you fellas.

 Them soldier boys would never find their way across Injun territory if they didn't. Yeah, I guess- Hey, I remember back in '61. It was this here troop, uh, B Troop of the seventh- Uh, yeah, uh, you told us, Buckshot. We heard that one before. What's new? Oh, nothing much. 'Cept last night the bank was robbed, hit for every nickel they had. Old Brad Farnum got run down by a horse. Brad Farnum? Was he hurt bad? Killed him. Killed him dead. He never had a chance. Never even had a gun on him. Saw the whole thing with my own eyes. Say, the old man was a good friend of yours wasn't he? That's right. That's what I thought. You boys gonna be in town long? Right now, it's kinda hard to say. Well take it easy, Buckshot. So long, Smitty. The leader's a tall, blond-headed fella. And he might be limping some, if Buckshot winged him like he says. Shouldn't be too hard to spot. Nope. Well, I ain't one to tell ya your duty, marshal. But if I was you, I'd just purely mount up- My hands are tied, you know that. Even the Mexican authorities can't pick him up as long as he's in the clear down there. You pretty sure he crossed the border? I oughta be. I was chasing him when he did it. I'd give a year's pay to get my hands on him. Maybe you will. When he comes back across the line. That's not likely. He might. Especially, if, uh, someone who wasn't weighed down with a badge kind of helped him back. Any idea where he'd head for in Mexico? A little town called "Paso Alto" about 40 miles south of the line. Thanks, marshal. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. You can. You can be waitin' at the border when we bring him back. Did you say "we"? W-E? That's right. That's what I thought you said. About all I can wish you is a lot of luck. Thanks. There it is. Paso Alto. You know, I wouldn't mind owning some of this land. We ain't careful, we liable to. About six foot apiece. You remember what I told you? Yep. We're a couple desperate characters on the dodge. Say, what's my name? Smith. Smith. But that's my real name! Who's gonna believe it? Where is everybody? Maybe they got enough sense to stay out of the sun. Wish we'd a had sense enough to stay home. Just keep your eyes open. I've seen expressions like that before. So have I, on a grizzly with a sore paw. Say, do you get the feeling we ain't exactly popular? Why should we be? Well, I was very well-liked back- Say now! Dos pesos, Enrique. Dos pesos! Aye, we are so far from... Papacito. What is it, my daughter? Two more Americanos ride in. Two more! Two more bad ones I am thinking. You know, it just so happens I've got a few little purchases I'd better make over here at this, uh, tienda store. Now, I'll be right back. Smitty. Later, huh? We've got to find ourselves a room. I swear you take the fun outta everything. Perhaps it is time we try again, Miguel. No. It would be nice to hear the bells once more. And more of our young men to die before the gringo's guns, hey? Perhaps the old ones like us then. What could we do? Hey! Anybody here? Here he comes. I'm sorry, se?ores. I laid down un momento to rest my eyes. Uh, room perhaps or something to eat? We could use both. Bueno. The corner room is vacant. Uh, do you se?ores intend to honor us for a long time? Well, that all depends. We're looking for a friend of ours. Oh. This way, se?ores. Big blond fella. Might be limping a little. I have remembered. The corner room, it is engaged. That happened in a hurry. It slipped my mind. My youngest brother is coming from San Philipe- Forget it. Let's go, Smitty. Come on. Well, that was short and sweet. Yeah. One mention of that big, blond-headed fella, and he turned as sour as buttermilk in a thunderstorm. Yeah. You know something? What? I don't believe he had no brother in San Phillipe. You know something? What? Neither do I. Still wanna make those purchases. Ho, ho, ho. Do I? But, se?or, if you would allow me to help you. When I want your help, I'll ask for it. And another thing, shorty. You better order up some more.44s. You're running low. Senoridy. You likey takem heap big buggy ride? Spanish, Smitty. Not Navajo. Please, se?or. If you would perhaps pay a little something on your account. What's the matter? Don't you trust me, shorty? Se?or, I do not mean the insult. But to run my business, I must have the money. Excuse me, se?or. But I wonder if you could tell me... Get out of here. Get out. Go back to your friends at the cantina. Much obliged, ma'am. I might just do that. There they are. Cerveza. S?, se?or. I didn't now you could speak Spanish? You just heard all of it. Nice-looking bunch of boys. Their mothers probably love 'em. You fellas looking for something? Yeah. What? A glass of beer, you mind? It's a long ride into this town for a glass of beer. It ain't every place you can get beer like this. Warm and flat. Ain't that right, Chey-? Uh, Mr. Eubanks? Your name Eubanks? Could be. What's on your mind? I ask the questions. You ever get any answers? I think I'll get one from you. That all depends. I haven't heard the questions yet. What are you two doing in town? Now, that's the wrong question. Go ahead, nosey, make your play. Break it up. You boys know I don't like brawling. Get on with your business. My name's Carl Thompson. This your place? You might say it's sort of a headquarters. The man who owns it is a real fine fellow. A friend of mine. Isn't that right Alfredo? S?, Mr. Thompson. Is that a friend of yours too? In a manner of speaking, yes. Got much use for him? He runs errands for me now and then. Keep him outta my way, or you may have to run 'em yourself. Oh, Cliff's all right. He just doesn't like strangers. I don't like strangers either, and he's mighty strange to me. We don't have visitors here very often. Maybe you oughta change your brand of beer. Yeah... Maybe I should. Alfredo, let's have two fresh beers for my friends. You're kind a free and easy with that word "friend," aren't you? If a man isn't a friend of mine, I, uh- I assume he's my enemy. Suits us, mister. You're two pretty tough characters, aren't you? Nope. We're not tough. We're like your errand boy, here. We just talk tough. You know, I might be able to use a man like you. We'll think it over. Don't think it over too long. Let's go find a place to stay. I, uh- I don't think I heard your name. That's right, you didn't, did ya? I got an idea. What? Well, instead of us gettin' a place to sleep tonight. Let's get out of town. I'm taking him back, Smitty. I wanna see him in front of a jury. With all them gunslingers behind him, that just might turn out to be quite a chore. We got him worried and a worried man makes mistakes. Well, in that case, don't look for me to do anything right. I'm worried too. Where now? To the stables. This town can't have anything against horses. Water our horses, s?? S?, se?or. You pay now? How much? One peso. How much for the hay? Two pesos. How much if we sleep on the hay? Oh, that's three pesos. That's a deal. Is there a place around here where a fella can get a good meal? S?. El Placio. Gracias. To us. Salud y pesetas. Yeah. Carlos, how long we stay buried here? It has been four months now since you promised to take me to- What do you think of those new Americans? The tall one is handsome. No? That's not what I mean. It's just- It is just that they may be looking for you? Is that what is on your mind? Well, they sure came here looking for something. You are in some sort of trouble? I'm always in trouble. Last time I crossed the border, I had to kill a man. Listen to me, Carlos. Perhaps those men are after you, or perhaps they are not. What difference does it make? You promised me we would go to Mexico City. All right, we'll go. When? A year from now? Ten years from now, when I'm an old woman? We'll go when I say so, not before. Well, what are you up to? Gonna go hunting? Yeah, I figured I get me a lawman. I'm not so sure he is a lawman. What's he gotta do, show you his badge? Why take chances? Cliff. Yeah? Better get the big fella first. I was planning to. Now, see, this ol' girl, she says to me, "Now, you be sure and bet on my box lunch. "Now you gonna know it, 'cause it's tied up with a red ribbon." Well, I come to find out that there must've been eight or ten of them there that way. Now, what do ya do about a situation like that? So this here gal that I ended up with. Why, she weighed 275 pounds if she weighed an ounce. You got the draw on me. I'm gettin' mighty sick of you, mister. Look out, Cheyenne! Go on, Cheyenne! That oughta do it, Cheyenne. Tell your boss, if he wants my hide, come get it himself. Here. Not that you need the dang thing. Thanks. Gracias, Se?or. Gracias. I'm sorry about the mess. It is nothing, se?or. Padre mio. What has happened? Papa, are you all right? Very much all right. Thanks to these gentlemen. It wasn't nothin' really. Uh, why don't we go put on the nosebag, huh? Yeah. Wait a minute. We'd better stay and help clean up this place. Oh, do not worry, se?or. I will clean this all up with the greatest of pleasure. You go have a good dinner, eh? I guess I forgot to discard. Too bad. Start pouring. When's the funeral? Well...you look like you ran into a mountain cat. I run into Cheyenne Bodie. The stranger? That's his name. Sent you a message. Oh? Says if you want his hide, to come get it yourself. That sounds like a fair enough proposition. Carlos? Yeah? I think it is better we leave Paso Alto. I think it's better you leave thinking to me. But I am afraid of this man. We could leave tonight for Mexico City. By morning, we will be many miles from here. Look, why don't you stop bothering me. I told you we'd leave soon. You got my promise. A promise? I spit on your promise. Shut up. I do not take orders from you. Shut up! I got your message. News travels real fast, doesn't it? Small town, people talk. About anything in particular? They say you strayed pretty far from home. Shall we stop playing games? All right. What are you after? You. You're a pretty big man. I hear you're fast with a gun. But nobody's that big or that fast. It's a matter of opinion, mister. You really think you can take me back across the border? We'd make a pretty good try at it. Then you'd better get busy. You don't have much time. How's that? I'm giving you one hour to get out of town. And if we're still here? Don't be. Delgado, what time is it? Three o'clock. Four o'clock, Mr. Bodie. We staying, Cheyenne? We've gone too far to back out now. Se?or, I would like to shake your hand. For a long time, no one in this village has faced Thompson like that. Tell me something, amigo. How is it you let these gunslingers run so hog-wild around here? Yeah, it seems to me you could turn some law loose on these fellers. Here, the army is the law. The territory is very large, se?or. And Paso Alto is far off the beaten track. Once, maybe twice a year, we see a patrol. That's all. Well, there must be something you could do? At the very beginning, we tried. Now, 14 of our young men lay dead. A town has a soul, se?or. The soul of Paso Alto, is also dead. Se?or Delgado, forgive me, but this is not true. It is not the soul of the village which is dead but the courage of the people. Perhaps you are right, Rosa. Papa told me what you did. Are you going to help us? Two against them? What chance do they have? We'll probably need more help than we'll be giving. There are still guns in Paso Alto, and men to shoot them. If you would lead, I think they would follow. Can we count on you, Se?or Delgado? I do not know. Who's your mayor? Your alcalde? That's Se?or Monte Verde. The big house at the end of the street. Perhaps he will help you. And I will speak to Alfredo. He will help us too. You'd better talk fast. By 4:00, things are gonna start gettin' lively. Se?or, what did he mean? What is going to happen at 4:00? The bad one, Thompson. He gives the two Americanos until that time. Then, he comes to kill them. There's not much time then. No, perhaps the mayor will persuade the others. And you? What will you do to help them? Me? I- I am only one man. No, you are not a man. There are no men left in Paso Alto. Wait. Wait a minute. Why can't you? Please, please, se?or. I can talk to them, and they will listen, but they will do nothing. I cannot make them act. I'm only the mayor. Act with what? They take our guns long ago. They hide them. We do not know where. We have our guns, and we have two rifles on our saddles. They just went down to the mayor's house. Well, they're wasting their time. Why don't we go for 'em right now? 'Cause I gave 'em an hour. Alfredo. Alfredo! That guy's never around when you want him. Rosa. Rosa, let's get married now. We'll go to the church and tell Father Juan to make the arrangements for the wedding. No, not while there is so much trouble. But why not? This man can help us, Alfredo. I know he can. But we must help him, too. No please, Rosa, no more about that. Do you wish to live in fear of these people? I wish to live. You know what happened the last time. At least now I have my cantina, and things are not too bad. But somehow, somewhere, there must be a start. Well, let someone else start it. I must think of my business if we're ever going to be married. All right. Think of your precious, little cantina, and we never will be married. Stop being so itchy! You boys are acting like you're going to your own funerals. If anybody doesn't like this deal, he can pull out. Get me a drink. I said, get me a drink. Are you deaf? I am not deaf. And also, I am not your servant. Why don't you get outta here? Go home! You are the last hope, Padre Juan. Only you can help us now. I think you do not know what you ask, my child. When these people first came to our town, the young men thought as Rosa does, that we should band together and drive them out. I myself, gave the signal. The ringing of the church bell. My poor shepherds. My poor farmer boys. I should've known they were no match for gunfighters. Fourteen young men. God rest their souls in peace. From that day on, the bell has been silent. That is the way it must remain. Padre Juan. I'm an old man. I can have no more lives on my conscience. I hope you understand. You have to do what you think is right. Thanks. Good bye, Padre. Well, we tried. Perhaps we could still- No, our time's too short. I wish you hadn't said that. Why don't you go back to the tienda? We'd better get back to the stables. Aw, now you're talking. Why, if we ride right- In an hour, we'll have Thompson. Or he'll have us. You say the nicest things. It's two minutes till 4. I say that's close enough. Drink up. All right, spread out. It's gettin' mighty close to 4:00, Cheyenne. If we could just figure a way to break Thompson loose from those gunslingers. Se?or! Se?or! It's the tamale from the cantina. Let her in. What can I do for you? It is not what you can for me. It is what I can do for you. You know the money from the Twin Pass Bank? What about it? It is under the floorboards at my house. That'll break Thompson loose. He'll follow that money. It might be a trick. It is no trick. All right, let's go. Stay back. It's 4:00, Bodie. Yeah, I guess it is. Well, looks like Mr. Cheyenne Bodie's got himself in a nice little trap. Cliff, you get around behind. The Americans, are we just gonna let them die? We can't do nothing. We've done nothing for too long. Are we gonna let them die without lifting a hand to help? Can we face ourselves if we do this? How can we fight? With what? We have brooms and rakes. Alfredo! Alfredo. I know where the guns are hidden. Do you have the courage to use them? Listen, listen. I will lead you to them if you will fight. We are not soldiers. Maybe our guns are rusted now. They will kill us. Yes, they will kill you. If you fight or you do not fight, they will kill you. Keep 'em busy. George. Thompson. Table. Alfredo. Where's Thompson? I saw him. He got away. The girl, Sarita, where's her house? I will take you to her, se?or. Sarita. Sarita! I am here. Good. Get the money, chiquita. We're going to Mexico City like I promised. Just you and me together. Yes, just you and me. Hurry up, get the money! Yes, just you and me, together, always. All right, Thompson, come on out! Come on out, Thompson, and don't try the back way. All right. Open the door. Open it! Sorry to disappoint you, Bodie. Kill him! Padre.
