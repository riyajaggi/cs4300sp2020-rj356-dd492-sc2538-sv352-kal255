 Keep your back turned and drop your gun belt. You heard me, unbuckle your gun. Put those guns away. They bother ya? One might go off, and I'm wearin' a new shirt. That's right funny now. Give me that wallet. Why not? It's not mine. I already know that. Take a look at his gun, Todd. One chamber's empty.

 Look, mister, if you know anything about guns, you don't keep a live charge under the hammer. I've known people to get a hole in their leg that way. We're not interested in your explanations. See, Logan was a friend of ours. Who's Logan? You ought to know. You just shot him. You're kinda goin' off halfcocked, aren't you, mister? I haven't shot anybody. Well, I don't see anyone else around. I see a lot of country around here. Somebody could've hit him before you got here. You're packin' a gun with one chamber fired, and you're carrying another man's wallet.

 I guess that's all we need. Now, get on your horse. Where we goin'? Laramie. You the law around here? We'll turn you over to the law. You'll get a trial. This, uh, Logan... he have many friends like you in Laramie? Quite a few. You object to coming along with us? I object, but I'm not going to argue about it. ? Oh, my darling ? ? Oh, my dar- ? ? -lin', Clementine ? That's far enough. Throw your guns down on the ground. Cut the big fellow loose. Now get out and get out fast. Help yourself to a gun. We better hit the breeze before those jokers borrow some guns and come back. Which way ya headed? I was headed for Laramie, but, uh, I don't think the climate would agree with me. Where you goin'? Far, far away. Want to ride along? Mind telling me why you did this? I just don't like to see a man hanged for someone I shot. But don't get the wrong idea, he drew first. You know, it just ain't natural. What? Aren't you gonna ask me why I killed that fellow back there? Thought I hadn't better. His gun was only half out of the holster. He still drew first. Or maybe you don't believe that. Make any difference? Yeah, it does. You'd have to be pretty fast. I am. I never saw you handle a gun. That's right. I figure if a man makes a play, he ought to be able to back it up. I figure that way too. I reckon he drew first. You don't shoot so bad yourself. Or was it an accident? You or me? You. I guess it could've been. I'd sort of like to find out. Got another dollar? Let's find out free of charge. Any time you're ready. I'm ready. Accidents happen all the time. Yeah, they sure do, don't they? Say, what do you do for a livin'? Depends on how bad I need money. You and I were to throw in together, we might make quite a team. Or are you a loner? Most of the time. That doesn't mean a man wouldn't like to have a friend. Yeah, they're hard to come by. How'd you like to tie in with me? Looks like I'm kinda tied in already. I didn't have much of a future till you put the run on that outfit. Yeah, you and I might make quite a pair. Sort of quiet, isn't it? Wakes up after dark. Been here before? I passed through once. Are you staying over or do you just want them fed and watered? We're staying over. You'll have to pay me the cash in advance. Well, you got the horses. Mister, you'd be surprised how many people leave horses here and don't come back, on account the horse don't belong to them to begin with. We're coming back. What's the best hotel in town? We- There's only but one, the Palace, right down the street. Thanks. You're supposed to use that stuff after your hot bath, Pat. Who's got time for baths? Got something to do? Only what any red-blooded young boy'd do his first night in town. Look for me where the lights are bright, and the music is gay. Come in. You the one who wanted the hot... Ooh, mister, honest. I can't put my hands up. Pour it in there. Yes, sir. It's a house rule. I bring the hot water, but you gotta dump the dirty water yourself. Sure. I didn't hear you knock. Good thing you didn't. Look, if it's about that shooting outside of Laramie... We don't know anything about Laramie. Just get out of that tub. Why? You're coming with us. That's a mighty poor answer. It'll have to do for now. Dry yourself off, get your clothes on. How about telling me where we're going? A ranch, on the outside of town, about 10 minutes away. There were three of them, you understand, and the middle one was kinda fat, so I said to the little one... Mister, I've seen lots of ranches. What's the matter? You know those men? I know three of them. They're businessmen here in town. So if you're what you say you are, you have nothing to worry about. Except how to prove it. I don't know the big one. I do. Who is he? He used to be a friend of mine. Let's go. Ah, come on, honey, let's forget it and have a good time. There's one of them, Mr. Grayson. Well, take some chairs, gentlemen. I reckon that "gentlemen" doesn't include me. That remains to be seen. Where's Pritchard? Checking on the other one. He'll be along. Ellen, if you'll excuse us, please. Of course. Come, Joan. Sit down, Bodie. Would you care for a drink? Can't really say. I only drink with friends. My name's Grayson. Among other things, I happen to be president of the Stockmen's Bank. I suppose you're wondering why you're here. No, I know why I'm here. Why? 'Cause I seldom wear a gun while I'm taking a bath. Mr. Bodie, I can assure you this is not a joking matter. Maybe you'd like to give me a better reason. This afternoon, you rode into town with a man named Pat Keogh. Is there a law against that? In these cases, we make our own laws. Hung many strangers lately? I told you this was not a joking matter. Then maybe you ought to tell me what I'm doing here. I assure you we're doing all this for a reason. How long have you known Pat Keogh? What difference does it make? Is he a friend of yours? I wouldn't call him an enemy. He saved me from looking up the short end of a rope. Would you care to explain the circumstances? I'd enjoy to. Four days ago, I was held up by three respectable citizens. Something like these three. They weren't the law, but they were going to put a rope around my neck for something I didn't do. Keogh kept them from hanging my hide up to dry. Does that answer your question? What else do you know about him? What else do I need to know? Now, if you'll excuse me... I wouldn't try to leave if I were you. Hello, Cheyenne. Pritch. It's been a long time, hasn't it? A long time and a long ride from here. You know these people? Yes. So long, Pritch. Look me up at the Palace Hotel, but knock before you come in. Stay a while. I don't like your friends. Did you ever know a lawman to have any friends? Least you didn't come in here with a gun in your back. That wasn't my idea. I'd hate to think it was. Take your hands off me, Pritch. Maybe this'll change his mind. Why don't you keep out of this? Looks like you've already waved that gun around too much. Cheyenne, you and I have known each other quite a while. Yeah. You can go if you want, but I'd like to have my say. All right. Tell the rest of them to stay out of it. I'm tired of being pushed around. That's fair enough. Do you know who Pat Keogh is? Yes, he's a friend of mine. He's the number-one criminal in this territory. We think he's responsible for at least half a dozen robberies in the past year. Robberies in which six men were shot. Four of them died. You sure it's Pat Keogh you want? Maybe not for all of them. The pattern is never the same. The man we're after covers a pretty wide area. Sometimes he works with confederates, sometimes alone. But one thing we do know. The operation is always carefully planned in advance. Keogh spent a few days here a couple of months ago. You still haven't answered my question. Are you sure Pat's your man? Positive? No. That's why you're here. Are you close enough to Keogh to get...? Good night, Pritch. Cheyenne, I know what I'm asking and I know how you feel, but Keogh is a cold-blooded killer. You can't turn us down. I have to. I have to treat him the same way he's treated me. As a friend. I can't turn on him for no reason. Mr. Bodie, we're prepared to offer a certain amount of money... You haven't got that much money. All right, Bodie, if that's your attitude, I suspect that your stay in Red Rock may not be too pleasant. You running me out of town? If you care to put it that way. Come to think about it, I can't see any good reason for staying. In case you change your mind, I'll be at the Palace, room 36. I think you're making a mistake, Mr. Pritchard. It's obvious he and Keogh are partners. His first act will be to warn him. Holding him here would have tipped our hand too. I've known Cheyenne a long time, but I've never known him to be outside the law. How long has it been since you last saw him? A year, maybe a year and a half. Yeah, people change. I'm not sure they do. ? Oh, I killed a man they say So they say ? ? Oh, I beat him on the head ? ? And I left him there For dead ? ? Yes, I left him there for dead ? ? Blast his eyes ? Oh, Mr. Keogh. Bartender, I'll buy a drink for the house. Drink up, boys, we've got a live one. How can he carry on like that with what we got coming up tomorrow? Pat don't ever think about what's coming up tomorrow. Don't you know that? How about another little drink? Oh, no, I don't think I should. Oh, drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake. Well, that's from the Bible. First Timothy, 5:3. But I didn't think you- Just want you to know you're in good company. Oh. Come on, have a little drink. Well, I guess it's all right. Oh, sure. Oh, there's your friend. Kind of handsome, isn't he? That's not quite the word I'd like to use for him. Do me a favor, honey. Go sit at another table while I talk to my friend. Oh, but I'd like to meet him. You will. Now, go on, will ya? Took you a long time to take a bath. Had a lot of dirt to get rid of. Where'd you come from just now, the stable? Sort of took the long way around. Thought you didn't know anybody in this town. Seems like somebody knew me. And you. It don't make much sense, does it? Anything makes sense when you've got three guns stuck in your ribs. What they want to know? Everything I knew about you. What'd you tell them? Nothing. I don't know anything outside of the fact that you threw in with me when I needed help. You put the gun away now, Pat. Okay, partner. Hey, Millie. Millie, meet my friend Cheyenne. It's my pleasure. Oh, mine too. Oh, come on, sit down, sit down. She thinks you're handsome. Oh, now, Pat. Think I'm going to argue with her? No. Never argue with a woman. ? As the blackbird In the spring ? ? 'Neath the willow tree ? ? Sang and piped I heard him sing ? ? Singing Aura Lee ? ? Aura Lee, Aura Lee... ? Bah. ? Maid with golden hair ? ? Sunshine came along With thee ? ? And swallows in the air ? Millie. Millie, I came to take you home. Don't think she wants to go. I think maybe she should. Who is this little fella? He's... He's been courtin' me. Can't win all the time. I don't like to lose. Come on, sit down, have a drink. No, thanks. Come on, Millie. Tom, please... Leave her alone. She's having a good time. Let her go, Pat. No. I'm an old-fashioned boy. I brought her here, I'm going to take her home. I don't think so, mister. Now, look, if you don't want a drink, get out. You're spoiling my evening. Mister, I don't want to fight with you. Why not? Not enough backbone? What do you want me to do? I'm not wearing a gun. Now you got a gun. All right, Tom. I'll go with you. No, you won't. Leave him alone, Pat. I'm not doing anything. I just don't think he's gonna take her home. 'Cause I don't think he's man enough. You don't want a weak-kneed calf like that. You want a man, like me. Tom! Tom! Oh, Tom! If you need witnesses, mister, you got two right here. We seen him draw first. Yeah, that's right. I don't think I'll need any. Coming, partner? Didn't have to kill him, Pat. He was trying to kill me, wasn't he? Did you give him any choice? Man doesn't know how to use a gun, he shouldn't try. What would you have done if it had been me? Same thing. Sure of that? Yeah, I'm sure. There's a difference between shooting at rocks and shooting at people. You see, shootin' to kill slows most men down. There's just a few of us it don't. That's why if we ever tried to shoot it out, I'd put you down. Yeah, maybe you would. Ah, what are we talkin' about? We're friends, aren't we? Oh. I, uh- I just happened to think. I never did finish that song. See you later. I've been waiting for you. What made you think I'd be here? I heard about the shooting. I was there. I know, that's why I was waiting. I guess that's the shortest friendship a man ever had. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. You mean, you've changed your mind? You know that already. This is something I'm not going to be proud of, but... I guess Keogh's got to be stopped. Why do you think I've spent a year trying to run him down? I'll play along with you, Pritch, but I don't know the others in this, so... let's keep it between us. All right. But don't take any chances with Keogh. He's dangerous. Get in with him. Find out why he's here. Ain't you up kinda late? What about yourself? Ran out of women. Small town. Why you all packed? I'm pulling out, Pat. Just waiting up to say goodbye. 'Cause of what happened down in the saloon? No. Well, then, why? By request. Man named Grayson suggested that this town might not agree with me. Never figured you for a fellow who'd run. All depends. It's easy to leave a place if you don't have a reason for stayin'. What if you had a reason? I could think about it. How'd you like to make some money? Big money. Fine, but that's not an easy thing to do. Why not? Where do people keep money? Well, I never owned any more than I could carry around in my pockets. But I understand some people keep it in banks. Well... We planning to hold up a bank? Not the way they got it figured. Or you either. I don't have anything figured. You don't have to. Get a good night's sleep, we got a big day tomorrow. Nice place, huh? Real nice. Ever see it before? Not in the daylight. Don't look so worried, Bart, he's with us. How's it going? Like a clock. Griggs left with the old lady 10 minutes ago. Get the horses out of sight. Grayson a friend of yours? I'm willing to like him, but I'm not so sure he'll be willing to like me. All right, Bodie, I'm forced to agree to any terms you might mention. Now, where's my wife? 'Fraid you'll have to ask my partner. Ah, your wife's all right, Mr. Grayson. She'll be all right as long as you do as you're told. I suppose you have a price. What is it? Fifty thousand dollars. Fifty thousand? I don't have that much money. Your bank has. Are you proposing that I loot my own bank? It's easier for you than it would be for me. You have the combination of the vaults. And what if I refuse? You won't. You see, your wife is with a friend of mine. If I don't show up by 5:00 this afternoon, he has orders to kill her. That's just in case you put a posse on our tail after you bring back the money. Besides, we have your daughter here. That's just to make sure you come back. Mr. Grayson. Better do the way he said. The money's unimportant, but if any harm comes to my daughter or my wife, I give you my word, you'll never know a safe night's sleep from now until you die. Because I'll be looking for you. And someday I'll find you. How's it feel to be rich? I haven't seen the money yet. He'll bring it. What about his wife? I never make a play I can't back up. ? Aura Lee, Aura Lee ? ? Maid with golden hair ? ? Sunshine came Along with thee ? ? And swallows in the air ? Oh, Mr. Grayson, I was just going up to the bank to see you. I wanted to tell you how- Oh, Pritchard, I-I haven't much time right now. I'll try and get in touch with you later. Going somewhere? Oh, just some papers I'm taking home to look over. You're going home kind of early, aren't you? Yes, I-I have a headache. Grayson, there's something wrong. What is it? Wrong? I-I just don't feel very well. This whole thing's got me upset, I guess. Did you know Keogh is missing? And the other two men that came in last Monday? I didn't know that, I suppose they've left town. Maybe. You know, Grayson, if you want me to help you, you've got to do everything you can to help me. I realize that. It's just that right now... Well, I've got something else on my mind. You'll have to excuse me. Wouldn't think it'd take a man this long to rob his own bank, would you? Maybe he changed his mind. He'll bring the money. Yeah, he'd better. You have this whole thing set up, Pat. Why'd you cut me in? I told you, friends are hard to come by. You got something good, you let your friends in on it. Friends? What would filth like you know about friendship? Well, she does have some spirit after all. I hope you're wrong. I hope my father doesn't bring you the money. You're dirty, you're rotten, you swine. Oh, now you're getting excited, honey. Why don't you just go in there and you can think of some names to call me in private? Pat. Thought we were partners? That's right. I saw her first. Thought all you did was take hot baths. Listen. Stay away from me. You've got to listen to me. Don't touch me. I'm not gonna... Cheyenne, I sort of hate to intrude, but Grayson's back. Don't feel too bad, honey, we might pass this way again. Turner, get the horses. Good to see you back. We were beginning to worry about your wife. Where's my daughter? She's all right, she's in there. Here's the money. I suppose you want to count it. No, I'll take your word for it. I think you're honest. I've lived up to my part of the bargain, now, would you take me to my wife? Oh, she'll be back some time tonight, after we're long gone. What assurance do I have of that? My word? Why should I take your word? Why not? I'm taking yours. Come on, let's go. Pritch. I followed Grayson. Why didn't you stop them before this? I couldn't, Pritch. They've got Mrs. Grayson. I don't know where. Got to string along with them till I find out where she is. Turner just bought himself some ground. How's he? He's not going to cause any trouble. Well, come on, let's get out of here. It's getting kind of late. Yeah. It's after 4:30. Nice watch, isn't it? Where did you get it? Turner was carrying it. He probably stole it from somebody. Hey, this is a good place to make camp, huh? Yeah, but we're supposed to meet Griggs and Mrs. Grayson before 5:00. That doesn't give us much time. Oh, we got all the time in the world. You're going to meet Griggs here? I'm not going to meet him at all. Griggs never did know anything about spending money. Besides, 50,000's hardly enough for two. What about Mrs. Grayson? What about her? You told Grayson that Griggs would kill her if we didn't show up by 5:00. Yeah, I'm afraid he'll do it too. I told him. Where is she, Pat? You're the only man I ever really took a liking to. The first one I was ever wrong about. It's a real shame. We both made the same mistake. I had you figured wrong too. Where's Mrs. Grayson? Were you in with Pritchard? Where's Grayson's wife? I'm not about to say. I'm just going to ask you one more time. Where is she? I'm a gambling man. Put the gun away and I'll tell you. You'll tell me now with a gun in my hand. Uh-uh. My way or nothing. Pat, I mean business. Where's Mrs. Grayson? I guess that's something you'll never find out, unless you're willing to gamble on it. Twenty-five minutes to 5. Got to hand it to Turner. If you're going to steal a watch, steal a good one. I won't hit your hat next time, Pat. You won't even shoot next time. 'Cause the way you figure, that would be like killing Grayson's wife. You do shoot real good, don't you. The next one will be that much closer. Twenty-four minutes to 5. It's a 20-minute ride from here. Throw me the watch. Don't drop it, it's liable to stop running. You got me figured right, Pat. I won't kill you now, but when 5:00 comes, as far as I'm concerned, Mrs. Grayson's dead... and so are you. We're partners, remember? If she dies, they'll hang you for it. That may be true, but you won't be around to see it. Twenty-three minutes, Pat. It won't work, partner. If you want to know where she is, put that gun away. That way she's at least got a chance. All right, Pat, you win. Where is she? On her way home. Griggs was a little squeamish about killing a woman. So I told him to hold her until 4:30 and then let her go. Anytime, partner, I'm waiting. But remember what I told you about the difference between rocks and people. I'm going to put you down. It's your game, Pat, you make the move. You're- You're full of surprises, aren't you, partner? I'm sorry, Pat. We might've- We might've been good friends, if things had been different. Yeah, we might have been. What's the answer? No difference between... me and a hunk of rock? I...guess I should've thought of that. I don't know what brought you back here, but just drop your gun before you start explaining. Mr. Grayson, is your wife home? Yes, the doctor's with her. She's all right. It's Keogh. The money's in here. Wait a minute, Bodie. Pritchard was killed here today. You think bringing Keogh in makes your skirts all clean? Pritchard was a friend of mine. I happen to have been working with him. Can you prove that? No. I'm afraid you'll have to prove it. Listen, mister, I lost two friends today. One of them I had to kill myself. Now, I'm going to ride out of here, I hope you have the sense to put that gun away and stay quiet. I wonder if he was telling the truth. I guess we'll never know.
