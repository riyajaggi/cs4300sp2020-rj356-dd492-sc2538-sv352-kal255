 Welcome to my world. Two escargot, pate, frisee, two green salads. OK, line these up here. Lamb chop, steak frites-- shouldn't you be doing something? Two smoked fillet and a pepper steak. Come on. Make the dessert. Chocolate tart, please. As a cook, tastes and smells are my memories. Now I'm in search of new ones.

 So I'm leaving New York City, and hope to have a few epiphanies around the world. And I'm willing to go to some lengths to do that. I am looking for extremes of emotion and experience. I'll try anything. I'll risk everything. I have nothing to lose. Vietnam has intoxicating beauty that extends far beyond the urban setting up. Today I'm off to explore the countryside. My good friend Philippe Lajaunie pulled in semi-unexpectedly last night. We're ready for our adventure. This is it.

 We're off on our next leg. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: We are travelling south from Ho Chi Minh City, heading into the Mekong Delta, the rice basket of Vietnam, to explore river life and its cuisine. Philippe is a consummate gourmand. And I say that with the utmost respect. Philippe loves food. I don't think there's anything in this world that he wouldn't eat. Oh, just half is good. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: He gets me into a lot of trouble. But it's always a lot of fun. Good. The best. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: We're cruising down highway one, on our way to the southern city of Can Tho, about a six hour journey. We make a few pit stops. A bit of a jam up on the road. Clearly black was not a sensible fashion selection. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: The terrain is pancake flat an deliriously green. Martha Stewart does this stuff. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Can Tho, this is the Vietnam I've seen in movies-- the scenery, the pace, the river life. The air is fresh for being in the middle of the land here Are we going? ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: This morning, we're slipping out onto the mighty Mekong River for a little breakfast. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I think a bowl of extremely spicy pho might hook me up. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: When you're on a river in Vietnam, you get a real sense of the industriousness, the use of space, the engineering skills. It's almost an entirely waterborne existence. Check the gas station out. Slightly combustible, you think? It's like a floating bomb, man. And I'll bet you $100, the guy who pilots that little buggy, I bet you he smokes like a find. There it is. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Cai Rang is the largest floating market in the Mekong Delta. From fish to fruit to flowers, it's all here being bought and sold. Look at this. This is unbelievable. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I'm constantly impressed. How do they do it? With boats that seem barely seaworthy, not only do they float, but you can run a business out of the thing. They're are little snack boats floating around with prepared foods catering, to the merchants who work here. If you want a cup of coffee, you call the coffee boat over. Having a little floating Starbucks over here. I'll have a double latte mochaccino, please. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Starbucks really is in trouble. Because look at this coffee operation. They've got it all, right there. Very cool. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Absolutely steaming hot wonderful coffee, delivered right in the middle of the river. It's great. I can't tell you [BLEEP] at Starbucks. Thank you, my friend. Thank you, kind sir. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: After a cup of coffee, perhaps a traditional Vietnamese breakfast-- a nice, steaming hot bowl of pho. A little noodle soup. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Beef broth, beef, noodles, cilantro, bean sprouts, chopped red chilies, and a squeeze of lemon. I'm rethinking my morning Cap'n Crunch ritual. This is the best. The flavors are so, so good. It's the true home cooking. Baguette lady is here. They make [INAUDIBLE] baguettes in this country, man. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Baguettes are one of the better contributions of the French occupation of Vietnam. Despite the humidity, the baguettes are remarkably fresh, with crackling crust and tender insides. I've eaten some of the best baguettes I've ever had in Vietnam. It feels quite wonderful to get up in the morning, to get onto a boat, sail off to a market. It's great. This is the life. I could go to a market by boat every morning like this. Yeah. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I could float around here all day. But this water junket continues. All right. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: We've got a date with a duck somewhere up the river. No more roads from here. It's get into a long boat, put put up a narrow canal, deep, deep, deep into the delta. Everything is laid out her so precise, that every little ladder, every little walkway. Very efficient, very smart. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: We are to be the guests of a gentleman farmer called Uncle Hai, who is going to make us a very traditional meal. Jimi Hendrix in the background. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: The first thing we hear is the feedback of an electric guitar-- rather incongruous, considering where we are. It sounded like some experimental jazz. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: There we are in the very simple country home of Uncle Hai and his extended family. He's got a few kids in there playing electric guitar, noodling away on an ancient Fender Mustang. [PLAYING GUITAR] Did good. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: So were greeted with tea, and a plate pear-shaped fruits called water apples. It's kind of South. Very crunchy, a lot of fiber. I can't wait to meet the duck. There's our victim. Sorry, fella. No, victims. It's for a noble cause there. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: This is a traditional recipe, created by workers in the rice paddies using resources readily available. You have ducks. You have clay. And you have kindling wood to build a fire. And the tradition continues. Really, as we'd say in French cuisine, this is very old school. The duck is killed first, then wrapped entirely in clay, innards and all. And then it's placed on the fire. Barbecue is so last year. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Very, very simple food. Not a lot of technique here. Like a beautiful family experience. There's five people working on this. You got the whole family involved. Five or six people were working on the actual duck. This is an event. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: All of the people from miles around seem to be some part of Uncle Hai's extended family-- some of them incredible faces and incredible characters. As we wait for our duck to cook, more of them keep arriving. This is grilling and chillin'. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Can Tho is a beautiful city in the delta. [ROOSTER CROWING] ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: An agricultural community rooted in hard work and physical labor. It's farm country. [PIG SQUEALING] ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: And I think every farmer in the delta has come out for Uncle Hai's duck in clay. Here we go. You know, palm fronds. The flavors must be absolutely exquisite. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I can tell from the look on Philippe's face, he's thinking new restaurant-- Chez Duck in Clay, maybe New York, maybe South Beach. My mind is racing right now, trying to imagine how to do that in New York. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: All right. This is smart. When the clay is broken off, the feathers come with it. That is pretty cool. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: When dinner's ready, they lay a tarpaulin out on the front lawn. We all squat down, and they bring out the duck for me to carve. All right. Here's the duck here. Wow, look at this. I recognize him. They will turn him over first. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Keep in mind there's no cutlery. There are no napkins. It looks like I'm wrestling with the duck. Before he was chef he was surgeon. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: But I managed to get the legs off and the breast in fairly good tableside style, considering I've got a plate the size of a Chiclet. First, I need another plate to put this. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I don't know if that's how they usually cut it. They'll probably be talking about this for a while. OK, now here we're getting to the good stuff. This is it. Oh yes. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: This duck was definitely cooked without draining the blood or removing the innards. There's the blood in there. It's true. This is one of the best cooked duck I ever seen. Wow, OK, bravo. This looks delicious. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: The clay cooking method keeps it tender, and gives it a smoky flavor. So good. The flavors here are so wonderful. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Pieces of duck meat, the dismantled carcass, and all else that remains becomes part of an incredible duck and banana blossom soup. Rich in texture, strong in taste-- it's real hearty. It's enough to feed the whole crowd. The smell is just extraordinary. There we go. Very rich. That's cooked for quite a few hours. Just remarkable. It's beautiful stew right there. It's so good to be here. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: The deadly Mekong Delta moonshine, which comes out in two cola bottles, this is rice whiskey, the local homebrew, kind of like white lightning. Oh, that's good. Here's looking at you, man. Lot of strength there. Wow. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: This stuff is dangerous. There we go. Down to the stomach, and going up to the head. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: And it's even more dangerous when you're the lone American guest of honor. You're something of an attraction. They all want to share a shot with the American. Cheers. Cheers. I'm honored. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Some of them want to see how much the American can drink, and if he could make as much as them. The guy who gives me the most trouble, though, is the one directly across from me. He looks as if he's 98 years old. He's blind in one eye. He has no teeth. And he can drink me under the table. This gentleman here, I like him. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: OK, one more shot. So I must have had 13 or 14 of these things. And I'm dying at this point, and so is Philippe. [INAUDIBLE] in about two seconds. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: It's an extraordinary experience that just gets better and better and more intoxicating as the night goes on. That's it. I've had enough. I have no question in my mind that he is the stronger man. There we go. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: And as it's dark, with a single light bulb, you know you're deep, deep, deep in the bush. There's a singular, riveting, beautiful moment during this whole meal. A man sings a heartbreakingly earnest song. [SINGING IN VIETNAMESE] ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: It's absolutely enchanting. Looking over at the glazed look on Philippe's face, I suspect he is similarly affected. [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] There is everything here, all the senses-- beauty, the sweetness of the air, the food. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: My belly is full. My head is swimming. Somebody take me to the river. Tomorrow, Philippe's off to New York. And I'm heading north to the beaches for some seafood. But this is a night I will not soon forget. I've traveled from Can Tho to Nha Trang, a sleepy fishing community on Vietnam's South Central Coast. Life is very different up here. Little oyster village where I had my first oysters a lot feels a lot like this. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: We're going to see a culture that revolves around the sea and seafood. You know you're in the tropics when you're here. I say it's safe to surf this beach. It's safe to surf this beach. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I'm at the beach, so I'm automatically happy. I smell salt. I feel sand. And I see the surf. Surf is up. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: So after kicking around in the ocean, I'm ready for some food. I heard about this cool floating dock, where you pick your lunch straight out of the water. And fisherwomen are going to shuttle me there. 114th Street and Riverside Drive, please. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I finally get to ride in one of those round boats. It's essentially woven strands of bamboo covered with tar, surprisingly seaworthy. I like these women a lot. They have a lot of fun with the tourists. And then one of those bonding moments happen when a gentleman disembarks from my boat. When he gets out onto the dock, he stumbles badly, and almost falls into the water. And the two ladies with me crack up. We don't speak the same language. But we all know what we're laughing about. There's a shared joyous moment. Now this isn't like that skunky aquarium at your local fish joint. This is fresh, fresh, fresh. Somebody feels like squid? ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: It's all stuff they hauled in that day. You just reach in. There are lobsters, kind of like the clawless spiny lobster of the Mediterranean. Incredible looking crabs, a variety of fish still swimming around, everything still alive. I don't think I can eat all of that. OK, maybe one of these. A nice, big lobster. OK, take this guy. Lunch. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: OK, this may look like we're sitting down for a typical lobster meal. But we don't do this in the states. Jam a knife into the lobster's sexual organs. That's gotta hurt. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Drain what is referred to as blood, which is then poured into Hanoi vodka. Cool. I could get into this big time. And of course it's going to make me strong and feel good. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: The Vietnamese believe that drinking animal blood makes you more potent. It tastes kind of like sour milk and vodka. Yeah, strong. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: It makes you feel strong enough to tuck in to a serious seafood meal. Most of the kitchens in Nha Trang are rudimentary at best. But the seafood is always first rate. Recognize him? We've been seeing a lot of that cradle to the grave food here. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: This is not Red Lobster. There's no butter here. Now we're tucking in, with a little pepper loosened up into a paste with some fresh lime juice. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: This is fried grouper, finished with a spicy red chili sauce. This is how the pros do it. Good stuff. Oh man, that's criminally good. Pass it down. Almost all the tables you see large group, six, eight, ten people, all eating together. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Locals and tourists, whole families, everybody's tucking in like there's no tomorrow. You make a mess. You tunnel after every good piece. It's fun. All the big tables look like this afterwards. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: It looks like Stalingrad after the war, with the shells sucked clean, picked over bones, stubbed out cigarettes, discarded bottles. Evidence of a good time. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Detritus of an invading army left on the table. Everybody wins. That's what's great. Except the lobster, he loses. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I'm staying at the former summer retreat of the last Vietnamese emperor, Bao Dai. He may be gone. But one of his royal dishes remains-- the much sought after bird's nest soup. The soup contains hardened strands of bird mucus, which sea swallows use to make their nests. It's believed to be an elixir of youth. Choking down a bowl of mucus isn't something I'm thrilled about doing, since I still have that lobster swimming around in my stomach. You know, I'm bloated. I feel like Orson Welles. But the chef has been working on this all day. So I have to extend some professional courtesy, and rise to the occasion. What was Emperor Bao Dai thinking, eating this stuff? Maybe if he'd eaten more at Sizzler and less bird's nest he would still be in power. Nest harvesting is a precarious venture. Harvesters rappel down rock faces to reach the nest, steering clear of the poisonous snakes. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Not to be taken lightly, the highly prized bird's nest, which is no bigger than a child's hand, is rare and difficult to obtain. The motivation for risking life and limb is the high return on this. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: It can fetch up to $4,000 a pound. Slight incline. But believe me, it feels like Kilimanjaro to me. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Fortunately, I won't be choking down bird's mucus right away. Bird's nest soup involves a lengthy preparation. So here's how this royal dish breaks down. A swallow's nest, quail eggs, rock doves, medicinal herbs, and a coconut. First, drain the juice. Separate the strands of the bird's nest. Hard cook and peel eggs. Chop rock doves. Season with salt, pepper, shallots, ginger. Soak the medicinal elements-- wolf berry, lotus root, and silver ear mushrooms. Pack all the ingredients into coconut. Add back the juice as a base for the broth. Then steam for five hours. Birds nest soup is highly revered as traditional Chinese medicine. Maybe this stuff will work. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Because it cures God knows what. My lungs will clear up. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Because it makes you strong. No problem exercising. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: And because it has therapeutic and restorative qualities. Give me that clear porcelain complexion I always dreamed of. This could usher in a whole new period of my life. This could be a good thing. Thank you. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Ah, bird's nest. OK, so the strands of mucus taste like overcooked angel hair. Actually, it doesn't taste bad. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: And the broth is pretty good too. Sort of sweet and sour. OK, so far so good. It's the chunks I'm wary of. I don't want to know what that is. Please, God, let it be a chickpea. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: It tastes like one of those Chinese herbs, a little bitter. I can live with this. I'm relieved. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: So I'm getting past the mucus aspect, and all the chunks. I'm thinking I'm home free. So you can imagine my surprise while tunneling through this stuff to see head and beak come popping out at me. That's our little friend. Oh yeah, I recognize him. That looks like a collar bone. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I knew they used rock dove, but the whole thing? It's like something out of "Evil Dead." That's a real capper. The broth was the best part. And the nest wasn't that bad after all. But I wasn't feeling too good after this stuff. It did not make me feel stronger. I just feel utterly horrible. How do you say bromo-seltzer in Vietnamese? ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: It made me want to die. The horror, the horror. Never mind my moaning. I've been completely seduced by the Vietnamese cuisine, and the life that surrounds it.
