 Welcome to my world. [THEME MUSIC] Two escargot, ponte, frisee. Two green salads. OK, line this up here. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): Lamb chop, steak-frites. Shouldn't you be doing something? Two full filet and a pepper steak. Come on, make the dessert. Chocolate tart, please. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: As a cook,

 tastes and smells are my memories. And now I'm in search of new ones. So I'm leaving New York City and hope to have a few epiphanies around the world, and I'm willing to go to some lengths to do that. I am looking for extremes of emotion and experience. I'll try anything. I'll risk everything. I have nothing to lose. [MUSIC PLAYING] Tiny, tiny little menu. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Now, a sensible chef doing world tour would probably go straight to Paris, hugely popular center of great food.

 But my center of food has always been Arcachon. So I'm catching a train to France's southwest coast, just outside of Bordeaux. My father's side of the family were French, and generations of Bourdains are from Arcachon. I haven't been there in 20 years. I'm go back to the ancestral homeland. Hopefully there will be some reminiscences, and maybe we'll discover some things along the way. I'm really looking forward to it. Of all of the places that I'm going, of all the places I've been, I'm really excited about this one. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Arcachon-- my father loved this town. It's where he spent much of his youth. He imparted the spirit of this place to my brother and me, and it's where we spent many happy summers as a family. It's where I crept up on adolescence-- [LAUGHTER OF CHILDREN] ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: --where I had my first and most important food experience. I have powerful memories of the taste of murky, brown fish soup at the local joint, the taste of saucisson a l'ail, the smell of Gitanes cigarettes. Those summers played an important part of who I am today. So I want to go back and try all of those things. I want to relive those moments. My father's long since passed away, so it's my way of reconnecting with whatever sense of family and tradition I have. Arcachon is located on the southern tip of Arcachon Bay, which spills out into the Atlantic Ocean. It's sort of the Jersey Shore of France, where working families vacation. The main trade year round is oyster harvesting. Cool. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I no longer have any relatives here. But I'm hooking up with my younger brother, Chris. He was my partner in crime during those memorable summers. We're going to take this trip down memory lane together, but I've some time to kill before he gets here. Snack time. Above and beyond, you know, being the ancestral homeland, I cook all of this stuff. This is the food that I first learned to love and to eat. You know, French cuisine, I mean, that's in the bone, man. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I'm a chef of a French brasserie in New York. So for my first meal in town, I'm looking for the authentic and the familiar, some classic brasserie chow, steak-frites. OK, we're here. I can hear my steak going on the grill in the kitchen. [SIZZLE] This is sort of like the French version of, you know, Joe's Diner. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: This is the sort of place I am very familiar with. Basically, it's beer, bread, steak, and french fries. Merci beaucoup. WAITER (OFFSCREEN): Bon appetite. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): Oh, yes. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: This is a bavette, a typical cut of beef for steak-frites, grilled with shallots. This is my first culinary experience back in France in 20 years. And it's exactly right. It's just what I wanted to tuck into. I'm very grateful they didn't ask if I wanted ketchup. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: So this is a good halfway house for someone taking a sentimental journey back into the France of their youth. I'm not plunged immediately back into my past. I'm easing back. It's a great, comfortable first meal in town. Merci, Monsieur. Au revoir. Au revoir. Yeah, now I'm good. I'm home, baby. I really want waffles. I should probably do that with my brother, though. That was a big thing when we were kids. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: My brother's like me. He lives in New York and has a family there. I'm supposed to meet him at the train station, but I run into him on the street. [LAUGHTER] You just walking around? What are you doing? - Yeah. - What's up? Hello. When did you blow into town? We just got in. Oh, yeah. Have you eaten yet? I had, like, a little snack, but, uh-- Maybe a waffle? We could hit a-- I saw there's a gaufre over there. Oh, yeah. Let's do it. I think I saw it over there. Let me ask you this. Do you get an electric buzz when you, like, get off the train and you start seeing the familiar words like [FRENCH] jambon, beignet, boisson? Oh yeah. In fact I did see the [INAUDIBLE jambon over by the station. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: My brother and I haven't been together in Arcachon in 25 years. And of course, the first thing we go for is something we were discouraged to eat as kids, sweets. And what do we have here, what kind of gaufre? Deux gaufres, s'il vous plait. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: When we were kids, only if we'd been good could we get a treat. If we could score a gaufre, a waffle, we were golden. So a gaufre was a sweet, hot, crusty, wonderful treat. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): (SINGING) Memories, da, da, da, da. You know, it's magic, you know, but that's because I have happy memories of long ago, far away, exotic places in mind when I bite into it. But we'll see. Maybe they taste different. Let's see. I think it's something about they're warm and the confectioners sugar and all that stuff. Yeah, cool. That's great. [LAUGHTER] ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I think if my mother could see us now, tucking into waffles with wild abandon, she's be horrified. All right. CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): These are great. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: We're heading to La Teste, a short, five-minute train ride. We're going to check out our childhood house and the local food joints. Look at us, my brother and me. I'm 44. He's 42. We've gone far away to France. Everything's changed, but I hope to find that some things remain the same. Look at this. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): I'll tell you, if that's a Hard Rock Cafe, I'm going to be really pissed off. CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): Oh, god. I'm nervous. Who would have thought we'd do something this goofy? CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): Who says it's goofy? What? ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Our first stop is the house that our father's aunt owned. It no longer belongs to the family. But there's a picture I look at often, of my brother and I in our silly little French short shorts, and we're wearing berets, standing in front of the gate in this house. I want to see that space. Can you remember the direction? It was this way. Yeah. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I remember La Teste as a quaint little oyster village. And as soon as we make our way to our old home, it seems that time has left this town untouched. CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): The town has not changed a drop. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): Nope. It looks exactly the same so far. Yeah. No, it's great. Those two there are, like, classic pinasse oyster boats. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): Well actually, that's exactly like what we used to go out on. CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): Yeah. We go this way, [FRENCH]-- yeah, the fire station. Hey, remember we had a well just like that one? ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, exactly. So we're right on our block. Like it's across the street there. Yeah, I think it's, like down-- down just across here. We're very-- very, very close. This is so weird. I'm getting chills, man. OK, so it's number five. CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): Number five, exactly. There was a gate right here. But it was something low, wooden. And in fact, this is where we-- this was where the famous picture was taken. That's right. [DOG BARKING] CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, and then they put in this whole thing here. That's not changed at all. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): And the gardens in the back all look the-- that little dining area in the back where we used to eat. That was your room for a while, and I was across the hall in a back room. And Gustave and Tante Jeanne were in the back. And their 125-watt light bulb they used to light the entire place. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: The current owner, Monsieur Lestingnon, kindly let's us in to look around. I just want to see the garden where I used to drink Kronenbourg and eat oysters. Fantastic. It's fantastic. It looks exactly the same. Right here, buying my first bag of oysters, I learned how to crack oyster right here. Buy, like, a six pack of Kronenbourg and stash them in there. Just in here, and many happy lunches right there. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: That's where my Tante Jeanne made wonderful fresh tomato salad with vinaigrette, shallots, and parsley. You know, it was the first vegetables I liked. I was six. Oh, it's incredible. So Chris, the pump used to be here, the hand crank pump. Mmm-hmm, yeah. That's right. I wonder if there's still little plastic army buried in there somewhere. Probably. Ah, memories. Ah, man, this is too much. Eh, well, should we check out the neighborhood joints. CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): Sure, man? [SPEAKING_FRENCH] - Merci, Monsieur. - Au revoir, Monsieur. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Before we leave, we have to do one more thing. [CAMERA CLICK] So actually, if we walk this way and up, we'll hit where the [FRENCH], where the boulangerie was. - Yeah, it was right ahead. - That part of that main drag. Just, like a couple blocks past the school. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: This very bakery is where we'd get breakfast every morning. CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): Bonjour, Madame. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): I mean, I haven't smelled this in 20 years. [SPEAKING_FRENCH]. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: We order baguettes and raisin - bread. - Au revoir. Au revoir, merci. OK, here we go. Recipe unchanged in 20 years. It's great. Absolutely. There's a slight, like, aftertaste that says, right here, you know? Mmm-hmm, absolutely. I remember I'd dive for these things every day. Magic-- it's the best. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: This raisin bread is definitely bringing me back. All right. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: But I've got a special place in mind that's right around the corner. Bascially, if we were too lazy to make dinner and we couldn't agree on where we we're going to eat and what we're going to do and all the rest, we'd go around the corner and eat at, basically, the neighborhood joint. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: It's called Le Bistro now, exactly the sort of place that people in this neighborhood have been eating forever and ever. It was very convenient. It was very cheap. But what really drew us back time and time again was their fish soup. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): Soupe du pecheur-- we're there. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: The restaurant has definitely been dressed up. It was rattier. It was rattier. Yeah. And I seem to remember, like, some gaping cracks and holes and maybe a peeling poster, perhaps. It was as basic as you come. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I hope the fish soup hasn't lost its authenticity. It was the best kind of soul food. Merci. Here they call it fisherman's soup now, le soupe due pecheur. I guess I was impressed by its relative complexity and strangeness. It was kind of exotic, yeah. It was murky. It was brown. It was scary looking. I really loved that stuff. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: As soon as I started cooking professionally, it was one of the first things I put my repertoire. It's basically fresh fish of the day, shredded and reduced to an oily, gritty broth with the liquoricey hint of Pernod and anise seed, garnished with parsley. Of course, I never got it to taste like it did here. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): It looks great. Merci. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: The soup even comes with the same assortment of condiments-- This is exactly right. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: croutons, Gruyere cheese, and a garlic and pepper mayonnaise. These traditional garnishes give the soup its richer, hearty flavor. That's wonderful. Mmm, that's just great. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: So even though this place is more upscale, the soup is just as I remember it. OK, this place is not changed in all the important ways. It's beautiful. This is the best. Good to be here with you. CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): To us. Chris, I could not be happier. Right now, I could not be happier than at this moment. MAN (OFFSCREEN): Bonjour, Monsieur. Bonjour. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I'll never forget my first oyster. It was the summer of 1965. It came from a day trip on a pinasse, the little oyster boat of my neighbor, Monsieur Sanjour. He took the whole family out. We went out early, early in the morning, still dark. We waited for the tides of the bassin to go out. This was when Monsieur Sanjour offered me that first oyster, and I slurped it down to the shock and horror of my family. It was a defining moment for me. So my brother and I are back. We joined two oyster fisherman, Dominic and Jerome, to check out their typical work day and maybe hit them up for an oyster. But as with so many things in this trip back to France, so much is the same, and much is different. The oyster parks are larger, more spread out. In fact, their property extends as far as the eye can see. [SPEAKING_FRENCH] I have no idea how they can tell where the limit is, but they say they know. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Today, these guys are checking on their two-year-old baby oysters. All of these little platforms here are baby oysters in sort of like a permeable sack. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: This allows the water to pass through. It protects them from predators. The ones that we're bringing with us today are going to go into shore, get sorted over. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: They'll be sorted for size and quality. Tomorrow, they'll be placed back in deeper water for the nutrients they need. It'll be another year until these oysters will be hitting restaurants everywhere. I don't know how he's doing it in, like, the rolled up shirt. I'm freezing my butt off in this thing. I'm wrapped up like the Michelin tire man. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Did I mention it's the dead of winter? This, as you can see, is a tough business. Pull in a couple of tons to make the trip worthwhile. I mean, I remember the first time we came out here. It was a fairly leisurely activity. Of course, we had the advantage of doing it in the summer as well. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I also remember the water was shallower. We were walking around on dry land. We'd sit here for a few hours. The boat would go down, rest on the bottom. You know, we almost had a picnic of it, walking around, raking oysters. Yeah, just about. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: A lot has changed since my first oyster out here, and it looks like I won't get to eat one fresh out of the water. But in truth, that was a once in a lifetime experience. This is my most triumphant moment of my childhood. Like there was that wonderful moment of silence. Everybody seemed to shrink back a little. And I just see this glistening, sexual looking object, and I thought, OK, I can do this, just one bite, one slurp. Boom, I did it. And I felt like king of the world. I guess it was that moment that I first started to think about food as something with power. It sure caused a reaction of you. You looked like you were going to turn green and pitch over the edge. Yeah, well yeah. - I like them now. - You've eaten them now. But they're gross, you know. I thought it was gross. I've been looking to shock and horrified and impress ever since. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Here's a lascivious fact that would have made us giddy as kids. Oysters change sex every year. So Chris, how do they make oyster babies? The females spew out millions of eggs into the water, and the males just spew out sperm. And it all just mixes around like some big soup. So like a pool at Club Med. CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): It's absolutely a cesspool of sexual activity going on out here. So if you were to tell an oyster to go [BLEEP] yourself, that would not be an insult. [LAUGHTER] Some might argue that the oyster is the perfect food. It provides it's own sauce, requires no cooking, requires no shaping or sculpting, and it's hard to imagine improving upon nature. This is where they come from. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Dominic and Jerome have offered a tasting of their oysters back at their shack. And after 28 years, I wonder if they're going to taste the same. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): Oysters, for breakfast, babe. OK, moment of truth. MAN (OFFSCREEN): Voila. Merci. CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): All righty. Go ahead, do it. Mmm. Ah, amazing. [SPEAKING_FRENCH]? Superbe. The liquor and the salt water-- the oyster liquor is the best part. It's essential. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Arcachon oysters do taste just like they did-- brine, flesh, seawater, sense memory. Eating fresh oysters, right out of the water in an oyster shack. What's better than this? Cheers. This is really great. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I realize eating these oysters is as close I'll get to stepping into a time machine. But Chris and I have one last stop before our adventure ends. First, we need to shop for some cured meats. This looks lovely. Ooh, ask him-- Is there some kind of-- Oui, oui, oui, oui. Oui. CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): Ca va bien, yes? Oui. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: We're ordering cuts of ham, the house pate, and an assortment of sausages. But what I'm really going for is saucisson a l'ail or pork sausage with garlic. Saucisson? WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Sauci a l'ail. Ah, a l'ail. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: It was my father's favorite. [SPEAKING_FRENCH] WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): [SPEAKING FRENCH]. [SPEAKING_FRENCH]. Au revoir. Au revoir, monsieurs. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: We're stocked up on the essentials, so we're off to Cap Ferret on the northern coast of the Bassin d'Arcachon. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): This thing's got juice, man. OK, let's ride. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: So what we thinking, riding scooters all the way around the bay in the dead of winter just to reach a desolate, cold, windy beach? It's an insane venture. But hey, cruising around like this, I'm starting to feel 16 again. Hey, let's go terrorize the town folk. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: Frostbitten to the bone, we finally make it to Cap Ferret. Let's hit the beach. Let's go. Of course, I remember this as the best Atlantic beach I've ever been on. Oh yeah, me, too. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: We'd come out here, the whole family. We'd sit on the beach, swim, hang out, munch sandwiches. I remember my father's look of perfect happiness on the beach at Cap Ferret, his digging into his sausage, maybe some cheap red wine, a nice, fresh baguette. He knew exactly how to enjoy himself. Want to head up that way. Yeah. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: But when Chris and I got tired of the beach, we'd head towards one of the many Nazi blockhouses where we used to play as kids. These block houses were part of what was called the Atlantic Wall that the Germans built as a defensive measure during their occupation of France in World War II. Hey, maybe we'll hit a land mine. Oh, yeah. Or some unexploded shells. I remember there was one with the door in the side like that. Yes. This was a wild and great beach, but this hasn't changed at all. [INAUDIBLE]. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: This is a great place to settle in for a picnic. We'd lay out our usual assortment of local red wine, a bottle of Vittel, an assortment of stinky cheese and picnic meats. The first thing my brother I go for is saucisson a l'ail or garlic sausage. ANTHONY BOURDAIN (OFFSCREEN): I remember this well. It's a sausage more than anything else, right? That's the taste of summers past. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: When you're a little kid and you grow up playing army like we did, with little plastic army men, you imagine battlefields in miniature. So when we came here for the first time, this is what battlefields in the movies looked like, speaking with funny accents. I mean, it's not Normandy here, but you could still kind of have a fun time envisioning D-Day right here. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: But why leave it to the imagination? We brought along our own stash of ordnance. We're older and more mature now. (LAUGHING) We're more mature now. Oh, very-- My eye. Fire in the hole. [BANG] Damn, we didn't get those when we were kids. CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): No, no. Hee hee. Get in that hole, corporal. Come on. Fire in the hole. [BANG] CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): That was a good one. OK, I'm going to light it. We're going to run right over there, and we're going to take cover behind the line. Run away. [BOOM] CHRIS (OFFSCREEN): Good one. Outstanding, corporal. Oh, it's excellent. We got the bastards. All right. I'm glad we made it, man. Wouldn't have missed it. I'm really glad we got a chance to do this. Me, too. ANTHONY BOURDAIN NARRATING: I know that my brother and I are old now, that things can't be the same, that it's been 30 years. Things change. Things move on. One can't recapture the past. So one can go through the motions, and one can feel it. But not matter how wonderful, one cannot revisit the past. One cannot be nine years old again. Later, talking about it with Chris, we realized that perhaps we were looking for my father the whole time. We had a very nice moment of realization, how badly we missed my dad and how much he would have loved the idea of us throwing firecrackers inside a block house at Cap Ferret. Dad would have loved this. He would have just loved the idea of it alone. He would love the idea. He would have loved knowing about it. -Yeah. Yeah. [THEME MUSIC]
