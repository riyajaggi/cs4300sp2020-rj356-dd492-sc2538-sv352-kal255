 NETFLIX PRESENTS HAPPY DIVORCE Police! Ladies, the party is over! Go to the back. - Quickly. - Come on! Get out of there. - Come on, keep it moving. - We don't have all night. Hurry up! Go to the back. To the back. All the way! Come on, keep it moving.

 Whose party is this? I asked whose party this is. It's mine. Sit down. - Why? - I said sit down. What's going on? We didn't do anything wrong. Imagine your greatest desires; sex, parties, money... I have all of that. My name is Hugo Beltrán and I'm a stripper. SEVEN YEARS LATER Dolores. How are you? This has to go to courtroom three, okay? Thanks. - May I? - Triana, come in.

 So, what's the verdict? - We won! - Congratulations. You won. Great. Good job. Grab a chair and sit down. As you know, new evidence has made the embezzlement case more complicated. I want the junior associates to work with Lazaro's team. At this rate we can charge at least double. Am I also part of the team? No, you'll be taking on a pro bono case. The case is Hugo Beltrán, a male prostitute from Marbella. Doesn't that sound weird? Did you know that there are many words to call a woman a "whore"? But there aren't any other words for men, aside from male prostitute. Unless you count the Italian word gigolo. Marbella gigolo sentenced to 15 years for murder. The victim is Philip Norman, the husband of his client/lover. She, Macarena Medina, belongs to a very influential family. They're like the Kennedys of that area. He beheaded him? Yes, it's quite the case. He's been locked up for seven years, his previous counsel was shit. Keep me updated, okay? - Of course. - All right. That will be all. Ladies and gentlemen, let's get to work. Very well. - Are you coming with me? - Yes. Thank you. POLICE RECORD I'm Triana Marín, we spoke on the phone. As I explained before, I belong to the law firm Duarte and Associates, and if it's all right with you I'll be taking over your case. Why? I have no money. Don't worry, you won't have to pay. This case would be pro bono. What does that mean? The firm won't bill you. It's like... charity. And why would you do that? It helps our image; makes us look good. Well, lucky me, huh? Yes. I've been looking over your case, and we have grounds to solicit parole and reopen the case. That's nice. Sign at the bottom, if you accept. Well, I don't have anything planned for the next eight years. Look... I'm going to work my ass off to get you out of here, but not for you or for charity. I want to impress my boss, so she'll finally give me a good case. And for that, I need you to trust me. Do we have a deal? Before we begin, are you okay here? Do you need anything? I haven't needed anything in years. In that case, we have much to discuss. Quiet, quiet. Listen up, pretty ladies. It's the moment of truth. I want to see the money! Let me see it! Where is it? Do you want to go for a spin, honeybun? I missed you. Hey, guys, I can't work tonight. What do you mean you can't? - I can't. - What? Are you ditching us? No, but Jairo can cover for me, he's not working tonight. Asshole, don't be a dick. He's not being a dick, man. But you can't bail on us a few hours before work, brother. That's not cool. I've made up my mind, I'm not going. Forget it. I'm sure it's because of that slut. - Don't call her that, don't be an asshole. - What, you think she cares about you? Check this out, bro. That's right, take a good look, I know you like these. Three thousand bucks, man. How about that? We'll see what happens when she gets tired of you and dumps your ass. - I'm telling you. - This ain't gonna end well, you know that? - Right. - So, where's the gig tonight? - Hello. - Hi, how can I help you? I'm not sure. No, no, cancel everything for today; cancel everything. I can't make it today, okay? Okay, sure. Bye. What are we doing here? I need to have fun tonight and not think of anything else. Good morning. Good morning. I need a suit for him. Show me what you have. I'm sure anything will look good on him. Hey, don't get excited, I'm the one paying. - You're not going to answer? - No, it's Philip. I won't allow him to sour my evening. Why are you still with him if you're not happy? - Thank you. - No, thanks. Divorce him and come with me. I do love you. You're so cute. Cute? You treat me like a pet. What am I to you, Macarena? This is not part of the deal, Hugo. I never said I loved you. I know you've never said it, but... No, no, don't ruin the night, okay? Let's just have fun, okay? Yeah? Come on. Put your hands up and behind your head. I repeat, hands up behind your head. And what happened between the party and the moment you woke up in front of the body? I don't remember. That's what you said during the trial, but in these last seven years you haven't remembered anything? Not a single detail or moment? Anything could be important. It's strange that you can't remember anything. We have a lot work ahead of us before going in front of a judge. So, if you remember anything, whatever it is, let me know, okay? Okay. We have thousands of cases piling up, and she wants to reopen a seven year old case with a solid verdict. I believe, Your Honor, that Duarte and Associates' desire to gain publicity is the reason we are here; not justice. Miss? I share and understand the Attorney General's issues regarding the heavy workload, but knowing a man went to prison without a fair trial, and looking the other way because we have "too much work" is a bad image for all of us, Your Honor. She's twisting my words. That's not what I said. Forgive my misunderstanding. Please, continue. Your Honor, it's been proven that the chain of custody for the evidence wasn't handled properly, the forensic report is incomplete and the burnt, headless body wasn't analyzed. Lacking proper evidence, the district attorney focused on discrediting my client based on his profession. Why weren't other leads investigated, like the victim's wife? - Perhaps because her last name is Medina? - Objection, Your Honor! Finish up. I request that the case be reopened and parole for my client. MALAGA PENITENTIARY Hugo, we did it. Let's go. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. It's fine. I'm not used to being touched anymore. Yeah... Thank you. Without you, I would've been locked up for seven more years. You're welcome. It was very easy, I've never seen such a shit job before. The coroner's incompetence... My God, even the trial. It wasn't incompetence, it was on purpose. Someone made him do it. That's a serious accusation to make without evidence. Hello? No, no, I'm just leaving. Okay. Bye. Do you know what you're going to do? It would look good if you had a job at trial. Perhaps something discreet... I'm going back to Marbella to get my life back. Hugo, may I remind you that you are on parole. Sometimes first impressions are as important as facts. Going back to prostitution is not a good idea. I was never a prostitute. Okay, fine, stripper. Whatever. No, it's not "whatever." Okay, sorry. Okay, Hugo, listen to me. Just because they let you out doesn't mean it's over. We've proven that the trial wasn't fair, sure, but not your innocence. That starts now under a new process. So you need to understand that, given the evidence against you, it's likely that you'll be found guilty again. Your only chance is to behave yourself and stay away from Marbella and Macarena Medina. Got that? Do you need a ride? No. I'd rather go alone, thanks. - What is it, Borja? - Macarena, the verdict is out. They're repeating the trial and Hugo is out of prison. We don't understand how... It's an honor to bestow this award to the Medina family and their company. I'll leave you with the CEO, Macarena Medina. Thank you so much. Thank you. I thought that I wouldn't be able to be here to receive this award, but... luckily I was able to compose myself in the car, and calmly, I contemplated our city through the car window. There she was, Marbella, brilliant, splendid. A jewel, bathed by the sea. And I had a revelation. I felt that I, Macarena Medina, would be nothing without you. I wouldn't be anything without this city. Everything my siblings and I have achieved with MedinaCon, is solely thanks to you. Which is why this award belongs to you. I truly thank you. Thank you, thank you. You are all wonderful. Thank you so much. I'll leave you now with my brother Mateo, project and operations manager. Good afternoon. Well, the boss has spoken, so there's little else to say. Thank you. We thank you on behalf of MedinaCon. Thank you for your trust. And also, thank you on behalf of our brother Borja, who, as you know, has decided to go into politics, and even so we still think of him as family. Anyways, enjoy this excellent afternoon and thank you for coming. No, I can't pay our suppliers. Dude, I owe 13,000 bucks. No, but listen... Okay, okay. One thousand is okay. Listen, I'll see you later. Holy shit... I can't believe you're out. Why didn't you call me? I would've picked you up. Don't worry about it. Damn, you look well. Hey, do you want a beer? - Sure. - Yeah? Damn, you're finally out! I'm on parole until the next trial starts. So... what are you going to do now? I came to ask you for a job. Anything you have. But, you're going to stay in Marbella? It's my home. Where else am I going to go? I don't know, man. Anywhere else. Do you know how easy it is for someone to get you in trouble and locked up again? You're on parole. I don't know, go somewhere where they don't know you and wait for the trial there. You don't know what it's like to be in prison for seven years. Iván, I was set up, they used me like a toy, but they're going to pay for every day I was locked up. Man, it was Macarena, we all know it. She killed her husband and framed you for it. All this time I kept asking myself... why me? Why did this happen to me? Until I realized it wasn't a question of why... but of who and how. I need to know who screwed me over... and I need your help. Waiting tables. But I can't pay you much. It's fine. Hey, does my boat still float? Is it that hard to understand that we don't want to mix my status as congressman with company activity? Everyone here knows you're a congressman. I just wanted to lighten the speech. Don't listen to your brother. It's no secret. Exactly. Borja, I have to go. I have to pick up the kids. Congratulations. Thank you, Patricia. I'll see you later. Any news? Mayor. Macarena. I'm so sorry for what you're going through. Who would've thought he'd be released? It's a shame he's free, don't you think? Who's behind it? Why is that firm helping my husband's murderer? We don't know. In any case, you should rest easy. He's on parole. That doesn't make him innocent. He'll go back to prison. The company is going through a delicate time, Borja. We're about to be granted the construction of the new port. And this could ruin our chances. That guy... That guy is trash, a lowlife, a nobody, he doesn't have anything... Balls. He's got balls. That's precisely why he's here, because he's got balls. He has a new chance, and he's going all in. I'm sorry to say this, Mrs. Medina, but... chances are that this will cause some backlash. He already killed your husband; now he's after you. Are you going to do anything? About his balls, I mean... If I were God, I'd cut them off and bring them to you on a silver platter. But I'm just a cop. You should've sold it, dude. Or at least rented it out, you could've made so much money. I'm going to live here again. You're going to live here? You're crazy, man. I'm going to restore it. Oh, yeah? With what money? Your pay's going to be shit. I've never seen such a shit job before. The coroner's incompetence... It wasn't incompetence, it was on purpose. - Someone made him do it. - My God, even the trial. That's a serious accusation to make without evidence. Philip Norman's murderer sentenced to 15 years. The stripper was arrested on his boat with a burnt, headless body. Macarena Medina, with her husband's alleged murderer. It's possible that the victim found out about his wife's affair... Macarena Media, "I hope that monster rots in prison." The coroner's incompetence... The stripper killer case takes a new turn. Hugo Beltrán, is once again free due to erroneous evidence and negligence during the trial. The case of the alleged stripper killer is back in the spotlight... He might have been convicted using unreliable evidence and conclusions. CORONER'S OFFICE CARLOS BARBÉS ASSOCIATION Hugo. - Hugo. - In here. I thought you were moving the fridges. In a minute. What are you doing? Look. That was the coroner assigned to my case. He submitted an incomplete report that was used to convict me. I have to speak with him. You should let your lawyer take care of this, she knows what she's doing. Iván, my lawyer's busy, this is a low profile case for her. Can I borrow your car? I have to go to Málaga. Dude, you're going after a coroner? Don't be stupid. You're back. How are you? What's up with the beard? What's this? - Hello? - Damn... Why wouldn't I pay you? Of course I am. Yeah. I'll see you there at three. At three, yes. Why is he there? Do you know him? Fuck, Jairo. Do you mean he's...? I thought you quit doing that shit. You're worth more than that. It's good money. Right... Money. It's always money. PROFESSOR AND DOCTOR PEDRO HURTADO SPEAKS AT A CONFERENCE Doctor, doctor. Your nephew Jairo is here. Go right ahead. What a surprise, Jairo. How daring! Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm Hugo Beltrán. I spent seven years in prison because of a false report you made. I'm going to call security. Don't move. - What are you going to do? - I want to ask you some questions. I'm not talking to you. I have the texts that you send your nephew Jairo. You're very imaginative. And there are so many pictures. There's nothing wrong with that. He's of age, and I pay for his services. It's not illegal. Then how about I upload them to your wife and kids' social media pages? What happened to Philip Norman's body? You conducted the autopsy. There's not much to work with if it doesn't have a head and it's burnt. We couldn't run DNA tests. We identified the body based on a jacket that was left on the deck with his initials. And his wallet. And his blood, which covered your body and clothes. - But the report is incomplete. - Yes. The body had a titanium prosthesis from a past surgery. And why wasn't that on the report? They made me redact it, to shorten the report. Who? Doctor, excuse me. The students are here. The room is ready. I'll keep in touch. Did you get the kid's meal? Hey, my brother! What kid's meal? This has five vitamins. Maca powder and taurine. It's dynamite. - Do you want one? - No, I'm good, thanks. Listen, you're doing well, right? You just lay around all day. Well, let's just say it's part of my job. And what job is that? I'll see you in a moment, Ángela. I turn Autumn into Spring, my brother! This is a happiness machine. Right, 'cause judging by your girlfriend's age it sounds more like a time machine. Someone's gotta do it. - Or can't I use it to make some money? - Brother, you're absolutely right. Besides, I came here to offer you a job. Me? What job? At Inferno. I'm bringing back the stripper show. And I thought that perhaps your machine and you could get back on stage. Absolutely, my brother, of course. Who else have you hired? Who else? All four of us. - Hello, Macarena. How are you? - Hello, Ángel. Thank you for coming all the way here. Through here, please. My mother in law doesn't like the noise in Marbella. She prefers the countryside. A country woman who publicly trades. She isn't doing so bad. Well, we're not doing so bad. I've also put my grain of sand in the family business. There she is now. Benigna! You don't know how happy I am to see you. - And how much I cared for your father. - I know, of course I know. I see you're still taking care of your vegetable garden. I need it, and it needs me. Come, I'll show it to you. MedinaCon wants to propose a business opportunity. Well, we can always dabble in some business. You know that our company is the runner up for the construction of the new port. It's the most important construction in the last 20 years. Don't be modest, Macarena. Everyone knows you're going to get the deal. They want us to participate. Partners, 50-50. It's a big project. We can do it ourselves, but... we'd like to partner up with someone trustworthy. - You want us to put down money. - No. We want you to make money. What do the numbers say, Ángel? The numbers are good, but there is one thing... Don't take this the wrong way, but it's about the trial that's taking place again. It's best to talk about these things first. Of course. Let's talk. Very well. Could it affect the decision? You know, the news about the case, the scandal... Politicians don't like those things... And neither do banks. I understand that it may sound scandalous, but that man murdered my husband and he'll be back in prison in a few months. I'm the victim in this case, not the accused. In any case, if you have doubts about our honorability, we'll just leave it at that. We're going to build that port, with our without you. I'm sorry for what you're going through, Macarena. The Rojas family will never turn their back on you. We're more than happy to go into business with you. Police. ID? Welcome to Marbella, mister Beltrán. Would you come with us to the police station? Am I under arrest? Look, this is what we're going to do, just to make things clear, I ask the questions and you answer. Sounds good? You've met with doctor Fernández, the coroner. Is that true? - Yes. - Why? Is this an interrogation? Do you have anything to hide? No. I went to see him to talk about my case. I'm preparing my defense. He's preparing his defense. That's wonderful! A prostitute goes to visit a coroner, like it's an everyday thing. - What's next? - I'm not a prostitute. Forgive me, I always get confused with your kind, it's confusing. I can't tell between the ones who dance and the ones who suck dick, or the ones who dance and then suck dick, or the ones who suck dick but don't dance... Can I go now? What did the coroner say? It was a private conversation. Well, I hope you made the most of it because you won't be seeing him again. - I can meet with whoever I want. - Not with the coroner. He's dead. Dead? Yes. This very morning. Tell me the truth, Hugo. Was it you? I want to see my lawyer! Don't worry, kid. It was just an accident. His car drove off the road. He must've been thinking about dicks. Is he under arrest or not? - No. - Then what the hell is he doing here? At least tell me where he is. There. Hugo, Hugo, come on, let's go! - I can go? - Of course you can. These people are idiots. Hey, it's Pili and Mili. What's up, Iván? Wait for me, okay? Hugo, I need to talk to these guys. I'll see you later. Okay. Fellas, do you have time to get a coffee with an ex coworker? Of course, man. Hugo, what do you want? - What are you doing here? - You need to see this, it's important. What is this? - Is everything okay? - Yes, yes, yes. Wait for me in the car, okay? Okay. Hugo, don't show up like this again, you hear me? If you want to meet, make an appointment like everybody else. - Okay. - Okay? What is it? It's the complete forensic report. Look, scroll down. There. See? That part was missing. "A metal prosthetic has been detected in the lower lumbar area." Hugo, where did you get this from? The coroner gave it to me. The coroner? He just gave this to you willingly? More or less. What do you mean? Did you assault him? What? No! He was about to tell me who ordered him to falsify the report when we were interrupted... And now he's dead. What do you mean he's dead? First you threatened him and now he's dead? According to the police, it was a car accident. Oh, so you spoke to the police? Yes. Hugo, listen to me. I don't work like this. I don't think the firm would be interested in representing you. I know I'm not. Is that all you have to say? Yes. - After what I just told you? - Yes. Fine, I'll do this on my own. I don't need you. Good luck back in prison. - Fuck you. - No, fuck you! Let's go! Hugo! Hugo! Get out, quick! What is it, man? Search! Search, damn it! - What are you looking for? - Search over there! What? What are you looking for? Iván, what are you looking for? Cocaine, damn it. What are you talking about? Look over there. Come on, where is it? - How do you know? - I got a tip, at the police station. Have you found it yet? No. Here, here, here! Give me a knife, quick. Hurry up, damn it. Come on, come on! Shit, the cops! - Come on, come on! - I'm coming. Police! Get out! Come on, get out, damn it! Quickly, hands up where I can see them! - Get out! - What wrong? Out, damn it! - What is it now? - Don't do anything stupid. Go see what you can find. On your knees, on your knees! Fuck my life. We dodged a bullet back there. It's a good thing you still have friends in the police force. Huguito, my brother! - It's great to see you. - Rafa, two more beers. What's up? - Where's your hair? - What about yours? You're still in shape, man. This son of a bitch looks hotter than before. How are you, bro? Good. - I'm happy to be here. - We wanted to visit you. - Why wouldn't you let us? - It was better that way. Well, the past is the past. What's important is that the four of us are back together. Hey, Jairo, Has the police or anyone asked you about the coroner? How does a beer sound? Come on, a toast! To the return of the Toy Boys. Wait a minute. Whose idea was that? I'm not going back to dancing. What? But we start rehearsing tomorrow. Look, it's the perfect solution for all of us. It's good money, okay? And, Hugo, it's a great cover for your investigation. No, man, I can't. I don't want to be anybody's toy. Of course, whatever you decide, we'll stand by you. POLICE RECORD INTERROGATION Okay, tell me what happened. - I was at the party. - What else? I don't remember. I drank too much. Look... I want to help you, but you have to help me first. We have proof that you killed him. He went to your boat. We have it on tape. How did you convince him? I'm sure you didn't say, "Come to my boat, I want to cut your head off." No. I didn't do anything, I swear. I woke up and he was there! Right... It's a shame because you're so young and you're going to prison, for sure. But if you confess now, the judge will give you a lighter sentence. Son of a bitch. You have to confess and say that you are sorry. I can't remember a damn thing, but I didn't do it. And without a lawyer. Hi. Hey. So this is where you live... Yep. I got a job at Inferno. As a waiter. That's good. Can I come aboard? I requested that the body be exhumed. Does that mean you're still my lawyer? Yes. Sit down if you want. Don't you have any family here? No. Well, my mother, but... I haven't heard from her since I was 14. I don't know if she's still alive. How old were you when you met Macarena? Eighteen. And her? Thirty six or thirty seven, I think. Wow. It's not what you think. I was crazy about her and I thought she cared for me. I wasn't very smart back then. Is your boyfriend a lawyer too? No. He's an engineer, and he's not my boyfriend. Well, I don't know what we really are. I don't have time for that. I was just hired by the law firm. I'm in the big leagues now. Yesterday... Forgive me, I was an asshole. No, I'm sorry. Really, I am. Hugo, I've been looking over your case from the start and some things don't add up. I understand that you need answers, but please, you have to stop. You can't investigate on your own because you'll ruin the process. You have to let me do my job. Yeah. You're right. Thanks for the beer. You're welcome. I have to go. Grab onto this. Careful. Bye. Bye. Andrea. Andrea, can you come here for a second? Why are you fully clothed in the pool? I suppose you know that they're reopening Dad's case. Okay, there's going to be another investigation. They've exhumed his body and are analyzing it again. - Why? - I don't know, I really don't. Can I go? Ma'am. Your brother is here. Hey, Andrea. How are you? How is he? Couldn't you see? He's been like that since his father died. I just told him about the exhumation and it's like he doesn't care. Well, you know how he is. Besides, he's still a teenager... He'll grow up. Maybe I have to take him to the psychiatrist again. No. You know he doesn't want to go. Besides, it's pointless, they'll just give him more pills. Give him time. Why are you here? The case's coroner, he died in a car accident. So he won't be able to testify. Right. - Hey, look. - Hi! - Your sister. - Just what I needed... What's up? Why are you here? What's up? - Hi. - Hey, you've met Óscar, right? You know they're hiring lots of people in Australia, right? Look, Iván, he's a great dancer. I swear to God. Check out these hard-rock abs. My honeypie is going to drive the old ladies crazy. Isn't that right? What are you saying? Go talk a walk and forget about it. Hey, let me prove it to you, okay? - Come on, Iván. Please? - If you don't like it, that's fine. He's barely half a Toy Boy. - Isn't he great? - Maybe. Look, look. Bravo! Bravo! Not bad for a high school party. But... I'm going to take a chance on you. Really? Okay, okay. Don't get your hopes up. - How was it? - Amazing, really. Follow me. Wait here, please. Thank you. Hi. Take a seat, please. Did something happen? Hugo. It's important that you tell me everything you know about this case. I need to know everything; all that's happening. I don't understand. The results of the exhumation. The body does indeed have a titanium prosthesis on the spine. From a surgery that was performed about eight months before his death. Right, but... Is there any information about the killer? No. There's nothing new about the killer, but there is about the victim. And that's the problem. What problem? Hugo, you were right. I've looked into Philip's medical history and he never underwent surgery. What? He won the paddle tennis championship three years in a row. That would be impossible after a procedure like that, don't you think? What are you saying? Hugo, the dead body is not Philip. Hugo, listen to me, they have to track down the prosthetic, okay? It would be easier if he underwent surgery in Spain, but it'll hard to obtain information if it's from abroad... Mrs. Medina, your brother is here. I left the report on your desk. May I leave now? Yes, Laura, you can go. Thank you. I've been calling you. I was worried. How are you? Like I just woke up inside a nightmare. After seven years it turns out that the body wasn't my husband's. Can you explain what that means? It will all be cleared out. Macarena, why are you here? Why don't you go home? They're delaying the decision date for the port project. The longer it takes, the worse it is for us. Especially if the trial process complicates further. We could lose everything, Borja, the port construction, - the commissions we paid... - Hey. Well, I guess it's okay. I got the hardest part, support from that yokel. They have the only thing we care about: money. Yeah, but... we have a problem. If the body's not Philip's, then Philip is still alive until proven otherwise. So that means he's still a partner at MedinaCon. And we can't make such an important decision without his signature. So we can't take on new projects, Borja? Nor partner up with the Rojas, or sell the company, or buy or sell company shares. Our lawyers say that it could take anywhere between five to ten years until a missing person is officially declared dead. And the company can't wait that long. Of course not. Come on. Go rest now. We can't do anything else today. Damn it. We're fucking this up. - Can you get your shit together? - Hey, man, we were following your lead. Following my lead? He was the only one following me. Don't bullshit me, man. Come on, damn it. We start tomorrow, let's get our heads in the game, please. - We're not open to the public. - I'm looking for Hugo. It wasn't him. No, it wasn't. - Wanna go outside? - Please. What is he doing? What the fuck is he doing now? Is he crazy? Fuck this. Screw rehearsal! Let's go home! If the body wasn't Philip, the who was it? Who was with you on the boat? I don't know. I don't remember anything from that night. What if Philip staged the whole thing and he's alive? I don't know how to answer that. I have no idea of what's going on. I was 21 when I was locked up. I was 21 and locked in with animals because of you. Because of me? - Did you set me up? - You're crazy. - Tell me! - No! What kind of person do you think I am? Everything was over and done, and now all this shit is resurfacing. I hated you all those years in prison. And I missed you every day. You must think I'm so naive, right? We both know what we had between us and, believe me, that ended a long time ago. Hey. - Get out of here, man, go away. - Listen to me. I don't know what you're thinking, but I don't care. - Can you at least let me explain? - Seriously, go away! If you want to risk your life, go ahead, but you're on your own. - Fine, man. I get it. But let me... - No, I don't want you to "get it," I want you to disappear. Hugo, I've tried to help you. - I need you to know that there's a reason. - I know there's a reason. It's the same fucking reason that screwed you're life over seven years ago. So, you didn't want to be a stripper, right? Because you don't want them to use your body, only your mind, blah, blah, blah... and all that bullshit. And that bitch walks through the door and you lose your mind over her. I don't love Macarena, man. The body they found on my boat wasn't Philip. I have to get close to her to find out what happened that night. That's the reason. Triana! What, Hugo? What? This isn't what we talked about. You lied to me. You said you were working as a waiter. But you're a stripper. Why? It's all I know how to do. Mrs. Rojas, I'm so glad to see you. Carmen, look what I brought. So you know what a real tomato tastes like. Thank you so much. These are wonderful. Dolores, put these away. Very well. - So, what is it you needed to tell me? - This way, please. I knew the lawyer assigned to the case was very good, but I wasn't expecting her to find something this huge so soon. This is going to complicate things for the Medinas. A lot. Perfect. That's exactly what we were hoping for. DUARTE AND ASSOCIATES We're going to move forward, like nothing ever happened. This is a huge deal, like the one's before 2007. Medina Rojas is too long. Maybe just Rojas. My only chance to not go back to prison is to find Philip, and get the truth out of him. Maybe you kept in touch with him these past seven years. I don't know anything! - Find the coroner's car. - It's not your job to investigate. Remember, you're on parole. I want... I want a toy boy... You're crazy. And when you're not dancing in a thong, you're harassing witnesses who die after your little visits. Who do you work for? For you. I work for you. Don't tell anyone when you find my husband. What the fuck are you doing?
