He's great, right? You did it. No, we did it. We did it. Yay! Yay! Well, I'm gonna go take him down to pound town. Ah! No! Baby steps.

Sorry, james, chloe has changed. She finally likes an appropriate guy. Mark, the guy with the big hair from June's work. No way. I don't buy it. If she likes him, there's gotta be something wrong with him. We just don't know what it is yet. She only likes inappropriate guys. Not anymore.

Mark, chloe can come. Yeah, I'll come, too. I look forward to meeting your gay lover whose name is... All right. Uh, back up to six! couldn't keep brunch down for long. Brunch! chloe. chloe, this is perfect. You can tell mark you like him at a daytime chaperoned meal. Oh, god. This is such hard work. When does the fun start? When you get a ring on your finger, miss thing. What? I swung too far. Welcome, brunchers. Come on in. Okay, we got kyle at the juice station, That's tim watching football on mute While he's listening to jazz. The audio doesn't even match the visual and it's okay. It's brunch! Hey. We're not late, are we? "we"? Yeah, I just went And picked up anthony from karate class. Oh, okay. It's, uh, supposed to be brunch for just six, But sure. Whatever. You're famous. Chloe, you remember anthony, right? Look at him all sweaty in his karate gi. Smooth and hairless. Ah! You know, I finished every wii game I've ever started. Yellow belt, huh? Weak. So I realized the old woman I'd been partying with all night Was really paul mccartney. so did you tell him The green beans had been in your purse? Of course not. My skirt was already ripped. You know, anthony likes the beatles. He can sing "norwegian wood." How come everyone else has real silverware? 'cause I had place settings... For six... Anthony. time to let him know that you're interested. Tell him you want to see his apartment And get some one-on-one time. Okay. So, mark, this is a really nice room. Are there any other nice rooms that I could see? Yeah, sure. Um, the eggs are in the warming tray, The grapefruit's been sugared. Let's do it. I don't believe it. Hot 17-year-old dude in a gi. Nothing. Well, congratulations, June. I've lost her. Hmm. Can I have another juice? No. You've had three already. So this is me in high school, And that is actually this shirt. Are those crackers? Yeah, I keep them there in case I get queasy. It was June's idea. She's really smart. See, I have these weird dreams where I'm on a roller coaster... I like June. I really like June. I don't know it yet, but I like June. We're friends and June probably doesn't like me, So that's what's keeping me from seeing it. But yeah, June. That's why I was attracted to you. What? You're emotionally unavailable. You are an inappropriate guy. But just because I have a deep urge to sleep with you doesn't mean I have to. Nope. I'm walking away. I guess I have changed. sometimes you throw brunch, And sometimes brunch throws you. Oh, james. Stop pouting. You're just upset because you lost your wingman, But this is gonna be better for chloe. Better for chloe or for you? You just don't want your neighbors To think you're a slut. Why do you care so much anyway? Do you even like them? No. But you like chloe? Yeah. Yeah, 'cause she's spontaneous and charming. And fun and unpredictable. So why are you trying to change her? I should've bought more croissants. I mean, I stood there at the grocery store, I had them in my hand, and I choked. I choked. Wait. If mark is here, then who-- Anthony, no! Who are you, my ma? Oh, thank god. Wait. Then who's in there? 'sup, chickens? Arigato. Hey! Yes! Sex with a stranger in another dude's bedroom! Welcome back! I missed you so much. I couldn't do it. I couldn't marry a farmer. Where are my eggs? What's go--who was that? Um, tim? This brunch made me realize That I still like inappropriate guys. So it's not gonna work out with mark. I hope it's okay. It is okay. I am so sorry for trying to change you And make you into something that you're not. Oh, my god. I love you, too. Can't wait to see you. Love you 1,000%. Guess what. Jennifer and I are back together! That's great. Just don't let her change you. I won't. Okay, everybody out. I need to shave and put on some sleeves. Uh, we're gonna see if we can squeeze in a hike. Cats can't walk themselves. So let's go, bruce lee. Come on. Let's go. Well, I guess it's for the best That it didn't work out with you and mark. It just wasn't meant to be. Yeah, and I got the sense That he had a thing for somebody else. Okay. Let's go. I need you to come to a party with me right now. I was supposed to go with luther, but he's killing me. I know you think you're pretty, But you're sean astin pretty, not van der beek pretty. + All right. Sorry, luther. My wingman is back. I'm tapping you out. But we're making progress. I found you a fixer-upper. I'm circling her problem areas. She's gonna go work on them and come back. Luther, this girl is beautiful. See what I'm talking about? Nothing pleases him. Excuse me for striving for perfection... For you. Luther, I'm--that's-- that's not... for you, james! For you! Synced By YesCool www.addic7ed.com
