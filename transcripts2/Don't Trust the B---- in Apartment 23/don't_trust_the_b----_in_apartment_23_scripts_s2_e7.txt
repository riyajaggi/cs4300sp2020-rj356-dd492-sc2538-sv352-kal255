 You've just been waiting by the phone For some dumb guy you like to call you back. I am waiting to hear back about a job interview At Harkin Financial. The C.E.O. Is in town from London, And I'm waiting to hear if he wants to meet with me. Well, whoever it is, I hope you let them touch your boob. Why are you wrapped in tinfoil? Chloe, I can't go to the Hamptons With you this weekend. My whole plan was to stare at my cell phone And reread old report cards to calm my nerves. June, that is the beauty of cell phones. You can take them with you and stare at them anywhere. James needs us. He's so depressed From his flameout on "Dancing with the Stars," Not to mention being the butt of every Jimmy Kimmel joke. So we are taking him on a weekend bender. I've never seen him like this. He stopped googling himself. Well, I guess I could go. I'll have my cell phone with me the whole time, And if I need to come back, it's only a 2-hour drive. Give or take. Depending on whether or not Billy Joel's ass is on the road. I've always wanted to go to a real life Hamptons lighthouse, In rainy weather, In a fisherman's sweater, On a bike, With a sandwich and my thoughts. I almost just hit you. I almost just lost control and hit you. Okay, so it's settled. We'll get drunk on the drive up, And then we'll stay at our crazy friend Katarina's house And then we'll hit the Willoughby party. The what? The Willoughby party. It's the best party of the year. It's hosted by this mysterious guy named Willoughby. I've never actually met him, but his parties are beyond. ♪ never, never, never ♪ ♪ am sorry for partying ♪ ♪ I want to party but I won't say that ♪ ♪ baby, I'm never, I'm never, I'm never ♪ Whoo!

Yeah, you know, this year, I was thinking, I really want to do something special, You know, something that matters. James is about to come down. Don't treat him any differently, but don't look directly at him. Compliment his outfit, but not too much, or he'll know. They hate my hat. That hat was given to you by Mr. Jason Mraz.

Hi, aunt Nancy. You know, you really should stop calling from a blocked number. Do we go in or do we just wait out here? What's the étiquette? I love rocking chairs. I have two in my apartment... One in the living room And one in the bathroom. You wouldn't think it would get much use in there, But it does. Mm. It smells like poo in this house. Well, why don't we just yell "cut" And have them take the babies away? Cut. Katarina, would you mind if I borrowed your bicycle? I'd love to go bird-watching. Help yourself... To the bike and anything else I used to enjoy. Yeah! Bender! no! Okay. So you're going to need this map, Binoculars, a whistle, Sunscreen, a mosquito netting... I don't need mosquito netting.

Or I'm just wearing pajamas and a sweater that I borrowed. Presto. Instant success. Willoughby, currently of East Hampton. Wait. You're willoughby the party guy? You're judging me, and it stings, So keep doing it. This is a riddle invitation for my party tonight. What do you think of the font? You would've picked a different one. How do you do it? I guess we're all just one small hole in the condom away From having our lives totally destroyed. Chloe, I got some pretty serious soul searching to do. I think I'm gonna have to take this bender solo. You gotta follow the bender. I understand. If you need me, I'll be trudging down a quiet hamptons road... Alone. Wake up, bitch. I just worry about your arches in those shoes. perfect. So I just met Willoughby. What? Oh, my god! A Willoughby riddle. "on this day occurred a love massacre, "when the clock struck a manic gay actor Who does not like to work subtle." It's his new address or something. the Valentine's day massacre was February 14th. Everyone knows that. I'm instantly picturing a grandfather clock. Oh! Who is that actor who I thought was claymation? Oh! Oh! Oh! Nathan Lane! Oh. That's it! 214 grandfather Lane. That's it. That's the address of the party. We're so going. Oh, I'm sorry. I can't. I have to get up super early. I'm going to get, uh, scones at Maude's. They run out of the blue... My list! June, you have to go where the bender takes you, And I am telling you, your bender is Taking you to willoughby's party, Where you will introduce me to Willoughby, And I will meet him and I will bang him.

You might as well have just stayed home And stared at your phone on the coffee table. no one's called since aunt Nancy. Exactly. So relax. Come on. There is a fabulous party with our names on it. I'm sure you could borrow something to wear of Katarina's. I know. Something with a crotch. Chloe asked me to look after James. She deputized me... With her eyes, not with her words. Yeah! Pass me! Look at you go! You're an asian-american driving poorly, And I'm an african-american sitting in the back of the bus, Both chasing A distant white man. This is not why my mother marched on Washington. Oh, sweet freedom, where is James? Coffee guy? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Well, I heard a-a high-pitched squeak. I thought a little girl was in trouble. It was my girlfriend Jennifer. She broke up with me again, this time for good. She thought I was gonna propose to her this weekend, So she kept looking for an engagement ring In everything I handed her. She tore apart a pinecone with her bare hands. James! James! I see you're on a bender. I, too, am trying to drink my pain away. I thought I wanted to do the lonely bender, But the quiet just makes it worse. James! My lonely road has brought me to you. I think we're supposed to be bender buddies. I have cookies! Excuse me. Pollen. ♪ oh ♪ God, put that pie away. What is the matter with you? It's my host gift.

Oh, I just had one of those moments Where I realize what a great girl I am. Wow! This house is amazing! And I love this dress of Katarina's. It's tight, but I get it. It even has a cool phone pocket. Oh, my god! Katarina's pill pocket! A lot of good times in that pocket. A lot of memories. Oh, no. Oh, no. There's no bars. There's no signal.

It got taken away from me. Who cares, man? Make your own opportunity, James. You want to dance, then dance. We just gotta find you a floor. Ow! Dude! Chloe just texted me Willoughby's address. Willoughby has a floor. Yeah! Yeah! Whoa! So close. So close. I went up on the roof with Willoughby And got a signal. No messages. Also, he said that your marriage wasn't legal. The priest was some club kid named Stinklord Who had a tattoo of a cross on his neck. Is everything okay?

So you're okay with all of this? Well, when I was having sex with Lenny, I was thinking, I've had sex with him for five years in a row, And it's still great.
