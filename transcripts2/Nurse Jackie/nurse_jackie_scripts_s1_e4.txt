 Previously on Nurse Jackie: Could the bubonic plague ever happen again? No, sweetie. What about the flu? I'm wondering if it's bigger than that. No, I don't think it is. I think she's gonna be a teenager. I think... Her moods are erratic. You know what, I think it's normal. I think Grace is starting to unravel a little bit. Scaring the shit out of me. If you need anything and I mean anything, you better tell me, or I will kill you.

 How are we on time? No, we're good. Just don't get fancy. I have seen hundreds of you jerkoffs blow through these doors, test scores through the roof, but a total fucking retard when it comes to actual patients. I know you. You spend enough time in one place and you know the answers to questions that you never even asked. Why are Manny's scrubs wrinkled? He's dressing out of a hamper, cycling off his antidepressants. It's not like I wanna know this stuff. I just do.

 And it's not always bad. This will be O'Hara. And that coffee is for me. Oh, shit. That's a kid. Throw him in the slot. Respiratory stat. Seven-year-old boy, Julien Armando. Mother witnessed fall from playground. Boarded and collared at the scene. Immediately unconscious. BP is 140/80. Shallow breaths, diminished breath sounds. Shallow respirations at 14, possible hemothorax. On my count. One, two, three. - Any allergies? - Mother says none. Central Park gets those rubbery ground covers. Alphabets get monkey bars and concrete. On the bright side, I am here, so he's a lucky boy. Get the mother out, tell her we'll talk to her in a minute. But I want to see the... Zoey, go. Please wait behind the yellow line. When the physician has more information, she'll let you know. COOPER: ♪ I've got a gunshot ♪ ♪ I've got a gunshot ♪ Hey. Um... He's just happy. Happy? Wait. No. Um... He's interest... He's excited... He's interested to experience the, um... the challenge of a bullet wound. Um... There's waffles in the cafeteria today. We need a chest tube set up. Yeah, got it. Lovely. Chest wall movement isn't symmetrical. Okay, we want a nice big line, Jacks. Breath signs noted on the left side only. Oxygen sat 93 percent. Can I take the collar off? Mm-hm. Oh, lovely, Jacks. A big old fatty. Been around the block a few times. Thank God for that. Right. Splash and slash. Hmm. I've been around the block too, you know. In a nicer car, of course. Hang in there, little man. Dr. O'Hara is the best possible doctor, so he's in the best possible... Oh, hello. Um, Mrs... Armando, Julien's mom. Hi, sweetie. What's your name? Justin Armando. You're older than your brother? By eight minutes. Yeah, you look older. He does. You do. I am Dr. O'Hara. Listen, the impact from your son's fall has caused his lung to collapse. No, no. It's okay, though. We sedated him. We got the fluid out of his lung. He's doing great. He is stabilized for now. He's on his way up to CAT scan so we can get a better idea of what we're up against. Brain damage, spinal-cord injury, internal bleeding, that sort of thing. Not that bad. You can go up and see him soon. And just so you know, Mrs. Armando, O'Hara is the very best. I would trust her with my own life. If you need anything, sweetie, Zoey can help you. Okay? I'll be back in a little bit. Give them a hug. A hug. I thought it was no big deal. Kevin, if I'd known, I could've taken the shift off. Sorry, babe, but it's not just a progress report for Grace. It's some kind of conference. Holy crap. What's it about? I don't know. There's a time. It looks important. We should both go. All right. I'm coming. Love you. All right, love you. Bye. Hey, you. Oh, God. Eddie, you scared me. Where are you off to? I have a tooth thing. My dentist is gonna fit me in. Oh, let me give you a ride. No, that's all right. I'm good. I got an extra helmet, seriously. No. Uh, it's a nice walk, actually. Are you in pain? Dentist's only gonna give you ibuprofen. I got the good stuff. No, I'm gonna tough it out. All right. See you, tough guy. Think it's true what they say about twins, that they can read each other's minds, feel each other's pain? Definitely. I'm a twin. I was a twin. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Chica, never do that. Never think you should feel sorry for me. I get the "aw" thing, and I immediately wanna eat three sleeves of Oreos. He died when we were a year old. See, now I want to say I'm sorry again. Do you remember him? You know, I do. I remember being with someone, you know. Like I came into the world with someone. I didn't come here alone, so, you know, being "alone" alone is hard for me. It doesn't feel bad. It just feels wrong. Ever think about what he would be like? Every day. Have you ever used hot rollers? Why? Should I? Hmm. Ahh... Hmm. No, that's worse. Hey, babe. Hey. Did you figure out that noise from the fridge? Yeah. I cleaned the condenser. Thank God. The same one new was like 2 grand. If it breaks again, we can move into the bar, eat jerky. You are not still buying that jerky. What? I feel bad for the rep. He used to be a fireman. Kevin, you are such a softy. I got a great comeback to that. We are in a school, please. Wait. I bought you socks on the street. Gold Toes, my favorites. Something wrong? No, I just lost a patient. Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Peyton. We're ready for you. Okay. Excuse me. Ladies first. Grace is a lovely girl. Thank you. She's our favorite. I'm kidding. Her grades are good, but we're a little concerned about some of her creative work. I've asked Connie, our school nurse, and district psychologist Skip Nannerine to weigh in. Hey, Skip. How are you? I have bursitis. I believe your daughter Grace is experiencing signs of generalized anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorder? Hey, hi, sweetie. Uh, please, continue. Mom and Dad are here. What? Where? In your classroom talking to your teacher. You're in trouble. Oh. Well, I'm quite happy to say that your son is stable and doing very well. Test results show no spinal damage nor internal injuries beyond the lung. Thank you so much, doctor. Thank you. You can go and see him now. Wait right here, okay? Uh-huh. Whoa. Um... Where is Jackie? Jacks? Someone? Anyone? Christ. Okay, let's keep moving, mate. Come on. You're a heavy little bugger, aren't you? Okay, so? I don't know. Looks pretty good to me. She's always drawing my hair longer. She hates this haircut. The brickwork is pretty phenomenal. That's my bar. That I own, not where I drink. I mean, the sign and everything. I mean, it's pretty nice work. Right. Right, but please, try to focus on what's lacking in the scene. Her pictures are consistently devoid of color. Uh... Yeah. She never draws a sun in any of her skies. Sometimes that can be a sign. Sign of what? Children tend to draw optimistically. Trees are huge, skies are blue. It's how they see the world. Yeah. Are there any problems at home? Problems? No. None. She circles her desk three times before she sits down. She told me it's so the planes don't fall out of the sky. Okay. You know what? I... How do you think we should address this problem? I mean, if it is a problem. I'll be happy to furnish you with a list of psychiatrists. Sliding scale per income/insurance. They'll be able to diagnose Grace. And put her on what I think is necessary. An age-appropriate, low-dose, anti-anxiety medicine. Okay, that's enough out of you. Uh, thank you, everybody. Um, you know what? This is a lot to take in all at once. And, um, we'll have to... We'll figure this out. Thanks for your time. It's amazing to me. Think a kid has a problem, make him take a pill. That's nice work. Fiona told me you guys were here. Hi, sweetie. Mrs. Vogal says that you have good grades. We're proud of you, monkey. Ah. Duty calls. I'll be right back, okay? Hey. Hey, Connie. Connie, hey. I'm sorry I got a little bit rattled in there. It's hard to listen to a bunch of strangers criticizing my kid. Nobody was criticizing. We're here to help. No. Yes, I know, I know. Look, we are both nurses, and I really wanna understand this. You don't think they're going a little overboard? There's no sun in the pictures? Please. Okay, so she circles the desk. I don't know, maybe it could be... It's a big deal. Look, you know how quickly kids change developmentally. Just when you think you know them, suddenly they're into something else. In six months, she could be a completely different kid. In which case, this meeting becomes totally irrelevant. Your daughter has serious issues. Issues? What issues? She has a personality. You guys, the minute they show even the slightest sign of being a little bit different you wanna write them a prescription. Ohh, you feel a little warm, sweetie. Yeah, you better get him started on Prozac. Have a nice day, Mrs. Peyton. I left a hemorrhaging ulcer to listen to your bullshit. I can say that. You cannot. Such a bunch of fucking idiots. That Nannerine guy, what the hell was that? I guarantee he's a hoarder. Nannerine is not the problem. We have a problem? Do you think Grace should be on drugs? They gave us their opinions, but we're gonna decide what's best for her. What's to decide? I'm not thrilled that she thinks planes are gonna fall if she doesn't do that thing around her desk. She watches too much news. You cannot let her sit all day and watch a TV. Well, who was snoring while our daughter was watching World's Scariest Shit On Fire? If you saw, why didn't you do something? You also forgot to turn the crock pot on. I had to deal with a very stinky piece of pot roast this morning. I'm thinking maybe private school. Well, that might be extreme. And expensive. So we'll tighten our belts. For some reason, that made me hungry. Can you make us tacos tonight? Okay, baby. All right, I gotta get back. I'll see you later. See you. Eddie here. Hey, it's me. Hey. Hey. Hey. Save it. I switched services, got a new number. All right. By the way, "Me so horny" makes me not so much. Hmm. All right. Uhh... For the pain. Oh. Thank you. Mm-hm. See you. Lucille Marinovich. Comes a couple times a month from a skilled nursing facility. End-stage COPD, hypoxic. The patient's been on long-term steroids. Sputum's light yellow. - Okay. Where's Dr. Cooper? He had a gunshot. Ah. Was it exciting? I don't know. I wasn't there. No, you didn't miss anything. Tuesday's was a lot harder. I have been consistently shut out of all of the interesting cases today and I'm not at all pleased. Wow, you are scary when you're mad. All right. This one's all yours. She has a health proxy, DNR. Keep the BiPAP going. Watch the pulse ox. And she's gonna hate the mask. Keep it on her. I'm gonna have to put this on now. Hey, Lucille. You feeling crummy? Ohh. Don't look at me, Dr. Cooper. I didn't get a chance to put my eyebrows on. You're beautiful. Why don't you put that mask on so you can get better and go back to Highland Gardens. We had orange roughy for dinner last night. Mmm. Yeah. It's a mild fish. It sure is. Oh. There you go. Now you know I wear a wig. But I didn't know till just this minute. Hmm? Hmm? Huh? Hey, I'll be back. Don't go anywhere. No. Put your mask on. All right. Can you sit up a little bit for me? Thank you. And I'm gonna ask you to put this mask to your face. You good? I'm good. Shit, Jacks, you go missing in action and I'm left dealing with some sticky little tot. I needed your hugs and warm nursey eyes to deflect his hero worship. You had to be nice? I can't believe I missed it. His mucky little fingers ruined a pair of $80 tights. Remind me why you don't have kids. By the way, I've seen you throw more than that in the trash. I'd have preferred them to have been ripped off in the heat of something, as opposed to being destroyed by sullied midget digits. I would see that band. Oh, I bought us two napoleons from Le Cirque. They're in the insulin fridge. I want mine right now. Seriously, right now. Dr. O'Hara. Excuse me. Justin has something for you. Really? Eighty bucks. I made a picture of you. Wow, thank you so much, Justin. You're welcome. Now, you be a good boy and always remember to help ladies on with their coats. Perfect. Thank you. Bye. Eh. Doesn't look anything like me. Everybody has a first. It's never easy. And if it does become easy, it's time to quit. Yeah, but gunshot guy's alive. Collapsed-lung boy's alive. Mine's dead. I hear you. Go ahead. It's okay. Can't talk. Love you. I just had the most awesome gunshot today. Guy's totally stabilized. Coop, one. Death, zero. Boo-yah! Do you think we should tell Coop? No, let's let him have this one. Okay, let's clean her up. You have the gauze? Yes. You okay? Yeah. Oh. What? I wanna do her eyebrows. Right. I have a makeup pencil in my purse.
