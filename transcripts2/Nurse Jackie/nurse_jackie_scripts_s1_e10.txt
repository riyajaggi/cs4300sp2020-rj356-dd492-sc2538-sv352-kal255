 Previously on Nurse Jackie: They're replacing me with a Pyxis. A fucking Pyxis? Are you kidding me? I can meet your kid. We don't have to keep hiding all the time. I'll give you a dollar if you don't go to work today. Daddy's gonna take you home. I want the hospital to burn down. When I get nervous, I act out with sexual touches. It's like Tourette's. It's completely involuntary. I was not gossiping.

Grace, honey, this is Mrs. Flynn. She's in the parish. We just joined. She's fourth grade. Oh, fifth. Your mom and I went to high school together. Yes, we did, a million years ago. Oh, half a million. Go, Hornets. She was the homecoming queen. Yes, I know. I know. I voted for her. Ha, ha. Well... It's a nice parish. You and Kevin will like it. Yeah, yeah, I think we will. Yeah. We're going to Dunkin' Donuts. A bunch of us are going. We'd love it if you came along. Oh, thank you, but I've got this thing in the city. She has to go to work. Yes. In case you thought I was going to the opera. Maybe next week. Okay. I'm sorry, sweetie. Did you wanna go out for donuts? No. No? Hey, what did Kaitlyn whisper to you back there? I mean, unless it's private, which is fine if it's private. She said that her mom was Dad's girlfriend before you. Oh, please. She wishes. Yeah. Ha, ha, ha. Sunday? Saturday. Really? Hm. It feels like Sunday. Well, I'm pretty sure. Yeah, mother-daughter tap is Saturday. You take tap with your mother? I do. And we're good. I'll bet you are. What's up with O'Hara? Who knows? Usually she says hello. No, she only says hello when she's bored. Or if she's wearing something new and she wants someone to notice. God, you're right. Those Chanel pumps are hot, though. Well, she has taste. It doesn't mean she has manners. Mm. When you have a minute... Fucking doctors. Right? Well, I can't do more than say I'm sorry and I promise you it will never happen again. I understand. Clearly, you don't know me well enough to know that I'm famous for not making the same mistake twice. So whenever you've finished doling out this punishment, or whatever it is, I'm here. Keep pouting and your face will freeze. Ring, Jacks. Oh, gosh. Whose stuff? Peace offering. Hey, Jackie. Eddie, hi. Hey. I... Brr. Right? A little... You need a sweater. That thing you wanted, the... What's it? Oh, yes, for the guy in... Yeah, for him. It will be ready in five. Okay, see you then. Notification, ETA, three minutes, cardiac arrest. Oh, come on. Uh, no. Blue team to Trauma Room, stat. Blue team to Trauma Room, stat. Okay. Unknown, 30, male. Found down at the post office. Witnesses called 911. Notification, V-fib, arrest. Down 30 minutes, nada, zip. Great. On my count. One, two, three. V-fib, continue CPR. Maintain the airway. Hold compression. Still on V-fib. Paddle up. Is that his phone? Focus, Zoey. Clear. All clear? Nothing. Give him 1 milligram of epi. Continue CPR. At the newsstand today, did you see a ring on my finger? No. Did you lose one? Yeah, I did. Hold compression. Still on V-fib. Give him a milligram of atropine. Continue compression. Hold compression. Call it. Eleven twenty-six. Do you want us to...? No, I got it. Hi. This is a message... Uh, well, I don't know who this message is for. I'm calling from Chris' phone. Chris is at All Saints Hospital. Um, if you are concerned about him or if you know anybody who's concerned about him, please have them come down to the ER here, please. This is a critical situation and, um, he needs your help, okay? Thank you. This is Jackie. God. Oh, please. Ah, fuck. Jackie. It's Melissa. Uh, Fitch's girlfriend. Oh, sure, right. Uh, how's your mom? She's the one who's having a third of her colon removed, but I'm the one who's a wreck. Yeah, well, the flowers are beautiful. She'll love them. Oh, no, she doesn't go in till next week. They're for Fitch. Hey, it's my ladies. Hey. Hi. Oh... Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha. Can I talk to you for a second? Uh, Medical Records is up my ass for the paperwork on a donor I didn't certify. Regional Transplant says you said that I signed off on it. How...? I... I wasn't even there. How did I sign off? They're trying to close the case for insurance purposes. It's all an internal thing. Don't worry. Where's the chart? Because legally... Legally, organs can be harvested without the family's consent, so just settle down. What if a loved one gets pissed, huh? What if I get accused of telling a surgeon to cut a heart out of his body without proof of brain death? That's considered murder, Jackie. You're being a little dramatic. I will turn on you so fast, it will make your head spin. Be careful. You're gonna scare your girlfriend. Uh, it was nice to see you, Melissa. Oh, bye. I'll bring it right back. Hey, coming by? Yeah, five minutes. Gloves? Uh, urine samples. Time to delegate the piss run. What can I say? It's the highlight of my day. See you. Hey. Do you ever knock? Favor? Only if you're not angry anymore. Oh, please. You're sure about this? Positive. For the record, I'm officially questioning your judgment. Duly noted. How are you gonna explain a sawn-off wedding ring to Kevin? I will think of something. Can't you say you lost it? Losing it implies that I didn't care to keep track of it. And sawing it off is better? Can you do this, please? Okay. Hold still. I am. I am. Hold still, hold still. I am. Hold still. You're not, you're jittery. Oh, c... Well, when you're right, you're right. Oh, Coop is on a tear. I, uh, cut some corners with a potential donor. Did you do anything illegal? I did. Could you be fired? At the very least. Strangely, I could live with that. Okay, then. What I cannot live with is Coop holding this over my head. I'd offer to dress him down for you, but unfortunately I suspect he'll get all grabby and wreck a perfectly good bra. Besides, you're a smart girl. You know what to do. I do. I do? If anyone knows how to drive him around the bend, it's you. Okay. Hand over. Now, hold still. Mm-hm. Speak now or forever hold your peace. Hey. Can I keep these in here? What's the matter with your office? Allergies. We can share them. Mm? Yeah. They look expensive. Grateful patient? Girlfriend. Really? A girl brought you flowers. Life of Riley, Coop, shit. I have no idea what that means. Life of Riley. Hey. You two need a minute? Ha. Coop's girlfriend brought him flowers. Yes, I saw. Got paperwork for me? Actually, Eddie, if you don't mind, I need a minute with Dr. Cooper. Yeah, technically, I'm not supposed to leave anyone in here. But I, uh... I tell you what, I'm gonna lock up and go grab a cup of soup from the caff. Appreciate it, bro. Yeah. Hey, no worries. I'll keep her away from the good stuff. Heh. You really just said that? It was a joke. Yes. No, I realize that. I was just trying to lighten the tension. There is always gonna be tension between us. You know, we're very different, you and me. I don't get you. I don't get your sense of humor. And I really don't appreciate you coming after me with this donor shit, okay? You weren't there. There was this huge gap where a doctor was supposed to be. And so I jumped in. That's what happened. It's just not a big deal. It is a big deal. I'm qualified, you're not. That's... New York law says that. Not me. Either way, that's insulting. And for you to threaten me the way you did this morning, it's just unconscionable. Do you know what that means? Heh, yeah. I have been watching people die since you were on the fucking playground. So knock it off. I'm so sorry, Jackie. I... It's okay, it's all right. Don't panic. Fuck. Listen, it's been a shitty day. Cardiac arrest. You really did everything you could back there. You were really very smart. You don't need to panic. Okay? You just need to trust me. And I need to be able to trust you. You can. You told Eddie I have a kid. No. No, I didn't. Yes, I did. I'm sorry. Which is bigger, morbidly obese or super obese? I have it written down somewhere. Get back to me on that. Mo-Mo and I just cleaned a really big man. Six hundred pounds. I don't wanna hear about it. Anybody ever call about the cardiac arrest? No. Do you think he had kids? Hope not. Bad things are 100 times worse when there's kids involved, you know? Yeah. I know. Mm. Excuse me. Where is Eddie? In there. ♪ Never even knew my name ♪ ♪ You... ♪ Hey. I took some valium. I'm throwing a little going-away party in my head. Oh. Can I come? No. Are you kidding? Up here, you're already topless and you look fucking awesome. And this fully-clothed thing is a bit of a drag, hm? Little valium, huh? Mm-hm. Rocking the benzos, baby. Mm-hm. What are they gonna do, fire me? Where is everybody? Ah. I've been waiting for that all day. It's super. Ah! Ah! Zoey. Ooh, ah! Zoey. Close the fucking door. Um! I'm so sorry, you guys. What are you doing here? Uh... Super obese is bigger than morbidly obese. What makes you think I wanna talk about that with no shirt on? You said get back to me. It's a figure of speech, Zoey. Get outta here! I know, I know. Oh, I know. Bye, Eddie. Bye. Wh... Laugh or cry? Laugh. I... For God's sake. Ugh! Cómo está, Padre Vicente? Close the roller clamp. Check the expiration date on the new bag. You and Eddie are really cute together. I am not afraid to kill you in front of a priest. No. Okay. Heh. Soup for you. Ah. Gracias. Et voilà. French. So he didn't eat any of the soup? A little. I think he's afraid God will punish him. Personally, I don't think God punishes us. What about you? No. Zoey, what you walked in on was very, very private. Oh, I know. Listen, I don't have any judgment or anything. I don't care if you do. I went to second with my manager at Burger King, so I get it. See, I d... I don't wanna know that. You walked in on me. I didn't share this information with you. I don't want you to share this information with me. Got it. We're professionals. Okay, this does not count as food. Make sure he understands that, please. You want the rest? No, thank you. Right, no sharing. Zoey walked in on me and Eddie. And I kissed Coop. Yeah, I thought you'd like that. Find your ring? No, I never did. What's it look like? It's simple. It's just a ring. I had it for a long time. That's heartbreaking. You know what? Pray to St. Anthony. I've lost so much stuff. Oh, my God. I'm pretty sure it's gone. So let me pray to St. Anthony. You're very sweet. You do whatever you wanna do. I want to find your ring because then I'll have done one good thing today. If I can do one good thing a day, I feel good about my life. That's doable. Believe me, it's harder than it sounds. Plus, I got a lot of bad shit I'm trying to make up for. I don't believe you, Mohammed. That's 'cause you're a good person. I gotta go, honey. See ya. Zoey? Can you, uh, page Dr. O'Hara for me? She left. Are you okay? Uh, page Dr. Cooper for me, please. I really appreciate this. Ah. It's what I do. Jesus, what did you do? I'm sorry about this morning. It's a lot of tension flying around. If I was mean, I apologize. I'm keeping the kiss. If you tell Eddie, I'll have to kill you. How stupid do you think I am? Don't answer that. You're not a bad guy. That's what I've been trying to tell you. Hm. I'm gonna go now. Okay. Sorry about your finger. And the other thing. It's okay. It's over with. Uh, I got Father... I don't remember his name, but I got him to eat. Really? Really. Want me to wait for you? No. You go ahead. Good night, Jackie. Good night. Hello? Yes. Yes, this is Chris' phone. Um, what's your name? I'm afraid we have some bad news. We don't know too many details, but apparently his heart stopped beating, and we tried to revive him. No. No, he wasn't in any pain. He wasn't alone, I know. So I'm so sorry.
