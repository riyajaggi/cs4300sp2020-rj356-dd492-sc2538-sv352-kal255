 I'm here to help you. Can you tell me what happened? I was raped. Okay. Can you tell me everything that happened? Everything you remember. Um... Okay, I was... I was asleep. Do you know what time this was? It was late. I didn't... I didn't go to sleep till four. So, you were up late. Were you out? No, I was here. I went to bed early, but then Connor called, and we got to talk...

 Conner, is that a friend or boyfriend? - A friend. - He used to be a boyfriend. And how long did you talk? A couple hours. - And you fell asleep. - Yeah. What then? And then he raped me. Honey, you need to be more specific. Let's go back to when he was standing by your bed. Did he say anything? He said if I screamed, he'd kill me. Police. I was asleep when she called. - What's your name? - Ann. I dunno who they're looking for. She was really upset, so I called 911. Then he... he took this thing out of his backpack and blindfolded me with it. Anything else? Yeah, um... ...a condom. Then what happened after he blindfolded you? He tied my hands. No, um... first, he tied my hands. Using what? Shoelaces. Also from the backpack? No, they were mine. And then what happened after that? And then? Did he also penetrate you anally? Was the penetration with his penis or his fingers? Not his fingers. So, when it was over, what happened then? Then he... he put something on my stomach and took a picture of it. You were still blindfolded? Mm-hm. How'd you know he was taking a picture of you? Uh... Because there were... flashes. And he said if I told anybody, that he'd post the picture. Did he say anything else? He... said that it wasn't as good as how he pictured it in his head. Can you give me a physical description of him? Um, he had on a mask, so I can't... Anything that you remember will help. Was he short, tall? Tall. Race? - White. - Eyes? I don't know, like... light, like, not... brown. He had a gray sweater. Excuse me. What's going on? Are you a resident? I work in there. Go ahead. That's Marie's. I helped her buy it. She has a set... - Uh, don't touch that. Sorry. - Excuse me, miss. It's okay, I'm her counselor. Are you okay? Come here. I'm so sorry this happened. I'm so, so, so sorry. - Hey, Judith. - Hey, Becca. What do we got? Sir, I, uh, got an initial statement from the victim. She's shaken up. Hi, Marie, I'm Detective Parker. This is Detective Pruitt. We're in charge of the investigation. Um... I know this is hard, but I need to ask you some questions about what happened. I already told him. Officer Curran. That's good. Curran's a good cop. But I'm lead detective on this, so I need to hear what happened directly from you. Okay? - Okay. - And my partners need to collect some evidence for the crime lab. Is that okay? Okay. Let's start at the beginning. Uh, last night before all this happened, what were you doing? I... I was asleep. And before that? I was on the phone. Bye. You scream, I'll kill you. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, just to be clear, the blindfold and the condom were from his backpack, but the laces and the knife were yours? Got it. How long did the assault last? I don't know. And what happened when it was over? He left. Thank you, Marie. Um... I'll need to ask you some more questions down at the station a little later. But right now, you need to go to the hospital. They'll have to examine you. You'll need a change of clothes. Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't touch that right now. All right, just tell the investigators what to get for you. Okay, you can turn around. Sorry, you're almost done. Again? I already told the cop. Two cops. I know, sorry. We need it for our records. I was asleep. No sign of forced entry. Gotta assume she left the door unlocked. Probably the sliding one. Body fluids? Collected two small stains from the sheets. Also found a couple of loose hairs on the floor. Prints? Lifted two partials off the slider. Not enough to enter in the AFIS. What'd the neighbors say? We're knocking on doors. So far, nothing. You should go. - I don't want to leave you, honey. - No, go. It sucks when no one's there to pick you up from school. Well... Okay. I'll check back in soon. It'll be a total of 12 swabs. Four from the vagina, four from the rectum, and four from the area between. I'm also going to need to use a speculum to collect your vaginal discharge. I have to ask if you've had consensual intercourse in the last 72 hours. Mm-mm. Here we go. Now, I'm going to apply a dye to your genital area. It shows the difference between healthy tissue and injured tissue. Oh, not yet. Almost done. One more thing. Your signature, here and here. Thanks. These are your antibiotics in case you've been exposed to any STDs. Four pills, you're gonna take 'em all at the same time with water. This is your morning-after pill. Just one, also with water. This is for you. Now, if you experience any of the following: excessive bleeding, vaginal discharge, shortness of breath, trouble swallowing, hives, thoughts of killing yourself... there's a number there I listed it on your instructions. Hi, Marie, how you doing? I have a headache. I'm sorry. I'll try to get you out of here as fast as I can. I just want to go over the incident once more. But I already told you everything. I know, it's tough. A lot of times, as a victim talks about a crime, new details come out. Uh, sometimes important ones. I really want to find this guy. I want to make him pay for what he did to you. And I want to make sure he never does it to anyone else. So... I need all the details I can get. So, let's start at the beginning. All right, before the assault. It was late. I was in bed. I stayed up talking to Connor. And then at, like, four, I feel asleep. You scream, I'll kill you. How would you describe his voice? I don't... Uh, just normal. No accent, no defining characteristic? No, just a voice. Okay. What next? Hang on. Did you say a hoodie or a sweater? Uh, a hoodie. You're sure? I mean, yeah. Okay. And the actual assault. Did he penetrate you vaginally, anally, both? Um, vaginally. Hang on. Five minutes? Um, around that, yeah. Okay. And after that? He left. - Right away? - No, not, like, right away. He took the blindfold off, then packed up his stuff. The blindfold and the condom, but he left the knife and the shoelaces. - Mm. - And then he left. Uh-huh. And what did you do then? So, the call to the neighbor, that came after you talked to Judith? Yeah. And you called her because...? What? I'm just wondering why you also called Amelia. Oh, she's... 'cause she's my... she's my friend. Got it. Okay. Just two more things. Um, this is a medical release. By signing it, you give us access to the information from the exam they did on you over at Snohomish. And, uh, this is a witness statement. I just need you to write out the statement you just told me. What the... So, the whole thing? Yeah, we need it in your own words. Sir, my... Sorry, I'm just really tired. And my head is just kinda killing me. Okay. Okay. Um... Sign the medical release now. Take the statement home. All right, just fill it out in the next day or two... and get it back to me. Okay. I'm so sorry. We're all here for you. It's just really important to lock your doors. You've gotta lock them. And your windows. You have to. You just have to keep yourself safe. You can stay as long as you want. Oh, Ty said I'll probably get a new apartment tomorrow. So soon? I kinda like having you as a roommate. ♪...Something before this night ends ♪ ♪ Unfortunately, in my head ♪ - Are you calling Connor? - No, my foster mom. Not the one that was here, another one, Colleen. How many did you have? Oh, like... a million. Colleen was a good one. ♪ And all the eyes on me ♪ ♪ And all the eyes on me ♪ Hi. It's me. So, how's she doing? She was raped. Last night, in her apartment. Some guy broke in. Jesus, seriously? How... how is she? Is she hurt? Hey. Not good. Oh, my gosh, honey. I'm so sorry. Mm. It's okay. I didn't mean to scare you. It wasn't locked. No, it's all right. Uh... I just, um... I'm just... taking some stuff upstairs. - They got you a new place? - So... Yeah. - Yeah, upstairs. - Oh, that's good. Yeah. Um... Wait. Hey, hey, hold on a second. Hey, come here. Come here. How are you? Okay. You know it's okay to not be okay. I know, I just... I, uh, I've got to pack and Ty loaned me all these bins, and he needs them back by this afternoon, so... I'm trying to hurry and stuff. Marie. Marie, easy. Well, which do you like? Uh... I'm looking for the ones that I had. They were right here. Hmm, maybe they don't have 'em anymore. Um... Hi, excuse me, um... do you know where the green sheets with the little daisies are? They were just here. Everything we have is on the floor. Really? You had tons of them, like, three months ago. Can you just go check in the back? Honey, she said everything they have is out. - It is. - Well, that's what they say at my store, but sometimes there's one or two of something left. It's not enough to put on display, so the manager just sticks it in the back. We don't do that. - Let's just pick another set of sheets. - I don't really want another set. - I want my set. I want the set that I had. - Well, they don't have them. Well, they might. - In back. I'm just asking you to check. - I know what's there. I'm back there all the time. The only thing back there is more of what's out here. - So you're not even gonna look? - Marie, you're being unreasonable. I am? What about her? - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Seriously, you're siding with her right now? I'm not siding with anyone. Let's just chose some sheets and get outta here. I don't want these. I want my sheets. After what happened on them? If I were you, - I'd never wanna see those sheets again. - Well, you're not me! Marie, come on. Your shoes. It's fine. Honey, it's brand new. It's fine. Marie, it's Ty. Oh. Come in. - Hey, Colleen. - Hi, Ty. How you doing, Marie? Good. Look, I'm all moved in. Marie, come on. Get up. You, uh, need anything else right now? Mm. No, I'm good. Thanks. Okay. If that changes, you know where to find me. Okay, cool. Thanks. - Thanks, Ty. - You bet. Marie. Honey. What can I do for you? What do you need? Nothing, I'm good. Sweetie. What happened to you, it's a very big deal. I just want to be sure that you're getting the support you need. I... kinda just wanna put all this stuff away. So you don't wanna talk about it? No, I'll talk about anything. I just wanna... I just kinda wanna get this done. All right. You call me if you need anything, okay? Okay, will do. Hey, Judith, it's me. Yeah, I'm just leaving her place now. Honestly, I have no idea how she is. She seemed... I don't know, fine. Like... like nothing had happened. It was weird that I was even visiting her or something. - Oh, Barlow. I need a copy of a DCFS file. - Yeah. It's for the victim of that sexual assault at the Oakdale. - Got it. I'm on it. - Thank you. Parker. Right, sure. How, uh... How you doing today? Would it be okay if this stayed between us? - You don't want me to take notes? - I'd rather it be in confidence. I don't want it getting back to Marie. Sure, I can do that. I love her, I do. She was with me the last two years. - She came here from Colleen's. - Who's Colleen? Another foster mom. Marie was with Colleen for a couple of weeks before she came to me. Isn't that kind of, um, a short stint? It was an emergency thing. The home Marie was in before was... Well... they had to get her out of there. So, she went to Colleen's, but Colleen had a full house, so she couldn't keep her long-term. - So, she came to you. - Right. And she was my first foster child. I thought they were gonna give me an infant. I had a crib and everything. And then this 16-year-old shows up. Must have been a surprise. Oh, I was fine with it. I love teenagers. I work at a high school in the principal's office, so... I see a lot of them all day long. Got it. So, you know, her behaviors, what she was going through, it was all pretty familiar. Well, it must have made it, uh, easier. For me, I don't know if it did for her. I... I hope it did. My point is, she's had a hard life. And not just the home she came from. But... some of the foster homes too. Has she been in situations you'd call, um... abusive? Some, yeah. And that makes for a very complicated young woman. Then you add this move, being on her own for the first time. How long ago did she move out? About six months ago. And the transition's been hard? It's change. And change is stressful. So, yeah. She has been a little needier. A little more acting out. Acting out how? It's got one of those deals with the hotel and rent. That's inappropriate. Marie! Marie! Honey, settle down. Marie, that's enough. Marie. Hey, hey. Get off the table! Marie! Marie, there are children present. Enough! - Off the table. Right now! - What? - Right now! - Why do I have to... Just a whole lot of what I call look-at-me behavior. ♪...birthday to you ♪ It's okay, honey. And overly sensitive overly contrary. All normal, given the circumstances. Yeah, sure, it's sounds like, uh, a big change. I didn't think she was ready for it. - But she insisted, so I supported her. - Right. So, anyway, yesterday morning she called and told me what happened. - The rape. - Yes. And I was just horrified. Angry, upset, worried... all of it. I went straight over there, right away, and... I don't know. The whole thing just felt... off. Off, how? Just not right. How she was acting and re-acting. Well, you saw her. She was detached, I guess. I think there's a range of reactions to this kind of thing. - I know, believe me. - Hmm. I have my own experience with it. Your own experience? I was sexually assaulted in my 20s. A guy I was dating. - I'm sorry. - Thank you. My point is, I know about this. And given the way she was acting and everything else, I don't know, it just all felt... - Off. - And then those weird details. He brought a blindfold but nothing to tie her with. Would a shoelace even hold her? And then that thing about him taking the picture. - What... what about it? - Well... just hypothetically. Say she's gotten herself into a situation with some boy. And there is a compromising picture out there, or she thinks there might be. Are you saying you think Marie made up the attack? I am not drawing any conclusions. I just... I woke up this morning with all this stuff spinning around in my head, and I thought you guys should have the whole picture. The context. I might not have even called, but then I talked to Colleen, and she said she was feeling weird about it too. So, you both have some doubts about Marie's story? Not doubts. I just thought since I had this... feeling... maybe I had an obligation to share it with you. Can I go now? Sure. Here, I'll walk you out. Let me ask you one thing, so I'm sure I understand. Uh, in your statement you wrote that you tried calling Connor, then called Judith, then cut yourself free. Yeah. In that order. Yeah. All right, thanks again, Marie. You're welcome. She told us you were the first person she called after the attack. Yeah, she told me that too. I felt so bad. I didn't hear it. I don't sleep with my phone in my room. - So, you two are close? - Yeah. Friends, more than friends? Friends. We... We used to date, but... Are you and she sexually active? Um... Not... No, not, not... No. When she called, the morning of the assault, did she leave a message? Mm-mm. - She just hung up. - Can I confirm that on your call log? Oh, uh, sure. Here it is. Thanks. And then, uh, when was it you finally talked to her? She called that night. Um... 10:48. And what did she tell you? That, um, she had been raped. And did she give you any specifics? Yeah. She said that she woke up, and a man was there with a knife. Did she describe him physically? Uh-uh. But I guess after the, um... the rape... um, she said he left. Did she say what happened next? Yeah. I guess she was still, uh... um, tied up. So, she dialed the phone with her toes. With her toes? You sure about that? I mean, yeah, that's what she said. Dialing with your toes. Not really a detail you'd be inclined to forget, you know? The hard evidence we have: the shoelaces are from her shoes, the knife's from her kitchen. No sign of forced entry. No identifiable prints. No body fluids. Hey, Detective, here's that Child and Family Services file. Uh, great. Thank you. Is that hers? Yeah. Aw, man. Jesus. Marie? Marie! What are you doing? Customer needs assistance. - Um... - That's cookware. These are vacuums. I'm sorry. Uh, shoot. Wh... where do these go again? Forget it. Rami. Hello? Marie, it's Detective Parker. Oh, hi. Listen, I was wondering if we could meet again. Why? Am I in trouble? What? She asked if she was in trouble. Hmm. In my experience, when someone asks, "Am I in trouble?" Yeah. They usually are. Okay, I'm gonna cut to the chase. I found some inconsistencies in your statements and those of other witnesses. I... I don't know anything about that. How about you walk me through it again. Tell me exactly how the assault happened. - Again? - One more time, yes. Okay, I... was in bed, asleep. Marie, I'd like to back up a little and talk about what came before all this. DCFS shared your file with us. - Why? - We wanted a clear picture of who you are beyond this assault, as a person. Oh. You've been through a lot. You're a real survivor, aren't ya? I mean, no dad, uh... unreliable mom with not-so-nice boyfriends. Then foster care, which wasn't always much better, I'm sure. Sometimes... sometimes it was good. My point is... you've made it through some very difficult stuff. I don't really like to think about that. I just try to be as... happy as I can be. - And as happy as possible, so... - Sure, I get that. So, help us out. There are inconsistencies in your story. I mean, the dialing alone, we have four different versions: tied, untied, with your hands, with your toes... I dialed with my hands. Then why'd you tell Connor you used your toes? I don't... Maybe I did. - You just told us you didn't. - Well, it's... What? I don't... It's... it's confusing. For us too. And we're not the only ones. W... what do you mean? There are other people who don't know that what you told us about the rape... that it's the truth. - Who? - Well, Judith for one. She said that? And Connor's statement. What... what about it? It's also inconsistent with yours. So, he knows the version you told him. And then he finds out it's not what you told us. It makes it very hard for him to believe you too. He said that he didn't believe me? I don't... Wh... why would he... why would he say that? And then there's the crime scene. I mean, we couldn't find any physical evidence there was anyone else in your apartment that night. But there was. Marie, I want to be really clear about something. We don't think you're a bad person. Absolutely not. And I also don't think this was some big, thought-out thing, but given the inconsistencies in your story and the lack of evidence, this is becoming a puzzle that is hard for us to piece together. Right, so... I'm gonna tell you a version that does fit together. Okay? A young woman, been through a ton of bad stuff, on her own for the first time, just broke up with her boyfriend, feeling isolated, lonely, might... on the spur of the moment, come up with something, without thinking it through, that would get her the attention she needs. 'Cause you haven't gotten enough attention in your life. I can see that. You haven't been cared for or protected, and... that's not your fault. So, Marie... tell us. We need to know. It's our job. Is there really a rapist running around that we should be looking for? Marie? Marie, we can't leave here till you give us an answer. Say it. No. There was no rapist? No one came in your apartment? And the... shoelaces, the knife... you did that? Okay. Thank you, Marie. Can I go now? We need a statement. Right. Uh... Since your other statement's already in the file, we need you to write a new one... with this new information. Okay? Here. Same deal. Fill it out with what you just told us, and then, yeah, you can go home. Well, that's that. - Jesus. - Yeah. I tell ya, I'm glad we caught it early. Remember that case over in King County last year? College student and the history professor? Guy spent a week in jail before she admitted she made it up. Didn't he sue her? I think he did, yeah. I don't blame him. I feel for her though. I mean, Christ, feeding a little girl dog food. Who does that? You can't take care of a kid, use a fucking condom. - God. - Simple. Change? Oh, God. There you go. You have a ride home? I can take the bus. You sure? We can give you a lift. No, that's okay. - I can have these? - Yeah, all yours. Hang on. What is this? This is not what you just said. "I dreamed that I was raped. When I woke up, it felt so real, I believed that it had happened." Marie, what's going on? You just said there was no rape. You just said that. Sit down. Come on, sit back down. Let me explain something. Our job, mine and Detective Parker's, is to protect the public. That's it, that's the whole gig. Time in here with a witness, that's time that we could be out on the street, keeping people safe. Now, that's part of the job, it's fine. We're happy to do it, as long as the time in here is valuable. If it's about something real. This is not a worthwhile use of our time. This is a waste of our time. I'm pretty positive that it happened. Pretty positive or positive? M... maybe I blocked it out. - Marie. - Hmm. You're a smart young woman, clearly. You must understand the way you're handling this... You say one thing, you write another. There is a rapist, there isn't one. It's a dream, it's a blackout. You've told us four different versions. At this point, regardless of what the truth is, the only thing we know for sure is that you have told us at least three lies. What do you think should happen... to someone who would... lie about something like this? I should get counseling? Okay. Okay, what? Okay, I'll write the statement now. Marie? What are you doing? Careful. You're gonna scratch the do... Just wait a second, will you? I'll back the car out. Just let me help you. - Marie. - Like you helped me with the police? What... what does that mean? What does that mean? I don't know what you were told or what you heard, but I did not do... I didn't do or say anything. - Let go. - Listen. This sounds like a big miscommunication. I didn't tell the police anything other than some background on you. I told them about where you'd been and what you'd been through. That's it. I may have told them you've been sensitive lately. But it's true, you have been. Now, don't do that. Don't pull a big disappearing act. We are having a conversation here. Don't just abandon it. Marie! Marie. Marie. Could we talk a sec? I wasn't lying. What do you mean? I told the truth the first time. When you said you were raped? You're saying that was true? - So why did you tell the police it wasn't? - I don't know. I was really tired, and they just kept pestering me. - Pestering? - Yeah. Like, asking me the same question over and over again. "How come your story doesn't add up? How come people don't believe you? Is there really a rapist out there?" I just, I... I... I wanted to go home. If there is a rapist running around and you've told the police there isn't, you need to go back and clear that up, now. - But I gotta go to work. - Marie. This is important. You wanna take back your statement, taking back your statement. Yeah. All right, let's do this again. Detective Parker isn't in today. This is Sergeant Rheinhart. How you doing, Marie? So, let's back up a little. Talk about what caused this turnaround. Did something happen last night when you went home? Did... did they give you a hard time about lying? - No. - Really? 'Cause those guys downstairs, are they your counselors? - Yeah. - Yeah, uh... they seemed kinda pissed off. And I get that. They put all this time and energy into thinking this horrible thing happened. And then find out it didn't. I mean... I remember him on top of me. Marie... I know this is hard. And I'm sorry about that, but I have to remind you of what's already happened. You already told us you lied. You already said you staged evidence. You swore to it. You signed your name. So, given that... how are we supposed to believe you now? I could... I could take a lie detector test. Yeah, yeah... that's right. You could. That's an option. But you need to know, if you take it and fail, that's called making a false statement. It's a crime. So... do you wanna go downstairs for the polygraph? Or do you wanna just... clear this all up with us, in here? Um... maybe... maybe I was, um... hypnotized. You know what? Fine, let's do the polygraph. Let's go. But here's the thing, Marie. The guy running it, he's not going to ask, "Were you hypnotized into thinking you were raped? Did you dream a rape?" He's going to ask you one question. "Were you raped?" That's it. And if your answer turns out to be a lie, I have no choice but to arrest you and put you in jail. Wait, why? Making a false statement is a crime for a reason. It impedes our ability to do our job, to keep the public safe. That's why we enforce it. That's why we prosecute it. I also suspect your living situation, with the counselors and the stipends and all that... you lose all that if you have a record, right? But, like I said, if you want to do a polygraph, you're free to do one. You need to know the risks. But, yeah, the decision is yours. So, what's the story? Nope. Totally made up. Says she didn't think it would turn into such a big thing. - So, we're gonna close the case. - Right. Call me if you have any questions. Yeah, thank you. Why would you do that? Why would you freak us out like that? That's... It's sick is what it is. - You're sick, you are. - You knew how scared this would make us. Guys, let's try to put this in terms of feelings. I'm feeling mad. - Betrayed. - Disgusted. Angry, really, really angry. Marie, do you want to say anything? That's insane. - Amelia. - No. Okay? Just, no.
