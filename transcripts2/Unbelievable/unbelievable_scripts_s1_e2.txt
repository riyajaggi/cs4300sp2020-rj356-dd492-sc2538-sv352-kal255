 Hi. I think I'm in trouble. Can you come get me? Next time get yourself home. I was in my pajamas. Police haven't shared any information about this woman, except to say the claims she made about being raped in this building by a masked intruder were in fact fabricated. Completely made up. Many of the residents in these Oakdale Apartments are part of the Rise Up program, which helps young adults transition while...

 Yeah, Detective Parker. Hey, Detective, Tom Diefenbach, over at Crime Victims Comp. Hey, Tom, how ya doing? Good. While I'm catching up here, I've got a sexual assault from the 11th. Case number L241-007R. Can you send over the crime report and any follow ups, so I can figure out what kind of compensation - the victim's eligible for? - Yeah, don't... don't bother, none. Oh, we cover a lot more than basic medical now. We do mental health expenses, lost wages... Yeah, yeah, not with this one. Uh, it was bogus. She made it up. - What? - Yeah. Total fiction.

 We closed it. I just changed the status in the system. It should disappear from your list in about an hour. - What happened there? - Don't get me started. I mean, the amount of time and energy we spent on this, it's just... pain in the ass. I can imagine. But one less rape in the world. That's ultimately a good thing, right? What's her O2? Ninety-two, but she's breathing fine. Congested, but that's just the cause of the cold. Use the nebulizer. Honey, for now, she's just a kid with a cold. Let's let her sleep. Let her body do its thing. Car 12, do you copy? Okay, one more hour and then nebulize. - Yes, ma'am. - I mean it. I think I just said yes. Go do your job, I got this. Okay, bye. Go for 12. You have a 1035 at the Blackhill Apartments, 1103 Davis. That's 1103 David, Adam, Victor, Ida, Sam. Ten-four, I'm en route. Hey, what do we got? Intruder, sexual assault. That apartment back there, B-4. Happened this morning. She called it in around noon. The victim is Amber Stevenson, 22 years old. Where is she? She was just here. All right, we're moving in three. Never mind. Is everything under there? Amber? - Oh. - Hi. I'm Detective Karen Duvall. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Are you injured physically? Would you like to see a paramedic? No. They checked me out already. I'm fine. Let me know if that decision changes. Sometimes pain can sneak up on you. They're right here. And they're here for you. Okay. If it's all right with you, I'd like to ask you some questions. Sure. It's a little busy out here. Would you be comfortable talking in my car? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, good. That's me right here. Thanks. You okay? You comfortable? Yeah. I'm good. Amber, all our research has shown that the sooner a victim of a crime talks about it, the better his or her recall is, so... if it's all right with you, I'd like to dive right in. Sure. Um, where would you like me to start? Let's start with background. That's your building there? Uh, yeah. Apartment B-4. How long have you lived there? Three months. I moved out here for school. I'm at Tabor College. - What are you studying? - Computer science. Smart. A lot of work in that field. - Mm-hmm. - Where'd you move from? Chicago. You miss it? Yeah. But it's... it's nice here too. You live there alone? Yeah. Okay. Now about today. My colleague Detective Wilson, he says the assault happened this morning. Mm-hmm. Early. Before the assault, can you tell me a little about where you were, what you were doing? Um, I was sleeping. I stayed up really late. My boyfriend was visiting from Chicago and he left yesterday. I always do that when he leaves, stay up late. It's like, all of a sudden, I can't sleep without him, you know? I do. - What's your boyfriend's name? - Eric. Eric Llewyn. Have you told him what happened? Mm-mm. I, um, I haven't told anyone. No parents? No friends? Just you. I mean, 911. Is that weird? - No. - Just, the thing is, um... Eric's super protective of me, so as soon as I tell him, he's gonna to be... Amber, you don't have to explain yourself to me. Who you choose to tell, when you choose to tell them, that is entirely your decision. Just wanted to know. Okay. So you were asleep? In your bed, on the sofa? - In my bed. - Got it. Then what? I saw a guy walking around the complex last night. Stocky, cowboy boots. Never seen him before. There's a guy who lives here I always thought was shady. Walks around with a headlamp on. How's the door? Flimsy. I'm just trying to think if I left anything out. Take your time. Um... yeah. No, I... I think that's everything. And once you realized he was gone, what'd you do then? I called 911. - Even though he told you not to? - Well, yeah. I mean, of course. - Do you know roughly what time it was? - 12:32. I... I checked. I, um, I figured it mattered. You're right. It does. This is very helpful, Amber. The level of detail you're able to remember gives me a lot to work with. - Thank you for that. - Sure. I wanna talk to you about physical evidence. Every rape has three crime scenes. The location of the assault, the body of the attacker, and the body of the victim. Each of them can offer up important information. Now, the hospital will do a thorough exam of your body. But would you be comfortable with me trying to collect DNA evidence from your face now? Yeah. But like I said, he made me shower and wash my face. I... I understand. Still, I'd like to check. Okay. Okay. Thank you. There's one more thing I'd like to ask you to do. Detective. So, anything you remember him touching. Anything he might have touched. Anything at all. Okay. Um, but like I said, he wore gloves. If they're gloves he's worn before, there can be DNA on the outside of them that can transfer. Um, well, the doorknobs definitely. Got those. He peed a few times, so... the flusher thing on the toilet. Um, I... I don't know if he touched the seat. Do you smoke? No. Um... that comforter. He touched that? Yeah. I was cold. He put it over me. Sorry, I forgot to tell you that before. That's okay. That's why we're here. Uh, when did he do that? At what stage? Um, maybe like halfway through. He saw me shivering. So, he covered you, so you'd be warm? Yeah. And, um... like, when he left, he... he told me to put a dowel in my sliding door so that this wouldn't happen to me again. He... he said, "You need to be more protective of yourself." I guess he was right. I know both these nurses. They're great. Well-trained, respectful. Okay. But even so, it's a long exam, and they'll need to examine every inch of your body, inside and out. - I understand. - You're good. I can't stay. I need to get back to the investigation. Is there a friend you'd like to call? Um... - maybe not yet. - Okay. It's just like, then it's this whole thing. You don't need to explain any of your decisions to me. - I know, I just... I do have friends. - Mm. I just... don't feel like talking to them yet. I understand. There's a counselor who will stay with you through the whole exam. She's excellent. If you change your mind and decide that you do wanna call someone, just let her know. Okay. There's just one more thing. Um, about him, about the guy. What's that? Um, he told me this was his first rape, but I don't think that's true. I think he's done this before. Can I get an associate to 29-E? Nice of you to join us. I know, I'm... I'm... I'm really sorry. I, uh... I couldn't... I couldn't get out of my apartment. The door was messed up. The... the doorknob. I... I... just moved in yesterday. I switched apartments and... it got busted somehow. So, I was like... stuck, and I had to call the super and everything. It was... just a mess. - I'm sorry. - Your work day starts at eight. In the future, if you can't get here on time, don't come in at all, okay? Okay. Am I supposed to help myself or what? So sorry. I got it. I only need one. Right. Aren't you supposed to use those? Thanks. Would you like to try a... a sample from our new electric hibachi? - How's it look? - Pretty fucking clean. He knew everything: What classes she was taking, her license plate number, her passport number... He knew she talks to herself in the mirror every night before bed. So he was watching her. A lot. - You got a shoe print? - Partial, just the heel. That mud's soft. Hit it with hairspray first before you take the impression to lock it in place. You got it, Detective. This wasn't his first time in here. - He'd broken in before. - How do you know? She lost a hair ribbon a couple weeks ago. She was sure she put it in a drawer. When she went to go get it... it wasn't there. She figured she'd just misplaced it or something. And then, in the beginning of this whole ordeal, guy reaches into his backpack, guess what he pulls out? - Whoa. - He used it to tie her up. Her own hair ribbon. He brought it for that purpose. That's fucked up. Yes, it is. I got a couple guys out here who could use a rest. - How about we call a bathroom break? - No. Keep working. He raped her for four hours. At gunpoint. She figured her best chance of staying alive was to keep him talking. So she asked some questions about himself, pretended to be curious. Can you imagine the presence of mind? What did she learn? He speaks four languages. He's traveled. Korea, Thailand, Philippines. Military. Maybe. Yeah. He told her his theory of humanity. He said every man's either a wolf or a bravo. Bravos never hurt women or children. Wolves do... whatever they want to whoever they want, regardless of consequence. He's a wolf. I need you to pull all the stranger sexual assaults in our district from the last year. Copy that. - Um... pull all the hot prowls too and the peeping toms. - Will do. - Any, uh, suspicious man calls. Burglaries too. Any burglary within a five-mile radius... - of this Blackhill address. - Okay. That's a lot of files. Yes, it is. - How is she? - Better. Her O2 dropped to 91 at 1:00, but it was back up to 93 by 3:00. And she sounds fine, not gaspy or anything. - I think we're good. - Okay. Good. - And your mom called. - Why does she call during the day? - She knows I'm not home. - 'Cause she knows I am. And she loves me more than she loves you. Hey. You good? Yeah. I'm just, you know... Okay. Well, we're all good here. So, Daisy's at Eve's till 4:00. I'll fill you in on the rest when you get home. Okay. Thanks. Great. The doctor will see you then. Bye. Hi, Detective. - Hey, how's it going? - Almost done. - She's doing great. - Would you let her know I'm here and ask her if she wants me to come in? Make it clear if she doesn't, that's absolutely fine. Will do. Hey, Carmen, Detective Duvall. Is conference room three available? Great, will you block it off for me? The sexual assault at the Blackhill that came in at midday. Thank you. She'd like to see you. Hi, Amber. How you doin'? I'm okay. Good. Did they find anything? The cops? Any evidence or whatever? A few things, it's... it's too early to say if any of it is related to the assailant, but all of it will be thoroughly examined. Okay. He seemed like he really knew what he was doing, you know? He was really careful. Okay, Amber, I've got some medications here for you and some paperwork. We can go through it now if you like. But if you'd prefer to keep resting for a bit, that's fine too. You can do it later. Entirely up to you. Do you know where you wanna go? Um... not home. Okay. Is there a friend you can stay with? Yeah. Um... Yeah, I just, I gotta call her. Sorry. Thank you. Yeah. Um... I... Oh. I, uh... I can't go home. Can I, um... Can I... can I come to you? Can I come stay with you? Is that your family? Yeah. Cute girls. Thanks. What's that? Uh... that's just a little reminder. - Of what? - What I'm doing, I guess. It's from Isaiah. God shows up... looking for someone to be of service. Clean things up a bit. He says, "Whom shall I send?" So, this is my cell. Just call anytime. Okay. Okay, I'm making dinner, and there's a hot bath waiting for you, and a cup of tea and some wine. I didn't know which you'd want. Thank you for taking care of her. Get some rest. I'll be in touch. Three suspicious males mentioned by the neighbors. We tracked down one. He was at work all morning. Confirmed by coworkers, boss, and video. Another was in a Winnebago parked in front of the complex for a few days. It had moved on by the time of the assault, but we're following up. And the third is a resident of the complex who wasn't home when we knocked. This will all be in the reports. - Which I'll get by... - It'll be ready by the morning. - I got my guys working on 'em now. - Tell 'em to be thorough. If I get one like that piece of garbage Inky filed on the B and E... - I'll make sure. - You saw that thing, right? It's practically scrawled on a cocktail napkin. He's aware. It won't happen again. Good. - Thank you. - Yeah. I don't know if he made a noise, or if I just sensed him there, but all of a sudden, I was wide-awake. Do you know what kind of gun it was? I don't know about guns. If you scream, I'll kill you. I have money. Fuck you. Take those off. - Then he dressed me up. - How? He wanted me to look like a hooker. And like a little girl. - Both. - Lie down. Here you go, Detective. Then he started. And then he would just stop. He did that eight times. Stopped and then started again. - And each time he just sat there? - Or took pictures. He was white. Around six-two, 170, 180 maybe. - So fairly lean. - Yeah. But with a belly, like he wasn't in shape. He was wearing black sneakers, gray sweatpants with holes in the knees. He had blond hair on his arms and legs, but his pubic hair was shaved. And he has a birthmark. A big one. Where? His left calf? Or looking at him, was it on your left? His left. You sure about that? Yes. Marie. Got a minute? Yeah. How you doing, Marie? - I'm okay. - Work's okay? Classes okay? Yeah, work's good. Yeah. I didn't get to make it to that photography class. I was just, um... But I... I'll... I'll just go next week and email the teacher to find out what I missed. Okay, sounds good. So, listen. I hope you know by now how much we love you here. Yeah. We think you're awesome. And we're serious about the commitment we made to you. To this whole transition out of foster care. It's hard. Nobody expects it to be seamless. Lots of our kids hit bumps in the road. - Most of them. - Most of them, yeah. And this whole thing definitely qualifies as a bump. Right? But that's what we're here for. The thing is, we also have an obligation to this community. To the agreements that hold it together. And the most important of those is that we be straight with each other. Can't have community without trust, right? So, not surprisingly, this whole thing has shaken people's trust in you. So we need to address that. Make some changes to restore that trust. Wh... what kind of changes? We're gonna cut back on some of your freedoms. Knock your curfew back an hour. Not forever, but for the time being. And we're going to do mandatory daily check-ins. Why? I think better communication will help you to stay on track. And it'll help us get in there early and help you process things before they get out of hand. - So nothing like this happens again. - It won't. We just want to have a mechanism in place. Well, why? It... it... it's... It's stupid. Why would I do that again? It's not like it did me any good. I mean, everyone hates me. - I can't even leave my apartment. - It's important for other kids to see there are consequences to your actions. Oh, so this is about them. It has nothing to do with me. It's for all of us. - That's bullshit. - Nine o'clock curfew. Nightly 8:45 check-in with whoever's on duty. Hey, sweetheart. Hi. When I heard the noise, I thought you were the raccoons. - Oh, no, it's... it's just me. - Hey, hey. Come here. Come here. How you doing, kiddo? I'm so sorry, honey. God. Um... I thought maybe if I could watch The Bachelor with Colleen, it would, um... - I don't know, it would, you know... - Take your mind off stuff. - Yeah. Yeah. - I guess, yeah. It's a good idea, but she's not here. She's out at a neighborhood meeting. Um... Okay. Well, maybe I could just, uh, wait for her. Uh, I think she's gonna be out late, hon. I mean, their agenda was, like, a mile and a half long. Okay? Well, then I can just, um... I can watch it by myself. I don't think that's gonna work either. Um... Marie, hon. You know, I love you. It's just that right now, on the heels of all this stuff, it's probably better... for you and me not to spend time together when Colleen's not around too. Why? We're foster parents, Marie. We can't have the slightest blot on our record. Okay, so I... I'm... I'm a blot? No, honey. God, no, you're wonderful. You know I think the world of you. Look, it... I'm not a psychiatrist. I don't know what made you say that thing about being attacked. And I'm not judging. After all you've been through and all you've overcome, hey, even the strongest, best-adjusted kid is gonna come out of that with some complicated stuff. And again, no judgment. I get it. It's just that... If you were to ever say anything like that about me... It's not personal. Marie, please, you gotta understand that. I just have to think of myself and of all the kids we want to be able to help here. Like you were once. Yeah? Honey, when Colleen's around, you're more than welcome, anytime. Hey, ev... even later tonight would work. - Yeah? - Uh... I'll tell her to call you when she gets home. That's good. I'm okay. - I'm sure she won't mind coming to pick... - I'm all right. Hello. I'm Detective Duvall with the Golden Police Department, investigating an assault that happened in this complex this morning. Do you have a couple minutes to talk? Mom! I heard about it from my neighbor Jenny when we got back this afternoon. I just... I can't... When you got back from where? A camping trip with some friends. We do it every year. - How long were you gone? - Just four days. A long weekend. - We? That's you and... - Me and Rowey. Yeah, it's just us two here. One small, happy family. Was it a self-guided trip, or... or did you use an outfitter? Oh, self-guided. Those outfitters, they'll cost an arm and a leg. Yeah, no kidding. So your friends can confirm you were both there? Why would they need to do that? - Did someone accuse Rowey of this? - No. - No one has accused him of anything. - But someone mentioned him. Mrs. Wilson, when something like this happens and people feel suddenly unsafe... - My son's not a rapist, Detective. - Did not say he was. You know, if one person in this complex had taken the time to get to know him, - it really doesn't take much. - Mrs. Wilson... I've known a lot of men, Detective, and it's never the oddballs, okay? It's the guys that look nice. The ones that offer to carry your groceries and buy you a drink. Those are the ones that turn around and mess you up. That's who we were camping with. Unless you have any other questions... Hey. Hey. Oh, sorry. It's, uh, it's okay. They were hungry. Did she eat? A little. ♪...My one desire ♪ ♪ You got my love Growing higher and higher ♪ ♪ You had... ♪ I just took it. Ninety-four. - Hey, that's not bad. - No, I think we're good. This is good. Thank you. I didn't make it. She did not. She did say it was for all of us. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. You and your inconvenient family? We're moments away from her showing up here in a bikini, saying she locked herself out of her house and can you please come help her, you big, strong police officer? She's lonely. Everyone's lonely. A new case? You wanna talk about it? I fixed that drip. Oh, shoot. - I was gonna do that. - I did a half-ass job. It'll need to be redone in, like, a day. It's a rape. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Then when he's finally satisfied with her scrubbing, he lets her out of the shower but tells her to stay in the bathroom until he leaves. Which she does. When she hears the door click, she comes out, he's gone. So was almost everything he touched. Her bed sheets, her pillow covers... I sent a couple things out to the lab, but from the scene itself, nothing. Not a hair. Not a fluid. Nothing. Clean. He felt smart. Yeah, but you're smarter. He took pictures. The whole time. Horrible pictures of her tied up, splayed out. Said if she told anyone, he'd post them online with her name and everything. She called us anyway. And I asked her why. She said 'cause she knows he's gonna do it again to some other girl. And she couldn't live with herself if she didn't at least try to keep that from happening. She is one brave young woman. Did he have a backpack? What? The guy. When he did it. Was he wearing a backpack? - Yeah. Why? - We had one like that. - You should call our detective. - Who is it? ♪ Girl, it just ain't right ♪ ♪ Don't be shy now ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're all alone ♪ ♪ Let me give you something ♪ ♪ That'll shake your bones ♪ Holy, what the... - Oops, did I scare you? - Jesus. Fuck! Would... - Would you get that thing out of my face? - Oh, sorry about that. What the fuck? You know what's funny? I was just asking myself the same question. What the fuck? What the fuck is a grown man doing crawling through the woods, dressed head to toe like a goddamn SWAT team member, in the middle of the night, behind a building where a woman was raped last month? What? I have no idea what you're talking about. Who the fuck are you anyway? Grace Rasmussen, detective, Westminster PD. More importantly, friend, who the fuck are you?
