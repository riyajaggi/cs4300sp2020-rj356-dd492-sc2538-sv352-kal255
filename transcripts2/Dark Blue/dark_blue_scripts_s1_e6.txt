It's between me and tough guy. - You stole my dresses. No, I bought them from my uncle in Long Beach. Go take walk, get coffee or somethin'. No need for you to get involved. Don't nobody steal from Joe Bell. And damn sure don't hit him with a shotgun! Joey, listen to me! Listen to me, Joey! You wanna shoot this guy over a bunch of dresses? - He robbed me! Alright, fine.

Guess today's your lucky day, ace. Yeah, guess it is. - Twenty bucks a dress. - Would you.. Who knew stealing dresses could be so dangerous? Yeah, ha ha. When you're done with the jokes, we got lots to do. We gotta find something to sell to Tivnan. He's not exactly in love with me at the moment. You and Scott still going strong, huh? Yeah. Things are good. Real good. Seems like a real nice guy. I know. I'm lucky. Don't screw it up. What? Nothing. What happened with Tivnan? It went great... until he called me a punk told me to get the hell out of his store. Go back, kiss his ass, buy him lunch, wash his car. Just get him to trust you. He's our in with Briggs. Wait. Wait a minute. Dollar Bill Briggs? - Big-time diamond fence. Helps scumbag criminals convert their filthy millions into beautiful, pristine diamonds. Easy to find bank accounts not easy to find, safes filled with ice. How does Tivnan fit into all this? Grew up in the same neighborhood. Worked together back in the day before Briggs hit it big. Why not go to Briggs directly? Because he's smart. Only does business with friends and only does deals north of two mil. - Something like that. Maynard wants this guy so bad. He's been chasing him for years. Thinks he might move to London So he's giving us the green light. Only caveat.. ...don't shoot any unarmed nuns. We're gonna get inside with these jewel thieves The Rippers, and use them to steal the diamonds. Then use Tivnan to set up a meeting with the almighty, untouchable Bill Briggs. And bust all their asses at the same time. What's this dude's name, again? It's my cousin, Rudy. My second cousin. He was at our wedding. You know him. Oh, yeah. Fat boy, funny walk. So I pay 125 bucks for a nice tuxedo to watch his fat ass waddle down the aisle. - He's family. - Better be an open bar, there. Hey, um, did you call that guy for the air No, but I will. You know, the mortgage is due tomorrow. Anything else? Yeah. I want a baby. Before or after I pay the mortgage? I'm serious. I know. So, why don't we, um, get started now? What are you doing? Excuse me, babe. - Mmm. - Mmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm. Got it. Hello? Yeah. This afternoon? Carter? Mmm-hmm. 'So, who's my in?' Her name's Liz. She's single. 'Brother owns the place.' 'Wheeler dealer, named Tommy Franco.' Does business with that jewel gang, The Rippers. Wheelman, lookout, runner, nothing too heavy. So if you can get to Liz, you can get to Tommy. I'll have the same thing. So, um.. ...how long you been working here? I'm kind of busy. Huh. I haven't been blown off that fast since, uh, let me see, Amy Harper, sixth grade. Well, can I at least have your name? Liz. Kemba. Should've started with that. Cool name. What time you get off? Ahem. Direct. I like that. You got to get off at some point. So "a businessman who deals in imports and exports." You might as well just say "hustler." If I didn't have such a strong sense of self I would think you were insulting me. Well, the good news is is you don't have to work so hard. 'Cause I don't date hustlers. Charmaine, the receipts. Boyfriend? Brother. He owns the place. So does he do anything else? You know, to pay the bills around here? Why don't we go back to my place? Check. Undercrush. Name of the clothing line I'm starting. Oh, impressive. It's not, um, it's not easy to start a business. Yeah, it's not cheap, either. So, how do you, uh, how do you pay for this business? Huh. My brother. Once he pays back the money he owes at the bar. But, um.. "But, um" what? Tommy's not exactly the most reliable person in the world. He has a hard time getting from point A to B. Legally, anyways. Well.. ...I would, uh.. ...I would like to meet him. You here to screw Tommy or me? You have to start working on your shyness. Life's too short to be subtle. I thought you didn't date hustlers. Doesn't mean I don't sleep with them. Wow! That's beautiful. I made it. Undercrush. Sexy lingerie without all the frills and pretense. Mission accomplished. Excuse me. Hello? Come on, man. It's, like, midnight. Okay. Yup, see you there. That was my, uh, business partner. - He needs us to meet. Bad timing, I know. Rain check? See.. ...if we keep that up it's gonna be very hard for me to leave, Liz. Okay with me. My partner would not be too thrilled about it. Liz, I got a business proposition.. ...I think your brother will be interested in. - Yes. Why Tommy? 'Cause I need somebody likable, connected big reputation. He has all three. I don't really get involved in that part of his life. This is a hell of an opportunity and absolutely risk-free. Nothing's risk-free. With this one deal, he can make enough money to pay off his loan and start your business, Undercrush. Guaranteed. Is that why you came here? So I could introduce you to Tommy? In part, yeah. It's so much easier when you just tell the truth. So does that mean you'll tell him? You'll set it up? It means I'll tell him you were askin' about him. After that, it's up to him. I've got the perfect score. Tivnan's gonna love it. One thousand counterfeit handbags leaving the port of Los Angeles at 12:45. "Meyer South Transportation" will be written on the side of the truck. Nice. "Nice" I don't do high fives. Sorry. Meet you at the corner of 5th and Fig, that coffee shop. Give me 30 minutes? I can wait. It's no big deal. You got any coffee, babe? Oh. Sorry. I didn't know someone was here. No, it's alright. I just made it. It's on the counter. Oh, this is my, uh, my friend, Naomi. Naomi, Jaimie. Naomi. Sorry. I'm not good with fancy names. Meet you at 5th and Fig. I love the smell of fresh leather. Reminds me of my first baseball glove when I was a kid. Yeah. Well, I got 1,000 brand new, same smell. Remember the best part was breaking it in? Rub leather conditioner all over put the ball in the pocket wrap it tight with rubber bands stick it under your mattress for a few days. Yeah. Childhood, right? I can do 20 bucks a bag, as a favor since you saved my ass the other day. Thank you. I'm gonna pass. What do you mean? These bags are perfect. They are. They're perfect. But you're a cowboy and I don't I don't do business with cowboys. I'm too old. I got too many bills to pay. I-I like adults.

Just red wine. 'Good.' Three.. ...million dollars. Okay. You got my attention. I need a crew... a real crew. The diamonds will be in a safe for two more days so...we need to move fast. - Nothing fancy. Steel safe. We need pros, Tommy. People who can cut locks, drill, navigate around glass plates..

Only thing is they can.. ...they can be a little hard core. Not afraid to, uh.. ...you know, take care of business. Head man's name is Dan Kemp. Not too funny, but he's good. We're stealing diamonds, not making a sitcom. You feel me? Give me two hours. I'll set it up. Beautiful. I sell insurance to diamond dealers. When someone has a big shipment coming in they increase their coverage. Two days ago, a client of mine increased his coverage from 100,000.. ...to three million. - Patience, Danny. Patience. To write a policy that big I have to personally see the diamonds myself and.. get a certified gemologist to take a look at them. - Company rules. - Mmm-hmm. And this gemologist said three million dollars? Three.. ...point three. It's a nice number. Who are you gonna sell them to? Dollar Bill Briggs. What's so funny? You know him, huh? Let's just say we have.. ...mutual acquaintances. Tommy says you're good with safes, Dan? - Uh, I meant great. You meant the best. Cocky. This guy's cocky. I like cocky. Yeah, it ain't cocky if it's the truth. So...we're in. You got a business card? What, you looking for a number? No. Looking for a business card. I've never met an insurance broker 'who didn't carry a business card, huh?' Jack Scola, insurance broker to the stars. You call anytime. I'm always up. Tommy. Man, can you sell. I was about to ask you for a quote on a term life policy. - Hey, girl. - Hey. Hey. Liz, Jack Scola. Jack Scola, Liz. Hi. - Nice to meet you, Liz. - Nice to meet you, too. - We had sex last night.

We didn't do a damn thing. Like I said, your business. - Hey, Dan. What's going on? I looked up your company. I didn't see a listing at 345 Castle Street. What's that have to do with me? That's the address on your card. Company headquarters is in Century City. Jack Scola Insurance is 345 Castle. Why don't we take a ride, just to be sure? - You don't wanna do the deal-- - Let's take a ride. Dan, if you're getting cold feet I'm happy to find someone else to do this deal. Just save the speech. Open the door. Hundred bucks says he's lying. Come on, come on, come on. Okay okay okay. Yeah, that's the one. There we go. Anything else? Jack Scola Insurance, Suite 215. You, uh, want to come up for a drink? Order up a few girls? It's called due diligence, Jack. - I'm sorry for the hassle. - Dan, I get it. I hope you rob as thoroughly as you check out business cards. You scared me, you son of a bitch. I thought you were gonna shoot me. Almost gave me a heart attack. And you, oh, man! - That's right. Yeah. Me, too. You go to Venice High? I did, indeed. Who was the football coach when you went there? I have no idea. 'The truth is..' ...I didn't go to school that much, so.. 'Hated it.' Well...I wasn't much of a scholar, myself. I love your ring. Oh, uh, thank you. Nick picked it out all on his own. You've very good taste. Thank you. You, too. How long have you two been together? - Yeah, two years. Big wedding? No, not really. How about you? Got a guy? Getting married soon, aren't you? No. Whoa. Slow down, there. No, not soon. You study first. You play later. He's been saying that to me since I was two-years-old. It worked, right? It worked. She's going to Stanford? She leaves next week. Really? You're going to Stanford? - Yeah. ' Her old man didn't even graduate the 10th grade and...she's going to Stanford. I love this country. You sure this meeting's just about the split? According to Tommy. Hey, girl. Where you been hiding? Where have I been hiding? What do you mean? I called three times. Yeah, right. Oldest trick in the book. I've play that game myself sometimes. On that note, I'm gonna grab a cocktail. Good seeing you again, my brother. - See you in a few. - Okay, Jack. You wanna cash in that rain check tonight? I can't. I'm doing business with your brother. Tommy doesn't own me. I date and screw who I want. I can't. Sorry. You're lying. Look, I know you're not used to dudes saying no, but-- Sit down. Yes or no? Are you lying? I'm married. Things with my wife are, um.. ...they're complicated and I thought about playing around but I feel I need to deal with my issues the right way, Liz. Guys usually give you that speech after you've had sex. Look, are you and Tommy still working on that business proposition? I prefer not to talk about that. I know it sounds crazy, but I had a dream last night a bad one, about Tommy. Just...find someone else. Tell him the deal's off. Tommy's a big boy. He can make his own decisions. 'I say "Scotland." Oh! Come on! I still can't believe you guys beat us. Paul and I never lose. What are you looking at me for? Well, we've only been together for two years so every moment is magnified. Isn't that right, honey? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, what can I say? She's the best. Well, you hold on to her... with both hands. I will. Gonna take her with me, too. We should go. It's getting late. - Thank you for dinner. - Our pleasure. Hey. My wife likes you. Yeah? Well, I like her, so it's even. She's a good judge of character. And the truth is, honestly I don't do business with anyone unless she approves. Hey. Is this your brother? 'No, that's funny you say that.' A lot of people think that's my brother. No no. We just look alike. That's my friend for 32 years. - He looks familiar. - Bill Briggs. Never heard of him. Oh, he's a great guy, loyal friend. And richer than god. Ha ha. Hey, um.. ...if you're interested, I could use help tomorrow. Gotta move some cashmere sweaters. Absolutely. After we take care of that, let's talk about those handbags. I've been strapped for cash lately. This Stanford thing, it's killing me. - The offer is on the table. - Okay. As long as we get our 50, I'm good. Cool. That leaves us 30%, Tommy. We split it right down the middle, brother. Hey, it's official! I'm having a boy! Hey, hey. Congrats, Mick. I was praying for a boy. 'I couldn't tell my wife that.' - Yeah. I hope to have a lot more. I mean, I love kids. 'Hey, Dan' 'I was thinking, you know' I should probably sit this one out. - The heist. That's not how we do things. Yeah, I know, but I'm having a kid. It wouldn't feel right, you know? 'I got new responsibilities. I can't--' Can't what? Huh? Spit it out! Come on, man. I told you last month I might want out. I told you last month... what you need to do to get out. I thought you were kidding. Do I look like Jerry Seinfeld to you You take a risk getting in. 'You're gonna take a risk getting out.' It's up to you, Mickey. Oh, fu.. You're free to go. 'Hey!' Don't come back. Still hate Mexicans? Everything okay? Just glad that Mickey dude found an empty chamber, Carter. 'Cause I was this close to screaming, "L.A.P.D." and putting a bullet in Kemp's head. It all worked out. Mickey's still breathing. We didn't blow our cover. Guess that's all that matters. Melissa wants a baby. She wants a baby. Makes you think this Mickey dude only had to play Russian roulette once. We play it every day. - Yeah, think so. Helping him sell some cashmere sweaters today, so.. Heist is going down tonight. Without Tivnan, we got no Briggs. He'll be in my back pocket by this afternoon. There's three grand in the safe, if you need. Love it. Sold 100 this morning to a friend, 30 bucks a pop. Come on. That's great! Here here here. No. No no no. First one's on the house. You are a good guy, Nick. Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on. Ah. It's my buddy bones. This poor bastard. Goes on trial tomorrow. Grand larceny. Come on! Got busted in some undercover sting. Some people, they got no conscience, huh? They ruin someone's life in the blink of an eye. Come on, let's get something to eat, huh? I'll buy. You got it. Hey, your daughter, Kara, she's great, man. Uh, my wife and I were very impressed. I don't know if you noticed but I'm awfully damn proud of her. That's why I do all this...for her. Honestly, it makes it all worthwhile, yeah? Come on. Let's get something to eat. 'Silent alarm, 15 minutes.' Plenty of time. Let's go get us some diamonds. Fellas. Bingo. That's a tempered glass re-locker, spring-loaded bolts. Piece of cake. Come on. Come on, Kemp. You said it's a piece of cake. Let's go. Hey. What are you doin'? Checkin' out everything back here. - Cover the front door. - I'm watching the back. Who the hell is that? - Yo yo yo. Come on, man. - No witnesses. It's an old man crying, with his face down. - Doesn't matter. - It's my deal. So I say when someone gets shot, alright? Shoot his ass, or I will. Then I'll shoot you. All set! Let's move. Now! Shoot him, Kemba. Let's go! - To a job well done. - Oh. Yeah. - Very well. - Mmm. We need to do some more business together, Jack. Tommy says you guys were good. Damn! I mean, really. All we need to do is sell the stuff? Ah. I'll call Briggs tomorrow. This'll be done. Danny, can I talk to you for a second? - Tommy's safe. - No. But they need us to broker the deal with Briggs, so.. Alright. Now, you see that? What did I tell you? I said there was nothing to worry about. Hope it was worth it. Liz, I'm almost done. Okay to have a drink with a customer? - Him. - The nicest. - Hell, yeah. If I can save enough money, I'll spend a full year there. Travel on the weekends, take classes. Sounds amazing. Yeah, and plus, you're right in the middle of Europe. You can go to London and Amsterdam, Barcelona. Don't forget Prague, Budapest. - Oh, whenever I can. It's-it's like my therapy. I love exploring different cultures, different lifestyles. I can't wait. I've never really gone anywhere. The furthest east I've ever been is Las Vegas. - You're kidding. - No. Well, I'll take you to Rome. I know a great hotel there above the Spanish steps. The most amazing cannolis you ever had in your life. I would love to go to Rome. Why don't we get together tomorrow night and talk about it? Wow. I'd like that. Okay. Ah...was a late night with Alex, I hope? Went home alone, as usual. Just talked to an informant. Word on the street Kemp is looking to move three million diamonds. Briggs is the biggest buyer there is. Why the hell would he be trying to find a new fence? - No one on the dot. Alright, tell Kemp I had to leave town for a few days. But let him know I talked to Briggs and that he's interested in doing the deal. So, Dan, I was telling Tommy earlier my main man Jack met with Briggs today. Briggs says he is ready to party 55 cents on the dollar. Oh, well, that's great Briggs ain't the only guy in L.A. that likes diamonds. - I thought we agreed to, uh.. - I changed my mind. Whoa! Whoa whoa whoa! - Open the safe, Tommy. - You're kiddin'! Open the damn safe. Come on, Danny. I-I thought we were friends. Mistake. Open the safe or I'm gonna shoot you and drill through it myself. Move. Nice knowing you, Tommy. Put the down, Tommy. Put it down. You're under arrest. You're a cop? I'd like to propose a toast. Everybody, please. To Kara. Thank you for being such a great daughter and for making your mom and me so proud. To Kara! 'To Kara. Whoo!' I'll be right back. Hey, where you going? Oh, yeah, I gotta meet somebody about a new job. Always business with you. I like that. - It was a beautiful party. - Yeah, man, it's a great party. I'm a blessed guy. I'm a lucky guy. Till the tuition bill comes. Hey. The meeting set with Briggs? - Not yet. - Ty and I had to make a bust. - So, we're on a clock. Protective custody, but we can't keep them there forever. What's the problem? Briggs is the bad guy. He's the target. He's laundering all this dirty money for these drug dealers and gun runners. - Tivnan's a decent guy, Carter. He's got a wife, kid. Hell, he saved my life. Why jam him up in all of this? By introducing us to Briggs, he's looking at serious time. You got another way to get a meeting with Briggs? No. Make the deal. Never get close to the family. You know that. - Oh! - Hey. Look at you. You're in a good mood. You win the lottery? Yeah, sort of. Got you coffee. Yeah. Oh, good good good. So my friend, this guy named Kemba has just pulled off a major score three million in diamonds. - Yeah. He's looking for a buyer, so if you know anyone.. Mmm. He's offering a 10% referral fee, too. How well do you know this guy, Kemba? Hey, man, we're tight. Grew up in the same neighborhood. You know somebody? - I might. Hey, man, 10% divided by two. I mean, I'm no math major but I bet you that's at least a year's tuition. - Good to see you, buddy. - Nice to see you. - I've been good. Thank you for that much-too-generous graduation gift you gave Kara. - Oh, absolutely. My pleasure. - Shouldn't have done that. I want you to meet my friend right here. This is Nick, his friend, Kemba. How you doing? - Hey. - I'm good. - Good. - I hear Kemba has ice to sell. - Yes, he does. Alright. Why don't you guys meet me in the back, huh? - They're good. - Come on, it's perfect. Except for the fact that there's no certification. Ah, minor detail. 'That's the problem with stealing.' You never have time to ask for the paperwork. We can pay 12,000 a carat. We open a foreign account, my client transfers money. Simple. - Sounds like we have a deal. - Got a deal. Alright. L.A.P.D.! You're under arrest! Come on! Good work. I'll call Maynard and make sure Tivnan gets a fair shake. 'Dinner's ready.' melancholic music] You okay? For the record, I had a bad day, too. I just need some time alone, babe. Is this how it's gonna be when we have kids? 'You coming home, not talking' 'just getting wrapped up in your tortured little bubble'' Okay. Hello? Hey, Alex. It's Jack. Hey. I won't be able to make it tonight. Something's come up. I'm real sorry. Okay. ["Dark Blue" Theme by Graeme Revell]
