 Dark Blue (2009â€“2010): Season 1, Episode 7 - O.I.S. - full transcript 
 Even Carter's team wonders why he's so eager to prove highly respected, efficient lieutenant Jay Frye, about to be promoted captain of a special division, guilty of corruption, working from a killed dealer's unsubstantiated allegations that he unconditionally protects major drug trade baron Terry Isaiah, motive unknown. Posing as a rogue rookie, Ty, whose wife thinks they're pregnant, gets recruited in Frye's team. Its seems to be upright police work, on the edge like their own, yet at a party Chavez comes warn him and exposes a deceptive, apparently almost excessive loyalty.

 Move, you gotta get outta here! I can't. They got me pinned down. Let's go! I got you, come on! Go! What the hell happened to you? Walked myself into an armed robbery. - Nah, they both got away. - Well, that's too bad. - Yeah. - You look okay. - Yeah. I'm good. Fine. - This is, uh.. - Ty Curtis.

 Yeah. I've seen you around the station. I transferred in three weeks ago. - Yeah, I was around the corner. They had me pinned down, Frye. Guys were cold-blooded. They were gunning for me. Weren't for Ty, I'd be dead. - Good job. - Thank you, sir. - Yeah. Let's go get a drink. - Thanks, man. - Yeah. Can't stay out of trouble, can you? I was hungry. Came a little close with some of those shots? Had to make it real if Chavez's gonna buy it.

 Did he? Like a ticket to his favorite show, brother. - He showed up after y'all. He had to shoot up a liquor store. I'd have done it weeks ago, if I knew it. Hey, man, Frye runs a tight unit. They treat him at the station house like he walks on water. He doesn't! I promise you that. - Told me to hand in reports. Good. Use that. Make sure you cover Frye's man. - You mean Chavez. - Report makes him look good. That'll show you're not afraid to get dirty. - I'll try. - You don't feel bad about.. ...investigating other cops? The whole blue wall brotherhood of the cops? Exactly how long have you been investigating Frye? I put Ty in Metro Division as a lateral transfer few weeks ago. Why? Frye is one of the most highly decorated officers on the force. ' - Name's Osiri. He was one of my informants. He told me about a con named Terry Isaiah. Manufactures and sells meth and ecstasy. Rumor has it, that his operation ran untouched because he had a cop in his pocket. Frye. I see. So, now we're takin' the word of criminals over cops? Four days after I talked to him Osiri was killed in a drug raid led by Frye's task force. Thing is, Osiri didn't sell drugs. Do you know how many times Frye's been investigated by IAD? And every time they get nothin'. Have you, uh, seen his arrest record? I need you to transfer someone out of Frye's task force to make room for Ty. You know they're promoting Frye to captain. God, how good you look in uniform! I thought you married me because of my charm. No. It's the uniform. So, um, how much longer you got on this one, babe? Well, hopefully, not much longer, babe We might not even have a case. It's too bad, because I kinda like these cases. You'd stay home. Predictable hours. I'm just saying, you might wanna be a little careful now that I'm-I'm pregnant. Did I hear you right? Did you say, you're pregnant? Yeah? Don't get too excited, because I did two home pregnancy tests and one came out positive one came out negative. You couldn't go for a tie No, I'm not gonna know anything for sure until I get in to see my doctor. - I gotta get in the shower. - Okay. Relax. This isn't the Marines. I was telling Frye how impressive you were in shooting. Chavez told me you were, like, Wyatt Earp, last night. 'But, uh, I was more impressed with your report.' Like when you said the shooters turned on Chavez without provocation. Well, uh, how would you know that if you came in after the shooting started? I don't make pricks who shoot at me sympathetic, sir. Yeah, I looked into your record. Says they pulled you from the academy for a special assignment. Yes sir, it was an undercover case. With all due respect, the detective was an idiot. Almost got me killed. Is that why you're in uni? I'm in uni, because I punched a fool in the face. Stuck me in Devonshire division, it took eight months to transfer back into Metro. One of the men of my Task Force got transferred out. 'That leaves me with a slot open'' That any uni in the division would give his left nut to fill. We need guys who can get it done. 'We have the highest rates of conviction in the city.' You stick with me for a year 'you can have any assignment you want.' Leave the mortician outfit home, tomorrow. You go in soft clothes. Let's see what you got. Congrats, bro. You just got yourself a trial. It's the bad-ass unit in the department. These are all the arrest reports for Frye's task force. The one name you never see in these reports Terry Isaiah. So he's fallen under the radar. Or someone turns the radar off. Isaiah's a big player, deals in ecstasy and meth. You break down Frye's arrests, everyone of Isaiah's competitors were either arrested, or wound up dead. There's a pattern here, like Frye's in Isaiah's pocket. Still don't understand is, why Ran a financial check on Frye. Nothing seems unusual. So we take Isaiah, get him to flip on Frye? Too risky. If Isaiah doesn't flip, then we're blown. Not to mention the convicted drug-dealer's word against a big-time cop. We need to catch Frye in the act. 'Put pressure on Isaiah's operations.' Force him to use Frye. Then, we catch Frye capering for Isaiah and bam, we got 'em. We're gonna need some help. I do not know. That man has more love than Gandhi. Nobody from Metro's gonna help us. What makes you think I'd go to cops for help? Take a walk! Police! Easy. Easy! Easy. Carter, you gonna get yourself killed rolling up in here. 'Would you've answered if I knocked?' No. These two would've smoked you. Yeah. - Losing a step. Ah. - Chill out. - It's okay. 'If you're lookin' for a new ride, these aren't for sale.' 'These are part of my private collection.' I need help with something. I told you, I don't snitch for anyone, even you. I don't need information. I need help busting someone. A cop. Lieutenant. They teach you any other languages out there in the Devonshire division? Can you read that? That's better than the LA Times. You're standing in the most heavily contested gang hood in the city. See those names? You know what they mean? "187. Hit list." People the gang's targeted for murder. That's right. What about those numbers? 'If you earn a spot up there' that means you're doing something right. Let's go to work. I'll ride with you. You ever been here before? No. I didn't even know Carter had a house. Don't you think it's a little strange that we're only seeing it when he's entertaining criminals? - It's printing. Do you think it was a good idea, bringing these guys home? Well, I wasn't gonna bring them to the office. Here he is. He's the dirty cop Isaiah has. Lieutenant Jay Frye. Isaiah uses him as his muscle. His own private police. Any time something or someone threatens his business we think, he puts Frye on it. So, we need to disrupt that business. You find out anything? Isaiah's got a lab, up in the canyon. What kinda security are we talking about, here? Anywhere from six to eight guys. - 'And they come heavy.' - That's why I need your help. 'The three of us can't cover them all.' Gonna need full benefits. Fine. 'Good.' When we gonna do this? - Oh, baby. Sorry, I'm late. - It's okay. Been busy? Well, yeah. Hmm. Babe, we got a.. We got a...got a tip about a stash house, right? - Uh-huh. - We took it down. Took in some major weight. I gotta say, working with these guys they really know what they're doin'. Sounds like you had a good time. And then, felt kinda good, not havin' to sneak around. Uh-huh. I actually felt.. ...proud to make the bust. You get to the doctor? The doctor's out of town for the next few days. - Hmm. - And I...I don't know. A part of me is really enjoying the idea of being pregnant even if I'm not. Oh, can you imagine? Do we even have room in this house? They're the size of a football. What about work? Well, we'll figure it out. Remember what we agreed on? Yes, I remember. - Lieutenant. No, no. Come on in. Melissa. Lieutenant Frye. Lieutenant Frye, this is my wife Melissa. - How do you do. - Hi. People just call me Frye. - You have a lovely house. - Thank you. Umm, can I offer you something to drink? Ah, no. Thank you. Your, uh, your husband showed some, uh real smarts, today. We're gonna make him a serious crime fighter. Just as long as you keep him safe. Oh, I will. My wife and I are having a get-together, tomorrow. It's wives, kids. You two should come by, meet the family. Sounds great. Why don't I let you two guys talk. - It was so nice to meet you. - Nice meeting you. House. Wife. Nice job, Curtis. I'm very lucky, sir. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. And lieutenant, thank you for coming by. Oh! If it isn't T.J. Hooker. What's goin' on? We're raiding Isaiah's place. Is it a rip? No. - Foreclosure. No, I can't risk you getting seen. We've got everything. Frye came by my house tonight. - He invited us to a barbecue. Okay. Wine, it's always nice to bring some cheese. He came to my house. - I don't know. So, what's the problem? We were both home, me and Mel. We couldn't have created a cover for you as a different cop. Frye would've found it. We altered your real record. But this brings her in the case, now. Ty, I can't figure out that part of your life, for you. What does that mean? I doubt anything's going to happen in the barbecue. Some guests about seven. Two cooks, five shooters. But it doesn't look like Isaiah's there. Take these two, go in the back. We'll go through the front. I'm not going with these maniacs. Good, stay out of their way. 'Look, you're not in charge.' No collateral on this. This isn't a hit. Carter, we're not cops. - 'We'll do what we have to.' - Not for fun. We're in position. - Everybody down! - Get down, now! Get down, now! No-no-no, you stay right there! Cover! Cover! No! On the ground! On the ground, now! - 'Alright, let's go.' - Let's go. You know whose house this is? Terry Isaiah! Ah-h, at least we got the right address, huh? We're good. Okay. We're done. Oh, and, uh, you have a lovely house. You're dead. That's a fact. Isaiah's gonna kill you, kill your family, kill anyone you care about. That was fun. Yeah. I'm the only one who thinks last night was real. Sometimes we work with questionable people, you know? No. Carter seems like he's friend's with them. Doesn't that seem strange to you? Not really. They are who they are, you know? 'Not pretend to be something else' 'Kinda makes sense.' Another shot at me? What? Because of Scott and you. You have to stop thinking everything's about that, okay? 'Dean, I need you to back-up Ty.' - It's a barbecue. - I know. Just go, please. - Just some people I know. Dean says they stole money from Isaiah. We crippled a major drug operation. It's a bargain. You're early. What? I'm right on time. You used to like 'em skinny, Carter. What'd you just say? 'She's working with me'' Latest victim, huh? Hey, don't listen to this maniac. 'He's gonna get you killed.' Hey, got it? Yeah, some meth, X, some uppers. That other thing you were asking about? - There's a guy I know. Deals to all the clubs and bars. Usually buys from Isaiah. That's perfect, Mott. Thanks. - It's cool. As long as you get most of it back to me, next week. - 'Got a big buyer.' - 'No problem.' Everything else good? 'The kid?' Doing better. Thanks. Do you know any normal people? What do you mean? What are we doing with that? Huh. Going into business. I'm a little nervous. No need to be, baby, just be yourself. These guys are just cops, and you know what? I don't even know if they're bad cops. - I think I get it. Why you like this job. It's kind of exciting. Hey! Hey! You made it! - Thank you for the invite. - Not bad. - Hi, Mellisa. - Hi. - Good. Thank you. - Brought you some Chardonnay. - Chardonnay, beautiful. I'll go find some ice for this. - I'm good. - Good, good. - 'Melissa, my wife.' - 'Hey, nice to meet you.' - Hi. This is my wife, Theresa. - Hi. - Hi. 'And this..' This is my little boy, Evan. Oh, my God! How old is he? About 18 months. - Oh! - Heh-heh. High five! See He's so precious! Good looking, like his dad, huh? - Yeah, yeah. Ty decided to bring the Chardonnay instead of Chianti. - Funny. House, lawn, barbecues. I tried it once. Didn't stick. I need you with me. Jaimie, you back-up Ty. We'll take my car. Oh, my God. He's wonderful. What's going on with your custody case? Nothing good. Her mother hired some high-priced divorce lawyer. - Can't afford to fight that. - You know, I know a guy. 'Usually reps the Hollywood crowd' but I got him out of a DUI. 'He was with a stripper. He'd been bangin' on the side.' He'll take your case. - There you go! - Frye, man. - 'Thanks.' - No problem. - Yeah. His wife couldn't handle the hours he was pulling. Now she wants sole custody. Damn. ' - Five months. Yeah, I know, I'm a rookie. You? - Seventeen years. - 'Wow!' That's Jackie, there, the Blondie. I like working with married guys. Why is that? When you got something to come home to makes you think real hard about what you're doing out there. Married guys make better cops. At least that's what I think. Couldn't agree more. What are we talking about here? I'm talking about a partnership, man. I know you're wired into all the clubs. 'From what I hear you got a pretty tasty customer base.' I wanna tap into it. I got a regular supplier. And he does not like competition. Talking about Terry Isaiah? You've heard of him and you tryin' to cut into his business? You're either dumb or crazy. Isaiah's about to run out of product, bro. And why is that? Lab in Topanga got hit last night. Blasted up. Unless you start piling for the winter your customers' gonna need a new dealer. How do you know all this? Because we're the ones who did it. 'Check with Isaiah, man.' Oh, he's gonna tell you he's fresh out of product. 'Unlike us.' That's a freebie, man. 'You want to do business with us' call us. 'Alright?' I don't know anything about this. But even if I did, I don't care. I don't care. 'No!' No. It's not my problem, I told you that, last time. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, get everyone together. Just got a tip about a new supplier that maybe setting up. Police department. Put your hands up! - Put your hands up! What's happenin'? 'What is this?' Tumi. When the hell are you gonna get a job? Anybody got a warrant? Ow! I'm hearing you're buying from a new supplier. Is that true? Who's gonna pay for my door? Focus, Tumi. Maybe, I heard of a couple of white dudes. - Selling door to door. - Tumi, names. If I give you that, then you and me all good? What do I look like? Used car salesman? - Don't hustle me. - Then don't act like Supercop. I know Isaiah's pulling your strings. Probably how you heard about this, right here. I can't believe you could be this stupid. Toss it! The whole place! - Gun! - No! Hold your fire! He's dead. What are you doing? He had a gun. It was a remote. Looked-looked like a gun. Noyce. Wait a minute. 'Wait!' It's done. Call it in. To one less scumbag on earth, huh? DA's office call you yet? Spoke to shooting team rep. 'It all happened so fast.' You did the right thing. He waited until I turned my back then he drew his gun to kill me. But it wasn't a gun. I saw a gun. Plain as day. No question. 'Yep.' 'Tumi was a degenerate. Sold drugs to kids.' Nobody at the DA's office gonna lose any sleep over this. 'Just tell 'em what happened.' And you got four other decorated officers that'll swear under oath to it. You know, you're thinking too hard about it, man. 'You did the right thing.' Who is Isaiah? Tumi said someone named Isaiah was pulling your strings. - Damn, Ty. You don't miss a thing, do you? 'Isaiah, as in Terry Isaiah.' He's a big-time supplier. Meth, X. So, you do know him. Yeah, he's an informant of mine. So, you go after a dude like Tumi but you let a supplier like Isaiah operate? Isaiah feeds me information. He's more valuable to me on the streets than he is in jail. And as soon as that changes, well, we'll blow him out too. Why did Tumi say Isaiah was pulling your strings? You gotta give these fools their pride. I let 'em think they're calling the shots, for now. But when their judgement day comes they answer to us. And who do we answer to? Nobody. 'Ever'' You wanna be a legit cop? 'You wanna be a real, bona fide crime fighter.' This is what it takes. And don't ever hang your head down low. Where the hell have you been? I'd to get my head straight, something happened. I heard, you shot Tumi? What are you doing? I didn't put you there to kill people. It's a little different when the bad guys know you're a good guy. Did Tumi give up that we're the new suppliers? - I don't know, I'm not sure. - Not good enough! I need you to catch Frye working for Isaiah, you understand? What if you're wrong about them? I'm not. Frye said Isaiah was his informant. It makes sense. Are you falling for Frye's bullshit? What is it with you and him? Frye doesn't do any thing that we don't. - He's a cop. Just like us. - He's a cop. Just like us! He's nothing like us! - Alright! - Get that straight! 'It's always good to show your feelings. Vent a little bit' Come on, let's go. We're out of here. Hm. You've been drinking. Went out with Frye and the guys. Long day. You alright? Yeah. You have fun at the barbecue the other day? I must admit, I did. I mean, since you've been working for Carter we haven't exactly hung out with other cop families. So, it's nice to have something in common, you know? Yeah. Working with these guys, you see there's different ways of doing the job. Hmm, come here. Yo, Ty. You file your shooting report, yet? I was about to, why? If you got something to say, say it. Frye's trying to make it a dirty shooting, but it wasn't. I had a clear line of sight at Tumi. When Frye leaned down, he planted the gun. After you shot him, he leaned back down to check his pulse. Suddenly, the gun became a remote control. What the hell are you saying to me? It's what he does, man. He ropes you in. It's how he wins your loyalty. Did something like that to me. Always had my doubts. But by then, it's already on record. If you come out now, you end your career. What do you know about Terry Isaiah? Isaiah, what? Why are you asking? Frye said that Isaiah tipped him off to Tumi and these new drug suppliers, right? What I'm asking is, is Isaiah really Frye's informant? Huh, rumor is Isaiah has something on Frye. Way back when Frye sold his badge to Isaiah for a few deals. What Frye didn't know was that Isaiah recorded everything. Well, you can go to IAD? I'm no rat. So, why you telling me this? Your wife told my wife that you're trying to have a baby. Trust me, man. Everything changes after that. - Nothing, captain. He's trying to convince that sex life doesn't change after you have kids. I ain't convinced, Chavez. We traced a number we found at Tumi's. It sounds like that new supplier we've been hearing about. This guy's a real piece of work. Armed robbery, home invasions. We're hitting him now. - I'll just get my stuff. - No, right now. Where are we? Nothing from Ty. You know Frye, don't you? We worked together on a task force, years ago. 'It was a different time.' 'Different department.' We were encouraged to do questionable things. Frye was the worst. 'A straight up thug.' How is he still on the force? When things got out of hand, and the DA's indictments started coming down. Everyone stuck to the "honor among cops" code 'except Frye.' Everyone was sure he'd cut some kind of deal to save his own ass. What happened to you? Let's just say, I wasn't on the Chief's Christmas card list. So, Frye gets a wife, white picket fence, promotion. You get to be buddies with criminals. Not quite. Where's Dean? At home, why? Frye's on his way there, right now! Alright, let's be smart. Don't take any chances. Especially after Tumi's. No one's losing sleep should this scumbag meet his demise. Let's go. You stay here. Cover the front. Police department! What the hell happened? Crazy son of a bitch just started shooting. He got away. This is 2-Zebra-12, we've an officer down. Repeat, officer down! '1400 block of Lanterman Drive'' He's dead. Alright, he's a convicted drug dealer. Relatively new in town, so check with your contacts in the community. Work with your sister agencies. And I've been asked to pass on a message from the chief. He understands emotions are running high. But proper procedure is gonna make this case. The way I see it.. '...is they have their department's procedure.' 'And we have our code.' Chavez was our brother. That's why we need to bag this cop-killing scumbag, ourselves. In cuffs, if you have to. In a body bag, if you can. Did you see them shoot Chavez? I barely made it out of there. Chavez came to me, right before he was killed. Said he was thinking about leaving Frye's unit. - No. But Frye must have found out. He probably got spooked that Chavez was having second thoughts. He's trying to tie up loose ends, before promotion. First Tumi, now Chavez. So, maybe, I can make an approach, cut a deal with Frye. Fry's made you into a cop Every cop's gonna be gunning for you. They'll shoot you on plain sight and get a medal for it. 'Frye's played this perfectly.' Damn it! I have to clean this up with Maynard. Ty, why don't you go home and get some rest? No, I want Frye! But how, Ty? We don't even know what his end game is. The drugs in your apartment. 'Frye recovered 'em.' But when I checked, he never booked it in evidence. 'So, he still has them?' Can I talk to you? - Go ahead. - Well, Chavez, sir. Before the shooting, he told me he was having second thoughts. Second thoughts? He thought what you were doing was dirty. I think he was flirting with IAD. Why would he tell you that? Since I'm the new guy. Said he wanted me to know what I was getting into. Well.. ...what do you think you're getting into? A unit that gets results. I know Chavez was your boy, and what happened was a tragedy. But if you ask me, you got a lucky break. The unit's better off without him. I'm gonna...let you in on a little something. 'Word's come down from up high'' They're making me a captain. 'I'm gonna have my own division.' You, Noyce, Kim. 'We're gonna run it the old way.' The right way. I'm all for that, cap. There's uh.. ...one last thing we need to do. Deal with Terry Isaiah. You didn't do what I said, Frye. Are you getting deaf with age? 'Cause I said I want that punk-ass dead for blasting my lab. Every cop is hunting him down. He's as good as dead. That doesn't make me feel any better. What the hell's this? Ah, call it restitution. To hold you over. Until you get another lab set up and running. What the hell is going on? Carter. You always were a sneaky son of a bitch. It's over, Jay. You called the cops? On me? You murdered a cop. You mean...he murdered a cop. As far as the world knows he's a cop-killer. And you.. 'You're an L.A.P.D. cautionary tale.' Just a bunch of.. ...cops gone bad in the pocket of a drug dealer. If I kill all of you. The picture practically paints itself. Tell them to put their guns down. You first. Wait! I can fix this! - Wait! - I can't, Frye. I can fix it! Put it down. Don't think you're any better than me. 'Ty, back off.' You okay? Cell phone was off. Yeah. Must be the battery. Well, look, Mel wanted me to invite you to dinner. She thought you and I could use some hang-out time. I told her you probably had a big date. Big night lined up, but I told her I'd ask, anyway. You know me too well. So, I'll tell her, maybe next time. Yeah. Next time. Cool. Listen, for a minute there, Mel thought she was pregnant. 'When we got married I told he'' if we ever had a baby, then I'd stop going under with you. Well, you do what you need to do. Goodnight, man.
