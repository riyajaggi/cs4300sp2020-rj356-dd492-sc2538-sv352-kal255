 ACCORDING TO MY C.I., IT'LL BE OVER TONIGHT. 15 KILOS ARE COMING IN AROUND MIDNIGHT ON A FOOD-DELIVERY TRUCK. WELL, THAT WOULD SEEM RIGHT, 'CAUSE SMITHBURG SAID WE'RE CLOSING EARLY. YOU THINK THIS PIZZA DUDE'S REALLY INVOLVED? WELL, HE'S GOT KEYS TO THE PLACE, HE SHUTS IT DOWN WHENEVER HE WANTS -- NOT TO MENTION HIS TWO NARCO PRIORS -- SO, YEAH, I DO. IS HE CAPABLE OF MOVING THIS KIND OF WEIGHT? THAT, I DOUBT. SO HE'S A BAGMAN. OKAY, BUT FOR WHO? Alex: GOOD QUESTION. IF MY C.I.'s ON THE MONEY, WE'LL FIND OUT TONIGHT.
