 'Okay.' There we go. We were at liberty in Singapore. We went to this mall. Guess what it was called? "Four floors of whores." I'm not kiddin'. Top floor was top-shelf and the bottom floor.. ...was not that much, you know. Yeah, check your hoses and tires, Boot. - No breakdowns. - Okay. They're sweeping for transponders. That's no accident.

 Barely. He knows about four guys, none of them important. They're letting him drive a container of counterfeit ambien. Yeah, let's see if they let him drive it to their warehouse. That's what we need. Alright. Alright, the chippies are all over the 710 today. Don't do anything to piss them off. Right lane. 55. Okay. Where to? 5212 Rosecrans, Gardena, Cal- Wait. This is a Costco. Leave the truck, keys under the mat southeast corner of the parking lot. - Someone will pick it. I don't even know, and it doesn't matter. Just do it. Okay.

 Hey, wait, wait, wait, Ronny-Boy. - Call your mom. - Yo. - 'Yo.' 'I'll leave the load in the parking lot, okay?' Alright. Guess it's up to me. - 'Yep, I'm good.' Try to park in the shade, though, okay? - I'll do my best. Get comfy. - Yeah, alright. Hey! Stop! What's up? The seal on the container. That thing looks funky. I'm telling you, I was here when they loaded the can. It weighed. I want you to wind the engine, make some noise. What If I have to start shooting, I don't want anyone to hear it. Heh-heh, I'm sorry! My foot slipped! 'You know, all the revving!' Just go. And try not to crash! 'See you later, Ronny-Boy!' So, California's deficit just grew by $86.70. Taxpayers are paying for my cab fare. They're not letting me near the warehouse, Carter like I told you they wouldn't. What's going on - Yeah. He's hanging around the port, checking if there's more. 'Really?' Not like him to go fishing. What can I say? He loves his job. Why don't we stake that truck, follow 'em when they move it? No, they wait for days, make sure nobody's watching. It's one of this guy's keys to success. 'What "guy"?' This guy, Sanchez, he's a ghost. Runs his whole business from afar. Can't find him. That hasn't stopped him from putting together the biggest smuggling ring on the west coast. Drugs, guns, counterfeits.. ...and it all goes through a warehouse somewhere. What about following the stuff he's shipping out? I don't know, maybe. My guys, they only know what they do. They don't even know who to talk to. - Compartmentalized. Smart. - Yeah. I'm telling you, we need someone who's worked with him before. Like William Cline. 'Who's William Cline?' What do you know about Billy? When Sanchez was starting out, Billy ran some loads for him. That it? You two got arrested for possession and disturbing peace at 603 Catherine Street. Must have been one hell of a party. It was. In 2004, him and a buddy, the shooter, Matt Parker, got busted for being part of a drug deal that turned into a murder. Parker went away for 20 years. Billy did four, change in Chino. Billy's out? About a year. Great. Jaimie, I need you to go to him. I need you to be Jaimie Anderson again. Get Billy to introduce me to Sanchez. - No. No way. I have done a lot to leave that behind. And after this is all over, you still can. All we need Billy for is an intro to Sanchez then he's out of your life. Maybe not. Billy's had a lot of time to think. About what? Jaimie, about what? I wasn't even there. I was in the car. I told them not to bring the gun. It was stupid. What are you talking about? I got caught because it was my car. Traffic camera. Police said I'd do about 5 years minimum. I was 23 years old. So you flipped on them. I told the cops where the gun was. And you walked. D.A. concocted some story about me doing my prison time in Yuma, but I never did it. What if Billy knows that I'm the one that turned him in? Then you lie to him. Oh. Oh, wow. - Thank you. Mmm. - Mmm. I have to get going. I have to go to San Diego for a case. Undercover cops on a road trip. Play the alphabet game, sing to the radio.. ...have a picnic. What's the case? Why out of town? Oh, come on, come on. I'm not gonna say anything. Come on, you can tell me. I can keep a secret. Smuggling. There's a guy down there who might be a contact. See? It wasn't so bad. Your boss, he makes you.. ...overly secretive. He's kind of paranoid. You may have to make yourself scarce awhile, till it's over. - Not long. Just a few days, I hope. Okay. Well, maybe I'll finally get some work done. What? Nothing. Just where do you think you're going with that stuff? No way. No friggin' way. Oh, my God! How are you? - I'm fine. - My God! Oh, I never thought I was gonna see you again. - Here I am. - Here you are. - It's a long story. Always is with you. How'd you find me? I called your mom. I'm in L.A. now, so I drove down. You went to all that trouble just to find me. Yep. - Good. I pour drinks for losers, and I steal meat from my boss. I can't believe it. I never thought I was gonna see you again. Come on. Let's get a drink. I'm guessing this isn't just social. - Come on. It's me. I got a friend...wants to move some stuff south of the border. You used to work for a guy named Sanchez He still in business? That's why you're here? To meet Sanchez? You got some set of balls. Which is amazing on a chick as hot as you. - Sanchez is tough to meet. - That's why I came to you. I'm glad you did. So I was totally into phones when I got out. A lot changed. - It's like "Star Trek." - Yeah. - Ah, 14 months. Good behavior. Once again, the pretty girls always get cut deals. I always felt bad for you. You shouldn't have gone to jail. You either. So, you need Sanchez. Uh, my friend, actually. Carter Sherman. Oh, sounds like the Country Club crowd. - 'Makes sense.' Means you never waste time with small fish. You're always looking to trade up. That's not true. Well, you traded up on me with Matt. - Billy, we were just friends. - Yeah. So, I make the introduction to Sanchez. I assume there's something in it for my trouble? Uh, couple grand. Look...here's the thing. I'm in a little bit of a jam right now, cash-wise. - No, no. I'm clean. I mean, no hard stuff. I got this other thing. I got a call from a loan shark. I got to get this guy's cash, like, yesterday. And if you don't, they'll break your kneecaps. Break 'em, snap 'em, grind 'em up into a fine powder and snort my kneecaps. It's gonna be bad. What? Let's do a betsy. - No! - I got the perfect guy. I'm paying you two grand. I owe $10,000, $11,000. And they want it now. Look, this guy who comes into the restaurant, he'd be perfect. - You can do it in your sleep. - I don't know. What, are you too good for that now No. It is not my favorite play. What about your buddy who wants the guns? Maybe he can help me. 'Cause if you want me to go to L.A. and make intro to Sanchez I need to get that money now. He's gonna pay his loan shark. That money's gone. Maynard's not just gonna give us 11 grand. - Don't worry about it. - You guys take a walk. I'll get him his money. We'll get the introduction to Sanchez. Everybody will be happy. Hey, who's this guy to her? - Old friend. I don't know. Alright. Should we keep an eye on her? No. You know, she's got some shady friends in her past, Carter. I know. We're lucky. Call Ty. See if he's got anything in L.A. in case this thing goes sideways. So, I figured, "What the hell?" and I jumped into the fountain. - Betsy, you're nuts. Why not? We're not gonna live forever. - I am. I juice. - You are so funny. I'm glad somebody thinks so. Hey, babe. Why don't you get us a couple drinks? Carter, this is Billy. Billy, this is Carter. So, Jaimie said she helped you out of a little...money bind. You don't mind, do you? I mean, she said you wouldn't mind. Depends on what she did. Just gets a guy in a compromising position. She's pretty well clothed, mind you. He's not. I take a picture. The guy's married. Doesn't want the wife to know he's cheating. Take a walk to the bank. Candy from a baby. - She's a good girl. - Yeah. - So now you're free and clear. - Yeah. What about Sanchez? Put a call in. I don't think it's gonna be a problem. That's what I want to hear. How you doin'? Awesome. - We met at Harvard. - Don't worry about it. - Just making sure you're okay. I thought we were supposed to be all professional. Yeah, we are. It's professional to make sure you're okay. Well.. I'm okay. 'Here's your MGD 64.' You're supposed to be Carter's muscle. Don't stand so close. So, you and Jaimie been dating for a few months now, huh? Why? Something you want to tell me about her? Let's go change the music. Okay. What did you ask him? He was just making conversation. Conversation? I don't need you digging in my life, judging me. I'm doing all of this so you can get your guy. I'm not judging you. That's yourjob. What the hell's that supposed to mean? What do you think I did today? It doesn't matter what I think. Then why even bring it up? Obviously, you thought the worst. Maybe you're projecting. Shut up. No more questions about me. Frank. Yep. Alright. It's on, bitches. We go to L.A. - Basically. - Frank is his number two. - I want to meet the number one. Of course. Who wouldn't? Sanchez is big-time now. Plus, I hear, he doesn't make any personal appearances now. Yeah. Look, when we first meet him, just be cool. Don't wig out. What do you mean,"be cool?" I'm cool. - Billy. - Frank. Long time no meow. You're out, huh? Yeah. I've been meaning to come around. Yeah. I can understand why you didn't. - They're with me. That's a problem for you two 'cause I've always wanted to shoot this prick. I was robbed. How many friggin' times I got to say that? Doesn't matter if I don't believe you, does it? Now, Sanchez kicked my ass for losing that load, Billy. - I'll talk to him. - Yeah, tell him about prison. We gonna fight about something that happened six years ago? Look, I'm here to make it up. I brought you a little business. Mr. Sherman would like to move something to Mexico. Tell him to call UPS. He's willing to pay special delivery rates. Abso-friggin-lutely. Guns. 'Large caliber.' 'Type favored by the Mexican Cartels.' 'Where'd you get them?' Impounded by the cops, but way too nice to be melted. You're ripping off the cops? Yeah. Brings heat. Not interested. I got a guy on the inside. No heat. Frank, as long as the cops are taking guns this is a repeat-customer gold mine. Shut it. Okay? Maybe, I'll help. First, I got to see 'em. Well, with my old guy, I just paid the freight. - He's out of business. Exactly. Okay? He's not as good as us. Sanchez has rules. - I got to see it first. - Okay. Okay. I'm on it. - I'll call you when I-- - No, no, no. I call him. - It's my load. - I don't know you from Adam. Okay? Him, I know. I want him there. If anything goes wrong, I want to know who to shoot first. 'And you, how long you know them?' I've known her 10 years. If it makes you more comfortable I'll go check out her situation now. That's better. And you go get the guns so I can check them. Okay. Here you go. You moving on up. Trying to. - Yeah. I just told Frank I'd check you out just to calm him down. So, it looks like Carter doesn't stay here. You know, I'm gonna get us some beers so we can sit by the pool. Mm-hmm. Hey, Jaimie? You in a lawsuit? No. So, who is Scott Mueller? None of your business, serpico. - Naughty girl. - Oh, God. You got a little slice on the side. There is no "side." Carter and I are not serious. Clearly. I'm glad. I know, he's kind of a tool. That's not what I mean. What did you mean? All this time we've known each other, we never really.. ...hooked up. I thought about you a lot in prison. That was a terrible pick-up line, Billy. - Uh, no. Okay. If I was available, it would be totally different. And you're not available? Scott. The lawyer? Yeah. I-I like him. - No. Because I like him. Wow. That's new for the ice princess. - He doesn't know. Yeah. I bet there's all kinds of things he doesn't know, huh? I'm trying to be better. I have made mistakes, big ones, but.. Hey, Frank. Yeah. I checked her out. She's still the same chick. Okay. He wants to see the guns at my place. Let's go. Go get some towels. I don't want to grease the bed. Always looking out for me. - Maynard. - Umph. Here you go. Frank.. ...plus one. This is it? I thought you had a big stash. I'm not gonna haul 250 firearms to a motel. 'I got 15 machine guns, 30 assault rifles' a dozen dragunovs, 150 handguns, give or take - and 6 browning 1919s. - 'Mm-hmm.' Ain't that a little honey? Pack 'em in four-by crates like appliances. Can you get these to Manzanillo by friday? You get 'em boxed up, they can go out tomorrow. So, I'm guessing this is gonna be about 30 grand. ' - Yeah. - We weigh them. - Well, I'll pay after you do. Is Mr. Sanchez aware of this deal? Does it matter? Yeah. I never heard of you until yesterday. This is an important deal for me and my customers. 'I'd like to meet him.' I'd like to see him, too. Say hello. It's been awhile. It's gonna be a while. I'll call him with instructions where to leave the guns. Excuse me. - Looks like we did it. - Yeah. Anytime you guys want to throw in a "Thank you, Billy" I think that might be customary. And will my finder's fee be applicable to future deals? I think it's "customary" for something like this to be a one-shot deal, Billy. Billy, you should head back to San Diego when this is all done. Bye, Billy. "Bye, Billy." It's gonna be a late night here, babe. I may not make it home. I can't just bail. Okay. I gotta go. Alright. Bye. Carter said pack these crates for Sanchez and go home. - You don't have to work late. - Save the police work, buddy. Get the lid. Howdy. Hey. "Come on in, Billy." Sure, of course. Cute robe. - Scott's coming over soon. Assistant district attorney. That's a little bit more than a lawyer you're banging, right? - Yeah. - You left that part out. Is it all part of the new leaf you're turning over? Dating Mr. Law and Order? Go ahead. Make fun of me. But seriously, you ever got in trouble there's gotta be an ace in the hole. - Fix a lot of problems. - Right. - My old friend, Rupert. Rupert got busted in downtown L.A. with 20 little baggies. They got him on intent to distribute. Scott could plead him out. That's what ADA's do. Rup and I could still be in business. I don't feel comfortable. You know, it's not always comfortable helping people out. You know what was really uncomfortable? - Prison. - Yeah, I know. I did 14 months, remember? In Yuma. Yeah. Aracelli came and saw me.. '...after she went and saw you in Yuma.' She went and saw you 6 months into a 14-month sentence. Except you weren't there. First, I figured you just got transferred out, but.. '...now I know you were never there.' - Billy-- - Stop it. I know you never went away, so don't insult me by lying to me. - I had a reason. - You didn't want to do time. I was your friend, and you sold me out to the cops to save your own ass. I couldn't go to jail. I thought I was pregnant. You're full of it. I did five years, Jaimie, five years because of you. And you're gonna make it up to me starting now. I'm telling you the truth. Shut up, okay? Just shut up, okay? You get Rupert his plea deal or I'm not answering my phone when Hughes calls about your gun shipment. I can't force him to get someone a plea deal! I suggest you find a way. Otherwise, I find your ADA boyfriend and I tell him what kind of a worthless person you really are. A lying, conniving piece of crap. That is what you are, Jaimie. - You're here late. - Yup. I'm looking for Carter. He's not answering his phone. Upstairs. 'Thinking.' Okay. You okay? Why so concerned with me lately? Okay, forget it. - Yeah. You've never been nice to me. I've had a lot of that from men and I'm not interested anymore. - I'm trying to be nice to you. - It's inconsistent. That's confusing. Deliberately so, I'm sure. - Look-- - I have a problem with Scott. - No. It's pretty clear. No plea deal for Billy's friend, no Sanchez. I don't want to involve Scott. I don't want to lie. Any channels I go through will raise a lot of red flags. - So I have no choice. - There's always a choice. If you give Billy what he wants we get our bust, and it's over. And it seems to me the sooner Billy's out of your life.. ...the better. Thanks for breaking the rules and inviting me over. - I have a favor to ask. - Oh, no, baby. You're doing it wrong. You should've asked before the sex. - I'm serious. - Okay. What? There's this guy, Rupert Crawford.. ...he got busted a few days ago. He's my C.I. and I need him on the street for this case. Okay. Well, if he's not out, we could lose the bust and this could be big for me. So, I was wondering.. ...if you could get him a plea deal? - Intent to sell. - Yes. Yeah, okay. That's gonna be tricky. Are you-you're sure that you need this guy out? Yes. Okay. - I'll do what I can. - Wait a second. I love you. Whoa. What, you okay? What, I can't say, "I love you"? No, please. It's nice. I mean, it's unusual, but nice. I love you, too. Whoa, you slept here? Yeah. Trouble at, uh, home? Mel wants a baby. Well, I mean, look.. You had to anticipate having kids. 'That's what happens.' You are married. Melissa and I made a deal. Said if we ever had kids, I would give this up. 'No more undercover work for me.' Did you shake on it? I talked to Rupert's lawyer. He's not your C.I., Jaimie. Who's Billy? - No. Rupert told his lawyer, Billy set this up. Okay, what is going on? It's hard to explain. I think-- Look, Jaimie, this got flagged by my bureau chief, okay? He's asking me questions, and I cannot give him answers because I can't tell him that my girlfriend - It's my fault. Is this Billy? Lieutenant Carter Shaw. Oh, please. Please, come in. Jaimie called and mentioned that you had a problem with the plea deal. I asked Jaimie to do this. I thought, an ADA doing his girlfriend cop a favor springing a confidential informant, well.. ...it must happen every day, right? So, is this guy connected to your case or not? - My boss is gonna need to know. - He's connected to me. We're working on a big case and Rupert is our in. We need Rupert on the street. He's not a C.I. He's just a scumbag, along with his friend Billy. I'm sorry for not being honest with you. Yeah, uh, okay. If there's any way you can do this, any way at all it will enable us to bring down a major smuggling operation. - I'll see what I can do. - And I hate to ask.. ...but it needs to happen today. Wow. Uh...okay. I'm sorry to get Jaimie entangled in all this. - 'I really am.' - No, no. I think it's fine. She's just trying to do her job. So I guess he's just a chump to you? 'My boyfriend.' He's a means to an end. How else are we supposed to get Sanchez? He wants to help me and you just manipulate him. I was covering for you. I thought that's what you wanted. No. That's what you wanted. Sanchez, that warehouse. It's too much. I'm gonna tell Scott not to do it. How am I supposed to know what is and isn't okay with you? Scott is not gonna get into trouble. Your secret is safe. It shouldn't be this easy. Lying to someone you care about? Jaimie, does he even know your real name? Screw you, Carter. - I'm not your problem. - No, you're not. That's why I'm gonna tell Scott the truth about me. 'Everything...right now.' Hey. I need to talk to you. I need to explain what happened. It's done. - The plea deal. I just heard. I was gonna call you, but, uh.. It wasn't easy, but I pushed it through. That's, uh.. Thanks. I need to tell you why I lied. Yeah, let's not get into that right now. I mean, actually, I can't. I have to get back to court. I mean, you lied. I can't say that I liked it. I mean, I wouldn't lie to you, but, um...I wouldn't. But I've been around these cases long enough to know that whatever you guys are into is complicated. Yeah. - I'm-- - I forgive you. I know you can't say you're sorry, 'cause you're a woman. That's a joke. Hey, lighten up, Allen. Look, you know what? Next time, just say, "Scott, I need you to do this for me but I can't tell you why", okay? Just be honest with me. Otherwise.. I'm gonna start to wonder, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Alright. I'll see you later. Okay. Go make your bust. Okay, Billy. Yeah, I'm on it. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm gonna drive it there myself. Alright, good. Bye. Bang. Deal's goin' down, huh? - Yeah. - You seem a little surprised. What's going on? Is Jaimie handling it okay? - She's good. Here's the address where they want me to leave the truck. Carter, we can't follow it to the warehouse. No, but if it never leaves the lot I can raise holy hell, demand to drive it there myself. Okay. Wait a minute. What about the driver? Yeah. Bring a car with a big trunk. And make sure he doesn't have a friend watching you. You still here? Go! It's almost over. When the bust goes down, I'll be arrested. You and Billy escape with the LAPD and Sanchez hunting him he'll want to get out of town. Things will go back to normal. What's normal to you, Carter? Let's go. Hands. - Yeah. You're under arrest. Anybody watching? If you're lying to me, and this truck stays here for three weeks you're spending that time in my trunk. Anybody watching? - I'm not sure. - Get out of the truck. Get out! - 'No, we're good.' Look, I caught this guy sneaking up on you. But I nabbed him, didn't I? Hey. How you doin'? Feet together. Comfy? Talk amongst yourselves. Whoo! You know what? I'm not ready to have kids yet. Nope. I just checked, and my truck is still there, Billy. Call him. Look, sometimes it takes a little longer. He said my stuff was going out today. - 'Call him!' - You call him. Call him! Hey, it's Billy. Yeah, so I guess the package is still there? Uh-huh. You know where the driver is? I know where my truck is. Right where I left it. 'It has to go out today! Do you understand that?' Give me the address, and I'll drop it off myself. The people expecting the package do not like to be disappointed. Yeah, and I'd like to wake up alive tomorrow. Yeah, I'm sure you would, too. Just give me the address. You know, you guys aren't great on customer service. - We don't have to be. - 'I'd like to meet him.' - No. Damn, I wanted to say hello. - He's not around. - He's never around. What, did you kill him? No way. No, I didn't kill him. He had a heart attack three years ago. What, you didn't tell anybody? No. Business is good, man. Why rock the boat? So you run this whole operation? Yeah, I do. Congrats. Nice business you got here. Yeah. Nobody move! Nobody move! Keep your hands where I can see 'em. Don't move. Nobody move. Son of a bitch. - No! - Oh! - Billy, you son of a bitch! - 'Stay down, stay down.' Where you going?! We got about 20 seconds till LAPD shows up. - I know. I know. - 'God!' How did you and Carter not know that guy was a cop? How was I supposed to know? You didn't! You have any money? Anything valuable? I'm taking these. I'll set up somewhere, and get them back. - You need to give me some cash. - No. No? Look, I am on probation, and those cops know who I am. I saved your life. After you almost got me arrested and put me in jail again? I'll set up somewhere, then I'll come back for you. - You should stay away! - You owe me! No, I don't. - I'm a cop, Billy. - Oh! - I used you to make that bust. You're a criminal. Not anymore. If you ever come near me again, or anyone I love I will kill you. I will put a gun in your hand and I will claim that I didn't have a choice. I'm a cop. You're a low-life. They will believe me. You wouldn't do that. Yeah, I would. Get out of here. Don't ever let me see you again. Leave the necklaces. Really? Yeah. Did Billy buy it? Does he think you guys are on the lam? He won't be coming around anytime soon. Oh. I know better than to ask if you're alright. Yeah. Sorry. I got.. I wanted to tell Scott the truth about myself.. ...and then I didn't. - I don't think I can take it. You, um.. You really care about him? Yeah. Dump him.
