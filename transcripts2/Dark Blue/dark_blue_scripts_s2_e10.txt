 OH. COME ON, BABY. IMAGINE ME WEARING THIS... AND NOTHING ELSE. MMM. COME HERE. LISTEN, I KNOW A FEW PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN YOUR PIPELINE, TOO. COULD BE BIG MONEY. WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU? FINDER'S FEE. OFF THEIR END, NOT YOURS. Danny: WHAT DO YOU SAY, MOM? NO CARTELS, NO GANGS. DONE. NOW... I GOT YOU A LITTLE PRESENT. HANDCRAFTED IN ITALY. WOW! THAT IS BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. DON'T BE A LITTLE BITCH, NICK. COME ON, FELLAS. IF I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA CAUSE TENSION, I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN YOU ONE, TOO, NICK. NOW, HOW ABOUT A LITTLE HELP WITH THE REST OF MY LOAD? NEXT TIME, I SHOOT YOU WITH IT. YOU UNDERSTAND ME? YEAH. I'll get you one. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, BABY. Carter: SEE YOU SOON. Jaimie: BYE. WELL, THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT SHARING, ARE THEY? EVER SINCE THEY WERE LITTLE. THEY FOUGHT OVER EVERY TOY. ONLY WAY I COULD GET THEM TO PLAY NICE WAS TO GET RID OF THE TOY. SO, THIS FAMILY YOU'RE IN WITH -- THE PERRYS. THEY'RE OPEN TO MORE BUSINESS? WE'VE MOVED TWO SHIPMENTS OF DOPE THROUGH THEIR SMUGGLING PIPELINE. I TOLD THEM WE HAVE FRIENDS INTERESTED IN DOING THE SAME. GOOD. THEN MEET YOUR NEW FRIEND. AHMAD SATAR. AN AFGHANI NATIONAL. WE'VE BEEN MONITORING HIM FROM WASHINGTON FOR A WHILE NOW. DEALS IN SECONDHAND EXOTIC CARS. HE'S ALSO A LEADING DISTRIBUTOR OF HEROIN ON THE WEST COAST. THIS GUY'S GONNA SMUGGLE IN A DIRTY BOMB? I'VE BEEN SEEING THIS A LOT LATELY -- TERRORIST GROUPS OVERSEAS APPROACHING DRUG DEALERS TO SMUGGLE IN DIRTY-BOMB COMPONENTS. IT MAKES SENSE. DRUG DEALERS HAVE THE BEST METHODS. WELL, SO FAR, NO ONE'S EVER PULLED IT OFF. SATAR WAS MOVING HIS "H" THROUGH THE CARS HE WAS IMPORTING FROM GERMANY, BUT GERMAN OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN CRACKING DOWN. SO WE'LL GET IN WITH SATAR AND INTRODUCE HIM TO THE PERRYS. HOW REAL IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIRTY BOMB? INTEL'S CREDIBLE. FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING, HE'S GONNA WANT TO MOVE A BIG WEIGHT OF "H." IN THE DOPE WILL BE COMPONENTS FOR A DIRTY BOMB. I HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH THE DIRECTOR. I'LL LET HIM KNOW YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD. SCARY STUFF. SPEAKING OF WHICH, ARE WE STILL ON FOR DINNER TONIGHT? SURE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "SPEAKING OF WHICH"? SORRY I'M LATE. I WAS STUCK ON THE PHONE WITH WASHINGTON. OH, THIS IS NICE. BREAK IN THE CASE? NOT EXACTLY. THERE'S A SUPERVISOR POSITION OPENING UP. I'M ON THE SHORT LIST. HERE? NO. MIAMI. I'D BE SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF THE FIELD OFFICE. OH, GREAT. WHEN DO YOU FIND OUT? I THINK IT DEPENDS ON HOW I DO WITH THIS CASE. THEY SAID THAT? WELL, WITHOUT SAYING IT. DO YOU WANT IT? IT'D BE A BIG PROMOTION. NOT WHAT I ASKED. I DO. THEN WE'D BETTER MAKE THIS CASE. THE PLAN IS SIMPLE -- WE GET IN WITH SATAR, HOOK HIM UP WITH THE PERRYS TO USE THEIR PIPELINE. SATAR WILL WANT TO SMUGGLE IN A MAJOR LOAD OF HEROIN. WITHIN THAT LOAD WILL BE A DIRTY BOMB. ICE ALREADY HAS A MAN UNDER AS A CONTACT TO SATAR WHO CAN MAKE THE INTRODUCTION. TY, YOU'RE WITH ME. HOW'S YOUR COVER WITH NICK? WE STILL GOT THE IDENTITY-THEFT THING. WE'RE TIGHT. THEN YOU AND JAIMIE SIT ON THE PERRYS. I CAN DO THAT ALONE. WHAT? I'M JUST SAYING MAYBE YOU'RE BETTER USED SOMEWHERE ELSE. YOU CAN'T COVER EVERYTHING ALONE. I'M IN WITH DANNY'S WIFE, AND SHE LIKES TO TALK. WORK THEM TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET A RIDE BACK WITH SHARON. YOU HOOKING UP WITH NICK? ALL RIGHT, WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU? WHAT? FIRST, YOU TRY DITCHING ME, AND NOW YOU'RE GIVING ME THE SILENT TREATMENT. THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT, IS IT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, JAIMIE. COME ON, DEAN. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A DATE. IT WASN'T A DATE. WE BOTH KNOW IT WAS A DATE. IT WASN'T A DATE. YOU WERE WEARING YOUR LITTLE BLAZER, YOU BOUGHT A BOTTLE OF WINE. THIS IS ALL IN YOUR HEAD. YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR YOUR SPA DATE. GO. YOU LOOK GREAT. Kevin: I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT I AM RUNNING SUPPORT ON MY OWN INVESTIGATION. BUT I DON'T BLAME YOU LOCALS. THAT BEING SAID, YOU HAVE 110% OF MY SUPPORT. THANKS FOR CLEARING THAT UP. NOW, WHAT'S THE CONNECT WITH SATAR? I HAVE BEEN WORKING SATAR FOR THREE MONTHS NOW. HE THINKS I'M A MAJOR PLAYER IN L.A. I'VE BEEN FEEDING HIM BITS OF INFO, MAKING HOOK-UPS. HE TRUSTS AND RESPECTS ME. YOU TEE HIM UP FOR THIS MEET? ROGER THAT. HE SAID HE'S LOOKING FOR A NEW PIPELINE FOR HIS PRODUCT. I TOLD HIM THAT YOU'RE THE MAN WITH THE PLAN. SO WE SHOULD PUT A WIRE ON YOU, CARTER. I GOT YOU COVERED, MY MAN. YOU'RE RUNNING WITH THE BIG DOGS NOW. LET'S GO. HEY, LOVER. HELLO, KEVIN. IS YOUR BOSS AROUND? LEAVE THE GIRL ALONE, KEVIN. MR. SATAR, THIS IS THE GUY THAT I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT. CARTER McGOWEN. PLEASURE. GOOD TO MEET YOU. THIS GUY MIGHT BE THE ANSWER -- YOU MAY GO NOW, KEVIN. UH, YOU DON'T NEED ME TO -- NO. THANK YOU. THIS WAY, PLEASE. HE BELIEVES HIMSELF OF ELEVATED IMPORTANCE. YEAH. I PICKED UP ON THAT. LANA, COULD YOU GET US SOME TEA, PLEASE? SURE. Satar: THANKS. KEVIN TELLS ME THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A NEED FOR A SHIPPING COMPANY, ONE THAT CAN CUT THROUGH THE BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE. TIME IS MONEY IN MY BUSINESS. MINE TOO. BUT THE COMPANY I WORK FOR HAS A SELECT CLIENTELE. PROPER INTRODUCTIONS ARE REQUIRED. SO IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS? NO, BUT I'VE WORKED WITH THEM CLOSELY. AND WHAT'S YOUR INTEREST? SOME KIND OF FEE? LIKE YOU SAID... TIME IS MONEY. I SPEND THREE MONTHS BUILDING A COVER, AND WHERE AM I? I'M OUT IN THE CAR. WRITE A MEMO. YOU SAID WE HAD EARS ON THIS. "EARS"? A WIRE. HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HEAR WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT? THIS IS AGENT KEVIN PHILLIPS. COULD YOU PATCH ME INTO AHMAD SATAR'S CELLPHONE? SATAR: Can you be a bit more specific about how it works? CARTER: I'm sorry, but that's for paying customers only. But it's a good system. NOT EVEN THE MEXICAN MANUFACTURERS HAVE THOUGHT OF IT. LET ME THINK ABOUT IT. PLEASE DO. I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD. GIVE ME A CALL IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. Thank you. HOW'D YOU DO THAT? WIRE ROOM IS TAPPED INTO SATAR'S CELLPHONE. WE CAN ACTIVATE IT WITHOUT SATAR KNOWING AND USE THE CELLPHONE MICROPHONE AS A BUG. SLICK. HOMELAND SECURITY, BRO. WE GOT JAMES BOND TECH AND THE PATRIOT ACT. WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED? Sharon: YOU TOTALLY SHOULD HAVE DONE IT! I DON'T KNOW. WHAT'S IT CALLED AGAIN A VAJAZZLE. I AM TELLING YOU. YOU CANNOT JUST GET A BRAZILIAN ANYMORE. IT LOOKS BORING. SO, WHAT, THEY STICK JEWELS AROUND IT? SWAROVSKI CRYSTALS. I DON'T GET IT. OH, HONEY, YOU WOULD, I'M TELLING YOU, IF YOU SAW THE LOOK ON A MAN'S FACE AFTER PULLING DOWN YOUR G-STRING. HE'S YOURS -- HOOK, LINE, AND BLACK AMEX CARD. SO I GUESS DANNY'S IN FOR A REAL TREAT TONIGHT, HUH? OH, I SAID A MAN, BUT I DIDN'T SAY WHICH MAN. YOU ARE SO BAD. WHAT? AAH! GET DOWN! I ALMOST DIED! NO, THEY TRIED TO KILL ME! YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO KILL YOUR HUSBAND. AND IT COULD BE THEY WERE FOLLOWING DANNY'S CAR, NOT KNOWING YOU HAD IT. YEAH, I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING. YOU ALL RIGHT, JAIMIE? YEAH. YOU TELL THE COPS ANYTHING? THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL. I DIDN'T EVEN GET A PLATE. OKAY, YOU TWO, BRING THE GIRLS HOME AND GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE -- I WANT ALL HANDS ON DECK. FOR WHAT? FOR WHAT? WE'RE GONNA FIND WHO DID THIS AND GET PAYBACK. THAT'S FOR WHAT. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, YOU'RE OVERREACTING, OKAY? I'M OVERREACTING?! WASN'T YOUR WIFE THAT ALMOST GOT KILLED, WAS IT, NICK GO! YOU OKAY? YEAH. HEY, W-WHAT'S A LITTLE AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE? YOU GET A LOOK AT THE SHOOTER? NO, IT HAPPENED TOO FAST. AND YOU THINK THIS WAS A HIT ON DANNY? YEAH, IT'S POSSIBLE. THESE GUYS HAVE ENEMIES. DANNY'S ON A WITCH HUNT. I MEAN, MAYBE HE WANTS REVENGE. STAY CLOSE TO THE PERRYS. SEE IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHO ORDERED THE HIT BEFORE DANNY AND NICK KILL SOMEONE. CHECK IN WITH SATAR? YEAH, HE'S PASSING ON YOUR PIPELINE DEAL, LIEUTENANT. WHY? HE DIDN'T GET INTO SPECIFICS. I GOT A FEELING HE FOUND SOMEONE ELSE. AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW HE HAD SOMEONE ELSE IN THE WORKS? IT WASN'T HIS FAULT, CARTER. WE'RE NOT POINTING FINGERS. WE'RE JUST BARELY OUT OF THE GATE, AND WE'RE ALREADY DEAD IN THE WATER. DON'T KISS OFF MIAMI JUST YET. YOU TWO GET ON SATAR. FOLLOW HIM 24/7. IF HE'S TALKING TO SOMEONE ELSE, I WANT TO KNOW WHO. THANKS FOR WHAT YOU SAID TO YOUR BOSS. THE LIEUTENANT GETS GROUCHY. HE DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING BY IT. EVEN SO, I OWE YOU ONE. HELLO? WHO THE HELL IS THIS? I'LL SIGN THE PAPERS WHEN I'M GOOD AND DAMN READY. IF SHE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT, HAVE HER CALL ME, NOT HER LAWYER. GOODBYE! LET ME GUESS -- DIVORCE. AIN'T NO SHAME. BEEN THERE. I'M PRESENTLY WORKING ON EX-MRS. PHILLIPS NUMBER TWO. MY WIFE, MELISSA, WANTS A DIVORCE, NOT ME. IS THERE ANOTHER GUY? SHE'S SEEING SOME DUDE SHE WORKS WITH -- CHRIS. "CHRIS." I FEEL YOU, TY. MY WIFE STARTED SEEING A GUY BARELY A MONTH AFTER SHE CAUGHT ME CHEATING ON HER. WHAT A WHORE, RIGHT? THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT MELISSA. SO, DO YOU WANT HER BACK? I DON'T WANT TO LOSE HER, KEVIN, OKAY? SATAR. SO, HAVE THE POLICE GOTTEN BACK TO YOU WITH ANYTHING YET? DO DANNY OR NICK HAVE ANY IDEA WHO IT MIGHT BE? DO YOU BELIEVE IN KARMA? UM, NO. NOT REALLY. NEITHER DID I. UNTIL YESTERDAY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, LET'S FACE IT -- OKAY, I HAVE LIVED MY WHOLE LIFE SELFISHLY, RIGHT? OH. AND I THINK THE SHOOTING WAS -- I DON'T KNOW -- GOD I MEAN, SOMETHING. SOMETHING SAYING THAT THIS -- "THIS IS PAYBACK FOR ALL THE PAIN THAT YOU'VE CAUSED." IT COULD ALSO BE BECAUSE YOUR HUSBAND'S A CRIMINAL. I HAVE JUST HAD A COSMIC WAKE-UP CALL. A WHAT? A COSMIC WAKE-UP CALL! TO DO WHAT? TO -- COME ON, COME ON. TO STOP ALL THE HURT THAT I HAVE CAUSED. LOOK, I HAVE TO CONFESS MY SINS, OKAY? OHH. I HAVE BEEN CHEATING ON DANNY WITH HIS OWN BROTHER, WITH NICK, AND I HAVE TO TELL HIM. NO, WAIT, OH -- YOU -- AND THEN I HAVE TO TELL NICK THAT I'VE BEEN CHEATING ON HIM WITH HIS BEST FRIEND, JAY. SHARON, IF YOU TELL -- IS THERE ANY MORE CHEATING? NO. OKAY, GOOD, JUST CHECKING, BECAUSE IF YOU TELL DANNY ABOUT NICK, THEY'LL KILL EACH OTHER. AT THE VERY LEAST, IT'LL RUIN THE FAMILY BUSINESS. YEAH, BUT IS THAT SO BAD? I MEAN, IT IS A CRIMINAL BUSINESS. I THINK THAT MAYBE WE CAN ALL LEARN FROM THIS. I HAD A THERAPIST ONCE TELL ME THAT BEING HONEST WITH SOMEONE YOU HURT IS ACTUALLY A SELFISH ACT. HOW? BY ALLEVIATING YOUR OWN PAIN, YOU PASS IT ALONG TO SOMEONE ELSE. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT! SO... OH, GOD! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME ABOUT THIS. I MEAN, THE TRUTH IS, I WAS DREADING TELLING ANYBODY ABOUT ME AND NICK. DANNY WOULD BE PRETTY MAD. DANNY? OH, NO. HIM, I CAN HANDLE. I WAS MORE WORRIED ABOUT HIS MOTHER. I MEAN, I THINK THE CRUSTY OLD BAG ALREADY KNEW, BUT -- WAIT. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? OH, I CAN JUST TELL. I MEAN, SHE HATES MY GUTS. YOU SHOULD SEE THE WAY THAT SHE LOOKS AT ME. SO, ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS OR WHAT? AH, THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT, REALLY. I MEAN, ALL OF SATAR'S RECORDS LOOK CLEAN. THESE WIRETAP TRANSCRIPTS DON'T TELL US WHO HE MIGHT BE USING FOR A PIPELINE -- NOTHING. I WAS TALKING ABOUT MIAMI... AND WHAT IT COULD MEAN FOR US. IT WAS ALL JUST... TEMPORARY, RIGHT? WASN'T THAT THE DEAL? TEMPORARY? YOUR TRANSFER HERE TO L.A... MOVING IN WITH ME. THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK? THAT'S WHAT WE AGREED ON, RIGHT? SO I GUESS WE COULD STILL SEE EACH OTHER ON SOME WEEKENDS? ABSOLUTELY. BUT I HAVE TO SAY, I THINK THE BEACHES OUT HERE ARE NICER. GOOD, BECAUSE I REALLY WANT THIS JOB. I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO HELP YOU GET IT. YEAH? WHERE? WHAT -- W OKAY. W-WAIT THERE. THAT WAS TY. HE FOLLOWED SATAR TO A WAREHOUSE. COULD BE SOMETHING. ARE YOU SURE HE'S STILL IN THERE? TY: We haven't seen him leave yet. ALL RIGHT, HOLD YOUR POSITION. WAREHOUSE WAS LEASED OUT TO A COMPANY CALLED ELR-TRANSPORT. THEY DO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING. IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE SATAR COULD USE TO MOVE HIS DIRTY BOMB. WHO'S THE NEW GUY? THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. IT'S 12 FLOORS UP! WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING HERE, NICK?! DANNY CALLED. THINKS HE FOUND THE GUY WHO SHOT UP THE CAR. COME ON. WAIT, WAIT. NICK, STOP. PLEASE. CAN I TALK TO YOU? JUST A SECOND. IT WAS YOU, MAN. COME ON, DON'T LIE TO ME. YOU PUT THAT HIT OUT ON YOUR BROTHER, DIDN'T YOU? TWO WEEKS AGO, YOU WERE ASKING ME TO HELP YOU KILL HIM, REMEMBER? THAT WAS TWO WEEKS AGO. A LOT'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN, ALL RIGHT? YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH, AND YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING. COME ON. OH! LOOK WHO IT IS! THAT PETROV? Danny: YEAH. I THOUGHT THEY DEPORTED YOUR ASS. WHO THE HELL IS THIS? HE'S CONNECTED WITH THE RUSSIAN MOB. THEY'VE HAD A HARD-ON FOR US EVER SINCE WE STARTED MOVING PHARMACEUTICALS. I DIDN'T SHOOT AT ANYBODY. I'M LEGIT NOW. I'M GOING TO NURSING SCHOOL. OKAY, SHUT UP! WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL US WHAT YOU DID? MAYBE WE'LL LET YOU GO. I DIDN'T DO NOTHING. PLEASE. TRUST ME. ALL RIGHT, OPTION TWO -- FIVE SECONDS, YOU'RE A DEAD MAN. TICK, TICK, TICK. Nick: FIVE. GUYS, PLEASE. FOUR! START TALKING, BUDDY. HELP ME! THREE! NO, PLEASE! TWO! PLEASE, GUYS! I DON'T KNOW NOTHING! AAH! IF HE KNEW SOMETHING, HE WOULD HAVE SAID IT. HOW DO YOU KNOW THE RUSSIAN WASN'T THE SHOOTER? TRUST ME -- HE WOULD HAVE SUNG. SO DANNY AND NICK ARE STILL LOOKING TO CAP WHOEVER DID IT. YEAH, AND THEY MAY EVEN CAP A FEW PEOPLE ON THE WAY TO CAPPING WHOEVER DID IT. WELL, I THINK IT WAS ANA. WHAT, THE MOM? YEAH, ANA TOLD ME A STORY ABOUT HOW HER BELOVED BOYS COULD NEVER SHARE THEIR TOYS. THE ONLY WAY SHE COULD KEEP THE PEACE WAS TO GET RID OF THE TOY. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE WAY SHE LOOKED AT SHARON WHEN SHE SAID IT. SO YOU THINK SHE KNOWS THAT SHARON'S SHTUPPING NICK? YEAH, AND DECIDED TO GET RID OF SHARON BEFORE IT CAUSED PROBLEMS BETWEEN HER DARLING BOYS. YOU THINK YOU CAN PROVE IT? I'LL NEED HELP. Carter: TRY IT OUT. WE NEED THEIR PIPELINE ONCE WE BLOW OUT BRYCE. AND HOW'S THAT GOING WITH BRYCE? TY'S WORKING ON SOMETHING. THIS IS GETTING CRAZY. AGENT RICE. YES, I'LL HOLD. I NEED TO TAKE THIS. IT'S HEAD OF COUNTER-TERRORISM IN D.C. FANCY. GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU. WHAT IS THIS? EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT. I PUT TOGETHER A FILE ON YOUR WIFE'S BOYFRIEND. LOOK, MAN, I KNOW YOU THINK WE'RE ALL SIMPATICO WITH THE WHOLE DIVORCE THING, BUT YOU CAN'T JUST -- YOU KNOW HE'S GOT A RECORD? A D.U.I. AND HE'S BEEN INVESTIGATED BY THE I.R.S. PROBABLY A TAX EVADER. AND CHECK THIS OUT. NEW KIND OF TRACKER. MAGNETICALLY SEALS TO A CAR DOOR, GIVES OFF A SIGNAL FOR THREE DAYS. I PUT ONE ON BRYCE'S CAR. AND ON YOUR WIFE'S REBOUND GUY. YOU PUT ONE OF THESE ON CHRIS' CAR? YEAH. YOU KNOW HE HANGS OUT IN ONE OF THE MOST DRUG YOU'RE WAY OUT OF LINE FOR THIS. THINK YOUR WIFE KNOWS ABOUT THAT? I MEAN, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO GET BACK TO HER. Alex: JASON BRYCE. C.E.O. OF THE COMPANY. THEY HANDLE SHIPPING AND FREIGHT FOR OVERSEAS VENDORS. DOES HE HAVE A JACKET? THE GUY'S A CAREER DRUG SMUGGLER. DID A STINT IN A COLOMBIAN JAIL ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO FOR SMUGGLING COKE. BUT HE'S GOTTEN SMARTER SINCE, USING HIS CONTACTS TO HELP BUILD A SHIPPING BUSINESS. Carter: HIS COMPANY'S BEEN INVESTIGATED AT LEAST 10 TIMES FOR SMUGGLING CONTRABAND AND DRUGS. PAPER TRAIL LEADING BACK TO HIM WAS ALWAYS SPOTTY. BRYCE HAS DOZENS OF SHELL COMPANIES, EACH WITH DIFFERENT IMPORT ROUTES. WHY CAN'T WE SIT ON HIM AND WATCH FOR SATAR'S SHIPMENT? TOO MANY ROUTES. IT'D BE VERY EASY TO MISS SOMETHING COMING IN. WE NEED TO FIGURE A WAY TO ELBOW BRYCE OUT AND GET SATAR INTERESTED IN THE PERRYS AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW, CARTER. WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE GUY PRETTY CLOSELY. HOME IN THE VALLEY, 4-YEAR-OLD IN PRIVATE SCHOOL. THE MOST DANGEROUS CAT HE HANGS OUT WITH BESIDES SATAR IS HIS DRY CLEANER -- THERE'S NOTHING ON THE GUY. KEEP DIGGING. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING. ALL RIGHT. I WENT BY THE BOUTIQUE, AND SHE WASN'T EVEN THERE. SORRY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHARON IS. WELL, SHE MUST BE PRETTY SHAKEN UP BECAUSE THE BULLETS ONLY MISSED HER BY A HAIR. OH, THAT'S SUCH A SHAME. ANYWAYS, I JUST HOPE SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING STUPID. I THINK YOU'RE ASKING A LOT. WELL, I'M JUST SAYING SHE REALLY NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF RIGHT NOW. ESPECIALLY NOW. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU DON'T KNOW? OH. SHOOT. I-I BET SHE WAS GONNA SURPRISE YOU. I DON'T LIKE SURPRISES. YOU'RE GONNA BE A GRANDMA, ANA. SHE'S PREGNANT. WHAT? YEAH. SHE TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY. OH, PLEASE DON'T TELL HER THAT I TOLD YOU. OKAY. IS IT ON? Shh! Shh! Shh! Ana: YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS? GOOD. I WANT TO CANCEL MY ORDER. YOU'LL STILL GET PAID, BUT I WANT IT OFF. YOU UNDERSTAND? WHAT THE HELL? I GUESS OL' ANA ISN'T AS COLD-BLOODED AS WE THOUGHT. DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D RATHER HAVE -- A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW LIKE SHARON OR A MOTHER-IN-LAW LIKE ANA. I'D RATHER DIE ALONE. WHAT ABOUT NICK AND DANNY? THEY STILL THINK THE SHOOTER'S OUT THERE. COME ON... YOU DON'T THINK I ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT? WE WERE HOPING TO GET SOMETHING ON BRYCE WE COULD EXPLOIT, BUST HIM, AND STEER SATAR BACK TO THE PERRYS. BUT SO FAR, HE'S BEEN COMPLETELY CLEAN. I THOUGHT BRYCE WAS A KNOWN TRAFFICKER? KNOWING HE IS AND HAVING PROOF ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS GUY'S A DEAD END? I'M JUST TELLING YOU WHERE WE ARE. THEN THE ONLY ADVICE I CAN OFFER -- THINK OF SOMETHING, FAST. WE'RE HEARING INCREASED CHATTER ABOUT THE DIRTY BOMB. AGENT CLARK, BRYCE MAY NOT BE A DEAD END. YOU GOT SOMETHING ON HIM? THAT DEPENDS HOW BADLY YOU WANT THIS DIRTY BOMB. YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO WASHINGTON EMPTY WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME? ROOM TO MANEUVER. TO DO WHAT? DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW? NO. TAKE ALL THE ROOM THAT YOU NEED. Dean: HEY. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS. ALL RIGHT, SO, I PUT THE WORD OUT WITH MY FRIENDS. AND IT TURNS OUT THIS GUY I KNOW, J.D. -- WE USED TO RIP I.D.s WAY BACK. LONG STORY. HE WAS AT A BAR THE OTHER NIGHT, OKAY, AND THERE'S THIS PUNK THERE TALKING ABOUT HOW HE JUST SHOT UP SOME GUY'S CAR, RIGHT? WELL, I DID SOME DIGGING. AND... ...VOILá. HEY, HEY, YOU! TIME TO WAKE UP! OKAY? YOU TELL HIM WHAT YOU TOLD ME. I KNEW THE ARMENIAN DUDES YOU USED TO SUPPLY ALL THE FAKE VIAGRA TO -- VASEK AND HIS CREW. VASEK'S IN JAIL, MAN. YEAH, BUT HE USED TO BUY FROM ME BEFORE YOU GUYS MOVED IN. YEAH, WELL, GUESS WHAT? THIS GUY HERE -- HE'S YOUR COMPETITION. OH, MAN, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS YOUR LADY INSTEAD OF YOU IN THE CAR, EITHER. I DIDN'T KNOW. YEAH, WELL, IT WAS. SHE ALMOST GOT KILLED. HMM NO, I'M NOT HAPPY. BUT I WILL BE WHEN HE'S DEAD. OKAY. I'LL DO HIM. NO, NO. I'LL DO HIM. NO. DAN! TAKE HIM OUT TO THE DESERT AND BURY HIM. WHAT THE HELL?! YOU LET THEM SHOOT HIM? NAH. HE'S FINE. THEY'RE BLANKS. THAT -- THAT WAS AWESOME! WE NEVER GET TO DO THIS KIND OF STUFF! WHAT'S A JOB IF YOU CAN'T HAVE FUN? LET'S GO. DRIVE. HEY, SO, THE PERRYS ARE ALL GOOD. WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOOD, BUT NOBODY'S TRYING TO KILL ANYONE ANY LONGER. SOUNDS LIKE PROGRESS. HOW'S IT GOING WITH BRYCE? YOU GOT ANYTHING TO BLOW HIM OUT YET? WORKING ON IT. SO, GOT SOME NEWS -- THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT RECEIVED A TIP OFF A C.I. ABOUT A DOPE SHIPMENT INVOLVING BRYCE. THEY RAIDED HIS WAREHOUSE THIS MORNING AND FOUND TWO KEYS OF COKE. THEY'VE GOT HIM IN CUSTODY RIGHT NOW. SATAR GIVE ANY INSIGHT TO KEVIN? TY? SORRY. UM, NOTHING FROM KEVIN YET. ALL RIGHT, GET KEVIN BACK IN PLAY WITH SATAR, SEE IF HE CAN GET HIM BACK INTERESTED IN ME AND THE PERRYS. TY. I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SLEEPWALKING THROUGH THIS CASE. IT'S MEL, MAN. I, UM... CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO SIGN THE DIVORCE PAPERS. YOU THINK MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU LET IT GO? I CAN'T. LOOK, I GET IT. I'VE BEEN THERE. DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. BUT GET YOUR HEAD BACK IN THE GAME. CAUGHT A LUCKY BREAK. IT HAPPENS. I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TALK TO SATAR. JUST GOT TO MAKE A QUICK STOP FIRST. MEL! DUDE, THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA! TY, Y-YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP SHOWING UP HERE LIKE THIS. I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. YOU'RE STARTING TO SCARE HER, MAN. THIS DON'T CONCERN YOU, BROTHER. CHRIS, I'M FINE. JUST -- CAN YOU JUST MEET ME AT THE CAR? JUST KEEP WALKING, DUDE. YOU THINK I CARE THAT YOU'RE A COP HEY! HEY! HEY! STOP IT! STOP IT! Kevin: NO, NO. STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP! IT'S A BAD IDEA, BRO. WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM? YOU KNOW HE'S GOT A RECORD WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HE'S GOT A D.U.I., MEL, HE'S BEEN INVESTIGATED BY THE I.R.S., HANGS OUT IN ONE OF THE MOST DRUG-INFESTED HOODS IN -- YOU'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING HIM? I'M LOOKING OUT FOR YOU. NO, NO, NO. YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR YOURSELF. YOU LIKE CHASING THE BAD GUYS, AND YOU LIKE MEETING GIRLS. AND THAT'S FINE. JUST OWN UP TO IT. MEL, COME ON. YOU NEED TO LEAVE. OH, AND, UH, THE REASON THAT HE HANGS OUT IN THE "HOOD" IS BECAUSE HE DOES PRO-BONO WORK FOR WELFARE CASES. PRO-BONO WORK, KEVIN. DUDE, THIS ISN'T WORKING FOR ME. HOW DO YOU AVOID CUSTOMS? Danny: FLOWERS ARE PERISHABLE ITEMS. SO IF THEY GO BAD WHILE WAITING FOR INSPECTION, THE GOVERNMENT'S LIABLE. Carter: THE BEAUTIFUL THING IS THAT EVERYTHING IS PRE-CLEARED IN THE AIR. CUSTOMS NEVER LAYS EYES ON THEM. SMART. YEAH, WE LIKE TO THINK SO. SO, WHAT IS THE PROCESS? WE GET FLOWERS SENT EVERY OTHER DAY FROM MEXICO CITY. YOU BRING YOUR LOAD TO OUR PACKING PLANT, AND WE MOVE IT. HOW MUCH CAN YOU HANDLE? WE CAN HANDLE WHATEVER YOU CAN GET THERE. PRICE IS 20% OF YOUR WHOLESALE COST. AND YOUR FEE? WE CAN WORK THAT OUT AFTER YOU GET YOUR DRUGS. OKAY, THEN. I HOPE THIS IS THE START OF A BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP. ME TOO. Carter: SATAR'S ALREADY ARRANGED TO HAVE HIS LOAD DELIVERED TO THE PERRYS' PLANT IN MEXICO. SHOULD ARRIVE IN L.A. TOMORROW. ALL RIGHT, ONCE WE SECURE THE DIRTY BOMB, I'LL COORDINATE WITH HOMELAND SECURITY. D.E.A. ALSO WANTS TO BE LOOPED IN. ANY WORD ON THE PROMOTION? NOT YET. WELL, SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A LOCK. CAN WE TALK? IN PRIVATE? I WAS ABOUT TO CALL YOU. LIEUTENANT SHAW JUST CONFIRMED THAT SATAR'S SHIPMENT IS COMING INTO L.A. TOMORROW. YEAH. BUT THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN PLANS. I DON'T WANT YOU TO SECURE SATAR'S LOAD. THIS IS BECOMING A HABIT OF YOURS. WE JUST RECEIVED NEW INTEL. SATAR'S NOT MOVING DIRTY-BOMB COMPONENTS IN THIS LOAD. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT GOING TO. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? KEEP SATAR IN BUSINESS WITH THE PERRYS. LET HIM KEEP SMUGGLING DRUGS IN. IF WE GET LUCKY, WE'LL EVENTUALLY CATCH HIM WITH A DIRTY BOMB. WAIT A MINUTE. "IF WE GET LUCKY"? HOW REAL IS THE THREAT? WE HEAR CHATTER ALL THE TIME. AND IT PROBABLY DOESN'T HURT TO HAVE A DIRTY BOMB ON THE RéSUMé. YOU'RE THE ONE ON THE SHORT LIST FOR MIAMI. WHAT ABOUT THE DRUGS? WE LET THEM GO THROUGH. IT'S 50 KEYS OF PURE HEROIN. AND THAT'S FOR THE LOCALS. LIEUTENANT SHAW ISN'T GONNA LET THE DRUGS HIT THE STREET. WELL, THEN CALL HIM OFF. HE WON'T LISTEN TO ME. HE MAY NOT HAVE A CHOICE. WE SET UP A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA OUTSIDE OF BRYCE'S WAREHOUSE. LOOKS LIKE CARTER PLANTED THE DRUGS THAT GOT BRYCE ARRESTED. YOU LET LIEUTENANT SHAW KNOW IF HE TRIES TO INTERFERE, I'LL BURY HIM. Carter: I REALIZE THAT. I JUST -- WHAT ARE YOU, A COUPLES THERAPIST? I JUST WANT YOU TO BUY THE DAMN THING BACK, ALL RIGHT? I'LL CALL YOU BACK. DID YOU PLANT EVIDENCE ON BRYCE? WHAT? IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. REALLY? 'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU PLANTED EVIDENCE. YEAH, WELL, DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SEE. AFTER WE BUST SATAR AND GET THE DIRTY BOMB -- THERE IS NO DIRTY BOMB. WHAT THE HELL YOU TALKING ABOUT? I JUST SPOKE WITH CLARK. HE HAS NEW INTEL. THERE'S NO DIRTY BOMB. BUT HE WANTS US TO KEEP SATAR IMPORTING HEROIN UNTIL HE CATCHES ONE, IF THERE IS ONE. WHAT ABOUT THE DRUGS? WE LET THEM GO. 50 KEYS OF PURE HEROIN?! BY THE TIME IT'S CUT AND DISTRIBUTED, THAT'S LIKE 150 KEYS. I'M AWARE OF THAT. I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN! YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE! IF YOU TRY AND INTERFERE, CLARK'S GONNA END YOUR CAREER. IS IT MY JOB OR YOUR JOB YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HERE, AL? EXCUSE ME? YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS BEFORE. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU PLANTED EVIDENCE BEFORE. YOU KNEW I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. YOU JUST DIDN'T WANT TO ASK. DON'T TURN THIS AROUND ON ME. I'M NOT LETTING HEROIN FREE-FLOW INTO L.A.! CLARK WILL COME AFTER YOU. I DON'T CARE. LET HIM. IF YOU WANT TO HANG YOURSELF, GO AHEAD, BUT I'M NOT GOING DOWN WITH YOU. YOU HAVE ENOUGH HANDS FOR ALL THOSE GUNS? Dean: HEY, YOU KNOW, ALEX CALLED LAST NIGHT. SHE SAID THE BUST IS OFF AND THAT WE SHOULD STAND DOWN. YOU DID GET THAT MEMO, DIDN'T YOU? NOT FOR ME. Ty: YEAH, WE KIND OF FIGURED THAT. HEY, SO YOU DID PLANT THOSE DRUGS ON BRYCE, DIDN'T YOU? YES. YOU DID IT TO HELP ALEX GET HER PROMOTION, HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? BECAUSE YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH HER. COME ON, PLEASE. WE MADE YOU WEEKS AGO. SHOCKER. SO WHAT? ANSWER THE QUESTION. YES. AGENT CLARK WANTS US TO GIVE SATAR A FREE PASS, LET HIM KEEP IMPORTING HEROIN UNTIL HE CATCHES A DIRTY BOMB. WELL, THE SHIPMENT ARRIVED OVER AN HOUR AGO. WE SHOULD SPLIT UP, CARTER, TAKE SATAR AT THE SAME TIME WE TAKE PERRY. LISTEN, I CAN'T ASK YOU TO HELP ME ON THIS ONE. I'M ABOUT TO DIRECTLY DEFY FBI ORDERS. YEAH. WE KNOW. SO, DID YOU GET SHAW TO BACK OFF? I TOLD HIM WHAT YOU HAVE ON HIM. GOOD. LET THE LOCALS DEAL WITH THE CLEAN-UP. WE'RE BIG-GAME HUNTING. IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING? DON'T GO NATIVE ON ME, ALEX. YOU'RE NOT L.A.P.D. BESIDES... IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE ALREADY MADE AN IMPRESSION. YOU GOT THE MIAMI JOB. THANK YOU. I'M SURPRISED. STAY CLOSE TO YOUR PHONE. THE DIRECTOR'S GONNA CALL YOU. HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? EH, YOU KNOW, JUST CAME TO SEE IF YOU NEEDED ANY HELP. IF I NEEDED YOU, I WOULD HAVE CALLED YOU. WHERE'S DANNY? WHY THE HELL DO YOU CARE? BECAUSE I'M HERE TO ARREST YOU. L.A.P.D. DON'T DO THAT. PUT THAT GUN DOWN RIGHT NOW. L.A.P.D.! EVERYBODY ON THE GROUND! WAIT! WAIT! I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS! SHARON, SHUT THE HELL UP. PUT THE GUN DOWN, DANNY! Dean: DANNY, I'LL BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF. SWEAR TO GOD. HERS TOO. TRY ME. LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS. I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING! OH, LADY, YOU SCARE ME THE MOST! HANDS! THIS IS OVER. THIS IS OVER, DANNY. OKAY, CUFF 'EM. MAN, JUST HAD TO EXPAND THE BUSINESS, HUH? SHUT UP. BOTH OF YOU SHUT UP. HOW ABOUT THAT? JUST HAD TO BE A BALLER, DIDN'T YOU? YOU'RE AN IDIOT, NICK. YEAH? YEAH, WELL... THIS IDIOT'S BEEN BANGING YOUR WIFE. I'M SORRY. WHAT DID YOU SAY? OH, GOD. I SAID, "THIS IDIOT'S BEEN BANGING YOUR WIFE." THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT YOU SAID. ALL RIGHT, NOW I'M READY. POLICE! AAH! GO, CARTER. I GOT THIS! GO! GO! GO! CARTER? THIS IS SPECIAL AGENT ALEX RICE. I HAVE AN OFFICER DOWN. OFFICER DOWN! What took you so long? ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH. DOCTORS SAY HE'S GONNA BE FINE. GOOD. AT LEAST HE DIDN'T GET SHOT FOR NOTHING. L.A.P.D. SHUT DOWN THE PERRYS, SATAR, AND GOT THE DRUGS BACK -- IN DIRECT DEFIANCE TO EVERY ONE OF MY ORDERS. THEY'RE PART OF MY TASK FORCE. I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY. YOU DON'T NEED TO. THEY ALL SWORE UP AND DOWN YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. WHAT ABOUT LIEUTENANT SHAW? YOU GONNA PURSUE AN INVESTIGATION? DOESN'T LOOK LIKE I CAN. TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE USED TO BUST BRYCE WAS ONLY 10% PURE. JUST ENOUGH TO REGISTER IN A FIELD TEST AND MAKE AN ARREST, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE A CASE ONCE THE LAB ANALYZED IT. YOU KICKED BRYCE FREE? JUST A FEW HOURS AGO. IT WAS A SMART MOVE. GOT BRYCE OFF THE STREET LONG ENOUGH TO SET UP SATAR. SO NO DISCIPLINARY ACTION? FOR WHAT? PLANTING BABY LAXATIVE? I'LL AVOID THE EMBARRASSMENT. SO WE'RE GOOD, EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T GET A DIRTY BOMB? I'M MAN ENOUGH TO ADMIT WHEN I'VE BEEN OUTPLAYED. BUT I WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING. WHAT'S THAT? YOU DID GO NATIVE. DOCTOR SAID A FEW MORE MINUTES, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE BLED OUT. YOU WERE LUCKY. MAYBE NOW YOU'LL WEAR YOUR VEST. YOU IN A LOT OF PAIN? ACTUALLY, I'M PRETTY HIGH RIGHT NOW. MORPHINE DRIP. I'M SUPPOSED TO PRESS IT EVERY TIME I'M UNCOMFORTABLE. Dean: WOW. Jaimie: OH, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? IT'S FROM KEVIN. APOLOGIZES FOR, UH, ANY MISCOMMUNICATION, AND HE SENDS HIS WELL WISHES, BROTHER. WELL, TY, UM, REALLY, I'M -- I'M TOUCHED, BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD GIVE IT TO THE KID NEXT DOOR. TAKE THE CALL, TY. I SPOKE WITH AGENT CLARK. ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU, YOU DID A GREAT JOB BUSTING A MAJOR DRUG NETWORK. SO THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING OR ANYTHING? NO. CAN I TALK TO CARTER ALONE? WHY ALONE? IT'S CLASSIFIED. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? THEY KNOW. IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE. HEY, LOOK, I WAS WRONG ABOUT CHRIS. HE SEEMS LIKE A REALLY GOOD GUY. YEP. MM-HMM. OF COURSE. I WANT THE SAME THING FOR YOU, MEL. ALL RIGHT. BYE. EVERYTHING OKAY? YEAH. THAT WAS MELISSA. I SIGNED THE DIVORCE PAPERS. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH. I'M OKAY. HEY. SEE YOU. YOU BUY IT? YEAH. YEAH, I DO. DINNER? ARE YOU ASKING ME ON A DATE? I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT ASKING YOU OUT ON A DATE. OH, WELL, THEN IN THAT CASE... FOR THE RECORD, LET IT BE KNOWN I HAVE NO INTEREST IN YOU... NOR AM I ATTRACTED TO YOU... NOR DO I WANT TO -- OKAY, DUDE, I GET IT. DON'T RUIN A NICE MOMENT. PRETTY SLICK WITH BRYCE. I LIKE TO KEEP UP THE MYSTIQUE. SO... I GOT MY PROMOTION. GOOD. YOU DESERVE IT. YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T NEED TO GET SHOT TO STOP ME FROM LEAVING. DID I DO THAT? ALL YOU HAD TO SAY WAS THREE WORDS. THREE WORDS? YEAH. "PLEASE DON'T GO." PLEASE... DON'T... GO. I'LL BET THAT HURT MORE THAN THE BULLET. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. IT WAS NICE OF YOU TO SAY, BUT I ALREADY TURNED IT DOWN. I THINK I'M GONNA PASS OUT NOW. Nurse: EXCUSE ME. MR. SHAW'S PERSONAL EFFECTS. THANK YOU.
