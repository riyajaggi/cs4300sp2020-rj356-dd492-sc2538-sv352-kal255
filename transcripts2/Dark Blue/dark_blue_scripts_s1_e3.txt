 Dark Blue (2009â€“2010): Season 1, Episode 3 - Purity - full transcript 
 Slick mob lawyer Howard has started dealing himself. Dean tries entrapment, but his all too perfect cover makes the fiend wake out and execute the henchman who 'failed to do his screening homework thoroughly'. When rookie Jamie comes up with the alternative plan to work on Howard's quality control chemist Reuben Pike, Carter allow her to take the lead. Dean advised against it but saves her butt, thus finds out about her dirty past, yet covers for her after her cover, as Ruben's partner, requires relapsing into cocaine use.

 Good evening, Mr. Howard. Howard's here. Looks like he has the money too. 'Sorry about the delay. The 405.' The back's clear. As soon as Howard makes the buy, we take him. When I was a defense attorney.. ...the one thing I had to do was check out prospective clients. Look into their history. Make sure they're not withholding vital information. 'Which could come back at you.' It's a funny thing when we looked into you.

 Some things just don't add up. Well...I'm not a perspective client and you're not a defense attorney. What you are is late. Now your boy here, said you are looking for a new supplier. And that's why I'm here. So you got the money or not? I see you worked with Vince Halpin. He was a lunatic. Yeah, he was. and that's why he got himself killed. Yeah, the funny thing is.. ...all the guys you worked with are dead. Well that makes it very hard to get a reference. Now, either you're the worst luck charm in the world.. '...or it's by design.'

 ' - 'I donno know what you are.' Ty, get in position. This may go sideways. - I'm on the move. If there's no money in the briefcase then it's technically not a buy and we have no case. We gotta see the money first. If I'm a cop, how come you're not face down on the floor? If you are, you know you can't make an arrest without intent to buy. And if there's no money in here.. ...then there's no intent. I guess you came all the way down here for a glass of Sake? Carter, I'm there. All right. Don't move until I say so. Look, I donno what you heard or who you've talked to. But I'm no cop. Bryant, will you please tell him this? I asked around, Andre. He checked out. Well, I mean, you think I'm wearing a wire too, right? Right? Think I'm wearing a wire, guys? Come on. I'm here to make a deal with you Mr. Howard. That's it. Come on. Carter. Carter, I need an answer. Are we really going to let Howard walk? Hey, look, you're being a little paranoid here. That's funny. I used to tell my clients that. Carter. 'Back off.' This is the second time you didn't vet someone properly. You're gonna stand there all night? - We should've taken him. No money, no arrest. It took us five weeks undercover, Carter. - Just to get that meeting. - Might be my last shot. Maybe not. Your cover's not blown yet. Your contacts-- Bryant, he's not gonna want to set up a deal after that. Apologize, grovel, pay him off. Do whatever you need to do to get back inside. It's not exactly low-hanging fruit, Carter. It's all we got. Hey, how long you been up, superfly? - I'm still the new kid. Yeah, I know that you can't talk about it so.. 'I'm not even gonna ask.' Man, I have lost more socks in this place. - I gotta get going too. - Now that is hot. What do you say, you bring that back to bed with us, huh? You're gonna make us both late...again. Well, it wouldn't be an issue if we lived together. Are you serious? What do you think? I don't-I don't know. - It's been three months. - Four. Actually, for the record, it's been four but.. ...you think about it. I'm gonna be late for my pre-trial with the judge. Have a good day. Hey, Bryant, it's Dean. Bryant? Bryant? Been calling you like ten times, man. Gotta talk about last night. You sure it was Howard? Howard was not happy that Bryant set him up with me. The'll find another way back in. Security. Maybe we go in as Howard's muscle. No, he never takes on new guys. I know how we get back in. Reuben Pike. Okay, thanks. We know him. He's Howard's tester. I pulled his file. He was a pharmaceutical engineer until two years ago. Then got busted on two charges of possession. This guy isn't a hardcore criminal. At least not like the others. I think he's doable. Doable for what? He doesn't know anything. We use him. Trade him up for somebody bigger in Howard's organization. Could be something there. Check it out. Hold on...I found this lead. It's mine. You have never run point before. And you won't get him the same way you got Bryant. This is not the problem, okay? You can't get a dance by just shakin' your ass. Jaimie, we use the two things that make America great. Greed. Pride. That's it. He's not looking to impress Howard. Or move up. Look at him. He doesn't wanna be there. He's damaged goods. He's trapped. He's doable. Considering your history, you can understand why I'm not wild about putting you inside on a drug case. So, I'm gonna ask you just once. Can you handle this? I know how to do this guy, Carter. We're gonna follow Jaimie's lead. She's on point. Biggest mistake you'll make is getting tripped up in your lies. You take parts of your own life and use 'em. 'Then you can react on instinct.' Reuben asks you where you're from you don't have to think? You listening to me? 'Cause I'm trying to keep you alive. - Yeah, I got it. A hundred percent. - Not how I would've gone after. - It's a smart way in. Yeah, if she gets him. It wasn't just the drugs. I mean, yeah, being an addict didn't help but it was more the lies. Being sober is like you've stepped out of this.. ...bad suit you've been wearing and you get to take a long look at yourself. Guess, I'm just trying to stay out of that suit. Thanks. We've got a few more minutes. Anyone else? Great. My name is Jaimie. I just moved here two weeks ago. And this is my first meeting in LA. What Reuben was saying about wearing the bad suit.. ...sounds like we had the same tailor. 'Thanks for helping me clean up.' 'Thanks for listening. I must be boring the hell out of you.' No. I want to hear, uh...when did you say you ran away? I was sixteen. I think. It's hard to remember. I was really screwed up. How did you live? Lie, cheat, steal. You were just a kid. I once was so high I drove my boyfriend's car through 'the window of a pet store.' You really found her on patrol? ' - Valley division. 'The judge took pity and put me in a state detox.' - Nobody learns that on patrol. - 'That must've been tough.' Nobody said she did. That was pretty much my bottom. I can beat that. Hit my bottom when my wife caught me smoking crack in the bathroom at her nephew's christening. That's rough. - I didn't. She left me. 'And I lost my job, lost my house.' I even fell into debt with my dealer. Do you still talk to her? - Your ex-wife. - I try. But.. The thing is she didn't really leave because of the drugs she left...because of the lies. You know. I just couldn't be honest. But, getting sober. Getting out of debt. I'm really just trying to get her back. You're a good guy. You'll get her back. I had to catch my bus anyway. I know. I'm the only person in LA without a car. - No, I kinda like it. Maybe to the next meeting. - It's a deal. - Okay. Did I keep it simple enough for you? Don't pop the chrysie yet. You didn't get any closer to Howard. I gotta number. A ride to the next meeting. I got Reuben on the hook. Damn...Maynard. Keep working Reuben. Good job, Jaimie. Thank you, Jaimie. You're welcome, Carter. You're barking up the wrong tree, honey. And how much of that story you told was true? - None of it. - Come on. The pet store. The detox center. I heard it all in a hype I busted last year. I told the chief what you told me that we would have Howard by now. What happened? We didn't go deep enough with Dean's cover. Howard's way too connected from his defense attorney days. He probably has contacts with the courts, parole board former clients...maybe even the department. He also has friends. Howard makes huge political contributions. Helped make Guardado the city controller. People upstairs are already nervous that he's in play. The fact that Howard wears a suit and golfs to Mayor's country club doesn't make him untouchable. You missed. You're not the first with Howard. Move on. Really? Gimme two days. Plenty of criminals out there. You can't get them all. Two days. And for the record, I want Howard too. We've been tailing this guy all morning and so far he's bought a coffee and picked up some dry cleaning. Carter called three times last night. He wants something we can use. Maybe he'll buy a dirty magazine. We could roll up on him, scare the crap out of him, right? ' - Must be the ex-wife. This guy seems pretty needy, uh? You know what needy people like? Other needy people. Jaimie, the meeting starts in five minutes. We're gonna be.. I'm sorry. I was gonna call you to cancel. What happened? Were you robbed? - No, it wasn't.. - Take it slow. Sit down. - I don't wanna involve you. - It's alright. Tell me. It's humiliating. You're talking to the guy who got high in a church bathroom. It's okay...I wanna help. It's my ex-boyfriend. He's a dealer in Denver. Nothing big, pot, some meth.. I stole money from him to move out here. I didn't know he was gonna come looking for me. - You should call the police. - No. You don't know him. He's crazy. If he knew I called the cops.. - I have to pay him back. How much do you need? - Twelve thousand. - That's a lot. I have an idea. I know this guy I used to work for in setting up buys. - Supply and demand. Maybe we can do this together. Every time I set up a deal for him, I got a finder's fee. I thought we could introduce him to the dealer you said you knew. I once made sixteen thousand from this guy, Reuben. - We could split it fifty-fifty. - Wait. Hold on. I'm trying to get away from all that. But you said you needed money too. - I do. - You could get out of debt. You could show your ex-wife that you're doing better. - I'd have to meet him first. And Howard doesn't mess around with small quantities. It'd have to be a big enough deal to interest him. I'll ask what he can get. You need a place to stay? No, uh...I got a motel room. I'll call you after I talk to my friend. - Reuben. Thanks. Nice. Prison records, arrest report. The most we've done for a cover. It better be. We didn't go deep enough last time with Dean. Howard is gonna look at it all. I'll get it all into LAPD database. Federal. There's still something missing. We need that one thing he's not expecting. What kinda quantity is he talking about? Reuben says 10 keys minimum. Yeah, but we still have those 10 keys I tried to sell Howard. Good. Ty, get with Jaimie and this Reuben guy. - It was her idea. But you know what, I'm starting to feel a bit like your snitch. If you don't trust her, just dump her. Find somebody else. She's got something. Stay with her. - It's a chromatograph. Measures the breakdown of the chemical components in this substance. Measures purity. Oh, so you like quality control. You could say that. - This is only 41% pure. But, it's real. Howard serves an elite clientele. 'He's not gonna buy something this low-grade.' I can't take this to him. Look here, buddy, you...you're set to make a lot of money. Ten percent of this. You're looking at a clear twenty, twenty-five grand. I'll tell you right now he'll never go for it. Trey, no. You run my product through your little magic machine and you tell me it's no good? You trying to play me? Is this some kind of bargaining tool? - No. - Punk. You okay? Guys like that are the reason I'm getting out of this. - I know. I'm sorry. - I like you. I wanna help you. But not this way. I need to get my life back on track. This isn't helping. You can't threaten Rubin. He's not gonna respond to that. I was trying to save it. 'Cause right now we got nothing. - Carter, my cover's still good. - If Reuben still trusts me. - Can't make a deal with Howard. - I'll try something else. - I'm not seeing it. - I can still use him. - Then show me! You got a day. And then you are off. He knows you want his approval. I'm guessing you have some daddy issues, huh? Boy, you read me like an open book, Dean. - I'm a good liar. - We're all good liars. - No, you're okay. You get by on your smile. Bad boy charm. You couldn't do what I do. You gonna help me with this or not? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have put you in that position. - Truce. - It's alright. What're you gonna do about the money? Uh, my grandmother gave me this stuff. Might be worth something. Can you give me a ride? A lot of work for sixty bucks. That's where I hocked my wedding ring. - No. - She's in fashion. She lives down town...Wait. I know you. Police. Up against the car. Both of you. Up against the car. - Up against the car. What've you got in the trunk? Let me see it. Open it. Why? - Open the Trunk! Just do it, Reuben. - Wait! - Get on your knees. 'Get down. Don't move.' - Stay on your knees. - Okay. You are under arrest, sir, for concealing a dangerous weapon. - I'm a cop, Reuben. Let's go. You have two prior possession. This makes strike three. That's federal. 25 years minimum or you play ball with us. - Set up a buy with Howard. This is entrapment. You planted those drugs in my trunk. Where It's a word of a twice convicted drug addict against two police officers. That really the strongest way to go? I can blow your case without even stepping into court. Call him. I'll dial for you. Ask him how well that worked out with Bryant. Howard killed Bryant just for meeting with me. How do you think he'd feel about you talking to a couple of cops? I'm asking you what you already agreed to do. I thought I was helping you. It's your chance to help yourself, you said you wanted out from under Howard. This is the way to go. And if I want to take my chances? Maybe you'll walk and maybe Howard won't put a bullet in the back of your head. Either way, we do a perp-walk with your ex-wife. What do you think the chances of getting her back are then? I can't believe you. Or you get to tell her you put away a major drug dealer. What? You found drugs in his trunk? I was finding a way back in. I asked him for a ride. He popped the trunk. It was the strongest way to go. - Ah, I ID'd myself as a cop. This would've been three strikes. Twenty-five mandatory. We got him to play ball. - Yeah. 'What about the purity issue?' That drug's still only forty percent pure, Carter. That's all you need. When you meet with Howard.. ...Rueben will test the drugs like he always does. We'll get him to lie, tell the drugs are better.. Howard makes the buy. And we got him. Now we gotta make your cover bullet proof. - This guy does not play. - Got it. Howard's client list. 'We got the perfect guy we could use.' Good, good, good. Make this happen. - He went for it. - Well, you sold it pretty hard. 'With Reuben too.' They call you T-Wall. Your kid brother's doing five to seven in Lompoc because he tried to rob a bank with a BB gun. Young and dumb. Which has been keeping his nights and showers busy. I hear...he hasn't been able to sit straight for weeks. - Social services. I reunite families. You want your brother here? Under your protection. You'll do as I say. You know him? Sure you do. Can you rig that to make the coke look more pure? It take some time. When's the meeting with Howard? He hasn't called me back yet. I can't force him to meet you. One more thing. I want to see my ex-wife before we do this. - You can see her after. - Told you what's gonna happen. Sorry, if I don't just take your word for it. This will be the best thing for you. Five minutes and you get a second lease on life. Stop insulting my intelligence. You don't care about me. You used me. You took all I care and turned it against me. Who does that? I didn't tell you to become an addict or lie to your wife. You blew that all on your own. Yeah, I might be a degenerate liar but at least I'm ashamed of it. - Make that work. - Hey, hey, hey. Look, that is just part of the deal, okay? - Do not let him get to you. - I'm fine. Call me if anything happens. So he keeps asking me if I filed it. Like I would lie about something like that. Oh, I must've dropped it. These look like the pictures that come with frames. What do you mean? I was just noticing, you don't have any pictures of your, uh.. ...family or anyone for that matter. When I moved to LA the shipping company lost my stuff. It was all in one box. So you can call anyone from your family to ask for replacements? - I'm just making conversation. Really? It feels like you're interrogating me. - You are! Is this about moving in? Are you mad because I didn't say yes right away? Woah, woah, woah. That's not what I'm talking about. Hello? I'm...give me some time to get everything together. I'll call you back. - I've gotta go. That's work. We'll talk later. Uh, you know what? Let's not. You just do...whatever it is you're doing. Thought you said he was gonna set up a meeting with Ty. Ty wants to meet me first for some kinda audition. He wants my name. We didn't work on a cover story. If he saw me the same way as Dean. - I wasn't supposed to meet him. It's Reuben. Again. Howard's waiting. What do I do? - Use your name. - He'll know I'm a cop. No.. ...your real name. Everything's in place to get Howard. We won't get another chance, Jaimie.. ...I know I've been hard on you but you have to make this work. Give him your name. It'll hold up. What the hell was that? Reuben.. This is the first time I've seen you with a girl. I actually need a second to readjust my mental image of you. Jaimie, right? Andre. I'm glad to see you expanding your social horizons. I was worried about you being so hung up on your ex. - We're just friends. - That's too bad. Um, Jaimie knows someone you might be interested in meeting. - He has high quality product. And tested it, Andre. It's seventy seven percent. The purest stuff I've seen in a long time. And what do you get for this? Finder's fee. Ten percent? ' - I'm not in it for a favor. And huh, what's your friend's name? - Trey Norton. - Trey Norton. Right. Alright, Reuben. You can go. - We came in her car. - Farris will drive you home. Reuben. Leave. So, your friend Trey. You meet him back in your wild days back in, uh, Detroit? - You've done your homework. Yeah, that's what I do, Jaimie. Jaimie, I got Reuben leaving with Howard's boy. I'm gonna stay with him. I donno if they're gonna kill him or what. I'll be back when I can. You have a very interesting record. Possession. State detox. Breaking and entering? Sounds like you had a hard life since the projects in Detroit. - I learn to get by. - Oh, I can see that. 'How did you not end up in jail?' Very nasty, nasty crowd you are running with. And who was that guy? Phoenix. Was he a boyfriend or or some poor bastard you were using? You want to meet my friend or not? I don't know yet. - No, thank you. It'll be like a cup of coffee for a girl like you. It's not my thing anymore. Well, why don't you do it just for nostalgia's sake? - I don't need this. ' Because if you as desperate as Rubin is, and I think you are.. ...you definitely need this. So you put it this way, you want me to meet your friend? Relax...hang out. Stay a while. Yeah, where the hell have you been, Jaimie? I've been waiting for you all night. Jaimie! So how much are we talking about? Hard to tell without a blood test. But I'm guessing she is no amateur. Give her one or two when she wakes up. - Helps soften the landing. - Nick, my man. I can always count on you. Who was that? Hospitals file reports. They need ID. It's not good for us. Valium. Take one. You have any idea what Carter would do if he knew about this? It was the only way Howard would make the meet with Ty. He's meeting him today at five. There's never just one way. It's the only way I knew. So, all that stuff you told Reuben at the NA meeting the addiction to crime, your little backstory. ' - I was trying to cut into him. Carter asking you to use your real name. So, what was that? The only time you ever told the truth is when you were lying to Reuben, right So, who the hell are you? My name is not Jaimie Allan, it's Jaimie Anderson. I changed it before I joined the force. - You changed your name. - No. 'Not just my name. Everything.' Identification, social security. I changed who I was. You just became somebody else. If you'd been through what I had, you would've done the same. Who knows? Your boyfriend? No. He is a good guy. He comes from a good family, good schools, good job. Why would he want to be with someone like that? This is insane. You can't tell Carter about what happened at Howard's. Everything you've done up till now taints this case. It's better he knows now. He said he'd kick me off the force if I lied to him. I don't know what the truth is with you. I like being a cop. I need to be a cop. It's all I have. I still have to tell Carter. I'm sorry. Where the hell have you been? Where's Jaimie? You knew how screwed up she was when you brought her in? What're you talking about? You asked her to use her real name. You knew that if Howard looked into it he'd find the history of a criminal. Yes. But you never told us who she really was. I was trying to protect her. By putting Ty and me in danger. Thank you, Carter. How're we supposed to trust anything that she does? She has talent. You didn't bring her in because she is talented. You knew that somebody that bent and that-that desperate would do anything for you. When did you get so fragile? It's all about catching that bad guy. Yeah. It is. Hey, tell him the good news. Howard agreed to meet Ty at five o'clock today. She bagged him. All by the book, Carter. Get Reuben ready. Good job. Thank you for that. Why the change of heart? I don't know, Reuben. I guess you grew on me. - Not so good. 'I came clean about everything'' 'At least I got that off my chest.' - I need to talk to you. - Go ahead. We didn't flip Reuben clean. I planted drugs there and blackmailed him to cooperate. - It was entrapment. - I put everything in place. 'Ty's supposed to meet with Howard in two hours' and you're telling me this now? You lied to me. That's what I'm trying to fix. Is Reuben getting cold feet or is this your conscience talking? It's me. Reuben still wants to go through with it. - That's what we're doing. - Sure he does. - In the car. - Take him to his lawyer. I want him on tape stating that his involvement in this case 'is purely voluntary. Go.' You want anything to drink, coffee, anything? No, I'm good. I took a look into your records. Yeah, how'd you manage that? It was impressive. You've been around. Chasing that almighty dollar. You had a few years in Chino. D Well, I had a client in D-block about the same time you were in. He was an esse guy. Tattoos all over his neck. Name is Tony Waller. Guys called him T-Wall. Rings a distant bell. Well, I called him. You know, see what he said about you. And? Well, he said that, uh.. ...you were stand-up con. That you never went punk. You never backed down from the hacks. He got it right. He still looks like a bird crapped in his right eye. We both know it was his left eye. C'mon, now. We gonna do business or what? I believe we are. As soon as my quality control guy gets here, okay? Okay. Did you get it? Reuben's attorney got him on tape saying he was acting voluntarily as an informant for us. He says it'll hold up in any court. - Good. - Okay, say something. Um...hello. 'This is simple, Reuben.' You go in, test the drugs like you always do. Don't deviate from your routine. Machine's rigged? It'll give a higher, positive reading. Good. As soon as Howard makes a buy, you say, "Can I go now?" That's our signal to make the bust. And Reuben...you have to make sure that the money is there. Otherwise we don't have a case. Understood? Let's go. 'Hmm. 77%?' Reuben's machine never lies. Held up my end. Yes, you did. 'Faris will be back in a minute.' Dean, get ready. 'Oh, excuse me.' I'm right there. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. 'Right.' 'Yeah.' Something's wrong. Thank you. Reuben...that was your lawyer. Cover's blown. Go, go, go! He told me about your little, uh confessional at his office today. Maybe you forgot that I'm the one who recommended you to him during your first possession arrest. You punk! He's setting us up. Kill him! Down! On the ground! LAPD! - Ty. - I'm good. I could have stopped it. Maybe I should have, but.. ...I wanted Howard. What happened here today wasn't your fault, Jaimie. You know that, right? What do you need me for? I need you because of who you are. Not who you were.. ...and not who you pretend to be. You did good. Tomorrow you'll do better. [Jody Quine singing "Hollywood"] 'This is Scott Mueller. Leave a message and I'll call you back'' * Leaving it for * I follow it out yonder.. I thought you might have some trouble winding down. I find this helps. Reuben, you know.. This stuff happens. You just got to shake that off. What? - No. No, no, no. No, can't do that. That's yours. Put it in a box, you know, file it away, 'cause you got plenty of time to look at it later. And, look, Carter.. ...he's just rigid. He'd probably go crazy if he knew I came over here tonight. * With my new guitar So, we won't tell him. * And my name in lights * People come * And people go * They got no problem * Taking your soul * And they'll talk up your life on the boulevard * * Give you the money and the fancy cars * * And all they want from me is my soul * * But it's everything I ever wanted and more * * So I'll give it to you for a song **
