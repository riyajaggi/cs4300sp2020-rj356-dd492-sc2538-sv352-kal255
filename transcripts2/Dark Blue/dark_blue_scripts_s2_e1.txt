 WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? WELL, WE'RE TRYING TO BUST HIM FOR SELLING GUNS, RIGHT? SO WHY DON'T WE POSE AS A BUYER? WE TRIED THAT, REMEMBER? LAST YEAR? HE DOESN'T SELL TO STRANGERS. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T TRY AGAIN. LET DEAN DO HIS THING -- WORK IGGY, MAKE VICTOR FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM, AND THEN GET IN THE MIX ON THE GUN BUSINESS. PATIENCE. WHETHER IT'S GROWING TOMATOES OR BUSTING SERBIAN GANGSTERS, IT'S ALL ABOUT PATIENCE.

YEAH, WE OPENED LAST WEEK. YEAH, WELL, I HATE TO BREAK THE BAD NEWS TO YOU, BUT THIS IS A PRETTY DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE'S A LOT OF ROBBERIES, VANDALISM, AND THEFT. MY FIRM HELPS OUT IN THAT REGARD, THOUGH. IT'LL BE $100 PER WEEK. NO SPECIAL INTRODUCTORY RATES? MM, I'D HAVE TO ASK MY BOSS, ALEX. WHO'S YOUR BOSS? VICTOR? PEOPLE TALK. MM-HMM. VICTOR SELL ANYTHING BESIDES INSURANCE? LIKE WHAT? ECSTASY. NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEARD. SO, YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS HORNSBY GUY IS BETTER THAN FITZGERALD? "HORNBY" HE'S BRITISH. THEY'RE IN SOME BOOK CLUB TOGETHER. HIS BOOKS ARE GOOD. THEY'RE FUNNY, TOO. OKAY, SO HE'S FUNNY, BUT FITZGERALD'S A LEGEND. "30, THE PROMISE OF A DECADE OF LONELINESS. "A THINNING LIST OF SINGLE FRIENDS. YOU GET ANY MONEY FROM THAT TATTOO PLACE? A THINNING BRIEFCASE OF ENTHUSIASM..." NO. BUT...THE OWNER... IS LOOKING TO BUY SOME ECSTASY. SO? SO, IS VICTOR INTO THAT BUSINESS? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT, IGGY? IT'D BE A GREAT WAY TO MOVE UP THE LADDER. I MEAN, VICTOR WON'T LET US SELL GUNS. MAYBE HE'LL LET US GET IN THE MIX IN SOME -- SOME ECSTASY. THE GUY IS CLEARLY ONE OF THE PENULTIMATE WRITERS OF ALL TIME. ALL RIGHT, VICTOR. YOU WIN. AND BY THE WAY, "PENULTIMATE" MEANS "SECOND TO LAST," NOT "REALLY ULTIMATE." WHAT'S THAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY? WHAT? "PENULTIMATE." NO, YOU JUST USED IT IN THE WRONG WAY. THAT'S ALL. CORRECT ME IN PUBLIC AGAIN! HUH?! GO AHEAD! CORRECT ME AGAIN! PENULTIMATE SON OF A BITCH! WE SELL INSURANCE. LIKE I SAID, THAT'S IT. NOW, JUST SHUT UP, GO BACK, AND GET SOME MONEY. ALL RIGHT? CAN YOU DO THAT? FORGET ABOUT THE DRUGS. YEAH. THANK YOU. UH, SO, HOW MUCH YOU LOOKING FOR? 5,000 TABS. CAN YOU HANDLE THAT? YEAH. YEAH. OF COURSE. I'M GONNA NEED SOME MORE TIME. LIKE HOW LONG? UH...A COUPLE DAYS. GOT ANYTHING ON YOU NOW? WHAT, NOW? NO. NOTHING? NO. NOTHIN'. ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T? YEAH. YEAH... BACK AWAY FROM THE PHONE! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? TRYING TO JACK ME?! TAKE IT EASY, OKAY?! PUT THE GUN DOWN NOW. I SAID PUT THE GUN DOWN. OKAY. YOU PUT THAT PIECE DOWN, OR I'M GONNA BLOW HER LITTLE BRAINS OUT. LISTEN TO HIM, BILL. LISTEN TO HIM, BILL. HE'S A GOOD GUY. HE JUST GOT A LITTLE SPOOKED. LAPD! PUT THE GUNS DOWN NOW! DON'T SHOOT! PUT THE GUN DOWN! WE'RE FBI! SHOW 'EM YOUR BADGE, BILL! LET GO! WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE? YOU TELL ME. YES, WE SHOULD HAVE MADE SURE LAPD WAS UP TO DATE REGARDING OUR INVESTIGATION. BUT THE TRUTH IS, WE'VE HAD PROBLEMS IN THE PAST WITH LEAKS. LEAKS? ARE YOU SUGGESTING SOMEBODY -- I'M SUGGESTING WE SKIP THE INTERAGENCY FINGER-POINTING AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO TAKE DOWN VICTOR UROS. WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE? WELL, I PROPOSE YOU TALK TO MY BOSS. MY APOLOGIES. WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS, AGENT RICE? I THINK WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. IS THAT A POLITE WAY OF SAYING YOU'RE TAKING OVER OUR INVESTIGATION? WASN'T MEANT TO BE POLITE. DEAN'S OBVIOUSLY MADE SOME INROADS. LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT -- USE HIM TO INTRODUCE ME TO VICTOR, WE MAKE A DEAL, AND BUST HIS ASS. A DRUG DEAL? SO YOU'RE CONVINCED HE'S MOVING "X"? WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT. ONE OF MY INFORMANTS IDENTIFIED HIM AS A TOP ECSTASY SUPPLIER. HE'S NEW, BUT HE'S GETTING PRETTY BIG. OH, SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE DOWN HERE. TO CHASE A PRETTY BIG "X" DEALER. CORRECT. WELL, WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE A GUN CASE, BUT IF YOU LIKE DRUGS BETTER, WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP. IN FACT, I KNOW SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP JUMP-START YOUR INVESTIGATION. TERRIFIC. BUT I'LL HAVE TO GO UNDER AS THE BUYER. MY CONTACT DOESN'T LIKE STRANGERS. WHATEVER'S MOST EXPEDIENT. "EXPEDIENT." YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY THE FEDS MAKE THE BIG BUCKS. IN THE MEANTIME, I'LL MAINTAIN MY COVER... JUST IN CASE. AWESOME. LOOKS LIKE THIS VEGETABLE-GARDEN THING IS KIND OF WORKING. WANT TO COME OVER FOR DINNER? I CAN'T. I HAVE A DATE. CREAM? ALL I GOT'S ALMOND MILK. REALLY? VICTOR UROS. YOU EVER HEAR OF HIM? UH, NO. WORD IS HE'S MOVING LOTS OF "X". YOU WANT AN INTRODUCTION? NOT A PROBLEM. I STILL KNOW A WHOLE BUNCH OF GUYS WORKING THAT SIDE OF THE BUSINESS. WHAT NAME YOU GOING BY? JIMBO KELLY. STANDARD CONTRACT, 10% OF THE STREET VALUE. NO, NO. THIS ONE'S ON ME. ON YOU? YEAH, YEAH. I OWE YOU ONE, MAN, FOR THAT THING YOU DID FOR MY KID. AW, COME ON, MAN. THAT WAS NO BIG DEAL. HEY, LOOK, YOU DIDN'T GET THEM ASSAULT CHARGES DROPPED, RAY WOULDN'T BE IN THE MARINES. NOW, THAT'S A BIG DEAL. I'LL CALL YOU LATER ON TODAY WITH A TIME AND PLACE. HOW'S THAT? I LIKE THAT. George: NICE TO MEET YOU, JIMBO. THANKS FOR SEEING ME. FREDDY SAID IF I NEEDED SOME "X", I SHOULD TALK TO YOU AND VICTOR, SO, HERE I AM. HOW MUCH YOU LOOKING FOR? DEPENDS. ON? PRICE. WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR NEW PARTNERS. WELL, FREDDY TOLD ME IF I -- FREDDY'S COOL, BUT HE'S BEEN OUT OF THE BUSINESS A WHILE. SO WHAT AM I DOING, WASTING MY TIME? OH. JIMBO KELLY! HEY, IT'S, UH, IT'S DEAN. "C" BLOCK, PELICAN BAY. DEAN, DEAN. YEAH. HEY. HOW YOU BEEN, MAN? HOW YOU DOING? GOOD, MAN. IT'S BEEN A MINUTE, HUH? YEAH. SORRY. HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU TOO. NICE KID, THAT DEAN. I MEAN, HE'S A BIT BUT HE'S ALL RIGHT. GOOD TO MEET YOU, JIMBO. WH-- IS THAT IT? FOR NOW. I SEE IT DIDN'T TAKE YOU LONG TO GET USED TO THE WHOLE L.A. THING. WHEATGRASS, LYSINE, AND ALMOND MILK. WHEN DID ALMOND MILK TAKE OVER THE WORLD? YOU WANT A SIP? NO. STILL NO WORD FROM GEORGE? "STILL"? IT'S BEEN 24 HOURS. THAT WHAT YOU SAY WHEN A WOMAN DOESN'T RETURN YOUR CALL -- "IT'S ONLY BEEN 24 HOURS"? I DON'T DATE, BUT IF I DID, THEY'D CALL BACK. A LOT OF CONFIDENCE FOR SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T MAKE A DEAL WITH VICTOR'S MESSENGER BOY. HAVE YOU EVER DONE THIS BEFORE? DONE WHAT? MAKE AN ACTUAL BUY AND BUST. I'D BE HAPPY TO UNZIP MY PANTS, LIEUTENANT, AND SLAP MY RÃ©SUMÃ© ON THE TABLE NEXT TO YOURS AND COMPARE WHOSE IS BIGGER. REALLY? HELLO. HEY. FREDDY, I TOLD YOU NOT TO PUSH IT. OF COURSE I'M APPRECIATIVE. I JUST... THANKS, FREDDY. YOU'RE THE BEST. GOT A MEETING WITH VICTOR. WOW, YOU WERE GOOD. MY C.I. SET THE MEETING, NOT ME. AND MODEST. I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT. LIEUTENANT... THANKS FOR BEING SO PATIENT. IT'S NOT EASY TO HAVE SOMEBODY TAKE OVER YOUR INVESTIGATION. SO, HOW DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS? STAY IN THE CAR, YOU HEAR GUNSHOTS... COME INSIDE. YOU WANT A CLOCK ON IT? IS THAT AN INSULT? WHERE YOU GOING? FREDDY SET UP A MEETING WITH YOUR BUDDY VICTOR. WHEN? IN AN HOUR. NO. CAN'T BE. WHAT? VICTOR LEFT FOR VEGAS TWO HOURS AGO. FREDDY?! FREDDY! VICTOR GOT NERVOUS WHEN FREDDY CALLED TO SET UP ANOTHER MEETING. I TOLD HIM NOT TO PUSH, BUT... HE WAS A PROUD MAN. HE GOT UPSET WHEN THEY DIDN'T EXACTLY ROLL OUT THE RED CARPET FOR ME, SO... I'M SORRY. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER INFORMANTS THAT COULD HELP SET UP A MEETING? I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OUR NEXT MOVE HERE. OUR NEXT MOVE... IS TO BUST VICTOR FOR MURDER. YOU GOT ANYTHING SOLID ON HIM? NO, BUT HE OBVIOUSLY ORDERED THE HIT. WELL, THAT'S YOUR BELIEF. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? MAKING A MURDER CASE INVOLVES MORE THAN A HUNCH, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE VIC IS A CAREER FELON TURNED INFORMANT. LOOK, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, HALF OF L.A. PROBABLY WANTED THIS GUY DEAD. WHAT'S YOUR POINT? LET HOMICIDE HANDLE THE MURDER. OUR OBJECTIVE, OUR MANDATE IS TO TAKE DOWN VICTOR FOR DRUGS. IS THAT AN ORDER? IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE. WELL, DEAN... LOOKS LIKE IT'S UP TO YOU. I NEED YOU TO GET ME A FACE-TO-FACE WITH VICTOR SOON. YEAH, WELL, I MENTIONED IT TO IGGY, AND HE SHOT ME DOWN -- FAST. AND THAT WAS BEFORE VICTOR GOT ALL PARANOID AND HAD FREDDY CAPPED, SO... I DIDN'T SAY IT'D BE SIMPLE. GET IGGY TO THE TATTOO PARLOR. I'LL CHANGE HIS MIND. SORRY ABOUT FREDDY. TALK TO THE HOMICIDE GUYS? YEAH. THEY'RE INTO IT, BUT... BUT NOT REALLY. C.I.'s DON'T EXACTLY GET TOP BILLING. Yeah. EXCUSE ME! CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND, PARTNER? YOUR PLANT'S INFECTED WITH THE TOSPOVIRUS, AND WE'RE ALL PRETTY CONCERNED AROUND HERE. I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT. LITTERING WON'T HELP, EITHER. WE START SMALL -- SAY 5,000 HITS. IT GOES SMOOTH, WE'LL GO FROM THERE. PLUS, YOU CAN ADD A DIME ON THE BACK END FOR THE FIRST FIVE DEALS. LOOK, LIKE I SAID, HONEY, WE SELL INSURANCE. THEN GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. CAN WE HAVE A SECOND? Can I talk to you, Iggy? Please? I don't know if you think it's noble to be a doormat, man, but I don't. VICTOR WOULD HAVE US WHACKED IF HE FOUND OUT THAT WE WERE DEALING DRUGS. OR MAYBE HE'D BE IMPRESSED, HUH? OH, WHAT...OKAY. OKAY. HERE'S YOUR CHANCE, ACE. YOU WASH MY BACK, I WASH YOURS, OKAY? SO, THIS ACTRESS CHICK I FINALLY GOT A DATE WITH -- ACTRESS OR PORN STAR, IGGY? COME ON. SHE IS LEGIT. SHE HAS BEEN ON "ALL MY CHILDREN"... ONCE. AND ANYWAY, SHE'S GOT THIS FRIEND THAT JUST GOT DUMPED BY THIS DUDE. DOESN'T WANT TO SPEND THE NIGHT ALONE. SO, SHE'S SAYING THAT I GOTTA BRING A CUTE GUY WITH ME, OR ELSE SHE'S GONNA CANCEL. COME ON. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I PLAY YOUR WINGMAN... and you bring my proposal to Victor. Ah, yeah. I'll mention it to him, but that's it. Deal. All right, cool. OH. SOMETHING I SHOULD TELL YOU ABOUT HER FRIEND. HE'S A DUDE. SO, THEY GOT THE WHOLE HOUSE SURROUNDED, RIGHT? AND OUT COMES FREDDY. HANDS UP... BARE-ASS NAKED! YELLING, "DON'T SHOOT! THIS AIN'T A RIFLE!" YEAH. MY MAN. TO FREDDY. SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS? WE NEED TO DRAW OUT VICTOR'S TRIGGERMAN. IS THIS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M GONNA ENJOY THE HELL OUT OF IT. I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH. SO, THIS TATTOO CHICK, SHE SAYS SHE CAN HANDLE SOME HEAVY WEIGHT. HEY, UH, IF I MAY? WE SEEN THE PLACE. I MET THIS GIRL A BUNCH OF TIMES. SHE'S GOT TONS OF CONNECTIONS IN THE CLUB SCENE. THIS COULD BE HUGE BUSINESS FOR YOU. OKAY. BUT IF IT DOESN'T PAN OUT, IT'S ON YOU. THANKS. YOU WON'T REGRET IT. AND WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? YOU THINK YOU CAN KILL MY FRIEND? DISRESPECT ME? AAH! I COME TO YOU LIKE A MAN, LIKE A PROFESSIONAL, AND YOU KILL MY FRIEND? NOBODY DOES THAT TO ME! NOBODY!! SO HERE'S THE DEAL. FROM NOW ON, THIS IS MY BACKYARD. AND I GET 10% OF ANY BUSINESS YOU CONDUCT. YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO? THAT'S FOR FREDDY. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? I WANTED A FIRSTHAND DESCRIPTION OF CARTER'S JOHN WAYNE ACT. MM WELL, IT WAS... PRETTY NUTS... IN A GOOD WAY. LOOK, I'M -- I'M STARVING. I WAS GONNA COOK. YOU HUNGRY? YOU COOK? YEAH, I COOK. HELPS RELAX ME. MORE THAN SEX? GONNA GRAB SOME LO MEIN. BE BACK IN 10 MINUTES. Phil: GIVE ME THE GUN. YOU WORK FOR VICTOR? WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? PHIL. I WORK FOR VICTOR, TOO. HE SAYS YOU KNOW THE GUY WHO CRASHED HIS PLACE TODAY. YEAH, WE DID SOME TIME TOGETHER. WE NEED HIS ADDRESS. WHY? WHY DO YOU THINK? HEY, GOOD NEWS. YOUR PLAN WORKED. MANAGED TO FLUSH OUT VICTOR'S KILLER. SOME GUY NAMED PHIL. BUT THE BAD NEWS IS, HE WANTS TO KILL YOU NOW. GOOD. THAT'S GOOD? OKAY, SO TELL ME, CARTER. HOW DOES MAKING YOURSELF A TARGET HELP SOLVE FREDDY'S MURDER? I HAVE NO IDEA. I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE THESE DAYS. I AM. SO, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS PHIL GUY? HE'S VICTOR'S FRIEND, BROTHER... HIRED GUN? IS HE A PRO... OR A BELIEVER? IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE, YOU KNOW. THINK I GOT A FINGERPRINT. ON YOUR GUN? HOW'D THAT HAPPEN? I THINK WE GOT A BREAK IN THE MURDER CASE. ON YOUR INFORMANT'S MURDER? NO, THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION. WHAT DO YOU THINK? THE REASON I'M CONFUSED IS, I TOLD YOU TO LET THE HOMICIDE GUYS TAKE CARE OF THAT. WELL, THE REASON I'M CONFUSED IS THAT MURDER IS A BETTER BUST THAN DRUG DISTRIBUTION. SO WHAT AM I MISSING HERE? WHY ARE YOU SO AGAINST THIS? WHAT IS IT OR IS IT SOMETHING BIGGER, LIKE YOU DON'T REALLY GIVE A RAT'S ASS ABOUT VICTOR? I DO GIVE A RAT'S ASS, BUT HE'S NOT THE ULTIMATE TARGET. SO WHY LIE ABOUT IT? I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS RELEVANT. BECAUSE YOU WERE PLAYING US. AND THEN FREDDY GETS CLIPPED, AND YOU START TO GET REALLY NERVOUS, BECAUSE IF WE MAKE A MURDER CASE, YOUR WHOLE FANCY PLAN GOES UP IN SMOKE, RIGHT? BECAUSE PROSECUTORS DON'T GIVE IMMUNITY IN A HOMICIDE. TARGET'S NAME IS DANIEL ELSON. HE'S THE MAJOR PLAYER INVOLVED IN ORGANIZED CRIME. WE WERE INVESTIGATING HIM IN SAN FRANCISCO, BUT THEN HE DISAPPEARED. OKAY, SO HOW DOES THIS ALL TIE IN TO VICTOR? WE WERE UP ON ELSON'S CELL, AND WE PICKED UP A PHONE CALL HE MADE TO VICTOR HERE IN L.A., TWO MONTHS AGO. OKAY, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU WANT TO SELL OUT FREDDY'S MURDER SO YOU CAN IMPRESS YOUR BOSS? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME? THIS IS BUSINESS. DON'T MAKE IT PERSONAL. YOU SAID THAT VICTOR OKAYED THE DEAL WITH IGGY. SET IT UP FOR TOMORROW. HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU. [ SLAMS TABLET ON TABLE, LOADS GUN ] 10,000 HITS. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS STUFF. WHAT, ARE YOU JOKING OR SOMETHING? YOU TELL ME. WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU GUYS ARE COPS. THIS IS ENTRAPMENT. COPS?! ARE YOU SERIOUS?! YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, THEN? DEAL'S OFF. COME ON. BUT -- SHE THOUGHT WE WERE COPS. LIKE I SAID, SHE'S CRAZY! SHE'S SMART, YOU IDIOT. 10,000 HITS IS A FIVE-YEAR MINIMUM. ONE TAB LESS, AND IT'S ONLY A YEAR. SO IF SHE'S A COP, SHE'S GONNA BUST YOU. AND IF SHE'S NOT AND SHE ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING, SHE'S GONNA THINK YOU'RE COPS. IT WAS A TEST, IGGY. A TEST. THAT'S RIGHT. SHE PASSED. SET UP A MEETING WITH HER TONIGHT, IG. HEY. FIND JIMBO'S ADDRESS YET? UH, I'M WORKING ON IT. YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS, DEAN. WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE. YOU'VE COME TO APOLOGIZE. I'M IMPRESSED. I TALKED TO MY FRIEND IN SAN FRANCISCO. RUMOR HAS IT, YOU HAD ELSON IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND. BUT YOUR UNDERCOVER GOT MADE, AND ELSON TOOK OFF. PRETTY EMBARRASSING, HUH? YOU SAID THIS WAS BUSINESS. BUT IT'S NOT. IT'S PERSONAL. FOR YOU. YOUR POINT? I DON'T LIKE HYPOCRITES. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU LIKE. FOLLOW MY LEAD, OR GET OFF MY CASE. HEY. I NEED YOU GUYS TO WORK THE PERIMETER TONIGHT. I'VE GOT A MEETING WITH VICTOR. SURE. IS DEAN GONNA BE THERE? I'M ON MY OWN. OKAY, WELL, THEN, WE'LL PUT A WIRE ON YOU. I DON'T DO WIRES. OKAY, THEN A PANIC BUTTON. I'LL BE FINE. I WANT A CLOCK ON IT, ALEX. I GOT TO HAVE YOU IN AND OUT -- I DON'T NEED A CLOCK. AND I DON'T NEED A DEAD FED ON M RÃ©SUMÃ©, OKAY? SO EITHER WE PUT A CLOCK ON IT, OR YOU FIND YOURSELF A DIFFERENT BACKUP. ALL RIGHT. AN HOUR. SHE'S A REAL COWGIRL, HUH? MAYBE SHE'S JUST GOOD. Dean: SO, ANY LUCK WITH THE FINGERPRINT? Carter: NAME'S PHIL DOYLE. BORN IN 1964 IN SOUTH BOSTON. TWO PRIORS -- ASSAULT AND ARMED ROBBERY. DOESN'T SOUND SERBIAN TO ME. HE'S A PRO. SO LET'S TREAT HIM LIKE ONE. GIVE HIM THE ADDRESS TO MY OLD COVER APARTMENT AT ECHO PARK, BUT I NEED A FEW DAYS TO SET IT UP. OKAY, THEN WHAT? LET ME KNOW WHEN HE'S COMING BY, AND I'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE. YOU DON'T WANT BACKUP? YOU'RE A REAL STUBBORN PRICK SOMETIMES. I MEAN, YOU REALLY THINK THAT VICTOR'S GONNA MAKE A DEAL WITH ALEX? I DON'T KNOW. BUT SHE'S A LOT BETTER THAN YOU THINK. I WAS AFRAID OF THAT. YOU WANT ME TO SABOTAGE IT? NO. SHE'S CLEAN. HOPE YOU ENJOYED THAT. SIT DOWN. WELL, I MUST CONFESS, YOU'RE FAR MORE COMELY THAN I IMAGINED. I HEAR "TATTOO PARLOR," YOU KNOW, I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK "PULCHRITUDE." DO YOU LIKE WINE? SOMETIMES. WITH DINNER MOSTLY. TRY THIS. IT'S A BURGUNDY. BUT THAT'S REALLY JUST A FANCY NAME FOR "PINOT." NOW, THIS ONE HERE IS FROM A DIFFERENT REGION. IT'S... I THINK IT'S MORE EARTHY. I'D LOVE TO, BUT I HAVE ANOTHER MEETING. WHAT'S THE RUSH? RELAX. HANG OUT. OKAY, IT'S BEEN AN HOUR. JUST GIVE HER A CHANCE. WE PUT A CLOCK ON THIS. NO, YOU PUT A CLOCK ON THIS. YEAH, AND SHE AGREED. WHAT IF WE BUST IN THERE AND SHE HAS THE WHOLE THING UNDER CONTROL? YOU REALLY WANT TO BLOW A FEDERAL CASE FOR NOTHING? 10 MORE MINUTES, JAIMIE. THAT'S IT. SO, I'VE BEEN READING THIS... THIS NEW BOOK ON CHURCHILL. HE'S A FASCINATING CHARACTER. ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT BUSINESS OR WHAT? WHAT'S THE HARM IN A LITTLE CONVERSATION? LIKE I SAID, VICTOR, I HAVE ANOTHER MEETING. I TELL YOU WHEN TO LEAVE. GO TO HELL. WHAT DID YOU SAY? Jaimie: HOLD UP. HOLD UP. NOW IT'S BEEN AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES. WE HAVEN'T SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS. I CAME HERE TO TALK ABOUT BUSINESS -- NOT WINE, NOT HISTORY. YOU JUST KEEP JERKING ME AROUND. SO, LIKE I SAID, go to hell. TOUGH AND GORGEOUS. I LIKE IT. I'M GOING IN. DOOR. SEE YOU TOMORROW. ONE MORE THING. WHAT? I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IGGY AND DEAN. THEY'RE LITTLE BOYS. I WANT TO DEAL WITH YOU. YOU GUYS WANT TO GO GET A DRINK? HELL YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. VICTOR'S ASKING ABOUT THE DAMAGE, RUSS. SO YOU NEED TO GET THE ECHO PARK JOINT SET UP ASAP. ONE MORE THING -- I THINK ALEX'S MEETING WITH VICTOR IS GOING DOWN TODAY. FIND JIMBO'S ADDRESS YET? EASY QUESTION, DEAN. LOOK, PHIL, I-I'M NOT IN YOUR LINE OF BUSINESS. OKAY, SO I'M -- I'M JUST A LITTLE GUN-SHY ABOUT ALL THIS. VICTOR TOLD ME TO GET THE ADDRESS... OR KILL YOU INSTEAD. I'LL ASK ONE MORE TIME. BUT BEFORE YOU ANSWER, KNOW THIS. IF YOU SAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN "YES," I'M GONNA SHOOT YOU IN THE FACE. YES. GOOD ANSWER. HE LIVES IN VENICE ON ROSE. OH, NO. YOU'RE TAKING ME THERE. [ GEAR ENGAGES, CAR SHUTS OFF ] WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED SOME HELP. I DON'T. LOOK, MAN, THIS THING GOES SIDEWAYS -- STAY HERE, AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. COME ON. COME ON. COME ON, CARTER. PICK UP. COME ON, CARTER. PICK UP! HOW'S IT GOIN'? THANK GOD FOR HANDCUFFS, HUH? TRUTH IS, IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS SLIGHTLY INSANE COLOMBIAN BROAD, I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE 'EM. NOW, LOOK, PHIL. I KNOW YOU CLIPPED FREDDY. AND I KNOW VICTOR HIRED YOU TO WHACK ME. SO THE OBVIOUS THING TO DO HERE IS TO SHOOT YOU IN THE HEAD. BUT I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU. I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. IT'S A HASSLE. I MEAN, I GOT TO CHOP UP YOUR BODY. I GOT TO MOVE THE BODY. I GOT TO CLEAN UP MY LIVING ROOM. BUT IF I DON'T DO YOU, YOU'LL COME BACK TOMORROW AND DO ME. SO YOU SEE MY DILEMMA? I DON'T WANT TO KILL YOU... BUT I HAVE TO. UNLESS, PHIL, WE CAN FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. LIKE WHAT? INSTEAD OF ME KILLING YOU, HOW ABOUT I PAY YOU... TO KILL VICTOR? DONE. WELL, HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE ANY GOOD AT THIS? I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. IF YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING, I'D BE DEAD. HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU KILL? PLENTY. THAT'S NOT A NUMBER. FIVE. INCLUDING FREDDY? YEAH. ALL ON VICTOR'S NICKEL? CORRECT. I KNOW IT TAKES TIME TO WORK OUT AN IMMUNITY DEAL, BUT THREE DAYS IS TOO LONG. VICTOR NEEDS TO BE ON THE STREET IN 24 HOURS. THAT WAS THE DEAL! TAKE IT EASY. WE'LL WORK IT OUT. I'VE BEEN CHASING THIS PRICK TOO LONG TO HAVE SOME PREPPY U.S. ATTORNEY NAMED CHAD SCREW IT UP. HELLO? GOOD. SEE YOU THEN. VICTOR WILL BE HERE IN 30 MINUTES. CARTER, IT'S ME. YEAH. I GOT IT. ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU SOON. OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO ARREST VICTOR. OH, YEAH. I FORGOT TO TELL YOU. I'M A COP. WEARING A WIRE, TOO. LAPD WILL BE HERE IN ABOUT 2 MINUTES. MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME. AND DID I MENTION THAT FREDDY WAS A FRIEND OF MINE? YOU HEARD OF THIS MAGAZINE THE NEW YORKER? EVERYONE SAYS HOW GREAT IT IS, BUT I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T SEE -- BUT THE ARTICLES ARE JUST TOO DAMN LONG. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. YOU'RE NOT A COP. I'LL TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT. GO AHEAD. REACH FOR YOUR GUN. DO IT. DO ME A FAVOR. CUFF HIM. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST... FOR THE MURDER OF FREDERICK JAMES. I HOPE YOU ROT. Cop: GO! MOVE. Alex: ARE YOU CRAZY? I SAID BACK OFF THE MURDER CASE! AND I SAID GO TO HELL. LIKE I TOLD YOU, ELSON'S A PERSON OF EXTREME INTEREST TO THE BUREAU. AND TO YOU. I KNOW, YOU EXPLAINED ALL THAT. THE PROBLEM IS, YOUR FANCY PLAN MADE NO SENSE. EXCUSE ME? YOUR TARGET HE'S DEAD. VICTOR HAD HIM KILLED TWO MONTHS AGO. HIS BODY'S AT THE BOTTOM OF A QUARRY IN PALMDALE. WHO THE HELL TOLD YOU THIS? THE GUY WHO KILLED HIM. HIS NAME'S PHIL. NOT A BAD GUY FOR A HIT MAN. AND YOU BELIEVE HIM? LAPD ALREADY FOUND A BODY, SO, YEAH. I DO BELIEVE HIM. THAT MEANS YOU'VE BEEN CHASING A GHOST. AGENT RICE. YEAH. RIGHT AWAY. MY BOSS JUST FLEW IN FROM SAN FRANCISCO. WANTS TO KNOW WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TODAY. WHAT HAPPENED IS PRETTY SIMPLE. IN THE COURSE OF YOUR INVESTIGATION, YOU REALIZED THAT ELSON WAS DEAD. AS SUCH, YOU MODIFIED THE PLAN AND ORDERED MY TEAM TO HELP BUILD A MURDER CASE AGAINST VICTOR UROS. YOU'RE WILLING TO DO THAT?
