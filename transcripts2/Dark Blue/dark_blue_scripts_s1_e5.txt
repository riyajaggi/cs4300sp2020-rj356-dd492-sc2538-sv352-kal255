 The bureau is making her kidnapping a top priority. This was sent to us this morning. Why did they grab Gloria Malnik? She's just a saleswoman. We think they were going for her boss, Thomas Sheppherd. He's CEO of Triad Geno. 'Say hello, Gloria.' - Hi. Please, somebody help! - 'Shut up!' 'We've had her 11 days and you're still playin' around' 'with that ransom.' 'So maybe we start playin' around.' No! No-o-o! Aah! No!

 Give us that 2 million. We're still running the voice analysis. It's the same guys. Excuse me? Lieutenant, you've been asked to join us because of your knowledge of LA's criminal underground. This is the third abduction in the last five months.. ...and you're 0 for 3. We are pursuing multiple leads. - I'm pursuing one, too. Yeah, I do. Carter. I'm just not as effective when I have to share with the FBI. Fine. Share with me.

 - Ty is close to getting in. - Boulevard crew. The street gang? They're into kidnapping? I guess they decided to expand. Can't believe you gettin' out today. That's what happens when the only witness in your case is a damn junkie. - Look for some work. - You know, anything that pays. - Hey, Earl. What's up, man? - Get lost. - Okay. Come on, E. He stays right here. - This don't concern you. It's between me and this dead man. What's the prob-- Don't make it concern you, son. Git. I said get lost. Okay. Get the left one! Let him go. On the ground! On the ground! 'Good job, man!' Think that worked? Well, it sure as hell felt real. How much did you pay those, uh, skinheads? - A grand. Couldn't tell 'em. They talk. Thanks. Earl owes you now. Work him. Not as easy as it looks, Carter. He's OG. Boulevard crew. Two months ago, he was shooting his mouth off to a confidential informant about all the money he was gonna make kidnapping rich white people. But he shot a dude over a parking spot and ended up here. Don't make your week in jail a waste of my time, Ty. You act like I'm enjoying this. I'm acting like I need a name. Carter. These security guards, they don't know anything. They were driving Sheppherd's limo. If it were an inside job they woulda gotten the guy. That them? Like I said, they don't know anything. - Stop pushing it. Come on. Hey. Good. I'm on my way. - Ty just got sprung. - See you at home. It sounds delicious. Just put it in the freezer babe. Okay, bye. Cooks for you too, huh? - Oh! There he is. - Don't worry. I'm not gonna ask about the shower. Hah! Not even close. - Well, welcome back. - Thank you. Here's the info on the guy you wanted. Bobby Kilgore, 28. Pretty much raised by the Boulevard Crew. Assaults, assault, petty larceny-- Our man in prison said this guy Bobby is into kidnapping now? Said he's in to "people business." How'd three strikes miss this guy? - Pay him a visit, Ty. Don't think you'll blend in that neighborhood. - I'm on it. Just got to stop by the house first. - Just got out of jail. I was hoping I'd go see the wife. I'm kinda hoping we find the kidnapped lady before they kill her. He doesn't need backup. Go. I'll go. Yo, little mama! - He ain't around. You sure? I will let this dog go, mister. He's undefeated. - Tell him Ty Parker came by. Earl called me about you. Go around side. - And then the hacks jumped in. - Yeah. It got kind of ugly, but pretty much took care of business, you know. Earl appreciates that. He don't appreciate much. He cool, fellas. He cool. That's good to know about your man, Earl. He's a good dude. Tell me something, Ty. You ever bang? Nah, man. No banging for me. I was a military brat. I lived on bases, mostly. Bangin' ain't no way to make a living. Not as an adult, anyway. So, you got something better for me? - Maybe. - Bobby. Yo, Dante. This is Ty Parker. He-he was in the bucket with Earl. Why don't you go out and get us some Alfredo's? - Earl said that, uh-- - I don't care what Earl said. Earl was dumb enough to pop somebody in broad daylight and get busted. We got to be smarter than that right? - Right. Right. - Then go. So why are you here, Ty parker? Looking for a job. I heard that Bobby could hook it up. Well, you heard it wrong. I make the personnel decisions. Bobby, he my right hand. He tough. He loyal, obedient.. ...like that pit you might have seen outside. Okay, cool. So, what about you, then? What about me? I got skills, for someone in the business that pays. Well, my business is none of your business. I don't want you to get the wrong idea but Earl, he just told me what y'all-what y'all do. Excuse me? He said you was in the "people business." - Yeah. Kidnapping. I don't know what you heard, but you heard wrong. You got me? I don't want to see your pretty little face around here again. If anybody ever comes around here asking questions I'll know who sent 'em...Ty Parker. - It's cool, man. - Yeah. I'm out. They're definitely involved. Probably why I almost got shot. No! Do more! Get the money!' I'm sorry. I've done everything I can, Ted. No.. - The husband. Just found out the CEO won't pay his wife's ransom. Their kidnapping insurance only extends to senior executives. Can't the company just pay? It's worth like $2 billion. The board says it's a breach of fiduciary duty to shareholders. So now what? So, now the FBI starts conducting raids. - Hope they get lucky. - Raids are a bad idea. All victims have been held in the same place. But you don't know where that place is. - We have a few solid leads. - You start conducting raids. And the kidnappers know you're not paying. We're not paying. There's no money. At this point, her chances for survival are going down hourly. What if I have a guy on the inside? - Yes. Tell the kidnappers that the board is still considering the ransom, talking to the insurance company, whatever. Give me 48 hours. I hope your man is good. I'm not even close to being in with these guys. I know. I know. You lied to the FBI. They were gonna get her killed. - And involved me. As far as you know, he's in. Lying to the Feds. It's a bad career move. Wouldn't be my first, right? 'Say hello, Gloria.' - 'Hi. Please, somebody help! - Shut up!' 'We've had her 11 days, and you're still' 'playing around with that ransom.' 'So maybe we start playin' around.' 'No! No-o-o! Aah! No!' 'Get us that $2 million.' Dean. 6:30. I'll be in the office in half-hour. Call Ty and Jaimie. Meet me there. 'Here, according to this, you've worked at 'Stinson Security for three years'' Protecting rich people. Ty is gonna tell Dante and Bobby about how you're an army buddy, how you've access to the wealthy people. People that kidnappers would love to grab. Then they're gonna fall head over heels for me. - And tell us where Gloria is. - And it has to happen today. I ju-just got out of prison. I'm not backstopped. Dunno where I'm stayin'. Dunno what I'm driving. You're staying at Three Palms Motel on La Brea. The car you bought for $600 is waiting for you in the garage. Come on. Let's go. When does he do all this? Uh...looks like 2:38 this morning. He's sleeping here. Saw some stubble in the sink. He shaves? Carter...you read Dante's jacket? One of the founders of the Boulevard Crew. Career thug. You ever try to get in with those cats? Yeah. Can get real tricky, man. They keep her chained to the floor, Ty. I saw the ransom video. This is really pissing you off, huh? Not a big fan of kidnappers. I meant the FBI. Look, if this is about you finding this lady first. - To shove it in the Feds face. I know what happened in Lawndale. I'd want to stick it to them, if they let one of my men die but I wouldn't risk another one in the process. There's no registration or insurance so don't get pulled over. - Gonna get some food. Alfredo's? I got the lift. I'll give you a ride. - I'm gonna walk it out. - Alright, walk it out with you. So this dude Dean.. ...we was second infantry unit together in Afghanistan. He a pretty hard-Core cat. Anyway, he gets paid a lot of money to protect rich people. So? He's ready to deliver these rich individuals on a silver platter to us. Why you telling me this? I just got out of the joint, Bobby. I figure I ain't really got the infrastructure to get it popping like you and Dante do. For what? For kidnapping, man. I don't know. Look, I ain't trying to get you to fall out of your lane but what I'm offering, I think your boy Dante would like a lot. What's happening with this? You ridin' dirty? Uh-huh. You know, I never really had a real car. Me either. But I figure when I come up, it's a black Lexus for me. - Nice. Nice. Mm-Hmm. - Old school, baby. Caddy. Oh, that's hot. You gonna get your old-school Caddy.. ...convertible. You talk to Dante. Tell him what I got, he'll like. I can prove it to him, if he wants. Ty sold it. Here's the address. You're a rich lady in the backseat. Look the part. I should get out and flash a little bling? No, it's real if she stays in the car. - We're selling access. - Stay in the car. I'll be watching. - He listens to you, Dean. So, when you say things like I won't "blend" or "stay in the car", he listens. It's because you won't blend and you should stay in the car. Pull into Fresno in time for the game. Hey. 'What's that guy doing?' Hey, buddy. - Get the hell out of here. - I don't think so. - I'm a cop. Brother, you don't look like a cop. Where's your badge? Let me get that for you. - Here it is. Get down! - Whoa! Now! Don't move. - We don't want any trouble. - Shut up. That rig's got run-flat tires...bullet-proof glass.. ...of course, it don't matter if somebody unlocks the door. - Um, I don't know. Today? Some rich bitch on her way to LAX. Yeah? She famous? Nah. Her name's...Burian or Burion or something like that. Gold digger.. ...married some old real-estate developer. Dean takes her to the airport sometimes so she can fly around and spend his money. Says the cat's worth, like, 500 mil. - We don't want any trouble. - Shut up. Shut up. - Maybe we take her now. Yeah, old man, young piece of ass. He'll pay. - Let's do this, Bobby. - Yo, yo, yo, wait, man! - Wait! That's stupid. Not if your boy's driving the limo. She's right there. Let's just grab her. That's why not. Security camera. Come on, Dante, you got to think, man. Be smart. We're gonna do this, We need to plan right. We got all week to make this thing happen, my man, come on. - Alright. Alright. Alright, cool. We'll talk about it. We'll talk about it. All right, get lost. Come on, get up. Get up. You really a cop? You know, that was like amateur hour today. Almost getting made on the security camera. Yeah, I didn't see the camera either, D. - Of course you wouldn't. - Come on, man. Wish you would step out in front on something, just once. Okay, look here. If the three of us are gonna do business together. We all got to be more careful. We got to be smarter. We got to take our time, come up with a good plan. Look, we know what we're doing, alright? Trust me. We copied the whole thing from the Cartels. From the ransom, the grabs, the safe house, everything. We copied it just like they do it. I don't exactly see the fruits of your labor around here. We gotta be careful. You can't be too flashy in this hood. Dante building a big old house in-- Bobby! He ain't got to know everything! Actually, I do, Dante. Kidnapping is serious. If I'm gettin' involved with Dean. with my man,I need to know how you do things, how you make your moves, where you keep your people. - No. No. Can't do that. 'Cause we got merchandise there right now. That's why not. Inventory? Who? Let me know 'cause maybe I could help. Wish you could. We're supposed to be stacking paper right now. But somebody done grabbed the wrong person. - Not my fault, D. We tried to scare her company into paying. They just called. It's not happening. So you gonna let her go? 'Cause right now, she just costin' room and board. Not for long. Look, I'm a businessman. I gotta maximize my assets, send a message. I'm gonna squeeze that little lemon into lemonade. Bad guy's just told me they're gonna kill her. Sent a message that they mean business. Lieutenant.. Not just kill her, behead her. - Like the Cartels do. - You need to back off. 'Cause you told them the board wasn't gonna pay the ransom. - I never told them that! - I did. It's a solid negotiating technique. Remove the possibility of a victory, nothing to negotiate. Solid negotiating technique? You think we're in a board room? No. You think that, that she's a deal? Here's the deal. Here name is Gloria Malnik. She is a wife and a mother and you may have just killed her. - Excuse me. What about five, ten million dollars a year. 'Let's just end this thing. Save her.' Write the ransom check. Two million, and this thing is over. - Carter. - Yeah, I thought so. - Carter! In my office. What the hell was that? That idiot is playing Wall Street with Gloria's life. - He is not the criminal here. Did you hold two civilians at gun point today? They almost blew my cover. - They called in your plate. - So arrest me. If I have to. What was the deal when we first started this? - I catch people for you. And you're okay with it because I do things no one else will. And you don't lose your mind in the process. Give me a break. ' - To get someone kidnapped. Jamie and I will pose as Mr. and Mrs. Robert La Porte. He's a banker who lives half the year in Mexico City. Has kidnapping and ransom insurance. The perfect target. - At home in Santa Barbara. Okay, when the kidnappers google 'em they look like this. We sell this well enough they'll have no reason to google it. Make this good as you can in 20 minutes. Ready? Let's do it. Alright. Say cheese. Carter, you're a rich man. Smile. Come on. Nice, nice, nice. We're hopin' kidnappers take Jamie to same spot as Gloria? The previous victims all described the same place. So, is Jamie wearing a transponder? Too risky. They might find it. Good. How are we supposed to track her They won't lead us where there's a helicopter. - You're gonna track her. Yes. You're gonna get in the car and take a ride with her. This is ridiculous. Why is everything a fight with you, Ty I hate it when mummy and daddy fight. They'll go back to normal once we rescue the girl. Carter know that woman or something? Nah, it's not her. I-I don't know. It's like three years ago. This Russian gang kidnapped this young mother and we could have gone in for her but we got talked into waiting by her father. And Carter knew it was a bad move and, and it was. By the time we decided to go in, you know.. ...they killed her. You think he's trying to redeem himself? You got a better idea? Yeah. Carter is a fixer. - He need projects. He needs to save people. Look at us. Speak for yourself. Yeah, man. I mean, she's perfect, you know. The husband's company always has them in Mexico. Big 'K' and 'R' policy. Thing is if we don't hit them today. They're gone for like six months. So let's hit 'em. - Let me see the file. - Bam. Hey, shorty. You know what I'm saying? Rich guy, trophy wife.. Yeah. This mare could be nice. What do you mean? I'm just saying, it'll be a waste to have this apple and not take a bite. - Man, I don't know about that. It's not like she's gonna escape while we having fun with her. As long she's still breathing, we get paid. - We gotta pull the plug. These guys are bad news. - They're all bad news. - Nah, this is different. It's one thing for Jamie to go under as a criminal. It's another to go under as a victim. She knew what she signed up for. This isn't the girl scouts. But they saw her picture. They're talking rape. They won't get the chance. You'll be there. - So this is on me. - I trust you. You trust me? You don't need to trust me. You're back here. Jamie needs to trust me. Because she doesn't have a transponder nor a decent cover. I am trying to save someone's life. We don't even know if the woman is still alive. - That's no reason to stop. - It's what we do. No. It's what we do! - Two hours. Tell Dante, the insurance policy only covers Robert La Porte. Wait. You're kidnapping me. You didn't say anything to him? - No. Why do you think this is my doing? Ever since I got back with Scott-- Oh, please. Don't flatter yourself, honey, okay? In case you haven't noticed, I'm not flattered, I'm pissed. Let's go. Stay here, near a radio. Come on. Hey, his choice. Not mine. You got any jumper cables I can borrow? No, nothing. Don't talk. 'Get off me!' 'Get under the car. Get under.' Not in. Get under! 'Spell your name.' - Spell you name. - Dean. - 'I can't hear you! Louder!' - D-E-A-N. Yo, Bobby! Let me in! Let me in! Drive, Bobby! Let's go! Lemme in. Lemme in. 'Get out. Get out.' Lock him up. Where are you taking me? You got the wrong man. 'Get your hands of me!' No, please. No! - Sit. - No! Get off me! 'There you go right there. Just hold him down.' 'Got his hands?' Hello? Hello. Who are you? My name is Robert. Rob-Robert La Porte. Were you kidnapped? Yes. Who are you? I'm Gloria...Malnik. 'Yo.' Hey, what's up man? It's all good. Yeah, well, you know what? That was messed up before. Chill man. Dante just didn't want to clutter things up. You're getting your dough. Trust me. Yeah, well, I guess I have to, right? So, um, how's the merchandise? ' - Yeah. - It's not too bad here. 'Okay, well, will my car make it through?' 'Will your car make it?' What are we watching on local news 'Are you really trying figure out where we are?' Look here homie, I'm just trying to figure out whether I'm getting screwed, alright? Well, you're going to get paid. Relax. ' - No. I called to tell you that Dean went to talk to the wife and he's convinced her not to go to the cops. 'So, you should probably talk to her and soon.' I think, we can make this happen pretty fast. 'Alright. Later.' 'I just hope they're eating right.' - I'm sure they are. - I don't know. Ted's not much of a cook. He eats sausages. You know, like the precooked ones. He eats them cold. I gave up on trying to get him to stop doing that. And Ethan, my oldest.. ...he made a traveling soccer team this year. Gloria.. Are you okay? Why did they kidnap me? We're not rich. I just miss my family so much. And I got into this argument with my husband. It was bad. - Everyday I-- - Ah, don't. Don't worry about it. Marriage is.. Marriage is hard. Don't beat yourself up. Are you married? Yes. It's great, isn't it? Sure is. - Call your wife. - I wanna call my husband. It's pointless...unless he came into two million dollars. Listen to me, please. I promise-- Shut up, lady. Enough phone calls for you. You're done. - 'Hey.' You okay? Yes. Yeah, I'm fine. And if you want him to stay fine, you gotta listen up. ' - Yeah. 'Write these numbers down.' 'M86-603-412-1702.' That's your new bank account at Banco Popular. 'You'll deposit two million into that account.' 'One of my people will withdraw that money.' When that money is safe, we'll release your husband. ' - Let me talk to him. 'Okay, but you say anything stupid' then this becomes another senseless killing. - 'Hey, sweetheart.' Yeah. You know where you are? Are they feeding you? Call Marcus Harris. His number's in the green book. Ask him to get into kidnapping and ransom insurance but don't call the police. 'Okay.' And tell Marcus not to pay a red cent, until I say so. Why the hell did you do that? 'Cause I'm trying to save my life. Homes, you've done a bad job. I'm not paying you a dime, until you release Gloria. She can't pay the ransom, there's no reason to keep her. Unless you're gonna kill her. That makes you a murderer, not a businessman. I'm not paying somebody two million dollars to kill me. I promise you that. You want two million dollars from her and from me, right? Let her go, and I'll get you the money. Why? I have insurance. It won't cost me a penny. Let her go, and you'll get your money. I promise you. When? My insurance company can have it in a day. And if they don't. Then kill me.. ...and you'll get nothing. 'She's a little dehydrated, but she's basically okay.' 'So we can talk to her?' What about? Mr. La Porte? It's Carter, isn't it? Okay, go ahead. Gloria.. ...we're friends with the man who helped you escape. Mr. La Porte? Are you with his company? He said his company will pay four million dollars. I know. Look, Gloria, when they released you did you see anything, or.. I was in the trunk of a car. No sounds Glo! Teddy! Ted! He threw the Hail Mary, didn't he? He got Gloria released. It's a gutsy move. Yeah, but the clocks ticking. What do we do? Where are we going to find four million dollars? - I tried to get in that car. - I know, it's not your fault. Dante kept saying, "Go! Go!" And stupid Bobby does whatever he says. - It's not your fault. Yeah, he's terrified of Dante. How well you guys know Captain Maynard? 'I'm pleased to report that in a joint LAPD and FBI effort' 'we were able to successfully negotiate' 'the release of kidnapping victim, Mrs. Gloria Malnik.' 'According to her doctors, she suffered no serious injury'' 'And is expected to make a full recovery.' 'Mr. Thomas Sheppherd of the Triad Geno Corporation' 'would like to say a few words.' 'Frankly, it's just a blessing' 'Triad Geno had the ability to pay the ransom.' 'We're happy to come up with the two million dollars..' Okay. Let's see if it'll work. Thanks for backing me up on this. I thought it was a good idea. That's the only reason. Right. Hey. 'Hey, yo, Bobby, yo. My main man.' I just called you, because you came up with the two mil 'for the other piece of merchandise.' - Turn on the TV. The lady's company paid two million dollars for her. They didn't pay jack. We let her go and made another deal. Well, somebody came up with another deal, brother. According to the news and the CEO, they paid. ' Okay, well, I wanna know. So call him. He's touchy about the phones nowadays. 'I shouldn't even be talking to you.' Actually, you should be talking to me. 'First, I get kicked out of the van. Not cool.' Now I'm hearing Dante is getting paid. And you nothing about it. Not cool again. I'm getting nervous here, man. Where are you? - At home. ' - I don't know. - Come on, Bobby. Damn it. 'You got to know, man. You're smarter than that.' 'Dante is getting two million dollars for this woman.' That's a lot of money, Bobby. And you know nothing about it. 'What if this happens again'' We need to protect ourselves, okay? That guy is our money. 'So move him atleast, so we can keep him under our control' 'until we sort all of this out'' - No, I know. I'm coming to pick you up right now. Yo, B, you sure Dante's in here? I ain't see his Caddy. Oh, so it's Dante who's got the big Caddy, huh? Some of us get to be real flashy. Did you see that he wore a mask through the whole grab? Yeah, I saw that. I didn't wear a mask through the grab. That's 'cause you're stupid. Drop the gun. Drop the gun. What the hell is this about? What the hell you'll doing here? - I'm protecting myself. - From you rippin' me off. I'm protecting myself. So, that's the plan, huh? You get in with Bobby, hustle me? Police! Freeze! Get up! - I'm going to be leaving now. - No, you're not going anywhere. Oh, yeah? Unless you want his brains all over these walls you're gonna let me go. Cover me. Cover me. Dean, take a shot. Dean, take the shot. I don't have the shot with this thing, Ty. Come on, man, take the shot! Carter, you okay? Carter, are you okay? Yeah. - Hey, nice move. Hey, you got her back this time. So, Carter, what do you say, you call the FBI let them know how the pros do it? - Not really. You can call. Shouldn't you be home with the wife? Yeah. Thanks for the press conference. So, I figured it out. Figured what out? Why you've been such an unholy prick? Yeah. Why should today be any different? It's your birthday. Yeah.
