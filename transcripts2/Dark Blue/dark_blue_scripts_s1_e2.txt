 Step up. Geez. Next time, just send a picture. Uh-huh. Wow. I told you, I wasn't playing, G. Name is Ray. Ray. Serial numbers? Clean as a whistle. Which makes no sense, if you think about it. Whistles are nasty. Coaches blowing into them. Spreading germs everywhere.

 I'm assuming these haven't been used, right? Suicide bomber's dream. Well, they sure as hell look great. 'Just make sure they work great.' - Nice piece. - Yeah. - Start with MP-5's. - Can't wait to start shooting. Uh, I prefer to shoot myself. And I prefer to be naked with Giselle in Fiji. But I'm not, okay? Hey, Jinxy. Start running. I wanna show Ray how good this works. - Come on, man. - I'm serious. Come on, man. Start running. Or I could just start shoot your lying ass right here.

 That-that thing last month with the Bretta's-- Shh. Start running. This thing's accurate up to a 165 yards. Do some zigzags for me. - I don't have a choice. He's a thief. Adios, Jinxy. Do it on your own dime. I'm a business man, Moosa. My business don't involve me shooting punks named Jinxy. Not for free, anyway. I was just playing. Go get his dumb ass. Tell him I was kidding, alright? After testing the guns, we go to the club. We'll have some cocktails. Does that sound like a plan? - If Boyd is there. Five point six pounds. 700 rounds a minute. 30 rounds attachable box magazines. The world's second most efficient killing machine. I'm number one. Oh. - She's cute. - No doubt. Me, I like a more conventional beauty. See that one over there? Looking like a supermodel. That's my girlfriend. Taylor! How about you? Got a girlfriend? - I'm single. There ain't nothing wrong with that. So where's your boy, um.. Jinxy? He's still pissed off about this afternoon. Some people can't take a joke. - I'm good. 'These girls are making me dizzy.' Our job is to watch. You're new to this. I get it. Trust me. What I don't get is when Carter says that we can't tell anybody about what we do, does he mean anybody? Yeah, he means anyone. Not your-your mother your shrink or your friends from the academy or even your dog. Anybody means anyone. You wanna dance, handsome? Not right now, baby. Thank you. O-oh. Strong and handsome. I like that. Hey. Strong and handsome. I like that? - Not now. - Hey, listen. Just ask once. Okay? If the man says no, you walk away. You don't have to flirt. I said you don't need to flirt. You hear me? I love you, sweetie. Hey, Bill. How you doing, man? ' - Yeah. - We got a problem. Big guy, canvas jacket. Right behind me at the bar. Ty did business with him last month under the name of Phil Gamble. 'Could blow Ty's cover.' Handle him. I'm on. Now, get a cab home. Asshole. What the hell are you thinking? Sorry, it was an accident. Grab that prick. He's popped. 'Get your damned hands off me.' 'Do you know who I am? I'm gonna have you killed.' Jimmy. This is Ray Hamilton. This is the guy I was telling you about. - Ray. - Jimmy. Hear you guys had a productive meeting today. Merchandise looks good. I think, it's time we talked numbers. Hello? 'Like I said, it's not a problem.' Now? Okay. Son of a bitch. I'll be back in five minutes. Take care of my friend Ray. - Yeah, I'm getting close. - Call when you get to motel. Next time I'll get you in the Four Seasons. I'm serious, Carter. A few more days, you'll be home with Melissa hanging out in the backyard, sipping chardonnay. I'll be back home, but not in the backyard. I can promise you that. - Hey. - Hey, sweetie. - Yeah, of course. Is the case over? Not yet. We're just working out some.. 'Working out some minor details.' - Because I love you, woman. I love you too. Hang up. You're making me scared. I love you. Bye, bye, bye. Ray. You ready to talk? 120. You're kidding. A hundred and twenty thousand? That's kind of steep. The market value for 20 A.K's, 15 MP-5's and 10 Barretts is 47 max. Now, based on the quality of your merch I'll pay a premium. But I can't go up to a 120. The number is still 120. Hey, you know what? It's been nice to meet you, Jimmy. How does 105 sound? Best I can do is a 100. When can we close? Don't worry about the money. What else is there to worry about? The cash is not a problem. You got my word on that. Deal. I'm only gonna say this once. You're straight with me, I'm straight with you. You're not.. '...you're dead.' Good knowing you, Jinx. Oops. Come by tomorrow morning around ten. We'll go for the fine print. There's a girl waiting for you upstairs. - My treat. - I appreciate that. I'm gonna pass. Head back to the motel. Let me get some shut-eye. Suit yourself. Happy birthday. What are you doing here? Go back to sleep. You're so responsible. Somebody in our family has to be. So, is the case closed? Almost. Just gotta cross some T's. - Baby-- What are you doing? Does Carter know you're here? Stop worrying. Come here, woman. It's fine, alright? Lay back. This won't take long. No. I can't, I can't. Besides, I don't like having sex with you while you're under. You sort of...feel like a stranger to me. Sounds sexy. Not to me. You know when I'm with you, I'm with you a 100%, Ty. You're just saying that 'cause you're horny. No. I'm just saying that, because I love you. Happy birthday, baby. It's beautiful. Okay. But bracelet or no bracelet, I have to go to work. What's up, Pete? You wanted to see me? Why are you lying to us, Ray? Excuse me? Last night. You said you were going back to your motel. You didn't mention anything about 2173 Alice Street. Come on, Moosa, man. Sit down, Ray. Ray, sit down. I followed you last night, G. And you did. You went back to the motel. You went inside. You snuck out the back, you walked across the street through another parking lot and got on a motorcycle and you rode out to Pasadena. And then you spent the night with some chick. So? So, why all the wheeling and dealing? Come on, Moosa. Called taking a shower and getting laid, man. I thought that you were tired. I got a second wind. Felt like tapping some ass. Ah, there's nothing wrong with that, G. She's.. 'She's hot.' I mean, she's not my type. But she's.. Hot. - You said you were single. I am. But your friend is married. I saw the ring on her finger this morning right before she left for work. 'She was looking all rosy and smiley' like she had just gotten it so good. Well, she did. From me. Not her punk ass banker husband. The married bitches. So appreciative, it's unfair. True that, Ray. But the married bitches, don't usually give the house keys to their little boy-toys. Says who? Says me. You're tripping, Moosa. You're tripping. I hope so, Ray. For your sake. I'm gonna need that 100 grand by Friday. The deal was to close next week. It went better than I thought. Well, just keep me in the loop. I always do. Chief's planning to announce L.A.P.D's war on guns next month. 'If you think this bust is coming down on Friday' I might suggest he push up the press conference. I'm a better cop than politician. That might be the most accurate thing you've ever said. - Hey. - 'Carter, it's me.' He was supposed to make contact in 30 minutes. It's been 38. Wait a sec. God damn it. 'What is it, Jamie? What?' I tried to follow, but they had a head start. - No, someone was next to him. Ty got there in time. You covered the door till 10:38 Then Moosa drove away with Ty at the back. - I only have two eyes. - We're trying to figure out. - No one's blaming you. - Doesn't sound like that. I don't get it. Last night, everything went perfect. He left the club around 11. Went back to his motel-- That he went back to his motel. You know something that I don't? It's Melissa's birthday. This ain't his first rodeo. You know Ty. He wants it all. He thinks he can bounce back and forth 'between UC guy and suburban husband guy'' Without paying the vig. Where did you meet this rug? Again. At a club in Hollywood. She lives in Pasadena. - Don't know if you've heard. There's this little invention that's called an automobile. Is that supposed to be funny? He's right, Johnny. It's a stupid question. That's not the point, is it? The point is, are you lying? Again, she's just a married freak I bone when her husband is out of town. Run her address and license. Pete, go get our little friend. Hello? I'm trying. I didn't say I needed more time. I said I'm trying. A late fee? Are you kidding me? 'I..uh.' Told you what happens to liars, right? Ever take a polygraph exam, Ray? Are you a human being or an alien? Answer the question. Johnny. 'Answer'' 'Answer, or you're a dead man.' Human...being. There we go. Do you intend to answer these questions truthfully? - Yes Yes. - Ray Hamilton. You married? No. - No. You a cop? No. Do you have access to $100,000? Yup. Want to screw Johnny's girlfriend? That's not funny? No, she's not my type. Happy birthday. It's a stupid cop rule. If someone's under cover and it's his wife's birthday it's the commanding officer's job to deliver flowers. Why are you really here? I was gonna get you a card, but.. I haven't seen Ty in two weeks. That's why you're here, right? Check up on him, make sure he's a loyal soldier. I hope you like the flowers. Good news is, you didn't fail. - Bad news is, you didn't pass. That means, I'm still debating on whether or not to shoot you. Larry here, thinks it's 50:50 you're lying. I think it's more like 60:40. But...since I got a liquidity issue I'm gonna give you a chance to close the deal and save your life. But there's a new deadline. Ten o clock tonight. You expect me to run to the ATM and withdraw that amount of cash by ten'o clock, tonight? If you are who you say you are. Ray Hamilton Bag man for the Sinaloan Cowboys. Then it's doable. If you're not, if you're a thief or a cop or an unemployed circus clown looking for a thrill then you can't and I have my answer. You want the deal closed, let's do. I gotta get in the streets. I gotta shake and break. I got talk to people. No. You're not going anywhere, Ray. Well, can I use a phone? You expect me to use my magical powers? That's up to you. If I don't have a 100K, in my pocket by 10'o clock tonight you're cracking jokes in hell with Jinxy. Found a gentleman's club in Palmsdale owned by an LLC Boyd controls. But the place burned down three months ago. He's also the treasurer of a "production" company called Intimate Media Inc. No business address, no phone numbers. Get ready. You in? In. Hello. It's me, man, Ray. Hey, buddy, how you doin'? 'I'm good, I'm real good'. I've tried calling you earlier, but it just kept ringing. Yeah, I know, I've been busy. Look, it's all good. I met with those cats, I was telling. It's all good, only thing is, they wanna close by tonight. We were supposed to do at the end of the week. 'I know, truth is, they told me last week' 'if I like, I gotta pull the trigger within 24 hours.' 'I sort of forgot that part, so I apologize' - The merch is perfect. - Then let's rock and roll. - 'Pretty.' You got a number I can get you back at? Look, here, buddy. I gotta bounce around, so.. ...I'll hit you back in couple of hours. Okay, cool. No.. - Prepaid phone. - I guess so. Maybe, he's just accelerating things in case they skip town or something. All good is Ty's code for all bad. He does not ring that bell lightly. He doesn't ring that bell ever. - Doing fund raising. A $100,000 by ten o'clock, are you serious? You know how the system works. I'm not looking for a sermon on bureaucratic inefficiency. I just need the money. That's the best I can do right now. Talk to the chief about pushing up his press conference, right? This has nothing to do with the press conference. It's about procedure. You gonna leave him flapping in the wind. How am I supposed to get a $100,000 by the end of the day for a unit that doesn't technically exist. - I'll find the money myself. Doesn't really matter, does it? Since I don't technically exist. I need an ounce of high grade coke. I don' t care how you get it, just get it. Leak word that Vince Peluso has five keys of top-shelf blow. He needs to move immediately. 20k a piece, non negotiable. - Me. Got it. The goal is to sell five kilos of high grade coke? Five keys of high grade baby laxative the only real coke will be the ounce that Dean gets. We'll use that to hook the buyer. Might be easier to rob a bank. If it was, we would. Believe me. Told you, stuff's good. Blue don't mean it's good, it just means it ain't bad. I wanna repeat business. I ain't selling crap. The guy I represent, he wants a new supplier but he's only looking for a product, so.. - A key a month. Boy don't like this. He don't know a damn thing. - 1500. Police, don't move, don't move. Hands over your head. Don't move. hands in the air, now. Do it, now. What the hell is wrong with you? 'Why didn't you tell me you were gonna do that?' - Sorry. Look, we got the drugs, we didn't blow our cover. And there's no paper work to fill out. Everybody wins, right? You should've told me you're gonna do that. How could I tell you something that I didn't know I was about to do? - Some guy named Jack Woods. Jaimie's contact made the introduction. 'What do we know about him?' Not much, got a drink with him in Hollywood. He's anxious to make a big score. Alright, give me the real stuff. Damn, you look good. How you doin, girl? How you doin', Dino? Come on in. Ah, this is my friend Jack. My partner, Vince. - Hey, baby. Come here, Jack. Time to get fresh. Clean. I hear you are looking for five keys. - At least. Oh-oh, we got ourselves a baller here. What can I say? Tired of running with J.V. team. Price for playing with varsity is 20 grand a key. No problem. So, tell me, where you getting the cash? I don't ask where you get the blow. You don't ask where I get the cash. - Get out. We're done. No, man, he's cool. He's just talking. Talking or wasting my time. I got a partner, he owns a few clubs around town. Makes book on the side. He's fronting the cash. See. That wasn't so hard now, was it? I guess not. I'll be back in an hour with the cash. That doesn't bother you? Screwing married chicks. Not in the least bit. The poor guy goes away on business. He thinks that his wife is in love with him. And then there you are in his bed, hitting it. That's his problem. If I ever caught someone with my Taylor.. You know, the truth is, it ain't easy dating somebody that beautiful. A woman like that gets so much attention. She's got so many options. I mean, any night of the week. She'd go home with ten different guys. All of them are gonna be rich and good looking driving fancy cars. Sometimes, I just.. It's in my head, man. I just wonder. Wonder what? - I wonder. - Oh-h! Okay, when you, when you, tell this girl you love her, right? - Yeah. Sometimes she says, I love you too. There you go. But then other times, she says nothing, she just sits there. And she looks at me and then I try to ask her you know, what's wrong? She tells me she has intimacy issues. Intimacy issues, break up with her already. Maybe, we just need to go to couples therapy or something. Time to call your partner. What the hell are you thinking? Hey, hey. Ty. Hey, buddy, what's going on? What's up? We still good for tonight? Absolutely. I am driving to my private bank right now. And should have the cash in a couple of hours. So, when I get the cash what's the best number to reach you at? Call me at 818-555-0198. 0198. Okay, perfect. I'll give you a ring then. Alright, later. Truth is, I am rooting for you. It's really good to know, Boyd. I'm serious, I need a 100k right now a lot more than I need a dead body. My contact swears he's credible. For a lifelong criminal, anyway. Who's your contact? Guy, I sort of know, Chris. Used to be heavy in the drug scene. Guy, I sort of know or friend? Used to be a friend. Now he's just a guy I sort of know. If you have a problem with my past-- A problem? Jaimie, that's why I hired you. You got lost or something? I had a hard time tracking down my boy, that's all. Mr. Vince. Is that it? Make me one of those, Jaimie. Straight up. Have a seat, my man. - I can almost smell that money. - Yeah. We need the money, not a corpse. Like I said, it was a drug buy gone bad and my man took him down. Now, with all due respect, captain. I don' t have the patience to be cross examined. I just wanna say, I am sorry. I had no idea he-he was.. What Be a thief? We can check out where's Moosa, but they're still criminals. I know. I-I just feel bad. I don't have time for you to feel bad. Next time, just check the damn briefcase. This informant I have been hustling just told me about this hot drug house in Inglewood, sitting on a ton of cash. - He says, it's independent. - Finder's fee. - Yeah, zero. 'Cause I bailed his brother on a felony coke charge, last week. Let's do this. Seriously? Where's Mike getting the cash, Mexico City? Yeah. Like I said, I need to de.. No, you listen to me. I am the one who's taking all the risk here, so you.. You hang up on me. Nobody hangs up on me. You hear that, you Armenian, porn peddling, son of a bitch. Is everything okay, boss? Yeah-yeah-yeah, everything's perfect. I got a guy named Ray, gun dealer handcuffed to a chair. Got an Armenian sociopath threatening to slit my throat if I don't get him 50 grand by tomorrow And I got a pregnant stripper named Asia whose Mexican by the way, shaking me for child support. So, yeah, everything is great. Thanks for asking, Johnny. That's my property, Pay up, Ho. 'Yo, I think someone broke into your car, dude'. I just bought that damn thing. Check it out. Ah! Don't move. Stay, stay. I think you broke my nose. No-no-no, stay right there, don't move. I'm done, I am done playing, Ray. I can't just sit around, hoping things work out. Hoping you are, who you say you are. Hoping some guy named Mike shows up with a 100k, you understand? - I propose you come clean. - I already told you. - My ass is on the line here. I got partner's who need to get paid, and these guys.. ...these hypocritical, money obsessed scumbags trust me, they don't believe in excuses. I understand, I do. That's not my problem. Looks like $2000 per stack. 70 grand. - Gonna run an errand. - Be back in an hour. - He's not easy. - I am starting to sense that. This is your last chance, Ray. This is your last chance to tell the truth, right here right now. If you're a snitch, a thief, a cop, that's fine. You're a dead man, obviously, but your wife or your girlfriend, they get a pass. If you keep playing this game and it turns out you're lying you both die and I promise it won't be pretty. You're gonna kill an innocent girl over a damn gun deal, huh? - Hey-hey-hey! Don't you blame me, if she winds up dead. This is on you, pal. Now or never. I'm telling the truth. Go over to the married chick's house. You don't hear from me by 10:00.. ...kill her and make it hurt. 'So why don't we just offer to buy $70,000 worth of guns?' The deal was a $100,000 and we offer $70,000 he'll get spooked. Tell him, we have $100,000. - Set up the buy. Show him the cash, he starts counting, we start shooting. Yeah, like in the movies, right? Excuse me. We start blasting and Ty's a dead man. Not if we're good. Yeah, okay. Can I talk to you? - 30 grand. - Come on, it doesn't matter. - It doesn't work that way. 'Just take it'. I'm not in a mood for debate. Neither am I. So take yes for an answer. - Don't get smart with me. Or you want to save Ty? You got the cash or what? Yeah, all set. Meet me at 25 West Street in an hour. Ray gonna be there? No, he'll be with an associate. Why is that? Gotta make sure the money's green. And if it is? 'We release the guns and Ray'. Lot of hopes. Like selling the house. Keys when the money clears escrow. See you then. Got the queso? - Be my guest. - Looks like we got a deal. - Great. Show him the guns. Looks good. Sorry about all the confusion, chief. Yeah, it's me. We're closed. - Tell Ray, he's a free man. - Let me talk to him. Yeah. It's your boy. - Mike. Yeah, I am cool. - Yes, sir, for real. Just make sure Boyd calls Moosa. No, don't do that, don' t do that. Put it down. Lying son of a bitch. Sorry for all the confusion. Chief. Party's over, Ray. Make sure he knows the deal is closed. That's not my thing, man. I don't need my girl getting shot, 'cause Boyd forgot. I don't have his number. I am a role player. Derek Fisher not Kobe Bryant, I am not even Lamar.. - Please don't shoot me. - Outside. You okay? What the hell? You screwed up, you came home to see Melissa. They followed you. If it bothers you to miss your wife's birthday then, maybe, you should go back to wearing a uniform. Being alone in a crappy motel room disappointing the woman you love that's just the cause of doing business. If you can't handle that or you don't wanna handle that it's time to go. What are you doing here? Does this mean you're done? Where'd you get the money? You're unbelievable. It's two in the morning, Carter. I am serious. I keep certain things close by Things that help me do my job. Drugs, guns, cash. That's why you have it. I want to know, where you got it. What difference does it make, it's a means to an end. That's fine. As long as the end is on the right side of the line. - It is. Positive.
