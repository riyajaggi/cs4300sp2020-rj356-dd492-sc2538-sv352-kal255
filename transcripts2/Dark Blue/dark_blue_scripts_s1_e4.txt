 You disrespecting me? Yeah, I am, so watch yourself tough guy. I said I want a rematch. You know what, Dean, just get him another shot. Huh, one more chance. One more chance. It was double or nothing. You just gonna lose your money. If you don't want a rematch then give my money back. Hey party people, another round of cocktails on me, huh? You stay out of this. I'm gonna tell you one more time, give me back my money. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Dean will slam the trunk when it's a done deal. Then we'll make the arrest.

 There are a lot of guys. Yeah, but they are all wasted. Look at them. We'll be fine Hope you scrub this stuff good. I want it nice and clean. That's what we do. 24-hour laundry service. Whoo-whee, powder business pays well, huh? Telling you, selling heroin should be against the law. You're still going with the whole golf Trufly Incorporated. I'm sorry about banging heads with your boy. - But a deal's a deal. - Shin's a pain. - Always causing problems. - Glad I could help. I should introduce you to my president. He's always looking for deals. President? Yeah. That's what we call the boss of bosses. The king, don. - Pick a word President Lee. Wait, whoa, whoa. - One and only. 'Hey, listen, man, we would be honored' honored to meet President Lee. - I'll put in a good word. - My man. Come on. Why isn't he giving us a signal? What's your piece, Kang? I'm just trying to be a beautiful employee, that's all. But...a ten percent kiss would be much appreciated. Okay. What the hell are they doing? Dean wants to keep the case open for some reason. He wants to stay under. - Oh, yeah. For a big mouth heroin-selling sociopath. But he's worth a shot. We're talking about President Lee here, not your local bookie. We could have arrested Kang on money laundering 'and dismantled the entire heroin operation.' Why would we sell that out to take a flier on Lee? We just postpone it. Kang's talking trash, we bust him. If he's still here? He's a Korean citizen. Flies back and forth to Seoul constantly. - If you wanna take that risk. - Lee's headed the whole Korea-- For fishing expedition. He's not fish, he's a whale, but if that doesn't interest you and you wanna go back to the suburbs-- Shut up, both of you. Touch base with Kang tomorrow. See if he is serious. If he is, take a shot with Lee. If not, take him down. Be thankful, you're not going deep on this one. Go home, relax, see your wife. We're talking about a few more days. Look partner, the act plays out a lot better if we read off the same script. - You know what it means. - I'm just working the case. - You mean, working Carter. No, chasing the big bus like I always do. Like you used to. What the hell did you just say? Thanks for the invite. What're you gonna do? 0 for 30. Hey man, doesn't mean I'll stop trying. So, I talked to Kang. He's setting the meeting up with Lee. It's on. And I'm sorry I didn't mean to crash the thing and.. It's all good. For the record, I've got nothing against turkey burgers. ' - Hey, babe. Hey. Hi. Can I get you something to drink? You didn't offer him anything to drink? No, it's good. I'm leaving anyway. No, no, wait. Um.. - Cool. She's trying to set you up with one of her girls. No. No. She's over here. Candice. Works at the bank. Pretty. Nice body. Easy to talk to. No. It's the last thing I need, okay. Some teller from the valley with expectations. Might as well put a bullet in your head, huh? No. I didn't mean it that way, okay? Look, I know what I got, alright? I know what I got. Take heed, one-night stands are gonna start looking sad on you. Mm-mmm. I'm celibate now. Keeps me focused on the job. Well, you really don't want to talk about it, huh? No. It's just this is normally when the questions start. You've managed to pinpoint it, huh? Well, it's week three. And I just don't want this to get complicated. Relax, champ. I'm not looking for complicated. Good. We have a meeting I didn't know about? I could recommend a great cleaning lady. Please. Pay me more. You've got company. Yeah, a friend from the book club. I'll be quick. I want Lee. Son of a bitch has his hand in everything. Heroin, guns, prostitution. But you have to be smart. He's old-school. It's all about respect. - No more head-butts. - Didn't have a choice. You have to be polite. Deferential. - I'll practice my bow. - Don't get cute. I'm being serious. The deeper the bow the more respect, sir. Just get there on time. - Follow me. Jack Walsh, I work for President Lee. Hi, I'm Elsa. Follow me. Kang's told me great things about you two. That's good to hear. So, where's President Lee? Let's have a drink. - I'm his representative. - It's as if he's here himself. - Yeah, except he's not. But it is not a problem. I mean, I'm sure Kang has told you how we help people clean up their finances, offshore bank accounts, shell corporation. Is that all you do? Help people to wash money? Yeah. We're sort of specialists. We do one thing, we do it well. Uncle Pete always said, "Better to do one thing great than 10 things good." Enjoy your drink. - A pleasure to meet you. - Wait, wait a minute. My partner is a little upset because we were hoping-- No, we were promised a meeting with Lee, not you. 'And our time is valuable, okay?' And we didn't come here to sip soju with his masseuse. - Hey, hey. We didn't come for problems. What was this interview really about anyway? Do you even have the power to say? I mean, what are you, honey, a coat 'Hmm?' Okay. Big man. You want to know? Here. You want this in $20s? It's counterfeit. We want buyers. 60 cents on the dollar. But your partner says you don't dabble. We didn't...until now. So, you're interested? Yeah, absolutely. What do you think, Jorge? It's very, very pretty. Some of the engraving is... sharper than real thing. It's one of the only ways you'll know it's fake. It's actually... better than real money. Watermark, security stripe. My goodness. Russian. - North Korean. - I got it from a Korean. How did you know? They call this a supernote. Very high quality. It's almost impossible to detect. Russians and North Koreans were making these. So this could be coming from overseas. 'Mmm, doubtful.' There was only a small batch made in the '90s. Haven't seen any in a long time. Feds cracked down pretty hard. - The paper. It feels right, you know. That's one thing the North Koreans could never get right. It's the paper. - Looks brand-new. - I'd say two weeks old, tops. So what do you need to make something like that? Intaglio press. You got one of those... you got your own US mint. How much money is she looking to sell? She didn't say. But knowing Lee, probably a lot. 'He may even have one of those intaglio presses.' Carter, we're looking at a major counterfeiting ring here. Right now all we got is a cute Korean chick and a $100 bill. What do we know about Elsa? Kang, Lee, Walsh are in and out of her apartment at all hours. 'Walsh might be her personal bodyguard.' - 'Picks her up, drops her off'' - She's a player. Doesn't mean she'll introduce us to Lee. - He doesn't like to be seen. The clock's ticking on Kang, so I wouldn't-- Talk to Elsa again. See if she can get you a sit-down with Lee. Meeting her tomorrow. I already set it up. Don't cut me off like that. We talked to our client, it turns out that buying money for 60 cents on the dollar is a pretty popular idea. - If the quality is good. - The bills will be perfect. The turnaround time...you getting the bills shipped in? - Fifty thousand. - Not a problem. No. President Lee doesn't get involved in small transactions. How much inventory do you have? - That's not relevant. - Half a million. - Oh, we'll take it. - The whole thing. - $300,000. Getting that-- - Yeah, it's not a problem. - Good. Still too small for President Lee? He'll be there. That is what I'm talking about, t-money. Working it just like the old days, baby. - That was good, felt good. - Let's get a drink. Celebrate. What about that joint we used to hit around here - The one with the Thai dancer. Or Erin? - Ariel, Ariel. Ariel. Remember that prick we used to take there? - Petrosian. Petrosian. - Petrosian. Yeah. Damn, he gave up like half the Armenian mafia, didn't he? Yeah, we gave him six lap dances and a bottle of Jack, so.. I'm sure they weren't really dancing. You know what I mean? Only thing is...where we gonna come up with that kinda money? - Hey, tomorrow's problem. Kang, you know this stuff doesn't happen overnight. You said you'd have it in my bank account in 24 hours. Actually, we said approximately 24.. Kang. Come on, man. Money's coming. 'Just crossing some t's, dotting some i's.' - That's why you hired us. - I don't like waiting. It makes me nervous. If you shoot Dean.. ...just say goodbye to the ten percent kiss we talked about. That mean you and Lee are doing business? Tonight. We're gonna talk about buying some fake cash. Lucky for you. Otherwise.. Whoo! Yo, I got a great idea. Ta-da. - Our buy money. You're gonna use Kang's cash to buy the counterfeit money? We're saving it for later. Why not use it? We lose this money, we lose the bust. - Don't lose it. - That's not what I'm saying. Jaimie and I will be outside. Signal us when you have enough to make the bust. Scott...your boyfriend, the ADA. Things good Right...Scott. Yeah, things are good. How's your love life? Wear this. You have to be deferential. When the soju comes, President Lee will drink first. - And always-- - Pour with both hands. We know. This is President Lee. We drink. President Lee would like to see your money. To a private room, so we can count it. Shouldn't take long. That won't be a problem. You can take our money when we see your money. We'll deliver your merchandise later tonight. You have the president's word. - Two hours, maybe less. You ain't touching the real money 'till we see the fake money.' My friend is not used to doing business this way. 'Please tell President Lee we-'' We don't trust him with $300,000 for two hours. Hell, I don't trust my mother with that kind of money. Get out! We should've just given him the money. So they could rob us? Find out we're cops? Who else hands over $300,000 on blind faith, Dean.. ...to someone they've never done business with? - We were so close. - Yeah, but we had no choice. We did. You just didn't have the stomach for it, Ty. - I'm meeting Kang later today. I can work him. I can work this guy, right? - He could smooth things over. - No, Kang is a waste of time. He treats him like a busboy. Carter, it is Elsa. 'Elsa is the key. He listens to her.' Yeah, he's absolutely right. Just like she shook her head no and killed the deal. That chick wants nothing to do with us right now. Get back with Kang. Process the money. Let him know you're legit, but ask once more about Lee. - See if you get a meeting. Then we bust him on the money-laundering charge. We just give up? We just walk away from.. We should probably get started on the paperwork for Kang's bank accounts. It's a good bust, partner. It's a very safe bust, my friend and I don't do paperwork. Articles of incorporation for your shell company. Here's your bank statement. It's 325k. That's four hundred, minus our consulting fee. So, I can start making withdrawals? Yeah, you can. Look, Kang... about last night.. ...any way we can still make that happen with Lee? My client, he's still interested in buying Lee's bills. You pissed him off, dawg...bad. This guy I represent, he's serious. So, damn straight, I'm gonna protect his investment just like I do yours. Kang, you get me the meet and I'll knock 50% off your next deposit. Plus the ten percent kickback on the counterfeit money. Make it 15. Hey, man, remember me? What the hell are you doing here? Walsh, I don't mean to be a pain. I just want a shot at Lee. You're talking to the wrong guy. Come on, man. That paper Lee's looking to move is perfect. And there's no reason to ruin a good business opportunity just over some silly misunderstanding. I think Elsa would agree. - I don't speak for Elsa. You get Elsa to get me another shot with Lee 'and I'll make it worth your while.' I don't play that game, brother. That's why I'm still breathing. Walsh, we need our keg changed. Take care of it. Guess Lee's not paying top dollar, huh? Go out the back. How about an answer? Lee sees us talking, he's gonna kill us both. Go. - That's a favor. Now get out of here, or I'm gonna kill you myself. Gentlemen. Upstairs. I just need a little backup, okay? - Yeah. I talked to him about it after I asked permission to take a leak. - Ty can handle the paperwork. What's the deal between you two? It'll take 10 minutes, okay? 'I saw President Lee head up to Walsh's place for a meeting'' A crappy apartment above the bar where Walsh works. Wooden door, one lock. Bobby pin, credit card. Fsht! We're gone. God! You scared me. - I, uh.. I didn't think you were gonna be home. Um, I think I left my Bluetooth. I called you, but you didn't pick up. Not a problem. Yeah, I don't know what the "taking a break" rules are. Neither do I. How have you been? Good. Busy. Um, you? Same. Hey, you know, uh, the lens is wide enough but we're gonna...need a.. Oh. You must be, you must be Scott. I'm-I'm Dean Bendis. I work with Jaimie. Oh, g-good. We're-we're working on a case together. Uh, gr...I'm-I'm actually gonna just grab my stuff. - It's probably on the night-- - I'll get it. - No, no, don't worry about it. - I'll get it. I made the bed. Got it. Great. Um...good luck with the case. - Uh, Dean. - Scott. - Good meeting you. - Likewise. - Hey, Jack. I hope it's okay that I waited here. - Oh, God. You don't remember me? No. Well...I wanted to say thanks 'for what you did last week.' 'There was a fight in the bar.' - Yeah. Well, uh, the guy that you "handled" was my ex-boyfriend, complete asshole. - Well, we get a lot of those. - 'Yeah, I'm sure.' I was wondering if I could buy you a drink. You know, to say thank you. No need. - All in a day's work. I'll make it worth your while. I'm sure you would, but now's not a good time. Excuse me. That window was higher than I thought. Couldn't get him to buy you a drink, huh? I don't think he likes blondes. [Lee on screen speaking in foreign language] 'See? I told you, this guy listens to Elsa.' 'He takes her everywhere with him.' [Lee on screen speaking in foreign language] Kang is driving me crazy. He wants me to meet with the Americans again. 'They have a lotta money behind them.' And a lot of arrogance, especially the black one. 'Still, it's 60 cents on the dollar. It's..' We have the press. We call the shots. There it is. 'Not all business, huh?' So, you're gonna tell Kang now? You tell him. If I go, I'll lose my temper. I have to go. My daughter's dance recital. Oh, father of the year. I hope she does well. The compassionate homewrecker. I love it. What? You didn't have a problem with it? Oh, come on. You said you were taking a break. You didn't know that until today. Don't be an idiot. Don't say things like that. - Stop it! - 'Answer me. Did you..' ' 'What'll you do about it?' T I knew Elsa was a lying tramp. - This is great. Because we can extort them. Where the hell you been? You know how much I hate voicemail. Doing my job. So, it turns out your boy Jorge was right. They have a press. You're kidding. Really Elsa's screwing Lee, which I sort of suspected but...she's also screwing Walsh. - That's how we get to Lee. - You wanna blackmail 'em. - That's crazy. I'm sure they don't want Lee finding out they're boning. - I got Kang on the hook. - No. You don't. Kang is driving me crazy. He wants me to meet with the Americans again. They have a lot of money behind them. And a lot of arrogance, especially the black one. Lee...he shot Kang down because of the hissy fit you threw. Carter, I can get back inside, but I've to do it alone. 'You heard Lee doesn't want to do business with you.' If you think you can use the affair to get back in, do it. That's crazy. He just does his own thing and you let that slide. Who says he's doing his own thing? - You're the puppet master. - Don't make this ugly, Ty. We got a clean bust just waiting there. Why not arrest Kang, flip him? 'No telling what he'll tell us about Lee.' We get to the same place without all the risk. And if he doesn't flip? We got a heroin dealer dead to rights on 5 felonies. - I like things planned better. - Okay. One day he's gonna roll a seven, and when he does-- Don't lecture me. You again? Well, you know, our conversation got interrupted last time. Like I said, I got nothing to talk about. You piss off Lee once, that's it. That was my par...my ex-partner pissed him off, not me. Ex Yeah, you know, we've been having some problems. It's not the first time he's done something like that. Do I look like your shrink? No, but you look like a guy who could use some pocket change. I mean, white guy in a Korean gang? Come on. What's the career potential in that, right? You don't know what I do. You hold the door for someone who pays you so little you gotta moonlight in a bar. But, Walsh, if you get me back in with Lee I'll give you a piece of the action. A piece, huh? You'll be rich by Christmas. Not interested. You expecting a hug from Lee when he finds out you're boning Elsa? - You and Elsa. You're screwing. That's the problem with living over a bar. People like to talk. - Yeah, it doesn't matter. It's the truth. And I'm trying to be helpful here, okay? But you're too stupid to realize that, so I gotta play tough guy. So, you'll get me back in with Lee on the counterfeiting deal Or I'll tell him whose pretty little ass you're tapping. You got it? Or maybe I could just kill you instead. Please. You think I'm the only one who knows? I can't get you a meeting. He doesn't listen to me. But he listens to Elsa. How do I know you won't blackmail me again.. ...after we make a deal? I'm a businessman. I'm not interested in ruining your love life. - I just wanna buy that paper. Yeah, absolutely. But I wanna see where Lee prints the money. Where we print the money isn't your concern. Well, my partners want to know where the money comes from. Like I said, they want to do more deals. I'm talking a lot more deals. I mean, there's a lot of bank to be made here, people. But I just need to know you can deliver the goods. - 10% of my fee. I'll talk to Lee. That's the best decision you ever made. Guess what? Deal is going down. - Yes. You're gonna love this. They'll show me where they print the money. Might as well kill that golden goose. He's showing you the press 24 hours ago he wouldn't take your call. - It's called leverage. It's not a problem. - No. Jorge says it'll pass too. - Yeah, well, just doing my job. What's that mean, my friend? You worry more about getting home than getting a bust. - I'm sick of you. - Enough. Sit on Kang. Make sure he doesn't leave town. Get out of here. Go. Ty, go. When you meet with Lee, I want you to make the bust the second you see the counterfeit money. - Forget about the press. This has been going on too long. I want Lee and the funny money in the same room. Got it? - Yes. - Beef. I thought I had low self-esteem. You asked me about me before. I was married. Had a.. I had a good thing going. 'He's here? Bring him in.' On my signal, get ready to move. Yo, yo, if it ain't the money man. - I was gonna call you today. - 50k. - Music to my ears. Came by to make sure everything was a-okay with your new banking situation. Like I said, I'm all about customer service. Good. Matter of fact, made my first withdrawal today. If you need anything, anything at all, you just call me. Will do. So, anyway, about the Lee introduction. Ain't gonna happen. Fine by me, Kang. Hell, the more I think about it the more I think Lee was trying to rip us off. Lee? Are you crazy or something? I assume you're more trusting than your ex-partner. May I? Absolutely. We'll be back shortly. If he was looking to do business for real he at least would've shown me the counterfeit cash. And he sure as hell wouldn't have tried to take my 300k for a 2-hour walk. He's just careful, man. 'Got people counting every penny' and people checking to make sure that the money's real using black lights and everything. I got to make a phone call. Be right back. Pick up, Dean. Come on, buddy. Come on, Dean, pick up the phone. Hey, man, where we going? President Lee called. I got a problem to deal with. - Can't really get into it. - Maybe I can help. - Don't think so. In case you haven't noticed, Lee's not exactly a huge fan. Damn, you got your game face on and all. Must be important. Put the gun down. I'm a cop. - LAPD. You're under arrest. You're kidding, right? What did Lee say that was so damn important? - Go to hell. - Tell me what he said. - I want a lawyer. 'Cause if you don't tell me what he said I'm gonna kill you. - I appreciate your patience. - Not a problem. - Everything's in order. - Terrific. - Now. - Looks good. I'm happy. - Money's there. - Not yet. My partners would like to make additional purchases but I'm gonna need to better understand your operation. So, I need to see where you print the money. Fine. I can take you there now. 'Let's go.' Damn it, he's going after the press. Walsh will show you the press. Oh, no. 'Come out with your hands above your head. Now!' Next time, answer your damn phone. So, how'd you know? I'm the same man I was six months ago, brother. The sooner you realize that, the better. Let me ask you something why didn't we just bust Kang on the money-laundering charge and then flip him? You know, you're right. Now, why in the hell didn't I think of that? - Hi. - Hi. I can't. No, I-I-I didn't come over for that. Okay, well, I didn't, I didn't come over just for that. I just want to talk. About? I don't know, you know. And what do people talk about? You okay? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Scott is here. He's sleeping. Right. I guess the break is over. Night.
