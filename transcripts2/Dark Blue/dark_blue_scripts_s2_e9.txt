FIND OUT WHEN THE NEXT DRUG SHIPMENT'S COMING IN. WE'LL TAKE DOWN THE WHOLE DAMN PIPELINE. IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY. WHY NOT? I SPENT A LITTLE TIME WITH HIM THIS AFTERNOON. NICK'S A... A MESSENGER BOY. I MEAN, IT'S DANNY. HE'S THE ONE WHO CALLS THE SHOTS. SO GET IN WITH HIM. I DON'T KNOW. THESE BROTHERS -- THEY HATE EACH OTHER.

DANNY'S GONNA KILL ME. HE HAS NO IDEA THAT I... HE THINKS THAT I SELL NEGLIGES. LIKE I SAID, MY HUSBAND HAS A REALLY GREAT LAWYER. WELL, THE TRUTH IS, IT'S NOT EVEN MY FAULT. I MEAN, HE'S ALWAYS BITCHING ABOUT ME SPENDING MONEY, AND SO IT'S LIKE, I DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE. I HAVE TO MAKE A DEAL HERE AND THERE. OTHERWISE I'M A SLAVE TO HIS CHEAP ASS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? Ty: ALL SET. PROSECUTOR DROPPED THE CHARGES. WHAT JUST LIKE THAT? YEAH. HE OWED ME A FAVOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH, TY. OH, COME ON, JAIMIE. HOW LONG HAVE WE KNOWN EACH OTHER?

THAT LAWYER IS LIKE... A MAGICIAN! THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF BEING MARRIED TO A CAREER CRIMINAL. GREAT LAWYERS ON SPEED-DIAL. I MEAN, MY HUSBAND'S A BUSINESSMAN. THERE'S A LOT OF LEGAL ISSUES AND THINGS... UH, WELL, DON'T BE EMBARRASSED. MY HUSBAND IS NO ALTAR BOY, EITHER. SO WE HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON. WE'RE BOTH YOUNG, HOT... AND, UM...

I BET YOU HAVE A HELL OF A TIME WITH CUSTOMS NOWADAYS, HUH? NO. PRE-CLEARED, BABY. SEE, FLOWERS... ARE PERISHABLE. SO CUSTOMS... THEY DON'T EVEN LOOK IN THE CONTAINERS. YOU'RE MAKING ME EXCITED HERE, DANNY. WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS, I'M OPEN... TO A CONVERSATION IF YOU ARE. I DON'T KNOW YOU, CARTER... BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. LET ME GIVE MY BROTHER A CALL. HE'S MY BUSINESS PARTNER. SEE IF HE'S AVAILABLE TO COME JOIN US.

TRY AND GET SOMEONE FROM ICE TO SET UP A COKE CONNECTION FOR US IN MEXICO. WHAT'S THE SOONEST -- NICK DIDN'T BLESS THE DEAL. NICK? HE HAS TO BLESS THINGS? I THOUGHT HE WAS A MESSENGER BOY. SO DID I. MAYBE HE SMELLED A RAT. NO, THAT'S NOT IT. WHY DON'T YOU ENLIGHTEN US, THEN? WELL, I HAD DRINKS WITH NICK LAST NIGHT. AND LET'S JUST SAY, MY MAN AIN'T TOO FOND OF CARTER. SAID YOU WERE A DICK. QUOTE. WHAT THE HELL DID YOU SAY TO HIM? I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I WAS PRETTY CHARMING. NO, HE SAID YOU WERE FLIRTING WITH SHARON. WERE YOU? I BARELY TALKED TO HER. YOU FLIRT WITH THE EYES, NOT THE MOUTH. UNLESS YOU'RE FUNNY. EXACTLY. REGARDLESS, WHY WOULD NICK CARE IF CARTER'S FLIRTING WITH DANNY'S WIFE? Dean: MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO PROTECT HIS BROTHER'S TURF. OR HIS. HEY, WAIT.

SHOCKING. NOW WHAT? DO WE FLIP HER? FOR WHAT? SELLING VIAGRA TO HORNY WOMEN? YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA? MAYBE SHE CAN CONVINCE NICK TO CHANGE HIS MIND ABOUT DOING BUSINESS WITH ME. HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT? INSTEAD OF BUSTING HER, WE MAKE HER A PARTNER, GIVE HER A PIECE OF THE ACTION. I MEAN, THIS CHICK LIKES MONEY A LOT. IF WE CAN GIVE HER A CUT OF THE COCAINE ACTION, SHE MIGHT PLAY BALL. WHO'S PHIL? THIS INFORMANT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. TRYING TO DO A DEAL, BUT HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS. WHAT, UH, WHAT KIND OF DEAL? METH. HOW COME YOU LIED TO ME ABOUT VASEK? LIED TO YOU? YOU NEVER SAID THERE WAS A GUN TO YOUR HEAD. NO BIG DEAL. SO, I STILL HAVE SOME PILLS IF YOU WANT. ON THE HOUSE, OF COURSE. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK I'LL WAIT AND SEE IF THE LINGERIE WORKS FIRST. MM. WELL, IF IT DOESN'T, JUST TRY FLIRTING WITH A REALLY CUTE GUY IN FRONT OF YOUR HUSBAND. JEALOUSY TENDS TO WORK A LOT BETTER THAN A LITTLE BLUE PILL. HMM. THAT SOUNDS GOOD. MARRIAGE IS ABOUT MONEY. BUT SEX IS ABOUT SEX. I KNEW I LIKED YOU. ARE YOU A DEVOTED WIFE? MM. SURE. FOR NOW. HMM. SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE LOSING THE FAITH. I DON'T KNOW. CARTER'S SO FOCUSED ON WORK. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL HE EVER TALKS ABOUT. MM. BORING. AND HE'S REALLY PISSY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE DANNY'S BROTHER KILLED A DEAL THEY WERE ALL WORKING ON. NICK KILLED IT. WHY? I'M NOT SURE. YOU AND NICK ARE CLOSE, RIGHT? UH, SURE. YEAH. WE'RE A CLOSE FAMILY. THIS IS A LITTLE AWKWARD. UM... CARTER SAID... CARTER SAID WHAT? THAT IF YOU COULD CONVINCE NICK TO CHANGE HIS MIND, HE'D MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE. YOU SURE SHE'S UP TO THIS? SHE DIDN'T EVEN BLINK. Sharon: CARTER SEEMS LIKE A GOOD GUY. I KNOW DANNY LIKES HIM. Nick: I DON'T CARE WHAT HE THINKS. I DO. HE'S MY HUSBAND. THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE WITH ME? THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE. AH, NICK'S NO GENIUS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE WHEN YOU BUY MAGNUMS. HO-HO. EASY, THERE, TRAMP. DANNY'S SMART. HE DOESN'T TURN DOWN GOOD BUSINESS DEALS FOR NO REASON. THERE'S LOTS OF MONEY TO BE MADE IN MOVING COKE. FINE. FINE. I'LL DO THE DEAL. YOU HAPPY? YEAH. SORTA. WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE YOU HAPPIER? YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE. MAY I LICK YOUR FOOT, PLEASE? I'M GONNA VOMIT. HELLO. YEAH. EVERYTHING'S BACK ON TRACK. I'M MEETING WITH DANNY AND NICK RIGHT NOW TO GO OVER DETAILS. I'LL SEE YOU SOON. WHAT'S UP, FELLAS? WHERE'S DANNY?

I UNDERSTAND, BUT THE PIPELINE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM. WHO CARES ABOUT A CONSPIRACY CHARGE? I GET IT. IT'S A BIG BUST. OUR BOSSES WILL BE IMPRESSED. BUT PROBLEM IS, DUMB BROTHER WANTS TO KILL SMART BROTHER, AND WE CAN'T JUST IGNORE THAT. BUT WE'RE SO CLOSE. IF WE COULD JUST FIND A WAY TO KEEP NICK AWAY FROM DANNY FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO.
