 WHOSE FAULT IS IT? ACTUALLY, IT'S PROBABLY MINE. I PUSHED ALEX TO PUT DUPREE'S FAMILY INTO WITNESS PROTECTION. GARZA NOTICED. HAD HIM KILLED. EITHER WAY, YOU'RE OFF THE CASE. JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE'RE CLOSE TO MAKING A CASE HERE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN CLOSE? ONE OF OUR MEN IS IN WITH GARZA. DEAN BENDIS. HE'S UNDER WITH ONE OF GARZA'S TOP DISTRIBUTORS. EDWIN FINN -- HE'S OUR LINK TO GARZA. I'LL TELL THE D.E.A. TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH UNTIL YOU GUYS PLAY THIS OUT. THANK YOU. BUT THIS TIME, TRY NOT TO GET YOUR INFORMANT KILLED.

 I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SUCH AN EFFECTIVE LIAR. THAT'S NOT VERY NICE. IT WAS MEANT AS A COMPLIMENT. THANKS, I GUESS. OF COURSE, IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO LIE TO YOUR BOSS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A CREDIBLE LEAD. TOO EASY. IT'S MUCH MORE FUN WHEN YOU GOT NOTHING AND YOUR CAREER HANGS IN THE BALANCE. Dean: WHAT'S UP? WE'RE GOING AFTER GARZA. WE NEED YOU TO GET BACK IN WITH FINN'S DAUGHTER, MARIA. WHY FINN? WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE'S MET GARZA, LET ALONE DONE BUSINESS WITH HIM. FINN'S A COKE DEALER WHO JUST LOST HIS SUPPLIER. HE'S EITHER GONNA QUIT THE BUSINESS OR FIND A NEW SOURCE. I'M BETTING ON THE LATTER. YOU THINK HE'S GONNA REACH OUT TO GARZA? MAKES SENSE TO ME. OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. GUYS, THE MARIA THING... I MEAN, I THOUGHT THE CASE WAS OVER. YOU KNOW, I WROTE HER AN E-MAIL YESTERDAY ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP. I -- IT WASN'T EXACTLY WARM AND FUZZY. YOU'RE KIDDING. I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE. CARTER, DATING THE TARGET'S DAUGHTER IS NOT EASY OR FUN. PLEASE. I SAW HER PICTURE. THERE ARE WORSE JOBS OUT THERE THAN DATING A SEXY YALIE. WHAT'S YOUR POINT? TURN ON YOUR BAD-BOY CHARM, GET HER BACK, AND PLANT A WIRE IN HER FATHER'S HOUSE. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THIS GUY'S THINKING, WHAT HIS NEXT MOVE IS. I PRESUME HE'S MORE LIKABLE WHEN HE'S ACTUALLY UNDERCOVER. NOT REALLY. Dean: HI. DID YOU GET MY FLOWERS? YEAH. THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL. TOO BAD I HAD TO THROW THEM IN THE WASTEBASKET. I'M SORRY, MARIA. LIKE I SAID IN MY MESSAGES, I WAS STUPID, AND I -- I FREAKED OUT. WELL, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD AT LEAST ENOUGH RESPECT FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP TO DUMP ME VIA VOICEMAIL. YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS, I HAD ONE TOO MANY. I CALLED YOU A FEW TIMES. YOU DIDN'T ANSWER. SO I... I WAS STUPID. I SENT THAT -- THAT E-MAIL. WELL, THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY. WAIT, WAIT, COME ON. COME HERE. LOOK, I -- I CAME HERE THE OTHER DAY AND YOU WERE WITH SOME TALL, BLOND GUY, YOU KNOW. I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WERE SEEING SOMEBODY ELSE, SO I -- I LEFT. YOU'RE NOT THAT INSECURE. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? YOU -- YOU WENT TO YALE. YOU HANG OUT WITH ALL THESE ART-GALLERY, HIPSTER TYPES, YOU KNOW? I'M SOME GUY WHO WORKS CONSTRUCTION. PLEASE... LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU. YOU GOT TO LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU. I'M GONNA COOK YOU DINNER TONIGHT. I CAN'T. WHY? BECAUSE I'M HAVING DINNER WITH MY FATHER TONIGHT AT HIS HOUSE. OH, AND THE BLOND GUY? THAT WAS MY FRIEND THOMAS. MY VERY GAY FRIEND THOMAS. GOODBYE, DEAN. CAN I HELP YOU? YEAH. IS MARIA AROUND? DAD, THE PASTA'S BOILING. I'M A FRIEND OF HERS. THANKS, DAD. SHE INVITED ME. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M HERE FOR DINNER. YOU INVITED ME FOR DINNER. COME ON. I'M TRYING. GIVE ME A BREAK. SO, YOU GUYS LIVED HERE LONG? EH, 10 YEARS. THAT'S A GREAT PICTURE. BIG FIGHT FAN? Maria: OH, MY DAD'S OBSESSED. HE OWNS A BOXING CLUB DOWNTOWN. PRACTICALLY LIVES THERE. SOME PEOPLE BUY COUNTRY HOMES. MY DAD BUYS A SWEATY GYM. SHE PRETENDS TO BE DISGUSTED, BUT SHE REALLY LOVES IT. WELL, I'D LIKE A HOUSE IN NAPA MORE. WELL, WHO KNOWS? MAYBE WE CAN HAVE BOTH SOMEDAY. DO YOU HAVE A WASHROOM I COULD USE? YEP, DOWN THE HALL. BE RIGHT BACK. Maria: HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE? I SAW THIS PICTURE OF YOU IN A TUTU, AND I HAD TO STOP. PRETTY CUTE, HUH? YEAH. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE A TOMBOY? STILL AM. MM-HMM. WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE. MY DAD'S A LITTLE WEIRD ABOUT PEOPLE BEING IN THE OFFICE. WELL, I DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING. DON'T WORRY. I TRUST YOU. I WANT TO IMPRESS MY BOSS. WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE? AH, NO SOCIAL LIFE. I KNOW THIS LIFE COACH. HE HELPS WORKAHOLIC, DYSFUNCTIONAL MEN MAKE NEW FRIENDS. I HAVE PLENTY OF FRIENDS. I JUST DON'T LIKE HANGING OUT WITH THEM. ANYTHING ON THE WIRE? AROUND 1:00, FINN CALLED SOMEONE NAMED FUENTES. I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS THIS GUY -- PEDRO FUENTES, A MID-LEVEL GARZA PUNK. FINN'S LOOKING TO EXPAND. SEEMS LIKE IT. UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S NOT CHEAP TO PLAY IN THE BIG LEAGUES. Finn: I CAN HANDLE WHATEVER GARZA'S LOOKING TO MOVE. 500K A MONTH? THAT'S A LOT OF QUESO. I-I CAN DO IT. I-I JUST NEED TIME TO PUT IT TOGETHER. HEAR THE HESITATION IN HIS VOICE? HE DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY. BUT HE'S GOT AMBITION, WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WE PARTNER UP WITH FINN SO HE CAN GET IN BUSINESS WITH GARZA. WHO'S OUR IN? ME. OR SHOULD I SAY VINCE AZZO? WHY ARE YOU SMILING? I'M NOT SMILING. WE'LL NEED TO FIND SOMEONE CREDIBLE TO INTRODUCE VINCE TO FINN. I'LL CALL THE TEAM, GET THEM READY. AND THE 500K? THAT'S WHERE THE FED PIGGY BANK COMES IN. SO, D, COME CLEAN. YOU STILL DATING THE MARIA CHICK OR WHAT? Dean: NO, MAN, WE AIN'T DATING. WELL, NOT YET. YEAH, BUT ARE YOU HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH HER? COME ON, T-MONEY. LOOK AT ME. WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO? SHE'S A MARK. THAT WASN'T THE QUESTION. HOLD ON. SHH. HEY. HOW YOU DOIN'? NOTHIN'. JUST WATCHIN' TV. WAIT, MARIA, I-I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT STUFF. YOU SURE? ALL RIGHT. SHE'S FLIPPING OUT ABOUT SOME ARTIST SHE WANTS TO SIGN. SHE WANTS ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT HIS WORK. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS STUFF? SO, YOU GONNA DO IT? HELL, NO. LOOKS LIKE I GOT THE PERFECT MATCHMAKER FOR CARTER -- CAT NAMED MANNY AGUILAR. USED TO RUN FOR ONE OF GARZA'S DEALERS. PERFECT. BRING HIM OVER TO FINN'S CLUB TONIGHT 'CAUSE HIS PRIZED MIDDLEWEIGHT'S FIGHTING SOME TOMATO CAN. I'LL TRY, BUT... BUT WHAT? WELL, HE'S SERVING FOUR YEARS IN CHINO FOR COCAINE POSSESSION. Manny: FINALLY, MY CONJUGAL VISIT. BUT IT'S BEEN SO LONG, IT'S ALMOST LIKE I DON'T REMEMBER -- ALMOST. BUT MY COUSIN CHI CHI, MAN, HE PULLED SOME STRINGS TO GET THIS FREAKY-ASS STRIPPER SENT OVER. NOW, YOU KNOW CHI CHI, HE GOT A WILD IMAGINATION. SO, YOU KNOW, I HOPE HE DON'T BRING ME SOMETHING WITH MUFFIN TOP, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE. HEY, MAN, THANK YOU. WHAT THE HELL?

WELL, I DON'T CARE WHAT GARZA SAYS. THIS IS HOW I DO THINGS. HE WANTS TO TALK, HE CAN COME TO ME. LYING SON OF A BITCH. YEAH, I KNOW, BUT, UH, MAYBE WE SHOULD PLAY ALONG. PUT THE CASH IN THE BIN, GO TO THE STASH HOUSE, PICK UP THE DRUGS, CALL IT A DAY. NOT A PROBLEM, AS LONG AS YOU GUARANTEE MY 500K. YOU DO THAT, I'LL DROP IT IN A DAMN SEWER IF YOU WANT. THOUGHT SO. SO, WHAT THE HELL DO WE DO NOW? HE'LL COME BACK TO US. TRUST ME. $500,000 IS $500,000. NOT TO MENTION XAVIER WAS KILLED THIS MORNING. HEY, IT'S FUENTES. SEE THAT? DIDN'T TAKE LONG, DID IT? I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE WALK AWAY FROM A DEAL. MAKES ME NERVOUS. WE WERE EXPECTING A FACE-TO-FACE. THAT WAS OUR INSURANCE. YOU SAYING YOU DON'T TRUST ME? OF COURSE I DON'T TRUST YOU. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW EACH OTHER. IN FACT, IF I DID TRUST YOU, YOU'D BE AN IDIOT TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN I'M AN IDIOT. YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY, VINCE. IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY, WE'LL DO IT FACE-TO-FACE. I JUST NEED A LITTLE INSURANCE, TOO. LIKE WHAT? PRETTY YOUNG GIRL NAMED MARIA. WHAT? LIVES ON CRESCENT HEIGHTS AND MELROSE. HAS AN ART GALLERY. MY DAUGHTER'S NOT A PART OF THIS, YOU HEAR ME? THAT'S THE DEAL. SORRY. I'M NOT DROPPING 500K IN A TRASH BIN. IT'S EITHER FACE-TO-FACE OR NO DEAL. OKAY. LET'S DO IT. IN PERSON. MIDNIGHT, BOXING CLUB. LET'S GO. THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? BECAUSE WE CONTROL OUR OWN DESTINY. WE'RE NOT THIEVES AND WE'RE NOT COPS. WE'RE GOOD PEOPLE, SO WE HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. NEITHER DOES MARIA. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE. YOU REALLY THINK GARZA'S GONNA SHOW HIS FACE? HE NEEDS THIS DEAL AS MUCH AS WE DO, BELIEVE ME. WHAT ABOUT MARIA? WITNESS PROTECTION. RIGHT. LET'S WAIT A LITTLE WHILE THIS TIME. PUT A SURVEILLANCE TEAM ON HER TILL THE BUST GOES DOWN, THEN BRING HER IN AND START THE CONVERSATION. CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT? HUH? ABOUT WE'RE GONNA RUIN HER LIFE OR ABOUT HOW SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO LOOK OVER HER SHOULDER TILL THE DAY SHE DIES? I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT. SHE DOESN'T DESERVE TO DIE JUST 'CAUSE HER DAD'S A CROOK. YOU'RE 100% RIGHT, BUT IT'S IRRELEVANT. SHE'S COLLATERAL DAMAGE. IT'S NOT FAIR. IT'S NOT GOOD. IT JUST IS. Alex: I KNOW WE ASKED YOU TO GET CLOSE TO HER, CLOSER THAN USUAL, BUT NOW'S THE TIME FOR YOU TO BACK OFF AND PRETEND IT NEVER HAPPENED. WHY -- WHY ARE YOU PUSHING THIS SO HARD, HMM? YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE A NAME FOR YOURSELF WITH THE BOYS UPSTAIRS, RIGHT? WE'RE MOVING FORWARD. I'M SORRY. HEY, WELL, DON'T APOLOGIZE TO ME. OKAY. REEL HER IN, WHORE HER OUT, RUIN HER LIFE, AND FOR GOOD MEASURE, PUT A GIANT BULL'S-EYE ON HER BACK. AND THEN PRETEND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. COPY THAT. WE DIDN'T MAKE FINN SELL DRUGS OR REACH OUT TO GARZA OR HAVE A DAUGHTER NAMED MARIA. YOU LOOKING FOR MARIA? NO. WELL, THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? SOMETHING WRONG, SON? I'M A COP. SO, YOU AND THIS VINCE PRICK JUST -- INVESTIGATING ME IS ONE THING, BUT USING MY DAUGHTER? YOU BRING HER INTO THIS WHOLE MESS? HEY, LOOK, YOU DECIDED TO SELL DRUGS FOR A LIVING, NOT ME. I DID IT FOR MY KID SO SHE COULD HAVE A BETTER LIFE. NO, DON'T GIVE ME THAT SELF-RIGHTEOUS BULLSHIT. YOU DID IT TO MAKE MONEY. SO, WHY YOU TELLING ME ALL THIS, TOUGH GUY? I MEAN, WHAT'S THE POINT HERE? LOOK, WHEN WE BUST YOU AND GARZA, THEY'RE GONNA KNOW YOU SCREWED UP. 'CAUSE THEY'RE GONNA KNOW YOU BROUGHT SOME GUY NAMED VINCE AZZO INTO THE GAME AND HE TURNED OUT TO BE A COP. AND THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA DO NEXT? THEY'RE GONNA KILL YOU. THEN THEY'RE GONNA KILL MARIA. SHE DOESN'T DESERVE TO DIE. NO. NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. SHE DOESN'T. THAT'S WHY YOU AND ME... WE'RE GONNA FIX THIS. HOW? Jaimie: WHERE THE HELL'S GARZA? Carter: THEY'LL BE HERE. WHAT ABOUT FINN? I CALLED 10 MINUTES AGO. NO ANSWER. MARIA GAVE ME THIS FOR MY BIRTHDAY. I WAS GONNA SAVE IT FOR BIG EVENTS -- WEDDINGS, BIRTH OF A GRANDCHILD, BUT... IT'S FROM A TINY VILLAGE CALLED AIRIGH NAM BEIST. IT'S GAELIC FOR "SHELTER OF THE BEAST." LEGEND HAS IT THAT IN THIS TOWN, AN EVIL BEAST LAYS IN WAITING. THIS WHISKEY IS THE ONLY ANTIDOTE TO PROTECT SOMEONE FROM THE TERRIFYING, LURKING MONSTER. MMM. IT'S GOOD. DON'T TELL MARIA YOU'RE A COP OR ABOUT ANY OF THIS. OKAY? GARZA AND FUENTES ARE INSIDE. Doesn't look like they're carrying any product. COPY THAT. ANY WORD FROM FINN? NOT YET. DEAL'S OFF. WHAT? YEAH. FINN JUST GOT ARRESTED FOR TAX EVASION AND WIRE FRAUD. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? I'M NOT GONNA BLOW UP HER LIFE. NO. NOT FOR THIS. SO YOU'RE GONNA GIVE GARZA A FREE PASS INSTEAD? I SHOULD FIRE YOUR SKINNY ASS. YOU HEAR ME? WHERE YOU GOING? WE CAME HERE TO TAKE GARZA DOWN. THAT'S WHAT I INTEND TO DO. YOU DO THAT, AND MARIA DIES. JAIMIE NEVER SAW ANY DRUGS. THEY WENT IN THERE EMPTY-HANDED. Alex: CARTER, COME ON. THINK ABOUT THIS. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? Carter: LOOKING FOR DRUGS. YOU FIND ANY? NO, BUT I'M GONNA TAKE A RUN AT HIM ANYWAY. IF HE AGREES TO A PRICE, A QUANTITY, THAT'S ENOUGH. MAYBE. SOMETIMES MAYBE'S GOOD ENOUGH. STAND DOWN, CARTER. I SAID, STAND... DOWN! YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THIS? POSITIVE. [ MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS IN DISTANCE ] WELL, I'D ASK YOU HOW THAT WENT, BUT I'VE BEEN STANDING OUT HERE SO DAMN LONG, I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER. HOW MUCH YOU PAY HER, ANYWAY? NOT A PENNY. REALLY? WELL, AT LEAST I GET TO DIE IN JAIL A HAPPY MAN. WELL, YOU MAY BE AROUND LONGER THAN YOU THINK. D.A. AGREED TO SHAVE A YEAR OFF YOUR SENTENCE AND TRANSFER YOU TO PROTECTIVE HOUSING. FOR REAL? MM-HMM. YOU'RE GONNA MISS ME, AIN'T YOU? Carter: HOW'D THE BOSS TAKE THE NEWS? HE'S NOT PUTTING ME UP FOR DIRECTOR ANYTIME SOON. WHY'D YOU DO IT? DO WHAT? LIE TO HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE? DADDY ISSUES. I'M SERIOUS. I HATE LOSING MORE THAN I LIKE WINNING, WHICH MEANS I'M MOTIVATED MORE BY THE FEAR OF REJECTION THAN THE PURITY OF SUCCESS, WHICH, SADLY, IS MORE SELF-DESTRUCTIVE THAN IT IS SELF-EMPOWERING. THAT'S WHAT MY SHRINK SAYS, ANYWAY. YOU HATE TO LOSE SO MUCH, WHY'D YOU BLOW THE CASE? TRUTH IS, I WANTED TO BUST GARZA, JUST LIKE YOU. WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE. NOTHING TO DO WITH MARIA? NOTHING. WHAT ABOUT DEAN? DISCIPLINARY ACTION? I SAY WE MOVE ON. YEAH. TOO BAD WE DECIDED NOT TO -- IT WAS A STUPID DECISION. EXCUSE ME, MISS, DO YOU SELL ANY MOODY BLACK HEY. HEY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT OF TOWN. YEAH, I WAS, BUT NOW I'M BACK. ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS. I'M MOVING TO BOSTON. WORKING ON A NEW HOUSING PROJECT WITH MY COUSIN KEN. THAT'S GREAT. I GOT YOUR TEXT. SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR FATHER. YEAH. I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT. BUT HE CALLED THE FBI HIMSELF, TURNED HIMSELF IN, SO... WELL, HE RUINED HIS LIFE. HE DIDN'T RUIN YOURS. YOU KNOW, YOU GOT YOUR FRIENDS. STILL GOT YOUR GALLERY. STILL GOT YOUR FUTURE. L.A. DEAN... GOOD LUCK. YEAH. YOU TOO.
