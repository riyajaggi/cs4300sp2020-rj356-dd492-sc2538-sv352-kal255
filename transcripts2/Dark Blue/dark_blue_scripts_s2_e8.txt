 HANG IN THERE. C.J.: WHERE'S YOUR SISTER? C.J., COME ON! WE'RE GONNA GET SOME HELP. HANG IN THERE! Ty: COME ON! GO IN THE CAR! GET UP! HANG IN THERE, C.J. DRIVE! DRIVE! DRIVE! WE WERE JUST ALL HANGING OUT, JUST ALL OUT THERE CHILLIN'. A CAR FULL OF MEXICANS DROVE UP, ASKED C.J. A FEW QUESTIONS. THEY STARTED SHOOTING. YOU AIN'T KNOW NONE OF THEM? NO, I AIN'T KNOW NONE OF THEM. WELL, DID YOU GET A LOOK AT THE SHOOTER, AT LEAST? NO. I TOLD YOU A THOUSAND TIMES, YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO YOU SOCIALIZE WITH. COME ON, SIS. C.J.'S OKAY. I'VE KNOWN HIM MY WHOLE LIFE. I HOPE HE LIVES, BUT C.J.'S A DRUG-DEALING PUNK. WHAT I'M GONNA SAY TO THE POLICE, HUH? YOU TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW. THAT'S WHAT YOU TELL THEM. What about the bag? Look, I can't get jammed up in this heroin business. Colleges get nervous about this. Was it your gym bag? Hell, no. Then you'll keep your mouth shut. Woman: NO. NO! GOD, NO! PLEASE! WHY? WHY DID IT HAPPEN TO MY C.J.? IT'S CONFUSING, IT'S HEARTBREAKING, I KNOW. BUT WE WILL PERSEVERE, AND WE WILL WIN THIS FIGHT AGAINST SENSELESS VIOLENCE. I PROMISE. MY ASSISTANT WILL CALL TO DISCUSS FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. YES. THANK YOU. OKAY. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. Man: I'M SO SORRY. WALTER SHELL. Ty: OH, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. DEVIN WRIGHT. I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE HELPED, BUT WE DID THE BEST WE COULD, MR. SHELL. MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU IN PRIVATE, DEVIN? OF COURSE. YEAH. TIMES LIKE THIS... THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO PROTECT THE LEGACY OF THE DECEASED AND THE REPUTATION OF OUR COMMUNITY. I FOLLOW, SIR. IT'S A COMPLICATED WORLD OUT THERE FOR YOUNG BROTHERS. PEOPLE... DO THINGS TO GET BY, TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. IT'S WRONG, IT'S ILLEGAL, IT'S SHAMEFUL, BUT... MATTERS LIKE THIS SHOULD BE DEALT WITH PRIVATELY... IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. I DO. I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A GYM BAG. YES, SIR, UM... THE GYM BAG WAS IN THE STREET. IS THAT RIGHT? I DIDN'T LOOK INSIDE, OF COURSE, AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO WITH IT. WELL, IF IT COULD MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR YOU, I COULD HAVE ONE OF MY MEN PICK IT UP. Carter: SHELL? AS IN WALTER SHELL? IT'S UNBELIEVABLE, MAN. WALTER SHELL IS A DIRTY DUDE. WELL, MAYBE HE'S JUST BEING PROTECTIVE OF THE KID'S REPUTATION, THAT'S ALL. NO, CARTER, IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THAT, MAN. I GOT A LOOK AT HIM, YOU KNOW? I LOOKED IN HIS EYES. AND THIS EVA WOMAN? UH, SHE'S A FRIEND, YOU KNOW? I SEE HER FROM TIME TO TIME. THAT'S IT. SHE KNOW YOU'RE A COP? SHE KNOW YOUR REAL NAME? NO. AND SHE LIVES IN THE PROJECTS. CARTER, SHE'S A GOOD WOMAN. I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE FACTS. THAT'S ALL, TY. WHAT'S UP WITH THE LUGGAGE? I'M TAKING A MIDNIGHT CRUISE TO MEXICO. SHUFFLEBOARD, BINGO, BUFFETS, SKYDIVING, JET SKIING -- THE WHOLE NINE. WOW. REALLY? COME ON, TY. CLEAN YOURSELF UP, AND I'LL SEE YOU IN THE OFFICE IN ABOUT A HALF-HOUR. YOU GOT IT. SEE YOU THERE. Alex: WALTER SHELL? WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST COMMUNITY SAVIOR TO BE A LYING SCUMBAG. WERE YOU ALWAYS THIS CYNICAL? LET ME THINK. YEAH. YEAH, I DON'T LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS EVA THING. PUTS TY IN A TRICKY POSITION. THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT. AND THE OTHER WAY? IT'S IDEAL. HE'S ALREADY IN. PLUS, SHELL THINKS THAT HE'S A LITTLE DIRTY FOR TURNING OVER THE HEROIN ANYWAY. ASK ME, IT'S CLOSE TO PERFECT. YOU SURE THIS MAKES SENSE? IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY, RIGHT? TILL YOU FIND A PLACE. I KNOW. IT JUST FEELS A BIT PREMATURE. IT'S... IT'S GONNA BE GREAT. WALTER SHELL HAS TWO PRIORS -- ASSAULT IN '87 AND COCAINE POSSESSION, '89. AFTER THAT? AFTER THAT, HE GOT RICH SELLING DOUGHNUTS TO THE POOR. AND IT LOOKS LIKE HE STARTED INVESTING IN VARIOUS CHARITIES AND FOUNDATIONS. FLANKING HIMSELF WITH FANCY POLITICIANS AND FRIENDS. HE'S GOT AN FBI FILE, TOO. Dean: YEAH. WHO DOESN'T? THERE ARE LOTS OF ALLEGATIONS -- MOSTLY DRUGS BUT NOTHING SOLID. SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? PROOF THIS GUY'S ACTUALLY WORTH INVESTIGATING? YOU KNOW, GUYS, I CAN TAKE A RUN AT SHELL DIRECTLY. I'VE BEEN WORKING THAT NEIGHBORHOOD A FEW MONTHS NOW. NEIGHBORHOOD OR THE CHICKS? TELL HIM YOU'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND YOUR LAUNDROMAT COMPANY AND THAT YOU NEED INVESTORS. IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S CHECK OUT THE COMPTON HEROIN SCENE AND FIGURE OUT WHO'S CALLING THE SHOTS AND SEE IF HE'S CONNECTED TO SHELL. IT'S THE TRUTH. SHELL? COME ON, MAN. HE'S A LEGEND. HALF THE DAMN BUILDINGS ARE NAMED AFTER HIS ASS. DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT SLINGING "H," RIGHT? COULD BE. I DON'T KNOW. I NEVER HEARD NOTHING ABOUT THAT. YEAH, OKAY. SO WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD? WHO'S IN CHARGE AROUND HERE? IT'S TOUGH TO SAY. THERE'S LOTS OF GANGS. LOTS OF GHETTO POLITICS. YOU KNOW. ALL RIGHT, LOOK. PARTY FAVORS, ALL RIGHT? I WANT YOU TO GIVE THESE TO ALL YOUR BOYS. MM. HEY, HEY, HEY. BUT YOU MAKE SURE THEY KNOW WHERE YOU GOT IT FROM. DEAN, YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND, MAN? THIS IS COMPTON. PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST GONNA STICK AROUND AND LET SOME WHITE BOY MOVE PRODUCT ON THEIR TURF. OKAY. WHAT'S YOUR MEANING? THEY'RE GONNA COME LOOKING FOR YOUR ASS. THAT'S THE POINT, DUMMY. GET IT OUT THERE. WHAT YOU LOOKING AT? YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT THE DUDE. YOU EVER HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH HIM? NO. LIKE I SAID, I DON'T KNOW THE MAN. I'VE SEEN HIM AROUND TOWN HERE AND THERE, BUT THAT'S IT. HE SEEMED LIKE A PRETTY COOL DUDE, YOU KNOW? I WAS JUST WONDERING IF HE WAS LEGIT, THAT'S IT. WHY ARE YOU SO CURIOUS ABOUT HIM? JUST WONDERING IF HE COULD HELP OUT WITH MY BUSINESS -- YOU KNOW, MAYBE HIS WALLET. WELL, HE'S GOT LOTS OF CASH, THAT'S FOR SURE. BUT... IS HE LEGIT? WHO KNOWS? YEAH, WHO KNOWS? HOW ABOUT JOSHUA? IS YOUR BROTHER LEGITIMATE? YEAH, JOSH IS A -- HE'S A GOOD KID. YOU KNOW, HE RUNS WITH A ROUGH CROWD. BUT THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THAT, NOT AROUND HERE. HAS HE EVER BEEN LOCKED UP? HE EVER BEEN ARRESTED? NO. DOESN'T OWN A GUN EITHER, UNLIKE YOU. YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE A BUSINESSMAN, WHY THE HELL DO YOU HAVE A GUN IN THE BACK OF YOUR DAMN PANTS? BECAUSE I OWN A BUSINESS THAT AIN'T NECESSARILY LOCATED IN BEVERLY HILLS, MISS EVA. IT'S DANGEROUS, YOU KNOW, SO I CARRY A PIECE. I DON'T DATE CRIMINALS, D. I DON'T SCREW THEM EITHER. LUCKY FOR ME...

THERE'S GOT TO BE AN EASIER WAY TO DO THIS. EASIER, YEAH. FASTER, NO. Shell: I WAS 18... POOR... UNEDUCATED. LIKE MANY OF YOU, I MADE MISTAKES. BUT I WAS ABLE TO TURN MY LIFE AROUND AND BECOME A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF THIS COMMUNITY. IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO PRESENT TO YOU THE WALTER SHELL COMMUNITY CENTER! Ty: MR. SHELL. IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MAN. DEVIN WRIGHT. I REMEMBER YOUR NAME, YOUNG MAN. WALTER SHELL NEVER FORGETS A FACE. ESPECIALLY THE FACE OF A SMART MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS THE SOCIETAL COMPLEXITIES OF THE WORLD. I APPRECIATE THAT. IN FACT, I ACTUALLY WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT MY BUSINESS. SURE.

I'M FILING AN INJUNCTION THIS AFTERNOON. YOU AND JOSH WILL BE BACK TOGETHER BEFORE TOMORROW MORNING. Shell: CHOCOLATE-COVERED DOUGHNUTS... ALWAYS TASTE GOOD. GOOD TIMES, BAD TIMES. ALL THE TIME. JUST LIKE YOUR BUSINESS. WASHING CLOTHES. AMEN. IT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT, NO MATTER WHAT. PROBLEM IS, IT'S NOT VERY PROFITABLE. I MEAN, HOW MANY QUARTERS CAN A BROTHER COLLECT EACH WEEK? YEAH. I HEAR YOU. WELL, TO BE TRUTHFUL, MR. SHELL, THAT'S EXACTLY WHY A BROTHER'S TRYING TO EXPAND INTO MORE LUCRATIVE BUSINESS LINES, IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING. SUCH AS? PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THAT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT, NO MATTER WHAT, LIKE YOU SAID. DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE? MOSTLY THE WHITE POWDER, BUT I'M TRYING TO EXPAND INTO SOMETHING A LITTLE DARKER. LIKE THEY SAY, BLACK IS...BEAUTIFUL. WELL, I'M ALWAYS INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH INTELLIGENT AND TRUSTWORTHY YOUNG MEN. 50% OF ALL PROFITS WILL BE CONTRIBUTED TO THE WALTER J. SHELL FOUNDATION. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY. WE NEED TO PRODUCE MORE DOCTORS, LAWYERS, SCIENTISTS. FOR EVERY LIFE I DESTROY... ...I SAVE A THOUSAND. ASK ME... ...THAT'S A HELL OF A TRADE. LOOK, I'M MEETING WITH SHELL'S GUYS IN THREE HOURS. I SAY WE BUST THEM ALL TONIGHT, RIGHT THEN, RIGHT THERE. THE CLOCK IS TICKING. WE NEED TO PLAY THIS OUT A BIT MORE. GET IN DEEPER. THE PROBLEM IS, EVA'S LAWYER JUST FILED THE INJUNCTION THIS AFTERNOON, AND SO I DON'T REALLY THINK I HAVE A CHANCE TO GET ANY DEEPER THAN THAT. SHELL KNOWS TOO MANY PEOPLE. HE'S TOO POWERFUL. IT HAS TO BE PERFECT. WE NEED HIS FAT ASS ON CAMERA, SMILING, HOLDING A BAG OF HEROIN. GOT IT. I AGREE WITH TY. LET'S NOT WAIT TOO LONG. YEAH, I GET IT. BUT IF WE WANT THIS BUST TO STICK, WE NEED MORE THAN JUST A CONVERSATION. I DON'T MEAN TO BE HIGH-MAINTENANCE OR ANYTHING, BUT I'M GETTING TIRED OF HIDING. YEAH? I'M SORRY. YOU FIND THAT BRACELET YET? NO. I TALKED TO ROSIE ABOUT IT. HOW LONG HAS SHE WORKED FOR YOU? ARE YOU SUGGESTING SHE TOOK IT? JUST ASKING. SHE'S NOT A THIEF. YESTERDAY I LEFT 10 BUCKS IN MY COAT POCKET. YOU SET UP MY CLEANING LADY? SHE TOOK THE MONEY. I TOOK IT. I KNEW YOU WERE SUSPICIOUS, SO I GRABBED IT JUST FOR FUN. I MEAN, COME ON. SHE'S BEEN WITH ME FOR SIX YEARS. JUST INDULGE ME, OKAY? YOU WANT TO SET UP ANOTHER TRAP? YEAH, SO I KNOW FOR SURE. IS THIS YOUR PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE WAY OF SAYING YOU DON'T LIKE LIVING HERE? NO. I JUST... I HAVE A FEELING. FINE. WE'LL SET A TRAP. HAPPY? YOU BETTER BE. Hastings: GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, DEVIN. YOU GET AROUND, DON'T YOU? WHERE'S MR. SHELL? HE'S NOT COMING. HE WANTED ME TO DISCUSS THE TERMS OF HIS INVESTMENT. MR. SHELL'S GONNA INVEST $100,000. THE PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO EXPAND YOUR LAUNDROMAT BUSINESS INTO MORE PROFITABLE AREAS. NOW, MR. SHELL WILL HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DAY-TO-DAY INVOLVEMENT WITH YOUR BUSINESS. I SEE. STRICTLY AN INVESTOR. IN RETURN, THE PROFITS WILL BE ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS. 50% TO THE WALTER J. SHELL FOUNDATION, 20% TO THE UNITED METHODIST CHURCH, AND 30% TO YOU. THE TERMS ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE. GOT IT. SO WHERE DO I PURCHASE THE PRODUCT? AN ASSOCIATE OF HIS WILL DELIVER IT TO YOU PERSONALLY. OKAY. SO, WHEN DO I MEET THIS ASSOCIATE? HOW ABOUT NOW? I HEAR WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING TOGETHER, D. IT'S FUNNY THE WAY THINGS TURN OUT, HUH? WELL, YOU KNOW, UM... ...MAYBE IT MEANS WE'RE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER. I DON'T LIKE TO LIE. BUT IT'S... NOT THAT EASY TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW? I FEEL THE SAME WAY. SO THERE'S NO... JUDGMENT HERE? TRUTH IS, I GOT INTO THIS TO HELP JOSH PAY FOR COLLEGE. SO, HOW DOES THIS WORK? I PICK UP THE PRODUCT, DELIVER IT TO YOU, AND COLLECT THE CASH -- THAT'S IT. NO QUESTIONS, NO CONVERSATIONS -- NOTHING. I'M AN ERRAND GIRL. YOU'RE A DAMN SEXY ERRAND GIRL. YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S RUNNING HEROIN? I'M JUST AS SURPRISED AS YOU, ALEX. I HAD NO IDEA. NO IDEA? REALLY?! LISTEN TO ME, DAMN IT. SHE LIVES IN THE PROJECTS, WORKS IN A BAR, HER BROTHER HANGS OUT WITH DRUG-SLINGING GANGBANGERS WHO GET SHOT IN DRIVE-BYS, AND YOU HAD NO IDEA THAT SHE MIGHT BE DIRTY?! JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE POOR DON'T MAKE YOU DIRTY. THAT'S NOT THE POINT, AND YOU KNOW IT! THE POINT IS, I FELL FOR A GIRL THAT I THOUGHT WAS A COOL GIRL. I'M JUST AS SHOCKED AS YOU. DON'T GIVE ME THIS INNOCENT CUB SCOUT BULLSHIT. WHAT IS YOUR REAL PROBLEM, ALEX? YOU'VE BEEN SCREWING A CHICK FOR WEEKS WHO DOESN'T KNOW YOUR DAMN NAME, THAT YOU'RE A COP! EVERYBODY CALM DOWN. WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT. FIGURE WHAT OUT? IT'S OVER. OVER? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE CAN'T MAKE A CASE AGAINST SHELL. TY'S TESTIMONY IS MEANINGLESS. HE'S GOT CONFLICTS ALL OVER THE PLACE. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. SO WE'LL BUILD A CASE THAT DOESN'T RELY ON TY'S TESTIMONY, THAT'S ALL. HOW? I'LL FIGURE IT OUT. THAT'S HOW. YOU GOT MY WORD ON IT. YOUR WORD? I DON'T THINK IT'S AS VALUABLE AS YOU THINK. YOU HAVE 24 HOURS. THAT'S IT. YOU GOT YOURSELF INTO THIS MESS. NOW GET YOURSELF OUT. YOU HEAR ME? LIKE I SAID BEFORE, WE NEED THIS PRICK ON CAMERA. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? GOOD. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. YOU OKAY? YEP. NEVER BEEN BETTER. WELL, UM, WE'LL TALK LATER ON, OKAY? YEAH. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT, WALTER? WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?! YOU DON'T BRING THAT STUFF IN HERE! MY FIRST DEAL AND EVA GETS PINCHED?! MY FIRST DEAL?! YOU A RAT? YOU A COP? WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHAT?! EVA GOT BUSTED? WHEN? 10 MINUTES AGO, I WALK OUT OF A DAMN DOUGHNUT SHOP, AND YOU TELL ME WHY THERE'S BLUE LIGHTS EVERYWHERE! HUH? YOU TELL ME THAT! YOU... BETTER WATCH YOUR TONE, SON. OR WHAT? YOU GONNA ARREST ME, MR. OFFICER? HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN EVEN TRUST THAT EVA BITCH?! HOW DO I KNOW SHE'S NOT GONNA FLIP ON ME?! YOU AIN'T GOT TO WORRY ABOUT NONE OF THAT. WHY THE HELL NOT, BIG BOY?! BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE IN MY ORGANIZATION GET BUSTED... THEY GET DEAD. YOU TELLING ME YOU GOT THE STOMACH... TO KILL FOR ONE OF THESE BRICKS HERE? YOU THINK I'VE MADE MILLIONS SELLING SMACK 'CAUSE I AIN'T GOT THE STOMACH TO KILL SOME SKINNY BITCH?! PLEASE! HER LITTLE ASS WILL BE DEAD BY THE TIME I SIT DOWN TO EAT MY STEAK DINNER TONIGHT! AND I PROMISE YOU -- I PROMISE YOU SOMETHING ELSE, BROTHER. THAT LITTLE PIECE... OF FILET WILL STILL TASTE DAMN GOOD. Dean: HEY, HOW YOU DOIN'? L.A.P.D. PLEASE PUT YOUR HANDS UP IN THE AIR. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. I'M THE COP, WALTER. AND I'M THE SAVIOR OF THIS DAMN COMMUNITY. THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL THEY'LL CONVICT ME. IS THAT RIGHT? YOUR WORD AGAINST MINE?! PROBLEM IS... MY WORDS COUNT FOR A LOT MORE! YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT YOUR WORDS DON'T COUNT MORE THAN VIDEOTAPE. YEAH, 'CAUSE THE PROBLEM IS, HE'S GOT A VIDEO CAMERA IN HIS HAT. THEY MAKE THEM REAL SMALL THESE DAYS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. GUYS. ALL RIGHT. TAKE HIM. ...I'VE MADE MILLIONS SELLING SMACK 'CAUSE I AIN'T GOT THE STOMACH TO KILL SOME SKINNY BITCH?! IT'S INCREDIBLE. REALLY HUNG HIMSELF, DIDN'T HE? THE GOOD NEWS -- THIS CASE IS FOOLPROOF. I MEAN, TY'S GOT SHELL ON CAMERA, ADMITTING TO MURDER, SELLING HEROIN. NOBODY CAN GET OUT FROM UNDER THAT, NOT EVEN SHELL. YEAH. WE GOT LUCKY. I TALKED TO CAPTAIN MAYNARD THIS AFTERNOON. I ASKED HIM TO SUSPEND YOU TWO WEEKS, NO PAY. SHOULD'VE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR CONVERSATION WITH MAYNARD. I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT -- BUT WHAT? I WASN'T IN THE MOOD TO BE TALKED OUT OF IT. TY GOT HIMSELF INTO A TOUGH SITUATION, NO DOUBT. BUT THINGS HAPPEN ON THE STREET WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE CASES.
