 You're seriously gonna put that on your body? 'Yeah, full-chest piece'' The minute I can afford it. Which is soon, right? If this guy ever shows up. Sykes is reliable. Reliable smack dealers do not exist. He's gonna show. He's gonna be here then we're gonna own the whole street, the whole neighborhood. But until then, we don't own piss. 'Just white boys fighting for respect.' So drop your pud and watch traffic.

 Lokes. It's their hood. For now anyway. Nah. After the deal. No one's having fun, huh? I'm back here having a blast. - Everyone's just freakin'-- There's no time for fun! We're in a damn war! Put that away. You really think a bunch of white boys can take over Venice? You ringing? Text. My sister wants to have lunch. Meaning? She needs money.

 Well, it's the first time she's asked, huh? Not the first time this month. Black crotch rocket. Two riders. I don't like it. - Moving kind of slow, Carter. - Two males. Two males. - Gun! - It's an ambush! 'Anyone got a visual on Dean?' Can you see Dean? You need to get to a hospital now. There's one a mile away. Go there, now! 'We don't have time for payback, Pike. Go, Hallsy, now!' 'Move it back! Go!' 'We got to get to a hospital! Now!' Right there, right there. Where? - Right there. Stop. Hey! Where you going? Pike, those are cops, man. Look, I'll meet me in the alley behind Washington. Go! Get out of here! Scumbag Sykes set us up. I'm gonna blow his damn head off. Get to a hospital! You deal with the ride, okay? I'll handle the guys. Hey, Pike. Be better if the guys knew there was another dope deal lined up. Oh, your connection? Oh, yeah. Hallsy's been talking it up. - It's a phone call away. - Sure does. Well, O'Neill, O'Neill don't do deals with pledges. You want to get something done, you work through Hallsy. Look, five minutes, Pike. That's all I'm asking. He's legit. So is his connection. Grab some rags and clean the ride, right now. Pike, you wanna do this, you gotta move fast. Yeah Because the team with the most heroin wins this war, pal. And the guy upstairs, last time I checked, he's got nothing. Clean out the ride. If I were in the back, or a bullet ricocheted.. You weren't, and it didn't, okay? Now shut up. - I wanna see this through.. Wanna go to Pelican Bay for five more years? Better than a bullet in my head? Yeah. Five years is a long time not to see your son. You're my snitch, until we bust these guys. You know what? One more week. That's it. We got a status on the kid who got shot? The one that Kings dumped two blocks from the ER? Yeah, he's in surgery, barely hanging on. The shooters were Lokes defending their turf. Eddie Sykes tipped 'em off most likely. Most definitely. 'The most heroin Sykes has moved is a single key.' Now, in the middle of a heroin draught, he says he has five? 'Why the double cross'' We have no evidence he has allegiance to the Lokes. The Kings' money spends like any other. What're we doing? Get rid of whities, so Lokes win the heroin war? - Atleast we're not racist. - I'm serious. The Kings are ambitious. Big ideas, big goals. They think like businessmen, not gangbangers. 'If the Kings win the war, they'll expand the business' 'in a way the Lokes never could.' So, yeah, I guess we are trying to help the Lokes in a way. Excuse me, Jaimie. I need like an hour of personal time. Everything alright? - Sis. - Ouch. Good luck. ' - 'I told you it was bad.' D, for what? Remember Lisa. The girl I went to beauty school with way back when? Yeah, I think so. My head is spinning here. I borrowed her car when mine was in the shop.. ...and then I got t-boned by some drunk in a pickup. - You don't care about me. - You're sitting right here. I paid Lisa back for the car with my own money. What I thought was a sprain, was a broken wrist. - The navicular bone. - I don't know what that is. How bad is it, D? How bad is it? Well, it needs to be pinned.. ...which is surgery. It's just so tight right now, you know? I mean, we're living paycheck to paycheck around here. Plus, Mel and I are talking about kids. Great. Congratulations. Look, Ty, this isn't easy for me. You know, I'm the big sister here. Yeah, D, I know. You think it's really easy for me to ask you for money? I am doing everything I can. I'm just asking you for a little help. Think of something good, man. - Yeah. She's doing checkout, up from bagging. - That's good. - Tremendous. Works for now. She gets a break on pampers. She loves to bake. Wants to go to pastry school, learn to make fancy desserts. Oh, yeah? You got a tummy ache, Hallsy? - Nah. Thanks for your concern. 'Hey, we're done cleaning the car.' - Best we could anyway. - Good. 'Cause I got you a meeting with O'Neill in five minutes. Yeah? Yeah, and I, uh, put in a good word for you. So don't screw it up. Hey. - Yeah, he's dead. So, I hear you're a badass. Facing down, 5-0. Seemed like the right thing to do at the time. Mm-hmm. Shootin' at the police seems kind of stupid if you ask me. Yeah, maybe right now, but not then. Not after Randy got shot. - Yeah, Queens. Best city in the world, baby. Go, Mets. Why'd you leave? I got invited to that party upstate. Six years, armed robbery. After that.. I don't know, seemed like the right time to move on. Unfortunately, there's no one here who can back you up. Nobody here was at Sing Sing. Still, doesn't build confidence now, does it? Look, I'm not getting references while I'm doing my time, okay? You vouch for him? Absolutely. Good. - Hector Corona. Half black, half Dominican, 100% Bronx. His Caribbean connections are wired into Afghan dope. - Met him in the joint. Well, he's got a mole in the feds. He knew about their plan to raid those Mexican boats. Knew they'd take all that dope off the street. And open the market right up. 'Cause it's wide open now, boy. See this? 'They got it all'' Everything the Mexicans had, gone before it hit dry land. There's no smack anywhere. Except for my boy, Hector. You interested? That depends. That.. That depends on what? On whether or not that scumbag Sykes is alive. That scumbag Sykes is dead. Hey, look, I got a problem about my pay grade here, guys. What's that? O'Neill wants me to kill Sykes. If I do, he'll sit down with my heroin connection. That all? Sykes have any warrants, anything at all? Bench warrant. - Two old parking tickets. - Bring him in. - He wants him dead, Carter. Maybe we can hide him for a bit, buy some time. Look, my boy Hallsy, he's getting edgy. - I'm telling you. A civilian who just who saw some kid get shot five times edgy. A civilian? We popped him for selling four keys of coke. Okay, who's talking to you, and what does that mean? - I'm just saying. What're you saying? He's a criminal, not a Sunday-school teacher. He joined the gang in prison, so he wouldn't get raped. - He's scared. He knows I'm a cop. He flips, I'm dead. - That's my point. - Bring him in. Arresting him is a bad idea. Who says we're gonna arrest him? Police! Freeze! Whoa, what I do? What the hell did I do? Aah! You park your DeVille in a handicapped zone? - Time to pay the piper. Clear. Spotless too. I don't buy it. Turn this place upside down. Look, I didn't set anybody up. I never even heard of the Venice Kings. Well, they know you, Sykes. They put a hit on you. - Termites. They killed five people recently. Fellas, ma'am, no. You got me mixed up with somebody else. I'm a financial consultant. I never even.. What the hell are you looking for, brother? Hello? I know what is there to the penny! - Sit down. - Down to the penny! You got no right coming in here, going through my walls. You need a warrant. Fourth Amendment. You want it confiscated? Ill-gotten gains, or walk away with every penny. Up to you? How did you wire up the hit on the Venice Kings today? I didn't wire up jack. Look. Darnell Wallace, runs 28th Street Lokes. Said he'd pay if I told when someone wanted to score smack. He wants a monopoly on the smack trade? - Nothing. It's a ghost town. Now, about my money? You play ball, sit in a cell for a week, then disappear you can keep your cash. - Yeah, right. - So cynical. Makes me kind of sad. Scour the pad for the rest of the dope.. ...then voucher the money. You hear me? Yeah. Alright, lay down. Yo, can I get something to lay down on maybe? That's what you do when you cap somebody? Give him something nice to snuggle up on? I never capped anybody. I'm a businessman. Straight up. How much was in there? How much dough was in the wall? - Well, you counted it. - Not yet. It's gonna take three hours to get through all of that, so.. The real number? Or minus what you're gonna take to make this deal go the way it should? - Lie down. - Easy, tough guy. - Shut up. - $743,000. - I said, "shut up." Shoot him, Ty. Alrighty. Carter wants us to call the morgue and see if they're set to cremate any white John Does. Oh, balls, my man. But this.. - This is A plus plus. - Whoa. Never got an A before. It's sick. Bet I know who did the dirty work and who didn't. No, we did it together. It's ruthless. That's our path, boy. That's how we take this city. Call your connection. Let's get that heroin deal going. Done. Gentlemen, this way. - I don't know. Never seen 'em before. Where's the smack coming from? What do you care, okay? It's from the DA in Sacramento. Better be good, 'cause O'Neill's gonna test it with a gun to the guy's head. - Don't worry. - You say that a lot.. - ...which makes me worry. - The deal goes down, you skate. Back to Sophie, and back to your son. Just make sure your boy's heroin is good. This way. Come on. He's in. In position. I see Dean, Hallsy, Pike and O'Neill. Mr. Corona. The goods? 'This way, my man. Let's get started.' What are you drinking? So, we line sealed packets of.. Thank you. 'Frozen shark carcasses on their way to Miami fish market'' They get waived through customs. Take a little detour. 'Hector Corona gets what's his.' 'The market gets its fish. Simple.' That's incredible. Mind if I take a peek at the other half of this equation? Who else do you do business with? That's confidential. 'What are you a priest or a drug dealer?' Me no speak whatever. That means I'm a little bit of both. He's done business with my friend from Sacramento. - Guy named J.K. Landers. We were in juvenile together. He's a good guy. It's on your name, brother. Forty five percent. That's a good number. To taking over Venice. 'Like I said, man.' Only the best. That's good. Very good. It's done. At the ready. That's the last piece, brother. 'This time tomorrow, we own Venice.' I thought Venice was the Lokes'. They may have a little opinion on that. Well, won't none of them be around to voice their opinion. They'll be gone in a puff of smoke. Keep your eye on the news tomorrow. No. So any place I should stay away from so I.. ...so I stay safe? Stay east of the 405 for the rest of the day. Unless you don't mind getting ash on your silk shirt. You gotta be kidding me. Damn it. What's going on, Carter? Are we going in or not? 'It's a whole lot easier to bust these assholes' with the doors open. Are we moving in or not? No! Abort the arrest! Repeat. Abort the arrest! Why? - There's a bomb. ' Where? That's a hell of a question. I had no choice, Dean. There's a damn bomb out there. Do you have any idea what you're doing? 'You didn't hear O'Neill talking about a bomb?' - He is talking smack, man. 'Then we bust him.' He spent half his life in jail. He doesn't care if he's back . If Hallsy cracks, he's dead, and then they kill me. He made this bomb out out to be something big. - We're talking innocent people. - 'I'm telling you.' I don't know much my boy Hallsy can take of this. Listen to me. You are in until we find this bomb. You hear me? 'If you're nervous, find it fast.' Come on, Jaimie. Let's take a ride. Reel it back a bit, okay? I told you, I don't know where he planted the bomb. Okay, what about the location of the Lokes? No clue. 'Boss.' Here's to the breezes that blows through the trees as it lifts the girls skirts above their kneeses. - Hear. - 'Hear.' 'Why so sour?' Hey, man, I'm worried. I mean, where exactly west of the 405 should we be staying away from? - You'll be fine. You doubting me? No, I'm psyched to be a part of this. I just want to hear an answer, a yes. Here it is, brother. Yes. Two friends of mine flew in from Oregon yesterday and made a little care package for Mr. Darnell Wallace. CEO of the 28th Street, True Blue Lokes. Homeboy will not know what hit his black ass. Your friends gonna stick around for the fireworks? No, they're halfway back to Bend. - To a new day! - New day. You need a lap dance. No, Darnell Wallace didn't have an address. He ain't that stupid. Well, they put a bomb out there, Sykes. Wasn't on a guess. Then they know him better than me. You know what we're gonna do, Jaimie? We are gonna have a little bonfire. Well, good for you. Using all that cash out of your wall. Oh, man, come on. We had a deal! And I got a whole bunch of innocent clean people about to get torn to ribbons. You think I care about your dirty cash? It's a house downtown. The 28th Streeter's call it the armory. Tell me that's just a cute name. No, it's not. It's their armory. So you wear your vest, little girl. - LAPD. - 'Move, freeze.' Police! Don't move! Don't move! Down! I said down! Any of you cats seen two redneck looking dudes around these parts yesterday? Flannel shirt, checkered shirt? That type wouldn't come around here, G. - They wouldn't last. Suitcase behind a water heater. Easy access from outside adjacent to this wall. And now, if it's live.. ...it could take out the whole room. What about a suitcase behind the water heater? You got to be kidding me. - 'Some guns, some coke.' No trace of explosives. Anyone got a location on Darnell Wallace? If they do, they aren't talking. Alright. Communicate that to Dean. Don't these guys know we're in the middle of a damn recession? Geez. How'd everything go with your sister? It went. - Seven large. - Oh-oh. - Yep. But I'm not gonna help her out this time. I can't keep being her crutch, man. Never heard you say that before. I'm saying it now. I heard O'Neill talking. Those rednecks made a pretty big bomb. How big? I don't know for sure, but he said "sometimes you gotta kill the innocent to get the guilty." - I've been thinking. - Oh, come on. Not this again. I want to serve my time. I'd rather do five years than end up in a body bag. - O'Neill's getting nervous. About what? - About you, Hector, me. What makes you say that? He's been trying to get in touch with JK, my friend. So he can ask about Hector. Only problem is, JK don't exist. Sooner or later, he's gonna do the math. And when he does, I'm not going down alone. Are you threatening me? I just want out, okay? It's my right. No, you got no f.. You got no rights. I own you. I own your ass until we make this bust. Do you understand me, Kevin? You understand me? So get it through your head, Kevin. Stay strong and we'll make it through, you understand? And if we make it through, what happens to me? - Life-- I get a pat on my ass and a bull's-eye on my back. - I won't make it three days. - There's a bomb out there. A lot of innocent people are gonna die. The only innocent person I'm worried about dying is me.. ...Dean. He's been locked up 25 of his 40 years. 'Folsom, Pelican Bay, led a gang in San Quentin.' Family? Mother's in a nursing home, but no wife, no kids. I got a note here on a girlfriend. Marcella Vazquez, 25. - 'Clean as a whistle.' Receptionist at some accounting firm in Playa del Rey. We've tried everything, So. What? - Let's grab the girlfriend. Leverage. You got a problem? - She's a secretary. ' Dating a criminal doesn't make you one. You read that in a fortune cookie? This woman didn't do a damn thing. Neither did the innocent people her prick boyfriend's about to kill. And none of them are screwing him. - You're out of bounds, Carter. - Then talk to her nice. Woman to woman. Maybe light some scented candles. Run her a bath. Just get her in here now! - Yeah. You're Carol from the car-broker place. - Carolyn. I love your necklace. - Thanks. It's my grandmother's. Like I said, your boyfriend really wants you to test-drive the car before he pulls the trigger. Makes sense. I can't believe he's buying me a car. You scream, this tape goes back on. Why am I here? - Quiet. Who's this? 'I'm calling on behalf of Darnell Wallace' and the 28 true-blue Loke nation, fool. We got told you looking to do us some harm. 'Aw, you got nothing to worry about.' It's not gonna hurt a bit, Mr. No name. - Think you got tickled. - 'We'll see on that.' You tell us where the bomb's at, G or we put a nice bullet in your pretty little girlfriend's head. Marcella right here, right now. She look fine, too. What the hell are you talking about? 'Smile off your face now, little bitch, huh?' We wanna know where the bomb's at. Because if you don't.. ...Marcella ain't never gonna make it back home. And before she gets to say "what up" to Allah she really gonna know what it's like to love a black man, you cracker boy. Here's your little boyfriend. He dying to hear your voice. Baby 'I'm so scared. Who are the--' Quiet. Quiet! I'm telling you, you hurt her and I'll blow your brains out. 'Then tell us where the bomb at, G?' Tit for tat, homey. Tit for tat. Can-Can you please just take this blindfold off? I'm really claustrophobic. - Shut up. You won't get hurt. - Concerned citizens. I have nothing to do with this. I'm just his girlfriend-- - No. Then shut up. Okay. You just seem like a really nice person. I'm not that nice. Can I, can I just use the bathroom? I'm really nervous. I feel like I'm gonna get sick. That's not how this is gonna work, G. 'Okay? You give her up.' 'And then you get the location of the device.' 'No, I make the rules.' 'I tell you when you get your girl back, right?' You listen to me, you dumb gangster son of a bitch! I know we don't got much time, which sadly for you means Marcella ain't got much time, either. 'What do you know?' 'How do you know how much time you got?' Loke's got eyes everywhere. I told you, we've been doing this for a minute, man. - She's in the bathroom. - C-D-apostrophe-A. What could that mean? California, something. I don't know. You hear the question? Look, I don't know who you guys are or what you want from me, but I don't know anything. - I don't have a clue! Gag her. A-ah! A-ah! Pull your gun out and aim it at her head. - No. - Do it! If she doesn't stop fighting and drop the scissors in two seconds, blow her brains out. One...Two. - Trying to see what she knows since you ain't being very helpful. - She doesn't know anything. - We'll see about that. No, no. Please, no, not that, please. - She's claustrophobic. - Tough. No. Why are you doing this? Because your boyfriend planted a bomb, okay? He's planning on killing innocent people. He started this, not me. No! No! C-D-A. C CD apostrophe A. What does it mean? Wait, wait, wait! I heard him. I heard him on the phone the other day. He mentioned a street Coeur D'Alene. I don't know. Is that it? 'What's that?' Why you discussing turf wars and heroin deals when we about to cut your girl up piece by piece? Look, G, the homies is out searching 'Coeur D'Alene right now, and if they find the bomb' 'before you tell us where it's at' it ain't gonna be good for your girl. 'She gonna be lying in a pool of gasoline.' 'You don't want that.' So give up the info right here, right now. 'She walks away free.' If you don't, it's not a good thing. End of story, game's over. It's in a brown Toyota, 2302. - It's in the trunk. - 20 minutes. You got 20 minutes! - Get out of here. - Go! Go! Grab your families! Run like hell! Come on! Go! Go! Get out! Get out! Take off. Take off. Be careful. Go. Go. - A minute, maybe less. Hoping for something a little bit more encouraging than that. - Most of it. - It means it's time to get the hell out of here. Text Dean. Tell him to grab Hallsy and cut him loose. Then grab Jaimie and bust O'Neill. - Dean, boss's office. Strategy session, Ace. Come on. You're invited. Let's go. What up, Dean? Why don't you have a seat? Do you mind telling me what's going on here? You 5 What? No. You-you're insulting me. I called Darnell Wallace asking when he was gonna deliver Marcella. The Lokes don't know nothing about her getting kidnapped. What does that have to do with us? Someone fed information on the location and the time of the explosion, to whoever I was on the phone with, which had to be 5-0 or how's the bomb squad get there on time? - It's not us. - Well, someone did it. Yeah, and it's got nothing to do with-- Well, it was someone, and he's the only one here puking and crying and callin' his girlfriend and saying he loves her and it's all gonna be over soon. What's gonna be over soon? Hallsy, tell me. What's gonna be over soon? I was just calling her to say hello. I want the truth, damn it! Tell me the truth! What are you looking at him for? 'You are 5' Listen, you're being ridiculous, O'Neill. - Yeah. 'You need to understand 'cause I'm not 5-0.' Well, it's still there. I can't. Listen.. Come on, Hallsy, if he's police, just tell me. Tell me right now, right this second, and I promise you'll get a pass. 'Come on, boy.' Come on. Do yourself a favor and tell me what I already know. - I'm sorry! You're sorry about what, Hallsy? You're sorry about what? You lying sack of.. Oh-h! Hey, could we, uh...could we get a second? You're good to go. I was gonna tell him you're a cop. But you didn't. That's O'Neill's. Always with the black rubber band. No. I found it on the ground. I killed that man today. O'Neill. He's trash. Right down to his bone marrow. So...I'll drink myself to sleep a few nights and move on. Sounds like a good plan. If I'd had to kill that woman Marcella Vasquez... I made a judgment call. It worked. This time. That's all that matters. 350k, courtesy of Venice Kings. Is it all there? 'Or did O'Neill shortchange Mr. Corona?' I hear drug dealers do that sometimes. I wasn't planning on counting it. 'Good night, man.' - 'Hey.' - Hey. You're beautiful. Babe, you want to go out tonight? All I got to do is shower. We're good after that. Unless you want to join me, then we're really good. So, your sister left a message on the home line. She said she tried calling you on the cell but there was no answer. 'Um..' What did she say? She said "thanks." A few times. - Can we talk about this after-- You know what? It's bill night. So I just need to know which one's gonna bounce. - None of 'em. ' You gave her $7,000. She definitely said more than thanks-- I know that she's your sister I know that you love her, but w Babe, we're gonna pay the bills. We're gonna pay the mortgage. And if we want to go eat a big steak tonight - that's what we're gonna do. You told me that people slip when they do bad things for good reasons. Okay, I know what I told you, and I didn't do any of that. How'd you get the money? My bike. Is that why Carter drove you home? Did you sell your motorcycle? Well, I was tired of it scaring you. - I'll meet you in the shower. - Hm.
