 I saw this crazy tranny band last night at the Roxy. Not here to talk about bands or she-males. - Nate will be here soon. What, you got a hot date or something tonight, cutie? Okay, Jaimie, he's about to turn the corner. Black shirt, backpack. 'That's our man passing in the front of you now.' Lift up your shirt. Pants too. Ha-ha-ha. Kidding. Let me see the cash.

 Two 10 stacks, 20 grand. Best stuff north of the border. That's what Ernesto here says. - Good doing business with you. - Alright, brother. Hey, call me anytime for anything. I think he just made me. Yep. I spooked him. - Too many people. - Let it go. That asshole took five shots at me! Let it go. What the hell happened out there? Carter called it off. Too many people. Really? It seemed pretty empty to me.

 It wasn't. Besides, I'm not sure he's worth our time. Worth our time? Carter, the man sold us a kilo of damn-near pure cocaine. We're knocking off early tonight. What're you talk.. What the hell's going on? Not now. I'm meeting a friend. There's something wrong with him. - Insert joke here. - No, I'm serious. D's right. Since when does Carter leave before midnight? Since when does he consider a kilo of cocaine insignificant? Since when does he have a friend? This is creepy. It's like spying on your father or something. Wait. Sh-h. Look at this. Who is this guy? - Not too bad. - He's good. Nicole? She's in Orange County with her mother. Better than her mother being here with you? Eh, you got a point there. What the hell are we really doing here, Carter? - I just wanted to talk. They got some of those spicy...tuna things. You know, I forget what they're called but crispy rice, jalapeno peppers. Remember, D? Last time, I had like 15 of those bad boys. - She's at home chilling. Maybe we should ask her to come with us. Okay. It's settled. Melissa's coming with us.. What the hell are you doing here? That's Nate. That's the drug dealer from this afternoon? You should go. Now. - Carter. - Go. He's a Fed. Undercover D.E.A. You were never here. There's no upside to being here. I promise. 'So go.' Go! Stupid son of a bitch. You alright? D.E.A. is sending someone over to get a statement. We worked together for five years. I still can't believe.. Just get it all sorted out before the investigator gets here. The Feds don't like it too much when one of their own gets shot. You okay? You've been texting back and forth all morning. Something happened last night on the job. Well, can you talk about it? - No. Sorry. - No. I get it. I, uh.. ...just got a text myself from that firm in San Francisco I was telling you about. You mean "the world's most prestigious law firm?" It looks like they're gonna make me an offer. - Of course I can believe it. That's awesome! Oh. So, uh...are you gonna accept? I didn't even think I was gonna get a job. I haven't really been thinking about it. So say yes. 'I want to. But, uh..' ...you know, what about us? - I should get that. - Yeah, sure. Yeah? Okay. Right. I need to get going. Congratulations. Captain. - We ain't heard from Carter. And no one's returning our calls. - He can't talk, you must leave. Go. I'll get you when I need you. Thank you for coming, Agent Harris. Carter, this is Julia Harris, D.E.A. She's heading up the investigation. First off, I'm sorry that you have to go through this. - It's never an easy thing. - Thank you. 'As far as the process, it's simply a conversation.' I have no official legal authority. - You can leave at any time. - Right. But if you do refuse to cooperate take the fifth or retain legal counsel I'm required to contact the U.S. Attorney's office. They're required to open a grand jury investigation. Lawyers, subpoenas, phone records. In other words, things can get very complicated, very fast. Can you tell me what happened last night to the best of your recollection? If you need more time, we can.. No. I'm fine. Two of my men crossed paths with Steve during a routine buy-and-bust operation yesterday. I was working backup, recognized Steve and, uh.. ...called off the bust. You knew Agent Fuller? We worked narcotics together for about five years when he was L.A.P.D. Please continue. 'So, uh..' '...later that day, we talked.' Decided to meet up and share information on our respective cases. He also asked me to go to a meeting with him. He was hooking up with a new contact. He asked you to back him up even though you don't work together anymore? It's not that unusual. Right. So, you do this a lot? You help out detectives in other agencies? A.T.F, F.B.I, Homeland Security? If a friend asks for help, I help. So we met up around 8:30. The meeting went bad. The contact, white male 20's, about 5'10", got nervous.. ...pulled the gun, started shooting. Steve.. ...tackled him. I.. ...returned fire and accidentally.. ...shot Steve. - 'The shooter drove off.' I ran after him. Rushed back to Steve checked his pulse called an ambulance.. ...and here we are. - It was a blue Toyota. Anyone else there? No. Just Steve and me. Anything else I need to know? No. Nothing? You asked me to tell you what happened.. ...and that's exactly what happened. 'Word is she's a gunner.' 'Shocking.' Graduated USC. Made supervisor at 30. Alright, so we got a preliminary report back from the crime-scene guys. They didn't find any shell casings. Besides yours, I mean. It looked like a wheel gun to me. Not going to eject any shells. I also spoke to Agent Fuller's supervisor. 'He's good with procedure, kept a current log.' It's odd that he didn't mention his meeting with you. Odd? To you maybe. Excuse me? - No. Then with all due respect, it's hard to explain. It's not something you learn behind a desk. We weren't able to find any bullet fragments at the scene. It was pretty wide open. The bullets could be anywhere. Sure. But right now, they're nowhere which means, technically, they don't exist. You don't even have to be an undercover cop to follow that. Carter didn't tell you Fuller was undercover D.E.A? No, sir. We thought we were investigating a coke dealer named Nate. Thought it was a routine drug bust until Carter pulled us out, of course. What happened later? Did you know he was meeting Fuller? No, we went our separate ways a little after 8:00, I think. So you have no information regarding the shooting? None. None. - No, sir. - 'Okay.' Until further notice, lay low. No more fieldwork until this is resolved. - Well, hopefully, soon. But the crime-scene guys are having a hard time corroborating Carter's story. At least for now. Why? Well, there's, uh.. ...no shell casings, no bullet fragments, no witnesses. No one saw the son of a bitch who pulled the trigger. Are you telling us it was a third party? 'Apparently.' White male, 20's, drives a blue car. Gunman? Blue car? Is there any way we could've missed that? 'If there was a blue car, we would've seen it.' Great, so he just made it up. No gunshots either. I don't get it. - Same reason anyone lies. The truth ain't pretty. Come on, man. What are you doing-- - L.A.P.D. Argh! - We're cops, Ernesto. We want to know how long you've been setting up deals for Nate. I don't know. Maybe a year. We did like five or six deals. What the hell's going on here, man? Did...you know he was D.E.A.? 'No.' I swear, okay? Everybody knew Nate had the best coca in town, alright? You paid a little extra, but it was good. Anybody get busted after buying from him? No, man. Yeah, I don't get it, Ty. Huh? Why is some big-time narc dealing with some nickel-and-dime Mexican queen, huh? - No offense. - None taken, man. - Yeah. I told them to lay low. How'd they seem? Confused. Like the rest of us. What'd they say? What do you mean? When you told them.. ...what was going on did they seem...surprised? Yeah. And concerned. Believe it or not, I think they actually like you Carter. Last I heard, Fuller was on a task force to bust up a major heroin ring in the valley. In the valley? Any chance he was working coke stings downtown? Doubtful. The heroin thing's a big operation. And he was a senior agent. 'They wouldn't double him up like that. Why?' No. No reason. Just checking the shooting from our angle, you know? I think Carter's pal flipped. So he goes from victim to perp just like that? This guy, Agent Ryan, says that Fuller was assigned to this massive heroin operation in the valley, right? Why the hell's he selling coke downtown? New contact, new case. I don't know. We go ringing corruption bells, D, prematurely.. He had Ernesto set up, what, six Nobody got busted. Does that make sense to you? I thought I told you to lay low. - I need to talk to Carter. 'It's private.' Alright. Follow me. What are you doing here? That D.E.A. agent, Steve Fuller. I think he was dirty. - We looked into it, Carter. He was selling coke for real that night. - You're wrong. He's not dirty. I know him. What the hell are you talking about, Carter? Why wouldn't you tell us he's a D.E.A. agent that you know him? - It's complicated. - Talk slowly. Do me a favor. Give this to a guy named Dino Ramon. He works down at City Hall. Tell him it's from me. City Hall? What the hell are you talking about, Carter? Just do it. Alright? Harris is back. She wants to talk. I hope you know what you're doing. Sorry, we're late. I just learned that Agent Fuller was engaged to your ex-wife. Seems like something you might've mentioned earlier. It's a pretty big coincidence, don't you think? Out of all the people in the world you shoot a guy who happens to be engaged to your ex-wife. How long were you married? How's that relevant to what happened last night? You worked homicide for four years? Five. You don't think the fact that you shot your ex-wife's fiance is relevant? - Correct. - Fine, indulge me. Help me understand why it's so unimportant. How long were you married? Eight years. - 18 months ago. I don't know. - Irreconcilable differences. Can you be more specific? We...had...issues. Did it bother you that Agent Fuller was having an affair with her while you were still married? As I stated before Agent Fuller's contact got nervous, pulled a gun and started shooting. I returned fire and accidentally shot Agent Fuller. Your ex-wife has arrived. Hopefully she'll be more forthcoming. I want to see her. I spoke with her this morning. She doesn't want to see you or talk to you. I promise. Was Lieutenant Shaw upset when he found out that you and Steve were having an affair? No, he said that he was happy for me. Steve was a great guy. Did you and Carter break up because of your relationship with Steve? No. When Steve and I.. ...when we became friends.. ...my marriage, my relationship was over. What do you mean? Is this really connected to Steve's shooting? You said that when you and Steve became friends your relationship with Carter was over. Look, Carter was working undercover on a big drug operation. He was living in East L.A. under the name Leo Clark. He pretended he was a gangster with drug connections in Colombia. He became a different person. It's like he became...this guy, Leo. And he started a whole new life. And family. A family? Yeah, he was living, uh.. ...with this woman named Anna. She had two young boys. For how long? 'Two years.' He just bounced back and forth. I didn't know about them. They didn't know about me. When's the last time you spoke with Carter? Like a month ago. He called to congratulate me on my new baby. Steve and I, uh.. ...we have a new son. Six months. He said he was thrilled that I was finally happy. You talk about anything else? I asked him to sign the divorce agreement for the 20th time. Wait, you're not officially divorced? No. No, that's why Steve and I never got married. Carter would never sign the divorce agreement. Do you think that he still loves you? The more I learn about you, the more intrigued I become. Really? I'll take that as a compliment. It wasn't meant as one. 'Can I be honest?' I think your story's crap. There was no gunman. No blue car. It was just you and Steve. You got in a fight, an argument. Then you shot him. Because you still love Nicole. Wasn't that a nice little story? I wanna talk to Carter's team first thing in the morning. I'll try to track them down. Sorry? They work undercover. It's not so simple-- Would you prefer if I called the chief? Asked him to get involved? Spoke to him this morning. He's obviously very concerned. He told me to call him if I need any help. I'll see what I can do. Captain? I know you like Lieutenant Shaw. And that you respect Lieutenant Shaw. Your point? Do you trust Lieutenant Shaw? Yes. So he was engaged to Carter's ex Wow. Okay. So now what? The lead investigator wants to talk to you three. - 'Tomorrow.' You'll be suspended without pay until the matter is resolved. Don't be a hero, son. Talk to the woman, tell her what you know, and move on. Should I look for a new job or something? I'm saying you need to talk to Agent Harris first thing tomorrow. What do we say to this Agent Harris? If we tell the truth, Carter's dead. - And so are we. " We left the crime scene remember, Ty? We just told Captain Maynard we didn't see a damn thing. We can get around that. We tell Maynard we needed time to figure things out. We wanted to talk to the union rep. He'll understand. We got nervous. Yeah, okay, maybe, but what about Carter? That's not our problem, man. What, so it's like that? You know how I feel about Carter, D. I feel the same as you. It's not easy, man, to risk your entire career. You're talking about risking your entire career for someone when you don't even know what the hell really happened. What you saying? You don't think it was a clean shoot? I don't know! What if he and Fuller got into some alpha-dog jealousy crap over Nicole? Come on, does that sound like Carter to you? Okay. No. As long as we, the three of us, are on the same page we're gonna be fine. - Whatever page we decide. Majority rules, right? Sound right? Okay, so if Ty and I want to tell the truth the real truth, you're on board? Like I said, majority rules. I told you to stay out of it. So I've to meet with that Agent Harris tomorrow. - Ty and Jaimie too. - So talk to her. - The truth. Which is what? That you don't know a damn thing. That you weren't there. If you tell her exactly what happened, it'll stay with you. It'll follow you, your whole career. "Dean Bendis? Yeah. I know who he is. That punk who was involved in that D.E.A. shooting way back." Why'd you say there was a gunman? Or a blue car? That's what happened. I was there, remember? You weren't. Remember? I appreciate you coming down here, Dean but stay out of it. For your own sake. I gave your cash to your buddy, uh, Dino, down at City Hall. He said everything's set up. - No. Carter? Was it a clean shoot? Yes. Get the hell out of here. Everything okay? Yeah, I think so. I have to go down to the station tomorrow and answer a few questions. But I think it's just a formality. You don't know anything, do you? No. There was a message on the machine. Some guy from Major Crimes called. You sure? - No. Yeah, he said he heard you were looking for a new assignment. He heard I was looking for a new assignment, that's strange. Well, who cares how he found out. The point is...he called. So, is it an official criminal investigation? No. It's still informal, I think. I-I don't know. I don't know anything right now about Carter, my job, us. Hey, whoa. Easy, okay? Look, first things first.. ...the investigation. So, they're gonna ask you a bunch of questions. What do you know? What did you see? Has Carter been acting strange lately? If you only knew how ridiculous that last question was. Yeah. He's kind of a jerk, huh? But not in a bad way. The truth is, he's a pretty decent loyal guy. That's great, but do not let that color your answers. - Just tell the truth. It's not that simple. Carter's problems have nothing to do with you, okay? If he did something stupid, that's on him. Yeah, but-- Lying to a federal agent is not a great career move. You're right. Now.. ...as for us.. ...how would you like to move to San Francisco with me? - Sourdough bread. Great Chinese food, fog. My whole life is here. They've got a police department in San Francisco, too. And you know, everything that's going on with your boss it kind of seems like a good time to transfer or quit. And do what? I don't know. But, you know, you've been talking about wanting to go back to school. And, uh.. ...I'm gonna be making some decent money for once. So why not take advantage of it? I mean, that's as long as you can stand being a kept woman. Sounds pretty good. The The whole thing. I got to be honest with you. Nothing you've said has panned out. There's no evidence to back up your story. Still no shell casings, no bullet fragments car tracks, witnesses. I'm sure you'll find something Oh, I already have. Motive. Motive? Love. 'Jealousy.' Revenge. I'm way too jaded to kill someone over something as stupid as love. Agent Fuller was part of a major heroin operation. The last thing my bosses want is a trial where Fuller's identity is exposed post-mortem compromising 13 months of hard work. Yeah, that'd be a real shame, huh? You know what? Let's just cut through the horseshit, alright? Make things a whole lot easier for both of us. Your chief already sold you out, said you were a cowboy. That's supposed to surprise me? What I'm saying is, my bosses want me to bury you 'and your boss is okay with that.' But know what? Despite everything.. ...your story, your relationship with your ex-wife. I just don't think you're a killer. I'm not. Then if there's something else going on, tell me now 'cause things are about to get real complicated. I don't have anything else to say. Just talked to Carter. And...it's worse than I thought. What do you mean? I think they're trying to indict him. - Looks that way. So we're gonna need to get creative. - He's at home. Is he on board with all this creativity? Who cares? As long as you and I are on the same page majority rules, right? So? I don't know. Scott got a job offer in San Francisco and he wants me to go with him. I don't want to jeopardize that. Is that your reason? We have to think about ourselves, not Carter. It's just that easy for you, huh I'm not gonna hang myself for his lies or yours. Come on. You know what's funny? The two people you're calling liars. are the two people who actually know who you are. And still like you for it. There was a picture in here of the view. You could see the top of the Golden Gate Bridge. Hey! What's wrong? Nothing. You're worried about your meeting with the D.E.A. agent? Look, you know what? Like I said. You just tell the truth, about everything. You do that, and there's nothing that anyone can do to you. Ever. My name's not Jaimie Allen. Excuse me? My name's Jaimie Anderson. I changed it when I moved to L.A. I'm from Detroit, not New Jersey. - No. I've been lying to you ever since we met. About my past, that is. And I-I am sorry. Wait-wait. Hold on. So, y No, uh, I-I am. But I was someone different before. Someone that you wouldn't have liked. Wait, w-what the hell does that mean? I don't know, it, this is not a simple conversation. I-I promise you that I will answer your questions over time. But for right now, I just need to know that you understand what I'm saying. I do. I mean, I-I, at least, I think that I do. That our whole relationship is a lie. No. No. I know that this sounds ridiculous, but I do love you. It sounds ridiculous, okay? Ty? Can I call you back in a minute? I'll be right there. - I-I have to go. - Yeah, no. - I have to meet.. - That's great, no problem. Roger that. Hey, we got to roll. Captain's got a flat tire four blocks from here. So that's it, right? We're together on this. You and me, sister. Are we cowards? No. 'Not if we think, it's the right thing to do.' 'If you ask me..' ...we're smart. - Goodnight, Jaimie. - Goodnight. You have an impressive record. Straight A's in the academy. Thank you, ma'am. Agent Harris is fine. Did my friend from Major Crimes contact you? Yes, he did. Thank you, Agent Harris, for that. Now, tell me.. ...what happened after you made the buy with Agent Fuller? After we made the buy from Agent Fuller, uh Lieutenant Shaw pulled us back from making the arrest. Did he inform you that Fuller was D.E.A.? - No, he didn't. After the aborted bust, we followed Lieutenant Shaw to what we thought was another buy attempt with Agent Fuller. You followed Lieutenant Shaw to the site of the shooting? Yes. We knew he had a meeting. We were a little concerned. Of course, he wasn't aware of it. What did you see? Uh, Carter and Agent Fuller were talking for a few minutes and then a-a car pulled up. I heard two gunshots, and then, I don't know a couple of seconds later I heard a third. After that, we saw a blue car take off from the crime scene. We gave chase, but.. Your unit's very loyal. What does that mean? They corroborated your story. Blue car, gunshots.. And the crime-scene guys extracted two .38 slugs from the hillside. That your way of saying the case is closed? Something like that. Congratulations. That mean I still have a job? Means we both still have jobs. So tell me.. ...what really happened out there? I told you. It's complicated. So, uh.. ...won't you tell me what really happened? Steve was dirty. I went there to straighten his ass out. He's got responsibilities, you know? A woman who loves him, a baby son. He thought I was trying to set him up. Which couldn't be further from the truth. We got into it, got physical, he pulled his gun. I swear to God, Dean, I thought he was gonna kill me. I didn't have a choice. I shot him. Why lie? Why not tell the feds what you just told me? Nicole. You're trying to protect his legacy for your ex - Come on, Carter. - 'Steve was a good guy.' He really was. He just.. ...he flipped. He got dirty. It could happen to anyone. Oh, and in case, you didn't know.. '..I told Maynard everything.' 'He didn't blink.' He's got your back. Nicole, I'm sorry. It was a terrible accident. Right. What's that? Our divorce agreement. Now? There's something else in here, too. Marriage certificate. A friend of mine down at City Hall.. ...took care of it'' 'You and Steve were married eight months ago.' He just forgot to notify the D.E.A. You're entitled to full benefits. Thanks, bro. Hey, there he is. - We're drinking your scotch. What are you doing here? I came to.. - Oh-ho-ho! - Ah. - I came for the real stuff. - You gotta tell me twice. Here, throw me some. - Okay, now hook a brother up. - Yeah, yeah. Don't leave me out. - There you go. - Tsk, tsk. Hey, there she is. I left my bag. Yeah, when are you and Scott heading to San Francisco? Uh, we're not. He is. I told him I still had some stuff to do down here. Cool. First up, grab a seat, have a drink with the boys. - Eh. - 'No, no, no.' Sit your butt down. Have a drink. Come on. You know, I hate toasts. - Hah! - Big surprise. But, uh.. Seriously. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. There's a party. Damn, that's good. Just keep pouring. Just keep pouring.
