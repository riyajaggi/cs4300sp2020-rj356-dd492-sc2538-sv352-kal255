 My name is Danny McNamara. When I left the FBI, I thought my crime-fighting days were over, but then I learned that terrorist Karim Farouk was on the hunt for Cleopatra, one of the world's most valuable treasures, lost for over 2,000 years, to use her as part of a massive terror attack. To find him, I needed some help, so I went to Lexi Vaziri, a thief. Excuse me, a master thief. And my father was killed by Farouk.

 Lexi and I have a complicated past. He wants to bring Farouk to justice, I want revenge. Also, there's a mysterious group who want Cleopatra as much as we do. We're not sure whether they're good or bad, but the one thing we all agree on... Is that we need to find Cleopatra... Before Farouk does. Previously on Blood & Treasure... Fabi. You're in the Brotherhood of Serapis. And you, Lexi, can be a part of it. I can't do this without Danny. And if you tell him, you will both be dead. The only way you survive

 is working with us. - Where's Shaw? - In there. Shaw's escaped again. Crate's here, but no Cleopatra. It's a Casablanca regiment. So they went to Casablanca. You two destroyed my bazaar. I lost millions. You know, I've been very much looking forward to killing you. No! Luca... Interpol is all over what happened there. Agent Karlsson suspects your involvement and she is not pleased. You should get out of here now, because she's coming for you. Came across an old list of names. Former members at some time or other. One of the names kind of stuck out. Vaziri? I'd say your father was in the Brotherhood of Serapis. What? _ - Lieutenant Heinz. - What took so long? There's a bounty on us. _ The boat leaves with or without us. We have less than one hour to catch it. Get to work. Salaam alaikum. _ _ _ _ _ _ I'm pretty sure I already know the answer to this, but have you seen Casablanca... the movie? Yeah, of course I have. Name one character. - Joe. - Nice try. Oh, come on. It's an old movie, there's not one Joe? You know, you'd like it. It's got it all. Love, danger, rebellion. When this whole thing's over, we're doing a movie night. So after we catch Farouk, you're not going back to America? I haven't really thought that far ahead. Well, feel free to think it over when you check us in. Are you in Casablanca? Yes. We're very close to finding Cleopatra, but I have a question for you. Were you ever gonna tell me my father was in the Brotherhood? Where did you hear that? I'm asking the questions now. If you don't want me to keep secrets from you, don't keep any from me. Simon Hardwick. You need a better source. So it's not true? No. Now please focus. We lost track of Farouk's men when they fled Spain. They could be on your tail. I highly doubt it. They missed the trail that the Nazis took Cleopatra here. We're completely off their radar and ahead of Farouk for once. Well, you have a way of putting yourself on the radar. I take that as a compliment. You shouldn't. - What's up? - The card was declined. It's Reece's. There's, like, a bajillion-dollar limit on it. I think we've been Red Noticed by Interpol for the shoot-out in Spain. Our assets are frozen. There's some money on the plane, in Reece's safe. He has a safe? Under the first chair on the left. Have you been... Never mind. They've probably impounded Reece's jet, and our passports will be revoked if they haven't already been. If they find us they're gonna arrest us. Your pal Gwen couldn't have given you a heads-up? Pretty sure she's the one who filed it. Gwen, as per usual, can suck it. I'm not leaving until we find Cleopatra. Agreed. We should go to the port authority, see if they have any records of the Nazis coming in. We just need to get off the grid. It's too late. Moroccan police. Follow me. I told you I'd catch up with you. Danny? I knew you'd come out this way. You were told not to leave the EU without permission. And you did, leaving a pile of bodies in Spain. Gwen, we are so close to finding Cleopatra. We're actually ahead of Farouk. I don't care. You are going to pay for the murder of my son Luca. You asked for this. Aah! Danny. Carlo's here. Where are we gonna go? We hardly have any cash on us. - Can't you just call Reece? - No, I already pulled the SIM card out of my phone. That's probably how Gwen found us. Walk this way. Come on. Oh, that doesn't look too good. Oh, I've had worse. Right now, we have to get off the streets, before our faces are plastered all over town. Do you smell lamb? What? Someone's cooking lamb. Perfect. No one's gonna look for us here. _ You look lost. U-Um, no. No, sorry. We were just... Whatever is outside that wall is not my business. You are welcome to stay here. This is a refugee camp. It's a sanctuary for people who have nowhere else to go. Follow me, please. _ We do what we can to give them some normalcy. Like sports, school, counseling. Our resources are limited, but we never turn away a guest in need. No, please. You can thank us later, when you can spare it. Excuse me. _ Is this how you and your brother honor your cousin? My murdered son? This is about the honor of our family. Find them... The treasure hunters and the terrorists... And kill them all. I will do it, Tio Carlo. Good morning. Morning. Good tea. It's my first try. Excuse me. Look at this. _ I have been told that the camp is going to be searched today. You won't be safe here anymore. Thanks. We've got to get out of here. Come back for Cleopatra once the chaos has died down. You see that? Look at her necklace. Cleopatra and Antony's sigil. It was on the relics at the black market bazaar. So whoever made that design had had contact with Cleopatra's sarcophagus? Exactly. Sit down. Let me look at that. - It's infected. - You speak English. I studied at the University of Damascus, before the war in Syria. That's where most of the people in this camp come from. - How long have you been here? - A year. I'm trying to save enough money to travel to Oslo. That's where my husband and son are. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I heard you talking about my necklace. Yeah, it's a fascinating design. Where did you get it? Lazlo's Jewelry Shop in the Old Medina. I work there part-time. It's a popular item. No other store carries it. We're interested in meeting whoever designed it. The shop has been selling them for years, well before I started working there. Well, maybe you could connect us with the shop owner? The shop owner is not a good person. I'm sorry. I can't help you. Change the dressing every six hours. _ _ Aya. Aya. We need your help. Did you hear about the terrorist attack on the pyramid? Of course. Well, the information we are looking for can stop the next attack from happening. We have a feeling your boss may be able to help. You're from Syria. I'm from Egypt. We both have seen destruction. We've both lost people we love. All we want is to stop the same thing from happening to somebody else. The man you're looking for is Salim Le Mer. He's very powerful. - He must not know I told you. - I understand. We will protect you from him, you have my word. Where can we find him? Hello. I'm calling about the reward. Agent Karlsson, I presume? Ramin Hamza, chief of police. Where can I set up shop? Please, you are our guest. - How about some tea? - We have too much work to do. We don't have time for tea. Where are you in your search for Danny and Lexi? I have ordered checkpoints in every district in Morocco. No one will come or go without having to go past my officers. The entire country is on high alert. When Mr. McNamara and Ms. Vaziri surface... They will be found. I don't think the world will end because Gwen Karlsson had an unscheduled cup of tea. So you want us to wait? Hey. They've been spotted. That must be Le Mer's office. Yup. Okay. I've got this one. _ _ _ _ _ Get lost. Uh... Nailed it. Let's take a minute, figure out what to do. _ _ So... we can't get out of the city, can't find Cleopatra, Farouk is still out there. We got cops trying to arrest us and mobsters trying to kill us. I'm all out of ideas. You? Is that Shaw? Of all the gin joints... Oh, no. Hustling cougars, Shaw? These ladies come here for a little adventure in their humdrum lives, and I give them the full Casablanca. I don't even want to know what that means. I mean the experience. And considering I just got my life back together after you two blew it up... I saved your life. Twice. And nearly got me killed. Three times. So move along, before you ruin everything again. Absolutely, soon as we get a meeting with Salim Le Mer. What's your relationship with him? We have an arrangement. I bring a fantasy experience to his customers, and he helps himself to a reasonable cut. So he's your pimp? No. Wait... No. Doesn't matter. We need to meet with La Mer. Make it happen, we'll get out of your hair. No. You two smell like trash right now. As in you literally been rolling around in the garbage. We think Cleopatra is in Casablanca. Yeah, yeah, I heard that noise before. But what you haven't heard is that the Egyptians and Reece are now offering a handsome finder's fee. - Say what now? - Mm-hmm. Which means when we find her, Le Mer is gonna get real pissed knowing you're the reason he didn't get a piece of the action. All right. But let's get you two cleaned up first. Oh... Can I ask you something? Would it matter if I said no? What do you see in Danny, anyway? He's a nice dude and all, but at his core... He's a house cat. But you got tiger energy. You need another tiger. Hmm, let me guess... You're the other tiger. I can't be the only one to notice that our chemistry is off the charts. That's because it's nonexistent. Damn, girl. Pure tiger. We both know you two are never gonna work. What do you think's gonna happen when the law catches up to you? I mean, Danny... He'll get a slap on the wrist. But you... With your rap sheet... You got to start thinking about your future. Hmm. I'm proposing a merger. That's the worst line I've ever heard. A business merger. Soon as I get my Cleopatra money, I'm out. In fact, I'm making arrangements as we speak. You're invited to join me. We'll keep it just business, but you'll be in business with a tiger... Not a cat. Think about it. You ready? What'd I miss? Oh, nothing. Whoever you are, I can assure you there's no need to get rough. I'm a great advocate of diplomacy. I'll tell you whatever you need to know. But also, there's nothing that you can do to me that hasn't been done already. Where did you get this? I seduced a tycoon who deals in blood antiquities. Her name is Jessica Wong. She lives in London. England. I could give you her phone number... So you stole it? I give generously, so I take generously. What are you after? Legitimacy. But I'll settle for loads of money. You see how forthcoming I am? You ask me what you need to know, and if it's within my power, I will tell you. You've been talking to Lexi Vaziri. Filling her head with lies. What is your interest in her? Personally or professionally? Personally, I find her mesmerizing. Professionally, I'm betting she'll be the first person to find Cleopatra, so if I aid her in that quest, perhaps I can share in the windfall. I can sing like a canary all night, only... I don't suppose you got, like, a mineral water or something? If I'm being really honest, like, a gin a tonic would really hit the spot right now. Mr. Le Mer. These are the people I messaged you about. Carlo Velardi... Has a bounty on their heads. How much? One million. Damn. A million. What our associate means is... We can offer you more. Oh? I'm currently in negotiation with Carlo for double that, so... You have precisely two minutes to convince me you can get me more. There is a necklace that's only sold at your shop. That design is part of an ancient artifact. An artifact that we believe is somewhere here in Casablanca. Tell him about the reward money. Oh... If you can tell us who designed it, we can find it. You'll get a significant finder's fee, courtesy of the Egyptian government. Tens of millions. All legal. No headaches. Hmm. If you'll excuse me, my next set is about to start. I'm sending some of my men with you. If I find that this is, uh... A waste of my time... None of you will escape Casablanca. Salaam. We were sent by Le Mer. Ah. Hmm. Mr. Le Mer honors us with his guests. What brings you here tonight? Do you recognize this necklace? - Mm-hmm. - It's an eagle. Wings spread with hieroglyphs. Yes. It's from my mother's shop. The one Le Mer took... Uh... bought. Bought from us. - Do you know who designed it? - I did. My father Hassan was enamored with the design. To honor his memory, I made it into jewelry. Oh, oh... Can't you see my man's wheels are turning? My father and his brother Salim. When was this picture taken? The year they died. 1945. That's an interesting coincidence. Do you know when your father first saw this design? I don't know where, but I remember when. He and my uncle came home late from the ports. I couldn't sleep. Not with all the noise downstairs. What noise? Construction. They work through the nights. And in the morning, I saw this counter. After that night... They had changed. They began to fight all the time. A few weeks later, they killed each other, and nobody knew why. Like they were cursed. In 1945, some Nazis escaped Europe through Casablanca. They brought with them an ancient object they believed to contain immense power. On the night your father and uncle built this counter, I believe it was to conceal that object. They must have planned to hide it away until the heat died down - so they could sell it later. - Nobody move! Gwen. She's here. Cleopatra? Yeah. Look, i-if I'm wrong, you can take us in. I just need to borrow your shotgun. Let's tear this thing apart. Damn it. - It's just the outer sarcophagus. - What does that mean? Egyptian sarcophagi had multiple layers, like Russian nesting dolls. This is just the outer casing. She's still out there somewhere. Of course. Her father and uncle saw no value in keeping the coffin, so they let the Nazis leave with her and kept the gold casing for themselves. Okay, we need to lock this place down. Now. Wait, if-if Farouk thinks we've found Cleopatra, he'll send someone for her. He doesn't know the sarcophagus is empty. - So you want this news to get out? - No. I want us to leak it so it reaches an audience of one. This is one of Le Mer's properties seized by the police, so the two of you can stay here for the night. - Where's Le Mer? - In jail. His men turned on him. Oh, I could get used to this. There are officers stationed outside. If it was up to me, the two of you would be in a holding cell. But... Chief Hamza... Is big on hospitality. I will send for you in the morning, and let's see if Farouk has taken the bait. In the meantime, stay out of trouble. Gwen. Thanks. She still mad I kicked her ass? Mm, seemed like a draw to me. - What are you doing? - It's a stash house. I'm looking for his stash. Guys like Le Mer always have rainy-day money hidden away somewhere. I'm sure they've already swept the place. Le Mer sure knows how to live. Today, we brought down a local kingpin. Maybe tomorrow we catch Farouk. Not a bad day. Here's looking at you, kid. I... You know, watched some clips online. Hmm. Hmm. Thought you got lost in there. What's that? Le Mer's secret stash. You got to be kidding me. Nope. Told you I'd find it. - That's a lot of cash. - Mm-hmm. Go a long way in Belize. Thailand. Boracay. Maldives. - You know we can't keep this. - I know. Can't we just daydream for a minute? Hey. If you could go anywhere... Be with anyone, do anything... Where would you go? You want the truth? I'd expect nothing less from Danny McNamara. No place I'd rather be. You're drunk. I'm buzzed. But it's still true. My dad... Always said we were right for each other. On good days, I agree. And the bad ones? I wonder if we're more like... Mark Antony and Cleopatra. Star-crossed. Doomed. Cursed. Oh, that's a bit dramatic. Need I run through our history? You know... You know, we're not the same people we were when we first met. So who are we? Was that a really bad idea? I don't know. I feel pretty good about it. You? What if it works? The sting to catch Farouk. What does tomorrow look like? Or the day after. Well... I've had some time to think about it. Oh. I... still got my law practice in New York. - Mm. - My... tiny apartment. I guess I could find a larger apartment, big enough for two. I do like New York. I've never actually had a job. Would I be your... Secretary? You'd be a terrible secretary. Hey! What about you? What's... Tomorrow look like? Well, I've never been much for planning. And right now, I'm going for a swim. _ Here we are. Casablanca is three hours to the south. My man on the Moroccan Police Force says that's where your Cleopatra was found. Here. Pleasure doing business with you. You said you'd have a car to take you - the rest of the way. - I do. Get out. Whoa. _ Okay, okay. Hey! Why do you have a burner phone? Are you going through my stuff? You've been spying on me. No. No, it's not like that. I just read a play-by-play of the last 72 hours. You're working behind my back with somebody else. Who is it? I... I can't tell you. But I'd appreciate a little trust. We're supposed to be partners. Looks like you already have one. What I have are sources and assets. Which am I? Come on. Who are you working with? Don't interrogate me, Danny. I'm not your C.I. anymore. - Is it Simon Hardwick? - Oh, I see. - You think very highly of me. - Can you blame me? Just last night you said we're not the same people we were when we met. Well, maybe I never really knew who you were. - Then what are we? - What we've always been. A mistake. I don't trust you to be a part of this sting. You're staying here. _ Where's Lexi? She's a liability. I made the call to leave her behind at the house. Good. Welcome back. You still think they're coming? We found a smuggler outside Tangier who was able to ID Omar. They left him there for dead. That's him. That's Omar. You can't even see his face. That burn. We gave it to him. For Carlo Velardi. Police! You are under arrest! Hey! You're under arrest. Where's Lexi? She was right behind me. Where you taking Omar? To Rome. See if we can squeeze him to flip on Farouk. Thanks to you. I'm sorry for all the trouble. Can you do me one last favor? Depends. Can you trace this for me? It's one of Lexi's underworld contacts she's been texting with. I found the number on her burner phone. See what I can do. I'm sorry, Danny. Don't be. It's for the best. - Not about her. - Whoa, whoa. - Thought we were good. - Yeah, we're good. But the FBI wants to talk to you. I have orders to take you back to Rome under armed guard. They didn't tell me anything else. Grazie, amico. What for? For capturing my son's killer. I'm sorry to have blamed you. The bounty is off. In fact, you're under my protection now, so come on. Cheer up. Who knows... This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. This has been a very strange day. Uh... uh, who are you? I am Aya. "This is my friend Aya. "Take her to her family in Oslo. "I trust you will do this because if you don't, "I will hunt you down and kill you. "Till next time." Tigers got to be tigers. Let's get out of here. Looks like it's just you and me. I'm Shaw. Nice to meet you. _ Where'd you find her? I didn't. She turned herself in. Fabi, what did you learn from your interrogation? Hardwick is just another treasure hunter. I let him go. He knows better than to stick his nose where it doesn't belong. And the girl... Does she know the truth about her father's death? No. Nor will she.
