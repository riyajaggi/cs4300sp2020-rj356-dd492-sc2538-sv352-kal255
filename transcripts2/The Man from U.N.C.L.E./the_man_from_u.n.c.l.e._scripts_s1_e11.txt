And then the propellant shoots the chemical fungus into the air... and the air currents wash the fungus over the Russian wheat fields. That's it, huh? The grain shrivels and twists as if it were burning. The whole harvest turns to ash. Hmm. It's so simple, just like a little toy. Now, I've seen the damage this toy can do. Petkof, Vorensk, Balograd.

 Each missile timed to infect the wheat just as it ripens. The next fields to ripen are at Orbesk. Where I must be tomorrow. Well, I would imagine that our Russian friends are getting a trifle irked by now. One more missile falling on Russian soil will trigger off instant retaliation. - Then counter retaliation... - Now, wait. Are you sure these missiles are coming from America? Oh, Napoleon. The trajectory pattern proves that every missile was fired... within a 50-mile radius of here. Then the casing: Ferrous palladium, American. The propellant: Trianide trioxy salicitate-G, American. The booster coupling: American. Well, then, here's another American product.

 Dr. Jonas Lavimore. I thought he died, uh, five, six years ago. Oh, no. Lavimore involuntarily and bitterly retired. He was forced out of the university by people who thought his research too radical. This strain of fungus is one of Lavimore's discoveries. Until last month, Lavimore was here on the West Coast in Southport. Unfortunately, he's disappeared again. Well, I think I'll take a little sailing trip down the coast to California. How long do I have to find Dr. Lavimore and the missile? The harvest at Orbesk will be ready on the 20th. The fungus loses its effectiveness after 72 hours. That puts the firing at the 18th. Oh, exactly three days. Gee, that's a relief. I thought it was going to be a rush job. Mr. Solo. Mr. Solo. Harvey. Harvey Muller. Harvey Muller, you are such a doll. All right, Mr. Solo. How did I do? Admirably. There are certain aspects of Harvey Muller's unattractive personality... that your mind seems to grasp immediately. Hmm. When you drop anchor in Southport Harbor... you will be Harvey Muller of Drako, Kansas. Wheat-grower, rich, spoiled, with a native brightness. Interests: wheat and women, in that order. Well, in that order I can't be too bright. In case of duress, in case you're captured or questioned... we'll prepare a phrase, a short phrase you can repeat. The instant you repeat this phrase your mind will be unshakably locked... into the personality of Harvey Muller for a period of hours. Well, let's see. What about, um: - "Goodbye, Harvey Muller"? - Fine. [SIGHS] Open Channel D. [RADIO BEEPING] Channel D is open. The subject: Fish floating all around me. Belly-up. Dead as... Well, you name it. Mackerel. I presume there's more, Mr. Solo. Odd note department: Fish seem to have been fried... by something very warm, like the blast from a rocket, perhaps. - Shall I check with Ichthyology? - Yes. Check with Ichthyology. See what might've fried the fish. What do you hear from Illya? The entire Orbesk coast is manned. On red alert. Hmm. Well, if any more containers float ashore... we may be hearing some very loud and destructive noises. [LIGHT BULB BREAKS] [SIGHS] My sun lamp popped. Well, thank you, Heather. That takes a considerable load off my mind. Over and out. [THUD] [BOAT CREAKING] MAN: Ahoy there, in the water. Hang on, we'll tow you in. Ha. Oh, much obliged. Much obliged. That was the prettiest life preserver... a man going down for the third time ever spied. Mrs. Muller's boy, Harvey. Much obliged to you, man. Gabe Melcroft. - Do you know that man? - Huh? No, no, no, no. Frank, bed him down right there... with the blanket until the ambulance gets here. Gabe. Mr. Muller? How did you happen to fall in? - Well, the fact is neither of us fell in. - You didn't? Then how in the world...? No. I jumped in after I saw that man come popping up out of the water. How's that? Fact. Fact. The doggonedest thing I ever saw in my life. Oh, incidentally, what happened to that little boat of mine? Oh, uh, she'll be all right. She'll probably drift aground off the point. - Oh, yeah. GABE: You were saying? What? Oh, yeah. Well, you see, there's bubbles out there. Like all the bicarbonated soda you ever saw. And all of a sudden, whooshing up... Uh, yeah, Uh, Mr. Muller you're gonna catch cold in those wet clothes. Right smack-dab in the middle of these bubbles was this fella... - The man could use a cup of hot coffee. FELICIA: Okay, right away. Here, this'll do you a lot of good, Mr. Muller. - Yeah. Good thing. - Excuse me. Orville? This is Gabe. I wanna talk to him right away. Well, get him. This is urgent. I'll hang on. Huh. You know, Mr. Muller, I was just thinking. Bubbles, people popping out of the water like porpoises... Ha, ha. Fella could easily get himself laughed at, telling a story like that. Ha-ha-ha. Hold it a darn minute, Gabe. It's the truth. I saw it happen with my own eyes. I wish I had a plug nickel for every summer visitor... who's seen mermaids and sea serpents with his own eyes. Ha-ha-ha. Hello? Hello. [QUIETLY] Uh, Gabe here, sir... [BANG ON DOOR] You're trying to tell me I'm seeing things? Mr. Muller, there have been times when I've been pretty confused myself. Felicia will be right up with the hot coffee. Now, Gabe. GABE [OVER RADIO]: It can only mean one thing, Mr. Lockridge. In my opinion... LOCKRIDGE [OVER PHONE]: I'm aware what it means. The question right now is what about the castaway you picked up? Oh, there's nothing to worry about there, sir. [OVER RADIO] Alfalfa type. Uh, not very bright. I've got him buffaloed into believing... - Here, Mr. Muller, this'll warm you up. - I'm much obliged, young lady. But I'm plenty warm right now under the collar. - What? - I've seen some all-fired... unpleasant customers in my day but that one's the all-firedest. Gabe? But what did he do? Just about as much as called me a fool, walleyed, dreamer, hysterical. - Gabe did? - The cocksure young pup. - Mr. Muller... - I think that trick captain's cap... he's wearing in there is shutting off the blood supply to his brain. - Oh, Mr. Muller, I found some clothes. - Gabe, dear, I'm going to run along now. Oh, and promise me that after we're married you won't wear that silly cap anymore. Why not? Well, I wouldn't want you to get anemia of the brain. - Well, what brought that on? - Why, just female talk, I'd say. Well, uh, you can use the shack to change into these dry clothes if you like. Oh, yeah. Well, that's good. I'd like that fine. Ah. Where'd my friend go? Oh, uh, his wife showed up and took him off to the hospital. - Oh. - Your sloop's been picked up. It's berthed at the marina. Good, good. Gabe, I wanna thank you a lot. - You've been a mighty lot of help to me. - Anytime, Mr. Muller. - Can I give you a lift, maybe? - No, thanks. - Where can I get a cab? - End of the pier. - Good, good. Well, thank you. - You going off to the hotel? No. No. Fixing to visit an old friend of mine, Doc Lavimore. See you around, Gabe. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Dad. Dad. Dad. - Well, small world, ain't it? - Yes, practically microscopic. - What are you doing here? - Same thing you are, I reckon. Waiting for Doc Lavimore. Got an appointment with him? I don't need one. He happens to be my father. Oh. Operator, this is an emergency. Get me the police. Oh, now, wait just a minute here before you go off halfcocked. Maybe you ought to take a little look at this. Never mind. Thank you. Yeah, it got a little damp in the drink there. - A contract? For my father? - Yep. Head up the Research Department of the Emporia Institute. See that part there about the compensation? I left that blank. He can just fill it in himself. No haggling. But I don't understand. Who are you? Well, just a country boy who made good, if I do say so myself. They voted me chairman of the board of trustees. "Who's the best man for the job?" I asked. That's when your daddy's name came up. Well, uh, he's away. - Well, could you tell me where he is? - Well... Or maybe he wouldn't be interested in that kind of deal? Oh, no, no, I'm sure he'd be interested, but, uh, he's in Chicago. Oh, fine. Let's give him a little jingle. Maybe we can nail the deal down. Oh, that was, he was in Chicago but he left for Newport. Newport, all right? Operator, I'd like to... - But he's not there anymore. - Oh. Mr. Muller, I don't know where my father is and I'm very worried. Well, when did you see him last? Three weeks ago tomorrow. He said he was going night fishing. Night fishing? Oh, on the Outrider by any chance? Gabe Melcroft's boat? Gabe said that he never came aboard that night. And the next day I got a message from my father... saying that he had left on urgent business. Well, when does the Outrider pull out from the dock tonight? Eight o'clock? Why? Well, I think I might do a little night fishing. On old Gabe's boat. Hello, there, Gabe. Who's selling the tickets here? No one, Mr. Muller. This trip's booked solid. Oh, after me, you mean, no one gets aboard, huh? No. Sorry, Mr. Muller, I wish I could find room for you. But this group's had the boat reserved for a month. It's a club. Yeah, well, I understand how it is, Gabe. Tell you what. I'll bet you a nice 20-dollar bill here... that I can sneak aboard the Outrider without you even knowing it. Huh? Good evening, Gabe. Problem? I've been trying to explain to Mr. Muller. We're booked solid. I'm not getting across. I sure had my heart set on coming along tonight, I really did. Gabe, I'm surprised at you, turning down anyone who wants to go aboard... as this gentleman does. My name is Vincent Lockridge, sir. Harvey Muller. Vincent, I like your style. - Mr. Muller... - But Mr. Lockridge... Not another word, Gabe. I'll take full responsibility. Well, here's another comical story for you fellas here. This is about the flea, see, who came out of a movie theater. Ha, ha. Oh, this is a belly-buster, this one. These two fleas come out of this movie theater. And one flea says to the other one: "Shall we walk or shall we take a dog?" [BOTH LAUGHING] [FIREWORKS CRASHING NEARBY] SOLO: Fireworks. Now, that's right pretty there. Oh, that's just penny-ante stuff, Mr. Muller. They put on a real fireworks display on Saturday night. Oh, tomorrow? For a fact, huh? Whoa, Nelly. Whoa, we're not even out of the harbor yet, Harvey. You'll get used to it after we get out there. I think this is Harvey's first time out for albacore. That right, Harvey? I'm a sailor. I'm not a fisherman. They're gonna be striking hard and fast tomorrow. - We ought to give you few pointers. - Oh, well, I take kindly to that. Why don't you show Harvey how to bait a hook? - Sure thing, Mr. Lockridge. - It isn't easy. Those barbs are sharp. Now the thing, see, is to set the hook firmly in the anchovy, so it won't pull off. - That's not bad. - No. Once you get onto the hang of it. - Why don't you try it yourself? - Oh, well, sure, sure. - A slippery little devil. - Better hold on there. Yeah. All right. Get a little light on the subject. - No. Deeper. Deeper, Mr. Muller. - Ow! - Gabe, how could you be so clumsy? - Oh. Uh, Dr. Martin, would you take a look at this, please? Oh, you got a doctor on board. That's real style. We're always ready for any emergency. What do you think? - Why don't you let her bleed? - No, no. Dr. Martin has the thing for a cut like that. Don't you? I tell you, fellas, if it's all the same with you... Dr. Foster, why don't you hold Harvey's arm so it doesn't jiggle? Oh, yeah. Well, maybe you're right. Wouldn't wanna take a chance on an infection. Heh. Let her rip, doc. [GROANING] It ought to feel warm around that cut. Does it? - Warm? It's burning up here. - You don't feel faint, do you? I don't? Wanna bet? Goodbye, Harvey Muller. [FIREWORKS WHISTLING] [FIREWORKS CRASHING] Well, doctor, who is he? Ahh, I don't know. LOCKRIDGE: You never saw him before? Never. I swear it. Never. Never. Never. Never. Heh, heh. I say, let's get rid of him. Throw him overboard. [CHUCKLING] Why take a chance, Mr. Lockridge? He may be missed. They may come around snooping. Let him live, I say. - Throw him overboard. MARTIN: Let him live. FOSTER: Throw him overboard. MARTIN: Let him live. FOSTER: Throw him overboard. MARTIN: Let him live. FOSTER: Throw him overboard. MARTIN: Let him live. FOSTER: Throw him overboard. MARTIN: Let him live. - Mr. Muller? SOLO: Hmm? Time to get up, Mr. Muller. We're heading into port. Oh. You mean, I...? Hmm. Oh! Ooh. Well. Any of you fellas seen my head floating around here? That nice king-sized one. Confess it, Mr. Muller, you were fortified by the cup that cheers... before you came aboard, weren't you? What do you wanna say a thing like that for, Vince? From the way you were barking like a fox and leaping like a tuna... I'd say it was a merry trip while it lasted. Uh, fox. Tuna. Hmm. I better get some air. Why don't you rest here till we get into port, huh? No, no, man. I gotta get some air. [SOLO GROANING] Hey, where is everybody? I'm looking for that Dr., uh... Excuse me. Hey, I wanna thank that Dr. Martin. Have you seen him? Do we have a Dr. Martin aboard, Gabe? The one who doctored my hand, remember? And the other one, that round jolly fella that kept laughing all the time. - I don't see him either. - I'll say one thing for you, Mr. Muller. When you tie one on, you do a very workmanlike job. Now, wait just a darn minute here. I couldn't have imagined that. I did down a few. You have females here. There weren't any of those onboard last night either. Were there? Whoa. I tell you. Mrs. Muller's boy is one mixed-up cookie today. Yes, and when we have that midnight supper, no albacore. Yes, sir. I'll make a note of it. Anything else, Mr. Solo? Yeah, I want a heap of geodetic survey data on the Southport Harbor. Whether it's deep enough and unobstructed enough... for a submarine to tool around in it. A sub large enough to launch a Polaris-type missile, I take it. That's the general idea. Yeah. Also this little tidbit. Last night I... Oh, excuse me. A snoopy friend just dropped by. Felicia. Felicia. Whatever happened to that cute Farmer Brown that used to be around? - A mere detail. The important thing is... - Liar. You told me nothing but lies. - That I saw your father last night. - Liar. My father? Last night? Who are you, Mr. Muller? There's an organization known as U.N.C.L.E. Heard of it? Well, I belong to it. Now, rather than go into tiresome details, we're interested in locating your father. - Now, do you believe that? - Yes. No. Oh, I don't know what to believe. You said you saw my father. Where? How is he? He's fine. As to where he is, I don't know. Last night, I was aboard the Outrider. And I want you to know that it rates very high... on my list of unforgettable experiences. Anyway, we were out about a half an hour... and we made a switch. We dropped off some people and we picked up some people. And among the people that we picked up was your father. Aboard the Outrider? I don't believe it. I'm not saying he's there now. I'm just saying he was last night. As to where he is now... - Is there an island out past the harbor? - No, not that close. I don't underst... They wanted me taken care of before we'd been gone half an hour. There's nothing out there. Just the... SOLO: The oil tower. FELICIA: Oh, but that's ridiculous. The tower's only a platform and an oil shaft. Is it? Maybe that's what they want us to believe. Felicia, do you have a boat? My father used to use the Hansons' rowboat. Good. A rowboat is just what I need to get me there as quietly as possible. - Uh-uh. You've gotta take me with you. - No. Oh, but, Mr. Muller... Now, it's out of the question, do you hear? Nothing but a lot of pipe and junk. Mm-hm. Well, let's just look it over. LOCKRIDGE [OVER PA]: Hello, Miss Lavimore, Mr. Muller. Come in. Come in. Shh. Well, Felicia, let's not keep the gentleman waiting. Mr. Muller, I'm scared. Scared? Why, nothing more scary... than going down in the basement of Eaton's Department Store. I hope we're on the right elevator for hardware and garden supplies. And my ears. LOCKRIDGE [OVER PA]: Keep swallowing, Miss Lavimore. The pressure will be equalized by the time we reach bottom. I suggest you both take hold of the grab rail now. One moment, please. Your gun, Mr. Muller. - In here, please. - Gun? LOCKRIDGE: The one the scanner shows in your shoulder holster. Oh. Oh, that gun. I declare, Vince, you got eyes just like a store detective. Well, I sure do recognize that face. LOCKRIDGE: Yes, it's the same man you fished out of the water. He's having a heck of a time getting buried, ain't he? LOCKRIDGE: I'm afraid he never will be. It was Dr. Ross' personal destiny to be in a side corridor... when a hydro wall collapsed. Dr. Ross' remains will be incinerated and disposed of... MAN [OVER PA]: Zero minus 55 minutes. LOCKRIDGE: as soon as we can spare time from the more pressing duties at hand. But here's Dr. Foster. He's going to bring you here to me. Ha-ha-ha. Hello, there. Welcome to our Valhalla beneath the sea. Well, that's what we like, ain't it, honey? A happy man. [LAUGHING] This way, please. Now, laugh it up and keep on your toes. I'm gonna jump our fat friend as soon as I get a chance. Oh, ain't this where that the Ross fella caught it, doc? Here? Yes, so it is, Mr. Muller. A terrible thing to happen to the old boy. If it's not too painful reminiscing for you, what really happened to him? Well, we'll never really know. But if you ask me, Ross was doing routine maintenance on the hydro system. - Hydro system? - Crystallized hydro gas. Maintains a counter pressure against the ocean floor all around us. Ross must have turned up the valve of a hydro pipe by accident. Oh, well, naturally, of course. It's in the same class as TNT. Why, 30 seconds with the valve open... it probably built up enough pressure to shatter, blowing out the ocean wall. [LAUGHING] LOCKRIDGE [OVER PA]: Don't, Mr. Muller. You're under constant observation. Don't be a fool. And stay alert, Dr. Foster, please. Yes, sir. Come in, please. Mr. Lockridge, where's my...? Gabe. What are you doing here? All the responses check out to the five micro level, Mr. Lockridge. - Might check the forward auxiliary too. - By all means, Gabe. Gabe. Why are you carrying that gun? Whatever happened to that nice Gabe Melcroft... I was gonna spend the rest of my life with? Well, it's the same man. The light's just a little different down here. I'm glad you're down here. After tonight, you'll understand. MAN [OVER PA]: Zero minus 50 minutes. [SNIFFLES] Daddy. [FELICIA CRIES] No, no, Felicia. Don't cry. I'm fine. Fine. LOCKRIDGE: You see, my dear... your father is an honored and most helpful guest, that's all. Dr. Lavimore and his daughter... might like to conduct their little reunion in his quarters. But first, doctor, would you be kind enough to make a final check of the potting shed? Thank you. Now, Mr. Muller, how shall we improve this shining hour? - A little entertainment, perhaps? - Why, nothing I'd like better, Vince. Remarkable. You're far from being a stupid man. Your stupidity is much too authentic. And I don't believe your name's Harvey Muller. Now, how'd you like it if I went around telling everybody... you ain't really Vince Lockridge? [LOCKRIDGE CHUCKLING] This is what we laughingly refer to as the potting shed. Would you like to see the merchandise we gift-wrap here? Oh, sure would, sure would. I got an aunt, you know. Aunt Libby. Got a birthday coming up soon. Uh, what's all that the fuzzy stuff them females is packing round? LOCKRIDGE: That's mycetae virulens. A strain of fungus with uniquely destructive properties developed by Dr. Lavimore. Well, now, that ain't the kind of a gift anyone really needs. It's a gift I happen to feel the world needs very badly. A gift isn't really a gift until it's delivered, is it? This is the vehicle we use to make deliveries. SOLO: Well, I gotta hand it to you, Vince. You really get great TV reception down here. That Cape Kennedy, ain't it? That is situated approximately 60 yards from here. Operates on the same principle as the Polaris missiles. MAN [OVER PA]: Zero minus 45 minutes. Vince, ain't rocket firing kind of a government monopoly? I mean, wouldn't they kick up a fuss if they caught wise to what you're doing? At this moment, a barge is being anchored directly overhead. Soon a truly magnificent display of fireworks will be shown from that barge. And the culmination of that display... Do you know what the culmination will be? LOCKRIDGE: An extremely realistic duplication of a rocket being launched. MAN [OVER PA]: Zero minus 40 minutes. I'm sure your organization has briefed you on all these details, Mr. Muller. You keep talking about organizations, there, Vince. Now, do you mean the Grange or the 4-H? You remind me of Dr. Lavimore when we first brought him here. He kept protesting until we paid a little visit to our conversation room. Conver... What? I didn't quite catch that. It's a room equipped with very interesting apparatus, Mr. Muller. You might call it a mental centrifuge. A device for separating fact from fancy. Oh, that's where we're going now? Yes, Mr. Muller. That's where we're going. You see, if our rocket launching proves successful... finding out what your organization is becomes an academic matter. If not, the information... [ALARM WAILING] Why, I'm disappointed in you. I thought you'd given up that Prisoner of Zenda escape nonsense. How do you close the door, Vince? - How do you close the door? - Don't be an idiot. Don't pull that lever. The door closes for good. [LOCKRIDGE SIGHS] You colossally stupid fool. You're dead, do you know that? Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say that. I figure I've got the head man here. Might be able to do some pretty fancy horse trading. GABE [OVER PA]: Mr. Lockridge. Dr. Martin's waiting for you. Gabe. Dr. Martin will handle the launching alone. Mr. Muller is holding me hostage in the first-aid room. [OVER PA] You will put Plan A into effect at once. Dr. Martin will take full charge. Goodbye, Gabe. Good... Goodbye, Mr. Lockridge. LOCKRIDGE: Gabe, one thing more... how much oxygen do we have left? Uh... For the two of you, at a normal rate of respiration, about 18 minutes. Thank you. Good luck. So that's what Plan A is, huh? Complete abandonment by colleagues and buddies. You can't understand that, can you? The old moralities, based on the value of the individual's life, die hard. Well, my life is now worth as little as yours. When a man joins our organization, he agrees that when he makes a mistake... that endangers the project, he becomes expendable. The door only opens from the outside. I advise you to relax. MAN [OVER PA]: Zero minus 30 minutes. Thirty minutes left, huh? And according to slide-rule Charlie out there... that leaves us about 17 minutes to hang around here. Gee, you're not gonna get a chance to see that balloon go up, are you, Vince? MAN [OVER PA]: Zero minus 15 minutes. And so we precipitate a clash that destroys both countries. Because both countries are honeycombed with dry rot and decay. - Well, Vince, you're still there. - We emerge... like Neptune. - Got two minutes left. - In the floor of the sea. I thought you'd like to know. Ready to take over. Reorganize the world... on a logical, emotionless scientific basis. Bravo. Bravo. [BREATHING HEAVILY] What a pity you won't be around to see the big day. But I guess, uh, Dr. Martin, he'll be able to handle things. Yes, he will because I planned and built this organization well. Well, Gabe. There's a smart boy. Yes, he is. He was completely uneducated when I found him and I taught him. I trained him. I brought him to his full potential. [BREATHES HEAVILY] [CHUCKLES] You can't needle me into breaking. Why should I break? My life is fulfilled. In minutes, my plan will be in operation. But you won't be around to take the bows. That's unimportant. Ah? As far as you're concerned, it never will have happened. Because you'll be dead, Vince. - You'll be dead. - It doesn't matter. This whole elaborate plan of yours, you know what it is? It's your own personal way of being blotted out... of committing suicide. As you'll be dead, Vince. You'll be dead. [GASPING] Gabe. Gabe. MAN [OVER PA]: Zero minus 13 minutes. Seal off the firing area. Gabe. Please. Please. [OVER PA] Please. - Mr. Melcroft, seal off the firing area. MARTIN: Mr. Melcroft. Mr. Lockridge. Mr. Lockridge. Mr. Lockridge. Where's the rocket, Gabe? Mr. Lockridge. They're not gonna like this, Gabe. You know that? You broke a lot of club rules disregarding Plan A. Leaving your post, acting like a human being. What are they gonna do? You think I'm gonna let him die? Mr. Lockridge. MAN [OVER PA]: Zero minus 10 minutes. - Where are you going? - I gotta get him out. - They'll be looking for him. - No. We gotta get a doctor. Doctor? But Martin Foster. They'll kill him. Dr. Lavimore won't. He's funny that way. He's coming around. He'll be all right. MAN [OVER PA]: Zero minus five minutes. Turnabout is fair play, Gabe. You do something for us now. Help me stop that rocket from being launched. Why should I? What future is there for you and Vince if you don't? But it can't be done. At zero minus, all controls were locked into automatic. Must be a destruct button somewhere, even in a place as cocksure as this. Well, sure there is. But the corridor leading into it has been sealed off. Nothing can be done. What's the name of that gas that caused Ross' section to blow out? GABE: Hydro. Why? Suppose we turned up the hydro valve like Ross did. Only in the pipeline area leading to the rocket. It would blow the walls out and bring the ocean floor down. Gabe. Help me. - How do you feel, Mr. Lockridge? - A little shaky. But fit enough for what has to be done. Don't try anything ill-considered. MAN [OVER PA]: Zero minus three minutes. They'll be looking for us. We find someplace to hide. No, there's no need to run, Gabe. There are ways to reinstate ourselves with the Committee. Let me guess. A grandstand effort to impress the Committee... about the heroic struggle you and Gabe put up, right? And a bullet for each of us. I told you you weren't stupid. - Stand over there, please. - No, Mr. Lockridge. This is just one of the necessary sacrifices of war, Gabe. Sure, Gabe. Listen, easy come, easy go. What's the matter? Dr. Lavimore, he's just a quack. Felicia? She's last year's model. You get rid of her, right? You call for help and they helped you. - You almost died. - Stand aside. But you can't kill them. You owe them their lives. Don't you understand? - Get out of my way. - No, Mr. Lockridge. [GUNSHOT] MAN [OVER PA]: Zero minus one minute 30 seconds. He's dead. Mr. Lockridge? Gabe, show us that hydro valve. - Mr. Lockridge? - Gabe, we need your help. This isn't any time for feeling anything. Let's get out of here. Come on. There it is. [SOLO GRUNTING] [BOTH COUGHING] - Shall we? - This way. MAN [OVER PA]: Zero minus 60 seconds. Hydro. [ALL COUGHING AND SHOUTING] [FIREWORKS WHISTLING THEN CRASHING] [EXPLOSION] Golly, that's neat, isn't it? It looks like the whole ocean's on fire. Come on, Eadie, that's the oldest gag in the world. They do it all with some kind of chemical. Big deal. They're not gonna have any moon shot tonight. Probably never even planned to, the con artists. Come on, let's get heading back. SOLO: Hear that? No moon shot tonight. Well, I guess we'd better shove off too. [SOLO GROANING] Hey, just what's going on here? Well, I tell you, officer, about three quarters of an hour ago... Miss Lavimore and myself rowed out to the Texas tower. Look, would you mind if we just skip the explanations? I don't think you'd really ever believe it, okay?
