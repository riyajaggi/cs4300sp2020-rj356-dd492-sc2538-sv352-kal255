 NARRATOR: Previously on Pan Am... I bet you've got a few surprises under that cute blue hat. Is that smoke? That speech is government property. Not anymore. Marry me! I... I can't say yes now. Teddy? Look at you. (BOTH LAUGH) I'm not going to let myself get hurt again. This is real. Pan Am stewardess can travel all around the world without suspicion. And what if I refuse?

 We can make this your last mission... And your last flight. (GRUNTS) (COCKS GUN) (GUNSHOT) (SCREAMS) (PANTING) That was never supposed to happen. But now that it has, there are certain protocols we have to follow, do you understand? You'll need an alibi in case anyone saw you follow him here tonight. Kate, I need you to focus. (GLASS SHATTERS) Think. Did anyone see you follow him here tonight? I don't know.

 Scotland Yard will investigate, and MI6 will want answers. Kate... Look at me. Right now you have to run. (SIRENS WAIL IN DISTANCE) (KNOCK ON DOOR) (KNOCK) (DOOR UNLOCKS) Bridget? Kate. I'm back. Back from the dead. (GASPS) Where have you been? What are you doing here? Well, I was hoping you could tell me that. Well, according to my horoscope, I can expect a great opportunity to present itself. Let's hope that means Mike Ruskin is going to help me publish my article. I didn't even know you wanted to be a journalist. What I want is for the entire world to hate Congressman Christopher Rawlings and his nuclear death monger agenda. If I happen to become a world-famous journalist in the process, so be it. He didn't seem like a death monger. Looks can be deceiving. Stay there. My teacher said lighting is the key to revelatory photography. I'm forgetting why I volunteered for this. Because this week's assignment is portraits, and I told you that I needed somebody with a beautiful face. Ah. Now I remember. Oh, fudge. Light bulbs... Kitchen, second drawer. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Ooh! Your horoscope says that you'll meet a tall, handsome man. Hi. Was that Congressman Rawlings? No. (KNOCK) Don't! Maggie, you're acting crazy. He might be here to arrest me. Arrest you? For what? I... I might have set his hotel room on fire. London? That was you? CHRISTOPHER: Well, I can't actually arrest you. I'm not a law enforcement official. Plus I forgot my handcuffs. But something tells me you might have your own set. I heard you could strangle republicans with them, so I thought I should invest in a pair. Hmm. Nice hair. Why are you here? Specifically, you haven't been returning my calls, and I'd like to have lunch with you tomorrow. More generally, I think you might be insane, but you intrigue me. Lunch? With you? I'd rather chew off my own leg. Fair enough. Just one question, if you hate me so much, why do you care what you look like right now? (CHUCKLES) (WHISPERS) It's a good question. Call me. I'm staying at the Ritz. Oh, and, uh, nice to see you again, Maggie's blonde stewardess friend. Oh. You, too... Mr. Congressman... Sir. Sometimes opposites attract. More like out of sight, out of mind. TED: I think that you two would make a perfect couple. (LAUGHS) Me and Charles Talcott? Yes. You can't be serious. (LAUGHS) I'd have to fight that awful bulldog of his for attention. I don't know. He's very fancy. Oh, and fancy is perfect for me? What was the name of your horse again? Which one? (LAUGHS) Exactly. Okay. Maybe I grew up fancy. But that's not what I'm looking for. Then what? Snooty? Stuffy? Well, after four marvelous days in London and three in New York, I suspect all this time I was looking for you. Mmm. (LAUGHS) Teddy, it's getting late. Uh, I haven't seen the inside of your place yet, though. (LAUGHS) The inside of my place is being very diligently preserved for one very special man. That's me. I'm special. Not if you don't get some sleep. Big day tomorrow. Lunch with your father, the ever-imposing Mr. Vanderway. And the mood is killed. Good night, Teddy. Good night, Amanda. Hmm. What was his name? No, no, no, no. Bedford... Bed... Bedford? I doubt he's even that handsome offstage. But they wear makeup, you know? Redford. Robert Redford. Fine. See? Even the name... He just sounds like a prima donna. It might be worth it to wake up to that face. Aw. "Take me to go see Barefoot in the Park," she says. "It'll be romantic." Aw. I'm teasing you. It was a wonderful night. Yeah. And if I squint my eyes... Yes, you do look like him. (LAUGHS) And the French don't have a sense of humor, they say. Don't worry. I won't tell anybody. It'll be our little secret. Oh, I thought you didn't like secrets. Well, depends who's keeping it. Well, then, I might have one for you. Really? When we get to London. Really? What is it? Animal? Vegetable? Oh... Mineral? I can't tell you. Come on. No, it's a secret. Mmm. I have ways of making you talk. Oh, yes? Mmm-hmm. How? Oh, I admit it will be difficult to make it all the way to London without spilling this little secret of us. Who said that us has to be a secret? Apparently, it all came to a head in London. What did you hear? That there was a mission last week... To swap out a list of names, compromised agents, assets... And I was on it. But now, with that list off the market, I can come home. I can get my life back. That's wonderful, Bridget. Really. What is the first thing you're going to do? Get my job back at Pan Am, of course. (LAUGHS) And Dean. I've come back for Dean. I hear you have a houseguest. Yes. Thank you for the heads up. We thought you could be useful in helping Bridget with her...transition. The thing is, Richard, I'm tired of being useful, and I'm tired of being at your beck and call. I want out. You've made your wishes known. It's all been arranged. You'll be debriefed by MI6 when you get to London, polygraph, then you're on your way. Polygraph? I have to take a lie detector test? It's standard in cases like this. You were a witness to a shooting, after all. Witness. MI6 will want to make sure all the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed. We do have a dead body on our hands, Kate. (SIGHS) Yes, of course. No worries. Just tell the truth, and you'll be free and clear. And you and I can bid each other adieu. You done good, kid. (TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING) MAGGIE: Really, Mike? I pegged you as tidy. Is there a secret password? Uh, "abracadabra," maybe? "Open sesame"? Maggie, thanks for coming. I was so excited to get your call. I'm ready. Ready for what? Uh, my meeting with your editor. About my article? Uh... No. I actually called you down here to, uh, give you, uh... These. Uh, I don't understand. What are these? Political articles. And I should read them because? They're very well written. And my article was... Not so well written. (GASPS) Wow. Mike, I don't know what to say about that. Maggie, listen, you're passionate. That's a good thing. And you're smart. That's even better. And you spell really well, which is pretty much crucial to the whole process. So it's just the words you hated. You're the one who's doing the hating. That's the problem. Your article was an angry diatribe. Uh, so the folks who agree with you are going to get a kick out of it, but so what? They already agree with you. You have to find an angle. Why does he believe what he believes? Uh, where's he coming from? You have to lead the reader in and convince them that you're right with the facts. I thought I did that. You led the reader in and beat them with a baseball bat. Maggie, you're capable of it. You just gotta dig deeper. MAN: Ruskin? Oh, I've got to run to an editorial meeting. Do you, uh, you wanna do Chumley's next week? Oh, sure. Of course. The Ritz, please. Oh! Edward Vanderway. Lieutenant, US Navy. Serial number 653... Knock it off. I'm never going to figure out lighting. Sure you will. You're just not gonna get any good pictures with this old thing. (CLICK) But I'm a beginner, Ted. My sister gave it to me. If you don't want to be here... I'm just teasing. Jeez. So what's the assignment? Men of great character? Most eligible bachelors? I have to photograph one beautiful face... (CLICK) And one unusual one. What, seriously? Who...who's your other subject? Maggie. Oh, okay. (LAUGHS) For a second there, I thought I was the weirdo face. Yeah. Okay. I think I've got it. Good. (CLEARS THROAT) Hey, can I ask you, um, something? Did you and, uh, Craig, you know, uh, do it? That is none of your business, and for the last time, my fiance's name was Greg. Greg. Right. Right. Greg. Um, so I'm guessing everything's still in the lockbox? Stop talking. (SHUTTER CLICKS) Is there anything that Greg could... Craig... Greg...could have done, uh, different uh, to, uh, you know, make things unlocked? If you think for one moment that I'm going to coach you on how to get into some poor girl's pants... Don't smile. (SHUTTER CLICKS) She's not a poor girl. She's a very, very rich girl who I spent the entire week with. Nonstop. Except for when things do stop... abruptly, because of her strict pants-on policy. Amanda? From London? Yeah. Turns out she's better than advertised. But I saw her come out of your room. We were necking like a couple puppy dogs with peanut butter, but that is it. Hmm. What "huh"? Ted Vanderway finds a girl he's willing to wait for. I'm not willing to wait. That... That's my point. I mean, sure, Amanda is smart and funny and beautiful, but seriously, what is the point of boiling water if you're not gonna make the hot toddy? Well, I think falling in love may suit you. No, we're having lunch later today with my father, so I... I think after that, I'm gonna have to put the brakes on this one. Ted? Hmm? I want to respect you right now, but you don't make it easy. And you look like a statue. (SHUTTER CLICKS) I... I thought you'd respect me if I was honest. All I'm saying is there are some girls who are saving themselves for marriage, and I admire that. I'm just not one of them. Wait. What? (SHUTTER CLICKS) Ha. Did you see this? 2,000 screaming Beatles fans showed up at Heathrow last night. Yeah, apparently, "The Fab Four" were returning from Sweden... (WHISPERS) And word got out. Well, I hear they're very popular. You know... (CHUCKLES) They have girl hair. Right? (CHUCKLES) Well, it doesn't seem to bother their fans. (CHUCKLES) Um, can I cash this check, please? British pounds. Uh, you can go ahead and make that dollars. I need money for London. Pounds sterling. Thank you. For what? Five-star dinner in Balentine? Tickets to the ballet, then darts and drinks at the Squid and Wiggle? Yeah, we're doing all of that, and you're not paying for anything. No? Dean. What? You don't like the ballet? Dean. Hello, Dean. Colette... May we have a moment? Of course. I'll be on the plane. I've spent every night for months imagining our reunion and...and what I'd say to you when I saw you. Look... I can't, for the life of me, remember what I said. What did I say? When? Every night. Every night, when you imagined this moment, what did I say? That you were angry, betrayed, confused. The list was fairly extensive, and you have all the right to be all those things. I... I can't imagine what you're feeling right now. Why are you even here, Bridget? I've been reinstated back at Pan Am. They're flying me to London on the 2:00. You're a passenger? On my flight? I... I was hoping that when we touchdown, we could have dinner, and I could explain what happened and where I've been. All those nights... You imagining what I would say in this moment, and it never even occurred to you that I might just do exactly what you did... Leave. (WHISPERS) Oh. I'm so clumsy. Oh, let me help you. I got it. Colette, what's wrong? Bridget is back. (GRUNTS) I know. I saw her this morning. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) Hey, Kate. Could you give us a minute? Yes, of course. (CLEARS THROAT) You okay? I don't know. Are you? Yeah. Fine. We can talk about this later. There is nothing to talk about. Okay, nothing's changed. It is you and me, Colette. That's all that matters. You hear me? I hear you. Okay. Something you wanna tell me? (COCKPIT DOOR CLOSES) I was waiting for the right moment. I guess I waited too long. BOTH: Welcome to Pan Am. COLETTE: Welcome to Pan Am. Kate. Welcome. Colette. Welcome to Pan Am. I haven't had a chance to say a proper hello. Welcome. MAN: Thank you. Is this where all the congressmen hang out? Well, only if they love a good burger. Can I get some vinegar with those fries? Vinegar? It's a nasty habit I picked up from the Brits. They keep a bottle behind the counter here. You must come here a lot. Actually, I used to work here. That's how I put myself through law school. I have two older sisters. Dad was a longshoreman. I played trumpet in high school. And, um, I wet the bed till I was 11. (COUGHS) Why are you telling me all this? In the desperate hope that who I am as a person is more interesting to you than who I am as a politician. Oh. You're trying to distract me. I'm trying to tell you... I like you. (CHUCKLES) Scotch, please. Make it a quadruple. And then pour half of that into a second glass. Add two cubes of ice to each, and deliver them with water backs. You want me to get through lunch with my dad? I'm protecting you from yourself. It's what friends do. Friends? I don't need any more friends. But only one girlfriend... I hope? Amanda, um, look, we need to talk. MAN: Edward. Hey, Pop. Mr. Vanderway. Amanda. I just finished the back nine at winged foot with your dad. Since when are you desperate enough to spend time with my son? (ROARING) Ah. Thank you. Colette. Do you have a moment? Of course. It must be strange, me turning up like this. It is a little odd. We heard you were married. (WHISPERS) What? (NORMAL VOICE) No. Nothing could be further from the truth, Colette. Then what is the truth, Bridget? I was sick. Very, very sick. I didn't want to burden anyone, most of all, Dean. I'm so sorry. I never stopped loving him. I know he doesn't want to talk to me and I... I don't blame him. But you two are friends. Can you ask him to give me a chance? Just to explain myself. Please, Colette? Yes. (AMERICAN ACCENT) Excuse me, Miss, uh, I need another Tom Collins, please. (GLASSES CLINK) (ICE RATTLES) (NORMAL VOICE, LOWERED) Scotland Yard is none too happy about the jeweler's murder, nor are they convinced it was a simple robbery. You made it look like a break-in, you took jewels... Well, not enough, it would seem. But it was a mission. He was selling... It was a botched mission. The man in question may have been a traitor, but for various reasons, Scotland Yard can't know about that. (SIGHS) (CURTAIN RINGS SWOOSH) Richard thinks you pulled the trigger. (CLICKS TONGUE) Yes, of course he does. That's what I told him. Why? To avoid further speculation, MI6 would love to give Scotland Yard somebody's head on a platter, which is why I have sworn up and down that I was the shooter. You were merely an unfortunate witness. You lied to protect me. (SCOFFS) MI6 won't hand me over to Scotland Yard, but they might sacrifice you. Unfortunately, they don't entirely believe my story. Why not? That is irrelevant. The point is, you have to take that polygraph and you have to lie... For both of our sakes. How do I do that? Don't worry. I'll teach you how. Little known secret. When Edward was a little boy, he refused to finger paint. Really? (CHUCKLES) I didn't see the point. It's not like we couldn't afford the brushes. Alice used to sit next to his high chair with a wet towel because he wanted to be cleaned off every time he touched the food. (CHUCKLES) I'm sure this is all very fascinating for Amanda, but maybe we could talk about something else. The point is, Edward never liked to get his hands dirty. Still doesn't. I live in Manhattan. It's not like I got a back 40 to plow. Figure of speech, son. It means you don't apply yourself. Maybe if you did, you'd be Captain instead of just first officer. (UTENSIL CLATTERS) Hey, you know what? You know, speaking of little-known secrets, Mr. Vanderway, Daddy told me that your freshman year at Warwick, you were part of the theater club's annual light opera. I don't remember that. (CHUCKLES) No. No. I'm certain it was you. Teddy, I bet you didn't know your father was an actor. No, I didn't, Amanda. Daddy said you were desperate to join the club, but there weren't any male roles left, so you volunteered to play one of the female roles. You played a girl? (CHUCKLES) It was The Mikado, if I remember correctly. The female parts were traditionally played by the girls at Miss Fielding's School, but when your father approached the director and begged... Oh, it sounds like you really applied yourself, Pop. I was a damn good Yum-Yum, if I do say so myself. (LAUGHS) (SNIFFLES) WOMAN: * You'll never know how much I really love you * You'll never know how much I really care * Listen * Do you want to know a secret? * Do you promise not to tell? * Whoa, oh, oh * Closer Hi. I didn't hear you come in. * Let me whisper in your ear How long have you been here? Long enough to know that I'm in trouble. Oh. You're falling for the death monger. * Ooh, ooh, ooh We spent the day together. (SIGHS) It was... He was... Amazing. Would it really be the worst thing in the world, falling for the Congressman? I mean, for goodness sakes, he's not a criminal, Maggie. Oh, no. No, that would be me. Maggie the arsonist. (TELEPHONE RINGS) * Would you promise not to tell? * Oh, oh Hello? Hi, Mike. What good news? No. No, you can't... stay there. Don't move. I'll be right there. Maggie, what's the matter? Everything. * Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (DOOR CLOSES) * Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh * You worked up an appetite? I got those, uh, reservations at Balentine and then your mysterious secret. Dean, I was thinking, maybe you should hear what Bridget has to say. (CHUCKLES) I... Why... Why the hell would I do that? Well, because you... We can't move forward until you put this behind you. I... It is behind me. But now it's in front of you, Dean, again. Colette. This is a conversation you have to have. Better you do it now. (LIGHT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) So how sick were you? You couldn't even call? The prognosis wasn't good. I didn't want to saddle you with an ailing bride. Oh, so...so you were doing me a favor, disappearing, not telling me where you were? Now... You're better. It's good news. (WOMEN SCREAMING) Did you know that the screams of 10,000 Beatles fans makes more noise than a jet aircraft taking off? What all the fuss is, I don't know. Rumor is they're staying in the hotel, and that's all it is, a rumor. You give me Sinatra any day. Times are changing. Not for the better, if you ask me. Not for the better at all. (PAPERS RUSTLING) Well, congratulations on your clean bill of health. Your husband must be thrilled. I'm not married. That was a lie, an atrocious lie, Dean. What about the other men? Are they all an atrocious lie? There were never any other men. No. No. There were always other men... in bars, in elevators, in hotel lobbies. No, Dean... No, I saw that, Bridget. I saw the nods, the glances, the smiles. I just never let myself believe it. Dean, no. So you cheated on me, you lied, you left, and now I'm done. Dean, I never wanted to lie to you. ANDERSON: The trick to a successful lie is to believe that you're telling the truth. If you know that something is false, how can you trick yourself into believing it isn't? Simply make the false answer another question's truth. Look, if I ask you, "Did you shoot Mr. Bolger?" You simply fashion, in your mind, a question which the truthful answer is "No." Something like, uh... "Am I a secretary?" Then you simply speak the answer, no. This is ridiculous. It is one lie, Kate. It is one lie. You can tell the truth about everything else that happened that night. How you were pulled into the mission, how you ended up at the jeweler's, the race to get there. You need only lie about one thing, and you're free and clear of this forever. Okay, now... Relax. Let's try this again. Shall we? On Saturday last, were you engaged by your superior... Block it out, Kate. Shut it down. If you need to make peace with what you've done, now is not the time. I don't want to shut it down. I have been trying to forget... (VOICE BREAKING) pretending like it didn't happen, like it was a bad dream, but it doesn't matter. I killed a man, Anderson. (INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY) (LAMP CLATTERS) I've never seen Pop at a loss for words. Well, I grew up with boys in the family. I couldn't beat them up, so I learned to compensate. With charm, wit, and a razor-sharp sense of how to bring a grown man to his knees. Oh, and which grown man are we referring to now? (HORN HONKS) Good night. You're not begging to come upstairs? Let's just say some things are worth waiting for. What happened to "It's not so well written"? Well, we were short a column at deadline, so I goosed yours and sent it off to the presses. But I...there weren't enough facts. It's a... It's a baseball bat. You said it wasn't ready yet. It wasn't, but you can't run blank space in a newspaper. You have to stop this, Mike. Don't worry. I did some quick research and I rounded it out a bit. You know, we're not gonna win over the opposition, but at least every liberal reader in Manhattan is gonna know what a jackass Rawlings is. (GROANS) Congratulations, Mags. You're gonna be published. (KISSES) (PAPER WHOOSHES) (SIGHS) (LIGHT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) Looked like you could use the company. I'm guessing we both could. How did you handle it, Bridget? The lying? The deception? It was hard at first... But I got caught up in the rush of it, convinced myself it was for a good cause, and... For a while, that worked. Have you ever had to take a polygraph? A lie detector? No. (INHALES DEEPLY) Have you ever done something in this job that's haunted you? Yes, and it still does. What's wrong, Kate? I'm sorry. I should not have asked. I suppose this is what it's like being on the outside. Everything I thought I understood about this world is... It's been turned upside down. (WHISPERS) If I don't pass this polygraph, I lose everything. Whatever's happened, it's in the past. One thing I've learned about this nasty business is whatever it takes to save yourself, you do it. I know that this is none of my business. But you've been gone a long time. If Dean has started over, maybe you should, too. (KNOCK ON DOOR) So I guess we're not going to make that dinner reservation after all. Sorry. I needed to walk, you know, clear my head. You're confused, as you should be. I'm not confused. I know exactly what I want. You. You can't force this decision, Dean. There is no decision. Of course there is. (CHUCKLES) So you're the one that told me to talk to her, and now you're gonna hold that against me? No, I'm not holding anything against you. I've been trying to tell myself nothing has changed. Hey, look at me. What has really changed since yesterday? Huh? I mean, I'm still not half as handsome as... Is it Bedford? It's Redford. Not half as popular as the Beatles. You were in love with her, Dean. She broke your heart. Now she's back. I can't be in the middle of that. Colette... Please don't make this any harder. Just go. Once you were upstairs, did you see Mr. Anderson engaged in a fight with Mr. Cyrus Bolger? Yes. Did Mr. Anderson see you? I don't... I don't think so. No. Did Mr. Bolger see you? No. Very good, Miss Cameron. Now... Miss Cameron, did Mr. Anderson shoot Mr. Bolger? Answer the question, Miss Cameron. I thought you'd be gone. By "thought," I mean hoped. You were right earlier. I was lying. (SCOFFS) Gold star for me. But I never cheated on you. There were never any other men. I was not married. All I ever wanted was to be your wife, Dean. I love you. But I had to leave. Okay, so you give me one good reason why you would have to disappear without a call, without a trace, a note, anything. It was life or death. My life and the lives of others around me. I was in real danger. Why the hell would anyone want to hurt you, Bridget? Because I worked for British Intelligence. MI6. I was a spy, Dean. I was a spy. Dean, you've got to believe me. Those other men, they were contacts. They were not lovers. I don't want to hear this. Dean. They told me I had to disappear. I had no choice. I wanted to tell you everything, but I couldn't. It was for your own safety and mine. What do you want me to do with this information, Bridget? Say, "Gee, thanks for the explanation. Let's get married now"? The whole relationship has been a series of lies, and whether you... whether you lied for your country or for the hell of it, it makes no difference to me. I've moved on. Dean, one thing I never lied about was you. I've always loved you. I love you still. No, it's...it's too late for that now. Dean, look at me. Look at me and tell me you still don't have feelings for me. Tell me that you don't love me. If you can do that, I'll walk down that corridor and I'll disappear. (DOORKNOB RATTLES) (RHYTHMIC KNOCKING ON DOOR) Ted. Hey. What are you doing here? Hope you don't mind me dropping by. Actually, I was just leaving. Oh. Headed to your boyfriend's? Maggie is expecting company. Kate's in London, so I'm staying at her house. I don't have a boyfriend. I thought because you said, uh, you know, you lost your, uh, the lockbox. Good night, Ted. Wait. Forget that. I... I, uh, I have something for you. Ted. It's the real deal, all the bells and whistles and everything. Oh. It's beautiful. And expensive. Why? Because you talked a lot of sense into me. You bought me a professional camera because I talked a lot of sense? And because you're an excellent photographer. Probably. (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHS) You're a real talent, Laura, and it'd be a shame for the world not to see that. But that's not all? No. Um, I need to ask you a favor. I need your help. Shopping for an engagement ring. (CHUCKLES) I'm gonna ask Amanda to marry me. Oh. (LAUGHS) Yeah. Come on. I'll call you a cab. I'll tell you all about it. Okay. * Something happened * Last night I don't agree with any of your ideas. I'm never going to. Whoa. Is that why you summoned me down here? To tell me you disagree with me? I thought we covered that territory. * An angel flew right through the door No. I, uh, I have to talk to you. Haven't you done enough talking for one day? * Someone smilin' Chris, I need to tell you... Can it wait? Till the morning? Mmm. * You and I were meant to fall in love It can wait till morning. Good. * Something happened last night * Kate. Kate, you did well. I did what you told me. Did you ask yourself an internal question? Yes. "Will I ever forgive myself?" No. Good-bye, Anderson. You saved my life, Kate. You saved the lives of every agent on that list. And now you've passed the polygraph under conditions which would've made most good agents crumble. Despite your protestations, you're very good at this. You're free to go, as promised. Anderson, wait. Wait. MAN: * You'll never know how much I really love you * You'll never know how much I really care * Listen * Do you want to know a secret? * Do you promise not to tell? * Whoa, oh, oh * Closer * Let me whisper in your ear * Say the words I long to hear * I'm in love with you * Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh * Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh * Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh * OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
