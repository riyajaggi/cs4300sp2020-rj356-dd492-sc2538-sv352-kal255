 when you don't follow orders. What are you doing? ♪ Well, I was walking down the street just the other day ♪ ♪ I met a little cutie just a-coming my way ♪ I'm telling you, man, I had a plan ♪ Mind if I sit? Uh, no, not at all. The newsstand at my station was out. At least they had Popular Mechanics. That's good. What's happening in the world? The President is going to Berlin. Right, right. First visit since the Wall went up. Have you ever been?

 To Berlin? Oh, uh, sure. I've been a bunch of... I'm going again soon. There's this good little bookshop on Friedrichstrasse. They sell first editions of Nietzsche. The Will to Power. Der Wille zur Macht. Terrific read. And that's where I start? A map of Berlin with the exact location. Buy the book. Bring it home. That's it? Tell the clerk, "Ich bin hier um ein buch zu kaufen." [EXHALES DEEPLY] Ich bin ein... Ich bin hier... Ich bin hier um ein buch... Buch zu kaufen. Maybe work on that. Oh. Here's your stop. [ENGINES WHIRRING] MAN: [OVER PA] Attention, please. Pan Am Flight 32 is now ready for boarding at gate 11. Flight 32 is now ready for boarding... Berlin? Is it as beautiful as it is in the pictures? I can't wait to find out. WOMAN [OVER PA] Arriving passengers on flight 9 from Lisbon... How have you flown this whole time and not gone to Germany? It's a mystery. That's right. You were pulled into Japan last time. Yes. I'm overdue, but today is the day. Good morning, Colette. Good morning. Here you go, sir. Ready for Germany? That's the rumor. Are you preparing to toast the President? [CHUCKLES] With anything but whiskey. I'm laying off the stuff for a while. Are you? Oh, yeah, and cigarettes. I've been told that they lead to dancing. I'm surprised you remember. [CHUCKLES] I remember a lot of whiskey... And stepping on your foot. But you seem to be walking okay, so I guess, uh... It was a moment, Captain, a nice moment, but that was all. MAGGIE: You've never done a press charter? I've never done a charter, period. You just gotta keep the drinks flowing. [SIGHS] Keep their cigarettes lit, and you'll be fine. That's very helpful. Thank you, Captain. I do what I can. But he's right. Journalists can be seasoned travelers, and seasoned travelers can be particular. They need food they can eat with one hand, and they expect to be treated as though their work is the most important work in the world. TED: You girls gossiping about the pilots again? LAURA: Journalists. Oh, right. I blame them for our 24-hour layover. Oh, that's just enough time for Kennedy to speechify a little, give the Wall a good kick. Farm boy, I pegged you as a Nixon supporter. Eh, they're all the same. MAGGIE: How fashionably cynical of you. Oh, is he knocking the Wall over? No, he's going to kiss it. Kennedy loves the Wall. He loves communists. He loves their cigars. We have that in common. That's all you know about him, isn't it? [CHUCKLES] What do you know about him? Maggie was a precinct captain for his campaign. Oh, so you've met him? No, but I'm going to. You're gonna meet Kennedy? That's right.When? Tomorrow in Berlin. [LAUGHS] Good luck with that. Journalists. You think one of them might know the President? [SIGHS] WOMAN: Paper, sir? Can I get you anything else to drink, Mr. Manchester? No, but you can take this away. Too salty for my taste. A simple pastry will do. When you get a chance, I'd love your autograph. You are aware that I'm not a movie star or a baseball player? [CHUCKLES] I've met them. What they have to say would not fill a column inch in the newspaper of record. May I have my pastry now? Pastry on the way. [TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING] I thought you could use another pillow. I'm sorry. What? [CHUCKLES] Oh, you're all hunched over. Oh. Thanks. My pleasure. [CHUCKLES] I'm sorry. Do you happen to write for the Village Voice? I do. Mike Ruskin. I recognize your picture from the column. What's a Pan Am stewardess doing reading the voice of Bohemia? Oh, what should I be reading, the Ladies' Home Journal? Oh, the... [CHUCKLES] I'm Maggie. Pleasure to meet you, Maggie. So I take it you're covering Kennedy's speech? Yeah, the Voicethought it would be worth the dough to send me in person. Context, atmosphere, actual reporting. Well, most everything is better in person, don't you think? I do think. Uh, are you going? Dying to, if I could get a good seat. Oh. Right. Um, look, I wish I could sneak you into the press section, but, uh... Oh, no, no. How could you? But if you're looking for atmosphere, you should let me and my girlfriends show you around Berlin. Ich bin hier um ein buch zu kaufen. Ich bin hier um ein buch zu kaufen. Zu...zu...zu kauf... You've come to buy a book? [SIGHS] You speak German. Here's a tip. The more you sound like a barking dog, the more they'll understand you. Do you need a landing card? Ah. Yes. [OPENS AND CLOSES DRAWER] Pen? I understand the communists are hanging red banners on the Brandenburg gate. God forbid they allow us a peek at East Germany. That seems a little paranoid. Welcome to Germany. [ENGINES WHIRRING] Welcome to Germany.MAN: Thank you. Welcome to Germany. Thank you for flying Pan Am. Don't make any plans for tomorrow morning. We have a date on the Kurfurstendamm. What's that? I have no idea, but my new friend Mike wants to go. [CHUCKLES] It's like the Madison Avenue of Berlin. You want to come? Oh, I would love to, but I'm meeting a friend of my own. Oh, okay. Well, then do you want to meet up for the President's speech? Absolutely. It's a date. [PANTING] [GRUNTS] Thanks. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. You sure? No. I owe you an apology. I didn't mean to embarrass you. Well, what... What are they gonna do? Are they gonna kick us out of the country? We're leaving. It was a terrible mistake. What, the party or the singing? Coming to Berlin. At all. [LAUGHS] [CHUCKLES] It looks like somebody had a little too much fun in Berlin. Uh, veni, vidi, vici. Well, I came, and I saw. I definitely didn't conquer. And no one feels sorry for you. It wasn't pity I was looking for. No kidding. [DOOR CLOSES] [CHUCKLES] I'm just gonna go fly the plane now. Where is Maggie? Oh, she's not gonna make it. What do you mean, she's not gonna make it? Is she all right? Yes. No. No. She's sick. A stomach problem. I mean, a headache. But I saw her in the concourse 10 minutes ago. Right, well, she ate something bad, and it just... It hit her. Bratwurst, I think. I thought you said she had a headache. Okay, I don't understand. Where is Maggie right now? [PANTING] [CHUCKLES] [ENGINES ROARING] KENNEDY: [ON TAPE] In the world of freedom... [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] The proudest boast is, ich bin ein Berliner.  DEAN: [ON SPEAKER] Flight tonight will be just under seven hours. Still, I hope you enjoyed your time in Berlin, and I don't mind speaking for myself and our entire flight crew, when I say that this was quite a day for us. That will be one for the history books. [CLICKS SWITCH] What? You're voting for Kennedy in '64, aren't you? I'm going to kill Maggie. Time for us to start watering down drinks. And plan on how we are going to kill Maggie. Are you girls having a party back here? We're a stewardess short on a plane full of drunk journalists. Oh, Maggie stuck it to me, too. She stole my cigars. You know how I like to stock up on Cubans in Berlin. [SWITCH CLICKS, TAPE REWINDS] KENNEDY: [ON TAPE] Ich bin ein Berliner. See? Right there. He said, "I'm a Berliner." No, in German a Berlineris a jelly donut. [CHUCKLES] He did not say "I am a jelly donut." Check your German dictionary. [LOWERED VOICE] Hey, before you go, I just gotta ask. What? Did Maggie pull it off? [MARCHING BAND PLAYING] LAURA: It's like the 4th of July. On another planet. This is another planet. Deutschland uber alles. "The edge of a new frontier." Oh, you're quoting him now? Who?Kennedy. What... [CHUCKLES] You're in love with him, aren't you? Ask what you can do for your country. Uh, I know what I can't do. Get you seats in the press section. What if I slip you into first class on the way home? Can we do that? Extra roast beef, unlimited liquor. [SIGHS] Come on, Michael. What's it gonna take? Besides that. It's Mike, and you're not press. Who cares? Just say that I am. I'll help you with your article. [CHUCKLES] The new frontier? Hopes and dreams in the Village Voice? MAGGIE: Well, what do you need, the smart, countercultural, anti-establishment take? Smart would help. So, Kennedy will come to Berlin to make a speech, sure, but it's not like he's knocking down the Wall. Wait. Maggie, you don't really think that. No, but his readers might, and it's not like you can go wrong telling people exactly what they want to hear. Ah, so you're a politician now? I'm whatever I need to be. [SIGHS] The line about knocking it over, I could maybe use that. [MEN SPEAKING IN GERMAN] [BRAKES SQUEAL] Sind sie die amerikanerin? Pardon? Sind sie hier um das buch zu kaufen? Uh, ich bin hier um ein... No, I'm here to buy a book. Los, steig ein! What? No. Der Wille zur Macht, Nietzsche.  [IN GERMAN ACCENT] I have your book. Get in the car. [SIGHS] Schnell! Steig ins auto! [REVS ENGINE] [GASPS] [ENGINE ACCELERATING] [PANTING] I'm supposed to buy this book in the store. I know. I couldn't make the drop. What happened? Stasi, the secret police. They infiltrated my network. The Stasi are in West Berlin? They were just at our hostel. They know who I am. Then they know your car. Pull over. [BRAKES SQUEAL] Uh, wait. Wait, wait. What are you doing? Come back! Come on! [PANTING] Now what? Where do we go? You're asking me? You're CIA, right? No. No. Yes. I mean, I'm just... I was just supposed to buy this book and bring it back to New York. I'm a courier. So am I. I'm just a translator. I crossed the border with an East German journalist for this speech. This is my third assignment. This is my second. We have to keep moving. I can't go back. If they find me, they'll kill me. Okay, you get out of town, a bus, a train. And go where? Berlin is surrounded by East Germany. [SIREN WAILING] Uh, the embassy. We can get you to the US Embassy. There is no embassy! Oh, no, no, no. I mean, uh, the Mission. You go to the US Mission. You go there. You can defect. Your President is here. No East German will get past security.[TIRES SCREECH] [GASPS] That's them, the secret police. [MEN SPEAKING IN GERMAN] I don't know what to do. Why didn't you keep the taxi you came in? There are no taxis. I had to walk. There will be a bus here in, like, five minutes. How many people are going to this speech? Um, some random number between 100,000 and a million. [CHUCKLES] Is that your expert opinion? Crowd counts are meaningless. Tell you what. You pick the number. I'll print it. 100,002. I'm not very ambitious. Uh-huh. Oh, before I forget... Oh. Thank you. It's my pleasure, Maggie, really, but I didn't have a choice, did I? Of course you did, Michael. [CHUCKLES] What's that? That's the President's itinerary. Do you have one? Uh, Village Voice,remember? Hey. Hi there. Did you just pickpocket me? No.Yes. Artful dodger, meet George Manchester. Oh, we've already met. Maggie Ryan from your flight over. The stewardess. Maggie's a little obsessed with the President. Well, there's a party for him at the US Mission. Need a date? Hey, I just got you a press pass. It's invitation only. Maybe if I bring a couple girls, like getting into a nightclub in the city? That would work? There are certain things about Kennedy... That are not to be shared with the civilian population. Oh, come on. The other girls, would they be stewardesses? MAN: [ON PHONE] That's a bit above your pay grade now, isn't it? Her cover has been blown. She has no other options. She needs to defect. She wants to defect. 17 million East Germans want to defect. That's what the Wall is for. [LOWERED VOICE] But she works for our side. As a low-level courier. I am a low-level courier. We're not going to risk our entire East German operation for someone who can be replaced by a 15-year-old with a bicycle. [EXHALES DEEPLY] Is that what you think of me? Let it go, Miss Cameron. She could be killed. That's not your problem. [LINE DISCONNECTS] What did he say? He's working on something. Hey there. Hey, Captain. Have you been outside yet? It's a madhouse. That's a fancy envelope. Well, it's a fancy party. Gotta do the old grip and grin at the US Mission. You know, butter up some German government officials, so Pan Am can expand their Berlin hub. I'll never understand why rich folk love to make small talk with people they're never gonna meet again. [CHUCKLES] Sorry. I didn't mean to offend. No, no. You didn't. Your ancestors probably danced at Versailles. [CHUCKLES] No. Come on. What were they? Barons, counts, dukes? No. I don't know. Or just... So you're the... You're the great-great-great granddaughter of Louis the... No, no. I didn't have any family. None? [SIGHS] So how old were you when the Nazis occupied France? I was three. But I don't think about it most of the time. Everyone lost people. We were all the same. I wasn't a special case. Kate, are you there? We have to leave now, if we want to see the speech. [SIGHS] Laura, I'm sorry. Uh, you're gonna have to go without me. [TELEPHONE RINGS] What? Why? [PANTING] Would you... Yeah, just hold on a second. You should go. Hello.Isn't it time to leave? [SIGHS] Colette. You should go. [LOWERED VOICE] No, I'm staying with you. Is Laura with you? No. Go, or they'll know something's wrong. Kate? Uh... Yes. We're coming right down. Okay, um, you wait here, and I will be back as soon as I can. What kind of something? LAURA: Kate? Laura, I'm coming now. I'm sorry. What? What kind of something are they working on? Um, I don't know. He didn't say. Did they teach you to lie? 'Cause you're not very good at it. [SIGHS] [HORNS HONKING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Um, I think they went this way! We have to stay together, or we'll lose each other! Whoa. [HORN HONKS] This is nuts. Which way should we go? All I can see are shirts! Ted, do you think all the streets are this way? Ted, what are you doing? Scouting. You look like Gene Kelly! COLETTE: Good thing it's not raining! [CHUCKLES] Good thing he's not singing. Do you want the bad news or the bad news? Sind sie amerikaner? What? Amerikaner? Oh, yes. We're Americans. [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] Kennedy! Oh. Ted, Laura! Come on, let's go! Ted, get down from there! Oh. Ted, let's go! All right! [SPEAKING IN GERMAN] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] KENNEDY: [OVER PA] I am proud to come to this city as the guest of your distinguished mayor who has... Oh, he started. He started! [CROWD SHOUTING] Kate! Kate! Colette! I'll meet you up there! Kate! Kate! What is the great issue between the free world and the communist world. [SIREN WAILING] Let them come to Berlin. [CROWD CHEERING] [FOOTSTEPS MARCHING] [GUNFIRE] [MAN SHOUTING IN GERMAN] [WOMAN SCREAMING] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [MEN SHOUTING IN GERMAN] [FOOTSTEPS MARCHING] [ALL CLAMORING] Okay! [LAUGHS] Not gonna lose you now. KENNEDY: [ON TV] The proudest boast is "Ich bin ein Berliner." [CROWD CHEERING] [VOICE AMPLIFIED] Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect, but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us. [CROWD CHEERING] Those cities that have been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of West Berlin. [CROWD CHEERING] While the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of the communist system for all the world to see, we take no satisfaction in it, for it is an offense not only against history, but an offense against humanity. Separating families, dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters, and dividing a people who wish to be joined together. [CRYING] [GASPS] Kate! Where is everyone? I don't know! When are they getting back? I don't know! Will you stand still a second? What do you want? We're going to a party for Kennedy. Oh. Why? Because he's the President! I just want to shake his hand. It's at the US Embassy. The Mission.Kennedy loves stewardesses. I figure, if we go as a group, we have a pretty good chance of getting in. Uh, we fly out tonight. Uh, we should all go in our uniforms. What? No! I'm not wearing my work clothes to meet Jack Kennedy. You said that he likes stewardesses. No, this is my plan. You are not going to... Maggie, he likes stewardesses. Let's show him stewardesses. We're Pan Am. And who can turn down Pan Am? See if you can convince the others. Anke. I found someone who will smuggle me across the border. Does he have papers for you, uh, forged identification? I'll be hiding in his trunk. No. I can't stay here. That's a terrible plan. I have no choice. Yes, you do. I can get you out. How? ♪ There's been a change in the weather Perfect. ♪ And it's changing Wow. We really are alike. I don't know if this will work. There's only one way to find out. Let's take her for a test spin. ♪ Change in me  Kate. Smile. LAURA: Oh, hello. Is this the friend you were visiting? Uh, yes. This is Greta Mueller, out of the Berlin hub. Uh, Greta, this is my sister Laura and our friend Colette. A pleasure. Arriving or departing? Athens, later. Oh.Mmm. Oh, guess what? Maggie's bringing us to a party for Kennedy at the US Mission. Tell Colette that she has to come. You have to come. You loved his speech. I did? Well, I saw you crying while listening to it. No, I wanted to catch a nap before we fly out. A nap? This is history. The time we met the President in Berlin? He's not my president. [SIGHS] The truth is is we need you. The bigger the group, the better chance we have of getting in. You're all going? Yes. Oh, and Maggie wants us to wear our uniforms. Oh, uh, I think the dry cleaning ate mine. Oh, no. Do you have a spare jacket? How did the hotel lose your shoes, too? I just left them outside my door for a shine. So much for German efficiency. All right. They're checking guests at the door. Put on your best Pan Am, girls. Excuse us. Sorry. Entschuldigen sie. [LOWERED VOICE] Okay, as soon as you get in, we'll find you a case officer or a state department official. But remember, you're having fun, so smile. Sorry we kept you waiting. The crowds, worse than New York. We're here as representatives of Juan Trippe and the airline, Pan Am. Name? P-A-N-A-M. Stewardesses. How did you make it past the front gate? "Ich bin ein Berliner," right?  Excuse me. So did you grow up here in Berlin? Mmm. Have you been to this building before? Mmm-hmm. My uncle used to deliver bread here, before they divided Berlin. I came with him sometimes. What was it then? It's the headquarters for the German Luftwaffe, uh, air force. So, do you know if there's a side door or a back entrance or something? What did your parents do during the war? What do you mean? Are they okay? Did they survive? Yes. How? What did they do? [LOWERED VOICE] Colette. We don't like to talk about the war. But you delivered bread here, to the Luftwaffe. We had a family bakery, that's all. That delivered bread to the Nazis. Colette. MAGGIE: There's Dean. Dean! Over here! Hey, girls.[CHUCKLES] We're with him. [CHUCKLES] Dean! We came to meet you. [PIANO PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [LOWERED VOICE] I'm sorry about that. [EXHALES DEEPLY] [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] George Manchester. He knows everyone and hates communists. I can't do this part with you. But tell him that you're an East German asset who needs protection, and he can get you to the right people. [WHISPERS] I'm shaking. You have gotten this far. [SIGHS] Thank you. Go. Anke. Smile. [SPEAKING INAUDIBLY] [SPEAKS INAUDIBLY] [BOTH SPEAKING INAUDIBLY] Dean, have you seen the President? Uh, I only got a brief glimpse. Where is he?He's come and gone. Apparently he had a whole circuit lined up. What? I'm sure he would have loved to meet you, but he's got a lot going on. Well, when did he leave? Just now. Like, a minute ago. Which way did he go? Maggie, I'm not in charge here. Excuse me. Excuse me! [GRUNTS] You can't go out this way! Hold these! [SIREN WAILING] [SHRIEKS] [SOBS] [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] New friends or old friends? DEAN: Yeah. Colette, this is, uh, Otto... Rontegen. The German Aviation authority. And, uh, Peter Newberry, US State Department. Ah, the international Pan Am stewardess. That is me. [CHUCKLES] Guten tag. Guten abend. Didn't you say you were flying out tonight? Oh, it's a special occasion. A glass of champagne's not gonna hurt. Uh, no. Ah. It's a very special occasion. Noch einen, bitte. [SPEAKING GERMAN] You speak German very well. I was forced to learn when I was a child. But that is water under the bridge, now that the Germans and Americans are best friends. We do share a common enemy. Convenient, is it not? [CHUCKLES] That's politics, right? Politics? No, it's a miracle. One clever speech by your president, and the whole nation is instantly absolved. Excuse us, gentlemen. We, uh, need to prep for our flight. I'm sorry. [CHUCKLES] Did I spoil your party? I meant, congratulations. I'm sorry. Let me make it up to you.

You were. I just didn't agree. Well, it's not your place to disagree. You do what you're told. So you're saying to just follow orders? Yes. You're actually saying that here? This is how wars are won. Do you have any idea how many people have risked their lives, so that you could carry that book? I know that she did, and I know that she was going to be killed for trying to help us. How do you know she wasn't lying? She wasn't. Mmm. I just heard my president promise the two million people in this city that we wouldn't abandon them. You brought an East German spy to an American consulate in your uniform. I know what I did, and I take full responsibility for... Miss Cameron, you have no idea what you've done, nor what it takes to keep a cold war cold. [SIGHS] [ENGINE WHIRRING] LAURA: You should be proud. You got so close. MAGGIE: Close is nothing. Close is meaningless. You got into the press section. You got into the Mission. You can tell the boys that. I don't care what the pilots think. That's not why I... What is that? That is Air Force One. It's still here. He's still here! Oh! What are you doing? Cover for me. I'm not gonna make our flight. What? I'm gonna meet him right here, right now. Wait! What do I tell everyone? Make something up! Something German! [MOUTHS WORD] Wait! Have you seen Ted? Where's Ted? Why? He has something I need. You're not on this flight. [SIGHS] What are you doing here, miss? My name is Maggie Ryan. I worked on Kennedy's campaign. I logged more hours than any other volunteer, and as a reward, I was supposed to meet him, but I took a bathroom break when the Deputy Field Director came for two minutes, and suddenly Marcia Phillips was going instead of me even though she only did half the hours I did. I just... I just wanna thank him for making me realize that each of us can make a difference. [SIGHS] I just wanna shake his hand. Well, you've certainly got a lot of enthusiasm. Thank you. But you haven't been vetted. I'm a Pan Am stewardess. They vetted me! I got him cigars! Cubans! His favorite. What? Cubans, his favorite. [SIGHS] Tell me your name again. Maggie Ryan. Okay. Wait here. Cigars for the President. She wants to give them...

Is it okay if I meet you there? Sure. [DOOR CLOSES] When the Nazis took over, my parents made plans to flee. They dropped me off with a neighbor and promised they'd come back to get me. But they never did. Never could. And the people who brought us into the apartment were so warm... And magnanimous. Your president tried so hard to lift their shame. But they should feel shame. I came to Germany to forgive. [WHISPERS] But I still hate them. [SNIFFLES] [VOICE BREAKING] And I don't know how to stop.
