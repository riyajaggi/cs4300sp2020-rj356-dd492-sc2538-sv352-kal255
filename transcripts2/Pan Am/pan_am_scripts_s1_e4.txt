 KENNEDY: [AMPLIFIED VOICE] Freedom has many difficulties, but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in. [TIRES SCREECH] MAN: Thank you.[WOMAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] MAGGIE: Who's up for a debriefing? KATE: Ugh. We just got home. New York is a city of the world. COLETTE: Oh, no, not that skinny boy who can't carry a tune. Bob Dylan is an artist. I'll bet money he'll be famous. I'll go. No, we have a date with the laundromat, and we depart for Iceland in 36 hours. Thank you very much, Miss Ryan. I miss Bridget. She was never too tired to play. Has anyone heard from her?

 No, not a word. Strange. Good evening, ladies. Good night. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] TED: [SCOFFS] Will wonders never cease? She's still talking. DEAN: [CHUCKLES] She'll come to her senses. She already did. What do you know? It's the boy wonder and his first officer. Howard. Tucking him into bed, Ted? Right after I finish cutting your food, Captain. With your family connections, I would have thought you would have been the one to jump seniority. Have you read the paper? It's 1963. A new generation leads. Careful, son. The fierce itch of ambition can be hard to scratch. We'll suffer through it, Captain. [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Uhh! Oh! Laura! Let's go! We're late! LAURA: I can't find my mittens! Will I need long underwear? If you'd make a list, you wouldn't be scrambling! Just hurry up. We're late. I hope you're not lugging all that on a subway. Well, if you would like to hail us a cab... At your service. Richard. Do you have an extra pair I could borrow? You won't need mittens if I leave you behind! LAURA: Okay, okay!Did you get any of my messages? Did you forget the part about us only contacting you? Taxi! I know, but I wanted to explain what happened in Berlin. I'm well aware of what happened. I got stuck with the paperwork. But you can sleep at night. It was for a good cause, right? Kate, you disobeyed a direct order. I know. I overstepped. It won't happen again. I understand you saved a girl's life, but you need to understand that you are of no use to us if we can't rely on you. You can. [SIGHS] I have really gotta learn how to whistle. Ah. Here we go. [SNAPS] Thought I was losing my touch. So... Will I get another assignment? [BRAKES SQUEAL] [KNOCKS]One sec. I need you to keep your eyes open in Rangoon. The agency might need you to run an errand. But we're not flying to Burma. It's Reykjavik and then onto Scandinavia! LAURA: Found them! I'll be right down! Laura? I said I'm coming! Forget your mittens! Uh, grab a swimsuit! ♪ Blue skies smiling at me ♪ Nothing but blue skies ♪ Do I see  MAGGIE: Come on. Who did you bribe in scheduling? KATE: It was a lucky guess. That we'd be rerouted to the orient? That I might need a bikini. Anyone up for a swim? Maybe in a year or two. I may cool off in a few minutes. Careful. She placed third in the Connecticut Junior High freestyle state finals. Only by a reach. I have abnormally long arms. Oh, perfect. Reach over there and pass me that cocoa butter. It's right next to you. I'm situated. Allow me. [GASPS] My friend and I were hoping you could settle a bet for us. Yes, it's true. Guarantees deep, lingering color. Ohh. [ALL CHUCKLE] We heard a rumor that Pan Am stewardesses checked into the hotel last night. Well, we heard a rumor there was a naval wedding this morning. One of our RIOs. KATE: You're stationed here? Saigon. We're teaching the South Vietnamese how to fly. Ahem. Oh, sorry, friend. Are they with you? For the day. Lucky man. You used to be a Navy man once, Ted, weren't you? Everybody has to earn their wings somewhere. Ah.Former aviator? Current.He's our first officer. A co-pilot. Good for you. I earn five times more flight hours, uh, in Pan Am than I did in the Navy, and you can't beat my crew. MAN: It's tempting. I'll have to consider it when I retire. Well, that'll give you plenty of time to get up to speed. I could fly that boat blindfolded tomorrow. By the time you work on your I.F.R. booster instrument rating, you'll be wearing bifocals. Missed your calling, buddy. Should've been a comedian. Missed his calling all right. Why'd you leave the Navy? TED: Look, don't worry about it. Aren't you boys hot in those uniforms? Maybe they can't swim. MAN: We're in the Navy. Well, there you go, Laura. One of these gentlemen will race with you. Oh, I wasn't looking to race. Are you sure? 'Cause I'll give you half-a-lap head start. MAGGIE: Loser buys drinks? Take this to Jakarta. Come on, Laura! Come on now!Come on! You're beating him! Come on! You got it! [SCREAMING] I won? [CHEERING] LAURA: Oh! MAN: Was there ever any doubt? What's going on over there? Battle of the sexes. Oh. Best one win? Of course. Oh, I won! Apparently, the secret is being endowed with monkey arms. I'm so happy she could amuse you. I'm being ironic. Laura's a gem! Did you see? I saw. Where'd you get that camera? Did you get a picture? Oh, I missed it. I'm sorry. MAGGIE: Drinks all around! [WOMEN LAUGH] LAURA: You didn't even give me the full head start.[AIRPLANE ENGINES WHIRRING] MAN: You didn't need it. [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [INSTRUMENT PANEL BEEPING RAPIDLY] [WHOOSH] MAN: Mayday! Mayday! [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Aah! [BURBLES] Aah! [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] [GRUNTS] [COUGHS] Help! [GRUNTING] DEAN OVER PA: Ladies and gentlemen, we're just crossing over the equator. We'll be landing in Jakarta in just under an hour. Did I do something wrong? I mean... No, not at all. Well, they knew I could swim. We told them. You were swimming. He was trolling. Oh. Well, Maggie said that... Maggie likes to stir the pot. It's her hobby. Uh, you have the pilots'? I do. No, no, Sputnik was a good thing. So it was a good thing. The Russians beat us into space. We needed a kick in the pants. Some kick. They got the first man up there, too. We could have beaten them in two and a half months if we didn't wimp out and send up that monkey.[KNOCK ON DOOR] Coffee, gentlemen? Please. Wasn't it a chimp? Like I said, a monkey. Yeah, right, so... No, none for me, thanks. So you look before you leap, right? You're learning, Captain. Bridget. You leapt. She loped. Thank you, Sanjeev. Completely forgotten. [DOOR CLOSES] Say... Did Bridget, you know, help you? Jump the line. What line? The line to that Captain's chair. [SCOFFS] I just thought maybe Bridget had a connection before she went Houdini. British aristocracy or something. Ted, the world does not work that way for most people. Tell that to the 65 Pan Am first officers with more seniority than you. Oh, so you counted. Rough guess. Does that include you? Look, don't get me wrong. I think you're a fine pilot. I'm just not buying this whole new image thing, not with your ugly mug. Or... That chip on your shoulder doesn't leave any room for Captain's stripes. Yeah, maybe. But seriously, how'd you jump the line? Well, why didn't you? [DOOR CLANKS OPEN] [DOOR CLOSES] At ease, Lieutenant. We'll make this quick. In the matter of the 12 September crash of the Juno-V3 Interceptor, piloted by Lieutenant Edward Vanderway... Excuse me, sir. Is this a finding? I haven't completed my testimony. We have your statement. Is it deficient in some way? No, sir. Then in the absence of any clear mechanical failure, this inquiry finds... Sir, with respect, as I've told you, I'm a test pilot. My job is to push aircraft to the limit in search of possible mechanical failure, in this case, I found one. My I.A. was stuck at 90 degrees left. No evidence of an altimeter freeze. The V3 cockpit is scattered all over the Atlantic. I repeat, no evidence. My testimony as a pilot and officer in the United States Navy is evidence. And your bar tab the night before is evidence that the Navy got less than your best that morning. That was over 12 hours before I flew. [SCOFFS] That's well within regulations. The aircraft failed, sir. Lieutenant, your presence here today requires you to listen, not to argue. While the absence of clear mechanical failure suggests the primary cause of the Juno crash to be that of pilot error, this inquiry requires further investigation and deliberation and recommends Lieutenant Vanderway be placed upon administrative duty until the matter is resolved. Dismissed. He's a looker, ain't he? [CLICKS TEETH] Is there any chance you all have a television set around here? Yes, we do.[LAUGHS] All right. Jakarta, coming up in the world. But it is not working right now. Or not. What's wrong with it? I don't know, sir. I'm sorry. Well, where is it? Maybe I can fix it. You just go down the stairs, you turn right, and you keep going all the way back. Okay, okay. [MAGGIE AND LAURA GIGGLING] Oh, it's so foreign! How did you get here so fast? Oh, Mr. Rickshaw knew how to beat the traffic. You should have tried one. So that's where my scarf went. Oh, you had two. Just ask. I thought I lost it, and you should be wearing a white scarf in uniform. I know. I forgot it. [SINGSONGY] That's a demerit. LAURA: I made a list of the attractions we can see while we're here, and I think if we don't leave soon, then I'm... I think you're a bit jet-lagged. Why don't you just rest here for a few minutes? Well, Maggie said that Jakarta is excitingly unrefined. [SIGHS] I tell you what. I'll go pick up our per diem and get a few tourist tips, and then we'll head out. Okay. Promise not to see anything without me. I'll keep my eyes shut. [SIGHS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [BELL CLANKING] [BICYCLE BELL DINGING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE] [BIRDS AND INSECTS CHIRPING IN DISTANCE] [SCREAMING] [THUD] Laura? Make no sense. What this word? Uh, it's, um, "souvenir." Sou-ve-nir. "Richard. Want souvenir? What destination? Kate." Yeah. You wait?Sorry? You. Wait. Reply. Uh, yes, I will wait. Thank you. [CLICKING] Five pieces of page paper. Two rupiah each. [CLICKING CONTINUES] [BIRDS AND INSECTS CHIRPING] Here's what you need to know. Lizards, good. Leave 'em alone. They eat the mosquitoes, not you. If you say so. We are definitely not in Kansas anymore. I can't believe you touched it, you weren't scared at all. Snake! Aah! Snake in the bathroom! What do we do? [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] Okay. Okay.What? What? We get outta here. Get dressed, and I will meet you downstairs. Oh, uh... Maggie? Aah! [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Hi. Excuse me. Um, I have to get going. Can I just come back later? Tomorrow. No, no, no. I'll just come back later. We close five minutes.What? [RAISED VOICE] We close five minutes. No, no, no. I need that reply now. You have US dollars? Thank you. You won't find this place in the tourist book, huh? [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Bir, silakan. I can order beer in 15 languages. Really? Well, don't be too impressed. After that, my repertoire tops out at "where's the bathroom?" [CHUCKLES] Ah, the scent of youth and freedom. Intoxicating. Thank you. Yes, we are the American dream. But, alas, merely your fantasy.[CLINK] [CLINK] Dominoes? Block dominoes or gaple. Serious stuff. High stakes. A lot of fun. You know how to play? I know how to win. [CHUCKLES] Pull up a chair. Ready for rematch? Oh, yeah. How have you been? On a winning streak. Oh, yeah, till I got here. Okay. Okay, you go now. [GASPS] [SIGHS] Make no sense, "if you drop camera, it break." "Drop camera, Harta Karun Laut"? Oh. Excuse me! Excuse me. Uh, do you know where Harta Karun Laut is? Green door. [SIGHS] MAGGIE: This is the best chicken curry in Indonesia. MAN:  ♪ Squeeze me, squeeze me Tease me, tease me Thank you. ♪ Tease me, tease me [SQUAWKING] ♪ Ow! Ow!  [SQUAWKS] How much money do you have left? Not much. Don't worry. I'm flush. Which one of those varmints looks tougher to you? What, the chicken? Well, they're cocks. It's a big difference. Oh. [SQUAWKING] At least the loser tastes pretty good, don't you think? [MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Let's go dance. Let's dance. [CLICKS] Laura? [SIGHS] [PANTING] Oh, God. Oh, Laura. Ohh. [CLATTERS] Hello? [DINGS BELL] Excuse me. Yes? Uh, excuse me. Uh, did my sister leave a note for me? Room 212? Sister? [SIGHS] Yes, sister. Uh, my sister. Room 212. No. [SIGHS] [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV] Oh, dang. Almost had it. [STATIC CRACKLING] Ted. Ted, have you seen Laura? Uh, no. Can you hold this for a second? I can't believe she didn't leave a note. Where'd she go? If she needs a spanking, I'm your guy. I know. I know. Restricted airspace. MAN:  ♪ Let me feel all right ♪ Hey, we're gonna twist all night ♪ Hey, hey Ay-ay-hey, ay-ay-hey ♪ Whoa-ho, whoa-ho What's our motto? Go native! You got it, sister! ♪ 'Cause we twist all night ♪ 'Cause everything gonna be all right ♪ Whoo-hoo ♪ Ay-ay-hey ♪ Ay-ay-hey, ay-ay-hey  [INSECTS CHIRPING] [LOCK CLICKS] Kate? Look. I'm practically a native. Yes, Colette told me. She saw you and Maggie out and about. Oh, we had the best time. [CHUCKLES] Maggie knows everything about everything and then some, and look what she made me buy. Mom will flip. Laura, is there a camera in your bag? Yes. [SIGHS] Oh. I borrowed it. I hope you didn't mind.Great. Just... Just give it to me. We just left in such a hurry. I didn't...Just give it to me. I'm... I'm... I'm sorry. Hello? [SIGHS] [RAISED VOICE] Hello? Uh... [SPEAKS LOCAL LANGUAGE] Um, are you in there? Oh. [SIGHS] [PANTING] [DOG BARKING] [EXHALES DEEPLY] [SIGHS] [PANTING] I don't have any money. You're late. [DOOR CLOSES] Snake's gone. [MOUTH FULL] I got housekeeping to take it. [SNIFFLES] They didn't seem very apologetic. Said it wasn't poisonous, like we could know that. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] You just took off. You just took off without a care in the world... Well, there was a snake. I... Room in shambles. Oh. I should have left a note. Do you have any idea how worried I was? I mean, what... What were you thinking? Maggie just came in. It all happened... You know, Laura, you weren't thinking... [SIGHS] And you sure as hell didn't give me a second thought. We might as well just be back home, you know? You just skimming by, and me paying for all of your mistakes. What are you talking about? I don't want to worry about you, and I don't want to take care of you. Who's asking you to? I don't seem to have a choice. Kate... You're not even giving me a chance. To do what, Laura? To be me? In case you've forgotten, I got this job on my own merits. Then act like it. [SIGHS] You want to get out. You... You want to have a job. You want to see the world. That is great, but do you know what that makes you? A grown-up, so grow up. It's so easy for you. No one ever expected anything from you. Excuse me? You always got to do exactly what you wanted. Yeah, Laura, I did! I did. I did what I wanted. I did what I really wanted to, but now... Now I'm doing what you wanted and you still don't want me here! No, Laura, I just want you to stand on your own two feet! I am trying! You're wearing bunny slippers! You're wearing bunny slippers! Well, I like them! You don't have to! [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] MAN: ...as the elevator door closes and slowly starts up the, uh, the entry tower. Booster locked and ready to go. Then light that sucker. And once again, he wastes no time in... Did you close down the bar? Wouldn't be the first time. [CHUCKLES] ...carrying his portable cooler and walks into the van... Is that the, uh, latest in tropical evening wear? ...following him into the transfer van. Paradise not what you expected? Through the gates... I'll tell you if you tell me, and we'll both deny it in the morning, hmm? All right. You go first. [CLEARS THROAT] [SIGHS] I killed a man in Amarillo. You did? [LAUGHS] Rube. [CHUCKLES]Brat. I don't need anyone else telling me I don't know anything. Ah-ha. A clue. Cooper will be up 136... What are we watching? Mercury 9 live liftoff. Sending the first man into outer space for more than a day. ...more time than land. [CLATTERS] Oh, come on! Not again. [GROANS] Technology versus Ted. Round six! [STATIC CRACKLING] Anything? No. Ohh! I will not be bested by some tubes and wires from 1952! Oh, wait. Wait. Oh, we got something? Yes. Uh... No. Wait. A little... Yes. Yes, it... Well, it... It's sort of working. Story of my life! Mine, too. Okay, there! Oh! Oh. Oh, can you turn up the volume, please? Uh, you... Look, you sit. I'll hold this. Ohh, thank you. Ohh. Will it fly by us? Oh, maybe... [CHUCKLES] In about 45 minutes, but it's more like falling than flying. [CLEARS THROAT] ANNOUNCER: ...earlier than he was yesterday morning. Oh, we lost it. Oh. Hey, oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Freeze! Right there. [LAUGHS] I wish I had my camera. Don't say the word "camera." ANNOUNCER: Four, three, two, one. [CROWD CHEERING] Ignition. Liftoff.Liftoff. At zero four after the hour, liftoff. All systems appear to be operating properly. [ENGINES ROARING] This is Mercury Control. The trajectory looks A-okay at this time. [CHUCKLES] MAN: Roger. You look good here, Gordo. COOPER: Roger. Feels good, buddy. I bet it does. They offered me honorable discharge. [CLINK] It's the least the Navy could do. I'm opting to decline it. And the devil did grin, for his darling sin is pride. That aircraft had a bum gyro, Dad. Everything has limits. Even you. [SIGHS] Here's a thought. I'll make a call. No. No, you want to fly a few more years before you settle down. I'll put in a word with Juan Trippe at Pan Am. I am a Naval aviator. I do not need your help flying commercial. Former Naval aviator. Not yet. Dad, I... I, uh... I need you to get your engineers to take a harder look at the gyro on the V3. It's been taken care of. So there was something wrong with it? Tell the Navy. They can reopen my inquiry. My company's contracts with the Pentagon are up for renewal next year. Contracts? [SIGHS] Oh, Dad. Umm... This is my last shot at the Space Program, so... It's over, Son. Accept your honorable discharge honorably and get on with your life. Plenty of blue skies ahead, Teddy. [THUNDER CRASHES] [ENGINES ROARING] Ooh! Time? Two minutes, seven seconds. Ugh! I'm slowing down. Do you really walk off the plane without your girdle on? We are in the tropics. That's no place for the shackles of propriety. [CHUCKLES] You know she got grounded for that. Do you see a grooming supervisor anywhere? Oh, don't worry. Kate's not a tattletale. DEAN OVER PA: Ladies and gentlemen, there's some weather on the ground in Hong Kong Harbor. We're gonna experience a few bumps on our descent. Too bad. The view is usually spectacular. Well, she doesn't have a camera anyways. I plan on getting my own. Oh, good. Is this fight about a camera? No. Yes. Oh. Tug-of-war. Must be nice. [LATCH CLICKS] You're lucky, no? Flying together? [SIGHS] I suppose we are. It's hard to fly with your wings clipped. [SIGHS] What does she mean by that? Laura, what have you been telling her? Nothing, I... I didn't have to. You're the one who does all the telling. [BOTTLES CLINK] [CALL BUTTON DINGS]Yes? Got it. Maggie. Hmm? All I'm trying to do is help Laura get up to speed... I was joking.And you're not helping. Aren't I? [SIGHS] She is inexperienced at everything. She hasn't done a thing on her own. Well, maybe she should. [SIGHS] Pan Am is the ultimate new beginning. Let her begin. Better batten down the hatches. Hmm? Heavy crosswinds. [RADIO STATIC] MAN: Clipper Two, over heading Sierra-Lima-Beacon, descend to 2,000 and cleared to intercept localizer for approach. [THUNDER CRASHES] [ENGINES ROARING] Clipper Two, do you copy? [STATIC] [KNOBS CLICKING] Answer him, will ya? Roger that, Kai Tak approach. Have you ever done this before? What, land it in poor visibility? The Hong Kong approach. First time without training wheels. Yeah, so never with these crosswinds then. Piece of cake.TED: Mmm. [ENGINES ROARING] Captain, airspeed 2-0-0 knots. Damn, who designed this approach? Satan. [STATIC] MAN: Clipper Two, call checkerboard in sight. Roger. Call checkerboard. [INSTRUMENT PANEL BEEPING] Okay, I have checkerboard in sight. Flaps to 30. Checkerboard in sight. Flaps to 30. Altitude, uh, 1,000 feet. Where... Uh, uh, what was our last wind speed? 225 degrees at 20 knots. 20 knots. Abort. We need to abort. Let's circle around. The weather's not getting any better. Tell the tower we're landing. Are you nuts? Hey! Do it. Cleared for 1-3. Clipper 2-2. At this airspeed, with that crosswind, you're gonna land in the water. I don't plan on maintaining this airspeed. We're at our crosswind limit. [PANEL BUZZING] At! At, not over. Captain, do you want me to take over? No! I want you to shut the hell up! [CONSOLE RATTLES] [THUNDER CRASHES] [ENGINES ROARING] [INSTRUMENT PANEL BEEPING RAPIDLY] [TIRES SCREECH] [THUD] [GRUNTS] [CLICKING SWITCHES] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [WOMAN ANNOUNCING OVER PA] LAURA: [HIGH-PITCHED] Oh! Oh! [GIGGLES] Oh. [LAUGHS] Here we are. [CHUCKLES] [THUNDERCLAP] Good news, my circulation has returned, and I didn't soil myself. That was quite a landing, Captain. I'll be at the bar... Until tomorrow. Yeah. That was quite a landing. Glad you agree. There were 128 souls on this aircraft. Yeah, that I got safely to the ground. We could have gotten safely to Singapore. Well, we got safely to Hong Kong. We were one short and curly away from landing in that bay. The only time we were in any danger was when you were distracting me. [DOOR CLOSES] Look, you're my friend, Ted. I like you. We can joke around in the cockpit. We can hang out on the ground, but you make no mistake, I am in charge in the air, and what I say and what I do is the law. There's no discussion, no second-guessing. And a sky god is born. Hey, call it whatever you want. You either accept it, or you need to get another jet. A good captain respects and utilizes the expertise of his crew. And a good first officer knows exactly when and where to offer it. Where the hell are all the umbrellas? Do you think you're special? You think you're the only guy that can make that landing? I... I was a test pilot. I can land an anvil on a postage stamp in the middle of the ocean. That's not the point. No. The point is, you think you're in the wrong seat. Yeah, I am. Okay, well, you either need to let it go, or you need to call your daddy to get you one of your own. [GRUNTS] [THUNDER CRASHES] [ENGINES ROARING] [CLICKING SWITCHES] Two days. It's been two days. Are you actually gonna let us land in New York without telling us how you got that shiner? Yeah, did some jerk sucker punch you? Guess we're on a need-to-know basis. [RECEIVER CLICKS] 3,000 feet. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We are making our final descent into the New York area. I want to thank you for flying Pan Am. For those of you that have traveled with us from the Orient, [SIGHS] welcome home. [RECEIVER CLATTERS] [ENGINES ROARING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [TELEPHONE RINGS] So, are we going for cocktails? Well, Kate will say no. But what do you say? [LAUGHS] Night, boys. Ladies. WOMAN OVER PA: Pan Am Flight 36 from London Heathrow, pick up your baggage at Carousel Four. [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] WOMAN: Sorry, sir. I'll be right there. All right. [WOMAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] Ted. Right place at the right time. That's how I jumped the line. I was downtown, headquarters, and I got stuck in an elevator with Juan Trippe for 11 minutes. I figured... [SIGHS] I got nothing to lose, so I told him what I thought about his pilot seniority system. And I asked him, I said, "Do you want to be part of the past, "or do you want to be part of the future? "You know, World War II vets versus what's happening right now with you and me, "the jet age." Sometimes you just get lucky. No, we make our own luck, Captain. Sometimes you just gotta step up. Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Buy you a drink? Twist my arm? Please, no more violence. And about that, you work on your hook. What? Why? Well, a little Ivy League. Really? Yeah. MAN: There you are. Burger medium well. The Jakarta cablegram office was not a model of efficiency. It took hours to receive your reply. I got to the drop as soon as I could. It was across the street. You were six hours late. But I made it, right? You got the camera. Yes, Miss Cameron. You made it. [GLASS CLATTERS] [MUSIC PLAYING N RADIO] [SCOFFS] These, um... They didn't ruin anything, did they? Just your sister's reputation. [MUSIC CONTINUES] We're getting her out of your way. I beg your pardon? Your sister. Can't have her impinging on your ability to function covertly. I'll have her reassigned. You won't be flying together anymore. No. She's not in my way. She's perfectly capable. I can assure you that my sister is not and will not be a problem. [TAXI DEPARTS] [DOORBELL RINGS] Laura? Hi, dollface. [LAUGHS] Well, it ain't much, but it's home. Welcome aboard. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
