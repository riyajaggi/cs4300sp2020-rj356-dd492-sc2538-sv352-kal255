 Pan Am (2011–2012): Season 1, Episode 1 - Pilot - full transcript 
 Dean takes on his first assignment since his promotion, piloting the Clipper Majestic on its inaugural New York to London flight. Bridget is supposed to be his lead stewardess, until she's a no-show for the flight. Grounded purser Maggie is called in to fill in for her. On the same fateful flight, Kate adds another dimension to her work as she takes on her first assignment from U.S. intelligence. Her stress is compounded when she discovers that newly minted stewardess, Laura, her sister, is also working the same flight.

 "known as the Pan Am stewardess." Next. "All college-educated, girls can fly until they are married or turn 32." Hands. Excuse me. Can you help me? That's quite a picture. Thank you. Uh, I have a bit of a problem, Miss... Over a million copies sold, and your hat is askew. Oh, I didn't pose for it. I was only leaving the building. Are you wearing your girdle? Yes, ma'am. [SMACKS] Oh. [CHUCKLES] Uh, is that... [CHUCKLES] Is that necessary? A girdle doesn't stand up and announce itself. There's a rip in your stocking. Yes. I know. Can you help me? My flight leaves in less than an hour. How long have you been flying? Three weeks and two days. [IN FRENCH ACCENT] I have an extra pair. We're on the same crew. Follow me, beaute. Not too dark, Miss Valois. This isn't a cabaret. Yes, Miss Havemeyer. Next. She likes the girdle. [SMACKS] [CHUCKLES] So, congratulations. When did they pick you for it? Just last week. I was on the San Juan leg. No, no. Not the flight. The magazine. How did it happen? I'm not sure exactly. Um... [SPEAKS FRENCH] Ah, pas mal. Vous avez etudie a Paris? A L'Universite de Baltimore. COLETTE: Make way for the face of Pan Am. LAURA: No, don't. Don't say that. Nylon emergency. Don't say that. I'm not. Don't apologize. You're on the cover of Lifemagazine. [CHUCKLES] Yes, with a face like that, you'll find a husband in a couple of months. Oh, I'm... I'm not looking for a husband. I hope not. You're famous now. No, trust her. She's not. [CHUCKLES] Looking for a husband, that is. Kate, I... I tried to telephone last night. A man just took a picture. I... I didn't ask for it. Of course you didn't. [SNIFFLES] I need gum. Does anyone want anything? Oh, hi, Kate. Can you chew gum in uniform? MAN: Clipper 22 cabin crew. Oui? Have any of you ladies seen your purser, Bridget Pierce? MAN OVER PA: The departure gate for Pan Am flight 310 has been changed. The new departure gate is... [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] And the magazine? Oh, no. I'm just looking. Are you sure? We'll sell out in a couple hours. I'll take one. Here. [SIGHS] Take mine. Uh, a pack of Wilmingtons and the young lady's chewing gum. WOMAN: 68 cents. Keep the change. WOMAN: Thank you. Pretty girl. Very. [SIGHS] Are you ready for your first assignment? Now? Seat 3-D. We need to detain him at customs in Heathrow. Replace the British visa in his passport with this expired one. Without him knowing? I'll take that as rhetorical. You forgot your gum. Oh. [TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACKING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] ♪ If you love everybody? ♪ What more do you find in me? Sure. Let me get it. Oh. Does the Marxist dialectic account for a dual thesis? That's Hegel, not Marx. Hello. Maggie? This is Bill from Pan Am scheduling. Can you volunteer for a special flight last-minute? I think you're working off the wrong list. We're missing our lead stewardess  on our New York to London. Can you come and be our purser? Today? 8:30 departure. Margaret, this is Paul Gilbert. Pan Am is launching a new Clipper jet...[MOUTHING] ...and I cannot let it fly without a purser. Did you know I was grounded, Paul Gilbert? Uniform violation. Not if you can get here in 35 minutes. I wish I could. I'm in the city. Get your fanny to midtown. I'll have a helicopter waiting for you at headquarters, and, sweetheart, wear the girdle. [RECEIVER CLATTERS] Helicopter? An extraordinary gesture on my part to get your purser here on time. What, Bridget's not here yet? Not your problem. Clipper Majestic departs on schedule. Write her first chapter, Captain. [SIGHS] Yeah. MAN: This is the last boarding call for flight 2701... John? ...to Sao Paulo, Brazil. Hey, John! Hey, was that your... The one from Rome? Oui. Well, he's about to be the one from London, huh? [LAUGHS] Did you know he was on this flight? I love surprises. Just smile through it, dear. Listen, you can crash here, but lock the door when you leave. Maggie. You dropped your silly blue hat. [SIGHS] Look, I get to see the world, Sam. When was the last time you left the Village? I don't need to see the world to change it. Well, I do. Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! [BRAKES SQUEAL] I'm going to 200 Park Avenue, the Pan Am building. [SIGHS] Wow. It's beautiful. Brand-new. Never been flown. What do you think, ladies? Can we make this work? Are you our pilot?One of 'em. No, he's our co-pilot. Well, uh, First Officer. First Officer. [TIRES SCREECH] [PANTING] Are you okay, miss? MAGGIE: Eyes forward. [TIRES SCREECH] Fuel quantity checked. Flight controls free and correct. Are we ready, boys? [CHUCKLES] Hey. Are you nervous? 'Cause I could take that seat, if you're nervous. [CHUCKLES] Thanks, Ted, but Pan Am wants actual pilots in the left seat. Ha ha. [CHUCKLES] [ENGINE WHIRRING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] KATE: Welcome aboard, Mr. Sabel. Right this way. 3-D is the aisle. May I take your coat? [IN RUSSIAN ACCENT] I wear coat when it's cold. Your briefcase? Gin with bitters, please. [WHIRRING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Colette. Bonjour. [CHUCKLES] Welcome aboard, monsieur. May I take your coat? John, please slow down. Tommy slipped. Oh. Are you all right, buddy? Uh, Evelyn, coat? If you don't mind, I'd love to get our son settled in first. Certainly. Yeah. [RADIO STATIC] MAN: Clipper 22, Tower. Your special delivery just landed. Over. Roger that, Tower. [STATIC] That's our girl. [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA] KATE: The Captain will give you a report  on our flight plan just as soon as his duties permits. We're happy to have you with us this morning. Well, thanks, Kate. Hey. Maggie, you're our purser? Best they could manage on short notice. Can we roll out, gentlemen? I'm getting tired of waiting. Maggie? Dean? You're a captain now? Did you just fly in on a helicopter? Oh, well, I like to make an entrance. [CHUCKLES] Uh, where's... Where's Bridget? I don't know. They just called me to fill in. Yeah? Who's filling in the rest of her? [LAUGHS] He won't be doing any actual flying, will he? Well, welcome aboard, Maggie. Thanks. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] So... [SIGHS] Who else do we have? A new hire. She's in back. "Laura Cameron"? My sister. I can't seem to escape her. They put you two on the same flight? Mmm. Well, isn't that something? MAN: Clipper 22, Idlewild Tower. Cleared for takeoff, runway 3-1-left. [BUTTON CLICKS] Cleared for takeoff, 3-1-left. Clipper 2-2 on the roll. [CLICK] [ENGINE ROARING] So how new are you, Laura? Is it that obvious? [SIGHS] [CHUCKLES] Better buckle up. Adventure calls. Oh. [SIGHS] [CLICKS] [BOTH CHUCKLE] [ROARING] [SWITCH CLICKS] [TONES CHIME] [SIGHS] [CHUCKLES] Go ahead. [CHUCKLES] Say it. [CLEARING THROAT] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. This is your... Captain speaking. Today you get to share a bit of history with us here at Pan American. This is the maiden voyage of the newest Clipper jet in the Pan Am fleet. If you've never flown on a jet to Europe before, you're in for a real treat. Our flight will only take six and a half hours... [CLICKS] Oh, thank you. ...with no vibrations or outside noise in our air-conditioned cabin. We're traveling at a speed of 575 miles an hour. In addition, we'll benefit from a substantial tailwind, courtesy of the jet stream... Mmm. So our ground speed could reach over 650 miles per hour. Thirsty? [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] An American man would say something, no? Depends on the subject. The family in row five and six. He's married. Oh. Well, did you ask? Oh, no. I don't care. I was only surprised. Oh. Well, good. Okay. That's very French of you. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Should we spike his food or his drink? Both. ...relax, and enjoy your Clipper jet service to Europe. [STATIC] [RECEIVER CLATTERS] What? I don't think I can call you "captain." You gonna be able to call him "captain," Sanjeev? 35,000 feet, Captain. I don't think I can do it. Maybe I'll start in Spanish, work my way up to it. [SWITCHES CLICK] Boston Center, Clipper 2-2 with you. Flight level 3-5-0 heading 0-1-niner degrees. MAN: Roger, Clipper 22. [STATIC] Hey, Boston, uh, could you contact Pan Am operations, see if they could secure a location on a Bridget Pierce? Come again, Clipper 22. Check on our missing stewardess, will ya? [UNDOES SEAT BELT BUCKLE] Whoa. Bailing out already? Permission to christen the john, el capitan? No. Still sounds weird. Maybe in Italian. MAGGIE: Well, Bridget must have called somebody. COLETTE: She'll turn up. She always does. TED: Hey, Maggie. Heard you got grounded. Somebody caught you out of your girdle? MAGGIE: It won't be the last time. TED: Let me know if you need help with that uniform inspection, hmm? MAGGIE: Oh, thanks, but I think I'll leave that to more experienced hands. [LAUGHS][CHUCKLES] Ohh. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Excuse me. Mmm. Pardon me. Oh. Oh. Oh. Lunch menu? Oh, would you take our picture for us? Yes, thank you. Oh. I've never seen one like that. Yeah, it takes a special film. The photos develop right inside. It was a wedding present from my parents. Yeah. It's all set up. Just, uh, press the top there. Are you on your honeymoon? Oh, finally. [CHUCKLES] I knew in the seventh grade. It just took him 10 years to ask. Excuse me, miss. Is this you? Uh... No. WOMAN: We are so excited to be going to London. We were gonna go to Paris, but my friend Sue Ellen just went to Paris, and we didn't want to come home with all the same stories, so... [CLICKS] Ohh! Lovely. Absolutely lovely. [CAMERA WINDS] Greg is a very lucky man. Your father saw him eyeing this house on Asher near the elementary school. We should really try the other necklace again. Perhaps just a bit more rouge. Kate, does it fit? We considered basting the hem but... WOMAN: Don't concern yourself, sweetheart. If your sister cared how her dress looked, she would have flown in for the fitting. Oh, I'm sure you guessed perfectly, Mother. Well, I had to, didn't I? You're still not changed? I had to mend the veil. What? What did you do to it? I didn't do anything to it. It just tore a little bit. Kate, stop. Just stop. Get dressed. I'll tell Greg we need a few more minutes. [DOOR OPENS] Whew. [DOOR CLOSES] Are you all right? Yeah. [CHUCKLES] It's just nerves, I guess. I can't seem to stop shaking. Well, you look beautiful, so just enjoy it. Can I get you anything? Could you get me some water? Yeah. Of course. I'll be right back. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE] [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] [WATER SLOSHES] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [SIGHS] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Congratulations. KATE: I traveled for 36 hours straight, but I got here. And still you couldn't manage the time to change out of that costume. [SIGHS] I am proud of my uniform. Do you know what we get to do? You made it clear you don't care what I think of what you do. Go ahead. Gallivant around the world if you like, but don't use your sister's special day... Oh, this isn't Laura's special day. This is yours. Because Laura hasn't made a decision for herself her whole life.[SIGHS] [CRYING] Laura? Laura, what happened? Did you faint? [SNIFFLES] I can't... Has she eaten this morning? I can't... Shh. It's nerves. Just smile through it, dear. Mother. I can't...Shh. I'll get a sedative. I don't think that's... I can't go through it. Kate, not now. I don't want... I don't want to get... Do you want me to open the window? I don't want to do this. Okay, sweetheart, just breathe. I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. Just breathe. You're all right. [VOICE BREAKING] I don't want to do this. Okay, do what? Marry Greg? It's too... It's too late. No, no, no. No, it's not too late. I don't want to do... I don't want to do any of it, but everyone's already here. Then we'll leave. They can all have a party without us. But... Mother... Laura, listen to me. You need to decide right now, because this is your life. What do you want to do with it? [BREATHING HEAVILY] [KEEP A KNOCKIN'PLAYING] ♪ Keep a knockin', but you can't come in Does Daddy still keep his keys in the visor? Oh! I can't believe we're doing this.[LAUGHS] Laura. Oh! Oh, you look beautiful. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. I... I have to go. Laura! I have to go! ♪ Whoo, you said you love me ♪ And you can't come in [KEYS JANGLE] [PANTING] Where are we going? I have a week. I'll take you anywhere you want to go, anything you want to see. I want to see the world. I love that plan. Yeah, you can show it to me. I'll become a Pan Am stewardess. [TIRES SCREECH] Girls, what do you think you're doing? Go. Go, go, go! Where are you going? Get back in the house! We are lining up![TIRES SCREECH] [SCREAMS] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [SCREAMS] No! The prelude is starting! [TONES CHIME] DEAN: Ladies and gentlemen, for those of you on the left side  of the airplane, as promised, you can see the southern coast of Greenland. Colette. I'm sorry. Uh, I didn't know you would be on this flight. [CHUCKLES] What a coincidence. I didn't know you were married. I thought you understood. Understood what? I'm your mistress? No... [SIGHS] [CLINK] Colette. I just need a little time. I... I didn't plan for this. What was your plan, Mr. Stanton? Believe me, when we met, I didn't expect... Now, Daddy? It's a long flight, buddy. Um, he wants to see the cockpit. Well, we can do that right now, okay? Come on.

Lost tourist in need of direction. Good. [PATS SEAT] I need directions to Tivoli. Oh, I... I can't. I... I promised Kate I'd meet her for lunch. [SCOFFS] So, tell her you got rerouted. Well, can you wait? Not my specialty. I'll, uh, save room for dessert. Come and find me. See you soon. [STARTS ENGINE] [RUMBLING] [MAN AND WOMAN SINGING ITALIAN OPERA] Taxi!

Well, then somebody got something backwards. [CHUCKLES] You'd really have to see her. Oh, I don't need to. You found the place? Oh, yes. They had a table waiting for us. And your friend? Oh, um, this is... I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name. Richard. Richard Parks. Bridget Pierce. She came to my rescue. My translation book was failing me. A Yank? He's, uh, hopelessly lost, I'm afraid. [CHUCKLES] Sit down. I can't. I'm sorry. Oh. I just didn't want you to be waiting. They need a purser on the evening flight to Berlin. Ma rimani. Lui carino. Uh... Forse un pochino. Ci vediamo a New York. Okay. Ciao. Ciao,Bridget. I take it that wasn't your sister. Oh. No, no. We fly together. I'm a Pan Am stewardess. Oh, well, that's my favorite kind of stewardess. [CHUCKLES] So, what do you do for a living, Mr. Parks? I work for the US Government. Intelligence. [LAUGHS] Hard to believe? No trench coat? Mmm. I didn't say I was any good at it. You, on the other hand, fit the profile perfectly. Beautiful, well-educated, trilingual. And I have the perfect cover. Exactly. A Pan Am stewardess can travel all around the world without suspicion. Wait. How did you know I was trilingual? No, thank you. [MAN SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN] Can I get you anything else? Uh, yes. Some peace. Maggie. Sir, would you like some caviar? From where? MAGGIE: Flown in daily from the Caspian Sea. Perhaps later. Wait. Wait! That is my Lifemagazine. No, I believe yours is in your briefcase. Can I steal a cup? Help yourself. Hi. I'm Ted. The First Officer. That's right. [CHUCKLES] What's your name? Laura. Laura. Is this, uh, your first, uh, intercontinental? Oh, no. It is. Nope. Not this one. I'm just being hospitable. Consider her restricted airspace. I'm just helping you girls out, pouring myself some coffee. You know, for a co-pilot, you spend a lot of time out of the cockpit. [RUMBLES] Great. [SIGHS] If you need anything, Laura, you let me know. [RATTLES] [SIGHS] I almost called home last night. Did you finally tell Mom and Dad that you followed me into the uniform? I wrote a letter. [SIGHS] You better hope it gets there before Lifemagazine. Miss? Um, excuse me. Can you help me? Have you seen my glasses? I think I left them in my coat. [RUMBLES] [TONES CHIME] Yes, I'll take a look. DEAN: Ladies and gentlemen, we're hitting a patch of rough air, so for your safety, I'm gonna ask you to please return to your seat. [SIGHS] [PANTING] I've got it. I've got it. I'm sorry. I couldn't... I thought you trained for this. Kate, I just started. This is hard for me. Hard for you, Laura? Nothing is hard for you. You're perfect. Is that what you think? Just get out of my way. I do not need a lost puppy. [SIGHS] [RUMBLES] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [RUMBLES] [CHUCKLES] That's good, baby. Excuse me, miss? Yes? I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name. Colette. Colette. Thank you so much for taking Tommy up to the cockpit. Oh, it was our pleasure. He's a very sweet boy. Could you sit for a moment? Is that allowed, visiting with the passengers? Yes. I can't imagine what it's like to be on your feet for so long. You get accustomed to it. I wanted to ask you where you get your eyelashes. They look so natural. [CHUCKLES] No. No, they are natural. They're mine. Darn. I was hoping they were Parisian, and I could pick up a pair. You're blessed. I'm jealous. What are you drawing, Tommy? Oh, last month it was space rockets. This month it's airplanes. Lovely. You're an artist. [CHUCKLES] Miss, could I have another martini, please? [SCOFFS] John, don't drive her off. No, not at all. [WHISPERS] My pleasure. MAN: Clipper 22, Gander Oceanic. Gander Oceanic, Clipper 2-2. Go ahead. Pan Am operations asked us to relay a response. Your missing stewardess resigned from  the London office. They don't mean Bridget, do they? Do you copy, Clipper 22? [STATIC] Uh, roger, Gander Oceanic. Clipper 2-2. Thanks for passing that along. Over. MAGGIE: Bridget loves Pan Am. She wouldn't quit. Never trust a radio. They once lost track of me for three weeks in Brazil. [CHUCKLES] Unless...What? She'd have to quit if she got married. Uh, who? What, Bridget? Oh, Dean. The whole company knows about you two. I didn't know. Everybody but Sanjeev knows about you two. Did you get engaged? Ah! You son of a bitch! Congratulations. If you're engaged, why is she in London? Oh, who knows where that woman ever is? She barely made it on the plane in Cuba. She was in Cuba? We all were. Flew out the last DC-6 full of released Bay of Pigs prisoners for Uncle Sam. Plane with a mutiny? [LAUGHS] Ah, it wasn't a mutiny. [ALARM WAILING] [MEN SHOUTING IN SPANISH] Esta bien? Rapido, rapido. Is this the last of 'em? You're asking me? I thought Pan Am was just flying out some freed prisoners. You didn't say we'd have to leave the plane. Let's get off the ground before someone changes their mind. Por favor, sigan moviendose. Hey, get on! We're wheels up in 10! At least they don't have any luggage, huh? Where's the state department? I thought they were supposed to be organizing this. Organized the Bay of Pigs. I'd rather they just pay Castro his ransom. Come on! We did try to invade his country. His country? Whose country is it? Castro's never gonna be able to hold on to it. Come on! Vamonos,Maggie. Let's get outta here. Where's Bridget? [ENGINE SPUTTERING] [RUMBLING] Number four fuel boost pump off. [SWITCHES CLICK] Check. Pump off. All engines stabilized at 1,000 rpm. Let's get the hell outta here. Cabin secured? We don't have Bridget. Well, where is she? She's not on the plane. I didn't see her outside. Captain, you're gonna have to kill the engines. No, no, no. I have a mission and a plane full of people I'm responsible for. You can't leave without your crew. We finally have clearance now. We're leaving. Yeah, not without her, you're not. I'm not gonna get stuck in Cuba. Dean! I swear to God, I will take off without you! Hey! Move! Move! Maggie, tell these people we're taking off in one minute. We're getting outta here, and do not let him close this door! No pasa nada. No, no, no, no, no. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Go, go, go, go. What are you doing out here? Looking for you. We forgot one. We almost forgot you! You're always disappearing on me. I always come back. Then good. Promise. Marry me. What? You heard me! You're asking me now? Well, I just decided now! On a tarmac in Cuba with a plane full of exiles? Are you mad? Say yes now! It'll make a great story! Dean, I... I... I can't say yes now. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Then say yes later. [SHOUTS IN SPANISH] [CHEERING] MAN: Arriba! [MEN SHOUTING IN SPANISH] DEAN: Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning our descent into London Heathrow Airport, where the local time is approximately 8:05. My newlyweds want a bottle of champagne to take with them. Do we do that? Uh, sometimes, if they're nice. They're certainly nice to each other. Thanks. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Kate, I never wanted to be a burden to you. I will ask to get reassigned. Laura, I'm sorry. It's not that I don't want you here. But you ran away from home for a reason. I liked knowing you were there to come home to. WOMAN: I'll take that from you. Wait. Hold on. [AMPLIFIED] Ladies and gentlemen, in honor of this jet Clipper's inaugural flight, by a random selection, we'd like to offer the passenger in 3-D a bottle of champagne. Please, give him a round of applause. [APPLAUSE] Here you are, sir. Compliments of Pan Am. No, thank you. Oh. All right. Wait. Is this you? Yes. [SIGHS] I thought these were models, no? Well, I just graduated from stewardess school, and I was crossing the street to go call my sister. I hardly remember the photographer. I was just... Happy. I guess it made a good picture. [ROARING] COLETTE: Have a good evening. Welcome to London. Welcome. Thank you. Stay dry. Have a good evening. Thanks. Welcome to London. Thank you, ladies. Welcome to London. Welcome to London. Thank you again. Our pleasure. Thank you. Have a wonderful trip. You still love surprises? Only the good ones. Oh, so sorry. I forgot my purse. I'll get it for you. Thank you for flying with Pan Am. Here it is. Thank you. Yeah. Tommy's drawing. No, keep that. I want you to have it.

[CLANK] [IN BRITISH ACCENT] Eventful flight?[GASPS] You're late. [GASPS] You're...British. Keen powers of perception. Give it a moment. You'll catch up. I take it you weren't detained at customs. Roger Anderson, MI6. [GASPS] I'll be one of your London contacts. [EXHALES DEEPLY] The passport? One of many. You didn't think we'd throw you into the field without a test, now, did you? [THUNDER RUMBLES] You passed, by the way. Barely. You walked out with it, didn't you? No matter. We were testing mind-set. We were testing will. Your real assignments might, in fact, be easier. Almost all foreign diplomats and businessmen, persons posing as such, fly Pan Am. You'll be expected to keep your eyes and ears open and communicate back to us. Sometimes you'll function as a courier. Bridget? [JANGLE] But you must use discretion at all times. Make no mistake. We call it a cold war for a reason. I understand. I certainly hope that you do. Mr. Anderson, people have underestimated me my entire life, and they've been wrong. Yes, well, we'll see if you live up to your recommendation. Wait. It was Bridget, wasn't it? Bridget arranged that meeting with Richard in Rome. She had an eye for talent. "Had"? Am I her replacement? [SIGHS] We have great hopes for you, Kate. [SIGHS] [LAUGHS] I think I like debriefing. It's unofficial, but mandatory. Yep. Yep. Tomorrow another plane takes off to someplace new. Vanished, today's mistakes. Their only trace? A touch more wisdom. I think I understand you better in French. [ALL LAUGH] COLETTE: Is that the British edition? Oh, no. Well, I had to get my own copy. Another continent? I can't get away from it. COLETTE: Why would you want to? Hmm. I'm not that picture. I... I could never live up to that. Because it's not you. It is the promise of you. This is all of us. TED: Face it. If Bridget were predictable, you would eventually lose interest. I've hit on enough of these girls to know that they're not like normal women. They're... Blah. I don't know. They're...mutations. I think I know where you're going wrong there, ace. Well, I mean that as a compliment. You think the first man to crawl out of the primordial ooze knew he was different? No. He just had an impulse that there was more to life than primordial ooze. Is this you trying to make me feel better? [CHUCKLES] See... You see that table over there? That is natural selection at work, my friend. [CHUCKLES] They don't know that they're a new breed of woman. They just had an impulse to take flight. So don't try and ground 'em.
