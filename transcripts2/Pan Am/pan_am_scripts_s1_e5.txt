 The Pan Am crew rolls the dice in more ways than one in glamorous Monte Carlo: Kate and Maggie square off for the attentions of a handsome passenger, but things get more complicated when Kate learns the sexy stranger is involved in her next covert mission; and Dean gambles with his career when an attractive, wealthy woman on the flight tempts him -- and he later discovers who her flying companion is.

 NARRATOR:  Previously onPan Am... What do you think you're doing? I ran away from my own wedding. Bon voyage, Laura. Safe journey. Marry me. I can't say yes now. Bridget? Fit the profile perfectly. A Pan Am stewardess can travel all around the world without suspicion. You have no idea what you've done nor what it takes to keep a cold war cold.

 Do you think you're special? You think you're in the wrong seat. Yeah, I am. Well, you either need to let it go, or you need to call your daddy to get you one of your own. [HORNS HONKING] [SIREN WAILING] You don't understand. Maybe if you whine at me another 20 minutes... It was my engagement ring. How could you just sell it? Same way you pawned it. I needed the money. Who pays my bills? Rockefeller? Guy comes in, likes the ring. You left it over 60 days. I sell it. [SPUTTERING] But... But...

 Don't spit all that out again. I get sob stories in this shop. I get sob stories at home. But here, this sidewalk, mine. No sobbing. Greg deserves to have it back. He saved up all his money to buy me a ring. For him, that meant everything. Oh, yeah? But for you, not so much, huh? Ah, crap. Freakin' hot. I hate summer in New York. [GROANS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] WOMAN OVER PA: Flight 270 arriving from... WOMAN: Thank you, Miss Cameron. Next in line. Laura, hi. Hey, hi. How is the new arrangement, staying at Maggie's? Fine. And did you, uh, did you settle things last night? Kate, why must you interrogate me about this? Maggie offered. You were more than happy to have me gone. No, I meant last night with Greg. You know, the man whose engagement ring you're returning? Had to cancel. He couldn't make it to New York? I didn't say that. I came down with the sniffles, some congestion, and we had this early flight this morning. Really? What are you saying, Kate? You don't consider this early? Oh, cookies. Can I help? No. No help. I don't want any more of your help. Good morning, Ted. Yuck. So do you wanna at least talk about what happened last night? This is all your fault. Am I chewing gum? No, I'm not. Gumdrop, Laura. Drop. [ENGINES ROARING] [EUROPEAN ACCENT] I never miss it. This Grand Prix? Every year? My boyhood dream was to be a racer... The Monaco circuit. Now all I can do is watch. Season after season. Quite sad, huh? Oh, yes, Monte Carlo, the beach, the water, the sun, every single year. Mmm. I feel badly for you, Mr. Lonza. Niko, please. Feel badly for Niko. Roger, Gander. We have our oceanic clearance. Clipper 2-2. It's all about speed. The Grand Prix is a race. It's not a beauty pageant. Through the streets of Monaco? My dime's still on the Cooper-Climax. I like the Citroen. Now that's an automobile. Not a Formula One, Sanjeev. Cooper-Climax won it last year. Thank you, miss. And that's my point exactly. Do you boys always leave this door open? Sometimes we get lonely. That is one heck of a dashboard you've got there. It does the trick. [CHUCKLES] Can I help anyone in here? Do you have any jujubes? Airport gift shop was out. Jujubes. No. But if you return to your seat, I can get you some pate. Oh, too pasty for me. And those poor little geese. But chewy gumdrops, pure heaven. So you're going with the Cooper, yeah? I will if you will. Dean Lowrey, your Captain. Ginny Saddler, your interloper. [GIGGLES] You were mentioning a pub, Niko? Oh, yeah. Sure. Great spot. Excuse me. Oh. Yugoslavian, I think. Who?4C. Are you blind? No. Just slower on the draw. I'm curious about the mink coat lady. A mink coat? In July? She's not VIP. There's nothing here. Where is she sitting? With our Captain. And then the engines started up. Vroom, vroom, vroom, and go! [LAUGHS] Really? Like Rebel Without a Cause? Fred and his DeSoto, Lenny in his Buick, and me and my handkerchief. [LAUGHS] "Miss Drag Race," Appanoose County, Iowa, 1955. Ah, so you were listening. Captive audience. Oh, my favorite kind. Was there a cliff? This wasn't a chicken run. Oh, there was a thing with chickens, but it was only the one night, and no one meant to... Well, no sense revisiting that now. [CHUCKLES] Anyone for a cup of tea? BOTH: No. No, thank you. Love one, but I'm gonna head back to my seat. These boys need to fly a plane. Yes, boys, why don't you fly a plane? [DOOR CLOSES] [CHUCKLES] Jujubes? That's your first thought? Well... Pathetic. Yes, I stocked up, and yes, that's pathetic, but this woman... This vivacious, voluptuous woman... Barely out the door, and your mind goes to jujubes. Among other places. Well, hallelujah, because sad to say, she took a liking to you, Captain. Get out there. Pal, jump off the ledge. Sign that dance card and tiptoe yourself into a little corporeal distraction. And at great personal sacrifice, to myself... I offer you these. [RATTLES] He's not dead, I hope. Dead. Eight letters, starts with M. "Moribund." It's a good thing you came along. See, I thought you'd be up in First. Oh, I like it back here. Who's your traveling companion? Oh, not one of mine. Just cold and tired, so I tucked him in. Sweet gent. Oh, it's a lucky gent. It's my coat. I'm the lucky one. See, people think that I wear it because I'm rich, which I'm not, or because I'm snobby, which I could learn to be. Truth is, someone's always cold on an airplane, even in July. I have a surprise for you. I love surprises. [GASPS] [LAUGHS] Uh, private supplier. [LAUGHS] [CLOSES DOOR] Excuse me. How you feeling? Your sniffles and congestion? Oh, yes. Much better. False alarm. [CLATTER] Just enough to cancel with Greg? I didn't wanna make him sick. Maybe you didn't really want to end it? Oh, I did. I do. Well, I have. [DISHES CLATTER] I'm trying. You have to talk to him. [SIGHS] I'm trying. And give the ring back.I'm trying. [CURTAIN RINGS SWOOSH] LAURA: I don't remember this weather. In London? In July. Oh. I like it. But it's chilly. Couldn't we find a closer pub to debrief at? Yes, but this is the one that... Mr. Lonza's going to? [NEWSPAPER SNAPS LOUDLY] MAGGIE: There will be race car drivers. By all means, then, let's dash. [CHUCKLES] Laura, you're right. It is chilly. I'm gonna run back for my jacket. I'll meet you guys there? You want us to wait? No, go on. I'll be fine. A bench in the fog, Mr. Anderson? Fog? Really? I hadn't noticed. But then again, I'm British. It's lovely to see you again, Kate. That was quick thinking, about your jacket. Yep. I am worth every penny. Wait. I don't get any pennies. Shall we discuss your salary or lack thereof? No. I think not. There'll be a man on your next flight... Niko Lonza, UN attache, designation of no importance in this particular assignment. I've met him. He was on our flight from New York. Well, no matter. We're not interested in him. However, Monte Carlo Casino, VIP room. Mr. Lonza will be gambling with a friend of his. A friend who is currently seeing an Italian woman who goes by the name of Lena Bracca. She's a Soviet agent. We'll need her fingerprints. How do I do that? Well, I suspect that you'll need to arrange for Mr. Lonza to bring you with him to the casino so that you can meet this Lena Bracca. That may not be so easy. He's already interested in another stewardess. Well... Un-interest him. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] So I said, "You have 21. You don't need another card." But he blurts right out, "Hit me." That sounds like something my super would do. The man doesn't know a mailbox from a flower box. Disastrous for the chrysanthemums. [LAUGHS] The table has opened up. Shall we? Oh, I don't know. You won't accept my challenge? Well, if you can teach me. I've never actually played. I have. I'll take your challenge. And I'll win. Your friend sounds like she means it. Well, she can be competitive. Uh, 8-ball? 9-ball? Bank? It's your choice, Mr. Lonza. Please, call me Niko. [R&B; MUSIC PLAYING] [CLACK] That's a good shot. Nice.[CHUCKLES] Think you're gonna make that one? Absolutely.[BALLS CLACK] Clearly, I underestimated you. Clearly. Let's try darts. Oh, after a rematch. Really? I mean, is that okay with people waiting for the table? She's right. I hate to be a pool hog. You won't allow me to even the score? I'm sorry. There was a chance at that? [CHUCKLES] Rack 'em up. Lovely. [MAN AND WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Good evening, sir. You're almost right on time. You can't mean me. Pan Am has the best on-time schedule in the world. That's a heck of a dashboard. [LAUGHS] No driver? He's at lunch. Very generous of you. Mmm, I'm a giver. Got a, uh, crossword puzzle in there anywhere? [CHUCKLES] Five letters, starts with "W," rhymes with "song." Why don't you come in out of the fog, Captain? Is this how you reel all your men in? No. Some of them can open a door. [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] [MAKES WHOOSHING SOUND] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [MAKES WHOOSHING SOUND] [IRISH BROGUE] Ah, poor frogs. Can't get the language down, much less drive. Where's Niko? Where's your evil twin? Billiards. Busywork for the unemployed, if you ask me. Now darts... That's a proper pub game. There's a word from the bird. Crickets then? I'll spot you the 20. Hey. Didn't see you much during the flight. Not at all during the flight. Am I avoiding you, or are you avoiding me? Ted, this... really isn't the time. Thank you. [BILLS RUSTLING] Oh! Oh. Where are you headed? Besides into a wall if you don't lower that thing. What are you doing here on your day off? Just trying to stay out of trouble. Cashing my check. Where are you... Where are you headed? 133rd and 7th. Harlem.Business. [CHUCKLES] You're kidding, right? I can't have business in Harlem? Should you? I learned the subway system. I can find my way down there. It's not down. It's up, and I'd hate to see you lose all this. Oh. Okay. Up? Nighttime in Harlem, I'm sure you'll blend in beautifully. That's not a very nice attitude. [CHUCKLES] It's exactly what you're gonna need up there. Ted... It's personal. You mean a female thing? No. Well, then what the hell? I'll come along. I haven't been to Harlem in days. [SIGHS] Fine. But I really don't wanna talk about it. Understood? Understood. TED: We've flown Pan Am brass before, but never a Senior Vice President. Yeah, that's a very nice lapel pin there, Mr. Henson. Consolation prize for the Pan Am executives. We wanted wings. Just kidding. [BOTH CHUCKLE] I'm sorry she's so late. Not a good sign in a secretary. [CHUCKLES] She has many positive attributes, promptness not being one of them. What time do you have? Uh, sorry, I'm not wearing my watch. What, you don't have your Rolex on? I thought you slept in that thing. Well, I stopped wearing mine, too. Much easier to ask someone. Ah, she deigns to join us. Oh. Sorry. So sorry. Do we have enough room here? Yes, of course. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go warm things up. [SIGHS] [LAUGHS] Secretary, my ass. No, it's possible. Lot of businessmen travel with their secretaries. First class ticket? Mink coat? The shopping bags? No steno pads. She's not his secretary. She's his mistress. Yeah, I guess most secretaries don't drive around in Bentleys. Oh, my God. You cashed in on the jujubes. [CHUCKLES] You know, I would never encourage you to... With... It's the Vice President. I don't plan on telling him. Could be worse. You could have jujubed his wife. That is not worse. A wife is the block he grew up on. A mistress is where he's living now. Well... You want the left seat, Ted. This could be your chance. [CURTAIN RINGS SWOOSH] Oh, I've been to a casino before, just not one in Monte Carlo. Really? What's your game? I don't know. Something where I won't lose a lot of money. Oh, in that case, I have the perfect system. You'll never lose. Mmm. And you'll, uh, teach me this perfect system. It's very simple. Stay out of the casino. [CABIN RATTLES] Sorry, Kate. There's been a slight change of plans. Laura's moving up to First, so you'll be covering Economy today. Hmm. You've been called up to the big leagues. Odd that Maggie reassigned you. Oh, yes, it's very odd. [BOTH CHUCKLE] A woman scorned. Sends the other one to the kitchen. Laura, I know you'll do the right thing with Greg. [CABIN RATTLING]Whoa! [WHEELS CLACKING] Right then and there with the groom standing outside in a penguin suit? That lady looks like she's about to fall. Should we wake her up? Oh, God, no. Second rule of the subway. Never wake anybody up. What's the first rule? Take a cab. What a wuss. Who? Craig. You never let the bride bolt on you. You bolt on the bride. MAN OVER PA: 72nd Street. Greg. Anyway... Next stop, 145th Street. I moved in with Kate that same night. I didn't have any money... [BELL DINGS] So I pawned the engagement ring. Oh. That's a dagger through a fella's heart. Thank you, Ted. I already know I'm a horrible person. I could just kick myself. [BELL DINGS] Well, you had to eat, right? I'm sure at the time, a short-term pawn seemed like a pretty good idea. Well, that's what I thought until they sold it to a man in Harlem. I mean, they can just do that? It's in the How to Pawnmanual. See, now they didn't give me a... Oh. Anyway, Greg's coming to New York, and I want things definitively over. I need to give the ring back. He didn't hear "definitive" when you hurdled yourself off that altar? Yes, but when he came to Paris... He followed you to Paris? Pathetic. Craig is Bambi. It's Greg, and he's not pathetic. He's actually quite romantic. Well, see, that was his first mistake. I mean, look at history. Antony and Cleopatra, Samson and Delilah, Pepe Le Pew... All of them brought down by romance. Well, he was really very sweet. You know, he saved up, bought the ring, found the right moment. [TRAIN WHEELS CLACKING] Oh, God, I really am a horrible person. [CLEARS THROAT] Oh! [GROANS] Was your whole relationship this much fun? [SWITCH CLICKS] Can I help you, Mr. Henson? A blanket, please. She doesn't like to share. Thank you. ROGER: There'll be a man on your next flight... Niko Lonza, UN attache. Mr. Lonza will be gambling with a friend of his. A friend who is currently seeing an Italian woman who goes by the name of Lena Bracca. She's a Soviet agent. We'll need her fingerprints. Where am I going to find shoes? Does he know all the games? Well, I... He must. I mean, he gambles here ever year with a friend. [CLATTER] He won $2,000 at roulette last year. So you can only imagine. I was shocked when he asked me. Le casino Cote d'Azur... magnifique. [ENGINES ROARING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [SHIFTS GEARS] Want to go for a ride? I think I've already been taken for one. Well, maybe this one will be better. It's hard to see that happening. Unless, of course, uh... I drive. I'm in your hands, Captain. [CAR DOOR OPENS] KATE: Have Ted and Dean even checked in yet? LAURA: I think they're still drooling over those sports cars. Boys and their toys, a timeless love story. LAURA: Colette. There you are. Anyone for a guilty pleasure? KATE: How guilty? 700 francs. No pleasure in that. No kidding. I'm off to saner pastures. LAURA: I do like that hat in the corner. Oh, and that bag. The bag and the hat. The cat in the hat?Ted. Do you have time to talk? I have plans with Kate. Does she know that? Ted, it's fine. You don't need to apologize. Who's apologizing? You ought to be. You just said I didn't have to. Because I assumed you knew you should. For trying to protect you? Which is not at all what you did, is it? Y... [LAUGHS] I can't explain myself. I was drawn to the man. You never said a word to Niko before the pub in London. It was sudden. I didn't really speak to him on that first flight. Let's talk about flights. I've never been a big fan of breakfast. All those first class eggs made to order. All right. You cancel your date with Niko, and those eggs go away. For a month. A week. Three.Week and a half. Two and a half, and we're done. Done. Excellent. [SIGHS] Quick whiz, then a few more shots, and I'm off to get gorgeous. MAGGIE: Don't wear yourself out. I'm Irish. I'll pick you up at 8:00. That's your date? Smile. Niko's worth it. [SCOFFS] Too bad we don't have a camera. Oh, but we do. [BOTH CHUCKLE] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] I was a Girl Scout. Oh, yeah? Mmm-hmm. As in "be prepared"? Yep. Yes, I would say that you are prepared... For everything except say... Telling me about a man named Everett Henson or his profession, which is... Oh, yeah, airline executive. I had the impression you liked the element of surprise. You could've filled me in a bit more on your life beyond "Miss Drag Race." I suppose. On the other hand, "Hey, Ginny, you said you weren't rich. "Didn't mention a job, "yet you wear a mink coat, fly to London, Monte Carlo, shop at Harrods. "You inherit a ton of money?" [CHUCKLES] See, I always figure that when someone doesn't ask you anything about your life, anything about what's staring them right in the face, they don't really wanna know. That wouldn't be you, would it? [CHUCKLES] Oh. Masterpiece. It's museum quality. Don't show it to Everett. He doesn't like anyone touching the car. You mean like this? [GRUNTS] [GIGGLES] You know, I do accept payment. This, however, will not be enough. No? [CHUCKLES] Still here. KATE: You're not getting rid of me, Philippe. Miss Cameron, I reiterate... We cannot release information about our guests. And I cannot be ready to go to the casino if I don't know what time Mr. Lonza's car is arriving. Perhaps you should ask him. Philippe, it's a surprise. He doesn't know that I've flown in. I'm sure he doesn't. A tear? Hmm? Would that help? Because I can do that. Please, no, do not. Christophe? Christophe? [SPEAKS FRENCH] 8:00. What ever are you talking about? Ah, Philippe, merci, merci. Je suis... Oh, it's 7:15. Thank you so much. LAURA: Well, thanks a lot, Kate. You just left me here talking to myself like a lunatic right in this very spot, as a matter of fact. Laura, Laura, focus. Can you do that? I'm not 12. How much money do you have on you? [JAZZ PLAYING] As you can see, Mr. Bodine, I have your receipt of purchase. Call me Shoot Man. Uh... Sh-Shoot Man? Come on now. Don't shy away from it. Shoot Man. Shoot Man. [LAUGHS] There it is. Thank you. As I was saying, I'm prepared to offer you $50 more than you originally paid for the ring... Tasty Pudding. Track two, side B, Tasty Pudding. White boy blows so smooth, you got to dig it. You certainly do. I wish I'd seen him jam with Mulligan. I'm sorry. Mr. Bodine... Ah, Shoot Man. Shoot Man... Do you dig Tasty Pudding? I, uh, yes, I do. I... I dig the... Tasty Pudding. But what I would really, really like to discuss is the ring. The ring ain't for sale. Excuse me? Man buys a ring, he means business. [SIGHS] Well, there's business, and there's business. Couple extra C-notes. I don't have that much on me today, but I can... No way. Well, I guess it ain't that important. Ted, hush. Shoot Man is taking advantage of you. Some people might call it supply and demand, but if that's how he feel, then... Sorry, little lady. Deal's off. I can't leave empty-handed. [CHUCKLES] In all fairness, you... You did say that you liked the Tasty Pudding. MAN OVER PA:  Downtown 2 train approaching. What? Downtown number 2 train approaching. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Wait! Knock it off! What is your problem? You! You... Usurped me. I usurped you? I was this close to getting the ring back. You were this close to being played. It wasn't about the money! I was trying to make things right with Greg so he could move on, so I could move on. And you messed it all up. You are... A horrible person. I thought you were the horrible person. Fine. Sure. Run away. Where are you going? First rule of the subway, Ted. Taxi? Taxi! [CHUCKLES] Where have you been? Sightseeing. [LAUGHING] I don't want to know. Oh. Oh. Wrong door, huh? Hate that. Your fly's open. [LAUGHS] [ZIPS] [WHISPERS] Key. Key. Oh, no. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Hey! Hey, you! W... Mr. Henson. Captain Lowrey? You're out of uniform, Captain. What are you doing down here? Oh, just dropping off a car for a friend, and, I, uh, I noticed this beauty. You? Well, this beauty is mine. Oh, yeah? I'm sorry about yelling. I didn't know who was doing what over here. No, I don't blame you. Don't blame you. Wow. These doors... Solid, huh? Your hand, Captain. You're like me, huh? Keep your greasy fingers off my car. Annoying as hell, isn't it? [CAR DOOR SHUTS] [ENGINE STARTS] [ENGINE REVVING] Yeah, I'd love to... love to take it for a spin. Sure. We'll get on that. Tomorrow. [ENGINE REVVING] Ginny. Dean. Key. From the front desk. Key. From under the front seat. Allow me. How did you find it? Well, I told you. I pay attention. When did you find it? Before Everett could. You know, you were right. He doesn't like people touching his car. [CHUCKLES] You look ready for a night on the town. [CHUCKLES] You, too. All dressed up, and nowhere to go. My friends' car broke down in Nice. Well, and that's not Monte Carlo's fault. Hmm. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [SPEAKING CROATIAN] [ITALIAN ACCENT] I'm so sorry, caro. Cars, taxi, tourists, everywhere. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] NIKO: This must be Lena? LENA: Niko, at last. I have heard so much about you. And I've heard about you. This is Kate from New York. Oh, I love Manhattan, the shopping, almost as good as Roma. Lena, it's so nice to meet you. I'm sorry. There was traffic? All is fine, thank you. Remy, is there only champagne? Is there no Chardonnay? Non c'eMoscato? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] I think we're just gonna have some champagne. That's fine. Oh, uh, I think Lena has the right idea. I'd love wine, too. Chardonnay? Sauvignon Blanc? Oh, I'd prefer something red. Lena, I am so sorry. I can be such a klutz sometimes. Oh, no, no, don't do that. Hot water will set the stain. I have club soda. It's a gift from the gods. It's like an eraser. We use it all the time for our passengers. I'm a stewardess... For Pan Am. [BOTTLE CLATTERS] If I can't make those look brand-spanking new, I'll get you a new pair... From New York. Please, let me make up for it. Schifosa. Excuse me, bartender? Yes, sir. May I help you? I would like to have a glass of something red, I think. Perhaps the '57 Chateau Capet-Guillier. Oh, that's an excellent Bordeaux, sir. And also, instead of having a glass, I would like to have a bottle, if you will join me. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] I think I will save this bottle as a... What do you call it? A keepsake? Memento? Both. It was an accident. Accident, blessing, good fortune. You know what? I think Remy will thank us. Thank you. I could see it from the beginning. Not a good match. You just met her. Well, I have a good eye for people. Oof. No, he'll never make his 11. Mmm. Not impossible. Mmm, he can't thread. He can't kiss. Nothing worse than a bad kisser. What do you wanna bet that not a single one of those men have ever played against a girl? I would take that bet. [CLEARS THROAT] What'd you wish for? Do-over. Oh, power over time and space. Quite a penny. 10 francs. Well, In that case, uh... My engagement ring? You have another 10 francs? I'll go for world peace. You've had it this whole time? I tried to get your attention. This whole time? A guy's gotta pick the right moment to give a girl a ring. Wow. That might have been the worst thing I could have possibly said right now. [SIGHS] Maybe I am a horrible person. Just thoughtless sometimes. Getting into it was so easy... Flower arrangements, bridesmaids dresses. Getting out? That part I really messed up. [SIGHS] The suspense is over. You're not perfect. How did you talk Shoot Man into it? Oh. [SCOFFS] The thing with musicians is you gotta start off on the right foot, which, in this case, was, uh, "What time you got?" Oh, God. Your Rolex? [SIGHS] [ENGINES ROARING] KATE: Thank you for choosing Pan Am. Good night. Bye-bye. Good to be back in New York. Yeah. Did you lose something? I thought I had a tin of aspirin. Monte Carlo, always too much of a party. It's too much of something. High wire, perhaps. Always loved walking it myself. Although sometimes it's helpful to have a net. Now where's the fun in that? Captain, there you are. I thought we missed you. Ah, I got you this far. You'll have to do the rest on your own. If you ever need anything from the inside. Yeah. And... If you ever need anything from 35,000 feet... [CHUCKLES] Okay. Should probably keep one of these on hand, too. Yes. I definitely will. Thank you.Absolutely. Keep it running. I'll only be a few minutes. MAN: Yes, ma'am. [ENGINE RUMBLING] For me? Well, it's the least we can do. Apparently, we don't pay you. Can't tell that Mr. Anderson anything. Ah, the lovely Lena. She was blonde last I saw her. She mention anything about Gdansk? Poland? Site of this year's World Fencing Championship. Interesting cover for a spy convention. I'm pretty sure Lena's already been to fencing school. The fingerprints should prove helpful. We'll be able to zero in on the nine aliases she's used over the last two years. Nice work. An 8-year-old could have done it. Did you get an invitation to a casino? Good-looking guy. I take what you give me. [SCOFFS] Hey. You can get these right here on the street. You've gotta love New York. How was your, uh, insurance... Official? [CHUCKLES] Agent. We call them agents. I, uh... I couldn't get out of there fast enough. So where are we going? Oh, just down the street. I'm betting we can find a few men who've never played pool against a girl. I'll take that bet.
