 Pan Am (2011â€“2012): Season 1, Episode 11 - Diplomatic Relations - full transcript 
 Dean is tapped to fly the first-ever commercial flight to Moscow, but the day of departure, a blowhard veteran pilot, Broyles, takes the controls and makes Dean co-pilot. While in Russia, Kate tries to pull off an important mission, but when Laura and another Pan Am stewardess are mistaken for spies, Kate tries to expedite their release with the help of an unlikely ally. Back at home, Congressman Rawlings and his staff work to track down whoever anonymously wrote the negative new story about him, and Maggie agrees to be his date at a fund-raiser. Can she keep her temper dealing with so many conservative political supporters and retain her cover as the article's author? Ted's relationship with Amanda gets serious, but Maggie learns something about her that may hinder this whirlwind romance.

 Previously on "Pan Am". MI6 will want answers. I have to take a lie detector test? You have a dead body on their hands, Kate. You're not begging to come upstairs? Some things are worth waiting for. You're trying to distract me. I'm trying to tell you... I like you. - I have to talk to you. - Can it wait? Hello, Dean. It is you and me, Colette. That's all that matters.

 I've always loved you. I don't think I've ever seen a morning more beautiful. Penny for your thoughts? En route to Rome last June... During our layover, I saw you come out of the hotel with a man in a gray suit. So I'm guessing that he was... A handler from MI6. Part of my mission there. And Paris... You left me at dinner and told me you had the flu. I had to sneak away to make a drop. So everything... Everything I didn't understand

 was because you were a spy, and I was in the dark. Not everything. Women are conundrums, even when they aren't spies. How about the reason you called off our engagement? I didn't know how I was supposed to be your wife when I had to... What, when you had to lie to me? Keep my cover, Dean. But that's over. I'm free of MI6. We can be together. Who is "we," Bridget? The woman I thought I knew, who I loved... She was fiction. No. The woman who fell in love with you... she was real. And then... and then you're just... you're gone. You left, and I was forced to move on. To Colette? Well... You have to admit, last night was wonderful. And a mistake. It was my mistake. I never stopped loving you, Dean. And I want to be your wife. The question is, what do you want? Hello? Yeah, this is captain Lowrey. Uh... yeah. I-I can get on the next flight out of Heathrow. Of course. Let... let him know that I'll be there. Uh, bye, now. I gotta get to New York. You seen my cuff link? Is everything all right? Yeah, uh... Juan Trippe requested a meeting with me in New York. Tomorrow. - Juan Trippe? - Yeah. What does he want? I don't know. Wait, wait, wait, wait. So let me get this straight... The... the chairman of Pan Am just flew you back to New York for a private meeting? That's right. What'd he say? Apparently Khrushchev and Kennedy have opened a hotline. The cold war's thawing. Mr. Trippe wants Pan Am to be the first Western airline - to fly... - Wait. To the Soviet union? Yeah. He wants to open a new route, so he's sending a diplomatic mission. Morning. How are you? To the Soviet union? That's what he said. Well, how come you get to go and I don't? - That he didn't say. - Ugh! You know what this means, don't you? You're Trippe's ace, the new face of the jet age. Doubtful. Next thing you know, he'll name the airline after you. Highly doubtful. Well, if I don't get the U.S.S.R., I'm making the best of my time off. How much "yes" you think a karat will give me? How much "yes" from who? What do you mean, "who"? Amanda. Wait, this is the girl your parents set you up with? - Uh-huh. - A month ago? - Thought you hated her. - Ohh. When you know, you know. And you know? I do! Oh. Does she? That's what I aim to find out. Just gotta pick the right moment. I guess we're both on a mission. What, you don't like onions? Onions? In your eggs? Congressman? I'm sorry. I like them better than I like the "Village voice," I'll tell you that. You're still fixated? On this worthless piece of yellow journalism? Yes. Quite. "Despite insisting he's a republican to the core, "an anonymous source close to the congressman "claims Rawlings' public policy stances don't match his private beliefs." Eggs. Eat. It's the "Voice." What do you care what they think, anyway? I don't, but I also don't appreciate sources with inside knowledge conspiring with the enemy. Aren't you "conspiring with the enemy" when you're with me? I don't consider you the enemy. Oh. What am I, then? You're an important constituent with an interesting world view... And, uh... Something on her lip. On my lip? Yeah. Cute. Yes, you are. Which is why I think it's time to show you off. I'm having a cocktail party for some wealthy donors. Be my date. What am I supposed to do, just sit on your arm, all quiet and docile? You're supposed to be your smart, opinionated, wonderful self. Hey. Come on. Consider it your coming out party. It'll be fun. Oh, my God, Richard! You didn't answer my knock. That doesn't mean that you can let yourself in. I deserve that much privacy. Not anymore. You're in with us all the way now. You knew I'd be stopping by sooner or later. We're going to Russia. Of course you'd be stopping by. One of our double agents has gone silent. Code name... Anastasia. Girlfriend of a high-ranking KGB official. She lives not far from the hotel where you'll be staying. Six months ago, I was a courier. And now you want me to pull this woman out of Russia? Go to her building. If she's still in the game, there'll be a potted sunflower in her window. Confirm Anastasia is active and alive, and we'll do the rest. Oh. How very magnanimous. Be careful. You're going to Moscow... The beating heart of communism. You get made for a spy there, you don't ever come back. Enjoy the motherland. - Pan Am - Ep. 11 - Diplomatic relations Sync and corrected by dr.jackson for www.addic7ed.com Hello, stranger. Colette. Hey. I'm really sorry we didn't get to connect before I left London. Oh, that's all right. Gave me a chance to think. And... have you? I'm still afraid of what Bridget's return means for you and I. But for the first time in my life, I'm not going to let my fear get the better of me. I want to be with you... As terrifying as that is. - I just hope... - No, no, no. I-I do. I want to be with you, too. I'm so sorry. I need to... - Oh, brief the crew. - Right. Of course. But... but when we get to Russia, can we... Talk more? - Yeah. - Please. I'll see you soon. Yeah. Hi. Our every move will be watched, literally, by the Russians. So be careful about what you say, about what you do, about who you choose to talk to. That said, this is an historic flight. It's an opportunity to trail-blaze not only a new route for Pan Am, but ongoing relationship with the Soviets. Which is why we damn well better not foul this thing up, right? Sorry for the dramatic entrance, but why sneak in with the ground force when you can soar in on the Enola Gay and drop the bomb? All right. The plan... Wheels up at 1600. Then ten hours to Moscow, where our job will be to spend four days showing the Russian bear the majesty, the beauty, and the good graces of the American eagle. If all goes well, you can tell your grandkids that you were the crew that got Russia for Juan Trippe. Excuse me. Dean Lowrey, boy wonder, right? - That's me. - I'm George Broyles. Captain Broyles. Well, it's damn nice to meet and glad you'll be holding down my right seat. I'm sorry... your right seat? Or left seat. I'll flip you for it. As for the rest of you, we'll have plenty of time to chew the fat over the vast Atlantic, all right? Two hours to takeoff, my friends. Who is that? Oh, that's a sky God. What exactly is a sky God? World War II pilots. Big heroes. Broyles flew a dozen bomber runs over Berlin. Mr. Trippe gives him and his kind carte blanche to use the airline whenever they like, however they like. Fuel at 43 degrees West will be 138,000 pounds. You guys always insist on having Russians aboard these flights into Moscow? Safety measure. For Americans. So we don't crash into the Kremlin. Ivan's not so bad. That's nice to know. Your sister Laura seems nice. We're all happy to have you back and safe, Bridget. We have hardly any assets... In the Soviet Union, no eyes on the ground to know what Khrushchev is up to. This is a huge opportunity. Are you working? Bridget, you know I can't. Talk about it. I know. Oh, it's just so odd... Being on the outside again. The silence is deafening. I take it Juan didn't tell you I was coming along for the ride. No. Juan didn't. That's his style. Wants to keep us all on our tips, you know? Look, it's a compliment, Lowrey, him choosing you and me. Juan knows if he wants to invade Russia, he's got to send in the big guns. Well, just do me the favor of not shooting me in the back, will ya? Do you think we'll get to see Red Square or Lenin's tomb? This must be hard for you, stuck on a 10-hour flight with Dean's ex-fiancee. You've heard? Oh, rumors... And I saw you two talking in operations. You know, it seemed intimate. Is it true? I won't say it's not. Have you talked to her... Bridget? No, not yet. Uh, we were friends. We were close friends. You didn't do anything wrong. Let me help. Thank you. I haven't quite got my rhythm back. Speaking of rhythm, I hope yours and mine won't be too badly affected by... You and Dean? I thought... Well, we all thought you had gotten married. If I had known that wasn't the truth, I would have never... I know. Dean told me all about you two. When you had drinks in London? Yes. Yes. Drinks. Dean and I... we spent a long time talking, and don't worry, Colette. I shall respect whatever Dean decides to do. I've been calling. And I've been hanging up. Don't be a child. You're the one who took what I wrote and twisted it for your stupid "Voice" article. How exactly did I twist it? Yes, I have issues with some of Chris's beliefs, but to say that he's a hypocrite... "Chris"? Well, you two are cozy. That he doesn't actually hold these beliefs is not what I meant. Which means he's more of a warmonger than I made him out to be? Take a hike, Mike. I don't understand what's going on here, Mags. You know, one minute you want to destroy the man, and the next you're on a first-name basis with the biggest death merchant in congress. Wh... You're sleeping with him, aren't you? Well, I'm not sleeping with you anymore, Mike, so other than that, it's none of your damn business. Unbelievable. You... Well, I-I just came by to warn you that the congressman's staff is obsessed with uncovering the source for my article. Are you threatening to tell them it's me? I just came by to give you a heads-up that they're not stopping until they figure out who the rat is. Other than that, enjoy your life, future Mrs. Congressman. Pan American World Airways, we welcome you to Moscow. I am Olga Dubovik, representative of Committee of Diplomatic Relations. We are delighted to show you famous Soviet hospitality. There will be banquet tonight in hotel ballroom, and over next few days, we hope to build trust and admiration for our two great nations. You see those guys over there with the grim looks? KGB minders. Mind them. We know you will enjoy your stay here. As comrade Stalin famously said, "gaiety is most outstanding feature of Soviet Union." So... You and Bridget on the flight, uh, did you two... Yes, we talked. Everything is fine. Good. That is the smallest bathtub I have ever seen. Well, at least there is no hot water. Old-world charm with third-world plumbing. I hope you find amenities to your liking. Oh, well, there are a few things we could use. Oh. Um, soap, maybe. Is there a market nearby? No. No? You cannot leave hotel, not without hospitality ambassador. Oh, and that would be you? Mm-hmm. Have Mayer's Soviet sister. Next she'll want to be checking our girdles. I will arrange tour for ladies, yes? 1400 hours? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wait. Why is not Kate Cameron here? Uh, what? Uh, I'm sorry? I'm sorry. I'm... I'm lost. I was looking... Kate, it's about time. Captain Broyles, I was... W-wondering where you were. Okay? Okay. What did you say to him? I told him that you had a very important client waiting for you. A client? Oh, he thinks I'm going to... Kate, I'm kidding. What are you doing down here, anyway? I must have hit the wrong button on the elevator. The wrong button? What are you doing down here... With all this? A little... Diplomatic relations. Pack of ciggies in Moscow is worth more than a faberge egg. and you brought this all on our flight? Kate, I think you better go back upstairs before your KGB pal comes looking for the menthols. Well, thank you again for opening up your home. Not at all. I'm surprised all these people wanted to venture out on a cold night to hear what I have to say. Oh, ignore him. He's just being modest. Maggie will disagree with me on almost anything. Well, only when you're wrong, which is... often. Ted! Oh, excuse me, please. I didn't know you were going to be here. Uh, neither did I. Uh, apparently, Amanda's parents backed the congressman in his first race. Uh, Amanda, this is Maggie. We work together at Pan Am. Sorry. We walked over, and my hands are freezing. And then Teddy wanted to go for a carriage ride in the park in the middle of November. I thought it'd be romantic. Who are you, and what have you done with Ted Vanderway? Speaking of romantic, you're the last girl I'd ever expect to be on the arm of a republican. You're forgetting, I'm a Pan Am stewardess. I'm trained in diplomacy. Yeah, well, then who are you, and what have you done with Maggie Ryan? In Red Square, you will see notable armory museum and tomb of unknown soldier, honoring brave heroes who won great patriotic war for allies. Olga, uh, do you know where Ostenazenka street is? Ostozhenka. Ostozhenka. It's the street where my grandfather grew up. Your grandfather? He's from Moscow? Uh, well, he lived here until he was 5. Oh. Uh... If we could... if we could just go down this way, uh, I might be able to find his address. Uh, no. Is not on tour. It would mean so much to me and my sister if we could learn more about our Soviet heritage. Mm. This is Communist Party housing, provided free, of course, by glorious decree of presidium. Let's get in a photo. Go. Ready? One, two, three. I didn't do anything. I... Don't touch her. Hey. What... what is he saying? He wants your film. Okay. Laura, just give it to him. But she was only taking a picture of that building. He says it is act of espionage. Espionage? That is ridiculous. They come with us. No. - What? - What? What? Kate. Laura. What's happening? They are being detained for questions. What... what questions? What did they do wrong? They were taking photos. Of a building. A Soviet building, housing many of our illustrious party members. It is not unthinkable your CIA would use stewardesses to gather information. Where are they being held? I cannot tell you this. You... then... Then I need to go to the U.S. embassy. You may not leave hotel. Of course, you are still welcome to our hospitality. So what do we do now? Well, we start by not arguing with useless bureaucrats. Just sit tight. They'll be released soon enough. And you know that for a fact how? I was an army air corps liaison to the russkies during the war. Spent a lot of time with 'em, drank a lot of their vodka, got to know how they think. They have a word... "Zapuguivaniya." What the hell does that mean? Well, it translates loosely... Into "intimidation." They can, uh, keep people on their heels without ever throwing a punch. But they invited us here. No. Some of 'em did. Some didn't. Mistress Olga... she works for the presidium. She doesn't speak for the KGB. But, look, they made their point. It will all blow over. I'm not taking any chances. I want you two to go back up to the room. You pack up Bridget and Laura's things. I'm not gonna risk them planting anything in their bags. Well, I think Rawlings is a shoo-in for '64... No matter what "the Village voice" says. Oh, a bunch of lefty propaganda. I'm surprised Khrushchev isn't on the editorial staff. Did anyone try the rumaki? What do you say we get out of here and go for a walk or something? Um, we just got here. What's gotten into you? Uh, just stuffy, I guess. - Well, take off your coat. - I'm fine. So don't tell me that you believe everything that they print in that rag. Oh, well... The reporting in the "Voice" is actually quite nuanced. "Nuanced"? They said that Rawlings called Goldwater - a fanatic. - Since when is having - an opinion a crime? - Well, since when did communist rhetoric start passing as journalism? Well, maybe Chris doesn't want to march in lockstep with Goldwater and his red-baiting thugs. - What? - I hardly think that... Oh, you hardly think? Well, maybe that's your problem to begin with, you ignorant buffoon. Can I, uh, talk to you for a minute? It doesn't make any sense. Why take Laura and Bridget? It could have just as easily been you or me. They were making a point. Yeah, but to think one of us is a spy. It's... I know. It's ridiculous. Colette? "D. L." Dean Lowrey, right? It could have been here from a long time ago. Yet here it is now... Inside Bridget's suitcase. No one knows where we are. We don't even know where we are. Laura, we are going to get out. Just breathe. Have you had these types of attacks before? The last time was at my wedding. How did you get through it? I ran away. Well, that's not really an option here, but I-I can imagine it must have been terrible. Running out on my fiance? You have no idea. Oh, I didn't... I didn't mean you running out on Dean. I'm so sorry. That's fine. Dean and I will be all right... But you wouldn't have said that two nights ago. Can we keep this between us? Dean and I, in London, we... we had a moment of weakness. You and Dean? What about Colette? I-it just happened, you know. I-I feel awful about it. We go. Where are you taking us? No questions. What the hell was that all about? Well... You told me I should be my wonderful, opinionated self. I said opinionated, not deranged. You just called one of my biggest donors a buffoon. Actually, it was an "ignorant buffoon." It was you. You were the leak behind the "Voice" article. No. I... I mean... Yes. I submitted that article before we started whatever it is that we've started... But you did say all those things. There's a difference between what I say in public and pillow talk. So... You don't actually have any convictions of your own? Oh, I forgot. Your conviction is to get elected. I... I envy the simple universe that you live in. It must be nice having all the answers. I didn't realize having principles made me simple. Thanks for the education. I've been waiting for the right moment, uh, to give this to you, but I-I can't wait anymore. Um... Amanda Hartford Mason, will you marry me? Yes. - Teddy, yes. - Okay. Aw. Ohh. She said yes! Hey. Thank you. Thank you. Let's see the ring. Ohh! - All right. - I'm through waiting. I'm gonna go out and deal with this. Great idea. You two take out the KGB agent. I'll steal a tank. We'll blast our way out. This isn't a John Wayne movie. You're 1,000 miles behind the iron curtain. You can't just go out there guns blazin'. Do you have a better idea? Look, we do not want to make this an international incident. Uh, a-as opposed to what it is now? You know, for the first time since the war, our relations are thawing. You think the Soviets want to screw that up over a couple of stewardesses? That is my sister you are talking about, and I know you know people here, people with connections. Yeah, I have connections, but not the kind to get us out of a situation like this. Yeah? There's no one you can bribe? Couple packs of cigarettes? Your attention, please! I must inform you, trip has been canceled. You will be escorted to airport and depart immediately. No. Hey! I want to talk to somebody that actually has some authority around here. I am sorry. There is nothing that can be done. What about our stewardesses... Bridget Pierce and Laura Cameron? Do not be concerned with them. What the hell does that mean? It means they stay. You go. Maggie? Are you okay? Oh. It's the last time I buy this cheap mascara. Hey, what you said out there... Oh, it was stupid. I have a big mouth. No. I... wish I could be more like you. There's nothing harder than standing up for yourself. You were... Strong and brave and honest. Never apologize for that. Well, then I'll apologize for not being honest. This mascara is not cheap. Men are idiots. I know. Sometimes I think women are just... Better. Me, too. You know who I am? You cannot be here. Please. You must go. I need your help. You cannot come inside. KGB is watching always and listening. Yes. Let me explain. I know why you are here. I have heard about two Pan Am stewardesses detained as spies. And one of them is my sister. They told me that your boyfriend is high up in the Kremlin. You could go to him. That's impossible. What you are saying is suicide. I'm sorry, but I cannot help you. I don't care if it puts you or me in danger. One way or another, you are going to help me, and you are going to do it now. "Albers, Lawrence". "Benson, Scott". "Broyles, George". "Cameron, Kate." "Cameron, Kate." Right here. Right here. Captain Broyles, can I talk to you? "Fineman, Rachel". "Harmon, Gerald." I found someone who can help us get my sister back... Someone high up in the Kremlin. Yeah, sure you did. His name is Vitaly Berzin. He is on the Central Committee... And this is his private number. You're kidding, right? He is willing to intercede, but it's going to take cash and a lot of it, and I know you have it. How does a Pan Am stewardess have connections at the Kremlin? How does a Pan Am pilot smuggle thousands of dollars in black market merchandise across international borders? He's waiting to hear from you. Who are you? I'm a concerned sister. We should all have sisters like you. Bus to airport has arrived. Pazhalsta gather belongings. You leave in two minutes. Why are you not starting engines? Because I'm not flying this plane. Neither is he. This aircraft lacks authorization to stay in Soviet Union. You will only make situation worse. - I don't care about your authorization. - You will fly. And you'll get off of my flight... That won't be necessary. You want to make this situation worse, then you go ahead. Shoot me, 'cause I'm not flying the damn plane. Where are they taking us? I'm not... I'm not sure. There's a KGB interrogation facility outside Lubyanka. Interrogation? They will question us separately. They'll tell you things I said about you. Do not believe them. Okay, I won't. I won't, but how do you know all this? Stay strong. You, too. You have friends in high places. Now you go. Ohh. Oh! I guess we'll have a good story to tell at Thanksgiving. All right, ladies, let's get, uh, wheels up before they change their mind, huh? That was pretty gutsy what you did. Well, I didn't know what else to do. Guess it worked. Yeah. As the Russians say... "Kto ni riskuyet tot ni piyot shampanskava." Translation? "He who doesn't risk never gets to drink champagne." Captain... The left seat is yours. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm happy to inform you we have just left Soviet air space. One minute, we're in the back of the van, and the next, we're at the airport. How did that happen? I guess somebody at Pan Am pulled some strings. You think it was that easy? I have no idea. Well, the worst part is they took my new camera. Thank you. For what? Well, for being, uh... For being patient. Colette, look, there... There's something that I need to tell you. Where did you find this? You tell me. Colette, I don't... I don't want to lie to you ever about anything. Then don't. Say what you need to say. Sync and corrected by dr.jackson for www.addic7ed.com
