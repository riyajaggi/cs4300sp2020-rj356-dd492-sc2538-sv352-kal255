 NARRATOR: Previously onPan Am... You smell like whiskey and cigarettes. You smell like Paris. I don't wanna worry about you and I don't wanna take care of you. Who's asking you to? Well, it ain't much, but it's home. Welcome aboard. My mind is full of you. You follow me like a ghost. Are you in danger? Tito has put an entire nation in danger.

 You want him to spy for you? For us. You want me to turn him? Welcome to the big leagues. [ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] I am a jelly doughnut! [ALL CHEERING] Berlin, right?  The Village Voice. You remember. I hear you have amazing credentials. Ow. [CHUCKLES] You'll have to excuse her. She's been drinking Sloe Gin Fizzes. There is a lot of alcohol in it, but they just taste so good.

 That's an enticing combination. Here. Take mine. [CHUCKLING] She triples the sugar. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Great song. Listen, earlier on the plane... Joe, this is Maggie's friend Sam. Sam is, um... He's into philosophy. Nice to meet you. "We have all been in this white doghouse too long." Excuse me? Malcolm X. Right. [CHUCKLES] You two have fun. Hello, Miss. I seem to have left my lighter at your establishment. I'd like to return it to you, Mr. Lonza, but you'll have to describe it first, make sure it's yours. Smooth. Cool to the touch, hot flame. Why, that describes any old lighter. Well, then I guess, um, I'll have to inspect it. It's definitely yours. You know, when you called in the middle of the night and said, "Come over to my place," this isn't exactly what I expected. Oh? What did you expect? Something that involves a few less people. Well, as far as I'm concerned, Michael, you're the only one in the room. [BOTH LAUGHING] [MAGGIE LAUGHING] LAURA: No. KATE: God. Four times. In a row? [LAUGHS] Mike Ruskin of The Village Voice? Has very impressive credentials. [ALL LAUGHING] Colette, truth or dare? [LAUGHS] Dare. Of course. Mmm-hmm. Something Colette would never do. Mmm. Okay, okay. Oh, got it. Fly the plane. Don't be ridiculous. It has to be something she can actually accomplish. A girl on the  Clipper Horizon made it happen. Really? Mmm-hmm. Yes, and six months later [SING-SONG] she was married to her captain. Mmm. Well, Dean does seem awfully fond of you. Oh, I doubt he's that fond. [LAURA AND MAGGIE CHUCKLING] Fine. Tie a knot in the stem. Hmm. No hands. Oh. Ooh. Now Laura. Okay. Truth. I took nude photos. I was supposed to wait for the question, wasn't I? [MAGGIE AND COLETTE LAUGHING] The Lifemagazine photographer? No. Laura, what were you thinking? I was thinking that I wanted to embrace my sexuality on my terms. Most girls do that with a bottle of a red and a roomy backseat. Maggie! I didn't do that. [LAUGHS] I didn't do that. No, it was... It was about self-expression. And he wasn't the right guy for sex. He was the right guy for nude photos. What, there's a right guy for that? [WOMEN LAUGHING] DEAN: Sorry to interrupt, ladies. I know you girls thought this flight was a freebie, but Pan Am's doing a little favor for Uncle Sam. Shuttling sailors, to be precise, sailors who spent the last six months underwater, so let's clean up the girlie business. Mmm. [CHUCKLES] Is there... Is there something wrong with your mouth? [SNICKERS] Ah. [CHUCKLES] Oh, impressive. Okay. I think we're done here, ladies. [GIGGLING] Help me up. Oh!That's not funny. [ALL CLAMORING] Welcome to Pan Am. Please take a seat in our first class. Welcome. Welcome aboard, sir. Joe. Name's Joe. Welcome to Pan Am. Here you go. Stay dry. Thanks. Best debriefing of the month. Ciao. Ciao. You're leaving? Well, sharing a room only works most of the time. Right. I'll see you tomorrow. Have a good night. Joe. I thought you left already. I hit the head. Listen, you better keep this joint a secret, or every bluejacket and boatswain in the navy is gonna show up in your living room. I'm glad you had fun. Well, um... Good-bye. I thought I was staying the night. Maggie I told me I could have the couch. But if that's a problem... No. No problem at all. Oh. [BELL DINGS] [TELEPHONE RINGS] RICHARD: Hello. Richard, he's leaving Thursday. Kate? They're recalling him back to Yugoslavia. For good. You have to do something. Hello? Hello, Richard? You're with Lonza now? He's in my apartment. I told him I was going out for champagne. You'd better get back. Sit tight. We'll figure something out. [LINE DISCONNECTS] Mind if I leave this open? I kind of miss the taste of fresh air. Of course not. Uh, it might get chilly. [CHUCKLES] Here's hopin'. No such thing as chilly on a submarine. At least let me get you another blanket. Oh, no. This will do fine. If I start freezing to death, I'll come find you. For another blanket. Right. Yes. please do. If you're freezing to death. [CHUCKLES] Laura, thank you for letting me stay. I'm grateful. Good night. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Your drink. I can't believe you made it back here in one piece. Everything all right? How do you mean? You've got a pretty healthy grip on that armrest. [CHUCKLES] [CHUCKLES] Flying makes me a little queasy. I'm not sure rum is the remedy for that. I'm in the navy, ma'am. Rum is the remedy to everything. You don't have to call me "ma'am." My name is Laura. Can't you just close your eyes and pretend this is a submarine? That's what I do when I get nervous. You pretend you're in a submarine? [CHUCKLES] I pretend I'm somewhere else, somewhere I feel safe. Can I ask you somethin'? Private? Sure. Say you and I were close, and I did somethin' to make you mad at me, and we didn't talk for a long time. You think maybe this would make it go easier when I saw you again? It's beautiful. Yeah, but is it enough? In this scenario, am I your girlfriend? Uh, no, sorry. [CHUCKLES] You're my mama. I'm your mama? See, we've always been close, real close. But when I decided to join the navy, she didn't understand, took it personal, thought my leavin' was somehow sayin' Redwater, Mississippi wasn't good enough, that she wasn't good enough, only that wasn't it. You just wanted to see the world. Yeah. Seemed like too big a place not to go wanderin' in it, but she ain't spoke to me since. I send her postcards, but nothin'. I think the hummingbird is beautiful, but I'll bet what she really wants is to know that wherever you go, you still need her, just like before. You don't know my mama. Oh, I think I do. That so? I'm pretty sure my mother could give your mama a run for her money. [CHUCKLES] Uh, my mama don't run nowhere. She just commands from right where she is. [BOTH LAUGHING] LAURA: My mother ambushed me... BOTH: Ooh. Can I help you? I got a little top secret business to discuss. Here? Now? Yeah, we don't have much time. We got a friend over there who is about to surrender himself to the enemy. A defector? Uh, in a manner of speaking. Listen, this is our last chance to give him the send-off he deserves and, uh, [WHISTLES] boy-o, does he love the redheads. Wait. What? Yeah, I ain't askin' for the full Gypsy Rose Lee. Just, you know, toss the hat, drop the jacket, do a little shimmy. Come on. I got a sailor over there who's getting married. He needs a stag party. You want a stripper so badly, you can do it yourself. [SIGHS] And we're out there every day protecting you from the dirty Communists, and we... [SIGHS] You're not a dirty Communist lover, are you? Snow. Well, definitely snow. What's Christmas without snow? [CHUCKLES] And a Douglas fir. Or, um, how do you call it... Spruce? Very well, a spruce, but with colored lights. Or maybe only white. Hey, I'm giving in on the spruce. Yeah, 6 or 7 feet tall, which I will cut down myself. [CHUCKLES] from the forest behind the house? Mmm-hmm. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Are you expecting someone? At 1:00 in the morning? Oh. It could be the neighbors. [CHUCKLES] The wife kicks him out a lot. Kate, get on your fire escape. What? We don't even know who it is.Exactly. Niko, it's raining outside. [KNOCKING CONTINUES] Okay, before I get drenched, can I at least check the peephole? Mrs. Luckovich? I saw your light on, or I wouldn't bother you. Is something wrong? Do you have a hot water bottle I can borrow? My arthritis is acting up. Of course. Come in. [WHISPERS] It's my nosy neighbor. Do you still want me out the window? [WHISPERS] There's a first time for everything. It's all right. No! We're here to pick up your package. Is he armed? No, you don't need to. You don't need to. NIKO: Kate! Hello, Mr. Lonza. Kate, do you know these men? No. [INHALES DEEPLY] Not exactly. I think it's time you made some new friends. I have all the friends I need. You never know. Let's take a ride, get acquainted. I don't like to go out in rain. Well, you're gonna have to get over that. Hey. KATE: Wait. No! No, wait! [GROANS] No! No, wait! Trust me. We're your only way out. Get off me! Niko, please. Go with them. They want to help. Who are you? No! Morning. You cleaned up. And you put a roof over my head. [CHUCKLES] Hangover? Got just the thing. You like eggs? Hot sauce? Orange juice? Molasses? Sounds delicious. I call it the Redwater special. After your hometown. No, 'cause it looks like red water. [CHUCKLES] Straight from the mighty banks of the Mississippi to cure what ails you. Down the hatch? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] I should get that. Where's Maggie Ryan? Depends. [CHUCKLES] Can I help you? I'm the super. You responsible for last night's little shindig? That also depends. On what? On how mad you are about it. You living here? No. Yes. no. Well, temporarily. Uh, at least it was temporary, but it's actually been working out very well, so... And who is he? Joe? Um, he's a guest. Your guest? Sort of. Kick him out.Excuse me? You're not on the lease, and I don't like your guest. Kick him out, or I kick you out, and no more parties. You understand? I'll ask him to leave. You're not gonna drink that, are you? I'm not that hungry. [CHUCKLES] What time is your train? Not until 6:00. What do you say we go buy your ticket and then wander the city a little? Oh, you don't need to do that for me. Listen, I know you were trying to avoid me last night... Avoid? No. And I deserve it for what I did on the plane. I was a little drunk, and I forgot, for a moment, how things are. Joe, I would... I would really like to spend the day with you. I'd like that, too. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Coffee, please. I've been here 45 minutes. I've had a busy morning. I can't always drop everything when you call. Well, you managed to rustle a lynch mob last night when I called. He's safe. You did your job. What's the emergency? Why didn't you tell me that you were pulling him out of my apartment? Have you forgotten the concept of "need to know"? I could have talked him into a meeting. Turning a diplomat is a delicate procedure. Yes, you were real delicate last night. The last thing I need is your personal attachment complicating matters. My personal attachment? The only shot you have at this is my personal attachment. No. We have more than that. What? Don't you have an around-the-world flight coming up? Go. Enjoy yourself. Richard, I want to see him. You've done your part. Forget about Niko Lonza. We've got it from here. Richard, no. No, no. Take me with you. I need to explain my side of things. No, you don't. Please. I can help. Richard, I need to talk to him! LAURA: Under the Yum Yum Tree. [CHUCKLES] No. You don't even know what it's about. I know what it's called.[CHUCKLES] Well, are you sure you want to see a movie? We could go to Central Park, the Statue of Liberty. My mama would call you happy as a dead pig in the sun. That's not very nice. It means you don't know any better than to smile. It's a good thing. I tell you what. Why don't you wait here? I'll go grab my ticket, and then we'll see the tasty tree movie. Yum Yum. Don't remind me. You're beautiful, you know that? Thank you. $19, sir. What do you say I buy you lunch? I'm fine. Thank you. Oh, come on. I'm a nice guy. Laura, let's go. Now what makes you think you can order a lady around like that? Oh, he wasn't ordering me. It's okay, Laura. No, it's not okay. This... This is not okay at all. Come on. Joe. Joe! Joe! Joe! Yes, Crown Heights. I got it. [SIGHS] Richard, is he all right? [LINE DISCONNECTS] [GASPS] [GASPS] Oh, thank goodness you're home. Oh, my God! I... We... We were a few blocks away, and I didn't know where else to go. What happened? For the record, a couple of them look worse than me. Them? You got in a fight with multiple people? It's all my fault. Stop that. It's only mostly your fault. [SIGHS] Kate. I don't have any bandages or tincture of iodine. Can you run to the drugstore? [SIGHS] No. Laura, I have to go. Go where? I'm sorry. I'll explain later. [MEN CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MEN EXCLAIMING] [LAUGHING] Right there. Lookin' at you. Where is the groom? Oh, yeah, baby. [MEN CHEERING] What the hell is going on out there? I don't even want to know. Oh, it is nothing. Kate's taking off her clothes to entertain the men. And why would she do that? Feeling patriotic, I guess. What does a guy gotta do to get a decent cup of coffee around here? Oh, but it's just... Oh, don't bother, Colette. I'll get my own. Okay. I like coffee, too. Mmm. Sure. Yeah. Run along, boys. I'll stay, fly the plane. Oh, no need to be jealous. I said Kate was taking her clothes off, but I didn't say who was putting them on. Oh. Sailors. If you want a quick look, I'd be happy to take over. No, thank you. I'm happy right where I am. Too bad. It's always been a dream of mine to fly. [MEN SHOUTING] Excuse me, First Officer Valois, could you please take your seat? [GIGGLES] You know, there's actually some gray area here. The singing guardians of democracy back there are not technically paying passengers. And they're sworn to protect your right to the pursuit of happiness. Oh, this would make me very happy. Yeah? Yeah. [SIGHS] Both hands on the yoke. The yoke? Yeah, the steering wheel. Roger that, Captain. [BEEPING] I'm flying? [LAUGHS] And a dream comes true. I'm flying. Guys, guys. Hey. Ensign Will Finely is gonna get himself married. [ALL CHEERING] To Will! My mama always says, you carry your first impression of a person for the rest of your days. It becomes a part of you, like a photograph in your pocket. Which is why I deeply regret, the first time I met Will Finely, he had dysentery. [ALL LAUGHING] MAN: Aw, Will! Now that's a hell of a photograph to be stuck with forever. To Will. ALL: To Will. You're missing a pretty good speech. You could use a lecture. Oh, you're a lifesaver. I am starving. What? Nude photographs? I don't plan on showing anyone. Doesn't matter. They exist. Do you have the negatives? I thought you, of all people, would understand. Have you not read the Pan Am code of ethics? And every practical reason aside, you're not the kind of girl who does that. Well, I must be, because I did, and I'm not going to apologize for it. And quite frankly, that sounds like something mother would say. Nude photos it is. What's going on, Kate? For a while you seemed so happy, but lately you're... On edge. Boy trouble. Since when have you had a boy? Since Monte Carlo. No. No. The one you stole from Maggie? Please. Maggie never stood a chance. [LAUGHS] What's he like? [SIGHS] He's sweet and funny, kind and... He's noble. Oh, my God. You're in love. I'm in over my head is what I am. My boyfriend's a Yugoslavian Communist. He's a communist?Now who sounds like mother? You're right. Who cares?The free world. But you're in love. Nothing else matters. Hey, don't let that go. It's complicated. No, it's simple. It's a dime, a phone booth, and a handful of words. Call him as soon as we touchdown, and tell him that love trumps everything. I can't. No arguing. Laura. Kate, no arguing. Apparently your personal attachment is stronger than we thought. He won't talk any more until he sees you. You have him here? We use an insurance office as a front. It actually turns a profit. Be careful. It's not going well. What a surprise. He's through here. I don't suppose you could offer me any privacy? I can offer you this. He's angry, you're angry. But what he wants for his country and what we want from him do, indeed, run parallel. You need to make him believe that. Kate. I've misled you. I've withheld from you, but I haven't lied to you. [SIGHS] Is Kate your real name? Yes. Is anything else about you real? I started as a courier. This is beyond anything that I ever thought that I would be doing for them. Oh, clearly they can spot talent. You had me convinced. Niko, you and I... That part was real. [CLICKS] KATE: Niko, are you in danger? NIKO: Tito has put an entire nation in danger. Chief Architect of the Second Yugoslavia, and yet his dreams are not for his people. [SIGHS] I must go and try to help my cousin. This might be the last time I'll ever see him again. Niko... My mind is full of you, too. [CLICK] Very convincing. [INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY] [VOICE BREAKS] I meant it. But it wasn't just between us. I didn't know. Did you record everything? I didn't know. Congratulations. You are now a professional. Don't be cruel. My new friends here, they have a terrific proposition. I return back to Yugoslavia as a double agent or explain this tape, made in the bed of an American agent, to our secret police. [WHISPERS] But I thought... I thought when they told me that they wanted you to help us that that meant that you would stay in New York. At your current job. Doing what? Passing information, but here, where you could be protected! No, sweetheart, it means being sent back to spy on a government that is already suspicious of me. [WHISPERING] I'm so sorry. [SNIFFLES] I thought I was helping. This is helping? I thought you meant the things that you said on that tape, that you wished your country had the same freedoms as America. Well, it's still my country! [POUNDS TABLE] And it needs to change. You believe that! [EXHALES DEEPLY] If you could work... [CRYING] If you could work with us. [SIGHS] This is not "working with." This is a death sentence. [SOBBING] Niko. Niko, please. Hear them out. I do not like what they've done, but I believe that you want the same [WHISPERS] things. I... I honestly can't tell. Are you... Are you just a silly, naive girl or... Or a master liar? Both. I'm both. But I am also yours. [MEN SINGING INDISTINCTLY] This is getting out of hand. It's like feeding time at the zoo. Can you imagine being trapped underwater with them for six months? I'd load myself into a torpedo tube and launch. That bad? My kingdom for a sedative. How snockered are they? What are you thinking? Nifty little pilot trick. I'm gonna decrease the cabin pressure by manually raising the cabin altitude. I love Greek. Beautiful language. It makes boozy passengers fall asleep. You're kidding. No. That's why test pilots don't drink on game day. Pilots and their secrets. KATE: Well, what are you waiting for? Joe, we're asking everybody to return to their seats. [SNIFFLES] Is it okay if I stay back here? Sure, as long as you buckle up. Still unsettled? You could say that. I liked your toast. [CHUCKLES] Where's the wedding? Alabama. Oh, that's convenient. Right on the way home. Yes, it is. [SIGHS] Is it a church wedding? It's a country club. Well, that will be nice. Exclusive country club. Oh. But thanks to you, I've got a secret weapon. Gonna close my eyes and pretend my ass right into the front row. Upset all those old ladies. [CHUCKLES] Get those fans going. I, um... [CHUCKLES] I should probably take the bottle before Maggie catches you. [CHUCKLES] It's against the rules. I need to, uh, prepare for landing. Does it hurt? [SIGHS] You want the truth or the tough guy answer? [SIGHS] I am so sorry. Hey. It was hardly a tussle. I knew hittin' the town with you would draw some eyes. That's on me. I'm sorry because... Because it isn't right. It isn't right that... When you tried to kiss me, I cared what other people would think. It isn't right that when I went to bed last night, I locked my door. It isn't right that when the super told me to kick you out, I did it. You took my hand in front of those men at the train station. And you brought me back here to take care of me. That counts for something. That mean old man really told you to kick me out? Don't worry. I plan on flooding the bathtub. Isn't it Maggie's apartment? [BOTH CHUCKLING] Where I work, we call that a command decision. Why are you being nice to me? Same reason I tried to kiss you. [CHUCKLES] Same reason I told Maggie I had nowhere else to stay last night. That was a lie? That was a desperate attempt to keep your company a little longer. Why? You ever been on a submarine? There's a lot of gray. Gray pumps, gray engines, gray gauges, gray steel... A big gray ocean tryin' to crush you like a tin can... So you can imagine what it's like to come up from all that gray and see... You. [WHISPERS] Laura, what are you doing? [WHISPERS] Making another command decision. [CHUCKLES] [WHISPERS] Is something funny? [CHUCKLES] You're the guy. And the next time I have to close my eyes to feel safe... I'm gonna pretend I'm right here. I remember my first trip around the world. I took a little spoonful of dirt from every place we landed as a souvenir. You must be excited. Beyond. Oh, I have bills to mail. I'll be right down. Okay, make it snappy. It's time to board. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Kate. Where on Earth have you been? I know. I haven't returned your calls. Is everything all right? The way you ran out on Joe and I... Kate Cameron? Phone call. I need to mail these. Kate speaking. [RECEIVER CLATTERS] Kate? Kate, what is it? [SIGHS] Excuse me. Are you lost? I, uh, seem to have found my way. Which flight is yours? Pan Am 2. Around the world. I'd like to do that. Mine is leaving in, um, two hours. Flight 22. London. And then on to Yugoslavia. I was supposed to be leaving, uh, two days ago, but then I got delayed. Job interview. I thought you weren't interested in a new job. I didn't care for the interview. But then we, uh, resolved our differences. There are people who need me in Yugoslavia, and it's time. So this is your choice. Things rarely happen the way we expect. I'm beginning to understand that. So you'll let me know when you book a return? It's likely to be a long trip. Well, the only thing left to do is, um, to say good-bye to my American girlfriend. She'll be devastated. At first. Maybe. But then she'll understand that I'm doing what I must. That I'm, uh, I'm "walking like a man." I hope she'll be proud of me. She already is. [GIGGLES] Laura? Um, you go. Good-bye, Kate. [SNIFFLES] Your layover in London... There's a great pub in Cadogan Square. Oh, it's a... It's a good spot for billiards. I'll... I'll try to remember that. Hey, Kate. [SNIFFLES] Me, too. [SIGHS] [BREAK IT TO ME GENTLY PLAYING] â™ª Break it â™ª To me gently â™ª Let me down â™ª The easy way â™ª Make me feel â™ª That you still love me â™ª If it's just â™ª If it's just for one more day â™ª Break it â™ª To me gently MAGGIE: No plants, no animals, no men.

I'll do it. â™ª 'Cause I'll never Just smile through it, dear. â™ª Love again Oh. Here they come. Are you ready, Kate? Mmm-hmm. [LATCH CLICKS] â™ª Love Welcome to Pan Am. â™ª Again Hello.
