 Once in London, Ted enlists Laura's help to try to make an old flame - Amanda Mason - jealous, but things don't go the way he expects. Meanwhile, Kate attempts to regain her freedom from her courier duties by agreeing to one last mission for her British contact, but the dangerous assignment not only puts her life in jeopardy but Anderson's as well; Maggie butts heads with a hawkish congressman who disagrees with her political views, but things really heat up when she tries to change his mind about his beliefs and ends up sparking an attraction with him; and back at home, Dean takes Colette to meet his parents and the two discover feelings that have been brewing for a long time.

 NARRATOR: Previously on Pan Am... Look, I get to see the world, Sam. When was the last time you left the village? I don't need to see the world to change it. (ENGINE ROARS) Marry me! I can't say yes now. Pan Am stewardess can travel all around the world without suspicion. You volunteered for this. They will let you out. Are you going my way? Sometimes the stars align. You're different from other girls.

 Thank you. KENNEDY: (AMPLIFIED VOICE) And democracy is not perfect. (KNOCK ON DOOR) You're casting a shadow, Kate. I take it you missed the signal? Stood me up at the park. I didn't miss it. Are you gonna invite me in? We had our exit interview. Well, it doesn't work that way, Kate. It's like a marriage. Saying "yes" is the easy part. Now would be a good time to invite me in. Nosy neighbors. I have a job for you. No. (TURNS LOCK)

 No more jobs, no more mysterious packages, no more betrayals. I'm going to London. Just hear me out, Kate. And if I don't, what? This time I get dragged away by the men in trench coats? (SIGHS) There's a dealer in London who's gotten ahold of a list of names. CIA assets. He's selling that list to the Soviets. I told you, no. All you need to do is deliver this to your contact in London. Inside is a counterfeit list. Anderson will take care of the rest. (SIGHS DEEPLY) (WHISPERS) Anderson. (NORMAL VOICE) And what if I refuse? I'm gonna make this plain for you, Kate. Your exit from the agency can go a few different ways, a simple matter of a little paperwork and a handshake, or we can make this your last mission... And your last flight. You would really cost me my job at Pan Am? I'll do whatever I have to, to get this done. Just like you did with Bridget? (GROOVY SONG PLAYING) Here. Oh, thank you. (KNOCK ON DOOR) (RHYTHMIC KNOCKS) Sam? Hey, Mags, sorry I'm late. Late for what? You know, hitting the wild blue yonder, crossing the pond. (IMITATES BRITISH ACCENT) Chip chip cheerio and all that rot. Sam, what are you doing here? I'm leaving for London in two hours. I know. I'm going with you. Remember? Oh! Hi, Sam. Laura. Good look. Think you can sneak me into first class? (SIGHS) Sam, I... Do not do this to me, Maggie. You promised you'd get me to London. (MOUTH FULL) What's in London? The World Atomic Symposium, biggest gathering of death merchants on the planet. "Ban the Bomb" UK is gonna crash their little war fest, and I've got a spot on the front lines. How long have... (NORMAL VOICE) How long have you been part of the "Ban the Bomb" movement? Since saving mankind from extinction became a moral imperative. I think that is very noble. I mean, what could be more important than saving the world? How about saving my job? Won't be any job left when the world winds up in a pile of radioactive ash. (SCOFFS) Come on, Maggie. You owe me. Dean? You better get a move on. We're flying in two hours. Is this how it works, you kiss a girl once and you become her chauffer? Actually, it was you who kissed me. Oh, then maybe I should drive you, which will give you a chance to put on your uniform. I said we're flying, not flying Pan Am. Well, you said you wanted to learn. With these? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. It's a Stearman PT-17. Crop duster. Same plane I learned to fly on. A crop duster? You are getting your wings today. Who's in First Class today? Earl of Halifax, two movie stars, and a United States Congressman. A Congressman? Who? Oh. Christopher Rawlings. I hear he's very handsome. I'm not worried about how he looks. You mean Sam? No, the Earl. I'm sure he'll be on his best behavior. Then you don't know Sam. Listen, you've gotta help me keep an eye on him. If anyone finds out about this... Find out about what? Uh, VIP on our London flight, a Congressman Rawlings. Oh, great man. Met him at a fund-raiser last year. Let me guess. Fat cats for progress? Hysterical. Let's just make sure the Congressman gets the VIP treatment today, okay? Emphasis on the "V." Aye aye, Captain. Oh, no, you're not our Captain. Where is Dean? Called in sick. Huh. Must be something going around. Colette's sick, too. Who's Dean's replacement? (PEN CLATTERS) Captain Thornton. Dennis Thornton? You know him? Captain on my very first round-the-world. Two weeks of war stories and wandering hands. Steer clear. (ENGINES ROARING) Ladies. KATE AND LAURA: Captain. I'm sorry, but, uh, your hat is where? Oh. The hat pin broke. I was just trying to fix it. I don't care about your excuses, Miss... Cameron. Laura Cameron. Next time I see you out of uniform, you'll be written up. He always does that. Don't let it get to you. How? That man is awful. Ugh. Tell me about it. Six hours of World War II stories to look forward to. Remind me to kill Dean next time I see him. You're jeopardizing the life of every living being on this planet! Whoa. It's murder on a worldwide scale! I mean, when are you people gonna realize that nuclear weapons are nothing but a death sentence for the human race? Sir! You need to calm down. SAM: You need to get your hands off me, flyboy! Sorry about this, Congressman. We're gonna take care of this right away. It's okay, Captain. Let him talk. It's a free country. Well, actually, I'm the First Officer. Uh, Ted Vanderway. We met at, uh, midtown fund-raiser. Of course. Good to see you again. (CHUCKLES) Yes. What are you, the president of his fan club? Sir, you need to take your seat. Hey, Maggie, get this guy off of me. TED: Wait, you know this guy? (CHUCKLES) (ENGINES ROARING) Stay here and don't move, don't talk, and if possible, don't even breathe. Mags, come on. Do you know who that was? You're talking and breathing. Christopher Rawlings, Congressman Warmonger himself. So? So he's probably on his way to the symposium. This is our big chance. Your chance to be the nice, respectful passenger you promised to be. But I... No "buts." For once in your life, Sam, just try to fit in. You mean like you? I am my principles, Maggie. I can't separate that from who I am. Yep. (SIGHS) That was my 44th mission in my P-38 Lightning. That little gem of a plane was practically a part of me. They don't make 'em like that anymore. All this...clutter. No maneuverability. Anyway, the frogs were hunkered down outside of Bayeux, and only the Jerries were on the road. So, if something moves, we're supposed to just light it up. (TED GROANS) Coffee, gentlemen? Oh, bless you. I'll let you know when coffee is served. Dismissed. Um... Scoot, missy. That'll be all. (LAUGHS) (MOUTHS WORD) So anyway, I spotted this convoy of Jerry trucks, and I'm thinking to myself, "Hey, this is my lucky day. I'm gonna take 'em all out." I can't believe we're hooking. (LAUGHS) We're not... We're not "hooking." Playing hooky. What you just said means something else entirely. What did I say? It involves charging by the hour. Oh! Uh, no. (LAUGHS) Ahem. The apples look beautiful. Yeah. McIntosh. My mom's favorite. We'll bring her a dozen. Your mother? Yeah. No, I thought we were going flying. We are. Here you go. Thank you. Crop duster belongs to my father. He keeps it behind the barn. I'm going to meet your parents? It's no big deal. We always had people stopping by, friends, neighbors. My high school baseball team practically lived there. Oh, Dean, I'm not sure. Isn't this a little different? It'll be fun. You know, we'll have lunch, exchange pleasantries. (STARTS ENGINE) And then... We'll fly. Congressman Rawlings, I am so sorry about what happened with that man. Oh, it's okay. Everyone's entitled to an opinion, even if it's completely wrong. Well, please allow me to offer you a free drink, courtesy of Pan Am. I thought they were already free. But this one's coming from me. Well, I wish I could, but, uh, it'll put me right to sleep. Big speech tomorrow. The World Atomic Symposium? You've heard of it? You'd be surprised at the things I've heard of. Well, I don't doubt that. I bet you've got a few surprises under that cute blue hat. (TAPPING FOOT) (MOUTHS WORD) (TONES CHIME) I'll get it. (TRAY CLATTERS) This is Laura. Right away, Captain. Captain Bligh wants his coffee. (CHUCKLES) Do you want me to bring it? No, thank you. I can do it. (SWITCHES CLICK) You wanted coffee, Captain? Oh, thank you, Lori. It's Laura, sir. Uh, would you do me a favor, honey? Uh, this damn air speed gauge is fogged up. Uh, would you mind cleaning it for me? Of course not. Aah! God! What the hell? Oh! I... I am so sorry. It... It must be the turbulence. You get her off of my flight deck right now, Vanderway. You should probably, um... What an idiot. Laura, why are you hiding back here? We're ready to go. Me? I'm... I'm not hiding. DENNIS: Miss Cameron! (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) Miss Cameron! You think you're pretty clever with that little coffee stunt, huh? No, sir, I didn't... Well, I hope the London Base Manager appreciates your sense of humor because I'm filing paperwork for disciplinary action. Captain, I'm sorry if I... Oh, you'll be sorry, all right. TED: Captain. Can I speak to you for a moment? Not now. Well, actually, sir, it has to be right now. (LAUGHS) (STIFLES LAUGH) Please tell me it was piping hot. (LAUGHING) Oh, you're my hero. Shh! (SPEAKING INAUDIBLY) LAURA: What is Ted doing? Oh, probably making it worse. (LAUGHS) (MEN SPEAKING INAUDIBLY) What happened? What did you say to him? Oh, I told him he could take that paperwork and shove it right up his cargo hold. You didn't. (LAUGHS) No, but it's taken care of. Ted, thank you. No, thank you. After that little trick you pulled, that blowhard didn't say a word for the last thousand miles. No, I really owe you. Well, that's good to hear, uh, 'cause I'm ready to collect. Oh, please. I'm not a total cad all the time. Then what is it? It's not a what, it's a who. Amanda Hartford Mason. You want my help with a girl? Uh-huh. MAN: * There are girls * Just right for some kissing * And I mean * To kiss me a few * Oh, those girls don't know... Let's move a little faster, ladies. This place is crawling with lobby lizards. I've never seen so many in one place. It's the uniform. It turns grown men to mush. Seems to cause memory problems, too. They all forget they're married. (LAUGHS) Laura, grab my key for me. I need to make a call. * 'Cause time is a-wastin' * I've got a lot of livin' to do Pardon me. Would you happen to have a cigarette? I seem to have left mine in the other jacket. (RECEIVER CLATTERS) Yes, of course. (UNZIPS BAG) Very good. Thank you. Okay. I've done my job. Hold on, Kate. What? Richard said I give you the case and I'm through. I'm through. Hardly. The mission's changed. You're just getting started. There's been a hitch, Kate. I did what I was asked. Whatever the hitch is, it's not my problem. You don't understand. This is an urgent situation. The list was to be delivered to the Soviets three days from now. Instead, they're coming for it tonight. I've had to improvise. I need you to be my decoy. Decoy for what? A certain jeweler. Cyrus Bolger. In his possession is the actual list, not this fake that you've supplied to us. Our people are going to break into his safe and switch the two. And how exactly do you suppose I decoy this Mr. Bolger? Simply by being yourself, a Pan Am stewardess. I, however... (SETS DOWN BOTTLE) Will be Mr. Caldwell down from Liverpool... (POURS LIQUOR) Here to close a business deal... (IMITATES SCOUSE ACCENT) And get reacquainted with my favorite stewardess. Well, at least I'm your favorite. (NORMAL VOICE) Caldwell likes to buy expensive baubles for his paramour. That's our entree to the jeweler. I told you, I'm not interested. Understood, but you may be familiar with some of the names on that list. Do I have your interest now? Who's on that list? Bridget Pierce. Among others. And Niko Lonza? He's at the top. Let me walk you through the mission. (SHIFTS GEAR) (TURNS OFF ENGINE) This is it. (CHUCKLES) Don't worry. you look great. Nobody looks great after a hundred miles in a convertible. They are gonna love you. I just wasn't expecting to... Hey... I didn't tell you because I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. Mmm. Okay? Dean! Bill, it's Dean! (LAUGHS) Hiya, Mom. Hi. Oh. Oh. Mmm. Bill, they're here! I can see 'em, Marjorie. (LAUGHS) I've got eyes. (SIGHS) Oh. And this must be Bridget. No. (CHUCKLES) Uh... Mom, Pop, this is, uh, this is Colette. Oh, dear. Colette. Well... (CHUCKLES) Mr. and Mrs. Lowrey, it's a pleasure to meet you both. You're French? Oui. Oh. Colette and I work together. She's, uh, she's a Pan Am stewardess. BOTH: Oh. So what happened to Bridget? Well, come on in, you two. Let's have some lunch. Yes. (CHUCKLES) (WOMEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Oh. Amanda Mason was the bane of my adolescence. This girl was a cross between Grace Kelly and...and an ice cube. She wouldn't give you the time of day? She wouldn't give me the month. She wouldn't give me the year, for that matter. Anyway, our parents are best friends, weekends in East Hampton and all that, and Amanda, oh, went out of her way to make my life absolutely miserable. She was mean to you? No, worse. She ignored me. And you're going out with this girl why? Sneak attack from the parents. "Oh, Edward. You're going to be in London at the same time." Blah, blah, blah. (CHUCKLING) "Oh, what a wonderful coincidence." Your parents call you Edward? (SIGHS) When they're trying to ruin my life, which is always. (CHUCKLES) Okay. What do you want me to do? I want you to be my girlfriend. I made a reservation at 7:30 at the hotel dining room. At 8:00, you come over to our table, steaming mad at me, which shouldn't be much of a stretch for you, but you gotta come at me with both barrels, you know? Hey, you can wear that little black number, the one that shows off your... Okay, Ted, I agreed to this favor reluctantly. You can't tell me what to wear. Fair enough. You could just tell your parents no. (CHUCKLES) Way too complicated. But having me pretend to be your deranged girlfriend makes sense? Yeah. Glad you see it my way. (PATS BACK) (CHUCKLES) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (PIANO PLAYING JAZZ) Sam, what are you doing here? I thought you'd be filling Molotov cocktails by now. No, the only cocktail I'm filling... Emptying... (SIGHS) Is right here. What happened to "Ban the Bomb" UK? Oh. Arrested. (SIGHS) Locked up. Thrown in the pokey. Oh. Sam, I'm so sorry. Well, it's a good thing you weren't with them. How can you say that? I should have been with them. You wanted to get arrested? If that's what was necessary. You can't effect change without personal sacrifice. How is going to jail the answer? You talk about seeing the world to change it, Maggie, but you're just another tourist. I am not. You meet important people in your job. When was the last time you talked to them... (SIGHS) Really talked to them? I talk to people all the time. Sure, to take a lunch order. You have a captive audience at 35,000 feet, and you won't take advantage of it. (SLURPS) You could make a difference... (CLATTERS) But you don't. (UTENSILS CLINKING) Paris must be the most beautiful city in the world. What was it like growing up there? Well, actually, Mom, she's, uh, she's from the countryside, so... Oh. So, yeah, not so different from here. Oh. Yeah. And how long have you two been flying together? Well, we've been on the same crew for a few months. Yeah. She... She speaks four different languages... Oh. And she makes, uh, this, um, it's a Tart... Tarte tatin? (FRENCH ACCENT) Tarte tatin. (LAUGHS) It's, uh... (LAUGHS) French. It's...yeah. It tastes exactly like your apple cobbler. So good. Uh, hold on here. I don't want to point out the elephant in the room, but I have to ask. What the hell happened to Bridget? Bill. Dad. (SIGHS) Nothing personal, Colette, but the last time my son was here, he told us he was getting engaged to a girl named Bridget. Hey, Dad. Can we talk about this later? It's always later with you. You didn't call us when you left the Air Force. You didn't tell us when you took the Pan Am job, and now you're jetting around God-knows-where. How are we supposed to know what's going on with you? I'm here now. Isn't that good enough? On what occasion? You two getting engaged? Bill, please. (CHUCKLES) No. Are you expecting? No. DEAN: Come on. MARJORIE: Bill! As I live and breathe! I'm sorry. Would you excuse me? Oh. What are you thinking? (BIRDS CHIRPING) Colette, listen. (CHUCKLES) You gotta... understand about my parents. Take me home, Dean. Come on. I thought you wanted to learn how to fly. I think I've learned enough for one day. I'm sorry. I'm... You know, I never really expected today to go like this. Well, how did you think it would go? You would pretend I was Bridget until your parents figured it out? No, I... I figured they'd meet you, and...and they'd think you're fantastic, like I do, and... And the embarrassment of breaking up with your fiancee would be ignored? (SIGHS) Okay. I messed up. I'm sorry. Can we start over? No. It's not that simple. Look, I realize how awkward that was back there, but you gotta understand that that has nothing to do with us. Us? (CHUCKLES) I don't think there is an "us," Dean. You're still in love with Bridget. No. Yes. No. Yes. That's why you didn't tell your parents. You still imagine she'll show up one day like nothing happened, like she never left you. And you're so sure that every guy that you fall for is gonna up and leave you for another woman. I'm not going to let myself get hurt again. So then why would you kiss me in Miami? Honestly, I don't know. Just take me home. No. No. Please take me home. No. Why... Why not? Because you're asking... Let go. (SIGHS) You're asking the wrong damn question. You want to know why I never told my parents that I broke up with Bridget. (PANTING) Well, for the same reason that I never brought her up here to meet them. There's just something about her that wasn't real, but after two weeks, I brought you. So I'm real? Yeah. This is real. Dean. (INHALES DEEPLY) (PANTING) They're beautiful. Yes. Well, just last week, the Duchess of Argyll was in, admiring the very same pieces. (GASPS) The Duchess? See, I do have good taste. Well, it might be a little excessive, though. Darling, after all I do for you, aren't I worth it? Well, I suppose they do go with your eyes. (MEN CHUCKLE) Can I try the diamond chips again? Of course, madam. There we are. Oh. Oh, it's perfect. Mmm. Of course, it'll have to be sized for me. Oh, we can do that for you. It... It will be ready tomorrow morning. Oh, no. (SIGHS) I'm a stewardess for Pan Am, and our flight leaves early tomorrow. Perhaps you could bring it by our hotel later this evening, say, 8:00? If it wouldn't be too much of an imposition. Of course not. (GASPS) (CHUCKLES) Oh! You are so good to me. (CHUCKLES) Mmm. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Wow. Laura, you look... Wait. You can't meet the Ice Princess with your tie all cockeyed. (CHUCKLES) Thanks. Now don't forget, 8:00. You come marching in, and you make a scene. Give me full-on Liz Taylor. Cleopatra or Butterfield 8? Whatever's crazier. I could throw a drink on you. Pretty good at that. (LAUGHS) I don't know why I'm so nervous about this. I'm a Pan Am pilot, for God sake. If I can make 200,000 pounds of metal fly, I can handle a half-hour of misery, right? For the record, you're not just a pilot. You're a decent man, and she is going to regret the day she ever let you get away. (WHISPERS) You should go. (CLATTERS) (CHAIR SCRAPES FLOOR) Congressman Rawlings? I'm Maggie Ryan, your Pan Am stewardess. Of course. How could I forget? (CHUCKLES) Well, I wanted to apologize again for the trouble on the flight. That's not necessary, Miss Ryan. Maggie. Maggie. It comes with the territory. Can't have a circus without a clown or two. (CHUCKLES) Congressman, if you don't mind my saying so, your position on nuclear weapons, it's wrongheaded. We need a testing ban. Well, that's an awfully simplistic view of things. So you're saying that 11 of our greatest atomic scientists, including Einstein, are simplistic? Einstein didn't have to man a sentry post in Korea and stare down the Chinese army. And you did? Yes. Look, I support regulation, but banning nuclear weapons testing is just plain naive. Well, I bet I can change your mind. No, you can't... (SIGHS) But I'll give you three flights of stairs to try. Okay. Every industrialized nation known... Take the Cuban missile crisis. (SWITCH CLICKS) Take it where? The perfect example of the need for better dialogue between the superpowers. Dialogue? Have you met Khrushchev? No. (CHUCKLES) Arrogant. Lots of ear hair. Right. Of course. You know Khrushchev. (CHUCKLES) Well... My point was...is... You realize you're in my room. Well, that's 'cause I haven't finished yet. (CHUCKLES) What's this? Cognac. VSOP. I know what it is. I'm not here for a nightcap. Indulge me. You're not going to make your argument with this. And you're not going to make yours without it. Enough of my job. (SIGHS) Tell me about traveling the world. You must have seen some pretty exotic places. Sure. Potsdam, Yalta, Hiroshima... (SNORTS) (CHUCKLES) What was that? What? You snorted. (CHUCKLES) No, I didn't. That was definitely a snort. Uh... (SIGHS) A... A chortle. Maybe a chuckle. You're not taking me seriously, are you? You've made it this far, and I haven't called security. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Teddy? Teddy. (GASPS) Uh... (CHUCKLES) Oh, it's been... Ooh. Years. Forever. (CHUCKLES) Uh, yeah. (CHUCKLES) Look at you. Huh? You've got shoulders. Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES) Well, once I learned scrawny was no longer in style. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) It's so good to see you, Teddy. Yeah. Mmm. You always were so funny. (CHUCKLES) Oh. Yeah. Well... Now I'm funny with shoulders, apparently. (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) Yeah. Yeah. Um, uh, please. (CHUCKLES) Uh, yeah. (WHISPERS) Yeah. (SIGHS) We've been over this. I know what to do. A half-hour. That's all the time I need to switch the lists. And this is it for me? I do this, and I'm out? Yes. Yes, you are out. There he is, right on time. He's on his way up to you. Kate. What? Stick to the mission. I know how to be a stewardess. I mean about us, our story. Don't worry, Spencer. I'll be fine. Spencer? I gave you a first name. Hello? Be careful, Kate. (KNOCK ON DOOR) He's here. Go. (RECEIVER CLATTERS) Good evening. Evening. I have the bracelet. Oh, come in. It's so kind of you to bring it here. Diamonds are expensive, but service is priceless. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I can't wait to try it on. Well, the sizing was a little more difficult than I thought, but I think you will like it. Mmm. Oh, very nice accommodations for a stewardess. Yes. I don't usually have a room this big, but Mr. Caldwell... Well, he insists on the best. And you deserve it, right? Mmm. (CHUCKLES) Where is your Mr. Caldwell? Oh, he called. He's running late. Oh. Well, don't worry. He's coming with a checkbook. Yes, well, I don't have much time myself. Uh, let me show you. (CLINKS) Kennedy said the test-ban treaty was only a first step. First step to surrender. (SIGHS) You're a cynic. Lighter? If anyone's a cynic, it's Kennedy, Placating the left for '64. (CLICKS) Well, at least JFK has the right idea. And that is? Relaxation of tensions. Mutual disarmament? (LIGHTER CLICKS) (GLASS CLATTERS) A truce. (LIGHTER CLATTERS) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) What did you think of the flight? Takeoff was good... But the landing was better. (BOTH LAUGHING) You were right, you know? About what? Back when we were on the ground in Haiti... I felt like I was coming apart at the seams. (SIGHS) You were wonderful. (SIGHS) I didn't think we were gonna make it out of there. But we did. Well, you were right about rescuing the girl. I never would have forgiven myself. You don't need to say this. You saved us. (SIGHS) Yeah, but you saved me. Does this mean I earned my wings? Not yet. (FLY ME TO THE MOON PLAYING) * Fly me to the moon * And let me dream among the stars (BOTH LAUGHING) Do you remember that summer? Oh. Pfft. Block Island... (CHUCKLES) And your dad's crazy clambake? Oh, yeah. You used to wear that, um, uh, flowery headband. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. How do you remember that? Wow. You were right about the lobster. (CHUCKLES) * In other words (WHISPERING) I think I have order envy. (CHUCKLES) We can share. No. No, no, no. (CHUCKLES) I'll suffer through my bad decision. (CHUCKLES) If I can make it through that clambake, I... I can survive this. Well, if you do, I think you might deserve a reward. (CHUCKLES) Oh. Oh, yeah? What kind of reward? The kind that comes wrapped in a flowery headband. (CHUCKLES) Really? * In other words * Please be true * In other words * I love you * Oh Well, well, well. (SIGHS) Look what the cat dragged in. Captain Thornton. Oh. Dennis, okay? (CHUCKLES) So you and, uh, Vanderway, huh? Me and Vanderway what? Oh. You don't have to hide it. He told me all about you two. Oh, he did? I'd say you're pretty lucky. Not every fella talks that way about their girl. Really? Um... What did he say? That you were wonderful, smart, funny, kindhearted. He said that you were the best thing that's ever happened to him, and he didn't want to see you get into trouble. Ted said all that about me? Yep. Like I said, lucky girl. * In other words * Darlin', won't you kiss me? * In other words Oh, cookies. * I love you  You know, my flight back isn't for a few days. There's a lot we could do between now and then. Yeah, if I didn't have a date with a bunch of stuffy nuclear scientists. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I'd love to see you in action. Well, haven't you already? (CHUCKLES) Ooh! Come on. I want to see your speech. No. No, no. You don't... You don't want to do that. Oh, sure I do. Where is it? (SIGHS) Maggie, wait. Chris, you can't say all this. Well, I told you you weren't going to like it. You don't honestly believe all this? You're damn right, I do. Give... Come on. It's practically fascism! Now give me the speech. Mussolini was a childhood hero. Give me the... Give me the... What are you doing? Saving you from yourself. Maggie! (POUNDING ON DOOR) (LOCK CLICKS) Come on. Open the door. Almost there. (CLICKS) Is that smoke? Maggie, that speech is government property. Not anymore. (CLATTERS) This is the right thing to do, Chris. Believe me. In a couple of years, you will thank me for it. Yeah? Well, I don't need those pages. I have a photographic memory. It's all up here. (FLAMES CRACKLING) (GASPS) Oh, my God! Yeah, I know. It's a real gift. Oh, my God. It's lovely. (FIRE ALARM SOUNDING) BOLGER: Uh, we'll have to go back to the shop. We'll have Mr. Caldwell meet us there to pay for the bracelet. The shop? No, wait. Uh, he's going to be here any minute. You do hear the fire alarm, don't you? Uh, it's probably a false alarm. It happens here all the time. Nevertheless, I'm going to need that bracelet back. Hold on. You can't expect me to leave it with you. It's my bracelet! Not until it's been paid for! I... I... No. Please. No, please. Mr. Bolger, wait. What? No. Uh... No. Please, Mr. Bolger! (GASPS) Oh. Mr. Bolger, please wait! (FIRE ALARM CONTINUES SOUNDING) (CROWD MURMURING) Ted! I am so sorry. Laura. What... What happened to you downstairs? Um, nothing. I... I didn't even make it to the table, and both of you were gone. Teddy, what's going on? Um, I...it, uh, it's a fire alarm, I think. Um, we should... we should get downstairs. Mmm. Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. (PANTING) Kate? Oh. (PANTING) Maggie. Maggie, wait. Chris, can we just forget this ever happened? I can't do that. Why not? Because you are, without a doubt, the most reckless, pigheaded, craziest person I've ever met. I'm sorry. Don't apologize. I, uh, I kinda like it.
