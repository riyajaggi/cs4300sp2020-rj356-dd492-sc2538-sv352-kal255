 Pan Am (2011â€“2012): Season 1, Episode 8 - Unscheduled Departure - full transcript 
 As the crew flies to Caracas, a dashing, wealthy passenger, Miguel, charms the stewardesses with invitations to his yacht. Meanwhile another passenger, Henry Belson, suffers a heart attack, but there is no doctor on board to help out. The only hope of saving his life is to land in nearby Haiti to seek medical help. However, Haiti is a hotbed of local political unrest, reeling from tropical storms which downed trees and affected power - including the lights on the damaged runway. Colette and Ted team up to to make the dangerous trek for medical help.

 NARRATOR: Previously on Pan Am... Let's keep it in New York, Ginny. Monte Carlo was a lark. It's likely to be a long trip. I'm doing what I must. Good-bye, Kate. How old were you when the Nazis occupied France? I was three. I'm flying. I am in charge in the air, and what I say and what I do is the law. And a sky god is born!

 Hey, call it whatever you want. You either accept it or you need to get another jet. That hurricane's stepping on everything heading south. It hasn't stepped on us yet. Well... (CHUCKLES) Well. Hello. Hello. Laura, this is Charles Moore. He's gonna be navigating us down to Venezuela today. CHARLES: My friends call me Chuck. I'll let you know when you can call me Chuck. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Okay. (CHUCKLES) What happened to Sanjeev? Vacation. Bombay. There's an oxymoron. (CHUCKLES)

 Excuse me. Colette! Put your eyes back in their sockets. She's a waste of your time. CHUCK: Valuables under lock and key? She's waiting for Mr. Right. She's very patient. Hey, Bob, do you have the latest weather maps? Yeah. Thank you. Are we in for some bad weather? Well, it's October. 'Tis the season. Well, if you need any help in the cockpit, I do have experience. Yeah, so one lesson. Now you're the expert? Experts don't appreciate it as much as amateurs. It loses its thrill. Big storm brewing between us and Caracas. Massive even. Have they given this one a name yet? We should probably discuss this later. Depends on the weather. Uh, I'm forgetting my meteorology, but what is the technical term for a destructive squall with wind speeds exceeding 73 miles per hour? It's not a tropical storm but a... (CHUCKLES) (CLICKING TONGUE) Hurricane! That's what. Well, they must have named it something. Uh, it's Ginny. Hurricane Ginny! (CHUCKLES) Oh! What are the odds? What? TED: Why do they give hurricanes names anyway? And a girl's name. I mean, some poor sap somewhere must have really gotten burnt. And of all the female names that start with a "G", Georgia, uh, Geraldine, Gina. And we're flying right into it. Have you checked the returns on the radar? Oh. Recommend we change heading to 10 miles right of track. Mmm. Five should do it. You're ignoring the cosmic signals here. It's like the universe is giving you a second chance to avoid Ginny, and you're still not taking it. Where do I get her number? God. See, I wish I had an ejector seat. Hurricane Gerda. 1961 was Gerda. Right. Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to experience some rough weather. I'm gonna ask you to keep your seat belts fastened. (PLANE RATTLES) Here comes Ginny. I wonder which one will be more destructive. (LAUGHS) Landing card. Thank you. Landing card. MAN: Thank you so much. Sorry it's such a full flight, Miguel. We won't have a chance to catch up. A situation which must be remedied. I'm having a small gathering on my boat in the gulf tomorrow evening. Will you and your girlfriends still be on layover? Absolutely. Then it's a date. (WHISPERS) He keeps his boat out at night? Sweetie, when Miguel says "boat," he's referring to his 80-foot yacht, and a "small gathering" is a hundred of his most glamorous friends. Good evening, Mr. Belson. How can I help you? I was hoping I'd get the pretty one. Must be my lucky day. (CHUCKLES) Are you a diplomat or a playboy, Mr. Belson? (CHUCKLES) Please. Call me Henry. Oh, well, only if you call me Kate. (PLANE RATTLING) Is this normal, Kate? I mean, you know, feeling like you're in a washing machine? (CHUCKLES) It's as normal as snow at Christmas. The air we're flying through just changed directions, that's all. (COUGHING) Let me get you some water. No. Oh, no. All this shaking. You know, I might take my second bath today. Is this your first time flying, Henry? Yeah. This trip was 40 years in the making. (SNIFFS) Lot of mason jars filled up with spare change in that time. Well, as a seasoned traveler, let me give you my cure for turbulence. Staying home? Distraction. Uh, well, I knew this was my lucky day. You got a fellow? Oh, not anymore. Oh. A beautiful redhead broke my heart once, too. (WHISPERS) Henry, I wasn't the heartbreaker. (WHISPERS) Oh, that's hard to believe. I guess grief is the price we pay for love, huh? See that? A quick conversation, and the worst is over. Well, we're still 30,000 feet above the earth. (CHUCKLES) What brings you all the way up here after 40 years? (STUTTERS) Henry? (GRUNTING) Oh. Henry, what's wrong? (STIFLED) I can't breathe. Uh, has this happened before? Never. (GRUNTS) Oh! Henry. Fuel at 19 North will be 48,000 pounds. I've got a heart attack. You look okay to me. Maggie's checking for a doctor, but he needs a hospital. Well, it can't be Miami. The hurricane just hit the Florida coast. Find somewhere! If we don't land now, this man is going to die! Where is the nearest airport? (SIGHS) Are we really doing this? He needs a doctor. Grab the NoTAMs. Port-au-Prince is the closest. The Dominican republic is friendlier. No, the runway's still ripped up from the last hurricane. Haiti's clear. You realize voodoo is an acceptable form of medicine there. Port-au-Prince Tower, Clipper 203. I think you need to elevate his legs. That's for back pain. We appreciate your concern, but we need to keep this area clear, so if you could please return to your seats? I found the flight service manual. Oh, that's useless. "Treatment is absolute rest. "Make comfortable. If breathing is difficult, prop up pillows." That's it? That's all they expect us to do? Told you. Useless. Thank you. Oh. You're gonna be all right, Henry. The captain is working on how to get you more help. Why aren't they answering? We should be in range by now. Nature's way of telling you you're making a mistake. Port-au-Prince Tower, Clipper 203 is a Boeing 707. Requesting to make an unscheduled landing for a medical emergency. (MAN SPEAKING FRENCH OVER RADIO) What the hell is that? Are you on the right channel? Port-au-Prince Tower, Clipper 203. Do you read me? (MAN SPEAKING FRENCH) Why is he speaking French? Miss, a refill? We're not serving drinks, sir. Sorry. I had a minor collision. Well, we, uh, we have to land in Port-au-Prince, but they're only responding in French. Don't the air traffic controllers have to speak English? Yeah. Here. Talk to 'em. I want you to tell the Port-au-Prince tower we have a passenger onboard that will die if we don't get him on the ground. (SPEAKING FRENCH) You're letting a stewardess talk to the Control Tower? Do you speak French? (CONTROLLER REPLIES IN FRENCH) What are you looking for? A plan B. The Haitians kicked out the American military in July. I laid eyes on the poor bastard. He doesn't have time for plan A. Shh. (CONTROLLER SPEAKING FRENCH) Here. (CONTROLLER SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) What is it? The airport is closed. There is no one in the tower to help you land. We don't need anyone. No air traffic controller? Shouldn't we be aborting this landing? Tell him that we're starting our descent. Request visual for runway 10. (SPEAKING FRENCH) We're doing a visual? If you can't handle it, then tell me now. Chuck can handle it. Can't you, Chuck? Ladies and gentlemen, due to a medical emergency, we're going to make an unscheduled landing in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. We anticipate only a short stop. We'll be back on our way to Caracas. Cabin crew, please prepare for landing. I'm sorry. I'm going to need that back. When do you think we'll be in Caracas? I have family meeting me at the airport. Everyone, please buckle in. Let me know if you need help. I'm sorry. All right. Descending to 3,000 feet. Still total darkness. Let's go ahead and get our lights on. It's gonna be like landing in a black hole. Still not helping, Chuck. We need runway lights. They haven't come on yet? No. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Let's go flaps 30, gear down before landing checks. Flaps at 30. Gear down. In Haiti, that could mean they're looking for flashlights. They're working on it. Is everyone strapped in back there? Kate's on top of it. Hold on. Descend to 1,000 feet. Descending to 1,000 feet. Colette, tell them we're landing now. If they don't want me to hit the tower, they can give me lights. (SPEAKING FRENCH) We may have to go around. We'll lose at least 20 minutes. Captain, you're out of limits. Descending to 500 feet. Stick with me, Henry. You can do it. We're almost there. 200 feet. Ah, is that the runway? (SPEAKING FRENCH) (BUZZER SOUNDING) Oh, the son of a bitch snuck up on us. We're coming in too fast. Runway in sight. Full flaps. Confirm runway in sight. Full flaps. Aircraft at 40 feet. 20 feet. 10 feet. (ENGINE POWERING DOWN) (SIGHS) (BOTH SIGHING) I've seen friendlier-looking ground crews. What if they try to board the plane? Well, then I'll take the one on the right. (COUGHING) Do you want some water, Henry? Henry? Water? No. (EXHALES DEEPLY) There's nothing to see. Just relax. We'll be taking off soon. Where's the doctor? (SPEAKING FRENCH) What's he saying? There's no phone, no doctor. (SPEAKING FRENCH) There's a village not too far with a doctor. We can bring Mr. Belson there. I don't think he can travel. We'll have to bring the doctor to him. I'll go. No, no. A captain can't. You must stay with your plane. (SPEAKING FRENCH) No. No jeep. Killing. Give me all the money you have. Did he just say "killing"? One of us is gonna have to go. It must be me. The doctor might only speak French. I might need directions. No. No, no, no. Colette, you don't have to do this. This is why we landed, isn't it? Quickly. All right. Ted, you drive. That's what you're worried about, my driving? He's driven in Haiti before. Been driven. In a taxi. Ted! You don't stop for anything. Sound advice, Captain. (ENGINE STARTS) I used to like coming to Haiti. Loved Lake Sumatra. See the flamingos and the man-eating crocodiles, but I tell you, you put one lunatic in charge, and the whole country turns into crazyland. Instead of leaving, the American military should have crushed Papa Doc and his merry men and taken over. The whole country would be better off. We'd be feeding flamingos right now. That probably sounds a little imperialistic to the French, right? You all right? Do you always talk this much? Yeah, when I'm nervous. A bit. (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) You always talk this little? What's that? What? It looks familiar. A hurricane just hit. I'm sure there's more than one downed tree. We are going in circles. Not according to the North Star, which is directly behind us. I used to be a navigator, you know? Flamingos bite. They do. I mean, they're very pretty and pink and very quiet, but they bite. They break the flesh. You know, as a child, when there was danger, I was taught not to speak, not to make a sound. Really? Why? Ted! Whoa! Are they dead? There's nothing we can do for them. Just keep driving. Wait! Americains? (SPEAKING FRENCH) What did she say, and why is she getting in? She will show us the way. Lucille Ball? Oh. I thought you were gonna say Rita Hayworth. Oh, well, I like funny. But with nice legs. I bet you had your choice. Oh, but there's always that one, right? That one you let in all the way ends up breaking your heart. Well, she didn't mean to. Yeah, she fought hard, but the cancer won, and she left. Blanca, my redhead. The redhead who broke your heart was your wife? Married 40 years. Going to Venezuela to celebrate. That's where she was born. (CHUCKLES) We always meant to go together one day, but, you know, things... Things. Blanca? Yeah. It's a funny name for a redhead, isn't it? (LAUGHS) Oh, it's beautiful. (COUGHS) It was not just on the outside. You know, she cared about people. She was always volunteering for things. Too much, I thought. I wanted her with me, you know? Selfish. Very selfish. I'm gonna make up for that when I get back. Try to be more like her, make some kind of impact. Mmm. I've been trying to make an impact myself. Keep trying. (BOTH CHUCKLING) COLETTE: She says the killings have been going on for weeks now. The secret police suspect everyone to be a rebel. The rebels suspect everyone of working for the dictator Papa Doc. And here we are, two foreigners in a government vehicle. Swell. Perhaps they'll be too busy shooting at each other to bother with us. What about our planeload of passengers? (SPEAKS FRENCH) Does it look like I can go anywhere? It's just a few miles. We'll bring you right back. And how many die here before I get back? We got money. Back at the plane. Enough to save a lot of lives. What makes your passenger more important than these people? (SPEAKING FRENCH) Nitroglycerin. Put it under his tongue. It can sometimes stop the attack. Now go before anyone sees you here. (THANKS IN FRENCH) No, no, no, no. Ride's over. Tell her to get out. No. I can't. Why? I already told her she could come with us. No. No way. Not unless she's got a medical degree. Her entire family was butchered. (GUNSHOTS FIRING) Ted! TED: These gunshots are coming from the north. We have to go north. Lay down! In the back. Don't get up, no matter what. You, too. We might be driving right through the middle of it. You're counting. Why are you counting? The runway. It's too short? That stays out here. How could it be too short? Pan Am used to land here all the time. Hurricane left some scars. How much is gone? Too much for a loaded 707. So we can't take off? Maybe the cavalry's on their way. Oh, if they're the cavalry, we're the Indians. (CHUCKLES) How short is it? About 500 feet shy of liftoff. So we're grounded. You think "grounded's" a viable option? According to that manual, it's the only option. These manuals are written by engineers, not pilots. These planes will do a lot more than they say they can. They build in a pad for a reason. Well, we can't afford that reason. What's the outside temperature? 78 degrees. Gotta love the tropics. But the wind speed is 12 knots at our tail, which negates the temperature advantage. I mentioned I was a pilot, right? Current fuel level and cargo, we weigh in at 237,000 pounds. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Gonna have to lose some weight. Starting in 6A. 185, 140, 133. Why are you asking our weights? The plane is too heavy to take off. I just saw the pilot measuring the runway. Now they're concerned about weight? How long have you been flying 707s? How long has your captain? He looks like he just got out of the service. He does look very young. LAURA: Youngest captain at Pan Am. Well, he is. So ask yourselves, why would Pan Am, the best airline in the world, promote someone so young? Well, looking around, I can only assume it's because he looks good in his uniform. (WOMEN GASPING) May we help you? (SPEAKING FRENCH) (REPLIES IN FRENCH) They're just hungry. They want some food. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (SIGHS) How did Hemingway describe fear, Mr. Ortiz? Was it "Grace under pressure"? Oh, no. I'm sorry. That's how he described courage. So while she takes care of the men with the guns, why don't you sit down, and I'll make you a nice, hot cup of tea. Where are they? I don't know. Henry? You awake? Oh. Still here. What, uh... What part of Venezuela is Blanca from? Oh. Chuao. Very small. By the water. She said everybody there just wanted to feed you. I've been to Venezuela several times, but never there. I'd love to see it with you, Henry. You may have to carry me. Oh, come on. We'll celebrate your anniversary together. We'll dance the joropo. (SIGHS) You're very lucky to have gone to so many places. (SIGHS) Thirty-five countries and counting. (GRUNTS) Best part of my job. (SIGHS) Which was your favorite? (WHISPERS) Croatia. Ah. Yugoslavia. It was just supposed to be a short layover. It was part of my job. I didn't even want to go there, but... From the moment I arrived I felt like I was home. Was it... Was it beautiful? (CHUCKLES) It was gorgeous. Rugged but not rough. Strong, safe... With this romantic side that surprised me. (SIGHS) It devastated me. Who was he? (SIGHS) He was my redhead. Henry? (SPEAKING FRENCH) LAURA: Where's the doctor? You're looking at 'em. He's not coming? He sent medicine. (SIGHS) Dean. No. Absolutely not. Dean, we can't. We can't leave her here. She barely escaped with her life. And I'm sympathetic to that, Colette, I am, but taking her is not an option. Are you hearing me? She could be killed. Yeah, along with a thousand other villagers. So let's go out, we'll round them up, we'll lock the doors, and wait for someone to take us hostage. I'm not asking for thousands of villagers. I'm asking for one girl. And I'm asking you to put yourself in my shoes. I just landed a plane full of passengers who are my responsibility on a runway that is too short in a country that's about to explode. And between you and me? The only way that we are taking off is if we lose a few thousand pounds and there's a passenger on this plane that's got a guardian angel that feels like doing extra credit. She doesn't weigh much. Oh, damn it, Colette. I don't have the time, the space, or the luxury to take on strays right now. "Strays"? That's how you see orphans? Oh, don't do that. Don't make this about you. How is she... What is she? She 17? I didn't realize there was an expiration date. Even if we take her, immigration will immediately kick her right back. We have to try. Pan Am has strict guidelines against bringing stowaways on board. I'm the Captain of this aircraft. I believe in you, I believe this plane will take off, and I believe that once we're safely in the air, you will regret leaving that girl behind. (SNIFFLES) I landed here for nothing, put all these people's lives in danger for a dead man. You landed here to save a life. There is still the possibility of that. She's standing right there. WOMAN: The man is dead. Why are we still here? We'll be leaving very soon. What are we doing now? Refugees? She doesn't belong on this plane. She's seen much worse. Is she coming with us? She lost all her family. Nothing's left for her here. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Here. You may need this. It gets cold up there. (SPEAKING FRENCH) TED: Whos' this guy? You don't suppose he could be delivering good news, do you? The good humor man's coming? Or the rebels. Any one of 'em would love a planeload of American hostages to parade around like poodles. So that hurricane should have cleared Miami by now. Yeah? It's closer. We can lighten the load by burning more fuel. We're diverting. How overweight are we? You know how ostriches are birds but they can't fly? Well, this one's going to. I want you to start the before start checklist, then start the engines. (SIGHS) Copy that. (CHUCKLES) Why is she being given a seat? Well, she's the only Haitian passenger that was brave enough to show up. First you land us in this hellhole just to watch a man die, and now you want to smuggle refugees? We choose who flies on this aircraft. What if you were sick? Wouldn't you want us to land for you? I don't deal with conjecture. I deal in facts. And the fact is she is a stowaway. She is a guest of Pan Am. And you are an ignorant young girl. Go back to your seat and shut up. Who is the paying passenger here? If you promise to go mute for the rest of this trip, I will see about getting you a refund. DEAN: (OVER PA) Okay, everybody calm down. (ENGINES WHIRRING) You hear that? So those are our engines. We're burning off some fuel so we can lighten our load, and then we'll be leaving. But I need everybody's help. Do you want us to get out and push? (ALL LAUGHING) I may take you up on that, but right now I'm gonna need all your personal items removed from the plane. That includes your luggage. Every pound counts. We burn 50 pounds a minute with all four engines running. Yeah, we need a lot more minutes and we don't have 'em. You want me to change the laws of physics? Oh! Hey! Stop! Don't take another step. I paid to have my luggage arrive with me in Venezuela, and that's where it's going. Let me help you with that. You idiot. Ah, hey. You touch that suitcase, you're gonna be keeping it company on the tarmac when we take off. You and Papa Doc can have a party without us. When I report this, you'll be lucky to fly crop dusters. Nothing wrong with crop dusters. That's how I learned to fly. Go. Thank you for flying Pan Am. MIGUEL: If this plane is too heavy for luggage, it is too heavy for that Haitian. WOMAN: He's right. COLETTE: This isn't luggage. She's a person who needs our help. This redhead needs a favor. WOMAN: We need to leave her here. COLETTE: If she stays here she'll be killed. WOMAN: We might die if she doesn't. If the girl stays, somebody goes. Are you volunteering? No. Henry is. He wanted to help people. Tonight he gets to do that. We leave the body, and the girl stays. You made that impact, Henry. Safe travels. TED: That can't be good. Ready or not, we're leaving right now. I'll start preflight. DEAN: Kate! Let's go! Prepare for takeoff! Come on, let's go. The wind has increased on our tail and the temperature has dropped. We can't take off. Cut the pep talk, Chuck. How's our fuel? We've lost 6,000 pounds. Add that to our garage sale, and we're down to about 200,000 pounds. Still not enough to fit into our prom dress. We need to burn more fuel, a lot more. Well, there's no time. Setting brakes. Setting takeoff thrust. Takeoff thrust set. Captain, it's my duty to tell you that based on FAA rules and regulations, it is too dangerous to take off. Yeah, noted. We've taken off from aircraft carriers shorter than this. In a fighter jet. A 707 isn't designed to take off like this. 'Cause fighter jets don't have four engines. If you don't blow an engine first. You need me to change your diaper, Chuck? I mean, you're embarrassing the Navy here. Ted, I'm just trying to tell you... It's not Ted, it's First Officer Vanderway, and sitting next to me is Captain Lowrey. He makes the decisions on this aircraft without any interference from you. Am I understood? Yes, sir. Seats in the upright position. Make sure your belts are nice and tight. Flaps 20. Flaps 20. Engine 2, oil pressure 80. Engine 3, 82. We can't sustain this thrust forever. Just another minute. Smell that? That's the brakes burning up. I can fly without brakes. Just a little while longer. Another 30 seconds, they're gonna be on our tail. Thank you for Henry. I hope immigration doesn't send her back. DEAN: Cabin crew prepare for immediate takeoff. I may have a friend who can help. It's now or never. Do it. Releasing brakes. Pull up. Pull up! I see it. Damaged runway cleared. Take gear up. Oh, way ahead of you. Flaps up. Flaps up. (EXHALES DEEPLY) (SIGHS DEEPLY) Nice job, Captain. (SIGHS) We may have to land again. I think I'm having a heart attack. Your controls. Ladies and gentlemen, that was rougher than expected. My apologies. But we are climbing normally and we'll be reaching cruising altitude shortly. WOMAN: Yeah! MAN: Whoo! COLETTE: Don't worry. Kate is going to help you. MAN: Miss Valois. Please give us a few more minutes. Please. I need you to do this, Richard. I can always count on you for the unorthodox. Can you do it or not? We do have some experience with green cards. (SIGHS) Please, I understand, but we might be able to fix this. I'm in no mood for one of your little games. Just do it. Give me a couple of hours. No. Not hours. Minutes. I guess I will have to go over a few heads. And a foster family. A nice one. She can't be here alone. I will interrogate them myself. Thank you, Richard. I owed you one. Or several. Yes. Goodbye. You land in a hostile country, you leave the dead body of a Pan Am passenger, and you come back with a 17-year-old refugee. Which one of you is responsible for bringing a stowaway on board a Pan Am aircraft? Miss... Valois. Miss Valois, come with me. Colette, I can't let you take the blame for this. I brought the girl on board. Is this true? They're both covering for me. Ask anyone in our New York office. I'm the troublemaker. Maggie, you are such a liar. It was my idea, and you know it. Laura, stop protecting me. You know this was my idea. They're all lying. I already confessed. Okay. I think I get the picture. Thank you, ladies. There you are, girls. Power in numbers. KATE: Debriefing. I'm buying. So how long are we stranded here for? Stranded? Have you been to Palm Beach? Colette? Are you coming? Right behind you. Okay. Just consider yourself fortunate that Mr. Trippe seems to hold you in such high regard. Quite an evening. Really? Did I miss something? Some bad weather.
