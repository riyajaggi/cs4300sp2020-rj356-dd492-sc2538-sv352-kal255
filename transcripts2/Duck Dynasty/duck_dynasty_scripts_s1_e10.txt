I THINK IT'S ON MY SKIN. UH-OH, HERE WE GO. HEY, THAT'S ROOF'S HOT. MARTIN, WHAT IS YOUR PLAN? I'M GONNA COME OUT THERE AND GET Y'ALL. I'M GONNA HELP Y'ALL DOWN. YOU GOTTA HURRY UP. GODWIN, THE SKUNK! GO! OH, MY GOODNESS! THE SKUNK! DON'T LEAVE US! NOW HOW AM I GONNA GET DOWN? WELL... THAT WAS A TOTAL DISASTER. I'LL ADMIT THE SHOP-VAC IDEA WAS NOT THAT SUCCESSFUL. I NEED SOME KIND OF LOTION, AND I NEED A PAIR OF TWEEZERS. BUT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO OBTAIN SOMETHING AS GOOD AS WILD HONEY, YOU DO NOT CONSIDER THE DANGERS. THAT'S FOR WHAT WE CALL HIGH-TOPPERS. YAHOOS. CITY FOLK. WELL, THERE'S TWO TYPE OF PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD. EDUCATED AND "UNDUCATED." UNDUCATED? LOOK HERE, LOOK HERE. ONE OF THEM HAS GOT A LEGITIMATE EXCUSE. YEAH. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU'RE EDUCATED, OKAY, AND YOU'RE STILL AN IDIOT! PLAIN STUPID. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, MM-HMM. Y'ALL, THAT WAS THE DUMBEST IDEA I'VE EVER HEARD! OKAY, AND I'VE GOT A LEGITIMATE EXCUSE. WELL, WHAT'S MY EXCUSE? HEY, YOU'RE JUST AN IDIOT TOTALLY. OKAY, YOU'RE BOTH IDIOTS. AND I'M GETTING HUNGRY. OH, MY GOODNESS. DEPUTY TOLBURN.

I GOT SPRAYED BY A SKUNK. YEAH, YOU DID. HEY, I WAS FIXING TO GET THAT SUCKER. WITH THAT? YEAH, I WAS GONNA TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS WITH IT. HELLO? DID YOU TRY THE EMERGENCY SWITCH? NO. ALL THESE SCISSOR LIFTS HAVE AN EMERGENCY SWITCH ON THEM. OH! OH, MY GOODNESS! WE'RE GOING DOWN! YAY! COULD THEY HAVE DONE THAT ALL ALONG? GODWIN, YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SWITCH? I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. WHY DID GODWIN AND MARTIN NOT DO THAT HOURS AGO? THANK YOU. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. Y'ALL HAVE A GOOD DAY. THANK YOU, OFFICER. YOU THE MAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BOY, THAT WAS FUN. WE STILL DIDN'T GET THE DECOYS. WE WENT HOME, WE REGROUPED, AND I THINK WE HAVE A SOLID PLAN "B." I HEARD SOMEWHERE THAT BEES DON'T STING AT NIGHT. I ASSUME THEY'RE SLEEPING, KINDA LIKE SI ON THE JOB. ALL RIGHT, MARTIN, YOU GET THE LADDER. JASE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE LADDER. THE PLAN IS BULLETPROOF. CUT THE LIMB, IT FALLS IN THE BAG... BOOM! WILD HONEY AND BISCUITS FOR EVERYONE. I GOT THE GETAWAY VEHICLE READY. I'M GOING TO LET THEM GET OUT THERE AND DO IT, AND I'M GOING TO WATCH THE SHOW. THAT THING GOT ANY BEES ON IT? IS THE SKY BLUE? I GUESS, I CAN'T SEE THE SKY RIGHT NOW. HEY, I'M BEHIND Y'ALL ALL THE WAY. I BET YOU ARE. HE WAS OVER THERE LIKE A SCARED LITTLE BOY IN A FETAL POSITION OVER SOME BEES. HE'S LOST HIS MANHOOD. HEY, THAT'S HOW I ROLL. STARTING TO MAKE A LITTLE RACKET NOW. YEAH. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS. HEY, ONE JUST FLEW OFF. OH, DID IT? HEY, THEY'RE MOVING. OH! OKAY. OH! OW! NOT AGAIN! DOES THIS FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF "STUPID HUMAN TRICKS"? HEY, THEY DON'T STING AT NIGHT. I READ SOMEWHERE THAT BEES DON'T STING AT NIGHT. IT SEEMS RIDICULOUS, BUT COME TO THINK OF IT, NONE OF US HAVE EVER BEEN STUNG AT NIGHT, SO WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT. HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW WILLIE COULD MOVE THAT FAST. AAH! GET THEM OFF! OH! BUT HEY, EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER. Y'ALL GET THE HIVE IN THE BAG? HECK NO! DID YOU SEE THEM SUCKERS COME OUT OF THERE? THEY GOT ME TWICE. I WANT THIS HONEY SO BAD, I CAN TASTE IT. BUT IN THE END, BUTTER'S NOT SO BAD. MISSION ABORTED. HEY, GUYS. ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THE STORY? OH, WE GOT A STORY. COMING HOME WITH OUR TAILS TORN UP, IT'S EMBARRASSING. WE GOT ONE LAST RESORT, AND THAT'S PHIL ROBERTSON. FOUND SOMETHING OF INTEREST ON YOUR PROPERTY. HUH? IT'S TIME TO SWALLOW OUR PRIDE. LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH. THERE'S A BIG OL' HONEY BEEHIVE. FULL OF HONEY. FULL OF HONEY. SO WHERE IS THE HONEY? IT'S STILL IN THE HIVE. THAT THING'S IMPENETRABLE. WE ALL GO IN, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN... BOOM, POW, BOOM! YEAH, POP, POP, POP, POP. IT GETS HOSTILE. HEY, I TOLD Y'ALL ABOUT THIS NIGHT OPERATION. SI! WAIT A MINUTE. Y'ALL WENT OVER THERE, GOT YOUR TAIL TORE UP, AND CAME BACK EMPTY-HANDED. I GOT STUNG IN THE NECK. SINCE THEY DIDN'T THINK IT NECESSARY TO ASK FOR ADVICE FROM OLD DAD, THEY PRETTY WELL GOT THEIR TAIL TORE OFF. REAL FUNNY. WHOO. THE OLD BILL CLINTON LINE "I FEEL YOUR PAIN"... I ENJOYED THEIR PAIN. WELL, NEVER SEND BOYS TO DO A MAN'S JOB. OH, HERE WE GO. I'LL GO DOWN THERE AND GET THE HONEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. HA! WE'LL SEE HOW HE DOES. HE WON'T BE LAUGHING AFTER HE MESSES WITH THEM BEES. THEY'RE EVIL. CASE CLOSED. COLE-MAN, THIS IS WHAT ALL THE FUSS HAS BEEN ABOUT. WILLIE-BOY AND JASE... SOMETIMES THEY ACT BEFORE THEY THINK IT THROUGH AS THEY SAY. THE REASON I CHOSE COLE-MAN TO GO... IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE IN SHOWING THESE BOYS HOW IT'S DONE. BEES ARE KINDA LIKE WOMEN, SO WE'RE GONNA BE REAL EASY HERE. WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BEES, DOGS, OR WOMEN... PAIN CAN COME UP ON YOU QUICKLY FROM EITHER ONE OF THEM. YOU GOTTA HANDLE THEM REAL, REAL EASY, COLE-MAN... BOTH OF THEM. YOU START SEEING BEES. WOMEN THE SAME WAY. THE IDEA IS TO... GET A LITTLE SMOKE IN THERE TO CALM THEM ALL DOWN. JUST KEEP A LITTLE SMOKE GOING ON THERE LIKE THAT. THERE YOU ARE. SEE, DID YOU GET STUNG? NOPE. ME EITHER. IT'S THE HARD HEADS AND THE FAST MOVERS... THEY LEAVE EMPTY-HANDED, AND ME AND YOU LEAVE WITH THE HONEY. OLDER HEADS PREVAIL, AND IN THE END, PEACE OF MIND WILL COME YOUR WAY. IN THIS CASE, SWEET HONEY FROM THE BEES AND A LONG-STANDING, GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR WOMAN IN THE FUTURE. COLE-MAN, WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS HONEY TO MISS KAY. SHE'S GONNA BE HAPPY-HAPPY! YOUR GRANDMA'S GONNA LOVE YOU TO DEATH, MAN. WHERE ARE THE GUYS? I WOULD'VE PROBABLY WORN DIFFERENT SHOES IF I KNEW I WAS GONNA LOAD. THERE THEY ARE. WHERE HAVE Y'ALL BEEN? HUH? YEAH, YOU'RE LOADING THE REST OF THESE, THEY'RE HEAVY. ALL RIGHT, SO WHERE ARE THE DECOYS? WHAT DECOYS? DO NOT TELL ME THEY'RE STILL ON THE ROOF. KORIE'S LIKE ALL THE ROBERTSON WOMEN. WHEN THEY LOCKED IN ON SOMETHING, THEY AIN'T GETTING OFF OF IT. I NEED THE DECOYS. YOU'RE OUT THERE TRYING TO GET HONEY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. I NEED THIS FOR THE CHURCH FESTIVAL. THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. THIS IS NOT A ROCKET SCIENCE PROJECT. YOU'RE THE IDIOT WHO COULDN'T GET UP THERE AND GET THEM ON THE SCISSOR LIFT. YOU'RE THE IDIOT THAT THOUGHT BEES DON'T STING AT NIGHT. AND LOOK AT YOU. I'M IN PAIN. I JUST GOT DOUGH-POPPED BY A THOUSAND BEES ON THE BACK OF MY HEAD. JUST GET THE DECOYS. ADMIT YOU'RE STUPID. THOSE BEE STINGS WENT TO YOUR BRAIN. LET ME SHOW YOU HOW HARD IT IS TO GET THESE DOWN. ALL RIGHT, GO GET THEM. SO HERE I AM, GETTING DRAGGED INTO ANOTHER ONE. "WILLIE, YOU GOTTA HELP ME." I'M GOING TO DO IT. ALL RIGHT, I AIN'T GETTING UP THERE, BOY. I'M SCARED OF HEIGHTS. THROW THE DECOYS DOWN. WATCH OUT. OH! MY WORD! TOUGH JOB. JASE, WE NEED THEM INTACT. OH, WE SHOULD PUSH THEM DOWN. PUSH THE LITTLE THING. REMEMBER THAT EMERGENCY THING? OKAY, I'M DOING IT. THE DECOYS STARTED GETTING LIGHTER AND LIGHTER. COME ON, GUYS! HEY, HEY! HURRY UP! SI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I AIN'T DOING NOTHING! "WH-WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" SI! THE STUPID THING'S RUNNING BY ITSELF. WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE WE'RE DOING? WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU A LITTLE TASTE OF YOUR OWN MEDICINE, JACK. OH, THAT'S REAL FUNNY. REAL FUNNY. THANKS FOR THE DECOYS. YEAH. SERVES Y'ALL RIGHT FOR LAUGHING AT US. THAT'S RIGHT. THIS IS EMBARRASSING THAT YOU'RE WITH THE WOMEN. I SPENT 24 1/2 YEARS IN THE MILITARY. ANYTIME THERE'S A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO BEARDED MEN AND TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, SI IS ALWAYS GONNA GO WITH THE TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. BOYS, IN VIETNAM, WE CALL THAT A SUCCESSFUL AMBUSH. THAT'S RIGHT. LOOK HERE, THIS IS LOSERS WEEPERS, FINDERS KEEPERS. SOMEBODY'S GOTTA WIN. IT MIGHT AS WELL BE ME. APOLOGIZE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY, "I'M SORRY." SAY "I'M SORRY." I'M NOT APOLOGIZING FOR YOU BEING STUPID. WELL, HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET DOWN? OH, I CAN GET DOWN. THERE'S A FIVE-LETTER WORD THAT MAKES PEOPLE START DOING ALL KIND OF CRAZY THINGS. MONEY. $100 RIGHT HERE. NAH! UNBELIEVABLE. $100 GOING ONCE. NO! COME ON, $100! $100 GOING TWICE. MM-HMM. YEAH, RIGHT. DROP IT. HERE WE GO. JESSIE, ARE YOU SERIOUSLY GONNA DO IT? HEY, IT'S $100. MONEY TALKS, SON, MONEY TALKS. SEE WHAT WORKS? Y'ALL ARE RIDICULOUS. ALL ABOARD, BOYS. I'M GETTING OFF CHEAP. I'D GO UP TO $1,000 TO NOT SAY I'M SORRY. ALL WOMEN LOVE MONEY. WORKS EVERY TIME. YOU'RE IN A BAD POSITION, WILLIE. YOU BETTER RECOGNIZE. FREEDOM! I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT WHAT WERE YOU DOING UP ON THE ROOF? IT'S A LONG STORY. YEAH. WHAT HAVE Y'ALL BEEN UP TO? "BEEHIVING." OH, NO. COLE-MAN, SHOW THEM WHAT YOU GOT. I THOUGHT THAT WAS OVER. Y'ALL ALL TORE OFF... WHAT IN THE WORLD... OH, MY GOD. THEY GOT THE HONEY. COLE! THESE BOYS COULDN'T PULL IT OFF. HOW DID Y'ALL DO IT? SEE, THE TRICK IS, YOU GOTTA TREAT THEM EXACTLY LIKE YOU TREAT WOMEN. YOU HAVE TO BLOW JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SMOKE, DON'T YOU, COLE? COLE-MAN, HE SAID, "HEY, YOU GOTTA TREAT THEM LIKE YOU WOULD WOMEN... WITH A LITTLE SMOKE." HE'S LEARNING. YOU DIDN'T GET STUNG ANY? NOPE. IT'S PROBABLY 'CAUSE WE LOOSENED THEM ALL UP FOR YOU. NO, IT'S 'CAUSE THEY STUNG US, AND THEY ALL DIED. THAT'S WHY THESE BOYS ALL GOT GOOD-LOOKING WIVES. BUNCH OF SMOKE-BLOWING CLOWNS. AT THE LITTLE FESTIVAL, THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS IN MISS KAY'S FAMOUS PECAN HONEY PIES. SO AFTER ALL OF THE RIGMAROLE, AGE ALWAYS WINS OUT. SHOWED THESE BOYS WHAT THEY COULDN'T DO. ME AND THE LITTLE GRANDSON PULLED IT OFF. ALL RIGHT, LET'S LOAD THIS STUFF UP. Y'ALL GET THE DECOYS. JASE, LET'S GET THE BOOTH. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA LET Y'ALL GET THE BOOTH THIS TIME. WE'LL GET THE BOOTH. DON'T DROP IT. YEAH, I'LL GET THAT. ARE THESE CURTAINS GONNA BLOW OFF? PATIENCE HAS NEVER REALLY BEEN ONE OF MY STRENGTHS. AFTER TAKING ON AN ANGRY SWARM OF BEES TWICE, THIS HAS NEVER BEEN MORE APPARENT. WOW. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE? GOOD SHOT. A PECAN PIE. YOU SEE, THIS EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT ME A PRETTY SIMPLE LESSON. IF YOU ACT BEFORE THINKING THINGS THROUGH, YOU'RE FIXING TO GET STUNG. SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOTTA SLOW DOWN, TAKE A STEP BACK, AND GET SOME PERSPECTIVE. IT MAY TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME THAN YOU'D LIKE, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, SOME THINGS ARE WORTH WAITING FOR. HEY, YOU WANT TO KISS AN OLD GOAT? WHAT ABOUT IT, PRINCESS? NO?
