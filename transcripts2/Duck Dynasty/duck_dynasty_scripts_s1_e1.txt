 WELCOME, STUDENTS. I GOT TO SAY, THOUGH, MONEY DIDN'T CHANGE SOME THINGS. I DON'T LIKE MEAT FROM THE GROCERY STORE. IT MAKES ME NERVOUS. HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY. WE STILL MANAGE TO STAY TRUE TO OURSELVES. All: AMEN. All: AMEN. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn BRAD JUST CALLED. YEAH? WE SENT THEM 1,000 DUCK PICKERS. WHAT DID THEY ORDER? TRIPLE THREATS. JUST SEND THEM TRIPLE THREATS. THERE'S, LIKE, THREE IN THE BIN BACK THERE. EVERY DUCK CALL WE MAKE AT DUCK COMMANDER IS MADE BY HAND. THE CALLS ARE MADE BY MY BROTHER JASE, MY UNCLE SI, AND GODWIN. MY WIFE, KORIE, SHE HELPS ME RUN THE ENTIRE BUSINESS. HEY. IS ANYBODY BACK THERE? HELLO? WHERE'S EVERYBODY AT? YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE EVERYBODY'S AT? OKAY, LOOK, JOHN, CAN YOU COME BACK TO MY OFFICE, PLEASE? NO WONDER WE DON'T HAVE ANY DUCK CALLS. - EXTENSION 1-0-8-8... - EX... UNBELIEVABLE. THIS WHOLE COMPANY IS FALLING APART. HOLY COW. WHOO-HOO! WHOA, COME ON. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T BUY THESE CATFISH IN OPELOUSAS IN A RESTAURANT. OPELOUSAS CATFISH ONLY RUN TWO WEEKS OUT OF THE YEAR. SO, WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING, I'M RUNNING WITH THEM. LOOK, YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON BEING OUT HERE IN THE WATER... CATCHING THESE BIG OPELOUSAS CATFISH. WILLIE WANTS US UP IN THE WAREHOUSE. I GOT NEWS FOR WILLIE. I WON'T BE THERE... YEAH. NOT WHILE THIS IS GOING ON. BESIDES, SI IS NOT AT THE OFFICE EITHER. HE'S CLEARING BEAVER DAMS WITH PHIL UP THE RIVER. GAH! DID YOU GET HIM? I MISSED HIM. RIGHT WHEN YOU PULLED IT, HIS HEAD COME UP AND THEN HE WAS GONE. IF THERE'S ANYTHING OUT THERE THAT I DON'T LIKE... IT IS THE BEAVER. HE IS A GREAT DAM BUILDER, BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE A CLEAR THINKING ON "WHY I'M DOING WHAT I'M DOING." HE JUST DOES IT 24-7. HE NEVER STOPS, EVER. THE PROBLEM WITH THESE BEAVERS, SI, THEY'VE KILLED MILLIONS OF ACRES OF TIMBER. THEY LIKE THE VIETCONG. OH, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THEY ONLY MOVE AT NIGHT... AND THEY LIVE IN HOLES IN THE GROUND. AND THEY LIVE IN HOLES IN THE GROUND. YEP. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE ONLY GOOD BEAVER IS ONE WITH A BULLET IN HIS HEAD. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? YEAH. DID YOU GET HIM? NO. HEY, WHAT'S UP? WHY AREN'T WE MAKING DUCK CALLS? I'VE BEEN MAKING THEM ALL DAY. WE DON'T HAVE ANY. WE GOT THREE. WHY AREN'T YOU MAKING TRIPLE THREATS? WELL, I THOUGHT WE WAS MAKING DUCK PICKERS. NO, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKING TRIPLE THREATS IF WE HAVE THREE IN THE BIN, I'VE TOLD Y'ALL. WELL, LOOK, YOU'RE YELLING AT ME... I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE. FAMILY BUSINESS MEANS THE FAMILY DOES THE BUSINESS. AND RIGHT NOW GODWIN'S THE ONLY ONE WORKING. AND HE'S NOT EVEN PART OF THE FAMILY. I MEAN, WE JUST HAVE TO GET IT DONE. YEAH. WHY ARE YOU STILL SITTING THERE? HEY. HI, HI, HI. HEY, Y'ALL. WHOA, WILLIE, WILLIE, WILLIE. YOU WANT A PLATE, WILLIE? YEAH, SURE. WILLIE, WE'VE BEEN OUT KILLING BEAVERS, ME AND YOUR UNCLE. AND JASE IS LOADING THE BOAT DOWN WITH OPELOUSAS CAT, BIG FINE BLUES. EVERYBODY HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY. SO, WILL, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING? TRYING TO KEEP THIS MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR OPERATION TOGETHER. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE PAYING US MUCH FOR THOSE BEAVER PELTS ANYMORE. THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT... YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY NEEDS TO MAKE MONEY. WILLIE WENT OFF AND GOT EDUCATED. HE WEARS SUITS. I'VE NEVER BOUGHT A SUIT IN MY LIFE. HE'S A SUIT MAN NOW. THE LIFE OF A CEO. JASE, THAT'S WHAT YOUR BROTHER IS INTO. WHEN YOU HEAR "CEO," YOU THINK, "CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER." BUT WHEN I LOOK AT WILLIE, I THINK IF YOU SAW HIM WALKING DOWN THE ROAD, HE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR A CAN TO PUT A DOLLAR IN OR A SIGN SAYING, "THE END IS NEAR." WELL, HE'S TOO BUSY ALL THE TIME. I LIVE BY A CODE. IF YOU'RE TOO BUSY TO DUCK-HUNT OR CATCH FISH, YOU'RE TOO BUSY. YEAH, WELL, THAT CODE IS MESSING UP THE OPERATIONS AT THE OFFICE. JASE... HE HAS NO STRESS. HE BRAGS ABOUT BEING STRESS-FREE. I MEAN, I LIKE TO HUNT TOO. I WOULD LIKE TO HUNT EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR, BUT WE HAVE TO RUN A BUSINESS. IF WE DON'T, WE'RE GOING TO ALL HAVE TO GET REAL JOBS, AND NONE OF US WILL GET TO HUNT. SEE, WILL, YOU'RE TRYING TO RE-PRIORITIZE YOUR BROTHER THERE WHEN HE'S THINKING, "I NEED TO KILL SOMETHING. I NEED TO CATCH SOMETHING." AND YOU'RE SAYING, "YOU NEED TO MAKE MONEY." I WILL HAVE TO ADMIT, WILLIE, TO HIS CREDIT, AS FAR AS THE BUSINESS SIDE... HE TOOK THE WHOLE THING WAY FURTHER THAN I EVER WOULD. WELL, I WOULD SAY, "YOU DID WELL, MY BOY. SEND ME A CHECK EVERY MONTH." I KNOW ONE THING. I'M BEAT JUST TEARING OUT BEAVER DAMS, I TELL YOU THAT. BUT YOU BETTER NOT BE TOO TIRED. YOU GOT TO GO OUT THERE TONIGHT AND GET SOME FROGS. TONIGHT? YEAH, FOR THE COOKING VIDEO TOMORROW. I HAVE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE ASK ME TO MAKE A COOKING DVD AT MY CHURCH. EVERYWHERE I GO, PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW I COOK MY FOOD. NO. WILLIE. I LOVE IT. WE HAVE TO MAKE THE COOKING DVD TOMORROW. WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO IT TOMORROW? WE'VE ALREADY SOLD THE DVDs. YOU'VE ALREADY SOLD SOME OF THESE COOKING VIDEOS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET US TO ACTUALLY DO? YES. ALL WE HAVE IS A PICTURE OF THE DVD COVER AND NOTHING TO GO INSIDE THE CASE. WHY DO YOU NEED ME FOR THE COOKING DVD? YOU'RE ON THE COVER. TAKE ME OFF THE COVER. IT'S ALREADY IN THE CATALOG. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. AND WE'RE GOING TO GO GET FROGS TONIGHT? I'VE DONE WORSE THINGS THAN FROG-HUNT ALL NIGHT LONG... WAY WORSE. WILL, YOU IN ON THE FROG HUNT? YEP, I'M IN. YOU FIND FROGS BY SHINING YOUR LIGHT, AND YOU'LL SEE THE WHITE PATCH OF BELLY WITH TWO EYES ILLUMINATED. THEY'RE GREEN. IF YOU SEE RED EYES, IT'S A GATOR. THERE'S A FROG. I MEAN A BIG UN. HEY, GO RIGHT TOWARD THEM BUSHES. COMING IN HOT. I SEE HIM. DID YOU GET HIM? YEAH, I GOT HIM. MAN, I HIT MY HEAD, THOUGH. I WOULD RATE JASON ROBERTSON AS ONE OF THE GREATEST FROG CATCHERS OF ALL TIMES. HE'LL SACRIFICE LIFE AND LIMB TO GET THE FROG. DID YOU GET HIM? YEAH, I GOT HIM. OH, YEAH. I HAVE CAUGHT THOUSANDS OF FROGS IN MY LIFE. I'M A FROG'S NIGHTMARE. LITTLE TADPOLES ARE HAVING NIGHTMARES ABOUT ME, BECAUSE I GO IN, AND I TAKE THEM OUT. I WAS JUST BORN THAT WAY. FROG HUNTING'S A THREE-MAN JOB. YOU GOT A MAN CATCHING THEM. THAT'S MY AREA OF EXPERTISE. YOU GOT A MOTORMAN AND AN ICE-CHEST MAN. CALM DOWN. THE CATCHER AND THE MOTORMAN, THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOME SKILLS. THE ICE-CHEST MAN CAN BE ANY HUMAN BEING. SO THAT WAS WILLIE'S JOB. GET HIM, WILLIE. HEY! DON'T YOU BE PEEING ON ME. YOU JUST KISSED HIS BUTT. MISS KAY GONNA BE HAPPY. HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY. HOW MANY DOES THAT MAKE US, WILL? WE GOT PASSEL LOAD OF THEM. IF WE LEAVE RIGHT NOW, I CAN GET YOU ALL BACK AT THE HOUSE AT 3:00 A.M. LET'S CATCH ONE MORE. ONE MORE. WE'VE GOT A $100,000 ORDER TO DO TOMORROW, AND ALL JASE WANTS TO DO IS CATCH ONE MORE FROG. OH! KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED. OH, SNAKE, WILLIE. WILLIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE? WHAT KIND OF SNAKE IS THAT? IT'S NOT THAT I WAS SCARED OF THAT SNAKE. I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF SNAKE IT WAS. I MEAN, IF IT'S POISONOUS, I'M I'M GETTING OUT OF THE BOAT. LOOKED LIKE A DAD GUM WATER MOCCASIN. HE'S ALL RIGHT. HE'S BACK IN THE BOAT. THAT WAS WORTH SEEING, I'LL HAVE TO ADMIT THAT. HEY, LET'S GET BACK ON THE FROGS. YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT. SUCK IT UP. HE'S ACTING LIKE HIS LIFE WAS IN JEOPARDY. WHAT A WEENIE. TOO MANY DAYS IN THE SUBDIVISION. SNAKES FALL OUT OF TREES, YOU GO TO RUNNING. COME ON, COLE MAN, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS. I'VE GOT THESE GRANDKIDS NOW... A PRETTY GOOD PASSEL OF THEM. MY TASK IS TO TEACH THEM TO LIVE OFF THE LAND. IT'S A GOOD THING... CLEAN AND HONORABLE. FROG KILLING. WHAT WAS THAT? THAT'S THE SOUND OF A BULLFROG LOSING HIS HEAD, COLE MAN. THERE'S SOME FINE STUFF THAT GOES OUT HERE IN THIS SWAMP. THAT'S JUST ONE OF THEM RIGHT THERE. I WOULD CONSIDER THAT A DELICACY OF THE HIGHEST ORDER, MR. COLE MAN. YUPPIE GIRLS WOULDN'T LIKE IT. DON'T MARRY SOME YUPPIE GIRL. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? MM-HMM. WELL, ALL THESE GRANDSONS OF MINE, ALL OF WILLIE'S BOYS, JASON'S BOYS, I GIVE THEM A LITTLE RIVER-RAT COUNSELING FREE OF CHARGE. FIND YOU A MEEK, GENTLE, KIND-SPIRITED COUNTRY GIRL. IF SHE KNOWS HOW TO COOK... AND SHE CARRIES HER BIBLE AND LIVES BY IT, AND SHE LOVES TO EAT BULLFROGS... NOW, THERE'S A WOMAN. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? SEE, THE FIRST PREREQUISITE FOR MARRYING A WOMAN, IN MY OPINION... CAN SHE COOK? YOU GONNA BE THERE FOR 50 YEARS, AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER SHE CAN COOK OR NOT? WHAT KIND OF THINKING IS THAT? WELL, WE'LL JUST LIVE OFF LOVE. NOT REALLY. YOU'LL STARVE TO DEATH. SHE DON'T HAVE TO BE A PRETTY GIRL. JUST BECAUSE SHE LOOKS A LITTLE HOMELY, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S HARD TO GET A PRETTY ONE... TO COOK AND CARRY A BIBLE ANYMORE. PASS ME ANOTHER FROG. WHOO. IF I ONLY HAD SOME DUCKS TO TEST THAT OUT ON. THERE'S NOT A DUCK WITHIN 30 MILES OF THIS BUILDING. NO, IT AIN'T. YOU KNOW WHAT'S AROUND HERE? CONCRETE. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE COUNTRY, TOO MUCH CONCRETE. WE NEED TO BUILD A TESTING AND RESEARCH FACILITY FOR THESE DUCK CALLS, BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE THE RESPONSE. WE'RE HURTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. YEAH. DUCK-CALL MAKING IS ALL ABOUT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WHENEVER YOU QUIT RESEARCHING, YOU QUIT DEVELOPING. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS GO TO THE LOADING DOCK WHERE IT'S LOW... IT'S ALREADY A LOW SPOT THERE ALREADY. PLUG THE HOLE, JUST ADD WATER, ADD DUCKS, AND WE GOT IT. AND THEN YOU COME OUT WITH A DUCK CALL, AND YOU SAY, "TESTED AND TRIED WITH REAL DUCKS." YEP. YOU KNOW, THAT'S LIKE WHEN THE ARMY MAKES WEAPONS, THEY HAVE A TESTING RANGE, OKAY, WHERE THEY ACTUALLY TAKE THE PRODUCT OUT AND FIRE IT. A TRUE DUCK HUNTER... HE NEEDS TO HEAR A LIVE DUCK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. YEAH. IT DOES HIS HEART GOOD. GOOD POINT, SI. RIGHT. HEY, ARE WE READY? YES, ARE Y'ALL READY? THAT'S THE QUESTION. I KNOW WILLIE'S GOT PROBLEMS AT THE WAREHOUSE, BUT WE HAVE TO GET THIS DVD DONE TODAY. ALL RIGHT, KAY'S GONNA START IT OFF. SHE'S GOING TO DO A LITTLE "WELCOME TO MISS KAY'S KITCHEN." WHAT ABOUT, "WELCOME, STUDENTS"? DO THAT. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. LET'S JUST DO WHATEVER. LET'S JUST DO IT. I'LL SAY WHEN IT'S TIME. YEAH, YOU START 'EM OFF. OKAY? WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO... THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG. ALL RIGHT. OH, YEAH. YOU GOT ABOUT THREE WORDS OUT. WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO KAY'S COMMANDER KITCHEN. AND I HAVE MY TWO ASSISTANTS THAT I HOPE WILL... DO A... WHAT IS IT? WELCOME, EVERYONE, TO KAY'S COMMANDER KITCHEN. I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT DOING FROGS. CAN WE JUST NOT MAKE THIS? CAN WE JUST RESCHEDULE THIS? PLEASE? ARE YOU SERIOUSLY ASKING ME THAT QUESTION? I'M ALL ABOUT THE COOKING DVD, BUT MY MIND'S REALLY ON THAT DUCK-CALL ORDER THAT WE SCREWED UP. I MEAN, I NEED TO BE UP THERE HELPING THOSE GUYS. IT'S AS IF THE LOADING DOCK WAS JUST REACHING OUT AND CALLING MY NAME, SAYING, "BRING ME SOME DUCKS." HEY, LOOK. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A PIECE OF TRASH. THAT'S A TURTLE. I TOOK THIS TURTLE AS A SIGN THAT THIS IS WHERE THE POND NEEDS TO GO. ALL RIGHT. SEAL HER UP. I HOPE IT HOLDS. OH, YEAH. IT JUST NEEDS TIME. I'M ON THE THRESHOLD OF ONE OF THE GREATEST IDEAS THE CITY OF WEST MONROE HAS EVER KNOWN. IN A MINUTE, WHAT YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT... THAT MAKING A PIE CRUST IS A LOT LIKE COOKING. MAKING A PIE CRUST IS A LOT LIKE COOKING? LIKE SEWING. MAKING A PIE CRUST IS A LOT LIKE COOKING BECAUSE YOU ARE COOKING. 300 DEGREES FOR ABOUT 35 MINUTES, LADIES. ALL RIGHT, LET ME JUST SAY A POINT, PHIL. YOU KEEP TALKING TO, LIKE, LADIES, AND MEN ARE COOKING TOO, SO IT'S NOT JUST GONNA BE LADIES WATCHING THE DVDs... YEAH, GIRLY MEN... ALL THE GIRLY MEN. NO, ARE YOU A GIRLY MAN? YEAH, BUT YOU'RE A MAN. WHAT T YOU HAVE IS FROG LEGS HERE. YOU MARINATE THEM FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. SO YOU JUST POUR A LITTLE BUTTERMILK ON THEM... WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. HOW MUCH BUTTERMILK ARE YOU PUTTING IN THERE? YOU'RE JUST DUMPING BUTTERMILK... NO AMOUNT. IS THERE AN AMOUNT? IS THERE, LIKE... ANY AMOUNT. THEY JUST ALL NEED TO LOOK WET. NO AMOUNT, ANY AMOUNT. OKAY, YOU NEED TO SAY THAT. THEN SAY THAT ON THE... SAY IT. PRETEND LIKE... WELL, IF YOU ALL WILL BE QUIET FOR MAYBE JUST FIVE SECONDS. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I CAN DO THIS. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. IN AMERICA, THE ART OF COOKING HAS DROPPED TO SUCH A LOW LEVEL, 'CAUSE, I MEAN, THIS MICROWAVE STUFF, YOU KNOW... OH, IT'S PITIFUL. ALL RIGHT, I THINK THAT'S GOOD. HERE'S THE DEAL, PHIL. YOU'VE BEEN COOKING FOR... 50 YEARS. YOU KNOW WHAT... YOU'RE CORRECT. TO DO WITH THE FROG LEGS. YOU'RE CORRECT. YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS. WE DON'T KNOW THAT. I JUST TOLD YOU. LIKE, THE VIEWER DOES NOT KNOW THAT. I JUST SHOWED YOU. POUR BUTTERMILK IN THERE. LET'S JUST GO TO THE NEXT THING. I MEAN, IT'S HOLDING. IT'S HOLDING. HEY, JASE. HEY, JOHN. HEY, LINDA. WHAT YOU BOYS DOING UP IN HERE? WELL, WE'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING A RESEARCH POND FOR DUCKS IN THE LOADING DOCK. WHERE ARE THE TRUCKS GOING TO UNLOAD? WE HAVE IT ALL UNDER CONTROL. IT'S GONNA GET UGLY AROUND HERE. OH, WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT. DID YOU? UH, IT CROSSED MY MIND. BUT, I MEAN, I'M TELLING YOU, I'M TRYING TO DO SOMETHING REVOLUTIONARY HERE. AND SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT WHERE THE TRUCKS ARE GOING TO PULL IN AND OUT. ALL RIGHT, I'LL START THIS OFF WITH "STUDENTS". REMEMBER WHEN WE DID THAT BEFORE? KAY, DO THE VIDEO. OH. YEAH, DON'T KEEP SAYING, "REMEMBER WHEN WE DID THAT?" WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING HERE. WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR THREE HOURS WITH THIS COOKING DVD, AND WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR FINISHED. I SAY WE MAKE A COOKING DVD ON HOW TO NOT MAKE COOKING DVDs. AT THE RATE YOU'RE GOING, THIS GONNA BE ABOUT 1:00 OR 2:00 IN THE MORNING BEFORE Y'ALL KNOCK THIS LITTLE BABY OUT. NO, WE'RE GONNA GET IT. HELLO? WILLIE, THE GUYS ARE OUT THERE, AND THEY'RE FLOODING THE LOADING DOCK. YOU NEED TO GET UP HERE. I'LL BE THERE IN 30 MINUTES. NO, YOU CAN'T LEAVE. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. HEY, THEY'RE FLOODING THE LOADING DOCK. WILLIE. HE'S GONE. OH, WE GOT A BUNCH OF HAPPY DUCKS IN THIS LITTLE OLD POND. I MEAN, DOESN'T IT DO YOUR HEART GOOD TO BRING THIS MUCH JOY AND HAPPINESS TO THE PET-STORE DUCKS? WHEN I SAW THOSE DUCKS COME OUT OF THAT CAGE AND INTO THE POND, IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST FULFILLING MOMENTS THAT I'VE EVER HAD. YEP, I ACTUALLY THINK IT'LL WORK, JASE. OH, IT'LL WORK. THEY'RE HAPPY. YEP. ALL WE NEED IS SOME DUCK CALLS. THAT'S IT. WHAT YOU THINK? WHAT DO I THINK? THIS IS STUPID. THIS WHOLE THING IS STUPID. WE THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE IT. YOU THINK I WOULD LIKE YOU FLOODING THE LOADING DOCK? I FIGURE THEY CAN PULL IN THAT HATCH RIGHT THERE. NO! THIS IS THE LOADING DOCK! WE HAVE A REAL BUSINESS. WE SHIP REAL ORDERS. I'VE BEEN UP FOR, LIKE, 40 HOURS. I'M DOWN THERE MAKING A STUPID DVD. AND I GET BACK HERE, AND I LOOK AT THIS SH... THE DUMPSTER'S IN THE WATER. HOW WE GONNA MOVE THE GARBAGE? EVERYBODY HERE IS DOING NOTHING. AND I CAN'T FIRE YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE KIN TO ME! NOW, WILLIE... WELL, HE WAS JUST HAVING A BAD, BAD WEEK. YOU KNOW, THE WOES OF RUNNING A BUSINESS WERE KIND OF PILED UP ON HIM. GOT TOO MANY IRONS IN THE FIRE. EVERYBODY GET BACK IN THERE. WE'RE DOING OUR JOB. WE WILL STAY UP HERE ALL NIGHT TO GET THE ORDER FINISHED. WHATEVER. I GOT IT. LET'S GO TO WORK, BOYS. DID IT EVEN WORK, ANYWAY? DID WHAT WORK? THE STUPID BOOTLEG POND OUT THERE IN THE LOADING DOCK. WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO SEE. WE WERE AT THE FINISH LINE, AND YOU PULLED UP GUNS A-BLAZING. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, WE'RE BACK IN HERE. AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME THAT SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN, YOU'RE NOT A LITTLE BIT CURIOUS ON WHETHER IT WOULD WORK OR NOT. YOU WANT TO GO FIND OUT, LITTLE BROTHER? THIS IS PRETTY COOL. IT IS. I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS MY IDEA. I THINK I TOLD YOU, LIKE, FIVE YEARS AGO I WANTED TO DO THIS. NO, IT WAS NOT. NO, I DID, SERIOUSLY. IT WAS NOT. OH, LIKE, FIVE YEARS AGO, I TOLD YOU THIS IDEA. FIVE YEARS AGO? YEAH, I SAID I WANTED DUCKS AT THE OFFICE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YOU CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR. ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU'RE GONNA COME UP WITH FIVE YEARS, IT WAS YOUR IDEA? NO, I'M TELLING YOU. I THINK THAT'S WHAT PUT IT IN YOUR MIND. PHIL, GET THE TEA. OH, I'M READY TO EAT. I NEED THAT RIGHT HERE. OH, I'LL SIT THEM RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, HONEY. HE'S COMING. I GOT ONE MORE BATCH, BUT THIS OUGHT TO HOLD US FOR A WHILE. FATHER, WE THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER GOOD DAY ON PLANET EARTH. WE DO THANK YOU FOR THESE GOOD FISH YOU BLESSED US WITH, AMEN. All: AMEN. DIG IN. NOBODY DRIVES US CRAZY LIKE OUR OWN FAMILY. THEY'RE ODD. THEY PUSH OUR BUTTONS. THEY'RE THE SOURCE OF OUR BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS, BUT ALSO OUR GREATEST JOY. IT'S NOT ALWAYS GONNA RUN SMOOTHLY, AND WE'RE NOT ALWAYS GONNA AGREE, BUT IN THE END, WE'RE A FAMILY FIRST AND A BUSINESS SECOND.
