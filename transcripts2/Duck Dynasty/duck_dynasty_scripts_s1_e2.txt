 OH, LET'S GET THEM. NOT BAD, BOYS. THAT'S SOME PRETTY FANCY SHOOTING DOWN THERE, JASE. I WAS TWO FOR TWO. YOU DIDN'T GET IN ON ANY OF THAT, WILL? UH-UH. WHY ARE YOU PLAYING WITH THAT? WHY WOULD YOU BRING YOUR PHONE TO A DUCK HUNT? HE'S ABOUT THAT TELEPHONE, JASE, LIKE YOU ARE WITH YOUR SHOTGUN. WILLIE, I DON'T THINK YOU HIT ONE DUCK ALL DAY. YOU'RE JUST BASICALLY A BIRD WATCHER.

 WE SHOT THEM DUCKS AND WILLIE WAS ON THAT TEXT MESSAGE. HE NEVER MOVED. NEVER MOVED. NEVER MOVED. THESE GUYS KNOW HOW TO DUCK HUNT, BUT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IS RUN A COMPANY. THAT'S MY LIFE, YOU KNOW? BUT THESE CLOWNS, I MEAN, THEY DON'T RESPECT ANYTHING, ESPECIALLY HARD WORK AND DEDICATION. WHY DOES THIS PHONE KEEP RINGING? I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT. YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE STRESSED OUT? BACK ON THE CELL PHONE. THIS PHONE RINGS EVERY FIVE SECONDS.

I SHOT, HE DIED. I BEEN LISTENING TO Y'ALL ALL MORNING LONG. BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, WHO GOT WHAT? FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER, MY CHILDREN ARE SUPER COMPETITIVE. I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHY. I GUESS IT CAME FROM ME. THE OLD GENE POOL RUNS DEEP. THE OLD GENE POOL RUNS DEEP. THE OLD GENE POOL RUNS DEEP. HERE THEY COME. HOWDY, HOWDY, HOWDY. THEY BEEN SLAVING OVER A BIG BREAKFAST. IS IT READY, MISS KAY? IT IS READY TO EAT. WHERE'S ALL THE YOUNG'UNS? I DON'T KNOW. ASK THEIR DADS. I THINK THEY'RE AT HOME PLAYING VIDEO GAMES. IT'S WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO. PLAYING VIDEO GAMES? MM-HMM. LET ME TELL YOU BOYS SOMETHING. UH-OH, A SERMON COMING. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A MACHO MAN SITTING AROUND A LITTLE BLACK BOX? NOPE, SO I'M TELLING Y'ALL RIGHT NOW, YOU NEED TO GET THEM KIDS OUT OF THAT CRAP. KIDS IN AMERICA TODAY ARE FAT. I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT THESE LITTLE GAMES... IT'S JUST YOUR FINGERS THAT YOU'RE MOVING. YOU'RE NOT OUT AND ABOUT. LAZY. I TELL YOU WHAT LET'S DO. WE'LL GET THEM GRANDKIDS. I GOT A LITTLE PIECE OF GROUND, A LOT OF BRUSH AND STUFF IN THERE. AND HAVE THEM CLEAN THAT WHOLE THING AS SLICK AS A BUTTON. YOU KNOW, IT'S PAPAW WORK DAY. WHAT THEY WON'T KNOW IS THAT WE'RE GONNA TURN THAT INTO A FOOTBALL FIELD FOR THE ROBERTSON FAMILY... OH, THAT'S AWESOME. FOOTBALL GAME. THE ROBERTSONS LOVE FOOTBALL. I MEAN, IT'S OUR PASSION. PHIL PLAYED IN COLLEGE, WAS A STAR. WE ALL PLAY. WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. I'M ONE OF THE COACHES. I JUST WISH WE HAD MORE TIME TO PRACTICE. WILLIE. THIS IS JUST FOR FUN. AIN'T NOTHING FOR FUNSIES IN THIS FAMILY. THIS IS FOR REAL. HE NEEDS TO PRACTICE A LITTLE BIT. I COULD PRACTICE IF I HAD YO' JOB. OH, YEAH, I MEAN... YOU WOULDN'T MAKE IT ONE DAY DOING WHAT I DO. OH! ONE DAY. WE DOIN' ALL THE WORK ALREADY. HAVING WILLIE AS MY BOSS, IT'S LIKE DATING YOUR COUSIN. IT'S A BIT WEIRD. YOU WANT MY JOB? I'LL TAKE OVER. JASE IS THE CEO FOR THE DAY. WHAT? THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN. LETTING JASE FAIL IS PROBABLY THE BEST LESSON I CAN TEACH HIM. HOPEFULLY HE'LL GAIN SOME RESPECT AND, UH, REALIZE, A LOT MORE TO IT THAN HOW EASY I MAKE IT LOOK. ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE IN CHARGE. I GOT IT. I'LL TAKE THE CHALLENGE. HOW HARD CAN IT BE? YOU CAN DO IT, MAN. I JUST GOT PROMOTED IN ABOUT 12 SECONDS. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. COULD WE GO UNDER IN ONE DAY? WELL, BOYS, WILLIE IS GONE. HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IN ME AND WILLIE IS? WHAT? I MAKE THIS LOOK GOOD. AND GUESS WHAT ELSE. I GOT SOME RULES. UNBELIEVABLE. HE'S FIXIN' TO GO ON A POWER TRIP. THE NUMBER ONE RULE IS... THERE ARE NO RULES. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I LIKE THAT NOW. I LIKE THAT. I CAN LIVE WITH THIS. THERE AIN'T A BUSINESS BONE IN JASON'S BODY. JASON'S GOT JUST ABOUT AS MUCH BUSINESS SENSE AS A STICK OF BUTTER. WILLIE THINKS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE MISERABLE TO GET SOMETHING ACCOMPLISHED. WE WILL WORK AND HAVE A GOOD TIME DOING IT. OH, YEAH. AS A DUCK CALL BUILDER, I KNOW THE NEEDS OF THE COMMON PEOPLE. I SPEAK DUCK. CALL ME A QUACK. IT'S RIGHT ON TARGET. ANYBODY GOT ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT? NOPE, I UNDERSTOOD THAT PERFECTLY! NOW YOU'RE TALKING MY LANGUAGE. RED, WHEN THEY GET HERE, I WANT THEM TO BREAK OUT A SWEAT. ALL RIGHT. THE ROBERTSON CLAN WENT FROM POOR TO RICH. SO I'M DEALING NOW WITH LITTLE RICH KIDS. NOW THAT'S A GOOD LOOKING BUNCH OF GRANDKIDS RIGHT THERE. I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP THEM SEE THEIR CORE VALUES. SO YOU'RE GONNA LEARN THE OLD ROBERTSON WAY OF CLEARING YOU A GARDEN SPOT. ARE Y'ALL READY TO GET IT? YES, SIR. BY THE WAY, ANYBODY GOT A CELL PHONE ON 'EM? WELL, LOOKIE HERE WHAT WE GOT HERE. SEE THIS THING RIGHT HERE? YOU NEVER SWEAT USING THIS. YOU NEVER WORK. YOU JUST ON THIS JUST LIKE THIS. I DON'T OWN A CELL PHONE AT ALL. NATURE... THEY NEED TO GET INTO THAT MORE. LOOKING 'ROUND WHAT THE ALMIGHTY CREATED. I'M A LOW-TECH MAN IN A HIGH-TECH WORLD. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CONTRAPTIONS ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. SEE THAT HERE? Y'ALL GOTTA REMEMBER... PART OF BEING A ROBERTSON IS KNOWING HOW TO LIVE OFF THE LAND. WE'RE GONNA LEARN ABOUT A HARD DAY'S WORK. HELLO? ALL RIGHT. YOU DONE? YEP. I WANT YOU TO START ON THAT FAR END, AND WHEN YOU GET DONE, SMOOTH AS A BABY'S BUTT ALL THE WAY. IT'S A NEW CONCEPT FOR Y'ALL. WORK. NOW GET Y'ALL'S TAIL DOWN THERE. All: YES, SIR. I MEAN, WORK LIKE THERE AIN'T NO TOMORROW. IT'S GONNA TAKE TILL TOMORROW. WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE, BABE? HOW DID YOU MANAGE THIS? BEING AN ALUMNI HAS ITS ADVANTAGES. WOW. WHAT DO YOU THINK? "WILLIE'S TRAINING COMBINE." I ADMIT, I'M IMPRESSED. KORIE'S MY WIFE, SO SHE PROBABLY WANTS TO BE ON MY TEAM. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT IS SHE'S TERRIBLE. COOL. LOOK AT THIS. LUCKILY, COACH WILLIE'S IN THE HOUSE. WHAT ARE WE DOING? ALL RIGHT. IF SOMEHOW I CAN GET WHAT'S IN HERE IN HERE... OH. NO DOUBT, WE WIN. I THOUGHT THIS WHOLE DEAL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE, LIKE, A FAMILY GAME FOR THE KIDS TO LEARN A LESSON. IT IS A FAMILY GAME, BUT IT'S A FAMILY GAME WE'RE GONNA WIN. MY MASTER PLAN FOR KORIE IS TO TURN HER INTO A LEAN, MEAN FOOTBALL MACHINE. THIS DRILL'S GONNA WORK ON YOUR HANDS, ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, I'M READY. WHEN THE BALL COMES, I WANT YOUR HANDS TO GET SOFT. JUST LIKE YOU'RE CATCHING A BIRD. YOU DON'T WANNA KILL IT. I GOT IT, COME ON. HEY, CHECK YOURSELF. YOU'RE GONNA WRECK YOURSELF. WATCH IT IN. OH! OW. BABE, YOU HIT ME IN THE FACE. I DON'T CARE. LET YOUR NOSE HURTING MOTIVATE YOU. BACK IN POSITION, LET'S GO. WE'RE GONNA GET OURSELVES IN SHAPE AND WE'RE GONNA BE READY FOR THIS FOOTBALL GAME. WE GOTTA GET THESE ORDERS OUT HERE. SO HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. BEING THE CEO OF THIS COMPANY IS EASY. MY WHOLE IDEA IS GETTING THE WORK DONE WITHOUT KNOWING IT. WE'RE GONNA WORK AND WE'RE GONNA ENJOY IT. THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT WHO IS THE FASTEST DUCK CALL MAKER. NO, THERE IS NO DEBATE. NO, NO DEBATE. IT'S ME. ME. THE FIRST ONE TO TEN... WELL, THIS WON'T TAKE LONG. WINS. GO! HERE WE GO. THAT'S ALL OF IT. BETTER STEP IT UP A NOTCH. DING DING. DING DING. MY PLAN AS THE CEO IS TO INSPIRE. THEY GET EXCITED, ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU LOOK UP AND THEY'RE DOING THINGS THEY NEVER DREAMED THEY COULD DO. BIG BOYS NEVER GET TO WIN A RACE. I'M KIND OF EXCITED ABOUT THE CHANCE. DING DING. IT'S COMING DOWN TO THE WIRE. DING. NINE-EIGHT GODWIN! GIVING SI THE DUCK CALL. DING. NINE-NINE. HE'S DOWN, HE'S DOWN, HE'S DOWN. CALL! DING! BOOM! THERE'S THE WINNER! YEAH! MARTIN WINS. THAT'S THE BEST I'VE FELT ABOUT DOING WORK IN A LONG TIME. YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEAUTY OF THIS IS? WHAT? Y'ALL MADE 19 DUCK CALLS IN UNDER 2 MINUTES. I COULD POSSIBLY BE THE GREATEST CEO EVER. PAPAW PHIL, HOW ARE WE GONNA MOVE THIS? ONE OF YOU'S GONNA PICK UP ONE END AND ONE OF YOU'S GONNA PICK UP THE OTHER END AND THROW IT UP ON THAT TRAILER. WATCH YOUR FINGERS. HAVING GRANDKIDS IS A GREAT BLESSING. COME ON UP, PRETTY BOYS. ESPECIALLY FOR HEAVY LIFTING. THEY'RE MORPHING INTO PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS OF AMERICA. COME ON THERE, KIDS. YOU'RE IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS. BE HAPPY. MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE! MY ASSESSMENT OF KORIE, I'VE DETERMINED THAT... SHE CAN'T CATCH. SHE CAN'T RUN REAL GOOD. FASTER, FASTER! SHE HAS A TERRIBLE ATTITUDE. I'M GETTING SICK OF THIS. I'M STRUGGLING TO FIND ANYTHING REALLY THAT SHE'S GOOD AT IN THE GAME OF FOOTBALL. KNEES UP. WE'RE RUNNING DRILLS. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO, LIKE, KILL EACH OTHER. HUT! HUT. GO. OH, OH, AAH, AAH, AAH! GET UP, DO IT AGAIN. WILLIE, I'M DONE. KORIE'S JUST UNCOACHABLE. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. I'M GONE. I DON'T THINK SHE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR TEAM WILLIE. BUT I DIDN'T MARRY HER FOR HER FOOTBALL SKILLS, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. BYE. SHE GONE. ORDER READY. OH! WHOO! WE'RE CHANGING THE FACE OF THE COMPANY... IN 24 HOURS. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK BEING DONE. WE DONE IT NOW. BUT IN THE WORKPLACE, STRESS IS THE KILLER. SIT IT RIGHT HERE? YEAH. SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED A LITTLE TIME TO UNWIND. AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'RE JOUSTING WITH A BOX OVER YOU, SEEING WHO'S A MAN. GO! OOH! I'VE DONE MY JOB HERE TODAY. OH, MAN. I TOLD YOU I WAS THE FASTEST DUCK CALL BUILDER OUT OF... HEY! WHAT'S ALL THAT JUNK SHRINK-WRAPPED? NO, THAT'S PROBABLY FOR TOMORROW. THEY PROBABLY GOT IT PACKED UP... NO, THAT'S FOR TODAY. UH-OH. IF WE MISS THE ORDER, I KNOW I'M GONNA FEEL THE WRATH OF WILLIE. WELL, THAT'S A BIG ONE. THAT AIN'T GONNA FIT IN MY PICKUP. WE GOTTA TAKE THE 18-WHEELER? WE AIN'T GOT NOBODY TO DRIVE THE 18-WHEELER. HEY, IF YOU CAN CRANK IT, I CAN DRIVE IT, JACK. UH... I DON'T KNOW. I DROVE A TANKER IN VIETNAM. I CAN DRIVE AN 18-WHEELER. SOMETIMES IN LIFE, YOU DO HAVE TO TRUST UNLIKELY CANDIDATES. ARE YOU SERIOUS? I... HEY, I'M DEAD SERIOUS. THE DOOR HAS BEEN SHUT. THE WINDOW HAPPENS TO BE AN 18-WHEELER WITH SI DRIVING. HEY, LET'S GO. IT'S A SMALL WINDOW. BUT IT IS A WINDOW OF HOPE. YOU BETTER HURRY UP. SI GONNA LEAVE WITHOUT YOU. THAT'S GOOD. HEY, HEY! HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY, HEY! AH, LET HIM GO. HE'LL FIGURE IT OUT SOONER OR LATER. ALL RIGHT, BIG TEAM. LOOK HERE. I AM THOROUGHLY PLEASED WITH WHAT Y'ALL HAVE DONE HERE TODAY. Y'ALL REPORT BACK HERE TOMORROW AND I GOT ONE MORE LITTLE JOB FOR YOU WHEN YOU GET HERE. I'M PRETTY FIRED UP ABOUT SHOWING THE KIDS THE FIELD. I MEAN, THEY'LL BE SURPRISED. SAME TIME TOMORROW. All: YES, SIR. GOOD WORK. THANK YOU. THEY'LL LOVE IT. LET'S GO. GONNA BE SORE TOMORROW. DEFINITELY. SO HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOU'VE DRIVEN A TRUCK LIKE THIS?

YOU KNOW, THERE WERE SEVEN KIDS IN THE ROBERTSON FAMILY AND AFTER ALL THE SMOKE CLEARED, ALL OF THEM BUT ONE HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES. I'VE GOTTA KNOW. WHO'S THE ONLY ROBERTSON THAT DOESN'T HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE? LOOK DEEP WITHIN THE EYES OF SILAS ROBERTSON AND YOU'LL SAY, "NO, THERE AIN'T NO COLLEGE DEGREE THERE." ARE YOU KIDDING ME? OH, MY GOODNESS. THERE'S NOBODY HERE. IT'S OVER. WE DIDN'T MAKE IT. WE'RE NEVER GONNA HEAR THE END OF THIS FROM WILLY. YOU GOTTA PUT THE BLAME WHERE IT BELONGS.

THE PRESSURE IS ON. IT'S A PASS. I'VE GOT IT. OH, INTERCEPTION! TOUCHDOWN! BALL GAME! IT'S GONNA BE EASIER TO TELL WILLIE THAT WE MISSED THE SHIPMENT WHEN HE'S MIRED IN THE HUMILIATION OF A DEFEAT. HEY, WILL, LOOK HERE. LET ME HELP HIM UP. LOSING TO JASE IS JUST HUMILIATING. I MEAN, JUST THE THOUGHT OF IT MAKES ME SICK. I'M GONNA HEAR ABOUT THIS ALL YEAR. YEAH, THIS MAY BE A TERRIBLE TIME TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT, UH, WE MISSED THAT ORDER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU MISSED IT? IT DID NOT GET TO ITS DESTINATION. DID YOU SEE HOW BIG THAT ORDER WAS? OH, YEAH, IT WAS HUGE. YOU HAD ONE JOB TO DO. NO, I... I DID A GOOD JOB. WE JUST HAD ONE MISHAP. JASE, YOU GOTTA THINK ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE. WELL, LET ME EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU. I DON'T WANNA BE CEO. I UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURES OF IT. I DON'T WANT THAT. YOU DO A GOOD JOB. FROM NOW ON, I'LL GIVE YOU MORE RESPECT. JASE IS AN IDIOT, BUT HE'S MY BROTHER. WHEN I NEED TO DEPEND ON HIM, HE'LL BE THERE. SO YOU'RE NOT MAD AT US? NO, I AIN'T MAD. WELL, HE'S NOT THE BEST CEO IN THE WORLD, BUT THAT'S WHY IT'S A TEAM. WE HAVE TO RELY ON EACH OTHER. GROWING UP AROUND THESE PARTS, YOU FIND HARD WORK AND FAMILY GO HAND IN HAND. FATHER, THANK YOU FOR THESE GOOD FISH YOU PROVIDED US WITH. YOU'VE ALWAYS PROVIDED US FROM THE THINGS THAT LIVE IN THE WOODS AND THE WATER AND WE ARE THANKFUL. AMEN. All: AMEN. DIG IN! WHEN A FAMILY BANDS TOGETHER, THERE'S NO LIMIT TO HOW MUCH YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH. COMPETITION AND SIBLING RIVALRY, THAT'S JUST HOW WE CHALLENGE EACH OTHER TO BE EVEN BETTER. AND AFTER A WHILE, YOU COME TO REALIZE THAT WORKING HARD AND HAVING FUN AIN'T THAT MUCH DIFFERENT. HEY, WILLIE, WHEN YOU GET HOME, GIVE YOUR WIFE A KISS FOR ME. SHE PLAYS A HELL OF A GAME.
