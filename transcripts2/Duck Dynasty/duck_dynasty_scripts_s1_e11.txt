YOU'VE GOT A PERFECTLY GOOD PICKUP WITH GOOD TIRES ON IT, AND NOW YOU'RE TAKING 'EM OFF AND PUTTING ON SOMETHING PRETTY. LIKE, PRETTY TIRES ARE FOR SISSY REDNECKS. THIS THING'S GONNA BOG DOWN. NO, IT AIN'T GONNA BOG DOWN. YEAH, IT'S GONNA BOG DOWN. FIRST IT'S PRETTY TIRES, THEN IT'S PRETTY GUNS. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SHAVING YOUR BEARD AND WEARING CAPRI PANTS. THIS THING'S A PIECE OF JUNK. PIECE OF JUNK? IT'S A SISSY SPIRAL. OUT OF CONTROL. SI, THIS IS WORTH MORE THAN MONEY. WHEN THE STOCK MARKET CRASHES, THE MAN THAT COMES OUT ON TOP IS THE MAN WITH THE MOST TIRES. THEY'RE CURRENCY. YOU TRADE 'EM. YOU BUY 'EM. YOU SELL 'EM. YOU RETIRE ON 'EM. DID YOU PAY FOR THAT PIECE OF JUNK? NO, I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS. I TRADED BEAVER PELTS. THAT WASN'T A GOOD TRADE. NOT FOR A FINE BEAVER PELT. THAT'S THE ONLY WATERPROOF FUR THERE IS IS A BEAVER. WHEN IT ALL GOES SOUTH, YOU KNOW WHAT'LL BE AT THE TOP OF THE HEAP? WHAT'S THAT? MUD GRIPS. WELL, AS LONG AS YOU DIDN'T GIVE 'EM CASH MONEY. THIS IS GREATER THAN CASH MONEY. WHAT DO YOU SAY, WILL? WHAT ABOUT IT, WILL? OH, SADIE'S GOT A BOYFRIEND. THEY'RE WANTIN' TO GO TO A DANCE TOGETHER. IS HE A GOOD GUY? I DON'T KNOW, I'VE NEVER MET HIM. UH-OH. I MEAN, YOU GOT TO MEET THE BOY, YOU KNOW? FIND OUT WHAT YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT HIM. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE DO. LET'S TAKE HIM HUNTING. YOU CAN SEE THE HEART OF A MAN WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN THE WOODS AND THERE'S WEAPONS AROUND. THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT A TERRIBLE IDEA. AND IF THE BOY AIN'T ON THE UP AND UP, GUESS WHAT. HE'LL RUN FOR THE HILLS. I MEAN, IF YOU'VE GOTTA MEET YOUR DAUGHTER'S FRIEND, WHO HAPPENS TO BE A BOY, WHAT BETTER WAY THAN WITH A SHOTGUN IN YOUR HAND? LET'S DO IT. WE'LL DO IT TOMORROW? YEAH. WORRYING KILLS THE SOUL. HEY, LET'S ATTACK IT. "YOU WANT TO DATE MY DAUGHTER? ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE TRIP?" YOU GOT IT? YEAH, WE GOT IT. THEM TIRES ARE FREAKING SWEET. SEE, SI? THEM ARE SISSY TIRES. THEM AIN'T SWEET. KORIE, HEY. I'M WORRIED ABOUT THIS BEAU DEAL. I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED OR ANYTHING. THEY'RE JUST GOING TO A DANCE. HOW ABOUT I TAKE HIM OUT AND GET TO KNOW HIM IN THE WOODS? TAKING HIM OUT IN THE WOODS? NO, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. KORIE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION. I HAVE TO GET TO KNOW THIS KID. I JUST WANT TO TAKE HIM OUT... CUT HIS HEAD OFF, PUT IT UP THERE WITH MY TROPHIES. JUST TO GET TO KNOW HIM. WHAT'S HEAVIER, A TON OF BRICKS OR A TON OF FEATHERS? DUCK OR GOOSE FEATHERS? THEY'RE NOT EQUAL. I JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT HE'S ALL ABOUT. A TON OF BRICKS AND A TON OF FEATHERS ARE EQUAL. NO, WE TAKE HIM OUT. MAYBE THE DENSITY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT? YEAH, AND WE GO ON, LIKE, A HUNT. WELL, I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA LIKE HIM. HE'S A NICE KID. IT'LL BE GOOD. ALL RIGHT, I'LL PROVIDE THE WEAPONS. OH, NO. BABE, DO NOT SCARE HIM. REALLY, WILLIE. WHAT? ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, BYE. OH, BOY. WHO SAID STOP WORKING? WELL, WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE WHILE YOU WERE ON THE PHONE. PLUS, I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS LITTLE DEAL YOU WAS JUST TALKIN' ABOUT. HEY. HAVING A TEENAGE DAUGHTER IS VERY NERVE-RACKING. IT'S LIKE SADIE'S A PIECE OF CHICKEN OUT IN THE SWAMP. THERE'S GATORS EVERYWHERE. AND THOSE GATORS ARE 14-YEAR-OLD BOYS. I DON'T WANT MY DAUGHTER GOING OUT WITH SOMEBODY I DON'T EVEN KNOW. GOING TO A DANCE AND RUBBING AND SHAKING. MAKE SURE, NUMBER ONE, HE AIN'T ONE OF THEM BOYS THAT'S GOT ALL THIS CRAP PUNCTURED IN HIS EAR AND HANGING OUT OF HIS EYEBROW AND OUT OF HIS NOSE AND ALL THAT JUNK. I DON'T CARE WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE. OH, I WOULD. WILL NEEDS TO LEARN THIS. HEY, YOU GIVE THIS BOY, YOU KNOW, A LOOK... YOU KNOW? IT'S ONE OF THEM DEALS ABOUT, "HEY, YOU FOOL AROUND, I'LL KILL YOU, BOY." TALKING ABOUT, "HEY." LOOK, ALL YOU GOTTA TELL HIM IS, "YOU MAKE HER CRY, I'LL MAKE YOU CRY." YOU AIN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACCIDENTS. I DON'T KNOW HOW I MADE MY WAY INTO THE DUCK CALL ROOM TO GET ADVICE. YOU CAN'T STOP THE BEES FROM BUZZING. ESPECIALLY ADVICE ON MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER. SHE MAY PICK SOME LOSER. THEN YOU BRING IN A BALL-PEEN HAMMER. "HEY, I'M WATCHING YOU, BOY. LIKE A HAWK." THIS AIN'T EVEN ADVICE ANYMORE. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A MAN LIKE ME, AREN'T YOU? BE HONEST. I LIKE CHILI DOGS. ALL RIGHT, LOOK HERE. "YOUR DADDY BROUGHT YOU IN THIS WORLD, I'LL TAKE YOU OUT OF THIS WORLD." ONE BAD IDEA AFTER ANOTHER. GUN IN ONE HAND, BIBLE IN THE OTHER, AND THEN YOU JUST STAND OVER HIM. FEAR IS A HEALTHY THING. BUT YOU'RE NOT QUITE AS IMPOSING OF A FIGURE AS I AM. WHAT, I HAVE TO BE MORBIDLY OBESE TO SCARE SOMEBODY AND STAND OVER 'EM? IF YOU'RE AT 14, A MAN COMES IN HERE, JUST LIKE THIS. HE'S STANDING... HE'S GOT A GUN AND HIS BIBLE... AND HE'S STANDING JUST LIKE THIS. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO DO? ARE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE AT ALL RIGHT NOW? GET OUT OF MY FACE. YOU'RE CREEPING ME OUT. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WHY YOU GOING THE OTHER WAY? WELL, YOU'RE STICKING YOUR JUNK ALL IN MY FACE. NOW YOU'RE MOVING AWAY. SEE, THIS IS THE POINT OF IT. YEAH, THAT'S THE POINT OF IT RIGHT THERE. YOU'RE OUT OF HERE. RUN HIM OFF. WE'RE GOING ON A HUNTING TRIP, PERIOD. AND THE ONLY THING STANDING IN THE WAY OF THIS BOY AND SADIE IS ME, MY SHOTGUN, AND A HEALTHY DOSE OF FEAR. THAT WAS THE WORST ADVICE I'VE EVER GOTTEN. THE FIRST PLACE WE NEED TO GO IS THE PRIVET HOLE BLIND, 'CAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST PLACE THEY START TO INFEST. ARE YOU LISTENING TO WHAT I'M SAYING? YEAH. YOU'RE STILL HUNG UP ON THIS GUY? YEAH. I'M TAKING BEAU TO THE PRIVET HOLE TO HUNT SNAKES. I WANT THIS KID TO GET TO KNOW WHO HE'S GOING TO BE ANSWERING TO WHILE HE'S DATING MY DAUGHTER. I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT SNAKES, I'M WORRIED ABOUT THAT SNAKE. WELL, HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW HE'S A SNAKE? THEY'RE ALL SNAKES. LISTEN, IT'S A DATE. IT AIN'T LIKE THEY GONNA GET MARRIED. EVERY TIME YOU GET MARRIED, IT STARTS WITH A DATE. THAT'S TRUE. WILLIE, LIGHTEN UP. KAY, HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU MET PHIL? I WAS A MATURE 14-YEAR-OLD. HOW WAS PHIL? OH, HE WAS HORRIBLE. EXACTLY. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU GOTTA BE TACTFUL ABOUT IT. WHAT ARE YOU, A DATING COUNSELOR OR SOMETHING? WHEN IT COMES TO DATING RELATIONSHIPS, YOU GOT TO BE SHREWD AS A SNAKE AND HARMLESS AS A DOVE. IF YOU TRY TO KEEP 'EM APART, THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE MESSING UP, 'CAUSE THEN THEY GONNA JUST GO ROMEO AND JULIET ON YOU. HEY. HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? BEAU, IS THAT YOU? GOOD TO MEET YOU, MAN. NICE TO MEET YOU. SADIE'S BOYFRIEND. WILLIE'S MY KID BROTHER. I'M THERE WHEN HE NEEDS ME. AND BASED ON THE LOOK IN HIS EYES... THIS IS BEAU. NICE TO MEET YOU. I THINK HE NEEDS ME. YOU EVER HUNTED BEFORE, BEAU? YES, SIR. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. ALL RIGHT, GIRLS, Y'ALL HEAD IN THE HOUSE. IT'S MAN TIME. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. GOOD LUCK, BEAU. THANK YOU. BE NICE, DAD. OH, HE'S GONNA BE NERVOUS, ALL RIGHT. HE BETTER BE. I WANT THIS KID TO BE PEEING IN HIS PANTS BY THE END OF THE DAY. WHAT KIND OF GUN DO YOU SHOOT? 20-GAUGE. WHAT KIND OF SHELLS? 2 3/4 FULL SHELL. BEAU KNOWS GUNS. SO HAVE YOU HAD A GIRLFRIEND BEFORE? YES, SIR. HOW MANY? YOU KNOW WHAT BOYS ARE ALL ABOUT AT THAT AGE? I DO, BECAUSE I WAS THAT AGE. I HAD A SMALL BEARD AT THAT TIME, AND, UH, IT WAS HARD KEEPING 'EM OFF OF ME, HONESTLY. HOW LONG Y'ALL BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER? 2 1/2 MONTHS. NOBODY TOLD ME. NOPE. I AIN'T SAYING IT WAS RIGHT THOUGH. ARE YOU SERIOUS, WILLIE? IT WAS LIKE AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO A CRIME THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN COMMITTED. WHEN WAS YOUR FIRST GIRLFRIEND? WHEN I WAS FIVE. YOU LOOK SO WORRIED, GIRL. I REALLY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF JUST DAD AND BEAU BEING OUT THERE, YOU KNOW? THAT'S WHAT DADDIES ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. THAT JUST MEANS HE LOVES YOU. YEAH... MY MOMMA DIDN'T LIKE PHIL AT ALL. SHE REALLY DIDN'T. YEAH. SHE JUST KEPT TELLING ME HOW MUCH BETTER I COULD DO. HOW IS THAT HELPING? WHAT COULD YOUR DAD DO? I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. NO, THINK ABOUT IT. THAT'S THE THING. WHAT CAN MY DAD DO? THERE THEY ARE. HEY. MISS SADIE, HOW YOU DOING? HEY, GOOD. SMELLS GOOD. NOW SADIE, WILL YOU LOOK AT THIS? I WAS FIXING TO MAKE ME SOME TEA, BUT SEE? YOUR MAMAW HAD ME A GLASS FIXED. I KNOW HIS MIND BETTER THAN HE KNOWS HIS MIND. SO WHEN YOU START DATING IN ABOUT TEN YEARS, YOU'LL WANT TO GET YOUR MAN SOME... OH, PHIL! SHE'S ALREADY DATING, PHIL. NO. BEING YOUTHFUL IS DANGEROUS WHEN IT COME TO LOVE. THEY'RE YOUNG AND THEY'RE MOVING TOO RAPIDLY. HOW OLD'S THAT GIRL? SHE'S 14. 14? NOW YOU KNOW WHY WILLIE'S A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS. HE AIN'T THE ONLY ONE NERVOUS. WHAT'S THIS GUY'S NAME? BEAU. BEAU? I'VE LOOKED AT ENOUGH MEN ON THIS PLANET TO KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR FAITH IN THEM FOR SURE, AT ALL. BREED ANYTHING THAT WALKS. WILL LIE, STEAL. "I LOVE YOU, LET ME GET IN YOUR BRITCHES." SINCE WILLIE IS WITH BEAU... YEAH. ME AND OLD SI WILL TAKE SADIE TO GO WITH US LOG HUNTING, AND WE'LL GIVE HER A LITTLE SPEECH. WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THE PITFALLS OF DATING. YOU NEED TO COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS, SADIE, THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE UNCLE SI IN THE BACKSEAT OF ALL OUR DATES WE WENT ON. HE HAD TO GO WITH US. LOOK HERE, HEY, I WASN'T THAT BAD. MAMA MADE HIM TAKE ME ALONG. YOU KNOW, THEY LOVED HAVING ME AROUND. HEY, I'D TURN MY HEAD AND SING A LOVE SONG FOR 'EM. YOU LEAVE THE CELL PHONE RIGHT WHERE IT IS. WE FIXING TO GET HER LINED OUT ON OLD BEAU, YOU KNOW? OH, NO, POOR SADIE. WELL, WE'RE HERE. TODAY, BEAU, WE'RE HUNTING AN INFESTATION OF SNAKES IN OUR DUCK BLIND. MOST PEOPLE JUST WORRY ABOUT THE BIG ONES. IT'S THE LITTLE ONES THAT'LL GET YOU. THE YOUNG ONES. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SCARE HIM FOR? HE JUST GOES INTO FULL ASSAULT. I'M SURE HE'S SCARED OF POISONOUS SNAKES. LOSE HIS WHOLE HAND, LOSE A FINGER. IT'S AMAZING THAT SUCH A SMALL GUY COULD BE SUCH A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT. MESSING WITH A POISONOUS SNAKE, YOU GOTTA WATCH EVERY STEP YOU MAKE, 'CAUSE THE MINUTE YOU MAKE A... EASY. WHAT YOU GOT? DON'T MOVE. THERE'S A THIN LINE BETWEEN INSANITY AND COPING WITH YOUR DAUGHTER DATING. YOU GOT HIM. YOU GOT HIM FIRST SHOT. WILLIE IS AS WOUND UP AS A COON DOG TRYING TO PASS A PEACH SEED. WHEN YOU SEE THOSE DOGS THAT HAVE THAT, ALL THEIR MUSCLES ARE CONTRACTED AND THEY JUST WALK AROUND ON THEIR TIP-TOES ALL DAY. IT'S QUITE THE SHOW. SEE, SON? YOU GOTTA WATCH EVERY STEP YOU TAKE. THIS IS AWKWARD. YOU COULD CUT THE TENSION WITH A KNIFE. WHAT KIND OF DANCING WE DOING AT THIS DANCE? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? A DANCE IS THE SAME KIND OF DANCE YOU WERE AT. THERE GONNA BE SLOW-DANCING THERE? OF COURSE THERE'S SLOW-DANCING! THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING A DANCE. SOMETIMES THEY DON'T SLOW-DANCE. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? IT'S MY JOB TO LIGHTEN THE MOOD. THIS IS NOT A FUNERAL... YET. IT'S MORE LIKE HUGGING AND THEY'RE JUST MOVING LIKE TWO ZOMBIES. THAT'S THE EASIEST DANCE. DANCING AND YOU'RE HUGGING AND IT LEADS TO KISSING AND MAKING OUT. THAT'S WHY YOU GOTTA TELL HIM, HANDS ON THE HANDS, LIPS ON THE LIPS. WHAT KIND OF ADVICE IS THAT? EVERYTHING ELSE, WAIT TILL YOU GET MARRIED. HEY, LOVE GURU, I GET TO MAKE THE GUIDELINES. IT'S MY DAUGHTER. GIVE HIM FIRST BASE. WHEN YOU TRY TO TAKE FIRST BASE AWAY, THAT'S IT. THEY GO TO ANOTHER BALLPARK. WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT? I'M JUST ASKING! YOU TELLING HIM TO GO LIPS ON THE LIPS. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO. THAT'S WHAT YOU DID! GIVE ME MY HAT. UH-HUH. DON'T MESS WITH ANOTHER MAN'S HAT, ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S GOT A LOADED GUN. I GOT A LOADED WEAPON TOO. GIVE ME MY HAT, WILL. ALL RIGHT, I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU IN ONE SECOND. AW, SHUCKS! I HOPE HIS HAT STAYS UP THERE. I HOPE A SQUIRREL BUILDS A NEST IN IT... GO GET IT. WHAT ARE YOU, TEN? AND TAKES A DUMP IN IT. IF I WAS YOU, I WOULD BREAK UP WITH HER RIGHT NOW JUST SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS IDIOT. YOU'RE STUPID, WILLIE. GIVE ME MY HAT, WILL. ALL RIGHT, I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU IN ONE SECOND. AW, SHUCKS! TODAY REALLY HASN'T GONE ACCORDING TO PLAN. I'M TRYING TO BE INTIMIDATING. GO GET IT. I'VE GOT THIS KID RIGHT WHERE I WANT HIM, BUT I HAVE MADE A TACTICAL MISTAKE. IF I WAS YOU, I WOULD BREAK UP WITH HER RIGHT NOW JUST SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS IDIOT. BRINGING JASE. OH, MY GOODNESS. WHERE I COME FROM, YOU DON'T MESS WITH ANOTHER MAN'S WOMAN OR HIS HAT. I DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF STRESS YOU'RE UNDER, DON'T TOUCH MY HAT! WILLIE, YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A SPAZ. WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP? HERE WE GO. WHEN OLD BEAU DECIDED TO START DATING YOU, HE'S ENTERED THE ROBERTSON ZONE. OH, YEAH, YEP. WE ARE GOING TO EXAMINE HIM... YEP. INVESTIGATE HIM... OH, YEAH. AND ANALYZE HIM. AND THEN FIND OUT ABOUT HIM. I FEEL FOR OLD WILL. YOU GOT A FULL-TIME JOB ON YOUR HANDS KEEPING THESE BOYS AWAY. IT'S LIKE HONEY. THEY DRAW 'EM. WHAT KIND OF GRADES DOES HE MAKE? "A"s AND "B"s. WELL, HE'S SMARTER THAN ME AND OLD SI THERE. YEP. ON MY OWN DAUGHTER'S FIRST DATE, I WENT WITH 'EM. HE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE, 'CAUSE, HEY, THE ALL-SEEING EYES OF ME WAS ON HIM THE WHOLE TIME. WOULD YOU CONCLUDE THAT HE'S A GODLY MAN? DEFINITELY. IS HE A HUNTER? DUCK HUNTER, YEAH. WELL, GOOD NIGHT. HE'S THE QUARTERBACK. THE QUARTERBACK? YES, SIR. OLD BEAU'S SOUNDING BETTER ALL THE TIME. PRETTY IMPRESSIVE YOUNG BUCK. GOT A GOOD HEAD ON HIM. HE'S A GODLY MAN. THAT'S A GOOD THING AS FAR AS OLD BEAU IS CONCERNED. IT'S TIME TO GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINT. SO HOW LONG DID YOU WAIT BEFORE YOU LET HIM KISS YOU? IT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION. HOW LONG DID YOU WAIT TILL YOU LET HIM KISS YOU? I DIDN'T WAIT TOO LONG. NO. HOW LONG DID YOU WAIT TO KISS MISS KAY? I WASN'T MUCH OF A KISSER, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? SO LOOK, BEAU, IS THERE KISSES GOING ON AT THESE DANCES, OR... I'M NOT SURE. WELL, YOU BETTER GET SURE. THEY'RE GONNA KISS, THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. JASE IS BEING AN IDIOT. I'M TRYING TO PROTECT MY DAUGHTER FROM THIS LITTLE PIPSQUEAK SHE'S DATING, AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT KISSING HER ON THE LIPS, AND I DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY. TAKE HER FEELINGS INTO ACCOUNT. YES, SIR. I WANT TO PUT A BALLOON IN BETWEEN THEM WHILE THEY'RE DANCING. I TAKE THAT BACK. FOUR BALLOONS. BE RESPECTFUL. THERE'S A SNAKE RIGHT THERE. WHOA. WHOA! EASY. SHOOT HIM! WOW. OH, MY GOODNESS. PICK UP THE PIECES. NO, YOU GOT HIM. AIN'T NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. LOOK... THAT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT. THERE'S HALF OF IT. HALF? THAT'S, LIKE, 10%. GOOD SHOT, BEAU. I LIKE THAT. I'M STILL NOT OKAY WITH THIS WHOLE THING, BUT I WILL HAVE TO GIVE IT TO THE KID. HE'S A GOOD SHOT. WHAT DO I THINK ABOUT BEAU? LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. GOOD SHOT, SON. I SAW PIECES GO IN EVERY DIRECTION. WE HAD A GOOD HUNT OUT THERE. OH, MAN! DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME, BEAU? YES, MA'AM, HAD A GREAT TIME. HE HANDLED HIMSELF WELL. GOOD. I MEAN, THE KID'S ALL RIGHT, BUT LET'S DON'T GET TOO CARRIED AWAY. HEY, HE'S MR. SHOTGUN MAN RIGHT HERE. I THINK JASE HAS A MAN-CRUSH ON BEAU. THERE SHE IS. HEY, Y'ALL. SADIE! THE LADY OF THE HOUR. HEY. HOW'D IT GO? BEAU KILLED HIM A SNAKE. GOOD. OLD BEAU'S ALL RIGHT, I'M TELLING YOU. GOOD, IS HE INVITED BACK, WILLIE? YEP, HE CAN COME BACK. PRETTY GOOD WITH A SHOTGUN. HE'S A SNAKE GUNNER. HEY, THAT'S A NOBLE QUALITY IN THIS WORLD. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. I'LL ADMIT, BEAU DOES KNOW HIS GUNS, AND I AM A LITTLE IMPRESSED, BUT I'M NOT TELLING HIM I'M IMPRESSED. I LIKE THAT BOY. I DO TOO. HE AIN'T BAD. LOOK, WHEN THEY TURN OL' LIONEL RICHIE ON AT THE DANCE, THEY GONNA START SLOW-DANCING, GET UP ALL NICE AND CLOSE, SWAP SOME SPIT. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OFF RUNNING, AND I'LL GIVE YOU TWO SECONDS BEFORE I START SHOOTING AT YOU? YOU SHOOT AT ME, YOU BETTER NOT MISS. AH, HERE SHE COMES! WHOO-OOH! HEY, HEY, HEY. LOOKIE HERE, LOOKIE HERE, LOOKIE HERE. SADIE LOOKS GORGEOUS. TOO GORGEOUS. THAT BEAU BETTER BEHAVE. HEY. HEY. HOW'S IT GOING, BUDDY? YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, SIR. GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN. HEY. HOW ARE YOU? EASY, EASY. BEAU LOOKS GREAT. HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S STILL SCARED. BYE, MOM. BEAU, I GOT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING HERE. UH-OH. YOU'RE A PRETTY GOOD SHOT. HERE'S YOU A DUCK CALL. THAT'S AWESOME. THANK YOU, MR. WILLIE. I CAN'T ADMIT THAT I LIKE THIS KID... HE'S DATING MY DAUGHTER... BUT I KINDA LIKE HIM. MAYBE YOU'LL GET TO GO OUT THERE WITH US AND HUNT ONE DAY. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. JUST MAKE SURE YOUR LIPS ARE ONLY ON THAT, ALL RIGHT? YES, SIR. YOU GOT THAT? DAD! ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST PICKING. NOT REALLY. SERIOUSLY. OH, GOSH. WILLIE. IF HIS LIPS ARE GONNA BE ON SOMETHING I MADE, I'D RATHER IT BE A DUCK CALL. FATHER, WE'RE SO THANKFUL FOR THIS DAY. THANK YOU FOR THE MANY, MANY BLESSINGS THAT YOU GIVE US. WE JUST PRAY FOR SADIE AND BEAU AND THEIR YOUNG RELATIONSHIP. AMEN. All: AMEN. AS A FATHER, NOTHING MAKES ME HAPPIER THAN SEEING A SMILE ON MY DAUGHTER'S FACE AND FEAR IN HER BOYFRIEND'S EYES. IT'S NOT EASY BEING A GOOD PARENT. YOU WANT TO STAY INVOLVED IN THEIR LIVES, BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO SMOTHER 'EM. IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE, LIKE SI'S SANITY. IN THE END, I JUST WANT MY DAUGHTER TO FIND A GOOD MAN SHE CAN GROW OLD WITH, LIKE PHIL AND KAY. I JUST HOPE SHE ISN'T PLANNING ON GETTING MARRIED AT 16. HEY, WILLIE, WHAT DO YOU THINK BEAU AND SADIE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW? HEY, JASE, WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP?
