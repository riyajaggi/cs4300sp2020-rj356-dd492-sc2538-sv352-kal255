IT'S THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY PARTY. OH, YEAH. WE'RE GONNA BREAK THE GUINNESS WORLD RECORD, THE BIGGEST DUCK CALL EVER. THERE'S A RECORD FOR THAT? YES. I WANNA BUILD THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DUCK CALL BECAUSE DUCK COMMANDER IS THE BIGGEST AND THE BEST. THE RECORD RIGHT NOW IS 36 INCHES. THREE FOOT LONG? Y'ALL NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BUILD THIS THING. WILLIE, YOU'RE WANTING US TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND IN A FEW DAYS? EXACTLY. WILLIE, THIS IS NOT GONNA BE EASY, IT'S GONNA BE... HEY, NOTHING THAT'S EVER BIG IS EASY. WILLIE THINKS IF SOMETHING'S BIGGER, IT MUST BE BETTER. I DON'T. I NEVER JUDGE A MAN'S PROWESS BY THE SIZE OF HIS DUCK CALL. I DON'T CARE HOW BIG IT IS. ALL RIGHT, GET IT, DESIGN IT. THE CEO HAS SPOKEN. WHERE DOES HE COME UP WITH THIS STUFF? GOTTA BE BIGGER THAN 36 INCHES. COOL. SHOW IT AT THE PARTY. I LIKE THAT. THIS WEEKEND? THIS WEEKEND. I WANT THE PRESS HERE... IF WE PUT IN THE PRESS, THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT. WE'RE GONNA DO IT. KORIE JUST NEEDS TO CALM DOWN AND HAVE A LITTLE FAITH IN ME. IT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE DUCK CALLS EVERY DAY. YOU GOTTA DO IT. YOU GOTTA DELIVER. YOU LOOK GOOD TODAY. WILLIE. SI, WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU BEEN HOUSE SHOPPING? IT'S BEEN A WHILE. MISS KAY STARTS CHIRPING ABOUT LET'S GO LOOK AT A HOUSE. I THINK IT'LL JUST BE FUN TO LOOK. JUST TO GET IT BEHIND ME, I SAID I'LL GO LOOK. WHEN YOU GET TO TOWN, SI, LOOK AT THIS. BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC, WE GOT BLINKING LIGHTS, THE LAW'S PULLING PEOPLE OVER, SI. UPTOWN LIVING, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO CALL 911. WHERE I LIVE, I AM 911. WELL I'M EXCITED AND YOU BETTER BEHAVE AND NOT ACT LIKE A COUNTRY BUMPKIN. LOOK AT THIS CAT HERE, PHIL. HE'S RUBBING HIS HANDS TOGETHER. GOOD MORNING. WHEN A MAN GOES RUBBING HIS HANDS TOGETHER WHEN HE LOOKS AT ME, I'M THINKING, "UH-OH". YOU MUST BE PHIL. I'M WHAT'S LEFT OF HIM. MY NAME'S GREG KNEAD. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. WHEN I SAW GREG KNEAD, I JUST REACHED AROUND AND I FELT MY BACK POCKET TO MAKE SURE MY BILLFOLD WAS THERE. I ALWAYS TRUST A REAL ESTATE MAN ALONG WITH THE LAWYERS AND DOCTORS. HE'S NOT GONNA SLICK ME WITH THAT FAST-TALKING VACUUM CLEANER TALK. NO, SIR. YOU GOT A SPIT CUP IN YOUR RIG? NO... I DON'T. IF YOU'RE GONNA SELL HOUSES YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA PROVIDE THESE THINGS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? NO SPIT CUPS. I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE A LONG DAY RIGHT THEN. THIS REEKS OF A SUBDIVISION, GREG KNEAD. NO, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BEAUTIFUL PRIME REAL ESTATE. IS IT BIG? DO YOU LIKE BIG? I LIKE BIG. IT'S BIG. OH, MY. WELCOME TO YOUR NEW WORLD. THIS MAY BE A LITTLE MUCH. IT HAS A VATICAN LOOK ABOUT IT. DOES THE POPE COME WITH IT? BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS IS STRANGELY AFFORDABLE. "STRANGELY AFFORDABLE." WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? OLD GREG "KNEAL," NOW HE'S A SALESMAN. HE HAS DOLLAR SIGNS IN HIS EYES. WHEN GREG KNEAD TAKES A FIRST SHOT, HE MAKES IT A GOOD ONE. WHOA. WHAT I'M PROPOSING IS FOUR AND A HALF FEET. FORGET 36 INCHES. IF WE MAKE IT 37, SOMEBODY'LL COME BACK AND MAKE IT 38. YOU WANT A DUCK CALL? I'LL GIVE YOU A DUCK CALL. FOR GIANTS. THAT'S A BIG CALL. REALLY BIG. WE'RE GONNA NEED SOMEBODY WITH A BIG MOUTH. AND THAT'S WHERE THE CEO COMES IN. OH... ALL RIGHT, I JUST GOT THE GUIDELINES BACK FROM GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS. IT'S GOTTA EMULATE THE SOUND OF A DUCK. IT'S GOTTA BE WITNESSED BY A PROFESSIONAL DUCK CALLER, HAVE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE. WE GOT THE NEWS COMING. WE'LL TAKE PICTURES, SO THIS IS DOABLE. THIS SHOULD BE EASY. WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A DUCK CALL JUST A LITTLE BIT BIGGER. WILLIE HAS NO CONCEPT OF WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A DUCK CALL. IF SOMEBODY SAYS, "WILLIE, YOU KNOW, YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON MAKING A DUCK CALL." HE'D POINT AT ME AND SAY, "I NEED ONE IN A HURRY." LET'S DO IT. LET'S GO GET SOME WOOD. Y'ALL GET THE REED. WE CAN HANDLE THAT. YOU GOTTA HAVE SOMEBODY WITH A BIG MOUTH TO BLOW IT. SO I THINK YOU MIGHT QUALIFY. THESE TREES ARE LITTLE. JASE AND I ARE OUT IN THE CYPRESS CREEK TO GATHER WOOD FOR THE WORLD'S LARGEST DUCK CALL. BRACE YOURSELF. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DRIVE THIS THING... OW! SORRY, I MISSED MY TURN. JASE IS ACTING LIKE HE'S BLIND. I MEAN, YOU NEED TO PUT LITTLE BRAILLE SIGNS UP ON EVERY TREE SO HE CAN MANEUVER AROUND THEM. STOP DOING THAT. HEY, THIS IS PART OF IT. THAT'S CALLED REDNECK GEOMETRY. IT'S STRATEGIC PINBALL. AND I'VE GOT THE JOYSTICK. OW! OH! NOT SO FAST! DUDE. WHAT, DID HE DRINK A 12 PACK BEFORE HE CAME OUT TODAY? THIS ONE'S PERFECT. I'M IN. WHOA, WHOA. I'M IN A HOLE, SON. MAYBE AN ALLIGATOR HOLE. I GOT NOT... DON'T EVEN SAY THAT. DUDE, LOOK AT ALL THE BUBBLES. I'M TELLING YOU, AN ALLIGATOR HOLE. NO, IT REALLY WASN'T AN ALLIGATOR HOLE, BUT HE DON'T NEED TO KNOW THAT. DON'T MOVE, DON'T MOVE, DON'T MOVE. OUT HERE IN THE WOODS, THIS IS MY DOMAIN. HEY, THERE'S A SNAKE RIGHT THERE. AAH! SO ANY CHANCE I GET TO KIND OF POKE AT WILLIE A LITTLE BIT, I DO IT. IT GIVES ME A CERTAIN BIT OF AMUSEMENT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. SLOW DOWN. WHOOPS, OH! OH, I HIT THAT ONE HEAD ON. OH, MY. THIS IS A CASTLE. IS THIS GREAT? THAT'S ONE WORD FOR IT. UNBELIEVABLE. WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I DOING STANDING HERE, TALKING TO THIS CAT? ♪ LET'S ALL HURRY ♪ ♪ DOWN THE RIVER ♪ SING ALONG. I'M THINKING INSTEAD OF REAL ESTATE, THIS IS A REAL MISTAKE. HERE'S YOUR DINING ROOM. WHEN YOU HAVE A PARTY. I DON'T DO PARTIES. THAT LITTLE CHANDELIER, $25,000. DUMB. THIS IS PART OF YOUR SPA AREA. THAT WOULD BE NICE WHEN WE BAPTIZE PEOPLE IN THE WINTER. OKAY. SIX KITCHENS, TWELVE BEDROOMS, A POOL, MARBLE EVERYTHING. PHIL, YOU DESERVE IT. YEAH. EAT, SLEEP AND MESS WITH MISS KAY A LITTLE BIT IN BACK IN THE BACK ROOM IS ABOUT ALL I'M GETTING OUT OF A HOUSE. OH, I CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT RIGHT WHERE I AM. NO PROBLEM. I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE BEYOND WHAT WE HAD IN MIND. MM-HMM. SO... SO LET'S GO SEE ANOTHER HOUSE. GREG KNEAD IS HERE FOR YOU. DUDE, YOU'RE LIKE ARNOLD IN COMMANDO. SO WE'RE LOOKING GOOD. WE'VE GOT OUR WOOD. WE'VE GOT THE CREW. EVERYTHING IS ON SCHEDULE. IT'S GOT A PRETTY GOOD ODOR ABOUT IT TOO. YOU KNOW WHAT IT SMELLS LIKE TO ME? WHAT? HISTORY. ALL RIGHT, BOYS. THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DUCK CALL IS WELL UNDERWAY. OH, YES. OH, COME ON! COME ON. WELL IF IT HAD BEEN EASY, IT WOULDN'T BE A RECORD. YES, SIR. WHEE. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF A DUCK CALL IS THE REED. IT'S GOTTA BE PERFECT. I LIKE IT! YOU GOTTA HAVE THE SOUNDS OF DUCKS ENTRENCHED IN YOUR BRAIN. YOU COMBINE THAT WITH AERODYNAMICS AND A LOT OF TRIAL AND ERROR. SEE HOW IT FLUFFLES? I'M NOT SURE IT'S GONNA MAKE A RACKET. WE NEED MORE AIR. WE JUST BUILT THE WORLD'S BIGGEST FART MACHINE. HEY, YOU NEED TO CHECK THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS FOR THAT. THERE'S A THIN LINE BETWEEN A MALLARD HEN'S QUACK AND A HUMAN'S FART. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS CADENCE AND ODOR. WE GOTTA MAKE THAT THING VIBRATE. WE'RE CLOSE. WE ARE ON THE DOORSTEPS OF HISTORY BEING MADE. LEAVE IT OUT. WE'LL COME BACK TOMORROW. I SEE SOME MANSIONS BACK THERE TOO. WHOO, THAT ONE OF 'EM LOOKS LIKE A CASTLE. LOOKS LIKE A WHAT? CASTLE. I THOUGHT YOU SAID HOLE. MISS KAY. HERE'S YOUR HOME. 3,400 SQUARE FEET, THREE BATHROOM, TWO BEDROOM. A BEAUTIFUL SWIMMING POOL. THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF LAND FOR YOU. IT'S A GOLF COURSE. YES. A WHAT? THIS WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE WAY TO TORTURE PHIL ROBERTSON. BUY A HOUSE ON A GOLF COURSE. IF HE STEPS OUT ON HIS PORCH, HE CAN'T SHOOT SOMETHING. YOU TALK ABOUT PUTTING MISERY ON A MAN. GREG, LOOK HERE. THIS THING FUNCTIONAL? OH, YES. BECAUSE I NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM. FOR A MAN THAT TRAVELS EVERYWHERE HE GOES WITH A GALLON OF ICE TEA AND A GLASS... WHERE'S THE BATHROOM AT? THERE IT IS, RIGHT THERE. HEY, I'VE GOT TO MAKE A LOT OF PIT STOPS. MATTER OF FACT, I'M GONNA RUN... I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN LIE AROUND AND YOU CAN HAVE YOUR ICE TEA, SI. OH, I'LL ALWAYS HAVE MY ICE TEA. THIS IS OVER 5,000 ACRES. THERE'S ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT, GREG. SOMEBODY OWNS THAT 5,000 ACRES. AND THEY PUT A GOLF COURSE ON IT. YEP. YEP. YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LEAK IN YOUR YARD WITHOUT ANYBODY SAYING, "WHAT'S HE DOING?" THINK ABOUT THAT. WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN TAKE A LEAK IN YOUR YARD. LOOK HERE. WHAT'S THIS HERE, THE OUTHOUSE? NO, THAT'S WHERE ALL THE SUPPLIES ARE. THAT'S A SUPPLY HOUSE. A SURPRISE HOUSE? SUPPLY. SUPPLY. WHAT IS THIS HERE? A MINNOW POND? A MENOPAUSE? A MINNOW POND. I'M TIRED OF BEING DRAGGED AROUND BY GREG KNEAD. PHIL, THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE GONNA PUT YOU BOAR. YEAH. KNEAD KEEPS TELLING ME HOW GREAT THE HOUSE IS. IMAGINE. BOOM! WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT'S ALL A RUSE.

AS CEO OF DUCK COMMANDER, I MAY GET IN A LITTLE OVER MY HEAD SOMETIMES. BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN MY FAMILY. 40 YEARS DIDN'T HAPPEN BY CHANCE, AND EVEN THOUGH WE'VE BEEN BLESSED WITH SUCCESS, PHIL, KAY AND US BOYS ARE STILL THE SAME PEOPLE WE WERE WHEN WE WERE LIVING IN THAT OLD HOUSE. NO MATTER HOW BIG THINGS GET, AND THINGS CAN GET REAL BIG AROUND HERE, IT'S NEVER CHANGED WHO WE ARE. I STILL THINK WE SHOULD HAVE BLOWN SOMETHING TO SMITHEREENS, JACK.
