 A LITTLE BIT. IT CAN'T JUST BE A BLAND STORY. HEY, THAT BABY WOLVERINE GROWS UP AND DECLARES WAR ON THIS SUCKER. SOME OF SI'S STORIES YOU COULD LABEL AS "SI-ENCE" FICTION. THE SCARY PART IS, I THINK SI BELIEVES THEM. HE COMES IN AND JUST RANSACKS HIS CABIN. HE JUST PISSES ON EVERYTHING IN THE CABIN. THAT'S "SI-FI" ALL THE WAY. THAT'S THE TRUTH. ALL OF MY STORIES, THEY'RE 95% TRUTHFUL. NO WAY. WOLVES CHASING HIM, BURNING HIS SHOES UP.

ALL RIGHT, CHILDREN, WE HAVE OUR NEXT VISITOR FOR CAREER DAY. THIS IS SI ROBERTSON, AND WE'RE SO EXCITED TO HAVE HIM HERE. WANT YOU TO PUT YOUR LISTENING EARS ON, AND GIVE HIM A HAND. I'M FIXIN' TO TEACH THESE KIDS THAT, HEY, SOMEBODY PAID THE PRICE FOR THEIR FREEDOM. HAVE Y'ALL EVER HEARD OF THE TERM "'NAM"? THERE WAS A WAR IN VIETNAM THAT WE WAS INVOLVED IN. THE AMERICANS AND THE VIETNAMESE. OKAY? DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED? SEE, Y'ALL THINK THE FRIED CHICKEN PLACES WILL ALWAYS BE THERE. YOU JUST PULL UP AND SAY, "HEY, GIVE ME A MCDONALD'S." WHAT IF THERE ARE NO MCDONALD'S? YOU CAN SURVIVE AND EAT PRETTY GOOD. THIS IS FOOD. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO PREPARE IT. BOY, THIS DUCK BE FAT. I WONDER WHY HE'S SO FAT. I WANT YOU TO LOOK HOW BIG THIS IS. LO AND BEHOLD, LOOK WHAT'S IN HIS CRAW. IT'S AN ACORN. YOU SURE YOU AIN'T BEEN PRACTICIN'? I BEEN PRACTICIN' IN MY MIND. OH, MY GOODNESS. AWW! OH, CRAP. BOOM! THANK YOU. WILLIE'S MONEY IS SWEETER THAN ANY OTHER MONEY I KNOW OF. WHOO! WHOO! HAS A CERTAIN AROMA TO IT. AGH! OH! NAH, IT'S... IT'S GONE. WHOA, THERE'S A LOT OF FROGS SWIMMING AROUND YOUR BALL, WILLIE. I HAVE FOUND THE FROG HEAVEN. WHEN YOU HAVE EATEN AS MANY FROGS AS I HAVE, ALL YOU WANNA DO IS JUST EAT MORE OF 'EM. THERE'S VERY FEW THINGS THAT TURN ME ON... IN LIFE. THAT TURNS ME ON. NOW, WATCH. SEE RIGHT HERE? SO THERE GOES HIS WING. THE DUCK'S HEAD HAS NOW BEEN REMOVED. OOH, A LITTLE BLOODY. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THEY CAN LEARN FROM AN OLD GUY LIKE ME THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. HOW DO YOU CATCH SOMETHING IN THE WOODS AND EAT IT? THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT. I'M GONNA PUSH DOWN WITH THIS FINGER. AND I'M GRABBING UP IN THERE, AND ONE, TWO, THREE... OH, GOSH. THAT CONCLUDES MY LITTLE SESSION WITH YOU, KIDS. IT WAS... IT WAS A... WHAT CAN I SAY? IT WAS AWESOME. PEOPLE GOT SHOT UP. THE MEDIC WAS RUNNING AROUND, FIXING THEM ALL UP. PROPPED THIS GUY AGAINST A TREE. HE HAD A SHOULDER WOUND. STOPPED THE BLEEDING. THERE'S A BENGAL TIGER, GRABBED THIS GUY HE JUST BANDAGED, DRAGGIN' HIM OFF. THEY GOTTA KILL THE TIGER, AND THERE AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT BLOOD SPRAYIN' EVERYWHERE. UH, I THINK THAT'LL BE JUST FINE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. GOOD DAY. YOU'RE WELCOME. I DON'T THINK IT COULD HAVE GONE ANY BETTER. SOME OF THEM MAY WAKE UP AT NIGHT, YOU KNOW, WITH NIGHTMARES OVER IT. BUT THAT MAY NOT BE A BAD THING. I DON'T REMEMBER HAVING NO CAREER DAY AT... WHERE WE WAS AT IN HIGH SCHOOL. WE WAS TOO BUSY WORKING. I WOULD SAY CAREER DAY WAS A ROARING SUCCESS. WE TAUGHT 'EM ABOUT LIFE. WE TAUGHT 'EM ABOUT DEATH. WE TAUGHT 'EM ABOUT FOOD. GREAT JOB. HEY. THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA, KORIE. YEAH, THIS IS REALLY NICE. OH, OUCH. OH, THAT JUST HURTS. I'VE GOT TENDER TOES, APPARENTLY. I TOLD JASE HE NEEDS TO COME AND GET ONE DONE ONE TIME. DO YOU THINK HE'D ACTUALLY DO IT? YEAH, JUST WOULDN'T TELL ANYBODY. WE SHOULD GET PHILIP HERE. YOU'D HAVE TO PAY EXTRA. I WOULD FEEL SORRY FOR THE PERSON WORKING ON PHIL. THAT'S THE NASTIEST FEET I'VE EVER SEEN. YEAH. HELLO? YEAH, HEY, I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? WHAT? WAIT, WHERE WAS WILLIE? WAS WILLIE THERE? WILLIE DIDN'T GO TO CAREER DAY. WHEN YOU'VE GOT A DUCK, THERE IS BLOODSHED. OH, NO. BUT PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY DO THAT IN THE CLASSROOM. IN THE CLASSROOM? I REMOVED THE GIZZARD FROM THE INTESTINES, AND THAT'S WHEN MOST OF THE LITTLE GIRLS BEGAN TO SQUEAL. PHIL, WE'RE NOT IN THE PIONEER DAYS. I THINK THERE'S A WHOLE LOT WORSE THINGS GOING ON IN THIS WORLD THAN PICKING A DUCK AND DRESSING HIM. MAYBE IT'S JUST ME. HEY, WE WAS TRYING TO ENLIGHTEN THESE CITY SLICKERS. WHAT DID YOU DO, SI? I TOLD THEM ABOUT VIETNAM. YOU TOLD FOURTH GRADERS ABOUT VIETNAM? ABOUT THE WAR, YEAH. THESE ARE THE GUYS YOU NEED TO TALK TO ABOUT THAT. WHAT'S WRONG WITH Y'ALL? KORIE'S GOT TWO LOOKS. NORMALLY HAPPY... AND THEN ANGRY. AND, BELIEVE ME, WHEN SHE'S ANGRY, IT'S ALL OVER HER FACE. DIDN'T YOU HAVE A PRIOR OBLIGATION TODAY? MM-MMM. I... WE... I SUBBED THAT OUT. THAT WASN'T SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST SUB OUT. I TOOK CARE OF IT. YOU TOOK CARE BY SENDING YOUR DAD AND UNCLE. EXACTLY. AND THEY TALKED ABOUT VIETNAM AND CUT OFF DUCK'S HEADS. IN FRONT OF EIGHTH-GRADE GIRLS. Y'ALL WERE SUPPOSED TO GO TALK ABOUT OUR CAREER. WE DONE WHAT WE WAS TOLD. DON'T... HEY, DON'T BLAME US. I DON'T KNOW WHY KORIE'S SO MAD ANYWAY. IT'S NOT LIKE I SENT TWO CREEPY, STRANGE MEN DOWN TO SCHOOL. I REMOVED THE GIZZARD FROM THE INTESTINES AND SAID, "THIS WOULD BE A GIZZARD." WELL, HEY. YOU KNOW. OKAY... SHE DOES HAVE A POINT. BUT THEY'RE STILL FAMILY. WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE GONNA DO YOUR CHILD'S CAREER DAY, YOU SHOULD BE THERE. YOU SHOULDN'T JUST PAWN IT OFF TO SOMEBODY ELSE. Y'ALL SHUCKED YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO IT. I JUST THOUGHT IT NEEDED TO GET DONE. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. TWO GROWN MEN MADE A BAD... WELL, THEY'RE GONE. WELL... WELL... HMM. I KNEW WE SHOULD'VE GONE DUCK HUNTING. YOU STILL MAD? I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THAT. I REALLY CANNOT BELIEVE IT. I SENT REPLACEMENTS. YOU MADE A COMMITMENT TO YOUR KIDS. THEY WERE EXPECTING THEIR DADDY. NOBODY CAN REPLACE THAT. AND YOU JUST BLEW IT OFF FOR GOLF. YOU GET AROUND YOUR BROTHERS AND Y'ALL JUST START GOOFIN' OFF. YOU ACT LIKE THE ROBERTSON MEN CAN JUST GO DO ANYTHING. HEY, WE DO A LOT OF WORK. YOU WANNA BUILD DUCK CALLS? I... I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT... GET BACK THERE AND DO IT. YOU GO DO IT. I'M TALKING ABOUT SHOWING UP FOR YOUR COMMITMENTS. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TAKE KORIE SERIOUSLY WHEN SHE'S MAD, BECAUSE I THINK SHE'S CUTE WHEN SHE'S MAD. SHE'S ALL MAD AND ACTING LIKE, "I'M MAD." IT'S FUNNY. EVERY TIME YOU GET AROUND JASE, YOU START ACTING JUST LIKE HIM... IMMATURE AND IRRESPONSIBLE. HA! JASE ISN'T IRRESPONSIBLE. I CAN'T SEE NOTHIN'. AND THIS IS THE HOLE I'M TELLING YOU ABOUT. SINCE PLAYING GOLF, THE FROGS HAVE NEVER LEFT MY MIND. WHEN YOU RUN UP ON A FROG HAVEN OF THIS MAGNITUDE, OH, YOU'LL SEE THAT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. OVER HERE? I HIT THE GOLF BALL IN HERE, AND WHEN I LOOKED AROUND, I SAID, "OH, MY GOODNESS. THIS IS THE FROG PROMISED LAND." THESE FROGS HAVE NO IDEA. GOOD NIGHT. I HAVE ASSEMBLED THE FROG CATCHIN' DREAM TEAM. MY DAD PHIL, MY UNCLE SI, AND OL' BIG JOHNNY GODWIN. WE FIXIN' TO TEAR THEIR TAIL OFF ON THIS ONE. BOYS, WE ARE IN BUSINESS. BINGO. IT'S JUST NOT IN MY NATURE TO MISS. FROG CATCHING IS THE MOST FUN A HUMAN BEING CAN HAVE WHILE ON THE EARTH. LOOK AT THE LEGS ON THAT THING. THAT IS GONNA BE SOME FINE EATIN'. FROGS ARE A DEFINITE DELICACY. SAUTEED UP IN A LITTLE OLIVE OIL AND A LITTLE BUTTER, WITH A LITTLE SEASONING ON THEM. WE'D PRETTY WELL PULL OUT ALL STOPS. THERE AIN'T NOTHING FINER THAN RICH FROG LEGS, TAKEN OFF OF A FINE GOLF COURSE. AIN'T NOTHIN' SWEETER. THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE. YEAH, YOU GOT HIM, JASE. EASY, EASY, SI. HEY, DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING? YEAH. WHAT'S THAT? WHAT WAS IT? I DON'T KNOW. WHEN I SEE BRIGHT LIGHTS COMING AT A DISTANCE AT A PRETTY GOOD SPEED, I'M GONE. WILL YOU TURN THE LIGHT OFF? TURN THE LIGHT OFF. WHAT Y'ALL DOING DOWN HERE? Y'ALL CAN'T BE DOWN HERE. OH, NO. WILLIE, THE POINT IS THIS. NEXT TIME YOU HAVE A COMMITMENT TO OUR KIDS, I'M JUST ASKING THAT YOU DO IT... YOU FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT AND DON'T GO RUNNING OFF WITH YOUR IRRESPONSIBLE BROTHERS. KORIE'S BEEN GRIPING ME OUT FOR TWO HOURS. I MEAN, I FIND THAT, IN THESE SITUATIONS, THE BEST THING TO DO IS START REPAIRING THE DAMAGE. WELL, THAT'S NOT THE WAY I SAW IT, BUT I SEE YOUR POINT. OKAY, THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY IN THIS WHOLE THING. YEAH. OH, MY GOODNESS. ALL RIGHT. WHAT? SOME DAYS JUST REFUSE TO END. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DAYS. I GOTTA GO. IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT SOMEONE WOULD ACTUALLY BE MONITORING, YOU KNOW, A GOLF COURSE AT NIGHT. WELL, THIS IS A NICE FACILITY. YEAH, IT IS. IT'S A VERY NICE FACILITY. I DON'T PANIC WHEN I'M DETAINED. I WANT TO TRY TO CONVERT THIS SECURITY GUARD TO THE WAYS OF FROG CATCHING AND FROG EATING. Y'ALL REALLY EAT THOSE THINGS? OHH! THEY'RE A DELICACY. YOU FRY THAT THING UP, HUH? YOU EAT THE WHOLE THING. HOW MANY OF 'EM ARE DOWN THERE LIKE THAT? OH, IT'S FULL OF 'EM. WAIT, WAIT. THERE HE GOES. OHH. WELL, HE JUST... HE JUST PEED ON ME. YEAH. HOW YOU DOING, SIR? I'M PRETTY SURE THAT NO OTHER MEMBERS HAVE HAD THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS SNEAK ON THE COURSE AND TRY TO TAKE A BUNCH OF FROGS. BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S TYPICAL. IT'S WHAT I'VE COME TO EXPECT. SORRY ABOUT THIS AGAIN. MEN. MIGHT OUGHTA... FROG PEE. MIGHT OUGHTA DO THAT. YEAH. HE PEED ON MY HAND. ALL RIGHT, OFFICER. APPRECIATE IT. WELL, WE GOT OUT OF THAT. "WE" GOT OUT OF THAT? YEAH. HEY, NO HARM, NO FOUL. "WE" DIDN'T DO CRAP. I DROVE UP HERE AND GOT Y'ALL OUT OF THAT. I MEAN, LIGHTEN UP. LIGHTEN UP? YOU COMIN' UP HERE GETTIN' THESE FROGS IS STUPID AND DUMB. AND IF I WASN'T A MEMBER, THEY'D HAVE TAKEN YOU TO JAIL. YOU SHOULD BE LAUGHIN' ABOUT THIS. YOU DON'T REMEMBER ALL THE TIMES WE WOULD GO DOWN TO HARRISON'S POND AND CATCH ALL THE FISH AND THE FROGS? WE WERE 12! YOU'VE LOST YOUR EDGE IS WHAT'S HAPPENED. I'M MATURE NOW! I HAVE A JOB. I HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES. WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE? NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU DONE GOT SOPHISTICATED, AND YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN US. WE HUNT FROGS AND EAT 'EM. ANY OTHER TIME, YOU'D HAVE BEEN RIGHT THERE WITH US, WILL. WILL IS GOING THROUGH AN IDENTITY CRISIS. HE'S DONE FORGOT WHO HE IS. THE BOY'S A ROBERTSON THROUGH AND THROUGH, AND THESE ARE FAT BULLFROGS THAT NEED TO BE PICKED UP AND THEN FRIED UP! I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I SAW THE YELLOW LIGHT COME ON. AND HERE COME THE... A SECURITY GUARD. WHAT ARE THEY GUARDIN'? GOLF BALLS? PHIL WAS WITH US. WHERE IS HE? DON'T WORRY ABOUT PHIL. HE'S BEEN IN THE WOODS ALL HIS LIFE. WHEN SECURITY COMES... EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. IT'S EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. AND THE GOOD POINT IS, HEY, HE HAD ABOUT 40 FROGS IN A SACK. HEY. HEY. 40 FROGS. THESE GUYS ARE LIKE A BUNCH OF IMMATURE CHILDREN. THEY JUST WON'T GROW UP. LET'S GO. HEY, BLAME THIS ON YOUR MAMA. SHE AIN'T HERE! WELL, SHE LOVES BULLFROG LEGS! WHAT CAN WE SAY? OHH, Y'ALL ARE SO STUPID. HEY, BOYS, HEY. THERE'S PHIL, RIGHT UP YONDER. WHAT? THERE HE IS. LOOK AT HIM. PHIL, YOU A LONG WAYS FROM HOME. PHIL CAN NAVIGATE THROUGH ANY WOODS. YOU CAN DROP HIM OFF AND, HEY, HE'LL FIND HIS WAY OUT OF THERE. HE GOT A SIXTH SENSE ABOUT IT, I'M TELLING YOU. COME ON IN HERE. WHEW! I'M GETTIN' TOO OLD FOR THAT. BUT, I MEAN, I'M GLAD YOU HAD THE FROGS. OH, I GOT THE FROGS, BUT GOOD 9/11, BOYS. WHO WAS THAT? SOME KIND OF... THEY HAD A SECURITY GUARD. IT WAS A SECURITY GUARD. HA! HUH? YEAH, I'M IN A BIND OVER IT. WELL, I AIN'T NEVER SEEN SUCH A RUCKUS OVER ONE LITTLE FROG HUMP. WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS, ANYWAY? I GUESS IT WAS MINE. JASE IS LIKE THE THORN IN MY SIDE THAT DOES NOT GO AWAY. IT'S LIKE HIM GETTING ME IN TROUBLE OVER CAREER DAY WASN'T ENOUGH FOR HIM. SOMETIMES, I'M JUST WONDERING IF JASE IS JUST TRYING TO SABOTAGE MY LIFE. WILLIE'S WORRIED ABOUT HIS REPUTATION. HIS REDNECK BLOOD IS THINNING. TOO MANY BOARD MEETINGS. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER? EITHER BE PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE OR SHAVE THAT STUFF OFF YOUR FACE AND BUY YOU A THREE-PIECE SUIT. YOU FORGOT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A REDNECK. YOU THINK I LOST MY REDNECK? YEAH, YOU'RE SLIPPING. HOW 'BOUT THIS? OH, GOLLY! UH-OH. OH, YOU DON'T THINK I'M A REDNECK? I'M FIXIN' TO GO CRAZY REDNECK UP IN HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SPIN THEM TIRES, WILLIE! LET 'ER RIP, BOY! LET 'ER RIP! YEE-HAW! WHOO! YOU AIN'T A REDNECK UNLESS YOU OFF THE ROAD! HE'S BACK, JASE! HE'S BACK! UH-OH. UH-OH. WELL, GET OUT AND TRY TO PUSH IT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. GIVE IT SOME GAS, WILLIE! JUST WHEN I THOUGHT WE HAD LOST WILLIE, THAT LITTLE REDNECK MAN INSIDE OF HIM BURST FORTH. PUSH! IT AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE. IT AIN'T MOVIN'. YOU DRIVE DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND YOU LOOK OUT IN THE FIELD AND YOU SEE A TRUCK OUT THERE, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. LIBERATION. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO IN A CASE LIKE THIS? YOU WALK. DON'T FORGET THE FROGS. I GOT THE FROGS. WHERE YOU GOIN'? IT AIN'T GONNA COME OUT, YOU REDNECK IDIOT. HANG ON, I GOT MY SLIPPERS ON. PUT YOUR SLIPPERS ON? YOU GUYS WOKE ME UP. THAT'S EMBARRASSING. I THOUGHT I RAISED THEM BOYS WITH MORE SENSE THAN THAT. OH, DON'T YOU LOOK PRETTY? SHUT UP. HEY. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE, SON. COME ON. UH-OH. UHH! PFFT! THE CEO IS DOWN! YOU GOT YOUR REDNECK CITIZENSHIP BACK. FATHER, WE THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER DAY. WE THANK YOU ESPECIALLY FOR THESE FROGS. I WILL ADMIT, FATHER, THESE WERE RATHER HARD EARNED. WE'RE ALIVE ON PLANET EARTH ONE MORE DAY, AND FOR THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL. AMEN. All: AMEN. LET'S EAT. DIG IN. EVERY ACTION IN LIFE BEGINS WITH A DECISION, AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T ALWAYS MAKE THE BEST ONES. I'VE LEARNED THE HARD WAY THAT, SOMETIMES, YOU JUST HAVE TO MAN UP AND APOLOGIZE FOR MISTAKES MADE. BUT OTHER TIMES, I'VE LEARNED YOU HAVE TO LET LOOSE IN ORDER TO BE TIGHTER WITH THOSE YOU LOVE. WILLIE, DON'T FORGET... PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES ARE NEXT WEEK. JEP, WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEXT WEEK? WILLIE.
