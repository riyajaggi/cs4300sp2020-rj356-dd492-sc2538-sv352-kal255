 HERE I CAN'T FIND NOTHING. IT'S A LITTLE CLUTTERED. THERE'S A PANDA. STOP THROWING CRAP! YOU'RE GONNA BREAK SOMETHING. THAT'S GARBAGE. I GET AFTER MOM ALL THE TIME. AND IT'S JUST PLAYFUL, AND IT'S JUST JOKING. HEY, THAT'S A TYPEWRITER. IF SHE WANTS TO FILL HER HOUSE UP WITH A BUNCH OF STUFF, HEY. BUT SHE DOES NEED TO HEAR IT, THOUGH. WHAT IS THIS? YOU KNOW THE MAN THAT BRINGS ME THE EGGS? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO PUT 'EM IN? MAN, THIS IS GARBAGE. MY THINGS ARE COLLECTIONS. I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY. WHY DO YOU HAVE CLOTHES LAYING THERE? I GET A SHIRT FOR EVERY AIRPORT I GO THROUGH. GIVE ME THAT. KAY, IT'S OUT OF CONTROL. NO. NO, IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE? WHAT? YOU LOOK LIKE A HOARDER. I DO HAVE HOARDING TENDENCIES. THEY SAID IT'S A MENTAL DISORDER. SO I MAY HAVE THAT. WE HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS IN MY FAMILY AND PHIL'S. IT KINDA MAKES YOU SEE WHY THE BOYS ARE LIKE THEY ARE. CLEAN THIS CRAP UP. IF HE BROKE THAT TYPEWRITER, HE'S GONNA PAY FOR THAT. MEET THE ROBERTSON CLAN. THEY TURNED DUCK CALLS... INTO A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR EMPIRE. BUT RUNNING A FAMILY BUSINESS IS TOUGH WHEN THE FAMILY JUST WANTS TO RUN WILD. WHOO! ♪ YOU BEEN WALKIN' AROUND ♪ ♪ ALL OF YOUR LIFE ♪ ♪ THE BLOOD THAT YOU'RE ♪ ♪ BORN IN IS SWEATIN' ♪ ♪ YOU BEEN WORKING AND SLAVING ♪ ♪ YOU'RE WHOLE LIFE AWAY ♪ OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn BOYS, THIS IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. I MEAN, IT'S NOT THAT BAD. HOWEVER, WE NEED A REFURBISHING OF IT. MY IDEA OF HAPPINESS IS KILLING THINGS... BUP BUP BUP BUP BUP BUP BUP BUP. SO DUCK BLINDS ARE A BIG THING WITH ME. ESPECIALLY THE ONE I'VE SPENT 20 YEARS SHOOTING DUCKS OUT OF. LOOKS LIKE WE GOT US A SNAKE DEN HERE. THEY'VE ALL DENNED UP HERE. I MEAN, IT CAN BE FIXED. I KNOW YOU'RE SENTIMENTAL TOWARD IT, BUT I'M JUST... THE BEST THING TO DO IS JUST TO LET IT GO, AND LET'S START OVER. PHIL HAS, LIKE, 35 BLINDS DOWN THERE. BUT HE GETS REALLY SENTIMENTAL, HE GETS HUNG UP ON ONE. "BECAUSE BACK IN '87, WE SHOT THAT WHATEVER OUT OF IT." I'M, LIKE, "DAD, YOU'VE GOTTA LET THESE THINGS GO." WILLIE BOY AND JASE, SINCE THEY WEREN'T IN ON THE BUILDING, THEY CAN JUST COME IN AND SAY, "HELL, LET'S GET RID OF IT." YOU KNOW, COMES EASY IF YOU WEREN'T DOWN THERE BUILDING THE DOGGONE THING. PHIL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS BLIND. HEY, RED, YOU GOT IT ALL WIRED UP? OH, YEAH, IT'S READY TO GO. READY TO GO. NO MISTAKES? NO MISTAKES. LET'S DO THIS. WILLIE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DESTRUCTIVE YOUNG MAN. I COMPARE HIM TO A YOUNG 'COON. WHAT HE CAN'T TEAR UP, HE CRAPS ON. BLOW THAT SUCKER UP. FIRE IN THE HOLE. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED, RED? RED? WHAT DO YOU THINK? GO AHEAD, RED. WHOA. LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT REDNECK LOGIC. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE SOMETHING AWAY FROM HIM, JUST BLOW IT UP, BECAUSE THEN HE'S GONNA BE SO ENAMORED BY THE FIRE... WHOO! THAT HE'LL FORGET ALL ABOUT WHAT HE'S LOSING. I MEAN, YOU CAN BLOW HIS HOUSE UP. IF IT LOOKS COOL ENOUGH, HE'S FINE WITH IT. HEY. WHERE YOU BEEN ALL DAY? BLOWIN' DUCK BLINDS, AS MUCH AS I HATE TO SAY IT. YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO GET OVER IT, WON'T YOU? WILLIE, HE'S THE ONE THAT CONCOCTED THAT SCHEME. A REDNECK STUNT IF I EVER SEEN ONE. IT'S NEVER DULL BEING MARRIED TO A ROBERTSON. NEVER. IT'S JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW, I'M THE MAN, YOU'RE THE WOMAN. WE'RE, LIKE, IN THE CAVE. BUT NOT REALLY. WE'RE IN MODERN TIMES. THEY BLEW THAT SUCKER TO... WELL, SPEAKING OF GETTING RID OF THINGS, THAT RV OUT THERE... IT'S UGLY, AND I WANT TO GET IT OUT. I'M GONNA HAVE A YARD SALE, AND THAT'S GONNA BE THE FIRST THING TO GO. THAT IS UNLIKE YOU TO MOVE STUFF OUT. WELL, IT'S A NEW DAY, DARLIN'. WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LAUGHING AT. AS MUCH STUFF AS YOU'VE GOT AROUND HERE, AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FIXIN' TO GET RID OF SOME OF IT? THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO REALIZE ABOUT THE SOUTH... EVERYTHING IS USEABLE. ONE MAN'S JUNK IS ANOTHER MAN'S TREASURE. YOU KNOW WHAT? LET ME GIVE YOU A JOB. YOU AND JIMMY RED ARE GONNA GO OUT THERE AND GET US SOME SQUIRRELS. I'M ON IT. I'M GOING SQUIRREL HUNTING. I LOVE FRIED SQUIRREL. I ALWAYS HAVE SINCE I WAS A GIRL. AND ESPECIALLY THE SQUIRREL BRAINS, WHICH PHIL LOVES TO TELL EVERYBODY IN THE WHOLE WORLD THAT, 'CAUSE THEY ALWAYS GO, "EWW, GROSS! THAT'S HORRIBLE." BUT I DO LIKE 'EM, I CAN'T HELP IT... THEY'RE GOOD. SHE WANTS TO FRY UP SOME RIGHT QUICK. THE FIRST TIME I WENT SQUIRREL HUNTING, I WAS SIX YEARS OLD. GOTTA BE A GOOD SHOT 'CAUSE THEY QUICK, AND THEY'RE LITTLE. YOU NEVER WANNA MAKE THE COOK MAD. WHEN THE GRUB RUNS OUT, THINGS GET TOUGH AROUND THE HOUSE. GOT ANOTHER ONE, RED. THEY SLICKED ME THE FIRST COUPLE HOURS, BUT YOU CAN'T EVEN SPELL SQUIRREL WITHOUT "SI." AND THAT'S ME. YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW LONG I'VE WORKED ON THAT. ME, I'M THE CEO OF THE BUSINESS. JASE, HE TUNES AND DESIGNS ALL THE CALLS. I MEAN, HE IS AN ARTISTE. HE'S LIKE A DUCK WHISPERER. HE SPEAKS DUCKANESE. ONCE YOU GET THAT SOUND, YOU GOT IT. JASE INVENTED A DUCK CALL CALLED THE "TRIPLE THREAT." IT'S GOT THREE REEDS INSTEAD OF TWO. BUT IT TOOK HIM SIX MONTHS TO COME UP WITH ONE. I WENT OUT AND SOLD THOUSANDS. AND WE NEED THOUSANDS IN OUR BIN TO SHIP OUT. WHAT, EXACTLY, IS THE PROBLEM? WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG? SI HAS TO DO THE REEDS. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL HE'S DOING UP HERE, BUT ON THE DOUBLE-REED SYSTEM, I COULD DO 1,000 A DAY IN EIGHT HOURS. 500 A DAY. SI, YOU AIN'T EVER WORKED EIGHT HOURS IN THE DAY. HEY, LOOK. HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS NAP TIME? LOOK HERE, DON'T GET IN ON THE NAP, BOYS. EVERYBODY'S SAYING IT'S JUST GONNA TAKE TIME. HOW MUCH TIME IS THAT? HEY. I FEEL SORRY FOR WILLIE, IN A WAY. HE'S GOT OF HEADACHES 'CAUSE HE'S THE CEO OF THE BUSINESS, OKAY? BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ME, HE'S MY NEPHEW, I'M HIS UNCLE, AND, HEY, I'M GONNA TAKE ME A GOOD TWO-HOUR NAP. MAYBE THREE. IT'S LIKE THE STORY OF THE LITTLE RED HEN. EVERYBODY WANTS TO EAT THE PIE, BUT NOBODY WANTS TO HELP MAKE THE PIE. WE NEED, LIKE, A NUMBER. WE NEED, LIKE, THIS DAY, THIS DAY WE'LL HAVE 'EM HERE. THIS IS WHEN IT'S GONNA BE ON THE MARKET. BALLPARK, GUESSTIMATE, ANYONE? HEY. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT. UH-OH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? MY DAD NEVER COMES TO THE WAREHOUSE. I MEAN, NEVER. WHEN HE COMES IN THE DOOR, YOU KNOW SOMETHING'S UP. UH-OH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? MY DAD NEVER COMES TO THE WAREHOUSE. I MEAN, NEVER. WHEN HE COMES IN THE DOOR, YOU KNOW SOMETHING'S UP. I BEEN THINKING. I HAVE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION FOR THAT STUNT YOU PULLED BLOWING MY DUCK BLIND UP. THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN. WE'VE GOT TO REPLACE THAT DUCK BLIND. AS YOU KNOW, YOUR MAMA'S BEEN ON MY BACK ABOUT THAT RAGGEDY RV PARKED IN MY YARD. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT THING, STICK IT ABOUT 20 FOOT UP IN THERE ON A PLATFORM, AND WE'RE STANDING THERE SHOOTING DUCKS OUT OF IT. OH, GOOD LORD. HERE WE GO. I CAN SEE THAT RV 20 FEET UP, CAMOUFLAGE NET, BRUSHED UP. I MEAN, I CAN SEE IT AS SOMETHING YOU'D SAY, "LOOKY HERE, LOOKY HERE! GOOD TIMES HAVE COME OUR WAY. I MEAN, THIS IS LIKE SOME KINDA DEAL OUTTA HOLLYWOOD." THINK ABOUT IT, BOYS. IT WILL BE THE MOTHER OF ALL DUCK BLINDS. OH, MY GOSH. HERE WE GO. MY FAMILY IS ONLY INTERESTED IN HUNTING AND BEING OUT THERE IN THE WOODS. BUT THAT DOESN'T PAY THE BILLS. IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA. IT'S A TREE HOUSE FOR ADULTS. AN RV IN THE TREES? I THOUGHT IT WAS BRILLIANT. ALL HANDS ON DECK... OH, MY GOSH. FOR THE MOTHER OF ALL DUCK BLINDS. SEE YOU IN THE WOODS. BUT WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO. SO MUCH FOR THE DUCK CALLS. HERE'S THE DEAL, PHIL STARTED THE COMPANY. I MEAN, BEHIND MY NAME IS "CEO," BUT IN REALITY, PHIL'S GONNA GET WHAT HE WANTS. THIS IS THE WORST IDEA IN THE HISTORY OF DUCK COMMANDER. THIS WILL BE OUR NEW HOME, BOYS. PHIL, THIS IS IN WORSE SHAPE THAN THE ONE WE GOT RID OF. THIS IS NICE, MAN. OH, YEAH, REAL NICE, PHIL. LOOK AT THIS. I MEAN, YOU GOT RUNNING WATER. PHIL, THIS IS THE NASTIEST THING. OH! HOW'D HE GET IN THERE? IT WAS A DADGUM POSSUM. IT WAS JUST AN OLD POSSUM THAT HAD GOTTEN UP IN THAT RV, AND ON A SPUR OF THE MOMENT I SAID, "WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU THREW A POSSUM ON A MAN?" WE GOT A MAN DOWN! MARRIED A YUPPIE GIRL, LIVING IN THE SUBDIVISION... THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU. A POSSUM WILL SCARE YOU. MY QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET IT IN THE TREES? I GOT REINFORCEMENTS COMING. I HEAR SOME KIND OF MACHINERY, BOYS. BEING A WEALTHY REDNECK DOES HAVE ITS ADVANTAGES. THE CAVALRY HAS ARRIVED. 'CAUSE NO MATTER HOW DUMB AN IDEA IS... ALL RIGHT, BOYS... LET'S GET TO WORK. WE CAN ALWAYS HIRE AN ENTIRE REDNECK ARMY TO MAKE SURE THE JOB GETS DONE. PHIL DIDN'T BELIEVE ME WHEN I TOLD HIM I WAS GONNA HAVE A YARD SALE AND GET RID OF ALL THAT JUNK. BUT I THOUGHT, WELL, I'VE LIVED WITH THIS JUNK IN THIS HOUSE FOR YEARS, SO WE'RE GONNA DO IT, AND THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GONNA GO. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT ON THESE GUNS RIGHT HERE? I WOULD SAY $20. $20? THESE GUNS ARE ABOUT 100 YEARS OLD. DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A GOOD PRICE TO YOU? YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAWS WILL BE SO HAPPY TO HELP ME WITH THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THE JUNK. AWW, JJ. JJ, YOU GOTTA GO. WHAT IS A FLY SWATTER... THAT CHAIR IS THE MOST DISGUSTING THING. I MEAN, IT STINKS. THERE'S A FEW DOG TOYS. IT'S GOT DUCK FEATHERS ON IT. THERE'S NO TELLING HOW MUCH FOOD, PHIL'S BEARD HAIR, INSECTS... THAT CHAIR IS A HEALTH HAZARD, SO IT'S GOTTA GO. PHIL'S ALWAYS, LIKE, "DON'T TOUCH MY STUFF. DON'T TOUCH MY STUFF." HE'S GONNA BE MAD. ZACH, GET UP THERE. PUT A SCREW IN IT. WILLIE THE CEO LOVES TO WORK IN THE BUSINESS, MAKE MONEY, MAKE YOUR BUSINESS SUCCESSFUL. LEVEL ENOUGH. WILLIE THE CEO IS NOT GONNA GO ALL-OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT A TRAILER GETS UP IN THE AIR TEN FEET. MY HANDS ARE CLEAN OF THIS WHOLE DEAL. I NEVER SEEN A BUNCH OF REDNECKS ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH SO QUICKLY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I CAN'T STAND UP. MY KNEE'S HURTING. I MEAN, IS THAT... IS HE KIDDING? FIVE MINUTES BEFORE WE STARTED WORKING, AND YOU GOT A CAREER-ENDING KNEE INJURY. I HURT IT WHEN HE THREW THE POSSUM AT ME. WILLIE DOESN'T LIKE MANUAL LABOR. HE DOESN'T LIKE TO SWEAT. IT'S BEEN MY STUDIED OPINION THAT ONCE YOU GET THE TITLE "CEO," IF YOU INTERJECT MANUAL LABOR, INJURIES BEGIN TO OCCUR. WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO IS GET YOU A CREW. Y'ALL GET OVER AND YOU GET IT PAINTED BY THE TIME WE GET THIS THING KNOCKED OUT. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN STAND UP AND PAINT. YOU CAN DO THIS. HE'S LIKE A BLISTER... IT SHOWS UP WHEN THE WORK'S ALL GONE. COME AND GET IT. THE GARAGE SALE IS OFFICIALLY ON. YOU LIKE IT? GOOD. EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE A GARAGE SALE, IT'S LIKE ANY OTHER THING I HAVE AT MY HOUSE... IT'S ALWAYS FOOD INVOLVED. ALWAYS. I LOVE MEETING NEW PEOPLE. COME BACK AND SEE ME. A PARTY'S NOT A PARTY WITHOUT JAMBALAYA. THANK YOU. HEY, UNCLE SI. YEAH? YOU ABOUT TO LOSE YOUR CUP. OH, NO, WILLIE, I AIN'T GONNA LOSE THIS CUP. I SPENT 24 1/2 YEARS IN THE MILITARY, AND HALF THE PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW MY NAME. BUT WHEN THEY SAID, "OH, YEAH, YOU KNOW HIM. IT'S ALWAYS THAT GUY THAT COMES TO FORMATION WITH THAT TUPPERWARE GLASS FULL OF ICED TEA IN HIS HAND." SO WHERE ALL HAS THAT CUP BEEN? LET'S SEE, FORT POLK, LOUISIANA, FORT KNOX, KENTUCKY. GERMANY. THREE OR FOUR PLACES OVER THERE. VIETNAM. MAMA SENT IT PACKED IN A CARE PACKAGE WITH A TUPPERWARE GLASS IN IT IN '68, WHEN I WAS IN VIETNAM. DO YOU WASH IT IN THE DISHWASHER? NO, I BLEACH IT. YOU WASH YOUR DISHES IN BLEACH? THIS IS MY TRADEMARK. THAT'S SOME KIND OF COLLECTOR'S ITEM. THERE'S THREE THINGS I TRAVEL WITH. ONE OF 'EM IS THIS CUP. THE OTHER IS A GALLON JUG OF TEA. AND THEN THE FINAL AND MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE BIBLE. I NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT THEM THREE THINGS. WHAT ABOUT A WEAPON? WELL, HEY, THAT'S NUMBER FOUR. PERFECT. BOY, I'M PROUD OF THAT JOB Y'ALL DID THERE. BOYS, IT LOOKS LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS. LET'S RAISE IT UP. I'M A DUCK BLIND BUILDER FROM WAY BACK. BUT THIS ONE... IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT, LET ME PUT IT THAT WAY. THAT RV IS JUST A PIECE OF JUNK. IF ONE SCREW FALLS OUT OF IT, ALL THE WALLS WILL FALL OUT, AND IT'LL JUST TOPPLE OVER RIGHT THERE. GOOD LUCK GETTING THAT THING IN THE AIR. HEY, ARE WE GONNA LIFT THIS THING UP AND PUT IT UP THERE OR NOT? SI, WHY ARE YOU SAYING "HEY" EVERY SENTENCE? NO, NO. HEY. WHAT DOES "HEY" MEAN? I'M JUST WONDERING. Y'ALL GIVE IT THE MEANING THAT YOU WANT IT TO HAVE. HEY. THE WORD "HEY" IS LIKE A FABRIC WOVEN INTO SI'S CHARACTER. HEY, OWEN, LET'S GO. HEY! THESE CLOWNS, HEY, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. HE JUST "HEYed" AGAIN. HEY. HEY. IT'S AUTOMATIC. I SAY HEY. HEY. HEY CAN MEAN YES, HEY CAN MEAN MAYBE, HEY CAN MEAN NO. HEY CAN MEAN NEXT WEEK. THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND ME TO UNDERSTAND HEY. HEY. HEY. HEY! LET'S GET IT DONE, BOYS. OH, YEAH! SMOOTH, STEADY AS SHE GOES. ALL RIGHT, EASE ON DOWN. WATCH THE EXTENSION. THERE YOU GO, PICK IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND THEN MOVE ON OUT. NOW WE'RE COOKING WITH PEANUT OIL! HEY. HEY! HEY. COME ON IN, BOYS. WHAT'S THIS? HUH? WE GOT HEAT. WHAT ABOUT THAT? WE CAN COOK. MICROWAVE. THAT WORKS. COFFEE MAKER. HUH? MY HOUSE ISN'T THIS NICE. IT'S A WOODED GETAWAY. NOW, THAT WAS MORE WILLIE'S DEPARTMENT... DECORATING. I LIKE IT IN THERE. IT'S NICE. BUT THIS IS MORE NICE. HEY, THIS IS A GOOD VIEW. I'M GLAD YOU BLEW IT UP, WILL. I HEAR YA. I BET I COULD SELL ONE OR TWO OF THESE. THANK Y'ALL. ALL RIGHT, SEE Y'ALL LATER. SOMEBODY ACTUALLY BOUGHT THAT CHAIR. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GONNA GO TO THE DUMP. BUT THEY ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT. SOMETIMES IT AMAZES ME WHAT PEOPLE WILL SPEND GOOD MONEY ON. I KINDA LIKE THAT SQUIRREL THERE. WELL, I CAN SELL YOU THAT SQUIRREL. I GOT ANOTHER SQUIRREL I CAN PUT HIM BESIDE. WOULD YOU TAKE $5 FOR HIM? I'LL TAKE $5. YOU WOULD? YOU CAN HAVE IT FOR $5. ALL RIGHTY. THAT LOOKED LIKE MY CHAIR. I KNOW THAT'S MY SQUIRREL. HEY, MOUNTAIN MAN. HEY, WILLIE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY SQUIRREL? I BOUGHT IT AT A GARAGE SALE KORIE'S HAVING DOWN THE ROAD. THAT'S MY SQUIRREL. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOUR SQUIRREL. YEAH, THAT'S MY SQUIRREL. WELL, I GAVE $5 FOR IT. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $10, AND I'M TAKING IT BACK. I'D RATHER HAVE THE SQUIRREL, WILLIE. LET ME REPHRASE THIS, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU $10, AND THIS DEAL'S OVER. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. HEY, MOUNTAIN MAN. HEY. HEY, MOUNTAIN MAN. WHAT IN THE WORLD'S ALL THIS? HMM. HEY. MISS KAY, TELL ME THAT WAS NOT MY CHAIR HEADING UP THE ROAD WITH THEM HIPPIE GIRLS. I WOULD SAY IT'S KIND OF A SHOCK TO A MAN'S SYSTEM, YOU KNOW, WHEN SOME OF HIS STUFF IS OUT IN THE YARD BEING PAWNED OFF TO THE LOCAL REDNECKS. 47 YEARS MARRIED TO YOUR MAMA. GETTIN' RID OF HIS CHAIR'S LIKE GETTING RID OF HIS DOG. I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO PHIL SINCE I WAS 16. HE ALWAYS HAS TROUBLE LETTING GO OF THINGS AND ANY KIND OF CHANGE. IT STUNK. WE HAD A GARAGE SALE. WE GOT RID OF THE JUNK. I DIDN'T CONSIDER MY CHAIR, AT THIS POINT, TO BE RUMMAGE. HEY, BUDDY, I'LL GET YOU A NEW CHAIR. HOW 'BOUT THAT? NOW WE'RE COOKIN' WITH PEANUT OIL. THERE YOU GO. WOMEN ARE LIKE LABRADOR RETRIEVERS. YOU KNOW, THEY ALL HAVE QUIRKS. BUT YOU STAY MARRIED TO ONE 45, 50 YEARS, YOU LEARN TO GO WITH THE QUIRKS. HOW MUCH DID Y'ALL MAKE? ALMOST $600. I WANT $10 OF IT BACK, 'CAUSE I JUST HAD TO BUY THIS BACK. HOW 'BOUT Y'ALL GO CLEAN UP AND GET READY FOR SUPPER. I'M ON MY WAY. FATHER, WE THANK YOU FOR THE WOODS, WE THANK YOU FOR THE WATER, AND WE THANK YOU FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT LIVE IN THEM. THANK YOU FOR BLESSING US TONIGHT, ESPECIALLY WITH THIS GOOD MEAL. All: AMEN. LET'S GET INTO SOME OF THESE BUSHY TAILS. PEOPLE ARE NATURE'S NUMBER ONE CREATURE OF HABIT. WE TEND TO GET COMFORTABLE, STUCK IN OUR WAYS, AND FEAR CHANGE. WE LIKE TO HOLD ON TO OLD THINGS IN ORDER TO HOLD ON TO OLD MEMORIES WHEN, USUALLY, THEY KEEP US FROM MAKING NEW ONES. SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA BITE THE BULLET AND MAKE A CLEAN BREAK FROM THE PAST TO START A FRESH BEGINNING. HEY, UNCLE SI. HEY. Men: HEY... HEY... HEY.
