 HOO! GOOD GRACIOUS ALIVE. I'M ABOUT TO LOSE MY LUNCH. LOOK, HERE, ROADKILL, IT'S TOP-OF-THE-LINE ODOR. IT'LL MAKE YOUR HAIR STAND ON END. IT'LL RUN YOU SLAM OUT OF LOUISIANA. THROW THAT CRAP OUT. NOBODY SAID MAKING A DOLLAR IS EASY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT SMELLS BAD. MEET THE ROBERTSON CLAN. THEY TURN DUCK CALLS... INTO A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR EMPIRE. BUT RUNNING A FAMILY BUSINESS IS TOUGH WHEN THE FAMILY JUST WANTS TO RUN WILD. WHOO! WHOO! YOU DON'T HAVE TO BLOW THAT LOUD. OH, YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE IT'LL GO. DO YOU HEAR ME DOING THAT? I DON'T HEAR YOU DOING MUCH OF NOTHING OVER THERE. WELL, I'M INVENTING A NEW DUCK CALL. IS THIS NEW CALGONNA MAKE MONEY? NO, SI, WE'RE JUST GONNA GIVE 'EM AWAY. I'M BACK THERE WITH THE RIFFRAFF. I'M AN INVENTOR. YOU CAN'T PUT ME IN THIS SETTING AND EXPECT ME TO INVENT. WILLIE, I NEED A NEW OFFICE. YOU HAVE AN OFFICE. I JUST NEED A PLACE TO GET AWAY UP HERE SO I CAN CONCENTRATE. YOU WANT AN OFFICE UP HERE? I'M THE C.O.O. OH, JASE. IN THIS COMPANY, WILLIE'S NUMBER ONE. I'M NUMBER TWO. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S TREATING ME LIKE... A BIG PILE OF NUMBER TWO. YOU'RE DOING GREAT IN THAT SPACE. AN OFFICE IS FOR SMART PEOPLE. JASE ISN'T EXACTLY PART OF THE BRAIN TRUST. HE'S MORE LIKE A BRAIN FART. JASE, I CAN'T HELP YOU. YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE OF THESE OFFICES. THEY'RE FULL. WHATEVER. THE OLD SWAMP PROVIDES, COLE. MAINLY I USE THE GRANDKIDS WHEN IT COME TO CRAWFISHING JUST AS A LABOR POOL. I DID THIS FOR A LIVING ONE TIME. BUT NOW THE DUCK CALL IS SELLING GOOD. WE EATING LIKE KINGS. COLOR TV. HOT WATER. MY GRANDKIDS HAVE A LOT. THEY ARE FAR BETTER OFF THAN WE WERE AS CHILDREN. WAY BETTER OFF. WE'VE COME A LONG WAY. MY JOB IS TO GET THEM TO APPRECIATE THAT, NOT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. WE GOT ABOUT 2 1/4 SACKS THERE. LIFE IS GOOD, COLE, MAN. LIFE IS REAL GOOD. WHAT YOU BEEN UP TO? I TRIED TO GET A NEW OFFICE FOR ME, BUT THEY'RE ALL FULL. I'M THE C.O.O. I NEED A PLACE TO THINK. WHAT IF WE JUST BUILD ONE? MARTIN LOOKS REALLY DUMB. THAT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST IDEAS YOU'VE EVER HAD. BUT HE'S REALLY SMART. YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE, YOU DO IT YOURSELF. THAT'S WHAT STARTED THIS COMPANY. THAT'S WHAT STARTED THIS COUNTRY. THAT'S IT. HEY. WE'LL HELP YOU BUILD IT. I DON'T THINK WE OUGHT TO TELL WILLIE. NO. THIS IS GONNA HAVE TO BE A COVERT OPERATION. AS SOON AS HE LEAVES, WE'LL START. WE'LL BUILD IT AND ASK FOR FORGIVENESS LATER. LET'S DO IT. IN THE ARMY, THEY CALL THAT INITIATIVE. YUP. GO ON THE OFFENSE. THEN I'M GONNA CLOSE THE DOOR IN HIS FACE AND SAY, "I'M BUSY." TELL HIM I'M BUSY. DON'T BOTHER ME RIGHT NOW. HI. WHATEVER YOU'RE MAD ABOUT, I DIDN'T DO IT. I'M NOT MAD. OH. NO, YOU DOING GOOD. HEY, LOOK, KORIE'S OUT OF TOWN, AND I GOT ROPED INTO THE PETTING ZOO WITH MISS KAY. SO HELP ME OUT. I NEED Y'ALL TO MAKE SURE YOU GET THE STUFF DONE. HAVE FUN AT THE PETTING ZOO. GO TO THE PETTING ZOO, YOU DOG. ANYBODY WANT TO TRADE WITH ME? NO, YOU'RE GOOD. HAVE FUN AT THE ZOO. THIS IS PERFECT. HE'S GONE, I SAY LET THE BUILDING BEGIN. WELL, WHAT ARE WE WAITING ON? WELCOME TO THE WARDEN'S OFFICE. I'M THINKING RIGHT HERE. WE GOT A WALL. WE GOT A DOOR. ALL WE GOT TO DO IS BUILD THREE WALLS. IF A BUNCH OF EGYPTIANS COULD BUILD PYRAMIDS WITH NO EQUIPMENT, I THINK I CAN TAKE THREE GROWN MEN AND BUILD AN OFFICE IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS. SI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SI'S MEASURING. 16 FEET. I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE PRACTICING FOR A FIELD SOBRIETY TEST OR SOMETHING. HEY, DO ME A FAVOR. WHAT? TOUCH YOUR NOSE LIKE THIS AND STAND ON ONE LEG. NO, I CAN'T DO IT. OH. WHAT'S IN THAT CUP? EASY, BOY. EASY. ARE YOU SOBER? SURE, I'M SOBER. I DON'T WANT YOU TO NAIL YOUR OWN FOOT. OH, LOOK AT ALL OF 'EM. I LOVE ANIMALS. I PROBABLY HAD OVER MY CHILDHOOD ABOUT 50 CATS, 25 DOGS. THE MOST UNUSUAL ONE I EVER HAD WOULD BE THE NUTRIA RAT. HE ONE DAY DECIDED TO BITE MY LEG, AND HE WAS GONE. WILLIE, YOU NEVER MILKED A COW? NOT REGULARLY. JUST SQUEEZE AND PULL DOWN. LET'S SEE HERE. THAT'S QUITE THE TEAT. OH. I DON'T MIND SPENDING TIME WITH MY FAMILY. I LOVE DOING THAT. BUT WHEN I'M GONE FROM THE WAREHOUSE, NOTHING GETS DONE. BRING IT ON HERE, GODWIN. EASY. UNLOAD! I CAN BUILD ANYTHING. I MEAN, LOOK, IF A BEAVER CAN BUILD A HOUSE, I THINK I CAN BUILD AN OFFICE. I'M LIKING IT ALREADY. WHEN YOU GROW UP WITH YOUR BROTHERS, YOU KNOW JUST THE RIGHT BUTTON TO PUSH TO SEND 'EM OFF. THIS RIGHT HERE, BUILDING THIS OFFICE, IT'S GONNA PUSH WILLIE'S BUTTON. IT'LL BE FOURTH OF JULY AROUND THERE FOR A COUPLE DAYS. BOTTLE ROCKETS. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. THE ONLY WAY IN AND OUT OF HERE IS THROUGH WILLIE'S OFFICE? YOU ARE CORRECT. WILLIE IS MY BROTHER. I USED TO SLEEP IN THE SAME BED WITH THAT JOKER. THAT'S UNFORTUNATE. OH, I KNOW. I MEAN, I'VE SEEN THAT BOY WET THE BED. YOU KNOW WHAT I SAW WILLIE DO ONE TIME? I SAW HIM, WHEN HE WAS A KID, LAYING DOWN, AND HE WAS PEEING AT AN ARC, AND IT WAHITTING HIM RIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED GOATS. HA. IN MY OPINION, YOU'RE NOT A PROPER WOMAN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GOAT OR TWO. I REALLY, REALLY WANT A GOAT. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A FENCE. WELL, YOU CAN BUILD A PEN. OKAY, HOW MUCH LONGER? WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. I'M NOT LEAVING HERE WITHOUT A GOAT. I'M SERIOUS. HEY, IF I GET YOU A GOAT, CAN WE JUST LEAVE? YEAH, BUT MORE THAN ONE OF COURSE. ARE THESE GOATS FOR SALE? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. I'LL GIVE YOU $100. $100 WOULDN'T BUY THE HORNS OFF OF ONE OF 'EM. I'LL TAKE $1,000 AND YOU CARRY 'EM WITH YOU. THEY'LL FIT JUST RIGHT IN THE BACK OF YOUR ESCALADE. NO. WILLIE, IT'S JUST A CAR. THAT'S A $70,000 CAR. I'M NOT PUTTING GOATS IN THE BACK OF IT. I WANT THE GOATS. I WANT THE GOATS. I AIN'T PUTTING NO GOATS IN THE BACK OF THAT ESCALADE, I'M GONNA TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW. AAH! THEY'RE EATING MY PANTS! OKAY, THIS IS THE DUMBEST IDEA YOU'VE EVER HAD. WELL, ONCE WE GET 'EM HOME, THEY'LL BE FINE. KAY, DON'T LET THOSE GOATS CRAP BACK THERE. POOP POOP. OH, GOODNESS. BRING IT ON IN. A LITTLE MORE? HOLD. HOLD RIGHT THERE. HEY, HEY, WHOA. WHEN I SAID I WANTED A NEW OFFICE, I GOT ONE OF THESE. SO I'M TAKING IT UPON MYSELF TO BUILD MY OWN OFFICE. AND GUESS WHAT? I'M GONNA BUILD IT RIGHT BESIDE THE BOSS. DOWN. DOWN. NO, YOUR OTHER DOWN. THERE YOU... OH, OH. OKAY, I'M OUT OF HERE. I GOT THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE RIGHT HERE, BOY. I DIDN'T ASK THEM TO HELP ME 'CAUSE I THINK THEY'RE SMART. I BASICALLY NEED LIVE BODIES WITH A HEARTBEAT. INTELLIGENCE IS OPTIONAL. YOU GOT ME BACKED INTO ONE SPOT. NOBODY MOVED THE LADDER THERE. YOU SAID PUT IT RIGHT THERE WHERE YOU WERE STANDING. HEY, YOU GOT TO BE MORE PACIFIC. PACIFIC OR SPECIFIC? SI, THE PACIFIC IS AN OCEAN. YEAH. NO, WE AIN'T TALKING ABOUT NO ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC HERE. HOW DID YOU GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL? HE DIDN'T. YOU BE MORE ATLANTIC, 'CAUSE MARTIN'S GONNA BE MORE PACIFIC. AND I'LL BE THE INDIAN. YOU KNOW, I GET TO TALKING FAST, AND THEY HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING ME. THEY JUST NEED TO THINK FASTER. ARE WE GONNA BUILD THIS ROOF, OR ARE WE GONNA PLAY WITH OCEANS ALL AFTERNOON? THAT WAY THEY CAN KEEP UP WITH MY VOICE. WHO BROUGHT OCEANS UP TO BEGIN WITH? YEAH, THEY'RE DROPPING BOMB-BOMBS ALL OVER YOUR SEAT. WHAT ARE THEY DOING? DROP, DROP, DROP. EVERYWHERE. IT'S JUST LIKE A GUM MACHINE WITH POOP IN IT. THEY'RE CRAPPING EVERYWHERE, I HATE TO TELL YOU THAT. THESE GOATS, THEY'RE LIKE FOUR-LEGGED DEVILS. I MEAN, THEY'RE PEEING, THEY'RE POOPING, THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN DO TO DESTROY THIS CAR. HEY. HEY, HEY, HEY. HEY, GET IN BACK. I CAN'T DRIVE. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO GET THESE GOATS. WHOO. THE OBJECT IS TO HIT IT ON THE HEAD. GO STRAIGHT UP. LET ME SEE. OH, GOOD NIGHT. I THINK WILLIE'S GONNA BE HAPPY THAT I'VE BUILT THIS OFFICE RIGHT BESIDE HIM. I'M GONNA TELL YOU, IT'S AMAZING, WHEN I GET A BUNCH OF REDNECKS TOGETHER, WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH. REDNECK INGENUITY. THEY'RE GENIUSES SOMETIMES. JASE? YEAH. HERE'S MY CONTRIBUTION TO YOU. SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND GEORGE. WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT. NOW YOU GOT TO TREAT GEORGE RIGHT NOW. OLD GEORGE THE BEAVER, HE'S BEEN WITH ME FOR ABOUT 20-SOME-ODD YEARS. THAT WAS LIKE LOSING ONE OF MY CHILDREN. DON'T PLAY WITH MY BEAVER TOO MUCH. HEY, HE DON'T LIKE IT. COLE, MAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT CRAWFISHING, SON? IT'S GOOD EATING. AUT ONE OF THE BEST EATING THINGS THERE IS ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. SEE, THERE'S A FEMALE. THERE'S HER LITTLE... HER LITTLE VAGINA, AS THEY CALL IT. RIGHT THERE. SEE THE MALE RIGHT HERE? THERE'S HIS, AS THEY SAY IN THE BUSINESS, DINGDONG. HE PUTS IT RIGHT UP IN THERE. TAKES TWO TO TANGO. DOWN HERE IN THE SOUTH, YOU EXPLAIN THE BIRDS AND BEES TO YOUR GRANDSON VIA THE CRAWFISH. CRAWFISH HAVE DINGDONGS AND VAGINAS. IT'S A GOOD THING TO POINT TO AND SAY, "KIDS, CHECK THAT OUT." THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT. THEM LITTLE YUPPIE GIRLS, THEY DON'T EVEN LIKE CRAWFISH. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR HER. ON YOUR FIRST DATE, YOU CAN SAY, "WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT CRAWFISH?" AND IF SHE SAYS, "OOH, AY, AY," JUST GO AHEAD AND DUMP HER OUT. BUT THE KIND YOU WANT IS LIKE YOUR GRANDMA. SEE, WHEN I WALKED OUT THE DOOR, I LOOKED OVER THERE ON THE CABINET, SHE'S MAKING DOUGH. NOW WHEN THEY MAKING DOUGH FOR THE CRAWFISH PIE BEFORE YOU HAVE GONE TO RUN THE TRAPS, WHAT'S THAT TELL YOU? SHE'S CONFIDENT IN YOU. THAT'S A NICE WAY OF SAYING IT. YOU EDUCATED, BOY.

LIFE WAS GOOD BACK IN THE '60s. EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY, HAPPY. HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY. 20 BUCKS AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE, THAT'S FOR SURE. THAT'S JUST LITTLE STUFF YOU CAN PICK OUT AND EAT WHILE YOU'RE EATIN' YOUR CRAWFISH. YOU KNOW, EAT YOUR LITTLE CORN AND, WHAT'S THAT, A MUSHROOM? THERE'S A POTATO. GIVE ME SOME MORE CRAWFISH. YOU EAT A LOT OF THESE, COLE, YOU'LL MOVE BACKWARD AS FAST AS YOU CAN FORWARD. WHAT ABOUT IT? ABOUT TIME YOU SHOWED UP. THERE WAS A BUILDING HERE, AND IT'S GONE. IT'S LIKE IT VANISHED.
