 WEARING? HE'S WEARING CAMOUFLAGE PANTS. TO SAY THAT I WAS FORCED AGAINST MY OWN WILL TO COME TO THIS ART GALLERY WOULD BE A CORRECT ASSERTION. THIS IS MAN BECOMING INNOVATED. WHAT'S WORSE IS WILLIE TRYING TO PROVE... I LOVE THIS PIECE. THAT HE'S SOPHISTICATED. ANYBODY FOR A LITTLE OF THE

 VINO? WILLIE HAS WAY TOO MUCH FACIAL HAIR TO RISE TO THE NEXT LEVEL IN SOCIETY. MMM... IT'S REAL BALANCED. I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WINE. YOU GIVE ME A COUPLE OF DAYS, I'LL BE AN EXPERT. NUTTY. WHAT KIND OF WINE IS THIS? PINOT NOIR RESERVE. I LIKE THE FINER THINGS OF LIFE. MMM! THAT IS REALLY GOOD. I DIDN'T GET THE SOPHISTICATED GENE OF THIS FAMILY... LET'S MOVE ON. I STARTED THE SOPHISTICATED GENE OF THIS FAMILY. NOW WE GOT SOMEBODY WITH SOME STYLE. MEET THE ROBERTSON CLAN. THEY TURN DUCK CALLS... INTO A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR EMPIRE. BUT RUNNING A FAMILY BUSINESS IS TOUGH WHEN THE FAMILY JUST WANTS TO RUN WILD. WHOO! ♪ YOU BEEN WALKIN' AROUND ♪ ♪ ALL OF YOUR LIFE ♪ ♪ THE BLOOD THAT YOU'RE ♪ ♪ BORN IN IS SWEATIN' ♪ ♪ YOU BEEN WORKING AND SLAVING ♪ ♪ YOU'RE WHOLE LIFE AWAY ♪ HELLO, TEAM. HOW YOU DOIN'? HEY, BABE. HOW ARE Y'ALL? All: GOOD. YOU LOOK NICE TODAY. DID YOU WEAR THE PUFFY SHIRT? I LIKE MY PUFFY SHIRT. NAH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS, BOYS. I JUST BOUGHT A VINEYARD. WHAT, DID YOU LOSE A BET? FEAST YOUR EYES ON TUSCADEROS. IS THAT IN AMERICA? I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT. ACTUALLY, I THINK I'M GONNA CHANGE THE NAME OF IT. EITHER TO "WILLIE'S... "WILLIE'S WINE"? IF SOMETHING STARTS OFF WITH "WILLIE," IT HAS TO BE MOONSHINE OR NOTHING. THAT DOESN'T SOUND SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH, BABE. WHY IS "WILLIE" NOT SOPHISTICATED? "WILLIE'S MOONSHINE." THAT FITS. "WILLIE'S WINE." NEVER. I GUARANTEE, YOU DO A CHECK, AND MOST PEOPLE NAMED WILLIE ARE EITHER IN PRISON, OR THEY'RE, LIKE, ON THE ARM WRESTLING CIRCUIT, YOU KNOW? I'M A BUSINESSMAN. I CAN SEE POTENTIAL. I HAVE A LITTLE PRESENTATION. OH, MY GOODNESS. AND WHEN THEY SEE IT, THEY'RE GONNA BE BLOWN AWAY. THAT'S WHAT YOU BOUGHT? YEAH. I HOPE YOU DIDN'T SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS. YOU'VE GONE OUT AND LOOKED AT THE GROUND? NO, I BOUGHT IT ONLINE. YOU BOUGHT IT ONLINE? YEAH, IT WAS IN AN AUCTION. I GOT A SMOKIN' DEAL. OH, MY GOODNESS. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING. IT LOOKS LIKE A CEMETERY. THIS IS LIKE SOMEBODY GIVING ME BACKSTAGE PASSES TO AN ENSURED DISASTER. Y'ALL ARE GONNA LOVE IT. THIS IS GONNA BE THE COOLEST THING WE'VE EVER DONE. I'M GOING ON THE SHIP BECAUSE IF IT CRASHES, I WANNA WATCH IT. "THE COOLEST THING WE'VE EVER DONE." YEAH. ARE Y'ALL HUNGRY? YES. YOUR FAVORITE... PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY. YAY! YES! MARY LIKES JELLY. SHE'S GONNA MAKE JELLY FOR HER HUSBAND WHEN SHE GETS BIG. I ONLY HAD FOUR SONS, SO BY HAVING THE GRANDDAUGHTERS, IT'S JUST LIKE THE DAUGHTERS I NEVER HAD BUT I ALWAYS WANTED. I KNOW WHO MY HUSBAND IS GONNA BE. JUSTIN BIEBER! NO, NO, NO. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS JUSTIN THE BEAVER. HE SEEMS TO HAVE SWEPT OVER ALL THE YOUNG GIRLS, BUT HE DON'T DO NOTHING FOR ME. WELL, HEY, LOOK WHO'S HERE. HEY! STEALING OUR M&Ms;! WHAT ABOUT IT? Y'ALL ARE SUPPOSED TO ASK "HOW MANY DID Y'ALL KILL?" TWO DUCKS. TWO DUCKS. THAT'S RIGHT, AND BE EXCITED ABOUT IT. HEY, PHIL, I'MA NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THE GRANDDAUGHTERS FOR A CHANGE. THE GIRLS HERE? WILLIE JUST CALLED. HE NEEDS ME FOR SOMETHING. YOU JUST TAKE THEM. YOU TEACH THEM ABOUT THE TREES AND THE WATER AND ALL THE GOOD STUFF. WHERE WE GO, THOSE GIRLS LIKE THAT GET KILLED. HEY! NO... I DON'T DO WELL WITH LITTLE GIRLS. BEING COOPED UP WITH 'EM ALL DAY? NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT'S THE MAMAW ZONE, NOT PAPAW. IT'S YOUR CHRISTIAN DUTY AS A GRANDPA TO TAKE TIME WITH THOSE KIDS. OH, I LOVE THEM LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTERS, YOU KNOW, BUT THEY ARE A CHORE. A BIG ONE. YOU AIN'T TALKING ABOUT TODAY? YEAH, I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY. LOOK, SI, YOU CAN HELP TOO. OKAY. TAKE CARE OF THESE GIRLS? THAT'S LIKE A VIETNAM FIREFIGHT. I GOTTA GET OUT OF THIS. DO NOT LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO THEM, OKAY? TEACH THEM SOME LIFE LESSONS. BYE, I LOVE Y'ALL. BYE. 'CAUSE I KNOW PHIL. IT'S EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. YEAH, I'LL TEACH 'EM SOME THINGS. START WITH SHUTTING UP AND SITTING DOWN. THAT'S THE WAY IT'LL BE WITH THE LITTLE GIRLS. IT'LL BE EVERY LITTLE GIRL FOR THEIRSELF. Y'ALL BE REAL QUIET FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. WHAT ARE Y'ALL GONNA DO? WE'RE GONNA TAKE A NAP. NOW WE'RE BABYSITTING, SI. WHAT HAVE WE GOT INTO? WE'RE SO THERE. OH, MY GOODNESS. OH, MY GOODNESS. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS, KAY? WHAT? IT'S THE ROBERTSON WINERY. I JUST BOUGHT IT. OH... I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT MY BOYS BUY SOMETHING I CAN ACTUALLY APPRECIATE. THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. LIKE BACK IN THE PIONEER DAYS, WHEN THEY HAD WINE, KAY. THIS IS THE VINEYARD. THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. MY QUESTION IS, WHERE ARE ALL THE GRAPES? OH. YEAH. NEEDS A LITTLE WORK. LITTLE WORK. HEY, WILLIE, YOU BIG EXTRAVAGANT PURCHASER. WHERE ARE THE GRAPES? WILLIE SHOWED ME A BUNCH OF PICTURES OF A BUNCH OF VINES. HEY, IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE THE PICTURES. SHOW ME THE GRAPES! YOU GOTTA PUT HAND TO PLOW, SON, HAND TO PLOW. TRYING TO MAKE WINE WITH NO GRAPES. DO YOU BELIEVE IN MIRACLES? I CAN SEE IT NOW. THIS WHOLE THING IS GONNA BE SLAM-FULL OF GRAPES. WE JUST HIT IT AT THE WRONG TIME. YOU CAN ALWAYS TURN WATER INTO WINE... IF YOU'RE JESUS. OH, IT'S GONNA BE NICE. THE LAST TIME I CHECKED, YOUR NAME WAS WILLIE. YOU GONNA BE BUYING WINE AT THE QUICK STOP. YEAH, THAT'S REAL FUNNY. I AIN'T SURE WHERE THE GRAPES WENT TO, BUT HEY, IT'S NO PROBLEM. WHEN IN DOUBT, FIGURE IT OUT. THAT'S THE REDNECK WAY. I THINK I NEED TO CALL IN AN EXPERT. YOU SHOULDA CALLED THE EXPERT BEFORE YOU BOUGHT THIS THING. THIS PLACE IS NICE, ISN'T IT? I KNOW. WE JUST GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT, DON'T WE? THAT'S WHY I GOT THE EXPERT COMING IN. LOOK, I REALIZE I'M IN OVER MY HEAD. WE DON'T HAVE ANY GRAPES, BUT DON'T HIT THE PANIC BUTTON. I GOT A SOMMELIER ON THE WAY. HEY, JEFF. HEY, HOW Y'ALL DOING? JEFF LANDRY, WITH LANDRY VINEYARDS. WE WERE JUST SO EXCITED ABOUT HEARING ABOUT YA'LL BUYING A WINERY. IT'S A TOUGH BUSINESS. GROWING IS TOUGH. WINEMAKING IS TOUGH TOO, I MEAN... YOU MIGHT SHOULD'VE FOUND OUT SOME FACTS, YOU KNOW, ABOUT... I LOOKED ONLINE. I READ A BUNCH OF STUFF. WELL, GOOD, I FEEL BETTER NOW. THANK YOU. MOST OF THE REDNECKS I KNOW THINK WINE ONLY COMES IN A BOX. THERE'S WAY MORE VARIETIES. CABERNET SAUVIGNON, MERLOT... THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE TWO THAT I KNOW ABOUT. WE WERE GONNA DO A WINE TASTING AT THE END OF THE MONTH. WELL, YOU GOT A... YOU GOT A WAYS TO GO BEFORE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SOMETHING IN A BOTTLE. YOU JUMPED THE GUN AS USUAL, DIDN'T YOU? I THOUGHT YOU JUST WENT OUT THERE AND PICKED 'EM. YOU HAVE A DEGREE, BUT IT'S NOT IN WINEMAKING, IS IT? NO, IT'S IN WINE DRINKING. OKAY. I MEAN, JESUS TURNED WATER INTO WINE. HOW HARD CAN IT BE? WELL, THERE'S A LITTLE LEAF. THIS IS BLANC DU BOIS. THAT'S THE NAME OF THIS GRAPE. BLONDE DA WHO? BLANC DU BOIS. IT'S A WINE GRAPE. SO ALL THESE ARE BLONDE DU BLONDES? UH, BLANC DU BOIS. BLONDE DU WAH. BLANC DU BOIS. BLONDE DU WAH. WILLIE CAN'T EVEN PRONOUNCE THE NAME OF THE GRAPES. IT'S BLONDE DU BRAH. SEE, I CAN'T EVEN PRONOUNCE THE NAME OF THE WINE. I MEAN, YOU'RE FOUR MONTHS AWAY BEFORE YOU'RE READY TO PRODUCE GRAPES, BUT YOU'RE STILL OVER A YEAR AWAY BEFORE YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN A BOTTLE, YOU KNOW? AW, MAN. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS GUY KNOWS, BUT I'M ABOUT THE LEAST PATIENT PERSON ON THIS PLANET. HE'S GIVING ME THE TEN-YEAR PLAN. I WANT THE TEN-DAY PLAN. I MEAN, YOU CAN BUY GRAPES, BUT THE PROBLEM IS THIS IS NOT HARVEST SEASON FOR ANY PART OF THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. THERE'S GRAPES AT THE GROCERY STORE, I SEE 'EM EVERY WEEK. COULD YOU JUST BUY 'EM AND BRING 'EM IN? WELL, THAT'S NOT THE SAME TYPE OF GRAPE. WINE GRAPES ARE VERY COMPLEX IN FLAVOR AND CHARACTER. WELL, WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. I JUST BOUGHT A WINE FARM WITH NO WINE ON IT. WE'VE GOT A HUGE WINE-TASTING EVENT THAT KORIE'S ALREADY SENT INVITATIONS OUT TO. WE GOT NO GRAPES, AND WE GOT NO WINE ON HAND. IT'S TIME FOR PLAN B. JASE, HEY. GET ME SOME WINE GRAPES. WINE GRAPES? WHEN BATMAN NEEDED SOMETHING, HE CALLED ROBIN. GOOGLE IT OR SOMETHING, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I GOT MY OWN BOY WONDER. YOU GET THE WINE GRAPES AND MEET US HERE. WELL, WILLIE... ALL RIGHT, BYE. SI, HOW'D WE GET ROPED INTO BABYSITTING DETAIL? ARE Y'ALL HAVING FUN YET? All: NO! THERE'S MORE YIPPING AND SQUEALING COMING OUT OF LITTLE GIRLS THAN I EVEN THOUGHT WAS IMAGINABLE. WHERE IS IT ALL COMING FROM? AAH! AAH! I WOULD SAY THAT'S JUST THIS SIDE OF HELL, MAYBE HELL ITSELF. UNCLE SI... HEY. WHY ARE WE HERE? WE GOT WORK TO DO ON THIS DUCK BLIND. GRAB THIS CANE AND START PUTTING IT ON THIS BLIND. THAT'S YOUR JOB, MISTER! IT'S YOUR JOB TODAY. IT AIN'T NO TELLING WHAT THESE GIRLS IS GONNA PUT ME AND HIM THROUGH. I... I PUT 'EM TO WORK, YOU KNOW? THAT WAY AT LEAST I GET SOMETHING OUT OF 'EM. LITTLE PIGLETS. HEY, LOOK HERE. GET SOME MORE MUD ON THAT BLIND. UNCLE SI, WHEN ARE WE GONNA DO SOMETHING WE WANNA DO? WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO? WE'RE WAITING TO DO A TEA PARTY. A TEA PARTY? WE AIN'T GOT NO TEAPOT. THEY'RE TRYING TO FEMINIZE US. I COULD'VE TRAINED A BUNCH OF MONKEYS TO DO MORE THAN THESE GIRLS BEEN HELPING TODAY. ALL THEY'VE DONE IS GET ME MUDDY. HEY! GET... GET OUT OF THE MUD! HEY! AND I FINALLY HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND STARTED AFTER 'EM WITH A STICK. THEIR MOTHER AND DADDY MAY NOT WHUP 'EM, BUT HELL, UNCLE SI WILL TEAR THEIR TAIL UP. SEE RIGHT HERE? THIS IS HOW YOU GET DUCKS. I LIKE CHICK-FIL-A, NOT DUCK. THAT'S A BAD SIGN. THESE AIN'T REDNECK GIRLS. THESE ARE YUPPIE GIRLS. NOPE. RICH KIDS. WHAT IS A REDNECK? WELL, HEY, YOU'RE NOT ONE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. THESE GIRLS HAVE GONE YUPPIE RIGHT BEFORE MY VERY EYES, AND IT'S A FRIGHTENING SIGHT. MY UNDIES ARE WET AND I AM TIRED! OH, THE THRILL AND THE WONDER OF GRANDCHILDREN. I'LL SHOW YOU REDNECK. I'M GONNA TEACH THESE GRANDKIDS OF MINE THE ROBERTSON WAY. LET'S GET 'EM BACK TO THE HOUSE AND HOSE ALL FOUR OF 'EM DOWN. COME ON, GET OUT OF THERE. LET'S GO. I'MA BE TASTING THESE GRAPES FOR A MONTH, 'CAUSE ALL THE JUICES DRAIN DOWN IN MY BEARD. THERE'S WILL. LOOK AT HIM. YOU GOT 'EM? OH, WE GOT 'EM. ALL THE GRAPES YOU CAN EAT. SEEMS LIKE A BAD SIGN WHEN YOU BUY A VINEYARD AND THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS BUY SOME GRAPES. WHAT VINEYARD DID YOU GET THESE FROM? I WENT TO THE GROCERY STORE AND I BOUGHT 'EM. HE SAID TO GET WINE GRAPES. I KNOW, BUT LISTEN TO ME. I LOOKED IT UP. ALL A WINE GRAPE IS IS A GRAPE WITH A LOT OF SUGAR IN IT. IT'LL WORK, I'M TELLING YOU. WELL, QUIT EATING ALL OF 'EM. COME RIGHT UP HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING. STAND RIGHT HERE, REAL STILL. STAND REAL CLOSE TOGETHER. GET IN A CIRCLE. Y'ALL HAD SO MUCH FUN GETTING ME AND PAPAW PHIL ALL MUDDY. NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME AND PAPAW PHIL TO HAVE SOME FUN. SEE, NOW WATCH, LOOK. COME OVER HERE, Y'ALL. DON'T BE MOVING. AAH! THERE AIN'T BUT ONE WAY I KNOW OF TO CLEAN UP A MUDDY GRANDCHILD.

ALL RIGHT, THAT'S THE CRUSHER. Y'ALL GET THE GRAPES IN THERE, I'LL GET IT FROM THE PRESS. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO! FIRE IN THE HOLE. MAYBE THIS IS EASIER THAN I THOUGHT. WE'RE TEN MINUTES INTO THIS...

NONE. WE JUST MADE SOME WINE. PURPLE GOLD. DO YOU NEED ONE OF THESE? I DON'T THINK I CAN USE THAT. I'M NOT A FEATHERY-TYPE PERSON. GRANDDAUGHTERS WILL EXHAUST YOU FAR MORE QUICKLY THAN GRANDSONS, THAT'S FOR SURE. YOU WANT SOME EARRINGS? FINGERNAIL POLISH? I THINK I'LL PASS ON BOTH OF 'EM. YOU KNOW, I DON'T DO MAKEUP.

THANK YOU, FATHER, FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN, OUR LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTERS. I PRAY, FATHER, WE NEVER FORGET WHERE WE CAME FROM AND WHERE WE ARE NOW. AMEN. All: AMEN. DIG IN! THERE AREN'T MANY SURE THINGS IN THIS WORLD, AND EVEN THE SMARTEST IDEAS MAY NOT PAY OFF, LIKE DUCK COMMANDER WINE, OR PHIL AND SI TAKING CARE OF YOUNG, IMPRESSIONABLE GIRLS. IF YOU WANT AN IDEA TO SUCCEED, YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISK, BECAUSE THE ONLY INVESTMENTS GUARANTEED NOT TO PAY OFF ARE THE ONES YOU NEVER MAKE. ANYBODY WANNA BUY A WINERY?
