 ♪ ♪ IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BONE DRY. HOUSTON, THERE IS A PROBLEM. SOMETHING IS AFOUL SOMEWHERE. WE ARE LOSING WATER AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING. WE'VE GOT BIG TIME PROBLEMS HERE. THAT WATER WAS A FOOT UP ON THEM OAK TREES OUT THERE, SI. IN ORDER TO ATTRACT DUCKS WE HAVE A LEVEE SYSTEM TO HOLD POOLS OF WATER. NO WATER, NO DUCKS. THAT AIN'T GOOD AT ALL.

 A MAN AND HIS BEAVERS. THEY AIN'T BEATING ME. PHIL'S THE DUCK COMMANDER. WELL, IF I COME UP WITH A BEAVER CALL... I COULD BECOME "THE BEAVER COMMANDER." GOT A NICE RING TO IT. "BEAVER COMMANDER." "BEAVER COMMANDER." MEASURE THOSE IN THAT BOWL AND THEN YOU DUMP THAT IN THERE. FIVE CUPS. IN THE KITCHEN, IT'S JUST A LOVE THAT'S BEEN THERE SINCE I WAS A GIRL. I WISH I COULD FIND A LOVE FOR CLEANING MY HOUSE. I COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW, AND I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH FUN WE'D HAVE IF I OPENED A RESTAURANT. YOU SHOULD. AND JUST COOK AND COOK AND COOK. I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD PAY TOP DOLLAR TO EAT YOUR COOKING. I BASICALLY FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN RUNNING A RESTAURANT FOR A LOT OF MEN FOR A LOT OF YEARS. HEY, BOYS. EXCEPT NOBODY PAYS. WHERE'S THE BISCUITS? I HAVEN'T MADE THE BISCUITS YET. WHAT GOOD IS JELLY WITHOUT BISCUITS? GUESS WHAT MY NEW IDEA IS? MAKING BISCUITS. I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF HAVING MY OWN RESTAURANT. KAY'S BEEN ON THIS RESTAURANT IDEA FOR YEARS. KAY, YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE JELLY ONE DAY AND THEN DECIDE TO START A RESTAURANT. I CAN'T FUND ALL MOM'S CRAZY IDEAS FOR BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW I CAN COOK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. HAVE I NOT BEEN DOING THAT FOR YEARS? HEY, A RESTAURANT IS MORE THAN COOKING, IT'S BUSINESS. ONE TIME SHE WANTED TO OPEN A PUBLIC LIBRARY... IN HER HOUSE. I LOVE BOOKS. I LIKE GOING TO THE LIBRARY. I DON'T WANT THAT IN MY HOUSE. WE'RE REALLY GONNA DO IT. OKAY. IT'S WORTH A TRY. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GET BACK ON... WHERE'S PHIL? WHERE IS PHIL ALWAYS? AT THE LAND. AAH! STOP IT! CAN YOU BELIEVE THEM SUCKERS DID THAT? I GOT NEWS FOR THEM BEAVERS. THEY AIN'T BEATING ME. PHIL? WILLIE TO PHIL. WILLIE TO PHIL? THAT'S THE CALL WE'VE BEEN WAITING ON. YEAH, I'M HERE. WHERE Y'ALL AT? WE'RE DOWN HERE LOOKING AT WHAT WAS THE PRIVET HOLE. WE ARE LOSING WATER VERY RAPIDLY. I WOULD SUSPECT IT'S THEM DAG-BLASTED BEAVERS. SO Y'ALL GET YOUR TAIL DOWN HERE, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND OUT WHERE THE PROBLEM IS, SEE IF WE CAN FIX IT. WE GOT TO GET ON THAT. IT'S TIME TO GO GET THE BEAVERS. THEY'VE CHEWED ANOTHER HOLE IN THE LEVEE. AND EVERY YEAR WE'RE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR THEM. WE NEVER GET 'EM. Y'ALL COME ON DOWN IN HERE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THEY NEED, THEY NEED A BULLET IN THEIR HEAD. DAD IS ON A MISSION. AND WE'RE ALL GONNA BE THERE TRYING TO GET THAT BEAVER. WHERE Y'ALL AT RIGHT NOW? COMING OVER, DO Y'ALL NEED ANYTHING? YOU BRING PLENTY OF MUSCLE AND BLOOD IN YOUR EYES. AND HEY, TELL THEM TO BRING ME SOME TEA, I'M RUNNING OUT. SI SAID BRING HIM SOME TEA. I'M DOWN TO THE LAST LITTLE SIP. WE FIXED TO OBLITERATE EVERY BEAVER AROUND HERE. THIS IS A BIG DEAL. THE WATER LEVELS CONTROL THE DUCKS. AND THE DUCKS CONTROL OUR HUNTING. AND OUR HUNTING CONTROLS OUR LIFE. ALL HANDS ON DECK. WHERE'S ALL THE WATER? THAT'S ALL WE GOT LEFT, UP HERE. THAT ONE LITTLE HOLE. WE GOT TO FIND THIS DAM, AND WE GOT TO KILL THESE BEAVERS. QUICK. LOOK AT THESE TRACKS. WAY MORE THAN ONE TOO. THAT'S A GROUP OF THEM. THAT'S A SMALL COLONY. A BEAVER IS ABOUT LIKE THE NINJAS. THE SUCKERS ONLY WORK AT NIGHT AND THEY'RE HARD TO FIND. THIS IS WHERE THEIR HOUSE WAS. HEH, LOOKIE HERE. THEY ATE YOUR BOARD. HOW MANY WOULD IT TAKE TO DO THAT? I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S A BELLYFUL OF TWO-BY-SIX. THAT SUCKER HAS SOME JAWS ON HIM. HE CAN GNAW THROUGH A TWO-BY-SIX LIKE A KNIFE GOING THROUGH BUTTER. HE'S THE SUPER-BEAVER. THAT IS A LOT OF DAMAGE IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THAT'S ALL I GOTTA SAY. I THINK THEY KNOW WHO I AM. THEY'VE DECLARED WAR ON YOU. YEAH, THEY DON'T LIKE YOU. IT IS PERSONAL. MAN AGAINST FURRY ANIMALS. I'LL WIN THE CONTEST BEFORE IT'S OVER. WE GOT TO KILL THESE SUCKERS IF IT'S THE LAST THING WE DO. IF WE FIND EVERY BEAVER DAM ON THE PROPERTY, LOAD IT WITH DYNAMITE, THAT WOULD BE A START. I BELIEVE YOU'RE RIGHT, SI. KILL THE BEAVERS. GOT TO KILL 'EM ALL! SO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I HEAR THIS, LIKE, BIG THUD. WILLIE GETS UP TO GO TO THE BATHROOM, TRIPS AND SLAMS HIS NOSE RIGHT INTO THE CLOSET DOOR. NO WAY! NO! MISS KAY, LADIES, HOW Y'ALL DOIN' TODAY? HI! SO GOOD TO SEE Y'ALL, HOW'S THE FOOD? THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE TO COME. THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING IN, WE APPRECIATE IT. YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANNA ASK YOU SOMETHING. HOW HARD IS IT TO RUN THIS RESTAURANT? WHY, ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RUNNING A RESTAURANT? KAY, YOU PRACTICALLY RUN A RESTAURANT ALREADY. IT'S AT YOUR HOUSE. DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE RUNNING A REAL RESTAURANT THOUGH? I WORKED IN A CHICKEN SHACK. FRY IT UP AND STICK IT OUT THE WINDOW AND THERE YOU GO, NOTHING BUT CHICKEN AND A ROLL. A CHICKEN SHACK? GO AHEAD AND TELL HIM WHAT YOU WANT, KAY. I WOULD LIKE SOME EXPERIENCE. REALLY? IN A REAL RESTAURANT. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'M CLOSED ON SUNDAYS, MAYBE YOU COULD COME BY IN A COUPLE WEEKS AND I'LL GIVE YOU A SHOT. I CAN DO IT. WHEN I HEAR AN OPPORTUNITY, I JUMP AT IT. I WANNA BE THERE THIS SUNDAY. I CAN RUN THIS RESTAURANT THIS SUNDAY. THIS SUNDAY? KAY, THAT'S TOMORROW. IT YOU REALLY WANNA DO IT, THE KEYS ARE YOURS. HOW ABOUT THAT? THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. I GOT MYSELF A RESTAURANT. YOU KNOW WHAT A BEAVER'S PROBLEM IS? HE BRINGS A PADDLE TO A GUNFIGHT. BOYS, ONE THING I LEARNED IN VIETNAM... WHAT IS THAT? IT'S MAKING ME NERVOUS. YOU GOTTA GET THINGS OUT OF HOLES... YOU GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING... IS THAT A CANDLE? CAN SMOKE THEM OUT AND NAPALM THEM. SI'S OUR SECRET WEAPON, SINCE HE HAS A MILITARY BACKGROUND. HE'S A HANDY MAN TO HAVE AROUND. YOU JUST HAVE TO CHANNEL HIS AGGRESSION. WE'RE GONNA GET 'EM ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AND INSANITY. THESE ARE HOMEMADE BOMBS, SON. IS THIS LEGAL TO MAKE YOUR OWN BOMBS THOUGH? NO. SI WITH NAPALM CAUSES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONSTERNATION. THAT'LL SEND A SHIVER DOWN ANYBODY'S BACK. HEY, I CAME PREPARED. HEY, LOOK HERE, BEAVERS, YOU BETTER HIDE YOUR WIVES, HIDE YOUR HUSBANDS, AND LOOK HERE, BOTH OF YOU HIDE YOUR KIDS, 'CAUSE WE'RE COMING. ALL RIGHT, BOYS... HEY! WE'RE TAKING NO PRISONERS!

SPINNIN' THEIR BALLS. ON THEIR PAWS. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE COMING OUT HERE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO THIS THING AT NIGHT. I THINK THE MORE DUCK RECIPES THE BETTER. THERE ARE SOME FRIED DUCKS IN HERE. SOME LITTLE FRIED FINGER. YUM. LIKE DUCK FINGERS, FRIED? YEAH, THAT'LL BE GOOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE CHEF ERIC'S GONNA REALLY LET ME RUN A RESTAURANT.

WHEN YOU LOOK AT US, YOU'RE NOT THINKING "I WANT THAT GUY PAWING MY FOOD AND THEN SERVING IT TO ME." LOOK AT US. WE'RE NOT RESTAURANT PEOPLE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS, GLUTEN... THEY'RE ORDERING STUFF THAT I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF. "OH, I'M A PESCETARIAN AND I'M RUNNING LOW ON MY GLUTEN AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR THAT?" HOW ABOUT A KICK IN THE PANTS? LOOK AT THAT, RED. YEP.

HEY, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IS THAT ALL OF THEM? IS THAT THE LAST OF IT? THAT WAS IT. THE GRILL IS OFFICIALLY CLOSED. ARE YOU GONNA GET IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS, KAY? NO, THANK YOU. THANK GOODNESS. WHOO! I LOVE A KITCHEN, BUT IT'S TIME TO LET THE LIGHTS GO OUT AS THEY SAY. BACK TO YOUR OWN KITCHEN. BUT WE GOT PLENTY OF LEFTOVERS, LET'S TAKE THEM ALL HOME AND HAVE A FAMILY DINNER. WE GOTTA FIND PHIL. HE'S STILL ON THEM BEAVERS. OH, MY GOODNESS. I WONDER HOW MANY HE KILLED? HE PROBABLY BURNT THE WHOLE WOODS DOWN. YEE-HAW! BURN, BABY, BURN. HEY, RED, I LIKE MY BEAVER FRIED. WE PRAY FATHER THAT WE LOVE YOU MORE EACH DAY AND THANKS FOR THIS GREAT FOOD AGAIN. AMEN. All: AMEN. ALL RIGHT, DIG IN. THE ROBERTSON FAMILY AND BAD IDEAS GO TOGETHER LIKE BISCUITS AND JAM. PHIL HAD TO FIND THEM BEAVERS. KAY HAD TO RUN A RESTAURANT. AND SI HAD TO PLAY A RECORDING OF HIMSELF TAKING A BATH TO ATTRACT BEAVERS. EXCUSE ME, I JUST THREW UP IN MY MOUTH A LITTLE BIT. BUT IF THERE'S ANY BRIGHT SPOT HERE, IT'S THAT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE A BAD IDEA WILL PAY OFF. IT HASN'T YET. BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN IT FINALLY DOES. IN THE MEANTIME, I'LL TRY TO BE MORE OPEN TO MY FAMILY'S STUPID IDEAS. HEY, WILLIE, COME ON. WE NEED TO DESIGN A BEAVER CALL. THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.
