 THAT'S EXACTLY WHO YOU NEED TO GET OUT HERE. GET THESE GRANDKIDS OUT HERE. WELL, NEXT TIME, WE'LL GET OLD JOHN LUKE TO HELP US. WE'LL SHOW HIM HOW TO HANDLE WOMANHOOD, EYEBALL TO EYEBALL. MEET THE ROBERTSON CLAN. THEY TURN DUCK CALLS... INTO A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR EMPIRE. BUT RUNNING A FAMILY BUSINESS IS TOUGH WHEN THE FAMILY JUST WANTS TO RUN WILD. ♪ ♪♪ SILK SUIT, BLACK TIE ♪ ♪ I DON'T EVEN NEED ♪ ♪ A REASON WHY ♪ ♪ THEY COME RUNNIN' ♪ ♪ JUST AS FAST AS THEY CAN ♪ ♪ 'CAUSE EVERY GIRL CRAZY ♪ ♪ 'BOUT A SHARP DRESSED MAN ♪ I HAVE A HUGE MEETING TODAY WITH ONE OF MY BIGGEST CLIENTS. FORTUNATELY, THERE ARE PERKS TO BEING A CEO. I MEAN, CARS GO FAST. HELICOPTERS GO WAY FASTER. WHEN WE HAVE THESE BIG MEETINGS, CLIENTS EXPECT TO SEE PHIL. HE IS THE MICHAEL JORDAN TO DUCK HUNTING. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO HE IS, THEY KNOW THE BEARD, THEY KNOW THE HAIR. PHIL IS THE KING, AND IF MY DAD AIN'T HOME, I PRETTY MUCH KNOW WHERE I CAN FIND HIM. A BEAVER'S KIND OF LIKE A BAD DISEASE... OH, YEAH. THAT JUST WON'T GO AWAY. THEY DO THEIR DIRTY WORK AT NIGHT. SO YOU COME BACK HERE IN THE MORNING, AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE AIN'T EVEN BEEN HERE. YEAH. CITY FOLK THINK THAT THESE BEAVERS ARE CUTE AND CUDDLY LITTLE ANIMALS, BUT I'LL TELL YOU, THEY ARE DESTRUCTIVE CRITTERS. THEY DAM UP THE RIVERBED, THEY KILL ALL THE TIMBER... WITH THESE LITTLE TEETH OF THEIRS. I'M IN A CONSTANT RUNNING BATTLE WITH BEAVERS. THESE RASCALS NEVER QUIT, BUT I GOT NEWS FOR THEM. WE DON'T EITHER. I'M A LOW-TECH MAN IN A HIGH-TECH WORLD, BASICALLY. WILLIE TOOK THE WHOLE THING WAY FURTHER THAN I EVER WOULD. I DON'T EVEN THINK YOU NEED A RAZOR. I DON'T EVEN THINK YOU NEED A RAZOR. WE WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME TILL WILLIE SHOWED UP WITH THAT STUPID CHOPPER. NOW I WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM GO. BACK TO QUIET TRANQUILITY OF THE WOODS. WILLIE, YOUR PRODUCTS ARE FLYING OFF OUR SHELVES RIGHT NOW. IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT. I KNOW THAT. I WANT MORE OF IT. THINK YOU ALL CAN HANDLE SOME MORE BUSINESS? ALWAYS READY FOR THAT. WALKING INTO THE MEETING WITH HANK, THIS IS WHAT I LIVE FOR. THIS IS WHERE THE SWAMP MEETS CORPORATE AMERICA. WE'RE GOING TO INCREASE YOUR LINE IN OUR STORES ACROSS THE BOARD... A LOT. WHAT'S "A LOT"? TEN TIMES WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH YOU. T-SHIRTS, YOUR CDs, DVDs. DUCK CALLS. FULL LINE. ANYTHING THAT... FULL LINE ACROSS THE BOARD. THIS IS A GAME CHANGER. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT OUR COMPANY HAS TO DO TO GROW. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT? WE GOT IT. WHAT KIND OF AUTOMATION YOU GOT IN YOUR SHOP? WE'RE... I WAS JUST FIXIN' TO PUT IN SOME NEW... JUST FIXIN'? AUTOMATED... YEAH. JUST FIXIN'S NOT... NO, THAT'S A BAD WORD. I CAN HAVE YOUR ORDER TOMORROW IF YOU WANT IT. EVERY STORE. YEAH. THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. PHIL, WE READY? WHEN IT COMES TO BUSINESS, I ZONE IT OUT. THEY CAN GET ME OUT OF THE WOODS FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT THE TOUGH PART IS GETTING THE WOODS OUT OF ME. WHEN ARE WE GETTING OUT OF HERE? WE BETTER GET DOWN THERE ON THE FLOOR AND BUILD A FIRE UNDER SOME FAT BOYS, I KNOW. WHAT DO YOU SAY, WILL? DID I REALLY SAY TOMORROW? OH, LOOK AT THAT STRAGGLING. GENTLEMEN. WHAT'S UP? THE BOSS IS BACK. I GOT REALLY GOOD NEWS. WE GET THE DAY OFF. CLOSE. ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CLIENTS... HE UPPED HIS ORDER TIMES TEN. THAT'S GOOD NEWS. THAT'S MORE WORK. GOOD POINT. Y'ALL PAY ATTENTION. I'VE BEEN THINKING, GUYS. I'VE BEEN THINKING. HERE'S THE WORD. SYNERGY. ANYBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS? WELL, IT'S KIND OF LIKE ENERGY. INCORRECT, MOUNTAIN MAN. SYNERGY IS EVERYTHING WORKING TOGETHER. THIS IS NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT. WE GOT TO LOOK MORE PROFESSIONAL. THESE ARE NAME TAGS, SO PEOPLE WALKED IN, YOU'D SAY, "HEY, JEP. HEY, JASE." I'M YOUR BROTHER. IT'S A FAMILY BUSINESS. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT WHEN PEOPLE COME IN, WE WANT TO PRESENT THAT IMAGE. I'M PUTTING MINE ON MY HAT. WE'RE GOING UPSIDE DOWN. WELL, PEOPLE ACT LIKE THEY KNOW YOU, AND THEY DON'T. WELL, THAT'S OKAY. NOW THEY KNOW YOUR NAME. THAT'S JUST ONE THING. EVERYBODY STAND UP. HAND ME YOUR CHAIR, MOUNTAIN MAN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE, ANYWAY? OH, I WAS JUST HANGING OUT. WORK'S SLOW RIGHT NOW. OKAY. SEE, HE DOESN'T WORK HERE. HERE'S THE PROBLEM. CHAIR, GONE. HE GONE... WORKERS WORK WAY HARDER WHEN THEY'RE STANDING UP, AND THEY'RE ON THEIR FEET. THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD WAY TO DECREASE PRODUCTIVITY. NO, NO, NO. THIS WILL INCREASE... ALL RIGHT, GUYS. WELL LOOK, WE CAN'T DO TEN TIMES WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THIS PACE. Y'ALL CAN BARELY GET DONE WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING NOW. FOR DUCK COMMANDER TO EVER GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL, WE HAVE GOT TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS. SO WE NEED TO GET MORE AUTOMATED. I NEED ONE GUY PASSING OFF TO THE NEXT GUY, THEN HE'S TO THE NEXT GUY. AND IT'S JUST MOVING DOWN THE LINE. LIKE A CONVEYOR BELT? LIKE A CONVEYOR BELT. A CONVEYOR BELT? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WILLIE'S TALKING ABOUT. WHAT WILLIE NEEDS TO DO IF HE WANTS TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE IS FIRE ALL OF US. EVERYBODY ON THEIR FEET. SYNERGY, SYNERGY, SYNERGY. ALL RIGHT, BACK TO WORK. NOBODY'S SITTING DOWN EITHER. HMM. WILLIE GONE WILD. AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH. OKAY, JOHN LUKE. THESE ARE A FEW MORE OF THE SQUIRRELS THAT I'M GOING TO DO RIGHT HERE. DON'T YOU LIKE THE LOOKS OF THIS ONE? LOOK AT THAT. PUT PLENTY OF FLOUR. YOU WANT IT TO STICK ON, SO YOU WON'T LOSE THE... WHO IS THAT? HEY, BABE. WHERE'VE YOU BEEN ALL DAY? WELL, WE'VE BEEN, UH, BUSTING OUT SOME BEAVER DAMS. WE WORKED UP A BIG HUNGER. OKAY, YOU ARE NOT EATING THIS FOOD. THERE ARE FEW THINGS IN THIS WORLD THAT I LOVE MORE THAN MISS KAY'S COOKING. LOOK AT THIS. LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST COMING OUT OF THE SWAMP. NOW, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. SHE ENDED UP A BETTER COOK THAN MY MAMA. IF YOUR WOMAN COOKS BETTER THAN YOUR MAMA, YOU GOT ONE. BETTER HOLD ONTO HER. SON, YOU'RE YOUNG. LET ME SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THIS. BUDDY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE'RE PUTTING IT IN A BOWL, AIN'T WE? LOOK, YOU CAN'T EAT MUCH OF THAT. WHEN I GET DONE HERE, YOU'LL NEVER KNOW I'VE BEEN THERE. NO. PHIL, LOOK HOW MUCH YOU'RE GETTING. I LOVE SQUIRREL. SQUIRREL HAS A FLAVOR ALL OF ITS OWN, WHICH IS A GREAT FLAVOR. I'VE NEVER EATEN MANY OTHER RODENTS. EVERY TIME I COOK LIKE THIS, Y'ALL JUST COME IN AND WIPE IT ALL OUT. I MEAN, JUST... MM. SQUIRREL BRAINS MAKE YOU SMART. THAT'S WHERE YOU GET SMART, FROM THE SQUIRREL BRAINS. I LOVE A WOMAN WHO LOVES SQUIRREL BRAINS. THAT'S OUR SECRET. MISS KAY IS A KIND, GENTLE WOMAN. I JUST TOUCHED THE HEAD, AND IT FELL OFF. KIND AND GENTLE. I TELL YOU WHAT, THAT'S AS FINE AS I'VE EVER PUT IN MY MOUTH RIGHT THERE. WELL, Y'ALL NEED TO GET THROUGH EATING, AND Y'ALL GO BACK HUNTING. HOW ABOUT THAT? LET'S TAKE JOHN LUKE WITH US. WE'RE GOING TO TRAIN HIM TO FIND HIM A SQUIRREL-EATING WOMAN. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? YEAH. I WOULD CONSIDER IT AN OBLIGATION TO MY GRANDKIDS TO SHOW THEM THE GREAT OUTDOORS, AS THEY SAY. THE LAST THING I WOULD WANT FOR MY GRANDKIDS IS THAT THEY GROW UP TO BE NERDS. YOU'RE THE BEST, GRANDMA KAY. MM-HMM. YOU BRING HOME THE GAME, OR YOU'RE NOT A MAN. THAT'S WHAT I SAY. HOW IN THE HECK ARE WE GONNA GET THIS DONE? I THINK OF ALL THE THINGS HE DISCUSSED, THE CONVEYOR BELT WAS THE ONE THAT STUCK OUT IN MY HEAD. AND IT'S JUST MOVING DOWN THE LINE. LIKE A CONVEYOR BELT? LIKE A CONVEYOR BELT. WELL, WHERE IN THE WORLD DO YOU BUY A CONVEYOR BELT? WELL, LET'S JUST BUILD IT. FORGET BUYING IT. WE GOT THE TOOLS OVER HERE. I GOT IT IN MY HEAD. YOU GIVE A BUNCH OF REDNECKS WOOD, TOOLS, SCREWS, AND NAILS, AND THEY CAN BUILD ANYTHING. IT MAY NOT BE THE PRETTIEST ANYTHING, BUT I GUARANTEE THAT OLD DOG WILL HUNT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL ACTUALLY IMPROVE THINGS AROUND HERE. IT AIN'T GONNA HURT THINGS. A CONVEYOR BELT? THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG. I'M IN. IT AIN'T GOTTA BE STRAIGHT. THAT'S JUST A SUGGESTION. CUT RIGHT THERE. MM-HMM. THAT LOOKS GOOD. WORK IT, WORK IT. THAT'S IT. WELL, BOYS, I THINK WE DID IT. LOOKS GOOD. GOT TO LOVE IT WHEN A PLAN COMES TOGETHER. THAT THING LOOKS FACTORY-BUILT. MOUNTAIN MAN, IT WAS ALL DUE TO YOUR HAMMERING SKILLS. WELL, HOW'S IT GOING TO RUN? MOUNTAIN MAN. FIRE IT UP! ALL RIGHT. UH-OH. UH-OH. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WE GOT A LITTLE MOVEMENT. WE GOT A LITTLE MOVEMENT. HERE WE GO. OH, YEAH. YEAH, IT'S WORKING. COME ON, LET'S GET TO WORK. I WOULD SAY WE HAVE SUCCESS ON OUR HANDS. AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY WILLIE IS THE CEO. WILLIE'S GOING TO BE FIRED UP ABOUT THIS. GENIUS. IT'S WORKING, BOYS. WE GOT SOMETHING GOING NOW. AND HERE WE WERE, THINKING YOU WERE DUMB. TEN BOXES? WE'RE GETTING A BOX A MINUTE. NOW THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. I THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY GO FASTER. I THINK I CAN GIVE IT SOME MORE GAS IF YOU WANT. CRANK IT UP. YOU KNOW, I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF PRODUCT TESTING. WHAT IF WE JUST PUT THE BOX AT THE END AND PUT THE PRODUCTS ON THE BELT? THAT'S FINE WITH ME. I MEAN, IF WE'RE GONNA BE AS GOOD AS WE CAN BE, WE GOT TO SEE WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH. GO. CRANK IT UP! WHOO! NOTHING TO IT, BOYS. OH, WILLIE'S GONNA LIKE THIS. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, GIVE US OUR JOBS. LET'S GO. WHY DON'T YOU START WITH THE DVDs? OKAY. MISSY, IF YOU CAN GET THE HATS? OKAY. NORMALLY, I DON'T GET THE GIRLS OUT TO ACTUALLY HELP US PUT ORDERS TOGETHER, BUT WITH AN ORDER THIS BIG, I NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK. WHOO, THIS IS GONNA BE A GOOD ONE. I KNOW. I ALWAYS KNEW THAT IF WE COULD HIT AN ORDER LIKE THIS, IT CHANGES EVERYTHING. YUP. I'M GONNABACK IN MY OFFICE, RUN SOME MORE NUMBERS. WE GOT IT, WE GOT THIS. I'LL BE BACK. GOOD DEAL. ALL RIGHT, MORE DVDs. ALL RIGHT, JOHN LUKE. NOW SEE, I'M LOOKING AT YOU. AND YOUR FACE BE BRIGHT WHITE. BUT LOOKEE HERE. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A LITTLE OF THIS. YOU SEE MY FACE? MM. MAKE YOUR FACE LOOK LIKE MY FACE. YOU GOT A LITTLE CHICK YOU'RE DATING? I DO. I DO. HOW MUCH MAKEUP IS ON THERE? NOT MUCH. THAT'S A GOOD THING. THE THICKER IT GETS, THE MORE THEY'RE TRYING TO HIDE. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WHAT'S INSIDE HER HEAD, NOT WHAT'S ON THE OUTSIDE OF IT. YES, SIR. SO YOU CAN GET ALL DOLLED UP, BUT SHE MAY BE MEAN AS A SNAKE. LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY... THAT MAKEUP COULD COVER UP A LOT OF EVIL, MY MAN. YOU DON'T WANT NO EVIL WOMAN. SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? YES, SIR. LET'S GO GET MISS KAY SOME SQUIRRELS. WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ROBERTSON FAMILY, YOU TAKE A BOY HUNTING, YOU'RE TRYING TO TEACH HIM A FEW THINGS. TRY NOT TO STEP ON ANY STICKS. ONE OF THE THINGS IS TO KILL DELICIOUS MEAT. THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE. GOOD SHOT, JOHN LUKE. YOU GOT HIM. WE TEACH THEM THE VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LIFE, MANHOOD. SHE COULD BE AN UGLY WOMAN, BUT IF SHE COOKS SQUIRREL AND DUMPLINGS, THAT'S THE WOMAN YOU GO AFTER. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE TEACH 'EM IS HOW TO BE A ROBERTSON. 15, 20. LET 'EM GO. IF YOU CATCH SQUIRRELS FOR YOUR WOMAN... YOUR WOMAN WILL NEVER CUT YOU OFF IN BED. JOHN LUKE, YOU SEE THAT RIGHT THERE? YES, SIR. THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF A BIG BEAVER DAM. RIGHT ON DOWN THIS THING, THERE'S A BIG ONE SOMEWHERE. I THINK IT'S RIGHT DOWN THROUGH HERE. THE BEAVER WAR. NO MATTER HOW MANY YOU GET RID OF, THEY JUST KEEP COMING. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. GOOD GRACIOUS, ALIVE. WHAT IN THE WORLD? THAT'S THE PRIZE OF THE DAY. SI FORGOT TO COME BACK DOWN HERE AND GET RID OF THAT ONE. I FINALLY NEED TO PUT THE MILITARY ON THIS. BOOM, BOOM. BLOW THAT SUCKER OUT OF THERE. LOOKS LIKE THE HUNT'S OVER. HEY. UH-OH. THAT CONVEYOR BELT IDEA OF WILLIE'S? IT ACTUALLY WASN'T A BAD IDEA. THINGS ARE JUST FLYING OFF THE ASSEMBLY LINE. WHAT ABOUT A MAN? WHOO! WHAT ABOUT MOUNTAIN MAN IN THE BOAT? ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU READY? I'M GONNA LET HER RIP. HERE WE GO. NIAGARA FALLS. YOU READY? YEAH. ALL RIGHT, JASE, FIRE IT UP. HEY! WHAT IN THE WORLD? WHAT IS THIS? I DON'T WANT TO BRAG, BUT I THINK IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE THINGS I'VE EVER BEEN IN CHARGE OF... THE BUILDING OF THE CONVEYOR BELT. WELL, I'M READY TO RUN FOR POLITICAL OFFICE AFTER THAT. YOU GOT, LIKE, FOUR BOXES DONE. WE GOT TO HAVE 15 TIMES THAT. THE FIVE STOOGES ARE AT IT AGAIN. I MEAN, IT'S LIKE SPOON-FEEDING FIVE, CRYING, OVERWEIGHT, BEARDED BABIES WITH FULL DIAPERS. POOPY DIAPERS. WE JUST GOT TO GET BACK TO WORK. I MEAN, WE... Y'ALL AIN'T GOT CRAP DONE. GET THE BOXES OUT. THIS, I DON'T LIKE. THAT, I DEFINITELY DON'T LIKE. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE READY. COME ON, LET'S GO. WE'RE READY. WORK, WORK, WORK. JUST WHEN IT WAS GETTING GOOD. HEY, BABE. WHAT'S WRONG? WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THIS DONE. YES, WE ARE. WE'RE DOING GOOD. I GOT THE GUYS OUT THERE DOING NOTHING. WHAT DO YOU MEAN "DOING NOTHING?" GOOFING OFF. I LEFT THEM, SAID, LOOK... THE GUYS ARE GOOFING OFF? THIS IS THE BIGGEST ORDER WE GOT. I THOUGHT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE MESSAGE. I GO OUT THERE, IT'S JUST A CIRCUS. WHAT? WHAT DID YOU DO? I FIRED EVERY ONE OF THEM. WAIT. WAIT, WHAT? I SHOULD HAVE. REALLY? THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO US, BUT BECAUSE OF THEM IDIOTS... LUNCH IS HERE. LUNCH, IT IS. KAY, I'M NOT EVEN HUNGRY. YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY? NO, I CAN'T EVEN STAY, AND I CAN'T EVEN EAT. WHY? I'M SORRY. BECAUSE THE WHOLE THING'S FALLING APART. WE GOT THE BIGGEST ORDER EVER... HOW BIG IS IT? TEN TIMES WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR. WE AND DADDY USED TO HAVE STUFF LIKE THIS. KAY, YOU AND DADDY HAD, LIKE, 12 ORDERS DOWN AT THE TICKTOCK INN FOR SIX DUCK CALLS. NO, WE DID NOT. I MEAN, I DON'T THINK MOM UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE. THIS IS A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY. IT'S NOT A MOM-AND-POP COMPANY ANYMORE. TIMES ARE CHANGING, AND THE OLD WAYS, THEY AIN'T GONNA WORK ANYMORE. I NEED, LIKE, 100 PEOPLE UP HERE TO GET THIS THING DONE. WHERE THERE'S A WILL, THERE'S A WAY. WELL, WILL AIN'T GETTING HIS WAY, SO IF YOU CAN GET 100 PEOPLE UP HERE, I'M ALL EARS. JOHN LUKE, WHEN I TELL YOU, YOU PUSH THAT PLUNGER DOWN AND WATCH THE ACTION. THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL PAYBACK TIME. YOU DO THE HONORS. YOU GOT IT? YES, SIR. I CAN DO THIS. GET IT DONE. BLOW IT. GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM! NOW THAT'S THE WAY TO TAKE A BEAVER DAM OUT, BOYS. WHOA. THAT'S IT? THAT'S IT. OH, MAN. ME AND MY BIG IDEAS, AND MY BIG MOUTH. WE JUST NEED MORE TIME. THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD'VE SAID. SURPRISE! HEY. WHAT IS THIS? I GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU. DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE USED TO DO THOSE OLD-TIMEY PACKING PARTIES? YEAH? REMEMBER MY MOTTO? EAT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN EAT... NO. I'M GONNA WHIP YOU. WHEN YOU FEED THEM, THEY WILL COME. A PACKING PARTY? THEY'RE COMING. 100 PEOPLE... TO WORK. ARE YOU KIDDING? THERE THEY ARE. OH, MY LORD. Y'ALL WOULD'VE BEEN IN A BIND OR THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT THE BIG GUNS IN. CHANGE IS A GOOD THING, BUT SOMETIMES, YOU GOT TO GO BACK TO THE BASICS. IT'S JUST BEEN MY OBSERVATION THAT IN THE END, THE OLD-SCHOOL WAYS, THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO WORK OUT. WILLIE WILL FIGURE ALL THAT STUFF OUT ONE OF THESE DAYS. HE'S IN HIS 40s. HE'S JUST A YOUNG BUCK. OH, WE ARE ROLLING. WHY IS IT THAT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WORK WHEN EVERYBODY'S DOING IT? Y'ALL CAN EAT SOME PIG. NOW WE'RE GETTING IT. NOW WE'RE WORKING. WELL, MOM. I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU PULLED THIS OFF. PUTTING THE TAPE ON THE LAST ONE. ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY. I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT, HELPING US GET THIS ORDER DONE. MOST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK KAY FOR ALL HER HARD WORK IN GETTING THIS THING TOGETHER. AS WE GROW AS A COMPANY, WE CAN'T FORGET WHAT GOT US HERE. AND I FIND MYSELF REMINDED OF THAT. DIG IN. THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE THE COMPANY NEEDS TO BE BECAUSE THESE ARE MY PEOPLE... THE SAME PEOPLE THAT WILL ALWAYS HELP ME OUT. I GUESS THE NEW WAYS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THE BEST WAYS. BUT IN THE END, WE NEED TO ALWAYS REMEMBER WHERE WE CAME FROM.
