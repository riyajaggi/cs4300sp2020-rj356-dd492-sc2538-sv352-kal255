 I said, you know, I can't even get high off your coke, Richie. You sell shit, I pay shit. Guess he didn't like getting told. Asshole thinks siccing his dog on you's gonna make me sweat. Yeah well it made me sweat. I took care of it, didn't I? You ran over his dog, Mom. That's cold. Yeah, to save you! I'm grateful. Until he murders me after school. Come here. I'll kill and die for you, Jelly Bean. Hey! Don't ever forget it! All right. I've got your assignments here from last week. Excellent work. Very well done. Really good job, Caleb. Tyler, not your best work. Yo, Jared. I expect more from you. Don't you smell pretty. Pretty fucked up. You really need to slow down and focus Ryan. You can do better, Jared. I want you to see the Guidance Counsellor. Crackers for your mini cucumbers? Sure, go crazy, man. You ride your bike today? Mhm. You think I could borrow it after school? I've got a really early shift at work and I-I can't be late. Sure, I got my Game On group after class anyway. You know Game On? Hey, you should come by, dude. Maybe we'd team up like back in the day. Remember when we used to play friggen- Hey man, shoo! Me and Jared got grown up matters to discuss. You don't own the hallways, Dylan. Pretty sure I do. Hey, working later? Need some of those extra salty fries. Yeah, come by any time after six. All right, it's a date. It's a date. Crashpad. What kinda dweeb makes up his own nickname, man? It's my gamer tag. Okay, okay, so it's kinda like- Crashbang. Hey man, back off if you want those extra salty fries you like so much, eh? All right. All right, all right. Nice talking to ya. Asspad. Ah, Crashmat, ah, whatever. What a douchebag. I'm sorry, man. It's fine. Princess at Fanny's, she always gives me a free lap dance. I don't pay for shit when I go there. It's so unfair.

I'm not fighting you. Fight, fight! Woo! Beer for your loss. Woo! I birthed that kid in the back of my truck. Mom, when you hear the timer go off, take the tray out of the oven. Mom, don't forget. You almost burnt the place down last time. I heard you. Yeah you fucking did, Maggie. No I didn't. Yeah you did! I love you, Jelly Bean. What's up, man. Jared. Hey, Dad. You're just in time. Beer and crib. Can't, I gotta go to work. Aw, come in for a sec, I could use the company. That's uh for rent, plus, uh, there's a little extra. Groceries and clothes, you know, but nothing else, Dad. Shit, no. I'm not taking painkillers anymore, you know that. Thanks. Its just til I get back on my feet. Yeah I know. I'm working on getting my social worker to, uh, increase my disability cheques, so. Hey Destiny. We, uh, tied one on last night. Destiny can't keep up with the old man. The only woman that ever could was your mom. She was something else, eh. Hey, she doesn't know you're helping me out, does she? No, no. If she found out she would kill me. Yeah. Yeah, you and me both. I'd like to pay for these please, cash. I'll pay the hydro bill later. - Hi, welcome to - Tasty Bucket. Can I take your order please? Yeah, gimme a three-piece meal, onion rings, and a coke? That'll be $15.59, drive up, please. There you go. Sorry it's all in change. So Jared, you working hard or hardly working? Yeah, we actually added a extra sauce just 'cause you're a regular and we, we appreciate your business. Well I appreciate the service. You're not one of the lazy ones. Thanks, have a great one. Hey, welcome to Tasty Bucket. Can I take your order please? Large root beer, nuggets, extra salty fries. Extra salty fries? Yeah, dude, extra salty fries. Okay, that'll be, uh, $9.70. Please drive up. Tasty bro. What's going on Ja-ron? Not much, man. Here's your, uh, order, sir. Holy moly, molly! Enjoy, man. You know it. - Hi, welcome to - Tasty Bucket. Can I take your order please? You just shit yourself. Listen, do yourself a favour kid. Talk sense into that bat-shit crazy mom of yours. Hey! Yeah, that'll be, uh, 450- 450? Oh, you mean two grand. That's what your bitch mom owes me. Matter of fact, let's round it up to three. Cover the cost of my dead dog. How's that? Three grand, three days. Or the next dead bitch lying in a ditch is gonna be your mommy. Shit. Hey. You are shitting me. You're in town right now. No, no, no, you're gonna come and stay with me. Yeah, we're gonna throw a party. No you bit the bag. - Okay. Yeah, no, great. - I'll talk to you later. Bye. Now that was a blast from the past. That was my buddy- Is everything okay? Yeah, uh, the extra cash I gave you. Could I have some of it back? Jared! Close your eyes and hold out your hand. Wait, why? Duh, a surprise. Do it. I'm pregnant! Ugh, please tell me you washed this! That's why you were sick the other morning? Not because you were hungover? You're gonna be an uncle! I think you mean brother. Uh, you know, forget I asked about the money. It-it's all good. Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah it's all good. If that's the case, uh, do you think you could help a guy out? I've got a baby to look after now. Yeah, I'll-I'll see what I can do. It's been a while, Jared. How are things? You know, same. Mhm. Friends? Some. Girl? No. How's home? Uh, it's fine. It's been about a year since your parents separated right? Yeah, I guess so. You know, I don't really think about it too much. Tell me something. Do you think your parents' separation has anything to do with your mediocre grades? Because, I'm not gonna lie Jared, I am concerned. Jared! Hey. Yeah, uh, I just got a C+ on my Chem paper, you know. That's-that's good enough. Mm, yeah, maybe for the average student. But you're smarter than most men, yet you continually take home the prize for most aspiring underachiever. So, why do you think that is, hm? Just think what you could do if you actually applied yourself. Like really, really think about that right now. Okay? Here. Take that and squeeze it and release any of this tension that's stopping you from- from seizing your path, man! Come on! Squeeze the ball. Okay? I want you to squeeze the ball, okay. Now close your eyes. Now, where do you see yourself in five years? You know, I don't. I don't. Oh shit. Does the Whitesail Route stop here? No I don't think so. Huh, it used to. Yeah, more things change, more they stay the same. You grew up here then? I don't like this colour. Do you like this colour? Fred is that you? Just kidding. You were at Phil's, weren't you? No, but even if I was, I'm not allowed to go see my dad? You know your dad's a user? He's off the oxy. That's not what I'm talking about. You giving him money, hm? No, you know what? I know- You're cute. Come to Dylan's party this weekend. You can sell your happy pills and make everybody feel happy. I'll introduce you around. You'd do that? For you, I would. Definitely. What the hell's going on? Mom, these are my friends. I'll show you how to play a real drinking game. Woohoo! Russian roulette. Six shooters. The shooter with the vodka is the bullet. Bam bam bam bam bam! Yo Jared, your mom is lit! Line 'em up. There we go. All right. Last night was a blast. My friends seemed to like you more than me. Learn how to hold your drink better. So that Richie guy, is he for real? Why you bringing him up? Got enough of a fucking headache without you adding that prick to the mix. Just asking if he's for real or if he's just talk. Told ya I'd take care of it. Where you going? Work. Call in sick. We'll order Chinese and watch bad movies. Not with no money we won't. Mom! Oooph. I hope you hit him harder. It's nothing. Where are the tweezers? Where are the tweezers? Fuck, I need tweezers. Oh, take that! Sniped them all in one shot! That gun is probably worth like 300 bucks. If I sold my account it'd be worth ten times that. At least. That's a better profit margin than dealing E. Doubt it. You know how long it took me to get my character this good, dude? Years. Jared, so nice to see you again. It's nice to be back, Mrs. Robinson. You're welcome to stay for supper. Mom, we can't pause the game. All right. Anytime. Thank you! Your mom's so nice. Yeah, I just think she's happy that you're here. She doesn't really like it when I'm gaming out alone. But, you know, I'm just laying low. Yeah, I should do the same. What's going on? Got rolled. All my dope and cash, it's just gone. Shit, dude. Well do you know who it was? Probably my mom's dealer, Richie. She owes him like three grand. But it didn't look like Richie. Who was it? Ugh, I've been seeing some weird shit lately. Probably just tripping from too much shit or something. Either that or- Crazy's hereditary, right? Jelly Bean! What's up? I'm toasted. I need a coffee to level me out. No, not here. No, get out of here. I won't cause any trouble. Just get me a coffee. I'll go sit in the corner. Shut up. I love you, thank you. Hey. You shut up. I already know I gotta stop doing this shit. I'm just kidding. Gotta fucking quit doing this shit, man. Gotta quit doing it. No. You! Son of a bitch! Mom, what are you doing? Mom! - Wait. No he, that was somebody else! Hey, I'm-I'm really sorry, sir. I'm really sorry - No! You need to leave, please leave! I swear! I- Fuck! My apologies, sir. - Hey man, I'm sorry. Sorry, man. This is not the first time your mom has caused shit. What the hell is her problem? I don't know why she does this, man. Please, I'm sorry. Tony, Tony. So am I! I'm gonna have to let you go. Oh no, no, no, I'm fired? Look, I like you, all right, Jared. But this can't keep happening. It's bad for business. Just finish off your shift, all right? I'm short staffed. What, is this your way of saying sorry? I could just dump it on you. Have you ever regret having me? What kind of a stupid question is that? Idiot. Haven't you ever wondered what your life would have been like without me? My life didn't exist before you, Jelly Bean. You ever regret having a crazy-ass mom? With anger management issues? What kind of stupid question is that? Idiot. Roast beef for dinner? We don't have any in the freezer. I'll buy some. Good cut too, none of that cheap-ass shit that you always buy. We don't have any money. Chill your cucumber. I'll work it out. Well have you worked it out with Richie yet? The world is hard. You have to be harder. I didn't Lizzie Borden anyone, if that's what you're thinking. Spoiled moose meat. Freezer conked out. You just moved in with the Jacks family? Yeah, it's a foster home. Yeah, I know. I just live across the street right there. I thought you had blue hair? I did. Life comes at you fast. True. So, uh, where you from? Foster kid. So what's this place like? It's, it's whatever, you know. Nothing to do, nothing going on. Unless you're an oil and gas worker. Did you know there's a direct link between the industrial exploitation of land and violence against Indigenous women? Wow, I did not know that. So, uh, how long you staying? This is my third foster home this year. Figure I'll be on to the next by Thanksgiving. Sooner if this place sucks. So you can just leave when you want? Can't you? Wait, what? Mom! Mom? Mom? - Want to go to - Dylan's party? No. Check it out, man. Come on. Cheers. There you are! I've been telling everyone about your amazing product. Yeah, thanks, but, I'm out. She wants you, bro. Whoa whoa whoa whoa, don't fight it, bro. Easy does it, breathe. What'd you take? Jared? You-you all right? Hey, he's tripping, all right? Get flushed, Maxi Pad. I got this. Weird, I just saw you in the kitchen. Dude! Our world is worth fighting for! I saw some crazy shit. I gotta quit mixing. Or just quit all together. What time is it? Almost noon. Can I borrow some cash? Dude, I got like 30 bucks to my name. That might do. How you gonna turn 30 bucks into three grand in a few hours? G53! Under the G, 53. O72. Under the O, 72. B13. Everyone's favourite, B13. For the lover birds, I29. Under the I, 29. N34. Under the N, 34. Give it up for G52. Thanks. Another B. Number 9. Bingo! Any luck? I don't know. I should've tried scratch and win. Scratch this. Where'd you get this? I robbed the Tasty Bucket. Came in there like that. What? Just kidding. I sold my account. Games, characters, rare items. It's all there. Three grand. Man, I can't take this. Dude, you gotta. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. I know. Why'd we quit hanging out? Shit got crazy when my parents split up. Crazier. Terminal's sure gonna change things around here. For good or for bad? Ugh, gross! His place should be just right around the corner. Whoa! Uh, your mom wouldn't kill Richie would she? No, my mom's crazy but not that crazy. Uh, I gotta get home. Mom! Mom! What are you doing on the floor? He milked himself. Hey, what's he doing here? Chill, everything's fine. Hey, your momma figured out a way to pay off her debts. You thought Richie came here to kill me? We got a little carried away in the kitchen. What happened to your place? Oh you saw that did you? I told Richie that if we, uh, torch his trailer, I can make it look like an accident. Sexy and conniving. I mean, Richie's gonna collect way more money in insurance than what I owed him. We're splitting it 50/50. Yeah, 60/40. 50/50 or I'll burn your truck too. Sold. Told ya I'd take care of it, Jelly Bean. Arson and insurance fraud to settle a drug debt? Guess there's some sick logic to it. Well if it's not already obvious, Richie is staying with us for a while. No god, are you serious? Yeah, well, thanks to your wild child mom, I ain't got no place to live anymore! Aren't you the sentimental one. Whoa! What's the matter? Never had a Corvus Corax talk to you before? No, you're not-you're not real. I'm tripping. No, you're not real, I'm tripping. Jared! Your time is almost up! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
