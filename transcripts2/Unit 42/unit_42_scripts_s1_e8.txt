 No more bottle. Look. Maybe this? No, done. There, all done. Come here. AN EYE FOR AN EYE It's Mother's Day. Yes. Who should I give my present to? To your dad. He'll be stoked. - Right? - Yeah. I have to go.

 See you later. See you, son. Pasta necklaces aren't for dads. We have to find a stepmom. Yeah. - Like in Snow White? - No, a nice one. What are you looking for? Someone who likes comics, especially Batman. - OK. - She has to teach me to do make-up. And know how to make good pancakes. In a nutshell: you want a nice, elegant, cultured woman who likes to cook. - Yes! - OK. Oh, fu...

 Here. What do we have? Raphaël Dickens, 37 years old, single. The smell alerted the neighbors who found him this morning. He's been dead for at least eight days. Tortured with a Taser. The Taser scorched his eyes. Raphaël Dickens. A regular forger for the Serbian mafia on the darknet. Arrested for fraud and trafficking. When he got arrested, did he snitch on anyone? No. Arrested six months ago for assault on a minor. But released due to a lack of evidence. Check the database to see if there are similar murders. I did and I got nothing. However... There are a lot of blank cell phones and passports. That's worth a fortune. Clearly, the motive wasn't money. Thanks. - Why scorch his eyes? - I don't know. Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have. How could someone do that to a computer? I don't get it. Ms. Wouters, hello. Samuel Leroy, Cyber Crime. I wanted to talk to you about a Raphaël Dickens. Could you call me back on 0458682213? Thanks. Dickens' laptop has been wiped clean. No way! - Are you on Clicker? - No, I've been hacked. - I've never signed up to that. - Right. Why not? It's cool. Seriously? Get rid of it for me. Swipe left if you're not into her, right if you are. You like her, you like her, you like her, you like her... You like her, you like her... It's not high on my priorities! A little action wouldn't hurt. - You'd be less of a pain. - That's enough. This is what I recovered from the SIM cards. What is this crap? Codes? Really? Did you check the database? It lists all the codes used by mafias. No result. We need more points of comparison to decrypt them. I've got friends in the crime unit. I'll see if they can help us out. Wanna see something funny? No! Hold on. That one's not bad. Oh, come on. Are you jealous? - No! - She's jealous. No, I'm not jealous! Yes, you are jealous. Whatever! That's enough. Back to work! PERSONAL FILE I have something. Old classifieds posted by Dickens on the darknet. He called himself Next Life Master. His messages all end in the same acronym. Maybe that's his signature: Next Life Master. How much time is needed to decrypt everything? A couple of days. Give me half an hour. Billie! What are you going to do? I know a big company that deals with that kind of stuff. OK. You hacked into the company and stole their program. No, that's your interpretation of it. - Hello. I've come to see Samuel Leroy. - Hello. Sam! There you go. Hello. Diane Wouters. You left me a message. Yes, please, come in. You didn't have to come here. - I was meeting a client nearby. - Have a seat. Is that Raphaël Dickens in the photos? Yes. You filed a suit against him, but there's nothing in the files. It's a way of protecting the underage victim. - Sandrine Forget? - Yes. Sexual assault. Rape. Attempted rape on a 12-year-old girl. Raphaël Dickens wasn't sentenced. Why? Insufficient evidence. The charges were dropped. - I'd like to talk to Sandrine Forget. - Why? I need to know her timetable. I'll get that to you. But read over the file again. That man was a criminal probably killed by someone like him. Bam! 26 minutes, 32 seconds! It's still stolen software. So? The last messages from Raphaël Dickens' GSM. "Need four PS, one photo, four names." - A buyer. - There! The buyer set up a meeting with Raphaël Dickens at a bar on the day he died. Billie. Geolocate Dickens' GSM at the time of the meeting. OK. He was there. Can you check if the buyer was also there? I'll pull up the IP addresses of other phones that were also there. OK. Try to see where the buyer is now. OK, we have him. Let's go. Hands in the air. Get out. Slowly. Let's go. "Gregor Vasichek... theft, burglary, violent armed robbery." Busy guy. "Really think about it, you might regret it." That's what I tell my daughter when she talks about tattoos. Robbery of a jewelers in Namur two weeks ago. Right. To recap: you kill the security guard, create a fake identity and then you kill the only person who could've connected both of you. What? What are you talking about? This. Torture and murder. Thirty years. That wasn't me! We know you bought the fake documents! I didn't kill him! I didn't kill him! I want a lawyer. Yeah. Go get yourself a really expensive one. Asshole. Hey! My software's awesome, right? Sam, he confessed. For the security guard. Not for Raphaël Dickens. - Why would he have tortured him? - You're the one torturing yourself. Could you geolocate Vasichek's cell at the time of the murder? I suppose I can't say no. Vasichek wouldn't have tortured him. He's too impatient. Did you see him? He'd settle it with a bullet to the head. Simonstraat, Anvers. - So, it's not him. - No. That's why he wouldn't give us an alibi. - He was robbing another jewelry store. - In Anvers. Did you do this? No need to thank me, bro. It's a gift. Take that app down, OK? When was your last relationship? Should I remind you what happened? Sam, you won't replace their mother, OK? But don't let it stop you dating! You'll go rusty. Take that down. It's a shame! There are some hot women. Who the kids would approve of. - You brought the kids into this? - Yeah! They were happy. They're not down about it. That's reckless. They're kids. - My kids. - I see them more than you do. Right. You're the good uncle and I'm the crappy dad. I didn't say that. I'm just helping you out. You just look after them, OK? I'm not your minion! I'm done. Figure it out for yourself! - Tom! - Find another slave. - Don't be stupid! - No, you don't be stupid! Is this your life now? Alone, depressed? I'm not depressed. Besides, I won't have time any more. I'll be doing castings. OK. Sorry. Yeah, you're always sorry. Dammit, Sam, do something! Don't leave me now, I need you. NEW MESSAGE She's a bit old. Fuck! - Can you stay a bit longer? - What's going on? Serial killer. Marc Descamps, 38, found by his wife, sat in front of his computer. I was having such a good time. A guy? No, three. Online games. I was about to thrash them, level 5. - He looks fresher than the other one. - When did he die? No more than four hours ago. Gregor Vasichek was with us. He didn't do this one either. She's gonna spend the whole night with that guy. Not a bad Clicker date! I was away for the weekend with the kids. At our country house. Your husband didn't go? No. No, he had work... He had an urgent case file. As usual. Why did you go back home? Marc? I had forgotten my medicine. I have diabetes. I got home and found him like that. Are you OK? Would you like to stop? No, it's fine. Sorry. Do you know this man? No. Raphaël Dickens. No, it doesn't ring a bell. Did your husband have any enemies? No. He was a good husband. He was a good father. What will I tell the children? RAPHAEL DICKENS 03/14/1980 CAUSE OF DEATH: TASER, TORTURED Marc Descamps' laptop is totally fried. Like Raphaël Dickens'. Raphaël Dickens, a forger with links to organized crime. And now Marc Descamps: family man... no criminal record. Descamps was in charge of reporting bank fraud. Maybe the killer was guilty of that? Torturing them takes time. He chooses them. And the eyes must mean something. Online scams can come from mafias like the one Dickens worked for. Maybe Descamps was onto them? That's a clue. We can look into that. Why didn't Descamps spend the weekend with his family? He had to work. And I wonder how the killer knew that. CONTRACT? He was a discreet man. Serious, a hard worker. Did Descamps receive any threats? No. He was just a cog in the wheel. He wasn't at the top or bottom of the chain. His wife said that he was working on an urgent file. - Do you know which one? - No... Marc didn't really work on urgent files. We're looking into this man. Raphaël Dickens. Marc never spoke about his private life. I'll need all the files Marc was working on. Yes, of course. INCOMING CALL DIANE WOUTERS Thank you. My client's timetable. You can see that Sandrine was at school. We tend to summon the folks we want for questioning. Sandrine is 14. She experienced trauma. I won't have her relive the horror. This is her school timetable. I added her teachers' numbers. I read the file. Dickens claims she made it all up. That would be so much easier for everyone. Sorry, it's... It's my brother. He signed me up to a dating site and I don't know how to get rid of it. Divorced? Widowed. Sorry. Thanks for your help. I have your number just in case. - Any news on Marc Descamps? - No trouble, no mistresses. He was one boring dude. What about you, how's it going on Clicker? Interested in anyone? - We've got a serial killer on our hands! - Go on, not even one? No, not one, several. All of them actually! Cool... And the lawyer? Diane Wouters? - Yeah. - She's not bad. I like her! Looks like Chantilly 38 isn't as boring as her husband. You hacked into my Clicker? Guys, it's Marc Descamps' wife. Pull up her history. - She's active! - Yeah, but not for the last four months. Maybe she found the one. Check her bank transactions: debit cards, credit cards... Let's see what other surprises Mrs. Descamps is hiding. Hotels, restaurants, city breaks, museums... With your husband's boss. Why did you cut your weekend short? To tell him that I wanted a divorce. Things went sour. Is that why your husband ended up toast? No. So, Karel Vertongen, your lover, took care of it? No! It's not... I knew she would tell him everything. And you? Is that what you wanted? Maybe everything was going too fast. And you panicked. It didn't bother me, quite the contrary. I love her. Marc wouldn't divorce, is that it? And you killed him to speed up the process. No, I was with friends! We didn't kill him, there was no need. My husband had become a ghost... totally addicted to work. Or something else. Something else? All I know is that he said he was going to Asia to develop a branch. It wasn't true. We don't even have offices in Asia. We knew he was lying, but kept quiet. That obviously suited you. What was he doing there? No idea. Did you tell his wife? Maybe she got revenge? No. Never... Why didn't you tell us? I didn't want to taint the image of their father. Their marriage had been over for a while. But he was the father of her kids. In a way, I was relieved. OK, thanks. Karel Vertongen's friends confirmed his alibi. And her? I don't see her doing that alone. Why? Because she's a woman? Fake passports, fake trips, two men tortured to death... What are we missing? There's no Asian visa in Marc Descamps' name. What if Dickens had sold Descamps a fake passport? Maybe he asked for his visa under a fake ID? Descamps has a clean record. Why would he need a fake passport? Asia, maybe it's linked to drugs. Burned eyes, computers wiped clean... Attempted rape on a minor. Sex tourism. Our two victims are pedophiles? We have to go search their homes. Damn... Found in Marc Descamps' garage, under the name Thierry Tarque. Full of stamps for Thailand and the Philippines. We missed it the first time. This was also at Raphaël Dickens' place, stuck to the fridge. I found a bank account in Thierry Tarque's name. All of his outgoings in Asia. Fun Toys. Fun Toys... Fun Toys. Dickens also bought from Fun Toys. Come with me. What exactly do you do? Defend children in any way possible. This is Florence Bogaert, in charge of tracing sexual predators online. - Do you infiltrate the networks? - There's no need. We receive images directly to our site. Who sends them? People who randomly come across them. We verify them and if the images are pedo-pornographic, we assign them a unique digital fingerprint. - And pass them on to the police. - So, you just observe them! We can't provoke them. That's incitement, it's illegal. You just stick to protocol? Laws don't always protect the right people. Have you heard of Fun Toys? It's the eBay for pedophiles on the darknet. They play out their clients' fantasies in photos and videos. The images, the victims, it was awful. How do you do it? It's the price to pay for saving kids. OK, we're leaving. Goodbye. Thanks, goodbye. What's going on between you two? - Nothing. - Yeah, right. Not sleeping? Be careful on the Internet. Don't talk to strangers. Dad, you've told me this a thousand times. I'm not a baby any more! You'll always be my baby. Emmy? OK. Do you think I'm a bad father? I don't know, I don't have any others. If one day... If I saw... If you slept with someone other than mom? Emmy... It wouldn't bother me. Now, hold on... I'm not saying that I'm seeing someone. Dad... It won't make you a worse dad, OK? OK. You have ten minutes. Come. Are you OK? Raphaël Dickens and Marc Descamps... are despicable people. - Billie. - Shit. Sam! Are you OK? No, I'm not. What we saw was horrifying. The boys... A girl who was barely ten... Stop... Stop. I shouldn't have left you alone. It's not your fault. It's not your fault, Sam. Descamps and Dickens had many of the same images. So? They knew each other. Since Descamps had a fake passport from Dickens... maybe they shared images. Through a private forum or network? You've seen enough. Take the day off. Maybe it's the parents of a victim. Or a former victim who's grown up. Using vengeance as a release. That's it! I have a private forum. I'll send it to you, Billie. How did you do it? Comparing the time online with files sizes both men sent and received... We'll get to that later. Are you in? No. It's protected. - Let's create a fake profile. - That's illegal. Go on. A third man shared a lot of files with Descamps. Thomas Anders. I'll pull up the IP address. Just get the address from the provider. It's been ransacked. Try to go in, I'll go around. Police! Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Oh, God. You can help me out... Is that OK? Not the arm! Oh, fuck. That's fine, thanks. You should hit the gym again. I'll get by, thanks for your concern. And how's he doing? He got quite a few shocks. It's nothing compared to your scratches. He'll be fine. It'll be a while before he can answer our questions. Good news is that the killer had no time to delete the content. We can find out what he was hiding from us. Thanks, that's a lot better. - Sam, you shouldn't be here! - It's fine. What? I'm cycling, it's less dangerous than a car. - There's a malware in one of the files. - What kind? A basic, but efficient one. It copies all personal info when the file is opened. It's the video of the girl. That's why he burns their eyes. To punish them for watching it. The killer is linked to this video. We never see the rapist's face. Could we identify the girl? It won't be easy. The video's at least 20 years old. Nassim, can we use your ageing software? Diane Wouters. That video has haunted me ever since I saw it. But she lived through it. If it were me in the video, I... Nassim, Bob, go to her place. Billie, let's go to her work. - Where's Diane Wouters? - I haven't seen her since yesterday. She tortured two men, injured two others. So...? I have no idea. She's not opened up to me in a long time. - Since when? - Since Sandrine's trial. Sandrine Forget? The girl who took Dickens to court. Diane asked me to go through Raphaël's computer. And you did? Of course. Then what happened? Afterwards, she shut herself away and lost the trial. She saw the video, her video. - So, why let Dickens out into the wild? - To see who sent it to him. She kills anyone who watches the video. - Is that her desk? - Yes. I'll take her laptop. Diane Wouters wasn't at work. She wasn't at home either. She's a recluse. There are at least four bolts on her door. Come. The system recognized her prints. Wouters is her mother's maiden name. Her name's Claes, like her father. Diane Claes, raped by her piano teacher, aged nine. Fuck... Nine years old. The guy killed himself before the trial. Now let's analyze the video from its content. Yes? It has the same malware. Wouters downloaded the video and installed a tracker. Allowing her to get any info on those who have the video. Another guy watched the video. Got an address? Hold on. Do you recognize me? No? Don't you recognize me? No? Hurry. What do you want? Don't you recognize me? No? I was 12 in the video, you watched it! - Got it. - Let's go. Please. I never touched a child! How do you think those videos you buy are made? How? Know what it's like to be raped for years and for no one to do a thing? Diane! Drop the Taser. That man will go to prison. Yeah, when he gets out, he'll do it again. Diane! Don't make me do it. What are you gonna do, kill me? I already died 20 years ago. Listen... Diane, please, put that down. Why didn't you come to us? No one can help me. Every time someone looks at that video, it's as if... Over and over again. Meanwhile, those jerks at Fun Toys will get away with it. No, don't worry. Do you really wanna know? No. I had a look at this. The good news is that jerk will go to jail. The bad news? I'll never sleep the same again. TH3MIS: I NEED A FAVOR TH3MIS: I NEED A FAVOR GOLDKEY: WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS? TH3MIS: TOTAL DESTRUCTION See you tomorrow. It's... It's not a diamond...
