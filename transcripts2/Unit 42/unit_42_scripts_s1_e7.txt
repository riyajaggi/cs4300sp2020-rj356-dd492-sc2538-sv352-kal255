 In half a mile, turn right and then turn left. CONNECTED Game's over. One last one! That was the last one. Give. - Did you fix it? - It should be fine now. I'm going to install this. What is that? Spyware? It'll speed it up. That's Camille. Want to play with me?

 What are we building? The Eiffel Tower? - A UFO? - No. A house? Yes! A nice, cozy house that smells of freshly baked bread. Like here. Yeah, like here. I gotta go. What have we got? We were notified about the car at around 7 a.m. With a dead battery and this young woman inside. A Caucasian in her thirties. No phone, no ID.

 She was already dead - before she ended up here. - Time of death? 10 p.m. How did she die? Palpating her intestines might indicate an overdose. But it's like a book: to know the story, you have to open it. The car ended up here. - No driver inside. - It's a semi-autonomous model. You can program it or drive it remotely with a computer program. Good. So find out who was holding the joystick. EFFICIENCY BATTERY Bam! I was able to hack into it. You wouldn't get it if I explained how. Don't think I can tell you who did it. But I can tell you that the car left from here, in the middle of nowhere, and was programed to crash over here. Into the quarry? She would've dropped 800 feet. The perfect crime. If he'd thought of recharging it. Good. This woman is a real mystery. Like all women. You'll approach the body now? You know she won't bite? Fabienne Magnot, single, no children, researcher at NanoTec laboratory. Her sister reported her missing. Bowel obstruction, a strong concentration of morphine in her tissue. An overdose. She must've shot up often. Look. Yeah... Her last injection was fatal. Clearly. And this scar? Tortured? No, a clean incision. Medical grade. The person who did that knows anatomy. They're all over. Can you date them? The oldest ones are about two years old. Some are two days old. - And the most recent are post-mortem. - Post-mortem? A drug mule? No, the scars are along her limbs and the spinal column. Organ trafficking? No, all her original organs are there. Right. But there are lesions she doesn't understand. OK. Thank you. Call me? No, she won't call you. Yes, she'll call you. The car belongs to the NanoTec laboratory in Diegem. An arson attack took place there a month ago. A parcel bomb that was sent by mail. It contained a detonator linked to a GSM with a prepaid card. - A suspect? - PLM. Pro-Life Movement. Ecoterrorists. The case was dismissed. No evidence, fingerprints or DNA. We found the person who bought the prepaid card via GPS. The guy in the hat? - Impossible to identify him. - I know. More about the fire? It happened in the middle of the night. There was one person working late. - Fabienne Magnot? - Precisely. She wasn't hurt. She called 911 in time. The fire didn't make it past the offices. But the fire targeted Fabienne Magnot. You talk to the sister. It's not my thing. You'll have to get used to it. Sandra Magnot? Yes. Hello. - Hello. - Right this way. Sometimes she didn't come home for a few days. She worked a lot. Why did you report her missing? It seemed different this time. We were very close. What happened? Some idiot did it last week. He came up from behind. He said, "From your lab rats." "From your lab rats." He thought I was my sister. Could you describe him? I didn't see him. It was dark. Did your sister have conflicts with anyone? No, she wasn't seeing anyone. And at work? I don't think so. She didn't talk about her work. I'd like to collect my sister's body. I understand. It's important to me. You can once the coroner has finished her work. We need to inspect your sister's computers. There's nothing left. We were robbed and they took everything. The phones too. You want a snack cake? Here. A complaint was filed for the robbery at the sisters' place. I'm checking out the PLM website. The most recent posts confirm they were keeping an eye on the lab. Let me see. They protest against the lab's animal experiments. And rightly so. - They targeted Fabienne Magnot. - A video. LOOK AT ME! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! I'm saving human beings! STRANGE SCARS ON BACK AND ARMS PLM = PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT ECOTERRORISTS I've got a screenshot of Fabienne's twin sister's attack. That's the same hat as the guy in the store. So our suspect is this faceless man. And he's nameless. The PLM is a leaderless group. And they don't use names. Great. We have two parts of a whole. Could we get a face if we put them together, Billie? Sometimes you surprise me, Sam. The algorithm calculates what's missing when it finds matching pixels. - What it finds on his left side... - Yeah. We got it. Thanks, Nassim. RECONSTRUCTING Here he is. We just have to figure out his name. Fabienne was brilliant. She was in charge of the entire department. What was her research on? Magnetic nanoparticles to improve gene therapy. To allow us to consider new solutions for treating cancer. When was the last time you saw her? Last week. You weren't worried when she didn't show? No, she was working more frequently at home, especially after the fire. She had also taken home a lot of her equipment. Fabienne was passionate. She was making headway in her research. Are you one of the PLM's main targets? When we harm the living... Do you know this man? That's Henry Ravet. He's a veterinarian who worked with us up until last year. Why did he leave? I fired him. Let's just say he didn't get along with Fabienne. All of our research is perfectly legal. We work with the university of science. The majority of our grants are funded by the government. So we must follow procedure. Did Fabienne Magnot use morphine in her research? I don't really know. Maybe her assistant Maureen knows. She must be next door. Thank you. I didn't know. When did this happen? Two days ago. Did you notice anything unusual these last few weeks? Nothing. Were you her only assistant? The only one who stuck it out. Why? No one could stand her. It was always tense with her. She didn't respect anyone. But you stayed. It was hard working with Fabienne, but it's good for your CV. Did you use morphine in your work? Not that I know of. Hey, guys. I'm Billie. You'll be... What's this? I saved them from slaughter. What should we call them? What do these things eat? Don't even think about it! Henry Ravet had a suspended sentence for vandalism. He'd freed 6,000 chickens from battery cages. Nice! But he's dropped off the radar since the fire. We need to find where the PLM meets. They organize via Twitter. With a hidden hashtag. PLM We just need to find the hashtag. Hashtag AZERTY? #BrigitteBardot? #MiceAreFriends? Of course! The ear tag has letters and numbers. A code? Look. PLM SAYS No way. Steganography? Not a bad idea! What? Info hidden in a bit. The hashtag must also act as a decoding key. - A hidden message in this post. - Saying? Looks like a time and meeting place. It's for tonight. Well, then. Next step, tomorrow night. Fanny, you'll be in the parking lot. Monitor the comings and goings and call us if you see anything weird. Manu, you'll come with me. We'll go in through the back, OK? Prep the cans of gas. Bring it all outside. Don't make a sound. - Police! - Police! Police! Hands up! Put your hands up. Let's go! Hands up! Now! Move, move! Against the wall. Go, go! You hear me? Sam! You, move it. Sam! Henry Ravet, hands up. Get a move on. Go. Forward. Target captured! Sit down. Hands in the air! I can't stand to see caged animals. Are you a veterinarian? I don't practice anymore. But you're no stranger to anatomy. And? Is that a crime? No, but murder is. We're investigating Fabienne Magnot's murder. You wanted to get even, no? Move it! I'm glad she's gone. Justice is made. A confession? I don't think you've read our chart. Our movement doesn't kill animals or human beings. And the fire? The parcel bomb sent to the lab wasn't meant to kill her? Just to scare her. What were you doing Tuesday night? I was... I was at a friend's farm for a calving. I don't practice, but I help out. I'm arresting you for your involvement in the fire at the lab. A press release? OK, on our way. We checked out Henry Ravet's alibi. A calf was born that night. The neighbors saw him leave at daybreak. As for the burglary, witnesses said a car was often parked at Fabienne's. I got the license plate number from a parking ticket. It's a car from NanoTec... but it's impossible to know who drove it. Where are they? Under a microscope. You're kidding? You're kidding? Were they dissected? - They're evidence. - Living things! A woman is dead. We must carry on. Damn it, Sam! There are other ways. When my wife got sick, I would've gladly dissected thousands to... They posted the research results on the website. Fabienne's results! Who? LabEx, our big competitor. They were doing similar research, but that was clearly copied and pasted. Finding anything? No, there's no virus. But you're not protected either. STOP BY WHEN YOU CAN. NEW DEVELOPMENTS. ALICE Maureen Sommers' search history was erased. It's weird. Maureen Sommers and Fabienne Magnot didn't get along? It's a long story. They fought over the invention of an idea. She didn't tell me. Maureen spread a rumor that using peptide-modified PEGylated quantum dots was her idea. Was it true? She was never able to prove it, but there was tension between them. I'd like to talk to Maureen Sommers again. Their research is stored here, protected by a password, as per usual. This is a list of everyone who viewed the research documents. The dates and names. Obviously Fabienne Magnot logged on, but so did Maureen Sommers. - She was her assistant. - Yeah. But if you look closer, Maureen Sommers looked at 120 documents at once. So either she's a speed reader, or she was copying everything. Maureen Sommers spies on Fabienne Magnot, she finds out and Maureen kills Fabienne so she doesn't tell. No one has seen her today. Sam, look. A plane ticket for Rio bought last night. It leaves in two hours. I'll send a team to the airport. The rats have the same lesions as the victim? Due to the excision of part of the nerves? Cell degeneration. A disease? That's all. Thank you. I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN DINNER YOU STILL OWE ME DINNER It was a close one. The little birdy tried to fly the coop. Hello. We found several vials like this one at Fabienne Magnot's. With your prints on them. She died of an overdose. Can you explain? I got them from the lab. Fabienne asked me for them. What for? One night she called me and asked me to bring them over. It was urgent. Why? She didn't say. And I didn't ask why. Did she ask you to send her research to your competitors too? LabEx contacted me. I didn't hesitate for long. What goes around comes around. Because she had stolen from you too? She wouldn't give me credit for my idea. So Fabienne Magnot realizes you sold her research to your competitors. And you kill her. No. I didn't kill her. I didn't do it. I... I stole her computers and hard drives. With all her research data? Yes. I killed her professionally, not physically. What were you doing Tuesday night? I was sending the photos to LabEx. You can check. It shows the date and time I sent them. - Wow, what a strong alibi. - And punishable by imprisonment. I didn't need to kill her to ruin her. I just needed to reveal her study protocol, and she'd have gone to prison. Are you ready? Rats weren't enough for her. And the photos from Fabienne's autopsy? The scars match, here and there. She was her own lab rat. OK, thanks. That works. The director didn't know, but he's not surprised. He thought Fabienne Magnot was ahead of her time. Transplanting those nano-things on herself... She got the equipment from work? Yeah, it was for the rats. My darlings! Just a blood test and a scan. One of the rats had this put in along its spine. Part of his nerve was removed and replaced by this microcomputer. It could correct cell degeneration in humans. Fabienne was sick. A neurodegenerative disorder. It was too dangerous to test that on humans. She tried it on herself to prove the opposite. But not alone. She must've had help. Huntington's disease. It attacks your nervous system. It's hereditary and there's no cure. Our mother died from it when we were 16. After which your sister began researching it. She operated on herself to find a cure. She tried to get permission for a clinical trial. - But she didn't get it. - No. It's a rare disease that affects less than 1,000 people in Europe. Fabienne died trying to save us. Do you have an idea of who could've helped her? No, I'm sorry. An officer will contact you about your sister's body. Thank you. Goodbye. Sam. In the photos' Exif data, I extracted a latitude, longitude and an altitude. It's the GPS address of a building that Fabienne Magnot's lab owns. I'll take floors 1-5, you got the rest? You forgot the altitude. Apparently, it's on the last floor. I'm also a hacker. MEDULLARY CORD A secret lab? More like an operating room. Who are you? I don't know you. It's a virtual personal assistant. Bravo. And who are you? I'm Detective Vebber. You can call me Billie if you want. And you? Cortana. What, do you think she'll tell you who killed Magnot? You just need to ask. Maybe that thing killed her. You'll see, in a few years we'll be replaced by this. Especially you. These cyborgs that will run and never get tired and can see in the dark. Super cops? Yeah, it's insane. What is that? Nerves modified in metallic alloy. When the spinal cord is weak, we can line it with artificial connectors. Like the one Magnot had. - Let's take that to the lab. - No need. They belong to Fabienne Magnot. Who carried out the operation? I am not authorized to tell you that information. Of course. You're going to talk! I am not programed to obey you. Who do you obey? I detect a bit of stress in your voice. Go ahead and torture her. Get her to talk. Shit. What are you doing? Shit! DELETING She's going into safe mode. DELETING FILES Wiping her memory! Shut it off! A suspect killing herself. That stands out, doesn't it? Stop hiding that you're implicated. I didn't know this place existed. Everything we've found has led us back to you. The equipment, the car. And now a secret lab in a building you own and have access to. It's an investment. I've never set foot there. Fabienne wanted a clinical trial, but her request was denied by the bioethics board. Was this refusal going to damage your lab's reputation? Some accused you of being a lunatic. Obviously. Yes, it was stupid. I had told Fabienne it was sheer madness. But she was so stubborn. Look where it led us. Maureen Sommers said she caught you and Fabienne arguing. You threatened to cut funding? Maybe. She used the lab's money for her research. You were afraid people would find out, so you killed her. I won't say another word. We got our guy. I'm not so sure. Not enough medical knowledge to operate on Fabienne. Whereas Corentin Bonami does. - Who? - Corentin Bonami. We saw his name in the clinical trial request. He studied medicine, then became a researcher, then a college professor. His research is on using nanotechnology in surgery. His university works with Fabienne Magnot's labs. Take a look. We saw him at the lab? Yes? What's this about? Fabienne Magnot. You knew her well? A gray Tesla on the run in the UCB parking lot. November, Lima, Lima, 874. Semi-autonomous model. Same as Fabienne Magnot's. Shit. Shit! Trapped like a rat. She consented. She wanted me to operate on her. Was it risky? I had warned her, but she was obsessed. You didn't have to operate. That's true. So why did you? I'm a scientist. My curiosity urged me to keep going. Even if it killed her? Fabienne's disease had gotten worse. So you decided to take things up a notch. She insisted. I couldn't say no. We were friends. She was doing well. I don't know what happened. A morphine overdose seems pretty simple. What did you say? Your injections killed Fabienne Magnot. She died of an overdose. I didn't do it. I didn't give her any shots. Is that so? When I arrived, Fabienne was lying dead on the operating table. - You didn't verify cause of death? - No, I panicked when I saw her. If someone discovered the lab and saw her there... I would've been complicit. - That you are. - I didn't kill her. You faked an accident to cover it up and destroy evidence. Shit, shit, shit! I didn't kill her. What the fuck... Damn it! She was a friend. Why do that? He was at a restaurant with his wife before going to the lab. A waiter confirmed it. He's still busted. Human experimentation and hiding a body. No kidding. So was it suicide? We only found Fabienne Magnot's DNA in the labs, on the needles and everywhere else. Case closed. You'll have to give them back. No way, I'm keeping them. They just need names. Sam and Billie? Igor and Grichka? - No way, the Bogdanoffs? - What? They're scientists and brothers. Twins. Oh shit. Now she can rest in peace. We came to return her phone. Thanks. We found it in a building. A secret lab. She didn't tell me about her work. I'm going to go. Goodbye. Fabienne? Seeing someone you love consumed by a disease. The pain she's enduring. Her body transforming as it's eaten away by that shit. I know that. In the middle of the night, you wonder what you can do. Nothing. Not a fucking thing. You can only watch her die. You can't do a thing. She was fed up, is that it? She wasn't getting better? She begged me to help her. The morphine didn't cut it? Are you sure? I couldn't stand seeing her like that. I let her go. It's what she wanted. Can I say one last goodbye? Please. OK, I'll wait here. Cancer didn't kill Camille. I did. She was sick. She was terminal. I knew one day... she would go. Nothing else to do. She said she couldn't take it anymore. She was so weak. We had more to do. She wanted to travel with the kids. Maybe have more kids. She could've lived a bit longer. Maybe a while longer. Or gotten better. I shouldn't have. I told her I didn't want to. She said it was an act of love. Thank you. I think about her every fucking day. I miss her. I'm mad at myself. And I'm mad at her for making me do it. Thank you. The lab results. It was indeed Fabienne's DNA, not Sandra's. I mean Sandra's DNA, not Fabienne's. We trust you, Bob. How could we have made that mistake? Twins have almost identical DNA. There's a slight difference that can be detected now. Yeah, long live science. Find any names yet? I haven't, but your kids have tons of ideas. They're for them. They love them. I sent Emmy a photo. She's so excited. Chill out, I'm kidding! We're keeping them. Our new mascots. Yeah. Alright. SEARCHED ALL OVER THE WEB. FOUND NOTHING ON ALEX YBERT. MY ADVICE: THROW IN THE TOWEL. Subtitle translation by Louise Layman
