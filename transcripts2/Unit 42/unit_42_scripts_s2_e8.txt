 ... Scared screams in the movie ... Epic classical music ... Scared screams in the movie Generic ... Soft music Honk Soft music -You're supposed to be at rest. -I called Jeff. For him to recover Nassim's business. -Go home. -Helene? Do you have something for us? -No. -Helene? -It was less than an hour ago. At Noda, a cinema in the center. Cock-and-bull story. -Do you feel ready? -Sat? There is nothing left on Nassim's desk. -I did a little tidying up. -Butin, you fired everything, what! Don't touch anything, OK? -Billie? -What? -Go home. -No ! I have to work. At home, I mill. -Where are we going? -At Noda. -I'm going with them. Sigh -According to the cashier, he's a regular. He comes every Tuesday. -Witnesses? -Around twenty. No one was seated next to him. And no doubt about the weapon of crime. -Death around 11:30 am. -By suffocation. -No impressions on the prosthesis, apart from his own. Thank you. -Guillermo Picavat. Researcher and prosthetist at the Cyborg foundation. No record, single. -Cyborg thing, it is those who traffic human bodies? -No 1 in Europe in cybernetics, yes. -We start on the thesis a prosthesis accident? Intriguing music Billie? ... -Guillermo was born with a malformation. As before there was only plastic arms, he designed his prosthesis himself. Connected. SMS ringtone There are articles about him on the Net. -And the Cyborg foundation? -They are 3. Guillermo took care of the prostheses. Charlotte Vekmans develops sensors who harvest skin data. And Dave Borrosian, he's the boss. Whoever finds the dough. -Fascinating, isn't it? Beep -What's this? -Murder with premeditation. The system has been hacked. They don't do it to me. Huh. The hacke code the signal emitted and we can control the prosthesis. -The range of the signal? -A few meters. It's bluetooth. -So he was in the room. Bob, go back to the movies, records bank transactions and video surveillance. -Already done. They don't do it to me neither to me. -So? -We only pay by cash. We can't trace anything. -And the cameras? -Factices. Except that of the bar which films only on a restricted angle. I didn't find anything foolish. -Concentrate on every Tuesday of the month. Beep Laughs -I can tell you nothing. Only Guillermo could program the processor. -Who could have done that? -He had enemies? -Not Guillermo, no. -He operated here, in the foundation? -We have an operating room. -Under what status? -Research Center and prosthetic surgery. I had the authorization, 4 years ago. -Trouble during an operation? -No. Read the testimonials on the site, on the blog:all grateful. -Guillermo was very good. -Yes. It was known. Our agenda is full over 2 years. -You hear yourself with competing labs? -There is no rivalry in cybernetics. We all help each other. -We help each other. -Wow! -All. -Thank you. I need the list of people that you have operated on. -I'm sending this to you. -What's this? -Nano-robots. They detect my sick cells. I have myopathy. My brother is dead of this disease at 9 years old. It could have saved him. -Thanks to that, we detect the points cell anchoring. -Thank you. ... Soft music ... -I do not understand how he could throw himself in the mouth of the wolf. -We should have intervened earlier. -You knew he was going to ask his mutation? -Yes. Hélène told me. -I called patients on the list. -And? -All delighted with their work. And rather up against classical surgery. -It's tempting to increase its capabilities. -I have acomplaint filed against the foundation, 2 months ago, by a certain Pierrick Sulzac. He took it off a week after. -Do we have something on him? -It's an independent developer. It designates interfaces for a lot of things. -Perfect profile for hacking. -He filed a complaint for what? -Flight of a neural interface that the foundation would have used for a prosthesis. -It's the same interface than Guillermo's arm? -Yeah. -And his phone was limited to Noda 15 minutes before the murder. -Turn off the camera. -It's impossible. But it doesn't register. -You can remove it? -No. -What were your reports with Guillermo Picavat? -No. -We will help you. He stole from you. -And you filed a complaint against him. -Not against him. Against the foundation. Dave, the big man, he's a bastard. -Why? -He's thinking about the money. He doesn't give a damn about anything. -Guillermo used your interface to create a prosthesis. -I gave him. -Hence the withdrawal of complaint. -We have found an arrangement. -What were you doing at Noda, this morning? -I was going to see a movie. -Your phone left it there the 2 previous Tuesdays. Was it for a movie? -Stop your canards. We have identified you on video surveillance, at the cinema bar. You were talking to him. It sounded serious. -What were you talking about? -I do not know anymore. From Kubrick, I guess, or Polanski. Why? You like the movies? -At 11:30 am, you were at the Noda. -Guillermo went to see his film. Me, I spun to a medical appointment. An implant in the jaw. The cinema is right next door. I can send you GPS coordinates. -No it's OK. Just the name of the doctor. It will be fine. ... Intriguing music ... -Come on ... Intriguing music ... The door opens. What is it? -There is no sound on the videos. The program is lip-smacking and decipher. -I submitted the file. They will follow us. -Perfect. -It was two weeks ago. -That's all? -Yes. It was Nass, the pro of this software. -The dentist confirmed: Pierrick was under the strawberry at 11:30 am, at the time of hacking. Beep -I order a pizza? In 48% of cyber attacks, it is a financial motive. To laugh -It works, this thing. -It's a website which compiles the digital data of a deceased person ... and which regenerates his personality. It's crazy. -Trop well, this algorithm! -Billie. Stop that. -No. He left too quickly. -Erase it. Must move on. -Ah yes... What did you do when your wife died? -It has nothing to do. -Of course yes ! -Erase that. -No. -Erase. -No ! Let go of me. -Billie. -I miss him ! Whore. Sad music ... SMS ringtone -We'll end up believing that you have a mistress. -It's an app that I downloaded, who sends me stuff. -Watch. "Life cannot be counted by breathing, but at times that take your breath away. " -Yes... It's stupid, but hey ... It brings me back to the point. -I have the impression that he's on vacation. That he will come back. -Hum ... Nassim gave me this one day. Against the evil eye. And that was my mother. -You think that by doing that, it will get better? -If that helps us ... -We weren't there for him. -We did what we could. -We weren't there. -Do not hang on to his remorse. It took me a long time to understand it. Don't do the same. -We are not the same. -You described it well. He came almost every night. We were chatting. He was taking a glass of water. Then a pineapple Malibu. I knew how he was to the amount of alcohol that he asked me to put on. Sometimes at the end of the evening when there was no one left, he was dancing. To Nassim. -A Nassim. -A Nassim. -A Nass. -Hum! Oh, damn, the acidity. -Oh ! Laughs -Excuse me. -Waouh! -I can? Nass, do you give us a sound? -With pleasure. Electro music ... Closing the door -Dave Borrossian is ill? -No why? -Ben ... I looked the demarcation of his telephone. He's at the hospital every 3 days. Hmmm! I can? -Yes. -Maybe a parent is hospitalized there. -No, I checked. -He's not sick. He's recruiting. -Yes. He must seek patients. -It's bad for you, kitten. Soft music ... Hi, Nass. -Hello, Billie. -The last 2 glasses, I should not have. -You drink too much, Billie. Do you want an aspirin? Little laugh -Thank you, buddy. Soft music ... SMS ringtone -"Inhale Exhale. Remember the privilege of living. " Strong inhale and exhale -You are on the K4OS answering machine ... " -15 X that I call, he does not reply ! -I can answer anything. What do you want? -OKAY. Cheers. I'm going back to work. Vibrator ... Soft music ... -Hum ... -Uh ... These 2 people had surgery to the foundation, but are not in the list that Dave gave you. -Why? -So that we don't know that it messed up? I found out when I called the hospital where Dave recruits. They had to be asked a prosthesis there, but have changed their minds. -Dave had offered to operate on them? -I think. Except that a few months later, they came back get treatment at the hospital. -Why? -Degradation of the nervous system. -How is it related to the prosthesis? -Their doctor says that the prosthesis was incorrectly fitted. I have the medical records. -Fortunately, "all" their operations were successful. -Him, he is in a closed center for 8 months. And her is Angèle Debor. She has a small locker: blows and injuries, to the output of a nightclub. -If Guillermo had screwed up, I would be Angèle, I would be pissed off. Electrocardiogram beeps ... -It's for her to have more autonomy. Her vagus nerve was affected. -How did she lose her arm? -Accident. Angèle liked to party. One evening, she hit a tree. She had drunk too much. -Is it hard to see her like that? -We celebrated his 30th birthday yesterday. We do not imagine to be like that at this age. -Why you contacted the foundation? -It was a great stupidity. Angèle was an instructor climbing and with one arm, she had to stay on the ground. So, the connected prosthesis, he liked it. -What were you doing yesterday, at 11:30 am? -I was here, like every day. -Someone can testify? -A nurse, why? -Guillermo Picavat was assassinated. Are you a computer scientist? -At Bel Tel. Finally, before. I resigned to take care of Angela. -I can have the name of the nurse. -When you have found the murderer, will you thank him for me? I often thought to kill that bastard. He ruined my life. But I don't even have anymore strength. You know what it is? To see his wife waste away like that. Thes super expensive care, insurance which supports nothing. Fortunately that my parents help me. We are at home here. Sometimes I'd rather she ... -Jérémy was at home the morning of the murder. The nurse confirmed. But he was able to pay someone. -No. -No, they are ruined. Buzzer -I submitted the file. They will follow us. Charlotte will follow us. Are you sure? She's going to have it bad. He had only to assume its responsibilities. This kid dies and we do nothing. I hadn't signed up for it. -Afterwards, they're in it. We won't know more. -The file they are talking about, that could be it. They had just dropped off a request for help from Isep, the creative organization scientific enterprise. They wanted to open a research lab. -It's the arrangement that Pierrick was talking about. -It's competition for Dave. He was going to lose money. -There is something weird. This association, does Pierrick ... Why didn't he mention it? -OK, I'll get it. -You take care of Dave and Charlotte? -What was the point of saying it? Guillermo is dead and our project too. -Pierrick. Talk to us. -Yes. To end up like Guillermo? No thanks. -There was a suitcase in your trunk. -And a ticket to Buenos Aires. In ... your digital data. -You wanted to leave? Who were you afraid of? -From whom? From Dave! Who else? -He knew about the project? -This guy is sick. I keep telling you. He had threatened Guillermo. -Why? -He didn't want to operate anymore. The prosthesis was not ready. Dave put the pressure on him. Then the funk. -The operation, was that Angela Debor's? -I believe. There was another. An Armenian who went crazy. Guillermo wanted to help them. He felt guilty. But Dave dissuaded him. As usual. With threats. You do not understand. Dave wants to save his money and his reputation. Cell phone ringtone -Yes, Bob? -Yes, Sam. I found Charlotte. -OKAY. Go home. Prohibition to leave the territory. -But... -Billie. -Can I stay here? -No fingerprint, no fiber and no break-in. -No break-in ... But a lot of traces of struggle. Dead from internal bleeding around 9 a.m. -She did it alone? -OUH THE ... This is what caused hemorrhage. -The remote control has been hacked. Nano-robots are programmed to have a precise cycle. But the, the cycle is reversed. -It destroyed cells and tissues. -This kind of hacking is impossible without an enclosure nearby. -I'm sticking to it. -Well... Where is this Dave? four hundred ninety seven 00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,319 -Bob. His telephone terminal to the foundation. Doorbell Hold on. There was an intrusion. Scary music Loading the weapon ... He would have fled without his phone? -No, he was kidnapped. -"Who's afraid of robots?" "The sorcerer's apprentices". "A cyborg killer". Dirty ad for cybernetics. Journalists go wild. We're looking for a crusade. -Guillermo and Charlotte are not the only ones targeted. -We can't locate Dave by one of its implants? -It's the only one which is not increased. Someone's knocking at the door. -You were right for the case at Charlotte. -That is to say? -Implanted nanorobots inside charlotte's body have been hacked via a transmitter box. -A so-called technician from Bel Tel put a box on the wall from the neighbor the day before yesterday. He came back this morning to take it away. -Bel Tel? Jérémy, Angela's boyfriend, was working there. -It takes another element to corner him. Do you have a composite? -Yes, but it's not ... I have pictures of the place where he put the case. And I found this. -Ok and I'm supposed to what to do with that? -You need some backup. Without Nassim ... -What? Are you going to replace it already? assim, what would you do in my place? Robotic voice -I can not give you an answer. What are you talking about? -And uh ... What do you think of this cable? -Currently researching. -And of this photo? -Currently researching. I'll contact you again with a suggestion. -Great. Telephone dial tone -Hello, you are well on the K4OS answering machine ... ... -Get out there. I will continue on foot, it's less risky. -OKAY. Turn signal -We will spare ourselves a ridiculous separation. -OKAY. I'll join you. -No. Sam, no. Forget me. You will find someone with whom it is possible. It will be fine, I promise you. -Your ticket. Passport. And money. Sad music ... -Thank you. Door slam Soft music Sigh Footsteps -Where were you? I am not the nanny orthe mother in this barracks. -Emmy ... -I keep my brothers 1 night out of 2. Either you tell him to come and live here, either you leave her. -I am sorry. I beg your pardon. Sobs -Dad, are you okay? What is happening? -What are you doing here? -And you? -We need to find Dave. I might have something for the housing. If we take the gap between the bindings, it can't be than a McJinsey or a Systamat. Bel Tel. -Check my buddy. -Billie ... You should stop this. If you want a few days, take them. -Do you want that I compare the enclosures? -You can compare these photos to me and those found on the Net? It is surely the same case which was used to hack the foundation lock and hacking at Charlotte's. And surely also for cinema. -Send me the photo. -Check, my friend. -I have seen this box before. -Yes. In Angela's room. Flashes. -Good game. Scary music ... Shock Screams of pain -Stop, please... Stop. -It's Jérémy Reiser, Angèle Debor's boyfriend, who got the box via his father. We have to find him. -Jeremy's father? -Yes. Jean-Yves Reiser. Security engineer and electricity. He disappeared from radar. Shock Screams of pain -He is neither at home, nor at work. And his cell phone is cut off. -So, what does it do to die slowly? Shock Screams of pain -What would you do with the man that you kidnapped and what you want kill discreetly? -I would take him to the forest and him would empty a magazine in my head. -Something else? -I would take him in a place that I know well. -Where I wouldn't be disturbed. -Tell. That those who come for treatment at home know what they risk. Shock -Stop. -Come on ... It's for your website. Screams of pain -He works for McJinsey since 25 years. -McJinsey owns an abandoned building in the center. -Let's go. Bob, send reinforcements. Shock -Stop Please. -No. Sobs I'm not going to stop. I will let you die as you did to Angèle. -I will help you. We're going to get her out of there. -How? 'Or' What? It's a plant! We can't do anything more! -I am sorry. -And myson, have you thought about it? To his life today? -I did not do anything. It was Guillermo who operated on them. -Guillermo, Charlotte, you, it's the same. You play mumuse with your crap cybernetics. Screams of pain Scary music ... -I agree with you. Cybernetics, it's dangerous. -Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up! You only see the money how it earns you! -I can give you some, money. Here ! -Jean Yves ! Stop that. Shock -Stay where you are or I'll kill him. -What you do will not help. Put that down. -You have to let me do it. He must die, like the others. -Jean-Yves, please. Deposit... Jean-Yves, please! Stopped ! Shock. Cries of pain. Stopped ! Shoot -Come on ! Go! ... Phone ring Just go. Read us the thought of the day. -It's Bijou. No, the app ... I took it off. Too stressful in the end. I prefer to live rather than remind me to live. -It seems to be going well for Angela to win her case against Dave. With his confession, she will surely be compensated. -And the foundation? -She will lose the right to perform medical acts. Report tomorrow? -Yes. -Compared to last year, 20% increase in cybercrimes in the country. -Oh it's... Sad music -Hi, buddy. -Hi friends. Laughs -I will never forget you. -Diane Wouters? Oh shit...
