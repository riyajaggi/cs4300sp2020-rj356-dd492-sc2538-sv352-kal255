 What is it? - Come here. - Let go of me! No! UPLOADING Will you bring your gun? My gun? Where? To my school. No ham for me, please. FAITH AND LAW For career day. Right, we'll see. I have a lot of work.

 But you promised. It's such a conservative job anyway. Please, Dad. Is that fun? My conservative job. Ismaïl Bouayad. Twenty-six years old. Throat slit open. The video was uploaded right after the murder. Disgusting. It already has hundreds of views. We need to take it down now. OK, but it must be circulating. - Any prints besides the victim's? - No.

 Find anything? The killer is 5'7" and is right-handed. A clean, precise cut. No hesitation. Exactly what we see in the video. Thank you. And hello. You question the neighbors? They're at work. I'll come back tonight. This computer was used to upload the video, but there's nothing else of interest. Why put that online? - To scare people. - Propaganda. It resembles the Salafist MO. No one's claimed ownership. Ismaïl Bouayad. Abu Ali Majed. Known by the GISS. ISIS? Had a record of cyber recruiting. This case should be dismissed. We're here to find an assassin, not to play judge. Maybe he recruited the suicide bombers in Zaventem. Or not. If it were true, you wouldn't care? Nassim, first we investigate, then we'll confirm it. There's only six lines in his bio. For a wanted criminal? A recruiter back from Syria who's not convicted or monitored. I left a message with Louis Vermeer who handles national security. We'll see. Couldn't we go see him? OK... Ismaïl Bouayad, back from Syria two months ago. He recruits people online to become jihadists. He's responsible for sending at least four kids, one of whom died in combat. Iliès Hammadi. - First suspects: the parents. - Yup. Would you slit the guy's throat who recruited your kids? If you want it all to stop. - You'd forgive your kids if they did... - Yes. ...a horrible thing? Even if they spoiled a TV show? Parents screw up too, you know. BEST VIDEO ON THE INTERNET A racist murder. Well, that's for sure. Based on the video comments, quite a few people would've slit that guy's throat. That's 30 times more suspects. Let's talk to Bouayad's parents first. ELEVATORS OUT OF SERVICE No more! Mr. Bouayad. Come in. This is my wife, Zoubida. - My condolences. - Thank you. Ismaïl was trouble. He wasn't always like that. He got a degree in psychology. He did very well in school. What changed? I don't know. We lost everything. No one talks to us. We had to move. We'd owned our grocery for 20 years. Ismaïl's left a hell of a mess. My daughter, Dounia. Thanks. Her friend, Cléa. She's lost her boyfriend. Because of Ismaïl. - What was her boyfriend's name? - Iliès. Iliès. - Iliès Hammadi? - Yes. He died in Syria. Driving kids to their deaths. Can you imagine? When did you last see Ismaïl? He came here a month ago. I kicked him out. He wasn't family anymore. I forbade him to talk to us, especially to my wife. He's my son, you know? She tried to reason with him. He's my son. I always loved him. How'd it go? We checked on everyone who commented on the video. No leads. There's no trace of Ismaïl Bouayad online since he returned from Syria. Nothing on social media? - Blogs, online games? - Nothing. That's impossible. He recruited 3 of the 4 kids online. We'll find something. He suspected he was being watched and was keeping a low profile. OK, thank you. The kids' parents are coming tomorrow morning. Right. Wait. I think we have a new suspect. There's a blog under his soldier name, Abu Ali Majed. - That's how he got in touch with the kids. - Look. If you click on "like", it takes you to a hidden link. ISIS is manipulative and is usurping the Koran. It's all a pipe dream that shouldn't exist. It's not Ismaïl Bouayad. Resist the lies. No, the guy's tearing ISIS apart. Maybe this guy kills recruiters like Bouayad. Ismaïl Bouayad's phone was restricted to the same zone. What's that there? Storage rentals. A customer may fit the description of Ismaïl Bouayad. Got your gun? Storage unit 81. - Which one? - Number 81. Here it is. Wait. - What? - It might be a trap. He was a recruiter, not a suicide bomber. Shit, this is where the video was shot. Bouayad had switched sides. So Ismaïl was some kind of convert? He leaves for the caliphate, sees it's not like what he was promised, the myth is shattered and he spills the truth about ISIS. He could've been killed as a traitor by the Islamic state. If they unmasked him. Well, we did. We're the best, but still. Ismaïl exchanged emails with five undecided hopefuls. Maybe they snitched on him. - Ask Nassim to check their IP addresses. - Yes, boss. VISITOR We found your card with Ismaïl Bouayad's things. He was in charge of his case. You knew he died? - He heard it on the radio. - I got that. His file's practically empty. Were you protecting him? I was surveying him, like all other radicalized Belgian citizens. He'd rejected ISIS. He must've been a key figure. Joining the caliphate, he could've given you names. We offered to collaborate, but he refused. He was more useful as a free man than in prison. Makes sense. Why had Ismaïl converted? I don't need to answer all your questions, miss. There's a dead man! Handle the investigation on Ismaïl's death and we'll handle the radicalized. With the same great results? Do you know how many radicalized individuals live here? How many come back from Syria? We can't closely survey everyone. Aren't the ones who come back the ones who blow themselves up? Some don't need to leave to do that, miss. I assure you. Supposedly the Health and Welfare Center's council. He didn't give us anything. Thanks for your collaboration. Wonderful! No solidarity. It's every man for himself. Going to the can. DOWNLOADING 5 ITEMS I don't understand, I told your colleagues everything. - What's going on? - Your son was not a terrorist. Ismaïl was not a terrorist. He was fighting against ISIS. He made videos to convince kids not to go. Are you sure? He had left the Islamic state. Thank you. I don't know how it happened. Iliès had a lot of friends. He even had a girlfriend. How can someone be that brainwashed? And so quickly? When my son died... It's dumb, but I thought if I'd ever meet the notorious Ismaïl, I'd do him in. I'm mostly mad at my kid. He was dumb enough to believe in that shit? We're not even Muslim. He was constantly getting arrested. But with Ismaïl, he took an interest in the Koran. He behaved better. He went to gatherings. When did you realize your son was in danger? Too late. So, how'd it go with the parents? It was hopeless. They have airtight alibis. One of the kids was recruited in a mosque. The parents think the imam knew. Maybe he got revenge since he was recruiting in his mosque. His repute at stake. With such a codified murder in front of a camera? Did you find anyone with Bouayad's IP addresses? We found three out of five. A teen from the south of France. He didn't move. Ismaïl had convinced him to stay put. There's also a journalist who's writing a story. He has an alibi. The third was a mother looking for help because her son wants to convert. Find out all you can about this imam. OK, but first... Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday... - It's not my birthday. - Yes, it is. - No, it's not my birthday, Bob. Bob says it is, so it is. He's insane! It's not... - He's insane! - Blow out the candles. Bravo! I sat across from a woman on the metro. She looked at me and then got off. Everywhere I go, I get looked up and down. I move my arm and people panic. People see me and think I'm a terrorist. The attacks impact everyone. Sam, I understand the Bouayads... The imam Abdel Mehenni is 50, has two kids and no record. Became a naturalized citizen 30 years ago and is mild-mannered. We'll check. His address? Sam, who's Ruben Adrienssen? Robin's teacher. Why? He called about career day. "He needs to be fun, approachable, and above all, should avoid sharing the gory details." That's me. You alright? Right. MOSQUE I banned Ismaïl from the mosque too late. He'd brainwashed the kid. Mohnder, the teenager. He was recruited here? I didn't see a thing. What were you doing on Thursday night? Do you think I killed Ismaïl? He was recruiting kids here, putting your reputation on the line. I was here at the mosque for the evening prayer. When was the last time you saw Ismaïl? Last week when he asked me for help. I told him he had some nerve to come see me. And I threw him out. He'd turned his back on ISIS. Two months ago. Hello, today's special. - Two, Nassim? - No. Sauce on the side. I traced the two missing IP addresses. - Of those in touch with Ismaïl? - Yes. One was at a public library. Today's special, no sauce. But the other one came from a grocery store right by the mosque. - Ismaïl's parents' store? - Exactly. Now it's run by Kharim Soleman and Jean-Louis Peeters. Ismaïl's best friends. Ismaïl converted Jean-Louis. - He now goes by Mohamed. - And? They're identified as "radicalized". So Kharim and Jean-Louis, aka Mohamed, find out their best friend is now against their cause. That's one hell of a motive. For your office door. Any info on them? - You have a concert tonight? - Yes. You're coming? We'll see. They went to the same mosque as Ismaïl Bouayad, but not since he was banned. Hey, guys! We questioned the neighbors. One woman saw two men enter the victim's home. Just before the murder. She described the guys and ta da! It's open? Anyone there? Police. Shit. Billie. The video's already online. Uploaded from this computer 50 minutes ago. Same killer? Not sure. Thousands watched Ismaïl's murder. It could be anyone. Will you keep an eye on my car? My baby's in there. What about your concert? Without the principal trumpet? Canceled. Sorry. Yeah. It's staged the same, but their throats were slit by a left-handed person. Two different killers? Possibly. Find any prints? No, but she thinks that they were drugged. She'll confirm that. Thank you. The victims knew their killer. They had tea together. What are you thinking? Could be two more converts and a jihadist settled the score. Or one of Ismaïl Bouayad's friends, avenging his death. Or a visionary who wants to wipe out a network of jihadists, without really knowing what it is. But they had tea first. I got blood on my shirt. Dad, did you want to be a cop when you were a kid? No. But I know a kid who does. It'll pass. I'd rather be a superhero. That's impossible. You can be a super cop, then. Not possible either. - What about you? - Model or personal shopper. Not bad. No. I want to be a lawyer. I'll defend all the people who are wrongfully arrested. That's good too. The dishes are done. Time for bed. - Can I have dessert? - No. - Why not? - Come on! We've got tons of cookies. I know, but I said no. Bedtime. You can take yourself to bed. Good night, Mom. Why didn't you give him a hug? They think it too. That I'm a bad dad. It's easy for you. You were selfish. The lab results. What? The lab results. There was benzodiazepine in the two victims' tea. That's over the counter. It doesn't narrow it down. But we know it was premeditated. And the two guys used the grocery as their HQ. We found emails and itineraries for sending their recruits to Syria. What did the things in Arabic talk about? About permission to leave the country. And it's confirmed that the two grocers knew Ismaïl made the videos. Kharim was in touch with Omar Alouidh, an ISIS leader. He was to find the person making the anti-ISIS videos. Mission accomplished. Kharim Soleman and Jean-Louis Peeters kill Ismaïl Bouayad. Then who killed them? Recruits? A test to prove their commitment? That matches the two killers' theory. But why turn against their recruiters? I found something sketchy. A blog to support Ismaïl Bouayad that was created by his parents. First, they disowned their son. Now, he's a hero. Anyone who supports it is a suspect. Who told them? Vermeer? He's the only one who knows. They had to know. Not during the investigation. If it were your son, you'd have wanted to know. We were going to tell them. But after. Nassim, do you know what you've done? I should arrest you. His parents were suffering. Damn it, Nassim! Everything OK? Take a few days off. They're tough at Molenbeek. Five damn forms to fill out to get this surveillance footage. What are you doing? Taking some time off. - What? - Taking time off. I'm too involved. Sam? He lets his emotions get the better of him. I know what it's like to be different. But you'll see, one day it'll be trendy. What is that? Surveillance footage in front of the grocery. It's likely the last person to go in is our murderer. Nassim, I found... Got a problem with Nassim? I don't have a problem with him, but he does with himself. Want me to talk to him? No. Adam Brouck has a record of forgery and use of forged items. He goes to this grocery about once a week. 6:17 p.m. Thirty minutes before the double homicide. Maybe he was bringing passports to Soleman and Peeters for their recruits. A settling of scores? We'd have two unrelated crimes? Adam Brouck. Bob, bring this guy in. And his computer. I get groceries there. Groceries... No halal store near you? I'm not Muslim. I'm not a criminal. I'm being careful so as not to return to jail. Your two friends are dead. I don't know anything. I can shop where I want. We found an encrypted file on your computer. What's in it? Your grocery list? Our best IT tech is on it. In five minutes... Amateur's code. I sold her short. Two blank passports for Laura Garcia and Inès de Smet. Who are they for? Laura Garcia and Inès de Smet. Their real names. This might refresh your memory. Or this? Come on. I'm telling you, I never know my clients' real names. He doesn't know them. So, there's a killer on the loose and two recruits who want to leave the country. With fake passports. I just went to the library. The fifth person talking to Ismaïl was his sister. Dounia and her friend Cléa. They're minors. They need fake passports to leave the country. They'd been talking for 2 weeks. The emails show she wanted to join the fight against ISIS. And she knew the grocery store. Maybe she went in the back entrance. That's why she wasn't on the surveillance tape. She saw her brother's murder - and wanted to copy it. - She slit their throats? Yeah. She drugged them first. Easier for a teenager. OK. Dounia discovers Soleman and Peeters killed her brother. She gets fake passports, she kills them, and continues the fight with her best friend, Cléa. Billie, let's go see the Bouayads. Bob, go to Cléa's place. Yeah. Is your daughter right or left-handed? - Left-handed. - Why? Any change in behavior since Ismaïl died? Not really. She's always been rebellious. Cléa isn't at home. No phone signal, so I can't locate them. That's mine. I have trouble sleeping. There's nothing. All I see are searches for the peshmerga. Yes, the Kurdish army. Testimonies of people who joined. They are at war with ISIS. Wait, there's a video. Mom and Dad, I'm sorry to leave like this, but I must join the fight. It's not your fault, but I can't stay here. Cléa and I will fight against ISIS. The airport. I'll miss you. We need to go. I love you. We need to stop. Shit, Cléa, they were terrorists! OK, then we need to tell someone. It was for a good cause. I can't stop thinking about it. Me neither, but we had to do it. I swear. Everyone complains but does nothing. We will do something. You think they know? Don't worry. Once we're gone, we're safe. Hello. There they are. Police! They're right there. Dounia! Cléa! - Cléa! - Dounia, stay there. Stay back. Don't move. Stay back or I'll jump. Leave me alone. Dounia, get down! Don't move, Dounia. - Dounia... - Dounia, no! Don't do it. - Dounia! - No! Let go of me, damn it! I said, let go! - Let go. - No. Help! Let go. I won't let go. - Dounia... - Let go of me. - Please, let go. - I won't let go! Hold still. - I won't let go. - Please. He's dead. I want to die too. Dounia. - Give me your hand. - Let go of me. Stay here, Cléa. - Hold still. - Let go! Hello? You can go see the Bouayads again. Take the car. I'll find a ride. You sure? But talking to kids about the future could be nice. You're here! And who's your lovely friend? Mr. Adrienssen. Hi, I'm Billie. The kids are overexcited. - Let's go. - Well, I don't... When I was your age, I wasn't sure I wanted to be a police officer. I dreamed of other jobs. But my studies led me to this job, and it's a great job. It's not really because I get to handle guns or run after robbers. This job is more about learning to talk to people, whether it's a suspect or a victim. You must be able to show great empathy. You need to understand them, and though you may see horrible things, being a police officer is like diving into the depths of human nature. Being a police officer is... - It's a job... - A conservative job? You're also a member of the cyber brigade? Yes, but I specialize in new technologies, video games, etc. For example, when a criminal uses video games to do something stupid... something foolish, my job is to... Our job. Yes, because it's a team effort. We have to trust one another. - Both of us. - Yes. - Yes? - My dad said video games make you crazy. Your dad is lying. That's my son. You lie to your son? When someone is bad, is he born that way or does he turn bad? BLDG A FLOOR 01 Subtitle translation by Louise Layman
