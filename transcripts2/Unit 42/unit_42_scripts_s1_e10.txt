 What the hell? Butt out! Stop, we didn't want that! Do you think your video will change the world? - Get out of my way! - No! The boss in action. Quick, precise, unbeatable. I hope you're not talking about him! - Yeah! - Yes! My turn. What's going on?

 Shit! - You OK, Bob? - Yeah. - Got a signal? - Not at all. - Nassim, did you find it? - It didn't originate here. An act of sabotage. A technician found this in the transformers. - An iron bar? - Yes. They also found tire tracks and footprints on the ground. They're dating them and making molds. What's that? Burnt blood. How did it get there? A staff member?

 All employees were at their posts when the outage happened. Security said no one came in, but we need to check the footage. Same thought? Besides a trained condor, only a drone could've dropped that in there. Bob and Nassim, follow the tire tracks to see where they go. My computer's about to die. It's inhuman to take the web hostage! Yeah. Today, even the truth depends upon electricity. I never thought you'd see this place. The building's in remediation. Unsanitary and inhabitable. A scheme? It cost me a night's work going through the land registry files. - With the help of your personal concierge? - Exactly. Here's the footage. You were right about the drone. And a big one at that. Adequately large to carry an iron bar heavy enough to cause an outage. It must be a non-commercial prototype. Maybe military grade. Or darknet. That would take months to find. What else? And the state of the network? Shit... What? It's super slow. This isn't a raid. Sam, look at this. Domino effect. A blown transformer whose surge blasted 10 to 15 other ones. And I thought the network protected us. There's your proof. Nassim for Sam. Yes, Nassim? We found a body. - He died... - He died about four hours ago. My French never progressed as much as when I went out with Annie. The cause of death? Brain hemorrhage. A hard blow. A heavy, blunt object. Like a metal bar? It's possible. She took some samples, and she will tell us once the machines turn back on. - Any ID? - No, nothing. Right... She's in withdrawal. Four hours without internet. A scar. A hip replacement? A prosthesis means a serial number, means identity. But no electricity means no X-rays. We need to identify him. It's urgent. You're kidding? It doesn't look like it. Thanks. What are you doing? Bring a light over here. Ready, Bob? Yeah. Not in my eyes, but there. OK, there. A-X-V... 17-640... W-D... 635... 89. Got it? Good. It's going to take a while to find his name. How'd they do it back in the day? Wrongful convictions. The victim's name is Marc Vanberg. A thermodynamic engineer who specialized in wind turbines. Thanks. It's hot. Obviously. An environmentalist. Like a saboteur? No, he'd have more likely tied himself to a tree. Tom, it's me. I'll be a little later than planned. - How are the kids? - All's well. Plus, the power outage made it easy to take away the video games. No worries, they're asleep. OK, thanks. So, this Marc Vanberg? A rebel, just like I like them. No! He invented the Wind Tree. WIND TREE AT A GLANCE A wind turbine, but prettier. A visionary as well. Wait. That's his drone. Look. Nuclear energy is particularly vulnerable for our country's security. When will we replace it? Once everything explodes? Blue Planet? Yeah, it's his blog. We need to ground the entire system to realize how fragile we are. A total blackout. I didn't see it coming. I didn't see my husband change. He was politically active, then became frustrated and in the end... Maybe he didn't love me anymore. I can't be surrounded by walls. You must think I'm crazy. No, not at all. I thought he was in Luxembourg at a symposium on renewable energy. Did he say anything before he left? Nothing. I knew it would happen. Marc did too. It was a risk. What do you mean? Marc was a passionate activist. His father worked at a power plant. Thank you. One day they fired him. He was denouncing security risks on nuclear sites. It left its mark on my husband. He picked up the torch in his own way. FTS. - Fuck the system. - That was his creed. Was he threatened? One day... he said that if something happened to him... Excuse me. It's OK. He was a good man. He just stood up for his ideas. He didn't use violence. He said, "Convince, not conquer." - Did your husband work alone? - No... He'd always worked with Lambert Hammers. Lambert Hammers. Where can we find him? I don't know. They met in an office they rented in town. One last question. Why was your husband at the plant last night? CREATED HIS BLOG, BLUE PLANET, IN JANUARY 2010 EVIDENCE Lambert Hammers. Trained biologist who quickly turned to politics as advisor to the Ministry of the Environment. He must've given Marc Vanberg info on the government's projects. Why hasn't he been brought in? We can't find him. On unpaid leave for four months, he's not at home, his phone is disconnected. We can't locate him. FTS. It has a nice ring to it. So... Marc Vanberg sabotages the power plant. Then he's killed. But who did it? Someone didn't want him to talk. The ministry or Électrabel? A conspiracy? It'd been a while. Bob! I don't think Marc Vanberg caused the blackout. - You alright? - Yeah, thanks. His wife said he was a pacifist. "Convince, not conquer." I got it. You OK? It's the stuff they found at Vanberg's. The government and pro-nuclear lobbies must be involved. Two against one. Find me proof and I'll join your cause. Here it is. Nothing? It is tempting to try to change the system. You're part of the system now. Yeah, I know. No! What? Vanberg was in contact with Free_Dom. And? FTS, slash Free_Dom, slash... Dominic Dalmot! This is epic! This is insane! Dominic Dalmot! He was my idol when I was a kid. Sorry, Billie, we're not as cultured as you. The libertarian activist, Dominic Dalmot. A superstar in the geek community, known for defending an Internet without any rules. He's 62 and he fights against the commercialization of code. He thinks the Internet should be free and available to everyone. OK. And FTS is his mantra. What's surprising is that he's been in prison for three years since he lost his case. What did he do? Hacked into companies and the finance department. Right, I remember now. He's a lunatic. Or a genius, depending on how you look at it. We found messages he sent to Vanberg even though he's in prison. And without a computer. What do the messages say? I don't know, they're encrypted. I'd rather read into facial expressions than codes. Which prison is your idol in? Andenne. Is that in the blackout zone? Let me grab my coat! We were waiting in a car not far away. We saw him get in a car and... It happened around 10:30 p.m. You think he had an accomplice on the inside? That's enough questions. There's a press conference tonight. Let us investigate. - Sorry, no one can go in. - We need to talk to an inmate. My orders were to not let anyone go in. OK. We're investigating Dominic Dalmot. Speak to the director then. Laurent Donck, the director. - No more visits today. - We need to talk to Dominic Dalmot. Not possible. He escaped last night. All this for your genius to escape. Opening a door by holding up an officer is too classic. Doing it remotely sounds more fun. He hacked into the no break system and disconnected the cameras so the staff wouldn't see. But you're right. He could've done better. I found a virus in their system. - A big one. - Oh yeah? It overran everything. But I designed a patch. They have work to do. Dalmot was to be released in six months. Why escape now? The blackout and the escape are just the beginning. This will ultimately do some good. It'll bring up the debate on energy security again. We no longer count the stopping and restarting of reactors. Did you read Nassim's notes? The cracks that are overlooked. It freaks me out. Not you? It does. It does? But you don't do a thing. Soon it'll be Chernobyl here, but no one cares. Great. VSSE THE STATE SECURITY SERVICE Good evening, gentlemen. We're looking for this man. Dominic Dalmot. Escaped from Andenne Prison. Yesterday's blackout must've let him escape. The outage caused chaos. He said he felt faint, called an officer and held him at gunpoint. A gun? Where did he get it? Good evening, Minister Vermeer. Mr. Leroy. The gun came from his accomplice: Lambert Hammers. These past six months, Hammers visited Dalmot six or seven times and he must've given him the gun in the visiting room. I know we no longer search inmates after visits, but do you really think he handed him a gun? A gun printed with a 3D printer. It was a toy, but it looked real. He gave it to him in several pieces. Each visit he got a piece, like this one. Then he assembled the gun like a toy in a Kinder Egg. Lambert Hammers probably killed Marc Vanberg. He's prepping something, but we don't know what. Something really bad. Escaping was step one. The malware in the prison is heavy duty. A type of Stuxnet that remotely spies on and reprograms systems. With that, you can control any type of command. She means you can control any keyboard. Turn on any GSM mic to keep someone under surveillance. The best way to spread a virus is to bypass security. Ideally with a blackout. That split second when the machines break down and turn back on is all it takes to introduce the malware. That's right. OK. But to what end? That's what we're looking for. We're not sure. You can figure it out? Absolutely. Alone? Yes. I'll give you 24 hours. But not a word of this to anyone. Got it? - It's me. - Yeah. - Tell them I'll be home soon. - I don't like lying to them, Sam. Tell them I love them. They know you do. Tell them good night then. - Good luck, man. - Thanks, bye. Who was it? Your dad. Don't jump yet. Everything's fine. What if the answer is in Dominic Dalmot's expertise? So he's an amazing coder. And? He was also a pioneer of the Internet. He knew all the programming languages from the 80's. He sent the first email to Belgium. He knows all the peer-to-peer exchange methods. OK, so the guy's a walking encyclopedia. He knew the first connections, hackings, systems of exchange and security systems. He wrote the code for them? No, but he's one of the few people who still knows them. His code was so good it's still used today. In most of the security systems in the country. So Dalmot can remotely control practically... All of the systems in the country. Be careful, we're starting to think alike. The entire country means hospitals, financial groups, banks... Would you flip out if I said nuclear power plants? I think I will jump after all. Wait a bit, it's just a theory. We've got the virus! - What was hit? - I don't know yet. Sensitive institutions must check their systems. Define sensitive. Hospitals, banks, plants, government departments. Impossible, there's too many. Start with those in the blackout zone. The virus' code is FTS. You need to send them its characteristics. I'm on it. Stop, Bob! Get off that thing! It helps him think. Ask them for their systems' spy reports from the past year. Your malware is everywhere. With a patch, they won't get in. Remember Estonia? It was jammed by attacks. I hope that doesn't happen here. Look. There's a hidden code in the encryption. The first two numbers match. Maybe they're dates and times. That works for the first one. It's the exact time of the blackout. - The second is 15 minutes later. - The escape. - And the third one? - Bob. Three hours left! A countdown. Come on. Find the origin of the attack. It's not that simple, Sam. Those guys are pros. They'll slip up eventually. And the Vanberg and Hammers office? Bob is on it. Bob! Bob! OK, thanks. Find anything about the office? I contacted every agency in the city that rents offices monthly or hourly. Nothing. He must've used a fake name. Shit! Sam! - The office was their meeting place? - I'd imagine so. OK. If we collect the GPS data from Vanberg's phone, showing where he went last month... That'll show hundreds of possibilities. But if we cross-refer them with Hammers' GSM data, we'll find the office. I'll call their providers. We don't have time. Hack into them. Let's go! Green is Vanberg. Red, Hammers. Vanberg's wife said it was downtown. That leaves ten. Take out bars, restaurants, any public places. Three possibilities. What's that? - By Porte de Namur. - An abandoned building? A really quiet place. Billie. I'll call the DSU. Bob! You're stressing me out. Go! Go, go, go! Go, go, go... Here. Sam. Now it's clear they want to blow it all up. This isn't right. They're screwing with us. Billie, get out! Get out now! Bob... Call Billie. - Call Billie. - I will. Bob, you got the scans? We received the results from 56% of the sensitive institutions. What did you find? The ones that were hit are in red. - We'll send them to you. - OK, thanks. Sam. The virus is dormant in more than 60 systems in the blackout zone. Emergency services, hospitals, prisons. Toxic chemical factories, national security, the stock exchange, etc. - What are the risks? - Stock market crash. Health disaster. Nuclear accidents. Anything's possible, really. Their intentions are clear. To wreak havoc. I want you to work with our teams. What? Why? Certainly, sir. Do you know where they'll strike? Their pawns are all over. Their first hit could come from anywhere. Are you OK? Yeah... Where's the crapper? - The crapper? - Yeah. Over there. Right. Bob and Nassim are on their way. I'll pop home and meet you back here. - Too much coffee. - Where's Sam? He'll be back. OK... What's going on? - Nothing. - You alright? Yeah. What is this? Iodine? Give some to the kids when they wake up. Take some too. What the hell's going on, Sam? - Take good care of them, OK? - I am. It's almost midnight. We installed virus protection. It should be OK. If you say so. I'm seeing Daniel. Nassim... Danielle? - From the cafeteria? - You mean Nadine? - Is it Nadine? - You're seeing Nadine? Five, four, three, two, one. - We've got a problem. - It's coming from the power plant. What's going on? The reactors' cooling system is down. It's not responding. Move on to the next one. I'm putting the program back together. It's slow. No more firewall. Or any virus protection. You're screwing this up. Send a diagnosis. We have an intrusion. The system isn't responding. I don't understand. The reactors are cooled down. But the system says the opposite. It's a trick. - What? - A trick! - They're trying to lose us. - To distract us. It's moved to the STFI! Attacking a banking system means world finance will collapse. It's a DDoS attack. What does that mean? Zombie computers are sending tons of orders at the same time... The server is jammed by too many orders. Right through the heart, the bastards. Find where they're working. Cut the no break and the power. That did nothing. We can't control the system anymore. - We can't stop anything? - Obviously, the program's in the cloud! Nothing you can do? - Cut the country's power supply. - Like in Estonia. They've embezzled a fortune. They're just interested in money. No, they're donations to Greenwald, Snowden, Assange. FORWARDING We're going to make history. That's amazing... They're giving it out randomly. FORWARDING It's the heist of the century, guys. - Hurry up, let's get out of here. - OK. - What do we do, Sam? - Nothing here! Our machines are too advanced. These old programs need old machines to work? Yeah. Where can we find old computers? At the junkyard. - Or a museum. - Exactly. The IT museum. OK, let's pack up. Hammers! Put down your gun. Drop it! Drop it! Who has the most power? A finger on a control or a trigger? RUN? YES/NO Step away from that. A click or a bang? - You serve a corrupt power! - You'll put it in order? Trigger a reaction. By destroying 30 billion? We'll wake up the world with money, not speeches. Why kill Vanberg? Marc? Is that true? He got in my way! You killed him? He feigned chaos! We are the real deal! You piece of shit! You hear me? You're a piece of shit! - No! - Billie! Sam! Not the machine! Go! Good luck, Th3m1s! The code! Th3m1s? The power belongs to the technicians! Billie, hurry up. Shit! The virus is spreading! We got this. Only one way to fix this. We'll have to explain this to a committee. I take full responsibility. I talked to the Committee P. They'll suspend Billie. Are you kidding? - Do they know about the last 24 hours? - Of course. They congratulate you. But? From the State Security Service. What's this? For an investigation. They found a Trojan horse in their system. From the same day as the photo. - She can explain. - I'll call her in tomorrow. We'll see what she has to say. Let's go have a toast in the cafeteria. I'll be right there. Sorry, Sam. - I know she means a lot to you. - No, she doesn't. She does good work, that's all. Good work... This is not how we work. Yeah! - It's really cool working with you. - Yeah. - You alright? - Fine, just the after-effects. K4oS Really? Hello! Cheers! Damn it... Subtitle translation by Louise Layman
