His room is a mess. -They must have come back over here to take clothes. Patricia's murder was premeditated, not the kidnapping of the little one. -Come to see ! There are many others. Axelle had been following them for 2 years. It's her behind Angela's nickname and it was she who sent message to Patricia for the meeting in the parakeet house. -Do we have any news from Billie? -We found his motorbike and debris of the phone. It is surely his. -The blood on the floor ... ... was it hers? -I sent a sample to the lab. -What the fuck did she do? I must call Hélène. -Guys ! Music -You should have told us that Axelle was your mistress. -It was not my mistress. Patricia and I were separated. -Patricia was aware of this relationship? -No. I didn't want her to use it to obtain custody of Leah. -Since when were you dating Axelle Lemans? -2 years. Maybe more... Screams -I can't believe that she did that. We met in tennis, one evening at the bar. I was with friends, she approached me. It immediately hooked. We saw each other every week there. We talked for hours. She said that she had never felt also close to someone. I felt like I was special. One day we talked to start a family. I believed it. -We think Axelle was using you. To get closer to Léa. Was she talking to you about Lea? -Yes. She told me that Patricia mistreated her by exposing it on the Net. It must be protected. She did not have an easy start in life. -Yet, Lea doesn't seem to lack anything. -No. We always loved her like she was our own daughter. -What do you mean? -We adopted it. At birth. -This too you should have told us! -We look alike, don't we? -Yes. -Are you my mother? Music -I'm sorry that it happens like this. Music You do not have to to call me "mom". Not immediately. When you feel like it, okay? -Can you give me my phone? -It's not worth it. Do not worry ! Your daddy knows you're here. We're not gonna stay here long. -I'm hungry. -You are hungry? What do you want to eat? -Fries... -Fries ! Noise Not moving ! Bob knocks. -DNA correspondence. Axelle is the biological mother of Léa? -You found the file. -Yes. Léa Remacle was entrusted to adoption 2 days after birth. January 6, 2008. The Remacle family collected it a month later. The file is thin. Axelle must not want that Lea finds her. In any case, not at the time. However, Léa created this page ... -But why Axelle made contact with Léa under the nickname of Angela? And not live? -She wanted to take it easy. Or even say nothing. -Or Axelle seduces Pierre fantasizing about family life and kill Patricia to have the way clear. -Or to avenge his daughter of Patricia's abuse. Keep looking! I will go to the nursery where Axelle worked. Complaints -You still try something, I shoot! Billie mumbles. -Shhh! Hush! Shut up ! I take that away from you and you don't scream! You're not screaming! -Axelle, you can't kill me, think about it! I am from the police. I am your pass. -It's me who decides ! -Call my colleagues! We will negotiate. Okay? Give me some water. Axelle, please! -You are still trying something ... I swear to you, I kill you! Music -She took good care of the children. Sometimes a little too much. -That is to say? -As if they were his. -And with the team? -Always away. She was not there only for children. -You find that she was too invested? -Yes, that was excessive. Parents complained that Axelle teach them a lesson for nails that are too long or clothes that are too small. She didn't understand that we allow certain people to have children and that it is refused to others. -You saw her when for the last time? -A month ago. Axelle was dismissed after a violent argument with a parent. -What had she done? -She had locked up a child in the dormitory. So that his father wakes him up from a nap.

You untie me? I won't run away. I just need to pee. -I can't, sorry. -You can't stay here Léa. You have to go. Your father is worried. He doesn't know you're there. -Yes, she told him. -No Lea, she's lying to you. She's crazy. You have to get out of here. -She says it's you who is crazy. -Lea ... I'm a cop. And Axelle makes a big mistake. -No... Axelle, this is my real mother. We finally found each other. Music -OKAY. You untie me? -No. -Léa please! -The address of Axelle's parents. -The blood on the sidewalk ... ... it's Billie's. -Shit ! -What? -I no longer have my gun. -What do you mean? -She was there yesterday! -Billie has your code? -She has all my codes. -Fucking Nassim! Music and siren -I had the same. The first flat screen. -Axelle liked computers. -We haven't touched anything since that she left home. -At what age? -16 years old. -Is it at the time of childbirth? -Just after. -We haven't seen her since. We lost contact. -Why Axelle did not keep the child? -She was 16 years old. It was the best thing to do. When we knew that she was pregnant, we went to family planning but it was too late. The legal deadline had passed. It was better to entrust the baby to someone else. -Axelle ended the pregnancy here. We did everything so that she gives birth discreetly and resume a normal life. -And who is the child's father? -Her boyfriend at the time. -Do you know his name? -Axelle never introduced him to us. Don't hurt her! Axelle is not mean. You don't move from here. If Axelle contacts you, you have my number. Alarm Shit ! Bob! Music -OKAY. Thank you ! The patrols know about it. They will let us know.
