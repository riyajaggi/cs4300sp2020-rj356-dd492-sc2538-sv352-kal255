 CAUTION - HUNTING AREA - LIVE FIRE No! Come on! Slow down! Oscar's sleeping. - Hi, Tom! - Hi. Robin, your homework. I start later tomorrow. Can I take the bus? No, I'll drop you off. But my friends take it. I'll drop you off at school as usual. Dad, I'm 13!

 What's with all the messages? Nothing. - Robin, your homework! - Oscar is still sleeping. - Emmy, phone off! - It's yours. Hey, Robin, stop changing my ringtone. Yes? Send me the address and I'll be there. - You can sleep here tonight. - No, Sam! No! Sam! Oscar's up. A naturalist tipped us off. He observes the clearing with mini-cameras hidden all over the place. A woman. Young, 25-30 years old.

 The time stamp on the video reads October 29th at 4:03 p.m. Fifteen days. It's Alice. She went back to the lab with samples. - Hello. - Bob. Woman, young, 25-30 years old. She died after being set on fire. With gas. Did you get any prints? Is that still possible? Yes, she's on file. We'll send you the file. - Nothing else? - We can't see much on the video. - Shouting, gunshots and then smoke. - Bullets? - That's what they're looking for. - No bullets in the ashes. The bullets must've gone through her body to God-knows-where. It's Chloé Miller. Know her? No. Chloé Miller, 25 years old. Computer engineer. - Why is she on file? - For hacking into Investment Corp. She's suspected of having tampered with employee data. She was known for making a stand. An Anonymous. Investment Corp, what do they do? Investment funds. Two years ago, they ruined half their clients, retired folk and small fry. Don't you remember? The Anonymous threatened the company for them to pay their clients back. It wasn't taken seriously and... Three days later, they made the traders' emails public. That was quite a revelation! Adultery, drugs, sex games. - They caused a shitstorm. - That's right. Hiding behind their keyboards. At least they fight for their ideals. They end up doing more harm than good! There was no proof that Chloé was involved. I looked into it. Supposing that she was involved, maybe one of her victims wanted to get even. - One of the traders. - I checked, there are 22 of them. They were all at the meeting that day. Chloé Miller lived with a Max Neeffs. The son of Léon Neeffs, co-founder of Doctors for All with Paul Miller. Chloé Miller's father. Did you look into that too? Exactly. FEAR US THE TRUTH WILL OUT So, Chloé Miller wasn't an Anonymous? There's no membership card. It's an ideology. - Anyone can claim to be an Anonymous. - And you? How do they know? They see everything. Hey, hey! He removed his license plate. Why didn't you report her missing straight away? It's been 15 days. I thought she was on vacation. With her boyfriend. - Give that back. - It's pointless. Even coked up, the pain won't go away. My mother died when I was three. Chloé's mom raised me. And then she died too. We were 12! I know, Max, I know. Our dads were always off somewhere around the world looking after other people's kids! Doctors for All? Yes. Is that Chloé's office? Here. Is this her boyfriend? Guru. He's the one who killed her! He didn't treat her right. I kept telling Chloé to end it, but she wouldn't listen. Fuck. If I'd insisted, she wouldn't be dead! This will take a while. It's ironclad. If I find Guru, I swear I'll kill him! I'll kill him! Meet... Guru. What? Sylvain Englebert, Chloé Miller's boyfriend. IT college professor. He calls himself "Guru". Some folks have no fear. - OK. - Be warned: it gets poetic. Silence is the ultimate prison. Staying quiet is a form of giving up. So, let's make sure that speech is free. - Always. - Hold on, that's nothing. It gets worse. Woman always encourages man to compromise himself. She pulls the strings with her vagina. Salem was right: send women to the stake! We're gonna be friends. I'll stay calm. Wanna go for a drink after work? Yeah. What time? - See you later! - See you in a bit, yeah. "Salem wasn't wrong: send women to the stake." - Seriously? - Freedom of speech. It's good for spotting misogynists. That quote didn't come from me, it came from Guru. - But Guru is you. - It's my avatar. A troll, yes. - Who encourages burning women. - It's provocative. And it clearly works. Is this provocative? That's what's left of your girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend. We broke up three weeks ago. You guys had a vacation planned the day she died. I had no intention of going. She was overly clingy. Pathetic. What was Chloé doing with that jerk? That girl stood up to a multinational... and was a doormat to that asshole? - You, me, later? - Who do you think you are? Feisty. He's a manipulator. The more you resist, the more it turns him on. Love's a beautiful thing. Right. That's why I kick them out after one night. - Do you know what Chloé was working on? - No. Only that she became totally paranoid. What were you doing on September 29th at 4 p.m.? I don't have to tell you. No, that's true. I was giving a class... in front of around 100 students. I'll gladly check that out. Today's special with sauce on the side. Today's special, but no sauce for me. Alstublieft. Dank U, Nadine. - I don't think Nadine likes you much. - I think Nadine likes sauce. Enjoy! Your Guru's alibi has been confirmed. - He was giving a class. - That doesn't mean anything. Maybe he sent someone to do his dirty work. He would've done it himself. Otherwise where's the fun? - Anything on the computers? - They're ironclad. Tamper-proof security doesn't exist. Chloé had got in touch with a journalist. Renaud Ghekhière. He's well-known. He's obsessed with conspiracies. She was supposed to meet him on the day she died. WE WON'T KEEP QUIET Fuck's sake! Disconnect everything! WE WON'T KEEP QUIET Shut it down! Sam! Billie! What is this mess? We were attacked. Nothing was deleted. Nothing was taken either. It was a warning. You promised this wouldn't happen. Tamper-proof security doesn't exist! We've isolated the malware. - Who did this? - Anonymous. No, we don't know that. Here, don't lose it this time. Chloé Miller's father is on the line. - Paul Miller? - His company has been hacked. DG Sanco? - Two attacks at the same time. - Scary. Yes, excuse me. That company authorizes the circulation of medicine. I thought he worked with Léon Neeffs at Doctors for All? He co-founded it, but stopped working there. DOCTORS FOR ALL A fall? The meniscus. It was bad timing, but I couldn't delay the operation. The two attacks are different. This one is a lot more complex than the one at the Unit. WE DON'T FORGIVE OR FORGET, FEAR US! MILLER THE MURDERER. You're being accused of murder. What do you think? That I killed my daughter? You think I would do that? Did your daughter have any dealings with your company? I asked her to help when we had security problems on the server. She fixed everything in under a week. She was talented. I wasn't around a lot. I definitely made mistakes... but I loved my daughter. There, your system has been secured. Thank you. I've still got to find out who's behind the attack. What was it about the Anonymous that appealed to you? This again? - Did you have an alias? - No. - Kill Bill, is that it? - Oh, very funny! Police! Police! - You sure this is it? - I know the area. He could only be here. It looks dead here... Get back! Stay there. - Sam, no! - Put your gun down! You too! What are you doing? I'll shoot the girl! Shoot. It'll teach her not to hide things. He's gonna kill us! Talk. It's your last chance. Fuck off! OK, I worked at Investment Corp. Chloé wanted someone on the inside. - Did you hack into the traders' accounts? - No! - I refused, I was leaving the company. - Fuck off! Thank you very much. That's enough. - What? - It's a two-shot gun. He didn't reload it. Don't shoot! I don't know anything! I have a wife and kids. It's OK... Let's all calm down. Nobody wants to kill anyone. Police. We know who you are. It's about the murder of Chloé Miller. - Was she murdered? - Where you were supposed to meet. They're going to kill me too. I have to go. Stay here! Who wants to kill you? The people who killed Chloé! - They're going to know I spoke to you. - Why did Chloé contact you? She said that she'd discovered something. Something big. She wanted to expose it. - What was it? - I don't know! She told me to meet at the clearing to hand me the proof. Where's the proof? I don't have it. When I got there, there were gunshots so... - I left. - That means you were being watched. Chloé took precautions, they may have found out through him. Chloé's car has been found. I'll let you go, but I'm taking this. The bullets found at the clearing are a 7.65 Parabellum. Shot from a Luger 1901. It has no relation to this. Get me a list of everyone who's registered a Luger 1901. How's the no-smoking going? Bijou wants me to start up again. Am I being that weird? No. Nothing on the journalist's laptop. The killer didn't find out through him. We got into Chloé's laptop, but she'd already done a clean-up. She must have hidden the documents somewhere else. OK. What are they looking for? A USB key, a hard drive... Where do you stash your secrets? Nada. Nothing on Chloé's laptop, nothing in her car. The killer has the proof that Chloé Miller wanted to give to the journalist. And the hacking at DG Sanco? I have to go back there. Call me if need be. Dad! - Here, this is for you. - Cool. I made it for you. Like it? It's awesome! - Where were you? - At school. - Why were you outside? - I was saying bye to Violette. - I'm confiscating this. - No! She'll call back. - You heard me. - But Dad, I need it. We're going to wean you off. Did you see what I did? Yes, Billie? I'll drop the kids off and head there. Come on! - I'm here if you need anything. - Thanks. So? What? Is it the investigation that's put you in this mood? It's my daughter. A guy? She's 13! So, it's a guy. I was right. We were attacked by Anonymous. Here is the other hacker. There was a crack in the security which dates before Chloé's death, but after she worked here. It was an inside job. - IT security? - I don't know. Why do it from your desk? Not this time. Thibaut Denis. 25 years old. Cleaner at DG Sanco for the last two years. I'm not gonna talk. I want a deal first. You're in no position to negotiate. If I talk, will you drop the hacking charges? We can't make that kind of deal. So, I won't talk. You just told us that you hacked into something. What did you hack into? Are you the mole at DG Sanco? OK. Sorry. Is that a USB key? It's mine! It's yours. Chloé had the same bracelet on in the photo. You were her back-up. ENCRYPTED FILES It would be no fun otherwise. Once you've understood the way a hacker thinks, it's child's play. And you knew her well. Drop it, Sam. Thibaut: a cleaner and an Anonymous. The Anonymous are everywhere. Even among cops? Especially among cops! And my work is done! Cayman International Bank. - Was anyone at DG Sanco receiving bribes? - Yeah, and not just anyone. Chloé had found out that her father was corrupt. Hi! You haven't seen Sam by any chance? - Over there. - Thanks. We've been looking for you for an hour. He couldn't have killed his own daughter. Chloé Miller works for her father at DG Sanco. She realizes that Mariamman Pharma, a huge Indian lab, is bribing him so that their drugs get green-lighted. She saves all the proof between her dad and the lab and, as a precaution, gives them to Thibaut Denis. OK. Would she have asked him to hack into DG Sanco? Her dad's company? To attract attention and blow the whistle. It would've been easier to come to us. If all labs were in the public domain, this wouldn't be happening. Without profits, we'd still be in the Stone Age. No vaccinations, no treatments. Remind me never to call on you when I'm depressed. OK. No vaccinations. Ridiculous. There we go. Paul Miller was spying on his daughter. The spy software was hidden in a birthday e-card he sent her. That's messed up. I never would've thought to look there! I can't believe it. Some guy who spends the day saving kids kills his own daughter? Some folks are crazy. How did he know about Ghekhière? From the spy software, no doubt about it. All Miller had to do was go there and kill his daughter. Candy for whoever guesses who registered a Luger 1901. Paul Miller. Private stash. Forensics are at Miller's looking for the gun and a patrol car will bring him here. Is this yours? Yes. And the account in the Cayman Islands? Replenished by Indian lab, Mariamman Pharma, is that yours too? Yes. Is that what Chloé found? Partially. What happened Mr. Miller? We know what happened. Chloé found out that daddy wasn't perfect. He didn't like that. - I never hurt my daughter. - No. You're more into the business of crappy drugs and fucking up the health of thousands. That's not what happened. We're listening. When Chloé came to work for us, she found out about the Indian lab. I begged her to keep quiet. Was she going to expose it? She was asking for trouble! I had to protect her. - You silenced her. - I never touched that money! - You can check. - So, what did you do, Mr. Miller? You don't get it. Not really, no. Chloé wanted to take down the lab. For that and for the illegal testing they were doing on children. I was willing to help her. But we needed proof so we were gathering it. The lab must have found out. You want us to buy that the Indian lab killed Chloé? You don't know what's at stake for them. Supposing that Mariamman Pharma is involved. Who told them that Chloé had found out? - Apart from you? - It wasn't me! I'm next on the list. Me or Léon. Léon Neeffs. How's he involved? He was the middle-man between us and the lab. He negotiated the initial contracts. There's no proof of this. Léon Neeffs didn't send Chloé a booby-trapped e-card. He also didn't know about the meeting. It was you, Mr. Miller. The murder weapon was at your house. Do what you have to do. My daughter's dead. Ballistics confirmed it: the Luger found at Paul Miller's is the one that killed Chloé. - Case closed. - He killed his own daughter? There's something I don't get: why did Paul Miller say that Léon Neeffs is involved? To minimize his own involvement. And he kept the weapon? Would he be IT-savvy enough to trick a hacker like Chloé? They dissected everything at Doctors for All. The records, the accounts. We didn't find anything. I say Chloé's father is guilty. There's coded text in the e-card which shouldn't be there. Meaning? Meaning Paul Miller didn't send his daughter the e-card. Shit. But it was sent from his office. He wasn't in his office at the time. - The GPS data gives his location... - OK. 100 % sure. Max Neeffs. No! It could be him. He's an IT engineer. He knows Paul Miller very well. - He'd know where to find the weapon. - Why would Max want to kill Chloé? To protect his father and avoid a scandal. If Max was spying on Chloé, he knew where to wait to kill her. It's not Max. Max? Nothing to report! Billie? Could you look into something? DOCTORS FOR ALL Find out who this car belongs to. It's Léon Neeffs'. Neeffs. What's it doing there? Locate his GSM. In the forest. Bob, could you send backup to the clearing? Where Chloé was murdered. - Max, let's talk. - I have nothing to say to you! - We can talk. - Shut up! No, don't be stupid! Don't do that! - Think! Everything will work out. - Shut up! - Don't do this. - Shut up! Shut it! - Max, stop that! - Don't come any closer! - Help me! - Shut up! - He's going to set me on fire! - Shut it! - He killed Chloé! - We know that, Max. No! - She should've stayed out of it! - Shut up! Max, we know everything. He has to pay. He will pay. Max... Max, look at me. Look. Billie, no. Max, put that down. Max. Put it down. Chloé loved you. She talked about you all the time. All the time. You were the only one who understood her. Max, look at me. Stop. Look at me. Do as they say, Max. Shut up! Billie, come back. - It's my fault. - It's not. - It's my fault she's dead. - Stop. Remember what she'd say? It's not about the fight, it's about doing it for the right reason. Max... Max, stop. Max... - It's my fault. - No. No. Stop! He told Max that he was worried about Chloé because of Guru. Léon Neeffs had no scruples. Manipulating his son to kill Chloé. He knew that Max was worried too, so he asked him to discreetly keep an eye on Chloé. That's how he installed the spy software in the birthday card. Exactly. And Neeffs knew that Chloé was onto him. - How? - Mrs. Janssen? Yes, I'm coming. She spoke to him. She thought he would side with their cause. She walked right into the lion's den. Exactly. OK. Thanks, Sam. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. Are you OK? No. Apparently you get used to it. But that's not true. What an idiot. Sorry. Yes? Mr. Leroy? Speaking. I'm calling you to get a sick note for Emmy. A sick note, why? She hasn't been to school for three days. - Three days? - Yes. Yes. OK, thank you. Goodbye. Are you OK? - Thanks for taking the car. - It's fine, it's on my way home. Sam, are you OK? She hasn't been to school for three days. Emmy? - Is Emmy there? - Upstairs, why? I put Oscar to bed. Clean diaper, fed, he's out for the count. - You must be Billie? - And you the nanny. The brother. I'm helping out. See you. - Can I watch TV? - No. - Yes! - I said no! Thanks! Emmy. Dad! I knocked, you didn't answer. What's going on? Nothing, they're friends. - Friends who insult you? - You went through my phone? - This is bad. - You can't go through my things! - Emmy. - It's none of your business! The school called. Are you going to explain? I posted some pictures. Which pictures? The ones at the pool. We were posing just for fun. Now they're name-calling you? Has it been going on for a while? How long, Emmy? A month. I'll go see your principal tomorrow, and your teacher. I'll speak to them. And your friends too. - Goddammit, Emmy, a month! - You're never here! We'll fix this. OK? This has got to stop. - I'm so lame. - You're not lame, honey. You're not lame. You're just prettier and smarter than the rest of them. Mom used to do that. YOU WERE LIKE MY SISTER. FOR ALL THOSE OUTRAGED BY INJUSTICE... THE FIGHT CONTINUES. TH3M1S
