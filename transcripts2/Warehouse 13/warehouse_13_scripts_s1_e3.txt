 PETE: Previously on Warehouse 13... Arthur Nielsen. You can call me Artie. I'm thrilled you're on the team. What team? What is this place? You're both joining me as fellow gatherers and protectors of secrets. Bering, Mr. Lattimer, welcome to Warehouse 13. Can we get back to the Warehouse computers being breached? Somebody is poking around in your system. Warehouse 13! I got hacked! (GRUNTS)

 Myka, I could use a hand down here. MYKA: I'm distracting the gendarmes first. That was the plan, remember? Did you switch out the blade yet? If I had, I wouldn't be calling you, would I? Hang tight. Be there in two. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) (SCREAMS) MYKA: Pete, time's up! Come on. Almost there. Now I've got you. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (BEEPING) Damn it.

 Very nice. You must be super fun on a date. Guys love that, all kickass action and no talking. I switched the blade. You didn't follow the plan. Now hurry before they get up. I'm sorry. Newsflash. Your plan wasn't working. Are you forgetting something? Let's go. I was just keeping you on your toes. MYKA: Right. It's always my toes. What about your toes? (CHATTERING ON COMPUTER) REPORTER 1:ripped through areas in and around Baghdad... REPORTER 2:to assist Hungary in avoiding... (VIOLIN PLAYING) MAN: Sister Grace. MAN 1: You believe this? MAN 2: Sister Grace, come down! WOMAN: Somebody stop her! MAN 3: Come on now, Sister Grace... Call the sheriff. GIRL: You've gotta see this. (BEEPING) GIRL: You've gotta see this. MAN: Don't jump! WOMAN: Sister Grace, come down! FEMALE REPORTER: Miraculously, Sister Grace Ellen only suffered minor injuries and is listed in stable condition at a local hospital here in Unionville. Adele Porro, Channel 6 News. What's going on there in Unionville? PETE: Okay, Marie Antoinette guillotine blade, bagged, tagged and on the shelf. MYKA: Congratulations, but remember to charge the Tesla next time. Are you still going on about the Tesla? No, Pete, what I am going on about is protocol. I mean, you do know how to read, don't you? You know, when you frown, that premature wrinkle line in your forehead gets a little more prominent. MYKA: You just hate it when I'm right. PETE: Thank God that never happens. You know what I don't get about you... Guys. How I wake up in the morning looking this good? No, no, Pete, what I don't get is your pathological need to ignore authority. Guys. Okay? Guys, can you hear me? You were not in charge in Paris. Well, neither were you. Well, better than you. What is that? You are like a child! Watch your negative energy. You're like an uptight control freak! The Warehouse will do bad things. No, no, no, don't do it. Don't you do it. Thank you very much, Miss Community College. (RUMBLING) Miss Community College? Six, six, six, four, nine, six... (BOTH CHATTERING) PETE: What about your parents? I suggest you close your eyes. It had to be done. (LAUGHING) ARTIE: You know, it's gonna have who knows what consequences, and as I keep telling you repeatedly, all things have a magnetic context, especially things in that warehouse. Pete, Pete, you cannot go into that place with so much negative energy. You want to fight with her? Fine, fight with her, but not there. One of us has to be in charge out in the field, don't you think? You haven't listened to a word I've said, have you? Yeah, yeah, I'm just saying somebody leads, somebody follows. Right? I mean, I have more experience, more know-how. I'm more grounded. Pete, you're the obvious choice here. Well... No, no, no. Do me a favor, will you? You let Myka think that she's running things because, really, she's very, very, very sensitive. Sometimes I just want to punch him. He reminds me of my father, you know. He's arrogant. I think he's kind of sexy. He's so not my type. Really? What's your type? I don't know, Leena. Opposable thumbs, maybe. Hello, ladies. We're not interrupting girl talk, are we? Like now, see, I could punch him right now. ARTIE: All right, game time. Come on. Come on. PETE: Come on! ARTIE: A nun, a teenager and an old lady all acting very strangely in Unionville, Colorado. I have research here that indicates that each of these people knew exactly what they were doing. The thing is, they couldn't stop themselves from doing it for some reason. Well, could there be a practical explanation? Something in the water... Nothing. I checked. Maybe it's just a bad flu bug. Well, only three cases in a town of thousands indicates it was something non-viral, although I still need to rule out anything bacterial, parasitic, prionic, viroidic and of course fungal. I was kidding. No, no, never rule out anything until you've ruled it out. And I want you guys to ask each of the victims my list of field-recovery questions. Artie, not the questions. Yeah. Please. They're embarrassing. ARTIE: Yeah. My only pleasure left in life, concocting ways to embarrass you. Here, in case you lost them. Take this. You know, how can it matter if a person smells fudge before an incident? Yeah, or if your gallbladder is feeling numb? Humor me. All right, I want you to go to Unionville, find out if these three people are connected in some way, and if they are, is there an artifact at the center of it? If there is, bring it home. Simple. Easy peasy. Oh, Transpo. My truck's still in Lake Michigan. God, that was cold. Word. (SIGHS) All right, take my car. Just no food, no drink, don't go over 55, don't park near anything. What? After a certain age, a person likes to have a nice car. Artie. Yeah? One of us needs to be in charge. Somebody has to run point. You. Good, then we're both on the same page. Of course, Myka. I mean, you're the obvious choice. Just do me a favor, please. Let Pete think that he's running things. He's very, very touchy. I can make that work. Good. So, any news on the breach at the Warehouse? There's been no breach. Just a two-bit hacker who's going nowhere. Well, after the dead-end at Dickinson's, it looks like you're the one that's getting nowhere. I, my dear, am choosing to ignore this irritating pest. I suggest you do the same. There could be a probable explanation. High-tension power lines, a nearby chemical spill. People just don't go crazy. Uh-huh. Why don't you go to the local county records office? See if you can pull the geographics. Then I will go... How about we just talk to folks and get a vibe for the town first? (LAUGHS) We need a plan, Pete. Something with a little more logic and a little less Kumbaya. Or we could just, you know, improvise. (GLASS SHATTERS) Do you... (CAR HORN HONKING) Fifty cents? Can you believe that? See what happens. Okay, now we have a plan. No. Now we improvise. DOCTOR: Man, I mean, always blaming the other guy. This patient weighed 300 pounds, you know. He smoked like a chimney, all he ate was butter. He was dead before he got to us. Now it's my fault he had a heart attack? He was dead before he got to us! Excuse me. My husband died of a... To hell with them. You know, what do they know? Would you mind, please? Lady, I'm on a break, okay? Do you mind? MAN: Hey, who's there talking with you? What? I don't know. Some old lady looking for free medical advice probably. (SIRENS WAILING) (SIGHS) No, Meg. Mmm-hmm? I don't think that it's your high blood-pressure medicine that's causing this. I'm so embarrassed. My daughter will be furious. You know, it could be... Receptor or channel blockers can cause dizziness, or it could be a sugar imbalance. I noticed your diabetic pendant. You a doctor? No, I just know a lot. Well, her insulin levels are good. It's not her meds. Besides, Meg's not the only one to go off the deep end lately. Really? That's one crazy old lady in there, huh? Oh, no. Meg's an eighth grade English teacher. She's as sane as I am. Wait a minute. She spends all day with 13-year-olds and one bluetool sends her over the edge? I guess everybody has their limit. Any similarities between her, the flying nun and that violinist kid? What did you say you were doing in Unionville? My wife and I are just passing through, you know. We're on our honeymoon, so... Anybody mention smelling fudge or... What exactly do you do for a living, Mr... Pete. I'm Pete. And you're... DISPATCHER ON RADIO: Hey, Mac. Mac. Everybody around here just calls me Mac. We got another situation. What's up, Sal? Tommy Wilson was caught trying to set the music room on fire. Principal wants you to come down. On my way, Sal. Have a nice honeymoon. Honeymoon? Why would you say that? I wanted a cover. Don't want to say who we are just yet, you know? We stay on the down-Iow, we operate more freely. Okay, you just can't run around town saying whatever comes into your head. We have to stay under the radar, remember? Stealth? Well, covers are like the definition of stealth, plus I'm very good at them. You're 10 years old. You are 10 years old. You know, I'm gonna go interview the nun. Fine. Sounds like the violinist kid is getting worse, so I'm gonna go check that out, if that's all right with you, Sarge. You're eight years old. I knew I could fly. I just knew it. Where were you before you jumped? I had just left the center. Sister Grace works most days at a battered women's shelter. Have you received any jewelry of any kind recently? Any gifts? Anything new? We are nuns. We renounce worldly possessions. Of course. Right. Did you know Tommy Wilson or Meg Riley? Not really. Is Tommy all right? Yes, I just thought maybe... I can fly. I can. Can I talk to you outside for a second? Will you excuse us? PETE: Hey, Mac. Hey, sorry to bother you, but can I ask you a few questions about the Wilson kid? That's a strange way to spend your honeymoon there, Pete. Lattimer. Agent Pete Lattimer. Secret Service. Secret Service? I hope you're not flashing that badge all over town and scaring folks. No one's trying to scare anybody. I got enough problems around here lately without people thinking this is some kind of terrorist plot. (CHUCKLES) There's no plot. Look, Mac, if you just let me do my job, no one will be hurt... No, sir. Not if your job is sneaking around lying to folks. I don't trust people who lie to me. I just need to ask Tommy a few questions. Tommy Wilson slipped into a coma about an hour ago. Now, can the Secret Service explain that? Because the doctors sure as hell can't. I noticed that Sister Grace was wearing one of those rubber bracelets for domestic violence awareness. Yes, she came to us about a year ago. I can't go into details, but there was a fair amount of abuse. I'm sorry. Has she been depressed lately? I mean, I'm assuming this incident is new behavior. Well, she hasn't jumped off any other buildings, if that's what you mean. Of course not. It's just... I'd really like her to get some rest, if that's all right with you. Right. Sure. Thank you, Father. Sister Grace? WOMAN: Oh, my God! Look! MAN: What's she doing up there? Sister Grace! The wind. Sister! Stay there, Sister. I'm coming up. Sister! I can fly. You cannot fly! Grace Ellen! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) ARTIE: (ON PHONE) So wait, the snow bank saved her life? Yeah, I mean, Sister Grace is alive, but she's all busted up from the fall. Should put the snow bank in the Warehouse. Okay, sounds like it's intensifying. Is Tommy still in a coma? Yeah, yeah, I was just over there. The doctor said he just kind of shut down. Okay, well, that sounds like it's causing some kind of regression. You gotta find this thing fast before it gets worse. You got that? Uh-huh. Yeah. Have you ever seen anything like this? Well, actually, once. There was this little bell, and what it did is it made people laugh. Well, that doesn't sound very dangerous. Oh, yeah? Well, the victims would ultimately laugh themselves to death. Cardiac arrest due to asphyxiation. Freaky. So what you're saying is there's always a link? Always. And you just keep looking under rocks, and I'll do what I can from here, okay? Book on tape. It's always mind control. (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) Hey! I have work to do! Okay. (BUZZING) Okay. That's that. (BUZZING CONTINUES) Now cut that out. Thanks. You didn't get that from me. I'm running a business here. Hey. Hey. So nothing connects. Tommy never had Meg as a teacher, Meg doesn't know Sister Grace, and Sister Grace taught Sunday school, but Tommy never took it. So they're all doing things completely out of character? So, if someone does something totally opposite from what they normally do... Drugs. Although the old lady and the nun don't strike me as crackheads. Not so much. Hey, I thought the medic might know something, so I asked him to meet me after work. Good idea. I got a thing to do, but, Myka, I want you to be careful. I want you to use a condom. That's hilarious. (CLEARS THROAT) Thanks for taking the time. No worries. The wife's taking care of the twins, so... Oh, congratulations. Six months. They say it gets easier. Do you want to sit down? Yeah, sure. Sorry I'm late, by the way. It's been such a weird day. Did something else happen? Do you remember Meg? From the coffee shop? Let me guess, she went a little crazier, right? Yeah. In the middle of a planning meeting for a children's carnival, she threw a lamp at Father Braid. Was he hurt? He's all right. I was just at his office. A couple of stitches and she broke her wrist, but the weird thing is, they're really good friends. Father Braid helped her through the loss of her husband last year. Did he die at the hospital where Meg threw the urn? In the emergency room. He had a heart attack. Okay, so... Hey. Hey, I'm up here. MAN: Hey. Hi. I'm Dave. I haven't seen you around before. You new? Eight years, actually. I'm just passing through town. I'm Pete. Welcome, Pete. It's a great meeting. Good. I could use one tonight. All right, meeting time. Take a seat if you can, please. Welcome to the Saturday Night Solutions meeting. My name is Ellis. I'm an alcoholic. ALL: Hi, Ellis. And I'll be your leader for tonight. Can you think of anything these people have in common? I can't. Meg isn't even from Unionville. She's from Colton. That could be important. How far is... Can I just touch these? Hey! LUIS: Ross! I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I don't even know why I'd do that. I've never done anything like that before. I'm married. I told you, right? I have twins. I told you that. Wait a second. Just wait a second. Can I just touch this one? Ow! Okay, I think I know what's going on here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That hurts. I don't know why I keep doing that. I believe you, I'd just rather you didn't do it again, okay? Ross, you lost your balance. Lost what? Right before you just... You lost your balance. So did Meg before she threw that guy through the glass and Tommy in the video. What are you saying? You've got it. Whatever this is, you've been affected, too. And if not for this program taking it one day at a time, I'd have been dead 22 years ago, but I was willing to do anything to keep from taking that next drink. Anything. So if you... ELLIS: Dave, you all right? MAN: What's going on, Dave? Dave? Excuse me. Dave! ROSS: Thank you for this. No problem. Okay, so we know that you've been in contact with Meg. What about Sister Grace or Tommy Wilson? No, I don't even know Tommy, and I've only seen the Sister at church. (SIGHS) Hey, Dave, what are you doing here? (GLASS SHATTERING) MYKA: Pete? PETE: Hang on, Myka. Thanks, Pete. Yeah, it's all right, man. Dave, put it down! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, no, no! Dave, what are you doing? Yeah, you got over 20 years, man. What's up? Did something happen to you? Why? Who are you? He's Pete. Pete, this is Ellis Hayes, my therapist. Oh, for crying out loud. (SCREAMS) Okay! I'm sorry, I won't do it again. I won't touch your breasts anymore. What are you doing? We talked about this. Wait, you talked to Ross? Wait a minute, do you treat an old lady named Meg and a teenage violinist? I can't discuss my patients with you. We got a lot of questions for you, pal. Dave! Dave! Dave... PETE: What the hell? Uncuff me. We need to get him to a hospital right away. LUIS: Call 911. Okay, so what, now Dave is in a coma, too? Yeah, he collapsed right in front of us. The doctors are bringing in some specialists. Well, I doubt that specialist is going to be any help. I think this thing ultimately shuts down the central nervous system. I'm worried it's gonna go further and shut down their body entirely. What about that therapist? Yeah, I'm going to see him now. And I'm gonna go see Father Braid, see if I can get some details about when Sister Grace went into therapy. Maybe it's time related. Time? No, no, no, no, no. The pattern of behavior here is the result of individual contact with the same artifact. Something they found. They might have seen it. Probably they touched it. What am I looking for? Anything that might cause an electrical or chemical imbalance in the brain. Well, so, a brain imbalancer. That's easy. It's probably right next to his time-travel machine. No, no. Trust yourselves. You're gonna know it when you see it. That's why we chose you. Instinct and observation. (WHISTLE BLOWING) You're a great team. What... What is that? Where are you? We are at an ice-skating rink. You feel better there, twinkle toes? I like skating and it helps me think, Artie. I have nothing but faith. Nothing but faith. For crying out loud. Who designed this? Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla and M. C. Escher. What are you doing here? Thought you might need me. Do you? Please. It's no big deal. I'm just trying to track down an electrical short or an anomaly. I tracked it down. I'll take that as a yes. I don't care if you're James Bond. What a therapist discusses with his patients is completely privileged. Not under the Patriot Act. I have no intention... Uh-huh? (CLEARS THROAT) Look, Ellis, people are being hurt. Believe me, you want to help me, or you're not gonna have any patients left. What's this? Don't touch that. Please. I just acquired it. Really? No, don't pick it up! It's an antique. Belonged to Joseph Dunninger, the famous mentalist. Are you kidding me, man? What, you didn't think that this was worth mentioning? I collect pocket watches. There's nothing in the Patriot Act about that, is there? I have to take this with me. You what? Don't snap your pencil. I'll get it back to you. Probably. Sheriff MacKenna was just here and I told him the same thing. Sister Grace has never been to see Ellis Hayes. Well, how can you be sure? Because I suggested it and she refused. She was mortified by the idea. I happen to believe in therapy. I suggested it to Meg as well. Anger issues? When Ben died, she felt betrayed by doctors, by God. It's quite common for... I know how she feels. Since I lost Sam, men in my life drive me... Even before my dad... Yes, well, to get back to Meg, I suppose she's been more angry with... Men. Angry at men. Agent Bering? My boss, my colleagues, my partner, my father, they're everywhere. Suffocating me. Agent Bering. Are you all right? Myka? Well, thank you so much. I'll just show myself out. MAC: Ellis just called me. He's very upset. Now, I want to know just what the hell you two are up to. I got people to protect in this town. You think you can just walk all over me? Dude, you're taking this kind of personal, don't you think? Secret Service. Anybody could buy a badge on the Internet. I don't know what you two got planned, but I will do whatever I have to to protect my country. Chew on that. Oh, hey, and where have you been? I was... I have been here for half an hour. And the sheriff is a little spooky, FYI, but don't worry, because I found it. (LAUGHS) Ta-da. Joseph Dunninger's watch. He's a famous mentalist, in case you didn't know, so score one for the Pete dog. (EXCLAIMS) Don't worry. You're still in charge. I mean, look, we can't all be heroes all the time. Your chance to be a hero... You're an ass. Huh? Hey! Ow! Myka, jeez Louise! Okay, little girl, fun's over! Myka, I think you got it. You're infected. MYKA: Thanks for bailing me out, but this is ridiculous. I've been exposed to the artifact. I should stay locked up. What am I supposed to do? Let you sit in jail and quietly slip into a coma? I could get really dangerous, Pete, to you! You know, I'm going back inside. Wait, wait, wait. Myka, look. No, you look. You have a job to do. You... How can you trust me if you know that I could turn on you at any minute? Because I do, okay? I just do. You're gonna have to do more than take a swing at me. Besides, how are you gonna be in charge if you're in jail, huh? Who's gonna tell me what to do? (FARNSWORTH RINGING) Hey, Artie. Artie, I've got it. I've been exposed. Are you sure? Oh, yeah, we're sure. (SIGHS) Okay, well, it's just that much more important to find this artifact fast. Hey, Artie, look, so there's no way it could be the watch, right? I mean, maybe, you know, the anti-magnetic bag thing didn't work. It is not the watch. Myka didn't touch the watch. And Sister Grace wasn't even a patient. I told him it wasn't the watch. I told you it wasn't the watch. That's not annoying at all. Look, guys, you're doing great, you just have to both go out there and keep looking. Artie, I've been exposed. I have to stay locked up. Yeah, I told her I could handle it. Please, like you handled the bar? I mean, come on. I mean, really? Hey, hey, hey, hey! Get it together. People are in hospitals. It's only a question of time before somebody dies from this thing that you have not found yet. All right. Okay. (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) You know, he's trying to find the location of this warehouse by probing the electrical grid. Look at that. Not a bad notion. This guy's a thinker. And what, we're just sitting ducks? No, no, no. Look at that. It's completely unfocused. He's got no actual control of anything. He's just causing trouble. Well, he seems to be doing a good job of that. Yeah. PETE: Okay, so maybe there's something going on before it affects you. What if... Pete, I insist that you handcuff me, make sure that I can't hurt you. Look, Myka, let's find the artifact by... I need you to disarm the danger first... I just don't understand why... I mean, that's what you're supposed to... Just listen to me for once. Uh-oh! No, you don't. Okay. All right, all right. Sorry about that. No, no, no, no, no. No worries. It's my fault. I kind of did that on purpose. I mean, what were you thinking just then? What were you feeling? Nothing. Okay, I was kind of thinking that you're an infantile chimp. I'm sorry. No, no, okay. That's good. So obviously it affects your subconscious. Subconscious. Subconscious desires. Pete, that's it. Meg wants revenge. Sister Grace wants to escape. Ross... I bet that Ross's wife is still breastfeeding, and Tommy secretly hates the violin. And you subconsciously want to punch me every five minutes. Okay, sometimes, but why me and not you, and why hasn't the whole town gone nuts? Okay, well, let's just retrace our steps. Where have you gone that I haven't? Okay, we were at the coffee shop. Coffee shop. And at the bar. I was at the jail, but nobody else there was affected, so I don't... (CHURCH BELL RINGING) Myka. That's Ross. MYKA: That's Meg. You've been in that church. Twice. You? No. (DOOR OPENING) Father, it's in the church. What's in the church? Tommy Wilson, Meg, Dave, Ross, they're all members of your congregation, right? What do they have in common? Are they on some committee together? No, they're not even... Wait, I've seen each of them recently. They've each been in here. Wait, wait, here, here in this office? Here. It's in here. Of course it is. I've been in here, too. Pete, you should get out of here. You have to get out of here now. Can't be that simple. Why? Father Braid isn't affected. Father, where do you talk to them? Where are you sitting? In that chair. And I sat... That's it. It's the chair. Father, where did you get this chair? I inherited it from my great, great, great... Got it. Pete... I'm on it. Okay, how long have you had the chair? About a week or so. What is that thing? (STUTTERS) It's a... It could... We... Never mind. Pete? Father, Father, what's his name, the original owner, your great, great, great... James Braid. He was a doctor. Did he... Wait. Did he say James Braid? Yes. Yes. He's the father of hypnotherapy. Artie, that's it. Father Braid has his chair. That's gotta be it, right? Hang on, hang on. He's a direct descendent. And if he's got the same DNA, same vocal patterns... It's the iron springs. It's the springs in the chair? If they become ferromagnetized, like silverware can... Screwdrivers. ...years of powerful hypnotherapy and brainwaves... All those patients sat in this chair, and those springs began to work on their own. Releasing their subconscious desires. Combined with the sound of his voice. Like a tuning fork. Are you saying this chair caused all this? I know. It's freaky. This stuff is always freaky. Artie, how do we reverse this? You know, you could try dousing the chair. That... (PEOPLE CLAMORING) Pete! Myka, what's going on? Hey, answer me! Pete! (SCREAMING) WOMAN: Mac! MAN 1: All the way out. MAN 2: Wait! Mac! There you are. Just who I was looking for. Sheriff, put the gun down. It's a virus. You planted a virus in my town, and I've gotta contain it! (GROANING) Okay, okay. Father, are you hit anywhere else? It's in my shoulder. It hurts. So I take it Sheriff MacKenna sat in that chair recently. Yesterday. Great. Let me help you. Let me see that. Ross, where are Susan and the twins? No, it's okay. They're outside. MYKA: The canister of goo is in the trunk. Let me see. Let me see. I'll take care of the Father. MAC: I'm going to clean up this town. You understand me? (PEOPLE GASPING) Get him outside right now. And get everyone as far away from here as possible. Okay. Come on. MAC: Do you hear me? I'm gonna clean up this town! Do you think the Tesla would ignite that bomb? Let's test that theory another day, shall we? Then go douse the chair. I'll take care of Captain America. No, no, he hates you. You go douse the chair. For once, would you just let me call it? It'd be better if you weren't here, Pete. Why do you always have to be so bossy? (GROANS) I'm sorry! Would you stop doing that? Just stop pissing me off then! PETE: All right, no, you know what? Fine, fine. MAC: Come on out and I'll let these people go. Down! Ow! Sorry. Sorry. Okay, you know, if you were gonna ask me how I would die, I would say that being beaten to death by my partner would be really low on the list. Just go do the chair. I'm gonna go do the chair. Okay. MAC: Stay down! Stay down! Don't do this, Mac! Try and focus. This isn't you. Some must die so others will live! You don't want to hurt these people, Mac. I know what you're feeling. Just try and fight it. I will not let this evil spread to the rest of the country! It ends here! There is no danger, Mac. Listen to me. Look around you. You know these people, right? They're your friends. Hey, I doused the chair. It's over! (GRUNTS) Okay, I'll be right back. MAC: It's a trick! You're trying to trick me! MYKA: It's not a trick, Mac. I'm on your side. See, Mac, I'm trying to help you. If you want me to trust you, then show yourself. Show yourself! (PANTING) Take me, Mac. I'm the one you want. Not them. There's probably dozens of you in town by now. Hundreds. No, it's just me. I'm the bad guy, Mac. All right? Let them go. You and your friends are dead. Mac? You lose this one. No! (TICKING) They never should have sent a woman. No, you did not. (GRUNTING) Pete, any time now. (SCREAMING) (PANTING) (TICKING) Agent Bering. What the... There's no time. Just help me get this thing off. Can you disarm it? No. Is he still... No, but this thing is still ticking! Pete? Pete? Pete! What? What? Oh, God. See, wasn't so hard, was it? No. No, it wasn't hard.

That GPS system, that's just fantastic. Fantastic. Yeah, and the seats? I think that leather was custom-made. Right? It was like Corinthian leather. What happened to my car? Did you... Did you ding it? No. Ding? No. Absolutely not. I wouldn't say... Then what? Okay, look, I needed somewhere to throw the bomb. Someplace enclosed. Oh, God. We did manage to save your cassette. (WHIMPERING) I loved that car. Loved... Loved. (EXCLAIMS) Psych! That's what you get for lying to us! "Let Myka think that she's in charge. " Yeah. "Pete's touchy. Make him think that he's in charge." You know what I'm saying? What a burn. (BOTH LAUGHING) PETE: You like that? I've been working on it all... The eyes are a little... But it's the thing, it's the mouth. Well, well, well, look who's able to work on something together without arguing. (WIND BLOWING) (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) (BEEPING) Oh, my God. He's in.
