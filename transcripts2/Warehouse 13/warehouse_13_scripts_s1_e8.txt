 In order to be presented as a gift to the president. But it's not going to happen because you two Are going to intercept it at the Japanese embassy. - that wasn't what I meant. - no, I know what you meant. But you've got to pack. and you got to catch a plane. And it really doesn't matter, does it, What the real sword does? Because, remember, "snag it, bag it, and tag it?" Well, get snagging, bagging, and tagging. You're off to swap Masamune for an Artie Nielsen. - Arigato. - Bitte schön - What is that? - Get out. - Okay. - So many questions. It was never boring working with you people. Hmm. Back and forth. Back and forth. One day your government wants me, The next I'm a crackpot. Your own partner said to me, "never again." Even then I knew One day one of you would be back To place an order. Huh? Oh, it better be cash. American credit ain't what it used to be. What's that? Another gadget for me to tinker with? Wait. I did what you asked. Lots of eyes to make the switch here. I guess night's our only option. White house won't be any easier. I'd feel a lot more comfortable doing it Before it gets anywhere near the president. It's ridiculous that we don't know what we're protecting him from, but... Typical Artie. I mean, I understand grabbing the artifact Before it causes trouble. But he couldn't spare two seconds To warn us about what we're walking into? Look, I'm sure if it were really dangerous, Artie would've told us. transcript: yyets.net - sync: honeybunny corrections & 720p: aydin1954 - www.addic7ed.com Warehouse 13 S01 E08 Let's go. Uh, go--go--go back. Go back. Go back. What--what exactly happened there? You tell us, Artie, okay? Because the Japanese sure as hell don't know. They're testing for everything from dirty bombs to gas leaks. They won't let us in the room. They're holding us in the lobby. They're--they're treating us like suspects. Suspects? Why? did you have the decoy sword with you? No. but they're not even looking for the sword, Artie. They--they're not even sure whether or not it was taken. Okay, that makes no sense to me whatsoever. Either it's gone or it's not gone. You said you saw somebody leaving. Did he have it? I don't know, okay? 'cause I was about two seconds away from passing out. Yeah, wh--wh--what did this guy look like? Uh, not female. Look, Artie, uh, my Japanese sucks. But it sounds to me as if they think the sword Was vaporized or something. What do you mean vaporized? What do you mean? By the bomb? There was no bomb, Artie. Nothing blew up. There was no victims that were brought out Or--or dead bodies. There was nothing. I don't understand. Nothing blew up? That's the weird part. It was--it was like a bomb, only backwards, okay? Instead of blowing out, it--it--it yanked everything in. - Implosion. - Artie. Artie. Did the sword do this? And if it did, can I reconsider this mission? It didn't. And what you have to do is you have to get in that room And tell me exactly what you see. That's a look I don't know. It's called the past rearing its ugly head. So in other words, the sword didn't do whatever happened at the embassy. But you know what did. Oh, God, I hope not. - Artie, where are you going? - No, no, I can't-- First, I have to... - Hey. - Here we go. Round two with Mr. Congeniality. Mr. Ogawa, look, we've answered all your questions, And now we have a few for you. Actually, agent Bering, I have one more. Why does the secret service need to send two different units To inspect the same gift? Two different... I'm quite certain they will have the same question. On the Q.T. is one thing. But you're tramping through my backyard, Literally tripping over my agents, And you don't even give me a heads-up. We have explicit instructions not to contact you any more. Artie Nielsen. Look, it's not like we can't have coffee now and then. We just can't have you on speed dial. Look. I get it. For better or for worse-- and I happen to think worse-- You two are serving a new master. This isn't your screw-up. It was his. It's just that he doesn't really... Play well with others... - Hmm. - So much. So this security officer, Ogawa, Japanese embassy, Is waiting for my explanation of what you were doing And if you had anything to do with whatever the hell that was. Any suggestions what I'm supposed to tell him? All right. Do me one favor. Get on a plane and leave D.C. while I can still let you. Can I at least have that? Be out of here as soon as possible. I don't think this is what Dickinson had in mind. Well, what are we gonna do? We've got to get into that room. A room that's losing evidence as we speak. I know. It's just, I thought coming back to D.C. Would feel like old home week or something. - Home is overrated. - God. - Uncool, Artie. - What are you doing here? - Uncool, Artie. - What is he doing? I had a hunch about something From Pete's description and I just need to see this with my own eyes. You two have a plan to get in there? Yeah. We're gonna crawl under the motion sensors-- Yes. There's an access panel on the roof. We can go in through the-- well, please, ladies first. No. You know what, you--you be the smart one this time. Okay, get this, There's an access panel on the roof. It'll bring us in right above the main wiring For the security system. Now, if we crawl on our bellies, we can avoid the motion sensors. And what do you mean "this time"? All right. I get the idea. If I may, put these on. Really. Or you'll be of no use to me. Let's go. I look like Kermit the frog. Oh, God. Artie, stop doing that! Yeah, I gotta tell you, Myka, those really bring out your eyes. This is a, uh, 14th century Chinese firework Known as an ice flower. Very few-- very few like it left. Now... Do not tell Mrs. Frederic that I did this, all right? All right, we've got about ten minutes, more or less. Let's go. The light pattern triggers a feedback loop In the optic nerve that mesmerizes the viewer. They won't remember a thing. Booga-booga. Whoa, freaky McFreakerson. So it's some sort of reverse chemical reaction? Oh, yeah. Okay, take these off. Just don't look directly through the window. This was made by an implosion grenade. It removes matter from the center of a space And pulls everything-- Obviously everything-- Directly towards it with violent force. This explains why they couldn't find the sword. It could be in there. - Oh, no, no, no, no. No. the sword, long gone. Stolen. This was used by the thief as a cover. - So the guy that I saw-- - The guy you kind of saw? The guy that I saw leaving must've stolen the sword And hidden in this room over here When he set off the bomb. I collected these grenades years ago. Every last one of them. I know I did. So, wait, whoever stole the sword Has other things that belong in the warehouse-- Which would mean that we have competition. I don't know. Artie, just how long is this list of things We don't know? I don't know. About twice as long as the list of things That I don't know about, all right? Well, who else would have these implosion grenades, Artie, I mean, if you collected them all? Well, whoever it is, if he's willing to use this To cover his tracks, then it's somebody that's-- What's a darker word for dangerous? If he did this to steal the sword, He'd have no trouble killing anyone Who got in his way. Oh, none at all. Next time, don't get a suite--just a room. Okay. The lead here is the implosion grenade. We find out who had one of those And then we find out Who has the sword. Okay, let me just-- Is there a listing for implosion grenades? - Those were the days. - Artie, we've got WiFi. - No, no, no, I like paper. Actually, I hate paper. But, you know, it's a security issue. Okay, Artie, enough. You have to fill us in. Okay, if the competition used an implosion grenade to steal the sword, Then what the hell does this sword do? Yeah. I mean, it must be pretty major, right? You don't drop a nuclear bomb to steal a butter knife. Exactly. Okay. You want to know about the sword? I'll tell you about the sword. The Honjo Masamune is much, much more than a dull knife. It kept the ruling Shogunate in power for hundreds of years By making them invincible in battle. And the beauty in the way these things were forged. I mean, ritually hammered and folded. The blade millions of layers of steel With a carbon content that's right off the charts. And each layer only atoms--atoms--thick. I mean this sword... Is said to be perfectly aligned. - So what does it do? - Yeah. Um, ha, uh... Okay, you know how geese fly in a "v" formation And the wind hits the first bird and then splits And then it keeps on splitting wider and wider When it hits each successive bird 'cause it makes it easier for the birds to fly that way. - Good. So--so what... does the sword...do? The blade in this particular sword Is said to be so perfect that light splits in its path And goes around the person holding it. Um, are we--are we talking about, um, invisibility? Mm. Kind of. In effect. No, the person's still there. Although, you know, the light that we see Doesn't hit-- yes, invisibility. Awesome. I knew-- I knew that was possible. I knew it. Okay. Invisible swords now... Hey, Artie, these are-- these are the same sword, right? - Yeah. - They don't match. What? Well, you see, disc thing that's attached to the grip-- Well, it's in the painting, but it's not in the sword From the dig site. It's missing its tsuba. This piece right here is called a "tsuba." It's actually a collectible in its own right, You know, separate from the sword. But this is missing its tsuba. Then the sword might not even work. And if it doesn't, the guy's going to come looking for it. We are in a race. We're in a race. You two have to find what happened to that tsuba and fast. Well, Artie, we're looking for a 500-year-old sword. 800. Exactly. So it should be easy. You guys follow the tsuba. I will follow-- Ah...the implosion grenade. And one of us will find the thief. W--wait. I mean, wh--wh--where are you going? Somebody is making new grenades. Somebody who promised not to. Again he doesn't answer. And no good-bye. This is impossible. Keep at it though. you're the smart one. - What are you doing? - What? - What are you doing? - Nothing. You're--you're doing great. - Hello. - Leena, hey. Hey, is--is Claudia there? Okay, she won't be able to find it either. Claudia's out. It's just me. Oh, um, okay. Uh, well, you'll do. - Flattered. - Sorry. Listen, Leena, you know that 800-year-old sword That we were swapping out? Uh, well, it turns out, a piece of it has come up missing. So if--if--if you were standing next to Artie, right, And he was looking for this thing, Wh--what--what would he be doing? Artie did say that the sword was from the Edo period. So instead of trying to track it forward From the past, just find it in the present. Identify any collectors that deal in that period And then try and find as much information as you can On any sales or transactions of those pieces. - Right. Right. Right. Uh, since-- since you're right there, Do--do you think that, uh, maybe you could, uh... Give me a minute, Pete. One point, Lattimer. Thank you. Hello. Hello! Hello! Oh, you should've kept your promises, Erik. The tsuba, did you find it? - Well-- - Well, it wasn't easy. You know, it--it took some digging. But, uh, it turns out an antiques dealer Had it in Tokyo in the 1920s. Now it's here in Washington. Artie, it's at the secret service. What the hell's it doing there? Well, the Japanese government presented it In the 1920s to Woodrow Wilson as a symbol of peace. Guess that didn't work out so well. And the curator at the Wilson museum of peace Made the connection a couple days ago And offered it to be united with the sword At the gift ceremony. But freaky explosions tend to put the kibosh on ceremonies, So it's going back to the museum in the morning. The sword and the tsuba in D.C. at the same time. No, no, no. That's--that's too much coinc-- Too much coincidence. Well, Artie, we're sitting on the secret service building. But, look, if this thief is--is coming to get the tsuba, We have to warn Dickinson. No, no. absolutely not. Well, Artie, you saw what this guy's willing to do. Yeah, and--and so did you. And imagine what he's capable of with the sword. No, no, no. this thief is ruthless and smart. So if you warn the secret service, And they do anything out of the ordinary-- Anything at all-- then he will be tipped off. So you want to use him as bait. - No, Artie. No. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! This is not a discussion. When I-- - Hello, Artie. - Artie. - Artie. - James. Okay, I think I know who this is. And I've got to go. You tail the agents. Grab the tsuba. Watch out For implosion grenades. Good-bye. Your agents Bering and Lattimer Are compromised. Not possible. I ran a background check on Arthur Nielsen. Where'd you get this information? I have my sources same as you do. I don't see how any of this is your business. The three of them returned to the embassy last night. I'm very sorry to hear that. I have no desire to stir up an international incident. It's a great deal of paperwork and a great deal of scrutiny. And you and I both get screwed. If you can't handle this, I will be forced to take this to a higher authority. Everything all right? Yes. Peachy. What? The tsuba's heading back to the museum. We're heading out. Regards to President Wilson. Hi, it's me, Artie. No, I-I-I know. I know. Look, please, do you think you could meet me? As soon as possible. Artie does to us what he's making us do to them. He keeps us in the dark. For all we know, we're decoys too. Look, we're all pretty good at our jobs, okay? We accepted the risks going in. Having intel in the field keeps an agent alive, Pete. But Artie acts like keeping us alive Isn't a priority. To him, we're just-- red shirts? - Yeah. - Okay. First, he doesn't think we're red shirts. And second, that's so cool you knew what I meant. Come on. He's got a Tesla too. Drop that weapon! Are you okay? Yeah. Grab the tsuba. Ah. You get a look? - We get it? - We got it. Yes. Now give it back. Slowly. No. no, no, no. Did--did you see that--that guy With the--with that--that gun? It--it erases your short-term--no. Psst. What the hell is up with you two? Now who are you working for? Secret service. But a department that you, sir, know nothing about. I doubt that. Now what department? It's a, um, archival department. You're filing clerks Running around shooting stun guns At your own people? Oh, we didn't shoot you. All right, filing clerks that protect us from invisible bad guys. - Yeah. Pretty much. - Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much. I'll take it from here. Careful, archives. Paper cuts, they take days to heal. That's hilar-- you're hilarious. Very scared. - So glad to see you. - Thank you. Not a damn word. Now, I warned you to back off before things got worse. Do you have any idea what this looks like? Come on. You know we didn't shoot at them. - You know that we're legit. - Yeah, I do. But if you keep shutting me out, How am I supposed to back you up? We'll just-- This stays with me until things die down. - Or implode. - What? Sir, you're putting yourself in serious danger. You have no idea what you're dealing with. So tell me. We can't. Well, I admire your loyalty. I prized it myself once. But you need to look at where you're placing it right now. This has come to my attention. It checks out. And I will have to act on it. You want me to trust you, okay. If there's even a remnant of a two-way street left-- If you still trust that I'm trying To look out for you--then read it. I want some extra people in the office. Around the clock for the next 72. Just in case. Why? 'cause he stole something dangerous And it's important that I get it back from him. What makes you so sure it was him? Call it a gut feeling. Oh, that's still annoying, you know. What is? You talking in riddles and intuition. You never change. Yeah. So has he? You know, contacted you? I haven't seen or heard from James in 15 years. And, uh, the irony's not lost on me That you're the one who's asking. Carol. Carol. Look at me. No matter what you think, I'm not the one who drove him away. You made things intolerable for all of us. Well, if it--if it makes you comfortable to blame me, Then you should go ahead and blame me. I don't care. But the truth is that you made choices. And the choices you made--you chose badly. I'm not the one who disappeared. Oh, there it is. How did I not know? What? What--not know what? Oh, stop it, Artie. You're in town for whatever reason and you decide to twist the knife For old time's sake. Rub it in that I chose the wrong guy. Right. You're not the one who disappeared. You would've had to have been there in the first place. No, not Artie. Oh, all your--all your secrets, And your--and your treasure hunts, And that damned place. You know, James believed in life. You need to get one. Hold on. Hold on. Carol. Carol. Carol. Could you please--please. Wait. Wait. Wait. - What? - Listen. Listen. Listen. Carol, if you're harboring him in any way, You're in danger. What are you doing here? Just about to ask you the same thing. Why are you bothering that poor woman and torturing yourself? It is called investigating a case. This isn't the case. This is self-pity. The case is the implosion grenade And the sword. And someone out there is running around Using the artifacts-- but that someone--that someone is Macpherson. And I can prove it. Remember? Artie, we've both seen you like this before. No, no, no, no. He planted this on purpose. He wanted me to find it. Otherwise he would've been much too careful. He's taunting me. Would you listen to yourself? You are leaping to wild conclusions Based on nothing. And meanwhile, your team is falling apart around you. Oh, they're not falling apart. Myka and Pete are fine. Are they? Did you know the tsuba's now under Dickinson's control? Did you know Bering and Lattimer had been detained? They're at the hotel. I'm taking you all off this case. - Wait. Wait. Wait. Wh--what if I'm right? What if it is Macpherson? Go home, Artie. - Artie, where are you? - It doesn't matter. New orders. You two stay in the hotel and you wait for me. I will take it from here. What's the matter? What's wrong? You okay? - Yeah. Everything's fine. - All right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause it isn't true. That isn't Artie. I don't want to believe it either, Pete, But it's true. Yeah, well, you shouldn't even be reading that. Pete. We should be out doing something. Pete, his real name isn't even Artie Nielsen. It's Artie Weisfelt. He used to work for the NSA. He was a cryptographer--a code breaker-- When he was in his 20s. They recruited him right out of school. They had him decoding soviet communications. He intercepted letters, phone transcripts. Then they think he turned. He contacted one of the people they were spying on And he started selling secrets to the Russians. And his file, it just ends. He was never prosecuted. It's like he just disappeared. But it's him, Pete. What? It's definitely him. You're under arrest. No, no, no. listen to me. I have to take this. Lives are in danger--no, no, not for that. Dr. Weisfeld, you're under arrest for treason. Just tell us that the charges aren't true. We both know. So just tell us. - I can't. They're true. - Okay, that's--that's not-- I had my reasons. Artie, homeland security's coming To pick you up. You need to give us a way to help you now. You need to concentrate on the mission, Not worry so much about me. Mrs. Frederic fixed this once and she can fix it a-- This whole thing could've been avoided If you just told us anything about the sword, the tsuba, your past. Anything, Artie, we--we--we could have helped. We could have run interference with Dickinson. If you just trusted us. So--so what happens now, Artie? I mean, what--what happens with the warehouse? I mean, what, are we in charge? what? I think we should know. She fixed all this. Mrs. Frederic. She fixed all of this years ago. It's him too. It--it has to be. Okay, Artie, This isn't just about the treason, all right? You also burglarized the secret service. I'll spend a little time in prison. You're not getting what is important here. I'm not getting what's important. And the fact that I changed my name-- Which, by the way, I did so the soviets wouldn't find me, Not to hide from our government. Important. That--Mrs. Frederic fixed all this. She expunged all the charges. Someone obviously unfixed it. - Artie, focus. - Oh, I'm focused. Here's the key. Who gave Dickinson my file? Find out, that'll take you directly to who has the sword. And that will lead you to Macpherson. Who? Time's up. Some friendly advice, it's self-preservation time. Put in for transfers while this whole warehouse business Is still just a sidetrack in your careers. Scars don't have to be permanent. - Yeah. No can do. - Just think about it. Meantime, I have some self-preservation to do too. Now, I may not be your boss anymore, But until someone tells me otherwise, I still outrank you. So this time I am putting you on a plane With your best friends as an escort. - Why is he here? - Ogawa? That guy makes me itch. Well, the Japanese want their tsuba back. With the sword gone, it's all that's left of a national treasure. Don't worry. They're leaving tonight for Japan. By tomorrow, the tsuba will be on the other side of the planet. By the way, just to ask it, who did give you that file on Artie? That's my secret to keep. Cooper, see that they get on their plane. No detours. Yeah, and--and don't rule out shooting them if necessary. What's going on? What? It's Ogawa. it was him at the embassy. He walked out with the sword. - Are you sure? - Myka, I saw him. You have to trust me. Dickinson looked at him when I asked him about the file. Artie was right. Yeah, and now he's got the sword and the tsuba. Heading for the diplomatic terminal. There's no security. How about you both just take a time-out, huh? Just for the drive to Dulles. Let's go. Bored? Yeah. Oh, finally. Hi. Who's Mrs. Frederic? I'd tell you, but then he'd have to kill you. What do you think? 6th to constitution? This time of day I'd take 9th. Yeah, you're right. Want to grab a beer after we drop off these two jokers? Ah, I can't. in-laws are in town. Hey, hey, hang on. I want to pull over And grab a paper. They'll be fine. Before you say anything, I know that I mangled this. I know I ran in there impulsively Without--without thinking--without my bag-- Because I had a bigger--someone dug you up. Oh. So you know. It's Macpherson. I'm right. Yes, I'm afraid you are. Now it's up to you to stop him. Thank you. Don't move! So, Mr. Ogawa, when does he get here? Oh, God. It works. - Hello, Arthur. - James. Good to see you after all these years. Wish I could say the same. Not while you're pointing a gun at me or trying to. Well, no, you're an invisible guy with a sword. I think you might have the advantage over me. My point exactly. So what happened to you, James? What happened? I mean, I know we had our differences And I know Carol... happened. You always had your own ideas, Your own objections to warehouse policy. But, I mean, James, James--killing people. When did you turn into that? I woke up, Arthur. Ah. Once I was out from under Mrs. Frederic's iron hand And your neuroses, I could see the world more clearly. Yeah, well, you know, that's a little pathetic, Isn't it, James, blaming everybody else but yourself? I don't think you found clarity. I don't think your ego could stand the light. I'd love to discuss this with you at length. You or one of your new agents. Lattimer and Bering, right? I've been observing them for some time. I see they have potential, but they're so raw, So untrained, so corruptible. If you come anywhere near them, I promise you-- I promise you, James, that you're going to regret it. You'll never get anywhere close to them as long as I'm alive! Arthur, you can still read my mind. - Ah! Ah. Ah. Ah. You always hurt the one you love. Artie? No! No! No! - Artie. - Yeah. Oh, my God. okay, we have to get you to a hospital. Wh--what did you do to yourself? Well, it was the only way I knew how to get the sword. What if we didn't get here in time? Yeah, I thought you would. So just--right now, could you just hurry up, Pull it out? Wait. Wait. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Wait a minute. Now wait a minute. Are you sure? Yeah, it's the sharpest sword ever made. It should slide out just like butter. Just--just do it really, really, really, really fast. Okay! Not like butter! You all right? - Is that one of those... - Yeah. I wasn't here when everything went down Between Artie and MacPherson, but I know it was bad. Here. Yeah, this feels right. Yeah. It must've been bad. I mean, all that stuff with Ogawa. Giving Dickinson the file. He wanted more than the sword. He wanted to mess us up as a team. It worked. Well, I don't know how to work with him right now. The thing about Artie is that he's lost A lot of people in his life--including agents. So now he just shuts everybody out. It's a defense mechanism. That's not an excuse. It's not a reason to keep secrets as compulsively as he does. It's not meant to be an excuse. Just an explanation. Artie acts like he doesn't care, But he does--about you both--a lot. And that scares him. Well, I guess he needs to work that out, doesn't he? You know, just because he lost people, It doesn't make us expendable. I'm not a red shirt. I'm not. She's upset because I don't communicate. Did she not notice the word "secret" in her job description? Their job is to follow instructions. So is yours. You knew that I couldn't let this go. as it turns out, I was right. I apologize for doubting you. Oh. Well, thank--thank-- we're--we're all human. As far as I know. You know that this was only Macpherson's first move. And he's planning something... bigger. Any guesses what his plan might be? No. I don't know. I don't want to wait to find out. You know what the Talmud says? "If someone's coming to kill you, get up early, kill them first." It also says "don't rush into any unnecessary danger. A miracle may not save you." transcript: yyets.net - sync: honeybunny corrections & 720p: aydin1954 - www.addic7ed.com Warehouse 13 S01 E08
