 Previously on Warehouse 13... Whoever stole the sword has other things that belong in the warehouse, which would mean that we have competition. Lattimer and Bering, right? They're so raw, so untrained, so corruptible. What about your folks? Colorado Springs. They own a bookstore called Bering & Sons. Well, he must be proud of you. You ever see that movie, the great Santini,

 with the tough dad and the scared kids? It's like that, huh? Yeah, except it wasn't over in two hours. Oh, my. - Myka? - Artie, I'm here. In Macpherson's apartment. Myka, be careful. Macpherson's gone. It's another dead end. Found him! Pete's having better luck in Montreal. How much better? Macpherson's headed east on Sainte Catherine! Artie, I've got the cops on me! I'll get rid of the cops. You just stay on Macpherson.

 There's an alley on the right. He's heading for the subway. Attention all units. Abandon the current pursuit on Sainte Catherine! This is an RCMP matter! Repeat: This is an RCMP matter! We got him, Artie! Be careful, Pete. We do not know if he has them. Artie. Give it up, Macpherson. We win this one. Artie, he has the cymbal. He has the cymbal! Pete, you've gotta get out of there! Just get out of there! If you see the cymbals, cover your ea-- Pete? Artie? What happened? Is everything okay? Pete! Pete, can you hear me? Pete! Pete. Look, Pete. Pete, you've got to get up. Mom, I'm up. I won't be late. I'm okay. I managed to cover my ears. Where is he? Where's Macpherson? He's gone, Artie. I lost him. I lost Macpherson. Hey, Mom, listen, I'm busy right now. I can't really-- Myka, it's your father. He--he--he started feeling bad, and I-I--he--he-- What? Just come on home. Just come back. Just come home. We've got to wrap it up. Artie, I need to go home.

Does Tamara know you're stalking her? Or is this just for makeup tips? Give it back, Greg. Boo-hoo, baby. Yeah, I don't know, Leena. It's complicated. Macpherson put decoys and bogus informational breadcrumbs-- Put them all over the world, and my software narrowed him down to two locations, and Montréal turned out to be, you know, the one that was-- Did you say you wanted no ice in your le-- God! Don't do that! Mrs. Frederic, what'd you do with Leena? Sorry. Would--would you care for a le--le--no. You're here because you want to know what happened. Two policemen dead, Arthur. I know what happened. The Montreal police have a dashboard camera in the car. But I told Pete. He had the recording. How did you--? Please. Look, we were following a lead. You took a shot in the dark. We hit the center of that target. With a small-caliber bullet. Pete's caliber is very large. We-- You know what? I'm done with this analogy. We had an agreement. You were supposed to gather information... I know. Bring it to me... Yeah. And we would plan to get Macpherson together. You had no offensive strategy. No defensive posture. No containment plan. You were not prepared. Where's Lattimer and Bering? Out. Manage my assets better or I swear on the ashes of the first 12 warehouses, I will take them away. I can get Macpherson again. I don't doubt it. You make no moves against him without consulting me first. Yes, ma'am. Do you have-- How does she do that? All right, everyone. Please close your booklets, ladies and gentlemen. Tamara, can you gather them up, please? Okey-doke. John Steinbeck's east of Eden. Betrayal, lost love, jealousy. Good stuff. Please read the first 50 pages for discussion tomorrow, if you would. Have a good one. Bobby, can you come here for a sec? You okay? Uh, you seem a little distracted. Computer lab thing. Up late. Did you, uh-- Did you talk to her yet? I've got something for you. Thanks, Tamara. No problem. Poetry. Burns, Blake, Byron. That's just the Bs. Let them do the talking for you, hmm? Good luck. Mom. Mom? Mom. Oh, Myka! Hi, hi! Your cell phone isn't working, and I tried calling, but-- the battery died. Where is he? He's fine. Don't worry. He's upstairs. Why don't you go up and see him? Sorry I scared you, but he's fine now. - Hey. - Hey. Yep. A wasted trip, kiddo. You bring a gun in here? Yeah, it's packed downstairs, disassembled. I thought you were in the hospital. I thought you were dying. Your mother overreacted. I'm fine. - It's not a stroke? - No, no, no, not a stroke. We've got a few more tests, but, oh, God, you should have heard him screaming. I didn't scream. Oh. I've never screamed in my life! Do you remember what happened? No, I don't remember anything, except waking up in the ambulance, wondering what the fuss was all about. Jeannie, get the girl some food. Mom, I'm--I'm not hungry. It's because you've starved your hunger nerve to death. Uh, the doctor said it might be a virus. You're too skinny. Um, an inner ear or spinal inflammation. Um, they've got him on steroids and an anti-viral. - Oh, Mrs. B. - Oh, hi. I am gonna need this recipe. The hot sauce is killer. Great. Oh, you've got some-- Look at you. Oh, sorry. What are you--? Oh, we've met Pete. Boy, he's a pip. Just got here. Met your dad. Are these yours? Found them in the kitchen. Yeah. I'm so sorry. They're, uh, for collecting evidence. I'm sorry. What are you doing here? Well, I thought you might need the support. Artie disagreed but was overruled. By who? By me. The pip. Well, I don't need any support. Miss independent, me neither. Seriously, Dad. I've been here for, like, what? A minute? Miss touchy, too. Oh, please, Warren. I've got to go down to the basement. Eat something! I'm not hungry. Well, um, I'm going to get that guest room ready. And for your bed, I've got some new flannel sheets I got at Dody's. No, no, no. You are my guests. It's my house. You're my guests. Wow. What about work? Uh, well, work vanished. And until it reappears, I'm here as a friend in this hopefully not too stressful time. I mean, it could have been worse, right? Your dad? Thank you. No, I-I appreciate it, and you're right. It could have been worse. Well, hey, wait, wait. Myka, Myka, Myka. Yeah? Look, I was talking to your dad. He thinks you're still in D.C. They both do. Well, yeah. And if you tell them any differently, I swear, I will--I will drop a dictionary on your crotch. What? I'm supposed to tell them that I'm working for the world's most dangerous antiques roadshow? No. You tell them the truth. Or at least part of the truth. I don't know. Something to cut the stress. I'm not stressed. You're lying to them. It's a force of habit, you know? It keeps my dad from being disappointed. You have hot sauce all over your face. Dad! Mom? Myka, get back. Dad? Watch your eyes. Oh! Warren. Warren. What happened? What happened is... Your dad's got an artifact. Myka! Myka! Hey! Where's the notebook? It's this way. Myka? Mom, it's okay. Myka, who is it? Is she-- This is Claudia. We work with her. What's that? That is-- Claudia, back here. That's for me. No, you wait just a minute. I want some answers, Myka. Now, first of all, who is the man in the little TV? His name is Artie. And is he a doctor? No, but-- Your father belongs in a hospital. This isn't medical. Mom, this is something else. And how do you know? You're not a doctor. You protect the president. Not anymore. I'm still with the government, but I am doing this now. What? What are you doing? I'm trying to help Dad, Mom, so just let me do that. Trust me. Please. Ready? Yeah. Um, Mom, just stay here. Whatever you see or hear, just stay put. But-- just don't move. Do-- It'll be okay. They do this kind of stuff all the time, so-- Claudia? I gotta-- But what's going on? They're really good at this. Here it is. Kill it. Duck and cover. What's happening? Mom, how's Dad? Um, he's the same. Why, was something supposed to happen? Check his arms. It's still there. It's ink. Ink. Take it out. Now what? The neutralizer failed because I think we're dealing with a bifurcated object. It's--it's got at least two parts, and they're each dependent on the other. And, uh, that notebook is just one half of the package. So what's the other half? You know, based on the manifestations of the ink, then that would tell me that it's a pen, most like--well, a pen, anyway. Oh, by the way, the shipper's address? That's completely phony. Macpherson sent it, didn't he? I don't know that. So what? He's coming after family now? What does he want? Well, he wants to hurt us, because we're going after him. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Just stop it. We don't know who sent it or why. If it is Macpherson, it could be revenge or mischief or a diversion so that we're doing this while he's doing something else. Just in case, just to be safe, I've, uh-- I'm circling the wagons around Joshua and around Pete's family. Who or why does not matter. What matters is your father and the notebook. Now--now, listen. I've analyzed the text. It ain't good. It's Poe. Um, Edgar Allan Poe. The reason that the book is getting under your father's skin is because the pen is not with it. So, what? We bring the pen together with the notebook And this all stops? Yeah. Well, probably, if it follows a typical bifurcated artifact scenario. It can't be an accident that this book found its way to your dad. Look, uh, Myka, right now your father is a conduit. The notebook, the pen, they're linked through his energy, through his love of the written word. So where is this pen? Well, I'm searching for coinciding incidents right now. Uh, you know, I've got the filters off. But it's causing trouble somewhere? But I'll find it. You'll get it. The next time he has an attack, I'll trace the pen. You'll retrieve it and reunite it with the notebook. How long does he have? I don't know what you-- How long--what? How long does he have? Artie, my father can't take this much longer. Um... A day. Maybe two. But you can help him. Until I land on something, Myka, just surround him with his books, with his world, and read to him, Myka, read to him books that he loves and use those words to fight what's happening to him. And just try to keep him connected to reality if you can. Bobby's not that bad. Look, all I'm saying is, watch out. Geek love. Ugh! "I might have been improved for my whole life. "I might have been made another creature, perhaps, For life, by a kind word, at that season..." Do you want me to take over? No, no. I'm--I'm fine. He's gonna be okay, mom. Um... Oh. I'll be back in a sec. I'm just gonna take these dishes. Freak's probably swiped your panties from gym class or something. Gross! Tiger. Dad? Tiger, stop it. Fire. Dad? Fire! Dad? Help, somebody get some help. Artie's got something. What? At the precise moment your dad was shouting "Fire," a kid in Portland, Oregon, was burned by some bizarre wall of flame shooting from his locker. No one can explain it. Well, what about the tiger thing? Kid's a football star for the Kingford Tigers. - Let's go. - Wait, Myka. I need you to stay here. I have to help my dad, Pete. I know, but we've got two artifacts. He's connected to one. I need you to stay on the notebook. I'll take care of the pen. Myka, look at me. No one can help your dad right now more than you can. I can't let you go alone. I'll take Claudia. Keep her safe. Yeah. But there's something else. What? I think I'm hot for your mom. I'll break it to dad. Okay. I needed to speak with you, Bobby. Is, uh-- is everything okay? The poetry inspiring you? Not so much. You know, it seems we had a little burglary here the other day. The story is that it was one of the pens that Edgar Allan Poe used. Oh, he used it. Don't look at me like that. I noticed that you were fascinated with the pen. Are you saying I took it? Are you saying I took it? I'll tell you what. I'm gonna go to the lounge for a soda, and if the pen should show up while I'm gone, well, we'll just chalk it up to something strange and mysterious. Back in a bit. - Mr. Ives. - Mr. Ives. Here. "Wall"? "Wall"? "Wall" what? You. Really? Does he like horror novels? Stephen King, Lovecraft, Poe? You're assuming the boy reads. No, he's just a bully. Look, I mean, how big a deal is this? I mean, this school's got a reputation to maintain, and if it gets out that the government's investigating a teenage prank, it'll put a lot of parents off. You mean donors? Why do you think it's just a prank? Well, we're not schooling little terrorists here. Somebody in the science class got tired of Parmut picking on him and gave him a hotfoot. Oh, yeah? How's he doing? He's fine. Uh, you want this open? No. We'll, uh, we'll take it from here. You'll want to step back, please. Why? It's not dangerous. Please. Thank you. Okay. You ready? Why not? Okay, we're in business. Here we go. So, uh, you had any other incidents? With what, fire? Well, anything strange. Say a tell-tale heart, perhaps? What? There you go. Gotta love Artie. What's that? You don't happen to have Edgar Allan Poe's pen lying around, would you? Well, actually-- yes? Mr. Ives' classroom. He likes to collect items from famous people. The pen is here, then. Well, it was. Um, it got stolen. This last one was the worst. I know. Dad? If you'd been a boy, I'd have called you Sue. What? Johnny Cash. It's a song. A boy named Sue. Okay. Make you tough. Well, I'm sorry I wasn't a boy. I'm sorry I wasn't a father. He has regrets. About me? Yes. About his life. What do you mean? He wanted to write books. I know. I know that he wanted to write books. Did you know he wrote a novel? No. 12 times. Over and over again. Unpublished. He loved it too much to let it go. He was afraid. Where is it? A long time ago, when he finally gave up... he told me to burn it. He hasn't written a thing since. It can't be. Mr. Ives? Hello? Nice place for a pen, soaking up all that Poe juice. Huh. Do you know that ravens are actually brilliant? They've adapted to humans like rats and cockroaches. They've figured out how to figure us out. - Shh. - What? Shh. Hear anything? Just the beating of my hideous-- - Stop it. - Okay. Listen. What is that? A rat in the wall? Short story. Guy walled up. The cask... of amontillado. Here, take if off there. I don't-- I don't want avian flu! Take it! - All right! - What do I--uhh! Mr. Ives? Who did this to you? Bobby. Find him. Stop him. Bobby, not cool. Myka, something's wrong. Artie, I need help. What's this? A poem. I wrote it for you. I gotta go. We're losing him. Myka, just read to him. Read it. I have read. I've read him everything, okay? It's not working. You have to find the words that he loves. You have to find a book that means more to him than--than anything in the world. Mom, tell me you didn't burn it. - What? - Dad's book. Aunt Cindy's bureau. The bottom drawer. Okay, So Ives said that-- That Bobby had a crush on what--what's her name? - Tamara. - Tamara, right. There's always a girl. Don't blame her. Blame testosterone. Crazy, crazy man hormone. I'm not blaming the girl. I'm blaming Poe. Bobby? Crazy, scary man hormone. Check out Miss Teenage Zombie. Oh, right. Uh... Bobby... and... Tamara. Tamara, was it? Right? That's a nice pen, Bobby. Why don't you give it up, huh? Come on, give it here. "Pendulum"? You've gotta be kidding me. Bobby! I got it. Bobby, you've got to stop this. I know, you're all full of Poe, up to your creepy eyeballs in "Nevermore" and crap, but-- but--but... But this isn't fiction! It's real! It's the most real I have ever felt in my entire life. The blue willow sky by Warren Bering. Chapter one. "When the girl was born, his first thought was fear." It's beautiful. Bobby, you're a good person, but you're-- You're hurting people! You're hurting yourself and you're hurting Tamara, and it has to stop! People like you don't see me. You don't believe in me. People like you need to be shocked into seeing. You need to be horrified. Then you'll understand. Understand what, Bobby? Tell me what! That words have power. "...for her. For his daughter. She was his life." But this isn't fiction! It's real! "She was his life. His only job now was keeping her safe." "She was his life." It's working, Myka. Words have power. Something's happening. Go, go, Claudia! Get the pen! Who are you? What? One second. Nice, Claud. Here's the bag. Get him to a hospital. This still has a hold on him! And Micah's dad. Myka! I got it. Hey. Hey. How is he? - Is that it? - That's it. Well, he--he's not worse, but he's not better. Not--not completely. His strength is the only thing that's keeping that pen from flipping completely out. Okay, the notebook's in place. Good. Take the pen, keep it in the bag, and just, you know, approach the notebook. I'm on it. Be careful! I am! Would you stop yelling at me? Somebody turn down his volume or something. Okay. Now what? You know, put the bag right over the notebook, turn it upside down, dump the pen out, make sure it lands on the notebook and stays there. That's it? Just dump it out? Yeah. Just lay it on the notebook? Yeah. This isn't Cirque du Soleil! Just dump the pen on the book and stand back! All right! Artie, nothing's happening. Uh, that's--that's okay. It's all right, it's fine. It's been a while since they've been together. Probably they're just getting reacquainted. Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad? What's this? Hi. What, did I doze off? Um, sort of. I was dreaming you were reading and... You didn't burn it? No. I-I did. Okay, well, um, I think I've got everything. - Honey? - Yeah. Hey, I don't know what it is you do for a living, but you do it very well, and I mean that. I'll see you soon, and we'll--we'll talk. We'll talk about something other than books. Oh, Mom. Good-bye, honey. Thank you so much. And, um, you take care of Pete. I always do. - Hello. - Hello. - Got everything? - Yeah. Called the cab? N-- - No, no. No, I didn't. - Oh. I think, Mr. Poe, that when your things arrive, we'll stick them in--yeah. The Madrid section. That is if Leena agrees. Arthur? Pete and Myka are in Colorado Springs. Yeah, I know. I should have tried-- and so is Macpherson. What? How did he-- He was there the whole time? He had us all distracted. I think that was Macpherson's intent. Ooh. I'll take the Farnsworth. Good choice. Mm-hmm. Hey, Artie, we're heading home. Myka! Myka, listen! Myka! That was weird. - Hold on. - Vibe? Huge. Your dad. What? Is this Poe? Are we back Into the Poe thing again? I don't know. You two are good. I see why Mrs. Frederic drafted you. Ah-ah! I kill this, and it's lights out for Mom and Dad. You hurt my father. He glimpsed the mind of one of the greatest authors in the world. He'll thank me later. Oh, you'll be dead later. What do you want? I want what you risked Your lives to get. I would have done it myself, but I lacked the means. You have until the count of one. You came after family. Arthur started it. What is that supposed to mean? Ask him. Pete. Now let them go. Do it! Thank you. Consider it a loan. What the hell was that? Jack the Ripper's lantern. At least we know where that is now. He used us from the very beginning. No. He used me.
