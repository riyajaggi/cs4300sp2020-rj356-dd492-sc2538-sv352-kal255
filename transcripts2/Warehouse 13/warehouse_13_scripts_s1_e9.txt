 ARTIE: Previously on Warehouse 13... Is that... Is part of that a Bell + Howell Spectroscope? Surprise. I repurposed it. What? Without asking me? I'm only going to say this once, are you listening? Yeah. Back off! Just do as you're told, please. PETE: Vibe, it happens all the time. MYKA: So why do you trust them? (SIGHS) Well, one time I didn't and I should have. My dad was a fireman.

 He died that night in a house fire saving a couple kids. Apparently Martino and your partner were having an affair and he was married. Her history doesn't bother you? I read the press release of what went down in Denver. You're a hero. Lives were saved. Lives were lost. (POP MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Want to do a shot? Sorry, I don't drink. Sure you do. Do I know you? I haven't had a drop in five years. Probably 'cause you drank enough

 for a lifetime the night you killed me. It was an accident. It was an accident. I was 17. It was prom night. I'm so sorry. DR. COOPER: Lee? Lee, what are you doing? Lee. LEE: No. Lee, talk to me. Doc, I gotta... I have to get away from her. Lee! Lee! Damn it! (ALARM BUZZING) GUARD: We have a man down. C-Block, second tier. Stay back! We'll need a doctor down here right away! Get out of the way. Yeah, we got a... Yeah, we got a situation down here. We got to secure this... You're going to jail, missy! (CHUCKLING) (EXHALES) Well, better safe than sorry, right? MYKA: What are you talking about? Unexplained suicides up in Riverton. We are off to see the warden. You use soap on a rope? Hey, I don't judge your personal hygiene products, although you might want to invest into some moisturizers. You're a little dry around the nose. You want to swap beauty tips? Then we can talk about the hair that's sprouting from your shoulders, your nose and your ears. Ow! Or, you know, you could just tell me about the prison suicides. Well, let's go with the suicides. CLAUDIA: Inventory. What a bone. Tycho Brahe's snot pocket. Check. This place is falling apart. (GROANS) Venus de Milo's arms. Rad. You know what? I cannot work under these conditions. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) What you doing? Re-building a carburetor. That's funny. No, I mean, what's the tune? Something I've been working on for my father. Oh. How old is your father? No, I mean, that's really good for you. Can I have the keys to the cherry picker? Why? And no, you can't. I just want to fix this light bulb. It's flickering. It's really annoying. Just let it go, Claudia. You know, it's just going to burn out and you'll have me fix it later. Okay, here's the thing. You know, these bulbs, they never burn out. They're Shelby bulbs. They were invented by Adolphe Chaillet 108 years ago. So there's no need... What am I doing even talking to you? I am busy. I will tighten the bulb later. Artie. Fine. MYKA: I know you have a corner on the whole vibe thing, but this place is creepy. Well, maybe it just needs a woman's touch. HUGGINS: Agents Bering and Lattimer? Sorry to keep you waiting. There's a tropical storm headed this way and the preparations are endless. I'm Corinne Huggins, the warden. I'm not sure what the Secret Service's interest is in all this, but I expect to be kept in the loop. Of course. Good. This way. Riverton hadn't had a suicide in two years. Now, including Donaldson, we've had four in the past month. His parole had just come through, right? He had reconciled with his wife, he was looking forward to being with his family. Not a very high risk for suicide. None of them were. All four were model prisoners. Had anything new been brought in before the first suicide? Furniture? Art work? Agent Lattimer, this is a maximum security facility, not a college dormitory. There's been nothing new. No woman's touch. Right. Of course. What about new inmates? There's been a freeze on intake. We've been operating over capacity since before I took over. And when was that? Just over a month ago, just before the first suicide. I bet she's got some demonic tchotchke on her desk that she uses as a paperweight. Okay, I take back the "woman's touch" comment. My predecessor had been here quite a few years. There hasn't been much time to look at paint chips. SAM: You killed me, Bunny. HUGGINS: As it is, we've had to store his things in the anteroom closet until his estate is out of probate. PETE: Myka? Okay, so this prisoner, Donaldson, didn't leave a suicide note. Mind if I look through his stuff? SAM: You killed me, Bunny. These are his personal effects. Cool, love that. MYKA: Ouroboros. PETE: Huh? It's the snake. It's a symbol of self-reflection and cyclicity. And the best Rush album since Roll the Bones. Snakes and Arrows rocks. HUGGINS: Written by one of our inmates. His path to salvation. Creepy. Who's John Hill? JOHN: Though we're surrounded by concrete and razor wire, I can show you more freedom than the men who hold the keys. What's he in for? Killed his wife. A lot. Darkness has descended on this house. Death has returned to Riverton. And those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Dr. Cooper's ready for y'all. (INMATES CHATTERING) Regret has no place in your life. Your only salvation is here. (THUNDER RUMBLING) CLAUDIA: Artie, if you won't let me use the cherry picker, then how am I... Hmm. No way. What every fashionable girl is wearing this fall. (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) (LAUGHS) Awesome. Suck it, Magneto. (GRUNTS) Sweet. I can totally see my house from here. (EXCLAIMING) Okay. This is mildly disconcerting. (GRUNTS) (EXHALES) (SIGHS) Great. Now we know they last 108 years. And do you think freaky cult leaders are born with crazy eyes, or is it some sort of corrective surgery? Pete, what is it? You don't see that? See what? That guy standing there. It's my dad. (THUNDER RUMBLING) So, Pete saw his father, but you didn't, right? Yeah, but I should probably mention that I saw Sam earlier. What? Why didn't you say anything? Well, you know, Sam's dead and your father's dead. I mean, you can understand my reticence, right? You're both hallucinating? And when were you gonna mention that to me? Well, we just did. (THUNDER RUMBLING) What was that? Tropical Storm Inez. Uh, you didn't say that there was a storm. Why is that important? How many times do I have to tell you about electrical energy? It can crank up the intensity of an artifact, I don't know, tenfold. And if an artifact is causing these hallucinations, then a powerful electrical charge can make these visions seem absolutely real. (CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY) Well, they seem pretty real now. All right, then, listen. You're gonna have to stay in constant contact. You got that? Constant. I don't care if you have nothing to report, every hour you're going to call me, all right? And meanwhile, you're going to find out everything about these inmates who killed themselves. Start with the last one, Lee Donaldson. According to your statement, Lee said something before he jumped. "I have to get away from her. " That's what he said. I can only think he meant Claire. That's the girl he killed in the hit and run, right? He quit drinking, but never forgave himself for taking a life. Well, guilt's a powerful thing. He was your trustee, right? More than that. We were friends. I'm trained in recognizing the warning signs. I don't know why I didn't see them. Did Lee have any enemies? John Hill, Riverton's self-proclaimed messiah, leading his personal religious cult. Lee was an early convert, but after Hill started capitalizing on the suicides, Lee saw what he really was, an opportunist, preying on fear. Lee got out, and Hill didn't like losing one of his lambs. Hill may have strange religious beliefs, but he's harmless. I don't particularly like what he has to say, but you can't deny the calming effect it's had on some of the inmates. How are we today, Mr. Hill? Another day above ground, Warden. Another day above ground. Indeed. These are agents Bering and Lattimer. They'd like to ask you some questions. All right. HUGGINS: I'll be in my office. Where'd you get that necklace? Well, you could say it's always been with me. Or you could say where you got it. The object itself is of no importance. Its value lies in what it represents. And what is that? Some demand that we consume ourselves with remorse for our supposed sin. Ouroboros reminds us to transcend the cycle, and walk the path to enlightenment. No remorse, huh? What about the path to parole? I was and am his instrument on Earth, and with my hands, it is his will and not mine that is done. To feel remorse is to shame God. What about those who are remorseful? Like Donaldson. Lee's death revealed his greater purpose. A man cannot be saved without sacrifice. Oh, I see. Well, that's a neat trick, huh? PETE: Now you get to tell your boys you can protect them from sacrifice, like Donaldson. My followers are free because they know the way to freedom. SAM: You killed me, Bunny. The cruelest prison is the one that we build for ourselves out of fear and regret. I'm done. Sam? This isn't real. This can't be real. (GASPS) PETE: Hey. Sam again? Yeah. (LAUGHS) I can't move. Okay, no. No need to panic, just take off the coat. Can't take off the coat. Okay, new plan. (SIGHS) I'm so getting grounded. Incoming! Better you than me. Ow! Artie! (ECHOING) This is the last one. What is it you're looking for? I'm not sure. Anomalies, patterns. Riots. Well, that's a little specific, but sure. Sure. No. No, look. For decades, Riverton was known as "the Snake Pit." Dozens of inmates went insane here. Then in 1979, during Hurricane David, there were uncontrollable riots. I mean, the place almost burned down. Six months later, it was closed. Reopened a year later under Warden Matthews. He was here until he died last month. So what did he do differently? (THUNDER RUMBLING) Warden? You okay? I beg your pardon. The week is catching up with me. I was just asking what Matthews did differently to whip this place into shape. Well, he was very religious. He instituted daily prayers. He swore it turned the place around. That's him. Hmm. PETE: Hey, hey, hey. This looks familiar. Check out what he got rid of when he moved in. And no more riots. HUGGINS: He wasn't a very tolerant man. Anything he thought was pagan he had taken out. MYKA: Well, let's go see the good reverend. PETE: Goodbye, snakes and arrows. And that should take care of that. Warden, I had your permission to wear that. HUGGINS: I'm not sure I understand. What exactly is the danger? I'm sorry. We can't disclose that information. HUGGINS: Well, I was quite clear, you get free reign of my institution, I get some answers. Please don't misconstrue our silence as disrespect. It's just beyond our authority to tell you. Yeah, but I'm pretty sure there won't be any more suicides. Cause of death, brain hemorrhage due to blunt force trauma. Final report to come. LEE: You could have helped me, Doctor. Lee, I'm sorry. I tried, I did. I thought you were my friend. You ignored the warning signs. You let me die, Doctor. Stop, Lee! Lee, I'm your friend! You killed me, Doctor. (GRUNTING) Listen to me! HUGGINS: You told me the suicides would stop. Now we have another one. Clearly, you're not able to help, and you're not being truthful with me about what's going on. I promise you, Warden, we have told you everything that we know. Oh, really? And what exactly are you looking for? Well, it could be anything. Look, sometimes freaky stuff causes other freaky stuff to happen. After the storm passes, I expect you two to be gone. I'm going to request a federal team of investigators. Okay, so he was here alone and he was depressed about Donaldson. Medical examiners record their autopsy findings. Maybe he has a recorder around here somewhere. Right. So look for one. Well... Fine, I'll do it. Well, I'm over here. I'll do it. I'll do it. Okay. God. Sorry, I just want to lift your... Hey, Myka. Okay, play it. DR. COOPER: Lee, I'm sorry. I tried, I did. (STATIC BUZZING) Lee, I'm sorry. You're my friend! (STATIC BUZZING) Okay, okay, so now he's talking to the dead guy, but he should know better. He's a doctor. What's that static sound? Did you hear that? Yeah. Play it again. Okay. DR. COOPER: Lee, I'm sorry. I tried, I did. (STATIC BUZZING) Lee, I'm sorry. You're my friend! (STATIC BUZZING) Did you hear that? Yeah, it sounded like, I don't know, bad cell phone service. ARTIE: That's 10,000 cycles per second. It could be the electrical interference that any natural material makes when it vibrates. Okay, so where does it come from? Well, any number of minerals or heavy metals, or it could be an artifact that contains both. But just give me a second, just one... Ah! (STATIC BUZZING) Uh... Yeah, okay, does that sound familiar? MYKA: That's it. So, Artie, we're looking for some kind of a mineral artifact that causes hallucinations. (METALLIC CLANGING) Is that banging? Do you hear a... Yeah, no... You do that, you do that. But I... PETE: Artie? Hello? What... No, I'm okay. I'm okay. I just... You know what? Artie, we got it. Thanks. We'll call you later. Yeah, all right. (CLANGING CONTINUES) S-O... SOS? (ECHOING) Claudia! Claudia! Claudia! Claudia! Artie! Hi, Artie. Hi. Huh. Funny story. So I kind of tried to fix this light bulb, even though you expressly told me not to. And, man, have I learned my lesson. You were so right about this place. You just never know what to expect. (GRUNTS) Okay, you're pissed. Can we move past that part for now, and get to the part where you get me down from here? That wouldn't be Volta's lab coat that you're wearing? All part of the hilarious story I should really tell you when I'm back on planet Earth. The reason, Claudia, that Volta's lab coat is in the Warehouse is because Volta couldn't control its magnetic field, as you may have noticed. Each metallic object that it connects to makes the coat stronger and stronger. That explains so much. Thank you. (EXCLAIMS) My glasses. Those better not be scratched! You know, when I was in Girl Scouts, we would make these little mini-metal detectors so we could hunt for gold. Most speakers are coated with a polymer film that picks up VHF frequencies, but we never found any gold, but we did find a lot of worthless minerals. Uh-huh. Mmm-hmm. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I want you to know that you can tell me things. I got the report about Denver. What did it say? I don't know, I didn't read it. Intellectually, I know I did everything by the book. Of course you did. You're you. What if I missed something, Pete? What if it's my fault? Myka, the only person responsible for Sam's death is the piece of garbage that pulled the trigger that day. You protected the President. That's the gig. You're a hero and so is Sam. Okay? Yeah. Okay? Mmm-hmm. That's a cool-ass science project. Yeah, it's... (SNIFFLES) You know, it's... (STATIC BUZZING) It's not working. (CRACKLING) Sounds like it's working. No, it's not. It's just crackling at everything. Well, maybe there's minerals everywhere. Well, there can't... How can there be... Minerals. The miners... Mine! They are everywhere, including in the ground. Come on. Thank you. I'm sorry about the... MYKA: Look. Quartz mines. Quartz. Do you see? This building was built on an old quartz mine. And back then, indigenous materials would have been used when building a new structure. Quartz as in the mineral? As in hallucination-inducer. As in this whole freaking structure is one giant tuning fork and mother nature's just banging away. Okay, now I've got these magnets. They're attached to this thing. When I let go, they're coming right at you. They'll stick to you and the stuff near you. Okay, here they come! Ow! (EXHALES) Okay, they're on. Would it have killed you to put a warning label on this thing? Saying what, "Only put on in case of stupid"? Ugh. Just bottom-line this for me, Artie. Worst-case scenario? Oh, why not? The entire warehouse buckles in on itself, crushing us both to death. (CLANGING) Okay, yeah, I changed my mind. Sugar-coat it. Okay, it must be the storm, because I can't get any reception. Okay, so the whole building is causing hallucinations, right? Right. So, maybe we should start thinking about what stopped them for 30 years. Okay, so the prison opens. Right. There's a hurricane, suddenly there's a ton of violence, the prison closes, it reopens with a new warden and suddenly the violence stops. Right. He dies. Uh-huh. His stuff goes into storage. Uh-huh. The suicides start. Mmm-hmm. I don't know. Maybe the old Bible-banger had something that was curing the crazy. Right. Maybe this is what Mrs. Frederic meant by endless freaking wonder. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Let's go. Yeah, let's get... Yeah, let's get out of here 'cause it's... (MYKA CLEARS THROAT) Warden? Warden Huggins! Go! MYKA: Warden, what's wrong? It's locked. Have you got the keys? Stop. Stop. I'm sorry! Okay, he's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. (BANGING ON DOOR) Warden Huggins, this is Agent Bering. Are you all right? Get back, Dr. Cooper! No, that's not true! (YELLS) (WHIMPERS) Look out. Let me bust the door down. But it's... It's... Ready? One, two, three. (GRUNTING) It's a warden's door. It's probably sturdier than most. Well, I wish you would have said that about five seconds ago. HUGGINS: No. Get away from me! That's not a good sign. We have to go through the ex-warden's stuff in storage. (INMATES CLAMORING) (GUARDS SCREAMING) (MUMBLING) DR. COOPER: You can't keep us out, Corinne. You'll never control this prison. How many more have to die by your hand? I mean, how much "World's Greatest Warden" crap can you have? We don't even know what we're looking for. Why would this time be any different? Okay, look, give me the Farnsworth. I'm going to try Artie again. JOHN: Don't let the vision of demons fool you, brothers. It appears that Riverton is now the land of the blind, and we are its one-eyed kings. (FARNSWORTH RINGING) Just a minute. Yeah? Artie. Artie, thank God. Okay, what shuts down quartz? Of course it's quartz. It's quartz, right. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. I should have known. Quartz. Artie... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, listen. Um... Pierre Curie, his brother Jacques, they proved the existence of a converse effect of piezoelectricity. You know what that is, don't you? Yeah. Yeah. So, what you've got to do is you... CLAUDIA: (GASPS) Artie! Yeah, sorry. Yeah. Okay, the frequency of a piece of quartz can be completely canceled out by its proximity to a second piece of quartz. Now the second piece is probably what the artifact... I'm having a little... The image is breaking up. It's a large piece, okay? (MUMBLING) Is the storm... worse? A lot. When you find the artifact, you got to put it exactly... Exactly... before... ...proximity... the original frequency... ...essential... Artie! Artie! (GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION) Okay, big piece of quartz in the closet. Hey, hello. Can we get back to me, Artie? There's a bicycle on me. We're going to have to reduce the magnetic field, but we're going to do it very gradually. And we have to do that just because we wouldn't want to destroy your central nervous system. No. No, we wouldn't. We would not. (METALLIC CREAKING) Hey, what is that? That sounds bad. What is that? (CREAKING CONTINUES) Artie! Artie! (HUGGINS SCREAMING) Box of crap. Box of crap. Warden, whatever you're seeing, it's not real. You're perfectly safe. (HUGGINS SOBBING) PETE: It's the cross. Uh... Claudia, new plan. But, listen, you have to do exactly, exactly as I say. Got that? You're the man! Stay right there. What? Bingo. You found it? (HUGGINS WAILING) What is it that they say about those who live by the sword? Stand aside, please. Is that some sort of prison term for "You're a dead woman"? I can't take the door off its hinges if you're standing in front of it. Do you really think we're just gonna let you in there? If the prison is in an uproar, that means the warden is in trouble. She's always supported my work. I would like to help. (HUGGINS SCREAMING) (GLASS SHATTERING) JOHN: Good? MAN: Yeah, yeah. MYKA: Warden, no. Wait! JOHN: Get out of here. Let's move. Get out! (GRUNTS) (STATIC BUZZING) SAM: Target has arrived. Repeat, target has arrived. Sam? Sam? It's happening again. PETE'S DAD: You should have warned me, Petey. Dad? If you knew I was never coming home, why didn't you say something? SAM: Repeat, target is on the move. Let's move in. Negative. Negative. The plan is to extract at the stairs. Sam, wait! (GUN FIRES) I was a kid. It was just a feeling. I was afraid. Well, it's time to be a man. Take responsibility for your actions. Your fears, your regrets. SAM: It's your fault. You were late. Was I? You killed me, Bunny, and now you've got to make it right. PETE'S DAD: Time to pay the price, boy. The cruelest prison is the one we build for ourselves out of fear and regret. What? Not a day goes by that I don't miss you, but you would have gone to work that morning whether I would have warned you or not, and I have no more regret... JOHN: Regret... ...about not stopping you. And I have no more fear... ...out of fear... ...that I did the wrong thing. Regret has no place in your life. It wasn't my fault. It's just... It's who you were. And who I try and be every day of my life. JOHN: The cruelest prison is the one that we build for ourselves. Stay away from me, Sam! (PANTING) Myka. Myka, listen to me. You can fight this. Okay? You know what happened in Denver. All your planning and preparations, they weren't enough. You know the truth. Don't be afraid of it. This is the report. Remember? You know what's in it. (SNIFFLING) Don't be afraid. Sam said I killed him. You know that's not the truth. Myka, listen, you don't need a report to tell you what you already know in your heart. You did everything right. Sam didn't listen to you. That's why he's dead. He screwed up. Not you. Do you understand? Now tell Sam the truth. I'm sorry, Sam. Sorry's not going to bring me back, Bunny. I'm sorry because you made the mistake, not me. You were late. No. No. You were early. The target made you and you got yourself killed. (SNIFFLING) I love you, Sam. I always will. (CRYING) But I have to move on. I have to move on. Wow, it's... You okay? It's getting worse. Yeah, I'm fine. What are we going to do with this? Okay. Artie said... The picture in the old warden's office... Right. Right. Yes. So it was there. (BOTH GRUNT) CLAUDIA: Hurry, Artie! ARTIE: Oh, good idea! CLAUDIA: What is that? It sounds like a truck. No, there's no truck. Oh, my God! All right, it's a truck. Wait, wait. (METALLIC GRINDING) Come on! Come on! ARTIE: Hang on! (GRINDING CONTINUES) Hey, what's that for? To get rid of the body? No, it's a good backup plan if this doesn't work. What do you mean if it doesn't work? I don't think I'm going to like this. Whoa, girl! Come and get me! Artie, no, don't do it! No, please, Artie! Oh, God, I hope you're a good shot. Please, Artie, please be good at this. Just don't move! Okay! I promise I'll be good from now on! Grab it! Okay, I'm trying. CLAUDIA: Got it. (CLAUDIA SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) Artemis Maximus! (CHUCKLES) That was awesome! Yeah, it kind of was awesome, wasn't it? Yeah. All right, let's get out of here. You got to take that off right away. Okay. Now. Now. Yeah. Oh, God. Hey, are you hurt? No. No, I'm fine. What happened? Well, it's a long story. I hope you like the cross. Pete! Oh, my God. Help me. HUGGINS: What happened? Oh, God. PETE: Oh, man. Okay, okay, he's losing a lot of blood. We got to get him out of here. No, no, no. No. No. (CHUCKLES) It's all right. He's chosen me for sacrifice. (PANTING) I'm on a new path. (SIGHS) How many times do I have to write this, Artie? Okay. All right. Claudia, all right. Okay. You know what? No. Yeah. Enough of doing it that way. All right. So, now, Claudia. Okay. Now focus, don't just write it. Believe it. No. Yes. Oh. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) How long you been working on that? Since I lost my father. Artie, I'm sorry. When did he die? He's alive. I just hope that finishing this will help us find each other again. Myka! Yeah? Hey. Hey. So listen, I'm taking the girls out for a little night on the town. You know, which in this part of South Dakota means going for ice cream. Mmm-hmm. You want to come? I'm beat. All right. You want me to bring you something back? You know I don't eat sugar. Right. Butter pecan, caramel sauce, chocolate sprinkles. (CHUCKLES) You all right? I'm good. You know... All right, well, remember, if you want to talk... Maybe tomorrow. I'll have my people call your people. You do that. Bye. Bye. (FIRE CRACKLING)
