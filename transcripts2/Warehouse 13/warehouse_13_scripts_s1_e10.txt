 Previously on Warehouse 13... That'll take you directly to who has the sword, and that will lead you... to MacPherson. Who? I wasn't here when everything went down between Artie and MacPherson, but I know it was bad. It's called the past rearing its ugly head. And someone out there is running around using the... That someone is MacPherson. He wanted more than the sword. He wanted to mess us up as a team. Now it's up to you to stop him.

 Hello. Done! I win! It's not a race. Said the tortoise to the hare. You know, in the story, the tortoise actually wins. It's a fairy tale. How is a turtle gonna beat a rabbit? It's not a fairy tale. It's a fable, a life lesson. Slow and steady wins the race. Okay, here's a life lesson: Pete fast, Pete win. You all finished? If you were making a bet, who's faster, a turtle or a rabbit? Yeah, you finished the report? Yeah. Who are these going to? Not Mrs. Frederic. Yeah, she doesn't seem like the paperwork type.

 No, these go above all our pay grades. Who? Myka, one day you will know all answers to all questions, just not today. Okay, fine. Enjoy your top secrets. I just gotta go. I just can't leave that courier waiting. What? A courier? What is this, the Wells Fargo wagon? Haven't you ever heard of email? No, that's not nearly secure enough, because we... It doesn't matter. You are having a day to yourselves, right? Have fun. Claudia's doing chores. And I'll see you later. - Doing chores where? - In the Warehouse. Scalpel. Thank you, nurse. There's an awful lot of blood. I need some suction. Ganza! Good as new. And get into the corners this time. Don't make me push you. Go on. Warm. Frosty goodness. Okay, "repair auto-vac." Slice-o-pie. "Tighten and lubricate zip line." Sounds kind of dirty when you say it like that. God, ancient junk-oleum. You got to update this turd someday, Artie. Be careful! Crap! Crappity, crap, crap, crap! Oh, my God! This is not good! This is not gonna look good on my report card! Oh, my God. Okay, don't panic. Oh, that's far. WWAD. What would Artie do? Momentum! Got to get momentum. All right. Come on, momentum. Let's go! This sucks! So if it isn't Mrs. Frederic, then who's getting those reports? I don't know, Mr. Frederic? I brought donuts. Donut. Chocolate. - What's "AD"? - Artifact disturbance. You know, you really need to read the manual. That can't be good. Projet-SG (1.00) I was just wondering... I was hoping that you could take a message to the higher-ups for me. This MacPherson situation... They prefer a hands-off approach but... You're talking. - We don't talk. - I didn't think that was a rule. I just thought you weren't particularly social. I see I was right about that. Oh, God. She would like a word. I'm sure she would. Let's just follow the zip line. She's bound to turn up. I just hope she's okay, you know? Claudia's like bamboo. You can bend her all you want, but she'll never break. - This is hers. - How do you know? We have to get rid of Artie's bedazzler. Is that a dodgeball? How did that get in here? Hell, no. Did that just do what I think it did? Gosh. - Is that thing having babies or...? - Yeah. Look. - Let's get out of here. - Okay. Those things hit us every time we look away. Yeah, I'm gonna go with you on that, so I don't end up with a concussion. - The screen. - What? Yes. Let's... Let's read the screen. "Baylor dodgeball. "Used for military dexterity and agility training. Multiplies upon contact." That we already know. "Acquired after the... Bludgeoning deaths of five cadets in 1972." - Bludgeoning is bad. - Agreed. Okay, there's a neutralizing station around the corner. There should be. Ready? On three. Three! Let's see how these puppies like a neutralizer flea bath. Why isn't it working? Okay, this is bad. What's happening? Why isn't it working? I don't know. It's busted. Okay, what do we do now? Plan "B." - What's plan "B"? - I was hoping that you knew. Okay, wait. What's that one? "Breathe underwater." "Hear colors." "Grow fingernails fast." "Summon locusts." That's not... - They're dodgeballs. - Yes, that's already established. That's how you win at dodgeball. You have to catch it. No, these are too fast. What about that whole "death by bludgeoning" thing? You look away, right? When they go for you, I'll catch one. - We should go with plan "C". - What's plan "C"? - I run away, and you get pummeled. - Look! God! Who smells like tuna fish now, Ralph Brunsky? Who? Who? I was just... I was having a little playground flashback. Hi, there. Welcome to Ted's. I'm Theadora, but everybody calls me Ted. Party of one? I'm meeting that woman right over there. And it's rarely a party. Arthur, have a seat. - Why are we meeting here? - We need to have a chat. Pie of the day is banana cream. I highly recommend it. Made it myself. Steak, bloody, black coffee, two pieces of the pie. Two? Just house salad. Leena's got me on a diet. Maybe just one piece of that pie, please. She made it herself. - How are things at the Warehouse? - They're good. They're fine. A little chaotic, but it's a good kind of chaos. And the missions? No one's been killed. You can't ask for more than that. And we have an excellent retrieval rate. What about the incidents in Paris or Las Vegas or Colorado? Mrs. Frederic, you know all about those. Why are you asking me about them? I'm forgetful. Refresh my memory. You were saying about Paris? Claudia, there's half a donut in the office. How far she could've gotten before the zip line snapped? Could be the other end of the Warehouse. - There's an end? - I hope so. Okay, that was bigger than usual. To hell with this. I'm gonna see if I can spot her from up here. Well, be careful. What is it? Go down the aisle, cross two over, and turn right. It's Leena's. But how? And there's a Claudia-shaped hole in the roof. - Are you here? - Wait, you guys... Don't close the... - door. - Thank God, you're... We were following the zip line, and the... No, I'm good. I mean, we're all trapped in here for eternity, but, otherwise I'm solid. Okay. Let's just get back to the office, so we can fix the... What? What? What the hell? This is what I've been saying. First the goo doesn't work. Then one of those static balls tries to cook us. And now a clingy house. The Warehouse is in a bad mood today. FYI, if anyone has to use the bathroom, don't flush. - Trust me. - Okay, you know what? We just have to wait and think about this for a second. New plan. Scoring that an 8.5. Next time you got to stick the landing. Let's all just stop and think about this a second. That's a good plan. Did you try climbing back out of the same hole that you fell in? Came right back through the fireplace. I don't recommend it. And you trust Pete and Myka? With my life. They're consummate professionals. I have to ask you, why, specific... Excuse me. We're having a private... Do you mind? No. That's all right. What is he... Very sorry. Private party. - Wait, what is going on? - I thought they would never leave. Okay, here we go. You be careful, now. This is a hot plate. I think we can begin. Mr. Valda. - Hello, Irene. - Mr. Valda, nice to see you again. - This is agent Nielsen. - Just a minute. - What is this? - That's a house salad. Bering and Lattimer are consummate professionals. Thank you, Theodora. So as you stated in the past, agents Bering and Lattimer's mission was... Do you mind telling me exactly what is happening here? Mr. Valda's asking the questions. Please don't interrupt him. I don't think I'm gonna be answering any questions until you tell me what this is about. Sometimes he forgets we answer to a higher authority. What higher authori... ty? The regents. These are the regents? The regents meet here? - They do today. - You really expect me to believe... What exactly were you expecting, agent Nielsen? Hooded, cloaked figures standing in half-light around a perpetually burning flame? He's seen too many movies. I just would have thought that... This waitress is a regent? John Adams was a farmer. Abraham Lincoln was a small-town lawyer. Plato, Socrates were teachers. Jesus was a carpenter. To equate judgment and wisdom with occupation is at best... Insulting. - That's not what I meant. - I know what you meant. Who would you have control the Warehouse? Kings? Popes? Politicians? - There'd be nothing left of it. - No, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. It's just... - I didn't think. - Yes. That's one of the reasons we needed to speak with you. Your reluctance to think. - Irene. - Mrs. Frederic. Thank you. So as I was saying, you stated in the past that agents Bering and Lattimer's mission was to snag it, bag it, and tag it. Correct? Well, I didn't mean to denigrate the job description. Yet, in their brief tenure as field agents, they managed to destroy James Braid's chair. Let me explain. - Lewis Carroll's mirror. - That wasn't destroyed. Your agents released a malevolent entity into the Warehouse, allowing it access to dangerous artifacts. An accident. It was a total accident. It is not uncommon for artifacts to be occasionally destroyed for the greater good. Agents Lattimer and Bering have shown bravery and quick thinking. It's an excellent team. They're probably the best agents that the Warehouse has ever had. Their abilities are not in question here. - This is about me? - Not only you. Your former partner. MacPherson. Okay, so this version of the B&B; is in the Warehouse because... It's an artifact. Can this whole place be an artifact? Like, is that even possible? Pretty much anything is possible. So maybe there was an artifact in the original that they couldn't take out, right? So they just moved the whole thing. And rebuilt the new one without it. Look for anything here that's different from our B&B.; All right! That was cool. We had this little group-think thing going on. Gold stars all around. I do not recognize that chair. You were sleeping in it last week. What about this ugly lamp? Those lightbulbs burnt out a month ago, but this... this is new. Or old. It's fused to the wall. This is it. It's a painting of this room. And we can't leave this room. Seems like quite the coinky-dink, don't you think? Yeah, how very Salvador Dali. Do you think it keeping us here? Maybe. Pete, look at the lamp. - What? - Okay, now look at the painting. Claudia put it back in a different spot. It changed because of what you did. Okay, okay, so maybe... if I do something... to the picture. That happens. Sick! After you. - Your turn. - Don't mind if I do. Don't even bother. At least that was new. Oh, man. You know what? This thing is useless! - Did I do that? - Well, neither of us did. I can see the Warehouse. There's, a letter opener, if I remember... Yes! Let's go. All right, safe and sound. What? That. Maybe we should have stayed inside. - We need to get back to the office. - No need. "Why you wasting time installing backup terminals in the aisle, foolish girl?" 'cause you never know when you might need one. Nice. Okay, looks like the problem is in the gooery. - What's a gooery? - I'm guessing it's Claudia-speak for the neutralizer processing center. - Right. Of course. - Well, it's chapter 197 in the manual. It's 1,000 pages long. I'll wait for the movie. Okay, the neutralizer processing center is what pumps the purple goo in the Warehouse, creating a stability field. It's like all the gak in here are nuclear rods. As long as there's coolant. The gooery jakes out the coolant. It keeps the artifacts from getting all artifacty on their own. Okay, so the gooery, cool name by the way, - needs to go back online. - Man with a plan. Okay, so does chapter 198 say what happens - if we don't get it working again? - The same thing that happens to the nuclear rods without the coolant, except probably worse. I'm guessing when we get to 100%, we have China syndrome. We've got maybe half an hour left. - What's the fastest way? - Let me see. We got to go through aisle haddonfield-79, then loop around carlsbad-22. No, no, why don't we just go straight through here? 'Cause that's the dark vault. See, I know what that is. Didn't read the manual. That's where all the dangerous stuff is. Yeah, like, mega-dangerous, dude. Mondo. Okay, but we still can't loop around. I say we take the risk. I agree. It's not often that I agree, but I agree. Guys, if we're gonna do this thing, let's do this thing. Wait, no, no. You're not going anywhere. You're gonna stay put. - I'm coming with. - No, no. We're the agents. We're agreed to risk our lives, not you. But this is my home too. You might need my help. She's right. She has read the manual. Am I never gonna hear the end of that? She knows this place, okay? I say that she comes with. - Please? - Okay, fine, but you stick close. And you do exactly as we say. All right. Suicide mission with the team. I'm excited. I'm excited. Come on! And in attempting to save Joshua Donovan, you placed his sister, yet another civilian, - in danger. - I'm sorry. Excuse me, please. If this is about Macpherson, then why am I being asked about cases that have absolutely nothing to do with Macpherson? I will ask the questions. It might be wise to let this run its course for now. All right, fine. Fine. Yes. In saving Joshua, I maybe put Claudia in a little... - Danger. But I promised her that if... - You promised? You promised? Sounds as if personal feelings became involved in professional judgment. This has been an issue in the past, has it not? It may have come up. But his artifact-retrieval rate is excellent. It's the highest in years. - Thank you. - Simply the facts. Very well, then. The facts. Thank you, Theadora. Did you or did you not on two separate occasions involve... Daniel Dickinson, a high-ranking secret service officer, in Warehouse 13 matters, all of which were classified at the highest level? Yes. We have a unique relationship with the united states government. A relationship that your actions have now complicated. I contacted a fellow government official in the normal course of performing my job, a job to which I have dedicated the last 40 years of my life. No one's questioning your dedication, Arthur. What we are questioning, agent Nielsen, is your future. It's sealed with an omega level security code. - Can you hack it? - Pope, catholic. You know the drill. And... Done. Man, this place is creep-tastic. Don't look, don't touch. Just keep moving. These objects are so dangerous, they can only be controlled by purple containment fields. Why are the neutralizer systems still working in here? Backup generators, 'cause everything's so dangerous. Don't worry, they should hold up long enough for us to... realize my karma sucks. We're starting to lose them. Just keep moving. - This is gonna take me a minute. - Is it a different code? Yeah, I got to use an FTL-ASCII binary algorithm. - Did you just make that up? - Hey, little guy. What you in for? Almost there. Hang in there, guys. We're good. Okay, let's go. Pete, what are you... Wait, wait, wait, wait! - Crap! - Pete, what are you doing? Pete, can you hear me? Pete, are you okay? Pete, are you okay? Attention, Warehouse agents. Mrs. Frederic. Thank God. Emergency evacuation required. Repeat, emergency evacuation required. Mrs. F, we're down here. Energy levels approaching critical mass. That's a recording. Emergency evacuation required. - That's the most I've heard her say. - I know. Well, this is a whole nother code level. It's gonna take me a few minutes. Sorry. You know what? Step aside. Just stand over there. Emergency evacuation required. Okay, that was flat-out awesome. - What are you doing, man? We gotta go. - Wait! Wait! Stop, stop, stop! The circle. I think it's there for a reason. Right? What you doing? Nothing. He's looking at a typewriter. It's not just any typewriter. It's Sylvia Plath's. She wrote this poem called "Ennui", and ultimately she took her own life in a... I spent some serious time in the Bell Jar. I know who Sylvia Plath is. Right. What's that thing doing to him? It's sucking the life out of him. We have to get him out of the containment field. Pete, can you come here? Why? What's the point? - What do we do? - There's no time. You go up to the gooery, get it online. I'll stay here and deal with this. What, like, just on my own or...? Claudia, you know this Warehouse, okay? I trust you. Right. Yeah. No, I'll just... I'll do it, then. Get going. Tick tock. - I have a few more questions. - Do you? Really? Yeah, I have a few of my own. - Arthur, don't do anything foolish. - This exercise is a pointless and insulting waste of time. - I asked you not to do this. - If MacPherson is out there... What? If? If? If? I have a wound right here, right here, in my shoulder that should prove it. He's out there. And he's planning something far worse than any of you can imagine. What are you doing about it? You're tying my hands! You leave us no choice. You say MacPherson is a threat. And you use that to justify violating Warehouse protocol time and time again. Pretty soon, you're gonna be making up your own rules just to sanction your actions. Does that sound familiar, agent Nielsen? Sound like someone we both knew? Mr. Valda, he knows the rules. He knows that I'm forced to follow them. Don't you see that? And if I'm gonna take MacPherson, and I am, then rules have to be broken. That's the only thing that'll work. You know what's not gonna work? Reining in the one person that can stop him before it's too late. Look at all of you. You're not out in the field! You're here, hiding in plain sight. What are you doing? You're judging me. You're judging my methods, because... You're afraid of him. Tell me I'm wrong. Mr. Valda, look at me. You tell me right to my face, tell me I'm wrong. Either fire me or kill me or let me do my job. You better make a decision, and you better make it fast before he makes it for you. I believe the ball is in your court. Okay, Pete, we're running out of time here. Okay, look, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take off my belt, all right? I'm gonna throw it to you, you grab it, and I'll pull you out of there. Whatever. Grab the belt. Pete, grab the belt. Pete, grab it. Grab the belt! You're a rabbit, right? Pete, you're not a tortoise, so win, win the race. Just grab it. Win, lose. What's the diff? Warehouse, give me something. Give me something... Thank you. You again. Are you okay? What was that? Okay, listen, we're running out of time. The Warehouse is about to explode. Okay, so just... Come on. Critical mass in five minutes. Critical mass in five minutes. Really? Cliche much? Gross. Well, it's not so bad. It kind of smells like chicken. Critical mass in four minutes. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. I'm just a little drained, that's all. - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. You go. Thank you. Okay, ugly, I'm just gonna pull you out. This is slippery. Gloves are coming off. Now I want Italian food. Not the plan. Nope. Critical mass in three minutes. I know it looks like I'm having a bunch of fun, but help! Almost there. - Don't touch. Way too sticky. - What? No point in us both getting ground up. What is this stuff? If I remember properly, it's hours of fun for the whole family. They lied. It's not even minutes of fun, really. Where's Pete? Still bored out of his mind? No, he'll be here in a minute. Just keep pulling. Critical mass in two minutes. Mind if I yell? I'm gonna yell. Help! Chicks! You have to find something to cut this stuff! By "stuff," you don't mean our arms, right? Don't touch it! It's sticky. Attention, Warehouse agents, energy levels are now at omega level. Critical mass in one minute. We're boned. - How much time did she just say? - 50 seconds. See? See? Even on tape, she still... Just please go find something! My tool belt. - What? - Right there. Get the snow globe. I got it. Use it to freeze the gears. I got a better idea. Hold on! Hold on. 30 seconds. You guys got to pull really hard. Right... now! Attention, Warehouse agents, emergency abated. - Nice work. - Thank you. God. How do you do that? That was quite a performance. Sounded better in my head. So am I fired? Worse. They want you to stay. Bering and Lattimer are not the best agents we've ever had. You are. - They said that? - It was said. And they were smart enough to believe me. Thanks. Simply the fact. What about MacPherson? Good hunting. Try not to get yourself killed. Don't try to be all friendly with me now. I just wanted to say thanks for... you know, trusting me before. I know what it's like to be your age and have no one believe in you. You're good. No, you're really good. You'll be fine. Thanks. You know, if you're not busy later, maybe you could show me how to do that... kick thing, 'cause I tried it on a light switch, and I think I broke my toe. And I know I broke the light switch. That would be... That would be fun, you know? And maybe you could teach me how to hack into the... The grid? - You wanna hack the grid? - I wanna hack the grid. I'm down. I cleaned up the last of the mess. You know, I bet Artie won't even notice. Won't notice what? Your welcome-back surprise party. Surprise! You look surprised. Doesn't he look surprised? Tell me. The zip line crashed, and there were these dodgeballs... And some glop got in the gooery gears. - We went to the dark vault... - Things got sparky... We fixed it. We fixed everything. - Good as new. It's all fixed. - Totally. How long did you have before the Warehouse was gonna explode? - Under a minute. - More like 30 seconds. That's lucky. I once got there with 17, and her voice gets really annoying when she's counting down seconds one at a time. You didn't lose that thing I had made for you, did you? - Great. That's good. - It survived. Wait, are we not in trouble? You guys had it under control, right? That we did, amigo. That we did. I don't know about you, but I'm starving. - Who wants Mexican? - I do. Need tacos stat. - ¿Tu venga? - ¿Por que no? No, I had pie. Well, I almost had pie. But go, go, go. Enjoy yourselves. Enjoy yourselves. - Now I want pie. - You always want pie. Who doesn't want pie? Maybe just bring me one taco? Whatever. And rest up... Because you're gonna need it.
