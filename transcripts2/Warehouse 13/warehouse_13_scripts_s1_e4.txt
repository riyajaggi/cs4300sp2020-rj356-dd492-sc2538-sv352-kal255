 PETE: Previously on Warehouse 13... Can we get back to the Warehouse computers being breached? Somebody is poking around in your system. I should never have told you. Warehouse 13. I got hacked. Hey, does Artie seem a little, you know, crankier than usual? Who's there? MAN: Got to stop... Got to stop her! Someone's there. I can... What the hell was that? LEENA: Artie, what are you gonna do? I know this place.

 I know this place. Yes. You've been here before. You don't remember it, but you will. So, this is a dream? It's time to get up, Artie. It's time to go. Where am I going? Back to the beginning. (FARNSWORTH RINGING) Yeah? No more zoos, okay? From now on, if an artifact is at a zoo, we leave it there. Monkeys spit. Artie, do you know that?

 They spit and it is not worth it. Guys, guys, guys... Tell him about the cheetahs. No, I don't want to think about the cheetahs, all right? I just want a bath. All right, I'm sorry about all that. I'm dealing with a lot here, too, okay? Right, have you found out who's hacking into the Warehouse? I can't pinpoint the origin of the breach. It's a little frustrating. Sleep, Artie, you look terrible. Thank you very much. You still have some monkey phlegm in your hair. It's not phlegm. Look, Artie... Just... Myka's right, get some rest, bro. Okay? Yeah. (MONKEYS SCREECHING) Just get back here as soon as possible. We have a lot to do, okay? (SIGHS) (GROANS) No, I can't get up. Yes, you can. Try. I can't... How did you get in here? I'm disappointed, Artie. I figured you'd have me totally clocked by now. Do I know you? What's going on? I'm hurt. Well, it was a while ago. I was a lot younger. So were you. Looking for this? Dude, an alarm system? So not groovy. Besides, this is you-and-me time right now. Yeah, it's funny. Years ago, I swear you said you were just a simple professor. I guess you left out the off-the-grid, top-secret warehouse full of madcap. Claudia. Claudia Donovan. You're the breach. (IN SING-SONG TONE) Knock, knock. Yeah. I'm sorry. I really don't have time for games. These cuffs, they're not going to stop me. I know, but check this. (GROANS) I super-charged the cuffs, see? Twenty thousand volts. Designed them myself. You like? Well done. Thank you. Now chill, I'm not in the mood. Kid, look, that was a long, long, long time ago, that stuff. Time flies, Professor. Really does. (GROANS) I'm not responsible for Joshua's death. Claudia, look, just stop it right now before you do something you regret. I regret? Me? Have you got it backasswards. You're responsible for what happened. But, hey, it's all good. You know why? 'Cause it's payback time for me and for Joshua. So, let's go, Artie. Time to make good on your promise. The door's open. PETE: That's not good. Artie would never leave his Farnsworth. Yeah. If there were trouble, Artie would have triggered the... Alarm? Someone took Artie? Damn it, I don't know what else to do! The cache is wiped. There's no tracks outside and there's no clues in here. All right. Don't worry, okay? We'll figure it out somehow. Don't worry? (FARNSWORTH RINGING) Could that be Artie? I'm calling for Artie. You two are decidedly not he. Mrs. Frederic, hi. Look, we got some really bad news. Look, Artie's gone, someone took him. That doesn't happen. Agents don't get taken out of the Warehouse. Our security system is... So... I see. The person who's breached the security, he's taken Artie. PETE: Yeah. Any idea who this guy is? None. So, can we put out an APB or alert the authorities? We are the authorities. What did you learn from the durational spectrometer? The spectro... It shows the after images of anyone who's been in the room in the last five hours. (SCOFFS) Are you kidding me? Yeah, that's like our favorite thing, with all the lights and so forth. Once you've ID'd them, let me know. And stay put. I don't need three missing agents. Okay, but, Mrs. Frederic, look, if we have a lead, we could just... Consider yourself under lockdown. ARTIE: I know this place. It's a lab. It's Joshua's old lab. Come on, away from the door. I'm fine right here. Think so? Or there. There is very good, too. You're doing this all wrong, Claudia. Brought me here in daylight. Used my car. Those are amateur moves, Claudia, and for what? What are you going to do to me? You're going to kill me? Because a long, long time ago, your brother died in an accident? Come on. He's not dead. Claudia? Claudia, it was a terrible, terrible accident, but we both witnessed it and he's gone. No, no, no, no, he's not. He's stuck. Listen to yourself. Look, this isn't in my head. You're gonna see. Be careful. Okay. Okay. Let's... Let's open this baby up and see what she's got. (LAUGHS) That's cool. Wow. Okay. All right. That is crazy. Okay. Wow. Okay. Okay. Strange person with Artie. Who is that? I don't know. Who... Who is that? (STAMMERING) Hold on. I don't know. Hang on. Do you have it? Yes. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Okay. There we go. And... That's... Okay. That's weird. Did you see that? Is he saying something? What is he saying? Do you... Yeah. Go. Go. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah. That's a trip. It's... I can't. Claudia Donovan. How did you... My sister taught me how to read lips. Why does your sister... The deaf find it handy. You... Okay. Claudia Donovan, where are you now? Mrs. Frederic said we should stay here. Really? I didn't hear that. Neither did I. Uh-oh. Looks like she was institutionalized. What if she's dangerous, Pete? So, okay. This is what? This is poetic justice? Bringing me back where it all started? No, we're here because it's strongest here. We need that if you're going to bring Joshua back. Back? Nice job on these, by the way. What's conducting the charge? Is that lithium filaments? Very fine craftsmanship. Dude, just shut up now. Dude, can we not... Claudia, you're not well. All right. Joshua's death was... He got the rules wrong, Claudia. Yeah. Because he got sloppy, didn't he? Right? And we both know why he did that, don't we, Artie? Is Claudia in some kind of trouble with the Secret Service? In the four years that Claudia lived here, did she ever give you any problems? No. Not at all. She was very nice. PETE: Well, what can you tell us about Claudia? I'm not one to gossip, but you might not know she lost her parents when she was just a child, poor thing. Her brother raised her. Then a few years later, he passed, too. Can you believe it? More bad luck than a turtle on its back. She went off to live with a foster family. Well, if you ask me, I think it all just finally hit her. And then six months ago, she checked herself into a psychiatric care clinic. You know about that? Of course you do. You're the government. You probably know what pills I take in the morning. Anyway, she keeps up on her rent. She checked herself out two months ago. Has she contacted you? Well, no, I haven't seen her. She's got a home base somewhere. Did she ever... Did she ever stay with friends? I don't think so. She kept to herself. No boyfriends, no girlfriends. I'm very non-judgmental. Here we are. Thank you, Mrs. Richman. We'll just take a look around. I guess I can trust the Secret Service. Oh, boy. I'm guessing this is the brother. I don't want to sound like a broken record, but what makes you think that Joshua is still alive? Because dead people don't visit, Einstein. He visits you? Yeah. A lot lately. Your brother Joshua visits you and he tells you he's not dead. Yes. Not appreciating the snark, by the way. Rheticus was right, you know, his theories. No. No. No, no. And Joshua was right, too. He was this close to proving it. No. No. Rheticus's experiments were never recreated. Never. He was nuts. Joshua's gone. You're going to be so put down when he gets here. Yeah? Well, you know, I'll take my chances. God. It's about the minerals, Professor. The minerals in the metal. That's what should have made it all work. Sure. You know what I'm sensing here? That this kind of a private chat, it's a brother-sister thing. What do you need me for? (SIGHS) Because I took it as far as I could and now I need you to help me bring him home. You made me a promise. Something's wrong. That's what I've been saying, you fossil. God. (STUTTERS) Something's wrong. I can't... I can't... I can't... I can't... Professor, I'm Joshua Donovan. Joshua. Yeah, I remember this. This is when I met you. We've met before? Yes. No, no. You showed me your experiment. You thought I was here to give you a grant and... That been happening a lot? What? You went back. No. I have the visions, too. We're mad connected, Artie. (CHOKING) The difference between us is I didn't ignore them. (COUGHING) What's wrong? (GASPING) What's the matter with you, Claudia? Usually happens just before. Just before what? You're going to want to sit down for this. He's here. Joshua! What is that? What is happening? CLAUDIA: Joshua! Joshua? Joshua! (PANTING) Told you. What the hell was that? I don't understand what just happened. What's going on? I mean, what the hell was that? That was Joshua. No. Yeah. You saw it, too. I'm not crazy. Yes. Yes, I saw Joshua. How? Because he's not dead. Now, you know it, too. Help me bring him back. Well, I wouldn't know where to start. Well, I've got everything here. The Feldkirch minerals, equipment for an electric field... Claudia, did you try to recreate Joshua's experiment on your own? (CHUCKLES) You're such a creaker. Yeah. Of course I did. The question is, why didn't you? PETE: So far, none of this stuff is telling me where Claudia might have taken Artie. Are you finding anything? For a kid, she seems pretty focused on the 16th century. She's definitely a thinker. Always dangerous. Rheticus. Rheti-who? He was a mathematician and mapmaker student of Copernicus. Yes, Pete, I read books growing up. Right. Why go to the prom? Of course you did. Yeah. Three times in one night. It's a long story. I bet it is. I bet it is. Well, it looks like our girl genius took something with her. Just, you know... Just to clarify, you decided to recreate a clearly dangerous, potentially deadly experiment? Sure, it sounds bad when you say it like that. Claudia, these are very real forces that you're playing with here. And if you stop to think... Chill out, Obi-Wan, okay? I'm trying to save my brother's life here. I really hope that we are trying to save it together. I've spent the last two years of my life trying to figure out what happened to Joshua. And when I reached the end of what I could do, I just kind of, sort of took a peek at your research. You what? You took a peek? You hacked into highly classified government files. Oh, I'm all puckered. You know, imagine my surprise when I discovered that you had done nothing to help him. In 12 years, naught. I thought he was dead. Oops! Wrong. Now you can help. Don't tell me you don't want to. I know you have guilt. Hey! Hey, look at me. I don't. Whatever helps you sleep at night, Professor. Are you all right? I'm fine. Lay off. Yeah. You're fine. Yeah, sure. The nosebleed is what, just for fun? Damn it. I've been jamming for answers. I'm just a little burned out. Yeah. And then I'm just gonna guess that it's getting a little worse. Okay. It's like three to four times a week, now. But it's just stress. I mean, you get stressed, you get the flu. Everybody knows that. It's not the flu, dummy. You're so close to this, you can't see that it is your connection to the experiment that's making you sick. No, please, it's just... It's just... Yeah. Rheticus was attempting human teleportation. So was Joshua. It's beyond dangerous. (SIGHS) Look, it'll be a little easier for me to see what you've got if you take off the cuffs. MYKA: "When love is lost and loss o'ertakes me "The rules of love then are hidden "And chaos rules and order lost "And hidden then my heart from love" Hey. What is that? Nothing. Nothing. It's not important. Hey. A compass. Rheticus claimed he owned it, only no one ever saw it. It says here it probably never existed. It's just folklore. Okay, now, is it just me, or does that sound all artifact-y? Well, you've got the Feldkirch minerals and you're using an electrical field. But what about the rest? The compass disappeared with Joshua. My question is, what are you using instead of the compass? Aren't the minerals enough? Uh-uh. It's the same as the metal in the compass. It's the same thing. No, no, no, no. You can't just replace an artifact with, you know, something else. There's always an X factor. Okay. Which is maybe why I need your help. Which is why you shouldn't have done this at all. I'm shutting you down. No. Hey! Hey! You said you were gonna help me. What I said was, I would look. Which I now have, and believe me, shutting you down, that is helping you. Okay, fine. You know what? Fine. Just do it. Just shut me down. You abandoned him once, why shouldn't you do it again? It isn't like that. No, it's exactly like that. Joshua and me, on our own, again. It's a good thing I'm used to it. I know that it hasn't been easy. (LAUGHS) No. No, it hasn't been easy. He was all I had after our parents died. And then he was gone, too. He spent his fun years sewing Girl Scout patches and teaching me how to fold an omelet. (CRYING) And then, reading Maria Looney on the Red Planet to me every night. He was a genius who put his life on hold for me. None of that's your fault. I opened a door to wherever he is and now he's in pain. You saw his face. That is my fault. Me! I'm the epic fail. Claudia, it is making you sick. I owe him, and so do you, and we're running out of time. Damn it, Artie! Help me save Joshua. (CELL PHONE RINGING) It's a pay phone. What? Lattimer. Pete, how are you? How are you doing? Artie! Artie, hey, man, are you all right? Ask him where he is. Oh, yeah. No. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm just here with an old friend, that's all. Claudia Donovan. (MOUTHING) Very good. You read my lips using the durational spectrometer, didn't you? Where is he? Where... Wait, he probably doesn't know. Right. Right. Artie, do you hear anything? A freeway, machinery... Train whistles. Ask him if he hears any train whistles. Guys. Hey! Hey! Look, the truth is that I'm helping her. All right? You're helping her? He's helping her? You're helping her, Artie? (SIGHS) I figured that you'd be halfway towards finding us, but you can stop now. Did you hear me? You can stop. No, Artie, she's been under observation at a psychiatric facility, all right? Oh, I had no... Poor kid, I didn't know. No. No. Not poor kid. Poor Artie. She's obsessed with you. She's obsessed with the Warehouse, and I'm not letting you stay with her. (CHUCKLES) You're what? You're not letting me? That's really cute, Myka. Cute. Cute. She's cute? Does she have a gun on you? Okay, look. These kids' lives were messed up by... They're in trouble, I can help, that's all you need to know. Well, let us come and help you. No, no! No! No! We have everything we need to make this work. And I'm telling you, I'm fine. But, Artie, wait, wait! Artie, Artie! He hung up. Now let's just get back before Frederic finds out we're gone. Seriously, you know, if Mrs. Frederic can call us, we should be able to call her. Is there a star 69 on this thing? Star 69 wasn't invented when that was made. No. This wasn't invented when this was made. Why doesn't Artie want us to help him, Pete? What's going on? MRS. FREDERIC: Yes. What's going on indeed? Man, I really hate that. I believe I told you to stay put. No, I know. It's just that we were going to... We had to... You know, it would be nice if we could contact you. We had a lead. We decided to follow it. Okay, don't make her angry. What kind of lead? Well, Artie is with Claudia Donovan. Voluntarily. Do you know where they are? It's possible. But we've got bigger fish. You need to get down to the Warehouse floor. Find the San Anselmo grid. On the Locksberg shelf number 1021. Section 405-949-04. Wait. We have a right to know where Artie... Miss Bering. Your right extends exactly as far as I say it does. If Artie is working with Claudia, he may be trying to recreate her brother's experiment. And that's bad? Where do you work? Right. The Rheticus compass. Yes. His experiments were successful. That's why he didn't disappear into thin air. And Joshua did. Yes, something went awry. You have to glean how Joshua went wrong 12 years ago. I still don't understand why you don't tell us... MRS. FREDERIC: What? Tell you where he is? If you run after Artie, governed solely by your affection for him, you won't be helping him. I don't think it's a bad thing to care about Artie. He needs information, not emotion. You go empty-handed, the experiment ends up just as it did before. You're merely two more lost bodies. Thank you. So, what are we looking for on the San Anselmo grid? I'm not certain. But every artifact in this Warehouse is an extension of a person. Understand Rheticus, understand the compass. And for the record, I care a great deal what happens to Artie. Gleaned. Miss Fancy. You're lucky that I have an emergency travel kit in the trunk of my car. Well, "Serendipity" is my stripper name. Okay, so, without the compass, what I'm hoping is that some of these will be able to help us get a much, much stronger electrical charge than what you were able to get using conventional means. Now, to electrify the Feldkirch minerals to a higher frequency. Ben Franklin's lightning rod. I thought his thing was a key. No, no, no, no, everybody fixates on the key. No, no. Please. This is much, much better. Trust me. Well, what about... (EXCLAIMS) That's terrifying. Listen. Heard about the psych ward. I had no idea. I'm sorry. Yeah. Well... Hey. It's his journal. Take a look. Joshua's? Mmm-hmm. See this? That's a rubbing of the edge... PETE: Useless. Useless. Useless. Useless. I'm guessing Artie thought these things were useless. I mean, they're all Rheticus gadgets, but none of them tripped Artie's trigger. Okay, so, Joshua had to follow all these rules to try and make the compass work. Right? The kid even figured out this complicated differential equation. He was a genius. Yeah, and the compass still didn't work. Well, it half worked. Ooh! What is that? It's engraved with the letter T. T? Why not an R? Why T? I don't know what it means. Okay? Look, Artie's notes said that Rheticus's work often expressed a need for order. So, what did Joshua miss? I mean... Maybe he translated something wrong or... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe. What are you doing? Rules and order, right? Right. Okay, well, after spending the last couple of months with someone who also likes those things, you know, crosswords, puzzles... I like puzzles. So? So... So did Rheticus. A secret panel. ARTIE: I'm increasing the power of the electrical field here by about 17 times where you had it. So... You may want to stand back. Yeah. Standing isn't really an option right now. You all right? What? Oh, super. (GASPS) Artie, he's almost here. I know. I feel... I feel... Feels like something familiar. Listen, I know, I know, I know. It's all folklore. (LAUGHING) I know this place. I know this place. Professor, I have found all of the instructions that I need. I have the equation for the electrical field. I have all of these things. Nobody believes that Rheticus succeeded. I mean, it's probably just a bedtime story, Joshua. That's what you think. Joshua doesn't get the concept of being nice to the money guy. Do you want the professor to recommend you for the grant or not? See, Claudia here doesn't get the concept of being ten. Joshua, please don't do this. It's okay, Professor. He may be antisocial, but he's very smart. Knows what he's doing. ARTIE: Does he? See this? This is his compass. I know I can recreate what Rheticus did. It's teleportation, Professor. Please, don't. Hey, trust me. (CLAUDIA GASPING) I started having the dreams two years ago. It's what got me started on all this, because we were both here. Hang in there, kid. This should be a good first run. We'll be able to slow him down with this one. Yeah. I got it. Hold on. Claudia. Claudia! Claudia! Claudia! Claudia. Claudia? Man, this guy was nuts for secret panels. Yeah. And they weren't mentioned in any of Claudia's books. Yeah, and if she didn't know, it's a safe bet that Artie and Joshua didn't know. You see the writing around these edges? Yeah, it's Latin. (CHUCKLES) Oh, let me guess. You speak Latin, too. Okay. Make one more nerd joke, and I'm going to point out how you're losing your hair. Okay? Okay, so, the rules, right? The rules are in Latin, and rules teach us how to use the objects. So, Joshua took them off the compass himself. Yeah, but he was missing something. Rheticus hid some rules. And Joshua never saw them. Nice. And I'm not losing my hair. You don't have it high enough yet, Artie, I'm stuck. No, Joshua! I can help you. No. Claudia's tied to this now. It's killing her. And you. You're tied to this now, too. She's the one I'm worried about. Joshua! Just come back twice more. I can hold you here. I can save you both. No. No. Will you look at her? This place is growing increasingly unstable. It's getting worse. Next time I show up here, it will kill her. Okay, here's... You have to cut the tether. All right? Overload the electrical field. The conductor you're using? The lightning rod. Yeah. Blow it up. Just use that. No, that'll destroy the whole... It'll kill you, Joshua. I know. You can't save us both. To save her you have to kill me. Do it before I'm pulled back here again. So, there's something hidden on the compass. And we think it's the rule that Joshua missed. Nicely done. Now, check this out. In Artie's notes it said that Joshua had everything that he needed for his experiment in his lab. Where it was locked up for 12 years. But before Artie hung up, he said that he had everything that he needed. Bing bang boom. Claudia took Artie to the lab. You took the initiative, and you recognized what needed to be done, all in Artie's absence. I'm pleased. I know, right? Score! Why the test? Is Artie going somewhere? Let's hope not. The directions are in the file. You should get to that lab, and quickly. We don't know how much time we've got left. Do you think she's weird? I think she's weird. She always acts weird. (GASPING) Joshua come and gone already? Yeah. Craptastic. (GROANS) At least we're closer to bringing him back. Okay. You all right? Yeah. No. I'm fine. Listen. Yeah? Thank you. Teleportation is such a powerful weapon, and people want it, Joshua. They're gonna come get it. But I think I finally solved the equation. Listen to me. I could just lay low. It's... Listen to me. Look, the people that... The people that want it, want it now, they're coming after you right now. There's no time left, Joshua. What you have to do is, you have to protect yourself. You have to protect your family. Just give me the compass temporarily. I know exactly where to put it, where it'll be safe. It's... It's in my professor's office. Good. Stay with Claudia until I get back. I'll just be a minute. Thank you, Professor. Sure. Hey, what're you doing? I made a promise to your brother that I'm not going to let anything happen to you. CLAUDIA: What? We're blowing this up. But that'll kill Joshua. Artie, you have to put that back. You have to have the field ready to catch him. No, no, no, no, no. That will kill you, and I don't care if you hate me. I'm not going to let you die, too. I do hate you. I'm never going to forgive you. He's on his way. Good. That's good. What's wrong? Nothing. Yes, something. What? It's just your brother. He should be back by now. That's all. You know what? Why don't we go check on him? Okay? Don't worry. I won't let anything happen to Joshua. I promise. Claudia, I don't have much time before it starts again. I'm sorry. For everything. But I've got to save one of you. Showtime. (GRUNTS) Showtime. (DOOR OPENING) Artie! Joshua! I told you not to do this! I told you not to follow me. Dock our pay. We came here to save you. Is that Claudia Donovan? Yes. Yes. She's just unconscious. What? What? Joshua didn't have all the rules, Artie. Rheticus loved puzzles. And his designs had secret panels. It's inside? It's inside the compass? Yes, in Latin. Where is it, Artie? Where is the compass, Artie? You just have to pop open the panel and find out which rule it is. So, where is it? I don't... I don't... I don't have it. I had to try, Artie. I couldn't give up without trying. Once you said that there was no more time left, I had to prove that I could teleport. No. No. No. No. No. No. No... Artie, what are you doing? I'm doing what Joshua did. No! No! That's how he died. He's not dead. Claudia, I think I can save him. But what I have to do... Don't do this. MYKA: Artie! Artie, make him stop! You promised! Claudia, it's okay. Remember, I will always, always... (SCREAMING) MYKA: Artie, what's happening? It's not over. Joshua! Touch my hand. Joshua! Artie, no! Okay, where the hell are we? Claudia, Artie, you're here. Joshua. Look at you. You... I can't believe you're here. Yeah, I'm here. I'm here. Wait, I'm here? You took me to the inter-dimensional space? You were supposed to get him out, D-bag. No, he was supposed to destroy it. Clearly he's insane. Children, don't fight. Please, I can be both a D-bag and insane. Just where's the compass? CLAUDIA: It's right there. Okay. Rheticus put rules written on objects, sometimes inside objects. A hidden panel, yeah. Yes, yes, yes. In this case, it requires a combination, but they didn't mention a combination. Wait. Letters or numbers? Letters. But there's 20-something letters. How many? Artie? Try T-H-O-M-A-S. Why? Thomas. Rheticus wrote a poem The Loss of Reason about his lost love, somebody named Thomas. Thomas. Yeah, okay. How did I miss that? Latin. Oh, crap! No, no, no, no. It's fine. I can read it. (READING LATIN) It's just directions. Move the dial 90 degrees towards axis. What? I'm no expert, but maybe hang on. Can we touch the... Artie? Are you okay? All right. So... I thought we lost you, buddy. Oh, thanks. Thanks for not giving up. (LAUGHS) Shut up. ARTIE: So, the secret panel thing. I got to say, very nice work. Well, we were motivated, you know. Maybe you should ditch us more often. I'm really sorry about that. If you ever do that again, I'm not finding you, and I quit. Yeah. Just out of curiosity, by the way, how exactly did you figure out the secret panel thing? Well, each artifact is an extension of a person, Artie. We gleaned what we needed from the person. Mmm-hmm. Mrs. Frederic. I thought so. Hey, hey, you know, she's pretty scary, man. If we hadn't found something, she probably would have glared us to death. Yeah. You have no idea. What? It's just... It couldn't have been easy losing someone on the job like that. It wasn't. Well, you know, if you ever want to talk about it... I don't want to talk about it. Okay. Oh. Oh, uh... You know, unless you want to talk about it. I mean... Unless you want... Anytime you want to talk about it is fine, okay? Okay. Okay, bye. Bye. Bye. Hello, Mrs. Frederic. Arthur. (CHUCKLES) An in-person visit. Must have done something right, or wrong. It's a little of both. I had to go back. I know. I was responsible back then. You wanted him to teleport? (SIGHS) I thought he could do it. No, I knew. So I pushed him. And he was lost for 12 years. And you might have prevented it all. And I might have saved Gus, but I didn't. We make mistakes. Some people are lost. We can't save everyone. Something to keep in mind regarding Mr. Lattimer and Miss Bering. That's not why I'm here. Then why? The girl, Claudia. We didn't do a very good job of protecting her, did we? She was determined to find her brother. And in the process, she learned a great deal about the Warehouse, which could become problematic. She wouldn't hurt us. But others might. And... You know what the options are.
