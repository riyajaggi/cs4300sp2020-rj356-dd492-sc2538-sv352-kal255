 ANY MONEY. STOP LYING! NOT EVERYONE KNOWS THAT. IT WAS IN THE NEWSPAPER THIS MORNING. OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH. YOU GUYS EITHER NEED TO BUY SOMETHING OR BE ON YOUR WAY. OH, ALL RIGHT. BUT I'M SO HUNGRY. LET'S GO TAKE BUBBIE'S FOOD OUT OF HER STOMACH. YOU CAN DO THAT?! I DON'T KNOW. PROBABLY. WANT A ROOT-BEER FLOAT, HANDSOME? HUBBA, WHA? MY TREAT. WHOA, WHOA. NO, MA'AM. WELL, CAN I BUY YOU SOME CANDY, LITTLE GUY? YES, MA'AM. HERE'S A QUARTER. HEY! GET AWAY FROM HIM! GET OUT OF HERE! GO ON! WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? I'M PROTECTING US. WHAT? WOMEN ARE TROUBLE. BESIDES, SHE SMELLS LIKE MUENSTER CHEESE. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THOSE WOMEN? THESE AREN'T WOMEN. THEY'RE A PILE OF ROOT-BEER BELLIED, SNAGGLETOOTHED TROUBLEMAKERS. AND THIS ONE... ...DISGUSTING. CANDY WIFE? AAH! UGH. HEY, BUBBIE. GOOD MORNING, DARLING. UH, SWEETIE, COULD YOU GET K'NUCKLES OUT OF BED? HE'S BEEN LAYING AROUND FOR DAYS, AND HE STINKS. I'LL HANDLE IT, BUBBIE. K'NUCKLES? K'NUCK... AAH! STAY AWAY. I'M SAD. WHAT'S WRONG? GET AWAY FROM ME, BOY. I'LL SAVE YOU, CAPTAIN. HEY. DON'T TOUCH ME. I SAID I WAS SAD. YOU JUST NEED SOME SUNSHINE. NO. I JUST WANT TO LIE HERE AND FESTER UNTIL MY BODY MELTS AND GIVES BUBBIE CAVITIES. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, OLD MAN? YOU'VE BEEN A SAGGY, SMELLY SACK FOR DAYS. NOW TELL BUBBIE WHAT ALES YOU. FINE. BACK IN MY NAVY DAYS, THERE WAS THIS PARTY. EVERYONE WAS SMOOCHING. CHARLIE LARAMORE WAS SMOOCHING WITH LILY LONGBOTTOM, PETER PIPPEN WITH LUCY TRUNKS, AND ME SAVORING MY FIRST SMOOCH WITH THE GORGEOUS GERTRUDE GERTER. THEN, LIKE A CRACK OF WIND FROM AN OLD MAN'S BOTTOM... HEY, LOOK. K'NUCKLES IS SMOOCHING WITH HIMSELF. EMBARRASSMENT COMPELLED ME TO SPEAK. W-W-W-WHERE'S GERTRUDE? I'M OVER HERE. I SNUCK AWAY WHEN YOUSE WEREN'T LOOKING, 'CAUSE YOU'RE SO UGLY. HARDY, HARDY, HARDY. OH, MY. THAT IS A SAD TALE, K'NUCKLES. I KNOW IT'S SAD. I DON'T NEED TO HEAR IT FROM YOU. UNH-UNH. DON'T GIVE ME ATTITUDE. I JUST WANT TO HELP. NOW, K'NUCKLES, YOU NEED TO GET BACK ON THE SADDLE. YEAH, RIDE SOME HORSIES. NOT LIKE THAT, CHILD. K'NUCKLES NEEDS TO FIND A GIRLFRIEND. NO. WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW, WO-MAN? K'NUCKLES?! YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT PAIN. SOUL-SHATTERING SUFFERING! GUT-WRENCHING GRIEF! OH, THAT'S ENOUGH, K'NUCKLES. I CAN HATE IF I WANT TO! NOT AS LONG AS YOU UNDER THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH. THEN I'LL HATE SOMEWHERE ELSE! AND I DON'T NEED NO WOMAN TRYING TO CHANGE ME! PBHT! STOP IT, HERMAN. HUH? AND I LOVE YOU. WELL, I HATE YOU. I HATE EVERYBODY. AAH! OH, I LOVE SWIMMING WITH YOU. "I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU." LOVE IS FOR... B-B-B-BEAUTIFUL. HEY, BUBBIE. DON'T THINK I'M LETTING YOU BACK IN IF YOU STILL ALL GRUMPY AND CRAZY. JUST OPEN UP. I NEED TO TALK TO FLAPJACK. NOT WITH THAT ATTITUDE. FLAPJACK, I NEED TO BORROW SOME CLOTHES. WHAT?! I NEED TO LOOK NICE WHEN I GO BACK TO MEET MY LADY FRIEND, AND MY CLOTHES ARE FILTHY. YOU MET A LADY? YES. SO, DO YOU HAVE SOME CLEAN CLOTHES I CAN BORROW? YEAH. I GUESS SO. IS SHE PRETTY, CAP'N? DOES SHE LOOK LIKE BUBBIE? IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS, FLAP. WE'RE ALMOST THERE. SORRY, CAP'N. THERE SHE IS... OVER BY THE WIG STORE. YOU SHOWED UP. I LIKE WHAT YOU DID WITH YOUR HAIR. OKAY, BOY. I WANT YOU TO MEET THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD. EH? UH, ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? I SURE AM. FLAPJACK, UP UNTIL THIS POINT IN MY LIFE, I HAVEN'T HAD ANY REAL DIRECTION. THAT'S WHY I BECAME AN ADVENTURER WITH NO REAL HOME OR SENSE OF PLACE. BUT NOW THAT I'VE FOUND THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I NEED TO BE... RIGHT HERE WITH HER. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I THINK I DO. COME ON, BABY. I'M TAKING YOU OUT ON THE HOTTEST DATE OF YOUR LIFE. I'VE HAD SUCH A WONDERFUL TIME WITH YOU TODAY, BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. MM. LOOK AT THOSE STARS. SOMETIMES I THINK THAT ALL THOSE STARS ARE THE EYEBALLS OF SOME GREAT BEAST THAT LOOKS DOWN UPON US AND THINKS THAT WE ARE BEAUTIFUL, JUST AS WE LOOK INTO HER EYES AND THINK THAT THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL. I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE THAT BEFORE. I MEAN, I JUST FEEL SO LIBERATED AROUND YOU. IF I HAD TOLD THAT TO ANYONE ELSE, THEY'D THINK I WAS NUTS. YOU DON'T THINK I'M NUTS, DO YOU? WELL? DO YOU? STOP MOCKING ME! W-W-WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? W-WE HAD... WE HAD A SPECIAL B-B-BOND. STOP COPYING ME! STOP IT! W-WHAT? WHAT'S HAPPENING? I NEVER SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED A DUMB LADY, NO MATTER HOW BEAUTIFUL. AT LEAST I WON'T HAVE TO HOLD THIS MIRROR ANYMORE. OH, WHO AM I KIDDING? I CAN'T STAY MAD AT YOU. LET'S GET MARRIED. W-W-W-WHAT?! AND DO YOU, K'NUCKLES, TAKE... THAT? I DO. DID THAT MAN JUST MARRY A MIRROR? I BELIEVE SO. YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE. WOULD YOU CARE TO SMOOCH? MWAH! WOW. WHAT A DAY. GOOD NIGHT, WIFE. PHEW. FLAPJACK, BABY, YOU CAN'T KEEP THIS UP. YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RAISING A FAMILY. I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU. OH, PARDON ME, GOOD LADY. WHAT WAS THAT? I WAS LETTING THE GOOD LADY HAVE THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. NO, NO, NO, FLAPJACK. GREAT ADVENTURERS HAVE TO WALK TOUGH, LIKE THIS. YOU, THERE! YOU'RE IN MY WAY! THAT'S CALLED WALKING TOUGH. WOW! OKAY, IT'S MY TURN. YOU, THERE, YOU'RE IN MY WAY. MOVE! WOW! HE MUST BE A SUPER GREAT ADVENTURER. GIVE ME A SHAVE. NOPE. HE'S NO ADVENTURER. YEAH. I THOUGHT HIS TATTOO WAS A LITTLE DESPERATE. NO, FLAPPY. IT'S BECAUSE HE'S GETTING A SHAVE. YOU SEE, WHEN AN ADVENTURER GOES OFF ON AN ADVENTURE, HE SEES SO MANY AMAZING THINGS THAT HIS JAW IS ALWAYS DROPPING, NEVER GIVING HIM TIME TO SHAVE. LIKE THIS? ANYWAY, THAT'S WHY GREAT ADVENTURERS HAVE BEARDS. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? HMM? OH, HELLO, BOYS. I'M THROWING MY ANNUAL BEARD-OFF. THE BEST BEARDS FROM EVERY CHIN CHOWSER, JAW JUNGLE, AND CANDY HOLE ACROSS THE SEVEN SEAS WILL BE HERE TO COMPETE FOR THE GRAND PRIZE... THE HAND OF MY CANDY DAUGHTER. I MEAN, OUR CANDY DAUGHTER. SHE'S OF MARRIAGE AGE AND NEEDS A GOOD MAN. IF SHE'S ANYTHING LIKE HER MOTHER, THE WINNER WILL NEVER HAVE TO BUY CANDY AGAIN. 'CAUSE THEY'LL EAT HER. WOWEE! LOOK AT ALL THOSE BRAVE ADVENTURER SAILORS. YES, SIR. HERE THEY COME FROM ACROSS THE SEVEN SEAS. THE BEARD-WALKING PIRATES OF THE MOLTEN MOUNTAINS. NOW, IMAGINE WALKING A MILE IN THEIR SHOES. THE POOPELLER BROTHERS. LOOK OUT BELOW! AND THE BABY BEARDOS. THEY'RE AS CUTE AS A BABY'S BOTTOM. I WISH I COULD ENTER THE BEARD-OFF. BUT MY CHEEKS ARE LIKE TINY TUSHIES. DON'T LET THOSE AMATEURS GET YOU DOWN, FLAPJACK. SOMEDAY, YOU'LL HAVE A FINE BEARD, MAYBE, BUT PROBABLY NEVER AS FINE AS MINE. WHY, IF THE SUN'S LIGHT EVEN TOUCHED MY GLORIOUS STUBBLE, THE HEAT RAYS WOULD BECOME MAGNIFIED THROUGH MY BEARD'S PERFECT CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE, AND I'D BURN THIS ENTIRE PORT TO CINDERS. THAT'S WHY I WEAR THIS HAT. OH, MY GOODNESS, K'NUCKLES, YOU SHOULD ENTER THE BEARD-OFF. WELL, UH, NAH. I DON'T LIKE CONTESTS. BUT WHY NOT? CONTESTS ARE STUPID. BUT WHAT ABOUT PEPPERMINT LARRY'S DAUGHTER? AN ADVENTURER LIKE ME CAN'T GET TIED DOWN IN A SERIOUS CANDY RELATIONSHIP. BUT WE WERE GONNA EAT HER. NO MORE QUESTIONS! CAP'N K'NUCKLES. HOW WOULD HE WAKE ME UP? AAH! WHAT... WHAT IS IT? OH, IT'S YOU, FLAPJACK. WHAT'S WRONG, BOY? YES. GET ON WITH IT. WHO ARE YOU?! SLIPPERY ABALONE! MY WHISKERS! OH. I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU WITHOUT YOUR WHISKERS. YOUR WHISKERS! THEY'RE FAKE! YES, BOY. MY BEARD'S A FAKE. WHISKERS. YOUR WHISKERS ARE FAKE. RIGHT. WHISKERS. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THIS LIE. NO, NO. DON'T LOOK AT ME. I'M NO LONGER WORTHY OF YOUR ADMIRING EYES. WELL, ME AND THESE ADMIRING EYES AREN'T QUITTING ON YOU AND YOUR BEARDLESS FACE. AND WITH THE COMBINED EFFORTS OF THE FOUR OF US... MM. MM. MM. MMMMM. ...I'M SURE WE'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GROW YOU A BEARD. YOU TRUST ME? DO YOU TRUST ME? I GUESS. ONE BOTTLE OF EEL-OIL WHISKER ELIXIR, PLEASE. OH, K'NUCKLES. THIS MAGIC LIQUID WILL GROW HAIR ALL OVER YOUR FACE. WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, BOY? POUR IT ON ME. AHH. MM. MM. OH, THIS IS NICE. WHAT IS THIS MIRACLE CONCOCTION, FLAPPY? EEL OIL. AAH! FLAPJACK! FLAPJACK, STOP! PLEASE! FLAPJACK! AAH! FLAPJACK! EELS DON'T HAVE HAIR, BOY. EELS DON'T HAVE HAIR. GEEZ. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM ACT LIKE THIS BEFORE. BUT WHAT COULD A TUSHIE FACE LIKE ME EVER DO ABOUT IT? HMM. HMM. GLUE SHOPPE. GLUE SHOPPE HERE. HUH? ♪ HOW TO MAKE A FAKE BEARD OUT OF GLUE AND HAIR ♪ MMMMMM. MM-HMM. MM-HMM. UGH. GUESS I'LL GET ANOTHER BEARDLESS DAY STARTED THE SAME WAY I ALWAYS DO... WITH NO BEARD. I HAVE A BEARD! I HAVE A BEARD! THE ELIXIR WORKED! I CAN GROW A BEARD, AND I CAN GROW IT ON MY FACE. I HOPE I HAVEN'T MISSED THE REGISTRATION. MWAH! YOUR BADGE, SIR. NEXT. WHOA. HA HA. YOUR BADGE, SIR. NEXT. I'D LIKE TO REGISTER MY BEARD AND ME, SINCE WE'RE TOGETHER. TOGETHER? WHY? HAVE YOU EVER BEEN APART? YOUR BADGE, SIR. NEXT. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE PINNING A BEARD-OFF BADGE TO MY CHEST. BUT THEN AGAIN, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE A BEARD. MAN, HOW DO I GET THIS THING PINNED ON? HERE. LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT. THANKS, BEARD. YOU'RE WELCOME, CAP'N. FLAPJACK?! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY BEARD? I'M NOT IN YOUR BEARD. I AM YOUR BEARD. UH, FLAPJACK... HEY, RUFUS. FEEL THAT TRADE WIND COMING IN? YEAH. NOTHING LIKE A LITTLE EXTRA SEA SALT IN MY BEARD. AHH. AHH, YEAH. WHAT IS THIS?! YOUR BEARD DOESN'T CONNECT! IT'S LIKE A... FAKE BEARD! YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO TUSHIE CHEEKS AROUND HERE, DON'T YOU? AAH! EIYEE! I GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS BEARD-OFF. I'D LIKE TO WELCOME EVERYONE TO MY ANNUAL BEARD-OFF. I'D WELCOME YOU TO MY ANNUAL SHIRT-OFF, BUT THAT WOULD SURE BE EMBARRASSING. START THE COMPETITION! THE FIRST ROUND WILL BE QUESTION AND ANSWER. WILL CONTESTANT NUMBER 1 PLEASE COME OUT. HERE'S YOUR QUESTION. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR BEARDS TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE, AND IF SO, HOW HAS YOUR BEARD HELPED OTHER PEOPLE? MY BEARD ONLY HATES PEOPLE, AND IT ONLY GETS IN THE WAY WHEN I'M DRINKING SOUP! CONTESTANT NUMBER 2, GET ON OUT HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THIS, FLAPJACK. YOU CAN DO IT, FRIEND. YOU'RE THE GREATEST ADVENTURER IN STORM-ALONG. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A BEARD TO HELP PEOPLE, AND IF SO, HOW HAS YOUR BEARD HELPED PEOPLE? I, ER, UH, UM... BEARDS ARE BEAUTIFUL. THEY HELP THE WORLD BY BEING BIG, BUSHY FRIEND-MAKERS. AND NOW... THE BEARD BATHING-SUIT CONTEST. HERE'S CANNONBALL CARL SPORTING HIS FABULOUS GOLDEN BIKINI BRAIDS.

WHATCHA GOT? WE'RE IN THE SOUP NOW, KID. NO. K'NUCKLES, YOU ONCE TOLD ME ABOUT A MAN, A MAN WITH A FAKE BEARD THAT WAS SO POWERFUL, HE COULD NEVER REMOVE HIS HAT. BUT IT'S TIME NOW. REMOVE YOUR HAT, K'NUCKLES. FLAPJACK, I... REMOVE YOUR HAT. FLAPPY. REMOVE YOUR HAT. OKAY. OH, YEAH. YOU WERE LYING. FLAPJACK, I'VE LIVED A LIFE OF SHAME, BELIEVING I COULD NEVER GROW AN ADVENTURE BEARD. TURNS OUT, THE GREATEST BEARD AN ADVENTURER COULD ASK FOR WAS RIGHT HERE UNDER MY NOSE. HEY. I THINK SOMEBODY'S GOT A STUPID CONTEST TO WIN. JUST LIKE MY DOG USED TO DANCE. IT'S WORKING, FLAPJACK. GIVE IT MORE POWER. OKAY. HEY, HEY. NOT BAD. THAT BEARD'S AMAZING. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

MY WINNER. THAT'S MY DAUGHTER. I'M CANDY. WAIT. SHE'S NOT MADE OF CANDY? SHE'S ADOPTED. SURE GLAD SOMEONE ELSE GOT THAT PRIZE. AAH! BUT AREN'T YOU SAD THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A BEARD LIKE A REAL ADVENTURER? BOY, I NEVER SAID YOU NEED A BEARD TO BE AN ADVENTURER. BEARDS ARE FOR LADIES. LADIES, HUH? GIG'S UP, GALS. THESE MAN SUITS AREN'T FOOLING NOBODY.
