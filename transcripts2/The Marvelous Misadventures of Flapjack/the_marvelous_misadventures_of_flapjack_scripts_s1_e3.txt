 HEY, FLAPJACK.
 WHERE ARE YOU, BOY?
 OH, THERE YOU ARE, SLEEPING ON
 THE WHALE'S TONGUE.
 I FOUND SOMETHING, BOY.
 I THINK IT'S A MAP TO
 CANDIED ISLAND.
 IT'S GOT AN "X" AND THE WORD
 "TREASURE."
 BUT THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL.
 I NEVER LEARNT TO READ.
 >> Flapjack: I CAN READ.
 >> K'nuckles: I KNEW YOU'D COME
 IN HANDY ONE OF THESE DAYS.
 READ IT, BOY.
 READ IT, AND TOMORROW WE'LL BE
 EATING CANDY.
 >> Flapjack: ALL RIGHT.
 LET'S SEE.
 OH, NO!
 >> K'nuckles: WHAT IS IT,
 FLAPJACK?
 IS IT CANDIED ISLAND?
 >> Flapjack: NO.
 IT'S -- I'M BLIND!
 >> K'nuckles: WHAT?!
 LET ME SEE.
 >> Flapjack: NO! NO!
 I DON'T WANT YOU TO CATCH MY
 BLINDNESS.
 >> K'nuckles: WELL, GEE, KID,
 DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
 WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT WHO'S
 GONNA READ THAT MAP.
 >> Bubbie: WILL YOU TAKE THAT
 BOY TO THE DOCTOR?!
 HE'S BLIND!
 >> K'nuckles: COME ON, FLAPJACK.
 THE DOCTOR WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO.
 UNLESS HE DOESN'T.
 >> Flapjack: IT MUST BE
 DIFFICULT FOR THE DOCKS PEOPLE
 TO SEE A LITTLE BOY SUFFERING
 FROM SUDDEN BLINDNESS.
 DESCRIBE THEIR FACES TO ME,
 FRIEND.
 BE MY EYES.
 >> K'nuckles: UH...
 >> Both: [ SNORING ]
 >> K'nuckles: ...THEY LOOK
 PRETTY SAD.
 >> Flapjack: DON'T WORRY, GENTS.
 IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.
 >> K'nuckles: WELL, WE DON'T
 KNOW THAT UNTIL WE GET TO THE
 DOCTOR, DO WE?
 DOC, DOC.
 WHERE ARE YOU, DOC?
 OH, THERE YOU ARE, OPERATING ON
 THAT PIRATE.
 YOUNG FLAPJACK HERE HAS A TOUCH
 OF BLINDNESS.
 HE THINKS IT'S TEMPORARY.
 [ LAUGHS ]
 >> BLINDNESS, EH?
 MM.
 BETTER FETCH MY EXAMINING TOOL.
 [ WHISTLING ]
 >> K'nuckles: [ MOANS ]
 [ TEETH CHATTERING ]
 >> ALL RIGHT.
 STEP OVER HERE, YOUNG FLAPJACK.
 THAT'S RIGHT.
 RIGHT OVER THE DRAIN.
 NOW REMOVE THE PAPER, PLEASE.
 [ POINK! ]
 WHY, CAPTAIN K'NUCKLES, YOUNG
 FLAPJACK ISN'T BLIND.
 HE JUST NEEDS A HAIRCUT.
 >> Flapjack: HOORAY!
 >> K'nuckles: A HAIRCUT?
 WELL, HOW MUCH DOES THAT COST?
 >> I RECOMMEND THE BARBER NEXT
 DOOR.
 HE'S GOT REASONABLE PRICES AND,
 UH, A HANDSOME MAN, TOO.
 >> K'nuckles: HELLO, BARBER.
 BARBER.
 WHERE ARE YOU, BARBER?
 >> OVER HERE, FELLAS.
 OOP.
 [ WHOOSH! ]
 [ BLINK! BLINK! ]
 >> K'nuckles: ALL RIGHT.
 UP IN THE CHAIR, FLAP.
 THE SOONER WE TRIM THOSE BANGS,
 THE SOONER WE'LL BE EATING
 DELICIOUS CANDY.
 >> DELICIOUS CANDY?
 MMM.
 AND, PRAY, WHY IS THAT, GOOD
 SIR?
 >> Flapjack: BECAUSE WE FOUND A
 MAP TO CANDIED ISLAND.
 SEE?
 >> K'nuckles: [ LAUGHS ]
 IT'S NOT A MAP TO
 CANDIED ISLAND.
 IT'S A MAP TO, UH, UH, UH,
 POISON ISLAND.
 >> POISON ISLAND. HMM.
 NO THANK YOU.
 I-I DON'T LIKE POISON.
 >> K'nuckles: LET'S KEEP THIS
 CANDIED ISLAND MAP BETWEEN YOU
 AND ME, OKAY, FLAPJACK?
 SOME PEOPLE ARE, UH,
 UNTRUSTWORTHY.
 >> Flapjack: CAN WE TRUST HIM TO
 GIVE ME A GOOD HAIRCUT?
 >> CAPTAIN K'NUCKLES.
 WHY DON'T YOU DROP ANCHOR IN
 THIS CHAIR OVER HERE, HMM?
 WHY STAND WHEN YOU COULD SIT?
 THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY.
 >> K'nuckles: YEAH?
 WHAT ELSE DO YOU SAY?
 >> I SAY YOU COULD USE A
 HOT-TOWEL TREATMENT.
 >> K'nuckles: A HOT-TOWEL
 TREATMENT?
 >> FREE OF CHARGE, OF COURSE, OF
 COURSE, UH, FOR BOTH GENTLEMEN.
 YES.
 [ BLINK! BLINK! ]
 [ DING! ]
 [ CLICK! SIZZLE! SIZZLE! ]
 NOW, THIS MAY FEEL A LITTLE HOT
 AT FIRST, LIKE A -- LIKE A HOT
 TOWEL ON YOUR FACE.
 [ HISS! ]
 >> K'nuckles: WOW!
 >> SORRY.
 >> K'nuckles: AHH.
 NOW, THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.
 WHO SAYS THERE'S NO SUCH THING
 AS A FREE LUNCH, HUH, FLAPJACK?
 >> Flapjack: [ Muffled ]
 ADVENTURE.
 >> YOU GENTLEMEN TRY AND RELAX.
 And I'll try not to steal from
 you.
 >> K'nuckles: HEY, FLAPJACK, DID
 YOU SAY SOMETHING?
 >> Flapjack: [ Muffled ]
 ADVENTURE?
 >> Both: [ SNORING ]
 >> [ SQUAWKS ]
 [ FARTS ]
 >> K'nuckles: HUH? HUH?
 HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON?!
 OH, YEAH.
 HOT-TOWEL TREATMENT.
 HEY, FLAP, HOW LONG WE BEEN OUT?
 AND WHERE'S THE BARBER?
 >> Flapjack: HUH?
 >> K'nuckles: AAH!
 >> Flapjack: AAH!
 >> K'nuckles: BUBBIE.
 BUBBIE, SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS
 HAPPENED.
 >> Bubbie: OH, NO!
 FLAPJACK'S STILL BLIND!
 >> K'nuckles: [ GASPS ]
 NO, NO, NO. HE'S FINE.
 JUST NEEDS A HAIRCUT.
 BUT THAT BARBER JUST GAVE US THE
 SLIP, BUT HE TOOK MY MAP!
 >> Bubbie: WELL, I SAW THE
 BARBER TAKE OFF IN HIS OLD-TIMEY
 OLD PADDLE BOAT -- HIM AND HIS
 FLOOR SWEEPERS.
 >> K'nuckles: THEY'RE HEADED FOR
 CANDIED ISLAND!
 [ WHISTLING! ]
 [ WHOOSH! ]
 FULL STEAM AHEAD!
 NOTHING.
 THERE'S NO SIGN OF THAT BARBER,
 AND WE'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR
 HOURS.
 >> Flapjack: BUT IT'S ONLY BEEN
 20 MINUTES.
 >> K'nuckles: I NEVER LEARNED TO
 TELL TIME, NEITHER.
 [ SNIFFLES ]
 I HOPE THE BOY DON'T THINK LESS
 OF ME FOR CRYING.
 >> Flapjack: I DON'T.
 >> K'nuckles: HOW'D YOU KNOW
 WHAT I WAS THINKING?
 >> Flapjack: I CAN HEAR YOUR
 BRAINS.
 I CAN HEAR LOTS OF THINGS
 LATELY.

 IT STARTS LAST NIGHT WITH US
 GOING TO THE CANDY BARREL AND
 YOU EATING ALL THE CANDY AND
 FALLING DOWN AND SAYING THAT I
 WAS YOUR ONLY FRIEND AND
 PROMISING TO TAKE ME ON AN
 EXCITING ADVENTURE.

 ABOUT SPYING -- NEVER TELL
 SOMEONE YOU'RE SPYING ON THAT
 YOU'RE SPYING ON THEM.
 >> Flapjack: WHAT?!
 >> K'nuckles: THAT'S HOW YOU
 CATCH THEM DOING STUFF.
 >> Flapjack: OH.
 >> K'nuckles: SHE'S NOT DOING
 ANYTHING.
 >> Flapjack: GIVE HER A CHANCE.
 IT'S ONLY BEEN ONE MINUTE.
 >> Both: [ SNORING ]
 >> Bubbie: THERE YOU ARE.
 YOU MUST HAVE HAD A LOT OF
 LAUNDRY.
 >> K'nuckles: THAT WAS HORRIBLE.
 SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ALL DAY,
 AND I SAW THE WHOLE THING.

 SHE'LL DO SOMETHING WHEN WE SPY
 ON HER TOMORROW.

 >> K'nuckles: MM-HMM.
 >> Flapjack: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 >> K'nuckles: WAITING FOR MY
 LAUNDRY.
 >> Flapjack: HOW LONG ARE YOU
 GONNA --
 CAPTAIN K'NUCKLES, I'VE PROVED
 BUBBIE'S NOT BORING.
 SEE?
 I KEPT A JOURNAL OF EVERYTHING
 SHE DID -- HER WHOLE WEEK.
 AND AS YOU CAN SEE...
 WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
 BUBBIE? BUBBIE?
 WHY DON'T YOU MOVE?!
 WHY WON'T YOU LOOK AT ME?!
 ARE YOU MAD AT ME?!
 PLEASE, BUBBIE, JUST TELL ME --
 WHAT?!
 >> Bubbie: WHAT'S THE MATTER,
 CHILD?
 OH, WHY, THAT'S MY DECOY,
 SWEETIE.
 I LEAVE IT HERE WHENEVER I GO
 OUT.
 >> Flapjack: OH.
 >> Bubbie: IT IS PRETTY UGLY,
 ISN'T IT?
 FOOLED YOU, THOUGH.
 [ LAUGHS ]
 >> Flapjack: I'LL SAY.
 I SPIED ON YOU ALL WEEK, AND I
 THOUGHT YOU HADN'T MOVED A
 MUSCLE.
 >> Bubbie: FLAPJACK, HAVE YOU
 BEEN PEEPING?
 >> Flapjack: WELL, OF COURSE.
 >> Bubbie: DON'T YOU KNOW THAT
 PEEPING IS WRONG?
 >> Flapjack: THEN WHAT AM I
 SUPPOSED TO DO?!
 SO, APPARENTLY PEEPING MEANS
 SPYING, AND SPYING IS WRONG.
 I SURE LEARNED MY LESSON, LET ME
 TELL YOU.
 >> K'nuckles: AND I LEARNED
 NEVER TO JUDGE A WHALE BY ITS
 BLUBBER.
 >> Flapjack: NOW, WHAT IS THAT
 SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
 >> K'nuckles: I THOUGHT BUBBIE
 WAS BORING.
 BUT ANYONE WHO USES A DECOY IS
 UP TO SOME SNEAKY SHENANIGANS.
 [ POP! ]
 FLAP?
 >> Flapjack: [ LAUGHS ]
 OOH!
 [ WHOOSH! ]
 >> [ SOBBING ]
 >> Flapjack: [ STRAINING ]
 [ CREAK! ]
 >> ALL I DID WAS LOOK AT THAT
 GINGERBREAD WOMAN.
 NO, I DON'T THINK SHE'S AS SWEET
 AS YOU, CANDYWIFE.
 I-I HATE HER!
 [ SOBBING ]
 >> Bubbie: OOH.
 YOU GONNA GET IT NOW,
 PEPPERMINT LARRY.
 >> Flapjack: BUBBIE?
 YOU'RE PEEPING?
 >> Bubbie: IT'S NOT WHAT IT
 LOOKS LIKE, FLAPJACK.
 I'M ONLY DOING IT THIS ONE TIME,
 BECAUSE I WANTED TO WATCH
 PEPPERMINT LARRY, BECAUSE I KNEW
 HIS CANDYWIFE WAS MAD AT HIM,
 AND I KNEW THEY WERE GONNA
 FIGHT AND I REALLY WANTED TO SEE
 THAT MAN --
 >> Flapjack: BUBBIE, YOU SAID
 PEEPING WAS WRONG.
 >> Bubbie: YOU'RE RIGHT,
 FLAPJACK.
 PEEPING IS WRONG.
 AND EVEN THOUGH I ONLY DID IT
 THIS ONE TIME, I PROMISE I'LL
 NEVER PEEP AGAIN.
 >> Flapjack: I PROMISE, TOO.
 >> Bubbie: YOU ALREADY PROMISED.
 >> Flapjack: OH, YEAH.
 WELL, THEN I PROMISE 2.
 [ LAUGHS ]
 HEY, CAP'N, GUESS WHAT BUBBIE
 DID.
 >> K'nuckles: NO.
 >> Flapjack: UM...HOW'S THE
 LAUNDRY?
 >> K'nuckles: STUPID.
 >> Both: [ CHIRPING ]
 >> Flapjack: [ CHIRPING ]
 >> K'nuckles: VERY FUNNY,
 FLAPJACK.
 >> Flapjack: UM...WELL, YOU WANT
 ME TO TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT BUBBIE
 DID?
 >> K'nuckles: IS IT SOMETHING
 SHE DOESN'T WANT ME TO KNOW
 ABOUT?
 >> Flapjack: MM-HMM.
 >> K'nuckles: WELL, HOW ABOUT
 YOU SPIN THAT YARN OVER TO
 CANDY BARREL?
 I'M GETTING TIRED OF WATCHING
 THIS.
 >> All: [ CHIRPING ]
 [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]
 >> K'nuckles: UH,
 PEPPERMINT LARRY, GIVE US TWO --
 >> HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN MY
 CANDY-PROOF VEST ANYWHERE?
 [ CHUCKLES ]
 >> K'nuckles: WHY DO YOU NEED A
 CANDY-PROOF VEST?
 >> JUST A PRECAUTION.
 [ CHUCKLES ]
 [ SLOOP! ]
 [ GULP! ]
 >> K'nuckles: GEE.
 PEPPERMINT LARRY SEEMS A LITTLE
 NERVOUS TODAY, HUH, FLAPJACK?
 >> Flapjack: ALL WILL BE
 REVEALED WHEN I TELL YOU MY
 TALE.
 >> Both: [ GULPING ]
 >> Flapjack: SO, IT ALL STARTED
 WHEN I FOLLOWED BUBBIE UNDER THE
 DOCKS, AND...
 BLAH, BLAH, BLEE, BLAH, BLAH.
 BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLEE, BLEE.
 AND, BOY, WAS CANDYWIFE MAD.
 AND SO...
 BLAH, BLAH, BLEE, BLAH, BLAH.
 WHICH IS EXACTLY THE SAME THING
 SHE TOLD ME NOT TO DO.
 SO I SAID TO HER, "BUBBIE, YOU
 SAID PEEPING WAS WRONG."
 AND YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID,
 K'NUCKLES?
 >> K'nuckles: UH, WHAT?
 >> Flapjack: SHE SAID SHE
 PROMISED TO NEVER PEEP AGAIN!
 BUBBIE?!
 [ CREAK! POP! ]
 [ ZIP! ZIP! ]
 >> Bubbie: OH, HI.
 UH, NO, I-I WAS JUST DOWN HERE
 HOLDING UP THE HARBOR WITH MY...
 FACE.
 >> Flapjack: BUBBIE.
 >> Bubbie: I TRIED TO QUIT
 PEEPING, PUMPKIN, BUT THESE
 PEEPHOLES ARE MY FRIENDS.
 >> Flapjack: THAT'S CRAZY.
 A HOLE CAN'T BE YOUR FRIEND.
 >> K'nuckles: THERE'S ALL KINDS
 OF FRIENDS, BOY.
 [ GULPING ]
 [ RATTLE! RATTLE! ]
 THERE'S ALL KINDS OF FRIENDS.
 >> Bubbie: AND THESE FRIENDS
 TELL ME STORIES.
 THAT ONE TELLS ME THAT
 SLIPPERY PETE HATES MASSAGING.
 BUT I DON'T THINK SHE NOTICES.
 AND ACCORDING TO THIS ONE,
 DR. BARBER SAVES ALL THE HAIR HE
 CUTS AND FEEDS IT TO SOMETHING
 IN HIS BASEMENT.
 >> [ GROWLING ]
 >> Bubbie: HE CAN'T CUT HAIR
 FAST ENOUGH TO PLEASE THAT
 THING.
 [ LAUGHS ]
 OH, BUT THIS PEEPHOLE IS MY
 FAVORITE.
 [ CREAK! SLOOP! ]
 LOOK AT THAT WHALE SPYING ON
 OTHER PEOPLE ALL DAY.
 OH, SO SAD.
 [ SLOOP! SLUMP! ]
 SHE OBVIOUSLY HAS NO LIFE OF HER
 OWN.
 [ SLOOP! SLUMP! ]
 I'M SO LONELY!
 I'M SO LONELY!
 [ SOBBING ]
 YOU TWO HAVE ALL YOUR ADVENTURES
 TOGETHER, AND ALL I HAVE ARE MY
 STUPID PEEPHOLES!
 [ SOBBING ]
 I'M SORRY YOU HAVE TO SEE ME
 THIS WAY, FLAP, BABY.
 [ CREAK! POP! ]
 >> Flapjack: HEY, BUBBIE, YOU
 KNOW WHAT I SEE?
 >> Bubbie: WHAT?
 >> Flapjack: SOMEONE WHOSE REAL
 FRIENDS HAVE LET HER DOWN.
 I'M SORRY, BUBBIE.
 >> Bubbie: OH, BABY.
 >> Flapjack: OH, BUBBIE.
 >> K'nuckles: OH...
 [ GAGS ]
 >> Flapjack: BUBBIE, HOW WOULD
 YOU LIKE TO ACCOMPANY
 CAPTAIN K'NUCKLES AND ME FOR THE
 GREATEST ADVENTURE EVER?
 >> Bubbie: THAT SOUNDS
 WONDERFUL, BABY.
 >> I'M SO GLAD THINGS ARE BACK
 TO NORMAL, MY SWEET CANDYWIFE.
 I WOULD SAY WE SHOULD DRINK A
 TOAST, BUT YOU CAN'T DRINK
 TOAST.
 [ LAUGHS ]
 AHH.
 CANDYWIFE, ARE YOU SURE YOU
 MIXED THE STRAWBERRY JUICE
 CORRECTLY?
 THIS IS KIND OF...STRANGE.
 CANDYWIFE, WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY
 DRINK?
 YOU PUT SOMETHING IN IT, DIDN'T
 YOU?
 PICKLE JUICE!
 [ Sobbing ] I DON'T EVEN LIKE
 PICKLE JUICE.
