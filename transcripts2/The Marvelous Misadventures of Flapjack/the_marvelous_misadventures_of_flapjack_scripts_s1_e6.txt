THE SQUIDSHARK 1700, MY MOTHER'S STATE-OF-THE-ART FLOTSOM DISPOSAL. AND I WAS GONNA STICK MY HAND IN IT! THE TRICKY THING ABOUT OL' SQUIDSHARK WAS I TURNED IT ON BY ACCIDENT. I THOUGHT THERE'D BE CANDY DOWN THERE. I COULDN'T AFFORD A FAKE HAND, BUT A GOOD ADVENTURER LEARNS TO MAKE DO. [ FARTING SOUNDS TO THE TUNE OF "ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT" ] [ FARTING ] THEN ONE DAY I ADVENTURED PAST A PAWNSHOP. IT WAS THE BEST FAKE HAND IN THE WHOLE WORLD. I GOT THE SHOP OWNER'S ATTENTION... >> GO AWAY. >> K'nuckles: LUCKILY I MEMORIZED THE HAND, AND I CARVED AN EXACT REPLICA FOR THE WRONG HAND. BUT LIKE I SAID, ADVENTURERS MAKE DO. THE NEXT HAND WAS JUST LIKE THE ONE AT THE PAWNSHOP.

THERE ISN'T ANYTHING BETTER THAN CAP'N K'NUCKLES' HAND. HIS HAND IS PERFECT. >> Bubbie: JUST LOOKS LIKE A CREAKY, OLD, WOOD HAND TO ME. >> Flapjack: WHAAAAT!? IT'S AN EXACT DUPLICATE OF THE BEST HAND IN THE WHOLE WORLD. >> Bubbie: WHERE DID K'NUCKLES SEE THE "BEST HAND IN THE WORLD"? >> Flapjack: HMM, RIGHT OVER THERE, AT THE "YE OLDE PAWNSHOP." >> Bubbie: WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO ON OVER THERE AND GET THE ORIGINAL HAND? >> Flapjack: BECAUSE -- I DON'T KNOW! I BETTER GO SEE IF THAT OLD HAND'S STILL THERE. THANKS, BUBBIE! >> K'nuckles: I'M GONNA MISS YOU, HAND. [ SNIFFLES ] AW, YOU ALWAYS DID TREAT ME SWEET. IF THIS IS BE OUR LAST DAY TOGETHER, LET'S SPEND IT IN STYLE. [ CROWING ] [ LAUGHING ] YOU KNOW, THIS TIME TOMORROW, MY WRIST WILL FEEL AWFULLY LIGHT. I WISH -- YOU'RE RIGHT.

YOU LIED TO ME, YOU LIAR! >> K'nuckles: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, FLAPJACK? >> Flapjack: I WENT TO THE "YE OLDE PAWNSHOP," AND GUESS WHAT? THE OWNER DOESN'T SELL FAKE HANDS. HE NEVER HAS. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE HE TOLD ME? TALL TALES ARE LIES! >> K'nuckles: BUT I -- >> Flapjack: YOU'RE SUCH A BIG LIAR, IF YOU WERE A TREASURE CHEST, YOU WOULD LIE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN! >> WOW, THAT GUY SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY BIG LIAR. >> Flapjack: YOU'RE SUCH A LIAR, I BET YOU WOULD LIE LIKE A LIGHTHOUSE FULL OF LIONS AND LIMA BEANS. >> K'nuckles: HEY, PIPE DOWN, KID. PEOPLE ARE STARTIN' TO STARE. >> Flapjack: WHAT'S WRONG? YOU DON'T LIKE HAVING ALL "LIES" ON YOU? >> K'nuckles: [ STAMMERING ] >> Flapjack: THIS LIAR LIED ABOUT STEALING THAT HAND! >> THAT THIEF SHOULD GO TO JAIL FOR LIFE. >> HE SURE CROSSED THE LINE WHEN HE STOLE THIS HAT CONCEPT! >> ARGH! HE'S GOT MY NOSE, TOO! >> THOSE TEETH LOOK FAMILIAR! >> OH! THERE'S MY LEG! >> I'VE BEEN LOOKIN' FOR THOSE TATTOOS! >> THERE'S MY DOG, POKEY! >> ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.

I'LL TRADE YOU MY FANCY BACK SCRATCHER FOR HIM. >> Flapjack: WHERE'D YOU GET THAT HAND?! >> HAND? EEEEEW!! THAT PAWNSHOP OWNER TOLD ME IT WAS A BACK SCRATCHER. THAT'S THE MOST REVOLTING THING. >> Flapjack: IT'S JUST LIKE CAPTAIN HANDY'S HAND, BUT THIS ONE SAYS "HANDTHONY"! >> UM, YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S ACTUALLY MY NAME, NOT HANDREW. I KNEW IT STARTED WITH AN "H." THANK YOU, FATBACK. APOLOGIES TO CAPTAIN KICKLES. WELCOME BACK, YOU OLD SO-AND-SO. >> Flapjack: I GUESS THIS MEANS YOU WEREN'T LYING.
