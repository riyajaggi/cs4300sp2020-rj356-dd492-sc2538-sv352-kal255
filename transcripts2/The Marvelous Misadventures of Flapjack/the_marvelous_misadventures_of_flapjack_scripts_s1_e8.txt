YOU HAVE A WOODEN BOTTOM? SITTIN' MUSCLE! ANYWAY, IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO. I WAS LOST AT SEA, FIGHTING A FEROCIOUS SEA MONSTER IN THE MIDDLE OF A BLIZZARD. I WAS RIPPING OFF HIS ARM HAIR WHEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE BEAST STARTED TO SNEEZE. AH-CHOO! THE MONSTER SNEEZED MY SITTIN' MUSCLE CLEAN OFF, AND I NEVER SEEN IT AGAIN, UNTIL TODAY. YOU MEAN...? FLAPJACK, I THINK THE THING IN THAT PICTURE IS MY LONG-LOST SITTIN' MUSCLE, AND I CAN'T GET IT BACK WITHOUT YOU. YOU NEED MY HELP? I NEED YOU TO TALK TO THE WHALE, GET US A RIDE. K'NUCKLES! PLEASE, BUBBIE? OKAY, MUFFIN. YAY! NEXT STOP, THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD! TO LOOK FOR YOUR BOTTOM. SITTIN' MUSCLE. CAP'N K'NUCKLES, WHY WAS THAT SEA MONSTER SHIVERING? BECAUSE HE'S NERVOUS! DOWN HERE, ALL SEA CREATURES ARE NERVOUS... ABOUT RUNNING INTO PEOPLE THEY OWE MONEY TO. K'NUCKLES, ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING? OOH, WHY DON'T YOU CONCENTRATE ON THOSE ICEBERGS UP AHEAD? OH, MY! OH! OOH! OOH, OH. I'M AFRAID THIS IS AS FAR AS I GO, FLAPJACK. THAT'S OKAY, BUBBIE. CAP'N AND I CAN HOP THE ICEBERGS FROM HERE, RIGHT, CAP'N? COME ON, FLAP! MY SITTIN' MUSCLE AWAITS! HA HA! HEE HEE HEE! WAIT FOR ME, CAP'N! HEY, CAP'N! WHAT? WHAT?! FLAPJACK, I CAN'T HEAR... ...ANYTHING FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, OW. CAP'N K'NUCKLES. OH, MY CAP'N, ARE YOU OKAY? I'VE BEEN BETTER, ACTUALLY. AH, I COULD GET USED TO THAT. WHOA! FLAP, WE DID IT! AND WE'RE SO CLOSE! NOW, THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL AN "OBSTACLE" ILLUSION. CAP'N, LOOK, WE'RE HERE. IT SURE LOOKS A LOT BIGGER UP CLOSE, HUH, CAP'N?

OH, WE'RE NEVER GONNA... OOH! HEY, CAP'N. CAP'N, HOW DID YOUR SITTIN' MUSCLE GET ALL THE WAY UP HERE, ANYWAYS? I THOUGHT A MONSTER SNEEZED IT INTO THE OCEAN. WELL, BOY, SINCE WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA DIE UP HERE ANYWAYS, I MAY AS WELL TELL YOU THE TRUTH. I WAS LOST AT SEA, LIKE I SAID, ONLY I WASN'T FIGHTING A SEA MONSTER. I WAS SIGNED ABOARD CAPTAIN RIDICULOUS'S SHIP, THE S.S. DISASTER. WE'D JUST FINISHED MENDING A SAIL... OWIE. OH, MAN, MY ARMS ARE SORE... PROBABLY FROM MY MUSCLES BEING TOO HUGE. MY FIST IS SORE FROM PUNCHING FRANK IN THE NOSE. MY NOSE IS SORE FROM PUNCHING STEVE'S FIST. MY BOTTOM HURTS... FROM SITTING. HUH? THE CREW DIDN'T TAKE TOO KINDLY TO MY CHOICE OF WORDS. HEY, TOSS IT HERE, WILL YA? AND THEY WOULDN'T LET ME JOIN THEM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD. AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, I NEVER SAW MY SITTIN' MUSCLE AGAIN. SO, I GUESS THIS MEANS WE'LL NEVER... HEY, CAP'N, THERE IT IS! IT'S YOUR SITTIN' MUSCLE! NOTICE HOW I DIDN'T SAY "BOTTOM"? FLAPJACK, I'M FREEZING. ME TOO. WE'RE GONNA DIE UP HERE! I GOT AN IDEA. WHAT IS IT? I'M GONNA MAKE A FIRE WITH THESE TWO STICKS. WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA USE FOR WOOD? YOUR WOODEN BOTTOM... SITTIN' MUSCLE. IF I TOLD YOU ONCE, I TOLD YOU 100 TIMES... PLEASE SAVE MY LIFE. WISH ME LUCK. IT'S WORKING. THE STORYTELLER'S CLUB'S NEVER GONNA BELIEVE THIS. YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT TO THE STORYTELLER'S CLUB, BOY, AND I'M NEVER GONNA GET MY SITTIN' MUSCLE BACK I'M GONNA DIE ALONE. YOU'RE NOT ALONE, CAP'N. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BOY? HUGGING YOU GOODBYE. THAT'S NICE, FLAPPY, BUT ADVENTURERS DON'T HUG EACH OTHER GOOD... HUH? I DON'T BELIEVE IT. THE WARMTH OF YOUR HUG IS MELTING THE ICE. HUG HARDER, FLAPJACK! AYE, AYE, CAP'N! IT'S WORKING! AH, COME TO PAPA! HOORAY! HOORAY! HOORAY! HOORAY! WE DID IT, FLAP! WHEE! WE DID IT! HA HA HA HA! WHEE! WHEE! I KNEW YOU HAD A PLAN FOR GETTING US DOWN. OH, WOW. I TOLD YOU IT WAS CHILLY. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I FOUND THIS ON MY SECOND EXPEDITION ON THE SAME MOUNTAIN THAT WE LEFT OUR OLD CABIN BOY'S SITTIN' MUSCLE. I BELIEVE THE LARGER CREATURE TO BE A PRIMITIVE SPECIES, ONE WHO EVOLVED WITHOUT A BOTTOM. SITTIN' MUSCLE. FLAPJACK! YES, BUBBIE? THAT TICKLES! I CAN'T HELP IT! K'NUCKLES PROMISED HE'S GONNA TAKE ME TO THE KNOT FESTIVAL. PRIZE KNOTS FROM ALL OVER THE SEVEN SEAS, KNOTS BETTER THAN ALL OF THESE. YOU KNOW I SHARE YOUR LOVE FOR KNOTS, BUT... WHOA! THE ANGLER'S LOOP. BUT COULD YOU TIE YOUR KNOTS ON THIS STRING INSTEAD OF BUBBIE'S INNARDS? THANK YOU, BUBBIE. HE'S HOME! NO, OH, DARN IT. CAP'N K'NUCKLES. NOT KNOW, KID. OLD K'NUCKIE'S ALL WORN OUT. WHY ARE YOU ALL WORN OUT? HUH? OH, FROM ALL THE KNOT TYING. WHAT KNOT TYING? ALL THE KNOT TYING AT THE KNOT FESTIVAL. WHOO! WORE ME OUT. I'M SO WORN OUT, I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN FINISH THIS. FLAP, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FACE? YOU PROMISED YOU'D TAKE ME! OH, YEAH, WELL, UH, I LIED. K'NUCKLES! LIED ABOUT, UH, THE KNOT TYING. I-I WAS NOT TYING ANYTHING. I WAS SURVEYING THE BEST SPOTS, AND... AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE, RIGHT AFTER THIS NAP. HE'S GONNA TAKE ME AFTER HIS NAP. YEAH, I HEARD HIM, SUGAR CUP. [ BREATHING [ HEAVILY ] WHAT? ARE YOU ASLEEP YET? NO! NOW, QUIT BREATHING SO CLOSE TO ME. I DON'T WANT TO BE SMELLING BOOGERS. SLEEP. SLEEP. GO SIT OVER THERE WHERE YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME! GO ON! WHOOSH! PSHHH! WHOOSH! PSHHH! FLAPJACK! I'M SOOTHING YOU WITH AMBIENT OCEAN SOUNDS. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD. ♪ OH, FALL ASLEEP, MY SWEET K'NUCKIES ♪ ♪ I WON'T SAY A WORD, BUT I'LL SING YOU WORDS SO SWEET, K'NUCKIES ♪ I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS, FLAPJACK, BUT NOW I HAVE TO GIVE YOU THE OLD SAILOR'S CURSE OF MUTE MIKE. WHO'S MUTE MIKE? BACK WHEN I WAS BEAUTIFUL, I USED TO SAIL WITH A SASSY, LOUDMOUTH SAILOR NAMED MAD MIKE. WE WERE LEANING BACK AGAINST THE RAILING OF THE SHIP WHEN A BIG WAVE CAME UP AND KNOCKED MAD MIKE TO THE GROUND. NOW, I STOOD THERE LAUGHING. THE SEA IS PLAYING GAMES WITH YOU, MIKE. I THINK SHE HAS A CRUSH ON YOU. BUT MIKE JUST GOT ANGRY. HE HOPPED UP AND CURSED AT THE SEA FOR PLAYING LOVE GAMES. HE CURSED LOUDER AND LONGER THAN HE'D EVER CURSED BEFORE. THEN THE SKY TURNED BLACK, AND THE SUN TURNED TO THUNDERSTORM, AND THE SEA RAGED. AND MIKE STOOD THERE WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN, WATCHING THE SEA GET ANGRIER AND ANGRIER, UNTIL A MASSIVE WAVE DROPPED 10,000 JELLYFISH IN HIS MOUTH. THE JELLYFISH ZAPPED MIKE'S VOCAL CORDS AND LIPS TOGETHER. MAD MIKE BECAME MUTE MIKE, AND HE NEVER SPOKE AGAIN. AND NOW, FLAPJACK, I GIVE YOU THE CURSE OF MU-U-U-TE MIKE. AAH! UH-OH. NO, NO, WAIT! DON'T TELL BUBBIE. DON'T TELL ME WHAT? K'NUCKLES, DID YOU REALLY CURSE MY BABY? I DON'T KNOW. THAT OLD CURSE NEVER WORKED BEFORE. WELL, UNCURSE HIM RIGHT NOW. I NEVER LEARNED HOW TO UNCURSE SOMEONE. WELL, I NEVER LEARNED HOW TO KEEP MY TEMPER FROM SOMEONE WHO CURSES MY BABIES. HOLD ON. HE'S TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING. WELL, GO ON. SO YOU WANT ME AND YOU TO GO SOMEWHERE. OKAY, SO YOU WANT TO GO TO A FIRST-AID TENT TO FIX YOUR CURSE. WELL, WHERE IS ONE? THE KNOT FESTIVAL, OF COURSE. GOOD THINKING, BOY. GET YOUR RED-HOT KNOTS HERE. IF I REMEMBER RIGHT, IT SHOULD BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. HEY, LOOK, GUYS. IT'S SLIPKNOT. REMEMBER? WE'LL BE AT THE HITCHIN' POST TONIGHT. SEE YOU THERE. NEVER SEEN THOSE WEIRDOS BEFORE IN MY LIFE, FLAPPY, I SWEAR IT. WE'RE HERE, FLAPJACK. DON'T TELL ME, MM. YOU'RE HERE FOR SOME OF MY FIRST AID. NOW, HOW MAY THESE HANDS... BE OF SERVICE TO YOU? IT WASN'T EXACTLY MY FAULT, DOC. I MEAN, I WAS JUST TRYING TO SLEEP. THEN I TOLD HIM A STORY, AN INNOCENT, LITTLE STORY, AND THEN, OUT OF NO PLACE, HE WAS CURSED. IT'S THE CURSE OF MUTE MIKE, DOC.
