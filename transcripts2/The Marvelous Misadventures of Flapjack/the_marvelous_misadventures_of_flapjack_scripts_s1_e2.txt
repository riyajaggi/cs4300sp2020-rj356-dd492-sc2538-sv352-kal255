IT'S MINE. AND, WELL, UH... [ Coughing ] I'M SORRY. [ DING! ] >> Flapjack: DO YOU HAVE ANY WRAPPERS LEFT? >> K'nuckles: YEAH. [ HONK! ] [ SQUEAK! THUD! SQUEAK! THUD! ] >> Flapjack: THINK HE'LL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE? [ BOTH LAUGH ] WELL, WE DIDN'T FIND CANDIED ISLAND, BUT WE DID GET OUR 100 PIECES OF CANDY. >> K'nuckles: I WONDER WHERE THE MAP WILL LEAD HIM. >> Flapjack: OH, WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE TO SEE THE LOOK ON HIS FACE RIGHT NOW. >> AHHHH. I MADE IT! I FINALLY FOUND CANDIED ISLAND. IT'S JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS I IMAGINED IT. BUT NOT AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU, CANDY WIFE. I LOVE YOU, TOO, CANDY WIFE. [ SMOOCHES ] >> SQUAWK! >> WHAT? >> SQUAWK!
