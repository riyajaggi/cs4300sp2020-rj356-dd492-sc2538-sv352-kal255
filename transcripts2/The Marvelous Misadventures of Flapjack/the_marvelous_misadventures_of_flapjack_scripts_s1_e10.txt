 SO, A PIRATE CAPTAIN WALKED IN HERE THE OTHER DAY AND ASKED ME FOR A GUMDROP. I SAY TO HIM, "WHY WOULD YOU WANT GUM THAT'S BEEN DROPPED?" [ LAUGHTER ] "SIR," I SAY, "WOULDN'T YOU RATHER HAVE A CANDY FISH?" HE SAYS, "CANDY FISH? IS IT SWEET?" AND I SAY, "WELL, IT'S SWEDISH." [sweetish] [ LAUGHTER ] SO, NOW THE CAPTAIN IS SO ANGRY, HE MAKES ME WALK THE PLANK. AND I SHOUT, "DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING A LITTLE OVERBOARD?" AND THE PIRATE SAYS, "NO, YOU ARE!" [ LAUGHTER ] BUT BEFORE I JUMP, I ASK HIM, "CAN'T I JUST HAVE ONE LAST MUG OF ROOT BEER?" HE SAYS, "THAT WOULD BE FINE." SO I TAKE THE MUG AND JUMP. AND, YOU KNOW, I WOULD HAVE DROWNED IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR ONE THING -- ROOT BEER FLOATS! [ LAUGHTER ] >> YOU KNOW, LIKE A ROOT-BEER FLOAT. [ LAUGHS ] >> [ Laughing ] A ROOT-BEER FLOAT. ARRR. >> SO, HOW MANY JOKES IS THAT? >> WE NEED ONE MORE. THEN WE CAN MAKE THE TRADE. >> HMM. YOU PUN PIRATES SURE DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN. BUT I AM RUNNING LOW ON CANDY, SO... >> Flapjack: HEY, I GOT ONE, PEPPERMINT LARRY. [ CREAK! ] UM, WHAT DID THE CANDY SAY TO THE OTHER CANDY WHEN THE FIRST CANDY ASKED THE SECOND CANDY IF THE SECOND CANDY WOULD DANCE WITH THE FIRST ONE? "OF COURSE YOU CAN-DY DANCE WITH ME." [ GIGGLES ] [ CREAK! ] >> HEY, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL HERE, PEPPERMINT LARRY? >> [ LAUGHS NERVOUSLY ] JUST PULLING YOUR LEG, FELLAS. I GOT A REAL RIB-TICKLER TO FINISH HER OFF FOR YOU. READY? >> SURE. I GUESS SO. >> WHY IS THIS JOKE AS...SLOW...AS...MOLASSES? 'CAUSE IT'S MO-LASS [my last] JOKE! [ LAUGHTER ] NOW GET OUT OF HERE, YOU RASCALS. >> CHUCKS, BOY, LET'S GET THESE JOKES BACK TO THE SHIP. >> SEE YOU 'ROUND, FELLAS. HOPE YOU HAVE BARRELS OF FUN WITH THAT BARREL OF PUNS. >> WE WILL, PEPPERMINT LAUGHY. HA HA! ARRR! >> FLAPJACK, THAT JOKE YOU TOLD WAS TERRIBLE. WORST JOKE I EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE. >> Flapjack: REALLY? >> YES. >> Flapjack: I HAVE ANOTHER ONE! >> NO-NO-NO-NO-NO. NO. JOKE-TELLING IS HARD. IT'S ONLY FOR SPECIAL PEOPLE WITH A SPECIAL GIFT -- LIKE ME OR PUNSIE McKALE. >> Flapjack: WHO'S PUNSIE McKALE? >> "WHO IS PUNSIE McKALE"?! FLAPJACK, PUNSIE McKALE IS THE FUNNIEST SAILOR IN THE SEVEN SEAS. >> Flapjack: WELL, IS HE FUNNIER THAN YOU? >> IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK. [ CHUCKLES ] TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. I INVITED PUNSIE TO STORM-ALONG HARBOR, AND IN A FEW DAYS, HE AND I WILL BE COMPETING IN THE... STORM-ALONG PUN-OFF! >> Flapjack: WELL, THAT'LL BE VERY EXCITING. YOU KNOW, LIKE A STRAWBERRY. >> MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEAVE, FLAPJACK. >> Flapjack: BUBBIE, WHAT MAKES A PERSON FUNNY? >> Bubbie: OH, I DON'T KNOW, SUGAR. BUT YOU'RE FUNNY. >> Flapjack: REALLY? HOW CAN YOU TELL? >> Bubbie: WELL, 'CAUSE YOU'RE CUDDLY AND CUTE, AND YOU LIKE TO HAVE FUN. >> Flapjack: [ LAUGHS ] >> K'nuckles: STOP IT, WOMAN! NOT YOU, FLAPJACK. "CUTE'S" NOT FUNNY! OUT THERE, "CUTE" GETS YOU KILLED. >> Flapjack: I DON'T WANT TO DIE. I WANT TO TELL JOKES. >> K'nuckles: WELL, I CAN TEACH YOU JOKE-TELLING. THEY DON'T CALL ME "CAPTAIN K'CHUCKLES" FOR NOTHING. NOW, A JOKE IS WHEN YOU MAKE FUN OF SOMEBODY. SO, SAY THERE'S A LADY IN A BIG, RED HAT. >> Flapjack: THERE'S A LADY IN A BIG, RED HAT. >> K'nuckles: REALLY? WHERE? WHERE'S THE LADY? >> Bubbie: [ LAUGHING ] >> K'nuckles: WHERE'S THE LADY? WHERE? >> Bubbie: [ LAUGHING ] OH, FLAPJACK, TELL THAT JOKE AGAIN, BABY. [ SQUEAK! SQUEAK! ] >> Flapjack: THERE'S A LADY IN A BIG, RED HAT. [ GIGGLES ] >> NOBODY DOES HAT JOKES ANYMORE, FLAPJACK. >> Flapjack: WHY NOT? >> I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS THEY'RE JUST OLD HAT... JOKES. [ LAUGHING ] NOW, THERE ARE MANY SPECIES OF HUMOR, FLAPJACK. BUT THE PUN, ALSO KNOWN AS "WORDPLAY" OR "PARONOMASIA," IS THE MOST SOPHISTICATED AND DIFFICULT TO MASTER. ARE YOU READY? [ SQUEAK! SQUEAK! ] THEN WHAT, PRAY TELL, IS THIS? >> Flapjack: LOOKS LIKE ORDINARY TABLE SALT. >> YOU COULD CALL IT ORDINARY, BUT IT MIGHT BE IN-SALT-ED. [insulted] >> Flapjack: DON'T YOU MEAN "IN-SULT-ED"? [ SLOOP! ] OH. WO-O-O-O-W! >> AND WE'VE ONLY JUST BE-PUN.[begun] ONE LAST TIME FROM THE TOP. BE NICE TO THE PIE, OR IT WILL GET... >> Flapjack: DIS-CRUST-ED. [disgusted] >> AND... >> Flapjack: DESSERT US. >> AND THAT WOULD FEEL... [ CLINK! ] >> Flapjack: OFF-PUDDING! [off-putting] >> I AM PROUD OF YOU, FLAPJACK. YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY. >> Flapjack: [ GASPS ] LONG WAY ENOUGH TO HELP YOU BEAT PUNSIE McKALE TOMORROW? >> OH, NO-NO-NO-NO-NO-NO-NO-NO. THOSE PUNS ARE GONNA BE FLYING. I'D HATE TO SEE YOU GET HURT. BUT YOU CAN HELP ME PUT THIS POSTER UP. >> Flapjack: GOLLY! >> YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM FEELING PRETTY SHARP, AND I THINK, BY THIS TIME TOMORROW, OLD PUNSIE McKALE WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT HIM. [ SMACK! ] >> IS THAT SU-POSTER [supposed to] SCARE ME? [ RIM SHOT ] >> [ STAMMERS ] >> Flapjack: PUNSIE McKALE! >> WHAT'S THE MATTER, PEPPERMINT LARRY? CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE? [ MEOW! ] OR ARE YOU CHICKEN? [ CLUCK! ] I'LL MISS THOSE "FOWL" YOLKS [jokes] OF YOURS, BUT I'LL GET ROOSTER [used to] IT. [ RIM SHOT ] [ GOBBLE! GOBBLE! ] WELL, THAT WAS A REAL TURKEY.
