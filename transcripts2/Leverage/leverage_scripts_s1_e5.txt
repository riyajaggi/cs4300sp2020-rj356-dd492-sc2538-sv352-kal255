 Leverage (2008â€“2012): Season 1, Episode 5 - The Bank Shot Job - full transcript 
 Corrupt country county judge Roy was to be robbed of his dirty gains in favor of the victimized families, but while Nate and Sophie are in the bank to get the cash it's clumsily robbed by two amateurs, retired army veteran Derrick Clark and his adolescent son Michael. Nate is shot soon after thinking up impersonating an FBI team, so the trio outside must improvise before the real agents arrive in about 45 minutes.

 Afternoon, Judge Roy. Hey, sweetheart. Help you with anything today, Your Honor? Yeah, Fred. Her phone number. It's Frank. And she's 19, sir. That's too bad. She got a younger sister? Go get 'em, tiger. If there's anything else you need... We'll call your boss. Now, get the hell out of my face. Trick to a one-horse town?

 Being the horse. Oh. That's a little more than we discussed. I trust that won't be a problem. There's no problem, just more money, more risk for me. I may have to adjust my fee. I'm thinking 20 percent. Fifteen. And I won't have you arrested for extortion. Yeah. Well, you know what they say, laundering's a dirty business. No. No more. We got to talk to Nate. No more rip deals. They take too damn long. That's why they're called rip deals. You have to convince them they're getting a deal before you can rip them off. Two weeks. Two weeks sleeping in crappy hotels.

 Two weeks eating in crappy diners. Two weeks having my soul sucked dry. It's 107 degrees. Who lives where it's 107 degrees? Oh, it's not so bad. I kind of like this town. You know, I had to re-task two satellites just to get a lousy Internet connection. Took more than an hour to Torrent the last episode of Doctor Who. Hey, illegal downloading is wrong. How we coming on the breakdown? Fake addresses are shut down. Post office boxes are closed. The phones are cleared. Five more minutes, we never existed. Want me to call the Delgado family, tell them the news? Nah. Soon as I clear county line, I wanna do it. I just wish we could do more than bankrupt that corrupt son of a bitch. What's the matter? We gotta get out of here. I thought that's what we were doing. What's he waiting for? Sir, I'm going to need you to back up from the counter. What for? Just step back, sir. Put your hands up. Easy. Easy. Drop the gun. Drop it. This is a robbery. I don't want to hurt anybody, but we will if you don't do exactly what we say. Everyone away from the door, now. You've gotta be kidding me. Ah, hell no. I knew this went too smooth. Lock the door! Lock it. - You two, out on the floor where we can see you. - Come on! Out from behind the counter. Everyone on the floor! Empty all the tills. Put everything in there. Get out now. Is he talking to us? An unmarked van parked across the street from a bank that's being robbed? Yeah. I think he's talking to us. Well, five more feet and he would have been in the clear. What the hell was he thinking? Don't be an idiot, Hardison. What? Sophie was still in there. It's not enough. Not even close. We're running out of time. What are we going to do? Open the safe. I can't. It's on a timer. It can only be opened certain times of the day. There's no one here who can open it? No. I don't think so. The managers, they have the codes. Damn it! I'm sorry. Everyone empty your pockets. Wallets, purses, watches, everything you got, throw it over here. Not a bad response time. Somebody must have tripped the silent alarm. This is so not good. We've got the money. These guys don't know what they're doing. Maybe I should talk to them. Get them to listen to reason. Yeah, that's a good idea. Get us both shot, huh? I got killers standing in front of me every day in court. These guys ain't them. Yeah. You know what? Maybe you're right. Right here, right here. We need... Oh, oh, oh! I need you to take a step back, sir. Tell me what's going on in there. I'm afraid I can't do that. This is an active crime scene, and you need to... I'm not talking to you. How many are there? Yeah. You're right. Clearly amateurs, these two. Uh-huh. Yeah. The younger one looks like he never handled a gun before. Is Judge Blowhard right next to you? Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, definitely amateur. That's what makes them so dangerous. All right. Two guys, both armed. Neither one a criminal mastermind. Want me in there? Sir, we can't have you going inside the bank as long as... Probably a good idea just to sit tight, don't you think, you know, and see where these guys' heads are at? You know? All right. Your call, boss. Thank you. I know it's almost 5:00. Just go count the money and we'll be fine. Just calm down. What the hell you doing? Get back down on the ground. You know who I am? I don't care. You should. You see, I'm the guy that can make this whole thing go away. All you got to do is walk out the front door. Is that so? Thing is, I'm the law in this town. That fella out there with the badge, that's Bill. He works for me. One phone call, he and his guys will hop back in the car and drive away, no questions asked. Let me talk to you for a minute, son. Stay where you are. How you doing? I'm just peachy. How about you? Something weird is going on in here. You noticed that, too, huh? You hear what the guy said, they didn't have enough. They need more cash and it's not to pay rent. I don't care what it's for. Let's just focus on getting out of here. We help these guys get what they want, then we can get everybody out of here safely without anyone getting hurt. I don't know about you, but I am not going to leave my fate in the hands of the Juan volunteer SWAT team. Okay. So, what's the plan, Stan? The truth will come out. The truth? The truth is what I say it is. Whatever story I make up about what happened in here, these little people will tell the cops. Oh, yeah, son. That's how it works in this town. All you got to do is walk out that front door. It's that easy. Thanks, boss. But I've been around long enough to know that things that sound easy hardly ever are. Now, sit your ass back down. We cannot allow the local Leos to handle the situation. We have to get in charge of it. We have to be the police. Well, how did that go for you there, Judge? Nice ride. It's embarrassing. Everyone knows you don't rob a bank without an exit strategy. These two deserve to get caught. Forty-two seconds. What? To rob this bank. One security guard who's never fired his gun before, two closed-circuit cameras outside, one inside, and a Glenn-Reader safe built in the '50s, whose default combination is the birth date of the manager's wife. Get in, get out, 42 seconds. Seriously? I'm Agent Leonard. This is Agent Elmore. We'll be taking over this crime scene, Sheriff... Bill Hastings. Nice to meet you. I know. You guys sure are quick. Just called this in 20 minutes ago. Well, we were coming back from a little border skirmish. Patrol unit came under attack from a pack of Chupacabras. Chupacabra? I thought those things were urban legend. You're adorable. So, what you got, Sheriff? Well, I can't really get a good look inside, so we don't know how many gunmen there are or how many hostages they have or what they want. Hmm. What about your tactical insertion team? We don't have a SWAT team per se, but old Virgil up there, he's a hell of a crack shot. Great. Better make sure our under the table money stays under the table. If the Feds find that, we're screwed. We're still short. We gotta get into that vault. Where's the manager? Um, sir? I'm the branch manager. Hey... If she wants to hang herself, let her. I might be able to override the vault's timer. I could try if you want. Okay. What the hell are these guys up to? You got me. All my years on the bench I never seen bank robbers try to add to their haul after the place was surrounded. Usually their minds are on getting the hell out of Dodge. What would help... You listening? What would help is if we had some kind of background on these people, you know, so we could know how to sort of deal with them, right here, right now. Already working on it. I've hacked into the bank's security system. I've got a good look at your gunmen. I'm running them through my facial recognition database. Tapped into NSA, FBI. If these guys have records, we should get something pretty quick. Oh, that was fast. These guys must have warrants. Check that. The older guy is US military, Derrick Clark. Served as an officer in the Navy for 20 years, retired last spring. Well, it doesn't make sense... It doesn't make sense. You know, why would a guy like that rob a bank? I'm accessing his financials. It looks like Derrick cleared out all his accounts this morning, even visited a bunch of ATMs around town, hitting the daily withdrawal limit on all his credit cards. Yeah, but who takes all their money out of a bank and then comes back later only to rob it? You say something? I... What? Oh, no. I was just... I was thinking about... You know, if the cops were smart about this, they would ID these guys, kind of figure out who they are and maybe get to their family members. Two steps ahead of you. Hardison just texted me the address. I'm on my way there right now. What the hell? You know how hot it's going to get in here? What the hell? What's going on? Whoa, what's going on? Cut power to the bank. Standard operating procedure. Standard? It's standard op... It's standard... Where are you getting that bull-hockey from, son? Deputy Arnold here. Took a seminar in crisis management last year. It was an online seminar. We got certificates. Certificates? Magic kits come with certificates. Does that make it cool for kids to saw their parents in half? I was just going by the book. The book? The book got a good man killed. I can't. My blood pressure... Ex-partner. Probably shouldn't mention the book again. Or propellers. Why are you doing this? Don't have a choice. We need the money. For what? Your son in some kind of trouble? He is your son, right? It's none of your damn business. Well, seeing how you have a gun pointed at me, I kind of feel like it is. You don't know the combination, do you? Are you even the branch manager? Um, not exactly. Okay, Derrick. Listen up. It's like this. I just want to help you, you and your son. How do you know my name? I know a lot of things. I know you don't want to hurt anyone. And I know you wouldn't be doing this if you didn't have to. So just... Just try and help me understand, huh? What's the money for? Hello? No. I'm working on it. It'll be there. Yes, all of it. Look, just, please, don't hurt her. Just... Hello? The house has been broken into. Someone was here when it happened. His name is Michael. Found his report card on the floor. What are you doing? Get back on the ground. It's not too late, Michael. That's right. You can still save her. Do you know who took her? It's all my fault. They think I did it. They left a note that said that they wanted 100 grand by 5:00, or they'd kill her. Well, we're not going to let that happen, okay? But you have to trust me, and you have to do exactly what I say. And I promise you, we will get your mom back. They had me doing little things at first. You know, errands, stuff like that. And then a few months back I started running for them. Mmm-hmm. Drugs? Meth. Mostly. I mean I just... I got caught up, you know. Michael, why are they coming after you now? Well, last week they got ripped off. An entire shipment, it was... It was just gone. And they think... They think I did it, but I had nothing to do with it. Right. So, they broke into your place, they didn't find it, so they took your mom as collateral. They said I can return the shipment or pay 100 grand. I mean, that's 100 grand. My dad and I don't have that kind of money. This is all my fault. Everybody shut the hell up... You just got to listen to me. Listen, I know what you're going through, and I can help you, if you let me. How? I mean, you're trapped in here same as us. Mmm-hmm. I got people on the outside. No. No cops. If they find out we contacted the police, they'd kill her. They're not cops, I promise you. They're friends of mine. You can trust them. Why should I trust you? I don't know who you are. I'm a thief. Okay. I'm not sure what to do with that. That creep over there, Judge Roy, amongst other things, he's been taking bribes from meth dealers and smugglers. Two months ago, he cut a man loose who killed a local girl. Delgado, right? Beth Delgado. I remember that. She was a good kid. She went to school with my son. We're running a scam on the judge. We're stealing all his dirty money and giving it to the family. Listen, I have one partner inside the bank and three more outside. I can't trust... You're thieves. And we're your only chance. Police have this place surrounded. You're not going anywhere. My people are the only ones who can make the drop. But how are they going to do that? The deadline's in half an hour. Your friends just happen to have $100,000 lying around? We're going to use the money that we have in here. It's not enough. We're still short 30 grand. No, Michael, no. Not that money. We have an alternate revenue source. Is he suggesting what I think he's suggesting? Are you suggesting what we think you're suggesting? You want to give our bad guy's money to some other bad guys? Yes. That's exactly what I'm suggesting we do, but we're going to do it without blowing our covers, gang. Who are you talking to? Maybe I'm just dense, Nate, but your alternate revenue source is sitting two feet from Boss Hog himself in the middle of a bank surrounded by a bunch of cops. I didn't say it was going to be easy, but nothing's impossible, especially when you have the world's greatest thief on your payroll. Parker, have you ever robbed a bank that's being robbed? There's a first time for everything. Bank was built prior to 1980, before computers. Means it's got a larger than normal night-deposit chute. Because business owners had to drop off ledgers with their daily hauls. What, you thought my genius was only limited to ones and zeros? I'm thinking the chute's my way in. Only problem is, it's in the alley on this side of the building. You'll be visible to the cops out front. I can take care of that, but we actually have bigger problems. What's that? Sheriff Coltrane over here called the FBI, the real FBI. Now, the closest office is in San Diego, so they should be here in about 45 minutes. We can't worry about that now. When do we worry about it? In about 45 minutes. What's going on? In 45 minutes, 45 minutes. We need to stall for 45 minutes. Piece of cake. Plenty of time. I'm not worried. No more talking. No more trying to convince us you can help. We're in charge. We talk, you listen. That's the way it works. Get away from him. Everybody up against the desks. Come on! Let's go! You heard him! Move it! Thanks for trying. Now, everybody sit down and shut up! So we used, uh, baling wire. Like a 20-pound... Excuse me. Agent Leonard. Yeah. Yeah. What? Yeah... Yeah, you know, we will do whatever you need us to do, just, please, don't hurt anybody. Okay. Guys, boys, boys, come on. Gather round. Now, boys, that was the call. The call we were waiting for. Now, look, they have a list of demands. First off, they want 12 large pizzas, one cheese, one Hawaiian, extra pineapple, two pepperoni black olives, two meat lovers... Seriously? Nobody's writing this down? Seriously? One triple shot half-caf vanilla latte, tall. Three of the latest copies of the Hall and Oates CD. Oh, yeah. I know, right? Exciting stuff. I didn't know they were coming out with a new one either. We're gonna need some steaks. Steaks and a grill. They're trying to tailgate, okay? They need your overalls, I don't know why. They need some Kibbles 'n Bits. We need an Etch A Sketch. Somebody in there likes to squiggle, okay? Possibly we need some stuffed bears. Are we good? Let's go, people. Everybody. I need you guys moving. Everybody get out, go. You stay. We need to talk about Hall and Oates. We have to trust them. They're criminals. But then again... What'd you say to him? Oh, well, you know, I was just trying to divide and conquer a little bit, play the kid, get them to turn on each other. It was starting to work, too, but I don't know. Hi. There's a lot of money in there. Yeah, I know. My wife's life depends on that money getting where it needs to go. I understand. Sometimes bad guys are the only good guys you get. Listen, kid. You obviously got yourself in some trouble here. Why don't you let me help you out? Uh, Judge, I think they were serious when they said, "No talking." So maybe we should just stay here, not talk and do what they ask. It's better that way. Okay. Just hear me out. You need money, right? Money I got. Ain't no reason you and I can't come to some sort of arrangement. It'd be a loan, of course. Stop! Oh, oh. Where are you going? I'm just showing you my word is good. Now, how much do you need? Because I've got quite... What the hell? Where's my briefcase? It's them. What do I do? Judge? Nate! Oh, my God! Nate! - Drop the gun. - It's okay. You first. Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me. Whoa, whoa! Hold up. Hold up. Whoa, wait a minute, man. There could be people hurt in there. We don't know that. It was just one shot. Now, look. We all go in there guns blazing, there will be more shots and people will get hurt. We need to know what happened. Just please, everybody just calm down. Just put the guns down. We can talk this thing through. I'm not taking orders from you, missy. What is your problem? My problem? You're my problem. You and Nate there. Oh, yeah, I heard what you called him, Nate. Which is weird, 'cause when we met he told me his name was Carl. You guys are trying to rip me off. And you're in on it with these two. We have nothing to do with these people. No, no, no, no. No, I see what's going on here. The four of you are conspiring against me. This bank robbery, it's not even real, is it? It's just one big scam to try to get my money! Actually, it's not a bad plan. I mean, if old Carl here just disappeared with the cash, he knew I'd come after him. Eventually, I'd track him down. But if the money was stolen in a bank robbery, well, heck, you might get away with that. You're wrong. They were just trying to help us. My wife, she was taken. We need the money for ransom. Ransom? Really? Is that the best you can do? You'd have to be an idiot to fall for a cockamamie story like that. He's telling you the truth. Oh, shut up! All of you shut up! Now hand over that gun before I get it into my head to shoot all four of you. Now, please, he needs to get to a hospital. That ain't going to happen. No one gets out of here until I get my money. Where is my damn briefcase? It's not here. Well, I can see that. No. I mean, it's not in the building. Come on. Come on. They haven't arrived yet? Yeah. 'Cause meth heads are so punctual. You don't come in to my town and think you can get away with my money. A man has been shot, sir. You have to let him go. I said nobody leaves. He's bleeding. Oh, shut up, everybody, shut up! I'm trying to think. If you got the briefcase out of the bank, that means you must have a man on the outside. How are you communicating with him? And then I BASE jumped off the building onto the roof of an armored truck and took out the guard. You mean the gunman? Yeah. That's what I said. Gunshot was accidental misfire. No one was hurt, but one of the hostages was grazed. They're going to release him as soon as their demands are met. Where the hell are those pizzas, anyway? Come on. Oh, this is bad. You get your guys when I get my money. This is really bad. Now, back off. Is that what I thought it was? I'm afraid so. Nate looks pretty messed up, man. We're going to need that briefcase back. I'm working on it. Do you mind? Do you mind? I think it went through and through. Well, it missed your artery. At least there's that. Things could be worse. Worse than me getting shot and you blowing our cover? No, no, no. You're not going to lay that crap on me. We wouldn't even be in this mess if you'd just walked out with the cash when you had the chance. I would've been fine. I know. Yeah. I can take care of myself. I know. I've been doing it a long time. I know. Since way before I met you. I know. I'm just saying. Okay, got it. Okay. Yeah. So? What's the plan? The plan? You mean the one that involves carving a half-inch hole in my shoulder, that plan? No, I threw that one out a long time ago. It doesn't matter now anyway. We lost communications. Yeah, we did. Hardison, Parker and Eliot. That's right, they're on their own. On their own. Yeah. Yeah. Yup. There's more than we asked for. Well, ain't that punk just full of surprises? Where the hell you think you're going, old lady? Where the hell you think you're going? Hey. What smells like crank and screams like a girl? That's the right answer. Come on. Stay in the car. Who are you? Well, ma'am, we'd be the cavalry. Ready yet? Just a few more minutes. Hurry up. The pizza's here. Just let the paramedics take him. The rest of us will stay. And give up my leverage? Hey, listen. She's going to be all right. Everything's going to be all right. Your people, they're good? Yeah. The best. This is all my fault. I never should have got involved with those guys. I mean, if something... If something happens to Mom... Dad, I'm really, really sorry. This is agent Leonard with the FBI. We have those pizzas you ordered. Uh, we didn't order any. You're going to want to answer that, Judge. Uh, Old Scout, get over here and unlock that door. Come on. I was told you were expecting this. Now, is there anything else that we can get you? Anything at all that would help this end peacefully? Oh, no. Wait. Wait. I'm not... No. Sir, sir, now we brought what you asked for. If you just let the hostages go, you and me, we can talk this thing out. You don't understand. You see, it's those four. Now, now, now. Look here, bro. Okay, I understand this seems like a hopeless situation right now. What are you doing? But nobody else needs to get hurt. You, you, you... You're one of them, aren't you? Now! Move, move! Put the gun down, Your Honor. Bill, this is not what it looks like. I said drop the gun, slowly. No, no, no. You guys have got this all wrong. I'm the hero here. I'm the one that... What are you doing? You work for me? You all right? Let me help you up. You know, Roy, if you needed money, you could have come to me for a loan. I don't need a loan. I got plenty of money. What'd you do with the pizza? Where's that pizza box? Do you understand what he's saying? 'Cause he's not making any sense. This is my money. They got my money again. What the hell are you talking about? It was in my briefcase. This briefcase? Crystal meth? My God, Roy, what have you gotten yourself into? Oh, I don't... That's not mine. This is all starting to make sense now. It would explain the irrational behavior, the nervousness, the irritability. Shut up. You're not even real FBI. The paranoid delusions, the violent outbursts. Listen to me, he's one of them. He's in on it. In on what? With who? With her. And these two over here. Hey, hey, hey. These two. Easy, easy. People, step back, please. Ready? All set. Well, it's about time. We're gonna need your clothes. Now. Michael. Mom. Yeah, it's all very heartwarming, but can we save it for after the morphine drip? Sorry. It's exactly what happened. He just went berserk, like he was off his meds or something. He was waving his gun around. You ever seen Dog Day Afternoon? Write that down. I guess Carl thought he could talk some sense into him, but Judge Roy just kept telling him to shut up. He was just trying to be the hero. But Roy wasn't having it. He shot him where he stood, cold. Well, that's ridiculous. That guy wasn't even here. Fred, Fred, come. Tell them. Tell them the truth. First of all, it's Frank. And it happened exactly how they said. Way to go, Frank. They're lying. They're all lying. If you don't believe me, you just look at the tapes. Good idea. Pretty damning stuff, Roy. Got you on the TV and everything. Clearly they doctored it somehow, you idiot. He needs to get to a hospital. That ain't going to happen until I get my money. Doctor might not be a bad idea. Come on, Bill. You know me. Yeah, I do, Roy. That's kind of the problem. Hey, whoa, Bill. Listen to me. These people, they're trying to set me up. They had this planned from the start. You're still a geek. They're trying to ruin me! Geek power, baby. Stay strong. That was a real brave thing you did, kid, stepping into a situation like that totally defenseless. Tell me something, all you FBI guys got cojones that big? Y'all take care. We have another team coming in to do the wrap-up. All right, folks. Let's go. Let's move it along. Let's go. Do you have any idea... Just go with it. Uh, Mr. FBI guys, can you help me here? All right. My, my. Look at this. Our local drug boys, both with outstanding warrants. That's incredible. Damn, we're good. Hey, thanks, Parker. Whatever. No. It was an excellent performance. Yeah. I think I can act okay when I'm yelling at people and bossing them around. Well, it's a good start. Listen, we have to make sure we get the cash to the Delgado family. Ow! Oh. Settle down. You act like you've never been shot before. So, pizza boxes, huh? Yeah. I know, I know. You could've done better. No, no, no. No, I couldn't have.
