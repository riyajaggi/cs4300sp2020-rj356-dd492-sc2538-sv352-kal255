 Anything. I'll do anything. Okay. What I'm asking for you to do is... Answer this phone. What are you supposed to do when they call you? I do whatever they ask. Then destroy the phone and tell no one, Or they'll kill my children. You, uh, install and repair telephone lines for a living? For 10 years. I have three major contracts right now. If I'm arrested, it all goes away. And you have no idea why they specifically targeted you? No.

 I'm not perfect, but I try to be a good man. My parents came to Boston To get away from this kind of thing... Russians hurting Russians. And if you contacted the police? The Russians will know. They say they're watching. This bar, I've been here before. It's probably safe. And you... You're no cop. No. I'm no cop. [ beeping ] Cloned. This phone rings, I want you to answer it. We'll contact you. Thank you, Mr. Ford. We're not gonna let anything bad happen to your family. Thank you. Okay, now, I put a tap on the phone, So if that thing rings, we'll know it. All right, good. What else? There's one incoming call. These guys were thorough. They wanted to make sure if they called, Andrei would answer. Yeah, they, uh, they call it once to test it. Exactly. So if we just call...Them...Back... [ cellphone rings ] You going to get that? [ ringing continues ] This is Pieter. Hello? Marco. Polo. You sure this is the place? I'm sorry, am... am I... am I sure? Eliot, what is that Russian carrying? It's called a smartphone, okay? Smartphones read e-mails, they have GPS maps, They link to an atomic clock On this little thing called the Internet. You ever heard of it? Come on, man. Look, a smartphone has an operating system. If it has an operating system, you know I can hack it. [ beeping ] [ chuckles ] Okay. Think I may have just I.D.'d our bad guy. His name is Pieter Volokh. Him and his crew, they used to belong to the m-45s, Ex-military hitters turned mafia boys. Now, they took a big hit in a bust last month. [ whistles ] They lost $20 million in merchandise to the police. That's gotta hurt. Okay, so... so now look. We know what they're after. They're looking for a big-payout job So that they can get back on their feet. Now, I've I.D.'d the perp, I know what they want, and I know why. What did you do with your afternoon? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do when I get back there. [ machine shuffling ] [ shuffling continues ] Think he's involved? It's Russian mafia. They wear their tattoos like a rÃ©sumÃ©. See that cathedral on his neck? Three spires, three tours in prison. The stars on his arm means he's a Captain. So he's the boss? I don't know. Probably. I ran into some of these cats in Petrozavodsk. They blackmail innocent people like Andrei Into committing crimes and dropping off money. Then those guys get picked up by the cops Or they end up dead. It's brutal. Want me to taser him? Nate: No tasering, Parker. Not yet, anyway. Are they still in sight? I hate this kind of criminal. What exactly were you doing when I chased you? I stole art from rich people who could afford it. These guys? They terrorize their victims, They harm families, and the worst part? They make innocent people commit crimes. Oh, that's the worst part? [ scoffs ] You blackmail an innocent man into breaking the law, The rest of his life he's gonna feel shame Over how you made him helpless, Or guilt over what you made him do. We chose crime. Andrei didn't. Hurry up! I hurried! Then I hurried again! I checked it three times. It's clean. Check it again. [ metal creaks ] [ beeping ] Hey! What are you doing? Sh... Well... Uh... Eliot! Mnh! Mnhhh! [ crowbar clatters ] Uhh! You don't throw crowbars at people! Sorry! "you don't throw crowbars at people!" Could have just tasered him. Promise me we're gonna take these guys down hard. I promise. Where are they going? I want this to be exciting and dramatic. Well, it's already exciting. Look where they stopped. They reversed the phone tap. We're blown. They're gonna kill Hardison. They're gonna kill who? No, they ain't! I bet you they ain't! Nate, you better stall! Yeah, come on. [ both grunting ] Whoa. Wait... wait a minute. Look, my only way out is the front door. Are they coming through the front door? I don't know. What you mean you don't know? You better say something. I swear on my mama, I will blow a hole through your bedroom And spider-man out the side of this building. Tell me something. We'll tell you something in a second, Hardison. We're coming through the back door. Shh. What? You're not gonna like this. What? Somebody's been eating our porridge. You don't have to be so rough with him. This guy... Hardison: Nate? Hold on, Hardison. They're not here for you. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I knew it. [ chuckles ] Nobody can reverse my phone taps. Come on, man. I don't see why y'all were getting all excited. All right, I'll do whatever you say. I still have the phone! What else do you want from me? The red phone again. Nate, this guy's not our boss. He's another blackmail victim. Nate: Yes, I know. I'm about to meet their boss. Go on. Hello, dad. Nathan. Give me a moment. I want a word with my son. Go on. I got out a while ago. Yeah, I-I know. I knew you were out. I didn't see you at the prison gates Waiting to pick me up. Yeah, I was, uh, visiting mom's grave. So, uh, what's... what's a washed-up bookie like yourself Doing with a Russian blackmailing crew? I went to prison 'cause I took the fall For the three families. I did my time for them like a stand-up guy. You heard what happened. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was on the news. Yeah, I heard what happened. Artie van, he turned state's evidence. Turned state's evidence... Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Gave up his ledger. 20 years of payoffs... The McTeagues, the o'hares, the donnellys... All the big families are going down by law. Now, once upon a time, They would take care of someone Who's gone inside for them. I went to jail for nothing. I want to get my piece. With these guys? These guys that... that threaten children? What? Geez, you always thought you were smarter than me, Brighter, better than me. Everybody in the neighborhood always treated me with respect, But my own son... what did you do to respect, exactly? My son, my altar-boy son. Well, hey, listen to you. Never broke the law, you never broke a rule. Look at you now. You're a thief. You've done time. If you know where I've been, Then you know that this is my town now. And I don't want you running game in it. All your life you thought you were better than me. Now you're trying to be me? You can't be me. You don't have the stones for that. You're not tough enough. You're not ruthless enough. You don't have what it takes. You remember the first time I brought you into my office? Queen and her court. Got that? Watching? Keep your eye on this. It's the lady. Now, pay attention. Which one? You still don't get it, do you? You got to think this through, kid. You're just never gonna get it. You weren't good enough to know what I was doing then And you ain't good enough to know what I'm doing now. By the way, I'm setting up, uh, In my old workshop in the back there. I'll be out by this weekend, so don't worry about it. Okay. Run it. Ahh. Go ahead. Run it. You... you know what? Maybe we should just discuss first. They feel weird going after your dad. Well, I don't. Come on. Run it. Jimmy Ford. Hardison, tell us about Jimmy Ford. All right. [ beeping ] Uh [clears throat] Jimmy. Jimmy, Jimmy Ford. Jimmy... your pop. He... he wore a lot of criminal hats, man. But, uh, he was, well-known in the neighborhood. I think people liked him. He, uh, helped some people get some money. Forget it. No, no. Come on, you can't sugarcoat it. Come on. It's all right. It's all right. All right. You got to tell it like it is, all right? Jimmy Ford... he was, uh... He started off as a bookie Who worked for the McTeagues, all right? He ran every bet this side of Atlantic city. Once he had a fair amount of honest citizens in his debt, Well, he made the transition into being a loan shark. Now, he used those contacts to become a fixer. So what he'd do is he'd take a bad guy that needed a job And a boss who needed a henchman, match them together. That... that's Jimmy Ford at his peak. King of the neighborhood. Sophie: I don't know how this ties in With the whole cellphone/blackmail thing. Well, we've got multiple victims. There's Andrei, the telephone repair guy. Then there's Eliot's friend Simakov. What does he do? Hardison: Shipping. Industrial clothing, uniforms. Nothing remarkable. Then, following Pieter's phone, We found a third red phone. Eliot: That's a dead end. We don't know who this guy is or what he does Or why the Russians want him. And he's not gonna talk to us 'cause Pieter's boys already put the fear of God in him. What is Jimmy's game? Well, I would imagine He has a chess board set up in the back room. Looks a lot like yours. No, dad doesn't like chess. No, his game is three-card Monte. Just keep the cards moving. Don't show you the queen until he wants you to see the queen. All right, so, we don't have enough information To run a con on this guy. Not yet, anyway. So, um, why don't we just sit this one out? Oh, no, no. No, no, we're gonna keep at this. We're gonna gather information. Let me be a bit clearer... Why don't you sit this one out? Look, you want us to go after the bad guys, We're gonna go after the bad guys! And we're gonna go after them hard! Yeah, right. I said, "let's go after the bad guys." But not Jimmy Ford. You honestly think that you can put your own father behind bars? You got to stop looking at him as my father. He's a mark like any other mark. He's hurting people. We can do this. It's what we do. It's our job to go after the bad guys. It's not your job to take down your own father. No. It's my pleasure. [ beeping ] hey, guys, Andrei, our first victim... He just got a call. Okay. Let's go. All right, Andrei's scared, But he's told us what they've asked him to do. He's been tapped because of his access. Now, he's supposed to get into the precinct On one of his routine maintenance calls And install a black box. With that, the Russians can spoof phone calls Off the hardwired phone trunk. Can you turn it off remotely? No, the system's too antiquated for a digital hack. So Jimmy can control which alarms reach the precinct And which don't. Like silent alarms? From banks? Or any building with a high security system. So if we can't hack it, how do we stop him, then? Unh-unh. No, no, no. We mustn't stop him. If Andrei doesn't do what they say, Then they're gonna go after his family. All right, so [clears throat] we don't stop him. We help him. [ sighs ] Eliot. [ handcuffs click ] [ police radio chatter, telephones ringing ] [ Boston accent ] what? Hey, hey, hey, bartender! Get me a drink! Eliot: Quiet down. Hey. Detective Moffat. This is Detective Davies. We're with district eight. What do you got? Oh-ho. Who the hell are you, cupcake? Huh? Huh? You want to know who I am? I'm viola. [ singsong voice ] viola Dagostino. Of the Dagostinos. We got her husband, we got a brother, And both uncles up at eight. Got her on a drunk and disorderly, Heaven knows that's not gonna keep her away for long, We got to store her somewhere away from the press. Yeah, I got you. Let me call it in. All right. Nate, incoming. [ cellphone rings ] [ Boston accent ] eighth district here. Ah, yes, yes. She's a handful. One little drink. Okay, you're good. Just take her downstairs to the drunk tank. It's empty. Gotcha. Sophie: [ normal voice ] Eliot! Come on! [ scoffs ] make it snappy! Being handcuffed in a police station Is a recurring bloody nightmare of mine. Eliot: How do we look? This baby's a lot more sensitive than what Andrei has access to. See... We can block alarms, We can trigger alarms, but most importantly, We can track alarms. [ beeping ] it should be synchronized. Nate? [ beeping ] [ normal voice ] all right, we're good. Let's get the hell out of here, then. Sophie? Unh-unh. No. My exit is with Parker. See you on the outside, cupcakes. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Where's he at? Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's gone! Lucille! Lucille 2.0! He's off comms. He's off the reservation. I know what he's up to. You interfered. How unlike you. Where I come from, this is not tolerated. We're nowhere near where you come from, so just shut up. Let me tell you what I did. I know what you did. You, uh, let our repairman loose. Well, this repairman, you know, was a liability, all right? He... he could've panicked, Or he could've tipped off any of those cops at the precinct. I mean, he's, um, he's not like us. Us? Us. Yeah. Yeah. You know, using a civilian was a brute-force move, But, uh, let me show you a more elegant way of doing... [ guns cock ] whoa, whoa! No, that's all right. I'm just, uh, I'm getting a remote-control device Out of my pocket, fellas. All right? I just want to show you A more elegant way of doing business with this remote. You have much finer control over your phone lines Than you could ever hope for. Now, this is an unexpected gift from you, my son. Thank you very much. Now you can go. No, no, no. No, no. Only I control the box. You try to take this from me, I will destroy the black box. I will. All right? I'll do it remotely. Didn't see this coming. Like I said, this is my town now. You want to pull a job this big in my town... I want in. He's setting us up I just got out of prison. Ops. You escaped. And yet, you do not run. Why is this? Huh? Because you are, how do you say, a narc. If you'd done your homework, You'd know that I set up a warden, Brought him down, and got myself a free pass at the same time. Nobody could do this. I did from inside a prison. Now, if I can do that, think what I could do for you. Or to you. Well, carrot in one hand, stick in the other. That's a hard way to come at them. Well, I learned from the best. He's in. [ inhales sharply ] Okay. What's the plan? All right. Pay attention. I don't like you. Gee, does that mean I can't come to your birthday party And ride the pony? First Boston Independent, State street branch of the Boston bank, Commonwealth loan and securities. Now... First independent's got a Glenn-reeder alarm system, series f-900. Two guards in the front, [laughing] one guard in the back. Cameras record... not monitored. Daily turnover... $2 million. State street... mostly commercial papers and loans, But they do have bearer bonds in a basement lockdown room. Just takes a key and a retina scanner. Commonwealth... they... [laughs] Their alarm system's a holdover from the '70s, But... [laughs] But it's... What? What do you guys do on your weekends? There's something wrong with you. So, which one's he gonna hit? None of them? None of them. But, see, since we control the precinct alarm system, The cops are gonna think they're being robbed. Now, think of this, Nathan... Three banks being robbed at the same time. They're gonna think it's Armageddon. Every cop in town Is gonna be heading towards those three banks. Yeah. And away from...? Mm-hmm. Away from what? Nate: I don't know. He won't tell me. Yet. He won't tell me yet. You realize how many banks there are South of the precinct? 67. Jimmy: You keep your eye on the queen. You learn this, you'll be in good stead. Now, pay attention. Are you watching at all? That's the best you can do? It's not the best you can do. What, are you being a wise guy with me? Okay, guys, it's three-card Monte, see? We got to find the red queen. Right now, we got too many cards in play. There's still the third phone. That's for you and Eliot. You're gonna find the guy, get his story, all right? Sophie, downstairs... That equipment in the back is used for the job. Go get us a look. Okay. I'll take Parker. What are you gonna do? Me? I'm gonna go get my father to, uh, trust me enough To tell me the whole plan. I'm gonna go help him plan a bank robbery. Jimmy: That's George Pimsleur... Works at Hancock alarm security, And in that briefcase is a binder With all the schematics and codes Of all the alarm systems they installed, Including the alarm system on our real target. Which is what? Oh, my boys kick his teeth in, they take his wallet, His briefcase, watch, maybe... And over in five minutes. Eh, well, we could. Or we could, uh, take what we want, And the mark never knows he's been hit. How many men? Two. You and me. [ laughs ] What... what are we doing? Okay, you got to... you got to limp. Which leg? Your left leg. All right. We're gonna do the pill scam. There you go. Excuse me, sir? Sir! I'm sorry to bother you. Do you have change for a $20? Uh, the machine's broke over here. I got to get my car out. Got to get my dad to dialysis. Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Hang on. Thank you so much. Oh! Oh, no! Oh! Oh, dad. Oh, dear. Those are so expensive. I appreciate your... My mom's got heart trouble. These damn pills cost a fortune, I know. Yeah. There's one over there, too. Yeah. Ah, I sure appreciate that. You all right there, dad? Yeah, yeah, feel just fine. Okay, we're almost... okay. Your mother... Thank you. Would be very proud of you. No problem, sir. You both take care now. Nice of the guy. That's not bad. Oh, well, thank you.

Penza! I'm from Lipetsk. What is your name? Rada. No, this is my mother's name... rada. Shut up! I wish I did speak some Russian. You know, my mom and dad died when I was just a little kid, And she didn't want me speaking it, so... And for you to say "my name's rada," Menya zovut rada. No, no, no, you got to go slower. [ chuckles ] MaÃ±ana... no! That's Spanish! [ laughs ] [ intermittent beeping ] Hardison: Yeah, next red phone is right ahead. We just got to figure out who has it. Officer: Hey, Moffat! Hey. Hey. [ both laugh ] how you doing? What are you guys doing back in our district? Oh, uh, I think you guys are holding a gun That was tagged in a case we caught. Hey, let me get you one here. This is the best coffee this side of town. All right. You know, you want to get in there before the shift changes. Yeah. 'cause that evidence... That ships out to Holyoke first thing tomorrow morning. [ beeping ] and that is a drive you do not want to make. I don't want to make that drive. [ laughing ] no! There you go. Thank you so much. All right, good to see you. Thank you so much for this. [ chuckles ] You sure that's the same red phone? Yeah. Look, is it me or does this make less sense Every time we find something out? Pretty much. Jimmy: [ laughing ] it sure is. You were supposed to call us! Huh? To hit the alarm man. Ah, yeah, well, Nathan here... He took care of it with a little soft touch. Hey. Nate: Ah. Yes, please. It's OD work. Here you go, Sonny boy. That. Yeah, zeah. You can go. No, actually, I'm not going anywhere. He says I'm in, I'm in. I am so sick of this idea about you... Stop waving that gun in my face. You're so tough, prove it. Oh! Ah! All right. Go on in there. Come on. I got your back. Thanks, dad. Yeah, yeah. There you go. Come on. We don't have to do this. It's all right. Oh. [ punches landing ] [ glass breaks ] [ groans lightly ] "stop waving a gun in my face and prove it." [ both laugh ] Yeah, well, I had to have it out with the guy. I mean, I'd rather he punch me in the face Than shoot me in the back. No, no. You really went at it back there. What was it you used to always say to me? "you're too much of a thinker, Nathan. You need to, uh, be... be more of a scrapper to survive." Yeah, well, I'm never wrong. That, too, you used to always say. [ chuckles ] Well, I gotta tell you, I doubted your intentions when you came to join this lot. Join this lot? No. Joining you. You. These guys, they're a dime a dozen, pop. I mean... Yeah, but that dime a dozen Are getting tougher every year, ain't it? What do you hope to get Out of this, uh, this plan you're cooking up? Without giving you any particulars, I plan to make a small fortune out of this, Nathan. Wait, wait, wait. So one last job? If there's enough money in it, yeah. Okay. And then? Get on a boat. Go back to where your grandfather came from. You know, uh, you still got Some pretty cousins back there, you know. So... all right, so... This... this... this big last score, And the great Jimmy Ford, what, goes to Ireland to retire? That... That's quite a picture. You ever wish ma was joining you? She didn't really understand me, Nathan. But she loved me. That's more important. [ normal voice ] you were up late. Yeah, I was out trying to get information from my dad. Oh, good. So you know what bank he's gonna hit, then. Today's the day. I know. Nate, this would be really hard on anyone. You don't have to do this. Yes, I do. I'm the only one who can. [ sighs ] [ door closes ] All right, dear old dad, You're now gonna tell me everything, Because I... No, come on. [ sighs ] Aah! All right, go on in there. Come on. I got your back. Thanks, dad. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There you go. Nate, what's the deal? He cleared out. They're on the job, and we have no idea what the job is. We got the warehouse guy and the coffee guy... No, no, we have no idea what he's doing. ...Already in play. [ men speaking Russian ] Look what I found in the alley. Oh, great. A map that we've seen before. Hey, this is not her fault. You're the one who let your dad walk out of here. Oh, good, we got our room back. Nate, the plans you got were from the Hancock alarm company. We just need Hardison to figure out How many banks in this radius have got Hancock alarms. 23. Assuming it is a bank. 'cause I don't know what you would be doing With one of these in a bank. It's the same one that Parker saw in Pieter's bag. A bar-code scanner. It scans a bar-code label And compares it to a remote database. But what are they doing with it? We still got the coffee guy in play. What's he up to? It's a lot of cops, man. Uh, maybe he's drugging them. Slows down response time. That's a good idea. He could have drugged them. You think he'd drug the whole precinct? Come on! Jimmy: All right, which one? You're not paying attention. Pay attention. Are you watching at all? We got the lady here. Which one? We got to start all over again? Pay attention. Think about it. You're never gonna get this, are you? You're just never gonna get it. These are not queens! You understand me?! Don't get me pissed off! Does it look like there's a queen in there? You're never gonna get this, are you? You can't figure that out for yourself? I want an answer. Guys, I know where he's going. What's the trick to three-card Monte? The queen's never even on the table. It's not a bank. Hardison, where do the police keep evidence, I mean the really valuable stuff? That evidence, that ships out to Holyoke First thing tomorrow morning. In the district, then they transfer it out. Russians. The Russians. Remember that big bust last month? They lost $20 million in merchandise to the police. That's gotta hurt. They got to get drugs, guns, and $20 million. It's on the move. Today. That's correct. Ready to get out of here, boys? Mm-hmm. Thanks. Come on, guys. Let's go. All right. [ beeping ] [ beeping ] [ monitor beeps ] Whoa, we got a silent alarm call at First Boston Independent. [ beep ] [ beeping ] [ monitor beeps ] oh, we got another alarm call. This one is at Boston bank at state. [ monitor beeping ] we got a third one! It's commonwealth.

I told you, Boston bank, First Boston Independent, and commonwealth. Evidence transfer? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're good. I just need bodies out there. Get the 2nd, the 4th, the 10th districts over there. [ siren wailing, tires screech ] All right, you know the plan. Run and hack at the same time... sure. All right, wait... wait a second. Let's go over this, all right? Stop. Why don't you just tell the cops everything? The Russians could start shooting. Still, there's enough cops to handle... all right, we stick to the plan, The Russians will go down. And your father. Oh, I've got him. I want to look him in the eye when I put him down. Yeah, you're expecting us. Where's your transfer order? That's it. Let me see that. [ grunts ] All right. Start your timer. Five-minute grace, then the system resets. All the evidence is bar-coded. You'll find your stuff in here someplace... All your guns, all your drugs. [ beeping ] Okay, it's good. [ speaking Russian ] go, go! [ Boston accent ] oh, look at that! That's him! He's the one!

Artie van's ledger. Yeah, they made copies. Oh, you know that won't hold up. The original disappears, The case against the big families goes away, And who do they owe? Jimmy Ford, the biggest fixer in town. Let's join up. Together, we can run this town. It's too late. What do you mean? My people are gonna take down the Russians, And any minute now, the cops are gonna come through that door. I'm not going back to prison. All right. [ gun cocks ] Right here. You can't do this.
