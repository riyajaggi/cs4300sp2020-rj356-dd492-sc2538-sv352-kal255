 A-shift ascending mine. B-shift descending in five minutes. - Nice work today, guys. Appreciate it. - Thanks. You too. Nice work. Appreciate it. Good job. See you tomorrow. - How you doing? - How'd it go there today? Good. Except I found 3/10% of methane in the number four heading. So we went ahead and held the curtain closer to the face. I'll take another reading when I get down there. - You coming to Cory's birthday party? - Of course. - What is he, like 13? - 14. - Can't believe it. - We're getting old.

 You want Lisa to make her potato salad? - Only reason you were invited, boy. - I'm not paying you boys to lollygag! - Talk to you later. - All right. See you later. Oh, my god! - Somebody call for help! - Call my lawyer. Go on, Mr. Rollins. I lost 12 brothers that day. - What caused the explosion? - It was a buildup of methane gas. See, the mine had substandard ventilation. We all knew about it, But there ain't nothing we could do. So I guess getting another line of work wouldn't be an option. Mines are the only way to make a decent living around there. I'm not looking for your charity, Mr. Ford. We like the work. We'd just like to be able to do it safely is all.

 I understand. So the CEO of the mine, this Dan Blackwell, he received government money after the explosion. Figures... You kill your own men, and Uncle Sam writes you a check. That money was supposed to go to mine-safety improvements. I don't know where that money went, but it didn't make it into the mine. That place is just as bad now as it was two years ago. - Maybe worse. - All right. We're gonna find that money, and we're gonna put it back where it belongs. Thank you. Thank you. The rich and powerful take what they want. We steal it back for you. Sometimes, bad guys make the best good guys. We provide leverage! It turns out Blackwell did use the money for safety measures... Or one big safety measure. - She's named Debra Pierce. - West Virginia Attorney General. Her hair's so poofy. Thanks to a recent supreme court decision removing limits on corporate campaign contributions, Blackwell was able to sink all of his safety money into Pierce's political action committee. So instead of making the mines safer, he hired himself an Attorney General. He's getting his money's worth. Since the explosion two years ago, Blackwell has received nearly 400 citations for unsafe working conditions. Even he can't just make 400 citations disappear. - Can he? - No, but he can bury 'em. What he does is he appeals them, and Pierce makes sure that those appeals go on forever. So while the citations are under appeal, he doesn't have to pay a cent. We can't go after Blackwell with an AG in his back pocket. No, but we can take down both of them. What we do is we get Blackwell to give us the money from the pac, And then once that money is transferred, we flag both of them for misuse of campaign funds. - The skagway shuffle. - That's what I was thinking. See, now y'all are just making stuff up. - It's like the fiddle game. - Yeah, only underground. - Is Eliot gonna be the fiddle again? - No. - Can I be the fiddle? - No. The mine is the fiddle. We convince him he's got something valuable in his mine, then we sell him a process to mine it, and then we take all his money. Right. Good. - So, how are we gonna do that? - We're gonna sell the guy his own mine. Subtitles edited by Ehhhhtozebec All right. There he is. - This here is section "B". - Section "B". All right. Basically, I need you to point me out a direction where I can be out of the way. - No problem. That'd be section "C". - Section "C". Hey, Cory! Come here! He's a good kid. He'll show you around. Listen. Be careful back there. That section's been abandoned for years, and them old wooden mine supports is unstable. - Yeah, boss. - This here is Eric. I need you to show him to section "C" so he can do some dust readings. This way. Morning. - Can I help you? - I'm Cara Hetzel. This is Jesse Oaks. We're here from the mine safety coalition to do a spot inspection. Fine. Let me get my mine supervisor, show you around... Clark! Can you... be so kind as to show the inspectors around? Be careful what kind of rocks you turn over down there. Mining can be a dangerous business. It sure can. Who are you? Mr. Blackwell. Bob Gibson. I'm here to make you an offer you can't refuse. - Really? - I want to buy your mine. Excuse me? I didn't realize you were hard of hearing I heard that can happen to miners. I want to buy your mine. Mine's not for sale. I was afraid you'd say that. I'm gonna write down a little number, and we'll stop playing these games. The mine is not for sale. Or are you hard of hearing? You don't have to be rude. I just want to give you an opportunity to make a lot of money. Now, look, I know you country folk, you like the simple life. But the simple life looks a lot better on the back of a 100-foot yacht, say. I appreciate your generosity, Mr. Gilman. Bob Gibson. I'm doing fine on my own. If you say so. Listen, if you change your mind, give me a call. Okay, Parker. Are you in place? Almost. - You sure someone else can't do this? - We need all hands on deck on this one. Just do what Sophie told you. A great grift is like a romance. You have to find out what they want and just give it to them. You have to woo them. I don't woo. Tell me how you break into a bank. Clock the cameras, count the guards, find the silent alarms, look for a weak spot to enter, pick the vault's combination, and steal the money. Just analyze Pierce the same way you would a security system. Here. Take notes. There's your mark. Find her weak spots. With politicians, it's usually a need for adoration. The same way that you wear black to mask yourself from security cameras, Flattery can mask your intentions. Find the right combination, and you can unlock the mark's trust. - And then you can steal her... - Soul. I was gonna say "confidence". You can do this, Parker. Just trust your instincts. Parker, go! Under my continued direction, the people of West Virginia will be known as the people who love freedom, who love justice, and who fight for what they love! And who fight for what they love. Will you let me continue to fight for you? Yes, yes, and yes! Beautiful speech, Ms. Pierce. - Who are you? - I'm your biggest fan. And hopefully, your new campaign consultant... I've been following your career since your first term in the state senate. And this is your chamber where you dispense justice and fight for freedom! - Still didn't catch your name, sweetie. - Kelly Beth? Kelly Beth Laughlin? But you can call me Kelly Beth. Can I call you "boss"? Darlin', as much as I'd love your energy in the homestretch of this campaign, I don't have much of a budget for a campaign consultant. I'm Kelly Beth Laughlin... of the Maysville Laughlins. See, I don't need a salary. In fact, I would pay for the experience of working for you. Damn, I'm happy to work with anybody willing to pay for it. Welcome aboard Team Pierce. I'm in. Section "C." So, what did you do to get stuck with busy work? Me? I'm the new guy. What's your story? - I'm the young guy. - Yeah? How old are you? - 18. - 18? Why aren't you in school? School doesn't pay the mortgage. You're a little young to have a wife and kid, aren't you? It's my mom and my sister. My dad was in the explosion two years ago. I'm sorry. Now, there's no cell reception underground. The miners use a leaky feeder signal to communicate in the mine. But that's not compatible with our comms. I know. Quite the problem. You're wondering if I have an answer? I do. I created these UHF wireless nodes to couple with the leaky feeder, boost the signal, - And then we... - I know! I put them in the mine! - Yeah, but they're very... - What? I got it! They're fragile! I thought we was making progress. Section C's prepped. And now to section "C"? Right this way. - What is that? - Dust reading. That doesn't look like no dust-reading kit. You don't look like no certified MSC safety inspector. Look. You're sure? Yes, I understand the DA would like this taken care of, but you remind him that my time is valuable and he hasn't bought any of it recently. Thank you. - Getting comfy? - Yes, ma'am. I've set up re-election facebook and twitter accounts, opened a political action committee called tomorrow's women to consolidate the online donations. I like it. And so far, we've raised 436 dollars. Color me pink and put me in a pigpen. You're a fast worker. You know what they say about idle hands. - How many fines am I not paying today? - None. They took some weird tests, said they were dust readings. - What do you think they were? - No idea. But they looked pretty pleased with whatever they found. What are the odds of the shady inspectors and the... man trying to buy my mine showing up here on the same day, you think? I'd say not good. They mention where they might be going? They did ask for a commendation on a place to eat. I sent 'em on down to carver's. Did they buy the safety-inspection bit? Absolutely. Right on schedule. You're up. - Great work today! You're a peach! - I'll talk to you later, Mr. Gibson. - Hello, there, again, Mr. Blackwell. - Just cut the act. Who are you, and what are you doing with Mr. Gibson? You know, impersonating a federal safety inspector is a felony in West Virginia. My name is Eloise Tinson. I'm a mineral extraction expert. I'm in town to make Mr. Gibson a very wealthy man, take home a little something for myself. Your expertise is wasted on Mr. Gibson. He doesn't own the mine. On the contrary, Mr. Blackwell, he owns the 400 acres to the north and east of yours. And I hear he made a little offer on yours today. Mine's not on the market. And... his land is mined out years ago. Yes. For coal. We're looking for something a little more... lucrative. - Coltan? - Columbite-tantalite. It's a mineral found in cellphones, DVD players, computers. It's found in abundance in central Africa. Frankly, everything's a bloody mess over there. American companies are desperate to get their hands on a domestic source. What is your role in all this? My company developed a process for locating and mining Coltan. Mr. Gibson is buying that process. If there's Coltan in my mine... Mr. Gibson isn't gonna get his hands on it. According to the readings that my partner and I took today, yes, there is Coltan in your mine. And using our process, Mr. Gibson is gonna be able to mine it - right out from under you. - The hell he will. You're not the only one with a partner. Blackwell just left Sophie. Did you plant the form? It's on her desk with the other forms you gave me. Good. Make sure she finds it. How do you do it? How do you handle all this? The thing about justice is, it's messy. It's kind of like a sewer, and I'm the one who controls the pipe. When things are running smoothly, no one pays any attention. But you know what happens when you lose control. - It stinks! - Exactly. And I'm the one who ends up with you-know-what on her face. I make it my first priority. Make sure all the dung's running in the right direction. Hello. Hi. It's Dan. Do you have a mineral rights application for the land next to mine? - Cream... - Six sugars. Bob Gibson. Tract 516. Applying for all mineral rights both known and unknown. What could be unknown? Coltan. Listen, do you think you could lose that application? I could put it on the bottom of the pile, but... I'm sure he filed a copy with the development department. It's gonna turn up eventually. That's good enough. I just need you to stall him. You gonna tell me what Coltan is? Hello? Ms. Tinson? Listen, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. Mr. Gibson is not gonna be buying your process. And why is that? Because I'm gonna buy it first. But I'm gonna need a demonstration, if you could... stop by the mine first thing tomorrow? Until then. Till then. He's hooked. Our sonar-detection technology tells us exactly where the Coltan is located. Look at that. There's a very strong presence of Coltan in here. Really? This is quite a fancy machine. I hope you don't mind if I double-check the old-fashioned way? Coltan's generally found in isolated pockets, so those surface tests, they can be very inconclusive. I'm sure. We'll see here. - Look at that. - That looks conclusive to me. Rock-dusting duty. It seems like Troy's doing everything he can to keep us from real work. This is real work. Somebody's got to keep the coal out of our lungs. This looks different than usual. It does. Look here, bro. Limestone dust laced with Coltan is gonna look different than plain old limestone dust. I appreciate your faith in me, but I do not have the power to change the chemical composition of minerals. Lab geeks must have come up with something new. A formula or... This area right here is lighting up like a Christmas tree. You'll be able to get a good six months out of that vein. This area, not so much. But... this right down here... Now, this... You'll be able to put that new addition on your house and... get that fishing boat you've been wanting. No more digging blind. It sounds good to me. You know, maybe I'll be able to lay off some of these, Hillbillies I pay to dig in the dirt all day long here. Mining used to be worthwhile, you know. But now with the unions and the workers whining all the time, about not getting paid enough and they're never safe enough and all. I mean, it's hard to keep a business and make a buck. I'm pretty confident using this process, you'll be able to make quite a few bucks. I'm convinced. Excellent. Let's talk numbers. All right. Well, he's got 125,000 dollars liquid. And $500,000 in the pac. $600,000. We're gonna need it in one payment. We've found that installments can get a little bit messy. Of course. By tomorrow. Mr. Gibson was gonna write us a check in the morning. Now, if that's gonna be a problem for you... No problem. I'm having a fundraiser for the Attorney General at the Morgan Club tomorrow. You stop by there, I'll cut you a check. Perfect. Sophie's done with Blackwell. He's hooked. You can surface. I don't want to leave these guys one man down. Okay. Fine. You can finish the day. But tomorrow, we're gone. Paul Revere make that lunchbox? Nope. This was made in 1958. Paul Revere died in the early 1800s. What? You don't think I know who Paul Revere is? All right, smartass. This was my dad's. Grandpa's before that. Scoop seems to be running a little slow this morning. - Transmission's slipping again. - All right. I'll look into it. You want to be the man of the house... That's the way right there. Future's in the machines. It's faster, it's safer. You want to provide for your family, learn how to use the scoop. I'm just saying. You got a good head for it... Paul Revere. Your latest numbers are up. Significantly up. I don't think I ever seen it jump this high. Really? Nate said to make them higher. How am I supposed to know what's "significantly higher" and what's "insignificantly higher"? No, that's fine. We just need her to feel she has a comfortable lead so she'll be fine with Blackwell using the pac funds. We must be doing something right. Yeah, must be your latest commercial... Or your hair... People love your hair. Really? Hello, Dan. Refill? I like this one. Blackwell's here. It's happening. No way! I have an election coming up. The Coltan mine's not gonna do you any good without me keeping it from getting shut down! If I don't have that money by tomorrow, they're gonna sell this process to Gibson. So? Use the mine's money. The mine doesn't have that sort of liquidity. You're paying your workers with something, aren't you? Yeah. I suppose I could take the... money out the payroll. But that would bankrupt the mine. You say that like it's a bad thing. All right. Here we go. Clark? Tell the men not to come to work tomorrow. All of 'em. And make sure there's nobody in that mine. And then call me back. I got a job of work for you to do. That's a great day's work. Blackwell's shutting down the mine and using the payroll money to pay us. So we've just bankrupted an entire town. Worse. He's not justhutting down the mine. He's blowing it up. That does sound worse. You know, working in insurance, I've seen this play a thousand times. And now that we've convinced him he has Coltan, his mine is worth more dead than alive. He's not gonna have time to get a bomb and plant it in the mine by tomorrow. His mine is practically a bomb already. You could throw a lit cigarette there, and that thing would blow. - Won't take much. - What are we gonna do, Nate? We're gonna convince him that you're a lying, greedy bitch. I'm gonna call Blackwell and draw him here. He's not gonna blow up the mine while he's in it, is he? That will give us enough time to find the bomb. Plenty of time. Meanwhile, I'll be here, in the van, as far away from the mine as possible. My dude. Go with god. - What are you doing, man? - For morale, man! Let's get this show on the road. Mr. Blackwell. Yeah, it's Bob Gibson here. Mr. Gibson. You calling to concede? No, I'm calling to tell you that we've both been had. Yeah, there's no Coltan in your mine or anywhere near it. I should have pegged you for a sore loser. I can prove it to you. Just meet me at the mine in 15 minutes. No, the mine's not a good idea. Now, maybe we can meet somewhere else... This is Clark. Leave a message. Listen. Where the hell are you? Now, don't plant the device. I'm on my way to the mine now. Do not plant the device. He's on his way to you now. While they deal with Blackwell, we've got to spook Pierce. On it. So we need ghosts. No. We need secrets. We've got to get her to move the money out of the pac. Thank you. Right. Tell me everything you know about her. I've got some really good stuff in here. She likes sugar in her coffee. Lots of sugar. And she hides tasty treats on her desk. She's got a sweet tooth... maybe we could use that. Probably not. What else? She never takes calls from her mother. I got it. She mixes her blue pens with her black pens in the same cup. Like mixes them together. Parker, I'm looking for something that someone might find weird. Someone normal. Someone normal might find weird. Thursday afternoon, she had a closed-door meeting with Blackwell, but... it sounded like they were working out. "Working out"? Hardison, do you still have the audio file saved? Yeah, but there's like 100 hours of it. I haven't listened to it all yet. No. Just pull up the files from Thursday afternoon. - Between 3:26 and 4:15. - Okay. One second. Old people! Parker, they're not working out. They're... You know. Sex, Parker! They're knocking boots. - Can you use that? - With that... I can make her do anything I want. This has been real cool, but I have to get back to helping Eliot find the bomb. I'm switching out oxygen meter. All right, man. I've hacked into their monitoring system to detects peaks in any heat to show us where Clark planted the bomb. - Where's it at? - No idea. This thing runs like an atari. It's great if you want to play "Frogger", but to find a bomb? While you're playing video games, I'm gonna still be looking for the bomb. If you decide to be helpful, let me know. And thank you so much for your contribution. Nice to meet you. Ms. Pierce, I was hoping to steal a minute of your time. I've heard so much about you. - Of course, Ms... - Tinson. Eloise Tinson. Right. The Coltan woman. In the flesh. I have to say, it's been such a delight working with Danny. "Danny"? - You mean Mr. Blackwell. - Of course. The addition of this Coltan mine is gonna do wonders for the state, and I wanted to thank you personally for your contribution. I'm sorry? My contribution? There's no need to be modest. It's your money. Or is it the pac money? I never quite got that straight. That's odd, because... yesterday he told me he was using the mine funds for the purchase. No. That's not what he said last night. Or was it this morning? Time got a bit blurred. Regardless, I'm pretty confident he said he was using the pac money and that he was gonna make the transfer today. So... Thank you. Thank you so much. Great turnout. Can I get you anything? - What's wrong, Ms. Pierce? - That thieving, cheating bastard! You know, being down here isn't such a good idea. I had the Coltan reports looked at off-site, and I got to tell you, the results were confusing. Maybe we could talk about this aboveground. Section "C" is clear. Now, if you take a little bit off the surface here, Right? It indicates the presence of Coltan. Right? All right. Now I'm just gonna go a little deeper here. Nothing. - Those bastards salted my mine. - They almost took your money, too. Wait, wait. I think I got something, man. There are anomalies in the levels in the northeast quadrant. Speak english! Turn right. Find bomb. - He's here. - Who? - Cory. - Look, man. Unless that's a cute little name you got for the bomb, I'm compelled to remind you of your mission. Find the bomb. Dismantle. Save lives. I'm on it. All right? Just stop talking! I don't believe they tried to pull one over on me. Actually, I do believe they did pull one over on you. That was me who figured out what it was they were up to. I don't have time to discuss this. We got to get the hell out of here. You there? Hello? Nate, are you there? I'm here. I've lost Nate. - What do you mean, you've lost Nate? - I don't know. His comm is down. - You need to get down here. - Parker, meet me at the car now. One second. That takes care of that. I need you to get new keys made for my office and call security. I don't want Dan Blackwell stepping foot in that building. Yes, ma'am. - Sounded like something collapsed. - What you're doing down here? Figured now was a good time to work on the machinery, - since no one's here. - That's using your head. You shouldn't be doing this alone. Come on. We got to go. Go! - What the hell happened? - I don't know. Explosion of some kind. You got yourself a nice little deathtrap here, don't you? We wouldn't be in this situation if you hadn't insisted to drag us down here for some science experiment. You want to point fingers, or do you want to you want to get us out of here? There's no way out! Somebody's gonna have to find us! I don't like anybody leaving my parties in such a hurry. There's been an accident at the mine. Dan's trapped. - We have to get over there. - Let the cheating bastard suffocate. I'm not letting either of you steal my money. - Nobody's trying to steal your money. - I know when I'm being played. I'm just gonna put this money where no one can get to it. Fine. It's just money. We need to get over there. If I were you, I'd worry about yourself. Someone as pretty as you is not gonna do well in one of our prisons. Our women... they don't take kindly to outsiders. What do you mean by that? I called the cops. They should be here any minute to arrest you on fraud, racketeering, and impersonating a federal officer. You can't get me arrested. Sure, I can. It's one of the perks of being Attorney General. I own the law. Debra, we're on the same side here. Dan deceived us both. You both deceived me. - Now, I am done being lied to. - Ms. Pierce! - I have a phone call for you. - Not now. Not now! Damn it. Now look what you did! - Sergeant Astin. - Sergeant. - Yes, ma'am. - Meet me at the mine. Right away. I'm on my way. What are you doing in here? We left a couple of things and... - The mine's closed. - Right. Go! How much oxygen we got? 19%. 19? It drops below 15, we're goners! Both of us in the room, - we only got about two hours. - You're right. We only have two hours. Say, what about this intercom? I mean, can't we... You know, call for help or something? No, you can't radio out. It don't work. - What do you mean? - You got all that money. I mean, you got new intercoms. You got new ceiling supports. You got new retrofit ventilation. I mean, I saw the paperwork. It's all fake. Hold on there. What do you mean, it's all fake? The ceiling support and the ventilation and the intercom... that's all fake. The only safety measures that that money bought... went to the Attorney General. All the government money went to her. Is that right? Great investment. There's got to be a way out of here, right? There might be if we look down there! There's got to be a way out of here, right? Look down there to your... Clark! Mr. Blackwell! It's Eric! Eric Randall! I'm almost through! - Can you squeeze? - Yeah. Yeah, I can get through. - Are you okay, sir? - I'm fine. Just get me out of here. Mr. Blackwell! Stop right there. What the hell are you talking about? Wait! You're under arrest! Wait! No, wait a minute, now. I'm the victim here. Mr. Gibson was responsible for that explosion. He was trying to take my mine. He planted that bomb. What do we have here? This bomb? All right, Eliot. I think I got a lock on the bomb. - I got it. - What's it look like? Red wires, blue wires? What? Boom! You're not funny. - Are you okay, sir? - I'm fine. Just get me out of here. Look. What caused that explosion? I was trapped in there. Micro detonator, surround sound, dust spray, modified oxygen meter, and... What? What? Yes, I do spend my weekends making these things. Man, we're coming to a mine. It's not rocket science. I like it. It gives him a whole village people, construction-dude thing. - Thank you. - Okay. I'm gonna call Blackwell and draw him here. It's a controlled blast. So as long as you stay to the right of the "x," You should be fine. I'll be controlling the oxygen meters. I don't believe they tried to pull one over on me. Actually, I believe they did, in fact, pull one over on you. - Deb, what the hell is going on? - They heard everything, you moron! You're right. We only have two hours. Nate, whatever you did, you just got your comm back up, so listen. I've wired your comm transmission to the PA system. You get that confession, and Eliot will come get you. Say, what about this intercom? I mean, can't we... call for help or something? - It's all fake. - What do you mean, it's all fake? Ceiling supports and the ventilators And the intercoms... it's all fake. The only safety measures that money bought was the Attorney General. All the government money went to her. Ma'am? No, no. Wait, wait. This is a mistake. There's nothing wrong here. You think you can get us out of this? I'm not getting you out of anything, you cheating bastard! Just settle down. You settle down. You settle down! You just can make a phone call. They give you one... No, I can't make a phone call! - They give you one. - I can't make a phone call! Nailed it. A few of the guests want to make a corporate donation. Should I direct them to your political action committee account - or the one I set up? - The one you set up? "Tomorrow's women." Told you about it the other day. Anyway you're authorized on that account you can take money out any time. Can I transfer money in? Sure. Here's the account number. That takes care of that. Pierce transferred all the pac funds into Parker's account. - Nicely done. - I had a little help from Sophie. But, yeah, I nailed it. I'm a grifter. I grift. You do know you don't get to keep the money, right? Don't ruin it. What are you doing? Stealing souls is exhausting. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. "Right hand... Answers phone, left. "Blinks 15 times... Smells like bubbles." Parker, you're not gonna start keeping notepads like this about us, are you? Did you know you touch your chin every 2.5 minutes? Who are you? Really. We're friends of Troy. We came here to make the mine safe. So you're leaving? I'm leaving. But you got a bunch of good ol'boys here to watch your back for you. You remember what I told you. Use that head. Keep you safe. - I will. - Good. That way, I don't have to come back here and whip your ass. All right. Hey, there. Welcome to your new office. - Excuse me? - After Blackwell was arrested, the board removed him as CEO and made you mine supervisor. Now everybody's safety is in your hands. I'll do my best. Well, here. This here should help. - Where did this come from? - That is the federal safety money. See, what happens was Blackwell gave it to Pierce, and Pierce gave it to us, and... More or less. Now you can buy safety equipment that actually works. - Thank you so much. - All right. We'll let you get to it. - Thank you. - Listen, do me a favor. Watch out for Cory for me. - Will do. - All right. You should put him on the scoop. He's got a knack for it. B-shift descending in five minutes.
