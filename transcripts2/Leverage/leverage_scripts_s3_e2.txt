 Sometimes bad guys make the best good guys We provide... Leverage ! All my work, erased, and I was only days away from cracking Manticore. What's "Manticore"? It's an electronic surveillance system. The iranian government uses it to track protesters over cellphones, social networks, even e-mail. Yeah, hacker underground's flipping out about it. They use GPS to pinpoint a dissident, and then they swoop in and make the arrest. The Internet made this protest possible, but now it's just a... a liability? - The government uses the people's weapon against them. - Precisely. I cannot even communicate with my family in Iran.

 Manticore would find them. I have no idea if they are safe. And the Secret Police are everywhere. Next week, our people are planning a protest to coincide with the election. If I can't shut down Manticore, The government will find and arrest every organizer and break the backbone of the movement. We're not spy hunters, Mr. Madavhi. I cannot go to the FBI. My activities would violate my student visa. - So you want your data back. - I want Manticore destroyed. I want my people to be free. All right, well, we'll, uh, we'll discuss it. - "Discuss it"? - Oh, this is so not our game, Hardison. Not our g... Nate, this isn't just some hacker, okay? - Cyrus... - "Cyrus"? It's "Mr. Madavhi." No, instead he risks his life fighting the bad guys. - This is so our game. - He wasn't hit by the Vezarat. - What, are you lurking? - Yeah. I'm a lurker. It's my thing. - What's the Vezarat? - That's the Iranian secret police. And trust me, if they wanted Cyrus, he wouldn't be sitting here talking to us. But the Vezarat is still our logical target. So we should check our sources and see if there's a safe house in the area. - So we're on this? - Yeah, well, we were always on this. I just wanted you to explain to me why. You know how I feel about mind games, Nate. Negatively. What are you looking at, lurker? My sources say this cafe is the local Vezarat safe house. ♪♪♪ Every year, every single year in Dallas, they're gonna win. - Every time. How you doing? - Yes. All right. Lloyd Hickey, Boston Health department. Spot inspection. We were just inspected. Everything is in order here. There's a roach in my shish leek! Uh- huh. Uh- huh. Roach infestation in the shish leek. - That's gonna cost you. - That's gonna cost you. Well, yeah- huh. Let's, uh, have a look at that kitchen, shall we? - Back room, East corner. - Got it. Eliot. Eliot, get rid of it. Ugh! I think he likes you. You're gonna pay for this. Hey, uh, we are gonna actually need to talk to all of your employees. This young fellow, you, sir, you... all the employees. - The young bucktooth chap in the back. - At the East corner. For a den of evil spies, this place smells delicious. Hardison, confiscate some pastries. Okay, no sign of Cyrus' hardware. Well, they could have cloned his data. Let's check their computer. Mnh- mnh. No. This schwarma is lukewarm! Unh- unh. - Wow, that's gonna cost you 5 points. - That's unacceptable. - That's gonna cost you. - No, it's horrible. What, are you... There's nothing on Manticore. I'm starting a syntax search. Are those rat droppings? That image on the, uh, the bottom left, there... "Manticore." Um, it's a mythological creature. It's persian for "Man-Eater." Y- yeah, yeah, I was, I was just about to click on that. What are you Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay, right. Sure. Okay. Let's, uh, copy Cyrus' program. You know, I'd love to, but it's not here. It doesn't even look like they even heard of Cyrus. Okay, I've got payment records here. Last one dated three weeks ago. Those look like clean hands to you? Smell 'em. I got to dock ya! The latest Manticore update was also three weeks ago. And who was that payment to? Larry Duberman, founder and CEO of Dubertech. Back in the '90s, he wrote the book on digital database security. Literally wrote the book. Now, he made a couple hundred million during the, uh, digital revolution. Why would Larry Duberman be selling software to Iran? I mean, he doesn't need the money. Thanks, sugar. Oh, but he does. Cloud storage, distributed processing... See, all these sexy new little technologies are passing up Duberman's company. They're leaving him in the dust. He's got to expand his market share. Okay, so he sells the technology to embargoed countries, and the income is tax-free? It's a nice way to keep the bottom line from being squeezed. Now, Duberman has a long-term contract to run Manticore for Iran. This man has become the IT Department for the axis of evil. All right, so Eliot was right. The Vezarat didn't go after Cyrus, Duberman did. It's not about politics, man. Cyrus is bad business for him. Okay, well, so, Duberman's our target. What are we up against? See, the master control server's in Duberman's private office. We shut down the server over here, we shut down Manticore over there. - So, get to hacking, man. - Dude, what is it about "Wrote the book on database security" that you don't comprehend? I can't just access Manticore remotely we've got to get to that server in person. Any of you ever trimmed a bonsai? Well, you know, I did. I was in Osaka, and I met this Japanese policewoman - At a geisha bar - Uh... An other time... Oh. Why is Eliot pouring your tea? Hmm? Did you brainwash him again? Mm, neuro-linguistic programming. It's amazing what you can do with the power of suggestion. "Sugar." "Squeezed"... a few strategic pats on the arm. - Damn it! - You owe me for that roach business! Sophie, not again. These quarterly results aren't exactly what we'd hoped. Fine. We'll just raise the price for our persian friends. Sir, are you sure that's wise? Where else are they gonna go? McAfee? Oracle? No, they're too soft to get into the suppression business. No, no, if the Iranians want to hold on to power, they have to pay me. That's what I call a good business model. - oh! Watch it! - Oh, God. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Sloane, fire this idiot! - I'm sorry. - A-actually, wait. - You are fired! - Easy, Mr. Hands. Easy. All right. We've got this, Mr. Duberman. Yes, you... you do! Now, I-I want this pristine when I get back from lunch! Whoa. Seems we stepped out of Japan - And straight into high school. - In 1985. You find the server running Manticore? Oh, I found it. A small problem. Nate, he's running Manticore from his high-school computer. Vintage 1980s technology, man. No wonder I couldn't hack in from the outside. It's speaking a dead language. Mr. Duberman left for lunch. Possible breach! Repeat, possible breach! Hey, they're onto us. What's the deal? Well, he's got a multi-tier password system. Now, my war-dialer broke into the first few. Uh..."Zavransky," "Mandydd," a bunch of other random ones. Was that a good beep or a bad beep? Oh, that's a bad beep. We just hit a wall. You didn't get the password? Not the master one. The last one I got is... L33r15L06. High school. Let's go! Hold on, let me just finish copying this disk. How did people get anything done in the '80s? Nobody else thinks it's weird that you can just buy anybody's yearbook online? You know, it's real cute, man, how you still believe in privacy. Here we go. Uh, Mrs. Zavransky, math teacher. Now, I bet if we turn to the cheerleaders... Yes. Oh, Mandy. - Mandy Babson. - What does the "DD" mean? - Seriously? - Yeah, right. Two scoops of ice cream... just perfect. Come on, it's, uh... It was the last password that tipped us off... L33r15L06. Now, that has to be a locker combination, right? He's clearly... he's obsessed with high school... Memorabilia, his high-school computer. Yeah, he's a classic computer nerd. Sorry. Yeah, the girls totally ignored him. The guys picked on him. Now that he's a success, he... he can't leave the past behind him. Yeah, he has to remember who he was 'cause it made him who he is. - Aw, I feel bad for the nerd. - Don't feel bad for this guy. Getting bullied in high school is still no excuse for propping up dictators. He got bulled his whole high- school career. He's not criminal. Um... Yeah, he is. Don't think about that. Not a bad criminal. Hey, what makes you think I got bullied in high school? Well, "A," You got a green hornet doll. Well, first of all, it's a limited-edition action figure. - Second, it is green lantern.Educate yourself. - Wow. - Now pay attention. Get it right. - Guys, wait, wait. Listen, listen. We got a locker combination, we have a teacher's name, and we have a crush. So, Duberman, he has made his old high school his roman room. - Of course. - "Of course"? What's a roman room? You have no idea, right? You know... no. - You don't have any idea? - It's a... it's a memory technique. Each of his passwords corresponds to an object in a space that he's intimately familiar with... In his case, the hallway of his old high school where he kept his locker. Now, if I were to make this bar my roman room, everything I need to remember is right here. For instance, this, uh... My bank password would be "Balmoor." And my e-mail password would be fitzy, here. Hey. Nate just gave us his passwords. No, but I got all his passwords. You want to see his netflix queue? He's got, like, every season of "Rockford files"... Every season of "Sex and the city", that show "Psych". Hey, so, so, listen, if we can't get into the main server without Duberman's master password... I mean, you can't hack into that, right? No, password's up in the guy's head. I can't hack a guy's head. So the only option would be to break inside his Roman room. You want to break into the high school? I could do that blindfolded. - Yeah let's do it blindfolded. - No, no, no. What we're gonna do is we're gonna break into that high school... 25 years ago. What do you know? Class of '85 has a reunion coming up... - In 8 months. - Hmm. Oh, hi. Edna Kasendorf? With the class of '85 alumni committee? Boy, am I glad I reached you. It's Sharon Wing from Radford High. Sharon, how are ya? It's Edna Kasendorf. From the alumni committee. Do I have some bad news. The gym's being renovated in the fall, And it's gonna be a total shambles when it's time for the reunion. The gym available on the 28th? Our most prominent alum, Larry Duberman... Yes... that Larry Duberman insists the reunion happens this month. Oh, don't hate me... This month? Say, the 28th? No. Thank you! You're a doll. I'm gonna send you a boxload of crullahs. Impossible! That is more than double what we agreed to pay for the upgrade. Yeah, well, if you'd rather have your homegrown dweeb squad administer Manticore, be my guest. Though we both know they can barely send an e-vite. ♪♪♪ Yes? Your high- school alumni committee? I'll let you gentlemen discuss this. But know that, when we meet, you can either deliver the money, or I can turn over certain sensitive information to the FBI. They're clients, too. Larry Duberman. A reunion? Uh- huh. The 28th? Well, I certainly appreciate the personal invitation, but I don't know that I... - Who else is coming? - Oh, well, uh, uh... Mandy Babson, of course. You remember her? And, uh, Danny Stoltz. Uh, Jennifer Jakubowski. Uh, Emily Weston... Uh, Drake McIntyre. Really? They'll all be there? Well, then, I wouldn't miss it for the world! Okay. Bye-bye. - Sir, your meeting with the Iranians is the 28th - Sloane... I've spoken at Davos, I've met Presidents and Prime Ministers. I've got a yacht with a squash court. But what's the meaning of any of that if I can't rub it in their faces? Here, let me help you with that. Oh, thanks. So many awkward people in so many ugly outfits. Yeah, you're lucky you never went to high school. Nothing but heartbreak and homework. - Didn't you go to your prom? - Uh...I was kind of busy. Looks like the Bank of Iceland's paying off Nana's medical bills. That's dope! Good times. So, you guys all get to go to the reunion, And I'm stuck on goon patrol? Eliot, listen. Once we get the password, you got to enter it on Duberman's computer and destroy Manticore. Hardison's a little occupied. Besides, I'm sure you already had your high-school fun. Big man on campus. What, quarterback? Come on, Eliot. This is so lame. Quarterbacks do not take home nec. I got my reasons. Phew! Let's get out of here. Eliot... Like this. Knives are like people. It's all about the context. I had many interests. You own this place. Badger, badger, badger, badger, '85! - Great to see you. - Great to see you, too! - Lookin' good, Larry! - Hey! - Ohh. - Yes, it's me, in the flesh. Hi, Larry. Great to see you again. - Hey, Larry! - Hey, I saw you on tv last night. Oh, y-y-you saw me on "Larry king"! Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Which time? - I guess the most current one. - Good to see you, Larry. - You look great. - Really? Uh- huh. - Mr. Voetberg's history class? Yes, we did that paper together on the civil war. B-plus, I believe, because someone didn't do his share of the research. Right, right. Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh... Excuse me just... just a minute. Well, if it isn't the president of the computer club, himself... - Larry Duberman. - It's great to see you, uh... Grace. Pizza-face Grace? Grace Peltz? It's right here on my badge. Yeah. Are you sure you don't remember me? - Of course I remember you. - Well, it's okay. I hardly remember myself. There I am. Right. "Grace Peltz"! I wore glasses since I was 8. Five years ago, I finally got contacts. - Well, you've certainly blossomed. - Well, so have you, Mr. Mogul. Is it true that you have a squash court on your yacht? Yes. Yes, I do. And a bowling alley. Oh! My two favorite sports. Oh, my. Is that... Oh, my gosh, it is. Ew. It's Drake McIntyre. - Drake the snake. - Hey, Drake! Drake McIntyre. - x, y, z, bro. Hmm? - Oh. Drake? Is that you? Mandy, you still got it. You still got it, honey. Hey. Yep. Hey, hey! Hey, what's up? Hey! All right! Drake McIntyre. Looks different. 25 years. People change. Every narrative has a Nemesis. Who's Duberman's? This one. Drake McIntyre. I think I could pass. Hardison? Lucky dude will be winning two tickets To see the Pats play in Miami that weekend. Yo, Doucherman! That's Drake, all right. You don't have to take that from him anymore. - You should say something. - Ohh. In due time. First, can I get you some mystery meat at the buffet? Oh, I already ate. Five months of dieting to fit into this dress. But I'll go with you. Oh. Thanks. How'd you know that was his nickname? Well, with a name like Duberman, Not exactly rocket science. Hey! What's up? Hardison, they're swarming me. Give me something, or they're gonna blow my cover. Got you. I got you. Ally Kassakian... she was the head of the drama club. Mark Pereira... Oh. Ouch. He just divorced his high-school sweetheart, Nancy. Ally, you're looking hot. Still acting? Thank you. Yeah. Yeah? I'll bet you're terrific. Hey, Mark, listen, man. Hey, Drake. Hey, how you doing? I heard about Nancy. I just want to say, it sucks, dude. Oh, I can't believe Jaclyn Thomas had the nerve to show up after what she did to Katherine. Guys, forget about the gossip. Stick with the con. - Hey! - Hey! You know, I'm trying, man. It's just, I feel like I know these people now. Kills me to see a nice girl like Cindy Taylor settle for a guy like Aaron Ferguson. Yeah, all right, listen, I'm gonna lean on Duberman. Get him to the Roman room. I'm going right now. Whoa, I can't believe it! Drake Mac! Whoa, whoa. Hey, Schmitty! Hey, how you doing, pal? "How you doing, pal? " that's all you got for me? Okay, look, I'm... I'm... I'm on it, I'm on it. Ah, "Schmitty." You don't remember? Come on? Schmitty. Schmitty, Schmitty. No, no, there's no "Schmitty" Here. Parker? - Oh! Sorry. - Watch it, girly. - Come on, you don't remember? - Uh... Ferguson's party. We took the 30-pack... Okay, Drake wrote, "I'll always remember those nights "Gettin' wicked pissed and puking off the Medford bridge. Schmitt-head and Mac attack forever"? - Schmitt-head! - Schmitt-head! Mac attack forever! Aah! Aah! Maybe it's a good thing I missed high school. Hey, uh, can you give me one of your crappiest beers - in one of your red plastic cups? - Sure. - Good memories here? - Good and bad. This hall is burned in my mind. - Oh, say, wasn't that Mrs. Zavransky's room? - Had her for homeroom. Yeah, Pat Brander once gave me a wedgie in front of the whole class. Pat Brander. Let's check out Brander. Nope. Okay, look, try "Brander303". That's the room number. It looks like it's unlocked. It's payroll files. All right, guys, patience. If we get him riled up, push his buttons, he'll lead us to the password we want. - Uh, you know... - hey, whoa, hey! Who brought the party out here? Is that Doucherman? Ha ha! How's it hanging there, Doucherman?! - Drake! What a pleasure! - Oh, yeah! And is that, uh, Grace "Felt pants" Peltz... All grown up? Hello, Drake. I assumed you'd be fat. I know, right? You know? Cleaning pools keeps me fit. Listen aren't you a little out of this guy's league? - Yes, he is! - Quit it! Quit! We're not 18 anymore! I'm just reliving the good old times. You know? Oh, "Good times"? Y-y-you think they were good times for me? Like when you told Amy Tuttleton, The... the prettiest girl in school, That I had both male and female genitalia? I forgot about that! Yeah, that was classic. "Tuttleton." no. You want me to try "Hermaphrodite"? But now things have changed. - Uh, you clean pools? - I do. I have eight of them. Eight. Well, I should give you one of my cards. No, you don't get it, do you? - I won. - Oh, come on, now. You're not still steamed about stuff that happened 25 years ago? Come on. It's... Listen, you know, it wasn't all bad. Did your brain only remember the painful bits? Just the important stuff. Like what happened in the library. - oh, yeah. Go on. - No, you remember. - I-I was sitting there. - Well... What do we have here? Larry Duberman. Everyone's buzzing about you, Mr. Big man on campus. Who? Doucherman? Come on, you know, he's got, uh, he's got lady parts. You know, you should be talking to me. Drake McIntyre. Well, some people do get finer with age. Well, right back at ya... "Nikki." Got to be kidding me. Guys, um, look. Guys, there's like six Nicoles, Three Veronicas, and a Dominique. This may take a while. Oh, come on, don't tell me you don't remember me without my cheerleading uniform on? - He's also seen me with it off. - Classy. Oh, Nikki, you. Say, why don't you go get us some drinks? And then we'll, uh, we'll reminisce later. It'll be okay. Oh, I'm not letting you out of my sight! Come on. Oh-ho, yeah! Ah, you know, Nikki... Hey, whoa! The, uh... The bar is down there. Why don't we go... - Oh, please. You don't have to get me drunk. - Oh. Ho ho! I don't mean to be insulting or anything, Nikki, but... I'm not sure I have... I'm not sure I have feelings for you anymore. I...I like you, maybe as friends. We'll... Well, if that's the way it's gonna be. Nikki! Nikki! Nikki! I'm sorry! Nikki! Nikki! Nikki, I'm sorry! Nikki, I... Nikki?! Parker, it seems my... Ex-flame has... locked me in the... I don't know... Storage closet or something in the East hallway, so... Wow. You must have really broken her heart. High school is so dramatic! They give trophies for chess. It's the Vezarat. They're coming in! Wait a minute. What are the Iranians doing there? - Thank you, Parker. - Yeah. No problem. Hey, guess what I heard. Huh? A bunch of ladies said Drake McIntyre was the best they ever had. Really? Frank Dinunzio stuffed you in locker 243. Uh, Nikki! Uh, what happened to Drake? Oh, I just wanted him out of the picture, - Aah! - Oh, your dress. I'm so sorry. No, it's fine. It's fine! I've seen worse. You know, you better go wash that off, 'cause that could stain. - No, really, it's... - Uh, Grace... go ahead. We have all evening to catch up. So, did you ever see the girls' locker room? That's where we used to shower after cheerleading practice. What happened? He got away? She took him... that... that-that bloody little slut! All right, calm down, now. No, just because I'm not a cheerleader or something... All right, l-let's forget about her, all right? Eliot has company, and we're no closer to getting the password, - So I think we need to escalate. - Well, you think he's ready? Uh, guys? I've accounted for all the Nikkis of the class of '85. Your Nikki's not even in the yearbook. Okay, so she's a fraud like us? What is she, just some random hussy who's out for his cash? Not exactly. She's a hired gun. An assassin? Yeah, I guess we weren't the only ones with the bright idea to pose as alumni. This chick's connected to wetwork jobs all up and down the East coast. Russian mob, Italian mob, there's a New Zealand mob? All right, this is our fault. I didn't do anything. You know, we lured him to an nonsecured environment. - We exposed him. - And now we have to save him. We can't destroy Manticore with him dead. So split up and find him. Eliot, what's happening on your end? "T" minus five seconds. This reunion sucks! The Health Inspector? I'm gonna have to dock you again. Yeah, Duberman must have pissed off the Iranians. They hire an assassin to take him out while they raid his office? Eliot, you've got to keep 'em away from that computer. What do you think I'm doing?! Checkmate. Or not. Ow! What are you... I'm not getting lucky, am I? Your luck has just run out, Duberman. The Iranians don't care for your negotiating style. Nikki... or whatever your name is... I can double what they're paying you. Oh, I'm sure you could. But that wouldn't look so good for my reputation. Okay, wait! Let's figure out a price here. And by the way...... You're still a nerd. Grace! Oh, thank God! I always hated cheerleaders. Ow! It's mean girls like you that always ruined high school for the rest of us! What the hell are you talking about? Damn it! Duberman! Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, what are you doing? Drake... ho, whoa, hey. Hey, listen, listen. No, no, wait. You locked me in a closet, and you're trying to kill my friend Doucherman here. I'm starting not to like you, there, Nikki. They only paid me to deliver one body, - So get out of my way! - Y-y-y... just wait three seconds. Now, why would I do that? Ohh! That's why. - Catering... what a business. - Drake. Huh? I don't know why, but you just saved me! Eh... You can call me "Doucherman" All you like. Yeah, okay, all right. All right. Tell the truth, you weren't even the cruelest to me in high school. You weren't as bad as Pat Brander. No, no, and where's he tonight to save your ass, huh? - Right? - Right... What are you doing? I just saved your life! - She. - What? Pat Brander. "Patricia." I've already been fooled once tonight. It's not gonna happen again. Who are you? Then who the hell are you? Is anybody here who they say they are? Are you the real Grace Peltz? There is no Grace Peltz. She was a fiction invented to flatter your ego. So you're with that assassin? You're all trying to kill me? No, no, no, we're not trying to kill you, just your business. Yes, on behalf of Cyrus Madavhi... That kid you had beaten and robbed so that you could continue to sell Manticore to Iran. I have no idea what you're talking about. - I'm calling the police. - Well, don't bother. We already did, and they should be on their way just as soon as our man inside your office destroys Manticore using your password. Oh, you couldn't possibly... It was pretty easy to figure out once we got inside this hallway. Zavransky... Mandy double-D, your locker combination? But you're not smart enough. It's changed. - All your work for nothing, fake Drake. - Yeah, it's done. Good to know. Shut up. All right, I'm in. Now what? Okay, good. De-authorize and delete all directories, Just like I showed you. It's done. Manticore is dead. That's not possible. I changed the password. - This is another trick. - Is it? Or is it badger85? That's the new password! But I just changed it! How could you know it?! Well, you know, it turns out, just like high school, you can be pushed around. Neuro-linguistic programming. It's amazing what you can do with the power of suggestion. Say, wasn't that Mrs. Zavransky's room? It's right here on my badge. I wore glasses since I was 8. It wasn't all bad... Did your brain just hold onto all the painful... I already ate. Five months of dieting to fit into this... Badger, badger, badger, badger, '85! Badger, '85! You... you hacked me? You got inside my head?! We did save your life! - What's the matter, Schmitty? - Holy crap! They're out of beer! - Hey, he's got a gun! - FBI! Freeze! No! Let go of me! Nobody move! Stand back! What are you staring at?! I'm better than you. I'm better than all of you! I'm Larry Duberman! Ah, Doucherman. I suppose the FBI received an anonymous tip. Well, yeah, I mean, between the files that Eliot just e-mailed them... And the ledger from the cafe... Duberman's looking at a lot of time in detention. And with Manticore gone, Cyrus' people are one step closer to freedom. I already told Cyrus Manticore's destroyed. I'm sure he's spreading the good news right now. Your votes are in for the king and queen of the reunion! And the lucky winner is... - Grace Peltz and Drake Mcintyre! - Mac attack! Yeah! Uh, very funny, Hardison. Naw, man, I don't rig elections. I mean, I could, but... Parker... Was this you? I didn't even know they had kings and queens in high school. Yeah, um... - Hey, Mac. - I guess it was a good con. Oh, no, I... oh. - Mac attack! Here's your crown! - Oh, thank you. Uh...Hardison, why don't you maybe set off a fire alarm about now? You two enjoy this. You earned it. Grace Peltz and Drake McIntyre. - So, uh... - So, I... Okay. So you think we would have, uh... Been a couple in high school? Mm... Grace Peltz and... the great Drake McIntyre? - Mnh- mnh. Don't think so. - No, no. Nate Ford and... And... And... Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Don't ruin the mood. May I have this dance, miss? So this is what high school was like, huh? Ah... Pretty much. Hello? Everybody having a good time at the dance? Anybody wonder if Eliot made it out? Does anybody wonder if Eliot's alive? Hello?! * Corrections by Linus75 * www.addic7ed.Com Sync by YYeTs.net
