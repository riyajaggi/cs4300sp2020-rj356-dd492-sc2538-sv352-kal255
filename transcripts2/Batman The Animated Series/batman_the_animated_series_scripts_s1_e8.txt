 THEME MUSIC PLAYING Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK CATWOMAN: Previously on Batman... Perfect, my love. Let's go home. BATMAN: So, our new cat burglar is a woman. You see, we're committed to building a major resort. The land is in the middle of nowhere. It's worthless except to wildcats. Tomorrow at 2300 hours, a train under military escort will pass through Gotham. We'll hit the train outside the city, at this point.

 ALARM BEEPING —CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING —What is that? A cat at the end of its nine lives. BATMAN: I'll have to try and trim those claws. Never trifle with the affections of a woman. Until next time. And there will be a next time. —BATMAN: You're late. —GASPS Can't you ever walk up to someone normal—like? BATMAN: I hear you have some information. Under one condition. Lay off the South Side. GASPS Keep this up, and I'll be on you from all sides. North, south, east and west.

 Okay! I get the picture. There's rumors about some train heist. —When? —Tonight. Red Claw? Don't know. It's real sketchy. One thing I can tell you, no one in the organization is making the hit. These are outsiders. GASPS There's nothing here in the schedules. A last—minute change? I'd have been told. What if it was a military train? Something the government wouldn't want us to know about? Wouldn't be the first time. Blasted Feds and their secrets. TRAIN RUMBLING You know, when I saw those army commercials on TV, they never said anything about guarding no plague. Who'd want to steal a can of germs, anyway? EXPLOSION SOLDIERS CLAMORING Huh? BOTH COUGHING ELECTRICITY CRACKLING That's got to do it. BOTH GRUNTING GUNSHOT GRUNTING SCREAMING Red Claw, watch out! Red Claw, a woman? Do you have a problem with that? Not at all. I'm an equal—opportunity crime fighter. RED CLAW: Stay back, Batman! I hold the ultimate equalizer. This plague kills indiscriminately. You'll die, too. Along with everyone else within a 10—mile radius. Can you risk it, Batman? Go on, call my bluff. You've finally met your match, Batman. Not surprising it's a woman. Yes, General, but if you'd warned us about this shipment we might've had a chance. So, what do I do now, evacuate 10 million people? Maybe we can set up camp around the Pentagon. PHONE RINGING Listen, General, I'll call you back. Gordon here. Batman. Thank goodness. Have you heard from Red Claw? GORDON: Loud and clear. We've got 24 hours to come up with $1 billion in gold bullion, or she'II release the plague on Gotham. To think, all this time the Feds have been looking for a man. BRUCE: Lately I'm learning never to underestimate the opposite sex. I'll be in touch. Bruce and Selina go to lunch, take two. I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to seeing you again. Well, this time, I promise a much more exciting date than our last one. Hey. This time you seem preoccupied. Sorry. An unexpected crisis. You, on the other hand, look like the cat who swallowed the canary. Things are going very well on the mountain lion front. I may get that land from Multigon yet. Really? What did you find out? Let's just say, they plan on playing more than shuffleboard up at their resort. CRASHES What in... Watch out! An old boyfriend? Here go your nine lives, kitty—cat. —CRASH ES —BOTH EXCLAIM TIRES SCREECHING —Busy fellow. —What? BRUCE: Nothing. Hang on. TIRES SCREECHING BRAKES SQUEALING CRASHES TIRES SQUEALING HORN HONKING Brace yourself. TIRES SCREECHING GASPS SCREAMING BOTH SCREAMING Where'd you learn to drive like that? BRUCE: Oh, I've been going to the Paris Grand Prix for years. You know, one of these days, I think I'll enter it. BRUCE: Well, you did —promise me an exciting time. —MIRROR SHATTERS It's not every date where I get to fill out police reports. SELINA: Thanks for seeing me up. BRUCE: Just wanted to be sure they didn't try anything else. What makes you think they weren't after you? A nice guy like me? CHUCKLES Good night, Bruce. Selina, if you're in some kind of trouble, I wish you'd tell me. Perhaps I can help. I really care about you. I haven't felt this way in a long, long time. Thanks, Bruce. But I've never been able to play the damsel in distress. I'll be okay. Don't worry. MAVEN: But, why would someone at Multigon try to kill you? SELINA: Ten to one, it has to do with those bunkers under their resort site. I think it's time I do some digging. ISIS MEOWS Not this time, Isis. I'm afraid where I'm going, they don't allow pets. ALFRED: It's not that I question your instincts, sir, but why would Red Claw wish to harm Ms. Kyle? BRUCE: Why, indeed. But somehow, Selina has crossed Red Claw's path, and I mean to find out where. What an unusual color. Ms. Kyle's, I presume. SNIFFS No. It's a cat hair. Curious, never seen one quite that color. Batman has. GASPS YELLS MAVEN: GASPS Get away! GROWLS Huh? BLOWS LANDING SCREAMS I won't hurt you. Red Claw is after you and Catwoman. Catwoman? What are you talking about? Maven, you must tell me where she's gone. These people are killers. STAMMERS The Multigon site. You're not safe here anymore. Is there somewhere you can hide? Well, I guess I could go—— WHISPERS Shh. Go quickly. As long as you know who she is, you should know how she feels. She's in love with you. —WHIP SWISHING —GASPS GRUNTING This ought to keep you out of my hair. —GROWLING —SHUSHES CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING These will certainly enhance the resort's brochure. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. SNICKERS I didn't think you cared. BATMAN: Come on! You've got to get out of here. CATWOMAN: Me? What about you? There's something I have to pick up. Welcome to my little resort. Plan on a short stay. BOTH STRUGGLING It's never dull, is it, Batman? You may be surprised to know these accommodations are courtesy of your government. They built this top—secret facility to shelter high officials in case of a nuclear incident. Since you wanted the plague so badly, Batman, we've decided to give it to you. What will you use to blackmail Gotham if you waste it on us? Why risk carrying such deadly contents, when a placebo will do? By the time they realize the vial is a fake, we'll be miles away with their billion dollars. SIZZLING The acid should eat through in a matter of minutes. Sound evacuation, and begin sealing the compound. We wouldn't want the plague to harm the precious wildlife, just the vermin in here. Ugh. Would I like to get my claws into them. If I could just get some slack... What this situation needs is a woman's touch. ALARM BLARING STRAINING What a team. Come on! ALARM CONTINUES BLARING You've got to get out of here. Not without you. I'll be right behind you. But first, I've got to destroy the plague. Now go! Please. RED CLAW GASPS YELLS ANGRILY Batman. GASPS OVER PA This is Police Commissioner Gordon. You're completely surrounded. Give yourselves up. Right where Batman said they'd be. Looks like this resort is folding. CATWOMAN GROANS RED CLAW: So are you. For years, I've fought to build my network. I brought countries to their knees. You will pay, pussycat. GROANS You will learn why everyone fears Red Claw. ROARING Thank you, friend. Something for you to remember me by. Hmm. BLOWS KISS Batman, where's the virus? It went up in smoke, with Red Claw's future. I should've known you'd have it all wrapped up before we got here. Almost. Maven? Maven? She's gone. The terrorists were after both of you. Have you told the police you found your cat burglar? BATMAN: Not yet. CATWOMAN: Why not? I didn't want you taken away like a common criminal. So, you do care. HANDCUFFS CLICKING More than you will ever know. THEME MUSIC PLAYING English — SDH
