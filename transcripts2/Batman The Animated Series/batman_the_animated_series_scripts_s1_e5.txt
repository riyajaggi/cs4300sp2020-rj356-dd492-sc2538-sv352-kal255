I'll have to find a way to get lots of this stuff on my own. I think our Mr. Hagen has outlived his usefulness. I want him dealt with. —HAGEN: No. —Sweet dreams, slimeball.

 Bell said he didn't know. He had to be lying. But I know where to get the truth. HAGEN: Move it, Lupus. I want all this stuff out of here by sunrise. Ah, Matt, come on, you don't have to do this. You made a comeback before. You can do it again. Comeback? Comeback? From this? Face it, Teddy, Matt Hagen is history. This time, for good. He's never coming back again. GERMS: My contact on the force says Bell hasn't cracked, so far. Good. Well, I'm afraid we still have quite a mess to clean up. Sooner or later, I will take control of Wayne Enterprises. Their marketing operation will instantly give me a distribution network that would take me years to build on my own. Till then, my takeover plan will have to be revised. Now that our actor friend, Hagen, is no longer available to us. Okay, Mr. Daggett, who do you want me to take out now? I want everything wrapped up by the time I tape that show tonight. We're going to settle the Fox matter once and for all. But, Mr. Daggett, he's in a hospital. All those sick people... Okay, Mr. Daggett. But, Matt, you thought it was all over for you once before, and you were wrong then. You know, when you had your accident. Of course I thought it was over. I figured I was lucky to be alive. Just like I thought I was when Daggett came to Visit me at his clinic of his, asking me to be his first test subject. How could I say no? He told me his Renuyu formula could do in minutes what plastic surgery would take years to accomplish. It wasn't so bad, except for all those jobs you had to do for him in return. But, hey, it worked. I mean, you had your biggest hits after the accident. Yeah. Some of the best parts I ever had. Matt! You're changing. And you didn't use your hands this time. You didn't even try. You did it automatically, like a reflex or something. Unbelievable. You know what this means, don't you? It doesn't have to be over. You can go on. We can go on. Wow! You can even form clothes out of your skin. But, how? The formula must've soaked every cell in my body. It's... It's some kind of miracle. —What... What are you doing? —No. No. You broke my concentration! It won't work, don't you see? It's too hard. It's like tensing a muscle. I can't keep it up for long. My career, my life... It is gone! And I can never get it back! CRASHING I'm not an actor anymore. I'm not even a man. SOBBING HAGEN: Pull in here. TEDDY: The hospital? Sooner or later, Daggett will send someone to finish off Fox. Once I know who it is, I can take his place. And if Daggett thinks I'm his henchman, I can walk right up to him and, IIBam!II Goodbye, Mr. Daggett. CHUCKUNG CRIES OUT —GASPS —Hey! GASPS GASPS Let me out of here. Please. All these viruses and bacteria, I could be infected. I know. Now, the man who impersonated Bruce Wayne, I want his name. I, uh, I don't know who, uh... Hmm. Crimson fever. Lousy way to go. No cure, you know. The name. Now! Okay, okay, it was Hagen. Matt Hagen, the movie actor. It's the truth. I swear! Then, how did he fool Fox? He's good, but no actor, no makeup, is that good. I... I don't know. You're crazy! Last chance. —Ta|k! —All right. He had something. Something nobody else had. He could... MAN: Nice going, Batman. But I'll take it from here. —This is my collar. —Just a moment. GRUNTS What in the name of... Shut up. SCREAMING MUFFLED SCREAMING MUFFLED SCREAMING Relax, Germs. You won't have to hang around here too long. MUFFLED SCREAMING What in the name of heaven... Back off! GRUNTING Huh? GRUNTING GROANING All that shape—changing takes a lot out of you, doesn't it? POLICE SIRENS WAILING MUFFLED SOBBING Tomorrow on Gotham Insider, my guest will be pharmaceutical king, Roland Daggett, whose new product can perform miracles even plastic surgery can't. Not even the Batman can stop me, Teddy. And that means, Daggett won't have a prayer. Matt, please. You don't want to do anything crazy. Why don't you try to get some shuteye? GROWLS Don't you dare patronize me! I told you, I don't need rest. I don't need food! And I don't need you! GRUNTS Ah! ALFRED: I've acquired the Matt Hagen films you requested, sir. Good, because now I'm sure that that thing I fought at the hospital is Hagen. His condition is apparently the tragic result of an experiment conducted by Roland Daggett. Hagen apparently transforms, unconsciously sometimes, like a reflex action. PEOPLE CHATTERING APPLAUSE FEMALE ANCHOR: A face—lift in ajar? —I love that idea. That's interesting. —PEOPLE MURMURING IN AGREEMENT If you'll watch the monitors, you'll see that with Renuyu, you can smooth away wrinkles, reshape imperfections. Literally, remake your face however you choose. —Oh, that's great! —Yeah. ALL MURMURING Amazing stuff, RoIIy. see we have some questions in our audience. I'd like to ask Mr. Daggett about the rumors I've heard. I hear he's selling Renuyu through direct marketing because stores won't carry it due to its harmful side effects. Well, that's, uh... Absolutely untrue. What about the addictive properties of Renuyu, Mr. Daggett? How, once you're hooked on it, you can't stop using it without horrible pain? No. I mean... That's just not so. Why don't you show them what an overdose can do, Daggett. VOICE CHANGING Why don't you tell them about me? PEOPLE SCREAMING PEOPLE SCREAMING GROWLING 4GUNSCOCKNG —Huh? BOTH: Huh? GRUNTS GRUNTS GRUNTS You again. Hagen, listen to me. There is no Hagen. It's only me now, Clayface. YELLING YELLING GROWLING GRUNTS LAUGHING See? I figured out how to manage this thing pretty good. LAUGHING GRUNTS GRUNTS LAUGHING PANTING GASPS GASPS GASPS What are you doing? Stop it! Look at them, Hagen. Look at what you used to be. No. No. Turn them off. You can play those roles again, Hagen. Let me help you find a cure. No! Hagen's gone. Make him stop haunting me! GRUNTING SCREAMING Stop it. Stop it. Turn them off. I can't control it. I can't be all of them. Not all at once. SCREAMING Stop! GRUNTING SCREAMING Mother of mercy. It looks just like Bruce Wayne. SCREAMING You know what I'd have given for a death scene like this? Too bad I won't get to... Read the notices. I'm just glad to know it wasn't really Bruce Wayne who attacked me. Thank you, Mr. Fox. All charges against Wayne have, of course, been dropped. And Roland Daggett remains in custody. BATMAN: Mmm. ALFRED: My word, sir. I should think after all this, it would be time to rest. Look. A piece of clay left behind when they took Hagen's body away. Watch. Electricity has no effect on it? BATMAN: Exactly. I wouldn't be surprised if the body they took to the morgue was only a shell. Don't forget, first and foremost, Hagen was an actor. He said it himself, Alfred, he called it a scene. Maybe the greatest scene of his career. See you around, Matt. A death scene so real, it fooled us all. LAUGHING LAUGHING IN HAGEN'S VOICE THEME MUSIC PLAYING English — SDH
