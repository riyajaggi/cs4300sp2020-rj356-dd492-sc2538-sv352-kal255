 (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK (TRAIN APPROACHING) (DOOR BUZZING) It's about time. (DOOR BUZZING) Good morning, Hill. - Oh, good morning, um... - Fugate. Temple Fugate? I should think you'd remember the name by now, Counselor. We've only been taking the same train every day for...

 One year, seven months and 13 days. Right. The efficiency expert. Six minutes behind schedule. You seem pretty tightly wound this morning, Fugate. I have an important court hearing today. There's been a $20 million judgment against my company. My attorney has appealed. But if we lose, it's the end of everything. Temple, let me give you some advice. I'm a lawyer. Trust me, I know these things. If that judge sees you looking as tense and haggard as you are now, he'll think you were up to something.

 Loosen up. Do something to relax before you go into court. Get out of your routine for a few minutes. Do you take a coffee break? Of course. Every day, at 3:00 on the dot. Then take it at 3:15. But... My schedule. Forget your schedule for one day. Believe me, it will make a new man out of you. (TYPING) I needed those five minutes ago. I'm sorry, sir, but... Thirty-seven pages? That would take a copier exactly one minute and 49 seconds. One more delay like this and you're fired. Your coffee, sir. And those court documents you requested. MAYOR HILL: Take your coffee break at 3:15. And get out of the office. Put that in a thermos, Ms. Perkins. (BALL BOUNCING) (SIGHS DEEPLY) Aah! (CHILDREN LAUGHING) You little brats! (GASPING) No! No! Don't do this to me! My lawyer needs those papers. (DOG BARKS) Due to his failure to appear, this court finds your client in default. Summary judgment against him stands, at $20 million. No! You can't! I'll be ruined! Then perhaps this will teach you to be on time for a change. (TICKING CLOCK ECHOES) (SCREAMING) (CLOCK TICKING) (TIRES SCREECHING) Are you quite sure you won't stop for breakfast, Master Bruce? The meals they serve at these fundraisers... Mmm, ghastly. BRUCE: Alfred, I'm sure Mayor Hill will put out a good spread. He knows you don't kick off a reelection campaign by poisoning your supporters. Really? If he were in a hurry to get to the food, he'd be ahead of us instead of behind us. (CRASHING) (HORNS HONKING) I take it taxi drivers are no longer required to obey traffic signals. Climb off it, geezer. You had the red. BRUCE: It's nobody's fault. Look. The traffic signals are malfunctioning. What the devil? MAN: That is rude! It's the same thing all the time. (PEOPLE ARGUING) MAN 2: I'll sue you. There's the foul-up. Mayor Over-the-Hill. Nothing works right in this city no more. I fear this does not bode well for his campaign. No. No, it doesn't. And that may be exactly the point. (EXPLOSION) (CROWD GASPING) (CROWD LAUGHING) Another piece of outlandish graffiti? Is this somebody's idea of a joke? BATMAN: Hold it! Well, well. The Batman. It's about time you showed up. I suppose you want to know why I've brought downtown Gotham to a standstill, Batman. Hmm? Well, let's just say it's because I'm a civic-minded citizen with a lot of time on his hands. (EXPLOSION) I want some answers, wise guy. Talk! A pity. I don't know what to tell you, Batman. Except, perhaps that the 9:15 is always six minutes early. (TIRES SCREECHING) BATMAN: If the creep with the clocks did sabotage the entire traffic system, he had to have come here to do it. Wait here. (BATC LAW CLICKING) My pleasure. This is one of the finest back alleys in all of Gotham. BATMAN: What kind of saboteur uses a $6,000 Metronex to trigger a time bomb? A saboteur with too much money? Most jewelry stores register the serial numbers of the Metronexes they sell. Let's see what the police database turns up. "Temple Fugate. 362 Brayfogle." Let's go, Alfred. It appears Mr. Fugate's neighborhood has seen better days. (CLOCKS TICKING) (RADIO STATIC) BATMAN: What is it about that particular clock tower? He's got more data on it than anything else in the city. ALFRED: There's been a slight blackout. Just one city block, between Schiff and Robinson, west of Molldorf. BATMAN: The location of Gotham Mutual's main branch. No doubt some malefactors blacked out the bank, to disable the locks on the vault. Yes, the time locks. - Fugate. - Fugate. (TIRES SCREECHING) (TIMER BUZZING) (SLAMS) (TAPE CLICKING) FUGATE ON TAPE". Sorry I couldn't be with you in person, Batman. But, I've got a train to catch. This box contains a high-speed vacuum pump. I know you've got all kinds of gas masks. So, I'm putting you out of my misery by simply removing all the oxygen from the room. The process will take 15 minutes, which is exactly 17 minutes less than the time it would take you to burn through the door with that oxyacetylene torch of yours. Oh, and, I don't recommend trying to open the pump's housing. It's rigged with a vibration-sensitive explosive. Of course, if you want to get blown to bits, that's fine with me. Either way, it's time to say adieu, Batman. (BAND PLAYING) This magnificent station, home of the world's first fully-automated subway line, is the fulfillment of my pledge to you, (SIGNAL BELL CLANGING) to make our subways safer and more efficient. And so, I declare Gotham Central Station officially open. (CROWD CHEERING) (BAND PLAYING) Let the first train arrive! (CROWD LAUGHING) WOMAN: (LAUGHING) Where is it? (WHEEZING) WOMAN: What an embarrassment. I wanted that train here at 2:30 on the dot! FUGATE'. So, is this what you want? A mayor who can't even get a single subway train to arrive on time? (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) (CROWD CHATTERING) FUGATE'. Clear the platform, please. Here comes some more of our mayor's incompetence. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (ALL GASPING) (CROWD CLAMORING) (TRAIN CRASHING) (CROWD SHOUTING) Only minor injuries. Thank God. Hill! Where's Hill? (GROANING) (GRUNTING) (EXPLOSION) (GROANING SOFTLY) And in the wake of the subway accident, this grim news, Mayor Hamilton Hill has vanished. The police have no leads to his whereabouts and they fear he may have been kidnapped. (CLOCK CHIMING) (WIND HOWLING) FUGATE: Comfortable, Hill? Well, you won't be for long. At 3:15 on the dot, those hands will come together, and you'll be crushed like an insect. 3:15, Hill. Does that time hold any meaning for you? I don't know what you're talking about! You told me to take my coffee break at 3:15. - What? - You don't remember? My court date? Oh, my Lord! The lawsuit! Fugate, I swear, I was only trying to help. FUGATE: Don't hand me that. You did it on purpose. The plaintiffs were represented by your law firm, Mr. Mayor. (LIGHTNING CRASHES) But I had nothing to do with that case, Fugate. Liar! Not that it matters anymore, now that you have an appointment to keep at 3:15 precisely, with the grim reaper! (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (GASPS) I'm here to clean your clock, Fugate. FUGATE: Don't count on it, Batman. When it comes to clocks, I am king. En garde! (GRUNTS) Huh? Whoa! (GRUNTS) (LIGHTNING CRASHES) Give it up, Fugate. Hill committed no crime against you. He did worse. He made me late! (GROANING) (GRUNTING) (GROANS) FUGATE: I could do this all day, Batman, but your time is up. (BATMAN GRUNTS) (GROANING) FUGATE: I've studied news footage of you. And I know that it takes you exactly 1/20 of a second to throw a punch. BATMAN: Very clever. But it only takes me 1/30 of a second to do this. (coes GROANING) (POWERING DOWN) (WHIMPERING) Huh? (SIGHS) (GEARS CREAKING) (GRUNTS) Fugate! You can't escape! Au contraire, Batman. You of all people should know there's always a way out. (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Fugate! (GASPING) (GRUNTS) (MAYOR HILL SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) (INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER) GORDON: Well, he won't be doing any more campaigning for a few days. But at least the Mayor is safe. BATMAN: No trace of this Clock King, though. GORDON: How could anyone survive a wreck like this? BATMAN: If I could, he could. Then, you think we'll hear from him again? I wouldn't be surprised, Commissioner. In fact, I'd say, it's only a matter of time. (CLOCK TICKING) (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) English - SDH
