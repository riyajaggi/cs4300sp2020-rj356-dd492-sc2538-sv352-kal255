 This door will hold, it's solid. Yes, keeping them out there and us in here. They get more frenzied when they see us. It'll make those bastards break through even quicker. We need that walkie. I cannot continue doing this any longer. I had unwavering faith in Tyagi ma'am. I thought she was a good officer. I followed her orders blindly. This has all been a lie - this detonator proves it.

 I should have seen through her before. Tyagi ma'am ordered me to kill a small child. But you didn't kill her... did you, Sirohi uncle? Look, this place is dangerous. Go that way. And run as fast as you can and don't look back. Go. Because you are not like her. Do you know what you are? A hero. Bhunnu... I was wrong to follow Mudhalvan and Tyagi. But Tyagi is under his influence. He was sitting on her.

 I saw him gripping her tightly... and whispering something in her ear. Colonel Lynedoch. It's time that Tyagi and I have a little chat. Tyagi, you know, we won't give Saanvi up to the Colonel. Is there any other way to stop him? There was a time... when you used to be a good officer. When they wrote an article on you, your mother called me. She was weeping about you being called a hero and that made her proud. Are you still... a good soldier, Sirohi... or not? I am a good soldier. Then be my soldier. Follow my command. Be a good soldier. Let me command you. Take me from this woman. You are much stronger than her. Carry me on your shoulder and together we will take this girl where she rightfully belongs. Will you carry me? - Will you carry me? - No. Willingly? - Vikram uncle. - Sirohi? Vikram uncle. Sirohi? - Will you carry me? - Vikram uncle. Yes, I will. Sirohi Uncle. Sirohi Sir! - I told you he is very dangerous. - One minute. How dare you? Shoot both of them, Sirohi. Kill them! Tyagi is totally under his control. I was weakening, too. We thought we had lost you there. You should have shot her. No. I am not a murderer. I can't kill anyone else. I can't be a murderer. Do you think she's the only one in the forest? You think there aren't more out there to be found? They have spread through the forest already. Sooner or later, they will find what they're looking for. The Colonel will get his sacrifice - Saanvi or someone else. And once he escapes this cursed mountain, the entire country will fall to his power. I don't think that the door will hold for long. Neither will this. Hey! Pick it up. Quick! Sirohi? Come in, Sirohi. Come in, Sirohi. Sirohi, come in. Sirohi here. Please, come in. Vikram... we don't have more than five minutes. Come fast, brother. OK, stay there. I'm coming. They are screwed. We can't reach them. We're stuck here. I have an idea. - This used to be an armory. - So what? Before I became Mr. Mudhalvan's... I mean, his... Lapdog. Yes, before becoming his lapdog, I was the top student of my class. I was very famous. Everyone knew me. I was the most popular in my Engineering batch. Why are you telling me this? I was popular because I could fix anything. - Anything? - Anything. Let's do it. Set me free, Sirohi, and give them what they want. They are leaving. This is what you call a hard Brexit, motherfuckers. Sit tight, Akbar. We are coming for you. - And Tyagi ma'am? - She is with her own kind. There will be more on the way. Quick! Come on. Hey, Lynedoch! Hey, Lynedoch! Your work happened... the army is inside now. I kept my promise. Time for your promise now. Remember, I am not like the rest. If you try to cheat me, I'll fuck you, whether you're dead or alive, motherfucker. Come to me, Mudhalvan. Come to me. Come to me. Come to me. We have to hurry. They are coming - a lot of them. Hurry, Saanvi! They are going to come through. Fuck! - Vikram. - Come on. We don't have time. Let's go. I am sorry, man. Ahlu... was a hero. Before we get out, there's something I must do. What? Put an end to that thing in the tunnel. What thing? Their commanding officer. While he's in command, he's a threat to the entire nation. Will you guys follow me? I'll help. Me too. I know a way. There's a large hall, used for gatherings. We must get there. I've some things that might be helpful to us. Switch off the lights. Everyone, stay absolutely silent. Let's move. Torch off! Sir... Sir, this way is the fastest. This one. OK. It's very dark ahead. Saanvi... consider this as a game. Everyone is a number from now on. I am one. You're two. Bhunnu is three, Puniya is four and Akbar is five. Whenever I say my number, you say yours. This will help us to know that we're together. OK? One. Two. Three. Four. Five. OK. Let's move. One. - Two. - Three. - Four. - Five. Six. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. - Stay close. - What happened, Sirohi? Everyone, come close to me. Everyone, stay close. Sirohi! Everyone stay close. Together. Soldiers, step back. Good that you found us. Sirohi, stop! Sir. Ahlu... I wanted to say something to you. You were always right about Tyagi ma'am. I should have listened to you earlier. Sirohi... Sirohi... I am sorry. Sirohi... I am sorry, Ahlu. I am sorry. I thought you were a goner. I had made a promise. I was not going to let her down again. It's 4:30 a.m. CM's security squad will be here any moment. We have to stop these creatures before they reach any other settlement. Stay alert. Betaal wants us to hand over this child to him. I'll fill this effigy with explosives. Then take it inside pretending it's this child, and we'll give this to Betaal who is yearning for her. What a fucking stupid plan. Do you have a better one? No, right? Assholes, first of all, you hide explosives in here and then you ask why we patrol your areas. The truth is, I've been waiting for the moment that your special Baaz Force comes here and we could finish you. You think you can kill us? - You want to see. - Hey! Akbar. We will do as she says. Baaz Squad... Baaz Squad, come in. Give us your location. This is Charlie Delta Company, CM's security advanced detail. We're arriving shortly. This is second IC Vikram Sirohi. Wherever you are, stop. Don't move ahead. Baaz Squad, come in. Anyone there? I repeat. Don't move forward. They will get themselves killed. The CM's team needs to be warned, and we need their vehicles. Before these monsters find them... you two must find and alert them. And as soon as the coast is clear, you must get out of here along with Saanvi. Where is Baaz Squad? And you? I need to make a delivery. There they are. Sir, be careful. They are not moving. They could be anything. - Hey! Why are you sneaking around? - What happened? - Who's that? - Who is she? Why are you sneaking around? Help! Get in! We need something to wrap this with. I saw some clothes hanging outside. I'll go get those. This can kill two at the most. I am not going to sit here and wait to die. If all goes to plan... this doll will look exactly like you. Vikram uncle... Give me Saanvi. Give her to me. Enough is enough. Saanvi. Get back. Face the wall and cover your ears. - But Vikram uncle... - Go! Commandant Tyagi... is it you... or only Lynedoch who lives in your bodynow? Don't do it, Vikram. You made me do unlawful things for your own interest. But that's not your fault. You were just following orders like a good soldier. You are a good soldier, Sirohi. You are a good soldier, Vikram. Vikram uncle, don't fall into her trap. Shoot her, uncle! Shoot her! - Now, let me command you. - Ignore her, Vikram uncle. Kill her! Shoot her, Vikram uncle. Shoot her! What now, motherfuckers? They are retreating, sir. Hey! Hey! Puniya! Puniya! Puniya, come back! What are you doing? Come back! Didn't he wake up? Even if he does, there's not much of him left. Thank God my unit didn't have to face you. Then you'd have surely died at my hands. Where are the rest? He let me go. He let me go. Lynedoch used me and left me. I thought I was a good soldier. I thought I was right. - I failed. - No! The effigy! It's still here! So, if the Colonel let Tyagi ma'am go, then... Where are you taking me? Please, Vikram uncle. Let me go! Please! Let me go! Where are we going? Listen to me, Vikram uncle! Please, no! Do your duty, Sirohi! Be a good soldier! We'll take this girl where she rightfully belongs. I am a good soldier! Let me go! Do your duty. Please, Vikram uncle! What happened to you? Vikram uncle, please, let me go! Vikram uncle, please. Listen to me! I am a good soldier. No! Please, no! No! What shall we do now? I should go back to my family. - What? - I must keep them safe. I've no one left. I should never have come here. This was never my battle. Sir, this is our battle now. Not mine. I am sorry. Forgive me. Fine. If you won't do your duty and fail to protect your country and its people... then someone will have to do your job. - You are crazy. - Yes. Good luck. Coward. Vikram uncle, please, leave me alone. Why are you behaving like this? Please, Vikram uncle. Please! Listen to me! Vikram uncle! Please! Leave me be! So much wealth, so much power. Daddy! Daddy, help me! Daddy, please, help me! - Kill her, Sirohi! Kill her! - No! Daddy, help me, please! Leave me. I don't want to go! - Kill her, Sirohi! - Daddy, help me! Kill her. So much power... No, Vikram uncle. Please, no. No, Vikram uncle, no. No, Vikram uncle! Vikram uncle! Vikram uncle, please, don't do this. You don't have to do this! - Kill her. - Don't listen to him. Kill her for me. It's not me, Saanvi. It's you. It's your hand. It's your knife. - It's someone else. - Kill her. You said you'd help me. That little girl, you didn't obey orders then. Don't obey now! - Please. - Kill the girl. Please, don't do this. - Even Ahlu ma'am said I could trust you. - Don't do this, Sirohi! No one's forcing you, Vikram uncle. - No. - No. - This is wrong. - No. Vikram, don't do this. You know it's wrong! Please, don't do this! I am... - Vikram... - Kill the girl! I'm Vikram Sirohi. I won't let anything happen to you. I won't do this. Saanvi, I am sorry. I am sorry. I won't do it. I won't do it. I am sorry. I won't do it. Tell her... what kind of man... you are. We were told... that Naxals were gathering in the jungle. We reached there and attacked them... and eradicated the entire group. I found an innocent child. She was looking for her mother. Mom! She was a witness. - Sirohi, you know what you need to do. - But ma'am... She was so innocent. Like this one. Yes. Just like Saanvi. And then what did you do? No. Please, Vikram uncle. No! No! Look, this place is dangerous. Go that way. Run as fast as you can and don't look back. OK? I... - I... - You followed orders. You did your duty. Only your duty. No. - Yes, soldier. - No. - No. - Yes. Don't question your actions. Tyagi Ma'am, clear. You followed orders. Follow one more. One more. Forgive me. - No. - Forgive me, Saanvi. I lied to you. It was my fault. Fire! It was all my fault. I am a murderer. I killed them. I am responsible for all those deaths. Me! Only me! Only me! Shall we? Motherfuckers, move! Move! Suck my dick, motherfuckers! Move! Saanvi, run! Saanvi! Detonator! Run out of here and press the button! Your father has the bomb! - Saanvi. - Saanvi! Press the button! I can't do this! It'll kill you both! Don't press the button, Saanvi. Saanvi, press the button! Please, Sirohi uncle, no! Saanvi, surrender to the Colonel! Don't press the button. Press the button. I am ordering you. Come in. This is Baaz Squad for 34GMD. I repeat. This is Baaz Squad for 34GMD. Can anyone hear me? - We're under attack. - Is there anyone? Attacks are coming from all angles. Come in. We need armed support. What the fuck? What the fuck is going on? Can anyone read me? Back up. We need back up! We are under armed assault. I repeat. We are under armed assault. Can anyone read me? "The shrine must not under any circumstances be destroyed." The shrine contains the raw powers of the Betaal. If this vessel is tampered... the curse of Betaal will be unleashed across the land. All those who died at the time of Betaal's summoning will rise up from the dead... "and attack the living!" They have infiltrated the building. Dressed weirdly. - But, brother... - Wait a minute. Saanvi, put on the news channel quickly. - OK. - Any one! Hurry up! - Are we live? - Can anyone read me? Reports of attacks are coming from all around the country, though nothing has been confirmed as yet. But the question is, if these reports are true, who is responsible for these attacks? Who is attacking this free country without any provocation?
