 Tread silently outside the tunnel. Let nothing disturb their sleep. For Betaal's curse has destroyed them, and they will be hungry when they wake. Oh Lord of the Underworld... we're under your refuge, accept our reverence. We request you to keep your slumber and our peace intact. Accept this small offering, Lord Betaal. We pray that you stay calm. Hail Betaal Dev! Hail Betaal Dev! Glory to the Spirit God.

 Glory to the Spirit God. Outsiders are coming to take our mountains from us. We won't let them come here and destroy us. There's something wrong with Aunty, we should stop. Aunty, tell us what you saw? Tell us. Aunty, what happened? Are you OK, Aunty? Cover the idol. Fast! Hurry up! Don't let them open the tunnel! Don't let them open it. It should remain closed. Keep it closed! Keep it closed! Keep it closed!

 The British did us a big favor by building most of the tunnel. Their construction skills were a cut above the rest, but once we finish this tunnel, Surya Constructions will be a force to be reckoned with. We'll see. Saanvi, leave that alone. It's dirty. What happened to them, Mom? They were sacrifices to save us from the wrath of the demons. I have to leave in an hour, Mr. Mudhalvan. Of course. The workers will be here any minute. "This monument was erected in order to commemorate..." - Mother. - Yes? - "Lieutenant Colonel John Lynedoch..." - "John Lynedoch..." - "...of the 90th Taunton Volunteers." - "...Taunton Volunteers." Meaning? This place served as a safe haven for rebels. When the independence war broke out in 1857, many British died at this place. Good for us. Good riddance. Sir. - What? - There's been a problem, sir. We won't let this happen! We won't allow a road to be built here! - You promised the CM a deadline, remember? - Of course, I do, sir. But these people are making things very difficult for us. We're facing a slight delay. Actually... Another one sabotaged. - That's the third one this week... - It's a machine, they break down. The CM is supposed to come down this Friday in order to inaugurate this famous tunnel. And if work gets delayed anymore, and if the monsoon sets in... Give me 24 hours. I won't let the monsoons interfere with my plans. - I'll take care of them. - We cannot afford any more delays. Do whatever it takes, but just get it done. My responsibility. You promised him, but what about these tribals? What tribals? They're all Naxals and soon everyone will know it. Welcome to Citizen Network. Our topic for today's debate is, "Should the CIPD be held accountable for civilian deaths in Campa forest?" We have Professor Rahim with us. He's the professor of International Relations, Central University. So, Professor, what's your take on this? You're just forcing helpless tribal communities out of their own homes using titles like "Operation Clean Sweep." Are you trying to say, Professor, people who are cut-off from civilization don't deserve a shot at development and progress? How can removing poor residents from their mineral rich lands be termed as development? - Don't term this charade as "development." - You're just beating around the bush. The only people who are benefitting from this are private companies like Surya Development. - They're making a lot of money... - Listen. - Please, answer the question. - But also corrupting people like you. You are liberal left-wing scum. We are joined by Commandant Tyagi, Baaz Squad, CIPD. Are you questioning the integrity of the Indian CIPD? Let me tell you something, Professor. Whenever the country needed us, we've fought with our lives. It was us who marched into battle with the likes of. Mangal Pandey, Bhagat Singh, and Subhash Chandra Bose. We hold our ground, caring less about ourselves so pseudo-intellectuals like yourself can sleep peacefully. Because, as you know very well, we would give our lives before any harm comes to the people or to this nation. Love you, Tyagi, ma'am. Love you! Now, I have a question for you, Professor. If you have so many complaints against our country and our government, then, when Jinnah gave you the chance, why didn't you get the f♪♪♪ back to P♪♪♪? Yeah! Awesome! Shut up. What? - Always giving examples of your ideals. - Amazing! Even the credit for our country's independence goes to her now. Amazing, Tyagi ma'am. Wow! Superb. Tyagi ma'am is an exceptional officer. Just you wait, Ahlu. Someday, I will be just like her. Yes, of course. After all, she is your idol. You will even jump in a well for her doing a back-flip. And you won't? Isn't it strange how people like us fight for the rights of people like you? Those rights that give you the power to accuse us falsely. I'm not complaining, Professor... because this is our duty. OPERATION SAMEER NIWAS ENCOUNTER: TRIBALS ALLEGE THAT VILLAGERS KILLED BY CIPD SQUAD WERE NOT NAXALS. Sirohi, come in. Do you read me? Fake news. Listen... what went down at Sameer Niwas... if you need to talk, I am always available. I hope you do know that. Sir. Nadir Haq, new recruit. Hello. - Welcome to the Baaz Squad. - Very proud to be here, sir. Let me introduce you. Deputy Commandant Ahluwalia. Hello, ma'am. Look me in the eye when you're talking to me. I am not your mother. Asshole. Sorry, ma'am. - Sir? - Yes? You're my hero, sir. I've been collecting articles for a long time now. Ever since I first read about you, my only goal was that I wanted to be like you. There's an article about you too, sir. Local Braveheart. Home-grown hero. Now, I've seen it all. I've been explaining this to him since we were kids. Those who try to be heroes go straight up to heaven. But I am still around. I know, but for how long? This is my cousin-brother, Nadir Haq. He has a lot to learn and it is my job to teach him. And you... trying to impress him on your first day? And by the way, not everything you read... in the papers is true. Exactly. I've been trying to explain this to Sirohi for a while. OPERATION SAMEER NIWAS ENCOUNTER Don't go down this road, Sirohi. It leads to a dark place. For the sake of the team and the country's safety, we're often compelled to make snap decisions. Yes, ma'am. It's the media's job to write this trash. They'll never understand our sacrifices. We often have to bend the rules to ensure the success of our operation. We are working in the best interest of everyone. Correct? And for that, the end justifies the means. Do you get me? Yes, ma'am. Good. Ma'am, everyone was overjoyed to see you on TV. A load of nonsense. Now, this... Nilja Village. It's a part of modern India... but the inhabitants are devoid of even the most basic amenities. The nearby forest hides old British military barracks, which are now in ruins. The elders of the village have been living there for years. These jungles are occupied by Naxals and they don't want this place to develop. You know, Sirohi, there's only one way to sanitize a disturbed area - connecting it with civilization. Our mission is... providing Campa with its first highway... which will usher development into this area. So, our job will be providing a road-opening party. Correct. - Hello, Mr. Mudhalvan. - Hello. Sirohi, we need your help urgently. These Naxals have been a pain in the ass. We need this tunnel opened in 24 hours and to get rid of these meddling terrorists or whoever they are. Clear them out. Open this tunnel. That is your responsibility. No need to worry, Mr. Mudhalvan. Our team won't take long to fix this problem. Thank you. The loyalty you displayed at Sameer Niwas mission, we'll be expecting the same dedication from you, Sirohi. Is that clear, Sirohi? Yes. Yes, ma'am. One more thing. I just received news that if we've another successful mission, he'll be stepping into my shoes. That's great. And you two can continue to work together for many years to come. Of course. Thank you, ma'am. - Dismissed. - Jai Hind. Goodbye, sir. Can we trust him? We'll take care of it. Hey... are you OK? Yes. T-minus five minutes. Ready, boys? - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! We are here... for your own protection. We will help you evacuate from this location... and relocate you. And it is in your best interests, your family's, your community's, and the country's... because this work is being done for the development of this country. And anyone who doesn't follow our instructions... will be considered Naxal and be arrested immediately. It is our will to save you from the injustices of the Naxals. Tyagi madam, I've heard that you've hiked your service fee. Unfortunately, Mr. Mudhalvan, it's a competitive market out there. So, I would request... that you cooperate with us peacefully. We won't let any road be built here! Touch our land and it won't be good for you! Get out of here! - Pigs will never learn! - Stone them! Charge! Check inside. Drag them out. Puniya, listen to me. Forget those things and come with me. This is not the solution to our problem. If not now, when? Only as our last resort. What now? Get them out of here. Move ahead! Take them! Greetings, Aunty. We need your advice right now. Aunty, those assholes have seized our village and are corrupting our holy land with their presence. Loading in progress. Come on now! Team, we'll move forward now. Tyagi ma'am. Village secured. We're heading towards the tunnel. - Ahlu, any weapons? IEDs? - Nothing. Everything is good. Akbar! Easy. Sorry, Uncle. It seems like your cousin does not like these people. He just wants to go back to his wife in one piece. Then he should have joined a bank. Such civilian thoughts don't suit the CIPD. - Hurry up, people. - Yes, sir. Tyagi ma'am, final bus heading towards to relocation camp. Kanji, Kaushal, move ahead and go towards the tunnel. Moving towards the tunnel. Mother, who are those people? They all work for your father. His lapdogs. Village evacuation complete. Moving to Stage Two. 1800 hours. Moving north-east to secure tunnel. Maintain formation. Officers, alert! Sir. Kaushal, stop the JCBs. Take positions. Take cover! Who is she? We won't let you open this tunnel. If this tunnel is opened, the curse will destroy everyone. Ma'am, the Naxals are not letting us in... Some superstitious nonsense. They have formed a human shield in front of the tunnel. - Don't worry. It's in the bag. - Mr. Mudhalvan, we have a problem. Look, we are your friends, not your enemies. We are here to help. To save you from the sufferings. Father... It's OK. It's just a little spat, not to worry. The Government will help you in every way it can to help you resettle your village in a different location. This mountain is haunted by a spirit. This tunnel has remained closed. It is still closed. And it will always remain closed. Does anyone else feel like we shouldn't open this tunnel? And get this party started? Lay down your weapons and you shall all be pardoned as per the Government's scheme. Vikram, look at their condition - dressed in rags and barefoot. Do they really look like a threat to you? Tyagi ma'am, ten tribals... I mean, ten encroachers are right in front of me. It's a mixed group - women, old and some young. Frankly, they don't seem like Naxals or terrorists. We can't shoot until they fire first... Why are we discussing these technicalities after dozens of missions together? Because our plan was an evacuation, not an encounter. When the CM arrives here in 13 hours... you can explain it to him. Vikram, prepare to open fire. Tyagi ma'am, neither have they started firing nor can we confirm that they... Prepare to open fire. I repeat, prepare to open fire. Officers, everyone will turn off recording mode on your body-cameras. - Sir. - Recording mode off. - Done, sir. - Yes, sir. OK, sir. Sirohi, think about this. Wait for my orders. Remember, ma'am, that the CM's man, Mr. Karia, insisted that we can't miss the deadline. Don't do it. This is wrong. Open fire. Open fire now! Listen, this is not an attack, it's mass murder. Sirohi, let's just open the tunnel and go home. Motherfucker! You said this guy could be trusted. Vikram. This is not my decision to make. It's not right. Don't give wrong orders, Sirohi. First contact made. There has been a blast. Fire! Keep firing! Move aside. - I think we should head back to the hotel. - Why? She has seen enough for today. The newspapers will need pictures after the tunnel is opened. We can leave after the picture is taken. Congratulations. Ajay, our driver didn't survive. Poor guy. He was a pretty bad driver anyway. Call the JCBs and clear out the tunnel quickly. My first successful operation. Did you see me? Quiet. I didn't even blink. Haq, be quiet. Sirohi, you know what you need to do. Down. Sirohi. Aren't we going to arrest them? Let's finish this and leave. If you open the tunnel, not a single person will survive. It's already done. You're making a big mistake. You have no idea of the power you are awakening. Move forward and be careful. Keep moving. We don't have much time. It should be done by tomorrow morning. This tunnel should have never been opened, sir. We were only guarding it. - We are not terrorists. - Shut up! We didn't set off that explosion, sir. There are no terrorists or Naxals here. Let's wrap this up... and get out of here. I don't hear any sounds. What do you mean? No one's saying anything. Hello? Come in. Hello. Come in. Walkie! Ambush. I repeat, ambush. There are insurgents in the tunnel. This was a trap. Sirohi, get here now. They are hiding inside the tunnel. Son of a bitch. How did they get inside? Don't know. - Yadav. - Sir! Stay here with them. We need to question them later. The rest come with me. Quickly. Run! - Tyagi ma'am. - Sirohi. Form a perimeter, protect the civilians. - Ahluwalia, you're in charge of comms. - Yes, Ma'am. Ma'am, I'll do it. - Why should you have all the fun? - But... Everyone stay alert. We didn't hear any gunfire coming from inside. So, they may only have melee weapons, but they might have hostages. Come on, squad. Let's go get our workers back. Take positions! Keep cover! Squad, night vision on. Stay sharp, people. Picking up interference. All clear? Tyagi ma'am, do you copy me? Sirohi, cams on. Chandran, look to your right. This place is huge. Stick to the shadows. - Chandran, Tripathi... - No trace of the workers. Eyes open. Come in. - I can see something ahead. - I repeat. Come in. Night vision. Chandran, Tripathi, your cameras are distorted. British colors? Ma'am, there's something down there. Check your corners. Tyagi Ma'am, do you copy me? Sirohi, Akbar, come here, please. - What happened? - Look at this. I guess an entire British regiment was buried here. Ma'am, there's someone out there. Ma'am, there's someone right there. - What is that? - I don't know. Alert, guys. Hey. Don't move. What is this? Don't move. Turn around slowly. Hello? - The cameras are malfunctioning. - I'm talking to you. It's become static. I'm losing signal. Don't just stand there and watch. Go get Tyagi ma'am. Sirohi, sir! Fuck! Chandran! Tripathi! - What happened inside? - Chandran! Tripathi! Where is the rest of the unit? Who attacked? - He's bleeding. - Where is Tyagi ma'am? What happened? Where is Tyagi Ma'am? - Let's go in. - Sirohi! OK, I am going. No, man. It's a bad decision. Suit yourself, but I am going in alone. Sir! I am coming, too! - Nadir! No. - Sir, I am ready! Vikram, he won't go. This is his first mission. Exactly, it's my first mission. Please! - You know what, fuck it. Let's go! - No. Ahlu, you stay here. It's an order. Haq, come with me. Yes, sir! Clear. Nag? Verma? Sir, you aren't audible on the walkie. Walkie is not working. Sir, there is a strange smell. Haq, stay close. Tyagi ma'am! Ma'am? Up there. What the fuck is this? Akbar, it's been too long. We should go inside. Hey, where are you going? Haq! Sirohi, sir! Sirohi, sir! Haq! You cannot leave us unprotected. First, arrange for our safe return home. My family's with me. My cousin's in there. Haq. Run! Get out of here! Quickly! - Haq. - Hurry up! Get out of here! Quickly! - Mother! - Run! Hurry up! Down. - Move. Move. - Run! Cover, Kaushal. Sit down! Those assholes set our vehicles on fire. Fuck! Yadav. Move. Keep running. Down. Move! Down! Yadav! Yadav! What happened? What happened, Yadav? Sir, they jumped me and escaped. Will you two keep talking or take some action? - Get us out of here! - Kaushal! Wait. Stay down. There are old barracks out here. There is an old British base. Just a little further, among the trees. It's the only place where we can hide. Let's go there and call for backup. We can wait there. You want us to put our lives at stake again just like you did with Haq? We've no intel about this place? If it has doors and walls, that's all I need. Can you come up with a better option? Come on! Down! Move! Come on! Sirohi, all clear? - Sir, there's no one in the trees. - Yeah, clear. Down! Down. Move. Keep moving. Down! Come on. Men, keep moving! Come on. Clear. Sir, we can't see anyone here. Civilians first. Sit down. OK. Sit down. Come. The door is locked. The two Naxals must be hiding here. Open the door! What the bloody fuck? You did it again! I told you so before - we shouldn't have come here! Open the door! Let us in! We cannot stay out here for too long! Open the door. - Keep the wounded outside. - What? - And we will let you in. - Are you crazy? It is risky to bring the wounded inside. They are a danger to everyone. - Open the door! - Open the door! Open the door! Hey, open the door! Are you deaf? Open the door. Down!
