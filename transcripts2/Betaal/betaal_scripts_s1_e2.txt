 Open the door! Open the door, quick! We can't wait here any longer! Open the door, quick! - Hey, girl, open the door! - Open the door! - Hey, girl! - Hey, Sirohi, do something! - Quickly, cover the civilians! - Open the door! We don't have time. They are pushing us back. - Open the door, we're not injured. - Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!

 Sirohi, who are these people? Naxals don't fight like this. This mountain is haunted by a spirit! Chandran! Tripathi! Sirohi, how many people were in there? Let us in, we're not wounded. Sir, you must've seen something? Open the bloody door! Open the door! Orders, Sirohi? Down! Saanvi! Fuck this! - Come in! Get down! - Go! I'll take care of them! - Let's go! - What happened to mom?

 Here. Akbar. Mom! Father, where is mom? Listen to me! Father, where are they taking her? Stop them, Father! She's dead, Saanvi. She's dead. We can't do anything about it. Hurry up! These bloody Naxals have a full-blown army. Hurry up! Let's go. Akbar, faster! Calm down! - Chandran, Tripathi, stay with me. - They've lost a lot of blood! What the fuck just happened? - Where is mom? - Hold yourself together, asshole! - We will find your mother. Don't cry. - Father! They killed us! They fucking killed us! Sirohi, orders? Barricade now? And... Cameras? Shall we secure the building? Yes. OK. Hey, Sirohi! Get your bodycams and hand them over. What the fuck is this place? It's massive! There was a whole fucking army out there! - Then why the fuck did they stop? - Father. Quit yapping and get this door secured. Where's mom? Hey, Sirohi. Find her mother. Where is mom? Get those planks over here. Quick. - Mom. - Calm down, dear. Where did the tribals take Mrs. Mudhalvan? I don't know, but if I see them, I'm gonna kill those assholes. Father, where is mom? Tree line is clear. - Mom! - Hey, Sirohi. Front covered, moving to rear. I'll find your wife's body, Mr. Mudhalvan. Please, take care of the child. Mom. Open the door or I will break it down. You can try all you want. We are prepared to fight back in every way we can. Easy. You're OK. Back from the jaws of death on your first mission. You're one lucky guy. Where am I? McDonalds. Want a burger? I've cleaned your wound and stitched it up. So no need to worry. I'll give you a shot later. Relax. That is a nasty bite. Bite? Don't worry. - Kanji, any movement? - Can't see anything. Nothing is visible. Akbar? Haq is awake. Check on him. What's wrong with you? Do you have a death wish? You jackass! You want a medal on the first day? You had me scared out of my wits. What happened in there? I don't know, cousin. Can't remember a thing. Doesn't matter. Brave soldier. Brave, but stupid. Don't try anything like this again. If anything happens to you, then I'll be answerable to Aunty. Fine, I'll take care. Yes, please do! - What just happened? - It's a terrible loss. They think the Naxals were behind the blasts. - We should tell them... - That it was actually us? Are you out of your mind? Keep your mouth shut and your eyes peeled. We've nothing to do with whatever is going on out there. We don't want to reveal anything that can get us into trouble. But this is wrong. Wrong my ass! I pulled you out of the gutter. It won't take me long to send you back. Understood? These bullets are so weird. 0.75 caliber round. The Naxals are using locally-made ammunition against us. Look. Musket round. Completely old school. - Any movement? - Not yet, sir. They're using ancient artillery against us. Fucking pricks. Could have had my brother's name on it. Come on, back to position. - Are you OK? - I am fine, sir. Yadav, update? How is she? Her pulse is normal, but Tyagi ma'am isn't responding. Perhaps due to shock? - Any injury? - Not that I can see. What's wrong with her hair? Perhaps due to shock? Ahlu... report. All cameras are in position. Building secured. We have eyes open. I repeat, eyes open. Tyagi ma'am... talk to me. I can't understand what I've seen. Talk to me. Please. Did you see what I saw? Inside the tunnel... He was right in front of me, Sirohi. Staring into my eyes. He was talking to me. He's telling me to follow orders. He hasn't seen the outside world for many years. He was weak... but he's growing stronger, Sirohi. Who is he? He's growing stronger, Sirohi. Who is he? Ma'am? Ma'am? Talk to me, please. This is Baaz Squad calling for 34GMD. Six men are down. We need backup. Kaushal, help Yadav to take the bodies inside. Yes, sir. We are secure in an old British barracks. Our coordinates: 05786543. The villagers have set up some rudimentary electric board, so we have electricity. We have electricity. - Here, Kaushal. Put him here. - He's very heavy. This room seems OK. I'll examine both of them here. We have suspected Naxals barricaded within the central room of the building. Their motives are, as of now, unknown. Hello? Hello? This is second-in-command, Vikram Sirohi of Baaz Squad. We need evacuation and backup. Hello, we have secured the perimeter, awaiting your response. Damn it! Something's jamming the frequency. Hello? Is anyone listening? This is Baaz Squad calling for 34GMD. Hello? - Hello? - What happened? The message is going through, but no one's replying. All I hear is this weird sound. Vikram, what kind of outfit is this? They wiped out half of our squad in the blink of an eye. How? Everything happened too quickly to react. The bodycams weren't recording. Walkies weren't working. And whoever we faced in there, they weren't normal, and neither was this encounter. Even AC Haq can vouch for it. AC Haq doesn't remember anything. He barely escaped from the jaws of death with no thanks to you. I am sorry, Sirohi sir. I am trying to recollect, but all I remember is I saw Tyagi ma'am, we... and the rest is blank. Less than 12 hours to sunrise. I think we should make this our base and wait for the CM to arrive. As soon as he arrives here with the Military Squad, we'll leave. Are you out of your mind? The hostiles are waiting for reinforcements. If they get here with full strength, there will be no escape for us. This place will be a slaughterhouse. I think he has a point, Vikram. - I need some time. - He needs more time. Time is a luxury we don't have. We should leave now. Only I decide what we do. I am leading this group. And it's your leadership that got us into this trouble. - Akbar. - Yes! Just like you did with Nadir. - Hey, watch your tone! - What do you want to imply? - You want to know? - What should I do? - What should've been done. - What should be done? We should've never come here. - It's your fault that we're here. - Shut up! Oh, fuck! We need to get out of here while the perimeter is clear. Those motherfuckers must be hiding in the forest. I'll try to open the room. Once we get inside, we can interrogate the villagers for information. Shoot those fuckers first and ask questions later. - Sir, please... - Kill those motherfuckers! They have my wife's body in there. They are witnesses to the encounter. I'm telling you, it'll bring more trouble. Kill those bastards and get rid of them. Sir, we only take orders from CIPD and not from civilians. I know who you lot are. Really? And who are you? We're still trying to fathom. You said there was no one in the tunnel, but they were waiting for us. We aren't being told what's going on here. Tell your subordinate to shut her mouth, Mr. Second-in-command. I think she hasn't learnt her lesson yet. Would you like one? DC Ahluwalia! Show some respect to Mr. Mudhalvan. Do you have cutting tools in your bag? I do, sir. Take it out. We're... getting in that room. We'll protect Mr. Mudhalvan and his family at any cost. Thank you. About fucking time, motherfucker! Bring me the little girl. Bring her to me. Who are you? We will tear you apart. Haq, take Mr. Mudhalvan and his daughter out of here. Hurry! - Now! - Yes, sir. Take your guns and get back to your positions. Be quick. If there's any movement, just open fire. Hello? Who's speaking? Who are you? Answer me! Who are you? Sweet kid. - Yadav, come in. What's the status? - Fuck! What are you doing, Sirohi? Yadav! Fuck! Fuck! Who bit him? Who would bite through flesh like an animal? He shot himself. What? Don't be crazy. Why would he shoot himself? To escape something worse? Where are Chandran and Tripathi? Their bodies were lying here. I told you we should get out of here. Those fucking villagers must've taken their bodies also! Motherfuckers! Dear... no need to worry. Everything is fine. I am right here. I will not hand you over to the Naxals. And now, you even have a personal bodyguard. Father... Yes, dear? Why did you do this? What? You and Bhunnu Uncle. I saw you. Go to sleep. Take care of her. Sir! Let this door remain closed, for everyone's sake. What are you doing with our dead bodies? First the female and now our soldiers. What? The bodies have disappeared? I know you have them. Sir, we're not responsible for their disappearance. You mean, the bodies got up and walked away? Speak up. Come. I won't harm you. The bodies... Tell me about the bodies. What do you know? Where are the bodies? What happened in the tunnel? Looks like all hell broke loose on you. Your expression indicates that it wasn't a normal attack. Am I right? They are shocked by what happened in the tunnel. They are scared too. Like it or not, but we're in this together. What is your father saying? He is my husband. Show him. Come with me. And try not to faint. You guys are monsters. Sir, this is for our safety. Our ancestors have said, once the demons wound any person or kill them, either by biting or scratching, the infection spreads through the body. I don't see any kind of infection or disease, but I can see what you've done. You are barbarians. Look... the bullets that killed her were demon bullets. We didn't know what effect the demon bullets could cause, so this is the precaution we took. Now, do you understand? Everyone knows that Betaal Mountain is haunted. It's cursed. A curse that stays with you till the end. Betaal's curse. Once infected... there is no way to stop it. It spreads through your body like leprosy. And not just your body - it penetrates through to your soul. And then, these infected bodies will join his army - an army whose hunger can never be sated. Whose army? The Colonel. He is Betaal. Only Aunty... could communicate with Betaal, but you killed her. I can assure you one thing... we are safe here. The effigy I burned out there and the line I drew outside using salt, turmeric, and ashes... is keeping us safe. As long as the fire's burning and the line's intact, that devil cannot harm us. This is why... those who are infected... we have no choice but to burn them. If you don't take care of the dead now, then none of us will survive. The corpses of your dead soldiers are walking around in this building. You have to burn them. We have kerosene. Main entrance seems clear to me. We need cover fire and a smoke screen at the tree line. If we take that route and get to the valley... If you cross over the line made by turmeric, salt, and ashes and head for the trees, then no one will survive. Are you all right, Vikram? Ahlu, those villagers didn't take our bodies. The bodies were infected due to bites, so they... You should... get some rest. The corpses of Chandran and Tripathi have already infected Yadav, and they may also infect us. I know this sounds very strange, but believe me. We don't have much time. Vikram... I don't think you're in a state to take command. It's fine. People often become indecisive in a state of shock. Trust me, please. She is right. You're done. Now, who's the next in command after Tyagi and Sirohi? - Who's going to take charge? - Ahlu. Ahlu will take charge. We'll leave in 15 minutes. Mr. Mudhalvan, get your daughter ready. Kanji, Kaushal, get the ammunition ready. We don't have enough time. Saanvi, all OK? Yes. - Haq. - Sir. Come with me. Hello? Hello? Is anybody listening? Anybody hear me? I am Mudhalvan. And... I am Saanvi's father. The little girl's father. I want to... negotiate. "They found something in the mountain." An ancient grotto, some kind of shrine. Could this actually be it? I thought it superstitious nonsense, but now... Is this the Betaal shrine "and if so, what Godlike power might I find within?" He wrote this. "The Journal of..." It. Col. John P Lynedoch. The God, the... "The God..." "The God thou serv'st... is thine own appetite." Yadav's no more. I thought I should check. How's your condition? I am fine, sir. But you don't look OK. No, sir, I am in perfect condition. How is your wound? - It's fine. - Show me. Fuck! My wound's in a bad state, isn't it? You will be fine, Haq. You will be fine. Don't worry. I don't want to die, sir. I am not ready. I was just trying to prove myself, sir. I wanted to be like you someday. You're much better, Assistant Commandant. Your views, your courage and ideals are better. Time keeps testing people. I failed long ago. I disappointed you. I was wounded, sir. What disappointment? I am proud of you, Haq. Who was the only guy to volunteer? It was you. Who was brave enough to enter that tunnel with me? It was you. When everyone else was shit-scared, who was the only other man there? - You. - Me. Who fought beside me? - Me. - Who rescued our Commanding Officer? - It was me. - Who is the newest hero of the Baaz Squad? - Me. - That's right, it's you, Haq. - Yes, sir. - It's you, Haq. - Me, sir. - It's you, Haq. - It's you, Haq. - Sirohi! Why? Move back. It's OK. Yadav's bag. Motherfucker! I found this burnt piece of rag. What did you do with Yadav's body? You cut him into pieces and burnt him. You sick fuck! Give me his bag. - Give me his bag. - OK, fine. Sirohi has gone mad! Let's leave him here. It'll be better for all of us. He is one of us. We can't abandon him! He is ill. How about you? What is Haq's condition? Is he in a condition to travel or not? Yes. Of course. Mom? Father? Is it you? Leave me! I won't go! Leave me! No! No! No! No! Saanvi! Throw me the rod! Hurry up! Saanvi! Throw me the rod! I am concerned for the child... not you. Mom. Where is she? You will be fine. I am Vikram. Vikram Sirohi. I will protect you. Promise. I am Saanvi. Nice meeting you, Saanvi. You guys can sit here and wait to die. - I'm leaving here with my cousin. - I am with him. I am leaving too. Wait! No one's going anywhere. Saanvi, don't stand with her. It's because of her that your mother got killed. Akbar, shoot this bloody woman. She's the cause of the problems. Hey! There's a lot more going on here than we actually understand. And if you don't believe me, then check Chandran and Tripathi for yourself. - Vikram uncle is telling the truth. - Chandran and Tripathi... are just dead bodies. - Monster! - Save me, cousin! - Hey! - Save me from them, cousin. Sirohi, I will shoot. - Shoot her. - Hey, girl, let him go. - Sirohi, let him go. - Let him go. Let him go. Nadir, come over here. Have you lost your mind? Are you trying to stop us? Did you join the enemy, traitor? Wait a minute. No one's going to shoot anyone. Lower your gun. - Lower your gun. - Ahlu, let me talk. Look, let me check his pulse. He is not normal. You can check yourself. And I know you won't believe me, but Chandran and Tripathi's bodies attacked this girl. Haq is infected, too. Soon he will become one of them. He is right. Chandran and Tripathi are dead! You are lying. Shoot, cousin. Don't think. Kill them all. Kaushal, check his pulse. Kaushal, don't move a muscle. Shoot him. Shoot him, cousin. Don't think. Just shoot. All of them. Finish them. Kaushal, check his pulse as Vikram said. Sirohi, stop him! Shoot them, cousin. Akbar, let him check! Kaushal, don't come forward! Follow the order! I will shoot! Check his pulse, Kaushal! Kill them! Shoot! Akbar, what are you looking at? - Don't come forward. - Check his pulse! Shoot them all, cousin! Fuck! Kanji! Fuck! Come! Hold his hand! Akbar! Sir! Damn it! We're screwed. Akbar, take position. Quick!
