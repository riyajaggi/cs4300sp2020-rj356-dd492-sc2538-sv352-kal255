 That and the $100 gift cards. NOLAN: Oh. Hang on a second. Sorry. Let me help you with those. Oh. Thank you... Officer Nolan. - Yeah. And you are? - I'm Alma. Nice to meet you. NOLAN: Are all these yours? Oh, no, no. They... They were my father's. He was a paratrooper back in World War II. - [GROANS] - And when he came back from the war, he brought all this with him. I've been carrying it with me since he passed in '74. Oh, Alma...

 this is in good condition. You could get real money for this. Oh, no. I wouldn't know where to start. Besides, I'm moving in with my son's family. I don't want these around my grandkids. Well, we are here to help. ALMA: Oh, those were his pistols. He brought them from Germany to San Francisco. And that one there is Ginny. ♪ ♪ [SHAKILY] Alma, is that a land mine? Yes, a claymore, I think. From his time in Vietnam. Uh, can we get a bomb squad to the front lobby? Now. Well, I'm so glad you brought this in, because these are extremely unstable. Tell you what. I'm gonna stay here to dispose of this. Officer Chen is gonna get you to a safe distance, and then we'll get you those gift cards we talked about. Oh, uh, what about the ones in my trunk? [EXPLOSION, CAR ALARMS BLARING] ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ♪ ♪ whoa, oh, oh ♪ ♪ I'm gonna win for you ♪ ♪ Like I know you want me to do ♪ No, no, no, I'm not upset. I'm just surprised at how fast it happened. All right, text me when you get back to campus. Love you, too. Bye. - BEN: Hey. - Hey! BEN: Oh... oh, I know I said Sedona had some easy hikes, but you should at least put on shoes. Sarah just accepted an offer on the house. That's my girl. Well, it's a seller's market. Besides, it's not like you're going back to Foxburg. Unless the house was your safety net - in case this didn't pan out. - No. - Okay. - I just always imagined Henry raising his own kids there, you know? Mark their height on the same doorjamb and camping in the backyard like we did. Aww. That's sweet, Mr. Cleaver. But Henry's 18. Like, the last thing he's thinking about is inheriting your house. He's out there starting a new life. As are you. So go get dressed. We have quite an adventure ahead. - Yes, we do. - [CELLPHONE BEEPS] "Mandatory Emergency Callback for all patrol." Huh. What does that mean? It means we're having different adventures today. CAPT. ANDERSEN: Thank you for coming in on your day off. The Vice President is making an unscheduled visit to our city. So it's all hands on deck. - Agent Danvers. - Thank you, Captain. As always, the Secret Service appreciates the LAPD's assistance in clearing and securing "Redwood's" route. - These are your Operation Plan Manuals. - [CELLPHONE BUZZES] AGENT DANVERS: Each officer's name has been listed under a specific Quadrant and Zone, along with your responsibilities. Your watch commander will liaison with me - throughout the day as issues arise. - [CELLPHONE BUZZES] [MUTTERING] Come on... I'm sorry. Officer West. Is there something you want to share with the group? Um, no, sir. Uh... I'm sorry. I just, uh... I had plans I needed to cancel. So did everyone here, yet they're paying attention. Yes, sir. These assignments are your sole priority today. You will not field calls from dispatch. Let the day shift deal with that. Captain? Most of you know the drill. For our rookies... Today is going to be ugly. Everything we do to ensure the safety of Redwood will create gridlock. It's important to be patient and vigilant. That's all. You're dismissed. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] SGT. GREY: Bishop and Nolan. Agent Danvers has a special assignment for you. We've got a Class 2 threat we need chased down. Class 2? Class 1 is someone who's made overt threatening statements but made no overt action. Class 2 are individuals who have a history of assaultive behaviors toward authority figures. And Class 3? Had agents on their doorsteps the second we learned of this visit. Stanley Knott. Guy's made repeated threats against the VP over the last few years. AGENT DANVERS: Nothing actionable, but he's got previous assault charges against a host of supervisors. I need you to make sure he's not planning anything. - Happy to do it, ma'am. - AGENT DANVERS: Great. Call me if you need any assistance. - "Happy to do it"? - What? Nothing. I've just never heard you use that word before. LUCY: I don't get all the fuss. It seems like we're getting a day of overtime just to close roads and hang signs. That's like saying being drawn and quartered is fun time with horses. We're literally creating traffic jams during rush hour on purpose. Everything we do today is gonna piss someone off. - Quadrant One. - Quadrant Two. I mean, we deal with angry people every shift, but a day of OT means I can finally fix - the air-conditioning on my car. - [CHUCKLES] What? Air-conditioning makes you soft. You gotta get comfortable with being uncomfortable. - That's the job. - Is he serious? As a heart attack, Boot. Which... I gotta say... you almost gave the watch commander back there. Seriously, playing with your phone during a briefing is a cardinal sin. I-I lost focus. I only hope you were canceling something important, because Grey won't forget that for a while. Just, uh, breakfast with my mom. - Is that all for us? - Yep. Extra road flares for the uptick in accidents. Extra ticket books for the increase in idiots. Extra crime-scene tape for blocking sidewalks. - And cones for closing roads. - Okay, okay, I get it. Oh, we're not done yet. Hats and Bats. Tactical helmets and 42-inch batons for riot control, along with heavy-duty vests if things get ugly. And my personal favorite, the 40-millimeter tear-gas launcher for when democracy gets real. But, hey, at least you'll be able to ride in comfort. [UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS] ♪ ♪ [MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY IN DISTANCE] NOLAN: Do you think our Class 2 threat is actually a threat? Maybe. TALIA: Maybe writing hate-letters to the Veep is just his way of blowing off steam. Did you just "glass half-full" our suspect? Who are you and what have you done with my T.O.? Look, I'm trying a much more positive approach. But if you'd rather I go back to yesterday's attitude... Oh, no, no, no, no. Uh, no one's a bigger fan of positive than me. That cannot be right. - Problem? - No. Sorry. My ex is selling our house. I largely stayed out of it because, honestly, I didn't want her to. NOLAN: But I just saw the price she's getting. The place has doubled in value. Mm, that sounds like a good thing to me, Officer Positive. N-No, it is. Yes. I was just thinking about trying to buy her out, you know, keep it in the family, but... I can't match that price. There's our guy. Hey, Stanley. Can we talk to you for a minute? - What do you want? - NOLAN: Haven't you heard? Your friend's in town. What friend? I don't have a friend. Vice President. So what? So what's in the bag, Stanley? - Nothing. - Show us. - No. - We're not asking. We have probable cause based on your prior actions and a clear distress. [HORN HONKS, TIRES SCREECH] [GRUNTING] Come on. Hands. Let's go. - Weapon. - It's just a flare gun. I don't need a license. I looked it up online. Were you planning on pointing that flare gun at the Vice President today, Stanley? - He needs to be stopped. - Sounds like a "yes" to me. You're under arrest, Stanley. Did we just foil a real-life assassination attempt? He's a nut with a flare gun wrapped in underpants. Not Jason Bourne. But we just might have prevented a tragedy. Was that so hard? WOMAN: Whose streets? - ALL: Our streets! - WOMAN: Whose streets? MAN: One, two, three! ALL: Our streets! WOMAN: No justice. ALL: No peace! [SIREN CHIRPS, CELLPHONE RINGING] - WOMAN: No justice. - ALL: No peace! - WOMAN: No justice. - ALL: No peace! Officer West, we're about to walk into a volatile crowd, - and you're answering your phone? - Um, no, ma'am. No, I'm sorry. It's just my mom. - I never got to call her back earlier. - Now is not the time for personal calls. - Of course. - Okay, folks, you can't be here. There's a designated protest area across the street, - behind the barriers. - We have a right to free speech. - This is public property. - JACKSON: It's not. This is the hotel's property, and blocking the entrance is a fire hazard. - No justice! - ALL: No peace! - No justice. - ALL: No peace! - You got a dispersal card? - Yes, ma'am. - No justice! - No peace! I am Officer Jackson West. I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly, and, in the name of the People of the State of California, command all those assembled to immediately disperse. You heard him. Break it up or go to jail. Who has a key for the handcuffs? Notify the mobile field force. - WOMAN: Arnold?! What's wrong? - He's choking. - WOMAN: Oh, my God, Arnold... - Miss, give Officer Lopez some space. [GRUNTING] - [VOMITS] - [CROWD GROANS] [GRUNTS, COUGHS] [GROANS] [DISTANT ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] TIM: All right, listen up. Until tomorrow at 3:00 p.m., the stretch of Vine between Melrose and Franklin will be off limits. Sanitation services will be arriving in 20 minutes. You'll have until then to pack up. Rope off the block. Make sure everyone moves off. [SNORING] Sir? Sir? Sorry to wake you, but I'm gonna need you to start packing up, all right? - Bitch, those are my sneakers! - Get out! - [INDISTINCT ARGUING] - Oh, hey! Hey, hey! LUCY: Hey! Stop it! Just stop. [WOMAN SCREAMS] TIM: That's enough! Hey. That's enough. - WOMAN: Ow. Ow. - LUCY: Hands behind your back. Don't move. [HANDCUFFS CLICK] All right. Stand up. Here we go. [GRUNTING] - Chen. - What? Stop. Don't move. ♪ ♪ TIM: [DISTANTLY] Chen. Chen. [LOUDER] Chen. I didn't see it. I mean, it was... - it was on the ground, and... - It's okay, but I need to pull the needle out. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ TIM: What's the procedure when an officer is exposed on duty? - What? - Focus. What do we do now? Um... [INHALES DEEPLY] "Collect the evidence." Bring the officer and the item to the nearest hospital to test for infections and diseases "that may have been transmitted." And where's the nearest hospital? Shaw Memorial. Make sure an officer posts up here until Veep passes through. - Got it. - Come on. Let's go. [MOTORCYCLES RUMBLING, SIRENS CHIRPING] JACKSON: Hey, Mom, it's me. Um, sorry about this morning. Uh, just call me back, okay? I need t... Um, just... just call me back, okay? You gonna tell me what's going on? Nothing. Just family stuff. I can't believe I have to wear this bulky vest all day. That's why you always carry an extra uniform on days like today. Yeah, I know. I, uh... I just... Forgot? Get it together, Officer West. You can't afford to lose focus out here. [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] Which side of the building faces the street? To the right. Should we really be penalizing these people for their civic engagement? Supreme Court ruled that displaying anatomically impossible pictures qualifies as obscene, so hanging erotic banners of the V.P. in 10 windows of an apartment building definitely isn't protected by the First Amendment. I'm just saying, the guy should be flattered. [CHUCKLES] Police. Open up. [MUFFLED MUSIC PLAYS] What's up? You have an obscene banner hanging in your window. It needs to come down. Oh. Okay. Sorry. My neighbor offered me 100 bucks to put that there. Well, it's illegal. No problem. I'll make sure to take care of it. Sir, is there something inside you don't want us to see? No. Step back. Hands where I can see them. [UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS ON STEREO] What the hell is this? Sir, how many people live here? - Um... not many. - Pat him down. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Polícia! Polícia! JACKSON: So much for the element of surprise. It's okay. We're not here for them. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Go get the banner. What do you charge these people? $500 a month times 20? That's taking advantage of people too afraid to call the police on your ass. Got it. Do we have to call ICE? No, L.A.'s a sanctuary city. Our job is to police the streets, not check status. But we're not letting this go. Get his driver's license and do an F.I. We'll be back tomorrow with code enforcement. [SIRENS CHIRPING] Hi. Um, I need to get my blood tested. I got stuck with a used hypodermic needle. Oh. Uh, yeah, one sec. [WHISPERING] Um, where did that... [CLATTERING] If you could fill this out. Have a seat in the waiting room, and we'll be right with you. You must be new, because no experienced nurse lets an armed cop sit with civilians. What do you think happens if somebody attempts to grab her weapon? - I-I-I... - The hospital protocol dictates that an armed officer be seen immediately. So set her up in a room right now and find a doctor. Yes, sir. GINO: Right this way. ♪ ♪ NOLAN: When do rookies get a step increase in pay? Not until you're off probation. - This about the house? - Yeah. I'm thinking about buying it as an investment. I'm sure Sarah will sell it to me if I can just... match the offer. It's not an investment if you can't afford it. Well, I have some savings. Maybe Ben will give me a loan. The only thing worse than going into debt - is doing it with a friend. - I get it. It's just I built that house from the ground up. You know, everything... The tree house in the backyard. My son's whole life was at that place. Sounds nice. It was. We never really talk about where you're from. Let's just say it didn't have a tree house. It's a good job on the Class 2. As a reward, you get another assignment. Look, it's not so special. Every job is an opportunity, sir. - Is she feeling okay? - Being positive. Positive? Good. 'Cause I'm assigning you both to rover duty. - What's that? - LAPD version of a Gofer. You'll spend the rest of your shift assisting officers all over the city... SGT. GREY: bringing them food and water, giving them bathroom breaks. Here's a backlog of requests. Get to it. Well, it's an opportunity to support our fellow officers. Okay, I'm just gonna say it. It's starting to freak me out. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] TESHONNE: Can I help you, officers? Ma'am, there's an obscene banner hanging in your window. We need you to remove it. I'm sorry, but I can't do that. JACKSON: We know your neighbor paid you. But it's a violation of Penal Code 415.5. We can arrest you for having it up. - I need that money. - Ma'am, it's only $100. Only?! [SCOFFS] Have you ever been broke, Officer? Because I'm on the edge of living on the street. And that $100 is the difference between me being able to pay my rent this month and getting evicted. Look, ma'am, I'm very sorry to hear that, but, um, you have to take the banner down. [CELLPHONE BUZZING] But we just became aware of major code violations in one of these apartments. I see no reason why forgiving your rent for a few months couldn't be part of the building owner's penalty. Really? Really. Now go take down that banner. [HORNS HONKING] Officers. Let us know if you need anything else. So, what's with the positive attitude? - Do I need a reason? - No. It's just after four months together, it's the first day you've rolled in with it. I figured something must be up. [HORNS HONKING, CRASHING] That can't be good. - How the hell did you not see me?! - You cut in front of me! PRAVEEN: You wouldn't let me in! - DONNY: Yeah? - PRAVEEN: Yeah! PRAVEEN: Learn how to drive, man! - [GUN COCKS] - PRAVEEN: Whoa. Hey, man, I... Gun! PRAVEEN: I'm sorry. [GUNSHOT] NOLAN: Drop the gun! NOLAN: Put the gun on the ground right now. Hands behind your head. Interlace your fingers. NOLAN: Do not move. I-I was just trying to scare him. WOMAN: [GASPING, MOANING] - Nolan! - Over here. With me. Come on. Control, 7-Adam-15. We have a gunshot victim... female, adult, shotgun wound to the chest. We need fire and ambulance. ETA? DISPATCH: 7-Adam-15, at least 10 minutes. TALIA: Okay, help me get her out of the car. We need to stop the bleeding. Come on. I got you. I got you. Come on. - Got that? - Uh-huh. [GRUNTS] I didn't mean to hurt her! - Shut up! Look away. - [GASPING] All right, stay with us. We're gonna get you to a hospital. It's a chest wound. It sounds like her lung's collapsed. TALIA: Put pressure on it. We're gonna need to put something in the wound... keep her alive till EMTs get here. - Officer Bishop. - Get the kit bag... There's gotta be something in there we can use. Talia. She's gone. ♪ ♪ [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] - You okay? - What do you think? Sorry. It was a dumb question. ♪ ♪ Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you. My therapist is trying to get me to be more positive. You asked why I was acting differently today. No, I just... I didn't know you went. - No reason you should. - 'Cause the job frowns on it? 'Cause it's nobody's business. But, yeah... it is looked at as a weakness amongst the boys in blue. Well, that's stupid. Lot of stressful stuff we deal with, what we just went through, it's unhealthy not to talk about it. Does that mean you see someone? Sarah and I used to go to couples' counseling. [SIGHS] And I used to look down on it... thought it was like paying someone to be your friend, but I was wrong. It was helpful. Just, in our case, not helpful enough. So, what, you think less of me now? No. The opposite. I think anyone brave enough to confront their problems head-on deserves respect. [DOOR OPENS] GINO: She's all set. We're gonna put a rush on the tests. We should have results in a few hours. I'm sorry about earlier. I... I didn't know. [CHUCKLES] It's okay. Thanks. Falling down the WebMD rabbit hole isn't gonna change your results. HIV is three times more prevalent in the homeless community than it is in the general population. Hepatitis is five times more prevalent... And cows kill more people a year than sharks. - The facts are whatever you make them. - What... What if I get hep C from this needle, and one day I get shot, and you're trying to stop the bleeding and you forget that, you know, you have a... you have a cut on your hand? Or worse... a kid gets shot and I the one with the cut? - And it's just... - Then you'll be a cop with hep C and a cut. You signed up to put your life on the line. That means your health, too. Focusing on fear isn't gonna change the outcome. Lab results are gonna take hours. Do you want to hang out in the worst-case-scenario panic room, or you want to get back to work? Get that air-conditioning fixed? I thought air-conditioning made me soft. Well, it does, but I can't solve all your problems today. [CHUCKLES] Go splash some water on your face. Let's get back out there. [QUIETLY] Okay. [INHALES DEEPLY] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE] [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [SIREN CHIRPS] Just this apartment and we're done.

Do you hear that? - RUTH: [CRYING] - Ma'am? Ma'am, I'm Officer Angela Lopez. I'm with the LAPD. Can you open the front door? RUTH: [CRYING] I can't. I can't. Please, ma'am. It would really help us out. RUTH: Oh, I can't. The knots... [MOANS] Kick it down. ♪ ♪ LOPEZ: Take care of her. I'll clear the apartment. Okay. I'm Officer Jackson West.

No. Luke said I had to stay here... - Who's Luke, ma'am? - He's my son. - [CRYING] Where is he? - Okay... What's going on? What happened to my door? - Ohh. - Are you Luke? - Yeah. - You did this to your mother? So she won't hurt herself. She's in the early stages of dementia. I had a job interview. I couldn't take her with me. I got stuck in traffic getting back. - The damn V.P.... - If your mother has health issues, then you need to get her a caretaker. Or a neighbor to watch her. You know how much that costs? I do the best I can with what I got. This is your mother. What kind of garbage treats his mom like... - LOPEZ: Officer West! - Oh... LOPEZ: You're under arrest for elder abuse. Hook him up. [SCOFFS] [HANDCUFFS CLICKING] RUTH: Oh, no, no! Don't do that! LOPEZ: Oh, ma'am. It's okay. It's all right, ma'am. - No, oh, my God. - It's okay, ma'am. [SIRENS WAIL] You're gonna be fine. [BREATHES SHAKILY] Sorry, I didn't realize someone else was in here.

Isn't that what the department's been doing all day? Yeah, but this is what happens when the Vice President decides to stop at Philippe's for a French Dip and a photo op. So basically, you're saying we have to clear out a whole new section of town because he wants to stop for a sandwich? Yep.

Yeah, heading back to D.C. now. Look, earlier today, I gave a direct order to two of your officers that was disregarded. I'm aware. And I support their decision.

I'd been counting the days until I could start the Academy, and suddenly, I was facing the idea of putting it all on hold. I agonized over it. But Marshall said that he could wait. That it really wasn't that serious. So... I took the out. He was looking out for you. He suffered acute renal failure two months after we started. He almost died. Whoa, why didn't you tell us? I was ashamed. I mean, it was my fault. I... Luckily, the hospital found another donor and he got the transplant, but my mom still hasn't forgiven me. Which is why missing brunch was such a big deal. Yeah. And in her mind, I chose the job before family. Again. - It's not the same. - [SCOFFS] It's not. Deep down she knows it's true. Have you told her how heartbroken you are about all of this? She hasn't really given me the chance. Well, then take it. Trust me, as unpleasant as it's gonna be, the waiting is so much worse. - Officer Chen? - Yeah, that's... that's me.

Thanks to you. ♪ ♪ Hey. Good job today. Are you being for real, or are you just being positive? - [CHUCKLES] For real. - Thanks. What did you decide about the loan from your rich friend? Oh. That you were right. Money and friendships just don't mix. Look, your son is never gonna forget that house. I moved around so much, I never had a place that was special like that. But it's not about the place, it's about what happened there. You own those memories. That's actually... an excellent perspective. Hmm. I'll send you a bill. ♪ ♪ ♪ Give it to you rougher ♪ - All done? - All done. The house is now in the hands of a lovely young couple, their kids, and a French bulldog. Well, I'm sure they'll take good care of it. Yeah. Wow. What a day. [CHUCKLES] Wait till the President comes. - I hear it's twice as bad. - That's not possible. Well, you missed all the drama altogether. I got stuck with a dirty needle. Yes, that's right, I forgot. Tell me, is it too soon to make jokes about that? - A little. - Of course. That's my bad. - How about now? - [CHUCKLING] - Will you stop that? - [LAUGHS] - BEN: Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late. - Hey. Just got off the flight from Sedona. You know, I found this outside the gate.
