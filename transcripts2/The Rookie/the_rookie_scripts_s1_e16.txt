 He's clean. See? Just out for a stroll. A stroll? It is sad the way you guys are harassing an innocent man. Officer Nolan, are you familiar with the Crack Almanac? - Is it available on Kindle? - Four basic principles... Look Out, Cook Out, Cash Out, Stash Out. Cook out... cook cocaine into crack. - Look out... - For the cops. You really could stand to work on that one. Stash out.

I can't believe we don't get a single vacation or personal day during our entire probationary year. It's how we prove our commitment. Wearing wool in August isn't enough? Why are you so cheery? I'm just livin' my best life. Oh. - Jessica. - Jessica. No. Yeah, okay, a little. - Yes, yes, yeah, a little. - Yeah. That's great. You... You seem really happy. - Thank you. - Oh, we should do a double date. I'd love for you to meet Gino. Sounds great, but she's out of town right now. She's, uh, doing a lecture at the Department of Homeland Security. Can I have your attention? Let's go, Boots. Everyone, gather up. All right, guys, listen up. Internal Affairs will be conducting random integrity tests this week. Reversals. That's right, Officer West. What's a reversal? Where cops go undercover to rat out other cops. IA officers will be spending the week pretending to be criminals so they can analyze how we treat them. So, what Tim said. Do you think this is a joke, Officer Lopez? Officer Bradford? - No, ma'am. - No, ma'am. Good. 'Cause I take it very seriously. If you have to change your behavior because of these reversals, we have a problem. My officers do things the right way... every day. Is that understood? Yes, ma'am. Dismissed. Are reversals really that hard to spot? I mean, you can usually make a cop by the way they walk. Not these guys. They train for this. It's like the Super Bowl to them. They go all-in. About two years ago, they took over a bank and masqueraded as robbers just to test our response time. They cleared the bank out first. Every teller and customer was a plant. That's dedicated. No, it's a waste of time and resources, which is why I make it my mission to seek and destroy reversals. I don't see what the fuss is about. A cop should be held to the highest standards. Of course you side with IA. Your dad's in charge. Okay, it's not about my dad. The integrity of a co... - Hey. - Morning. Here to see a client? Yeah. I won't keep you. Did... Did you guys break up? No. We had... a few dates. Then we stopped. Sounds like a breakup to me. - What happened? - Nothing. - It's fine. Let's go. - Okay. 7-Adam-15, disturbance at the Altobello Hotel. You're saying this is my fault? You're damn right it's your fault! Do you have any idea how much my car costs? Please, ma'am. If we could take this inside... What seems to be the problem here? Valet destroyed my car. - That car? - Yeah, look, the paint job. Right there. That scratch will buff right out. - You're lying. He's lying! - This is a civil matter. Feel free to take photographs and send it in for an insurance claim. You mean you're not gonna arrest him? There's no crime here, ma'am. Oh, like hell there isn't. I know you did it on purpose, too! 'Cause I caught you starting at my ass when I gave you the car. I see nicer asses on the regular. No! Let go! - Oh! - Drop that knife! - Oh! - Let go of me! I'm sorry. Sorry about that. Whoa. Sorry about that. I didn't mean for that to happen. Yeah, right. Is that how you get off? You handcuff hot girls and rip off their clothes?! No, ma'am. I'm just saying, cops don't have the best reputation right now. And if these tests help the public trust us, isn't it worth it? And how are we supposed to trust each other if our fellow officers are trying to trick us into screwing up? I... ask myself that every day. That's different. I do it to make you a better cop, not betray you. You're, uh... Yes. It's me. ♪ Feel the groove ♪ - License and registration? - Yes, sir. Uh... I'm so sorry. I can't believe I did that. I-I've never run a stop sign before. I watch you on the red carpet. Like, all the time. It's always nice to meet a fan. Uh, Officer, is there any way you could let me slide on this one, or just let me off with a... with a stern warning? It's just that I'm really late right now, and I got a lot of people waiting for me on set. You ran a stop sign. We could arrest you for it. Arrest me? Come on. It's... It's a nice, quiet street. There's no harm done. You know, I could get you tickets to any big movie premiere you'd like, or is there a particular star you ever wanted to meet? Okay, sir, bribery of a public officer is in violation of co... What? Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Murphy. Officer Bradford. Nice touch, roping in a celebrity. Well, he had community service hours to work off. You thought we'd let him go 'cause he's famous? Had I known it was you, I would've put a strung-out cop behind the wheel. I know you have a soft spot. Hey, excuse me, does that mean I can go? Write him up. Reckless driving. Giving false information to a police officer. Disobedience to traffic signs. Unlawful act with a green air sticker. Driving with an obstructed view. Unnecessary use of horn. Failure to exercise caution when passing animals. Wha... Is he serious?! What if she's one of the reversals? It's not your fault her tacky dress broke when she tried to stab a guy. If she's IA, she'll report you used reasonable force given the threat. You think it's possible that the dress was designed to fail on contact? You know, like... those break-away pants? I'm gonna go finish the paperwork. Thanks, you guys. Right this way. Please, believe me, I did not mean to expose you like that. Um... The woman with the phone, I spoke to her. She was very reasonable. I watched her delete all the footage. You have no idea who I am, do you? Uh, you are Astrid Heisserer. Uh... No priors, no outstanding warrants. What's your name? John Nolan. Badge number. 25253. If you want to lodge a complaint, that is your right. Oh, I'm gonna lodge something... believe me. Yo, that's messed up. You went through Wesley's phone? I thought he was cheating on me. Cheating? You guys only went on a few dates. I knew you wouldn't understand. Oh, I understand, I just don't approve. And I understand that's not the tone to take with a T.O., - so I take it back. - Good. Except the "that's messed up" part. That, I stand by. Whoa. How much you wanna bet it's a reversal? That's pretty convincing drunk-driving. $20 it's legit. Driver, pull over now. Unless IA's recruiting out of grade school, I just made 20 bucks. Are you okay? Good. Get out. I can't. I have to get her to the hospital. She's dying. Lopez. My sister OD'd. Please... help her! - She's barely breathing. - Control, start RA to our location. Female, 20s, overdose. - Do you know what she took? - No. I'm sorry. - Pupils are pin points. - It's okay. It's probably heroin. Get the NARCAN. Come on, stay with us. Here you go. All right, step back. She's gonna be okay. This stuff will wake her right up, all right? It'll wake her right up. Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on. Come on. You got her help. You saved her. It's all right, just breathe. 7-Adam-19, 459 in progress, 117 Ayers. Police! We're coming in! ♪ Mother, I lie ♪ ♪ When I say I don't miss home ♪ Mushrooms? Hallucinogens. This is a grow house. Careful... these places are usually booby trapped. Oh, my God. See? Booby trapped. Please, just get this thing off of me. I-I don't think we should. He could've severed an artery. The paramedics will know what to do. No, no, no. We don't need to call anybody else. There's like half a million dollars' worth of mushrooms in here. We split it, you pretend you never saw me... everybody wins. Okay. - What?! - Really? Yeah. But I want 60%. So, call Detective Murphy and ask her if that's okay with Internal Affairs. Who? Wait, you think this is another reversal? - Two in two hours? - That's how they do it. They try and catch you when your guard is down. What are you talking about? Look, I've got to say, this is impressive FX work. But we are in Hollywood, so, how'd you do it? Hmm? Metal plates? Peg leg? Wait. Wait. What are you doing? What are you doing?! Calling your bluff. 7-Adam-19, we need an RA to 117 Ayers. 30-year-old male, severe trauma to left leg. You're lucky his leg's gonna be okay. If Murphy hadn't gotten in my head, that never would've happened. Blame the reversals, not me. What happened between you two? Did she investigate you or something? Indirectly. Is it Isabel? Look, Murphy was her investigating officer. Okay, but you're not Isabel, - so what's her beef with you? - Not your concern. Start the paperwork. - Everything okay? - Yes, ma'am. Um, we had a reversal, but Officer Bradford saw right through it, so... I heard. IA is stepping up their game using celebrities. Yeah. - Stay vigilant. - Mm. I wanted to say I really appreciated what you said earlier today... about cops doing the right thing every day. Is that because you're seeing evidence of officers acting otherwise? No. Not at all. I-I was just... Relax, Officer Chen. I'm not gonna ask you to narc on anyone. But part of protecting and serving is making sure you refuse to do anything that crosses a line. So if anybody is asking you to do so, - I expect you to come talk to me. - Yes, ma'am. Okay. Tell me, how's that new apartment working out? Oh. Uh, it's great. It's in a quiet neighborhood. There's lots of coffee shops, and people walking around. Comics? Yeah. Uh... I found it in the lost and found. And by lost and found, I mean my locker. Thanks. Yeah. So, what happens now? I... Your sister, she's... she's stable. Uh, no reason that she can't make a full recovery. Then it's up to her. But ODs have a way of, um, putting things into perspective. My mom OD'd three times before she died. Each time, she swore she was gonna get clean. Cassie and I found her when we went down for breakfast. She was blue. Yeah. You can't lose hope. Yeah. That's what everyone says. 'Cause it's true, Jake. Social Services is on their way to get you placed somewhere safe while your sister gets the help she needs. Okay? Sure. I'll be right back. Hey. Hold up. Can we talk? Okay. I need to explain something. My dad left when I was a kid. And my mom never really got past it. There was no one stable growing up in my life, so I guess what I'm trying to say is I think that's the reason why I-I... I went through your phone. - You sound like my clients. - What? Everybody's dad bailed. No one's mom was perfect. Doesn't change what you did. No, I know, but... You're a grown woman, so having a bad childhood isn't a valid excuse anymore. Look, I wish I could trust you again, but... I don't see how I can. I'm sorry. Tim was so convinced we caught another reversal, he pried open the bear trap. I've never seen someone actually pass out from pain before. That's tough. Not as bad as the helplessness in that kid's eyes. What about you? Good day? Bad day? I had to pry a psycho off a valet at a five-star hotel. Uh, her dress ripped as I was cuffing her, exposing her unmentionables. Boy, she was pissed. - Wow. - What? That was for sure a reversal. Yeah, dress was probably rigged... - like break-away pants. - Mmhmm. - That's what I thought! - Yeah? Oh. Okay, I see what you're doing. Can I get that to go, please? No, come on! Don't be like that. No, as much as I would love to keep telling war stories... Thank you, Dez... I have another full day of reversals tomorrow, and this rookie needs his beauty sleep. Hey. So, they canvassed the area. No one saw the shooter. He fired a couple hundred rounds. Yeah, no one's admitting they saw him. Yeah, patrol found the car he escaped in. It was reported stolen this afternoon. - SID is all over it. - Who'd you piss off? Clearly someone with access to heavy weaponry. I didn't recognize the guy. According to intelligence, you've been greenlit by Southern Front. - Greenlit? - Means they put a hit on you. How's a rookie get greenlit before me? I gotta step up my game. It's not a badge of honor. Violent white supremacist gang wants you dead, you're doing something right. I-I'm sorry, white supremacy gang and greenlit? W-Wh... What the hell is going on? Normally, gangs don't target cops... more trouble than it's worth. Unless a cop disrespects a gang member, then all bets are off. You arrested a woman today. Astrid Heisserer. Her dress broke. I-I embarrassed her. I thought she was IA. She's not. She's the baby mama of the leader of Southern Front, one of the most violent criminal enterprises in the country. And because of how you treated her, he authorized everyone in the gang to kill you. - What about Talia? - Yeah, what about me? Nolan is the one who put hands on her. He's the one they're after. How many Southern Front members are there? In the greater Los Angeles area? Several thousand. And protecting you will be our number-one priority. Step one is to get you off the streets. Come with me, Nolan. I'm gonna escort you home. K9 unit already swept the property. Owner coming home tonight? Uh, no, Ben left for New York yesterday. So, what's happening here? The DA approved a VARDA alarm. It bypasses 911, sends a red alert to all the cops in the area. So, what's next? That's up to you. I mean, I can't just go to work, right? I'd be endangering everyone who came within five feet of me. Being a cop is being at risk. So you're saying I should just... report for duty, act like nothing happened? I think we tell criminals what to do, not the other way around. - No matter the consequences? - No matter the consequences. But, look, it's up to you. No one is gonna judge you either way. Yeah, right. Nolan. This isn't about bravery. You have a family. Any cop who's ever worn a badge understands that. All set, Captain. Okay. It seems the system is up and armed. We have a unit parked out front. Try to get some sleep. Don't see that happening. No. - Thank you. - Have a good night. Hey. What are you doing here? Guard duty. I think we have that covered. Now it's extra covered. You call me directly if anything happens. Yes, ma'am. Okay. West and Chen reporting for duty. Guys, this is very sweet, but honestly, it's unnecessary. You'd do the same for us. So, how do you want to do this? Personally, I'd go with alternating two-hour shifts with a static position plus a rover. Oh, and I have earpieces and walkies, just so we can keep in constant contact. You got anything sweet? Yeah, I think there's some ice cream. - Mm. - Wait, guys. Guys! Look, come on. We need to stay focused. You know, the whole point of guard duty is that we take turns being up so everyone gets some sleep. You could've left at any time. Yep. No one would've given you grief. Yeah, right. - Ohh. - We got to get to the station. Our shift starts soon. - I should go in. - What... To work? Absolutely not. You're safest right here. We'll manage without you for a few weeks at work. What if it's longer than that? My training would be put on hold, I'd... stay a rookie while you guys moved up. We'd be separated. That's never gonna happen. This, uh... This will all be over soon. Yeah. And if it's not? Then it's... good you have a pool. All right. Everyone, settle down. Captain. Thank you for coming in... most of you on your day off. Till this is resolved, all overtime limits have been lifted. As you may know, Southern Front originated as a white supremacist prison gang about 15 years ago. Since then, they have branched out in a big way. Drugs, prostitution, extortion. But what sets them apart is their access to military weapons. Their leader, the so-called "King Midas," is currently serving three consecutive life sentences. His son, Cole, he controls the day-to-day operations on the street. But make no mistake, his father is pulling the strings. Lifting the greenlight would be a huge loss of face for Cole, so he's not gonna do it willingly. So, we gotta make this a business decision. We put a big enough hurt on their operation, they'll lift the greenlight. Sorry I'm late. Yesterday, Southern Front tried to kill one of our own. Today, we hit back. - What? - Nothing. Look, everyone else sees this big hero move, but I see your ego getting in the way of you doing the smart thing. Look. If you don't want to ride with me... It's not about my safety. It's about yours. You're risking your life to prove a point. Seems worth it to me... if you're making the right point. But there's no sense in taking a needless risk, which is why Officer Nolan will be staying far away from anything Southern Front related. And I'll be riding with him. Whether I agree with his decision or not, he's my rookie. And I'll take good care of him. Yes, ma'am. Riding with the captain. And I thought being greenlit was scary. I drive. Of course. Officer Nolan. - Keys. - Yes. How exactly are we hurting Midas' operation? By attacking Southern Front where they make all their money... the three Ts. Drug trafficking. Weapons trafficking. And sex trafficking. ♪ Circle up, circle up ♪ ♪ Circle servant serpents ♪ ♪ Peace we demanding to serve it up ♪ ♪ Stirrups on our certainty ♪ ♪ The tide will turn, we're turning up ♪ ♪ We're turning tides, no turning us ♪ ♪ The tide is high, the term is now ♪ ♪ The surf is up, the surge is us ♪ I'll handle processing. You get started on the asset paperwork. I still don't see how confiscating 20 gallons of lube is gonna get the gang to back off Nolan. Asset forfeiture is where we do the most damage today. Law says we can seize everything and anything connected to their illegal operation. Vehicles, merchandise, even the massage parlor. Well, so, why didn't we hit it last week? Vice knew that Southern Front owned that shop. 'Cause it's whack-a-mole. You take out one criminal enterprise, another one takes its place. Usually not a good use of our time. But today, that's exactly what we want. Make sure Southern Front's scared one of their competitors - is about to move in, a... - Move! Don't touch me, man! Come on! You gotta be kidding me. What the hell are you doing here? My job. Making sure cops don't break the law. One of our officers was greenlit. Came within seconds of being killed. When do you think that a cop's most likely to cross a line? When they're scared, angry, and want revenge. They might... I don't know... yell at a detective. How about I write you up for conduct unbecoming an officer? Knock yourself out. This is about Isabel, and you know it. You know, it is about Isabel. It's about the fact that you covered for her for months. - That's not true. - Oh, please. Any cop can tell an addict 10 miles out. You knew she was using, and you let her come to work every day with a loaded gun. You had an obligation to report her, and you didn't. Okay, that's a lie. But I'd expect nothing less from a cop like you. Uh, hey, I need you to come check something for me. I want to make sure I'm doing it by the book, okay? So, come on. Hey, you know what? If I were you, I'd ask for another T.O. Yeah, well, you're not me. Ma'am. I was told there was a cop coming with the authority to negotiate. Cut the crap. Only color you care about is green. And the LAPD has taken a lot of that from you today. Now, if you want to stop the bleeding, sit your ass down. Look, I reviewed the body cam footage. That girl tried to stab a guy right in front of my officer. He used minimal force to stop her... no disrespect was intended or shown. Your son is overreacting, and I don't think it's his first time. It's time for the adults to de-escalate matters. You been in the game long? Almost 20 years. Then you know I can't just rescind the greenlight. It's gotta come from Cole. Any other way, my guys don't respect him. Yeah. Sucks to be you. Let me be clear. I'm not here to negotiate. We cost you $1 million in lost revenue and three in seized assets. And we're just getting started. None of that matters without honor. You're way out on a ledge, Midas. In half a day, we shut down seven of your businesses, put 46 of your men behind bars, and just imagine the damage we can do tomorrow, when we start hitting your spots in San Diego, San Jose, Victorville. I can keep going. Your son... is about to destroy everything you built because his girlfriend yelled at him. Do the right thing... call off the greenlight. 7-Adam-15, possible 459 in progress, 1936 Kristol Lane. 7-Adam-15, show us responding. I hate this. Feels like everyone's fighting my battle for me. City still needs policing. Ah, that was... Exhilarating. I was gonna say "terrifying." Guess I better get used to that. You know, when I, uh... I was first stationed in Baghdad, I used to get these headaches. Took me a few days to realize it was 'cause my eyes kept darting around, looking for trouble. That's what it is. I didn't stop looking, but it does stop hurting. 7-Adam-15, go to channel 2 for Sergeant Grey. Copy. Andersen. It worked. Midas forced Cole to lift the greenlight. I guess you are back to being just another rookie. Thank God. Thank you, Sergeant. My pleasure. So, does that mean this little "Odd Couple" partnership is over? Hell no! We got a burglary call to take. 7-Adam-15, show us Code 6 on the burglary call. Be advised, we have an open door. Going in to clear. Nolan! Cover... Hey, there! Look who's awake. Packs quite a kick, doesn't it? It's got four times the voltage as LAPD uses. Could probably cook the eyeball right out of your skull. Okay, look, look, I did not intend to disrespect Astrid, okay? Or you, okay? And I would be happy to apologize. Too late for that now. Only way this ends is with you dead. Yeah, I, uh... I'd heard that you were dumb, but it is shocking to see it in person. - Dumb? - Dumb. Who lured you into an ambush with a false surrender? Does your father know that it was false? Huh, junior? I can't imagine that revelation's gonna go too well, huh? I think it'll go fine. Oh, he's dumber than I thought. What's my rank? - What? - What is my rank? Come on, you're the leader of the sixth-largest gang in all of California. Surely you can tell from my uniform what rank I am. Who the hell cares? You're going to. See, it's one thing to put a hit out on a rookie... - No offense. - None taken. But two bars? Oh, for crying out loud. And a badge that says "Captain"? You've just crossed a line that anybody with half a brain would run screaming from. A line that even your father might whack you for crossing. Understood? So, let me tell you how this is gonna go. You and your little goonies are gonna... No! Hey! Cole! Hurt me! Right? I'm the one you wanna hurt, right? Killing me, that's trouble you can handle, okay? But not her. You need to let her go. - Do you think I'm dumb, too? - No. No. No! No! No! No! If the line's already been crossed, then there's no going back. Which means neither of you are walking out of here. As long as your bodies never turn up, the murder can't be pinned on me. No, you're wrong. And Southern Front'll weather the storm. It's gonna be so much worse. You need to get her out of there now. Hey, listen. What about this? What if I... What if I made a video? I'll apologize to Astrid. You just have to let her up. I already told you that it's not gonna - work, man. It's done. - Hey, think about it. Me, like this, you standing over me? Come on, she'll eat it up. You'll get laid for weeks. Okay, yeah. Okay. Just get her out first. Right now. No, you got to make the video first. We're gonna tape it... take it... Come on! Yeah, here. You recording? Hey, baby girl, this is for you! Astrid, I apologize. I-I should not have laid my hands on you. You deserved more respect than that. I am sorry. Can we please let her up now? Nah, you got to do it again. You got to put some feeling into it. I didn't believe that. Come on, man! I didn't believe you! Do it again! No! Do another take right now! Say it with feeling! ♪♪ No! No! Cap... Come on! Come on. Come on. Come on! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, come on, come on! It was Cole. Officers! Order, arms. Execution, arms. I'm so sorry. You're gonna give up your son right now! The hell I am! He killed my captain! You got one chance to save him and what's left of your operation. Find out where he is and give him to me, or I'll burn your world to ash. Thanks. There'll be time for grief later. We have a job to finish. Midas gave up his son. We know where he's headed. Look, I know what's in your hearts. What you want to do more than anything. I'd be lying if I said I didn't want it, too. Word is... you kill a cop, you never see the inside of a cell. But that's... that's not what Captain Andersen would want. Killing this loser won't honor her memory. Doing our jobs will. And we owe it to her to do it the right way. Agreed? All right, let's go. All units, get ready. Airship has a visual. Two minutes out. You were right. I was selfish. I got her killed. No. Don't do that. Don't make this about you. She didn't die because of your choice. She died doing her job the only way she knew how. Look at it any other way, you diminish her. Look, you need to know that no matter what happens next... whether we arrest this guy or we kill him... - it won't make things better. - I know that. No. You only think you do. Please don't tell me to "use it"... the grief or the anger... to make myself a better cop. I can't handle that right now. - I wasn't going to. - Okay? Grief is grief. It's... It's a hole that can't be filled, but over time, it'll shrink enough so that you won't fall in every time you take a step. But trust me, if there's one thing you can use to make yourself a better cop, it'll be her life... not her death. One minute. Think this guy'll go down without a fight? I hope not. Hello? Hey. I heard what happened. I'm so sorry. Thanks. I-I really can't talk right now. I said a bunch of things earlier. They don't really matter right now. I want to be here for you. I want that, too. 20 seconds out. Get ready. Okay, I gotta go maybe shoot a guy. - Call you later. - What... Cole Midas, you are surrounded by the LAPD. Step out of the vehicle with your hands in the air. I've got a clean shot, Sarge! Get out of the damn car... now! Okay! I'm getting out! Don't shoot! Nolan, go arrest that man. It shouldn't be him. No, it needs to be. Hands on your head. Interlace your fingers. Eyes front. Don't move. ♪♪ ♪♪ Other hand. Over here. Ugh! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you - in a court of law. - Come on! We both know I won't live to stand trial. Yes, you will. Because the woman you killed taught us it's not our job to punish you. Just to see to it that you are. You coming? Wh... No, don't... What the hell is wrong with you? Captain's dead, and you're out here spying on us? Your watch commander called. Said his people were gonna do this right... wanted to make sure that we saw it. Sorry about your captain. I liked her. I also trashed the "conduct unbecoming" charge, so... You were right... that was bush league. Good. Wait. Look, I'm only... I'm only saying this because Andersen would want me to. But you were right, too. I knew Isabel was using in the end, and... I didn't say anything because I was trying to help her. She was my wife. How's she doing? Better. She's clean. I'm glad. Is everything okay? Yeah, for now. All right, back to work. What? First time I met the captain, I fell flat on my face. Bishop and Lopez sent me to her office, told me I needed to introduce myself before roll call. - You got punked. - That's exactly what she said. Tried to play it off, but she was way too smart for that. Yeah. She asked for you to be assigned to Mid-Wilshire. You know that? No. Why? She didn't even know me. She felt your experience would make you a valuable addition to our house. Guess I got a lot to live up to. We all do. We all do. Synchronized by srjanapala
