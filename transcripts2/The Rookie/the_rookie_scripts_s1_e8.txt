 I know about you and Nolan. When this gets out, and it will get out, it'll brand her. So if you care about her like you say you do, you wouldn't even put her in this position. Are you breaking up with me? Yeah, Lucy, I am. I was just notified that detectives made a drug bust. It's your wife. Isabel isn't a dealer. Bradford and Isabel were rookies together.

 So she's a cop? Was. Undercover narcotics. Who's Carson Holland? Carson stashed a kilo of heroin in my heating unit. You're facing 10 to 20. I'm sorry. 7-Adam-15, burglary in progress. 609 Hollywood Boulevard. Police! 7-Adam-15, in foot pursuit of a 459 suspect. Requesting backup. Dispatch, do you copy? Sometimes these old concrete buildings can block signal.

 Hey! - Show me your hands! - Do it now! Against the wall. Got me? Backpack down. Give me your right hand. Hold up. Where the hell are we? This door's locked. No other doors, no windows. What's that? A code. You've got to be kidding me. - What? - This is an escape room. Stay. A what? Where hipsters pay to be locked in a room filled with puzzles that they have to solve to get out. Yes. Yes, yes. That sounds like fun. Yeah, maybe on a day off, not after a long shift. No signal. Guess we're gonna have to solve the puzzles now. Sorry. Looks like this one requires three or more people. Forget it. The quicker we get out of here, the quicker I go to jail. So I'm happy to spend the night. That's okay. You wouldn't have been much use anyway. What's that supposed to mean? Don't worry. We can just wait till they open up again in the morning. I mean, eight hours will just fly by. Absolutely not. It's a cipher. Maybe a Caesar shift. Caesar what? Didn't you take Whitman's extra credit class at the academy? No, I was gonna but I... "The first step towards freedom lies in the last step from captivity." What are you, some kind of secret genius? It's not a secret. Captivity. Greenwich. Harbledown. Harbledown. Canterbury. Canterbury. "Pallida mors aequo..." Is it another code? It's Latin. "Pale death knocks with the same tempo upon the huts of the poor and the towers of Kings." Catholic school. Towers of Kings. Skeleton's missing a rib. Nice! You're holding back. I wish I was. Okay. Okay. Okay. I could watch this all day. And now I can. Are you recording this? Yeah, just for, teaching purposes. Focus. Ooh! There you go! Nice takedown, Nolan. Thanks. Lucky move. I don't know what to say. You worked really hard for this. You deserve it. Thank you. I'll sign up for the detective's exam today. You should thank Wolfe and Vestri. They're pulling for you. I got the Tap. I heard. Congrats. Don't forget about us when you get your detective's badge. I'm sorry, do I know you? Insufferable already. You'll fit right in. Hey, I mean, it's not a done deal yet. I still have to take the exam. Well, we both know that if the detectives want you, you're in. Hey, are we good? I know you wanted it, too. Of course. I'm happy for you. What's going on? Talia just got the Tap. No kidding. That's great. What is she doing back here? What the hell's going on? They were supposed to hand her to the D.A. for prosecution. Your wife made a deal to be a confidential informant. What? She has a lot of contacts on the street. Because she's a drug addict. With police training. Which will get her killed if someone finds out. They won't let that happen. At least this way she stays out of prison. I heard Talia got the Tap. You okay? I'm fine. She's my friend. I'm happy for her. Whoo! Yeah, baby! Come on. She's comin' round the outside, going down... All right, race is over. Get off. Did I win? Sure. Have you been drinking, ma'am? No. I'm high. You're under arrest. What? I paid for this ride. Get down. Okay. What the hell is that? Looks like a foot. The real question is, why? Why what? Why do you have a dead foot? It fell off. Of who? My boyfriend. He had gangrene. And you're keeping it because it reminds you of him? No. I thought I could sell it. All right. Come on. Grab the foot. You're not gonna puke on me, are you, Boot? No, ma'am. I'm glad that my discomfort is cheering you up. Me too. Dispatch, show us Code 6 and on location. How many times has this alarm gone off in the last month? Six that I see. Thanks. We'll check the premises and advise. You gonna miss all this when you're a fancy detective? Not at all. What about me? Even less. Don't you move. Dispatch, 7-Adam-15. We have a woman with a gun. Requesting backup. Who wants to try me? Don't move. Put the gun down. They tried to rob me. Drop the gun now. Take the one on the left. Get down! There's nowhere to go. Stop! Where are your keys? I need a car! Drop the gun! Put it down! Get out of the house. Get outside. Go, go, go. Drop the gun! Don't move. Drop the gun! 7-Adam-15, shots fired. One suspect down. Requesting R.A. and a supervisor. Copy. Starting Code 3 fire and ambulance. 7-Adam-15. Negative on the ambulance. Suspect is deceased. Notify the watch commander. Copy. Time of death? Time of death 0955 hours. He pulled a gun... We can't talk about this until after we're both questioned. It could compromise the investigation. Right. Of course. So, what's next? It's a homicide. I'll secure the scene, preserve the evidence. Homicide, right. What should I do? Nothing. You're the suspect. Wait in the hall. You did the right thing, letting them find Isabel's drugs. They weren't hers. She's in this situation because she let herself get taken advantage of. Do you really believe that? It's an officer-involved shooting. It's Nolan. Officer Nolan? Officer Nolan. Yes. How many shots, from which direction? He was standing over there, I was here. I'm only able to ask two questions at this time... "How many shots, from which direction?" One. Two? One. That way. Your companion officer? To guide you through the process. Anyone you want. It's your choice. Grey. I-I want Grey. Is that all right? That's perfect. He'll take you to the station. Do I get the foot back? - No. - Fine. I still have the other one. - Hey, what's up? - Booking's closed. We got a bus in the garage to take everyone to county. Why? What's going on? There was a shooting. Things feel, um, really strange. Time is all over the place. Tachypsychia. It's a common response to a traumatic event. You'll feel better after you've slept. So, what now? Now you meet with your lawyer, put together your written statement. Union rep is on his way. He wants to go over a few things. Then there's the interview, conducted by Internal Affairs, with the lead homicide detective, district attorney, and the independent police auditor in attendance. Lot of people. Just tell the truth to the best of your ability. It'll be fine. End of shift? No. They're here to answer some questions. About you. How would you characterize Officer Nolan? Officer Nolan is one of the finest people I've ever known. Back at the academy, when everyone was gunning for each other, he'd stay up late and help you study, even if that meant bombing the test himself. Is he on any medication? Not that I know of. I think he has allergies. Has Officer Nolan ever talked about wanting to use force? Wanting to? No. Is he going through anything in his personal life? I mean, isn't everyone? Anything traumatic? Death of a parent? Breakup? Interpersonal conflict? No. Where's my brother? Why isn't he here? Your brother was involved in a shooting. Is he in the hospital? I'm afraid that's all I can tell you at this time. Hey, no, no, no. Is he dead? Is he dead? Come on. Bishop. You okay? Yeah. How's Nolan? Hasn't really hit him yet. Have you ever... Taken a life? No. Me either. Thanks for looking out for him. You should go home. And do what? Watch TV? Order in? I need to get to work. I need to focus on something else. All right. In that case, report to Vestri and Wolfe. They're working a big case, and you need to get your feet wet if you're going to take the detective's exam. Yes, sir. Captain. Commander West. Please, come in. Thank you. It's good to see you again. You too. Anything I should know as the investigation begins? Officer Nolan and his T.O. responded to a 211 at a convenience store. He pursued an armed robber into an occupied house. Fired one shot. Hopefully it's as straightforward as it sounds. Is this the first officer under your command to take a life? Yes. But you've been through the process yourself. You read my file, Commander. Back when my son was assigned here. I understand that he and Nolan are pretty tight. Officer Nolan's pretty close with both of his fellow rookies. You like him? I admire what he's trying to do. Okay. I'll keep you updated about the investigation. Dad. When I got the call about your station, I was worried it was you. I'm okay. If it had been me, I'd handle it. I know. You know, Nolan's a great officer. I'm sure it's a good shoot. That's what I'm here to determine. You don't know who to call. Can it wait? The PIO will be briefing the press soon. You don't want your family to hear about this on the news. Who can handle a call like this? Sarah. My ex-wife. Sarah, it's me. Hey, I've been meaning to call. Did you look at Henry's course load next semester? Yeah, listen... I'm worried he's over-extending himself. Sarah, I... It's not the number of credits. It's the difficulty. Sarah, you're gonna see some things on the news. I want you to know I'm fine. And tell Henry I'm fine. John, what's going on? I killed someone. What? On the job. I killed someone. Civil liability is covered up to $2 million under your plan. I'm sorry. I don't... I'm a little... Who are you? Simon Paige, your union rep. What? If you don't remember, say you don't remember. Under no circumstances do you express guilt. But I feel terrible. Guilt implies you did something wrong. Now, they're gonna tell you your statement can't be used against you in a murder trial. Technically true, but it can and will be used against you in any civil proceeding. Right. You were saying, about a civil trial? Is that likely? Quite. If liability exceeds $2 million, your wages will be garnished, pursuant to... To subdivision F of California Government Code Section 3303 or as otherwise required by law. You're Jackson's dad. We met at graduation. Yes, we did. But right now, I'm the head of Internal Affairs, and you're being interviewed about a shooting that happened earlier today. Right. Yes, sir. Sorry. Now, do you understand your rights as I've described them? No. Only civilians have the right to remain silent. If you choose not to answer any of my questions, you will no longer be a cop. Understand? I understand. Let's begin. Did you have any less-than-lethal weapons available? Taser? Pepper spray? Yes. Did you attempt to use any of these less-than-lethal weapons? No. Why not? I'm not sure. I didn't have time. You're not sure or you didn't have time? I-I didn't have time. My hand was on my gun. I couldn't reach for my Taser. Did you have cover or concealment? No. Did the suspect discharge his firearm? No. How many rounds did you fire? - One. - What were you aiming at? Him, his chest. Center mass, like we were trained. Did you hit what you were aiming at? Yes. Describe what he did or what you saw to make you think you struck the suspect. There was blood. He fell. Finally, appreciating that police work involves rapidly changing and dangerous, fluid environments, is there anything you would have done differently? What are you doing here? I'm helping out the detectives today. You got the Tap? Yeah. Congratulations. I know how much you wanted it. Look, I know this is weird. I was at your wedding... Officer Bishop, thanks for joining us. Thanks for having confidence in me. You're all caught up to speed on the case? Our C.I.'s boyfriend, Carson, is a low-level dealer. He gets his drugs from Marcus Vance. We've been trying to get eyes on him for years. And this is our opportunity. When is the next time Carson plans on meeting with Vance? Um, tomorrow night at some motel. He's gonna buy another kilo. Can you get him to take you along? What? You want me to wear a wire? I-I-I thought you wanted information. What's the best way to get information? I've never gone with him on a buy before. I can't just ask out of the blue. It'll look suspicious. So be convincing. Maybe we should start slower. Sending her into a buy to make her certified reliable... - That's as slow as it gets. - You don't understand. Carson's paranoid. H-He'll know something's up. Then we'll have to get him to think it was his idea. I can't imagine what Nolan's going through. Can you? Yeah. My second year as a T.O., a prisoner transport went sideways. My Boot didn't search the suspect properly, lost her gun. The guy would've killed us both if I hadn't pulled the trigger. What happened to the Boot? I don't know. She wasn't a cop after that. Is there anything anyone said or did that helped you through it? No. I just had to make my peace with it. Don't leave town. You must be available for questioning within an hour of notification. And remember, you can talk to your fellow officers, but they could be called in to testify about anything you say. So think about whether you want to drag them into this. I understand, sir. Hey. Are you all right? Yeah. Feel like I haven't seen you in years. Is there anything you need? Ready to go? Yeah. Everybody will do their jobs. I'm sure it'll be over shortly. Just go get some sleep. Thanks. Nolan. The rest of them would have told me I did the right thing whether I did or not. I knew if I asked you, you'd tell me the truth. So, why haven't you asked me? I don't think I'm ready to hear the answer. He had a gun on you. He refused repeated orders to surrender. I would've done exactly what you did. Get outside. Go, go, go. Drop the gun! Put it down! Don't move. 7-Adam 15. Suspect is deceased. - What should I do? - You're the suspect. Is there anything you would have done differently? That's Isabel's boyfriend? Our girl's fallen off a long way since Bradford. Come on. Carson Miller. I know you? Nope. But I know you. Come on. Let's go. Hands on the car. Why? I didn't do anything. You're on parole, Carson. We can search you whenever we want. Hope you didn't have plans today. - Do you have a minute? - Of course. Come in. Get the door. How are you doing? Good. No. That's... That's not true at all. There was something I was hoping you could help me with. Um... I wanted to see my body-cam footage of the event, if that's okay. You have a right to see it. But honestly, I don't think you should. Look, I've been where you are now. It was an alley instead of a bedroom, rapist instead of a robber, but the results were the same. I understand that you want answers, but watching the body-cam footage, I don't think you're ready for how traumatic that can be. I need to see it. Okay. Drop the gun! Put it down! Get out of the house. Get outside. Go, go, go. Drop the gun! Don't move. Drop the gun! He was scared. Maybe he wasn't gonna pull the trigger. Maybe I could have talked him down another way. Hey. That's not what I saw. You think he was gonna kill me? I think you did exactly what we trained you to do when you saw that your life was in jeopardy. Thank you. One more thing. The other robber, Kyle Montgomery, posted bail this morning. He gave an interview stating that you killed his brother in cold blood. Now, obviously, we know that the facts don't match his version. John, I want you to know that the department has your back, 100%. Thank you. Hey, it's me. We got trouble. What happened? I got pinched with drugs on me. A lot? Enough to keep me from meeting Vance tonight. Can you reschedule? No. You don't reschedule with a man like that. God, you're an idiot. Yeah. Okay, fine. I got it. Hey, um, is there someone else you trust to go instead? You know, maybe... maybe Rusty? Rusty's an even bigger idiot than you. Damn it. You're gonna have to do it. No way. If I don't pay Vance back, I'm dead. So you're gonna do this. Yeah. Fine, okay. I'll do it. Good work. We'll get you out of here once we take your boyfriend to the courthouse. Hey. Are you sure you're up for tonight? No. But I can't go to prison, so guess I have to be. Have you heard from Nolan? Not since yesterday. You? No. I didn't know if I should call. Maybe he needs us to reach out. I don't know. He'll tell us what he needs. You didn't. That was different, okay? I was ashamed. Maybe he is, too. The Rooks were asking how they can help Nolan. I found heavy drinking really helped knock out the nightmares. Maybe keep that to yourself. Detective Talia graces us with her presence. Yeah, it breaks my heart to see you out of uniform. You seem... shorter. I need to talk to you. Come on, Boot! How is she? Not good. I can only imagine how you've been handling... I don't need to commiserate. I need to know what's going on. If the detectives know I revealed anything about the operation... Then don't. They want Isabel to wear a wire to a drug deal. Tonight. A wire? Why don't they just shoot in her in the head and be done with it? Be a hell of a lot quicker. Excuse us. You enter my office again without knocking, I will put you on admin leave without pay. Is that understood? You can't let them do this, all right? She's an ex-cop. As if being an informant wasn't enough, now they want her to buy a kilo of heroin wearing a wire? I looked at her file. She took part in dozens of drug busts when she was a narcotics detective. This is different. Explain to me how it is that you know the details of their operation. You don't know her like I do, okay? You've read her file. You know who she was. I know who she is now. And the Isabel in that file is gone. I'm sorry. All I can do now is put you on rescue detail. If the deal goes south, you will be the first in the door. I'm sorry I barged in. It won't happen again. John. Hey. Hey. How long have you been standing here? People are staring. Yeah, I get that a lot. Tell me what's going on. I can't. If I talk to you about it, they could call you to testify. Then I'll testify you're one of the best people I know. I can't stop thinking about it. I was so amped up chasing that guy, and then he turned, and then he was dead. What if I can't get past this, Luce? What... How will I ever do the job again? Um... You know what? I'm sorry. I should go. Hey. No, no, no, no. Um... Come with me. Yeah? Done with the investigation? For now. Don't suppose you could tell me anything. You know I can't. Yeah. Hey. Can I, um, take you to dinner? Told your mother I'd take her. I mean, you both can come. I don't think she's ready for that. Um, see you at church? Looking forward to it. What are we doing here? I can't imagine what you're going through. And maybe if I was in the same place, I'd think about quitting, too. But... they're alive because you did your job. You put your own life at risk to protect them, and if you're ever in that position again, I know you'll do the same thing. Um... Thank you very much for the ride and, the therapy session. Of course. Um... Can I make you a drink? I could, whip you up a cappuccino. Really? No. I don't know how to work the machine. I hate it. I'm a little scared of it. Maybe next time. Yeah. No, of course. I'm sure you have someplace to be. Yeah. I should, um... Um... We'll be right here. Anything goes wrong, we'll be inside in a heartbeat. We can call this off. I'm fine. No, you're not. This'll help. Methadone? Thank you. Hey, um, what... What happens after tonight? They won't arrest Vance immediately. They'll want to watch him for a while, make cases against the rest of his crew. His lieutenant, his supplier, the supplier's supplier. Yeah. This is never gonna end, is it? Stop! What are you doing? I want to remember this. Come on. This is our last day as fun, carefree single people. Only boredom and drudgery from here on out. I'm afraid so. It's in the vows. There's still time. Great. Yeah. Go. Hey. What are you doing here? Are you kidding? Hanging out near the airport is a normal Tuesday night for me. You'd be right here if the situations were reversed. And I brought fries. Thanks. You know, you'd have to be in an actual relationship for the situations to be reversed. What are you, my mother? Okay. Here we go. - Who are you? - Carson sent me. - She's nervous. - She's fine. She's done stuff like this before. Get out of here, junkie. Hey. I have the money that Carson owes Vance. Does he want it or not? You Vance? You got my money? - Yeah. - Count it. The money's all here. How fast can you move that? Couple of weeks. Good. Tell Carson next time he sends you to do his work for him, I'll assume you're in charge and put him in the ground. It's done. Just take the brick and go. Hey, wait. Um... we could move more than this. What the hell is she doing? Another kilo at least. Really? 'Cause Carson always said no to that much weight. What is she doing? If he sends for another kilo, we can follow his guys to their source. She wants to end this. Smart. No, desperate. Gonna make him suspicious. Okay. I'll get you another kilo. But you'll have to wait. Sure. I got no place else to be. This place got a mini-bar? We should go in now. Negative. We wait for the drop. That was... A mistake. A fun, never-going-to-happen-again mistake. Right. Yeah. Exactly. Agreed. I know you from someplace? I don't think so. I do. You look really familiar. I'm an addict, and you're a dealer, so I'm sure we've crossed paths. He's on to her. He knows she was a cop. It's a big city. He could have seen her anywhere. Or she busted one of his friends back in the day. Could be. Maybe you just have one of those faces. Sure. Yeah. I, get that all the time. What happened? We lost signal. - We lost her. - No, no, no, no, no, no. It's probably just a glitch. Or he's on to her. We need to go in! All units, hold position! He's on to her. I'm going in. No. It's just a glitch, Tim. Hold position. All units, hold. Damn it. Go. Go, go. Police! Clear! They must have gone out the back. - You did this! - Hey, hey! - You did this! - Hey! - You! - Hey! - Come here! - Calm down! Calm down! What if it wasn't a mistake? What? I'm gonna make something to eat. Do you want something? Not for me. Thank you. Lucy? Hey. You know who I am? You're Kyle Montgomery. You're Alex's brother. No! No, no, no, no, no. I don't got a brother no more. You killed him. I didn't have a choice. He was gonna shoot me. You're a liar! He wouldn't have hurt anybody. You can't know that. You weren't in the roo...
