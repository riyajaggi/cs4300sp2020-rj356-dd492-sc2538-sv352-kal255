 Uh, three months on the force. Just... My I.D. is locked in the cab. - You're a rookie? - Yeah. Now I know you're lying. Get on your knees. Do it. [HANDCUFFS RATTLING] Dad? - ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, ♪ ♪ oh, whoa, oh, oh ♪ - Henry! ♪ NOLAN: Welcome to L.A. - ♪ I'm gonna win for you ♪ - Ow! That's tight. That's tight. ♪ Like I know you want me to do ♪ ♪ ♪ HENRY: [CHUCKLES] Oh. It's a good thing I still had your spare key, or you'd be in jail. - NOLAN: Airport jail. - HENRY: [LAUGHS] NOLAN: So, you sure you're okay Ubering home from here? Yeah, of course. I mean, you can't be late for your shift. But I'm not leaving until I see you in uniform. Yeah, this isn't the kind of job where we can hang out a lot, you know? HENRY: Oh, I know, uh... if you don't want me here, I can go. Not at all. I'm just a little under the microscope. They literally evaluate me at the end of every shift. Are you worried I'll make you look bad? No, that's... Okay, let me, um, get a fresh start here. Obviously, the threat of airport jail has me a little off my game. I am thrilled to have you here, okay? - Okay. - Just maybe don't tell any embarrassing stories about me. Mm, that's gonna be hard. There are so many. - Really, there's not, though. - Yeah. My sixth birthday. Easter 2009. - The turducken. - Do not tell that story. - [LAUGHING] Oh. - What story? Hey! Jackson and Lucy, this is... - JACKSON: Henry. What's up, bro? - LUCY: Hey! Nice to see you. - You guys know my son? - Yeah, on, uh, social media. Yeah, I-I followed them after you guys started hanging out together at the Academy. They followed me back. LUCY: You know what? That photo that you posted earlier from the plane was horrifying. - JACKSON: Dude, I literally almost puked. - LUCY: Thanks for that. HENRY: Okay, the guy in the next aisle over straight up cleaned his dentures on the tray table. - Gross. - It was bad. Wait, how come you didn't tell me you were friends with my son on the Insta thing? Well, it didn't seem like a big deal. Yeah. It's 2019, Dad. Get with the times. - [CHUCKLES] - Yeah. Dad. - [LAUGHS] - JACKSON: [LAUGHS] - That was a good one. - Yeah, thank you. Yeah. SGT. GREY: All right. Look alive, look alive. SGT. GREY: Officer Nolan, you ready? - NOLAN: -Yes, sir. - SGT. GREY: Good. Now, answer me this. What is your favorite part about the job? And don't say "To make a difference." I wasn't going to. But it is. - What's your least favorite? - Oh, that's easy. Paperwork. Imagine how I feel. - [OFFICERS MURMURING] - CAPTAIN ANDERSEN: All right. Most of what a captain does is paperwork. 'Cause of that, I feel like I've lost touch with what being a cop is really about. People. Captain Andersen: It's not only the citizens that we serve and protect. It's every single one of you in this room. CAPTAIN ANDERSEN: So, to remedy that, I've decided Sergeant Grey and I are gonna ride patrol today. TIM: Together? No. We're each gonna ride with a rookie, and their respective T.O.s will pair up. Ma'am, I'd be honored if you'd ride with me. That is sweet, Officer West, but today I'm riding with Officer Chen. Sergeant Grey, I'd be honored if you rode with Officer West today. That's cute, Officer Nolan. But you know my heart belongs to you. Lucky me. TIM: Lot of weight on your shoulders today, Boot. LUCY: Why? What do you mean? TALIA: Riding with the captain is a huge responsibility. TALIA: If anything happens to her, well... TALIA: I don't even know how to finish that sentence. TIM: I do. Andersen gets a scratch, and you'll be working motor pool in Sylmar till you die of carbon monoxide poisoning. JACKSON: Why do you think Lucy and Nolan got picked over me? Two words... body odor. I'm serious. It means something, doesn't it? Andersen's clearly playing favorites - riding with Lucy. - Maybe. But do you really think Nolan is Grey's favorite? - No. - Then stop worrying so much. - [CELLPHONE BUZZES] - Leave me alone! - Okay. Dropping it. - Not you. [SIGHS] My phone. - Or, rather, my mom. - What'd she do? She wants to know if I'm bringing a date to my brother's wedding. That sounds... reasonable. Not when there's extras on it. - Meaning? - If I don't bring a date, she'll spend the whole night trying to set me up - with the best man, Hugo. - Mm. I'm guessing Hugo's not your type. He smells like kitty litter. And I don't even think he owns a cat. Spent my niece's baptism bragging about how much he squats. Maybe he squats kitty litter. You're not helping. ♪ ♪ [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] NOLAN: Hey. Sorry to keep you waiting. - What do you think? - HENRY: Awesome. [LAUGHS] Oh. That belt looks super uncomfortable, though. Yeah, I have a bruise where the gun digs into my hip. - You made a friend. - HENRY: Yeah. Dominique was just giving me the scoop on this place. - Her dad works here. - Oh, really? Yeah. He's the watch commander. Your dad is Sergeant Grey? SGT. GREY: Officer Nolan. Why aren't you getting our gear? I was just getting my son squared away. He just flew in this morning from college. - Dominique? - Hey, Dad. You forgot I was interning here today, didn't you? No. I intern at different divisions on Saturdays. - Oh, for college. - SGT. GREY: High school. My daughter's a senior in high school. Wait, why did you tell Henry's dad to get your gear? Are you riding patrol? Captain's orders. Really? - Does Mom know? - Haven't told her yet. Well, I'm happy not to tell her, too. Long as you don't tell her about that "C" I got in Macrobiology. You know that's not the way we do things in our house. - So that's a "No"? - We'll talk about it later. - Officer Nolan, let's go. - NOLAN: Yes, sir. It's a 12-hour shift, so I'll probably be late. - Okay. - Oh, he can stay here with me, if he wants. That way, you two can have lunch together. That's okay, right, Dad? - Sure. - HENRY: Great. Yeah. You can tell me all the things my dad doesn't want - me to know about his new job. - [LAUGHS] - Great. - Here. Give me some of these. HENRY: [CHUCKLES] I'll help you. DOMINIQUE: I would say there's a lot of stuff. HENRY: Give me a little bit. - So, you didn't get the gear? - Neither did you. Do I look like your boot? - You were once. - TALIA: For two weeks. A long time ago. So unless you have a time machine, it looks like we're at an impasse. [SCOFFS] I have an idea. ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? Oh, um, Officer Bradford told me to set up their shop, as well, so I'm just... Bradford, Bishop! ♪ ♪ Yes, Captain? Officer Chen is my boot today. Is that perfectly clear? - Yes, ma'am. - Get your gear. ♪ ♪ Thanks. ♪ ♪ You want to quiz me on procedure? Do I look like a game show host to you? Go find some crime. Make a difference in our community today. Maybe we should head for a rougher part of town. Are you saying only crime happens in low-income neighborhoods, Officer Nolan? No, sir. [TIRES SCREECH IN DISTANCE] Oh, all right. Here we go. Vehicle code violation. Ooh. What's your PC? Uh, well, take your pick. We have, uh, broken taillight, obstructed view... NOLAN: ...driving all over the place. Pull her over? Are you asking me or telling me? [SIREN WAILING] NOLAN: Control, this is 7-Adam-15. NOLAN: We are on a car stop, Toluca Lake and Ponca. NOLAN: California plate Tom-Union-Frank. George-Robert-Adam-Nora-Yellow. How close are you supposed to park to a suspect vehicle, Officer Nolan? Oh. Uh, one car length, more or less. - [BEEPING] - Sorry. [ENGINE REVS] Is this a felony stop now? No, sir. Sorry. Still probably a little too... [BEEPING] [ENGINE REVS] That's it. - This is embarrassing. - I'm feeling a little nervous. - Are you happy with your positioning? - I'm... Shouldn't I be? It's non-tactical. The engine block should be positioned at an angle just in case we have to take cover behind it. Sir, she's an elderly woman. - You don't agree? - I think you should plan for the worst. - Right. - But if you're happy with it, fine. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] NOLAN: Hello, there, ma'am. NOLAN: Uh, looks like you were swerving around the street a little bit, and I noticed you have a broken taillight. Can we talk on the sidewalk? I don't like you standing out there in the street like that. It's so dangerous. - NOLAN: Of course. Give you a hand? - Yeah. - Careful. - [SIGHS] - [SIGHS, LAUGHS] - All right. Nice and easy, - nice and slow. - Yeah. You know, I haven't had a ticket in 25 years. You seem like a nice man. Can you just let me off with a warning? Just this once? Make a decision, Boot. - I don't see why not. - GLADYS: [SIGHS] Just do me a favor... get that brake light fixed, and if you're gonna pick a side of the road, make sure it's the right side. Officer Nolan. Have you identified everyone in the vehicle? Oh, that's just my son. He's sleeping. Sir, can you step out of the car? GLADYS: He wasn't even driving. GLADYS: W-Why do you need to talk to him? I just need to identify everyone in the vehicle. - Sir. - [KNOCKS ON WINDOW] Step out of the car for me, would you? Thanks. Oh. W-Whoa. Labor must have been hell. Sir, I, uh, need your name and date of birth, please. Don't tell him a damn thing. Ma'am, he's required by law to give me that information. Run, Bryce! - [GRUNTS] - Don't even think about it. [NOLAN GROANING] -Sgt. GREY: Hands over your head. - BRYCE: [GROANS] - SGT. GREY: You, too, Grandma. - SGT. GREY: Officer Nolan. - NOLAN: Uh-huh? - How you doing? - Good. [SIREN WAILING] [PEOPLE ARGUING IN FARSI, CLATTERING] Hello? Police! [ARGUING CONTINUES] - [VASE SHATTERS, WOMAN SHOUTS] - CAPTAIN ANDERSEN: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! CAPTAIN ANDERSEN: Hey! Hey, enough! I'll call for an interpreter. [SPEAKING FARSI] _ [BOTH SPEAKING FARSI] _ _ [SPEAKING FARSI] Yes. Our marriage is over. I made a mistake of telling him he could come by and get a few things. Then he starts destroying the whole house! Nothing we shared matters to her anymore. I love you, Mehrnaz. Why are you throwing us away? I cannot keep doing this with you, Dariush. [SPEAKING FARSI] Sir, clearly, you're in a lot of pain, but what you need to do is get a lawyer, see a judge, and they will help you to divide your property. Lawyers? Judges? Strangers! My wife is leaving me. My life is over. Ma'am, do you want to press charges? No. I just want him out. CAPTAIN ANDERSEN: Officer Chen, can you escort Mr. Ghorbani outside, please? Come on. [SIGHS] LUCY: Hey! He's got a gun in the master bedroom. Officer Chen, there's a gun upstairs! Stay right there. ♪ ♪ [DOOR SLAMS, LOCK CLICKS] - What do we do? - Straddle the door. Talk him out of there. Try not to get shot. ♪ ♪ Mr. Ghorbani, I need you to come out now. [DOOR HANDLE RATTLES] [SPEAKING FARSI] _ [GUNSHOT, THUD] ♪ ♪ [GUN RATTLES] CAPTAIN ANDERSEN: Uh, so, it's just all the way up these stairs and straight back Thank you. All units, be advised, we're Code 4 here. Situation's under control. [SPEAKING FARSI] Is this my fault? Should I have given him another chance? You couldn't have known that he was gonna react like that. There's no way. My mother is still in Iran. She told me to work things out, that marriage is sacred. But we were so unhappy. [SOBS] It's just... You know, my mother said the same thing to me when my marriage ended. She lives in La Cañada. You can't control how people are gonna react. I wish we could. ♪ ♪ [SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE] Captain? Reinforcements just showed up. JACKSON: Captain. Anything we can do to help? Yeah. You can get your ass back out on the street and handle some calls. We heard there were shots fired. Did you also hear Officer Chen put out the all-clear? Did you think you were gonna pop by for a little moral support? Did you want to come inside, maybe check the fridge? No, ma'am. I-I just figured... The woman inside just watched her husband take his own life. I don't think she's in the mood to host a party. What do you think? Understood. We'll go back out on patrol. Sorry. I think they were just trying to help. - We didn't need it. - Yeah. I... I let the guy get upstairs. Yes, you did. He's not dead because of that. - [BUZZER] - NOLAN: That lady is crazy strong. And who'd have thought she'd have more outstanding warrants than her Sasquatch kid? [CHUCKLING] By the way you're walking, I'd say she could kick field goals for the Rams. Don't remind me. [SIGHS] She does this on purpose. Just to push my buttons. Well, that's what kids do. So, why wouldn't your wife be happy with you riding patrol? My wife is not your concern. And after your performance this morning, I'd say you need to focus on the job. - Yes, sir. - Let's go. JACKSON: I mean, how could we not respond? JACKSON: It was a shots-fired call. Did the captain ask for backup? - No. But... - But nothing. She's not a damsel in distress. If that were Grey, would you have insisted we ride in like the cavalry? And now you created a real problem, instead of the fake one you made up in your head. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] WESLEY: Stop that guy! He's getting away! Hey, stop! - Let go of me. - Calm down. Calm down? I was just chasing the guy that stole my briefcase, but you let him get away. And, by the way, you're supposed to identify yourself before you engage a suspect. "A," I had no way of knowing you were the victim here, and "B," I didn't have time to identify myself due to the immediacy of the situation. Try that on someone who isn't a lawyer. Do you want to file a report on your briefcase or keep telling me how to do my job? Well, I don't have all day, so I guess I'll file a report. JACKSON: How about I take care of the report and you go enjoy your coffee? I have a locator in my briefcase. If we go now, I can track it. Yeah, we can't just wander around on a scavenger hunt. Okay, can you give us a second, please? Yeah. ♪ ♪ Look, maybe we should help him. Otherwise, I bet he'll file a complaint. Fine. But if he gives me any more attitude, he's gonna taste pepper spray. - LOPEZ: Let's go. - JACKSON: Let's go. Yeah. This is gonna go great. TIM: All right. I'll be contact, you be cover. You don't trust me to be contact? Fine. You be contact, I'll be cover. Don't do me any favors. - What's going on? - You called 911... - But you said... - Said I was gonna be con... Never mind. - Go ahead. - Okay. What's the problem? MARGARET: We've had some recent break-ins. We had one last night. I went to do laundry just now, and someone's hiding in the basement. - Are you sure it's not a tenant? - Yes. I shouted, and he didn't say anything. But I know he is still down there. Okay. We'll check it out. Go wait in your apartment. [KEYS JINGLE] ♪ ♪ - Downward-facing stairway... - Stairway, downward facing... - I'm calling this. - Of course you are. TIM: I do have more experience. You take point, Officer Bishop. I'll hook left. TALIA: Oh, so now it's "Officer Bishop," huh? Mm. Fine. After you. - LAP... - Police. - TIM: LAPD! - TALIA: Police! ♪ ♪ Looks clear so far. You just keep holding point. It's a box, Tim. There's no one here. Stick to the S.O.P.s, just like I taught you. "Standard Operating Procedures" also means use common sense. My T.O. after you was big on common sense. Officer Belgrave's safety tactics are for crap. Oh, here we go. The great SWAT debate. There's no debate. There's a right way and a wrong way. - [CLATTERING] - TIM: He's in there. You breach the door. I'll take point from here. Dynamic entry. Remember to get clear of the fatal funnel. You breach the door. I breached the last one. And we should use the "wedge and slow search" technique. [SCOFFS] ♪ ♪ [CLATTERING] Behind the panel. ♪ ♪ Suspect. LAPD. We hear you in there. Slowly open the door and show us your hands. Control, 7-Adam-15, we have a possible 459 suspect at our location. Send us another unit. Why'd you call for backup? If we can't handle one mope, we shouldn't be doing this job. - What if it's not just a mope? - If it's not a mope, he wouldn't be hiding in there. - Now, breach that door. - What for? He's not going anywhere. Time's on our side. Officer Bishop, do I need to remind you I'm senior officer on scene? Which means I'm in charge. Now, breach that door. ♪ ♪ - [SPRAY HISSES] - Aah! Aah! - What? What? - Aah! Skunk, skunk! Oh, hell no! [GRUNTS] ROB: You don't even have a parking permit. Move your car. JAVIER: Well, what are you gonna do, make me? ROB: I got to make you? What, are you 12 years old? ROB: Look how you parked the car, my man! ROB: Take my keys and do it for me. - CAPTAIN ANDERSEN: Gentlemen. - ROB: Oh, you gonna walk because the police is here now? CAPTAIN ANDERSEN: Gentlemen!! Hey, hey, hey. - What seems to be the problem? - This is my spot. Screw that. He stole it from me. JAVIER: Man, the hell I did. I got here first, and he cut me off. Okay. Okay. I-I don't understand. It's a parking spot. Just get another one. My daughter is having a party. I have the cake in the trunk. All right. The game's about to start.

If we had done a wedge and a slow search, you would've seen from a safe distance. Give me the keys. Let me drive. - I'll get us there faster. - Forget that. There's no way I'm letting you in my shop smelling like that. Then what the hell am I supposed to do? Oh, now you want my advice. Well, here it is. Call a cab. [COUGHS] JACKSON: So, what's in the briefcase that's so important? WESLEY: Handwritten depositions. If I lose them, my client could go to jail. LOPEZ: Maybe your client belongs in jail. - Why handwritten? - Protects my clients' privacy. I don't trust the cloud with anything important. - [CELLPHONE BEEPS] - Wait, wait. He should be right around the corner. WESLEY: Hey. LOPEZ: Police! Stop! - [GRUNTS] - [MAN GRUNTS] WESLEY: Hey, hey. Take it easy. - What? - You don't have to be so rough. You're criticizing my arrest? 'Cause I was expecting a thank-you for getting your briefcase back. The law defines excessive force as a use of force greater than that which a reasonable officer would use under the circumstances. - He makes a good point. - Nobody's talking to you. Are you gonna read him his rig... I will if you shut up for a minute. - JACKSON: I'll do it. - [SIGHS] What the hell is your problem? For starters, your blatant disregard - for the man's civil rights. - That man is a criminal I apprehended based on your description. You're a police officer. Why am I describing due process to you? You don't need to describe anything to me. Mm-hmm. Three words... protect and serve. - Two words... shut up. - WESLEY: I'm not gonna shut up. - WESLEY: You do something dumb... - Oh, wow. They really dig each other, huh? - Are you crazy? - No, no. Look how close they're standing. - I want to slap you in the face. - Yeah, you... My ex and I used to scream at each other just like that. - It was hot. - WESLEY: Go ahead. I can take it. - Huh. - WESLEY: I'm a witness to that. DISPATCH: Wilshire units, 415 possible assault at 7293 Citrus, apartment 601. NOLAN: How much of the job do you share with your family? NOLAN: Only because the social aspect of being a cop is a vital part of my education. I share what I can. It's a lot easier now that I'm anchored at the station. What do you mean, what you can? What we do isn't normal, Officer Nolan. Situations we find ourselves in... Sharing too much can be counterproductive. - For them or for you? - Both. Here we go. Oh, it's about time. It's like World War III next door. The arguing, the fighting. NOLAN: Ma'am, I don't hear anything. Oh, not now. Probably killed each other. SGT. GREY: Okay. We'll check it out, ma'am. If you don't mind going to your apartment, please? SGT. GREY: Thank you. Open up. Police. You want me to kick it in? - Are you saying I can't? - No. I mean yes. I... Step aside.

Seriously, though, if you have any more questions, I'm happy to give you the scoop anytime. I just might take you up on that. So, why is it such a big deal that your dad's out riding patrol? He got shot when I was in middle school. Almost died. Took him a few months to get back on his feet, even longer than that to feel like Dad again. So, I'm assuming having our kids see us like this - would be counterproductive? - Very. So, we'll just hit the locker room and get cleaned up first. ♪ ♪ Too late. If I hadn't seen you like this, would you have told me about the fight? Yeah. No. [STAMMERS] Look. It's not a big deal. It was a little scuffle. And my job is to protect you from the bad things, which includes some of what I do on the job. I'm not a kid anymore, Dad. I'm going to college in a few months. Are you gonna shadow me across campus? Don't think I haven't considered it. Look, I'm trying. Okay? But to me, you're still my baby girl. No, I'm not, Dad. That's just how you want to see me. Well, you wanted to see me in uniform. Don't. It's not funny. You were literally covered in blood. Yeah, but somebody else's blood. Uh, t-this job, Henry, I-it's hard to talk about. It... Harder even than that "birds and the bees" conversation. I'm on the outside of your new life. Part of it is because I went to college. But you're the one who changed everything. HENRY: My whole life growing up, HENRY: you got up and you went to work and you came home every night, and I never had to worry that you wouldn't. But now you're a cop, and every time the phone rings, I panic and think something's happened. Henry, I'm sorry. I didn't know. Because I haven't said anything. Because you're happy for the first time in a long time. Hey, that's not true. I was happy. No, you weren't. The last few years with Mom, you both thought you were protecting me, but I could feel it. I hated that I was the one responsible for you both being so miserable. Hey, now. Your mom and I had our share of problems, but we were always on the same page about you. You were the one thing we did right. Mostly. ♪ ♪ Look, h-how about I change uniforms - and we go get something to eat? - I'm not hungry. ♪ ♪ I shouldn't have ducked. Relax. It was instinct. I should've been the one to duck. Guess I'm a little rusty. Well, it's understandable. I mean, you're stuck in your office most of the day. Actually, um, I didn't always push a desk. You know, I was in Marine Corps... MOS 5803. Military police. That's where I learned how to speak Farsi. Well, I didn't know you were in the Marines. I-I thought that you were just from another department back east somewhere. Did a year as Pentagon Police, Criminal Investigation Directorate. Then I moved back home... joined the LAPD. Moved up quickly because of my experience, but that means I didn't move through the ranks with these guys, so they don't see me as a cop, only as a boss. You should tell people about that. You sure as hell wouldn't have cops flying in to rescue you. You don't tell people that you're a badass, Officer Chen. Just got to show 'em. Hey, not for nothing, lady, - that shiner's pretty badass. - Shut your mouth. Don't say anything - without your lawyer present. [BUZZER] You're doing this to mess with us, right? The guy robbed you. Look, the theft of my briefcase and the use of force you used to apprehend him are two separate events. The wonderful thing about our legal system is... we both have rights. Whoa. What? Captain took a shot to the face. All right, all right. Show's over. Everybody get back to work. - Thank you. - [CELLPHONE BEEPING] Bad news? Uh, no, I just got to get these stats to the Chief. You know, actually, um, do you mind processing our friend till I get this done, and then we'll head back out? Well, I'm fine if you need to stay here, ma'am. I've got plenty of paperwork to do, so... I appreciate that, but... I've made a practice of finishing what I've started. ♪ ♪ LOPEZ: You need to go wait out in the bullpen. - What happened? - I ducked. LOPEZ: Oh, so he's your client now? WESLEY: Until his regular counsel shows up, yeah. Is that a problem? What's going on with Lopez and that guy? - WESLEY: Are you okay? - It's been a weird day. - WESLEY: You seem very stressed. - Mm-hmm. How you doing, Miller? Can I get your walk-in reports? I got to update the stat sheets. I got a question. Somebody will be with you in just a minute. I need some information regarding prison sentencing. What's your question? How much prison time for a bar fight? Depends on the severity of the, uh, injuries and your previous record. Why are you asking? Is murder really the only guarantee for a life sentence? Just get out? Yeah, a couple weeks ago. Let me guess. You were in there a long time. You having trouble, uh, adjusting on the outside? Nah. I'm good. I'm good. You walk into a police station asking questions about murder, you most certainly are not good. I strongly advise you not to do anything stupid. Don't worry about it. I know exactly what I'm doing. Let me see your hands! [WOMAN WHIMPERING] RAZOR: I kill her, I go back inside forever. MAN: He's got a gun! - RAZOR: I'll kill her. - CAPTAIN ANDERSEN: All right. CAPTAIN ANDERSEN: Look at me. Hey, hey! You don't want to do this. You don't have to do this. I told you. I'll do anything to go back inside. Trust me, you're going back in. I'm not looking to do a short fall.
