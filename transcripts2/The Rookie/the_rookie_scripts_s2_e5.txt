 Hey, what are you doing here? Abigail had a buttload of flyer miles, so we, uh, flew out to surprise you. Oh, my God. Abigail, it's so nice to finally meet you. It's great to meet you, too. The videos didn't do it justice. This place is a wreck. I think it's awesome. It's like a faded beauty queen that you're bringing back to life.

 Oh, wow. You are quickly becoming my favorite. Mine, too. Uh, we have some good news. Exciting. Lay it on me. I'm pregnant. Kidding. I'm I'm kidding. We're engaged. Sorry about the pregnant thing. I-I thought it would soften the blow. Abigail, uh, that is, um, is beautiful. That is a beautiful ri I hope you didn't, uh, spend your tuition money. I used the money that I was saving to go to Europe, because Abigail's the journey

 I want to spend the rest of my life on. Aww. Aww. That's so  That is  That's so... Does your mom know? She thought it would be best if I told you in person. Uh, yeah. She also recommended that we quickly follow the news with some electrolytes. That is...hilarious and entirely unnecessary. Have you set a date? Not yet, but we're, uh, we're talking about June. Isn't it exciting? It's so exciting. Crap! I feel like Goldilocks, except instead of "too hot" or "too cold," every guy I date is either, you know, "too frat-bro," or "too stick me with the check because you are never going to finish that screenplay working on your abs." Let's face it, I am never going to find someone. Yeah, not if you keep looking in hipster clubs and hot yoga studios. Ah. What you need is a grown man. I would just settle for a decent pickup line. Oh, thank God. Okay. Wow. We gotta go. Thank you. Mom. What are you doing here? Your father and I are getting divorced. Hi, Mrs. Chen. I'm so sorry. Oh, Jackson, sweetheart, thank you. What happened? I don't want to talk about it. Okay, is this like the time that you didn't talk to Dad for a week because he forgot your birthday? I said I don't want to talk about it. Oh. I'm sure my back will be fine. I assume you have extra bedding. Oh. Mom, you're not sleeping on the couch. I'll get you a hotel. Nonsense. No, I'll take the couch. Mrs. Chen, you can take my room. Such a sweet boy. Would you mind putting this in my room? I have to get ready for work. Is that really what you're wearing? Nice groupings. Thanks. So, I need yesterday's after-action reports. I will have them for you at the end of shift. You mean when today's are due? I know you're used to being out on the edge, all alone, but paperwork's part of the gig here. Copy that. I will get caught up quick. Officer Nolan's not the only one being evaluated, Detective. I know you got the golden ticket, but you got to do the work. Understand? Yes, sir. Henry got engaged. Yeah, he just turned 20. I know. It's too young. Didn't you get married around then? That's not the point. So, I just talked to my dad. Apparently, he only brought home a bagel for himself. He did not bring one for my mom. That's why she left? Bagel that broke the camel's back. Maybe it's for the best. Oh, God, no. Separately, they will make my life twice as miserable. I have to get them back together. Just... Morning. She is definitely warming up to me. So, Officer West, can you tell us what a "friendly" is? Yes, sir. A "friendly" is another term for a Confidential Informant. Correct. And Confidential Informants can be an incredibly useful tool. They're definitely tools. Are you saying you don't use them, Officer Bradford? No, sir. Just saying that they're lying liars who lie and they need to be dominated, never allowed to think they're in control. Officer Lopez, you agree? No, sir. C.I.s are most useful when they think they're part of the team. You're both wrong. Please, school us, Detective. C.I.s are just people trying to get by. Some are psychopaths who play ball because it's the best available option, some are people in over their heads who cling to you desperately as a way out of trouble. Treating them all the same is a mistake. Well, it's time to put these theories to the test. Nolan, Chen, part of the second phase of your training is developing your first C.I. See, you've known this day was coming, so I'm confident that you have a plan of action in place. But be forewarned  you will be evaluated on the arrests generated by your C.I., as well as their long-term viability. So, choose wisely. Alright, that's it. Be safe. Sir, you have to let West participate. Do I? You've read my daily evals. His work is as strong as it's ever been, and this is an opportunity to prove that he's ready to move on. It's a big swing, Officer West. Screw it up, it's likely to be the last nail. You sure you want to take that chance? Yes, sir. Alright. You're in. Good? Thank you, sir. You are the greatest T.O. in the history of T.O.s. Here you go. You got a choice to make  be conservative or be bold. Tim's gonna make sure Lucy bags a work horse for her first C.I. Nothing flashy. And Harper? My guess is she'll let Nolan drive it  sink or swim on his own. You think we should go big. It's the riskiest move, but the one that will get you into short sleeves quicker. But a big fish takes time, and if you fail to recruit him, you run the real risk of hitting the week's end without someone. And Grey'll bounce me for sure. Screw it. Let's go for it. That's the spirit. You got a candidate? Yeah. A guy the Feds use, but you should hit an ATM on the way over. This guy's not cheap. Hey, Nick. Heading home? My bed awaits. I just had an armed robbery suspect in the box all night. I'm fried. How're you? I just found out my son got engaged. Whoa. I-Isn't he, like, 12? 20. Right. You like the girl? Abigail. She seems very sweet. Just met her for the first time this morning. Also 20. You run her through the system? A background check? No, it's against the rules, and it's just...wrong. If it were me, I'd want to know. See you tomorrow. Well, technically tonight. -Right. -Here you go. Oh. What are we doing here, Boot? As you're aware, pawn shops are required by law to notify law enforcement if they believe someone is trying to pawn off stolen property. I pulled city records. This shop has never called us. Either the owner is a saint, or  Or he's dealing with a lot of stolen goods. Exactly. Making them the perfect candidate for my first C.I. Don't get too cocky, Officer Chen. Recruiting a reliable C.I. is hard work. Yes, sir. Sorry, my parents are... Uh, never mind. Morning. Good morning. What can I do for you? We're doing interviews for the detectives in Robbery-Homicide. Has anyone tried to pass off stolen items recently? No, absolutely not. How do you know they're not stolen before you buy them? 'Cause I'm a very good judge of people. What's your impression of me? That you're a very distrustful woman. Detective Harrison, it's Officer Chen. Yeah, we're gonna need you to send Code Enforcement down to High-Life  That's not necessary. Hold on, Craig. If you're above board, there shouldn't be a problem, right? Okay. There may be a few things that are from questionable sources. Nice job. Great, let's see it, and don't give me any of that low-end misdemeanor crap. Woman brought this in yesterday, and it's not the first designer bag she's brought me. Mm. Retails for what? Five grand? Six. What are you looking for? These high-end bags have serial numbers sewn in. They're registered to the original buyer. Yeah. Bingo. Hey, there. Bianca, right? Do I know you? No, I have this acquaintance in narcotics. He, uh  Well, actually, I installed a new kitchen island for him. Anyway, I was telling him I need a low-level drug mule that I can flip into a C.I., and he mentioned you. Bianca! Why are you running? We know where you live. She's got drugs in her bag. Really? Uh-huh. Bianca, is that right? Easy. Okay. Easy. I got you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Relax, okay? Heroin? Yep. Enough to put Bianca in prison for the rest of her child-bearing years. Do you want to go to prison, Bianca? No. Then you're gonna have to flip on your boss, and depending on how that goes, you're gonna become an informant my informant  pointing us to more drug dealers and suppliers. I can't do that. They'll kill me. And we'll protect you. He can't promise you that. You need to be clear with a C.I. You'll do your best to treat them right, look out for them, but you're not God, and you're not with them 24/7. Understood. And thank you. So, those are your choices, Bianca. You can go to jail or you can help us. What's it gonna be? You're gonna get me killed. Hey, if anything happens, we'll be just across the courtyard. Your boss usually punctual? For a drug dealer. Look, don't be a hero. Just give him the bag, you take your fee, you walk away, just like you've done hundreds of times. All done. Talk in a normal voice. Tell the man at the funeral home that I want to be turned into a tree. Make sure they don't put me in a box. I get claustrophobic. Bianca, I promise... ...if anything goes wrong, we will be there. Can I go to the bathroom with this stuff? Sure. And don't listen. Hey, girl. I thought  Yeah, don't do that. He'll be here in a minute. Let's get set. Damn it. So, I was thinking we could start small, see what type of intel you have. Hold your roll, Officer. The only reason I'm talking to you is because you paid my greens' fee. Truth is, I work exclusively with the Feds. They pay way better than the LAPD. 100 grand last year for intel on nine high-profile felonies. Now, you gonna match that? While the LAPD can't beat that kind of number, your FBI handler isn't gonna give you the kind of personal attention that I will. He offering massages? There's got to be something or someone that's bothering you. My ex-wife is screwing this Pakistani guy. Owns a used car dealership on Van Nuys  definitely moving stolen cars. And why do you care? My ex torched all my Armani suits on the way out. So, you take something she cares about away from her... I'll play ball. He's here. He went into the room. She's going in. What's going on? It's fine. Let it play out. See? All good. Arms up. Hey, I don't get to keep that? Sorry. Alright, well, let's go get this guy. Okay, just sit here, relax. The hard part's done. Great job. Freeze. Police! Hands up. Drop the bag. Interlace your fingers behind your head. Don't move. Decent bust, rookie. Bianca? Hey. Bianca? Harper, I need Narcan in the room right now. Bianca. Hey. Stay with me, alright? Where'd she get the drugs? Must have had a leftover from the deal. Easy, easy, easy. I got you. I got you. Control, 7-Adam-15  We need an ambulance at the Dollar Motel on Olympic. Female, 25, head injury and overdose. Mrs? Uh, these officers want to speak with you. Cool. What's up? We're here about some stolen property. Do you recognize this bag? Yeah, I've got one just like it. We believe this one is yours. It was at a pawn shop. We matched the serial number to your credit card purchase. Hilda! Yes, Mrs? You're fired. What? Please, don't make a scene. It'll just upset me. Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. What's going on? What did you do? Hilda's been robbing us. I have not. Who are you? This is my daughter, Olivia. Step-daughter. You were 9 when I was born. Olivia, do you know anything about a stolen handbag? The description the pawn shop owner gave us fits you more than your housekeeper. Yeah. Yeah, I took it. But she has so many, she didn't even notice. You are such a brat. You're such a parasite. Don't talk to your mother that way. You are not my mother! Okay, calm down. Calm down. Both of you, okay? I want her arrested. It's the only way she'll learn. Are you sure that's what her father would want? Her father wants whatever I tell him. Six stolen cars. Grey's gonna be impressed, but we still need to get Hickey officially signed up. On it. Yo. Mr. Hickey, it's Officer West. Your intel was spot-on. We've impounded six stolen vehicles and arrested Mr. Fawad Chandio. That's awesome. Nicky's gonna cry for a week. So, it means you're on board? I'm a man of my word. Great. We'll just need you to come into the station and fill out some paperwork. Yeah, you got it. She'll be okay. We're gonna keep her overnight and monitor her for a concussion. Thanks. You know, I still don't understand how she overdosed while in custody. I left her alone while we made the bust. I just  I feel terrible. You two used to date. What? No What? No. YeWell, yes, but  I'm not judging. You're very pretty. Thank you. Well, I'm not uncomfortable at all, and I think we should probably go, right? Nice meeting you. You, too. So, are you counting Bianca as your first C.I.? Shouldn't I? Got a solid arrest off her intel. Yeah, but Grey's also evaluating long-term prospects and she doesn't have any. Right. Ever bother you using people like that? Nope. The drugs she's moving kill people every day. She's not a saint. She's a criminal. Right. You didn't answer my question. You checking that box and moving on? No. I need to find a real C.I. Good answer. So, where's your mom? Uh... She died last year. Cervical cancer. Oh. I'm sorry. Thanks. So, I left school to be with my dad, only to find out that he'd been hooking up with that trophy skank while my mom was in hospice. Yeah, well, you shouldn't go home tonight, once you process out. I don't have a choice. Daisy convinced my dad to hold on to the money my mom left me until after I graduate from college. Can he do that? I don't know. I can't really afford a lawyer to find out. Look, you are in a bad situation, but stealing, it's... it's not gonna make it better. What will? Am I crazy, or was that way too easy? It was a little easy. On the other hand, you showed Hickey that you can get things done. Lopez, West, my office. I'm gonna call you back. So, this is Special Agent Wyck Bird from the FBI. He says you're trying to poach his informant. Wait, sir, I-I can explain. Save your breath. Hickey's mine. Guy's a clearing house of high-value intel. Bureau doesn't need the LAPD messing with our meal ticket. I didn't know informants came with exclusive rights. Now you do. He called you to get us to back off. And he used us to do him a solid. Now he's kicking us to the curb. He said you were hassling him. Stop hassling him. Or else. Sergeant. Special Agent. Sir  Save it. I told you what would happen if you swung and missed. You're dismissed. So, you got a game plan for running down a new C.I.? Not yet. Any suggestions? Oh, that's right. You're not here to teach me. Ms. Harper? Hi. Uh...um, what are you doing here? You didn't sign your petition. Right. I'm sorry. I, um... Excuse me. Hi. John Nolan. Hi. Good to meet you. My name's  None of his business. Um...I'm gonna take 10, you figure out a next step. Come on. This is bleak. There's nowhere else we can meet? It's private. I don't want anyone here knowing my business. Okay. We got lucky with the judge. He believes whenever possible, it's important for the mother to be part of the child's life. Okay. That's That's great. How's it going here? Uh, it's fine. It's a lot harder than I thought it would be. What is? Being normal. You're doing great. The better hours, the new apartment  the judge will be impressed. I hope so. 'Cause if I don't see my daughter soon, I am gonna lose my mind. Hey. Hey, back at it already? Yeah, couldn't sleep. Just laid there, staring at the ceiling. Figured screw it  I'll clock in early. Can I ask you something? Yeah, sure. I need to recruit a C.I. My first one  she O.D.'d on me. Oh. You know what? You need a forger. They're at the hub of all criminal activity. Tell Logan in Commercial Crimes I asked him to throw some names your way. You are a life-saver. Thank you. Hey, John? Yeah? I ran a background check on Henry's girlfriend. Don't worry, I tied it to an open investigation. No one will ever know. I-I didn't ask  I know. I know. But if I were you, I'd want to take a look at what's inside. What's that? Nothing. What was your thing about? Nothing. Great. Lunch? Great. So, what do I do? Open it. It's about Henry's safety. You should see what it says. Dad. Hey! Oh, my God. You guys are all about the surprises this week. Hi, I'm Abigail  Henry's fiancée. Yeah, I know. I just really love saying that, so... Congratulations. Yeah, that's awesome. What do you want to eat? I'll come with you. Okay. Good. We'll be back. Right. May I take your order? They look so happy. I want that. Baby steps. Right. Well, first, I have to get my mother out of our apartment. Yes. They really do seem happy. Would I be sabotaging that by reading what's in this envelope, or is that the illusion and Abigail's just a time bomb waiting to go off? So, what's the next step on the C.I. front? Forger. Who'd you get that from? No one. Detective Armstrong. Cheating on me with another detective? I had no idea we were exclusive. Okay, we got too much, but everything looked so good. Perfect timing. Uh, uh, Henry, Abigail, this is Nyla Harper, my training officer. Nyla Harper, Henry is my son. And I know what you're thinking  far too young to have a 20-year-old. Nope. Nice to meet you both. Let's get to work. Right. Um, that's all you. See you guys at home. So, you got a place to start, or are we Googling "forger"? Ooh, I got a list. Mm. What did you think of Abigail? She seemed nice. Why? No reason. They just got engaged. Oh, good for them. Yeah. No? Yeah. No, I'm... Yeah. Oh. It's great. No, eh, eh... Drunk driving  Knock, knock. Officers. Can I help you? Beat it. This is your place? Yes, sir. You do head shots? We sure do. What about fake IDs? No, sir. Lying to a police officer  that's a crime, isn't it? Not as big a one as forgery and counterfeiting government documents. Just trying to make a living. These cellphone cameras have killed my business. Am I going to jail? Well, that depends. Maybe I can help you if you help me. I don't know what that means. Do you want me to bribe you? How much  No. No. No. That's not Okay. How do I... I need someone with their ear to the street  You're gonna be his snitch. My snitch. We're gonna take all this stolen property as evidence. We're gonna book it and tie it to an unknown suspect. If you screw us, we will suddenly know who the suspect is, get a warrant, and come arrest you. We are looking for leads on serious felons here, okay? Not teenagers trying to buy alcohol. You making papers for anyone like that right now? I did get a head's up about a big job that might come my way. Fake identities, driver's licenses, passports, the works. As soon as you get details, you call me. Do you understand? Yeah. Congrats. You have a real C.I. I'm on my way home now, Mom. Yes, I got the shopping list you texted. There's no milk because I'm lactose intolerant, remember? Mom, I gotta go. Opal, what's up? Thank you. Tim. Yo? Olivia showed up at Opal's pawn shop with more of her step-mom's stuff, but she didn't want money this time. She wanted a gun. Police! 7-Adam-19  shots fired at our location. Send back-up. I hate you! Drop the gun! You turned my dad against me! Olivia, drop the gun! She ruined everything! Now! Stand up. Keep your hands up. Do not move. You've made this so much worse. Come on. You are gonna pay for those bags. Ma'am, stay right there. What's going on? What the hell are you doing here? I came to get the rest of my things. WhAre you okay? Officers, would you like to see where Mrs. hides all her drugs? Yes. Yes, we would. I'm home! About time. It's way past your curfew. Oh, very funny. You have a lot of tattoos. Oh, yeah. You like 'em? Each one signifies a meaningful moment of my life. I'm trying to talk Henry into getting one. I have no idea what I would get. Yeah, well, that's a decision that will last you a lifetime. Yeah. Oh, I see what you did there, Is anyone hungry? I can tell you're freaked out. Don't be, okay? Okay. Okay. Hello? Hey, it's John. I really hope I'm not, um... stepping over the line here, but I really have no one to talk to about...anything parenting oriented. Never mind. You know what? I'll take care of this. Just forget I called. John, how can I help? I'm having a parenting emergency. Good thing I specialize in emergency medicine. Are you still at the hospital? Yeah, for a couple more hours. Could I come buy you a cup of coffee, ask you some questions? Of course. Thank you. I'm just gonna head right back out for a little while. Okay. Oh, could you pick up some pie? Yeah, she loves pie. I love pie. Sure. I feel like a monster. You're not a monster. I mean, you're a father. So, I should just open this up right now and read it? Absolutely not. But it's my job to protect him. It is your job to respect him, and running secret background check on the girl he's in love with is not doing that. Okay, but I didn't run this. Doesn't matter. No, no. Of course not. And yet, I still can't bring myself to throw it away. What if you read it? And then that way, you could just tell me if she's a serial killer or a mime. No, but I will throw it out for you. But  It's the right thing. Hey, if you want to know something about Abigail, you should just ask her. You're right. Thank you. You're welcome. I messed up. I tried to regain all the ground I lost, but it might have just cost me my job. You know, Lucy would tell me about you at the academy, how far ahead you were from all your classmates. Seems so long ago. What happened to that Jackson? What happened to that young man I met at graduation? So full of confidence. A lifetime of expectations crashed headlong into reality. Well, "Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn." Freud? Cat poster Lucy used to have in her room. You need to get back to the time when you knew who you were, not who you were trying to be. Oh, my gosh. You're absolutely right. I can't start counting up wins and losses when the season's just begun. Morning. Where did the coffee cups go? Oh, I moved them next to the coffee maker. I liked them by the dishwasher. That's ridiculous. It is more convenient. Did Did... Did you rearrange the furniture? Yes. There's a better flow in the room this way. That's... That's great. You know what? Screw the FBI. I'm gonna flip Hickey, take him away from the Feds, and show Grey that he's wrong about me. That's a really bad idea... but I love it. Yes. How you gonna pull it off? Okay, I-I stopped by the men's detention center on the way in, spoke to Chandio, and it turns out he's not sleeping with Hickey's ex-wife. He's never even met her. So, Hickey had another reason to torpedo the stolen car ring. Exactly. So, we find out what that is, and we can use it to leverage Hickey. They made contact last night. Ordered, um, five full sets of fake documents. All young women? Yeah. Human trafficking? Yeah. Who's the buyer? Cartel. Not sure which one. But they'll kill me if they find out I'm talking to you. Where's the exchange taking place? Uh, Whiteman Airfield. In two hours. You sure he said noon? Yeah, I wrote it down. 7-Adam-15  all units stand by off-site. Target is running late. Hold position until further notice. You think he's gonna show? If there's one thing you can count on, it's that criminals are always late. What? Nothing. What? Trent Silver. Name of the lawyer you were talking to at the precinct yesterday. I checked the sign-in sheet at the front desk. Why would you do that? I'm a cop. Curiosity's part of the job description. So, he does family law? He's none of your business. My personal life is none of your business. Why you're back in uniform? None of your business. Are we clear? For now. Son of a... Didn't someone from the FBI call and talk to you guys? I'm already taken.  Yeah, about that. After we swept up those stolen cars and shut down that dealership... And learned that you were lying about the owner sleeping with your ex... It got us thinking. So we did some digging, and it seems that you paid a visit to a few businesses in that neighborhood yesterday evening. Tried to use our show of force as a means to extort some hardworking men and women. We've got you on extortion. We own you. So, call the FBI and let them know that you are booked for the foreseeable future. Okay. Alright, sure. But I need to know how much you're gonna pay for tips. That's a fair question. Totally. The answer is... Zero. Zero. Hello? I read it. Read what? Wait... the background check? No. You threw that away. I saw you. I couldn't help myself. I mean, I dug it out of the trash after you left. No. Why? You're supposed to be the angel on my shoulder. But I started thinking. I mean, if this was my son, what would I do? And then the next thing I knew, I was tearing it open and reading what was inside. I-Is it bad? What does it say? Two years ago, Abigail was charged with arson and use of a caustic substance against a former boyfriend. I'm sorry. Nolan. Heads up. I have to go. 7-Adam-15  target has arrived. Single black SUV. Wait for our signal. Nice and easy. Just go give them the documents. Police! Hands where I can see them! Get out of the car! Do it now! No, please. You're making a mistake. Are you being held against your will? Not by him. He's helping us escape. Wait. Escape from who? El Leon. Head of the Aquino Cartel? He's my husband, and these woman "belong" to his men, but we're finished putting up with the abuse. You have to let us go. Who is that? It's my husband. He keeps calling, telling me to go back. You brought your phone? Guaranteed he's tracking that. We gotta get out of here. Get behind us. 7-Adam-15, converge on me. Code 3. Anybody raises the gun above their waist gets a hollow point in the eye. There's no need for that. We're simply here to give the ladies a ride home. You the husband? Nah. I'm his attack dog. Elena, why do you do this? You know there's no place to go. Get in the car. All of you. We won't. Oh, yes, you will. No, they won't. Huh. There's eight of us... ...and two of you. Actually, there's a whole lot more than two. So, here's the new plan  You, your boys are gonna get back in your cars and you're gonna drive away, empty-handed. I'd say you got about 20 seconds before the cavalry arrives. This isn't over, Elena. We'll get to you soon enough. Well, that was exciting. I guess not for you. That's probably a regular Tuesday for you. Oh, no. The pucker factor was definitely at 11. West. Nolan, Chen, don't wander off. Special Agent Bird just called me  Look, Sergeant, it was my decision to pursue Hickey and try and steal him away from the Feds. Seems like you succeeded from the way Bird was yelling. Yes, sir. Officer Lopez, is this how you train your rookies? To ignore the orders of federal agents? Pretty much, sir. Any day we can remind our federal brethren that we are their equals... is a day worth living. It appears you three successfully recruited your first C.I.s, and I'm impressed. See you tomorrow. Oh, Officer West? Short sleeves, please. Yes, sir. Hey, why's your bag by the door? Your father is on his way to pick me up. He apologized. He just needed to miss me. Oh. He's downstairs. Alright, sweetheart, it's been a lovely visit. Come by the office. We can talk about why you're not dating anyone. Thank you, Jackson. Bye, Mrs. Chen. No wonder I can't find a healthy relationship. My dysfunctional parents are why I am 28 and still single. Are you sure that's why? What's that supposed to mean? Look, I'm just saying that your only real relationship was with Nolan. Yep. I've known the whole time. Wait  Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? You think I'm stupid? No. Listen You fell for a divorced guy coming out of a 20-year marriage, okay? I-It was safe. Never meant to last. Come on. Let's go celebrate. Tomorrow, my forearms will be liberated. It is pretty glorious. Yeah, actually, how did you get your parents to make up? Oh. I got Wesley to call each of them pretending to be a divorce lawyer, telling them the costs of a divorce, and that snapped them out of it pretty quick. Well played. Thank you. Let's go. Wait. Will you please, please help me get the furniture back to where it was. But it's better this way. I know. But will you help me get it back to the way it was? Yes. Oh. Thank you. Yeah.  Thanks. Guys, there's something I need to say. I know about the arson. You ran a background check? You knew she had a record? Yeah, she told me on our third date. I...can't believe you did that. It's okay. He He did it to protect you. No, I don't need protecting, especially from you. Do you want to know what happened? If you want to tell me. An ex-boyfriend posted some videos on the Internet... after we broke up. Personal videos of us... together. He did it to get revenge, and it worked. He took something from me I'll never get back. I'm so sorry. So, I went to his house... and I torched his car. And I got arrested and he didn't. Happy now? Not in the least. Abigail... ...I'm sorry my fear overcame my judgement. I, uh... I can't take that back, but I can promise you it won't happen again. That's good enough for me. Yeah. Okay. It's great that that's behind us now, because I really am pregnant. I'm kidding. Again. Oh, my  Joke. Geez. Okay, we're gonna have to work on the jokes, though. 'Cause I already have a high-stress job, and, uh...I think you're gonna give me a heart attack.
