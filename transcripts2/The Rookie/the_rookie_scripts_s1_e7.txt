 At 11:15 this morning, the LAPD engaged in a pursuit of Number One on the FBI's Most Wanted list. All departmental resources were brought to bear on this dangerous fugitive, including our most decorated officer, Kaydence Patton. On your knees, dirt bag. Hands behind your back. Dirt bag? Ow! On behalf of Make-A-Wish, the City of Los Angeles, and the LAPD, we hereby thank,

 Honorary Police Officer Kaydence Patton. Considered one of the ocean's greatest predators, the great white is a solitary creature. Always on the hunt, the shark glides through icy depths and coastal wat... So, just to be clear, since I left you three days ago, I flew to New York, went to a board meeting, two Broadway shows, a charity gala, and you haven't moved. Moving is overrated. Huh. You said you had plans. Right?

 Too many to come to New York with me. Yeah, I lied about that. And you told me to embrace being on my own. I didn't mean become a hermit. You need to put yourself out there, meet new people. I do. I meet dozens of new people, every day on patrol. And you arrest them. Speaking of, I have got to get to work. I'm just trying to look out for you. I know, and... and I appreciate it. I just... I'm not feeling really social right now. How many times you check Lucy's Instagram page? None. 11. John, L.A. is full of distractions. Find yourself one. 'Cause Lucy's not going anywhere. You need to move on. What? - Morning. - Hey. Where were you this weekend? We, uh, hit up a Dodger game and went to that pop-up karaoke disco. Uh, my back was bothering me, so I just stayed home to take care of it. Well, cowboy up next time, 'cause we can't be the Three Amigos with just two people. Right? Yeah, totally. All right, grab your seats. A special day here at Mid-Wilshire. In fact, we're gonna start off by playing a game I like to call: "What is a patrol officer's least favorite assignment?" Officer Lopez, why don't you get us started. Easy. Guarding a dead body. Solid one. Officer Bradford? Canvassing in the rain. Bishop. Driving the drunk wagon. It's just nasty. Without a doubt. And yet, for me, the absolute worst is... the VIP ride along. Why? That sounds like fun. Officer Bishop, would you like to inform your Boot why the ride along tops my list? Because if anything happens to your VIP, it's your ass. So, you take the lowest of low-risk calls. It makes a 12-hour shift feel twice as long. Plus, you're trapped in a car all day with an entitled prima donna coated in body spray. Officer Nolan, you want to take a guess why we're playing this game? Because you're giving me the VIP ride along? - No. - Really? No. You absolutely got the ride along. He's waiting in the Captain's office for you now. Sir, is it too late to ask for a sick day? - Yes, it is. - Uh, who is this VIP, anyway? Thank you so much - for allowing this. - Of course. LAPD always appreciates when Hollywood gets it right. Ah, no danger of that with me, huh? No, I-I'm just moving this movie franchise of mine from New York to L.A., so I thought I should get out on the street here, see how L.A.'s finest get things done. What movie is that? It's "Trading Fire." And if Five is half as good as Four, I will be a happy man. Mr. Payne, meet Officers Talia Bishop and John Nolan. You'll be riding with them today. - It's a pleasure. - I am such a huge fan. Oh, I'm so excited to be riding along with the oldest rookie in the world. I don't... uh, well, I wouldn't say world. - Don't sell yourself short, James. - John. Captain, once again, thank you so much for allowing this. I know the rules of the ride along. I'll be happy with whatever level of calls you give us. I appreciate that, but we will make sure that you get to see some action. Great. Great. He does not get anywhere near danger. Is that understood? Yes, ma'am. It is such an honor to be the one... So, what's it gonna cost me to get to see some real action, huh? And don't forget I have what they call "stupid money." If you don't put that away, this ride along is gonna be over before it even starts. Tough negotiator, huh? She's not negotiating. - I heard a rumor. - About what? My dad said a detective position is opening up, and you and Talia are top contenders. So, I would keep an eye out for The Tap. What do you know about The Tap? It's how the higher-ups signal that you're a shoo-in for detective. "Officer, you should think about taking the exam." Wink, wink. I am so ready to move up. Did your dad say anything else? Anything I can use to get a leg up over Talia? No. Mnh-mnh. Listen, I really shouldn't have told you that. Don't worry. I won't say anything. But I definitely appreciate the heads up. 7-Adam-7, reporting a possible assault in progress. Sounds like someone's getting killed. Police! Open up! - What the hell are you doing? - Nothing. - Uh, no, I've... - I've heard of this before. Did you shock yourself so you can feel an adrenaline rush? Dude, y-you should try it. It really just clears the sinuses. Where did all this stuff come from? The Jason bought it from a friend. Really? And where exactly does your friend work? The... hospital store. Okay. Look, The Jason is gonna put on The Handcuffs, because he's under arrest. Hold up, Boot. We're not looking to arrest this guy. We're not? Not if he can point us towards someone more worthy of jail. How about it? I can make the charges go away, but to do that, I need to know the name of the guy you got all this stolen equipment from. S-Sorry. The battery was dead, so they had to find us another shop, and then I had to put gas in it. But we're ready to roll now, so... You know, when I was a rookie, I got here two hours before roll call to get the best shop from motor pool, re-wash it, and load the gear. Is this the cop version of walking five miles in the snow? This isn't story time, Boot. I'm reminding you how easy you have it. Understood, sir. Thank you for all your support. Officer Bradford, Sergeant Grey wants to see you in his office. Get the shop set up. - I'll be right back. - Here you go. Does this vest make me look fat? What, are you kidding? You look like you're ready to star in "Trading Fire Five." Yeah, I've been training with these special forces guys. Oh, the same guys who trained Tom for the last movie? I watch all the behind-the-scenes videos. Wilshire units, we have shots fired, MacArthur Park. Let's go to that. Guys, let's go to that. I've got Lakers tickets with your name on them if you say yes. Sorry, I'm a Clippers gal. Jonah, can you help me out, please? Me? Um... sorry. The T.O. dictates which calls we take. 7-Adam-15, possible 459 at 910 Seabright Place. What's a 459? 7-Adam-15 responding. What's a 459? Real, authentic police work. Yeah. Come in. That's not a good sign. No, it's not. Look, there's no easy way to say this. I was just notified that detectives made a drug bust. I recognized the suspect's name. It's your wife. What's the charge? Possession with intent to sell. They're bringing her in? Yeah. I don't know all the details yet, but I wanted to warn you. So, obviously, this is a complicated situation, but know that the department has your back. Whatever you need, just ask, okay? Yes, sir. Really? We passed up a shoot-out for this? Well, the neighbors reported hearing disturbing noises. - That could be serious. - Huh. Doubtful. Listen, you want to see the difference between New York cops - and L.A. ones, right? - Yep. Well, New York has 40,000 officers policing their streets. L.A. only has 9,000 operating in a city twice its size. We see a hell of a lot more action every shift. Yeah, you never know when that action's gonna happen. Some of these "smaller" calls can get ugly fast. Matter of fact, just to be safe, you should really just hang back. To be safe. - LAPD! - Police! Bishop. LAPD. Show me your hands. Oh, she's been there a while. And no one noticed. Hey, what's, uh... what's going on? What did Grey want? Are we going out? Detectives. After you drop off, can you come back and see me? Thanks. Hey. You have an issue with our arrest? No, just looking for more details on this one. We assisted on a DEA task force, tracking a heroin distribution network. They flagged a car known to make drops for them. We pulled over the suspect and found four grams, individually wrapped, which means intent to sell. - Isabel isn't a dealer. - How do you know? Officer Bradford and Isabel were rookies together. So she's a cop? Was. Undercover narcotics. Another division. Been off the job for a year. You used to date. She's my wife. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Fact of the matter is she's in pretty deep with some heavy dealers. Being arrested with that kind of weight, she's looking at one to three in county. I know that, but she doesn't even own a car. You bother to check the registration? Doesn't matter. She was the one driving. Look, this is not something that we can make go away... even if we wanted to. Your wife's gonna need a lawyer. And your officer needs to figure out where he stands. Is he a cop or a suspect's husband? - Thank you. - Yeah. He's right. Listen, why don't you take a personal day, all right? Make some phone calls. It's not necessary. They need to process her. Then they're gonna wait for her lawyer to show up, and then they're gonna sweat her in interrogation. You won't get a chance to talk to her for hours. So if you don't take a day, that means you're going back on the street. You have a problem with that? No, sir. Okay. Go back to work. Yeah, her name is Crawford. Collette Crawford. Just looking for any relatives or family friends. Latanaprost. L-A-T-A-N-A-P-R-O-S-T. Could you check again? Uh, there has to be somebody. Hey, can we go? Psst. Can we go? No, I need to get a Natural Causes Death Certificate issued first, and to do that, I need to go through all the medications with the medical examiner. Well, can I just pay them to do it so we can go? No, you can't just throw money at your problems to make them go away. That's not how life works. Maybe not your life. Nolan. Uh, yeah, okay, thank you. Okay, look, I-I get this isn't exciting for you, but it's important, and I know I, for one, will sleep better tonight knowing that we took care of Ms. Crawford's remains personally. Can I give you a note? A what? You're coming across a little earnest. Just try throwing it away a little more. Throwing it... - You do know. - I'm a real person, right? - Yeah, Nifedipine. - God, she's just so beautiful. She'd never be a leading lady today, though. Not unless she lost 30 pounds and had a nose job. That's the trouble with this business. It's so superficial. Yes, well, you could buck that, you know. You have the power to hire whoever you want. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But, you know, audiences expect a certain look from my films. You know, I wouldn't want to disappoint them. Thank you. Yeah, well, there is definitely a dark side to auto-paying all your bills. I couldn't find a single relative or family friend to claim the body. - That's so heartbreaking. - Doesn't surprise me. People forget you fast in this town. We caught you with a van full of stolen medical equipment. At least twenty grand worth, which makes it a major felony. How'd you guys find out about me? Come on! Somebody gave me up. I'm too smart to get caught any other way. But are you smart enough to walk out of this room a free man? What are you doing? Offering up a deal. But this is a good arrest. But there's a better one right up the food chain. Isn't that right, Chuy? Maybe. Make that a "yes," you might sleep in your own bed tonight. I'm just saying New York cops would've, you know, shown me a little bit of a better time by now. If you're unhappy with the quality of your ride along, please feel free to request another unit. Look, I'm not happy. You're not happy, either. You don't want to be taking these low-risk calls any more than I do. With all due respect, I don't think you could handle high-stakes calls. Oh, yeah, is that a challenge? No, just an observation. - I've seen one of your movies. - What, you didn't like it? It was fine. It just had nothing to do with real cop work. 7-Adam-15, we have a 415 at 9386 9th Avenue. What's a 415? Family disturbance. Probably just a loud argument. It's not that far from here. 7-Adam-15 responding. Yeah. - No! Relax. - Everybody makes mistakes, bro. - It's cool. Just chill. - No! Go! Ty. Yo, you're scaring her, man, come on. Everybody makes mistakes. Just chill. Finally, some action. - You, stay. - No! - Ty, Ty, it'll be okay. - Shut up! Everybody, put your hands where I can see them. Go. Go. - Hey, back off. We don't need you here. - Go! Hey, Ma, I told you not to call the cops. - No! No! Go away! - Yo, they gonna shoot him! - Nobody's shooting anybody. - Go! Everybody, put your hands where I can see them now. Go away! Now. Knife! Put the knife down! Sir, drop the weapon now. - No! No! No! No! No! No! - Wait, wait, wait! Put the knife down! - Put the weapon down now! - I need you to put the knife down now. - Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him. - Tyson, it's okay. Put down the knife, please. I did bad. Tyson did bad. Sir, we are just here to help you, but we can't help until you drop that knife. Go. Go! He doesn't understand. Please. He's not gonna hurt anyone. He's only a child. - He doesn't know how big he is. - Look, I won't let you hurt him. I need you to step back now. Everyone, take it down a notch. Ty. Ty. He got confused. The alarm. I-I shouldn't have yelled at him. Could somebody take care of that alarm? I'm sorry, Momma, I'm so sorry... It's okay, baby. I know you didn't mean to hurt me. I know! I burnt the pancakes. I burnt the pancakes. Looks like you didn't flip them in time. I forgot. I forgot. I forgot! I do that sometimes, too. You know? Forget when to flip them. You want to know a little trick? How to know when to flip 'em? You remember the little bubbles on top? Hmm? When you see those little bubbles on top, you know it's time. Okay? Okay. I need you to put down the knife, Tyson. Now. Okay? Sorry... - It's okay. - It's all right. Isn't public urination usually a citation? You need to brush up on your California Penal Code. Section 314. Indecent exposure is a misdemeanor subject to six months in jail. Hmm. Indecent exposure requires an offended party. Plenty of offended families living in the apartment building across that alley. Mm. Respectfully, sir, that'll never stick. It doesn't matter. Start processing. Hey. Do you want me to give you a shout if I see the detectives? Yeah. Open cell three for me. I screwed up. You think? How bad is it? It's a solid arrest. Who's Carson Holland? The car you were driving is registered to him. Is he your boyfriend? Sometimes. Okay, you have to tell them the drugs belong to him. We both know it won't matter. I was in possession. Isn't there something you can do? - What?! - They won't drop the charge. It's connected to a DEA case. This is real, Isabel. It's gonna get worse. Because tomorrow, - they're gonna have a warrant to search my apartment. What will they find? Carson stashed a kilo of heroin in my heating unit. Are you... Are you that far gone? Why would you let him do that? All right, I will not be able to plea out of this. So, i-if I go to jail, they're gonna find out I was a cop, and I'll be dead. Please, baby. Go... Go to my place. I need you. If you help me, it'll be different, all right? I'll go to rehab. - For real this time. - You're just saying that. No, no, this is different. I ca... I can be different. Please... help me. Okay? Please. 7-Adam-15 requesting an additional unit for a 51-50 hold. Hey, y'all can let him go now. Momma not pressing no more charges. - That's right. - I'm sorry, but we have no leeway here. An assault was committed. But we're not taking him to jail. A doctor will evaluate his needs. Depending on the diagnosis, he may even qualify for a facility. We can't afford that. Hey, what you doing, brah? What the hell you doing? Put that camera away, brah. No, no, no, it's okay. I'm... I'm a director. This is... This is so compelling. - Compelling? - Rupert, put the camera away. What, you think my brother's pain is entertaining? Huh? - Step back. Step back. - Put the camera away. - Step back. Hey. - You don't hear me, brah? I said put the camera away! You think I'm playing with you? Hey, guys, you do not want to escalate this. - No, no, no. - Take it back. - I'm scared. - It's okay, honey. It's okay, T. It's okay. - It's okay, honey. Don't worry. - I'm scared. Hey, it's okay, T. I'm gonna come visit you. I promise. - We're gonna take care of this. - Okay. Come on. Hey, I'm talking to my brother. I'ma come visit you, I promise. - . No. - Just wait... - I'ma come see you, T. - Wait in the car while we finish up. - You're gonna be all right. - No, I... Hey, stay strong, okay? I'ma come see you. Explain something to me, Lopez. I can see you two filed a lot of evidence reports, but I can't seem to find a single booking report. I've been instructing Officer West about how patrol can leverage lower-level criminals to get actual intel on higher-level felons, sir. Perhaps earn some goodwill prior to your Detectives exam? Officer Lopez convinced our last suspect to give up a pretty significant target. - Is that right? - Yes, sir. We have credible intel that could get us Lawrence Abuto. Major Assault Crimes would be thrilled to collar a weapons dealer like Abuto. Loop them in. - But, Lopez... - Sir? ...be careful. It's a high-reward strategy but also high-risk. There's a real possibility this won't pay off at all, and then all you did was let a bunch of little crooks get away. I was very clear, yet you brought our VIP into an incredibly volatile situation. It was unintentional. We had no idea from the call how dangerous it was gonna be. And that is the only reason that I am being pleasant right now. You're dismissed. - Crazy day, huh? - Um, did you guys get in trouble? - No. - Good. Look, I-I'm having a little thing at my place tonight, and I would love it if you'd come. I'm gonna call it a day. Thanks. She doesn't like me, does she? Oh, she's... No. Yeah. I get that a lot. Listen, I'd really like it if you came along tonight. It's my little way of saying thank you for today. I really should get home, get some rest, but... you know, someone did tell me I need to start putting myself out there more, so what the hell? Good. Good. What are you doing here? No, what are you doing here? Look, you're out of your depth on this. Look, I've been riding with you for two months. You project the rogue cop thing, but you are always on the right side of the law. If you came all the way over here to psychoanalyze me, - you wasted your time. - No, I... I came here to remind you... ...that you'll regret helping her. Because it's not gonna change her. But it'll sure as hell change you. Yeah, I'm stepping into an industry party right now. Hey, thanks, guy. Who said chivalry was dead? - Ah, hey. - Would you like an hors d'oeuvre? Uh... I-I'll pass. Thanks. - So good. - Jason! - Oh, it's, uh... - Never mind. I'm so, so glad you made it. Oh, thanks. I-I feel underdressed. I didn't realize it was a... It's Hollywood. No, no, no. Look, there's food and booze out back. Go make yourself at home. I'll be out there in a second, okay? - Hi. - Hi. Hi! Oh, look at you. I don't know if I like it. Mmm... What do you think of my new digs? Oh, this place is great. It used to belong to Marlon. - Brando? - Wayans. Oh. You sure have a lot of friends. Oh, I don't know half these people. They just wrangle invites through their publicists. Rupert. Tiffany? We met at that Golden Globes thing. Oh! Of course. Tiffany, this is, uh... this is Jim Nolan. John Nolan. Nice to meet you. LAPD. He took me on a ride along today. - Really? - Mm-hmm. That's so cool. So, what's it like being a cop? Oh, God, it's amazing. You should've seen my boy today. He stared death right in the face. Didn't even flinch. I-I flinched. It was super scary. I-I'm gonna grab a-a drink. Very nice meeting you. Can I grab a beer, please? Thank you. Hey, I saw that. Don't drink that. - He put something in your drink. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. - Get the hell off me. - I won't. I saw you. - Get off... You're under arrest. Ladies and gentlemen, John Nolan, LAPD! I'm sorry I ruined your party. Are you kidding? Everyone in town's gonna be talking about that tomorrow. Oh, and besides, I got you like a dozen phone numbers. Oh. Uh, thanks. That's, um... Oh, hey, these are cute kids. Sorry I didn't get a chance to meet 'em. - Oh, yeah. - They're in London right now. I haven't spoken to them in months. That's sad. I try to talk to my son at least once a week. Although, it's been a little longer than that this time around. Sacrifices we make for our careers, huh? God, sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. You know, these movies I make, make a fortune, but I haven't made a film anyone's cared about in years. Oh, you're kidding, right? I mean, people love your movies. The escape it brings them? Uh... Life is hard. Your movies are fun. But they're not real. Not like today was real. Look, let me tell you something. Some of my fondest memories of my son growing up are tied to your movies. Uh, he was 10 when we saw the first, and we were re-creating scenes in the backyard. I mean, it was a blast. Every summer after that, we'd go to an opening weekend and... Actually, we just talked about how we're gonna schedule the next one with him being away at college. Thank you. Yeah. Welcome. And, um, uh, thanks for the invite. J-John... What's gonna happen to the kid from today? After he gets out of hospital, will he get the care he needs? Honestly, no. They just don't have the means. Um, sadly, the system is designed to deal with crisis, not prevent it. Um... thanks. Sir, last night... Didn't happen. That clear? Hey, I got some bad news. Can't be worse than yesterday. See, I'm afraid it can. Detectives executed a search warrant on your wife's apartment this morning. They found a kilo hidden in the heating unit. She's with her lawyer now. I'm sorry, Tim. You did the right thing. Not for Isabel. So, the kilo bumps you up to a major trafficker, which means you're facing 10 to 20 now. Now, you were a decorated officer who got addicted on the job. We could try to use that. I went down the rabbit hole after I got hooked. They could've investigated me for half a dozen things. Instead, they brushed it under the rug and fired me quietly. I'm nothing but dirty laundry to them. Now they've got a clean shot, they're gonna take it. Major Crimes took a run at your intel on Lawrence Abuto. They couldn't do anything with your informant's information. Are they sure? 'Cause we had that guy wrapped up with a bow. He was lying to you, Officer Lopez. Frankly, I'm surprised you couldn't tell. Ma'am, I believed him, as well. Officer West, you're a rookie. Lopez, you're a veteran. You're usually a lot more careful than this. I'm really disappointed in you. Yes, ma'am. I heard you were the life of the party last night. Did Rupert tell you that? No, I heard it from the midnight shift. - So, was it any fun? - No. Uh, i-it was interesting. I find the whole Hollywood thing depressing. All that energy spent on stuff that just doesn't matter. Oh, hey, here's your BFF now. Oh. You can get that. - Hey. Rupert. Tell m... - Help! They're trying to kill me. - You've got to come. - Rupert? - My office. - Rupert! His office is on the studio lot. Dispatch, we have a possible 207 at Beverly Oaks Studios. John, are you still there? - Rupert? - I think I lost them. Rupert, are you okay? We're on our way. I've locked myself in the prop room. What's going on? I kept thinking about what happened yesterday, so I reached out to Tyson's brother. Look, a-at first, everything was fine, but then when I offered him money to pay for a facility, he got really angry. He started to hit me, and then his friends... - Down here! - Oh, God... - His friends... - Which way?! Come on! ...wanted me to open the safe in my office, but I managed to get away. Where'd he go? Oh, God. John, help. Help! - No, no, no, no, no! - Please. Guys, please. Please. We gotta forget about him. Yo, let's get out of here! No, not until we get all that money from that safe in his office. - I don't want his money. - Yeah? Well, we do. Back to the offi... I've lost him. His office is in that building. - Stop! Police! - Don't move! Aah! - Go get him. - On it. Cuff him and call it in! Hands behind your back. So, you want to get your cameras ready 'cause up here to my left is a sign you'll probably recognize... Malcolm, stop! Your mother's suffered enough. You're only making it worse. So what? You gonna be my savior now, too? Huh? Like Mr. Hollywood here? Offering me money to make himself feel like a hero... To put your brother in a facility. Yeah, and what happens when that runs out, huh? How we supposed to pay for your fancy-ass facility and meds? You gonna give us money for next year and the year after that? - I told you, we'll work it out. - Work it out? Like it's that simple, huh? Like my brother's just gonna be fixed now that you're here to save the day. Malcolm, he doesn't understand. - Oh, and you do? - No. God, no. I've never been in your shoes. I-I can't imagine what it's been like for you and your mom to have to care for your brother, to make sure he doesn't hurt himself, that he can never be alone. Then to have this poster child for entitlement call you up like that? - Hey. - Shh! It's gotta be infuriating. But this... ...Malcolm, this... this helps no one. This only hurts your brother, and I know you don't want to do that. So, come on. Let's... put the gun down and let's just end this, okay? I got it! I got it! - Drop the weapon! - No! - Oh! - No! Come here. Ohh... - I got shot. - Yeah. It really hurts. Don't worry, they're gonna take good care of you. ER's just five minutes away. Will you visit me in the hospital? Of course, yes. Hey, please, tell Malcolm I'm sorry. I-I-I had no idea. - He's gonna be all right? - Paramedics seem to think so. Good, then I don't have to wait to yell at you about getting your VIP shot. Well, technically, the ride along was yesterday, so... Never mind. We're transferring your wife to county. Arraignment will be tomorrow. Can I get a minute with her? I'm sorry. I needed you, and you weren't there. It wouldn't have fixed things. You don't know that! Now you never will. We're done here. Hey. Been looking for you. What's wrong? The Jason is in ICU. What, you mean the guy who likes to shock himself? The guy he flipped on found out about it. Beat him half to death with a pipe. Th-That's not on us. No, it's on me. If I hadn't been so gung ho on getting The Tap, he'd be in the house of detention, looking at a few months of jail. Now he might not be able to walk again. There's no way you could've known about that. Maybe. But I didn't even think about it, and I should have. You, um, think this will move you down the list? Are you kidding? I'm off the list. Gonna have to earn my way back onto it. Anything I can do to help... I will. You had my back when I needed it. Oh, right. I almost forgot. Did you hear about Tim's wife? What are you doing? Hanging out with you. Look, I appreciate the thought, but... - I'd rather be alone. - Too bad. I'm not gonna talk about it. You don't have to. But we're gonna be here if you change your mind. So what do we do now? Drink. - Hey. - Hey. - One of those for me? - Well, it is now. Hey, I saw the news about Rupert. - You okay? - Yeah. Days like today can be hard emotionally. I'll bet.
