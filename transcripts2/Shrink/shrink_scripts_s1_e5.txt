 _ I was so happy to hear that this slot opened up. You have no idea. I was about to spend five years in Mississippi at a different program. It was the only program that I was accepted to. But I was born at this hospital, and I... I don't know. I feel like Samba returning to, you know, the Pride Lands. Uh, Simba? Yeah. Yeah, Simba, sorry.

 It's been a long time since I saw the movie. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Uh, well, David, even on the savanna, the grass dies out occasionally, and the elephants have to find new watering holes. Mm. I-I can't continue this metaphor any more. Uh, there's been some changes since the last time that you and I talked. Okay. Uh, our surgery program has lost its funding, and we're only able to offer one residency slot. Ooh, man.

 Well, my heart goes out to all the people that are getting, uh, you know, bounced from the program. But I'm now very flattered that I'm getting that slot, and... Yeah, you're one of those people who got bounced, David. What? We're gonna have to withdrawal our offer of residency. You... No, you can't. You can't do that. I'm afraid I have to, David. No, I mean, you can't do that. I turned down the only residency program I was accepted into. I can't back on that. I was told that this slot was mine. I... I know. I know. Look, there is a slot. It was created by a wealthy donor, but he gave it to his son. What kind of hospital is this? Some rich fuck's kid gets my spot? That rich fuck is my brother. Oh, well, that clears up the math on that. Well, fuck your nephew, and your brother. - And fuck you, for that matter. - Hey, come on. There's no need for that kind of language, Mr. Tracy. No, fuck you! And it's Doctor... Dr. Tracy. Well, not here, it isn't. - Synced and corrected by medvidecek007 - - www.addic7ed.com - [DOOR SLAMS] DAVID: Pursuant to the requirements set out by Illinois Statute 225 ILCS-107, I am required to inform you that I am not a licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, or a registered therapist, but that these therapy sessions are being tape recorded to provide a record of the 1,920 supervised clinical hours needed to acquire such a license. Thanks for meeting in the car. We found a rat in the garage, just wanted to be safe. Oh, yeah, dude, no sweat. Oh, I just know it's not ideal. No, man, this is cool. I mean, I like being in cars and stuff. Okay, good. Yeah. All right. We could go to, like, Wendy's or something after. No, no, I got another session after this. Let me just get my notes. Oh, we could go during, too. I'll just get this... Oh, God damn it. You can't... - We're in a car. - Yeah, we're in a car. We're not moving. We're not driving. I have other people coming into this... Maybe the problem is that because you only have one giant fight once a year, everything gets bottled up. Yeah, that is the problem, and it's also the point. Otherwise, we would be fighting every single day. This way, we knock it all out, and we move on with our lives. - Is it that bad? - Yeah. I am a beast. She's exaggerating. It's not that bad. Oh, no. I can feel it coming. DAVID: How's it going with your mom? I told her I'm not gonna talk to her anymore. She keeps acting with her bullshit. We talked about using harsh language with her. Did you say the word "bitch"? Well, ever since I was 4, she's been a big, old, fat bitch. JANINE: I am not a nice person to you, and you know it! You are a nice person to me. We're in love. I'm an insane bitch to you, and you look at me, and you smile, and then you do things like bring me flowers, and it fucks me up. You deserve flowers. What the fuck?! - I'll tell you the fuck. - What? - I love you. - Oh! We're supposed to be together. You're really not appreciating the value of words. Okay, please, don't. We're in a car. You need to... The car is the safest part for a fire. No, it's not. The rubber... You can't burn rubber. Yes, you can. The expression "Burn rubber" exists because you burn rubber. You're thinking about lightning. Okay, cars can catch fire at any time. No, lightning starts fire, and then fire... - to avoid that, you go into a car. - A lot of things... - Dude, are you gonna hit me, dude?! - No! I will never... ever... fucking marry you. I don't believe that. He is fucking obsessed with getting married. I like planning weddings! It's fun for me! It's relaxing! Why would we want to do that? - I don't want to wear a dress. - That's cool. I do not want to waltz. I don't want a cake. That's not fair. Do not cry. You do have a problem. You swear a lot. You need to scale that back. I fucking hate you, dude. [VOICE BREAKING] Why are you doing this?! When you cry, it is just grating. You're just trying to be so cool in front of David. - You're trying to be so cool. - Now he's gonna cry. [CRYING] I don't understand what we're doing here! - I told you not to cry. - This is fucking stupid! - Don't cry! - No one's crying! I'm not crying! Yes, you are. He's crying. You can even hear that he runs like an asshole. You're my best friend. I love you. Thank you for this. Okay, it's our third session. Let's... pace ourselves. Okay, it's going good. Yeah. [HUMMING] David, have you been smoking marijuana? No, Mom, one of my patients just smoked in my car. Well, I hope you didn't participate in that. No. Weed makes me crazy and anxious. I mean, I assume it would. You do seem a little anxious. [SCOFFS] Yeah, I guess I am, all right? I've got a patient coming in, like, five minutes. I'm doing free therapy outside of a tented-off garage in a car that reeks like marijuana, which is extremely unprofessional. I can't get this water bottle to work because... I can't get anything to work, because apparently, I suck at everything I do. Let me help. [WATER RUNNING] [SIGHS] - There you go. - Thanks. I'm sorry. I'm such a mess right now. I've got that stupid med-school get-together coming up. It's stressing me out. And... I think I'm really, really high. You are. - You can tell? - Oh, my God, yes. Of course. No. I've got five minutes. Your eyes look like little pin holes. So this is great. You dealt with your lunch and your breakfast threats. You know. - Yeah. - You're really keeping those down. Under-milking my cereal so it doesn't have that looseness to it. And I found soy. I found a place that has cheap soy milk... a place called Happy Foods by me, so... Oh, you shop at Happy Food? Oh, it's awesome. Awesome. You know it? Uh, I've driven by, yeah. Oh, well, stop the car and come on in, 'cause it's great. Oh, you go frequently? Oh, yeah, it's my regular stop, yeah. Between what hours to you go? Uh, well, usually, I'm buying right before dinner, so I would say... 4:30 to 6:30. - I'm trying to stay on that schedule. - Oh, that's good. So, somewhere in that neighborhood. Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, well, good to know. - All right, I'll make a note of that. - All right. Hey, can we talk for a sec? - We can talk for six minutes. - Okay. [CHUCKLES] Uh, but about us? Um, I think we have done some awesome stuff, and... and progress went so quickly that I think I'm good. What? I think you fixed me. No, no, no, no, no. That's a common misconception. You can think that you're fixed, and everything's fine... I'm not thinking that, I know. I'm good now. No, no. Yeah, all right, you can think that you're better, and you can leave, but you're not better, and you can't leave. David, you fixed me. - It's not that simple. - It's over. Thank you. David, sometimes patients just leave whether they're ready or not. You shouldn't take it so personally. But he was my favorite. And you shouldn't be ranking your patients. Well, how do you avoid that? You're obviously attached to me. We have a professional relationship. Come on. You can be honest. I tell great stories. I make you laugh. I'm one of your favorites. David, I don't have favorites. You have to have patients that you don't like, you know? I mean, there are those at the bottom, and then it kind of goes up from there. Patients that you kind of like, patients you like, and then I'm at the top... Your favorite. Man, you don't give up anything. Hey. Hey. Your mom asked me to come out here and talk to you for a few minutes. Oh. Well, thanks, Rollie. Yep. Well... Is there anything you want to talk about? [CHUCKLES] Like, just off the top of my head? Sure. Yeah, whatever's on your mind. You know, if you got some Armor All and a paper towel, you'd get all that dust off the dashboard there. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's good to know, Rollie. So, what's the deal? They didn't take the trash? What, was Monday a holiday? Uh, yeah, I think Columbus Day. Ah, Columbus Day. Yeah, we're celebrating him. He was a real son of a bitch. - Yeah. - We got a holiday for him. Not a good guy. No, he was... used to cut off people's hands if they didn't find him gold. - Yeah? - Yeah. I knew he was bad, I didn't know he was a hand-cutter. Yeah. Yeah. So strange. Well, you get a Monday off, so... I'm gonna go back inside now. All right, yeah. - All right, thanks. - Yeah, hey, thank you. Shit. [SIGHS] [MUMBLING] Mom said I have to come out here and apologize for the other day. What? [SIGHS] Mom told me I have to come out here and apologize to you for the other day. Wow, that seems really heartfelt. Thanks, Barry. Do you have Spotify? Yeah. Okay, well... I made you a playlist. Oh, that's really nice. Thanks, man. I appreciate it. Relax, gay-wad. I just Googled songs with the word "Doctor" in the title. Also, "Paradise City" is on there. That's okay. That's a good song. "Hot for Teacher" is on there, too. [CHUCKLES] Nice. Hey, what about "Doctor, Doctor"? What the hell is that? It's got "Doctor" twice in the title. If you Googled songs with "Doctor" in it, it would have come up. Are you... saying I lied about how I found these songs? No, I don't care how you found the songs. It'd be a silly lie. I agree. All right. Well, I'm gonna bail before one of your freaks show up. They're not freaks, man. They're ugly on the outside and the inside. Are you describing them... Or... you? [DOOR OPENS] Mom, I have like 10 minutes until my next session. I get what you're doing. I'm fine. I want to talk. Okay. [SIGHS] I thought my life was over when your father died. Oh, I was so scared. I thought I had my whole life all planned out. And then, suddenly, I was alone with this little boy, and I didn't know anything about boys and trucks - and wrestling and wet dreams and... - I didn't have any... David, this is my session. Let me talk. [SNIFFLES] I thought... that I was doing everything wrong. Everything. I mean, I... There were so many nights when I would go to sleep just sure that I had failed. But then, you know, I watch you... Doing this and trying to help people, and I know I didn't fail. I reminds me so much of your father. He was a try-er, too. I guess the point is everybody feels like a failure sometimes. We all do. But if you thought you were nailing everything, you wouldn't try. And... It's the trying that... Makes you better. [SNIFFLES] I think it made me better. And I think it made you better. Thanks, M... Thanks, Mom. You know, I can't get my seat up, honey. - It's the lever on the right. - I've got the lever. I'm doing it. It just won't move me any. It's just not going. Just pull it. Lean up and pull. I'm leaning up, and I'm pulling. Okay, well, let me get it. - No, I've got it. I just... - Well, hold still, Mom. No, stop the momentum. - No, it's... - Ow! Aah! There. - Damn it. - That did it. That's a good talk. Oh, here. Stop. Just let me, okay? I'm gonna unlock it. No, we do it on three. One, two, three. [CLICK] No. Just take your hand away from the door. Just one, two... Just do what I say for once. - One, two, three. - [CLICK] You went way in front of go. Oh, yeah, and I'm saving - a fortune on cranberry sauce. - Cranberry sauce? The loose foundation of the purge meal. Oh, yes. Yes. You can't build the purge meal on a solid, you got to have something loose at the bottom - so that the rocket... - Yeah. Great, yeah. Yourg. He still needs me. [SIGHS] Hey. I have to go save a patient. At 2:30 in the morning? Shit. Right. Mm. Okay, I'll do it tomorrow. Damn it. JULIA: You dropped something. Not you, dumb-dumb, Dougie. Slower. Attaboy. It's going really great with Julia. Oh, I really don't want to hear about it. She is the light of my world. You see how I'm saying I don't want to hear about it? She's the candle at the end of the road. - What? - She's a bottle of vinegar that you didn't know that you needed, but now you look in the cellar, and you're like, "Yeah, I'm glad I have that because"... You're just looking at the shelves now. You're looking at the vinegar on the shelf. But she's also, you know, olive oil, because she's super... Those are right there. You got me there. What if you find out a patient has relapsed? Can you reach out to them and get them back? Absolutely not. If a patient chooses to leave you, that's their decision. Okay, I definitely won't do that. David, you seem a little tense today. [SIGHS] Yeah, I am. I agreed to go to this happy-hour thing with some people I went to med school with, and I'm dreading it. Why? Sounds like it might be fun. My ex-girlfriend Amanda might be there. Mm, I see. And I just have a fair amount of shame related to all medical-school stuff, 'cause I feel like I'm gonna look like a failure in their eyes, you know? They all came from wealthy families or families of doctors, and I didn't. But I was this close to... to being in there, and I'm not complaining, I'm not whining. I was afforded a great opportunity. And, yes, I'm half a million dollars in debt, and, yes, my dream turned into a nightmare, and I got fucked pretty hard. But, still, I'm grateful. It's just now they're all doing their fancy residencies, and I'm doing laps around my neighborhood trying to pot smoke out of my car. Excuse me? Oh, nothing. It's a... Metaphor. Anyway, it's supposed to be a happy hour, it's gonna be more of a suck-ass hour. I think it would be less popular if they called it that. Hey, that was a joke! Whoa! I've never seen that before. [CHUCKLES] See, I'm one of your favorites. Oh, it's just a joke, David. I'm on top. Mm. No. All right, I'm just gonna go. - Bye, David. - Bye. Have a good week. ♪  WOMAN: David! Amanda, fuck. - Hey! - Oh! Kim! Oh, thank God. I thought you were Amanda for a second. Oh, God, no. She's on overnights at the hospital. - She's not coming tonight. - [SIGHS] - It's good to see you. - You, too. - You look good. - Yeah? No, you look terrible. Oh, yeah, you look terrible, too. - Yeah. All right, let's get drunk. - Yeah? That was bullshit, what happened to you, David. I mean, losing the residency to that guy's douchebag nephew. Yeah, man, it should have been you. - I can't believe that happened. - Thank you, man. What are you doing now, anyway? Well, um... I'm gonna take a year off, you know, to re-access things, but my parents also need help right now, so... Hmm. Well, I think that's great. I mean, honestly, this whole residency bullshit is exhausting. Yeah. I was at the ICU for 18 hours the other day. I could barely see straight. I can barely see straight. We should do some shots. [LAUGHTER] Came to that quickly. I like your thinking. Okay, it's my turn. I'm gonna order them. Someone get them, okay? I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back. David, really glad you came out. It's good to see you, man. Oh, it's good to see you, too. I didn't want to come out tonight, so I was kind of worried about it. Yeah, we do this. - Yeah, dude, that's epic. - Yeah. No, man. Never. - Uh, hold on a second. - [CELLPHONE BUZZES] Hey, Kim. Look towards the bathroom. Uh, Kim needs help with the shots. Are you doing free therapy? I can explain it. Okay, it's only temporary so I can defer my loans and keep my medical license. Where are you doing this? My parents' garage. Well, technically, my car right now. We found some dead rats, and... it's a long story. Just don't tell any of the guys, all right? David, if they think it's stupid, then they're assholes, okay? I think it's awesome. Thanks, Kim. I appreciate it. Oh, buddy. I'm gonna go to the bathroom, 'cause my bladder really filled up with panic, so... Okay. All right, this one's on me. Nice. All right, let's make a toast. To Dr. David Tracy. Oh, thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. And all the free therapy in his parents' garage! - [LAUGHTER] - What the fuck?! Are Wednesdays at 4:00 open, because I want to talk about how hard it is - to be a real doctor! - [LAUGHTER] Yeah, yeah, can I come in right afterwards to talk about the exact same thing, 'cause I'm also a real doctor? - [LAUGHTER] - Don't laugh at that. He's just repeating what he said. Oh, yeah? How does that make you feel? ALL: Ooh! Yeah, dude. How did that make you feel? - Stop fucking repeating things! - Stop fucking repeating things! Shut up! None of it is funny. I'm working just as hard as you, and I'm trying to help people. It's the same fucking thing! And if we're burning people, Pat, you went into podiatry 'cause you have a foot fetish. That's not true. I just want to help people's feet. Bullshit! How many times has he gotten drunk and Googled "foot pussy" in front of us, a million? [LAUGHTER] Oh, snap! Sick burn! Dude, David wins that one. Got to give it up to my dog. Come on. No. No, man. Fuck this. How's that make you feel? Especially you, Brian, you sick piece of shit. I can't believe you have the balls to show up here. You all should be ashamed for bringing Brian here. You know what he did. You don't want to talk about it. None of us are gonna talk about it, all right? Why was he invited? Why the fuck was Brian invited, huh? Look down. Keep looking down, Brian! [SIGHS] Thanks for coming on such short notice. - Yeah, yeah, what's up? - I appreciate it. - Sure. - So... Listen, I have a friend who works at Happy Foods... who told me that someone came into the store recently and bought up all the cranberry sauce. Okay. We're close to Thanksgiving. It's October, Yourg. Oh. I'll have to get mine somewhere else. - [CHUCKLES] - Right, 'cause you shop there. Used to, yeah, yeah, but I mean, if I'm... You shop there. - Sure, sometimes, yeah. - So, one person went in and bought out all the cranberry sauce. Come on. I don't know what you... What do you want? Your friend said somebody bought all the shit. - I don't know. - I'm the friend, okay? I work at Happy Foods. Why are you working at Happy Foods? 'Cause I'm half a million dollars in debt, all right? I have to make money somehow. I have a part-time job stocking shelves at Happy Foods. I know what happened. I don't understand what you want. I want you to level with me. I'm... I've been having a hard time. I'm not doing good. You just got so invested in my progress, that I didn't want to tell you. You're supposed to be able to tell me anything. You want me to tell you I brought all the cranberry sauce? All right, I bought all the cranberry sauce from Happy Foods. - Okay? - Are you cool? - Yeah. - Cool, are we done? No, we're not done. I can't handle being responsible for your sense of well-being. I can't. I can't. The better I do, the better you feel. I can't take that kind of pressure. I can't be your best patient anymore, all right? 'Cause your favorite just fucked up and shit the bed on eating. I'm not trying to put more pressure on you. Well, you did, all right, whether you wanted to or not. Well, okay. You know, we can work on that. I'll be a better listener. I won't tell you that you're my favorite patient. In fact, you're my worst patient. - I don't even like you. - Yes, you do. - Oh, sorry, okay. I didn't mean that. - I know. My point is you can't leave things like this, all right? You can beat this if you have help. I have help. - Are you seeing someone else? - Eh. It really doesn't matter. - How long? - It doesn't matter. - It does matter to me. - David, it doesn't. I should just go. [SCOFFS] Yeah, fine, go. [CLICK] - What's stopping you? - You locked the door. [CLICK] [SIGHS] [BICYCLE BELL RINGS] Hey. Uh, sorry, I thought I left you a voicemail canceling our session. Yeah, I know. Um, you sounded kind of mopey. Oh. What's going on? I've just had a real shitty few days. Uh, I got broken up with twice... - Professionally. - Oh. [CHUCKLES] I just didn't think I'd be good at therapy today. Do you have a bike? Okay, lift! Oh! Oh! Oh! [LAUGHS] Jesus! [COUGHING] Okay. Yeah. There is definitely a rat problem in there. - You okay? - Yeah. - Here. - Is this safe to wear? Yeah, it's fine. It's just rat poison. - Where are we going? - Uh... It's a surprise. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. You okay on that thing? Yeah, yeah. I've been on a bike before. - You have? - I'm just stiff from my car. Oh, cars turn you on, huh? No, cars... That's not what gets me stiff. - Boom, boom. - Okay. - You see this city block over here? - Yeah. The whole thing's owned by the band Styx. Yeah, after their first platinum album, - they just bought a whole city block. - Really? And they party in every house. [LAUGHS] Where are we going? I wanted to take to you the place where I had my first kill. Oh. Am I next? No, I don't really have a lust for blood tonight, but I could make an exception for a mercy kill. Oh. Honestly, I'd really like that. I feel like I deserve one. [LAUGHS] Off-road! Whoa, wait! Cool. This is really tough off-roading, by the way. Yeah, yeah, I know. It's really intense. I do BMX a lot. - You do? - Yeah. Wow, I thought that disappeared in the '90s. Yeah, it did, yeah. - Very retro. - [LAUGHS] Um... [CHUCKLES] Are you hungry? Sure. I could always eat. People don't like to hear it, but it's hard for me to put on weight. - I don't like hearing that. - Well... - [LAUGHS] - All right. - But... - But thank you for sharing. Yeah, I mean, I... I have little stick legs. - Aww. - And... I have a plump little butt on the back of it. [LAUGHS] You do? - I do, yeah, I have a little shelf. - Prove it. - Prove it? - Yeah. - You want to see my butt right now? - Yeah. All right, hold on. Let me put the kickstand down. You really feel comfortable showing me your butt right now? Yeah, I'll show you my butt. Hold on. [LAUGHING] You won't. I will. No! Okay, okay! - Okay! - You don't want to see my butt? - I... no, I... - Look at my butt. - I do! Don't! - It's a nice butt. I'm sure it is. Just the top half. Look at the top half. Look! Okay, I saw it! I saw it! Psych. It was the whole butt. Yeah, I saw. Hold on. Let me tuck back in. I can't believe you showed me your butt. Oh, shit. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Um... you want to get some food? I would love to get some food. ♪  ♪  ♪  ♪  ♪  That's not the point. If you call your mom a big, old, fat bitch, she's gonna be upset. She's gonna take that out... - Do not... - Oh, shit.
