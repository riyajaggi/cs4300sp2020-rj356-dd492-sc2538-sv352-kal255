 So, what did you think my problems were when I first came to see you? Well, I definitely thought you were a hoarder. - A hoarder?! - Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean... I mean, look at the mess over there. Look at all those sweaters. They're neatly folded. There's way too many of them. Who are you, Mrs. Rogers? [LAUGHS] Well, Mr. Rogers was a bachelor, I think.

 Okay, fine. Then... then Miss Rogers. [LAUGHS] Well, I'd love to analyze your apartment, but you live with your parents. God-damn, that's cold. I'm sorry. Well, this is the best session I've ever had. [LAUGHS] Oh, right. What are you doing? [LAUGHS] [CLEARS THROAT] "Pursuant to the requirements set out by Illinois Statute 225 ILCS-107,

 I am required to inform you that I am not a licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, or registered therapist." Stop. I have to read this. "But that these therapy sessions are being tape-recorded to provide a record... " I'm trying to be a professional here. "... of the 1,920 supervised clinical hours needed to... " Okay. [BOTH LAUGH] [PAPER RUSTLING] Now don't rip it, Rollie! I wanted to save it. - Oh! - Oh, my gosh! It's the painting we painted on our first date. - Best first date idea ever. - Oh. - We painted this ourselves. - And we signed it. And signed it. Oh, where did you find it, sweetie? It was under a bunch of old posters in the garage. Oh, my gosh. And look at that frame. It's so nice. Well, it's no terrifying clown painting, but I thought maybe you could still put it up on the wall. - [GASPS] That's great. - Memory. That's a great place for it. And now we have a memory of the memory. Oh, sweetie, it's okay. - You're all right. - You've done good, son. Aw. Thanks, Rollie. - Thank you. - Yeah. I'll put it right here. Yeah, go ahead. You've touched his emotional underbelly. - Well, I'll get out of here so you can tuck it back in. - [GASPS] No, you! [LAUGHS] Hey! I can't believe it. You give them some garbage you found in the garage, and they fucking love it. What are you making, a protein shake here, huh? Gonna beef up? Got to be honest, feels pretty good. I don't know if you need it. Hey. It's not just your outer strength. It's your inner strength that inspires all of us. I love you. I love you, too, man. Have a good day. Oh, somebody's got their tight pants on. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Yo? I saw you eating Pringles, so I docked you $3.50. Oh. You know what? I had a Lunchables, too. Keep the change. I love working here. Is that gold eye shadow? - Yes, it is. - It's subtle, but it's a sophisticated daytime look. Sorry. Caught my eye, so I had to say something. Hope the rest of your day is fantastic. Are you still mad? I wasn't mad, David. I was reinforcing my point. I have a cake pop with your name on it. Would that make you any less not mad? Thank you. Why don't we just talk about your week? Honestly, I'm wracking my brain, and I can't think of a single complaint. It's been a great week. That's good to hear. Sounds like you're making very good progress. Also, I met somebody, and she's really great. I mean, I know I have a history of moving way too fast with these things and jumping ahead of myself, but I'm not going to do that this time. I'm just going to take it as it happens and not put any pressure on the situation whatsoever. That sounds like a very good idea. Now, all that being said, I'm pretty sure I have a girlfriend. [RINGTONE PLAYS] I'm sorry. Yeah, I definitely have a girlfriend. ♪ I adopted an elderly dog with three legs. He's got diabetes. See, this is part of the pattern. Oh. You're right. Thank you. Yeah. I like the pants, I like the shirt, I like the shoes. - Thank you. - This feels so good. Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you for moving the lamp. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. This has been the most fun 90 minutes, dude. No, it's been 22 minutes. What? What brings you in to therapy? Um, I guess... for lack of a better term, performance anxiety. - Are you... - Hmm? Hmm? I'm sorry. I'm... So I have a hard time in front of... in front of people, but only now, I didn't used to when I had the 7:00 mass. Small group, nice people. But then I got promoted to the 10:00 A.M. Oh. What does that mean? It's the 10:00 A.M. mass. It's the big leagues. And it's packed. Okay, I see how that would be a little bit more pressure. I'm really good in... in a small group, one-on-one, confession. I can crush a Bible study. Ask anyone. Well, you know, a technique that I like to use when I'm feeling anxiety is to articulate what the worst-case scenario would be within a given situation. So let's say, in this situation in a large group, maybe you forget a little bit of your sermon, what's the worst that could happen? - The worst that could happen? - Yeah. The congregation loses faith in their pastor. The collection basket's empty. Right? The Lord himself places me among the "eternally unredeemable." I don't think the Lord would do that. Do you talk to God as much as I do? Oh, yeah. All the time. I mean, last night, I was practically screaming his name over and over again. [CHUCKLES] That's inappropriate. Yes, it is. - I apologize. - I'll let it go. Thank you. You know, maybe I can come on Sunday? Maybe it would be helpful if I was, you know, in... in the congregation listening to you perform? I'm afraid that might contribute to my nervousness. Oh, right, yeah. - Knowing that you're there. - Right. Well, then, in that case, I won't be there. Oh. I... I'm having a hard time believing you. I just remembered that I have plans, and I definitely won't be there. You know, it's not dark. I'll be able to see if you're there. No, no, I plan on not being there. But if you're there, I will see you, regardless of your plans. You understand that, right? You won't see me. I won't be there. Well, if you're not there, I won't see you. Right. When's your next service? Sunday. Oh. Right. Yeah. Of course. Of course it is. Sounds like a cool restaurant, so I untucked my shirt. - Yeah, you look like Aaron Carter got mugged. - Yeah. It's the kind of restaurant, though, where the waiters make fun of you. Laura loves it. She goes every year on her birthday. - Cool. - So you have to act like - you're having a good time. - Dr. Tracy? Dr. David Tracy? - Yes. - Me Trevor. Yeah. Trevor. You remember me? - Um, yes, Trevor. - Trevor. Hi. I tried to get ahold of you several times, as myself, and sometimes as other people, even. - Yes, I remember you. - I drive a Trans Am. I've been to Tokyo. I was wondering if we could connect... we could make a connection? Yeah, I... I... I remember you. I referred you to another therapist. Did you contact her? I tried to contact her, and then what happened is, I didn't contact her. Well, look, I... I'm afraid I can't... Can be have an impromptu "session" right now? David, we have that dinner reservation that we should make. - We're... we're running late. - Reservations? We all have reservations. Reservations, reservations. - [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] - Hold on a second. Before we continue... There we go. How about I call you tomorrow and we can talk about you seeing the other therapist? Okay. That sounds fine. - Okay. Thank you. - If you were a sparrow, I'd wish that sparrow a good day. - I'm a sparrow then. - [LAUGHS] [GUNSHOT] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Call 911! Okay, call 911. Stay awake, stay awake. Stay with me, stay with me, Stay awake, stay awake. A man just shot himself in the head. Stay awake, stay awake. 5-3-4-3... Stay awake, stay awake. Stay with me, okay, stay awake. Stay awake, stay awake. The ambulance is... they're two... - two minutes away. - Okay, when they get here, talk to them. Tell them it was a minute-and-a-half ago, two minutes ago, okay? Rachel, Rachel, look at me. It's okay. Don't look down, don't look down, it's okay. [SIREN WAILS] This is Trevor. Trevor's a 53-year-old male. Self-gunshot wound to the mouth. Was he stabilized immediately on the scene? I turned him, I cleared his airway. It happened about 25, 26 minutes ago. Right there, pressure right there. Less pressure. There's still 122 diaphoretic. Completely GCS 10. Pupils are equal, not reactive... [BEEPING] David, we came as soon as we could. Oh, my God. Are you okay? What are you doing here? Well, Cindy was in her backyard, and she said there was a gunshot in the alley and that you got into an ambulance. - Are you okay? - Dude, what happened to you? Oh, my God, your shirt is full of blood! - Mom, I'm fine. - I will never be able to get that out, but they have the exact same shirt at Kohl's. - Let me just check the size. - It's... it's fine, Mom. - David, I... I got shirts, man. - We need a new shirt. Mom, stop talking about the shirt. - Just relax, Renetta. - Okay. David, we're just happy that you're fine. - Yes. - But seriously, if you want us to pick something up at Kohl's, it's open for, what, another 39 minutes. Yes, we can be there and back in no time. There's one near here. - We won't go to the one at home... - There's actually two Kohl's in this area. Please, stop talking about Kohl's! Stop talking about Kohl's! One of my patients shot himself in the head in front of me. Oh, dear Christ. What?! David, you do not know what you're doing, all right? - Take a walk, Barry! - You cannot... David. Sweetie? What do you what us to do? Thank you for checking on me, okay, but there's nothing to do, all right? I just have to wait alone, okay? - All right, we hear you. - Okay. Of course. [SNIFFLES] Of course. Guys, come on, go. - You're all right? Okay. - Yeah, yeah, it's fine. All right. I have to stay here. I have to... there's nothing to do - but stay here and wait alone, all right? - We'll be at home. We'll be at home waiting for you. - Thank you. - We'll come back. Hey. Hey. So the cops are here. They're going to want you to make a statement. Oh. Yeah. Of course. I got this shirt at Kohl's. Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I love you. What? [LAUGHS] Oh, nothing. I'm reading the balloons. Oh. Well, in that case, congratulations. It's a boy. What? You're pregnant? - How? - No, let's go sit down. I was in a condom the whole time. I know you were. I remember. Okay. ♪ Hey. Sorry. Hey, it's okay. Hey. You keep falling asleep. - Why don't you get home? - No, I'll stay here. No, get some real sleep at home, okay? Okay. Bye. [COINS JINGLING] [BEEPING] No! No! No! [SIGHS] "Cool Ranch." Fuck! [WHIMPERS] No. David? Amanda. What happened? Are you okay? I'm fine. I just got these Cool Ranch, but I wanted the Bugles. No, David, your clothes. [GROANS] I'm the one who brought in the guy with the self-inflicted gunshot wound. - Oh, wow. - It went in through the posterior oropharynx, but it looks like it exited near the temporal bone, so... Missed the occipital lobe and brain stem. - Yeah. - Yeah. You look great. Oh, thanks. [CHUCKLES] You look... well, you look like shit. [BOTH LAUGH] It was really good to see you. Yeah, good to see you, too. David Tracy? Yeah? The patient's out of surgery. He is in stable condition. We minimized the swelling in the brain and we were able to stop all of the bleeding. - What did he look like? - He had a little beard. So what if Amanda's dating a guy with a beard? "Little beard," Kendra. Maybe you could help if you had a little beard. [ECHOING] Little beard. Little beard. It's a little beard. Hello, "Little Beard." Excuse me? Is that a little beard? Uh, it's a beard. Size is relative, I suppose. Sorry, I didn't introduce myself. I'm Dr. Gil Reaves. Whoo-hoo. I think David might be in a slight state of shock. Oh, I'm shocked. Shocked at how little that beard is. - What? - What? This is a goatee. [CHUCKLES] Okay, guy. - It's Gil. - I'm thrilled. - David Tracy? - Yeah? Our administrator would like to speak with you - when you have a moment? - Okay. Sure. Right on time. What was that all about? I have no idea. Well, I have to say, Dr. Tracy, I've been looking over the intake notes on your patient, 10-out-of-10 residents would've laid him on his back to immobilize him, but you had the foresight to realize that would've resulted in the patient suffocating. You may have saved that man's life. What's his status? You tell me. Where would you have taken things from there? Um... You put him in an isolated trauma bay and go through all the standard procedure, and then if he's still critical after that, I would put him in a medically-induced coma and hope for the best. That's exactly what we're doing. You know, the last time you were in my office, we had a fairly, uh... [CHUCKLES] contentious meeting. There was all that business with my nephew and... [CHUCKLES] Yeah, I'm sorry. - I overreacted. - It was passionate, and we need more passionate doctors. Great. Too bad things didn't work out. Well, that's why I'd like to talk to you today. How would you feel about an observership? You wouldn't have patients of your own, but you'd be working alongside residents as they do their daily routine. Six-to-eight months, I'd check in with them, get some feedback on how you're performing, and if you're doing well, we'll see about getting you back in that residency program. - Wait. Really? - Absolutely. You don't have to decide today. Take your time, think it over. - Yeah. I will. - But good work, Dr. Tracy. Thank you. Oh. Hey! Hey, Gil told me what you did back there. God, you saved that man's life. Oh. That's great. You and Gil are great together. Uh, Gil and I are not together. You're not? No. Well, awesome. Uh... I know you got to get back to work, so... take care. David, I got your letter. Yeah. You weren't supposed to read that. Then why did you mail it? I didn't understand the exercise. I... never mind. I'm sorry. Yeah, it... It kind of pissed me off. I wish you would've just said those things while we were dating. We could've worked them out. - We could have? - I don't know, maybe. It's just that every time we had a problem, you said everything was okay, and that's not how you deal with problems, it's stubborn. Well, believe me, I'm not that guy anymore. All I do all day is deal with problems. Can we just talk again? Can I call you? Meet you for a coffee? Um... Yeah. Okay. Yeah? - No. - No? Not no. I don't know. Is that okay? Yeah, of course. That's fine. Ah, sorry, I got some blood... - Oh, I... I got it. - Sorry. No, it's okay. All right. Do you have a minute? I do now. [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] Saw this coming. How are you feeling about all this? I feel crazy. I feel like somehow this is my fault. But I only saw him one time. I referred him to you, but I didn't follow up to see if he followed up. There wasn't enough following up. I... I should have followed up. It's okay, David. Yeah, but then I saw Amanda at the hospital, and she looks great, and turns out, she's not dating Little Beard. But she read my letter, and she called me stubborn. But now she wants to get coffee and... It's just so confusing, because I thought I was over her. But, you know, I'm seeing this amazing girl who's totally different. And then Little Beard's uncle offered me a spot at the hospital, so now everything's up in the air. And I can't stop blaming myself for all of it. I mean, a guy shot himself in the head outside my garage. - I should've been paying more attention. - David. I'm so sorry this happened to you. You referred him to a more experienced therapist. It was his choice not to call me, and even if he had, you might be the only therapist who could've saved his life because of your medical training. You did everything right. [SOBS] I'm sorry. I'm a really ugly crier. It's okay, David. You'll feel better if you just admit it, go ahead. It's pretty bad. [BOTH LAUGH] [LAUGHTER CONTINUES] Well... in light of everything that's happened, I think it would be good for you to continue your hours in an office setting. You know, we have some available space down the hall. I only use it a couple of times a week for a peer support group therapist. I think it'd be good if you used that room for your sessions. Really? Yes. And I think it'd be nice to have you closer by. I mean, in case you need to refer somebody or if you need anything at all, I'm right down the hall. Just take some time and think about that. Thank you for everything. Thank you, David. ♪ Hey! You need help? Fuck you! - Synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com -
