I'm starting to think, maybe that wasn't such a good call. But it's been repaired and all is forgiven ish. See, that doesn't help. Maybe you'd be less nervous if you came out with me this morning.

Long story. I had to share a cab. Don't tell me with that girl who was flirting with you. The was with a guy. - Mick. - Mick? Mick. He's a security guard at my place of business. And he was absolutely hammered. - I would not let him drive. - So I guess i'll pay the cab. Thank you, Dick. Anyways, Mick, he threw up on me in the cab. I know, yuck. So I had to go to his place, take a shower. And, what, he had nothing for you to wear? Nothing my size. He's a dwarf. Your security guard's a dwarf? I would not mess with him though, he's vicious. A vicious dwarf vomited on Sam, Dick. Yeah, right. Would anyone mind if I made a quick jaunt to the restroom? Sure. Yeah, the powder room is to the right. Okie-dokey. - Not again. - Sorry. No, Sam, it's not your fault. - The power goes out all the time. - Hasn't been the same since the flood. I some experience with electricity stuff. - I got it. - Okay. Sam! I thought it was the powder room. I thought it was the powder room. - I thought it was the powder room. - You urinated on my goose. - We can wash it off. - You urinated on my goose! - It's a five-second rule. - You're spilling! Sam, Sam. Sam, my goose. - I'm so sorry, Angela. - Angela. Something's wrong with that trip switch. Dick, be careful. Sam's urine. Dad! Dick? Hey, baby. I came up with a plan. So today, first of all, I'm gonna be on my best behavior. I'm gonna be pulling out chairs for your mom, opening doors. And then tonight at dinner, we'll tell them. - Think you'll be on time for dinner? - And I deserve that. Mel, - I've apologized a lot. - I know. And I just. I'm very sensitive right now. So I just need to know that you're okay. Look, I've lived here my whole life, and I still get lost in this house. I'm always peeing in places that aren't bathrooms. - Once I pooped in the laundry room. - I'm gonna punch you in the face. I was joking about the punching in the face. - Well, that's very funny. - In context, if you would have seen. Explain to me the context in which punching my daughter in the face is funny. Dad, how are you? He has a concussion. The hospital wanted to keep him another night, but your father is so stubborn. Darling, I'm fine. And I haven't missed the annual bar council luncheon in 30 years, and I'm not missing this one. I'm just gonna rinse the urine outta my hair and I'll be off. That makes me nervous, him out and about after such a big fall. He is a stubborn old coot. That reminds me. Come. Well. Okay, you too, Sam. Good god. It's his birthday present. Do you love it? It's by the same man who does all the portraits of the presidents. He's been working on it for over a year. And he said it's his masterpiece. - Dad looks very stern. - Yeah, I know. Which he can be. But you see that little gleam in his eye? Your father's playful too. And that's what a good portrait does. It gives the whole sense of a person. When you move, his eyes go with you. It's creep. It's a beautiful picture of him. - Nice and easy, judge clayton. - I just was dizzy. If I could just lie down for a second, I think I'll be fine. - Take him in the back. - Thank you. Yes. This will be fine. Yes, thank you. Hello? Mel? Angela? Er, Mrs. Clayton? The phone is ringing quite a bit. Hello, Clayton residence. Hello, this is hewitt's, the undertakers. Is Mrs. Clayton in? She is not. Maybe I can. What can I do you for? We've got judge Clayton down here. I'm afraid he collapsed in the street. I don't know. No, he's fine. I just saw him a half hour ago. Yes, well, - we put him in the back room. - My god. Hopefully, you can get down here as soon as possible. And I guess he was too lazy. Sam. - Is everything all right? - That was hewitt's on the phone. The undertaker? They've got Dick. He collapsed in the street. I don't understand. Dick's dead. Thank you, Martin. I'm feeling much better. Hate to rush, but I don't want to Miss my train. Judge Clayton, someone's coming to get you. I'm so sorry, Mel. We never even got to tell him about the baby. I know. If it's a boy, I wanna name him Dick. Okay. Yeah, that's definitely something we can. We can talk about. I was thinking maybe we should tell her about the baby. - That be some good news, right? - Stupid Sam and his stupid urine all over the floor! You killed him! You killed Dick! - Or maybe we'll wait. - Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna go to the undertakers. I'm gonna take care of all the paperwork. - Thank you. - Okay. Have you ever identified a body before? It can be pretty unsettling. No, I think I'm just supposed to sign something. Body has to be ID. Are you squeamish around dead bodies? Well, here's a secret. I am too. "So why'd you take this job?" You ask. - I didn't ask. - I don't know. I was just hanging out with my cousin who's studying to be a chef. Now that seems like a fun job, right? All those good smells in the kitchen. Delicious. So is this him? Yep. Nope. Really? All right, well, guess we'll have to look at this one too. It's gotta bthis one here, hold on. God! Sometimes you see things like that. I'm really sorry. That's not him either. Come on, man. I'm gonna have to answer that phone real quick. I'll be right back, okay? I think that might be him. Hey, man, so is that him? Yeah, these are. These are his glasses. He loved these little birds. He knew every one by the sound of its voice. Such a sweet, sweet man. It's done. Here's his. I told them you'd call later with all the funeral arrangements and everything. Your brother. It's nearly midnight in Nairobi. We need to call him. I can't bear another conversation. You call David. God. No, mom. I don't think I can. - Sam, would you? - What? Really, that's not a good idea because he does not know me and I don't know him. It would be very weird. But yes. Of course. David. David Clayton. Hi, this is Sam briggs. I am your sister Mel's boyfriend. Mel. Melanie. Hi, I look forward to meeting you too. What? This is a really bad connection. So you know what, actually before we start chatting I have some very bad news about your father. Your father, yeah. Well... He's passed on. He's passed away. No, he's dead. No, no, no, he's dead! He's dead! Your dad is dead! He died! He's dead! Sam! What are you doing? He's on his cell phone. It's really bad coverage. Will you go to town and get my mom some more Valium? The pharmacy closes in, like, 15 minutes. David, can you hear me? It's Mel. Are you OK. Dick? Dick?! You're alive! You're al... You're alive! Angela. Angela, I got Dick. - Look what I found. - Sam. - It's Dick. He's here. - Take him back. What? Take my husband's body back to the undertaker. - No, you don't understand. - Take him back, you sick, sick. What's going on? Mel! They're fine. They actually kind of laughed about it. It was a quiet laughter. You Kinda had to stand like this to hear it. Come on. Not come on. I'm actually starting to wonder if something's wrong with me. Seriously, what happens to me when I get around these people? You're nervous. But the only thing that matters is that I love you. And we're having a baby, and the three of us, we're gonna live happily ever after. You know what, you're right. I'm good. I'm a good guy. There we go. And if that's not good enough for your dad, then too bad. Yeah. I'm a little turned on right now. Know what, i'm not even the one that should feel bad about this he is. Absolutely. Wait, for slipping on your pee or getting hit by your car? For making me feel uncomfortable. Come on, - we're gonna tell them about the baby. - Let's hold on a second. I will tell them right now, but wouldn't it be nice if you could do something, like, maybe something little that would erase what happened today from their minds? Yes, that's a great idea. Cleanse the palate. Let's do it. What? Thank you. This is great. - I've got it, Dick. - It's not I said I've got it, Dick. Okay, Jeez. Whatever. What am I gonna do, make the power go more out? What? Yes! What'd I do? Yes! Yes! What?! What?! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Please no. Please no. Please no. Lights are on, honey. You're my hero.
