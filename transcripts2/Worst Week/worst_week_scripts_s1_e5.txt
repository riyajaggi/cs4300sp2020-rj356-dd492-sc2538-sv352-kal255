NOW WE LOOK LIKE A TEAM. WE'RE NOT A TEAM. AND THAT WAS $400 ON MY ACCOUNT. OH. YOU BETTER BE GOOD AT TENNIS. DICK, ON THIS, I PROMISE I AM GOOD. I'M LIKE STEFFI GRAF. OR, WELL, DOES SHE STILL PLAY? WHOEVER'S CURRENTLY GOOD AND IS A MAN. THAT'S WHAT I'M GOOD AT. IT'S A LITTLE BIT MUCH. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE NEED TO PUT ON YOUR BALD SPOT- THAT SUN'S GONNA GET YOU GOOD. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

I DON'T KNOW, I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF SHARED BLAME HERE ON THIS ONE. LIKE A 60/40 SITUATION. I'LL TAKE THE 60. OKAY, 70/30, MY FINAL OFFER. CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING? WERE YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT HAPPY WHEN YOU THOUGHT THE WEDDING WAS OFF? YES. WOW. LOOK, SAM. I DON'T THINK THAT YOU'RE A BAD PERSON. BUT BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU ALL THE TIME. AND NOW THAT I'M WITH YOU, THEY'RE STARTING TO HAPPEN TO ME. SO FORGIVE ME IF I'M NOT THRILLED THAT MY DAUGHTER IS MARRYING SOMEONE WHO CAN'T SEEM TO DO THE SIMPLEST THING RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET THAT GAZEBO BACK, SO JUST CUT YOUR LOSSES. DICK, PLEASE TURN THE CART AROUND. NO. PLEASE, I'M JUST- IT'S DANGEROUS TO DRIVE ANGRY ANYWAY. PARKING BRAKE IS BROKEN. YEAH, I FIGURED THAT OUT. DICK, WAIT UP. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
