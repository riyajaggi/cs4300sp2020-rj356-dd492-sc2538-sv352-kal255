 Jane Doe. No leads at all, no ID? We're trying to reconstruct what it is she said. Coleman thinks he heard "dirty fix sheet." I heard "dirty sex." A dead woman was found down the street this morning. A possible homicide, no identification. Apparently destitute, homeless. - Got any money in the bank? - Not much. Couldn't happen to you, right? For God's sake, they're gonna dispose of the body, and nobody will ever know who she was. Her name was not Jane Doe number 37.

 The woman had a name, and I'm going to find out what it is. There are more opportunities for women in police work today than ever before. And I'm not only talking about career advancement. Police work also offers personal fulfillment, which I can vouch for, and a chance to serve humankind. Detective Cagney. Anybody have any questions? Anybody? Come on, girls. What is happening in high schools today? Can you believe the girls they sent us to talk to? I mean, like, "Well, do we get to meet really neat guys "and ride around in a really super car?" And like, "Are the uniforms really baggy or are they, like, sexy?"

 "Oh, wow." What is that? Isn't it you and me always complaining there aren't enough women on the force? So if they don't send us to recruit, who are they going to send, Isbecki? Perfect. Those bimbos would love him. Does this mean something, Mary Beth? I'm complaining about the younger generation. It means you're thinking about it, which means you are thinking about your birthday. - No, I'm... - Which means you are thinking about... Is your father still taking you to Montauk? No. He's going on a junket with his cronies to Atlantic City. - Oh, Chris, that's a drag. - I don't care. Well, come and have dinner with me and the family. No, but thanks anyway. How about Stewart? Can't he spring for birthday dinner? Mary Beth, I just want to forget my birthday this year, okay? Okay. Sure. Of course, there was this delicious cashmere sweater I saw at Bloomingdale's. I thought it would look so... - What color? - You'll never know. Wait a minute. You want the Knicks in how many points? - Just seven. - Just seven? Petrie, you know what a ganef is? Is that one of those subculture words, Lieutenant? You go on down to Delancey Street, and they'll tell you. In the meantime, get the hell out of here, will you? - All right. - I want to finish my lunch. Cagney, Lacey, in here. Oh, you don't wanna eat that, sir. Remember your stomach. Well, it's my stomach. What are you, my mother? No, sir. A case. For us? Does this mean we're off the recruiting detail? No, you're still on recruiting, and you got this case. LACEY: Thank you, sir. Jane Doe. What, no ID, no leads at all? Well, they found her body over by the river this morning. A little old bag lady with a rhinestone tiara. See if you can establish an ID so we can let the next of kin know and arrange for disposal of the body. - Any indication of rape or robbery? - Like I said, she's a little old bag lady. Probably one of her fellow vagrants eighty-sixed her for a pint of muscatel. - She must have had a name. - Probably a dozen names. Look, go on over there, ask some questions, write it up. I don't want you taking too much time away from recruiting. Wait a minute. Lieutenant, about this recruiting business, I... Christine. This is top department priority right now, direct from Gracie Mansion. Look, you wanna see the memos? No, sir. Thank you, sir. We'll look into the Jane Doe. Come on, Chris. Come on. What is the plan on this Jane Doe? So they walk by here a lot, and we just sit and wait, talk to some. Oh, look at that. I just saw her sister. Look at this. Look at the baby carriage. Let's go. Excuse me, ma'am, can we have a word with you? I know how to defend myself. Don't mess with me! We're police officers. I ain't broken no laws. I'm moving on. - You wanna go after her? - No. No, not a whole lot. What can she tell us anyway? Poor thing. It's a shame, though, isn't it, the way they live? There, but for the grace of God, go you or I. Not me, kid. Anyway, you wanna start with the corner bar? Sure. (HORN HONKING) Take backup, will you? I haven't got the energy. Got it. Hiya. Detective Lacey, 14th Squad. This is Detective Cagney. - You mind if we ask you a few questions? - What about? A dead woman was found down the street this morning. A possible homicide, no identification. Apparently destitute, homeless. You know anything about it? Look, I let them come in here and sleep now and then, but I don't get involved in their problems. She wore, like, a rhinestone tiara. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Mary Queen of Scots. Would you be more comfortable talking about this at the stationhouse? - 'Cause it doesn't matter to me. - Now, come on, come on. - He's wising off. - Give us a break here, fella. Look, she told everybody she was a descendant of Mary Queen of Scots, so that's what they called her. She was a little batty, but no worse than most of them. She live anywhere? A mission, resident hotel, maybe with a friend. Mostly the subway. Check out the ladies' room on the concourse level of the Port Authority. - A lot of the ladies use that facility. - Thank you. - Appreciate your help. - Don't mention it. I told her, you listen to Elsie and button up and move on. But she didn't listen and went and got herself dead. Serves her right. You talked to her last night? Hey, lady, look at me when I'm talking to you. Did you talk to her last night? I passed her on the BMT platform at Penn Station. She says she was going upstairs to tell the police. - She said she saw something bad happen. - What did she say she saw? Went to the police? Which precinct? I told her, "Mary, don't you be going to no police!" She said she was going, so I went downstairs to catch the local to Brooklyn, and old Mary went and got herself dead. Served her right! - Did you say Penn Station, the BMT line? - Yeah. 33rd and 7th, that's us. Here you are. Enrique Hernandez, William Norris, Theo Dimitri, Ira Melnick, Cleatus Jefferson. That's it, there are no women. What time did you get in this morning, Lubin? 7:00 a.m. You wanna talk to Coleman? He's on nights this week. Could you call him and ask him to get in here as fast as he can? He's probably sleeping now. He's not gonna appreciate it. Just give him a call, will you, Sergeant? Hey, Isbecki, what time did you get off last night? The usual, 5:30. Anybody from the day shift stay late? Yeah, why don't you check with La Guardia? He booked two hookers just before shift change. Thank you. - Hey, Paul. - Ladies. La Guardia, Isbecki said you got stuck late here last night. Unfortunately, two lovelies were holding up traffic on 8th Avenue. Well, did a woman come in here, a derelict type? Bag lady. They come in here all the time at night. It's warm. Wait a minute. There was a real fruitcake in here last night, talked to Coleman. Well, what did she say? Nothing memorable or even comprehensible for that matter. She'd had a bellyful, was looking to get locked up. - She give a name? - Name. Coleman said she was Mary the Queen of Scots. Fallen on hard times, no doubt. Harder than you think. - You don't remember anything she said? - (YAWNS) She was plastered. Oh, come on, Coleman, you must remember something. Think. - I'm not very alert in the morning. - It's 3:00 in the afternoon, Coleman. - Yeah, where were you at 4:00 a.m.? - Helping my son, Michael, throw up. The lady was mumbling about something, something about dirty something. Dirty? Dirty sex, wasn't that it? No, it was dirty... Fix. Dirty fix sheet. Maybe she ran numbers. Anything else? Red man. That's right, red man off of somewhere. Red man? Pier. Off a pier. Maybe an Indian on a pier. I still think it was dirty sex. Come on, La Guardia, you're booking too many hookers. Would somebody like to tell me what the hell's going on out here? LACEY: It's our Jane Doe, sir. Before she DOA'd, she showed up here. She talked to La Guardia and Coleman. We're trying to reconstruct what it is she said. - Well, what'd she say? - She was drunk, Lieutenant. Coleman thinks he heard "dirty fix sheet." I heard "dirty sex." - We both heard "red man." - Yeah, off a pier. Oh, wait a minute, there was something else. Hocus-pocus. Do you remember that, La Guardia? That's right. Hocus-pocus. What, have you people been drinking or something? No, Lieutenant, she was. The bag lady. Well, that's terrific. In the meantime, I would like to suggest that we all get back to work. Cagney and Lacey, check with the Medical Examiner's office, see if they put anything together. La Guardia, you're due in court on that arraignment. And Coleman, you... You go back to bed. Yes, sir. Ladies, don't forget. You're expected at City College, 5:00 p.m., Room 317, graduate employment seminar. One week. I'm giving him one week and then he can go get professional recruiters. - You want me to skip the Latin? - Yeah. We just need time of death, probable cause, identifications of M.O., identity of the victim. Oh, let's see. She bought it between 10:00 p.m. and midnight last night. "Cause of death, massive cerebral hemorrhage "brought on by blunt instrument trauma," blah-blah-blah-blah-blah. She got hit on the head? Very hard. Judging from the cranial fractures, it was a lead pipe, a tire iron or maybe a gun butt. - We didn't pick up any fragments. - Was she drunk? Blood alcohol level. Here we go, 0.10%. Technically, yes. She'd cop a DWI if she was stopped driving a car, but she wasn't blind drunk. Maybe a half bottle of wine. How about a physical description? "Five feet, four and a half inches, 97 pounds." - That's all she weighed? - What? Well, there was all sorts of evidence of malnutrition. She was missing some of her teeth. - LACEY: How old? - Now, that's weird. When I first laid her out, I had her around 50, maybe older. But her organs and skin tone showed she was much younger. I'd make her around 35. Thirty-five? You age fast when you live in the subways. All right, can you help us out at all on the ID? Well, we took photos and prints, but if she doesn't have a record, it's not gonna go anywhere. Clothing labels, possessions. The clothes were all old, without labels, indistinguishable. "Personal property: two subway tokens, 31 cents, "a corkscrew, a half-eaten candy bar, an empty lipstick tube, "a St. Anthony's medal and a rhinestone tiara." Okay, thanks. Send us the copy of that report, could you, Keppler? You got it. So, what happens to her, the usual? Yeah, if no one claims her in 15 days, we dump her in a city plot and throw some dirt over her. - Without a name? - But she's got a name. "Jane Doe number 37." Thank you. What? Oh, I just remembered something. Can you do that City College thing without me? Oh, you're kidding me. No, I'm sorry, I forgot I had a dental appointment that I made. I forgot all about it. I barely have time for a cab. Right. - So, will you cover for me? - Right. - I owe you one. - Right. Hey, keys. Right. Excuse me. The coffee's in the urn and dinner's served at 6:00. No, I need some information, if you could help me. - As soon as I finish setting up. - I'm a police officer, 14th Squad. Is this gonna take long? A woman was killed around here late last... Come here. Come with me. Come with me. I don't want any of them to hear about it. If they find out one of them's been killed, they'd get hysterical. And I've got hundreds of women just begging to sleep on my floor. Tell me something. Why is it you people only show up after one of them gets killed? We do what we can. Don't we all? The dead woman's name... Well, she called herself Mary Queen of Scot. (GASPS) Did you know her? I'm sorry. Can you tell me anything about her? Here, make yourself useful. Get that pot of potatoes and cut them into small pieces. Well, she used to come in here now and then. More then than now. She said to me that she didn't like to get handouts. So I did what I could for her, but... You do this every day? Yeah. Two meals a day when I've got something to feed them. I used to have beds in here, too, until the city cut me down. They said I wasn't up to code. They'd rather see those ladies sleeping in subways. Apparently it's healthier. Did she have any friends, do you know? No. These women don't form friendships. One tends to get a little paranoid when everything you own goes into a couple of shopping bags. - No, honey, make those slices smaller. - Sorry. - They gotta last a couple of days. - Okay. Oh, would you get me those carrots over there, please? Yeah. There must have been someone that she would talk to. A friend of some kind, huh? Yeah, there was a man she used to hang around with... - Here? - Right there. That's good. - ...called Maurice. - Maurice? Fiftyish. Short little man with a stubble. Hit the sauce a lot. Well, where can I find him? Oh, I don't know. I haven't seen him in weeks. Can't you tell me anything about her? I mean, the woman had a real name. She must have come from somewhere. (CHUCKLES) - What, is that funny? - Oh, no, it's just... Probably East Podunk. I mean, a typical woman comes to New York looking for work or excitement or whatever. She gets a job, she loses a job. She falls a couple of months behind in rent, so they throw her out of her apartment. And she puts all of her things in a subway locker. And she sleeps on the train one night, two nights, maybe three nights. Before she knows it, it's a way of life. You'd be amazed how many of them there are out there. A lot of them started out just like you, pretty, middle-class ladies. You married, honey? - Got any money in the bank? - Not much. Couldn't happen to you, right? Of course not. It always happens to somebody else. It's funny. You start off being queen of the senior prom, and you wind up being queen of the BMT. You take it out of the oven when the top is light brown. Light brown means light brown, Harv, as opposed to dark brown. Honey, if you overcook my lasagna, you're gonna wear it. All right, I gotta go. I'll talk to you in a while. How's the tooth? Much better. Thank you. - How was City College? - Oh, you would have loved it. They wanted to know all about early retirement and pension benefits. One girl asked me, did she have to pay her parking tickets if she joins the force? Listen, do you want to come home and eat lasagna with us? It ought to be pretty good if Harvey doesn't worry it to death. Oh, no, thanks. I'm gonna just do some work tonight. Do you need me to stay? No, I want you to go home. You sound awful. Go to bed, you take the pasta with you. And if there's any left, you bring me some tomorrow. All right. Are you sure? Yes, it's much better the second day, much. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Love to Harvey and the kids. (THUNDER) (SIREN WAILING) - Nippy out there this morning, isn't it? - Yeah. I hate to send my boys down in weather like this. You want some of this? - No, thanks. - You sure? No, it's okay. Regulations permit a sip of medicinal brandy when you're diving. If they don't find something pretty soon, I'm gonna bring them up. Maybe the body drifted, you know. (FOGHORN BLOWING) How long have you been diving for stiffs, Detective? MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER: Lieutenant, we got something. (SIREN WAILING) Yes, Captain. Yeah, we'll make sure they get all the paperwork. Right. Benny Bartelli, smalltime mob boss from Brooklyn. He was handcuffed with two slugs in his head. Positive ID? Oh, yeah. Organized Crime Control Bureau's got a whole book on this guy. - So, can we get right on it? - Nope. Well, what do you mean, sir? It was Chris who turned up the body. Come on, Lieutenant, it's our case. It was your case, not anymore. You can go back to recruiting now. Organized Crime's got jurisdiction over all gang-related cases. What about Jane Doe? She's not involved with the mob. Yeah, well, they're operating on a theory that the two cases are connected. You see, she witnessed a dumping, right? So, presumably, the same guy who killed Bartelli came back to get her to keep her from talking. - Sound plausible? - Yes, sir. Okay, Cagney, you've gotta get up to OCCB sometime today and turn over your case file. The investigating officer's name is Travis, Gilbert Travis. It isn't fair, sir. Since when is life fair, huh, Lacey? But I tell you, I've got some terrific news for you. I got a phone call today from Community Affairs, and they love the job you've been doing in recruiting. Well, I'm glad somebody's getting a bang out of it. SAMUELS: Matter of fact, they've been trying to clear funds for some kind of a TV commercial. You know, a "Join the force, see the world," kind of a thing. And today, finally, authorization came through, and guess who they have chosen to star in it? The both of youse. - Us? - No. What'd you get? Perfect. Absolutely perfect. Something to drink? White wine, mineral water? No, thank you. Terrific look, just terrific. You understand that we've never done this type of thing before. Nothing to worry about. All you have to do is act natural. Well, we're not actors, we're police officers. That's just what I want, real people. I wanna give this spot the feel of the streets. Well, we know streets. We can give you streets. Precisely. You'll be coming from your gut. Motivation, dimension, with a patina of realism over the glitz. Look, could we just do whatever it is you do? I'm kind of pressed for time. Sure, sure. You know... I was afraid they were gonna send me a couple of blonde beach bunnies, straight from Malibu. But you two, you've got the "girl on the subway" look, real, down-to-earth, and not overly good-looking. You mean it? It's us. (LAUGHS) Did Chris come in? Hey, isn't that Loretta Lacey, the movie star? She looks even better in person than she does on the screen. Have you seen her latest picture, Gentlemen Prefer Cops? Fabulous, fabulous. I'm going to get her autograph. Miss Lacey, would you sign my rap sheet? Knock it off. - Temperamental, isn't she? - I should say so. Hurray for Hollywood. (SINGS) Hollywood. (LAUGHING) Jealous. Jealous. Jealous. (GIGGLING) (PHONE RINGING) - Detective Lacey, 14th Squad. - Hi. Hiya. - What happened at OCCB? - Nothing. I turned over my case file and they thanked me. - Anything on our Jane Doe? - Nope. As soon as I told them she probably had nothing to do with Bartelli, they just tuned out on everything else I had to say. - Well, that stinks. - I thought so. Listen, will you tell Samuels I went straight home after OCCB? Say I went away for the weekend. Is that what I'm saying or is that what you're doing? Well, you just have a nice one with Harvey and the boys. - All right, Chris, about your birthday... - Mary Beth, you promised to stop it. I broke down. I went to Bloomingdale's anyway. The sweater is buttercup yellow with covered buttons. - Mary Beth... - Happy birthday. Thank you. What did you do, Maurice? Knock over a parking meter? $0.90, $0.95, $1.10, $1.20... One, two, three, four and five. Give me a shot of your good Scotch. - What'll it be? - Beer. You again. Look, I told you everything I knew. I'm looking for a guy named Maurice. Can you help me? (WHISPERS) The hat? Thank you. Maurice? Can't you let a man have a drink in peace? I heard you knew Mary. I don't mind telling you, I am fed up to here with you people. Got no social graces. Come around here like a locust asking questions. - No manners. I hate cops. - I'm not a cop. (GRUNTS) Glad to hear it. They don't even have the decency to buy you a drink. You're kidding. That's awful. Could we have a drink over here, please? And just keep the bottle. Mary was my aunt and I'm trying to find out what happened to her. From Springfield? - Yes, that's right. - Shame about Mary. Should've kept her mouth shut. (SIGHS) - Here you go. - I can tell. - You've been brought up right. - Thank you. When was the last time you saw Mary? The night she got killed. It was right after she went to the cops. They wouldn't listen to her so she told me. What'd she tell you? I didn't tell the cops this because they don't have no manners. - That's what I've heard. - Yeah. But she saw what was written on the truck. What do you mean? Pandora Trucking Inc. Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey. (WHEEZY LAUGHING) I love that word, Ho-Ho-Kus. - Sounds like Pocahontas, yeah? - Yeah. - What else did she tell you? - Nothing. Just that she was scared and was gonna head for Port Authority where there are people around. Maurice, let me give you my home phone number. All right? I want you to call me if you remember anything more about that night. You call me day or night, okay? I'm gonna put it right up here. There it is. I'm glad Mary had a friend. That bottle is nearly half gone already, isn't it? The trucking company is in Ho-Ho-Kus. Hocus-pocus, Pocahontas, get it? Forget it. Can you just run it through your computer? The operator already went home. In fact, you're lucky you caught me here. I'm usually long gone by this hour. But they could be watching the bar. They could get Maurice. The longer we wait on this, the easier it's gonna be for them to bury it. I don't think you understand how we operate this unit. This isn't the SWAT team. We like to move carefully here. You've already got two murders here. Do you know how many mob murders there are in the city every year? Would you at least follow up on the identification of Jane Doe? All right. How do you propose I do that? You call up the Springfield, Pennsylvania Police Department and find out if there's a Missing Persons file on her. Okay, we'll look into it. - Springfield, you say? - Yeah. I better hurry. I'm gonna miss that last express to Conark. - When? - 10:23. No, I mean, when are you gonna check on Springfield? It's gonna take some time. For God's sake, they're gonna dispose of the body, and nobody will ever know who she was. There was no material evidence on the body. You aren't even gonna check on the Springfield tip, are you? Sure we are, I'll let you know if we come up with something. Okay? Don't bother. (DOOR BUZZING) - What time is it? - 12:12. (COUGHS) Who visits at this hour, huh? It's probably 4B, drunk again. Razudo, if that's who it is I'm gonna kill him. That's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna kill him. (INSISTENT BUZZING) All right. All right. It's Chris. - Champagne. - Do you have any idea what time it is? I wanna drink champagne. You'll notice that we're drinking this fine French champagne out of tacky plastic American cups. Well, we got good glasses here. That is because all of my crystal has been smashed to pieces, the Irish crystal that my mother left me. Chris, would you please tell me what's going on? It's my birthday. My father stood me up. Stewart is off God-knows-where. You and I are stuck on that lousy recruiting assignment which I hate. And my loft was just completely trashed. So, who says you can't have it all? Cheers. Oh, Chris, your loft? The crystal in your loft? How could they do that? You're a cop for God's sake. Don't they know you're a cop? They took the pictures of my parents when they were still together and cut them all up. They took knives and slashed all of my couches. They threw ketchup all over everything, my clothes, my... The note said, "Back off!" Do you love it? I'm telling you, Mary Beth, I'm gonna nail those bastards. Sure, that's it, Chris. You get angry... Now, wait, don't talk nonsense here. You're scaring me now. You let OCCB handle that, that's what they get paid for. OCCB, what, like they care! What about Mary? Do you think OCCB cares about her? Hell, no. Harvey, this woman died weighing 97 pounds. She was Mary Beth's and my age. Now, you tell me how this happened. She died. No family, no friends, and her entire life ended up in a shopping bag. Well, Chris, it happens. It happens in life. - It could happen to any one of us. - Not to me! I don't know. She just died so alone and no one... - We all of us die alone, Christine. - But we die with a name. Her name was not Jane Doe number 37. The woman had a name, and I'm going to find out what it is. Yeah. Mary Queen of Scots. (SIRENS WAILING) As you can see, police work is rewarding and fulfilling. - It affords a professional opportunity... - Cut! (SIGHS) That's not quite it, honey. I don't want you to be looking there when you're saying your lines. Where am I supposed to be looking? You're supposed to be looking at the camera. But you said the bad guys were over there. The bad guys are over there, but I need you to look at the camera. Right. - Okay! Let's do it again. - We're doing it again. Cut! As you can see, police work is rewarding and fulfilling. The department offers training programs in criminology and... - (MUMBLES) Community relations. - Cut! I know it. Community relations. Terrific! As you can see, police work is exciting and fulfilling. And... Cut! (MUTTERING) Community relations. To top it off, there's training programs... - Cut! - What? Cut! Cut! Cut! There's never been a better time for women to join the force. You can continue with your education while serving in the NPYD. Cut. - NYPD. - Suppose we take a break, okay? I'm sorry. I never felt so stupid in my entire life. That's all right. This is a very stupid business. - I'd be worried about you if you didn't. - He's terribly disappointed with me. Would you hold this for me, please? Do you care if he's disappointed? Come on. I... Hey, Cagney. - New career? - Look, I'm kind of busy. I just thought you'd like to know that your lead panned out. It led us to Pandora Trucking, a front operated by a wise guy from Queens. We think we know who the trigger man was. - Terrific. - Wait a minute. I'm going out to make the collar now. You want to come? You don't need me. I don't suppose we do, but I thought you might like to be in on it. Sorry, Mary Beth. - Christine! - I owe you two. What? Where's she going? She can't leave. She just did, sir. Bronson, Cagney. Cagney, Bronson. - Hi. - Any movement in there? - No, sir. - Better send a man around back. Sweeney, around back. All right, let's go. Stay close to me. - Open up! Police! - GIRL: Mommy. - I hear someone. - Mommy. Kravick, we have the house surrounded! Open the door slowly and come out with your hands high in the air! Do you hear me? You want to bust it down? WOMAN: He's not here. I don't know where he is. You'll have to open up, ma'am. I'll get the teargas. No, wait a minute! Come on, there's a baby in there. She's right. Bust it. He's not here. I swear it. Search it. - Where is he? - I don't know. He went out last night, he didn't come home. - Did he take his car with him? - Yes. Is that it in the driveway? Yes. Oh, my God. Victor. Oh, my God! No, Victor! Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no! (WOMAN SOBBING) Lacey. Please. Sit down. Go ahead. Sit down, please. How's your cold? It's nothing, sir. It's probably just stardust. - I'm gonna give this to you straight. - What? Sometimes things just don't work out. - You know what I mean? - Sir? Sometimes things are entirely outside of our control. Could we get to the point, sir? I just got a phone call from Community Relations. They're firing you and Cagney off of the commercial. - Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - What, are you happy? Well, sir, I got no business being an actress. Well, matter of fact, they're hiring a couple of real ones. So they probably got some blonde beach bunnies off of Malibu, right? Probably, yeah. Yeah. Well, that's show business. If you say so, sir. - Take care of your cold, Lacey. - Yes, sir. Hey, Officer Cagney, guess what? Chris, we got fired off of that commercial. Are you glad? Oh, yeah, that's great. So, did you go out there on that collar with them? - Yeah. - And? And I wish I hadn't. (PHONE RINGING) Detective Lacey, 14th. Yeah, hold on. Chris, it's that records clerk from Springfield. On three. Detective Cagney. Yes, that's right. Okay. All right, thank you very much. Yeah, I will have that verified and I'll get back to you. What is that? "Mary Dunston, age 34, disappeared April 7, 1977." - Is that her? - Probably. "Married and two children." So, she had a husband, she had a family. Hey, are you crying? No. (SOBS) What're you... Pull yourself together. Come on. Take this. What're you crying for? Hell, nobody else is. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. - Thank you. - Sure. Give me that, please.
