 Don't say that I never do you two favors. Homicide? All right. How did you get the nerve to ask him out? I showed him my badge and I told him to follow me. These damn appellate judges, they overturned a conviction based on one lousy technicality. A woman's life is being ruined, do they know or care? Hell, no. Four men raped me. I don't believe it. Our open and shut case is falling apart right before our eyes. The defendant shouldn't suffer because his lawyer is a bozo. As far as I am concerned, that woman has been raped twice.

 Once by those creeps and once by the courts. And could you tell us what you saw? May I please refer to my investigative report? Of course. I saw the defendant leave the residence at 1082 Broome Street, walk approximately half a block to a 1980 sedan, New York license plate 352-QAV, which I took note of. The defendant got into the car at which time Officer Johnston, who has already testified, approached him and put him under arrest. Thank you. No further questions. I spent two and a half days hanging around that courtroom waiting to testify. I'm on the stand less than five minutes.

 And everybody complains there's not enough cops on the street. So, did you nail him? No, they knocked it down to possession of stolen property, he copped a plea and I wasted two-and-one-half-days. How we doing on that Moskowitz thing? They picked him up in Jersey. Here. - Believe it or not, we are all clear. - Oh, yeah? So, come on, tell me. What do you think? Too fluffy for my image? I don't know. If it doesn't have four doors, I've never heard of it. Pretty macho, isn't it, shifting your own gears? If I remember correctly, I saw one of these assault a Volkswagen once. You still trying to decide on a car? - Yeah. - Cagney, let me give you a suggestion. Studebaker. I've had mine for 12 years now, never had a day's problem. Why don't people buy American anymore? No wonder the whole country's falling apart. Studebaker. I don't know, I was just thinking of something that maybe had a little more sex appeal. If you're thinking of something with a little more... Don't even say it. Don't say that I never do you two favors. - What is it? - A stabbing. Homicide? All right. Open and shut case, all you gotta do is fill in the blanks. Thank you, sir. A Turk. Bloody butchering Turk at an Armenian clan party. What would you smart ladies think happens? - A fight breaks out. - You call it a fight? When a bloody butchering Turk totally out of the blue sky pulls a knife and kills my cousin. - This was totally unprovoked? - Totally. The Armenian massacres all over again. And you, yourself, witnessed the stabbing, Mr. Menukian? Of course, of course. I saw the whole thing. My sister, she saw the whole thing. My brother-in-law, he saw the whole thing. My son saw the whole thing. My wife saw the whole thing. That's enough? Well, we'd like to talk to everyone who's a witness. Okay. My girlfriend, she saw the whole thing, too. - Hello. - How was it? Chalk one up for our side. We got six eye witnesses champing at the bit to testify. Not to mention, we go in to arrest this alleged knife murderer and he's got a 10-inch switchblade in his pocket. - And a rap sheet as long as your arm. - Did you get a signed statement? He was not real chatty. I only get confident when I have a confession. Six eye witnesses? I think I might be inclined to feel confident. Well, it's quite obvious why the ladies on the squad have the highest conviction percentage. Lieutenant Samuels keeps giving you the slow grounders. Oh, right. Like the Dock Street burglary, that was a real piece of cake. One thing you'll admit, sweet little homicide collar like this isn't going to hurt your chances for sergeant any. I thought of that. What do you think of this for a police sergeant? - Not too bubblehead, huh? - Should be orange. - Elizabeth? - Mary Beth. Hiya. What's the matter? - Could I talk to you alone? - Of course, sure. We'll go inside. - Okay. - Are you all right? Please. Sure, come on. Right over here. - Sit down. - I didn't know where to find you. Well, we made detective. Fine. You want coffee? Or we have hot water for tea. - Tea, yes. Tea. Thank you. - Sit, sit down. Go ahead. - La Guardia. - Yeah. Can I have one of your tea bags? We're all out over there. - Sure. - Thanks. Thank you. Herbal Blitz? It's 100% organic, no caffeine. They did a study at the University of Massachusetts medical... Isn't that great, huh? That's great. Thanks, La Guardia, I've got to take it in to her. Chris, who is she? I don't remember seeing her around. When Mary Beth and I were in uniform, a group assault. Sexual? - Poor lady. - I'll say. Especially since the lousy defense lawyer had all the cases severed. First she had to face the grand jury, then four separate trials. She went through absolute hell but she put every one of those bastards away. - Something happen now? - Going to find out. So, how is that nice man of yours? - What? Peter, right? - Yes, Peter. I remember he was so good with you going to trial and everything. - Yes, yes. He was. - Herbal okay? - Yes, thank you. - Good. He really was torn up, you know, about my having to talk about all that in front of strangers. We split up. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, I was impossible to live with. Two years in court, telling that horrible story over and over again and... And, you know, I started to hate Peter. Just for being a man. I cringed when he touched me. Well, finally, he had enough and, well, who could blame him. Well, you were nice together. - Maybe you can talk about it, work it out. - He got married last month. CAGNEY: Oh, God. I'm sorry. I lost my job, too. I missed so many days for court appearances that they finally had to let me go. Was there really a point to all of this? Yes, without you, we would never have been able to convict those guys, they would still be out on the street. I was starting to get my life together again. Really. And now... And now, it's gonna start all over again. What do you mean? They overturned Sordell's conviction. - And there's gonna be a new trial. - Oh, God. I can't face it. I can't. Please. Please. You have to help me get out of this. Mary Beth, please. These damn appellate judges, they overturned a conviction based on one lousy technicality. A woman's life is being ruined, do they know or care? Hell, no. I think Elizabeth is right. I think she's done enough already. - You can't tell her that. - Why not? What, and get Sordell off, is that what you want to do? No. Now, don't you try and twist me around like that. I'm saying that the woman should not have to go through all that again. Well, she doesn't have much choice. All right. If she refuses to show up, she'll be held in contempt of court. Well, then, she could say she lost her memory. - You're not serious. - Let them prove different. That's perjury. I can't believe you'd suggest that to her. Damn it, Christine, you've seen what defense lawyers can do. Hounding and harassing and all the lawyer tricks and their smutty little insinuations. Think how she feels. I'm sorry for her. Her dignity, her job, her boyfriend, her self esteem is all down the tubes, what for? So Sordell and his scuzzball friends don't rape another woman. All right, so what is your solution? What do you want to tell her? You want to tell her to go back there and tear herself apart again? No, I just don't want to talk about it anymore. Could we just save it for tomorrow? Yeah, okay. All right. You and Harvey still want to go look for cars? Oh, yeah. I couldn't talk him out of that if I wanted to. Thanks. - I'll see you what, around 10:00? - Yeah. What, you got a date tonight? Yeah, well, I'm gonna cancel, I'd be lousy company. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - I'll see you. Good night. - Say, fellow, what are you doing? - We're ready, we're ready. This lady, she wants to buy a car. All right. Harvey, I really appreciate your opinion on this. He really knows his cars. Yeah. Well, I just want to make sure no one pulls a fast one on you just 'cause you're a woman. You can give them real good odds. Yeah, you got the want ads, right? - I got it, yeah. - You got the keys? - What? - I'll get the keys. Don't forget, you promised us a ride to California. - To California? - Yeah. Wanna see where E.T. lives. That's dumb. - Dumb is a little strong. - E.T. doesn't live in California. What do you know? Besides, I'd rather see Victoria Principal. All right, come on, you guys, on a roll. Let's go, let's move it. He wants to go to California to see Victoria Principal. That is ridiculous. The only reason to go to California is to see Fred Astaire. I love Fred Astaire, I've always loved Fred Astaire. - Here, take it for a test drive. - CAGNEY: Yeah. Here, maybe I should do this first, huh? All right. - What do you think? - It's very cute. - All right. - No, it's not... Come here, get out of here. - Don't hurt it. - Wait. Sorry, kids. (ENGINE REVVING) HARVEY JR.: Let's hurry up. Come on, here we go. Ready? So... I don't think that we can avoid it much longer, do you? Elizabeth Carter. I promised I'd call her this afternoon. What do I tell her? That she has a responsibility. Mary Beth, it's wrong to encourage her to quit. For God's sake, it's illegal. Come on. I had another idea. What if we promise her we'll go with her to the trial? It's not our case anymore, we haven't even been subpoenaed. - We take a vacation day. - Or two or three? She needs somebody there, Chris. Mary Beth, I feel for her. Really, I do. I hate that when you think I'm such a hard case. No. We simply cannot babysit the whole world. It's not the whole world, it's Elizabeth Carter. She needs somebody in her corner, I don't think she gonna be able to do it. And then another rapist just takes a walk. If you don't want to do it I'll go myself. - Now you're mad. - I'm not mad. We're not the Bobbsey twins. We don't have to do everything together. (CAR HORN HONKING) Michael, get over here. - So? - So, huh. Yeah? - Doll, isn't she? - I don't know. - What do you think, Harvey? Is she okay? - I like it. - Do you? - Yeah. - You like it? - LACEY: It's cute. - You want to talk money? - Don't bother, Christine. It's a pass. - Why? - SALESMAN: What do you mean, man? - This is a great little car. - If you look real close you see the paint don't match between here and the door plate. That's no problem. If you don't like it, you repaint it again. Take off 50 bucks. And look here. See those ripples on the door? This car has been in a head-on collision. You want to put it up on jacks, huh? We'll take a look at the underside. It shimmies when you drive. I'll bet you anything you like the frame's bent. Listen, lady. If you don't want the car it's fine with me. But you're missing a real good buy, I'm telling you. - I'll recover. Thanks anyway. - Yeah. - Come on, let's go. - Thank you, pal. I think it's a piece of junk. This is not my favorite thing, coming here. Hey, don't look at me. I invited him out to lunch. Anywhere he wanted, our treat. - And? - He insists he loves to eat on the job. - That's disgusting. - Yeah. - You're here about... - Aaron Rapozian, the stabbing. Right, interesting case. Another intriguing case that one, death by crushing. You don't see many of those. Are you sure you two ladies wouldn't like to attend an autopsy while we confer? - No, thank you. - Sounds fascinating. Really, we're just a little pressed for time. If you'll excuse the expression, death by crushing, pressed for time. You like puns, too. It was unintentional. Believe me, it was unintentional. Doctor, so as not to waste any more of your time, is it fair to say, and would you so testify, that the cause of death was a puncture wound of the type suggesting a switchblade knife? I like the way you plunge right in. If you'll excuse the expression. But that's not exactly the truth. - It isn't? - No. What is exactly the truth? Exactly, I would have to say that Mr. Kamal could not possibly have directly caused the cessation of life processes in Mr. Rapozian. The victim was not killed by the defendant? I would say not. Well, how did he die? Don't you want to take a stab at it? If you'll excuse the expression. Doctor, I just don't have time to play games. Do you or do you not know how Mr. Rapozian died? Well, I'd have to say, the emergency room doctor killed him. - The emergency room doctor? - I don't understand. - LACEY: The doctor killed Rapozian? - That's what I'd say. You see, when first brought into the emergency room, Mr. Rapozian was suffering from nothing worse than a puncture wound to the left lung. That's not serious? Oh, serious, yes. But not life threatening. In fact, some years ago, the quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams played an entire game with a collapsed lung. Great. So, what happened to our victim? God knows why, but for some obscure reason the good doctor got it into his head that Mr. Rapozian needed open heart massage. Pity. He was a fine physical specimen. You should see his organs, very clean. Are you saying the doctor killed him giving him an open heart massage? Most assuredly. You see, opening him up, he punctured the aortal wall, drove right into the heart, killed him instantly. That's what happened. Cutting right to the heart of the matter. - If you'll excuse the expression. - Excuse the expression. I know. Dr. Ravshad is no longer associated with this hospital, I'm afraid. I'd be more afraid if he was. Could you tell us how we could get hold of him? - We think he went back to Pakistan. - You think? Don't you know for sure? The man should not be let anywhere near a scalpel. I guess you'll read about it in the news tomorrow. There's a good chance that Ravshad is not a doctor. We have indications that his credentials were forged. Oh, great. Do you realize I gave birth to Harv Jr. in this hospital? I can assure you we revoked his privileges as soon as we found out. Nothing like this has ever happened here before. If I ever get pregnant again I'm looking into home delivery. I don't believe it. Our open and shut case is falling apart right before our eyes. I got to check in. They had Elizabeth on hold in case they finish with jury selection. Got to talk to the D.A., you can call from his office. Isn't that cute? Wait a minute. - How much are you asking? - Five even. - Too much. - Hey, make me an offer. - What? Right here? - I'll drive around the block. - No, I've got to be somewhere, I'll call you. - Okay, yeah. Do that. Hey, I'm sure that we can work something out. Ladies, this is my first big homicide case. It's a dead bang winner which pleases me very much. - There's no extra charge for sitting down. - Oh, sorry. What does not please me, however, is getting these negative waves from my investigating officers. It's not negative waves, sir. It's evidence. Relevant evidence concerning the cause of death. And where did you go to law school, Detective Lacey? I didn't, sir. - But it would seem to change things. - Not in the least. The principle is called proximate cause, Detective Lacey. Even though the immediate cause of death was the emergency room procedure, the stab wound was inflicted by the defendant, which in turn necessitated the visit to the emergency room. And thus it was the proximate cause. - So you're saying it's still a homicide? - Absolutely. As far as I am concerned, this is an open and shut case. CAGNEY: Where is she? Court 32 was this floor. I should have called earlier. - You think it's fair? - What? Proximate cause, immediate cause. Do you think it's murder? Well, if he hadn't stabbed the guy in the first place he wouldn't have been put in the position of being killed. - That seems to be their point. - If you'll excuse the expression. Don't do that to me. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - What's been happening? They seem to have adjourned. - What happened? - Nothing out of the ordinary. Assistant D.A. calls me in. I sit here all day from 8:00 in the morning and she doesn't even have enough time to talk to me. Very nice. At 4:30 the defense lawyer asks for a continuance and of course, the judge says it's okay. - 4:30? - Yes, 4:30. Well, you know their game plan, Elizabeth. Harass the witness bad enough so she gives up and the judge dismisses the case. Mary Beth, I really hate being such a cry baby. Really, really, I do. But I don't know how much more of this I can take. Why don't we just forget all this, huh? Want to go get silly? - Silly? - Silly, come on, here. - Here. - Let's go. - Where you taking me? - We're getting silly. Silliness very important. - Where are we going? - Follow this woman. Rule number one is you have to hold your mouth right. (MUSIC PLA YING ON STEREO) (WOMEN LAUGHING) Would you stop! A male stripper? I mean, you went out. - How did you... - She did. She certainly did. It's true. How did you get the nerve to ask him out? I showed him my badge and I told him to follow me. - He turned out to be a PhD from Columbia. - Really? She has all the luck in the world. I'm not kidding. I'll tell you one thing about taking home a stripper, at least you know what to expect. (CAGNEY AND ELIZABETH LAUGHING) CAGNEY: Right? No surprises. There's a man at the bar who's looking at you. Who? - You. At you. - He is, he is. Don't look around. - What are you... - No. - He's looking at Chris. - He is. He's very nice. Very nice. He's trying to get up the nerve to come over here. (CLEARS THROAT) Three women are very intimidating. - All right, I'm going home. - No. Sit down, stay. No, I'm going home because I feel silly. I'm here and Harv is at home. - And I feel kind of... - Guilty for having a good time. - That's it. - Guilty for having a good time. - Married life. - What do you know about married life? Absolutely nothing. She smiled. Speaking of married life, Elizabeth, - I've been thinking. - Great. Let's stop. That's good. I don't need this, Elizabeth, all right? - I've been thinking about you. - Oh, really? - Yes. - What? What? I have somebody for you, a great guy. - Pass, no. No dates. - Why not? - Come on. - No dates, I'm not dating. - Give me one good reason. - Listen, I'm just... Don't have the right attitude, okay? Wait a minute. All right? Now, it is time. You cannot crucify the entire male population because of - the actions of four subhumans. - Okay. Anyway, this guy is terrific. He's wonderful. I used to go out with him. - Which one? - Barney. Oh, he's a doll. This is a very nice man. And besides, you have to do it anyway because it's part of Christine's philosophy of dating. Which is, never throw out a man if you can recycle him to a friend. - Mary Beth, you're making that up. - That's right. You're making that up. I don't believe that. No. - Listen, hold my hand, hold my hand. - What? - I'm telling you... - All right. I want you to think of this as a sacred trust. There are not that good many men, there are not that many... Hello. There are not that many good men to go around, do you hear me? - So, when you find a goodie... - Yeah. - ...and you're tired of him, you know... - Christine. Hey, come on. You owe it to the women of New York to keep them circulating. - This is getting very boring. - It's true. - Excuse me. - Hello. - Would you like to dance? - Me? No, I can't dance, I'm married. - What is that? - What did I say? - You guys are so good for my head. - We like you, too. We do. Thank you. No, really, for everything. I mean, I guess you know I couldn't go through this thing without you guys' support. You got it. We are there for you. Well, I mean, you can call me up anytime. - What? Us. You call us up anytime. - Anytime. - We will be there for you. - Absolutely. Wait a minute. Three musketeers. - Here I come, come on. - What are you doing? You're crazy. People are looking at us. Mes amis, your coach awaits. Just get it in there. - ELIZABETH: Do you know what I wish? - What do you wish? I wish that I could whistle like you whistled. I don't blame you! How could my arms have grown? I don't think I've worn this stupid suit since sorority rush. You look nice. I feel like I'm going to a costume party. Oh, I don't know. Harv kind of likes it when I dress up for court. Says I look like a lady. Yeah. Real comfortable, too, huh? Credibility clothes. - Remember the Esteban case? - Yeah. The Assistant D.A. told me that I would have more credibility with the jury if I wore nylons. - What, stockings? - Stockings. Yes. And then he told me, I'm quoting him verbatim, "Listen, Cagney, could you frump it way down?" What is it? - He never told me that. - Oh. Oh, well. Oh, Mary Beth, I'm so tired of looking at car ads. Do you remember that little green sports car - we saw near the hospital? - Yeah. - Do you like it? - Sure. I'm about to do something very impetuous. If he hasn't already sold it, I'm gonna buy it. Congratulations. I'll call from the courthouse. I'll pick it up tonight. When do you think we'll be through, 5:00, 5:30? Yeah, 5:00 the latest. - You ever see a judge be late for dinner? - No. You don't think Elizabeth will be mad, do you? Why? Well, our murder case coming up the same day as her case. - No. - I guess we couldn't help it. No, she'll understand. So, I guess I will stay with her and you can help the D.A. on that Kamal thing, okay? Unless, you'd rather be with her. No, she'd probably be more comfortable with you, anyway. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Maybe we ought to let her decide. Anyway, you get first dibs. You want blonde or brown? (LAUGHING) Would you, Chris? Me? Sure. Get this show on the road. Okay, you all ready to testify? Me? What, now? What happened to jury selection and opening statements - and all that business? - We did all that last week. I didn't call you till I was ready for you. Oh. "Oh"? What's wrong with that? Isn't that what you cops are always asking for? Don't want to waste the taxpayers' money sitting around the courtroom all day. - Right? - Right. - But... - But? Well... Mr. Leffler, I know that this is gonna sound stupid to you. - But I get, like, a stage fright. - Oh, terrific. No, I'm okay. I just need to work my way up to it for a day or so. - No can do. You've gotta go today. - All right. Give me an hour or two. I'll be fine. I know I will. Nope, sorry. You're on first. Then I need you to testify and help me, assist me, for the rest of the day. Well, the assisting part, there's no problem with that. It's the testifying without the working up to it. Just can the stage fright, okay. You're not even testifying to anything that important. Unfortunately, sir, that has never stopped me from getting nervous before. Look, I'm telling you. Just erase nervous from your memory bank. - Jurors don't trust a cop who's uptight. - Right. I don't know if you thought about this, Mr. Leffler, but that did not make me feel any calmer. You'll be fine. - Defense Attorney's a real zip wad. - Great. You say, Officer Lacey, that you were at the alleged scene of the alleged murder in person? Yes, sir, that is correct. And what did you find at that time to be the dimensions of the alleged room in question? I have a diagram, sir, if I may refer to my report of the investigation. - From your memory, Detective Lacey. - From memory? Are you trying to tell us that you don't have any independent memory - of such an important piece of evidence? - Objection. The witness should be allowed to refresh her memory without Mr. Pressman's impugning her credibility. Can't we get on with this, please? (CLEARS THROAT) Do you have any memory without your notes? Yes, sir. I do have some memory but I've always been allowed to look... Try it without. - Your Honor... - Just try it. Let's do it fast and get on with it. Objection overruled. Thank you, Your Honor. Dimensions please. So the guy is gonna sell it to somebody else. Not if I get there by 5:30. - Oh. - No problem. Come on. We'll be out of here in plenty of time. Well, I hope so. Wait till you see it. British racing green. Four-on-the-floor, wire wheels. It's very sexy. And the guy's coming down 500 bucks on the original price. Oh, that's wonderful. But, you know, to tell you the truth, even if I could afford a car like that I would be so nervous about driving in the city. Those potholes... Miss Gallegos. I'm sorry. I've only got a five-minute recess. We'll get you today, Miss Carter, I promise we will. I appreciate your patience. So, wanna hear about the cars I didn't buy? There was one sweet one. Honest to God, that guy was perverse as hell, but the car was so cute. Now, Officer Lacey. If you'd be so kind as to step over to this board and attempt to recreate for us the alleged scene of the alleged murder. Doors and windows. Furniture. The works. You mean, draw it? I have a diagram right here. Does the court note some reluctance to be cooperative on your part, Officer? No, sir. It's just I'm not much of an artist. (PRESSMAN CHUCKLING) Yeah. You're not much of a memory expert, either. - Isn't that so? - Objection. Mr. Pressman is deliberately trying to confuse the witness and the jury. And perhaps Mr. Leffler and his representative from the police department are deliberately trying to keep something from the jury. Your Honor, could I just refer to my notes? Objection. The witness is admonished to speak only in direct answers - to the questions placed before her. - Thank you, Your Honor. Your Honor, all Officer Lacey is doing is trying to be exact in her answers. Isn't that what this court is here for? To find the exact truth, so that justice may be served? And I believe that truth and justice might best be served by Officer Lacey if she's allowed to be as exact as possible. Mr. Leffler, you've been watching too much Perry Mason. - Can we just get on with it? - Thank you, Your Honor. - Officer. - Thank you. You're welcome. So, did you call Barney yet? Chris, Chris, I could not call up a guy I don't even know. Sure you can. I'm telling you. You wait around for some jerk to ask you out, you're gonna end up going out with some jerk. - Hiya. - Hi. - How's it going? - Awful. That guy's lawyer's playing games, you know. Try and confuse the issue. Making me feel like I'm the one on trial. Oh, Lord. Elizabeth, I got a big mouth. I'm sorry. Mary Beth, it's okay, really. - Coffee, Mary Beth. - No, it's just over dramatizing. - So, you blew the case, huh? - No. No, it's just the kid D.A. put me up without letting me warm up so I got a little rattled. I was fine. It's all right. Miss Carter, can I talk with you for a moment? - Are you ready for me? - Soon. - I just want to set something up with you. - Oh. Excuse me. How is she holding up? She's all right as long as we don't talk about the trial. All right. So far we've gone through cars, clothes, men and movies. I'm running out of subjects. You have any suggestions? - Kind of... - No! - What is going on? - No. No. I thought she knew. - What is it? - Knew what? I've gotta get back to court. Can you handle her? What is it that she was supposed to know? The appellate court has overturned another one of the convictions. - Oh, God. - His new trial is set for next month. ELIZABETH: I won't. - I can't. - I know it's upsetting. - I cannot do this anymore. - All right, Elizabeth. It's just one more trial. Maybe it is just one more trial for you. But I can't sleep. I can't think. I can't do this anymore. And you... - You are not going to make me. - Listen to me. Can we talk about it? - No, Mary Beth. I am so sorry. - Please, just wait a minute. - I am really truly sorry. - Elizabeth, wait a minute. - Let's talk. Let us help you here. - No. Officer Lacey, court's back in session. District Attorney's waiting for you. I'll get her. You cannot blow this homicide collar. I'll take care of Elizabeth. - Elizabeth! - All right. If your partner doesn't bring her back, I'm gonna have to issue a bench warrant. You would arrest her after what she's been through? I need her as a witness. Well, aren't you all heart. I'm coming. Hi. - I didn't know you smoked. - I haven't for five... Please. Don't lecture me. At least now you can buy your car. Just come back upstairs with me, please. It isn't fair. - It just is not fair. - No, it isn't. But nobody ever said life was fair. - So then what's the point of it? - The point of it is that it's still good. If you'd stop being a victim. Wait a minute, Elizabeth. Wait a minute! Stop being a victim? I am a victim. - Four men raped me. - I know it. And until you stop running away from the consequences of that you're gonna stay a victim. Until you go up there and you face him down again in court, you're gonna stay a victim. I have faced that scum in court over and over and over and over again! What the hell do you want me to do? You're asking me as a cop? 'Cause as a cop, I want you to go up there and face him again till it sticks! If you're asking me as your friend, as your friend, I want you to go up there and face him again. No. No. When did you first become aware of Mr. Kamal's presence in the house? As soon as he come in. No, before. You can smell a Turk downwind at two miles. Make that three, and I swear it under oath. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Objection. Objection. Objection. The witness will be admonished. Just answer the questions. No politics. - This is outrageous. - Continue, Counselor. Now, then. Will you describe Mr. Kamal's appearance on the night in question? Just like now. Greasy. So greasy, his hair was shining in the dark like patent leather shoes. Your Honor! Your Honor, please! Please! Could you admonish the witness again? The witness is admonished a second time. Go on, gentlemen, please. Mr. Menukian, you said his hair was shining in the dark. What do you mean by "in the dark"? What do you think I mean? Dark. - No light. - "No light," what do you mean by that? - Sure. - Sure. Music goes on, lights go out, 50 people have a good time. You don't know nothing about hanky-panky? Don't look like you do. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) How can you be so sure of what you saw if it was so dark? How? How? No problem. If I say I can see, I can see. - That's right. - What? You think you don't pay any attention when three guys get stabbed? Mr. Menukian, did you ever have your eyes examined? Close the door. In the dark? Three stabbings? Why wasn't I made aware of these little problems before they cropped up on the witness stand? Or don't they teach you how to interview witnesses? They do, sir. And I did. I specifically asked Mr. Menukian about the lighting. He said it was good. He also said nobody else got hurt. I have it here in my report. He's changing his story, sir. Well, we're just lucky that old Morley Pressman is such a bozo. He scored maybe one point on the lights, but missed the significance of the other knifings completely. As long as there are no other surprises, I can still pull this one out. You're gonna try and convict the guy for murdering somebody in the dark? I mean, three people got knifed in what sounds to me like a free-for-all. - Armenians against the Turks. - Listen, Detective. There are six witnesses willing to swear in court that he did it. Now don't tell me how to do my job. And we'll just let the jury do their job. Now, if you'll just ask Mr. Menukian and his clan to come back in here for a moment before we go back into court, I'll try and make sure that we keep the damage to a minimum. Yes, sir. Mr. Leffler, whatever happened to the search for truth and justice you were instructing the judge about before? I mean, I know there's a lot of Armenians that don't hold with that historical grudge they got against the Turks. But this one family, sir, I think they're trying to railroad the guy. Thank you for your theory, Detective Lacey, but it's my case now. Just ask them to come in. All right? All right. Maybe enough is enough. What's gonna happen when they turn over the other two? I'll be here to put them right back in. But, I cannot do that without Elizabeth Carter. As far as I am concerned, that woman has been raped twice. Once by those creeps and once by the courts. - And now you're gonna do it again? - That's an old argument, Officer. - Well, forgive me. - We are doing the best we can. If she is not back when I need her I will ask for a recess and issue a bench warrant. She will spend tonight in jail. But she will take that stand in the morning. - So, shall we go over to her apartment? - I just called her. She's not there. I'll tell you what. I will pitch the D.A. again. I'll ask her to hold the warrant. You and I can go pick up Elizabeth. - She can spend the night in my apartment. - Good. So, what's going on with our murder trial? That's a good idea. You think the D.A. will go for it? I don't know. I'm gonna try. So, what's happening on your end? What are we gonna do about your car? - Mary Beth, you're being evasive. - Me? Did you go do something to screw up our collar? Oh, thank you very much. I appreciate that vote of confidence. - Well, did you? - I can't hear you. LEFFLER: Now, on that date in question, Miss Burnham. You were the night-duty nurse in the emergency room, right? WOMAN: Yes, I was. And did you have occasion to see Mr. Rapozian on that evening? Yes, several members of his family brought him in for treatment. - About what time was that? - Could I look at my notes? Objection. It hasn't been established that the witness doesn't have an independent memory. For Pete's sakes, Pressman, are we gonna start all that again? The District Attorney is admonished to refrain from outbursts of this sort. JUDGE: Do you have any independent memory without your notes? WOMAN: Yes, I think it was about 1:00 a.m. No, that's not right. It was the defendant who came in with a stab wound in his arm about 1:00. Mr. Rapozian came in about a half an hour after that. Your Honor, the people would ask for a recess at this time. This court stands recessed for 20 minutes. I want you to know, Leffler, I appreciate everything you've done. I'll see you back in the courtroom. I know you done the right thing. - Thank you. - Okay. - Did you dismiss the case? - What are you talking about? The nurse's testimony. She said the defendant was treated for stab wounds - a half hour before the victim. - She did? I didn't hear that. Mr. Leffler, would you agree with me that it's kind of hard to murder someone when you're in the emergency hospital? At the least, it's self-defense. At the worst, it looks like the family's railroading the guy. Maybe Rapozian got lost on the way to the hospital. Maybe the nurse was wrong. Maybe a million things. Who knows, or cares? The point is, his lawyer didn't catch it either. And now he's offering to make a deal. He'll plead to second degree. What a bozo. - Well, you can't let him do that Mr. Leffler. - Of course I can. The defendant shouldn't suffer because his lawyer is a bozo. Come on. You've seen Kamal's rap-sheet. He's as dirty as they come. If he didn't do this one he did something else. Let's just be happy we can get him off the street for a few years. I'm not gonna be happy if I don't think he's guilty. So don't be happy. Just be a cop. I'm sorry, sir, but three stabbings in the dark in a 50-man free-for-all with the defendant in the hospital a half hour before the victim, I know I didn't go to law school, but that sounds a lot like reasonable doubt to me. Officer, you and I are supposed to be on the same team. With respect, sir, I don't think that this is supposed to be a team sport. Are you threatening me? Well, yes, sir. I guess I am. And if I don't get satisfaction through the proper channels I got an old friend at The Times who would, I am sure, be very interested in hearing this story. I can't believe this. You're actually willing to let this sleazoid just skate out of here? That's how unhappy I am with this particular beef, sir. Unless you wanna work out something else. Something a little more fair. GALLEGOS: And the people will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that on the date in question Elizabeth Carter had the bad fortune to be waiting for a cab outside her place of business - at 33rd and First Avenue. - (WHISPERS) Christine. And at that time the defendant, Sordell, and three other men approached her brandished a knife and threatening her life... How're we doing? - She never took a recess. - What? The opening arguments are almost done and they're gonna be getting to Elizabeth any time now. I just tried her apartment again. She's still not home. So, I guess we did what we could, huh? - How's the murder, recessed? - It's done. It's over. - Really? Did we nail him? - He copped a plea. That's what I was afraid of, manslaughter, right? Possession of a switchblade. Possession of a switchblade? Are you serious? Mary Beth! You're not being serious. You're joking with me, you're... What? - Hi. - LACEY: Hiya. You okay? I'm kind of worn-out feeling sorry for myself. You were right, Chris. And I am not gonna be a victim anymore. I'm glad. Look, I don't know if I can do the next one. But I can do this one. - So, we do them one at a time. - Yeah, one at a time. The three musketeers, huh? - How do you do it? - All right. Come on, we'll go over with you. No, thank you, but I have to do this myself. If I lean on you two anymore I might fall flat on my face and never get up. I really have to do this myself. You understand? I really think you're a terrific lady. So are you. Both of you. - You call us, huh? - I will. You're here? Good. We're just about ready for you. And I'm just about ready for you. I love you guys. - I really do. - Okay. - Yeah. - Go. Wanna get a car? - Who's buying? - Me. Come on. CAGNEY: What kind of moronic D.A. would let him cop to possession of a lousy switchblade? It wasn't his idea. It was my idea. Now you're really kidding me, right? It was the right thing to do, Christine. Oh, Mary Beth. What, are you taking bribes from the ACLU? You just passed your car. Hold on. (TIRES SCREECHING) Hey, my car. (LAUGHS) Listen, I told you 5:30, sweetheart. His money is just as green as yours. Isn't that a shame? (LAUGHING) What? I was gonna buy this? LA CEY: That's... What a pity.
