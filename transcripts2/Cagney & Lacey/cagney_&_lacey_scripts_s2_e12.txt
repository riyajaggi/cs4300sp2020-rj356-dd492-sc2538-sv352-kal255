 Please, I'll swoon. It's a current warrant, Christine. The man has to be arrested. You have to know Grand. You have to start feeling the way he thinks. - Oh, and you do? - I do. You people talk about Albert Grand like he was some kind of movie star. The man is a thief. Mr. Albert Grand is gonna know you've been here. He's world-class, Mary Beth. So the one who catches him is also world-class?

 (DOG WHINING) Come on, Ralphie. It's dumb. I don't know how to tell jokes, and I don't want to know how to tell jokes. It is not dumb. Listen. How many New Yorkers does it take to screw in a light bulb? - You're really gonna push this, aren't you? - Come on. I give up. How many? So, what's it worth to you? Come on, it was a riot. Well, I'm sure it was funny when you heard it. How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb? There is nothing worse than early-morning shift. So I'm trying to liven it up. You tell me a joke. I'll tell you a joke. - I don't know any jokes. - I'm teaching you jokes.

 How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb? - How many? - Four. One to screw in the bulb and three to be supportive. (FEIGNS LAUGHTER) WOMAN ON RADIO: Any unit, 10-52, the Dunhill Hotel. Disturbance in progress. - You wanna take that? - Yeah. You can joke him into jail. Almost funny. Car 11 responding to last. Stop, please! He's got my baby! Stop him! He's got my baby! (MAN EXCLAIMING) (TIRES SCREECHING) You creep. You cretin! I'll make you pay for this. Oh, please don't do that. - Not in front of the baby! - Break it up. It's the cops. Now ease down, huh? That creep, he stole my baby! If it wasn't for the gentleman... - He's my kid, too, you flake. - Yeah? Well, the court gave me custody! All right, that's enough! Enough. Is everybody all right? You okay, baby? (RAZZING) If it wasn't for this gentleman, God only knows what would happen. - He saved my child. - He's my child, too, damn it! All right. Come on. The court didn't figure you'd skip to New York. Look. I come from Pennsylvania, okay? How do I visit my boy on weekends when she moves to New York? Serves you right. That is all the discussion we are gonna have here in front of this kid. Come on. We're gonna run this down to the station. We'll decide what we're doing there. - Thank you very much, sir. Come on, baby. - You go with them. Go ahead. (SCREAMS) - Naughty boy. - Feisty, isn't he? He's lost his manners, I'm afraid. But I haven't. Kyle Berryman, your servant and your admirer. Christine Cagney, Detective, 14th Precinct. - No. - (LAUGHING) Yes. That was a very brave thing you did tonight. Most people don't want to get involved. Well, I didn't mean to get involved. I brought my dog here at this hour. I just did what old fools are best at. I got in the way and nothing more heroic than that. No, don't disillusion me, Mr. Berryman. Heroes are too scarce today. I think I found one. So, you're really a detective? Mmm-hmm. And I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to come down to the Precinct house with us and make a statement. It's a bit late and I'm a bit old. Must I? - You're a witness. - Oh, dear. I'm sorry. It will take a couple of hours. I'm afraid that's the price of goodwill around here. But I'd be happy to give you a ride home afterwards. You live nearby? (DOG WHINING) I'm living at the Dunhill Hotel now. Great, then there's no problem. Come on. Well, something tells me that you're very, very good at what you do, something that has nothing to do with your quite obvious beauty. (LAUGHING) You're a pistol, aren't you? Well, at my age, one doesn't have much time to waste. One doesn't have much of anything to waste. You like it? You're not going to wear it without earrings. No, I was thinking of it for Julie. - Those look like awfully good stones. - It's worth over 30 grand. The Robbery Squad just called. Is that the evidence? Yeah. Uniform found it in an abandoned car over near the park. And they turned it in to us? Yeah, they figured it relates to the Waldorf robbery last month. Drop it in here. Julie's going to be heartbroken. She deliberately took the boy out of state so I wouldn't see my son again. So I did something. Big deal. I'm human. Yeah, listen. He didn't give a damn about the child before the divorce. Now look at him. He's all father love. I already had to file a warrant for non-support. - You wouldn't dare! - I did. All right, we are in a police station now. We are all of us gonna keep a civil tongue in our head. Now I will check on any outstanding warrants. If there's one on Mr. Tartaglia, then we will take appropriate action. You, what the hell do you know about love? And what do you know about love? - Don't start. I'm warning you. - The end. The end. You stay put. Mrs. Tartaglia, will you step this way, please? Right over here. - Are you all right? - Oh, yes. I was thinking of my own wife. But that was many years ago. - She's dead. - I'm sorry. You give me one more minute, and then you're free to go. And lose your company? Type very slowly, my dear. - Mr. Berryman? - Yes. I heard what happened last night. We're all very proud of you. It was a really nice thing you did. It's a safe bet the Lieutenant's gonna put you up for a civilian commendation. We could even send your name in to the Daily News. If you win their Crime Fighters award, that's 1,000 bucks in your pocket. Well, I appreciate your thanks, I really do, but I don't want any awards or any money. I simply did my civic duty. That's enough. If we are finished... Sign and we're finished. - Thank you. Where? - Right there. - Then we're finished. - Thank you. To fate. Without it we'd have never met. Please, I'll swoon. Let's go home, Ralphie. - Bye. - Au revoir. - So, all that homework done, young man? - I got an A in math. That's very good, but I think you're evading my question. - No, he hit the books. I saw him. - Yeah, comic books. - Hey, you gonna be able to sleep? - Yeah. I don't have to be back till 4:00. It's almost 8:00 now, so how many hours does that give me? Quick. - Eight. - Perfect. Crazy night shift's really got to take it out of you, huh? Yeah. But I'm on straight days tomorrow. - Your back bothering you again? - No. Why? - 8:00? We're late. - We're late. - Kisses here. Come on, kisses. - All right, I gotta run. - Careful on those streets. - I will. - All right, you, take care of your brother. - Okay. - Bye. - All right, take it easy, guys. MICHAEL: All right. Bye. HARVEY JR.: Goodbye. You remember Sandra Larkenstein? She's in town. I got a call last night. - No kidding. - Oh, yeah. - They still in Pennsylvania? - I think so. (LAUGHS) What's the matter? Honey, I don't care if your old girlfriend calls you, as long as you don't care. Hey, I don't care. Hey, what, are you kidding? Look, she's in town for a few days and I got a call, you know. She was wondering if we could go to lunch. So I said I would take her. - What do you think? - Tell her hi for me. You don't mind? Honey, you love me. Good night. - LACEY: How can you eat that? - I love it. Are you handling the warrant - on the guy you brought in last night? - Yeah. Lieutenant wanted me to remind you two to get on it. Well, we got to find it first. - Sushi? - Yeah. May I have a piece of your eel, please? - Sure. - LACEY: Eel? I used to eat this stuff by the ton until I found out about all the mercury in it. See? I hate family disputes. Anything about love, people go crazy. Punching and screaming are just some of the ways people work out their problems, Christine. - Would you look at this? - What? It's an outstanding warrant for Kyle Berryman. - For what? - Nonpayment of alimony, it's right there. - He told me his wife had died. - Wishful thinking? No, that's... It's a current warrant, Christine. The man has to be arrested. Come on, Mary Beth, forget it. The guy goes out of his way to do a good deed and that's the payoff? Come on. Let's go. Come on. No. I'm not gonna do it. Chris, on your right. I really hate this a lot. Mr. Berryman. Good evening, ladies. You're under arrest. MAN: 14th Precinct. Good morning. What's going on? Petrie and I had a riot in a disco last night. This is the last bunch. We've been backlogging uniforms since 3:00 a.m. Sorry we missed it. You girls were probably home asleep having sweet dreams. Sure. You're gorgeous. Wait a minute. - Mr. Berryman? Wait. - Good morning. I hope you didn't spend all night in there, sir. When we left, they were gonna cycle you through Central Booking. Well, apparently there was a disturbance at some disco. Oh, I'm sorry. Hiya, Ralph. Come on, come on. Did you get any sleep? I rested my eyes. I'm not used to places like this. Why don't you let me see what I can do with our Lieutenant, sir, to get you out of here? - You want a donut? - Thank you. - How about some coffee? - No, thank you. Hey, sign me in, will you, Mary Beth? - LACEY: Yeah. - You like it here? Most of the time. I like my work. You love your work. You're very good at it. How do you know? - Yes, I am. - Perhaps even better than that. - Thank you. Sit down, Mr. Berryman. - Here, Ralph. Look, why don't we call your wife and have her come down here? Maybe if you talk to her she'll drop the charges, huh? No, she's quite adamant. I'll be all right. The only thing I worry about is Ralph. Well, don't you know someone who can take care of him? Well, perhaps my nephew. I tried to reach him but he travels. I really don't know what I'm going to do. I'm sure we can work something out. Right, Ralph? (DOG BARKS) No, I told you, no. Haven't your kids always wanted to have a dog? They had a dog, twice. I'm not going through that again. - What happened? - They were run over. Both of them? Well, that's what dogs do. And the "he went to live on a farm" story is not gonna work anymore. I cannot take on this kind of responsibility. Yeah, what about me? You're used to it. - You got yourself a pet, my friend. - WOMAN ON RADIO: All units, we have a 10-10, possible assault or homicide in progress, 623 East 29rd Street. That's two blocks from here. - Swell. - Car 11 responding. Take it easy, huh? (SIREN BLARING) - You gotta crack the window open. - What for? - He'll suffocate. - Oh, mister, get out of the way. Suffocate? I don't want this car stolen again, especially with him in it. Well, he's your dog. - Oh, I can't take this responsibility. - Stay. Ralph. Heel. LACEY: All right, police, folks. Who here called in a homicide? I didn't say homicide. I just said they were killing each other. Thank you very much, ma'am. Will you please step inside? - Let me know what happens. - MAN: Get out of here. Thank you, ma'am. You wanna open the door, please? Good morning. - Police. Detectives Cagney... - Lacey. Hello. May I help you? Hey, you can't just come in like that. - Who else is in here? - No one. - We heard voices. - TV. My brother and I were watching TV, but it broke. Yeah? Where is he? - Who? - Your brother. - Oh, my brother, he's... - What's in here? The bathroom. My brother, he's in the bathroom. All right, stand over there. Right there. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Police, open up. Look, we were just having a little family quarrel. - Open up or I'm coming in. - Please, he's very shy. LACEY: Shut up. Chester, I was just telling them about our little tiff. Yeah. You wanna move away from the door, please? - It's occupied. - Move. On the wall, right here. - Right there. - There's no need, really. Really. Families, you know how they are. He forgot to send Mother a birthday card. Kid drives me crazy. You two want to get down on the floor? Now! Take a look. Expecting trouble? They're cataloging the stuff now. About half of it they were able to ID right on the spot. We'll warehouse all of it. Anything on how he got the police scanners? Christmas presents, that's what our fence is saying. Mr. Rosen, like to tell us why you were trying to rob a fence? I didn't know he was a fence, and I wasn't trying to rob him. CAGNEY: Great. Anything from records yet? SAMUELS: Yeah. On their way. Excuse me, Miss Cagney. I thought you'd have been released by now. - I'm interrupting. - You didn't interrupt anything. This is a ridiculous charade. I'm sure your charade is more important than mine at the moment. I'll wait. No, no, no. Look, I'm very sorry. Let me talk to my Lieutenant about this, because this is absurd. No, no, no. I've just been released. I was finally able to reach my nephew. - He brought the bail. - Oh, good. All right. Okay. I don't want to take up any more of your time. Where's Ralph? Oh, I'm sorry. I dropped him off at my loft. I'm gonna be here awhile. - Is this something major? - No, some punk tried to rob a fence. Oh, good Lord. I promise Ralph's all right. I left the TV on. - He loves that. - Oh, good. I'll be home around 8:00 or 8:30. - Do you want to come by tonight? - That's fine. Let me get you the address. Something the matter? I was merely thinking of timing, it's time. Oh, thank you. Goodbye, Miss Cagney. I'll see you tonight. Want some more coffee? We'll get you some more coffee here. No. No, no, no, not another one, please. - I've got to be at Macy's soon. - Sister? - Joyce. - Yeah, I remembered her name. What did her husband do? He was, oh, a dentist, right? - Harvey. - What? It's really been nice seeing you again. And, well, let's do try and keep in touch. - Nineteen was a good age, wasn't it? - Yes. I've got to go. Now, you be sure and tell Mary Beth and the boys hello for me, all right? Say, how much longer are you gonna be in town? Well, until Thursday. Maybe we could get together again for something to eat, to drink... You know, just to fill up the holes, whatever you want. - Well, I... - Here, this is where I'm working. Give me a call, huh? We'll set something up. Whatever you want. Okay, Harvey. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, God. Ever hear of a guy named Albert Grand? No. Boy, I remember the name. My dad used to talk about him all the time. - A very, very big hotshot thief. - So? So, he's in Rosen's file. He and Grand were in prison together. Rosen worked in the library, Grand ran it. He even wrote Rosen a letter of recommendation for parole. I guess they were pretty close. So you think that he and Grand still have some connection? No, Grand retired years ago. No, no, no. We're not talking about the nickel-and-dime guys you get today. Compared to Grand, Brink's was nickel-and-dime. - See? That big. - Style. Do you know style? - Yeah, I know style. - No, no, you don't know. You can't know. It's not your fault. It's a whole other world, my dear. Here, do yourself a favor. Is that Grand's book? No, it's Classic Criminals. There's a whole chapter on that Albert Grand. - Let me see it. - LA GUARDIA: His specialty was hotels. Here's a photograph. "Albert Grand, the one that got away." SAMUELS: Oh, that's Grand. The only way they could lock him up was on some other trumped up charges, taxes. That's right. - I don't believe it. - What? No, it can't be. It just can't be. March 5th, 1974, he was released, served his whole sentence. And Grand and Rosen met again right here today and he never let on. - Face to face, he never even blinked. - Bring him in. - For what? - The Waldorf robbery. It's beginning to sound like his M.O. I'm supposed to meet him in 20 minutes at my apartment to pick up his dog. - What're you standing here for? Get him. - Yes, sir. - That's weird. - What? I left the TV set on. Ralph! Ralph! What? "Thank you." He left a $20 orchid in a glass of water? No, he put it in one of the crystal vases I keep on the bookcase. You really think the Waldorf Hotel robbery was Albert Grand? Sure fits his M.O. Nonviolent, very sophisticated tools. He uses his own men as doormen and desk clerks, ties the rest of them up. So if they got away with $400,000 the last three weeks, then why would Grand risk another job now? The thrill of it. He wrote a book while he was in prison. I took it out of the library. Yeah, if I recall, it was lousy. Yeah. Wouldn't that be something if Albert Grand was back in action again, huh, after all these years? I think that's exactly what he's gonna do, something daring and very intricate. And something very embarrassing to the Department, you wait. You people talk about Albert Grand like he was some kind of movie star. The man is a thief. (PHONE RINGS) Detective Lacey, 14th. Yes, sir, just a minute. Christine, it's him. It's Berryman, Albert Grand on four. Detective Cagney. GRAND: Hello. I'm so gla d I caught you. So am I. I wanted to thank you for the wonderful care you took of my little doggy. Somebody try and trace his call. CAGNEY: You already have, more than enough. I also wanted to apologize in case I disturbed anything in your home. You see, it seemed more expedient just to go ahead and take the dog. How'd you get through all of my locks? You left them open, my dear. I never leave them open. Detective Lacey, shield 360, I need to trace a call... Drag it on. Come on. - Mr. Berryman... - LACEY: Yes, ma'am. I so enjoyed meeting you, I hope you don't think I'm being forward, but is there a chance of our meeting again? I don't know, maybe have a drink, or take a walk in the park or talk... A walk in the park? Unfortunately, I'm leaving town very soon, otherwise it would've been my pleasure. And in any case I wanted to say goodbye, dear Miss Cagney. I suppose the cat is out of the bag now, isn't it? Yeah, you are quick. We are trying to keep him on the line, ma'am. Yeah, we found your picture in the squad room. But, Mr. Berryman, I really... Mr. Grand. I really meant what I said about wanting to meet you again. I've heard of you for many, many years. I even have a copy of your book. - Perhaps if we meet again I'll autograph it. - Would you? We've been on the phone now for approximately one minute and 15 seconds. You need at least three minutes for a trace. (PHONE CLICKING) Thank you very much. Never mind. LACEY: Not enough time. - Oh, God, he's smooth. - Yeah, you're trying too hard. Sir, may I suggest we call the Robbery Squad in on this? They have more expertise. - No! - No! No. I want us to crack this one on our own. Fine. No problem. I'm gonna do some research. Lacey, Lacey, I think I know a guy who can be helpful to us here. Nathan Bardo, information broker. - Stoolie. - Give him my regards. So, what, is he in the book? We're sitting and we're talking, now what more do you want? I know that Lieutenant Samuels would appreciate your cooperation, sir. He is the reason I ain't thrown you out of here yet. That's what he is. Well... You don't exactly got the lay of the land. Bardo's off-limits to cops, that's the way it's been for 50 years. That's how I stay in business, little lady. I'm sure you're a very good businessman, Mr. Bardo. When was the last time you saw Albert Grand? Cotton Club, 40 years ago. We were hoping to ask him some questions about the Waldorf robbery. Is that so? We also suspect that there might be something else happening pretty soon. Mmm-hmm. He works with police scanners and acetylene torches now. You got any word on the street for something like that the past few days? - Yeah. I've heard something. - Oh, you did? - So, he is gonna do something. - Yes. Why did you tell me? Mr. Bert Samuels called and said to let you in here, so I let you in here. Mr. Bert Samuels call and says talk to you, so I talk to you. But Mr. Samuels don't own me. You tell Mr. Bert Samuels this is gonna cost him something. Yes, sir, I will do that. Mr. Albert Grand is gonna know you've been here. Yes, sir. You've used up your goodwill. Yes, sir. Hey, would you take this stuff? It is burning my hand. Please. You love this junk, don't you? When I was a kid I did. Now I've got to watch my figure. Hey, half the guys on the street are watching your figure. You... Harvey. Don't you have to get back to work soon? You're gonna get in trouble. Hey, that's what's great about being your own boss. What am I gonna do, fire myself? You've done all right, haven't you? Been a lot of years, Sandra. I take one look at you, it's all here again. - Harvey. - What? - Well, I don't know how to say this. - Come on. Say what you want to say. I want to make love to you. I can't. Forget it. I'm sorry. Just forget I said it. - Hey. Whoa, whoa, wait. Whoa. - I've known Mary Beth for years. Look, it's all right. I just wouldn't know where to begin. I just can't. - Okay? - I understand. I've got a husband and you've got a wife. Sure. That's it. She's my wife. Sandra. Hey. I can't because I want to. I've been thinking about you. I can't. It must be a pretty good book, huh? It must be a terrific book. You've been reading that book three solid hours. Do you know that Albert Grand would case a hotel for six months? He'd rehearse three or four times before actually hitting it just to make sure his timing was right. No kidding. Aren't you a little overenthusiastic about this, Christine? Did it occur to you that we met him in front of the Dunhill? He's a fascinating man. Oh, good, maybe he'll invite you to dinner. It's weird. I feel like I know him. Yeah? Where were you two gonna hit next? I'll let you know when I find out. Good night. Night. Excuse me. Oh, excuse me. I thought you were somebody else. (CAR HORN HONKING) WOMAN ON RADIO: Detective Car 1 1. Car 11. New Jersey state police confirm a stolen vehicle. Alport Cleaners Laundry truck, license number XGN-791, reported missing from Alport Cleaners garage last Tuesda y night. 10-4, this car will proceed. Car 11 requests backup at this location. 10-4, backup on the wa y. MAN: Ready? Police! Stop what you're doing. - What's the problem? - No problem. Just up against the wall. Up against the wall. Turn around. You, around! (GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) (TIRES SCREECHING) MAN: Let's get out of here. You're lucky you weren't killed. Yeah, he could've killed me if he wanted to, but he didn't. What the hell were you doing out there anyway? - Because that's where we first met Grand. - So what? So, I can't explain it, okay? It's just... You have to know Grand. You have to start feeling the way he thinks. - Oh, and you do? - I do. All right. All right. I'll buy what you're saying. You saw the police walkie-talkies, all that stuff fits Grand's M.O. But now, now he's underground and that's where he's gonna stay, because this was too close a call. I don't think so. - You don't think so? - No, I don't. Come on, you gotta be kidding. The man came this close to being burnt. And maybe what I tripped on was only a rehearsal. Well, even if it was, Grand's not gonna go through with the robbery now that he knows you got the Dunhill marked. He's not gonna back off. You're really committed to this, aren't you? You bet I am, and I want to do something about it. Well. Well, we could open the door on his pal, Rosen. That might give us a lead if anything's happening. - Cagney. - Yes, sir. Don't go walking around the streets by yourself at night. It's not smart. - Yes, sir. - Cagney. Yes, sir. Don't be impatient with me. That's not smart, either. Yes, sir. You beat this Albert Grand, there's a promotion in it for you. - Heard Chris had a close one last night. - Yeah. Guess you two are really after this Grand character. One of us is. Petrie. Petrie, I got something for you. - PETRIE: I can't believe you're eating that. - It's protein. I've been saving it since this morning. This guy must hold the record. That's the longest shoe shine in history. (EXCLAIMING) He's making his move. There he goes. I'm never gonna be able to finish this. I don't believe it. We lost him. There. Come on. - Get the button! - Got it. CAGNEY: How could you possibly follow the wrong guy out of an elevator? Look, I don't want to hear it, okay? If Samuels wants to bust my chops, that's one thing. Nobody is busting anybody's chops. But you don't have the right. - Like hell! - Cagney! In here. Proper channels, you satisfied? - Hey, you don't talk to me like that. - We blew it. You will never, never publicly call one of my people incompetent again, do you understand that? - I do. I overreacted. - Yes, you did. Petrie is one of the best, most intuitive cops I ever worked with. And Isbecki, Isbecki is solid. I'm sure there were extenuating circumstances to their losing the tail. Yeah, well, I'm sure that's very gracious of you. You know what I think? I think you're miffed because your little theory was shot all to hell. - I don't see any reason... - I think you had the Dunhill on the brain, and then suddenly Rosen veered to a totally different hotel. Grand is that good, Cagney. That's why he is who he is. Beat it. These guys, these guys on TV, they kill me. (SHUSHING) I mean, they make a million bucks. This stuff's got nothing to do with reality. If it had anything to do with my reality, I wouldn't watch it. I didn't think your reality was all that bad. Parts of my reality are terrific. Hey, I'm sorry. I just had a bad day. - You wouldn't believe how lousy... - Look, look. Look at that water. - Mary Beth... - Here come the guns. Those guys draw their guns more in one show than I do in a year. Mary Beth. - What? - I love you. I love you. I miss something? I just wanted you to know. I know. (SIGHS) Look at that. Tough being left out of things, isn't it? - It's her thing. - This is just one race she's running alone. Would you get out of here? - Mary Beth. - Yeah! It's tough being left out of things. You've got Park Crest written 300 times on that piece of paper. I know. I don't know why I'm doing this. Mary Beth, I didn't get to bed till 4:00 this morning. I can't stop thinking about him. Christine, what you are doing here is not normal. This man is all you think about. Now, you want work, we got work here. He's in your thoughts all the time, and you don't know for sure who or what he is. But I feel like I know him better than I know my own father. You need a head doctor, Christine. Maybe I do. He's world-class, Mary Beth. Think about that. World-class. So the one who catches him is also world-class? (PHONE RINGING) Detective Lacey, 14th. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Were there any witnesses as far as you know? Yes, sir. If uniforms aren't there within 10 minutes you call me back, all right? Detective Lacey. Yes, sir. Thank you. Christine, a laundry truck was just stolen, the corner of 32nd and 5th. - So what? - An Alport Cleaners truck. Wasn't Albert Grand in an Alport Cleaners truck in front of the Dunhill? Huh? - He did that to throw us off. - Throw us off, how? Because the Alport Cleaners doesn't service the Dunhill Hotel. It services the Park Crest. How do you know that? Because I called yesterday and found out. He's gonna do it. He's gonna hit the Park Crest. - Come on. - I'm coming. The man is calling me back in 10 minutes! You make me crazy when you drive like this, Christine. Could we just get there? He's good. God, how he's good. All that jive about the Dunhill. Pull back! We're getting him, Mary Beth. I'm getting Albert Grand. WOMAN ON RADIO: All units in the vicinity of the Park Crest Hotel, possible 10-30 in progress. Repeat. Possible 10-30. What units are responding? Take the call, Mary Beth. Tell them we have it. Christine says, "We have it." (SIREN SOUNDING) (WHIRRING) - Police, sir. You all right? - Where are they? Everything is in order. You don't mind if I look in your vault room, do you? - Come on! - This way. - Christine. - What? Chris, that's Rosen. It's a ruse. He faked me out. He's hitting the Dunhill. One-eighty! (SIRENS BLARING) Hey, come on! You the manager? - Hey! - Yeah. Police. We think you're being robbed. Really? We haven't had any reports. Come on, man, we don't have all night. - Where are your safe deposit boxes? - In the vaults on the second floor. - Well, come on! Take us there. Go! - Right, right. Timing. This hotel has a security system that cost $1.2 million. CAGNEY: Well, you should've spent more. Hold up. Hey, hey! Be cool. Be cool. - Can you smell it? - Oil? No. It's coolant. MANAGER: Where do you people get your information? Just stand back, sir. Putting out an APB. We can cordon the area. - Christine. - What? It's over! You gave it your best shot. Now let's see what's missing. Don't touch anything. Don't touch it, sir. GRAND: Hello, Christine. I'm going now. I hope this message is some small consolation. You see, no one ever came closer. No one. Damn it. (TAPE REWINDING) ... some small consolation. You see, no one ever came closer. No one. (TAPE REWINDING) Hello, Christine.
