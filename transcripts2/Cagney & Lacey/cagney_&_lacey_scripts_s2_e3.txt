 NARRA TOR: Next on Cagney & Lacey. Considering the crime here, it was felt that the leaders of the task force should be a couple of women. I'm talking gold stars. We've gotta start lining this thing up. What if we blow it? You people are being robbed. Couple of clowns dressed in uniform buzzed their way in. They ID'd themselves as cops, then ripped the place off. (TIRES SCREECHING) - Why you guys looking at me like that? - I think we've just been promoted.

 She thinks she's the damn chief of detectives. I can't breathe. (DOORBELL BUZZES) - Hello, Mrs. Matthews. - Sorry I'm late. - Oh, that's quite all right. - Is he ready for me? - He's waiting for you. - Good. Hello, Peter. Okay, let's get her washed. Okay? - I don't know if I am ready for this. - Oh, Elizabeth, it's going to be beautiful. I don't know, Ethel. I need all the help I can get. (LAUGHS) You're going to be a knockout, hon. (DOORBELL BUZZES) Hi, fellas. Is everything okay? You give me the key to the back door.

 Excuse me? Give him the key or I'll put your brains on a wall. Now. All right, quiet! I want quiet. Come on, enough with the blower! - This is the police. - You people are being robbed. I want the purses in the middle of the room right now. - No! - Anybody else want to get tough? Huh? Now, get those purses out here. All right, now I'm gonna pay each of you a visit. You hand me your jewelry, all of it. Come on, let's go. (GASPS) - It's too tight. - It's jade. I like it. I like you. Leave her alone, you filth. Ethel! Too much time, man, gotta go. Maybe next time, huh? Everybody on the floor, face down and count to 100. Anybody looks up early, I swear to God I'll be here. So, count! Count, come on. (GROANING) Ethel. Ethel, it's all right, darling. - They're gone. - Doctor. - Oh, my God. Help me. - It hurts. Somebody get a doctor. (CRYING) Somebody get a doctor. What did I tell you, huh? Right on time. Christine Cagney, Theresa Mallory. - Hi. - Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you. - Thank you. - I hear you're some kind of super cop. - Oh, well, really? - She's not that super. Go ahead. I understand congratulations are in order. (TAXI HORN HONKING) When's the big event? Well, would you believe a medium size event, and it's a month from Saturday. - Great. - Penn Station, right? - That's right. - All right. Let's hold this down for tonight. Penn Station. (TAXI CONTINUES HONKING) This is the first time I've ever been in a police car. - Is that the radio? - That's it. You guys talk on it every day? - We've got a shotgun under the seat. - We do not. - So it's in the trunk. - Will you stop? So, when are you coming back? I guess tomorrow. Time's running out. We still have to get our dresses. - Are you in the wedding party? - Matron of honor. We go way back, this kid and me. DISPA TCHER ON RADIO: 10-30, a vailable units, 10-30, a vailable units. Lexington and 61st. Terry, I'm very sorry, but we're gonna have to let you out. You're kidding. Was that for you on the radio, were they calling us? Yes, we have a little emergency here and we're gonna... I'm very sorry. Look, hey, there's a cab right over there. - 10-30, a vailable units... - Pull over. 10-30 a vailable units, Lexington and 61st. Hold on, pal! Hold up over there! I got it, I got it. Is there a murder? Is somebody being robbed? Call me when you get back in town. Let's go. (SIREN WAILING) Cagney, 14th. WOMAN: I don't care. I can't stay here, I've gotta get some air. - We just need a statement. - I just told you, it was two policemen... You got your nerve. Get away from me. - She gonna make it? - Heart attack. What's this stuff about police robbing this place? Couple of clowns dressed in uniform buzzed their way in. They ID'd themselves as cops, then ripped the place off. Bad guys, too. Pistol-whipped two of the customers. They've been sent on to the hospital for treatment. Could you please tell me where they took her? - Pardon me? - I want to know which hospital. Lee Memorial, ma'am. Scared. I let them in. I couldn't ignore the police. Petrie, how about you checking out uniform supply houses, theatrical costumers, those kind of places? - No sweat. - Cagney, gotta see you in my office. Close the door. I don't want the civilians to hear. We just got a call. Ethel Carter, the woman who had the heart attack, - she doesn't have much longer to live. - I'm sorry. Yeah. So, you're next on the list. I want you to get over there and pay our respects. Oh, no, I just sat mourning only last month. - What if I trade off with somebody? - No trade-offs. Victim's out there dying, someone from this precinct stands by to let the family know that we are doing our job. And it's your turn. You do this to make me suffer, don't you? I do this because I believe it should be done. Period. WOMAN ON PA: Pharmacist on call. Please go to CCU stat. - Pharmacist on call to CCU stat. - It's very kind of you to come. - Oh, Miss... - Jordan, but please call me Elizabeth. - That's right. How are you feeling? - A little shaky. - You're friends, are you? - Very much so. I don't think Ethel's going to be able to tell you very much today, though. Oh, no, that's all right. By the way, we should be contacting you in about two, three days to see if there's anything else that you might remember. Do you know, when you snip a patch off a jacket, how the material underneath looks new? There was something like that on their jacket. I noticed it when he... It was just... A just slightly darker spot. You mean like a patch that had been removed? Yes, yes. Exactly. - You think that might help? - Oh, Miss... Elizabeth. Yes, I promise it will. Thank you very much. I'll tell you what, why don't I have our art department contact you, (ALARM BEEPING) and possibly you could give them a description of what these guys looked... Oh, my God, Ethel. Really, I'm sure she'll be fine. The doctors here are just terrific. I can't believe this is happening. Oh, God. Ethel. ELIZABETH: Oh, Ethel. (CRYING) Ethel, dear God. Ethel. I hate waiting around for somebody to die. I had to sit there and watch some total stranger burst out sobbing right in front of me. Well, he can go next time because it's not my job. - Quiet down, will you? I can't hear... - Quiet down yourself. What are you so hot about? Listen, there's something about a robbery coming in here - but I can't hear... - So listen. Heads up. Call's coming from Central. Our beauty burglars just hit another salon on Madison Avenue. ISBECKI: And they were calling me so much, I had to get my number changed. Well, that'll teach you for going out with twins. Yeah, you develop a taste for some things, you know? Hey, you need some help? I guess he don't. This is Cagney. Yeah, let me talk to your department artist. Raul? What do you mean he's busy? I'm busy. - LACEY: Hey. - All right, have him call me back. (EXCLAIMS) What are these things? Our fall fashions? Two hundred and eighteen uniform supply catalogues. Who'd have thought there were this many security uniform supply houses in New York? Hey, I'd look pretty good in this, don't you think? Cagney, Lacey, my office. Help me out playing doctor. These your women? - Macey and... - Lacey, sir. Cagney, Inspector. These are the women. - Bert, they any good? - They're all right. - Gee, thanks. - Let's save the smart mouth. We got a real problem here, three robberies in three days. All inside very exclusive beauty parlors with very exclusive women inside. Very exclusive. Very exclusive means very connected, right? Young woman, all people are equal under the law. - I don't know if they're right. - We're right. - We're right. - What are we right for? We are forming a task force. Considering the crime here, it was felt that the leaders of the task force should be a couple of women. - Think you're up to it? - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. SAMUELS: That's all for now. I am ready. I feel like I have been waiting for this all my life. Task force leaders, Mary Beth. Well, I suppose it'll look good on the records. Good on the records? I'm talking gold stars. We've gotta start lining this thing up. What if we blow it? The artist called while you guys were in with Samuels. - What did he say? - He can't get a good composite. Everybody he's talked to stared at the uniforms thinking they were cops. Oh, come on, somebody must've seen something. Well, there was one lady, but she won't come in. - Who won't come in? - A woman named Jordan. I know her. I'll take care of it. Elizabeth, we really do need you to come down. That person was this close to me. I could feel his breath. I can't remember what he looked like. It really wouldn't do any good for me to talk to your artist. But you remembered the details about their uniforms. Maybe something else would come back to you. He wanted my ring. My grandmother gave it to me. It's on so tight, I can't get it off. - Maybe if I could, Ethel would still be alive. - You've got to stop that. None of this was your responsibility. You were a victim. It's funny. I can't get a ring off. I can't balance a checkbook, I can't pay the bills properly. I guess there are a lot of things I can't do. Since my husband left last year, I've been sort of fumbling along. I can't even manage to get out of the house now, you see? Well, I'm sure that it's just a temporary thing. It's really wonderful to talk to somebody who understands. - Oh, good, I'm glad. - Maybe... - Maybe we could have lunch sometime. - Yes, I'd like that very much. Just right now, I'm really going crazy on this case. Sure. Okay. Whenever. Thank you, Elizabeth. (ALL CHATTERING) CAGNEY: All right. Can you all settle down now, please? Now, we don't have many of you from Anti Crime. Those we do have are spreading over as many salons on the Upper East Side as possible. How about spreading me over a few salons? Because I don't think you can handle the action. - Give me a try, huh? - What, you think this is funny here? You think getting molested and scared out of your wits is funny? SAMUELS: All right. Just had another report, few minutes before this meeting started. - What, they hit another salon? - No. Two clowns pretending to be policemen pulled over a lady and molested her in her car. Still want to spread it over a few salons? Okay, so let's get on with this. Petrie, how's it looking for the uniform search? Have you seen the size of the stack of catalogues I'm going through? So, I take that to mean you have almost completed your assignment. Excellent. La Guardia, have you got any better composite sketches from that artist? We're in the ballpark. We brought in three victims from the latest robberies. - We're down to two likenesses. - When can we have them? They're in the back of the room. Pick them up on the way out. All right, A teamwork, La Guardia. Thank you. She thinks she's the damn chief of detectives. One more thing and then that's it. Mary Beth. We've drawn up a list of all the known jewelry fences. We're gonna need a couple of people to run these guys down. Applebaum and Miller, I guess. Well, maybe somebody... Applebaum and Miller would love to take care of the fences. All right, that's it. Hit the bricks. Everybody go. (CAGNEY CLAPS) - You think we did okay? - Let you know in a minute. - What do you think? - About what? Harvey's gonna love you spending those kind of bucks on candlesticks. What, you don't expect me to get her some kind of chintzy little nothing gift, do you? No, but you didn't have to buy her honest-to-God Irish Crystal. Hey, watch it! You make me break these, I'll put you into Attica! Write it off to the raise you're gonna get. Early promotion, Second Grade Detective. Trust me on this one. Yeah, you write it off. Harv and I have an orthodontist to support. Terry's not gonna forget who gave her that. Why? What's the matter with it? I think you're letting the lady get to you. You have been twitchy ever since she came here to get married. Nobody has a better friend than Terry. I care about her. So why are you so concerned about what she thinks? Aren't you concerned about what your friends think? Well, I'm not so concerned that I break out in hives after dropping $127.50 on a pair of candlesticks. DISPA TCHER ON RADIO: 10-34, possible assault in progress, Ma dison and 4 1st. - That's near us, take it, take it. - All right, but just go slow, huh? Watch out for my crystal, would you? (SIREN WAILING) (HORN HONKING) LACEY: Would you slow down? And when we stop, would you go easy? If they're broken, Chris, I swear to God, you're paying for them. (TIRES SCREECHING) - Police! Hold it! - MAN: Don't shoot, okay? You don't give us a reason to, okay? Now get over there. The position, come on, you know it. - Get this leg out here. - I'm with the Townsman Building. I found this one trying to break into one of our tenant's apartments. He's crazy. He was chasing me because I made fun of his suit. You can call the Townsman to verify. The apartment belonged to the Hendersons. Mrs. Henderson was robbed only yesterday at her beauty salon, of all places. - There was a robbery... - Christine, get a load of this. ID, credit card, two sets of keys. (PANTING) Why you guys looking at me like that? I think we've just been promoted. Detective Cagney. Sir. At ease, Isbecki. Christine, I gotta run. So, the black will work, huh? It'll be perfect. Honestly, white pearls, nice. It'll work. - It'll work, nice. Okay, see you later. - Bye. I've stationed our Anti Crime people in a dozen salons along Lexington Avenue between 51st and 22nd Street. - Good. - Thank you, sir. - You want to knock it off, Isbecki? - You want a friendly piece of advice? You know how I would've handled Applebaum and Miller? - Nope. - With kindness. Yeah? I would've said, "Please, could you help us out with this?" You know, a little honey goes a long way. - Not with Applebaum and Miller. - With me, with the guys. - Thanks for the advice. - No charge. Isbecki, if I embarrassed you at the meeting, I'm sorry. You didn't. What's the problem? I'll tell you what's the problem. The problem is high interest rates, that's the problem. You never heard of creative financing? BILL: I'm as creative as hell. Unfortunately my banker is not. (WOMAN LAUGHS) WOMAN: Well, it's not a good time to build now anyway. Sure there's nothing I can do? Sit and enjoy. That's what help is for. (WOMAN EXCLAIMS) Beautiful. Well, I've finally let my girl go. The children are all in college, and I've found I really do like to cook. Yeah? I used to like it, too. Hey, I got to hand it to you, Bill. You got a terrific place here. Well, I was thinking of subletting, actually. I'd like to spend some more time with Terry at our place in Connecticut. Harvey, don't get me wrong. I love New York. - But it's not a fit place to live anymore. - Listen. Expect a call. We've got to get the flowers and we still have to find our dresses. BILL: So, tell me what you're in, Harv. Construction. Oh. - Take your shoes off. I'll go get the kids. - I'll get the kids. You know, a good-looking dame like you, if you was to play your cards right you could get a doctor, a lawyer, anyone you want. What makes you think I don't already have what I want? Just letting you know. - I don't even know her anymore, Harvey. - It was a rough night. She was the first person that I ever knew who tweezed her eyebrows. We used to set each other's hair in those big pink rollers, you know, the kind you could put your arm through, and we would tape spit curls to our cheeks and we would sleep like that. Did you ever do that with your best friend? Can't say I did. I love you, Harv. (PHONE RINGING) - Hello. - Hi, it's me. I just ran two witnesses in to take a look at our boy. - Yeah? What do we got? - Nothing. The credit cards and the keys are from our robberies but not our collar. He isn't one of them. Apparently he bought the stuff off the street from some guy he'd never met before, and we can't trace him. - So, sweet dreams. - You, too. Can you believe that? It's empty. Well, maybe if we stand out here and kick it for a while, we won't have to go back in there. Would you stop being paranoid? We're doing adequate. What, are you two hiding? LACEY: No, sir. We're just getting something to eat. Why is this task force, which was authorized by the Deputy Inspector, not producing results? - Have you read the DD-5s? - I'm reading the DD-5s. Well, then you know the results. What I want to know is who the hell is pulling these robberies? LACEY: We don't know, sir. And if you want to know the truth, Lieutenant, we're breaking our backs here. I know that. But are you aware that a congressman's girlfriend was one of the victims? Is that what all this is about? You two are the task force leaders. If there's gonna be heat, it's gonna be on you two. And I'm gonna protect you any way I can because I think you're doing all right, so far. When the robbery occurred she was having her toes done. What does that mean? Means the congressman's spending about 35 bucks on her feet. Any movement on the street? Lots of apartment keys and credit cards being sold. But if there's any gems or jewelry out there, we can't find them. - What about your fences at pawn shops? - Negative. Nothing substantial. Hey, with the amount those guys have been hauling in, we'd know about it. Maybe they're trading out of state. I love it. Send me to Florida. My cousin's got a condo. Keep trying, will you? - Elizabeth Jordan called again and again. - Not now. I'm not so sure about this leadership business. - Can't take the pressure. - Eat something, you'll feel better. There's a souvlaki guy down on the corner. I'm gonna go. You wanna go? You kidding? I smell that stuff, I don't fit in the dress. Terry's got something all picked out. I gotta go meet her. Have fun. Her father was right. She should have eloped. - This is it, definitely. - LACEY: Oh, my God. - What's the matter? Did the pin stick you? - No, the price. Be still, my heart. Terry, you got to be kidding. - You look darling. - But, Terry, 400... Take a look. Don't you love it? It's wonderful. Then what's the matter? For what this dress costs I could buy a dishwasher. Why, would Harvey get mad? Oh, it's not Harvey, my friend. It's reality. - You sure? - Yeah. I'm sure. (SIGHS) Okay, I understand. I love your dress. (GIGGLES) Listen, M.B., I've been thinking, why don't I buy the dress for you? Are you out of your mind? I can't let you do that. You look great in it, and it matches mine perfectly. Please, Terry. I can't afford the dress, and this is embarrassing, okay? Hey, don't be like that. Come on, I love you, we know each other too well for this. Terry, I can't. Really. Thanks. I'll take some time off, we'll keep on looking. We'll find something else, I promise. Excuse me. Hello there. What company do you work for? - PETRIE: Bronson Security? - That's what it said on the man's jacket. And this is the basic uniform Bronson Security uses? - Right. I checked with the supplier. - Okay. Get rid of the Bronson Security patch and the yellow stripe right here. ARTIST: Mmm-hmm. Put in a navy blue stripe instead. And a triangle emblem right there, that's what the witnesses said. Black buttons instead of the police brass. There were no identifying precinct numbers, but there was a circular patch right... Well, you got it. That's it. Well, let's get some witnesses down here, identify the sketches. - Your friend, Elizabeth Jordan. - I can't, I really can't. She's here. - Why? She had nothing more to give us. - Don't ask me. All right. Okay. What's wrong? My family said, "I told you so," for living in New York. You don't return my calls. Well, I've been out there fighting the bad guys. You can be flip. You did not have a gun down your throat. Elizabeth, I'm very aware of what you have been through. Once more, with feeling. What is that supposed to mean? Please don't do this to me. It was hard enough leaving the apartment. What am I doing? I mean, I just don't understand. (SIGHS) I just want to know that somebody in this city bureaucracy gives a damn. Okay? Now maybe that's being naive. I'm working 10 hours a day on this case. I do care. - You care about the case. - That's right. Period. Look, why don't we give you a call in case there's anything else that we might need? I'm lousy at this job, you know. No, I didn't know. I mean, I'm good at parts of it but... (SIGHING) Oh, boy, sometimes can I blow it. Well, since I'm a perfect person myself, I have no idea what you are talking about. If the woman is bugging you, shine her on. You don't have to baby-sit. I saved the world a lot of grief by not going into social work. I hate to tell you, we are in social work. LACEY: You know, this city isn't such a bad place to live. CAGNEY: Are you kidding? It's terrific. I love it. You can ride your bike, you can get Chinese food and egg creams. - We got trees. - You can get that stuff anywheres. No, it's not the same. - Do you ever think about getting out? - Sometimes. For a weekend, you know. - Where's this coming from? - I don't know. It's just every once in a while I think it might be nice to live someplace else. - Connecticut or someplace. - Like your friend Terry? Yeah, like my friend Terry. We service over 200 companies in the New York-New Jersey area. Do you know how many guys pass through here? Well, they must go through a training program. Aren't they bonded? Yeah, but they come through here with a phony ID. By the time I've checked them out, they've taken my uniforms and weapons, they get me in big trouble with the license bureau. LACEY: Terrific. Yeah, sure. They got it all worked out, these geniuses. This is the element I'm dealing with. Just take another look at this drawing. Now, what are their names? Where were they assigned? Does nothing ring a bell here? You wanna go ring doorbells? (BUZZES) Here, here. Here's a list of my clients. Be my guest. - Excuse me, where do I report a theft? - Is it over $1,500? Considerably. I guess with inflation nowadays, there isn't much under 1,500. Can I get a detective down here, please? Grand Larceny. What was stolen, sir? This. And then? I went to Francois to replace the ring that had been stolen from my wife. They had this necklace there that also had a ruby on it. I thought she'd like it, so I bought it and had it appraised. They told me that the ruby had a flaw in it, a hairline crack that diminished its value by about a third. So I took a look at it myself. I'd seen that crack before. And that's how I knew that this is the ruby that was in the ring that was stolen from my wife. And you bought this necklace at a jewelry store? As I say, one of the finest in New York. Where was your wife when the ring was stolen? Oh, we were going to the theater, otherwise she wouldn't have been wearing it. So she was mugged. No, worse than that. She was having her hair done, and two men dressed as policemen came in and stole everything that anyone had. - I know it's unbelievable. - Oh, we believe you. You don't think we had anything to do with this, do you? Do you recognize these men? No. I don't. Francois, why are you so nervous? I cater to a very special clientele. They come to me for advice on how to invest their money. I make a recommendation of a gem or whatever. I would feel a great deal of responsibility if that advice turned out to be fallacious. You mean, we mustn't let this get out. Where'd you buy this ruby? We have several suppliers. I can look it up. Do us a favor. Hello, Mrs. Patterson. I'll be with you in just a wink. Yes. Here it is. Pear-shaped ruby, six carats, purchased by F. Crockett, that's me. From R. Walker. Ronald Walker. Who's that? A wholesaler. Nice fellow, Canadian. Now, is there anything else I can do for you? What is your relationship with Ronald Walker? He comes in, he shows me his collection, and I buy something. VoilÃ . - Now, I have got to... - We're not finished here. - I am terribly sorry. - So am I. I think my lawyer should be present. You don't need a lawyer. I want to believe, for the moment, that you had no knowledge of that gem being stolen when you bought it. - Thank you. - And at the same time, I'm asking your cooperation. - Or what? - CAGNEY: "Or what," nothing. Do you think we're gonna beat you up with rubber hoses? I'm just not a big fan of the police. I knew it. He's got a record. Where was it? Out of state? Oh, no. It's nothing like that. My father was a cop, and we didn't get along. My father sold furniture. Does that mean I'm never gonna sit on a couch? What do you want me to do? I want you to help us nail Ronald Walker. CAGNEY: We think he's involved with two impersonators who are ripping off beauty salons. They steal the stuff, Walker resets it and he sells it to legitimate jewelers like you. So, we want you to sign a Safe Harmless. It means you don't hold the police department liable in case anything happens to you while you're acting as our agent. Your agent? You want me to go undercover? - As what? - Yourself. VoilÃ . You see the little love letter we got from the Deputy Inspector? LACEY: Yeah. Well, you're the one who wanted to be task force leader. We're okay. We're moving now. All we've got to do is to keep the momentum going. So, you coming with? Sorry. I got a big meeting tonight. Harv, Harv Jr. and I. The science fair is tomorrow. We have to solve the riddle of the electromagnet. Come on, Mary Beth. I mean, you're as much a part of this as I am. I'll go with you to talk to Elizabeth Jordan first thing in the morning. It's not a problem. I can take care of her myself. I didn't say you couldn't. But if I were her, I would not be too eager to cooperate with the police. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you, I feel that she's a lot stronger than she says she is. Good. How much do you charge an hour? Give me a break, will you? By helping us out on this case, she's also going to help herself. - That's convenient. - What is it you want from me? Nothing. Good luck. See you tomorrow. Oh, my Lord. Come on. Come on, baby. Harv, I'm not going to that wedding. Why not? Too far away? No. She wants me to be in the bridal party and she's got expensive taste. Yeah. How expensive? She wants me to buy a dress costs $450, not including tax. That's totally nuts. Yeah. Well, it's her second marriage. Maybe she figures, if she throws money at it, it'll stick. Why, can't you find another dress? No. She wants this one. So I told her I couldn't spend that kind of money. Good. So she offered to buy the dress for me. Get the checkbook. Get it out right away. Who does she think she is, huh? What is that? Living in Connecticut, marrying a doctor, that makes her a queen bee? You go and buy the dress. Isn't that cutting off our nose to spite our face? (SIGHS) Why couldn't he grow lima beans like last year? I'll tell her something came up. She can find somebody else to fit the damn dress. (ELECTRICITY SURGING) CAGNEY: Elizabeth, please understand. There is more to what I'm asking than just police work. Now, I've thought a lot about your situation. Now, you think nobody in the department cares about you and that all we want to do is solve this case. Now, you've asked for my advice, and I'm going to tell you what I think. Help us, for your own good. I don't want those men near me. I don't want those men in this house. How can I be brave when I want to curl up into a ball... You know, I understand that. But if you do this, it'll give you a feeling of having some control, taking some action. If you don't, I just don't think you're ever gonna leave this apartment. Which feels very good to me right now. I'm sure it does, for now. - You've gotta come, M.B. - No, I don't think so. See, the thing came up with Harvey's aunt... - I need you there. - For what? To let me know that it's right. Are you still asking yourself? Not a lot, but once in a while it comes up. Now, we gotta talk about this. No. We don't. Really. 'Cause I made up my mind. It's a choice, like you made a choice to do what you're doing. I just wish I had your guts. It doesn't take guts. I don't mean police work. I mean everything. - Really? I had no idea. - You didn't? No, I thought you looked down on me, offering to buy that dress and everything. - What's the matter? You didn't like it? - You're kidding. I loved it. Of course, you did. And who picked it out for you? I wanted you to have it. I thought you were just showing off. Like you buying me those candlesticks? - What's the matter? You didn't like them? - I loved them. Showing off. Remember, that's what we used to say about Randy Greenwald, - down the street. - Yeah. Oh, yeah, I do. (BOTH LAUGHING) - So, about the dress. - No. Listen. We'll find another dress. I'm getting married. I'm taking the plunge. I don't care what you wear. I just want you to be there. I'll be there. Okay. I have some quality freshwater pearls, hard to find these days. Yes, I know. Excuse me, I'll be right back. Okay. Go. I feel silly. Go. Hello, Francois. Miss Cagney, hello. This is Ronald Walker. He supplies many of our gems. Mr. Walker. Pleasure to meet you. Aren't those beautiful? - Are you interested in pearls? - Oh, always. Francois, do you have my Apple jade? It should be in next week. Well, I certainly hope it brings me more luck than it did a friend of mine. Jade is supposed to be very lucky. Not for Elizabeth, poor dear. You know, she was being coiffed at her salon. She has the most fabulous hair. And thieves, mind you, thieves broke in and tried to take her jade and diamond ring, but they couldn't get it off her finger. Well, see there, that's luck. Well, one would think so. The ring is only worth a small fortune. And she's such a darling. Well, you know Elizabeth, don't you, Francois? Mrs. Jordan. Of course. She's one of my most cherished customers. She has that fabulous collection of jewelry and Chinese antiques. Really? Oh, yes. And the poor darling is so upset, she won't leave her apartment. And she has the most gorgeous place on West 72nd Street. The Blackwell, I'm sure you know it. So, who can blame her? Anyway, the whole ordeal has been perfectly awful. - Be sure and give her my very best. - I certainly will, Francois. - I'll phone you when your ring arrives. - Excellent. - Mr. Walker, it's been a pleasure. - My pleasure. Petrie here. I can see the entrance. And the other cars are in position. Okay. They're on their way up now. You all set? Wanna give me a test? ISBECKI: Where's the Jordan woman? CA GNEY: The department's putting her up at a hotel. Good. Then it'll just be you and me up there. It'll be you and you up there. (LA UGHING) See you later, guys. Stay in touch. I'm getting an elevator. Just take it easy. CA GNEY: I can't breathe. ISBECKI: Calm down. There's no need to hurt anybody here. Suspects are already in the apartment. - Calm down. - Officer needs assistance, 10-13. Let's go. 10-4. We're on our way. Please, mister. I can't breathe. Please. Just let me go. I'll give you whatever you want. (GRUNTS) Police! We're police! (GUN FIRES) Freeze where you are! Hold it right there! - Don't shoot! - Don't do it! - Chris, you all right? - Yeah. Hi. How're you feeling? Great. That's what you get for trying something on the first date. - Morning, Lieutenant. - Hi. Oh, well. What do we need his approval for, anyway? Well, the impostor turned in Ronald Walker, we got most of the stuff back. - We did good. - We did good. Oh, you want this from Elizabeth Jordan? It's her phone number. 203 number. What is that, Connecticut? Yeah. She's moving out of the city. Giving up that terrific view? She's moving back in with her folks. What happened to the strength she didn't know she had? I don't know. I guess she just couldn't get it back together. Maybe it's right for her. (SIGHING) Yeah, maybe so. Don't break your heart, Chris. No, I'm not. I'll tell you, I was thinking about giving her a call. You know, couple of months, when this thing blows over. - Don't do it. - Why not? You'd be doing it for you, not for her. It's okay. I can do it for me. Yeah, you can. (SAMUELS AND MARQUETTE ARGUING) I'll handle this. - Let me just talk to you one more minute. - No! What's the Deputy Inspector so upset about? (GROANS) It had to do with you and your case and the task force and everything. - How'd we mess up? - You didn't, I did. I put in for departmental recognition for you and your team, and Marquette hates to give it out. - He does? - Yeah. I should have waited till next month just before he goes on vacation. I would have slipped it right by him. Dumb. Dumb. It's dumb.
