 To tell you the truth, Christine Cagney, I yearn for you. I burn for you. Wake me when he says something interesting. Until I see Isbecki walk in here and tell me he's fine, I gotta figure they're going to kill him. I've got no feelings. It's my job. Oh, I see. Punch in, have coffee, take a life. Isbecki could die because I screwed up. Get your hands over your head! If Isbecki dies, man, we ain't gonna care who we expose to find out who did it.

 Oh, excuse me, sir. I would have been here sooner, but I thought there was gonna be four of you. Isn't one of me enough? Oh, come on, Isbecki, that's about the worst line I've ever heard. Yes, sir. Would you like to order now? Sounds good to me. I was thinking of a little takeout. I take it back. This one's gonna be worse. - After work, if you're free... - After work, if you're free, is that right? I'm sorry. I'm not on the menu. - Very nice. Very nice. - Way to tell him, lady. Probably married or something, anyway. Of course, I don't really care 'cause, to tell you the truth, Christine Cagney, I long only for you. I pine for you. I yearn for you. I burn for you.

 Wake me when he says something interesting. Okay? Oh, hold it. I've got some company. We'll be talking to you. You from Tony Brown? Yo. Yo? What, he's under cover as Sylvester Stallone? Hey, Tony said you might have some chauffeur work available, huh? Maybe. They don't have any egg fu yong. Hey, there's no worry. I've been stealing cars all my life. Hey, why don't you cool it with the... I can't eat this spicy garbage. I'll be up all night with heartburn. Hey, why don't you just give me your shopping list and I'll get it for you? Listen. My problem's always been selling them. Where do you guys unload these... - All right, none of your business is where. - Don't be nervous. Selling them is stupid. What's a new Porsche worth, $25,000? You chop that same car into parts, sell them separate, you're looking at 60 grand. And no registration problems. Smart. How much do I get? Hundred-and-a-half per. Two. What kind of Chinese is this? They don't even have chop suey. Would you get off my case? Can't we go to Fung Ling, Joe? I mean, you love the wonton soup there. All right. Fung Ling. - You mind? - ISBECKI: Fung Ling. - Where's that? - This way. - Aren't we gonna follow? - I know Fung Ling. We'll get there first. - We'll be less conspicuous. - All right. You know, I just had a taste for Italian. What do you think, Joe? You know, that new place we went last week. Italian. Yeah, that sounds good. Sausage and pepper. Chinese, damn it. Go to Fung Ling. JOE: What about you guys? BILLY: It's okay with me, I guess. - You remember the way? - Yeah, no problems. Isbecki, find out where it is. ISBECKI: What's the name of that restaurant again? Hey, what's it to you, man? Are you writing a book or something? Hey, man, I just want to know where I'm eating, that's all. JOE: I don't remember. It's Italian. - We've gotta go back. - Turn here. LACEY: Oh, my Lord. (MOTORISTS ARGUING) - Back it up. Back it up. - I can't. (CARS HONKING) - Back it up! - Move it, damn it! MAN: Hey, will you guys move out of the way... Hey, wait, wait. Joe, Joe. Hey, you say you know Tony Brown from school, right? Yeah, right. So, tell me, where'd you go to school, man, Harlem? Yeah. You know what? You're a liar, man. Grab him, Dave. Hey, what do you guys think you're doing, man? Wait, wait, wait. Joe, Joe, look. This guy's a cop. DA VE: What are we gonna do with a cop, man? - Why does everything happen to me? - Get him out of here. Wait a minute, let me get the wires. (RADIO TRANSMISSION BUZZES) Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! I want you to clear all airwaves. We've got an emergency here. - We got a 10-53 and a 10-13. - Come on! We got a kidnap in progress. Clear it out, this is Detective Car 12. We've gotta go on the assumption that his life's in danger. You didn't hear these guys, Lieutenant. They're just smalltime car thieves. They're not cop killers. You back an animal into a corner, and he becomes a killer. Until I see Isbecki walk in here and tell me he's fine, I gotta figure they're going to kill him. Petrie, you know Tony Brown? The stoolie? Yeah, I know him from my days on the beat in Harlem. Yeah, well, we used him on this. You find him, 'cause he's a key. In the meantime, La Guardia, Davidson, you hit the files. We're looking for known felons, recently released or on parole. You got it. Cagney, Lacey, I want you to check out salvage operators. Get whatever you can. Drop everything else, 'cause we're staying on this and only this until we get Isbecki. MAN ON P.A.:...salvage, Santa Fe, New Mexico, looking for a front end on a '76 Stingray. Let me call you back. Can we stick to the subject here? Did he say a front end? Yeah, a front end. Could we just get back to what we were talking about? (PHONE RINGING) I haven't got a front end! I've got a rear end, '75, but you wouldn't want that. Hello? He hung up. (DIAL TONE DRONING) - He'll call back, sir. - We're talking about chop shops. - What? - Chop shops in the area. Oh, hell, they've got them all over the place, not just in this area. Chicago... I know that, Mr. Boston. Very big operation in Chicago. - What we need... - We got a late model Porsche Solex carb. They'll call back. You've got a very bad attitude, bright eyes. Hey, look, I'm just trying here. What do you want from me? I don't run a chop shop here. I would if I had the clangers or the Mediterranean backup, but I don't. Well, that's great. You're talking to two cops, saying you'd be a felon if you could get away with it. All I'm saying is they're making out a hell of a lot better than I am. - Because they underbid. - Right, you got it. Bingo. Look, a call comes over that speaker for a part, see? Joe Blow Salvage Smack, he offers bottom-line price. Then the smart chop shop guys, they get on that phone and they drop the price by 100 or so. They might not even have the part, you know. But they make the sale and they get one of their bobbers to go out and steal that particular part. I mean, how long does it take to bob, 30 seconds? Anyone out there got an Aston grille? Listen, that's my telephone! Do you know anybody in the area who's doing a lot of heavy underbidding? I don't know. Everybody, nobody. Why don't we just cut the tap-dance, huh? A cop's life's in danger. So what, the world stops turning? Anybody out there got a five-speed transmission for an Audi Fox? Mr. Boston, you can do us and yourself a favor. If you hear anything over the loudspeaker... If I do, I'll call. (TELEPHONE RINGING) After I call them and try to see if they can sell me a franchise. Hello. MAN:...keep going. Keep going. That's it. Thanks. You know, my cousin's been looking for a door for his Maserati for six months. Oh, yeah? Well, we get them in here all the time. - How much? - I don't know, man. I just cut them. But you wouldn't find yourself a better deal anywhere else. Billy, Dave, come in here a second. We gotta snuff him. I didn't get in this to murder nobody. Forget it. Just check yourself. I could come down on you or him. Our benefactor's in no mood to play. - Billy. - Wait, Joe... Billy. - Your good friend Tony Brown. - Yeah. Did he burn us? Mr. Fisher. What's the word, man? Officer Petrie, long time no see. Detective. You know I copped the gold shield, brother. Yeah, I heard. Congratulations. I'm looking for Tony B. Tony B? You been over to his place? Yeah. Well, I haven't seen him. Well, if you do, give me a holler, man. Call the 14th. Help! Help! Help! Hey, brother, help this woman. Watch your step. Police! (GIBBERING) Police! Halt! Halt! Get back! Police! Excuse me, Officer! Excuse me, Officer! Excuse me, Officer. Excuse me, Officer. Police. Halt! Don't do it. Don't do it! We tried salvage yards and repair shops to see who underbids. - Did you find anything? - No luck. Anything here? Well, Petrie shot an 18-year-old purse snatcher up in Harlem. Kid's dead. - Oh, Lord, how's Marcus doing? - Okay, I guess. CAGNEY: Can you help me out over here? There must be 1,000 of these things. - You got Manhattan? - Yeah. - Then I'll take Queens. - Okay. Yeah. Hello. I'm looking for a transmission for an '81 380SL. What's the lowest bid you can give me? Did you find anything? Nothing. I heard what happened. Are you all right? He drew, I fired. I'm fine. - What'd the Duty Captain say? - Justifiable. It's a good shoot. This is ludicrous. I've got to find Tony Brown. Isbecki is out there somewhere. They're making me sit here and wait for the Review Board interview. - You wanna do the Bronx? - Sure. - We're looking for the lowest bidder. - LACEY: Yes, what can you do for... - Detective Petrie. - Yes. Can I have a word with you? Daniels, can I help you? Hello, Lieutenant. No, we just need a photograph of Detective Petrie. - For what? - Press release. Excuse me. Towards what end? Community relations, image enhancement, you understand. Certainly, I do. Black child killed by a cop could cause a problem. But show my black face and maybe everybody'll stay cool. Look, we don't want any incidents like they had in Miami. And so I become the poster boy in some racist publicity game. I understand that you're not happy, but I need this for this afternoon's paper. I'm afraid you don't have much choice in the matter. - I'll be damned if I don't. - Now, wait. Hold it. Daniels, I cannot allow this. I need Petrie back up in Harlem. His partner is missing, for God's sake. You put his picture in the paper, you take his shield away. - Listen, I understand the difficulty... - Like hell you do. ...but we're dealing with a case of greater evils. The hell you do. - City Hall... - I am not doing it. You wouldn't want my picture if I were white. Well, maybe you wouldn't have shot so fast if the kid was. Look, I didn't come here to debate. Lieutenant, this order comes from the very top. Now, either Detective Petrie complies or I bring him up on charges. - Detective Petrie. - What? Give me that! Easy. Easy. All right, get out of here. Sorry. I lost my temper. Al Brunley. The last address we had was 3972... Don't give me that, Wilson. You owe us. What is taking so long? Please give it to... I'll do it myself. 14th Squad, Detective Lacey. May I help you? Just a moment, sir. Christine, pick up on three. Petrie, trace on three. Yes, sir, I'm on the line and my partner is also. This is Cagney. I know where your cop is. Is he hurt? Where is he? Slow down. Slow down. All right. I'm a cutter in a chop shop. You understand? You know what that is? Yes. Okay, I'm greedy, but I'm no killer. Are you telling us he's gonna be killed? Unless you can give me immunity, then right. Well, we can try, sir. No, you better do it. We can do it. The DA's office will probably want you to testify. No way, no way. Now, wait a minute, come on. You wanna play? No, absolutely no way. You listen, I want that put down on those immunity papers. I don't turn no state's evidence. Right, I'm gonna call you back at 3:00, you understand? And I want you to bring the papers over, and I'm gonna read them. And if everything's okay, you'll get your cop. (DIAL TONE DRONING) - Nothing. - 3:00. Do you think he'll deliver? - It's the only lead we've got. - We need it by 3:00, sir. I'll get it. I don't know how, but I'll get it. One other thing, he wants no state's evidence on the papers. - You agreed to that? - Well, he didn't give us much choice. Sorry, sir. Does that mean the DA's gonna want a pound of flesh? That I wouldn't mind. He's gonna want my soul. I'll go check the backup. Marcus. - Well? - No dice. The Duty Captain says you can't go on backup until you finish the FRB interview. What the hell am I supposed to do? Well, if Samuels isn't back in 12 minutes, it won't make a difference. Hey, Marcus, can I talk? I know that we're in an emergency situation here, so you haven't had time to sort out your stuff. - What stuff? - About the shoot. There's no stuff about the shoot. The perp had a gun. Don't play me off, Petrie. I know, okay? I killed a kid last year, remember? I know all about that Superman-on-the-job business. Oh, you do? Yes, I do, and as soon as we find Isbecki, you're gonna have to go over your feelings about shooting that boy today. I've got no feelings. It's my job. Oh, I see. Punch in, have coffee, take a life, punch out. You better get back in there or you're going to miss the call. We'll find him, Chris. I should have waited at the restaurant. I blew it. A simple tail and I blew it. - It was a judgment call. - And I blew it. Isbecki could die because I screwed up. Would you quit beating yourself up? We will find him. (PHONE RINGING) He's five minutes early. Where is Samuels? I don't know. Stall. This is Detective Cagney. Yes, I have the papers right here. I'm here. Yes, I have them right in my hand. Right. Exactly as you asked, no testimony. All right, give me the address. I know where it is. All right, 20 minutes. We'll be there. - Where? - SoHo. Here's the address. Warn the backup. - What're we gonna do? - OFFICER: Meet you out front. I got it. But it's contingent on being a material witness. The DA just wasn't interested in my flesh. - The pickup is in SoHo, sir. - He's not gonna go for it. Well, you just have to convince him. Follow him if you have to. Just get Isbecki back here. CAGNEY: Testing, testing, testing. Can you hear me? I read you loud and clear. I got you. What's the plan? I don't know. We'll figure it out when we get there. LACEY: If we get there. If he knows we're looking for him, and I'm sure he does... Well, did you try Silky's? What about Big Dee Hawkins? She should know. What? You're a detective. Use your imagination. Tony Brown is no fool, Taubeman. Taubeman. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, what's going on around here? This place is like a morgue. I saw your photograph on the city desk. What happened out there? Read the press blotter. Come on, Marcus, I need a story. I'm not allowed to discuss the circumstances of the shooting. Then let's talk about your reactions to the incident. No, let's not. It's bad enough having my picture in the papers. That was done without your consent? Lynne. I can't give you an interview. Off the record then. - Why? - I'm curious. No. I've got work. They're running your photograph to cool off tempers uptown. You don't mind being a political pawn? It wasn't my idea. Then what about allegations from some community leaders that most cops walk into a black neighborhood with one hand on their service revolvers, the other hand over their eyes? But that wouldn't apply in my case, would it? I don't know. When was the last time you took your wife to dinner in Harlem? Three Sundays ago. Why? A thoroughly assimilated black man like yourself could be diseased with the same fears as a white man. - You're reaching. - Am I? Hell, Marcus, I don't go uptown without a whistle, Mace and my tennis shoes. I admit it, why can't you? Miss Sutter, you're gonna have to leave here now. The cavalry. Take care, Detective Petrie. Lieutenant from the Firearms Review Board is here for your interview now. Don't worry about it. Looks good. - Word on Tony Brown? - No, not yet. That kid thinks we're being silly. We look silly. I didn't think they had these things anymore. I know he's watching us. Probably. That's why he wanted us both in the same booth. (PHONE RINGING) I wish I knew where he was calling from. Your guess is as bad as mine. We're going to have to squeeze him. Backup, stand by. You take it. You've got the wire. Yeah. Hello? Okay. Okay, so far so good. Now listen, this is how we're gonna do this thing. Hold it. You're probably watching us. So you can see I have the papers. So far you've been calling this game, but now we're gonna start doing things a little differently here. Forget it. Look, you can be charged with kidnapping, conspiracy to murder a police officer, grand larceny. And you can have yourself a dead detective. So you tell me, what's it gonna be? Not to mention federal prosecution for transporting stolen goods across state lines. You could get at least 30 years with consecutive sentencing. The deal's off. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute! Let's not blow this. I'm just trying to show you that we both have something to offer. You can't expect total immunity without some concessions. Listen. We're gonna do this thing my way or we ain't gonna do it at all. What's your way? Okay. All right, now listen. You have your partner open the door. Open the door. He says open the door. Okay, good. There's a little girl with a ball. She's gonna come over. I want you to give her the papers. Okay, she's gonna bring the papers over to me. You just sit tight. You and your friend wait there in the booth. (DIAL TONE DRONING) He's hard scared. He'll never accept those papers. The kid went around the corner. Next move? I don't know. We can't wait here. Well, we'd better take the kid while we can. Backup, we're moving. Get her. Hey! Hey, kid, halt, halt! Watch the car, watch the car! Hey! He told me if you follow me to run around the corner and give this back to you. Where is he? He was in a coffee shop. - All right. - Easy. Damn it! Hey, Joe. How about some water? Okay. (JOE SCREAMING) MAN 1: Hey! Get him. MAN 2: Come back here. Go ahead, do it. (PHONE RINGING) - Detective Cagney. - BOSTON: Hey, which one are you? Excuse me? Yeah, this is Merrill Boston. You know, Advance and Boston Salvage. Mr. Boston, do you have something for us? Is this the one with the fiery blue eyes? What is this garbage? That's you. I couldn't remember. Cagney, Lacey. Lacey, Cagney. It's all Frick and Frack to me. Mr. Boston, I do not have time to play games with you. Now, do you have anything for me or not? You've got eyes like a Siberian husky. I'm hanging up. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I've got some information for you. Yeah, the guy's name is Stobbart. He runs an operation called the Stallion Salvage. Pretty good, huh? - Is he an underbidder? - Yeah, one of them, anyway. Listen. You didn't get that from me. Thank you. Hey, wait. You know, you've got a very cute nose, too. (MAN CHA TTERING ON P.A.) Hello. - What can I do for you? - We'd like to look around. - Do you have a warrant? - Do we need one? No. I'm just a little tired today, that's all. What is it you're looking for? Stolen vehicles. Well, if you find any out here, it'll be news to me. But be my guest and give it your best shot. Thank you. But if I can help you in any way, I'll be inside. Thanks. - Now, where do we start? - Do I know? LACEY: If Stobbart is involved in this, he sure is cool about it. - What're we doing here? - Wasting our time. If he had Isbecki, he wouldn't be hiding him here. So, we're back to square one. Let's see what the computer turns up on Stobbart. Yeah. God, that thing's gruesome. I don't think the cars feel it. Hey, Joe. If it was for me, I hope you told her that I was all tied up tonight. Hey, you can at least laugh. When you finish with the Porsche, we go. You go. We go, all of us. Hey, Joe, how come we all have to go? 'Cause that's how the order came down. I don't like it. Who gives a damn? Hurry up with that car. It's more than three hours, and they haven't found a thing. - Of course they haven't and they won't. - Lieutenant. Yeah, what? I've got three men out there. And obviously, with all due respect, they're not making any progress. Juvenile called. They're holding a suspect over there, grand larceny auto. - He claims to have worked in a chop shop. - Yeah, that's good. - Oh, Isbecki's mother called again. - Good, thanks. I know Tony Brown. I can find him. - Taubeman's got your list of probables. - Taubeman? A stoolie like Tony Brown isn't going to surface without some firsthand information. Lieutenant, I can get it. - Have you reached Morgan yet? - Not yet. Well, stay on it, will you? Try him at Benny's in the Village. - So, what do you say? - So, I already said no. You're on modified assignment until the FRB completes that report. - You're playing technicalities. - Technicalities, huh? Take a look at this. Take a look at this, then tell me how much good you're gonna do in Harlem. Anything? No, sir. Stobbart doesn't have a rap sheet. We're waiting on the feds. Chop shop. Got out a month ago. It's a long shot. Lacey, I want you and Cagney to go over and see Isbecki's mother. What are we looking for? Well, she said he left some case notes over at her house. - Petrie, interrogate this kid. - Sure. What kid? A GLA suspect supposedly stealing cars for a chop shop. Thank you, sir. Wait, hold it. Hold it, I changed my mind. Cagney, I want you to handle Mrs. Isbecki on your own. Lacey, I want you to go with Petrie. Wait a minute. Why does she have to go with me? Because I said so. - I don't need a babysitter, Lieutenant. - Come on, I know that. Why can't you stop trying to be the great white father? I have my own father, thank you. - Calm down. - Damn it. If you people would simply - allow me to do my job! - That's enough! That is enough! All right, Lacey, watch out for him. He's gonna hate it, sir. I gave you an order! Watch out for him! Yes, sir. Sorry, my boy isn't talking, so you two might as well just truck on back to the Precinct. I beg your pardon. All right, do you want it in legal jargon? I'm the court-appointed counsel for Alfred Pathiev, who chooses at this time to exercise his constitutional right to remain silent. Have you heard about that? We have, and maybe you've heard there's a detective out there whose life is in danger. Well, unfortunately for you, the only life I'm concerned with is Alfred Pathiev's. We are not trying to hurt him, Mr. Blair. Right, and if I believe that, you've got some nice story about the tooth fairy, right? Listen. Have a very pleasant evening, and I'll see you around the courthouse. - You enjoyed this. - Petrie. You know something, you're very lucky I've got a bad memory. Now, I'm gonna forget you ever laid a hand on me. I'm gonna find Tony Brown. You can't go to Harlem now. It's dangerous. Your picture's in the paper. - Isbecki's going to die. - Don't say that. Go on back to the Precinct. I'll grab a cab uptown. No. Either you come back to work with me or I'm going up there with you. You and me, fellow. Hey, baby. Yo, Jimmy, what it be like? Don't shoot. Now, back off that stuff. Give me a break, man. You know me. Yeah. I'm looking for Tony B. Tony B. Tony B. Who? Who? You always use black as a second language when you come uptown? Yes. I suppose we make an attractive couple, killer cop and his white broad. I bet. I hope you don't hate me for saying this, Marcus. I'm scared. So am I. Cagney, what did Mrs. Isbecki tell you? She said she hoped Victor would settle down with a nice girl one day. - Oh, come on, Cagney. - I'm telling you. She said when he was a little boy, Victor didn't ever wanna be a policeman, that he wanted to be a Wild West gunfighter. But when you live in Brooklyn, what're you gonna do? - Did she have anything on his case notes? - Yeah. Here. "Warriors, plus five and a half. Clippers, Jazz, plus ten. "Celtics plus six, Lakers..." - What the hell is this? - His basketball point spread. Oh, that's great. That's terrific. (WHISPERING) It's 3:45. Give him two, three more minutes. If he doesn't deliver an address, we move on. I dunno where. We've already hit all the spots I could think of. See, Tony knows we're looking for him, unless the boys from the chop shop already found him. How's Lauren? Lauren. Yeah, Lauren. From my soul, she already has that twinkle in her eyes, like Claudia. She sees everything. I think she senses when I'm not all together. She gives me this look. Somehow I know that she knows, and I feel like I've... I feel like I've already got a new best friend. Damn, he has to be around here somewhere. Harlem's not that big. It's big enough to get lost in. That's true. This place seems so different now. I used to think Harlem was the only place in the city that didn't smell like old tar. When I walked the beat up here, it was kind of like preserving a shrine, you know. I mean, I knew there was a lot wrong here, too. There's too many people, too few jobs, no money, bad housing. But then I walked past the Schomburg library or the Apollo and... Magic. Now it just seems like a slum to me. - A slum? - Not the place, the people. Now, where is this man? Maybe we ought to try Silky's again. Can I have the check, babe, please? Be right there, honey. Patience is a virtue, Marcus. Give him a few minutes. You're right. You're right. Slow down, Marcus. I'm really messing up. My friend, you're the best detective in the squad. Everybody knows it. Not today. When that boy attacked that old woman, I almost wanted to walk away from it. I didn't care. Not about the old woman, not about the boy. I just did my job. Maybe I could have talked the kid down. But I didn't try. I wanted to make damn sure I didn't die at the hands of someone I had no respect for. See, I shot quickly because I... No, I... No. I killed a boy because he was black. Harlem hasn't changed. I've changed. See, I've become like everybody else on the outside, prejudiced, afraid, even repulsed. - Claudia and I have accomplished a lot. - Yes. We've tried so hard to make it. And now, I can't see the magic. Marcus, you want my two cents? I don't think you shot that kid because he was black. I think you shot him because he had a gun. I don't know that. He had a gun. And he would have killed Lauren's best friend. Here you go. Thank you. We got it. Who is it? Marcus Petrie. Go to hell, John Wayne. LACEY: Hi, Tony. Back up two steps. Oh, Brother Petrie, what seems to be the problem? I've been looking for you, Tony. - You have? - Man, you know we have. We've called your number, been to your apartment. Been hiding from us, Tony? No, man, it's my lady's place. I'm here. The setup with Isbecki fell apart. You're kidding. They're gonna kill him, man. We need to know where. Hey, what makes you think that I... Who'd you make contact with? Look, I don't even know these people. This was set up by a friend of a friend. I don't even know who owns that chop shop. There's very little time, and I'm sure you have some idea, at least a guess, of who's on top. And you're gonna tell us, because if Isbecki dies, man, we ain't gonna care who we expose to find out who did it. Now, Tony. A guy named Stobbart. Stallion Salvage? Yeah. ISBECKI: Hey! Someone get me out of here. (SIRENS WAILING) Stop this! Get me out! Freeze, buddy. You're under arrest. All right, cuff him. (CRUSHER WHIRRING) Hold it right there! Against the car! Police! Hold it! Hold it! Get your hands over your head! Over your head! He's in the crusher! He's in the crusher! Take him. Get over there! Shut it off! ISBECKI: Stop this thing. Hey. Don't shoot. Please don't shoot. ISBECKI: Somebody get me out of here. CAGNEY: Help! Somebody help me! Help! Damn it, does anybody know how to work this thing? Stop! Damn it! Stop! Victor! Victor! Thank God you're all right. Watch your head. Watch your head. Here, I got you. - Here, Cagney. - Be careful. - How are you, buddy? We've got you. - Come on, be careful. - He may have broken bones. - Don't worry. Don't worry. Mind your back. How's your back? - Watch his legs. - Where are the paramedics? Hey, get him out as fast as you can, though. This thing isn't gonna hold. - Slide him out easy. - Watch my back. - Watch his legs. - Careful. Careful. - I got his legs. - Okay. Set him down. Set him down, will you? I think I can walk. Let me try. Let me untie his hands. - I got him. I got him. - Put your... - I got it. I got it. - Oh, jeez. - Get some help, somebody. - Oh, yeah. - How's your back, huh? - Yeah, okay. - It's okay. Look, I'm all right. - Okay. Are you sure you can walk? Maybe we shouldn't. Let's just wait for the paramedics, huh? - I can walk if you help me. - Okay. We'll walk together, but you lean on me. We'll take it slow, okay? - Yeah. - All right. Victor, I'm sorry. I'm the one who blew the tail. - It wasn't your fault. - Yes, it was my fault, and I'm very sorry. Forget it. - What'd they do to you? - Everything. I can't believe how close we came to losing you. Hey, it's over. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm glad you're okay. Then tuck me in tonight. (GROANING) I cannot stand that man! Cagney, it's unbelievable! You wouldn't believe what they did to me! They had me in this little room, tied up, face down! Then they had me chained to this barbwire post! Then they ran the soles of my feet over this bamboo! You wouldn't believe it! And then they took these Japanese water torches across my neck. - CAGNEY: Lock that door. Don't let him in. - Cagney, you gotta listen to me! I understand that Cagney is so ticked off at Isbecki, she wants to kill him. Hey, Petrie, wait. The woman... The mother of the boy you shot is here. She came in a couple of hours ago. She wants to talk to you. She didn't seem too crazy or anything, so I told her to wait in Samuels' office, you know. Listen, Petrie, if you want to, go ahead home, I'll talk to her. No. You weren't there. I'm Detective Petrie. I understand you wish to speak with me.
