 And she's been in a wheelchair ever since. - Is she permanently disabled? - They don't know. The doctors and nurses where she goes for therapy are the ones who gave her the bike. You know, you got a mouth on you, kid. Makes up for my legs. That bike is the one thing she's got that means something to her, Mary Beth. She feels like she's lost everything. What is happening to her is called grief. She's gotta work her way through it. There's no way you can wave a magic wand and make it all better. (POLICE SIREN WAILING)

 - Police! - Hold it! - Hey, what's new, kid? - No, nothing, man. Here's the paper for you. Good morning, Miss Pitz, Miss Bolgard. How are you today? Very good. Have a nice day. Those guys better flip me a finsky. I just saved their truck from getting a double-parking ticket. Didn't the Gradys just buy a load of new furniture? The Gradys didn't mention about picking up any furniture. So, what's that, big news they don't tell us something? Guys must be okay, they had the key. - Here you go, without mustard. - Thanks. We got a 10-21 on East 32nd. All right.

 What are you so happy about? So, what'd you buy, shoes? No, I went to my favorite Italian deli, 9th Avenue. Mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan. What is this? I am making cannelloni this weekend. - From scratch? - Sure. Who's the lucky guy? Come on. I don't know yet. (HUMMING) What is with you? You know, I told you that Harv is ahead of schedule on that Norris Boutique job. - Yeah. - He's gonna get a bonus. He's really been knocking them dead lately, hasn't he? Yeah. And he's got that job at Far Rockaway doing the kitchen, so he's gonna surprise me with something. - Oh, Mrs. Lacey. - Yeah. And I know what it is, too. What? Something I've been wanting for years. Yeah? A new refrigerator. I want the kind with two doors. 22.2 cubic feet, side by side. In California avocado. Automatic icemaker. Outside mount on the cold water tap. Odor-resistant, porcelain-on-steel interior and a "keep it fresh" meat pan. - Sounds romantic as hell. - Oh, wait a minute. No, you don't understand. This is the kind of thing that makes a marriage. I understand. I knew a guy once who gave me an electric can opener. - It did not last. - The guy or the can opener? I burned out the motor. If Isbecki and La Guardia are already here, why does Samuels want us here, too? I don't know. He said this one was unusual. What's unusual about a burglary? They break into your apartment, they steal your money and your jewels and your videocassette recorder, and they split. (DOORBELL DINGING) (WHISTLES) They left the fireplace. (MEN CHATTERING) This one's nice, but I want something heavier. What are you talking about? That's solid gold. You're talking heavier, you're talking expensive. That's not a consideration. I want her to have the best. - All right, what? - Not this one. This guy, he's got the same eyebrows, but that's all. And this guy looks just like that guy I was in the third grade with. Oh, look at this guy. - What? - Look at this guy, right here. - What, does he look like one of them? - No. But look at that face. That guy has got to be an axe murderer, at least. Mr. Delapioli, maybe it would be better if we took you upstairs to see our sketch artist, Raul. - Okay. Maybe that'd be better. - Yeah. Right. It's right over there. Just upstairs. It's a beauty, isn't it? It's for Lauren. She's a little young for that, isn't she? She's going to be four months old tomorrow. She's very bright. Well, in that case it's perfect. Yeah, only I can't quite seem to get it to work. You've got the batteries in wrong. Give me. Give me. I'll show you. (BOTH LAUGHING) - It's a present for my daughter, Lauren. - Yeah. Make sure you wash it off before you give it to her. Now, come on, let's get to work. I wanna nip this thing in the bud. Those despicable creeps, they get a lot of chutzpah. I'd hate to see what would happen to them if they get cornered. Lab guys come up with some reports, so maybe, maybe we will be able to make some arrests. LA GUARDIA: That's Mrs. Grady, the victim. Her daughter's crippled. - SAMUELS: Hell of a thing, isn't it? - This is Mrs. Grady. Come home from a funeral and find your house robbed. At first I thought I was in the wrong apartment. They took everything. I've never had anything like this happen before. There's a first time for everything. I gave them a list of the apartment... Oh, thank you. But I keep thinking of more and more things that were stolen. That's understandable, Mrs. Grady. We have your 61 file here which can be revised. We'd be happy to make copies for your insurance company. We don't have insurance. I guess I was supposed to take care of that. I guess I let it lapse. Stop blaming yourself. This is as much my father's fault as it is hers. Please, Jerri. I'm sure it's nobody's fault. These things just happen. Oh, great. A mediator. Mrs. Grady, I understand you lost your mother. My condolences. And I'm sorry about this burglary. Not as sorry as I am. They stole my bike. Yeah. We've got it right here. It's a 10-speed Monarch. Here's the owner's manual, and the serial number's inside. Good. The more information, the better. Not many people even think to keep this stuff. Yeah. Well, I like to read it. - Do you know what color the bike is? - No. It's red. And it has a bulb horn. How long have you been a detective? Eleven months. Can you find my bike? Well, Detectives Cagney and Lacey, they'll be on the case. - Please find my bike. - We'll do our best. We know you will. Thank you. You're welcome. - That's an angry young lady. - Kid wants her bike back. Her mother said she was hit by a car two years ago. And she's been in a wheelchair ever since. - Is she permanently disabled? - They don't know. The doctors and nurses where she goes for therapy are the ones who gave her the bike. Shall we put that in the 61 form? They said she would ride that bike, and her condition improved. Hey, don't look at me like that. That's what the doctors said. They can't explain it. They're just grateful. They say it is the bike. I tell you, it's just not right. No, Christine, it's not right, it stinks. Sometimes I really hate the bad guys. Chris, remember you asked me about a gold unicorn once? I thought you might be interested in this kangaroo. Cancellation. I could get it for you for a good price. You got a bike? I suppose I could have one made up. It might be expensive, though. No, I mean a real bicycle, a 10-speed. Yeah, I could get one wholesale. I got one for Cosetti. I want this one. In red. - It's not cheap. It's for the kid, huh? - Yeah. - Let's do it. - Christine. Come on. So her parents could afford it. Let's do it. Who do you think you're gonna get to go along with this? Hey, guys. We're all gonna chip in and we're gonna buy the kid a new bike. - ISBECKI: We are? - Yeah, right now, what do you say? CAGNEY: Come on. PETRIE: That's a great idea. CAGNEY: Thanks, Petrie. All right. LA GUARDIA: All right, put me down. Great, La Guardia. Lubin, what're you waiting for, change? Hey, Isbecki, show off for me, come on. - Here, if you need any more, let me know. - Thanks. Never say I never. Mary Beth, you will sleep better tonight. What is this? Another horse tip from Isbecki's hairstylist? What'd I tell you about gambling in here? We're taking up a collection to buy Jerri Grady a new bicycle. That's nice. - It's very nice. - Thanks, Lieutenant. What are you guys doing out here? - Lubin got the bike. - Oh, yeah? It's in a box, Lubin. Who's going to put it together? Somebody explain to her about buying wholesale. - You tell her. - She's gonna be here in one hour. With some help, I'll put it together. - Careful. - What would you guys do without me? You've got one hour, Isbecki. Grady burglary. I want you out in the street today. They gotta start unloading what was stolen. And I want you to stay on top of this, you understand? Now, make sure you make this seat good and tight, will you, Isbecki? Bert, I have an animal lover on the telephone. - He insists on talking to you. - About what? About the guy with the 37 rats in the two-room apartment. - Line 4. - Thanks. Yeah, Lieutenant Samuels. No, the rats will not be destroyed. They're gonna be taken to some animal shelter where they'll be put up for adoption. Any number of people'd adopt a rat. Gordon Lee, what do I know? I'll talk to you later, babe. Christine. Are you sure that this is all right? - Yeah, I'll cover for you if you're late. - Fantastic. - You're doing it again. - What? That grin. Oh, well, that's because it's tomorrow. The reason that he wants me to get in late is because he's gonna surprise me with the refrigerator tomorrow. (YAWNS) That's exciting. You know the trouble with you? You don't know what real romance is. Oh, big "D." - Have you got those... - Nice. - That property list I needed? - Very nice. The bike thing's got a real human-interest feel to it. LACEY: Human interest? Is that what you're concerned with, Mr. Daniels? Well, the Department's been getting so much bad publicity lately, I figured people never get to hear about the good things like what you're doing for Jerri Grady. I know that as a mother you can relate to that situation. - And I can't, is that it? - It was her idea. It was something that we all decided to do. - Together. - Exactly. - Exactly, a group effort. That's even better. - This group's got some work to do. Hey, guys. She's here. Isbecki, ditch it. Detective Cagney. Oh, thanks for coming by, Jerri. - Have you heard anything about my bike? - Better than that. There it is, we found it. What happened to my horn? Must have fallen off the bike. My bike had white tape on the handlebars. This isn't my bike. Of course this is your bike, we... All right, it isn't your bike. But it's exactly the same bike. Look, it's the same make, the same model. Except the horn. - So we'll get you another horn. - And the tape. - And we will get you some tape. - This isn't my bike. There's only one bike I want, and that was the one that was stolen. I wish you had devoted your time to that. "A" for effort, Christine. Smart kid. So what did you want to try and fool her for? Who said, "No good deed goes unpunished"? I think it was the same guy that said, "Enough is enough." You got the paperwork on that aggravated assault? What was that Anti Crime guy's name that we met at P.J. Clarke's? The one that wanted to take you home, with the Porsche? - Branketell. - Officer Branketell, please. - Why? - He works Central Park. They got that squad that, you know... Stolen bikes. - Oh, Christine, you're wasting your time. - Hey, it's a phone call. Hey, you two, uniform just found the furniture, it was dumped in Brooklyn. In a park off the Belt Parkway, check it out. We're on our way. - Come on. - Coming. I'm coming. Just put it over there. Oh, no, that looks like a grass stain. It is a grass stain, Mrs. Grady. They dumped the furniture in a park. They only kept what was easily hawkable. Somebody got the license plate number of the truck. It was stolen two weeks ago. Yeah. Well, we could have figured that one. Hi. The doorman said they got our stuff back. - Just the furniture, honey. - Anything of Grandma's? They haven't found everything yet, sweetheart. And none of the important stuff like my bike? I guess it's not police priority. Excuse me, young lady. We are doing our best to recover everything that was stolen. Mary Beth. We'll be in touch. Cut that out, huh? You got everything? Michael, zip up your jacket. - It's not cold. - It's not cold in here. Outside it's too chilly in the morning and if you get a cold, Michael, I'll kill you. That I'd like to see. Mom, he's got a runny nose, shoot him. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hold it. Here. Honey, honey, I got it, okay? - Come on, guys, let's go. - Look after your brother. - All right, Mom. - Okay, be careful crossing the street, huh? All right, Dad. - Who's this lady here? - This is a friend of your mother's. - See you guys. - All right, Dad. Bye. HARVEY: Come in, please. - Mrs. Wall, this is my wife, Mary Beth. - LACEY: Hello. Mrs. Wall is gonna do the cleaning for you, once a week. - She is? - Yeah. I didn't tell her about you, it's kind of a surprise. - How many bedrooms? - Two, there's ours and the kids'. And one bathroom. - And no dishwasher? - No. I understand you have Tuesdays free. Tuesday is a good day for us. Thursday. It's the only day I have free is Thursday. Thursday? Thursday is a good day for us, too. Isn't it, honey? - Thursday's fine. - Yeah. Tomorrow is Thursday, you wanna start next week? No, I'll start tomorrow. Where do you keep your cleaning supplies? Over here, right down here. We've got lots of cleaning things. Don't use any of that stuff. Well, if I'm gonna start tomorrow, I gotta have a few things. Now, is 8:00 tomorrow morning okay? - Fine. - 8:00 is fine. Listen, take anything you want from the refrigerator. It's a little old but still does the job. - There's leftover corned beef in there. - I'm on a low sodium diet. Well, there's eggs, then. - Tuna? - Well, if it's packed in water. Tuna in water, I'll pick some... Could I... I'll pick it up for you. Tuna in water. Thank you. Here you go. - So, we'll see you tomorrow, then? - Yeah. 8:00 in the morning. Okay? Tomorrow, Thursday, huh? - Yeah, 8:00. - Okay, Mrs. Wall. Thank you very much, see you tomorrow. MRS. WALL: Kids? HARVEY: Yeah. We just hired our first cleaning lady. Nice woman. - You're surprised, right? - Yeah. - Hold on a minute. - Yeah, what can I do for you? Look, I checked. Mr. Gibbon didn't leave a note saying he was expecting anyone. I'm Mr. Gibbon's nephew, Patrick. I guess with the funeral and all, he forgot. I'd be at the funeral myself, only, as you know, my aunt's taken the death of her father very hard. Yeah, I know. My uncle asked me to remove all of her father's things. Why? So that when they return from the funeral, the old memories wouldn't be there to remind her. Well, they didn't tell me. That's why they left me the key and asked that I do this. I see. - If you need any help... - That's very nice of you, but we'll be out of here before you know it. Here it is. "Charles Gibbon, beloved father of Mary, Wanda and Nancy. "Funeral and burial service at..." List today's date. "Hillside Cemetery, Queens." And I got the same thing for the Grady family. The obit listed time and place of the funeral services. I'm telling you, they're maggots. People buy these papers, see who dies and then they rip off the family. My phone's been ringing off the hook. The newspapers picked up the story that Daniels gave them about the kid and the bicycle. Everybody wants to donate a bike. Did you call a uniform to have their canvassing report - sent over from the first stolen van? - I'm working on it. That ought to have been on my desk this morning, Cagney. You're spending too much time on this bicycle thing. I'm on it, I'm on it. What, the kid won't accept any of the bike offers? No, she turned them all down, sir. She wouldn't even accept one from her mother. Look, speaking of bikes, there's a sergeant at 16 says he'll take the one we bought off our hands for 60 bucks. - I say we take it, cut our losses. - Well, for 60 bucks, I'll take it. - For Lauren. - Baby Lauren? Wait a minute, let me get this straight. You're buying a 10-speed bike - for Lauren who's four months old. - Yeah. - I've got lots of closet space. - That was uniform. You hear? Some kids turned in a velvet-lined box, the kind that you put sterling silver in? On the outside of the box, family name was engraved, Grady. Now, you two go on over there, pick up that box, see if it belongs to the Gradys. - We may be getting close to these guys. - Okay. Hi. We found your mom's silver box. Another great landmark in your brilliant police career. How'd you do it? Some kids were playing in the park and they found it, turned it in. Very impressive. Maybe someone will ride my bike right into the station. Lord knows, you could have your pick. There have been enough offers. Yeah, well, maybe I'll take them all and hawk them. You know, you got a mouth on you, kid. Makes up for my legs. Now, don't do that. You wanna play, then let's play fair. You're not my grandma. She's the only one that could talk to me like that. She wouldn't let you get away with this crap either. You know, you talk a lot like her. Must have gone to the same school together. That's funny. I used to love these things about a hundred years ago. Yeah, well, I hate them. Maybe I shouldn't expect to get my bike back. What should I do? Just sit around and mope all day like my mother? - I'm not gonna settle. - And nobody's asking you to. Lord knows I never did when I was your age. Still don't. - Then you know what I mean. - Sure I do. It's just that when you start hitting your 30s, all that coolness and all that armor gets a little heavy to carry around. And it becomes more difficult to change even if you wanted to. - You know what I mean? - Is this your way of telling me that the New York City Police Department has given up looking for my bike? Nobody is giving up looking for your bike. The doctor said I would ride that bike. Something to shoot for, understand? Yeah. Mrs. Grady says the silver was custom made in England by an A.V. Bartell, some kind of big deal silversmith. - That ought to help. - Great. - Are you with me here? - Yeah, I'm listening. You haven't been listening all week. I'm carrying the load here. I'm sorry. That kid keeps giving you a hard time, and you keep coming back for more. Let me tell you something, the kid lost her grandmother. Her own mother, for all intents and purposes, is a basket case. That bike is the one thing she's got that means something to her, Mary Beth. - She feels like she's lost everything. - She hasn't lost everything, Christine. What is happening to her is called grief. She's gotta work her way through it. There's no way you can wave a magic wand and make it all better. She likes me a lot. Okay. We've got Bartell Silver to check out. Let's do it. LACEY: I like you, too. What is all that junk? This is not junk. These are cleaning supplies. The same junk we have under the sink. It's not the same, those are special things requested by the cleaning lady. Now, you finish your breakfast, she's going to be here any minute. Oh, Lord! I forgot the plastic garbage bags. What about the brown paper bags we get from the supermarket? We got a whole drawer full of them, there. - Two drawers. - Mrs. Wall requested plastic garbage bags. She'll live. Is the laundry in the hamper? Did you take all those papers off your desk? - Yeah. - You check under the bed for socks? Found three. They were all Harvey's. Were not! Are we going to have to do the dishes, too? Shut up and eat your breakfast. You're sure that was... Are you sure that it was Felix Sperling? Right. Okay, thank you. That's another one. Petrie, we got another one. Apartment burglary, only this time the doorman in the building didn't buy their story. He's at Roosevelt Hospital with a concussion. La Guardia's there. That's a new twist. Anything like that in the MO file? I don't know, I haven't had the chance to look at it. I'll check it out for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Listen, one of my informants told me he knows where a lot of stolen bikes have ended up. - Oh, yeah? - I was telling Lubin this. And Peter says maybe he can get some ink on it. Peter. Ink? Exactly, what do you mean by ink? Simply that the press just about devoured the last story we gave them on this bike thing. I don't think I'd be overstating it if I said that we could get front page metro section, maybe even with art, if we can give them a story about you breaking the bike thing. I could have reporters on the scene. In the first place, Mr. Daniels, we don't even know for a fact that the bike is even there. That's not the point, don't you see? It doesn't make any difference. You would be the angle of the story. - Me. - DANIELS: Of course. Oh, I see. You mean like, "Fem cop finds bike for kid in wheelchair." It's not bad. Go to hell. Cagney, Lacey, in here. I'm checking Sperling, one minute. Will you two come on? What's Lacey doing? - Did you brief her on the latest burglary? - Yes, sir. Well, I want the two of you to get over there. - The victims were Ron and Ethel Perlman. - Yeah, I know that. They were at funeral services for Ron's father when their apartment was burglarized. I know, it's in the newspapers, it's in the obituary section. - The time and the place, the whole thing. - It was not published in the newspapers. That's my point. So, we were wrong. The obituary column is not the common link. In the two previous burglaries, the Gradys and Gibbons had different funeral directors. But they were both serviced by the same mortician. Felix Sperling. And the latest victims, the Perlmans? - Lacey's checking it right now. - Funeral director, Steven Aubert and Sons, his mortician, Felix Sperling. - See? - And there's one more thing. All three deaths occurred in the house. Okay, okay. So that means that in other words, the mortician would send someone over there to pick up the body - and he would case the place, is that it? - That's what we think. Yeah. And they would all come back and burglarize the place on the day of the funeral. - Yes, sir. - That's nice, that's nice. Now we're getting someplace. - You're doing good work, the both of you. - Thank you, sir. - Yeah. - I have to meet Inspector Marquette at lunch and I just want you to know, I think Detective Cagney is missing an opportunity to do herself and the Department some good. What? I think you should get into this, Lieutenant. What was all that about? Isbecki got a tip on a place that sells hot bicycles. This guy wants me to show up there and prance around like some show horse for the press. I'm not gonna do it. But why doesn't he use Isbecki? They're playing it up as a woman's story, sir. So? The implication seems to be that women are always sentimental and men never are, nor could they ever be. Look, I would like to find this kid her bike, but this is asking too much of me. It's guys like that that turn everything around. I'm off of it. Sir. - DANIELS: Lieutenant. - Yeah. Did you get through to her? Look, didn't you hear what she said? She is not interested, so lay off! Okay, sports fans, the plan's been approved. We're in business. Petrie, get me Daley over at the Medical Examiner's office. If we're wrong about this, make sure your uniforms are pressed. Yeah, Daley. - He's here. - Samuels here. Listen, I need a body, a fresh one. Someone, say, in their 70s. No, no. Not days old, hours old. District Attorney will give you whatever papers you need. Okay, thanks. - They have a body? - Nothing in stock, but they'll let us know as soon as one gets in. Chris. I do not like the idea of using a real body. The Feds do this all the time. That's how they make cases. Listen, I went to the bike place on my own. - I didn't find the kid's bike there. - Thanks, Isbecki. I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble. Shouldn't have opened my mouth in front of Daniels. It's not your fault, the man is an insensitive son of a... Careful. Creep. Let's face it, sensitive guys are few and far between. I'm gonna need some volunteers to go down to the morgue, do the paper work and sign for the body as soon as it comes in. - I would prefer not to, sir. - Why not? Because a corpse is still a person, and I think it should be respected. Look, if it makes you a little queasy, I'll go. It doesn't make me queasy, Victor. I think it's disrespectful. I'll go anyway. Mr. Sensitive. - Who's there? - It's me, Mrs. Wall. (GASPS) Jeez, the floor is wet. All right, come in. This floor, it's got so many spots on it that don't come out, I was using bleach and steel wool. You need a new linoleum. Yeah. It's an old floor. It's almost as old as the refrigerator. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I don't usually come home in the middle of the day. But something came up, I gotta change clothes. Well, if you're gonna get dressed, I'll work in another room. Oh, well, that's... No, it's all right. Go ahead with your work. That's my service revolver. I'm a Detective with the Police Department. - Here, this is my badge. - I don't like guns. Well, it's just part of my work. I mean, tool of the trade. Excuse me. - Oh, this looks great in here. - I haven't been in there. CAGNEY: I love sterling, don't you? - What is taking them so long, Christine? - Would you relax? They'll be here. - Petrie, any sign of them yet? - PETRIE: Negative. This was a mistake. We should not have placed the call to the funeral director until we had a body here. Now we got a mortician's helper on his way and no body to give him. Would you calm down? They're probably just stuck in traffic. This is going well. You're looking very bereaved. That's another thing. How come I have to be the bereaved niece and you get to be the neighbor? Because you're so good at it. Besides, I don't have a black dress. What about that one you wore to Janice Kirschfeld's wedding? It's strapless. PETRIE: Isbecki and La Guardia are on their way up. 10-4, thank you. Wonder what he looks like. I don't care what he looks like. I don't want to look at him. Come on, aren't you just a teensy bit curious, huh? No, I am not. All right, get... Come on in here. What happened to you guys? Did you get stuck in traffic? It was murder. I told him not to take 6th Avenue. That's not why we're late. Uncle Charlie here showed up in nothing but his hospital gown. We had to stop and buy him pajamas. - What do you think? - Very nice. Would you two hurry up and get out of here? They could be here any minute. Why don't you help me put his pajamas on, we'll get him to bed. First bedroom on the right. Those are good-looking pajamas, how much did they cost? He looks like he could be an Uncle Charlie. PETRIE: There are two of them on their way up. Lacey, are you there? Two on their way up. Lacey, do you read me? 10-4, we are set. (DOORBELL DINGS) - Miss McGinty? - Yes. John Trainer. Steven Aubert and Sons authorized me to pick up the remains of the deceased. - Oh, yes, come in. - Thank you. - They told me to expect Mr. Sperling. - Yes, I work for him. - My sympathies. - Thank you. He's in the first bedroom on the right. The doctor told me you would need a death certificate. I'll pass that along. - I need your signature. - Oh, yes. Thank you. (DOORBELL DINGING) Excuse me. Oh, my God. I just heard. I am so sorry. Yeah, well. What can you do? I mean, he passed away in the middle of the night. How's your husband taking it? As well as can be expected under the circumstances. He's with his sister. He wanted to break the news to... Now, have you made funeral arrangements? - Yes, day after tomorrow. - So soon? Yes, that's the way that Uncle Charlie wanted it. Sooner the better, he always said. It's Holy Cross Cemetery in Brooklyn. 11:00, and there's a mass at 9:30 in the... Before. You know we'll be there. Would you like me to take any of his clothes? A suit or a tuxedo, perhaps? Maybe, maybe, why don't you wait and talk to the funeral director later? Later, later would be good. Yeah, later is better because I'd like to talk to my husband first. Of course, no problem. Thank you very much. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - We did it. - What, "So soon?" - What? - What, you want to blow the whole thing? Oh, come on. I was terrific, you're the one who almost blew it. Debatable. So, you think they're gonna rip this place off or not? Yes, I do. Maybe we can get the kid back her bike. I thought you weren't interested anymore. I'm not. Petrie, we're in business. They're on their way down. - LACEY: Honey, you all set? - Yeah, ready. Okay, now. For Harvey Lacey, master builder, for the successful, ahead-of-schedule completion of Norris Boutique. Careful, they're hot. All right, very quickly, right now... Oatmeal cookies never tasted this good. - Where'd you come up with the idea? - Christine. Give me a bite. Where did you get this? French, huh? Well, for you, why not? Honey? You remember last year when you and the kids gave me that straw pocketbook for Mother's Day? - The one with the embroidered rose on it? - That's the one. Remember, I was feeling kind of funny about returning it because I didn't want to hurt your feelings? No, it was just a nice purse, that's all. You didn't hurt my feelings. Well, you said you were disappointed. I was a little, but I wasn't hurt. - It's the thought that counts, right? - Yeah, it's in the giving, not what it is. I fired the maid today. Well, it wasn't working out. I mean, the kitchen floor does sparkle and all but... Between getting ready for her and then fixing things the way I like them after, it really... It wasn't saving me any time. I don't think that I have the right temperament for domestic help. (SIGHS) You know, you work so hard. And now that I'm doing better, finally, I just wanted to make things easier for you, that's all. - You mad? - I'm not mad. You're disappointed. - You're hurt? - No. - More champagne? - No. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Well, nobody told me anything. I guess, what with the confusion of the funeral, they forgot. My boss told me that Mr. McGinty wanted his uncle's things removed. Because the memory of them would be too painful. He left the key. - It's apartment 9A. - Yeah, thanks. They're on their way up, do you read? We read, 10-4. - Easy. - Yeah. CAGNEY: Bird dog transmitter is in place. You're getting anything? Works like a charm. The whole thing is in progress right now, sir. All right, Lacey, take it easy. I'm on my way. You can reach me on the car radio. Okay. Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. That's it, guys, take us right to your warehouse. - We move as soon as the doors are open. - Let's try and get in at the same time. - There's only four of us. - Correction, five of us. And I got some uniformed backup. I don't want to blow this. Go. (SIREN WAILING) - Police, get out! - Hold it right there! You, get out. - PETRIE: Come on. - Let's go, hands up. - On the hood, let's go! - Okay, line up. Up against the truck, come on. ISBECKI: Okay, Morris, Flannigan, keep them covered. - I'll check the bins. - CAGNEY: Spread them. - Isbecki, look over there. - ISBECKI: Is this everything? I want to see all your merchandise. You understand? PETRIE: What I'm looking for has got two wheels, I better find it. LACEY: I don't see it, Chris, it's not here. - Nice, did you get it off a client? - Look, it's over. You got us. Where's the rest of the stuff? You show me. - What is it you want? - A girl's red bicycle. What? We ain't got it. That stuff goes fast. - You all right? - Yeah. My mother said you wanted to see me. How is she? She's happy, the jewelry and the family silver was all recovered. - It means a lot to her. - Good. We were hoping we'd be able to recover your bike as well. The truth is, we are never gonna find it. It's gone, it's probably been repainted or shipped off to another state for all we know. We tried, Jerri. All of us did. Is that why you asked me here? That, and we'd like to offer you another bike. CAGNEY: This came in this morning. LACEY: It's from a dealer in Jersey. Abe Brockman, Brockman cycles, Paramus, New Jersey. - He even threw in a warranty. - It's good for two years. Anything goes wrong with the bike, he'll fix it. No charge. You guys must be reading my mind. All I do at home is exercise. I need a bike around. - Give me something... - Something to shoot for. Yeah. Well, you can't have a bike without a bulb horn. (HONKS) They say it's very fast. You'll let us know, huh? Yeah, I will. Thanks. Victor, you want to help the young lady? So, what, do you think today is a holiday? Come on, haven't you got some work to do?
