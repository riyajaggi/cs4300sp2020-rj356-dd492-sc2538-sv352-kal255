 By the way, I've been telling my brother about you, Christine, and he's dying to meet you. Oh, gee, La Guardia... Listen, he's having a party. Great food, a lot of drink... - Oh, no, and I'm busy. - ...pretty interesting people. Christine, he's a great guy. Oh, I know he's a great guy, La Guardia. It's just that I can't make it tonight. But it's not tonight. It's tomorrow night. I can't make it then, either. It's La Guardia again. I can't believe you're ducking out on his brother. How many men have you met who own their own plane? Six. I'll tell you what. Give me a blonde wig. I'll go.

 He's really... He's a sweet guy. I know he's a sweet guy. It doesn't have anything to do with him. I just don't feel like going out with anybody right now. You've found someone. Who is he? To tell you the truth, I have not been on a date in several weeks. What have you been doing with yourself? I beg your pardon? I happen to like being alone. I like the quiet. It cleanses the system. LACEY: Hey, you gave up smoking. Yeah, three times. You don't think I can do it, do you? I didn't say anything. I'll tell you, I'm tired of the games and the one night stands, so I'm just off that track, and I'm no longer in that running. That's easy to say when there's nobody else in the race. - Lacey. - Sir. Come here. - This is Detective Lacey. - Here. This is Mr. Waits. He's here from Vermont, and he's lost his wife. I'm sorry. I didn't lose her. Something happened. We'll try and take care of it, sir. Right this way. Chris. Hi, Lynne. I saw your story today on the monty games. It was good stuff. Thanks. What you got there? Missing persons. You interested? See you around. WAITS: Edward Waits. - W-A... - I-T-S. - Who's she? - Detective Cagney. - Hello. - Edward Waits. My wife's sick. Bad. Something to do with her blood. Too many cells. She's been taking treatments at this hospital, St. Matthews. Not staying. An outpatient. I went there to find her. They said she'd never been admitted. - Does she have an apartment here? - I've been already. She's disappeared. Something happened. Well, sir, we don't really call someone a missing person until they've been gone 72 hours. How long have you been looking? Three days. Next time, ask the question before you tell the rules. I'll remember that. They did something. Something went wrong at that hospital, and the doctors don't want anybody to know. Is it possible you went to the wrong place? I'm not a fool. I'm not crazy or whatever you think. It happened. You're gonna do something about it, or I have to myself? Just let me know. I don't have time... I will take care of it, sir, but I'm gonna need some information. Her name is Julie Carson Waits. - C-A-R... - S-O-N. - I got a picture. - Good. Lovely. No Julie Waits in here. I told you, the guy was psycho. Try Carson. Carson. Could there be some kind of mistake in the records? Oh, anything's possible. Once in a while, we misplace somebody, but they turn up sooner or later, you know? No, no Carson. She's being treated by a Dr. Joseph Altman. Yeah, he's affiliated here. Where do we find him? - She was here from Vermont? - Yeah. - It's unlikely she'd come to me. - Why? I'm not that good. I'm competent. I'm a good doctor, but I'm not somebody you'd travel that far to see. What was I supposed to be treating her for? Blood disorder. - That's impossible. - Why? I'm an ophthalmologist. Excuse me. - Larry, hi. Two, fast. - Sorry. So what do you think? The old guy's wife ran out on him? That's how it looks, doesn't it? Who're you smiling at? - Oh, hi, Christine. - Hello. - Excuse me. Sorry. Hi. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi. Mary Beth Lacey. Father Geller. John, please. It makes people less nervous. - You're a priest? - I'm a priest. I'm Frank. Oh, it's nice to meet you. We just stopped by after the youth center's basketball game. - Oh, how'd you do? - It was not a victory dinner. Well, we're improving, though, ever since Frank joined us. Miss Cagney, your table's ready. Oh, we're next. We're next. It was a pleasure to have met you. Indeed. I hope I get to see you again sometime. Thank you. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Bye, Father. - Bye-bye. Pardon me. Thank you. - I wish my priest looked like that. - You don't have a priest. I would if he looked like that. Yeah, he was gorgeous. Just what I went through when I quit smoking. Couldn't pass up a pack of cigarettes without wanting to grab it. Mary Beth, come on. The man is a priest. - What're you getting so jumpy about? - I'm not... Just behave yourselves. I'm in no mood. (PHONE RINGING) Detective Lacey, 14th. Oh, yeah. Sure. She's right here. Detective Cagney. Oh, hi. No. No, no, I don't mind Father John giving you my number. I don't understand. You're not a priest? He's not a priest... Well, it was just a natural assumption. Come on. I'm not a "cop" cop. I'm a detective. Well, I don't know. It's up to you. Well, if you like. Yeah. Okay. Sure. All right, I will. All right, bye. So he's gorgeous, and he's not a priest. Did he ask you out? He gave me his number, okay? Well, did you tell him that you would go out with him? Did you hear the word "yes" pass from these lips? I didn't hear the word "no," either. Are you gonna go... Are you gonna go out with him or not? - I swore off, remember? - I certainly do. What's she up to now? - Who? - Donna Moline, or whatever she's calling herself. You know her? Business acquaintance. I haven't seen her in a few years. She's looking good. When I was still in uniform, I collared her a couple of times. - For what? - Prostitution. - What have you got? - Donna Moline. Born June 16, 1955. Runaway, August, '68. Prostitution, January '73. Prostitution... The parents are in Brooklyn, Park Slope. The last collar was a little over five years ago. - WAITS: Detective Lacey. - Oh, Lord. You wanna tell him? Did you find her? - Good morning, Ed. - Did you find her? Well, Mr. Waits, it's not that easy. Sit down. Don't give me any excuses. Did you go to that hospital like I told you? Yes, sir. She was never there. They have no record of her on file. Dr. Altman never saw her, either. He's lying. I've been getting his bills for two years. - Did you pay them? - Of course. Julie sends me copies of his bills. I send her checks to pay him. I don't care about the money. I just want my girl well. Yeah, we know. She's sick. Bad. She tried to hide it from me in her letters, but last week she sent me a copy of her will. Her will? She said it was time we started thinking about these things. She told me to send her a copy of my will, too. I'd already left her everything. Sir, was she aware of this? That's not what she wanted. She was just trying to keep me from worrying, but I saw through. My girl's dying. I've got to find her. We'll find her for you. You gave us that home address. But she uses her maiden name there. She'd lived there before, and she said it'd be cheaper if they didn't know she'd gotten married. Some kind of law. Do you have a phone number? She didn't have one. She said it was a waste of money. Lacey. Let us check it out. Hey, you two. We'll be right back. What's going on over there? The missing person, the man from Vermont. - Come on, you finished that... - We haven't found her yet. And you're not going to. Guy married a hooker. She skipped on him. Sir, he doesn't know. Well, tell him. Let him go back home. You two got more than a dozen cases between the two of you. We'll manage. Do you think we're doing this because we feel sorry for him? I'm not thinking about it at all. I want you off. There is money involved, probable fraud. Oh, you wanna get down to cash, huh? How about the $400,000 brownstone arson? We're working on that. Right, that, not this. Now, wrap it up and get going. Now! Yeah. Samuels. What? Yes or no? How do you feel about skipping lunch? Yeah, he came in yesterday. He was real upset about something, too, his wife. What kind of accent was that he had? - Vermont. - Vermont. Okay, I gotta remember that, in case I get a part sometime. I can use it. - You're an actor? - For sure. We all are. Here it is. Here she is. Julie Carson. No alternate address or telephone number. No? Well, that's weird. They usually do. What is this "MO" in the corner? Money Order. It's how she pays her bills. But she uses your number for her answering service? Yeah. Yeah, you can't even get a mailbox here unless you do. She never gets any messages, though. How do you know? I listen. Well, you see, most people here, they just take messages, and that's it. Now, I observe, and not just accents, either. Life. See, there's a lot of life passing through my ears here. Would you check the box, see if there's anything else? Oh, sorry. No. No, her box is empty. Is there any way you can tell when the last pickup was made? Nope. Boy, we got a real mystery here, don't we? - Yeah. - See? What did I tell you? Life. Thank you. Actors. I haven't seen my daughter in six, eight years. Can you tell us where Donna is now? I wish I could, but... Well, I understand the past is so hard to leave and... Well, I don't even know her married name. She never said. When did you talk to her? I got a letter from her. It was Christmas before last. She married a very nice man from New England, and she even sent me a picture of the wedding. Yes. She looks fine, doesn't she? People can change, you know? It's hard to imagine Donna living out in the country. She loved New York so much. I mean, that's why she ran away. It's the city and... If she hadn't met those people... Well, it's all past now. Do you still have the letter? I must have thrown that out with the cards. Isn't that silly? What'd I tell you two this morning? We did this on our lunch hour. On your lunch hour? Four hours? Behind my back? All right, but it paid off, didn't it? I mean, look at it. We're talking possible bigamy, fraud. Don't you throw things at me. Yeah, we're talking a lot of possibilities here. How about facts, huh? This case has maybe a 20% solvability. Maybe. Assuming there's a case here at all. You begged me for the arson assignment. Well, you're off this, and if I ever hear about this again or if I ever find out that the two of you didn't drop it... Do I have to finish my sentence? All right. Thanks for your cooperation. I don't mind it when he yells. When he's cute, I can't stand it. What? What? - Hi, how's it going? - Terrible. Hey, you two gonna have anything new for me on the arson before deadline? Oh, I wish we could. We had a great story for... Would she have been perfect to write it? I was just thinking the same thing. Too bad. Why? Who'd you give it to? Nobody. It's just there's not a story anymore. Samuels made us drop the case. - What was it? - Real human-interest stuff. Old man comes to New York, looking for his sick wife, who's disappeared, and that's just the beginning. I have exclusive? You would, except now there's no story. So I don't know. Stick around. Don't look. Don't look. Girls, can I see you a minute, please? Sir. Interesting thing about this missing-persons case. Seems that Lynne Sutter agrees with you. Matter of fact, she's threatening to write an alternate story on the heartlessness of the police turning away from this poor old man, refusing to help. I guess you're back on it. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. By the way, she says she's gonna start running the story in the Sunday edition, no matter what its status. But she can't do that. If it gets out we're working on this, Donna Moline will go underground and blow the whole thing we just started. Yeah, I told her that, but she doesn't seem to care. I guess you two got your work cut out for you, don't you? Anything else? Yeah, I've been going over your DD5s for the past few weeks, and they're not very complete. That's the way we've always done those forms. That's the way everybody does them. Well, I want you to do them again for the whole past month, and I want them in by tomorrow morning. Oh, come on, Lieutenant. Lacey's already got to drive up to Connecticut tonight to find that photographer. - Me? - Well, I've sort of got a date. (PERSIAN MUSIC PLA YING) I can't get away with anything anymore. You know what I mean? What have we got here? Thank you. You're really into this stuff, huh? - I am a certified adventurer. - Yes? How about yourself? Sure. Listen, I had a chance to drive to Connecticut tonight, - but Mary Beth won the toss. - Mary Beth? Yeah, we work together. You met her the other night in the bar. Oh, right. So... Basketball scholarship, first marriage, volunteer work at the youth center, art director. What else? Sheets. Sheets? Sheets. I just designed and sold an original watercolor for a sheet manufacturer. What's so funny? Nothing. Excuse me. Nothing. There's absolutely nothing funny about sheets. - Where did you get this? - From your wife's mother. She didn't know your name, but I traced the photographer. He remembered you. Now, why are you lying to me? I'm not. My wife had no family. Her parents died when she was 10. Sir, it would help if I could ask you just a few questions first. - Is she all right? - Yes, sir, as far as I know. She has to be careful. She's not used to sickness. What is wrong with her? It's her blood. I think it's leukemia. I can't ask her. Who is her doctor? Altman. Joseph Altman. He's supposed to be the best. She got sick about 10 days after our wedding, and the treatments were going on and on. I believed that she was getting better when she came home this last time, but after a week or two, she was bad again. How did you and Julie meet each other? Well, it was through a personal column in one of those magazines. You know, we had never set eyes on one another until the night before our wedding, but I knew. I knew she was the one. You really didn't have to walk me home. I didn't know I was. I thought we were just walking. Yeah, the city will do that to you. I'll check on those Knicks tickets for us for tomorrow night. Good. Well... My father's sleeping. I thought you said you lived alone. I do, normally, but he's having his apartment painted, so he's staying with me. - For how long? - Oh, long as necessary. Well, - I'll talk to you tomorrow, huh? - Okay. And... Keys. - Good night. - Good night, Christine. Whose idea was this? When we told you about this story, we did not expect this kind of time pressure. No, you expected me to go to Samuels, get you what you wanted, and that would be that. Do you think I'm new at this? You know any kind of publicity now is gonna blow the whole thing. I promise, you'll get your story. Hey, I've already got it, one way or another. Good luck. - Morning, Petrie. - Good morning. - Lacey. - Sir. What happened to your DD5s? Sir, can you go easy for a little while? I know you're angry. Angry? What would I have to be angry about? Sir, I got in from Connecticut 4:00 this morning. I'm about to go and push through all the work on the mailboxes, - and I... - Tough. Tough life, huh? But at least you got an interesting case to work on. Look, I hate to lay this on you now, but after you left, I remembered about my class tonight. Oh, it's nothing. It's just something I'm taking at NYU. But how about during the day? A quick lunch... Oh, good. Robson's at 1:00? I'll see you then. Bye. Stop smiling. - He got you, huh? - Nobody got anybody. Then how come you won't see him during the night? You don't take any classes. I know it, but I wanted to watch that PBS special on Agamemnon's tomb. I would like to get to know him first. Okay. Oh, you ready for this? Sir, this man also married Julie two months after you did. Not her. Oh, come on, Ed. Sir, we realize this isn't easy. She had a hard life. She told me that right away. Her first letter. I didn't care then. I don't now. Mr. Waits, look at this. Please. Please. You can see. It's him. - Reverend Burnell. - Who? The minister who married us, her uncle. Burnell. She asked if he could perform the ceremony. He came up that morning. I didn't like him. Tried to, but he kept rushing us, like it was something we should just wanna get over with. - Wedding's a sacred thing. - Yes, sir. It's him. He's making her do these things. Ed, that is not true. Don't tell me. I lived all my life without somebody. I didn't need anyone. Until her. I was 59 when we got married. It's a long time to be alone. I could've gone on. I wasn't gonna put my faith in someone who didn't deserve it. She's my wife. None of your lies is gonna change that. Hi, Christine. Oh, sorry. I just went ahead and ordered. I hope you don't mind. - Oh, no. - I'm kind of pressed for time. No, it's fine. It's fine. I hope there's no problem. Oh, no, I have got six and one half minutes. Besides, I wanted to see you. Oh, good. Listen, I don't remember if I told you, but last night was... It was different. Well, the restaurant sure was, anyway. Do you know what I'm saying to you? Yes, I do. Well, as I said, I went ahead and ordered. Basically whatever they had prepared because the truth is, I don't know what you like to eat. I'm an adventurer, remember? That's right. Where did you say you went to school? University of Pennsylvania. Right, in Philadelphia. Right. Right. And you went there on a basketball scholarship? Is... Is everything okay? Oh, it's perfect. Why? Oh, you just seem a little nervous. Oh, no. No, no, I'm just interested. I would like to get to know you. I think we know each other pretty well. Oh. Thank you. Oh, um... Buddy Rich is playing at the Bottom Line. You wanna catch a set Thursday night? - You like jazz? - Yeah, can you go? Thursday night? Oh, gee, I can't. See, I have this thing, you know... But lunch would be good. I think they're playing through to Saturday. At night? Most nightclubs are closed during the day. Of course they are. The truth is, it's just the whole week that's bad, especially the weekends after 5:00. Julie! Julie! Back in the car. Come on, get in the car. What are you doing to her? What are you doing? I was right. He's hurting her. He took her and pushed her in the car. I tried to stop him. I gotta help her. The man is smart, and he's playing hardball. They may try to contact you again, find out how much you know, just to smooth things over. Are you listening? If they do, pretend to play their game. Do not let them know you contacted the police. All right. Whatever happens, you keep in touch with us. Don't try and handle it on your own again. Please. What are you doing here? I checked the squad room. They told me where you'd gone. What happened to Mr. Lonelyhearts? Pardon? Good headline, isn't it? Very tasteful. Oh, thank you. - Halfsies? - Sure. (EXCLAIMS) You guys got a search warrant this time, huh? Is that what that was? More or less. Listen, I got a part. I got a part in a showcase. There's no money or anything, but that's okay. Guess what I play. - I give up. - A convict. It's Hello Out There by Saroyan, and I play this young man, and he's locked in a cell, and that's why I wanted to talk to you guys. Why? I thought maybe you could lock me up overnight. You see, I'm having a little problem getting a handle on this role and... Oh, I know it's a stretch, - but you guys think you could? - No. Well, it would be very helpful just to have the experience, you know? I'm sorry. We can't do that. Could you leave us alone for a little while? Oh, sure. I understand. I don't know. Maybe you should lock him up. Listen to this. "Dear Julie, "I know you don't like me to spend our money, "but I wanted you to have this." Cash. Another one. "My dear wife, I'm glad to hear the treatments are helping. "You should have seen me smile." $200 money order in here. This one has a will and an insurance policy. Mary Beth, check this out. It's a different girl. I don't believe it. Burnell's got a corporation going. He should start issuing stock. You realize this is only what we've found so far. There could be other addresses. There may be, but this is plenty right now. - Interstate? - Yeah. - Did you call in the feds? - No, no, it's still ours. - Great. - Just how senile are these guys, anyhow? You know what you want to know. I'm putting you two on the boxes. But Lieutenant... No "buts." Watch and see if anybody picks up. Petrie, you know this Donna or Julie whoever? - Moline. - Yeah, go out on the streets and see - if you can find any of her old contacts. - No problem. Friend of yours, huh? How'd you two meet? Professionally. Mine, not hers. Girls. - You were right about this case. - Thank you, sir. You ever pull that crap behind my back again, you're gonna be sorry, even sorrier than I hope you are right now. All right. What? Frank. All of them? What is going on with you two? (PHONE RINGING) Would... Could you get that? I'm gonna get some coffee. Detective Lacey, 14th. Oh, yeah. How are you, Frank? No. No, I'm sorry. I guess you just missed her. Yeah. I have no idea, but if you want me to take a message for you, I could... Sure. Okay. Okay. Bye-bye. You want some coffee? That's a nice man. Yeah, he's very nice. Do you want coffee or not? No, thank you. Things just didn't work out, okay? I'm sorry. I told him that I didn't want to sleep with him until we got to know each other better. Sure cooled him off. Yeah, I guess that's why he's calling every five minutes. Well, I said he was a nice guy. He's just being polite. Very. You can't expect me to hop into the sack with every stranger I pick up at a bar. I don't. Well, it wasn't exactly a pickup. We were introduced, by a priest. We had a nice evening together, and a couple of terrific afternoons, I might add, but that is no reason to believe that anything could ever come of it, is it? No. So what are we arguing about? I am not arguing with you, and, as far as I can see, neither is Frank. Let's just get back to work, okay? Sure. Did he leave a message? No. Mr. Waits, this just came in a little while ago. - Forwarded from Vermont. - Thank you. Can I use your phone? - Local call? - Yeah. Go ahead. Hello? I'm calling for Julie Carson Waits. She said I should leave a message. I'm her husband. Where can we find Donna Moline? I don't know. I've barely seen her since we got off the streets. Burnell made her stay away from me after I turned him down. - They asked you to be a part of this? - It's not a bad deal. It's just he's too weird. I wouldn't be talking to you at all if I didn't owe Petrie a favor. Okay, Gwen, tell us how the scam runs. "Young woman wants to correspond with mature man." The letters come. They pick the ones with potential and start a correspondence. The men never suspect? There are a lot of lonely people. She's told him she's been sick. After a couple of weeks, she has to come back to New York for treatments. They stole some doctor's forms in the beginning to make it look official. This can't get back to Burnell. I've seen what he can do. What? Trust me. (PHONERINGING) Hello? Ed, it's me, Julie. Are you all right? Where are you? I've been so worried. I didn't know if I'd ever find you. I got your letter this morning. It was forwarded. Why did you run from me on the street? Uncle Burnell didn't realize who you were. He thought you were trying to hurt me. It all happened so fast. Ed, are you all right? I'm fine. Didn't know where you were. Did you go to the police? They didn't believe me. Thought I was crazy. I'm just so happy I found you. I'm much better now, Ed. I just wanna go home. Please take me home. - I'll come get you. - No, I'll meet you. I'm still at Uncle Burnell's. It's all the way out in Brooklyn. I'll meet you at the arcade across from the bus station. Tell Uncle Burnell to bring you. If he's been taking care of you, paying for your food and medicine... You're my wife. That's my duty. Uncle Burnell doesn't mind, although it has been kind of expensive. You bring him along. I want to shake his hand. - I wanna pay him back. - Okay, sweetheart. Lynne Sutter's looking for you. She says the story's ready to go tomorrow, and she wants to know what to do with it. - Hope you told her. - I told her you'd call her. Mary Beth, you got some company waiting. Hello. - Hi, Burt. - Hi, Burt. Listen, remember what we were talking about? I'm sorry, Burt. I cannot arrest you. I told you before. Wait a second. We can work something out. I've got some information on that case you're working on. What is it? Julie Carson got a message today. I was real surprised when she called in to pick it up. She never has before. Who was it from? Well, can we work something out? Just give me the message. I'm not kidding around. Neither am I. Look, you know how I feel about my career. Now, the way I look at it, you've got two choices. You can either lock me up for withholding evidence... All right. - Okay. - We have a deal, then? Okay. She was supposed to call Ed Waits at this number. - Petrie, arrest this man. - Thank you. In or out anytime today? - Thank you. - Come on. The desk man gave Ed directions to the arcade near the bus station 40 minutes ago. Ed! I missed you so much! I was afraid we'd never find each other. I should've known that couldn't happen, not to us. Ed, this is Uncle Burnell. You remember. Hello, Ed. I'm sorry about the other night. You understand I was concerned about our little girl. - CAGNEY: Ed! - I didn't realize that... Ed! - I'll get the girl. - Hold it. - Julie? - Hold it. - Julie! - Wait. Mr. Waits, put it down. Come on, hold it! - Stay away from me. - Put it down, huh? (EXCLAIMS) Ow! Let me take over. Give it to me. - Chris, he's got a gun! - Let go of her. Let go. (SCREAMING) Easy, Ed. Settle down. Just settle down now. You don't have to run. You don't have to be afraid. I know he's been making you do these things, but he's not gonna hurt you anymore. Stay away. - Leave her alone. - Just put down the gun. No. I know what you think. You said she was bad. Ed, I'm putting my gun away. I'm unarmed. We're gonna walk towards you. It's all right, sweetheart. They won't hurt you. Nobody's gonna hurt you anymore. You'll be safe. - Don't do this. - I don't care. He hurt her. I won't let her be hurt anymore. She'll be safe. That's all I want. - Tell him the truth. - Let her go. You're the only one he'll listen to. Tell him. For God's sakes, Donna, tell him the truth. I'm not your wife. I never was. Burnell's my husband. We lied to you. No. Yes. Let him go. Why? You loved me. No. I loved you. Mr. Waits, give me the gun. Get over there! Get over there! You wanna grab some dinner? I just thought maybe you might not wanna go right home. I really blew it with Frank. Chris, if he means something to you, how come you had to pick him to prove a point? I didn't pick him on purpose. Just bad timing. You picked the timing, lady. Yeah. - Mary Beth? - Yeah. You ever think you were burned out and wonder if you were losing it? What do you mean? I don't know. Just that... Like something inside you isn't ticking anymore. Like you really just couldn't care for anybody. - Christine. - What? You care.
