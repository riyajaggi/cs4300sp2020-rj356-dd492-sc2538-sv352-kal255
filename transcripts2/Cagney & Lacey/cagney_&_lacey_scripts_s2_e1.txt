 NARRA TOR: Next on Cagney & Lacey. - Police! - Drop it! I can't sign this. This is not what I saw. What the hell are we talking about here? What we're talking about here is that our butts are on the line every time we go out that door! - You and Cagney have a problem? - No, sir. Of course not. She's working, I'm working. But you ain't working together. I was looking for Chris Cagney.

 She's not here, Willie. Can I take a message? WILLIE: She said she might go down to the docks, but I wanted to tell her that the undercover guy isn't on duty today. Willie, where are you now? Right there. Don't move! (HORNS HONKING) (SIREN WAILING) We're being invaded. LACEY: Murray Hill's a little off her beat, don't you think? So we'll give her a slight reorientation. Hello. Sorry, no sisters. We got a comedian. You want to try pushing it back down to the 20s?

 Hey, what's it to you, blondie? Here's what's it to us. You wanna move it or what? I'm supposed to be impressed? Any creep off the streets can buy a shield for $1.59. Do you believe this? Perhaps we should make our position more clear. Be cool. I'm just gonna reach into my bag and get my ID. Okay? Okay? Here we go. Mara Frost, Anti Crime Unit. Just having a little fun, guys. - Terrific. Terrific. - There you go. Now it's our turn. All right. - What are you doing? You can't... - I tell ya, gotta be careful, right? Any creep can buy a shield, right? Come on, guys. Murray Hill's waiting for your protection out there. - Here we go. - All right. Clarence and Bacilli, you got 38 between First and Lex. - Strummer, Ritollo? - Yo! Same blocks as Wednesday. Hey, Ritollo, keep an eye on my shop. I've got a new supply of cameras today. - Terrific. I can get a good price for them. - Oh, that's very funny. - You're not gonna hear the end of it. - I'll sleep there. I'll tell your wife when I... (BOTH ARGUING) Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. We're wasting a lot of time here. Control your partner, Hauser. His concern for this neighborhood's giving me stomach cramps. Well, why don't you take some magnesia? - Say, Bob, what about those permits, eh? - We're not cops, Jack. Well, we might as well be. We're doing the same job. I've been waiting for these permits for a month. You know, I'm tired of the bad guys having all the firepower. M-16s we don't have. Use this instead. Oliver, you and Hauser are from here to 34th. Okay, guys, let's do it. And let's stay awake out there. And let them remember that the Murray Hill Street Team is on the job. Gentemic. All you have. I don't know what that is. I'll have to look it up, okay? - Hurry. Now. - I'm hurrying. Gentemic? It's never been approved in this country. You can't get it here. Something else, then. (CHATTERING) Yeah, but you schlep in from Great Neck every day. Come on, Jack. I love Murray Hill. So do I, but you gotta admit that it's getting crazy. - Yeah, but we're winning. We're winning. - We're winning. Just stay close to the curb. Who knows who's hiding in the doorways? - What's the matter? What're you doing? - Look. (GUN FIRES) Call it in, huh? I got this guy. You go that way. This is Oliver. Hyken's Pharmacy. So far it's been a pretty dead night except for you guys. DISPA TCHER ON RADIO: Abort that, Car 19. Tell me about it. Any difference in the class of proposition up here? - Those rich guys all want you to like them. - Any units, Lex and 35, possible shots fired. We got a 10-30 two blocks away. (SIREN WAILING) MAN ON WALKIE-TALKIE: Maintain visual contact. What do you think I'm trying to do? LACEY: I'll get around, try and cut him off. CAGNEY: All right. - Chris, down the alley. - All right, go! I'm right behind you. (PANTING) (GUN FIRING) We got your man. Hold it right there! - Police! - Drop it! No! Hold back that crowd. I don't want any of them here. Get on it, Higgins. - Lieutenant. - Yeah. Mead's just made a statement to Marquette. - The Inspector is on his way over. - Good. What happened to the other guy? I caught a glimpse of him before he went over the fence. Then Officer Mead followed him and he got away. There were just two perps. I mean, we shouted. Neither of them stopped. The other MUST guy, Oliver, he was the first one to the victim. Nobody knew that Hauser was a member of the Sidewalk Team until then. My God, we shot a civilian. Take it easy. We're gonna live through this. Get that light the hell out of my eyes! Get it out! - Who found the gun? - I did, sir. Crime Scene marked it a little over two feet from the wounded body. We sent it over to Ballistics. All right. Let's get away from all this. I'll have a clerk type up your statements. Then you'll sign the 6A, Witness to an Incident forms, right? They understand that. - How many shots were fired? - Two, sir. Possibly three. I heard two bangs. But the MUST guy never had a chance to fire, so it must've been echoes. Well, that could've been. There's all these walls. - Were you with Mead? - Yes, sir. When did you see the gun in the victim's hand? I saw the first guy up on the fence. The victim, Hauser, had fallen down, and as he got up he came around like this. And that's when Mead and I saw the gun in his hand. That jive? Well, sir, I was back there when Hauser fell. It's... I don't really know. That's a different angle. - Did you see Cagney and Mead approach? - No, sir. But I distinctly heard them identify themselves as police officers. Then the shots came after they identified themselves as the police? Yes, sir. They were yelling, and Hauser and the perp kept moving, so I yelled, too, and then the shot. Well, what do you say? We got everything we're gonna get here. Let's wrap this up back at the Precinct. Come on. I'll give you guys a lift. Bert, let them ride in together. Talk it over. I'm sure you'll find that you both saw exactly the same thing. Bert. Samuels says the reports won't be typed up until tomorrow. We're free. Well, Mary Beth, did we see the same thing? We saw what we saw. He had a gun. Did you see the shadows in those alleys? Like ink, they were so black. Mead saw the gun, that's why he fired. What are you saying to me, Chris? I'm saying you were there. Come on, you had a view. It was dark. Yeah, it was dark. But he had a gun, I saw it. Well, so what's the big deal? If you saw it, it must've been there. Loosen up, will you? Let's go home. COLEMAN: Captain says you get to sleep in tomorrow. When you get here we'll put you on clerical. Let him cool off. You guys did first-rate work here tonight. No trouble here. Trust me. - How you doing, kid? - I'm hanging in. - Yeah? - Yeah. Thought I could catch you. I just got word from the hospital. Hauser died. Oh, jeez, I had the light off so I wouldn't wake you up. - No, you didn't wake me. - Careful there. That's wet. Oh, right. I just thought I'd grab a little milk, that's all. Thank you. - The shooting thing's got you, huh? - Yeah, it got me. Gotta be tough with that guy what's-his-name dying. Hauser. Back away from it, babe, just back away. The man is dead, Harv. He was a civilian and he's dead. And now Jerry Mead's whole life is on the line. He's a young guy. He's not yet 30. But you and Chris were there, you saw what happened, right? Mead could lose the whole thing, the job and the benefits. They could bring him up on criminal charges. So you told them what you saw, that's all you can do. What's the problem? Yeah, I told them what I saw. I saw Hauser. I did not see any gun. Oh, babe. Come on. You never read Les Miserables? Required at the academy. So, you empathized with the gentleman, didn't you? But the gentleman didn't rip off $2,000 in video equipment. It's an analogy. Look, we all got needs. - Sorry. - No vision. You read this? Jerks. How's Jerry Mead? - I don't know. - It's okay. Mary Beth and I will sign the statements, and he'll be fine. - Did you ever shoot anybody? - No. SAMUELS: Cagney. - Good morning. - Good morning. Where's Detective Lacey? She should be here any minute. I'm a little early. - You two straighten everything out? - Absolutely. We had to consider the vantage point, the angles of vision, all of that. It was simply a matter of reconstructing the details of the moment before we could reach a conclusion. That's how we work. I've been aware of your work for some time. - Have you? - Yes. - Morning. - You're late. Forget it. These are the 6A forms. Read them to determine if they reflect what you saw and sign them. And then what happens? They go to the Firearms Review Board, who will question Officer Mead and make a finding. And then he can go back on patrol? - Whenever he's ready. - Great. Thank you. What's the problem? I can't sign this. This is not what I saw. No? I thought that was your statement last night. I'm changing my statement, sir. I've tried to reconstruct the incident allowing for shadows and the confusion and all. When I saw Mr. Hauser, he was not holding a gun. If this form does not represent an accurate account of the event as you witnessed it, then you shouldn't sign. I know that, sir. Thank you. Detective Cagney, do you stand by your statement? Yes, I do. We'll be in contact with you both. Thank you, Lieutenant. Right, sir. Okay, so back to work. Cagney. I want you two to talk to that Dr. Oliver, see if he can tell you anything about the perp. And when you get back here I want you to check out Narcotics, find out if they know anything about the stuff that the perp was trying to steal. - Gentemic. Gentemic. You got it? - Yes, sir. - I'm sorry, Chris. - For what? - What is that? - Doughnuts. You eat them. I went out to buy one but I figured it was just as easy to buy a dozen, huh? Maybe later, huh? What can I tell you? I'm a nice guy. Hold up a minute, will you? What are you running for? Got things to do. Will you just wait? Could we talk about this before we go out? About what? - What are you so mad about? - I'm not. Don't do that to me. If you have something to say just say it. Look, I just would like to get to work. You apologized... - That wasn't an apology. - Oh, good, because there's no reason to. So what are we wasting our time for? You'll be fine. Just don't let any more puppies scratch you in the eye, okay? Okay. Bye-bye. I'll be right with you. Look, I've been through this a thousand times. CAGNEY: Just once more. He was a little taller than me, blond hair, wearing a blue pea jacket. That's all I can tell you. What about Hauser? What do you remember before it happened? He was chasing the man. I had come up a different alley but I was looking right at him when he turned, saw the officer... Next thing I knew he was down. And he never fired a gun at the officer in pursuit? I've told this to everybody. He didn't have a gun. We don't carry guns on patrol, and I don't know where that one came from unless, like they say, some cops carry guns for just that reason. What do they call it? A throwaway. No. No, sir. It was not a throwaway. I know I saw Hauser with a pistol in his hand. OLIVER: Is that the official version? Not yet. Listen, ladies. We in medicine know that under stress different people perceive events in different ways. It has to do with hormones produced by the body to cope with danger. We know all about those hormones. Thanks. All right. All I'm trying to tell you is that what you saw or remembered you saw could be the result of a physiological event. It seemed real to you, but it wasn't. We appreciate your time, Doctor. Detective Lacey? Yeah. My name is Milton Burns. I represent the widow and children of Jack Hauser. That was fast. I've been legal counsel to the Murray Hill Sidewalk Team since its inception. Detective Lacey, is there somewhere we can talk? What for? The family is planning on filing a wrongful death suit against the police department of the city of New York and Officer Mead. Your testimony will be vital to the case. This is not the right time. - Eventually you'll have to face this. - Send me a subpoena. - I got Narcotics. - How much? (CHUCKLES) - Chris? - I heard you. Yeah. On two. Gentemic. G-E-N-T-E-M-I-C. It's a morphine-derived analgesic. It's only sold in Sweden. Yeah. That's what our guy was after. What time? All right, thanks. Bye-bye. - This stuff going upstairs? - Yeah. Why don't you let me keep that one? Murray Hill Sidewalk Team. Go ahead. You want it or not? No. I'm through with it. - Thanks for trying to protect me. - I wasn't. Jerry, it's gonna be okay. Sure, no problem. After all, it could've happened to anybody. We were both standing there. We both saw the gun, you and me. Just chance that I was the one who killed him. That wasn't fair. Why not? He was right. I was ready to shoot, he just happened to fire first. Come on, Chris. Hey, Mary Beth, this could happen to anybody. Even you. Except you didn't happen to see the gun. No, I did not. You're sure this time? - Are we finally gonna do this? - What? I'm just asking you a question. What did you want me to do this morning? Sign the form anyhow? - Tell them I saw a gun I did not see? - No. What I... Why don't we just forget it, huh? Just forget it. Why don't we just finish it? You made me look like an idiot in there this morning. I'm sitting there with Marquette and I'm saying, "Hey, don't worry. "Everything's fine. No, Lacey and I have talked "and of course we saw the same thing." - Then you walk in... - Is that the problem? I made you look bad in front of an inspector? - That's part of it. - So give me all of it! I didn't go after this job because I couldn't find anything else, all right? I did not come here because I needed some kind of work to help pay the orthodontist. This means something to me. What the hell are we talking about here? What we're talking about here is that our butts are on the line every time we go out that door! Now, that gun was there, and you didn't see it. If you missed it this time you're gonna miss it next time, too. - SAMUELS: What's going on here? - Nothing. Hold it. They just sent over the ballistics on that shooting. So? So the bullet that they took out of the pharmacist's wrist matched the pistol you guys found by Hauser's body. It means the perp dropped it getting away. Hauser never had a gun. - You're wrong. - Sorry. The man was unarmed. - Looks like a bad shoot. - I saw that gun. (DOOR SLAMS SHUT) Lacey. See you tomorrow. (INTERCOM BUZZES) Yes, sir. - Like to come in here a minute, please? - Sure. - You and Cagney have a problem? - No, sir. Of course not. She's working, I'm working. But you ain't working together. Well, we don't always work together, sir. We do handle different cases, you know. Go ahead. Ventilate. What, you want me to open a window? What? Ventilate. Let it all out. Let me be a sounding board. Oh, I don't think so, Lieutenant. Don't worry. It's part of my job. Well, sir, what's going on between Chris and me is really just a matter of a difference of opinion. It's really nothing that needs to be discussed with you. Really. Good. Yeah. Feel better? Sure. Let me know when you wanna talk to me again. I'll have the press here, I'll have TV, I'll have every damn politician in this city asking why the police department is covering this up. MAN: Yeah, we know why. (CROWD CLAMORING) What's going on? Did they arrest the mayor? - What for? - We want a response from you people. We don't want a whitewash. An unarmed man was killed out there. Lookit, you can air your grievances tomorrow, but the captain is not gonna listen to a mob. You bet he's gonna listen. We got an eyewitness right here. Yeah, this is what we've got, an eyewitness. You don't understand. You're not talking to nobody tonight! - Get them out of here. Get them out. - Oh, we're gonna see about that. COLEMAN: Get them out. Everyone downstairs. They're not talking to nobody tonight. Come on, get them out of here. Why don't you two leave through the garage? Go ahead. It's just a question of breaking the ice, that's all. - If you're pros, you work together. - Yeah, they'll work it out. I had a partner on patrol once, we had a disagreement on procedure. - We settled in a very professional manner. - Yeah? How? Well, like everyone else, we put on the gloves and we stepped into the ring, and I cleaned his clock for him. LACEY: You don't know where, though, huh? I mean the dock number, whatever they call it? The berth, yeah. No. It's terrific, Willie. Thanks a lot. Hey, Petrie, you seen Chris? She called in early. Said she wanted to check out that pharmacy again. Oh. Look at this. - You got a break? - Yeah, this stuff, Gentemic, Narcotics knows all about it. They call it GT on the street. I never heard of it. That's because it comes from Sweden, only available there. (PHONE RINGS) - Detective Lacey. - CAGNEY: Just checking in. Oh, hey, we got a big break from Willie Cahn in Narcotics. Two ODs reported from Gentemic the last 10 days. Gentemic? What, the stuff the perp was asking for? Yeah, they found the DOAs down at the West Side docks. Pretty good, huh? So the perp could be someone who works on the docks. That's a foreign drug. Check the ship registry. Find out if he's a crewman. Listen, easy. We're out of this. What do you mean, we're out of this? Well, we'll have to turn it over to Narcotics, I hope they take it. Oh, yeah, right. Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll talk to you later. - How're you doing? - We'll be okay. Hope so. It's been kind of chilly around here recently. Well, as soon as we slide this over to Narcotics, then it'll be out of our hands. They snort it, shoot it, pop it, whatever. Is it as strong as heroin? Yeah. It's a barbiturate. You sure you don't want some? Mostly the kids get off on the pills. GTs, they call them. Little pink capsules. I thought it wasn't available in this country. Neither is heroin. - Comes from somewhere. - Europe? We think. Willie, do you have anybody working on this? We got undercover guys down at the docks all the time. That's how come we know about the kids who OD'd. Who were they? Junkies who hang out at the bars down there. Probably didn't know what they were dealing with. This is out of your jurisdiction, isn't it? Did you hear about Officer Mead? The one involved in that unusual shoot? Over on Murray Hill, yeah. Friend of yours. He's gonna get crucified. What I want is the perp, the original hold-up guy. He's the one who was looking for the Gentemic. Tell you what. Check out the Queen Mary Bar. We got a bartender down there, Officer Leon Wilson, black guy. He should be on today, contact him. Thanks a million. (SNORING) (PHONE RINGS) - Hello. - Hi, babe. - Did I wake you up? - HARVEY: I was just resting my eyes. - You had an early day, huh? - I'm glad you called. Kids will be home soon. What's up? - I just wanted to hear a friendly voice. - Yeah? What do you want that friendly voice to say? I don't know. Anything. "I love you. You're terrific. "The department's lucky to have you." Any of the above. Chris still giving you a tough time, huh? She pretends she never said anything, I pretend I never heard it. It'll blow over. (DOOR RATTLING) Wait a second, hon. I think that's Michael. Hang on. That... No, no. You go ahead. Give him a big hug for me, huh? Hey, I love you. You're terrific. The department's lucky to have you. (PHONE RINGS) Detective Lacey, 14th Squad. Hi, babe. Willie here. I was looking for Chris Cagney. She's not here, Willie. Can I take a message? I thought she might check back first. She said she might go down to the docks, but I wanted to tell her that the undercover guy, Leon Wilson, isn't on duty today. Hang on a minute. Let me check her at home. (PHONE RINGS) CAGNEY ON ANSWERING MA CHINE: Hello. I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'll leave a message... Willie, where are you now? Yeah, yeah, you got the right idea. Now, listen, you meet me down at Greenwich Street, and we'll talk about this whole thing. I don't want to be talking around here like that. You understand me? Sure you do. Yeah. It's a easy deal, you know. It's no big deal. It's a come-and-go kind of thing, you know what I mean? (DEALER EXHALES) All right. The right man for the job, I'll tell you that. Tough to get a drink around here, huh? He'll be back in a minute. Good. That's good. Hey, you're not from around here, right? No, not usually. How about a little... Hey. Huh? - Come on. - No, it's not my thing. Thanks. Well, what is your thing? Whatever, ludes, gorilla biscuits, GT. White wine. (LAUGHS) You holding? Yeah, well, we get some of that stuff down here. Why? You interested? I gotta score for my old man, it's just... If we could get together on the price... Baby, we can get together on anything. Normally I wouldn't be so concerned. I mean, I'm sure Chris could take care of herself. But it's just after what happened to Leon. What? Some guy fractured his jaw last night, that's how come he's off. How'd that happen? PCP, probably. Some crazy. They're all dusted down there. Well, come on. Let's go. I'm dying for a drink, I gotta tell you. That's not the regular guy, is it? Hey, how the hell do I know? Come on. You want those GTs or what? Come on. Okay. Yeah. Come on. Let's go. Yeah, this dude down there works on a luxury boat. - Yeah. - That's not a bad way to go. - You buy from him? - Hey, listen, lady. My stuff is pure, huh? That's all you gotta worry about, okay? Okay. Yeah, okay. - Not where I scored or nothing. - All right. Come on. Hi. - Wanna talk? - What about? I know you're cops. I made you the minute you walked in. - Just like I made your friend, the blonde. - Where is she? I don't know but I could guess. Guess. Look, I got a friend on Rikers Island right now for soliciting. Now, if you could get him out, I could tell you something. - What's his name? - You swear? We will talk to the D.A. Now, where is she? - Hey! - Hey. Hey, look, guys, I don't want any trouble. Yeah. I don't want any trouble either. Just give me the bread. - You got to be kidding. - Come on. Give me the bread. - My old man's really gonna be... - Yeah. (MUTTERING) - What is the problem? - No problem. LACEY: Hey! Hold it right there! WILLIE: Police! LACEY: Freeze! WILLIE: Police! - What the hell is this? - Wait! Okay, spread them. Nice. (PANTING) - Hi. - Oh, no. - Move it. - They know who's bringing in the stuff. Wonderful. And you nearly got yourself wasted finding out. - I was in control. - Like hell. - What are you so mad about? - Who's mad? Don't say thank you. Thank you. (SHIP'S HORN BLOWING) Not bad. Not bad at all. - Nope. - Sorry. No visitors. NYPD, Detective Cagney. This is Detective Lacey. We're looking for one of your crewmen. Most of the crew have shore leave. Ship doesn't sail for three days. We only have a skeleton crew aboard. - That figures. - We're looking for a man named Gunnar. It's a common name. You sure you have the right ship? We're sure enough to come back with a search warrant. It'd just be a whole lot easier to see your crew list, you know... This way. This is the entire crew list. - Here. Oscar Gunnar. - When does he get back from leave? He's here now. Works in the engine room. Where's the engine room? I'll take you there. Where's Gunnar? He's working on the catwalk, under there. Thank you. We'll find him. There he is. That's our guy. Gunnar! We're the police! We're police! Gunnar! We're gonna get you, man! Watch your step here. No place to go, Gunnar. - Police! - CAGNEY: Hold it right there! Sorry. Right there. Don't move! You don't wanna jump, Gunnar. The river's filthy. You'll get hepatitis, at least. Besides that, it's a long drop! All right. All right. Get over here. Get over here! - You speak English? - Not very good. That's good enough. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up this right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford the attorney the court will appoint you one. And this is the gun you shot the druggist with? It was an accident. Yeah, but is this the gun? It is the gun. Yes. Why did you throw it down? When he shot at me, I had to climb the fence. - When who shot at you? - The man with the armband. Could I have a cigarette? - The man with the armband shot at you? - Yes. The man with the armband had a gun? Please, could I have a cigarette? You were right. - Thanks. - Okay. When I saw Jack Hauser, he was not holding a gun. Maybe he already dropped it, maybe it was still in his pocket. I am a good police officer. I know you are. Don't ever talk to me like that again. And don't you ever question my motives for doing my job. Okay. So, is this over now? Not that easy, Chris. I knew it. Yeah. So, there was another gun in that alley, and it's disappeared. Not by itself, it didn't. We know Hauser had a gun. - Why are you talking to me? - Because you removed it from the scene. That's not true. If it were true, you'd arrest me. We arrested the man who robbed Hyken's Pharmacy. He made a statement that Jack Hauser not only had a gun but Hauser fired at him. Right now there are six officers from Crime Scene Investigation looking for that bullet. - When they find it... - And they'll find it. ...then we'll arrest you. If someone... Let's say someone did remove the gun from the alley. He could be prosecuted, correct? It's a felony. I looked it up. He could also be charged with Possession of a Weapon in the third degree, also a felony. And all this stuff is negotiable, Doctor. Jerry Mead is a good policeman. Right now, his life is going down the sewer. I got to him first in the alley. The gun was next to him. I slipped it under my jacket. OLIVER: Would you take it out, please? If you'd have found the gun in the alley, everything we've tried to put together in the neighborhood would have been destroyed. One round fired. I have a child at home. I didn't want to keep it in the house. I don't blame you. Sir, I'm gonna need you to come down to the station to make a statement. If you people were doing your job, none of this would have ever happened. Hey, Mead, I heard about the board's decision. Congratulations. Hey, thanks a lot. - When are you going back on patrol? - I'm not sure. Are you gonna take some more time off? Yeah, I'm not sure I'm going back on patrol. You can't know what it's like. I do. - You shot someone? - LACEY: Yeah. It's a bitch, ain't it? - How are you doing? - I'm a little tired. I think I'm gonna pack it in. Can I buy you a drink? Well, they're probably waiting dinner for me. Could I just buy you a drink? You think one is gonna do it? It's a start.
