 You're wrong, Christine. We're after them for revenge. Not because they broke the law, but because they humiliated us. I don't want problems. I want arrests. A cheery "good afternoon" to you, too, sir. Well, your gun was used in another robbery. They killed a bartender with it. (TIRES SCREECHING) Somebody call the cops. You can go charging all over the city, and I'm supposed to be the one that keeps you from kicking in the wrong door. What are partners for?

 (ALARM SOUNDING) - Oh, great. - Want to make a run for it? Look at this, my friend. 115,000. Retail. Gleason said it marked down to 35, that's what tipped me off. - $35,000, eh? It's a steal. - Exactly. This is part of that New Jersey hijacking last winter. Super Fence gets his hands on it, it ends up in one of your leading department stores. Good work, Isbecki. You got those furs out of there just in time. Why? My daughter has a charge account at Gleason's. SAMUELS: A kid disappears in the middle of the day in a crowded neighborhood like that and nobody sees a thing?

 - LACEY: We got nothing, sir. - What about the relatives? He's got grandparents in Union City. How does a five-year-old get to Union City by himself? Besides that, they have been in Arizona the past week. Well, where is he? Three days is a long time. Yeah, there's no ransom note. There are no witnesses. There are no leads. No nothing. Well, go on back over it again. There's got to be something. - So who is this Super Fence, anyway? - Fellows. Excuse me, gentlemen. - I need an opinion. - Yeah. What do you think? Very pretty, Petrie, but it doesn't match your tie. It's for Claudia. An engagement ring. Marcus, what a shocking admission. An engagement ring for the mother of your child? Well, I couldn't afford one when we were first married, but now, with the promotion, I feel like I have a few extra bucks to spend. Petrie, you're only moving up one grade. It's a very expensive ring. Twenty percent down, a few years to pay. I had it engraved. You think she'll like it? Did you know that the Romans dedicated the emerald to the goddess Venus? They felt that the constancy of love would be revealed to them - and that the... - Petrie, Petrie, she'll like it. Trust me. Your going so hard after this Super Fence wouldn't have anything to do with Petrie's promotion, would it? Lots of people deserve promotions. So we just go back and ask some more questions. And what do we say to Mrs. Leighton? "Sorry, Mrs. Leighton, we don't know what we're doing, - "and we don't know where to start." - It's honest. Chris, Mary Beth, you're women. That man must be a detective. The ring. What do you honestly think? Will Claudia really like it? You asked me this this morning, Petrie. She'll love it. - Detective Lacey, 14th Squad. - Mary Beth? Yes, Mrs. Leighton? What was that? You keep him there, and we'll be right over. Yes, ma'am. - They find him? - She found a witness on her own. One of Mikey's friends saw him get into a car or something. Solid police work pays off again. She'll love it. - Mary Beth? - She'll love it. - Now, Joey, you said it was a green car? - Maybe it was blue, too. Blue, too? - Joey, you know what kind of a car it was? - It was a big car. All cars are big. - Was it new or was it, like, beat-up? - It was big. Detective Cagney? - Hey. - Anything? No, no luck. Hey, Petrie, you and Claudia going to go out and celebrate tonight? No. I wanted to, but she has night school. I'll just have to give her the ring afterwards. - Oh, that's a shame. - But that's no good. Well, maybe we ought to have a celebration of our own. - Huh, Mary Beth? - No. Yeah, really. You know, possibly one drink? What with Petrie's promotion and all. - I really don't... - Absolutely. - No, absolutely. - Absolutely. That's it. I think we need a little more spirit here in the old 14th. - Yeah. - I'm hereby announcing a new tradition. From now on, anyone who receives a commendation or a promotion - buys the rest of us a round. - Absolutely. CAGNEY: All right, are we in? Because tonight it's on Marcus. - Tonight? - Tonight, great. - You in, La Guardia? - I wouldn't miss it. - Chris, I... I... - Great, where's Isbecki? - Does he want a pint? - I doubt it. He's going after that Super Fence like there's no tomorrow. CAGNEY: Oh, how come? - A little jealousy, I'd say. - LACEY: Christine, Chris? Lieutenant. Lieutenant, come here. Come here. Petrie is throwing a party for himself tonight, would you like to come? Party? Oh, you don't want me. I'll be getting in the way. - No. - Come on, Bert. All right, okay, yeah. And I know just the place, too, over at 7th Precinct. Used to be a regular hangout when I was still in uniform. - That's great. Okay, we're on, right? - Christine? - Are we on? - Chris. - What? - I cannot go tonight. Harvey's making veal scaloppini. Oh, Mary Beth, come on. We've been working our tails off on this Leighton case, I want to play. Harv gets very testy when he makes veal... Do you know how hurt Marcus would be if you didn't come? - One beer. - Got it. Who ever thought that I would need a beat as much as I do? (LOUD ROCKMUSIC PLA YING) I'll bet the music wasn't as loud then. Cops belong in the street, not behind a desk. - Hear, hear. - I'll drink to that. Do you hear that? Kind of hard to miss. Yeah. It's an anapestic beat. It could kill you. - What? - Never should have left. Rock music is loaded with it. It reduces the body's thymic activity. Causes all your muscles to go weak. Then it leads to switching in the cerebral hemispheres. I'll risk it. No, I can't allow that. Your health is too important to me. I'm going to see if I can't get some real music on that machine. - Oh, boy. - Yeah. We got a Lombardo, I know it. Oh, gee, will you look at that? It's almost 11:00. - Are you relaxing or are you worrying? - Both. You can't do both. I was relaxing before. Now I'm worrying. I get it. - You got a phone? - It's in the ladies' room. Claudia has no idea about this ring. This is going to be the biggest surprise. - Isn't that great? That's great. - LA GUARDIA: Nothing. Nothing more than three months old on it. Oh, admit you want to dance with me, La Guardia. MAN: Nobody moves! (WOMAN SCREAMING) MAN 1: Pile of goodies... MAN 2: Sit still. ...at the center of each table, now. Don't give us any trouble if you don't want to get hurt. - Now, nobody tries any heroics... - MAN 2: Pass it around. - ...or I'll blast this old twit. - Not around people... - And no discussion. - ...there are too many people here. Harvey, it's not like I do this every day. I'm sorry, it got later than I thought. Car keys, too. In the bag. All right, now, behave, old man, and you won't get hurt. MAN 2: Come on, let's have it. MAN 3: I gave you everything. Bloody old dude's packed. Everybody freeze. He's a cop. - Mary Beth, she's... - This is not a bloody seminar, my girl. Keep it shut! Now, tell me, old man, you got any cop friends in here, have you? Right. Well, if no one confesses, I'll blow your head off. Yeah, we're police officers. - Stay down. - All right, everybody on the floor. Move it! (PEOPLE SCREAMING) - Move it. - Get down! MAN 2: On the floor, belly down. Very good. Get down there. - Get up. - Stop it. Lady cops, elderly cops. Well, New York is an equal opportunity employer, isn't it? Don't push it. Oh, don't push it? Don't push it, or what? You want to draw down on me, love, is that it? Well, it's your job, isn't it? Maybe I won't shoot. You've got a gun in your purse. It's only a few inches away. - Why don't you try me, love? - SAMUELS: Cagney, don't. (GIGGLES) Get on the floor. Oh, oh. Look at the pretty ring. Get a load of this. Cleaning up tonight. Harv, if we hadn't spent this whole time standing around arguing, I could have been home by now. I'm hanging up... I am hanging up right now. Oh, oh, Harvey, you don't mean that. Now, you better have saved me some of that veal. Uh-uh. Not tonight, sugar. Get down, get down. Now! Good girl. Well, thank you very much. It's been a pleasure doing business with you. MAN 2: Anyone who comes out that door after us is dead. (TIRES SCREECHING) (HORN HONKING) Somebody call the cops. You should have let us know you were coming over this way, Lieutenant. We could have provided you with a police escort for your security. One of them, the leader, he had an accent, - a British accent. - He was cockney. You certainly do have a unique approach to crime fighting, I'll say that for you. Total immersion. You want to just write down "cockney"? STOCKWOOD: Gee, over at our place, you see, we still do things the old-fashioned way. I mean, we go out and arrest the robbers. Really? Then what do you do? Torture them to death with your sense of humor? All right, Cagney. Anything else you need, Detective Stockwood? Well, let's see, they got your money, your ID, your shields, your handcuffs and your weapons. You guys still got your underwear? All right, you got our story, now go on out and arrest somebody. Oh, I will, don't worry. Which reminds me, my lieutenant wanted me to pass along a message. This case belongs to the 7th Precinct, so don't you guys do anything without consulting us. Yeah, sure. You just going to leave it there? Yeah, you mustn't let a schmendrick like this Stockwood get to you. Stockwood? Forget him. I want that cockney, with his big gun. I want him in a room alone for five minutes, where there are no civilians in the line of fire. So I'm asking you, are we leaving it to this comedian or what? No, no, we're not. Can I have a Scotch, please? (WOMAN CRYING) Insurance will cover the ring, Marcus. I didn't have it insured. It's very stupid. I'm going to be paying for years for a ring I don't even have. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Oh. Yeah, yeah. - LACEY: Harvey? It is after 2:00. Harvey, please, I have to take off my shoes. You said you were coming right home. I am worried out of my mind. Where the hell have you been? You promise you won't get upset? - I was robbed. - What? We were all robbed, with shotguns, in the bar. - You okay? - Yeah, sure. I thank God they didn't hurt anybody. You want to tell me about it? Well, I really didn't see much. It started going down when I was on the phone with you, - and I came out of the ladies' room... - You walked right into the middle of it? - You could have been killed. - I'm okay. And we were arguing, 'cause I felt neglected. - I am such a jerk. - Well, honey, it's not a big deal. No, it is a big deal. I'm on the phone whining that I don't care if you ever come home. What if you'd been shot? What if those were the last words I ever said to you? Harvey, come here. "What if" don't count, okay? You may have noticed, I'm an officer of the law. Things like this are going to happen. But this was different, you know it was. Yeah, well, tonight we were the victims. Lord, I'm exhausted. Mary Beth, I promise you, I am never, ever going to talk to you that way again. - Oh, come on, Harvey, people fight. - No, not us, not anymore. Well, that's the dumbest thing I ever heard in my life. Just listen to me. I'm telling you, not anymore. Do you want to fight about this here? - I love you, babe. - I love you, too. - Hey. - Hey, where you been? Nowhere, knocking on doors. Trying to find another witness that might've seen a car pick Mikey up. Any luck? Couple of people wouldn't even talk to me. They said my temporary ID did not look real. I'm doing some math here. It's going to cost us $223 each to replace everything that was stolen. - How much? - 223 bucks. Oh, Lord. That includes 18 cents for a new shield pin. They give you the shield, you understand, it's the only thing they do give you. Then they stick you 18 lousy cents for a pin. Plus, they stole my new purse. $38, on sale at Macy's. Plus $17 in cash and my lucky... Where is everybody? Petrie and La Guardia went and had their pictures taken for their new permanent IDs. That's $7.50, right there. For a lousy picture? I get four for a buck on the subway. And Samuels is in his office with Marquette. Look, I know you're going to have to bring charges against us for losing the guns and the shields. I don't have any choice. It's regulations, Bert. I'm sorry. Thanks for the concern. It's bad enough that every cop in this town is laughing at this precinct, but have you read the papers? We're the laughingstock of the entire city. Well, would you have preferred if we blew away a dozen or so innocent people? I'm not interested in a philosophical discussion. The fact is, you let those goons walk all over you, and when this town laughs at my officers, it laughs at me, and I'm not going to stand for that. Now, you see to it that your squad redeems itself, Bert, and quick. Or you'll find yourself back in uniform so fast, it'll make your head spin. Yes, sir. Hey, it's terrible. I'm really sorry I wasn't there with you guys. So are we. I know together we could have taken them. But I was on the job. This kind of thing reflects on the whole squad so, you know I want to help, whatever I can do. Thank you. Listen, as soon as I finish nailing Super Fence... Victor, go away from us now. Okay? Sure, sure. Okay, I'm gonna bottom-line it. We can expect a speedy trial from Internal Affairs. Try kangaroo court. Probable penalties, five days' loss of pay for the gun, another five days for the shield. I think that totals about $1,200, up to $1,600 depending on the grade, and that is over and above the cost of replacements. - There goes Michael's braces. - There goes my life. Now, I know you got other cases to work on, but there used to be a thing around here called free time. You can forget it. I want every spare moment dedicated to catching the scum that robbed us. - Anybody got any complaints about that? - Not from me. - Petrie? - I just want to get my hands on them. That's good. La Guardia? Yeah. - Lacey? - Yes, sir. - You can count on me, too, Lieutenant. - Good. We're putting everything aside till we clear this thing up. Well, we can't do that, Chris. We got the Leighton kid, and we got that co-op burglary thing. What, have you forgotten what that man did to us? No, but let's not get carried away, here. It's not a John Wayne movie. Mary Beth, he humiliated me. - What is this, cops or vigilantes? - It's personal. Bert. You know, I'm looking forward to getting out and pounding the pavement again. Bert, I want to resign. I know how you feel, Paul. No, you don't. He took me easy. Maybe he's right. Maybe I am too old to be a cop. Yeah, they took us all easy, but we let them. We had to, otherwise we would have endangered innocent lives. He pushed me around that bar like an old mop. - I'm quitting. - Wait, wait, wait till you cool down. My mind's made up, Bert. There's no room on the force for a worn-out old man. Hey, come on, will you stop talking like that? - You're not that much older than I am. - You can still cut it. Paul. We've known each other too long for me to lie to you, and the truth is, you're a good cop and I need you here. What happens the next time some punk draws down on me, and I let him and somebody gets killed? No, I know you too well for that. - I want to resign. - I can't hear you. Damn it, Bert, I tell you I'm quitting. And I tell you I'm not listening. Now, you get out of here, La Guardia. We both got work to do. After Ted died, I tried to spend more time with Mikey, but I work. I need the overtime. Mrs. Leighton, it's four days he's been gone now. There's no ransom note. There's nothing at any of the hospitals. No, ma'am, that's good. That's a reason for hope. Then where is he? Would he have any reason to have run away? You must have been talking to Ted's parents. No, ma'am, our information is they're in Arizona. (SIGHS) They were shopping for a house to retire to, - but they're back. - You don't get along? They never forgave me for starting to date again. Ted's been dead for over a year. I loved him. God, I loved him, but I felt so alone. Could Mikey have run away to them? He didn't run away. He loves me. (CRYING) He loves me. Anything? Nothing. A lot of guys who like to knock off bars and restaurants, but none that matches our three. - I can't concentrate. - Why not? There's a little kid missing four days. That's what we should be on. We're on our way to Union City, for God's sake, to see his grandparents. This is not our case. Whatever they did to us, - this is not... - It is. You're wrong, Christine. We're after them for revenge. Not because they broke the law, but because they humiliated us. And I don't like it. Look, we are cops. It is our job to catch criminals. - That's all we're doing here. - That's not all and you know it. Well, we are almost there. I cannot drive and look through those files at the same time. - Hey, hey, hey. - What did I miss an exit? "Kingsley, Malcolm Kingsley, a.k.a. Mill Kingston, "also known as Danny Deever. "Two arrests in this country for bar hold-ups, armed robbery." In this country? Yes, in his native land he liked to hit the pubs. He's English. - He's English. - London, born and bred. Take a look. - Beth... - Hey, take the exit here. Kingsley fits the M.O. and physical description, right down to the accent. Great. Yeah, good. No, anything you can find. Okay, we'll be back as soon as we're through here. Thanks, La Guardia. - Thank you. - They're right in here. Terrible thing, Mikey's disappearing. Terrible. Not unexpected. - How do you mean, Mrs. Leighton? - She left him alone at all hours. Going out with strange men. Well, your daughter-in-law's been widowed for over a year now. What our Ted saw in her in the first place, we could never understand. Blanche, Blanche. - She seemed nice. - Our Ted was a computer engineer. She was a waitress. Mr. Leighton, there's a possibility that Mikey was not kidnapped. He may have run away. - Well, he never did before. - That was no fit place for Mikey. She was no fit mother. (COUGHING) Who would try to raise a child in a city like that? Blanche, you mustn't upset yourself. I'm sorry, my wife isn't well. - We're planning a move to Arizona. - We can't go now. We can't... We can't go till we find our little boy. Sir, could Mikey have found his way here by himself? When our Ted was alive, they used to bring him. We saved all of his toys for Mikey. She only brought him here once in the last year. Look, Officers, we're not bad people. We tried to welcome Judy, open our hearts to her for our Ted's sake and for the boy's. John offered to help her financially, and she refused. She wanted to raise him in her own way, she said. I'm sorry, is there anything else? You won't leave town without letting us know, will you? We're not going. We're not going, John. No, I promise you, we won't go anywhere without talking to you first. Thank you. I'll be right back. Officers. My wife has emphysema. You can see how hard it is for her to breathe. Our doctors promised us no hope, unless we can find a place with better air. I love my grandson, but I... I can't sit here and watch my wife die. We're very sorry, Mr. Leighton. Please. Will you tell me the truth? Do you think you'll find him? We're doing the best we can, sir. We'll let you know if anything comes up. Thank you. Did he run away or what? I don't know. We should probably start investigating excavations, deserted buildings along the river, anything within walking distance. Could've got on the subway, Christine, then he could be anywheres. You want a carrot stick? You know what's bothering me? Those grandparents. I tell you, Mary Beth, they were kind of hinky. The grandfather got so nervous when I saw his plane tickets. Well, they're under a lot of strain. She's sick, their grandchild is missing. These are supposed to be their golden years. - Yeah. - Would you look at that? I packed the wrong sandwich, peanut butter and jelly. You know, they had a blue car. I saw it in their driveway. One of the boys has got my liverwurst, and I'm going to catch hell from somebody tonight. - Oh, boy. - I hated liver when I was a kid. It was so mushy. - I love it now, but when... - Christine, turn around. - Turn around. - What do you mean, "Turn around"? We're going back. Find a place to turn around the car. This is Detective Car 312. Would Central verify through Atlantic Airlines? - International, international. - Atlantic International Airlines. I want reservations for Mr. and Mrs. John Leighton. L-E-I-G-H-T-O-N. I want to know the date of departure and number in the party. - WOMAN ON RADIO: 10-4. - Christine, I will bet you a fancy lunch and wine, the reservation is for three. Why? Mrs. Leighton had peanut butter, peanut butter and jelly. What do you mean, she had peanut butter and jelly? When we were in the kitchen, she was putting it away. So? PB and J and a glass of milk? Does that sound to you like a snack for an elderly lady? - It could. I like it. - No, no. No, trust me here. Mother of two talking. The boy is in that house. - Name a restaurant. - We didn't bet. - We never shook on it. - Welsher! WOMAN ON RADIO:...arriving Phoenix, 12:50 p.m., Pacific Daylight Time. Reservations for two adults and one child. Thank you. Technically, we should notify the FBI. Technically? (DOORBELL RINGING) - Yes? - Mrs. Leighton, we've come for Mikey. We know he's here. Let's make this easy on everybody, okay? - Come on in. - Lieutenant? - You wanted to see us? - Yeah, I think it's terrific about finding the kid. Thank you, sir. CAGNEY: Yeah, the lead on the Torchy's robbery, I think it's a good possibility. Oh, yeah, Paul told me about that. And I've got some other news for you. - Lacey's gun has turned up. - Oh, good. Terrific, so that means I'm not gonna have to buy another one. Why aren't we all happy about this? Well, your gun was used in another robbery. They killed a bartender with it. Left it behind. It's all right. MAN ON TV: Oh, Albert. MAN 2: Yes, Doctor? - Is Martha still here? - Yes, sir, she's making coffee. Fine. May I inquire how... What you watching, babe? Nothing much. Michael's finally in bed. We can talk now. What... Hey, Harv, would you... I'm watching that. No, you're not. Come on, babe, talk to me. About the gun. Now, just take a deep breath and let it all come out. There's nothing to come out, Harv. You're the one that's making a big deal. I simply wanna watch TV here in peace, okay? No. I am not gonna let you hide out like this. I want you to talk to me and tell me what you are feeling. - You're getting me mad, here, Harv. - Good, you should be. - Don't you go telling me what to do. - I am not telling, I am voting. I got a vote here, too, and I vote we talk. Hey, aren't you the one that said we're not going to fight anymore? - So what are you doing here? - This isn't a fight, damn it. And even if it is, this is worth fighting about. - Back off, okay? - No, you listen to me, I'm just being selfish, here. 'Cause if you don't get this out now the right way, it is gonna come out sideways and that is never a lot of fun for me. And I am telling you I got nothing to talk about. I'm not responsible what they did with my gun after they took it from me. - I know. - They stole it from me. - I'm the victim here. It's not my fault. - It isn't. Thirteen years, I've been talking to victims. "Don't take matters in your own hands," I tell them. "Leave that up to the police, that's what the police are for." So, a couple of hold-up guys kill somebody with my gun. And, look at me, Harv. I want them. I want them, damn. You're a cop. You want them off the streets. No. Wrong. Not true. I want them. I want revenge. - So would I. - Well, Harvey. Then, I'm taking it personal. - Anybody would. - Like Christine. What do you do? You think you turn in your feelings - when you pick up your shield? - Yes. Yes, we have to. - Otherwise, we're in a lot of trouble here. - Good, good, rant and rave some more. You get it out tonight, and tomorrow you go in and do your job the way you want it to be done. Without vengeance. Damn them, damn them. Damn them. Damn them. (VOICES ON TV) Damn them. Should've come to us first. I got any information you want, right here at my fingertips. - Known associates of Malcolm Kingsley. - No problem, what's his Com Op number? His what? In the upper left-hand corner of the file from your precinct. There's no number. That's impossible. Well, what? Do you see a number? All files were supposed to be coded months ago. Well, we have his name, we have his whole record here. Isn't that enough? You want me to run a whole database search? I want a list of Malcolm Kingsley's known associates. Isn't that all right here at your fingertips? - Excuse us, ma'am. - What? Just take a deep breath. Well, what is the point of all this fancy equipment? - We used to be able to look in a drawer. - Mary Beth... I am fine. - Be objective. - Hey. Aren't you the one that was so hot to punch Kingsley's ticket? Well, I'm with you now. Well, I was kind of counting on you for ballast. Oh, I get it. You can go charging all over the city, and I'm supposed to be the one that keeps you from kicking in the wrong door. What are partners for? Do you two wanna continue this encounter, - say, in some... - Hey. Can you get us what we need or not? Without a Com Op number, it'll take some time. - Where are your old files? - In the basement. - Fine, that's where we're going. - You're supposed to come here. Mike Beldon still in charge here? Thank you for the information. Oh, Claudia. Hi, honey. What are you doing here? - I need to talk to you. - Oh, Claudia, this really isn't... It's important. Okay. An engagement ring? You wanna know where I've been every night? - Oh, yes, I do. - Working security for Anthony. - Your brother? - No, Mark Anthony. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That's where the $800 landed. A down payment on nothing. I so much wanted for you to have that ring. Oh, baby, why didn't you tell me? I don't want you killing yourself over some ring. I don't care anything about some engagement ring. Well, that's very good, Claudia. That's very good, because you're not getting it. - In the bar... - Yes. - They took that from me, too. - Oh, no. If I hadn't been so stupid, I wouldn't have had it with me that night. If I hadn't been so stupid, I would've had it insured immediately. Marcus, don't, please don't do this to yourself. If I hadn't been so stupid, I would've told you about it, so you wouldn't have had to come up with any crazy ideas. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. - Where are you going? - I've got to work. Here it is. Seven thirty-two. This better pan out. Beldon has been after me for a date for one year. Oh, come on, with a different toupee he wouldn't be bad. Toupee? Looked like a dead squirrel. One date, what could it hurt? Mary Beth, the man is five inches shorter than I am. Did you see his teeth? They're longer than his nose. Yeah, but he has no personality. (CHUCKLING) I'm gonna see if the guys want a piece of this. Good. (LAUGHING) (PHONE RINGS) La Guardia, 14th Squad. La Guardia, hi, it's Cagney. Listen, we got a really hot lead on those three robbers. You want a part of it? No, no, no. No, that's okay. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Is anyone else there? Is Petrie? The Lieutenant? Lieutenant went out to dinner a while ago, and Petrie was sleeping at his desk. I think he's gone home. Do you want any backup? No. We're in the 7th Precinct. I'm not gonna share this collar with those bozos. I'll talk to you later. It's you and me, kid. (ALARM SOUNDING) - Oh, great. - Want to make a run for it? No, no, no, let me finish, okay? I mean, you've had your say, I'll have mine. Well, in the period of time that you have been on this case, a man has been killed. And my detectives, working beyond the call of duty, have managed to track down a hideout of one of these robbers. And with the aid of your officers and a search warrant, they found another one of the stolen weapons. Yeah. A gun belonging to Detective La Guardia. So, as far as I can see, Lieutenant, continued cooperation, not interdepartmental rivalry, is the key to cracking this case. We're sorry to hear that you feel that way. Because we are gonna pursue these men as aggressively as we can. Somebody has to. Next. Tony "the Hype." In Joliet, 20 years, armed robbery. Cross out Tony "the Hype." Amos LaJoy. - I know Amos LaJoy. - SAMUELS: Where the hell is Petrie? I don't know, Lieutenant. He was here. Well, he's never here, and when he's here, he's asleep on his desk. Amos LaJoy ODed. What a shame. You know, you two tripped over a lot of toes last night. I've been on the phone all morning with the 7th Precinct. - Sorry, sir. - "Sorry, sir." I don't want problems. I want arrests. A cheery "good afternoon" to you, too, sir. Benny Boone. Benny Boone. Just paroled. Take bad cop, will you? Why do I always have to take bad cop? Sorry, Christine, you're very good at hostile. You sound just like my father. Everyone in my life tells me I'm hostile. Excuse me. - Hey, hey. - Heel, Spike. Out of my way, cops. Cops? Where did you get cops? Think you're undercover? You make me laugh. Hey, back off, Boone. You're not gonna be able to laugh. No, no, now, Christine, I think that Mr. Boone is very perceptive, here. Oh, I get it. You're doing good cop, bad cop. I didn't know lady cops did that one. What are you gonna tell me you like about me? - I don't like anything, pal. - Hey, hey, hey. We're not here to hassle you. What we want to find is the whereabouts of a business associate of yours. - You see this dog? - CAGNEY: Yeah. He's a killer. He's trained to eat cops. Attack, Spike. (WHINING SOFTLY) LACEY: Will you can the comedy? We wanna know about your creep friend Malcolm Kingsley. Kingsley? That limey. I'd like to catch up with him for about five minutes, that's all. Teach him to disappear with a business associate's money. Maybe you could tell us where we could find him, then. If I knew where to find him, I'd be in Florida right now. Me and Spike could hire a Lear, playing the ponies. I am beginning to lose patience, here, Boone. Hey, if I knew where to put my hands on him, I'd take care of him myself. If you happen to find him, tell him Benny Boone's looking for him. Sure, we'll warn him about Spike. Hey, you don't have to be so hostile. Get off the car. Get off the car. Persistence, that's the key. Some cops would have backed down after the first rejection. Not Victor Isbecki. That's why they call me the maverick cop, a cop that goes his own way. I make things happen. Isbecki, you won't believe this stuff, but there's a fourth truckload downstairs in the basement. Well. Now, this will probably mean a promotion. Some of us are born to be engineers, the rest just commuters. MAN: Great work, Isbecki. Nice collar. All right, thank you. Congratulations, Victor. That's good work. Better than you think, huh? - My ring, my ring! - I need to keep it for evidence. But after we're done with it in court, it's yours. Victor, I think I'm in love with you. I'm calling Claudia right now. - Where'd you get that? - The Super Fence. Oh, as for the guys who stole it, I have an address. Super Fence says it's gold. You just happened to stumble across this? While we've been breaking our rogers on it? LACEY: Lieutenant. I gotta go out with Beldon in Records. Well, listen, the thing about me is I'm a maverick. If it's meant to happen for me, it does. La Guardia, sir. You wanted to see me? Yeah, could be all three of our robbers are in there. - I resigned. - I didn't accept your resignation. Right now, you're still under my command. - You armed? - It's in the car. Yeah, well, get it. You and Cagney, you cover the far end. - Bert. - That is an order, Detective La Guardia. Petrie, you and Lacey are on me, and I want everybody to remember, these guys are killers. (MEN CHATTERING) MAN: Deal. I'm not... Just deal. Come on, on the floor. Where's your buddy? - Where's Kingsley? - Raise your hands. SAMUELS: Where is he? Where's your friend? Halt! Halt, police. Wanna draw on me, Mr. Kingsley? Maybe I won't shoot. The gun's right there. It's only inches away. Why don't you try me, love? ISBECKI: Well, I should've had a promotion. But, after all, I can understand why they only gave me a commendation. Actually, I guess it's because I'm known as a maverick cop. Victor, is this the one about the engineer and the commuters? I think we've heard this one before. Remember, I'm the one who found your ring. Of course, you can never hear the story too many times. Well, the thing is, I'm what you call a maverick cop. I'm glad we came back to Torchy's. It's the old getting-back-on-the-horse- after-you've-been-thrown syndrome. You know, you were really something out there on the street today, Paul. Bert, about that letter. You know, my office is in such a mess, I must've lost it. Thanks. So, Christine, we did good, huh? Like cops, not vigilantes. Look at us. I'm proud of us. Mary Beth. At the van, I dared Kingsley to go for his gun. That could've killed him. Hell, it could've killed me. It was stupid. You still proud of me? I'm proud you're thinking about it. I don't think I'll do that again. Hey, Chris, we got three bad guys in jail. - We found the kid. - Yeah. So, we did good. - Yeah, we did. - Yeah, we did. - We did. Guys. - Yeah. Here's to the 14th. PETRIE: Yes. SAMUELS: You said it, to the 14th. Helped the 7th. Another day, another collar. 14 forever. - Yeah. - And here's my baby. - Hey! - Hey, Harvey.
