 You're probably looking forward to my vacation as much as I am. More. Can you believe they call bookmaking a crime? I call it a social service! Would you shut up over there? Our illustrious Deputy Inspector wants two undercover nuns at St. Joseph's Hospital to break up the drug stealing operation. - Two nuns? - Sister Lacey and Sister Cagney. He thinks you're a nun, and he's making a pass at you. Listen, I don't know where I am exactly. I need to be alone for a little while. I don't push your wife any harder than I push anybody else.

 She's a police officer, a cop, and I don't pamper her just because she's a woman. I'm trying to have a nervous breakdown. Look at this. Sonia Maltese, the buckle queen. Pull over. - You sure that's her? - Don't argue with me. Pull over. I'm pulling, all right? Police. Stop! Stop, damn it! You've got the wrong person. This isn't fair. Get over there! Hey, you wanna lighten up a little? She's not exactly public enemy number one. You tell that to the people that she rips off. I want your badge number. I know important people. I'll loan you a dime. You can call them all.

 - You can't take me in. - You watch me, Sonia. A curse on you and a curse on your children. All right. - May your firstborn grow... - Go! ...ashamed of his family name! LACEY: Yeah, right away. I am so sorry to keep you on hold like that. It's kind of frantic around here. Yeah. Ma'am, can you simply discuss this with me on the phone? And then I will talk to Harvey Jr. You got trouble with Harv Jr.? Sonia's fast. We are late. LACEY: Just a moment, ma'am. I've been doing this for 20 years. Never a day in jail. Nobody arrests bookies. What kind of precinct is this? No, I'm trying to explain to you that I cannot get down to school this afternoon. My partner and I have a witness to interview. Who will not be there if we don't hurry up. First you confiscate all my cash, now you tell me you won't accept plastic. I understand it's important if my son is in trouble. Of course I want to talk with you about it. Where's my dime? I wanna call my lawyer. You won't need a dime. Manny, they got you, too. Look, I'll take care of the witness, all right. You fill out the report on Sonia. Wait a minute, Christine. Mrs. Montana, may I call you back? It's not a problem. It'd really be easier if I did it myself. Wait. Yes, yes, ma'am, I'm still here. Can you believe they call bookmaking a crime? I call it a social service! Who'd look at those games if they didn't have a little bet going? What would guys do on the weekends? Drink, beat up their wives, whack out their kids. Would you shut up over there? Great God. No, I... I am sorry. I... We all of us have policies. No, I am not asking you to bend the rules. Tomorrow afternoon is... No, I can't tomorrow. Tomorrow... Friday... I'm going on vacation Friday. I know my son is more important than a vacation. I will be there this afternoon. As soon as I can. Goodbye. Mary Beth, from Samuels. Oh, great. That's exactly what I needed. - Where is Christine? - She left. Damn it! Damn it, I told her to wait! Please, don't get mad at me. I just work here. Marcus, I'm sorry. I'm crazy. I'm crazy. I'm crazy today. I'm sorry, I... It's nothing that a week away from this place will not cure, okay? Tomorrow night, right? Yeah, it's actually 26 hours and 13 minutes, but who's counting? Sir. Hey, you. Come here. Lend me bail money. I'll give you the Knicks and spot you 10. (TV BLARING) Hey, Harvey, you wanna turn it down, please? - I'm hungry. - Where's Mom? I don't know. She probably got held up at the pizza place. There's some carrot sticks in the refrigerator. Here's your mother. Mom, I need to tell you something. Would you... Don't hang on me, Michael. - HARVEY: Where's the pizza? - Pizza? - You forgot the pizza? - Mom. Not now, Michael. Would you turn that thing off? How could you forget the pizza? Where've you been? Turn it off! I got a call today from Harv Jr.'s teacher, Mrs. Montana, - and she... - Dragon lady. You're in trouble already, young man. Now, I would tread softly if I were you. HARVEY: What's the problem? I had the great privilege of being called away from my job to be told that my son is slugging it out with his friends in the hallway. - He wasn't my friend. - Don't you point that finger at me. You did the one thing, didn't you, that you knew would get me? - HARVEY: Mary Beth. - Congratulations. You did very well. You embarrassed me in front of everybody I work with, and your teacher made me feel like an unfit mother. You wanna stop talking till you cool down? I'm sure he didn't hit somebody to make you look bad. He was trying to break into my locker, Mom. Look, you hit guys when it's a crime. This is like a felony, right? Harvey, that's the kind of question you need time to think about before you answer. We're all hungry. What do you say we go get something to eat, then we'll talk? Mike, get your jacket on. Harvey, move it, huh? Come on. I'm sorry about the pizza. Well, come on. It's not the end of the world. Wanna go for Chinese? - HARVEY JR.: Chinese stinks. - Well, then we'll get some fried chicken. I hate fried chicken. I want a hamburger. I should have got the pizza. Better, huh? It's old magic fingers here. I told you I'd get you relaxed. You wanna tell me what's got you so wound up lately? I don't know, Harv. I just... I can't even talk to my own kid anymore. And you're good with him, and I just... I've forgot the knack. I think you're doing just fine. Come on, relax. I've forgot how. Come on. Attagirl. - Oh, Michael. - What now? No, he wanted to tell me something when I came in. It can wait till morning. I yelled at him, too, honey. Oh, come on, Mary Beth, he's not gonna turn into an ax murderer just 'cause you yelled at him once or twice. Right. Right. Yeah, we're going on vacation tomorrow, babe. Yeah. And I need that vacation so bad, I can't think about anything else. When we get back from vacation, I'm gonna be a different person. I'm gonna be relaxed and loving and sexy. We have to wait till you get back? Yeah. Okay? - Okay? - Sure. No, okay? Okay, baby? Sure. Eighteen hours and 10 minutes. I'm sorry I'm late. Michael waited until this morning to tell me he needs a cake for school. - Lucky I had a cake mix, huh? - Yeah, lucky. Were you waiting long? - Ten nails and time for them to dry. - Oh, Chris, I'm sorry. Listen, I know we're in kind of a hurry here... - Kind of. - ...but we have to make a stop. Mary Beth, why? No, Chris, I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important. Harv called as I'm on my way out the door, and he said he forgot his blueprints and he cannot start unless I drop them off. Where is he? The bank building conversion in the Village. The Village? No, we'll be late for court. We can't do it. Chris, I thought about that. Now, when was Judge Carson ever on time? I don't remember. Okay, so, I figure we drop this stuff off at Harv, and we'll be in court long before the good judge. Would you trust me on this? We'll be sitting outside the courtroom with our third cup of coffee before he ever shows up. I find you to be in contempt of court, which carries with it a $50 fine each. You can see the court clerk to make arrangements. Your Honor, I'd like to say that... You were late, Detective. There's nothing more to talk about. Cops these days. Wonderful. I am four for four. I have disappointed everybody in my life. - Wait a minute. Come here. - What? - Just stay there. - What're you doing? I'm writing you a check. Mary... Forget it. I don't want your check. Chris, no. It was my fault, and I'm gonna pay for it. I just... I haven't figured out yet how to be in four places at once. Mary Beth, I do not want your money. - Now, would you stop it? - Would you make me feel better? You're making too big a deal out of this. All you need is a vacation, all right? We'll get through this one day, then you get a whole week off, and I know you can stand anything for eight hours. You're probably looking forward to my vacation as much as I am. More. - Oh, eight hours. - Come on, it's okay. I'll get it, okay? There's another check here. Eight hours. Can we do that? All right. Actually, it's six hours and 26 minutes. - But who's counting? - Who's counting? Don't cash that for a day or two, will you? SAMUELS: Cagney, Lacey. Sir, if it's about our testimony this morning, I want you to know that it was entirely my fault. Marquette's latest brainstorm. Our illustrious Deputy Inspector wants two undercover nuns at St. Joseph's Hospital to break up the drug stealing operation. - Two nuns? - Sister Lacey and Sister Cagney. I'm starting my vacation tonight. Why two? They don't travel in pairs anymore. Oh, that's good. Marquette just finished busting my chops. Now, I'm gonna get a hard time from you two. Sir, please... Can't someone else do it? Do you see anybody else in this room who could pass for a nun? Well, why does it have to be nuns, sir? Couldn't you put one of the guys undercover as a patient or something? - Because it has to be. - Sir, I need this time off. She really does, Lieutenant, and I can do this by myself. Well, there is nothing I can do. Marquette is on the board of governors at St. Joe's. He knows the place. He says two nuns, I gotta give him two nuns. This is his plan and we gotta do it his way. Put off your vacation a week or two. I'll see if I can get you an extra day. Sorry, Mary Beth. Oh, look, about the other nurses, as far as they're concerned, you and Lacey got transferred from St. Cyril's. CAGNEY: Do we wear habits or what? Yeah, whatever it is that they wear, that's what you gotta wear. This is so funny. You know, when I was a little kid, I used to wanna be a nun. Yeah. Well, now you've got your chance. Marquette says he wants this wrapped up before the first of June. You'll be working the night shift. 14th Squad, Detective La Guardia... OFFICER 1: What's our PC? If we arrest without probable cause, they'll just kick it out of court. OFFICER 2: Look, who's talking arrest? We bring the guy in for a nice, peaceful, quiet session of question and answer. Class one and two controlled substances. Morphine, Demerol, Percodan, Seconal. About $100,000 worth at street value. Who has access? The charge nurses. They're the only ones with the keys. Where the hell is Lacey? It doesn't make sense going through this thing twice. Well, get her. Mary Beth! - You guys seen Lacey? - No, I thought she was with you. - SAMUELS: Cagney! Lacey! - Coming! No, she's probably just steamed up and wants to walk it off. I'm sure she's somewhere here in the building. Yeah, I'll have her call you. Harvey, listen, I'm real sorry about your vacation. Yeah. Right. Bye. Is she coming? She wasn't home. He hasn't heard from her. She's gonna hear from me when she walks back through that door. All right, I can't wait for her to quit pouting and show her face. I need somebody else to go with you. You don't think anything's happened to her, do you? No. Come on, she's a grown woman. She's a cop. She's just miffed that her vacation got moved back. Yeah, right. Isbecki, I want you to go with Cagney over to St. Joseph's. - Isbecki? - You want me to be a nun? Oh, don't even think that. That's an... That's sacrilege. All right. Well, so what's his cover? How about a doctor? I make a pretty good doctor. Dr. Isbecki. - Orderly. - An orderly. All right, everybody, I want you to report back here tonight before you go home. I want to know everything you've got. - Right. - Orderly? Hey, La Guardia, if Mary Beth calls, can you have her call Harvey? - You got it. - Cagney! - Nail polish. - Oh, yeah. Too much, do you think? Come on, Isbecki. Orderly. WOMAN ON PA: Sister Mary Felipe, to the nursery, please. Hey, are you new? Yeah. Well, they pay better here than at Lang. They do? Hey, where do they get their orderlies, a chain gang? He going to X-ray? I'll take him. - Okay. Thanks. - No problem. WOMAN ON PA: Dr. Nelman, fourth floor, stat. That's five milligrams morphine, right? There you are. (WOMAN CHA TTERING ON PA) - Sister. - Yes. I'm sorry, Sister. I didn't realize you needed help. What can I do for you? I think you left this on the counter. Oh, well, it wouldn't do for me to lose that now, would it? Especially with all the drugs that have been stolen. Oh, good heavens. Oh, no. That isn't the key to the drug cabinet. No, no. These are the keys to the controlled substances. That's the key to my motor scooter. Thank you, Sister. (RINGING) - Hello. - Harvey, it's Chris. Hiya, Chris. I was hoping it was Mary Beth. - Haven't you heard from her? - No, no, not a thing. Not yet. Where is she? Well, you know Mary Beth, she likes to go to movies to sort things out. Maybe she found herself a good double feature, huh? - Yeah, ma ybe so. How're the boys? - They're asleep. I didn't see any reason to say anything to them yet. I just said their mother was working late. I've been living by the phone. Harvey... (MAN SCREAMING) Listen, Harvey, I've gotta go. I'll talk to you later. Everything'll be okay. WALLY: No! Pay up, baby. You're a hard man, Wally, but I never welsh on a bet. - That's $25, $35, $47.50. - Dr. Dan, the gambling man. Thank you. - Oh, a new one. Very pretty. - DAN: Can I help you, Sister? I just heard screaming, and I wondered what had happened. Mild cardiac arrest, mine. Brought on by the Boston Celtics scoring 14 unanswered points. You better get some rest, Wally, and don't spend all your winnings in one place, hear? Any time you want to bet on those bums again... - Give it a rest, Wally. - ...just come here and let me take your money. He's a sweet old guy. It cheers him up to bet on the games. Of course. It's very kind of you to take the time. Oh, just part of the whole total healing concept. Actually it's just a cheap trick to improve my recovery percentage. I haven't seen you around here, have I? Oh, I'm Sister Lorette. They transferred me from St. Cyril's. (PAGER BEEPING) I gotta get back to Emergency. You know, Wally was right. You are pretty. - I beg your pardon. - I'll see you around, Sister. Hey, I've called everyone I could think of. Where the hell is she? - You mean, she's not back yet? - What're you doing to find her? I thought she would be back by now. Come on. I'll put a man on it for you. One man, huh? Don't you think you owe her more than that? Just let me take care of this, will you? This is what we do. - You wanna have a drink? - I want my wife. Fourteen years of marriage, she's never gone off like this. What did you do to her? - Me? - Yeah, you. You wouldn't let up on her, huh? You pushed and you pushed her. You couldn't let her have her lousy seven days out of this place. Hey, look, Lacey, I don't push your wife any harder than I push anybody else. She's a police officer, a cop, and I don't pamper her just because she's a woman. No, no, she's got a family. She's got a life outside of this lousy squad room. - Well, I understand that. - No, you don't. Because you were such a good cop, you let your marriage go right into the toilet. That's a cheap shot. You know, I'm not gonna let you do that to me and Mary Beth. Me, huh? Now, look here. You wanna know where I think your wife is? I think she went off just to get away from you, that's what I think. 'Cause every time I step out into that squad room, she's on the phone talking to you about the damn laundry or the garbage or the groceries or the kids and the school, that's what. - Me? - Yeah, you. I'm the one who cooks meals so she can do overtime. I'm the one who sits home with the kids when she's working. Do you know what you sound like? You sound just like my ex-wife. See, you don't understand the first thing about being a cop. (PHONE BUZZING) Yeah. Yeah, what? It's Cagney. Yeah. What? When? Well, what the hell were you two doing? Well, all right. All right. All right. All right. All right. But I want the both of you to check in here tomorrow morning before you start. Yeah. Good night. A batch of drugs disappeared from that hospital tonight. And that's the case that your wife is supposed to be working on. Sorry for busting in here. I... I just feel so damn helpless. I wanted somebody to tell me everything was gonna be okay. All right, Lacey, I'll get somebody looking. You sure you don't want that drink? Maybe next time. (DIALING PHONE) SAMUELS: Johnny, yeah, where's Stevens? Well, tell him to get his butt in here. I've got a job for him, right now. (PHONE RINGING) Hello. LA CEY: Harv, I want you to know I'm all right. Mary Beth. No, no. Don't say anything, Harv. Please. If you say one word, I'm gonna have to hang up, okay? I... I'm sorry I worried you. That's not fair. Listen, I don't know where I am exactly. I was coming home. I was. And then I couldn't get off the train. I'm okay, but I... I need to be alone for a little while, okay, Harv? I need to stay away. And so, be a friend. Don't worry about me. All right, huh? I love you, Mary Beth. What? Damn you, Harvey, I told you... What'd you have to say that for? Really comforting, huh? You know, I used to think that it was the size of the ocean that put everything in perspective. I mean, you can't come face to face with the Atlantic Ocean and still think you're the center of the universe, right? I'm sorry. I... Look, I don't mean to be rude, but I would like to be alone. No, I know what you mean. I come to the beach for that, too, but it's more than being alone. It's the negative ionization. It puts you inward, into yourself. Very calming. No, but believe me, I have been to beaches all over the world. Barbados, CancÃºn, Marseilles, they are all different. I'm sure they are. But they all leave you with same feeling. Inner calm, negative ionization. - Listen, Miss... - No, call me Maggie. Maggie. Maggie, I don't know anything about those beaches, 'cause I've never been all over the world. As a matter of fact, this is the only beach that I know. And I would like very much to sit here on this beach, just quietly, and sort a few things out for myself, if that's all right with you. Please don't let me bother you. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLA YING) Well, I should have been here when he called. What'd he say? - Does he know where she is? - Cagney. She told Harvey she was fine, she wanted to be alone, and she hung up. You've gotta take me off St. Joe's, 'cause I'm gonna go find her. - Cagney. - What? I am as worried about her as you are. If I weren't, there'd be charges and specifications against her for being AWOL. Now, look, I've got people looking for her. You are on a case. I want you working on it. HARVEY ON ANSWERING MA CHINE: Hello, Mary Beth, please don't hang up. I ha d to go to work, sweetheart, so I wouldn't go crazy worrying about you. The Di Vestinos, they loaned me this machine so you'll know where I am. Please call me, 555-6351. Please. I love you. (ANSWERING MA CHINE BEEPING) Looks like you're a little late to make a withdrawal. Hello, Christine. Yeah, how about this place, huh? Owners think they could do better with a restaurant than a bank. - I guess they figure people gotta eat. - Yeah. Listen, Harvey, if it's my fault I'm very sorry. She's my partner, and I really push her a little hard sometimes. I just get very ambitious, you know, and I don't... I don't care that there are other people tugging at her. And I just expect her to be there for me whenever I need her. No, you didn't drive her away, Chris, any more than I did. Well, I gotta do something to try and find her. Do you know anybody that she'd go see or would want to talk to, like friends or relatives? I called everyone I can think of. Well, give me your credit card numbers. - I'll call them in... - Sure. ...and see if they've been used and where. When this place becomes a restaurant we'll have dinner here, the three of us, huh? - On me. - Sounds good. Thanks, Harvey. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLA YING ON TAPE DECK) You look so peaceful sitting here by yourself. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of making a quick sketch of you. Some people like a souvenir of their stay at the beach. How dare you? How dare you watch me like that? I want to be alone here! I'm trying to have a nervous breakdown, for God's sake, and you're sneaking around putting me on paper! Yeah, no, it's not that good, but... Don't talk to me! Out of my way. That's the same as stealing. That's the same as stealing my time and stealing myself. Please leave me alone. All right. That could be our guy. Thank you. Isbecki. Bert, just got a call from our contact at the FBI. The computer kicked back one name so far. - Yeah? - Dortmunder, Lionel A., age 28. He's an orderly at St. Joe's. His personnel card says high school education. But the Feds have him down same name, same middle initial, same age with a PhD in nuclear physics and a government clearance as a research scientist. What the hell is he doing at St. Joe's? - Find out. Take Petrie with you. - Yeah. - Let me know if something else comes up. - You got it. (WOMAN CHA TTERING ON PA) - Hi. - Hi. - Your name Dortmunder? - Yeah. You know, I thought you looked familiar when we met yesterday, but I wasn't quite sure 'cause I couldn't place you. Then it finally came to me. A buddy of mine, Eddie Dortmunder, went to Syracuse. - You related? - Nah. Not me, pal, it's the wrong Dortmunder. That's funny because you look just like him. - Police! Come on, out! - Out! Up against the car! All right, spread them. Come on. All right. Give me that one. All right. I thought you guys were working for my wife. She's driving me nuts. You know, I couldn't take the pressure. Right? Just to support this fancy lifestyle I hated. You know, if she wants to live like that, then let her get a job. I'm just happy pushing patients into X-ray and sleeping well at night, that's all. Why'd you lie on your application? (SCOFFS) Do you think they'd give me this job if they knew I had a PhD? Coffee, please. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you, but I don't really know anybody else here. Lady, you don't really know me. I wonder if I can ask you a favor. It's very embarrassing. I'm short. I need 17 cents to pay my bill. I mean, I just assumed they'd take Carte Blanche. Plus tip. What do you need? Fifty-five cents. Well, here. That's what I... Take it. - Did you study for that, for drawing? - Well, I went to Sarah Lawrence. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Actually, I majored in rabble-rousing instead of studying, but I had one semester to go and I found out that I was gonna graduate third in my class. Third! - Third is good. - Not good enough. Either I graduate first in my class, number one, or not at all, so I dropped out. So soon to graduating, why would you do that? Well, maybe to give my father another chance to define me as a failure. See, with him, either you're the best in the world or nothing. No in-between, so I could be nothing real good. Those were good times though, the '60s. All that energy. You know, somehow we all felt connected, you know, working together towards something, even if it was just scuffling with the police. Were you into that? Let's say I was there. What, trying to change the world, huh? In my way, yeah. Yeah, I wanted to make a difference. (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLA YING ON TAPE DECK) We're taking over this beach! This is the people's beach! All right, young woman, come off of that hill! I got you surrounded! Hell, no! We won't go. Hell, no! We won't go. You come along peaceably now, or I'm gonna call in the police porpoises. Police porpoises. Or the men in the white coats. What're we doing? What're we doing here? Oh, God, we were naive. Yeah. I miss it, though. I miss having people come in at all hours of the day and night, sitting up late, planning how you're gonna change the world, knowing there's always someone there to talk to. I miss that. - Do you miss it? - No. I don't miss that at all. See, I've always got lots of people around me. And they all of them want something from me here and now. I shouldn't be here talking to you. I got at least two other places I'm supposed to be. Do you know, the only time I have for myself is in between places. Ten minutes here, five minutes there, on the train. What is that on the tape? Haydn's 73rd in D. You like it? Haydn's 73rd in D. That's what I'm talking about. When was the last time I noticed music? I mean, there's things I want to know about that I don't know about. Art history or economics! I've been thinking about learning economics for years, and the closest I came was saving up green stamps, you remember them? For a calculator. There's stuff I don't wanna miss, and I'm afraid I'm gonna because I already promised too much of myself to too many people. So, one promise. One promise, what is that? - Walk away. - Oh. Look. Look at this. Look at that. Isn't that beautiful? It just floats away and disappears. You could do that. I'm expecting some money from my father tomorrow. It's a birthday guilt present. I'm gonna take off for Papeete. You wanna come? Just think about it. I am going to go ply my wares. You may not believe it, but there really are people who'd like a souvenir portrait. I'm sure there are. It may be too late to change the world, but it's never too late to see it. Think about it. I couldn't get anything on any of the charge nurses. Who has the key to the drug cabinet when they're on a break? I checked on all the assistants, too. Nothing. Maybe one of the doctors is palming the stuff. Or maybe there's a duplicate key. Anyway, they leave that drug cabinet unattended an awful lot. Cagney? Cagney, are you listening to me? - I'm sorry. - She'll be okay. She knows how to take care of herself. - Sister Lorette, I was looking for you. - Hello, Doctor. Sister, if you're free around 9:00, I'd like to buy you dinner in the cafeteria. Cleaned up on the Islanders last night. Must've cleared four or five bucks. Not tonight, Doctor, but thank you. - How about tomorrow? - Maybe. We'll see. Great. By the way, if the Rangers lose it's Dutch treat. I don't believe it. That guy's making a pass at you. Don't be ridiculous. He thinks you're a nun, and he's making a pass at you. Would you knock it off, Isbecki? He's just being nice. Isn't what you call it when I do it. You see how serene you both look. - That's negative ionization. - That's what? - Hey! - I don't think so. Thank you. Hey, Maggie! - I'm taking over this beach. - It was yours to begin with. How about a hotdog on you? Listen, Maggie, do you remember that time we were talking about when, you know, when we were so young? I did. I wanted to change the world, and I still do. So, I got married, and I had babies, and I started a job I thought was important. And that's how I thought I would change things, you know? Yeah, I know. No, I don't think you do. See, those things were right for me. So I figured that the way that I change the world is stick to what I believe in. Like you. You get it? I get it. You're not going to Papeete. I can't go to a place I can't pronounce. How am I gonna tell Harv where I am? Listen, have the hotdog on me and have breakfast, too. And have a wonderful trip, will you do that? All right. Thank you. Wait. You know that tape, the Haydn? It's a favorite of mine, too. Maybe you'll play it from time to time, huh? Since when did bookies start giving away Christmas presents? There's a lot of competition out there, a lot. You gave this guy, Roy Zabanco, a stereo tape deck. Roy, he lost 85 grand. I don't want to leave a bad taste in his mouth. It's not as expensive as it sounds. I get them wholesale. Hey, maybe you'd like a stereo tape deck. What's your first name? You want a stereo tape deck? Listen, I wanna get out of here. - You know, time is wasting... - Would you excuse me just a moment? I'll be right back. Don't go away. - Bert. - Yeah. Murray Feldmar, the bookmaker we picked up the other day. His collection book. Dan O'Connell, credit line $50,000. Last year he exceeded that by another $50,000. Total $100,000 credit line. Feldmar's Christmas list. Dan O'Connell, M.D. Nineteen-inch color television set, serial number, cost. Yeah. So what? Well, that name seemed a little familiar to me. So, roster of personnel, St. Joseph's Hospital. Dan O'Connell. - And he would only make about... - $80,000 a year. Go for it. It wouldn't be too difficult for him to siphon off $5,000 or $10,000 worth of class two drugs during a code blue. It's not him. No, huh? Morphine, Demerol, Percodan. - Let's get him. - I know where to find him. Oh, no. Not again. All right, give it up there. Oh, Wally, please, you're breaking me, man. Excuse me. - Wally, how're you feeling? - Oh, I'm on a roll, another winner. - Doctor. - Yeah. May I talk to you outside for a moment? Sure, you can. I'll be back, Wally. Hey, you changed your mind about dinner? I wish I could. But I'm afraid that you're busy. (DOOR OPENING) Hold it! Come on, you're not gonna jump. You want to lay me odds, Sister? Oh, well. Only suckers bet on long shots. I'll start the paperwork on Dr. Dan. In the ladies' room. - What? - In the ladies' room. Christine, I want you to notice something here. I did not clean up the bathroom. - What? - Well, I wanted to, in fact I started to, but then I made myself stop and wait and sit here for you. What the hell are you talking about? Where have you been? Do you know how many people have been worried sick about you? I'm sorry for that. I never meant to worry you. - You're sorry? - Yes. Are you all right? Chris, I want to try and tell you what happened, because you don't walk out on a partner, right? There's days I wake up and the kids are fighting, and Harv is complaining 'cause I can't find two socks that match, and the case we've been working on is falling apart, and I think to myself, "I can't do it. That's too much." And then there's days I wake up and the kids are fighting, and Harv is complaining 'cause I can't find two socks that match, and the case we've been working on is falling apart, and I think, "God, I love this life." You know? So. I called Harv, he's home waiting for me. And I'm gonna go there, I'm gonna tell him what I just told you. I'm gonna go on vacation for a week, and then I'll be back. - All right? - Yeah. Just don't expect me to clean the bathroom while you're gone. (DOOR OPENING) I remembered the pizza. - Harv, you wanna talk? - Up to you. I only need to know you're home. Good morning. Good morning, one and all. Good morning, Christine. How was your week off? I recommend it. I recommend it highly. Christine, we had the best time. Is that my desk? I never saw my desk so clean. Here, take this. - Remember Sonia? Our buckle collar? - Yeah. - She's out on bail. - Well, that figures. Sent this over to you. "May you never find a moment's rest or peace of mind." She could be wrong just once. You got time for shooting the breeze, huh? I want to see some work around here. Nice to see you, too, sir. Welcome back. OFFICER: For you, Mary Beth, on two.
