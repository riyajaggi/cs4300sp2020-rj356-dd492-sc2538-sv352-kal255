 Nothing up here. How about you? - Negative. - PETRIE: Sta y in touch. If anyone's tiptoeing through the tulips, I'll let you know. All right. You think these clowns are ever gonna make their move? Hey, they got a duty to their public. What about all those high school kids who can't make it through the day without their help? I made it through high school without dope. Or sex, believe it or not. - You had God. - I had nuns. PETRIE: Suspect sighted, second floor. White male in black leather jacket. Shorter white male, brown jacket. On our way.

 Police officer. - Hold it! Don't do anything stupid! - Hold it right there! (PHONE RINGING) 14th Precinct. Detective La Guardia. Sure, hold it. Manelli! Hello? Hey, where are you guys? I'm starved. Sorry, Joe. We got a break at the flower market so we're hung up here. MANELLI: What kind of collar was it? I don't know yet. It's either dope or smuggling roses. Anyway, we still wanna follow up on that counterfeit ticket lead. You got it. How about after we have lunch? No, we won't make it for lunch, kid. How about in front of the garden at 2:00? Okay, but I'm telling you, Mary Beth, this restaurant is a Manelli four-star find. We'll take a rain check. All right. Uh-oh. Pay dirt. (EXCLAIMS) Hey, you wanna get a bite? I was thinking Japanese. Real men don't eat noodles, Manelli. Hey Joe, the softball line-up looks terrific. Cool it, here comes the secretary. Lieutenant wants to see all your 61s from last week. - Yes, we know, Shelley. - So if you know, where are they? Okay, everybody on the team has gotta sign this. Put your name right next to third base. Okay. All right, where's Chris Cagney playing? On the sidelines. Oh, she doesn't know about this, and she doesn't have to. Don't you think she'll catch on when you guys disappear at 3:00 in the afternoon wearing spiked shoes and carrying baseball bats? She'll think that we're on patrol in the Bronx. Look, you think girls take this game serious? You think they wanna practice in March? Play pepper when it's freezing? Take infield when the wind's blowing dirt in your face and you can't even feel your feet? You think I do? So, when do we sign up for softball? I haven't heard anything. Are you filing the DD-5 or am I? - I am. I type faster. - Oh, I was hoping you'd say that. Sure, they're gonna have a Precinct team. God, I can't wait, Mary Beth. I love softball. - Are you gonna play? - You're kidding? - Why? - With Harv going on, and the renovation work, now, where am I supposed to find the time? Come on, Mary Beth. Work with us on this one. Christine, I can't. I'm supposed to take Michael to the dentist later. I'll tell you, that was one good thing about Harv being super in the building. What? You had a built-in babysitter? Yeah, and a cook. And on a good day, he might even clean the oven. I'm happy for him, you know. He's wanted to go into business for himself for a long time. So we'll work it out, we'll juggle our schedules. We'll adjust. - Well, you'll adjust, kid. - No, no. Harv will have to make an adjustment, too. Sure. He'll have to adjust to me being a wreck. You got it. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (GUNSHOT) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) WOMAN ON RADIO: 10-13, 44 and 8, 44 and 8. Police officer needs assistance. All units respond. - Car 11 responding. - Go for it. Out of the way, man! (SIREN BLARING) (TIRES SCREECHING) LACEY: All right, gangway here. Officers coming through here. Thank you, thank you! - Here we go, it's us. - CAGNEY: Coming through. All right. LACEY: Out of the way, please. - Who is it? - Joe Manelli. - Can't be. - Oh, my God. - Why? What happened? - A guy walked in and shot him. Close range. See what you can get out of them. - Well, you want me to ask somebody else? - I'm doing it. Let's go. Move it, come on. Dear God. Plates went flying, people were running all over, it was like somebody set off an explosion in here. How you doing? A cop... A cop gets killed right in front of me. You think you're safe. You're not safe anywhere. We know this is a traumatic experience, Mr. Caswell. Would you like to sit down? Look, I could get you something. - You want a cola? - Oh, yeah, thank you, thank you. I'm sorry, I'm very sorry. Excuse me, miss. Do you know what we're supposed to do? - The man said to wait. - But we have to get to our music lessons. It's important that you stay, please. I'll get your statement. Anybody speak English? Okay, Spanish? (SPEAKING SPANISH) All right. (SPEAKING SPANISH) From the back, terrific. What the hell is that? Lieutenant Samuels? Some suit from the mayor's office. Terrific. Just in time for the evening news. Is that right? REPORTER 2:...anyone else? Just the one policeman? REPORTER 3: So, we got a cop-killer on the loose out there, right? Butcher. All right, we'll try it again. The man... (SPEAKING SPANISH) Big guy, comes in the back. All right. He obviously didn't expect it, right? Probably didn't even see the guy, am I right? That's the picture. Cagney? You were working on a case with Manelli, right? Yeah. Counterfeit tickets for the fight. - Yeah, well, see if it relates. - Okay. PETRIE: Did you get out to see Evelyn? Jeez, yes. I went out there with the chief. And I want all of you to go out there and pay your respects before tomorrow night. - Sure. - Don't put it off. - Okay. - Okay. La Guardia. LACEY:...it's important. If it wasn't, I wouldn't ask it. I don't know, 45 minutes, an hour at the most. Harv, I know this is absolutely the wrong time. Michael has got to go to the dentist, and I can't get away. Everybody is staying on their own time... I know how you feel. It's like when Dave Bellamy slipped off a girder when we worked on the 19th floor. No, Harvey, it's not like that because that was an accident. This was not. What, did you know this guy? We were working together. Look, are Michael's teeth gonna fall out or something if he doesn't go today? Honey, it takes a month to get an appointment with this dentist. I just got Mikey psyched up to go. Look, have Mrs. Harris take him, huh? Harvey, you know she can hardly walk. She can only stay with him until I get home. HARVEY: Call somebody down the hall. How about Cynthia or Mrs. Barberi? You want me to call? No, I'll call. Thanks, Harv. Bye. Come on. Hello, Michael. Let me speak to Mrs. Harris. She's sleeping. Okay. Good news, we don't have to go to the dentist today. Yeah. Yeah, you can keep the $2. Michael, I need you to cancel the appointment. Find my address book. You know where it is. The big kitchen drawer. Dr. Ingram. You make the call, Michael. I have to go. You can do it. Michael, bye. Bye. Sir. SAMUELS: You all know Deputy Chief Inspector Brent. Sure, whenever there's a spotlight. The Commissioner is incensed about the tragic shooting of Officer Manelli. He's making this investigation his number one priority. This Precinct is going to be temporary headquarters, and Lieutenant Samuels is gonna report directly to me. Sir, you can tell the Commissioner that everyone here is working off-duty hours on his or her own time. - We want this bad. - Very well. And I wanna remind you, the murder of a police officer brings the death penalty in this state. So no one has to be trigger-happy. Besides, the press will be breathing down our necks looking to protect this guy's rights. So when you apprehend him, call the D.A.'s office immediately, strip him, take his picture to prove he ain't been brutalized. - And he better not be. - SAMUELS: Everybody got that? And another thing, we're setting up a hotline here for information. You'll all be fielding questions. - How much can we say? - BRENT: Don't give them too much. Don't tell them the name of the weapon or nothing like that. Our big fear is imitators. There's mucho head cases out there and they all want their name in the papers. So let's not help them out. Understood, sir. In case any of you think this is political horse manure, let me put it straight. We want this guy as bad as you do. An assault on one of us is an assault on all. - Harvey? - HARVEY: Yeah. - Got any cash? - What for? They're taking up a collection for Evelyn Manelli. Yes, sure. I'm going out there tonight. The new babysitter said... She said she could stay until I get back and then if it's late, she'll give the kids their supper. - Sounds good. - No, it doesn't. Her name's Bertha. Sounds like she weighs 600 pounds or something. She's a very nice girl. She's got brothers of her own. Well, she probably sits on them to shut them up. Squashes them like a bug. (PHONE RINGS) - Hello? - HARVEY: Come on, cut it out, guys. Yeah. - Shelley, I'm on my way there right now. - Hey, cut it out. Knock it off. I'll stay as late as they need me tonight. - MICHAEL: Squashes them like a bug. - Okay. What did you say? - What is the problem here? - We don't want a babysitter. Well then, instead of throwing food around, just say so. Okay. (BOTH MOUTHING) BOTH: We don't want a babysitter. All right, all right. Come on, you guys. You gotta help us out here. Your mother and I each have jobs of our own now as well as taking care of you. As much as we want to, we can't be home when you get out of school anymore. It still doesn't mean we need a babysitter. We're old enough now. Yeah, well, you gotta prove it to us by behaving yourself when she shows up. Okay? I guess. Even if we did need one, we wouldn't want some dumb Bertha. Oh, yeah? Who would you rather have? You. Morning. What, Claudia have you going out last night for pickles and ice cream? (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) You see the papers? You mean the Knicks winning in overtime? You know, sometimes, you have the mind of a running shoe. I mean Joe Manelli. Every politician's jumping on the bandwagon. Yeah, I saw the chief on the tube last night. He was calling out for more money to hire more cops and bulletproof vests... Yeah, yeah, same old story. Yeah. So, what have you heard about the first game? It's been postponed. They had to move practice back about a week. What game? What game, Isbecki? I'll see you outside. (DOOR SHUTS) Isbecki. - Isbecki! - Gotta go, gotta go! - What game? - Softball game. But forget it, the roster's filled. We've got all our men. And how many women? Hey, you're too late, the team's full already. No, no. How many women, Isbecki? Hey, let's be honest. A co-ed game just isn't the same as a regular game. How do you know? Well, I've never seen a woman play as well as a man, that's all. You wanna bet? Sure. - You wanna arm-wrestle for it? - Don't tempt me. Investigation hotline, Detective La Guardia. You say Myron killed the officer? He's been planning it for weeks? How do you know this Myron? He's your landlord. I'm an accountant. And what were you doing at the Japanese restaurant, Mr. Caswell? My office is right across the street. - You go there a lot? - Not anymore. - How close were you to the suspect? - Two tables away. No, at least six. You were sitting at the same table? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Did you see what he was wearing? - A plaid jacket. No, it was camel hair. - You said he had a shoulder bag? - A purse, a man's purse. Well, I wouldn't call it a purse. More like a satchel. Uh-huh. - Excuse me, ladies. - Go right ahead. Have you two been over to see Evelyn Manelli yet? Well, no, not yet, we've been kind of tied up... All right, fine, fine, fine. When you go, I want you to check on his family, the apartment. Would you look for conspicuous consumption? I wanna know if Manelli's been spending money recently. In case he was on anybody else's payroll. And see what you can get from the widow. OFFICER: Hey, Lieutenant, the D.A. wants to talk to you. - Sir? - Yeah, okay. - Sir? - Yeah? - This is supposed to be a condolence call. - Yeah, so be discreet. Ladies. (BUZZER SOUNDING) WOMAN: Such a shame. He loved the... LACEY: Hey, Brooks. Hi, Brooks. WOMAN: I'm all right. Thank you. - I don't wanna do this. - Thanks very much. - I mean, what do you say? - Say the obvious. "How much did the sofa cost? "Did you buy it before or after your husband started taking bribes?" Please. - Mary Beth. Chris. - Yeah. Thanks for coming. - I can't tell you how awful I feel. - Please, - I just can't stand to hear it again. - Okay, okay. But I appreciate the sentiment. You shouldn't try and do anything for a while, Evelyn. - You know, don't put pressure on yourself. - Do anything? I'll tell you what I do. I wake up in the morning and cry. I make the kids lunch and cry. I answer the phone, cry. I'm really terrific at it, I gotta tell you. You're terrific, period. So, where's the brilliant police work? And why haven't you caught the bastard? We're looking into every possibility. - Just seems to go so slow. - I know. Did Joe ever get involved with a perp, I mean, anyone that held a grudge against him? Do you know? I don't think so. I mean, Joe wouldn't play a tune on anybody's head. He just did his job. If it was a clean bust, it was a clean bust. He didn't hassle anybody. He seemed like a very gentle person. Yeah. He'd collar a vagrant and he'd wind up giving him a dollar for a pack of cigarettes. (CAGNEY LAUGHING) - It's true. - Oh, I believe it. I love your sofa, Evelyn. Where'd you get that? Oh... Discount place on the Island. - I'll take you there sometime. - Super, love to. And I got a backache you wouldn't believe. So let's not waste time. La Guardia, tell me about Joe Manelli. He and his wife had accounts in two banks. Nothing over $8,000. What'd you find at his house? A cop making $25,000 a year. Just trying to get along like the rest of us. - What about the ticket counterfeiting? - Turned out to be punks from Jersey. Scalping tickets at the door. Not a big deal. Petrie, what do you got? I ran down all the collars he made in the last six months. If they weren't in the slammer, they had alibis. Isbecki, you trace his beat? - Find anybody holding a grudge? - Clean. Joe had a good relationship with everybody on his beat. No problems. Sir? Did anybody bother trying to ID the killer? Forensics found the gun in some trash behind the restaurant. Did we get a print? The murder weapon was a six-shot.38 caliber revolver. Print-resistant tape had been fixed around the grip and the trigger. - ISBECKI: So the guy was a pro? - That's a hit man's trick. Yeah, but we got lucky. This came up just a few minutes ago. They were able to find a print off the barrel. Arnold Cream. PETRIE: The guy was sloppy. Well, he's a smalltime wiseguy, he pulled some jobs in Florida. Records are sending over his rap sheet right now. Doesn't make sense. Lacey's right, it doesn't make sense. On one hand, we got a picture of Joe, a beautiful guy that everybody loved. On the other hand, we got a professional killer, Arnold Cream. Now, assuming that Joe Manelli is as clean as all of you say, why was a mob hit man gunning for him? LACEY: Uh-huh. Martian invaders. Yeah. Sir? Sir... Sir, this hotline number is for information regarding the shooting at the Ichiban Restaurant only. Sir, call Bellevue. They'll know what to do. I don't know the number, sir. I'm sure it's in the book. Thank you. SAMUELS: Isbecki, I got something for you. I'm helping Petrie get through his 402s on Manelli. La Guardia, do me a favor, will you? The Assistant D.A. was just busting my chops over some cases he needs wrapped up right now. - What have you got, Lieutenant? - Mostly witnesses who ducked out on a grand jury. See if you can track them down. - What about Joe? - This has gotta be done now. Do it! Investigation hotline, Detective Lacey. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Got a last known address on Arnold Cream. Dino Lampella, that's Cream's uncle. Read it. On my way. What about me? - Was I talking to you? - Well, no, sir... So, get busy. (PHONE RINGS) Investigation hotline, Detective Lacey. - I just wanna say... - Talk to my lawyer. Not exactly undeserved, my friend. And the league kick-backed our application. Don't kid about that. - The league turned us down? Why? - League rule. Each team shall have members of both sexes. No women, no softball. - Who said Arnie lives here? - No one, Mr. Lampella. But your apartment's on record as having been his last known address. Well, he ain't here, so go bust the Welfare thieves on the corner. Hey, look. I'm just trying to be fair. A man's home is his castle. Okay, so I'll get a warrant. How about I run wants and warrants on your car, too? Maybe the IRS would like to take a look at your tax returns, what do you think? Just remember, huh, a man's home is his castle. - Hi. - How're you doing? Look, I wanna ask you a few questions about your nephew, Arnold. He's in some pretty serious trouble. (LAUGHING) Arnie? Not Arnie. Believe it or not, Arnie. MAN ON TV: Now you just can't tell if Powell was rea dy for this. Ma ybe just waiting for Diprio to... Now, have either of you heard from him recently? Please understand. Arnold, your nephew, Arnie, has been implicated in the murder of a police officer. Is he dead? I said murder, yeah, that's dead. I meant Arnie! Arnie's the alleged killer. His parole history shows he's been living on and off here for the last few years. We ain't seen or heard from Arnie in a long time. Must be years. - I know he lived here 11 months ago. - That's years. Oh, come on. The kid exaggerated a little, and right away you think he's a liar. A man was killed. He had a wife and he had children. And now he's dead. Honey, I got problems you wouldn't believe. Oh. Here's my card, in case. - Hi, babe. - I'm not in the mood, okay? Hey, come on, Chris, I got a peace offering. Hey, hey. I was wrong. So I apologize. - What's the come-on, Isbecki? - Well, look, I can admit when I'm wrong. Some of the guys were talking to me. They said I wasn't fair. Hey, look, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. If you wanna play ball, you're more than welcome. What do you say? You in? A Baby Ruth? There's hope for you guys, Isbecki. Real hope. - Hiya, teammate. - PETRIE: You mean you're gonna play? Sure. I'm gonna play. Chris, you saved us. Thanks. What's to save? Come on. Okay, guys, what's going on? Well, there's a sex rule. Each team has to have both men and women to be in the league. Yeah. Today wasn't a very good day for it, Isbecki. Hey, Chris. Hey, Chris. Hey, Chris! What happened was that... I got it. Christine! Chris? What? You suddenly get sensitive or something? I tell you, it was such a lousy, just a crummy thing to happen, Mary Beth. Hey, Isbecki isn't worth it, all right? I don't give a damn about Isbecki or his softball. I know. Petrie told me what happened. No. See, I'm talking about Joe. What? I was talking to some people today, you know, about Arnie Cream. Then I told them Joe's dead. And they didn't care. You know, they didn't even care. So? Forget it. They're jerks. What if we'd gone with him like we'd planned? We didn't. - Hell, he was just unlucky that's all. - Right. - Forget it. - Right. - LA GUARDIA: Cagney? - Yes? - Call coming in, you wanna take it? - Yeah, I'll be right there. It's late, and I'm hungry. You wanna split a pizza with me? No, I... Least I can do is go home on my dinner breaks. My kids are liable to forget what I look like. All right. - LA GUARDIA: Cagney. - Yes? - Are you taking this call? - Yes, I am, thank you. I'll be right there. LACEY: What do you say, fellows? - Your favorite lady is home. - In here. So? Some kind of greeting, huh? I come home from work today, kids are alone eating dinner. This is dinner. "Where's the babysitter?" I say. Mikey tells me she never showed up. - I'll call her. - This ain't gonna work, babe. So I won't call her. We'll get someone else. Right. So we can find the kids eating cookies for dinner again? What is that? - What are you mad at me for? - I'm not mad at you. We're just gonna have to find a way to work this out, that's all. We get a responsible babysitter. They do exist. I think what we need is for one of us to be here. You mean one of me. Well, you know, we cut back on the overtime a little. I'm not even getting paid any overtime for this, Harv. Nobody is. - We're doing it because it was Joe. - Yeah, I know, but... You're your own boss now, why don't you cut back? Do you see people banging on the door to hire me? There is not a lot of work out there! This is a real showpiece job. I can't pull back now, either. Well, then, we got a problem. - Good morning, Mary Beth. - Says who? You look like hell. Split me in half, my life would be perfect. So? Your life is half perfect. Which half, Chris? Hell. I'm just trying to get along here. You guys got time to help me run down a few loose ends for the D.A.'s office? - I don't know. - It won't take long. - What do you need? - Just a few phone calls. I've got eight names here, we'll split them. Pick one. They're both alike. - Thank you. - Let's see how many hours this takes. Tony Robinson, Peter J. Caswell, Barbara Abrams and Patricia Marie Brown. Wait, wait, wait. Back up. Who was that? Peter who? Caswell, Peter. J. He witnessed Joe's murder. I talked to him. You sure it's the same Peter Caswell? You read the file. Why was Caswell subpoenaed before the grand jury? He was an accountant for a couple of shipping firms. The D.A. found out they were mob controlled. He figures they're using it to shelter dirty money. So he wanted to hear what Caswell had to say. Maybe somebody out there wanted to keep him from saying it. Maybe so. Think this through. Joe's in the restaurant, Caswell's in the restaurant. Arnie Cream walks in, pulls the trigger. And the wrong man dies. LACEY: Mrs. Caswell, we could really use your help here. I told you before, Peter didn't know anything about the subpoena. He was at work, and it just came. What about the threatening phone calls? Peter said they started the very afternoon the subpoena was delivered. Where is your husband now, Mrs. Caswell? He's hiding. Why did the District Attorney subpoena Peter? He didn't know mobsters owned the company, he just handled the books. Well, Peter's in danger. He really should turn himself over to us as soon as possible, Mrs. Caswell. Peter is so frightened, he won't even tell me where he is. Mrs. Caswell, if someone out there... Heaven forbid, but if someone out there is looking for your husband, you could be in danger yourself, especially being home here alone. That's just what I needed to hear. - We could put an officer in your house. - No. - Or parked outside in a car. - Absolutely not. Let us protect you, Mrs. Caswell. I don't need protection, Peter does. And I won't have the police around to frighten him away if he decides to come home. All right. Do us a favor. If he calls, will you try to persuade him to turn himself in? For his own good. - Yeah. Okay. - Thank you. LACEY: She shouldn't be alone. We'll get protection out there by 6:00 tonight, that's the best we can do. Yeah. - Mary Beth. - Victor. Chris. Look, if you're waiting for me to apologize... Nobody's waiting for anything, except maybe for you to stop wasting the air. Look, I may be a jerk, but there's a lot of guys there. I mean, if you don't play, they can't play. We're supposed to be on the same team, right? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Hang on. - Cagney. - What? Got your boyfriend again. Line two. Which one? Romeo. Says he's got just what you need. Detective Cagney. (BEEPING) Brought help this time? Excuse me. Come on, kid. You really think that's gonna stop me? Oh, I'm falling in love. - Look... - What're you doing? - Hey, hey! Not so rough, huh? - Cut it out! Tell it to me. You got the 40, tell it to me. Huh? Hey, look, man, I ain't nobody's punching bag. Look, you got something to say, kid, you just say it. - Give everybody a break. - All right, all right. My old man got good and sauced last night and he let out that Arnie's living in a place above Premium Cleaners on 45th. That's your 40. I run a clean place. I don't go with any sordid carrying-ons. We understand that, Mr. Mankowitz. Guy looks good to me, I let him have a room. Guy's in a beef with the cops, I want him out of here. - You're sure he's not here? - Sure I'm sure. He left maybe three hours ago and he ain't been back. I'm downstairs all the time. Nobody gets past me. Would you just stay right there, Mr. Mankowitz? Arnie! Termite control. I'm telling you, he ain't there. BOTH: Police! You see? Thank you. - Looks like you were right, Mr. Mankowitz. - Sure. - Got something here. - Porno? Hotel receipts, gas receipts. Name on the credit card, Liam O'Bannon. Probably stolen. I told you. Nothing gets past me. Here we go. Car rental. Lacey here. I want an APB on a vehicle wanted in connection with the shooting of an officer. Brown four-door sedan, license 845 N-O-B. Right away. Thank you. Mary Beth, look at this. It's Caswell. Cream's marked all the incoming streets to his neighborhood. He's drawn the shortest distance to the turnpike. - And he's on his way to Caswell's house. - Yeah. Hey, what do you think about me getting my name in the papers? Live in hope. She went to the market, right? She needed a couple of things and she ran out for a minute. Hey, Mary Beth, look. Excuse me, ma'am. Over here. I'm Detective Lacey, this is Detective Cagney. - We're from the police. - Hello. You know where Mrs. Caswell is? She left a few minutes ago. Did she say where she was going? I didn't talk to her. I was doing the inside then. I just saw her leave with that man. Do you remember by any chance what he looked like? Big, I think. I mean, tall, dark. Something wrong, isn't it? - How about the car? - Brown, I think. Regular four-door sedan. - You know which direction they went? - Towards the city. Thank you very much. (CAR ENGINE STARTING) Thank you. I got an APB update on that brown four-door sedan. License number, 845 N-O-B. Do not apprehend. Unmarked vehicles only. This is a possible hostage situation. - Which is faster, the tunnel or the bridge? - Bridge. WOMAN ON RADIO: All units copy. Alert on license number 845 N-O-B.

WOMAN ON RADIO: Suspect has just entered parking structure on 95 and 1. - Tricia. - Not yet. - You're hard to find, Peter. - I got the money. I've got $5,000 here. I can get the other $20,000 right away. - I'm not interested in your money, Peter. - What's wrong? Twenty-five grand. You know, that's 10 times what they paid me to do you. Life just ain't worth much, huh? Arnold, we had a deal, the money for me and my wife. Here, here. You promised. You're stupid, Peter. I don't believe this. I'm not in the mob. I don't know who they are or what they're doing, and you're gonna shoot me, for what? (SIRENS BLARING) (GUNSHOT) - Freeze! - No! No! This is the police! (TIRES SCREECHING) Around here! Go around!
