 Doc Martin (2004–…): Season 5, Episode 5 - Remember Me - full transcript 
 Joe Penhale is shocked when his ex-wife Maggie,seemingly amnesiac and believing that they are still married,arrives in Portwenn. Not to upset her,he plays along but eventually has to seek Martin's advice. Martin also treats fisherman Paul Hale,an old flame of Eleanor,who has Addison's disease but Louisa is shocked to find her mother is still playing the field. Heavily in debt Bert Large falls in with the local loan shark but at least Louisa and Martin get round to naming the baby - James Henry.

 Father! What have I told you? I think I've found one! A pale clouded... Martin? Always knock before entering. Sir. Then go outside AND KNOCK! (BABY CRIES) Morning. You know your Venetian glass tumbler? Yes. Sorry. Oh... Let me help. No, no. I've got this. It's all right.

 No, really. (SIGHS) Actually... here. Oh. Right. Morning. What are you doing? Just checking he's sanitary. He is. No, not with the baby - with this. I've just spent the past hour arranging the school timetable... or did you think I painstakingly laid it out for decoration? It's a kitchen. We're about to have breakfast. But... (DOORBELL) (MUTTERS) Mornin', doc. What do you want? You need to register a name for your little'un this week. 42 days, that's the deadline. Just thought I'd give you the heads-up.

 Yes, I know that. If you fail to meet the aforementioned deadline, it will fall incumbent upon the state to name your baby for you. No, it won't. Really? It'll require the presence of the registrar superintendent. That's not as excitin'. Still, sounds like a lot of red tape, so chop-chop, get naming. Er, listen. I know you're probably gonna say no, but... I was just... wonderin' if you fancied getting a pint sometime. No. Mornin'. Up with the lark, boy! Gotta do our accounts. Don't worry about that. I got it all under control. Just gimme that. Oi, I'm readin' that! It's not the paper I want. It's what you're hidin' under it. It's just a bill, that's all. It's a final demand. I'll get it paid. (CHUCKLES) It's not been easy with you gallivanting up to Ruth every day. There's only one of me, and only so many hours in the day. Which is why I'm gonna get our accounts sorted. I said I'm doing it. But Dad, you've never been good with money. I'm your dad, and you'll do as I say! First thing in the mornin', you're treating me like an idiot! Dad - I'm talking 'ere! It's about time you gave me some of that, you know, respect. What do you know at your age? I know how to run a business! Now, let me get on and do it. Right? You're late again. And you're bleeding! Mind the carpet. Are you worried about me or your carpet? I stood on a nail, didn't I? Went right through my flip-flop. Right, go through. Hop! Not there. On the couch. Slide down. Not bad this. Another 'perks of the job'. Like getting free buns when I worked at the baker's. For all of three minutes. You're not gonna, are you? What? Throw up. No. Stupid that, weren't it? Doctor with a blood phobia. That's like me being scared of telephones or pens or summat. When did you last have a tetanus injection? I dunno. When I was little, probably. I'll give you a booster. N-No, you're all right. Won't take a second. (PHONE) Better get that. Mornin' rush hour! They'll want their appointments. I'll stick a plaster on it, yeah? 'Ey! Ellie! Who's that? It's me! You haven't changed a bit! Paul! (CACKLES) Paul? You all right? What's the matter? I think I'm all right. Perhaps not. Oh, my God! Ooh! Sorry, doc - Knock! There's an emergency. Some bloke's collapsed at the harbour. Here. Make an appointment with the receptionist. That's her. Aw, he's a cute one. Not like the doc's. What's his name? Boris. (GUFFAWS) No, really, what's his name? That is his name. Oh. I kept his hand down. Have you had medical training? To stop the flow of blood. Completely the wrong thing to do. One moment I was standing up, and the next I wasn't. Did you lose consciousness? Must have. Fell down like a sack of potatoes. Have you had dizziness before? No. What about your diet, been eating properly? Well, I skipped breakfast this morning', figured I'd get something after work. Fatigue? Do you get very tired? Well, I've been working hard, you know? I got an ex-wife on the payroll. Who'd you end up with? Susan Smith. No! I'm surprised she got down the aisle without leaving you for somebody else. (BOTH LAUGH) Stop talking. I heard last year... Mm? That she'd been friendly with half the lobster fleet. (BOTH GIGGLE) You probably passed out due to low blood sugar. You should always eat breakfast before work. You see? Nothin' serious. I haven't finished. Come to the surgery this afternoon - I'll dress this wound. Stay off work for at least two days. I can't do that! Fine, go back to work. Wait till the soft tissue's infected and I'll amputate your hand when it becomes gangrenous. Good trip? Excellent. Good. Although, I hope they'll bring back capital punishment for people who use their mobile phones on trains. Look, I found all this stuff in the barn. Oh, Joan keeps popping up everywhere. Yeah. What treasures has she hidden away for us? Well, this isn't going to get me through the bleak winter nights. Ooh, though this could. Joan was terrible at chess. Took all the fun out of beating her. Fancy a friendly, then? YOU play? What? You think I wouldn't play because I'm a plumber's son from the sticks? No. You wouldn't because you're young. You sound like my dad. Well, there are worse things. Most parents think their children are incompetent. And they frequently are. Not in your case, of course. It's the other way around, actually. I told Dad I didn't think he could handle the restaurant on his own. And, for some reason, he didn't see it that way? Mm. Anyway, I learned chess while I was travelling. Right, then. Tomorrow you're on! Ah-ha. Gotcha! I'm never gonna forgive you. Well, you could at least pretend to be happy to see me. We've had our problems, Joe, but... that's no reason to run away. It's pathetic. What are you doing here, Maggie? I looked like a right idiot. Going to the station in Bude and asking where you were. Honestly! But... But we split up, Mags. In your mind, maybe, I was pretty sure it was in yours, too. You're overreacting, Joe, as usual. If there's something wrong, we talk about it. You don't just pack up and disappear. I can't believe you're here, Mags. Your hands are cold. Bloody taxi was freezing. And it took me ages to get here. What day is it, Mags? It's the day you and I sit down and have a talk and get this straightened out. I mean, month and year. Don't be weird. It's just... police business. Tell me. OK? April, 2008. Any more silly questions? No. That's all. Thanks. Don't go running away again. I won't. It's serious, doc. Very serious. I've got a case of acute generitis. I beg your pardon? Generitis. A condition where someone is so generous it might be considered a hazard to their health. 200 quid and you can name my restaurant whatever you want. Get out. Think of it, doc, "Ellingham's". Your name out there for all to see - great marketing. You do not use appointment time to beg for money. 150 quid and you can name it after your son. Oh, what a lovely little christening gift that would be for the little fella. 100 - No! Next patient, please. Moving to Portwenn - you didn't think to discuss it with me first? I suppose you think you'll see more action out here. Maggie, I just wanna try and understand something here. You think we're still married? Er, no. I know we're still married. OK. Why are you acting so weird? Don't you erm... Don't you wanna be with me any more? Oh, no. I do. There's not a day passed that I haven't wished we were together. Well... Well, if that's true... why did you just move here without telling me? I... wanted to surprise you. Consider me surprised. Same old Joe. Never thinking things through. Well, if we are gonna live here, and it's still up for discussion... may as well look around the village. You can't! I'm on duty. Never know when I might be needed. Got your radio, haven't you? Yeah... So, we're good, then. C'mon. (CHILDREN SHOUT AND LAUGH) No running in the street! Hello, Joe. Yes, hello. Sorry, need to keep moving. Otherwise, we'll be late. For what? Sightseeing. Oh. What's he called? Well, we haven't decided on a name yet. All the more reason for you to go home and get to work on it. Joe, aren't you gonna introduce us? Apparently not. Maggie. Louisa. Maggie? Aren't you... Come on, Mags. His wife, yeah. If you'd have told me two years ago I'd be married, I'd have laughed my head off, but then this big old whirlwind dropped into my life... We don't wanna bore Louisa with our life stories. No, no. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Oh, it's so nice that Joe's making friends already. In Bude he had such trouble. Well... that was a long time ago. Er, relatively speaking. Oh, he's such a lovely baby. Thank you. Won't be long till we're starting our little litter. Eh? No, it won't be. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Nice to meet you. Likewise. Now, if I've overstepped my boundaries, just say. But I've found a list of the 20 most popular boys names last year. OK, Oliver, Jack, Harry, Alfie, Joshua... You've overstepped your boundaries. I'm just sayin', naming a baby needs a bit of thought. I'll give you that tetanus injection now. Er, I mean, was named after Saint Morwenna, Cornish saint. Died a virgin - so thanks for that, Mum. Yes, come through. No need. My foot's feeling better. That's not the point. Can't you just give me a tablet? No. Or a sugar lump. Just come through. Erm... Granddad is waiting at the bottom of the hill. I can't leave him. He'll go with anyone who'll feed him. It'll take 30 seconds. I have a little problem. OK, a huge one. I don't do needles. It's not gonna happen. Nonsense. I see one and I faint. Utter rubbish. Come through. Morwenna? Morwenna! Oh, for God's sake! What are you doing in here? Surgery's now in session. What medical complaint do you have? What? What isn't a medical complaint. Stop wasting me time. Get out. Out, out, out. I'm doing you. You've taken over my desk. Can't you do that in the kitchen? No. You said I can't work in the kitchen. You can work in the kitchen. Oh. Right, then. Just not at meal times. Lucky me (!) We should make some time later on to discuss the child's name. Right. Yes. I shall make an appointment. That won't be necessary. Today's your lucky day. I've come bearing gifts. Well, not gifts exactly, but items to sell. Let's have a peek, then. They were stuck in the attic, you know, in case of emergencies. I like to think of it as my insurance policy. 15 quid the lot. Did you say 50? 15. Oh, I've seen that look before. I'd like to help you out - I'm not here for a loan, Mr Tonken. (CACKLES) "Too soft," that's what they always say about me - right, Norman? Right, Dad. How much do you need? Maybe some other time. Just work out the terms and conditions with Norman here, and it's yours. Well, it's very kind of you, but I've got some other avenues to explore d'rectly. Well, if you change your mind, you know where we are. Right. How's the book coming along? Do you see me writing it? No. Then you have your answer. (DOG WHINES) I see Buddy came home, then. I think Martin sneaks him up in the night. Check. Hm. You've left yourself open. Maybe. Maybe not. Oh! Well, we'll just have to call it a draw. A dr- That was checkmate. I had you. Really? Yes. No, no, no, no, no, no. That can't be right. I'd leave that one there. I know that working behind a bar in Spain has given you a unique insight into timetabling for local schools, but actually I can manage. I did not work behind... I owned that bar! How very impressive, Eleanor. It's like you're a teenager again. Really? What would you know about that? Don't snap at me! I'm trying to help. (DOORBELL) Oh. That'll be for me. Not for you. Of course not. Hiya. You ready? Starvin'! Mum? Where are you going? I thought you were staying for dinner. Paul's gonna treat me to Portwenn's famous fish 'n' chips. Sorry. Caught the fish myself. Not today, I hope. What? Oh. No. Resting up, doc, just like you said. Don't worry. You haven't made an appointment. I still need to change that dressing. Doc... we got plans. Have a word with you man, Lou-lou. Teach him some manners. I want to see you first thing in the morning. Not you. What do you think? I think your mother thinks she lives here. Look at the mess she's left! She's treats it like a hotel. No, about Paul. I think they're on a date. Do you know what the worse thing is? I'm actually a bit jealous. She gets to go out and have fun, and I'm stuck here at home. With a baby. And you. But in a good way. It's so nice to have a lie-in. Oh, remember his hat. I have. Well, before your day gets frantic... what do you think of this? What would you like me to think of it? That peach would be a good colour for the living room. For that one? No, our living room. In London, when we repaint. That's all been done. I had a contractor take care of it. When? Three weeks ago. Well, would you like to tell me what colour our new home is? Or would you like it to a surprise? It's brilliant white. Throughout. How very clinical of you. Yes, I thought it was expedient. Course you did. It's nice of you to fit me in. I'd like to say I produced these eggs myself, so to speak. But I didn't. The girls won't cooperate. Well, you're not exactly the farming type. They're chickens. They lay eggs. How hard can it be? Do you still play chess? No. I played a game with Al. Bugger beat me. I hope this isn't the first sign of mental decline. It could be. You're not getting any younger. Hm. Thank you for that (!) He was every bit as good as you. I doubt that. I used to play postal chess with a murderer from Southend-on-Sea. Until Al, he was possibly the best I'd come up against. Though, he had a tendency to make rash moves when cornered. Much as he did in real life. How was London this time? Noise, crowds, heat, pollution. I loved it. Quite a culture shock coming back here. I suppose it'll be the same for Louisa. Only in reverse. She's been to London before. I can't imagine she enjoyed it. No. (BABY GARGLES) You shouldn't stay together for his sake, you know? I didn't know that we were. (BABY CONTINUES TO GARGLE) Your son is trying to get your attention. There, there. (CLEARS THROAT) (BAWLS) Ssh! I learned that in Broadmoor. Mm. Yummy. Just warming some stew. I'm not talking about the food, dummy. What are you doing? I thought... you might be hungry. Mm. Mm. Would you like a... slice of bread with it? Do you really think we should be doing this? Oh... God! No! We shouldn't. Why, what's wrong? I just remembered... I gotta go and do something. I've missed you. Me, too. Stop. What? It needs more. The stew. Maggie... please. (PHONE) I've gotta get that. MAN: 'Hello, this is a message for PC Joseph Penhale. I'm looking for your ex-wife Maggie. I tracked you down through the Bude station finally, and Maggie's sort of gone missing, and... Well, I dunno, but if you hear anything gimme a call. Oh, sorry. This is Tony Crawford, Maggie's boyfriend. Well, I was her boyfriend, until the other day. So, anyway, call me if you see her. Thanks.' (HANGS UP) Mags... do you know a Tony Crawford? No. I don't think so. Why? Who is he? Nevermind. I'm just saying, it's a bad sign. Not being able to chose a name is not a sign. Anyway, how was your date? What date? Well, how many have you had since last night? The one with Paul. Oh, that. Yeah, very productive. So, were you at school together? Yeah, he had a terrible crush on me. That boy would've done anything for me... maths homework, English homework. Was that a disapproving look, miss? No, not at all. You seem much happier being back here now. Yeah. I suppose I am. Well, how often do you have memory lapses? Not sure. Can't remember. (CHUCKLES) You know, I did get kicked in the head by a horse once. Maybe it's that. Unlikely the condition would take this long to manifest itself. What's the date today? August 18th. Where did you go to school? St Petrocs. Who was the first female British prime minister? I didn't realise this was a quiz. Just answer the question. Hm... I... don't know. Because you can't remember or you're struggling? Doc, I do the pub quiz every week. Hardly like a question about Mrs T would stump me. So, you do remember. I... do now. Yes. But before... I didn't. Sort of. What if I can remember most things, but there's a patch which I can't? Then I would refer you for an EEG or an MRI scan. No, no. No need to go to any trouble. Thanks, doc. I won't waste your time again. I very much doubt that. Any luck? I found something in the pots! Help! Help, somebody! Man overboard! Man overboard! Help! (PHONE) Dr Ellingham's surgery. Right. Yeah, OK. OK. Doc? No! I'll knock later. You have to go. Out of the way. All right, let me. Billy pulled him out the water, doc. But he was dead to the world. Not dead. You know what I mean. He's not breathing, Martin! Yes, I can see that. Anyone called an ambulance? Well, don't just stand there! (COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS) What you doin'? His skin. That's not a suntan, it's hyper-pigmentation. Has he been craving any foodstuffs lately? I dunno. Salt in particular. He had a ton on his chips last night. Does that mean anything? Maybe a severe adrenal deficiency. What? I'll give him a hydrocortisone injection. (PHONE) Dr Ellingham's. Get me Morwenna. Ah, I might have sent her out to get some baby things. Go to my medicine cabinet. 'On the left-hand side, a small bottle of hydrocortisone.' Hydrocortisone. Right. OK. And meet me at the harbour. Thank you. Here. Right. Out of the way! He's in good hands, Mum. (BREATHES HEAVILY) (COUGHS) What are you doing? I just restarted your heart. And then I gave you a hydrocortisone injection. Does that mean I'm good to work? Of course not. Doc - Apart from nearly drowning, you also have Addison's disease. You what? Your adrenal glands aren't producing enough steroid hormones. Don't understand a word. You have a condition that can be contained with tablets, but you'll need to go to hospital for a few days. Did you understand that? And you won't be able to go back to work for at least two weeks. Sorry, El. Didn't mean to let you down. Hey, you can visit him in hospital, Mum. Paul? Why would I wanna do that? I can easy find someone else. Well, that's a bit harsh, isn't it? Setbacks are a part of any business. What are you talking about? You didn't think I was going out with him, did you? (CACKLES) You are such a romantic! There's a huge demand for shellfish in Spain. I was dealing with the suppliers, and he was catching the fish. Least, he was until his hand slowed him down. You weren't putting pressure on him to go back to work, were you? No! Course not. I just told him if he wasn't up to the job, I'd find somebody else. Mum, did you come back here for us or for business? Well, two birds, one stone - know what I mean? Morwenna? I was just about to do something, whatever that was. Take a seat. You can't give me an injection against my will. Spores may have entered your body and produced a poison that causes a spasm so violent it can fracture your spine. Don't sound so bad. Unless you let me give you this injection, I will fire you. That'll do. Right. That didn't hurt a bit. I haven't done it yet. Agh! £1,000. Sure that'll be enough? Don't want you running short, now. That'll be fine, thank you. You'll be able to pay it back? It's a capital investment. Spend money to make money. I feel bad for the small businessman. Ignored by the banks, left to fend for himself. I just don't want there to be a problem with repayments. There won't be. Of course there won't, Norman. (CHUCKLES) He's a worrier. I think I've made such a mistake. It's only a timetable. With Mum. I told myself I'd never trust her again, and then... (SIGHS) Nevermind. I don't suppose you want to get out for a while for dinner? No. Nope, didn't think so. We've got nothing in the house, you know? Fine, let's eat out. You sure? Yes. OK. Who was the first British prime minister? I don't know. OK. I mean, first female British prime minister. Why are you asking me this? There's something we need to talk about. Talk, talk, talk! I'm beginning to think that's all there is to you. No, don't think that. I've changed. You promised me so much. You said it would be a roller coaster. And I meant it. I mean, I mean it. We'll go out. Tonight. The two of us. Dinner, dancing. Whatever you like. The most romantic night of your life. In Portwenn? Whatever it takes. What about James? Hm. Is that a good or a bad grunt? Henry. Mm, Henry. My grandfather's name, an accomplished physician. He gave me a frog to kill and dissect on my fifth birthday. James was also the name of my grandfather, and he was a postman. I see. Don't say "I see" like that. It doesn't make your choice any more valid. I didn't. What if we use both names? Henry James? James Henry. No. Martin! What? Oh. MAGGIE: Hi. What are you doing? We should ask them to join us. Absolutely not. Are you doing that because I prefer Henry James? I would never be so petty. Really! Hi. Hello, there. Doc, Louisa. Nice to see you again. Well, sit down, join us. No, no. Don't want to bother you. Well, it's no bother at all - really. Hey. (CHUCKLES) Thank you. And who's this? Martin. Martin, this is Maggie. Hi. Yes. Joe? Are you gonna sit down? Erm, OK. BERT: Right, now. I'll be back shortly to take your orders. Well... this is nice. I see you found the rest of 'em. Yeah. I did. Now, before you saying anything, I've spoken to the bank, and I've arranged an extension on the overdraft. Everything's gonna be just fine. How are you gonna pay that back? You're doing it again. Sorry. Sorry, erm.. You've been doing this a long time. I should show more faith in you. That's fine. Oh. That means a lot, does that. Don't worry. Everything's under control. So, you must tell us how you met. It's not much of a story. Well, he came into the salon where I was working. All dressed up in his police uniform. I thought he was gonna arrest me. He was just after a haircut. A very nice one, too. So, when did you get back together? When I tracked him down. Idiot. Just moved here without saying a word. Baby names. What have you got? Any closer? Well, we're considering a few. Which ones do you like? Henry. That's a great name. I love it. Henry Ellingham. "Hello, Henry. How are you?" Like I said, we're just discussing it at the moment. Why do you keep rubbing your hands? Oh. Just a bit chilly. Yes. It is a bit chilly. Someone should speak to Bert, get him to drag a heater out here. Actually, I was just thinking how warm it was this evening. Is the rest of your body cold? Doc, really! We're trying to order our food. Now is not the time. It's just my hands. Why did you say that PC Penhale had just moved here? Because he has - Doc, that is enough now! All these questions - really! So, her hands are a bit cold. It's not a crime. I should know. And sometimes people just wanna eat... food, and not be asked things and more... things! Come on, Mags. Why are you acting like this? Me? It's him! Joe, what are you doing? When you came to my surgery earlier... It wasn't for me. No. It was for Mags. What do you mean? I'm sorry. But you were gone so long, and... then you came back. I just wanted one more day. Right, now. Are you ready for your puds? Now, 'death by chocolate' is - Well, it's simply to die for. Any headaches, nausea or vomiting? No. Can you remember where you were this morning? At the police station. And last week? Well, I thought I was... I thought I was in Bude with Joe. But... (SIGHS) I don't understand. How can it be years later? Do you have a history of migraines? Erm... I used to get them when I was younger. The occasional one now. Lights off, curtains closed, have a lie down. I'm sorry. This is just... so weird! What's the last thing you clearly remember before coming to Portwenn? I woke up in the flat. And... half the wardrobe was empty. And all Joe's stuff was gone. He'd left me. I didn't. Not then, not now. You left me. I did? You said you were bored, stuck. You left and I did everything to try and get you back, and... it didn't work. Can we get back to the matter in hand, please? You met someone else - Tony. Worked across the road from the salon in that car repair place. I don't know anyone called Tony. An inability to remember people or events can be a facet of transient global amnesia. Are you being serious, Joe? Or is this one your stupid games? I'm being serious. I phoned Tony just now. Apparently, you were gonna marry him, You found out he was seeing someone else and you kicked him out. They weren't my clothes in the wardrobe, Mags. They were his. This doesn't make any sense. We're married. We're not. Not any more. It does make sense. Episodes of transient global amnesia can be traced to physically or emotionally stressful incidents. It doesn't last more than a few days most often. Your memory will come back, and it's not harmful. That depends how you look at it. I lied to you, Mags. I should've brought you here straightaway. I know you must hate me now more than ever. I should. Maybe I will, but... I know you love me, and... I know that... I'm not sure what I know. Tony wants to come and collect you. No. If this happened because of... W-What did you call it? Er, an emotionally stressful incident. I'd rather stay here. Until everything comes back, and... till I can work out what to do. Right. Just to be on the safe side, I'll book you in for a brain scan tomorrow. Poor Joe. The man's a moron. Deliberately concealed a seriously ill woman from me for his own benefit. Well, yes. But it was sort of romantic. Idiotic. I agree. But still. I don't know why I'm even discussing it with you. You're hardly mister hearts and flowers. Well, forgive me if I think that taking advantage of a person's medical condition isn't the height of romance. We still need to register a name by tomorrow. Actually, I've er... filled in the form already. No, Martin. I thought it had gone on long enough. You had no right to just go ahead and decide our child's name. Well, it's done now. I'm sure James Henry will be happy with it. James Henry? Yes. Thank you. Hm. Hello, James Henry. Make sure you get the crook of your arm under his head. Yep, I have. And support his back with your forearm. Yep, I know how to hold a baby. Yes, I know. Just giving you some advice. Martin, shut up. Yes. Are you calling me fat? Ellingham, anyone who upsets my Maggie upsets me - and I really don't think you wanna do that. Do you want me to jump down? No! All right! All right! You stay up there. Itfc subtitles
