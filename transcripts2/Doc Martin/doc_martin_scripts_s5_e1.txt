 Louisa. Hello, Martin. I know that you heard about my job in London. You might have told me first, I do have a right to know. I am carrying your child. Oooh! Congratulations, it's a boy. It's a boy. It's a boy. Oh! Oh, yes. Ooh. That's all perfect, Miss Glasson. There's no reason why you can't take the baby home. Erm, Martin's got to be in London.

 Oh. Oh, dear. That is a shame. Well, we'll organise something, shall we? Yes. Yes, thank you. I'll drive you. I've got a bit of time, if you like. Yeah. Yeah, that'll be good. I'm looking for Louisa Glasson. She had a baby about an hour ago. I wonder if you should come to London, now there's a baby. There was always gonna be a baby though, wasn't there? I mean, I was pregnant. Yes, but it's different, now that it's here. Is it, Martin? Yes. Gotcha! You can run, but you can't hide. Hello, Joe.

 A little boy, yeah? Fantastic. Who's the daddy? Oh, that's really kind, Joe, but I'm gonna hold him, actually. Then you'll be a law breaker. No, she's just the accomplice. It's the driver commits the felony. Nick of time, eh? Terry? It's my dad's name and my grandpa's middle name, but I'm not sure he looks like a Terry. What do you think? Is it a bit...common? Too many Terrys already? So what about London? Hm? I don't start work again for six weeks so, once you've got yourself settled in, perhaps we could come for a holiday. It's not Portugal. No. Don't you feel that now he's actually here, that...it would be a bit inappropriate, to go back to work so soon? You are. I mean, they'd manage without you. They'd manage if you died. Crikey. You only moved out this morning. Hm. Put him to bed I should think, wouldn't you? He hasn't got a bed. Why not? It's a flat pack. I haven't put it together yet. He can sleep with me. Erm...best not. Oh? You might roll on him. I don't think I would. It's... Here. Just jiggle him. Jiggle him up and down a bit. Infants are twice as likely to suffer sleep-related fatality in a crib as those who co-sleep in bed with their parents...or parent. Mm. Is it American? They have babies in America. Er, I think he wants you. What are you doing? I think he's hungry. Right. Hey. Erm, where's the...the bed thing? The cot? Ow! In my room, behind the curtains. Right. You're really good at that. It's not difficult, if you concentrate. I'm impressed. We're impressed, aren't we? Louisa? It's half the village. Hello, Doc. Hey! Hello, Doc. Yes? Congratulations. Well done, Louisa. Change your mind, then, Doc? Well, welcome back. Louisa was caught unawares and I'm doing the best I can. So you're stopping, then, Doc? No. Don't say you're going to London, Louisa. What? Oh, I don't know. It'll be term time before you know it. Bit of a puzzler there, then, eh, Doc? She wants to be here, you want to be there. It's none of your business. Right, everybody, let's give 'em some space, eh? Show's over. Louisa... Bye-bye! Hm. Can I stay? Just for tonight? It's a long journey and it's getting late. Oh, yes, of course. If there's room, that is. I'm sure we can manage. Nappy cream. Three more minutes, nappy cream. But he's so tiny. It's upsetting, I know, but he needs you to teach him. This is where it all starts. No. I'm sorry, Martin. If somebody cries, you give 'em a cuddle. I'm warning you, Louisa, if you cuddle that baby, it's the thin end of the wedge. Are you settling in all right? Thank you. Oh, it's lovely. Joseph Penhale, police officer. Doctor Dibbs, doctor. Obviously I'm a doctor. We weren't expecting a woman. No. But welcome to the district. Oh, thank you. You carry on. Thank you. Are you familiar with the work of the ISER? The what? The Institute of Social and Economic Research. Not really, no. Yes, apparently they've proven that the children of mothers who go back to work early develop more slowly emotionally, and perform less well in reading and maths tests than the children of mothers who stay at home. Well, that's one view, yeah, but not everyone agrees. Oh? I read something that said the opposite. Really? Where? I forget. A professor. Mm. American? No, actually, I don't believe she was... Thank you. Morning, Louisa. Are you still here, Doc? He's off this morning. Oh, look what I've got. Is that for us? Certainly is. That is so kind, Bert. It's just a loan, mind. Used to be Al's, mine before. Oh. What? Well, it's very traditional. Yeah, yeah. Look. Do you want to come in, say hello? Cup of tea would be lovely. Right. I'll go to the chemist. Oooh! Hey, Doc! Are you going for breast or bottle? What? Your boy must have cried half the night. Could it be colic, do you think? Hm... Does this one come in a gel? You came back. It's just a visit. Do you stock these items? For your baby? Yes. And some Paracetamol, 500mg. Are you sure, Dr Ellingham? It's for me. Oh. Dr Ellingham, the outgoing GP? Yes. I'm your successor Dr Dibbs. Call me Di. Yes. So do you have any advice? What sort of advice? Do's and don'ts for the new girl on the block. Don't use either of these. Your acne's beyond topical treatment. You need a subdermal corticosteroid. Mm. Do you think so? Yes. I'll get some in. Oh, thank you. Will you be staying long? No. Doc, have you got a minute? What for? Baby supplies? Doc, quick! Doc! Out the way! Right, don't move. Can you hear me? Yeah, I'm all right. It's my own fault. What's happened? Don't move. Any numbness? Can you feel your legs? Yeah, thank you, Doctor. They feel fine. You've cut your head, but your skull seems intact. Does it hurt anywhere else? No, I don't think so. Blooming lucky, yeah? What's the prognosis, Doc? You're probably going to be fine. Hold this. Keep pressing for about 15 minutes, until the blood stops. Frontal-parietal impact following a fall. Superficial laceration, but no obvious sign of a skull fracture, and no injury to the cervical spine. Still some pupil dilation though. What's his name? Hello, sir. I'm Dr Dibbs. I'm your new doctor. Now where does it hurt? My head hurts, but I'm all right. Doc! Oh. I've got this problem I'd like to discuss with you. Medical problem? Yeah. Well, it's a bit awkward really, this morning... She's your doctor now. As fast as we put 'em on, Al used to fill 'em up. What are you doing? Having a lesson, to make sure we're doing it right. Did you get the ones without chlorine? You want the ones without chlorine for sensitive skin. Oh, dear. Never mind. Just check next time. Here you are. Is that blood? Erm, yes, somebody fell off a ladder. Who? Oh, dear. Short, fat, asthmatic, late-50s, fisherman probably. Mike Chubb? Mike Chubb. Is he all right? Yes, the new GP's got it in hand. What's he like, the new GP? She. She's a woman. Oh. Fluoxetine? What? Insulin? Oh, these are the...new doctor's. How come? Honestly! Can I help you? The surgery doesn't open till tomorrow. Where's the doctor? Is it urgent? She's got my bag. You've got my bag. This is yours. Really? Oh, I'm so sorry. They must have got mixed up in the kerfuffle. I'll just get... Are you the old doctor? Di said you'd met this morning. Gavin Dibbs. What are you doing with the patient notes? Gavin's having a look at your filing system. Mm. The receptionist understands it. I wouldn't tinker with it. Pauline? Yes. Pauline's gone. No she hasn't. Well, she has, actually. Gavin's going to be my receptionist. Practice manager, whatever. So you saw my prescriptions, then? Yes. The Fluoxetine is only for emergencies. And the Zolpidem? She needs her sleep, poor lamb. Uppers and downers? You should make your mind up, but you're the doctor. If that head trauma doesn't make an appointment, look him out. Mrs Tishell will know how to find him. Mm. Hm. So where are you going? Why? Just thought we might go together. The thing is, we have a history, you and me. We go back. Though I'm sure this new doctor woman's very good, I'd rather get you, if I can. - I was looking it up on the computer - My complaint... and they said it could be a number of things. Yes? How can I put this? I'm not one for feeling myself, but... Official police business. PC Joseph Penhale, 3021. Yeah. Yeah. I'm on Trevarthen Street. Portwenn. I was just speaking to him, actually. Now, have you got everything, Doc? Yes. I'll be off. What? I suppose this is goodbye, then, Doc. Yes. So where was the new doctor? In the surgery? Yes. Must be weird, being there, but you're not in charge. I don't think she's quite got a grip on it. Well, no-one's gonna fill your shoes, are they? Pauline will lick her into shape. Pauline's gone. They've got a new receptionist. The doctor's husband. It all seems a bit amateur, to me. My goodness. Hello, Joe. Come in, then. Are you all right, Joe? I am, yes. What's up? There's been a bit of an accident. What sort of an accident? Where? At Bodmin Moor. Road traffic accident. Well, a single vehicle, so not really an accident as such, more an isolated fatality, you might say. Oh, dear. Someone from the village? It's your Auntie Joan. Really sorry, Dr Ellingham. When? Yesterday. Paramedics say it was a heart attack. She was just sitting there in her truck, in a gorse bush. Not a mark on her. They've been trying to contact the next of kin. They couldn't - and you're next on the list. No disrespect. PC Penhale 3021. Yeah, I just told him. Yeah. Understood. They need a formal identification at the mortuary. I could run you over if you like. Not run you over, I could drive you there, if you were feeling wobbly, which wouldn't be surprising. I'd be feeling wobbly and I've had training. Thank you, Joe. We'll call you if need be. I'm so sorry, Martin. 71. That's not a bad age. Well, Doctor... I do believe we are ready to start work. Yes. Oh, dear. Are we having an attack of the glums? No, I'm fine. I'm so proud of you, Diana. It really is unfair, the diabetes, as well as everything else, but you soldier on, eh? Hello. Doctor said to come and have my dressing changed. I fell off a ladder. Oh, yes, of course. She's expecting you. May I know your name? Mike Chubb. Mr Chubb, how nice to see you again. I'll just get your notes for you, Mr Chubb. I hope you'll forgive the mess. We're not really open until tomorrow. Very good of you to see me. Not at all. Not at all. It's a bit higher than we'd like, Mr Chubb. Yes, I've got pills for it. I wonder whether I shouldn't up the dosage. You don't happen to know what you're on, by any chance? Perindopril, 4mg, but I don't like 'em. Why's that? They give me a tickly cough. Oh. Oh, dear. Is that serious? No. No, but I could give you something else if you like that won't give you the cough. Mrs Tishell closes Wednesday afternoons. Oh, it's not urgent, tomorrow will be fine. Tomorrow? I tell you what, you can have some of mine and then I can give you the prescription for tomorrow. That's really kind of you, Doctor. Did you see her? Yes. Where are you going? Just to the shops for a few bits and pieces. Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. Is this thing clean? I gave it a wipe down. Are you sure you're all right? Mm. Aw, look at that. Brand-new, little family. It's disgusting. She only had the child to catch the father. No she didn't. What a nasty thing to say. Good afternoon. Hello. Oh, I'm sorry for your loss, Dr Ellingham. Yeah, what a shock. No, not really, no. Heart failure is the biggest cause of death in Britain. Yeah, but just like that, going about her business. There's often no warning if you eat too much and don't exercise. Recipe for disaster. Still...and she never got to see the baby, did she? Little boy, yeah? Oh, ain't he gorgeous? Isn't he? Got a name yet? No. No? Now, who does he take after? Well, Bert says he looks like Martin. What a beautiful child. My sympathies, Dr Ellingham. Yes. Thank you, Mike. How's your head? Oh, all right. New doctor's keeping an eye on me. Lovely woman. Got a pair of lungs on him, hasn't he? Afraid so. Did he keep you up? I wasn't sleeping very deeply. Pollen count's high. How are you doing, Louisa? Apart from Joan, of course. Yeah, great. Big knackered, maybe. Yeah, it's like being mugged, innit? First few weeks. Well, months, really. Yeah? Yeah. Are you sore? Little bit. Where? It's nothing. Where are you sore? Where do you think? Is it just the perineum? The what? The perineum, between the anus and the vagina. Martin, we're in a shop. Then let's get you home. I'll have a look. No, thank you. Preserve the romance, Dr Ellingham. You could see the new woman. Surgery opens tomorrow. Good, yeah, thank you everybody. I think we should do it now. They're not open yet, Martin. Tomorrow will be absolutely fine. Come on. It won't take five minutes. There you go. I thought I'd try without the tranquiliser. Oh? See how I do on my own. Oh. All right. That's the spirit. Well, somehow, it seems like cheating. Hello? It's the doctor. No, Di, you're the doctor. Are you sure? Mm. Hello? Can I help you? Is the doctor here? So sorry to barge in. We could come back later. Hello. Hello. Hi. I'm Louisa. Louisa Glasson. None-hospital birth yesterday, two weeks pre-term, complains of perineal pain and she wants to see a woman doctor. I'm sure it's nothing, just a bit sore. Gavin Dibbs, practice manager. I'm sure the doctor will be pleased to take a peek for you. Yes. Yes, of course. Go through. It's very kind of you. Not at all. So you're...still here, then, eh? Got yourself a promotion, Di says. London surgeon, yes. That's nice. It's interesting work. Though this is front line I'd say, general practice, the sharp end, as it were. Mm. Are you married, Martin? No. Thought as much. Must be hard, that, in your trade. Di says she couldn't manage on her own. Yes, it's been a long and winding road, but she only finished training last month. Late bloomer. She's gotta be 50. Well, she's her own worst enemy, when it comes to exams and that. She's highly strung. She always puts her heart and soul into the task at hand, then along comes a test and that little voice starts up in her head. Nag, nag, nag and whoosh! She just forgets it all. Everything all right? Could you give us a moment, please? What have you found? Well, there's nothing jumping out at me. Are you managing? Is there anything you want to ask? She's a doctor, Martin. I'm sure she's got everything in hand. Hm. Difficult to let go, yes? Has she been failing exams for 30 years? Oh, good lord, no. She was happy enough as a nurse for the longest time, but, well, then we met and I saw at once what was going on. She... Didn't even know she wanted to be a doctor, so we set to work and it has been my privilege to see her through. A few hiccups along the way, but we got there in the end. Everything all right? Any tears or lesions? Everything looks lovely. Thank you. I feel better already. Another satisfied customer. I'm so sorry for the fuss. Not at all. It's better safe than sorry, eh, Dr Ellingham? Oh, Dr Ellingham, what's your view on Metformin use in Type Two diabetes? It's just that Di's been feeling a couple of degrees under for a while. We were wondering if the Metformin is out of balance with her insulin injections. - Are you monitoring regularly? - Yes. But her glucose is all over the place, isn't it? Well, it's not really. We reckon it's anxiety. It'll probably pass after she's been here for a week or two, eh? Have you had any medical training? Me? No, no, no. No, total layman, but I read the trades and you pick things up, don't you? No. How many medications are you taking altogether? Erm... Oh, where to start? Erm... A few, then? She's got a lot of ailments. Poor woman. Related or discreet? Pardon? Are they derived from a common cause or are they separate? Mm. Er... Shall I examine you? Examine me? Yes, you don't seem on top of things. She's... She's likely more au fait with current thinking than you are, Dr Ellingham, having qualified more recently. Be quiet. You're probably over-medicating. Would you like me to examine you? I'm all right, thank you. It's your funeral. Come on. Thank you so much for putting our minds at rest. Mm. Look, he's just a great, big snob, love. You're 10 times the doctor he ever was. I could come up for specific days, if need be. Yes. All right. Speak then. Yes. Goodbye. How was that? They've waived the formal induction and Corbett's agreed to take my list for a week so I can stay here until the funeral. I could go to a hotel, or something. No, no, here - here is good, while things get sorted. Sorry. No, that's really, really good. Now that you're not pregnant, you could eat a bit less. You're still his nutritional provider, so you'll have to be careful, of course. Normal rules apply. Fruit and vegetables and so forth. You'll need vitamin supplements. I'll get those from Mrs Tishell. It's never too early to get a grip on bad habits formed during pregnancy. Breastfeeding will help use up fat stores. Louisa? Louisa? Well, Doctor, our first official patients are here. Shall I let them in? Surgery is open. Well, you're a bit bigger than ideal, I'm afraid. I know, I just can't shift it. It's like climbing a mountain. Mm. I know. So what do you think? Renew the anti-inflammatories, maintain the hypertension medication, step up the diabetes medication and give you something to make you feel a bit more cheerful, perhaps? Oh, thank you. Oh, hello, Joe. What's she like? Absolutely lovely. Nothing's too much trouble. You're next, Constable. What are you in for, Joe? Joseph Penhale. Ah. Hello. Hello. The thing is, I've got a lump on my scrotum, and I looked it up and they said it could be a number of things, but it could be, you know, it could be it. It could be fatal and I should get it looked at. I'm sorry, but you're my doctor now and there we are. A lump? Well, it's probably nothing to worry about. It's probably just a cyst or a hydrocele. Nothing to worry about. No? Don't you want to have a look at it? Right. Take off your things. I never like this bit. Are you gonna...have to touch it? Worse for me than for you. I'll have a think about it, come back another time, yeah. Thanks, Doc. Get out. Doc? Doc? Quick! Medical emergency. Please, Doc, just a quick look. Go and see your doctor. She didn't wanna see it and I've got to know, is it a benign hydrocele or is it a cyst or is it...you know? On your testes? My danglers. A bit tender? A little bit. Give us a minute, Nigel. It is a cyst. You should have it scanned anyway, to make sure. Thanks, Doc. Martin? Martin? Could you confirm the first line of your address please? 12 Treemain Road. And have you had this medication before? No. No. And why is that, Mrs Bollard? I don't know, Dr Ellingham. Yes you do. You've already damaged your liver and until you get your alcohol consumption under control, Diclofenac will make it worse. The new doctor said I could have some for my ankles. She's wrong. Put it back. What's yours for, eh? This won't do you the slightest bit of good. We've been through all this. Yeah, but I got a second opinion. Did you? What's yours for? Come off it. What's that? Prescription. What's it for? What? Go through. Have you got your inhaler? Where's your inhaler? Oh, God. Yes, that's it. Where's your inhaler? Where did he get these from? I don't know, it was certainly not from my shop. I have been... ..using it a lot. Mrs Tishell? It's all right, Mike. Ambulance is on its way. He doesn't need an ambulance, he needs an inhaler. How many have you taken? I don't know. A few. Where did you get them from? They can be lethal to asthmatics. Dr Dibbs gave them to me. Right. Out of the way. And if it hasn't gone in a couple of days, try doubling the dosage. Mr Trivet. Could you just give me a moment, Gavin? Morning, Doc. Yes. I need to see the doctor. I'm afraid she's rather busy at the moment. I don't care, I need to see her. May I ask why? No you may not. I just need to see your wife. Is there a problem with that? If you could be more precise in your inquiry... She has been handing out beta-blockers to an asthmatic. Well, is that a problem? She could have killed him. But there's some sort of misunderstanding, please. Let's not be hasty. Give her a chance, she's a wonderful doctor. She's a terrible doctor. Let go. Dr er...Dibbs, open the door. Open this door. Open the door. I need to speak to you. Hello, Mike, have you seen Martin at all? Yeah, he's gone up the surgery, to see the new doctor? With the baby, yeah? No, Joe Penhale took him. What? Dr Dibbs, will you please open this door? If I may. Di? Di. It's me, love. Precious, are you all right? Dr Dibbs? Oh, leave me alone. Have a seat. For God's sake, woman, you're gonna collapse. Told you. Diana. Diana? Speak to me, my love. Get her bag - her doctor's bag - get it! Dr Dibbs, what medication are you taking? What medication are you taking at the moment? What's she on? Fluoxetine, Zolpidem, Metformin and insulin, right? Yes. Anything else? Beta-blockers for her blood pressure. Statins for her cholesterol. Tetracycline and Isotron... Isotron... Isotretinoin? For acne, yes? I think it's for her acne. Raloxifene for osteoporosis and, sometimes, Alprazolam instead of Zolpidem, just to help her sleep, poor lamb. OK. We're just taking your blood pressure, love. What happened? Doc Martin chased her. Call an ambulance. Roger that. Joe? Joe! What happened? Hello, it's me again. 3021. Oh, for goodness sake! What is it? What do you think that is? Stretch... It's your stretch marks, love. - It's Cushing's Syndrome. - We're on top of it. What's Cushing's? Doctor is on the scene. Well, two of them, actually, but one's a patient. Not content with mistreating her patients, she's been misdiagnosing herself. What's Cushing's? Cushing's Syndrome, it presents as multiple diseases when it's only one. Excess cortisone. It can be fatal. A proper doctor would have spotted it. Could you tell me your ETA? I'll relay that information. It's all right, love, he's cured you. No I haven't, I've just restored her blood pressure. She's going to need surgery. You need surgery, love. Gavin... It's all right, my love. It's all right. Gavin's here. Gavin's here. That was quick. Did you cancel the one you called for the fisherman? All right, love. Thank you. There we go. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm coming with. Take it easy, Doc. Good luck. Don't worry, Mr Dibbs. What a shame. Such a nice woman. Thanks, Joe, for looking after the baby. Er, yes, good. Mm. We should take him home. He must be hungry. Yes, righto. Er, clear path. Thank you. Doctor, can you take a look at this? It's gone swollen and my hand's gone tingly. Can you make a fist? Not really. Is it serious? Not yet. Er... Er, you'd better come inside. I'll take a look at it. I'm next. I'm sitting here. I'll just feed him, while you're busy. Mr Hubble? Hello. I'm Ruth, Martin's aunt. My condolences, sir, at this difficult time. You're late. Joan would be pleased. Well, if she wasn't... Dead? Yes. A good percentage of the people in this church are clinically obese. itfc subtitles Sync and corrected by APOLLO
