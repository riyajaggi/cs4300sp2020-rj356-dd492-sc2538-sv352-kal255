 Cameron: I'm Cameron Black. I was the world's greatest illusionist, while nobody knew I had a twin brother behind the scenes. Until the night he was framed for murder. Jonathan: After the wreck, I tried to save her. She wasn't the woman from the car. This body was a different woman. I know it wasn't an accident. I was set up. Now I have to catch the mysterious woman behind it all. Are you ready? - And I need the FBI's help. - You're Cameron Black.

 With Agent Kay Daniels... I know a few tricks, too. ...and my team of illusionists, we might just have a chance. Life is often a matter of perspective. From one, we see normalcy. We're safe, content. Nothing bad could happen. Of course, that's a lie. If we could shift our perspective, we might see the truth. ♪♪ [ Indistinct conversations ] We're actually in grave danger. What?

 Or we're the butt of some practical joke. [ Laughs ] Got you. Problem is, we're forced to view life from one perspective. Is it a joke? Are we in danger? We can't know... [ Breathing shallowly ] [ High-pitched ringing ] [ Breathing shallowly ] [ High-pitched ringing ] ...until it's too late. Which brings me to... deception. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's your transition? Yeah. Now I go into talking about how my team of illusionists can help the FBI, and then we start to... What? You don't like it? Well, this pitch is never gonna work. Johnny, teaming up with the FBI, with Kay, that is our best shot of getting you out of here. Really? "My twin brother was framed for murder by a mystery woman with different-color eyes." It happened to me, Cam, and it sounds insane. They know she exists. They know she's dangerous. It'll work. Cam, let me be clear... I'm not relying on the FBI for this. I'm relying on you. And I promise you that we will figure out who this mystery woman is, we will prove that you're innocent, and we will get you the hell out of this box. Mm. That was way too confident. What is it? Nothing. I'm fine. You're nervous. That's good. You're better when you're nervous. [ Chuckles ] Run it again. Okay. [ Inhales deeply ] Where was I? Which brings me to... deception. An illusionist, like myself, uses deception to entertain, inspire. Criminals, spies, they use those same skills to steal... to cheat... perhaps even... to murder. Now, the very best, well... they'll make you think that there was no crime. At all. [ Exhales sharply ] [ Air hissing ] Which is why I am here... to show you something new, to... [ People coughing ] You all right? Y-You need a bottle of water, some lozenges? Is the smoke getting a little, uh... [ Smoke detector beeping ] ...[Coughs] thick? Yeah. [ All coughing ] Gunter! [ Smoke detector beeping ] Gunter: Damn smoke detector! Sorry. Uh, short commercial break. God, we've played stadiums, arenas. You can't handle a conference room?! [ Beeping stops ] Don't you dare, you finicky fop! I told him a thin mist, not the "Towering Freakin' Inferno." Nice reference. Almost as old as your smoke machine. I told you we should've gone with digital projection. - Shut up, you heathen. - O-Okay. Okay, boys. Dina: Fresh air coming in. Why am I watching a magic show? If Felix Ruiz used a criminal illusionist to escape from the FBI, maybe this illusionist is working for other criminal organizations. He's got a point. Cameron did help us catch Felix, and, uh, the magic is phenomenal. This is about his brother, isn't it? The twin. Jonathan. Jonathan Black. He was framed for murder by that same criminal illusionist. But you're the FBI. You got tons of cases. We could help. My team's ready to go. What do you say? [ Cellphones ringing, chiming ] - What is it? - What's going on? A case just hit. We've got to go. ♪♪ [ Sighs ] What do you think? Sounded like a no, but soft. - Yeah. - You still got this. Go get 'em. Go on. Go, go. Go on, son. - Kay, what about the pitch? - We'll finish later. Please. Come on. This is my best shot to help Jonathan. I get that, but Joseph Kline was murdered this morning. [ High-pitched ringing ] Poisoned in front of a hundred people in Astor Place. Who's... Who's Joseph Kline? He was a defense attorney for a number of criminal organizations... An expert in keeping mobsters and drug lords out of jail. He recently approached us in secret. He wanted out. DOJ was negotiating the terms. Mike, what'd you, uh... What'd you think of the pitch? - Oh, the magic was amazing. - That's good, right? Unh-unh. That's bad. You're never gonna convince Deakins with magic. He's right. The Special Agent in Charge doesn't need a show. She needs proof your team can help with other cases. Okay. All right. So how do we do that? We've got to get to the crime scene. I'll call you later. Wh... What'd they say? Cameron. What are you thinking? We're gonna solve a murder. ♪♪ ♪♪ Daniels. FBI. This is Special Agent Alvarez. - What have you got? - One Joseph Kline. He was killed with a liquefied poison. Clear, odorless. May be a neurotoxin, but our lab team says it's custom. They've never seen anything like this. [ Police radio chatter ] Whoever did this, they wanted to make a statement. It gets stranger. [ Camera shutter clicking ] We pulled these from the bank's security camera. - That's our killer. - He used a squirt gun? That's an UltraSprayer 3000. - What? I have two boys. - I don't get it. What killer wears an orange hoodie or uses a blue gun? It's like he wanted everyone to see him do it. - Beats the hell out of me. - He's performing! Cameron, what... What are you doing? Helping. Observing. Whatever the... technical term is. I need to prove to Deakins my team can help with other cases. - Who the hell is this? - That's Cameron Black. I told you I'd call. Don't worry. I cleared my schedule. Stop! This is an active crime scene. You cannot be here! Cameron, the body's still on the ground. Yeah, can I see it? No. You're going home. Okay. All right. But I'm right. How did you... See this guy? He's performing. The orange hoodie, the... the blue gun, even the way he's standing. He's cheating out. He's like an actor on the stage, right? He's standing so he can be seen better from a certain angle. What angle? W-Who's watching? The audience. Magic is angles. If I get the angle right, you see... ...this. If I get the angle wrong... you see that. Oh, you ruined the trick. Thanks, Cameron. - Watch out. He ruins tricks. - Not really. I mean, ruining a trick is kind of the worst thing you can do to some... Ohh, G... Oh, God. Okay, you take the NYPD and the coroner. I'll handle him. [ Exhales sharply ] [ Police radio chatter ] The first body's always the worst. Poison did that? Yeah, it's one of the nastier ways to kill someone. You all right? Oh, yeah. It's just... Oh, was your first body like that? No, it was an overdose. Totally different. Cameron, are you sure you want to do this? Yeah, yeah. I have to. It's just, uh... Unless you're sending me home. Not yet. If you're right and the killer was cheating out, it means there was somebody else watching. Right. Exactly. So, uh, if we look at the way he's standing... and he was there, which means the audience would've had to be... there. ♪♪ It's gonna take hours to canvass this. I mean, of all the spots in New York City, there isn't a single surveillance camera aimed at this one. Whoever was watching the murder didn't want to be seen. All right. So, what's next? We, uh, interrogate some people, shake down some bad guys? [ Car alarm chirps ] I'll admit I'm basing most of my procedural questions on crime shows, but I feel like we should be chasing somebody. Okay, most investigative work happens at a desk, going through paperwork. Clues aren't just gonna fall in our laps. Hey. I told you a hundred times... Stop throwing those planes at my car. You want me to call the cops again? Do ya? - What is happening? - This frickin' kid spends every morning throwing paper kamikazes at people on the street. - Somebody's gonna lose an eye. - Every morning? [ Doorbell rings ] Hi. We're with the FBI. How in the world are paper airplanes a federal case? They're not. We'd like to speak with your son. He may have seen something from his window this morning. He's home sick. Does he like magic? [ Siren wails in distance ] Okay, now, this is how you make a real paper airplane. All I'm gonna do is just... Uhh? You made a paper airplane out of thin air. [ Chuckles ] Phew! - And it works! - Pretty good, huh? Now, Max, this is kind of important, okay? Did you see anything down in the street this morning? Anything at all? Well, there was a movie crew. What movie crew? They were in a van. The back doors were open, and they had this guy with a camera, filming. Do you remember anything else? It was blue. And what's the picture they put on the van? The company's...? Logo? What did it look like? Well, it was like a circle in a circle, kind of this target with, um, a man running by it. [ Pen scratching ] Kind of like... Like this? Yes! Exactly! ♪♪ [ Engine revs ] O-kay. Do you always drive like this? When do we get to do that fun paperwork stuff? I put out a BOLO for the van Max saw. One with that logo was just spotted near Cooper Square. Why did they film Kline's murder? I don't know yet. [ Cellphone ringing ] Johnny. So, how'd it go? [ Inhales deeply ] Yeah. Oh, yeah. The pitch went amazing. Wait. Really? Well, still working out the details, but, uh... yeah, we're gonna have real help, Johnny. You know, uh, experts, professionals, all that. [ Shakily ] That's amazing. Thank you. You got it. I'll, uh... I'll call with updates. [ Tires screech ] ♪♪ We just got here. No sign of the van or the shooter. No. Three o'clock. Hey, I've got eyes on him. He's headed to the woman with the stroller. Subject's armed! Subject's armed! Got you! FBI! Stop! Put that gun on the ground! - Freeze! - Wow. This is intense. - Drop the gun now! - Wait. Do I keep going? - Put the weapon down. - Put your gun down! I don't... Does that mean I lose? They didn't tell me you were coming. - FBI! - What... Are we still shooting? - I'll do it! - Wait! Stop! Stop! Don't shoot! No shooting! Cameron, get down! Are you insane?! He doesn't know what's going on. I know why there was a film crew. Cameron Black?! Are you part of the show? Does that mean I won? He thinks it's a TV show. Yeah. You did it, bud! Congratulations. Now you can lower your gun and collect your prize. - Okay. What'd I win? - We... [ Man grunts ] Cameron: Geez. What the hell was that? That? That's entertainment. I don't understand. What did I do? I-It was a game show. I didn't really shoot anybody. It was... It was just water. "'You're Dead!'... A prank game show where you shoot other contestants before they shoot you. After each hit, you win money and prizes." It was fun. T-They told me where to go, showed me pictures of the other players like, uh, the jogger. Uh... what happened to him? He's dead. Poisoned by the water in your spray gun. Wait. That... That's from the, uh, wa... That's from the water gun? Mike: Noah Hawthorne, 19. Recently moved here from the Midwest. Traffic and personal information match up with records back in Wisconsin. This story is insane. If he is telling the truth, that's not murder, right? He's still here? He helped us find Noah. He pulled the trigger, Mr. Black. Unless we find the person who tricked him and they confess, Noah Hawthorne's our killer. Kay: Who chose you to play the game? Uh, the producer, S-Steven. I, um... I don't... I don't remember his last name. What did he look like? Um, he was a regular guy. He talked really fast. There were others, but... but they all answer to Steven. And where did he recruit you? At Times Square. It was my first time there. They promised me a fun time, a chance to win money. I mean, I could use it, but... Wait. I am... I am not a killer. I... I'm from Wisconsin. ♪♪ Dina: Okay, I hope we've all done our homework, 'cause we need to become murder experts A.S.A.P. I downloaded the NYPD and FBI's crime stats, cross-referenced them with commonly reported motives, then I created an... Okay, no, no, no, no. Jordan, no. Murder is more than just numbers. It's about human psychology. Didn't I tell you to read up on Agatha Christie? Yeah, I looked her up on Twitter, but I couldn't find her. Maybe, uh, I spelled it wrong. I hope you got further than that. Cameron is relying on us to help him solve this case. I got three ideas... Two messy, one clean. Oh. Ideas about what? Ohh! No. Gunter... Well, you said study up on murders. With the purpose of solving them, not committing them. Oh. Got it. I got to make a couple changes. Dina: Yeah. Kay: I'm sorry, Ms. Olovsky. Why would someone want to kill you and Joseph? We can only help if you talk to us. [ Russian accent ] Joseph and I worked together. I was a-a bookkeeper. He was a lawyer for my boss. We started seeing each other two years ago. We kept it secret, of course. Then... things changed. We decided we need to get out... A new life for all of us. But there's no getting away from our employer. Who were you working for? I never met him. Only associates. They would whisper his name. "Sasha." Deakins: We're after Sasha Sokolov, people, head of the Russian Syndicate. Bridget Olovsky worked for him. Joseph Kline was his lawyer. They wanted out, which means Sasha ordered their deaths personally. The killer was this man, Noah Hawthorne. Sorry. Question. Uh, who is Sasha? There's no... no picture for the board? He's Russian mafia. Nobody's ever been able to identify him. He's a ghost. Sasha's outfit is the toughest in New York. He's notorious for having his own people killed when they fail him. We connect Noah to Sasha, and we've got our ghost. - Find him. - Uh, yeah. W-What about Noah? I mean, he's a victim, too, right? We don't know that, Mr. Black. All we know is that he shot Joseph Kline in the face with poison this morning. [ Chuckles ] Okay, sure, I-I get that his story's extraordinary, but, still, it's the only thing that makes sense. You... you get that. They forced his perspective. They made him think he was on a game show, just like Johnny was made to think he was in a car crash. Easy, Cameron. Yeah, no, I get it, but he's innocent, right? I mean, I know that, you know that. I see the personal connection, Mr. Black, but the FBI is not about personal missions. We solve cases based on evidence, not emotion. - Well, sure... - He gets it. We'll run down Noah's story. If there's any truth to it, we'll find out. Let's start in Times Square. ♪♪ So nothing out of the ordinary? Really? Nothing? Okay. Thank you. So you didn't notice anything at all? Even though you've been standing here all day? So, the shooter is described as a 19-year-old male. Orange hoodie. Did either of you...? Last description I have was of a blue squirt gun. Hmm. No. Haven't seen him. Nothing? All right, so, the dance team and the creepy Statue of Liberty didn't see anything. We spoke to most of the regulars. And everyone else, they're just... they're tourists. Like Noah. Wanted to see the lights. All right. I get Sasha's plan. The less your killer knows, the better. It's smart. But why a TV show? Because there's a camera. You want to control someone? Put 'em on TV. They'll say things they don't mean, do things they would never do. That's why they had to film. Noah had to know he was on camera. 'Cause nothing bad can happen; he's... he's on TV. You don't watch the news, do you? No. It's too depressing. Let me demonstrate. Ah. Excuse me. May I? Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. My name is Cameron Black. And as part of a new television spectacular, I am here demonstrating my newest trick... Woman: Ooh! ..."The Decapitator." Now, who wants to lose their head? We do! I do! Oh, I want to! All right, now, this may be dangerous. Woman: I like danger! You might get hurt. - Oh, me! - Please! - This is a real sword. - All right. Point taken. What now? Well, now I have to decapitate someone. Magically, of course. - Hey! Give me Excalibur! - Sorry. [ Laughs ] You Hollywood types come around here and think you can just take over? I've been in this spot for five years. Now everybody trying to push me out... Morning shows, cooking shows, hack magicians. - Okay. - Reality prank shows. Wait, wait, wait. What reality prank show? What did you see? They came through the other day looking for volunteers. The man in charge, uh, the producer, was his name Steven? Yeah, but his guys didn't call him that. They called him Kos. I think these guys was Russian. [ Telephone rings ] Is that him? That's the guy. Are we upgrading from magicians to medieval knights? [ Laughs loudly ] Sorry. I didn't think anyone was gonna laugh. I was just trying to... Great joke, boss. Willy Shoemaker, a.k.a. Lancelot, saw the reality crew in Times Square Noah described. Steven, the producer, is actually Mikhail Stefanovich Koslov. Mikhail's a captain in Sasha's syndicate. Noah was telling the truth. We need to be certain. Get Noah to corroborate the I.D., and we'll get the warrant. [ Exhales deeply ] Not bad for the Deception Group's first day, huh? Noah, I need you to tell me if this is... Damn it. I need a medic! So Noah was tricked into being the real killer by this Russian man and his fake prank show. Mikhail Stefanovich Koslov. Right, but we can't prove that he's the real baddie, because Noah is poisoned and in hospital. That poisoned water got on him when he sprayed Joseph. Just a drop on his hand. Noah boy's gonna die slow. That almost sounded sympathetic. What about an antidote? The poison's custom, so only Mikhail would know it, and we can't arrest him until we have Noah's positive I.D. I mean, it's... İt's unbelievable. We know who did it, but we can't arrest him, 'cause the FBI has all these... rules. Uh, they call those rules "laws." Eh. Yeah, are you allowed to just walk around with these files? This one says "confidential." And that Mikhail, he don't look like a killer to me. Well, it says here that he's part owner of Molotov, that super-hip nightclub. And it's Friday night. He might be there. That's good. That's good. We go to the club. We see if we can find Mikhail or something that connects him to Noah. That's the hottest club in town. And I'm Cameron Black. And I'm sure you're not famous anymore. Okay. I think we'll be fine. [ Dance music plays ] - Excuse me. Sorry. - Who are you? Hello! Hello! Hi. So, um, Lonnie told Jen and Mike that we'd be here in 30 for drinks with Rodger on the balcony, but Rodger's being Rodger, so excuse me if I sound a bit frazzled. Oh, my word. Your eyes are the dreamiest shade of blue. Um, I think we're under Arthur Mandrake. Dina: Thank you. Gunter, tip him. Boom. Thanks, man. Appreciate it. [ Dance music playing ] I haven't been in a club since Jonathan. Oh, yeah? Was that club filled with professional killers? You win. You're the more exciting brother. - And a better dancer. - [ Laughs ] Keep an eye out for Mikhail. These gangsters have got nothing on me and my mates in the war. Remind me. What war was that? I don't want to talk about it. [ Monitor beeping ] [ Coughs ] - [ Breathing shallowly ] - Noah? Noah, can you hear me? Is this the producer? Is this the man who recruited you? Thank you. [ Telephone ringing ] Deakins: Deakins. We've got a positive I.D. on Mikhail. [ Dance music plays ] Looks like the VIP room's the place to be. If Mikhail's here, he's down there. Darling. Launching your comeback's gonna be very difficult if you're dead. I got to do something. Noah's gonna die from that poison or rot in jail for 20 years. Is this about Noah or your brother? Bit of both. Gonna help? Never could say no to you. Or Jonathan. So, what's it gonna be... Lucille Ball or Marilyn Monroe? - Love your Lucy. - [ Chuckles ] - [ Shrieks loudly ] Ohh! Ah! - [ Speaks Russian ] Dina: [ Chuckling ] I'm sorry. Oh, gosh. Oh! [ Dance music continues playing faintly ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Hey. How ya doing? [ Russian accent ] This members' area. You can't be here. I... Right, yeah. I'm... I'm supposed to meet a Mikhail here. Do you know him? This Russian club. Lots of Mikhails here. [ Chuckling ] Right. Of course. He also goes by Kos. Does that ring a bell? Yes. But can I give you a bit of advice? You don't want to meet him. Go dance with the children. [ Man speaking Russian in distance ] [ Door opens ] ♪♪ [ Man speaking Russian ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Cellphone ringing ] [ Whispering ] Kay. Kay: Cameron, good news. We've got a warrant for Mikhail's arrest. Mike and I are heading to his club to pick him up. Great. I'm already here. At the club. Well, in the garage. I found a door in the back room. Led to the garage. Anyway, Kay, the blue van is here. [ Door opens ] - So is Mikhail. - Man: Hey! - Gotta go. - Cameron, what's happening? [ Grunts ] Okay. Easy on the jacket. [ Click ] Cameron: Okay. [ Chuckles nervously ] [ Grunts ] Who are you? I'm Cameron Black. The magician? Cameron Black? I had a show. It was... It was pretty big. Nicholas, pick him up. All right. That's nice. Look, I just was in the club, got turned around. Wanted to make a phone call. This seemed like a good place. Yeah, you're wrong about that. I can prove it to you. [ Guns cock ] Oh. Okay. All right. Just cards. Just cards. I just wanted to show you a card trick, prove I'm a magician. That... That's it. [ Thud ] I hate card tricks. Uh, I got a good one with a cellphone if I could borrow your cellphone. Please? I dunno. He's been back there a really long time. He's fine. Boy walks through life with a halo around his head. Nothing bad ever happens. - This better be good. - Thank you. Okay. So, I have this, uh... I have this whole bit about cellphones, how they're, you know, driving us crazy, right? And then... [Clears throat] It's just... Unh! Unh! [ Snapping sounds ] - [ Speaking Russian ] - Eh? Pretty great, right? Why would you do that to my phone, Mr. Black? I don't understand. Ah. Well, because it, um... [ Chuckles ] You see, it makes this part really great. You watching? Cameron: Huh? How did you do that? Very impressive, Mr. Black. Thank you. All right. Well, this... this has been fun. [ Clears throat ] May I? Thank you so much. And, uh, see you guys on the dance floor. Wait! Still doesn't explain why you're here. [ Dance music plays ] - Where's Cameron? - He went back that way. There were guards... Scary ones with guns. If they start shooting, lot of people gonna get hurt. Don't worry. I'll get rid of 'em. Tell you what. I have a trick for you guys. This... You're gonna love this. If I just take this... This is a classic. So, all I do is just... Find him! [ Dance music playing ] [ Electricity crackles, music stops ] [ Clubgoers gasping ] Never leave home without Georgie. There was a man. He didn't belong here. Where did he go? Kay. [ Door closes ] - FBI! - Get down on the ground! - Get down! - Cover me. ♪♪ Kay: Mike! The exit! [ Tires screech ] I'm on it! ♪♪ [ Tires screech ] Cameron! [ Grunts ] Yeah. Hi. I could almost shoot you right now. Yeah, well... you're not the only one. I got his phone. You can't go on a search without a warrant, without telling us. - What were you thinking? - Noah's dying from that poison. - Mikhail has the antidote. - He did find his cell. Maybe computer forensic finds something. Mikhail's gone. Sasha knows we connected him to Kline's murder. He also knows Mikhail can prove he ordered the hit. That means he'll have Mikhail killed, too, probably by his own men. Well, then we need to find him first. No, you're not finding anybody. This, whatever this is, was a mistake. Whoa. Kay, wait. Please. Why didn't you tell me what you were doing? You're an FBI agent. I didn't think you'd say yes. I would've figured out the right way to do it. Deakins is right. You took this case personally. Well, I'm new at this. That was my first body. When you found your first, the overdose victim, didn't you take it personally? I wasn't an FBI agent. I don't have time for this. What do I tell Johnny? Try the truth. The part I don't get, Cam, is why you thought the FBI was gonna help in the first place. They don't care about us. Kay's different. [ Buzzer sounds ] She's a cop, Cam. They put people in here. They don't get them out. What happened there? Nothing. Someone tried to steal Dad's coin. Couldn't be having that. [ Chuckles ] So you're still thinking about this Noah kid, huh? - You know he's a killer? - Yeah, but he's not, Johnny. He's just some innocent kid they made into a murderer. I had to help him. I just... Uh... [ Sighs ] I guess I went too far. That is kind of your specialty. Hmm. So, what now? I got nothin'. [ Chuckles softly ] You know, Cam, I see that look in here all the time... Guys just giving up. It's not a good look on us. It's kind of like the time you made us try guy-liner. Okay, I am not giving up, and a lot of guys use eyeliner onstage. And off? For a year? It was our Ziggy Stardust phase. Forget it. All right. So we're not giving up. So, what's the plan? [ Chuckles ] A plan. Johnny, I'm not breaking you out of here. We'll come back to that. Right now I'm talking about this Noah kid. I know how your brain works, Cam. And right now I kind of have a soft spot for framed killers, so... show me the plan. All right. To save Noah, we need Mikhail to confess to the Kline murder and give us the antidote to the poison. Now, it feels like a classic room switch to me, right? Yeah, if the switch is good, but you need a different out. You gonna do a Detroit Houdini? Yeah. Nice pep talk, by the way.

The neighbor said she's getting ready for a last-minute trip to Europe. No mention of Mikhail, but she texted his phone with flight times, all leaving today. He's coming for her. [ Radio beeps ] Anything yet? Back door is clear. No sign of Mikhail. Good work. When he shows, move in. Delicious, right? - Cameron! - What are you doing here? - How did you find us? - And what's this soup? First of all, I know you have absolutely no reason to hear me out, but, please, I have come up with a plan to get the antidote out of Mikhail. As far as how I knew where you were, well, let's just call that magic. Mike told you. He did, and he also told me you like the matzo ball from Katz's, so I switched it out. It's pretty good, huh? This is the plan for the deception. Budget's on the back, but don't worry... We already paid using the extra Felix Ruiz money. I'm sorry I screwed up, Kay. You were right. I took the case personally. And I just don't want Noah to die from my screw-up. Man: Agent Daniels? It's Mikhail. I'm sorry, Cameron. We've got to move before we lose him.

[ Paddles whine ] Clear! Woman #2: Clear! [ Thump ] [ Mikhail whimpers ] 175 joules now. - Set! - Clear! [ Thump ] [ Flat line ] Give me 200 joules now. - 200! Set! - Clear!

Want to have this crap on your face? You should keep it. It's a good look for you. ♪♪ Cameron: All right. All right. It's going great. Uh, tighten the straps on the gurney a tick more so it's hard to breathe. [ Mikhail grunting ] Raise the heat lamp and cue Dina. [ Radio beeps ] Okay, Dina. [ Monitor beeping ] - Dina: That does not look good. - Jordan: Here. Look at me, sir. No, no, no, don't look that way. Oh, and it's spreading. [ Mikhail screaming ] - What are you doing to him? - Nothing. Technically. We, uh, tighten the straps through the control panel. [ Mikhail grunts ] Got heat lamps in the light. Dina: He's burning up. And Jordan put these little speakers in the headrest. [ High-pitched ringing ] I hear ringing. Mostly, it's theatrics. - [ Gasps ] - Sir. Sir? You've been exposed to an unknown toxin. Without treatment, you could die. Anything that you know, you've got to tell me. Your life depends on it, okay? I... I know an antidote. She's very good. Dina? Dina's the best. Dina, go for the antidote. Gunter, loosen the straps. Let him talk. [ Whirring ] [ Groans ] There's... There's two poisons. This... [ Whispers indistinctly ] ♪♪ ♪♪ Hi. It's Cameron Black. Yeah, the poison's a combo. It's a nerve agent and a neurotoxin. You're gonna need to use... [ Noah breathing shallowly ] Get me atropine and trivalent. Prep for synchronous injections. [ Monitor beeping ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Chuckles ] We did it. [ Chuckles ] Where's Mikhail? ♪♪ [ Door bursts open ] Dina: Cameron! We have a problem, darling. [ Grunts ] - What'd you do to me?! - Nothing. Nothing. - You're fine. - What the hell is going on?! - Let her go, Mikhail. - Did you poison me? You can't do that. You're the FBI. You were never sick. There is no hospital. It's all fake. That's impossible. I saw it. Uh, no, it's... it's called a forced perspective. You see, you were on a gurney, so all we needed was the ceiling and the hallway, and the lights in the E.R. were blinding enough that you... you couldn't make out the walls. So, uh, you kind of saw whatever we wanted you to see. Oh, yeah? See this? - Nice catch. - Thanks. This is never gonna hold up in court. Doesn't have to. Tell me where he is. [ Scoffs ] [ Handcuffs click ] Never. Joseph and Bridget were fools to think they could leave. They belonged to Sasha. Even their kid. We all do. So you can arrest me. You can throw me in jail. I'm not gonna say nothing. Mikhail, I have bad news for you. I'm not gonna arrest you. I'm letting you go. I'm betting Sasha's men find you pretty fast. If you're lucky, they'll kill you quickly. If not... Tell me. Where's Sasha now? ♪♪ [ Police radio chatter ] Did you forget something? Yeah. You. Yeah. Smart cover. In public, you're the bartender where all the mobsters drink. But in reality... You're Sasha. And you're under arrest. ♪♪ Dina: I am 1,000% sure that that was a set-dec problem and not a talent issue. - Oh, boy. - Hold on a minute. Are you blaming me? That set was magnificent. I could've flipped it over and sailed the Channel. - [ Laughs ] - Like back in the war? I wasn't in the navy, and you know that. You know, actually, we know very little. Yeah, and that's the way I'm gonna keep it. I'm mysterious. That's my advantage. [ Cellphone chimes ] [ Laughter ] Hey, any word on Noah? He's good. He's resting. Doctors say he's gonna pull through. And I talked to the prosecutor. Mikhail's confession will get him off the hook for murder. Oh, and what about Sasha, the man behind the man? Well, he's currently a guest of the federal government and hopefully for a long time. Oh, cheers to that. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers to that! - Yes! Cheers! [ Glasses clinking ] [ Indistinct conversations ] You know, this is what it used to be like, with Johnny. Dina: He does it all the time. It's, like, a... Thanks for giving me another chance. It was worth the risk. The FBI wants to make it official... Deception Team is a go. Wow. You know, they didn't even hear my whole pitch. I mentioned Sasha's arrest. And we got Felix. Johnny thinks I'm naive. And I gotta say I'm having a hard time disagreeing with him. I mean, why would the FBI make my brother a priority? They're not gonna take it emotionally like I do. They can't. I can. You asked about the first body I saw, the overdose victim. Right. You said it wasn't a case. You weren't FBI. She was my sister. She had gotten addicted to cocaine and then other things. When I found her, she'd only been dead a few hours. She was still beautiful.
