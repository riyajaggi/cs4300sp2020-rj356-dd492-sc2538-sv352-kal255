 While nobody knew I had a twin brother behind the scenes. Until the night he was framed for murder. The woman in the car with me had different color eyes. Now I've teamed up with the FBI. You're Cameron Black. That's Agent Kay Daniels... - I know a few tricks, too. - And we have a deal. She helps me prove my brother's innocent. I help her solve the kind of crimes only a master of deception could crack. I feel like we should be chasing somebody.

 Thankfully, I don't work alone. For my team of illusionists, there's no criminal we can't trick, no killer we can't track. Like I always say, nothing's impossible. Previously on "Deception"... You're amazing. I'm... I'm worried about you. I'm just alone in here. There are a dozen of these. If each is another road map, another plan... That's a lot of unfinished business. And these are more than just works of art. These are coded messages.

 I know who's behind it. This is about something far greater. Everyone wants to learn a magic trick, but mastering even the most basic illusion can take months, years, a lifetime. Constant practice. You might call it an obsession. But if you're not careful, an obsession can take over your life. You won't even know what you're losing until it's gone. Did you know that high heels were originally made for guys? Not any of the guys that I grew up with. In the 1500s, soldiers wore them to help stand in a horse's stirrups and shoot bow and arrows. And they've been completely useless ever since. I wanted to make sure you were going to bed. I wish. Just a quick change. I have that appearance at One-Oak. No, let's cancel. Adi, I can't cancel. Yeah, you can't, but I can. It's fine. Stop. Why are you being so weird? Michael Kors is gonna be at the club tonight. After what he said about you in Vienna, I just... Give us a sec? Can you run and grab my white jacket? It's on the chair. Who's here? Whoever's here, you're gonna wish you weren't. Hey. So, what do you think? Pretty amazing, right? FBI got Corrections to sign off. This is now your own private workspace. What exactly am I working on? We found Bishop's notebook. It's filled with new cryptograms. Now, we think the mystery woman's next move is gonna be in there somewhere, but it's written in a code that the FBI's best cryptographers can't crack. Now, it's just a hunch, John, but we figure out what's in there, we're one step closer to getting you out of here. Jordan, you've got to make this work. Okay, damn it, Dina. I know! Okay, don't snap at me. I-I'm working as fast as I can. I'm just saying... Ay, yi, yi, yi. What's the crisis. This is serious. It's Lexi. Yeah, I know. I saw. It's not ideal Cam's ex-girlfriend being plastered all over a billboard outside his room, but what are we gonna do? Paint a big mustache all over her face? She was more than just an ex. And it's not just a billboard. Attempted robbery, and with her fame, it's trending... wide. If Cameron finds out about this, he'll use it as an excuse to see Lexi. He's a glutton for punishment. And the last time Lexi popped up, he grew a soul patch and started getting into Bon Iver. I've scrubbed her name from all of his news feeds and social networks. Nice, but he can still pick up a newspaper. Morning, guys. Hey. Just came from prison, so sorry I'm late. Cam! Scramble you some eggs? Yeah, I'm starving. Johnny and I have been working on the, Bishop's notebooks, you know, trying to figure that stuff out. Did I, - Did I have a newspaper when I walked in? Did you No. I don't think so. It's Kay! - Hello, Kay. - Morning. Our linguistics department ran a scan of Bishop's journal. Might be something helpful in there for Jonathan. Crack you an egg, Kay? No, I've got to run. FBI Special Events Squad helps oversee security for Fashion Week and so I've... - No! - Wait, wait! Got to interview Lexi Simone about this break-in. Lexi? You're... You're interviewing Lexi. You know her? Yeah, we, we dated a few years back. Didn't work out. I mean, technically, she broke up with me, but she had some, trust issues. "Trust issues." You know what? Not a Deception Group case. No, it's cool. I'll, - I'll tag along. I have a great relationship with all my exes. I can probably be of some help. Thanks, guys. See ya! Adi√≥s. Miss Simone, thank you for coming in to talk to us. What are you doing here? Hello, Vince. Lexi. I work with the FBI now, using my skills of intuition, mastery of deception. Some card stuff. Ever since everything that happened with Jon... Do I... Who's Jonathan? Wait, do you not know? Please don't ask that. The secret twin brother you never told me about? The one I learned about on the news along with the rest of the world? That Jonathan? Yeah, I should've told you about him, but, um, to be fair, you were always accusing me of seeing someone else. I told you there was no other woman. There was another brother. Cameron, you still lied to me. I'm sorry. She thought you were cheating on her, but in reality, you were hiding your twin brother? Yeah, thank you. See, it doesn't sound that bad when you say it out loud. Yeah, it does. All right, well... can we get back to work, maybe? Kay, do you want to... Lexi? My God. My God. She's dating Rafe Willems? Yeah. Why. You're impressed by that? You okay? Yes. I'm okay. Are you sure? Of course. He's like the prince of Silicon Valley. His company is changing the world. Yeah, yeah. Are you all right? You sure? I'm fine. I'm not even sure there was someone in the room, honestly. I-I know I got knocked out, but all I could see was, like, a shadow. And do you always do a sweep of the room before Lexi goes to bed? No, I was just grabbing something. Adi wanted Lexi to get some rest, but we were heading back out. Thanks for talking to us. NYPD will be wrapping up this investigation. Wrapping up? This feels like a botched robbery, not an FBI case. We don't have a suspect, a motive, or an eyewitness. We have a magic flying lamp and a shadow. Those are things. Cam... I know you've got this unresolved stuff with Lexi, but... Whoa, this isn't about me. We're the FBI, Agent Daniels. We have a job to do, all right? And a lot of things about this are not adding up for me. I still have some questions. Thank you. So, Vince. What do we think about this Rafe guy? Okay! We're done here. Thank you. What 'Cause it's never the boyfriend? Mr. Black, I find it hard to believe that this is the best use of our resources. "Mr. Black"? Come on, you've been calling me "Cameron" for weeks. This is video surveillance footage of Lexi's hotel. I'm just trying to be thorough. We're almost done. I'm handing this over to the NYPD. What? No. Look, I get it. I just... Want to be Lexi's hero? No. Things are different now, and I don't have anything to hide, and I just want her to know that I can... Well, I'm not a bad guy. I can help. There's nothing left to do. No matter how hard you try. And what is he doing here? Deakins is getting pissed. Jordan? He's working. He's doing, like, computer stuff. Jordan, find anything? Nope. I've gone through all of Lexi's social media, and there's a ton... She's always on. She's Instagramming live from a photo shoot. Social media? How come I never see her on... Dina and I blocked her from your phone and computer. Wha... Yeah, that's fair. I did find one odd deviation. Last night, Lexi told the cops she was on her way to One-Oak, but this was the last tweet she sent. "Off to sleep." She didn't technically post it. That's the weird part. It was sent from her publicist Adi's phone. Well, is that unusual? Wouldn't a publicist have access? Adi's tweeted as Lexi before, but always promotional stuff, branding content. That's why this stuck out. And Vince told us that Adi was pressuring Lexi to stay in. Adi could be the inside man. Right? Delivering Lexi to the shadow. This is a lead. We should talk to Lexi. Lexi? Don't you mean Adi, the inside man? Right, that's... That's what I meant. I mean, they're probably together, so... Don't! Where's the photo shoot? The Palace Theater. Thank you. Right there. Good, good. Great. Go up one more. Next stop. Good. Well, that's exactly my point. That's great. Next stop. Good. - She's up there. - Good one. Adi, we need to talk. What. What... That doesn't feel right. Lexi! Cameron! Wait a minute. Where's Lexi? What the hell just happened? Lexi disappeared. There must be some kind of trap door in this platform. How else did they disappear like that? I checked the building records. The ground is solid. There's no way they took her out that way. Counter Terrorism is checking the subway line under the building, but it's a long shot. What do you think happened? Because it looked like she... She just disappeared into thin air? If you wanted to do this in your act, how would you? Black Art? Makes sense. What's Black Art? Would you? Black Art is one of the oldest forms of stage magic. Essentially it exploits the fact that you can't see black against black. So for example... Gunter had just painted the backside of that black. Exactly. This could be why they killed the lights... To cover her in a black screen and take her out the stage door. Cameron! Also makes sense for what Vince said... How he only saw a shadow. Yeah, except for the fact that I was watching. And if that was Black Art, that is the best I've ever seen. Honest! I got an e-mail a few days ago from the office of a major publicist. And they offered you $50,000 to sabotage Lexi's appearance? This kind of thing happens all the time in my business. They were opening another club. They just... They didn't want the competition. It's harmless. It's kidnapping. I swear I had nothing to do with what happened. I love Lexi. Okay. I don't know about her. Adi's story checks out. That woman is a genius at PR. I'm not surprised she can spin a story in her favor. Well, the e-mail she got was sent from a bogus account, but on Adi's phone, it looked legit. It's untraceable, and the funds were wired to her yesterday. Maybe. Keep her feet to the fire and see if her story stays the same. This case still isn't making sense. No word from the kidnappers or a ransom demand. What's this? It's a diorama for the Palace Theater. Gunter and Jordan made it to see what we'd need to make Lexi disappear. Dina also found something very cool. This is an inventor by the name of Walt Whipply. Now, he created a paint that is literally the blackest substance in the world. That's the exactly the kind of thing that I would need to make Lexi here disappear. You and Mike should go talk to. Yeah. It's all right. I already got my guys on it. They're running it down. Your guys? There it is. A brilliant inventor lives here? Come on, son. Don't judge a book by its cover. Be cool. He did sound a bit dodgy on the phone, though. Walt, it's me. Gunter? How you doing? Thanks for coming. Excited you're here. Is this guy a cop? Who, him? No, he's with the FBI. No, you go first. Hello? Hey, Dina. What's up? I need a book, from the archive to help break Bishop's code. It's a leather-bound thing, big metal faceplate. Sure. I'll grab it, and, um, I'll give it to Cam and he can get it to you A.S.A.P. Yeah. If... If you got time? I... It'd be good to see you again. Thanks for meeting with us, Dr. Whipply. Just Walt. Dr. Whipply was my dog's name. So, you're interested in my work? Yeah, yeah. Your, um, special paint. It's fascinating stuff. You're familiar with carbon tube nano rays? Sure. Allotropes of carbon with a cylindrical nanostructure. Very good. Here. Look. This is a normal ball, but the back half has been coated. Light is hitting the ball, but it's not bouncing back to your eyes. 'Cause it's trapped in a nano-tube forest. Amazing. Has anybody tried to buy some paint off you recently? I created it, but I don't have the patent. Research and development, it bankrupted me. So I took on a partner. Angel investor. Once I was finished, he became a lot less angelic. But that's business. I might still have a billion-dollar idea in me. Like my autonomous car. The funny thing is, the company that has the patent for my paint hasn't licensed it to anyone. Far as I can tell, it's sitting on a shelf somewhere at I.R. Tech. Isn't that Rafe Willems' company? So, according to Jordan, I.R. Tech has the exclusive rights to Walt's paint. Did I not say that Rafe was behind this? It's interesting. I agree. It's Rafe, Kay! It's Rafe. 100%. I still don't see a motive. With his wealth and influence, it's more likely he's the target somehow. You know who does have a motive? Walt. Rafe stole his tech, so he steals Rafe's girlfriend. Either for money or revenge. Shall we? Yeah. I still pinch myself that I get to work here. I actually wrote my dissertation on Rafe's early work on planetary colonization. The I.R. Bracelet, Rafe's newest masterpiece. It uses a diamagnetic levitation system to summon objects right to your hand. We're still in beta. The team has never worked so hard. That's Izzy Fortnette. I.R. Tech's Chief Design Officer, right? He's much more than that. Whatever Rafe imagines, Izzy designs. Are you looking for your boyfriend's book, love? I'm trying to help Jonathan for the same reasons we all are. He's family. There's nothing going on between us anymore. Good. I was just worried that you were leading on my friend, Special Agent Mike Alvarez. Gunter! There is nothing going on between me and Mike. Is it really that obvious? Really I'm just a good detective. I've seen the looks between you. Why haven't you told him about your past with Jonathan? Because it's embarrassing and painful. And it's over. Really? Are you sure? They're never gonna let me take this into a jail, are they? I don't know, but I do have a friend in the FBI who would love to help you out with this. Fine, yes. Yes. Shady. That was the governor. Donated a few million. You'd think he'd be able to get us a lead. We have a lead. We know what tech was used to take Lexi. You do? Yeah, yeah, and you are the sole owner. What are you talking about? Walt Whipply's paint. That paint was stolen. I-I was gonna use it to coat our microprocessors, and I-it turned up missing a few months ago when we ran inventory. That's convenient. It's the truth. Lexi's missing. You're afraid. I understand that. But you're also nervous. Why are you nervous? What aren't you telling us? Do you know where Lexi is? All right! The kidnappers contacted me a few hours ago. They sent this. Rafe? I'm safe and haven't been hurt... yet. Bring a working prototype of the I.R. Bracelet to 125th and Broadway tonight, and they'll let me go. Don't tell the police. Don't be a hero. Rafe, please lis... The file is encrypted, but it proves she's still alive and what they're really after. Your I.R. Bracelet? A flying key chain? It's much more than that. It's a whole new tech sector worth billions. They want a working prototype. I can't give them one. Why 'Cause your empire is more important than saving Lexi? Her life is on the line. I know. I... I would do anything to save Lexi. I can't give to them because the tech's never actually worked. But we saw the video. It's some special effects. They... They want me to give them something that does not exist. What if we made it work? What do you mean? We give them a working prototype, they give us Lexi, right? Yes. How? Magic. This case is finally starting to make sense. Five hours to deliver a working I.R. Bracelet in exchange for Lexi. I just hate the way he walks. That gait. I mean, I just don't trust him. Unfortunately, your only chance of getting Lexi back is if you get his tech to work. Man, that walk is super annoying. Get to work on the deception. I'll get the prototype. After 17 years of carrying you, I thought that maybe you were about to do your job. But no, you just decided to embarrass me yet again. Congrats. Here's the I.R. Bracelet. It's a prototype. Rafe. I'm so sorry. Japan needs an answer. Excuse me. Hey, can I ask you a few questions? Sure. Um... Yeah, but, um, n-not... Not here. Thank you so much for driving, but you really don't have to come in. It's nothing. Besides, I've never met Jonathan. Right. Sure. But... But you don't have to come all the way in. It's fine. Please, I would love to meet him. Okay. So, I did not know you were such a good singer. What are you talking about? Mike. Did you Google me? I did. That was 15 years ago. I can tell. The hair. Listen, we do not have to talk about that ever again. Do you understand? Scout's honor. Ms. Clark, what's the relationship between you and the prisoner? Um, just friends. Um, just work and stuff. Not like... you know... Just friends. Just friends. Yeah. Yeah, friends. Rafe's brilliant, but he's demanding. He created this reality distortion field. In his world, anything is possible, and if we can't figure it out, that's our fault. That's our shortcoming. Well, that's got to be hard. Yeah. It's brutal. There's this new creation of his, this I.R. Bracelet. I mean, I've been telling him for years that it's not possible, but he doesn't listen. He never... Rafe distorts the world to fit into his version of reality. And he always gets what he wants. Until now. Hey. Hey. I love what you've done with the place. That's funny. Mike Alvarez. FBI. Jonathan Black. Prisoner. Right, so, um, catch us up. Have you figured out the Mystery Woman's next move? I got nothing. Bishop's code is impenetrable. Made some progress with The Vigener Square but then a keyword changed... Any chance the Playfair System would work? A literal diagram substitution? Mike's really good at codes and... stuff like that. Is he? Yeah, a block cypher's not a bad idea. Which is why I already tried it. Got nowhere. But... then it dawned on me, the law of the cryptography being used is similar to stuff being used in Houdini's journal. Which is why I needed that. A book on Houdini's Journal? No. This is Houdini's Journal. Our grandfather built it. What?! You and Cameron have a flair for the dramatic. I love it! This is a Rotor Cypher our grandfather built. Could help unlock Bishop's code. That's amazing. Right, well, I think we should go now. I think we, um, got a lot on. So, but good luck with that and... come on! Let's just get out of here. Okay, guys, we've got to make these keys float to the bracelet. I'm thinking Blackstone's Handkerchief. One pound test line should do it. It works. Thought Rafe was supposed to be the new Steve Jobs. Not some fraud. He may be a fraud. He may be a genius. I don't really care. All that matters is getting this stuff to work so I can get Lexi back. Yeah? By which I mean get her back safe. That's cute. She just... get your minds out of the gutter. Bring a working prototype of the I.R. Bracelet to 125th and Broadway tonight. Don't worry. It'll work. We're the best at this. Whatever "this" is. I know. I've flown to Vegas to see your shows. I always wanted to do magic. But I was never any good at it. So, I tried to make magic real instead. Made this. I used to think this tech was what I needed to dedicate my life to, but it's just a toy. My relationship with Lexi is the most important thing I'll ever create. I need to get her back. We will. Black. Phone. What's going on, Cam? Do you think I have intimacy issues? What? Aren't you meeting the kidnappers, like, any minute? I thought this was an emergency. It is. I just realized that I never actually felt love from Dad. You know, whatever I thought was love was really just his approval. Are you kidding me? I'm in here fighting for my life and you're asking for Freudian analysis? So, you do think I have issues. Why didn't I tell Lexi about you, man? We hid so much of ourselves. We had a show to perform. Yeah, and I just knew it was the most important thing in my life. But what if it wasn't? What if I let the most important thing just walk away? Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Saw Dina today. Mike seems like a nice guy. Yeah. Yeah, he really is. Dad totally messed us up? Yeah. Big time. Eyes up. Remember, a woman's life is on the line here. Everyone is in place. Where is she? We're where the kidnappers said to meet. We have the I.R. Bracelet. I'm fully in character. Everything's going according to plan. That's not the plan. I've seen this car before. At Whipply's lab. Hello. Get in. Where is Lexi? Get in or the girl dies. There's no one driving that car. Driverless car technology is not magic, Cam. Let's hope not. They're on the move. Don't lose them. Go. Friends of yours? Six men. Five armed. I count two G3 Long Barrel rifles, three MPKs. These guys are totally legit. Maybe spec warfare? Those are military-grade weapons. Have the tactical team stand by. The magic team is ready, ma'am. Nice place you've got here. It's lovely. Proceed. Copy that. Going in. We're here to see your demonstration, Mr. Willems. Fine. Just give us a second to set up. I can't do this. Look at these guys. What are you talking about? You're being dramatic. I've played for way tougher crowds than this. Plus, you said you'd do anything for Lexi, right? This is what that looks like. Hey, Jordan. Random question.- Was there ever anything between Dina and Jonathan? Yeah. True love. They're the real thing. Gave me hope I'd find a partner I love that much. Yeah. Okay, thanks. There's something else. No, really, I got it. No, that transponder. That's a radio transponder. I don't think this car is fully autonomous. They're being controlled by someone in the area. Let's move. Was that an all-of-us "let's move"? Okay, let's go. What if everything in your world could be summoned on your command? If everything was in your control? Lost your keys? Just call for them. Keys! Alright, I think it's right there. We have developed a diamagnetic levitation system that allows us to counteract the effects of gravitational acceleration. Tough crowd. Our competitors thought it couldn't be done. They thought it was impossible. It's not. It's the future. It's your future. Amazing. We have a deal. The funds are ready to transfer. Passcode... 4952841. Okay, where's Lexi? Who's Lexi? I was invited to buy your product. No, that's not the deal! Where is Lexi? We're leaving. What the hell. What the hell?! Hello? I'm impressed. I gave you everything you asked for! You sold a worthless magic trick for $200 million, Rafe. That's not what I wanted. I know that voice. It's not Walt's. Your tricks were impressive, Mr. Black. But you failed, Rafe. Open the car. Open the car now. The girl dies, Rafe. That was always my plan. She dies. Don't move. Too late. Hey, Cameron. It's Izzy. He kidnapped Lexi. This is about revenge. No, it's about karma. He deserves this. Dina, I'm tapping you into Izzy's feed. Cameron, watch out. It looks like he programmed the car to do something. Cam, move! What the hell is going on? It appears that Cameron is riding on the hood of a driverless car. Go on, Cam! Hey, I'm sorry I lied. About Jonathan. I'm a liar. I'm sorry. Forget it, forget it. I'm saving you. Izzy, stop the car now! Impossible. I locked us out. Stop the damn car! Cam, it's up to you. We're good. Okay, Cam, we can't stop the car from here. You need to disable it from inside. There's a control cluster on the roof. A white box. There's a switch in here. Throw it! Alright. I'm in. You alright? Cameron, it was Izzy. We know. I'm sorry I lied about Jonathan. I promise... no more lies. Thanks. Do you have any idea what you're doing? Yeah, absolutely. Sorry, no, but I have a whole team of people working on this. Guys, what do I do now? I can't control anything in here. Go out the sunroof. Use the airbag as a parachute. No, that's insane. Cam, you can override Izzy's algorithm, but you need to get under the dash. Alright, I'm in. Now what? Okay, um... Jordan, they're running out of road. Look for the back panel connectors. There should be, like, four ports with plug-ins. Okay, got 'em. Okay, pull one of them out. Care to be more specific? Pull one of them out... please? Cameron, pull them all. Cameron, the truck! Go, we got to go. Climb out. What about you? I don't care about me, I care about you. Go! Come on, there's no time. Go! Go! Move! Go! My God. You're gonna learn to like me. You did it. I did? Thank you, Cameron. You saved me. Wow. Cameron, Rafe did it. He saved you. I-I-It was nothing, really. I-I just overrode Izzy's lockout and reprogrammed the drive parameters. Not your best work, Iz. Go to hell, Rafe. Did you hear that? Yeah, yeah. The... jumping on the moving car, riding on the hood and sun roof, that was... What is it? It was Rafe. Rafe saved you. Us. He reprogrammed the car, and that was what... It was him. Your... Your boyfriend. Cameron, it's Rafe. Please, can you just tell Lexi how much I love her. Sure, man. Rafe wants you to know that he loves you. I love him, too. Yeah. You got that? She... She loves you, too. Thank you, Cameron. Anytime. Izzy was a multi-billionaire. Why do this? Rafe was a relentless boss. He demanded the impossible. Izzy wanted to punish him by creating his own impossible task. He knew their tech didn't work. That was the point. And Izzy was using Whipply's tech the whole time to frame him. Smart. And also very stupid. I heard you had quite an interesting talk with Jordan. To say the least. Why didn't you tell me the truth? Because I didn't want to screw up what's happening now. I didn't want to... screw up what's happening between us. What's happening now? So, when you finally get this I.R. Bracelet thing working... It's never gonna work. It's... It's... It's too ambitious. It's... too impossible. You know, I had a mantra in my show, "Nothing's impossible". We proved it every single show. That's... "Nothing's impossible"? That's good. That... That's a campaign slogan. That's "Think Different". Well, yeah, yeah, but it's mine. I wasn't... can't just... Yeah, no, yeah... Take it... I gotta... Sorry. Hi. Yeah, no, it's... just as long as you just don't... Wait, listen. I just got this great idea, yeah. Upon further review, I did save Rafe's life earlier. So, when he saved your life, it was kind of like me saving you. Just want to make sure I made up for past mistakes. Maybe. It's partly my fault, too. Dating a magician, I should've known. You always had something hidden up your sleeve. I have a new trick. And, um, I think you're gonna love this one. I disappear at the end. Goodbye, Cameron. Hey, man. Time for another therapy session? I got a lot to analyze. Cam, I broke the Mystery Woman's code. That's great, Johnny. Can we talk about it later? I'm kind of... kind of tired. Figured out what the next target is. Cam, you listening? Cam, the target... It's you! Johnny, there's something wrong. There's all these people. They're filming me. Cam, you have to run. Cameron! Cameron! Cameron!! Greg, move your head.
