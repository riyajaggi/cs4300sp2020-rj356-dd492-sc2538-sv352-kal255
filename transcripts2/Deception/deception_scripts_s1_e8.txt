 - Previously on "Deception"... - Why would you steal a stained-glass window and some old watch? I'm not. We're returning them. MAN: We are building something new. - What is that? - "Quest Trek." - "Quest Trek" the game? - Yeah. It's like "Pokémon Go" except way cooler. Can you tell us about the Octagon? What is it?

 Figured out who the next target is... it's you! Cam, you have to run. - Hello, Cameron. - Aah! ♪♪ You can't make him do this. Cameron's not ready. SEBASTIAN: He has to be, so he will be. Don't worry, Johnny. I've got it. I can do the third act escape. Cameron is the better performer. He has to learn on his own. Go. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪

 ♪♪ [Handcuffs rattle] ♪♪ ♪♪ Oh, you're awake? Good. You know, the pool is lovely. You should take a dip. Where am I? Why did you frame my brother for murder? And where are my pants? One, Madrid. Two... well, that's complicated. And three, who cares? You gonna let me out of these things? And what exactly will you do if I unlock you? Run away? Hurt me? Something else? Being this is the first time I've been handcuffed to a bed by a beautiful woman in a foreign country, you're greatly mistaken. What is this, really? A test. I'm deciding if you're ready to come work for me. To work for you? You've been helping the FBI solve crimes. I want you to... help me commit one. [Chuckles] Okay. Sure. Uh, the answer's "No." That's a hard no. Here's the question, Cameron. My test for you... ♪♪ What are you willing to do to save your brother? ♪♪ You think on that while I take a shower. ♪♪ Anything. You sure about that? ♪♪ ♪♪ [Grunts] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Both grunting] ♪♪ ♪♪ Come on. Come on. [Elevator bell dings] ♪♪ ♪♪ 63 seconds. That's impressive. Your hair is dry. Think it through. Take it apart. It was somebody else in the shower... translight of Madrid, you put the pen on the pad knowing what I would do, the gun is a prop, and the elevator only opened when you were ready. Almost perfect. Why? I told you. A test. An audition. Why didn't you shoot me when you took the gun? 'Cause I'm not a psychopath. You didn't think about the question. What are you willing to do to save your brother? I told you. Anything. It's not a prop. What? The gun. It's real. There's one in the chamber, ready to go. Pull the trigger. But it was a test. Too late. [Groans] Remember this. My tests are real. Night-night. Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com [Techno music plays] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Muffled techno music plays] Jordan. Jordan. Jordan. [Music stops] Trying to work here, guys. What is it? Cameron's disappeared. It's her. The Mystery Woman. She's got him. Well, that's what Jonathan thinks. They were on the phone together when it happened. - She's gonna kill him. - No. What then? She's gonna book him for a birthday party? If she wanted to kill him, she would have done it. She took him. That means she needs him. - When did it happen? - Like two hours ago. Two hours? Okay. We have to find him fast. ♪♪ [Breathing heavily] ♪♪ [Clicking] ♪♪ No! Come on. Dad, I can't do it! [Banging] Help me! [Groans] Oh, good. - Bishop? - You're up. She's been waiting. You know her. Come on. No resting on the job. There's work to be done. What work? What exactly are you doing? A heist, of course. And you are the star. The hell I am. [Chuckles] Now, that is exactly what I said when she came to me. Now, I know, it doesn't look like much. But I assure you, the security here is state of the art. We are completely isolated, we are off the grid, surrounded by nothing. We're in New Jersey. Exactly. Ah, the team. Meet Mr. Dekker. He's our weapons expert. An explosives visionary. He created the black-trigger bomb for Felix's disappearing plane. That was a work of art. Hey. Nice to put a face to the carnage. Kindly meet Tallis, our computer expert and make-up genius. ♪♪ What's in there? Time for your next test. ♪♪ What is this? A mock-up of the main room at Devlin's Auction House. We're going to steal a jewel from the Rockefeller Collection when it goes up for sale tomorrow. We don't know which one yet, just its approximate size. [Scoffs] Did you say "Devlin's Auction House"? I know. Their security's state of the art. The vault impenetrable. That's why we're going to steal it during the auction itself. In front of everyone? Well, there'll be a five-second window to swap the jewel for a copy. Five seconds? In front of what, a hundred people on all sides? Security cameras? Armed guards? Just like one of your specials. [Scoffs] Okay. Also [Sighs] the pedestal's equipped with a hair-trigger motion sensor. [Blows] [Alarm blares] [Scoffs] [Blaring stops] This is your test. Are you good enough? You mean, am I fast enough? Speed is a big part of magic. Sleight of hand, prestidigitation just means "fast fingers." And when a magician says, "Hey, presto," that's just him telling you how the trick was done... with speed. Now, for thousands of years, the human eye was the fastest sensor that we had. But not anymore. This sensor, the security cameras, all these eyes... Your plan is impossible. Sorry. Not as sorry as I am. ♪♪ [Crunching] [Chuckles] How does he do it? 'Course, impossible's kind of my thing. Oh, so you can do it? Sure. But I won't. Your life is on the line. Hm. Okay. I don't know how things work in your business, but in show business, this is unacceptable. First, you frame my brother for murder and ruin my career. Second, you kidnap me, knock me out, and handcuff me naked to a bed. Now, that last part has happened before, but the part that pisses me off the most is you then make me audition. So let me just give you my final final. Go. To. Hell. I will not help you. [Thunk] Ever. - Cameron? - What? You'll want to see this. This USB contains footage of the night of Jonathan's accident. NYPD said the traffic footage was lost. It should be. I took it. Didn't want them to see this part. ♪♪ [Exhales sharply] Girl was dead before the accident. You killed her. I simply chose an appropriate body. The video on this drive will exonerate him. Help me and it's yours. So, one more time. What are you willing to do for your brother? ♪♪ ♪♪ [Alarm blares] So, what happened? You did it before. Yeah, before... I taped down the button. Duct tape can do anything. So, that was a trick? Yeah. They're all tricks. You didn't think I had real magic powers, did you? Back to work. [Door creaks open] ♪♪ I will. Just have to, uh, take five. ♪♪ Is there a reason you're not practicing? Taping down the button won't work at the auction. I don't get it. You frame my brother for murder, you made a plane disappear. This is about more than just one heist. You got another play here. That does sound like me. Maybe I need that mind of yours. When we first spoke, you said I didn't remember you. What did you mean by that? ♪♪ Give us a minute. ♪♪ Have you ever seen the aurora borealis? What? In the winter. You can see it from Reykjavík. ♪♪ This is some kind of code, riddle? What? Nothing. I got to go. Ohh, where? To find out what we're stealing. No. All right? No, no more cryptic non-answers. If we're going to be... working together, then I need to know what's going on. Hundreds of jewels in the Rockefeller Collection are being auctioned off tomorrow. One is special. Why? Jacob Rockefeller, the tragic, misunderstood, genius son of John D., believed it was a key to something far more important, so much so that he hid its identity in a riddle on the wall of his asylum cell. Now, I've arranged for a legion of puzzle-solvers to comb through the asylum, solve the riddle, and then we know what we're stealing. - Easy, right? - W-W-Wait. So you're saying you just destroyed my brother's life 'cause of something a crazy guy wrote on a wall a hundred years ago? If only it were that simple. Wh... I still have more questions. Time to practice. ♪♪ [Indistinct conversations] Addison, I've been looking for you. This guy is about to make it to the final room. That was fast. Thought you'd want to be there. You're the only one who knows the answer. LANCE: Oh, she's not here. I was just talking to her a moment ago. KAY: Where could she have gone? On the floor, assisting with the quest. Thanks. I'll head over there now. ♪♪ [Alarm blares] - Damn it. - Come on, Cameron. I'm not impressed here. I'll get it. I never let an audience down before. So, where'd she go? I can't tell you that. You know, I get the funny feeling that you don't trust me. What? The first chance you'll get, you're gonna call the FBI. And, you know, we just can't have that, can we? You really believe in her, don't you? Yeah. She's going to tear up everything. The whole rotten system. She's got the world wired. Why would she tear it down? - She believes in a better world. - Really? - Yeah. - [Scoffs] You wanted her to be an anarchist, - so she's an anarchist. - That's enough. She's playing you. ♪♪ Now, remember. You need me to do the swap. Yeah, you're right, so I can't break your fingers, can I? How about your face? ♪♪ [Spray hisses] [Thud] ♪♪ Gotta love duct tape. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Door opens] ♪♪ This is it. This is the real room. This is where the patient lived. ♪♪ God, he hated it here. There's so much anger on these walls. He didn't think he belonged here. No patterns, though. It's just frustration. ♪♪ Wait. ♪♪ There it is. ♪♪ He recreated the nighttime sky. Huh. As a kid, I was kind of obsessed with astronomy. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Switches click] ♪♪ ♪♪ I did not see that coming. ♪♪ ♪♪ "AB." No way. [Phone rings] Hello? CAMERON: Jordan, it's me. Don't tell anyone I'm calling. No! Stop. Don't say a word. Who's on the phone? Um... You can talk now. Just... tell him it's no one. It's no one. All right, now, find somewhere private. No one? [Whispering] Cameron, what the hell's going on? I need you to find something for me. I thought we were finding you. Kay got Jonathan out and everything. Whoa. Johnny's out? Yeah, it's like a "48 Hours" deal, because, you know, everyone thinks the Mystery Woman's torturing you in a dungeon somewhere. No, I'm fine. She wants me to pull a heist. Then let us rescue... wait, wait, is this Stockholm syndrome? No. She's got evidence that proves Johnny's innocent. I help her, she gives it to me. [Sighs] This is insane. We work for the FBI. They fire you for smoking pot. Do you think that the Deception Group survives - if you help a wanted fugitive? - Doesn't matter! The group only exists to help Johnny, anyway. What about Kay? She vouched for you. She'll lose her job. Man, she's super into being an FBI agent. Yeah, well... I don't... I don't know. All right? I just... Please, I'm so close to helping Johnny. Okay. What do you need? All right, there's an old photo upstairs. I need you to find it for me. Send it to this number. [Sighs] Definitely Stockholm syndrome. Hey. Whatcha doing? Running down leads at Quest Trek. - What are you doing? - Worrying, mostly. You don't have to be so defensive. Is Dina okay? She's freaking out, man. I know. I'm sorry. This will be over soon. Why did you call me? Why not Dina or Gunter? You're the best liar. Thanks, boss. JONATHAN: Why the extra stars? They, uh... they make a larger constellation. Shaped like a "W." The Lynx. That's the answer, isn't it? Lynx. But you didn't know that until just now. ♪♪ Thank you, Jonathan. - [Door unlocks] - No, no! [Door locks] Thank you so much for playing. [Banging on door] ♪♪ [Blows] Okay. Found it. - [Camera shutter clicks] - What am I looking at? Man on the right. Who is he? ♪♪ My great-grandfather. Uh, family photos. Bunch of old flyers advertising the shows. Aw, you were so cute. Or Jonathan was. Still can't tell the difference. If it's cute, it's me. Would you focus, please? Sorry. Who are these guys, anyways? My dad told us it's a photo of our great-grandfather Alistair and some other guys. I never paid that much attention. Hold on. Why does the Mystery Woman have this photo of your great-grandfather? I have no idea. But the violin, the watch, the window... they're all things that Bishop stole for her, so she has gone to great lengths to recreate this exact moment. My guess is whatever she's up to, the answer's in this photo. [Engine revs, tires screech] ♪♪ All right. Look at the other guys in the photo, see what you can figure out. - I got to go. - Wait, wait, Cameron. ♪♪ You all right, bud? [Breathes heavily] What'd you do to me? Me? You knocked yourself out. Y-You trying to escape? Yeah, I guess I wasn't trying that hard, huh? It's all right. You're embarrassed. It's understandable. MYSTERY WOMAN: Bishop! I'm back! [Whispering] If I were you, I'd tell her we were working this whole time. ♪♪ ♪♪ That is great work there, Cameron. You're back. You figure out what we're stealing from the auction? ♪♪ Um, yeah. The Lynx Diamond. Um, Item 71 in the Rockefeller Collection. Dekker is making a copy for the swap right now. How are we getting in? Well, the guest list is locked down. Everyone was vetted months ago. Luckily, there is a man on the list who's right about your height. So kill him, take his fingerprints... Whoa, whoa. We're not killing anybody. What do you want to do, knock him out, hope he doesn't call the police when he wakes up? Well, we're going to get a little fancier than that, but, yeah, we're not killing him. This guy... he is known to the world as an investor, but he is one of the most ruthless drug smugglers in France. All right. Good to know. We're still not killing him. ♪♪ He hunts giraffes. Wait, is that true? If I say "Yes," can he die? No. Kill. Ing. Fine. What's your plan? Well, you got his whole schedule here, right? So, let's take a look. ♪♪ There you go. Mr. Morel has an appointment at... [Indistinct talking] ♪♪ Welcome to the Plaza Spa. I'm sorry. We're closing in a few minutes. We know. We're just here to... ♪♪ Come on! Seriously? You can't just do that! How do you live with so many rules? Basic morality? Yes, a real burden. Did you give her a tip, at least? ♪♪ Good evening. Welcome to the Plaza Spa. We've been expecting you. ♪♪ ♪♪ This is not the same mask as usual, no? Feels... odd. That's very astute. It has some undertones of, uh, pineapple with, uh, some seaweed extract. It's the latest in rejuvenating face masks. ♪♪ ♪♪ That brunette in the lobby, huh? Maybe send her in after you. [Chuckles] Maybe she wants to work for her tip. She's, um, already gone home for the day. Hm, too bad. ♪♪ You can sit up now. [Phone vibrates] Allô? WOMAN: [Speaking French] La police est là. Tu les as laissés entrer? Je n'ai pas pu les arrêter. Il faut que tu disparaisses. J'ai trouvé un hôtel à Newark. Attends là-bas, jusqu'à ce que je t'appelle. Ne quitte pas la chambre. Ne téléphone à personne. I need new clothes. As you wish. ♪♪ ♪♪ Newark? You really do hate him, huh? The motel doesn't even have cable. You see, not killing people can be fun, too. Don't get used to it. ♪♪ The auction house thinks they have an impenetrable security. No system has been built to keep Cameron out. Which is exactly why we'll be with him every step of the way. [Phone vibrates] [Indistinct conversation] Cameron? Find anything on the photo? Yeah. All of those old white guys in the picture with Alistair were billionaires... Clarence Abernathy, Earl Covington, Hugh DuPont, and John Rockefeller. Rockefeller? It all connects. The diamond is just another piece of the puzzle. Only one I can't find... the guy at the desk. - He's a mystery. - All right. I'll check in later. I knew it. ♪♪ All right. Okay. Don't do anything rash. Remember the jewel. - You still need me. - What the hell is going on? Cameron was making a call. The FBI are probably on their way right now. I don't know what he's talking about. He had a phone. Really? Gun. Search him. [Scoffs] Please, allow me. ♪♪ ♪♪ Oh. Tickles! ♪♪ See? No phone. He is a magician. He hid it. Oh, come on. He's lying. He's just been after me ever since I tranq'd him earlier. What? He didn't. He had a phone and he called someone! Enough. Did you call the FBI? Look, I would rat you guys out in a second if it weren't for the fact that you have the one thing that could exonerate Jonathan. Like I said, I will do anything for my brother. Prove it. Kill him. BOTH: What? You can't be serious. I... I did everything that you asked. I killed for you. Don't. You bitch. You said you'd do anything. ♪♪ Pull the trigger. ♪♪ - This is insane. - This is... This is a test, right?! This is a test?! I told him to guard you and he failed me. Can't trust him. He betrayed you, by the way. - Go ahead. - Listen, he will try to kill you again. And if you're dead, who's going to save Jonathan? Killing him is the only way to get what you want. Remember. My tests are always real. [Voice breaking] I can't do it. Get me out. JONATHAN: Dad sealed the top. You have to open it from the inside. It's okay. You can do this. I'm not going anywhere. Why is he doing this? He wants you to be the best. I don't want to be the best. I'm not. I can't. No, you are. You're amazing and you can do this. - [Tapping] - Just listen to the tapping. I'm right here. I will always be here. [Tapping continues] Time to decide, Cameron. What are you willing to do? Yeah, Cameron. ♪♪ ♪♪ I can't. I told you. It was a test. ♪♪ ♪♪ I told you.

CAMERON: Great. Remember, you're doing this to save Jonathan. Really? You're giving me a pep talk. Two hours ago, you murdered a man. I have layers. No, you have a personality disorder. Addison, the nerdy game designer. Mary, the receptionist. Bishop's anarchist. Even M.W., the brilliant illusionist. None of them are real. I'm not even sure there is a real you under all the lies. WOMAN: Oh, my God. Cameron Black. ♪♪ Jonathan and Kay are here. Oh, yeah. Your brother seems to think he needs to save you from me. This coin is my lucky coin. I'll put it in this hand. I can make it disappear. I can also just make it reappear. Do that one more time for me. That's got to be tough. To help your brother, you have to betray your partner. She believed me, trusted me. And he's your brother. BATZ: We're about to start the bidding. ♪♪ I have to do this. That's right. Get the diamond and Johnny gets out of jail. Please everyone, grab your paddles.

Get ready. - Sorry, Kay. - Don't think about her. Focus on your brother. - Get out of my head. - BATZ: 4.7. - $5 million. - [Spectators gasp] $5 million from bidder number 12. She's just a fed. Forget about her. - Do we have 5.1? - It's him. - BATZ: 5.1. - Jonathan's onto me. Then be fast. Here go the lights. In five, four, three, two, one.

Jordan, stop. Jordan, it's me. Cameron. You're the French dude? You're helping her steal the diamond? I couldn't go through with it. - Why? - Because of Kay. Because of what you said earlier. Cool. But wh... what did I say? Never mind. I need to get everyone away from the vault. Okay. Just... Just tell them what's going on. The minute M.W. figures out I'm working against her, she starts killing people. We need to get our team out of here. Got it. Uh, punch me in the face. What? Punch me in the face! [Grunts] Guys, guys? Jordan needs help. He's... He's in trouble. He's... He's on the east side hallway. We're on our way. Jordan! [Groans] Aah, that French guy can punch. Where did he go?! Uh, uh, that way, towards the exit. The diamond's in the vault, but they can't close the door so we're going to guard it. I got five men here. Five? No, no, Mike. No. No, that's wrong. There's only three. There's only three guards in that area. [Grunting] Hey. [Spray hisses] ♪♪ Get the car. ♪♪ You have the diamond. Now give me the video. ♪♪ Deal's a deal.

Uh, Cameron never made it to Reykjavík. He got sick in Glasgow, and I went on without him. What does that mean? ♪♪ Nothing. Don't make sense. Okay.
