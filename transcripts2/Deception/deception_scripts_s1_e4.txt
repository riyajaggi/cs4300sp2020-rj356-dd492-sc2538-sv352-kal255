 Cameron: I'm Cameron Black. I was the world's greatest illusionist, while nobody knew I had a twin brother behind the scenes. Until the night he was framed for murder. Jonathan: The woman in the car with me had different color eyes. Now I've teamed up with the FBI. You're Cameron Black. That's Agent Kay Daniels... I know a few tricks, too. And we have a deal. She helps me prove my brother's innocent.

 I help her solve the kind of crimes only a master of deception could crack. I feel like we should be chasing somebody. Thankfully, I don't work alone. For my team of illusionists, there's no criminal we can't trick, no killer we can't trap. Like I always say, nothing's impossible. ♪ ♪ There have always been fortune tellers. Kings and pharaohs long ago depended on them. I mean, who invades another country without checking the stars? Today, you don't need to be a king to hear your fortune.

 All you need is $50, all major credit cards accepted. But our fortune isn't really about the future. It's about right now. It's been a year since your Henry died. Your chart is in flux, Susan. Your fortune is changing. How so? A wind out of the east. Really? There's a new regular at the restaurant. But, uh... You've mourned long enough. Henry's at peace. Time for you to live. [Chuckles] Thank you. Same time next week? Yes, of course! ♪ ♪ He puts a lot of pressure on you. - My boss? - Mm. He doesn't understand. Quality takes time. [Cellphone vibrates] See, already asking about updates. At this hour? Well, it's morning in Hong Kong. ♪ ♪ Where is she? I don't know who you're talking about. ♪ ♪ Yes, you do. ♪ ♪ My phone is in the drawer. I'll call her. ♪ ♪ [Grunts] Aah! ♪ ♪ Of course, there is one downside to learning your fortune... Not all of us have a future. Cameron: See, look at this... French Intelligence reported a woman matching our Mystery Woman's description at Charles de Gaulle Airport last month. We're getting closer. Wow. So, the FBI is actually doing what they said they would. Told you. Kay's one of the good ones. She... ♪ ♪ What's with the bruise, John? Oh, yeah. I'm in prison. I owed a guy a favor, so I did a thing for him and... bruise. What kind of favor? You needed a way into a gallery, and I got it. ♪ ♪ [Sighs] Johnny, you got to keep your head down in here. That's the number-one rule, no matter what your idiot brother asks you to do. It was a one-time thing. It's over. Don't worry about it. [Cellphone rings] No more favors, John. [Cellphone beeps] Yep. All right. I'm on my way. A fortune teller was murdered in Chinatown last night. Wonder if she saw that coming. Really? Really. ♪ ♪ How do we know it was a professional killer? The victim was killed with a double tap to her back and the bullets came from a Ruger Mark IV. NYPD flagged it for us. Question is, why would a contract killer go after a local fortune teller? Yeah, also, are we going with assassin, hit man, or is it a contract killer? - Why does it matter? - It doesn't. Second question... Why am I here? You're a magician, victim was magic adjacent. I thought you'd see the connection. [Scoffs] Okay, whoa. What do you mean "magic adjacent"? Wasn't the victim a psychic? Yeah, same basic world. Uh... no. Psychics claim to have real powers. Still just hearing "magic." ♪ ♪ You're trolling me, right? Cameron: Kay, there is a centuries-old rivalry between magicians and spiritualists. Okay, Mike, what do you got? The victim's name is Irene Huang. Background check came back clean. Unless you count lying to people for a living. Not a crime. I mean, it is if you charge money to talk to a dead aunt's ghost. - Still no. - Really? Irene was a-an actress turned fortune teller. According to her Yelp reviews, she was amazing. Changed people's lives. But anybody can do a hot reading, right? What's that? You research the subject ahead of time, and then you "wow" them with something you pulled off Facebook. Customers are waiting here, right? So, they're on their phones, they're talking to their friends. Meanwhile, the "psychic" is watching through some hidden camera probably somewhere around... here! All right, well, it's here somewhere. A way to watch them. ♪ ♪ [Ear piece clatters] What about this? Who would Irene be listening to? Thank you. See? A confederate. It's someone helping with the readings. Like I said, this is a deception. Didn't you and Dina use a radio during your performances? Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly my point. If Irene had someone in her ear, that means they were watching. Maybe they witnessed the murder. Yeah, but how? Where's the camera? Okay, so I lie to people, but Johnny and I told our audience we were magicians, so... well, I guess technically, told them we were amagician. But still, the fact is, we're honest liars. We told them it was a trick. Cameron, we've transitioned back to the case. - Try to keep up. - All right. Well, say whatever you want about me, but the fact is, nobody ever makes a major life decision because of my show. Thank God for that. I don't know, Cameron. You're sounding a little judgy. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [Door opens, closes] Cameron? They didn't use cameras. They used mirrors and... a hidden room. Good news... there was a witness. Bad news... they're gone. All right, check it out. These levers, they adjust the mirrors outside to point directly towards this false wall and this peep hole, which allowed her to see the clients' every move. It's eyeliner. You know what they say. Behind every great woman is another great woman. Irene was an actor. Whoever was back here was a real talent. I mean, look around. No computer. No way to check Facebook, public records. She was cold reading. She was just studying reactions, body language, vocal ticks. All in the moment. ♪ ♪ She had to watch while her partner was killed. ♪ ♪ She left everything... wallet, MetroCard. Looks like she wrote some letters, too. Vivian Song. [Knock on door] Unis have another fortune teller who might know something. Irene was the face of the shop. Vivian did the readings. Only a few of us knew she existed. Kay: Why? What was she hiding from? I don't know. I read her chart once. I've never seen such darkness. Bad luck. Death haunts her. Can you tell us what these say? Vivian left them. They're all names. Uh, that one's mine. Yeah. ♪ ♪ It's their clients list. This is an incredibly valuable gift. She knew she wasn't coming back. Can you think of any place she'd go, somewhere she'd feel safe? No. What is it? It's Agent Daniels. I need a BOLO for one Vivian Song, 26 years old, Chinese national. Possible suicide risk. Man: 2-Adam-1, we have a 1051 jumper on the GW Bridge. Asian female matching FBI BOLO. [Helicopter blades whir] [Breathing shakily] [Sirens wail] ♪ ♪ BOLO came back with a jumper that matched Vivian's description. NYPD has a psychiatrist en route, 10 minutes out. - We don't have that long. - What's your plan? Give her a reason to live. Hope she takes it. Not big into hope. We should have a backup plan. What do you got in mind? I need a tether of some kind. ♪ ♪ - What about a rope? - That'll work. Vivian? My name is Kay Daniels. I'm an FBI agent. Will you talk to me? It won't help. I know about Irene. [Crying] He killed her because of me. It's my fault. There's only one way to stop him. - I need your belt. - What? Come on. What are we doing here? There was this trick Gunter designed for me. It was a flying routine with this amazing apparatus, five operators. But my safety harness broke 15 minutes before curtain. So I came up with this. And it worked, right? No. Fell 30 feet and almost killed myself. Spent a month in hospital. But, you know, it was good practice. All right, hold my legs. Kay: Vivian, talk to me. Tell me why it's your fault. Tell me who "he" is. Look at me. I know you feel like you failed Irene, but this is not the way to stop him. You lost someone, too. Someone you felt responsible for. Someone close. A family member? You sacrificed everything because you want to help. No. You haveto help. Like Irene. Vivian, I can't catch Irene's killer alone. If she helped you... Don't let her die in vain. ♪ ♪ - [Screams] - Vivian! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Hi. I'm Cameron Black. [Applause] == Synced & corrected by MaxPayne == Kay: Who were you hiding from, Vivian? Who's the man who wanted you dead? His name is Miller Mackenzie. He was my client in Hong Kong. Whenever he had a business deal, he'd have me do a reading for him, figure out if it was an auspicious time. What business is he in? International real estate. After a while, he became paranoid, possessive. I saw this getting worse and... I ran. Irene helped you. It was her idea. I could still work as a psychic but in secret. She'd never done anything like it before, but clients loved her. Sounds like the perfect partner. She was my best friend. I shouldn't have put her in danger. Vivian, why would a legitimate businessman hire an assassin to kill his psychic? I told you, he became possessive. ♪ ♪ All right. You're gonna need someplace to stay. Stay at the Archive. We have a spare room. Don't worry about it. It's not as scary as it sounds. I know. It's your home. You didn't have one growing up. For you, the word "archive" means home. It's a cold reading. I mean, it's something about my voice when I said "archive." - It's... - Right, sure. I'll check in when I have something. What do you mean, "Right, sure"? What's with the tone, Kay? [Keyboard clacking, beeping] ♪ ♪ "Highest clearance per FBI Counterintelligence." Of course. I'll make a call. Kay: You know, I know a guy in Counterintelligence. I'll handle it. Kay. They don't play by the rules. And don't say, "Neither do I," because you do. Copy that. ♪ ♪ Are you sure you want to do this? You're doing me a favor, really. Keeps my mind off of... everything. Sheep, water, the number five, all good luck for you. Why is Dina falling for this chicanery? A fortune teller? Um, and what about... relationships? They've been rocky. Amen to that. Gives people hope. What's the harm? Hope is for the weak, my son. Do you listen to the things you say? This is why dating never works. What next? Voodoo? Ooh, careful. I have got the pins. [Door closes] You were born in 1967. And your father was... Peter? Did you... How? I didn't know you had a father. I thought you were built by evil scientists. I see your secret self. Oh, you do, do you? Well, I ain't got no secrets, love. So, don't use your powers on me. I don't believe in 'em. [Chuckles] [Scoffs] Yes. How'd you know his father's name? Dina. [Chuckles] Nicely played. What about you? I'm giving free readings... one day only... for anyone who saved my life. I don't believe that the stars determine my life. I like to make my own destiny. Suit yourself. Just seems like there's something on your mind. All right. What do you need? Birth date. Time of day you were born. I can give you the exact minute. Even better. June 5, 1987. 3:16 in the morning. Smart. Unlucky. - [Chuckles] - Sorry. And... ♪ ♪ There's a darkness in you. And it's growing, pulling you away from people who love you. ♪ ♪ Well, that's wrong. You messed that part up, I guess. Yeah, I agree. You don't have that kind of darkness. I've never seen a reading so off before. I gave you the wrong time. 3:16 is when my brother was born. That was some kind of test? N... I... [Sighs] You're worried about him. ♪ ♪ We haven't met. I'm Winslow. Jonathan. A friend of mine, he needs kidney dialysis. They transport him to a nearby hospital once a week. I'll say a prayer. It's a hassle. But it ain't all that bad. Security's pretty lax. Now, he could slip away pretty easy. The only problem is, he's cuffed to his bed. Hey, you're pretty handy with that kind of thing, aren't you? I can't help you. ♪ ♪ Think on it. ♪ ♪ Special Agent Greene. Special Agent Daniels. Let me guess, you need a favor. I need Counterintelligence to remember we're all on the same team. Our cases are more important. I can't help that. You should join us. Best of the best and all that. Happy where I am. What do you know about Miller Mackenzie? Works out of Hong Kong. His file is restricted. Yeah, right, right. Um, real-estate guy. With a locked file? Why? What's your interest? His name came up in a murder investigation. Murder? That's not Miller's bag. File's restricted because with that much real estate, he's bound to rent to a money launderer or two. That's it? That's it. ♪ ♪ I don't know, I feel like Johnny was doing fine in prison, you know, I mean, like, well enough, then I-I get him involved in this case and I feel like I started something, and now, I don't know, I think maybe he's in trouble 'cause of me. You realize I'm not a therapist? Yeah, I know. I don't know, I just can't tell when he's lying, you know? It takes effort to lie. Next time you visit, look him in the eyes and ask. If there's a flicker in his energy, his focus, you'll see it. A flicker in his focus? Okay. What's this? Oh, hey, we were just, uh, talking about the case. She's lying to us. What? What? Who is Miller Mackenzie really? His FBI file is restricted, and when I said his name to Counterintelligence, the temperature dropped 10 degrees. Look at me. You know I am not leaving here until you tell me the truth. Who is Miller Mackenzie? He's an illegal arms dealer. A dangerous man. Why didn't you tell us that? When I first met Miller, I ignored the warning signs. He paid me a lot of money. Then I realized what I was doing... reading his enemies, his supposed friends. He used me to sell guns to dictators and cartels. And you blame yourself? People died because of me. Vivian, do you have any records, anything we could use to link him to criminal activities? My notes... from our readings. - Where are they? - In the desk at the parlor. Center drawer, there's a false bottom. I can show you. No. No. It's too dangerous. The assassin Miller hired could be staking out the parlor hoping for you to go back so he can finish the job. We could go. It's a good idea. Grab your wand. I don't have a wand. It's... a thing she does. It's hilarious. You're hilarious, Kay! [Buzzer] ♪ ♪ [Grunts] People don't usually say no to me. No. My friend with the bum kidney. You're gonna help him escape from the hospital. See, you got a broken rib that needs tending to. I'm fine. They'd check me. Don't worry, Mr. Black. [Crack] Ohh! [Coughs, wheezes] I thought about that, too. ♪ ♪ [Gasps] ♪ ♪ Daniels, FBI. We called ahead. I'll show you back. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Her notes are gone. She said they'd be there. Does that mean...? The assassin got to them first. Anyone else been here? No. Not since I arrived. How do you identify a hit man? Well, the best are unassuming. They're inconspicuous. Boring even. Do you have a pen? If anyone suspicious shows up, call me immediately. You got it. Cameron. ♪ ♪ [Mouths] One, two, three. ♪ ♪ Classic palm. Nice. Backup requested, 245 Baxter. How'd you know it was him? Shoes are Prada and the pen he gave me is a Montblanc. Stay here. Freeze! Put down the gun. Not gonna happen. [Gun cocks] Put it down. Now. Greene? What are you doing here? This is my case. Deakins: You were running an active operation on our suspect and you didn't tell us? Operational security. You know the drill. Right. God forbid Counterintelligence share intel. That's not what this was about. Fine. Tell us what it is about. I've been working on Miller Mackenzie for two years. I have a team of agents under cover, posing as weapons buyers. Problem is, every time we're about to make a deal, he pulls out. He sent a hit man to kill Vivian. Can't you get him on that? Quincy James, our hit man, was hired through the dark web. They never met. Only way to put Miller behind bars is to get him on weapons charges. That's why Vivian needs to go back to him. Wait, what? Miller will only make the deal if Vivian tells him it's safe. He didn't send Quincy to kill her. He wants her back. And if he doesn't get her, our whole operation falls apart. ♪ ♪ This is insane. They want Vivian to convince Miller to go through with a fake arms deal? This is the guy she's running from. You don't have to, Vivian. No one's forcing you to do this. But this is the only way to put him behind bars, right? To end this? You can't feel guilty about what happened with Irene. All right? That was not your fault. I know. But I want to make my own destiny. Somebody once told me that. Yeah, well, that guy's not always right. Miller will never stop. I can't spend the rest of my life wondering when the next hit man will appear or worried I'm gonna get someone else killed. I have to do this... no matter how dangerous it is. All right. But it won't be easy. Miller's not only paranoid. He grew up in Hong Kong. He's obsessed with Chinese culture and symbology. One bad sign and it won't matter how good my reading is. He'll kill the deal. I can't make the universe give him auspicious signs. Leave that to me. ♪ Oo-oo-oo ♪ ♪ Oo-oo-oo ♪ ♪ Oo-oo-hoo ♪ I've seen your show, John. I'll be watching you.

Handcuffed to the bed, remember? ♪ Oo-oo-hoo ♪ [Pounding on door] [Speaks indistinctly] So, this is the Deception Group? Indeed. We aim to deceive! Give him a chance. What's the plan? All right, our minds are designed to look for signs. Good ones, bad ones. The question is, which signs do we belive in? Our plan is to show Miller Mackenzie exactly the right signs that he needs to see to make the deal with your agents. Are you about to turn that into a horseshoe? [Chuckles] What? No, that would be ridiculous. We've put together a proposal. We're gonna need access to Miller's favorite hotel, control of the lobby and the elevators, and lots of undercover agents. And lots of fish. You didn't say anything about fish. It was a late addition. You'll love it. There is one more thing. Outside of fish? Yeah. For the deception to work, one of your agents will need to pose as Quincy James, the assassin, to deliver Vivian. Now, we know they never met, so physical type doesn't matter, but he will need to be an expert at sleight of hand. And why is that? Miller uses his own personal Mahjong tiles for every reading. We'll need to swap 'em out. My people can't do sleight of hand. He knows. Oh, you know what? I could do it. I could pose as Quincy, make the switch. Plus, Viv knows me, so, you know, I could keep an eye on her. - He's a civilian. - Cameron's good, and we'll have agents nearby if anything happens. What do you say? [Cellphone vibrates] Quincy's phone. [Cellphone beeps] Miller's asking for an update. Wants Quincy to call. I guess that's you. ♪ ♪ Miller. Mr. Mackenzie, I have your psychic.

We don't have time to wire a different room. We'll be blind. We won't know what's happening in there. This is the only shot we've got. Cameron? We've got bigger problems. 2058's door is the wrong color. We painted 2028 red. The rest are still white. White symbolizes death. We have to change it. Dina, try and get him to keep 2028. Mm-hmm. Why is it taking so long? The computer's just a bit slow. Mr. Mackenzie, between you and I, Room 2028 is a much better room. The park's views at sunset are just stunning. I want 2058. As you wish. Gunter, I need a red door to 2058 in two minutes. What? I can't paint a door that fast. Are you insane? Then move it. Move now. Don't worry, Cameron. I got it. Thanks, Jordan.
