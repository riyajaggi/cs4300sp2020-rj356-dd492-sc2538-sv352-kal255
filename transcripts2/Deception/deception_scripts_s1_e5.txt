 While nobody knew I had a twin brother behind the scenes until the night he was framed for murder. After the wreck, I tried to save her. She wasn't the woman from the car. This body was a different woman. I knew it wasn't an accident. I was set up. Now I've teamed up with the FBI. - You're Cameron Black. - That's Agent Kay Daniels... - I know a few tricks, too. - And we have a deal. She helps me prove my brother's innocent, I help her solve the kind of crimes

 only a master of deception could crack. I feel like we should be chasing somebody. Thankfully, I don't work alone. For my team of illusionists, there's no criminal we can't trick, no killer we can't track. Like I always say, "Nothing's impossible." It's easy to get distracted in life. The world's so full of noise. You try to focus on what's important... Your health, your family... But it's masked by money to be made, power to be seized. You can't help it.

 Your eye is drawn away. So you get lost... and look harder, searching everywhere for answers without realizing that sometimes, the things that matter the most... are right in front of you. It's Bishop! Ladies and gentlemen, your enthusiasm is undeniable. This is ridiculous. You've been six minutes. You're gonna pass out. Nah, it's fine. I got it. I just... You're pulling a Criss Angel. Do not say that name! Okay, bring him down now. No, ignore it. God, I'm just... I'm just a little rusty. I need practice. If blood flow to his head stays steady, we'll have a total meltdown of bodily function in... 40, 39, 38... Cameron, get down this instant. Relax. I'm not gonna die for like another 36 seconds. Have you heard from Jonathan lately? Hey, Kay. Kind of busy right now. A prisoner named Ethan Dollar escaped from Rockland Prison's medical center. A hospital? That's not an escape. This is an esc... Damn it. This is a... Jonathan was in the same room when it happened. What? That doesn't mean he was involved. Well, you and your brother do break out of places for a living. I thought I'd ask. Hell yeah, we do. Alright. Up top, Gunter. Seven-minute escape. Up top, my ass. Cameron. Did Jonathan say anything to you? Yeah. He said he wasn't involved. Do you believe him? I know my brother. Well, keep an eye on him. Prison can change people. Okay. Can I get an "attaboy" from somebody? Jordan? Seriously, upstaged by the Internet? Just got a ping on my news feed. Bishop's in town. He's at work in the Financial District. Wait, right now? That's cool. What's happening? Well, it's Bishop. He's a street artist. These guys are obsessed with him. Imagine Gandhi, Banksy, and Picasso all had a baby who grew up to be like... Like "Three Men and a Baby?" No, it's not like that at all. Bishop did the "Money House Mural" at Occupy... And "The Drowning Loudspeaker" after Katrina. He's like a people's hero. I'm sensing some deeper feelings here. No, it's... Our boy Cameron's got a chip on his shoulder. I don't have a chip. It's not a chip. I don... Gunter, would you not... that... Confess to the chip. He humiliated Cam in Vegas. Hey! At the time, you said it was cool. At the time, I lied. Alright, okay, fine. He got me pretty good, but here's the thing, right? He painted this on the side of a casino, alright? Armed guards, thousands of cameras, every security feature imaginable, and he got away with it. I mean, that I respect. This guy... he's not just an artist. He's a master of deception. That's St. Mary's Cathedral. It's close. Who wants to go? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Gunter! - Yep. Hey, you didn't tell me about the escape. Don't lie to me, Cam. Is Jonathan alright? Well, my brother's not exactly generous with his feelings these days, but, yeah, he's fine. At least, he says he's fine. He doesn't want you to worry. That's not the same thing. To be honest, though, I thought you'd given up on him. I mean, you haven't visited once. Jonathan broke my heart. It doesn't mean I don't care. I mean... does he ever ask about me or...? I think he's afraid to. What he did... can't take that back. Amazing. Unbelievable. Speak of the devil. Johnny, you're not gonna believe this. What, we finally have some good news? We're downtown and Bishop painted this huge mural that's like 12 stories high, and it's a huge "screw you" to Wall Street. So your weekly "Mystery Woman Update" is you're having a spectacular evening? Well, no, I was just... It's... you know, it's Bishop. Y-You love Bishop, so I was just... Cam, I'm rotting in prison. My exposure to art is now limited to abstract blood spatters and misspelled gang tattoos. One thought keeps me going... You out there working to get me free. Look, I'm not saying don't live your life, just maybe just don't rub it in my face, okay? Do we have any real updates? Not yet, but soon, I promise. Enjoy your evening. Stand back from the crime scene. They still looking for Bishop? No. Look at that. Someone just stole the stained glass window. Reverend Marks, what can you tell us about the stolen window? How long have you got? It's been the centerpiece of the church since the 1900s. Of course, the church dates back to the 17th century. Everything here is a national landmark. Alexander Hamilton's grave is right over there. Hip graveyard. Well, my boys love the soundtrack. I'm... I'm so sorry. I can't imagine why someone would do this. Since this is a national monument, the FBI will take the lead. We understand how important this is. Thank you. Well, either there's a giant tunnel underneath this church, or this was an inside job. I mean, how else do you move a window that big? You use a giant, industrial crane. And not a single person saw? Or a lot of people saw, and our thieves made sure no one cared. Who cares what some construction crane is doing when the legendary Bishop is across the street? It's called masking. It's one of the fundamental principles of magic. You hide something in plain sight, simply by creating... a better show. Got it. The sparks were a distraction. Not quite. Can I borrow your handcuffs? The trick was the distraction. The thieves needed Bishop's show to pull off the robbery. They had to have known where he planned to paint. So you think they're working together, but that doesn't make sense 'cause Bishop's not a criminal. He breaks into places, defaces property... He's been a criminal for a while. But not like that. I mean, Bishop's morality, his ideals, are half the reason he's famous. Well, let's talk to him, find out what's changed. That's gonna be difficult. Nobody knows who he is, let alone where to find him. He's a public icon who's worked for decades. Somebody knows him. Wait. What? It's kind of a long shot, but... Bishop had a-a rival... This graffiti artist, King Switch. Kind of a legend in his own right. Now, he used to be anonymous, but nowadays, he has a gallery in Soho. Soho? It's pretty fancy. Can't be good for his street cred. Yeah, these days, Switch isn't so concerned with street cred. Someone loves himself. Really? No, yeah, it's kind of over the top. See anything you like? Kay Daniels, FBI. Cameron Black, FBI... observer. Well, my days of infamy are long behind me, Agent Daniels. But if you wanna slap the cuffs on me, I will gladly reconsider. We're investigating a theft that Bishop may have been involved in. We hoped you might help us find him. Well, there's a mood killer. I don't mess with Bishop anymore. You two were rivals for years. Yeah, we dogged each other's work. I dissed him, he dissed me. See? You already have one of these? - No. - No. So what happened? For me, it was fun, you know? But for Bishop, it was, you know, political. Feed the poor, eat the rich, blah, blah, blah. It's like, "Dude, spray your name." Move on. Go." Not your style? Look, I'm not even registered to vote. He said, "Graffiti should be told, not sold," and I'm like, "I don't know." You wanna buy my work on a t-shirt, "go ahead, mazel tov." You should also check out my, cookbook... "Switch in the Kitch." Bishop's work, it... It made money, though, right? It sold. Yeah, that's 'cause people stole them off the wall and sold them for millions. And he didn't like that. Yeah, that's when he got angry. That's when he became an anarchist. Lashed out, he even trashed some of my pieces, torched the whole building. Even threatened my life. Think he could actually hurt you? Hell yeah. When Bishop went cuckoo, this guy EPOK from Chicago, he paints this big-ass mural that says, "Bishop's reign is over." What happened to EPOK? That's just it. Nobody one knows. Totally disappeared. New profile of Bishop fits the bill. He's making people disappear, robbery's no big deal. Yeah, I just... Whoa, Kay. "King Snitch." Somebody just did this. That's Bishop's work. We have to warn him. Forensics is still picking through the scene, but I wouldn't hold your breath for any leads. Find Switch's body? Nothing yet. An explosion that good doesn't leave much behind. Bishop's a genius, and he used to use that genius to fight for change, and now he's using it to commit murder. That's... confusing. Sometimes people only need a nudge to change for better or worse. Bishop must've found another reason for what he's doing. One worth killing for. The question is... what? This is every mural Bishop's done in the last three years. He pops into a city, paints three pieces, and then moves on to his next location. But the last three cities he's visited have coincided with robberies that used the same M.O. as the job at St. Mary's. Bishop paints a masterpiece while a crew pulls off a heist nearby. He's smart. Taggers share a lot of skills high-end thieves use. But the thefts so far have been low profile... A book from a museum, an old violin from a private collection. That explains why no one saw the connection. But now that Bishop's stealing national monuments and killing people, we've noticed. Well, we tied him to a guard murdered in Prague and to a curator killed in Dublin. Switch wasn't his first. He follows his pattern, he'll pull two more jobs before he leaves New York. We've got NYPD on the case, but I want agents on the ground. Let's dig into the street art scene here and see what we turn up. What are you doing? Working. Yeah, I was right. See, look at the dates. The Mystery Woman was in Paris and Berlin the exact same time as Bishop. I think they're connected. Cameron, those are possible "MW" sightings. We've had hundreds of them all across Europe since we put out the Interpol Red Notice. It's not enough to go on. I disagree. But I do like "MW" for Mystery Woman. It's very professional. Is it possible you're seeing a connection because you want there to be one? Look, you got to let me run with this. We've done it your way this whole time, and we have made zero progress on Mystery Woman. This is an actual lead. That's the way investigations work. They take time. Please don't get your hopes up, or Jonathan's. This is something. Can I show him? Thank you. See! Bishop's tags coincide perfectly with the Mystery Woman sightings. I figure we catch him, maybe he leads us to her. This is at least as cool as when I figured out the Hoover Dam illusion. Jordan figured that out. It was teamwork. This is a real lead, Johnny. It's a hunch, Cam. Come on, it's... it shows we're on the right track. We can actually solve this thing. Alright, you do that. I'll work on solving what was in the "root dish" they served last night. We think yams and sawdust. Wait, "we". Not the "let's get matching neck tattoos" kind of friends, but, yeah, I'm trying to fit in. Johnny, try not to fit in too much. You know, especially if that involves breaking one of your new friends out of prison. I already told you, that wasn't me. And yet it so obviously was. If you get caught, everything we're doing to help you is for nothing. They're out of order. What? These murals, they're in the wrong order. How do you know? I'm super smart. There's a pattern. Each one of these contains the image of a flower. But... they progress. What order were those painted in? The exact order you just put them. There's a whole bunch of repeated elements in these pictures. You got shapes, colors, numbers. And these are more than just works of art, these are coded messages. This is how Bishop talks to his team. That's great, Johnny. I mean, th-there's definitely more, I just don't know what it is. You decode those, you'll know his plan. And stop his next job. Of course, it won't be easy. I mean, this is masterful stuff. You'll need the whole team. Alright. Gotta go. Cam. I hope you're right. Me, too. An autopen? That's like trying to crack a code with an abacus. You want to stop playing Myspace and try and help us solve this case? This program is like having 5,000 code crackers working at the same time. It's slop, that's all that is. Yeah? What's going on in here? Well, Gunter's using an antique autopen to recreate the mural shading patterns while Jordan's analyzing it using the crypto software that the FBI gave us. Where did you get this thing, Doug Henning's fan club? Don't you dare use Doug's name in vain. - Don't go in there. - No. Put your balls in here, son, I'll crush them for you. How's Jonathan? Good. Yeah, he's fine. You're lying to me. Don't do that. I'm worried he might be caught up in something. May I? Last time we spoke, I offered you employment and you turned me down. I meant no disrespect. I'm glad. I decided to let you reconsider my offer. A permanent place on my team. I don't want any trouble. Trouble? We all good. It's them you got to worry about. So far, we know the log's your calendar and the bat and moon are a clock, 15 tonight. So now we just have to narrow in on a specific address. Yes! Yes! I got a match! There's hidden patterns in the shading. We need to align them together. That's my theory. I was doing the shading. Yeah, try a computer next time. There's shading patterns all over the place. How do you put them together? We've been looking at it wrong. The answer isn't inside the image, it is the image. If we align these correctly, it'll give us a model. Drop the arts and crafts, man. I-I got this one. Look. The pattern in the mural creates a 3-D image. The statue at Rockefeller Center. Kay, It's Rockefeller Center, that's the next target. Spread out! Bishop is medium build, 6 feet tall. Let's go. Be ready! He may be armed. He was just here. Yo? They just robbed a penthouse on 6th. NYPD's there. Thieves are gone. Are we too late? - What's happening? - It's Bishop. No, there! FBI! Stop! Don't move. You're under arrest, Bishop. Kay, did you find him. How old is Bishop? Late 30s, 40s, he's been tagging 15 years. Sorry, Cameron, we got some kid. So, what do we call you? Ben Evans of Bushwick or Mekka, the elusive street artist? Ben has two arrests... A B&E; and one for defacing city property. While Mekka has 100,000 followers on Instagram. Let's go with Mekka. I like him more. We know you did the Rockefeller mural. The paint on your shirt matches that on the wall exactly. It was an ugly wall. So why does the FBI care? Because a man's dead. The street artist, Switch? He was murdered by Bishop. Murdered? The stencil you used at Rockefeller? That was Bishop's design. You're working for him. That makes you an accessory to murder. I got no idea what you're talking about. While you were painting, Bishop's thieves stole an antique German watch from a nearby penthouse. All original parts, valued at $2,000. Why did he want that? Come on, talk to us, Mekka. The antique watch, the stained glass window, what are they for? Or you can tell us where Bishop is. We can ask him instead. I already said I don't know what you're talking about. Remember, no passing objects between one another. My brother knows the drill. It's not your brother. Hey. Want to sit? Um, I'm sorry to just show up like this. I know it's been a while. No, I-I-I didn't think you were ever gonna... I'm sorry about... I-I didn't come here for an apology. I'm... I'm worried about you. I heard a rumor that you may have help a prisoner escape last week. Cam telling stories? Jonathan... I know you did it. What I don't know is why. We're doing everything that we can to get you out of here. I mean, what happened? Why would you jeopardize that? Our ultimate Frisbee season was wrapping up. Also, I just kind of needed to fill the time. You don't have to lie to me. I'm not Cameron. I know that he sees the world optimistically and... Optimistically. Cameron Black wears rose-colored glasses, dipped in honey and plated with gold. Look, what's going on? Let me help you. I'm just... I'm just alone in here. I know. No, you don't. You have a choice. You can either do as your told or you can fight like hell. Risk it all and hope that you come out on top. And I don't want to. I don't... I don't want to risk it all. I want to get the hell out of here and I want a chance to... to make things right. I'm trying. I promise. I know. Just hold on, okay? Wait, I don't get it. So Deakins just let Mekka go? Why didn't you call me? Could've tortured a confession out of him. Using illusions, obviously. We didn't have any actual evidence tying him to the crime. Well, did he at least tell you why Bishop's stealing all these random antiques? I don't think he knows. What about Mystery Woman... And how she's involved? She's not. I had the Bureau run a deeper check on her sightings in Berlin and Paris. The ones that corresponded to Bishop's heists. Don't tell me. False alarms. I'm sorry. What am I doing, Kay? You're trying to solve a mystery. It's not easy. I ignored you... again. Told Johnny. Got his hopes up. Now he thinks we're close to getting her. This is gonna crush him. We're never gonna get her, are we? Hey, Cameron. The day will come that we get a lead on Mystery Woman and bring her ass to prison. It's just not today. I'm sorry about Jonathan. But we've still got a killer on the loose and we need your help to stop him. The instructions for Bishop's next heist must be in here. Yeah, it's just a simple image, so I don't... Nothing's jumping out at me. Is your face on that pen? Yeah. You always have swag on you? Used to sell it at shows. Now I just hand it out to kids when they want to see a trick. A lighter? Kids love it. Kidding. It's not the coolest design, though. You know what, maybe I should have Mekka do it. Don't think he'd talk to you. He's too scared after what happened to Switch. He's worried he's next. What if he is? I didn't know who else to call. He must've seen you get picked up. But it was a misunderstanding. You know, maybe I could just get word to him... No, he definitely wants to kill you no matter what. Cameron painted that? Photoshop. They did a large format printout. Looks good. Okay, so what the hell am I gonna do? Well, if you talk to us, we can help you. But we need to know what we're up against. How did Bishop find you? A few weeks ago, a graffiti writer stopped me in Brooklyn and said that he was Bishop. The Bishop. How'd you know it was him? I watched him. He was amazing. He had the maddest skills I've ever seen. He asked if I would help him with his New York residency. So it was, like, a dream come true, you know. And how did it work? He gave me this. Told me to show up there, do the piece, and leave, so I did. Then I saw those guys busting the window out of the church. And that's when I realized that Bishop was just using me. There was some larger plan. Yeah, yeah. The next day, I get this under my door. The mural from the Rockefeller Center. So I showed up again. But this time, I was actually watching for the theft. The guy had a whole system. There were four taggers. Mekka painted murals, spelling out the instruction for the next job without even knowing it. While the other three used the instructions to pull the heists. Genius. Can't trace it back to Bishop. So, what's the next job? There isn't one. This is what Mekka was supposed to paint next. It's too simple to be a coded message or a distraction. Alright. It's Mekka's personal throw-up. It's like a graffiti signature. Every tagger has one. Why does Bishop want Mekka to paint his own tag? It works like an ID, right? Proves you are who you say you are. So you can get into some place secure. That's it. Bishop wants to meet, but he has to make certain it's really Mekka. We've got a time and a place. Bishop will be there. Not when Mekka doesn't show. Well, what if Mekka does show? You think you can impersonate Mekka? Match a signature that only he can paint, that's... Kay, don't say impossible. Now, listen. I'll print Mekka's tag on the north-most wall. It's covered in graphite dust. Used the compressed air in this can... Blow off the dust and reveal Mekka's tag. I got it. Still don't get why I couldn't paint the tag myself. Remember that smiley face? It's not my best work. Yeah, you're a great magician, boss, but a crap street artist. Remember, mask it with your body, and they won't know the difference. This butane's flammable. So stay away from them power lines. Push nozzle. Make air. Blow dust. I got it. Okay, so earwig is set. We've got a tracker on you. Tactical team is ready to go. Copy that. We're close by. As soon as you see Bishop, say the word, we're there. Which word. Just kidding. Hey, look, I'm sorry I hit a rough spot yesterday... No. You did good. Kept your head in the game. Bounced back. Guess you're rubbing off on me. What was that about just needing a nudge to change? Oi! Hurry up before the dust blows off. I think that's your cue. This is some of the best climbing I've done. You seeing this? Cameron, try not to talk. Bishop may recognize Mekka's voice. No chit-chat. Copy that. Any sign of Bishop? No, he's not here yet. - Well, what do you see? - Water tower. Cooling unit. Some real-estate opportunities. Surprisingly fit naked old man exercising. Check that. It's not exercising. You Mekka? Yeah, hi. Okay, let's see that mark. Alright, remember, northern wall. Right hand trace, left hand fill. Use your body to mask it. Nothing's going to happen, Cameron. Good luck. - God... - What? You can't say that. What are you waiting for? Just finding my groove. Okay. Let's hope this works. Cam, it's working. Of course it is. I designed it. Cameron, they're moving in too close. Use your body to mask it. - Should we pull him out? - No, no, no. He's not done. He's not done. Hang on. What is this? Hey, back off, man. Give him a better show. Easy, man. You already got the job. Everyone get ready to move in. They're about to bring in Bishop for the meet. Alright, Bishop's waiting for us. Keep up or you're out. - Whoo! - Guys... - Whoo! - They're flying away. Bishop's not coming here. They're going to him. You got this. Just like 2012. "Leap of Death." Yeah, when he spent a month in the hospital. Not helpful, guys. We need to work on our radio etiquette. Drive! We have to keep up. All agents, keep eyes on Cameron. Do not lose him. Don't worry. I'm keeping up remarkably well. Keep up! Whoa! They're moving like this so we can't follow them. Yeah, I've noticed. Cameron, we've lost sight of you. Tell us where you're headed. Toward a brick building. They're all brick. Be specific. Turn left. Yeah! Whoo! Let's go! Whoo! Oooookay. I can't make that. You're a bit rusty. Don't be ashamed if you have to call it a day. I'm not rusty. I just... You gave us a whole speech about how you're rusty. Cameron, you listen to me. Don't do anything crazy, you understand? Yeah, never do. Hyah! Might've done something crazy. - Cameron? - Alright, guys, for the next 30 seconds, I'm gonna need total silence. He's gonna fall. Of course he is. There's no way he makes this. Guys! You never use a radio before? Okay, no more headsets for you two. Take them off. Now. Okay. Not dead. Heading into the building now. Mekka. FBI caught wind of us. Bishop's shutting down the team. Our cash will be in the usual places. This will be the last time we meet. Let's take off our masks and finish this face to face. You heard what I said? Yeah, yeah, I know. I just... This knot is super tight. I'm great at tying knots, you know. Too great. Hey. Don't I know you from somewhere? Nope. No. Definitely not. Got one of those faces. It's Cameron Black. Wait, Switch. You're Bishop? I-I-I don't understand. Doing a little something for the FBI. And it's cute. Too bad it's not gonna work out. What are you waiting for? Take him to the roof and throw his ass off. The man is a magician. You obviously don't know what that means, guys. You see, my brother and I, we grew up the road, performing on my father's show. Strange city after strange city. A lot of sketchy promoters. Always paid in cash, so we were easy targets for thieves. Winslow sends his regards. Our dad, he, - he taught us more than just magic. Look, man... He taught us to survive. - We're here. - Cameron, we're coming. Stay here. Tell us if you see anything. A gun? What happened, man? You used to be Bishop. I still am Bishop. Switch paid the bills. Guess you don't need him anymore now that Bishop's become a murdering thief. You think this is about money? When I spoke truth to power, nobody listened. Everyone pretends they want to save the world. Really, they just want a piece of it to put on their mantle. Alright, so your fans let you down. This is, what, revenge? No, they're not revenge. I gave up all that societal crap. I've been shown the light. And we are building something new. What? What are you building? I don't get it. Why would you steal a stained glass window and some old watch? I'm not. We're returning them. Watch out. He's got a gun. Who's got a gun? A Master of Deception. There are a dozen of these. If each is another road map, another plan... That's a lot of unfinished business. You think Cameron's team can help us out? Is he okay? I'll talk to him. Go through Dina. She knows how to handle her team. My pleasure. Sometimes they get away. But we're the FBI. Eventually, we always get our man... or window. Guess what was stashed between the walls upstairs? National landmark returned safe and sound... ish. Where's the other half? We don't know. But we recovered the other panels. And the watch? Still looking. But I bet Bishop's taggers are spilling their guts to Deakins as we speak. Apparently, they had the fear of God struck into them by this magician who also happens to be a world-class fighter. Not exactly your victory face. What's on your mind? Bishop said he was "shown the light." What do you think that means? Criminals justify their crimes for all kinds of reasons. Right, but he... He stole a watch worth two grand and a window worth $2 million. And then he says he's returning them. That doesn't make any sense. We're missing something, Kay. Not to encourage you, but the Bureau's doing some digging. The watch was made in 1913. Same year the window was installed. Another puzzle. It's like he's laughing at us. I mean, we still don't know why he changed. What he's after. Who he's working for. Cameron, we busted a criminal ring. Recovered a national monument. We got the notebook of our suspect who we've now ID'd. Take the win. What is it? Do I even want to know what happened? Do I want to know? Let's say it on three... One, two... So, the reason I came... I know why. You do? This is the part where you tell me your hunch about the Mystery Woman was wrong and you shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. It's alright. You don't have to apologize, Cam. I know you're doing the best you can. And... you can't just make clues appear out of thin air, alright? That is true. Everything that's happened in this case... I know who's behind it. But this isn't just about us, Johnny. All this... this is about something far greater. Greg, move your head.
