 Crusoe (2008â€“2009): Season 1, Episode 3 - Sacrifice - full transcript 
 Robinson recalls his marital past to explain why his wedding-band is so precious to him. It got lost while helping Friday trying to deal with a tormenting nightmare about a skull, which he believes to be the very one they find. The ritual cave yields a riddle-box, which they solve. It sets them on a treasure hunt-trail which proves perilous but leads to the tomb. There lurks more danger.

 t.me/@Abolix (MUTTERS) (GASPS) Crusoe. I have seen a woman. I know. Many, many women. No, no. I mean just now. Where? Down on the beach. Right here, right here. There's no footprints. She went on the water.

 Where's her boat? No boat. She walked. On the water? Yes, right there. This wasn't a dream you were having, by any chance, was it? Yes. Crusoe, there's a reason for all of this. (GRUNTS) Crusoe! There is no water again. Maybe we should find another spring. I've seen them all. None of them is pure like this one. None of them?

 I was sick for a month. The dog almost died. I think I know what it is. Something floats around in here and gets stuck. Watch out for the spirit in the rocks. (CHUCKLING) What? The spirit in the rocks. It can take the hand of a man right off. (SHOUTS) (EXCLAIMS) (LAUGHING) I'm sorry, Crusoe. I could not resist. Thanks a lot. I'm stuck now. I am sure you are. No, Friday. Really, really. Really? Yeah. Ow, ow! Stop, stop. Sorry, sorry. (GRUNTS) My ring's gone. My wedding ring. How am I supposed to get it back? Wait for it to wash out. Not gun powder. A wedding ring is a sacred object. It means something. Look at it this way. The gold came from the earth, and the earth took it back. You don't understand. You've never been married. But I've have had many, many women. It's not about many women. It's about one. We make a vow. That is different. The word of a man can be sacred. Bomb-boo. (BOTH LAUGHING) Right? Ready? No need to run. Speak for yourself. Crusoe. What? Where is the rest of the gun powder? We should run. Run, run, run! (GROANS) Do you think that cleared it, Crusoe? (GRUNTS) That must be what was blocking it up. What do you think? I do not know. It came from up there. Let's have a look. We are not the first ones here. Well, at least we got our clean water back. It's bitter. (SIGHS) Is it a tomb? FRIDAY: I think it is a water shrine. Maybe this belongs to the water gods, and I can swap it for my wedding ring. Do not joke about it, Crusoe. (RUMBLING) (YELLING) (GRUNTS) Give the box. (COUGHING) We should make that safe. (SQUAWKING) CLERIC: As long as you both shall live. Robinson Crusoe, wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife? To live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony? I will. Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor and keep her, in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only to her as long as you both shall live? I will. (PEOPLE CHEERING) Did you hear him? He jumped in too early. Didn't he just. (BELL TOLLING) Well... They swore a bond to rush it through. But the marriage is legal. Good. Why do you ask? Concern for their souls. You did not see her face, Crusoe. I was not scared until I saw her face. What does she look like? That! (SIGHS) What you had is called a nightmare. Wax! This is the only side with wax on it. She was there. She led me to the beach. (LAUGHING) In a dream, Friday. She is trying to tell me something. I need to find out what it is. We believe that work is the life of the spirit in the body. When that spirit sleeps or dies, the soul roams. No. Crusoe, you dream of Susannah, yes? Sometimes I do, yes. That is your two souls coming together. Even though you're worlds apart. I learn from you, Crusoe. Why will you not learn from me? She was as real to me as Susannah is to you. Like I said, it was a nightmare. Now will you please help me? (GASPS) This has got to be the way in. There are slots like this on every side. Maybe they have to be opened in a particular order. Right. The cube has six faces. Six times 5, times 4, times 3, times 2, times 1. Seven hundred and twenty different ways to try and open it. What about we throw it off the side of the tree house and see what it does? All the sides have different colors. Yellow. Blue. Green. Brown. Red and white. That is the order. How did you figure that out? (BREATHING HEAVILY) Yellow is for the sun. Blue for the sky. Green is for the waves of the water. Brown is for the air. And red... Red is for the blood of the animals. And white is for death. (GASPS) It is her. Why would a dead woman bring me down to the beach? Every time I close my eyes, she brings me down here. She's a dream, not a ghost. Ghost? English superstitions. Wandering spirits. Someone does them some terrible wrong in this world, and they walk the Earth until the body is laid to rest. Then I have seen a ghost. Yes. But in your dreams. Why don't you dream of something useful? Look what the tides brought. You can laugh. You disturbed her. But I am the one she has chosen. All right, I plead guilty. But what can I do about it? How do you lay a spirit to rest? Those are just stories. And you are a rational man. Tell me, Crusoe, what can we do? You know, this doesn't look so bad. We could patch it up, use it to collect rain water. Maybe she is the one who turned our water sour. (CHUCKLES) I've heard of people adding water to spirits, but never the other way round. And soon it will be all the water on the island. What do you mean? She took your wedding ring for a reason. She made our water bad for a reason. Already, we are at the mercies of the skies. Now, what makes you think she will stop at one spring? Dig. You see it, do you not, Crusoe? Just because I appreciate a ghost story, doesn't mean I believe in ghosts. It's the same as your wandering spirits. Do you not believe that when you dream of Susannah, she dreams of you? Don't you think I want to? It would comfort me to think it, but that doesn't make it so. I will shore up the entrance. Then I want to see those pictures again. And I will look out for your ring, since it seems to be so important to you. We took a vow. So long as you both shall live. Then you do not need the ring. True. But since I don't have the woman at the moment, I'd at least like the ring. That is not much of a substitute. I'm sorry this is of so little interest to you. You know better than that, Crusoe. I saw the skull woman again last night. I think her spirit is set on tormenting mine. I do see Susannah, and I see the children. But not with your same kind of spirits. Unless of course they've come to torment me for ignoring all the signs I was given in this world. CRUSOE: Even Susannah's father could see them. You should have heard his first words to his new son-in-law. You people chose the wrong side in the civil war. Don't imagine the king will forget it. Ah, that was 30 years ago. A blink of an eye in the great scheme of things. I know you don't approve of me, sir. I don't disapprove of you, Robinson. I was just hoping she'd make a better choice. (LAUGHS) Thank you. You understand what I mean. Things could turn. My daughter could wake up one morning to find the father of her children is an enemy of the crown. I'm a merchant, sir, that's all that I am. City merchants. A well-known nest of Republicans. And first against the wall if James gets the throne. What hope have you then? I'll still have Susannah. And I'll still drop you. The moment you dissent, our families fall out of favor. I can hardly be blamed for something that happened before I was even born. Robinson... You should break with your family and make some new friends. (EXHALES DEEPLY) And if this rather generous dowry makes that possible, I shall consider it money well spent. I swear to you, sir, that I won't touch a penny of Susannah's dowry. But I will hold it in trust for her security, just in case I should ever fail her as badly as you expect me to. (GROWLING) What was that? Friday! How long was I talking to myself? I merely left you to your most devoted audience. Look at this. FRIDAY: These drawings tell a story. What do they say? You made a joke about the box belonging to the water god. There is a knife and a high priest. She was a human sacrifice. I need to lay her soul to rest. I accept it. Why can't you? We just don't believe in the same things. We do believe in the same things. Just in different ways. That is what you will not accept. You only recognize God if he speaks English. Hey, that's not fair. All I'm saying is that a man is made of two parts, body and soul. Your soul has a life beyond the body. What do you say, Crusoe? I can't argue with you. (CHUCKLES) I know. What do you want to do? Whatever she wants of me. Well, good luck finding that out. (GRUNTS) She has brought me this far. Put something in your Bible to remember us by. Even if I help you, that doesn't mean I've changed my mind. These people are not of the island. Indians from the mainland, perhaps. Shipwrecked and stuck here like me. I think I understand her now. Look, Crusoe. Her body was given to the sun. Her head to the Earth and her heart to the sea. To what purpose? Sacrifice to water. The spirit imprisoned in the spring. Hold this. How about this? We take what's left of her to the beach. And we throw it in the sea where her heart is. She showed you where, right? But her skull and her heart need to be with the bones to complete her. Now we have to find her bones. Yes, but the skull has to be hundreds of years old. The bones are long gone by now. Not if we can find the tomb. Look, Crusoe. I have to lay her body to rest. Just like your ghost stories. What do you think will happen if you do? I free her spirit, she stops tormenting mine. The water will be sweet again. And you, my friend, might even get your ring back. It means that much to you? What it means to me does not matter. Where do we start? There. (SIGHS) Not the first thing I had in mind when I woke up this morning. Some days are like that. I think we're in a watercourse. This should lead us straight to the holy place. What if it doesn't lead through? Well, we'll have to find another way up the mountain. You should feel good about this. It is a holy mission. (CHUCKLES) Where I come from, seeing God makes you a holy man. Seeing a skull-faced woman makes you a lunatic. Friday! Crusoe! It's not a trap. It's a sluice gate to control the flow of water. Something must have set it off. I did not touch anything. It's all right, I figured it out. Can we go now? Now I know how it works. These people knew things. Like how to slaughter women? Says the cannibal king. One day, I'll have to explain to you what that means exactly. (GROWLING) Did you hear something? Like the wind. I have been thinking about Susannah and your children. What about them? I know you worried about leaving them. But you said that they had their godfather for protection. This is true. Godfather sounds like a powerful man. Mr. Blackthorn certainly is that. CRUSOE: I remember what he did for me. It was the day that the king died. And my real troubles began. The king had a fit on Friday. Did you hear? Uncle, I've something I need to ask you. Increase your loan? Would you mind? Not at all. Is it a business opportunity or is there another child on the way? The truth is, I'm not finding many business opportunities. (SIGHS) Let's hope for a boy this time. Sir... You've always been so kind and taken an interest in me, but there's... There's nothing I can do to repay you. I've no family and it pleases me to be a friend of yours. That's all. (BELL TOLLING) WOMAN: The king is dead! MAN: The king is dead. You hear that? MAN: Long live the king! Long live the king. (BELL TOLLING CONTINUES) Is that daylight? Yes. It opens up. That's a relief. Not exactly. Should we go back? Find a different way? No. I thought you'd say that. It is not too bad. If it was 2 feet off the ground, you would not think twice. Well, let's do it then. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Crusoe, are you there? I'm right behind you. Okay. It is fine. If you just look at the path. What's to worry about? We're only 2 feet off the ground, remember? (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Just watch that bit. Crusoe? Crusoe? It's all right. I'm okay, I'm okay. Okay. Something's just occurred to me. What's that? This bridge is really old. Don't worry. It's really solid. Okay, I have an idea. How about we walk faster and talk less? That works for me. This was such a bad idea. (PANTING) See? We'll find another way off this mountain, even if we have to sprout wings and fly. If we have to sprout wings then we have no reason to. I see what you mean. Is there human sacrifice in England? We executed Charles I. I don't know if that counts. Well, what is the difference? None at all, if it's your head on the block. For 11 years, England had no king. No king? That is unnatural. Is this the end of it? I think so. What is this? Where'd these people come from? I'm just glad they went. Whatever road they took, let's find it. It's got to be better than the way we came. Crusoe. Look! The altar. (LAUGHS DELIGHTFULLY) It is not just the altar. If the picture is correct, it is also her tomb. There is something here. That's a lid. Yes, yes. (GRUNTING) I liked this one. We'll make another one. These joints, they're perfect. You can't get anything in to move it. Maybe we are not meant to. I'd say this tomb is much older than the skull. They had to have a way of opening it. So they could put the bones in it. I've got it. Look! The box! The pictograms! And the altar. What now? Good question. The one constant is these symbols. There must be a way to tie them together. Ah-ha! Interesting. It's a key. They're all keys! (GROWLING) (BOTH LAUGHING) I need a skull. (GROWLING CONTINUES) There's no slot for water. They are not making this easy. Doesn't make sense. There's five slots. There's got to be a sixth. Crusoe, are you praying? Praying I've got the right answer. Pass me the key. (RUMBLING) You will have to teach me that prayer. It's not a miracle, it's water pressure. It's acting on a counterbalance point on the inside. Come on, give me a hand. (BOTH GRUNTING) What a horrible way to die. Alone and unloved. FRIDAY: Someone must have loved her. I don't see much evidence of that. If you do not give up something you love, it is no sacrifice. Now that's something I understand. I should gather the bones and we should go. (GROWLING) What was that? It's no wind. I'll help you. All right. Ready? Yes. Let's find another road off this mountain. Okay. (GASPS) (GROWLS) Where did that come from? Let's go back. Just back away. We'll go this way. (BOTH GASP) Okay, they're just wild dogs. They're more afraid of us than we are of them. Well, they hide their terror really well. They do not want to let us go. They don't want anything, they're just dogs. Where are they from, Crusoe? Where are they from? Spanish navy. They put dogs on the islands to decimate the wildlife. Makes it harder for pirates to get food. Strange. We have never come across them before. All right. Do you have another explanation? Maybe they are here to protect the bones. Well, why don't we just give them back then? No, Crusoe. Well, if you're right, then they'll leave us alone. No, Crusoe. Okay. There is only one other choice. What? You ready? Go! Go! Go, go, go! (BOTH GRUNTING) (BOTH GASPING) I see a problem. We can't go across that. We have no choice. Okay. Go, go! (GROWLING) We can trap them. Stop. Stop. You close the sluice gate. I'll hold them off. With what? With this. Close the door. Crusoe. It is closing. Crusoe, now! You all right? (BOTH PANTING) Those were dogs, right? Whatever you want them to be, Crusoe. On the way out, you didn't, by any chance, happen to see... No, no, I did not see your wedding ring. (GROWLING) Did you hear that? Let us finish this. I don't see it. Stop. I don't see it. Maybe it did not get through. What are you willing to bet? That was one determined dog. This has to be done with reverence, not with haste. How about some hasty reverence? If we do this right, then it will be over. I hope your spirit woman appreciates this. Listen to me. Hey, Friday! Friday! (GRUNTING) (BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY) What just happened? Should have caught it and trained it. Could have been a friend to Dundee. It would have eaten Dundee. (BOTH LAUGHING) (SQUAWKING) We did a good thing today, Crusoe. Just helping out a friend. It was more than that and you know it. You will be rewarded. I'd settle for a ship, and a compass to sail it by. Friday, the water's clean.
