 Dear Journal, we've all heard the legend of the giant's golden heart enchantment. Once I enter that big body and reach that big golden heart... it will enchant my sword! Dear Journal... Hmm? ...I seek the golden heart of the giant! Who is that? Then my shield shall be enchanted by its giant gold! Wait. Who is that?! - She looks... - Like he's after... - The same thing... - As me!

 Hyah! Hyah! The giant's enchantment belongs only to the worthiest one here! And that one... Hyah! is I, Tigtone! Ha! We'll see who the worthiest one here is when I get to the giant first. And that I... is... Beconka! Wow. Your moves, Tigtone! I could say the same about you... and I do! Are you thinking the same thing as me? Of course, a run-and-fight! All the way to the giant!

 Helpy, stay here, and, uh, help the barteener or something. Jacques! You stay here, too. - Wha? - But even more! Whoa! - Whoa! Ho ho! - Okay. Oh! Ha-ha! So, you are a sidekick, too, eh? Sidekick? Well, I'm Helpy. I... am Jacques. I am the Barteener. I need help! They don't call me Helpy for nothing! Let someone who is better than you sing about that, Helpus. It's actually Helpy. With a "pee." Ho! Ha! Ha! Giant! I'm here for your enchantment! Or die! No, Giant! I'm here for that, but... But better than her! Huh? Ha-ha-ha-ho, whoa-oh! Whosoever wishes to reach my Golden Heart must first pass through my... Ohh! ...treacherous internal landscape. I can enchant anything, but will only do so for the first to arrive. It's a race! Go now! Into me! Into my body! Yah! Yah! Aah! Aah! Must me cross this nasty river of bile? Ha! You're not going to let a bile river stop you from... Wait, what are you not stopping doing? - Hyah! - Ha-ha! Now that is a good idea! Ha-ha! That is a good idea! Ha-ha! Oh, ho ho! Ha ha! Hey! Ugh! Obstacles! Ha-ha! Problems! Ha-ha! I'll make short work of them. Not if I make shorter work of them faster! Hyah! Hyah! Tigtone! Beconka! Ohh. Aah! Don't let go. Never! Aah! Whoa! Don't let go. Never! Bleh. Ahh. This must be the final boss for me to defeat! Raaah! Ow! Now it is my turn to! And win! Hyah! We cannot fight this flesh monster alone... But we are not alone. Let us die fighting together! I always wanted someone to fight to the death with! I am glad it was you. I am glad I was me, too. Tigtone! Beconka! Gah! Rah! I've enjoyed questing against you, Tigtone, but now I must take my prize. Like hell! Make me! Whoa! Oh! Oh! Beconka! Tigtone! Ah ha ha! Come on, Giant! Do it to my shield! No! Do it to my sword, you giant! Enough! Your shameless display of violence towards each other... has proven you both worthy of my enchantment! But first, you must agree to a bargain. A bargain? Well, that wasn't part of the bargain! In exchange for my enchantment, you must each give me a small piece of your souls to live for all eternity in one of my infinite pocket dimensions. What is pocket dimension! Explain pocket dimension! Inside each of my many pocket dimensions exist tiny pieces of the brave warriors who came before you. Eh, that's fine. Yeah, take whatever. Ah, splendid. It shall be done. Okay, here we go! We have to stop him! I know, I'll use my claw. Yes, Helpy, yes! Cut me free so I can escape! Aah! Aah! Now regenerate and we will defeat this bandit. Ready, Jacques? Why would you think I can regenerate like you? So, the big hero Jacques cannot regenerate. Helpy... Give me some of your special powers to save my life! Of course! Open your mouth. Thank the gods! Now for the healing effects to take place. Nothing's happening! Helpy, why am I not regenerating? Because I didn't give you regenerative power! Never mess with Helpy. You killed him! Now the only one left to kill is you! Ha ha ha! Tigtone! Beconka! Aah! Um... so you'll want to know what happened to Jacques? No, not really. Well, Tigtone... Yes, Beconka? We have our own main quests to get back to. So, this is where we must part ways. Uh... okay. Dear Journal, I have defeated the Evil Sultan of Rio Pio. But it pales in comparison to my battle with Beconka. I shall miss fighting her all my days. Dear Journal, I smote the Attacktyls of Zilotrog and their eggs. But, still, I yearn, for Tigtone was truly the opponent of my dreams. If only there were a way for me to fight him for all eternity! But, alas, it was not meant to be. - Hyah! - Take that! Take that! Yes! Ha ha! Hey! Yes! That's right, they'll be fighting each other forever. Now I can die in peace... some day. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
