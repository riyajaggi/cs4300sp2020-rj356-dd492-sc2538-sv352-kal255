 - Yah! - Oh. Ah! I am Lord Festus. Ah! No rest for Tigtone as long as there quest in the world there be. I'll help, too, with my magical powers of regeneration. You've got that right, Helpy. Hee-yah! Whoa. Helpy, get ready to flip me into action. Zero... ...one, two...

 - The final piece. - ...three. At last, I found it... just like I found all the other pieces. Ah! Ow! What is that magical mishmash of shapes, Helpy? Remember all of our adventures? You, Tigtone, questing your dear heart out, and I helping. But I was also collecting shards of the legendary Jengas... My secret mission and true purpose all along. You were questing on your own the whole time you were my sidekick? Who do you think you are? - I'm Helpy. - Oh. And I serve the greater good. - Ah! - Helpy, what is happening?

 Nothing, Tigtone. Nothing is happening. Farewell, Tigtone. Well, I quested alone before I met Helpy, and I'll quest alone before I met Helpy again! Come, Helpy. Oh. Ah, yes, Propecia Castle. They always have quests. King/Queen, and what can I quest for you? I am eating the soft peaches. I'm guarding the soft-peach cart. - Guarding it from what? - Nothing. Ugh. Townsfolk, it is I, Tigtone. My quest lines are open. What silence is this? Perhaps the villain Festus needs thwarting. That's always a good quest. Lord Festus, I have come to stop whatever you're... doing. Nah. We're okay. This is madness! Oh, this is pleasant. I guess betraying Tigtone was a small price to pay to make everyone safe from everything. Well, not everyone is safe. I need one more small price to pay from you, Helpy. But I did what you asked. What more do you want? I need to absorb your body so that I can have your special regenerative power. Oh, crystal gods of the Starlix realm, please do something to end my quest-lessness! Tigtone, we heard your prayer. Why is nothing happening? Why can I not find a quest? A renegade god called "The Greater Good" has united the Jengas. Ah. This is starting to sound like a quest. The Greater Good has unleashed nothing across the realm. This sounds like a quest! Now, Tigtone, we give you your greatest quest. - Ah-ha! - Destroy nothing. Stop The Greater Good. Everything is at stake, Tigtone. Okaaay! Us-speed, Tigtone. All right, nothing. You asked for it. Draw! Stop! Of course. Command-Or Mathis, throw me a peach. Whoosh! My sword is too sharp to destroy nothing. I need a sword that cuts nothing. The sword that cuts nothing! Isn't this nice, Helpy? Yes. Nothing is its own reward. Ugh, Tigtone. Helpy, you traitor! You may have breached the walls of nothing with your clever sword, but you are too late. Don't you see, Tigtone? I am unscathable. And no one... Help! ...crystal god or non-crystal man, can stop me. I grow tired of your petty sculpting, and now, I must rest, now. Goodnight, Tigtone. Tigtone, helping everyone has made me realize that the one thing more important than everyone is you, Tigtone. What are you talking about, over there? - Nothing. - Oh. That pleases me. Goodnight, again. The Greater Good has betrayed me like I betrayed you. But let me help you one last time. You don't mean... No, Helpy, not that. Yes, Tigtone. You must use the magic words that only you know... The only ones that can kill me. Then, The Greater Good will be vulnerable. I... I understand. Say the magic words and kill me. Die... Helpy. Helpy! Thank you for all your help, old friend. As for you, Greater Good, you are good for nothing! Oh! Ah, death... the final nothing. We did it, Helpy. You and me, old pal. Thank you, Tigtone. You have done it. Everything is in balance, and everyone is praying to us again. For your reward, you receive one use of the all-powerful Jengas. You may either restore life to your beloved Helpy or sharpen your broken sword. Choose. - I... - Choose now. - Oh. Give me my Helpy. Tigtone. Tigtone, find my missing silver amulet! Hear that, Tigtone? Quests! Thank you, Tigtone. Everything is normally again. Yes, yes, back to normal. But once you experience killing a god, normal feels like nothing. Oh, I see what you mean, Tigtone. Helpy, are you thinking what I'm always thinking? Huh? Hey! Balance is for the weak! Normal is for the weak! The gods are weak! But I am no weak, for I am Tigtone! Which quest do you want to do first? All of them! Tigtone, find my missing golden amulet. Yes!
