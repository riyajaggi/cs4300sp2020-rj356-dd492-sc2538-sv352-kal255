 Gather 'round so I can tell you that tonight, right now, someone is killing campers, at this very Warrior Training... Camp! [ Both scream ] Oh. [ Laughing ] So none of you should be out here in the dark, especially at night. Now leave this campfire and go back through the dark woods to your tents. [ Insects chirping, animals calling ] Ah. Aw, come on, Gert.

 Well, okay, then I guess, okay? [ Smooching ] [ Branch snaps ]What was that? Oh, it's probably just a wind elemental. [ Smooching ] Aah! Oh, it's you. Aah! Ohh! - [ Gasps ] - Tigtone! I was looking for you all night. This is the last place I checked. I was having the most wondrous dream... Murder! There's been another murder! Two this time!

 Oh, will this murder case quest ever end? Helpy, what do these murders all have in common? That's right! Victims! Of course! Witnesses to their own death! We must journey to the netherworld to interview these victims! Too bad you have to miss tonight's warrior formal, Tigtone. You would have been crowned guest of honor again for sure. I have too many of those awful crowns already. I'll never need to attend a formal again. And I won't! Well, here we are at the cemetery ferry. Off to the world with you... The netherworld, that is. Hmm. With Tigtone out of the way, that guest-of-honor crown is as good as mine! Speaking of which, how's that sign coming, CJ? Uh, dance to... night. [ Laughs ] You know, I've never been to this dance. Or any dance. Tigtone, what is dance? We'll go to that dance over my dead body! That reminds me, will you take care of my dead body after I'm gone? Of course. But that's not going to be for a long, long time... Ahh. Wait. W-What... What was that?! I took a death potion, Helpy. Aah! Where did you get death potion?! My inventory. Goodbye, Helpy. Oh, good... Temporary death potion. And I better come back to find my corpse the way I left it! Aah! Ah! Welcome to... The Graveyard of the Deceased! ♪♪ I'm on a quest to solve murders at the Warrior Training Camp across the lake. I wish to speak to dead teenagers! ♪♪ "Heyah. Me Tigtone." Ha ha! That's kind of interesting. "Me visit ghosts. Helpy watch my dead body and not go dance." Wait! Tigtone, you said we could go to dance over your dead body. Did you really mean it? "I'm Tigtone. I mean everything." Well, then, we'd better get ready! [ Grunts ] [ Laughs ] Ah, yes. We had two new arrivals yesterday. Very sad and sexy. Those are the names of the bodies I saw! In you go then, yes! [ Grunts ] [ Laughing ] Yes! [ Evil laughter ] Come on, Gert. Well, okay, I guess, okay. [ Branch snaps ]What was that? It's probably just a wind elemental. Teen warriors! Oh, it's you. Aah! It was you! Aah! Tigtone the murderer! Those teens must be confused and useless! Perhaps you would care to speak to the other victims, yes? Spirits: Tigtone! Tigtone! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! No. No! Yes. Yes! Aha-ha-ha, yes! [ Grunts ] ♪♪ "Dear Journal! I certainly am Tigtone. Murder case I am to solve because me hero. Time for best friend Helpy to learn dance!" Ah, so you changed your mind about the Warrior Formal. That's just great. Where dance is? Here. Let me draw you a map on the back of my unfinished acceptance speech. Map? Yes, I know how to read map! - Murderer! Murderer! - Oh, no, no! You're all liars! Liars and ghosts! - Murderer! Perhaps you'll believe your eyes when you see your face through the eyes of your victims, yes?! [ Evil laugh ] [ Gasps ] Aah! [ Gasps ] Aah, no! [ Gasps ] Aah! Yes! Maps are usually your job, Tigtone. But you're dead. Oh, this must be dance! ♪♪ What kind of dance is this place? Cryptomb the serial killer? But Tigtone killed him years ago! [ Door slams in distance ] Ahh! I can't be summoned now, you moron! Dada, look at me! I'm Tigtone! No, you're not. I'm busy with the real Tigtone! I could kill Tigtone for Daddy. Kill Tigtone? You can barely kill teens! And I can't kill him because I am a weak ghost! [ Tigtone screams ] That was the whole point of this plan! [ Sobs ] I'mma go kill more teenagers now. No! You'll mess everything up![ Tigtone screaming ] Tigtone is about to snap, yes! Leave me alone! Aah! [ Grunts ] Tigtone?! [ Screams ] ♪♪ [ Grunts ] [ Screaming ] Oh. Is that what I'm like to be killed by me? It's horrifying! Yes, it must be quite a shock! But I wasn't even on a killing quest! Your temporary death potion is wearing off! What will you do when you return to the land of the living? To complete this murder case quest, I must turn myself in. [ Evil laugh ] Yes! Now goes Tigtone willingly to the gallows! And in death, he will be remembered as a disgrace. [ Laughs ] [ Grunts ] Aah! Aah! [ Gasps ] Oh, no. I've done it again. [ Laughs ] Dada! Aah! Junior? My son! What about the plan? I lost it. No, Tigtone, you don't understand. I understand all too well. It was me the whole time. Quest closed! Stop, Tigtone! Oh, this will be my last quest. Stop! The Last Quest of Tigtone, they'll call it. Tigtone! Or Tigtone's Last Quest, maybe. Tigtone and the Last Quest... [ Sniffles ] Tigtone... [ Door opens, slams shut ] You've let those young warriors down, Tigtone. Now who will they look up to? Me? Will they crown me the guest of honor? Most likely, but I never wanted it like this. [ Door slams shut ] [ Nose tightens ] Gaah! Stop! Another Tigtone? No! It's me... Helpy! Tigtone isn't the murderer! CJ the groundskeeper committed the murders while wearing this Tigtone mask to frame him! Ha! Of course! But why? CJ is Cryptomb's son! C-J... Cryptomb the Second! Cryptomb was working with CJ from beyond the grave you sent him to! Revenge is a dish best served... Tig-tone! Aah! Daddy love little Junior! No, Daddy does not! Gaah! No! Aah! No! How is this even possible? Anything is possible when you believe in yourself! Hyah! [ Both straining ] Dad! Look what I can do! Dad! Look! Hanging for all eternity with my dim torch of a son?! N-o-o-o-o-o! I'm the best one here! I'm so close to getting that guest-of-honor crown, I can taste it on my head. Helpy, what's wrong? Oh, nothing. Well, then I guess this second temporary death potion is going to go to waste. Do you really mean it? Over my dead body. Yes, yes, yes. Tigtone! [ Chanting "Tigtone!" ] [ Sighs ] Dear Journal. Wait. Someone's been writing in you. What's this nonsense? "I certainly am Tigtone. Murder case I am to solve because me hero! Time for best friend Helpy to learn dance!" Helpy! [ Cheers and applause ] [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] Daddy, look! Ahaha! [ Sighs ] Look, Dad, look! [ Laughs ] [ Groans ] Dad! Dad, dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! [ Laughs ] Aah! No!
