 [ Villagers crying, moaning ] [ Man whimpering ]Hmm. King: Command-Or Mathis, where's that wine? Wine! Wine, wine, wine, wine! I need wine. Wine time! Quit your wailing! Command-Or Mathis, do bring us wine. I'll use my Command-Or strength to check the wine cellar. [ Grunts ] Empty! To the roof!

 Barteener, wine for me and my Helpy. I've got some dry news for you, Tigtone. I'll use my perfect Command-Or vision to check the local wine-yard. Even emptier? Propicia's wine-yards have been scooped out of the ground. They've been stolen! Wine, wine, wine, wine, wine, wine, wine! Mathis! Wine! It's all gone! What?! What?! Aaaaaaaah! Now there's a massive wine famine! [ Gasps ]

 Aaaaaaaah! ♪♪ Tigtone, we task you with restoring wine once more. Task and you shall receive. And, Tigtone, hurry! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Please, my son, he needs wine. Do not be afraid, wineless babe, for we are all sons of death in the eyes of the crystal gods in the Starlich's realm. Father, I'm so sober. Ugh! Wine, wine... I need wine! Helpy. Yes? Before I die, I just want you to know that... You know you can tell me anything. ...that there's a wine-yard right over there. Oh, me too, Tigtone. Me too. No. [ Grunting ] [ Both gulping ] [ Laughing ] I love wine. [ Snoring ] Tigtone! Tigtone! Aah! What's happening? Even worse... Sky Wine Pirates! [ Grunts ] No one steals my wine and lives to tell the tale of how they stole my wine. [ Both grunting ] We need disguises. Pirate ones. [ Both scream ] You there, the crew is drunk and sky sick. Get below and clean up. I accept your quest! Fellow pirate. Argh! [ Both laugh ] [ Men vomiting ] I have completed your quest! Great job! You sure do work fast. Ha ha, fool! It is I, Tigtone, the legendary adventurer! I knew it! That's right. Ha ha! Fool to you! For I am the legendary pirate queen and captain of this ship, Zuviell. Zuviell, the sky-wine pirate queen captain, I should have known. So should I. Hyah! [ Swords clanging ] [ Both laugh ] Oh, I miss wine so much. Woe is me! Oh, remember that time I had three sips at once? Ahh. Prince Lavender, m-my son, are you drinking wine? Hmm? What's that? No! Of course not. Liar! Mathis, get us that wine. No. You shan't have it. You shan't! I'm afraid that I cannot help, for lack of wine has blinded my sight! [ All gasp ] [ Moans ] Wine! Mathis, help! No, Mathis, help me! Surely my other Command-Or senses have compensated for my lack of sight. Hyah! Aaaaaaaah! Yes! [ Swords clanging ] Ha ha! While we were busy fighting, I said, "I'm here to take back the stolen wine." Oh! Never! [ Both grunting ] Ho-ho! Ha ha! You'll never get this wine. What else would we drink, water? [ Pirates cheering ] Milk? No! Blood?[ Pirates shout ] Why would we prefer blood to this delicious wine? - Wine! - Yeah! Wine! Now walk the plank, or we'll shoot you off with a cannonball. Very well. Remember, Tigtone, you can steercannonballs! That remembers me an idea. Aah! [ Screaming ] Yaaah! [ Laughs ] Land cowards, come back here! Aaah! - Ha ha! - Ha ha! [ Chuckles ] Here we are. [ Crashing ] Blassamangengurooooo! What in carnation? Why do you summon me, Blassamangenguro? Oh, ancient flower vampire, I have come to call upon your services. I will bite anything for a price. Then name your price! Anything! What do you say to this acorn? I accept. Shh. Ohh! Eee! Hush now, little creature, hush. [ Helpy whimpers ] [ Helpy groaning ] Aah! Oh, what have I done to deserve such wineless treatment? [ Both sobbing ] That's it! You want wine so badly, then let's go and get you some. Command-Or Mathis, bring around the Battle Buggy. But I am blind! [ All screaming ] [ Crashing ] [ Screaming ] No, no, no! Here's your wine! Is this what you wanted? No, no, no! Suck on your dirt wine! No, not like this! I don't want it like this! Have the dirt wine. [ Laughing ] I can't believe you think it's okay to violate me like this. Helpy, I act on what I think is best. [ Moans ] [ Crashing ] Tigtone: Be quiet! We don't want to wake them. Go now and feast! Yaah-ha-ha-ha! ♪♪ [ Hisses ] Aah, aah! [ Choking ] [ Grunts ] ♪♪ Ugh! [ Grunting ] Aah! [ Screams ] [ Hisses ] And now we wait. [ Hissing, groaning ] Monsters! What have ye done to us? Me thirst for wine is all gone! Try this! [ Hisses ] Blood? [ Slurps ] Ahh! Well, I'm convinced. Listen up! Return the wine-yards, for we are now Sky BloodPirates! Someone change the flag! Look! The wine is back! [ Groaning, whimpering ] And so the wine famine is over, thanks to all involved. Ahh! Ahh! Whoo-hoo-hoo! My Command-Or vision, slowly Command-Or returning! And we have learned that wine is thicker than blood. A lesson we should all take to heart. [ Hisses ] Why, hello there, good-looking. Why, hello there, yourself. I was talking about your bloody leg. So was I. Helpy, do you think if I stabbed you with a wooden stake, you'd regenerate back to normal? I'm not sure, Tigtone, but thanks for running it by me before you... Aah! [ Bones clattering ] Aaaaaah! I would like some wine, please. [ Corks popping ] - Whoo-hoo! - Yes! [ Laughter, cheering ] Yee-haw! Whoo! ♪♪ [ Hissing ] Whoa! [ Sky vampires hissing ] ♪♪ Now this is a party! [ Both laugh ]
