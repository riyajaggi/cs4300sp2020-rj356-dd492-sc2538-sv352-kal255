 What a great day to be tortured by me, Lord Festus! Eh, Marwin? Ah! Marwin! That beautiful rain is turnin' my ugly kingdom pretty! It's hideous! There's only one man who can help me now... My sworn enemy, Tigtone. Dear Journal, I... Hey, handsome, how did you get so handsome?

 Dear Journal! He's so handsome, he can't even hear me. Too handsome for hearing, are we? Tigtone, it's Lord Festus' head. My magically projected head! Lord Festus. What do you want, you slimy sadist? All of my fists! Where do you want it? - In your face! - Well, now, Tigtone. Now, I know we've had our differences in the past... Gahhhh! Gahhhh! Gahhhh! Yep, three good times.

 Anyway, I need your help. Like help you do, - right, Tigtone? - That's right, Helpy. But, Tigtone, I got a quest for you at Camphor Tower. You just have to come and get it. Could this be a trap? Do you really think we should trust Lord Festus? A que-e-e-e-e-e-e-st! Ah, Tigtone. There you are. He's right. We can trust him. I love what you've done with the place, Festus. I don't, and I didn't. Oh, please, Tigtone. This beauty rain is destroying my ugly land. You got to find out what's going on up in them dang clouds. Why should I quest for you? Yeah. You villain. Uh, if you don't, I'll destroy the world or somethin'. I don't know. I haven't had time to think it through. Oh, no. Tigtone, the world is at stake! The world is at stake? Then I, Tigtone, shall accept this ugly quest! Also, accept this viewing orb. It's a talkin' orb, too, so I can talk at you. I got one just like it. Now get out of here! So, what's our plan, Tigtone? Hup! Hup! Hmm. If only we were better at jumping. Wait! Are you better - at jumping, Helpy? - No. Oh, my. It's beautiful. Wings! Helpy, regenerate these beautiful wings into your body. Aah! It doesn't work like that. Oh, I guess it does work like that. Now, fly like you've never flown before! I haven't! Ohh! Oh, my God! I can't feel my legs. Are my legs broken, mister? I think my legs are broken. Are they okay? So... So cold. Everything's getting dark. You're going to be fine. B-Before I go, just... let me know how are my legs looking? Huh? Whoa! Tigtone, where does death come from? Well, Helpy, when two creatures hate each other very much... Festus to Tigtone. Festus to Tigtone! Lord Festus! It's gettin' awful pretty down here. What's going on up there? The beauty rain is actually the beauty blood of these creatures who are beautifully slaughtering each other. Yep, that's what I figured. You got to stop this war, Tigtone! Stop fighting! What manner of ugly beast are you? Answer it, Helpy. Not you, most attractive one. You! Surely you're an ally of the Sky Unicorns, our ugly enemies! Him? A Sky Unicorn? He's as hideous as you are, vile Horned Pegasus. We Horned Pegasuses are the most attractive creatures in all the Sky Realm. The creatures all look exactly alike. I'll kill you all! Everyone, calm down! Tigtone is my friend. And besides, he's beautiful on the inside. - Beautiful? - Inside? - Interior beauty. - How? We must possess this inside beauty! - Cut him open! - Get him! They vanished. Those beautiful creatures are insane! That's correct, strangers. But it wasn't always like this, Tigtone. Ages ago, we were all of one type of creature... The peaceful and ugly type. But a magic spell was discovered that gave my people wings and horns and made them beautiful. Then they broke into factions and began arguing over who was the most beautiful. Now their animosity has boiled over into all-out beautiful war. And that's me, Zlotovf. None of your information helps me! Break off their horns. Rip out their wings. Return them to their original forms. Only that will stop this beautiful war. Tigtone! Stoppin' the beautiful bloodshed won't re-uglify Camphor, and that is what I want. - Hey, what's that? - Oh, that's a picture of me. Yes, that's my name, Zlotovf. No, above that. Oh, that's the ugly realm above us. I included it for detail. So you're sayin' there's a whole realm full of ugly above y'alls? Yes, it's sickening. Of course! If beautiful blood turns things pretty, then ugly blood must turn things that! We're going to need a lot of ugly blood. Use my empty buckets. To the ugly realm! Welcome, strangers. Is there anything you'd like to talk about? I'm sorry, but I need all the blood of your entire ugly civilization. Ugly? Us? - Are you sure? - Oh, yeah, very ugly. As I was saying and doing and apologizing for... - Ugly? - Ugly? It's working! These ugly tears are even better than ugly blood. This gives me another idea! Just look at yourselves. Nobody loves you because of how you look. Your stores are full of ugly customers. I feel ugly just talking to you. - Vile. - Gross. - Icky. - Putrid. - Gunky. - Bad lookin'. Ug-g-g-g-l-l-ly. I'm ugly and don't feel like murdering anyone anymore. Let's just live in hideous peace. - Just a little more. - Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly! Perfect. How do we get them to stop crying? Tigtone? Ugly creatures, behold! Doesn't this make you feel better... A creature even more disgusting than you? Huh? The suffering of that creature has made us happy once again. Our work here is done, Helpy. Let us leave them in peace! I'm okay... and back to my normal level of beauty... Medium! Well, everything's back to normal, Tigtone. Maybe even a little uglier. Including our partnership, Lord Festus. Yeah, I suppose to got to go back to the way we used to be, huh? Then the next time we meet, my success may lie in your demise. Tigtone, have you learned a lesson from all of this? Maybe it's better to be ugly on the outside as well as on the inside. Well, you better write it down before you forget. Forget what, Helpy? Forget what? My plan worked! That's right. I had a plan all along. I am now the most beautiful. Bow to me, your new ruler, Zlotovf! It's going to be a lot of responsibility, but I'm ready for it. What else do rulers do, I wonder? I should do all of it. Somebody's got to do it. Bow to me, you dribbling sponge horns!
