A coupIe of months ago we found ammunition in his car. Yes? Yeah. We were sure we couId prove it came from Peacock. Aye' but it didnae work. Not this time. Why did Hartman have a gun? And where did he get it from? It's a drug deaIer's gun. Who do we know that fixes them up? Peacock got off this morning by cIaiming you harassed him. Harass him some more. Another one before you go? - I want to be in earIy. Pick you up? - No' it's fine. Don't stay too Iate. (LAUGHTER) So she pops it back in again. And her eyes get bigger... and bigger. And when she takes it out this time' it says... Heart of MidIothian. CeIebrating' eh? With your boys spending the first night in the jaiI. - Won't you join us' Mr Rebus? - I wiII. Good evening. I am John. Are you drunk? Not very. These are aII my friends' coIIeagues. Who remembers names? Oh-ho' I do. Lay up another pIace' Marco. We've aIready ordered. - You go ahead. - I'm fine. That's what I'm after. - There you go' sir. - Thank you' Marco. - You're weIcome. - SIainte. Extraordinary thing. I was just taIking about you tonight. Good things' I hope. The shooting at the schooI. Three Iads shot' two of them kiIIed. Shot with an untraceabIe gun. That's what made me think of you. Ladies and gents' I give you... the Peacock. What did the judge say' Mr Rebus? I have been subject to a campaign by Lothian and Borders CID disproportionate to the evidence presented. You're embarrassing yourseIf. One of those boys was my bIood. Next' pIease. It's your turn' Iove. Scoobs? Scooby? Scooby? Come on' mate. (KNOCK AT DOOR) You bastard! What do you want?! (REBUS ) A wee chat. Open this. I'II deaI with it. I was going to teII you about Fairstone. I knew something was up. You'II get him. Not tiII he beats someone eIse to a puIp. WeII' make sure it isn't you. What about TempIer? What wiII you say to her? Just that. It was my cousin's wee boy that was kiIIed. I'II resign because I can't remain objective. Never bothered you before. No' you're right. I'II do it first up in the morning. It's that now. Do you want to stay? There's a bed made up. Ah. WeII' in that case' no. Was that what you wanted to chat about? It's not my case any more. I'm sorry about Scooby. He was a cooI cat. Not funny! ReaIIy not funny! (DOOR CLOSES ) I need a whisky before bed' Dougie. - So you do sIeep' Mr Rebus? - Ah. Marty' how are you doing? Can I get you a drink? - I'm not so bad' Mr Rebus. - Whatever he's having. - I thought you'd be ceIebrating. - Oh' aye. Youse Iot never got us' eh? Give us time' Marty. Give us time. Hear about the shooting up at the schooI? Aye. It was a bad one. Cheers' Mr Rebus. No' there' son. You pish in your own doorway. - You got a Iight? - Uh-huh. I thought Peacock was a wanker. (REBUS ) # He's a wanker ♪ He's a wanker... ♪ - He's not. He's aII right. - # He's a wanker.... # Now smarten yourseIf up now. Come on. That's better. - Now you said you had the good bottIe. - I dae! Come on' then! (MIAOW) Oh' nice cat. What's his name? How is he? Not good. How are you? - You want one? - Ah' yeah' pIease. How is it? No pain now? Good. Anything eIse you want? Are you comfy? No' no' it's OK. I'm not going anywhere. This is a friend. He's a poIiceman. He's been up at the schooI. HeIIo. I'm John. I saw you getting carried out. Can you remember anything about yesterday? Did you see Derek and Tony getting shot? Before you? And Lee? Did you see what happened to Lee? That's enough. Ssh' ssh' ssh. - OK' OK. - You'II hurt yourseIf. Nurse! Ssh' ssh' ssh. I'II onIy be a moment. You're aII right now. Take big breaths' OK? WeII done. - I need to taIk to him. - He's not ready. I know. You Iive 20 minutes from the schooI. He's boarding. My job takes me away. After his mum died' I didn't cope too weII. He got on better at schooI than with me. - I thought if he was boarding... - Hartman taught him to saiI? Yeah. Didn't know he was a bIoody psycho. (REBUS ) Don't make assumptions. Look at aII the evidence. Why was Hartman running? Was he being chased or was he chasing somebody eIse? He was fit. - He was a PT instructor. - Maybe he ran to psych himseIf up. How weII did he know the victims? To James BeII he was a bit of a hero. What about the other two? AIso' Jez Peacock. Aye' wouIdn't you know? It's just possibIe the ammunition and gun came from him. What part did he pIay? Last up... Why shots to the head? It's a difficuIt target' but he went for it. He was in the Army' SpeciaI Forces. He knew how to use a gun. A trained assassin wiII take somebody down with a body shot' then... ..finish them off. The gun jammed or misfired. He didn't get Jarvies with the first shot. He didn't even kiII James BeII. - Be thankfuI for that. - It was a mess! - James BeII is the onIy survivor... - I thank John for the Iast 24 hours. It hasn't been easy. And for him' personaIIy' very difficuIt indeed. I am taking over this investigation. A word. What was that? I don't enjoy being embarrassed. - Of course not. - You were to teII them you were off it. They're too sure about what happened. Just because it's your nephew got kiIIed' doesn't mean they're wrong. Point taken. You're the poIitician now. You watch your judgment. Ask the right questions' not the easy ones. Fuck off. Go on' Ieave it. I'II keep them up to it. Better? Look what I got. You won't be hearing from him again. Can you do a DNA for me? DS CIarke. In exchange for a chicken jaIfrezi' a coId Iager and severaI chapatis. Have you taIked to anyone about this? You. - I'm fIattered. - Don't be. Can you run it? Any cIues who it's from? - A shit caIIed Fairstone. - ReaIIy? We just coIIected a Marty Fairstone. He's in a tub back there. Died in a fire earIy this morning. I'II run it. Thank you. They're Iike crows.You want a drink? Aye. I've resigned the case. Aye? Why did you do that' then? Because of you and me being cousins. ConfIict of interest. Aye' weII' I suppose you know best. Cheers. Been a Iong time. - You stiII a Hibee? - Oh' for sure. Hey' you gave me a footbaII. - Oh' Jeezo. When? - About 1 975. I was nine. One of they bIack and white ones that the whoIe team signs. Aye' my mam said you were a soIdier' but you never came in any kind of uniform so I reckoned you for a Iiar. - I was a soIdier. - Now you're a copper. - (ELECTRONIC NOISE) - What is that? It's Derek's. It's his computer. It just... It keeps doing that. Must be an emaiI or something. Kate'II stop it. - Do you want me to? - Can you? Aye. Aye' just go in. Go right in. Is it tidy? - Aye' it is. - Aye' he aIways keeps it tidy. Who's the gi...? Hiya. - I came by. I thought you wouIdn't mind. - For sure. Let me give you a hand. Hi' Dad. - Do you mind if I ask about Derek? - No. Did you get on? Yeah. Not aII the time' but yeah. When Mum Ieft' we stopped fighting so much. - (ALAN) Aye' mostIy you do. - MostIy we did. Did he have a girIfriend? Don't think so' no. So who's the girI on the Iaptop? That's Teri Cotter. She's a right tart. He took her out once' but she was Ieading him on. Excuse me. (GENTLE SNORING) Look' don't go. This is the first time he's sIept since... It's cos you're here. (SIOBHAN) Post mortem reckons 1 .30. So pretty much this time yesterday. The bodies were Hartman here' here Renshaw' and Jarvies. - And Jamie BeII was... - I know. I just wanted to remind myseIf. Do you know what Rebus thought? No. I think he just wanted to see it' not to judge it. Was it sunny yesterday? Aye. I think so. Enough? Oh' yes. Why does he have to make it so compIicated? It's obvious what happened. They want us out and the room cIeaned up. They'II Iock it and Iose the key. (TEMPLER) Best thing. - (PHONE RINGS ) - He didn't suffer. - It was quick. - HeIIo? - Do you have any fags? - The poIice want to taIk to you. - I'm fresh out. - Dad' you don't smoke! I wouId just Iike one. TeII them to caII back tomorrow. Can you caII tomorrow? - If you couId speak to James BeII... - Look' can you just Ieave it?! It's over and it's done wi' and... PIease. Leave it. I'II nip out and get some fags. For me' just for me. I'II just be five minutes. Mr BeII? Some peopIe here to see you. Yeah. Mr BeII? DS CIarke. And this is DCS TempIer. We heard James is conscious. - He's sIeeping. - No' that's fine. We can come back. - When do you think can he taIk to us? - He can't speak. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? Some freaked-out storm trooper gets into the schooI and shoots my son... That isn't enough. No' it isn't. Listen. We'II keep in touch with the hospitaI. Thank you. Shite! Look' there was something eIse. - Yes? - I was awake aII night. - Sorry to... - No' that's... I remembered something. The gunman' Hartman. I know bits about him. He taIked to James a Iot. He had a good mate sent to prison recentIy. - And? - I checked back in my paper's archives. He fIipped out' too. Murdered his wife. Hey! Hey' Teri! Oh' shite! - Can I ask you...? - You a perv? - How come you're everywhere I go? - Leave me aIone. - (PHONE RINGS ) - What's your picture doing at Derek's? - Doing what? - Siobhan... - That's sick. - Can I buy you a coffee? - No! - Just five minutes. Five minutes. How come you saw my picture anyway? His dad's my cousin. - Derek Renshaw is a creep. - He's a creep? And Iast night? - Peacock... - You wrecked my dress! Look! - Cost a fortune! - Easy' big yin. - You reaIIy wound him up. - Uh-huh. - What happened after I Ieft? - Nothing I'd teII you. You want one? Or do you just Iike to watch? - What did you do? - Went driving. - In Peacock's car? AII night? - They drive him and he sIeeps. He's Iike a baby. Can't sIeep in a bed. - So you sIept? - What's it to you? I'm a poIiceman. Jeez! I'm not teIIing you anything. - You with them up at the coIIege? - Uh-huh. ''Uh-huh''(!) What happened in that room? I'm not teIIing you. - Did you know the boys that were shot? - Aye. I did. LittIe James. He's cooI. He's my mate. - Is he going to be OK? - It'II take some time. - I'II go and see him. - And Derek you knew? CertainIy did. Hated him' and Tony. AIways...Iooking at me. - Why were you at the dinner? - Peacock invited me. He's a friend of a friend. Mr Hartman? - He is dead' isn't he? - Aye. I've got to go. If that's OK(?) Wait. For your taxi. Marty Fairstone died in a fire Iast night. - At Ieast they think it's him. - No great Ioss. - Is that what you came to teII me? - No. There's a man in Carbrae Psychiatric Unit. Robert NiIes. He knew Hartman. Last year he fIipped out' murdered his wife with a pair of scissors. Hartman's mate? From the regiment. - The regiment? - SAS. Your Iot. Ah. - You know aII that stuff. - Aye' I do. NiIes and Hartman went through a Iot together. Caucasus' Afghanistan' Iraq. He said when he kiIIed his wife he knew exactIy what he was doing. (SIOBHAN) NiIes has had a visitor. Uh-huh. ''T WoIf'. NiIes doesn't know Hartman's dead. Now that he's had a visitor' maybe he does. DS CIarke' DI Rebus. Mr NiIes has agreed to see you voIuntariIy. For your own safety' I advise you not to go beyond these chairs. I want to ask you some questions about Lee Hartman. You served with him in SpeciaI Forces. Lee's in a bit of troubIe. We think you can heIp us. Was he the kind of man to freak out? To Iose it? - Last time you saw Lee... - How Iong's he been dead? - 24 hours. - Yeah. Ever think you're back in? I get dreams I'm back on Exmoor. - Were you in the regiment? - I tried' but I bIew it. - How? - Wasn't hard enough. - Lost your bottIe? - WhoIe bIoody brewery. - What do you dae aboot the dreams? - Avoid sIeeping. There's nae booze in here. Is that what you dae? Aye. - Did Lee find it difficuIt to... - Adjust? No' so much. He couId aIways find his way back every time. Took me wi' him. What did Mr WoIf want to know? Nothing. - He didn't teII you anything or... - Shut up! What was Lee's skiIIs? Guns. CouId make anything shoot' hit anything with it. WeII' we think he... kiIIed three boys. And then kiIIed himseIf. Did he ever taIk to you about wanting to kiII anyone? I mean' do you think that... ..he couId have done such a terribIe thing to' eh... ..defenceIess kids? This is boIIocks. One Iast question. Why did you kiII your wife? Come on' Bobby! Get off him! - So' what did you get from that? - A skeIping. - You deserved it. - Aye. He knew what he was doing. He certainIy did. He's been trained to do nothing without a reason. If he can't find a purpose or cope with it' it gets removed. His wife? NormaI Iife' Iove' taxes. You think it's not his fauIt? Not at aII. He's insane. Hartman was trained in exactIy the same way. The shooting was a mess. Hartman was in tears. It doesn't fit. - You're after monsters. There are none. - AIways. - AIways. - That's why they're aII scared of you. They think you were in the SAS' but you weren't. No. Let me off here. They're aIready gathering for the vigiI. - You OK? - Yeah. - Facts or gossip? - Facts. Your note was written by Marty Fairstone. You owe me. - Gossip? - Rebus is in the shit. What do you mean? - It's a good turn out. - Aye. There's stiII good peopIe. - You been scrapping? - Something Iike that. - What? - Dad. Dad' come on. HeIIo. I thought you were coming back. Eh' I'm sorry... We'II see you up there. - I fight my own battIes. - Siobhan. Marty Fairstone. You went to his pIace. - Do me a favour. - You've enough of your own shit. As soon as I get inside' caII that number. - What? - Ask for Mr WoIf. Don't know his room. - What do I say to him? - Nothing. He won't be there. Evening' Strathmount HoteI reception. Gerri speaking. I'II try his room for you' madam. I'm sorry' there's no answer. Do you want his voicemaiI? ..Good night. Sir? I've Iost the wee key card thingy. - Room number? - 204. - Mister? - WoIf. T WoIf. - I'm expecting a caII from my wife. - Here you are. - I think you just missed her' sir. - Aw' damn. Evening. Strathmount HoteI reception. Gerri speaking. So what were you doing there with him? We enjoy the same pint. - It was just a coincidence? - Uh-huh. - Did you set fire to his fIat? - Don't be ridicuIous. - This way. - How is that ridicuIous? You were angry about the boys. You had the time' opportunity and motive. - And you were drunk. So stupid! - It's WoIf we shouId be thinking about. - You're not running this! - He got to NiIes before we did. Why did you go Iooking for Marty? Was it just about me? He unpacked. He's obviousIy staying for a few days. Shut the door. This is not your case any more. For good reason. Your judgment is... Ah! FiIes. Army personneI fiIes. Robert NiIes. Lee Hartman. Good grief. Who are aII these others? He didn't need to ask NiIes anything. Just remind him of his duty. - I'm not staying here. - I'II caII you. (KEYS JANGLE) (PHONE RINGS ) Yep? Who? How did she know I was...? OK. That wouId be very pIeasant. Sure' I'II be... Yeah. Right away. Sergeant CIarke. Siobhan. How IoveIy. - Mr WoIf? - How come everybody knows me? She Ieft this. (PIPER PLAYS LAMENT) How are you? That day' back in '75. - Em' you know' I don't remember. - You Ieft me aIone in the park. I was nine. You and your mates went off to the pub. I'd to make my own way home. Some kids nicked the baII. You fucked off then. You fucked off this morning. And you can fuck off now. Get off me! Leave me aIone! - Hey! I thought we had a date. - This has got nothing to do with you. Maybe it does' son. - Teri! - You're not safe. Hey! You need a Iift? What is it with everyone? Just Ieave me be! It's OK. We'II get together some other time' eh? - What are you on? - Did you see a fire Iast night? Just...bog off! Do you know Marty? You must have seen him around. A junkie. Did errands for Peacock. WeII' him and me spent some time in each other's company Iast night. And then the next thing you know' whoof' Marty's toast. He's a one' that Peacock. Even made it out to Iook Iike me. His probIem is... ..you know it was him. Ah' you'II be fine. He Iikes you. It's obvious. Wait! 24 hours in advance. Cash. And a tenner deposit for the toweIs. - What do you do that oId man for? - I don't do him! - He's the meanest guy in Edinburgh. - I don't do him! - What does he want' then? - Company! - Aw' come on. He's nearIy 60. - I give him a wank! I don't...Iike it. Lee feIt Iike he owed him something. Peacock sort of brought him up. Is that what you think? Is that how you know him? Uh-huh. Did you see the fire? Yeah. A big whoosh. And breaking gIass. And they aII came running out. Peacock was aII excited. What about you and Lee? I've got something to show you. That's Rebus with Marty Fairstone an hour before he died. He's not answering his phone. He's out of controI. Bring him in. Find him. (PHONE RINGS ) - Where are you? - Do me a favour. - You've got to come in. - Arrest Peacock. - She's going crazy as it is. - Arrest him. - What for? - For Fairstone's murder. - I Iike my job. I don't want to Iose it. - You won't. Major WoIf. Next time put stuff back the way you found it. Stripy jim-jams' eh? - So what did you Iearn from NiIes? - You're the Ioss adjuster. You want to know if Hartman kiIIed those chiIdren. CarefuI. You're not even on this case. And if he did' you want to know who's to bIame' yeah? TempIer wants to taIk to you. You Iook awfuI. - Peacock? - In a ceII. TempIer's gone mad. - I reckon you've about an hour. - Sergeant CIarke? I owe you a drink. So? Derek Renshaw...was here. He was shot from over there' somewhere aIong this Iine. The gun was angIed down' but Iow. Anthony Jarvies was five-eight. The buIIet goes through his head and through the window. Again' the gun was Iow. He took two shots. The cyIinder jammed. Hartman was six-one. This is not a comfortabIe shooting height for him. - The sun wouId be fuII in his face. - Someone eIse? - Shorter? - There's no trace of anyone eIse. Hartman was shot through the chin. There are powder burns and cordite residue on his hands. - His fingerprints are on the gun. - He was crying. - And the other Iad? - James BeII. His bIood's somewhere up there. - A fine spray' but apparentIy it's there. - He was shot through the mouth? The buIIet took a piece of the occipitaI. So if the bIood is up there... ..he was shot... ..by me. By the time you're there' you're dead. Any residue on James's hands? Yes. Both. ''Assumed hands raised to shieId himseIf and picks up cordite residue.'' Or not. That's why Hartman was running! He wanted to stop it! - 91 . - Teri? 92. - TeII me about James BeII. - 93. 94. - What about him? - How come he's your mate? We Iearned to saiI together in the summer. - With Lee Hartman? - 97. I said' with Lee Hartman? Yeah. 98. - Who eIse? - Just the three of us. - You' James BeII and Lee Hartman? - Jeezo' yes! Lee didn't shoot those boys' did he? He didn't shoot himseIf. - And he didn't shoot James. - No. He wasn't mad' was he? And they were just boys. To bIow it aII for them? I don't think so. I Ioved him. And...he Ioved me. WeII...he said he did. I wanted to run away. But he said' ''Wait. And we'II waIk away.'' - Did Lee have a gun? - I don't know. Did he? Sometimes. He mended them for Peacock. When we went right out to sea' we'd shoot at tin cans. - Was James unhappy? - Of course! His mum had died and his dad didn't want him around. He Ioved the boat. We were sort of...famiIy. It was the best summer. He didn't wear shoes for a month. But then the boys came and wrecked it. - The dead boys. - Derek found us and he brought Tony. They got into weed and boozing. It was shit. What did Lee do? Not much. When he wasn't around' they buIIied James something awfuI. He hated them. Hiya. - You can't taIk' can you? - No' he can't. Are you Teri? You can do this. Derek and Tony are dead. And Mr Hartman. Did you know? I'm gonna teII you a secret. (I'm gonna have a baby.) It's true. And...it's Lee's. Did you take Hartman's gun? James' did you take the gun and shoot the boys? - What have you done?! - Get out! Out! - Out! You couId kiII him! - Good! Listen' Jack. He shot those boys and he shot Hartman and himseIf. - You're insane! - Maybe he was just trying to cover up. - You're crazy! - Listen...to me. He was miserabIe' he was unhappy. He bIamed you. - That's crap! - He bIamed his mum' Hartman' her. God knows! I don't know. Maybe he hated Wednesdays. I don't know. But he did it' Jack. He did. Go in there and ask him.
