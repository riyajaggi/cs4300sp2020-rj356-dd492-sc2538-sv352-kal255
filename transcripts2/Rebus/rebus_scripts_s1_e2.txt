 Rebus (2000–2004): Season 1, Episode 2 - The Hanging Garden - full transcript 
 A pharmaceutical factory appears to be the major supply source of cocaine over which a gun battle is being planned by the upstart gang leader and his group of thugs. Rebus' old friend and workmate, DI Jack Morton is on an undercover assignment at the drugs plant when the attack is made, and he receives fatal gunshot wounds. Another victim of these criminals is a young mother, Candice, who was kidnapped from Cosovo to work as a prostitute, and time is of the essence if Rebus going to help her see her young son again. Sammy, Rebus' 19-year-old daughter, provides a safe-house for Candice. Then shortly after the young refugee moves in, Sammy becomes the victim of a hit-and-run accident and is in a coma in hospital. Her father is convinced that she was a deliberate target because of his efforts to keep Candice safe and bring down the two gangs. Rebus and his ex-wife spell each other keeping watch over Sammy at the hospital. This story line offers the viewer better insight into Rebus as a man and father, and the softer side of the tough crime-fighting police officer.

 'When the sun goes down, and the moon comes up, 'that's when we go to the park - 'me, and Loopy, and Little Gee. 'Softly down the staircase, through the haunty hall, 'trying to look small - 'me, and Loopy, and Little Gee. 'We three.' Bye, now. Good night. Right. I'll walk you back. Don't be daft. It's the wrong direction.

 Besides, I might not go back. I might find a party. Oh? Where? I don't know. I've got my mobile. God, I'm feeling old. You are old. You're going grey. I am not. You are so. Ow, you bugger. I'm not grey. Thanks for the coat, Dad... and the hat. Bye, Dad. Keep the hat on. The Edinburgh winds will knock you over. 'And Little Gee doesn't like it.'

 'with Loopy and me.' Have you not got a home to go to, Rebus? What's happening? Bugger all. Telford's been on the arcade games. Fascinating. Softly, softly, catchy monkey. What? Nothing. How'd your chat with Cafferty go? Yeah, fine. Yeah? Touchy, knows Telford's cash rich - money laundering, European connections. Cafferty told you that? In as many words. Uh-oh. Uh! Oh, for pity's sake. Get after them! Uh, help me. Help me. Please, help me. Come here. Let's have a look. You'll be OK. Just keep your hand there. Get an ambulance. Come on. Don't stand there! We don't know him. I didn't ask that. Get an ambulance. The magic word? Keep your hand there. Keep the pressure on. Help me, please. I thought you took care of your lads, Tommy. (GASPS) We lost them. Stay with him. See if he talks. Ask when we can talk to him. OK. I'm going to have a wash. The guy's name is Danny Simpson. It's the best I could do. Ah, I hate hospitals. I could do with a drink. Ta. Ah. Are you not having one? No. I'm on the wagon. Science-fiction? Yeah, is that a problem? No. Hit and run. She's stable. We're trying to find her family. There's no ID. Er, excuse me. What's happening with Danny Simpson? We're getting him ready for theatre. You'll not get a word from him tonight. Just a chat. It's all I need. A name This could turn into a murder inquiry. I'll see what's possible. Thanks very much. I know you're busy and have other patients. I know her. It's my daughter. It's my daughter... Sammy. 'My daughter was in intensive care, 'and I knew it was my fault. 'It all began a month before. 'I was over the moon when Sammy got a place at Edinburgh, 'and returned to Scotland. 'I took a fortnight, nearly three weeks off. 'So I could get to know her all over again. 'It was the best time of my life. 'Well... 'excluding the Stones at Knebworth, 1988. 'But then I was called back to work. 'The victim's name was David Rutman. 'I knew him. 'He was a street dealer when he was 15, 16. 'He worked for the Cafferty organisation. 'He was robbed after being shot. 'We think there may have been drugs money in the bag that was stolen.' We're pretty sure Telford's behind this. Thomas Telford. Do you know him? The reputation. Yeah. Four years ago, he was a teenage tearaway, now he's a major player. He's moving in on Cafferty's operation. First, protection. Now, drugs. So, it's a gang war. That's what I'm trying to prevent. John, you know Cafferty as well as anyone. Yeah, so? So, I want you to visit him in Barlinnie. Try and talk some sense into him. A turf war's in no-one's interest. Cafferty's an animal. He's not going to listen to me. Just give it your best shot. I want you to work together on this. Ormond's heading the Telford case. He says he's close to a result. We don't want streets of blood before we get our act together, do we? Good to have you on board. 'Morris Cafferty. Edinburgh's most successful and ruthless gangster, 'or he was until Tommy Telford came on the scene.' Long time no see, Rebus. Come to make sure I'm still where you left me? I'm investigating a murder. Dealer of yours - David Rutman. Was it Telford? That's a matter for the police. It's pretty obvious he's moving in on your territory. That wee shite from Paisley? Word is he's on the up, and you are history. Is that a fact? Well, my boss has sent me here to warn you off, appeal for calm. A gang war's in no-one's interest. Am I right? Are you? Personally, I think it's a great idea. The gangsters kill each other. A man can get to the bar without all you arseholes in the way. I had an uncle like you. His pals were always giving him a doing. You're two of a kind, you and Telford - a pair of sad, bullying bastards. He's out there, and you're in here. He's young, and you're old. And you're going to lose. Away with you, Rebus. Your bum's out the window on this one. Well, that's my job done. How are the grandchildren? Don't even go there. I spoke to the governor, earlier. There might be problems with your visiting rights, even for close members of your family. You wouldn't dare. I would dare. I'm going to see you die in jail. And I can make sure you never see your grandchildren again. Don't you threaten me, Rebus. Give Telford the message. He's messing with the wrong man, and he's through. I don't care if he's got bent coppers, or if he's got European pals with red-hot currency. Well, I'm glad we had this wee chat. John? How are you getting on with Ormond? Oh, better the devil you know. I'll take that as a compliment. What's going on here? We're bursting. Crime Analysis have moved. We've got the War Crimes Unit. War Crimes Unit? It's a crap, political put-up job. Good morning, DI Rebus. Morning, ma'am. Shit. 'Last time I met DCI Templer, she was investigating 'accusations of corruption and murder against me. 'Now she was heading the War Crimes Unit, seconded to Fort Apache.' SHOUTING Help! What's going on? I've got to get out of here. What's happening? Who's in there? I picked her up 20 minutes ago. She said she needed the loo. Come on! Get her legs. Get her out of here. She's trying to asphyxiate. Come on. Give us a hand. (COUGHS) Get it out, all out. Come on. (WAILS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) She's foreign. No shit, Sherlock. And desperate. Where did you find her? Down the Pleasance. That's a new patch on me. Me, too. It's OK. Nobody with her? Not that I saw. (SOBS) I'll want to talk to her later. Get on to the university for an interpreter. She's a Serbo-Croat. A Bosnian Muslim. Bosnian? Yes, from Sarajevo. Did you get a name? She told me Candice. But you don't believe her? It's not exactly ethnic, Inspector. Does she deny working as a prostitute? (SPEAKS SERBO-CROAT) ã15 a blow-job. Straight sex ã25. Unprotected an extra fiver. She understands all right. Ask her how she got here. (SPEAKS SERBO-CROAT) (SPEAKS SERBO-CROAT) She was offered a job as a maid in Britain. She had no money, and a child to support. She thought it was a good opportunity. She left Sarajevo. The first thing she remembers is a place with lots of bridges. Bridges? She was there for some time. (SPEAKS SERBO-CROAT) A big man, he kept her in a locked room with a guard. She was beaten... Violated. Raped. Then one day they put her in a car, and the next thing she knew... she was in Edinburgh. Who does she work for her here? (SPEAKS SERBO-CROAT) (SPEAKS SERBO-CROAT) She can't tell you. He'll kill her. Morris Cafferty. (SNIFFS) Telford. 'Tommy Telford was under 24-hour surveillance. 'He was the world's worst-kept secret. 'Sean Haddow - the one with the beard - one of Telford's enforcers. 'The big lunk with him - Kenny Houston. 'Brian Summers - otherwise known as Pretty Boy - 'Telford's right-hand man. 'They grew up in Paisley. 'Now, Pretty Boy was running the working girls. 'Thomas Telford - 'he took over this arcade when his business partner went for a piss, 'and never came back.' Who are you? DI Rebus. Ah, you're the one who put Cafferty inside. Yeah, I had that pleasure. I owe you, pal. What do you want? Can't you guess? It was nae me. I was nae there. I was with my mammy. One of Cafferty's men is dead. David Rutman. Someone shot him, cut his hand off for his drugs money. That definitely wasn't me. We're adding it to the list. Taking our time. I hear you're into prostitutes these days. Nah, not me. I never pay for it. Did you see that? That's the thing about games... once you've had an accident, you can start again. It's not so easy in life. Yeah? Well, let me tell you something. On the anniversary that I arrested him, I sent Morris Cafferty a card in Barlinnie. I could do the same for you. Hey! I never said you could. I'm warning you, Rebus. Stay out of my road. This is Tommy Telford. Is this the man? Yeah? Will you... If you help me, Candice. I'll help you. I'll get you back home, back to Sarajevo. Come on. I'll take you somewhere safe, somewhere you can sleep, OK? Sleep? 'She showed me all the places she'd had sex.' 'Nice hotels. Crap hotels.' 'All the places Telford took her.' 'I told Ormond that Candice could be a valuable witness against Telford.' 'I knew that was unlikely.' 'She was too frightened to testify.' 'Candice had brought me to this place, 'apparently one of Telford's favourite haunts, 'and I wanted to know why. 'I kept thinking, how many other girls were there like Candice? 'How many other girls had been stolen away? 'I just wanted her to be safe, 'not on the streets, or slammed up in a police cell.' Hello, Candice. I'm David Ormond. We're going to take very good care of you. Candice. Katarina. Katarina. She can identify Telford as her pimp. The indications are she was imprisoned and gang raped, so go gentle with her. I'm always gentle. Now, we need a full, written statement. I have to be sure she won't change her story. I've taken care of it. An interpreter will be with us. We'll talk tomorrow, then. See you, later. Katarina? Look, you'll be safe here. You'll be taken care of, but I have to go now. Stay. I can't. No-one knows you're here. Stay, please. (SPEAKS SERBO-CROAT) OK. It's all right. You'll be taken care of. All you have to do is baby-sit, and you make a mess of it. You just had to look after the girl. What happens? She ends up almost killing herself. This case depends upon a willing and co-operative witness. See if you can handle making a cup of tea. Did she say why she did it? Inspector Rebus... I would like to suggest another interpreter. I really don't have the stamina. She already trusts you. Really, it's appreciated. You're doing us a huge favour. Did she say why? She thinks she made a mistake talking to the police. She has a child back in Sarajevo. She's afraid someone may harm the child if she talks to the police. They're only trying to frighten her. Trust me. We'll look after her. I'll look after her. KNOCKING You get a good night's sleep. OK? John. Sleep, Katarina. DOOR SHUTS BUZZER Hi, Sammy. The front door was open. I thought I'd say hello. Yeah. Come on. Come in. Did you book the restaurant, like I asked? Yeah, do you want some coffee? Morning. Oh, for heaven's sake. It's not what you think. OK. She's in trouble. She needs a place to stay and I need her as a witness. I believe you. Thousands wouldn't. No, you may have a point there. It's not ideal. She shouldn't really be here with me but she can't be left on her own, either. You know... My flatmate's out of town for a couple of weeks. She could just crash with me. I don't think that's a good idea. Why not? I hate being on my own. I'd like the company. Well, she's... She's what? She's... Well, her English is practically non-existent. So we'll use sign language. It'll only be for a couple of days, I suppose. It's no problem. Are you sure? OK. OK. I owe you one. One? I'll just put the kettle on. I'll sort something else out as soon as I can. It's not a problem, Dad. Is she really in danger? No. You watch too many movies. Morning. You couldn't give me a hand, could you? Are these files confidential? They've been out there all night. I'm supposed to have staff. I haven't even got a window in my office. 40 boxes of files to read. All of my witnesses have got Alzheimer's. I spend most of my time in old folks' homes reliving World War II. I read about the Villefranche massacre. Is that one of yours? It's one of about 20 or so cases. It must get you down. You get used to it. I wouldn't. Something should have been done 40 years ago. There's no statute of limitations on genocide. But it's all political. We let these monsters walk away, and prosecute when they're too old to know they're alive. Well, we'll just have to agree to disagree. Yeah. Again. Look, can we just put the past behind us, and start afresh? Why? I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea about me. I won't. I read your annual appraisal. You shouldn't believe all you read. I'm really quite a fun guy. A coffee, please. Milk and sugar? Just milk. 'So what was Telford's interest in this place? 'It had more security than Fort Knox. 'Something was going on, and to find out what it was... 'I needed to get in. ' Back in 1961, there was an international agreement. Governments were allowed to produce heroin and cocaine. We were licensed in Britain. We produce methadone for addicts, pethidine for women in labour, diamorphine, and cocaine for use in medical procedures. The company supplied laudanum to the Victorians. We produce 70 tonnes of opiates a year, and around ã2,000,000 worth of pure cocaine. Is something funny? No, no. 'I had an idea about how to reel Telford in, 'thanks to my factory tour. 'And now, I was taking my daughter out to dinner for her birthday. 'Life was looking good.' Happy birthday, darling. Thanks, Dad. You must be minting it. Not really. I'll take it out of your mother's alimony. Enjoy. Have good time. Very good. We're working on her English. We started with Oasis lyrics. It could be worse. Just don't get her started on gangsta rap. Are you sure you don't want to come with us? She's tired. It's been stressful. She wants to be alone. How do you know all that? I'm a sensitive human being. Ah, OK. Right. Come on. Let's go. See you later. Doctor Slaven will be here in the morning. He'll take a statement. Goodbye. You are my wonderwall. I'm nobody's wonderwall. Good night. Bye now. Thanks. Good night. Right. I'll walk you back. Don't be daft. It's the wrong direction. Besides, I might not go back. I might find a party. Oh, where? I don't know. I've got my mobile. God. I'm feeling old. You are old. You're going grey. I am not. You are so. Ow, you bugger. I'm not grey. Thanks for the coat, Dad... and the hat. Bye, Dad. Keep the hat on. The Edinburgh winds will knock you over. So, what's happening? What's going on? There's no blood clot, and no laceration of the brain. We've had a look at her scans already. There's a lot of swelling here, and she's in a pretty deep coma. We'll keep her on the ventilator for a few days, then see what happens. Look, I'm sorry. I really am sorry. Yeah. Thank you. John. Hi, Jack. How is she? It's not so good, man. Shit. Come on. Oh, my baby. OK? I'll come round the hospital tomorrow. Yeah. Thanks, Jack. I'll take the chair. Thanks. Oh, John. What if she...? She'll get through it. She'll get through it. I know she will. How have you been? Yeah, great. Fine. Not bad at all. I keep thinking about that time we went to the seaside. Me and you and Sammy. Fife. You remember? Yeah. I wanted to go for a walk. So you said, "I'll stand watch." I went for a walk along the cliff tops. It was a bitter day, but beautiful. Rhona. You were reading a book. Or thinking how you'd fit up some villains, or whatever it was. And when I came back, Sammy was gone. 'Must have wandered off,' you said. Rhona, can you leave it, please? She was safe, OK? Safe and sound. In a hollow in the dunes - which collapsed! She was safe. No thanks to you. Look, can we not fight like this? I'm not. Oh, John. Look, I should've walked her home. Just say it. Say it. You should've walked her home. KNOCK AT DOOR 'My first thought was it's Telford. He's got Candice.' 'And then it dawned on me.' 'Someone must have followed me to Sammy's, my daughter's home, which meant...' 'What the hell had I done?' We underestimated Telford. He's had it under surveillance. His men are better at it. You should have left her at the safe house. I needed her to feel comfortable. Why Sammy's? She's done voluntary work. She's got the skills. That's pish! Did you not imagine that was a bit of a risk? Look! We need to find her, before Telford sells her to a Bangkok massage parlour. What? I think we've got a witness. What a screw-up. Yeah. Just tell him what you told me, right? Do you know the girl that lives in the basement? I've seen her around. Tasty. Do you know her friend? The foreign one? Aye. She went off with a couple of guys. What did they look like? You saw what they looked like? Maybe. One of them was pumped up - a body builder. The other guy was old - an old guy. Did they have a car? What kind of car? Green. A green one. Can you remember anything else? One was wearing a Newcastle shirt - a Geordie. How do you know he was a Geordie? I heard him speak. I cannae argue with that. 'We had to move fast.' 'I briefed Siobhan on the drugs factory, and I headed to Newcastle.' This is a cafe frequented by Telford. This building opposite has no sign on the door. It's not in the phone book, or street directory. It's called McKay's. That rings a bell. Munitions? Class A drugs. 'Ah, yeah.' 'Good work, Siobhan.' If Telford has got himself - John's idea is to send in an undercover man. See if he can sniff something out. John did have a suggestion - Jack Morton. 'He's undercover trained, and he's not from this division.' 'Candice had given us a description of the man who'd held her.' 'I got it faxed to Newcastle, and I was put in touch with a DI - name of Kenworthy.' Jake Tarawicz - pimp, extortionist - was a bouncer till he beat a man to death. He's local, with European connections. His grandparents fled the pogroms. 'He still has family in Bosnia.' 'It may explain why he set up a convoy.' 'What convoy?' 'Running aid lorries to former Yugoslavia - a real humanitarian.' 'A good way to smuggle people out.' 'Tarawicz is your best bet. Serbian girls are currency for him.' 'What about the connection with Telford?' 'That came as news to us.' Hello, Miriam. You're looking well. Have you lost weight? Have we met? No. This is DI Rebus. He's come from Edinburgh to see you. Am I a tourist attraction now? We've heard you're supplying prostitutes to Tommy Telford. Who me? That's rubbish. But you know Telford? This is harassment. I pay my business rates. I don't deserve this. You do admit that you know him. We're not after you this time. We just want to find one girl - Katarina, street name Candice. Never heard of her. Give her up, or we can make life much harder for you. I can't help you, pet. I don't run whores, not any more, and I don't grass to the police. You want to watch yourself with Telford. His last business partner thought he was a hard man. Took a walk up an alley, and he never came back. I can take care of myself. Let go of us, son. Just get Candice to me. That's all I'm asking. Don't make an enemy out of me. Hey, I love your Scottish accent. Listen, Jock. I'll ask around, since it means that much to you. I can't say fairer than that. (MUTTERS) That man's full of shite. Totally. (LAUGHS) Are you scared, pet? There's nothing to be scared of. Any change? No. You should get some sleep. When the sun goes down, and the moon comes up, and the old swing creaks in the dark, that's when we go to the park. Me, and Loopy, and Little Gee. All three. Softly down the staircase, through the haunty hall, down dustbin alley, past the ruined mill, so still. Just me, and Loopy, and Little Gee. And Little Gee doesn't like it. He's scared of the things he might see in the park, in the dark. There might be moon witches. Or man-eating trees. Or withers that wobble. Or old Scrawny Shins. Or hairy hobgoblins. Or black boggarts' knees... in the trees. Hi. John, I wasn't sure.... is it visiting time? Er, no. It's OK. They're pretty relaxed. You couldn't take me to the pub, could you? Thanks, Jessie. There you go. Thanks. Yeah, I know. Cheers. Cheers. So, how's the case going? Ah, keeping me busy. It stops me brooding. I gather you met Emir Slaven. Yeah, yeah. He's done some translation for us. He's a professor at Sammy's university. Do you know him? Have you met him socially? Professionally? He's not on one of your bloody lists, is he? He is. He's on one of your bloody war crimes lists. Is that why you came to see me today? You are something else. That's not the only reason, John. Look, I really shouldn't tell you anything. If one of my team is a war criminal, he's suspect. Candice could be killed. Go on, Gill. In Bosnia, in 1944, the Germans hanged a village of partisans from the trees in an orchard. Men, women, and children. A survivor put Slaven at the scene of the murders. He was a collaborator. We think he informed the Germans, and betrayed his own people. Dirty bastard. Did Slaven know where Candice was staying? Yeah, of course he did. I told him. I needed him, remember? For translation. Look, I'm breaking a lot of rules here, John. Slaven doesn't know he's under investigation. Keep it that way. Understood? Yeah. Yeah, understood. Someone at the university said you'd be here. My wife is... buried in this cemetery. So, I work... as part of a voluntary conservation group. It keeps me busy. I'm only part-time at the university. Do you require me for further translation duties? Candice is missing. That's a shame. We think she's been abducted by her pimp. She was a nice girl. We thought no-one knew she was in custody. That's why I asked my daughter to look after her. Yes, well, do let me know next time I can be of assistance. I wouldn't be that stupid, would I, asking my daughter, if I thought I was sailing a leaky ship? I'm asking you straight. Did you tell Telford we had Candice? Me? Yes! You! You're getting confused. I was brought in as a translator. I teach at university. You're a murdering bastard. Don't play the innocent. I don't know what you mean. I know about your war record, Doctor. Are you telling me I am under investigation? I need to find Candice. I'm worried about her safety. Deeply worried. Can you help? No. I cannot. THUNDER At last. Sorry, I had some business. Any news on Candice? No, no. This was unrelated. Hey, Jack. Managed to rope you in, eh? It was your idea. Cheers, pal. How did you get on in Newcastle? I met the guy who's supplying Telford's girls. There's rumours that he's expanding, and he's linked to a drug wholesaler That may be Telford. Two-way street. Drugs one way, girls the other. And I think Candice is dead. Maybe. Maybe not. They could be holding her. They could be holding her in a cupboard. There's always that hope. It's my fault. She should never have trusted me. Not to worry. We don't need her any more. OK. Listen up. McKay's. Now, this gang war is hotting up. I've been given the go-ahead to set up this undercover operation. PHONE RINGS It's a priority. Let's get it done. Fast, fast, fast. It's for you, John. It's DS Pryde. Hello. "John, I think we've found the car that hit Sammy." I'm on my way. Stay for the briefing. I need to go. It's been given a good going over. No coins, no map books, or cassettes. Is this it, do you think? It could be. I'm wondering why they stole it in the first place. A spot of joy-riding. Or maybe it was stolen to turn over a petrol station. They hit Sammy, and decide to jump ship. Or they were drunk, and ditched it. Or... Yes? Forget it. Are you OK? They found the car. I just got a call from Forensics. There's a handprint on it. Sammy's. Oh. The car hit her, and... I'm going to find the bastard that did this. John. So help me. You just need to think about Sammy. Pray for her to get well. That's your priority. Pray? 'Bill Pryde was a good, thorough copper, but hardly the sharpest knife in the drawer.' 'He had no chance of finding the man.' 'It was a pro job, some anonymous slimeball, hired by Telford, who'll die peacefully in his bed at 89.' 'Well, not if I could help it. I'd find him. Whatever the cost.' Back so soon? Keep it. By the look of you, I'd say your need was greater than mine. What do you want? I need your help. I never thought I'd hear those words. My daughter was in a hit-and-run. She's in a coma. I heard. You want me to find who hurt your girl? Why can't the police find him? They're looking in the wrong places. And where would be the right places? Telford. Telford paid somebody to hit her. You know that for a certainty? She was looking after someone for me. One of Telford's girls. They wanted to kill her, and hit Sammy instead. They look alike. It could be mistaken identity. It sounds possible. What do your colleagues say to this theory? They think it was a hit-and-run. So... Who do you want? Telford or the driver? The driver. I've already got my sights on Telford and Tarawicz. I'll bring them down for what they've done to Sammy and Candice. I don't believe it. I'm glad we're on the same side this time. So, when I find the driver... do you want him killed? No... Just deliver him to me. What will you do then? Kill him with your bare hands? I lit a candle for his soul. I'm not even a Catholic. He's not even dead yet. Just give him to me. There is a price to be paid. There always is. This is the price. From now on... you're my man. Agreed? Mr Rebus. Long time no see. How are you doing, Weasel? Not too bad. Except for this cough. Did Cafferty send you? Send? I prefer to say he asked me. We need to talk, Mr Rebus. So talk. Do you think it was a hit on your daughter? She was meant to die? Could be. A pro wouldn't screw up. I don't agree. Everyone messes up. We could do with seeing your files. Not possible. I thought you wanted Mr Cafferty's help. It was a Rover 600, stolen from George Street, abandoned later behind Dunlop Street. A radio and some tapes were lifted by someone. Scavengers. It could be. Tapes were Pagliacci, Turandot, La Boheme, and Roy Orbison, in case somebody tries to sell them as a job lot. A Rover 600. What colour? Sherwood green. Right. Thanks for that. Nice doing business with you, Mr Rebus. When will I hear from you? I'll be in touch. 'I was playing a very dangerous game.' 'I'd broken the rules. I'd made a pact with Cafferty.' 'And now Cafferty's war with Telford was heating up.' Tell Cafferty... this is from us. Argh! See you. Ay, nae bother. I haven't got it, Marty. I haven't got it, Marty! Where's the money? 'Oscars all round.' Marty and the boys were just heavy enough to make it look real. Then Sean Haddow helped me up, starts asking me questions - not subtle. You don't think anyone twigged? No, I think they fell for it. 'They like a guard in their pocket. I fit the bill. I'm a dodgy type.' Very dodgy. It's all looking very promising. We suspect that Telford's got men inside McKay's. We're not sure how he's moving the drugs. I guess it's Telford's power base. It's up to Jack to find out as much as he can. "Can you take this lady to the airport?" Sure, no problem. What the hell's going on? I thought she wanted a lift. "There's been an explosion at Cafferty's cabs." I'm on my way. SCREECHING TYRES SIRENS We should've sold tickets. You're messing with the wrong man. Cafferty'll cream you for this. Since when was Cafferty paying your wages? What did you say?! I'm my own man. You're going down for this, Summers. You as well, Telford. Careful next time you're crossing the road. What do you mean by that? Get your hands off! I'm the psychotic here. Who was driving the car? I've not got a clue, all right? That wasn't us. That was more Cafferty's style. What about Candice? What? The Bosnian whore? Tarawicz has got her. Is she still in one piece? Of course. He's not going to harm her. He'd rather scratch the paintwork on his own car. And you think she'd testify against me? The wee cow. She's too fond of the green stuff. She's a whore, Rebus, or had you forgot about that? If you don't believe me, you can ask her yourself. The Regent Garden's Hotel. 'It was nae us! It was Cafferty's style, Cafferty's style.' MUSIC AND CHATTER Katarina. Sorry. Katarina. Hey! Are you all right? If you're desperate, give us a fiver. You can have her. Come on. You're coming with me. Come on. No! Why I do that? You were abducted. You can press charges. Leave me alone. I happy now. Sammy is in hospital. These people tried to kill her. Go lost! Creep. I have Jake. He look after me. That's my girl. I'm supposed to be under cover. Can you not find some other shoulder to cry on? This is nae about the booze, Jack. I'm in the shit. I made an arse of things. I took a witness in danger to stay with Sammy. But it wasn't about mistaken identity. Candice was never the target. She's alive and well and working for Tarawicz. I think someone hit Sammy to get at me. Telford? I don't think so. He's a shit and a pimp, but he just wants business. And not Tarawicz either. He's got no reason. I think it was Cafferty. Cafferty wouldn't be inside if it wasn't for me. He's got every reason to hate you, but why would he wait so long to take his revenge? Do you know what makes me sick? I sat opposite the man. I shook the prick's hand. You did? Why? You said you were in the shit. John? 'I couldn't tell him.' 'He was my best friend.' 'We'd broken rules and even laws together, but I couldn't tell Jack I'd sold my soul to Cafferty, because I knew he'd have to turn me in.' DRUNKEN SINGING ♪ On whisky and beer... ♪ Arrrgh! Have your go, then. Arrrgh! 'Arrrgh!' WHISTLE We need to talk. I've nothing to say to you or Cafferty. He's a liar. He's screwing with me. The deal is off. Here. Mr Cafferty's a man of his word. I assure you, Rebus, the deal stands. We must go for another drink some time, John. Yeah, any time. Let's not stand on ceremony just because I'm your senior officer. Sorry. I told you to keep it under wraps. I needed to find Candice. Slaven was my last hope. Forewarned is forearmed. I forearmed you, but I didn't want you to screw up an investigation. It's done now. I'm sorry. Slaven is off limits. Steer clear of him. He's a suspect. What's the harm in knowing he's being investigated? I'd have thought that's obvious. What's the big secret, Gill? I have to tread carefully. Slaven's protected? Other agencies are involved in the investigation. Other agencies?! Hi. Who? Who? MI5? Special Branch? It must be nice to have friends in high places. Slaven has provided useful information. He has the blood of 200 people on his hands. I work to the brief I'm given. I give him a scare. He phones Whitehall. They call the chief, who kicks your arse, and some slimy mass murderer has crawled out - That's not the way it is. Slaven is a security asset. Asset! It makes me sick. I wanting see her. Does Tarawicz know you're here? No. He sleep. Is she... Is she be OK? Yeah, I hope so. How did Tarawicz find you? Slaven. He came fetch me. He say he take me to you. I must go. Back to Tarawicz? You should leave him. He say he kill me. He say he find my son in Bosnia, he kill him. He's lying. If you don't leave him, you'll never see your son again. You have to leave him. ♪ OPERA TURNS OFF RECORD PLAYER Relaxing after your exertions, doctor? What are you doing here? Get out, or I'll call the police. I am the police. I spoke to Candice. I had no choice. Yeah. That's right. You had no choice. They would kill me, if I did not. Yeah, and they meant it. You had no choice. Listen, I am an academic. I was in over my head. No choice. I want to know about Telford. How did you meet him? I use a pager service... for girls. A man came to see me. Which man? What was his name? He was called Pretty Boy. He offered me money to translate for the girls. I met Telford, taught him a few phrases. He was adept, very bright. I enjoyed meeting the girls. I don't often get to speak with my own people. Your own people? You betrayed your own people. Why make things deliberately hard for me? Am I being charged? Am I under arrest? No. No charges. You're free. But I want information, and you are going to get it. You want me to be an informer? Yes, I do. Otherwise, I'll tell the press you're a war criminal. I'll tell them about Telford. I will tell them everything. They'll stick to you like flies on shite. From now on, I own you. I had no choice. 'Always take the hat.' Edinburgh winds will knock you over. That's my girl... Oh, boy. Just one sip a day. I'm allowed that much. I wonder what drove him to it? I need a favour, Gill. You've had your favour. I want this hushed up. It is hushed up. No-one will ever know about war crimes, or the role DI John Rebus had in this affair. I've got my own arse to protect. I need it all hushed up. The death, everything. Let's keep it under wraps. No crime report. No liaison with the press. I need to keep Slaven alive for another 24 hours. Please, Gill. The good news is... I'm now bent. The bad news is there's been a security clampdown at the factory. Telford can't get his stuff out. What are you saying? We've wasted our time? Telford's going to rob the place. As I said, Saturday night, the meat lorry will be packed for you, the drugs are in the carcass. Saturday night, I've been told to keep my eyes shut. How much are you getting? Five grand. You told me ten. You want to get your hair cut, son. I like my hair the way it is. This is cash on delivery, Tarawicz. Do you think you can manage that? Yeah. You'll have your wedge. Don't worry, pet. It will have to be a major armed operation. Crime Squad can lend us bodies. We'll need one armed response unit. We've only got 24 hours. I'm confident I can set up a fully-briefed operation. "Be at McKay's factory in Slateford tomorrow night." "It's going to be turned over." "Six men, tooled up, driving a lorry." "If you're canny, you can catch all of them." I don't get it. I do. Someone else has a man inside Telford's operation. 'MORTON: Tomorrow night.' Tomorrow night. A lovely little Chardonnay. With that inescapable aftertaste of apple juice. Take care, Jack. Right. The first person to speak will be me. Is that understood? They could be listening in. "So if anybody uses a radio before me, they're in farmyard shite." Now, I won't utter a sound until the vehicle enters the compound... Shut up. (He's opening the gates.) (OK... They're in.) Wait till they switch the engine off. Go. "Attention. Armed police. Open the cab doors, slowly, and step out one by one, with your hands held high." The engine's still running. The truck. Its engine's still running. "Discard weapons before coming out." Ormond! Tell them to switch off the engine! "The gates are blocked." Tell them to get rid of the keys! "..anybody getting hurt." Oh, shit. Ormond, tell them to switch off the engine and ditch the keys. Get out! "No shooting! Officer too close." GUNFIRE Shit! GUNFIRE Shit! MACHINE-GUN FIRE Are you all right? All right! Jack's been hit. Get an ambulance! It's all right. It's OK. Hang in there, Jack. (GROANS) Jack. It wasn't your fault. No. It was mine, sir. I'm sorry. I screwed up. How's it going? Not too well. Telford's men are loyal. We've got three. Haddow and Houston, we got at the raid. We've pulled in Pretty Boy Summers. They won't say a word. I can make Summers talk. There's nothing to link him to the raid. John, I'm not sure that you should - I can make him talk. I promise. Just give me a chance. No tapes. No lawyers. Just you and me. We can take it outside, if you like, pal. Fists OK, or malkies? You're a smart guy. And you're a very pretty policeman. What did Tarawicz offer you? I'd like my lawyer. Blades, fists, or words. Your choice. What did Tarawicz offer you? I've never been hit by a policeman before. I feel... blooded. John! What did he offer you? This has to stop! I can't let you do this. Get the little shit out of here. We've got Slaven. That's all we need. Where is he? He's in 2. Have you got his statement typed up? I'll have another look at it. What? Oh, OK. OK. I supply prostitutes to Prof Slaven. That's no crime. Well... yes. Where are you going with this? You got Slaven to do some translating. We got Slaven to do some translating for us. Small world. He realised we were after Telford and tipped you off, and Candice was snatched. How come it was Tarawicz's guy doing the snatch? I puzzled at that. You're Tarawicz's guy. Slaven was there when she was snatched. He was there when Tarawicz picked her up. He knows you two are partners. He's already told us all of this. Once we put it onto tape, I'm going to make two copies. I'll send one to Tommy and one to Cafferty. You're bluffing. I could also tell him it was you that tipped us off about the raid. Slaven's a gutless old pervert. He'd never speak against me. Are you sure? Did you know... that Slaven's a war criminal? He's driven by a far stronger force than fear - remorse. We all underestimated Tarawicz. He had his sights set on running Edinburgh. He enlisted you, bombed Cafferty, and waited for Telford to be blamed. He attacked Telford's men. Everyone thought it was Cafferty, then everybody wants to join in. But the minute you walk out of here, you're a dead man... unless we help you. 'We got it all - the drug shipments, the war with Cafferty, the Newcastle connection, the prostitutes.' 'Once Pretty Boy had started, the others threw theirs in, too.' 'We had more than enough to nail Telford.' 'Tarawicz was smart, and ruthless.' 'And he almost thrashed the lot of us.' 'Almost.' 'The killers were never caught.' 'But the word was that it was the work of one Morris Cafferty.' 'With Tarawicz's death, Katarina was free.' 'She was reunited with her son in Sarajevo.' I owe you. You're welcome. Time for Slaven to die... before he starts to reek. I'm on it. Am I going to drink this alone? I could always stay and watch you. Now, that is an offer. 'Weasel paid me one last visit.' 'I was about to find out who had hit Sammy.' You did well with Telford. Mr Cafferty's pleased. I didn't do it for Cafferty. How long have you been holding him? Nothing gets past you, does it? How long? A few days. We had to be sure we had the right one. You're not setting up some loser, to take the blame, and say the right thing? Such as? Such as he was on Telford's pay. Rather than Mr Cafferty's, you mean? Was it Cafferty? No. I give you my word. That's worth something, is it? You're going to have to see for yourself, aren't you? Well? Is this your idea of a joke? It's nae joke, Rebus. This bastard hit your daughter. He was too short to reach the pedals. So... what do you want to do about him? Cut the tapes. What? Just cut the fucking tapes! You heard the man. 'I'd been wrong all along.' 'There was no conspiracy.' 'There were no hit men.' 'It was a simple, stupid accident.' 'Shit happens.' 'But good things happen, too.' 'And Sammy was going to make it.' I used to bring you up here when you were wee. Yeah? I think I remember that. Really? You do? 'Up to the house, to the stair, to the bed where we ought to be, me and Loopy, and Little Gee.'
