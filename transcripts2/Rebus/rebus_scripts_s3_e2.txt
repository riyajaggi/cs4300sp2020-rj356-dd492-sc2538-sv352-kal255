 Mr Jack' is this your idea of charity? Are you going to be known as ''Jack of all Trades''? You realized this was a brothel' Mr Jack? (TV) ..Borders Police on an alleged brothel in the PortobeIIo area of the city produced a bigger fish than they had expected. Millionaire and self-styled anti-poverty activist' Gregor Jack' was bundled... You Like him' don't you? What were the press doing there? He's just a Ioan shark. - He's not a Ioan shark. - Really? Cash Attack Debt Consolidation on every high street? It's legalised Ioan sharking if you ask me! He lends money to poor people at a price they can afford. (TV) ..to concentrate upon giving something back. You do Like him! Is that because he tells it Like it is? (TV) This week sees his Investment Africa conference open in the capital... I've had it. I'm going back to the office. I'II see you in the morning. (TV) Mr Jack's views are highly controversial' attracting admiration and outrage from public and experts alike. Now for a look at the weather... It's down by the water. Morning. - Morning. - Morning. - Your coffee's up here' sir. - One' two' three' lift! I've been processing hookers till 4am. - Any under-age? - No. Well you're on a real investigation now. She was thrown' we think' off the path after she was killed. Somebody get those ladders down! There's a bruise on her face' probably a punch' but cause of death is more likeIy to be this - an impact blow with something solid. - A wall maybe. - When? Provisionally' somewhere between 11 and 1 am. After closing. Sir! Sir! Over here' sir! I found her ID card just over there. Must've fallen out her pocket. Janice WyIie. Works at Oga Petroleum. She had her uniform on. Maybe she was on her way home from work. Or going to work. Oh! Salt and sauce. Check out the nearest chip shops. Cheers then. I'II drive. Come on' you've been up all night. Convenient' eh? The only GOOD businessman gets caught in a brothel on the eve of his big conference. Or he could just have a penchant for sleazy sex. He is a middle-aged man. - It's DI Rebus! - Inspector! - Mr Rebus' can you give us a statement? - Mr Rebus! What's going on? What are we doing? We should be back at the office. What are we doing? You're not my boss. Yet! Flash car. - Go on' walk away! - You deal with the consequences! - That's all you're good for! - Gregor' I'm taking you for every penny! - Betrayed wife' I think? - This is private property. Sling your hook! - Mrs. Jack... - I've got to go! - Mrs. Jack! - Mrs. Jack! How do you feel about your husband's behavior? - Answer the question' Mrs. Jack. - My husband has acted foolishly. But he loves me and I love him. I will remain by his side. Mrs. Jack! (BARRAGE OF QUESTIONS ) And the nomination for the Best Supporting Wife goes to... Maybe working does some good! Kevin Urquart. I handle Gregor Jack's PR. - (LOUD SMASH) - Fucking bitch! Leave the bloody thing' GaiI! One day you reaIise that the woman you married is a selfish' manipulative' compassionless bitch from hell! Gregor! - Years of... - Mr Jack' this is Inspector Rebus. What do you want? As far as I'm concerned' I haven't committed a crime. Unless the lamp wants to make an official complaint. If you're not here to arrest me' why are you here? Can I have a word? GaiI' are you all right? Get me a dustpan and brush. I think you were set up. Well I appreciate your concern' but what's it to you? Did anyone know you were going to the brothel last night? No. No' nobody knew I was going there. A misguided solo mission. Right... Thanks for your time. Mr Jack! Something for the late news' Mr Jack? Nice car. The press'll love you in that. They'll be all over you Like... Like flies to shite! I'II get on to the car hire people. Kevin! A quiet word. What was he Like? Manky. 50s maybe. Kind o' jakie. Twattin' on aboot Jimi Hendrix and the Isle of Wight. Tryin' tae get aff wi' everyone - customers and staff. He was disgustin'! Oh' the things he was sayin'! If I send a car' would you come down to the station and look at some photos? Aye. Pint of water before bed - that's the answer. I'm not hung-over. - I was working. - Not! - I was. I was thinking. - And drinking. Spoke to our chip shop woman. What's a jakie? A junkie? No' a junkie's a junkie. A jakie's an alkie. - She's coming in to look at some photos. - No' ''photaes''. OK' conclusions so far. The killer intending sexual assault drags her under the bridge' she struggles' he punches her... She bangs her head and dies. He panics. Dumps her in the river and runs away. DI Rebus! The last time I looked at the rota' you were on the Dean Bridge killing. Did they find any children? The brothel raid' under-age sex? The intelligence was flawed. Where did it come from? A woman from a call-box in Harthill. Does Gregor Jack think he was set up? (KNOCK AT DOOR) There's another body. That's Liz Jack. She was killed by a blow to the head and before she was dumped in the river. What was she doing out here? 40 miles from home? She was killed in Edinburgh' then brought out here? Two killings' very similar. We heard her arguing with Gregor Jack before she died. He's not that stupid. He can't even de-snotter his nose without it being all over the press' let alone kill his wife. So we have a repeat killer who murdered both women or someone in Liz Jack's circle trying to make it look like that. What do you think? I'II go and tell Gregor Jack. - I can get someone from Family Liaison... - No' I'II do it. Different car. Maybe he took your advice. Must reaIise what a wise old fox you are. What's up? (RINGS DOORBELL) Like I told you before' I wasn't set up. I'm here on other business. I have to tell you... Your wife is dead. She was murdered. Who...? I don't know. But I will do my best to find out. Oh... Oh! I have to ask... - Where were you yesterday? - I was here. AII day. - Why do you need to know? - Routine. (GREGOR) I was here. With GaiI' uh... We were here all night preparing for the conference. We were... You see' we have to get the guy from the European Commission to sign for the Aid For Africa programme or else... Without the European... Where did Liz go after she left here? MonkfieId. She said she was going to MonkfieId in Mid Calder. - Gregor has a holiday home there. - Would you come down to the station? I'm very busy. She never told me where she was going. She never told me. We argued. The Last... The Last time we were together' we... Oh' I said terrible things to her. Jeez! Oh' dear. We found her body out in Mid Calder. Can you tell me what were Liz and Gregor arguing about? The same thing they always argue about. Gregor's money. She' um... She felt he was throwing it away on his charity work. She doesn't understand. It's not charity' it's investment and... OK... Liz said she was going to MonkfieId. - Yes. - You heard her say that to Gregor? No' just to me. She said it to me. Gregor didn't know where she was going. I need to get back. You and Gregor were in the house all day working? - Yes' all day and all night. - AII night? I slept in the guest room. - Alice' have you got something for me? - Aye. Are you sure this was him? He was in your chip shop? - Definitely. - OK' thank you. - Would you do...? - Right away' sir. - I'm going to need a car. - No problem. Joe can take you home. I know what it's Like. What? Being in Love with an older man. You end up making a fool out of yourself. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't care what she says. She's protecting him. - Maybe he's protecting her. - Maybe they're both telling the truth. The house was under siege on Tuesday. Gregor Jack couldn't... What are you' his defence counsel? (DOOR SLAMS OPEN) I hate hippies. Me too. And I used to be one. Looks Like he's done a runner. Right' get round all the neighbours. I want a search team down here! - Hmm. - Another day' another nutter. And another double murderer? I want a picture of William Glass circulated by the end of play today. - Yes' sir! - Where are we going? We'll take a wee birI round to Gregor Jack's holiday home. I didn't know you were having a thing with an older man. What? Well you told that girl... Oh' yeah' that. I'm not. She's hiding something. I thought' woman to woman' you know... Did you think I was talking about you? Not exactly Palm Springs' is it? Oi! I grew up in a place Like this. That explains a Lot. Holiday home? More Like a holiday hovel! We're not back on an under-age sex trail? Liz's car. Hmm... Detergent. Cleaning fluid. Blocked toilet. AII right' here's a story. Killer cleans up after the crime. And I mean REALLY cleans up. You see' bins are empty. New bags in them. Chucks something down the toilet. But he or she is in such a hurry... doesn't wait to see if it's actually flushed away. Siobhan... Latex gloves. Oh' Siobhan... If your mother could see you now! - That's them back. - Cheers. They found blood traces on the carpet. Someone was killed in there. - What about these tyre tracks? - Some recent ones. They could match the red hire car. They'll run a comparison ASAP. I thought you might be interested in this. The names are on the back. Greg senior' young Greg and Angela' Christmas 1 975. Taken there. 30 years ago. - How long until Forensics know anything? - Couple of hours at least. - Can we get a pint? - Sorry' bar's closed. - It has to be Gregor's. - Come on' just one. You don't seriously think Glass put a condom on before he killed her...? - So we pick him up? - Who? Gregor Jack. Blood on the walls' his car being there. - If we're quick' we'll get to Sandy Bell's. - It's too late! We've got a match. To an incident on the M25 two years ago. It's a Kevin Urquart. Thanks. Gregor Jack's PR man. So we're Looking at two suspects. William Glass' still at large. And Kevin Urquart. Ever been to Gregor Jack's cottage? No. If you've never been' you must have alpha male sperm' Kevin' because these littIe fellas made it all the way from your pants in Edinburgh to a toilet in Mid Calder! You had sex with Liz when? - Monday night. - Not Tuesday? No. Tuesday I was at Gregor's house in the morning' then I left. - Where did you go? - I spent the rest of the day at home alone. Why did you go to the cottage? Liz found out Gregor owned it and it bothered her. She wanted to have a nosey' one thing led to another and we ended up... - Shagging? - Making Love. So while Gregor Jack was getting lifted at the brothel' you and Liz were doing it? The tip-off about the under-age sex at the brothel... The call came from a woman. Phone box in Hart hill Mid Calder. He's in PR. He knows how to make an anonymous tip-off sound Like the real deal. They set Gregor up' then have a lovers' tiff. She reneges on the promise of the divorce. No! She used me. AII right' I... I helped Liz set Gregor up. But I didn't kill her. I haven't done anything wrong. Really? What about conspiring to destroy a man who...? - I'm talking about what's Iegally wrong. - I'm talking about what's wrong ! How come you went home on Tuesday afternoon? You're his PR man. He's in crisis after the brothel revelations and you go home? He fired me. That day. That's what they were screaming at each other about. She was gloating' rubbing it in that she'd got him by the balls and... The stupid cow told Gregor we'd set him up. This is an enterprise' an enterprise' the purpose of which is to deliver effective' market-driven poverty intervention to... GaiI' this is... I can't say this. This is just nonsense! Look' we'll do it' Gregor' OK? Just stay focused. This is what we've been working towards. Back to work? Yes' and it would be better if he wasn't disturbed. Why? Why do you do it? Because I can. Making money's easy. Making a difference' that's a challenge. You could say it's vanity. Well you could say that if you were a cynical bastard. You were set up. By Urquart and your wife. They were having an affair. - I see. - That's why you sacked him. No' no' I sacked him because he wasn't doing his job. Oh' I see what's happening here. You think that... You think that I found out that Liz and Urquart set me up' so I killed my wife. I don't know. I thought you were on my side. No' sir. I'm on your wife's side. (SIREN WAILS ) - He's here! - There he is! You two' round there! You' come with me! Over there! He's running up the stairs! William Glass... I am arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Janice WyIie. Watch your step' sir. (TEMPLER) Is it possible he did both murders? (REBUS ) Make it simpler if he did. - It gets Gregor Jack off the hook. - Why would I want him off the hook? I don't know. Because he's you with principles? There is nothing I'd Like better than to get a double confession and get down the pub. Are you partial to a fish supper' Willie? Forensic science. It's a wonderful thing. What they can get frae chip papers. Fish. Chips. Salt and sauce. Pickled onion. And saliva. Yours' Willie. We found that in the alley where you beat that poor woman to death. Her name is Janice WyIie. She worked in the garage at night. She spent her days studying to be a radiologist and then you... you' you littIe shite' you came along... I didnae mean tae! Look' I was just trying tae be friendly' but... Let me help you get this sentence down to a minimum. Did you kill her' Willie? Yes. We also found this. We extracted it from your collection. Maybe you were just being friendly on Tuesday in Mid Calder. Friendly with this lady? What? But she wouldn't touch a slimy littIe gargoyle Like you! No' I wasnae anywhere. Look' I havenae left Edinburgh... I have been sleeping in a doorway in George Street' by where C&A; was. I got soup off the Sally Army. OK... Book him. For the murder of Janice WyIie. But if his alibi for the Liz Jack killing checks out... - Urquhart's still prime suspect. - What? - Well he was in the cottage. - Doesn't mean he killed Liz. Siobhan's right. Plus' why would he? Well he and Liz already admitted that they tipped off the police and the press. - How did they know that? - What? How did they know Gregor Jack would be there on Monday night? I mean' a trip to a brothel is hardly something you'd advertise' is it? How did you know Gregor would be in a brothel on Monday night? Come on' Kev! Better an empty hoose than an angry tenant! A couple of weeks ago' I'm at a stag night and I end up in that brothel. I'm pissing about' pretending I'm Gregor Jack. AII-round good guy' saviour of the starving babies. One of the girls' Angela' she says I'm not Gregor Jack 'cause she knows him. Personally. - He's her client? - No. He's her brother. Rock concerts' telethons' celebrity-Ied appeals. ''AII you need is Love.'' A very worthy response to global poverty. But completely ineffective. Charity in this sense does not work. My aim' quite simply' is to put the charity industry out of business. I'm demanding that national and international agencies work to enable entrepreneurial skills to flourish' specific to the geopolitical circumstances' specific to... OK' OK. Targets... Geopolitics' delivery. I know' it's bullshit. I'II tell you what this is about. I'II tell you what I'm about. It's saving lives. Where do you want these kids to be in ten years' time? Waiting for some handouts as a result of some phone-in' some rock concert? What if there's a good film on that night' what if nothing happens? The difference with me is I'm investing in them. I'm giving them something much more than a handout. I'm not giving them something to eat for a day. I'm investing in them. That's what counts. That's what will make the difference. And what is gonna get them out of this is the profit motive' investment' Investment Africa. It worked for me and it can work for these millions. I have my critics. Some say I'm driven by vanity. They say I'm driven by self-interest. And you know' I tell you' it's not actually important. What is important is the outcome. That's what really counts. So I say to my critics and there are one or two' ''It's time for you to get up off your lazy arses and do what is right.'' Action is what is important. Action is what matters at the end of the day. Action is what will make a difference! I tell you' the ends really do justify the means! (APPLAUSE) OK' what's your problem now? Angela. You never told me you had a sister. No. I never told you I could posh and text at the same time either! Because I didn't think it was relevant to the murder of my wife. She was the bait. She was there to lure you into the brothel. I've been Looking for my sister for 1 2 years now. And in that time' I've never heard a word' not a thing' nothing. Until Urquart told you that she was in there? So why did you say to me you were there for sex? What's to hide? - He's right. We should go public with this. - Be quiet! It's a private matter. Mr Jack' since we found your wife's body' nothing in your life is a private matter. You don't understand' you don't understand the damage that you're doing' pulling away at this thread. It's a private matter. You're just gonna have to trust me on that. I'm sorry' I can't do that. Too Little faith' huh? Too much experience. Ah! A pint of heavy as poured by a student. Useless! She's a nag! William Glass was at a Sally Army soup stall at 11.20 on Tuesday night. Puts him 30 miles away from Liz Jack at the time of her murder. I just don't understand why you're so reluctant to arrest Gregor Jack. AII I'm saying is' if we go for him' we must be sure of our ground. He gets special treatment 'cause he helps starving babies? - No! - You've arrested suspects with a Lot less. I should have arrested him at the brothel. Him and his sister. Right' finish that' go back' get a picture of Angela' get it circulated. She's wanted in connection with a murder enquiry. - What are you gonna do? - What I do best. Drinking and thinking. Good night. Good night. (FRUIT MACHINE PLAYS JINGLE) Drunk yourself into a solution yet? The red car. He hired a car' didn't he? Yes. So he could have slipped out and fooled the press guys. After dark' non-descript car. Full beam. Except that GaiI says he was with her all night. But then Gail's... The press'll Love that if they ever get hold of it. Gregor Jack's long-lost sister. He went to the brothel to find her' not for sex. Or both. Is that what he's trying to hide? Incest? We've got something from the red car. - Prints. Good. How many sets? - Uh' one. - Not one set. One print. - How can there be one print on a hire car? I don't know. It belongs to a Vincent Hawks. - (MOBILE PHONE RINGS ) - Aged 22. On the sex offenders' register. Hello? GaiI? Yeah. No problem. See you there. She wants to talk to me. (DOOR OPENS' BELL RINGS ) (SIOBHAN) Can I have a latte please? Hello. I came as soon as I could. There's' um... There's something I haven't told you... I should have told you. Last Tuesday afternoon... when Liz stormed out of the house... She was destroying everything we were working for. She was a fucking bitch! And I'm glad she's dead. What are you saying? I killed her. I'm Looking for Vince Hawks. Across the road. Vincent Hawks? I'm on the programme' OK? I've taken ownership of my crimes. I see birds as human beings now. Honest. Very good' Vince. So' Tuesday' 2pm onwards' where were you? I don't know. I was... Aye' right' I was away fishin'. Mid Calder' by any chance? No. Linlithgow. Have you anyone who can verify that? I've got a big job on. I'm a bit busy just now. Is that what you do for a living? Cleaning cars? So it says. Comprehensive valet service. (MOBILE PHONE RINGS ) Siobhan? I went to the cottage to try and make her understand how her selfishness was going to wreck the campaign. (DOOR OPENS' BELL RINGS ) Hi. Go on. That's it. I... I got angry. I...hit her. She was dead. So... What happens now? Do I get formally charged? Uh-huh. There are just a couple of points I'd Like to clear up before we get you processed. You killed Liz' you dumped her body in the river. You drove back to Gregor's house in the hired car. Yes. Gregor said you were there all day. - You said Gregor was at the house all day. - He was. I wasn't. So he's lying? No' he... He'd been up all night. After the brothel business. I persuaded him to take a nap. Around six o'clock he said he couldn't sleep' so I offered him these. Temazepam. May I? I gave him three. When I got back after midnight' he was still sleeping. How come your fingerprints weren't on the car? - I wore gloves. - Ah' gloves. - So you didn't have the car cleaned? - No. Come on. Vincent Hawks' he's just given me a statement' saying that Gregor called him to the house to have the car cleaned. Comprehensively. Now' why would Gregor have it cleaned? To protect me. He Loves me. No' you Love him. You're protecting him. He put you up to this. No. Liz was selfish and greedy. And dead. Get in! You stayed at the house that night. What did he do? Because we think he murdered his wife and he dumped her in a ditch. You talk about doing what's right. So do what's right. Tell us the truth. - I'II stand by him' you know. - (REBUS ) Uh-huh. Gregor came back... He was in such a state' he... He asked me not to tell anyone he'd Left the house. He said...that Liz had Left. He couldn't say any more' but she was gone. It was for the best. And I'd have to trust him. And I did. I did trust him. We made Love. It was the happiest night of my life. (APPLAUSE) - There he is! - This way' please. (BARRAGE OF QUESTIONS ) You' your father and your sister at the holiday cottage. But it isnae a holiday cottage. It's where you and Angela were brought up. Aren't you investigating the murder of my wife? Tyre tracks found at the cottage' matching your hired Megane. - I told you. I didn't use that car. - That's not what GaiI says. Here's her statement. GaiI says more than her prayers. - Why was the car cleaned? - It was dirty. - Why did you seduce GaiI? - I didn't. She's fantasising. - Why did you ask her to cover for you? - Why are you persecuting me? - The problem with pathological idealism... - You're just rambling now! ..is your cause gives you permission to do what you want. Your destructive attitude' everything's shit to you' isn't it? People who try to make a difference' they're shit. Me' I'm shit! You see something good and you have to keep picking at it' kicking at it. Until it's destroyed. Why is that' Rebus? Huh? Why is that? I've only ever tried to do my best. As my old man used to say' sometimes your best isn't good enough. That's really strange because my old man used to say exactly the same thing. The difference is I never Let his cynical' bitter' disappointed attitude infect me! I grew up. If you're making a case against me based on Gail's statement' you're in trouble. Have you Looked inside her handbag lateIy? She's very big on self-medication. She won't make a reliable witness and you know that' so what are you going to do? Charge me or release me? What are you gonna do? Charge me or release me? Well he's certainly marked your card. We don't have the evidence to hold him. Release him. He did this. He did it! For Christ's sake' John! One minute you're running around trying to save his reputation' the next you're desperate to crucify him. He lied to me! Lying to you' John' is not against the law. He's hiding something' something from the past. (SIOBHAN) Yes' OK. Who isn't? Let it go. And Let him go too. I think we've found her - Angela. Listen' my apologies for sounding off at you back there. This is the right outcome. - We'll just have to trust you on that? - That's right' aye. Mr Jack! We just got a sighting of Angela. Where is she? I'II go and get her. Best you go home' sir. I'II Let you know when I've got her safe. That's what we pay our taxes for' isn't it? She's in there now. Aye. In the back. - OK. - She's right at the back. OK' thanks' Joe. Our proactive unit says she's been in there every day for two weeks' dawn till dusk. Owner reckons she's blown at least five grand. Bastard! Angela... We've come to take you home. Home? Your brother's waiting for you. This is crap! You never get a hold after a win. The machines are fixed in here! Why are you so scared of him? I'm not scared of him. I' uh... He gave me money to go back to London and I spent it all on this stupid machine. He'll be mad when he finds out' eh? Hey! Did you win one of these Last week? You were at the cottage' weren't you? You saw him do it. - That's why you're afraid of him. - No. - You saw him kill her. - No' he's a good man. Forget the ''good man'' crap' Angela. He murdered his wife! No' he didn't. I did. I killed her. I've won! Will I get a hold? Sometimes you get a hold after a jackpot! - Listen... - Leave me alone' for God's sake! Nowhere to go' is there? You want the truth to come out. That's why you're here. Liz found me at the brothel. I thought she wanted to be my friend and... She gave me a key to the cottage. Then she came up and kept getting me more and more drunk. And I... Oh' God' I... told her what Gregor did. I...hit her. Gregor arrived and cleaned up the mess? What did you tell Liz? What was it that Gregor was trying to hide? It was 30 years ago. 30 years' it... It doesn't matter now. It doesn't make him a bad person' does it? I told her. I shouldn't have told her. Angela... Angela! You're punishing yourself. And you'll go on punishing yourself. I killed her. Till you tell me the truth. I Let him down' I Let him down' I Let him down! (HORN BLARES' TYRES SCREECH) I killed her. I was nine. I was... ..playing in the garden and... It was...New Year's Day' 1 976. But it was sunny. I was...only nine. AII right? Yeah. Angela? She's under arrest. I'll do what I can for her. You know' mitigating circumstances. I went up to the cottage to try to reason with Liz. When I got there' she was dead. I wrapped her body up. I put her in the car. And I Left her in the river. I was just trying to protect my sister. Or yourself. Right' boys' what are you after? I'II have a black coffee and a roll and square sausage. I'II have a black coffee too. And' erm' an Empire biscuit' please. You know what Angela called Empire biscuits when she was a wee lassie? Vampire biscuits! ''Can I have a vampire biscuit?'' New Year's Day. 1 976. What happened then... That's what made Angela what she is. It polluted her whole Life. And I'm sorry. Every day' I'm sorry. But I couldn't help what I did. You don't know what it was Like' the beatings. Then when he turned on her... One blow...in anger. Nobody missed the bastard. My mother thought he'd walked out on us. She thanked God for that! Nobody even reported him missing. You've got to understand' it was in the heat of the moment. How many times have I heard that? ''I lost my temper. ''I didn't mean it. Everything just got out of control.'' Self-control was an option. You didn't use it. She was nine years old. He broke her jaw. She was tiny' defenseless. And because she was tiny and defenseless' he broke her fucking jaw.
