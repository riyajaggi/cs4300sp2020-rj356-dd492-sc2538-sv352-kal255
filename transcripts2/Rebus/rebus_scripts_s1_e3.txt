She gave him an even sorer pair of balls. She's got good hands with the nightstick. I should have been here. Jim Margolies. We called him 'Fast Track'. He'll make chief inspector in a year, assistant chief constable in five. I read an article in the force. A great hound and a decent bloke. I know that guy.

 John? John Rebus? How are you doing? It's me. Sorry? -It's Mee, Barney Mee. Barney, my God. You shouldn't have been able to get in here. -I said we were old school pals. - Listen I'm a bit... - I wouldn't normally bother you ... but I have a bit of a problem. It is our boy, Stuart. He's gone missing. Four days now He was at this pub. -What age is he? Nineteen. In a pub, Barney? We haven't heard from him at all. For missing persons you need the third floor. Tell him I sent you. They just said not to worry. Well then don't, Let them deal with it. I'm really sorry but I gotta go. -Already? Thanks anyway. Third floor, Barney. Let me introduce you two. This is Darren Rough. Inspector Rebus. I arrested Darren three years ago. Into feeling the little boys. He accused me of assault He got six years. How did you get out so soon, Darren? Good behavior. Darren has broken his parole. Gentlemen, can I have a word please? Job well done at the zoo. Clarke tells me the gunman's confessed to the lot. Teamwork, nothing like it. eh John? Yes, sir. So, why screw up a good day's work by chasing after the animals? He was at it, he was photographing the kids He was photographing...the penguins. His social worker informs us he's joined a photography club as part of his rehabilitation He's a known pedophile. He's a known troublemaker who has accused you of assault in the past. Leave him alone. Was that it, sir?. -No. You take him home, John. I'm not a bloody taxi service -I don't want him filing for harassment - Get rid of him. Give us a minute, Mr. Rough. - See ya. - Bring him along. Take him? What was that about? Just a Police Federation meeting. - Are you coming with us? -I want to see where this bastard's living. Come here. Give me that. Get out. Stay away from here, OK. Friend of yours? Nice view. -I don't look at the kids You just score dope off them. -Billy boy's my pal He is eight years old. You can't touch me, I've got protection. Who's protecting you from us? I promise you, if you so much as breathe near that kid, I will  All right, John. -Get it? Out of the road. Just stay away from here, okay? -Why should I? Is he a pedophile? Wait a minute, you're no' leavin him here. -What's going on? -He just told me him in #1 is a beast. You all right? - Sure you're OK? - I said I'm fine. I'm sorry for biting your head off back there. That guy still gets to me. Why don't you come for dinner tonight. My parents are coming but don't let that put you off. - I'll throw in a bottle of malt. - That's my kind of dinner The good stuff. Just let me out here. I have to pick up Mary's Violin from the mender's. I'll see you about seven, yeah? After talking to filth like Darren Rough, I felt like I needed a shower. But I needed a drink more. You think you're hardened enough to deal with anything But child abuse makes me ashamed to be part of the human race. What are you up to, Rebus? Hello, Johnny. Been awhile. What are you doing here? I mean, How are you? Can I get you a drink? - Barney's just getting one. - Barney? My husband? You look like you could use a seat, Johnny. So it's your son that's missing? Your son. What happened? Him and his mates come to Edinburgh every couple of weeks. Then they go to a bar, clubbing, that sort of thing. - They usually get the last train or the night bus. - Never any problems. And then about four days ago, Friday ... they went as usual. Saturday I got up ... Barney ... How in the name of God could she end up with Barney? The best looking girl in town, and she chose him. ...disappeared. -Sorry. Who? Stuart, our son. Just disappeared. -In Guiser's bar, Rose Street. Was there a quarrel, a fight with his pals? -That's what I'm saying, nothing. Maybe he just met a girl. -Johnny, he's engaged. I know my son. He would never go away without telling me, never. He's got no clothes, and he left his car. - Have the police talked to these two pals? -Joey and Pete? The police hardly even spoke to me. I'm busy tonight, but I'm sure I can do something in the morning. That's great. - And I'll check the pub for security video. - See? I told you he was the man. We've got to go for that train. Thanks, John. Come on, Janice. Until tomorrow, Johnny. Thank you. And the twenty years since I'd last seen her were like twenty minutes. And I knew I couldn't wait to see her again. Hi there. Do you want to see my goldfish? -Hold me back! You're a big girl. Jim's not back yet. -What do you think? Al dente or what? - It's perfect. - Needs more salt. You take m even. For a man who has everything, a family to share it with Father a doctor; wife an ex-model and cordon bleu cook ... 2.4 kids and a house on the grange. Game, set, and match. - She's got fin rot. - Let's see. Get this man a drink. Daddy! Okay, everyone. In the kitchen, go on. - Doesn't get much better than that. - Good whiskey's wasted on me. So anyway, all of a sudden There she is on the other side of the bar ... And I'm in the middle of "Some Enchanted Evening" My first girlfriend. And I've thought of nothing else since. - I nearly asked her out there and then. -Why didn't you? Her husband ... - He's a very nice guy. - She gave you the eye. That's her adultery, not yours. No, I couldn't. Couldn't handle the guilt. Why do you continually need to find a stick to beat yourself with? Relax. I haven't been sleeping that well lately. Have another drink then. He talked to our Billy again. Go home. Back! Back off, alright? Open up, Darren. It's the police. Back off! Darren? Darren? Who did this? -Let's get him out of here. -Leave me alone. -Come on, we'll take you down to the station. -No, I'm not going there. -Don't you come near me. -He's the least of your worries. -That lot out there, they want your balls on toast -I'm not comin' with you. Just find me somewhere else. Do yourself a favor eh? Stay away from Billy. -All right folks, Good news. -Where is he? He's staying here for just now. Listen! We'll have him out of here within the day, OK? You're just going to have to trust me, we need more time. Just go home. Hey, cop! If that beast's not out of here there's murder to come. Yeah, I'm still here. I'm not a social worker, you are. So make time. I don't mean next week. This guy needs a place to stay now, I'm serious. OK. Thanks. You think back on your life ... you realize you have no idea how important some people are for you. Until it's too late. Dysart. But it could be any one of a dozen villages. King Lassie, Thornton, Lochgelly. All pit towns. All the pits closed. Abandoned communities searching for a new reason to exist. And then I remembered why I had to get out all those years ago. There's nowhere to hide in a small town. Hi, Johnny. Thanks for coming. Hi, Johnny. Thanks for coming. Well, are you gonna come in or no'? Yeah...yeah. Word had got out. The posse was there in force. And at the centre of it all, sitting like Jabba the Hut, was the woman herself. Janice's mother. Janice asked me if I remembered her. It was a bit like being asked if you remember toothache. She never liked me then, and she sure as hell didn't like me now. - And what is it you are, John? A Corporal now? -Johnny's left the army years since, mom. -Couldn't stick it, eh? -He is a policeman. -He's going to help us find Stuart. -I told you he'd never make a go of it. -His father was the same. -He always spoke very highly of you, Mrs. Playfair. Well it's more than I did of him. And his poor mother. -Who can blame her? -For what? Lets...let's just get the guys and go for a chat. - And you last saw Stuart at half past 10 that night? - Yeah -In Guiser's Bar, Rose Street. -With a girl? -Aye. -Which girl? -Never seen her close up. Look, don't piss me about. I've come forty miles to talk to you, your pal's been missing a week! He could be dead, he could be lying in a ditch somewhere, do you understand? You weren't there at all, were you? Were you? No. Where were you? Disco, was it? Picking up students at the Queen Margaret? Aye...aye I was. Nothing changes. So, once again - When you last see Stuart? At Waverley Station. -Go on. -It was the same every week. He'd leave us there and go to Guiser's bar to meet the lassie. He'd never let us come. -How long had this been going on? -About six months. Six Months! -What else have you been lyin' about? -Nothing. -We don't know anything else. Honest. -Get out of my sight. Go! Your boy had a secret, Janice. And these two weren't in on it. Where's the fiance? -Helen? She's at the salon. Who was that? -So, Helen - will she talk? -She'll talk all right. See we both put away 5 pound a week and in three years we'd have enough to get the photo engaged Then we'll get the rings, and then we'll save up for the wedding. And I was saying to Gretchen ... It's an Urchin cut, huh? There is a lovely leather suite at Hallmark and it's only 950 pounds and it'll go so well with the curtains from my mom's catalogue. They are kind of gold fleur de lis embossed. No, they're more appliqu?d than embossed. They're kind of beige and maroony coloured. I got the feeling that anyone engaged to Helen would be saving for a long, long time. Somehow I couldn't put her together with the boy in the picture. Remember when ***** was here? We climbed to the top to see the other side of the world. Now it's probably in some museum. You're lucky, Johnny. -You got away. -Did I? -What about you, did you never think of leaving? -I never thought about it. Yes you did. I stood here - right here. -All that last night waiting for you. -Waiting? -I gave your mom a message asking you to meet me here. -She never gave it to me. -I thought you'd stood me up. -I cried for a week once you'd gone. Janice... -I'd really like to see you. -I can't do this. I'm gonna have to go. I'll be in touch. Soon. My joy at spending time with Janice after all these years was short lived I got the news on my way back from Dysart. Far as we can work out he fell from somewhere up there. -Fell? -Or Jumped? Or was pushed. Late last night. -Who found him? -A jogger. This morning. -Katherine? Has anyone told... -Yes, that's dealt with. Listen, John. Just go home. We can cope with everything here. Have you found anything yet? Nothing so far. I looked up and saw Greenfields estate. I have an image of Darren Rough looking at us right now. Laughing at us. A tragic accident. A guy climbs up the Crags in the middle of the night with no coat during a rainstorm and trips? -If he was up there it was for a reason. -You know why people go up the crags. Forget it, Siobhan, he wasn't suicidal. -If Jim was just a punter... -But he is not a punter, is he. -You're reacting emotionally. Damned right. Someone or something lured him up there. I cannot launch a murder inquiry. The post-mortem was inconclusive. And I am as upset about this as you are. If Jim's death has something to do with the job I want you to find out. He was being a bit distant lately. But no more than usual. We had dinner with friends. We came home, got the kids to bed. He said he was going for a walk. He didn't mention anything specific? Anyone he had to meet? No. I waited up for him, but he never... He never came back. If there's anything I can do for you, Katherine, anything you need... My sister's coming over later. We'll be fine, won't we, Mary? My, my, you're a clever girl, aren't you? Piano and violin. I don't play the violin, silly. What gave you that idea? My mistake. Why would Jim lie about something as unimportant a child's violin? The owner had never heard of Jim Margolies. He hadn't gone into the shop that night, or any night. What on earth had he been up to? Are you working? Are you? I'm resting between engagements. What is it, then? Sight seeing? -Have you ever seen this guy around here? - Silver Merc., L535 GUL. What are you on about? -It's a cop. With a silver Merc. Check the wall there. Leanne and Francine? The girls chalk up dodgy customers. He wasn't a dodgy customer. -No, and I'm a Carmelite nun. I'm telling you, if he was involved with women around here, it was professionally. Please yourself. But see what Leanne and Francine say. Where are they? Around the corner, at the bowling alley. You're a barrier to trade. A tea, please. Jim had worked vice a few years back. If he had made enemies, maybe they'd come back to haunt him. -Are you Leanne and Francine? -No. -Leanne, stay off of my chips. Hold on. I'm 17. So's she. -We'll call that 13, then, eh. -We never knew the police guy. -Listen you could be in a lot of trouble. Answer the question. When did you see him last? -Thursday night. -What did he want? Information? -Was he asking you about anything? -No, he just wanted the same as usual. And what was the usual? He'd pick us up in the car, and then we'd both do the business. But Thursday was different. He was crying. Then he slapped her. He couldn't get it up so he slapped her. That was it. We ran off. Does anyone else know about this? Anyone asked you about it? No. Here. Go home girls. Watch telly, get a childhood. It felt like everything I'd thought of him was crumbling to dust in front of me. The perfect cop, the perfect husband, the perfect dad... Jim had a secret. A dangerous secret. But who else knew it? And was it worth killing him for? I didn't even want to think about that. Hello? Oh, Barney, Hi. Good news. I located a security video from Guiser's Bar. They're sending it over. Is Janice there? Right, leaflets. No, just tell her I called, and I'll be in touch when I've seen what's on the video. I was still convinced Jim hadn't committed suicide. The stuff in his locker had yielded nothing. I got to look more closely at his notebook. Inquiry? -Does the name Shiellion mean anything to you? -Some sort of institute in North Berwick. An orphanage. Do you know anything about an inquiry? -No, why do you want to know for? -Jim Margolies wanted to know. Shiellion was originally a workhouse. The council had converted it into a children's home in the 30's. It had finally been closed down Eight years ago. Snap. -We need to talk. -About what? Better come with me. I was very sorry to hear about Jim. -Even so, you should have come through me first. -Sorry? Before you tried to access the Shiellion files. Could we just rewind a minute? What are you doing here? Jim has never told you, did he? All I know about Jim is he had the address in his notebook along with the name and he'd torn the page out. -Darren Rough. -You know Darren Rough? Darren Rough was orphaned at the age of six. Shiellion house became his home. -He lived here? -For ten years. During which time he was sexually abused by two orderlies. Gordon Ince. And Ramsay Marshall. -When Darren left the home he turned abuser himself. -That much I know. -Jim got him put down for six years, didn't he? -Correct. Last summer I was asked to head up a team to build up a case against these two "gentlemen". Since then I've lost all my witnesses, all except one... that had the courage to stand up and testify in court against them. Darren Rough. I had him taken early out of jail, put him in a safe house... I was working on him for weeks. Everything was hunky dory. Until you went in with your size tens and ballsed it up. -Well, we should have been told about this. -John, you were. The moment I heard you'd lifted Rough I warned Jim Margolies. We were to meet for a full briefing. So why all the secrecy? The Shiellion enquiry was set up by the assistant chief constable on a need-to-know basis. Nobody did know, except Jim Margolies. What did Jim say when you told him about Darren Rough? -That the pair of you would deal with it. Where are you going? Where I should have gone the first time I saw Darren Rough's name in that notebook. Darren? Darren? Darren? You guard an empty bloody flat. Billy, is that you? -I told you to stay away from Billy, didn't I? -He's my friend. -What do you think you're doing? -Have you seen my door? By the time you find me somewhere safe I'll be dead. You're going nowhere until I get some answers. Jim Margolies ... Sit down! -Did Jim Margolies come and see you last week? -You were there. -After that. On Thursday. -Why don't you ask him. Because he's lying on a slab in the county. Oh no. No. Jim Margolies came by, didn't he? It was Jim that beat you up, wasn't it Darren? Why? Why, Darren? -Was it to do with Shiellion? -No one should know about Shiellion - I was promised. You can trust me. What did Jim want? -Want a cup of tea or something? -Aye. Siobhan, Templer around? -She's in her office. -What's all this? -Protective custody. -John, there's a package for you - a security video. -I'll check it later. I was about eight when it started. Ince or Marshall would come and get me from the dormitory at night. After lights-out. They took me down to the nurse's room. They said I was lucky. That they loved me. I felt special. Grateful even. They'd blindfold me. And stripped me. And then we played. That's what they called it. Playing games. This went on 'till I left the place. Eight years. Eight years of playing games. I just hope he's still able to give evidence. If not, I'll hold you personally ... -Why did they blindfold him? -What? Darren knew who Ince and Marshall were. So why did they blindfold him? -Did I say blindfold? -You did. Now why did they blindfold you? -I can't remember. -Do you want go back to your flat? Then tell me. Why the blindfold? It was ... It was so I couldn't see the other one. Was there someone else involved other than Ince and Marshall? Why the hell didn't you tell me, Darren? -Did you ever see this other person? -Not even a glimpse? -You're lying. -I never saw him. Not his face. I saw ... What? A uniform. That's all I saw. He was wearing a uniform. What kind of uniform? Police. It was a police uniform. I got him a safe house. You should look at this. When Jim Margolies was a young PC, his patch was East Linton. And slap in the middle of it: Shiellion house. Do you know something about Jim Margolies that I don't? He couldn't get it up, so he slapped her. -No. John, you better be levelling with me. Do you have any reason to think Jim might have been the third man? There were six other coppers based at East Linton any one of them could have been involved. Any one of them could have wanted Jim shut up. I'll say it again. Could Margolies have been the third man? I don't know. I need more time. -We haven't got any bloody time. I'm sorry, John. Look, I need a drink, are you coming? I've got something else going. You watch yourself on this one. Could get dirty. By now I felt dirty. I was implicated. I hadn't told her about the child prostitutes, about Jim. And I didn't even know why. All I wanted was to see Janice again. I just prayed there was something on that video. Hello? Listen, don't do anything. I'll be right there. -I've told you before, piss off. -I want to speak to your manager. -You can mail it to the shop. -All I want to do is put up some posters. Surely there's nothing to object to. -I can't help ya. -Just get me your manager, now. -Take your posters and get lost. -I want to speak to him. I'm not leaving here. Janice, calm down. He won't let me put the posters up, he's saying it's bad for business. Get your boss out here. Now. Is there a problem? -Weasel? Never knew this was one of yours. -My business interests are many and varied, Mr. Rebus. As are those of my security staff. Get out. -She was going to put these posters up in the club. -Get out. -I see you kept up with the bodybuilding, eh. -If we get any aggro I still have friends in the police. -Have you? -You tell me. -Well this lady is a friend of mine. -Pleasure. What can I do you for? Well? We get 800 folk a night here. I don't recognize the boy or the lassie. Are they...an item? Could be. Aye, could be. Fast forward to that later shot. Rewind. Freeze that. I think he's hailing a taxi. -Is that not Ryan's shift there? -You're not on. I want the driver. -Right, and I'll throw in Lord Lucan as a bonus. -I want that driver. -And I will be eternally grateful, Weasel. -Again? Listen, Janice. Don't worry about this 'mystery woman'. Why? This is good news. This could mean your wee boy's spent the last few days becoming a man. You'll let me know about the taxi? And I've spoken to Stuart's bank, they'll let me know the moment there's a withdrawal. This is above and beyond the call of duty, John. It's a welcome antidote to the stuff I've been dealing with the last few days. -I should go. -Yeah You've given me hope. It's an old story, isn't it? The allure of the big city. Sex and the single man. A beautiful woman. How beautiful? Very beautiful. And love is immortal. And death is only an horizon. Bear a grudge for any evil. I wondered if that included teenage prostitutes or pedophile rings. Jim had been well connected. The cream of Edinburgh society. They do death very well in this city. Very dignified, very discreet. It's the living part that the bourgeois have trouble with. And then it occurred to me - I've spent almost 20 years here ... and this lot still make me feel like a country hick from Fife. You look like you should be in the box yourself. This is getting very heavy, boss. I think Jim was making some sort of freelance investigation. Into what? A great loss. Well what, man? Well I'm not sure, but it's something do with Shiellion children's home. -Heard of it? -Yes, of course I have. -Templer says ... -Never mind what Templer says. Anything you find out, you report direct to me, do you understand? -She's investigating... -I'll deal with it. See you in my office tomorrow. Chin up. Thanks, John. -Is it okay if I even pop round sometime? -You are always welcome, you know that. -I just have some more questions. -Such as? -I'd like to have a look at Jim's coat. -Why? It seems odd that he went out on  a night like that without it on. Let the boy lie in peace. You don't know what you're dealing with here. Did Jim ever mention a a children's home called Shiellion? As far as we are concerned, my son's death was an accident. I don't believe it was. -Jim committed suicide. -How can you be so sure? -Because he's the second child we lost that way. When Jim was 15 he discovered his elder sister, Sarah. She had hanged herself. It preyed on Jim. Terribly. I'm afraid there's a history of suicide in my wife's family. I'm sorry, I wasn't aware. -It was in his nature, inspector. That is our family's tragedy. Do you know what catalyst caused this? -What made him do it? -I'm afraid not. Not yet. From the bottom of my heart ... Please ... Leave us to cope with this in our own way. His father was right. Something had brought Jim to the edge. I doubted if it had anything to do with Shiellion. My hunch, for what it was worth ... was guilt over the teenage prostitutes. I was ready to close the investigation. Until I looked through the files of the cops based at the Linton station in the late 80s. One of them had gone on to higher things. Police. It was a police uniform. Listen, Jill. I need to talk about something, but it's got to stay off the record. Off the record? What, are you a journalist now? A senior officer has made it known that I should report to him about your Shiellian inquiry.. I'm cut to the quick, Rebus. To think such things happen in the modern police force. He could be implicated. What? In Shiellion? Here is a list of the officers that worked with Jim in East Linton in the 80s. Look at the last one. Wilson. And he told you to bypass me and speak to him first? You know as well as me there's been rumours in town for years, about a secret ring of pedophiles. Lawyers, social workers, cops. This could be much bigger than just Ince and Marshall. And I think Jim Margolies was on to it. -And Wilson's involved too? -I don't want to think about it either. But I need to speak to Ince and Marshall. They could identify the third man. Forget it. Marshall is cracked up in a loony bin,  Ince has never talked in 15 years. -That's why I need to talk to Rough, for God's sake. -Then I just don't know who to talk to. Leave it with me. You look like you need cheering up, Mr. Rebus. Weasel, that is fantastic. -Do you want a drink? -Whisky. Two whiskies, Kenny. Weasel had found out the cab driver swore he took Stuart and his mystery woman to the Clipper nightclub in Leith. It was his last fare of the night and he got a huge tip. I hoped he was right. Because he got an even bigger one from me. We're looking for the manager, a Miss Amanda Petrie. Amma? Amma? Cops. -How does he know? -They always know. If it's about the license, I submitted it. -It's about a missing person's inquiry. This is my son, Stuart. -Does that face mean anything to you? -Don't think so. What's the problem? -We believe he was here last Friday night. -It's very busy on Fridays. Could you check your guest list? Please? It's very important to me. Nothing. And you're sure you don't recognize this guy? Or the woman with him? I wouldn't quote my own mother from that. What's up? And you are? This is my brother, Cameron. Do you know these people? They were here Friday. No. I was pissed anyway. Please, he's been missing for over a week. Maybe he just doesn't want to be found. -We'll leave you a couple of these, maybe you can put them up on your notice board? -No problem. And if you hear anything at all please ring that number. -Sure. -Thanks You don't have to take the train, Janice. -You can stay with me. -Johnny, no, I can't. -I can't get Stuart out of my head. -Then stay here, I'll help you find him. The last thing I need... I can't get involved. Please don't... Don't make this hard for me- I'm not here, leave a message. Hello, Johnny. It's me. I was a bit worried, about where Janice is. If you hear anything, let me know, eh. Hope everything's going all right with you. All the best. Bye. I'll take you to the station. -It's no bother -Bother? My life's falling apart at the seams here. -Janice, it's my fault. -No, John. It's my fault. You didn't exactly have to drag me here last night. If the day had started on a low, it was just about to go underground. What the hell are you playing at, Rebus? Putting my name  on a list of suspects for Templer to pick over? -You are not a suspect, sir. -I bloody well feel like one. If you have anything to ask me you ask me to my face. Is that clear? Is it clear? Yes, sir. Templer... Templer went straight to the Assistant Chief Constable. Now I know you don't give a toss about your career, but I care about mine. I asked you to clear up the death of Jim Margolies, not to throw around wild accusations at fellow officers. But Jim Margolies beat the truth out of Darren Rough. There was someone else, other than Ince and Marshall abusing the kids at Shiellion. -and Rough says it was a cop. -So, on the word of a nonce like Darren Rough... my name is to be dragged through the dust, Just because I spent some time at the same local cop shop as Jim Margolies ten years ago. Now listen ... I was inspector at East Linton for four years. There was no ring of pedophiles. And there was no police connection with Shiellion. -Well, if that's true ... -Are you doubting me? No, sir. But let me speak to Rough again, because he knows who this third guy was. I think Jim Margolies knew too, and that's what got him killed. Then you speak to Rough. And you keep me out of it. Yes, sir. Good move, straight to the ACC, Wanker. Cut it out, John. Just because you didn't have the balls to do it yourself. -Listen, I want to talk to Rough. -Forget it. Come on, you owe me. He knows who the third guy is. I don't doubt it. But you still can't talk to him. He's disappeared -He legged it from the safe house, we don't know where he is. -Wasn't it guarded? -There was nothing to guard him from. -Oh, fantastic. Wait a minute. If you hadn't broadcast it, he'd still be sitting there. So where have you looked? Sergeant Clarke is coordinating the search. Let me know if he comes anywhere near this investigation. I didn't know you were into porno, John. -What? -Bank of Scotland. -Very funny. -You're welcome. Yes, I'll hold. Stuart had made two withdrawals from the bank. The second one they caught on video. He is a she. Can I get a still from this? Do you know her? It was taken on the corner of Leith Walk and Great Junction Street. There's withdrawals made twice before. Here and here. Two days apart. We could stake out the surrounding ATMs. -We don't work like that Janice. -You're being defeatist. I'm being realistic. We don't have the manpower. Well if I'd been realistic I'd never had those posters printed. I'd have just listened to your pals in Missing Persons and done nothing. -Don't patronize me. -Keep your voice down. I am not some wifey to be consoled with a cup of tea and cuddle. -Why are you behaving like this? -Because my son is missing. And because I just left my husband in tears, he knows how I spent the night. All right. It's an Urchin cut. The hair. I knew I've seen it somewhere before. Short, blond. It's an Urchin cut. The woman on the boat. -Please, don't lose him. -It's all right, Janice, I won't lose him. Janice, wait. -Are you sure you want to go through with this? -I'm sure. You might discover something you wish you hadn't. I'm sure. Come with me, please? I don't think I can do this alone. Stuart, for God's sake please open the door. Stuart, come on. Open the door. Your mother just wants to talk to you. -I'm not coming back. - I don't want that. Please believe me. Just open the door, please. Come in. I want you to meet someone. We've already met her. Pleased to meet you. This is Cameron. Well? Say something, Mom. Please? -Listen, I think maybe I should ... -Is that it? What? You've put me through all this... Day after day of worry, just because you have a boyfriend? Just? Yeah, that would have gone down great in Dysart. Forget about the leather suite, Helen. I'm gay. Yeah, that's right, Gran.  My boyfriend, he wears frocks. On occasion. I thought you were dead. You selfish little bastard. How could you do that to me? I thought you were dead. Stop it. Please! No! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh well, as long as it doesn't scare the horses, eh? Put another one in there, Kenny. I came to you for help, Rebus. And all you've done is destroy my life. Kenny, leave it. You think I'm some daft Fifer who never had the gumption to get out? But let me tell you something. I never took anyone else's woman. Barney, honestly ... Stay away from Janice. You are even lower than the shit on my shoes. Double then, is it? I'm in love. Come on up. Don't worry, I washed it. I'll make you a coffee, huh? Still no sign of Darren Rough? -Vanished. Templer's dead set on blaming you. -I've been having these weird dreams lately. -Me too. A recurring one with Brad Pitt, a waterbed, and handcuffs. -Hi Rebus, it's Darren. -Where are you? I want to talk to you. I need to tell you the truth. -I know who the other man at Sheillian was. -Tell me where you are, I'll come and get you. I'm being followed. I'll meet you at Radical Road, off King's drive, you know it? Yeah I'll be... Here, are you all right, son? Shall I call the police? -No. -Are you sure? That's my blood there. Calm down. Take it easy there. Well this wasn't suicide. Where is his shoe? -No idea. -Well he didn't come up here without it unless he hopped. It's around here somewhere. Are you alright? Find his shoe. And you, get cleaned up and talk to Gordon Ince. Gordon Ince was on remand for child abuse during his time at Shiellion. The line was that he was more penitent than his insane partner Marshall. And that Marshall had been the instigator. Ince had kept quiet about Shiellion for 15 years. But I felt that I had to try. For Jim's sake, and for Darren too. It wasn't just you and Marshall in Shiellion, was it? -There was a third man involved. -Getting desperate, eh? Yes. If you weren't, you wouldn't be trying to get me to talk. What is it about people like you, eh? I mean what motivates you? People like me ... You talk like I'm a different species. I'm the same as you, Inspector. I don't think so. How old is your daughter? -We're here to talk about you. -19? 20? Don't tell me you've never had thoughts. The trust in her eyes, the stirring in your loins ... at the sight of that blemish-free skin. Yeah, you've had thoughts, all right. Just like me. The only difference between us is I act on my thoughts. I'm more honest. We know that you're not the main leader, Gordon. -Marshall's told us. -Marshall's off his head. -He doesn't even know what day it is. -He's told us everything. -Made a very full statement. -Yeah, right. He even told me about the cop. -What cop? -The third man. -There's no cop. -Well Darren confirmed he's a cop. Then Darren lied. Very good. Very good. So why would Darren lie? You're a clever guy, Rebus. Why don't you work it out? So Jim Margolies wasn't the third man. I felt like a ton weight had just been lifted from my shoulders. But if it wasn't Jim, or any other cop, who the hell was it? We found the shoe, it was lying near the top. -Sand. Was that in his shoe? -Yeah. Last time he came back to his flat he had sand in his shoe. Could he have been to the sea? Or a kid's sand set, maybe? -Could be. What is that? -We found tire tracks. A full set of radials, pretty wide. 205s, maybe 10s. -A sports car? -Or a luxury job -I'm getting casts made up. -Good. Anyway, I've been through all those contacts, people who he met in prison, the lot. Nothing. And you know what? The guy had no friends. -He what? -It's pretty weird, he just didn't have any friends. He did have a friend. -You're the Bastard. -Slow down, you. -What do you want? -I want to speak to Billy. -What for? -Darren Rough's is dead. -Good. -The best news I've heard all day. -So Can I speak to Billy then? -He doesn't know nothing. -Well then you won't mind if I speak to him. -Go ahead. -He's upstairs. -Thank you. I need to talk to you about Darren. What did you two talk about? Did he ever...tell you anything? Not much. He just gave me comic books. Is that Judge Dredd? -Could do with him around here, eh? -He sorted out the bad guys from the good guys. Sometimes it's hard to tell them apart. I saw on telly, Darren's dead. -He is, Billy. -He said I had to give you this. -What's this? -He said it's from his home. It's from his home. It's from his home. Shiellion house became his home. I am writing this in case something happens... Ince and Marshall were both child abusers... The one who organized it all and kept it quiet was the medical officer, Dr. Joseph Margolies. From August 1987 until the time I left in May 1995 ... Margolies took part in the systematic abuse of me and numerous other boys. Ince, Marshall and Margolies were all present. The first attack on me took place in September 1987. This was repeated once or twice a week. It all started to make sense. Fifteen years before... Dr. Joseph Margolies had been chief medical consultant for all Lothian children's homes. Based at Shiellion, he had actually investigated claims of abuse. And given every home a clean bill of health. His word was law. Then a gap. Retired. Through health grounds... In the late 80s. Maybe people knew about the abuse. Maybe someone suspected it. It just seemed that they didn't care. Existence takes priority over essence, don't you think? I'm afraid I'm not with you, Inspector. In the sense that what we are is less important than the mere fact that we are, at all. -Sartre, wasn't it? -I'm a doctor of medicine, not a philosopher. It's just that the last time you spoke, at the funeral ... you put your children's suicides down to human nature. As I told you, at the funeral, that is my family's tragedy. Sartre's basic idea was that we have no eternal human nature to work on. That we're in a constant state of improvisation. Trying to work out, from moment to moment, what our appropriate behavior should be. -Sounds reasonable enough. -But your behavior in the past ... has been highly inappropriate, hasn't it? Take the death of your daughter, Sarah. Sarah took her own life. There is a history of suicide in my wife's family. There is no history of suicide in your family. Only abuse. Sarah took her own life to escape from you. Sarah was loved. -The children at Shiellion, loved. -They were used. And when your own son found out about it, he was so tormented with shame ... that he smashed his brains off Salisbury Crags. You don't know what you're talking about. There was no police uniform. Darren Rough was blackmailing you, threatening to name you in court. So you killed him. Didn't you? You can prove none of this. Oh, we'll prove it. We'll prove it. John, there's someone who wanted to see you. Thanks. I wanted you to have this, John. -Katherine... -Please, for me. It's what Jim would have wanted. Why did you lie about Jim's last night? I couldn't bear the children knowing the truth. Jim hid it well, but for months, he'd been having feelings... Thoughts about our daughter. When Darren Rough told him the truth about his father ... Jim finally realized what was happening. He was slowly turning into the same monster as his father. Jim killed himself to save our children. Barney and I are... I'll stay with Stuart for awhile, until I sort myself out. That sounds good. It's so cold, huh? I was just ... saying goodbye to a friend. Subtitles handmade by Diplomatic For addic7ed.com
