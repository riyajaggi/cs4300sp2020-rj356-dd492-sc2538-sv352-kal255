 Rebus (2000â€“2004): Season 1, Episode 4 - Mortal Causes - full transcript 
 The motto of the Scottish kings - Nemo mi impune lacessit ("Don't Mess With Me") sets the tone for this story. It's payback time for DI John Rebus in his pact with the crime under-lord Morris Gerald Cafferty for his finding the person who put Rebus' daughter in a life-threatening coma, the result of a hit-and-run accident. This time, it's Cafferty's illegitimate son who was "six-packed" and killed, and Cafferty is calling in his chips from Rebus. Rebus has to cope with a backdrop of gun running, jailbreaks, left- and right-wing extremists, nationalists and other splinter groups who are spouting racist philosophies, and imported white-power fanatics who are perpetrating hate crimes.

 Edinburgh - two cities. There's a city that you see that you know, and there's a city that you don't see that I know, the city under the streets, the one with the shadows and the darkness, the violence and the ghosts. GUNSHOT AND A SCREAM Mary King's Close - after the plague came, they sealed it off and carried on building right on top. Ghosts and all. GUNSHOT

 After the first two shots, did he think it was over? Because he was still conscious. Was he their enemy? Were they once his friends? Was he innocent or guilty? Did he deserve it? WHIMPERING Maybe at the end, he was just glad it was over. It's over. Hmm... What does it say? Memo, is that? I think there's an N...

 Nemo... Nemo... It sure looks like a message. He's the delivery boy. For pity's sake! Move them out of here! What are you doing? Get out! Bloody tourists(!) Where the hell's Curt? I want that boy down. So, what have you got? Not a lot. No ID. Caretaker found him. We don't know exactly when. What kept you? Late supper following a delightful evening at the ballet. Caro Rattray, John Rebus, detective inspector. I thought Caro would relish a small adventure. I doubt it. He's been six-packed. Talk to the caretaker again. Oh, yeah, sure. Shot in the ankles, knees, elbows... finished with a shot to the back of the head. Hung him from a butcher's hook to do it. Nasty... I want the boy down. I'm sorry, John, we'll have to wait till Templer gets here. God...! You OK? Yeah, I'm fine. He shouldn't have taken you down there. I just didn't expect so much blood. Yeah. They'll be putting up the price of a ticket. "Edinburgh's bloody chamber." Tourists will flock in. You can see the fascination. Dark, dangerous places, blood and death. It's a potent mix. Very sexy. It's sad and it's ugly. You only say that because you see it all the time. Most people don't. They don't understand. You need a taste of it so you know you're alive, don't you think? I prefer to get my kicks in other places. Really? Where would that be? I refuse to comment on the grounds I might incriminate myself. You should consult a lawyer. A good one. In fact... there's my card. Thanks for the tour, Inspector. It was marvellous. Rebus! Rebus! A bit out of your league, aren't you, Mhairi? I'll make a statement in due course. I heard they shot him in the cellar. Due course, Mhairi. You can wait with everyone else. Watch your back there. Ma'am. You can cut that out. I'm sorry I kept you waiting. Why was that, I wonder? This is DI Kilpatrick of the Scottish Crime Squad. Inspector Rebus. Nice to meet you. Why are Crime Squad taking an interest? Terrorist activity is part of my brief. He was six-packed, right? Jules Verne. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. Captain Nemo. I don't think HE did it. Glad we're agreed on that. What does it mean? A nickname? A gang word? Six-packed? Aye, ankles, knees, elbows. Irish terrorists use it as a punishment in extreme cases. Terrorists here? No... If it's an execution, you put one in the head. You don't waste bullets. Look at the venue, a butcher's shop in Edinburgh's plague street. This is melodrama, pure theatre. Somebody's making a point. Sometimes you feel better when the sun comes up. Sometimes you just feel cold and you can't shake off the ghosts. I'd not been round to see Janice in her new flat. I didn't like to ask myself why, so I took a peace offering. Breakfast? You took your time. You coming in or what? Don't pretend you're bashful. What do you reckon? Yeah, it's not bad. It's nice. It's a grubby wee hole, but it's cheap. It'll do better for a lick of paint. I'll give you a hand. I'm a dab hand with a brush. How's the university? Brilliant. It's even better than I thought. I cannae get over it. I'm that excited. I feel like ten years younger. I'll give you five. Oh, thanks very much(!) Have you seen Barney? We speak on the phone. What does he think? What does that matter? So, what are you now? Are you...? We're separated, heading for divorce. He'll get over it. What about us? What are we? Older? LAUGHTER It's good to see you. Siobhan, have they ID'd that body yet? No. Oh, Templer wants to see... John... can I have a word? (Kilpatrick.) Crime Squad will be leading the Mary King's Close murder enquiry. Martin and I have discussed it. Oh, really? My case? This may overlap with a number of our other investigations. It's mine. I didn't say taking over, I said leading. DI Kilpatrick is perfectly happy for you to remain on the case. But? With the more than reasonable condition that you report to him. You're free to make this a problem if you want to. I'll leave it in your hands, then. Sorry about that. Up to me, I'd have kept it informal. Listen, drop in later, meet the boys. Yeah, sure. SHE SNIFFS Look at you... Look, I'm sorry... but it's just we're in the dark here. What did your son do? Software. For computers. Coding web pages, Internet. He went to university. And who did he work for? All different companies. A freelance. He's very independent. Had he ever been involved in any criminal activity? Beg your pardon? Perhaps just got in with the wrong people? No. Absolutely not. He wouldn't do that. With respect, parents aren't the best judge. I'd know. I'm not naive. I know these things go on, but not Brian. Never. He wasn't brought up like that. SHE SOBS What about his father? He's dead. I'm sorry. Shot? Bri... Really? Wow... I mean, Jeez... Would you mind if we came in, Mr Murdock? Aye, sure. Aye. Come in. Who else lives here? Just me and Jools. That's my girlfriend. It's my flat, but I rent a room to Brian. How long has Brian lived here? A few months. What was he like? He was all right. He was a friend of a friend. I didn't really know him that well, but he was a nice enough guy. Who did he work for? I don't know if he was working. He was freelance. It was a quiet period. As long as he paid his rent. Did he have a girlfriend? Brian? No. He looks well-organised. That about sums him up. Shot, eh? Jeez... Lachlan? They didn't have any lights. What are you doing? Jools, these are the police. Brian's been shot. Like murder, you know? What? Don't be silly. He can't be. No, it's straight up. I'm afraid that is the case, miss...? Docherty. Jools. Excuse me. Charge it up. See if he's got any messages. OK. Thanks very much. We'll be in touch. That's the day he moved in. Can we take this? How did he die? I'd like to know. No, you wouldn't. While Siobhan went through Brian's papers, I took up Kilpatrick's invitation to "meet the boys." Quite a treat. The Smileys by name. Definitely not by nature. A pair of brothers. Very tight. Ken, the big one, like shaking hands with a vice. And Calumn, the comedian. I'll call you back. Hi, John. Hi. Thanks for coming. No problem. Guys, this is DI John Rebus. DS Ken Smiley, DS Calumn Smiley. All right? Yeah. Little and large, eh? You two would make a good windbreak. Don't bother. They're Fifers. Sense of humour bypass. I'm from Fife myself. There you go, then. Come in. So... why are you really interested in this case? Told you. Gun running. There's thousands of the things in Central Europe. All kinds of unpleasant people want to get their hands on them. Such as? All kinds, left wing, right wing, nationalists, splinter groups of all of those. There's a route taking weapons from the Balkans through Scotland to Northern Ireland, so if there's a hint of terrorist activity here, we're interested. I don't see this case as having an Irish connection. Fine. As far as I'm concerned, this is your case. All I'm asking is you keep us in the picture. Right? Remember your first girlfriend? Meeting her from school, hanging round acting casual, acting cool... but inside, a bag of nerves, shaking even sometimes. Never thought I'd feel like that again. Hi. All right? Yeah, yeah. Jeez! Here. You haven't changed a bit. Why don't you get me a glass of wine? That's hot. Make the most of this. I don't plan to get domestic with you yet. Yet? Not domestic. HE LAUGHS You haven't changed a bit either. EASY LISTENING MUSIC PLAYS DOORBELL RINGS If that's your mother... DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN I hope you've got nothing planned. There is a strong and powerful bond between a father and his child. To have that bond broken, to lose a son before his time... I nearly lost my daughter once. Sammy. I thought I'd go mad. Almost did. I wanted vengeance. I wanted to kill. Someone... Anyone... Blood is blood. And the bond of blood...is fierce. We got the name of Brian's father. He was very much alive. He was Morris Gerald Cafferty. It'll be good news at this time of night. Brian Cunningham. He's been shot. Murdered. Really? By who? I didn't know you had another boy. Now you know. Why the big secret? That was the way his mother wanted it. She did good by him. A good woman. Too good for you? You might say that. You must have kept in touch. 500 quid the third of every month. Regular. Separate account. That's the way she wanted it. He didn't know you? You never saw him? I could always pick him out in a crowd. (I used to...) I used to drive past his school. You know, when he was younger. Keeping an eye out. Who did it, Rebus? I came to ask you. Oh, if I knew, you'd have already found the body. Someone trying to get at you through him? No...I don't see how. It's between me and his mother. The only secret she ever kept for me. You find him, Rebus... You find the bastard. That's my job. No. No. It's more than that. You and me... Hmm? Fathers both. You never even knew the boy. Blood is blood, Rebus. For as in Adam, all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. But each in his own order. Christ the first fruits, then at his coming, those who belong to Christ. Then comes the end when he delivers the kingdom to God the father after destroying every rule and every authority and power for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death for God has put all things in subjection under his feet. Do you mind if I have a word? Why didn't you tell me? He sent me money. Hated him for it. But I took it for Brian so he wouldn't end up like him. Did anyone else know? Could anyone have found out? You did. If you can think of anything that might have got Brian into trouble... Goodbye, Inspector. You got anything to tell me, Rebus? The investigation's in hand. How's Sammy? Better. Glad to hear it. I'm sure you'll be in touch. The worst thing I ever did was letting Cafferty do me a favour. When my daughter Sammy was the victim of a hit and run, Cafferty found the boy that did it and delivered him to me. I wish he hadn't. I wish I hadn't asked him to. Now... I had to return the favour. Morning. Good morning, Inspector. Looking for a taste of danger? You said you had something to show me. This way. It's your turn for the mystery tour. What am I looking at? The motto, Inspector. It's Latin. Never one of my strong subjects. You see, Nemo... What does it mean? Call yourself a Scotsman? It's the motto of Scotland's kings. Whaud yuir meddle wi' me. Don't mess with me. Exactly. To my mind, that suggests punishment. Screw with me and this is what you get. Someone crossed a line they shouldn't have. It's a possibility. You could have given me this information over the phone. I had a mind you might be interested. I'm always interested in information. It doesn't come without a price. Always the lawyer. Excuse me. I'm a valuable source. I think you owe this source a drink. At the very least. I'll call you. Ciao. The Gar-B, another part of this city you never see - you don't want to see. The tour buses don't run round here. If they did, they'd never get out again. The Gar-B... I wasn't surprised she had to drag the kid back screaming. CAR ALARM SOUNDS HONKS HORN Oi! Police! Come here, you! Come here! Come here, you wee shite! You'd better run! Police. Open up. Are you OK? You all right? I didn't see anything! It's all right. I didn't even do anything! Are you hurt? Are you injured? He phoned back on Wednesday night, and I says, "No way, Friday night. I'm going down the Subway." Logan! Sir? Gar-B's in your patch, right? Aye. I'm looking for a wee ginger with a thing in his nose. A nose ring? That would be Jamesie. Jamesie...? McMurray. OK. Thanks. Morning. Oi! Get off us! I'll have you for GBH! Don't. I'll make it simple so you don't get lost. All you have to know is that from now on, you are marked. If you try anything like that again, if you so much as call somebody a nasty name, I will come down here, I will pull you out and I will deal with you personally. Have you got that clear? This is assault. This is harassment. Have you got that clear, James? You and whose army? You and whose army, big man? HE CHUCKLES DANCE MUSIC PLAYS Could someone get that? Hi. Everyone, this is John. John, this is Claire. Hi, Claire. This is Rachel and Ivan and Frances. Hi, Frances. And this is Christo. It's Chris really, but he looks that Spanish. I got you some flowers. I know. It's all he had. And some wine. So, when did you last use one of these? It was a... You're not exactly dressed for it. So what is this? Grab a granny night or...? Why don't you just lighten up, John? Huh? I love this song. Come on. Come on. Here. Oh, you're still working here, then? You're funny. What have you got? Brian's bank statements. He's a very tidy boy. He's got a spreadsheet to keep track of everything. He's got his current account, his business account, his savings account, although there's not much in that, and then, come here... there's this other one. Ta. Opened last week, but there's nothing in it. Expecting some cash. Maybe, but why open a second account? And see this? It's a flyer for a special night at the Crazy Horse. The what? The country bar he was in, you know, the night he was killed. I charged up his mobile. He'd got five messages - one from his mother and four estate agents said they had flats for him. Looking for somewhere to rent? Could be. No, he wasn't. He was looking for somewhere to buy. And despite having next to no money in his accounts, and not having worked in months, the deposit was, apparently, no problem. How much? Well, 10% on an 80 grand flat. At least Ã£8,000. Maybe his girlfriend was going to help him out. His girlfriend? Did you meet her? Yes. Nice girl. Would you recognise her if you saw her again? Mm-hm. Is that her? Jesus! I want to talk to you about you and Brian. I don't think I... Shall we go inside? It's all right, your boyfriend's not in. I was going to meet him down the Crazy Horse that night, but Lachlan came back early, and well... That's where it started, me and Brian. A bit of a laugh, really, at first, and it got to be more. You were sleeping with him, then? Yeah. Where? What? Well, I'm just thinking of the practicalities. It can't have been easy. I'm assuming Lachlan didn't know. We could shag on the kitchen table for all he'd notice. I was going to tell him, you know, when we'd found a place. No point being homeless. Where was Brian going to get the money? What money? For the deposit. Ten grand. That's what he told the estate agents. He owed that on his loan, so where was he getting the money? I don't know. He said he'd sort it. His family or something. His family? What, his father? I don't know. All I'm saying is he didn't say where it was coming from. What does it matter now anyway? Because...it might have been what got him killed. Had Brian done a job for someone and got paid in bullets? Was he trying to get smart with the wrong kind of people? His dad's kind of people. Maybe he got cold feet, tried to pull out. I'm looking for Frankie Bothwell. That's his office up there. Or maybe he just messed it up. Inspector Rebus. Frankie Bothwell. How can I help you? Er...is this one of yours? One of the theme nights. Rednecks. They go down a bomb. Cheap drink, band, wet T-shirts, tequila...punters love it. Were any of these people there? I'm probably not the one to ask. I don't spend too much time on the floor. You'd be better off asking the doorman or the bar staff. Leave it. I'll give it to Terry... PHONE RINGS Sorry, I'll have to take this. It never stops. I know the feeling. Aye? Really? What time is it your end? I didn't think Terry would be any more help than Frankie Bothwell. Sometimes, even I would have to admit Edinburgh looks good. But looks can be deceptive. Round here seems a long way from the Gar-B, a world away from Mary King's Close. but it's not that far. REPORTERS SHOUT QUESTIONS Mr Ahmed heard the noise, came out to take a look, they grabbed him on the stairs. You don't need to see it. Sometimes it's not what you see, it's what you imagine. And when you know what's happened, imagining is worse. Jesus...! They broke in after midnight, used the bed sheets to tie her to the chair so she could watch while they cut her husband to ribbons with knives and bottles. Her Scots-Asian husband... the Ahmeds. They'd live... but neither of them would be the same. It's a mess. I stopped a gang from the Gar-B the other day, laying into an Asian woman's car. Did you log it as racially motivated? No. I dealt with it. It was the Gar-B, you know? They hate everybody. An MSP... We're going to get taken to pieces over this one. Maybe we need it. Maybe. I'll see you back at base. OK. Hey, Rebus! Oi, you! Come back here! Spreading yourself a bit thin. Got to make a living. Out for your big break? It's all right. Aren't we all? He's giving it the old "isolated incident, "horrific but exceptional crime" story. No. You don't think this is a one-off, do you? Why shouldn't I? Well, because they've been attacked before - letters, parcels, threats. I know that. Mm-hm. So, what exactly are Lothian's finest actually DOING about the recent rise in racially motivated attacks? Race attacks? Look, I'm sure your chiefs would rather brush this under the carpet, but I thought you might have a different attitude. No? Right. It just goes to show you, then, doesn't it? See you, Rebus. The start of it. The start of what? I was missing something. I didn't know what, but I knew it was big and I guessed it was bad. Meantime, I had a call from Kilpatrick, and I needed to keep him sweet. He said he had a surprise for me. We impounded it last night. AK-47-Ms. Nice. They were hidden behind this false wall. Plenty of rounds, plus a couple of sniper sights to go with them. We were lucky. We got a tip-off. What about the driver? He's just a Mick following orders. He didn't know what he was carrying. He was supposed to drive to the port of Stranraer and phone for his directions for delivery from Belfast. Who to? I can guess, but that's the RUC's problem. So what's your problem? Well, the driver's in pieces. He'd wet his pants if you gave him a hard stare. We're going to switch drivers. Uh-huh. Who's in on it? Just me and the boys. What about Fettes? Templer? Security hasn't always been as rigorous as it should be, but we've had our fingers burnt in the past. Better a small team you can trust than a large one you can't. Right? All we need to do is track the load, make sure it reaches the ferry in one piece. But we could do with an extra man. For surveillance. Someone we can trust. Hmm. Sure. Hiya. You all right? I'm not going to make it. He's rearranged the seminar for tonight. Well, I've got to go out. You could come to mine later on. It's going to be a late one. You could let yourself in. I got a spare cut. Right. What's the problem? Nothing. It's a door key. I'm not asking you to marry me. I know that. So, what's the problem? There is no problem. Don't take it, then. I didn't say I wouldn't take it. Oh, for God's sake, John, what do you want? What do you mean? From me. Look, I've just split from my husband of 18 years. I'm not after a replacement. Well, not yet. I've got a bit of independence, and I like it. I'm not stopping you being independent. Oh, come on! You're acting like a teenager. You're all cow-eyed and lovesick one minute and huffy and jealous the next. I won't have it. I'm not asking you to. Fine. Janice! No. Look... Oh, shit. Janice... Och, go away! Fine(!) WHEEZING Evening, Mr Rebus. You can sod off for a start. Mr Rebus... What do you want, Weasel? Good news? Well, I've run a bit short of that. I'm sorry to hear that. Your arse. Take your hands off the car. I'm just making a polite enquiry. Mr Cafferty wants to be sure you still have the right priorities. He's not a man known for his patience. All right? Aye. You all set? Nae bother. You and Ken start now. Stake out the phone box. Make sure it's clear. What about you? I'll follow Calumn. It's the other end I'm bothered about. You never know who's watching. You all right, son? Oh, aye. Right, I'll see you in Stranraer. I'll find somewhere near a coffee stall, eh? You worked with Calumn a lot, then? Aye. Kilpatrick? Uh-huh. I could see tonight was going to be a bundle of laughs. PHONE RINGS Rebus. John, Calumn's lost me at traffic lights. Where are you? We're by the coffee stall. Which way is he coming in? The East Road. He's five minutes away. He's got to come right by us anyway. Ken's buying the coffees. Right. Milk and two sugars for me, mind. Kilpatrick wants a coffee. White...two sugars. They got separated at lights. He'll have to come past here anyway. PHONE RINGS That's Calumn now. Got yourself lost, did you? I was abandoned. There's a road block. I'll have to find a way round. No sign of the boss. Oh, it's OK. Here he is now. I'll see you in a bit. The road's blocked, but Kilpatrick's right behind him. That's mine. PHONE RINGS Yeah, we're getting you a coffee. Has he passed you yet? What do you mean? He's right in front of you. Eh? What are you talking about? What happened to you? He said something about a road block, road works. CAR DOOR OPENS Boss? PHONE RINGS Hold on. That'll be him now. I need help! He's got a gun. He's right behind me. Let's move it! Come on! Start the bloody car! Rebus? Next left. Turn left. Not you! Ken... Ken, where are you? 200 yards past the T junction. You can't miss it. Calumn? Calumn? Calumn! Smiley was six-packed, finished with one in the head. The same person who killed Brian Cunningham? We're hoping ballistics give us a match on the gun. How come I know nothing about your operation until the Daily Record informs me that it resulted in the death of a police officer? The point was to keep it tight to prevent leaks. You couldn't have failed more conspicuously. When did you get involved? This was my operation. I'm responsible. John expressed reservations from the start. But he went along with it. And didn't see fit to inform me. What about the weapons? Whoever they were intended for must have intercepted the van. Whoever? You mean you don't know who's got them? Murder and money. Murder and guns. Whoever killed Calumn Smiley killed Brian Cunningham too. They were violent, ruthless and they wanted to put on a show. They didn't just kill. They six-packed first. They left messages. They chose a tourist attraction as a killing ground. They wanted to make a point, gain attention, just like the bastards who tortured the Ahmeds. It made me think of Mhairi's growth industry. What did she know? And what in God's name was she doing here? â™ª At night he sleeps alone in your dreams â™ª Well, the smoke from the stands is blowing â™ª And it don't care where it's going â™ª The only time it feels right â™ª Is when he's ro-o-oling â™ª He's got a road map in his hand â™ª Gonna drive just as hard as he can... â™ª Do you mind if I talk to the little lady? I'm not your little lady! Night. What are you doing here? A big Kenny Rogers fan, me. What about you? I didn't see you as a cowgirl. Oh, aye. Country music, embodiment of the soul and all that. What do you want? Come here. What's this big story of yours and how is it connected to an attack on an MSP? And why should I tell you? Cos you're ambitious and you want a good story. All right... Calumn Smiley, the cop that was killed in Stranraer, his murder's linked to Brian Cunningham's. Do you really not know what's going on here? Enlighten me. Cheers. Right, the attack on the Ahmeds was just the first step, part of a plan. Have you heard the name Clyde Moncur? You've heard of the Ku Klux Klan? Pointy white hats, burning crosses? That kind of thing. Well, Clyde Moncur heads up a far-right group, the American National Heritage League. It's associated with the Klan, just as well organised, except they've got even more cash. Well, he got refused entry to the UK last year. Guess what he wanted to visit. Bonnie Scotland. They claim... burning crosses started right here in the old country, so they want to connect with their Celtic heritage. Their white heritage. They use the Net to publish and recruit. Small town Scotland, sink estates in the big cities, ripe for it. Places like the Gar-B? You heard about the White Thistle Brigade? They've already started to organise here, and guess who's got permission to visit. Mr Moncur. Some coincidence. Mhairi, darling, how are you doing? You had your hair cut? Suits you. Looks good. Oh, er...Frankie Bothwell... We've met. So how did you two get together? We're not TOGETHER. That's a relief. I wouldn't want to fight a policeman. So, what do you think? A good wee place, eh? Yeah, like a little bit of the Old South. That's right, my friend. There's a rebel in every Scotsman. We're all one under a Bonny Blue. The idea of Americans in pointy hats and bizarre costumes exporting racism to Scotland didn't seem like such a strange idea. After all, we've got strange costumes of our own. And we've got racists. We just... don't always want to see it. Hey, you, what's that? White supremacy(!) Go on, scram. See youse later. Come to say sorry? Who runs the White Thistle Brigade? No idea what you're talking about. Oh, really? I think you do. Who runs it? Naebody runs naebody round here, pal. This is the Gar-B. Yeah, I know where I am. I don't know you. Davie Soutar. Don't know you. Tell me about White Thistle. Never heard of that. What about Brian Cunningham? Rings nae bells with me. Best keep your eyes peeled, eh? SCRAPING Oi! Beat it. We've got a real problem with that round here. With what? Undesirables. Beat it before I kick your arse. Move it! So where does this Moncur guy come in? He's rich, he's a racist, he's organised... There's a bunch of extremists spreading their poison gospel in city schemes, and two days before he's due to fly in, a high-profile mixed-race couple are attacked in their own home. You don't think there's a connection? Not to Cunningham. Not to Calumn. What about the guns? What about them? Maybe it's the next stage. For schemies out Paki-bashing? I don't think so. All I'm saying is why not put a tail on him? I can get Siobhan to do it. No. No. I'll sort it. Ken maybe. He insisted on coming in. How are you doing? All right. You know something, don't you? Who was it? He was my wee brother! I never touched him! Ken, get off him! Smiley! Get off him now! All right? What the hell is going on? Have you heard? Heard what? Guns weren't the only dangerous things loose in Scotland. SCREAMING Couldn't be simpler. Down! Down! With planning... Don't look at me! ..timing... You, stay there! Don't move! Out of the van! Out of the van now! ..brutality... ..and the nerve to get away with it. WHOOPING If we don't beat him to Brian's killers, we'll find another body hanging from a butcher's hook. Siobhan... You want to do me a favour? Janice, it's me. Listen... Listen... About the other day... Are you going to say you're sorry? Well, no... I thought... You know, I mean... Janice? Scott, give us another when you're ready. PHONE RINGS Hello. Mine's a red wine. A nice wee red wine as well, please. Is this place dark and dangerous enough for you? It's not exactly what I had in mind. So what did you have in mind? Something a little more adventurous. Well, I'm the adventurous type. Really? Wait...wait, wait. What? I... Look, I don't want to do this. HE GRUNTS I know you do. No. This is a bad idea. It's just... It's a bad idea. What do you think you're doing? I'm going. Listen... Caro, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You have got to be kidding. How dare you! You bastard, Rebus! You arrogant little shit! Come on, ladies! Come on! You can walk me home. Don't be shy. Eh? No? Suit yourself. You're filth! Here's a message for you. Come on! Come on! Thanks for your help(!) CHUCKLING No bad for a man in his drink, eh? You got something for me? Hmm? What was Brian getting for the guns? I don't know what you mean. You expect me to believe that? REBUS YELLS I expect you to believe anything I tell you! Right? And I don't know anything about any guns. I kept out of Brian's life to keep him clean, right? Somebody got him dirty. I don't just want them dead. I want them skinned. I want them burnt and I want them exterminated. Now, you find them, eh? REBUS GRUNTS AND GROANS If I find them, I keep them. He stays alive. No. That's not the way it works out. You get that seen to, John. Who is it? It's me. Hiya. Oh, for God's sake...! I had a bit of...bother. Oh... Shit. I'm not your mother, John. Come back when you're a sight less pathetic. And minus that smell of whisky and that mingin' perfume. Good night, John. PHONE RINGS You know those days when you wake up and you wish you hadn't bothered? Hello? I got a call from Fort Apache. Jools Docherty was missing. "Don't come looking for me," she says. Why would she say that? She doesn't need to hide from me. Do you have any idea where she might have gone? I don't know. It doesn't say. I don't know. She didn't take all her stuff. She'll maybe come back for it. Yeah, maybe. Whose is the computer? It's Brian's. Brian's? He didn't have a phone socket in his room for the Net. They were never off it, the pair of them. I think we need a couple of teenagers. Any word on your friend Cafferty? No. Nothing yet. What's this you've got? Brian Cunningham's computer. Can't get in. Let me take it. I'll get the Crime Squad techies to crack it. Nah. Siobhan will be in in a minute. She says she can get past the login. It's your call. See what you can do, eh? Oh, come on, Janice! Think of it as an apology. Tea at the Balmoral. My treat. All right. See you about three, then. Oh, my, my... Why, thank you very much. Slainte. Bottoms up. Do you speak Gaelic? I'm afraid not. No. I'd love to meet a real Highlander. Well, this is as close as I get to the Highlands - Speyside malt. You wouldn't be Mystery Man, would you? Hmm? Clyde got a message to meet someone, but they didn't leave a name. Nothing mysterious about me, I'm afraid. Janice. Am I late? No, no. Janice, this is, er... Clyde and Eleanor Moncur. Pleased to meet you. So, are you on holiday? Clyde had a little business, but we've always wanted to visit, so... Clyde's family come from Scotland. Way back, of course. What kind of business are you in? Investment. I don't believe I caught your name. John. John. You staying long? We had planned a week, but it's so beau... We haven't yet decided. If you'll please excuse us, we have so much to see. It's been a pleasure. Entirely mine. The scones look good, eh? Next time you want me to provide you with a cover story, ask first. Jan, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... Listen, I don't want to get into it here, John. I just... I wanted to apologise. All right. Come round tonight. I'll cook. You bring the wine. We'll try and behave like we're adults, OK? Yeah, great. See you at eight. John who, exactly? What's your name, mystery man? What? I was just being friendly. We're famous for our hospitality. Is that the case? Let me tell you something. I'm a man who likes to make his own way, and I don't appreciate your kind of hospitality. Is that the case? Believe it, boy. I hope we don't meet again. I'm not the friendly kind. Nice to meet you. If you come this often, I can do you a member's rate. I don't think this is a club I'd like to join. Music not to your taste? Tell me about the Bonny Blue. Bonny Blue? Southern pride. It was one of the flags of the Confederate army in the Civil War. You know that one of course. The Old South... where women sip mint dewlips... and blacks... blacks knew their place. The Bonny Blue - it symbolised the South's unity of purpose in their lone stand. It's supposed to be based on the St Andrew's Cross. Scots settled lots of the Southern States. There's always been links. With the American National Heritage League for instance? Clyde Moncur, he's well-known for making stands in the Southern States. We should all take an interest in national heritage. Is that what the White Thistle's about? National heritage? What? I don't get you. I think you do. I'll be seeing you. Hi. Hi. White? Mm-hm. Listen, have I got time for a wash? Sure. Trying to impress me? Well, yeah. DOORBELL RINGS John, can you get that? Sure. Bastard! You bastard, Rebus! Jesus! God! What is it? Just paint. Do you have any turps or...? Mm-hm, under the sink. Who was she? What? The woman who's just left her mark, the one wearing the heels. Caro Rattray. She's a lawyer. I met her through... I think...she thinks... we're involved or... Are you? No. OK. Listen, Janice... nothing really happened. I said it's OK. I'll trust you. That's what adults do, then, is it? Mm-hm. And this is also what adults do. COMPUTER BEEPS Oh, shit! Any word on Jools? Uh-uh. See this? It's a special utility, a file shredder. Meaning? We can't recover files he deleted. He's got something to hide. What about the Internet? What's he been looking at? I can look at his browsing history. These are the sites he logged onto the day he was murdered. Sir... someone called Janice left a message. Can you pop round? That was it? What is that on your face? Nothing. Sieg heil! Seig heil! Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Did Brian have something on the leaders? Were they going to pay him off? Or was he trying to make them? Janice? Janice? You took your time. Where is she? She's at school. Nice-looking woman. You breathe in her direction... I've got no reason to hurt the girl. You're quite a hit with the ladies these days, aren't you? More than you can handle. Did you sunburn? Do you have a name for me? How would you feel if a black family moved in next door to you? Or Pakistani, you know, the new Scots? Oh, Rebus, I'm every man's neighbour. Till they get in the way. Have you got a name? Maybe it's one of your own guys getting ambitious, making deals behind your back, using Brian to make a point, to get guns, to get power. Shooting blind, Rebus. See, I know how to control my crew. You'd better look to your own. Now, you give me a name. Time's running out... and... thank your friend for the hospitality. "Look to your own?" Now, what did that mean? Where is she, Mhairi? Oh, my God! You frightened the life out of me. Not yet, I haven't. Jools Docherty, where is she? I don't know. Your number was in her room. You met her with her boyfriend. Remember him? The one that got hung on a butcher's hook. The one that died in slow, painful stages. He got out of his depth and died. He's not the only one out of his depth. What do you mean? Mhairi, they carved the man to pieces and forced his wife to watch. Jools could be next. Look, I can't start... If they get to her, it's down to you. Some people can handle that kind of guilt. Some people live with it every day. Not you, Mhairi. Where is she? Listen, Rebus, this could be very big for me. I need this story. What time are you meeting her? 15 minutes ago. Her car's already here. Just give us five minutes, yeah? What? What is it, Rebus? Is she all right? Oh! Oh, my God! Cheers. They were just a pair of kids. Fun, nice... good together, you know? It was Brian that told me about the White Thistle Brigade. Not everything, right enough. He liked having a big secret, feeling that he knew more than you did. It was enough to start me digging. What about Frankie Bothwell? I thought maybe if I could... I don't know... I could never prove anything, and Brian wasn't going to tell me. I should have told you this earlier, shouldn't I? Yeah. Yeah, you should have. We get 150 punters through that door. Of course I'm not going to remember them. What time did you leave for Dundee? Four o'clock. I was there when you called me. Who were you meeting? Clyde Moncur? Like I said, the name means nothing. I was holding auditions. What is this, eh? What's this? A hanging party? What's that? An historical document. Historical document? Some people collect stamps. I'm interested in the period. I'll bet you are. How long have you been running the White Thistle? We do line dancing here, not the Highland fling. If you want to charge me with anything... Charge you? Not that I don't trust you. KNOCK AT DOOR Can I have a word? It checks out. Dozens of witnesses. He was auditioning a band in Dundee. Shit! Then he got someone else to do it for him. Listen, Forensics found this in Jools's pocket. What is it? It looks like part of a web address. Oh, damn! What's up? It's a virtual drive. If you don't want someone to see files, upload them to here. No-one would know they exist unless you tell them. So if you're hiding information... Perfect. Password access only. I've tried the obvious - names, birthdays... What about the screamingly obvious? Nemo. No. What's the whole quote, the motto? Don't mess with me, ya bas. Brian was organised all right. He'd kept track of everything - the leaflets he'd laid out, the website they were planning, articles, recruitment plans... Oh, yes...he even had names. Well, well, well. Brian had all he needed to bring White Thistle down. Enough to make it worth trying to blackmail them for ten grand. Enough for them to shoot him in the head. Excuse me, where can we find Davie Soutar? Just in there. Cheers. In here? Mm-hm. John! John, be careful! Get away! Stop him! I'll go round the front! Stop that guy! Don't let him leave! Stop him! I've put a call out, the Gar-B. No, not yet. Shit! Cafferty was right, I'd been shooting blind. (OK, heads up.) (Here we go.) What's with the cloak and dagger? Got a lead on the guns? Er...maybe. Ta. I just wanted to run something past you. Mm-hm? What did your surveillance turn up on...er... Moncur? Nothing. A quick spin round the attractions, the castle, Calton Hill, a couple of museums. Your team weren't paying much attention. How do you mean? They missed me and Moncur having a wee drink. I'm not much of a tourist attraction. They must have missed it. You didn't put anyone on, did you? If you had, they'd have seen this. I put Siobhan on him. Well...security hasn't always been as rigorous as it should be. Has it? What are you saying? Calumn didn't know it, but he was making a delivery, wasn't he? Ken wouldn't have sold his own brother. I didn't tell anyone. Leaves you. Look, John... this isn't what it looks like. Now, look, Moncur is very wealthy. He's very influential... He could be useful to us. What it looks like is you being a racist bastard. No...no... I'm not a racist. So you're a fellow traveller? You share their goals. Their goals... REBUS LAUGHS What are their goals? A whiter Scotland? Wha's like us? It might not be the richest country, but we'll keep it white? Eh? Come on, I'm a policeman! Policeman(!) Come on, Rebus, you know the score. You see the figures. You know the streets. They brought the trouble with them. And your way of handling the trouble they bring is giving guns to people like Frankie Bothwell and Davie Soutar? It wasn't meant to go like that. They'd already cut the Ahmeds up! How far was it meant to go? I thought I could control it. You killed Calumn! You didn't pull the trigger, but you might as well have done. You sold him. You sold Calumn and Brian Cunningham and Jools Docherty. You sold your uniform. DOOR OPENS You've sold your soul. Bothwell got Davie to kill Brian when he threatened to expose White Thistle. That way, he could distance himself from it and he would have something he could use to control Davie. Was Calumn in on it? No. Davie wasn't meant to kill Calumn or take the guns. Tell us about Moncur. For Bothwell, it was about pride, the lone stand. He thought he was making a nation. Kilpatrick thought he was making cash. And Davie... Davie thought Jools was in with Brian, so he killed her at the Crazy Horse, planting his flag, his own Bonny Blue. I'm in control now. I can bring you Davie. Give me that. Gar-B Centre tonight. Eight o'clock. Davie was a bomb waiting to go off. Bothwell primed him, a display to impress the foreign money. Kilpatrick lit the fuse. You don't blame the bomb. You blame the people who made it. Oh! You got a name for me? Was I wrong to trust a policeman? Is that right? What do you know? I know that some wee scumbag from the Gar-B killed my boy. You know who gave him the gun, told him what to do, and sat and watched. I don't want to get someone killed on a hunch. Oh, your hunch is good enough for me, cos you know what it's like. I found the boy that ran over your Sammy. You didn't follow through. All I'm asking is you give me the same choice. It's family, Rebus. Blood is blood. Bothwell. Frankie... Bothwell. Blood... That's all it's ever about. I didn't have time to dwell on what Cafferty might do to Bothwell. I had to meet Kilpatrick. Get an ambulance down here right now. Oh, gee... You OK? It was Soutar. Yeah, I know. Where is he? GUN COCKING Behind you. Like I said, this place is crawling with undesirables. Get up. So what does that make you? That makes me the boss. Do you think I came alone? Do you think I really care? Move it. Why did you kill them? Cos I'm the man! Wee Frankie didnae understand that. All that white nation bollocks? This is Gar-B nation. My nation. All I need's a gun. Put the gun down! Armed police. SOUTAR LAUGHS Naebody messes with me! Armed police! Don't move! Are you all right? Yeah. Frankie Bothwell and Clyde Moncur dreamed of a white Scotland. Davie didn't care what Scotland was like as long as he was in charge. Davie was a monster, and once you've let the monster out of the box, you can't put him back. COUGHING You're a bigger fool than I thought, Rebus. What did you pull me out for, then? To stop you bringing out Moncur. Why should that Yank bastard get away with it? We're not finished. No. We haven't even started. You want something and to get it, you strike a bargain. HEART MONITOR BEEPS You make a deal. You make promises to the people you work with... ..to yourself... ..to your friends who trust you. MUFFLED GROANS BEEPING SPEEDS UP And you know that if you break your promises, if you break trust, you're going to have to face the consequences... MUFFLED GROANS RAPID BEEPING ..one way or another. CONSTANT TONE Oh... There's some promises you should never make... bargains you should never strike... All the same, some deals... are worth making.
