 Rebus (2000–2004): Season 1, Episode 1 - Black and Blue - full transcript 
 The first of the REBUS programs introduces the Scottish Detective Inspector John Rebus as he untangles the various strands of the interwoven web of criminal intrigues from Leith, Edinburgh to Aberdeen and Glasgow and points between. A serial killer of young women of the past, known as 'The Preacher' appears to have a copycat murderer dubbed 'The Disciple', who is repeating the modus operandi. But is it 'The Preacher' who has returned to continue his work of death? Or it is truly another serial killer at work? Intermingled with the workings of the CID Edinburgh to solve these problems, Rebus is pulled off the case to pursue a strange death of what appears to be unintentional suicide. This strand of the web takes Rebus through more suicides, murders, drug trafficking, money laundering, exposure of dirty cops and questionable liaisons between a couple of the suspects. The stressed-out Rebus manages to reach the centre of the web and skillfully gets the tangles sorted out in this fast-paced presentation.

 Who's for a wee drink, lads? 'And on the kind of Edinburgh night 'that makes Cowdenbeath seem like an attractive holiday destination.' 'We're nine weeks into the hunt for a killer. 'Nine weeks since a working girl from Leith 'phones her mum and tells her she's going to the dancin' with some guy. 'When her mum tells her to be careful, she laughs and says, ' "It's all right, Mum. He says he's a Christian." ' 'But he raped and strangled her. 'And left a biblical quote in her hand.' 'A rat shouldn't die in a place like this.' 'Her name was Judith Cairns.' 'Now we think he's struck again. 'Victim number two, in Aberdeen this time.

 'Mandy Strachan, 21 years old, identical MO.' 'Mandy and Judith. Judith and Mandy. 'Two young women, two shattered families, 'and the press loving every minute of it.' 'You know an investigation is in trouble when some hack invents a nickname. 'And they wonder why police drink.' Do you want to buy a radio, Rebus? What kind is it? What kind do you want? The kind that comes in its own box. Cheers, Kenny. Has Angie been in? I haven't seen her, John. It was me. What was? I'm The Disciple. I killed the pair of them. I picked the first one up on Lothian Road, got her drunk and brought her down here. Then I rode her and strangled her. I did that bird up in Aberdeen as well. I know the Bible off by heart. Old Testament, New Testament. It's all the same to me. 'Then I saw Angie. 'A success story. 'I'd got her off smack and out of a dodgy sauna.' Same again, Kenny, and a voddy and orange. 'But not off the game. 'I suppose two out of three's not bad.' There's no woman safe as long as the likes of me is about. If you're going to do it again, give us a bell first, eh? As if I'd tell you, you pig! I'm freezing! Hiya, Rebus. Hi. I got you one in there. Cheers. Check that tenner, Kenny? How are you doing? Oh, you know. God, I needed that. Sorry, Angie. You're out of luck. Another cheapskate bastard. Hang on, hang on. Put it in there. I'll get you a receipt. What did he look like? Tall, dark and handsome. I've been working since half one. Be careful, Angie. The killer paid the taxi with a dud tenner. Is it right he's done it again in Aberdeen? We don't know yet. We're going up there tomorrow. But you still think he's local? Aye. So watch yourself, eh? Oh, Christ. Here's the filth. Oi, I'm the filth. Not in here, you're not. Still with the juice church, Inspector? Yeah, I parked my wagon outside. Aye, well, I'm off. Wait a minute, your receipt. Twenty? Keep an eye out for any funny characters. The only sort I know. Can I tempt you, Jack? Three years, four and a half months. I'm two and a half minutes, Kenny. A suspect you've had dealings with is alleging I hooked him. Does the suspect have a name? Mental Minto. Oh, Jack! Watch yourself. He knows more law than the Procurator Fiscal. Will you have a word with him? I'm busy. You're not going to ask me if I did hit him? The Disciple's not in. I'm collecting for Oxfam. Well, I gave at the office. The maid's day off? That's unlawful entry, by the way. I've always felt that Black And Blue lacked the lyrical potency of Exile On Main Street, while never plumbing the emotional depths of Gimme Shelter. It was either that or the Prokofiev, eh? You've upset a colleague of mine. Your colleague upset me. No, he didn't. I was there. Of course. So you were. Do you not remember? I called in on a tip-off, looking for drugs. Yeah, and I found some as well. He never touched you, right? How do you sleep at night? Like a baby. He never...touched you. Rebus? 'And I looked at my reflection and I thought, ' "Do I know you?" ' Well? Sorted. Thanks, John. I'll see you. Do you not want a lift? I need the exercise. DOOR CLOSES 'Mr Rebus, it's the Central Library here. 'You still have out on loan, 'The Preacher: Killing For Jesus by Ian Daly, 'A Portrait Of Evil by Angela Fry, 'and New Town: Edinburgh's Biblical Murders by Catherine Carruthers.' 'Please return them as soon as possible.' BEEP 'The Disciple. 'They called him that because he's a direct copycat 'of the most evil killer we'd ever seen in the streets of Edinburgh.' 'Deja vu, 15 years back. 'The Preacher, a scripture-quoting killer, 'murdered three Edinburgh women, then vanished without trace. 'Description - about 40, shy, 'neat and tidy.' 'He takes souvenirs, like The Preacher.' 'Leaves biblical quotes, like The Preacher.' 'Old Testament, of course.' 'Every night I go home and go through all the old stuff again and again, 'looking for a link between the past and the present.' 'Then, 'and now.' 'But however hard I look, it's never there.' ICE IN GLASS CLINKS BEEP 'I'm not in. Leave a message.' 'Rebus, it's McCaskill. Pick the phone up. 'Pick the phone up! It's about Lenny Spaven.' Yeah, boss. Lenny Spaven. He'll be telling you he's innocent again. He's what?! Lenny! Lenny, it's me, John Rebus. Rebus? Where's that toerag Geddes? He's retired to Spain, Lenny. You're a lying bastard. He lives right here in Edinburgh. Forget Geddes. I'm here. I want you up here now! Or he's dead. Braw morning, eh? Lenny, we can sort this out. You bastards had 15 years to sort this out. I didn't kill Elsie. I loved Elsie. Let's just go down and we can talk about it. You don't get it. I done nothing. I killed nobody. And you and your boss Geddes framed me. Do you believe in God, Lenny? What? God. Do you believe in him? God didn't get me up here. It was you and Geddes. I'm at the end of the road here. I've had it. I believe in God. I mean, I really believe. In the name of God and his only son, we never fitted you up. You're a liar, Rebus. Whoever killed Elsie Rind is still out there and you let him go. Take the rope off his neck, Lenny, eh? Please, take the rope off. I'll give you something to pray to your god about. I damn you to hell, Rebus. I damn you to the hell that I've lived in for the past 15 years. Lenny! 'Lenny Spaven was finally free 'but he'd left me in a dark pit. 'There was only one person who could get me out of it. 'Lawson Geddes, my old boss.' 'Lenny was right. I had lied to him. 'Geddes was a lot closer than Spain. 'If Fairmilehead was an attitude it would be smug. 'If it had a vice it would be hypocrisy. 'There's more pampas grass than Argentina 'and it's only three miles from Craighill Jail.' Oh, John, John, John. He damned me, Lawson. He damned me to hell as he died. Come in. I've done the sausages the way you like them. I've just seen Lenny Spaven's brains spread over half of Craighill. The bastard didn't deserve to live this long. How can you be so sure? Look at me. Look at me. Lenny Spaven was as guilty as sin. He killed Elsie Rind and we proved it. We did the right thing. OK? OK? Yeah, OK. Eat your breakfast. APPLAUSE You made it, then. I thought you were scared of heights. Are you OK? It was on the telly. Anything to get off this bloody case. I got another counterfeit tenner. I'll check it for fingerprints. I thought I missed the briefing. Cancelled. Miss Bond, we go in one minute. I'm sorry you got landed with Spaven. Forensics confirm it. The Aberdeen murder was carried out with the same rope. This copycat is on the move. When am I going up there? Aberdeen want us to hold back for a couple of days. How can we coordinate the investigation if no-one's there? The Aberdeen murder is a tragedy, but it's one step closer to nailing this bastard. We're now sure he's a Leith man who travels. So, Ormond. Boss. Check up on locals who travel to Aberdeen. Drivers, delivery men. Oil workers. McClean's team. Yes sir. Re-interview witnesses on the basis of this new piss-poor e-fit. Most importantly, we now have a matching note found by Aberdeen police in Burke's club. That's the place where Amanda Strachan was picked up. He used the same machine to copy the biblical quotes. Smith, follow up on the photocopier lists. If he's still on our patch, I want US to lift him. Go! What about my team, sir? How are you feeling? Yeah, OK. I went to see Geddes. He sorted me out. Look, send me to Aberdeen. I don't know how to say this that won't hurt. You're off the investigation. I'm what? As of now. I'm sorry. The Chief Constable has launched an inquiry into Spaven's allegations. He says The Disciple's too high-profile a case for an officer under investigation. Tell him I'm staying on the case. They wanted me to suspend you. Do you not see how deep you're in here? They want to make a clean sweep of the Spaven case. With Geddes retired, there's one serving officer left to get. You! Chief Inspector Templer has got... Templer? CHIEF INSPECTOR Templer has carte blanche to get to the bottom of Spaven's allegations. So what am I supposed to do now? You wait for a call from Templer. That's it? Paid holiday? To hell with that. There's been an incident in Leith. Check it out. I'm off the case. Keep me posted about that tenner, eh? Aye. PHONE RINGS All right, sir. It's just round the corner. 'So there I was, sidelined to investigate pond life in Leith.' THIS is an "incident"? Who found the body? Me, sir. WPC Logan. What's the odds? Alkie commits suicide? You better get used to that uniform, Logan. His arms are taped to the chair. Unless he's got a prehensile tongue, I'd say he had some help. Besides, he's a Catholic. Suicide is a mortal sin. Whose is the flat? An Alan Mitchison, sir. He's not in. No. He's down here. Over here, sir. Mmm-hmm. Leaned out to survey his handiwork. Get a match on them as soon as. Sad bastard, eh? It takes all sorts. He liked his curries. The lady next door says he came home in a cab last night with two men. Strangers. One of them a big bloke with a bag. And the other? Well, she never seen him. Talk to her again. What's 01224? Aberdeen. 01224, Aberdeen. My brother lives there. PHONE BEEPS Hello, this is Burke's club. Hello, sorry. What? This is Burke's club, Aberdeen. How can I help you? Hello? 'Hello?' Hel-lo? 'Who is this?' Siobhan. Do me a favour. Let me see all the Aberdeen statements. From Burke's club? There's damn all in them. Nobody saw anything. Just... Anyway, I thought you were off this. Background. 'A Leith oil rig worker continually phones up the nightclub where the latest victim was picked up, 'then winds up dead himself. 'It could have been a coincidence, 'but as a general rule I don't like coincidences.' FAX BEEPS 'Then the fingerprint match came through.' Tony Kane. Hello, Tony. 'Tony Kane was hired muscle, 'the kind of guy who'd break a lad's legs for ã500, 'and throw in the arms for an extra 50. 'But when I looked, Tony Kane had become the Invisible Man. 'Not on any lists, credit cards, 'voting rolls, bank accounts, nothing. 'So I paid a visit to his former employer, 'the biggest heroin dealer in Edinburgh, Joseph Toal.' 'Toal was untouchable, allegedly. 'A king rat who'd fought his way to the top in his youth 'and now paid men like Tony Kane to do his dirty work for him. 'And his work was very, very dirty.' I'd like to speak to your father, please. What about? I'd rather talk to him personally, if you don't mind. Please excuse Stanley. He's not been the same since his mother died. So, what can I do for you? I need a favour, Mr Toal. I'm looking for Tony Kane. Bastard thing. What's Tony done? An Alan Mitchison was murdered in Leith. We've put Tony Kane and an accomplice in the middle of it. He's going down, Mr Toal. I haven't seen Tony Kane in 12 months at least. I believe he used to work for you. He left the firm in a bit of a hurry. I'll tell you what, if you find him I'd be grateful if you told me first. I mean, I am a generous man to my friends. Dad, have you got the keys for the 911? Don't ask me, I never get to drive it. You'll have to get the keys off Eve. Hey, Stanley, son, Mr Rebus here was wondering, have you seen Tony Kane recently? Tony? No, Dad. To hell with it. Fancy a drink? No, I'm teetotal. There's Rico now. I'll get it. Ah, cheers. Have you ever come across Tony Kane? I keep my nose clean, Mr Rebus. Rico, my darling, I don't want you to keep your nose clean. I want you to sniff about in the shite like you always do. Cheers, Kenny. Find Tony Kane for me. There's a 50 in it for you. 50? Fine, that'll do me. Good man. 'Then I got a call from Academy Row, headquarters of the Edinburgh police force. 'More skeletons than cupboards to hide them in.' 'Very stylish cupboards, though.' 'Tell them we don't want disturbed.' Ah, DI Rebus. DCI Templer. We've met before, haven't we? Promotion board, two years ago. That's right. Applying again? Well, I've still got an attitude problem. Look, will this take long? I've got better things to do than jump through hoops for a publicity stunt. This is no stunt, Rebus. This is an official investigation into the death of Elsie Rind and Leonard Spaven's subsequent conviction. I want to start with the murder of Elsie Rind. It was a long time ago. Then I hope you have a good memory. DOOR OPENS DI Morton is assisting me on the inquiry. Do you two know each other? Inspector. Elsie Rind's body was found in a field outside Haddington. My sergeant... Lawson Geddes. Yes, Sergeant Geddes. He strongly suspected her boyfriend, Lenny Spaven. But it was all circumstantial. We had nothing hard. Until you searched the lockup. Yes. For the second time? Yes. So, let me get this straight. You went over Spaven's lockup, found nothing. Went back a week later. Found the victim's bloodstained handbag with Spaven's fingerprints all over it. Yes. A bit convenient, wasn't it? It's what happened. Mmmm. What did Lenny Spaven say to you before he died? He said he was innocent. What do you think of that? Every jail in the country is full of innocent men, eh? Are you in the habit of planting evidence? No. Does this mean anything to you? Martin Minto. He has accused you of threatening to plant stolen property on him. Did you do that? I've said all sorts of things to criminals. Did you do it? Are you enjoying this? Not at all. Lenny Spaven was guilty. I hope so. Interview terminated at 16:40. We must do it again some time. We are. I've scheduled a week of interviews. You've what? I'll confirm the time of tomorrow's meeting later. I've got a job to do. I'm in the middle of a murder inquiry. So am I. Criminals love seeing cops turn on each other. Do you realise that if Spaven was innocent then the real murderer is still out there? Do you mind opening your briefcase, sir? How long do you plan to visit Scotland for, sir? Er...three or four weeks. What is the purpose of your visit? Business and a little pleasure. Enjoy your stay, sir. Amen to that. Hello there. Hey, how are you? The sunburn is killing me. Aye, glorious, eh? Hey, hold that. What's up with you? Can you spare a minute? So did you fit this guy Spaven up? No. What are you worried about, then? Oh, it's my old boss, Geddes. I think I might have been a part of something. Look, forget I said that. You're a bloody mess, man. Oh, gut ache. It's this bloody job. You're so full of crap, Rebus. Oh, is that what it is? If you want a new job, have mine. Get off. I'm saving the whore-with-a-heart stuff for my memoirs. You know they say fish have a memory span of three seconds. That's kind of nice, eh? Er... Hello, this is, er...Willie Turner, Edinburgh City IT unit here. Tell me, is Jimmy Constable still working there? No. Could I speak to your gaffer? Oh, good, good. The thing is our system has crashed. Yet again, yeah. Bloody typical. I have three Superintendents and an ACC breathing down my neck. We tried that. Yeah, we tried that. Our password is locked up in the encryption file on the mainframe. So I'm sitting here like a spare prick at a... Exactly! Oh, good. I'll just get... Get a pen. Hi, yeah. Fire away. Listen, you're a scholar. I owe you. Yeah, bye. HE TYPES Hello. Rebus, where the hell have you been? I need those Aberdeen statements back. Yeah, right. Er... Sorry. You were right, there's nothing in them. I got a match up on that tenner you gave me. This was photocopied on the same machine as the tenner The Disciple spent in Burke's club in Aberdeen. I told you, I can't remember. I try to put their faces out of my mind. I'm doing my best. Anyway, I thought you were off this case. He is. If you think of anything, you let us know, OK? Don't blame me. I'm not. Who's Tony Kane? Why? Because Rico Briggs has found him. You want me to bite it or shake it? I want you to fill it. Tony Kane is up north. What, Fife? No, no. Aberdeen. Aberdeen? Are you sure about this? Aye. I couldn't get an address. All right. Thanks, Rico. See you later. Three things, son. First thing is I'm a journalist. Second, I'm not going to ask you to do anything illegal. What's the third thing? How would you like to make ã500? 'Mr Rebus, Central Library here. 'Your books are three weeks overdue. Another borrower has requested them. 'Can you please return them as soon as possible?' BEEP 'DCI Templer here. 'I'm just confirming that tomorrow's interview at 9:30 will take place as arranged.' BEEP Yes! So, what have you got for me? Er... These borrowers conform to the lending pattern you asked about. Only two. Yep. They both had out all the books on The Preacher murders, plus all the contemporary newspapers too. They must be experts, eh? Detective Inspector John Rebus. Yeah. He's read everything we've got at one time or another. And this man here. Mr Manuel. Peter Manuel. Do you know him? Know him? He killed upwards of a dozen people in the 1950s. Well, he's been borrowing a lot of books. I doubt it. They hanged him in 1959. What? It's an assumed name. But he's left his address. In Aberdeen. 'The same questions kept spinning round again and again in my head. 'If Tony Kane lived up in Aberdeen, who paid him to come down and kebab Mitchison on railings in Leith? 'And where did Burke's club fit in? 'And was there a connection with The Disciple killings? 'Whatever the answers, the more I thought about it, 'the surer I was that I was heading in the right direction.' Inspector Rebus. Superintendent Grogan. Pleased to meet you. Welcome to Aberdeen. I've allocated you DI Lumsden. He's on The Disciple case at the moment. If you need anything, just ask him. Thank you. Ian Lumsden, John Rebus. Hi, John. I believe you're investigating a murder. Bloody hell. Alan Mitchison, 23. He's a roughneck for T Bird Oil. Dear, oh, dear. And you think the suspect lives up here? One of them. He's a hammer man called Tony Kane. We don't have an ID on the other. Tony Kane? No, I don't know the name. No? Used to work for the biggest dealer in Edinburgh. I could ask the Drug Squad boys. You can go through the local files. Amanda Strachan. Yeah, poor sod. That's the murder locus. Pilsmuir Park. The Park View Hotel. Was The Disciple a guest? I went through the last three months' guest lists. Nothing. Could he be an oil rig worker? Are you saying the Mitchison enquiry's connected to The Disciple? Well... I'm not sure about anything yet. Well, keep us informed. So, what do you need first? Those Drug Squad files and I need a room. No worries. It's all sorted. Any food, just charge it to the room. Our guest. Yeah, right. No, seriously. No drink though, that's down to you. So what's first? I thought I might look at these files, then visit Mitchison's employer. OK. Listen, er... a couple of the guys are going over for a few beers at eight. I thought I might go to Burke's. Burke's? Why? Alan Mitchison phoned there a lot. Oh, did he now? All right. I'll take you there tonight. I'll give you a call. Smashing. See you later. Bye.

Someone in the job is supplying info to the dealers. Am I missing something here? We don't need you marching through town in your size 10s. I'm investigating a murder. And your prime suspect is dead. Two men attacked Alan Mitchison. He's not up here or in Burke's club. I appreciate you've got problems, but for God's sake, if you do any more, work through us. I'll walk. Don't you go rattling any cages, Rebus. 'Joanne had lied to me about knowing Mitchison. 'Now I had to find out why. 'The trouble was, I'd lost my way.' Are you looking for business? I'm looking for Down Street. You're nearly there. It's just up round there to the left. Cheers. Have you not got your winter woolies on? It's a hot water bottle we need. I'll bring you one next time, eh? You'd be cheaper staying with us. Oh, I know, I know. All right, darlin'? 'Joanne had gone, 'and in a hurry.' 'Everything led back to Burke's.' PHONE RINGS John? What's going on? Templer's going ballistic. 'Hold her off, Jack. I need 24 hours.' I can't do it. The guy I came up here for, Tony Kane, is dead. 'Your career is dead if she catches up with you.' Yeah, I'll handle that. Listen, Jack, do you know what Joe Toal's wife looks like? Eve? 'Yeah.' Blonde, 30-odd. Could pass for 25. 'A real looker. Why? 'John? 'John!' 'Stanley was screwing his stepmother on away days in Aberdeen. 'If they were running a freelance drug deal up here, 'it was a dangerous game.' 'And then it hit me.' Owww! Who do you think you're dealing with? Some wet-behind-the-ears pusher? You better calm down. I've never been more calm. This is for you and everyone else. When I come back up here, I'll be team-handed. You are going nowhere. Yeah, right! Where were you between the hours of 8 and 9:30 last night? Being beaten up. By whom? I don't know. And didn't you report it? My business is in Edinburgh. Never mind Edinburgh. You're in deep shit. If I wanted, I could stick you in deeper. Is that right? Yes, it is. I've spoken to your gaffer and he says you're off The Disciple case. So? So... You can't stay away from prostitutes, can you? What? Your description matches that of a man given to us by a witness. A witness to what? Does the name Vanessa Holden mean anything to you? No, it bloody well doesn't. Either get me a lawyer or let me go. DOOR OPENS I think you'd better sit down. NEWS: Police say the copycat killer, The Disciple, has struck again. The victim, 24-year-old prostitute and mother of two Vanessa Holden, was last seen alive in the docks area about 8:15 last night. Grampian Police say a man is helping them with their inquiries So they've got him. PHONE BEEPS Hello. Could you put me through to whoever is in charge of The Disciple case? Mmm-hmm, thank you. Hello, Ken Mapping here at the Procurator Fiscal's. Er... No, it's only my second week on the job. But the phone is red hot with this business of the murder arrest. Apparently he is the nephew of a high court judge, Lord Beattie, who's just been on the phone to me in a very distressed state. We are talking about a Ronald Andrew Shade here, aren't we? John Rebus? Are you certain about that? No, no, I probably made an error. I'm sorry. Oh, strictest confidence, old son. Yeah. Bye. John Rebus - what the hell do they have on him? She was strangled with the same rope? You tell us. Where's Grogan? At the murder scene. I need to speak to Grogan. If The Disciple has killed again, he's broken the pattern. Pattern? You really are out of it. You need help. Drinking, paranoid delusions. Everybody's wrong but you, eh? You arsehole! As long as I'm in here, the real killer is out there somewhere. Isn't that what Lenny Spaven said? Give Jack the keys. I'm not a child. I got you out of there. Ach, they didn't really want me. Yes, but I do. In. 'So, Lumsden had succeeded in getting rid of me 'and Templer couldn't wait to get me back to Edinburgh.' I'd nothing to do with this, John. Just like you had nothing to do with Mental Minto. She's got us both by the short and curlies. Minto was on to her like a shot when he heard about the investigation. Look, you can trust me. Trust? I've been buttered up, beaten up and fitted up by Lumsden. Meanwhile a woman was murdered. Lumsden's bent? As a ã6 note. Can you prove it? What do you think? Now you screw me over a case that happened 15 years ago. I don't trust anyone any more. Listen to me, John... No, you listen. If you want more on Spaven, talk to Lawson Geddes. We can't. Of course you bloody can. John, Lawson Geddes has disappeared. You're all we've got. What is it with this Boy Scout vow of silence? I've told you everything. Don't insult my intelligence. Geddes has left you hanging out to dry. Not true. You're on your own here. It's time you looked out for yourself. Now, for the last time, why was Lawson Geddes so obsessed with sending Spaven down? Why? HE SIGHS He knew Spaven from before. Before the Elsie Rind murder? They were in the Army together in Malaya. They were in this church group. They had a real falling out. Over what? Over what? Geddes believed Spaven had got away with a murder. Literally? Yeah. A local girl, prostitute. That was all he told me. Geddes really believed that Spaven had done it. And you've deliberately held this back? Why? I thought it would look bad for Geddes. It looks bad for you, Rebus. Geddes is a good man. Sometimes good men do bad things, isn't that right, Inspector? At the end of the day, I trust Geddes, you don't. That's the bottom line. Are we finished? For now. If Geddes contacts you, refer him to me immediately. Inspector? Interview terminated at 12:10pm. Are you seriously following me about? 24/7. I hate this as much as you. Did you leave this car door open? No. Rico? Get me out of here. What the hell are you on? Get me away from here. For Christ's sake, now! You can get up now. So talk to me, Rico. Make me feel wanted. I know who murdered Alan Mitchison. The second man? Who was it? Can I talk to you alone? You never told me it was heavy, Rebus. So who was the second man? I'll deny it. I won't testify. These folk kill witnesses. Who was it? Stanley Toal. I might have known. You're sure, yeah? I'm sure. Some cop in Aberdeen wanted Mitchison shut up. So Stanley and Tony obliged. I don't know who the cop is. No, but I do. What the hell's been going on? You don't want to know. But your face? Police brutality. Did you get anything on The Disciple? Eve? It's John Rebus. I know about you and Stanley. 'I want you and Stanley at this station at 2:30.' Who's that? My secret lover. 'If you don't show, your husband gets told everything.' Right. Bye. I'm off to Mum's. She's not feeling too well. Fine. No Stanley? He'll be here in half an hour. I want to do a deal. You don't have any cards, Eve. You and Stanley ripped off your husband in Aberdeen. I know Stanley killed Tony Kane. Well, can you prove it? We'll get him for laundering drugs money. Along with you. I can go one better. I can get you Joe. Why would you grass up your own husband? Oh, grow up, Rebus. He'll kill me when he finds out about me and Stanley. And I mean kill me. I can get you dates, places, names, the lot. I want more than Joe. How about Lumsden? In return for what? Keep Stanley in here while I get to the bank. And then let me walk. You can't disappear if you're a witness. I won't be a witness. I'll get Stanley to talk. You give me ten minutes alone with him. No way! What do you take me for? He'll torture us. He'll mark my face and he'll kill us both. You're setting us up. It's our only chance. If Dad finds out about us, we're dead! Then give them Lumsden. But let's get the hell out of here. That's all they want. The bent cop. It was Lumsden. Go on. Lumsden squared things with the Aberdeen drugs squad for a price. But then Mitchison's girlfriend... Joanne. Aye. She sees Lumsden being paid off at Burke's club and tells Mitchison. And he tried to blackmail Lumsden. Check. So Lumsden got me and Tony to give him a fright. Just a fright, mind. So what went wrong? That prick jumped out the window. It wasn't our fault. A matter of opinion, Stanley. Then what? Then you turned up in Aberdeen, asking awkward questions. Lumsden was shitting himself. Said it was a matter of time till you got hold of Tony and made him talk. So Lumsden wanted Tony kept quiet. Aye. Lumsden said he could make it look like suicide. What do you know about the murders of Amanda Strachan and Vanessa Holden? What? Nothing! Naebody knew nothing. We just used Burke's for pay-offs. So Mitchison's death was unconnected with The Disciple? Are you kiddin'? Guys like that are shot. I would never harm a lassie. Never! OK. Well, that will do for just now. Interview terminated at 18:33. Listen, my dad's not going to find out about this, is he? Nah, don't worry. We'll look after you. Thanks, both of you. You've been very helpful. Eve, you'd better go. What about me? You're not leaving together. I don't want anybody to know about this yet. This way. Will you come with me, please? Tell me Rebus, what makes somebody want to be a pig anyway? Oh, it was definitely the company. Oh, oh! Stanley Toal, I charge you with the murder of Tony Kane. You don't have to say anything cos you've already said it! Agggh, you're dead! Take him away. Agghhh! Rebus! What are you doing? Aaaggh! So how did he take it? Yeah, he was quite philosophical. We'd better get you disappeared for a couple of days. Come on, get in. So...how did you end up with a bunch of gangsters like the Toals? The usual. Fear, greed. A bit of bad luck. VOICES AND LAUGHTER Where are we going? Ssshh! What? I must have left the light on. You're more wound up than me. Do you want a drink? Well, I wouldn't want you to feel obliged. Who's this? That's my daughter. She's with her mother. My son is with his father. So, was that your "bit of bad luck"? Well, the start of it. After I had my son it was either work or starve. So I worked. I started out as one of Joe's girls and then became THE girl. And now? I'm not a girl any more. I'm just scared of him. I feel like I've spent half my life dealing with men that scare women. Cheer up. You solved your case, didn't you? I solved A case. Where am I sleeping? Through there. And what about you? I'll take the chair. OK. Eve? That night in the hotel bar. Was it a coincidence you were sitting there? I'm not a great believer in coincidence. Are you? Eve? DOORBELL RINGS John, it's Lawson Geddes. Hello, John. I was obsessed with pinning the Elsie Rind murder on Spaven. Not just because he killed a girl in Malaya. There was something else. What? I thought... I thought Lenny Spaven was The Preacher. You what? When I nailed him for the Elsie Rind murder, I didn't care. I'd got him. The Preacher. Life! After you left, I looked through some of my old papers. Look at this. I haven't seen it since it was taken. If it wasn't Spaven, there was another guy. Another Scot in the Bible group. A real whizz kid with electronics. His name was Ry... Ryan Slocum. 'Ryan Slocum, Directional Drilling, Houston, Texas.' You know him? I met him, yeah. 'You're up here on this murder case.' 'Ryan Slocum.' 'Murder case. Ryan Slocum.' Ryan Slocum killed Elsie Rind and planted the evidence to frame Spaven. Spaven was innocent. And Ryan Slocum is The Preacher. I just couldn't see it. You're going to have to speak to Templer. You're going to have to show her this. You have to show her this and tell her. I'm taking it there now. I just wanted you to know first. Well, look, I'll come with you. No, it's OK. I'll go. PHONE RINGS Come on. Come on. PHONE RINGS PHONE CONTINUES RINGING PHONE RINGS Yeah? 'Rebus? It's Siobhan.' I'm at the Cowgate. We need you for an ID. Who? Who is it? Are you OK? Where is it? This way. Yeah, that's the body of Angela Riddell. And it's the same MO? We're not sure what's missing, though. Was there a jade necklace? She always wore it. How long had she been in the water? They reckon three days, John. We'll deal with it. You and the Aberdeen mob couldn't find your pricks in the dark. Come on, John. Oh, I need a drink. Caledonian Mud Engineers? Hello, I hope you don't mind me phoning. This is Alec Curry from Chrome Fabricators in Aberdeen. Could you send one of your salespeople to have a word with us the next time somebody's in our area? That's right, Aberdeen. Chrome Fabricators. Thank you. Who would that be? Paul Martin. Uh-huh. I couldn't phone him at home, could I? No, no. It's OK. Yeah, right. Bye. MEOW Who's a good girl? Come here. ANGIE: 'I've taken care of myself since I was 15.' 'I'm fine.' PHONE RINGS ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS 'I'm not in. Leave a message.' 'Mr Rebus, this is Central Library here. 'A borrower has been looking for your books for some time now. 'The fine to date is ã9.50. Please return the books as soon as possible.' BEEP That's him. He was interested in anyone who'd borrowed books about The Preacher. And had they? Some guy had used an assumed name to borrow books. Peter Manuel. Manuel. Is that all you gave him? Will I get into trouble for this? You are up to your neck in it. So you better tell me everything. He phoned back today with a specific name. He wanted the address of any borrower called Paul Martin. Paul Martin? Anyone who stopped borrowing books at the time Peter Manuel started. And did you find anyone? I just got it five minutes ago. This guy borrows books regularly for about eight years. Biblical stuff. Murder biographies. Then he suddenly stopped. How were you supposed to get this to him? How were you supposed to get this to him?! Well, have you got it? Yes. You're a long way from Burke's. We're alone. Why did you risk everything and come back here? And let some little upstart copy me? Copy ME? What is it that you want? The same thing as you. Then give me the address. I want something else first. What? Who killed Elsie Rind? Elsie Rind? Oh, that's ancient history, Rebus. Tell me. Tell me and I'll give you the address. You're a liar. Actions speak louder than words. I could have had this place surrounded. It's just you and me. I'm asking you, Ryan, to tell me on the holy Bible in the house of God, who killed Elsie Rind? I killed her. I framed Spaven. I'll swear it on the Bible. Now give me the address. Tcchh, tchhh. Tchhh, tchhh. Tchhh, tchhh, tchhh. DIALS MOBILE PHONE I'd like to speak to DI Ormond, please. Come out, Martin. You're surrounded. DOOR OPENS 'I'm asking you to tell me on the holy Bible in the house of God...' 'who killed Elsie Rind?' 'I killed her and I framed Spaven. 'I'll swear it on the Bible.' I'm not going to ask you how you got this, John. Let's nail him. Could you just wait there a minute, sir? Fancy a drink?
