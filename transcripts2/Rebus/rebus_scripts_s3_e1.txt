 Pick up the phone' will you' please? - Look' I know you're in there! - (PHONE BEEPS) Look' I'm running out of battery here. Will you please pick up the phone? OK' look' I'm sorry. I know things haven't been going well since I moved in. I've been snowed under with work. I promise I'll make it up to you. - Just pick up the... - (PHONE BEEPS) ...phone. Hey! I'm parking there! You're a bit slow then' aren't you? Slow? Do you want to see slow? Oi! What? See this? This is a warrant card and you're nicked' dickhead! Is that right?

 Well' so are you' arsehole! See you around. - Seen Rebus? - Not today. - Anybody? - No. OK. Well' if anyone does manage to contact the elusive DI Rebus' you can tell him I need to speak to him urgently. And feel free to add that she seemed really pissed off. (TV) And now another chance for all you Hibs fans to have a look at the famous team from 1964' featuring the great Pat Stanton. We take up the action midway through the first half. ... well chosen' to Stanton. The right half in full cry now' into Hearts' half.... Over to Eric Stevenson. Goes round Shevlane... Over it comes' another one. Just flew past the head of Martin... I've been trying to get you. The phone's dead. Shift! Football. Templer needs to see you. - What happened? - I've been chucked. Didn't you just move in last week? Why do women do it? They meet a man' they find him attractive and then try to turn him into a completely different person. What are you gonna do? Move back to your flat? - I've rented it out. - That was a bit optimistic. Charge that for me. Your road rage incident this morning has come to the attention of the men upstairs. The feeling is you have to get yourself under control. They want you to have some counselling with a police therapist. Is this a wind-up? Yes' that's what I do all day' John. Think of ways to wind you up. It passes the time. I am not going to counselling. No' you are. You don't have any choice. This is the last chance saloon for you. Now' something that might interest you... The body of a young woman has just been found at The Five Sisters. Appears she was buried alive' her head wrapped in cellophane. Thought you'd remember. By the way... The badge. Not funny. Lose it. This is mine? I worked the original case. Not that simple. I called the NCPE Opsline. They've sent a high-flyer from Centrex to look into a possible serial element. I think you may have already met. DI Rebus' DI Dalcastle. How far up from the road do you reckon we've come? About 600 yards. He's determined' if not obsessive. Organised killer' rather than disorganised' I would say. Is that right? - How long has she been here? - Pathologist thinks two months. - Who found her? - Kids' trying to dig tunnels. Did you establish a common approach path? - Yes' sir. - So there's been no contamination? No. Not sure about the cause of death yet. - She was buried alive. - How could you possibly know that? I want to see the crime logs' photographs as soon as possible. Survey 20 yards of this scene. I want to know if there are any other bodies. I think that's a mistake. We should get a helicopter in with radar. No point. This is the spot. You're sure about that? Aye. I've been here before. He's getting on my tits already. Caroline Gregg was a student. She went missing two months ago after a night out in the Grassmarket. She was buried alive' her head was wrapped in cellophane in the shale bings in West Calder' known locally as The Five Sisters. There was no sexual assault and no DNA was found on the scene. I've got the missing persons report. Her family thought she'd moved to London' but... - She was on the game. - That's right. Part-time' when she needed extra cash. I want to know everything there is to know about her. In 1986' June Hamilton went missing after a night out. She was found in the same shale bings in exactly the same circumstances. And again' no sexual assault. No DNA. Coincidence? - Any major suspects back then? - One. June Hamilton went to a party that night at the flat owned by a young man called Daniel Raeburn. - Raeburn? What' the MSP? - He is now. Back then he was just a spoilt kid who thought he owned half of Edinburgh. We have a witness that placed him on the street with June after she left the party. And that's it? Martin Cowan' her boyfriend' left the party early after an argument. But he had a sound alibi. Daniel Raeburn was the most likely suspect. But we couldn't link him to the scene of the crime. It looks like these girls were killed by the same man. Let's see if we can get on first name terms with him. I need to interview Raeburn again. He's not a suspect' John. We need to look at this with a fresh eye. I had a bad feeling about this guy 20 years ago. You can't start harassing him without justification. - Let me talk to him. - Not until you've got something new. Jess' it's me. I just want to talk. Call me. Rebus... I wanted to say I'm sorry we got off to a bad start. And also that I'm very pleased to be working with you on this. Ditto. Good stuff. It's potentially huge' this case. Could be the making of us if we don't arse it up. I like the tie. Fettes? Yeah. Didn't Tony Blair go there? Yeah. He did. My name is Daniel Raeburn. I have the good fortune to be the MSP for Edinburgh South. I came into the Parliament in the second term and before that ran a small design firm... - Raeburn? - Yeah. All the MSPs have' you know' an interview on the website. - This came in the post. - Thanks. ... resolving issues and getting answers for them... Find out when Daniel Raeburn is available for a meeting' will you? - Didn't Templer say? - As soon as you can' thanks. Why did I choose this path? On a basic level' it's about making a difference to people's lives in some small way. Perhaps that sounds naive and idealistic' but it's why I came into politics. The existence of the Scottish Parliament has given us more power to change things for the better at grassroots level and I feel privileged... (CLICKS MOUSE) (LOUD TECHNO MUSIC) (LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION) Come on' hurry up. For God's sake! Take your time (!) Mr Rebus? (SWITCHES MUSIC OFF) - I'm moving back in. - Back in? But we've got a lease. Here's the deal. I won't do you for smoking dope' if you let me have the boxroom. How's that? (SIGHS LOUDLY) Probably don't know what a shale bing is' do you? Shale was compressed to extract oil to make paraffin. This is the residue. Very good. Come here. June Hamilton was found just where you're standing. Why did you want to come back here? I don't want this just to be about names from the past' some abstract notion. These women were real. What they suffered was real. I'm aware of that. I'm just reminding myself more than anything. Why did you suspect Raeburn? Always start with the last person seen with the victim. Nine times out of ten' it's them. - You know that. - And that's it? I had a feeling in my gut that Raeburn wasn't telling the truth about what happened that night. - What time is your appointment? - What appointment? You're seeing the therapist' aren't you? Oh' suffering Christ! If you don't mind me saying' it might do you some good. You need stability. You just won't let it happen. Is that a fact? You think women are trying to manipulate you' but you're the control freak' not them. It's all about compromise... sir. Well' thanks for the advice. I don't see anyone beating a path to your door. That's my choice. I don't want to stumble from one disastrous relationship to another. I'm waiting for the right person. DI Rebus? Dr McCarthy. Belinda. How would you describe yourself' DI Rebus? Um' in what way? I was thinking of your personality. Well' I've always thought I had a touch of the Gary Cooper in me. Slow' but dependable. And? That's about it. That's the sum total of your being' is it? Pretty much. Do you like your job? - It's more a vocation. - Your colleagues? Most of them. What about your home life? You're divorced. Are you in a new relationship? That situation is' um... um' fluid. That could be a reason for you feeling stressed. A lot of middle-aged men who live alone suffer high levels of stress and die early because of it. Is that supposed to make me feel better? It's merely an observation. Men tend to fare better within a relationship than without. Well' you said that I was stressed. I didn't. As a matter of fact' I'm... I've just converted to Buddhism. I like to meditate now and again. In between murders. DI Rebus... You do realise I have to make an assessment of you for your superiors at the end of our sessions? So let's get serious. - How did it go? - Did you get hold of Daniel Raeburn? His PA says his diary's full until next month. My arse! I'm afraid my husband isn't here. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? That's good. I'll send someone down for them later. Bye-bye. Sorry' I'm organising a birthday party for my mother-in-law. Have to get every detail just right. Can I help? Does your husband know a girl called Caroline Gregg? I don't think so. Why? We're investigating her murder. It might be linked to the killing of June Hamilton. I remember you now. You haven't changed much. You always looked lived in. Aye' well' we can't all afford Botox' can we? You aren't trying to drag my husband into this? Because if you are' I should remind you I'm a lawyer. We just need to check some dates with him. You were at the party the night June Hamilton disappeared? You know I was. As I said back then' I didn't know the girl. She wasn't one of our crowd. Your husband never left the party with her? You harassed Daniel 20 years ago. I'm not going to let you do it again. I'd like you to leave. You know' Mrs Raeburn' there's never just one victim in a murder. There's a chain reaction of grief which you couldn't begin to imagine. Now' I'm just asking for some help... so I can stop that from happening again. I'd like you to leave. Now. Enjoy the party. I hope all your guests get home safely. Thank you. You were out of order back there. What's going on? Raeburn's a posh boy. He's had everything handed to him on a plate. Dean' swap these two. I don't care where they go' but not on this table. - Right away' Mr Raeburn. - Sorry' sorry. Just trying to organise a lunch celebrating young Scottish architects. Wouldn't have thought there's much to celebrate. Well' that wasn't designed by a young Scottish architect' more's the pity. Inspector Rebus' is it? My wife called and explained the situation. We need to establish your whereabouts the evening Caroline Gregg disappeared. I'll have my secretary check my diary. You'll probably find I was in the chamber. - "Probably" isn't good enough. - So I'm a suspect? We just need to eliminate you from our enquiries. Why don't I give you a DNA sample? That would cut to the chase. Very helpful' but we haven't got a match for it' as you know. Really? I understood there was always a transfer of evidence between victim and killer. Isn't it called Locard's Principle or something? That's right. Not in this case. Well' it is only a principle after all. So you didn't know Caroline then? I don't lead the same kind of life I did 20 years ago. I was a party animal back then. I've never denied it. Thankfully' Juliet came along and' erm... rescued me from myself. We need those dates confirmed as soon as possible. If I find a link between you and Caroline Gregg... you won't know what's fucking hit you. I'm this close to becoming your worst nightmare. Didn't I tell you to stay away from Raeburn? He's not above the law just because he's in that Mickey Mouse Parliament. Don't we have to have evidence before we accuse people of murder? His wife's already threatening to sue' citing harassment. He needs to know we're on to him. Might save a life. Isn't that important to you? Your coat's on a very shoogly peg. I'm all that stands between you and the Jobseeker's Allowance. Start throwing some respect my way. This might interest you. Regular customer of Caroline Gregg. Prime suspect? - Name? - Colin Morton. Never married. - Lives with his mum. Fits the profile. - What profile? While you were indulging your obsession with an innocent man' he's been doing your job for you. So he's in his late 40s' early 50s. He's narcissistic personality' hyper-grandiose. He's not a labourer. Some kind of middle management' maybe a salesman. - A Ioner definitely. - Makes sense. I can assure you I don't know any prostitutes. Yes' you do' Colin. You were a regular. Or have the Vice Squad got that wrong? Well' sometimes I visited a girl' but it was nothing like that. I mean... sordid. We talked. Of course you did. And her name was Caroline Gregg. Caroline. That's right. I haven't seen her for a long time. Not since Mother's health deteriorated. You won't be seeing her again. She's dead. Dead? I'd rather my mother didn't know. Colin' it's against the law to frequent prostitutes. I told you. It was nothing like that. I cared for the girl. I'd never hurt her. You don't seem very surprised' considering what we've just told you? To be honest' I thought that she was dead. Why? I have a gift. Sometimes I have feelings. Premonitions. I just knew she had left this world months ago. Could you tell us what you were doing on the night of the 12th of February? February? That's easy. I was here. Mother doesn't sleep through. I can't go anywhere in case she needs me. - I think we should bring him in. - He's straight out of central casting! - You reject him because he fits the profile? - Your profile. I think if we put some pressure on him' he'll confess. Our man doesn't kill people he knows. These are random pick-ups. He gets off on the moment of death. What do they teach you at Centrex exactly? Not to twist the facts to fit your theory. Forensics don't know if she was buried alive. She was alive! Where are you going? He's already made his mind up who did this. We need to talk to Templer. Will you back me up on this? DI Dalcastle and DS Clarke have registered their concern that you have already decided who killed Caroline Gregg and are not open to any other avenues of enquiry. Just a difference of opinion. You have to follow up on Colin Morton. You're wasting time. Because Dalcastle thinks that he's our man? You know... just because Dalcastle's young' intelligent' ambitious... ...you shouldn't feel threatened. Really' you shouldn't. Jess' it's me. I'm gonna keep calling you until you speak to me. Please call me. (TV ON) - What time's your train back up? - About 2.30' something like that. I take it you're a Hibby? Aye. For my sins. Me too. Did you see the game on Saturday? Shocking' wasn't it? I hear the chairman got done for robbing a newsagent's. He was lookin' for 20 Players! Well' that's the thing wi' Hibs. When we're good' we're great. When we're bad' we're still great. Aye' well said. Can I get you a drink? - No' I'm fine. - Have a drink. It won't kill you. - Eh' OK' I'll have a pint of heavy. - Two heavy. I've had a wee look around. Doesn't seem to be anything missing. - What's happened? - We've been broken into. We just came back and the door was kicked in. This is your fault! Too many people coming and going. Less shagging and more studying wouldn't do you any harm. What did they take? Nothing. No' even my iPod. Not quite. There was an old notebook kicking about in there. Oh' right. Sorry. I didnae know if that was yours. It's in my bag. - I took it to uni with me to study it. - What for? I'm interested in that kind of stuff' numerical ciphers. Wi' all these wee drawings' it reminded me of the Voynich Manuscript. Which is? An old book written in an ancient code nobody's yet deciphered. We did it in medieval studies. Do you think somebody broke in to steal this? - I'm no' sure. - I couldnae make much sense of it. It's no' that old obviously' but there are all these references to the pyramids. Five of them. Always five of them. Can I have a chat? Now? Yeah' of course. If this is about Templer... Forget that. Take a look at this. You see' it's too much of a coincidence. These have got to be the bings. The car gets broken into' the flat gets broken into. Someone wants this notebook. - And you've no idea who sent it to you? - No. What about that? - This? - Is it a story in code? Maybe. - Look at that. - We need a cryptologist to look at this. I'll see you down at the station and we'll get this checked out. (MAN COUGHS) I'm sorry. I didn't realise you had company. Dalcastle? I thought you were waiting for Mr Right. I was drunk. - Very drunk. - Dalcastle... (KNOCK AT DOOR) (LAUGHING) Dalcastle? - Think you'll make the game on Saturday? - I doubt it. I'm working. - Are you an artist? - Me? No. What do you do then? Cop. I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid. That or a football commentator. Aye' Arthur Montford. "There's a stramash in the goalmouth! "It's long' it's high' a header and it's a goal!" He always used to say "sideways". "Sideways to Stanton' sideways to Marinello." My mother used to say' "That Sideways is a great player!" So are you working on anything interesting? Erm... I'm sorry. Listen' I'll catch you later. - Friend? - Pub banter. Do you want a drink? I'm fine. I did manage to get a professor at the uni to look at some pages for us. According to her' it's not really similar to the Voynich. That was written in an invented language. She faxed me some pages through. Look. It first appeared in 1586 in the court of Rudolph II of Bohemia. Very eccentric. He collected dwarfs' apparently. Well' I don't suppose they had stamps in those days. Ours' on the other hand' seems to be written in various ciphers - harmonic' numerological and alphabet square. You make it sound like you know what you're talking about. You're right' I don't. But whoever did this does. It could take months to unravel' maybe years. We need to compile a list of people with knowledge on ancient manuscripts. Anybody who's bought books on ciphers. Check the bookshops. Maybe a name we recognise will pop up. A name like Raeburn? How's it going with Dalcastle? - Is it true he's hung like a midgie? - Don't! Where are you going now? - To see my therapist. - Again? (INTERCOM BUZZES) - Do we have an appointment? - This isn't an official visit. I just want your professional opinion. Why would somebody write all this' so that no one else could read it? Maybe somebody else CAN read it. So this could be a murderer's diary? Hmm. He may get a great deal of pleasure out of writing something down which he thinks no one else can understand. - Is this a case? - Uh-huh. Can I leave this with you? And if you have any thoughts... ...would you call me on my mobile? Are you trying to distract me' Rebus? Because if you are' it won't work. It's you I'm analysing. Daniel Raeburn's brother has come forward and given him an alibi for the night Caroline went missing' so it's a dead end. Is that right? Do you know anything about Eddie Raeburn? - No. - No. Well' I do. He used to be successful. Tacky paintings of women in fishnet tights. Made a packet' shoved it all up his nose. Wouldn't know the truth if it bit him in the arse! It's a solid alibi' so my call is we move on. Like your call on Mr Morton' the psychic? It's a process of elimination' Rebus. That's how it works. Morning' Eddie! Christ! What do you want? So... you were together all night till about three o'clock in the morning? That's right. We ended up in some late night bar near the Bridges. And you suddenly remembered and you just had to let us know? Listen' I'm just trying to be helpful here. You asked me what he was doing on the 12th of February. Good memory. I couldn't remember what I was doing last week' let alone three months ago. I had an exhibition open that night. What? You're lying. Your brother's a wee shit in a Paul Smith suit and you're covering up for him. You couldn't catch whoever did it way back then and you can't catch him now. Don't blame me because you can't do your job. This isn't a game' Eddie. If you're lying' there are consequences. Well' as Tony Blair might say' I'll let God be the judge on that. Well' if more girls die because of you' you won't have to wait until Judgment Day. I'll make sure of that. - Is that a threat? - No' this is. Now' you tell me the truth and I'll not do you for dealing coke. Oh' come on! You were just trying to sell me some just a minute ago. Remember? Come on! - You weren't with your brother that night. - I was. What else have you got stashed here? Oh' this is out of order! I am calling my lawyer. You need a search warrant for this. Nothing you do here will stand up in a court of law. You know that! Juliet? I've got a problem here. Edward' you'll be relieved to hear' is not going to be pressing charges. Sorry' have they legalised cocaine and nobody told me? He won't be pressing charges for assault. But we would like some explanation as to why my husband is being targeted by your department. Are you speaking as his wife or his lawyer? Both. Look' this is all just a simple misunderstanding. I contacted Eddie to check some dates in my appointment book' telling him that the police needed to know my whereabouts. He decided to do me a favour and give me an alibi' an alibi that' I hasten to add' I didn't need. Are you saying he gave a false statement? Well' I can only apologise for his over-zealous behaviour. My brother's always trying to ingratiate himself with me. He's not selling the way he did. Let's clear this up before your vendetta lands up all over the tabloids. We're not conducting a vendetta' Mrs Raeburn. And we certainly don't appreciate false statements. Under the circumstances' I think we can call it quits. Don't you? This way. Remember what I said' John. Coat. Peg. Shoogily. What were you thinking of' getting yourself involved in this? - I thought I was helping. - You've made things ten times worse! I just want them to leave him alone. He has nothing to worry about. He hasn't done anything! You are such a fucking liability! What I can't figure out is who sent me the notebook and why the need to bury people alive. That's got to come from somewhere. Childhood trauma? Or he could be trying to re-enact something he's seen in a movie or read in a book. One thing's certain. He's highly intelligent. But he'll be the centre of his own world and lack empathy for others. What's the likelihood he sent it to us himself? It's a big risk. He might like to gamble. There is another possibility. His subconscious wants to stop and he secretly hopes you'll catch him. But we really should be talking about you' DI Rebus. - I'm not half as interesting' am I? - I'll be the judge of that. Why don't you tell me something about your childhood? Mine? Not much to tell. But if you could tell me who sent that notebook' I'll buy you a bottle of champagne. I warn you' I only drink Krug. Me too. There you go' one pint of heavy. Put your money away. I'll get this one. So how's tricks? Solved the case yet? - Getting there. - You want a wee half to go with that? Do you know' that's not a bad idea. I'll have the same. Late night? I thought you might like to know. I found a connection between Caroline Gregg and the Raeburns. What? Before she turned to prostitution' Caroline worked as a cleaner part-time for Sophie Raeburn' Daniel's mother. What time is it? I can't remember very much about' um... What was her name again? Caroline. Blonde. About five feet six? There have been quite a few girls come and gone. I'm sorry' I can't... I can't place her. Did Daniel visit often? I know what you're thinking' Mr Rebus' but... ...Daniel wouldn't have met her. How do you know? You can't remember a girl who cleaned your house for three months. Where does this obsession with my son come from? You're positive he's committed a crime with no evidence to substantiate it. I worry for your mental health' Mr Rebus. I really do. You're not the only one. We're a very ordinary family. Very dull really. There are no skeletons in our cupboard. Beautiful painting. Who's Clare? A relative. You can't be that ordinary. Not with a talent like that in the family. I suppose that's true. You have to understand that when there's a link to the victim' it can't be ignored. Edinburgh's a small city' but not that small. If you can remember anything about Caroline' anything at all... ...call me. Thanks for your help. My pleasure. Well' if you do' fax it through to us. Yeah' to the Incident Room. It's the same number. OK. Yes. Bye. That was the university. Nothing. I've told them to fax anything they decipher straight to us. - Black pudding. - For breakfast? It's all he had. It'll set you up for the day. (LAUGHS) What is black pudding anyway? Congealed pig's blood. In the ancient recipe' you used the blood of your enemy. And that appeals to you? Do you think she was telling the truth when she said he'd never met her? She was only cleaning part-time. You just can't accept that lover boy might be wrong. It's not about who's right or wrong. Well' you're either with me or you're against me. That's my philosophy. That's a shit philosophy. Jess... It's me. Jess' would you pick up? OK. Can we have a drink? I'm sure we can work this... (DOOR OPENS) Martin Cowan. - June Hamilton's boyfriend. - I know who he is. He was interviewed early on in the case. His alibi was he was with his father. - That's right. - Did you interview him? No. Why? Siobhan was looking over the father's statement and found a few inconsistencies. - That makes me wonder. - Like you wondered about Colin Morton? We're going to interview the father now' if that's OK with you. Be my guest. I will. When first questioned' you said Martin returned home around midnight and the two of you watched a late movie together. Did I? I can't remember. Don't worry. It's all here in the files. Lying about something like that is perjury. Even after 20 years' you can go to prison for it. - I'm aware of that. - I'm glad he was with you. Because now the killer's struck again' you wouldn't want to be covering up for him. Like I said... I might have got the times wrong. That's not all that you're getting wrong. Because you said in your recorded statement you were watching football. So' Joseph' he was either with you or he wasn't. If your son did this' you can stop him killing again. Look' um... You've got to understand he was in a terrible state. He knew you lot would suspect him and he didn't have an alibi. He'd just been walking round the city most of the night. So he wasn't with you on the night of the murder? No. He went missing a few days later. Have you seen him since? A few months back' I decided to sell the hotel in Portobello where he grew up. And' eh... when I took the estate agent to see it' well' someone had been living there. Martin? He was in Edinburgh when Caroline was killed. Can you organise a statement? I'll check out the place in Portobello. Shouldn't we wait for Rebus? Yeah' if you think so. I'll let Templer know. Better take a look at this. Martin Cowan doesn't have an alibi any more. - Where's Dalcastle? - He said he'd meet me down here. I think he's gone to the hotel in Portobello. On his own? That little shit! He's not the only one! He's only doing it to prove you wrong! Hello? (CREAKING) Oh' God! Up here! Call an ambulance. He's going straight to IC. He said they can't tell with a head wound what the damage will be. You want to say something to me? - You've got to take some responsibility. - I do? You made this a competition. You pushed him into making a mistake. (WATER DRIPPING) (SOBBING) Siobhan... Torture chamber? You'd better look at this. I think they're photos of Martin Cowan. Jesus! It's the guy in the pub. About 20 years younger' but it's the same man. That's what I thought. Oh' my God! Martin looks something like this now. We need to check hotels' hostels' B&Bs.; He could also be sleeping rough. I'll check his old address' make sure he's not been there. We need to pick him up. What's going on? As of this moment' your enquiry is at an end. I've every confidence in DS Clarke. Have you had time to reflect on some of the things we discussed? Um' such as? The way you suppress and compartmentalise your emotions. Your self-destructive streak. Um... I've been a bit too busy for self-reflection. You know' it's... it's quite low on the to-do list. The Caroline Gregg case? Yeah. It turns out' uh... It's the first victim's boyfriend. - Martin Cowan? - Yes. Yes. As a child' he was punished by being chained up in a cupboard. It must have felt like being buried alive. He was trying to find out if I had deciphered the notebook. I don't know if that's because he's the killer or because he wants to know who the killer is. I really can't answer that. It is a cycle. The abused can become the abuser' but not everyone re-enacts their own abuse. I was sure that Raeburn was involved. And now you're not. Well' whoever it is' you can be sure' like Martin Cowan' it stems from his childhood. (FAX MACHINE STARTS UP) (BEEPS) "Clare - in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain." Clare? Mr Rebus' I hadn't expected to see you again so soon. Have you come to accuse my son of another murder? Not quite. I want to know who Clare is. Why on earth would you ask me about Clare? She was my daughter. She died. A long time ago. Clare was the really talented one in the family. Just don't tell Eddie I said that. I have to know... How did she die? It was a bad winter. This pond froze solid. She was trying to skate and the ice gave. Daniel found her. She'd drowned. I'm sorry. I can't begin to imagine... No. You can't. Both Eddie and Daniel were quiet for a very... very long time. When I say "quiet"' they communicated with each other' just not with adults. They wrote notes to each other. In code. Boys are like that. In their own little world. Not a day passes when she is outside my heart. You two go round the back. Check the shed and garden. Take a look in there. (CREAKING) Anyone here? Martin? Mr Rebus... This is very ill-advised. We cracked the cipher' Daniel. This is all a little abstract. Cipher' notebook? "In this harsh world' "draw thy breath in pain... "...to tell my story." Hamlet' isn't it? Was Clare your first victim? How many more did you kill? How many? - Tell me! - I didn't kill my sister! But when I found her... ...Eddie was already there. He was standing on the ice. Directly above her. I've never forgotten the look in his eyes that day on the ice. He was enjoying it. He was enjoying watching Clare die. (MUFFLED) Help me! (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) - Hello? - Where are you? Cowan's house. I've found some photographs. He's been watching Daniel. It's not Daniel we're looking for. It's Eddie. Eddie? Eddie's our man? Are you sure? Daniel's admitted it. I'm heading for his studio now. (FOOTSTEPS GOING DOWNSTAIRS) I'm not far. I'll get there as soon as I can. (DISTANT CLATTER) Anybody there? Hello' Eddie. What do you want? For God's sake' man! Who the hell are you? What do you want? Leave me alone! No' no! Keep still! I can't breathe! Is this what you did to June' is it? Is this how she felt? Is this what you did? Is this what you did? - Martin! - Stay where you are! I know you want revenge. That's not the way to do it! There are girls still missing. Their families need to know about them. - He'll suffer like June did. - Those people are suffering. They need to put their dead to rest. Martin' only he can do that! - Martin! - (FOOTSTEPS RUNNING) You're not the type of person to kill people. You're one of the good guys. Remember? Martin... Do you want to go to prison for the rest of your life? He has stolen 20 years of your life! Don't let him take the rest! Martin... Give me the blade. Give it to me. Do it' Martin. Give me that blade. Do it now. Give me that blade. Do the right thing. Do the right thing? Aye. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Keep my seat warm. Just got word on Dalcastle. Fractured skull' but he'll be OK. Good. I'm glad. And there's a message on your answering machine. (MACHINE BEEPS) Rebus' it's Jess. The problem is there's nothing in this relationship for me. It's your job. Everything else comes second. And that's not for me. But if you're willing to make some changes' then sure' a drink won't hurt. It's up to you. You can get me on my new mobile which is 079... (SWITCHES MACHINE OFF) Night then. Good night.
