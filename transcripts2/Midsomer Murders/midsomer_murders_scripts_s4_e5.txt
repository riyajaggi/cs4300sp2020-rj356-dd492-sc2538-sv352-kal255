 Midsomer Murders (1997–…): Season 4, Episode 5 - Dark Autumn - full transcript 
 When Dave Cutler, the local postman, is found with his throat slit, Barnaby and Troy are on the case. Cutler it seems had slept with most of the woman in the village so between spurned lovers and irate husbands, there are any number of suspects. They are assisted by the local police in the form of the very attractive WPC Jay Nash, to whom Troy takes a instant liking. When a second and then a third murder takes place, the police realize they have a far more complex motive that simple jealousy.

 No Dave. Don't be stupid. 'Morning, Holly. Hi, Dave. Sorry, Mr Yeatman, this road is closed. You'll have to use the back lane. 'Morning, Sir. 'Morning, Troy. His name's David Cutler. Local postman. Lived in the village. Time of death, just before dawn this morning. Cause of death, an incised wound to the throat. Just the one wound? He was almost decapitated.

 Just bills. I'll try and make it back tonight, love. But I can't promise. It depends upon the second client. See you when I see you, then. Yes. Be good. I'll ring you from the hotel. We're still looking for a murder weapon. Next of kin? His mother, apparently. Lives in a nursing home. Could you bear right please because the lane is closed. Who's that? The local community officer. WPC Jay Nash. She might be able to help. But why was he killed? A village postie? The best you'd get are a couple of giros. Then you'd have to cash 'em.

 Jay, this is Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby. 'Morning, Sir. Morning. I meant to ask, what do you do for entertainment round here? There's two pubs and the fish and chips van calls by once a week. What more could you want? You seen the postman this morning, Barbara? Not yet, no. No, neither have I. And I'm expecting a cheque. He's probably still in someone else's bloody bed. Ade? It's all right, Meg. Have you seen what's happening down in the village? No. Well, there's police everywhere. Best get down there and sort it then, Mr August? You're good at that. It's alright Meg. I had to go round the village, didn't I? The road's closed. I heard a siren earlier. The whole village is full of police. You know why? No. Our friend the postman. He's dead. What do you mean, he's dead? Someone killed him, didn't they? Simon? Here. Ah, morning, Debbie. I've got that work for you. But I must have it by this evening, do you understand? It's my last chance with the bloody tax man. What is it, Debbie? What's wrong? It's... it's Dave Cutler. What about him? He's been murdered. What are you talking about? When did this happen? First thing this morning. The whole village knows about it. For God's sake, Louise. This is terrible. It's absolutely terrible. Why wasn't I told? Because you weren't around. But I have a right to be told. Why? Maybe the police aren't that impressed with your OBE. Oh damn the OBE! I'm talking about my social standing in the community. I should have been the first to be told. Then you shouldn't go traipsing around the hills every morning like a lunatic, should you? What are we supposed to do? Yodel? Poor David. He was always known as Dave, remember? I'd say David was only ever used on special occasions. Wouldn't you? I don't like to speak ill of the dead. But Dave Cutler wasn't what you'd call an honourable man. Far from it. How d'you mean? Well he liked the women a bit too much. Other people's women, mostly. Yes. Marriage didn't mean a lot to him. Hi. I expect you'll have heard the sad news by now, Ben. About what? The murder, of course. Oh, that. Right bloody nuisance is that. How do we play our Aunt Sally without a full team? For goodness sake, Ben. Is that all you can think about at a time like this? Yes. Dave Cutler was our star player. I'd say he were a star player in more ways than one. And at least he stayed loyal to this pub. Which is more than I can say for some. Still, it's a terrible business. Oh, I don't know. Your dear little wives'll be safe now, won't they? My marriage has always been safe. I'd finished Geese Lane. And I was just going to the little house that lays back off the lane. I saw Dave. He passed me. He called out... I said, hello. And that was the last time you saw Dave Cutler alive was it? Look Holly, I know this is upsetting for you. But we have to know. Did you see anyone else in the area of Geese Lane at that time? No. I think I saw someone later. Was it a man or a woman? I couldn't tell. Oh, yes. I think I heard music. Music? Yes. Like from someone's radio. I couldn't hear it all that well. Can you remember what kind of music it was? No. It was too faint. How well did you know Dave Cutler? As well as I know most of the people in Goodman's Land. I've been here almost two years. Did he have any enemies? Take your pick. There were plenty. Are we talking about aggrieved husbands? Mostly, Sir, yes. Did any of them show that they had a grievance? There was a fight once. I'd like some names please. Right. And we'll need an incident room. Get the unit out, Sir? May I make a suggestion, Sir? Please. I know this village. And a mobile incident room is not going to work here. Why? People with things to say won't come near it. They don't even trust the mobile library. Well you'd better find us a suitable building, hadn't you? Oh, oh... David! Oh... David! Oh... I thought we'd have tea in the conservatory. Oh. Right. I'll be right there. No-one seems to have heard a radio, Sir. No. Could the girl have imagined it? She must have been in a state of shock. No, she heard the music before she found the body. Oh. Hello? Keith? Is that you? Hello? It used to be a dance hall once upon a time. I'm told people from the village and surrounding areas would descend on this place every Friday and Saturday night. I suppose it was a good place for people to meet in those days. A place for romance. Right. I want this place up and running by tomorrow morning. Tom? Yeah? What are you doing up there? Dance hall days. What? I'm taking a little meander down memory lane. We used to play these when I was a kid. 'When you lose the one you love' by David Whitfield. Why this sudden interest in dance halls? Have you decided to go romantic in your old age? Well why not? Do I have an office? In the old cloakroom, Sir. At least you'll be able to hang up your coat. Good looking fella, wasn't he? Yes, Sir. He was. Bloody hell. Mr. Yeatman? Yes. I'm Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby. This is Detective Sergeant Troy. Morning. Is your wife in? Yes. Good, could we have a word with you both? This is my breakfast break. I'm due back at the dairy. It's important, Mr. Yeatman. Debbie? Bloody hell. He was warned to stay away from my wife, but he wouldn't listen. So you attacked him? I gave him a good hiding, yes. Where did all this take place? At the Plough. He didn't bother her again after that. Did he? Did you kill him, Mister Yeatman? No. I didn't need to. I forgave Mary for what she did. And she's behaved herself since. But he must have been at it elsewhere. That's why someone killed him. Do you see your husband off to work in the mornings, Mrs Yeatman? Yes. I make him his tea. And did you see David Cutler when he delivered the morning mail? No. Did you hear him deliver the morning post? No. Did you hear anything else? Like what? Music. A radio playing? No. Anyway, I was asleep. I always go back to sleep after Mike's left. Heel... heel. So I went round there, didn't I? And the bloody curtains were drawn. Maybe Debbie was having a lie in. At half past eleven in the morning? The silly woman wouldn't even answer the door. And I need that paperwork. The tax man's all set to pay me a visit. And the bastard's already given me one warning. Was Keith at home? No, no he's away as usual. Don't tell me you're thinking what I'm thinking. I'm not thinking anything. Can I put your name down for the Aunt Sally match, Simon? No. Come on. It's against the 'Sword and Sceptre'. If they can get a team together. We need you. Oh all right. Put me down. You're a star. Debbie wouldn't have been entertaining anyone, would she? No, no she isn't the type. What is the type? How would I know. If I can get just hold of that paperwork, I'm still in with a chance. Where did you find these? Near the green. They were blowing around. I suppose they must have come from Dave Cutler's postbag. Thank you. And thank you, Mr Jessel, for bringing them in. You know, I haven't been in this place for over 30 years. Used to be called the 'Rex'. I lived over in Badger's Drift in them days. Used to come here every Saturday night. Badger's Drift? That's a good 12 miles away. How did you get here? By bus? No, no proper bus service in them days. Used to cycle. Best suit. Rain or shine. Then I'd stick me cycle clips in me top pocket and walk in like Jack the lad. Some good looking girls here in them days. Where do you want these? Behind the door. Cosy. Coffee? Please. Our murder victim, Dave, you've told us about his conquests. Not all of them. Well, the ones that matter. Any idea who he was carrying on with before he died? It's only gossip. That'll do. Debbie? You up there, Debbie? Well, it wasn't exactly a fight. It wasn't even a row. You can't row with Mike Yeatman. He doesn't say a lot. So what was it, then? It was a demolition job. Dave was in here. Mike Yeatman came in. Hit him hard. Dave went down. He tried to get up. Mike hit him again. That was it. All over. Poor old Dave. John, did you ever hear Mike Yeatman threaten to kill Dave Cutler? No, never. Have you heard anyone else threaten to kill him? No. I didn't like what happened in here, Mr Barnaby. We didn't need it. I've worked city pubs where the yobs, young and old, get boozed up and come looking for trouble. They're sad places. Angry places. And they scare me. And it goes and happens to you right here in dear old Goodman's Land, eh? Yeah, well it's not quite the same. You know, I've lived and worked in this pub for three years and not once have I had to clear up sick or fish dog-ends out of the urinal. How nice for you. Mr Shortlands. What is it? It's my wife. Debbie. She's gone missing. Over here! Looks like the same MO. An incised wound to the throat, almost severing the head. Sir. A kitchen knife. I can't understand what she was doing here, sir. We're nowhere near the road. Bit cooler out there today. I can never understand why you need a map. You've lived here for years, you know the area. Dotted lines. This is proof of my... right of way. I thought I might take another walk later. Perhaps during the evening. If that fits in with your plans. There's a motif on the handle. You can just about make it out. I know what that is. That is a souvenir of the Festival of Britain. 1951. But I don't think it's our murder weapon. Why? Because it would have taken something quite sharp and fairly heavy to deliver the kind of blows that killed both victims. My guess is it was deliberately placed there for us to find. Why was she killed? That's what we're trying to establish, sir. Was it... was there any - No, we don't believe there was a sexual motive. Why did she have to die? Debbie never bothered anyone in her life. What time did you leave home yesterday morning? About 8:15. Does it matter? Were you awake when the postman came by? Um, yes, I was. I heard him. He delivered some letters to us. Why? What's this got to do with Debbie? It wasn't him, was it? Did he kill her? Why would you think that, sir? Because of his reputation and... ..Debbie, she... She may have flirted with him a bit. But then he encouraged that, didn't he? He was that sort. Are you going to talk to him? I'm afraid we can't, sir. David Cutler was murdered yesterday morning. Not long after he'd left your house. You put the doll on the iron. Then you throw the stick. Underarm. Each player gets six throws. Right. By the way, I've found out who Dave Cutler's last conquest was. Have you now? Well, I thought I might as well take advantage of the local knowledge. Who told you? Jay. Well, who was Cutler's latest? Would you believe the woman who's just been killed, Debbie Shortlands? No. I wouldn't believe that. That was just a mild flirtation. Oh, I'll be damned. Finished them investigations of yours yet, have you? Not yet, no. My advice to you is pack up and go home. Why? Because justice has been done, that's why. That randy bastard got what he deserved. And what about the girl that was killed? Did she also get what she deserved? Don't know nothing about her. I understand Dave Cutler was a regular in this pub? Best Aunt Sally player we had. He would've made captain one day. Who is captain? I would have thought you'd have known that by now. It's Mr Owen August OBE. Used to be a publisher. A famous one. Do you ever have matches? 'Course we have matches. We're all set to play a friendly in a couple of days time. Only we don't have a full team. Oh, that's no problem. We'll make up the numbers. What kind of a place is this? Does he live here, sir? Looks like it. Are you thinking of buying that, sir? Only I will need to clear it out first. No, I'm not thinking of buying it. Ah, well, if you don't mind. I'm afraid this area of the showroom is private. Mr Simon Reason? Yes. Detective Sergeant Troy. And Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby. We were wondering if you could identify these for us, sir. Yes, they're mine. That's my paperwork. Look at the bloody state of it. Where did you find it? Not far from the village green. Why? What the bloody hell was it doing there? Did she lose it? That's why she's hiding from me. Bloody women! May I have that - No, not at the moment. Where were you yesterday evening, sir? In a state of bloody panic, that's where. What about yesterday morning around about dawn? I was asleep. Who wouldn't be? Asleep here? Yes. And before you ask, I was alone. It just so happens that I've left my abode - my wife and I have separated. So I'm living here temporarily until I can find suitable accommodation. Careful. That chair's valuable. Why did you leave your wife, Mr Reason? I think that's my business. Was it because she was having an affair with Dave Cutler? No, it was not. I left her because I wanted to... ..well, I wanted to regain my independence. So where is Debbie? Is she at home? I want a word with that young woman. I'm sorry you can't. Debbie is dead. Debbie was murdered yesterday evening. Do you think we should be doing this, with another murder in the village? It'll... take our minds off it. And I'm scared, Simon. Who's it going to happen to next? No-one. The police will sort it out. So don't you worry about it. I've always wondered - do postmen deliver their own letters? Probably from one of his lady friends. We'll soon find out. Small place like Goodman's Land, there has to be a connection between the two murders. I'm hoping there is. See what kind of music he liked. I'd say his taste in music was '80s soul. Not exactly what I expected. What did you expect, Troy? I don't know. I thought there'd be girlie pictures. Dirty books. Crate of condoms. I don't think he needed the pictures, or the books. What exactly are we looking for, sir? A diary would be nice. If he kept one. I'll take a look in the living room. Yeah. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I shall in no wise cast out. He that raised up Jesus from the dead... Upset? Well, he was a part of the village. ..therefore my heart is glad and in my glory rejoices. My flesh also shall rest in hope, thou shalt show me the path of life. In thy presence is the fullness of joy... There's still some things of yours in the outhouse. Well, I haven't had time to clear them out yet, have I? Then get off your arse and do it. ..Unto Almighty God we commend the soul of our brother departed and commit his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. And show certain hope with the Resurrection unto eternal life through Our Lord, Jesus Christ who is coming in Glorious Majesty to judge the world... ..the earth and the sea shall give up their dead and the corruptible bodies of those who sleep in Him shall be changed... ..according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto Himself. Amen. You go on ahead, I'll catch you up. Mrs Janet Reason? Yes. I'm DCI Barnaby. I wonder, could I see you this afternoon, have a little chat? If you must. I'm afraid the scones are a bit stale. So, ah... ..I've cut some bread and butter. I'm not hungry. Well, it wasn't much of a day for a funeral, I know. Especially when there wasn't a bite to eat afterwards. Surely someone could have provided - I'm bored, Owen. What? I'm bored bloody silly. With Goodman's Land? With everything. Ah. On one of my walks the other day I, um... ..I was having a few thoughts. About us. I felt... ..perhaps things might have been different if we'd had children. It might have brought us closer together. I doubt it. There again, I suppose I have been a father to those young authors I helped in the past. Where would they be now without me? Being bored, it won't, um... ..well... ..it won't alter the way we do things, will it? I shouldn't think so. Good. This place pays because I've got it right. Unlike dear old Simon. I mean, living in that run-down showroom, for God's sake. He said that he left you. Is that right? No. He'd say anything to save face. I own the house. I threw him out. Because? Because he was a liability. He also made a fuss about a certain indiscretion of mine. Oh, you mean your affair with David Cutler? It was hardly an affair. I'd seen him strutting his stuff and I'd heard about his reputation. So I decided to give it a go. I wasn't disappointed. Simon and I had led a sexless life for years. You see, failure is his strong point. That business of his is never going to work. Why? To sell the kind of stuff he's selling one needs to be in a city. Not a village. Do you think he's capable of murder? Yes. But only if he thinks the world is against him. And I'd say right now the world is. One-two-nine. Why do pubs these days have such lousy music? Hello, Jay. Good evening, John. Number three-seven-four. Yes, here. John has a girlfriend but no one's allowed to see her. Er, no, no, no. That's not true. I'll introduce you to her one day. He's ashamed to bring her to Goodman's Land. 98. That's me. John, does this pub have any decent music? Yeah, sure. Come and choose something. Right. I won a leg of lamb. OK, love, I know. John? Maybe I can get down in a couple of weeks. Sorry. Yeah, OK. That's fine, love. I understand. You do that. OK, look, I'll call you back a bit later on. Alright, see ya. Why does she never come to see you? She will one day. I don't want you to get hurt, John. You've been hurt enough in the past. Have I? The Aunt Sally match, do you think we should go ahead with it after all that's been going on in the village? Yes, I think we should. I think Dave would have wanted that. Tell me something, Mary. Do you think your husband could kill someone? No, he wouldn't murder anyone. I know him. He'd draw the line at murder. You were at the funeral. Did your husband know you were there? Did you send flowers? No. You see, there was a wreath there without a name on it. Did you send it? I wanted to. So much. I wanted to grieve for him. Show how much I... How much you loved him? I used to wait for him. Wait for him? Every morning after Mike had gone to work. So you waited for him on the morning that he died? Yes. I had to lie to you. Mike was there. What happened that morning? He... he was his usual self. Playing the fool. Did you see anyone else in the lane? No. Did you hear anyone? No. But I did hear something. I lied to you about that as well. What did you hear? Music. But very faint. It seemed odd at that time of the morning. What kind of music was it? It was... old-fashioned. Like old-fashioned dance band music. Cod and chips twice please, mate. Thanks again for these. I'll just get a vase. OK. Plates? In the cupboard by the cooker. What time does the Aunt Sally match start? 7:30. Knives and forks are in the drawer by the sink. OK. I ran some checks. Do you realise only one person in this village has form? Yeah, but it's a small place. Yes. A small place that's turned in on itself. But you'd expect something, wouldn't you? A bit of theft. Child abuse. A couple of serious motoring offences. Perhaps even a couple of murders. But poaching? Ade Jessel. Yeah. He got done for poaching 20-odd years ago. Received a fine. Big deal. Did you, um... ..did you have any long-term relationships back home? A couple. What about down here? No time for one at the moment. I did care about someone once. But it was a mistake. Rubbish! You'd be better off throwing a bloody tree. Bollocks! Glad you could make it. Thought you might miss your big moment. No. Come on! Thank you. And a gin and tonic. A large one. Small. I said a bloody large one. Large. Thank you. Come on, the Plough! Wait here a moment. Well done, John. Thank you. Hello, Mr Yeatman. Jay. You're next. Where are you? Here I am. Go on, Jay. Stuff it to 'em. So how did you find this place? We didn't. It found us. It's going to be a long night. Looks like it. Won't that affect you, with your early start? Shouldn't think so. Then again, as manager of the dairy, your time's your own, isn't it? How do you mean? Well, you can always slip away, can't you? Have a kip. Hide yourself. Here you go. I'd know that bum anywhere. Another one of these, please. Your wish is my command, my lady. Gavin. Go on, copper, show 'em what you're made of. Oi, get those size twelves off the hockey. Well? I didn't hit a thing. It's a stupid bloody game. How many is that? Four. Why don't you chalk it up on your board? Will you stop making a fool of yourself? Tom? Who's Tom? Yea. Now this I have to see. Come on. I asked for your support. Support? Considering the help I've given you over the years, yes. What help? I'm not one of those so-called writers of yours. And I doubt if you really ever helped them. You only ever help yourself, you bastard! Ohhh. Simon! Keep goin', mate, five out of six! I didn't know you could play this game, sir. You never asked. All right, all right! There's still another horse to play. Who threw that? Was that you, Ade? Did you throw that? No. 'Cause I'm not like you, am I? I don't go round killing people. Because you killed Dave Cutler, didn't you? Why else would you nick one of my billhooks? I'm going to give it up, Simon. Give what up? This relationship. But you can't. It's.... ..it's a friendship. Yes, well, I'm tired of having to share this friendship. What do you mean, share it? It doesn't matter. Yes it does. You can't just say something like that and - What? Who? Well, when? All right. I'll meet you there. Who was it? Bloody police of all people. They want to talk to me. Now. It's 1:30 in the morning, for God's sake! Hello? So, what is it? What do you want at this time of night? Bloody hell! That silly bugger August does these walks. And he come by when I was working. When was this? The morning Dave Cutler died. And that was the only occasion? No. He come by the day before. When the hook went missing. I got three of these. Only got two now. And I remember him standing by 'em to tie his boot. When I tidied up that night it was gone. I always keeps 'em sharp. Did you mention this to anyone? No. I thought it might turn up. But it never did. Did anyone else visit this site around about that time? No. Only him. Something sharp and heavy, sir. Isn't that what you said we should be looking for? Ade Jessel is a fool. Why on earth would I want to steal tools from him? We hear you're something of a hill walker? Yes. A fresh air freak. Too many years behind the desk. Is it the same walk each morning? No. Sometimes I vary it. And the distance? Six or seven miles. Sometimes eight. That's a lot of miles, sir. It must mean you have to get up quite early. I do. How early? 3:30, 4:00 in the morning? If you're implying that I killed Dave Cutler then you're wrong. I had no reason to kill him. There's been another death, sir. I'd say he died sometime during the night. Must have been the early hours, then. We saw him alive and well when the pub closed last night. Well, at least he won't suffer from a hangover problem. And it was no accident. This stuff may have been stacked like kid's building blocks, but this desk is heavy, solid oak. It wouldn't have toppled on its own. And the door was forced? Yes. I found these. Perfume? A woman couldn't have moved that thing, surely? Where did you find this? By the body. But it's odd. It's as if they were deliberately placed there. Like the knife we found near the dead girl. That was switched on when the officers arrived. These records. Last time I saw this machine they were all 78s. So where did that 45 come from? Just to make things clear, Simon Reason and I had been having - well, not exactly an affair. A bit of a fling I suppose you'd call it. I also had a brief relationship with David Cutler. I found him romantic. Simon was more or less a rebound thing. It didn't work and it didn't compare. Why are you telling me this? I was with Simon late last night. Where? On the green. Apart from the person who killed him, I was probably the last person to see him. He received a call on his mobile. He said it was the police, they wanted to talk to him. When? There and then. At his showroom. What time was this? 1:30 in the morning. It wasn't the police, was it? So what did you do? Went home. Was your husband awake? I wouldn't have thought so. There was a light on in his room. Owen and I don't sleep together. Does he know about your relationships? Both of them? Yes. Why does everyone in this village seem to be at it? I was at home and in bed when my wife returned last night. Did you hear her come home? Yes. I never had much time for Simon. Nevertheless, he didn't deserve what happened to him. I believe you knew your wife was having an affair with him? And Dave Cutler? Didn't this make you angry, Mr August? Look, whatever you think, this is my personal business you're prying into - Your wife had affairs with two men. These two men are now dead. What do you expect us to think? We'd like to talk to you again about your hill walking. Did you see anyone on the morning Dave Cutler died? I don't remember. Sure you don't come home after setting out, hide yourself away somewhere and then pretend you've been out on the walk? Why should I do that? Do you ever come home early? Never. Not even on the odd occasion? No. Only when - I only return early when my wife is entertaining. I like to listen. She knows I like to listen. Is that a crime? Nice desk. Yes. It belonged to a famous crime writer of the '40s. I bought it from Simon Reason. Oh, David! Oh, David! Dr Bullard rang about the scarf and lipstick. Oh, yes? He's run some tests. The scarf's a cheap item, could've been bought anywhere. The lipstick's old. He reckons it's the kind of thing you could come across at a jumble sale or in a junk shop. Fingerprints? No. Ah, that's a present, sir. For Jay. What about the record, the 45? Forensic are still dealing with that. It's a bit tarty. And cheap. Ghastly. As for this piece of tat, it's ancient - look at the colour. Hardly anybody wears ice-pink lipstick these days. That went out with compacts and tea dances. Where did you find them? So they don't belong to you? No they certainly do not belong to me. I'm sorry. Even in the old days no woman in her right mind would buy this sort of junk. Actually, it's the sort of thing men might buy for a woman. Except they'd be getting it wrong. Thank you, Mrs August. What are you looking for exactly? Just browsing. You are not going to build up a music collection, are you? No. That would mean putting up another shelf. Cully rang. She's just started rehearsals. It must be very important for an actor or actress to have the right atmosphere when they're getting into a part? Very important. I'm sure Cully would say it really helps her to live that part. They'd need the right props. Need to set the scene. Set the period. Of course. I wonder if the same principle applies to certain murderers? You? The patrol found him. Must have happened less than half an hour ago, Sir. And there's this. They don't make pens like that anymore. There's some tyre prints all the way along the track. Then there's a place where a car's tried to reverse on the grass. Thank you, Jay. Come on, twinkle toes. Who? I saw August up there walking. Then I saw a car further along the track. It seemed to be following him. Did you recognise the car? No. It were too far away. Could you see what colour it was? Not really, no. Couldn't tell from here. Darkish colour, I suppose. Engine's still warm. I know. Been collecting dead stuff. Well, thank you, Mr. Jessel. Thank you. You're welcome. Well can't I see you? Can't we talk? Tammie, I need to talk. What's the matter? She's found someone else. I need to go to London. Try and talk to her. Oh, no. You can't go. I'm scared. And I need you here. I need you. I don't know. It may have belonged to Owen. He did collect things. Have you seen it before? No. He was a foolish man most of the time. And there wasn't a great deal of love between us. But he was still my husband. Owen, Simon, and David - all dead. Now there's no-one. I've got another job. I'm moving to Dorset. I can't live here any more. Not after what happened to Debbie. I can understand that. You and your oppos aren't doing a lot, are you? Can we ask you about Simon Reason? Couldn't stand the man. But the work Debbie did for him helped pay the bills. Did he ever try it on with her? Because Dave Cutler did. You said so. I didn't kill those poor bastards, if that's what you mean. Who else did she work for sir? There were some tricky ones. How do you mean, tricky? Well, some were tight-fisted, didn't like paying, and another one wanted her to work on a typewriter. What's wrong with that? She said it was a manual machine. An ancient one. She told him to forget it. He even gave her a present, would you believe? A dress. Debbie said it must have come out of the ark. Pure fifties. Do you know the name of this person? No. Have you any idea what kind of work it was? Yes. I think it was a book of some sort. No, I don't want it. Honestly. But you don't even know what it is yet. Please, Gavin. No presents. I won't accept them. Why? Because that's the start of things. And that's not what I want. What are you talking about? The start of what things? A relationship. You're a friend, and a colleague. And that's how I want it to stay. You see I was hurt once, badly. I was prepared to do anything. Even give up my job. I don't want that to happen again. See you tomorrow. Yeah. Evening, John. Hello, Mr. Barnaby. Going somewhere special? Yes. Over to Midsomer Worthy. There's a jazz concert over there. I've decided to take the evening off. That's nice. Would you mind telling me something? No. What? We're checking the movements of all vehicles around the village yesterday. Just something we've got to do. Did you use your car then? What time? Yesterday afternoon. Yes. I drove Barbara to the Cash-and-Carry. That's fine. You going to record the concert are you? If I can. Naughty. So what kind of music do you listen to when you're driving along? Jazz, of course. Good. Have a nice time. Cheers. Hello? When? OK, I'll be there. Who is that? Thank you. Tom? Not for me, thanks. I see John's all dressed up for a night out. Yes. He needs cheering up. Why's that? He's upset. His girlfriend's dumped him. I'm not surprised. Living in London and hardly ever seeing him. What's her name? It's Tammie. Stupid name. Why's Tammie stupid? Well, I don't know how old she is, but it sounds so out of date. Is there something you want to hear? No, not really. I could have sworn there was a big band tape there t'other evening. Oh, tapes go missing all the time. I'm sure they'll turn up. So how does he keep in touch with this girlfriend of his then? Did he visit her regularly? No. But he rang her almost every day. I've told him he was a fool to keep on calling her. And I take it she rings him back? That's funny. What? I've just realised. He always called her. I've never known her to ring here. Do you think I could take a look at his room? Hello? Gavin? Mr. Barnaby? I don't know what you expect to find in there. I'm told he gave you a lift to the cash-and-carry yesterday afternoon? Is that right? Yes. He always drives me there. Those things mean a lot to John. They belonged to his mother. Is she still alive? No. She killed herself when he was eight years old. Did he go with you into the cash-and-carry to help with the shopping? No. He said he had some shopping of his own to do. In town. He collected me later. How much later? About an hour. Gavin? Is that you? Stop pla- John? What is it? What are you doing here? Would you like to dance? All right, John. That's enough. Hey! We've been reading this manuscript of yours. It means a lot to me. I'm sure it does. But it's not really a novel, is it - Dark Autumn? It's almost biographical. It's about your mother. It's all set in the same period. The early fifties. How old would your mother have been then? Twenty, twenty-one. She was beautiful. How would you know? You weren't born then. I've got photographs. You're right. She was. We've got them here. I wanted to write about her. How she lived in those days, how she looked. I tried to get a publisher to read it. That's why I moved here. But he refused. How old was your mother when she killed herself? She was forty. Why did she kill herself? She... She was ill. She had a disease. And she was no longer beautiful? She was a prostitute. She worked as a hostess in a dance hall. But she had to support me somehow. Why did you kill David Cutler? He preyed on women. And Debbie? What had she done wrong? Wouldn't she play the game? Wouldn't she accept the part you'd chosen for her? Even gave her a present, would you believe? A dress! Debbie said it must have come out of the ark. Pure '50s. And Simon Reason? He was an adulterer. Who needs them? What do you want at this time of night? And I wanted one of his desks. But he sold it to Owen August? The man who rejected your manuscript, was that Owen August, too? He could have helped me. But he couldn't be bothered. I wasn't important enough for him. And that's a reason to kill him? He rejected everything I believed in. Everything I loved. So why attempt to kill Jay Nash? Was that yet another rejection? I wanted her to take Tammie's place. Until I saw her with you. What was your mother's name? She... she used a professional name when she was working. She became ill and she lost her looks because of me. But you were only eight at the time. It doesn't matter. She lost her looks and she died because of me. What was her name, John? Tammie. Can I give you a lift, Sir? No, thanks. Joyce is driving out here. She'll pick me up. What's that? I suppose I may as well dump it. What is it? It was that present I bought for Jay. Only she didn't want it. I don't think she's got over her last relationship. Lord Byron, Selected Poems. Yes. She had this tatty old book in her house. So I thought I'd buy her a new one. She'd marked that page in particular. Must have been her favourite.
