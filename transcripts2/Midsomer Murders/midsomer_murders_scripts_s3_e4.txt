 Midsomer Murders (1997–…): Season 3, Episode 4 - Beyond the Grave - full transcript 
 Barnaby and Troy are called in to investigate at the museum in Aspen Tallow when the painting of a local historical figure, Jonathan Lowrie, is slashed. When the museum's curator is subsequently assaulted and Lowrie's direct descendant is murdered, the detectives must unravel another mysterious knot. Barnaby does focus on one important clue, however: a packet of smoked mackerel inadvertently dropped in the cemetery. Meanwhile, they are joined by Nico, Cully's actor boyfriend, who has landed a part in a TV series as a detective sergeant.

 By 3:30 that afternoon, August 1st, 1644 the fighting was over. The Battle of Aspern Tallow had been lost. Royalists had fallen around the king like ripe corn. But Jonathan Lowrie was not among the dead. Now, this way, please. And keep up if you will. Ah. Follow. He had fought that day bravely for king and country, Paying dearly for the privilege. But who would care?

 He was a wealthy man much in the king's favor, and had few friends in this Roundhead part of the world. He made his way down this very lane and paused here to gather strength and draw water from the well. Stand aside, please I'm coming through! Do mind the gradient Miss Bunsall. He drank and moved on. Follow, follow. When he reached this point, Cromwellian thugs on the rampage caught sight of him from yonder. For the first time in his life Jonathan Lowrie ran. Cromwellian thugs on the rampage caught sight of him from yonder. For the first time in his life Jonathan Lowrie ran. Blood poured from a wound to his left shoulder, leaving a trail.

 But on he pressed... until here before him stood the family home, Aspern Hall. Afternoon. And as he entered the great hall, he called out to his wife. "Florence! Florence!" And as he reached this spot, So a Roundhead musketeer at the door shot him... Dead. And in accordance with his wish To be buried where he fell that day... this became his last resting place. Though I know for a fact he is not at peace. You're not trying to sell us a ghost, are you, Mr. Bradford? Why? Don't you believe in such things? What, have you seen it? Many have. And before he walks abroad he gives fair warning, Tolling the church bell mournfully. We are blessed with a fine portrait of Jonathan, crafted at the height of his powers By the artist Robert Walk... You're a policeman. Do something! Who says justice is dead? George Burton fell off the twig while being interviewed about his book. I gather you and George weren't close. Last of a gang. Hijacked four lorries in Dover 1985. Nailed one of the drivers to a fence. Ooh And then wrote a book about it? That's all the rage, isn't it? What time did Cully eventually get in? Two... ish. They've got a favor to ask you. They? But, Dad, the lease on Nico's Flat has just run out. I don't care He's not moving in. What about the box room, Tom? I mean, we could put your stuff in the garage. "Stuff"? It's only for two weeks. Why is it when I say "no, you both hear "yes"? Oh Good morning, Nico. - There's something else - There always is. He's got a part in a soap opera. Is it a speaking part? I-It's a police drama. I'm a detective sergeant. We were hoping you'd let him shadow Gavin, see how it's done. I suppose a nice, juicy murder is too much to hope for, then? The best I can offer is a vandalized painting At Aspern Tallow Museum. But so far your detective sergeant is absolutely believable. Terrific. Why? You've observed rule number one... Always keep the governor waiting. Oh, Charlie. You've nearly finished. Oh, I don't hang about. Oh It's perfect. Oh! It's much better than that poky attic in my house. Oh! Oh Careful. Careful. Oh. Oh, I never really thanked you enough For doing all that you've done for me... Moving me in here with you. Well, I'm glad it's all worked out. And as from Monday morning, "Sandra MacKillop. Paintings restored, framed cleaned... You name it, she can do it." Actually, I've - I've had a phone call From Aspern Tallow Museum. Alan Bradford wants me to do a job for him. Tell me. Well, there's a portrait he wants me to repair. He wants me to go down there as soon as possible. And what are you waiting for? I was hoping that... That you'd come with me. Give me five minutes. Morning, sir. Yes. Morning, Angel. No wonder they broke in, sir. Fake alarm system single mortise lock on the door, Windows that don't close. Properly. Where's Sergeant Troy? Inside, sir. This way, sir. Yes. Thank you, Angel I can manage. Right, sir. Someone's had a go at this painting, sir. Rule number two. Always treat the Bose as if he's blind and stupid. Troy, Nico will be following you around for a week. What for, sir? I've been cast in a police drama. I'm Inspector Barnaby And you are, sir? Alan Bradford, curator. I'm surprised you've got anything left To curate, Mr. Bradford. Fake alarm system on the front wall, single mortise lock on the door, Windows that won't shut properly. Why don't you hang up a notice saying "Please burgle me"? It's a question of the readies Inspector. We're not everyone's idea of a fun day out. - Give it a go - What would that mean, then? Tell me what happened her yesterday, then. I was doing the Jonathan Lowrie death tour With half a dozen or so punters. The portrait was fine when we left. Hi, Alan. Oh, I'm sorry. Sandra, wonderful to see you. Come on in. This is... Inspector Barnaby. That's Detective Sergeant Troy behind you. Hello. Oh Um, uh, Sandra MacKillop. I'm here to repair the painting. MacKillop As in MacKillop Software? That's us I'm Charles MacKillop. I'm Sandra's brother-in-law. And guardian angel. Why do you need one Mrs. MacKillop? Uh... Well, m-my husband died last year and, um... Sandra, you said it. It's marvellous. Brilliant. Oh Sorry, Inspector. Alan, Charlie's turning a room into a studio for me, But it isn't quite finished. Is it okay if I start work here? It's marvellous. We can rope you off turn you into an exhibit. Jonathan Lowrie. Royalist, philanthropist classical scholar, and all round excellent egg. Yes 1591 to 1644. How do you know? It says so over there where he's buried. Somebody really meant business. - Can you fix it - Of course she can. What did he look like as a matter of interest? We turned him into a postcard one year. Sold like hotcakes. You all right? Yes. Yes. When do I start? There's nothing here for us Troy. File it under "forget." Did you notice the smell in there, sir? Well, it's a museum, Troy. It's full of stuff long past its sell-by date. I did, Sergeant. Fish. Your average villain's gone soft. Carving up paintings? They'll be breaking the speed limit next... Or dropping litter. You know why choose that picture? Why not one of the others? And having broken in why not nick something? Have you got something against us having a quiet day, sir? What's your opinion, Nico? - Me? - Come on, man. You'll be doing this for semi-real in a couple of weeks times. Maybe it's a grudge against the Lowrie family. Going back 350 years Never. A man dies. His wife's a picture restorer, Trying to get back into the game. Lo and behold a portrait is damaged and she's called in to fix it. Job creation? Or is that my nasty suspicious mind? No comment, sir. Have you got a comment on that? Yeah. Someone took a shortcut across the graveyard and it fell out of their shopping bag. Shortcut where? The museum's a dead end. Sir, two minutes ago there was nothing here for us. Now the world turns on a packet of smoked mackerel. Put it in the canteen freezer. Label it carefully or it'll end up on the menu. Look after this. Morning, Jim. Morning. Anything in the papers? None of it is worth reading. Come and sit down. Tell me all the new from the village. All the gossip, you mean. Oh. All right Tell me all the gossip. And if there isn't any you can make some up. Well, the shop's had her baby. And he certainly doesn't look like anyone I know, Least of all her husband. They've called him Leonardo after that actor. And then there's the painting of course. - That's got people going - What's the feeling about that? Is it deliberate or casual or a ghost from Alan's past? Well, kids is favourite. Where do you want me to start today, Jim? Up or down? Why don't we start with coffee? George Burton. All things come to him who waits. A book? What book? Basically, the job of a D.S. is to keep a check on his governor. I mean, I'm lucky. Old Tom's a good bloke to work for. But he does look for trouble where there isn't any. He's also coming this way. Troy, what do you think of Alan Bradford? I've handed it back to uniform sir. I thought it was no further action. I want to show Nico how we work... You know the free exchange of ideas. Bradford? Over the top, easily rattled born to carry the can. Otherwise, harmless. Nico? He's a bit theatrical. But yeah, I agree with Gavin - Harmless. Well, I've got news for you both. The excellent, wonderful marvellous Mr. Bradford Has got a record. Sir, you said, "Troy there is nothing here for us. File it under forget.?" That was before we found the smoked mackerel. - Morning, ladies - Good morning. What's all this? A piece of local history, Jim. A suit of armor take from the battlefield in 1644. The dead man's descendants has sent it back to us. All the way from Champagne Illinois. Well, I'll be damned. How's Sandra doing? Marvellous Quite a hit. In fact, I think we could build on this, Jim. Open a craft section. You know, real people doing real things. Come on Get your jacket. I'll buy you a pin and talk you out of it. Alan! Alan! What's wrong? I'm going outside. I'll be alright I'm sorry. I thought you said she was better. Hiya. How did it go? - It went well, yes - Good. There's only a couple of things for you to sign. Won't take a minute. Must be a nice place to work the museum. If you like ghosts, yes. Not that old chestnut, surely. I'm trying to be sensible Charlie, but look at him. Is it just me? Oh, come on, Sandie. The set of the eyes I grant you. - But there the similarity ends - The nose, the chin. The way he's standing. No You're making too much of it. In any case, even if he doe look a bit like David, so what? So now you think he does! Come on Let's go home. I'll cook you something exotic. Or would you rather talk it over with Linda Marquis first? I mentioned to this policeman that David had died. And Alan Bradford was thrilled just because I used the word. And then it all came flooding back? Yes. And then he showed us this postcard. I've known that portray all my life, But I've never mad the connection. Does it remind you of anyone? Well, yes. David. Vaguely, I suppose. But, Linda, Charlie says no. Which is it, for God's sake? It doesn't matter. The point is it triggered your memory, not of the good times that you and David had shared together, But of the months of agony when you couldn't accept his passing. You forgot the "3D" mantra that we worked out Should his name be mentioned. Can you say it for me now? David. Delight. Departed. Now mean it, Sandra. David. Delight. Departed. And again with no doubt whatsoever. David. Delight. Departed. There are no ghosts in Aspern Tallow museum. Not in paintings, in rocking chairs, or under stone slabs. They're only in your mind. A gentleman caller at this time of night? That'll give my neighbor something to talk about. I won't keep you, Annie. Don't be daft, Jim What can I get you? No. I-I just want to say this and I'll go. I'm selling the cottage, Annie. Well, what for? Oh It's a long story. For one reason or another, I've missed out on certain things, Like a wife and family. I regretted it. Well, I'm too old for kids but not for a wife. Good-looking man like you, Jim you could take your pick. I have done. Jonathan Lowrie? You don't believe in ghosts do you, Jim? It'll be the wind. Those bells must weigh a ton. Jim... you mustn't. Jim... you mustn't. So, what's it like? The chap I'm playing doesn't Have much to say for himself. His boss has masses. Look at it. On and on and on. - They got that bit right, then - Yes. Except, unlike Tom, this bloke doesn't see crime with a capital K in every... - Morning, Dad - Morning, Cully. Morning, Nico. You were saying? The difference between you and the Chief Inspector here. He's not nearly so... S-so thorough. Doesn't see crime with a capital K in every pack of smoked mackerel? Is that it? Sorry. You're sitting in my place. - Thank you - Dad, it's for you. Gavin. It was just here. I took a few steps forward paused, looked around, and wham. First to the face. Did you see the owner of that fist? Not really. Dark hair, I think. Dark features Dark clothes. But it was dark. Why were you here in the first place? I heard the church bell. It's the sign Jonathan Lowrie is up and about. And you came to meet him? Of course not. But someone was ringing the bell. Who were they What did they want? Mr. Tate You found him, yeah? That's right. And what were you doing here? Bit of a party, was it? We heard the same thing that Alan did, So we came over to investigate. I'm sorry. I don't thing I've had the pleasure. Anne Quarritch. Ah, yes You clean the museum, yeah? And before you ask if I've seen Any dodgy character hanging around... No, I haven't. Mr. Bradford. Till just now. Things are warming up Mr. Bradford. First the painting, now this. You think they're connected? 300 years of peace and quiet and then two crimes in two days? Of course, they're connected We're pulling a crowd, sir. Oh, God. I didn't realize you were so out of condition. Take some deep breaths before we get down to business. Can I help you? Yes. You can chain my tricycle to that fence. Actually, that - That was a polite way Of asking you what are you doing here. We're police officers. Really? Then you're the one who need help, not me. Do let me know if I can be of assistance. You can With names. What's yours? I am Marcus Lowrie, Jonathan's great-great-great- Great-great-great-great-great great-grandson. Close, were you? What are you doing here Mr. Lowrie? The bell tolled in the middle of the night. Jonathan is risen. And we have a question to ask him. Well, tough. The museum is closed, and you can't go in. Alan, dear, don't be peevish What would your mother say? She'd say, "Leave me alone I've been dead for 10 years." "Dead" is an un-word as well you know. Your mother is right her with us now, and she says "Don't be unkind to Eleanor. Let her into the museum." And I can hear my old mother too, saying, "Don't let this lady come the old acid until you know who she is." You're in the presence of Eleanor Bunsall, Self-appointed queen of Aspern Tallow. What was the question you wanted to ask Jonathan? Is that any of your business? Oh, please Indulge me. I need to know what he did with the family's money. I'm sorry? It went missing shortly after he died. We've scrimped and saved for 300 years. But not any more. In that case, be my guest. Thank you. Jonathan Lowrie. I am Eleanor Margaret Bunsall. What have you got to say for yourself? Do you believe in life after death, Mr. Bradford? Of course not. You told one of my colleagues P.C. Angel, that you did, That you'd see this Jonathan Lowrie. Strictly for the punters They love it. Shh! I know you're there, Jonathan so don't let's play silly games. Yes. Go on Speak to her. Quiet, Marcus. We need your help with the family silver, Jonathan. Any ideas? I know where it is. Shh. Oh, really This is too much. Noises off from you, Marcus, Chattering in the stalls and now a late entrance. Sandra, quickly, takes a seat. Sorry, Miss Bunsall. Sorry. He's here! Everybody out. Oh, what is it? Fire extinguisher. Just when we were getting somewhere. Let's hope it works. Mrs. Bunsall, out... now! Is that clear? It's under control. - You all right - Yeah. It was a bit of a shock. - Where did she go - Who? Sandra MacKillop. She's down there. Troy. Troy. Who do you want... Eleanor Buns Al or Alan Bradford? - Bradford, sir - Good man. Ask her how she started the fire. - Oh - Go on. Mr. Bradford A word, if I may. Would this be a good time to mention your criminal record? Not if I have a choice in the matter, no. You mean that Mr. Tate Chairman of the trustees, Doesn't know about your passion for valuable bronzes? I didn't think he'd be interested. I think he'll be fascinated. No, Inspector Please. But you stole a bust of Oliver Cromwell From an auctioneer in Bristol valued at? 13,000. Not for money. For love. Oh, it's the old crime of passion, is it? Who was she? Not that kind of love. Love of one's subject. History, the Civil War "Cromwell, Our Chief of Men." Mr. Barnaby wonder if you had any ideas On how the fire started Miss Bunsall. Heat, Sergeant. Yes, but did you have anything to do with it, is what he meant, I think. Do I look like a pyromaniac? I'm not saying you're the The Brink's-MAT type, But you did spend six months inside Reading Jail. Did you make any friends while you were there? Or more importantly any enemies? You mean you think I'm a target Inspector? Someone doesn't like you, do they? I mean, the painting, the nose. Perhaps that's why they move the packing case. The packing case, Inspector. It's not where I left it last night. Nico. Sir. I-I mean yes, Tom? "Sir" will do just fine. The Marcus family silver You said you know where it is. The inscription on the burial slab. It's Greek. "Jonathan Lowrie... Kai pant ta chremata enthade taphentes." "Here lies Jonathan Lowrie and all his worldly goods." Sir. You tell Marcus? He wanted to know. Would this be a typical sort of day, Gavin? Yep. Nutters Then more nutters. Inspector, I gather you've ha quite a day. We certainly have. - Let me get you a drink - Oh, please. Why did you let Miss Bansal loose in the museum, Inspector? Professional curiosity I suppose. See, I don't believe in ghosts just people with dark motives. Is that how you explain the burning packing cases? At the moment I don't explain it at all. But I can tell you it was helped along with a little paraffin. Hardly the work of a ghost. It's not a joke, Charlie. Something's going on in there. Otherwise, why is Inspector Barnaby here? Actually, I came to ask you... Why did you rush away in such a hurry this afternoon? Is that a crime? I'm sorry I'm so sorry. I-I was frightened I was... I needed to find Charlie. Anything else? Yes. Why did Mr. Bradford choose yo to repair the painting? Because I'm the only restore within 30 miles. Just seems odd that as you're trying to get Back into the swing of things someone wrecks a painting. I resent that! Resent what? - His implication - Which is? You saw what happened this afternoon, Inspector. - I'm in no mood - - Oh, come on. - They have to ask these things - Well, I don't have to listen. Will she be all right? The short-term answer is yes. As regards the long term I really have no idea. Why is she like she is? When David, my brother, died Sandra couldn't believe it. Literally. She had a kind of breakdown. So I moved her in here with me and tried to protect her if you like. From what? Oh, you know Garden-fence gossip. David was the fittest man you'd ever meet. Some people suggested he might have taken his own life. - But he didn't - No. He wasn't the sort, Inspector. You and he were business partners, yeah? Yeah. And he left quite a gap I can tell you. Sandra may have lost a husband, But I lost somebody who meant more to me than I realized. Tell me about Eleanor Bunsall. Rider of broomsticks and minder of other people's business. She harmless, do you think? So long as you don't listen to the rubbish she talks. Unfortunately, Sandra think the world of her. Hello. What's that, Jim? Oh It's a metal detector. I want to put an article in the parish magazine... "There is no silver in Jonathan Lowrie's grave, So don't waste your time digging it up." I love this place, Annie. I don't really want to leave it. Then why are you going? No choice. I'm going to France. I've got a house there in the south. It's miles off the beaten track. There's olive trees for shade vineyard for wines. The sea's just a stone's throw. What do you say? Me? Think it over. Sounds like I've just struck gold. Buried treasure? Yes. You come to claim your share, Inspector? No. My sergeant here is a very practical man, as a rule. But there's a tiny piece of him That's willing to believe in ghosts... And their ability to set fire to packing cases. And it's almost this time yesterday, almost to the minute. Troy, give me your hand. Pardon? Give me your hand. Ooh. That's how it happened. Old glass Maybe 200 years old. Uneven, with a prism in it. Which means... What's that mean, Troy? Whoever moved the packing case knew this place very well. Like a curator. Or a trustee. Or a cleaner. The police thing I cut the portrait myself To get the job of repairing it. I'm sure they don't. And I must finish the job for Alan's sake. For your own sake. Yes. Yes. Yes. Of course. Is it a problem? I-I don't know where to do it - At home or at the museum. Oh, I see. The museum has taken on another dimension. I keep thinking I see David standing over me, That he's actually there. Well, let's tackle that. If you stay away from the museum, your imagination will make that feeling worse. If you go there you can deal with it. Do you feel the need to prove That you're not actually going mad? I need to see David. That's what frightens me. Right, boys and girls Finish up what you're doing. Time we moved on now. If you'd like to follow me to the upstairs room. Sandie, I need some rivet for this chap's gauntlet. I'll be across in my office - Two minutes. David? David? Is that you? Sandra? Sandra? You all right? Yes. Yes Of course. You were quite right to call me in on this, Sandra, But why didn't you do s earlier? I should have. I know. I used to tell you everything in the past, but... It's Charles, isn't it? Typical man. Thinks he's the only one who can help. Well, even he thinks I'm going mad. He's too polite to say. "Madness" is an un-word, dear. It does not exist. There are only varying degree of sanity. Yours and mine just happen to be more varied than most. Now, what can I do for you? Well, all these strange things that have been happening... The portrait, the rocker moving the bell, the fire. People say it's Jonathan Lowrie, But I think David is trying to reach me. Well, we'll soon find out. David! What the devil is going on? Out with it, man. Bastards! You stole it. You stole my inheritance! Give it to me. Give it to me, I say. Aah! Aah! Eleanor, no. We are modern women, Sandra. We fear nothing Follow me. Inspector, who has done this terrible thing? I don't know, Mr. Bradford I've only just got here. To think. I could be lying in there. It's Marcus Lowrie, sir. Came to dig up the family fortune. Someone got there before him. Only I don't think there was a fortune, Tom. Pennies in a leather bag though. Oh, God. They've made a mes of him, haven't they? What with? Corner of something solid and square. He'd been hit six times. But not with this? No blood and it doesn't match the dents. Who reported it? Eleanor Bunsall, sir. Oof Break out the body armor, Troy. Lowrie's dog, sir Can't just leave him here. Put him in the car. Put him in the car. Come on. A security system, Mr. Tate I believe I did mention it. I could hardly get it installed overnight. Nevertheless, I'd like a proper chat with you, please, sometime. What for? Well, you thought there was money in that grave, didn't you? Your metal detector told you as much. You'll need a statement from me as well, Inspector. Why Did you kill him? N-No Of course I didn't. Brilliant at making you feel guilty, isn't he? Why pennies in the grave, sir? For the ferryman. He what? This Jonathan Lowrie Greek scholar. He'd have taken some coins To pay the ferryman to row him over the River Styx. Why didn't you know that, Troy? Do a left here. Rule number - Where are we up to now? Uh, seven, sir. Rule number seven Never use the indicator. Keeps the other driver on their toes. That right, Troy? What were you doing in the graveyard At midnight, Miss Bunsall? Is that any of your business? Oh. Indulge me Again. Insomnia I often walk at night. In a graveyard Alone? I have so many friends there. So there you are, chatting away. With a few old friends. You hear Marcus scream. You run inside and there he is, dead. Not dead, Inspector Merely murdered. Oh, I'm sorry. "Dead" is an un-word. Did you see anyone else? Such as? Well, I had in mind his "unskilled." He must have still been there in the museum. If I'd known that, I'd have stayed on, had it out with him. I'm very glad you didn't. I was armed, Inspector. Sir, this is CS gas. Yes. I picked it up in France at the World Cup, where it came in very handy I can tell you. Miss Bunsall it is illegal in this country. And I'm confiscating it. In that case, I shall refuse to cooperate further. It's too late. You've already told us all we need to know. Except, of course for who was with you last night. My lips are sealed in accordance with my version of the Hippocratic oath. Oh, the Hippocratic oath, eh? So you were there professionally. Who with? Any more questions Sensible ones. Yes. Does nothing die in your world Miss Bunsall? You know, people, plants animals? You're smarter than you look young man. We are all part of an endless saga. We fade, yes, But only to reappear in ever brighter colours. So you can talk to Jonathan Lowrie, the Dickie birds, or - Or even a Christmas tree Just as easily as you can talk to us? More so, because they appreciate what I say. Oh, right. Well, thank you, Miss Bunsall. Thanks for your time. You're not going already surely. Why? Is there something else you want to tell us? No, but he hasn't finished mending my puncture yet. God spare me from little old ladies. She's a cantankerous old bag and daft as a bloody brush. I don't know, Troy I rather like her. Some of what she said does make sense. I mean, we are all part of an eternal pageant. If you say so, sir. And on her own admission, She doesn't see murder as killing someone, does she? Ah. And she was there when Marcus copped it, you mean. Oh, hello What are those two up to? Inspector. Come and join us. If I were to ask you where your sister-in-law was At midnight, sir you'd say in bed, I take it. Well, she was. Wasn't she? We think she was in the graveyard with Eleanor Bunsall, Trying to contact her dead husband. Oh, please, no. Inspector, have you ever known anyone like Sandra? With her symptoms, I mean. What exactly are they? The usual stuff associated with a breakdown. Mood swings, uncertainty sudden panic. But that's so unlike the real Sandra. I mean, I've always thought of her as... As strong, determined, capable. People change. Especially after losing a partner. But you told us, Charlie - Sandra told us herself... That she was getting stronger. In the space of a few days all that is gone. Can you explain that? Not really, but. One or two things do bother me. Like what? The portrait gets slashed. Sandie's the obvious choice to fix it. Put that the other way around though. She'll be chosen to repair it so let's cut one up. Are you saying you think there might be some purpose in all this? Go on, Mr. Bradford. And what's more, It's a portrait that reminds he of her dead husband. You were there the day I showed her the postcards. You all right? Yes. Yes. When do I start? The portrait does bear an uncanny resemblance to David. Which puts him firmly back in her mind. But she's known that portrait all her life. Why is it suddenly so important? Because of other things. That happen around it. Bells ring in the night. The packing cases catch fire. Yesterday I left her alone in the museum for two minutes, During which time a bust of Charles I fell to the ground. Sandra says it moves of its own accord. And she went straight to Eleanor Bunsall, Troy. She did too. How do you know? Because I've been following her around For the past couple of days. I'm worried. Sandie? Thank God you're here. What on earth are you doing here? Miss Bunsall? Is he dead? Yes, but how There's no one here. Leave, both of you. Quickly and quietly Quick! You were there, Mr. MacKillop. Thank God. Supposing he'd lashed out at Sandra or even Miss Bunsall. In Miss Bunsall's case he'd have regretted it. - Where's Sandra now - In bed. I can go and wake her if you - - No, no. Don't. Thank you gentlemen. We'll leave it for now. So now Sandra's being got at, is she? But not in your book obviously, Troy. Right. Okay. Tell me this Why Marcus was killed? - For the family dosh - There wasn't any. Well, the killer didn't know that. He would've by the time Marcus walked in. He'd got down as far as the skeleton. Hadn't found so much as a gallstone. All right, then He was pissed off. All that work for nothing. So he swings around, clobber him, turns him into cat's meat. The way you tell it, Troy so graphically, One might almost be there. Annie, I don't mean to - To push you on this, but... It's all right, Jim I've thought it over. The answer is yes - I'll come with you. You won't regret it I promise you. When do we leave? Well, I-I thing we should go soon. Like in a couple of days. Why What's the panic? Barnaby wants to talk to me. Oh, Jim, you haven't don anything daft, have you? Like killing Marcus No, no. I-I just don't want the police tramping all over my past life. There's one or two things you should know about me Before we go, Annie just in case you disapprove. Why don't you tell me about the somewhere more comfortable? Who the hell are you? The point is, who are you... Jim? I reckon you were the banker for George Burton and his cronies. You shafted them. And now they're all dead you can spend the money. On your bike. 100 quid? With all the plans I've got? 100,000, more like. Aah! We're not going to see Miss Bunsall again, are we, sir? - We can if you want - No. It's just that after the puncture, I had to unblock a drain putty a window, and rehang a tile. That's police work for you... Helping old ladies across the road. I'll have egg and bacon bap, a large white coffee with two sugars, and whatever you fancy for yourself. Sir? Um, coffee Black. If you wanted something more substantial, I wouldn't rat on you. Back home, I mean. No sugar. Nice lad. But get a load of this. He's going to be paid more for playing me than I am for being me. It's a funny old life, Troy. Listen. I want you to find out how much Sandra MacKillop is worth. You can lean on our old friend Mr. Jocelyne. According to this he is the company solicitor. Hop in, Anne. Ta. Oh! Ah. Hold on. There you go. Elbows. Jim Mr. Barnaby's here. Jim, where... Blimey. They've been going at it some, whoever they are. Troy, upstairs Go on. Nico, front room. Is he going on holiday? Kind of. He was going to take me with him. What do you think has happened to him? Where to? France. France, for good. What, he's leaving all this Selling up? - Sir - Yeah. Who he is, Annie? I'll bet you money his Nam isn't really James Tate. It's a mess upstairs as well sir. They've really turned it over. But he's not there? No. What is going on, Annie? He's in that book. George Burton, last of a gang On whom our Mr. Tate was keeping a very close eye. Suitcase packed ready to got to France, you say. Whereabouts in France? South. Olive trees Vineyard. Sea. That's what he promised me. And that takes money. Lots of it. It doesn't seem real, does it? No. But he was there We all saw him. Marcus was a greedy lazy old man, Sandra. If he hadn't been he'd still be alive. Hello, you two. Hi, Alan Um, we've come for the painting. I'm going to finish it of in my studio. Ah Morning, Inspector. Morning. Sergeant Troy. That piece of china that go broken... Where did it live? Right here. Landed there in a dozen pieces. And you've no idea why it fell? None whatsoever. Mrs. MacKillop? Do you have any ideas? Uh, sorry No. Just in case you had any doubts there are no ghosts here. Just human being with all the usual foibles... Greed, envy, malice. Someone opened this window from the outside. And then they pulled on a nylon thread... Bit of fish line, maybe... Which was looped around the top of the figure. And when the figure smashed they pulled the thread clear. Simple as that? But why, Inspector? You smell anything? Fish. Do you have a cellar here? Mm. Well, show it to me. Oh. Right. Here we are. Oh. Oh! You all right, sir? - Get after him - Come on. - Who is he - I don't know. You must have known he was here! I didn't I swear it. We've lost him, sir. You're paid to catch him, Troy not to lose him! Rule number 24 Don't expect any sympathy. Who was he, sir? He, Nico, was a ghost. With a weakness for fish. No real damage, Tom. You'll have a nasty bruise though. Arnica. A spade, you say? I didn't know gardening could be so dangerous. This was ghost busting, Cathy. Thanks a lot, Tracy I'll call you next week, okay? Old friend? New friend. Right. Well, give my love to Joyce and Cully, won't you? Cathy, I wouldn't ask this unless it were important. And I know you've gone a waiting room full of people. But if I wanted to. Drive someone over the edge, Could I do it? - I'm living proof of that, sir - Seriously. Yes Of course you could. Even to suicide? That would depend on your victim. But you can induce paranoia in all sorts of ways... Psychologically, chemically surgically. Who are we talking about? Sandra MacKillop. Ah. That's why you came here not to Causton General. Well, Sandra, as I'm sure you know, is a patient of mine, So don't expect any details. Even though she might be in danger? I would like to help you, yes but... I did send her to a counselor over the death of her husband. Now, she might be less ethical. What's her name, Doctor? Linda Marquis. She's good at her job, but she may already be known to you. I've had a word with David by the way. Have you? What did he say? Oh, he didn't say anything. But I thought you'd just said you'd spoken to him. No, no. You don't understand how it all works, dear. The Davids of this world don't actually speak to me. I just put myself in their shoes and speak for them. It's a rather one-sided conversation, Something like being back in the classroom. Well... What do you say, then? I say that David wants you to be the fun-loving, Confident girl you always were. So, down to business. What's made you change? His d... His departure. Well, that's part of the problem, certainly. What about diet, though? Diet? We are what we eat, Sandra Everyone knows that. But who carries it to its logical conclusion? Did you know, for instance, That spinach can be a very depressing vegetable? Or that fennel is uplifting? No. Um, Charlie does all the cooking. And I-I don't think he'd be very... Take me through a typical day's menu. Breakfast. The cellar dweller's gear, sir. Aha! Have you got a name for him? No, nor any sign of the murder weapon. Pencil and paper, Nico. Here. One round of sandwiches pilchard, Going off with a vengeance. You think Sandra MacKillop's life is in danger, sir, Or just her sanity? That's a good question, that Troy. One pocket knife, army Swiss thereof. Have you heard back from the MacKillop's solicitor? No He's playing hard to get. One donkey jacket, blue. Then lean on him. Look, sir. We've got a real body Marcus Lowrie, and a couple of real suspects favourite being this geezer. Shouldn't we find out who he is and where he's gone? He has gone to ground, Troy Don't ask me where. But I think I know who he is. - You do - Yeah. And if someone would do a spot of housebreaking for me, I could prove it. You're too kind, Troy. Sir. Have you heard anything Mr. Barnaby, about Jim? I've had a forensic team in his cottage, Annie. They found some blood on one of the chairs. There was a fight, certainly, But we don't know the extent of it. So where is he, then? He's ditched me, hasn't he? Like every man I've ever met. I'll let you know the moment we hear anything. Now, give us a pint and a white wine. There you go. - Why this pub, Tom - Why? What's the matter? - Don't you like it - I love it. Now you answer my question. I'm meeting Troy here. If he doesn't get caught that is. Doing what? Breaking into Anne Quarritch's house. It's delegation, Joyce. Troy doing that Nico and Cully... Yes Where are they this evening? Jim Tate's cottage in search of his past. Evening, Mrs. B. Hello, Gavin. We're on, sir With a slight variation. Which is? The smoked mackerel. I did put it in the canteen freezer, and I did label it clearly. Don't worry. I nipped into the supermarket on the way here, Bought us some more. Won't be a moment. Go on. Oh, ta. What can I get you? I'll have a large straight answer. This is a till receipt. I found it pinned to a board in your kitchen. On it you'll find smoked mackerel At 2 pounds, 13 P. That is a packet of smoked mackerel, Price 2 pounds, 13 P found in the graveyard. You were taking it to the man who's been hiding in the museum cellar. You should have turned him in Annie. Why didn't you? Because he threatened to kill me. Who is he? I was once married to him. Ralph Edward Bailey. Doing 10 year for manslaughter. Absconded from Durham Jail four weeks ago. You divorced him June 1987. Went back to using your maiden name. And he's killed again by the looks of things. Marcus Lowrie. You've been harbouring a very dangerous man. How did you know it was me Inspector? Remember when we gave you a lift to Jim's cottage? Dropped your shopping. A bit heavy on the smoked fish. Who was it for? - Me - No. It's for Ralph at the museum. Well, he's not there now. So where is he? He's hiding out at Jim Tate's cottage. There we go. I'll say one thing for that scene-of-crime lot. They sure can tidy up. You should've seen it. What exactly are we looking for though, Nico? I don't know. What are you looking for? Only, uh, I might just have it. Let's start at the top and work our way down. Cully? Cully! Dad. - Where is he - Attic. It's all right. It's only a car. No Nico, sir? No Not this time. Don't want him to see our darker side. I'm not sure I want to see that myself. Last night you got from the station to Jim Tate's cottage in four minutes flat. Everything I ever said about your driving, I take back, unreservedly. Where are we going, sir? To see Linda Marquis. Can I get breakfast on the way, sir? On me. So Marcus was killed by Ralph Bailey, who also robbed Jonathan's grave. If there was money there I'm sure he did. But why play the ghost to Sandra MacKillop, then, huh? To get her out of the museum? Her presence was cramping his style. Bradford's there all the time as well. Didn't try getting him out of the way. No, but he did smack him one. Then off he went to see James Tate because Annie said he had money. It hangs together, Troy I grant you that. But it's too clear-cut. Is that wrong, sir? No, but life is not like that. So to beef things up we call on this Linda Marquis. Not for the hell of it, Troy. Sandra MacKillo is at the bottom of all this, and Linda Marquis is her confessor. As indeed I am yours. How many fried eggs a week should you not have more than then? I've no idea, sir. Four. Bacon roll is just as bad. I spy with my little eye something beginning with "C." Yeah. All right, sir I know. - Cholesterol - No. Charles. Good morning, Mr. MacKillop. You're up bright and early. Morning. Um... must look odd, Inspector. But, um, Sandra's not the only one who's needed counseling. It's been a tough time for me, too. I can imagine. Is this a professional matter or a personal one, Inspector? I'd like to know who's got it is for Sandra MacKillop. I thought you were investigating a murder. Oh, we are. What sort of a business do you think I'm running here? A very successful one by the looks of things. First client, half past 8:00 eh? Mr. MacKillop? People have busy lives I try to accommodate them. And I never betray their confidence. Oh, no, no, no. You are very good at keeping secrets. Especially your own. Do I have any? Oh, you have a humdinger. And you fit the description so perfectly. Heroin chic. It was a long time ago. A short two years ago. All right. But it's over now. For that, more power to your elbow... or just above it. But what would the likes of Charles MacKillop and Sandra say if they heard about that? They'd say it makes me more understanding, More of a human being. Oh, right. I'll ask them. No. If I tell you something, will she know that it came from me? Mr. Bradford. I'm keen on history, too. Especially yours. It seems that in the dim and distant past, You and Sandra MacKillop were an item. Then David MacKillop stepped in pots of money, and you were sidelined. We'd like to know how that made you feel. Bitter Angry? Vengeful? Not so long ago you saw me as the victim in all this, Inspector. Slashed portrait fist in the face. I've changed my mind. How did it make me feel? Relieved. Oh, come on. Passionate romance with a beautiful woman. Suddenly drops you were beside yourself. You've been trying to get back at her ever since. That is simply not true Inspector. Yes, I did once throw my cap at Sandra, But mainly for my father's sake. I'm sorry? He was forever nagging me to find a girlfriend. And I did try and fall in love with Sandie, I promise you, But my heart just wasn't in it. And why was that? If sexuality were the Civil War, I'd be a Cavalier not a Roundhead. You what? I've never been attracted to the opposite sex. I don't think we need trouble you any further, sir. Just a sec. Charles MacKillop. No girlfriends, no wife. In this, um, civil war of sexuality, where does he stand? On your side, Inspector. Which is also mine. I never doubted it for a moment Gavin. Sir, Sandra MacKillop and her will. Mr. Jocelyne drew it up for her in favor of a sister in Canada. Say what she's worth? Well, she owns half the company, Which is value at just over? 10 million. That's worth fighting about. "I am the resurrection and the life," saith the Lord. "He that believeth in me though he were dead, Yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me Shall never die." "I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter-day upon the earth." Vicar, halt. What's wrong? I'm sorry. False alarm Carry on. "And though this body b destroyed, yet shall I see God, Whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall..." No I'm right! Inspector. All is not well down there. Bring it up. Right, Troy Off you go. What am I looking for, sir? Squatters. Go on. Oh. Who is it? James Tate, Inspector Who else would it be? It is James Tate, sir. You are sitting in my chair. And you're probably wearing my socks. Aren't you, eh? Come, come, come. Who did you say is coming to take him? - It's a young P.C. called Angel - Ah. He's coming down today. Tom, I think we've found James Tate for you. George Burton and Co stole? 3 million worth of stuff. It cashed in at? 1 million. They hired an accountant Michael Whistler, To pay off safe houses car dealers, lawyers... Bent cops? Yep. And invested what was left over. But one or two of the gang who were all inside by now, Wondered whether it really ha boiled down to a million. Or was it a? 1.5 million? And if so, what happened to the other half million? They sent a heavy to see Whistler, and he'd gone. Disappeared into thin air And you think he's James Tate. With the gang all inside, he ha time to reinvent himself... Plastic surgery if necessary... Then pop up five years late in Aspern Tallow. Well done Both of you. Phone, Tom. Barnaby. Yeah I'll be there in 10 minutes. They found him and my car on a dockside in Hull. He was trying to get work on a Polish trawler. Just mad about fish, eh? Okay, Ralph. What's your beef with Sandra MacKillop? You what? If he knew any French now, he? Point at himself and say, "Moi?" Christ, where'd they dig you up? We'll come to the digging later. In the meantime, what's you grudge against Sandra MacKillop? I don't have one. Convicted killer Escapes from Durham Jail. Comes all the way back here just to admire the scenery. Oh, do us a favor. You had an old score to settle. So you tried to drive her nuts. Bells in the night breaking china, Burning packing cases. If you must know, I've always ha the highest regard for Sandra. - Ask her - No. You've been playing ghosts. In between killing Marcus Lowrie and James Tate. That's it. I'm done Solicitor. It's got to be him, sir Or is that still too clear-cut? Just a little. Motive... money. Opportunity... bags of it. On top of which, since we found him in the cellar, All this ghosty stuff stopped. Sandie, are you sure you don't mind me rushing off? The meeting's in half an hour. You go ahead, Charlie. Alan must be here by now. - Thanks - Pleasure. Oh, and call in at the office later on. There's a heap of stuff for you to sign. Ta. Sandra, what is it? What... I... Michael Aron Whistler who became James Tate. Look at his form, sir. Oh Spoken like a proper copper. Hello, Cathy. Nico, a chair for Dr. Bullard. Tom, it's about Sandra MacKillop. You know you asked if it was possible to drive someone mad? Well, at 10:00 this morning, Anne Quarritch brought Sandra to my surgery as near to the edge as I've seen her. Why What has happened to her? She claims to have seen writing on the museum wall. "David. Delight Departed." - Should that mean something - Thank you. It's a mantra which Linda Marquis taught her. Which brings me to why I'm here. Mrs. MacKillop it's Chief Inspector Barnaby. I'd like us to meet, please. I need your help. Hello Are you still there? Yes. Somewhere private and I'd like you to come alone. Do you know the lake at Martyr Warren? Two people have been killed both by Ralph Bailey. But there's a problem. He couldn't have put the writing on the museum wall. He was locked up at the time. I don't think anyone living did it, Inspector. Sandra, you are as sane as I am. I can prove it to you. "David, delight, departed"? You saw it because it was there. - But when Alan went to look. - It wasn't there. You're the one with any faith left in me, Inspector. What's happening to me? At first, I thought someone wanted you dead. But now I believe that? The last thing they'd want. Will you help me? Sandra? Come in. Come in. Close your eyes, Sandra. What do you see? Darkness? Images of this room. The windows, plants, you. So it can be with our thoughts. They can appear on the wall of our mind. I saw those words at the museum because David put them there. No, Sandra You put them there. He's telling me something and I'm refusing to listen. Linda, you're the only person that really understands me. You've got to help. There are no ghosts there. They've been conjured up by the likes of Alan Bradford For the sake of his visitors. And now by you. I will take you to the museum and I'll prove it. When can we go? This evening. I've got that stuff from Dr. Bullard, sir. The drug stuffs. George Bullard lent me that. Knocked up the slide for me too. How does it tie in with the murder? I'll tell you in the car. There's one or two loose ends to tie up. We'll have the coffee later Come on. Well, tell them that Ralph threatened to kill you. At the very least he'd have beaten you up... Yet again All the more reason to have gone to the police. That's what he'll say. Won't you. I'm sorry? Harboring a criminal. You just tell me the truth Annie, and I promise I'll do my best for you. Can't say fairer than that can I? Hello, Mr. Bradford. Hello. How did Ralph know that Jim Tate had money? - Did you tell him - No. He must have overheard Jim Talking about his place in France one day in the museum. Can I ask something? Mm. How did old Bunsall know it was Jim in that grave? The power of extended logic - Ultra common sense, if you like. We've all got it but she uses it. You mean it's no a special gift, - like she'd have us believe - Of course not. Bags you be the one to tell her, sir. In the meantime, You didn't know that Ralph was hiding in your cellar? No. That makes you either very naive or stupid. How about engrossed in other things? Such as? My work. Trying to shine a light in dark places. Like Aspern Tallow. That much we have in common Mr. Bradford. Anything else? Troy? Yes, sir. Since when have you two been so, um, friendly? I'm here to give Anni her wages. I do so every week, and she makes me a cup of tea. It's called a ritual. And so far as I know it's perfectly legal... Gavin. Oh. Why is that, I wonder. See? No words on walls. No moving china. It's funny I've never noticed it before. But you're quite right. It's just like him. And Jonathan Lowrie back in his place. How are you, Jonathan? If only you knew what you'd put us through. It's the wind. What's wrong? Look. What? There. Can't you see him? See what? It's David. Look! Sandra. You and I are the only people here. David is dead and buried and over in the graveyard. Then who is that? Where? What are you talking about? Are you sure you can't see him Linda? Sandra, you need serious help. And this was not a good idea. Can you see me, Miss Marquis? Troy, see that ghost over there? Go and run him through with that. Go on. Charlie. Charlie. What have I ever done to you? Hey. I've been 25 years in this game, and I have never laid a finger on a prisoner. But today I think I understand why some people do. All right. So the joke got a bi out of hand. Joke A joke? Well, how about this for a deal? You make me laugh and you can walk through that door, Scot-free. Better still, tell us why we're here in the first place. Directors Sandra MacKillop Charles MacKillop... in equal measure. David left his share of the business to Sandra, and you wanted it. You couldn't kill her, because then it would go to her sister. So you tried to Ge power of attorney over her By driving her mad. What for, Mr. MacKillop? So you could flog it? Run off with Miss Needle Features here? I resent that. The clinic you were in say you weren't hooked just on heroin But also on a drug called lorazepam. That's a mind bender. And you kept back a suppl of it, just in case. And you hooked Sandra MacKillop on it. Not me. Ooh. Watch out, Charlie She's jumping ship. Go on, Linda. Do yourself a bit of good. How did he do it? In the meal he's always cooking her. And then a couple of months backs, According to my medical expert you withdrew it. Now, it's a drug that's harder to kick than heroin, With 54 known side effects. Paranoia, confusion, insecurity, - Panic, disorientation - the lot. There you are Read all about it. You know, Charlie, if you? Stayed away from this woman, We might never have got to you. What? Remember that morning we found you outside her house, Pretending there was nothing between you? Except for a spot of counseling which had gone on all night. Inspec- Inspector, before we go any further, None of this was my idea. Oh, it was her fault, was it? She counseled you to drive your sister-in-law insane? Split them up Troy Put her in a cell. Stay where you are. Feel free. Why? Because you are one of those women Who's had everything throw your way, from love to money. I just wanted a little of both. Right. Let's clear up the details, shall we? The slashed painting. That was Linda. Chosen for its likeness to David? Yeah. And the bell at night the broken china? That was me. The packing cases, too. I spent a lot of time in the museum as a kid, So I knew the hot spot. The writing on the wall? So I knew the hot spot. The writing on the wall? Linda. But I hit Alan Bradford... Something I wanted to d for a long time. Can I go now? This isn't some sort of priestly confession Where I give you 10 Hail Mary and send you on your way again. You mentally torture your brother's wife. But can you go to prison for it? Playing the caring relative. Certainly made a fool of me. I doubt if I'll do time for bruising your ego. Oh, maybe you're right. But I have a big fat car up my sleeve. I'm holding a man down the corridor for two murders. Ralph Bailey Yeah. Ralph Bailey Yes. Ralph says you're the ma I'm after. He saw you bury James Tate. And the idea really appeal to me. I mean, he's going back to jail anyway. And, like you say you might get off. So why don't I fit you up with murder? Or even two. Now look, Inspector. He's the one who buried Jim Tate. I watched him do it. In the absence of any proof I prefer his version. But I can help you. Not with Marcus - I wasn't there. But a couple of nights later I was on my way to the museum, 2:00, 3:00 in the morning. At the gate I could hear digging Over at Marcus Grave. It was Bailey. Before he dumped Jim in the grave, he stole his watch and a gold chain. Find them... and that's proof enough, isn't it? Why don't you write it all down? Then what happens to me? Oh, then I don't charge you with a murder you didn't commit. I said solicitor. They've all gone to the moon Ralph. But there's a bloke upstairs b the name of Charlie MacKillop. Do you know him? Since we were kids. He says he saw you beat Marcus Lowrie to death. And you believe him? We can point the evidence your way if we need to. Well, you don't need to. I'd heard Jim Tate run a meta detector over Jonathan's grave. So that night I lifted the slab. Halfway through in walks Charlie MacKillop. He set something up. Slide projector. He was testing it when Marcus bowls up. And you'd choose the place for peace and quiet. What did Charlie do? Hid in the shadows. Bastards! You stole it. You stole my inheritance! Give it to me. I said give it to me! Aah! Aah! The projector. Go take his office apart then his house. But find it. I am a fair man, Ralph. You write all this down for me, and I'll see you don't lose parole. Any luck upstairs? Sorry No. That's everywhere - House, office, studio. What now? Now I tell Barnaby, then duck. So, where is it? Well, he... he could have chucked it anywhere. Oh, great. Sort of random Over a hedge, in a tip. Over there, I suppose. Yeah. Sure. It's a start. Oh You little beauty! Guess what. Ralph now say that you murdered Marcus Lowrie. Which, of course, I already knew but was unable to prove. What are you talking about? He saw you do it. Then he's lying! No, I think you've bot been very honest, You, with your description. Of Jim Tate's unofficial burial, and Ralph, with his story of ho you beat Marcus Lowrie to death With this. No matter how well you cleaned it up, Charlie, There'll be bits of him on it somewhere. Guess what. Charlie now say he saw you bury James Tate, and he's made a statement to that effect. - Yeah, which you wrote for him - Oh, come on, Ralph. What do you take me for a cheat? Don't worry. I've got a forensic tea taking that grave to bits. If you were there they'll find something. I wasn't He's lying. And if you weren't, they won't. However... Your belongings, Taken off you when you were recaptured. Tell me... Why has that go James Tate's fingerprints on it? You pair of bastards. Oh, Ralph That's been said before. And I sincerely hope it'll be said again. All right I give up. You stay there I'll make do over here. Dad, you're talking to a dog. Yeah, I know And he's talking back to me. Aren't you, Spot That'll be the men in white coats, then. I'll get it. I'll miss him. He's really settled in don't you think? Not Nico Spot. - Good morning, sir - Hello, Kevin. Oh, yeah. He's a beauty Mum will be well pleased. - Give her my regards, will you - Yeah. Thanks. Oh, sorry I didn't come around yesterday. - I was off sick - Oh. Are you better? Yeah, yeah Touch of food poisoning. Canteen grub, sir Know what I mean? Got any idea what it was disagreed with you? I think it was the fish pot Wednesday. Smoked mackerel. Yeah Well, that's the trouble. You never know where they've been, do you, Troy? Uh, no, sir. By the way, we're on page of the Mail. Is that good or bad? "Last night police in Causton charged two local me with the murders of Michael Stuart Whistler also known as James Tate, last surviving member of the George Burton gang, and of Marcus Jonathan Lowrie." And then it goes on about the ghost. God. What's the world coming to, Joyce? Half a paragraph on the crime and a whole page on something that doesn't exist.
