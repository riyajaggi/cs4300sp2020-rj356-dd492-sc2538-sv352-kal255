 The Body Farm (2011–2012): Season 1, Episode 1 - Episode #1.1 - full transcript 
 Dr. Eve Lockhart and her three assistants Rosie, Mike and Oggy are forensic scientists at the 'body farm'. They are called in by inspector Hale when the remains of two youths are found in a derelict tower block. It is initially assumed that they were bombers who blew themselves up but Eve believes they were murdered prior to the explosion. DNA links them to Jojo Collins,a pregnant girl who attempted suicide and is now in a coma. Jojo's father,an ex-soldier,admits to killing the boys because they raped her but Eve believes he is sheltering somebody else. Forensics and detection will work out just who.

 'When a murderer takes a life, he takes everything that we are, 'everything that we strive to be and everything we hope to become. 'I have two promises that I vow to keep. 'My promise to the murderer is this. 'I will find you, because when you stole that innocent life 'you unknowingly left your trail deep in a new chain of events. 'You left behind you that which does not belong... '..the manmade traces of your kill. 'The evidence, 'the murder secrets.' RING TONE

 Eve, it's Hale. Call me. Oggy, Rosa, breakfast. I'm in tropical. Have you got the toxicology on the Brazilian specimen? Good news is the seeds from his last meal have taken root. Great! Is Oggy with you? He's in the morgue experimenting on himself! Right. Oggy! Oggy. I'm running my skin contamination tests. How's it going? 50-50. I need a fresh donor. Well, food's up. Come and eat. £6,000 for air travel? PHONE BEEPS Our last donor is from the US. Next time, make your own breakfast. Can you pass me the ketchup? What am I supposed to do with this?

 Eve, you going out? I won't be long. I've just made breakfast for you. Be back soon. 'And this is my promise to the victim. 'I will do whatever it takes to unlock the mechanism of your murder. 'Cos that is where your killer is hiding from justice.' Hale. I'm here. Where are you? Eighth floor. The lifts don't work. Great(!) PANTING So... I heard you might be looking for a job. I might be. Depends what it is. I was hoping you'd tell me that! That good, eh? Oh, yes. FLIES BUZZING Flies. A mixture of calliphora vicina and a few sarcophagi species. Flesh flies, young and well fed. So... Where's the main course? Just keep going down the corridor. A couple of council guys were clearing the place of squatters and... Well, look! They found this. BUZZING INTENSIFIES And then this. Dense colony of flesh flies, established and hatching on a carpet of decomposing carrion that covers the entirety of the walls... floor and ceiling. Human remains? A mandibular arch. Excellent. Which is what? It's the small latch that holds your jaw in place when you open and close your mouth. You notice it when it clicks. So that makes it human? Yeah. So, take the job? Oh, I'd love it. You and the team? The team? You want the whole team? Yeah. Why not? The Body Farm's a research facility... Eve, they're closing down the labs. I'm sending off samples to Germany. And you think we'd be cheaper? No. Not at all. I happen to think you're the best at what you do. Thank you. So? OK. You'll take it? I've just got to run it by my partner. It would have been nice to have discussed it before you ran off. I didn't know what it was until I got here. Wait until you see it. OK, I'll get the pick-up and a full removal kit. Great. I'll get started. The fatty acids are like Viagra to the bacteria. Anything? The bacteria is trying to establish itself in your living tissue. Haven't seen that before. Do you know what the effects will be on your skin? Guess I'll find out. Can I see the activity? No, no. Ratios aren't right. Get your coats. We're going out. Out where? To a crime scene. Yes! Since when do we go to crime scenes? Now. We had a meeting about it. Was I there? It was you and me. OK. Maybe it was on a Monday. What's the problem? We get to field test our research. It's a no-brainer. Have you ever been at a crime scene? No. Rosa, we need a full kit, OK? There is a difference between bodies donated for scientific research and people who have been murdered. Generally, it's brutal and horrific. Lighten up, Oggy. You don't get it. Let's leave the theoretical debate. You stay here and look after the farm. So, what kind of a crime scene is it? You'll find out. Come on. You, um... You are up to speed with your medication, aren't you? Course. Great. Computer, initiate Find My iPhone for Eve's phone, would you? OK, give me a satellite view of that location. I'm guessing a bomb maker messed up. Maybe. What do you think? About what? My theory. Not a bad theory. How come you make it sound like crap? Elements fit in. Elements? We have matter spread evenly to the extreme corners of the room. So extreme forces were at work. So it's a bomb. An explosion. Caused by a bomb. It's a hypothesis. Hypothetically, it's a bomb. It could have been a gas explosion. But what do you think is the most likely reason? That is cop logic. I'm sorry? The who, how and why. The empirical triangle. I use a different triangle. Your triangle? Manner, cause and mechanism. There are five manners of death. Natural, accidental, homicidal, suicidal... Undetermined. Exactly. Well, we know we have the remains of a body. We know more than that. Really? I think we have the remains of more than one body in there. 'I'm not saying that Oggy's clinical.' He just hasn't left the farm in six months. He just doesn't like going outside. You think that's normal? For Oggy. And it's good for research. We can't do live tissue cross-contamination tests on a dead donor. You think of him as a live donor? I think Oggy thinks of himself in that way. You're both beginning to worry me. Eve, we're here. Eighth floor. Lifts aren't working. Great(!) We're going to have to haul it eight floors. Hey. Earth calling Rosa. Oh! Thanks. Shall I take those? No, I'm OK, thanks. And you are? Rosa. And you are? I'm DI Hale, the officer in charge. OK. I've got a little job for you, Rosa. What kind of job? See those children? Yeah. I'd like you to have a chat to them. But I'm not a cop. I am and they know that. As soon as I go over, they'll just run away. So? But... Why don't I take these, and you give it a go? OK. You never know. They might have seen something. Hi, there. Well, seems like they don't like forensic babes either. Don't call me babe. No. No, of course not. Thanks. I think I was a Sherpa in a former life. You make a lovely Sherpa. You do know we have an arsehole problem? I can deal with him. He's asking Rosa to canvas the street for him. Rosa can cope. Don't be so paternal. I know. I just... Don't like him. Yeah. Nail on the head. Where is it? What do you think? Nice crime scene. Should prove pretty interesting, hey? Have you got my camera? Yeah. Thanks. Can you get a separate air sample for each room? Sure. Mike? Hm? Are you getting this, Oggy? Good radiance from established fungi and larvae growth colonies. Very healthy and active. Thanks, Oggy. Only step on the plates, Rosa. I know. Putrefied remains of at least two human bodies over six sides, being the floor, ceiling and four walls of what was a bathroom. Can you come through here, please? Yeah. We have to be systematic. Square foot by square foot into separate evidence bags. You want me to mark out the room? Exactly. Oggy says it's very active. So as soon as we break through the initial crust of decay we'll get major maggot mass. Great. I'll get out of your way. Yeah. Good idea. WHIRRING BEEPING Sorry. Can you move back a bit, please? Thank you. What is that? This? Well, it's a chemical nose. It absorbs air particles and takes a forensic sample we can analyse. A chemical fingerprint of the environment but, er... the fumes from your aftershave seem to be overwhelming it. OK. How is she? There's no change. Hey, Mr Collins. Do you want a cup of tea? I'm OK. Angel? - Would you get me a cup of tea? - Yeah. How is she? She's strong. She needs you now. You can depend on me. Mike, 27C. C for Charlie? Yeah. 27C. Mouse. Section 27D. 27D. BUZZER Oggy, can you open the gate? There is someone following you. It's OK, Oggy. Just open the gate, can you? The decomposition suggests that death occurred a month ago. We can verify there are the remains of two bodies. Not a lot of fat. They must have been fit. Rosa, cause of explosion? The trace elements are there. I can start compiling. I need to know if it's a bomb. Well, it was only half a bomb. There's no shrapnel. And no ignition device. They were ripped to shreds. Compression? The compression of a moderate explosion would have had that impact on those bodies in an enclosed space. Great. We know the time of death, the number of dead and that they might have been involved in bomb making. One other factor in the distribution of matter - a strange one - they were naked. Nude bomb makers? Subversive naturists! Oggy! No, it's not a bad idea. It would be a very good way to make sure your clothes aren't contaminated. But we didn't find any clothes. There would have had to have been a third party involved to remove them. I LOVE looking for third parties. What about the blood samples? It's next on the list. Can you pull an ethnic profile from that lot? I've already done it. They were both teenage males of mixed race. Really? Any idea of the mix? Norman, Angle, Jute, Saxon(!) - What? - We beautiful English mongrels. I hate to interrupt your bonding moment, boys, but we have some history here on the tower. HALE: Police file. OGGY: No, medical. Six weeks ago, an attempted suicide. Josephine Collins. HALE: Two weeks before the explosion and in the same place. NO! SOBS RUNNING WATER Look at this. I processed DNA samples onto the police database. There's a hit with one of the bodies. HALE: Philip Britain. Aged 19. Arrested at a football match six moths ago. Reported missing four weeks ago. We need to get over there. In the morning, Hale. What? We're all very tired. Come on. Hale, don't you have a home to go to? This is what I was talking about. Names and faces! The last thing we need in here is any more reality. Keep taking your tablets, you'll be fine. I'm going to look at Mickey, see if he can tell us anything. The tablets don't work in your pocket. I know. Why don't you take them? I will. Just not yet? Sometimes they interfere with the process. Yeah, I get it. Sometimes you want to let creative Oggy out. Just make sure that the crazy Oggy doesn't take over. OK. So, this is the attempted suicide. Yeah. I've got to, er... Aren't you even curious? I'm the most curious person I know. But then, I don't know many people. I'm not talking about that stuff. Can you get it off the table please? Why? Cos I'm trying to eat. No, why do you ask? That smells good. You aren't hungry. I wasn't. I mean, aren't you curious about Josephine Collins, how she might be connected to Philip Britain? No. No? Just "no"? Yeah. There's a young girl in a hospital bed with slashed wrists. You don't want to know why? You don't care? You DON'T care. No. I do care. I'm not saying that, but she is not what it's about. You're wrong. You're so wrong. PHONE RINGS Eve, it's me. It's too early. I'm not on the meter yet. Very funny. Now, get this. Philip Britain had a mate, Ellis Garrick, reported missing the same time. Could be our second victim. Exactly. How come I can't hear your crappy old motor revving up? All right! Have you got the address? I solved it. Solved what? This. Oggy, where did you find this? In the gloop. It's the... The ignition device. Yes. It's what set the bomb off. Mobile phone. Detonator. Oggy, that's brilliant. It's quite straightforward. No. You. You're brilliant. Really? That's nice. Now we know it's a bomb that blew those boys' bodies apart, we can trace it via the MOD. Eve. Right. Yeah. Yeah. OK. What? Oh, shit! OK. What? Thank you. Thanks, Mike. What is it? There was an ignition device. Where? Oggy had it. He was reassembling it. He didn't tell you? Oggy has a disorder. And working on your farm? Hold it right there! You came... Hello. Mrs Garrick? Yes. I'm DI Hale. This is Dr Lockhart. Hello. Is this about Ellis? I've been down that bloody police station every other day. They tell me because Ellis is over 18, he's every right to leave home! Is there any news? Yes. May we sit? Yes. Thank you. We've identified the remains of your son's friend, Philip Britain. That Millwall muppet is no friend of my son's. Shut up! I'm just putting her right. No, you're not! Ellis and Philip are best mates. Please, go on. We've also found other remains than Philip's that could be your son. My God! This is recent. Is it him? I'm afraid I can't identify him from a picture. I don't understand. What the hell is going on? The boys were killed in an explosion. I'll need to take a DNA sample in order to make the identification possible. I'm sorry. Look, I'll do that for you. No, you can't. What do you mean? You're not his natural dad. I know. What's that got to do with anything? What do I do with this? Rub it around the inside of your mouth. Thank you. EARPIECE: Philip Britain was dead BEFORE the explosion. Britain was dead before the explosion. How do you know? The mouse. The mouse. Did you gather the contents from it? The contents of its stomach was intact. It had eaten human flesh. The DNA from that was a hit with Philip. Thanks, Mike. Given that at least one our victims was dead before the explosion, I guess they were murdered elsewhere in the tower then disposed of. There may be a second crime scene which we haven't discovered. OK. Go to the tower and give the tsetse a test run. Great. We can field test the research AND get paid! If there is blood splatter these tsetses will find them. I need Rosa to help me. Is she with you? No. Check the biospheres. Will do. All right. Thanks, Mike. I phoned earlier. I'm here to see Josephine Collins. In that side room there. OK. Thanks. MACHINES BEEP Hello? KNOCKS DOOR Hello? He can't hear you. Oh, sorry. He's deaf. But he can lip read. I saw you at the tower. Are you a cop? No, no. I'm a scientist. So what you doing here, then? OK. Oggy, are you with me? Let the experts at it. They look pretty angry. I starved them for a week. If there's a microscopic blood feed, they'll find it. What if they get into the city? I castrated the males. There's no chance they'll reproduce. If you could do that with mosquitos you'd win the Nobel Prize. Is your mask on? If a tsetse gets up your nose it'll hurt. Good thinking. BUZZING So, what happened? No-one knows. My dad, he found her at the tower. And now she won't wake up. The doctors tell us stuff but they use all that jargon. Do you know what this stuff means? Yeah. I do, um... Do you want me to translate it for you? Nothing so far. Wait. Just let them get the air. Oh, damn. What? They've gone into a crack in the ceiling. They're on to food. This is where it should be. They've found a better source. Follow them. OK. Going upstairs. Did Jojo take drugs? No. What is it? He deserves to know the truth. What's all this? Oh. Nice artwork. If you say so. One... Two... Three... Four. VOICES AND MUSIC ECHO Interesting colour scheme. You're in the party room, dude. Rather you than me, Oggy. MUSIC BLARES Where's Jojo? You what, mate? Where's Jojo? Who? Where's Jojo? In there! Hey, I've found them. They're going down the drain. There must be blood in the U-bend. Let them cluster and feed. Sure. So the drugs did this to her? No. So why is she like this? She cut her wrists. We know that. Let her talk. She suffered extensive blood loss. Blood loss. Parts of her brain are very damaged. Brain damage. How bad? She'll...most likely...stay... like this. Hey. Come here. I'm so sorry. They should have explained that to you. Where are you going dressed like that? Don't you go in that tower! Oi! Jojo! Why do you have to go out like that? You know what Dad's like. - You're not my mum! - Use your head, yeah? Why do you pretend to be something you're not for him? Because he's been through enough! - The deaf hero? - Yeah. You need to learn sign. How's that? What is she like? Hey, hey. Don't let her get you down, yeah? You're right. I love you. I love you, too. IN EARPIECE: Rosa? Rosa, where are you? EARPIECE BEEPS What's wrong? Something's missing. I won't be a minute. Hi, there. I'm Rosa Gilbert, a forensic investigator for the Home Office. We're looking at the Josephine Collins case. I need to see the rest of this file. I'll need a doctor's permission. What if you have her dad's permission? Yeah. Give it to her. OK. I think you'll find everything in order. I'm sure I will. Her recent bloods are showing HCG. Yes. Why is it not on the top page? They only started to show two weeks after she came in. What is it? Your daughter, Josephine... She's pregnant. PARTY MUSIC ECHOES JOJO SOBBING Bastard! Who? Nathan! I hate him! I hate him too, Jojo. You need to chill! Open wide! Let the party begin! Give us a smile! Hello! OK, the tsetse harvested a good DNA sample from the blood in the U-bend, but it's not a match to either of the victims at the explosion. Hm. Can you get a profile? IN EARPIECE: Yeah, DNA belongs to a mixed race Afro-Caribbean female. Have you got secondary on the contents of the U-bend? Yeah. Pubic hair. There are secondary traces on the female hair. Two. Philip Britain and... Ellis Garrick? Yeah. Oh. Bastards. What? The male DNAs are semen. They must have had intercourse with her then washed her. So where's their victim? Oggy, run the DNA against the attempted suicide. I'll do it. No need to, Mike. It's her DNA. Rosa, where are you? How do you know? I'm looking at her. Josephine Collins. Aged 17. Had GHB in her blood. The rape kit came back negative. Now we know why. They purged her in the bath. Then cut her wrists. And left her to bleed to death. You should have told me. Asked your permission? Yeah. Why? Why? Look... We'll deal with this later. What I need to know is how is she? She's brain dead. The hospital have a "do not resuscitate" on her. But her dad doesn't know that. And he's deaf. ON PHONE: Hello, Eve? Mike? ..Yeah. This is Jojo. And her dad. Hello. Hello. - I'm a police officer, DI Hale. - Hi. Sorry, I just need to, um... So sorry. Back in a moment. Mike got the report back on the ignition device on the bomb. The MOD say it's seriously professional. The type used by insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. The dad's ex-army. Yeah? There's a Royal Engineers tattoo on his arm. Sorry. We'll take it outside. So... We have an expert in IDs who has a kid in a coma. We have two dead kids who live in her social circle. And she was raped. Well, possibly. Made pregnant by one of the males who raped her. Then posed her. That's not established. You saw her! Bastards! Rosa. Hale's right. We have no evidence for that. We don't have evidence that they cut her wrists. It could have been self-inflicted. So what? She was still raped. That could be, but... But what? As harsh as this sounds, our only interest in this girl is to know if she was motivation for the crime that we are investigating, the double murder of two teenage boys. EXPLOSION I need you to run this inside your mouth. Why? Because we think your DNA might be on a crime scene. - We should have a solicitor. - Why? So you don't fit him up! For what? For something. Please. Thank you. I'll get this analysed. Now, you found Jojo. - Yeah. - How did you know where she was? I tried to... The tower is where we hang out! > Dad was always there after us, getting us home. It's not a good place. No. It isn't. So, he finds me but we can't find Jojo. So my dad searches the building. And you find her alone and bleeding? And naked. > Mike, I'm sending Peter Collins' DNA through now. The dad's a hit on the second crime scene. We knew he found Jojo. No connection with the first crime scene? There is. But it's not physical. What is it? I'm sending it through now. HALE: I've been looking at your discharge papers. You were made deaf on duty in Iraq. An IED that you were disarming went off. No. No, I disarmed the bomb, but... > there was a second bomb. In another room that your mates thought was safe? It's that one. Sorry for your loss. Philip Britain and Ellis Garrick were disposed of in an explosion exactly the same as that one where you lost your mates. I see. We believe that they both raped Jojo. Do you understand that, right now, because of your background and your knowledge, you're the only person who could have done this? Yes. Unless someone else had access to your bomb-making knowledge. PETER: No. - No. It was me. - Dad! PETER: I said, it was me. I've said that I did it. I need to get this. Back in a minute. - Why are you doing this? - I need to. What are you doing? He's obviously lying. Answer it on speaker. PETER: 'I wasn't there for you and Jojo when you needed me.' I want to be here for you now. So you listen to me. I just need to know. Did you do it? No. PETER: 'Nathan?' They deserved it, Dad. I know. Nathan. We'll pull him. You make sure that Nathan knows. OK? For what? We haven't got any evidence against him. Get him off the streets. He'll shut up shop and we'll get nowhere. No. He doesn't know we're on to him. He's not going to leave the country, so let's search his flat. Peter, right now, you are under arrest. Do you understand that? Yeah. I don't want to take you to the police cells. I'm not going anywhere. You've got my word. HALE: There'll be an officer outside. Just in case. Ta-da! From Nathan's flat. You had a warrant? Of course. You didn't touch them? They were hidden and they were closed. A perfectly preserved time capsule. Let's take a look. And can you hurry up? OK, clothes, all male. I've got three T-shirts. There are only two victims. Three pairs of trousers. Third party clothing. Could be. VOICES ON MOBILE Oggy. Oggy. It's OK. It's OK, mate. They recorded it. Why did they record it? It's OK, mate. Take five minutes. Get some fresh air. Well done. MALE VOICE 'Come on, Jojo. You can do better than that.' Now we have the motivation for Nathan killing Garrick and Britain. Motivation's not enough. We need to tie him down forensically. Right. I'm on it. Nathan, you need to come and get me. I messed up. SCREAMS: Why won't you come? SOBS What? We're going home. Look at the state of you! Miss Perfect(!) < Come on. I'm not ready to go yet. You know that Dad's going to come looking for us. So? Let him. You shouldn't do that to him. BEEPING BEEPING STOPS ALARM BLARES Excuse me. Yeah. She's flat-lining. No resus. WHISPERS: It's OK. Don't be afraid. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I have to ask this now, but we have a problem. We can put Nathan at the crime scene. We need the truth. Angel? We need to find Nathan. No. Angel... I said no. You think you understand, don't you? But you don't. I do. You feel guilty for what happened to your sister. Nathan did what he did for you. No. Why can't you just leave things as they are? Leave it be. I can't. Where is he? Tell her. I said no. OK. Yup. Go ahead, Mike. I finished working on the third T-shirt. It's Nathan's. But something's not adding up. It's stained with blood from Garrick and Britain. A third sample had been washed out, but not completely. It's Jojo's blood. Thanks. Who found Jojo? Dad and me. Tell me how you found her. Why? - Tell her. - She went missing. She always does this. Let's split up. But babe... Just do it, before my dad gets here. 'I walked all over, then I saw Dad heading to the party room.' Dad! Where's Jojo? Where's Jojo? ANGEL: 'Then it all kicked off.' NO! We got an ambulance as quick as we could. Did Nathan help to carry Jojo? Nathan? No. He was looking somewhere else. He wasn't there when you found her? No. So how come her blood is on his T-shirt? You've made that up to confuse me, so that I'll tell you where he is. No, no. No. I'm telling you the truth. It's obvious to me that Nathan's lying to you. No. He's not. I'm sorry, Angel. Why? Because...I'm going to have to prove to you that he is. It's going to hurt you and I don't want to do that but... It has to be done. Hi, Mike. Are you there? 'Yeah. I'm here.' Mike, could you prepare the morgue for an autopsy? We're bringing Josephine Collins back to the farm. Thanks. Can you track him by his phone? Yes. If we had his number. That's his number. Dad! Enough! I want to know the truth, and so should you. When you get a location on Nathan's phone, don't bring him in. You're joking? No. There are half a dozen reasons for the evidence being in his flat. Well, I can make him tell the truth. I'm sure you can. Until he changes his plea and we're at square one. Wait for the evidence, please. Eve, just remember, I AM in charge of this investigation. Course you are. What you doing? Looking at the moon. The moon? It's just so... ..beautiful. Why don't you see the moon, Nathan? You're off your head. Do you care? Me and Angel have been looking for you. It's all about Angel, isn't it? You know why you can't see the moon, Nathan? Cos I don't do drugs. No. Not because you don't drink or don't smoke. It's because you have no soul. Come inside, please. You like me like this, yeah? Stop it! Look at the moon with me. I know you see it, too. HALE ON PHONE: Eve, can you hear me? I can hear you. Go ahead. We've traced Nathan to the tower. Now what? Can you run a paternity test? Sure. As soon as possible, Rosa. So you'll let me talk to him. Yeah. Alone! Yes. I don't want to be part of that bullying thing any more. Just make sure you leave that on. OK. I'm doing this for you. Fine. Can you turn it on, please? It is on. It's OK, Nathan. I'm not a police officer. What do you want? I'm trying to fill in some gaps. On the night that Jojo cut her wrists she called you ten times. My phone was off... Rosa? Hale. Patch into Eve's camera. You didn't find her, did you? ..Make sure Angel sees it. She left you a message I know you listened to. Nathan! You need to come and get me. I messed up. But I'm going to do it. Do you hear me? SCREAMS Why won't you come? We found the clothes you hid. Ellis and Philip's and your shirt stained with Jojo's blood. How is that possible? How did her blood come to be on your shirt? I was helping. Angel told us you weren't there. I found her! Before Peter found her? Yeah. When you got the message? I thought she was dead. No, no. You knew she wasn't dead. We analysed the blood pattern you tried to wash out. She grabbed you like this! Nathan! No! It didn't make sense to me... Eve, take it easy. Why would she go off with those two? Why would you find her then leave her to die here? You're mental. Is that what you told her? She was mental? Well, guess what, Nathan. I know why. She was pregnant. No. I did a paternity test on the foetus in her womb. You were the father of her child. No! JOJO: What are you going to do about it? You'll be sorry. You were terrified Angel would find out. You didn't know her. She was a jealous little sister who wanted everything Angel had - you. Look, Nathan, I'm not here because of Jojo. What went on with you and Jojo wasn't a crime. So? Ellis and Philip. That was premeditated. I've got nothing to say. You let Angel believe that you murdered those two in revenge for what they did to Jojo. But you lied to her. You killed them to stop them from telling her about you and Jojo. Then you disposed of their bodies in an explosion. Nothing. To. Say. Nathan, listen to me. Look at me. Walk out of here now and you will be abandoning Angel, the same way you did her sister. She deserves better than that. Please. I keep telling you, I've got nothing to say. Give me one reason. Go on. Give me one reason. ANGEL: He followed me. Philip and Ellis said they wanted to meet me and explain. 'They were dead afraid. 'Everyone was blaming them for what happened with Jojo.' They went on about how it was a mad night that just got out of control. Everyone says she did that over us! She started the whole thing. Just to make Nathan jealous. So, which one of us are you into? Both of you! No way, man! Yeah! Come on! So, you know... we got it on in the bath. The three of you? It's what she wanted. We was all off our heads. - Why did she cut her wrists? - She was fine when we left. She said she'd follow us back in. She was gonna phone Nathan. Nathan? SHOUTS AND SCREAMS It was over in a flash. He said that they were both dead, that he'd get rid of the bodies. That he'd deal with it. It's OK, Angel. Just tell the truth. Nathan would stay up all night with my dad. Talking. He loved it. About the army and the war and all of that. My dad would tell him what he did. About the bombs. And he listened and learned. Yeah. All this time, I thought that Philip and Ellis were lying.
