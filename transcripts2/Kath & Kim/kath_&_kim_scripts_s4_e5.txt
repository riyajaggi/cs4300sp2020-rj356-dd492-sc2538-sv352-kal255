 What's going on? Brett! (WHISPERS) Sorry, sorry, just trying to find the toilet. Sorry! (TOILET FLUSHES, CISTERN RUNS) KATH: Bang the toilet, please, Brett. BRETT: Yeah, sorry. (THUMPS TOILET) (SILENCE) (WHISPERS) Thanks, sorry. Thank you. KATH: I know. What's going on? Kim, it's 4:30! Turn the light off. I've got to go to the toilet! Shut the door!

 (TOILET FLUSHES) KATH: Did you wash your hands? Kim? Come back and bang the toilet, please. (CISTERN RUNS) (TUTS) (THUMPS TOILET REPEATEDLY) (SIGHS) Come on. Whose bright idea was it to turn the bathroom into a bedroom for Epponnee? We've lost a toot now. Oh, she was keeping us awake all night. Yeah, well, look who's waking us up all night now. Come on, Brett, hurry up. (TOILET FLUSHES, CISTERN RUNS) Sorry, Kath. It's OK, Brett. (GAGS) (MUTTERS) Brett, can you put the fan on, please? You know, Kim, Epponnee's growing up. There's just no room for you all here anymore. I mean, you're almost 27. You should be putting down a deposit. I'd paid off my flat, and single, by that age. Oh, that is so old-school. I mean, people stay home till they're 30-plus these days. Why did you have me if you can't look after me? (SIGHS) Well, if you're not going to move out, Kim, maybe I will. That'd be good, actually. Oh, shut up, Kim. (BANGS TOILET) (EPPONNEE COOS) You don't own this house, you know, Kel. KATH: No, Kim, I do. And while Kel is here at my behest, I expect you to treat him as such, please. - I better go. - KATH: Oh, OK. Bye, doll. (TREADS ON SQUEAKY TOY) Watch where you're going. Oh! Kel's left his Anti Cancer Council sunnies. Kel! You want some of this cheese, Epps? Oh, look! Ooh, it's nice. KATH: Kel. Kelly, doll, sorry. - You forgot these.  - Thanks. You alright, Kel? Kath, I'm not just here at your behest. - I am your husband. - Oh, well, I know that! I didn't mean that. You know, it's just a silly slip of my tongue. Yeah, but it was a Freudian slip of your tongue, wasn't it? Oh, what's that supposed to mean? Well, you're right. This is your house. Wouldn't it be nice if we had our stakes in something together? Well, yeah, it would be. And you know, if we had the dough, I'd love to buy Mandy's house. Sell here and kill two birds. What, Mandy and Kim? Ha! Yeah. Well, I guess we've already killed Mandy. She's flying off to Poowong to grow agapants on a commercial scale. It's a beautiful house. I'd love to have a gander inside. Yeah. Well, we never got the invite, did we? (LAUGHS) Oh, it's open tomorrow. Oh, let's go and have a squiz, just for fun. - Alright, OK. - Alright, doll, bye. Mmm. Have a nice day. Kim, you are going to have to cull some of Epponnee's toys. They're taking over. (PLUSH TOY GURGLES) Shh! Stop singing, Furby, please. OK. It's like a brothel in here! Is it, Mum? I wouldn't know. Never been in one, unlike you. Stop it, Kim. Shut up, Furby! Hello, Sharon. Hi, Mrs D. Hi, Kimmy. What are all the bags for? Well, I've been kicked out of my flat. KIM: Why? Well, my dad came back from Tewantin today and he wants his flat back. Yeah, and Debbie, my step-mum, has decided to stucco it and double the rent. Oh, well, Sharon, love, you can't stay here. We're chockers at the moment. Can you go to a motel or something? SHARON: I haven't got any money. I've been retrenched. They're closing down the hospital. Oh, no, not the Repat? Yeah, yeah, they're going to turn it into flats. They've decided to stucco it and double the rent. (TUTS) Such a whinger. It's not that bad. (RAISES VOICE) Not that bad? Not that bad, Kim? I have got no flat, no job and no love-life. (SOBS) KATH: Oh, alright, Sharon, love. You can stay here and sleep on the fold-out until you work something out. Oh, thanks, Mrs D. You know, now, on top of everything, all this stress has given me irritable bowel syndrome. (FART!) Shut up, Furby! Oh, actually, that wasn't Furby, Mrs D. HOST: 999, going once, twice… - Deal or no deal?  - SHARON: Deal! Deal! She's wearing my top. Do I look as fat as her? Yes! What? Deal! Deal! Take the bank offer! Deal! CONTESTANT: Um, deal. ALL: Yes! Oh, you're good at this, Sharon. KIM: She just won 13 grand, that fat one. - You should go on it.  - Really? Oh. Maybe I should. I mean, imagine if I won the 200,000 grand. That would solve all my problems. Not all your problems. And frankly, Sharon, I don't think they'd let you on TV. They're going for a pacific type. You know, young and pretty. Oh. Yeah, I suppose you're right, Kim. Well, maybe I should take someone with me. Who do I know who's young and pretty? Hello! (SCOFFS) Yeah, I suppose you could come with me, Kim. Alright, stop your begging. I'll come. (DOOR OPENS) - KATH: Who's that? - SHARON: Oh, it's just me, Mrs D. Won't be a Mo. There's a toot downstairs, Sharon. Oh, no, that one's blocked, Mrs D. Blocked. This house is just too damn small. KEL: It's nice. (GASPS) Oh! Wow! Look at that, Kel. Mandy's pulled out all the period alcatrazes. (TUTS) Oh, that's a crime. Great house, though. Great bones. What era is it, Kath? Oh, it's definitely turn-of-the-century. Which century, I can't say, but probably both. KEL: Gee, I'd like to have a good go at Mandy's drawers. What, Kel? Mandy's walk-in. Look at this. She's got her smalls in with her tees. Ooh! (CHUCKLES) Yeah, look at the fretful work, Kel. I can just see my maidenhairs hanging all along the veranda there. Oh, I love it. (TUTS) I know, but the stamp duty alone would cripple us. (SLOP!) Hey! Oh! (TUTS) Kim, stop that! Come on, Sharon! Oh! You look nice. Is that a new skirt? It's not a skirt. It's shallots. Oh. Right. It looks lovely. Just excuse me. Ow! Sharon! Excuse me. We're here for the 'Deal' audition. Excuse me. Excuse me! God! SHARON: Oh, wow! Kimmy, look at the stable of stars! With my amazing looks and talent, won't be long before somebody puts me in a stable. Yeah. KATH: Kel! Kel! Did you see someone just bought Mandy's house? I know. I actually know the guy. Really? Who? You should see his wife. She's a real fox. I quite fancy her. Kel. Oh, what's the Yellow for, Brett? Go on, tell her, Kel. Have a flute, foxy. We're moving up in the world. Well, next door, actually. Kel, what are you saying? I bought Mandy's house. Oh, OH! What? Congratulations. Well, what with? I used my nest egg. I got a great price. I told them we were desperate for it. - You shouldn't tell them that. - Oh, no, stay with me, Brett. I wrong-footed them. I put in an offer well OVER the reserve. KATH: Oh, Kel J. Hooker, you're the best. We're gonna have to sell here, Kath. Oh, well, I'm over here. And soon I'll be over there. Can you organise a real estate agent today? - You know, get the ball rolling. - Oh, no way, Jose. I can sell this house myself. I did the TAFE course in Real Estate last year. SHARON: Guess what. We're gonna be on 'Deal'. KATH: Oh! KEL: You're kidding! I blitzed the interview. See, you're NOT stupid, Kim. Who said I was? I dunno. Oh, look, crack open another bottle of the Yellow, Brett. And can I put on some footy franks? Yeah, go for it, go for it. Well, we've got some exciting news too. Guess what. We've just bought Mandy's house. KIM AND SHARON: Oh, my God. You mean we're finally going to get this house to ourselves? Oh, no, no, Kim. We'll have to sell here. Oh, we'll have to clean your room out from top to bottom. OK. Just move it next door. What's my new room like? - Have I got an ensuite?  - No, Kim. You're not coming to Mandy's. It's just for Kel and me. It's our official love nest, isn't it, doll? Kel. KIM: Is this your idea, Kel? You thought you could waltz in here with your zip-up shoes and your yoghurt-and-muesli breath and rule the roost. But there was one big, fat problem in your way, wasn't there? Me. I'm smarter than you, I've got a higher IK than you, and you… can't… handle it. KATH: Oh, poo, Kim, I can smell your breath from here. You ruined everything, Kel. We were happy before you came along. Oh, well, I wasn't. I wasn't. Neither was I. Well, get stuffed, the pair of Youse. I'm not moving. Oh. So, what, Kim? You're gonna stay here with the new owners, are you? - Once we sell, you have to move. - IF you sell. Oh, we'll sell. And well. Once I've weaved my magic wand. Oh, gee, we could have a water feature over there. That's amazing. I don't believe it. The luck of the Irish. - What, Kel? - Hard rubbish day… tomorrow. (WATER GUSHES LOUDLY) (TUTS, GROANS) No! Kim! Kill you. KATH: Good afternoon. Here you go. Yes, have a browse. Oh, one for you, sir. Thank you. (MAN COUGHS) (WOMAN LAUGHS SCORNFULLY) G'day, foxy. Do you come with the house? Shh, Kel. Can I get your contact details, please, sir? - Oh, yes, certainly. It's Kel Knight. - Yes. - KIM: Mum! MUM!  - Kim? I'm not 'Mum', I'm the real estate agent! Guess what. 'Deal' just called. We're on, on Saturday. Saturday's the auction, Kim. I need you here. You're the dummy. Shut up, I am not. Anyway, I'm not gonna help you sell my inheritance. - I'll organise someone, Kath. - Oh, alright, Brett. Oh, well, that's great to hear, Sharon. So, no doubt all the girls down at the Sapphires are going to be rooting for you today. All the best. Now, you've also got someone else to root for you. - Your friend Kimmy on Briefcase 4. - Hi, Kim. Hi. - How you doing?  - Yeah, good. That's good. Now, listen, Kim, if it was you doing the deals today and you didn't have any bills to pay, no rent due or any of that, what would you spend your winnings on? Well, I have a Hummer fetish, Andrew. I love petrol guzzlers. I just love status symbols, basically. Fantastic, yeah. You and Schwarzenegger. Hummer fans. How about you, Sharon? What would you spend your money on? Um, well, I was gonna pay my rent. Um… I don't really know. - I don't really have a fetish. - OK. Good. Alright, well, we've got six cases to open. The Dealadrome is your oyster, Sharon. Let's deal. - (LOW-LEVEL CONVERSATION) - KATH: I think it's time to go. I think we could go. Don't know if we should wait for any more. Alright. (CLEARS THROAT) Well, hi, everybody. And welcome to the auction of Number 4, Lagoon Court, Fountain Lakes. I hope you've all brought your purses today, peoples, because this beautiful property is going to be sold. Now, firstly, I would like to congratulate the owners on their pre-auction makeover. - You should have seen it before. - (CHUCKLES) I won't keep you long, but I would like to point out some of the myriad of special features of this most-loved and cherished home. It has six bedrooms, peoples. Yes, not four, not five, but six bedrooms, including one in the garage and one in the toot. The best latte in town is less than 30 minutes power walk down the street at the award-winning Croutons on the Bay. I mean, talk about convenient. And city living, I hear you say. Well, the F19 freeway is on your doorstep… literally on your doorstep. If you don't believe me, just close your eyes and listen. It's that close, I tell you. Anyway, who'll start me off with a bid for this home, which is not so much a home but a complete lifestyle package that is Number 4, Lagoon Court, Fountain Lakes? Who'd like to start me off? Anybody. Anything. Sharon, it's crunch time. $10,000 on the table, right now, that's yours, if you want it. Or take a 50/50 shot on Briefcase 24. You could leave here with $20,000 or you could lose the lot. Sharon Strezlecki, deal or no deal? - AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Deal! Deal! - Kim? Kim, what do you think? Deal or no deal? Kim? KIM! Sharon, it's YOUR choice. No deal. No deal! Sharon, I can't believe it. That's a gutsy manoeuvre, turning down a bank offer of $10,000. - $10,000? You are unbelievable! - Kim, you weren't paying attention! (BOTH ARGUE) ANDREW: Girls. Girls, girls, girls. Please. It's almost news time. Time to do this thing. Sharon, time to open your case. Either there's 20 grand in there or 50 cents. Sharon Strezlecki, pop those locks. Well, look, I'll start us off, everyone. I'll start off at $400,000. At $400,000, let's say $400,000 and I'll take excrements of $50, peoples, excrements of $50. Thank you, sir. We have a bid. We have a bid there. At $400,050. We have $400,050. And… and going once at $400,050. The property's going once at $400,050. Going twice. Going twice. And sold… to the man in the cap. Thank you. At $400,050. Sir, would you like to step inside? Thank you for coming, everyone. The property is sold. Oh! We sold, we sold! $400,050. (HISSES) Kath! Kath! Kath! Kath! I'm so sorry, Kath, I thought you'd recognise me. I thought you knew I was bidding for you. What are you saying? That I've sold the house to myself? But that means I've got to pay stamp duty on two properties. Oh, no… I was being the vendor bid. But aren't I the vendor? Or am I the dummy? Oh, it's so confusing. What are we gonna do, Kel? I don't know. We have to settle on Mandy's house this week. Oh, jingies, it's a bloody disaster. My nest egg! (HYPERVENTILATES) Here, Kel, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe. Hang on a minute. No, hang on a minute. I think dummy bidding is actually illegal now. So, technically speaking, we could still hold Brett to the sale of the house. And he was unbeknownst. What? Really? Yes, if memory serves correctly, Section 23A, Clause 24 of the Real Estate Act of Victoria states that if a dummy bidder is unbeknownst to the auctioneer at time of bidding, all bids stand as thusly stated. Can I have the bag, Kel? But, Kath, Brett hasn't got two brazoos to rub together. Guess what. I just won $20,000 on 'Deal'. - KATH: Oh, my god! - BRETT: You're kidding! - Kim, that's just in the nick of time. - $20,000! Because Brett's just bought the house. What? Brett, you didn't tell me you were bidding. Oh, my god, you mean this house is mine? I didn't buy the house. We haven't got any money. Yes, we have. I just won 20 grand. No, Kim. $20,000? I mean, that's a deposit, Kel. You can get a loan. I'll have a word to the bank for you, Brett, get you the top interest rate. No, Kel, please, no, it's fine. Everything's honky-dory now, Kel. Everything's gonna be alright. Oh, let's go and peruse my beautiful new home. YOUR new home, Kath? Oh, sorry, Kel… OUR new home. Oh, come on. KATH: Oh, it's exciting… Kim… I won the money… I won the $20,000. - You said, "No deal." - No, I didn't. Kim, I don't want to buy this house. - I think your mum's wrong. - Shut up, Brett. Listen, Sharon. We only got on 'Deal' because of my looks. No way, Kim. We got through because I had the fastest fingers. (MOCKINGLY) "I had the fastest fingers." Well, you can get your fat fast fingers out of my footy franks and, frankly, out of my house. I want to knock that wall out straightaway. I reckon that would look great… (HYPERVENTILATES) Can we put the credenza on the other side? Can you do that now? (WHIMPERS) I'm gonna start packing up our room tonight. That'll be good. And then… Oh. There's Mandy's van. What's she doing back? So Mandy's agapants went bust? Pour me another wine, please, Kim. I think you've had enough, Mum. I'll tell you when I've had enough, thank you, Kim. OK. (SIGHS) I can't believe Mandy. Gazumping Kel on the front lawn right in front of me. Oh, I think it's disgusting behaviour. How could she renege on the sale and buy back her own house? It doesn't make sense. Oh, Kim, trust me, if you read the Real Estate of Victoria Act, it makes sense. The loopholes! You wouldn't believe. Yeah, well, I can't believe you gave Sharon back the 20 grand. Oh, Kim, after watching you both on 'Deal', Sharon won that money fair and square. You were hopeless. Spent the whole time watching yourself on the monitor. Well, I liked what I saw. Anyway, what's Sharon going to do with the money? Don't know, don't care. (DOOR OPENS) KATH: Oh, speak of the devil. SHARON: Success! - KIM: What are all the bags for? - Oh, I've been shopping, Kim. Yep, I am developing a shoe fetish with all my winnings. Oh, Sharon, that's very Sarah Jessica from 'Sex and the City', isn't it? Oh, Mrs D, maybe I'll find a Mr Big. - Yeah. And then you'll be Mrs Big. - That'd be right. Kim! Kim, I didn't forget you. Ooh! I have bought you a present. Ooh! Manolo Blahniks! Oh! Oh, they're different. Yeah. It's Manolo's new range. Manolo Blahnik for Kumfs. - Oh, they're nice, Kim. - They're different. - They're unusual, aren't they? - SHARON: They are. - They're different, unusual. - I thought you'd like that, actually. Oh, look at that. Look at the work. - KIM: They're stunning. - SHARON: Do you like them? Oh, wow, Manolo, you've done it again. - Mmm. I love them, Sharon. - I thought you'd like them. KATH: You're showing your papilloma there, Kim. - It's black as anything. - Shut up, Mum! KATH: Ooh! I'll get the Wart-Off. Kim, can you hurry up with that triple-cream brie, please? I shouldn't but I will. Alright, alright. Here it is. Oh, you look nice. You got on your Manolo. Yep, I've got my Manolo Blahnik for Kumfs, my Stella McCartney for Target, and my Alannah Hill for the two-dollar shop. And look at Cujo. She's wearing Stella McCartney for Dogs. Oh, gorgeous. Yeah. What have you come as, by the way? Did you get that from the roof? So '80s! No, it's new. It's Harry Who and George Gross. It's their Confusion label. It's a statement. More of a question… why? Ha! Kim. You know, it's funny, but since I wrote the blurb for the house, you know, for the auction, I've convinced myself about what a beautiful home this really is. I believed my own spin, which is nice. Well, it's not so beautiful for us, having Epponnee back in our bedroom. Oh, no, look! Cujo's done a doo-doo right there near Froggy. Pick that up, please. That's not Cujo's. That's Mandy's. Oh, god, Mandy's up to her old tricks again. Well, fling it back. It's bad feng-pooey. Mandy? I'd be appreciated if you'd keep Barney out of our yard too, please. (SLOP!) Ow! Ow, Mandy, ow! Oh, there's poo on Stella McCartney! Stella McCartney's got poo on her! Oh, well, fling it back. Right, Mandy. This is war. Here, look. Oh! - There's a little bit. - Yes. Oh, there's heaps of it. I'm just gonna use my hands. - That's Barney's, that's Barney's. - Oh, I'm not touching it. Here, we'll fling it onto HER designer labels… not! KATH AND KIM: Oh, it's nice. It's different. - KATH: Yeah, it's nice. - KIM: Yeah, it's unusual.
