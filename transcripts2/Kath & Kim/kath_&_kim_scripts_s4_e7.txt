 (GATE OPENS) What the hell? Are you serious? What are you doing? Oh! Not my Garnier Fructis firming cream! I'm kicking you out, Brett. You've been at it again. What? You just can't keep it in your pants, can you? Keep what in my pants? I'm not an ignoranus, Brett! Look at you! You reek! You've been through two bottles of Vulgari! You've been having spray-ons! Just admit it! - Alright, I admit it. - Oh! It only happened once and it's over. Get out of my life and my face, Brett.

 I'm sorry, Kim. Don't kick me out. Where will I go? What'll I do? Frankly, my dear, I don't give a fat rat's. Go to your ho's! I can't. It's over. She said I'm a dud root! Hi, Mandy. (SIGHS) Mandy! Your nuts are in my spa again! And look at the brushbox, Kim. It's hanging right over my antenna. I do love the Typhannn Knees toe ring Brett gave me. But it's not enough! Is that all our marriage meant to him? Not even a matching anklet. I don't believe it of Brett, Kim. Not again. Mum, a leper never changes his spots. It's not really Bretty's fault. I mean, there are a lot of little nymphos out there, Kim. - Hi, everyone. - KATH: Oh, hi, Sharon! - Well, congratulate me. Guess what? - What? As of today, it is official… I've been without a guy, and therefore celibate, for three months. Was there a choice? Oh, Sharon. No, I think it is a good thing, Mrs D. I mean, you know, no more throwing myself at anyone and everyone. I'm waiting for Mr Right. Ha! Well, that could take a long time, Sharon. Do you think it's wise to swear off guys? - You know what you're like. - Oh, no, I'm fine about it. I feel great. - Got any chocolate? - In the pantry, love. Oh, gee, I know I wouldn't last a day without it. Ha! I need my special cuddles, don't I, Kim? Oh, I shouldn't have to hear that. Oh, poor Kimmy. Are you alright? - No. - SHARON: Where is Bretty? Don't know, don't care. Oh! Pods! Oh! Do you wanna watch the cricket with me, Kim? Oh, well, girls, can you watch it upstairs, please? I need downstairs clear tonight for Kel and I. We have to have some one-on-one face time. We've got issues at the moment. (SIGHS) Thank you. Oh, gosh, that's the time? Gee. I better get a wriggle on. Kel will be home soon. I've got to put the dips out, put my face on… Gee, Sharon's really going through those Pods. You know, Kim, did you ever think to pop on a bit of lip gloss or a nice pair of ironed jeans for Brett before he came home from work? Because, you know, it might have made all the difference. No, I didn't, because I'm not a Stepford wife. No. There's nothing wrong with being a Stepford wife, Kim, and it was a very good film, despite what the critics said. You're mad, Mum. Yes, well, I might be mad, but at least I'm still married… to a guy who can't get enough of me… hello, you. Get stuffed. Kel! - The pre-stuffed free range, yeah. - Oh. Pistachio and leek. And squirt me an email just confirming that. Yeah, thanks. OK, 'bye. Kel… (SIGHS) I tell you, Kim. It's lucky Warney retired. No way I could watch the cricket. You know how his flipper razzes me up. You know Brett and me are gonna have to divide our assets? Bet he wants to get his hands on my Bumblelina. I know it's old and ugly, but I'm attached to it. Just so glad we got a pre-nup. Pre-nup? What's that? Don't you know anything, Sharon? It's like, you know before you get married, and you've said, "Yep," you might've at some stage have previously said "Nup." So that nup is previously yep so the pre-nup still stands. Oh, Freddie Flintoff is a hottie, isn't he? Shrek. Spunk. Oh, my god! Kim! I think I wanna tonk a Pom! Pass the Pods, Kim! Quick! Quick! Sharon, I think we better change the channel. I think so, Kim. Oh, 'Gladiator's on… let's watch that. Or would Russell razz you up too much? Russell Crowe… let me think… Nah, should be fine. ('INSATIABLE' BY DARREN HAYES PLAYS) ♪ Turn the lights down low Take it off, let me show ♪ My love for you Insatiable ♪ Turn me on… ♪ Kel, do you think I should hack Mandy's roots or her branches? You know, the ones that are on our side of the fence. Just put some peanut sauce on them. That should do it. What, Kel? OK, Pete. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Thanks, mate. - Oh, Kel! - Oh, sorry, Kath. Sorry, Kath. Oh! (LAUGHS) Oh… Mmm, that feels nice. What do you call that, Kel? Sorry, Kath, that's my memory stick. Which reminds me, I've gotta download those marinade ideas onto the website. Oh, Kel, you know, you growing your business, going online, getting your BlackBerry, your Bluetooth, your podcast, your websites… Ha! I hardly get a look-in these days. You know, I feel like I'm rabbiting on saying nothing to no-one half the time. (LAUGHS) (FAINT TAPPING) Hmm, is that rain, doll? Kel! Can you put the BlackBerry down for five minutes and boogie with your wife, please? Actually, the battery is going. I better go plug it in. Oh! Kel, finish your dance! Oh, forget it. I'll just dance on my own, won't I? "Yes, thanks for tea tonight, Kath. It was lovely. It was beautiful. "And you look foxy as anything…" (CRASH!) KIM: Mum! Something's happened to the TV reception! - Oh, no! It's Mandy's bloody brushbox! - Oh! (GROANS) (YAWNS) Ohh… I-I don't think you should stay, Bretty. It's… it's not a good time for me. And, you know, I am Kimmy's second-best friend. I got nowhere else. Please! (SIGHS) Well, OK. If it's just for a few days, I should be fine. You know, I mean, I am here for you, Bretty. You know, as I say to the girls at netty, "If you need." I feel so guilty. What's wrong with me? Maybe Kim was right. Maybe I can't keep it in my pants. Don't say that, Bretty. Please don't say that. I have to go. Oh, Mandy! Mandy Patimkin! I can see you! Don't try and hide! Oh, well, don't you shake your head at me, please. I'm entitled to TV reception, Mandy. Oh, so what are you gonna go and do? Ring the council, are you? Alright, well, you go and do that. Get them over here and I'll show them how your roots are dividing my clivias. Mum, you're gonna kill yourself up there. Why can't Kel do that? Kel? Huh! Kel's too busy with his BlackBerry to do this. Or anything else, but don't go there, girlfriend. I'm depressed. I need some retail therapy. Come on. I wanna go to Fountain Gate. Yeah, alright. I do actually want to go and get some new gear. You know, get a bit of a new look for Kel. Try and vamp up my act a bit. And you've gotta take back those DVDs, Kim. Yeah, alright. First can we have breakfast at Typhannn Knees? (SIGHS) (MUZAK PLAYS SOFTLY) Oh! Look at the diamond-encrusted braces! Where? There… just beside the fascinators. Oh, braces… they don't look big enough to hold your pants up, Kim. No, Mum, they're braces for your teeth. - They're called 'grills'. - Oh, yes, I know what you mean. A la Chamillionaire and Ja Rule. - Yeah, yeah. It's mouth bling. - Oh, mouth bling! That's nice! - It is nice. It's different. - It's different. - It's unusual. - It is. No, it's unusual. It's nice. Mmm. You know, Mum, I do miss Brett's presents around the house. Oh, so do I. He always lit up the room. No… No, his guilt presents from Typhannn Knees. Guess that's the upside of being married to a pants man. (SIGHS) You know, Kim, I still can't believe Brett's done it again. I always gave him the benefit of the doubt. He's made me look a fool, actually. Well, that hat isn't helping. What? Oh, yeah. I bought it for Kel. He's gotta notice me in this. Gee, we haven't had our rocks off for days. I tell you, I am one frustrated lady at the moment. Eugh! Oh, I love that mouth bling! Oh, Kim, there's Sharon! What's she doing here? KIM: Sharon! Oh, hi, Mrs D. Hi, Kim. Sure you got enough there? Um, Kimmy, could I please speak to you about Brett? I don't wanna hear that word again, Sharon. Which word? Oh. Um… anyway, I better pay for these. Hi. That's $57, please. Just keep the change. Ooh! I'd hate to be the guy who cops Sharon when she finally blows. (BREATHES DEEPLY) Hi, Bretty! (GROANS AND BLOWS) - I got us some tea. - Oh, great. Yeah, it's a foot-long from Subway. Oh, Kim never let me have a foot-long the whole time we were married. - Oh, really? - Oh, it's my pleasure, Bretty. - Thanks. - Yep. Got us some dessert too. Oh, beauty. Could I put the cricket on? (SCREAMS) No! Don't put the cricket on, Brett! Hello, you! Just a minute, love. Kel. Notice anything? Just a sec… Here, have a feel of this. It's so fluffy. Kel? Kel! Oh, forget it. I don't know why I bother anymore. Here, put it on your BlackBerry. I'm sure it'll look really foxy in it. What? Kath! What's wrong? Sharon, where the bloody hell are you? I need you to come to Fountain Gate with me tomorrow. I'll pick you up about 10:00. Bye. (TOILET FLUSHES, MOBILE BEEPS) Would you like some Viennetta, Bretty? Oh, thanks, Sharon. That'd be nice. Oh! (LAUGHS) - 'Scuse fingers. - No probs. - Oh, you're a little duffer. - (CHUCKLES) Oh, I know, Kel. I just don't like playing second banana to a BlackBerry. Second banana? You're my number one lady finger and don't you forget it. (LAUGHS) Oh, Kel. So tell me, was it the fluffy bolero that got you in in the end? Nah, it's the bowler hat worn on that jaunty angle. - Oh! Talk about hot! - I knew it! You know, I saw it in the fun shop, Kel, and something just clicked and I had to have it. And so do I. Come here, you. Oh, Kel. (DOORBELL RINGS) Oooh! Who's that? It's Mandy and the police. (LOUD KNOCKING AT DOOR) What are they doing here? Oh, no! Gee, that was a great tea. Thanks, Sharon. No worries, Brett. Thanks for your ear too. I hope I didn't chew it off. Oh, yeah. No worries. - Goodnight, Brett. - Oh, yeah. Goodnight, Sharon. (SCREAMS) Don't come any closer, Brett! You alright, Sharon? I think you should get out! GET OUT NOW WHILE YOU CAN! What's the matter, Sharon? I've run out of chocolate. Oh, you don't understand. I'm a pants man. I can't help myself. (SCREAMS) BRETTY! (CRASH!) Ooh! Oh, where are you going? I'm going back to Typhannn Knees with Sharon. I just can't get that mouth bling out of my head. So what'd the cops say? Well, they said it's an 'eritage-listed tree, almost four years old. I only hacked off one branch. I would've poisoned her roots. Yeah, well, I tried that. It didn't work. Anyway, now they're saying that infection could set in and ruin the whole tree. Mandy could sue the pants off me. Speaking of pants off… hello, you. Foul! Anyway, I'm off. Mum, can you keep an ear out for Epponnee? Yes, alright. Bye. Oh! You look nice. Is that new? Oh, this? No, it's 100 years old, Kel, but thanks for noticing. Oh, my bowler! Kel! Oh. Sorry, love. I'm turning it off now. Gee, it's blowy. (CRUNCH!) Kel! The tree! Oh, my god. Oh, my god! (BOTH SCREAM) (SCREAM) (BOTH SCREAM) (CRASH!) (BLACKBERRY RINGS, SPLASHES) (GASPS) Oh! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! (GASPS) My BlackBerry! Where's my BlackBerry? (GASPS) It's not what it looks like. Well, it looks like you've been having sex! Oh, well, then it is what it looks like. - I think I'm gonna be sick! (SOBS) - SHARON: Kim! I can explain! Oh. Hell, Kel, we could've been killed today. Yeah, well, my BlackBerry's died. Oh, good riddance. You're spending way too much time pushing its buttons and not mine. I know, I know. - Oh, I better go pop some pants on. - OK, doll. Actually, I'd better recharge this Bluetooth. It's getting a bit low. Oh, Kel, your wet bathers. You gonna put those in the dryer, please? - Mum! MUM! - Kim, what's happened? Oh, poor Brett. Poor Brett?! - He can't help himself, Kim. - But with Sharon! Oh, Sharon was so pent up, Kim. She was bound to blow and jump on the first thing that moved. I just thank my lucky stars I wasn't around in my bowler. (DOOR SLIDES) Hi, Mrs D. Kim. I need to go to the toilet, and when I come back, I wanna see you gone. Oh, Sharon… You and Brett? I know, Mrs D, but, you know, I've always had a thing for Bretty. Yeah, well, he is a damned attractive guy. Yeah, but, you know, it is funny, I have to say… last night, my long-held dream turned into a very short, unsatisfactory nightmare. - What do you mean, Sharon? - It was a total fizzer. I mean, Brett is hopeless at it, Mrs D. Poor Kim. - What are you talking about? - First you steal my husband… I'm sorry, Kim! Get out, Sharon! I never wanna see you or your carbuncles ever again. Well… but Kimmy, I mean, you told me that your marriage was over and… I'd run out of chocolate! As if that's some sort of excuse! (BOTH ARGUE OVER EACH OTHER) Time out! Time out! Time out, please, ladies. Now, Kim, look at me, please. Look at me. Look at me. Now, I've got one word to say to you, Kim… 'dud root'. Hi. Um… I've come to beg for forgiveness… for the terrible thing that I did. Yeah, it was pretty terrible, Brett, but, um, I forgive you. I meant for Kim to forgive me. I can change. Oh, Brett, it's gonna take a lot more than just another Typhannn Knee box to win Kim back. - She's not that shallow. - Shut up, Mum. Yes, I am. Oh! The diamond braces. The mouth bling. Oh, Kim, go and try them on. Come on. Oh… I love you, babe. I really wanna come back. So… What do you say? (SPEAKS WITH DIFFICULTY) I'll say this, Brett… you must've been desperate to sleep with Sharon. You're shit, Brett. Yes, I will give you a second chance, but I swear, if you slip up next time, there'll be serious consequences. Was that… Was that a yes? Shut up and kiss me, Brett. Please forgive me too, Kim! Please! Can we just forget that it ever happened? 'Cause it practically didn't. Yeah, I was thinking about you the whole time. - Yeah, so was I. - Yeah, we both were. Oh, please, Kim! Oh, Kim, look at the face on it. Alright, Sharon, but I'm dropping you from second-best friend down to sixth. Oh, good girl! Ohh… - They're nice, aren't they? - (ALL AGREE) - KATH: Yeah, unusual. - KIM: Yeah, they're sparkly. Oh, well, we've all had our fill of dud roots this week, haven't we, Kim? Oh, shut up about Brett, Mum! I'm not talking about Brett. I'm talking about Mandy's tree. I mean, look at the belvedere. It's rooted, absolutely. I tell you what, I'm loving Brett's guilt presents. Look at these earrings. They were to make up for the Bolton twins. This classic bangle is for Kelly. Yep, and now you've got your grills and your toe ring. I mean, you are very lucky to have a guy with such good taste, Kim. I'd love the matching necklace. Mmm, careful what you wish for! I know! I do have to say, though, Kim, I am very proud of you, the way you've forgiven Sharon. I mean, that wasn't easy. And funnily enough, you letting Sharon have a go with Brett seems to have given her her confidence back. Tell me about it. She's right on the prowl. You know, going for anything that moves. - Or doesn't. - Yeah. Look, as long as she doesn't move on to Kel, because I tell you, he is testosterone on three legs at the moment. - Eugh! - Oh, no, Kim… - He's back big-time. - Gee. Last night the bowler got a working out, let me tell you. I shouldn't have to hear that. No, it was beautiful, you know. It was… No! I don't wanna… No! - Incredible. You know, his stamina… - Arggh! You know, and he's inventive, which I love. No! Mum! Brett could learn a thing or two from Kel. - Oh, I'm gonna be sick! - No, it's not. It's beautiful. Arggh! I'm going in! - What is so wrong… - Stop it! With two very attractive baby boomers who like to go for it like rabbits? There's nothing wrong with it. Oh, Kim! Guess who's coming to Fountain Lakes next week? Oh, my God! Shane Warne! This is a dream come true! For you, isn't it… to be with two hornbags like us? Best I've ever been with. - Yeah? - Oh, I imagine. I guess it's a bit of a highlight for you in your career. Definitely. Right up there. - What about the Ashes? You know… - Oh, forget the Ashes. Yeah… This is top-notch. That's right. Being in Fountain Lakes. KATH AND KIM: Oh, it's nice. It's different. - KATH: Yeah, it's nice. - KIM: Yeah, it's unusual.
