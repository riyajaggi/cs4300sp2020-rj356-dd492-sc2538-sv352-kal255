 ANNOUNCER: (ON TV) They talk about our culture and they talk in our language, but are they really us? Or will the new face of Australia be Asian? That's so true. If we let any more in, there'll be no Australians living here. Oh, it's such a beat-up, Kim. There's plenty of room for everyone. Ow! Brett, don't! It's my couch! I'm just scared. I'm scared for Epponnee. - KEL: Kath, it's back on. - Oh, yeah, coming, Kel. Turn that rubbish off, Kim. Come and watch 'Mary Bryant'. It's terrific Australian drama. Here you go, doll. Oh-ho-ho! Mmm! Kath, your chicken feet, 'Mary Bryant'…

 life doesn't get much better than this. They, uh, just caught her again. Oh, poor Mary! KATH: Gee, you'd think she'd give her face a bit of a wash. It was pretty hard to keep clean in that climate. You know, Kel, my family, on my mum's side, the Quail side, were from the Top End. Yeah, they were actually quite well-to-do. So you're from money? - Oh, we lost it all, of course. - (LAUGHS) I remember Mum telling me about some scandal in the closet. It was a totally foreboden subject. You know, I don't know one thing about my background… you know, where I'm from, way back. Well, Knight… I mean, that'd be a noble name, from England. Hmm. Yeah, you've probably got royalty in there somewhere, Kel. I wouldn't mind knowing a bit more about my roots. You know, Kath, it's funny, 'cause I've always thought I was a bit of a nob. - Mmm. - Yeah. A cut above. Well, why don't you do a bit of research… get on the net, look up some websites. Mmm, I think I will. Oh, not now, Kel. You've gotta finish your chicken feet, watch 'Mary Bryant'. Oh, look. - They're washing her face. - That's a good girl, Mary. There's so many Asians here. I mean, where are the Australians? Kim! That's very racist. They ARE Australians. Yeah, well, hardly anyone looks like me. Ha! Lucky them. Is that supposed to be funny? 'Cause it's not funny what's happening out there, Mum. - Open your eyes. - Oh, shut up, you stupid girl. Oh, look here. Look, this is Rolf de Heer's newie… 'Ten Canoes'. It's all about the Aborigines. Well, exactly my point. Why don't those people go back to where they came from? (LAUGHS) I think you'll find, if the Aborigines went back to where they came from, we'd be moving out. Oh, look. There's Dr Ng and Gung Ho. Hello! I'm doing noodles tonight. Next, please. Kim! Three packets of squash-fly biscuits. No wonder you're 'yuge'. (SCANNER BEEPS) What? I've only got 12 in my basket and she's got 12. That adds up to… 24. MAN: Are you sure? There's two of us checking out at the same time. Do you have FlyBuys? Sorry? FlyBuys. Oh, you mean 'FloyBoys'? I can't understand you. Speak Australian. Yes, I do. How are you, Julie? (WHISPERS) Good, thanks. - Kath? Come and have a look at this. - Wow, I don't believe it. - What is it, Kel? - Guess what? What? Apparently, I had a Great-Uncle Neville John Knight who was the Governor-Surveyor in Horsham, surveyor from Horsham to Colac in 1865. Oh! That's beautiful, isn't it, Kel? It's not exactly noble, though, is it? Oh, they're here. I'll find 'em. (WHISTLES) (DOOR SLIDES OPEN) Oh, hi, Sharon. - You alright, love? - No, not really. Oh, I've just been thinking, you know, Mrs D, since Kel's doing his family tree and all that, about my mum and, you know, how she abandoned me when I was just a baby. Aw! You never talk about your mum, do you? Do you know where she is now, love? Uh, she went to England. I know that. Mmm. Maybe I should try and contact her again. Yeah, why not? Couldn't hurt. I mean, she would probably want to know that I've turned out pretty good, you know, and found some success… well, at least in the sporting arena. - I'm sure she would, Sharon. - KEL: Ah! Here it is, Kath. I knew it. I've got a cousin who owns a castle. - Oh, really? - Yep. Uh, "Jumping castle for hire… parties and fetes." 465 Boundary Road, Chirnside. Well, you're getting closer, Kel. Why don't you try googling your mum, Sharon? Actually, that's a really good idea, Mrs D. - I might try that. - KATH: Mmm. Is Kim here? Yeah, she's in the good room, glued to that dreadful 'Border Security'. 'Verdel-ho'… that's the wine I need. Kath, it says you can do a thing called a DNA test to see if you have any blue blood. That sounds interesting, doesn't it? Yeah. - SHARON: Hi, Kim. - Shh! Mum, we should get a flagpole out the front, like everyone else. KATH: What? Aren't you proud to be Australian? Yes, of course I'm proud to be Australian. I just don't think we should bang on about it, that's all. I think we should when our very way of life is under-threatened. Oh! Kim, you're beginning to sound like a Nazi. Me a Nazi? You're the Nazi. Well, yes, I am a style-Nazi but that's about as far as it goes. I mean we are threatened by illegal aliens. KEL: Kath? Aliens! Gawd, Kim! "Bone me up, Scotty." (LAUGHS) (SOBS) What's wrong now? Oh, you know. Just… watching you and your mum fighting. It's so nice. I think I will contact my mum in England. Well, why would she want to see you? I mean, she's probably got a whole new family by now and hasn't thought about you for years. That is so mean! You don't know that, Kim! Anyway, even if she does have another whole new family, I'm sure, if she saw me, she would love me. Oh, are you? Well, I wouldn't be too up yourself. Anyway, can you be quiet? This is actually important. MAN: (ON TV) Are these your bananas? Mmm. A quantitative surveyor? Is that different, is it? Yeah, alright. 1783, yeah. Look, Kel, I've really gotta go. OK, doll. Bye. (ENDS CALL) What's that on your face, Kim? It's the Aussie flag! Oh! Stupid girl! Putting a flag on your face! It's not even Australian. It's New Zealand. (DOOR SLIDES OPEN) - Guess what. - You found your mum? No. Not yet. But guess what. I have found out that I have got a sister. Oh! Oh, my god! - Sharon, that's exciting! - I know. I know. And apparently, she's absolutely gorgeous. - So, no family resemblance, then? - Oh! No, Kim. She is a model and she sounds very nice. But the best part is she's coming to Melbourne! When? What? You will not believe it! Tomorrow! Oh! You're kidding me! Oh, that's surreal! - Unbelievable! - I know, I know, I know. It is meant to be, Mrs D. She's been working in Sydney. And then she's gonna be transiting through Melbourne just for the day, en route to South Molle Island. South Molle? Oh, that's right. Virgin's re-routing itself through Tulla now. So, anyway, I said that I would meet her at the airport and, you know, show her round for the day. KATH: Aw! That's nice. Yeah. I'm so nervous. Kim? Yes, Sharon? Would you please come to the airport with me? You know, hold my hand, sort of? Oh, yuck! As if! Oh, go on, Kim. Alright, Sharon, I'll come, only because I want to see who's actually coming into this country. KEL: I've done six generations of the Queensland branch and this is the Adelaide branch. It's mind-numbing, isn't it, Brett? - It sure is. - Yeah. I'm still researching. This is the Melbourne branch now. Oh, have a look at this. I'm just downloading it. - Now, it won't take long. - I'd better go. I promised to take Epps to the park. - Oh, OK. - Yeah. No worries. Take her down the park. (LAUGHS) You're lucky having Epps, aren't you? She's like a little twig on your family tree, isn't she? I suppose your family tree stops with you, doesn't it, Kel? No kids. Oh, yeah. No twigs. I guess I'm just an old, dead stump in the middle of the garden, aren't I? Oh! Yeah. But I don't mind, you know. I quite like it. Somewhere for the birds to come and sit, you know. - Yeah. Anyway, better go. - Go kick the footy, Epps, eh? - Yeah. Kick the footy. - That's great stuff. Yeah. Great. Kath? What are you doing? Oh! Well, you know, with all this talk about families, etc, etc, I remembered about all these old photos I've got. Oh, gee! She's a bit of an old-fashioned fox. Who's that? Oh, yeah. That's my Great-Great-Great Aunt Bart. Oh. Ho-ho! - Gee, she's got a mean little mug. - Ha! - I don't know who that is? - Mmm. Look at this one, Kel. This is the old family station up in the Northern Territory. Right. Who's the, uh, Aboriginal lady? Where? There. Oh, no, Kel, that's my great-great grandmother, Agnes. - Everyone called her 'Mum'. - She's not Aboriginal. I think she is, Kath. - Oh. Do you think? - Yeah. Gee, that'd mean I'd have some Koori in me. - Well, you might have. - Oh. Why don't you get a DNA test done, doll? They'll do it in a day. Kim! Is that her? Karen? She's going the wrong way! Oh, my god, Kim! I think it might be her! Oh! (ENGLISH ACCENT) Hello! It's me, Karen! Oh, Sharon, I knew you'd be pretty. Oh, no, Karen, I'm not Sharon. That's Sharon. Karen. Oh, hello. Um, I bought you a koala. Oh! I don't like it! Put it down! Nah, get rid of it! Oh, it's a fluffy! I thought it was a real one! Oh, it's a fluffy! I still don't like it. Um… so… Karen… you're my sister. Half. Yeah, though I can't see the family resemblance at all. I think I look more like her. Same nails. Oh, snap! I just love your green and golds. Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi! (LAUGHS) Oh, my god. You've got a Louise Vuitton roll-on. Yeah, I got it in Dubai Airport at the duty-free. Oh, Sharon, is it? You couldn't take my trolley, could you? You know, I would but… nails. So, anyway, there's a very funny story about… Oh, yeah. Well, I've got a good sense of humour… - Um, Karen? - Yes. Is there anything special that you would like to do while you're in Melbourne? Yeah. I want to meet Hugh Jackmans. Can we meet him? And Heath Ledgers and Keith Urbans. I want to meet them. We'll see, but first we're gonna treat you to the ultimate Melbourne experience. A stuffed potato at Fountain Gate and then we're gonna hit Alannah Hill. Hit who? I tell you what I do wanna do, girls. I want to snog an Aussie guy. (LAUGHS) Me too. We are definitely sisters. Half. (SIGHS) Right. So I need a piece of hair, nails… and the swab. (THINKS) So, my great-great grandmother, Agnes, could have been the foreboden subject. Wow. So I could actually have Aboriginal blood. Well, it makes sense, with my curly hair and all, even though it is a perm. I wonder what my tribe is. I wonder who my mob is. KAREN: Four pieces of roti and a 'muscleman' beef. And a samosa. Two samosas. Sorry about all the illegal immigrants, Karen. They are not illegal, Kim. Yeah, well, they bloody well should be. It's nothing compared to back home. A lot of them don't even try and talk English proper. Their accents are all 'fick' and awful. Haven't got any rice left here. Ooh! Oh, I could snog him. Ooh! Tasty! So, you are a model, Karen? Oh, yeah. Plus-14 catalogue model, you know. - For magazines mostly. - Wow! - What sort of magazines? - Oh, the biggies. Yeah, 'Fatmopolitan', 'Marie Fat', 'Fattity Fair'. Yeah. Yeah. I work a lot in America, as I'm actually considered thin there. Oh! Maybe I could do that. You know… be a model! I don't think so, Sharon. You do need to be pretty! - God, you're tragic, Sharon. - (LAUGHS) She's delusional! (DIDGERIDOO PLAYS) Oh! Gee, I'm loving the look of these traditional recipes. They're a bit fiddly for me. Oh, fiddly's fine for me. (LAUGHS) No, I'll take that, thank you. Oh! Gee, I'd kill for a Jarrah Vienna. There's a bush tucker cafe next door. - Oh! - You can get a Jarrah Pitjantjatjara. Oh, really? No, I'm only jokin'. Oh. (LAUGHS) But it's a nice idea, though. - Ooh! - KATH: Oh! Wow. What's this lift called, Stephen? - The koala lift. - Oh! I feel more like a possum. And, Stephen, would I normally have to go topless for this, because I don't mind. With spirit fingers going. And step. (TRADITIONAL ABORIGINAL MUSIC PLAYS) Step. And kick the earth and feel the earth! And kick the earth and feel the earth! Step. Kick. (MUSIC STOPS) Oh, wow! That's amazing, Stephen. Where's that from? Is that from Almond Land? No. 'Hello Dolly'. Oh. (CHUCKLES) I want you to let yourself go. And I want you to respond any way you'd like to and feel the music. I want to see the essence of Kath. OK. Alright. (LOW DIDGERIDOO NOTE PLAYS) (TURNS MUSIC OFF) Stop. I've… I've seen enough. I have to say, Stephen, I'm a yuge fan of the Bangarra Dance Company. Well, now you've seen my chops, do you think there's any chance for a lead for me soon? - Oh, I'll keep you in mind, Kath. - Oh, OK. That'd be really great. I'd appreciate it. So I actually have a lot of different looks for my modelling. For instance, we've got Cathy Zeta. (GASPS) Oh, wow! See? Yeah. We've got Irma Thuman. Oh. See? And my favourite… J.Lo Lopez. Oh, my god! You look exactly like her. I do. I do. She said the same thing herself. And look how snoggable I look. Karen, you might want to wax your welcome mat. It's creeping right up your back. I do not have a welcome mat, actually. Do I, Kim? Ignore it, Karen. Sharon's got a yuge mean streak. Kim! I do not! So, um, Karen… - Yeah? - …does Mum ever mention me? No. Never said nothin' about you. In fact, I never even knew you existed till now. (LAUGHS) - What's Mum like? - Oh, she's lovely. Yeah, we're very close. Well, she dotes on me. I'm her princess. Yeah, she buys me anything I want. Well, I've always had the best of everything… pony club, holidays in Ibiza. You name it, Sharon. Karen, try this on. I don't believe it. I do not believe this! We are exactly the same size! Oh, come into the bathroom. I want to tong your hair. I can't wait to go to the bathroom and have me hair done. I've got an idea! I've got an idea! (BOTH TALK AND LAUGH) (SIGHS) What are you doing, Mrs D? Oh, I'm just doing my dot painting, Sharon. (SIGHS) Oh, are you alright, love? Where's Karen? Oh… upstairs with Kim. She's just not very nice to me. Mmm, yeah, I know what you mean. She struck me as being a bit of a P in the A. Oh! Can I have a biscuit? Oh, yes. They're Kim's. She bought those. Yeah. It just hasn't really panned out the way I imagined, Mrs D. I know. Well, that's family, Sharon. I mean, you can't choose them. Well, actually, you can, because I have chosen you and Kim. - Aw! - You are my real family. - This is where the love is. - Sharon! You bloody oaf! That was my last low-GI squash-fly. Well, I didn't know! Oh, well, you never know! (KAREN AND KIM SHOUT) You don't know! - She had to have it. - Time out, please. Time out. Now, Kimmy, look at me, please. Sharon, look at me. Now, Karen, look at me, please. Look at me. Now, I've got one word to say to you. What do you think of Melbourne? It's alright. Though I never got to meet no-one famous, you know, like Keith Urban. Oh! We've got Keith Urban's doppelganger right here. - Hi, Kel. - Kel, this is Karen. Sharon's half-sister from England. Lovely to meet you, Karen. Oh! When's the baby due? I'm not pregnant, Keith! Oh, what a nob! Thank you, Karen. I certainly hope I am. Come on, Karen. We'd better get you to the airport. We don't want you to miss your flight. Well, goodbye, Karen. Nice to meet you. Now I'll never get to snog an Aussie hunk. Hi! - Oh, maybe I spoke too soon. - What's your name, gorgeous? Oh, Karen, this is my husband, Brett. Brett, this is Karen… Sharon's half-sister. Hi, Karen. (GROWLS) Kath, I got your DNA results. - I picked them up from the lab. - Oh, gee, that was quick, Kel. KATH: Kim, tea's ready. Yeah, I'm here. Oh, Karen left one of her wigs. Oh. Oh, gee, she was great. I love English people. They're so classy. You know, you can really see, when you meet someone like her, where we come from. Oh, speaking of where we come from, Kim, I found out some very exciting news today. I've discovered that I'm a person of colour. An Aborigine. And therefore, Kim, so are you. What? What are you saying? I'm saying, Kim, that you and I are a couple of blackfellas. What… Aboriginal? You're kidding. - You'd better get used to it. - I think it's fantastic. Wow. To think that I've got roots here that are 1,000 years old. I suppose it explains a lot… why I look so good in Cathy Freeman's running suit. Yeah, alright, Cathy. You can put down your magazine, please, and eat. It's delicious. It's an emu vol-au-vent with a green-ant coulis. Kel, why the long face? I've just been back 20 generations in the Knight family and I couldn't find one noble person in the history of the Knights. Oh, Kel! Well, how can that be, love, when you're so darn interesting? Am I, Kath? - Well, I just don't know. - Oh, Kel. Well, what about on your mum's side of the family? Have you looked there? What was your mum's name? Beryl Aniston. Aniston? You mean as in Jennifer? Yeah. Well, you know, now you say it, I can see a resemblance. So can I. Here. Put this wig on. Oh, my god. Mum, look at this! Same nose. Yeah. Same chin. Oh! Well, Kel, there's your blue blood. I mean, Jennifer Aniston… that's showbiz royalty! We should go to LA and look her up. Yes. Oh, why not? We could stay in her Hollywood mansion. Oh, wow! I always wanted to meet Brad Pitt. No, no. She's divorced from Brad Pitt. She's with Vince Vaughn now. Actually, I think they've broken up too. I tell you, Kim, those DNA tests are really amazing. The things I found out about my ancestors' roots! Oh! Gee, they got around. And no wonder I love orange and I'm so good at making chicken feet, because part of me is 'Mandarine'. KIM: What, so now I'm Chinese? God! That leaves no-one else to bag. Except maybe the 'Mooslims'. No, no, no, no. Because your great-great-grandfather on your dad's side is actually a Malaysian Islamite. Yeah, he was one of the 'Koala Lumpan' Bang Bangs. - On Dad's side? - Yeah. How can they find that out from your DNA? Oh, it's amazing the things they can tell you. - Mmm. - Yeah. Anyway, so has Sharon heard from Karen? No. It's interesting, though. You know, she was gorgeous to my face? I actually caught her going through my make-up, trying to nick my Napoleon Perdis. It really taught me that, you know, maybe some white people aren't very nice either. - Yeah. - I don't even think she's a model. Oh, no, she is, because, look, here she is, all over the 'Marie Fat' this month. - Ah! (CAMERA CLICKS REPEATEDLY) - PHOTOGRAPHER: Fantastic. - Thanks a lot. I bet these pictures are (BLEEP). KATH AND KIM: Oh, it's nice. It's different. - KATH: Yeah, it's nice. - KIM: Yeah, it's unusual.
