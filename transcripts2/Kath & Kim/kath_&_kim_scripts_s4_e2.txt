 Actually, you better make it 1,000. Yes, alright. - Oh, Eppies. Good girl! - (EPPONNEE GURGLES) Kim, can you get off the phone, please? I need to call Oz Knits. No! I'm on hold with the party planners. I'm just getting some prices for Epponnee's birthday party. Party planners? Kim, that's a bit OTT, isn't it? Mum, she's turning the big 01. Come on... Oh, Kim, she'd be happy with a little bit of sauce on a saveloy, the poor little bugger. Was that all you did for me, was it? Oh, no, we couldn't have a party for you, Kim. You were a biter. We all lived in fear.

 Well, Epponnee's popular at creche, so she's having a party. Listen what P Diddly did with the twins. He had a gangster rap theme, and all the babies packed pieces in their diapers. Oh, don't say 'diapers', Kim. We're not American. Wish we were. They have so much fun there. (SCOFFS) Stupid girl. One idea I had was taking them to Gold Class and then to Intencity to play video games, but I don't think that's gonna work, 'cause most of them can't use their disposable thumbs yet. Well, why don't you have a theme party, Kim? Like, you know, what's Epps's favourite TV show at the moment? 'SpongeBob SquarePants' or 'Hi-5'? Oh, no, no, no. She's into 'Desperate Housewives' now. Oh, snap! Good girl, Epps. Well, we could do something here. I could come as Teri Hatcher, 'cause I am a bit like the Teri Hatcher of Lagoon Court. Yes! And I could be Marcia Cross! Yeah! Well, you've got the 'cross' bit right. - Yeah! - And Sharon can be Felicity Half Man! Epponnee, do you want to be Eva Longoria for your birthday party? (CRYING) Nup. She doesn't like the idea. No. But what about just a celebrity party, you know? The babies could choose which celebrities they want to go as. Oh, yes! And we could all go as couples. You know, like, I could go as... Who could I go as? I know! Peter Overton and Jessica Rowe. They're everywhere at the moment. - Who? - (BEEPING DIAL TONE) Oh, bum, they cut me off! Oh, good. I need the phone. Thank you, Kim. (BUTTONS BEEP) Hello? Yes, Oz Knits. Yes, it's Kath Day-Knight here. I'm just ringing up about a pumpkin shrug that I had on order. (FUNKY MUSIC) Oh, you look nice, Kel. Where are you off to? Oh, thanks, Sharon. It's the Fountain Gate retailers' awards night. Yeah. Oh! That's right. And you're up for the big one, aren't you? - Retailer of the Year award! - Yeah. I reckon you'll win, Kel. No, Sharon, I won't win. Gee. I'm up against The Tie Rack, Petra Hair Care... Not a hope in hell. It's fun to go, though. But you can't take these things too seriously. Come on, Kath. I don't want to be late! - Yes, I'm here! - Oh! - Oh, wow, Mrs D! - You look stunning, Kath. Yeah. Not too much? How's my make-up? Lose the shrug? What do you think? Stop your fussing, you look fine. Let's go. Come on. Well, I don't know, do I, Kel? If you win, there'll be photographers, the paparazzi. I might get papped! I won't win. Hey, well, you might win, you don't know! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Oh, god! The Fountain Gate retailers' awards, I mean, could it get any more tragic? I know, Trude, but it's work, we've got to do it. I know, it's just I'm tired. I've been out too many nights this week. I don't know how you do it, Trude. Well, I can't say no at the mo. Friday night was dinner with the girls from Curves, Saturday was Year Five trivia night at school, and last night was the Timbertop reunion, which was, you know, great, but late. Yeah, I know. Well, Adrian and I had the beyondblue do. - Oh, that depressed organisation? - Yeah. Look, it was for the depressed, but god, it was fun! (BOTH CHUCKLE) You know, Dickie Tognetti was there. - Ooh, the beautiful violinist? - Mmm. Yes, and, you know, I had had a few cheekies, I must admit, and I just thought, "Look, no, I'm gonna go and talk to you." - Because he was on his own. - Oh, god, you're good. - Was he gorgeous? - No, he was frosty as hell. But you know, I love that in a guy. Don't know anyone here... Oh, there's Daryl! Daryl! Daryl, hi! Come here, Daryl, save us! How are you? Hello, girls. How you doing? Prue, you look stunning. I've never seen you with lippy on before. You look just like Joan Crawford in 'Mildred Pierce'. Who do I look like? Who do I look like? - I'll get back to you. - (CHUCKLES) - You girls up for anything? - No. What about you? Best shop window. Again. (CHUCKLES) Ooh! Excuse me! Hi, over here. Ooh, what have you got? Ooh, I'm starving. Oh, mini goats' cheese pizzas? I'm so over those. Me too! No, thanks anyway. (GASPS) Oh, my god, Trude. Don't look now, don't look now, but over there is '80s perm! - (SQUEALING) Oh, no! - Oh! She's dressed to the max! - Oh, it's too funny! - What's she got on? (SQUEALS AND LAUGHS) I can't believe it. Oh, my god. I didn't know she was with Kel's Meats! My giddy gaydar. The one with the man bag? - BOTH: Mmm. - Poof if ever I saw one. Oh, don't! You're dreadful, you're dreadful. Is that included in the meal, Kel? I'd say so. Oh... Gee, I feel a bit overdressed, actually. Kath, no-one holds a candle to you, sweets. Well, they better not. This has got a High Fire Danger label on it. Oh! Oh, look. This is the new thing, Kel. Goats' cheese. Thank you, Si-o-ba-han. (FUNKY MUSIC) (DOG BARKS) COMMENTATOR: Great goal by Farren Ray. - High-fives all around... - (DOOR SLAMS) ..for the Bulldogs, and the Bulldogs have gone... (ANNOYED SIGH) What's wrong? What's the matter, Kimmy? - I just got wind. - Oh. Me too. No, I just got wind that Mona is having a party for whiny Briony on the same day at the same time as Epponnee's. - Oh, really, Kim? - (SIGHS) I just bumped into one of the creche mums at 7-Eleven, and get this. Mona is getting a petting zoo for whiny Briony and jet ski rides for all the mum and dads. - Oh, she's such a biatch! - I like Mona. (SIGHS) Not Mona. Whiny Briony! So manipulative. She just gets whatever she wants. (PHONE RINGS) Sounds familiar. Hello? Yes. Oh, well, get stuffed, then. (SIGHS) Who was that? Bree's not coming. Her mother thinks it's inappropriate for a one-year-old to have a celebrity party, and she doesn't even know who Mischa Barton is. I mean, does the woman not read? (SIGHS) It's gonna be a bloody disaster! What other celebrities have you already got coming, Kimmy? Well, we've got Nicole Richie, Natalie Bassingthwaighte, Bono and Bob Geldof. Well, they're all fun. Sounds like quite a good crowd. 'Quite good' is crap, Brett. If Epponnee's party doesn't blow everyone out of the water, she's gonna grow up like me. With no self-esteem! - Poor Kimmy. - (SIGHS) Can't you just change the date? No way. We're gonna fight this. And win. Sharon, get balloon blowing. Now! Do I have to come as Felicity Huffman? Cyn, Mona, Mon, Crystal, all you kids at The Peel - you're beautiful. - Congratulations. No, I haven't finished yet, actually. And to all the naysayers who said that an apricot waistcoat would not fly out the door. Boring! And finally, Barbra, my schnoodle. I love you. Daddy will be home soon, darling. And of course my mum, Rhonda, who's watching at home in Broken Hill. Well, it's not actually televised, Daryl. It's not? Well, it bloody well should be. No argument from me. Thank you. No. I love you all! (APPLAUSE) Thank you. Lovely sentiment. Well done, Daryl. Now it's time for the biggie. And the nominees for the Fountain Gate Retailer of the Year are... Petra Hair Care, who I have to say have been supplying me with outstanding shampoos, conditioners and styling gels for over 15 years. Thank you. (ONLY KATH AND KEL CLAPPING) The Tie Rack up on the mezzanine, last year's winner. Could it be back-to-back? Coochie Coo Kids Wear. First-time nominee. Honour in itself. Well done. And finally, a familiar face, Kel Knight, Purveyor of Fine Meats. (SOMEONE COUGHS) And the award goes to... Worthy winner. Kel Knight. Kel Knight, Purveyor of Fine Meats. (APPLAUSE) - Kel Knight, ladies and gentlemen. - Well done, Kel. - MAN 1: Good on you, Kel! - MAN 2: Go, Kel! You beauty! - Thank you so much. - WOMAN: I love you, Kel! Well done, Kel. We're a little pushed for time, so... OK, thanks. Oh... This is surreal. Unbelievable. I've been dreaming of this. Fountain Gate Retailer of the Year. Whoo! Oh, can't believe it. Thanks so much. - Thanks. Ni-night. Thanks very much. - Good on you, Kel. Thank you. - Well done. - Oh, and Kath, this one's for you. - You are the wings beneath my wind. - Thanks very much. Lovely words. Well done. Kel Knight, everybody. (APPLAUSE AND WHISTLING) Thank you, Kel. Little pushed for time right now. OK, folks. That's it. Congratulations to all winners tonight. Absolutely tremendous. Little bit of housekeeping before we go. I've spoken to the car park, they will stay open for another half an hour. Enjoy your coffee. (FUNKY MUSIC) Come on, Sharon. Help me with these goodie bags. OK. Right. Each bag contains... one Garnier Fructis firming booster sample sachet. One 'TV Week'. One Napoleon Perdis bee-sting lip shine. Oh, where did you get that? Don't ask. And stop eating the Ferrero Rochers! Hello? Oh, yes, thanks for calling back. Yes, I was just enquiring about hiring a celebrity lookalike. Oh, yes. Oh! Hello, doll. You're home early. Well, if Retailer of the Year can't come home and sit on his laurels with his wife for five minutes, what can he do? Oh! (CHUCKLES) And have a look at this. Oh, wow! We're on the cover of the 'Gate'! - Oh, look at me. I look 100. - No, you don't! You look nice. - You look great. - Yeah, I do. And we got three more invitations to opening nights. Oh. Oh! Chris and Marie's bare-rooted roses sale opening! - Oh, gee, Kel. It's all starting. - It is. I'm so there, Jackie O. Right, so no Lindsay Lohans left? Well, who have you got? Two Lara Bingles and a Ralph Fiennes? No, I'll get back to you. Right. (FUNKY MUSIC) Who would you like me to make it out to? - Phyllis. - To Phyllis. These are my chicken and leek. I hope you enjoy them. Lovely. Have a lovely night. Thanks very much. (FUNKY MUSIC) DARYL: Can I help you? Oh. Hello, you. Congratulations. I think mine's a little bit bigger. - Story of my life. - Yeah... What can I do you for? Oh, I've got all these openings. I think I need a new tuxedo. - Have a look. - Oh, terrific. By the way, are you interested in coming along to one of our regular little gatherings? It's a sort of an alternative retailers' association. Just us boys. It's called Fruits 'n' Suits. It's a hoot. That one's 699. I was thinking you'd do a deal. You know, give it to me pro bono. Pro what? (CHUCKLES) Kel. You know, give it to me for free. You know? Good publicity, me being Retailer of the Year. I'm pretty well known around here now. Well, that may be as such, but you're not exactly Grant Denyer yet. The suit is $699. Well, I might go and see Barry on the mezzanine and see what he can do for me. Well, you just do that. So, Kim, how much is this all gonna cost? I don't know. Not much. Pony rides, jumping castle, catering. It's ridiculous. We're trying to save for our own house. Brett, do you think you could cut me some slack and just let me run with some of my ideas? Well, it's just a bit over-the-top, you know, catering it... Everyone outsources their party pies and sausage rolls these days! Alright. Kim, at least just have a budget. (SIGHS) (MOCKING) A budget! A budget! Do you think Ron Walker had a budget for the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games? By the looks, I don't think so. I've gotta go. Trust me, Brett. I know what I'm doing! (TOILET FLUSHES) What have you come as? Oh, Kel and I are going to the opening of the new Gloria Jean's on Bonbeach Station, so I'm just teaming with a theme. But Mum, I need you to look after Epponnee 'cause I've gotta go to Fountain Gate. I've got so much to do! - No, Kim, I can't! - (SIGHS) I mean, you know, now Kel's a pillar of the community, and I'm a virtual pillar myself... I mean, you know, Fountain Lakes First Lady. Tickets! Yeah, well, 'tickets' is the operative word, Kim. I mean, if Kel and I aren't at every local opening, we make or break shows. I mean, we're bums on seats - literally. Gee, no big names here, Kel. What are you talking about? You're looking at him. Uh, sorry, this is a VIP section. Oh, no, Kel, it's Eric Bana. - Oh! - Hello, Eric. - G'day. - I'm Kath. Kath Day-Knight. - OK. - This is my husband, Kel. Yeah, I think he knows who I am. Yeah. When did we last catch up? I think it was in Munich. - What do you do, Kel? - Yeah. (CHUCKLES) Don't be funny. Uh, another skinny latte, thanks! - Make it a double. - Yep. Oh, Kel, don't you think you've had enough? That's your third double espresso. - I'm fine. - You're wired. Hey, can you get your cameras out of my face? - Sorry, I'm just trying... - That's alright. - That's what we're here for. - Hey, look, seriously. No more photos, please. Kel! No, Kel! Just back it off! Sorry, Eric. (CHUCKLES) So, how long are you back here in Australia for this time? - Oh, I actually live here. - Oh, that's right. - Yes, I read that in the magazines. - Yeah... And yourself? Obviously an actress, being such a looker. Oh! Thank you, Eric. Yes, I am. I've actually just finished a run of 'Hedda Gabler' at the Fountain Lakes Players. Oh, really? Who did you play? The gobbler? Yes, I did, actually. Sorry, Eric, can I just get a quick photo of you there? - Yeah, sure, mate. - Oh. - Me too? - Jump in. Oh! Eric Bana. (CAMERA CLICKS) Hey! Back off, mate. You're getting a bit too close to my wife. - Kel! What's wrong? - Don't poke me, mate OK? No. Put your manners back in your pocket, or this interview is over. - Kel... - OK, mate... - What are you doing? - Hey! Don't walk away from me, you little turd! What? Kel! Kel, stop it! No! Kel! Stop it! Kel! He's the Incredible Hulk! - Oh, god! - Are you finished, mate? (SCREAMING) Kel! Stop it! Eric, watch out! Oh, stop it! Leave him alone! Look out, Eric! Where's your wife? Oh, he's going green! Oh! (TYRES SKID) (STATIC) (MUFFLED SPEECH) (MUFFLED SPEECH AND STATIC BUZZ) Mrs D, I've got the latest copy of the 'Gate'. You and Kel are all over it. Oh, don't, Sharon. Kel lost it last night. Took on Eric Bana. And you can imagine who came off worse. - Eric's still in hospital. - KIM: Mum! Have you worked out your costume for the party today? I mean, do you even know which celebrity you're coming as? Yes, I'm coming as Kate Moss, because I look like her. And Kel's coming as her boyfriend, Peter O'Doherty, which fits, because he's out of control. Oh, god, is that the time? 9:30? Kel's still in bed. Kel! Has Kel given up work, Mrs D? (SIGHS) No. But the fame has gone to his head. I tell you, Sharon, he's living the rock-and-roll lifestyle. Getting up at 9:30, going to bed well after 10:00. (CRASHING, GLASS SHATTERS) Oh, no! What's that? Oh, no! Now he's throwing televisions out the window! Sorry. I was trying to get reception. (SIGHS) Kel, I think you better pop in the shower and go to work, toot sweet, please. (TV ZAPPING) Oh, don't touch it, Sharon. It's still smoking. KIM: Right. This is the VIP section. Wow! What will we do in there? No, you won't be allowed in there, Sharon. (FUNKY MUSIC (SIGHS) Hi, Kel. Ah. Hi, Kath. You're my first customer all day. (CHUCKLES) - Oh. Really? - Yeah... Oh, where have all your gourmet sausages gone? Yeah, I didn't get time to make any. Oh. That's a shame. Well, look, I'm just here to pick up the little boys for Epp's party. Oh, Epps's party! Oh, sweets, I don't think I can close the shop early again today. - Oh... - (SIGHS) I think you are right, Kath. I have taken my eye off the ball a bit, and business is starting to suffer. Yeah. Well, I think you have been a bit seduced, Kel. You know, by your newfound celebrity, albeit C-list. I've seen it happen before. Creative people, they get their pictures in the magazines too much and they stop trying with their work. Yeah. And ultimately what they start creating becomes banal. Well, that's not gonna happen to me. I'm staying here till 5:30. Oh, well, good boy. And I'm coming up with ideas for five new sausages. Oh! How does veal and Vietnamese mince sound? Oh, that sounds delish, doll. Alright, well, if you're gonna do that, I better rethink my Kate Moss cossie, because, you know, I don't want to have flat hair all night! (CHUCKLES) No way. I'll get rid of this for a start. (FUNKY MUSIC) That is a massive Hummer. (KNOCKING) Sorry! Felicity! Felicity! Nice move. Thanks, Felicity. Thanks very much. Again, Felicity, thank you. It's me. It's really me, Sharon. Yeah. Yes. Felicity... - Oh. Oh! Mrs D, that's great. - Who are you? Oh, Brett! I'm Nicole in her early years. You know, 1989 Logies frock? Yeah, Nicole, Nicole, how do you feel about TomKat? Oh. No comment, Brett. Nicole, where's Keith? Where's Keith? No comment. Ooh, Posh! Posh! I'm not Posh, I'm Bec Hewitt! And Epponnee's Mia Hewitt. Anyway, it doesn't matter, the party's all over. Everyone's going to Mona's. (EXHALES) After all my efforts. Oh, don't worry, Kim. Look at little Epps. She's loving the red carpet! 1,000 bucks down the drain. 1,000 bucks? Are you kidding, Kim? Shut up, Brett! I hate you! Kim... Posh! Posh! I'm not Posh! Have you been sick, Kel? You could say that, Mrs Somers. - OK. Ta-ta. - Bye. G'day, Daryl. What can I do you for? Yes, I'm up for some pro bonos. I'm sure we can work something out. Just small ones, actually. They're for Barbra, my schnoodle. No worries. As many as you like. You alright, Kel? You seem a little bit stressed. I'm meant to be at a celebrity party, but no costume. Oh! I can help you there. Just pop down to the shop after you close. Did you say celebrity? (CHUCKLES) Kel, you should just go as yourself. No way. I'm just Kel. Plain old Kel. Purveyor of damn fine meats. OK. Who's next? BRETT: That's lovely, Felicity. That's great. Sign a little higher. Turn to me. Shoulder, thanks. That's great. That's... Hold that. Great, yeah, thanks. Thanks, Felicity. Felicity, get out of the VIP section, now! Oh, Kim! Why can't I be a very important person? (DOG BARKS) I think someone's here. Who is it? I don't know. It looks like... (GASPS) Oh, my god! It is! - Mrs D! - Yeah? It's Keith Urban. It really is Keith Urban. (MUTTERS) Jeez... (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC) ♪ I'm a bad boy ♪ A bad boy for love... ♪ Keith! I mean, Kel. You look gorgeous! Oh, the hair, the chaps, the Cuban heels... - Come here, Nicole. - Oh... Kel, the pull of fame too strong for you? Oh, I love a red carpet opportunity. Oh, ditto, twofold, you great hunk of spunk. I'd go to the opening of a fridge if someone invited me. (CHUCKLES) - Keith? Nicole? - (GASPS) That's enough, Brett. Respect our privacy, please. ♪ Yeah, I'm a bad boy ♪ A bad boy for love... ♪ (SIGHS) Oh, well, that was good in the end. What are you reading? 'Spotless'. You know, it's all about stain removal. It was really sad. Speaking of stains, Sharon spilt Gatorade on my skinny legs. Oh, actually, that's in here. Let me look. Hang on, where did I see that? Yes, here it is. Uh, Gatorade on skinny legs - "Make a paste -" "two parts bicarb," "one part pneumonia." "Leave o'night." Well, I'm reading 'The Secret'. Oh, yeah. What's that about? Well, it's just about if you want something, you can wish for it, and you'll get it, 100%. I didn't know that. (EPPONNEE GURGLES ON MONITOR) Go to sleep, Epponnee, please. (WHINING) Poor little Epps. You know, you and Brett should think about having another baby, Kim. Well, actually, we've been trying. - Really? - Yep. Nothing's happening, though. Oh... Well, maybe you should think about getting into some futility treatment. What's the point? Although, I wouldn't mind having a designer baby. You know those ones you can choose from a catalogue? Oh, yes! Where you can just, like, choose your genes. You can choose a professor's genes and mix it with a model's genes. That's right. But I suppose the risk is it might look like the professor and think like the model. Yeah, that's a risk. No, it'd be good, it'd be good. And you could carry it for me. You could be my surrogate. And then I'd have no downtime. - That'd be good. - No way, Jose! I'm not going there again, god... Why don't you just do what it says in 'The Secret' and wish for a baby? Yeah, that's a good idea, actually! Does it say how long it takes before it arrives? Yep. Hold on. It does, it does. Just here. Yep. Three working days. - Really? That's quicker than eBay! - Yeah! Gee, I might wish for something. What can I wish for? Oh, I know what I need! A new video iPod. Because my Nano's far too small to hold all Anthony Callea's huge back catalogue. Captioned by Ai-Media ai-media. tv - Oh, it's nice. - It's nice. - It's different. It is nice. - Yeah, it's unusual.
