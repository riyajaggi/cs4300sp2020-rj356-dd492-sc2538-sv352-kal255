I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN HIM, BUT YOU NEVER KNEW WHO HE WAS. YOU'VE CHEERED FOR HIM AND CRIED FOR HIM, WOMEN HAVE WANTED TO DIE FOR HIM. BUT DID HE EVER GET ANY CREDIT? OR THE GIRL? NO. HE WAS WHAT WE CALL A STUNTMAN. AND THE REASON I'M TALKIN' SO FONDLY ABOUT HIM IS... WELL, BECAUSE IT'S ME, COLT SEAVERS. ANYWAY, PICTURE WORK ISN'T WALL-TO-WALL EMPLOYMENT. SO MAYBE YOU WONDER HOW A GUY KEEPS HIS HEAD TOGETHER. WELL, ONE WAY IS TO WAIT BY THE PHONE... AND WAIT... AND WAIT. THE OTHER IS TO TAKE AN OCCASIONAL JOB FOR THE COURT SYSTEM... OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHERE A MAN IS CONSIDERED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE... GET OUT OF JAIL ON WHAT WE CALL BAIL. AND THEY RUN LIKE HELL. THAT'S WHERE I COME IN. I SOMETIMES PICK UP RENT MONEY TRYIN' TO FIND THEM... AND BRING THEM BACK TO JUSTICE. BUT RIGHT NOW I'M DOIN' A PICTURE THAT'S FULL OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES, AND THAT CAN BE REAL DANGEROUS, SO YOU HAVE TO REHEARSE IT VERY CAREFULLY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOIN' AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT. REHEARSAL, EVERYBODY! REHEARSAL! WE'LL DO A DRY RUN AT SLOW SPEED. [Director] OKAY, BANDITOS, COME OUT SHOOTING! [Director] OKAY, GO WITH THE DYNAMITE! THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL GET OFF, KID. HE'LL THROW THE DYNAMITE AT THAT POINT. SEE, THE CHARGES ARE BURIED IN FRONT OF THE SALOON. WHEN HE THROWS THE PHONY DYNAMITE, I SET OFF A SIGNAL. KABANG! YOU GOT IT. WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! THAT'S A PERFECT DRY RUN, COLT. - READY TO DO IT FOR KEEPS? - READY AS I'LL EVER BE. OKAY. [Colt] GIDDAP. EVERYTHING ALL SET? YEP. IT'S TIMED TO BLOW TWO SECONDS AFTER YOU PASS. SO THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU ABOUT 10 FEET OF LEEWAY. - BE CAREFUL, YOU GUYS. - LET'S DO IT. GIDDAP. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, THIS IS GONNA BE THE REAL THING NOW. TOM, ARE YOU SURE THOSE EXPLOSIVES ARE REALLY SAFE? THOSE GUYS WILL COME OUT WITHOUT EVEN A SCRATCH. YOU SEE, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIMING. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, ROLL 'EM. ACTION! ♪♪ [Rock Playing On Radio] - WHERE IN THE HELL DID HE COME FROM? - [Jody] THE CHARGES! HE DOESN'T KNOW THEY'RE RADIO-CONTROLLED! [Jody] OH, MY GOD! COLT! [Screams] [Horse Whinnying] [Groans] [Man] SOMEBODY GET THE HORSES, QUICK! GET A DOCTOR! COLT, I WONDER WHAT SET THOSE CHARGES OFF EARLY. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION... A VERY GOOD QUESTION. COLT, THAT WAS THE BEST STUNT I EVER SEEN YOU DO. THANKS. JACK, YOU GOTTA SEE IT. THEY GAVE US A WHOLE TOWN TO BLOW UP. - COLT, IS HE SERIOUS? - YEAH, BLANCA ROBLES. IT'S A '40s BOOMTOWN. DIDN'T EVEN GO POP. IT'S OUT IN THE DESERT NEAR THE GRAPEVINE. SEE, THE STATE WAS GONNA DEMOLISH IT ANYWAY, SO THE STUDIO SAVES THE STATE THE WORK, AND THE STATE SAVES THE STUDIO SOME MONEY. I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAN'T GET A DEAL LIKE THAT. IF I WAITED FOR THE STATE MARSHALS... TO BRING BACK MY BAIL JUMPERS, I'D BE OUTTA WORK IN SIX MONTHS. PLUS, YOU'D HAVE BEEN MISSING OUT ON THE GREATEST CHILI DOGS IN TOWN. COLT, THEY'RE GOOD, BUT I... I MEAN, I WOULDN'T GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THEY'RE THE GREATEST. HEY, EVERYBODY COMES HERE. - HI, COLT. - SEE? - YOU STILL RISKING YOUR LIFE? - ONLY FOR YOU. HEY, TONY, TWO CHILI HOT DOGS TO GO. EASY ON THE CHILI. [Big Jack] ANYWAY, COLT, YOU GET THIS GUY BACK FOR ME, AND THERE IS A 20% REWARD IN IT FOR YOU. THAT'S ABOUT, UH, 2,500 CHILI DOGS. HIS NAME IS RANDY SOAMES.

WELL, UH, HIS LAWYER SAYS HE'S KIND OF AN OUTGOING GUY WHO LIKES TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. WELL, THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS SHY AWAY FROM PARTIES GIVEN BY LAWYERS. ANYWAY, YOU GOT ANY IDEA WHERE WE CAN FIND THIS MR., UH, SOAMES? [Big Jack] HIS ADDRESS IS RIGHT THERE IN THE FILE. - HE'S IN MOJAVE. - YOU MEAN HE'S JUST SITTING THERE RIGHT AT HOME?

YOU SUPPOSE BIG JACK KNEW THAT SOAMES WAS THE LEADER OF A BIKER GANG? DOES THIS TRUCK NEED NEW SHOCKS? SHE KNEW. SHE ALSO KNEW THAT WITH A BIG STUNT JOB COMIN' UP, WE MIGHT NOT TAKE A DANGEROUS CASE. SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW? TELL HER TO GET SOMEBODY ELSE I HOPE. NO, WE TOOK THE JOB, KID. WE FINISH WHAT WE STARTED. PROVIDED I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW. NARCOTICS, GUN RUNNING, EXTORTION...

AS I RECALL, THE ORGANIZATION OF THIS GANG IS FAIRLY LOOSE. THE TROUBLE IS THEIR FRIENDSHIP SEEMS PRETTY TIGHT. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THOSE GANG MEMBERS STICK TOGETHER. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A HELL OF A TIME GETTING YOUR MAN. SOUNDS LIKE THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS CUT HIM OUT OF THE HERD. [Chuckles] YOU KNOW, MR. SEAVERS, YOU WON'T BE THE FIRST TO TRY. YOU KNOW, IF I COULD LOOK AT WHAT THE OTHERS HAD TO SAY... I'M AFRAID NOT. THIS INFORMATION'S STRICTLY FOR BUREAU USE. UH, MR. GRAHAM, EXCUSE ME, BUT DIDN'T I JUST HEAR YOU SAY YOU'D HELP? AND WE WILL. WE'LL DO WHAT WE NEED TO, MR. SEAVERS, WHEN WE NEED TO. DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR? YEAH, BUT WHAT'S UNCLEAR IS WHY YOU'RE LETTIN' SOAMES RUN FREE. LOOK, I DON'T WANNA STEP ON ANY F.B.I. TOES, BUT I'M TRYIN' TO BRING BACK A FUGITIVE. AS LONG AS YOU DO INDEED WATCH YOUR STEP. [Motorcycle Revving] COLT. WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM. COLT! WHERE ARE YOU, COLT? COLT! COLT, THEY'RE AFTER US! COLT!

JUST BEFORE HE BROKE UP AN OPERATION IT TOOK US MONTHS TO SET UP. AND YOU THINK COLT SEAVERS DELIBERATELY FOULED UP YOUR OPERATION. NO, NO, NO. WE'RE NOT ACCUSING ANYBODY OF ANYTHING, MS. JACK. BUT THE FACT REMAINS SEAVERS DID COME INTO THE BUREAU ASKING SOME VERY SUSPICIOUS QUESTIONS. AND NOW HE'S RUNNING WITH THE SOAMES GANG. YOU LISTEN TO ME. COLT'S NOT RUNNING WITH ANYONE. HE'S WORKING FOR ME, TRYING TO BRING RANDY SOAMES TO JUSTICE. WHICH, I MIGHT ADD, IS SOMETHING MORE THAN YOU PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. MS. JACK, WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO BRING TO JUSTICE IS THE WHOLE GANG. WE WERE GATHERING EVIDENCE TO DO IT WHEN YOUR FRIEND INTERFERED. WE HAD NO IDEA SEAVERS COULD PENETRATE THE GANG. AND THE NEXT TIME WE RUN INTO MR. SEAVERS ON THIS CASE, WE WON'T LET HIM GET IN OUR WAY. GENTLEMEN, I KNOW YOUR OPERATIONS. YOU CAN WORK THREE YEARS ON A CASE, AND THEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS. BELIEVE ME, MS. JACK, THAT'S NOT THE CASE HERE... NOT WITH THE INFORMANT WE'VE GOT IN THE GANG. AN INFORMANT WHOSE VERY LIFE MIGHT BE IN DANGER RIGHT NOW... AND NOTHING AT ALL WE CAN DO TO HELP. WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO? YES, THAT WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE ON OUR PART. I ASSURE YOU, IF COLT SEAVERS KNEW YOU ALREADY HAD SOMEBODY THERE, HE'D NEVER ENDANGER HIM.
