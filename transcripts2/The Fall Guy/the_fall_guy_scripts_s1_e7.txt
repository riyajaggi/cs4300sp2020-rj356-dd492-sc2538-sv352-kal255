SO MAYBE YOU WONDER HOW A GUY KEEPS HIS HEAD TOGETHER. WELL, ONE WAY IS TO WAIT BY THE PHONE... AND WAIT... AND WAIT. THE OTHER IS TO TAKE AN OCCASIONAL JOB FOR THE COURT SYSTEM... OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHERE A MAN IS CONSIDERED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE... GET OUT OF JAIL ON WHAT WE CALL BAIL. AND THEY RUN LIKE HELL. THAT'S WHERE I COME IN. I SOMETIMES PICK UP RENT MONEY TRYIN' TO FIND THEM... AND BRING THEM BACK TO JUSTICE. TODAY I'VE GOTTA GO TO THE STUDIO TO TEACH HOWIE MARTIAL ARTS. IT CAN COME IN REAL HANDY. [Man] OKAY. READY, ACTION! [Narrator Imitating Bogart] SHE WAS STARING AT ME FROM ACROSS THE ROOM. I COULD TELL FROM THE GLEAM IN HER EYE THAT SHE WAS HUNGRY.

YEP. - I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA TEACH ME, COLT. - HEY, KID, I'M GETTIN' TOO OLD, TOO LAZY AND TOO TIRED TO TEACH YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW.

I JUST WANT TO START OFF WITH A SIMPLE, BASIC PRINCIPLE OF DISTANCING, JUST TO SEE IF WE'VE KINDA COME FROM THE SAME SCHOOL, OKAY? I WENT TO ALL THE SCHOOLS, SO THAT'S NO PROBLEM. OKAY. WE HAVE THREE SEPARATE DISTANCES. NOW, NOTICE, FROM THIS DISTANCE THAT BASICALLY ALL I CAN DO IS MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE... JUDO THROWS, JUJITSU ARM LOCKS, CHOKE HOLDS... THINGS LIKE INSIDE GRAPPLING. THEN, NEXT WE HAVE THE OUTSIDE DISTANCE LINE. FROM HERE BASICALLY ALL I CAN DO IS, MAYBE... HEY. [Chuckles] STUFF LIKE THAT. - GOT IT? - [Howie] FUNDAMENTAL.

[Speaking Japanese] YOU MAY CALL ME OH-SAN... "MR. OH." YOU ARE SEEKING THE RIO BROTHERS FOR BAIL JUMPING IN LOS ANGELES. WELL, WORD GETS AROUND PRETTY FAST HERE. I AM JAPANESE. MY COUNTRY MANUFACTURES THE FINEST INFORMATION COMPUTERS IN THE WORLD. - WHAT DO YOU HAVE ABOUT ME IN YOUR COMPUTERS? - YOU DO NOT EXIST. - DO YOU KNOW THE MEANING OF "YAKUZA," SEAVERS-SAN? - NOT EXACTLY. WE LIVE BY A VERY STRICT CODE OF HONOR, HANDED DOWN FROM THE ORIGINAL SAMURAI WARRIORS. DOES THAT INCLUDE GROWING ILLEGAL DRUGS? MY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT THE INTEREST OF MY YAKUZA CLAN. IT IS NOT FOR ME TO QUESTION ITS ACTIVITIES. HOW DO THE RIOS FIT IN TO ALL THIS? SEVERAL BAGS OF OUR... AGRICULTURAL CROPS WERE STOLEN BY THE TWO BROTHERS. THE BAGS MUST BE RETURNED. YOU SEEM LIKE A PRACTICAL MAN, MR. OH. IF YOU WERE THE RIOS, WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THIS... AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. I WOULD SELL THEM... WHICH IS WHAT I IMAGINE THESE TWO MEN INTEND TO DO. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? WHEN YOU FIND THE RIO BROTHERS, YOU MUST BRING THEM TO ME. - I CAN'T DO THAT. - I DO NOT EXPECT YOU TO WORK FOR NOTHING. - YOU WILL BE WELL PAID. - [Whistles] WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF I GIVE 'EM TO YOU? THEY WILL BE DEALT WITH ACCORDING TO OUR LAWS. WELL, I'M SORRY. I... I HAVE MY OWN SENSE OF HONOR TO LIVE UP TO. I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT YOU RECONSIDER. CAN WE GO NOW? PERHAPS I CAN OFFER YOU ONE MORE TEMPTATION. [Speaks Japanese] - JODY. - THEY GOT ME WHEN I LANDED THE HELICOPTER. I'M SORRY. I REGRET THAT WE HAVE TO DO BUSINESS THIS WAY, SEAVERS-SAN, BUT I'M AFRAID THE LADY WILL HAVE TO STAY WITH US UNTIL THE RIO BROTHERS ARE RETURNED. IS THAT WHAT YOUR SAMURAI RELATIVES WOULD'VE DONE, OH-SAN? A WARRIOR MUST DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO WIN. THE LADY WILL BE QUITE SAFE. YOU HAVE MY WORD. YEAH, WELL, I HOPE YOUR WORD IS BETTER THAN YOUR DAMN CODE. IF WE MEET AGAIN ONE DAY, WE WILL HAVE A LONG TALK ABOUT HONOR. YEAH, YOU BET. I'LL BE BACK, JODY.

UM, WE HAVE A DEAL. YOU'LL BRING JODY, RIGHT? I LIVE BY MY WORD. WE'LL BE THERE. [Clicks, Dial Tone] COLT, YOU'RE NOT REALLY GONNA TRADE THE RIO BROTHERS FOR JODY, ARE YOU? THAT GUY'LL KILL THEM. WELL, THE RIO BROTHERS SOLD THAT DOPE FOR A LOT OF MONEY. I'M SURE OH-SAN WOULD RATHER HAVE THE CASH. WHAT IF THEY DON'T LET JODY GO?

WHY HAVEN'T YOU CALLED ME? - I AM CALLING. THIS IS ME. - I KNOW IT'S YOU. - WHERE ARE THE RIO BROTHERS? - THAT'S ALL YOU CARE ABOUT, ISN'T IT? YOU DON'T CARE IF I'M HURT, CRIPPLED OR WOUNDED. - COLT, ARE YOU HURT? - NO. THEN WHY DID YOU SAY THAT? YOU HAD ME SCARED TO DEATH. REALLY? - YOU MEN ARE SUCH BABIES. - I LIKE IT WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY. THEN YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THE REST OF THIS CONVERSATION. GET TO THE POINT. DO YOU HAVE THE RIO BROTHERS IN CUSTODY OR NOT? YES. TERRIFIC. OH, YOU'RE SUCH A DOLL, COLT. - BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM. - I KNEW IT. YOU ONLY HAVE ONE OF THEM. NO. I'VE GOT BOTH OF THEM. THEY'RE STASHED AWAY AT DON HO'S NIGHTCLUB. - THEY COULDN'T BE SAFER. - TERRIFIC. THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? - WELL, JODY'S BEEN KIDNAPPED. - JODY? WHAT'S SHE DOING THERE? A LONG STORY. THE POINT IS, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HER WANT ME TO GIVE UP THE RIO BROTHERS. COLT, HOW DO YOU GET YOURSELF INTO MESSES LIKE THIS? I DON'T KNOW. BUT I THINK I HAVE A WAY OUT. I'M GONNA LET 'EM THINK THAT I'M GONNA GIVE UP THE RIO BROTHERS, THEN I'M GONNA PULL THE OLD BAIT AND SWITCH. COLT, LOOK. IF IT GETS RIGHT DOWN TO IT, LET 'EM GO. I KNEW YOU'D SAY THAT, BUT DON'T WORRY. MY PLAN IS FOOLPROOF. TRUST ME. [Ho] OH, NO! MY COMPUTER... AND MY STAGE CHAIRS. THESE ARE MY BEST STAGE CHAIRS TOO. THEY LEFT US A NOTE, COLT. LISTEN TO THIS: "OUR MAMAS DIDN'T RAISE NO BORN MORONS. YOU AIN'T GIVIN' OUR HARD-EARNED MONEY TO THEM LITTLE CROOKS." I COULD SHOOT THOSE GUYS MYSELF. NOW WE HAVEN'T GOT THE RIOS, AND WE HAVEN'T GOT THE MONEY. SO NOW WHAT DO WE DO? WELL, EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU SET UP A STUNT. AT THE LAST MINUTE THE DIRECTOR WANTS SOMETHIN' COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, SO YOU GOTTA THINK FAST AND PRAY A LOT. SO? SO, START PRAYIN'. I SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE IN THIS GARDEN. IT IS THE ONE PLACE IN MY LIFE THAT I FIND TRUE PEACE. WELL, I WISH I COULD SHARE YOUR ENTHUSIASM. PERSONALLY, I'D RATHER BE HOME IN A HOT TUB. PLEASE FORGIVE ME, JODY-SAN, BUT KEEPING YOU PRISONER IS A NECESSARY EVIL I MUST DO. MMM, DOMO. IT'S VERY GOOD. MY UNCLE WAS A MASTER IN A TEA CEREMONY. MY PRACTICE IS PRIMITIVE, BUT THE TEA IS TASTY. HOW COULD A MAN LIKE YOU BE INVOLVED WITH GANGSTERS? MY FATHER WAS YAKUZA. HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM WAS YAKUZA. I HAVE INHERITED THIS CURSE. IN JAPANESE EYES, I COULD NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT YAKUZA. [Whispering In Japanese] BRING THEM HERE. YOUR FRIENDS HAVE COME. JODY-SAN, PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR DETAINING YOU AGAINST YOUR WILL. [Footsteps Approaching] JODY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? HAVE SOME TEA? YOU ARE ALONE. THE RIOS WERE STAYING AT A HOUSE OF A FRIEND OF MINE. - THEY... THEY ESCAPED. - I'M VERY SORRY TO HEAR THAT. IF YOU LET JODY GO, THOUGH, I PROMISE TO TRACK 'EM DOWN AND SEND YOU THE MONEY. I BELIEVE YOU WOULD DO THAT, SEAVERS-SAN. BUT I'M AFRAID I MUST KEEP THE GIRL. [Sighs] YOU'RE A MAN OF HONOR, MR. OH-SAN. SO AM I. IN THE EARLY DAYS, UH, IN MY COUNTRY, MEN SETTLED ISSUES OF HONOR MAN-TO-MAN. YOU ARE SPEAKING OF A DUEL. WELL, YOUR MEN ALL CARRY SWORDS. I, UH, ASSUME YOU KNOW HOW TO USE ONE. I'M A MASTER AT KENDO. I LEARNED THE USE OF THE SWORD FROM THE TIME I WAS ABLE TO WALK. NO ONE IN JAPAN IS MY EQUAL. WELL, I'VE USED ALL KINDS OF WEAPONS IN MY WORK, BUT I... I CAN'T SAY THAT I'M AN EXPERT WITH A SWORD, UH... MAYBE I COULD CHOOSE MY OWN WEAPON. SUCH AS THE ONE IN YOUR BELT. OH, NO. THIS IS... THIS IS, UH, LOADED WITH BLANKS. IN THE MOVIE BUSINESS WE CALL IT A PROP. YOU HAVE COME HERE UNARMED TO CHALLENGE ME TO A DUEL. NO, I BROUGHT THIS. A GOOD STUNTMAN HAS TO RELY ON HIS CONCENTRATION... AND HIS OWN WITS. YOU ARE INDEED A MAN OF COURAGE AND HONOR, SEAVERS-SAN. WE WILL DUEL, BUT YOU MUST USE A WEAPON. [Japanese] SEAVERS-SAN. [Japanese] [Japanese] I WILL ONLY HOPE THAT I DON'T KILL YOU, SEAVERS-SAN.
