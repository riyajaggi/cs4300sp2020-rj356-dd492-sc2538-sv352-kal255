I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN HIM, BUT YOU NEVER KNEW WHO HE WAS. YOU'VE CHEERED FOR HIM AND CRIED FOR HIM, WOMEN HAVE WANTED TO DIE FOR HIM. BUT DID HE EVER GET ANY CREDIT? OR THE GIRL? NO. HE WAS WHAT WE CALL A STUNTMAN. AND THE REASON I'M TALKIN' SO FONDLY ABOUT HIM IS... WELL, BECAUSE IT'S ME, COLT SEAVERS. ANYWAY, PICTURE WORK ISN'T WALL-TO-WALL EMPLOYMENT. SO MAYBE YOU WONDER HOW A GUY KEEPS HIS HEAD TOGETHER. WELL, ONE WAY IS TO WAIT BY THE PHONE... AND WAIT... AND WAIT. THE OTHER IS TO TAKE AN OCCASIONAL JOB FOR THE COURT SYSTEM... OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHERE A MAN IS CONSIDERED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE... GET OUT OF JAIL ON WHAT WE CALL BAIL. AND THEY RUN LIKE HELL. THAT'S WHERE I COME IN. I SOMETIMES PICK UP RENT MONEY TRYIN' TO FIND THEM... AND BRING THEM BACK TO JUSTICE. BUT TODAY I'M DOING WHAT I REALLY LIKE TO DO... GETTING YANKED OFF A MOTORCYCLE AT 60 MILES PER HOUR. HAS COLT EVER DONE ANYTHING THAT'S SAFE? [Man] HOW DANGEROUS IS THIS STUNT, COLT? OH, NOT BAD, AS LONG AS THE CABLE HOLDS TIGHT. [Man] AND IF IT DOESN'T? WELL, THEN MY HEAD'S GONNA BOUNCE OFF THE PAVEMENT LIKE A BASKETBALL. OKAY, I THINK WE'RE READY. WHAT DO YOU SAY, LET'S SHOOT IT, HUH? [Man] OKAY. ACTION! [Tires Squealing] [Man] CUT IT! THAT'S A PRINT! YEAH! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? NOT BAD, COLT. NOT BAD AT ALL. THE JERK WAS A LITTLE BIT SOFT, BUT NOTHING THAT CAN'T BE HANDLED BY AN OPTICAL. OPTICAL? WELL, A SMALL OPTICAL, REALLY. I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. ONCE THIS IS SOLD AS A FEATURE TO TELEVISION, THE AUDIENCE WILL NEVER NOTICE THE FLAWS. FLAWS? THE SMALL SCREEN. DETAILS DON'T SHOW UP. HEY, EVEN THE BEST STUNTS HAVE KINKS. YEAH, NECKS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO GET KINKS. BOY, YOU GIVE A STAR A LITTLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM AND HE... FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT A STAR, I'M A STUNTMAN. STARS GET A LOT OF MONEY. WE GET A LOT OF PAIN, WHICH I AM GOING TO TAKE CARE OF WITH A NICE WARM BATH. [Phone Rings] [Colt] GET THAT, WILL YOU, KID? TELL THEM I'M UNAVAILABLE. I'VE GOT AN ACTING PART... IN A SOAP. DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM, HOWIE! THAT CALL IS CRITICAL! JACK, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN MY BATHROOM? I'VE GOT FOUR BROTHERS, COLT. ALL BIGGER THAN YOU. THAT'S ASSUMING A LOT. AND STAY IN THERE! KID, YOU LET HER COME BACK OUT HERE AND YOU'RE FIRED! DON'T BE SELFISH, COLT. COME ON, WE NEED YOU. JODY. [Baby Crying] [Crying Continues] HEY. WHO THE... WHAT IS THIS? I'VE MADE MOVIES THAT DID LESS BUSINESS. NO. NO, DANNY, WAIT A MINUTE. I'M PLEADING WITH YOU. TRUST ME. DON'T RUN. YOU'LL GET KILLED. NO. I'M SURE... WAIT A MINUTE. DANNY, PLEASE, COME HOME. DON'T DO THIS FOOLISH THING. MARIE, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE PEOPLE. IF I GO TO JAIL, I'M A DEAD MAN. OH, NO. DANNY, GIVE ME ONE LAST CHANCE. YOU KNOW THAT MAN I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT LIVES AT THIS NUMBER? HE CAN FIND A WAY TO HELP YOU. HELP WHO? WHAT IS THIS? - DANNY, NO! - CAN'T A MAN TAKE A BATH IN PEACE? DANNY! IT'S NO USE. HE'S NOT COMING IN. HE'S PANICKED. WHO'S PANICKED? HE'LL KILL DANNY IF THEY SEND HIM TO JAIL. - IT'S BECAUSE OF ANIMAL. - WHO'S ANIMAL? [Howie] HE'S IN JAIL FOR ASSAULT. WELL, HOW CAN THEY SEND HIM TO JAIL IF HE'S ALREADY IN JAIL? NO, NO, NO. THEY'RE NOT SENDING HIM. THEY'RE SENDING DANNY, MARIE'S HUSBAND, FOR AN ARMORED CAR ROBBERY COMMITTED BY ANIMAL AND ANOTHER MAN. DANNY TESTIFIED AGAINST ANIMAL. SO IF HE WINDS UP IN JAIL WITH HIM, HE'S AS GOOD AS DEAD. NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NO. I'M GOING BACK TO THE BATH. THEY SAID YOU'D HELP. IF NOT FOR ME AND DANNY, [Baby Crying] THEN FOR OUR BABY. [Crying Continues] I SUPPOSE THE BABY'S GOING TO JAIL TOO? COLT, LET ME EXPLAIN. YOU SEE, DANNY GARDNER USED TO RUN WITH A PRETTY BAD CROWD. BUT HE'S SETTLED DOWN, AND HE HAD NO PART IN THIS ROBBERY, BUT HE WAS SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS. WELL, I BAILED HIM OUT PENDING HIS APPEAL, BUT WHEN IT WENT AGAINST HIM, HE RAN. AND I'M NOT SURE I BLAME HIM. YOU WANT ME TO BRING HIM BACK? YOU CAN'T DO THAT. SHE DOESN'T WANT ME TO BRING HIM BACK. WELL, WE HAVE ANOTHER IDEA. WE THINK ANIMAL'S PARTNER IS A MAN CALLED RED EYE. WE KNOW WHERE HE IS, AND ALL WE HAVE TO DO... IS GET ANIMAL TO LINK HIM AND THE MONEY AND DANNY WILL BE CLEARED. JACK, THAT'S AN AWFUL BIG ORDER. HOW DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO FILL THAT? COLT, WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN? UH-HUH. RIGHT HERE. [Howie] SHE'S GOT A PLAN. AND I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT. [Cooing] OH. [Howie] YOU'RE GOING INTO THE PRISON AS A PRISONER TO GET NEXT TO ANIMAL? [Colt] THAT'S THE PLAN. BIG JACK IS MAKING ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS. YOU KNOW, COLT, THAT COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS. THAT'S WHY I'M TAKING YOU IN THERE WITH ME. [Man] WELL, I HOPE THIS COLT SEAVERS KNOWS WHAT HE'S GETTING INTO. HE'S DEALT WITH CRIMINALS FOR A LONG TIME. I COULDN'T LET ANYBODY ELSE HERE KNOW HE WASN'T A REAL CON. TOO MANY LEAKS IN PRISON. THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A TIGHT COVER. I'VE SPREAD WORD HE WAS A COP KILLER. A COP KILLER? THAT'S GOING TO TURN THE GUARDS AGAINST HIM. WE HAVE 75 GUARDS AND 3,000 INMATES. WHAT SIDE DO YOU WANT HIM ON? WELL, IF YOU PUT IT THAT WAY, JIM, I GUESS I HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU. LET'S JUST HOPE IT DOESN'T TAKE COLT TOO LONG TO GET CLOSE TO THIS GUY CALLED ANIMAL. IT'S A NICE DAY. IT'S TOO HOT. MUCH TOO HOT THOUGH. I DON'T LIKE YOU. I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. NO, YOU CAN'T. 'CAUSE I REALLY DON'T LIKE YOU. [Chattering] HEY! - WHO PUSHED ME? - I DID. WHAT, ARE YOU PROTECTIN' YOUR BUDDY? NOPE. JUST PROTECTING YOU. ME? THAT GUY YOU JUST PUSHED IS CRAZY. HE'LL DO ANYTHING. [Colt] THAT GUY, HE'S TOUCHED IN THE HEAD. YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID THAT GOT HIM THROWN IN HERE? NO. WHAT? [Whispering, Indistinct] HE DID THAT? WELL, KEEP HIM AWAY FROM ME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID, BUT THANKS. DON'T THANK ME TILL YOU FIND OUT WHAT YOU DID. CRANDALL, LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. YEAH? EVER HEAR OF JAKE WILSON? THE ANIMAL. YEAH, THAT'S THE GUY. HIM AND ME ARE OLD FRIENDS. I HEARD HE WAS HERE. YEAH, HE'S HERE. - YEAH, WELL, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM. - YOU'LL FIND OUT AFTER YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS JOINT FOR A WHILE. IF YOU DON'T SEE THEM ON THE WORK DETAIL, THEY'RE IN THE HOLE. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT? YEAH. YOU HEARD ME. HOW LONG ARE THEY GONNA KEEP HIM IN THERE? HE'S BAD, MAN. I HOPE THEY KEEP HIM IN THERE FOR HIS DURATION. NO CONVERSATION. [Gun Cocks] - YOU ENJOY THAT? - COP KILLER. DID YOU FIND ANYTHING OUT, COLT? FOR SOME CRAZY REASON, NONE OF THESE GUYS WILL TALK TO ME. WELL, I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MESS HALL. WHAT? WE'VE GOT A DINNER DATE. WEAR YOUR DANCIN' SHOES, KID. YOU AND ME HAVE TO STAGE AN OLD-FASHIONED STUNTMAN'S BRAWL. HOWDY, SLOB. COOL IT! COOL IT! THE GUY'S A NUT. TAKE IT EASY. HE'S A PSYCHO. HOWIE, YOUR FIGHT IS WITH ME. TRUST ME, COLT. NOW YOU'VE DONE IT! NOW YOU'VE DONE IT. NO, HE'S MINE. [Man] BREAK IT UP! A FIGHT. TAKE IT EASY! BREAK 'EM UP! LET ME AT HIM! I'LL KILL HIM! I SWEAR! I'LL KILL HIM! WHO STARTED IT? HE DID!

WITH ANIMAL. BACK AGAINST THE WALL. WE'RE OPENING UP. ONE MORE COMING IN. HI THERE. I'M GONNA KILL YOU. - COLT SEAVERS IS MY NAME. - I DON'T LIKE ROOMMATES. THE GUARD BROKE MY SHOULDER, BUT I COULD KILL YOU WITH ONE HAND. OH, I DON'T TAKE UP MUCH ROOM. [Punch Landing] [Body Thuds] [Chuckling] [Punches Landing] [Body Thuds] [Grunting] [Panting] PEGGY, HAVE YOU REACHED DR. MASON? YES, SIR.

NOW THIS ISN'T GONNA HURT... OHH! MUCH. - HEY, WHAT'D YOU DO? - I SET THE BONE, I THINK. [Inhales, Exhales] SURE MAKES BREATHING A LOT EASIER. WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO SET BONES LIKE THAT?

IN THREE DAYS, I'LL BE SENT UP TO THE STATE PRISON, WHERE ANIMAL'S WAITING TO KILL ME. NOT IF COLT CAN HELP IT. COLT? HE'S A STUNTMAN, JACK, NOT SUPERMAN.
