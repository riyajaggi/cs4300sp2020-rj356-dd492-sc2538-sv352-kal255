I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN HIM, BUT YOU NEVER KNEW WHO HE WAS. YOU'VE CHEERED FOR HIM AND CRIED FOR HIM, WOMEN HAVE WANTED TO DIE FOR HIM. BUT DID HE EVER GET ANY CREDIT? OR THE GIRL? NO. HE WAS WHAT WE CALL A STUNTMAN. AND THE REASON I'M TALKIN' SO FONDLY ABOUT HIM IS... WELL, BECAUSE IT'S ME, COLT SEAVERS. ANYWAY, PICTURE WORK ISN'T WALL-TO-WALL EMPLOYMENT. SO MAYBE YOU WONDER HOW A GUY KEEPS HIS HEAD TOGETHER. WELL, ONE WAY IS TO WAIT BY THE PHONE... AND WAIT... AND WAIT. THE OTHER IS TO TAKE AN OCCASIONAL JOB FOR THE COURT SYSTEM... OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHERE A MAN IS CONSIDERED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE... GET OUT OF JAIL ON WHAT WE CALL BAIL. AND THEY RUN LIKE HELL. THAT'S WHERE I COME IN. I SOMETIMES PICK UP RENT MONEY TRYIN' TO FIND THEM... AND BRING THEM BACK TO JUSTICE. RIGHT NOW I'M WORKIN' ON ONE OF THOSE FAMOUS TV SHOWS THAT FEATURE STUNTMEN. YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN IT. [Engine Revving] [Engine Stops] WE'RE HERE TODAY ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, WHERE ONE OF HOLLYWOOD'S MOST DARING STUNTMEN, COLT SEAVERS, IS ABOUT TO ATTEMPT ONE OF THE MOST DEATH-DEFYING STUNTS EVER SEEN ON THIS SHOW. THEY'RE MOVING THE RAMP IN PLACE AND RAISING IT TO ITS PROPER HEIGHT, WHILE COLT IS MAKING A FINAL CHECK ON HIS EQUIPMENT. THE FILM CREWS ARE MAKING SURE THEY'LL BE READY FOR THE JUMP AS WELL. I'M SURE COLT WON'T WANT TO DO THIS JUMP AGAIN IF THEY MISS IT. THE BUSES ARE NOW MOVING INTO PLACE. EACH BUS IS OVER 40 FEET IN LENGTH, SO COLT'S JUMP WILL COVER A DISTANCE CLOSE TO 160 FEET. WHEN COLT RELEASES HIS CLUTCH AT THE CRUCIAL MOMENT, HE'LL HAVE TO HIT THE TAKEOFF RAMP AT OVER 60 MILES PER HOUR. HE'S GOING TO ATTEMPT TO JUMP HIS MOTORCYCLE... OVER THESE FOUR YELLOW BUSES PARKED END TO END... A SIGHT I KNOW YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS. SO STAY TUNED. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH A STUNT... THAT'S GONNA MAKE YOU TURN TO THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU AND SAY, "NOW, THAT'S INCREDIBLE." AND... CUT. BEAUTIFUL, CATHY LEE. GOOD. FINALLY, COLT. FINALLY, YOU'RE GETTING THE RECOGNITION YOU DESERVE. YEAH, WELL, I'LL BE GETTING THE INJURIES I DESERVE... IF I DON'T MAKE SURE EVERYTHING GOES PERFECT. HEY, YOU REMEMBER WHEN CATHY LEE SAID THAT YOU WERE THE MOST DARING STUNTMAN IN HOLLYWOOD? YEAH. I REALLY FELT PROUD. THAT'S REAL NICE, KID. I APPRECIATE THAT. SOMEDAY THEY'LL SAY THAT ABOUT ME. YEAH, WELL, HOW ABOUT TODAY? TODAY? WELL, UH... WELL, I'D LOVE TO, COLT, BUT, UH... BUT...

YOU'LL BE SAFE THERE. - JUST GET A TABLE IN THE LOUNGE AND STAY PUT TILL WE GET BACK. - WE? YEAH. YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ME TO HIS APARTMENT. COME ON. CAN WE DRIVE SLOW THIS TIME? I PROMISE. COME ON, LOU. ♪♪ [Country Instrumental] ♪♪ [Continues] I'VE HAD POISON THAT TASTES BETTER THAN THIS STUFF. WHY DON'T YOU ORDER ANOTHER BOTTLE? DON'T YOU EVER HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY ABOUT ANYTHING? - WHY SHOULD I? - THAT'S A GREAT ATTITUDE. HOW CAN YOU GO THROUGH LIFE WITH AN OUTLOOK LIKE THAT? HEY, SPARE ME THE LECTURE, WILL YA, BLONDIE? I DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO ANYBODY FOR WHO I AM. I HAD TO FIGHT AND SCRATCH FOR EVERYTHING I GOT! I WASN'T BORN WITH A SILVER SPOON IN MY MOUTH! IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP, YOU'RE GONNA GET ONE SHOVED DOWN YOUR THROAT. ♪♪ [Continues] I DON'T CARE WHAT THOSE SLOBS THINK. SAY, BUDDY, WE'RE TRYIN' TO LISTEN TO THE SHOW, HUH? - SO WHAT'S STOPPING YOU? - YOUR MOUTH. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WANNA STAY SHUT. HEY, BEER BELLY, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT? COOL IT, LOU. - I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THAT FLAK FROM THAT GORILLA. - [Jody] LOU! WOULD YOU LIKE TO STEP OUTSIDE? I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO WATCH THE SHOW. WHAT'S THE MATTER? CAN'T YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND? OH, THAT DID IT. HEY, NOW WAIT A MINUTE, GUYS. LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THIS. GET OUT OF MY WAY! GET HIM! [Lou] I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO WATCH THE SHOW! YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE, YOU BUM! YEAH, YOU SHOULD TALK. EVERY TIME YOU WALK INTO A ROOM, A FIGHT STARTS. ARE YOU BLAMING ME FOR THAT? OH, NO, NO. THAT WAS MY FAULT. WELL, HOW DID I KNOW THE GUY WAS SENSITIVE ABOUT HIS WEIGHT? THIS IS GREAT. WE CAN'T GET BACK INTO THE CASINO NOW, AND GOD KNOWS WHERE COLT IS. AND SOMEWHERE THERE'S A GANG OF HOODS OUT HERE WHO WANNA KILL YOU. I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THEY'VE GOT THE RIGHT IDEA. LOOK OUT! GIVE YOU A LIFT? THAT'S OKAY. WE'LL WALK. I THINK YOU'LL BE MUCH SAFER INSIDE THE CAR. MOVE. SOMEONE REAL IMPORTANT WANTS TO SEE YOU. AFTER YOU, GORGEOUS. I SUPPOSE YOU BLAME ME FOR THIS TOO. [Tires Squealing] OH, MY GOODNESS. I'LL SAY ONE THING FOR MR. ALEXIS. HIS MEN ARE THOROUGH. IF THAT BOOK WAS HERE, I'M SURE THEY FOUND IT. ON THE OTHER HAND, I GOT NO REASON TO BELIEVE IT WAS EVER ACTUALLY HERE TO BEGIN WITH. YOU THINK LOUIS LIED TO YOU? YEAH, I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST HIM. OH, COLT, I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO GET MIXED UP IN LOUIS'S PROBLEMS. YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS. YEAH, WELL, YOU DON'T EITHER. HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU GET INVOLVED WITH HIM TO BEGIN WITH? I DON'T KNOW. MOTHER USED TO SAY I HAD THE GIFT OF AFFECTION, THAT I NEVER MET A MAN I DIDN'T LIKE. EVEN LOUIS. OH, I KNOW HE'S RUDE AND INSULTS EVERYBODY, BUT UNDERNEATH THAT AWFUL EXTERIOR, I'M SURE THERE'S SOME GOOD. AT LEAST I THINK THERE IS. YEAH, WELL, I THINK HE AND I HAD BETTER HAVE ANOTHER TALK. [Telephone Dialing] UH, THE NUMBER OF THE GOLDEN HORSESHOE, PLEASE. [Man] YES, I'M WELL AWARE OF WHO YOUR FRIENDS ARE, AND IF THEY EVER TRY TO SET FOOT IN THIS CASINO, THEY'LL BE MAKING A SERIOUS MISTAKE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE I CAN FIND THEM? AFTER THEY STARTED THE BRAWL, THERE WAS PANDEMONIUM. THEY COULD BE ANYWHERE, BUT IT'S MY FONDEST HOPE THAT YOU FIND THEM IN JAIL. WHAT'D HE SAY? UH, LOU STARTED A FIGHT. THEY GOT THROWN OUT OF THE CASINO. WHICH MEANS THEY LOST WHATEVER PROTECTION THEY HAD. IT ALSO MEANS THEY'RE IN BIG TROUBLE. WARREN ALEXIS IS NOT A MAN WHO ACCEPTS FAILURE. THAT'S WHY YOU GOTTA HELP ME GET TO HIM. COLT, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HIS PERSONAL SECRETARY. IF HE FINDS OUT I'M HOOKED UP WITH LOUIS, IT'S GOOD NIGHT, CRYSTAL. BUT IF YOU DON'T, IT'S GOOD NIGHT FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. HI, SCOTTY. HELLO, MR. CONNOR. GO RIGHT ON IN. ♪♪ [Mellow Jazz On Radio] [Woman Laughing] I'M ONLY GOING TO ASK YOU ONE MORE TIME. WHERE'S THAT NOTEBOOK? WHAT DO YOU CARE? IT WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO READ. [Grunts] HEY! CAN'T YOU TAKE A JOKE? THE TIME FOR HUMOR IS LONG GONE, CARNESCO. PERHAPS YOUR FRIEND MR. SEAVERS CAN GIVE ME AN ANSWER. COLT DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING. MAYBE NOT. OR HE NEVER COULD HAVE GOTTEN INVOLVED WITH SUCH A LOW FORM OF HUMAN LIFE. WE'LL CONTINUE THIS AFTER MY GUESTS ARE GONE. - I DON'T WANT TO MISS THE PARTY. - YES, SIR. - LOU... - HEY. IT'S NO PROBLEM. JUST IN CASE I DON'T GET A CHANCE TO TELL YOU LATER, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE THE BIGGEST JERK I'VE EVER MET. COME ON, HOWIE. NOW DON'T TRY AND DEFEND HIM! YOU DON'T KNOW HALF OF WHAT THIS IDIOT'S PUT US THROUGH. COLT'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE, AND HE'S NOT GONNA LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO US. - 2-TO-1 YOU'RE WRONG. - YOU GOT A BET. I'LL TAKE A PIECE OF THAT ACTION. MISS CRYSTAL. I MUST SAY, YOU CERTAINLY PULLED ONE OUT OF THE FIRE LAST WEEK. THANKS, MR. ALEXIS. [Chuckles] ONLY NEXT TIME TRY TO GIVE US A LITTLE BREATHING ROOM. I DON'T THINK I CAN HANDLE ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE, UH, CARDIAC FINISHES. [Chuckles] I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR THAT KIND OF SUSPENSE. SO ENJOY YOURSELF, FELLAS. THERE'S PLENTY OF FOOD AND... OTHER GOODIES. SO DON'T BE SHY, EH? HI, LADIES. HELLO. HI, GUYS. CRYSTAL, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL DAY? I'VE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR YOU. OH, WARREN. MR. ALEXIS, MAY I TALK TO YOU? PRIVATELY? EXCUSE ME. COME. WHAT IS IT? YOU KNOW THAT CAR WE WERE CHASING LAST NIGHT? I CHECKED OUT THE TAGS. SO? IT'S OWNER IS A SHOWGIRL NAMED BRANDY HOLMES. SHE WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT IT BEING SMASHED, BUT SHE SAID ALL SHE HAD DONE WAS LOAN IT TO A FRIEND. WHAT FRIEND? CRYSTAL. I'M SORRY, MR. ALEXIS. COME. WARREN, YOU'RE HURTING ME! I INTENDED TO. COME WITH ME. COME ON. WAIT A MINUTE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? CRYSTAL, WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? LOU, PLEASE SHUT UP! WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SHUT UP? IF YOU HURT HER... NOT YET, CARNESCO. BUT I WILL IF YOU DON'T GET THAT BOOK. IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO DAMAGE SUCH GOODS. BUT THEN, THEY'RE EASY TO REPLACE. IN SPITE OF HER EXPENSIVE TRAPPINGS, CRYSTAL IS REALLY VERY CHEAP. [Gasps] FOR GOD SAKES, LOU, WILL YOU TELL HIM WHAT HE WANTS TO KNOW? ALEXIS, YOU DINGBAT, LISTEN TO ME. THERE'S NO BOOK. NEVER WAS. I WAS JUST KIDDING AROUND. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT WAS ALL A CON, A HUSTLE, I SWEAR. I COULDN'T PIN ANYTHING LIKE THAT ON A GUY LIKE YOU. I WAS DESPERATE. LOOK, YOU WANNA BREAK BOTH MY LEGS? HERE THEY ARE. YOU WANNA KILL ME, FINE. BUT CRYSTAL JUST WASN'T IN THIS THING. PLEASE LET HER GO. I'M SORRY, LOU. THIS TIME YOUR MOUTH WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR. - [Howie] WELL, WHAT ABOUT US? - YEAH. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S GOIN' ON. WELL, MY DEAR, THIS JUST ISN'T YOUR LUCKY DAY. YOU SEE, I MUST TAKE PRECAUTIONS. TAKE 'EM OUT THE BACK WAY INTO THE DESERT... AND MAKE SURE THEY NEVER COME BACK. [Tires Squealing] WHAT'S THAT? YOU OWE ME THAT BET, BLONDIE. - GET IN! - [Grunts] DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY! MOVE! GET GOING! [All Clamoring] COME ON! GET GOING! GO! NOTHING SERIOUS. JUST A LITTLE PRANK. GO BACK AND ENJOY YOURSELF. COLT, YOU DID IT! YOU SPRUNG US! WE'RE NOT SPRUNG YET. TAKE A RIGHT AT THIS STREET. IT'LL LEAD YOU RIGHT TO THE HIGHWAY. [Tires Squealing] [Tires Squealing] [Whistle Blowing] [Tires Squealing] [Tires Squealing] [Lou] WHAT'S THE MATTER, FALL GUY? DON'T YOU LIKE REGULAR ROADS? [Bells Ringing] OH. I HOPE YOU'RE NOT AS CRAZY AS I THINK YOU ARE. FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS. FALL GUY FLYIN' CIRCUS IS ABOUT TO TAKE TO THE AIR. OH, MY GOD. PRETTY SLICK DRIVIN', COLT. THAT'S THE GREATEST JUMP I'VE EVER SEEN! I ALWAYS LIKED TRAINS. THEY SAY IT'S THE SAFEST WAY TO TRAVEL. [All Laughing] ♪ WE HEAD OUT FOR THE WIDE OPEN SPACES ♪ [Laughter Continues] ♪ UNSPOILED BY THE PASSAGE OF TIME ♪ ♪ SO LET'S HEAD FOR THE WIDE OPEN SPACES ♪♪ BYE, COLT. GOOD-BYE, CRYSTAL. [Lou] WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN', PLEA BARGAIN? I WANT A HANGING JUDGE. CAN'T I GET A LITTLE JUSTICE HERE? COLT, WILL YOU TALK TO HIM? I'M TRYING TO GET HIM A DEFENDER. THERE IS NO REASON HE SHOULD SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN JAIL. I CAN THINK OF ONE OR TWO. YEAH, SO CAN I. LIKE A CERTAIN MOBSTER WITH A MEMORY THAT WON'T QUIT. CAN'T YOU FIX IT SO THEY THROW THE BOOK AT ME? THAT'S NOT THE WAY THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS. LOOK, ALL I WANNA DO IS PAY MY DEBT TO SOCIETY. - CAN'T A GUY DO THAT ANYMORE? - YES, BUT IT'S NOT THAT EASY. LOU, IF IT MEANS THAT MUCH TO YOU, I'LL TALK TO THE JUDGE MYSELF. YOU KNOW, SEAVERS, YOU'RE NOT SUCH A BAD GUY. WELL, LET'S GRAB A BEER, AND YOU CAN JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT. YOU KNOW, UH, FEDERAL PEN, MAXIMUM SECURITY, OR HOW ABOUT A NICE CHAIN GANG? THAT'S ALWAYS FUN. OH, YOU'RE A LOT OF LAUGHS, SEAVERS. THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL ME, LOU. THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL ME. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
