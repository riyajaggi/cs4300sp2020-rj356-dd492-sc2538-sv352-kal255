 AND WAIT... AND WAIT. THE OTHER IS TO TAKE AN OCCASIONAL JOB FOR THE COURT SYSTEM... OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHERE A MAN IS CONSIDERED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE... GET OUT OF JAIL ON WHAT WE CALL BAIL. AND THEY RUN LIKE HELL. THAT'S WHERE I COME IN. I SOMETIMES PICK UP RENT MONEY TRYIN' TO FIND THEM... AND BRING THEM BACK TO JUSTICE. IT CAN BE REAL INTERESTING WORK. I REMEMBER ONE CASE IN PARTICULAR. THE GUY USED THE DARNEDEST DISGUISES TO KEEP GETTING AWAY FROM ME.

THANK YOU. [Whispers] JESUS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M DOING WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO. PACKING TO GET OUT OF HERE. HERE'S $500. YOU GO ON DOWN TO FLORIDA, WHERE YOU HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME, TILL THIS THING BLOWS OVER. I CAN'T GO TO FLORIDA. I GAVE MY NAME TO THE POLICE AS A WITNESS, AND I PROMISED I'D SHOW UP IN COURT. UH, LOOK, HERE'S, UH, $1,500. I DON'T WANT TO EVER SEE YOUR FACE AGAIN. [Woman] WE'RE ALL SET, JODY. COLT CALLED FOR DOUBLE BAGS, TWICE THAT AREA. THAT WOULD OVERHANG THE AWNING AND RUIN THE DIRECTOR'S SHOT. HOW MUCH LONGER BEFORE WE GET GOING? I'D SAY ABOUT TWO MINUTES AT MOST. WE'RE GONNA ROLL IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES. OKAY, STAND BY FOR THE JUMP. WHICH LINE DOES SHE COME DOWN ON? SAM, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? SHOOTING A MOVIE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M SAVING YOUR TAIL AND JODY'S. BECAUSE IF THIS IS THE NEW JUMP, JODY AIN'T MAKIN' IT. IT'S ALL BEEN CHECKED OUT. DIANA SAID IT'S SAFE. SHE WANTS TO PLEASE YOU, SAM. AND YOU WON'T BE PLEASED. THESE AIR BAGS ARE TOO CLOSE TO THE BUILDING. THE ARC FROM THAT HEIGHT WILL CARRY HER RIGHT INTO YOUR CAMERA. COLT, COME HERE, WILL YA! WHAT ARE YA GONNA DO? I'VE GOT TWO QUALIFIED STUNTMEN ARGUING OVER THE SAME STUNT. I'M GOING WITH THE ONE I HIRED. DIANA, COLT SEAVERS SAYS THE STUNT ISN'T GAFFED RIGHT. WELL, I'LL DO IT MYSELF AND PROVE HE'S WRONG. NO, I'LL DO IT! TOO BAD. - YOU'VE JUST BEEN FIRED. - WHAT? I'LL BE READY IN A FEW MINUTES, BY THE TIME YOU FINISH THE SETUP. HOLD IT. GET OUT OF HERE, COLT! - WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE? - SAM, CAN YOU HEAR ME? COLT, GET OFF THAT ROOF! NOW! NOT UNTIL WE SETTLE A LITTLE BET. WHAT'S HE DOING UP THERE? I'M GONNA LET THIS LIGHT STAND TAKE A FREE FALL STRAIGHT DOWN. IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, YOU STAY RIGHT THERE WHERE ALL THOSE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS' WORTH OF EQUIPMENT ARE. WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT? I THINK HE'S GONNA DROP THAT LAMP. COLT, YOU DROP THAT THING ON ME AND I'LL RUN YOU OUT OF TOWN. IS THAT YOUR FINAL WORD? ANYBODY MOVES, THEY LEAVE THE LOT RIGHT ALONG WITH THIS GRANDSTAND COWBOY. YEAH, COLT, THAT'S MY FINAL WORD. I WAS AFRAID IT WOULD BE. HE'S CRAZY. HE'S GONNA DROP IT. [All Chattering] [Man] THERE'S NO WAY I'M STAYING! [Woman Screams] ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY TAKE A... A SHORT BREAK, HUH? TAKE FIVE! TELL COLT, UH, I'D LIKE TO BUY HIM A DRINK IN MY TRAILER. ALL RIGHT? [Knocking] HELLO. HELLO. I'M LOOKING FOR A MR. CRAMER. OH, THERE'S NO ONE REGISTERED IN THIS ROOM. I'M GETTING IT READY FOR THE NEW GUESTS. OH. HELLO, I'M TRYING TO FIND A MR. JOHN CRAMER. HAS HE CHANGED ROOMS? OH, HE CHECKED OUT. THANK YOU. HI, IT'S SAMANTHA. PULL THE PLUG ON CRAMER. HE SKIPPED. OH. FIND COLT SEAVERS AND TELL HIM TO MEET ME IN MY OFFICE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. YOU RIDE OKAY, KID. I SPENT SIX MONTHS STUDYING CAVALRY AT WEST POINT. OH, YEAH, I FORGOT. SO, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW THAT YOU'RE UNEMPLOYED? WHAT I ALWAYS DO WHEN I RUN OUT OF STUNT WORK. HI, BIG JACK. HI, COLT. COME SIT DOWN. WHO'S YOUR FRIEND? OH, A RELATIVE. HOWIE MUNSON, SAMANTHA JACK. HELLO. I SOMETIMES CALL HER SOAPY... HER LIFE IS ONE CONTINUOUS SOAP OPERA. ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THE SOB STORY THIS TIME? WELL, A GUY RAN DOWN A KID AND THEY GOT HIM ON A HIT-AND-RUN CHARGE. LITTLE BOY ON A BICYCLE, AND THE MAN WAS APPARENTLY DRUNK. THAT WOULDN'T BE THE ONE ON YUCCA NEAR GOWER? - HOW'D YOU KNOW? - WE SAW IT. WHY DID YOU GO TO BAT FOR A GUY WHO'D RUN DOWN A KID? BECAUSE HE WAS SOBER BY THE TIME I GOT TO HIM, AND HE CONVINCED ME THAT HE WAS A LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN. ORIGINALLY, HIS BAIL WAS ONLY $15,000... AND THE MAN, CRAMER, PAID ME HIS FEE IN CASH... 1,500... AND HE GAVE ME ARIZONA REFERENCES THAT MADE HIM SOLID GOLD. THEN THE KID DIED. - HE DIED? - I'M AFRAID SO. THEN THEY RAISED THE AMOUNT OF BAIL BECAUSE OF THE NEW MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE. I PHONED CRAMER AT THE HOTEL, AND HE AGREED TO THE HIGHER FEE. I COVERED THE BAIL, HAD NEW PAPERS DRAWN UP, BUT WHEN I GOT TO THE HOTEL, HE'D ALREADY CHECKED OUT. YOU MEAN YOU PAID HIS BAIL BEFORE YOU GOT HIS MONEY? JACK, YOU ALWAYS MANAGE TO LIVE UP TO YOUR NICKNAME. SHE FALLS FOR EVERY SOB STORY. I DON'T SEE HOW YOU STAY IN BUSINESS. MY FATHER WOULDN'T HAVE HANDLED THIS ONE ANY DIFFERENTLY. BESIDES, HE WAS STAYING AT THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL. THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. LOOK, NEEDLESS TO SAY, I'M OUT OVER $100,000 IF I DON'T PRODUCE HIM. I'LL PAY YOU 10,000 TO GO AND GET HIM. YOU SURE THAT THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS CRAMER FELLA THAT YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME? - COLT, THERE IS NO CATCH. - OH, YES, THERE IS. THERE HAS TO BE. A SOLID-GOLD CITIZEN JUST RUNS OUT ON A BOND. - HE'S GOTTA KNOW YOU'RE GONNA COME AFTER HIM. - WELL, SOME PEOPLE PANIC. THEY'RE NOT AS BRAVE AS YOU. HERE IT COMES. I'M SERIOUS! FACING A MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE WAS APPARENTLY TOO MUCH FOR HIM. WHY ARE YOU ACTING SO SUSPICIOUS? BECAUSE I KNOW YOU. YOU ALWAYS LEAVE SOME LITTLE SURPRISE FOR AFTER I'VE TAKEN THE JOB. COLT, YOU DESERVE A SIMPLE ONE FOR A CHANGE. CAN'T YOU ACCEPT THAT? YOU'RE SURE HE'S NEVER BEEN ARRESTED OR SHOT HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW OR HIS DOG? EVEN IF IT NEVER GOT TO COURT OR WAS ACQUITTED? I CAN PERSONALLY GUARANTEE YOU THAT THIS MAN HAS NEVER BEEN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LAW. HERE'S YOUR EXPENSE MONEY AND PHOTOGRAPH. GOOD LUCK.

YOU JUST TELL HIM COLT SEAVERS IS WAITIN' FOR HIM OVER AT THE BAJA CANTINA. HE'LL UNDERSTAND. LET'S GO, KID. - RENFRO! - YO! FRONT AND CENTER. YEAH. DID YOU HEAR THAT? HE SAID THE MAN WE'VE COME TO HOG-TIE IS THE SHERIFF. I HEARD THE MAN. KEEP MOVING. WHERE TO? HE OWNS THE COUNTY. HE'S THE LAW. WELL, THAT IS A TEMPORARY SETBACK. TEMPORARY? LOOKS PERMANENT TO ME.

OH, DON'T GIVE ME "HOW'S IT GOING?" JACK. YOU FORGOT TO TELL ME THAT CRAMER WAS A SHERIFF. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE, COLT? HE'S VERY SUBSTANTIAL. HE OWNS HALF THE TOWN. OH, IT COULD BE MORE THAN HALF. WELL, I HAVE ABOUT A HALF A MIND TO GET OUT OF HERE WHILE I STILL CAN. COLT, WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THERE WERE THREE MEN AFTER COUNTRY JOE? WELL, NOW, JUST HOW IS THAT OUR PROBLEM? HOW'D YOU KNOW THREE GUYS WERE AFTER JOE? WELL, WHEN I CAME IN HERE THIS MORNING, THERE WERE THREE VERY LARGE MEN GOING THROUGH MY FILES. THEY ASKED ME WHERE THEY COULD FIND COUNTRY JOE, AND WHEN I SAID I WAS LOOKING FOR HIM MYSELF, THEY LEFT. WELL, JOE WILL JUST HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF TILL WE GET THIS MESS STRAIGHTENED OUT, WHICH I'M NOT SURE I WANNA TAKE ON, CONSIDERING. COLT, AFTER ALL THE TIMES THAT I'VE HELPED YOU OUT... WHAT'S A WOMAN ALONE SUPPOSED TO DO? DO YOU WANT ME TO LOSE MY BUSINESS? WOMEN! COLT, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE SHERIFF WILL DO IF HE FINDS OUT WHY WE'RE REALLY HERE? OH, HE'LL HAVE US ESCORTED TO THE COUNTY LINE. THAT'S ALL? AND THEN HAVE US BURIED UNDER IT. OH, NO. HAVEN'T YOU TWO DONE ENOUGH? WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. IN FACT, WE BARELY ESCAPED WITH OUR LIVES. TABLE FOR TWO? WHY NOT? YOU'LL JUST REPORT US TO YOUR GOOD FRIEND, THE SHERIFF. COME ON. LOOK, WE'RE NOT REALLY THAT GOOD OF FRIENDS WITH THE SHERIFF. FACT IS... THE FACT IS THAT WE'RE ONLY HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE. BUT WE'RE CURIOUS. WHY DOES EVERYBODY GO CRAZY WHEN WE MENTION HIS NAME? - BECAUSE HE CHEATED JUST ABOUT EVERYONE IN THIS TOWN. - CHEATED? HE FOUND OUT SOME CORPORATIONS WERE GONNA BUILD DEFENSE PLANTS DOWN HERE... WHEN THEY USED HIS OFFICES TO RUN SECURITY CHECKS. HE USED HIS INSIDE INFORMATION TO BUY UP ALL THE LAND, AND THEN PRACTICALLY ALL THE BUSINESSES WITH HIS PROFITS. - THERE'S MORE THAN A LITTLE RESENTMENT. - WE NOTICED. YEAH. [Man On Radio] HE SAID YOU'D KNOW WHO HE WAS. I NEVER HEARD OF HIM. WHAT KIND OF PLATES DID HIS VEHICLE HAVE? CALIFORNIA. THAT MEAN ANYTHING? TAGGART, I WANT THOSE BOYS PICKED UP, AND I WANT 'EM PICKED UP FAST. NOBODY'S TO TALK TO 'EM TILL I GET TO THEM. YOU HEAR? I HEAR. RENFRO! YO! YO. GIVE DISPATCH A DESCRIPTION OF THAT VEHICLE.

I'M USED TO IT. - YOU'RE USED TO WHAT? - BEING THE UNSUNG HERO. NEXT, YOU'LL BE TELLING ME YOU DIDN'T GET MY WIRE, WHICH IS OBVIOUS FROM THE WAY THESE CLOWNS OUT THERE HAVE BEEN TREATING ME. YOU CALLING MY DEPUTIES CLOWNS? YOU BETTER HAVE A STRONG NECK, BOY. WELL, I HOPE YOU GOT A LOT MORE DEPUTIES THAN I'VE SEEN SO FAR. AND BRIGHTER TOO. OTHERWISE, I'M... I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. COLT, UH... QUIET, OR I WON'T BE TAKIN' YOU ON ANY MORE LOCATION SCOUTS. YOU'RE PROBABLY THE ONE THAT SCREWED THAT TELEGRAM UP TO THE SHERIFF. NOW, DID YOU SEND THAT OR NOT? WELL, I, UH... HOLD IT! I'M ASKING THE QUESTIONS HERE. WE FOUND THE PROBLEM. NEPOTISM. HOLLYWOOD IS CRAWLING WITH IT. I DON'T SEE HOW WE EVER MADE A MOVIE UNDER $20 MILLION... WITH COUSINS LIKE THAT RUNNIN' AROUND LOOSE. WELL, NOT EXACTLY ON THE LOOSE AT THE MOMENT, THANKS TO YOU, SHERIFF. YOU THINK WE COULD GET THESE HANDCUFFS OFF SO WE COULD GET DOWN TO... YOU TALK FASTER THAN A PREACHER DURING COLLECTION. - COME ON. WHO ARE YOU? - BURT REYNOLDS. YOU AIN'T BURT REYNOLDS. TRUE. SOMETIMES, I'M ROBERT REDFORD. TAGGART. YES, SIR. CALL THE COUNTY KOOK SQUAD. WE GOT A MAJOR LOONY HERE. LOOK, SHERIFF, WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU IS THAT I'M A MAJOR HOLLYWOOD STUNTMAN, AND I'M HERE TO SET UP A SHOOTING SITE FOR OUR NEXT HIGH-BUDGET MOVIE. I MEAN, YOU CAN CHECK IT ALL OUT, PROVIDING IT'S WORTH THE EFFORT. NO POINT IN GETTING INTO BUSINESS, THOUGH, UNTIL I HEAR YOUR TERMS. - MY TERMS? TERMS FOR WHAT? - TO RENT YOUR DEPARTMENT. RENT MY DEPARTMENT? I MEAN OFFICERS, PATROL CRUISERS, UNIFORMS... EVERYTHING WE'LL NEED TO STAGE A REAL HIGH-SPEED CHASE RIGHT THROUGH YOUR COUNTY. - THROUGH MY COUNTY? - WELL... OR THE NEXT COUNTY. COUNTRY PRETTY MUCH LOOKS ALL THE SAME. I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD YOU'RE SAYIN'. LOOK, SHERIFF, I-I CAN PROVE WHO I AM. ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS CALL FALL GUY STUNT ASSOCIATION IN HOLLYWOOD. HOLLYWOOD. AND I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK THAT I WAS THE DUMB ONE IN THE FAMILY. SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU? NO, NO. HOW COULD YOU THINK THAT? HERE I AM WITH THE GREATEST LEGEND EVER TO COME OUT OF PEA FALLS. A MAN WHO JUMPS HIGH BUILDINGS, LEAPS OUT OF AIRPLANES, CRASHES INTO CONCRETE WALLS. MY HERO. AND WHAT HAPPENS ON THE FIRST JOB WE GO ON? I GIVE UP. WHAT HAPPENS? WE DIE, COLT. WE DIE LIKE DOGS, GUNNED DOWN IN OUR PRIME. YOU'RE EVEN SCARING ME. YOU'RE NOT TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY, COLT, AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY. I HAVE A PLAN. A PLAN. THIS IS SOME PLAN. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY CHECK YOU OUT AND FIND OUT WHY WE'RE REALLY HERE? OH, HE'S GONNA CALL THAT NUMBER I GAVE HIM IN LOS ANGELES, AND THEY'RE GONNA TELL HIM I'M A STUNTMAN. THEN HIS GREED TAKES OVER. THERE'S NO ONE IN THIS TOWN THAT COULD POSSIBLY TELL HIM WHY WE'RE REALLY HERE. THAT'S RIGHT, ISN'T IT? THERE'S NO ONE IN THIS TOWN WHO KNOWS WHY WE'RE HERE OR WHAT YOU DO FOR A SIDELINE. THAT'S RIGHT. JOE? YEAH? I HOPE WE'RE DOIN' THE RIGHT THING. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE. HONEY, LOOK, COLT SEAVERS IS DOWN HERE ON A BOUNTY HUNT. NOW, HE'S THE ONE MAN IN THE WHOLE WORLD THAT WE CAN TRUST TO SAVE OUR LIVES. YOU BOYS ARE FREE TO GO. SHERIFF SAYS HE'LL MEET YOU AT THE BAJA CANTINA AT 8:00 FOR DINNER. HIS GUESTS. WELL, YOU TELL THE SHERIFF WE'LL BE THERE. OKAY. YEE-HAW! BOY, YOU SURE DO DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN, SHERIFF. 20,000 IT IS.

TO GATHER ALL YOUR DEPUTIES IN THE COUNTY TOGETHER AT ONCE. - WHAT FOR? - WELL, UH, DRIVING SKILLS. I MEAN, I GOTTA JUDGE WHO'S THE BEST, AND WE GOTTA SEE WHO CAN DO WHAT. WE DON'T WANT TO GET ANYBODY KILLED NOW. YEAH, YEAH. UH, WELL, JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED AND WHEN. WELL, TOMORROW MORNING. AND WE'LL START RIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF THE JAILHOUSE.

THE DUDES THAT WERE TRYING TO MUSCLE IN ON MANAGING ME. SEE, THEY WERE USING MY TOURING BUS AT CONCERTS TO DISTRIBUTE THE DRUGS AROUND THE COUNTRY. THEY ALWAYS SHOW UP AT MY GIG, YOU KNOW. THEY WERE ALL FRIENDLY AND SMILING AND... IT WAS NO WONDER. THEY WERE STASHING AWAY... ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN THE PANEL OF HIS BIG BUS. THAT'S RIGHT. AND MY MISTAKE WAS ACCIDENTALLY FINDING THE DRUGS. WHEN I FOUND 'EM, I GOT RID OF 'EM, OF COURSE. NO WONDER THEY'RE CHASING YOU. BUT YOU TOLD 'EM WHAT YOU'D DONE WITH IT. YOU THINK THEY BELIEVED ME? I WENT TO MY MANAGER AND TOLD HIM WHAT WAS HAPPENING. SO HE CONFRONTED THEM AND TOLD THEM TO LET ME ALONE OR HE'D CALL THE POLICE. - SO THEY BEAT HIM UP. - AND THEY USED MY NAME A LOT TOO, SEE? AND HIS WIFE HEARD IT. THAT'S WHY SHE HAD ME PUT IN JAIL. WHICH WAS FINE, 'CAUSE I WOULD BE SAFE THERE. BUT, SEE, NOREEN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON, SO SHE CAME AND BAILED ME OUT. THAT'S WHY I WAS AT THE PALOMINO CLUB TRYING TO RAISE ME A STAKE... TO GET ME AND HER AND THE KID OUT OF TOWN. THAT'S WHEN I SHOWED UP. BOY, AND DID YOU SAVE MY LIFE, COLT. 'CAUSE THAT WAS PAYOFF NIGHT, AND THEY WERE GONNA GET THEIR DRUGS, OR THEY WERE GONNA TAKE ME AND NOREEN AND THE KID OUT AND WASTE US. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? AT LEAST I COULD'VE GOTTEN SOME HELP. COMIN' DOWN HERE WAS THE WORST THING YOU COULD'VE DONE. YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR ZONE. WELL, CAN'T WE GO TO THE LOCAL SHERIFF FOR PROTECTION? GREAT IDEA. NEXT. JOE, I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT YOU STUMBLED INTO HERE, BUT YOU GOTTA LEAVE. BUT I CAN'T. THEY'RE CHASING ME. THEY'RE ONLY HALF A DAY BEHIND ME. COLT, IF THOSE GUYS PULL INTO TOWN... YEAH, I KNOW. LOOK, WE'LL HANDLE YOUR FRIENDS, BUT YOU GOTTA GET BACK ON THE ROAD, AND DON'T STOP. - BUT WHERE? WHERE DO I GO? - GO SOUTH, THEN CUT OVER. TAKE THE INTERSTATE BACK TO L.A. - AND THEN YOU GO STRAIGHT TO SOAPY. - ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN HOLD 'EM? IF YOU HAD ANYBODY ELSE YOU COULD TRUST, WOULD YOU HAVE DRIVEN YOUR FAMILY THIS FAR? I LOVE YOU FOR THIS, MAN, AND I WON'T FORGET IT, BELIEVE ME. ONE LAST QUESTION. IT MIGHT MAKE THE DIFFERENCE... WHETHER ANY OF US GET OUT OF THIS COUNTY ALIVE. HOW DID YOU FIND ME? NO ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHERE I WAS. THROUGH YOUR ANSWERING SERVICE. I CALLED 'EM, AND THEY SAID YOU WERE DOWN HERE. THEY SAID I COULD REACH YOU THROUGH THE LOCAL SHERIFF. WHO'D BE DUMB ENOUGH TO... COLT, YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HAVING TO BE INCOGNITO DOWN HERE. I THOUGHT WE'D BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LOCAL SHERIFF, AND SO I LEFT THE NUMBER IN CASE MY MOTHER... YOUR MOTHER? I'LL CANCEL IT. JOE, WHAT DID YOU TELL THE SHERIFF? WELL, I NEVER REALLY SAW HIM. I WAS ON MY WAY TO HIS OFFICE, AND THEN I SPOTTED YOUR TRUCK. [Sighs] WELL, YOU'D BETTER GET GOING. WE GOT A LOT TO DO IF WE'RE GONNA INTERCEPT YOUR FRIENDS. YOU GOT IT. WELL, WE'RE KIND OF BUSY DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW. CAN'T YOU KEEP THAT CAT LOCKED UP OR SOMETHIN'? PIECE OF CAKE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. YOU'RE GONNA BREAK YOUR NECK GOIN' UP, OR YOU'RE GONNA GET SHOT COMIN' OUT. GEEZ, HAVE A LITTLE FAITH, WILL YA? IT'S WHAT I DO FOR A LIVIN', REMEMBER? YOU STAY PUT. YEP. I FIGURE I'M GONNA BUY ME THAT NEW SHOTGUN. MY WIFE'S MOTHER WANTS A NEW SET OF DRAPES. WHAT? YEAH. NEW SET OF DRAPES. YOU JUST BOUGHT HER SOME FUZZY SLIPPERS. MAN, THAT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE. I BELIEVE SHE'S TAKIN' ADVANTAGE OF YOU. LET ME HAVE SOME OF THAT LIZARD SWEAT SHE CALLS COFFEE. - YOU BETTER BE GLAD YOU'RE GETTIN' ANYTHING. - JUST LET ME HAVE A SWIG OF IT.

THIS TIME, WE'RE GONNA BE SURE. - HE'S GOT US! - GOT US? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GOT US? HOW? YOU TELL ME. THE WHEELS ARE JUST SPINNIN'. BE SURE IT'S TIGHT. HAVE A NICE DAY, FELLAS. WE'LL LEAVE A NOTE EXPLAINING YOU TO THE SHERIFF. MORNIN', COLT. MORNIN', SHERIFF. BOY, THEY'RE GONNA BE GOOD IN THE MOVIE. SOME OF 'EM LOOK REAL MEAN, DON'T THEY? YEAH. REAL MEAN. THEY'LL BE FINE, SHERIFF. YEP. NOW, EXACTLY, UH, WHAT DO YOU WANT MY BOYS TO DO? WELL, I'LL LEAD THE WAY STRAIGHT SOUTH. THEN IT'LL JUST BE UP TO YOUR DEPUTIES TO TRY AND CATCH ME. [Cramer] THEY'RE ALL LOOKIN' FORWARD TO THAT, HUH? SO AM I, SHERIFF. WELL, WHEN I TAKE OFF, I WANT EACH OF YOUR BOYS NOW JUST TO TROMP ON THEM SUCKERS...
