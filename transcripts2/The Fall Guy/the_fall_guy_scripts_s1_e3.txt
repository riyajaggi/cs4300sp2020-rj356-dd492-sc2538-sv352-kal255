I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN HIM, BUT YOU NEVER KNEW WHO HE WAS. YOU'VE CHEERED FOR HIM AND CRIED FOR HIM, WOMEN HAVE WANTED TO DIE FOR HIM. BUT DID HE EVER GET ANY CREDIT? OR THE GIRL? NO. HE WAS WHAT WE CALL A STUNTMAN. AND THE REASON I'M TALKIN' SO FONDLY ABOUT HIM IS... WELL, BECAUSE IT'S ME, COLT SEAVERS. ANYWAY, PICTURE WORK ISN'T WALL-TO-WALL EMPLOYMENT. SO MAYBE YOU WONDER HOW A GUY KEEPS HIS HEAD TOGETHER. WELL, ONE WAY IS TO WAIT BY THE PHONE... AND WAIT... AND WAIT. THE OTHER IS TO TAKE AN OCCASIONAL JOB FOR THE COURT SYSTEM... OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHERE A MAN IS CONSIDERED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE... GET OUT OF JAIL ON WHAT WE CALL BAIL. AND THEY RUN LIKE HELL. THAT'S WHERE I COME IN. I SOMETIMES PICK UP RENT MONEY TRYIN' TO FIND THEM... AND BRING THEM BACK TO JUSTICE. "A" CAMERA READY. "B" CAMERA READY. "C" CAMERA READY. [Man On Speaker] OKAY, FELLAS, LOOK SHARP! HERE COMES THE PLANE. HEADS UP, GUYS! I'M BRINGIN' IT IN! I'M WAITIN' FOR YOU, JODY. NOW MAKE IT NICE AND SMOOTH. [Man On Speaker] JODY, YOU'RE OFF LINE! BACK OFF! YOU'RE UP TOO FAR! NO GOOD, GUYS. LET'S DO IT AGAIN. OKAY, RON, SLIDE OVER. TAKE THE WHEEL. WHOA, KID! SMOOTH! SMOOTH! KEEP IT SMOOTH! LET'S TRY ANOTHER ONE. OKAY. LOOKS GOOD. LOOKS GOOD. I HIT SOME AIR TURBULENCE! I CAN'T HOLD HER, COLT! YES, YOU CAN! YES, YOU CAN! YOU'RE DOIN' GREAT. - KID, YOU ALMOST TOOK MY HEAD OFF. - SORRY, COLT. OKAY, THIS ONE'S A PRINT. I CAN FEEL IT, COLT. WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT, JODY. ONE MORE TIME FOR COLT SEAVERS. I COULD GET OLD DOIN' THIS. GOOD! GOOD, JODY, GOOD! NOW DON'T CUT ME IN HALF! I DON'T THINK YOU COULD STAND TWO OF ME! HEY, COWBOY, YOU WANT A RIDE? DON'T MIND IF I DO. OKAY, I'M ON. WE GOT A PRINT. [Woman] AU REVOIR JEANS. FOR THE MAN WHO LIKES TO LIVE BY THE SEAT OF HIS PANTS. THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING I EVER SAW. WHAT A WASTE OF GOOD STUNTS. I MEAN, HOW DID YOU EVER TALK ME INTO DOING TWO MORE OF THOSE COMMERCIALS? WELL, WE NEEDED THE MONEY. YOU KNOW, THE STRIKE HURT EVERYONE. THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO MAKE MONEY. I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT, BECAUSE BIG JACK WANTED TO DROP BY AND SEE YOU TONIGHT. BIG JACK IS NOT A BETTER WAY. AH, BE REASONABLE, COLT. WE HAVEN'T BEEN OUT ON A CASE SINCE YOU GOT OUT OF TRACTION. THAT LAST ONE PUT ME IN TRACTION, REMEMBER? I'M NOT GOING OUT ON ANOTHER BOUNTY HUNT. [Big Jack] COLT. I TOLD YOU THAT'S FINAL. NOW HIS NAME IS E. CHARLES NEIMAN. HE'S A VERY PROMINENT BEVERLY HILLS BUSINESSMAN... YES. WHO WAS ARRESTED FOR EMBEZZLING 10 MILLION DOLLARS' WORTH OF BONDS... FROM HIS OWN BROKERAGE HOUSE. I DO KEEP UP WITH THE NEWS. WHERE'D HE SKIP OFF TO? LONDON? ROME? PARIS? YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LIKE TO TRAVEL. HOWIE, HE DIDN'T SKIP OFF ANYWHERE. HE'S RIGHT HERE IN TOWN. LOOK, IF HE HASN'T JUMPED BAIL, THEN WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING ME? TO BRING HIM DOWNTOWN SO I CAN REVOKE HIS BOND. I WANT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH E. CHARLES NEIMAN. [Howie] WELL, WHY NOT? A WELL-TO-DO WHITE-COLLAR CRIMINAL. HE'LL PROBABLY HIRE HIMSELF A TEAM OF EXPENSIVE LAWYERS AND GET OFF SCOT-FREE. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN I POSTED THE BOND TO THE TUNE OF $500,000. [Whistles] THAT IS A HEFTY SUM. I HOPE YOU GOT SOME COLLATERAL. I CERTAINLY DID. HIS MALIBU BEACH HOUSE. WELL, THEN, YOU'RE WELL PROTECTED. EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. HE SOLD IT RIGHT AFTER THAT. I DIDN'T THINK HE COULD DO THAT. I DIDN'T EITHER. BUT WE'RE DEALING WITH THE PRIVILEGED CLASS. HE'S A SPOILED EGOMANIAC WHO THINKS HE CAN BEND THE RULES TO SUIT HIMSELF. JACK, YOU KNOW HOW I HATE TO RISK MY NECK. COLT, I'M PREPARED TO PAY YOU HANDSOMELY FOR MY MISTAKE. $500 A DAY. ON THE OTHER HAND, I HATE TO SEE YOU PLAYED FOR A SUCKER. NOW WHERE JUST MIGHT I FIND THIS E. CHARLES NEIMAN? [Howie] WHAT IS THIS CAVALIER CLUB ANYWAY? [Colt] IT'S A PRIVATE CLUB WHERE PEOPLE WITH MONEY TO BURN CAN BUY SOME PRIVACY. [Man] LET ME GET TO THE POINT, AL. I THOUGHT I HAD COMMITTED THE PERFECT CRIME. I NEVER EXPECTED THE BANK TO DISCOVER IT THAT QUICKLY. [Chuckles] WHO SAYS GOOD GUYS DON'T GET BAD BREAKS. TELL ME, HOW CAN I RIGHT THIS GROSS INJUSTICE? I AM SITTING ON 10 MILLION DOLLARS' WORTH OF TRACEABLE BONDS. I NEED TO CONVERT THEM INTO CASH. CAN YOU HELP ME? YOU GIVE ME TWO WEEKS AND I'LL GET YOU 75 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. I HAVEN'T GOT TWO WEEKS. MY HEARING'S ON FRIDAY. I DON'T INTEND TO BE THERE. FRIDAY? CHARLIE, YOU'RE... YOU'RE TALKING THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. OR SOONER. I HAD TO UNLOAD THE COLLATERAL FOR MY BAIL. THAT MEANS THE BONDING COMPANY IS GONNA COME AFTER ME. AND THE LAST THING I WANT IS TO BE PUT BACK IN JAIL ON A MERE TECHNICALITY. IS THIS A GAG? NO, IT'S A TRUCK. WELL, WHERE DO YOU EXPECT ME TO PARK IT? PUT IT RIGHT OUT FRONT. SHOW IT OFF. YEAH, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TRUCK. MR. NEIMAN DOESN'T EXACTLY KEEP A LOW PROFILE. [Chuckling] [Woman] THAT'S GREAT. YOU LIKE IT? THAT'S A FUNNY JOKE. YEAH, AND IT'S MINE TOO. OH. COLT! HIYA, KID! HEY, MILTON, HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU. HEY, HOWIE, THIS IS MILTON BERLE. I DID A STUNT FOR HIM ON A MOVIE ONCE. AT MY AGE, I NEED A STUNTMAN TO PUT ON MY MAKEUP. - ENJOY THE CLUB. - THANK YOU, MR. BERLE. I HEAR THIS IS THE TOP PLACE IN THE CITY FOR FOOD AND DANCING. WHO KNOWS FROM DANCING? I COME HERE FOR THE TAKEOUTS. [Laughing] COLT, THIS IS A PRIVATE CLUB. AREN'T WE GONNA NEED A LITTLE PULL TO GET INSIDE? I'LL USE ONE OF MILTON'S LINES. HELLO. HELLO. CAN I HELP YOU? YES, WE'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO MR. E. CHARLES NEIMAN. ARE YOU MEMBERS, MR... SEAVERS. COLT SEAVERS. NO, WE JUST CAME IN TO REPORT THE ACCIDENT. - ACCIDENT? - IN THE PARKING LOT. THAT IS HIS ROLLS-ROYCE, ISN'T IT? - YES. WHAT HAPPENED? - OH, NOTHING MUCH. YOU CAN HARDLY SEE WHERE WE HIT IT. YES. SO I'D LIKE TO GIVE HIM THE NAME OF MY INSURANCE COMPANY. - SO IF YOU'D PLEASE GET HIM. - FRANK, YOU WATCH THE DOOR WHILE I STEP INSIDE. - EXCUSE ME, MR. MAGLIA. - OH, YES, SALLY? THERE'S A MR. SEAVERS AT THE DOOR, WANTS TO SEE MR. NEIMAN. SAYS HE SMASHED INTO HIS CAR. NOT MY ROLLS? THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. OH, PLEASE. HOLD IT. HOLD IT. YOU GO TELL HIM THAT MR. NEIMAN WILL BE RIGHT THERE. OKAY? OKAY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. CHARLIE, IF YOUR CAR WAS HIT, MY PARKING LOT ATTENDANT WOULD HAVE REPORTED IT. I MEAN, WE CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL IF SOME BAIL BONDSMAN'S ONTO YOU. WELL, I TAKE MY HAT OFF TO YOU, AL. LOOKS LIKE I CAME TO THE RIGHT MAN AFTER ALL. HE'LL BE RIGHT OUT. OH, SO TELL ME, UH, WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE BELONG TO THIS CLUB ANYWAY? IT'LL TAKE TWO GRAND AND A NEW SET OF THREADS FOR YOU TO FIND THAT OUT. WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS SPACE GAMES AND A SIX-PACK AT HOME. [Engine Starts] [Tires Squealing] - COLT, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - SIT TIGHT. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [Tires Squealing] HEY! HEY, WHERE'S MY TIP?

I WAS HIRED BY A BONDSMAN TO PICK UP THE MAN DRIVING THAT CAR... E. CHARLES NEIMAN. WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE HE'S ABOUT TO SKIP TOWN. I HAVE HIS BOND RECEIPT RIGHT HERE. BE RIGHT BACK. DID YOU SAY YOU WANTED TO APPREHEND THE MAN THAT WAS DRIVIN' THIS CAR? IS THAT HIM? THAT'S HIM, OFFICER. THAT'S THE CREEP THAT WAS HUSTLIN' ME ALL THROUGH LUNCH. SCARED ME TO DEATH.

DID YOU SEE NEIMAN? YEAH. RIGHT AFTER YOU TOOK OFF, THEY SLIPPED HIM OUT THE BACK IN A BLACK PORSCHE. I COULDN'T GIVE THEM MUCH OF A CHASE ON FOOT. GREAT! THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF JACK'S SIMPLE PICKUPS. BUT I DID GET HIS LICENSE NUMBER. FANTASTIC. GET IN. ACCORDING TO THE D.M.V., THE CAR THAT SMUGGLED NEIMAN RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER OUR NOSES... IS REGISTERED TO AN ALBERT MAGLIA OF BEL AIR. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK NEIMAN IS AT THIS GUY MAGLIA'S HOUSE? I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE.

UH, TELLY SAID THERE WOULD BE A PASS. I'M HIS HAIRDRESSER. [Howie] THAT'S THE CAR. AND THAT'S NEIMAN INSIDE IT. THERE'S NO WAY THIS TRUCK'S GONNA KEEP UP WITH THAT PORSCHE. WHY, YOU DON'T THINK SO? WELL, THAT CAR GOES FROM ZERO TO A HUNDRED IN 10 SECONDS. ITS TOP SPEED'S 150. I'D CALL THAT A LOST CAUSE, COLT. NOT WITH A FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE. [Howie] HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE THIS TRAIL COMES OUT? [Colt] I'VE SHOT EVERY INCH OF THESE HILLS IN THE MOVIES WE'VE DONE. THIS IS WHAT WE CALL "HEADING THEM OFF AT THE PASS." - WE'RE RUNNIN' OUT OF ROAD! - HOLD ON, KID, WE'RE GOIN' AIRBORNE! COLT! LOOK OUT! WHERE'D SHE COME FROM? NEIMAN'S GETTING AWAY! WAIT. SHE LOOKS HURT. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MA'AM? [Colt] HEY, WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? WHO ARE YOU, LADY? I WARN YOU. I'M QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO USING FIREARMS. - LADY, GO EASY NOW. COME ON. - WHY WERE YOU CHASING MR. NEIMAN? WELL, YOU PUT THAT GUN AWAY AND I MIGHT TELL YOU.

STOP IT, YOU TWO! YOU'RE GOING TO GET US ALL ARRESTED! OH. OKAY, UM, I HAVE A LEGAL PAPER TO BE CARRYING THAT GUN. I HAPPEN TO BE MR.

NOW COME ON, YOU TWO. WHAT'S THE STORY? LADY, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE PAYING ATTENTION. NOW THIS IS A COLT .45, AND YOU'RE OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, PRACTICALLY HELPLESS.

LOOK, PAL, WHAT IS IT WITH YOU? YOUR CREDENTIALS SAY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GUY, AND YOU SPEND HALF YOUR TIME CHASING WOMEN. - I'M FUNNY THAT WAY. - YEAH, BUT I'M NOT LAUGHING. LADY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SWEAR OUT A COMPLAINT FOR THIS MAN'S ARREST? - I'D BE GLAD TO HAUL HIM IN. - HAUL HIM IN? UH, NOW WHAT WOULD THAT ENTAIL, OFFICER? WELL, YOU JUST FOLLOW US DOWNTOWN AND YOU SWEAR OUT A CHARGE FOR ATTEMPTED ASSAULT. NO, I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY. BUT I DO BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT GUN.
