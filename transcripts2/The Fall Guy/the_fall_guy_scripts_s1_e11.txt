I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN HIM, BUT YOU NEVER KNEW WHO HE WAS. YOU'VE CHEERED FOR HIM AND CRIED FOR HIM, WOMEN HAVE WANTED TO DIE FOR HIM. BUT DID HE EVER GET ANY CREDIT? OR THE GIRL? NO. HE WAS WHAT WE CALL A STUNTMAN. AND THE REASON I'M TALKIN' SO FONDLY ABOUT HIM IS... WELL, BECAUSE IT'S ME, COLT SEAVERS. ANYWAY, PICTURE WORK ISN'T WALL-TO-WALL EMPLOYMENT. SO MAYBE YOU WONDER HOW A GUY KEEPS HIS HEAD TOGETHER. WELL, ONE WAY IS TO WAIT BY THE PHONE... AND WAIT... AND WAIT. THE OTHER IS TO TAKE AN OCCASIONAL JOB FOR THE COURT SYSTEM... OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHERE A MAN IS CONSIDERED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE... GET OUT OF JAIL ON WHAT WE CALL BAIL. AND THEY RUN LIKE HELL. THAT'S WHERE I COME IN. I SOMETIMES PICK UP RENT MONEY TRYIN' TO FIND THEM... AND BRING THEM BACK TO JUSTICE. BUT SOMETIMES I HAVE TO WORK REAL HARD TO EARN MY KEEP. [Car Door Closes] YOU BATES? YOU SEAVERS? HE'S IN THE YELLOW HOUSE. [Colt] YOU SURE HE HASN'T GONE OUT? WHY WOULD HE GO OUT? WOMEN AND FOOD KEEP GOING IN. HE HAS ALL HIS FOOD DELIVERED? CHINESE FOOD, FRIED CHICKEN, PIZZA. PIZZA? PERFECT. BY THE WAY, THANKS FOR KEEPING AN EYE ON HIM TILL I COULD GET HERE. NO PROBLEM. THE SANTA BARBARA POLICE DEPARTMENT'S ALWAYS HAPPY TO COOPERATE. YOU ALWAYS CARRY A PIZZA IN THE BACK OF YOUR TRUCK? NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA NEED ON THIS JOB. YOU'RE JUST GONNA GO RIGHT ON UP AND SLAP THE CUFFS ON HIM? OH, ARRESTING 'EM IS THE EASY PART. FINDING 'EM IS THE HARD PART. - YOU MIND IF I WATCH? - SUIT YOURSELF. ♪♪ [Rock On Stereo] [Laughter] [Doorbell Ringing] [Man] WHO IS IT? PIZZA DELIVERY. JUST A SECOND. I DIDN'T ORDER ANY PIZZA. I TOLD 'EM YOU DIDN'T LIKE ANCHOVIES. [Woman] OH, MY... HEY! [Women Chattering, Shouting] [Chattering Continues] EXCUSE ME. PARDON ME. WHAT KIND OF A PIZZA IS THAT? ONE FOR SOMEBODY WITH A CAST-IRON STOMACH. WHOA! CURLY, THIS IS HURTIN' ME MORE THAN YOU. [Grunting, Growling] THAT WAS A NICE PIECE OF WORK. [Coughing] LIKE I SAID, THE ARREST WAS THE EASY PART. HEY, THAT'S MY TRUCK! YOU'RE HURTIN' MY TRUCK! [Engine Starts] HEY, WHERE YOU GOING? HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! WAIT! [Grunting] YOU GOT A CHOICE, CURLY. YOU CAN RUN ALONGSIDE ALL THE WAY TO L.A., OR YOU CAN RIDE IN THE BACK. HURT MY TRUCK! [Man On P.A.] ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THE STUNT TEAM READY. NOW, YOU ALWAYS WALK THE ROAD BEFORE DOIN' A STUNT... BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE DRIVER KNOW EVERY INCH OF THAT ROAD, ESPECIALLY WHEN DOIN' A GAG LIKE THIS. HE SOUNDS JUST LIKE COLT. HE SHOULD. WHO DO YOU THINK TAUGHT COLT? LET'S DO IT. YEAH, WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE. ALL RIGHT, JUST ONE THING TO REMEMBER, JODY: WATCH YOUR SPEED. RIGHT. SIXTY-FIVE RIGHT ON THE NOSE. AND SUCH A CUTE NOSE AT THAT. HOLD ON, GANG. WE'LL RIDE BACK WITH YA.

EXCUSE ME, DOC. OKAY, BOYS, HERE WE GO. READY? JUST SAY WHEN. WELL, THEN LET'S GO FOR IT. [Man On P.A.] ALL RIGHT, CHOPPER. ACTION! HOLD IT STEADY, JODY. WHOO! THE HOOK'S JAMMED! I CAN'T MAKE THE HOOKUP! TAKE ME DOWN! HOLD ON! I'LL SET IT RIGHT DOWN! I CAN'T MAKE THE HOOKUP! THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CLASP! CAN'T HOLD ON ANY LONGER! [Screams] STEVE! [Gasps] STEVE! THAT'LL HANDLE THAT. ♪♪ [Whistling] JACK, I GOT HIM. OH, COLT. I'M SO GLAD I FOUND YOU. WHAT'S THAT MATTER? DIDN'T THINK I COULD HANDLE HIM? NO, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. COLT, I JUST GOT A CALL FROM HOWIE. YEAH? WHAT'S THE MATTER? SOMETHING HAPPENED OUT ON LOCATION. - DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO JODY? - NOT JODY. IT'S STEVE KRUGER. - WHAT HAPPENED? - HE FELL. - FELL? - BUT DON'T WORRY. HE'S STILL ALIVE. [Woman On P.A.] DR. MOSS, I.C.U. 5-6-7-4-4. HE'S CRITICAL, BUT STABLE. IT'S A GOOD THING HE HIT THE WATER. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. GLORIA. COLT. WHAT IF HE DOESN'T MAKE IT? HEY! HE'S GONNA MAKE IT. NO STUNT'S EVER GONNA GET STEVE. OH, BUT THIS WAS AWFULLY CLOSE. CLOSE IS WHAT STUNTS ARE ALL ABOUT.

YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I AM, SEAVERS. IF I FIND OUT THAT SAFETY PROCEDURES HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWED, IF I FIND OUT THAT NEGLIGENCE CAUSED THIS ACCIDENT, IF I FIND OUT, AS I SUSPECT I WILL, THAT THIS MOVIE HAS BEEN ONE BIG LONG PARTY... HEY, WHOA, WHOA! SLOW DOWN. DON'T TELL ME TO "WHOA, WHOA." YOU'RE NOT ROY ROGERS AND I'M NOT TRIGGER. YOU'RE GONNA BE OUT OF A JOB. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MOVIE GOES ON LOCATION.

HE'S IN A DANGEROUS LINE OF BUSINESS. [Man On P.A.] ALL RIGHT, CHECK THE CAMERAS. TWO MINUTES TO GO. COLT, ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE WAY YOU STARTED? DON'T WORRY. IT'S JUST LIKE WALKING OUT OF YOUR OWN FRONT DOOR. YEAH, WHICH IS ON FIRE. YOU'LL NEVER NOTICE THE FIRE. THAT'S FOR SURE, BECAUSE MY EYES ARE GONNA BE CLOSED. AW, COME ON, HOWIE. YOU CAN DO IT. JUST THINK. YOU'LL BE A REAL STUNTMAN. YOU CAN EVEN GET YOUR OWN FALL GUY JACKET. YEAH, MY MIND IS CONVINCED. IT'S MY LEGS THAT HAVE THE PROBLEM. YOU GUYS ABOUT READY? I GUESS SO. JUST RELAX, KID. I'LL BE IN THERE WITH YOU. WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER TO PUT ME OUT IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS? NO, WITH A LIGHTER TO MAKE SURE YOU STAY LIT. THAT HOUSE IS AS DRY AS ONE OF THOSE COW SKULLS YOU FIND OUT IN THE PASTURE. - YOU KNOW THAT? - DOES HE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE DEAD? [Man] WHEN THAT THING GOES, IT'S GONNA GO BIG. DON'T FORGET, COLT, YOU GOT 10 SECONDS... TO GET OUT THE BACK DOOR AFTER THEY YELL "ACTION." SO BOTH OF YOU GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE AS FAST AS YOU CAN... AND GET AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN. DO YOU HEAR ME?

MY RENTED CAR WAS DESTROYED. YEAH, WELL, I HOPE IT WAS INSURED. OH, VERY FUNNY. LISTEN, SEAVERS, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE TAKING THIS INVESTIGATION VERY SERIOUSLY, BUT I KNOW THAT YOU ARE JUST AS INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO STEVE AS I AM. AT LEAST IF YOU'VE GOT A BRAIN IN YOUR HEAD, YOU SHOULD BE. I DO, AND I AM. YOU GOT A LIGHT? LISTEN, I WANNA KNOW WHAT TOOK YOU OUT TO THAT JUNKYARD. [Man] COLT, WE'LL FIRE THE PLACE WHEN THEY SAY, "ROLL 'EM." IT'LL TAKE ABOUT 15 SECONDS TO GET THE FIRE GOING REAL GOOD. FINE, FINE.

WELL, I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED MYSELF THERE FOR A WHILE. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? I MEAN, YOU PEOPLE KNOW YOUR JOBS. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THESE ACCIDENTS. I DON'T THINK THEY ARE ACCIDENTS. A STATEMENT LIKE THAT NEEDS A LITTLE EXPLAINING. WELL, I HAVE A THEORY. WHAT IF SOMEBODY HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST STUNTMEN? - SAY THEY WERE JEALOUS OR SOMETHING. - JEALOUS OVER WHAT? WELL, YOU KNOW HOW MOVIE PEOPLE ARE. EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT LOCATION ROMANCES. WELL, THE ONLY PERSON STEVE SLEEPS WITH IS ME. AND I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO GET FRIENDLY, LET ALONE GET IN TROUBLE. ALL RIGHT. IT WAS A THEORY. I THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE THAN A THEORY TO STOP THESE ACCIDENTS. NO, THESE ACCIDENTS ARE GOING TO STOP, YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT. WELL, JUST HOW CAN WE COUNT ON THAT? BECAUSE I'M READY TO SHUT THIS PRODUCTION DOWN, PENDING MY INVESTIGATION. - YOU CAN'T DO THAT. - OH, YES, I CAN. ALL THESE PEOPLE'LL DRIFT APART. WE'LL NEVER FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED. AT LEAST THE ACCIDENTS WILL STOP. - I THOUGHT YOU SAID THEY WEREN'T ACCIDENTS. - OH! GOOD. FINALLY, YOU'RE STARTING TO THINK THAT MY THEORIES HAVE SOME MERIT. THANK YOU. - I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR. - YOU CAN GO AS FAR AS LOS ANGELES FOR ALL I CARE. YOU'RE OUT OF WORK. YEAH, WELL, WAIT. YOU GOT IT. I AM SHUTTING THIS CATASTROPHE DOWN NOW. LOOK, LOOK. OKAY, I'M SORRY. I ADMIT IT, I WAS WRONG. I, UH... WE, UH... ALL OF US SHOULD BE LISTENING TO A LADY OF YOUR VAST EXPERIENCE. YOU'RE SO FULL OF BULL. OH, NO, NO, KAY. HE MEANS IT. IN FACT, HE WAS TELLING ME JUST BEFORE YOU GOT HERE THAT YOU'RE OUR ONLY HOPE... OF FINDING OUT WHO'S BEHIND THIS SADISTIC NIGHTMARE THAT COULD COST YOUR COMPANY A FORTUNE. AND NOT JUST ON THIS PICTURE, BUT ON MANY MORE TO COME... UNLESS WE GIVE YOU THE TIME TO FIND OUT WHO'S AT THE BOTTOM OF IT. - MY EXACT WORDS. - OKAY. NOW THAT YOU PUT IT THAT WAY, I SEE YOUR POINT. BUT ONE MORE ACCIDENT, EVEN A LITTLE ONE, I'M PULLING THE PLUG. GOOD WORK. [Colt] HEY, DOC. YOU GOT A MINUTE? SURE. YOU GOT STEVE'S HARNESS, HUH? YEAH, I WAS CHECKING IT OUT. I-I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? THEN YOU'RE GONNA GO THROUGH WITH IT? I GAVE MY WORD. WELL, I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT. [Sighs] WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO HIM? I'VE ASKED MYSELF THAT 100 TIMES. ONLY ONE MAN KNOWS FOR SURE. WELL, IT'S FOR SURE HE CAN'T TELL US. AFTER THE ACCIDENT, WHO TOOK THIS HARNESS OFF STEVE? - PARAMEDICS, I GUESS. - THEY GAVE IT TO HIS WIFE AT THE HOSPITAL? YEAH, I GUESS SO. YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST WONDERIN', DOC. THIS LADY DETECTIVE'S GOT THIS DUMB THEORY... THAT SOMEBODY JUST MIGHT BE JEALOUS OF STUNTMEN. I MEAN, THOSE ACCIDENTS, WELL, THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY ACCIDENTS. YOU KNOW SOMETHING? I'D SAY THAT SHE'S GOT ONE HELL OF AN IMAGINATION. YEAH, WELL, I THOUGHT SO TOO. UH, YOU KNOW, IT'S A FUNNY THING. WHEN I WENT TO THE WRECKING YARD TO GET THAT GIRL'S TELEPHONE NUMBER, THAT FELLOW THOMAS ALREADY HAD THAT TRUCK IN THE CRUSHER. UH-OH. OH, SAY. HOW'D EVERYTHING GO WITH THOSE, UH, TWO GIRLS? OH, UH, WELL, WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A DOUBLEHEADER... TURNED INTO A ROUND-ROBIN. SEE YA ON THE SET. YEAH, MOBILE OPERATOR. I NEED 555-6503, PLEASE. THANK YOU. HELLO. - HOWIE. UH, GOOD. - HI, COLT. WHAT'S UP? FIRST OF ALL, I WANT YOU TO FIND GLORIA. ASK HER WHO RETURNED STEVE'S HARNESS TO HER AFTER THE ACCIDENT. OKAY. SECOND OF ALL, I WANT SOMEONE TO MEET ME. NOW? CAN'T IT WAIT TILL LUNCH BREAK? WE'RE ABOUT TO DO THE STUNT. I'M AFRAID NOT. IS KAY STILL HANGING AROUND ON THE SET? YEAH, I SAW HER LOOKING THROUGH THE CAMERA. NEXT, SHE'LL BE WANTIN' TO DIRECT. - TELL HER TO MEET ME AT THE MOTEL IN 10 MINUTES. - SHE'S GONNA WANNA KNOW WHY. JUST TELL HER I WANT TO GET INTO HER THEORIES. SHE'LL BE THERE BEFORE YOU ARE. BYE. YOU REALLY HAVE YOUR NERVE. FIRST, YOU DESTROY MY CAR. THEN YOU TRY AND BLOW ME UP. AND THEN YOU START SENDING OBSCENE INVITATIONS THROUGH INTERMEDIARIES. WHAT'S SO OBSCENE ABOUT ME WANTING TO RUN BAREFOOT THROUGH YOUR BRAIN? - YOU HAVE SUCH A WAY WITH WORDS, SEAVERS. - WELL, WHAT'S YOUR NEW THEORY? - I MEAN, WE MAY NOT HAVE MUCH TIME. - LOOK. ILLEGAL ALIENS. - ALIENS? - THAT'S RIGHT. WE'RE NEAR THE BORDER, AND THESE FILM CREWS USE LOTS OF BIG TRUCKS. IT COULD BE TRUCKS, ALL RIGHT. BUT THE ONE I'M INTERESTED IN IS TOO SMALL TO BE HAULING PEOPLE. - DRUGS. - DRUGS? OF COURSE. I SHOULD HAVE REMEMBERED HOW YOU HOLLYWOOD PEOPLE ARE. - WELL, JUST HOW THE HELL ARE WE? - ABOUT DRUGS! - LADY, I'M GONNA DECK YOU. - WOULDN'T YOU JUST LOVE THAT? - I'VE GOT IT. - SOMETIMES I THINK YOU HAVE THE I.Q. OF A HANDBALL. WHAT'S THAT? THAT'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO FIND OUT. WHERE'D YOU GET THIS? SCRAPED IT OFF THE GROUND AFTER THE CAR GAG. - SO, IT'S PAINT. - WELL, WE'LL LET THE POLICE LAB TELL US THAT, HUH? THEY'LL BE WAITIN' FOR YOU. THIS IS NUTS! IF IT IS, WHY HAVE THE TWO GUYS IN THE YELLOW STATION WAGON BEEN FOLLOWING ME? - OR WERE THEY AFTER YOUR BODY TOO? - [Forced Chuckle] TOO? ARE YOU SURE THEY'RE FOLLOWING YOU? GIVE ME A BREAK, LADY. I'VE BEEN TAILED IN MY LIFE. OKAY. OKAY, COLT. ALL IS FORGIVEN. YOU MUST BE ONTO SOMETHING. TELL ME WHERE TO REACH YOU WHEN I FIND OUT THE RESULTS. PROBABLY ON THE SET. I'LL GIVE YOU THE NUMBER.

WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT, UH, THESE TWO MEN ARE IN THE AREA. - YEAH, SO? - THEY PULLED A SIX MILLION DOLLAR GOLD HEIST IN PHOENIX. - I DIDN'T READ ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE PAPERS. - IT WASN'T IN THE PAPERS. IT WAS A GOVERNMENT BULLION TRANSFER, AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TOP SECRET. WE HAVE POSITIVE I.D.'s ON THOSE TWO. WE ALSO BELIEVE PETE THOMAS IS FENCING THE GOLD FOR THEM. HE'S DONE THIS KIND OF THING BEFORE. WE'VE BEEN WATCHING HIM. BUT THE ONLY BUSINESS HE'S BEEN DOING THESE DAYS IS THE CARS HE'S SOLD TO THE... TO THIS MOVIE. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU THINK THOMAS IS SOMEHOW USING THIS MOVIE COMPANY TO FENCE THE GOLD? WE WERE HOPING YOU COULD SORT OF BE OUR MAN ON THE INSIDE. WHAT IF I TOLD YOU HE WASN'T FENCING THE GOLD, HE'S TAKING IT OUT OF THE COUNTRY? - I'D SAY, "HOW?" - IN THE CARS THAT WE'RE USING FOR THE STUNTS. - BUT YOU'RE WRECKING 'EM. - YEAH, BUT HE'S SELLING 'EM IN MEXICO FOR SCRAP. - ARE YOU SURE? - I SOON WILL BE.
