I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN HIM, BUT YOU NEVER KNEW WHO HE WAS. YOU'VE CHEERED FOR HIM AND CRIED FOR HIM, WOMEN HAVE WANTED TO DIE FOR HIM. BUT DID HE EVER GET ANY CREDIT? OR THE GIRL? NO. HE WAS WHAT WE CALL A STUNTMAN. AND THE REASON I'M TALKIN' SO FONDLY ABOUT HIM IS... WELL, BECAUSE IT'S ME, COLT SEAVERS. ANYWAY, PICTURE WORK ISN'T WALL-TO-WALL EMPLOYMENT. SO MAYBE YOU WONDER HOW A GUY KEEPS HIS HEAD TOGETHER. WELL, ONE WAY IS TO WAIT BY THE PHONE... AND WAIT... AND WAIT. THE OTHER IS TO TAKE AN OCCASIONAL JOB FOR THE COURT SYSTEM... OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHERE A MAN IS CONSIDERED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE... GET OUT OF JAIL ON WHAT WE CALL BAIL. AND THEY RUN LIKE HELL. THAT'S WHERE I COME IN. I SOMETIMES PICK UP RENT MONEY TRYIN' TO FIND THEM... AND BRING THEM BACK TO JUSTICE. BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU CAN GET INTO SOMETHING... THAT'S WAY OVER A STUNTMAN'S HEAD. THIS IS SALEM. [Machine Gun Fire] YOU'RE A DEAD MAN, RYKER. UH-UH. I'VE GOT YOU, SALEM. NONE OF YOUR LITTLE TROLLS OR GOBLINS TO SAVE YOU THIS TIME. [Siren Wailing] [Tires Screeching] HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, PAL! AND DROP IT. NICE AND STILL, OR I'LL CUT YOU IN HALF. [Gun Clatters On Ground] THIS IS RYKER, 00-4-12. I WANT A PREPAID TICKET WAITING FOR ME AT L.A.X. TRANSCONTINENTAL AIRLINES, OPEN DESTINATION, UNLIMITED FARE. I WOULDN'T HASSLE ME IF I WERE YOU. THE NUMBER IS 555-2612. NEVER MIND WHERE IT IS. I'LL BE HERE. RYKER, CHARLES A. RYKER? ARE YOU THE BONDSMAN? OH, I'M SAMANTHA JACK. GIVE ME YOUR LIFE STORY. YOU'VE ALREADY CHECKED MY I.D. BACK TO KINDERGARTEN OR YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE. WHAT DO I OWE YOU? MR. RYKER, UNLESS YOU'D LIKE TO START ALL OVER WITH ANOTHER BONDSMAN, YOU'LL ANSWER MY QUESTIONS. WHY DOES MR. CLEAN GO RUNNING AROUND ALL OVER TOWN... BREAKING INTO SPORTING GOODS STORES AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING? I CAUGHT A GUY WITH MY WIFE, AND I'D RATHER NOT GO INTO DETAIL. WE HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS IN MY BUSINESS, MR. RYKER. I'LL HAVE TO PUT A MAN ON YOU AND CHARGE YOU FOR IT. A MAN? HE'S A PERFECT GENTLEMAN. YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW HE'S AROUND. [Screams] TELL ME WHERE YOU PUT DANNY, OR THE NEXT ONE TAKES YOUR HEAD OFF. [Growling] DID YOU SAY SOMETHING? I DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN'. YEAH, WELL SOMEBODY DID. [Growls] WHAT DO YOU GOT, ANOTHER MAN STASHED OUT THERE? HUH? IS THAT IT?

WELL, HE SEEMS TO BE KIND OF BUSY AT THE MOMENT, JACK. - THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. - NATURALLY. WHY CAN'T PEOPLE JUMP BAIL AT A DECENT HOUR? HOWIE, THIS ONE DIDN'T SKIP. I JUST NEED COLT TO BABYSIT HIM UNTIL I CAN VERIFY HIS SECURITY. HE WON'T EVEN HAVE TO LEAVE TOWN. I DON'T THINK COLT'S GONNA FEEL LIKE WORKING ANYMORE THIS WEEKEND. THE WAY I FIGURE IT, I THREW ONE, TWO, HIT, AND COLT MUST'VE BEEN EXPECTING ONE, TWO, THREE, HIT. LOU, I TOLD YOU, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. STUNTMEN ARE USED TO BEING UNCONSCIOUS. THEY LOVE IT. GOOD NIGHT, COLT. GOOD NIGHT, COLT. NOW, ABOUT THIS MOVIE. IT'S A WESTERN. HOWIE, JUST TELL HIM IT'S $500 FOR JUST A FEW HOURS' WORK. ALL HE HAS TO DO IS STAY WITH THIS GUY FROM CENTRAL JAIL...

WE GO WHERE WE WANT, WHEN WE WANT AND HOW WE WANT. WE'RE GONNA BE FREE. UH, JUST CHECKING. YEAH. COLT, YOU'RE, UH, WRONG. DON'T TURN AROUND, MR. SEAVERS, OR YOUR FRIEND STOPS BREATHING. LIE FACE DOWN ON THE BED, BOTH OF YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT... LET ME GIVE YOU A HINT, COLT. NOT RYKER? I'D RATHER NOT HAVE TO DO THIS. I CHECKED YOU OUT. YOU'RE ABOUT AS LOYAL AS THEY COME. THAT'S WHY I HOPE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT I HAVE TO DO. I DON'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY, BECAUSE I HAVE TWO CHOICES... I CAN TAKE YOUR FRIEND WITH ME OR KILL HIM. I THINK I'LL GO WITH HIM, COLT. UH, KILL HOWIE? WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? HE'S THE ONLY ONE IN HONOLULU WHO'S SEEN MY FACE AND CAN IDENTIFY ME. SO? SO IT'S WAR, SEAVERS. INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. - IT'S GOT TO BE STOPPED. - BY KILLING HOWIE? YOU AND YOUR FRIEND HAVE GOT YOURSELVES CAUGHT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. YOU'RE BEING USED. HOW? SOMEONE IS SYSTEMATICALLY SELLING US OUT TO HELP MY TARGET. NOW, THE GOVERNMENT TRIED TO CALL YOU OFF MY TRACK. SOMEBODY WANTS YOU BACK ON IT TO LEAD THEM TO ME. - WHAT TARGET? - A PIECE OF SLIME... MURDERER WHO'S TERRORIZED HALF THE WORLD. HE'S KILLED MEN, WOMEN, EVEN CHILDREN... IN THE NAME OF ANY CAUSE WILLING TO PAY HIS PRICE. - SOUNDS LIKE ONE BAD DUDE. - YEAH. IT'S TAKEN FOUR YEARS AND THE LIVES OF A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE TO GET ME IN POSITION TO STOP HIM. HEY, WE'LL HELP YOU GET HIM. RIGHT, COLT? OH, I'M WITH YOU. YEAH, UH... YEAH, WE'RE GONNA NAIL HIM. UH, LOOK, LET'S FORGET ALL THIS ABOUT KILLING HOWIE. I MEAN, HE WON'T REMEMBER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. NO, I HAVE A TERRIBLE MEMORY. I'M SORRY, SEAVERS. I'VE GOT NO CHOICE. HE CAN IDENTIFY ME. IF THEY GET THEIR HANDS ON HIM, THEY'LL USE ANY MEANS, YOU UNDERSTAND? ANY MEANS TO GET TO ME. - HIT THE FLOOR! - [Gunfire] HOWIE, LOOK OUT! CHLOROFORMED. WHERE'S RYKER? I LOST HIM FOR YOU AGAIN, COLT. [Sighs] WELL, MAYBE WE OWED HIM ONE. FOR SOME STRANGE REASON, THE FELLOW WE'RE HUNTING SAVED OUR LIVES. SPEAKING OF SAVING LIVES, COLT, UH, THANKS. THAT WAS A PRETTY BRAVE THING YOU DID, KID. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. WHOEVER WE'RE DEALING WITH IS WAY OUT OF OUR LEAGUE. ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? SHOOTING UP A HOTEL WHILE IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY? WE DIDN'T SHOOT UP A HOTEL. WE WERE INNOCENT VICTIMS. NO. THEN HOW DID YOUR FINGERPRINTS GET ALL OVER THE AUTOMATIC THAT DID ALL THE DAMAGE? - WE CAN EXPLAIN THAT. - WE CAN EXPLAIN THAT. LIEUTENANT FONG WILL BE VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT. WHAT HAPPENED TO MY GUARD? YOUR GUARD WAS CHLOROFORMED. AND IF YOUR GUARD HADN'T ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE CHLOROFORMED, WE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SHOT AT. COLT, GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT TO SHOOT AT YOU. WHO SAID THEY WERE SHOOTING AT US? WHAT ABOUT RYKER? I MEAN, ISN'T HE WORTH THE PRICE OF LEAD? RYKER WAS HERE? YOU SAW HIM? SAW HIM? WE WERE PRACTICALLY IN BED TOGETHER. THAT'S GOOD. HE DID COME AFTER YOU. YOU SOUND LIKE YOU EXPECTED IT. NEVER MIND. COLT, JUST TELL ME EVERYTHING THAT HE SAID. AND REMEMBER, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. [Phone Rings] - HELLO. - [Ryker] I KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALONE. JUST LISTEN. SEAVERS, YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE. NEITHER CAN I. I WANT TO MEET WITH YOU. THAT DIDN'T TURN OUT TOO WELL LAST TIME. - I SAVED YOUR LIVES. - YEAH, BUT YOU CAME HERE TO TAKE ONE. THAT WAS BEFORE I KNEW WHO THE TRAITOR WAS. NOW I DO. SHE'S WITH YOU IN THAT ROOM. WHAT IF I DON'T BUY THIS? ASK YOURSELF HOW I FOUND YOU. YOU'VE BEEN A DECOY ALL ALONG, AND YOU KNOW IT. THERE'S A TROLLER CALLED THE SEA WATCH IN THE MERCHANT HARBOR. I'LL BE THERE IN ONE HOUR. BRING YOUR PARTNER, AND I'LL GIVE YOU ENOUGH PROOF TO CONVINCE YOU. - IF I DON'T? - SEAVERS, YOU TELL ANYONE, YOU KILL US ALL. [Click, Dial Tone] - THAT WAS RYKER. - AND IF IT WAS? COLT, IF YOU HOLD OUT ON ME... YOU REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHO'S HOLDING OUT? ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, I'M GOING TO GET A DESCRIPTION OF HIM. GUARD, WE'RE TAKING THESE TWO GENTLEMEN BACK TO THE BASE. [Colt] BONNIE, JUST WHAT IS YOUR CONNECTION WITH RYKER? [Bonnie] COLT, THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T KNOW OF BECAUSE OF... SECURITY, I KNOW. AND I'M GETTING A LITTLE SICK OF HEARING ABOUT IT. WE ALL HAVE OUR LITTLE SECRETS. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR PHONE CALL. [Chuckles] I WISH I COULD, BUT I CAN'T. - WHY NOT? - SECURITY. IF I TELL YOU ABOUT RYKER, WILL YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE CALL? PROBABLY. RYKER WORKS FOR THE C.I.A. HE'S THEIR SELF-APPOINTED EXPERT ON SALEM. SALEM? I READ ABOUT HIM IN TIME MAGAZINE. HE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN PRACTICALLY EVERY POLITICAL KILLING IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. ALL INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE WORKING TO STOP HIM. LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU ALL JUST GET TOGETHER, OR ISN'T THERE ENOUGH GLORY TO GO AROUND? GLORY? WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TREASON. SALEM IS ALWAYS ONE STEP AHEAD OF US. THERE'S GOTTA BE ONLY ONE EXPLANATION: A LEAK. SO EVERY INTELLIGENCE UNIT THINKS THE LEAK IS COMING FROM ONE OF THE OTHER UNITS. - RIGHT. - INCLUDING YOURS? IS THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU? UH, UH, UH. YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED YOUR PART OF THE STORY YET. ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK. I THINK IT'S VERY STRANGE THAT RYKER ALWAYS MANAGES TO TURN UP ON THE SCENE OF SALEM'S MURDERS. WELL, WHY? I MEAN, HE COULD JUST BE A DARN GOOD TRACKER, LIKE ME. [Sighs] WELL, WHAT IF IT'S MORE THAN THAT? WHAT IF RYKER IS WORKING FOR SALEM? [Laughs] YOU'RE GETTING INTO SOME PRETTY HEAVY GUESSING FOR ONE LITTLE LAWYER. I MEAN, SHOULDN'T YOU BE SHARING SOME OF THIS WITH THE C.I.A.? I AM NOT A LITTLE LAWYER. I'M A LIEUTENANT COMMANDER IN CHARGE OF MY OWN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT. NO. KID, DID YOU HEAR THAT? SHE'S BEEN LYING TO US ALL THE TIME. BOY, IF YOU CAN'T TRUST YOUR OWN ARMED FORCES, WHO CAN YOU TRUST? DON'T START ON ME. I WANNA HEAR YOUR SIDE OF THE BARGAIN. - WHAT DID RYKER TELL YOU, AND WHERE IS HE? - NOPE. - ARE YOU GONNA BACK OUT ON YOUR WORD? - NO, I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY. IN FACT, THE WAY I SEE IT, HOWIE AND ME OWE YOU ONE LIE, SO NOW WE'RE EVEN. - COME ON, KID. WE'RE LEAVIN'. - LEAVING? THIS CAR'S GOING 40 MILES AN HOUR. [Colt] HOLD IT NICE AND STEADY, FELLAS. TAXI! THEY'RE OUT OF THEIR MINDS! THERE'S AN EXTRA 20 FOR YOU IF YOU CAN MAKE THIS NEXT LEFT. [Tires Squealing] TURN AROUND! CHANG! CHANG? CHANG. CHANG, WHAT HAPPENED? SUNDAY, FROM THE SKY. WHO? PRESIDENT MINARDOS... FROM THE SK-SKY. CHANG, WHERE DID THIS HAPPEN? HOW DID YOU GET AWAY? RYKER, IT'S ME, SEAVERS. - WERE YOU FOLLOWED? - NOT THAT WE COULD TELL. WE GOTTA TALK, SEAVERS. THERE'S NOT MUCH TIME. SALEM'S HERE, AND I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN STOP HIM... UNLESS YOUR COMMANDER CARLSON GETS IN MY WAY. GO AFTER THEM. THEY'LL LEAD YOU TO SALEM. IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE. STAY HERE, SEE IF YOU CAN HELP HIM. I'LL GO GET THE OTHER ONE. IF WE GET SEPARATED, I'LL MEET YOU AT THE TEMPLE OF THE RISING SUN. UH, WHERE? THE RISING SUN. WHOA!
