I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN HIM, BUT YOU NEVER KNEW WHO HE WAS. YOU'VE CHEERED FOR HIM AND CRIED FOR HIM, WOMEN HAVE WANTED TO DIE FOR HIM. BUT DID HE EVER GET ANY CREDIT? OR THE GIRL? NO. HE WAS WHAT WE CALL A STUNTMAN. AND THE REASON I'M TALKIN' SO FONDLY ABOUT HIM IS... WELL, BECAUSE IT'S ME, COLT SEAVERS. ANYWAY, PICTURE WORK ISN'T WALL-TO-WALL EMPLOYMENT. SO MAYBE YOU WONDER HOW A GUY KEEPS HIS HEAD TOGETHER. WELL, ONE WAY IS TO WAIT BY THE PHONE... AND WAIT... AND WAIT. THE OTHER IS TO TAKE AN OCCASIONAL JOB FOR THE COURT SYSTEM... OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHERE A MAN IS CONSIDERED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE... GET OUT OF JAIL ON WHAT WE CALL BAIL. AND THEY RUN LIKE HELL. THAT'S WHERE I COME IN. I SOMETIMES PICK UP RENT MONEY TRYIN' TO FIND THEM... AND BRING THEM BACK TO JUSTICE. BUT, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU CAN GET INTO SOMETHING... THAT'S WAY OVER A STUNTMAN'S HEAD. I'VE GOT YOU, SALEM. [Siren Blares] HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, PAL. AND DROP IT. NICE AND STILL, OR I'LL CUT YOU IN HALF. I'LL PAY THE $5,000 PREMIUM NOW... IF WE CAN ARRANGE FOR MY SECURITY. WE HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS IN MY BUSINESS, MR. RYKER. AND UNTIL I HAVE THAT SECURITY, I'LL HAVE TO PUT A MAN ON YOU AND CHARGE YOU FOR IT. A MAN? HE'S A PERFECT GENTLEMAN. HE STOLE MY TRUCK? ALL I HAD TO DO WAS STAY WITH THIS GUY A FEW HOURS FOR 500 BUCKS. AND HE ALSO STOLE THE DOSSIER WITH HIS PICTURE. AND HE WAS OUT ON A $50,000 BOND. COLT, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HE WENT? WIRE A DESCRIPTION OF THIS RYKER FELLA... - TO THE HONOLULU POLICE DEPARTMENT. - HONOLULU? - PUT THESE TWO UNDER ARREST. - WHAT? COLT, DO SOMETHING. DON'T GET EXCITED, KID. THIS HAS GOTTA BE SOME KIND OF A JOKE. ISN'T IT? WELL, IT'S ALL JUST A BIG MISTAKE. IF THEY'D LET US CALL BIG JACK... COLT, SOMEONE DOESN'T WANT YOU TALKING TO ANYBODY. TECHNICALLY, UNDER THIS KIND OF SECURITY BLACKOUT, - THEY COULD HOLD YOU INCOMMUNICADO FOR MONTHS. - MONTHS? MONTHS? NOW, I COULD INTERVENE FOR YOU, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO COOPERATE WITH ME. ANYTHING. WELL, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, AGENT BRADSHAW? COLT SEAVERS. YOU'RE HOLDING HIM UNDER FEDERAL WARRANT, AND I WANT HIM. WELL, YOU'RE TOO LATE. TOO LATE? SEAVERS JUST WENT OUT THE DOOR. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HELD HERE INCOMMUNICADO. SOMEBODY PULLED RANK, LIKE YOU. RYKER, WHERE ARE YOU? WHEN ARE YOU GONNA WORK THROUGH CHANNELS? I DON'T TRUST YOUR CHANNELS. SALEM CAN BUY THEM. AND WE CAN'T TRUST YOU TO RUN AROUND THE WORLD LIKE A ONE-MAN ARMY. SALEM'S HERE. DON'T GET IN MY WAY. WE KNOW YOU'RE IN HONOLULU, SO DON'T TRY TO DO ANYTHING BY YOURSELF. I'M GONNA STOP SALEM BEFORE HE KILLS AGAIN, AND BEFORE HE CAN STOP ME. THEY SPEND YEARS TRAINING THIS ANIMAL TO TRACK ME DOWN. AND I CANNOT FIND HIM. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO HE IS. SALEM'S HERE, AND I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN STOP HIM, UNLESS YOUR COMMANDER CARLSON GETS IN MY WAY. GO AFTER THEM. THEY'LL LEAD YOU TO SALEM. IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE. STAY HERE AND SEE IF YOU CAN HELP HIM. I'LL GO GET THE OTHER ONE. IF WE GET SEPARATED, I'LL MEET YOU AT THE TEMPLE OF THE RISING SUN. WHOA! - WHO ARE THOSE GUYS? - THEY WORK FOR SALEM. GOT TO STOP HIM. STOP HIM FROM DOING WHAT? WHY IS HE HERE? - MINARDOS. - THE PRESIDENT OF SAN SAMOA? - THEY'RE GOING TO KILL HIM. - WHAT? [Screams] [Man Announcing] AND NOW PART TWO OF "LICENSE TO KILL." IT'S HONOLULU POLICE JURISDICTION, PURE AND SIMPLE. NO. THERE'S NOTHING SIMPLE ABOUT THOSE BODIES, LIEUTENANT. TWO OF 'EM ARE KNOWN GUNSELS OF SALEM. THE OTHER ONE'S A UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AGENT. WHO HAPPENED TO BE WORKING FOR A MAN NAMED RYKER. WHO COLT SEAVERS WAS HUNTING DOWN LIKE AN ANIMAL. IF THAT IS TRUE, THEN IT PUTS THIS MATTER RIGHT BACK IN MY JURISDICTION. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THE MILITARY FEELS, BUT WE IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT DON'T LIKE BOUNTY HUNTERS... WHO SET THEMSELVES UP AS PROFESSIONAL HANGMEN. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, GENTLEMEN. I THINK IT'S PRETTY SILLY, OUR STANDING HERE FIGHTING OVER... WHO'S GONNA HANG COLT SEAVERS, WHEN NONE OF US HAVE HIM IN CUSTODY. SOMETHING I INTEND TO REMEDY. [Siren Wailing] [Howie] COLT. WHAT HAPPENED ON THE BOAT? RYKER'S ALIVE. I GOT HIM HERE, BUT HE'S IN BAD SHAPE. COME ON. RYKER. RYKER, CAN YOU HEAR ME? IT'S ME, SEAVERS. LET ME HAVE A LOOK. FORGET IT. WHO WERE THOSE GUYS? THEY WORK FOR SALEM. [Colt] I'M FAST BECOMING AN EXPERT ON SALEM. HE'S HERE. I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN STOP HIM... WAS. - MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE TO STOP HIM NOW. - ME? LOOK, I'M A STUNTMAN. I MAKE MOVIES. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CATCHING TERRORISTS. THEY SAY YOU CAN TRACK ALMOST ANYBODY. SALEM'S GOOD, BUT HE'S HUMAN. WE GOTTA GET YOU TO A HOSPITAL, AND WE GOTTA GET SOME HELP. NO. DON'T TELL ANYONE. THAT'S HOW HE KEEPS SLIPPING AWAY. HE CAN BUY ANYBODY. ANYBODY. HE'S GOT HELP... AN INFORMER. YOU'VE GOT TO STOP HIM BY YOURSELF. STOP HIM FROM DOING WHAT? WHY IS HE HERE? HIS TARGET IS MINARDOS. THE PRESIDENT OF SAN SAMOA? HOW? FROM THE SKY. I DON'T KNOW HOW. YOU GOTTA WARN HIM. RYKER, I CAN'T GET TO THE PRESIDENT OF A COUNTRY WITHOUT HELP. I NEED A CONTACT. NOW, YOU MUST TRUST SOMEBODY. YEAH. TRUSTED TWO. CHANG IS DEAD. THE OTHER IS BRADSHAW. HE GOT ME TO SALEM IN L.A. ALMOST HAD HIM. HE TIPPED ME THAT SALEM MIGHT BE COMING HERE. HOW DOES BRADSHAW KNOW SALEM'S WHEREABOUTS? MAYBE HE'S THE ONE THAT KEEPS SETTING YOU UP. NO. THE LEAK IS CARLSON. BRADSHAW SHARED INFORMATION WITH HER. EVERY TIME HE DID, WE'D LOSE SOMEONE. I'LL GET TO BRADSHAW. SEAVERS, CATCH SALEM... AND STOP HIM. I'LL TRY. I'LL TRY. I'LL SURELY TRY. KID, YOU STAY WITH HIM. BRADSHAW WILL KNOW HOW TO GET US A DOCTOR. RIGHT. COLT, HOW DID WE GET MIXED UP IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS? YOU LOST MY TRUCK. RYKER IS STILL ALIVE. FIND HIM. ONCE HE'S DEAD, NO ONE CAN STOP ME. MINARDOS LANDS TOMORROW AT NOON, AND TONIGHT I WILL COMPLETE THE PREPARATIONS FOR HIS WELCOME. PRESIDENT MINARDOS OF SAN SAMOA ARRIVES IN HONOLULU TOMORROW... FOR CONTINUED TALKS WITH UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE JACKSON. ACCOMPANYING HIM ARE HIS LOVELY WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN. [Phone Rings] A MYSTERIOUS SPEEDBOAT EXPLOSION EARLIER TODAY IN MERCHANT HARBOR LEFT ONE MAN DEAD. - YEAH. - WE HAVE A MUTUAL FRIEND. - WHO IS THIS? - YOU DON'T KNOW ME, BUT I WAS WITH RYKER WHEN THEY HIT HIM. - YOU LED THEM TO HIM. - WOULD I BE CALLING YOU IF I DID? - HE WOULDN'T GIVE YOU MY NAME. - WELL, HE HAD TO. HE HAD NO ONE ELSE TO TURN TO. HE WAS DESPERATE TO GET INFORMATION TO YOU. WHAT IS IT? - WELL, I'D PREFER TO MEET YOU FACE TO FACE. - WHO ARE YOU? COLT SEAVERS. BUT LIKE I SAID, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ME. [Reporter] THE ASSAILANT IS BELIEVED TO BE COLT SEAVERS, WHO'S ALREADY WANTED... BY THE HONOLULU POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR JUMPING BAIL. AN ALL-POINTS BULLETIN HAS BEEN ISSUED, AND POLICE LIEUTENANT FONG WARNS ANYONE SEEING THIS MAN, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO APPREHEND. HE IS BELIEVED TO BE ARMED AND CONSIDERED EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. NOW A LOOK AT THE LOCAL WEATHER FORECAST. WE'D BETTER MEET. BRADSHAW? YEAH. LET'S TAKE A WALK. DON'T STOP. KEEP WALKING. WHERE IS HE AND HOW IS HE? HE'S HURT BAD. HE NEEDS A DOCTOR. I CAN HANDLE THAT. LET'S GET TO HIM. THERE'S MORE. THERE'S SOMETHING HE WANTS YOU TO DO FIRST. WHAT? STOP A MURDER. HE KNOW SALEM'S TARGET? YES. WHO? PRESIDENT MINARDOS. MINARDOS? NO. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THAT WAS THE MESSAGE. THAT FOOL. HE WALKED INTO A TRAP FOR NOTHING. THEY KNEW HE'D TAKE THAT KIND OF BAIT. WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE HE ISN'T RIGHT? BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN KILL HIM. HE'S GOT THE BEST SECURITY FORCE IN THE FREE WORLD. HE SAID IT WOULD HAPPEN FROM THE AIR. NO, AN AIR ATTACK ON MINARDOS IS IMPOSSIBLE. THIS IS AN ISLAND. YOU KNOW, ALL THE AIR TRAFFIC'S VERY CAREFULLY MONITORED. WHAT ABOUT FROM THE TOP OF A BUILDING? NO. WE USE POLICE HELICOPTER COVER. THEN EVERYTHING'S ROUTED AND REROUTED AGAIN. EVEN THE POLICE DON'T KNOW THE FINAL TRAFFIC PATTERN. NO. I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. [Bradshaw] YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT. ONE OF THOSE THINGS COULD GET IN LOWER THAN A HELICOPTER. BUT IT'S ALL DOWNHILL FROM THERE, AND SALEM ISN'T INTO KAMIKAZE. HE WALKS AWAY FROM HIS MURDERS. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT YOUR CAREER ON THE LINE AND WARN MINARDOS. JUST ON YOUR SAY-SO? HE'LL THINK I'M A LUNATIC. YOUR FRIEND PUT HIS LIFE ON THE LINE TO GET YOU THIS INFORMATION. - BE A SHAME IF HE DIED FOR NOTHIN'. - WE'RE NOT GONNA LET HIM DIE. - WHERE IS HE? - I CAN TAKE YOU. [Buzzes] BRADSHAW HERE. I WANT A COMPANY MEDICAL TEAM... AT THE TEMPLE OF THE RISING SUN ON THE DOUBLE. PUT A LID ON IT. RIGHT. I'LL MEET YOU THERE. TEMPLE OF THE RISING SUN. [Howie] WHERE'S THE DOCTOR? HE'S BURNING UP. [Colt] HE'S ON THE WAY. I'LL TAKE OVER. HERE. TAKE MY CAR AND HEAD FOR THE AIRPORT. THERE'LL BE PREPAID TICKETS ON THE FIRST FLIGHT BACK TO L.A. WAIT. I KNOW YOU GOT CLOUT, BUT THERE'S A WARRANT OUT FOR US IN THIS TOWN. IT'LL BE TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE YOU GET TO THE AIRPORT. THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET YOU OUT BEFORE THEY GRILL YOU. WHAT'S WRONG WITH TELLING THE POLICE THE TRUTH? I MEAN, THE MORE PEOPLE THAT KNOW THAT SALEM'S AFTER MINARDOS, - THE BETTER THE CHANCE HE WON'T BE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF. - NO. WE WANT SALEM BAD, AND THIS IS OUR BEST CHANCE. - THEN YOU'LL SET UP A TRAP? - EXACTLY. BUT IT WON'T WORK IF OUR INTERNAL LEAK TELLS SALEM WE KNOW WHO HIS TARGET IS. ALL RIGHT. I GUESS YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOIN'. BELIEVE ME. YOU'VE LEFT HIM IN GOOD HANDS. ALL RIGHT, KID. LET'S GET WHILE THE GETTING'S GOOD. RYKER, YOU LOSE. [Gunshot] SEAVERS AND MUNSON ARE HEADED FOR THE AIRPORT IN MY CAR. NOW, THEY WON'T BE GETTING ANY SPEEDING TICKETS, SO YOU CAN OVERTAKE 'EM EASY. NOW, PLANT THIS GUN ON SEAVERS AFTER YOU KILL THEM BOTH. [Howie] YOU OUGHTA FEEL PRETTY PROUD, COLT. YEAH? WHY? WELL, HOW OFTEN IS IT THAT A HOLLYWOOD STUNTMAN... GETS TO GO INTO ACTION ALONGSIDE THE F.B.I. AND NAVAL INTELLIGENCE... AND COME OUT SAVING THE DAY FOR BOTH OF THEM? HMM. WHAT'S THE MATTER? UH, BONNIE. YOU HAD QUITE A THING WITH HER, DIDN'T YOU? NO. I THINK I JUST LOVED HER. PEOPLE CHANGE, COLT. YEAH, BUT WHY? WHY WOULD SHE... WHY WOULD ANYONE HELP A TERRORIST? WELL, IF IT'S NOT POLITICAL, I CAN THINK OF ONLY ONE OLD-FASHIONED REASON. SALEM AND BONNIE? COLT, WOMEN PICK SOME REAL LOSERS WHEN THEY'RE IN LOVE, AND BONNIE IS NO EXCEPTION. WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN YOU. I MEANT SALEM. HEY, WATCH OUT! WHAT IS IT? IT'S A BOMB! WELL, THROW IT OUT! IT'S A GUN. WHY'D THEY GIVE US A GUN? MAYBE THEY WANTED TO MAKE IT A FAIR FIGHT. [Screaming] [Siren Wailing] - UH-OH. - I WOULDN'T GO WAVIN' THAT GUN AROUND. IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN. [Siren Stops] YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENED, FELLAS. BOOK 'EM. CHARGE? - SUSPICION OF MURDER. - MURDER? WE DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY. NO? WE CAN PUT YOU AT THE SCENE OF BOTH A BOAT AND A CAR BLOWING UP. A SUNDAY DRIVE AND A LITTLE WATERSKIING. YEAH! BEFORE YOU GET GOING TOO FAR HERE, LIEUTENANT, UH, WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WE'D LIKE TO ASK MR. SEAVERS... REGARDING THE WHEREABOUTS OF CHARLES RYKER. WELL, AS IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME, UH, OFFICIALLY, CHARLES RYKER DOES NOT NOW OR NEVER DID EXIST. HUH. AND JUST WHERE DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT LOAD OF MALARKEY? FROM YOU GUYS. YOU PAID MR. SEAVERS'S BONDING AGENCY $50,000... TO PERMANENTLY REMOVE ANY RECORD OF HIM. WELL, THAT WAS YESTERDAY. TODAY WE WANNA KNOW WHERE HE IS. SORRY. SEAVERS AND MUNSON ARE OFFICIALLY UNDER UNITED STATES NAVY CUSTODY. - [Colt] OH, NOW WAIT A MINUTE. - TAKE 'EM AWAY, BOYS. YOU CAN'T LET 'EM TAKE US. WE'RE YOUR PRISONERS. IF BALLISTICS TURNS UP ANYTHING ON THE GUN WE FOUND ON 'EM, I'M COMING AFTER THEM, COMMANDER. WHEN YOU HAVE A CHARGE THAT TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER MINE, YOU CAN HAVE THEM. UH, JUST WHAT IS YOUR CHARGE? TREASON. [Bonnie] YOU TRAITORS. I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS, COLT. YEAH, SO DID I. I'M NOT SURE I EVEN KNOW YOU. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? NOTHING. DON'T GIVE ME THAT. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO. WELL, I'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU, BONNIE. I'M SORRY. WE HAVE TO TALK. I SAID WE HAVE TO TALK. YOUR MEN BLEW IT. THEY PLANTED THE GUN ON SEAVERS AND THE KID, BUT THEY DIDN'T KILL 'EM. IT ISN'T IMPORTANT. IT IS IMPORTANT. BALLISTICS IS GONNA TIE THAT GUN IN TO RYKER'S DEATH, AND SOONER OR LATER, SOMEBODY'S GONNA FIGURE OUT THAT I DIDN'T DO WHAT I PROMISED. STRANGE. ULTIMATELY, I SEEM TO ALWAYS HAVE TO HANDLE THINGS MYSELF, DON'T I? I GOT RYKER. YEAH. YES, BUT, YOU SEE, UNLESS SEAVERS AND MUNSON ARE SILENCED, YOU'RE A DEAD MAN. WELL, UH, MAYBE I CAN HANDLE IT MYSELF. YOU'LL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO TONIGHT. YOU HAVE UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING. YOU SEE, AFTER THAT, I... I WON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE. I CAN HANDLE IT. GOOD, I CERTAINLY HOPE SO. YOU'VE BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME, AND I'D HATE TO THINK OF, UH, BUYING SOMEONE NEW. UH-UH. THE NOSE ISN'T RIGHT. THAT'S HIM. YEAH, THAT'S RYKER. PUT IT THROUGH. LET'S SEE WHAT IT GETS US. [Phone Rings] BY THE TIME THEY FIGURE OUT THEY'VE BEEN HAD, BRADSHAW SHOULD HAVE RYKER SAFELY TUCKED AWAY. [Bonnie] COMMANDER CARLSON. GO AHEAD. HOPEFULLY THEN THEY'LL GO... HANDLE THIS MINARDOS THING, AND WE CAN GO HOME. FOR A COUPLE OF GREENHORNS, WE'VE HANDLED THIS SPY BUSINESS PRETTY DARN GOOD. WELL, I GUESS THAT WIPES OUT ANY LEAD WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO SALEM. EXCEPT FOR THOSE TWO CHARACTERS THAT YOU TOOK WITH YOU... UM, SEAVERS AND MUNSON. - ARE THEY STILL WITH YOU? - FOR THE DURATION. I WONDER IF I COULD ARRANGE TO QUESTION THEM A LITTLE MORE. A LITTLE MORE? WHEN DID YOU TALK TO THEM? I MEAN, A LITTLE MORE THAN I READ IN THE POLICE REPORT. BRADSHAW, YOU'LL GET THEM WHEN I'M THROUGH WITH THEM. THEY STILL KNOW MORE THAN THEY'RE TELLING ME. I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS. YOU CAN SCRAP RYKER'S PICTURE. HE'S DEAD. HE DIED? YOU LOOK SO SURPRISED AND INNOCENT. COLT SEAVERS, INNOCENT. THAT'LL BE THE DAY. HOW DID IT HAPPEN? WHERE DID HE TURN UP? THAT'S CLASSIFIED. DAMN IT, BONNIE, SOME THINGS HAVE TO STOP BEING CLASSIFIED. OKAY, THEN YOU TELL ME THIS. WHEN DID YOU SEE RYKER LAST AND WHERE? - MUNSON? - WE CAN'T TELL YOU THAT. YOU'RE GONNA KEEP PLAYING IT THAT WAY? WE KIND OF GAVE OUR WORD. WHO DID YOU GIVE IT TO? SALEM? OH, THAT WASN'T NICE. RYKER IS DEAD. WHO ELSE DO YOU HAVE TO TRUST MORE THAN ME? [Howie] I ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE PEARL HARBOR. ISN'T THIS GREAT, COLT? I GOT THE FEELING IT'S GONNA LOOK A LOT LIKE JAIL. IT'S THE ONLY PLACE I KNOW WHERE I CAN KEEP THE TWO OF YOU OUT OF TROUBLE. THIS WILL BE YOUR HOME UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. WELL, BONNIE, YOU COULD AT LEAST TELL US WHERE THEY FOUND HIM. IN A JAPANESE TEMPLE. A GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE HEAD KILLED HIM, ALTHOUGH HE DID HAVE OTHER WOUNDS. APPARENTLY HE WAS INVOLVED IN QUITE A SHOOT-OUT. I'M SURE THAT COMES AS QUITE A SHOCK TO YOU. OH, INCIDENTALLY, THIS IS A MILITARY BASE. THE GUARDS ARE AUTHORIZED TO SHOOT ANYONE WHO IS CAUGHT IN AN UNAUTHORIZED AREA. FOR YOU TWO, THAT'S ANYWHERE OUTSIDE THIS ROOM. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? WELL, RYKER WAS BADLY HURT. MAYBE THEY COULDN'T SAVE HIM. THEN WHY WAS HE STILL IN THE TEMPLE? AND HOW DID HE DIE OF A HEAD WOUND? HE DIDN'T HAVE A HEAD WOUND. - YOU'RE SURE? - YEAH. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. IF WE COULD JUST TALK TO BRADSHAW. WE CAN'T GET TO ANYBODY. HE MUST KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. RYKER SAID HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WE COULD TRUST. WE CAN'T GO BACK ON OUR WORD UNTIL WE MANAGE TO FIND A WAY TO GET TO HIM. THESE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF PRESIDENT MINARDOS. [Whining] WHAT IS IT, BOY? [Whining] WHAT'S THE MATTER, RIP? WHOA! A GRENADE! RIP, COME ON, BABY! COME ON! [Colt] YOU KNOW, KID? [Howie] HMM? RYKER SAID THAT BRADSHAW TIPPED HIM TO SALEM'S WHEREABOUTS. SO? WELL, SO WHY ONLY TIP RYKER? WHY NOT TIP HIS OWN SQUAD? WELL, YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID. NO ONE TRUSTS THEIR OWN SQUAD BECAUSE OF THE LEAKS. YOU KNOW, BRADSHAW AND RYKER DRIFTED TOGETHER OUT OF MUTUAL SURVIVAL. YEAH, BUT BRADSHAW TRUSTED HIS OWN SQUAD TO PHONE 'EM... IN FRONT OF ME TO ORDER THAT MEDICAL TEAM. EVEN IF HE WERE DEAD WHEN THEY GOT THERE, THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM. COLT, IF BRADSHAW TURNS OUT TO BE THE LEAK... THEN WE'VE PUT EVERYONE'S LIVES IN HIS HANDS... MINARDOS'S, BONNIE'S... - OURS. - AND RYKER'S. WE'RE GETTIN' OUT OF HERE, KID. WE'VE JUST GOTTA FIND A WAY. LET ME REMIND YOU, COLT, THAT WE'RE UNDER GUARD. WE DON'T EXACTLY BLEND IN AROUND HERE. HEY, LOOK. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK THE SKIRT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE SHORT. SKIRT? OH, THAT'S JUST OUR LUCK. SHE PUT US UP IN THE WOMEN'S B.O.Q. THAT TAKES CARE OF THAT. WHY? WHAT'S THE LAST THING THOSE TWO GOONS DOWN THE HALL ARE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR? AW, KID, NO. I THINK HE LIKED YOU. YOO-HOO! TAXI! [With Effeminate Voice] EXCUSE ME. COULD YOU TAKE US TO WAIKIKI, PLEASE? GET IN. [Howie] YOU KNOW, COLT, YOU REALLY DON'T LOOK HALF BAD. YOU LOOK TERRIBLE. ANYWAY, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? WE CAN'T EXACTLY GO RUNNING UP TO PRESIDENT MINARDOS TO WARN HIM IN THESE OUTFITS. [Colt] WE GO BACK TO THE HOTEL AND CHANGE. [Howie] AND THEN WHAT? WELL, THEN WE... I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND YOU TRY ANYTHING UNTIL I COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. [Tires Squealing] AAAH! FIND THEM! OW! COLT, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE WE ARE? NO. I THOUGHT YOU KNEW THESE ISLANDS. YEAH, SO DID I. YOU KNOW, I ONCE TOOK A COURSE IN NAVIGATION. OH, YEAH? WELL, WHERE ARE WE? WE'RE LOST. GOOD, KID. LET'S HOPE THOSE CLOWNS ARE TOO. [Grunts] HOW DO WOMEN WALK IN THINGS LIKE THIS? VERY CAREFULLY. THIS WAY. WHICH WAY DID THEY GO? THAT WAY. OH, OW. OUCH, OOH, OH, OW! OH, NO. WHAT IS IT? THE GUYS THAT ARE AFTER US? NO, IT'S WORSE. WHAT COULD BE WORSE? I COULD BE RUINED. ♪♪ [Whistling] COLT? COLT SEAVERS, IS THAT YOU? HI, TOM. - UH, HOW'S MAGNUM GOIN'? - WELL. IT'S GOIN' REAL WELL. UH, IT MUST BE A GREAT PLACE TO WORK OVER HERE. - I SURE WOULD LIKE TO COME OVER AND DO SOME STUNTS FOR YOU. - OH, YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT. UH, COLT, YOU ALL RIGHT? OH, UH, COULDN'T BE BETTER. UH, THIS IS MY, UH... UH, MY COUSIN, UH, HOWIE, UH, MUNSON. - A GREAT GUY. - YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT. UH, HOWIE, UH, TOM SELLECK. HI. UH, COLT, I MEAN, THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT LET ME ASK YOU. HAS YOUR LIFE TAKEN SOME KIND OF PECULIAR TURN SINCE WE WORKED TOGETHER? TURN? UH... DIDN'T MEAN TO PRY, COLT. IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS. [Chuckles] OH, YOU MEAN THE DRESSES. NO, NO, NO. UH, LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, TOM. I MEAN... HEY, IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS. LOOK, IF I TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHAT HOWIE AND I... ARE MIXED UP IN, IT'S SO BIZARRE YOU'D NEVER BELIEVE IT. LOOK, WE CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW. WE GOT SOME GUYS CHASIN' US. YEAH. I DIDN'T MEAN TO PRY, COLT. - UH... - UH, COLT, UM, LOOK. IF YOU EVER GET YOUR LIFE STRAIGHTENED OUT, YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS GOT A JOB WITH US. UH, YEAH, WELL, THANKS, TOM. BOY, THERE GOES A GREAT GUY... GIRL... WHATEVER. HOW CAN THEY BE GONE? YOU WERE STANDING GUARD. THE WINDOWS ARE BARRED. WELL, I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED. THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WENT OUT OF HERE WERE A COUPLE OF OFFICERS. WHAT OFFICERS? TWO WOMEN. THEN YOU MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP, WHICH, AS YOU KNOW, IS A SHOOTING OFFENSE. DID YOU SAY TWO WOMEN? [Bonnie] IT'S COMMANDER CARLSON. PATCH ME THROUGH TO LIEUTENANT FONG. YES. COMMANDER? I WAS JUST GONNA CALL YOU. YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT THE GUN WE FOUND ON SEAVERS WAS THE GUN THAT KILLED RYKER. DID YOU HEAR ME? YES, I HEARD YOU, LIEUTENANT. I GUESS I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY. MAYBE I CAN MAKE UP FOR IT. WELL, YOU BETTER MAKE IT FAST. WE'RE SWAMPED. I WANT YOU TO PUT OUT AN A.P.B. ON TWO FEMALE IMPERSONATORS. COMMANDER, I AM RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BIGGEST SECURITY BLANKET WE HAVE EVER HAD. IT'S FOR YOUR TWO FAVORITES, LIEUTENANT... MUNSON AND SEAVERS. THEY'VE ESCAPED IN STOLEN UNIFORMS... WOMEN'S. WE'RE TAKIN' A BIG CHANCE COMIN' BACK HERE, COLT. I DON'T CARE. I AIN'T WALKIN' IN THESE HEELS ANOTHER BLOCK. ROOM 314, PLEASE. UH, THAT'S MR. SEAVERS'S ROOM. I AM MR. SEAVERS. MASQUERADE PARTY. DON'T DRIP ON MY LOBBY. SO, WHAT'S OUR FIRST MOVE THEN, COLT? TO TEST BRADSHAW AND BONNIE. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHO'S SELLIN' OUT WHO. WHOM. WHAT? WHO'S SELLIN' OUT WHOM. I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT, KID. WE AIN'T GOT MUCH TIME. THE PRESIDENT THAT SALEM'S FIXIN' TO KILL LANDS AT NOON. A MAJOR MILITARY INSTALLATION BREAK-IN FOLLOWED WITHIN DAYS... BY AN ACT OF TERRORISM OR ASSASSINATION UTILIZING THE STOLEN WEAPONS. COMMANDER, I CAN'T EXPLAIN BREAK-INS ON OTHER BASES, BUT I CAN TESTIFY THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE... FOR ANYONE TO BREAK INTO THIS PRECISE BUNKER AND TAKE THOSE PRECIOUS WEAPONS... WITHOUT PRECISE INSIDE INFORMATION. WHO SAYS THAT SALEM DOESN'T HAVE INSIDE INFORMATION? SALEM? YOU THINK SALEM IS HERE? MM-HMM. IN HONOLULU? WHY? I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE'S PLANNING TO LET US KNOW, USING YOUR EXPLOSIVES. WELL, SHE'S ALL FUELED UP AND READY TO GO, MR. HUNTER. THANK YOU. THE WORLD'S FULL OF NUTS. YEAH, AND WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON TWO OF 'EM... [Salem] DIRECT HIT. [Fong] THE MOTORCADE WILL BE COMPLETELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE C.I.A., WITH ARMED PERSONNEL HERE, HERE AND HERE. [Rings] HEADQUARTERS. ONE MOMENT. COMMANDER CARLSON, IT'S FOR YOU. LINE TWO. PRESIDENT MINARDOS WILL BE IN THE FIRST LIMOUSINE, HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN IN THE SECOND. NOW, THE MOTORCADE WILL PROCEED... FROM THE HONOLULU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT... COMMANDER CARLSON. - COLT, WHERE ARE YOU? - [Colt] I NEED TO SEE YOU ALONE. YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME. [Bonnie] UH, YES, OF COURSE. WHERE? KIONA AND ALA WAI IN 15 MINUTES. PHONE BOOTH ON THE CORNER. AND DON'T BRING ANYONE. - COLT, WHAT IS IT? - IT'S A CONSPIRACY TO KILL MINARDOS. TO KILL MINARDOS? FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOU MUST BE DELIRIOUS. YEAH, WELL, I KNOW WHO, AND I KNOW HOW. NOW GET HERE AS FAST AS YOU CAN. NOW WHAT? WELL, IF SHE COMES ALONE, WE CAN TRUST HER. WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHICH WAY IT COMES OUT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WELL, I CAN ONLY THINK OF ONE CRAZY WAY THAT SALEM MIGHT ATTACK MINARDOS FROM THE SKY... AND LIVE TO GET AWAY WITH HIS OWN SKIN. IT'S NUTS, BUT IT'S POSSIBLE. HOW DO I GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU? WELL, IF BONNIE'S OKAY, I'LL REACH YOU BACK HERE AT THE BOOTH. IF NOT, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. THOSE RIDING WITH... [Continues, Indistinct] OH! CLAY, YOU STARTLED ME. IS SOMETHING WRONG, COMMANDER? NO, NO, NOTHING'S WRONG. I'M JUST UPSET ABOUT THIS SEAVERS THING. HAS THE AGENCY PICKED UP ANYTHING ON HIS WHEREABOUTS? NO, AND HE'S A WALKING CORPSE IF HE DOESN'T GIVE HIMSELF UP. LISTEN, I WANT YOU TO WORK CLOSELY WITH US ON THIS, EVEN THOUGH YOU DO KNOW HIM PERSONALLY. SURE. EXCUSE ME. NOW IT'S BEEN CONFIRMED THAT PRESIDENT MINARDOS WILL BE LANDING IN THREE HOURS. I WILL BE COORDINATING THE OPERATION BY RADIO COMMUNICATION... WITH BOTH ROSE GARDEN AND SKYWATCH. [Dialing] NOW, ANY CHANGE OF PLANS MUST COME DIRECTLY FROM ME. BRADSHAW. IS THAT CLEAR? I'VE LOCATED SEAVERS. KIONA AND ALA WAI. [Tires Screech] HEY! LET ME GO! THAT'S NOT HIM, YOU IDIOTS! LET HIM GO! TAKE HER. COLT SEAVERS? RIGHT. HEY, I'M REALLY A FAN OF YOUR WORK IN THE MOVIES. YOU REALLY WANT TO USE ONE OF MY BIRDS IN YOUR FLICK, HUH? YEAH. IN FACT, WE MAY NEED MORE THAN ONE. HOW MANY OF 'EM ARE THERE ON THE ISLANDS? OH, THERE'S ONLY THREE, BUT THEY'RE ALL RIGHT HERE ON OAHU. THE, UH, TWO I OWN AND ONE A STUDENT JUST HAD SHIPPED IN. ANYONE TRY TO BUY YOU OUT OR, UH, TIE UP EITHER ONE OF THESE BIRDS LATELY? NOTHING EXCEPT FOR OUR USUAL RENTAL BUSINESS. YOU KNOW, AN HOUR HERE, HOUR THERE. YOU HAVEN'T RUN INTO ANYBODY THAT WAS PARTICULARLY GUNG-HO THOUGH? NOBODY EXCEPT FOR THAT STUDENT I WAS TELLIN' YOU ABOUT. HE'S PROBABLY THE BEST I'VE EVER WORKED WITH. HE WAS IN HERE THIS MORNING. HE LOVES TO FLY RIGHT OFF THE DECK. IT'S A LITTLE RISKY, BUT HE'S KIND OF A WEIRD GUY. TALL? UH, DARK-HAIRED? KINDA LOOKS LIKE CHARLES BRONSON? WELL, YEAH. THAT'S HIM. YOU KNOW HIM? WHAT NAME DID HE USE? HUNTER. HUNTER. WHERE DID HE HAVE THE BIRD SHIPPED TO? HE HAD IT SHIPPED RIGHT HERE, BUT HE KEEPS IT IN A WAREHOUSE DOWN ON KING STREET. YOU GOT AN ADDRESS ON IT? WELL, I SHOULD HAVE IN THE OFFICE. COULD I TAKE A LOOK? WELL, SURE. UH, CAN I USE YOUR PHONE? YEAH. FOLLOW ME. [Rings] COLT? YEAH. WHAT'S THE VERDICT? THOSE GUYS IN BLACK... THE DEATH SQUAD? THEY SHOWED UP. WELL, THEN IT'S FOR SURE. BONNIE'S SOLD OUT TO SALEM. - NO. THEY GRABBED HER AND TOOK HER AWAY. - WELL, THEN SHE'S ON OUR SIDE. OKAY, KID. YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. GO GET BRADSHAW ANY WAY YOU CAN. YEAH. BRADSHAW...
