 Something happened to your brother while he was filming. He will pay. I promise. We hope that this will in some way help bring closure for Isaac. The Sequel. The producers want to recast Isaac's role. You had no right! That's my part, and you're taking it away from me?! He's not happy. All I'm trying to do is what's best for Isaac. You can't just make decisions about Isaac without talking to him first. He needs our support. I'll be damned if I let Isaac do another film!

 I don't want this any more. - Us. - Good. - What went down in America? - He forced me, bruv. You're gay, innit? We can't hang out no more, G. You let that man get away with it. But I won't. If this got out, it would destroy all of our lives, including yours. We got him, Isaac. I've exposed him to the world. Isaac, please open the door! What have you done?! What's your response to the allegations? Get out of my way! Afternoon. "Hollywood supremo Jotham Starr accused of child abuse." That wasn't us.

 We didn't go to the press. What about social media? There's numerous comments filling in the blank spaces with Isaac's name. - Coincidence? - You can't control what people say online. You know that. We require that your family releases a statement denying the claims in the article. If you don't, then we sue. We came to a financial agreement purely to protect our 100 million movie from damage. That agreement has now been violated. Do you even care about my son? Do you know what's happened? What he's done? Everything he's going through? Well. You and your client can go screw yourselves. Publish a denial, or we will sue. Good. Then everyone will know it's because you paid us off. You think the press haven't been briefed on who the Mensahs really are? A poor family led by ambitious parents who took advantage of the MeToo movement by using their child to extort millions from a humble film-maker. We'll just say you're lying. You'd be surprised how conservative the public are when it comes to stories like your own. Especially if some of the research we have about you both - is also released. - We've got nothing to hide. What, no infidelities? Everyone that matters knows about my past mistakes. I'm an open book. What about you, Mrs Mensah? You're pathetic. - Is that all? - Just think about what I said. If we have to, we will sue. Sam? Sam! Why did Brett ask you that question? Because he's trying to mess with our heads. What did he mean? Tell me. Did you cheat on me? Don't fucking walk away from me. Answer me! Sam? Answer me! Yeah, that's right, just drive away, yeah? Go on, drive away, then! Jess? Jess, sorry, it's just you haven't returned any of my calls. - Go away. - Jess, please, I just need one minute. Jotham's hired a publicist to work at discrediting Isaac's story. - Piss off! - They're calling your brother a liar. They saying your parents made up this story - to exploit Jotham for more money. - They didn't do that. Can you not just say? Jotham's team are currently suing me over the article. So I can't write anything further. - At least for a while. - Well. We expected him to retaliate in this way. It's a small price for telling the truth, but the strongest way forward now is to hear the truth from your parents' own mouths. There's a colleague of mine that works for a US newspaper. No! What? No! No more newspapers! No, no, no, this will be different. This will be recorded interview for the paper's website, but totally anonymous. Voices and faces disguised. That way, your parents can tell the full story... unfiltered. They'll never do it. Your parents do this interview, Jotham will be finished. Tyrone? What are you doing? You all right? Look at me. Look at me. What's wrong? - It's all my fault. - What is? Isaac. What do you mean by that? Ty, come on. I told him he was gay for what he did. Why did you say that? Why did you say that? Look at me. What Isaac did, taking those pills, didn't happen because of you. I promise. What happened to Isaac... wasn't his fault. Do you understand that? So what you need to do now... is you need to be there for him. OK? Cos he's your brother. Mum? Hey. - Let's go inside. - Yeah. - How's the new place? - It's getting there. How's Isaac? Itching to get out, but... he's doing all right. We're seeing him again tomorrow. Mum? Do you remember the journalist I went to, Dominic? He said that Jotham's hired a publicist to spread lies about you and Dad. What kind of lies? Saying that you're lying to get the money. Not surprised. But he's saying you can silence them. There's a guy he knows in America who's willing to do a video interview with you and Dad. I know, I... That's what I thought. He keeps going on about how it'd be anonymous and they'd blur out your faces. You didn't say I'd do it, did you? No, I just said I'd pass on the message. Do you want to come see Isaac with me? It'd cheer him up. Yeah. Yeah, OK. Um, I'm just... I'm just going to go for a quick cigarette. I'll give you five minutes with him. OK. You'll be pleased to hear he's doing really well. Now, I am happy for him to go home. But... this is where the real work begins. I'll need to visit him regularly in order to continue our sessions and monitor his progress. I understand. Isaac will be staying with me in our new place. - It'll be a fresh start. - OK. I'll get you those forms, so you can fill them in. Thanks. He already has a home. After all that's happened, do you really expect him to go back to that house? Hi. - Hi. - Are you coming in? Er... no, I'm just leaving, actually. OK... have a good day. Thanks. You, too. Why are you bringing that here? It'll stink up the place. - You said you wanted it? - No. I said I can wait until I get out. You never listen to me. Come in. It's just us. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. You all right? Maybe both of you should go outside and get some fresh air? Yeah? That's fine by me. Here, take your coat. Yeah, I'll come find you. Come on, then. How is he doing? Good. He should be coming home today. You feeling all right now? Yeah, I'm fine. Look, man... I'm sorry for what I said. And everything. - It wasn't your fault. - Fam, you tried to kill yourself. But that weren't cos of you, trust? G, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't have taken them pills. - I've been taking the pills for ages. - I still abandoned you, man. I should've been there for you, bruv. A lot went down since we last spoke. The newspaper... people finding out... I ain't been hearing no-one talking about you. How about online? G, I'm telling you this right now. No-one our age searches for that kind of stuff. And if they do, so what? Still, I bet people at my school know. If anyone wants to chat about, yeah? Just tell me. They don't want problems with me. And promise me one thing. What? Don't let that prick get away with it. - Brought you a tea. - Thank you. This must be the longest time we've ever spent in a room together. I mean, like, on our own, just the two of us. Really? After 14 years? No, there must've been at least one time. Not without Manny or the kids. Or Maggie. Well, we both know what they expect us to do when we're alone, so... shall we start with some old-fashioned hair-pulling, or... face-scratching, or... maybe a right hook first? I'm really grateful for your son. He's been such a good friend to Isaac. If you ever need help with Isaac, I'm here. My door's always open. Thank you. - See you later, yeah? - See ya. I need to have a word. I've been offered a chance to do an interview with a US newspaper. It's a recorded interview, it'll be posted online. Silly idea. Actually, I thought it might be positive. It's a chance to give my side of the story and make sure everyone knows that Isaac was telling the truth. - Is Isaac involved? - No. It'll just be me, but I'll be made anonymous. - I think it's a stupid idea. - What else do you suggest that we do? Because even if we give in to Brett's demands, we'll still have to talk to the papers, and I'm not having Jotham control what I say. Well, then, you do what you want to do, and I'll do what I want to do. I'm making a cup of tea. - Do you want one? - No. You can't keep torturing yourself. That producer robbed you of your marriage, and your son. And now, he's robbing you of your sanity. He hasn't robbed me of my sanity. Then what is the meaning of all of this? Either you deal with things once and for all, or you move on! My son... I love you. You can deal with this. You can deal with it. What do you think? It's nice, yeah. We'll go back to the old house tomorrow and pick up your stuff. But this is a new start. Things are going to get better, I promise. I know. I want us to be 100% honest with each other. No more hiding or burying things, and that includes me as much as you. I want to start by being open with you about an offer I've been given. It's to do an anonymous interview. About what happened to you in America. Don't worry. I haven't said yes. I wanted to talk to you first. I thought it might be an opportunity to... to fight back, while still protecting you. If you don't want me to do it, then I won't. I'll only do it with your blessing. OK. Hey, Manny? Yeah, it's about what you said in the meeting. You wanted us to go to the press and deny the newspaper's allegations. I'll do it. - Good man. - I have one request. I want to meet your boss. And to talk to him. So I can have closure. I know I can't change what's happened. I just want to be able to move on. I'll get back to you. All of mine and Isaac's stuff is in the van. Whatever we've left, you can have or sell, or... just chuck away. - Hey, let me help you with that. - I'm fine. Fine. I'm going to miss you. - I'm not leaving the country. - I know. Look, what... Whatever happens in the future... I just want you to... never forget that I love you. OK? - Thanks for doing this. - Don't mention it. - I'll be back in a few hours. - Yeah. OK, bye. Good luck. Come on, she'll be all right. After we finish the questions, I'll send a recording over to my colleague in the States, and he'll do the rest. It could be uploaded as early as tonight. You good? We'll be good to go in about a minute. So your son was filming for 12 weeks in Los Angeles. Were you or your husband on set during that time? No. We couldn't afford to take the time off from work. Plus we were reassured that our child would be looked after. - By who? - The chaperone. What made you trust her? Maybe because she was a woman, she felt like someone who cared. And she'd worked with lots of other child actors before. But, essentially, you left your child in the hands of strangers? Yeah. Can you tell us a little bit about your son? What was he like at that time? Was kind. Cheerful. Just a happy teenager who loved films and acting. So, if you're ready, can you tell us what happened to him whilst out there? He was abused by the producer. Do you mind saying his name? Jotham Starr. Jotham Starr of Yonder Starr Films? And what did he actually do to your son? He, um... He, um... He, um... It's OK. Is it correct for me to say that he made your son touch him inappropriately? Yes. And when your son returned home... what did he say to you? He showed us a video. He recorded the assault? Yeah. How did he do that? Because it wasn't the first time it happened. What can you see in the footage? You can just hear voices. But it's clear from the voices? It's very clear. It's an interesting choice that you went to a lawyer and not the police to report it as a crime. I mean... that feels like an odd decision to me. Why did you do that? Our son didn't want anyone to know. Whether that was right or wrong is, um... It's irrelevant, it's what we did. OK, so, sometime after seeing the lawyer, you spoke to someone at Yonder Starr Films. We took the video to them. And what did they say? That it had nothing conclusive on it. But they offered you a settlement. And you took it. Yes. I suppose the question I have, and I think our viewers will want to hear as well, is, how your son felt about you taking the money. Did you speak with him? Yeah. Yeah, of course. And what did you say? At first, he was relieved that... no-one else would have to know and he didn't have to see Jotham again. And then when we talked about the money, he, um... he just seemed to understand that it would give him... Us us all a... better life. And did it give you a better life? No. I'm sorry, I'm still struggling to understand, as a parent, why you would take the money over getting justice for your son. Our son had made it very clear... that he didn't want anyone else to know. We just felt like there was no other choice. Do you think you've failed him? At first, we tried to convince ourselves that we'd done the right thing. That there was no other option. But there was. We didn't have to take the money, so... Yeah. Yeah, we have failed him. And how is he now? Is he OK? No. No, he's not. Do you regret your decision? Every day. Moving forward, what do you want for your family? What I've always wanted. For my son to be happy and to be able to move on with his life. Everything all right? Sorry. It's OK. I know there isn't much to do around here but Tyrone will be home from school soon. Do you want to talk? Is it all getting a bit much? Yeah, it's just... not doing normal stuff. I've never played so much Xbox in my life. Well, maybe you should find a new hobby. No, it's not that I'm bored. It's just... I just miss school. I'm fed up of living like I'm hiding from everyone. Well, if you want to go back to school, you know what you have to do. - Er, but... - "But"? But what? Hello? Jotham can meet you tomorrow at 7:00. Location details to follow. OK. Do you regret your decision? Every day. Moving forward, what do you want for your family? What I've always wanted. For my son to be happy and to be able to move on with his life. You all right? Where's my school bag? Er, it's in the hallway. Why? I'm going back to school. What? No, no, there's no rush. You don't have to go back yet. I'm fed up of hiding like this. You know, the secret's out and... if people know, I don't care. And if people don't, I still don't care. I'm going back to school. Are you sure you don't want me to come with you? How am I going to do that, ride on the back? If I must. I'll text you when I get there. You'd better. Love you. Love you too. Hello. Isaac just wanted to let you know that he arrived safely. He is at school. Great, thanks for letting me know. Well, he couldn't actually text you because we don't allow mobile phones in school, so... Yeah, yeah, of course. I'll remind him he's not allowed his phone at school. - OK, thank you. - OK, bye. That's such a relief. Yeah, well, he was always going to be all right. Hello? Hi, Sam. It's Cheryl. I know I must be the last person you wanted to hear from, but I wondered if I could come round and see you and the family. When? We've had the concessions delivery. Thanks. Farah... I'm going to be leaving early today. Iman's not in, so can you keep an eye on the place? - Sure. - Thank you. Your interview was quite something. That wasn't Mum. Well, then... whoever that mother was, her story was very familiar. Especially the role the chaperone played. What is it you want to ask? You all right? Yeah. How was school? Yeah, it was fine. Listen, um... Cheryl's here. It's OK. She just wants to ask you something. Hey. What's up, Jess? You all right? So, since the newspaper article and that interview... other former child actors have come forward. They've been galvanised by you. They've joined together to prepare a court case against Jotham. Now, I've spoken to other former employees and we've all agreed to support the court case and break our NDAs. We want to do everything we can to get them justice. We were wondering... would you like to join us? You don't have to make a decision now. But whatever you do decide, I'm 100% behind you. I'm not missing any more school. OK. I love you. Hi. You all right? Yeah. I made you this, especially. I used the cooking spray oil and everything. Thanks. Put it on the table. Yeah. I'm sorry. For the newspaper article. I really thought it would help. It did. How's school? It's all right. I mean, there were... a few kids that stared as if they were unsure of something. The dinner lady clearly wanted to ask if I was the boy from the article, but she just gave me my food and that was it. No questions asked. It's cool. Well, I'm glad it was OK. - Hello? - Sam, do you know where your husband is? He was meant to meet Jotham, but he hasn't shown up. - When was this arranged? - Manny called me yesterday. Have you got a response to the allegations? Did you do it? Get out of my way. Anything? - Hey, it's Manny... - It's gone to voice mail. Hey, it's me, Dad. We're looking for you. Call us back. Just call him again, straight away. - Hey, it's Manny... - It's just the same thing. Try your brother. See if he's there. You got it, right? I don't pay you for nothing. I'm on it, I'm trying to find him. - OK, you know what I need is a retraction! - I'm on it. - Get it, now! - I'm on it. Fuck! Hey, it's Manny, leave a message. Dad, just stop it, all right? Please, you need to call us back. We're worried. I don't care what they said. I'm telling you, no press, do you understand? Hold on a second. - Stay down! Stay down! - Manny, what, what do you want?! - This is for my son! - Wait... Don't talk! Don't talk! Sit! You don't have to do this... Don't! What are you doing?! Don't look at me! Don't look at me! Don't look at me! Don't look at me! Don't look at me! Don't look at me! Don't, don't... Stay still! Don't cry! Don't cry! Don't you fucking cry, you fucking... God! God! Please... Just wait here. Manny? Manny! I-I-I didn't do anything. What...? All of this... it's my fault. The money. This house. It's... It's my fault. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I was wrong. It was a mistake. I was wrong. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I was wrong. I was wrong. We were wrong. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you sure it's all right for him to stay over? Yeah. As long as your dad's all right with the sofa. Yeah. That's cool with me. OK. I'll get a duvet. How you settling in? It's all right. There's no pool, though. Yeah. Hi. OK. Come on. To your seats as quickly as you can, come on. Bags down anywhere. Just get to your seats quickly, please. Come on, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet! Shh! Shh! Class, I am delighted to introduce you to our new teaching assistant, - Jess Mensah. - Hi! Hi! - They're not too bad. - They're lovely. - Hi. - Hey. - Good to see you. - And you. This is Mel, who used to be a producer at Yonder Starr. And, because of people like you coming forward, she's also broken her NDA. - It's nice to meet you and... thank you. - Sorry. Traffic was terrible. Sorry. Hey. Sorry. - I'm glad you came. - Of course. - Well, shall we, um...? - Yeah.
