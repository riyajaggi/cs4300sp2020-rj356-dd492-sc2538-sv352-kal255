 The producer says he's the best child actor he's ever worked with. - What is this? - I'm sorry. Don't. I don't like it. Between you and me, right? I don't want anyone else to know, not even Jess. If you're looking to pursue any legal claim against this producer, there's nothing that can be done here in the UK. I'm going to contact shell. I've never witnessed anything at Yonder Starr. It's really important that Isaac is being honest, especially when there's no proof.

 We do have proof. Fact is, this video shows nothing. What? This is a non-disclosure agreement. We'll also ensure that Isaac and my client's paths will never cross again. Finally, we hope that this will, in some way, help bring closure for Isaac. Jotham! Jotham! There's my champ. How you doing? Jotham! Jotham! Very nice houses around here.

 Sorry? Just saying, houses are very nice. Are you a sportsman? Or do you do that rap music? I'm the new leader of UKIP. - What you doing? - Dick. Yo. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing, fam. You still going to come to my birthday? Is it still a sleepover thing? Who else is coming? Lucas, Sean and my cousin, Mark. Look... That's a sausage fest, then. That sounds gay. We need some females. Yeah, like who? Anyone, as long as they're peng! Obviously. Yo, watch this. What you doing touching my skirt? Look, I saw you looking at me. OK, my boy's having a birthday party and I know you like hanging out with the mandem, so... Is this kid for real? Bitch! Lesbian! What, you not seen Scarface? Right, I'm done. Thanks, Ryan. You sure you got enough over there? It's from a friend's birthday party. Why have you never, ever introduced me to any of your friends? Cos you're far too young for any of them. But age ain't nothin' but a number. Sup? Hey, what's up, T? Good, fam. You're home early. Fire alarm, innit? Really? Me... I always tell the truth. Even when I lie. Hey, that's from Scarface, right? A man that knows! Tyrone, you're home early. Fire alarm, innit? Can you give us a minute? Yeah. Do you remember that Fortnite game you said you was going to teach me how to play? - Did I? - Yeah, the one with all the dancing and shooting and stuff. Have you received a missed call from Cheryl Denon or anyone at Yonder Starr? I'm not sure. My phone's been charging, why? Let me check it. Wait, hold on. Hello. Sorry, I think I've called the wrong number. It's fine, Cheryl. It's Sam. OK. Good. Hi, Sam. How are you? Fine. And Isaac? Fine. Good. So, I just touched down in London today. And would it be possible for me to visit? To discuss Isaac's media commitments. I can come to you for seven. I hear you've moved into a new place. OK. See you then, bye. Hey. - You all right? - Yeah. Cheryl called earlier and she wants to come around tonight to talk about publicity for the film. But you could just stay in your room. You don't even have to see her. No, it's all right. I want to know what she has to say. OK. You've got nothing to worry about, OK? Sam... can you get an extra ticket? For Tyrone, the premiere. Yeah, we can ask. - What you doing? - Making cereal. - Now? - Yeah. What? I'm just getting some hot milk. Tyrone... You know we're expecting someone. - Take that, there. - Please... Just go upstairs. Go upstairs. Hi. Didn't know you were coming. Didn't know I had to call ahead. - What's up, Jess? What you saying? - Hey. - You all right? - Yeah, fine. How's the new place? It's good, thank you. - How's your new place? - All right. Do you want something to eat? No, I'm not staying long. Actually, I wanted to ask you something. Yeah, um... Um... So, obviously, I wouldn't ask you this if there was any other way. Can you lend me some money? A couple hundred quid for my rent. Would you stop being stubborn and just move home? You're acting like it's your money. It's not your money, it's his money. He's worked for it, not you. - Hi, Manny. - Hey, Cheryl. - Please, come on in. - Thank you. Hey, Sam. Thanks for seeing me at such short notice. What happened? I cut it, cooking. Dear. Sorry to hear that. It's a lovely house. I'm glad something good came out of the situation. Something good? Sorry. I... So, erm, the press junket is all but finalised. That's the, erm... the film's promotion across TV, internet, print and so on. The schedule is pretty full-on, so Isaac might need to contact school and, erm... call in sick, just for a few days. The schedule's been arranged so that Isaac can warm up to the major interviews. He'll start with local press, and online, and so on, and in the second block, there's a range of major interviews including Chat Tonight. - Live TV? That's a terrible idea. - That's way too much. His co-stars, Mitch and Leti, will be there too, so most of the questions will go to them. I mean, I do understand your concerns. Thing is, it's been set up as a key cast invite. If Isaac doesn't appear, there will be questions. And say he's sick? If it can work for him missing school, it can work with Chat Tonight. I'm obliged to remind you that Isaac is under contract. I should do it. If I don't people will start asking questions. No-one's going to ask questions. They might. Anything else? So, erm... as you know, the world premiere is round the corner. Personally, I'm absolutely delighted that they're hosting it here in the UK, at your prestigious movie theatre. However, unfortunately... and this will be unwelcome news, I'm sure... Jotham Starr will be at the premiere. You're taking the piss, right? You lot said we wouldn't have to see him again. Why's he attending? What's he coming for? It's his film. So, what's the plan? I mean, the NDA never specified what happens when we... I'm so sorry, I'm not allowed to discuss this. Don't start that sorry shit again, you're not sorry. I'm going to leave you guys to it, yeah? - You all right? - Yeah. Who's that one that just arrived? She's a Hollywood exec, I think. This might be your chance. So, you go out there, get her digits, fam! I don't need her number. So you don't want to go to Hollywood, no? Young Tyrone! There's more to acting than Hollywood, yeah? Yeah, I know. There's Nollywood and Bollywood, but, Hollywood, man, that's Champions League football, right there. Why you let Isaac beat you to it? Beat to me to what? Just do what you're doing. For example, like, if you're both going for Valiant And Son, yeah, - who would've got it? - Lyle Valiant's a boy. All right, gee, gee, gee, but if the part could've been a boy or girl. - It's such a dumb question! - Why? Cos you know Isaac would've beat you to it? What's that about? - What's what about? - That laugh, what's it about? - Isaac, come on, just leave it. - No. I want to know, what's it about? Do you know what? You're the actor. I'm just at uni, yeah? I'm sorry, but that doesn't answer this question. There's nothing to say. He's been lucky. - Lucky? - Yes, lucky. You were able to take opportunities I wasn't, and, you know, he's made the most of it. Thought you two went to the same drama school. I'm not talking about drama school, talking about being able to skip school and go to auditions. - Isaac had no restrictions, I did. - That's lies. Isaac, come on. Do you really think Dad would've let me miss the amount of school you have? - Yes, obviously! - My days. Because if that was the case, that would be my Hollywood exec sat out there. Excuse me. I'm just saying that getting the part of Lyle Valiant took loads of hard work, loads of auditions, and not luck. Get over yourself. Thought you of all people would know what it takes. - Tell her what it takes. - It takes talent. Real talent. - Real talent! - No it doesn't. Yes, it does. You know it does. I'm not saying that there aren't amazing actors out there, but is that why YOU got Valiant And Son? I don't know, maybe it wasn't talent. Maybe it was your look. You're British, you're polite, you're mixed race. Come on, now. To paraphrase Zendaya, you're Hollywood's acceptable version of a black boy. - Bro! - I'm just saying. Maybe you got the role because they liked the look of you. Say it again. Full press week. Yonder Starr have agreed that I should be Isaac's publicity liaison officer so I'll be looking after him through all his interviews. Wasn't Cordelia going to sort out a publicity officer for Isaac? I've spoken to Isaac's agent. She agrees it's better if he has a friendly face. Someone who can keep him on message. You're there to make sure he doesn't reveal to the world - that your boss is a paedophile. - No, it's not that. I read the articles by these actresses coming out and exposing these dirty old men and you're scared Isaac's going to do the same. Sam, I, for one, am proud of those women who found the strength - and the courage to speak out. - It's all bullshit. Those men deserve everything that's coming to them. Including Jotham? The only reason we're not breaking our NDA is because of Isaac. We don't want to put him though that public hell. - Sam, please. - But don't take that to mean that we have forgiven and forgotten, because we haven't. We must all try to move on. Move on?! Cheryl, there's no moving on. Not until that man accounts for what he's done. What is this?! What is this? What is this? Why you looking at me?! - Cos you started all of this. - YOU started all of this! Hey, hey, hey! Calm down, just calm down. It's OK. Look after your golden boy and your lovechild, yeah? And... don't ever call me or message me again. - I'm done with you. - I'm done with you! See her? You think this is funny? It's hilarious. Go upstairs. Go upstairs! Say goodnight to Mr Bad Guy. He needs to leave. I mean it. He has to go. I heard you tried turn Ainsley Harriott and nearly died. Yeah, something like that. You come from work? Nah, day off. I commend your loyalty to that place. - Was that a compliment or a diss? - It's a compliment! I mean, you're probably the first employee of ULC Cinemas - that drives a Porsche. - A second-hand Porsche. I'm sure the chief exec has one. When was the last time he served popcorn in one of his cinemas? - Do we have to chat about that place? - We had some fun times there. I don't remember you ever having fun there. Really? I've got an early start tomorrow, so... Yeah, sorry. Sorry. What have you done to Sam? - Or what are you hiding from Sam? - Nothing. Is it Tyrone? - You ready to wash your hands of him? - No. He told me your wife goes on at him a lot. When he's back here don't you go on at him a lot? Yeah. About his schoolwork, his attitude to learning, not how he chews or how loud he laughs. And the fact that I have to remind him to shower, and not to put plastic in the cardboard bin. To scrape his plate before he puts it in the dishwasher. Stop it. Do you think with everything that's happened to Isaac - it might have made things a bit tricky? - What things? Just... his success. He's not a regular kid any more. Nah, it's not Isaac's fault. I'll be real with you, though, the money, it's an issue. You made that money with Isaac's talent and then you bettered yourself. That's what everyone dreams of. You shouldn't be ashamed of financial reward, - you should be proud of it. - Don't say that. You know you're a role model, right? What? Yeah. To all those fathers out there. Showing what you can do when you put your all into raising your children. I should go. Hey. You know you can talk to me, right? I know. - Hi. - Hey. Did you talk to Sabrina? No. She wasn't in. Do you remember when Jess used to put on plays with her teddy bears? And that time she got Isaac involved and drew on his face with my eyebrow pencil? Make-up game. He was a zebra. No, he was a lion. He was the Lion King, he was Simba. We'll be fine. OK? It's such a thrill to have him on Chat Tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, Darren Barber! It's great to get the chance to meet you. Is it Darren or Dazza? - Dazza, yeah. - OK, Dazza. How did it all start? - You all right? - Yeah. You still want to do the interview? Yeah. What about the premiere? If you still want to go, you have nothing to worry about. Because I'm going to be there the whole time. And if he... has any sense, he'll keep his distance. Trust me. I've come for Isaac. Isaac? Take the worksheets with you, bring them back next lesson. You sure you can't come tonight? Sorry, man, I've got a TV interview and I can't miss it. All right. Everyone wish Isaac luck! - Good luck. - That's my guy, Isaac! Cheers, Miss. We'll go outside, yeah? Yes. Er... but just before you go I wanted to have a brief word. - Yeah? - Tasha and Leoni from 11B say that you tried to pull up their skirts. That's bare lies. I also have witnesses who say that you called them a bitch and lesbian. Do you find that funny? No, look, I was just playing around. I didn't even lift their skirt or anything, just tugged on it, and it wasn't even a proper tug. What makes you think that you can touch her in that way? You have absolutely no right to touch. Look, I tugged her skirt. It's not like I touched her leg, is it? Right. I know that you've got this interview today and I'm not going to disrupt that, but I will be following up with your parents tomorrow. Thank you. Give us a couple of minutes. Can numbers 25, 11, 5, 28, 3, 12, 13, 31, and... number 4 please come to the front? Thank you, front row. You're free to leave. Back row! We'll see you tomorrow. The large container is for you. - It has extra pepper in it. - I told you about my blood pressure. Your blood pressure is up because you're living above your means. Mum, I love you, but please stop. Check you, though! I have something for you. This just to say good luck for when your film comes out. I thought more appropriate than buying you more computer game vouchers. - Thanks, Grandma. - Mwah! Er... Is he going in trainers? - Yep. - We want him to look 14, not 44. Don't you want him to look smart? Our professional stylist thinks he looks fine. Don't you, Hayley? - It looks good. - Thanks. Driver will be here soon. Tyrone texted me and said he's going to be here soon as well. We'll probably be gone by the time he arrives. Maybe he can come to the next interview. Manuel, I'll cook some plantain. - OK. Yes, please. - No. There's no time for that. It's only because his hand is still wrapped up. Well, if anything I can cook them later. - You? - After 20 years with your son, don't you think I should know how to cook his food? Mum. You want a lift? No, thank you. My prince, have a wonderful time. Yo! Yo. - Come on. - Rapscallion! Now, Tyrone. - I brought plantain. - Ai! Maybe your stepmum will cook you some later. God bless you all. You staying, fam? - Smart cazh, yeah? - Safe, man. Can I still come? Yeah, but you got to be quick, man. You look a mess. Let me just spray a lick of Lynx, yeah, and I'm good to go. No, you go upstairs and you will shower. I was just joking. Damn. Quick! Hi, everyone. Hello. Hi! Isaac, you look fantastic. Er, sorry. I know I didn't mention... I wanted my brother to be here. Is that all right? Yeah, I'm sure that won't be a problem. Daniel, can you take Isaac's guests to their seats? And Isaac, I'll take you to the green room. What's the green room? It's the lounge where all the show's guests wait to be called. - I'm not sure about that. - Yeah. We should wait with him until he's called. I mean, it'll be fine. I'll be with him. - I'll go with Isaac. - No, I'll go with Isaac. You can stay with Tyrone. OK! Shall we...? Yeah? Ladies and gentlemen, the studio is now open. Please take your seats and ensure your mobile phones are switched off. - Sam? - No, thanks. Isaac? Just... an attempt at humour. Here you are. Isaac! - Hey, Dad! - You been a good boy? You know I got spies all around the galaxy. - Yeah, I know. - Isaac! Hello, baby. I love your hair. And this must be Sam. Isaac, you never told me your mom was so beautiful. Love your shoes. Ladies and gentlemen, the show will start in ten minutes. Please take your seats. - Excuse me. - The show will start in ten minutes. Sorry. This set looks budget, man. Yo, it looks like one of them shows you used to watch when you was younger. What's it called? Like, Black Peter or something? Blue Peter. Put your phone away. Hello, Mr Mensah. I don't know if you remember me. My name is Dominic, Dominic Nadesan. We were in contact briefly last year about a story you had. Sorry, we're not interested. Thank you. Your story means a lot to me. I have a young son, too. I said we're not interested. People are breaking their silence. You're not alone. Ladies and gentlemen, the show will start in five minutes. Please, can you all take your seats? And can I ask you to turn your mobile phones off, please? She'll start by asking you about your first day on set. You could answer using your "personal assistant iPhone" material, OK? Which the audience will love. But if he asks you anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, just don't answer, OK? We're ready for you on set. You'll be fine. What a show we've got for you this evening. Later on, a live performance of their brand-new hit single from The Youngers. Let's get some guests on the sofa. We have with us the cast of the latest Hollywood blockbuster, Valiant And Son, and leading the way, a stunning actress. She's an author, she's a two-time Golden Globe nominee. It's Leti Anderson. Next up, he is one of Hollywood's biggest stars. Everything he touches turns to gold, scream your hearts out, it's only Mitch Colney! It's lovely to have you back. Fantastic. And last but not least, he is a ridiculously talented 14-year-old who saw off nearly 500 other boys to land his first role in a Hollywood movie. It's his first time on the show. Please, make him feel welcome. It's Isaac Mensah! Brother Isaac! Bra! Bra! Bra! Bra! You guys, you must have been on quite the tour so far. Party, party, party? You know me. - It's just great to be back in London. - We love London. So, Isaac, what about you? You play Mitch's son, actually, the courageous Lyle Valiant. Yeah. And there you are, in the film. What was it like walking onto set with all of these established stars? Well you know, they're... people just like us, but more tanned. They do have a glow about them, that's for sure. Was there anything unexpected, anything that surprised - you about it all? - Well, yeah. To be honest, I was kind of shocked by the amount of assistants some people had. I mean, there was a wardrobe assistant... - Make-up Assistant? - Make-up Assistant. Yeah. And there's a script assistant. You must have had your own assistants, I mean, an entourage of them? Yeah. I mean, no. - I got an iPhone. - Right. Sorry, what I mean is, I've got an iPhone and that was my... personal assistant while I was away. It's the modern way. He'll recover. Where do you get the confidence from to do what you do, the energy? I'd say candy and Red Bull. Other brands are available. This is the BBC. You've got a huge amount of support, I mean, particularly in North London... Whoo! North London! And your family, they must be right behind you. Who are the people who've helped you get where you are now? Um... Well, to be honest, there's two people in my life. First off being my brother Tyrone. He's actually in the audience tonight. He keeps me grounded. Yeah, that's me! And then, there's my amazing sister, Jess. We went to drama school together, actually, on the weekends. Shout out to Avril Allen's! Yeah, I mean, she's done the sensible thing and gone to uni. I respect her in that way, because she is a better actor than me. That is so, so sweet. You must be so proud. Well, let's be honest. My brother's a much better actor than me. It's why he went into politics. How is he getting on with the new administration? You know him, he's just taking it in his stride. - You seen him recently? - We played golf the other day. First time seeing each other in a while. Isaac. Isaac. Tyrone, go to bed. - What? But I'm thirsty, man. - Bed, now. That was such a bad idea. He hates us. I don't blame him. No, he doesn't. You still think he should go to the premiere? Yeah. It's his film as much as anyone else's. He deserves to celebrate his hard work. See you upstairs. I know Isaac has his film coming out, but his behaviour is unacceptable. Has he mentioned I spoke to him? No, there's been no mention of it. I have to take these kind of accusations seriously. Of course. I wouldn't expect you to react in any other way. Well, he's also been quoting the movie Scarface. - Scarface? - Yes. - Do you have it? - No, we um... Hi. We don't have it here. Someone at school must've shown it to him. You know we have a zero-tolerance policy on this kind of behavior. Are you sure things happened as they said? - I am, yes. - It's just, I know my son... I have no reason to doubt the other students. OK. OK, well, I'm sorry he's had to miss these last few days at school. He'll be back in tomorrow, for sure. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Bye. Isaac? Hey. - You all right? - Yeah. I just woke up. Had a bit of a mad one last night. I'll come get you, one sec. Where's Isaac? You seen Isaac? Don't ignore me. - Have some respect. - What you doing? You have some respect! No, go on. Yeah, you best stay silent! Especially cos my brother told me what's really going on around here! And what is really going on around here? Come on, man! Spending half the money he earns! The house, the car. Your dead extensions! I told him to call Childline. I'm calling your father. Call him! Ain't going to change the fact that Isaac hates you! I want you out of this house now. Ain't going to change the facts. Using him for all of this. That's abuse. You're actually abusing him! I'm sorry. Tyrone! Ty! Even in the audience from backstage, sucking all the air out the room, I got mad light-headed, and the press just asking the same questions over and over and over. It was jarring. Price of success. Have you had any auditions recently? - Er... Yeah, yeah. - Thanks. I don't really think I can hack the rejection game much longer. Think I might apply for some part-time jobs. Student loan's running pretty dry. It's the 200 you asked for. Isaac, I can't... I can't. And secondly... please could you come to the premiere? We can give you a lift. Er... I'd love to, but I... can't. I'm sorry. My uni work's mental, I've got loads of deadlines. Thank you for asking, though. I'm sorry. I did try to talk to him calmly. Did you ask him to leave? Why would I do that? Well, you seemed pretty certain that you wanted him out the other night, didn't you? Don't be too hard on him. - Manny, he groped someone! - You don't know that for sure! Hey. More flowers? - How's Jess? - She's all right. Sit down. Your dad and I need to talk to you about something. Tyrone's gone back to his mum's. What? Yeah. - He just felt like it was time. - But you do know he's supposed to be coming to the premiere tonight? I know. I had a call today from your head teacher. Whatever she said is lies. - You don't know what I'm going to say... - Let him talk. No! What's this about you inappropriately touching someone? Look, my hand brushed past her skirt. - No word of lie, that's it. - Is that the truth? - Of course it's the truth! - How can you ask him that? He's just told you what happened. Why is his head teacher calling me up, then? You shouldn't be jumping to conclusions. I'm not jumping to conclusions! It's probably just some girl - trying to get him in trouble. - Why would she do that? Because she's jealous of him or she wants attention. You sound like Jotham's lawyers. That's low. They accused Isaac of lying. That's different, and you know it. Isaac, what are you doing? Isaac, what are you doing?! Hey. I know you like to appear strong in front of your mum, but you don't have to do that with me. We don't have to go to the premiere. How you doing Champ? Fine. I've just seen the dailies... You made a copy?! Do you realise we could be sued? What if it fell into the wrong hands? You promised me he wouldn't get away with. And he's getting away with it. But there's still tonight. He's going to be there tonight, yeah? Please delete it. Car's here. Manny? Car. Are you crazy?! Did you not think I was going to find out?! - Sabrina, I'm sorry. - What were you thinking? What the hell were you thinking?! I'm so sorry. - Tyrone told me what your wife did. - It was a misunderstanding. I'm so sorry. Is this what you were worried about the other night? It is only out of respect for the kids that I'm not going to make a scene, but trust me, you touch my son again, and I will slap you myself. Can I still go? Hurry up. I'll see you after. You told me she wasn't there the other night. What? Isaac! Isaac! Isaac, come here! Yeah! Dad, Dad, Dad! Mad! How you doing? Thank you. Thanks, guys. Hi. Thank you. Hey. All right, shall we? You look so beautiful! Yo, this is crazy! - Jotham! - Jotham! Jotham! There's my champ! How you doing? Thanks for coming, guys. Jotham! Jotham! Jotham! Hey, Jotham! Manny, Manny, they're asking for a family shot. Come on. Yo, this is crazy, bro! Cool! - Cheers! - It's all right. Yo, aye G, look who it is, fam! That's a nice one. That's a nice one. - You look good! - I look good? Yeah, you look like a black James Bond. Go back to work! It's been handed over to me, you know? - Can you just give me a second? - Jotham! - Hey, Manny. - My family and I demand... - How you doing? - ..an apology. This is great, isn't it? Isaac's big night. - This is Manny, Isaac's dad. - Hi! - It's lovely to meet you. - Look... - Look, Isaac... is the best child actor I've ever worked with, a real talented little kid. You know, when I look at Isaac, I see an artist who's dedicated to his craft, but also someone who knows the true value of respect for others. That's down to you and your parenting. God bless you all. Enjoy the movie. It's been such a wild ride, making this film. That's why it's a great pleasure of ours to introduce the man that put all this together, a great friend of mine, Jotham, Jotham Starr. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for coming out and supporting our little labour of love. I would particularly like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the outstanding crew and fantastic cast led by the amazing Mitch Colney, the always fabulous Leti Anderson, and, of course, Hollywood's newest heart-throb... Isaac Mensah. Yeah, bro! Yo! Hollywood rocks! Thank you. Now, I know you're all going to sit back and love this movie, and we'll see you out in the lobby afterwards for a little shindig. Thank you. Valiant And Son, the sequel. The producers want to recast Isaac, as well. It's my part and my role, and you're going to try and take it away from me? All I'm trying to do is what's best for Isaac. He's not happy! I see a strong young man that's left the past behind him. You need to let go of what's happened. I can't! Come on, baby. You're just going to leave me getting cold? You don't want people knowing about the money. Because it will destroy all of our lives! Jess, what you think is success is a lie. Isaac, the money, I'm waiting.
