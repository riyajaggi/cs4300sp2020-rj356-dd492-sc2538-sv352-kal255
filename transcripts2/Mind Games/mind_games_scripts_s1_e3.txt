 Previously on "Mind Games"... - What the hell is she doing here? - Who's that? My ex-wife. Our new office manager! Claire calms me down, Ross. She's like a magic feather. With a job like this, I could use what I know but stay out of trouble. Sam, I'd love to help you out, but right now, we can't even afford to pay for our light bulbs. You paid me to get Clark to fall for me. You didn't say I wasn't allowed to fall for him. I know you! You're Beth's friend, Ross.

 You claimed you met Beth for the first time in the lobby. - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com - My brother... he'll be here any second. He's r... really excited to meet you guys. We were gonna put some music in here. The office... so it wasn't so quiet. Also, music... activates a... a certain... There he is! Thank God! - Ross... - Not right now. Guess we... let's start. - Peekaboo. - I always sucked at hide-and-seek. Until recently, - I would just stand there with my eyes closed... - Ross...

 and try to be invisible. - What are you doing here? - Clark hired me. Look, I... I went to him because I was afraid it would be an awkward conversation for you. 'Cause I had already said no. And that was awkward for you. I could tell. But Clark said that you would yell at him for hiring me. He said that you don't have any faith in his decision-making. - So if you're gonna say no... - Again. ... just say it now, and I'll leave. I seriously don't want to cause any problems between you guys. No. Oh. I mean, no, no, it's fine. Really? - Yeah. - Re... oh, well, thank you. Seriously. No, j... just don't... don't tell Clark that I told you. You know, let him do it his way. She was such a normal, happy girl. She had friends. She was getting almost all A's at Northwestern. This video was shot last week. It's a gift to us. The earth is a gift to us. Kids experiment. When I went to college... You didn't go to college. I went to college. I just didn't keep going. It's not college. It's him... Jonah Cain. The earth is a gift to us! If I gave you a gift and then went to your home and found that gift in the garbage with the styrofoam plastic containers and the animal bones, well, that would make you a bad friend. She went to one of his awareness workshops, which is, I guess, how it starts. At first, she would just come home on the weekends and tell us we were doing everything wrong, like most kids, I guess. - Most kids don't call their mother a murderer. - Ah, yeah. The earth. I was... I was murdering the earth. And then she dropped out of college because of him. - We didn't even know till her best friend called... - Gabriela. ... and asked if we'd heard from her. So we hired a private investigator, and he told us this Jonah forces his people to cut off all ties to anybody they know. She... she won't even speak to us. She says we're not her family anymore. She might as well be... - ... gone. - So it's like a cult. No, it's not like a cult. A cult is exactly what it is. Maybe with no smiling? It's a cult. We have been studying cult indoctrination on a microlevel for years. And... and this guy's a textbook operator. That's why I said, from day one, we should go in there and take her back. Except you being in jail doesn't really solve the problem, does it? Also... and please understand we want to help you any way possible, but Sofie is 18. She's free to choose. No, she's not. - What? - No. At least not in her own mind. Guys like this Jonah... they manipulate their victims into feeling like they have no choice. They prey on people in high-stress situations... kids in college, children of divorce. They erode their sense of self, maybe give them new names. "Ocean." Apparently, she's Ocean now. Hmm. Oh, look, look. You see how he stands inside the personal space of this kid, - do you have any idea... - Eroding his sense of self? See? These tactics are elementary but reliable and totally invisible. - It's gone! - Except to us. We can use them to get your daughter out the same way that he used them to get her in, right? Oh! Like that game. Do you remember that game? Operation... where you're trying to get the wishbone out of the little hole, but you don't want to... you can't hit the sides, 'cause it's so... it's so stressful. Do you remember that? It's the same. But what if you could make the wishbone come to you? You could do that? You can get our Sofie out - and make her come home? - Oh, better. We can make her want to come home. Beth? Hey, Beth. What's up? Claire called me last night. She wants to have dinner tonight. Why would she do that? Does she know something? Uh, no, of course not. She works with Clark. Probably just wants to get to know his girlfriend better. It's a good thing. Just don't let her pick Lombardi's. She thinks it's great, but it's not. Bye. - Hey! - Hey. I got to get to work. I got coffee from that place you like. Oh. Thanks. I'm actually doing tea now. W... why did you ask Beth to dinner? Why would you care? 'Cause if you have a question about something, leave her out of it. Ask me. Right, 'cause if there's anyone I trust to tell me the truth, Ross, it's you. Try me. Really? Why did you lie to me about meeting Beth? Are you having an affair with her? What?! No! God! She's my brother's girlfriend. What is wrong with you? Well, because you and I aren't together, so if it were anyone else, I probably wouldn't care, - but because... - No, no. It's nothing like that. Okay. Then what? Which is why I called Beth. It's worse. At least you'll think so. Maybe it is. I don't know. Tell me. Just know I did it because I'm his brother. I'm not some sociopath. Well, there's no reason you can't be both. To watch him in that stupid teaching job, wasting his brain and his talent on people who didn't even appreciate... What did you do, Ross? I paid Beth to get him fired. Make him fall for her, have an affair so he'd be free to work with me. But... but here's the thing... she gave back the money. Where are you going? Claire! - Claire. - Where do you think I'm going, Ross? I'm going to tell Clark. - She gave the money... - How can you possibly think that's the issue here? Look at them. Clark is happy. They're in love, Claire. - How can you know that? - Because I hired someone to pretend to offer money to file a lawsuit. Oh, my God. It's just lies. Everything out of your mouth is lies and lies. The point is, Clark is better off. Great. See? You want the truth. Then you punish me for saying it! Up. Me last! - Claire! - Hi. Do you remember how I stopped eating bagels because of when they weren't perfectly round? I couldn't concentrate, so I'd nibble around the edges until they were round. - Yes. - But then I couldn't eat them because I'd have to spread the cream cheese until it was exactly smooth so I wasn't getting any work done? Beth got a guy at the bagel store to set aside two perfectly round bagels for me every morning. And you know that guy, - the bagel guy? - Yeah? I think he's got a crush on you, but you know what I say? Who, who, who... who cares?! I don't care! She gets it. Oh, man. Everything all right? Yeah, I think so. Claire? Um... Yes. Yes. - Great. - Everything's great. Everybody's great. Let's get to work. - We've got to get a girl out of a cult. - Yes. Okay, you know what? I should probably go, too. Oh, sorry. Geez. I'm sorry. Do you still, uh, want to get dinner tonight? Oh. Um, yeah, actually, no. I'm... I'm, uh... I'm not feeling so great. - Maybe another night? - Yeah. Bye. - Thanks. - Shut up. This is a two-part strategy. Our operative Megan made contact with your daughter this morning. Now, using specific behavioral cues, she started to make Sofie bond with her, but making Sofie think that it was her own idea. Did you know that after hurricane Katrina, 150% more money came in from people whose name started with "K"? See, we're programmed to like what's ours. Hi. You seem upset. We even respond far better to someone who just shares the first letter of our own name. - What's your name? - Sandra. So while Sofie thinks that she's drawing Megan in, Megan will actually be working on Sofie, subconsciously blurring the boundaries between them... frequent touching, mimicry, having an amazing amount of experiences in common. Maybe it all started when my parents got a divorce. Is this our fault? What do you mean? Our divorce. - No. Come on. - Maybe. - No. No! - Maybe. The cult provides family structure. Any experienced manipulator will use a person's need for family against them. So, let's say your girl and ours are buddies. What then? We carve her away from the group. Jonah's leading an awareness workshop tonight... - If you want to come. - Yeah. I already know I want to be a part of what you guys are doing. - Um, it's just... - What? My dad. I don't think I can just leave without telling him where I went. No, forget it. I... Wait. What if I go with you? Yeah? When the hook is set, she reels her in. Megan uses emotional triggers... words like "home," "family." She'll talk about things from Sofie's childhood to stir up memories. So, by the time Sofie's here, on an unconscious level, she's thinking about seeing you guys and feeling positive about it. Ooh! Sorry. Wait. No, no, no, no. Oh, my God. I used to love this song! - No way. - Yes. Me, too. Maybe we let her down. You know, when she was little, she used to sleep between us. She was so safe in there. She couldn't fall off the bed. And then we got divorced. It... it's like one day, she had us both, and the next day, sh... sh... there was the edge of the bed. I cannot wait to meet this guy. No, he's amazing. You're gonna love Jonah. - He's the most amazing man ever. - Hi. Ocean, who's your friend? Jonah, this is Sandra. Sandra is very interested in the movement. Is that what you're interested in, Sandra? Or are you just trying to make off with our Ocean here? What's he talking about? Um... I don't... I don't... I don't know. Hey. - How did he spot you? - I don't know. Well, the techniques are proven, so you must have done them wrong. How do you know? You weren't there. No, he's right. It's my fault. No, it's my fault. I underestimated our opponent. It doesn't matter whose fault it is. Now we know we're up against someone way smarter about this stuff than we thought. We just need to figure another way to get the girl out. Yeah, except he told me to tell you you'll never get her back now. Because now he knows we're coming. So we made it worse. Damn it! I screwed up, and now I made it worse. Claire! All right, all right. Let's isolate the problem. Jonah knows that we're coming after Sofie, so he's not gonna let her out of his sight. So use it against him. I'm sorry. Uh... Am I not supposed to talk? I'm kind of new at this. No, you can talk. All right, well, he's watching the girl so hard that he's left himself open. So we make Jonah the target. Yeah. So, um, what do we know about him? Does he have a record or... - I'm not sure. - What about his background? Seriously? This is all the research you did on your mark? He's not a mark, and this is not a con job. Do you have any idea what we're doing? More importantly, do you? - I'm sorry. Are you in meetings now? - Apparently so. Come on. We're just wasting time here. I say we go in, we kidnap the girl, then we do the mind tricks once she's safe in hand. Let me remind you that we don't do anything illegal. Now, I'll put up some signs in the office, if that helps. It's only illegal if we get caught. - I'm just saying. - Oh, good. That'll be a great poster for the lobby. Ross is right! We can't leave anything to chance. I set us back. I got cocky. And now we need a bulletproof, multi-pronged attack with strategies that we haven't even tried before, but I can't think of any because I need Claire! Where the hell is Claire?! I'll find her, okay? I'll find her. Stop! Where have you been? Clark is losing it. What are you doing, Claire? Are you moving? You were right. I can't tell him about Beth. It'll destroy him. What do you think this is gonna do? I mean, you're Clark's magic feather. He'll... he'll... he'll spin out if you go. Come on. He already is. Think of that girl and her parents. So, what do you... what do you want me to do, Ross? What do you want me to do? You want me to just go in there every day, see his face, just lie to him? You know, you and I don't share that particular skill set. Claire, you don't want to do this. No, I don't. I don't. I wanted to stay here. You remember where I was working before. Yeah, the... the dentist's office. Yeah, and there's nothing wrong with working at a dentist's office, okay? Okay? People need dentists, and dentists need people to work in their office. But this... I mean, this... look, even if you started this company for all the wrong reasons, Ross, Clark didn't, and it is changing lives, and I got to be a part of that. And then, like everything else in my life, you took it from me. You have this, like, amazing power to take things from me. Okay, okay. If you mean our marriage, you are the one... Don't you dare say that it was my choice to talk to the police. I swear to you... I will kill you with that suitcase and roll your body out in it. I swear to God, Ross. Taking something from you was the last thing I wanted. I wanted you to have everything. Maybe. Who knows? I mean, who knows anything? It's why I did it... for us. The house. I just wanted you to have everything that you deserved. Well, maybe that's your M.O. Maybe you tell people after you ruin their lives that it was all for their own good. Has he slept? Probably not. Is that bad? - It could go either way. - Here's something. Jonah's showing up in papers in other cities. Looks like he's expanding outside of Chicago. Claire! Claire! - Can we... can we talk? - No, no, no. Come to my office. - I need to... I... - Sit over here. Wait. Over there. That's my hat. - Yes, I know. - Clark. Okay, Clark, please don't go through my things when I'm gone. All right? Well, I needed something to remind me of you, - since you weren't here. - Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen, I need to talk to you. I have to leave, Clark. What are you talking about? You just... Wait. - No! - Yes, yes, yes. Listen, Clark... Clark, listen, I was offered a job, okay? At a wildlife foundation in Florida. - And it's at... - I don't believe you. Well, I applied with them a long time ago. - It was way before... - What's the name of the foundation? The Wekiva Wetlands Preserve. And I have been dreaming about working with them ever since I went to Orlando on that trip. - Remember my... - Why is it a better job than this? Well, I get to... I get to do good work. You could do good work here. I know, but it is not... this is not what I want. Oh, 'cause you want to help snakes? You want to help birds? - Yes, and there are otters and... - We help people! It's not what I want, okay? - It never was. - Is it Ross? - What did he do? Did he do something? - No. No! Nothing. I just... I need to go. Okay? But listen to me. Listen. I feel okay about it because you... you are doing so well. And you and Beth are happy, and you're in such a good place, Clark. You can do this without me. I'm wearing your hat! You can do this, okay? - Please? - No. P... please? No, this is a good thing. - Listen. Please don't make this so... - No, I can't. - I can't do this without you. - Yes, you can. - No, I can't. - Look at me. Yes, you can. - No, no, no. No! - Yes. Yes, you can. - No, no! I can't! Please. - You can. Yes, ye... okay. Okay. Okay? Okay. I'll stay. Okay. Okay. So, when you say you want to access Sofie's brain... we induce trance state and then subconsciously suggest that she leave the cult and go back to her parents. - You want to hypnotize her? - No. Well, yeah. But "hypnotize" makes it sound like a sideshow act. Yes. Yes, it does. Hey, we all experience trance states. Did... did you ever drive home from work, and then after you arrive, you realize you can't remember any of the turns that got you there? But surreptitious trance-state induction... that hasn't been tried before, since it requires a proximal and suggestible subject. Um, one in five people are classified as highly suggestible, and since Sofie was talked into joining a cult, I'd say that she qualifies. But trance-state implantation, even under laboratory conditions... which this is very much not... that can leave a subject negatively impacted. A girl is gone... And her family broken apart because of my screw-up. I'd say she's already negatively impacted. Okay, let's say that she is suggestible. What about the proximity part? Okay, we distract Jonah, we grab her, and we take her somewhere. Again, kidnapping. No, it's not kidnapping if she wants to go. We fake a kidnapping, scare her, and then, when we rescue her from it... We're the good guys, and she trusts us. I like it, and I think it'll work. You think it'll work? Uh, it better. Because I know why Jonah said that we would never get to Sofie. A girl who left the cult a month ago wrote in her blog that he's been busing followers from here every few days to start a "sustainable-living settlement in the forests of Monterrey." California? Mexico. Well, then we just do all of the same stuff that I just... That you've never tried before. But we do it really fast. All right, Ross, your team... work on distracting Jonah. Mine... prepare for trance-state induction. Do you need a gold pocket watch? No, I need an oscilloscope and a biorhythm sensor from the university sleep lab. Also, optical illusion, boom box, mp3 file with yucatan trance drumming to induce hippocampal theta waves in a range from 6 to 10 hertz. Hypnotism without the tuxedo... science. So, guess you're not going to prom with the new girl. We're fine. It's fine. I mean, okay. I kind of get why Ross hired her. Maybe she can be useful. But if he's gonna start dragging in people from his old life, - then, I mean... - You mean why Clark hired her. No, she told me... Ross. Hello. Hey, there! Just about finished. With? Eh, the city's putting in all these co2 monitors in all the buildings in the area. They ain't nothing to worry about. Probably just some desk jockey justifying his job. All right. That looks good. Take care. Thanks for the ladder. We have a problem. Who actually hired Sam? - He did. - He did. And that is our problem. Got you. You really thought you could get away with it? Ross, I told you that no one would hire me. - I told you that. - Yeah, you did. I mean, this is all on me. All right, look, you and I... we got out of prison at the same time, except I didn't have a brother that I could start a business with. I'm trying here, guys, but I... I can't even get an apartment. I've got no credit. I've got no credit cards. I mean, what am I supposed to do? Get a job at the mall and sell pretzels? I just need to get over this little hump, and I'll be okay. But I need something real, like this job, to prove to everyone that I've changed. But... But you haven't. I have now. All right, we need you for this case tomorrow. Then after that, that's it. Come on. - People usually don't change, huh? - They do. It's just... A lot harder if the environmental factors stay the same. Are you suggesting, for Sam, that working for a company that practices deception isn't quite far enough off the path? Yeah, I think we need some pie. All right. - Apple. - Apple. All right. Jonah. Dr. Edwards. Nice to meet the wizard behind the curtain. No wizard. - Just a scientist. - No. The tricks you used on Ocean were impressive. I was excited to see what was coming next. - I'm almost sorry I had to pull the plug. - Well, thanks. Thought I'd just throw that first pitch right down the middle, - not show the good stuff yet. - Like the hidden camera? - For instance. - Don't feel bad that didn't work. I'm... I'm so used to keeping my eyes open. I got so many people want to bring me down. Oh, I can imagine. But when they see your skills, I would say that most people probably wouldn't even bother to try. Thank you. Most people. Well, let's agree that we both have the same goal... rescue a young woman from a harmful lifestyle and install her into a healthy one. And we use similar tactics to do it, so, in fact, - we're actually a lot alike. - No. The difference is... I do it because I love this planet... ... to awaken a young woman's spirit. And you... Just do it for the money. That's not true. Do you know anything about her home, what her parents' values are, who she is? No? Then why is what you do so good and what I do so bad? You're in my chair. - So, he's already on to us, huh? - Yep. And a day early. Even better. Hey. You okay? Yeah. Eat your pie. What do you mean, you're not gonna do it? We're gonna do most of it, just not the part where we make her go back home. That's the part we want! This isn't for sure. We're still discussing strategy. No. No, we're not. Look, I was up all night over this. What we're doing is no different from what Jonah does. What is he talking about?! Look, Jonah took Sofie and made her what he wanted her to be. Now you want to take her and make her what you want her to be, and all without her deciding for herself what she wants. She's clearly not capable of making decisions for herself. It's why she's in a cult. That's what parents do... they help their kids make decisions. Yes, that's true. But, eventually, they all have to do it for themselves. And if you're wrong? If she decides to stay with the cult? Let me just talk with my brother for a minute. Excuse us. What did Jonah say to you last night? Nothing. He got to you, didn't he? He's that good. - No, he didn't get to me. - He's that good. - He got to you. - No. Yeah. I... I'm just not gonna... deprogram Sofie, Deprogram Sofie, then turn around and reprogram her. Just do the plan. Her parents didn't pay to hear your personal philosophy of self-determination. - We... we're not... - They don't care. We're not puppet masters here pulling the strings because we can, okay? We're not God. No, we are Santa Claus, and her parents sat on our lap and asked us to please rescue their daughter from a cult. - That doesn't sound like a morally debatable request to me. - Okay, all right. The next time that she does something that they disapprove of or we disapprove of, what then? What? I'm not gonna put Sofie back the way she was without making her stronger, able to make her own choices. Then we haven't done anything. I want what's best for Sofie. Jonah... he wants Sofie. That's how we're different. Let's go, people! We're getting close. Jonah Cain. Cecelia Green... Green, Meyers & Young. It's an environmental movement. People are free to join or not to join. Have you ever seen these men? Why? Well, I represent a number of victims who were forcibly taken from situations like your movement, and I'm trying to build enough of a case to make it against the law. Kidnapping is against the law. Well, not when they call it "rescuing." My parents forcibly deprogrammed my sister, and two months later... she killed herself. So if this is all that I can do, I'm gonna do it. What do you need from me? Evidence. The courts need to see proof that these companies go beyond just exit counseling. And I have a friend at the Sun-Times who said she would write a story if I brought her some and someone to go on record. Now, will this help me in my class-action suit? Yes, but it will also get your movement a lot more exposure than a few Internet videos. I'm gonna call her and tell her we're on our way. Hi. Can you take us to the north side on Damen? Sam has him. Go! Okay, everybody going to Mexico, Jonah wants you to start loading up, all right? Mexico group, let's go! Just leave your stuff at the back of the bus. Hey, Ocean. Can I talk to you for a sec? - Go away. - No, no, no, no, no! Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey, cross the street. Jonah has a safe place. - I just want to talk to her real... - Leave her alone! What? Go, go! Go, go! Come on, Miles! What the hell was that? Hi. I'm Claire. That was my fault. Jonah said this might happen. Okay, do you just want me to go and see if they're outside? No, no, no, no, no, no. No. I'll go. I'll go. She lives right down the street. No, she's not answering. Uh... I don't know. Maybe she's on her way. You know what? Actually, I'm gonna go check and see if she's inside. Um, do you need anything? Do you want anything? - No. I'm fine. - Okay. - If a guy comes, will you get me an iced tea? - Sure. - Thank you so much for doing this, really. - Yeah, absolutely. I'll be right back. Look... Jonah has this place because, unfortunately, people try this stuff all the time. - We need a safe house. - How long do I have to be here? Oh, you don't have to be here at all, but I'll feel better knowing that it's safe. And when Jonah says that the... the bus is ready to leave, we'll just put you right back on it. We... we don't want you going into the next part of your journey with negative energy. That's why Jonah set this place up... for calming, relaxation, re-centering. Okay. Just stay here with Claire, and I'll make sure everything's okay, all right? Don't worry. Do you want to just relax or lie down? You can take a nap. I'm right here, okay? I'll be right here. Where did you get that camera? It looks like footage from the nose of a missile. Oh, it's a baby monitor. It was on sale. All right, what... what's the optical illusion for? It puts her subconscious mind at war with her conscious mind. It opens up an avenue for the trance state. And then within 10 minutes, the drum beat should put her hippocampal theta waves between 6 and 10 hertz, putting her right between awake and asleep and in a suggestive state. Probably the only state where any of this is legal. Oh. Thatagirl. Okay, it's hard to get a good reading through all the bedding, but it looks like her theta waves are down to 10. - Oh. I'm going in. - All right. Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. We have a very short window of time here before she passes through the suggestive state. Clark, Clark, the original goal was to get her away from Jonah. She's away. She's right here. Her brain is in your hands, Clark. Please, just make her want to go home. Take the win. She's at 8 hertz. Sofie, if you can hear my voice, just nod. Good. I want you to know that you are an independent person. You believe that. And when you wake up, you'll believe that if anyone tries to pull you in their direction or, like, talk you into an idea, you're strong enough to think for yourself, okay? Okay. Oh. This stone is strong and solid. And whenever you're confused or pressured, this stone will remind you that you're strong, too, and self-reliant, okay? Good. Okay. Uh... over and out. No. You'll wake up when I count to three. One... Two... I told you guys to make sure no outsiders get in the compound. And I told you to keep an eye on her. You got a phone? Okay, remember the script. Support her. Don't beg her to come home or try to pull her back. It'll work against you. Hello? Hi. I just... - I don't know. I wanted to call. - Good. I'm glad. Well, um... I just... I just want you to know that... Your dad and I love you. And... I know we weren't always perfect parents. We made a lot of mistakes. But just know that... The way you turned out... that... that isn't one of them. And we will always be your family. One of us on each side of you so you don't fall out. Ocean! Okay, bye. Sofie? Honey? Excuse me. Yeah? What happened?! What did she do? She got on the bus. How could you be happy with the outcome? I didn't say happy. I said satisfied. It's like a... a magic trick, where you looked like you were gonna saw the girl in half and then you actually sawed her in half. The plan worked. T... tell that to the dad who wants to sue us for the plan. I said I'd encourage her to take charge of her own life. Y... you gave her a pet rock and you sent her off - to live in a Mexican cult! - By her own choice! - What right do we have to... to make it... - What about obligation? What if somebody's about to choose to jump off a bridge? You know, in certain states, there are laws requiring that you help someone in trouble. We did try, Ross, which is why the father can't sue us, even if he wanted to. - We tried! - Please! I am so tired of this from everyone. Sometimes, we do know what's best for another person. And I am not gonna sit on my ass and do nothing. Oh, what are you gonna do, Ross? Go grab her and bring her back? You don't even know where she is. Down 55. I saw their map. She's a lot stronger than you think, Ross! She just needs to realize it! What did they do to you? Fill your head full of lies about me? About the movement? Try to make you doubt your commitment? No. They let me take a nap. And then they just let you walk? Yeah. They're up to something. And they accuse me of mind control? This is good, though. It means we're getting to them. It means we're winning. That's why you have to trust me. Filter out the noise, the voices that will pollute the message. It'll lead you back to the lie you were living before you came to me... the empty consumerism that was consuming you. Blend your voice with... Hey. What was the rock about? - Hmm? - The pet rock that you gave to Sofie. Oh, the talisman. A focusing agent. Our dependencies, our habits, our fears... they're all just tricks of the mind. Something as simple as a rock can remind the brain to tune out the tricks and turn on the truth. Where is she? Mom. Yes, sir. No, we're just very happy it all worked out. And we wish the best of luck to all of you. Sofie's dad just called to say thank you. He's sending the check. - Hello. - Hi. Congratulations. Hey. Where's Claire? Does she know about the good news? Yeah, she was the first one to take the call. Oh. Well, go get her so we can celebrate. Okay. Oh, yeah. I hired her back. - Why? - Uh, because you like her, and she wants to change. And, you know, if I didn't think people could change, I wouldn't be working with you. Yeah, so, Claire's... Not here. Clark. "You'll be okay. You are stronger and more capable than you think." Birds and snakes, man. What's that? It's my pet rock. - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com -
