  PREVIOUSLY ON "MIND GAMES"...
  THOSE PILLS REALLY LEVELED HIM.
 I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE HIM HIS NEXT DOSE.
  Ross: I'LL DO IT.
  UM, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT GETS DONE RIGHT.
  HE'S MY LITTLE BROTHER, AND I WANT TO DO IT.
  ART MEETS SCIENCE FICTION!
  WE COULD MOUNT AN EXHIBIT!
  PLEASE PULL OVER SO THAT I CAN DRIVE.
  [ HORN HONKS ] [ TIRES SCREECH ]
  NO! STOP!
  PLEASE PULL OVER SO THAT I CAN DRIVE.
  LOOK -- IN THE LIGHT OF -- OH, LOOK!
  IT IS LIKE A BACKLIT WHEEL OF CHEESE!
  ART MEETS SCIENCE FICTION!
  YEAH. NO, I KNOW THAT, BUT I-I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
  BRAIN TRAUMA CAN BE VERY HARD TO DETECT.
  HOW -- HOW DO WE KNOW THAT YOU -- YOU HAVEN'T MISSED SOMETHING?
  WELL, THE WHITE COAT USUALLY CLEARS UP THAT SORT OF CONFUSION.
  [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH, I KNOW, BUT --
  ANY HEADACHE? NO.
 UM...CAN I GO HOME NOW?
 YES.
  NO, NOT YET.
  IT'S A MILD
  CONCUSSION.
  THAT'S ALL.
  ACETAMINOPHEN FOR PAIN. REST.
  GOOD LUCK.
  HE SEEMED ARROGANT.
  LET'S JUST GET OUT OF HERE.
  DON'T SIT UP SO FAST!
  LET ME GO FIND YOU A WHEELCHAIR.
  I CAN WALK. I WON'T BE DRIVING.
  ...WHICH WAS A JOKE.
  Woman: OH, MY GOD!
  [ MAN CLEARS THROAT ] LOOK AT YOU!
  ARE YOU OKAY? I'M FINE, MOM.
  I'M FINE, MOM. Clark: IT'S A MINOR CONCUSSION.
  NO INTRACRANIAL BLEEDING... THAT WE'RE AWARE OF.
  THE POLICE SAID THE CAR'S TOTALED. THEY'RE SURPRISED YOU WALKED AWAY.
  MOM, DAD...THIS IS CLARK.
  HI. LET'S GET YOU HOME.
 OH, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TAKE HER
HOME, SO IF YOU GUYS WANT --
  YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? DAVID.
  YOU THINK I'D LET HER GET INTO A CAR WITH YOU AGAIN?
 I KNOW HOW YOU MUST FEEL. I'M MORTIFIED.
 I'VE BEEN GOING OVER THE EVENTS IN MY MIND, AND --
  BETH TOLD US ABOUT YOUR CONDITION.
  MY CONDITION?
  OH, MY CONDITION HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
  THIS -- THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT.
  I MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN A LITTLE EXCITED -- THE MOON,
  OR, MORE PARTICULARLY, T-T-THE WAY THAT THE MOON
  WAS HITTING HER FACE WAS PRETTY.
  I WAS TRYING TO TAKE A PICTURE.
  NOT SMART. I SHOULD KNOW BETTER.
  THE BIGGER POINT, THOUGH, IS I WAS ON MEDICATION.
  MY FOURTH DOSE OUT OF SEVEN, WHICH IS A TAPERING DOSE.
  IT BRINGS ME BACK TO WHERE -- HERE, NORMAL.
  THIS IS NORMAL?
  [ Chuckling ] OKAY, I SEE YOUR FACES.
  I KNOW, I TALK FAST --
  MAYBE A LITTLE FASTER WHEN I
FEEL LIKE MY GIRLFRIEND'S MOTHER
  WANTS TO PUNCH ME, BUT, AGAIN, THIS ISN'T ABOUT MY CONDITION.
  THIS IS, UH, YOU KNOW, I-I-I WAS FINE.
  FINE FOR ME.
  THIS WAS ABOUT A PICTURE.
  NO MORE PICTURES WHILE I'M DRIVING.
  I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. I'M DONE.
  I'M CLARK.
  DID I -- DID I SAY THAT?
  [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ]
  HEY. I'VE BEEN CALLING.
HOW'S BETH?
  UH, GOOD.
  UH, ACETAMINOPHEN, REST.
  WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU OKAY? MM-HMM.
  IF ANYONE ASKS
IF YOU'RE OKAY, DON'T SAY NO.
 SAY YOU DON'T KNOW. THEY
WRITE DOWN ANYTHING YOU SAY.
  WHAT -- WHAT ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT?
  INSURANCE. I'M FINE.
  OH. DON'T WE HAVE WORK TO DO?
  UH, CLIENT'S DUE IN 15 MINUTES.
  WELL, SHOULDN'T YOU BE WITH BETH?
  HER PARENTS SHOWED UP. SHE'S...WITH THEM, SO...
  DON'T -- JUST CALL ME WHEN THE...CLIENT GETS HERE.
  I'M GONNA BE IN HERE.
  HEY.
  [ SIGHS ]
  I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN HELP SOMEONE WHO MADE A MISTAKE.
 WE DO REQUIRE THAT YOU BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC
  ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED.
  RIGHT.
  I'M HAVING AN AFFAIR.
  I'M NOT PROUD OF IT.
  THAT'D BE WEIRD IF YOU WERE.
 [ CHUCKLES ] AND I WANT TO END IT.
  O-OR I WANT YOU TO HELP ME END IT.
 YOU WANT US TO STICK A NOTE
IN HER LOCKER FOR YOU?
  [ SCOFFS ] IF ONLY IT WERE THAT EASY.
  UGH, IT'S JUST ALL SO CLICHÃ©.
 YOU KNOW, I-IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT WHEN IT'S HAPPENING TO YOU.
  YOU KNOW, YOU THINK THAT YOUR STORY IS DIFFERENT.
  I WASN'T LOOKING FOR THIS. I-I-IT JUST --
  BIOLOGICALLY SPEAKING, WE'RE NOT REALLY SUITED FOR MONOGAMY.
  DOPAMINE, OXYTOCIN, VASOPRESSIN --
  THESE ARE CHEMICALS THAT FLOOD YOUR SYSTEM
  WHEN YOU FALL FOR SOMEONE,
  AND THEY KEEP YOU ATTACHED FOR THE LONG HAUL.
  THE PROBLEM IS, LONG HAUL -- FOUR TO SEVEN YEARS.
  THAT'S WHEN YOUR BODY STOPS PRODUCING THESE CHEMICALS
  IN RESPONSE TO YOUR MATE.
  THAT'S WHERE THE TERM SEVEN-YEAR ITCH COMES FROM.
  IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN'T FIRE UP THE HORMONAL ENGINES AGAIN.
  IT JUST TAKES CARE, EFFORT, MAINTENANCE, WORK.
  AND IF, INSTEAD OF THE WORK, WHAT YOU DO
  IS RUN INTO SOMEONE NEW
  WHO STARTS THAT FLOOD OF CHEMICALS,
  YOU SUDDENLY FEEL LIKE A TEENAGER ALL OVER AGAIN.
  EXACTLY. I'M -- IT'S LIKE BEING ON DRUGS.
  YOU ARE ON DRUGS!
  BUT T-T-THE DRUGS ARE COMING FROM INSIDE THE BODY, NOT OUT,
  AND, JUST LIKE DRUGS, YOU NEED THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN
  UNTIL YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE LYING ON A DIRTY MATTRESS
  IN A NEUROBIOLOGICAL CRACK DEN.
  CAN'T YOU JUST SAY, "ADDICTED"?
  AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
  YOU HAVE COMPLETELY WRECKED YOUR LIFE.
  I'M STILL NOT SURE WHERE WE COME IN.
  M-M-MY STORY MAY BE A CLICHÃ©,
  BUT THESE WOMEN ARE NOT.
  LOOK, OKAY, JANE --
  SHE'S THE ONE I'M HAVING THE AFFAIR WITH --
  SHE -- SHE'S AMAZING,
  AND ANNIE -- ANNIE'S MY WIFE.
  YOU KNOW, SHE'S... SHE'S EVERYTHING TO ME.
  I JUST... I FORGOT THAT FOR A MOMENT.
  THE POINT IS, THESE WOMEN DO NOT DESERVE
  TO HAVE EVERYTHING END IN A MUSHROOM CLOUD
  BECAUSE I ACTED LIKE AN IDIOT.
  NOW, I-I-IF I JUST WANTED OUT, I WOULDN'T NEED YOU GUYS.
  I-I'D NEED AN ATTORNEY.
  WHAT I WANT IS TO STAY
  AND FOR EVERYONE TO BE FINE.
  WHAT I WANT IS EXACTLY WHAT THESE STORIES NEVER HAVE,
  IS...A HAPPY ENDING.
  CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THAT?
  YOU WANT US TO WHAT, NOW?
  MAKE A WOMAN FALL OUT OF LOVE.
  YOU MEAN, "HELP A GUY GET AWAY WITH CHEATING."
 THERE'S A SCIENTIFIC
BASIS FOR PHILANDERING,
AND WE SHOULD --
  HAVE YOU EVER BEEN CHEATED ON?
NO.
  WELL, IF YOU ARE AND THEY TELL YOU IT'S JUST EVOLUTION,
  I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO BEAT 'EM TO DEATH
  WITH A STATUE OF DARWIN.
  Clark: THINK ABOUT IT --
  THE CHALLENGE OF MAKING SOMEONE FALL OUT OF LOVE.
  OH, SO YOU JUST WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN?
  NO! A LITTLE BIT.
  [ SIGHS ]
WE WANT TO HELP A GUY.
  I HAVE TO VOTE NO.
 WHEN DID WE START VOTING? WE DON'T VOTE.
  OH. Ross: I'VE MADE MISTAKES
  THAT I'D LOVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDO.
  HAVEN'T WE ALL?
  THIS GUY, ALLEN, HE SCREWED UP.
  HE DID THE WRONG THING, NOW HE'S TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT ONE.
  YOU WANT TO TELL HIM, "TOO BAD. THROW YOUR DIVORCE ON THE PILE
  WITH THE OTHER 50% OF MARRIAGES"?
  HE'S PULLED THE PIN ON A LIVE GRENADE.
  WE CAN EITHER HELP HIM PUT IT BACK IN
  OR WATCH EVERYONE GET BLOWN TO BITS.
  Clark: THAT'S A VERY GRAPHIC EXAMPLE.
  THANK YOU. I'M IN. I NEED SOME COFFEE.
 I'M NOT SURE HE DOES.
  WHAT HAPPENED AT THE HOSPITAL?
  NOTHING. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
  I'M FINE. [ SCOFFS ]
  WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE FINE,
  THAT'S ALWAYS THE FIRST SIGN THAT THINGS ARE NOT FINE.
 LOOK, THEY HATE ME, ROSS.
  BOTH HER MOM AND DAD WANT TO PUNCH ME,
  AND WHEN A MOM WANTS
TO PUNCH YOU, IT'S NOT --
  LOOK, LOOK, THERE'S NO GOOD WAY
 TO MEET YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S
PARENTS IN A HOSPITAL.
 E.R., MATERNITY WARD --
IT JUST CAN'T BE DONE.
  THEY'LL COME AROUND.
  LOOK, I-IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY HATE ME.
  THEY THINK THIS -- THIS IS ALL BECAUSE I'M BIPOLAR.
  AND -- AND LOOK, YOU WERE THERE!
  I TOOK MY MEDS! YOU WATCHED ME TAKE MY MEDS.
  I JUST GOT EXCITED, I GRABBED BETH'S PHONE,
  I TOOK A PICTURE AND [ IMITATES CRASH ]
 LOOK, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
  THAT'S WHAT I SAID!
  MAYBE A LITTLE LONGER AND LOUDER THAN THAT,
  BUT BASICALLY THAT.
  WAIT.
  I'LL PROVE IT TO THEM.
  I'LL SHOW THEM THE MEDICAL LITERATURE.
  I'LL WALK THEM THROUGH HOW WE CAME UP WITH THE DRUG PROTOCOL I'M ON.
  I'LL SHOW THEM MY JOURNALS,
  T-THE STUDIES ON FUNCTIONAL HYPOMANIA VERSUS MANIA.
  YOU COULD BE A CHARACTER WITNESS!
  EVERYONE COULD BE!
  CLARK, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S REALLY THE WAY TO --
  BLOOD!
  BLOOD?
  I CAN PROVE I WAS ON MY MEDS!
  THE HOSPITAL DREW MY BLOOD!
  CLARK, WAIT.
  WHAT'S HAPPENING? OH.
  I-I'M GOING TO SHOW BETH'S PARENTS MY BLOOD.
  EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.
 DO WE GET CONCERNED NOW
OR WAIT UNTIL HE WANTS
TO SEND THEM AN EAR?
  [ Telephone ringing ] HEY!
  YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.
  ROSS, BETH'S PARENTS NEED TO UNDERSTAND --
 NO, WHAT THEY NEED IS
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH
YOU, JUST LIKE BETH DID.
  YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
INVITED TO CHRISTMAS DINNER
  BY WAVING BLOOD IN THEIR FACE.
 YOU NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE
 OTHER THAN THE ACCIDENT.
  BUT THEY THINK I'M CRAZY!
  THEN CHANGE THE CONVERSATION.
 I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH DAMAGE CONTROL,
 GETTING PEOPLE TO FOCUS
ON MY GOOD QUALITIES,
  AS OPPOSED
TO MY CONSIDERABLE BAD ONES.
 YOU'RE IN MY WHEELHOUSE NOW. LET ME HELP YOU. HOW?
  YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO FOR OUR CLIENT,
  I'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO FOR YOU,
  AND IT'S HAPPY ENDINGS ALL AROUND.
  I THINK THAT PHRASE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.
 I REALIZED THAT THE MOMENT
IT CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH.
  THANK YOU.
 IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.
  Miles: WHAT ABOUT PHEROMONES?
  IF WE WANT THE GIRLFRIEND TO LOSE INTEREST IN ALLEN,
  WE JUST CREATE STRONG NEGATIVE ASSOCIATIONS USING HIS PHEROMONES.
  IF THIS IS GONNA INVOLVE SOMEHOW COLLECTING
  BUCKETS OF THIS GUY'S SWEAT, I'M CALLING IN SICK THAT DAY.
  HEY, MISTER. YES?
  GO WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT WITH A HEALTHY JOLT OF CLEAN!
  [ CHUCKLES ]
  YOU'RE A PSYCHOLOGIST. ANY IDEAS?
  YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE NEW JOLT MOUTHWASH GIRL!
 YEAH! SHUT UP!
  THAT'S FANTASTIC! WOW!
  WHY IS IT FANTASTIC?
  IT'S A NATIONAL COMMERCIAL! [ LAUGHS ]
  Sam: CONGRATULATIONS, MS. MOUTHWASH.
  OH, EXCUSE ME -- VITAMIN-INFUSED MOUTHWASH.
  THAT'S GREAT. CONGRATULATIONS.
  UH, MILES, YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT PHEROMONES?
  [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] Miles: OH, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
  THEY'RE NOT STRONG ENOUGH -- WE ACTUALLY WOULD NEED
  BUCKETS OF THEM FOR IT TO WORK.
  OOH! SORRY. UM...IT'S MY AGENT.
  [ LAUGHS ] I GOTTA TAKE THIS.
  OKAY, WELL, UM, HOW ABOUT --
 I GOT IT! PERFECT! LOOK!
  WE SMASH HER BRAIN IN.
  OLD-SCHOOL, BUT EFFECTIVE.
  NO. LOOK. LOVE/HATE CIRCUIT, OKAY?
  NEUROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES SHOW THAT LOVE AND HATE
  BASICALLY SHARE THE SAME AREA OF THE BRAIN --
  THE PUTAMEN AND THE INSULA IN THE SUBCORTEX, RIGHT HERE.
  SO THERE REALLY IS A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE.
  YES, BUT WHEN THE CIRCUIT IS SWITCHED TO "LOVE,"
  JUDGMENT -- FSSHT! -- DEACTIVATED.
  "STUPID IN LOVE," RIGHT? RIGHT.
  HATE MAKES US MORE RATIONAL --
  SHREWDER ANALYSTS OF OUR OWN SELF-INTEREST.
  SO WE JUST SWITCH OFF HER LOVE?
 IT'S NOT QUITE THAT EASY.
SHE'S NOT A HAIR DRYER.
  HAIR DRYER'S MORE OF A HIGH/LOW THING.
  WHAT YOU MEAN IS MORE LIKE A FOOD PROCESSOR,
  LIKE, DIFFERENT SPEEDS, LIKE, SLICE AND CHOP --
  LESS ABOUT SMALL APPLIANCES
  AND MORE ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO.
  Miles: EVERY TIME WE SEE THE ONE THAT WE LOVE,
 OUR BRAIN GETS DRENCHED
IN THE CHEMICALS OF ATTRACTION.
 BUT THAT'S AUTOMATIC. WE CAN'T STOP IT.
  UNLESS WE STOP TRIGGERING THE LOVE CIRCUIT ALTOGETHER
  BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO TRIGGERS IT...
  ISN'T WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE.
  ABHORRENCE PRIMING
THROUGH TRUST EROSION.
  WHOA!
  [ LAUGHS ]
  THIS TIME IN ENGLISH.
  YOU WANT JANE TO THINK I'M A BAD PERSON?
  A DIFFERENT PERSON. WHO'S BAD?
  IT'S THE FASTEST WAY.
  ROSS, CLAIRE FELL OUT OF LOVE WITH YOU, RIGHT?
  UH, YEAH.
  DID SHE TELL YOU WHY?
  SHE...SAID
SHE DIDN'T KNOW ME ANYMORE.
  HER BRAIN STOPPED ASSOCIATING HIM WITH ANYTHING GOOD.
  I WOULDN'T SAY "ANYTHING."
  OKAY, AND HOW DID SHE REACH THIS STATE?
 SHE STOPPED TRUSTING ME.
  TRUST IS A BIG PART OF LOVE.
  YOU TAKE AWAY TRUST AND LOVE'S GONNA GO WITH IT.
  SO, HOW DO WE MAKE HER NOT TRUST ME?
  ROSS? SERIOUSLY?
  AM I THE ONLY BAD EXAMPLE HERE?
  YOU'RE CERTAINLY THE MOST RELIABLE ONE.
  WE'RE GONNA MAKE HER THINK THAT YOU'RE A CON MAN.
  IF WE JUST TELL HER THAT YOU'RE BAD, SHE'S NOT GONNA BELIEVE US.
  WE TEND TO TRUST OUR OWN JUDGMENTS,
  AND WE NEED MULTIPLE FORMS OF CORROBORATION TO OVERCOME THEM.
  WE ACTIVATE HER CURIOSITY. [ TIRES SCREECH ]
  WHAT IS THIS?
HELLO, JANE.
 WE BUILD INTRIGUE
ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR.
  TELL ME
ABOUT RICHARD BRADEN.
  YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUY. THAT'S ALLEN CARMICHAEL.
  THAT'S WHAT HE'S GOING BY NOW. "NOW"?
  AND THEN ANYTHING THAT SHE LEARNS ABOUT YOU "ON HER OWN"
 IS GONNA BE MUCH MORE CONVINCING IN HER MIND.
  THIS, UM, ALLEN CARMICHAEL --
  HE'S NEVER DISCUSSED KINGSTON HOLDINGS,
 ALSO KNOWN AS GHR LIMITED,
ALSO KNOWN AS RenCorp?
  NO.
  WELL, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS WEBSITE.
 IF IT JOGS YOUR MEMORY
AND YOU WANT TO TALK,
YOU'VE GOT MY CARD.
  [ CAR DOOR CLOSES ] [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ]
  Latrell: HOW LONG TILL SHE BITES?
  SOON.
 CURIOSITY AND FEAR ARE
FAIRLY RELIABLE MOTIVATORS.
  [ KEYBOARD CLACKING ]
  OH! LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A HIT. Ross: HEY.
  AND...IT IS THE SAME I.P. ADDRESS AS HER E-MAILS.
  IT'S JANE.
OKAY, PERFECT. CALL ALLEN.
  TELL HIM NO MATTER
HOW MANY TIMES JANE CALLS,
 NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
SHE TEXTS, NOT TO ANSWER.
 WE NEED HER TO SPIN ON THIS FOR A WHILE.
  Miles: OKAY, THEN.
  WE COULD USE THIS TIME TO MASSAGE OUR PLAN
  TO HELP CLARK ON THE "BETH'S PARENTS" FRONT.
  WAIT.
YOU GOT MILES INVOLVED NOW?
  A HAPPY CLARK IS IN ALL OUR BEST INTERESTS.
  [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] ROSS, YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?
  UH, YEAH. LET'S GO INTO MY OFFICE.
  MOUTHWASH?
  VITAMIN-INFUSED ENERGY MOUTHWASH.
  I CAN'T LOSE YOU TO VITAMIN-INFUSED ENERGY MOUTHWASH.
  LOSE ME? IT'S A NATIONAL COMMERCIAL, MEGAN.
  IF YOU'RE POPPING UP ACROSS AMERICA
  WITH ENERGIZED TEETH AND GUMS,
  I CAN'T VERY WELL SEND YOU OUT TO PRETEND TO BE
  WHATEVER CLARK AND MILES COME UP WITH.
  OH. EXACTLY.
  UH, WELL, SO, WHAT DO WE DO?
  TURN IT DOWN.
 TURN IT DOWN? IT'S MOUTHWASH.
 I BEAT OUT 6,000 OTHER GIRLS FOR THE PART, ROSS.
  TO DO WHAT, SPIT IN A SINK ON TV?
  THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF YOUR ACTING CAREER?
 A LOT OF ACTORS GOT THEIR START IN COMMERCIALS.
  YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS, MEGAN.
  GET A PART IN "MOUTHWASH, THE MOVIE,"
  I WILL BUY YOU A SAFE TO KEEP YOUR OSCAR IN,
  BUT WE GOT A GREAT THING GOING HERE.
  DON'T THROW IT AWAY FOR THIS.
  GREAT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
  WHOA. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
  HOME.
  THE COMMERCIAL SHOOT STARTS TOMORROW.
  SO, YOU'RE JUST GONNA TAKE THAT JOB
  AND DITCH THIS ONE, JUST LIKE THAT?
 NO. NOT JUST LIKE THAT.
  UH, AFTER I GO HOME, I'M GONNA CHANGE,
 AND THEN I'M GONNA GO OUT
WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY
  WHO WANT TO BUY ME DINNER AND DRINKS
  BECAUSE THEY'RE PROUD OF ME.
  AND THEIR REACTION
TO HEARING THAT SOMETHING
  FINALLY BROKE MY WAY
WAS TO WANT TO CELEBRATE,
  NOT HAUL ME IN HERE
AND MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A JOKE.
  MEGAN, THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT --
 YOU COULD HAVE JUST SAID,
"YOU'RE FIRED," ROSS.
  THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN KINDER.
  HERE'S OUR CENTRAL PROBLEM.
 THAT YOUR PEP TALK
WITH MEGAN SENT HER
FLYING OUT THE DOOR,
 SO MAYBE YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
TO BE GIVING US A LECTURE
 ON HOW TO STRAIGHTEN OUT
CLARK'S PERSONAL LIFE.
  SHE CAN'T DO BOTH JOBS. I WAS TRYING TO INSPIRE HER --
 TO CLEAR OUT HER DESK WITH A BULLDOZER?
  CAN I FIX ONE DISASTER AT A TIME, PLEASE?
  CLARK WAS ON THE DOCKET FIRST.
  NOW, LOOK, WHEN SOMEONE BRINGS UP MY SECURITIES FRAUD,
  I'VE LEARNED THAT IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE
  TO TALK ABOUT HOW I WAS ONLY CONVICTED
  ON 6 OF THE 12 COUNTS.
  BRINGING IT UP NOW, THOUGH, IS GREAT.
  MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M IN GOOD HANDS.
  MM. Sam: HEY, SORRY.
  HEY, LOOK WHO DECIDED TO SHOW UP.
  SORRY I'M LATE.
  THAT STUPID PIECE OF CRAP CAR I WAS BORROWING
  BROKE DOWN ON WACKER DRIVE. OH.
 W-W-- SHOULDN'T YOU BE
MAKING YOURSELF AVAILABLE
 IF JANE WANTS TO CALL INSTEAD OF -- DING-DONG.
  RELAX. WE'RE ON IT.
  I MEAN, Y-YOU SAID THAT SHE NEEDED TO SPIN ON THINGS FOR A WHILE.
  NOW, LET US DO OUR WORK HERE.
  NOW, BETH HAS MANAGED TO CONVINCE HER PARENTS
  TO HAVE DINNER WITH YOU TONIGHT -- A SECOND CHANCE AT A FIRST IMPRESSION.
  HOW'D SHE -- SHE CONVINCED THEM
  THAT THEY NEEDED TO GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER.
  AND WHAT WE WANT THEM TO KNOW BETTER...
  IS THIS.
  'CAUSE RIGHT NOW, ALL THEY KNOW
  IS THAT YOU'RE BIPOLAR AND CRASHED YOUR CAR.
 PLENTY OF PEOPLE ARE HIGHLY
FUNCTIONAL DESPITE THEIR --
  THIS IS WHY I NEED
TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT I'M --
  BIPOLAR AND CRASHED YOUR CAR?
 I DON'T PLAN ON PHRASING IT IN THAT WAY.
 THEY DO PLAN ON
HEARING IT THAT WAY.
  AND UNTIL YOU CONVINCE THEM THAT YOU'RE ALSO
  A CHARMING GENIUS WHO LOVES THEIR DAUGHTER,
 THEY'LL NEVER SEE ANY OF THE BAD STUFF IN ANY KIND OF CONTEXT.
  LIKE FIRING MEGAN BUT TRYING TO PUT IT
  IN THE CONTEXT
OF CLAIMING YOU DIDN'T. LATRELL, SHE CHOSE --
  Clark: THEY'RE GONNA BRING UP THE ACCIDENT.
  IT'S THE ELEPHANT IN THE... CRUMPLED SEDAN.
  THEY CAN BRING UP WHATEVER THEY WANT.
  BETH AND YOU...WILL JUST
  KEEP FOLLOWING THE ARROWS RIGHT BACK TO HOME BASE.
  [ As Beth's mother ] HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN BIPOLAR,
  EVIL, AND DERANGED, DR. CLARK?
  [ As Clark ] AROUND THE TIME THAT I WON
  MY FIRST SIX-FIGURE RESEARCH GRANT.
  DID, UH, I MENTION HOW NICE YOUR HAIR LOOKS
  AND I JUST BOUGHT YOUR DAUGHTER A SWEATER?
  JUST IMAGINE A HUGE SCOREBOARD IN THE RESTAURANT.
  EVERY MINUTE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ACCIDENT,
  THEY'RE SCORING.
  EVERY MINUTE YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE SCORING.
  HIGH SCORE WINS.
  THIS IS REALLY INFANTILIZING.
  WANT US TO SLOW DOWN FOR YOU?
  Miles: ADDITIONALLY, WE CAN PRIME THEM
  SO THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE COMING IN
 WITH SOME PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS ABOUT YOU,
 WE'RE ABLE TO GET THEM TO OVERCOME THEM.
  FOR EXAMPLE,
DON'T ORDER LIGHT AT DINNER.
  BREAK THE BANK.
KEEP THE COURSES COMING.
 RESEARCH SHOWS US THAT WE'RE MORE LIKELY
 TO ASSOCIATE POSITIVE FEELINGS
WITH THINGS AND PEOPLE
  THAT WE EXPERIENCE WHILE WE'RE EATING.
 ALSO, MIRROR HER FATHER.
 DELAY AND REPEAT SOME OF HIS
GESTURES, HIS MANNERISMS.
  WE INSTINCTIVELY LIKE PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES.
  WE'RE EATING THE SAME THING.
  SAMENESS BIAS. I SHOULD HAVE --
  WHY DIDN'T I COME UP WITH THAT?
  DADDY, HOW'S YOUR GOLF GAME? I LOVE GOLF.
  YOU PLAY GOLF?
 WHAT'S YOUR HANDICAP?
  LOUSY HAND-EYE COORDINATION.
  [ LAUGHTER ]
  HONESTLY, IT'D BE A LOT LOWER IF MY ACADEMIC CAREER
  DIDN'T TAKE OFF THE WAY IT DID, BUT... OH.
  Clark: MR. AND MRS. SCOTT, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DINNER,
  WHICH IS MY TREAT, BY THE WAY.
NO! COULDN'T DO THAT.
  ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE SECOND CHANCE.
  [ CHUCKLES ]
  SEE? I KNEW IF WE SPENT SOME TIME TOGETHER,
  YOU GUYS WOULD SEE THE CLARK I SEE.
  HE'S IMPRESSIVE. DRIVING RECORD ASIDE.
  [ CHUCKLES ]
 YOU KNOW, UH, BETH AND I
  W-WENT TO
A-A FASCINATING LECTURE --
  YOU KNOW, HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT...HIRING A DRIVER?
  I-I MEAN, WITH YOUR CONDITION --
 BY "CONDITION," DO YOU MEAN
  "POORLY TIMED DESIRE TO SNAP A PHOTO"?
  CLARK -- SMARTPHONE USAGE IS --
  IS ONE OF THE LEADING, UH, CAUSES OF CATASTROPHIC --
  DO WE REALLY HAVE TO GET INTO THIS?
  WELL, IT IS WHY WE'RE IN TOWN.
  I MEAN, WHY CAN'T WE TALK ABOUT IT?
  LET'S STOP SKIRTING THE ISSUE.
  WELL -- TH-- [SIGHS]
THE ISSUE ISN'T THE ISSUE.
  OR -- OR AT LEAST I-IT ISN'T THE --
 IT ISN'T THE ISSUE THAT... [ SIGHS ]
  YOU -- HOLD ON. YOU KNOW...
  LET ME, UM...
  I'LL SHOW YOU THE PHOTO THAT IS... THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
  ...SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR --
LOOK, IF YOU'RE
SUGGESTING THAT
 A PHOTO OF A MOONLIT NIGHT IS SOMEHOW WORTH --
  NO, I'M SUGGESTING THAT --
  THAT "STUPID" ISN'T THE SAME AS "CRAZY."
  I VERY WELL MAY HAVE BEEN STUPID,
  BUT I CERTAINLY WASN'T -- CLARK, PLEASE DON'T. YOU DON'T --
  IT'S -- THIS IS A VIDEO. OH.
  I MUST HAVE -- I MUST HAVE PUSHED THE --
  THAT'S FINE.
IT'S EVEN BETTER. HERE.
  JUST... GO AHEAD AND...
  OOH, LOOK! UH, LOOK AT THE MOON!
  IT IS LIKE A BACKLIT WHEEL OF CHEESE!
WILL YOU PLEASE SLOW DOWN?
  ART MEETS SCIENCE FICTION! NO, NO! CLARK, PLEASE!
  OHHHHH! WE COULD MOUNT AN EXHIBIT AT THE OFFICE!
 PULL OVER NOW. YOU
ARE STILL RECOVERING
FROM THE VERY SER--
  [ HORN HONKS ] [ CRASHING ]
  COULD'VE HAPPENED TO ANYBODY?
 WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
  I JUST REALLY WANTED US TO HAVE A NICE EVENING.
  WELL, MAYBE NOW YOU WILL.
  HEY. NO, NO, NO, NO.
  [ SIGHS ] I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
  I -- I -- [ PANTING ]
  I THOUGHT -- I REALLY...
  I'M SORRY.
  Ross: HEY.
YOU DIDN'T RETURN MY CALLS.
  WHICH I DO HAPPEN TO KNOW, SINCE I'M THE ONE WHO GOT THEM.
 WELL, YOU DIDN'T RETURN
BETH'S CALLS, EITHER.
  UH, WHICH YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW, UNLESS THIS WHOLE
  DOMESTIC-SURVEILLANCE THING IS A LOT WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.
 SHE'S CALLING ME, CLARK. ME. WE HAD A PLAN!
  OKAY. THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT.
  DIDN'T WORK, SO I-I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.
  WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? UH, LOOK, I TRIED IT YOUR WAY.
  DIDN'T WORK. IS EVERYTHING OKAY WITH --
  OKAY, EVERYBODY, STOP! GOT IT! THANK YOU!
  APPRECIATE IT! GOOD JOB!
  THIS IS MY PROBLEM! MY PERSONAL LIFE!
  MY CAR CRASH! MY VOICE RAMBLING ON THE VIDEO.
  WE CAN STILL -- ME! MINE!
  HANDLING IT. ME. ALONE.
  ALL RIGHT, NEW TOPIC. ALLEN.
  ALLEN'S MISTRESS HAS HAD ALL NIGHT
  TO CONSIDER OUR REVELATIONS.
  DOES ANYONE KNOW IF SHE'S CALLED SAM?
NO, ACTUALLY, SHE DIDN'T.
 WELL, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
 SHE SHOULD BE WRESTLING
WITH A SERIOUS NEED
 FOR CONFIRMATION
OR COUNTERVAILING EVIDENCE --
 WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO? Ross: WHAT'S WRONG?
 SHE CAME TO MY OFFICE. OH, THAT'S GREAT!
  NOT GREAT.
  NO, I -- I CAN'T
JUST KEEP DODGING HER,
 AND NOW THIS THING IS
THREATENING TO PLAY OUT
IN FRONT OF MY CO-WORKERS.
  LOOK, S-SHE'S LOOKING FOR WAYS TO BELIEVE YOU,
  EVEN IN THE FACE OF THE EVIDENCE.
  SHE NEEDS TO JUSTIFY HER CHOICE TO BE WITH YOU.
  WHERE'D YOU GUYS LEAVE IT? SHE ASKED TO MEET FOR COFFEE LATER.
  THAT'S G-GREAT!
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT
  ABOUT THINGS
THAT SEEM THE OPPOSITE. ALLEN, ALLEN, ALLEN,
  WE'RE TRYING TO CLEAN UP YOUR MESS HERE, PAL.
  JUST HAVE A LITTLE FAITH THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.
  AT COFFEE TODAY, DENY ANY ACCUSATIONS.
  THIS WILL CAUSE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE IN HER BRAIN
  AS SHE TRIES TO RECONCILE WHAT SHE HEARS
  AGAINST THE EVIDENCE THAT SHE'S SEEN,
  UNRAVELING HER BELIEF THAT YOU ARE WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE.
  SO, NO MATTER WHAT SHE ASKS ABOUT RICHARD BRADEN, KINGSTON,
  ANYTHING, DENY, DENY, DENY.
  DON'T EXPLAIN ANYTHING.
 I CAN'TEXPLAIN ANYTHING.
  YES! JUST LIKE THAT.
  SO, YOU'RE DENYING IT?
  YES. THAT'S...
  [ INHALES DEEPLY ] I'M DENYING IT.
  WELL, YOUR PICTURE... IS ON THE WEBSITE.
  I SAW IT. SO, HOW CAN YOU SAY --
  IT'S EASY TO STEAL A PICTURE.
  [ GASPS ] SEE HER SPACE-MAXIMIZATION MOVEMENTS?
  THIS IS -- THIS IS GREAT. YOU DO SAY THAT ABOUT THINGS THAT AREN'T.
 HER MATE-VALUE SIGNALS ARE SHUT DOWN.
 SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE WITH HIM.
  HEY! LOOK!
  JUST GIVE ME A THUMBS-UP OR A THUMBS-DOWN.
  I WANT YOU TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON!
  I...DON'T KNOW.
  [ SIGHS ]
  [ CELLPHONE VIBRATING ]
  UH-OH.
  I JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND.
  NO! NO, NOT --
  NOT INTERSEXUAL TOUCHING AND OPEN-BODY POSITIONS.
  ANYTHING BUT INTERSEXUAL...
  THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY THAT WE CAN FIX THIS.
  WHAT HAPPENED -- WHY ISN'T SHE MAXIMIZING
  THAT THING SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE MAXIMIZING?
  SHE SAW THE WEBSITE.
SHE TALKED TO THE AGENT.
 I -- HOW IS SHE NOT PUTTING
A FORK THROUGH HIS EYE?
  BECAUSE WHEN YOU WANT SOMETHING NOT TO BE TRUE,
  YOU'LL GRASP AT ANY STRAW.
  YOU'LL TRY OUT ANY THEORY, OVERTURN ANY ROCK FOR EVIDENCE
  THAT YOU WEREN'T WRONG.
  THE INSTINCT TO LOOK PAST THE TRUTH --
  IT'S...IT'S NATURAL.
  CLARK, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'LL MEET YOU BACK AT THE OFFICE.
  NO, CLARK --
  [ SIGHS ]
  HI. HI.
 IS DR. KRANDALL HERE?
  HE'S OFF UNTIL THURSDAY. CAN I HELP YOU?
  [ Sighing ] UH, I HOPE SO.
  [ CLEARS THROAT ]
  UM...MY NAME IS, UH, CLARK EDWARDS.
 I WAS HERE FRIDAY NIGHT
AFTER A CAR ACCIDENT.
  UM...DR. KRANDALL DREW SOME BLOOD,
 AND I WAS WONDERING
IF IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE
TO SCREEN THE SAMPLE.
  THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A TOX SCREEN.
  IT WOULDN'T SHOW UP ON THAT.
  [ SIGHS ]
  RISPERIDONE?
  I'VE HAD A PROTOCOL
THAT HAS WORKED UP UNTIL NOW,
  BUT OBVIOUSLY, HERE
IT FAILED CATASTROPHICALLY.
 I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG.
  I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO START.
  LET ME SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.
  THANK YOU.
  [ SIGHS ]
  I CAN'T SAY THIS.
  I MEAN, JANE WOULD NEVER BELIEVE THAT I SAID THIS.
  THAT'S WHY
WE'RE RECORDING IT --
 TO CONVINCE JANE THAT
NOT ONLY YOU WOULD DO IT,
 BUT YOU DID DO IT. [ SIGHS ]
  [ BEEP ]
  "THE, UH, STUFF IS F-FLYING OFF THE SHELF THIS WEEK."
  WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. SLIMY. MEAN.
  I-I TOLD YOU, I'M NOT SLIMY. I'M NOT MEAN.
  SO? HUGH JACKMAN IS NOT WOLVERINE.
  OH, HE IS TO ME.
SHE NEEDS TO BE CONVINCED
 THAT YOU'RE
AN IRREDEEMABLE CROOK --
 A COMPLETE ASS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE.
  ROSS, SHOW HIM. HEY!
  THAT WAS SAM. JANE CALLED HER.
 SHE'S READY TO MEET. PERFECT.
  WE SHOULD BE DONE BY THE TIME SAM GETS HERE.
  SHE CAN THEN --
EXCEPT SAM'S STUCK.
  WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "STUCK"? SHE TOOK THE TRAIN,
 AND THERE'S SOMETHING WITH RED-LINE TRACKS
  BETWEEN ADDISON AND BELMONT. FINE, FINE, FINE.
  I-I-I'LL DO THE MEETING. Clark: NO.
  JANE IS PRIMED TO SEE MEN AS UNTRUSTWORTHY RIGHT NOW.
  IF WE WANT THIS TO WORK,
  THEN SHE HAS TO FEEL SAFE AND SECURE
  WITH WHOEVER DOES THE PRESENTATION.
  BUT IT HAS TO BE A FEMALE.
  IT'S A SHAME YOU RAN OFF THAT LOVELY GIRL
  WHO USED TO WORK HERE. [ SIGHS ] I TOLD YOU,
  I WAS TRYING TO KEEP HER FROM --
  FORGET IT.
  LOOK, I'LL FIND MEGAN. I'LL GET HER TO DO IT.
  HOW? I DON'T KNOW, LATRELL.
  IT'LL PROBABLY START WITH, "I'M SORRY,"
  AND END WITH A REALLY LARGE CHECK.
  YOU GUYS JUST WORRY ABOUT GETTING THAT TAPE.
  OKAY. THAT'S YOUR CUE.
  "THE STUFF'S FLYING OFF THE SHELF THIS WEEK.
  WE MIGHT WANT TO SLOW DOWN THE SUPPLY."
  "WHY, YOU AFRAID
OF GETTING TOO RICH?"
  [ LAUGHS ] "MAYBE. I BLAME THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT."
  "HOW'S THAT?"
  "MORE AND MORE WEALTH IN THE HANDS OF THE ELDERLY.
  "IT'S LIKE BEING SURROUNDED BY LOW-HANGING FRUIT.
  "THEIR HANDS MAY SHAKE, BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO STOP THEM
  FROM SIGNING AWAY THEIR SAVINGS." [ LAUGHS ]
  [ BEEP ] OH, MY GOD.
  I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.
  NO.
HE FOOLED SO MANY PEOPLE...
  PEOPLE
WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER.
  I'M NOT SOME INVESTOR, AGENT REED.
  I WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR. [ LAUGHS ]
  I NEVER WANTED TO BE THAT PERSON.
  OH, MY GOD. I'M SO STUPID.
  AND HORRIBLE.
  JANE, STOP. YOU GOT FOOLED.
 WE THOUGHT YOU'D KNOW ENOUGH
TO HELP US, BUT IT'S CLEAR
NOW THAT YOU DON'T,
 SO RATHER THAN GET MIXED UP
IN WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN...
  GET THIS GUY OUT OF YOUR LIFE.
  YOU DESERVE BETTER.
  I'M NOT SURE I DO. I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.
  LOOK AT WHAT I'VE DONE.
  LOOK, JANE...
 I'VE BEEN THE OTHER WOMAN.
 I'M ASHAMED TO ADMIT IT, BUT IT'S TRUE.
  BUT HERE'S THE THING
I LEARNED THE HARD WAY.
  I'M NOBODY'S OTHER ANYTHING.
 EITHER I AM THE ONE...
  OR HE'S NOT.
 YOU WALK AWAY REMEMBERING THAT,
MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
  WHO ACTUALLY ENDS UP
BETTER OFF AFTER ALL THIS.
  Ross: YOU JUST MADE
ALL THAT UP...ON THE SPOT?
  [ CHUCKLES ]
 MEGAN, I AM SO SORRY ABOUT
THE WHOLE COMMERCIAL THING.
  I WASN'T TRYING
TO INSULT YOU -- REALLY.
 I MEAN, IF I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE AMAZING,
 I WOULDN'T HAVE TRIED SO HARD TO GET YOU TO STAY.
 IT JUST ALL CAME OUT... REALLY WRONG.
  [ SIGHS ]
  ANYWAY, THANKS FOR
HELPING US OUT ONE LAST TIME.
  YEAH, THE -- THE EXTRA 1,000 BUCKS DIDN'T HURT.
  [ CHUCKLES ]
  IT USUALLY DOESN'T,
BUT IF THAT'S WHAT IT COST
 TO END ON A GOOD NOTE, MONEY WELL SPENT.
  I LIED.
  THE EXTRA MONEY DIDN'T HELP.
  I'M ACTUALLY MAKING WAY LESS THAN I WOULD BE
  IF I WAS STANDING ON SET RIGHT NOW.
  SO...I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
  I INSULT YOU, AND THEN I OFFER YOU A PAY CUT,
  AND...YOU STILL FLY IN TO BAIL US OUT?
  WHEN YOU CALLED,
I WAS STANDING ON SET
 WEARING A SKIN-TIGHT, METALLIC UNITARD,
  GETTING LESSONS
IN HOW TO SWISH PROPERLY.
 COULDN'T HELP THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID
 AND WONDERING, "IS THIS
WHAT IT'S ALL BEEN FOR?"
  NO, COME ON. ERASE MY WORDS. I-I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG.
  IT'S A GREAT THING.
NO, IT'S MOUTHWASH.
  AND THE TRUTH IS,
WHEN I'M HERE, DOING...
 WHATEVER IT IS WE DO... [ CHUCKLES ]
 ...AND I'M WITH SOMEONE
AND THEY WANT TO GO LEFT
 AND I HELP THEM GO RIGHT
AND SOMETHING GETS FIXED...
  I KIND OF LOVE THAT.
  THAT'S...THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
  NO. THAT'S TERRIBLE.
 THAT IS NOT THE PLAN.
 THIS IS AN AD I ANSWERED BECAUSE I THOUGHT
 IT SOUNDED MORE INTERESTING THAN WAITING TABLES.
  I MEAN,
I-I-IT'S A PLACE WHERE I --
  I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT WE DO, LET ALONE
 BEING ABLE TO [LAUGHS]
EXPLAIN IT TO SOMEONE ELSE.
  IT'S A PLACE
WITH TWO FORMER CRIMINALS,
  A PROFESSOR
WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES,
  AND...A MILES.
  [ CHUCKLES ] I GET IT.
  I MEAN, SOMETIMES, THIS LITTLE GANG OF OURS SCARES ME.
  BUT THERE'S WORSE THINGS THAN STUMBLING INTO A PLACE
  AND DISCOVERING YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.
  WANT TO TELL THAT TO MY AGENT?
  WAIT, ARE YOU SAYING --
 WHEN YOU WALK OFF SET,
THEY TEND TO REPLACE YOU.
  MEGAN, ARE YOU SURE --
  IT'S MOUTHWASH.
  I'M REALLY GLAD YOU PICKED US.
  ME TOO.
  [ Voice breaking ] SOMEHOW.
  CLARK?
  YEAH. HI. HEY.
  WHERE IS EVERYBODY? HOME. I SENT THEM HOME.
  NOTHING NEW FROM ALLEN, WHICH ISN'T UNUSUAL,
  GIVEN THE SCALE OF INFORMATION THAT JANE HAS TO DIGEST.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
  I'M RESEARCHING.
  [ SIGHS ]
  IT DOESN'T...MAKE SENSE.
  IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.
  IT COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.
  [ SIGHS ]
  AND UNTIL I KNOW WHY IT HAPPENED,
  I CAN'T ASSURE ANYONE THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN,
  AND IF I CAN'T SAY IT WON'T HAPPEN,
  THEN...I CAN'T BE WITH BETH, AND IF I CAN'T BE WITH BETH,
  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL HER, AND SHE KEEPS CALLING ME,
  AND I KEEP NOT ANSWERING BECAUSE I NEED AN ANSWER
  BEFORE I ANSWER, SEE? CLARK.
  AND I THOUGHT -- I THOUGHT MAYBE THE --
  THE BLOOD WOULD TELL US SOMETHING,
  LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THERE WAS AN INTERACTION,
  SOMETHING I ATE, VITAMINS, S-- ADRENALINE SPIKE.
 YOU HAD YOUR BLOOD TESTED? TRIED.
  THEY DIDN'T KEEP THE SAMPLE. IT'S GONE. NO INFORMATION.
  SO I -- SO I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT MY JOURNALS
  OF THE LAST 15 YEARS OF MANIC EPISODES,
  LOOKING AT DOSAGES --
STOP. STOP.
 NO, I NEED
TO FIGURE THIS OUT!
  I DID IT.
  WHAT? I...
  [ SIGHS ]
  IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE A-A BIG THING.
  THE CASE WAS FALLING APART.
  MILES DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO WHAT WE NEEDED HIM TO DO,
 AND I JUST THOUGHT IF
I COULD JUST GET YOU
BACK FOR A FEW MINUTES,
 JUST LONG ENOUGH FOR YOU
TO TELL US WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO.
  THEN,
SUDDENLY, YOU WERE UP,
 AND -- AND YOU INSISTED
ON COMING ALONG, AND YOU
WERE FIXING THINGS,
 AND THEN I WAS TRYING
TO GET YOU HOME AND
BACK ON THE MEDS,
 AND BETH -- SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO DRIVE AND --
  I KNOW, BUT -- BUT -- BUT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?!
  W--WHAT'D YOU DO?!
  [ SIGHS ]
  I SWAPPED A PILL.
  I GAVE YOU A VITAMIN INSTEAD OF --
  GET OUT!
  CLARK, I DIDN'T MEAN TO --
  GET OUT!
  I DON'T EVER WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN, ALLEN.
  I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.
  I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOU.
 YOU KNOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DO IT.
  HOW YOU GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT
 AND WAKE UP EVERY DAY
AND LIVE WITH WHAT YOU DO.
 DON'T YOU FEEL ANYTHING
AFTER WHAT YOU'VE DONE?
  SHE'S RIGHT.
  EVERYTHING JANE SAID WAS TRUE.
 EVEN IF THE PERSON SHE WAS
SAYING IT ABOUT WAS MADE UP...
  I ACTUALLY AM AN AWFUL PERSON.
  I LIED AND CHEATED,
 AND IN THE END, I JUST...
WANTED TO GET AWAY WITH IT.
  I THINK I HAVE TO TELL MY WIFE.
  SHE NEEDS TO KNOW.
  I THINK YOU'RE HANDING ME THIS CHECK
  BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.
  THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.
  IF YOU TELL HER, WHAT'S THE POINT OF ALL THIS?
  WELL, FOR STARTERS, YOU HELPED JANE.
  SHE CHOSE TO LEAVE ON HER OWN,
 AND SHE'LL BE BETTER OFF FOR IT.
 AND...MAYBE TELLING ANNIE
 MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
FOR HER TO STAY WITH ME,
 BUT...HERE'S THE THING.
 I GOT TO A PLACE WHERE
I IMAGINED A LIFE WITHOUT HER,
  AND THEN I REALIZED I DIDN'T WANT THAT.
 I WANT HER. I CHOSE HER.
 SHE DESERVES THE SAME CHANCE TO CHOOSE.
 AND IF SHE CHOOSES ME, I WANT
HER TO CHOOSE THE REAL ME --
 THE ONE WHO DID MESS UP,
BUT ALSO WANTS TO DO BETTER.
  THE THING IS, ALLEN --
  AND I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE --
  THERE ARE SOME TRUTHS THAT YOU CAN'T COME BACK FROM.
  YOU TAKE A RISK WITH THE TRUTH.
 MAYBE IT WIPES EVERYTHING AWAY, BUT WHATEVER'S LEFT,
 IF THERE IS ANYTHING,
AT LEAST YOU KNOW IT'S REAL.
 AND IF THE RELATIONSHIP IS WORTH SAVING,
  THEN THAT IS A PLACE
THAT YOU CAN BUILD FROM.
 IN FACT, IT'S THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN BUILD FROM.
  ANYWAY, UM,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.
  YOU GOT ME
WHERE I NEEDED TO GO.
  [ DOOR OPENS ]
  CLARK.
  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?
  [ SIGHS ] I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR UP --
  HE WAS EXPLAINING HOW WE'D ALL MANAGED TO MISUNDERSTAND
  WHO IS AT FAULT FOR YOUR SITUATION.
  CLARK, WE SHOULD APOLOGIZE.
  WE -- WE DIDN'T KNOW --
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.
  [ SIGHS ]
  I'M SORRY, EVERYBODY.
  CLARK, DON'T -- [ DOOR OPENS, CLOSES ]
  [ SIGHS ]
  HEY. [ SIGHS ]
  WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?
  I DON'T KNOW.
 I CRASHED BETH'S CAR, ROSS!
  [ SIGHS ]
BETH COULD HAVE BEEN --
  IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO GO LIKE THAT. I JUST WANTED TO -- TO HELP --
 YEAH, WELL, THAT'S HOW IT DID GO, OKAY?
  AND THEN
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?
 YOU JUST WATCHED ME FLY AROUND,
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT --
  I-I THOUGHT I COULD FIX -- I THOUGHT IF I COULD GET BETH'S PARENTS
  TO SEE HOW GREAT YOU WERE, THEN ALL THIS WOULD JUST --
  IT WOULD'VE DISAPPEARED! THAT'S IT!
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, ROSS!
  GOD.
  YOU BURY BODIES WITH MORE BODIES!
 DON'T YOU EVEN SEE THAT?
  ALL YOU DO IS LIE.
  THAT'S ALL.
I MEAN, DO YOU SEE THAT?
  YEAH.
 THEN WHY'D YOU TELL ME?
 I TOLD YOU T-T-THEY COULDN'T
GIVE ME A BLOOD TEST.
  YOU WERE HOME FREE. SO, WHAT?
 SO, WHAT, DID YOU THINK
I WAS GONNA FORGIVE YOU?
 DID YOU THINK I WAS JUST GONNA
SAY, "OH, THAT MAKES SENSE.
 "YOU KNOW, THAT'S COOL.
THANKS FOR TELLING ME. LET'S
GO GRAB SOME DINNER"?
  I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'D DO.
  YEAH? WELL, THEN,
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
  THAT YOU WERE IN PAIN AND THAT IT WAS MY FAULT
  AND I NEEDED TO FIX IT.
  IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH, THE TRUTH IS,
  IF I COULD HAVE MADE UP SOMETHING ELSE
  THAT WOULD HAVE LET YOU STOP TEARING THROUGH YOUR JOURNALS
  AND BEATING YOURSELF UP, I'M SURE I WOULD HAVE,
  BECAUSE IN MY EXPERIENCE,
  LIES TEND TO HAVE SOFTER LANDINGS THAN THE TRUTH.
 BUT I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING IN THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT
  EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT BETH'S FAMILY NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND
  THAT THE ONLY CONDITION YOU CAN'T MANAGE
  IS THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A TERRIBLE BROTHER.
  OKAY? [ SIGHS ]
  THAT'S WHEN I GET TO THE TRUTH --
  WHEN I'M OUT OF EVERYTHING ELSE.
  AND, YES, THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.
  [ SIGHS ]
  DO YOU WANT TO GET BETTER?
  [ SCOFFS ] I'M TRYING.
  ARE YOU?
  THERE ARE --
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
  WRONG WITH ME, ROSS.
  [ SIGHS DEEPLY ] I KNOW THAT.
 BUT I LITERALLY GOT A PhD
  TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX THEM.
 I KEEP LOGS OF THE WAYS
THAT I FLY OFF THE RAILS
 SO I DON'T DO IT AGAIN.
  THAT'S TRYING.
  [ SIGHS ]
 YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
WHO'S EVER BEEN THERE FOR ME
 EVERY TIME I MESSED UP.
 NEVER ONCE DID YOU...
TELL ME THAT I WAS BROKEN
  OR SUGGEST I WAS A LOST CAUSE.
  YOU WERE ALWAYS JUST THERE.
 NO JUDGMENTS, NO DEMANDS.
 [ SIGHS ] BUT I CAN'T DO THE SAME FOR YOU.
  I CAN'T PRETEND THAT
THIS IS FINE AND YOU'RE FINE.
 THIS HAS TO BE THE END
 OF ONE THING OR ANOTHER --
  IT HAS TO BE THE END OF THE LIES...
  ...OR IT HAS TO BE THE END OF US.
  [ SIGHS ]
 OKAY, SO, WHICH IS IT?
  [ SCOFFS ] YOU REALLY HAVE TO ASK?
  NO.
  BUT I THINK
YOU REALLY NEED TO SAY.
  I AM TRYING, CLARK.
  YOU MIGHT NOT ALWAYS SEE IT.
  I MIGHT NOT ALWAYS SUCCEED, BUT I AM TRYING.
  THIS BUSINESS, THAT OFFICE, WITH YOU...
  THAT'S WHY I WANTED IT SO BAD.
  I WOULDN'T GIVE IT UP FOR ANYTHING.
  OKAY.
 I'M GONNA GO BACK INSIDE.
  I'M SORRY.
  I KNOW.
  [ SIGHS ]
  I'LL SEE YOU BACK AT THE OFFICE.
  SEE YOU BACK AT THE OFFICE.
  [ SIGHS DEEPLY ]
