 ♪ ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh ♪ Baylor. Where is that? Waco? - I've never been. - Darien: Waco. Yep. I mean, it's not Stanford, but we hold our own. Oh, so you know where I went to school? Everyone in behavior psychology has read your work, Dr. Edwards... even in Waco. Now, why don't we talk about why you're here? [Sighs]

 I don't know. I guess because my girlfriend thinks it's a good idea. To be honest, I've had very bad experiences with therapists. They've... they've had a few with you, too. So you know about my condition. That's good. What you might not know is that I spent the last 20 years of my life studying human psychology and behavior so that I could learn to manage my condition myself. How's that working out? Educate me. What exactly is it that you do? - [Elevator bell dings] - [Clark humming]

 Sam: Seriously? You don't know how to unfold a camping chair? Miles: My parents were not really into camping. They were more into glamping. Which is... ? It's like camping but... without any of the camping. Guys?! Furniture? See, I told you he'd notice. - You owe me lunch. - I do. Megan: Oh, you're here. - Do you have a second? - Uh... Yeah! What happened? Well, as predicted, my agent dumped me. No, with the furniture. Oh! Uh, Latrell's on that, I think. Here's the thing... with no chance of acting work, I kind of need a full-time job. Okay, I'm sorry. Back up. Um, your... your agent dumped you why? 'Cause Ross made me back out of a national commercial. - He did? - Yeah! Latrell, you're in charge of two accounts! That's it! - I'm not asking you to run the federal reserve! - Guys, why is there no furniture?! Look, i... it's fine. It's... it's nothing, all right? They took everything. We're working on it. Took everything? I thought the phone was ringing off the hook with new business. - It is, which is why you need a receptionist. - That's why we need furniture! - Yeah, Clark, um, I need - Ross insisted on a second account, - those three digits... - and I forgot to link it to the auto-pay - for the furniture rental place. - ... Off the back of your credit card. - Okay? I'll send them to you. - Megan: If the real stuff comes... Bye. Wait! I didn't know you were here. - Oh, you know what? And maybe in the future, - I actually just came here to... - people will be replaced by androids and holograms, - the wi-fi to search for an apartment - but right now... - because if I... - You know what? I'm gonna get out of your way. - No, no! You're looking for an apartment? [Sighs] Yeah, the girl I'm subletting from is coming back early, so I have to find a place quick. No, you can stay with me. - What? - What? While you look or, uh, uh, you know... It's okay. I'll find a place. No, I'll help you look, okay? Not that... I'm not saying that you don't... I'm... No, that... that would be great. When do you want to go? - Clark, Clark. - Does nobody else think it's ridiculous - that there's no receptionist here? - I really think... [All talking] Darien: Okay, here's what I'm hearing... besides having a condition which, in most people, takes all their energy to manage, you run an unusual company where you employ a staff of people who bring their own stresses and variables and rely upon you for virtually every decision. You're describing being a boss. That's what bosses do. Employing two convicted felons, one of whom is your brother, in a business designed to manipulate people's behavior. Is that what you'd say most bosses do? - Latrell: It will be here by tomorrow and signed... - Excuse me? Excuse me. I think we're lost. We're looking for Edwards and Associates. Ah. You found us! Uh, ignore the decor. It's part of what makes us a unique company. This is my brother, Clark. I'm Ross Edwards. - Welcome. - Hi. Hi. - Hi. - So, uh, what brings you? Someone is trying to take our baby. [Cooing] We've wanted a baby for as long as we've been together. We spent a fortune on in vitro and hormone therapy and then waded through the adoption process for five years. And finally, two weeks ago, little Ethan here. Ross: So, what's the problem? We adopted him in Indiana where the birth mother has 30 days to contest the adoption. - Hmm. - And she changed her mind. Yeah. Which happens. I mean, we... we knew that going into this. There's... there's more. - This is her. - [Sighs] She grew up on the streets in Gary. Drugs, larceny, assault. Barely 18, and she's spent more time in the courts than the classroom. We can't send him to where he won't be safe. Please. So, how does this work? Within 30 days, she can ask for the baby back? Well, yeah. And she just requested a hearing. - When's the hearing? - Tomorrow. Tomorrow?! [Ethan cries] I'm sorry. It's organic. He loves it. Yeah. - Yeah. - [Crying stops] I know it doesn't make sense. We just met Ethan, but... He's a part of our family now. Clark: Oh, i... it makes total sense. The human baby is born physically helpless but has the mind control of an alien super race. Right now, your brains are... are surging so much oxytocin. You're forging bonds that will last a lifetime. Ross: [Sighs] We want to help, of course. We'll try our hardest. But we're dealing with an unstable mother, and we only have one day to work... No one will take your baby. I promise. Let us work on it, and we'll call you when we finalize an approach. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks for coming in. - Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. - Beautiful baby. - Thanks. - Got your hands full. - Yes, we do. [Sighs] "I promise"? Look, if we go in front of a judge, I want these parents to project certainty, confidence, all right? I want them calm, reassured. Well, now that they're fully reassured, can you actually deliver on what you just promised? Yes. Almost certainly. [Sighing] Excuse me. Miss? Would you pay 10 bucks to see something truly amazing? 10 bucks? That's a lot of money, kid. What if I told you I could knock down this parking meter with my bare hands? Um... Okay. [Metal clangs] All right. Yeah. You're on. [Laughs] All right. Don't spend it in one place. You're still just an old softy. My God! Oh! Martin! What are you doing here? You should have asked for $20, kid. Cool trick. Thanks. All right. Good work. God, you look good. And you're still a very convincing liar. [Laughs] What are you doing here? Well, I was in town. I thought I'd look you up. Chased down every name I could ever remember you ever using until it occurred to me to try your real one. [Chuckles] Yeah, well, that's me now... just plain, old Sam. - You're not working? - I am working. In fact, I... I got to get back or I'm gonna be late. Well, I'll walk you. - Yeah? - Yeah. [Chuckles] So, when you say working, you don't mean working. - You mean you have a job. - [Laughs] Paycheck, taxes, et cetera. Yeah, I got one of those little rubber mats under my office desk. - Wow. - [Chuckles] That's great, Sam. Really. Yeah, it feels good. Listen, um... I'm sorry I didn't call you right when I got out. Oh, that's okay. I imagine your to-do list was pretty long at that point. Hey, taxi! So, how does this work? I call your secretary and make an appointment? I'm only in town for a couple of days. I want to take you for a cup of coffee. Yeah, sure. Uh, where are you staying? I'm running a little lean. Still looking around. Well, you know you can stay with me. - Yeah? - Yeah. It's only a day or two. No, you... you stay as long as you like. I got one of those pull-out couches, a little kitchenette. Might even have some baby carrots in the fridge. [Chuckles] I missed you, Sam. Yeah, I missed you, too. [Sighs] But you owe me 10 bucks. How about we target the judge with age-bias priming? No, we don't know enough about the judge. No, we have a baby in a good home, so we just need to prime the judge not to remove him. How about change aversion? Yes! Wait. No. Problem there is the baby's already changed families, so if we prime the judge against change, he may just return things to their original state. And send the baby back to where he won't be safe. Yeah, we need to maintain something that's already established, so... Status-quo reinforcement. Really? That's a thing? So, what are we doing? What do you mean, "what are we doing"? I thought you were getting us furniture! I'll get to that. I want to help. - With what? - The case. I grew up with girls like the birth mother, which means I know how to approach her. That's great, only we're not targeting the girl. No, t... t... t... the teenage brain is erratic, and then you add drugs and emotional issues? [Whistles] The highly rational mind of a judge, on the other hand, is focused and decisive. Oh, yes! - What? You got it? - What? I found a great apartment for Beth. Can we get back to the case? Never mind. It's below the "L." She'll never sleep. - Status-quo reinforcement plus... - No. What if I work the first week for free... - Shh. Please don't shush me. - The "L." She's never gonna sleep. - Status-quo reinforcement. - You're apartment hunting? Overload! Cognitive overload! Cognitive overload? It's like, uh, choice exhaustion. Your brain has a limited reserve of energy for making decisions, so if you deplete that reserve, your brain automatically defaults to taking the easiest available solution. So, people come to you with life-altering, critical problems, and you make decisions which have an immeasurable impact on them while being pulled in a thousand directions? W... what are you asking? Well, I mean, I know I only went to Baylor, but I have to wonder... Uh, if you were the client, would you trust your fate to someone who is struggling to keep it all together? Would you hire you? [Keyboard clacking] Hey. Hey. Saw your light. I'm just going over Clark's plan for tomorrow. I wish we had more time. Judges kind of make me nervous. - Can't imagine why. - Yeah. Although the thought of annoying the hell - out of one of them is kind of appealing. - [Chuckles] You know, we're, uh, sort of teamed up tomorrow. You want to grab some dinner, talk about the plan? Dinner? I mean, you know, dinner. I eat. You eat. We all eat. Yeah... you are my boss, so is there some sort of employee handbook I should read, company policy? We don't even have furniture. If we had employee handbooks, I'd be stacking them for chairs. [Chuckles] Uh, eh, sure. I could eat. [Sighs] But... I'm buying. You have any money? Well, not in the literal sense, no. Hmm. Join the club. [Cork pops] So, she asks me, "what did you learn in prison?" Seriously? "What did you learn in prison?" - I knew what the parole lady wanted to hear... - [Chuckles] Uh, personal responsibility, contributing to society, et cetera, et cetera. Mm-hmm. But what I was thinking ah... was that, uh, I learned two AA batteries and a disposable razor make an excellent cigarette lighter, and I learned that you can cook almost anything with, uh... boiling water and a 20-gallon garbage bag. I learned... oh, I learned what my real hair color was. - Wow. - Yeah, well, I'd been dying it for so long - that I had no idea anymore. - Mm. And actually, you can get pretty decent hair products in there, but what you had to trade to get them... ooh, not worth it. [Soft music plays] Do people, uh... people ask you what it was like? [Inhales deeply] Uh... No. But I don't know that many people. You? Yeah, yeah. But I don't think they really want to know, so [Chuckles] I just tell them it's like summer camp but with less inappropriate touching. Yeah, the men's prison and the women's prison across the lake, they have mixers. Care to dance, Miss? [Southern accent] I would love to. But, you see, I got shackles on my feet. [Southern accent] Ooh, well, that's okay. Fortunately for you, I learned how to pick a lock in prison. Oh, well, isn't that convenient. I bet that you just charm the orange jumpsuits off of all the ladies in here. [Normal voice] Well, sometimes that's the only way - you can actually tell that they are ladies. - [Chuckles] [Normal voice] Well, I hope that you don't have any doubts about this one. Well, it doesn't hurt to double-check. [Both chuckle] Think your house guest has gone to bed yet? Mm... probably. It would be such a shame to wake him up when I got in. Yeah, it would be a shame. [Moaning] Oh, God. You understand that this is gonna cost you some quality shampoo. Okay. [Both chuckle] Good morning. - Hey. - I brought you doughnuts. You know, Chicago has got amazing doughnuts now. That's great. Were you out all night making them? - Ha ha ha. - [Chuckles] Sorry about that. Things kind of got away from me. - Can I ask you a question? - Yeah. You working something? What? Found this article about the place where you work. Reporter didn't think much of it, but he mentions the people who work there, and I see this Miles Hood. Hood, as in his last name is on buildings across Chicago. And then I think my little Sam landed a job right next to this massive trust-fund kid. Yeah? Total coincidence? - Yes. - You're not working an angle on him? It's not like that. It's a job. A real job. And he's my friend. Okay. That's good. But I know you're not my kid, but I've tried to look out for you like you were. For all I know, I'm the only one who ever came to visit you when you were locked up. You always seemed happy to see me. You make parole, you get out, and you don't call. And I... I guess I'm sitting here thinking, "what did I do?" See, it wasn't about you. But then I see this, and I think, "she's making a play at something and she just thinks it's not my thing." I mean, I know you always thought my moves were... kind of boring. No, you weren't boring. I was boring! It's why I was so against that thing with the guy you thought you were in love with. Oh, here we go again. Point is, not calling because you're working a score, I almost get that. But if not that, what? What did I do? Nothing. I promise. I... I just needed to figure out how to do this right. Okay. Okay. Sure. I think I just missed you. We've been together a long time. - For me, those are happy memories. - Mm. Uh, look, Sam, uh... [Inhales sharply] ... as much as I wish it would, this is not gonna ask itself. I... I... I'm in a situation. I need to keep moving. Trying to keep a low profile, all cash. And I'm just running low. Uh... no, no, it's... it's okay. Um, how much? Strictly a loan, okay? I have the money, and I will send it to you. It's just I'm out of cash and I can't go to an ATM. Martin, it's fine. It's fine. Whatever you can spare, whatever's handy. Yeah, I got about... $1,800 in the bank. Why don't we go now? Means a lot, Sam. Really. So, how does giving this judge a bad meal let us keep our baby? By convincing his brain that changing something that works is bad. Latrell, more fork options. We need to overload him. Okay. There we go. Just so... o... okay. Hey, turn the heat up in here. He needs to be really uncomfortable. First we get our operative Megan to get Nayfeld to break from his status quo... change his lunch routine and go to a restaurant that we rented out. Judge Nayfeld? Such a pleasure to meet you. I've heard lots of amazing things about you from Judge Lehman. Oh? How do you know Lehman? I'm with the new Josh Beylin restaurant, and we're trying to build our courthouse clientele. He was one of our first customers and now also our biggest fan, and he asked us to buy you lunch. Clark: And then when he gets to the restaurant... choice exhaustion. Here's a menu for you, sir. And this is our prix fixe chef's lunch. Here are our cocktails for the day. This is the wine list for you. And this is our dessert menu. We overload him. Sparkling, still, tap, mineral, flavored? Tap is fine. Ice... cubed, no ice, chipped ice? Ice, cubed. We make him so mentally depleted, his brain can't make any more hard choices. Then status-quo reinforcement. Basically, we make sure he has a miserable experience. Wow. What do you do? Just a judge. Can judges do that? - Like, get things for free? - Of course you can. It's Chicago. No, it... it's not like that. No, just ignore him. Yeah, it's easy. She's been doing it for years. - No, he doesn't like it when I talk to other men. - You know what? A judge might come in handy if you keep it up. See? He's just insecure because I'm a lot younger than him. What are you talking about? You're slightly younger. Okay, let's just say that between the time that you were born and I was born, a German Shepherd could be born, live a full life, and die! Because the judge deviated from his routine, - his brain will blame this bad experience he had... - [indistinct shouting] This is not the first time! ... on choosing something new over something established. By the time he's done with lunch, he'll have paid so dearly for deviating from the status quo, he's primed to stay the course. So, when he comes to your case, he should take the path of least resistance... maintain the existing contract and leave the baby with you. Woman: Mr. and Mrs. Bradley, I'm terribly sorry, but Judge Nayfeld had to leave unexpectedly. Your case is currently being rescheduled. My apologies for the inconvenience. One second. Um, wait, wait. Uh, just... I... I'm with the Bradleys'... attorney. W... what's going on? What happened to Judge Nayfeld? Sounds like food poisoning. Hey, Clark, Clark! You should have seen Miles... What happened? Did we win? Are you familiar with Newton... Isaac Newton? Not sure. Did he go to Baylor? [Chuckles] Well, he worked up this crazy idea that bodies in a system don't move in isolation but are affected by every other body in that system. [Sighs] I realize that my actions have an effect on other people, Doctor. I'm acutely, acutely aware of that. And theirs affect you, making it hard to maintain your equilibrium. Newton even called his observations "laws," lest we think they don't apply to us. - [Telephone ringing] - Ross: It's not as bad as it sounds. We... we poisoned a judge, Ross! We gave a guy a tummy ache. Let's not blow things out of proportion. A guy who was primed to fix this. [Ringing continues] Just waiting to see if the phone will answer itself. Give it a minute. Think it might. All I did was ask if you wanted to spend the rest of your life selling mouthwash and spandex. Which would have paid my rent, which is now two weeks overdue. Okay. I'm sorry. When we have money, you are hired. Sam: So, what now? Well, the Bradleys are in a total state of panic, so we don't want them anywhere near the courthouse. And their case is rescheduled for day after tomorrow, but we have no way of knowing what judge will hear it. So we target the birth mother. It's not ideal, but it's what we've got. It might not be so bad. I mean, we're talking about a girl who, for nine months, believed that giving the kid up was the right thing to do. Excellent point! That's an excellent point! I didn't just discover a planet. Why are you so excited? She made a difficult, rational decision... And then went back on it. Why? What happened? She had a baby. Yes! Hormones. Her protective maternal instincts kicked in. Okay, so how do we turn off a mother's maternal instinct? I will call my mother, and I will get some tips. Uh, p... p... perceptual rivalry. Oh! Yeah. Yes! Okay. Ready? [Chuckles] Rabbit or a duck? - Rabbit. Rabbit. - Duck. Duck. *** Trippy, right? Your brain has to choose what image to see even if you're aware of both animals. It can't perceive them simultaneously. It's called "perceptual rivalry." Same thing happens when we make a decision. Anthony Jack studies! Yes, and Jack showed, just like the optical illusion, we can either engage our emotional network or our logical one, but not both. So, how do we get this girl's logical part back in charge so she rethinks this whole thing? Puzzles. Humor me. We find out the reasoning behind her initial decision to give up the child. Then Megan goes in with a set of logic puzzles that she says helps us identify which aspects of motherhood that she'll find the most challenging. But the real reason for the puzzles is to engage her analytic network. Yes! And then with her analytic network in gear, Megan goes in with a set of scripted questions that Miles will write to remind her of the logical reason why she gave up the child in the first place. Thinking rationally, she'll see her maternal urges as the short-sighted instincts that they really are and change her mind about keeping the child. How can you be so sure? Because she'll be thinking with her head... And not her heart. Where were you to cheat off in high school? College. Oh. [Sighing] Hmm. - Um... - Hey, uh... Do... do you want... were... - No. - What? Oh, no. Both: Were you gonna say something? - [Chuckles] - You talk. Go first. What? Um, I was gonna ask you to, um, maybe join me for a dinner tonight. - Oh. Oh. - But then I changed my mind. Well, that's good, 'cause, uh, apparently dinner makes me very tired the next day. - I know. - Latrell: Ross, can I talk to you for a sec? Oh, uh... yeah. What's up? Uh, I found a way to pay Megan. Just want to talk you through it. - Excuse me. - Great. Uh, let's... my office. Before we get into payroll, what the hell was that? That? Well, you can file that in the "none of your business" cabinet. I know you, Ross, and I know how your relationships end. Look, I may not have liked Sam at the start... one recovering con artist for our company seemed like plenty... but she's a big part of the team now. And when whatever this is blows up, I just want... Oh, pl... this coming from the guy who's doing accounting backflips to keep Megan around? Yes, well, this isn't about office romances. This is about your record with relationships, period. Really? Look, this company was your idea, Ross. Now, you talked a lot of us into joining. I'm just asking you to think... is this really the best thing for it? Okay, so you have three light bulbs, but you've only got one switch, and... this is not a good time for a logic puzzle. So... [Indistinct conversations] I was so hungry the last few weeks. Feels weird not wanting to eat. Well, look, don't beat yourself up about it. Our organization, uh, is here to help girls in your position. But in order for us to help you, we need to know all about you. So, why don't you tell us about when you first learned you were pregnant? [Inhales deeply] Um, I was in rehab again. I busted out a few weeks before, and that's when it happened. [Scoffs] It's funny, 'cause rehab's the last place I wanted to be till I found out I was pregnant. And then I was, like, grateful to be there. And why is that? 'Cause... home sucks. Pretty much had to get high all the time just to get through it. Are you still using? Are you kidding? I was pregnant. Addiction is extremely powerful. I've been clean for almost a year. Having that baby... I mean, I knew I couldn't keep him or nothing. But when he was inside me, that baby was mine. I don't know. I just... I started to see things different. Different how? Like... What I did mattered... to someone. I quit using... and I went back to school and almost got my G.E.D. I'm gonna go to college. Then... why did you give him up? 'Cause what kind of mom was I supposed to be? I had no business with a baby. But that's different now. I... I can do this. You've stayed clean? Mm-hmm, yeah, I got a job now, um, at this really cute store, and I'm getting my own place. I... I can be a good mom to that baby. I know I can. I just... I want him to know how much I love him. But I can't do that if he's not with me. Yeah. I think I have all I need. Thank you for your time, Miss Mayi. Uh, go. Um, our... our group will be in touch with you really soon. Or not. [Clears throat] May not need us. It sounds like you're on the right track. Wait. What are you doing? This girl is not what we signed up for. We're not doing this. Ross: I'm not trying to make you feel bad. - I'm just saying... - Good, 'cause I don't. Look, I really need to focus on this. Beth has less than a week. This is her first apartment. I just want it to be perfect. [Sighs] We all do. Just promise me the next time that you pull the plug on something, you'll let me know. I mean, I'm not emitting oxytocin or anything. I'd just like you to consider my needs a little. That's all. - Sure. Yes. - Thank you. Is there a difference between a bachelor and a studio? - [Knock on door] - Well, yeah. Sam says we dropped the case. Why is there still no desks? I thought you were getting paperwork. - Why? - Because we need furniture! No. I mean the case. This is important. Critical. Clark wouldn't pull out if he didn't think it was the right thing to do. Except how would he know? I grew up with kids with moms like her. You know where they are now? Locked up, dealing, doping, or dead... every one of them. You didn't meet her. You're judging her based on a bias. We all did. That's what people do. - But sometimes those biases are wrong. - You're not hearing me. I'm from this girl's world. Well, you did it. You got out. I was selfish. Yeah. No kids. No passengers. I clawed my way out. I left my own brother behind. Plus, I never took a step down the road to drugs and crime this girl's been walking for years. Latrell, people change. Yes, she wants the chance to change, to face her challenges. Clark, anyone can pull themselves together for a week or two if they've got something to prove. It doesn't last. A baby does. Look... I hear what you're saying. I do. I'm just not willing to play God on this one. Oh, you're still playing God, Clark. You just switched sides. Um... the Bradleys are here. [Sighs] We had a deal! Our new hearing is tomorrow! What are we supposed to do now? You still have a great case. We're just not gonna have any further impact on it. [Voice breaking] You made me a promise. And then what? You spend 15 minutes with this girl and you break it? How exactly did she convince you she'd make a good mother, hmm? Hmm, did she tell you how she served time for cracking another girl's skull open? - Ross: Look... - A month before she got pregnant, she was arrested selling drugs. If this baby is taken from us, you will have destroyed the lives of everyone involved. Can you live with that? Darien: And you feel good about your choice? I made a calculated decision. Followed through with my best judgment. That's all any of us can hope to do. But isn't the whole basis of your research... I mean your whole company... predicated on the idea that our decisions are controlled by our environment in ways we're not even conscious of? I mean, this judge, for instance. Didn't you say he was powerless to make a clear decision based on... uh... what was it? Cognitive... - Overload. - "Cognitive overload." No... air quotes. It's a thing. All right, fine. But isn't it possible you simply reached your own cognitive overload and needed to remove yourself from an emotionally complex situation? Weren't you juggling a variety of stresses when you agreed to take the case? Isn't it possible you dove right in without weighing both sides because your mind was so overwhelmed that it jumped to a hasty conclusion in order to avoid making the choice more difficult? - [Laughs] - And since when does ordering a Manhattan become a lesson in the culinary arts? Yeah, I know, right? Herbs and spices and orange wedge. It's like, "come on. We're not preparing a Thanksgiving meal here." [Chuckles] "Just pour the bourbon." [Laughs] [Sighs] What? Oh, um, yeah. It's... it's just me now. My, um... my house guest has moved on, so you can come in. I want to. I do. I just... Uh-oh. No "uh-oh." I just... if you don't want to do this, then I don't want to do this. - So, it was fun, but I'll see you tomorrow. - No, look. I didn't say I didn't want to do it. I... I mean, I... I want to do it. I just don't want to do it in the way that I usually do it. Well, how do you usually do it? Because we did it in various ways. Will you shut up? Not that. This. Instead of me coming in and proceeding down the path that I normally take, which is to say the path that usually leads me to screwing things up entirely, maybe we just do things differently. Dinner, flowers, a movie. I want to get it right. Well, then don't... serenade me. You serenade me, I'm gonna laugh. And no carnations, okay? Roses only. - Get out of here. - Hmm. Go away. [Sighs] Good night. [Sighs] Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? [Grunts] I thought that you left [Chicago accent] Chicago. [Chuckles] Can't get enough of Chicago. [Grunts] What the hell happened to you? Let me see. Come here. Let me see! Oh! [Inhales sharply] It's nothing. I'm fine. I just came to give your money back. You mean the money that I loaned you yesterday? Why... whoa. - "Dear Sam... " - Don't read that! Don't read that! - It's not finished! That... - "... You are stronger than you realize. "I'm prouder than you know. I... I'm glad I got to see that smile one last time before... " What the hell is going on? I thought I had a sure thing. And I ended up with some... unforgiving partners. How much do you owe? More than you and I have ever laid our hands on. So, then we just get it. Right? I mean, we've... we've worked our way out of tight spots before. We get it. We throw something together, right? And then we, uh... I'm not dragging you into this! You're out! You're straight! That's a good thing! Stay that way. And you're bleeding on my living room floor, and you're leaving me a note that basically says, "hey, I'll see you in the next lifetime"? No. Nag, nag, nag. God, just tell me how much. We'll figure it out. Don't be stubborn. We could pull a dozen jobs and not make a dent. I have to put an end to this myself. [Sighs] How? Hey, what does that mean? "Bye, Sam." That's what it means. No, no, no. Hey. Would you just... would you just sit back down, please? We can figure this out. When is the last time you just... not this time. I weighed all the options before I ran. There's no way out of it! - Hey, what about... - Aah. What about Miles? - No. I'm not dragging you back into this. - No, just... just hear me out. All I would do is... is open up the door. Uh, you make your play, you keep me clean, and then when it's all over, you're paid up, I'm back on the straight and narrow, and, you know, the Hoods have to live with one less wing [Chuckling] in some museum. [Chuckles] Why are you doing this, Sam? Because it's what you would do for me. Oh, you're gonna love it. Uh, it's got recessed lighting, uh, loads of closet space. Oh, I'm sure I'll love it. Oh! You know what? We got to stop by the, um, furniture-rental place. I'll get the papers from Latrell. Is Latrell in yet? Uh, no, he was for a minute, and then poof. Poof where? I don't know. It was kind of weird. What was weird? Well, he was asking a lot of questions about the case, the adoption couple, and the... and the puzzles. But he... he didn't say where he was going? No, he just tore out of here. Uh... Where's your clipboard? Which clipboard? The clipboard with the logic puzzles and the questions you wrote to get the girl to back off. W... wait. You don't think that Latrell would... Play God? [Sighs] [Cellphone ringing] The cellphone! Can we track the cellphone? Calm down, Clark. We're not the NSA. I don't need to calm down! I need to find Latrell! These are just some of the questions you have to ask yourself. How much do you make at your job per hour? How many hours of child care are you gonna need? What's it gonna cost for child care per hour? Do you really have the means to take care of this baby, not just 1 or 2 years, but 18 years? Being a mother is about doing what's best for both of you. What you need to focus on is becoming the woman you want that child to find when you do see him again. Dr. Edwards. I don't know what you did or how you did it, but I wanted to come here and say thank you in person. We got a call from Leanne Mayi. She dropped her case and confirmed the adoption. I'm glad to hear it all worked out. Got to admit, I thought twice about paying you after our last meeting. Yeah, yeah, that was... Well, that was all part of the plan. The... the backup plan. In... in case you guys got a new judge, we needed you desperate instead of confident. Sorry we caused you any stress. Well, you certainly had us fooled. [Elevator bell dings] Anyway, thank you again. Excuse me. I'll walk you out. How could you do this? I definitively said we were gonna leave this one alone. I heard you, but I never agreed. - You don't get to agree. - I know you're a genius, Clark, and I know you know a lot of things about a lot of things, - but that girl's life is not one of them. - She was committed. She changed! And she can stay changed if that's what she wants. She has a chance now and a chance to get out and a chance to prove that, in the long run, she made the right choice so that if and when she does finally become a part of that kid's life, it'll be because she earned it. So you do what you got to do. Fire me if that's it. But I'm not apologizing for a damn thing. Darien: So, would you still argue this is a supportive, healthy environment? Why does challenging have to equal unhealthy? It doesn't. But if you struggle with shaky hands, you don't challenge yourself by diffusing bombs. Yeah, but you keep framing this as the reason why I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing. I mean, this week was as bad as it gets. Crazy-stressful on all fronts. But I focused and managed. So how about, "nice job, Clark. Way to engage your coping mechanisms." How about that? [Chuckling] Okay. Yes, you did an exceptional job of white-knuckling your way through a very tough week. But we're not talking about mustering all your will for just a few days. And this Latrell was right. It's like that girl. Short-term change is easy, especially when you're trying to prove something. But what happens when you stop focusing on what it is you're trying to prove? What happens when you let your guard down, when things come calling that you can't just push aside? This triumph is deceptive. - * the truth don't stop * - You can dodge traffic for a minute. But you keep playing in the street, eventually you will get hit. You need to be looking for ways to simplify your life. The more complicated you let things become, the harder they are to maintain. What do you think? Perfect, right? Yeah. Yeah, it's good. Wait. Do you hate it? Did I miss something? You're right. ♪ like the moon ♪ A life with no complications, - red flags, potholes... - * the truth don't stop * ... would probably be a lot safer for me. ♪ it's really coming ♪ But at what cost? - * the truth don't stop * - [Inhales deeply] I think you should move in with me. [Sighs] - * the truth don't stop * - Clark, are you serious? You wanted to know why I came here. Here's why. Because I don't want to be safe... if all I get from it is safety. [Inhales deeply] What if I leave my hair in the drain or I grind the coffee too fine? I mean, won't those things drive you nuts? Yes. Totally. ♪ let the rain fall ♪ But I think it's worth it. I want what life gives you when you step off the curb. ♪ let the rain fall ♪ [sighs] So... Where do we start? ♪ let the rain fall ♪ - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com -
